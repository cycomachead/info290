"Overall: As dubbels go, this isn't at all bad - it's unlikely to be a revelatory life-changer but that doesn't mean it's not worthy of attention. Insofar as dubbels and their ilk can be considered 'easy' drinking, this one is - definitely a good entry point to the style. A good, solid beer."

"O: Very solid dubbel, great drink overall."
"Slight hint of yeast in both smell and taste but rounded and moreish"
""
""
""
"It is worth a second try."
""
""

"Mouthfeel: Medium bodied, refreshing, light carbonation."

"This is a pretty nice dubbel that I had on tap.  It looks very nice and undeniably Belgian.  The nose is very yeasty with some doughy alcohol and spices.  The flavor is a bit thin and very sweet.  It is light-medium bodied with a lingering sweetness.  Fairly drinkable though I feel like it could be more substantive, less sweet, and a little heftier.  Didn't change my life, worth a shot if you've never had it and like Belgians."

"Enjoy"

"Pint on tap at National Beer Hall in Calgary. A dark reddish brown with a single finger of light beige frothy head. Aroma is notably sweet and fruity, lots of grape, prune, apple, pear, and peach notes with faint cinnamon and brown sugar. Palate is similarly sweet, with the expected brown spice or cola-like elements ratcheted down in favor of fruit roll up and a caramel sweetness that becomes quite cloying as one proceeds through a full pint. Faintly sour at times but the overarching effect of caramel-drizzled fruitcake is difficult to ignore. Body on the thin side and the carbonation is higher than expected. Should be drier. I do not consider this to be a great dubbel. Some fruitiness is pleasant but should not be the dominant flavor in this style. Avoid in favor of more authentic examples, which are plenty easy to obtain."

"Grimbergen is a mass-produced beer which means, like mass-produced anything, it offers average-quality at best. But if you're new to dark, Belgian, or Abbaye beers it's one you'll likely fall in love with (that is, until you try the likes of Westmalle, St. Bernardus, Rochefort, or Corsendonk). But even experienced drinkers are still likely to find it a perfectly serviceable, enjoyable ale. I do."

"A very nice Belgian beer here that didn't pour great but started to pick up soon after that, it was malty and had some sweetness in there giving it a fairly basic but pleasant taste that was well balanced and went down quite easily. There was a touch of alcohol on the nose but this didn't seem to follow through to the taste in any significant way, a good beer and one I wouldn't be against trying again."

"O – A cracking example of the style this beer has no flavour out of place. I have come across other that had more complex flavour but this beer gets by just fine doing what it does and doing it well."

"Review based on the BJCP2008 guidelines (style 18B). Bottle 33 cl - Batch 23:30 . AROMA: some ester aromas reminiscent of raisins and some dried cherries. spicy alcohols and a sweet and caramely background. some solventy alcohol notes are present. no hop aromas and no diacetyl. APPEARANCE: dark amber color with ruby tint. clear. average tanned moussy head with good retention. TASTE: low sweet malt flavour with a semi-sweet finish. low bitterness and no hop flavours. very faint to absent esters. PALATE: medium-low body with medium carbonation. OVERALL: a poor representation of a Belgian ale with poor malt complexity."
"Not the best dubbel, but certainly no complaints."

"Grimbergen Cuvee Ambree )Dubbel (Double)) - 6.5% - Bottle at Rubens in Antwerp poured to Grimbergens glass. Pours dark brownish with some purple hues, and a half finger creamy off white head. Aroma is nice, with lots of dark fruits, figs, prunes, brown sugar. Smells very sweet. Flavor is figs and prunes, some brown sugar, and a slightly dirty finish here that lingers a bit unpleasantly. Prickly carbonation, soft mouthfeel otherwise, and relatively smooth down the throat. Not bad but the finish is a little offputting and downgrades things a bit."

"Taste/feel: Moderate carbonation with a surprisingly full body are the highlight of this beer. A lot of sweetness, but remains drinkable as hell through it all. Zero off-flavors. Great for the style/those who enjoy malty/sugary sorts of beers. Substantial dark fruit and bready flavors. Not a huge flavor depth, but this doesn't need it. Great example of the style."

"O: I'm fairly new to the style, but I liked this dubbel; it goes down very easily, and while it lacks a powerful character, it does make for a very pleasant experience. I'll definitely be buying more of this one."
""
"O: strange and somewhat delicious, industrial abbey ale... feel like it's sacrilege, this being filtered, but it makes for a clean, refreshing drink - compared to the lot of bottle-conditioned dubbels, the flavors here are bright and explosive"

"Found this at a tavern while on vacation in Greece recently. I remembered that I thought it was fantastic, but that might have been because I had been forced to drink many truly pedestrian pilsners and lagers on the trip; it seems that at least 95% of establishments there only have Amstel, Heineken and a few other local beers; almost nobody makes an effort to get good beers into the country. This looked, smelled, tasted and felt great and yet somewhat lighter that I would have thought. Still, I was so thankful when I stumbled upon the bar that had it and a few other imports (Blue Moons as well) on tap. A nice drink!"

"Pours a very dark red colour with a very creamy looking head - which unfortunately disappears rather quickly. Smells like cherries, licorise and malt - very nice. Even while only 6.5%, it has a strong taste of alcohol. The malts are very well balanced by the hop bitterness - just enough to make it neither too sweet nor too bitter. Warm caramel flavours mingle with the malts. It has a very smooth mouthfeel, not at all dry. Just a hint more carbonation would do some good. Overall this beer is definitely worth a try and I'll be buying it again for sure."

"Paid almost $15 for a six pack, that's the last time I buy it. pours with a lacy tan head and looks nice in the glass giving off a glowing mahogany color. Taste is too sweet for my liking and has an overwhelming note of sour apples. I've had much better Dubbels in the past, this one just doesn't live up to expectations. It was a chore to polish off all six bottles since I didn't find it very enjoyable at all."

"330ml bottle. Grimbergen Goblet glass. Deep ruby color, red lights. Tan, creamy foam remains as a thin layer on top. Toasted, sugary & red currant aromas with syrup hues. Sweet & sparkling upfront. Medium to light body. Moderate to high carbonation. Oily to watery texture. Hints of grape, spicy & herbal bitterness. Bitter finish & sugary aftertaste. Artificial & cloying."

"Had on tap at T.J. Finley's, Bay Shore NY. A good deep brown with head and lacing very ample. It has a wonderfully tart fruity sugar and spice smell, which carries through in the flavor. The brown sugar and raisin taste is balanced by the hops, which evenly accentuate the drinking experience without dominating. The feel is lighter than some others, but that only helps make this a highly drinkable beer. I've had Grimbergen in the bottle as well - either way, solidly recommendable."

"A simple but tasty dubbel, glad to have tried it."

"Overall / Drinkability: Great looking beer! I think though, this needs to be paired with a meal. The Mrs. loved it by itself with the sips she had, but I kept wanting to some food to have with it, so not a beer to stand alone and therefore not very drinkable for me in the absence of food. But definitely a very interesting beer overall to pick out all the flavors. Plus from what I read, this one is very close to style, so I have to give it good marks for that."
"Overall: This looked like an interesting beer, but it didn't deliver. Not bad but not one I'd get again as it is a weak example of this style."
""
""
""
"The feel is carbonated harshness with a slight alcohol warmth. It's also a bit thin but otherwise I highly recommend this Double Ale."

"Poured a deep reddish brown, with a slight ring of white head. When held to light it was a brilliant ruby red. Very beautiful to the eye. Scents of grape, slight hints of alcohol and dark fruit. A good nose, quite unique, and very fruity. I like it. Flavors of grape, prune, very slight hints of apple, blackberry and Belgian candy sugar sweetness. Very nice, sweet and complex with a good fruity character. As it warms more prune dominates the taste. It's quite nice, a bit sweet, but overall very good. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with low carbonation. Somewhat standard for a dubbel, maybe a bit low on the carbonation front. Overall it's a very good dubbel, a nice surprise. The fruity flavors are pleasant and it was quite complex in many ways. Worth trying at the very least."

"o: a solid dubble. nothing more, nothing less. if you like sweet beers, give this a shot. it's a pleasant drinker, with nothing offensive about it. still, average dubble. it may not be great, but its enjoyable."
""
""
""
""
"A 'dubbel', sure, but in a rather newbie, weakly pandering manner. Complexity seems lost on this one, and the adjunct ingredients, while not overly apparent, still add little to the mix, if at all. Easy enough to drink, but hardly up to the measure of almost any other true Belgian offering of the sort."
"One of my standby ales, if I don't know what I want in the liquor store I know that I'll be pleased with a six pack of this in the refrigerator."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"All-in-all, this beer was slightly disappointing to me due to the flavors within the beer counter acting each others positive qualities. However, the latter is just my opinion and I encourage everyone to try something at least twice: once for curiosity and twice for the hell of it"

"Overall a fairly nice if unremarkable beer."
""
"The beer brings a dark-amber body, and the almost-white neck is not as well-retained as expected, given the style. The aroma has strong caramel notes, with toasty and cherry-like ideas in the background. The alcohol is (too) perceptible. The finish is short and smooth, leaving a subtle hop presence. It's a good beer, but not fantastic."
""
"Compared to Chimay Rouge, it's lacking, but decent and quite accessible."

"This Dubbel starts off with great poise. Lot of sugary fruit, sweet malts, yeast presence, but the finish just doesn't close the deal. It has a pure fruit tart character but the finish falls flat. That doesn't mean this isn't a solidly flavored Dubbel. I would buy a sixer of this for any occasion."
""
"O: Certainly not a confidence-builder for Grimbergen."
"poured into a massive half liter chalice, much to my surprise. looks glorious in its rightful glassware, very dark red t brown in color with a half inch of bone white lace on top. the glass is heavy and cold, and the beer inside of it is just delicious. the nose is dark fruits, molassas, and just enough alcohol. the taste is far more interesting, with the fruits and some candy sugar striking a nice note in the foregroud. spice and robust belgian yeast take the middle, while the residual sugar and cherry wine notes round out the finish. it has a really nice flow in that way. it does however lack some of the more subtle complexities of the best beers of this style, but that is not to its discredit. i find this a much more approachable and drinkable dubbel than many, as evidenced by how easily this half liter slid down. a little thin on the body for me, but that works fine with the gentle carbonation. its got a sliky smooth texture that i adore, and to me this is the best of the grimbergen beers. well worth it, espeicaly on tap."
""
"Overall, I think it's a great beer.... On Belgium standards; however, it's not up to par.... I love Belgian's, and this is one of my least favorite out of the Mecca."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - I think I liked the Grimbergen Blonde better. But this is a good option for someone to dabble in when trying Belgian styles. Makes a good transition to the style."

"This is a pretty simple dubbel. I like the clean presence on this one."

""
""
""
""
"Pours a clear, dark brown color. 2/3 inch head of an off-white color. Great retention and good lacing. Smells of sweet malt, slight pale malt, slight hop, slight yeast, and a hint of caramel malt. Fits the style of a Dubbel. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with a high carbonation level. Tastes of sweet malt, slight pale malt, slight yeast, and a hint of hop. Overall, good appearance and aroma, but body is a little weak, and the feel is too carbonated."
""
""
""
""
"O- Not in the same league as some of the better known Trappist and Abbey ales but was a pleasant accompaniment to a wood fired pork chop with grilled peaches and greens."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall not a bad beer but definitely not one of my favorite dubbels."
""
""
""
""
"D/O: This is good. I liked it, and would have it again. That said, 20 Liters is a lot... and I'm not sure if I would enjoy an entire keg of it. As I worked through the glass, the sweetness began to overwhelm the sourness, and what little bitterness exists on the back end is woefully inadequate to stand up to the other flavors here. In summary: Good, but not great."
""
"O- A well made enjoyable heavy malt beer. Though light enough to drink more than one."
"O: like a cousin to Gouden Carolus classic, this tasty dubbel goes down easy"
"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was the rich coloring. It initially appeared jet black, but as it warmed and when held to light, more maroon hues began to shine through. Otherwise, the tasting was overly sweet. With this style the sugars should come from the malts themselves and have a deeper, more serious cooked caramel flavoring. Here, the sweetness came from additive fruitiness which was overdone and overpowering."
""
""
""
""
"O: Rather dissapointing; all the flavours are there but too faint. Sorry."
""
"Food match: Desserts of course. And when it comes to desserts it's any man's (or woman's) game, however I think like for like something with macerated figs would go well."

"Unspectacular Belgian ale. Has some character and easy drinkability. 3.5"
"Pours a clear dark brown with a 1 inch foamy tan head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Foamy rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, brown sugar, spice, and some dark fruit aromas. Taste is of malt, dark fruit, and some more mild brown sugar and spice flavors on the finish. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer with a nice set or aromas and flavors. Quite tasty and drinkable."
""
""
""
""
"O: Good drinker, nice for the style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- this is a dubbel but screams winter to me, probably because of the ginger notes I picked up. I really enjoy the unique flavors here not found in every dubbel."
"Overall: This was a nice beer to have with my lunch. Easy to drink and enjoyable. I would have another."
""
"O-decent dubbel ale with good flavor,"
""
""
""
""

"Poured into a pint glass. Pours clear dark toffee brown with a light frothy tan head. The head dissipates slowly, leaving some lacy on the side of the glass. The aroma is of roasted malts, toffee, and dark fruits. It's the typical dubbel smell, but it is a bit faint compared to some others of the style. The taste is a nice blend of the smells. There are flavors of roasted malts and toffee. The dark fruit taste is there as well. It's definitely a bit bready from the malt. The alcohol is not strong in the flavor, but it should not be at only 6.5%. However, it definitely is there. An unfortunate problem with this beer is it a little watery. The body is light to medium and there is moderate carbonation. It's easy to drink. Overall, this is a good beer. It is not the greatest dubbel I've ever had, but it's certainly worth trying. It is a little sweet and easy to drink."
" O: Not terrible, but a hard category to be in. There are tons of better dubbels out there but this is definitely a solid entry. It is on the sweet side, but so are many dubbels."
"Overall: Quite sugary, quite fruity. It's OK."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This was a nice surprise that added to my love of Belgian ales."
"O- an ok Dubbel at a good price liked it on tap an easy drinker, but nothing outstanding"

"A nice dubbel, a bit tired this one though."
"o: very enjoyable, once i go for frequently, but like many Grimbergen beers, I find them a bit too sweet."
""
""
""
"I find myself liking dubbels more and more lately, mostly Americans, but it's good to be reminded where they originated, in beers like this one."
"I do think I have found a new favorite dubbel."
"Overall awesome beer"
""
""
""
""
""
"Notes: It's bready and nicely hearty. Cheers."
""
"Amber coloured with a one finger beige head, that goes slowly down, leaving heavy lacing around the glass. Smells lightly of carameland mostly of dark fruits, after trying hard enough I recognized fig,mostly. Taste is quite sweet but unfortunately metallic, although quite unique.Aftertaste is also sweet and the fig taste is even more obvious, along with some oplums maybe.Alcohol is not so traceable. Thin bodied and watery for for a dubbel, leaves some dryness on the palate. Good beer, but not as good as eny other average dubbel."
"3.5 D: Simple, but easy to drink beer."
""
""
"O- Great. Had this beer with a ruben sandwich. It was a wonderful experience."
""
""
"Overall: This is actually a very nice dubbel/double ale, whichever way you want to pronounce it. Very impressed and happy to have scored a bottle of this beer. The beer got better is it warmed up to room temperature."
""
""
""
"O - I'm not saying this is a bad beer, but I was definitely not satisfied with it either. I really like the Blonde, so I really thought this would be on par with it. There just didn't seem to be a much here to talk about. It was okay to try, but I doubt I'll be trying it again."
""
"overall - first time I had heard of this Belgian brewery, and I was very impressed."
"Overall not bad, it just seems to be lacking in complexity. Nothing here to drive me to want more."
""
""
"I found it to be medium bodied. Carbonation is on par, and the doesn't coat the tongue very much. The mild hops near the end leave a bitter finish."
""
""
""
""
"Not interesting."
""
""
"Overall: This is a pretty well put together beer. It is somewhat light for a full flavor beer but it is a beer which improves with the time you take to drink it. Hope you all enjoy and drink with pride."

""

"This Belgian pours red-brown--kind of raisin color with an off-white head that quickly diminishes to a thin skim. The aroma is quite malty, sweet raisin, caramel, and fig with fruity esters. The flavor is intensely malty, mainly raisin. The beer finishes dry and warm malts linger on the palate. The carbonation is medium-high and body medium-full. Overall a well-made flavorful beer, best after warming considerably, otherwise it is a bit one-dimensional a bit lacking."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I vaguely remember trying this well over a year ago, back in my NoVa days, but not enough to sate my curious brain. Better to have it possibly again, I always say. It pours a clear sunset russet topped by a finger of khaki foam. The nose comprises sweet caramel, brown sugar, light molasses, sweet figs, and maple syrup. The taste brings in more of the same, keeping that sweet-leaning course very tightly. Kind of odd that I don't get too much of the usual Belgian-ness on the tongue, but this lack doesn't hurt things very much at all. The body is a lithe medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a lightly grainy feel. Overall, a very nice dubbel, one of the sweeter ones I've ever had, but a generally enjoyable drink."

"A very good beer thats not overly heavy or sweet. It walks that fine line perfectly. I'd like to see some more of a foamy cap to pump up the appearance."
"I'm glad I had the Trappistes Rochefet 10 before writing this review. I will definitely drink this again but it is second to the Rochefet 10 at this point. Lots of fruity aromas but a little too thick and sweet. My favorite part is the chocolate covered cherry flavor. Carbonation was not as crisp as I would like, but it is a good Belgian Dubbel."
"Decent. Not the best, not the worst Dubbel."
"O: nice, sweet but not overly subtle or complex"
"The only problem with this great brew might be that there is too much going on. None of this is bad, and this is highly recommended, and I will buy it again."
"A deep ruby/brown beer with a modest opaque head on top. It smells of brandy, sherry, molasses and caramel. Dark fruits as well are present in the aroma-mellow but rich. A sip reveals sweet caramel malts, with a hint of that brandy/sherry like aroma coming through in the flavor. It has a pretty clean flavor for a dubbel, but with a tiny amount of sharp sourness, just a hint though. It balances out the sweetness of the malts nicely. It has a full, smooth body with moderate carbonation. Overall quite a pleasant beer, and a bit more straightforward than most dubbels I have tried. The alcohol is barely noticeable, which I consider a plus. Very nice, worth a try."
"The taste is roasted malts and belgian yeast. Sweet in the mouth. Delicious. Better in the taste than in the nose. So easy to drink. Almost light bodied."
"O - A decent double, one of the best from the supermarket."
"Overall it's OK for a pleasant beer, but seriously lacking as a dubbel. There's nothing unpleasant at all about it but not enough on the plus side to cause me to buy it again."
"O - A very clean and pleasant Dubbel, but not as complex and distinctive as the best examples. A good solid Belgian beer. I'm glad I can get it in the beer desert of Spain."
"Pours a brilliant brown. Malty nose. I found it refreshing that the typical smell of a Belgian hop strain didn't reach out and smack me in the nose. This one is definitely chock full of caramel, malt, and a tinge of smokiness. Goes down real smooth. Hope to see this again in the future."
"O: Found it quite appealing, esay to drink, nice flavors, and mouthfeel. A good dubbel at a good price."
"Drink- A pretty decent import to have at the pool in Laughlin. Needed a better glass. May have to have this one again."
"O - It was pretty good. I usually make a judgement call on the first smell, so my expectations dropped when I got a whiff. If anything, the beer is full of surprises, both good and bad."
"O - A pleasant treat. The moscato of beer, something you can probably serve to a non-beer fan and they'd probably enjoy it."
"Smell was the weakest point of this beer. It was typical steel barrel and that was it. Nothing else. Taste was very good. Spicy and bready while having a subtle cinnamon and banana taste. Mouthfeel was decent, but nothing special. Having never heard of this beer, I was pleasantly surprised after trying it at a local bar. I would definitely recommend this one."
"I tried this beer on tap on March 24, 2011 at ""The Town Crier"" in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The beer poured a translucent reddish-brown with a huge tan coloured head. The aroma was yeast, caramel malt, nuts, and fruit. The mouthfeel was medium bodied with medium carbonation. The flavour was sweet malt, yeast, and spices."
"feels foamy and thick in my mouth. Good body to it. Maybe a bit high on the carbonation. Very fun to drink and had alot of fun breaking this one down. Another great Belgian that I highly recommend."
"Overall: excellent craft brew to be enjoyed with a hearty meal. Good to drink casually but not for speed. Good taste and good beer."
"This is the sort of dubbel I like"
"Overall: Good beer"
"Pours brown, ruby hints in the light, fluffy white head, slightly sticky with some lace. Smell is dark fruit in alcohol, plum, raisin, cherry, light alc. and yeast. Taste is dark fruit, ripe cherry, yeasty, alc that comes and goes, brown sugar, plum and yeast. Mouthfeel is a little thin, medium carb and medium weight. Overall this isn't bad not stellar but can hold its own. The dark fruit character is quite nice here."
"A very good dubbel, definitely worth a try."
"A very elegant and complex Belgian ale, and a beer experience worth repeating."
"A refreshing and drinkable brew."
"O: Good balanced Dubbel, and quite a bit better than the bottle, from what I remember. Not too sweet, good dark fruit character."
"Roasted malt nose, with a subtle touch of green gooseberries still brings a bit of acidity, both in the nose or in the body. In the mouth, the body of the dress and the bitterness is balanced by a subtle fruity touch. The finish is bitter, not too exaggerated, with the presence of roasted malt and caramel."
"Dr: All in all, it's poorly priced by Ibiza standards, but I do suspect it's very fairly priced elsewhere, especially in Belgium. It doesn't hide its ABV well, but it's the best beer I've had on Ibiza so far (unless you count Guinness). Skip this one unless you're really into generic abbey beers that try to steal trappist marketing."
"Poured a 1.5"" head of irregular sized bubbles. Clear dark burnt umber brown color. Not much smell coming off it, just a hint of the hops. Flavor has a hint of raisins and caramel but really not a very powerful or complex taste. There's an acidic zing in a moderate finish. Well, it's drinkable, but this is a dubbel? Dubbel what?"
"Mouthfeel is sublime."
"The palate opens with a sharp sweetness with a blend of cherry and cola, along with a healthy dose of sugar. Moderately fruity in the mid-palate, there's some dried figs with a mild nutty bitterness present. The finish is a little disappointing with a fruity, cola-like character before fizzling out. As it warms up, there's some spice as well as a little bit of alcohol noticeable. The spice is kinda like Christmas spices, and a little bit goes a long way. Ultimately, this is decent, and on the sweeter end of the dubbel spectrum"
"Poured rootbeer brown with glistening red and gold. Decent head that didn't linger much. Fruity nose with alcohol evident. Tastes bubbly, yeasty and like dried figs and dates. Good vibrant carbonation, and not as creamy as some other dubbels. Dry finish. Very enjoyable."
"Let this beer warm up some. It wasn't until 2/3 of the way through did I realize how good this beer actually is."
"overall an ok example, definetly drinkable. Just nothing to write home about."
"The mouthfeel was medium bodied but it was rich and had plenty of carbonation."
"This one is better than most, particulary as an import."
"D - very glad to have this, will easily do in the 6 pack over the next couple days"
"D: Delicious, not world class, but quite good. Worth trying. I could have a few of these."
"Smoke. Very smooth mouthfull. It has the feel of cough mixture. Its a bit sticky so I wouldn't want too many, but overall a decent double."
"D: Despite its drawbacks, goes down nicely."
"On the palate, you get a a lot of deep rich malt notes that trend towards chocolate and perhaps a slight raisin note. The yeast flavors are evident, but not overwhelming. It has a thick mouthfeel with a lingering finish."
"D: A decent dubbel, but nothing to get too excited about."
"M/D Feels very smooth good carbonation and abv, pretty drinkable"
"D: This is a very nice sipping beer and nice example of the style."
"D-a bit too sweet, but still good, may try again as a desert beer"
"drinkability is awesome I could drink this all night it does not fill you up but is so complex with flavor it is now one of my new favorites and this bottle is going on my wall of greatness."
"D: Decent beer."
"Drinks well with nice sweet and mild toffe and chocolate notes, some hop dryness and some bread...a better than o.k. brew."
"I poured into a pint glass to two inches of beige head. It is copper colored. The aroma is sweet and spicy with plenty of caramel malt. The taste is sweet caramel and toffee malt with some mild spiciness. The mouthfeel has some moderate viscosity. A low amount of carbonation makes this a remarkably easy drinking beer."
"good but not great"
"Taste is fruity with an odd Smartees candy and Sour-Skittles sweetness that seems a bit out of place. Gives the mouthfeel the impression of being thin with the lack of a dense, caramel malt backbone that usually accompanies a dubbel. For me, this needs more malt, less fruit and a thicker body. I'll pass on this one next time."
"If you are thinking of trying it.. Don't hesitate."
"Pours a somewhat dark mahogany with a bit of an off white head and some pretty good lacing on the way down. Nose brings out some dark fruits, brown sugar, and toffee. Taste is some hints of fruit as well as a bit of sweet malt. Some Belgian yeast characteristics. Mouthfeel is medium and slightly creamy. Decent enough beer, but doesn't have the complexity of the better versions of this style."
"This beer has flavor and it really isn't an ""Avoid."" It's just not a very good Dubbel."
"On a recent trip to France I became quite acquainted with Grimbergen Blonde in the 50cl cans and found it to be a fairly sweet but overall enjoyable beer (sorry for the 5-second review). The dubble is in the same league again - quite nice in it's own way and certainly exuding a distinct personality. All in all a decent beer but overall it's not the best example of this style."
"jd"
"D - Pretty drinkable. Might get this again, although there are cheaper and better alternatives."
"Served on tap, and a bit too chilled, I believe. As far as Belgian brews go, the smell seemed hardly to reach my nose. The taste, though malty and smooth, suffered from an apparently lower level of complexity. Brown sugar and a decently-heavy maltiness were my predominant impressions. Again, I'm thinking that the over-chilling factor subdued a lot of potential in the flavor department. But big thumbs up on drinkability. I'd love to try it again, if not simply for drinkability, then in hopes of finding a greater complexity the second time around."
"Picked this up at the Supermercardo in Puerto de Santa Maria for about 1.6 Euros. Worth the drive and poor queuing. Poured into a Coors Banquet beer Pilsner glass and got a rich two inch white head which was surprising due to the tawny red colour of the ale. Nice Dubbel, nice taste, not too malty and worth a session of two or three. Enjoyed it with my stogie on a warm Spanish evening. Adios."
"Murky, dark amber, almost brown in body topped by large, frothy off white head. Fragrant aroma of alcohol, sweets, caramel, burnt sugar, prunes, dark fruit, slight raisin and kiwi, and some spice. Flavors of prunes, raisins, kiwi, sugars, sweets, slight candied apple towards the finish. Light, medium carb in body with a sour aftertaste. This is a fine beer and the flavors gradually become less irritating as you drink it but it is not one worth purchasing again."
"d- okay, this isn't a dubbel to write home about, but it's drinkable. belgians aren't my favorite style, and this one is just okay."
"D: An average dubbel, tastes a bit mass produced, for nuance and complexity look elsewhere."
"Drinkability - very drinkable, i'll give it another try"
"Taste was a mix of banana, clove, caramel, toffee. No hops, pretty much true to style. Don't go knockin' on Belgium's door lookin' for hops or bitterness. More alcohol than I would have preferred to taste. Finishes thin and hot. Not for hopheads."
"A good beer but a little lack-luster in terms of having dominant features for the nose and taste. I will most likely pick up another, from a different batch perhaps, some time in the future as a test."
"D: Despite the heavy flavors it is still pretty drinkable, although I would prefer maybe a slightly drier or hoppier finish to balance all of that toffee out. this would be a good beer to drink with apple pie or cake, or some sweet dessert."
"Pours a deep dark ruby brown with about a cm of creamy tan head that isn't going anywhere in a hurry. Smells of yeast, malt, some banana. The taste is actually very clean for a dubbel. There's a lot of malty sweetness and very little bitterness, but it finishes fairly cleanly. Mouthfeel is thick and creamy, very nice. Overall, one of the more drinkable dubbels I've had."
"D: Good. I personally like the Belgium Dubbel style and Grimbergen represents it very well. I really recommend it"
"D: The beer is relatively easy to drink but it doesn't have quite enough of a complex taste to leave me wanting to drink another."
"Drinkability: Superb. This is one of those ""I'm going to give myself a present"" brews. Very tasty stuff."
"Picked this one up at J Barleycorn in Nashville TN. Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, Grimbergen Double is a clear, ruby-amber color with a huge, thick creamy off-white head that leaves lots of chunky, sticky lacing. Must not be bottle conditioned as there is no apparent yeast to be found either in suspension or on the bottom of the bottle. The nose is very malt forward, toffee and caramel, a touch of dark fruitiness and yeasty phenols. The flavor echoes the nose with the fruitiness dominating more than I expected, some toffee, mild chocolate, anise and hints of alcohol. The mouthfeel is thinner than I had expected and with a beer as sweet as it is, I was surprised by the very dry finish. Overall, a drinkable beer, seems a little off-style but still very good."
"Actually pretty good. Not as good as many Trappist examples of the style but for a beer from a European macro brewery they have done a good job."
"D: This is pretty good but I'm not sure if I'd buy it on a regular basis."
"A solid beer, though I feel it would be much better out of the bottle with more carbonation to cut the sweetish finish."
"D-this is a great beer, a wonderful melding of malty goodness with an ever so light hop bitterning at the finish."
"While this is not the best, at $2 a bottle it is certainly an inexpensive dubbel fix if you're strapped for cash. I'll be sure to get another the next time I see one."
"D: Dangerously drinkable as a session beer"
"D: The mouthfeel of this beer is incredibly smooth and there is almost no hint of alcohol. Add to that the fact that this is a very complex beer, and it scores high on drinkablity."
"All in all, not a bad example of the style at all - I was hoping for a bit more flavor, as I've even had some domestic expressions that were superior..."
"Thick, viscous mouthfeel in the beginning gives way to a decidedly thinner body. Not very drinkable due to the intense sweetness and lack of carbonation and hop balance."
"Id have no problem throwing back a few of these."
"Overall, I'm diggin' this. No cloying sweet raisin and rubbing alcohol elements. Lower in alcohol so no real bite. You could put a couple of these down because of that fact alone. The dryness at the finish impedes the drinkability a bit, but not much. Try this -- still worth it."
"D: This beer is packed with flavor and highly drinkable. I picked this up as a single, but wish I had a few more. I'll definitely grab this one again."
"Notes: Overrated maybe because it is so common these days, at least in most common markets around Madrid. And yet it is a large scale Belgium dubbel that remains reliable and pretty solid despite its ubiquity. Again, maybe it´s nothing extraordinary but there are no complaints to having something like this handy next to some of the local swill."
"The second glass was better kinda like the more you drink it, the better it taste. Definitely will be visiting again."
"Grimbergen Dubbel pours a very dark amber color, with a moderate head. There didnt appear to be a very strong smell. It tasted rather heavy, not too hoppy and strong falvors, and an almost sweet taste as well. It was rather easy to drink, and there were no really strong aftertastes. Overall Grimbergen Dubbel is a pretty good beer, but not the best in this style."
"The problem is carbonation which is lacking. It's tough to glean everything, interpret on the palate without bubbles breaking it up. It's not too heavy, but it's mix of flavors is rather muddled."
"After having it a few times, this is becoming one of my favs that I know I'll keep going back to."
"Drank it during my dinner which was a good companion with the food. Enjoyed it!!"
"D: would be willing to drink these often they are also cheap when compared to other doubles. goes down smooth, but is also a bit lower abv than the norm."
"taste is of sweet toffee and chewy candy with some raisin like fruits to accompany it. then some sweet strawberry fondue chocolate goin' on there as well."
"Feel and Drinkability: Light on the palate with medium-low levels of fine carbonation. This beer is extremely easy to drink. Its aftertaste doesn't linger as long as I'd like but its a decent enough beer. Feels just a bit too light on the palate, a little to smooth and slick, too watery. More body would beneit this beer. More malt and a bit less sugar would give this beer a more interesting flavor and feel. Its still good, and I'll enjoy it and most likely but it again...I like this beer, but there are definitely better out there. Reasonably priced."
"It was very enjoyable and balanced, while not having any one flavor dominate like the malt. A very nice beer that's good, but not great."
"Grimbergen Dubbel has a medium to heavy body with moderate carbonation. The texture is a touch syrupy, but not too bad, overall I thought this was a pretty tasty dubbel, with the characteristics I would associate with this style, but the sort of ""fungusy", musty, damp basement character turned me off a bit."
"D - It is very palatable, but not exceptional in any way."
"D- This is a good beer. A little too sweet for me and I don't think I could have more than a couple. Good beer for someone to try out who wants to try dubbels."
"Unlike their blonde, I find this beer to be quite nice and would recommend it. A nice drink.."
"Serving type: bottle"
"Serving type: bottle"
"D: Very easy to drink, needs a touch more alcohol."
"Pours a crystal clear reddish brown with a small light brown head. Smell is of stale rusty malt, bad. Taste is better, dry caramel malt up front, with a pleasant grainy middle. Finish though is a touch sour and wierdly salty. Mouthfeel is watery, good carbonation though. Drinkability is good though, light and refreshing. The filtered aspect of this beer hurts it though, bottle conditioned for dubbles is best, IMO. Decent beer, but not that great of a dubbel overall."
"Drinkability> Can't get over the hang."
"This is a pretty pedestrian dubbel in my opinion. Just not very interesting, and on the watery side. I'm not a huge fan of dubbels to begin with, but this is not one I'd be likely to seek out again."
"This poured a dark brown (SRM30) with ruby highlights. A 1"" tan head was supported by moderate carbonation. Lacing was moderate and persistent. Aroma is sweet malt and brown sugar with a low level of banana. Flavor was sweet malt (brown sugar) low bitterness and low banana. Full mouth feel with a slightly cloying finish."
"The taste ts somewhat similar and richly malty, dryish, but tending slightly to the sweet side with faint hints of bitterness and tartness. It has fermented fruit (apple, plums) along lightly sweet, sour and tart fruit (plums and cherries). There is a vague, generally dark, caramelised grain-burnt-sugar maltiness with the fruit, along with some iron and leafy hop. It starts off heading to the sweet side but, just before it truly becomes sweet, it finishes dry with light fruity tartness and light leafy bitterness just barely balanacing out the sweetness. It's fairly complex, quite enjoyable, and satisfying, if threatening to be too sweet. The feel is excellent, light and lively but with a hint of oiliness."
"Mildly bitter, and almost to the point of being sweet but never quite getting there, it's very easy to drink. It's rich in the mouth and velvety soft. The alcohol never shows. It's fairly flavorful, yet it somehow lacks character. It's subdued, not bold, and none of it components really stand out on their own. So in a way, it's good, yes, as it's perfectly rounded and balanced. But in another way that leaves it lacking because there's nothing really going on."
"Overall it's a decent brew. Very middle of the road, you can't go too far wrong with it, but the scenery isn't spectacular either."
"Overal a decent brew, aside from the overly sweet flavors it is good in all other aspects."
"Serving type: 25 cl. brown glass bottle"
"D-It's pretty tasty, though maybe not as full in flavor and feel as many dubbles."
"Overall - Outstanding ale! Complex and satisfying from start to finish."
"Drinkability and Notes: I mean, its an easy beer to drink. Is it enjoyable?....well again, it doesn't taste bad, but it's nothing really special. If you're looking for a middle-of-the-road benchmark, here you go."
"D- good but not great. little too watery and flat for me. lot of belgians out there with a better flavor profile."
"T- Rich taste. Kind of spicy with a hint of chocolate to it. Malty, almost too bold for my likes. It's quality, but there's just too much going on with this beer."
"D: Way too sweet for my liking to be honest. Appearance is good and everything else. But the taste not as balanced as I would prefer."
"It doesnt make such a big difference for drin kability though and mouthfeel is pretty good so yes i d have it again"
"Not a bad beer by any means. Would be a nice introduction into Belgians, though doesn't seem as deep as others I've had. Good, though."
"Medium bodied with a smooth mouthfeel. Overall this just isn't one of the most appealing dubbels out there. Decent to try but there are better options that are more complex and not as much of that cloying sweetness in the finish."
"In summary, I would definitely drink this beer again. However, I think there are other options that have a bit more flavor or characteristics that set them apart. This beer is well done, but doesn't really stand out."
"Drinkability: Looked great and smelled decent, but it just doesnt taste good-- at all. I would say I want to wash my mouth out, but like I said, the aftertaste is ok. I wont get this again."
"Nice blend of sweet (malt sugar) and bitter (hop). Surprisingly thin for this style of beer. Bitter finish with that pesky metal taste showing up in the aftertaste."
"Looks great after the pour - dark mahogany with an good off white head that quickly recedes to a thin covering. Smell dried dark fruit - cherries, plums. Taste is fairly sweet, no hops and a pretty linear malt sweetness throughout with a balanced sweet and slightly bitter finish. Decent mouthfeel, a little thin but good carbonation. Very drinkable beer."
"Drinkbility: Very nice beer... not too high in abv... refreshing and robust at the same time... I'll seek this one out again...."
"pours out a dark chocolate amber with a light beige head. decent aroma of prunes, raisins, and light fruitiness. taste is similar to smell, but lacks definition in flavors like other dubbels i've had. decent mouthfeel if a little watery. medium to ok beer"
"Not worth it for half the price."
"Bought a single of this for around $2. Pours a deep red/ruby color with ton of head to it and lots of lacing. Smell is of some dark fruits (get some raisin, plum, dates in there), taste is very smooth upfront. The dark fruit taste kind of disappears but I was amazed at the smoothness of this beer. Pretty good mouthfeel, but I feel it's lacking a bit on overall flavor. Looks good and is smooth, but when you swallow you don't get that ""ahh that tastes delicious"" feeling. I'm not the biggest fan of Belgians but this one was solid.. no more no less."
"This beer pours a brown color with ruby hues. The head is a billowy cloud of off white foam. It recedes very slowly into chunky lacing. The aroma is of dates, plums figs, and hints of anise. It is rather strong too. The taste is full of Belgian malt, dates, plums, but without the nice anise notes of the aroma. The mouthfeel is medium-full bodied with appropriate carbonation, and a velvety texture. Overall, this is a really nice dubbel, and at a great price ($1.89 for a 11.2oz bottle). I wouldn't hesitate to drink this beer again."
"D- great brew, much better than the first time i had it about a year ago. i especially didn't remember the lactic aroma. the MF lacks just a little in the sensation but as often times before, this enhances D for me, and the way this baby finishes, so clean and fresh, she's a skyrocket, alright."
"Overall, a definite enjoyment. No presence of alcohol makes this beer very easy to drink. I can definitely enjoy a few of these in a night."
"Very enjoyable and would definitely drink again, but would not want this rich beer to be my regular."
"overall not that great for a abbey dubble, i like this style but this one just doesn't hit the mark."
"Drinks easy, fairly sessionable."
"Drinks really easy for the style, but lacks some complexity which I need to satisfy my expectations. Not a bad training wheels dubbel"
"While I would generally consider something like this an unexceptional beer, that the balance its flavors strike and the immense drinkability grant it a huge thumbs up from me."
"Hint of tartness in the finish. Beer is light bodied bordering thin. It's drinkable but not something I would seek out again."
"Drinkability: I would have another couple of these. This beer has the most pronounced pear taste I think I have ever had. Good and smooth--but not excellent."
""
"Future outlook: Not the most complex Belgian beer I've sampled, but still tasty and refreshing. Would actually be quite sessionable. I'd be happy to have this again."
"Having just recently enjoyed this on tap for the first time I was happy to try the bottled version thanks to neighbor Tom. A clear but dark carmel color with a fair light tan colored head and very generous lacing. The aroma is tart malt and clove, smooth and grainy, nice. The flavor brings that slightly bubblegummy mix with caramel malt sweetness. Very fine carbonation but it delivers a stiff bite while holding the root beer licorice character. Refreshing and crisp, a bit aqueous, a reasonable drinker. It has a clean grape flavored overtone. Pretty enjoyable stuff."
"Good beer, drinkable. The flavor isn't as rich as some dubbels, but everything there is well balanced."
"The aroma was there, the flavor was there, just neither in the degree that would make me really seek it out again. I wouldn't turn it away by any means, but there are others out there that are deeper."
"As far as the style goes, I'd have to say that this is not a highly drinkable brew. If you're not put-off by the fact that it's not very dubbel-like, it's actually pretty good."
"OVERALL: An enjoyable beer I'd definitely have again. The palate could be improved, which would improve the overall taste and drinkability of the beer. However, this was definitely an enjoyable brew I'll be re-visiting again."
"Drinkability is decent."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, good kick, good representation of style, it's a nice Belgian beer to drink for a while but there are others in the style that I would choose first."
"The finish is sweet and slightly candied. I do like the rings on the side of the glass left behind by the head. All in all not a bad beer but not a fantastic one."
"Excellent drinkability; not too high in alcohol and flavor aren't cloying. I could drink this one all night."
"NOTES: BBCSD-0901-Sean"
"Dark reddish color, huge head. Smell is pretty subtle, of sweet malts. Taste, sweet, and little metallic for the frist 3 sips..but went away, as it warms it definitely gets better. Not too bad, has that favor in the finish that is in pranqster, and i dont know what it is, but its nice...i could drink 2, probably not more though., and dont really think i would want to...."
"Thanks, khiasmus, for this big gem in a little bottle."
"D 4.0 - very drinkable dubbel ale, less intense fruity notes than some others, not to rich like some, less complex than other dubbels. A sweeter sugary dubbel for sure."
"This dark brown colored ale pours with a very large light tan foam that lasts well in the glass. Unfortunately, this Belgian ale is not bottle conditioned. Very light notes of hop and dark fruit are present in the nose. Flavors are very muddled and muted, not helped by the watery texture due to the lack of natural carbonation. Not an awful beer."
"I can't believe this one only averages a B+! The nose and taste are of plum, grape, apple and brandy. Mouthfeel isn't great, but who cares? I'm really impressed with this beer. It's so fruity and sweet. So what if it's ""simple""? It's accessible and delicious to both the well-experienced and uninitiated alike."
"definately will have again when i get the chance."
"12 ounce bottle from Eddie's Liquor right down the street from my house along with the Blonde, hard to believe this is lower in alcohol than the blonde but that was more of a tripel anyways, consumed both on 2/4/08, reviewed from notes, poured into my Grimbergen goblet, color is a mix between a dark red and medium brown, thin 1/2 inch creamy beige head, decent retention, not much lacing, smell had toffee, milk chocolate, light bubble gum, brandy, Belgian yeast, and berries, taste starts off with some toffee, more malt in the middle, mostly caramel, finish is slightly dry but has a chocolate bite, gets more sweet as time goes on and it warms, mouthfeel is both sweet and chewy but pretty weak, moderate level of carbonation, medium bodied, taste does not last, could drink a few of these, could get heavy and sweet after some time, better than the Blonde from this brewery but still not great, worth trying"
"Overall a decent dubbel. Not my favorite but still quality."
"Salud!"
"I was pleasantly surprised. This isn't a beer I would drink more than one or two of, but with a meal it is fantastic."
"If you love the traditional Belgium Dubbel, you will certainly love this. It smells of maltiness and dry fruit. Entry is sweet, followed by a bouque of sour apple, pear, and sweet grain. Finish is complex, with some sweet and dry notes of the fruit and malt tingling the tongue. I could drink a six-pack of this tonight... in fact, I might...."
"Very flavorful, each time I drink it I feel like I can taste something else in there. Not too sweet though, just a hint of the flavor - raisens, chocolate... A dark Belgian Ale, it is actually somewhat light tasting (in a good way depending on your mood)."
"D - I'm having trouble finishing this one. I can't imagine wanting another. Maybe it's the style that I don't like, but I found this fairly disgusting."
"I didn't know what to expect, but wouldn't search it out with better beers available."
"Overall: I've only had a few Belgian doubles but the ones I have tried are actual Belgians, not Belgian style, so I have to imagine they are pretty true to form. It's hard to recall the ones I've had before but I think I can safely say that this is my favorite Belgian double so far."
"D: I learned a lesson about assuming all things Belgian are going to be good. After polishing off the six pack, I read up on the brewery and larger owners. I'm inclinded to think this is safe take on the style. Nothing bad about it but would not try again."
"D: This was a very nice Dubbel...easily enjoy again."
"D: This is a brew I could sip on all night or used to follow a light meal. Very drinkable."
"Drinkability: This is a pretty enjoyable Dubbel, and at 6.50, you won't go wrong with these in 6 pack form. Def. a beer I would come back to."
"Overall, if I could find this bottled for less than the standard going rate of Belgian imports I'd buy it regularly. One of my favorites, especially for the style."
"I've also tried 3 of the 7 Trappist beers and they have helped ruin me to all other main stream Belgium beers."
"pours dark like a cola with small head and lace. smell is quick fruity and nice malt sweetness. beligan sugar release come complex qualities. taste is first rust. then it opens up a bit to some sugars but not as interesting as the odor. not hoppy but metalic nature takes from the malty fruity. not too creamy. some nice texture but nothing to substancial. had it on tap... and i don't usually seems to think so but much much better."
"I wonder if I just got a bad bottle or something... but this just isn't a good beer on the initial pour."
"There be Piraats after that beer"
"D: I could definitely sit down and have a couple of these. I wish the carbonation was pulled back just a tad. All in all, a pretty good dubble out of the bottle but if you can get it on tap its much better."
"Very little head when poured, and light brown in color. Second bottle was poured more vigorously and the head that developed was lost quickly. Smelled faintly sweet, with no one scent striking me right away. After a couple sips some fruits were picked up like figs and courants. Seemed a little too carbonated and would have been more drinkable if it went down smoother. Very decent but does not stand out like other Belgian dubbels that I have tried."
"D: A moderately good, clean double though lacked in character and flavor. Not bad, just nothing that really distinguish itself or warrants calling it good. Average."
"D Very good. In fact, this beer is pretty much ideal for drinkability due to its Smooothness."
"D= My first truly disappointing ale in this style from Belgium. Not terrible, but nothing to write home about either. I could take it or leave it."
"Bottle: Poured a deep brown color ale with a light off-white head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma consists of candi sugar with some deep Belgian sweet malt. Taste is a well balance mix between some candi sugar and some semi-sweet Belgian malt. Body is quite full for the style with some good carbonation and no apparent alcohol. This one may be lacking some complexity (dry fruits for example) but still a very good and solid example for the style."
"Pours a ruby brown in color. Decent amount of pillowy head. Decent carbonation. I'm usually not a big fan of Dubbels, but this had more flavors that I do like. There was a definite toffee flavor, as well as a very nice dark fruit appearing as well. Which I didn't mind at all. Good beer."
"D: not too high on the alcohol but it definately is strong, yet I think quite drinkable."
"taste is definitely a bit fruity. the taste spreads throughout the entire mouth, the taste goes away pretty quickly. there is some roasted malts. at the end the taste goes a bit flat (if that makes sense)."
"Iced-tea colored with a light tan head that sticks around for a while. Very fruity aroma with some toastiness evident before even tasting the beer. Peaches and plenty of malt in the taste, even a bit sugary but not so much that it's a turn-off. I'd prefer a bit more carbonation. This was a chance purchase from the Pioneer Market in Manhattan, and worth another try."
"Drinkability: Not the best dubbel but certainly has its charms"
"This was a very unique but very nice brew. Poured a dark red brown body color with a nice one finger tan head. Smell is malty with a fair amount of sweet notes. IT has a smooth mouthfeel and very malty but crisp and sweet taste. I greatly enjoyed this beer and it had nearly no strong after taste whatsoever. It is very drinkable but it is rather strong so not completely appealing to everyone's tongue"
"Nice dark amber brown color with a good thick tan head and lots of lacing. Aroma is medium with hints of dark fruits, chocolate, and some roasted sweetness. Mouthfeel is decent, but the flavor is a little off. Sweet and somewhat fruity it's nice at first but there is a strange metallic like aftertaste that really puts this one off. Decent but I'm not very impressed."
"Poured a deep redish brown, very clear, with a sturdy tan head that left medium lacing. Smell is sharp and pungent, sour rasin and bitter orange with a liquer-like power. Taste is surprisingly smooth, chewy in the mouth, mince-pie with touch of dark chocolate. Substantial."
"D: I have had worse dubbels, but most of them have been American micro attempts. I would not pick this one again."
"Mouth is medium and crisp, for a belgian I don't feel that this is a ""double"" ale, I've had dubbels that have ten times more flavor and balance. then again I also drank a Rochefort 10 this evening, might be skewed a bit, just a bit"
"The complexity of this beer develops dramatically as it warms and is worth the wait."
"Taste-wise, the profound cherry caramel taste blends well with an alcohol taste. medium to full bodied and well carbonated."
"D-Not my favorite Belgium but one i would have again im sure"
"D. Extremely drinkable and well worth a try."
"Overall, this brew is good. Nothing amazing or mind blowing but still pretty good. Give it a shot!"
"Overall a little too sweet for my tastebuds. I've had other dubbels that I like a lot more."
"Overall, this is a nice dubbel. Great flavor and nicely drinkable. I've had it before, but it seemed even better this time around."
"Beautiful burgundy colour, no head, in fact the snifter sized glass was filled to the brim!!! Confusing aroma, smelled lots going on. Palatte pleasing coffee overtones was evident. The smooth finish was left with a hint of brandy. Very easy drinkability! This is one of the finest dubbels I have yet tasted and would definitely repeat"
"Pours a lovely brown/ruby color with a soft head that has great staying power, fed by decent carbonation. Smell is kind of tame, standard yeasty, maltiness is all I can muster. Toffee notes mingle with a malty backbone, touch of light noble hops balances things out well. Not too complex in the taste department. Light-medium mouth feel. Aftertaste is of a mild sweet breadiness. Better than good but not fantastic."
"drinkability is great. this is a wonderfully proportioned brew with solid malt and fruit presence and a light sweetness that ties the profile together. cheers!"
"Thick and creamy in the mouth, goes down smooth."
"This one's been calling my name from the shelf for quite a while. Figured it was time to check it out. Pours a dark burgundy into a goblet. A one-fingered bubbly tan head recedes at a decent pace leaving a thick and consistent lacing behind. Aromas of raisins, dates, dark chocolates and malts arise to the nose. Tastes of malts, a bit of yeast, some grape juice, some very slight hop bitterness, some spice, sugary sweetness and a furtive hit of alcohol heat in the end. What we have here is a good medium bodied sipper that should not be overlooked."
"Notes: Something I will try again and a brew almost like a fruit beer. A good beer and worth the try. This is not too complex,but it is a good beer for sessions."
"d too many others out there, but it was nice to try"
"Had this on tap in New Orleans at a bar called BeerFest. Poured a deep brown with ruby highlights. Aroma is of dark fruit and caramel. Flavor is the same with hints also of chocolate and toffee. Mouthfeel is very good. Drinkability is pretty high on this one as well. Good stuff."
"D - Easily drinkable and a very nice example of the style. The yeast notes are a bit flat, but the malt profile is excellent and the dry finish makes it easy to put down."
"D: Not too complex, but great taste, sits well and I could enjoy multiples."
"Very dark color, could be mistaken for a root beer. There was a constant stream of bubbles in the glass, similar to champagne. Yet there was almost no froth at the head. The scent is sweet and fruity with a hint of citrus. The mouthfeel is creamy with layered fruit, bread and spicy flavors. The finish is sweet and the aftertaste is rather grassy and a bit oily. Highly drinkable."
"Overall - Goes well with a meaty dinner, perhaps a light red wine substitute. A good intro to Belgian Abbey style ales for the beginner. The fruitiness may not be loved by all, but I thought this was a worthy buy. A great fruity flavor with a kick!"
"Drinkability is good, not sure I would want more than one at a sitting but I really enjoyed trying this beer. I would definitely revisit this one."
"medium carbonation, very thick nice mouthfeel, leaves mouth tasting very pleasant and ready for the next mouthfull."
"D-I used to drink this in France along with some other varieties from this Abbey, and it's nice to finally rate it. I don't recall so much buttery caramel in the finish. Overall, it's a good double, but not a favorite, and it's sweetness approaches the point of being cloying."
"The worst Dubbel I've had? Most likely. I've had this beer on tap many times and it has been OK, or at least I thought it was. Sat in the sun on holiday everything seems good and enjoyable, sadly this beer doesn't remind me of those balmy days of summers gone by."
"First Grimbergen I've sampled hopefully not the last . . Pours a nice clear dark brown . Not cloudy, no evidence of yeast in bottle. Nice white head , one finger with a vigerous pour. Robust smell of malt and slight fruit. Taste was nice and malty the way a dubble should be, minimal hops, nutty , sweet , but not cloyingly so. Very smooth dry finish very very drinkable. Price was a bit steep at 10 bucks a sixer but throughly enjoyable."
"Poured very dark with little head. It smelled very good, like a sweet bouquet of earthy fruits, with grapes sticking out a lot. It tasted similar to its smell, again with a sweet taste and grapes sticking out to me. The taste was a little weaker than some of the other dubbel's I have tried, however this was a very good beer. For its price, I will definitely buy without hesitation again."
"I had this on-draft at The Bulldog in New Orleans."
"Bottle bought from Park Slope Food Coop. Poured a dark ruby color with a thin off white head. Smell? Malt? Maybe. Taste like a duble, strong alcohol flavor. Smooth, a bit fizzzy, mouthfeel. Average drinkability. I've had it on tap and enjoyed it much better."
"M- I love it, heavy, lingering, but not intrusive, very drinkable, as far as dubbels are concerned."
"pleasant and easy drinking."
"Drinkability is high. I could session this or mix it with any number of foods, definately something to get more of."
"D- This was definitely an awesome beer. I would love to enjoy this with a nice steak. Could easily drink a few of these as the ABV is managable."
"I love this beer. Take it out of the fridge and let it sit for 20 minutes before drinking."
"D - Keep them coming, excellent drinking beer"
"The last time I tried this was at a Belgian beer restaurant in downtown Melbourne, Australia. Have seen it around at plenty of places in the states, but just haven't picked it up until now. Great deal by the way at just over ten dollars for a six pack. Pours a rosewood color, with a pillowed white head that lasts. Garnets of a raspberry color are all over the place with this one. Droopy dark fruits dominate the smell. Strawberry, plum, cherry and other berries come to mind. Taste is exceedingly sweet and complex, starting off rather sugary sweet, and then ending on a vinous fruit note. Mouthfeel is ligh to medium. Drinking this one is a breeze, as the alcohol is somewhat low for this style. It more than makes up for it in flavor. All in all I would say that this is a very flamboyant dubbel. Huge on sweetness, with little cuts of complexity here and there. I tend to pair most dubbels with rare red meat, but with this one dessert was the only way to go. The combination of this with a raspberry turnover and vanilla ice cream was delicious. Recommended."
"D: Good example of the style; although at 6.5% it is towards the low end of the ABV for this style. No dubbel is excessively drinkable but one or 2 glasses of this dubbel delivers a rich & satiating experience."
"d- you can't taste the 6.5% so thats good, but over all it was cloying, and I wouldn't have more than one."
"I had two for the evening. Sadly the second one was served in a standard pint glass. It looked like they were out of clean goblets, so it wasn't worth making a scene."
"Had this on tap in a Grimbergen chalice. Deep ruby read color with a chunky two-finger white head that left a great deal of lacing. Most impressive. Smell is a bit faint, but very inviting. A nice mixture of dark fruits like figs, raisins, plums, and black cherries on top of sweet bread. Taste is much more robust. Very sweet, indeed. A bit spicy too. Very pleasant. Mouthfeel is creamy, but thin. Not bad at all. Oddly enough, it paired extremely well with the sushi I was eating."
"Mouthfeel was quite bubbly and active but never overpowering. I enjoyed the consistent mouthfeel of this beer. Very easy to drink and I will be getting this again when I hit my local shop again. Recommended for those that like this style and prefer a beer to be on the sweeter side of the flavor spectrum."
"Not a great example of the style IMO, but an interesting beer to try nonetheless."
"Don't expect much, and you wont be disappointed."
"D - Couldn't drink many, but would enjoy with dessert. 11.2 is the perfect serving of this beer."
"D= Not a bad drinking beer, I had one before dinner and another with dinner. It wasn't a perfect match with the Schnitzel ala Holstein."
"Tried Grimbergen Blonde and really liked it... had high hopes for there Dubbel... Copped a single botle from Gary's in Madison... Appearance very much fits the Dubbel compositon... dark, ruby-red, brown, with impressive foamy head that lingered for a bit... smell is full of figs and slight alcohol, which is also detected in the taste although the 6.5% ABV isn't that high... taste was full of prune, figs, and rum flavors... candied, with brown sugar notes bursting through... very thick and rich flavor with an equally powerful mouthfeel... drinkable was good due to the rich but not overbearing or cloying flavor and the relatively low alcohol percentage... a top-notch brew for sure... great depiction of the style and definitely recommended..."
"Brew poured to a brown color, with some orange and red highlights. Nice sized tan head that has pretty good retention and leaves a nice amount of lacing. The aromas show off a nice sweet malt smell mixed with fruit, mostly cherry along with a grape like scent that seem to lend itself to a slight sour property. The flavor is nice, similar to the aroma but the fruit comes out much more. Noticeable (not dominant in any way) grape like taste mixed with raisin and a slight tart cherry flavor. Brew seems to be all over the place but still has an interesting flavor. Slightly more alcohol flavors come out as it warms. Pretty good brew, not sure if I would run out and get this one again but still it is not bad."
"pours a dark amber with hints of bright ruby and a very large four finger beige head that settles to a rocky frothy two fingers leaving a light lace and chunks of froth on the glass. aromas of sweet sugar with a hint of spice. very sweet taste, with rock candy or dark brown sugar and sweet caramel and hint of raisin. medium bodied with a slightly slick mouthfeel and carbonation is very good. a little to sweet for a session beer but as a dessert beer its very good."
"A nice beer. I'm not sure how many I could drink due to the sweetness but it's a good beer nonetheless."
"D- Very easy to drink. Have had more complex dubbels, but would definitely buy again."
"D= very drinkable, so long as you are enjoying this particular style."
"Overall: A nice drinkable dubble. Malt and Yeast aroma and flavors spot on. I thought the mouthfeel was a little thin and it was too aggressive on the carbonation. It also lacked the ""wow"" factor, but none the less it was nice to drink."
"Pours a clouded ruby brown with minimal tan head. Nose is sugary, cherry, with a touch of wood. Flavor is smooth with a touch of wood somewhere in there and a slight bit of caramelized sugar. Feel is great. Nice effervescence and bubbly on the tongue. Drinkable, yes. Quite good and worth going to...maybe worth going to again."
"Smooth, smooth, smooth. Like drinking liquified chocolate, without the over powering sweet sugar. Mouthfeel is moderate, with carbonation nearly non-existent. I need a fresher bottle tomorrow to test against this one."
"Another average Grimbergen made for the masses and far from the best beers of the style. Or for that matter, of any style Grimbergen makes."
"Drinkability: This is easy to drink, a nice after dinner beer. It is a very solid Belgian double, however there are quite a few better ones out there."
"Pours a dark ruby brown color with an average egg shell colored head that left some lacing on the glass. The smell is of Belgian candi sugar and dark cherries, has a musty aroma to it as well. The taste starts of metallic and sweet with a dark cherry or raspberry flavor. The malt is quite neutral in this brew and no real hop presence detected. The feel is much lighter than I expected, not water but light, the carbonation is borders on the soft side and it finishes sweet but not sticky. A lighter dubbel than others and has an odd metallic twang but it is rather easy to drink and no cloying flavors."
"Notes - I wasn't expecting much from this, but it's surprisingly decent and characterful."
"D: Not had - I'd happily knock back a few of these. It's quite light for its strength (as are most of the Belgian beers which use sugar in their recipes). Not a favourite, but pleasant enough."
"A great Dubbel all around. Great to see something that is available on-tap, as well as in bottle form, that tastes great and won;t break the bank like some other imports. Definitely recommended."
"After my sample of Maredsous 10, I was surprised that this beer tasted quite ""light", if only because i was expecting something heavy. Highly drinkable and full of dark fruity flavors. Too bad it's served in smaller goblets : ("
"Review translated from french 5-24-2008."
"this was one my dads favs in the 70's, i don't think it's brewed by the same people, though ; pours a clear, deep reddish-brown w/ a thin off-white head which dissipates quickly, huh, no yeast in the bottom of the bottle, moderate broken lacing ; a sweet, fruity, caramelized aroma, dates maybe, a hint of butter(?) maybe ; a crisp, sweet, brandyish, flavor w/ a slight metallic taste, some fruity undertones, a little watered down tasting, actually, not a really noteworthy Belgian dubbel, definitely not the Grimbergen I remember ; a little on the lighter-bodied side,too, but the co2 helps cover that ; a drinkable one, but i put this one on the bottom of my style list, so far..."
"d: Very drinkable for a dubbel. Not too malty or sweet. Not too pricey, a good, easily accessible belgian."
"Looks beautiful in the glass, with rich crystalline red color and a nice head. Not much aroma. A good amount of nice dried fruit notes, with more of a brandy-ish quality coming through as I got further into the glass. More dried fruit in the finish, particularly some cherry and prune notes. I would've guessed this had more alcohol. Surprisingly clean finish for such a sweet beer, but still a little cloying by the end of the glass. Still, overall an above-average dubbel."
"A tasty beer, with a fair bit going on, all be it in an almost behind the scenes way. Some residual sweetness, assuming its from dark candi sugar, but very well attenuated, almost managing a dry finish, making for a very drinkable ale, it would be no chore to knock a few of these back. Would serve as a good, approachable Belgian/Dubbel. Thanks to my wife Nicci for picking this up for me."
"An enjoyable Belgian double."
"Overall: in my opinion the best Grimbergen in the market. Very nice body and perfect level of sweetness. Looking forward for another one."
"Drinkibility is much greater than most Belgian dubbels. I could drink three to four of these, where normally I would limit it to one or two."
"I think this is an underrated dubbel, especially for its price. I found very little to criticize to tell the truth. Not world class, but a very solid representation of a Belgian that is highly enjoyable -- and very accessible to friends who you may be trying to turn onto beers that they may otherwise find daunting. I'll be getting this again."
"Solid but ultimately underwhelming. A clean tasting dubbel but just a little bit low on flavour and overall character"
"A bit dark, not too sweet. Pomegrant juice. A bit of head on darkish brown. Malty yeasty aroma. Balanced bit nothing too special. A bit raisin wine sourish and bitter amidst yeast. Drinkable brew but So-so for a Belg. Carmel and a touch of toastiness."
"A very good brew, and one of the first Dubbel's I've tried. I enjoy this style, and will look for more."
"Pours a nice medium brown color with a decent sized head that fades into a nice thin layer on top of the brew. The smell as the head retreats is a nice fruity blend of raisin, apple, and a hint of caramel. The taste is fairly sweet but nowhere near overwhelming, with a slightly bitter undertone that tames the fruit. Flows smoothly through the mouth, leaving a clean and film-less feeling. Very tasty but a little on the sweet side to have too many in one sitting. A great beer."
"Pours dark brown with some nice, clear ruby highlights and a pale tan head that fades to a ring. Nicely balanced aroma of dark fruits, baked apples and an earthy hint that reminds me of cigar tobacco. Some nice doughy/yeasty notes in there, too. On the palate, things are a tad too sweet, but still dry overall. Light raisins and rum coexist with some band-aid elements and baked apple spices. Licorice on the finish. Mouthfeel is pretty light for a dubbel and quite well carbonated for the style, but not over the top. Overall, this is a nice little dubbel, especially for the price. Quite decent."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, sweet up front, along with yeasty, doughy goodness. Raisins and caramel duke it out to the finish."
"I'm tempted to bump the flavor score because the beer really does nothing wrong. Trouble is, it does almost nothing right. Not all Belgian beer is special, even for a converted Belgianophile like me. Grimbergen Dubbel is exhibit 'A'."
"Pours a four finger light tan, rocky head that fades slowly to a thin layer leaving some lace. Nice deep, clear amber color. Medium carbonation and medium bodied. Caramel/plum nose. Flavor is sweet-balanced nutty caramel, clean finish. Better than on tap in Belgium! $1.50 for a 330ml bottle from Capitol Convenience Concord, NH."
"Tasty brew, i don't drink many dubbels but that may change soon."
"Cheers!"
"Glad to have tried this as I work through various examples of belgian brews."
"D- Decent, drinkable dubbel. Will probably get this one again."
"Yeasty and full, plenty of dark sugary malt and minimal hop balance. Nutty and pleasant, but nothing to write home about. I wouldn't go out of my way to recommend it, without the stigma of the dubbel it's an okay Belgian dark."
"Poured into a Grimbergen chalice a nice dark brown and a light tan tan that left a good lacing on the glass. Very small aromas of sweet coffee. It had a good sweet taste with hints of caramel, coffee, and slight dark fruit. It is a tasty beverage that is very non offending."
"I like the color and appearance of this beer. The nose (smell) isn't that pronounced - there's nothing bad, but its just not particularly strong, either - kind of bland in the smell department. The taste is good, though a bit sweeter than the typical dubbel if you ask me. Mouthfeel is good. I dinged it a bit on drinkability, because of the sweetness - the sweetness makes it hard to have several of them..."
"Aroma from the beer was definitely the highlight. A fairly decent dubbel but there are definitely better around."
"This pours a dark ruby color with a decent off-white head. It is a bit light for a dubbel There was a rich sweet malty aroma full of dark fruits. The flavor is equally rich with good malt and the same dark fruits. The after taste has some sweet toffee in it. This beer has fairly high carbonation so it accentuates the flavors and tickles my tongue. It has a medium body which is perfect for a dubbel. The drinkability is really good on this. This might become a standard for me."
"Pours a deep translucent mahogany, almost cola but redder in color. Short, creamy head tuirns into consistent lacing throughout. Whiffs of yeastiness and fermented fruits abound. Taste is very subtle, I was expecting more intense flavors from this, but still was enjoyable. Heavy yeasts are well balanced with strong malts and a slight sweetness is present from the fermented fruits. Towards the end of the glass, though, the flavors start to falter in balance and the alcohols and rotting fruit flavors are more prevalent. Altogether, a pretty drinkable dubbel, I'd say almost a session dubbel."
"Grinbergen Dubbel pours a clear deep ruby red, almost brown. The head is thick and sticky and follows my sips on the way down the glass. Aroma is caramel malts, yeast and some darks fruits. Flavor is rich sweet raisiny malts, dark fruits and a nice rounded yeastiness. Very little alcohol flavor, but just a bit in the finish."
"Drinkability: This one has a lot of complex flavors but just didnt seem to balance well (all over the place). This was a good but not great beer."
"Overall impression: A dry, spicy, well-knit Abbey ale. Nothing off but nothing ""wow"" either. A solid offering."
"Poured this beer from bottle to a 50 degree tumbler. The beer had a nice mahogany color with a big fat tan head that smelled a little like caramel. bready but like sour dough bread that went SOUR. The word yuk comes to mind and I poured this beer out. If you like sour beer go for it. I will not buy again."
"Pours a dark burgandy with a frothy white head with heavy lacing. The smell is sweet with some yeast and fruit notes. The taste was sweet with the yeast, fruit, and a toffee flavor showing through. This one has a medium body with good carbonation. It has a smooth finish, and is easy to enjoy. This is a good belgian with unique flavors and characteristics that are definitely worth checking out if you are looking for something a little bit different. Enjoy."
"Not what I would expect from Belgium. The tinny characteristic, while mild, is annoying. The caramel aspect isn't bad, but seems too little, too late to really help, and it's rather one-dimensional to boot. The spiciness that I expect were muted. While it's true that it is at a fair price for a six-pack, I'll be skipping this one and splurge for something with more character."
"Taste is not exactly what most people look for in a Dubbel, but I stand by my judgement; it's amazingly good. Notes of creamy malts, cola, apricot, persimmon, citrus, and grape. A hoppy finish balances it all out. It's my second time trying this beer, first time reviewing, and it has withstood my developing tastes. Mouthfeel is juicy and crisp, with a perfect carbonation level. The aftertase, while not immense, is definately present. Overall, it's a decently complex, great beer (perhaps lacking the depth of most dubbels, though). In my opinion, however, Grimbergen's Dubbel is better tasting than most ""certified"" Belgian Abbey ales. Don't sleep on this one!"
"Pours a dark reddish brown with a firm beige cap displaying some nice stick. Aromas of earthy malts, toasted hops and slight acidic alcohol esters. Dominant malt profile is nutty, toasted, burnt caramel, and dates. Yeast is earthy and mild and the hops has virtually faded with just hints of a light herbal spice remaining in the middle. Brown sugar, maple syrup sweetness throughout. The end of the swill displays some heavier dark fruit character and then moves into the finish. Mouthfeel is between a light airiness and creamy. Alcohol and metallic tones are noticeable but not degrading."
"DA: I was shocked to find this at my local convienence store here in NH along with the blonde...this belgian ale is highly drinkable and might be the first authentic belgian ""Abbey ale"" i've ever seen in a local market here in southern NH. I will continue to enjoy this stuff for a long time to come."
"Poured an opaque and ruddy dark brown. Head was small and tan. Taken to the nose , aromas are dark fruits like grape and plum , yeast , some chocolate , and a bit of bready malt. Taste is is nice mix of sweet malt , chocolate , some more fruitiness on the dark/red side , tinge of metallic flavor near the finish. There is some noble hop bitterness and a light spice in the finish and the aftertaste is of fruit, yeast, and slight steel. Mouthfeel is quite light Overall a nice drinking Dubbel. Didn't wow me but it was definatly well crafted."
"I wold love to find this on tap to reveal it's malty nature."
"Not a bad beer at all. Seems to be a decent Dubbel that I wouldn't mind having again."
"Served a bit cold on tap in Australia."
"Having had nearly all the Trappist dubbels colors my notion of what a dubbel is supposed to be. This is a good beer, but lacks the amazing depth of character that I look for in an abbey ale. For starters the Grimbergen product is lower in strength than most abbey dubbels and appeas to not be bottle-conditioned and probably filtered. Even so, this beer has wonderfully rich malty sweetness and full body and satsfying grainy-toasty notes. I would happily serve this alongside a roast leg of lamb or a braised beef dish. I'm glad I have a few left from the sixer I got. I have some cooking to do."
"Strongly reminiscent of Tilburg's, but arguably more balanced. A good quaffer, but nothing to rave about--you can always find something better to drink."
"Overall this is a fine Belgian Dubbel and it's quite reasonably priced."
"Drinkability: Overall a pleasant beer worth having."
"Thanks to my great son, studying overseas in Amsterdam, I was sent this for the unique chance to enjoy."
"Drinkability: Good beer that has been worth drinking. I won't be coming back to it though, too thin and too nutty but a good example of the style."
"Drinkability- I enjoyed this beer very much. I was impressed by it because it was just a quick pick and then head home to BA it. Its a good berr for when you want to take it easy from the Optimator and Stone IPA."
"Drinkability is nice. No real alcohol bite at all which is surprising for even its ABV. I could drink a few of these."
"Overall, a good beer but not worth the price."
"Drinkability is very good. The flavor balance is good and this goes down easy enough to enjoy more than one at a time."
"Double Ale. Pours ruby-brown with a nice white-tan head that last pretty much through the entire beer. Has sort of a grainy smell. Nice sweet dark taste, with no real hint of alcohol. Feels very thick in the mouth, almost chewable, then the aftertaste kind of dries it up. Decent beer."
"All in all, still a good beer."
"Medium/heavy bodied, definitely a sipping beer, maybe with a sweet chocolate desert, otherwise something for after dinner."
"Thumbs down here for just the flavor."
"Overall this is a very fine looking and tasting beer. I don't think I'd reccommend drinking several in a row, but if you'd like a nice sipping beer that is almost wine-like, this certainly fits the bill."
"D- Not too strong for a dubbel. Althought it isn't extremely dubbel-ish it still tastes really great to me. I would drink it anytime."
"This beer poured a dark brown color with a large head. Nice lacing. The smell was light and not very noticeable . The taste was sour and alcoholic, also slightly malty and sweet. The mouthfeel was full with a carbonation kick. This beer feels very bright and explosive in your mouth. I'd say this is a delicious beer that I'd love to hae on any number of occasions."
"I usually order this at my favourite Belgian restaurant."
"Overall a nice dubbel. Not an everyday drinker, but recommended nonetheless."
"Purchased: Plaza Liquors, Tucson AZ"
"This poured to a dark red plum color with a finger thick head and lots of lacing. Even smells like a malty plum mmm. The darn puff bar my wife likes served it to cold so I let it warm a bit while she worked on the martini. Mouth feel was light I thought it could use a bit more carbonation but it may have been do to the serving temperature. Taste of malt with a hint of fruity undertones plum and granny smith apple very drinkable, wish I didn't have to drive home or I would have had another."
"Note: I was a little worried that this was old since it had 2001 printed on the bottle (I might have misread the code though). It certainly tasted as if it still had several more years left in it."
"Mouthfeel is dry, but quite good. Drinkability is also nice, but not outstanding for a Dubbel."
"D: This is really, really nice. It's not my favorite Dubbel (Hi, Westmalle! Hi, Chimay!), but this is still a pretty excellent beer. I would absolutely drink this again. Fruity, malty, sweet, comforting."
"Opinion: This is a really good beer. I am a little more used to a Dubbel being heavier with more syrupiness, but I am enjoying the light balance that I am getting from this beer. It is dangerously drinkable, and I could easily put away quite a few of these. I would definitely drink this beer again."
"When poured it showed a medium dark brown with a fine layer of tan foam with a form of lace on the side of my glass. Also I got a since of toasty toffee and caramel with layer of soft malts and hops, also a hint of spices. A big beer without being heavy. Very well balanced."
"Overall, I'm quite impressed with this stuff. It has better than expected complexity, the flavors are rich and strong, and the mouthfeel is very pleasant. Definitely recommended, a solid brew here."
"Hefty body with a fairly smooth mouthfeel, the alcohol let's itself be known...it truly seems like a 9%ABV+, in flavor and in effect. A good drinking strong brew that suits it's style well. Recommended...cheers!"
"GRIMBERGEN!"
"Good, but a little too much of something for me to want more than one of at a sitting."
"Pours a clear dark brown with a creamy pale biege head of three fingers. Excellent retention that leaves rings of silky lace. Mild aroma; raisins and plums with some weak belgian phenols. Taste is sweet with crystal and toasted pale malt, a pinch of smoked malt, and mild plum esters. The aftertaste is semi-dry with very mild, indistinct hops. The low carbonation and medium body allow a slickness that gradually becomes more pronounced , which detracts form drinkability. Finishes residual and mildy fruity, this is a decent abbey ale, but a far cry from the better Dubbels that are more widely available."
"Body is a bit too thin for my liking, but otherwise a quality beer."
"Drinkability - Like I said, I can't have more than one of these without getting sick of it."
"it's actually more like a tripel with dark malt influences"
"Poured into a Grimbergen glass. Deep brown color. Cola looking body with a ruby red base. Topped by a thick tan head with good staying power. The smell is caramely, and toffee-sweet. Barely-noticable alcohol sub-tones. Tastes like Belguim. I got a hint of fruit or berry and a light hop bitterness to balance it out. Still on the sweet side, and alcohol is a bit noticable. Mouthfeel is suprisingly light-bodied. A bit astringent on the swallow, and this hinders drinkability a bit."
"D - It is quite drinkable but not too many at one sitting because it is fairly heavy."
"Grimbergen is a quality beer. Very enjoyable at any time of the day and with or without food to pair it with."
"Not a bad beer and worth trying."
"I think that this is a clean yet very unremarkable double ale. I find that it lacks any kind of real distinction other than it is true to style."
"My only regret is I only brought home one 750ml corked/caged bottle when I should have grabbed 2, especially at only 5 Euro each..."
"Overall a great dubbel easy to drink and smooth tasting"
"Presented in a Grimbergen chalice. A 3/4"" light tan head over the barely translucent dark brown (with burgundy highlights) brew, which laces heavily. Light doughy aroma, with spicy highlights. Taste is balanced, lightly spiced, with a sedate sweet aftertaste. Mouthfeel and drinkability were good as well, worth your trouble."
"It took me three or four times of trying this beer to get a feel for it. I finally drank it in a Duvel Tulip and that seemed to help. Pours a beautiful dark amber color with a fluffy head, leaving lacing down the glass. Smells of dried, sweet plums and other tangy fruits. Has a true belgian tangy, dubbel, fruit taste. Really interesting. Was overpriced in Florida, but since moving to Ohio, this belgian beer is a new favorite, and reasonably priced. Last thing is, not as strong as most belgians and can be used as a session brew!"
"A decent balance in the nose and on the tongue. A little bit of a harsh, woody aftertaste but not overwhelming. A middle of the road dubbel, many better out there."
"Very dry, fairly mild for a dubbel. Hints of pepper behind seltzer. When swirled, very creamy and drinkable. Best when warmer and held in the mouth."
"12 ounce bottle."
"Pours a dark amber with a half finger head. Aroma is of malt, plum and caramel. Mouthfeel is slightly chewy with good carbonation. Taste is much the same of the aroma with plenty of dark fruits and malt. Overall a tasty beer but it just seems like something is missing in this brew."
"Overall this goes down pretty smoothe and is a great beer. Considering I got the sixer for six bucks this was a great buy. I'll give it another shot real soon."
"A good solid beer, but could be a much more drinkable one if the carbonation level were lowered."
"D - moderate to high, a great beer, easy down"
"D: A decent Dubbel, but I've had better. Could be a bit more invigorating."
"Belgian beers always have some of the best appearances, so I can be pretty critical about them even if they are better than a lot of other beers. This poured nicely and formed a decent head that just kind of fizzled away instead of breaking apart in nice bubbles. The smell was average for a dubble. It had very carmel malt-like flavor the finished with a semi-sweet apple flavor that was balanced between sweet and dry. There was a slight metalic flavor I was not too fond of. The drinkablity was just OK. All in all there was not much that stood out about this beer. I wouldn't discourage it, but you can find better."
"Paid only 1.35 euro for a bottle. Pours a dark mahogany wood stain color. Very clear. Good head that dissipates fast. Smells fantastic, candied fruit and malt. The smell seems to drift in the air, you notice this one from a distance. Taste is good - again candied fruits and malt with a bit of maple syrup and some astringent/sugary taste lingering behind. Mouthfeel is ok - heavy foam bubble but not too sharp. Drinkability is good - good taste good price."
"notes: Nice price for an imported belgian style brew. I consider this pretty average compared to other dubbels, meaning its damn tasty, heavily towards the sweet, malted, and of course that distinct belgian smell that I get from a distinct yeast. dissapointing? nahhhh, Great? nahhhh....damn fine brew...Yupp."
"A good Belgian, just what I was looking for right now."
"Drinkability- Very drinkable dubbel. More so because of the incrdeible mouthfeel though. Flavor is above average, if not on the better dubbels I've had, but overall it's a real nice package deal."
"Very drinkable and would pair with many things due to it mildness."
"Drinkability is not bad but I do know of many better versions. A mild tasting example of the beer style I guess there are some that would seek this out."
"As dubbels go, this is definately in range. Not outstanding, nor exceedingly complex, but quite good all-around. Seems a bit big in the mouth, a tad too sugary, but nonetheless, a solid beer."
"This beer started good, but couldn't keep it's promise! A pity!"
"I would buy this again."
"Aside- The Maes family sent their kids to intern in Marketing at the Miller Brewery HQ when I was their in the mid '80's ..."
"Maybe at the price I paid, this is the holy grail."
"That said, it can't compare with the top-shelf varieties such as St. Bernardus Prior 8, La Trappe dubbel, or even Maredsous 8. But not bad for middle tier."
"Pous a nice dark amber body with good head and very nice lacing. Smell is a bit weak. Aroma of spicey fruit. Taste would be good if it wasn't for a strong and unexpected grape character. The grape really throws the beer as without it, it'd a respectable dubbel. And while it has nice mouthfeel, the grape permeates the aftertaste and really takes the fun out of drinking it."
"This brew is my favorite pub beer. Recently the local pub I go to lost his distributor and it is really killing me. Deep brown on the pour with an off white head with good lacing. Smells sweet with malt and fruit and taste the same with a neat finish. Not as complex as your high end trappist but the easiest drinking beer I have ever had much better on tap btw."
"Really good stuff. I'm surprised I haven't reviewed this before. It's much better on tap than from the bottle. Fruity and tart in the aromas. Lots of malt, raspberries, dates, figs, and a tad of chocolate. Looks moderately thick and well carbonated. A lightly tanned head accompanied the beer to the bottom of the glass. Tastes much like it smells, with emphasis on dark berry sweetness and tartness. Sweet and spicy notes decorate the heavy malt structure. Feels full and rich without being thick or cloying. Finishes strong and sweet. Maybe a little tacky and dry from the alcohol. Worth drinking from time to time."
"Easily drinkable, but just an above average Dubbel. It's got all of the necessary ingredients, but just falls short of being among the top tier of the style."
"Sampled just shy of a pitcher of this beer tonight. It poured a soild dark brown color with nice ruby highlites. A finger of off white head sat atop the beer. Nose was nice and sweet, with notes of brown sugar and maple syrup, with back notes of raisin and fig. Flavor was dominated with sweet notes of brown sugar and maple, most likely from dark candied sugar in harmony with some special B. Flavor follows the nose in being brown sugary and maple sweet with raisin notes hanging in the back. Light alcohol notes find their way in, but not offensively and well melded. Feel was moderate with a full moderate carbonation. Overall, this was a very nice brew. Aroma and flavors worked well together. Seemed to be missing the typical belgian spicey chartacter, but it didn't take away from the brew. A beer I would have again."
"Not drinkable because it is just not likable. For a Dubbel this beer is thin and lacking flavor. Even if I set aside the style this beer is not tasty. If I had a 750ml I would dump most of it. Thankfully all I have is an 11.2oz bottle. I will finish it but I will not revisit this beer again. For a Dubbel this beer is lousy... as a beer, this beer is lousy too. I never heard of this beer before I seen a few bottles in Lawrence, KS. So I bought one you can skip it though."
"It has a soft, medium body, lots of foam and fizz. Tealike aftertaste, a little bit of that root beer thing. A modest dubbel."
"poured a deep reddish brown color with massive tannish head. Lacing is absolutely beautiful. Smell is an excellent mixture of malt and dark fruit (plums, prunes. raisins, dates). Excellent mixture. Probably the biggest dissapointment I've had in a beer. After the terrific smell, the taste leaves much to be desired. Its difficult to describe. The fruits are still there, but they taste spoiled. No enjoyment at all. Hops are too strong, and the balance is missing. Not very drinkable at all."
"Poured a dark garnet with a few fingers of off-white head. Nose is sweet and fruity with some yeasty mustiness. Taste is sugary sweet, candied fruit and some caramel malt. Mouthfeel is a little on the thin side for my liking. Overall a tasty dubbel, very drinkable and very sweet. Probably not for everyone, but worth a try."
"Almost a dessert beer. Very sweet, nearly cloying, and fruity. Not as juicy as a lambic, but brings that to mind. Not bad, not great."
"Brownish red in color with dark tan head. Smell is chocolate, caramel, yeast, bananas, very fruity. Smells good! Taste is more of the same, on the sweet side, earthy and with plenty of fruit. Mouthfeel is medium-full and creamy and fluffy. Quite pleasant and drinkable. One of the better dubbels I've had recently."
"Color is an interesting crimson, topped with a decent amount of foamy tan head. Nose is fruity-sweet and somewhat caramely, but not particularly assertive. Taste was nice up front--gentle malts that impart a light chocolaty taste. But this one suffered from a too-watery mouthfeel and metallic aftertastes. Not a bad beer, mind you, but there are better examples of the style out there."
"A very drinkable, smooth and delectable beer. Most enjoyable. I'll seek out a few more of these."
"Worth a shot if you like darker, sweeter beers."
"Small bottle sampled, dating on the label but not sure what it means...oh well, maybe if I spoke Flemish...this one pours dark almond, mahogony fairly clear and supports a dark tan head, which is showing good retention. Leaves some stringy and scattered lacing. Aroma of dark berries, fruit and some rum raisin. Medium bodied Belgian, lots of fruit and smoky raisins and earthy woodyness picked up. Fairly sweet but quite drinkable. Decent, if not spectacular dubbel. Lacks the bold flavors and complexity of the monsters of the style, still worth a try."
"Good beer, just not a great dubbel. A bit pricey."
"Mouthfeel is very good, and this still remains a very easy to drink dubble. It's not an every day beer but for special occasions or just when I'm in the mood for something different this is a pretty good choice."
"Nice carbonation. A noticable creamy mouthfeel."
"Definitely a drinkable belgium double, and unique. Not sure how crazy I am about it though. If you're new to the dubbel style, you'd probably be wise to start elsewhere."
"This bier pours a nice cloudy brownish color and it came violently out of it's bottle an into my glass, probably from health fermentation in the bottle. It has a nice white head that leaves tons of lace and it lasts until the glass is empty. It has a nice fruity, estery, yeasty aroma that is quite complex. The flavor is sweet and the alcohol is very noticeable and it sometimes overpowers the experience. It certainly is drinkable and I was not expecting much from a non Trappist Dubbel so on one hand I am surprised and on the other I ask myself if it is worth the price I had to pay for a six pack...$13... I say not when there are far superior Dubbels to choose from, but if you want something that comes close and will get you drunk faster than a 40 of something bad and there is nothing else better to be had then this beer will do ok."
"Probably the worst Dubbel I can remember having. This showed up in my local beer store this week, so I grabbed a single to try. I really didn't expect much, and I was right. Thin, watery, with a strange aftertaste. I had it with dinner, but didn't finish it. I've certainly had worse beers, but there are too many great examples of this style to settle for this one. If you can find the Loterbol, you can see what a great dubbel should taste like (or, of course, the Westy or Westmalle)."
"This brew pours a cloudy, shadowy brownish rust color. The head is a thick, creamy tan foam. I really appreciated this aroma: sugar and malt, slight ethanol, fruit (plums), and an intense, meaty (literally) yeastiness. The taste has a lingering sweetness and a round fruitiness that fit the beer well. Nice malt flavor as well. Peppery finish. Moderate carbonation. This is a very estery and yeasty beer. My wife didnt like it for those reasons, but I thought that it hit the spot!"
"33 cl bottle coded L531. Pours a nice muddied burgundy shade with a fluffy greyish-beige head. Dark roasted candi sugars and Belgian Special B malts with some fruity esters similar to candied cherries, and a distinct woody sourness present in the nose. Malty and sugary sweet with a lightly hoppy and sour finish. Light tea-like astringency and faint Flemish red sourness is quite unique and a nice change of pace for a dubbel. Fruity esters abound. It's been a while since I had one of these and I'm glad I decided to grab one when I saw it. Very drinkable and easy to enjoy. Now if I could only find their tripel..."
"Taste: More of those same flavors from the nose here in the flavor, dark fruits aplenty, deep and plentiful, this is a nice double, but not in the realm of the transcendent. Nutty, fruity, dark, and just a little yummy. Full-bodied, with a long, fruity finish. A nice drinker, easy going, I'd recommend it, but not over any other dubbel...plenty of other tasty beers out there. I'd urge you to acquaint you with them, and not to worry about this one. I've tried it, time to move on to the next...."
"Pours a rich brownish amber with a monsterous head and lacing. The aroma is dominated by a warming brown sugar presence with a malt hint. Flavor is a pretty standard for a dubbel, hints of toffee and raisin. Overall not spectacular, but a great example of a dubbel."
"The flavors involved were very average. Fruits do come out in the fairly sweet smell. The taste was mostly of malts with some degree of fruit. The mouthfeel was a touch too thin, although the drinkability was good."
"Poured from 11.2 oz squat bottle labeled 08-01-05. Pours a clear deep dark burgundy, with a dense frothy ecru head that leaves sticky lace on the chalice. Yeast and fruits in the nose. Taste is plum fruits, less of malts and sweet grape.. Sweeter as it warmed. Moderate mouthfeel, light carbonation. Easy drinking."
"Looks like a cup of really dark iced tea, with a medium brown body, semi-translucent, with a creamy tan head. Smells sticky-sweet, with hints of bubblegum and raisins, and sweet citrus. Taste is rich and malty, with strong raisin and bread flavors that give it a somewhat grainy mouthfeel. Alcohol is present, but not evasive. A very good beer, and a welcome price for a bottle of belgian beer."
"This brew pours a dark reddish-brown color with a thick beige head that disappeared pretty fast. Decent lacing. The aroma is malty and sweet but there is a hint of sour fruit at times as well. Medium-bodied with a vinous character. Malt, hops and a touch of alcohol dont seem to mesh well for some reason. The flavor is decent but unbalanced somehow. The finish is fruity and sweet. Overall a decent Dubbel but I feel it could be much better."
"Attractive mahogany brown body with a sandy foam head that fades into a grainy satelite photo of a hurricane, eye and all. The aroma and flavor start off slight, with mostly a bit of yeast and toffee, but near the end of the glass, you start picking up a bit of artificial grape candy and at the very end, that grape candy starts to pick up a bit of vinegar. Not bad, but not great either."
"A good wet Dubbel!"
"Pours a clear reddish brown. Has an off white head which leaves a beautiful lace. Mild aroma of black pepper, spices, and caramel. Light to medium bodied, it has a chalky, dry mouthfeel. A malty caramel sweetness dominates the flavor. A nice, easy drinking brew ."
"Deep russet with a slight haze. Ample, pitted, stiff light tan head leaves dense, coating lace. Aroma dominated by notes of underripe red grape and phenolic red pepper. Secondary hints of baker's chocolate and must. Prosaic aromawise. Prevalent in flavor is a stately plum tartness, complete with astringent tones from the skin. Sweetness, which offers adequate contrast, takes on a soft apple cider nature when combined with the acetaldehyde undertone. As the beer warms, bittersweet dark chocolate tones augment, but remain understated. Rather clean for phenolics, with only trace clove perceived. Lightly bodied and dry, but rather thirst quenching as a result. Finishes with fleeting hints of bread crust and granny smith apple. A rather simple dubbel that grew on me. It's clean in regards to esters and phenols and sits softly on the palate. Middling in flavor, yet highly drinkable."
"Pours a beautiful light mahogany with an average size frothy, light brown head. Good head retention and lacing. Floral nose that also includes toffee. Initial taste reveals sweetness, toffee, and a nice malty, long finish. At one point I am sure I tasted green table grapes, hmmm. Seems a bit lacking in body for a Dubbel. A bit of well-balanced acidity on the finish. However, it certainly is a drinkable beer and would be a good ""starter"" for those interested in stepping into the world of Belgian beers(perhaps from the Nut Brown realm). Price is nice. Could this be the the Belgians searching for a beer more favorable to the mass palate in the US?"
"Pours a deep amber with a quickly dissipating head that leaves wonderful lacing. Smell is lightly malty with some fruity elements. Taste is similarly lightly fruity with a tart finish that is ok, but not spectacular. Mouthfeel is fairly light with a good deal of carbonation...decent tart finish. Drinkability is ok, and I might have another ... a decent enough offering for the price."
"Very cool bottle 11.2oz with a stained glass eagle on the label. This is a very fine beligan dubbel with a nice price tag. I paid $1.59 each for these and it was well worth it. A raison colored body with very thin head. The taste is wrapped together with sweet and coffee-like finish. The semi-low ABV suits this beer well. This would be an excellent beer for new BAs looking to tap into the Begium brews."
"Drinkable per session but more than two wouldn't work."
"Uncertain murky ruddy-chestnut brown color with a small beige head thats compact and fluffy, minimal lacing coats the glass. Aroma is sultry and cheesy with a yeasty, nearly barnyard, wet old mop-like smell over a largely sweet malt base of darker fruits, toffee, red licorice, and molasses. Quite a interesting nose. That extra little yeasty funk is intrigueing and likeable. Flavors stay malty sweet and tangy with a darker tone of fruity stuff with raisin, prune, and plum, bits of dried chewy apricot and starfruit. Yeasty play of dull spices also adding a bit of wood, mushroom musk, and cheese. Interesting flavor play but it also seemed a bit plain, even with the little nuances being picked up, nothing really stands out. Miraculously subtle, but was missing the fruity snap and character I like to see in a dubble. Something seems off or unbalanced but what is implies an undiscernable impression. Feel is quite smooth, full and creamy, frothy textured, malty with a bit of spice and some slight dullish-like drying. I'd have this again, no doubt, the numbers don't show how much I actually liked it. A bit different and slightly off for what I've come to know as a good dubble for my tastes, but wait...I thought it was good, so I guess it is."
"The beer as it sets in the glass a dark amber to brown color with a modest and somewhat creamy head that is light tan in color, the resultant lace a thick and clinging sheet. Nose is caramel, yeasty and sweet, fresh and clean to the senses with the start sweet and loaded with malt, top is moderate in its feel. Finish is benignly acidic, the hops delectable in their spines, quite dry after taste and a great drinking beer, Grimbergen ranks high on my list of Belgian Breweries."
"Dark burnt siena color, chill hazed but hard to see if its heavily sedimented. Darker yellowish head of 1/2 an inch for about 40 seconds. Good lace, attractive and crystalline. Aroma has notes of dark fruit, figs, dried apricots, slightly cognac-like. Carbonation is full but understated in a soft sense of small bubbles. Body about shy of medium overall. Flavor shows a slight sense of overdone alcohol, emerges as a slug of yellow raisins and the least bit of semi-sweet chocolate. Better hopped than some Dubbels, relatively bitter in the close for style. The fruity maltiness doesn't have an evolving emerging sense in this one like many of the other Dubbels that I tend to like more."
"Is it worth the money? Perhaps, perhaps not...it may be better suited with food that matched it, perhaps some dark desserts or bitter chocolates to counter the sweetness."
"Sub-medium bodied. A bit lifeless, hollow and underwhelming in dubbel terms, but this is recued with a relatively high score for mindless drinkability."
"Pours cloudy brown color with a huge light brown head that sticks to the sides of my glass. Fruity sweet and spicy aromas, sugary plum and grape flavors, medium bodied with a crisp almost soda like mouthfeel, finishes with a strange sweetness, not my favorite."
"This one poured a brown color with a huge head (stop the foam!) and left some nice lacing on the glass. The aroma was very fruity and there is a subtle hint of alcohol. The flavor was much the same - fruity and peppery with a malty character. This was a pretty good beer. Drinks easily and is very much enjoyed."
"A remarkably easy dubble despite its complexities. Less dry than, say, Duinen or Westmalle. I bet lovers of fruitier red wines would consider this a conversion drink."
"11.2 oz bottle poured at cellar temperature into a St Bernardus goblet. Appearance is a beautiful cherry mahogany, with a curious, tan head consisting of many sized and textured bubbles. Head eventually receded into sheet lacing. Aroma was raisins, cloves, and fresh baked French bread. Mouthfeel was full bodied, and typical of an abbey dubbel. Taste was very malt based, even for a Belgian. Plums, cherries, raisinbread, bananabread, and some alcohol presence, all combined well for a nice and smooth sipping experience. Finishes smooth and easy."
"From an 11.16 oz bottle (where'd the other .04 oz go), it pours a deep copper with a very aggressive tan head that leaves lace down the side of the glass and continues to float at about 1/8"" on top of the beer until the end. The smell has the ripe fruit (raisin and cherry) expected but the alcohol smell is surprisingly strong for a 6.5% beer. A fairly strong metallic flavor is immediately noticeable. The nice fruit flavor works hard to come to the forefront but manages only to lurk in the background, a bit frustratingly. Everything is so close to being right, but it's not quite there."
"Drinkability. Well the taste was nice. A little too sweet. There are better choices, but I could have a couple in one sitting."
"ive had plenty better, but hey, if you can get a real belgian ale on tap that can do the job as adequately as grimberger, its hard to complain. always worth consideration when youre out and about, as any reputable euro beer lounge will have this on the go. and considering the alternative if leffe, well i know where id rather be."
"Color was a rich brown with black and red hues--really pretty color. Head was mountainous, long-lasting, and extremely fragrant. Notes of figs, plums (yea I noticed them too), molasses, and a coffee/chocolate/caramel combo overwhelm the taste buds. All flavors are very individual but blend together nicely. At 6.8 you know your drinking a strong beer but it doesn't knock you on your butt like some other brews (especially if your drinking it at .3 liter incriments). Good beer."
"(old - aged a few years)"
"Dark amber color. Medium head. Aroma is molasses and caramel. A medium bodied Belgian double. Slightly sweet malts, choclately and coffeeish. Other flavors are plums, wood and apricots. Slightly spicy. Very drinkable, Slightly warming. Smooth taste. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly sweet."
"Pours a dark amber color and forms a large darker than tan head. Has a very sweet aroma of raisins/plums. Taste is dominated by the raisiny/plum mixture. Roasted barley/wood come into play next. Finishes with a dextrin sweetness combined with some sour notes that I couldn't distinguish. This has a thin to medium body. Pretty complex but not balanced enough."
"Beautiful reddish colour, good head. Surprisingly weak initial aroma, improves as the beer warms up - toffee, caramel and oak. Malty caramel flavour with some cloves, a tad too sweet for my taste. Needs some more hops to balance the sweetness. Malty, rounded aftertaste."
"A medium bodied Belgian double. Slightly sweet malts, chocolately and coffeeish. Other flavors are plums, wood and apricots. Slightly spicy. Very drinkable, Slightly warming. Smooth taste. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly sweet. Nice."
"L=4.5, A=4.0, T=4.0, MF=4.0, D=3.0"
"Grimbergen Dubbel carries a deep brown body with hints of red in the light. The head poured thick, but it dissipated rather quickly. The aroma contains hints of nuts, and a complex fruity nose along with mocha and barley. In the taste detected flavors of anis, and a roasted barley on the palate. Overall it leaves a nice bitterness, but in my opinion something is unbalanced in the flavor. It is enjoybable, but it feels that something is lacking to make it's flavors work better together."
"A solid dubbel. Dark amber, adequate tan head. Dark ripe fruity and nutty aroma. Smooth and rich...coats the throat nicely. Raisin/prune and over ripened apricot flavor. Carbonation level and full mouthfeel are spot on. Alcohol pokes around the palette casually. A nice find."
"Bottled. Horrifically sweet toffee apple flavour. Very cloying. The sweetest and worst Dubbel i've ever had. Too much toffee and sweetness, no other flavours that stick out. Not a good example of the style in my opinion. Iverly sweet, flat and syruppy, very bad, worst dubbel i've had."
"Well carbonated and hopped, but finish had an artificial sweetener character.  Seemed mass produced and not well executed."
