"Overall: Since this beer is now retired it can be hard to find. I'm going to source another 2-3 4-packs and enjoy this one for years to come. I love the Dubbel style and this is a fantastic example from a world class brewery. This beer screams ""Cellar me!!"" I have not tried a fresh example but the cellared ones are worth every penny."

"Overall: I liked this beer a lot. I have a hard time giving perfect scores so I toned the scored back a lot, but I'm going to see if I can track down another one of these. I doubt there are too many around, which is a shame."

"Cloudy caramel pour with a light, creamy head that lingers as a khaki ring around the glass.  The nose really sings of yeast, malt, and Sour Punch Straws.  Sorry, I couldn't resist, but it is true!  Loved those things.  Candied fruit is at the front of the flavor profile as well with a warm, smooth, boozy finish.  Goose Island brings it again for me.  Strong and interesting brew."

"Malty Overtones. Would make an excellent dessert beer"

"Carmel in color, sweet on the nose with a warm maltiness. The flavour is rich, malty, and sweet. This has become a favorite, at least the 2012"
"Bottle from July 2012 poured into tulip glasses and shared.  Beautiful clear chestnut brown color with half finger of slightly off-white head that dissipates and leaves minimal lacing.  Nice dried fruit and Belgian candy aroma.  Taste is delicious and perfect to the style - raisins, currants, dried apricot, candy, and a slight sharp bitterness to offset the sweet.  Mouth feel was dryer than I expected, making the beer seem thin for style, but actually probably makes it more drinkable.  Overall, a pretty solid take on the Belgian Dubbel, albeit a bit pricey in this case ($9.50 for 22 oz)."

"Abbey's aren't my favorite style, but I enjoy one every now and then.  I prefer a tripel or a saison.  I'm aging a couple of 2013's though to see how they develop."

"I am not a huge fans of Belgians so I had been sitting on this bottle for awhile. I cracked it open when my brother in laws came over. I was pleasantly surprised. It was sweet, smooth beer that I can only imagine aging helped make more subtle. The yeasty flavor was there but it was in the background and also subtle. Overall, a nice beer."

""
""
""
""
"Overall:"
""
"Pours cloudy brown with a medium beige head. Aroma and taste is of caramel malt, yeast and some sweet dark fruit notes with light bitterness. Palate is a medium body, mild carbonation with a sweet yeast and light sticky mouth feel. Sweet caramel malt, yeast with light bitterness on the end. A smooth flavorful and tasty brew."
""
""
"Poured from 76mL bottle into a snifter, pours a beautiful mahogany color, like nothing I've seen before with a tan 2 finger head and modest lacing. (One of the best pours I've had yet). Aroma is exceptional as well, at first you can smell the 8% alcohol, but then it opens up to some fruitiness (notably raisins or bubble gum), and then a slight matly smell to finish. Taste is not as great as the aroma, still pleasant though. First upon entering my mouth, like the aroma, first taste was the alcohol content, but as it sits in your mouth the fruitiness comes to life and the after taste is that of smoky maltiness. The mouthfeel is very creamy, which is deceptive, as it looks like a very thin bodied beer. Overall a good beer, could be one of the best I've had if the flavor was a bit better. I'd have it time and time again though, for sure!"

"2012 bottle poured into a tulip. Poured a deep amber touching on brown. One finger white head with good lacing. Oak, banana, and a touch of spice in the aroma. Yeast presence is strong with a fair amount of sweetness akin to mellon going on. Fairly viscous with a nice bitter after bite."
""
""
""
""
"This is the 2012 batch for this brew. Right on target for a Belgian Ale. Taste, color and aroma are all reminiscent of a real Belgian abbey ale. Nice job and well done. Delicious!"
""
""
"O: A well-crafted beer. Full of sweet flavors, but I had hoped for something a bit more, I guess. I was just left wanting more. I'd drink it again, but I wouldn't pay as much as I did for it."
""
""
""
""
""
"Great beer. Delicious, complex but not overwhelmingly so. Repeatable and worthy of stocking in your beer fridge."

"Picked up a 12 ounce bottle from the local bottle shop (took a try on a 2013... thought it could handle the age well)... not expecting be knocked out but wanting to give another Goose Island a try. Poured into my tulip glass. Nothing tremendous on appearance... unfiltered (that's ok), 1/2 finger of head was gone quickly, interesting mahogany hue. The aroma was awesome... raisins and dark fruit, apples or pears, molasses, and of course, Belgium. Aside from the presence of alcohol in the taste, all of the aromas were strong in the flavor profile. Not a ton of the 'funk', and overall a great flavor balance. Velvety mouthfeel... one of the most enjoyable I have tried for mouthfeel. Overall, this was excellent... great balance to this beer, and a pleasant surprise. As a big IPA and stout guy, before long I might be drawn to more of the Belgian styles... pick one up."

"12 ounce bottle into chalice, bottled on 2/21/2012. Pours moderately cloudy ruby copper color with a 1 finger fairly dense khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a thin lace cap that lingers. Slight spotty lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big raisin, prune, fig, pear, apple, light banana, brown sugar, toffee, toast, clove, light pepper, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of fruity/earthy yeast ester and dark malt notes; with great strength. Taste of raisin, prune, fig, pear, apple, light banana, caramel, toast, toffee, brown sugar, brown bread, light chocolate, clove, light pepper, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Light earthy spiciness on the finish; with lingering notes of raisin, prune, fig, pear, apple, caramel, toast, toffee, brown sugar, brown bread, light chocolate, clove, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice complexity and robustness of fruity/earthy yeast and dark/bready malt flavors; with a great malt/yeast flavor balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth and fairly slick/bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice dubbel style. All around good balance, complexity, and robustness of fruity/earthy yeast and dark malt flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the ABV. A very enjoyable offering."

"Overall- this was a solid but not spectacular beer but one of the better goose island beers I have had."
"The quality of these beers continues to impress me, and it is a brand I am happy to support."
"Goose Island, I'm delighted that Bud hasn't killed your goodness."
""
""
""
"Remarks: Very tasty overall"
"Good ester character, but the malt is a bit too sweet. Alcohol is more overwhelming than I would like."

"D: This was a nice BSDA, with enjoyable scent and taste and decent body. The finish was smooth, although it was a bit hot, so it was easier to sip. Nothing amazing about this beer, but a fairly solid brew. Age would likely really help."
""
""
""
""
"It has a reddish-brown iced tea color with a two finger white head that settles quickly. Sweet, clean malts show up on the nose with some green apple skin, toast, and some low peppery notes. It has a sweet, malt-forward flavor with raisins, figs, fresh bread, slight yeast, and slight clove spiciness. It has no bitterness but is not overly sweet, either. Goes down smooth with a medium body and low carbonation. The nicest dubbel brewed in the U.S. that I've had yet."

"The two to three year mark seems to be the magic time for this beer. Each progressively older beer drank smoother than its predecessor. I wish I would have had a 2009 to delve further into my findings, but I am happy that I got to taste a progression of a beer through three years of aging. I based my rating on the 2011 since it was the median."

"A pretty tasty and great ale that goes down smooth and is enjoyable. Not especially Belgian feeling though. That gripe aside, worth trying."

"Final Grade: 4.32, a very solid A. Goose Island's Père Jacques is one of the best dubbels I've had the opportunity to try in my 8 years on this site. It's not perfect, but it's still a very high-quality beer that manages to justify its hefty price point (at least in this province, where it is priced about the same as a bottle of mid-tier wine). All Belgian ale aficionados should consider this one worth at least one purchase, as it makes for an excellent warmer for the fall/winter months. Strongly considering picking up another bottle for cellaring purposes."
""
""
"Upon warming a bit, each sip tasted a little different, with caramel and toffee notes coming more to the forefront. A very elegant sipper that aged quite gracefully. A worth-the-wait little treat."
""
"O: As an abbey ale, this is a nice beer. It is flavorful and rich, and it is among the best examples of an American take on a dubbel I have tried so far. I would and do recommend this beer to others and I will seek it out again."
""
"Overall Impression: very good beer at a reasonable price point, I would purchase again"
""
"Abbey ale style? Sure I'll try it out. Poured into a glass Chamay goblet and, wow, it looks fantastic... Rich amber-brown hue, although not a lot of head with minimal lacing. Smells aromatic enough to pass for a Belgian... Taste is pretty well in line as well. Really good attempt and one that wouldn't mind having again. Definitely a reccomendation. Cheers!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Excellent looking beer, not clear, looks rich and tasty. Not a lot of head or lacing. Excellent smell, sweet and rich. Taste not quite as good as it smells. Very good but not excellent. Overall it is an outstanding beer but not excellent and for the cost there are to many that I prefer more."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, not bad. A good dubbel, but nothing special about it. If you could buy this or Westmalle (for example), it would be hard to imagine why you would ever choose this one."

""

"this not an easy Ale to make and maintain the flavors presented here ..nice work, complements again to the brewmaster"
""
""
""
""
"O: Good dubbel. Complex enough to keep things interesting and probably easy to obtain now. Worth a try."
""
""
""
""
"this is a very nice beer. very rooty and toasty malts, deep and dark. carbonation was on point. this was a small cup from a bottle at a tasting. sweet malts give way to a relativly dry peppered hops. hits you way in the back of your mouth, almost a sour bitter finish. the beer leans to the toasted peppery side of things and dries out a little bit but there is still complexity with in that area that it resides. I really love the hop profile goose Island has, its subtle and large at the same time, not over done and thats always welcomed."
""
"O: Drinking it is a delight, but I'd be just as happy sniffing it all night. I wasn't expecting this nuanced and complex of a beer, I love it, but not quite my favorite. Still recommended! Reinforced my faith in Goose Island."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Overall, I was surprised how much I liked this one. Very well done."
""
"O: One of the best from Goose Island. At least, it's one of the best that they distribute to CA."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Dark Belgian spices and some cola."
""
"Pere Jacques pours a hazy cloudy dark amber color, with a small lacing head. There is a dry fruit aroma with hints of Belgian candies. The taste has a nice sharp malty backbone, with good hints of candy flavors and strong dry fruit flavors. Good strong flavors, strong body, nice feel. Overall its a nice bold Dubbel that's very full, and a nice warm aftertaste."

"(3.75) D: This is a very good dubbel with a standout and diverse set of aromas but not necessarily a dubbel I would seek out again."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The body was the typical light-medium of the style, and the finish was clean and semi-dry. Drinkability was very good, I would happily drink a few more of these. Overall, a very nice brew, certainly worth your time if you see it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Prost!"
"From a 750 ml bottle into a tulip glass."
""
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle that says 2012 vintage into a tulip. Pours copper red very cloudy with a tiny white head. Smells of berries and apples very nice. Tastes of raisins and berries, nice combination. Beer is carbonated really nicely medium body goes down nicely. Overall a very good beer."
"O-Dubbels have become my favorate type of beer. Great color, smell, taste , and feel. Devolops in the bottle for 5 years. I will wait a year and try another it was great"

"Overall: This beer was enjoyable, and though probably better fresh (I've had it fresh too), it was very good aged and mellowed."
"Poured a brownish body with auburn tint with decent head/lace on top. Aroma is yeasty, sweet like caramel, figs, toffee, (dark fruit), not much hop bite or citric orange one might expect. Smooth, sweet, a fuller body that is slightly chewey, I get some some sweet malts liek caramel/toffee and dark fruits like figs (maybe raisins) and a touch of citric/orange, although I find the beers sweetness overpowers any fruit flavor complexity. Finishes crisp with a bite and is a strong, hearty beer that is enjoyable."
""
""
"Serving type: bottle, 2013 run"
""
""

"O: Very nice. One I'll be drinking again, on tap. So far, my favorite of the Goose Island higher end beers. Pepe Nero is next."

""

"O- Interesting beer, had a lot more alcohol presence than some higher % beers that ive had. Gonna pick some more up and let it celler for awhile and see if it balances out. Has a good flavor, but the alcohol kinda of overpowers it for me at the moment. Think it has potential still."

"A pretty nice dubbel. I tend to lean towards quads but this had some nice dark sweetness to it. Worth a go if it's available but nothing I'd recommend hunting."
"O: A little too hot with the alcohol which is not as well hidden as other examples in the Dubbel style - slightly too boozy for my personal preference. This beer needs to be slowly sipped to be enjoyed."

"O: it's been a while since I've had this brew, but I honestly don't remember this beer being this damn good. this vintage is drinking beautifully right now and definitely plan on aging a few more of these."

"O – Interesting one here. Very barley-wine esque with less hops. Lots of strong dark fruit, and grape must notes."
""
""
"O - Too sweet to finish. Tastes more like an imperial amber than a dubbel. There's probably an audience for this beer, but I'm not a member."
""
""
""
""
"Medium bodied with average carbonation. Nothing which really stands out here. There are better Dubbel's than this."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall – Reminds me a bit of a barleywine taste wise. It has a nice well balanced flavour and is very drinkable. Maybe just a touch too sweet, but the alcohol is well hidden. I'd buy a few more of these to see how they age."
"O - This is a very solid beer and a hit for Goose Island. I'd definitely recommend it to a friend and would love to have another."
""

""
"Kickass dubbel from a kickass brewery. Pere Jacques is very much recommendable."
""
""
""
"Overall - I enjoyed Pere jacques. Perhaps a higher score would have been warranted if the nose was brighter, but I am not really complaining. I can see how the syrupy sweetness may become overbearing with a second bomber, but overall I thought it was tasty."

"Had it out of a bottle, didn't pour it out so don't know what appearance it has but I significantly enjoyed. Definitely one of the best beers I ever had. It's a very smooth/juicy tasting beer. I can't believe it's 8% alcohol, that could be dangerous because they go down easy. Would highly reccomend spending the extra dollars for it because it's worth it. Was always wanting to try it and know I have. Leaves a good finish it your mouth."
"O - I rarely drink Dubbels, but this one was pretty good. Very complex with loads of fruit and a nice grainy bread background. The alcohol is well hidden. A nice example of one of my least favorite styles."
""
""
"Overall: this beer just doesn't suit me. There are several ways to go about a dubbel, and, while this seems a well-crafted beer, it mostly hits each of my least favorite elements of the style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall...I think this is flat and that has impacted the whole beer in a negative way. So I will revisit with another one and update my review."
""
""
"Do not hesitate to enjoy an aged bottle of Pere Jacques. It certainly improves in my opinion."
""
"O: A solid dubbel that makes great use of the malts, yeast, and alcohol to make a nicely simple yet complex beer. Not as complex as a few Belgians, but still nice. Dangerously drinkable as well. Worth a drink"
""
""
"O: This beers was continually evolving as it warmed up and the more complex flavors came into play. It was a little too sweet at first to me but then it got a bit cleaner in the finish as it warmed and settled. A nice dubbel from Goose Island and very good fresh and I expect will age well too."
""
""
""
""
""
"I would drink this one again...If I find another one I might age it for a year or so in anticipation of even more flavor."
""
"Overall: This is a pretty solid brew. The 8% ABV is well and the drinkability is also pretty good. If I come across another 2010 version of this I'll probably buy it again. I recommend it to those who like a good, $3.00 a bottle dubbel."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: fruity and slightly sour, quite delicious"
"O: A little sweet but definitely fits the style. I'm really enjoying this brew, sweetness makes is a good beer to take your time with and savor. Great looking beer that smells even better. A definite must try if curious about Dubbels. I'm curious to see how it will age as this was a fairly young beer. Again, good job Goose Island."
"M: Medium bodied."
""
""
""
"WOW, what a great beer! Poured a very hazy amber with a nice 3-finger head. Head stays for a while and leaves a decent amount of lacing. Smells very fruity. Not too much though. Just the right amount of sweetness and malts to make it a wonderful sniffer. Very sweet tasting at first. Nice and malty with hints of grape and raisens. On the finish it smoothes out and the alcohol really shines through. Nice bubblegum taste in the mouth. The mouthfeel is very smooth with a nice amount of carbonation. Hops abound the aftertaste. Very drinkable, especially considering the high alcohol content."
""
"Overall a very tasty brew. Need to try a fresher one again now to see the difference. Not the most amazing dubbel from the US but a contender."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"[O] Just a hair above average. A fine beer but doesn't resonate particularly well with my palate."
"22 ounce bottle, bottled on 07/30/11. Served in a goblet, the beer pours a reddish/orange color with about a half inch off-white head that didn't stay around for very long. There's a small amount of lacing. Aroma is nice, it smells like dark fruit, bready malt, and some caramel. Taste is similar to the aroma, but there's the addition of some nuts and toffee. Mouthfeel/body is medium/full, it's syrupy and slick with moderate carbonation. Not a bad brew overall, I'd buy this one again. $7.99 a bomber."
"O: I had this beer a week ago on tap (when I was thirsty) and it knocked my socks off. The bottle is a little less impressive but still a straight down the middle representation of a good Dubbel. As with most bigger Belgians this beer finds its sweet spot (pun intended) as it warms a little in the glass. I just wish I could drink it slow enough to get there."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - I think its a good balanced beer. Not really getting any hops but I wasn't expecting that. Mostly malt but its balanced out with the dark fruit. Tastes a little lighter than it looks."
""
"O: a pretty good brew, deffiantly better then my initial reaction to it. Overall a solid dubbel."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Taste is lightly sweet berries, iron, whole wheat bread hint, caramelised white-bread crust (like Nut Tree white bread - a personal reference probably meaningless to most). It is smooth and flavourful, well-rounded, engagin, highly enjoyable and easy to drink - excellent."
""
""
""
"O - For a 8.7% Dubbel this brew drinks really easy and could get dangerous with not a trace of alcohol on it. A rather nice refreshing unique dubbel that comes in unusually dry. A must try for a fan of the style because its unlike any that I have had so far. Cheers!"
""
""
""
""
"O: an interesting brew from the first of a trilogy of the aged Belgium Style Ales purchased yesterday."
""
""
""
"Very nice medium bodied beer. Easy to drink. I am glad I tried this one."
"A descent drink but no their best."
""
""
"Overall – A quite decent and rather easy drinking dubbel. Give it a go if you have the chance."
""
"This pours a medium brown color with a slight off-white head. Scent is mostly that of toasted malts with some sweet, nutty tones. The taste is rather bold and complex. The yeast and malts create a unique toasted flavor that is caramelized and dry with a touch of sugary sweetness. With a lot of flavor to the taste, this makes for a good sipping beer."
""
"D - Nice! I like this one a lot, one of goose island's best."
""
""
""
""
""
"Bomber from Let's Pour. Pours a beautiful amber red color, hints of purple, with a nice big cream colored head. Smells of dark fruits, plums, figs, apples. Flavor explosion of figs, pears, and some other dark fruits (prunes/raisins/). Mouthfeel is light-medium. No alcohol presence and very easy to drink. Excellent beer."
""
""
"Personally : 4"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O/D-Not my favorite style. I am very inexperienced with the style too. This one doesn't have anything that jumps out to me. Bland."
"The beginnings of a nice beer. Definitely need to mature in the bottle. Going to put the rest in the cellar and break open next year."
""
""
"O: Pretty tasty dubbel."
""
""
""
"This is a super complex Belgian brew that's pretty drinkable and tasty. Overall a decent balance, where I feel others lack in this category. Recommendable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall I really like the strong yet soft presentation. It's hard to compare it to Belgium counterparts since it's not as complex but it was an overall enjoyable drinking experience."
""
""
"Whatever - this was a letdown. Not the best domestic dubbel - certainly not bad - but not praiseworthy."
""
""
""
""
"O) So you want to produce a ""Belgian""??? Well, tough category with of ocourse, real Belgians to compete with. Pere is a good beer. I would have liked more carbonation as I found this beer too flat. I'll try it again and revisit my review."
""
""
"O - Enjoyable but could be a lot more with more flavors and mouthfeel. Would have again."
""
""
""
""

"a very pleasant surprise for a boring night without internet or tv. very tasty, very sweet."
""
""
""
"This is really nice, I find it a bit on the sweet side, but other than that is true to the style. I would recommend this beer, it shows some nice complexity, and while not as refined as some belgium dubbels, it is worth trying out."
"O- Not all that impressive. I'd take one if offered, but I won't seek it out in the future."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"D-very tasty beer, lots of dark fruity sweetness. hints of hop bitterness to balance the big sweet malts and a huge syrupy feel."
""
""
""
""
"This is an interesting dubbel. I'm glad I finally bought a bottle. I think I'm going to have to buy another and age it to see what happens."
""
""
""
""
"O - The high complexity makes this one a bit hard to drink more than a few. The alcohol is well hidden and gives the brew just a pinch of warmth throughout. I would be happy to return to this one, granted it is not one I would enjoy on a weekly basis."
""
""
""
"Ommegang Abbey is cheaper and better. This tastes like that but with 20% water. The aspects of a great Dubbel are there - fig stickiness and an addictive tannin-like leathery bluntness. It just lacks punch. The booze is there ... but I don't drink Dubbels for the booze."
""
""
"O- A decent dubbel for somebody looking to get into Belgian Ales. Nothing over the top good, but a decent beer nonetheless."
""
"Overall, I'm unimpressed with THIS bottle. I wouldn't have cellared this beer had I noticed it was a screw top. On the other hand, I can tell this brew SHOULD be great. I'll just have to get another one and try again."
"O- This is a great Dubbel. I think its on par with many of the Belgian ones I have had. Only this one is cheaper and more accessible than any rivals."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: 3.5"
""
""

"A very nice, balanced flavor with good sweetness. Refreshingly clean finish with just a bit of a sticky linger. A good all-around dubbel."
""
"I don't remember the last Dubbel I had, it was probably Affligem (because it was cheap at the time but it was good). But this beer, was sort of an eye opener as far as Dubbels go. Aroma took me completely by surprise for a beer I bought months ago and pushed to the back of the cellar. The taste follows through very nicely from the aroma and it's quite drinkable. Basically this beer reminds me that I need to expand my pallete (however you spell it) and try some more dubbels as well as buy some more of this to age!"
""
"Overall- no strong aroma or finish, but the beer is very well balanced."
""
""
""
""
""
"Very good. Tasty, balanced, drinkable... Can't complain. One of the best dubbels I've ever had."
""
""
""
"O) Wondering a bit about the storage prior to my obtaining this, as some of the tastes should have been bolder and they seem faded. Decent effort, I think."
""
"Pours a murky copper color (similar to apple cider) with a meager tan head that disappears in short order. Aroma is largely of caramel with some alcohol and a mild fruitiness. The caramel malt dominates the flavor profile, though the considerable alcohol is even more pronounced than in the nose. Some Belgian yeast, dark fruit, and vanilla can be found as well. The carbonation could be a little higher to help augment the sweetness, but this is a minor grievance. Dubbels aren't exactly my favorite style, but as far as dubbels go, this is pretty good, though the alcohol could be concealed a little better. Goose Island continues to demonstrate a skillful hand at Belgian style brews."

"O - Decent dubbel from Goose Island. Reminds me of an old ale in some respects, particularly because of the heavy malt presence and vanilla notes. Still, this is a tasty brew worthy of repeat purchase."
""
""
""
""
""
"I couldn't believe that this was only average in the alcohol department, as I could feel the booze well before I finished off the contents. This servring was bottled back in May but like others on here, I'd love to get another and let it age for a while. While this wasn't cheap, it was worth what I paid for it and I'd certainly give this another go in due time."
""
"O- The combination of the dark fruit, yeast, and light mouthfeel make this an excellent beer, and very approachable."
""
"O- A very good domestic Dubbel. Not as big on flavor and aroma as some of the top scoring examples but priced right. I would serve this without hesitation."
""
""
"Pours a deep copper color with a decent sized beige head that quickly dissipates to a cap. Smells of brown sugar, caramel, dark cherries, raisins, and prunes with a nice melanoidin thing going on. The flavor follows the aroma quite well. Dark sugars and fruits with burnt raisin thing going on. Medium body with a light level of carbonation and a sweet slick mouthfeel. I was worried that I had sat on this one too long, but it all worked out. Nice brew that reminds me a bit of an aged barleywine or a dopplebock. Maybe now I should try a fresh one."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"An excellent example of a Dubbel. Complex, elegant, sweet and chock full of candy-coated dark fruits. The alcohol is deceptively hidden. Another score from Goose Island on par with St. Bernardus Prior 8!"
"I was hesitant in cracking this one open after holding onto it for so many years, but it seems to have aged great. A nice year round offering from GI."
""
"I usually don't like this style and that's why I put drinking this beer off for so long, but this is one of the few rare ones that really works for me. Glad I always kept thinking about it. More win for the goose."
"Overall: A pretty solid American take on a Dubbel. Could of been a little more yeasty but the fruits were very good."
"A great experience from my first Goose Island brew. One that foments the seeking of more goodness from this bunch."
""
""
"O-nice dubbel. I'm excited to see goose island doing some more elaborate beers. deinitely going to pick up another bottle to age."
""
""
""
"This beer poured out as a deep brown color with a very little amount of head on top. The smell of the beer is sweet, it's a little yeasty too and really quite inviting. The flavors of candi sugar, and fermented dark fruits swarm the mouth on this one. There is a very subtle bitterness in the finish but this tastes much nicer than a lot of Dubbel's I've have in the past. The mouthfeel isn't too carbonated, it's a heavier/thick beer than I expected too. Overall I thought this beer was really quite good. I would drink it again."
"I enjoy dubbels a great deal, and I certainly enjoyed this. With a little bit of tweaking, or possibly some aging, this would really be sublime."

"Pere Jacques pours a deep, unpolished mahogany. Maybe two fingers of cream colored foam crown the beer, but head retention and lacing are far too brief and clean, respectively. The nose is fantastic, lots of plum layered with other dark fruits. A little bit of pepper and clove come through as well, just enough to keep things interesting. Unfortunately that nose doesn't fully translate to the flavor profile, as the estery portion of the beer fades rather quickly, just a flash of sweet plums and raisins. The dominant phenol profile is a bit less spicy than in the aroma,very little pepper and just a lot of clove. The body is suitably light, but the carbonation falls dull on the palate. Dubbel is one of my favorite Belgian styles, but Pere Jacques is just a bit off."
""
""
"Would pair well with lighter chocolate, plain unsalted nuts, and grilled pineapple."
"O: Definitely a good beer; an excellent dubbel. Will be interested to see how the bottle in the cellar ages and compare."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- this is a 2012 version so I will say this much... Keep these amazing brews coming. Again, I don't have access to much goose but wow I am impressed with another great beer from them. Don't change a thing about this brewery please!!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Very drinkable, easy to sip on this all evening. One of the better selections from Goose Island."
""
""
""
"Impressive. This has superb balance, with the flavour/aromas meshing perfectly. The body is fantastic, with creamy smoothness and restrained carbonation. A hard beer to fault, yet I can't help getting the impression that something small is missing - the malt not quite dark or rich enough perhaps. An element of depth is absent. Nonetheless, this is a top tier brew that is very tasty and well worth sampling. Grab one if you see it."
"O: Definite must-buy. I will revisit this beer every time it comes out into my local store."
""
""
""
""
""
"Not hugely overpowering, so a more drinkable beer for summer."
""
""
"O - haven't had this (fresh or aged) in a while but I'm happy to have tried it when I did. Doubt it'll improve with more time but it developed nicely over 7 years!"
"Pours a murky honey brown with a beige head that settles to an oily film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, dark fruit, and brown sugar aromas. Taste is the same with some slight herbal flavors. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer with some nice aromas and smells."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Mine says 8.7 ABV and 2/20/12. Poured into a 20 oz Duvel tulip. Pours a deep amber, with a huge off white head, that leaves some lace. Smell is clove, dark fruits, banana, brown sugar, and marshmallow. Taste is similar clove, brown sugar, and dark fruits are the main attraction. Body is large, nice amount of life, not dry, and easy drinking for what it is. Not a Belgian fanatic, but this is very good."
""
"Notes: Kind of bland. Not bad flavor wise, and it delivers the dark sweetness and fruit but I just don't really want to drink more. Decent, but there are so many better beers and Dubbels."
"O: A sipper and a decent dubbel with nice belgian flavors the only downside is the alcohol aftertaste is a little harsh."

"O- I think this beer rocks and should get more credit. Really good."
""
""
"Served on draft in a goblet. Lace quickly dissipates, but the color is nice-almost garnet. Good carbonation and distinct banana something I found interesting for a Belgian Dubbel-style ale. Not a particularly long finish, but a nice malty sweetness. All in all, an enjoyable seasonal from these guys."

""
""

"The mouthfeel is medium bodied, well carbonated, with a slightly dry finish. The bottle states this beer can age up to 5 years, but is drinking just fine after 10 months of cellaring. Overall, a really nice Belgian ale, and a solid sipper. Could hold up fairly well, but this is nice as is."
"Pours a nice ruby tinted amber with one finger of head that recedes slowly and leaves no remnant of its existence. The smell is a nice balance of bready malts with a touch of caramel sweetness and just a touch of belgian yeast esters. The taste is more of the same, the caramel and the yeast character combine with a touch of alcohol to give off a nice okay vanilla flavor. The mouthfeel is a bit syrupy but not in a bad way, it really coats the mouth. Overall this is a really interesting dubbel. The oaky vanilla almost implies a light barrel aging but instead seems to come from the ingredients themselves. Overall I would definitely try this one again, especially fresh if I get the chance."
""
"pours a cloudy redish color with a very active rising white head. has that funky sourish yeasty smell to it, and an overload of malty sweetness. flavor is interesting, if a bit out of balance. not sure id call this a proper dubbel, more of a belgian style amber ale. caramel malts conflict with the tart yeast and the result is not amazing like the matilda. plenty of residual sugars around as well. the most dominant taste to me, especially on the front end, is unfiltered fresh apple cider, which is fine, but im not confident it belongs in a dubbel. feel was good though, robust carbonation lightens it up a bit, and a fairly full body for the style is appreciated here. overall a slighly off attempt in my book. the other beers in this series are far better, but the fruity tones make an interesting autumn feeling drink."
""
""
""
"The beer was poured from a bottle into a snifter, and it appears a dark, ruby-brown coloring with only a hint of filmy coating on the surface of the brew. Aromas of rich, layered sweetness, including dates, raisins, plums, and a slight sugary highlight. Flavors are light and slightly sharp on the crisp body, and lead off with a tangy, slightly sour sweetness with all of the fruit profiles blending together. Earthy notes accent all of the sweetness to keep it from cloying. The beer transitions to a darkly sweet, rich aftertaste of roasted sweetness. A smooth, rich finish that stays light, with an increased carbonation. Decent, and fairly easy to drink."
""
""
""
"This was a sweet, medium-bodied dubbel. Easy to drink."
"On tap at South Park Abbey in San Diego. Served in a Leffe globe. Decent foam on the amber brew. Nothing special, overall. I have not had this for a few years, and it seems not to have made an impression on me then. For some reason, the Matilda tasted really sensational to me on tap last time."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"M-very heavy and syrupy. flat so not my fav but I will pretend it is more carbonated as I am sure it was at one time. past it's prime on this one."
""
""
"D: I’d swear this was aged in bourbon barrels. If it wasn’t, and this developed this character on its own . . . Then wow! Not super complex, but very rich and tons of depth. Not super Belgian, but it has enough of the expected aspects. Highly drinkable and enjoyable with a well disguised abv."

"O : very nice , . really enjoyed this one..."

""
""

"Served in a tulip glass, a mostly clear, golden brown with a finger's breadth of fluffy white head; decent retention and lacing, ample streams of bubbly carbonation. Aroma of bready yeast, bubblegum, banana esters, dried fruits. Taste was a little off-putting at first, with perhaps just more earthy funk than I expected. Otherwise, thick sugary sweetness, yeast, raisins, pears, overripe bananas. Medium mouthfeel, pretty chewy, a decent drink overall, but not something I'd want to drink regularly."
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured a brief whisper of a head which vanished immediately. The body is a hazy apple cider appearance. There's not a lot of smell to it but there are hints it may taste of malt and dried fruit and voila yes there is some in the taste but not nearly as much as the Belgian originals. Although I respect Goose Island tried to replicate the Belgian experience alas in this sample they fell far short."
""
"O: Good dinner beer. One of the most drinkable GI brews I've had, a nice dubbel."
""
""
"This is a decent American take on the Belgian dubbel style. My only complaint is that it lacks the depth that I want in this style. It's good, but not exceptional."
""
""
""
"Overall, I think it is a pretty good dubbel. Easy to drink and quite pleasant. Definitely worth a try if you enjoy Belgian ales."

"Overall: A, sophisticated and restrained"
""
""
""
"Had a 2011 Bottle of Pere Jacques and it was a decent beer. The appearance was a clean amber with vitrually no head or lacing. The smell to me was one of apple wine. The taste had an almost barley wine zeal with apple balance. The mouthfeel was lighter in body with minimal carbonation. Overall it was better than I was expecting and it seemed to grow on me."
""
""
"2010 bottle, properly cellared. Poured into a Caracole small snifter. Pours a medium to dark coppery orange amber. Half finger fine off-white head and lacing. Nice continual carbonation keeps a thin head active. Mild aroma of dark fruit and caramel malt. One year has mellowed the flavor to a pleasant well integrated blend of dark fruit, sweet and caramel malt. The hops have largely attenuated, pleasant light oxidation elements. Medium bodied with some creaminess. Very nice, more of a dubbel flavor now than the original. Side-by-side with a 2011. The fresher bottle has more intense flavors of fruit and hops, this older one more integrated. Both are very nice."
""
""
""
""
"O-Besides the poor appearance a nice Dubbel."
""
""
"DOA"
"Overall: keep drinking more, definitely not enough. Let's be honest the goal is to find it so you can keep handy in your fridge...Salud!"

"A fairly good beer and one of the more complex Abbey Ales that I've ever had."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A very nice Belgian dubbel. I think it will be better when the malty sweetness diminishes with age a bit."
"I did a little cellar cleaning and decided to crack one of these open. I had it fresh at a beer tasting and bought some to put in my cellar. It's a nice beer, but I think I liked it better fresh. The next time I make a conscious decision to put an abbey-style ale in my cellar for a year or more, I'm going to make it a real abbey-style ale. Still, this stuff is not bad."
""
"single finger head with a little retention and nice lacing on a brownish amber hazy body. Very nice dark fruit, brown sugar and cinnamon aroma, near perfect. Flavor is a nice musty dried dark fruit mostly raisins and fig with caramel and brown sugar notes. Medium body and moderate carbonation with a semi dry finish. Overall a very good beer. More on the belgian dark strong side. Wish I could get this one in florida."

"O: Very enjoyable. One of the better dubbels I've had. Going to set one down for a few years and see what happens."
""
""
"Pours a dark amber color, with reddish highlights. A very bubbly one finger cocoa head in my snifter glass, very uneven. Fairly clear in appearance, even with the darker color. The smell (rated to style) is very weak. I get earthy malts, and a slight hint of caramel, and small amount of spice. It's really on the weak side, almost watered down. Fortunately, the taste is better. I get Belgian yeast, caramel, dark fruit, malt, and mild spices. It's just a little too 'clean' tasting for me, compared with the best Belgians dubbels. The feel is very light, little carbonation, and goes down very clean. I'd like a little more meat in the feel. Overall, this is a good dubbel, but there are better choices out there to try. Cheers."
""
""
""
"This is an okay beer, I wouldn't go seeking it out, there are better dubbers out there that are far more complex."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Good, sweet and tasty"
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall the flavor is a little one-dimensional, maybe also a little too sweet. Lacks complexity and depth. There are plenty of other better dubbels out there to choose from."
"Pours a medium brown with some red highlights, good solid cap of foam, diminishes into a circle in the middle of the glass. Scent leads with sweet notes of toffee, light breadyness and hints of fruit like cherry and raisin. Taste a touch more aggressive than scent, bready but sweet with notes of toffee and caramel, fruity with splashes of cherry, raisin and plum, hint of spice from the yeast. Medium bodied, moderately bubbly, despite the sweetness, somewhat dry finish. A nice take on the style from GI."
""
""
"mouthfeel is ridiculous. super smooth, not too carbonated, tastes like something god has in his cellar. superb!"
""
""
""
""
"O - I liked this dubbel but it never wow'd me at any certain point. I thought it was good and true to style throughout but never excellent."
""
""
"Pours a clean deep chestnut/mahogany with a thin tight bubbled lace for a head. Strong brown sugar on the nose, plums, figs, raisins. Bitter sweet dark fruits on the tongue, very bready and dry. Sweet sweet sugary flavors swirl around the mouth. Medium to full bodied, low carb, sweet with a great dry finish. This is a good dubbel, nice balance and complexity, very juicy sweet and dry."
""
"Taste is pretty smooth and as expected for the style, more caramel and toffee, same as aroma. A little lighter in texture than others and a bit too hot in the finish. Nice beer, not exceptional.."
""
""
"Maybe a touch too carbonated but pretty smooth going down. A solid offering from GI, and glad I got to try it!"
""
"O: This is a really good take on the Belgian Dubbel. It is a good beer to sip on, not only because of the alcohol, but also because each sip brings something new to the palate due to its complexity."
""
"Verdict: In all honesty I don't think this beer really benefitted from aging. It's still a good beer and was pleasant to drink, but not overwhelming and a bit over hyped."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Well done, pretty decent brew with some age on it. Was it worth waiting 18 months? Meh, not really."
"o - a well crafted beer and very enjoyable. not quite as exquisite as some other abbey styles that i have had (like st bernardus 8), but that won't stop me from picking up more of this."
""
"Overall - A nice dubbels and one that will make me revisit the style more. I have never been a huge fan of dubbels, but this one gives me reason to reconnect with a previously discarded style."
""
""
"Passed on from my brother. Cloudy, dark brown pour with a medium sized tan head. Smell is sugary, with a caramel and malty smell sticking out. Toffee sweet and bready. Dark fruit and yeast really stick out in this beer. Not something to drink a lot of but enjoyable overall."
""
""

"O - This has a lot going on with the nose and flavor profile. These are mostly good things. The alcohol come through nicely in both the aroma and taste and balances out everything else that is going on."

" The flavor is similar, with notes of candied fruits and crusty bread. It's pleasant but heavy on the palate, and with a strong alcohol kick (8%), this one's a sipper. I like Pere Jacques, but wonder what it would taste like with a few years of aging to smooth it all out."
"O- This brew really grew on me as it warmed. The more subtle notes of caramel and toffee started to come out from the year of aging and really helped to round the body out. Honestly, I've never had this fresh, but I can't imagine it being better than this 1yr old bottle."
"Mouth: Sharp, tight carbonation, but not too much of it. Medium heavy body, syrupy, sticky. Drink for dessert."
"Overall, a very drinkable take on the style. I'd like to compare this vintage with a fresh bottle to see how the carbonation and head retention differ."
"A good one."
"This was an acceptable dubbel. I enjoyed components of each category, but together this isn't anything special, particularly when higher quality Belgians are available (from Belgium) at a similar price point."
"It's more one delicious beer to come from Goose Island."
"Overall - Really flavorful and rich, and still easy to drink. More malty then most dubbels, and that adds to a change of pace session beer. WOuld be a great beer to age, but still good to drink fresh."
"I like it. Of all of the dubbles that I have tried so far it's currently the best intersection of price, availability and quality. I plan to keep a 4 pack of it around pretty much all the time."
"Overall I really enjoyed this beer, imagine it would age very well, excellent dubbel. Perfect for a rainy night."
"Overall a nice Belgium Ale, with an 8% alcohol level, is a have one and enjoy and move on"
"The mouthfeel is leaning towards the heavier side with carbonation being moderate. Overall it was a very good beer. The malty, caramel and dark fruit flavors were very nice in it. A very good version of the style and a nice beer to sip on this evening."
"Overall- There is a good beer in here, I just think it is going to take some age to get it to come out."
"O- Not the best I've had for the style, but better than I expected."
"O: I really like the taste, even though it is a bit one dimensional. It manages strong malt flavors and balanced yeast flavors without off notes. Fix the appearance and perhaps add some hops to add spicy notes and we have a Westmalle contender."
"Overall Drinkability - Pretty mild, unchallenging for a dubbel. I wanted to love this beer, but it just has too much stiff competition in the style."
"Maybe a candidate for aging, the sugars might mellow out making this thing drinkable."
"O: A nice dubbel with surprising flavours given the relatively muted smell profile."
"O- wow, what a find! I really enjoy dubbels and this was a great example of the style. Really smooth and pleasant to drink."
"Overall a very complex and enjoyable beer. The richness and strength make this a sipper best shared. Very well done Abbey Ale by Goose Island."
"O: Overall this isn't a bad beer, but it is not my favorite. I probably need to try this one before I've had an IPA, but still the sweetness is more that I like. I probably wouldn't buy this regularly, but I'm not mad that I tried it."
"Disappointing a little to me, as I thought that this would stronger with better flavor, but it was too sweet and bordered on sour like a warm red wine cooler; maybe that was too harsh, but I love most of Goose Island's other beers and this was a bit of a let down. It was OK, but didn’t blow me away. I’ll try it again next year when the next batch is released."
"Good Dubbel. Complex and tasty."
"Overall it's a good beer, but I'd rather take a true Belgian dubbel. It's decent, but I don't know if I'd buy it again. It'd be interesting to try aged longer."
"I am definitely a fan of this one and have had it numerous times at various stages of aging/freshness. Would love to grab a 4 pack and stash it in the cellar sometime, just haven't gotten around to it yet. I'm not the hugest Dubbel fan but this one grabbed my affection from the start. Simply put, delicious."
"It was good, but honestly, if it sat on the shelves at my local beer station, I would probably pick something else up."
"overall, I like this beer, but prefer it a little more fresh. I have had it on tap a few times and prefer that. The flavors in this 2009 seem a little muted. Now I gotta get back to the bottle store and get a fresh one to compare. I gotta remember to check dates next time lol."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, good kick, good representation of style, not sure if the age has contributed to the how prevalent the sweetness is, but it seems like this beer is a Dubbel/Barleywine hybrid, overall it’s a decent beer worth drinking for a while."
"Mouthfeel - medium to full bodied with a bit of slickness that is perfectly balanced by ample carbonation."
"O: A good beer, though not at the top of its class."
"o- belgian dubbels arent really my favorite style, but i like to revisit things. and i want to try reviewing different style beers as well. overall the appearance and mouthfeel were the stronger points of the beer. personally i got alot of licorice and dried fruit, which i just dont enjoy. i understand its part of the style of beer. a good take on the style, and a well crafted beer. just not my thing, will like to revisit again once they are aged."
"Seems like a pretty standard american interpretation of a belgian style. A very enjoyable beer but nothing out of the ordinary for the style."
"O: What a complex beer. Amazing. Easily the best Dubbel I've had so far. Being my first aged beer, I am very excited for all the other beers I have aging."
"D: great dubbel. shitty pour/bottle handling are my biggest complaints. overall great aroma and flavor."
"Probably quite good for the style, and a good sipping beer, although I wouldn't seek it out again."
"D: Smooth, warm, and wet."
"Pours a see through amber. Very nice smelling. Belgian yeast is very noticeable first and foremost. Smells like a caramel apple. Light hops. Taste is similar. Love the yeast. Very fruity. Dark fruit. Slight tinge on the finish. No dryness. Mouthfeel is light and moderately carbonated. Thickens up a bit as it warms. Solid beer overall. Just became one of my favorites from goose island. Hopefully not just in time for AB to kill them."
"O: A pleasant take on the style. Only have one in the house, but would gladly have another if it were here. Would likely buy it again."
"They were pouring the 2010 vintage at Julio's Belgian Fest on August 14, 2011. The color was a medium to dark amber with a nice, foamy head up top that lingers for a spell. The aroma was surprisingly sweet and while Dubbels can be sweet, this seemed a bit like overkill. There was a vague hop note on the backside. Except for the sweetness it seemed fairly well-balanced. The body was medium. The taste was also a bit more sweet than I might have liked and there was little to the finish. A slight letdown but not bad."
"Smell & Taste - The aroma is spicy, including cloves, with malts but not sign of hops excepting a slight bitterness that is largely overwhelmed by both sweetness and tartness. Dark fruit aroma abounds but is even more pronounced in the flavor. Lightly earthy with hints of cinnamon, raisins and root beer. Plenty of flavor, and more complexity than my first impression indicated. I'd like to try an aged bottle down the road."
"O: found it to be an incredible representation of the style, not as intense as i had expected and much smoother than anticipated, two thumbs up here"
"O = glad i found this, never have heard of or seen before so i bought a 4 pack..i wouldnt put it with a Rochefort but not that bad all in all. Will get again and share with buddies who respect the craft beer."
"I mistook this beer for a lighter Saison-style just by the front label alone. I was so anxious to try (what I thought was) a fresh Saison, I got a little concerened when it poured such a dark color. Of well, it's 90F outside, but I'm inside where the A/C is kickin'. So, a warming Belgian-style dubbel isn't so out-of-place after all. Great rendition of the style. Kudos to Goose!"
"Price = $3.25 at The New Beer Distributors (NYC)"
"Carbonation was lacking & it was a bit watery. Felt like it needed more body to substaniate the intense flavor of this dubbel."
"Salud!"
"Overall I thought this was an OK Dubbel that was slightly above average. I thought this beer was going in the right direction but there were too many things that made it rough around the edges. I thought it was weird that the aroma had such a dominating spice aspect to it but when it came to the taste the spices take the backseat to all those sweet and fruity flavors from the malts. I felt that it was just a touch too sweet and the alcohol could have been hidden better. What I liked the most about this beer was its nice and complex aroma and what I liked least about this beer was its high amount of sweetness and how much the 8% showed up. This beer doesn't have good drinkability it took me a while to drink the whole bottle and it was a bit of a struggle towards the end, I would never want to drink more then one of these. I don't think I would buy this again, it just didn't impress me, I would much rather have the Dubbel from Bridge Brew Works. If Dubbels are your thing you might want to give it a try, but don't expect to be wowed. This has been the best beer I have had from Goose Island, but that still doesn't make it a good beer, I have come to grips with the fact that I am just not into this brewery, but their line of Belgian beers always catches my attention, maybe I will give some of their other beers a chance but with their track record I doubt it."
"I enjoyed this beer. Would have preferred less sweetness and a little more carbonation."
"One of the better American interpretations of the style."
"Overall an average dubbel."
"Notes: This is a good brew but to me it reminded me quite a bit of an old ale with a Belgium twist. And in that regard, while pleasing, it did not quite do it for me."
"Overall I’m glad I had a chance to try it, but I’ve had way too many better dubbels then this one. If the carbonation level was a little higher I bet that this brew would have tasted less sweet to me & I would have most likely bumped this up the overall from 3.5 to a 4."
"Overall, what we found to be the most exciting aspect of this brew was the way that all of the flavor components blended together. While it had sweetness, as well as serious malt activity, the two were married in the most harmonious fashion. It can be easy to sway the entire flavor profile towards one way or the other with a dubbel, but this beer finds a gorgeous balance."
"D - good flavor, but a bit too sweet for me, it is easy to drink but i'll stop at one"
"O: Pretty decent, I feel like the raisin/date flavor is a tiny touch overpowering but otherwise this is quite a nice dubbel. Alcohol is a little too present in smell and flavor despite the relatively low ABV. Not too bland like dubbels can be at least."
"O - Overall I think this might be one of my favorite Belgian style Ales. I really liked the caramel and nuts in the flavor and aroma, and the feel of the beer was great to me. The only thing that would get to me after about 15oz of it would be the sweetness and the alcohol taste, but not too much. I definitely recommend this one to Belgian beer fans. Cheers!"
"The taste vaguely reminds of red wine, minus the rich malt character. Some pepper and clove from the yeast. Again, lots of grape, date and kiwi. The finish is malty but alcoholic and gives the sensation of menthol. Overall, a bit overwhelming as far as alcohol, body is thick and flavor is intense. at 8% ABV, i'm surprised that the alcohol isn't better integrated in this beer."
"Pours a ruddy amber with orange hues, dirty white cap lingers long after a gentle pour. Smells of brandy, tangerines, dates, spiciness, candi sugar, light fruit. Taste is brandy, caramel sugar, dates, raisins, sweet breadiness. Not excessively spicy which is something I appreciate and don't enjoy much, a plus for this one. Mouthfeel is thick yet smooth, carbonation is medium with large slow bubbles; afterfeel is surprisingly clean and smooth. There is a nice melding of flavors here, pretty high residual sweetness but it is well balanced with alcohol, very friuty and malty as advertised, I must get some more of this stuff to age."
"o: enjoyed the bottle very much, would definitely have more, I would say it is right in with style and better than most out there."
"Bottle from 2009. Typical dubble color and an atypically dull aroma that lacked anything dubbly. The taste, however, more than makes up for the flat smell: loads of dried fruity Things, leather and an old rope or two. Lively body with a good amount of fizz but not overly so; piles of sediment at the end which I know people say you're supposed to leave in the bottle, but that's stupid-- drink the schmutz. You'll be much happier for it. Let's hope that the recent acquisition of GI by AB-InBev doesn't ruin the beer or the brewery."
"It pours very dark brown with some reddish notes and a light brown head. Nose is fruity brown ale, but the taste is a step up from that--incredibly complex, with layers of toffee, nuts, dark fruits, brown sugar, allspice, rum, apricot. It's on the sweet side, I suppose, but has so many layers of sweetness--and a healthy amount of spice--that it's a really great beer for dessert. I imagine it would also pair well with cheese or with a warm loaf of bread. The mouthfeel is really creamy and full, with a spritely carbonation that keeps it from weighing you down. I'm going to go rush out and buy myself some as soon as I finish writing this review."
"O: Really good beer for the style and I would definitely get this again. It's easy to find in upstate NY and fairly price. Nothing I would ""crave"" however, so I won't be rushing out anytime soon and grabbing more."
"Overall- Great beer all around! Drinkability was the only downer, and was very full afterwards. I'm hoping I can get my hands on one of these and age it for a few years. Very good quality brew and one of my favorites from Goose Island!"
"Malt: 2-Row, Wheat, Caramel, Rye Flakes, Special B"
"Not overly complex but easy-drinking (alcohol completely hidden), quite tasty, and a good value."
"Pours a dark, brick-red/amber. An off white head rings the glass. Smell is of caramel and rich malts, as well as some dark fruits. Taste is clean and spicy. A bit of earthiness, and a warm toastiness all the while. A sweet and sticky after-finish lingers, along with some pleasant hop bitterness. All in all, a very refined and tasty dubbel. Very good."
"A very good beer with a amble ivory head and a nice amber clear color. Aroma is slightly floral, but not overwhelming. The mouthfeel is warming in the mouth with a slight thickness and a creaminess. Sweet taste with hints of cinnamon and nutmeg. Went well with my very hot wings at Croxley's Ale House in Franklin Square, NY"
"Couple fingers’ worth of frothy deep tan foam, dimples a lot due to the presence of many larger bubbles, nothing special about the retention, lacing comes in wide sheets but too slick to stick. Light redwood reddish brown in color, good brightness given the depth of hue, loosely organized but active bubbles percolate throughout, clear until you start pouring the bottom of the bottle. Hard to imagine the being sweeter, loaded with caramel, chocolate, toffee, brown sugar, molasses, prune, fig, plum, cherry and apricot fruit, orange marmalade, bubblegum, candied nuts, on the hops side has pine and flowers, nothing too biting. Full-bodied and on the heavy side, the carbonation has the texture of cotton candy, more gluey than lifting. In spite of this there’s more room for more focused clove, ginger and pepper spice, quinine and earth. This forestalls the eventual onslaught of caramel, toffee, molasses, maple syrup, chocolate and so on, the orange to lemon citrus retains that syrupy and candied character. More yeastiness here with that bubblegum to banana touch. Plum, fig, date, cherry, apricot, peach flavors, nice mix of darker and lighter fruits. Booziness elevates as it warms, more rum notes and feels like it goes to your head faster. One glass is really all you need. (Bottled 2/26/10)"
"the cpj"
"O - Certainly a solid beer, but not my favorite dubbel nor the best of the Goose Island offerings."
"Pours a murky, dirty brown with a slight rosy hue around the edges. It's unfortunate that the first impression is Pere's less-than-attractive presentation/color, but it's all uphill from here. The smell is like holding a fine cigar right underneath your nose, and the taste is of rich tobacco and sweet licorice. The live yeast, while adding to the beer's cloudy pour and murky looks, holds its own in the flavor profile. While it did some work over the past 2 years in the bottle to continue the fermentation process, there's still plenty of residual sugars that linger. Overall, another excellent Goose Island Belgian Style within the truly elite lineup (Sofie, Matilda, etc.)"
"Once again, an American version of a Belgian style that is far too sweet. Well done, but does not talk to me."
"O- Really enjoyed this one, excellent representation of style. Beginning to enjoy Goose Island with each of their beers I try."
"O: I wish I could get some of this to celllar for 2-3 years. This is a superior dubbel with dark fruit qualities that are top-tier and drink as smoothly as any Belgian dubbel I have had. I like malty Belgians so this one fits my likes as well as any brew in the style. Great job Goose Island."
"Cheers."
"Narrative: He twisted the tuning keys backstage, hearing the crowd chanting and awaiting him to open with his new hit single. However, the only thing that he would provide, would be a soft melodious performance. His fingers lithely fingering the fretboard with threadbare precision. Mediocre in style but with precision in the mediocrity."
"O/D - Probably the tastiest Dubbel I've had to date. Very drinkable, very tasty, very aromatic, and I would love to have a case of this for home."
"O- Excellent American Dubbel, definitely worth a try if you see it."
"5/10/13 update: Back to this beer after 2 years in the cellar...Similar appearance as the freshie but with plenty of sediment. Aroma is a hint sweeter. Ripe grapes predominant now vs. the initial caramel toasty malt character. The taste is like the aroma. Heavy on sweetness which covers up the alcohol bite that was initially present and no astringency here either anymore. The mouthfeel has definitely gotten thicker with just a bit of cloying sweetness. Still plenty of carbonation here. Overall I think this beer has improved with age as it is more like the good Belgians. I'd give it a solid 3.75 now. Glad I held these as I didn't care for this beer fresh. Probably time to drink more. I think it's at it's peak and about to become too sweet and cloying. I'll hold a couple to see."
"O: I really liked everything about this dubbel. I may have to start buying this each time it comes out. If you’re into dubbels, Belgian beers or malt, check this one out!"
"Overall, it's almost as expensive as a fine Belgian dubbel and not quite as good, so it doesn't make it into my fridge very often. However, it is a respectable beer as far as Belgian style beers from American breweries go."
"Mouthfeel is meduim to light. I'm torn about how much I care for this one. It's a bit too sweet for me. Driknkability is about a 5 or 6 out of 10 for me. Prosit!"
"O - Overall I really enjoyed this beer, it had some interesting flavours I wasn't expecting. A touch sweet but still solid. Definitely looking forward to my other bottles."
"Overall this is a good beer, not great but very good. Too sweet to be considered a true Dubbel but I really don't care about style to be honest."
"O - This is far better than I remember it being on-tap. It is, in fact, one of the best Dubbels I've had."
"D - Nice drink; I the love the job Goose Island has done with their supreme line of specialty beers; the triple attack of Matilda (favorite), Sofie, and Pere Jacques goes unmatched for consistency and flavor; could make a great dessert or after dinner beer as well"
"Texture and taste were quite complementary--sickeningly sweeet and sticky to the max. Quite frankly the absolutely worst beer I have ever tasted. I will not come this way again and will avoid the style in the future."
"O: the more this beer warms up, the more I love it. This is usually the way with Belgians and Belgian-adjacent beers. I wonder if this axiom holds true with Belgian people as well? If you are looking for an American Belgian-styled beer that is not too funky, yet has a tremendous amount of flavor and attitude, I recommend this."
"Heavy and flat for a dubbel, so more a sipper. But a nice one at that - surprisingly fruity top notes. Begs for food. Has the big round body that comes from giving a beer some age, so I'm glad I waited."
"Drank this cool not cold, just below room temperature, and I feel that the temp really exposed a lot of the layers of the beer. Rich and complex, but not overly ambitious or pretentious. A fine outing from the gang at Goose Island. Cheers."
"Here's to Greg Hall."
"Overall: One of the better sweet beers out there."
"I've had better and worse. Would like to age one for a year, though, and re-review."
"Great aroma, and good flavor, though the flavor is a bit one dimensional, so I have to knock it there a bit. Still, very yummy."
"Mouthfeel is full and chewy."
"This looks and tastes better than most belgians from belgium. That's worth something. The biggest competition for this may be from other domestics. Well done."
"This was much better than I remember it being two or three years ago. Maybe the best American version of the style I've had."
"D - I was reLly impressed by this offering from goose island. This is easily the best dubbel made on this side of the pond that I have had the pleasure of trying. I had this with about 11 months of age on...I could see this going for much longer. Highly recommended!"
"None of the flavors are overbearing which makes all of it's complexities understated and interesting while working well and in tandem with each other."
"A little too sweet and boring with a strong boozy finish. Not a bad beer, just not a great dubbel."
"D: This is extremely easy drinking, but the boozy smell does translate to a boozy feeling, and with 8% ABV that makes sense a bit. I probably wouldn't want to have more than a couple of these. Price wise it's a pretty good value, so I would probably buy another bottle or two of this to cellar and see how it changes over time. Wouldn't go nuts with it though."
"Another hit from Goose Island."
"Drinkability: I'm really liking this brew. Dubbel's really haven't been a style that I frequently drink, however this one may have changed my mind. I'll be picking up some more of this the next time I can. Cheers!"
"D -- A decent brew, while a touch out of balance on the sweetness there are a lot of good things going for it. Worth a try, if nothing else but to compare to their other offerings."
"Drinkability: A good solid dubbel. Not as classic as a true Belgian but at half the cost per bottle...something I would drink regularly."
"Again, served a little bit colder than I like, but a tasty take on a dubble nonetheless."
"D: Moderately drinkable, but not too enjoyable due to the overwhelming sweetness, syrupy mouthfeel, and total lack of carbonation. Probably my least favorite of the Goose Island offerings I've had."
"Appearance is reddish brown with a small head. Smell is a mix of bread, dried fruits, sweetness as well, like caramel. Taking a sip of Pere Jacques, it it tastes of malt, more dried fruit, some hops, brown sugar. MF is a bit like syrup. Pere Jacques drinks good, this is a nice dubbel, one of the better ones from the U.S.."
"Drinkability: Very easy to drink. Little to no alcohol presence whatsoever. Lacks in the taste department but everything else is great."
" Drinkability is high on this, there is no taste of alcohol and it is very smooth."
"M/D: pretty creamy for a Belgian, still pretty fizzy though. Easy to drink with zero alcoholic burn as it goes down. Not as interesting or complex as I remember from previous sessions with this brew, but still a solid offering!"
"Good beer, but not seasonable."
"Not too rich, decently smooth. With a spot of food could be easy for another."
"Way off-balance, with the hot, dry alcohol becoming a definite turn-off. Man, I was really looking forward to this one, too! I'm having a hard time getting through the glass I have, & kind of dread the idea of another half-bomber waiting for me in the fridge. I'd be willing to try this again sometime, but this was not a pleasant experience."
"DB- Pretty solid for an American take on a Dubbel. The only thing that gets to me is the growing presence of alcohol flavor with time but it still remains enjoyable."
"Bottle. Bottled on 07/14/10. Poured into a tulip glass a slightly hazed copper orange color with a thick, fluffy off whtie head. The aroma is a very sweet cereal type with some fruit type esters like pear and some spice, I am sort of wishing the nose had a more pronounced aroma as it is rather subtle. Medium mouthfeel. The taste is sweet and malty with an aftertaste of belgian abbey flavors along with some breadiness. Nice lace as I drink this down. Ends rather dry with a lingering boozy flavor. Decent."
"D - A solid and satisfying malt bomb... Not the best Dubbel, but one I would gladly recommend and seek out again in the future... Hides its 8% ABV fairly well... Deeply satisfying..."
"D- I really enjoyed this beer. GI is producing some great Belgian style beers and this is another one I like."
"Dark amber in color with fragrant spicy notes. Upon first pour there is definite carbonation, but the foamy head quickly subsides and the pint glass resembles a glass of root beer. Appearance does not impress. First taste is slightly sweet but a good mouthfeel, that carbonation is definitely present when drinking. After taste is a bit overwhelming with the ""alcohol"" taste, but it is a high abv belgian and I bet this gets much better with age. The bottle was filled only 6 weeks ago so it hasn't had time to mature yet."
"Very drinkable family beer (over 21) ! Great with cheese, pasta, burgers, you name it! Had this with Pizza and Chicken wings. This was the 2010 vintage. I realize they change every year, slightly though. But as long as God, the Pope, and Pere have any say in this beer, it's going to be astounding no matter what year! Cheers!"
"The flavor matches the smell well--sugary with some alcohol warmth. Very rich body with an equally low carbonation--almost chewy. The aftertaste is reminds me of toffee. There's an element of fresh baked biscuits."
"D- is high it very well made"
"Looks and tastes more like a Brother Thelonious (but better) than an Ommegang Abbey."
"D - Good Goose Island beer. Not my favorite style and have not had many dubbels. But a good beer, maybe only one for a sitting, and a bit on the sweet side."
"Coppery/bronze color. Poured a bit thick and a lot of sediment. Small head on top. Heavy, buttery aroma-traces of fruit and almonds. Quite malty flavor wise. A bit boozy. Fair amount of fruitiness. Very sweet for the style. Decent mouthfeel-the heavy sweetness really lends itself to being almost syrup like. Overall a nice beer. I tend to think the sweetness and sticky body would get to be a bit much."
"pours an amber color with just a slight off white head that disappears rather quickly. smell is of caramel, belgian yeast, and alcohol. taste is slightly metallic-like, more caramel in the malt. some dark fruit. mouthfeel is flat and medium bodied. drinkability is decent. this isn't a mindblowing beer, but a solid, yet different dubbel."
"Poured from the bottle a deep amber/copper color with a bit of the sediment and yeast from the bottom, the head is a nice thick pillowy off white that disapated into nice lacing for the remainder of the beer. The smell of this beer is quite pleasant dark fruit fig, cherry with a good bit of malt and earth. Taste is very similar to the smell raisin fig cherry upfront with a good sweet brown sugar and malt backbone wiht a finish that is slighty dry and yeasty. Mouthfeel is smooth and light not as creamy as expected but still very clean. Drinkabily for this beer depends on the drinker I found it to be a nice complex belgian that could use some tweaking but did leave me wanting more, and for a high ABV it hides its alchohol well."
"""Contains live yeast. Sediment may form."" Yep. But that's expected with the style. Pours a reddish amber with plenty of sediment floating about. Thin head is gone quickly. Nose is caramelly malt, molasses, apples, raisins... a faint whiff of alcohol. Carbonation strong up front, crisp and malty. Sweet throughout - from the caramel malt to the dark fruit to the bready aftertaste. Slight alcohol bite. Mouthfeel is medium to light. Drinkability? One and done, but a good dubbel."
"Very similar to the 2009, slightly less cloudiness. Very similar malt and yeast profile, caramel, raisins and dates. Yeast complexity a bit subtler. Still quite good."
"We just call him Pappy Jack. Anyway, it pours a hazy tawn' topped by about a half-finger of ecru foam. The nose comprises cinnamon, clove, and nutmeg. Frankly, it borders on a pumpkin spice aroma, but something's missing from that formulation overall. The taste also leans toward this pumpkin spice idea, but adds some banana and cedar, allowing for some of the Belgian character to really shine. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a kinda dry finish. Overall, a pretty nice dubbel, but not something I can rave too much about. To me, there's just not enough Belgian quality for me to really feel all dubbel-y bubbly about it."
"The aroma has a rich, malty sweetness that only comes about in aged barleywines and Belgian beers-- it is partly the good kind of oxidation. Flavor is full, complex, again very rich, and without a hint of alcohol. Overall this easily becomes a great dubbel. Just great."
"D: Pere Jacques has aged well! A very solid dubbel with nice complexity and ample carbonation. This one won't blow your mind but its very solid in every aspect. A good sipper during any time of the year."
"D - It goes down easy, and nothing prevents me from wanting more."
"D: Out of the specialty belgians from Goose Island, I would go with one of the others."
"Overall, another solid offering from Goose Island here."
"Very good rendition of style here. Extremely drinkable and tasty. Not too heavy or cloying but very full of flavor."
"My sample is the 2010 release. This beer pours with a hiss of carbonation in the glass that settles fairly quickly. The smell is sugary and grainy. Mouthfeel is coating and slick. Flavor profile is somewhat fruity with just a hint of spice in the background. Overall this is a very sweet dubbel, though not cloying. It masks the 8.00% ABV very well. Given the syrupy mouthfeel and the relatively high alcohol content, this is a one-bottle treat."
"The taste is a bit bland, as there really aren't any complexities showing through and there is just a generic dark malt and fruit combination without much more there. Mouth is a bit creamy on a medium body. Drinks okay, but this is a bit less than the type of Belgian-style ale than I expect from Goose."
"nice medium bodied mouthfeel; medium, appropriate carbonation. smooth and drinkable. recommended."
"Overall I thought this was a decent Dubbel, but seemed somewhat subdued compared to many others."
"It's almost like a wine, and it hangs in the mouth. I dig it, but it's not one to drink a lot of. Would be a bit much. I bet it's great paired with the right meal though."
"NOW time to get a case of this and throw it in the basement."
"D: Very drinkable for the strength of the alcohol, but nothing that really sings or is that inviting. It's intriguing. There are some very good flavors here, and it's like the best ones are hiding under the surface. Maybe another batch in the future, but for now, my imagination is better than the actual product."
"other bottle develops in the next couple of years."
"D - very nice example of a classic Belgian dubbel. Very flavorful. Skillfully balanced. Makes me want to seek out more of the goose island offerings."
"O - The price is on the level of better examples of this style, and I'd have to say that I'd probably turn to the belgians before this one again."
"Overall: This is the second time I've had this beer. The first time I drank it unaccompanied at room temperature. The 8.0% ABV was painfully obvious and made it slightly difficult to finish. This time I enjoyed it slightly chilled with a full dinner (spicy pasta alla carbonara and Greek salad) and the flavours of the beer were perfectly complimented and balanced by the meal. Trust me, accompany with this with a full-flavoured meal, it is an entirely different experience!"
"Pours a tree bark brown with a about a half inch head. Smells very much like a dubbel. Really not much to write home about except that it is a good attempt at making a belgian style dubbel. It is very drinkable but does however feel very sticky in the mouth. A good session beer nonetheless. A little pricey in my opinion and is probably my least favorite from the series."
"D - Quite a surprising little beer that was a pleasure to drink. There is a slight alcohol presence, but nothing that slowed me through the bottle."
"Poured on a pint glass and it had an amber brown tones, along a yellow medium crown. A little foggy on the glass. Nice carbonation, nice body. Sweet malts on the aromas along with some raisins, fruits and some floral hints. Pretty much the same taste as on the nose with very little alcohol present. Which is nicely concealed in the explosion of flavors due to the light yeast."
"The body of the beer is medium, and the carbonation is lively. There's a creamy texture and a bit of booze in the finish. It's a drinkable and enjoyable beer, but it lacks the personality I'd like. A bit more character, spices from the yeast, and alcohol masking would make this a much better beer. Still worth a try for any Belgian beer lover."
"D: Good to very good."
"Pere Jacques was orange-brown in color and a little hazy. It had a short beige head that didn't last terribly long with very little residual lace. The smell was sweet malt and yeast aromas. The taste was malty with some fruity yeast flavors and spices with some alcohol becoming noticeable towards the finish. The finish was dry and lingering. The mouthfeel was good; with a medium-full body and nice carbonation, sort of creamy. Drinkability was good. This is a good Dubbel and is definitely worth a try."
"before I notice, the glass is half empty, so it must go down rather well. a tad boozy, but not excessive for the ABV. A decent American take on the Belgian style, but for the money, i'd take an authentic."
"Pours a reddish brown with some copper highlights, thin tan head with fine bubbles. Sweet malty nose with notes of toffee, caramel, red fruit and banana. The palate is full bodied loaded with sweet malt flavor accompanied by red fruit, nuts, baking spice and banana."
"d - I think this was a very good, malty, dubbel. Lots of fruity and bready malts, but it makes it very easy to drink for 9% ABV. Looking forward to drinking the other bottle of this I have."
"Wouldnt want to drink a bunch of these - too sweet, and a little unbalanced."
"Poured from the bottle into a snifter with a dark caramel-mahagony color. Ample head of an off-white color that dissipates quickly. Smell has a spicy nature with a very malty background. Taste is similar witha bit more spiciness. Feel is quite carbonated a a but on the dry side. Overall a good beer which I will have again with the opportunity."
"Poured from 22 oz into chalice, clear and mahogany in color, some beige head. Retention and lacing minimal. Smell is of candy sweet malt with some booze. Taste like lots of sweet malt, some caramel. Some ripe fruit, lil raisin. Mouthfeel was full but smooth. Overall a good beer but nothin great especially when compared with others in this style."
"D - Drinkable enough for the style; but I find the finish slightly off-putting, though not quite cloying."
"Even though this beer is named for a modern abbot, Pere Jacques is a worthy carrier of its 1945 namesake, who hopefully will become more well known as a result of the tribute this beer provides."
"Very disappointing brew. Ill try again just in case I had a bad bottle."
"Very easy to drink with rather syrupy mouth feel. Alcohol is well hidden. This is a good tasting beer. I will be interested to see what the 2010 version tastes like....or will I age it?"
"jd"
"Picked it up on a whim. Poured a very thick amber brown with a somewhat tan head. Very cloudy liquid with a continual stream of small bubbles rising to the surface, which keep a small ring of foam around the edge of my glass after the head has gone. Smell was very mild and nothing I noticed about it stands out. Taste was almost too sweet but with a small taste of hops at the end. The malts didn't stand out for me. The mouthfeel was pleasantly thicker than I expected and fairly smooth. Over all a decent enough beer, I just didn't find the same feel other posters here have. Tastes more American than Belgian to me, which is OK. I agree that this is one for sipping, but nothing wrong with that, is there?"
"D - Overall this is a good beer it has a good taste thats easy to drink the only thing that wold make it better is if the body was fuller but its still worth a try sometime"
"My favorite of Goose Island's belgium beers, but not a beer I'll buy every year. I have one me bottle I'll save for the 5 year mark and maybe I'll pick a few more up then. Good stuff worth a try especially if you're like me and want a spin on a style you're not a huge fan of. Without a doubt improving with age."
"D - This is a solid brew, one I would certainly recommend. I have always had respect for GI, but go to their website and check out the video about this brew. It'll give you a whole new perspective about both this brew and the brewery."
"I just opened a bottle dated 3/8/08, with the same labeling at the sample picture. It poured satiny smooth with no head at all and a rich, cloudy dark amber. It featured a massive amount of sediment, which didn't take away at all. The smell was subtle and of candied fruit, and slightly sweet with slight alcohol aromas. The taste was exceptional. It was both yeasty and sweet, somewhat like candied fruit. The mouthfeel was extremely smooth with little carbonation and had a medium body. The aging definitely smoothed this one out quite a bit. This was exceptional at almost 2 1/2 years old. The Pere Jacques is a top notch Belgian Dubbel."
"2010 bottle. Pours a caramel brown with hints of dark amber, and an off-white head. Nose has some holiday cake aromas that lead me to anticipate something sweet with dessert spices. On the palate there's a toffee-bready sweetness up front along with some of those holiday spices I was anticipating. Medium body and modest carbonation lead to a sweet finish that has a bit of alcohol warmth."
"The pour is a caramel/amber color with a very slight head. Perhaps using caramel as a color descriptor is a product of the smell, which is rich in caramel and dried dark fruits. The figs and raisins really show themselves in the taste along with vanilla and again a touch of caramel. It's really malty and sweet. I was hoping for a hint of banana or some bubblegum, but it was not readily apparent. Felt really nice with some decent viscosity. I'd like to get another bottle to have sit around for a year or so to tame the booziness, but this is the only one I've got for now."
"O: Same as before dont drink a bunch of these"
"M/D: Full bodied, carbonation is low. Very drinkable. I'm really impressed with this beer. Maybe not as complex as you might expect from a Dubbel, but very good."
"Poured into a Duvel Tulip and produced a nice fluffy off white head. The color was solid brown with amber/red hues when held to the light. The scent was fruity, with raisins and a bit of apple and some nice direct malt sweetness. The flavor was malty and rounded with just a bit of toastiness and deep fruity plum/raisin flavors. A little bit of a crackle of spice is evident as well. The carbonation is lively spirited and the beer finishes just ever so slightly dry and a medium body. A pretty competent version of a Dubbel, but it doesn't stand out in any real sense."
"D- this is a deep brew. Very layered and complex. I love the way it paired with these cheeses and was just a lovely drink."
"D- Decent, but it is pricey and did not strike me as anything special for the price. I'll try it again, if I ever run across it, in the hopes that I got an off bottle."
"Pours a beautiful ruby red brown color with a restrained head that gives off nice lacing as it dissipates quickly. Smell is delicious dark fruits, figs, cherries soaked in bourbon, ameretto cookies and biscotti comes through. Burnt caramel and raisins too. Taste is very good. Has a lot of booze on the backend, but ,asked a bit by the quality of the dark stone fruits. Semi dry finish but has a sticky sweet aftertaste. Mouthfeel is a tad high in carbonation. I would like to see this a touch less carbonated. Also a bit thin on the palate for me though the flavors are still there. Drinkability is decent as well because it's delicious but the thinness of this is just not appealing. Still great and would reccomendstions."
"Beer poured a reddish brown with little head. Nose is bready with dark fruit and hints of vanilla. Taste is dominated by dark fruits and vanilla rum. Just enough hops there to keep the sweetness at bay. Mouthfeel is good, nice viscosity and smoothness; would love to have a bit more carbonation. Drinkability is good. This is a nice representation of style, glad to have tried and would sample again if the opportunity arises."
"Picked up a 12 oz bottle from Princeton Liquors labeled 2010. In the light, it's a beautiful ruby red with a dash of amber. The aroma smells of caramel syrup and dates with a hint of rum. That same juicy flavor continues, but there's no syrupy feel. This Belgian is light and drinkable for the style without being too thin. It also hold hints of clove and vanilla under the date and rum raisin tastes. Overall, this is a damn fine beer. Check it out if you dig dark Belgians."
"Even though this ale is a healthy eight percent alcohol, I was surprised at the heat following its smooth mouthfeel. I also found the Pere Jacques to be lightly carbonated for this style as I was expecting more of a Champagne feel, but neither of these factors adversely impacted this very enjoyable brew. By this time, I should have known to expect the unexpected from Goose Island; they haven't yet let me down."
"If you are in the distribution area for this beer, it may be the best American example of the style. Balanced with a deep malty nose, spicy and smooth. It lacks the complexity of the pillars of this style, flows across a bit flat and unexciting, full bodied and rich with a sold drink-ability. If you were held to the American side for dubbel's this would be a solid choice but there are better ones out there from Belgium of course."
"Overall-solid solid Dubbel, unique, doesn't knock it out of the park for me but I enjoyed it, worth a try."
"Drinkability: it's a sipper, but a good one."
"Let's just say 'Belgian' Doppelbock, shall we. Given that I can buy Chimay Red at this price all day long, I don't think I'll be revisiting..."
"D: Overall, this is a very drinkable beer, it is a easy sipper for the ABV. Also the flavors are all very pleasant and are blended nicely. I will buy more of these to age and see how they develop with time."
"A very rich and drinkable dubbel."
"december 2011 and it was still thick and rich, dark and sweet. certainly had not lost anything, though I am not certain if it improved either. not disappointed; recommended."
"D - Very drinkable. Each sip is very enjoyable as there are a lot of flavors to explore in this beer. I would recommend aging this one as I tried a 2007 Pere Jacques recently which was phenomenal. I hope this one ages just as well."
"Not a big fan of this one. It is not that complex and too phenolic. There a bunch of dubbels out there that I would buy before this one."
" ~ This is a great beer. I appreciate drizzam's hospitality tonight with this offering. I have a bottle I'm cellararing. I plan to drink it in the year 2014. I'll be sure to invite drizzam."
"D: Between the heat and the syrupy feel, it's a definite sipper. I'd be curious to try it with a bit of age on it, but there are better dubbels for the money."
"D: this was actually a very tastey dubbel but I'm really glad that I had it fresh. I enjoyed the flavor a whole lot and will definitely try to get more."
"D - Very drinkable considering the alcohol content. Due to the light carbonation its syrupy goodness chock full of sweet malt. Drinking this while I eat a steak. Goes great with it."
"D- Pretty easy going and fun to drink. I haven't had too many beers of this style, but it is tasty."
"D - A little cloying but nice. Second time I tried this and its scored improved."
"D: This is true to style, but something seems to be missing. I like it, but don't love it. It is an excellent way to finish off a night, good after-dinner drink. I am not sure I would reach for another immediately following this one, but I will definitely have another one in the future. Worth seeking out."
"D- The boozy nature of this beer makes this one a little hard to put down, but still drinkable. I feel like this could become better with some age on it."
"It's a little too sweet to be really drinkable for me. I crave a dry finish in my belgian styles and this is the opposite of that. I feel like the FG is way too high, and I have been rather disappointed with the entire line of Belgian style beers Goose Island has done. Their yeast choice is likely to blame."
"Edit: Going back to this, I see that Goose Island themselves call this beer a dubbel. Only the ABV differentiates this and a (great) quad."
"D: A little disappointed following the Sofie with this. Both are Belgians from GI, but Pere Jacques seems a little amateurish. Smell is faint and flavor is not as balanced. Looks great and comes in a classy bottle (now has a different label in the style of Sofie). However, at $7.50 a bottle, I expect better."
"okay for a dubbel, but more on the belgium strong ale side for me."
"D: Goes down ok, definite kick to this beer, sits somewhat heavy in the stomach and a touch too sweet. It's an ok dubble but not one that I would have again."
"T-- Very fruity. Acidic. Has a ciderish aftertaste. Well carbonated. Appley in the the beginning, has a slight hop IPA taste mixed with cider. Sweet but crisp."
"Flavor is fairly well balanced, but it's lacking both in malt character and doesn't compensate with fruit esters, instead the off notes carry the day. It's as undercarbonated on the palate as it looks in the glass, and overall, this is just a very disappointing beer. Hopefully just a bad batch."
"Overall - Very impressed with the nose and flavors present. Interested to try this out of a bottle to see how it compares to the draft version."
"A well made Dubbel, me thinks."
"D: This is a fairly good attempt at the Dubbel stlye. It hits most of the marks dead-on, but there is a long way to go if they are targeting the legendary brews offered by the Trappists. This is worth a shot, but I would like to see the price come down a bit for the quality that is offered. For a buck more, I could get some superior offerings from Belgium."
"2009 Vintage tasted from a 22oz bottle. Pours amber with a thin off-white head. Nose of caramel malt, raisins, brown sugar, and some cherry. The flavors are a little more reserved than expected, but similar to the nose with the addition of some banana. The palate is full bodied with medium carbonation, and a medium finish that is sweet. The alcohol is a little hotter and out of balance than I would like, but this is a solid beer."
"I poured this from a 22oz. labeled 2010. It poured out almost like a translucent red wine, not much of a head and no lace. On the first sniff I get fruit (cherry mainly), candy sugar and alcohol. It smells a bit like cough syrup, though a bit more natural. It tastes a bit better than it smells but there is still a medicinal quality to it that I can't ignore. It goes down alright but the taste gets in the way. I love beers in this style and this one just didn't seem to fit on my, ""I really like it," shelf. Sorry Goose Island, I'll still check out your other beers but this one, probably not for a while."
"Overall: The body of the beer is medium and the finish is medium also. This dubbel is just okay there is no character, no complex malts, or rich flavors. I am disappointed in GI. I am glad that I had the opportunity to try another GI, beer. Thank you."
"D: i find this beer a great representation on the Belgian style. This is a winner of a brew in my books"
"Thin texture, carbonation burn. The sweet malt and alcohol presence reduces drinkability"
"D: Flavorful and pretty balanced. Doesn't disguise alcohol all that well, but not overbearing."
"F: Still semi sweet with a hint of bitterness. Lingering candi sugar and raisin with hints of caramelized sugar. Also some lingering Belgian malts and chewy malts."
"Overall it is decent but nothing special really."
"Pours a dark amber color with a thin head that dissipates to a beaded rimming of foam. Lively carbonation evident. Aromas of banana, clove, ginger, vanilla and a whiff of bourbon. Medium to full bodied with a crisp and dry mouthfeel with expressive carbonation. Opens rich, malty and spiced with flavors of caramel and dark candy sugars. The tartness of sour cherries emerge with notes of raisins, vanilla and bourbon that follow. Mild hop bitterness makes an appearance in the middle. 8% ABV begins to warm the gullet. Ends dry and spiced with suggestions of dry wood tannins in the finish. Very good American Dubbel."
"22oz bottle 2009 edition $7. This was a weird beer. I could not tell if it was a dubbel or just a weird belgian strong ale. It smelled yeasty but the flavor had citrus and spice like a tripel but then also raisin like flavors that I get from dubbels and belgian strong dark ales. It was easy to drink but overall I just foudn it to be a bit strange for my tastes."
"D-definitely a nice beer from Goose Island; the 8% is well balanced but the slight acidic tinge is a little odd"
"Poured from a bottle into a large wine glass. Bottled January 13, 2010. As soon as I starting pouring it I got a fruity, cidery smell. Nice translucent reddish color with a small khaki head. Taste is similar to smell, fruity character but not particularly sweet. Dry finish. Mouthfell is smooth with pleasant carbonation. I really like this. I've had this before a lot fresher and was not that impressed. What a difference just four months have made. I look forward to trying this with more time on it."
"overall - very drinkable! so smooth and creamy with a great flavor. I will definitely be trying this again."
"D: Very drinkable. Could easily have an entire bottle of this to yourself without sweetness getting to you."
"D: Too sweet and thin. I've had many better examples of the style."
"the mouthfeel lacked. kind of an overly heavy body, somewhat sweetly astringent. seemed like it had more of an abv. this hurt the drink as well. i wouldnt really want another, too heavy and sweet. sits heavy in the stomach as well. not bad, but the one bottle is enough. i may revisit this in years to come, but im more interested to try GIs other belgians now that ive had it."
"Medium carbonated and bodied. Definitely a solid dubbel."
"A different double, that's for sure. Kind of a German/Belgian malt synthesis to me. Alcohol is very tastable for 8.0%."
"D - This is definetely a beer for sipping with its alcohol level and notes. Beer gets easier to drink as it gets warmer but stil is not something I would have many glasses of in a night. I think it would improve with age."
"Drinkability: It is definitely a beer with a nice level of complexity, but I am not sure if the flavors all mesh together well enough for me. One is probably sufficient before moving on."
"Overall not bad. Will definitely try it again next year. Nice work from Goose Island who has yet to disappoint me."
"Notes: This is a very interesting and complex beer which I think was still a bit young and could use some time to age."
"Overall, it's good but not exceptional. Still a valient effort for an American brewery."
"D: Unlike some other dubbels, I can only manage to sip this beer due to the alcohol heat, although the drinkability slightly improves as the beer warms up."
"Drinkability: A very good American interpretation of a Belgian Dubbel. I like the extra bite of the hops in this one, as it keeps it from seeming overly sweet. Very nice beer to session with."
"2010. Sort of a weak pop when the cap came off. Crystal clear reddish, burnt orange colour (in a Chimay goblet) with a smattering of beige bubbles that formed a thin collar. Not much in the way of lacing, other than a few spots. Just a bit of sediment came out during the last pour. Sweet aroma, brown sugar and bread, toasty, spicy with slight alcohol. Low bitterness, balanced towards malty, sugary sweetness. More brown sugar flavour, toasted marshmallow in the background, lots of toasty malt, a bit fruity, figs and dried fruit, light alcohol and spice in the finish. Slightly coarse and syrupy texture, lowish carbonation, medium to full bodied, hint of warmth. Pretty good. I liked it and would certainly purchase again."
"Drinkability: Good for the style. One per session is the max for me, but I would get this again. I do like the fruitiness that is present here."
"D: This is too sweet and difficult to drink for me because of that. This clearly needs some time to age and mellow out, I'd like to come back to it later."
"D: This is a nice, but not great Dubbel. I'm glad I grabbed it, but there are better examples of this style out there."
"Yeah this is too sweet for my taste and lacking in other areas; however I can see this going down quite well on a particular type of palate. Just not my cup of beer."
"A very nice brew, this one - another great example of Goose Island's art. It's very drinkable for its 8%, and if it does appear slightly too sweet after a while - well, that's what it's for. that's what I signed up for in this beer, and it delivers well on that."
"Overall, I think I like this a bit more than Matilda, another Belgium Ale from Goose Island. The flavor is balanced better and is more full bodied. The flavor is so intriguing, I can't stop drinking this. I would like to expand my knowledge of dubbels, but will recommend this to colleagues interested in the style."
"D - Nice offering and a reasonable Dubbel, a bit on the lighter side of things compared to others I've had of the style. Kind of like a Dubbel crossed with a Saison to me. Could be a decent entry to Dubbels for a hop-head?"
"This is drinkable, but nothing special. It may be a little sweet for my taste, but not bad."
"4.5/3.5/3.5/4.5/4"
"M/D - Medium bodied and very creamy. Light stickiness and the flavors definitely linger. Very easy drinking."
"Some alcohol does show - but not more than expected, and still drinks very well. Sweetish - but balanced. Has a ""Belgian-eque"" flair about it. A well-done interpretation of the style!"
"M/D - Body a little on the lighter side for a dubbel and nicely carbonated, not very high volumes. As mentioned the alcohol flavors are hidden very nicely but it's warming sensation is present. Very smooth and easy to drink...each time you take a sip another flavor develops."
"Overall: Sweet, malty tones develop into some fruity and spicy flavors. This beer is sweet, but the after flavors leave it balanced enough to be enjoyable. Alcohol plays somewhat of an odd role in the aftertaste."
"OVERALL: If you have ever read my other reviews or know who I am you know that I am an IPA man. I love hops, so the Pere Jacques, as a Belgian-inspired beer wouldn't ordinarily be my type of beer. That said, I can recognize quality beer when I taste it even when it isn't an IPA - and this is a quality beer. In fact, even though I prefer IPAs almost all the time there are two occasions that I would opt for a Pere Jacques instead - One, as mentioned above, would be with a nice, rich meaty dinner and two, as an after dinner alternative to a port wine. Truly delicious, makes me a proud Chicagoan. Thanks Bill!"
"D: Awesome for the 8% ABV."
"Tastes like a mix between a Belgian golden ale and a spiced dubbel. Some graham crackery sweet malt with a bit of toffee and toasty bitterness. ABV is well hidden, does not taste like the 9% my label is claiming. A little overcarbonated, I like this one better with a few swirls of the snifter to knock out some of the bubbles. Improves upon warming as well. It is not rich, smooth and creamy enough for me to consider it one of the best dubbels I have had. Serviceable enough though, and fun to try."
"D - Pere Jacques is a really drinkable Belgian-style Dubbel with a pleasant sweetness that doesn't get too heavy-handed."
"To me, Dubbels are one-glass-only beers under the best of circumstances. Lacking the cloud-like feel, I find it a bit of a slog. I will say that it pairs very well with BBQ, though. Worked really well with last night's leftover ribs."
"On tap at Sunset in Brighton. Lighting in the bar is odd but I think color is deep chestnut brown. Rich smell floral, malt, sweet. Nicely complex taste dark fruit, caramel with mildly medicinal aftertaste. Clean feel. Starting to feel this one already, think I'll stick to one but a good brew. Glad goose island has hit mass."
"Light and crisp on the pallate,easy drinking smooth dubbel."
"Taste is a combination of fruit juices: apple, pear, and maybe cranberry or grape. It is pretty straightforward and easy drinking: alcohol is barely noticeable. Flavors are not that complex, but that seems to be the trend for the dubbels I've tried."
"The feel of this beer is a nice light to medium bodied with a easy drinkable feel finish. It goes down well and does not leave you with too much of an aftertaste but just enough to remember the nice flavors left over."
"Drinkability - Easily drinkable though a bit sweet for my liking (to have as a ""session beer""). I could definitely see having a few of these after dinner to cap the night off, however. I had this on tap at Goose Island Clyburn this winter and it was even better then - I think the cold made me appreciate how the beer warmed me up after having it. That and I was with good company! A beer I will forever drink due to past experiences and it being a great after dinner beer which will lead to great conversation. Cheers!"
"Following the Matlida with this just proved to me that Goose Island is no slouch when it comes to Belgian styles."
"d- this is a sipper disguised as a quaffer, for sure. the sweetness might turn some people off, but i thought it was great. i brought this to Wholly Frijoles in lincolnwood for dinner tonight, paired it with roast duck with a maple glaze and chipotle mashed potatoes. great pairing, the sweetness of the beer complimented the glaze and contrasted the savory & crunchy skin. Goose Island knocks another one out of the park."
"A nice beer, though nothing I was blown away by. I like my doubles a little maltier and less fruity. I do look forward to trying the '08 version BigDank gave me as an extra in a few years' time!"
"D: Nice sipper, not sure if I'd want 2 in a row. Great beer on a cold, crappy evening!"
"Cheers."
"In closing, Goose Island remains an enigma, they make great beer (except 312 Urban Wheat, vile stuff), but nothing is at it seems, everytime I crack a new one open, I start looking around for Rod Serling and that big eyeball."
"Overall, the aroma and flavor are complex and inviting as any great dubbel. The mouthfeel is a bit distracting, though - Belgians want to be lighter and spritzier. Nevertheless, this is worth recommending, and worth cellaring, for that matter."
"I wanted to like Pere Jacques, as dubbels are among my favorite styles. However, when compared to Ommegang's Abbey Ale, this beer is left in the dust."
"D - A fine dubble. Drink at will!"
"Like Matilda, this is very solid. A good American interpretation of a Dubbel. Something I would recommended."
"Overall impression- Pretty tasty brew that could be improved with a jolt of carbonation."
"D: This one was just far too sweet for me. It had some nice fruit notes both in the aroma and flavor, but the overwhelming presence of the sugar sort of drowned them out."
"Good Belgian clone. Very drinkable."
"Too thick and alcoholic to drink much of, but not very interesting as a sipping beer."
"I've had this on tap a few times and never got around to reviewing it. This is Goose Islands attempt at a Chimay clone. Some candi sugar's here for sure and the yeast profile is evident in the flavor . A good beer to drink if you are a fan of Chimay grand Reserve. This one has similar flavors. Light lacing that is to be expected from a Belgian style beer. Good flavor without being over the top on clove and coriander flavor as some Belgians seldom are. A well made worthy drinking beer."
"D- a pretty good drinker, alcohol only slightly present, could do with some age however, seemed a bit on the ""hot"" side"
"OVERALL> Very interesting and tasty, and quite easy drinking for a sipper. Very well done and worth seeking out."
"D- Moderately high, went down easy, although I'd have no more than 1 or 2 of these. A very good beer."
"D - This is an interesting, but sadly flawed dubbel. The aroma is complex and it manages to hit all of the right notes, and while the flavor is not as deep or satisfying, it is nonetheless quite good. Unfortunately the mouthfeel is not what it should be, and this is a style that depends more than most on the texture of the beer. It is lacking in both carbonation and dryness, which makes both the malt and yeast seem bulky and dense. This weighs down the finish of the beer and really hurts the drinkability, while it also makes the flavors seem more muddy and thick than they really are. With a better mouthfeel this might have been a really nice beer, but as it is it just taunts me with its unfulfilled potential."
"Stands right up there with any Belgian."
"Drinkability is limited by the ABV and it feels like more of a sipper than making you want 2 or 3 of these."
"D: Awfully complex and it keeps me guessing as what's going on with its flavor. I might enjoy this beer a little more with some age on it, then again with this style it isn't unusual to have the alcohol so prominent."
"Well made, might be a little young still."
"A tasty beer and glad I had the chance to try it. Would love to pair this with food."
"D-Quite good, with some layers of complexity and interesting flavors."
"I just cracked open a 2006 Pere Jacques tonight as I was sitting on here trying to get a trade out of a few of my VE's. I am surprised how well it has aged, the taste from beginning to end was still a sweet one. It went down very smooth for being a 3 year old beer. I look forward to letting my other ones age another year or two..."
"Pours a cloudy, dark amber color. 1/6 inch head of an off-white color. Decent retention and decent lacing. Smells of slight hop, sweet malt, citrus, slight sweet malt, and yeast. Fits the style of a Dubbel. Mouth feel is smooth and crisp with an average carbonation level. Tastes of slight roasted malt, sweet malt, slight hops, citrus (banana), yeast, and alcohol. Overall, a great beer with a good blend, complexity, and body."
"D- The sweetness doesn't become sticky or cloying. The alcohol which weighs in at a decently hefty (especially for here in Ohio) 9% but it is barely apparent. Averagely drinkable but nothing here that will really make me come back again."
"Pours a dark amber with a very creamy head which lingers for a while.. Nearly perfect. Has sort of a bready, fruity flavor that is reminiscient of red apples. Yeasty (in a typical Belgian way, not overly-yeasty). A bit malty and biscuit-like, as well. Aroma is quite faint, really not much to notice at all. Some bread and fruitiness, but very little. Mouth has a decent medium body and light carbonation. It is smooth and fairly-tasty, easy to drink but a bit lacking in areas."
"Long pour into a Trappistes Rochefort glass brings out a nice brew reddish brown in color and leaves a nice off white head that last only a few seconds. Smell is of slight hoppiness and heavy fruit. Taste is slightly bitter / sour with an easy finish and a candy-like after taste that sits well on the palate. Fairly well carbonated it seems for the alcohol level but well balanced and very tasty. I can easily have a few of these in a night but as a preference choose to keep variety. This brewery provides some good beers but the signature selection is definitely worth trying more than once on any type."
"A sipper for sure. On the easier side of the drinakbility scale despite the high abv. A fresh, flavorful, complex Belgian that did not disappoint."
"Especially if this is to last the five years in the cellar the brewers advertise it will. Working my way through the last third of this bomber I'm beginning to get a headache. There is a certain aggressiveness to the beer that couldn't be more opposite to what is characteristic of the style's best. To be perfectly blunt: this is a bit of a mess. It's a piercingly sweet concoction of allspice and alcohol and it is far from this brewery's (or the style's) best."
"Good Dubbel, but I've had better. Don't think I can say it's worth the price though."
"Drinkability: Nice sipping Dubbel that is pretty good for being made in the US. There are better ones out there but this one is certainly worth a shot."
"This is a very taste dubbel. A sweet blend of spice, caramel, fruit, toasted malt, vanilla, and a touch of bourbon flavor in the background, though there is no noticeable booze. Very smooth and creamy mouthfeel. A very good dubbel. I can't remember having a better American brewed dubbel."
"D - The alcohol comes through just a little too much on this one. Combined with a lot of sweetness, makes this one hard to make a session out of, although more hardcore people than me probably would have no problem with it."
"The body is medium to full and the mouthfeel is smooth and rich. Carbonation is light to moderate."
"This beer pours a cloudy amber-brown color. The head is half an inch in height, and recedes slowly into nice lacing. The aroma is of dates, hibiscus, herbs, and yeast. It is a very pleasant aroma, and had some complexity. The taste is like the aroma. The mouthfeel is medium-full bodied with a silky texture, and moderate carbonation. Overall, this is a good beer that I would certainly drink again."
"overall this beer had decent flavors - i had a 2007 fresh bottle a couple years back and remember that one tasting very different - maybe its the aging"
"D- This is a good dubbel. I would liken it to Ommegang's abbey ale, although I'm not sure the comparison is perfect. Relative quality, however, I think is close. I like it."
"D - very acceptable dubbel. not the defineing example of the style, but one of the better American takes that i've had. i am stoked that i have another bottle to try out in a couple of years."
"All in all, a pleasant enough dubbel. Nothing that I will actively seek out again, but it has its merits -- especially in the nose."
"2007 vintage. Poured into a large stout glass. Dark amber with frothy head around the edges. Smell of Belgian yeast, spices and candied fruit. Taste is amplified in the fruit department with apple and pear. Great finish with perfect carbonation. Time has done it justice. Solid."
"Thanks to RomanW70 for sharing this one. 22oz. bottle, 2009 vintage. Poured the color of mahogany with hazy clarity. Thin, white head dissipates into a soapy swirl with a tight, white band around the edges. Nose was mild - malt, sweet, some booze at the back - I also get a little wet cardboard. Taste was malty, with some dark fruit and brown sugar. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied and lively with a slightly oily feeling. Not a complex beer, but a very nice example of the style I have to say."
"Drinkability/enjoyabilty--pretty low."
"Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into my Maredsous chalice. Bottled on 3/18/05. The ale appears a hazed amber chestnut color with about two fingers of off white head. Nose and flavor consist of tart green apples, hints of yeast, caramel, toasted bread, mild banana notes, some dark fruits, a touch of alcohol. Medium bodied with ample carbonation for a dubbel. Glad I had the chance to try this one. I can't remember who sent it to me, but thanks!"
"Dark brown/copper in color with nearly three fingers of head that camps out for a bit then leaves a sticky layer. Smell is dark grapes, apple peel, grass, dandelion. Taste is cat piss, apple peel, and flowers. Medium bodied with a carbonation sting. This one isn't really worthwhile for me, I like my Belgians a little thicker and bolder. Perhaps dubbels just aren't my thing."
"Fantastic double. I'm glad I grabbed a couple bottles of this, since it's not available back home."
"Not my favorite Dubbel style, by a longshot, but good. Goes terribly with anything salty or sweet, have not paired with savory dishes. just snack type foods."
"Final Thought: Goose Island brews excellent specialty brews; this is no exception!"
"a surprisingly complex malt of a beer with a style somewhere between a imperial american brown and a beligan strong. very interest sweet that is masked by the plain nose of breadiness. with agitation comes a candied pineapple and mead aroma. rather sweet but not syrupy. mild dry hoppy. mild earthy malt quality. fantastic for game bird."
"My 150th Review and its summary gives me my mug."
"I can drink this for a while, the alcohol comes through but is not overpowering, a good beer"
"Pours a hazy amber brown with a nice off-white head. Aroma is pleasant with notes of banana, apples, and malt. Flavor is complex and fruity. Medium mouth feel and is well balanced. Once of the nicer dubbels I've tried, and a credit to Goose Island. I'm glad to see recent raters put this one higher as I think it is deserving."
"Goose Island certainly got the Belgian character with the fruity and tart yeast, although they come up a bit short on carbonation, as I expect a much more lively body. I really enjoy the sour/tart flavors that cut through the moderate sweets. One is definitely enjoyable, though I would not want a second in one evening."
"Drinkability- This is a brew which I would definitely have again although it is going to take some practice to pour this brew without getting the sediment in the glass."
"I poured my 2009 Pere Jacques into my beer tasting wine glass. has an ice tea color with a little reddish orange hue. Just a slight tan head. Smells of dried fruit, red grape, slight banana. The flavor is much of the same, add some breadiness and caramel. The mouthfeel is right, not too sticky, not too watery. For a dubbel, this is quite drinkable, although don't go crazy at 9% alcohol."
"BTW... this is a dubbel?! WTF!? i need to revisit a fresh offering."
"2009 vintage, 8% ABV. Pours a dark amber color with practically no head and the thinnest sheet of lacing imaginable. Nice, biscuity, yeasty, aroma with some hints of chocolate, some light grassiness and maybe a hint of ripe fruitiness. Flavor profile is not overly complex, but there a nice mix of dark fruits, a hint of rum and chocolate, booziness, apples and light bitterness on the finish. Sweet at first but turns dry on the swallow. Nothing spectacular, but pretty tasty. Prickly carbonation, but not effervescent, medium body. A decent take on a Dubbel."
"This is a pretty big beer for a dubbel. I think Belgian strong dark ale is a more fitting title."
"D: Pretty good for a Dubbel, I only bought a single bottle because I am picky with my Dubbels and didn't want to waste. But I plan on buying a full sixer of these because I immediately wanted another."
"This is either a bad beer, or it doesn't age well. Like many other beers, I will try this one again, hopefully a fresh one to test my theory. Please forgive me Goose Island, but I know you can do better."
"(D)- The over year of age has made this super silky smooth! The 9%abv is nonexistent and has melded with the brew beautifully, but I am feeling it now that its gone! I think that the actual flavors have become a tad too muted to really keep me interested, but its one of the smoothest beers I have ever experienced! *I want to retry/re-review a fresh one to compare the difference.*"
"Nice to try, but almost reminds me of a fermented raisin puree."
"D- Not a very good example for the style and honestly, not all that appealing. I really wish I didn't have a bomber of this."
"Very good beer and a bit of surprise to me. It has the flavor and aroma of candied fruits. The beer is a dusky amber with red-gold highlights. A gentle head caps it off. It doesn't quite fulfill my notion of a Dubbel, but it's been awhile since my last. The beer is very sweet with a malt flavor that could almost work in a barleywine. It packs a lot of fruit flavors, including plums, grapes and overripe peaches. It's a very nice Belgian yeast strain for an American brewery with good phenols. The beer is right on the edge of booziness, but the balanced sweetness keeps it from going too far. Before tasting the beer, I was trying to maintain some skepticism in spite of my great enjoyment of the BCS. While Pere Jacques might not be quite as perfectly executed as that fantastic beer, it is still quite good in its own right."
"Mouthfeel is very appetizing - just the right amount of smoothness and carbonation. It feels like it coats the tongue and roof of the mouth. Alcohol is only slightly noticeable, quite an achievement considering its 9% ABV. This makes it a very drinkable Dubbel, but it is a little too sweet to be a session beer."
"D= Definitely a sipper but a tasty one. much better fresh and on tap than I have experienced in bottles."
"D - Drinkable for the ABV. Refreshing but a little too sweet for multiples."
"Conclusion: A home run from Goose Island; in 2007 I bought two bottles from this bottling; I drank one right away; this I've saved until now and it is FANTASTIC for its aging. A bit less fruitiness than you might expect from the style, but the malty/toasted/chocolate qualities are absolutely top-drawer. One of Goose Island's best; this proves the quality of their operation. This went perfectly with dried figs and pumpernickel."
"Drinkability: Not too bad, but not one of my favorites of the style thus far. If the flavor was a little more to my liking, I would raise it, but really for what it did for me with a bigger ABV, I feel the need to rank this a little lower."
"D: This is as excellent an American interpretation of a Belgian strong ale. Sweet, yet not overbearing."
"Medium-high carbonation with a nice dryness in the finish. Low bitterness and quite easy to drink. Would love to try this one with a year or two on it."
"100th Beer Reviewed."
"A nearly opaque dark murky brown color body with a medium off-white lasting head . Aroma is bready,yeasty, apples and dateswith some faint clove and bananna esters. Flavor is earthy,malty and spicy/sweet with some apples.rasins,caramel,with just a bit of the alcohol coming through. Medium to heavy carbonation,medium body with a dry finish and mouthfeel. Quite sessionable despite the 9% ABV. Another fine brew from Goose Island."
"Dr- pleasant beer for style."
"Drinkability: I am going to buy more of this soon, Very soon. What a great, full flavored drink. This one has a little over a year on it and I can only imagine how well these will age."
"This is really a fantastic Belgian Golden/Triple ale. All that's missing is the yeast in the bottle. Beyond that, this could be a trappist ale. Honestly this is what I might imagine Westy 6 to taste like."
"Not too shabby. I'm still kind of new to Belgian style beers, but I'll drink more of this in the future."
"Thanks to akokandy for this one in a recent trade!"
"D- A very drinkable beer."
"Feel and Drinkability: Full bodied and heavy with light carbonation. The beer feels exactly as it should. It leaves the mouth with a coating of what I'd say is a slick wetness. The feel matches the flavor and aroma so I've no qualms with it. This is one that I'd consider buying again, though I think that I'd rather go for something more authentic, there seems to be such a difference between belgian styles brewed in the U.S. and those same styles brewed in Belgium. I don't know, I guess for the price-about $10 a four-pack its right....most belgians are at least $12 a four."
"D: Couldn't pack these in, but it's a good ride."
"D-Pretty drinkabile. My thumbs are up :)"
"Mouthfeel has a light carbonation to it. Relatively easy to drink."
"D: The yeast is a little off-putting, but otherwise it's very pleasant. I didn't have any trouble getting through it like occasionally happens with high-gravity beers."
"Notes: The Matilda from Goose Island was much more impressive. This was a bit pedestrian. The beer that was intended to go in this glass (Chimay) is far superior as well. I consider this a very average Dubbel."
"I have no idea what I was talking about in the aroma. This is a great smelling Belgium beer. I also noted the brown sugar taste. And the drinkability is great, but the 9% is well hidden and could easily sneak up on you."
"It feels thick and dark on the tongue, but the carbonation helps lighten it up. I could drink a couple of these. I like it."
"D: This is a bit of a bother to drink - not my favorite representation of one of the styles I haven't figured out yet."
"The beer pours a hazy yeast filled dark red body with a minimal head that is off white. The beer is loaded with the aroma of malts, alcohol and Belgian candy sugar. The taste is full of chewy caramel and dark fruit malt flavors with slight fusal alcohol notes with a backing of sugary Belgian Candy. The beer is sugary with and chewy with candy. It's a nice beer but not my favorite from Goose Island."
"D- I love goose island so this one is ok in my book but there are better examples out there. A better mouthfeel and a dominate flavor could of helped. The 9% could be a problem though. I have to try a fresh bottle top compare, i'll be back."
"** Just getting over a cold."
"Very good brew."
"Re-reviewed October 2011 and found to be much better than initial impressions."
"Pours a clear dark amber/red color with 1 finger of tan head. Average retention and good lacing. Smells sweet, of dark fruits, toffee, brown sugar, and spices with some yeasty bread and alcohol warmth as well. Tastes of brown sugar, prunes, cherries, and lots of apples up front, then caramel, maple syrup, nuts, biscuits, yeast, and alcohol. Medium-full in body and low in carbonation. Smooth and supremely sweet with a lot of apple presence and a warm alcohol finish. A good fruity Dubbel that shows some signs of its ABV, but is easy to drink and a nice dessert or nightcap brew. Don't know if I'd choose this that frequently though over other Dubbels."
"***Had a sample of a properly cellared, several year old bottle of this, and it was absolutely dynamite. Had to snag some more to stow away.***"
"Decent, but nothing great."
"12oz bottle, 2008 vintage. Served in a Duvel tulip. Poured a hazy copper with a finger of off white head. Plenty of carbonation. Lots of sweet malt, fruit and a little spice in the aroma. Flavor is dominated by malt sweetness. Dark sugar flavor. Carbonation cuts the sweetness a little. This didn't really do a whole lot for me. My least favorite of the Reserve series that I have tried so far."
"Overall, I like this one, but I do wish it was bottle conditioned, and less sweet. Too much malt; should have utilized sugar to lighten body."
"5/3/5/2/7 (2.2/5)"
"A nice medium bodied beer that fit the style very well. I have to say that I didn't even notice the 9% ABV as it is masked well by a complexity of flavors and scents."
"The aroma is not stong of rye bread and fruitiness. Flavor is sweet candi sugar, light caramel, spicy and raisins. The beer has very minimal carbonation with a dry finish. I really enjoyed it and I have yet to be disappointed with a Goose Island special edition."
"cloudy amber color with a nice beige head. Nice dark fruit aroma with a sweet taste of candied sugar, plums, raisins and some mild spice. probably a bit sweeter than most belgians, but this did not detract for me. A most enjoyable brew from the goose island folks."
"D - It is really enjoyable. Again you have to appreciate the style in order to really appreciate this beer. I was initially a little upset that I didn't pickup Matilda but this is not half bad for an innocent mistake."
"Just not for me."
"The sweetness and stickiness means one is enough before moving on to something drier and hoppier."
"Drinkability: A good evening sipper or meal beer."
"great flavor here, highly drinkable. but the alcohol is far from hidden in the taste, so it may be a little much for some."
"Notes: this isn't my first time drinking one of these. I originally had one sitting around a campfire with a bunch of others. That was a wonderful experience but not condusive to reviewing. I wholeheartedly reccomend belgians around a campfire."
"Date of 12/28/2007 on the label, poured from a 12oz bottle into a tulip glass. Appearance is a semi-translucent dark coppery brown color with a thin cap of light brown foam that slowly gave way to a moderate ring of lacing. There are are literally hundreds of miniscule chunks of yeast from the bottle suspended in this brew, the appearance is truly unique. The aroma opens with sweet, dark fruit aromas, then fades and sours slightly to reveal the undertones of caramel and sugary-sweet malt. The taste also starts with a huge sugary sweetness, then brings on more of the same dark fruit characteristics following through from the aroma, touches of vanilla with slight hints of alchohol shining through. Aftertaste leaves a light drying effect, with a hint of an oak-barrel flavor. Mouthfeel is velvety-smooth, medium bodied with low carbonation, this washes down with a silken touch that lightly coats the mouth and throat. Drinkability is nothing short of phenomenal, this Dubbel hides its' moderate abv% well and is super smooth and easy drinking with just enough depth that it can be enjoyed without becoming too complicated. A very well made brew, will definitely seek out again. Highly recommend."
"D: This is a ""Big Beer."" I typically do not appreciate the sweetness of Belgian beers, let alone big Belgians. I likely would never drink more than one of these in a sitting but this is a really good beer. It has aged nicely."
"A nice Dubbel. Good balance and very tatsy. Glad I got the chance to try it. Wish it had more body though."
"Wonderful representation of the style. This made me want to find more in the style. GI hasn't let me down yet"
"2007 vintage enjoyed in a snifter at around 50F. Pours a healthy brown color with a tan head. Poor retention. The nose is a bit cloying. Some sweet alcohols, ripe fruits and lots of malt. Taste has a nice piney hop presence and some tart citrus tones to balance it out. Full body is a little thick. Definately a sipper, but a fine BSDA from Goose."
"I wish I'd had a good cigar to go with this. Possibly my new favorite dubbel if that's what it really is. It really reminds me of the Belgian Pannepot, which is a huge complement to Goose Island."
"D- 9% is so well hidden."
"It's a pretty heavy feel, kind of syrupy and there's no carbonation to smooth it out, but that's what I like in a strong beer like this. The flavor keeps bringing me back for more. This was just an all-around good experience."
"This was not bad, but was a little boozy for my taste. Didn't really strike me as a Dubbel either."
"D - This is a pretty good dubbel. I'd like to try a fresher version."
"This brew is a dark amber color with a solid off-white fizzy head and good lace. There are quite a bit of particles in suspension. The aroma is malty with raisin and some acidic nuttiness. It has a nice middle body with good carbonation. The flavor is light clove and lively malt with a mildly warming alcohol at the finish. There's a grapey crispness with that typical astringent Belgian touch. Some straw and nuttiness. Really a decently drinkable brew with a Belgian type feel that I liked."
"I found this one to be very drinkable, had a lot of flavor, without any one flavor becoming too much of a good thing. Another beer I'd pick if I wanted to treat myself."
"Goose Island Pere Jacques pours a viscus honey amber with an initial fizz. The smell is doninant of yeast with pleasant fruit like notes. This has tons of taste. Its smooth and mellow. The yeast and fruits are the dominating flavors, but neither overpowers the other. They are wonderfully blended making it a far better that average tasting beer. Mouthfeel is dense, but gives the feel of fuffing out into a pillow like liquid at the end. There is a moderate amount of carbonation which is well suited for what this needs. Overall this is an exceptional drinking beer. everything is really good, silky smooth, and well worth taking some good sipping time. Ultimately what impressed me the most was how every sip seemed to get a little bit better than the last through the entire glass."
"this beer does not taste very fresh--it was aging in hot warehouse, probably for over a year, reminds me of a sweet bruin aged in oak barrels."
"Pere Jacques is a hell of a beer. What's not to like about this one? Okay...so the nose could use a little work. But, that's about the only complaint I have. Otherwise, this is a really nice dubbel that deserves a try. Recommended."
"drinkability is good. this is a rich and drinkable belgian, in which the APV matches the body without showing itself. too sweet for a session brew, but quite nice for what it is. cheers!"
"Overall, medium bodied. Some great stuff going on, just not quite enough taste or richness to match the aroma. I stick by my previous statement though, it's great, just not as great as the aroma portends. I'm still enjoying it a lot now that I've gotten used to the anticlimax. You should buy it and decide for yourself."
"Drinkability: Remarkable. You'll wish you had more of it."
"Pours a deep clear copper with a small buttery head that lingers a little while leaving a ring and little lacing. The smell is all candied sugar and sweet caramel malts with hints of dark fruits. The taste follows the aroma but is pretty mild in general. The candied sugar and malts are there with some spices in the finish. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with good carbonation and sticky sweet. This dubbel was nothing exciting but pretty drinkable."
"Picked this up at Binny's yesterday, like the Matilda a lot so decided to give this a shot. I wasn't disappointed. Says it was bottled 12/28/07 and that flavor will continue to develop for 5 years, interesting. Color is a beautiful copper brown, powerful beer but not overpowering, nevertheless this is not one I would want to have with dinner on Tuesday night. Complex maltiness with a hint of sweetness. A very good offering by Goose Island."
"Opinion: This is a pretty good beer, and it has a nice depth of flavor. The mouthfeel is a little lacking, and it has a bit of an aftertaste. I think that the beer is pretty decent, but there are quite a few others that I would like to have over this one. After having the Matilda, I had high hopes for this one...but now...it is alright. It is good for an American version of a Belgian beer...but I would stick to the Europeans to try a good example of this style."
"D--For this potency? Absolutely."
"Draft at Goose Island Clybourn brewpub. A clear dark gold, little head or carbonation. Sweet aroma. Flavour is quite sweet, balanced with decent maltiness. The sweetness dominates the tip of the tongue, but I keep waiting for a rich fullness in the mouth that doesn't arrive."
"D- easy enough to drink. i could probably have one more before i had to switch to something else."
"Slide into sweet, darky, fruity. Melodies of plums and figs fill the air. Spicy toffee remains aloft giving way to caramel and sweet syrup. Cute story with an ale confident in its character. Challenging the best never felt so good. America refines recipe and comes out the end of the tunnel triumphant."
"Drinkability: This is a really, really good beer. The alcohol's up there, but the beer's eminently drinkable - complex, tasty, good aroma, great mouthfeel. Highly recommended."
"Nice attempt at the style. I'd love to see more of these."
"Not a favorite and a bit disapointing. I will pass on another one."
"Pours a very nice dark amber/brown color, although with very little head and no lacing. It has a pleasant, malty aroma, with slightly figgy undertones, although the scent as a whole is rather weak. Awesome taste, it has a deep, full, malty taste with great fig (and generally fruity) flavors, with a great sweet aftertaste. For such a higher ABV beer, it goes down remarkably smooth, as well. Great brew!"
"If you can get it, give it a try. I think you will like it. I wouldn't take it over Chimay Grand Reserve, but..."
"Very interesting beer. Goose Island beers are always hit or miss with me. Some I think are great while others, not so much. This one was great. Appearance of this beer was nice, super dark ruby red. Lost a little be it had very little head. The smell was super sweet and super fruity. The taste matched the smell. Super sweet, and tones of fruit. Dark berries and even a hint of citrus in the finish. Mouthfeel was ok, was a little bit syrupy. Drinkability was nice. Overall this was a good beer. Sweet, but complex flavors."
"120z brought back from Chicago. Thanks Daniela. Poured dark ruby brown, see through. I wish it were a little less transparent. Sweet candy aromas and flavors. Very tasty dubble. Alcohol warming apparent and welcomed. Good mouthfeel, nice to sip or swig. Drinkable overall, good to start the night off right. The only real complaint other than the appearance is the sweetness, while it is tasty, maybe too sweet. Over time it may mellow a bit."
"HV"
"Drinkability: This was one of my first intro's into the craft brew life and it's an excellent example of just that, not as thick or rich as some brews but very drinkable even with the 9% abv. With a nice hoppy ale and a saison or pilsner this could make for a wonderful, flavorful night. Very drinkable."
"Drinks easy for the style & ABV, but just so-so as dubbels go to me"
"Relatively easy to drink this one, though the 9% alcohol will keep you from pounding 'em down too quickly."
"Pours a murky brownish color, almost the color of iced tea, very little head to speak of, not much lacing. Smell is complex...sticky sweet malt, lots of raisin and assorted dark fruit, some vanilla and brown sugar...a lot going on in the nose on this one, and I'm digging it. Taste is sweet, but not overly so, plenty of the raisin taste, plum, some caramel, some spiciness....this is really nice. Carbonation is a little low, but the overall mouthfeel is creamy and smooth. This is damn tasty, glad I got to try it!! Big thanks to raverjames for this one!"
"Poured dark brown with scant, quickly dissipating head. Smelled sweet like cherry and a little spicy. Very little carbonation and felt more thick than thin on the tongue. There is a strong wave of hops which lingers slowly fading and leaving slight bitterness and fairly significant alcohol warmth in the back of your throat. I wouldn't want to have more than one of these and really wouldn't buy this again as it is a bit more insipid than what I am used to."
"Kind of an interesting dubbel in that the typical yeastiness/zestiness is absent. I haven't had a dubbel in a while, so maybe I'm just remembering the style incorrectly. In any event, quite drinkable."
"After having a fresh one on draught at GI Clybourn, I would say that this beer improves with age up to about 1.5-2 years. This one is a bit faded compared to the one reviewed just six months ago, and the one on tap was pretty mediocre."
"Pours amber with a lot of lacing left. Smell is sticky malt and light belgium character. Taste is boring, and bland overall with light belgian yeast and malt. I don't understand the good ratings, as it is so incredibly mildly flavored... Mild like the matilda, and just unexciting, but not offensive."
"Drinkability: Very sweet. I'm just getting into dubbles and this is a pretty bold intro. Would definitely try again."
"OK drinkability no doubt this is better on a cold day. I could see trying this again during the holiday season."
"D - drinks quite nice, the effects of time are quite complimentary."
"Pours a clear yet dark reddish-brown color. Lots of visible bubbles rising to the surface. Nice & creamy light tan head with great retention. Light aroma with dark fruits, brown sugar, and caramel. Nice malty taste with dark and slightly sugary fruits. Balanced, but not as complex as some beers of this style. Medium- to heavy-bodied and very smooth with minimal carbonation. Very drinkable with the perfect amount of alcohol, not present in the taste. A very enjoyable and tasty beer."
"Not bad, but certainly nothing above and beyond..."
"D : 9% alcohol? I really didn't taste that and could have kept drinking it."
"This beer pours a deep brown with amber accents with a light tan head on it. I get scents of this beer as I pour it and I get scents of sweet toffee, candy sugar, malt, and a yeasty scent coming to life. It borders on being too sweet, but it is just really a nice nose on this beer. The flavor profile is a melting pot of caramel, figs, plums, and some spiced rum. The flavor profile on this beer is delicious and focuses on the sweet and complex malt profile. The mouthfeel is very full with lots of carbonation that makes this offering quite smooth and refreshing, and for 9% ABV I only barely noticed the alcohol warmth in this beer. The drinkability is superb on this beer, and I am thinking about what kind of food can I pair with this beer."
"i liked this offering and will cellar the remaining bottles until a much later date."
"Im starting to like this style more, but wouldnt throw back a sixer."
"A great match with mustard and bacon. I should really give Goose Island more credit because their craft beers are really fine and reasonably priced."
"Good drinkability for a beer with a 9 ABV. So much taste to it, that it would be hard to drink a couple of these though. Overall, great beer with tons of complex and different great tastes to it."
"An all around excellent beer, expertly balanced, and compliments itself, from the appearance to the taste this beer has an amazing flow. I highly recommend this beer."
"Overall, not enourmously drinkable, at times this beer seems a little on the sweet side, but ver good overall. I would definatly reccommed giving this one a shot."
"Overall I thought this was outstanding. Another quality offering from Goose Island that continues to show just how diverse they can get. I would love to pick up another bottle or two of this one. A nice classic dubbel, with a little extra flare."
"D: Again, both are tremendously drinkable. A personal favorite and one I will continue to come back to year after year. (5/5)"
"Really, really nice dubbel from my hometown brewery Goose Island. I haven't had one of the classics in a while, but to my t-buds this flavor is right there in complexity."
"D-if you are into craft beer i could not seeing not being able to drink this a sipping beer to be sure but its complex flavor makes for a very good beer."
"D: this is definitely a sipper, have one for the evening with dinner, maybe as a nice dessert beer. I would definitely enjoy one with a nice tirra missou or Cheesecake"
"This is a good beer, it just threw me off because it's a little more to handle than most dubbels."
"Pours a clear ruby brown color with a small head that settled into a light ring around the glass. The smell is of clove, bananas and figs; a nice and earthy Belgian yeast. The taste is rather bold; big on the dark candi sugar, clove, banana, and rum soaked raisins/figs. A lightly roasted malt peeks through towards the end. The feel is moderate with fizzy carbonation, slightly slick and boozy, and finishes sweet. The drinkability is great for one and perhaps two. After that it may get a bit cloying, sticky and the alcohol will sneek up on you. Very good dubbel."
"Overall an excellent example of the style. I'm not sure what this is like fresher, but this year and half old version is quite good, and definitely worth the wait."
"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, beer is a very deep red with orange hues and a thin, active head that ends as just a ring around the glass. Smell is malty; lots of juicy fruit smells - apples, pears, cherries, and raisins. The taste is much the same, definitely on the sweet side, but the alcohol seems to keep it from being cloying. The alcohol is present but not dominant. The mouthfeel is full bodied with a minimal carbonation and a dry finish. Overall, this is a great beer, as drinkable as any beer that has 9.0%."
"D - This is an exquisite beer that lends itself to slow sipping more than rapid quaffing. As an after dinner brew or a night cap, this has real potential. It's a little too sweet IMO, but it's a great beer."
"Drinkability is average."
"Poured into a snifter. Pere Jacques pours a rich mahogany/amber color with a short white head that has almost no retention but a ring around the inside of the glass. Light lacing. Aromas were of grapes, raisins, clove and a strong cinnamon presence. Tasting this beer after hearing about it for so long was an absolute delight. Sweet raisins were the backbone of the flavors, with a nice blend of the cinnamon and clove makes this an outstanding dubbel. Mouthfeel is nice, very smooth, not heavy at all. Very complex palate. Carbonation is low to mild. I was shocked when I saw that it was 9%, which is pretty high for a dubbel, you don't get that high alcohol taste from this, which is probably due to the aging. I would definitely love to get some more of this, since it was delightful. Based on style, this could be the best dubbel I have had yet."
"Verdict: A fairly ambitious offering from a pretty reliable brewery. It's not as complex as some of the classics, but it hits all the right notes."
"Overall a nice American Belgium style I enjoy drinking."
"This is easy to like, and in my mind is the second-best beer Goose Island makes to Bourbon County. True to the Belgian style and tradition, this is truly terrific."
"I really need to get my hands on more of this, i need to try it fresh and age some more!"
"Note: Good abbey style dubbel."
"This beer pours beautifully, a deep amber-reddish color with a thick, deep ivory head. Its nose is sweet, berries come through pretty strong. Its taste has a nice malt flavor with berries, a pleasant sweet after taste. It's high alcohol content sneaks up on you at the end. The brew has moderate carbonation, goes down smoothly. However, its strong sweet taste hinders me from wanting to drink more than one. It would be really great as an after dinner brew. I agree with others, this tastes more like a Barleywine to me than a Belgian, but nonetheless worth trying."
"D: Slow sipper but enjoyable. Splitting a 12oz bottle was enough for me."
"Not the best GI offering and wouldnt really put this one in the category of a dubbel either."
"D-A nice shot at a dubbel. Not on the top of my list, but still quite good. Alcohol is not strong in the taste, but strong in the warmth and effects. I still have an obsession with GI Matilda so I would probably go to that when faced with a GI line up. Still, you cannot see enough american made dubbels if you ask me!"
"Had this on tap at the Map Room. Poured a beautiful hazy burnt orange with a good head that fades to a ring that sticks around. Aromas of sweet malt, candi sugar, and lots of fruit- particularly apricots and cherry. Sweet and with a hint of orange as well. The taste strats with more sweet candi sugar, apricot, tangy yeast, banana, and maybe some slight coriander and clove. Delicious, and well balanced. The mouthfeel is smooth and sweet and this is a pleasure to drink, particularly on tap."
"Good, but I will try to age the next one a bit further."
"This is an outstanding American made dubbel, it is very difficult to find. It compares with many of the true belgian dubbels. Pours a nice head, very creamy, but does disappate quickly. Nice dark aroma with some spicy plum esthers. Extremely strong and the alcohol is well hidden. A bit pricey..ie Ommegang is more reasonable. But if you can find it, you'll not be disappointed."
"d: Pretty good considering abv. Great creamy texture. Nice flavor, good complexity and balance. A good dubbel. The makers of Bourbon County and Imperial IPA do a surprisingly good job with Belgian styles. Keep up the good work Goose Island."
"D- For 9 percent alcohol this is damn drinkable. Very smooth. I was going to hold onto this one longer but I acidentally droped the bottle and cracked the neck, didn't seem to damage the flavor and there was still ample carbonation."
"Pours a murky brown that shows heavy ruby tints when held to light. Crème head that is minimal at first and doesn't stay around. Nose is strong raisins, sugar, and yeast. Flavor is even and smooth. Nothing wild. Minor sweet tone. Little bit of wood. Typical dubbel kind of stuff really. Feel has a good carbonation to it and the liquid is good as well. Overall this is a very smooth and well made dubbel. Nothing extremely unusual about it, as American produced Belgian styled beers tend to be."
"Regrets: Didnt have this beer availability on Christmas Eve after dinner and wont be able to take much of it when I leave Chicago."
"Golden murky brown in appearance. Nice lacing. Aromas of sweet dark fruit. Tastes of sweet carmel, slightly tart fruit, almonds, and a bit of clove. Some rum like alcohol shows up in the finish. Mouth feel is creamy. Fair amount of carbonation. Drinkability is good if you like boozy beers. Recommended!"
"Overall a real solid dubbel, but not my favorite."
"Rich malt aroma with plenty if cherry-raisin fruit aromas. A full-bodied brew with plenty of malt and fruit flavors in complex harmony. The Goose demonstrates their mastery of Belgians with this brew. Very drinkable for such a heavy beer. The alcohol never really comes through on its own, but it work well with the little hop bitterness to keep the palette fresh. A great sipper, not session beer, but it is notable for being as drinkable as it is for the style."
"D  Heavy and warming. A nice pair for a cold winter evening or with dessert."
"Notes: my first Belgian ""dubbel," so I can't comment on its consistency, but it seems pretty strong to me, not very complicated, but still very enjoyable for reasons that are hard to articulate, don't pay 10 bucks for a four pack like I did though..."
"nice dark amber color with hints of gold throughout and a thick milky ambery head that leaves lacing all the way down the glass. very smooth and great taste; kinda sweet with hints of almost plum i would say or even in a way it also has hints of the flavor of cinnamon raisin bread to me; doesn't leave any kind of after taste at all; overall a very tasty beer"
"Excellent beer! These guys did good!! Poured with a hazy brown color featuring bronze tones. good head and a little lace. Amazing aromas of esters, dark fruits, malt, spices. Flavors good too, but body's a tad thin. No biggy though. Barely tell the alcohol that's there. Nice finish."
"I had this at the brewery in Chicago. There was a candy sweet aroma and was deep red in pour with little head. Dark fruity in flavor with a slight hint of alcohol. This is the perfect beer to drink right before going to watch the Cubs play at Wrigley down the street (you're still happy even if they lose)."
"This is a great Dubbel from Goose Island. I'm going to pick up another 4-pack soon. It's starting to cool off outside."
"Pours a ruby red with a pillowy off white head that slowly dies down to a fluffy layer that lasts. Stickiness is a complete cover of the glass. Smell is a perfume like white grape with creamy caramel malt. Sweet raisins and some other dark fruits emerge as well with some sweet honey like yeast. I taste a light glazed donut flavor with a maple sugar glaze like a Vermont pastry. Some woody yeast flavors with an almost kettle corn aftertaste. Mouthfeel is nowhere near a Westy 8, but it does the job. Lacks the silky smoothness in other Dubbels. Some mild carbonation with continuous bubbles rising. Interesting attempt at a Dubbel from Goose Island, but the American flavor is there. Definitely try this one and see how it puts up against the true Belgians."
"a chill night."
"Overall: Grab a couple its a well balanced beer. Grab a couple and send me a few ;-)"
"[EDIT: after a year+ in the cellar, the foam and appearance of this beer has increased greatly--fantastic head retention and lacing. caramel malts are heightened in the aroma, and in the flavor. Mouthfeel is overly fizzy, but gone are the medicinal alcohol notes. Overall improvement with time: 3.85/5.0]"
"I've only had a couple of Dubble style beers, and this so far has been my favorite. Deep dark color, with a fruit and caramel aromas. The taste is consistent witht he aromas, I even tasted a hint of banana and chocolate. A very pleasent experience overall, and this beer keeps me interested in pursuing other Dubbels."
"The beer pours an amber color with a thick frothy offwhite head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is decent. It has a warm, alcohol scent that boasts of pale and crystal malts as well as fruity yeast esters. It smells of figs and dates. It appears quite dry. The taste is decent as well. It has a very warm crystal malt flavor. It's full of fruits and yeasty esters. This is just a little too much alcohol flavor for me. It's right there, no hiding it. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a decent beer. It's got excellent yeast character, but it's way too bold with alcohol. It needs more specialty malts."
"This may not be the best dubbel available, but is up there with other American made dubbels. I will try and age my last bottle and see how it ages. This was almost a year old and I will try and get some of the 07 version to age with it."
"Lacking complexity and depth and being a veritable candy-cane beer, the only thing going for the mouthfeel and drinkability here is that theres alcohol contained within. Letdown."
"M?D-Low carb, extremely smooth, and easy to drink....complex well rounded, and I will definitely buy it again. I found it way to easy to drink for something so high in alcohol."
"I could not drink many of these, but then Dubbels are not exactly session beers. That said it is very drinkable for a Dubbel."
"Distinctiveness is one of the most important criteria for me, and there's nothing else quite like Pere Jacques (at least, nothing fresh, i.e., brewed in the U.S.) It pours a deep amber with more than a little gold tinge. Not much head (not a problem for a sipping beer, in my opinion). The aroma is molasses-y malt, with the alcohol coming through nicely. It has a big sweet fruity malt taste, complex and bordering on decadent. It's reminiscent of a cross between a Belgian Golden Ale and an old ale or some other malty style. It has an almost perfect degree of alcohol warming. It finishes just a little sticky, with little evidence of hops. Incredibly satisfying without being filling."
"Drinkability- Probably the most sweetness I have gotten out of a dubbel before. 9% abv seems a bit on the higher side for a dubbel though."
"Drinkability - The 9% ABV is well hidden. A real nice drinker."
"Pere Jacques held up well after two years, i'm impressed."
"Pours a cloudy brown, some orange highlights, thick off white head, nice lacing, good retention. Smell is sweet, candi bubblegum, citrus, bread, little bit of white wine, nice. Taste is sweet, candi bubblegum again, some banana, very fruity in the finish, touch of alcohol, light spice, nice. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, with medium carbonation, but has an almost rough residual sweetness that kills the finish for me. Still a nice example of a dubbel."
"Color is a dark orange-tinged amber, substantially hazed by particulate. Capped by a good amount of thick tan head with decent lacing. The smell and taste were good right after the pour but really opened up shortly after. The substantial malts and alcohol in the nose soon share the air with surprisingly delicate fruit and spice notes. The taste is likewise--a sturdy malt backbone complemented by alcohol warmth, spice, hops, and again the unexpectedly delicate fruit notes. Mouthfeel is chewy and substantial as well without being too clingy. What started out as a decent beer ended up being a welcome surprise."
"The aroma was a bit sour, woody/cardboard-ish, and a bit like good-beer-gone-bad. However, undaunted, I took a sip and was quite surprised. The beer is quite spicy up front, with a warm mouthfeel with lots of stickiness and alcohol esters up front. This beer was served in a long-stemmed glass (looked like a wine or martini glass), and it definitely drank more like a really nice spirit than a beer. Mouthfeel was quite smooth, like a beer that has been secondary fermented (don't know if it has or not). To me, Goose Island beers are a bit hit&miss, but I definitely enjoyed this one."
"Overall, a complex and enjoyable beer that is hampered by just a little too much booze. I think a year in the bottle would do quite a bit for it."
"Poured into a Rapscallion glass, formed a 1/4"" beige head over the lightly cloudy dull burgundy brew. Head falls to a layer of swirly bubbles pretty quick, with an admirable lace presence. Aroma is lightly spicy over the sweetness, with some grassiness. Taste starts with a touch of citrus, quickly giving way to the malt sweetness. Close finds the vegetal again, along with alcohol warmth. Mouthfeel and drinkability were alright, but this just needs bit more zing to make it worth my trouble to find."
"pours a dark honey color with a medium head, smells is dominated by fruit, smells very similiar to some of the great belgians i've had in the past. taste is awesome. again fruity, but with a alcohol presense that is noticeable but not overpowering, i can tell i am drinking this too cold cause it gets better as it warms. full bodied beer, mouthfeel is full and great. GI makes alot of great beers, but this is something i didn't know they were capable of doing, well done."
"Drinkability: I found this to be easy to quaff beyond the higher alcohol content. If you see an aged bottle of this, pick some up."
"Overall an enjoyable American-brewed Belgian style. The 9% alcohol is on the high end for a Dubbel but it fits in seamlessly with the other flavors in the beer. Remarkably smooth and refreshing."
"drinkability is good. balanced, interesting, and enjoyable."
"All around a pleasing beer, very drinkable, highly recommended."
"Pours a three finger, off-white head that fades to a thin layer leaving some lace. Cloudy amber color. Medium carbonation and medium bodied. Raisiny nose. Flavor sweet raisins, fruity, excellent dubbel. Alcohol is hidden, smooth finish. Better than Matilda. Bottled on Jan 23, 2006, keeps good, $2.99 for a 12oz bottle from John's Grocery Iowa City, IA."
"I'm torn, as I know this bottle may have just been bad, since I don't remember the sharp alcohol characteristic when I drank the first three bottles a couple months ago. However, given the price on this one, I'll probably skip it if I see it again."
"Overall a very good beer. Very similar to LeTrappe/Koenigshoeven Quadrupel. Same yeast perhaps?"
"Interesting enough for me, as I do like the style. However, not anything too fantastic for me to seek this out."
"Thanks, Wadsey, for the chance to revisit"
"As above...but I appreciate more balance here. Soft and smooth, the sweetness balanced perfectly by just enough bitterness. I don't know it the bottle, brew, or my palate changed, but I have adjusted my ratings and like it more."
"Pours a cloudy brownish/amber color, nice carbonation, nice little creamy tannish head which stuck around for a little while, some lacing afterwards. The nose is of sweet malts, alcohol, and caramel. The taste is sweet/malty, with a warming effect and a dry caramel finish. Medium body. Drinkable, a very nice brew from GI, but not really a dubbel in my book."
"Flavor is sweet and fruity with some brown sugar and sweet malt mixing with general fruitiness. I also get a bit of cloves mixed in the background. Very smooth and super easy to drink with no hint of the ABV. A tasty brew for sure, that I would enjoy drinking again."
"Dits good, Id have it again, much sweeter than I expected it to be."
"Upon initially hitting the tongue this seems like it will be one of those thick, syrupy beers. However, relative to the style, this is fairly light. In fact, the mouthfeel may be my favorite part of the beer. Evaporates off the palate just leaving the aftertaste behind. Really special in this regard. Dubbel usually aren't your overly-drinkable style but I find this one to be easy to take. Really good!"
"D: Quite drinkable. It's 9% abv but the alcohol is as well hidden as its' Belgian counterparts. This years batch seems to taste better than last years (last years seemed much sweeter than this) Possibly due to my evolving palate. A noble effort. Bring on the 2007 version!"
"Mouthfeel is fine even with low carbonation. Feels full in the mouth but light on the tongue. This is a beer that I could have multiples of in a row. High alcohol controls pace."
"It has a nice deep red color or dark, cloudy brownish color. Small head with poor retention and no lacing left on the glass. It almost looked like wine by the time it reached the bottom of the glass. The smell is very sweet, of caramel malts and some alcohol. It tastes sweet of malt in the front and finishes with some yeast and hints of the alcohol. Low in carbonation also. This is a descent brew, but nothing exciting. The story on the label is very interesting, its always interesting where brewers come up with the names for their creations."
"The alcohol content is a bit much to have this as a session beer but it is still a nice drink."
"Pours a muddy, medium brown with a fast attenuating, tan head. Carbonation is coarse. Some citric esters in aroma. Light carbonation on the tongue with mild citrus and caramel, with almost no hop finish. Nice, assertive malt, with a medium mouthfeel. Drinkability is extremely good for this ABV. Definitely not to style as a dubbel; maybe it should be slotted as a dark strong."
"Poured out a cloudy reddish brown, with a very thin off white head. Decent lacing. The nose offered lots of yeast, ripe fruit, and caramel. The tastes was just like the nose: malty sweetness with notes of banana, rum, brown sugar, and fresh bread. Mouthfeel was medium bodied with fine bubbles. Nicely balanced, but a bit cloying and harsh with the alcohol."
"Bottle courtesy of Tpaliga: Poured a cloudy deep brown color ale with a medium dirty white foamy head with average retention. Aroma of candi sugar, big strong malt and subtle yeast characteristic can be detected. Taste is quite sweet with lots of candi sugar and some dry figs characteristics. Body was definitely fuller then average with some well concealed alcohol. Very reminiscent of Gouden Carolus Keizer though probably not as complex."
"I was pretty disappointed with this beer. Nothing was terrible about it, it just wasn't interesting at all for me."
"The smooth taste was slightly hindered by the sweetness, which was a helpful pointer on other qualities of the ale. I thought about fruit flavors and how this ale would taste great with a sweet and sour pork."
"very little head, nice lacing. color is dirt/clay brown and cloudy. smells malty and fruity like overripe apples, watermelon, cloves. pretty complex nose. taste is fruity and sweet...alcohol is present but not overbearing. cloves and red fruits abound. sweeter take on a dubbel than im used to. i like it but im not blown away. smooth and well balanced, sticky. easy to drink at first but harder ass it warms a bit and almost becomes too sweet and sticky."
"Poured into chalice a musty deep reddish brown. Its got decent retention and tiny bubbles. The head dissipates fast and lingers around bottom, but with a Dubbel I never really expect too much head any way so thats fine. Smells of sweet malt, hints of coffee and chocolate, there is tinge of wine or port like smells to the nose with some nice dark fruity esters. Definitely the sort of musty malty smell of a Dubbel. Tastes of both sweet and toasted malt with apple and plum esters, maybe even a tinge of anise. The hop character here is extremely minimal, which is what I'd expect with a Belgian style Dubbel. The longer I sit with this beer the more I like it. For me its not the immediate gratification of one of their other Belgian style reserve batch beers ""Matilda", but is definitely better than their ""Demolition"" ale. This is a nice American style dubbel its very possible I'd buy again."
"Too sweet to do more than one or two a night, but oh, so yummy."
"drinkabilty: easy, and very enjoyable"
"Adam"
"D: Drinkable, but on certain occasions. The abv is noticeable, but not over powering. Good one on a cold fall day."
"D - Good drinkability. Enjoyable and fairly complex. Another winner from mlh1227. Thank you!"
"Dark amber colored appearance with average head which diminishes quickly, but a thin layer remains throughout the course of the beer. Sweet finish and end which is slightly too yeasty for my taste. Very bold and complex, which will leave you scratching your head. Good beer for fans of such beers."
"Mildly sweet with some fruit characteristics that resemble a pumpkin ale to some extent. Not as fruity or sweet as some dubbel's I've quaffed, but enjoyable nonetheless."
"D: A pretty tasty beer: nice flavor and aroma. Would love to try it paired with cheese or dessert."
"Pours a hazy brown with only a little head (likely a result of the beer being a little to too cold). The smell is practically all malt. I do get a little smoke which subsides and the beer warms. I also start to pick up some nice yeast notes. The taste is a spicey sweetness that is really very nice. There is also a small sour note at the end which becomes more pronounced with warming. Overall another very good brew by goose island."
"I had this on tap at Cole's 15 months later and just as good. Sweeter and not as sour as the earlier tasting."
"A very tasty sipper, I wish I had several in the cellar for future evenings  around 2008."
"Slàinte!"
"This is a malt bomb. If you love malty sweetness this is for you. As a homebrewer I am very familiar with this flavor, reminds me of fresh wort from the mash. SWEEET!"
"Pere Jacques and Goose Island's other Belgian offering (Demolition) make for a formidable duo. Highly recommended."
"This is one phenominal beer. I'm not a goose fan, but these speciaties have been really extrordinarily good. Recommended!"
"D: Ehh. I expected more. Not as bold and robust of a flavor as I had hoped for. I felt that it was dialed back a bit."
"Mouthfeel is smooth, medium bodied, slightly sweet, and hiding that 9% nicely."
"Pours a ruby red into my chalice. Not much in the way of a quick lasting frothy head from an agressive pour, dissapointing. Very bubbly and effervescent looking. Aromas very belgian, though not much coming from the yeast: sugary, plum, a little banana and clove, and some alcohol. Flavors are actually a bit watery despite the slick mouthfeel. Very sweet, spicy, alcoholic and then gone. No hops detected, but not very representative either. Overall a big dissapointment from a series that I've enjoyed two others greatly."
"It is full in body and sweet in the finish. Not bad, was anticipating a bit more in the flavor after I got a whiff...but all in all not too bad."
"Beer pours a cloudy brown color with small head a minimal lacing. Smells of malty ripe fruit with a tinge of breadiness and alcohol. Taste is better. Fruits and berries, grapes, yeah I'm getting grapes here. Sweet malts dominate, as they should. Mouthfeel is medium, but creamy at the same time. Very smooth. Drinkability is also nice. Overall, I nice stab at the Belgian style by a brewery that (from what I can tell so far) make some quality stuff."
" Good drinkability, as dubbels go."
"I would have never guessed this came from Chicago if it was given to me in a blind tasting. Amazing stuff, completely authentic. The brewer should be proud of himself for brewing such a beer without the local yeast and other little nuances only found in the Belgian countryside. Color me impressed, but this is an amazing beer. Highly, highly recommended!"
"A great back porch beer but my least favorite of the ""reserve"" Goose Islands so far. I've yet to try the Matilda."
"This beer poured a murky amber color with minimal tan head. The aroma was a bit of raisins and a bit of banana bread and only a slight hint of the abv. The taste is very pleasing and true to the dubbel style. I tasted the raisins and some other fruits combined with a great malt backbone. This beer is a definite sipper to allow you to enjoy the full body and flavors of this one."
"Drinkability - This goes down fairly easy, but I would not have more than two in any one sitting, partly because of high abv, but more importantly, because I'd tire of this after two ( but don't get me wrong - this good ale, it's just not my thing ) ."
"I poured this one VERY slowly into the brandy snifter that I had been provided at the Sharp Edge Beer Emporium, so as not to disturb the lees, but this produced only a wispy head as a result. C'est la guerre! The color was a deep amber, almost orangish. The nose was complex, with notes of malty sweetness, a scent of candied fruits, yeast-driven mustiness, and a hot alcohol burn that tickled my sinuses. The mouthfeel was at once thick, full, and hot. No playing around, here. Coming back to my senses, I note sweet cherry as the dominant flavor. The finish had a combination of the cherry intermingled with a yeasty mustiness. My last pour was of the lees and it had a much more pronounced taste of yeast, not surprisingly."
"Alcohol warming on the finish. Wouldn't have guessed 9% alcohol. This goes done very very easy. I enjoyed this immensely. It is sweet but not to sweet. 4 pack disappeared rather quickly. I would definitely buy it again"
"Pours a thick, murky reddish burnt orange, with a little bit of off-white head and a bubbly lacing down the glass with longs streaks here and there. I love when American brewers go after Belgian styles and do well, and from the nose I can tell this one is going to be right on. Very pleasing aroma, a little light, but full of fruit, the alcohol has a brandy vibe to it, somewhat phenolic though. And while the aroma as a little medicinal string in there, the taste is an absolute beauty, an on-spot dubbel interpretation. A cascade of delicious flavors, full of fruits and that sweet brandy alcohol twinge that I really like, a molasses in there, a sweet bit of caramel, and fading sweet aftertaste that really just caps off a delicious brew. My friend brought this one, and I""m going to have to pick up a few for the cellar. A very good beer, and impressive in its interpretation of this Belgian classic."
"What a damn cool story on the label. Dark Amber. Large, frothy, lasting head of foam. Aroma of cocunut, bourbon, caramel, chocolate amd dark fruits. Notes of pit fruit, blackberries, cocunut flakes, chocolate, caramel, dark fruits and banana are present in the flavor. A very good beer overall."
"Overall not a bad beer in any sene of the word, but i thought it lacked the complexity and transitions you would expect from an elite belgian beer. Raisin and fruit flavors were present, crisp and sweet. Mouthfeel is full and smooth, drinks easily. I would like to try this one served a little warmer, but overall, good."
"This is a great beer. Thanks to bditty187 for this one."
"Not a bad dubbel, just not my style. Pours out to a medium chestnut brown color with lower carbonation. Dense head of foam. Aromas of fruit, yeast and malt. Simplicity in aroma, yet nearly perfect. Wonderful smell. Taste is good; flavors of belgian yeast, malts, grapes, plumbs and some spices. Mouthfeel is very belgian-esque. Slightly chalky and milky smooth. Pretty good drinkability considering the 9 % ABV."
"Unfortunately, between the high ABV and the richness of this beer, it would be hard to drink more than, say, two in one sitting. Very tasty!"
"Surprisingly tasty, complex brew from GI. Not many of their brews really do it for me, but this one is probably one of their best that I have tried along with their IPA."
"Amber to dark copper in color and very hazy, this beer is topped by a thin tan colored head. Funky aroma. It has some yeast character, a bit of citrus, and some dates, but there is almost a chemical nature to the smell. Better tasting. It has a lot of caramel malt, a little pear, some orange, and a little spice (cinnamon?). Very smooth mouth feel. The beer hides the 9%ABV very well. The mouth feel grows as you continue to sip. Much better beer than the aroma suggested."
"Haven't tried it in a while. I wasn't terribly impressed the first time around...this time, seems to be better. A typical amber, clingy, hazy brew with golden highlights. Head retention started off slight, but hung around nicely. Sweet aromas of belgian candy, prunes, cherries, dates, and quite spicy from light hops and alcohol. Tastes quite the same with more emphasis on the malty, candy sweetness and alcohol. Sweetness takes on tacky and sticky proportions and the alcohols lend a light plastic and hot spiciness. Body is moderately heavy with a light oily texture. Finishes quite sweet and dry because of the alcohols. The brew has improved mainly because of it's maturing, and my tolerence for this style of beer. Still wish it had more Belgian yeast esters and muskiness. This would have added complexity and roundness."
"D- This beer is smooth and soft but has a lot of complexity hidden under that sweet goodness. This makes an excellent beer to finish a meal."
"Drinkability and notes: Drinks well but can become a little boring towards the end. A Belgian style ale should be complex so that it keeps you interested and coming back for another sip. This one doesnt do that for me, though it is enjoyable. All in all, this American-made dubbel ranks a touch above average in my book."
"A pretty good Dubbel, especially when the fact that it is an American version is taken into consideration. I will visit this beer again."
"I had no idea Pere Jacques would be this impressive. In fact, I'd put right up there with some of the best Belgian dubbels in the world (i.e. those actually brewed in Belgium). It is, without question, the finest American dubbel that I've had yet."
"Stunning. Golden brown is the pour, and orange and caramel is the smell. I can taste sweet orange wedges and a hint of syrupy caramel. The mouthfeel is smooth like a counter top. It's strong, but I want more and more. This is complex and a real winner. I absolutely love this beer."
"Pours a golden amber with floating yeast and a finger of white head fading to a skim. Nose is authentically Belgian finally, with yeast, candi sugar, and super-ripe tropical fruits. Taste starts off with spicy yeast with musty ripe fruit, candi sugar, caramel malt, light oak and a slight alcohol kick. Mouthfeel has that dry champagne finish I've been craving with these three with subtle, tingling carbonation. This was a pleasant surprise and a much needed bolsterer of my faith in American Belgian knock-offs. Sweet and complex, just a delicious creation by Goose Island here. My favorite dubbel to date."
"This is one of Gooses better specialties. I had read somewhere (obviously an unsubstantiated source) that this recipe had been retired but was very happy to see it back on the shelves of my favorite vendor. That unsubstantiated source has me thinking that I should cellar some of this fine brew."
"Appears a cloudy apricot brown hue forms a nice sized head leaves fine belgian style lacing around the glass. Aroma has deep vinous fruit layers with tart apples and raisins, touch of alcohol, bready yest with herbal hops finishes with a touch of spiciness. Taste has mild spiced bread, brown sugar coated pears, touch of tart apples and raisins finishes a bit alcoholic with herbal hops in there as well. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy texture fine carbonation medium bodied ale stays on the palate and is welcomed by this drinker. Drinkability definitely ahead of the typical microbrewed belgian style ale only a handful of others can do better very enjoyable flavors and seems like I could definitely have another one."
"Reddish brown appearance, murky in quality. Head is very creamy, small and flat. Laces thickly but in simple horizontal bands. Nice fruity aroma, some qualities of brandy. Mouthfeel is full with a nice quality on the tongue. Starts with considerable mellon, pear, and some raspberry tones, a rummy molasses sense takes hold midway through the flavor profile. Aftertaste is a little too sweet to my mind, sickly with some back up through the nasal pasages -- like baby food desserts. The alcohol is decently hidden, but noticeable. Pretty nice, a little cloying (some reminders of fruit antacids) for good drinkability to me."
" The underlying asset of this brew is its sinister but extraordinary drinkability. One of the few Belgian craft beers I wanted to poke back 3 or or more of in a sitting...Hear that Unibroue? D-R-I-N-K-A-B-I-L-I-T-Y"
"D - Due to the high abv, its not a session beer. For a dubbel, there isnt enough smooth complimentary flavors to make this a well balanced dubbel. I like it though."
"D- Alcohol is well hidden, a pleasant drinking experience"
"Spotty thin head with dotted carbonation and a dark amber body. Rummy, with raison and dates. Rather vinous at the base with a slick fruity middle, and warming spicy finish. Medium but rich bodied. Rather strong in the alcohol department and therefore quite warming. Leaves a candied sugar sweetness lingering long after each sip. Decent but barely justifiable of the price. Cool bottle and story though."
"This brew pours a dark, deep amber color, bordering on brown. Its not exactly clear, but a translucent, murky color. The head is attractive, but modest and short-lived. Nice aroma!!! Lots of malt and esters. It's composed of toasted, caramel, and Belgian pale malt smells and flavors. Banana and plum. Rising bread. Malt, Malt, Malt. This brew is sure focused on the malt. I love it. A little sugar flavor is in there too. Theres considerable sweetness in his one, mixed with a little alcohol warming. The alcohol doesnt come out in the taste right awayits a slow, creeping warming (very nice!). Moderate carbonation, maybe a little too low for the style. Theres some peppery phenols that become more pronounced as you work through the glass. The smell could be a little more powerful, but this is a well-crafted, complex, delicious brew!"
"Gone in a heartbeat, taste is pretty good, but how this beer is put together as a whole is what makes it easy to drink. It has a lighter body with big malt character that keeps it flavorful."
"Hazy copper/dark orange with a small medium-sized-bubbled head and not much lace. Smell is caramel candy with a touch of dark fruit and banana. Flavors are dark fruit with alcohol soaked bread, malts are strong as are the sweets. Mouthfeel is a bit thin and the body suffers along with that. For a 9% ABV this beer is a stupidly easy quaff. Beers this gentle should only be consumed at home or a location that you won't be driving away from."
"This beer has a reddish hue, with a high clarity. Lots of head to start but it diminishes quickly leaving a ring. Smell is distinctly fruity and alcoholic. It tastes sweet and nectary, no bitterness at all, and not much finish to speak of. The mouthfeel is light and thin with a decent amount of carbonation. This was a good attempt to create a Dubbel but I didn't gather enough complexity in the flavors."
"A good malt flavor with slight hops. Great belgian Dubbel. The alcohol is well hidden for 9%."
"Overall, a very highly recommended beer, a great example of its style, and inexpensive to boot. Thanks Goose Island!"
"Hats off to GI for this terrific beer. It was a 2004 vintage and was great stuff. It was a nice brown-cherry color with a chunky head that fades to chunks of head and gives up lacing. Big smell of belgian yeast fruit phenols and sweet malt minced with alcohol. Slight spice of the yeast up front is meet well by the sweet malt and fruity flavor that has a long finish. I really took my time smelling and drinking this beer and I can't wait to find some more. Great stuff."
"ok. this is one of three best american belgians on the market today. (looking back, i've rated 4 higher..) close your eyes and this is westvleteren.. st. bernardus.. affligem. then open your eyes, see the english on the label, the $2 price tag, and kiss those stars and stripes baby. this is the united states of fucking america and we make some kick ass fucking beer. hallelujah."
"Drinkability: I drank some of these when the beer was first released. This bottle was bottled on 9/04. This has mellowed compared to my memory of first drinking this beer. Some of the rough edges have fallen off. I know where I can get another pack of this tasty brew and intend to buy it."
"Taste; sweet raisins, some orange peel, definite candied sugar, molasses, has a bit of warming alcohol, although I don't get any of it in the taste. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, and a litlle sticky, probably due to the candied sugar. I bought a four pack several months ago and tried one at that time. I liked it then, but it seems to have gotten much better since I let it sit for about 5 months. I found this to be very enjoyable."
"12 ounce bottle, label tells me the bottled on date and that this one will improve for 5 years..Good news, but his particular bottle wont last more then 20 minutes...pours medium almond and semi cloudy with a decent amount of floating yeasty sediment. Minor white head and nondescript lacing. Nose is fruity, raisiny, yeasty and quite Belgian in nature. Smooth mouthfeel, very drinkable heady, complex Belgian styled brew. More raisins, yeast, and cookies, alcohol well hidden in the flavorful background. Nicely crafted ale, well worth a try."
"Thanks to Bashiba for sharing this brew!!!"
"I like this one quite a bit...a desert type brew..hits the mark pretty nice as a Dubbel....I'd definitely enhoy a few of these in the future if given the chance..."
"Drinkability is good a very enjoyable dubbel, to bad its retired. Thanks go to Hometown Sports BIF and ImWithStupid for this treat."
"Drinkability: No alcohol noted. A great way to finish off a warm fall day. I don't know how true this is to the Belgian style but it's very well done. Strongly recommended."
"The sweet malts mingled with the yeast and the hops combine to form a blanket of taste and aroma that are so pleasing that I will seek out this brew wherever I go."
"D - Would be high if not for 2 things: cost and odd flavor in the back of the brew. really if they just coreected the finish, this would be a great beer."
"This one pours up amber to brown in color. The head is nice at two fingers then dwindles to one with minor lacing half way down. The smell is fiant grainy and not at all hoppy. The taste is a shocker, I gave it a higher rating because of the robust sweetness which I do not normally go for but in this case the curve of the taste threw me it was nice. The mouthfeel is average but nice and smooth. I knocked the drikability of this one because of the overwhelming sweetness. I wonder if letting the beer sit and grow would even the taste."
"Notes: This was my 8th and final bottle of two 4-packs I bought last Christmas. I don't think I'm a good enough critic to judge any flavor variation due to time, so I won't try. Let's just say that this was the finest Goose Island I've had, from first to last."
"CHEERS! Beertracker"
"Terrific mouthfeel. Bubbly and oily. Sweet on the tongue. A touch of raisin and a bit of citrus. Malty. Sticky aftertones. Absolutely good."
"A very drinkable dubbel, it lacks the flavorful zing of some of its bretheren. It also doesn't look as pretty as most authentic Belgian dubbels when served in the proper glassware. Other than that, it's alright, just not worth seeking out if a good authentic Belgian dubbel is available in you neck of the woods and doesn't cost an arm and a leg."
"Nice frothy head atop a mahogney base. Good lacing. Dried fruit, sugars, a nice blend of spices in the nose. Alcohol is still very up front though. Some burnt sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, pepper, and light bitterness across my tongue. Medium body. Lingering burn"
"I think it is a great and drinkable beer."
"This is boring. I've had a decent amount of dubbels, and it just doesn't compare. I hate saying negative things, but where's the wow, the punch? It is sneaky, can't taste the alcohol, but I'd rather spend the money on other dubbels. eh."
"The 9% alcohol is invisible. I would not have guessed that content at all. I'd like to come back to this after a year or two and see if/how the flavor develops. As it stands for now this is unbalanced, and for about the same amount of money I could get equal amounts of St. Bernardus 8 or 12 which I would much rather have."
"The flavour throws off a very weird pseudo-sour apple-cherry ending in the beginning. This is the first thing I notice. This after effect seems to either tone down naturally or become muted by familiarity. The initial contact between my taste buds and the beer is inconsequential in a manner of speaking...then the weird fruit cocktail thing happens. Cool. Unique to be certain. Super wet and juicy. Good structure of body for the flavour. Just bordering on medium weight. Almost refreshing but a bit too sweet to be considered ""quenching."" I like it. Key notes are ""juicy"" and ""fruity"" and ""unique."" I will drink of this entity once again."
"Update - I missed the '06-'09 vintages but had a chance to try the 2010. It has mellowed a lot over the iterations and I noticed that the ABV went down from 9.0 to 8.0. It lost a lot of the harsh character that I noted five years ago which is great although I though this year's effort lacked proper carbonation for the style. All in all still a very good beer."
"Pours a hazy brownish-orange, with good head retention. Definite dark fruits and spices which dominate the aroma & flavor. Very sweet..full, rich flavor. Goes down deceptively easy..and at 9%, it catches up with you quick. In my opinion, a very good interpretation of a Belgian-style dubbel. Proves that American craft breweries can keep up with the centuries old Belgian recipes. Well worth trying if you find it."
"Pours a medium brown with orange tint with a nice creamy looking head that leaves a nice sheet of lace behind,bid phenolic smoky/spicey aromas with a touch of bubblegum.Flavors are quite yeasty and spiced,cinnamon and cloves with some plum and lingering smokiness in the finish.Very yeasty but bot overpowering in the spiciness even a little soft,well made and enjoyable and quite quaffable for the alc%."
"Dark honey colored with suspended particulate matter and an orangey colored thick head that sinks very quickly. Aroma is big and rich, very malty and fruity, no yeast coming out, full of sweet candy and brown sugar. Flavor is huge and compex - very rich upfront, sweet without being cloying, full of ripe fruits, cotton candy, cinnamon, chewy sweet malt, toffee, light brown sugar, and an alcohold sting. Very drinkable, but I'll be sipping it slowly. Great selection from a quality brewer."
"Pours a cloudy bronze color. Slight orange tint. Thin beige head disappeared immediately. Caramel , raisins, spices and alcohol in the nose. Sweet caramel, fruity flavors such as green apple, sugary sweet. Slight spicy flavors along with that Belgian yeasty flavor. Medium body, carbonation was too high. Slightly warming, but alcohol somewhat hidden. Aside from the carbonation being off, this seems to be a solid brew. Well done by Goose Island."
"This one could be a session beer if it was not for the alochol."
"Looks amber red with a minimal head. Aroma is slightly funky, musty. Taste is rich with ripe fruits. Plums, dates, some pear. Malty, not dry as most other belgians I've had. Slightly sour on the finish. Mouthfeel is wonderfully thick. One of my personal favorite belgian beers now."
"D - Very nice to drink, but a bit heavy to have more than one of, despite the low carbonation. This one's meant for sipping!"
"Huge BA thanks to AKSP for sending me a bottle of this."
"The body is light but holds the flavors well enough and the carbonation seems near perfect. The various flavors could take a bit of getting used to. Alcohol seems a little too strong and the spices and sweetness could use some tempering, but in the end they are awesome in working with one another. The best G.I. offering I have sampled yet."
"The mouthfeel is medium to thick, but quite thin for the style. Still quite enjoyable, though. I couldn't possibly rate the drinkability any higher because of the huge, in-your-face alcohol content paired with the huge malt and candi sweetness; nonetheless, I quite enjoyed drinking this beer and might even do so again before stock runs out (even though there are many REAL Belgian dubbels available I have yet to try at Dirty John's). Not very true to the style, IMO, but well worth a drink."
"Pours a bronze tinted medium brown with a thin, sticky, white head and plenty of streaming bubbles. Candy sweetness is very evident in the aroma, as well as tart green apple esters, some nuttiness, and alcohol. There is a big malt flavor up front, with some subtle fruityness, and a spicy peppery note. Very well rounded. More of the candy sweetness is evident as the beer warms, along with an alcoholic raisiny note. Medium bodied with some carbonation. This beer is very smooth and highly drinkable. Another great release from GI."
"This was not a bad beer, but nothing about it really jumped out at me."
"from the bottle.poured a muddy amber. with a tan head.aroma a fruity yeasty, honey, grapefruit, malts, hops, alcohol, sugar, grapes, floral, musty. flavor, hops, malts, and mild sourness, than some honey comes in along with some apples and dark fruits. not to bad of a beer glad I got a 4 pack going let this cellar for a couple of years."
"Amber is the base color but there are strong influences of peach and gold. Subtle purple highlights. The color is lovely; there is plenty of depth to dazzle the eye. Animation has noticeable in the slight haze and suspended yeast bits. The head was off-white in color, at the apex the foam was almost two fingers in height, it quickly faded to a thin, soapy collar. The liquid is absolutely lovely but the poor head retention is a major bummer. There was no subsequent lacing. If this beer had any sort of head retention and just a little lacing this beer would look perfect. That is how yummy the liquid is! The nose is lively at first. Right out of the bottle there is a big alcoholic blast with a complex array of dark fruits and licorice. However once the beer reaches the glass it lost much of its luster. That sucks. Now the nose is heavy on prunes with candied sugar influences. Spicy. Neutral maltiness, okay, there is some toffee and cola. Grapes. Orange peel. The bouquet is okay on the whole. It doesnt say as much as Id like. The invitation is whispered by the end, where did the primal scream go? The palate is flavorful. Is this the most complex Dubbel Ive ever quaffed? No. There is a cleanliness about it that says American. I get the same vibe from New Belgium. It isnt a bad thing; it is just hard for me to elevate the beer to a higher status. Upfront is a spicy jolt that is quickly backed up by some prunes and grapes with some orange zest. Candied sugar. Toffee. Cola. In the middle is a suggestion of burnt caramel and alcohol heat that blends with some kisses of ginger and cinnamon. The finish has a slight kiss of medical flavors (this alone makes me rethink my comment about this beer being too clean. I guess it is not too clean, it just isnt dirty enough for me until the finish). I hope that makes sense. There is a sugary aftertaste with some sticky, alcoholic residue. So, on the whole, the palate is very tasty. I dont find this beer to be amazing. I do find it to be very enjoyable. IMO, it is too costly to buy regularly (not like I can buy it in Nebraska anyway). It is better than NB Abbey. Medium in body, the carbonation is moderately low, it is very natural on the tongue. The mouthfeel is relaxing and pleasant. It fits this beer very well. Damn this beer. I purchased a 4-pack in Milwaukee, WI for $8. The first three bottles didnt really wow me. Maybe I didnt have my beer thinking cap on. Maybe I drank them too cold. Maybe I was just stupid. Whatever the reason, I wasnt impressed with this beer. I put off reviewing it because I thought it was ho-hum. I will eat my thoughts. This beer is pretty darn good. There is just something about it that tickles my fancy. It is clearly Belgian. It is obviously flavorful. It has a lovely mouthfeel and it is damn fun to drink. Im happy I enjoyed this bottle. I guess I will have to buy more in the future. Worth a try."
"Full-bodied in mouthfeel. A rather odd entry, overall. The nature of this fruity character seems a bit off for a dubbel, but I certainly wouldn't classify it as a trippel, either. Not bad however one chooses to classify it, though."
"Glad to see Goose begin to bottle some of their specialty beers - I here Bourbon Barrel Stout is to follow."
"Lightly bitter and toasty up front, but just briefly. Huge fruity malts come on quick and hard. Sweet, sugary toffee malt base, but this gets overshadowed by sweet, ripe fruit juice on the palate. Kiwi, banana, strawberry, and random tropical fruits. Fortunately, not too sweet. Finishes fruity, sweet, and lightly alcoholic, with faint bitterness. Maybe a little overcarbonated, especially up front. Otherwise nice, thick, and syrupy. Not bad."
"Update 3/1/06 - Tried my last bottle tonight after giving it some additional time in storage. No real changes other than the flavors melding together a bit better, providing some chocolate-like flavor. Pretty much the same, giving testament to how well the beer will hold up."
" Wow! Some Goose. The beer poured a cloudy rust color. A small cream colored head formed only to fade fast. The aroma was of sweet fruit with caramel. The taste while complex was not overpowering in any area. Fruits like sweet apple, pear and banana drizzled in caramel with a spicy alcohol that gave chase. The mouthfeel was carbonated, setting off a rich, creamy warming trend. The drinkability of this 9% was unbelievable. So smooth and drinkable, Goose Island has to make thisone again!!"
"Thanks very much to MJR for this one. The Pere poured into my glass a murky orange-brown color, with a fairly viscous cream colored head. The nose is jam packed with all kinds of malty goodness, sticky sweetness, light fruit, and a hint of alcohol. The creamy head soon vanishes into the opaque depths of this beauty after the first sip, swirling away likea mini Milky Way. Taste has a sharp bite of alcohol in the foreground, that mellows and smooths as the beer warms. Eases on into a hint of spice and the sweetness of cotton candy, caramel, apple crisp, and boozey pear. I was quite unprepared for the complexity of this one. Alcohol perks up a bit more again in the finish, with a little heat on the way down. Medium heavy body and moderately carbonated. Pretty fantastic."
"Mouthfeel is richly creamy and chewy...body is lovely. Drinkability is damn good as well. A tasty, complex dubbel brewed in the USA and by Goose Island no less....makes me proud to be from Chicago :-). Definetly worth a try and a bit of age does it some good!"
"Drinkability is very good, especially for a beer this big."
"I didnt know Goose Island had it in em! Dark brown color with ruby tones. Thick and fluffy beige head and nice lacing. The aroma is full with malt, dark fruits and spices. Rich body with a smooth array of flavors, from sweet malt, plum, and banana to spices and hops. The finish is flavorful with yeast, and a bit of spicy alcohol. This is probably the best Goose Island beer out there."
"I have not tried too many dubbels, and this was good but I think it could improve with age (as they state on the bottle). I think I will have to buy some more and try to cellar them to see."
"Full bodied with mild carbonation. Rich and creamy feeling. A delightful Belgian style ale, perfect for sipping any time. Would make a good pair for an Asian or mid-Eastern dish."
"As a frequent fan of dubbels, I find no fault at all here, and in fact see this among the higher stratum. I've enjoying many good brews from the Goose, and I'm finally ecstatic to know that they can crank out something truly stellar! That's what this is, to me, a big, malty, sweet, tasty, nearly decadent creation. Citric notes intervene near the end, and they play well with the other flavors. 9%? Didn't feel it at all, until...now...goodnight, ...and cheers to the fine brewers at Goose for turning stuff like this out...and to faernt for sending it my way!"
"Pours a deep red color with a thick fluffy head that sticks around for a while. Sweet and malty aroma with a little fruit and some spices. Smells very pleasing. Flavor is sweet and malty with some fruits thrown in there. There is also a small spice character. The finish reminds me of a brown sugar sweetness. Has a nice body and it's easy to drink. I'll definately have this one again."
"Thanks to MJR for this one."
"Pours a very hazy amber with a nice 3-finger head. Head stays for a while and leaves a decent amount of lacing. Smells very sweet and fruity. Not too much though. Just the right amount of sweetness and malts to make it a wonderful sniffer. Very sweet tasting at first. Nice and malty with hints and grape and raisens. On the finish it smoothes out and the alcohol really shines through. Warms you right up the whole way down the chest. Nice bubblegum taste in the mouth. The mouthfeel is very smooth with a nice amount of carbonation. Hops abound the aftertaste. Very drinkable, especially considering the high alcohol content. A wonderful treat to drink. Many thanks to bashiba for sending two of these to me. One of the best brews I've had to date."
"Every week over the past couple months, I've picked up a different Goose Island brew to try from my local beer store. I saved this one for last since it looked intriguing - no big goose head on the label for starters! It pours a murky reddish brown with a very slight head. The smell is quite sweet, reminiscent of apples. The taste is very good - a full, fruity core with a fair amount of alcohol bite to it. While I am still a relative newcomer to Belgian styles such as this, I very much enjoyed it. Way to go, Goose!"
"The dark brown takes on a gorgeous ruby tone when held to the light. The head is a little small for style and is the faintest of khakis. The aroma is full of candy sugar and plums. Some toffee and a little tiny bit of banana. The flavor is pretty much the same with just a slight pepperiness from the alcohol. Really not a bad American-made Belgian strong, but the candy sugar flavor seems a little strong."
"The aroma is strong with figs, grae, malt, and caramel. The taste backs up the aroma very well. It tastes of figs, banana oil, cinnamon, apple, all around fruitiness, clove, and a sweet hoppy and heavy finish. The body on it is medium and the sweetness makes it seem heavier than it really is. I found this beer to be quite enjoyable."
"Pours a clouded tawny brown with a thick, almost creamy, light tan head. Aroma consists of candied raisins, dark fruit, malt, yeast and a hint of alcohol. The mouthfeel is full-bodied. Starts with a malt and candied raisin front. Yeast and fruit (plum) taste follows. Warming alcohol feeling is noticeable as it nears the back of the tongue and down the throat. Nice to see that Goose Island is packaging an offering that further shows its brewing capabilities."
"12oz. bottle poured into a tulip-style glass. It pours a deep ruby red color with two fingers of off-white head. There is a bit of lacing left on the glass. The smell is sweet and malty. Lots of raisin, currant, and plum present, a touch of brown sugar. The slightest dose of alcohol. The taste is also sweet. Roasted malt accents all of the dark fruits. Candied plums and raisins. Reminds me of Christmas. A little bit of clove and pepper on the finish. The mouthfeel is thick and strong, yet smooth. The drinkability is scary good for a 9% brew. An awesome Belgian style brew from the guys and gals at Goose Island. Who'da thunk it?"
"Pours a cloudy ruby brown color with a huge light brown head that sticks to the sides of my glass. Fruity sweet and spicy aromas, sugary plum and grape flavors, medium to full bodied with a crisp and carbonated mouthfeel, finishes with some brown sugar sweetness."
"All and all a very drinkable beer that I found quite refreshing. I'd love to stumble across this one again."
"This beer poured a cloudy reddish amber color and formed a small bubbly light tan head that left circular lace as it subsided. A small amount of carbonation is present. An aroma of malt, caramel, raisin and banana. The flavor was of malt, caramel and candy with a hint of the alcohol in the background. The finish is light, with a sweet, buttery aspect to the finish with a warming feel of the alcohol."
"ng"
"Pours a bit on the hazy side, and it is an amber color. It is fairly well carbonated, and shows a tan head when roused. I get aromas of alcohol, cherries, and malt. As I smell deeper the dominant alcohol in the nose begins to die down and more of the fruitiness (raisin and fig, but the cherries certainly dominate) is able to peek out. The taste is fruity up front and finishes with a slight bit of spiciness. There is quite a bit of sweetness left in this beer, it adds to the richness and picks up the fruit notes that are found in this beer. This is pretty enjoyable and would probably age quite well."
"Bring your sweet tooth and dig in."
"smells of plums, caramel, and a slight tinge of alcohol. I really dont know how to describe the taste on this one. It is sweet, tasting as it smells, fruity, some alcoholic esters. This beer reminds me all to much of Sprecher Abbey Tripple. Overall a decent offering from goose island, the second of theirs I have tried behind honkers."
"Gotta shoot out some props to TavernJeff for sliding one of these my way in our last trade."
"Notes: Excellent beer. A don't miss treat."
"There aren't any quirks here but, it is very well made and worth having more. It's good to find another beer made in the USA that has the strength and quality of its Belgian inspiration."
"Overall a very nice, relaxing, warming beer. Complexity is intermediate, and the beer is pretty well balanced. The sugar comes on pretty strong, but that is typical for the style. It does stick around in the aftertaste a bit more than I'd like, but it isn't bad. The medicinal flavor isn't really an off flavor, but more an interaction of the alcohol characteristics with the spice of the yeast."
"Many thanks to silenius for the many samples!"
"The beer after departing the 12 ounce brown bottle sets in the glass a hazy burnished copper with the head portly in size and a winsome light tan color, frothy in texture an as it dissolves the lace forms a thin sheet to cling to the glass. The aroma of banana, sweet malt seem to dominate with a slight hint of fusel alcohol to round it out, start is sweet and thick in malt, the top middling in its feel to the palate. Finish has an authoritarian acidic bite, the hops mild with the aftertaste vinous and extremely dry, the high ABV gives a warming to the tummy, a drinkable tis true."
"This is one of those beers where, after you ponder the first sip for a moment, you think to yourself ""this is a really nice beer."" Poured a very hazy walnut tinged with ruby. Aroma was bright with banana, calling to mind a good German hefe. Well moderated yeast flavors, with the banana once again evident, but not in excess. Malty, with just enough sweetness to balance nicely. Alcohol was slightly evident as a bit of white pepper. I'm not going to worry about how true this beer is to an ""authentic"" Abbey Dubbel, because I like this more than most of the ""authentic"" products I've sampled. An excellent effort on Goose Island's part."
"Overall, a nice effort from an excellent brewery. This ale will probably improve with some age."
"If I wanted to get a quick drunk on, I'd reach for another. But most nights I'll pass for something else."
"So it's not picture perfect. Like a pretty woman with one, humanizing flaw, the many strengths outweight the one misstep. The solid malt backbone and earthy fruit tones keep it basic, but never boringly simple. Each sip augers well for the next. Yes, the ABV makes a serious play, but it doesn't seem to try too hard to lay you low, so it remains drinkably pleasant. My thanks to Jahred for this one, because now I know, if I see it again, I'll have it gladly."
"As for the mouthfeel, it was thick and syrupy, with plenty of carbonation tingling my tongue. This beer was a winner - let's hope Goose Island continues to bottle some of their more extreme beers."
"Thanks to CRJMellor for this one."
"Jacques, Jacques, Bo Baques, Banana, Fanna, Foe, Faques, Fee, Fie, Moe, Maques--Jacques In other words, banana!! Hits you in the nose as soon as you pour. Overwhelms everything else. Pours dark yellow under a thin head. Actually likeable, but a bit overdone."
"Bottle @ Goose Island Clybourne: This wasn't on the menu, but after talking with the waitress she had some other beer options and this was one of them. It was served in a wine goblet. The beer pours a cloudy reddish-brown. There was some head from a fast pour, but it was gone fairly rapidly. There was a big, sweet nose: yeasty, bread, some floral, some fruits with plums and raisins being most evident. The taste was initially sweet, with a slightly sour aftertaste. Some fruits and caramel to the taste. This made the traffic jam that I sat in to get there worthwhile!"
"Drinkability is very high. Hides the alcohol well. Little sharper than the draught version but still very nice."
