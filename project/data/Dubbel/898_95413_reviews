"O: I found this to be a very enjoyable barrel aging on a dubbel - not a combination that I have had a lot of times. I chose the rum barrel aged beer on this cold evening because rum reminds me of the Caribbean and I needed some warm thoughts...and the alcohol warming as well."

"O- lots of dark fruit flavors mix well with the barrel aging.  I nice slow sipper that opens up as it warms"

"Pretty impressed with this beer. Very nice balance. The flavor doesn't blow me away but they kept in check a beer that could get crazy sweet and boozy."

"O: the dubbel is not a style I often go for, but I have so enjoyed all of Heavy Seas Uncharted Waters release in 2013 and 2014 that I picked this up. these guys are doing some real nice work with barrel-aging, and this was an enjoyable ale. May be hit-or-miss for hardcore dubbel fans, but for the curious, open-minded BA, a nice ale for sure."

"Overall - If I wanted to taste brandy, I would go out and buy a bottle. The booze really takes over on this one. I would probably not suggest this one to a friend."
"Worth trying."

"This is a very good barrel-aged beer from Heavy Seas. I really like it. They used the brandy barrels appropriately. This might not be a mind blower, but it's close. I probably could've given this an even higher score. It's just very enjoyable and well crafted. Recommended."

"22 ounce bottle into chalice, 2013 bottling. Pours slightly cloudy deep ruby red color with a nice 1 finger dense khaki head with great retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of plum, raisin, fig, pear, toast, caramel, brown sugar, light chocolate, clove, pepper, oak, toffee, light vanilla, light brandy, and yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of fruity/spicy yeast ester, malt, and barrel notes; with good strength. Taste of plum, raisin, fig, pear, toast, caramel, chocolate, brown sugar, brown bread, clove, pepper, toffee, oak, light vanilla, and yeast earthiness. Lingering notes of dark fruit, caramel, toast, chocolate, brown bread, brown sugar, clove, light vanilla, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice balance and complexity of fruity/spicy yeast and robust malt flavors; with a fair amount of barrel presence and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a smooth and slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent barrel aged dubbel. All around great complexity and balance of yeast ester, robust malt, and moderate barrel flavors; and very smooth to sip on. A very enjoyable offering."

"O: In this beer, the flavor profile of brandy seems an obvious choice for pairing with the complexities of a Belgian beer. This is a great beer, definitely worth keeping an eye out for."

"O - The base beer is a classic example of an American-brewed Belgian beer that's clearly American-brewed, though certainly isn't bad. Unfortunately, this beer seems to have spent very little time in the barrel (probably a continuously used barrel at that) as it tastes young. It hasn't been given the chance to really mingle with the Brandy, which is more of an after thought."
"Overall I am not sure how the base beer is since I never had Holy Sheet but it seems pretty good with brandy notes. Not bad overall."
""
"overall: Very nice beer. Doesn't knock my socks off but I'll look for more."
"O - I have a hard time ""aging"" something once it hits my fridge or household vicinity. This one is in line with my previous belgian abbey ale experiences, and damned if I am not curious what this one would taste like with another year under its belt. As of now, a decent offering worth trying, especially if you are into the style."
""
"3.75 D: Very good barrel effort here. Barrel flavors complement the base beer's flavors quite well."

"O- A nice twist to a dubbel, brandy is tasty. I will pick this up again, seems like it will be nice on a cold winter day."

"The feel doesn't translate as well in this beer. It's smooth, yes, but really seems to run thin. There's not much crispness to liven it, not that I want more than just a little. It simply seems like the brandy got to the body and brought it down some. For a heavy style, meant to be a meal, the body ought to be there. Still, this is a great beer overall."
"Overall, this is a very nice barrel-aged Belgian, the brandy notes blending perfectly with the Belgian notes, and setting a high standard for others to follow. The brandy barrels are inspired here, as too often Belgians are aged in bourbon barrels, which can lend far too harsh of an alcoholic kick. There is perhaps an overabundance of sugar and sweetness as a result, and licking your lips can seem like licking brandy-soaked brown sugar pops, but the beer is nice enough that this isnâ€™t much of a problem."
""
"OVERALL: A bold beer, definitely not shy with the alcohol and big flavors. I think this would be a good choice to set aside in the cellar for a few years to see what happens."
""
"In any case, if you happen to be an afficiandao of mild Belgians, I most heartily recommend this beauty; it is not complex, it will not overwhelm, but it is most assuredly a very nice expression from Hugh Sisson and his motley crew. (Gotta keep that pirate motif going, dontcha know.)"

"To the Point: overall, this is great. The mouthfeel is superb, the aftertaste is long, this is a great sipper that is truly tasty and super smooth, be careful of the 9%"
"Nice dark red hue that was very cloudy, couldn't see light through the glass. The scent of vanilla overpowered most of the other smells. The taste had hints of toffee, vanilla, with a brandy undertone that seemingly got stronger as I drank, but never became overbearing. Was a medium bodied beer, and overall This beer is quite good and worth trying."
