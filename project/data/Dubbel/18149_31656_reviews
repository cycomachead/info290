"Small off white head on a beautiful ruby red brown body.  Aroma of toasted grain, raisins and lightly oxidized caramel.  Lots of toasty malt and raisins in the flavor with a lingering, oddly licorice note.  A fairly thin body with decent carbonation and a dry finish.  This bottle may have been a little on the old side, but nonetheless an unusually well made interpretation of the style for an American brewery."

"To the beer: Deep brown, copper with a tight beige head that left some impressive lacing that lasted the entire glass. A subdued aroma where spice dominates the nose, some malty sweetness suggestive of dried fruit, and a hint of earthy yeast. The flavor expands greatly on the aroma. Spice becomes cinnamon, clove, pepper, with a dash of lemon zest. Dried fruit flesh out to dates, figs, and mainly raisin. Yeast maintains its earthy character. Certainly not as big as the Belgians that inspire this."

"o: well, i'm re-editing my review.  the longer i drank this the more it opened up.  nice mix of dark fruits, spice, sweet malt, and bready yeast.  still a bit too much alcohol, but its an ok malt-driven brew"

"Picked this up at a local wine and beer store here in SoCal on a whim. Was not disappointed at all. Was not overpowering but still had a great flavor. Stands up to its description. I tasted some dried fruits along with a little bit of banana bread and I'm a sucker for banana bread. This is definitely something I would pick up again."

"Very dark brown in color and only a bit of light gets through. Brussels lacing. A quarter inch thick head of khaki covered foam rests on top. Aroma of Belgian yeast and dark Belgian candy sugar is what I'm getting in the nose. The flavor is of dark Belgian candy sugar,dark malt,ands bit of tart Belgian yeast on the finish. Mouth is a bit chewy and sticky."
""
""
"Overall, yeah, this is tasty stuff, if not as complex as it might have been. There's plenty of body, which is good, and a nice about of spice. Some extra sweetness would help, but overall, it's still a really nice beer."

"Got in a trade with swingracex. 750 ml bottle into chalice, bottled on 5/1/2012. Pours slightly hazy deep ruby red color with a 1 finger dense and fluffy khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big raisin, fig, pear, apple, toast, clove, pepper, brown bread, candi sugar, molasses, light chocolate, and yeast earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of malt and yeast ester notes; with good strength. Taste of raisin, fig, pear, toast, clove, pepper, brown bread, candi sugar, molasses, chocolate, and yeast earthiness. Lingering notes of dark and light fruits, clove, pepper, toast, candi sugar, molasses, chocolate, brown bread, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Awesome balance and complexity of malt and fruity/spicy yeast flavors; with a great malt/spiciness balance and zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a moderately slick, creamy, and lightly crisp mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a highly excellent Dubbel style! All around great balance and complexity of malt and fruity/spicy yeast flavors; and very smooth and crisp to sip on. A highly enjoyable offering."

"one thing that did really stand out, however, was the incredible amount of sediment on the bottom, even after swirling a bit. it was a bit like mud and very thick.... still a great vessel for getting a good 8% dose in your system!!!"
""
"The color was a medium dark brown and a two finger of tan foam with a load of lace on the side of a tulip glass. The smell was a little weak, but there was a smell of roasted malts and fruit aroma. The taste was of the roasted malts, with a sweet fruity finish along with and nicely balance of sweetness and bitterness on the palate."

"a lovely dubbel, really. it pours a rich spiced rum color with a bone white head light as a cloud. the nose is straight raisins and booze, both of which I happen to enjoy. there is a nutty element to it as well, really earthy like a walnut, but mildly sweet like an almond. the flavor takes on more of a middle eastern flare than a Belgian one, with flavors of dates and figs, sweet and naturally complex, and the raisins are there too. I love the fact that this isn't as sweet and thick as some dubbels though, its quite drinkable for what it is. the body might be a little thin, but I appreciate the contrast to the rest of the genre, and the finish is fruity and quick, but not sugary or caramel heavy. the spice component is subtle, which I also like. good carbonation as well. overall an outstanding beer from the lost abbey, one im glad I got to try on tap. a very unique take on a dubbel, a welcome change."
""
""
""
"Overall – Really enjoyed this one. A good mix of flavours while not cloying or over boozed. I'd be happy to make this a go to beer if readily available to me."
""
""
""

"Overall, a flavorful double with a bit more complexity than average. There is a bit of alcoholic warmth. The raisins add a nice dimension to this."

"O - An underwhelming Belgian. Smell is strong point, taste is disappointing."

"O: another great brew from the lost abbey, very well rounded with a great use if yeast, nice apple and fruity notes, very tasty."
""
""

"O- Decent brew, tasty and sweet. Don't know if I could kill a pint."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"The body was pretty good, full and smooth, like what you look for in the style, but that bit of alcohol burn on the finish was distracting. Drinkability was decent, the alcohol taste reduced how much I would drink of this. Overall, a decent take on the style. Not great, but not terrible either. At $10 for a 750, you can find other examples as good, and better, for less cash. Still, worth trying though."

"Pours a brilliantly clear deep reddish brown with a stingy off white head that subsides quickly. Smells sweet fruity and syrupy. Lots of brown and candy sugar mixed with dark dried fruits, mostly raisins prunes and cherries. The flavor is sweet with sugary malts and dark fruits. The flavor mimics the aroma quite well no surprises here. Medium body with a light level of carbonation and a sweet almost syrupy mouthfeel. Decent dubbel, nothing outstanding but nothing objectionable either. The bubbles seem a bit light for the style."
"Hazy brown with orange highlights, nice foamy white head with okay lacing. Murky appearance. Nose is raisins, apricot, slightly sour notes. Reminds of pinot noir. Earthy notes sneaking through. Taste is quite subdued for the strength: strong raisin, slight plum and fig, hints European hops flickering in and out. Some tingle from the carbonation, but a very soft mouthfeel overall. Not transcendent, but a hell of a beer."

"This beer is an interesting experience. I may pick up a bottle in the future and age it to maximize the experience."

"Review from 5/2010 notes. Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Pours a dark red brown with a moderate tan head that lasted a few minutes. Aroma of dark and sweet malt, dark fruit and Belgian spice aroma. Flavor of caramel, dark fruits and light malt up front, a bit dry. Slight raisin middle and dry, bland finish. Medium bodied. Nicely made, but could use more bold flavors."
""
""
"Mouth feel is really nice with good bubbles. Really like this beer."
"Pours a murky dark brown with a foamy khaki head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, brown sugar, caramel, spice, and yeast. Taste is much the same along with a slight banana flavor. There is a nice spice finish after each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp but medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer with some solid aromas and flavors that makes it very easy to drink."
""
"O - Not bad, but the Lost Abbey hype machine is at work here. I just didn't find this up with the solid belgian dubbels out there. Its worth trying but nothing special."
""
""
"Overall this is a very solid beer. It's a little less intense than other Dubbels I've had, and I was a little disappointed to not get a bit more dark fruit with the addition of the raisins, but it's still quite a pleasing beer."

"O - A very easy drinking beer, with a very good light fruit taste. Well done"
""
""
""
"B-"
""
""
""
""
"D - A pretty good dubbel, though I've definitely had better. Good quality, high price, fairly easy drinker. I'd probably have it again."
"O: Not terribly impressive, and one of the most disappointing Lost Abbey beers I've ever had. I wouldn't speak out against it, but I probably won't have another one. If you want a dubbel, stick to the Belgian versions."
"Havnt had a beer from here I didn't like.."
"O- A super interesting beer with lots of depth. The fig type flavors are something I enjoy. This is my first Lost Abbey beer and I can say I'm a fan and that it lives up to the hype."
""
""
"Overall-enjoyed but probably wouldn't buy again."
""
""
"O: Not my favorite example of the style - there might be just a little too much woodiness and not quite enough sweetness/sugars in the beer. Not an unenjoyable beer but not one that I will be running out to get again."
"O: This beer is a little too woody for my taste and could use more sugar and sweetness."
"Undated bottle to Duvel tulip the beer pours a nice amber brown color with a decent 3/4 finger head. Some retention and nice lacing. The aroma is that of malty sweetness, raisin, hint of the belgian yeast and earthy hops. The nose is sweet. The flavor follows suit with an initial malty sweetness. The light belgian character comes through as it warms. The raisin fruitiness begins to dominate the palette in the middle along with a mild bitterness. Finishes clean and smooth. Good carbonation. Overall, this is good but isn't my favorite. I had shied away from it so long due to the raisins, a flavor I don't care for. As such I found the flavor too powerful with the fruit, though this could be due to my preference. It was good and I would recommend it, just not my favorite offering from The Lost Abbey."
""
"Overall: a nice Belgian style ale that has a nice balanced flavor. Somewhat refreshing from the crispness. Slow sipping."
"O- Nice Belgian if you are looking for something a bit different, or if you are a fan of red ales. Not as sour/fruity as it looks."
""
"overall - good, but for the price, I'd take most Belgian dubbels over it."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: great beer. tastes similar to Chimay Rouge. would definitely drink again."
"Semi dry feel, medium tingle, and a faint tannin like that of a red wine but much more subdued."
""
"O - An interesting beer with good complexity and an earthy balance."
""
""
"Solid beer. At first, a malty, rich brown brew with a tan head. It's not a typical Belgian style...sweeter, not as aromatic as most. There are some pepper, phenol, and yeast notes, but they sit behind the malt. The flavor has a malt forward character as well...some fruit and pepper, the phenolic attributes come out more in the mid-taste. Nice. The finish is abrupt. Fuller and a little sweeter than I expected. Full in body. This is a very enjoyable brew."
""
"overall - happy with the purchase. I've been trying to branch out of my funky saison/sour lambic fixation and re-visit styles I drank more often in the past. Decided to try the Lost Abbey line-up..totally due to the flack they get on this website. Overall, very good beer and am looking forward to the rest of the Lost Abbey line-up."
"D: good dubbel representation here. flavors work well and the bottle conditioning is really solid. definitely an enjoyable/drinkable brew."
"Delicious and beautifully complex brew. I just wish the cork wasn't so hard to get off."
"O: This is a good brew, but overall I'm not too impressed. There's a great delicate balance to this though with a nice complexity."
""
""
"O - I'm a huge fan of the Dubbel style but this left me a little hunderwhelmed. None of those bright phenolics. Still a decent beer but it doesn't quite fit the style for me."
""
""
" Mouth-feel good, but not sticky, beer needs more sugar. Overall a good beer, but lacking, and it hurts me to say this because these beers have been in our dreams for a long time here on the east coast."
""
""
"O: A very subtle Dubbel with some nice dark fruits and hints of molasses. Nice bouquet of spices in the finish. I expect more flavor from a Dubbel, but still a very good beer."
""
""
"O - Nice dubbel, but not outstanding."
""
""
"I'm not a fan of Dubbels, let me be clear. That's probably why I'm not giving this a stellar review. I can tell that they spent a lot of time developing this beer, as the malt is very toffee centric, but it's not too sweet. And it definitely doesn't let the Belgian yeast turn that toffee into a tart, unpleasant taste that lingers in the back of your throat, like most other Dubbels. For this, I commend them. However, I would like to see some Belgian yeast, as that is one of my favorite flavors to enjoy. Seeing as how I didn't get that aforementioned unpleasantness in my throat, I have to overlook that. A good Dubbel, but could be a little more complex. I would reach for an Abbey Ale by New Belgium first, but this is second for American made Dubbels."

"750 ml bottle, bottled on date of 11/23/10. Served in a DFH Signature glass, the beer pours a murky ruby red/brown color with about an inch tan head. Head retention and lacing are both decent enough. The aroma is nice and malty, the brew smells like dark fruit (mostly raisins, along with some cherries and figs), nuts, brown sugar and toffee. Taste is similar to the aroma, but there's a bit of spice noticeable too. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's creamy and has moderate carbonation. It's also smooth and goes down easy. I think this is a solid overall brew, and at $8.99 a bottle I'd buy it again the next time I see it. Certainly worth a try."
""
""
""
"Medium toast, nutty, and dry malt flavor rise to the forefront while zesty tartness of red wine (slightly vinous), orange zest, under-rippened berries, apples, and grape contribute much needed complexity but to support the malt sweetness and not to compete with them. Early sweetness evaporates into dryness then leaving the impression of malt and fruit flavor but without the associated sweetness. A whimsical delight that finishes with the mild peppery bite of alcohol and black peppercorn. It certainly rivals authentic Belgain-brewed varieties such as Grimbergen Dubbel."
""
""
""
""
""
"Wouldn't recommend other than if you're all about this style or you just want something different to try. Like so much of LA's stuff more."
"On tap at Pizza Port Ocean Beach."
"M - Medium body with a nice chew and light to moderate carbonation."

"750 ml bottle. Pours a hazy dark copper with a small very light tan head that has very good retention and leaves some light lacing. The aroma is caramel, candi sugar, a bit of banana, and some bready yeast. The initial taste is sweet with some candi sugar, then some raisin, caramel, and a bready yeast. Medium bodied. Low carbonation. Fairly enjoyable beer."
"O: Good stuff. I think it needed a more bold flavor but good nonetheless."
"D: Not bad, and an interesting take on the style. Would have liked to see more dominant dark fruits."
"Pours a rich clear brown color, off white foam cap. Aroma is bready, Belgian yeast, fruity, and little hint of alcohol. In the taste, raisin, plum, fig, caramel malt and alittle peppery yeast. Lots of grape, dark fruit and raisin flavor. Just a hint of brown sugar, along with caramel and bready malts. Medium to light bodied with a crisp, even finish. Overall, a very tasty dubbel with good juicy malt flavor and moreish finish."
"O: I'm not sure how much this costs in the store, but I don't think I would pay too much for it. As it was, I thought this was pretty solid..."
"Pours a dark, purplish-brown color with a large, light-tan head that diminishes slowly. Scent has a ton of raisin and prune aromas. A hint of booze and sweet malt as well. Taste is just as it smells. Predominate raisin and dark fruit flavors. A lot of caramel malt flavors and a bit of alcohol in the finish. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied and well-carbonated. Drinkability is fairly high. Out of dubbels, tripels, and quads...dubbels are my least favorite. This one happens to be a good example of the style."
"O: I am a big fan of Dubbels and this is a really good example of a domestic one. I have passed this on the shelf numerous times, and I can't believe it took me this long to finally try it."
"Overall it's a solid beer. It's not my favorite from The Lost Abbey, nor is it my favorite Dubbel but solid nonetheless."
"Over all not my favorite Lost Abbey but worth the price tag."
"Overall: It's a tasty dubbel that, thankfully, doesn't hit hard with any cloying sweetness or enamel-dissolving ethanol bursts. Sadly, I haven't had it since that very first Saints club shipment all those many long years ago."
"Overall this isn't as complex as some other dubbels I've had recently. The aroma in particular is a little disappointing, just not much there."
"Medium mouthfeel but not too sweet. Not a dry finish as in some Belgians. An excellent brew overall."
"O: Great sipping beer. Not to much not to little. Nice attempt at the style."
"D: This style of beer is not one of my favorites but I am warming to the idea more and more. Lost and Found is a big reason why! I like how the sweetness/fruitiness are balanced by the spice. The complexity of flavors masks the alcohol enough to make this a rather drinkable beer."
"Drink- It's easy to drink but was looking for bigger flavors. I think I mostly find this to be a big beer and not overly sweet but could be just a bit more dubbel forward without the raisin."
"The beer pours out as a hazy dark orange brown color. The head is pretty big at first but then it settles down into just a thin tan line over the beer. The smell was a little earthy with some dark fruits and spices mixed in there. The taste wasn't too bad at first while it was still cold, I found this beer to become a little gross as it warmed up. Not sure why, usually that's not a problem with beers. The mouthfeel was decent here, overall the smell and look of the beer are the only good thing about it."
"This brew pours a dark,murky orange hue with decent carbonation that leaves behind a one finger head that stays and leaves a nice rim of lacing,the smell is raisins,figs,spices and herbal hops,it has a medium bodied well carbonated mouthfeel and has tastes of raisins,figs,candy,liquorice and finished with a spicy herbal hoppyiness but not overly bitter just bitter enough to counteract the sweetness first encountered and overall a nice enterpretation of a belgian ale."
"O ~ I like Lost Abbey. This one has been sittin' for a little while, as I had forgotten about it...either way, it was as tasty as the others I've had from them."
"O: I like this beer. Very nice aroma and flavor. The finish could be a little bit less bitter, but it is still an excellent beer."
"Beer is medium in body and quite drinkable. Sweet, mildy fruity, no bitterness, come across a little like a barleywine and less like a dubbel or whatever this is suppose to be. Pretty good, one of the better Lost Abbey, sorry THE Lost Abbey, beers I've had that wasn't barrel whatever-ed. I'd have it again, I believe this was an extra in a trade."
"MF: The beer is flavorful, thick, and borderline syrupy, though it pulls it back just enough."
"Pours a deep murky brown color with red hues throughout with a thick brown head that sticks around for quite awhile and a small amount of lacing. Smells of raisins and dark fruit and a good malt character. Overpowering malts throughout the taste with raisin, grape, brown sugar, and nutmeg. Not a fan of the nutmeg at all. Mouthfeel is thick and oily and it has a nice light carbonation. Overall I think the flavor is very complex with a few notes I don't care for. I think it is a great representation of its style and the raisin really shines through. A good beer."
"D - Drinkability is moderate. It's an easy-drinking beer, but the flavors are unfortunately kind of bland. An okay representation of the style but too malty for my taste."
"O: This was a miss for me, kind of a letdown. The flavor profile is just meh IMO. Didn't go down all that easily, and the lingering flavor wasn't very appealing."
"Update: They say you should finish a growler 1 - 2 days after opening it. This is one of the growlers you should finish the day you open it. I finished mine off on the 2nd day, and could taste oxidation setting in."
"4.0 D: Well, what can I say. For as much as I hate Tomme Arthur, he can make a pretty good brew when he can get it carbonated. This is right up there with most of its native counterparts. If I could trust that every bottle would be this good (read: carbonated) I might even be willing to pay the premium that Lost Abbey commands. Great taste and good overall except for the lack of body."
"Pours a semi-translucent-hazy amber to dark brown. Very thick beige head lingers for awhile. Very rich and complex aroma. The taste is sweet of figs and raisins with a contrast of citrusy lemon or lime. A very drinkable beer, although the carbonation did seem a tinge too high."
"Wow a four finger head of medium dense foam of light brown. This head has some staying power, and leaves a thick clinging lace. Color is a 29 on the SRM beer chart. Smell are many and seem to be ever changing with each draw. There are aromas of raisins, figs, chocolate, banana, caramel, toffee, apple, pear, and citrus. Taste is as complex as the smell, and I am glad this is a big bottle for with each sample, I detect something new. There are flavors of raisins, banana, fig, nutmeg, apple, chocolate, coffee, pear, malt, black pepper, lime peel, caramel, toffee, and licorice. There are others, but I am starting to get a buzz and it hinders my taste buds. Talk about creaminess in my mouth, maybe just a bit heavy on the carbonation, and some drying and sticky feel on my upper palate, but overall very good. This will be a great desert beer, and not bad with sharp cheese, to set off the sweetness. I will have another please."
"There's still a few Lost Abbeys for me to try, but this is my favorite to date."
"Strong aroma is malty and a little fruity with a yeasty underpinning and hints of caramel. It pours a clear dark mahogany with a thick, pale tan head that sticks around for a little while. Flavor is malty, slightly sweet, slightly sour, with hints of caramel and fruit, the latter mainly grapes and apple. It goes down the hatch smoothly yet leaves a firm, persistent tingle behind. I'm glad that this ""lost abbey"" has been found!"
"The taste is sweet which matches the fruity aroma. It pours a dark brown color and has layers of flavors. The thing about this beer that sets it back is the last flavor that sits on your tounge is an odd one. It's like an off alcohol flavor that just won't go away."
"D: This is a lighter and fruitier version of the style; well done."
"Overall I thought this was a solid beer for the style but nothing was present to really knock it out of the park. Worth a shot if you see it around."
"The mouthfeel is perfect for the style; adequately carbonated and finished silky and creamy. This beer overall is pretty good, it is my first Lost Abby beer. Nothing outstanding or epic, but good. Looking forward to sampling more in the very near future."
"D: Excellent. Right on for the style. Very well executed. Tasty stuff!"
"Taste is where this beer comes out. Delcious to say the least. Very fruity tasting, dates, pear, and raisin go on a tear as light notes of chocolate malt give me the feeling that this is like dessert in a glass. The alcohol goes nearly unnoticed, making an already appetizing beer even more addicting."
"d - An ok beer but not my favorite from LA. The raisins are very strong and the alcohol comes through in the taste. Probably wouldn't seek out again."
"Not my favorite LA offering, but LA is certainly one of my favorite breweries."
"A decent Dubbel though a bit too raisiny for me, surely better than on tap and would surely benefit from a more lasting carbonation. But then that's old news. Best served and enjoyed rather warm about 60 degrees or so I would guess.."
"This beer is very drinkable, but I really think that Tomme and co. should just stick to Belgian-style beers and sours, because he hasn't pulled off a German-style beer that I've actually liked, nor do I think he's all that interested in the outcome, anyway. Pours rubyish calico brown without too much foam. I get figs, licorice, faint wood and cinnamon on both the smell and tastes. Alright. More of a spiced brown if you ask me."
"D - Drinkability is good but not great. I really enjoyed this beer but would like to space them out between servings."
"D: Very good tasting beer that is sucking me into the world of Belgian beers. I would recommend this to anyone."
"Bottle, pours a beautiful copper with a solid, foamy off-white head. The nose is sweet and caramelly. A little tang to the palate. Mild fruits, bread, caramel malts and just a smudge of heat from the alcohol. Medium body, with nice carbonation. Somewhat dry and sticky. Very drinkable dubbel."
"I may have given this higher marks if it had delivered on the promise the smell makes...or it could have been just like it smells and I could have panned it for not tasting like beer. I'm never happy."
"jd"
"Chestnut brown pour with little head, spritzy bubbles, almost coke-like. At first, this seemed like some kind of bock, it was really malty and smoky, lacked the spiciness I expected. Grew on me as the glass wore thin. Solid, just heavy on the malt and had a kind of smoked, toasted character. Fruits like figs, dates, and bananas shined throughout. Had the feel been thicker it would have been very nice."
"M & D - Nice in fluffy, well carbonated and very complex beer. Very drinkable and delicious. Overall its not my favorite of the style but still a solid brew."
"Cheers..."
"D: For what it is, it's pretty drinkable. Not overpowering in sweetness, but it hides the alcohol quite well. The best Lost Abbey beer I've tried to date!"
"Pours dark red/almost brown in color with bubbly off-white head that sticks around for a while. Aroma of dark fruit, syrup, spices, cloves, and burnt sugar. Flavors of spices, dark fruit, slight hops, sugars, molasses, apples dipped in alcohol, raisins, and prunes. Light in body with mild carbonation. A pleasant slow sipper to be savored."
"This is a complex and tasty brew. The sweetness from the raisins and darker malts was not overpowering, but contributed a lot to the overall character of the beer. A great sipper by the fire."
"- I would say a very drinkable dubbel enjoyed with a mild dessert as the sweetness will combine very well... enjoy"
"Poured a dark brown with orange highlights with a thin head that left very little sticky lacing on the glass. The nose consisted of slight belgian yeast notes figs, raisins, slight spice and brown sugar with some underlying booze notes. There also seems to be faint chocolate and coffee notes. Upfront the dark fruits and candy sugar strike first on the palate with chocolate, slight coffee, and malty accents which also had a little booze on the back end. The brew was medium body with a moderate amount of carbonation that had a sweet silky and slight boozy finish. It drank quite well but wasn't as potent on the flavor as I thought it would be for a dubbel. It also seemed to be a little thin for the style as well. I honestly think the bottle version is better IMO."
"An interesting twist inspired by a traditional style results in a kick-ass beer. We dig it. Extremely complex and immensely enjoyable. This beer would be an excellent candidate for a cigar pairing."
"Lost and Found is a nice rendition of the style, but maybe a little light overall. Pretty easy sipper for the style, as it doesn't get so ""dark fruit sweet"" and sticky."
"D- This is a quite tame Dubbel. An easy one to get started on abbey ales with."
"Mouthfeel is on the thicker side and carbonation is moderate to low. Drinkability isn't as high as a lot of Lost Abbey's beers for me. The alcohol shows a bit too much in the finish, and the raisin flavor wasn't one of my favorites. Interesting beer though."
"D: likely a one-and-done beer, first half is pretty nice but gets too heavy throughout, sweetness a little too overhwhelming"
"D: A very easy-drinking 750mL. Could drink plenty of this and enjoy."
"It goes down well though. Glad I tried it."
"this beer need some tweaks to find it identity. perhaps a yeast change and some more carbonation with a push towards a quadrupel."
"Drinkability: Complex for the style and it took me a bit of time to warm up to this beer. It is different from other dubbels I have had. I like the raisin and bread combination. Not sure if I would rush to get this as much as other Lost Abbey beers, but would not pass it over."
"Pours a nice coppery, almost penny-color, with a big head, that lingers for quite a while. Aromas of Belgian spices, raisins, figs and brown sugar. Nicely carbonated, which contributes nicely to its drinkability. Fairly sweet, with caramel and brown sugar initially, and spices and a hit of drying alcohol heat on the back end."
"D: Not good. Luckily I had a friend that will drink anything, otherwise this would have been a drain pour. Can't imagine this is how this beer is supposed to be, that being nearly flat. If so I now know why this abbey was lost. Very disappointed, after looking forward to this brew."
"Overall: The mouthfeel is slightly astringent, carbonated, and edgy. The body of the beer is medium and the finish is medium full. This beer overall is pretty good, it is my first Lost Abby beer. I was a little disappointed I was hoping that is was going to be better."
"Overall, I give this an A. I really enjoyed the overall complexity, and the sweetness was not overpowering. Great job Lost Abbey."
"Overall was another solid offering from Lost Abbey, but it failed to really stand out to me in the style. Worth a look."
"taste was very malty - enjoyed it - banana, clove yeasty and bready. mouthfeel was quite smooth - a tad of bitterness to boot."
"D: Fairly drinkable. Flavorful and complex. Not as harsh as some of these beers."
"F: A little alcohol warmth comes through, still pretty sweet though, some bitterness, with a lingering sweet syrupy taste and some alcohol tingle, as well as some candi sugar taste, the roasted flavors also linger."
"Honestly, while this is a great drinker, at the end of the day since you can get raisin flavors in dubbels without using raisins...why brew one with raisins? That said, this is better than a number of Belgium-brewed dubbels I have had. Good stuff."
"Not a terrific beer, but I liked it. Lost and Found is one of the better American Dubbels out there."
"well, I sure cant go with the flow on this. After the bottle's cracked the beer's happy to see me: it overflow. It's ok. Poured with a big off white head and some lace. Color is a nice rich mahoganey. Aroma is a little raisiny but not as rich as I'd anticipated. Flav is decent but not as big as I'd figured. Good body and carbonation. A little boozy at the end. Not one of my favs, bot not bad."
"Had this on tap at PB Taproom while visiting in San Diego. Tapped into a goblet, beautiful dark ruby beer with thick white head. The nose is raisins, caramel, fig, really nice. Has a nice creamy mouthfeel and a touch of sourness to balance the slightly sweet flavor of roasted malts, chocolate/caramel, fig/raisin. Kept sticking my nose in the glass to smell it, marveling after each sip. Really hit the spot on a crystal clear December afternoon. Excellent Cali Abbey Ale"
"A good beer that could use some champagne like liveliness."
"D- A unique take on the style, and a good one from an American brewery. I would say it drinks about right for the ABV and style. Not super memorable, but a decent first beer from Lost Abbey for myself."
"D - This is absolutely spot on for the style. Probably the best American version of an Abbey Dubbel I've ever had. Spice and carbonation make this beer seem like a time tested Belgian classic."
"Draught at the brewery. Brown with a tan head. Fruity, almost tart berry aroma with some light caramel as well. Dry and vinous flavor witha light fruity tartness in the finish. Medium bodied with lots of carbonation. This was a big surprise, a lean, dry, tart dubbel. I could have drank a lot more of this."
"D - Not overpowering, could have a few if I didn't get very bored."
"the cork flies off and almost busts a light bulb, like some shit out of Das Boot. the head is enormous. that is basically all there is to this beer, a creamy cream coloured head. the body is a deep slightly turbid brown. Im going to bump up the appearance grade a small bit because the head is so amazing in texture and colour. the nose is boozy, slightly dry, and not very spicy or fruity sweet. the taste is a sharp bitterness of hops and booze being balanced out by sweet malts. body is too carbonated."
"Just moved to the area and I made my first trip to Holiday Wine Cellar in Escondido, CA, and it is without a doubt the best beer store I have ever been to. It was heaven. I am a fan. Life is good."
"D: Wouldnt want to finish a bottle of this alone. 10-12oz would be plenty for me. I would definately drink this again and I bet when fresh from the brewerey, this beer would really shine."
"A hazy brown colored ale with a very nice puffy light brown to yellowish tan colored head. One of the nicest looking Dubbels I have seen in a while. Smell is sweet and spicy with a lot of coriander in there. Lots of phenols in this one, there is a distinct banana and an apple aroma this hits the nose quite hard. After a while brown sugar and cinnamon are discernible. The taste begins woody and spicy a lot like chewing on cinnamon bark sticks. Quickly the fruitier aspects of this beer make themselves known. Cinnamon bark, apple banana and brown sugar about sum up the taste. The coriander is there but not so strongly as in the scent."
"Wow, I was very impressed with this one. Poured out of a 750ml bottle into a small sniffer. Was very impressed imediately. Smelled of raisons from the get-go. Very strong and pleasant smell. The color is definately cloudy and carmel dark brown. Rainsons and dates come to the tastebuds imediately. A belgian style Dubbel I will definately have again soon."
"Drinkability: A solid interpretation of a classic Belgian trappist ale but I would expect nothing less from the Port. However, I still think the Belgians have the edge in this style. If you can find it (not easy outside the US), then you should damn well try it."
"Overall - A good, if pretty standard, example of a Belgian Dubbel... definitely worth a try though..."
"Poured a medium brown with tan head into a chalice. Aroma is dark fruit with maybe a touch of alcohol. Flavor is similar with lots of dark fruit, a little malt and sweetness, plus a little alcohol warming. As it warmed, I got a little chocolate flavor in the aftertaste. Overall, a very drinkable dubbel that lived up to the hype."
"D - This is a very nice dubbel. Very unique flavor combinations."
"This one tastes very dense. Relatively sweet, those characteristic Belgian sugars. Very high alcohol in this one. I can detect the raisins and a mix of other fruit flavors. Pretty good beer but strong, so bee careful."
"The taste is very light of flavor but its a very full-bodied taste and mouthfeel."
"Very well executed, and easily the peer of the majority of ""authentic"" versions/brewers of the style."
"Tap @ The Local. Poured deep mahogany with ruby edges, very brown. Small off-white head and no lacing. Nutty, caramel malt aroma that is sweet. Raisins and dates are also present, but in a non-sweetened state. Flat mouthfeel with very little carbonation. Kind of heavy but not syrupy. Dense, dark fruit tastes with caramel, however, there is a nice separation of the two and it avoids a ""candy"" flavor. Some occasional roasted malt and brown sugar taste pop in and out. Fig, date, and plum flavors waft in and out as it warms. Its kind of strange, drinks predominantly like a dubbel, but has the hint of a doppelbock."
"- Overall this brew was way too carbonated... I lost the majority of this brew blowing off the excessive head into the sink.... after that each swig foamed like mad, and made it very hard to drink. The flavor wasn't bad, but this onewas kind of a miss."
"The only complaint that I have with this beer is that I think it was under carbonated for the style. It almost felt flat to me."
"D: Delicious beer, highly drinkable."
"drinkability: good"
"taste is tangy, a little thin, nutty, malt, raisins, prunes, spice, and some cocoa."
"This isn't the best Dubbel I have tried, but still a solid beer."
"750mL bottle into 2 DFH Signature glasses shared with rtratzlaff. Pours a dark cloudy brown with a decent light tan head that diminishes to a thin layer and leaves no lacing. Aroma is loads of dried fruits and burnt malts with slight spice. The taste is a decent amount of dried fruits and dark malts. The beer is medium bodied with low carbonation and a slight dryness. This one is descent, but not as good as the other Lost Abbey beers I've tried so far."
"This would be a wonderful dessert beer, but it's close to being even more drinkable than that. Great taste and well-hidden alcohol make this one a keeper."
"MF - full, big body, ample carbonation, very heavy overall.(good thing)"
"If you love to drink boxes of raisons, this is for you. I like the unique aspect of the beer but the lack of carbonation and the thin feel will stop me from purchasing this again."
"Overall this is not the style for me, I can see how people could love a beer like this, but I just do not have the pallet for it."
"I'm usually a sharing person when it comes to beer, but this beer created in me an intense animal protectiveness. I think I snarled at my roommate when he went in for a sip."
"Color is a deep amber with a big creamy and frothy head that lasts a long time. Aroma was that of Belgian yeast with some light raisin notes. Flavor was that of candi sugar, slight chocolate malt and sweet malt and caramel with a light spice also apparent. Full bodied and good carbonation. Not as good as some other Lost Abbey beers but still pretty well done."
"Overall, another great release from this San Diego Microbrewery."
"D: Overcarbonation is a hallmark of Belgian beers, and to my surprise Lost Abbey lands on the right side of the carbonation spectrum for once. This is a very good Belgian-style ale, and I can see myself picking it up again, provided they've got their consistency down and their prices in line with similar offerings from other breweries. There's nothing here that makes it stand out against, say, Unibroue or even the trappist ales."
"A very well made Belgian style beer. Flavor is robust and intensely fruity. Enough complexity to keep me coming back. Definitely a worthwhile find."
"Drinkable and Delicious, Lost Abbey continues to impress me with their unique take on these great belgian styles."
"Nose is of caramel and fruit from the raisins and hints of biscuits. Color was clean and vibrant with little head retention and lacing. Taste was mouthfilling and delicious. Could have a few glasses of this one for sure but better to share with a friend."
"1 more down on my quest to drink the whole lost abbey line.. westsiiiide"
"Mouthfeel is creamy and smooth, light and fluffy. Really delicious, yeast is at just the right level to mesh with the other flavors instead of dominating them. Perfectly executed."
"Drinkability: Good, though I can't see drinking more than one or two of these at a time."
"Not drinkable in the sessionable sense, but it's a beer that would make an excellent nightcap - it makes me wish I was using it as one! For some reason, this beer makes me think it would pair up really well with some plum pudding with lots of Hard Sauce. Still, it was a nice beer to take the edge off an annoying day at work on a rainy Sunday."
"Mmmmm...."
"Tastes like sweet candied plums or sugar coated raisins...whatever, it's sweet, fruity and delicious. Super smooth, mild alcoholic swallow. Intensely flavorful. Mouthfeel is clean and smooth."
"Drinkability - Solid, but the lack of carbonation detracts somewhat. If this was carbonated even half as much as a normal Belgian, it would be close to fantastic."
"I wish to keep this beer on hand.. it was a crowd pleaser for sure."
"This bottle was at least a year old am I'm not sure if more time would have mellowed and helped the cause. Very nice but seemed to suffer a bit in the drinkability category."
"Solid brew."
"A and I were fairly far apart in our assessment of this."
"A solid brew, my first shot at Lost Abbey. Not really what I was expecting, not a 'knock your socks off' experience, but a solid and enjoyable beer nonetheless."
"It's a little too fizzy for me. Quite drinkable, solid beer."
"A fine American made Belgian style Dubbel. Plenty of other examples I enjoy more. Just didn't seem to come together for me."
"Lost & Found is definitely worth picking up. Even if you are in PA and must get a case, do so as you will not regret it."
"As I finish the bottle I'm content to sit in tranquility and reflect on the words printed on its label: ""A life worth living is full of discovery and we are reminded everywhere there is opportunity."" I do raise this glass in a toast ""to patience, perseverance, and all the things we have lost along the way and were somehow lucky enough to find once again."""
"I enjoyed this in its very own glass, ""For Sinners and Saints Alike"". Unwavering three-quarter finger mocha head, small bubble carbonation liberal in circumference with staying power - looks good so far. I can see yeast spots in the glass bottom and the colour is somewhat lighter than a prune nectar. Raisins in the nose, also coriander and yeast. Very smooth mouthfeel strikes an appreciative chord, velvet texture, alcohol hardly noticeable in my cellar tempurature brew. Taste is spiced apple and raisins but mostly mincemeat tart, perhaps a dash of pepper but softer, maybe a lemon pepper flash here and there. Delightful and very much reminiscent of its Belgian cousins, what a treat, thanks to my beer buddy for a taste of this one that he acquired in a trade. Amen!"
"I was on the fence about Dubbels, haven't really been my favorite style as they always seemed a bit messy to me in terms of flavor profiles. Given a bit more time and more experience with this style, I like to think that my tastebuds are maturing to this style, as this one I enjoyed and could readily appreaicate some of the subtler nuances of this beer."
"D - It's ok, not sure that I would seek this out again, but wouldn't turn it down if it's all there was."
"The head fades quickly to a sturdy surface layer, leaving some tight lattice. The aroma is dark fruit with plums and red grapes and raisins mixing. First sip reveals an average body with fine tingly carbonation. Flavor is similar to nose with dark fruit, plums and raisins, and a bit of doughy yeast on the finish. The beer is very drinkable with no hints of hops or ABV. Quite a nice rich enjoyable brew."
"This isn't the clouds-open-up-and-cry beer I've been hoping for from the Abbey, but it's another I'd happily have again. Good dubbel with a unique flavor profile."
"An interesting enough brew. One that I would have been glad to split, but was able to gradually, slowly, sip away. A nice enough attempt at the style, and one that I enjoyed smelling more than drinking. There is a rawness/greenness to it."
"Unfortunately, another Lost Abbey that falls too far from style guidelines, which could be ok, but flavors do not integrate well at all, and the lack of carbonation deliver the last blow."
"D- This one grew on me quite a bit as I was drinking it. Overall, pretty easy to drink."
"A fizzy inch of biscuity tan head fades quickly and leaves no lace. Body is a very deep consistant prune like brown in color. You get some crisp dark fruit up front on the nose, then comes the toffee malts all wraped up in spicy yeast. That same spicy yeast feel is the first thing you notice when you take first sip. This is a more dusty dry spice feel though. There is a consistant dark fruit sweetness full of fresh raisens and plum on the back of the palate. This brew really does get better as it warms. Mouthfeel is very yeasty thick with some even sweetness. Sweetness is lingering and hurts the drinkability slightly."
"Flavor is sweet and tart - indeed raisin-like. Tastes good, although kind of delicate/light. Nice balance of malt to fruit. Feels pretty good. Full side of thin bodied."
"Pours a very dark ruby red/ purplish-prune color with nice sized off-white foam head that settes into a lasting lacing. Aroma is dominated by dark fruit with a nice alcohol presence Perfect blend of maltiness and sweet dark fruit flavors such as raisin, date, prune and fig with a nice alcohol warmth in the finish. Amazing beer!"
"Sipping reveals plenty of dried dark fruits such as fig and raisin. Comes of less sweet than anticipated given the scent. Finishes with a semi dry spiciness paired with a warming alcohol presence and tobacco. Medium bodied and less carbonated than some of its Belgian counterparts. This unique dubbel comes off as an interesting mix of dubbel and old ale. I had hoped for a little more from this famed brewery, but it is surely a beer worth trying."
"Good beer. I've been looking forward to drinking a lost abbey beer for a long time. This is my first one and although it is a good beer, I expected it to be better. I do taste the raisins and it does have a unique flavor, but after visiting Dogfish Head, I don't think it's as complex or tasty as some of their beers. Has a great flavor and a great after taste, I was just hoping for more. Improves as it warms and I would rather drink this than most dubbels I've had, which I feel it shares color and some of the flavor profile. My expectations were probably unreachable, and it met about 80% of it."
"Drinkability - couldn't have more than one or maybe two in a sitting, this one is a slow sipper"
"Notes from 9/18/08"
"Overall: Quite unimpressive, and probably my least favorite of the Lost Abbey beers I've had. Not quite a drainpour, but absolutely not something I'd buy again. I have to wonder at the ratings on this beer, and whether it gets some high ones due to a certain degree of beer geek adoration that LA enjoys."
"HV"
"Drinkability is okay, a pretty good dubbel, a bit sugary for the style, but it suits my taste nicely, great esters and well made."
"A rusty amber pour with a big creamy head that seems to remain forever. Light, refreshing scents of sweet fruits, slightly dark. Some raisin and fig of course with a brown and candy sugar presence. Caramel and a light spice also apparent. Flavor is very rich when compared to the nose. Much more full than expected. Big and malty with the fruits and lots of caramel and brown sugar. Also some chocolate. Light yeast and spice with a slight alcohol burn as well. Creamy, full mouth with a spicy finish and a touch of alcohol again. Decent drinkability. Seems like an after dinner drink to me. Nothing spectacular here."
"Overall, this is a great example of the style. Tons of flavor and another great beer by Lost Abbey."
"D- Another solid beer from Lost Abbey. I am a huge fan of beers this style, and this is a fantastic domestic version of the dubbel style. Recommended!"
"A very enjoyable Dubbel, and I will certainly pick it up again when Lost Abbey hits Chicago."
"Poured a burnt orange color on the pour with a small tannish head. Nose was sticky w/ dried fruits(prunes, raisins,figs). Lots of caramel, and candied fruits, brown sugar. Taste was sweet and rummy, lots of dried fruits and sweet candy. I found it hard to drink and not tasty at all. I thought the taste was ob noxious and unpleasant. I am not sure how anyone could finish a bottle of this."
"Overall, a pretty good beer but it was missing a solid flavor to it. I'd recommend if you can easily get but don't kill yourself getting it."
"Excellent depiction of the genre... One of the best Dubbels' I've sampled, period..."
"I look forward to trying more brews from Port/Lost Abbey."
"D: Not the best dubbel, but boy that aroma."
"Pours darker than I was expecting with a reddish hue to it. Smell is dark fruits, but to my pleasant surprise there was a bit of sourness to it. This has a huge mouthfeel and is very pleasant. There are plenty of juicy, dark fruits in this offering. This may be my favorite Lost Abbey beer to date. You never notice the ABV. The complexity in this beer is very nice and everything works wonderul together. Very well done."
"D - A decent dubbel but I was expecting a little more. Not as complex as some of the better ones on the market and slightly bland and boring."
"Overall a very enjoyable beer demonstrating that Americans are coming into their own, capable of brewing a superior Belgian while hinting at possibilities of the US turning the style into its own as it has with so many other styles."
"Drinkability is very good as well and if it were lower in alcohol, I could drink it all night."
"I'm glad I tried the bottle, which more than made up for the disgusting tap experience. Not sure why all that sediment was in that one. I would have taken it back, but the Toronado bartenders are so surly they probably would have kicked me out of the bar for complaining."
"Reviewed this before out of the bottle. This time I'm reviewing it on tap at Toronado in San Francisco. Pours a murky brown with no real head but some spotty lacing. The aroma is light, but there is some earthiness and a touch of chocolate. The taste is rich and chocolaty with typical Belgian yeast flavors of clove, herbal flavors, pear, and banana. The mouthfeel is smooth and perfectly carbonated. Extremely easy to drink. Doesn't come as well as in the bottle as far as appearance or aroma goes, but perhaps superior in smoothness and flavor on tap."
"D- Very drinkable. I normally nurse Belgian styles, but this was going down quite easy."
"Smooth as silk and a very satisfying body and level of carbonation. Easily drinkable and an amazing beer, easily one of, if not the best Belgian-style beers in America. In fact, it could possibly be that the capital of Belgium is located not in Flanders, but North County SD."
"D: Pangs of regret filled me when the bottle was emptied. Luckily this one is easier to find that a lot of the Lost Abbey's offerings. A good dubbel."
"D- This a nice beer and I recommend it to someone who has never tasted a beer that has been brewed with raisens in it."
"Pours a murky mahogany color, average sized tan head fades into a 1/4"" layer on top of the beer, a few stray spots of sticky lacing on the glass. Smells of raisins, brown bread, some sweet molasses. Taste is very rich malt, sweet/dark fruits, brown sugar, and just a nice hint of alcohol. Medium-bodied, relatively fizzy carbonation, some nice lingering spice. This is tasty...nothing too overwhelming, and this would pair really nicely with food."
"WOuld like this at port brewery on tap next!"
"750ml bottle: This one pours an opaque, reddish-brown color. There was a decent sized tan head on the pour, but it dropped away rather quickly. Very nice nose. Raisins, rum, caramel, slight spiciness, a mix of some other fruits and some other unidentifiable sources of sweetness. The taste is very good. There is a lot going on in there, but you can pick out some raisin, caramel, dark fruits, and I believe a touch of roastiness just trying to peak out. Very Nice!"
"D - Excellent I can't wait to break out my next bottle and will be ordering more"
"Drinks pretty easy for the style & ABV, One you could savor all night, if lucky enough to find it in quantity. A good bordering on great Dubbel, nuff said. Would happily drink again"
"Not a mindblowing dubbel, but a pretty good one, in my opinion, and a good first experience with the Lost Abbey."
"D: Nice beer. After older viscosity it went down a little to easy. Perfect example of the style. Spot on actually. Nice beer. Too bad it is hard to come by in NY."
"750ml bottle from South Bay. Pours a deep copper amber with a beige head that leaves only minimal lacing as it recedes. Smell is huge with dark fruits, plums and figs, also spicy and bready. Taste is big with figs and raisins, also some nice bready malt. Finish is sweet with a fruity aftertaste. Really delicious. Mouthfeel is good but to nitpick I'd like a little more carbonation to help clean off some of the sweetness. As a result, drinkability suffers but only slightly. Great brew yet again from Lost Abbey."
"Drinkability is good. This is a solid Belgian Dubbel. Not quite world class, but still very solid and worth a try."
"Thanks to Tradehops for this one; my bottle reads 8% abv. Interesting muddy-brown color, oily head with minimal bubbles. The smell is nice, cinnamon toast, nuts, raisins, sweets, root beer candies, and maybe some alcohol. Slightly spicy flavor and the raisins are present."
"D - I expected a little more out of this one and felt it could have been a winter wheat wine. The esters were not very apparent either."
"If I lived where this is sold, it would find it's way in my DBF with regularity."
"Pours clear dark brown with a thin creme head that falls to nothing pretty fast. Nice sugary and spicy nose. I really do wish I knew my spices better because I feel like I should be able to pinpoint this somehow. Flavor is smoothly sweet, though a tad of tang is there. Spices are clearly evident, but don't overpower. It's got some nice character to it. Feel has a fairly full carbonation and the liquid is decent. This is a pretty easy drinker. There is some good character on it and it's definitely not boring. Mind blowing? No. Nice to drink? Sure."
"Overall this was a fantastic beer from Lost Abbey. There was a nice touch of dark fruit and a really great light profile. This was just another in a long series of solid brews from Tomme and company. I was again just thought this was wonderful. Definitely one of the best dubbels I have had."
"Picked up a bottle of this in light of the fact that I will be doing a trade soon for another Lost Abbey brew. Pour is interesting in that there is little to no heading, but the look of it is still worth noting. Looks very thick and murky. Color is a reddish brown. Aroma is sweet and spicy at the same time, with essences of dark stone fruits, cracked pepper, and an appealing boozy character. Taste really shows off the raisin puree created for this beer, with hints of chocolate and other fruits lingering in the background. Feel is on the medium side, and is just about right for this style. One bottle was far too easy to suck down. I like the fact that despite this is a sweet Dubbel, it is not overkill, with lots of other complexities to consider. A good American interpretation of this style. Bring on GOTM."
"D- pretty good, one of the better lost abbeys ive had"
"D: Very drinkable and well balanced beer. I wonder if this is one that would grow better with a little more time in the bottle? Very good beer overall."
"M/D: Full bodied, other then a dry quality, the alcohol is hidden, carbonation right on spot. Fair drinkability as well. Overall a solid beer, a little different then most dubbles I have had."
"I'm a huge fan of Port Brewing Company/The Lost Abbey and am not about to hold a less than optimally carbonated beer against them. Rest assured that I will locate another Lost & Found Abbey Ale one of these days and will, no doubt, increase the scores to their rightful places soon thereafter."
"Pours a muddy caramel color with some yeast in the glass. Nice beige head. Smell is oddly refreshing and minty with some alcohol presence. Taste is rather mundane with perhaps a hint of belgian yeast, light malt flavor, and again an alcohol presence that comes through as almost minty again. Drinkable, and not really offensinve, as the flavor is so mild, but nothing really screamed great beer about this one, to me."
"I need to grab a few bottles and let them sit for 3 to 6 years, then this will be perfect when it really shows up its wine-like qualities."
"Dark brown. Small head settles down quickly, easily revived with a swirl of the glass. Good retention as well. Raisin in the aroma, dark malts, dark sugars, very fruity with dark fruits dominant. A dark dubble. True to style, but for me it doesn't add up to anything overly impressive. Mouthfeel and carboantion levels are both good. Drinkability is not the best for me as I just kinda find this one of the more boring example of the style. Now, Benediction on the other hand ;-)"
"D: Drinks pretty easy for a dubbel and the lower ABV helps that. The brew was tasty but not as as potent at most are... though the alcohol was more so... haha, weird, I know. Since there are better and readily available dubbels in my area, I probably won't go back to this. Glad I could try it and was definitely worth my time. Thanks again, Chris."
"I picked up a bottle at the Table & Vine in Springfield MA. By every sense I employed, I would have guessed this to be Ommegang in a blind taste test. That's a good thing, just not too original (and a lot pricier from the Lost Abbey). The beer is dark brown colored, hazy, almost no head. The aroma is dark fruits (figs, plums, raisins) and some sweet esters. The taste is the same, possibly a hint of anise as well. The mouthfeel is thicker than water but not overly so, easily drinkable. Nice overall, but Ommegang is a better price and similar experience."
"Good flavor throughout, but just a bit too much alcohol came through which prevented this one from ranking higher on the drinkability meter."
"Poured into a chalice. Pours a reddish brown. Smell is sweet fruits, cloves and molasses. Taste was more the same, but a little muted. This was a good beer, but whenever I drink it I get the feeling it is missing just a little something to make it great, and that it would be good blended with a sour beer. I therefore am not surprised to learn that this serves as a base for some other great Lost Abbey beers."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied and smooth with a forward carbonation that works really well into the overall beer. An easy drinking dubbel that is nice and flavorful. This is another enjoyable brew from Lost Abbey. If you can get this locally and easy you should feel lucky, as this is one I would definitely drink again."
"In both the flavor and aroma of this beer, I'm somewhat surprised to see so many distinct ingredients in other reviws. Unlike most Lost Abbey brews, I find this beer is decidedly ""one-note."" And that note is pureed raisins mixed with roasted malt. That's ... about it. Maybe a hint of something lighter, perhaps grapefruit or pine needles. Beer pours a pleasant enough reddish hue, but just not one of my favorites from Lost Abbey."
"Pours a hazed brownish red, almost rust coloured, thin off white head forms, leaves a solid ring, some lace spots on the glass. Smell is caramel, raisins, some citrus, nice malts, grains, figs, yeasty bread, light chocolate, nice. Taste is similar, very raisiny, caramel, some alcohol, light chocolate, citrus, some wood, dark fruits, yeast, smooth flavours. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium carbonation, pretty nice to drink, a solid dubbel."
"Needed to try this so I could compare it to Amazing Grace when I crack it open soon, not great but a decent dubbel, would pick other Lost Abbey beers before it in the future, worth a try though"
"D: Very drinkable. I would like another please"
"Overall: A nice dubbel with a great nose and taste. Lost Abbey knows what they are doing when it comes to Belgian brews and this is a fine example of the class. Defiently worth the try."
"Overall, this is a great abbey-style ale, and the use of raisins is a real highlight. Easily the best dubbel that I've had from a US brewery."
"D: This is really an excellent dubbel. It has all the elements of a good Belgian, and the raisin compote gives it an added dimension that you don't always see. Probably TLA's best year-round brew. One bottle has me pretty buzzed so I don't know that this would be a good session beer, but it can be sipped or drank a little faster. Awesome stuff, I'm glad I can find this locally."
"Decent mouthfeel. I wish I could recommend it more but im not a huge fan of belgians. I can see how people would really like this, for a beer style im not to into, it does have a lot of flavor."
"Beer poured a deep mahogany with a nice tan head that quickly dissapated. Nose is of molasses and Belgian yeast. Taste is of those Belgian yeast, molasses, candied sugar, and perhaps a dark fruit. Mouthfeel is nicely conditioned by the yeast strain as it glides easily across my palate. Drinkability is very good. This is not an overly complex brew for the style but it is very easy to drink. Nice representation of style!"
"The subdued character which works so well as a base for other Lost Abbey blends seems almost here. Interesting but not something I would chose over most of the other Lost Abbey line."
"Pours a cloudy deep amber color with a light tan head. In the aroma, sour, hints of cherries and raisons. In the taste, sour, light maltiness and nice small fruity hints. A smooth, small tartness in the mouthfeel and a dry tartness of raisons in the aftertaste. A nice sour, nice fruitiness, good dry presence."
"Pours a murky dark brown/red. One finger fluffy head dissipates to a ring with thin layer of foam. Nose is malty with dark fruit flavors and light yeast tones. Up front the taste is dark fruit. raisin and some date or fig. malts balance the middle with a nice hop lick on the finish. mouthfeel is very nice, maybe just a touch thin. Drinkability is quite high. A very good belgian style dubbel. I am impressed with my first taste from the lost abbey. This left me looking for and wanting more, the lost abbey truly is the perfect name!"
"Wow, tasty treat dupple."
"Pours a dark mahogany with a pillowy off-white one finger head that dies down to a thin layer of everlasting bubbles. Stickiness is mediocre but there. Smell is sweet caramel apple with a rich raisin aroma. Full of thick malt in the nose, very enjoyable. Not too yeasty in the nose, just how I like my Belgians. A faint floral perfume scent tickles the senses as well. Creamy dark fruits up front on the tongue: raisin, dates, plum, and cherries. Some biscuit flavors and walnuts as well. Caramel sweetness throughout with a mild vanilla aftertaste. Solid Belgian flavor brewed in the good US of A. Fluffy cloud mouthfeel with a smooth carbonation. Very close to the Westy 8 in texture, damn good. Amazing how this one goes down for 8%. Lost Abbey clearly knows what their doing, this is a damn fine beer. Looking forward to trying the Amazing Grace."
"This one poured a clear, reddish brown with a cream coloured head. The cap was a bit thin and made up of fine bubbles. It eventually settled to a ring and produced some sticky lace. The aroma was full of cakey, doughy malt and dried fruit - raisins mostly. There was also some yeast character and a bit of alcohol. The flavour was a combination of malt and fruit with a hint of alcohol, sort of like a fruitcake. It was quite bready with mild chocolate and cocoa notes, along with sweet prunes, cherries, and sultana raisins in the finish. Medium/light bodied with lowish carbonation, the bubbles were well-integrated and quite fine. The texture was quite good with a little warmth throughout. Very tasty overall. Even though the alcohol was always present, it was never distracting or hot. I really enjoyed the rich, dried fruit character too. Definitely a winner."
"D: Nice dubbel with a decent kick, pleasant flavor and reasonably complex profile. I will keep a couple in my stash for tasting in a year or so...this one will improve with age."
"Edit: With the last pour, the appearance immediately became cloudy due to the sediment and that always means, for me, a better score in appearance for the style. Also, all of the flavours seem to have intensified bringing much more goodness to my palate. Why is it that the bottom third of a bottle of a Belgian or Belgian style ale always is the best part of the bottle??? Anywho, I've adjusted my rating accordingly."
"d: Glad I had some help from alhrabosky for this one. While I enjoyed this well enough I won't seek it out again."
"The beer pours a translucent, dark brown color with a 1/4"" tan head that quickly fades to spotty lacing. The aroma is good. It has a warm, malty scent that boasts of raisins and figs along with roasted and crystal malts. It's sweet and fruity with a warm alcohol feel; very nice. The taste is great. It has a very smooth, malty flavor that's sweet and full of crystal malts as well as a bit of roasted malts. The yeast provides a wonderful palate of raisins and figs. It's fruity yet mellowing and well received with the malt bill. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a very nice beer. It's well balanced and highly drinkabe; an excellent dubbel."
"Overall a very good beer, my first from ""The Lost Abbey"". I can't wait to try some more"
"Poured into a chalice a nice mahongy color, nice carbonation, awesome two-finger plus very creamy tan head, tons and tons of creamy/sticky lacing follows. The nose is malty, raisins, prunes, figs, and some caramel. The taste is awesome, malty, dark fruits galour, and a nice touch of caramel. Full body. Very drinkable, another awesome brew from Lost Abbey, highly recommended."
"Drinkability was solid. Very refreshing after a long day of driving"
"D: Another tasty, good beer from Lost Abbey, another great Belgian-style beer from these West Coast producers, very easy to drink, for an alcoholic Belgian brew."
"The beer dispenses from the cork and caged 750ml bottle a hazy reddish brown with a substantial creamy light to medium tan head that dematerializes leaving the lace to surround the glass. Nose has a nice fruity aroma, malt and a bit of molasses, quite sniffable. Start has a substantial grain presence, sweet and fruity at the front with a bit of alcohol bitterness at the back, top falls in the moderate range. Finish is prickly in its acidity, the hops pleasantly spicy, with the pesky alcohol bite lingering till the end, dry and a masterful brew tis true."
"My first Lost Abbey taste, and I'm pretty impressed. The raisin idea is hardly new, but it's well-executed here. I'm only a little let down that this brew doesn't pack more punch. Be sure to serve good and warm."
"Mouthfeel is medium-full bodied, boozy, rummy raisins, caramel, light cocoa, along with lightly smoked meat grazing along the tongue."
"Sometimes i wonder if I'm sampling the same product that other BAs are reviewing. Pours a clear dark diluted cola color. I suppose it might appear hazy from certain aspects viewed through the effects of a convex...whatever. As the beverage passes onto your tongue, with your lips on the rim and your nose in the goblet your senses detect something very similar. A rich semi-sweet chocolate NECCO wafer malty aroma and flavor persist. A chalky earthy malt dominates one hunting for hints of sweeter figgyness. Light-Medium bodied, the mouth feel is slightly under carbonated. A reasonable drinker. Glad that i had the opportunity to try it. (hype factor)"
"I believe this is the basis for some of the even heavier offerings from Lost Abbey (10 Commandments/Judgment Day), this is a very solid Belgian-style Dubbel from a highly respected SoCal brewery, I would definitely recommend picking this up (I believe L&F is the prototypical L.A. beer) and look forward to reviewing 10 Commandments shortly"
"I think this is the best U.S. dubbel style, I have ever tried.Now that Ive tried this,I will pick up some more LA beers next time I need my belgian fix.The only thing that keeps me from drinking this beer fast is typing this review.Its very drainkable and I dont feel the effects yet and im on my first glass."
"Smooth mouthfeel that is crisp and refreshing at the same time. Overall this is a fantastic interpretation of the style while being unique. Highly recomended."
"Poured into a Chimay goblet. This beer pours a clear but dark brown, slightly red, with an airy but dense thick head. The head formed very easily on this. The smell is almost wine-like, probably because of the raisins. Alcohol might be there slightly. The taste is very good. Malty with a dark fruity sweetness at the start, finishing with an earthiness reminiscent of Belgian beers."
"Thanks, ppoitras, for the opportunity"
"Pours medium to dark brown with a reddish hue. Foamy off-white head that starts off about an inch thick with very good head retention and an almost continuous lace up the back of the glass. The smell is lightly malty and sour with clear ripe fruit overtones, though I can't quite put my finger on a specific fruit. Also maybe a little bread in the nose. The taste is where this one really shines. Nicely balanced slightly bitter initial flavor that has the expected yeast sourness of a Belgian style ale. Interesting warm fruity aftertaste that reminds me of rum. The aftertaste morphs into a more sour malty flavor that is a little bitter. The only downside to this beer is the mouthfeel. It is nice and full-bodied, but I found it to be a little sudsy in texture, though it didn't bother me until I got to considering it for the review. Overall, this is a nice, complex beer that should definitely be tried. The yeast sourness and ripe fruit aromas and flavors are clear, but there is an interesting flavor/nose between initial flavor and aftertaste that I had trouble describing. Like every Lost Abbey brew I have had, this is well worth trying."
"Belgian bomber, caged and corked, w/o freshness/bottling info. Pours dark milk chocolate brown, moderate murkyness, with a mocha head, so so retention, minor film and next to no lacing. Seems to be quite low in the carbonation department. Nose here is of traces of chocolate, light raisins and perhaps some earthyness. Another simply delicious creation to savor. Light raisins, more chocolate, toffee, gingerbreddy malts, yum...complex, subtle,mellow, smooth, coating and highly enjoyable suds...another reason to move closer to Lost Abbey/Pizza Port and San Diego, Ca."
"I almost feel had. The aroma set me up, expecting some good things, but the flavor doesn't live up to the promise. Simply, I wanted more of what the aroma brought to the table. The ABV is chunky and very warm, and does its part to limit the drinkability. It once was lost, and now it's found, I guess, and I'm okay with that, but I'm surely not awed."
"$4 or $5, on tap, definitely."
"Bottle: Poured a deep cloudy brown color ale with a big foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of dry fruits and candi sugar is quite enjoyable. Taste is also dominated by some sweet malt with candi sugar and some notes of dry figs and raisins are also noticeable. Body is quite full with some good carbonation and no alcohol was discernable. I thought this was well done overall but lacked some complexities to take it to a greater level."
"A great dubbel only limited in my view by the purchase price of $11.65."
"A nice dubbel, but a bit excessive in the alcohol flavor department. The aroma is wonderful, but it could benefit from having those differing flavors mirrored to some extent in the taste. I'm not sure if I'll pick up this one again, but this has piqued my interest in trying other Lost Abbey beers."
"The beer is a bit simple and one dimensional on the palate, but the flavors are very nice, making this a fun beer to drink. Another solid effort from Port Brewing."
"The beer is a dark reddish color with a one finger head. The aroma is mostly malt and raisins and is very sweet. There is a bit of spice to the flavor along with the malt and raisin flavor. It is a bit too spicy for my taste. The mouthfeel is pretty good. It is fairly light bodied. It is a good decent overall."
"Strong spicy flavors up front, almost gingery; the flavor settles into nice brown malts (I'm thinking dark crystal and some chocolate malt). Strong alcohol oiliness which is surprising given the content. Good body with very high carbonation."
"Overall a good beer. A little too sweet on the finish, but drinkable and enjoyable."
"D: This is a fairly drinkable beer. The very complex flavors are balanced and smooth. This is a good beer and a nice attempt at the style. I will have a Chimay Première and Westmalle Dubbel over the next week or so in order to compare."
"The beer arrived in a 750 ml. Corked and caged bomber, and looked brownish orange in color when poured. The head atop it was beige, a little shy of two finger thick, and craggy. The smell was lighter than I was expecting, with a floral and soured fruit profile. The taste was sweet and rummy, and not quite as dry as the true Belgian examples I've sampled before. The carbonation was prickly in the mouth as result of the thinner than normal body, and the alcohol was also quite evident. Despite some of these flaws making this a little abnormal for the style, I found it was an overall enjoyable beer."
"750 ml. bottle- color of reddish mahogany , with a thick small bubbled tan head - nose of spices (orange , cloves) , yeast , bright red fruit , brown sugar, malts , and beef broth  taste of red fruit , cloves , yeast , red grapefruit , and candied/dried apricots - body is medium , smooth , and with high carbonation  aftertaste of red fruit , molasses , and light hops"
"D-Not bad for the style, though something appears to be amiss here. Not quite sure what it is. I would try this again though."
"Drinkability- Hits reall hard for a dubbel and has the most flavor I've ever had per style besides maybe Westy 8....nice company for sure as that was my favorite dubbel. Matched if not better than my previous favorite amercian dubbel (RR Benediction)."
"This is a flavorful beer that's worthy of a beer purchase and a good beer over all. It's not one of the top beers for the style though."
"All in all a strong brew, especially for a California dubbel. However, it really lacks confidence. The flavors are all enjoyable but perhaps too well rounded- nothing stands out. The color is moderate, even the head doesn't stick around long enough to enjoy. It definitely has some potential for aging, but it won't ever be spectacular- something which I have no doubt this brewery is capable of producting."
"Drinkability: This is tough. While I COULD drink more of these because it's relatively easy to drink there's not manyt reasons why I would want to. Maybe to see if the second is better than the first."
"What a great tasting beer. Poured into my tulip glass with a dark raisin color, topped off with a fairly decent, lingering tan head. This is one of the best smelling beers yet, with banana bread hitting you right away, followed by malts and brown sugar. This beer could be made into incense...Tasted of dark fruits (the raisin mixture they add contributes to some great flavoring) malt, and again, subtle hints of brown sugar and fresh wheat bread. The mouth feel was fairly substantial, but the beer is so good that two 22oz bottles wouldn't be a problem. Pairs with the usual dubbel suspects- mild flavorful cheeses- though it would be a great after dinner finisher...Enjoy"
"Mouthfeel is full with the massive tiny carbonation."
"Altogether a solid effort by the wonderful folks at Lost Abbey."
"This was one of the sweetest Belgium beers I ever had, on tap at Solena Beach. I declined a bottle purchase. It is amber red with lots of lace, very fresh. Fresh yeast aroma. WIll it get less candy after ageing? That would help. Good body, but only sweetness dominates and its cloying."
"This offering from The Lost Abbey pours a clear auburn with small carbonation bubbles throughout that leave a thick tan head that quickly disappears. The aroma is funky, sour, horse blanket, caramel, vanilla, some pepper, and nice herbal spices throughout the nose. The taste starts sweet upfront, caramel, malt bomb, dark pitted fruit, plums, raisins, followed by a sour unripened twang in the finish. This overall beer is good, a little alcohal strong for 7% that could mellow possible with age."
"Sampled from bottle at the Monk's Cafe Lost Abbey dinner the other night. This was paired along side the Amazin Grace brew. The beer poured a deep amber colored body with a medium thickness tan head. The nose has a malty sweet character with some fruits notes to boot. The taste is more of the same with a nice malt profile and some dried fruit characters as well."
"D: Low abv makes this a very drinkable beer. Soft on the palate. An excellent dubbel even at the price. Well worth the it. Glad I snagged this when I did."
"Drinkability is excellent. One of the better lost abbey beers and a quite authentic Belgian Dubbel."
"D- This is a very tasting brew and glad I got one for myself (nearly didn't). I will be picking more of this up next time I go down to Cali."
"One bomber of this is more than enough beer for one night, and while the beer is definitely above average and especially worthy of praise for a California-made dubbel, I don't have any burning desire to try it again any time soon. However, given that the alcohol burn is the main deterrent, this may be the perfect candidate to go into hibernation for 6 months to a year or so and see how it ages."
"The body is thick and creamy with a fairly sharp and prickly carbonation. Very enjoyable. Could be more drinkable without the slight bitter aftertaste of pennies."
"Poured in a heavy glass chalice, formed a 1/2"" tan head over the clear burgundy brew. Head dwindles quickly and loudly, not unlike a soda's froth, with no lacing whatsoever. Aroma is sweet and spicy, with sedate dark fruitiness. Taste is malty upfront, with spicing coming on strong in the middle, carrying on to the close, where the fruit enters the picture as well. Mouthfeel seems carbonated to a fault, hard to get a handle on the flavors around all the bubbles on the tongue, and reasonably nice and drinkable. Not quite what I was hoping for, but still a sturdy representative of the style."
"Highly recommended."
"Beer is good. Happy dubbel beering."
"Very effervescent on the tongue and perfect for the upcoming holidays. I'll be aging several bottles of this to see how it comes out. Do yourself a favor and get some of this."
"Purchased: Plaza Liquors, Tucson AZ"
"Ruby red in appearance with a thick, off-white head. Nose is spicy and bready, with hints of figgish fruit. My first impression of the flavor was that it was big and nicely well-rounded. Slightly sweet and bready with toasty caramel malts, hints of molasses, and a cinnamon and balanced hop finish. Substantial, but not overwhelming in mouthfeel. A good beer, with decent complexity."
"Mouth: Very malt forward, yet not as sweet as the aroma would imply. Actually a little strange, it's somewhat dry up front and has a wet finish. Roast malt flavors touched up with a slight hop bitterness give this one a lasting after taste. Up front there's not a whole lot going on, though it's really enjoyable and drinkable. Also, mouthfeel, though it enters quite aggressively, but the time it reaches the back it's settled and feels a bit weak."
"D: Nice beer, good drinkability. A bit too sweet which might chill out with age. Still worth trying"
"Of the two, I purchased the Avant Garde was the winner, but I'll definitely be picking this up again."
"A first-rate dubbel which will always have a place in my cellar."
"A decent attempt at the style, but far from the best. The mouthfeel is pretty weak in comparison, but decent overall. Definitely worth a try or two, although I probably won't buy this one again."
"Notes: This is right down the description line for the style and comes through with flying colors. Rich malts with some fruity tones and enough roasted characteristics to keep things somewhat in check and with depth. Good."
"Overall: Whilst I felt a little let down by the earlier Avant Garde, the Lost & Found is a far better offering and has the background and depth that I have come to expect from Port Brewing. I would definitely pick this one up again, in fact, I just may, tomorrow! Something tells me that this will be better fresh though; I wouldnt leave this one in the cellar."
"Drinkability  This is not a big monster Belgian. It goes down well and quite easy and is a good one for sharing maybe with someone new to the style."
"this goes down easy, but i am having more fun sipping it slowly. nice to have a flavorful belgian clocking in at a mere 7%, i can quaff this infinitely into the evening. one bottle left and it's gonna sit for a few months. given time and a few adjustments overall this beer will be world class pizza port (edit: the last reviewer said the same thing. fuck it, i agree!). cheers to lost abbey. head and shoulders above the painfully mediocre avant garde."
"I think this beer might make a decent session beer. It dosent seem to be too high in alcohol, and the flavor is not too aggressive. I think it is a good beer, and one that I look forward to trying more as Port Brewing progresses."
"Plenty of body and a fair bit of alcohol, this has a nice smooth and creamy mouthfeel. Can't wait to go back and have another...cheers!"
