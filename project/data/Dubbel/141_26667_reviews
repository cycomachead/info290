"Overall this is a serviceable brew but nothing special.  Glad I had the opportunity to try it."
""
""
""
"Not too much spice. Still tastes like beer. Tasted stale! Like old Bud light!"
"Overall- Nice domestic interpretation of a Dubbel"

"Malty and roasted flavors were smooth and enjoyable.  Very easy drinking winter ale on a cold evening."
""
""
"   Overall, a 3.75 for Smuttynose Winter Ale - Smuttynose Brewing Company. I may or may not buy this again."
""
""
""
""
"Dark red body with a tan head and spotty lace.. A/T toasted malt, syrup sweetness, slight chocolate, earthy bitterness lingers on the back on the tounge.. Smooth body.. Great beer that I could care less what the style is or what it is trying to be, it's just a great beer."
"Some spicy notes but not bad overall"
""
""
""
"Deep, chocolate brown with decent tan head and minimal lacing. Aroma is of roasted malt, actually quite light. Taste is strong up front with malt and roasted malt. Also, a little alcohol burn as it settles in, and some dry spice at the finish. Mouthfeel is ok, carbonation is right on, and balance is good...."

"Great look and smell to this winter ale. Taste is a little buttery."
""
""
"Overall this is a well balanced hoppy and malty Dubbel.  I don't normally care much for this style but I would drink this again."
""
""
""
""
""
"Somewhat similar to a Dark Belgian Ale. Nice malt mouthfeel. A taste of dried raisins that fades into dark espresso and then into Belgian chocolate. This is definitely a nice winter warmer. I would recommend this beer for when you are sitting in front of a fire in a lightly dimmed room."

"Overall a great beer with an original label."

"Nobody gave this beer a narrative review.  Not a good sign.  Smuttynose can make good beer, I've had many of them.  However, if their winter offering is a 5.83% ""Trappist Ale"" that nobody will take the time to write anything about, that tells you something.  This may be due to Smutty fans not wanting to badmouth their brewery, which is admirable and understandable.  However, a belgian dubbel for the cold season at 5.83% was a mistake.  They would have been more honest to make a diet cola instead.  What a waste of kettle space.  Yes, session beers are in, but not for the winter, and certainly not belgian dubs.  The caption shows ""warming, mellow,pleasantly complex.""  Yeah, warming.  Should have been released as a brown ale, a bad one at that.  You have to nail holiday/winter beers.  Did you really think that this would stand out, or didn't you care?  The Monks are crying tonight.  Sorry."

"DATE TASTED: April 23, 2014... GLASSWARE: Kisatsky Tavern pint... OCCASION: Easter The Desolation of Smaug on spring break--thanks, Shan!... APPEARANCE: velvety dark amber red body; frothy, creamy off-white head; strong, cloudy lacing... AROMA: doughy, bready malts early; cinnamon, nutmeg and some floral pine resin too--with a hint of clove; a pleasure to breath in...PALATE: medium-bodied, creamy and lively--warming and substantial...TASTE: soft, rounded, almost nutty malted finish; buttery too; more subtle flavors of indistinguishable fruits than the aroma suggests, with the main influence on the taste buds being the malts... OVERALL: a solidly-built, easy-sipping ale that feels right on a windy, cold April night...."

"O - may I just say that I love dubbel's and I enjoy seeing an American brewery pull one off. Though this wasnt intended on slamming you with a massive Trappist inspired 8% dubbel. This is a creation of its own and one Smuttynose can be proud of. One we can sit down during the cold winter months and drink all night long with friends and family. Yes, a tasty treat during these brutally cold months but still allowing for a Cadillac of a brew. Easy going and flows perfectly. These were Smutty's intentions and I look forward to this for years to come."
""
"Smuttynose does a consistently GOOD job, again. Consistent. Love this brewer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"One of the best winter ales I've tried in a long time. Smooth mellow taste, very drinkable, no weird flavors like many winter ales these days. The only problem is it is disappearing fast along with the winter but this beer could work all year long. I hope they can repeat."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Taste is pleasant as well, and complex to boot. I get some fruity malts and yeasts that collide with cinnamon and nutmeg touches. This is an easy to enjoy ale that works perfectly on a wintry, snowy morning! Prost!"

"Pours a brown color with copper edges. The finger of head dissipated rather quickly and only left a trace of lace behind. The nose is distinctly malty. The flavor profile is rather malty with a slightly sweet finish. The mouthfeel is somewhat sticky. This offering is not quite full-bodied, but certainly not thin at all."
""
"If not for the metallic character, this would be superb. I will certainly need to give this a few more tries to see if it is just an off bottle."
""
""
""
""
"I think Smuttynose is right on target, using a Belgian Dubbel base recipe for its own Winter Warmer. The problem is that the Trappist Belgian monks got there first. The Smutty-version is denser, richer and heavier... a far departion from the drier, zestier and exuberant examples from those monasteries."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Quite flavorful and much easier to drink than a lot of others in the style considering the rather low ABV. Definitely an enjoyable brew and one I would definitely grab again. An interesting take on the winter beer with the introduction of the Belgian yeast (kind of a hybrid styled beer). Both the aroma and flavor of the beer increase in intensity + complexity as the beer warms up."
""
""
""
""
"O- I get some of the Belgian Dubbel connection, but I wouldn't go that far. Not too bad, mine may have been served too cold. The mineral feel holds it back."
""
"Notes: very good beer."
""
""
""
"My first review of a Smuttynose. Sort of a syrupy mouthfeel that was a little strange. Hoppy flavor with maybe some coffee notes. Nice amber color, full body. Some dark fruit and sugar aromas comes through on the nose. Nice beer to enjoy by a fire, good stuff."
""
""
""
""
"Wolf. This is nasty. Reminds me of state watered down Ommegang abbey dubbel. The flavors are there, dried fruit, caramel, toffee, but it was thin and bitter. It was a pour, I just couldn't drink it. I'm normally a Smutty fan, but I think they severely missed the mark on this one."
""
"I was hoping time to warm would help. It brings out more yeast character. Unfortunately, it also brings out diacetyl and vegetal notes, though the metallic character subsides. Just seems stale."
""
"O: This is one of the best winter beers I’ve tasted in quite a while. I’d be more than happy with a six-pack of this…and the more I think about it, the more I realize I could say that about any of the Smuttynose beers I’ve tried."
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a very dark brown color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of malts, some dark fruits, a bit bready. Taste is some hops up front, then malts, a touch of caramel, not as much fruit as the smell. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a pretty good beer."
""
"The feel holds a lot of dryness with a slight astringency. The carbonation is less than moderate as it has a thinness but it's not weak."
""
"The mouthfeel is medium/heavy bodied."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Not necessarily something I'd search out regularly but very solid overall, I'd definitely drink more"
"Smuttynose Winter Ale ---3.5/5"
""
"D - Not sure about the stye classification... I would consider this one a brown ale with some faint Belgian characteristics rather than a Dubbel... Regardless, it's an interesting and satisfying brew... Not world class by any means, but it's slightly different and interesting enough to impress me... A nice take on the winter seasonal..."

"Overall- Does what it's aming to do and I'd certainly buy it again; not something I'd pick up all the time, but as a Winter seasonal it's a solid offering."
""
""
""
"O- Okay, but nothing special. Smutty certainly does better beers."
""
""
"Creamy , warm, smooth with a suttle kick. Im thinking the ABV is a little over 6%. Went in for the OMB Dunkel , and after some prodding by the sales rep, i came out with the Smutty Winter. !st one straight from the bottle. Second one i poured , jus to get a better look, good aroma and nice red head. Really has body and hugs the glass. After #3 i had to rest my eyes"

"A good solid representation of the holiday/winter ale class, but not mind-blowing."
""
"this beer has a great brown color. the smell is malty with some wafts of caramel and vanilla. the taste is bitter and there is almost a blackened quality. there is a slight sweetness there but not much as the smell promises. i havnt had many beers from smutty nose, but this isnt bad at all and i may be inclined to buy some other of their beers."

"This beer doesn't seem to hit it's mark. For the most part the aroma and flavor try to survive on caramel malt alone with some esters trying to help out in the flavor. Unfortunately, a few off flavors creep in that detract from what this beer could have been. I'm glad I tried it once, but in my opinion there are better winter offerings and better Dubbels on the market."

"Overall decent, not great. I wouldn't call this remotely a dubbel, more like a winter brown, some interesting flavors,but a bit too syrupy and too much of the not so great hops."
""
""
""
"Overall – A nice blend of malt, sweet fruit and sugar tastes. It is a rather balanced winter style ale that is well worth a try."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A light yet very enjoyable session beer. Much less abv than most dubbels; yet, it has many classic features of that style, including the beautiful color and head, smooth yeasty smell and taste, and good balance. It might be a little light for some, but the taste is still appealing. It's easy to drink a couple of these or more. Very enjoyable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Descent winter ale. Complex and balanced."
"Lightly toasted malt up front. Tangy, sweetish fruit fills in. Tropical-y and banana-y. Caramelly, biscuity malt underneath. Yeasty finish is spicy with a hint of bitterish banana aftertaste. Medium bodied with a lively feel. Not bad, overall, but could use a little oomph to help bring a little more complexity and bring everything together better."
"What!? This is a Belgian dubbel!? Hey, a good winter warmer this would make, but a dubbel? No dice, grandma."
""
"It pours a slightly hazy, dark, brownish-red with a light tan head. the head fades slowly leaving a thin ring of foam with beautiful lacing that cascades down the side of the glass after holding for a few seconds. The smell is remeniscent of a glass of red wine. Grape with some plum, cocoa, vanilla, spices, roasty malts and finally hops. The aroma is terrifically complex. It has a rich, thick mouthfeel with medium carbonation. The taste starts off light and fruity, but turns into a hoppy, spicy, earthy brew for the finish. The malt comes through a lot more in the taste. It finishes semi-dry with some dark cocao and coffee notes, along with a sweet yeastiness to round it all out. Definately a home-run from the Smuttynose brewery."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a murky reddish brown with two fingers thick tan colored foam, settles slowly to a thin ring leaving a sheet of delicate lace for the first couple of inches. Smell: toasted wheat bread, red grape, caramel, floral and mildly earthy with a little black pepper. Taste: toast, caramel, peppery and midly earthy, plum skin, pear, unfiltered apple juice. Light bodied initially but very creamy feel, finishing dry and slightly sweet with some lingering tannic bitterness (peanut skin). Maybe not a standout, but I thought this was pretty solid. Best before 5/12/13."
""
""
""
"Cheers!"
"the color of this one is deep copper redish, pretty clear, with a few inches of finely laced tan foam. the nose is richly malty, complex, ranging from american amber to english caramel and beyond. there is a toffee sort of sweetness too, and more alcohol hanging around than the abv gives away. the flavor confirms that this is definitely a malt heavy beer, which is nice in this context without all the usual spice that typifies the style. like a christmas cookie or loaf of bread, rummy, tasty. the sweetness does not linger on in the finish, and it actually ends on a dry note. the flavors a good, but they all seem a little muted to me. not the depth of flavor i am used to in these often very robust beers. lots of body and an appropriate level of carbonation. not my favorite of the winter releases, but an easy drinking brew nevertheless."
""
""
"Pours dark reddish brown, thick retained head of white foam. Sticky. Strong dark fruity nose, some spices. Strong fruity taste. Somewhat of a masked hop at the close. Mellow malty flavor. Almost a red wine flavor too. Really flavorful. Nice spin on winter."
""
""
"Poured from a bottle into a tumbler pint, the beer is a vibrant, clear, hazelnut coloring with a sparse, filmy white coating on the surface. Aromas of roasty nut and biscuit in the backbone, with a solid spicing of nutmeg and cinnamon rounding out the sweet, rich flavors. Some fruity highlights in the back of the nose, also. Flavors of deep, dark, old world fruit, including prune and date, with an earthy undertone that keeps the richness in check. Spicing takes a backseat, but is present enough to perk the taste buds out of the sweetness shock by the end of the palate. Sweet and spicy blend on the aftertaste, which is fairly shortlived despite the robust initial flavors. The beer is smooth and round, but the spicing and carbonation does well to keep it light in mouth. Frothy, slightly sweet lingering finish. Very tasty."
"Like I said, I'd probably have this for the family if it was more widely available in my market. I can imagine this being a good holiday beer for ""average"" drinkers. I like it well enough either way."
"This beer's worth drinking several times over the holidays."
"Overall- Doesnt seem really winter like, but I enjoy the unique flavors. The flavor and smell on this beer might have been the most difficult for me to ID, but it is very tasty!"
""
""
"O-I don't like this. it doesn't taste like a good dubbel. it's an odd dubbel, even for an American brewery. I expect more from Smutty. it almost tastes adjunct to me."
""
""
"Overall: This is definitely one of my favorite Christmas winter warmer seasonals I’ve had to date…outstanding flavor, mixed it just right and I have to say, I like the darker malts used here…nothing is overdone and everyone seems to know their roles…the nose could awaken a bit more and if it were a little heavier, this would be an unbeatable brew…as it is, it’s highly recommended for your next Christmas party and with it’s relatively low ABV, I certainly could drink this all night and be merry (and competent)…(4/5)"
""
""
""
"O- Decent. Would have again but wouldn't seek out."
""
""
""
"O - a pleasant brew."
""
"O: A nice American-style dubbel with a nice Belgian flair. Nothing outstanding about this, but it is a nice winter beer. It is also readily available through the colder months, so that helps as well"
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Not a bad beer AT ALL! I enjoyed this beer....as I do most (it is beer...duh!) and I'm ready for another. Very easy to drink albeit one dimensional, but I won't hold that against it. I did expect more for a winter brew but was not disappointed. Nice ABV for the price ($9.99 for six here in Maryland). BEER!!"
""
""
"Not a typical ""Winter"" ale. I suppose it is more a ""Dubbel," as noted in the description on this page. It is very nice for a cold winter night, but not one I would consider for the winter beer hall of fame."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a good beer that is warming, tasty, but not something I could drink more than one of a night. Good winter beer."
""
""
""
""
"Overall this is a decent representation of style but really is fairly one noted. It is definitely not your prototypical winter seasonal or Dubbel for that matter but I have definitely had worse. Kind of tastes like an American Amber fermented with a Belgian yeast. Decent but I'll stick to something else during the winter months."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - For the price, the convenience, and the ABV, this is a great Dubbel. It doesn’t look as good as real Trappist Dubbels or have the great aroma and taste nuances of Belgian yeast, but you really can’t go wrong with this one. Very tasty and drinkable beer."
""
""
"O- A rather tasty American version of a Dubbel. Worth a try if you haven't had it before. Recommended. Cheers."
""
"O - Overall this is a fine brew that I relish for the price I got them at. Not the best Dubbel by a long stretch, but I do not think I would be disappointed if a friend offered me one, particularly on a nice winter afternoon."
""
""
"O - Overall a good, drinkable beer. Nice for winter. A drinkable, available, and flavorful beer that would satisfy anyone on a cold night."

"Single bottle from my fridge. Poured into a stemmed beer glass. Light leather brown color. Slight head, but that faded quickly. Not much lacing, which was surprising. Smell had a nice aroma of dark fruit and raisins. Taste was a combination of caramel, fig, and brown sugar. Very light though; would have liked a more upfront flavor. And the mouthfeel was on the thin side. This is a nice winter ale brewed like a dubbel. A solid local winter offering."
""
""
""
""
"Overall / Drinkability: Nice beer - not a lot going on in the aroma department but good appearance and taste. Interesting combination of flavors and not quite like any Dubbel I've had before, but I will say it works as a winter beer - warming and enjoyable even though the alcohol is just a hair above 5%. Glad I picked one up on sale but not sure if I would buy a six pack of it. That being said, if another one was available I would probably have it again, so good drinkability."
"O - I enjoyed this beer. It has a nice Belgian yeast/dark fruit character that is balanced nicely with the roasted malt and spices. Very drinkable brew."
"O- Very good all around. A nice winter beer with good balance between the malts and flavors, light hopping that is barely noticeable but must be present to balance things out."
""
"O- Not too high in alcohol for a dubbel, but that's OK. It's great if you just want a dark Belgian that's easy to drink."
""
"I've passed this over for years thinking it was a spiced winter ale, well today I fixed that and bought a bottle. Pours a deep clear shade of orange garnet with a bubbly beige head that displays remarkable retention but spotty lace. Smells of spice, pepper, and caramel with hints of dark dried fruits. Sweet sugary flavor is highlighted by caramel and sweet reduced fruit syrup. Hints of spice, and Belgian esters, but not to much for my palette. Medium body with a light to moderate level of carbonation and a sweet creamy mouthfeel. Decent brew, surely not the best dubbel in the world, but very respectable. Time to check out some more brews I've been avoiding."
""
"I am upgrading my rating of the beer to 4.0 overall."
""
"Pours a hazy orange-ish to brown color with a tan head. In the aroma, vanilla, oaky(?), and a nice spice blend. In the taste, vanilla, cinnamon, oaky, and almost creamy. A small spice bite and a medium bodied mouthfeel, with a dry cinnamon and almost bourbon like aftertaste. Almost feels bourbon barreled, quite nice."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: nice fest style winter warmer. No spiciness, smooth, malty like a typical brown ale. Nice."
""
""
""
""
"O: good dubbel for me, but unsure how true ""dubbel"" fans feel about this ... hmmm?"
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. Did not realize this was a dubbel until I saw it on BA- doesn't taste like it. Not particularly active head but it is visibly effervescent. What little head exists is off-white. There is very minimal retention and only a few spots of lacing. Pours a dark brown color almost like cola (opaque but can see light through the edges). Smells of ginger and dark malt. Taste is not overly convincing- weak dark malt flavor almost like a dunkel and a hint of the ginger. The mouthfeel was the most disappointing part to me- watery, weakly carbonated; not the kind of things I want in a beer. Overall this is an OK session beer- definitely not one I would buy again."
""
""
"O: Overall, this is a pretty tasty beer and is very drinkable. I've been looking for a good winter ale all season, and this one didn't disappoint. Though there's nothing particulary memorable about this brew, I would definitely drink it again, no doubt."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is a perfect beer to be drunk sitting by a warm fire, or on a leather chair watching the night snow fall outside, warm, cozy and everything being just quite right. Malt character is the name of the game here, not as balanced or adequately hopped as I would have liked, but it will do nicely."
""
""
"Overall not a bad beer, just lacking in complexity when judged against other dubbels. Would drink again, just wouldn't go out of my way to get it."
"Very good, and I am glad to have grabbed a sixer of it for the week."
"Sometimes a beer has kind of a vomit taste. Not full on vomit, just kind of. This was one of those times. It was from an hours-old growler. I've had a couple of other beers with that prominent flavor note, and once it was with a beer that did not normally have a vomit taste. Is it me? Or is it some particular thing that has gone wrong with the batch? I don't know. But with so many yet to try, I don't want to try this one again to find out."
"Color is a transparent brown with shades of maroon. The dense off-white head id dense and long lasting. Smells like bread, with a hint of citrus. The taste is sweet and roasty malts, followed by pine and citrus hops flavors. Nicely balanced and complex, quite flavorful. Nice mouthfeel too. Solid beer all around."
""
""
"Overall - I was pretty impressed. A fairly solid, wintery dubbel. Another good beer by Smuttynose."
""
""
""
""
"O: Just above average Dubbel."
""
"Overall this is an enjoyable beer. Very well suited to the winter months."
""
""
""
"Overall - Not what I was expecting, but still pleasantly drinkable. There is some nice fruit flavour mixed with a good amount of malts. Not something I'd be on the look out for next winter, but still solid."
"Drink- I would have said this was a standard, if not tasty, winter ale if I hadn't read that it had belgian ale yeast in it. Complex enough to satisfy you craving for a hearty ale. Fairly drinkable, but I would switch to even warmer winter stouts after one of these."
"O-another nice seasonal from smutty, a nice switch from over spiced/over boozed seasonals"
""
""
"M-O- A little thick and very smooth. This is a bit light as doubles all the way around, but a very good beer. A winter beer that not to spiced up and/or boozed is a nice switch."
""
""
"O: I didn't expect a winter ale to be a dubbel, but i guess it does fit for the winter time. it is good, and very low in alcohol but too complex for high drinkability, in my opinion. definitely a recommended beer!"
"Ps. ... waft."
""
""
""
""
"Kind of schizophrenic beer here, with a nose like a lackluster American-made dubbel, but flavor like a good porter or straight winter warmer. I was getting ready to slam this, but it came around, & I'm glad."
""
"It pours a seasonally-colored ruddy amber red. It has an aroma of cloves backed by some malty sweetness. Taste is layered, complex, lingering and rewarding. There’s cloves and nutmeg, some allspice, and a long finish that coats the mouth with each subsequent sip. Hard to believe it’s a dubbel only because I like it so much—no “bubblegum” flavors makes it really enjoyable. This is exactly how I want my winter ales to taste!"
""
"What is this? And is that style, a ""dubbel"" marked properly? I might've accepted this as a crappy winter warmer but a dubbel? No, severely dissapointing"
""
"This is very nicely dark colored ale. Aroma has a light chocolate roastiness.Taste is a fine malted toffee, chocolate ale.Overall this is very nice, but make sure it has been refridgerated for a while.Otherwise the malt taste will be more like your drinking a robust tootsy roll.It does get better.I'd be happy to drink more.Glad I gave it a chance."
""
"The scent of this beer was very sweet malt that included characteristics of belgian ale yeast. The taste was pretty mild and had great malt character. The mouthfeel was a good medium body with decent carbonation. I highly recommend this winter sensation."
"Bottle poured a clear reddish brown withg a small lasting creamy tan head. Aromas of toffee, cocoa,light earthiness and a hint of spice. Palate was medium bodied and crisp with a smooth finish. Flavors of toffee, cocoa, light carmel, light earthiness and a hint of spice with a smoothlingering malty finish."
""
""
""
"It's a bit too drinkable for the style, and not fruity enough, but it is very good, and a great value. I am going to seek out a bunch more to have around the house for the holidays. It is easy to drink and tasty."
""
""
""
""
"Nice brew. Served with a thick, light tan, foamy, frothy, expansive head that settled after a bit and plenty of lace. Color is a clear dark red amber. Aroma is malt, fruit, roast, toffee. Flavor is like nose plus more emphasis and carbonic tang, yeast. Body & carbonation are good. Finish is like flavor, of shorter duration, and pleasant. Very easy drinking beer. Easy enough to have another, which I will do."
""
"-JH-"
""
""
"A good beer worthy of more, but nothing special."
""
"Smooth and rich, perfect for a winter night."
""
""
""
"o - Overall a very easy to drink dubbel. Lots of bananas, bread/wheat, and cloves. Would definitely order this one again."
"O: Very tasty. Seasonally appropriate."
"I would welcome a semi-Imperial version of this brew. Maybe something in the 6-6.5% range. Just a thought..."
"Taste is pretty good. It is actually a little nutty and satiny smooth. Some hops present at the end. Mostly a light malt flavor prevails."
""
"Very drinkable - a steady beer when I tire of SN Celebration & Berkshire Cabin Fever."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: very drinkable beer, abv is low but flavors are also kind of subdued and don't really 'wow' at all. I was kind of disappointed in the flavor after the pleasant smell."
"Overall, an interesting beer but not really a traditional Dubbel. It is an American Dubbel, if there is such a style."
"There's a bit of a graham cracker taste underneath that mixes well with the malt. It's very crisp and basically smooth, with a mild carbonation to it. There's something a bit off, that detracts just slightly. I can't put my finger on it. But it's a bit stale. Yet, it's flavorful and worth a go."
"O: Very nice to drink! I like the sweet flavor, which is delicately balanced by a bit of bitterness from the hops. AT just 5.1%, I could easily see myself enjoying a few of these on a cold winter night by the fire. Only downside is, I was expecting a bit more spice character. Nevertheless, pick it up if you get the chance!"
"O: some nice things going on here, doesn't quite achieve the authentic Belgian dubbel flavor, a little lacking in the balance department."
""
""
"Overall, the smell is wack but the taste is great. A hardy brew for winter months."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Not bad. I feel that overall flavor and aroma are light. Nothing really stands out. This beer would best be suited as a winter session ale."
"O/D-Pretty good in terms of a Winter seasonal. Would I ever buy a six pack of this beer before a six pack of SN Celebration Ale? NO. But this is a nice buy if you're looking for a smooth, interesting dark seasonal beer to experiment with. Decent price for a six. Love the artwork on the bottle too."
"O - This is a very good winter beer. Nice flavor, while still having some subtle undertones of fruit. Good to warm up on a cool winter night."
"D/O- Yeah, I know it's after the ""Best Before"" date...I took a chance on a single and I don't think it turned out that badly. Didn't know what style or ABV this was when I bought it...hoping for an 8% winter warmer but this didn't disappoint."
"Randomly picked this up last week, engaged by the semi-kitsch label. It pours a clear ruby-garnet topped by a short finger of light tan foam. The nose comprises red grapes, dusty toffee, rye bread, figs, clove, honey, very light orange peel, a touch booze, and a few drops of coffee. The taste holds notes of rye bread, light cocoa, light mint, toffee, brown sugar, clove, black pepper, figs, and a bit of red wine. The body is a meek medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a smooth feel. Overall, a very nice brew, one I'm going to look for during it's appropriate season."
"O: Eh. Maybe a fresher bottle would be better? Maybe not. The flavors were richer than they needed to be, and you'd think that time would actually mellow this."
"This brew poured out as a nice looking brown color. The head was very big and had a generous amount of lacing. The smell was a little spicy but nothing over the top. The other aroms were a little on the earthy side. The taste was a little like the smell spicey and earthy, not really picking up much blegian yeast though. The mouthfeel was pretty nice, it was medium bodied, it could have probably been a little thicker. overall This beer wasn't too bad. I wouldn't have guessed it was an Abbey Dubbel if I had been blindfolded."
"Props to Smutty and founder Peter Egelston, who responded right away to an e-mail of mine asking about this beer being called ""Smuttynose Double"" at the bar where I enjoyed it. Cheers!"
"This beer is a bit on the lighter side of winter ales I have had but I tend to think a lot of the winter ales I have had tend to be a bit overspiced so this beer I enjoyed. The beer is a little bit much for a session beer but I can see myself having a few of these in one sitting."
"Overall this is a good beer. Worthy of spreading to other folks who may or may not be familiar with the style. Would be a great party beer to bring and have others enjoy."
"The flavor is more complex than expected for how light the mouthfeel is. Some earthy prune/grapes underneath a biscuit/toasted chocolate base. A dry finish with not that much hop character. Just a dryness that doesn't cloy and with a lighter body a drinkable beer."
"This is a good beer but not really in the conversation of solid dubbels. Nice winter brown though."
"D - Very drinkable. The flavor are nicely balanced and the spices do not get out of control. Overall a really nice winter beer that is more than just spices. Could have used a touch more body."
"Overall this one kinda confusues me. A bit light for a dubbel I have to admit but it was still a really well done beer. Needs a little bit more to make it excellent but this is really nice none the less."
"Not sure if this is a dubbel or not, as it does not claim to be one on the label and I never had a dubbel before,but regardless a very good and tasty yet sessionable brew."
"A lovely winter session ale that I could drink all night. Well balanced, it really warms the soul."
"This is NOT a Dubbel by the way!!!"
"This is a real interesting take on this style, the low abv makes it real enjoyable and super easy to drink. This feels like a Christmas winter beer for sure, it hints of Black Forest German Chocolate cake with the artificial cherry on top. Great beer."
"Pours a dark cloudy brown with a hint of red color. Has a very small amount of brownish white head that dissipates very quickly. Leave little to no lacing on the glass. The smell has toasted malts with a sweet brown sugar tones as well. Taste goes with the smell and has a good amount of spice to it. Has medium carbonation and creamy feel to the texture. Pretty drinkable and a good winter ale."
"Smuttynose Winter Ale is brown in colour and has a nice 5 mm head than fades into a little bit of lacing in a minute or so. The smell is malty with some toffee. The initial taste was quite mild, but quickly develops into malt and roastiness. The aftertaste is roasty with some yeast flavour. This beer is really creamy and goes down very easily."
"D: Robustly malty, fruity & smooth. Very approachable and almost dangerously quaffable. Almost dessert like in the flavor profile, but with out being heavy or even particularly rich. Balanced, hearty, yet refined - more emphasis on malty & fruity with a rounded sweetness and a rather restrained Belgian character (more Belgian amber than an actual dubbel)."
"drinkable - sure, yeah,"
"Poured a medium brown with a large light brown rocky head that was mostly diminishig and had excellent lacing. The aroma was of toasted bread malts, a horse blanket yeast and a mild resin hop with notes of dried fruit and bananas. It tasted sweet and mild with notes of dried fruit and was qiute malty from start to finish. Mouthfeel was medium in body and watery in texture with lively carbonation. Overall a very nice drinkable brew."
"Not your typical winter beer. A nice take on the part of Smuttynose."
"M: Full bodied, higher carbonation."
"The beer pours a dark brown. Has a rich, sweet smell. Almost getting a little chocolate here. The taste pretty much follows the nose, with a malty, sweet taste. I love Smuttynose. Here's another good one from them, and a nice example of a winter beer."
"This is a good little issue from Smutty. What you'd expect in a winter lager but not your prototypical winter. Dark color, good nose, and a definite palate-pleaser in taste BUT much crisper than your average winter. After finishing the first one I thought ""This is a nice little beer."" A pleasant surprise. Unmistakingly a winter but with a nice Smutty twist. If you're looking for something heavy or powerful, you'll want to pass on this one. If you want a highly drinkable winter this is an excellent choice."
"DB- A nice winter beer, probably one of my favorites that I have had in this season (besides the stouts). Really has a flavorful Belgian profile to it and doesn't just pile on the spices and dark fruit."
"However, I won't hold it against her. Things were different in the 1950's. They hadn't discovered cynicism yet."
"As far as winter ales and lagers go, this is a nice find because it's not quite as heavy (both ABV and taste) as most others. A nice change of pace for a winter beer while still keeping many of the rich characteristics we like so much with winter ales."
"Still, I would give it a try. Its a nice beer to drink when snowed in."
"12oz bottle poured into dimple mug. Pours a dark cloudy amber with some lighter golden amber hues when held to a light source and a one finger beige head that settles into a lasting ring. Minimal lacing. Malty aroma with some peppery spice and dark fruit notes especially dark cherries. Spicy peppery flavor up front that lingers over the medium malty body into a medicinal cough syrup flavor with some dark fruit notes, mostly cherries, raisin and plum. Nice subtle dry hops in the finish. One of my favorite winter brews."
"Dark reddish brown with a nice tan head. Smells super malty with big notes of brown sugar and dates, and now and then a waft of wet grain. Tastes sweet and rich like dark fruit, which for some reason makes it seem more boozy than it is. There's also some smokiness and an eventual bittering hop presence on the back of the tongue. That hop presence is very minimal though. This beer is a malt machine. It seems like some kind of Scottish dopplebock hybrid (Scotchbock?), but it's classified as a dubbel here. Interesting. Whatever it is, it's another good brew from Smutty. Keep em coming."
"D - A quite enjoyable winter warmer. Could well enjoy sipping 2-3 of these in a sitting."
"D: OK beer, nothing too exciting, but I would definitely consider this beer again."
"D- a nice winter ale that is nice on a cold winter day. It goes down fairly smooth and could see myself drinking a sixer in a day."
"D - As far as winter warmers go this beer is a pretty nice tick. Easy drinking and not to much spice, yet not really needing it I could have a couple a sitting. Very good guys!"
"Solid brew, didn't care much for the aroma but the flavor makes up for it."
"Pours a dark brown with some orange / amber hues, 1 finger of tan head that doesn't hang around long. Lots of malt sweets in the nose, maybe some spices too that I cant place. Picking up lots of flavors - roasted nuts, caramel, toffee, apples, black cherry, cinnamon, even some dark chocolate...seems to all balance out well. Medium bodied and adequate carbonation - not a style I really care to drink more than one of in a sitting, but the lower ABV certainly makes this Dubbel fairly drinkable (though maybe not exactly a Dubbel)."
"A unique winter warmer, lacks warming punch, but plenty of festive flavors."
"Slightly warming, slightly dry. Medium body and effervescence. Pretty good as a brown ale but nothing really makes it special for winter. There should be more body or some spices or something, anything to make it stand out."
"Overall, I'd say this needs work. The ingredients to not marry well together, and it is too hoppy for the style. Perhaps some age with the yeast and hops to mellow would do it some good..."
"I don't think I would have picked this out as being a dubbel, but it is a good beer nevertheless"
"The mouthfeel is a little heavy, but good for the style. Carbonation is moderate. Drinkability is decent, the yeast spice and the malty sweetness worked pretty well as a Christmas seasonal. It wasn't the best Dubbel, but it was a pretty good holiday seasonal in relation to all the other spice bombs. Pretty enjoyable beer overall."
"Easy drinking enough, and a welcome respite from the abundance of spiced beers offered for this time of year."
"D- Mouthfeel makes me think of winter and it's a great seasonal"
"D: This is a good winter ale from Smuttynose. For me, it wasn't the best interpretation of a Dubbell. The belgain yeast seems to get lost. But a solid offering, nonetheless."
"D: One of these is good for me, but not a hard beer to get down."
"Dr. yessiree, it's very drinkable."
"I was on a winter beer bent this year and this was one of the nicer ones that I tried."
"D: Good, not great. Easy drinking winter beer here."
"Overall, a C+."
"D- Very easy to drink. A nice simple, clean, and uncomplicated but sophisticated beer. A great example to introduce unititiated folks to craft beer."
"Overall I'm on the fence, but right now I'm liking this more than I did at the start of this review. After trying this single, I think a 6 could be in my future. A nice beer."
"Notes: Nothing to rave about or to seek out in and of itself. But it is unremarkably pleasing."
"Lower ABV than a typical dubbel, but then again Smuttynose doesn't consider this to be a true dubbel. Still, there is a solid medium-body mouthfeel that, combined with dark appearance and yeasty spice flavors, gives it a bit of a warming feel perfect for the season."
"D-Very drinkable a great winter beer."
"D: What a delicious beer and quite similar to Sweetwater Festive Ale."
"D: This was not the best tasting beer, but it had great body and was easy to drink. The hint of vanilla was nice, but it was overpowered by the metallic taste. That left the beer drinkable but not recommended. I would also have never guessed the style as a dubbel. Seemed more like an standard brown ale, to me."
"D- i don't think i've ever had a 5% dubbel before, but i'm not disappointed with this one. it has some of that belgian flavor and some of that american flavor and a little bit of something mid-atlantic. this one ain't a sipper, and i'm tiltin my tulip up like a champ. definitely worth a try and very unique among the winter ales available to me."
"D: Nice apperance and mouthfeel but where is the smell/taste with this one....very bland beer."
"This is a beer with an above average body and medium carbonation. It has a touch of stickiness, but doesn't leave a large coat behind. In fact, I find that it goes down pretty easily. I look forward to this beer every winter."
"Overall- I like this beer and would happily drink it again. However, I think it's just too mellow and reserved to get high marks especially when compared to its cousins in Belgium"
"The mouth is light and is a very drinkable dubble but this also i think degrades its overall quality taste"
"D - Has a bigger feel then it's ABV would indicate. A sessionable winter ale/dubbel/english brown. I'd spend a cold night with a few of these."
"Drinkability is really damn good. I'm surprised by how big the gulps I'm taking are (slow down big fella...) and that's a testament to it's taste and feel. You'd be doing good if you give this one a go."
"Pours a nice deep reddish brown with a just off white head withbtiny bubbles. Really pretty. After looking at the style, I saw this was a double and I have to judge on it. Aroma was astringent and really soapy. Had a mild molasses and orange peel tinge. The flavor is clean, fresh and crisp, really perfect winter taste. Nice orange peel, plum, raisins and a little cola taste. The mouthfeel is spot on. Moderate carbonation and really great cleansing at the finish. Drinkability is really great. Nice low abv let's me have a few of these."
"On the border of being a little too sweet, but a little spiciness and alcohol save it."
"4.0 D: A pretty good beer and probably the most sessionable ""dubbel"" I've come across, but need a bit of a boost in the flavor department. Would drink again."
"Basically, this is one of my favorite winter ales so far. Not at all something that will give you some awe inspiring session or blow your beer world away. But...sitting down, after a long days work, on a cold december night, this beer hits the spot. Just what I want to be drinking right now!"
"I'll take another, but there are winter-specific beers I'd pick up first."
"Drinkability -- I really liked this beer. A lot. However, it's not really much of a Dubbel. The Belgian yeast is somewhat detectable, but it drinks more like a Scottish Ale with the toasted and caramelized malt flavors. Had it been called a Scottish Ale, or even a Winter Warmer I would've been glad to give this better scores. Still, it's a tasty beer that I would recommend highly."
"D: This is a low ABV Dubbel. Not overly complex but certainly enjoyable."
"Overall this beer just didn't have much of an identity, it just was. Not a terrible beer by any stretch but not worth seeking out."
"In the mouth is a Sting of spice up front followed by a nutty fullness (meaty) finnishing with bitter citrus and molasses = very nice. A very warming winter brew."
"Smuttynose Winter Ale pours a rich brown in color. Very malty, sweet and cake-ish. Just a hint of hops overall bready and doughy. Full bodied and robust, a little heavy for a winter warmer (not a dubbel at all) but still quite nice. Refreshing that this offering isn't an over-spiced holiday ale, in fact this was rather refreshing and easy to drink."
"This is one of this season's very best offerings."
"D: The beer doesn't lack decent flavors, it just seems an elementary stab at a winter ale. Thin and over carbonated for a dubbel."
"Pours a dark cherry/mahogany color with a nice frothy head that retains well. Nice lacing. Smells of sweet malts, earthy hops. Tastes of candied malts, caramel, dark fruit, cherries, and a light earthy hop spice to finish. Slick, wet mouthfeel. Pretty good."
"Slightly watery mouthfeel."
"Overall, not too bad. A rather middle-of-the-road offering from a pretty decent brewery."
"Notes: Not sure of the freshness on this one, I get a little oxidation. Not my favorite smuttynose"
"Drinkability - This one is drinkable all the way through the coldest of winter nights, even more so with the ABV this year at only 5.2%. I thought it was higher, more around 7...I'll have to check the packaging again. This one goes down nice and smooth. A great beer when you don't want much of a hop bite, but do enjoy some complex flavors that aren't up in your face."
"pretty decent drinkability, but there are far better winter style ales to session out there. not much of a belgian dubbel. a nice try non the less. id love to have this side by side with this years upcoming smutty winter ale."
"D: Given its low alcohol content, the beer is very drinkable yet it still manages to pack in a lot of flavor."
"M/D - light-medium bodied winter beer with some decent flavor but nothing too over the top."
"Pours a pretty dark brown color with little head on the top. Scents of orange peel and brown sugar shine through. Tastes, however, a bit heavier than the scent. Almost oft-chocolatey taste with a bit of orange. Very pleasant. Easy to drink! Not really overly heavy. Seems like it can be a good summer quaff. Nice offering."
"D - This isn't really what I expect in a winter ale, but it's a nice beer that's easy to drink."
"The taste is robust but still a little light for a double. Flavors are tea, a sour taste with phenols included, graham and maybe a bit of cinnamon. Overall this is just decent, not bad but the mouth feel is much too watery and I have no idea what they were going for with taste. This may be a little on the old side of things, but at 8.99 for 12 it was hard not to try it."
"WTF, is a 4.5% beer now a dubbel, somebody change that rediculous label on this brew. Best by June 2010 yeah fuckin' right, I had this during Christmas on tap at Sharp Edge in Washington County the Brasserie. Low abv beers are meant to move quick brewed in october or november this is dead by march or april I don't care what Trappist yeast you use. Pours a deep clouded amber mahogany brown hue with a light beige khaki head, nice head retention again another gusher as I cracked it open, WTF? Aroma has a creamy nut and fruit combo let's go with crushed almonds and raisins cooked in a cookie dough maybe an Italiano biscotti. Flavor has a creamy sweetness going on okay I will swallow my words it is a dubbel light slight tart apple raisin combo with a nutty yeast flavor going on it's really a nice session ale a bit of a dryness in finish more power to 'em I didn't enjoy the draft as much. Maybe a 4.5% brew was too young with the yeast in the bottle this brew is drinking nice, I bough this for 2 bucks a bottle. Mouthfeel is medium bodied dry finish on the palate carbonation is even during the drinking experience but was pretty much a volcanic explosion on the opening of the cap."
"M/D: Full and starchy, like an oatmeal stout. I expect a winter ale to have more punch (ABV)."
"Drinkability: A good dubbel that I could have two or three of. I do like the breadiness of it. I would get this again."
"Smuttynose Winter Ale is a hazy, tawny brown ale with a thin, khaki head that leaves decent lacing on the glass. It has a big, malty aroma with a soft sweetness and light notes of grass and spice. It has a smooth, medium body that's lively with a crisp, clean finish. It has a smooth, malty flavor with a slight caramel sweetness. The grassy, herbal bitterness is light and doesn't distract. Spice comes late in the taste... like nutmeg and corriander. It tastes leathery; slightly phenolic. It's pretty complex but it's mellow. Yeah, it's incredibly drinkable-- it could serve as a session ale."
"Overall quite nice, but perhaps a little too malt-forward and a touch cloying. The low 4.8% ABV really should take this out of the Dubbel category, but it really does fall into it in most aspects, and the mild level of alcohol really puts this into a decent position for drinkability."
"a great intro to the winter category but not the best winter out there"
"This beer pours a dark amber, with only a finger or two of off white lacing that quickly disappears leaving only a little lacing. I smell some malty scents, and a few other faint scents, but not much. For this style, I might consider this on the more carbonated side. The main flavors I notice are, again, the caramel malts, and a very little bit of fruit flavors, maybe apple, and a touch of hoppy bitterness at the end. This beer isn't too filling, and its taste is solid if not exceptional, so I think it could definitely be a session beer."
"Drinkability- Thanks to the lighter flavors and body, it makes it very easy to drink. Also the unusually low ABV does not hurt. Not oftern you see a Winter seasonal with that low ABV."
"I have had this beer before I started rating, and my memory was that this was a better beer than it actually is I guess. Interesting."
"Not high in alcohol, and very refreshing."
"D- A decent brew that doesn't quite compare with others popular brews of the same style."
"D- Really easy to drink and I think the name on this one had me fooled. Not at all what I expected."
"Enjoyable though not exceptional beer. A session winter ale?"
"The hop overpowered what seem a nicely complex beer for me."
"D: This beer is very easy to drink, and a nice departure from the typical styles of winter brews."
"F.T.- Even though they label says this a winter ale; I could also enjoy this anytime with pasta, lamb, or beef, almost like a Shiraz Wine."
"Notes: This is classified as a Dubbel? Tastes more like a brown ale to me."
"Drinkability: Though the Trappist ale yeast character never really jumped out at me, I still found it to be a pleasant blending of styles, making for a pretty tasty beer. I've had a couple doses of SWA (people quickly recognize the beer acronyms BCS and KBS, so let's get SWA started) now, but I may head out to get another helping before the impending close of the winter season."
"I was surprised to see a winter ale at that low an alcohol by volume but pleased because it is winter and it was early in the day. So, perfect. It was as good as I had hoped and now knowing it's a dubbel makes a lot of sense. Good beer with good color, taste and mouthfeel."
"On the other hand, winter beers in general want to take your mind off the cold, and give you some robust flavors and a bit of alcoholic warmth to occupy your senses. And this beer does that indeed."
"Pours with a credible amount of head and rich, reddish brown color. The initial smell is a fruity/malty combination that belies the taste to come. The taste is much fuller than one would expect from such a beer and has hints of caramel and fruits with a spiciness in the after taste that is tough to pin down. There is a lingering taste of roasted nuttiness as well. A bit chewy but goes down relatively smooth. A great interpretation from Smuttynose"
" Highly quaffable dubbel. Thanks 4sburgh and the empire beer club."
"I find this beer much more complex and enjoyable than their IPA. Not the best Dubbel around, but still a decent offering from Smuttynose. Worth a shot."
"Would I buy more of it? - probably as part of a mixed pack but no need to buy a whole six-pack. Decent stuff but there are too many other beers out there."
"Pretty easy to drink on a cold night. Would be easy to down a couple of these."
"D: I'm struck by one word for this beer: pleasant. While not a world-class dubbel, this is a well-brewed, appealing winter brew with very nice balance. I wasn't especially impressed with Smuttynoses's Star Island Single, but their dubbel is a beter effort to be sure."
"Tried this beer upon a whim, as I usually drink IPA's, saw this brew in the front of the store, and decided, ""What the hey"". and gave it a shot. Drank this straight from the bottle, so I cannot comment on the appearance, but the smell is reminiscent of raisins, bread, malt and some spices, perhaps cinnamon, but very faintly. Goes down smooth, and has no unpleasant aftertaste to it whatsoever. An overall satisfying session beer, will definitely try this one again, gave me a nice brief break from my IPA's."
"D: I like that this dubbel won't put me to sleep. A nice beer for tonight."
"The low ABV makes this a truly sessionable winter warmer, but weighed against style, this is another domestic bastardization of a Trappist classic."
"D - Drinkable, but not preferable in particular."
"D: Good winter ale, no crazy spices, and with the low ABV it's super drinkable. I think it being classified as a dubbel may be a bit off."
"D- This is a good, classic example of a winter/ Christmas beer. Its certainly spiced but not cloyingly so. Worth a try"
"Smuttynose may not be a high ABV winter warmer but it is a warming and comforting beer nonetheless. It's like an old flannel shirt or your favorite chair throw. I often lament that we do not get as many seasonals as we should so I am glad I picked up this from Smuttynose!"
"Poured into a shaker pint. Nice dark amber color with little head that rapidly disappears and no lacing. Nice light spicy aroma. Great sweet and spicy flavor but in no means is it overbearing. Dark fruit flavors (plum?)nutmeg and clove in it. Slight sour finish. This was a very wonderful surprise."
"D - This is a pretty drinkable beer. Not my favorite, but I wouldn't turn one down. Certainly worth a try."
"Pours a dark murky copperish brown with a small off white head that recedes quickly. Smell is spicy and fruity malt with a bit of a yeast note. Nice malty flavor with some fruit and spicy complexity. Toasty and caramel. Some herbal hops also. Nice underlying sweetness. Pretty balanced and tasty. Medium bodied and smooth. Very easily drinkable. A solid winter beer."
"D - the drinkability is pretty good w/ flavor that is clean and pretty easy to quaff- the flavors of the malts are in focus and satisfies well, but doesn't prompt me to order more than a couple to be honest"
"Fairly easy to drink. Decent beer and nice for the price."
"Comes out of the bottle a clear, warm, dark coppery brown with a fairly thick cream-white head. Aroma is strong and malty with a fruity undertone and a hint of spice. Malty flavor has a spicy undertone and a hint of fruit, mainly apple. Texture is fairly smooth with a nice tingle to it. Not Smuttynose's best, but worth a try anyway."
"At the end of a long blustery weekend, it was a pleasure to drink; however, Smuttynose Winter Ale also would be good at the end of a hot summer day. It's an enjoyable easy-drinking ale, but not a special winter ale."
"These could go down quick. Nice Christmas beer, although I'm not sure why anyone would call it a Christmas beer other than the label. But hey, it's more Christmas than Bell's Oberon."
"Overall an OK Winter-style beer. Not my favorite but very drinkable!"
"D - Quite drinkable and well balanced, this has an impressive amount of flavor considering its modest alcohol content. Its flavors heavily favor sugars and malt but do well in those departments with a complex amber profile. The hops stick to the background, but do contribute enough to the finish to keep the beer balanced. The yeast complexity is a bit weak, and if it were actually a dubbel this would hurt the beer, but it is sufficient to identify this as a Belgian style beer. Overall, this is quite enjoyable and a nice choice of style for a seasonal winter beer."
"D = THis is a realy good drinkable little beer on a cold Winter's day."
"Drinkability: By the books mild dubbel. Nothing impressive, but nothing horrible either. Satisfying brew, but much more could be done for this beer to actually stand out,"
"Drinkability: It goes down light and smooth. Nothing about it is offensive, but it doesn't stand out from the crowd at all, which is remarkable for Smuttynose, which is usually one of my favorites. I'd drink it if I were in beer purgatory, but I can't think of a situation where I'd be able to find this but nothing better was available."
"D- Christmas beers, while fun & seasonal are not always my cup of tea. This beer does not strike me as a typical x-mas beer, nor a typical dubbel...but this is a tasty an interesting beer from Smutty. I would recommend this beer."
"A very drinkable double, but lacking in flavor. Has roasty and nutty characteristics atypical of the style. slightly on the watery side. its not anything mind blowing but it is unique and not as cloying as dubbels can tend to be. a good solid brew, but nothing to write home about."
"Gets close to two fingers of dark tan microfoam, dimples slightly as it dissipates swiftly, touch of lacing left behind. Some cloudiness to the orange-brown liquid, metallic sort of look, lightens a good bit at the rims. Nutmeg, clove and cola, pinch of dark chocolate, white raisin, apple, pear fruit scents, overall the nose has many elements yet remains demure, if not reticent, ends with suggestions of chocolate-filled croissants as well as peat moss. Medium-bodied, the carbonation contributes lift and steadier pacing, right-sized to the whole. The flavors lean towards the sweet side but the beer remains pretty dry. Green apple, white grape, pear and apricot predominate, light glimmer of orange peel. Cocoa powder, malts, cinnamon and clove spice work well to create an affable first half even as hoppier grassiness and pepperiness rises through the finish. Roasted qualities work, never bitter nor burnt. While not blazing any new trails, different enough to hold your attention."
"A nicly crafted beer, if a little safe. If its a dubbel, its apretty mild version, but still firly satisfying and a nice chngeo pace from some o the other winter brews. Pour a very dark brown with a reddih glow to it and fairly good clarity, but you can't relly see through i unlss you hold it up to the light. Some light aroma of Belgian yeast with a slight bit of toasted grain come throuh on the nose. Similar inthe taste- sort of like a classic brown ale bu with light Belgian yest notesand the barest touc of sweetness. Very restrained earthy an citrusy hops. I like it as a basic winter sipper."
"Drinkability: I must say, this really doesn't seem like much of a dubbel. Still, a very drinkable beer and good for sessioning during the winter. Not quite a disappointment, but still could be so much better."
"Drinkability: Not a bad beer and probably a good winter seasonal. Nevertheless, it feels like it's missing something and isn't living up to its full potential."
"Not your classic Dubbel, but as the website says: brewed ""stylistically reminiscent of a Belgian Abbey Double"" so that is ok with me."
"Drinkability overall is okay, but I'm not sure I'd buy this one again. It isn't bad, but it has some funky flavors that stick out and diminish the overall enjoyment."
"D - overall a pretty good beer. well put together - nothing seems out of balance here."
"Drinkability: I'm not sure if I could drink this beer after beer however, paired with a good meal its a really good beer and one I would definitely drink again."
"From the 12 fl. oz bottle marked May-10. Sampled on November 20, 2009. It pours a rich mahogany brown with about a half inch creamy beige head. Kind of atrractive. Full bodied aroma of caramel malts with a bit of fresh hops on the tail end. The mouthfeel is medium to heavy with a creamy sensation to it. There is a nice comfortable balance of malts and hops. Not as yeasty as most Dubbels I have tried. It is slightly bitter and warming. Very nice overall."
"The brew is light on the palate and drinkable, just isnt going to make me rebember it to ""have to"" try later on down the road. I expected much more when I picked it up."
"Spicy peppery flavor up front that lingers over the medium malty body into a medicinal cough syrup flavor with some dark fruit notes, mostly cherries, raisin and plum. Nice subtle dry hops in the finish."
"Really great late fall beer that really exceeds my expectations, even from Smuttynose. Not as well-constructed as some other and not really fit to be considered a ""dubbel", but worth the small investment."
"Sampled through the effortsBentkentk56 and Secret Bunny 09 BIF."
"Mouthfeel is a bit undercarbonated, kind of light and slick. Odd beer, from a brewery that I normally put way up on a pedestal. Felt like it never really grabbed an identity. The oddly buttery diacetyl note killed it for me, without that, add another letter grade at least."
"Final Thoughts - I keep changing my thoughts on Smutty Nose. This beer is wonderful. Definitely different from some of the winter offerings. Smutty Nose, I am beginning to love you more and more every day."
"I wonder how many Smutty's have been consumed in Alaska? This one was honored by being poured into a Midnight Sun goblet, where it looked very inviting. It was medium brown, but deep copper when held to light, and clear. Decent tan head with retention faded to a film and ring. Spotty lacing. SMELL is of a bunch of things at once. Sweet caramel malty, lightly roasty, grainy, nutty, fruity esters and it has some legs. TASTE is smooth and balanced. Sweet caramel malty flavors are backed and balanced by a respectable hop presence. It is a bit boozy, nutty and fruity. Tasty and fairly complex. FEEL is moderately strong tingling early on, too much I thought. It seemed to fade later. Body is medium full with a pleasant rich texture emerging before the clean finish with some restrained bitterness and dryness. OVERALL yum. Very easy to toss this one back. Many of the categories were close to being scored one step up. I liked it alot."
"D: I could sip on a few of these. I don't know if a dubbel is the proper classification for this, but it is tasty. I really have enjoyed this beer. Thanks John!"
"Very good. I would definitely try again as with most Smuttynose brews I have tried."
"Interesting beer, not sure it's one I'd seek out if I wanted a Dubbel, but I could see ordering one after shoveling snow for a couple of hours."
"D: Unassuming dubbel with good easy drinkability without being overpowering. Nicely balanced dubbel by an american brewery!"
"The color is a dark mahogany brown with a respectable off-white head and great lacing. The aroma is grassy oatmeal malt, sour mash sort of deal. The taste is a relatively smooth wheat with some charcoal under a fine carbonation. A medium drinkable brew with a dry paper edge. Alcohol is medium and overall I give this one an average grade, not bad."
"Loads of sweet malts and piney flavors. Very smooth with fairly low carbonation. Various spice notes are abundant but not quite identifiable...maybe some ginger snaps and sugar cookies. Very enjoyable brew, my first Smuttynose. I do believe I will be seeking them out in the future."
"Overall: A little too sweet for me. Reminded me an awful lot of the Mad Elf, which is a completely different style but has many of the same tastes."
"D: A different take on a winter ale. Good, just not great. Sweet but do not think it should be classified as a dubbel at all."
"Overall it's not bad, but it doesn't hold a candle to the other Smuttynose products I've tried. There's a bit too much unblended alcohol in the finish. At 6.8% it shouldn't be that harsh in my opinion."
"Overall: Maybe this brew has been changed over the years but i found it to be quite enjoyable and it seems to be rated a bit low IMHO. But then again within the style of dubbel there are certainly much better brews out there. Very enjoyable winter brew"
"D- a solidly balanced beer that gets my thorugh the new england winter nights"
"This is decent. Recommended if you like the style. It's all around a little weird, but don't let that stop ya from trying one."
"d: very different than other winter ales I have had in the past, perfect on a cold day"
"12 oz bottle. A dark red/amber pour, but a good amount of light can get through. Miniscule white head. Sweet malt, raisin, biscuity aromas. Tastes a bit more red fruity than the nose, but still with some sweet malt and a bit of spicyness. Light medium bodied, finishes with a hoppy cleanliness. Drinkability is solid, the slight uptick in abv could make that a bit dangerous. Really not sure how this is a dubbel, but for me that is good since I don't care for them. Not a bad little winter warmer at all."
"This is the perfect beer for procrastinating; it is slow, complex and makes you feel warm and cozy. A good winter ale, just what I needed before going out to shovel, or maybe I will sip a bit slower and savor this one as long as I can."
"D - A unique beer that's difficult to pin a style on. I suppose ""dubbel"" fits it well enough but it's definitely much softer and much more mild. Great mix of flavors going on here and extremely drinkable."
"D: I prefer Smuttynose's sweet Winter Ale to the other spicy or hoppy versions. The beer is a combo of true Belgian yeast with west coast American hops to continue to redefining of beer in America. Smuttynose has some gosh darn good talent near their vats."
"D_Pretty much average all around. A decent winter ale but nothing too memorable. For a dubbel it lacks the Belgian kick."
"Pours a dark mahogony and puts up a rich, 2-finger off white head - smells of bread malts and yeast with dark fruits - taste of cherry, figs, dates and maybe some oats - a smooth sipper and an easy drinker - medium bodied - a good winter warmer  - Cheers!"
"Tastes fine..I was expecting a winter warmer, not a Dubbel, but hey, still good for a winter offering. Worth trying."
"Na Zdravje!"
"Carbonated but not mouth clearing, this one didn't do it for me. A beer that doesn't have a direction to go in, almost as if it is not sure what it should be. OK, but not great."
"Drinkability: Probably my least favorite style of beer. Not complex at all and very little aroma. I don't see a reason why you would reach for this beer over another."
"D: All around good. No hint of the alcohol content."
"Overall its easy sippin. Goes down easy and refreshing, if you're thirsty. Its nothing too complex though, if thats what you're lookin for. So I was a little disappointed in that aspect."
"The drink is heavy-medium in body with a fine spritz of carbonation. An inoffensive beer, but not one of my favorite dubbels."
"Appearance deep dark chestnut not much head or lacing. Probably shouldn't have poured into imperial pint - just see now it is a dubbel. Malty with boozey earthy finish though mild. Okay mouthfeel nothing more than average body and carb which makes it very drinkable."
"Poured a rich reddish brown color with a small head that disappears quickly.Nose has a nice malt and holiday spice aroma,not too overpowering.Taste is light and well balanced.The mixture of malt and spice flavors is much better than some winter ales."
"D: On the whole, this is a good, drinkable beer. Not the best dubbel I've had, but well done nonetheless."
"Poured a maple-syrup brown into my goblet with a single-finger tan head that quickly fizzled out to nothing. Aroma is very malty, with fruit, apricot, breadiness, reminded my wife of barley malt that she is going to use to make some fresh bread. Light but sticky, slippery body with some good carbonation. Taste is caramel, dates, brown bread, toffee, lots of malty sweetness with a bit of a hop bite toward the finish. Sweetness is balanced out well with the bitterness. Drinkability is very high due to the good balance and tolerable ABV. Overall I like the taste of this beer although I am unfamiliar with the style; a good introduction to Smuttynose offerings."
"A very enjoyable brew during the holidays. A bit more complex and enjoyable as it gets warmer."
"I really, really wanted to like this beer because a) I've been impressed by everything else from Smuttynose and b) the label hands down gets my vote for most awesome. But I was left wondering if this was actually a dubbel, or a hopped up brown ale, or, I dunno, a Belgian dark...Maybe just call it a winter warmer and be done with it."
"The taste will not disappoint. This is medium bodied beer, modestly carbonated, with a nice heavy fruit flavored base, some roasted maltiness, a sweet caramel flavor throughout, and just enough of a hoppy bitterness in the finish to top this very good beer off. There is a nice malty and hop balance to the beer. There is almost a sweet nutty partially roasted quality to the beer that is complemented very nicely by the character of the hop. I had this beer a few weeks ago and I specifically sought it out to review. I'm glad I did. A great beer out of Smuttynose Brewery. L'Chaim."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, leaning to the lighter side. Not a lot of complexity-Belgian how-did-they-do-that? bt nonetheless a decent Dubbel.If you've never tried this style of beer, give this a shot to experience a solid American brewery's take on a Belgian classic. I enjoyed this beer and will drink it again this winter season."
"D - Very drinkable, not overpowering too overpowering. A nice winter beer."
"I poured this into a pint glass, but I'm glad I did. This is a very drinkable Dubbel (assuming that's what it actually is). Low on the phenolics. Tastes more like a Winter Warmer or something."
"Drinkability - warming and balanced. good showing for this year's winter seasonal."
"D - This is very drinkable for 6.8%. I'm a big fan of the Smuttynose products. Love the labels!"
"D: Overall, a pretty solid warming winter beer. I wish that it were less carbonated because it could be much better if so. I could have a couple on a winter night."
"Not my favorite offering from Smuttynose, but a good brew nonetheless that I'm sure I will enjoy throughout the season."
"At first this tasted like a homebrew gone awry but it mellowed out and came together as it warmed up. I recommend this one out of the cellar instead of out of the fridge."
"I thought of it more as a winter warmer type than the style it is listed as,but no disrespect as it was good."
"D: I got really excited about this beer when I picked it up. I got even more excited when I learned it was similar to a Dubbel. Unfortunately, this beer does not approach the level of richness, complexity, and class of a dubbel. Big deductions for mislabeling this one. In all, I have enjoyed many Smuttynose beers, but this is certainly one exception."
"I gotta be honest, this beer is not bad, but that fact that Smuttynose's website calls it ""stylistically reminiscent of a Belgian Abbey Double"" bothers me. I don't care what kind of yeast it has, it simply does not rise to level to of a dubbel - it lacks the complexity and finesse on every level. That said, it's really not bad in and of itself. It pours an attractive clear brown with little in the way of foam. It has a faint aroma of sweet malts and cloves and tastes like a sweetened brown ale. It's finely carbonated medium body and pleasant flavor make it eminently drinkable."
"Overall I was pleasantly surprised with this brew. Almost porter/stout-like burnt flavor but more malty and sweeter. I will definately buy more of these."
"pours a nice brown, minimal head and lacing. kind of a slightly burnt sweetness in the aroma. sweet malt was the first phrase that came to mind. the taste is smooth and balanced. the balanced taste and smooth finish make this highly drinkable. another solid brew from smutty."
"A solid winter brew from Smuttynose."
"* Overall, this is a decent beer that I'm happy to be drinking. Really nothing amazing given the number of great beers that fit within this style, but nothing wrong with going local."
"Poured a dark red/brown with a thin coco brown head that went away almost immediately. No lacing to speak of. Smelled of sweet malts and hints of dark fruit. Taste starts off slightly tart with sweet malts and traces of dark fruits present, maybe raisins or prunes? Mouthfeel is somewhere in between a standard amber and belgian with the tiny bubbles in the carbonation sneaking in there. Drinkability: Seems like I could have a few of these this evening."
"Not as good as some of their other stuff, but it is much better the average beer I must say. Pours a nice dark reddish/brown, with a nice head to it. Smell is faint, which is a tad disappointing. Taste is great though... very smooth with a nice touch of the Belgian sugars at the end and its all smooth and makes for a nice drinkable winter brew. This is 6.8& ABV? That should be a crime.. tastes like a tasty soda."
"For its heft this drinks mightly well. It's getting very difficult to be disappointed by any Smutty offerings these days."
"D: Decent drinkability and a nice winter warmer treat."
"D-Good flavor, easy to drink, and very enjoyable. I would buy again."
"Winter Ales are not my favorite style but this was alright. Poured a dark amber color, small off-white head and some lace. Slightly sweet fruity, vanilla aroma. Somewhat spicy tasting with a sweet maltiness and some fruit. A decent, warming, winter brew."
"Mahogany brew with little to no head and no lacing or retention. Disappointing appearance. Subtle, semi-sweet nose of roasted malts and some spices, sort of like a fruitcake (how apropos to the season). Flavors are of dark fruit, hops in the middle, hints of chocolate and a long malt finish. A robust winter red reminiscent of an Irish red. Medium body seems a little light for a winter beer. Medium carbonation, good mouthfeel. Good, but really not the beer I would turn to for the dark and frigid Vermont months."
"Pours reddish brown and clear with a short lived tan head. Smell is nutty, dark fruitiness, caramel with a faint belgian yeast character, perhaps. Taste is dark fruitiness, caramel, a bit of nuttiness, and is pretty good. Full body with a light to medium carbonation. Pretty solid for a style I don't particularly care for normally. Nice winter brew."
"M + D: A little bit of a sting of carbonation... it could have gone a little smoother for my palate. Otherwise, a reasonably decent take on the style - it comes across to me as something of a little more 'relaxed' style of dubbel, and that it's not meant to be viewed as the same as those coming over from Belgium and the like. Looking at it that way, it's a decent brew and something about it kind of does have that ""yuletide feeling"" Worth a shot."
"-Oelergud"
"Drinkability is nice. It is not too strong for a dubbel, so that helps. A very average offering for a dubbel. I guess it would not have been that bad as a starter dubbel for someone who had never tried the style before."
"Decent stuff from Smuttynose, and a good winter-time brew..."
"Not what one would expect from a winter warmer, and a rather simple beer, but I could easily down a few of these one night."
"This beer pours a dark reddish brown with a medium bodied but tall tan colored head that laced the glass all the way down. It smells of very sweet roasted malts, some spices, and a hint of alcohol. The taste is good with a deep roasted but sweet malt base followed by some spices like cinnamon and some others I couldn't put my finger on, then some fruity taste, and finally a very slight hoppy finish with a nice aftertaste of chocolate. Not much detection of the alcohol I was expecting from the nose. The mouthfeel was good - very fresh and smooth and warming on the way down. The drinkability is quite high and I would easily have a few of these in a session."
"overall, this is a nice beer but i dont really think that it is one of my favorites"
"Overall- I believe this beer has been classified incorrectly, it tastes much more like a Bock than a Dubbel. Still, an amazingly tasty and strong winter brew. Smutty continues to make really decent brews, this is no exception."
"I like the mouth feel it's a bit thick but smooth and the extra alcohol picks it up a bit. I think it would be nice on a cold night with friends and potatoes, sausage, cheese, etc. Standing by its self though I'd like it to be a bit more exciting."
"I found this quite enjoyable and easy to drink. Also not nearly as sweet as others had indicated."
"Overall average: 2.6"
"Verdict: Nice and drinkable! Has the hallmarks of the style as well. I think it's solid. Drinkable."
"This wasn't bad. I liked the full, rich tastes of the malt and spices that leant themselves well to Winter imbibing and that nearly 7% ABV was very well hidden and kept things fairly drinkable. A solid effort from Smutty!"
"D - I would have another and buy again. The Belgian characteristics just aren't as pronounced as they should be. BUT still a very good beer."
"This one certainly warms you up and could drink several in a row, but would probably opt for some lighter fare after 2 or 3."
"Anyway. It's an ok brown ale. Interesting faint caramel/chocolate/bisccuit nose and mouth. Interesting, but, well, not that interesting. It says winter ale, I want it to be hearty. With this thin mouth it's far from that. It's closer to what I drink when it's really hot out. Whatever, I guess. To each their own."
"Smutty never fails to deliver a quality brew."
"Very drinkable, hides the alchohol pretty well, considering the abv. while not my favorite winter selection, i could definitely session this one."
"Mouthfeel is smooth and the carbonation is fine. Fairly drinkable, but the spices wear on me. Not bad, but not Smuttynose's finest. Altogether a strange mix and a mash up of a winter warmer and dubbel. I would have preferred more of a yeasty flavor and less of a spiced flavor."
"D-I hade no idea this was supposed to be a dubbel when I reviewed it. However, it does explain the yeastiness in the aroma and flavor. I would expect a larger, creamier, long lasting head, but of course I already dinged ot for this in the Appearance. Overall it is a nice beer winter warmer or debbel."
"not too bad for a seasonal, but there are better dubbels out there"
"Served in a standard pint glass. Poured a dark ruby-brown with cranberry colored highlights when backlit. Two-fingered off-white head settled into an oily skim of foam. Lacing consisted of concentric rings adhering to the glassware as the brew was consumed. Smell of malt and subtle scent of candied dark-fruit (not sure what though) and yeast. Taste similar to nose with more pronounced dark fruit flavors (plums, prunes, raisins) present, but not particularly sweet. Nice mouthfeel, but somewhat more watery than other dubbels I have sampled, ending with a pleasant malty finish. A nice seasonal, although at 6.8% abv, a little on the high-side for a session brew; however, I could definitely quaff 2 or 3 in a sitting."
"Drinkability: Definitely a good winter brew, and a good experiment, with both the Belgian flavors and the hoppiness to combine into something really interesting and refreshing. I like to have it a few times each winter, and I hope they keep making it for the season."
"D: I didn't particularly care for this beer, so I really wouldn't seek it out again. As I mentioned above, it seems too boozy for an under-7% ABV beer."
"Poured into a SA glass a nice brownish color, nice carbonation, nice one-finger plus creamy tan head, nice sticky lacing remains. The nose is malty, slightly yeasty, slight hints of dark fruits, and caramel. The taste is slightly sweet, malty/yeasty, dark fruits, and some caramel. Medium body. Drinkable, a some what different Dubbel, but very tasty, recommended."
"D: very drinkable. I like this Smutty very much."
"Pours a clean, clear, ruby with brown color into a pint glass. One finger of off-white head dissipates quickly. Aroma of nutmeg and maple mix with a spiciness from the hops. Flavor is heavy on the malt - as a good winter ale should be - and again the spiciness comes through, more maple and brown sugar flavor. Finishes with a malty sweetness. Becomes increasingly drinkable, quite enjoyable."
"Taste is also quite malty but not in a sweet way, now the spice kicks in. Touches of fruit, decent carbonation, can make out the alcohol a bit. Could have benefited from being more sweet though."
"Nice amber/ruby color. Very little carbonation. A fairly hard pour left a half finger of head that dissipated quickly. There is a strange sharpness in the smell that I can't quite put my finger on. Body was very weak at first, but came out more as the beer warmed. Hints of maple and caramel. Finishes very clean with little aftertaste. Very smooth mouthfeel, almost too clean. Heavier carbonation would be appreciated."
"Not a bad brew. Nice winter beer for sure and an interesting take on a dubbel. It seems to me like a cross between a dubbel and a winter warmer, but without the spice of either."
"D:For a winter beer this was very drinkable. If I was at any other bar I would have had a second."
"Had this one on tap at Mahars. Poured to a nice dark amber color with a good sized tan head. Nice retention, left a lot of lacing down the side of the glass. The aromas remind me of berries, caramel malts, with a slight yeast quality. The flavors seem to revolve around the malt flavors giving it a toasted feel with a yeast like biscuit taste. When looking up this brew it really surprised me to see it as a dubbel, as the characteristics of a dubbe did not come out for me. Even with this being said this was a good brew, very nice flavor and quite easy drinking. I would get this one again without question."
" Very, very interesting and certainly one of the more thought provokeing winter ale's around."
"Pours a hazy nut brown color with a smallish tan head that dissipated into a slight cap. The smell is light, I pick up some nut and slight fruit aromas. The brew has a steely roasted malt base, which has some nutty characteristics. There is also some dark fruit notes that sweeten up the taste. If this is truely a dubbel, it is definitely not as sweet as it's Belgian counterparts. I can't say that I pick up any Belgian candi sugar sweetness. The feel is moderate with moderate carbonation, finishes well balanced. A very enjoyable brew and a good winter brew to try. It is not spiced up like some winters and it is nice and balanced."
"D: Drinks well. I could easily put down 3-4 in an evening. This will be a good one for parties."
"I poured this brewsky into my tumbler at 50 degrees. The beer was a nice mahogany color with a fine tan head. Unfortunatly that did not last very long. It did lace well though. The smell was slightly sweet as was the taste with a hint of toffee. I really liked this beer as it was a nice dark beer but not thick like tar. I think it is a great beer for folks wanting to break into the dark realm. I will buy again for sure."
"This beer has a decent auroma although it is slightly lacking in flavor. There just isn't really a lot going on in this beer."
"The alchol is strong in this one. So is the carbonation. The sweet malt reminds me of a barleywine here. Texture is creamy and drinkable but the taste is still pucker inducing. Some spice; maybe nutmeg? Certain;ly has some flavor, but not really my style. I'll stop at one."
"pours a chestnut color with a half inch light tan head that quickly fades to the beer, some lace to start with that also quickly fades away. some aromas of caramel and roasted malt and a sharp scent of alcohol. taste is of roasted malt, slight caramel with some brown sugar.slightly oily slick mouthfeel, light to medium body with a carbonation that sort went flat. i don't think i'll be buying this beer again."
"I love a good dark winter ale, and I've always enjoyed Smuttynose. I don't know if I got a bad batch or what, but it seems that this one could be better than it was. It has a lovely dark brown hue and a nice smell, but it seemed a tad undercarbonated. Although it had a great, complex flavor, the somewhat low fizz took away from the enjoyment. I'm chalking it up to bad luck - I'm going to give this one another try."
"Stick this one in a chalice or snifter. I figured it was a typical winter warmer and put it in a pint glass, probably losing something on the nose."
"I was never really all that interested in trying this beer, as I tend to gravitate toward the Belgian examples of this style, but the other night there was nothing very interesting at the store up the street, and the label art is quite charming. Pours a average looking chestnut brown color, with little head, but a nice looking ring lace around the glass. Smell had brown sugar, chocolate, various spices, and a bit of fruity alcohol. Taste was largely characterized by fruits, mainly plums, cherries, strawberries, with a backbone of malt and chocolate. Mouthfeel is in the middle I would say. Not too much hop usage, but the little that is there helps to balance the malt. This is one of the more drinkable Dubbels I have tasted in a while. If I was to have it in a blind tasting, I would probably guess that this came from Belgium. Another very good beer from Smuttynose."
"A nice brown color but very little head. The aroma was sweet and carmel-like. A complex taste of sweet, bitter and toasted malt. The aftertaste is a definite smoky malt taste. This is a full bodied brew with a nice even carbonation. The aftertaste lingers in the mouth with the smoky malt flavors. A good beer to serve on a cold day, but the complexity of flavors and smoky aftertaste make this too much of a beer to have more than one or two."
"I'll have a few more this winter."
"This beer seems to have characteristics of a brown ale, a winter warmer, and a belgian dubbel but doesn't strike me as being distinctly any one of the three. Whatever it is it exhibits typical Smuttynose quality and is quite delicious. I'll be buying more."
"The fruitiness has emerged and made this a better beer with a little time, but with the green apple tartness rearing up-- even though what it has added is generally pleasant so far-- I think it will likely go downhill quickly with additional time."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not very filling, decent representation of style, it might not be your prototypical winter seasonal, but it's still a pretty nice beer. I could certainly drink quite a few of these in an evening."
"I nice mellow dark Belgian.The flavor isn't too rich or complex, but it's fairly spot on for the Belgian basics. Just sweet, fruit, candy and malt flavors. It's at least as good as Leffe Brune/Brown. If you can find it for a reasonable price, I recommend it."
"Very nice beer."
"This beer seems to have characteristics of a brown ale, a winter warmer, and a belgian dubbel but doesn't strike me as being distinctly any one of the three. Whatever it is it exhibits typical Smuttynose quality and is quite delicious. I'll be buying more."
"Cheers!"
"D: Was nice to see a brewery do a winter ale that's not just a cinnamon & nutmeg bomb, and this is pretty solid. It's a nice stab at the style, but it obviously won't displace Chimay Red or Westmalle in the Dubbel camp. Pretty good."
"Very drinkable. Reminds me of Anchor OSA a bit (2006). Not as spicy, though. A hoppy brown ale with spices."
"Some nice lacing present. The flavor is malted and balanced. It ends nice and clean, without lingering. The 6.8% is buried but not lost. Not offensive...i will actually enjoy finishing this one."
"Damn, what a little find this is! I wish I would have been drinking this all winter! It was very easy to drink as well. I knew that a Dubbel was a very atypical choice for a winter seasonal, but this is quite a nice beer. Some nice cheddar would be great with it. This will definitely become an annual part of my winter cellar, and I highly recommend this little sleeper. A great bang for the buck for those Belgian fans. Definitely check this out."
"The beer pours a hazy ruby red color with a thick frothy offwhite head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a pale and crystal malt scent along with a fruity Belgian yeast aroma. The taste is good. It has a dry, hoppy flavor that is laid over a malt bill of Belgian pale and crystal malts. It's robust with some roasted notes. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a fine seasonal brew. It's tastey and highly drinkable."
"Drinkability - Not quite as strong flavors as many other dubbels, but still pretty good. Very smooth and easy to drink."
"Pours a dark amber bordering on burgandy, with lots of lacing and pretty nice light tan head, down to a thin film. With the aroma and taste, its quite malty, yeasty, biscuts, fruits and clove, a little honey perhaps, everything a good dubbel should have, but, as 'winter ale' would imply, it leans a bit more on certain spices that give it that warmer quality. There is a mild warming, good body, really a good beer and a easy quaffer."
"This beer is cherry-wood colored with a lot of fine head. The beer has a hoppy smell. Taste is very spicy, like Lakefronts holiday beer (but not like a dubbel). Mouthfeel is a bit watery."
"The taste is very good with strong malts and mild hops. The taste is sweet with a very mild alcohol flavor. I also detect a bit of graininess. The MF is medium bodied and is both spicy and tangy."
"Poured a medium brown with the slightest red hue. Small head of large carbonation bubbles. Spicey, nutty, malty. Alcohol is very well masked, i would have guessed it was closer to 5%. very creamy despite its watery appearance. fulfilling on the palate. bit of sweetness and very moderate hops."
"Pours a rust amber color with a nice and bubbly off-white head. Nose is of spicy malt and faint hops. Big taste of spicy citric notes, some bitter malt, and fruit. Good carbonation and mouthfeel. Another wonderful brew from Smuttynose that hit the spot on a cold winter night."
"D- No question . Great ."
"Tilted dark with significant white head. Some brown flecks of spice including cardamon and allspice. More spice than yeast aroma. Not that strong alcohol. Medium mouthfeel, cross-style Belgian and winter warmer. Neither hits the spot of either, but certainly not unpleasant."
"Thanks JB."
"Quite nice. I am enjoying this more than I have some ""authentic"" Belgian dubbels."
"Pours a nice, slightly cloudy, dark mahogany in color with a two finger light tan head and some nice sticky lacing. Nice smell, sweet malts, and some earthy hops. As for the taste, nice sweet caramel malts, a hint of breadiness, and nice earthy hops. Nice mouthfeel, medium amount of carbonation, solid body. Good drinkability. This is a great beer for a cold winter's night."
"Poured into pint glass. Poured a dark red-brown. Very little head that quickly disappeared. Very little aroma, slight sweet maltyness hiding. Tasted of medium spice with a touch of bitterness that isn't very noticable. Carbonation could be tasted despite the lack of head. Tasted ok in the mouth. Very easy to drink. I would expect a winter beer to be slightly spicier, but other than that its a solid beer."
"Overall, a drinkable beer with some very interesting merits, and something I'd probably buy again to test out, but not something I'm crazy about. Drinkable, for sure, just not great."
"Overall a decent dubbel and a good winter brew. The drinkability is average based on some of the off flavors."
"D - Not bad but nothing special either."
"D - This on the low point of a Winter Ale. Not to crazy about it. I won't be drinking this again."
"Poured into a goblet a very deep brown a thin quick to fade light brown head set atop no lace left behind,alot of diferent things going on in the nose somewhat medicinal and herbal with notes of chocolate and dark fruit as well.Seemd a bit sharp in the mouth and not real full,flavors seem a bit dumbed down somewhat yeasty with cola-like flavors and dark fruit but they really dont assert themselves much.The sharp mouthfeel becomes more assertive as I drink more really making it less drinkable.Eh not my thing here I dont drnk many of the style but I look a well made dubbel,Iam sorry but this falls a bit short."
"Poured out a hazy copper color with a big tan head, not much in the way of lacing. The nose offered malt, caramel, some green hop, and spice. The taste started biscuity, followed by minimal spice, some herbal notes, and a slightly bitter hop finish. Moderate carbonation, and fairly easy drinking for a big beer. Pleasent but not outstanding."
"This is a nice seasonal from one of my favorite locals. Had I rated this to the Dubbel style, I think I may have scored it lower. However, I think Smuttynose is successful in creating a truly unique winter ale."
"Drinkability is okay but nothing too spectacular. A somewhat disappointing effort from a good brewery."
"Pours brown with a redish hue,and thin tan head. Not much in the way of retention, but good lace. Smell is not strong, and is of malt,and dark fruits. Body is medium to thick,with a bit of carbionation. Taste is dark fruits, up front with a nice hop finish. Nicely warmed in the finish as well."
"D: Definitely will be drinking this again this winter. Also, would like to cellar a few."
"D-One of the better winter offerings out there....certainly top 25%...Never feels like a huge sipping style beer but there is no doubt this has some depth to it...."
"Overall, not a bad winter ale, definitely more on the sweet side than I like, but not bad."
"Strong presence of sweet Belgian sugars and that unique, funky Belgian yeast quality. Thick and syrupy mouthfeel with a touch of spices. Juicy tasting with fig and prune flavors."
"Pours a ruddy brown with a tan head. Plenty of lacing down the side of my goblet. Aroma of caramel with hints of spice and brown sugar. Belgian yeast is apparent along with a whiff of alcohol. The mouthfeel is medium-bodied and softly carbonated. Grainy and bready malt flavors are combined with hints of dark chocolate. Intriguing yeast influences the flavor throughout. The finish has a light spiciness to it. Very smooth and drinkable for a dubbel. Alcohol isn't overwhelming at 6.8% either. A 'must-try' winter warmer."
"It goes down pretty easily, but not what I, personally, would look for in a ""winter ale", though the alcohol does leave a bit of a ""warming"" effect (though it seems to rely too much on the alcohol for this.) I do give Smuttynose credit for trying something different. But, it's a decent amber ale with a Belgian twist - interesting to try, and a decent effort...but, doesn't turn out to be anything special. Decent, but a burnt toast flavor keeps this one back...It seems like it can't decide between an amber and a Belgian and lurks somewhere in between. In the end, it's okay, but nothing great. I expected more from such a good brewery."
"Not a bad beer by any means, just not quite my style. If you're a belgian fan, this one's all you. Enjoy!"
"Taste is a mix of coriander, cinnamon spice, chocolateyness, a bit of an alcohol kick, and a bitterness that rounds it all out nicely. A nice winter ale for sure."
"So, now that you know my bias, this one hits the mark. I'll leave the color and etc for the many other reviews already noted. If you have a chance, pick up some and enjoy!"
"Clear burgandy. Nice looking thin beads of carbonation surface at a good clip. Thin beige head leaves some sporadic lace. Nice aroma of cherry juice, raisins, prune, belgian yeastiness and breadiness. Yes, very nice. First impressions are of bread pudding, poundcake and rum. A little raisin. A little chocolate. All in all, a pleasant blend. Mouthfeel is very agreeable. Light carbonation and light body. Easy drinking, tasty beverage."
"12 ouncer, best before date (March, 07) notched on the label. Pours dark honey amber, pretty clear, sporting a dark tan head, that leaves scattered slippery lacing, nose on this one is of smokey raisins and some malts. Smokey, oily offering, I dont get too many ""Dubbel"" feelings here, this hits my taste buds and other senses as a smoked up, wintery brew. Dry finish, cant say I'm in love with this stuff, perhaps as a cold weather nightcapper"
"Interestingly strong bitter flavor, but not a whole lot more to it."
"Overall, a beautiful beer! Rich, satisfying, complex, drinkable... what more can you ask for?"
"Dark brown body with ruby-red highlights and a finger of off-white head that dissipates quickly and leaves little lacing. Smells like banana with hints of yeast and citrus. Tastes like banana, citrus, and nut. Medium-bodied, but a little lighter than I was expecting for the style. A pretty nice dubbel though, but not the best I've had."
"Appearance - Medium brown/amber. Mild cloudiness like a glass of iced tea with a splash of OJ. Off white creamy head of about two fingers in depth. Smells of sweet caramel malt, spicy banana and alcohol. Taste is similar to a lightly sweetened tea cake with raisins in it. Nice hop presence and is balanced out by a nutty caramel malt backbone. Mouthfeel is creamy on the tongue, with medium carbonation. Another fine beer from Smuttynose. This is my first winter beer of the season and it won't be my last. Would like to sample this on tap with a few others in this style on a 30-40 degree evening."
"I recall first trying this beer last year on its debut. I remember liking it, but really wanted to try it again. It smells like Christmas in your glass. It's brown, malty, a little spicy and totally quaffable. A sixer of this will go very fast. By comparison, it's heavier than the Sam, but not as spicy as the Harpoon. It has balance and depth, with a hearty finish."
"Clear auburn with some reddish highlights topped by a very light brown head. The foam receded to a thin cap and left behind just a bit of lace. Malty caramel aroma with a light, bready yeast quality and a hint of fruit. There was a bit of spice in the nose at first, but this disappeared quickly. Low bitterness with not a lot of hop character - malt is dominant in this brew. It has an earthy, nutty, caramel and cocoa flavour with mild fruit rounding it out in the finish. Moderately low, well-integrated carbonation with a body that's lightish, but far from thin. Mild alcohol warmth with a bit of dryness. Quite tasty. Definitely a step above a lot of other winter brews."
"Pours a dark brown, like a dubble should. It smells and tastes of chocolate and slightly of coffee. Don't get me wrong its a good beer but the chocolate/coffee taste is a little too disjoint from the rest of the beer's flavor. This takes away from the complexity and cohesiveness of the beer. It has a nice mouthfeel though. Its adequately carbonated and drinkable. I could have a few of these in an evening."
"There is a nice body on this beer, I will grant that. Medim to full bodied. Other than that, pretty average and not really to style, in my opinion."
"Drinkability: OK, I guess, but definitely not a dubbel"
"This dubble poured a clear, light coffee-brown color with tan foam that settled. The smell was sweetly malty with a touch of Belgian candy sugar and a light vinous aroma. The taste was full of Begian malt with some light candy sugar, though not overly sweet. The hoppiness was mild. The mouthfeel was smooth and creamy and lightly sweet with medium body and good carbonation. The finish was hoppy and the sweet flavor lingered in the aftertaste. This was a very nice, Belgian style ale (not sure if it is a Dubbel, but I like it). Quite enjoyable."
"Malty pumpkin sweet with an astringent finish. Body is thin and somewhat insipid. How is this a dubbel?"
"While Dubbels are not my favorite style, I do like this one because it stays interesting for me. I wouldn't drink it all night but I would certainly enjoy as a change of pace from my typically hoppy ales."
"Good interesting twist on the dubbel that I'm sure I'll pick up again sometime."
"Purs a beautiful dark copper with a beautiful head. Smell is hoppy, fruity..very nice. The taste is a very nice combination of sweetness and tartness. Sweet on the front with a good malt backbone through mid-palate, hoppy light on the finish. Mouthfeel is a similar balance between oily and dry..very good. The drinkabilty factor is high. Overall very smooth with an excellent dry finish."
"Note: Someone else mentioned smoke in their review. The burned flavor and aroma may have been smoke but to me they were just phenolic and not well done. The GoJo aroma came from the fact that every hand that had dipped in the stuff had been welding prior to cleaning the hands. Burned and smoky..."
"After drinking the rest I'm not too keen on the licorice flavor. This may be just a weird batch. I am willing to try this again."
"Winter Ale is a bit of a pastiche (an amber ale that uses Trappist ale yeast and American hops, then calls itself a dubbel), but it works somehow. I'll just chalk it up to the brewing talent at Smuttynose and be done with it. The only thing that really matters is whether or not the beer is delicious. It passes that test with flying colors."
"Worth a shot."
"This brew was a great winter warmer, and it didn't seem like a dubbel on the level of Chimay. The undertones in the aftertaste make up for the lack of bitterness, and this was one of the better winter offerings I've had in quite some time. If only I could find more of their products here in Jersey!"
"nuff said"
"Poured a deep mahagony color with initial moderate tannish head, that rapidly fell to a thin ring. No lacing to be found. Smell gives an aroma of dark fruit balanced with a firm yeast scent. Extremely pleasant to the nose. Taste brings strong malt notes, the dark fruits (prunes, raisins) continue, and a nice hoppiness begins to present itself. Leaves a very creamy mouthfeel, and the finish melds the malt and hops in appropriate amounts., and lect a very pleasurable taste in the mouth. A very nice drinking beer, and the taste just got better and better as the beer slowly warmed toward room temperature"
"Oh hell no. This is a trainwreck of a beer. Looks ok translucent brown with a white head that dies too quick and little lacing. Smells of sweet spices a little raisin with a hint of green apple. The taste is not right I thought I might have got an off bottle but no after dumping the first bottle the second tasted the same. Slight burnt paper taste covered in sweet malt with a fruityness and cinnamon fake flavor. I guess it has a decent body and it is utterly near undrinkable."
"Drinkability is solid if a bit bland. The early cloying elements seem to settle down a bit and gets a little bit more enjoyable with some warmth."
"I am not finding this brew to be very drinkable...at least tonight."
"A nice drinkable dubbel, one that I would revisit if available (at the right price)... Of course, there are superior Belgian and American versions to be had..."
"Mouthfeel is sweet and lightly malty."
"pours a nice mahogany color with a thin white head that dissipates quickly. The aromas are dried fruit and bread (dare I say fruitcake?) full malty mouthfeel that leaves a candy flavor long after swallowing. There a a number of different flavors melding together nicely, bready yeast flavors and raisin sweet malts, not any hop perception. some real intense dried fruit flavors and the longer it warms, some spice and more and more bisquit flavors."
"Cheers..."
"Pours a deep purple/brown eggplant, I know it isn't purple but it looks like it in the light. It leaves a thin lace head wheat in color. The nose is very fruity black cherries, plum, raisins, grape, very complex with a slight presence of alcohal. The taste is nice starts up front on the palate with a raisin sweetness followed by a grape juice quality. The taste continues with some sight hop bitterness for balance for then finishes refreshing with very light carbonation."
"try."
"Very nice-deep copper color. Really a pretty, almost mahogany hue. Bready and yeasty aroma-quite spicy actually. Big malty aroma-some spiciness to it. Definate belgian type flavor. Mild sweetness though has a somewhat dry finish. Great body-very smooth. A very enjoyable US version of a belgian double. Well worth trying."
"Nice dark bronze color. Starts out with a big 2 finger head that dissipates quickly but leaves a nice fine foam on the top. Smell of dark fruits - cherries and plums. Taste of candied sweetness with a slight Phenolic aftertaste. Mouthfeel is slightly cloying but not overly so. Nice level of carbonation. A nice dubbel, not world class but very nice. Fits the bill for a nice winter beer."
"A clean brownish beer whit red and orange highlights. Has a small tan head. The aroma is a sweet malt with hints of apples and fruit in the background. The taste starts with a dry earthy note that slides into a breif bit of sweet maltiness. Followed by a smooth finish with a bit of tabacco on the back of your tongue."
"Nice malty taste, good over all presentation, it is not the ""let's throw every spice there is in here"" that a holiday brew is, but it is a nice, malty, winter beer that can be drank rather easily. great job by the smutty nose crew"
"another victory for smuttynose."
"This pours a rich reddish brown color with a small head that disappears quickly.The smell has a nice malt and holiday spice aroma,not too overpowering.The m/f is light and well balanced.The mixture of malt and spice flavors is much better than some winter ales.This is a good beer that I will look forward to every winter."
"Poured a dark rust color with intermittent brown hues. A soft head that remained at about 25% of its full size throughout the session and left behind a touch of white lacing. Aromas of malt and Dutch candy seemed to dominate. The taste was an interesting blend of hops and sweet roasted malts with a malty finish that left behind a bready texture. Different spices seemed to come out as well as the beer warmed, indicated that the spices were present in small quantities or overshadowed by the other ingredients. Either way, not a good thing. The alcohol was not dominant in the taste and thus this beer has good drinkability."
"A really interesting brew. Way more exciting than the ubiquitous, over-spiced holiday ales that seem to crowd the liquor store coolers this time of year. Some may not be into the unique flavors from the Belgian yeast, but you'd be foolish not to give it a try."
"Overall- A incredibly bland ale! What little flavor is so watered down. This would be a decent Winter Ale if they kicked the flavor up a notch or two. Very disappointing from such a good brewery!"
"I like Smuttynose brews, but this one was really disappointing to me. Supposedly a Dubbel, but seems very distantly related. Pours a very dark brown with a thin head. Spiciness dominates the nose. The spices don't seem to go with this beer, and there's an overwhelming bubble gum flavor that just cloys and annoys. Personally, I don't like the taste of bubble gum in my beer. There's also a cloying underlying sweetness, and the taste of the spices and bubble gum linger for an unpleasantly long time on the palate. A pretty poor offering for a winter ale from Smuttynose, and one that I find a chore to drink. There's many better choices to be made, and I'm surprised that Smuttynose chose this beer as their annual offering."
"Clear copper colored with a thick beige head that sits a full inch atop the liquid. The head settles out quickly. Aroma of yeast and toffee, cinnamon, and ripe fruits. Flavor is mild Belgian yeast upfront, followed by brown sugar and caramel, mild malt sweetness, with a fine hop bitter riding beneath. Finishes a little peppery. Full and rich mouthfeel with a slight carbonation tingle in the finish."
"I wanted to be wowed, or at least like it a lot, but I came away disappointed, a rarity with Smuttynose. the flavor is jerky and divided, not to mention rather shallow for the style, and the alcohol plays as big a part of the character as anything else. And that's another thing: the ABV seems to rule the roost with an iron claw, latching on and humbling the flavor and aroma, and seriously minimizing the drinkability. And so,it's so-so...and so it goes."
"Thanks to UncleJimbo for the Bottle!!!"
"A nice winter seasonal. A belgian style beer in a mixed 12...I wasn't expecting that, but what a great idea. Perhaps a bit high in the phenols but the spicy quality balances it out. They should kick up the complexity and move it to the Big Beer series."
"The flavors are really nicely blended and tasted great even on the final sip, by which point the beer was almost warm, since I was sipping slowly. This was perhaps the best winter warmer style beer I had this season. Triumph's Winter Wonder was great too, and similar in many respects, so I'd like to drink the two head-to-head to make my final determination."
"I guess this is a Belgian Dubbel. It fits the criteria, but I don't remember having one like this. It IS a very good winter ale, however. Very malty, the spices meld with it really well, and a low hop character. And I swear, this has smoked malt in it, a nice touch, to say the least. Highly recommended."
"This is a good full flavored beer. It's more sweet than spicy like other winter ales, but has a good balance of flavor."
"An interesting take on a ""winter ale"" from Smutty. It is great to see someone trying something new with this style."
"This was refreshing and clean, a good try at a Dubbel. I have to make an obvious statement here that might not seem so obvious. This is a Dubbel style, made by a good American craft brewery, and it's their take on the style. They're not trying to be, lets say, a trappist, but brew in the style, which I feel a lof of the people I see review miss. Maybe I'm letting Smuttynose off easy, but I applaud the try, and although I have yet to get something outstanding from any of their brews including the Big Beer series, I'm continually impressed with their effort and creativity in their takes on traditional (and non-traditional) beers."
"Drinkability - well, I could definitely have more than one of these at a sitting, but the alcohol would be too much. Would prefer this as part of a winter sampler rather than a whole six pack."
"Overall: A disappointing offering, and I have loved a lot of Smutty's stuff. The phenolics, dead mouthfeel, and cloying sweetness of this one are just kind of off-putting. Not epically terrible, but I wouldn't give it to a good friend."
"A rather drinkable dubbel; not too sweet, the sour qualities and spices are well placed. Not the best version of the style, but a nice change of pace for a winter offering."
"Pretty mild tasting considering the style. The flavors that are true to the style are mild as they are in the nose. This is still a pleasant tasting beer and I enjoyed drinking it."
"Another solid representation of the style from the boys up north."
"Hadn't heard of this when I saw it in the store so I had to grab 2 bottles. 12 oz., best by March '06. Pours a rusty red/brown with a small tan head. It looks crimson in the light. Smells of bubblegum, dark fruit, and spiciness, but overall not very strong. It has a fairly smooth, medium body and tastes Belgian with cloves and spiciness from the phenols along with some grassy and musty characteristics. The phenols are nice, but there's not enough other flavors behind them. Good, but needs refinement/more complexity."
"Anyway on with the review. Good, very good, delcious. Smooth with strong alcohol flavors. It does lack that caremel flavors of other dubbels, but this is excellent. I'm gonna have to make this a regular winter brew."
"I didn't really like this beer, but it is a decent beer."
"Pours a one-finger cream head that fades quickly, leaving little lace. Nice clear red/amber color. Light carbonation and medium bodied. Nose has a malty/yeasty overtone. Starts with sort of sweet flavor but is complex with a little spice. You notice the yeast in the finish. $7.49 for a 6-pak 12oz bottles from Hannaford's Concord, NH."
"The body is quite light for the flavor with good mouth fullness. A nice warming beer that I'd look for again."
"For me, doubles (or similar) seem to be the hardest profile to do right. Everything needs to fall right into place or else it ends up being a lackluster drinking experience. This is one that, while being a decent beer, fails to do much for me."
"Drinkability: nicely drinkable and overall a good winter beer."
"If this is a Dubbel, it's a unique one. Pours a deep amber with ruby highlights. Nice herbal qualities in the nose, along with a heaping of winter spices - cinnamon, clove, a touch of caramel. Slightly acidic and bitter, with a flavor profile somewhat reminiscent of Anchor OSA. It's that piney, herbal hop profile. Spicy with a solid layering of hops throughout. Carbonation nips the tip of the tongue before fading into oblivious smoothness. A nice seasonal! One I'd certainly go for again."
"Smuttynose just hit Milwaukee so I was excited to try this. Not sure what style this was when I bought it, but obviously turned out to be a dubbel. The body is deep chestnut and ruby red with beautiful clarity/ The head was made up of very fine carbonation activity. The wonderful Belgian phenolic aroma was evident as soon as the pour began. Fruity spiciness filled the nostrils quite well. The taste was very ""dubbelish"" with its dry, semi-sweet maltness. A small amount of hop bitterness shine through. It seemed a bit too spicy even though I doubt any additional winter-type spices were added. The mouthfeel was a little harsh off the start. Although the dryness is always welcome in a dubbel, it seemed a bit cloying. I believe this would be great after a year in the cellar. I will definately save a 6 pack for next winter. Overall, good, but not yet conditioned to its finest."
"Pours with a light tan head that settles over clear dark reddish liquid tinged with brown. The nose is great, brown sugar, nutty maltiness, hops, fruitiness (very slight banana noted) and light spice. The taste leans towards hoppiness mixing with roast maltiness then some sweetness. The finish is warming, bittersweet and long. A nice surprise this one was!"
"Not knowing this was a dubbel, I poured it into an imperial pint glass. A crystal clear ruby read beer appeared with a huge slightly tan head. Pretty good head retention too, with nearly microscopic bubbles rising throughout the beer, and nice lacing as the head fades. Aroma is belgian spicy esters (coriander and clove, mainly), with a hint of hops (but more hops than one would find in a true Belgian). Not that the hops are out of place - they actually balance out the aroma nicely. Taste is quite complex - some licorice, more cloves, a slightly tart malty middle and a spicy semisweet aftertaste with some bananas and bubblegum mingly with a bit of hoppy bitterness. A slightly slick mouthfeel, leaves a bit of a coating on the tongue. Very tasty brew, and a good take on a spiced winter seasonal that probably contains no actual spices, making it much more subtle (and IMHO) and delicious than some of its more bold cousins (in the winter seasonal category, not the dubbel category)."
