Pretty much is said for the taste as with a hint of bready yeast with a light hint of floral hops also. Actually very smooth to drink with no bitter or hoppy finish. Medium-bodied with perfect carbonation. Overall, Fat Tire did a great job on this brew style.","BeerWithMike","Mar 16, 2015"

Lots of banana, dark fruits, sugary malted toffee.  A boot of alcohol and pepper spice. Taste continues the excellent nose. Toffee flavored malt front. Figs and raisins flow next. Herbaceous biting bitterness gives a bit of a jolt but it works so well. A light coffee lingers with mocha notes as it fades to hops.  Feel is to notch. Full and smooth with a creamy carbonation. Not a session ale but quite easy drinking. A superb dubbel period. Love this one.","scootny","Dec 24, 2014"

I am not a huge fan, nor an expert on this style of beer, but I will have to say, this is one nice brew. Taste is spectacular with fresh baked pastry and sweet malt notes. I also get some banana and molasses also. Feels, light on the palate with some minor alcohol twang, but that's ok, this is a nice beer and very drinkable !","hophugger","Dec 22, 2014"

4.1,2.2,4,4,4,4,4.5,"12 ounce bottle into signature globe glass, best before 9/21/2014. Pours lightly cloudy deep reddish copper color with a 1-2 finger fairly dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of caramel, toast, biscuit, light chocolate, raisin, plum, banana, clove, pepper, candi sugar, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of fruity/spicy yeast ester and dark/bready malt notes; with good strength. Taste of big caramel, toast, biscuit, light chocolate, raisin, plum, banana, clove, pepper, candi sugar, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Light earthy bitterness and moderate yeast spice on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, toast, biscuit, light chocolate, raisin, plum, banana, clove, pepper, herbal, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice complexity of fruity/spicy yeast and dark/bready malts; with a great malt/yeast balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a very smooth, crisp, and lightly bready/chalky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent dubbel style. All around great balance and complexity of fruity/spicy yeast and dark/bready malt flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","May 10, 2014"

4.13,3,4,4,4.25,3.75,4.25,"Poured from a bottle into a Chimay goblet/chalice. Color is right on the money as it is a dark reddish amber. I thought the head was a little thin, and it didn't persist as long as I thought it should. It may be slightly under carbonated, and if I were to grade it down in one area in particular it would be mouthfeel. That said, it is very clear (don't think this beer is bottle-conditioned) and is in the right ballpark as far as the complexity of flavor you would expect from a Belgian Dubbel (raisin, clove spiciness, etc.). It leaves scattered lacing on the side of the glass. Maybe the slightest taste of alcohol but very subtle. Overall I really enjoyed this beer and will come back to it again (it was half the price of a Chimay Red 4-pack which, while superior, is not an everyday beer).","TangoMike","May 06, 2014"

Rather light bodied, maybe medium, with a smoothness that belies the dark fruit and sweet tastes b/c there are some raisins and figs in here, possible other fruits like tropical but can't get a handle on them, but there is also a great underlying sweetness to this beer that I can only describe as really sweet (caramel, the figs, toffee, candi sugar, sweet fruit...just can't pinpoint it). A rather light and easy to drink Belgian style ale that is quite enjoyable.","clayrock81","Apr 30, 2014"

Unlike its brother Abbey doesn't have much tartness at all. The malt body reminds me of a dopple bock (makes sense seeing as this a Belgian dubbel) a lot of specialty grains went into the mash for this. Chocolate and sweet sugars are very prevalent. This is really smooth and drinkable especially for 7% abv. All the flavors come through cleanly and in full force. The hop presence is negligible.","Theheroguy","Dec 24, 2013"

I think the head was fairly white but missed it looking at the color of the beer. If I had to make an educated guess it was white with just a tiny tinge of brown. Smell is definitely Belgian sweetness that I haven't smelled in a while. Been a while since I drank Belgians. Really sweet, banana, yeasty smell that is just heaven to the nose. Maybe it's just cause I haven't drank a Belgian lately but just smells amazing. Taste is much like the nose. Definate Belgian yeasty taste like bananas and cloves. REALLY tasty. Mouthfeel is a lighter medium and definitely fits the style. Overall I am really surprised how much I like this beer. Just got a mixed 12er for session beer tonight and thought I'd give this a try. Glad I did because of this beer.","NeedBeerHere","Dec 06, 2013"

It’s good to see that the brewery, while following the path blazed by a lot of the California and Oregon breweries with multiple IPAs and numerous other hop-forward beers, that when they turn back to their Belgium-inspired beers, they can still produce some of the best in the country.

Taste is very sweet upfront, maybe apples, bananas, and asssorted other fruits. The finish is dry and yeasty, but not bad. I've had a few other Belgian ales where the finish was so yeasty I just didn't like it. Here it is more restrained. I like the mouthfeel. Lots of carbonation.

Smell is of malt, spices, Belgian yeast, and a very nice banana bread aroma. Taste is much the same with a banana bread flavor on the finish. There is a mild amount of spice bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel.

The smell is full of dry fruits like fig, raisins, and apricots, and provides a great preview of what is to come. The taste is very good in terms of showcasing fruity esters, but the overall flavoring s short of what is hinted at by the aroma. There is a bit too much simplicity and dilution in the flavor department. The feel in the mouth is slippery, oily, and smooth. The beer goes down easy, but I want to find out if this has ever been recast as a quad, because that's what it is aspiring towards.","rajendra82","Dec 29, 2012"

This beer had good drinkability, it was pretty smooth, the alcohol was hidden well and the flavors did a good job at holding my attention, I could see drinking a few of these when in the mood, but the sweetness might become too much after that. What I liked the most about this beer was how well rounded it was and how complex the aroma was those seemed to be highlights of this beer, I also really like the heavy banana aspect to this beer. There wasn't really anything that I really didn't like about this beer but the sweetness did seem to get a little out of hand in the aroma, but I guess that wasn't that big of a deal. I would buy this beer again, in fact I can see another six pack in the near future to keep on hand for when people come over for the holidays, I recommend this beer to just about anyone. All in all this was a pretty enjoyable beer, I really enjoyed the banana aspect of this beer and it reminded me of one of my favorite Wiezenbocks, it almost tasted like a lighter version of it. Good job New Belgium, this is up there as one of the better brews I have had from them, keep up the good work guys.","StoutHunter","Dec 06, 2012"

Color was a deep coppery-amber with NE-quality clarity and loads of CO2 bubbles in evidence. Nose was earthy, with scents of dark dried fruits accompanied by root and leafy vegetables. Do people still have root cellars? It reminded me of my paternal grandmother's basement. Mouthfeel was medium-to-full, approaching a creaminess that it did not quite achieve. The initial sip was quite hot, making me wish that I had let this continue to age. Once I got past that, it tasted very much like dried dark fruits - prunes, raisins, blackberries, black raspberries. My grandmother was one of the last people I knew that did home canning and this could have been a liquid version of any of her fruit preserves, Finish was semi-sweet with the yeast taking a lot of the sugar out of the equation.

Slight earthy bitterness in the finish. Low to medium carbonation with a full body, and slightly oily mouthfeel.

4.25,6,4.5,4.5,4,4,4.5,"O - With a brewery name like New Belgium, a Belgian-influenced beer should be no surprise. Abbey from New Belgium takes the already potent, complex Belgian yeasts and makes them explode in this beer, filling the senses with deep esters of fruit and earthiness that pairs well with the sweet malt and mildly earthy hops. This beer's strength, both in alcohol and flavor, pushes it towards being a cooler-weather sipper.","BeerFMAndy","Aug 12, 2012"

Head retention is just OK, and lacing is har to come by. The nose has a nice balance between esters and phenols. Lots of banana, plum, and fig are the primary aromas, but there's a healthy undercurrent of spice and clove. The whole thing could stand to jump out of the glass a little bit more though. The flavor profile isn't as well balanced. Especially on the colder side, the beer's a bit of a phenolic mess, with very little else coming through. As the beer warms a bit though, the more fruity aspects of the beer start to take on more prominence. The beer still tastes a little bit too heavily of pepper and clove for my taste, but it's definitely better. The body is solidly lightweight, but the carbonation doesn't have the liveliness of the best Belgian style brews. New Belgium's Abbey Ale is an alright take on a dubbel, but it's not one of my favorites.","axeman9182","Jul 12, 2012"

Not too shabby, If I have to criticize something it would be that there is not quite enough emphasis on yeastiness, spiciness, or tangy Belgo-funk flavors and aromas, especially compared to how much care and attention all the other aspects of this brew have obviously been assembled with. Other than that detail, this brew is pretty amazing!","WastingFreetime","Jan 18, 2012"

Alcohol becomes present in the taste as the beer warms. Mouthfeel is heavy, slight carbonation. Overall, an approachable dubbel.

At around $1.50 a bottle from the store, it packs an enormous amount of drinkability. My only complaint is that I wished that it came in bottles smaller than 12 ounces.

A bit peppery pungent aroma when opened, no noticable ""hoppiness""; this brief odor must have been due to the type of yeast... Not what I was expecting for an ""ale"" at all, the taste was softer, biscuity, slightly sweet...not malty at all in the sense of stout, and absolutely none of the citrus frequent in hefweizens, but very smooth and creamy, due to the persistent foaminess, with lightly spiceyness. A bit similar to Mothership Witbeer, but none of the fruitiness of some hefweizens. Perhaps a little banana esther detectable. A sweeter, moderate weight, savorable beer. Much better than I expected compared to some light, mineral British ales. Probably comparable to an imperial ale, and desireable now that the prices of those have risen.

The aroma primarily features a yeasty earthiness, but there is also a dull, musty hop presence and a bit of brown sugar sweetness. The flavor is satisfying but muddled, with a primary characteristic of caramelized bananas, along with a bid of earthiness and a faint sugary sweetness. The micro-fine carbonation is a bit prickly, but the overall texture is actually quite creamy.

Perhaps a bit more burnt than I would like, but nice. Taste is also strong with similar notes to the aroma, but the burntness is toned down. Mouthfeel is pretty much spot on with ample carbonation.

The taste follows pretty closely, with the additions of black pepper, red grapes (very red wine-y thing goin' on here), and a touch of darkly-toasted rye bread. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a lightly syrupy feel. Overall, a pretty nice dubbel, though it doesn't warm all too well.

Toffee with an almost rum like molasses being most prevelent. Just barely taste and feel the alcholol as well. That surprised me a bit at 7% I figured it would be hidden fairly well.

Literally, when I skip the chocolate cake I treat myself by pulling out the Leffe glass I brought back from Belgium and pour in the deep dark elixir brewed in Ft. Collins.

A sweet malty backbone, slightly biscuity mixed with tropical punch. The fruitiness is still present in the taste but takes on more of a malty, licorice flavor rather than the fruit punch in the nose (no pun intended). No real hops to speak of, this one is slightly sweet from start to finish. The alcohol is covered well, only a slight mouth warming sensation is present.

Some banana aand clove are present in the nose, and smells almost like sugary dark Belgian wit with hints of chocolate. Taste has that familiar New Belgium toasty maltiness. They must have used copious amounts of biscuit malt in this one, as it tastes almost like a richer version of Fat Tire, only fermented with Belgian yeast, which gives it a fruity, spicy, herbal flavor with hints of bubble gum and apple. Very nice, I might say, particularly well-balanced between the sweetness of the malt, the fruitiness of the yeast, and lightly bitter, herbal hoppiness.

A decent flavor, just not that much of it, which is the problem with dubbels in my opinion, but this is a good interpretation of the style.

The beer had a nice creamy taste up front that slowly fades to a clean, hoppy freshness with a touch of citrus.

Frothy three-quarter inch head dissipated into a thin consistent skim of foam; presence of spotty lacing during the tasting. Aromas of yeast, sugar, dark fruit (plum and raisin) and banana. Taste similar to nose but also detected a bit of the bubblegum flavor noted in an earlier review. Also a mild peppery character expressed at the finish.

Smooth and even. You get that slightly sweet edge that comes and goes with the rolling of the flavors. Overall a very good brew I think. Recently I was getting so irritated at the lack of interesting stuff from NB that I was about to just write the whole brewery off. But this one is redemption in a bottle. Damn good.

The medium bodied flavor is heavily malty with a fairly high sweetness as well. There is also a funky flavor in the background I can't put my finger on. Overall, i'm not crazy about this beer.

3.98,-0.7,4.5,4,4,3.5,4,"My first beer from New Belgium in several months, I brought this bottle of Abbey Belgian Style Ale back from my holiday visit to Omaha. Stamped Best Before 20APR07, and poured into my lovely new New Belgium Brewing Company .4 litre globe. A massive, thick and creamy, initially noisy but settling quickly and holding, ecru head sits atop a glowing bronze body with two lonely but persistent streams of carbonation. Candy, fruit, and phenols take up most of the nose space with overripe muskmelon, date sugar, molassess, and a soft and demure rubber scent predominating the overall aroma. A bit of clove and anise are also detectable. The flavor is understated, especially given the rather forceful nose. There are clove, nutmeg, and anise notes that punctuate a largely dark Karo syrup and caramel flavor profile. Fruitcake batter without the chunks of dried maraschino cherries. Slightly peppery mouthfeel with a smooth, full, and creamy swallow. Hangs just a bit heavy on the palate, but generally comes across as medium-bodied. For a U.S.-brewed dubbel, one could certainly do worse than NB Abbey. It's not as complex or interesting as other domestic interpretations of the style, but it remains true to the spirit of dark Belgian ales and stands as a strong, quaffable, qualilty beer. Recommended, especially when fresh.","orfeu","Jan 12, 2007"

A little bit of yeast aroma pops through as well. Dark, ripe fruit flavor rules here and blends in with a bready, Fat Tire-like malt. Spices run rampent and are joined by orange flavor. Belgian sugar forms a nice backbone here and works well in tandem with the malt. Finish introduces a dry, almost burnt fruit flavor.

The aroma offers dark fruit (sweet dark raisins, juicy red wine), candy, light caramel malt and a subtle spiciness. It's smooth across the palate with a light-medium body and exceptionally fine-bubbled carbonation that's mildly effervescent but does no more that caress the tongue. The flavor follows the suggestions of the aroma with some additional candyish sugariness, some more fruit, some leafy hops, and a stabilizing back-bone of bitterness. It's well balanced and although the alcohol is noticeable, it actually acts as part of the flavor profile and isn't offensive at all.

Smells of yeast and caramel, with some artificial-smelling fruity hints like bruised apple and pear. The taste just doesn't cut it for a Belgian-style dubbel. A bit of frutiness, alcohol is noticable, much caramel and a bit of phenolic acidity. In almost all New Belgian ales, I find there is a ""artificial flavor added"" taste to them. That may or may not be the case, but I feel like they add coloring and flavor to some of their ales. The mouthfeel of this ale is oily and plain flat.

Not much dissipation here on this one from the head at first, but it then starts to settle. Plums, raisins, and sugary malts come out of this one in aroma. Maybe even some cherries or grapes come through, as well as a little nutmeg, but most of the aroma is fruit malts. A slight twang of alcohol clears my sinuses a slight bit as well. The smell doesn't exaclty match the taste in this one though. The fruitiness that I smelled is much more mild on the sip. The spice comes through a bit more on taste, as well as some of the fruit. Also, some wheat flavors come through. No real hops at all, and the alcohol burns a little on the swallow. Full-bodied, not too much carbonation (which actually you feel more on the sides of your tongue), and this beer creates a bit of a puckering effect (you can feel it in your jaw).

No change in the dark brown, chestnut-y color. The flavor has smoothed out even more so than when new. Of any of the original flavors, the chocolate and smokiness has come to the forefront and the banana, fruitiness has fallen off and/or mellowed out. Carbonation all but disappeared. I have to give a five for the drinkability as I couldn't stop sipping the damn thing - and then it was gone before I knew it... Five more sit in my closet. I'll try another next year and follow up.","pnkermiz","Jul 02, 2004"

Aroma at first is a huge whiff of alcohol that clears away to reveal some apple and strong fruity smells as well. Alcohol taste was at the forefront, which mellowed out to a smoother somewhat fruity middle and a warm, alcohol aftertaste. I had a bit of trouble truly enjoying the flavors here - the alcohol taste was much too strong, and the unbalance here overpowered any other flavor nuances that may have been present. I found the flavor to be less than the aroma indicated. Good mouthfeel, medium body. This dubbel was pleasant, but rather docile as far as flavor goes. I have been far more impressed by other dubbels.","BrewMan82","May 02, 2004"

The retention is quite impressive, I've been letting it sit and warm for a long while and the head hasn't shown any signs of dying down in the least. This is a hugely aromatic beer, many fruity aromas are present. Very spicy dried fruit smell that contains hints of raisin, fig, berries, and even some nutty character, as well as evidence of the yeast. More of the same sharp, spicy fruit on the palate. Finishes with some bitterness and a malt presence in the background. Yeast is again present, and rounds everything off well. I love spicy beers, and the particular spicy dried fruit character of this dubbel really hits the spot for me. It's a unique dubbel. New Belgium's brews are exceptional and impressive, and very affordable compared to the imports and even most better American craft brews.

It began yeasty, clovey, with grapefruit and later included apples and hints of cinnamon. The aroma was complex enough to make me assume the taste would be more like an actual Abbey ale. However, the taste was actually mellower than anticipated. It was caramelly, and citrusy with a little sweetness and traces of alcohol. The finish was smooth,dry and clovey with a lingering clove aftertaste. Now I don't really like a lot of Abbey ales because the yeasty, mediciney, and citrusy taste can be overpowering. This New Belgium version was just right for my taste buds. Another good point is the bottle is dated.","genaro","Jan 25, 2004"

A smell over-ripe bananas and rum take over where the others fade. The medium biscuity malt body houses flavors of toffee, candy sugar, hint bananas and tobacco. The hops are mainly of the peppery variety with a bit of citrusy and orange zest. A light medicinal astringency peeks through as it warms. The fine effervescence lasts.

The aroma was fruity and of sweet malt. The taste was also of sweet dark fruit like plum and raisin. Hints of spice, sugars and alcohol can be noticed.

Flavor is an scintillating concoction of sweet malt, subdued fruit and a zesty, citrus rind character finish on which I can't put my finger. Mouthfeel is fairly full and creamy, although the mildly watery finish keeps it from scoring higher. A very drinkable dubbel this is, the 7% abv is hard to detect.

In general, it has a mild, yet interesting flavor. This doesn't seem like a lot of beer after you've finished the first bottle, but its relatively high alcohol content of 7% would probably catch up to you if used throughout an evening.

The malts dominate the taste which is well balanced with the sweetness. Very smooth mouthfeel and easy to drink.

3.6,-10.2,4,4,3,4,4,"Chestnut colored with a nice amount of thick tan head.  Belgian yeast aromas are evident from the start and continue into the mouth.  I found this to be a relatively bland and subdued version of a dubbel, but nothing was truly off, just toned down.","jreitman","Aug 11, 2002"

4.08,1.7,4.5,4,4,4.5,4,"A sediment packed mahogany presentation.  Alcohals, paradise grains, clove, and bananas on the palate.  Thinner bodied than the titan 'Ommegang - Ommegang'.  Also a flavor that is not as enduring, but this is a good brew none the less.","Jordan","Jul 10, 2002"
4.42,10.2,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Big tan head, deep mahogany color.  Spicy nose, alcohol warming hints.  Figgish flavor with very dry finish.  Substantial hop bite balances alongside a yeasty flavor.  Very pleasant as it warms and the bitterness subsides.  Some fruity, spicy flavors balance with dark malt.  Very complex and a great offering from NB.","Andy","May 09, 2002"
3.97,-1,3.5,4,4,4,4,"At first, I was ready to criticize this beer for being too ""clean"" and a little thin.  But as the beer warmed, and especially after a dose of yeast, the complexities really began to come out.  A solid Abbey, not as ""rustic"" as our East Coast version, Allagash Double.(That's not a criticism, just a comparison)","pbrian","Apr 30, 2002"

3.15,-21.4,3.5,3.5,3,3,3,"Spicy, with a very pronounced yeast presence.  Pours out to a very dark ruby color.  Definetely gets better as it warms.  Very good, but not outstanding.  I would've preferred just a little sweetness to balance out the spiciness.  Thanks to jaybeerman for sending this my way.","proc","Apr 21, 2002"
3.4,-15.2,4,4,3,4,3,"Hazy light brown in color, with an attractive and persistent one centimeter head when poured into a tulip glass.  Huge bubblegum esters dominate the aroma, but slight green apple acetaldehyde is in the background.  Fruity Belgian yeast contibutions comprise the forefront of NB Abbey's taste-- Banana and bubblegum borderline on being overbearing, but thankfully are ensued by a pleasant slightly roasted and raisinlike Special B (dark Belgian caramel malt) flavor.  It's medium bodied and the smooth mouthfeel helps accentuate the subtle caramel flavors.  It finishes slightly sweet w/ Special B burnt toffee flavors on the tongue.  Although this is certainly a flavorful brew, it lacks the complex Belgian yeasty notes that are integral to a Dubbel.  It was a bit too clean to balance the very strong bubblegum and banana flavors.  There's nothing offputting about this beer, however.","marc77","Apr 01, 2002"
