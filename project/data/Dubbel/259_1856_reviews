"O – Very good aroma and flavor, and very mild in all aspects.  Mouthfeel is the best part.  A solid dubbel."

"Has anyone not had this?"
""
""
""
"Just OK.  Not a standout for the style"
""
"Final Thoughts: All in all, a solid and well made Dubbel that might have gotten off to a bit of a rocky start, but to me, makes up for it where it counts. For some reason I can't help but think it would go well with fish. Thumbs up."

"Overall /  Drinkability:  Very nice and very drinkable - one of the hits of the tasting event that was held and if others hadn't tapped this bottle so quickly, I think I could have finished most of it myself.  Full of flavor but not so strong that you'll regret having a whole bottle to yourself.  I think this would have paired well with a wide range of food as well.  I'll have to pick this up again and savor it some more."
""
""
"Overall - Delicious and a great dubbel, and possibly the best I've had for the style. The Prior 8 by St. Bernardus was very good but to me this is even better."
""
""
"Sweet hoppy flavor but not a palette killer."
""
""
"Malty and yeasty with candy sugar sweetness, alcohol-soaked dark fruits and an alcohol warmth.  Moderate-heavy carbonation makes this on the drier side and keeps the body light enough to not feel syrupy.  Earthy chocolate malt"
""
""
""
"Can't believe I've never tried this.  11.2oz bottle served in a St. Bernardus chalice.    08 12 15 printed on the back label.  Pours with a dense, rocky, two inch, cream-colored head pockmarked with tiny craters.  Head eventually settles into a solid, quarter inch cap.  Delicate webs of lacing are present adhering to the walls of the glass.  Color is a deep mahogany brown with a slightly hazy clarity.  Great nose - figgy, pruney and bready with a suggestion of Belgian yeast.  Taste follows nose, but a bit dull - less fruit and more bread and yeast.  There's also a faint metallic quality the presents at the finish.  Mouthfeel is light-medium in body with an easy, even carbonation.  Overall, a solid representation of the style but the flavor is fairly lackluster.  I'll need to revisit with a fresher bottle in the future."

"O: Very good, very typical abbey dubbel."
"Final Grade: 4.4, a superb A-grade. St. Bernardus Pater 6 is an excellent brew that all fans of Trappist-style ales should consider well worth a try. Nothing specific about this beer's flavour profile jumps out at me - instead, everything blends beautifully into a harmonious whole; one that can seem deceptively straightforward at first. However, it opens up as the glass warms, and reveals itself to be the upper-tier dubbel that it  most assuredly is. Great stuff; I've never seen this available in single format locally, but it would quickly become a go-to dubbel if that were to change."
""
""
"Overall: a very pleasant dubbel, easily enjoyed with mild cheeses and less fatty cuts of meat. A solid beer and one I would enjoy again"
""
""
"O: A very complex flavor profile with a very well hidden alcohol making it easy to drink and it is interesting enough to want to have over and over again."
""
""
""
""
"Very good beer.. My first time trying this. I was not disappointed.. The feel was the only downfall.. Very carbonated.. Other than that I can't find any fault with this beer! Very nice Belgian taste!"
""

"Already wishing I'd purchased more than one of these packs, especially, since it is now unavailable in my immediate area."

"Little brother to the Abt 12, but much harder to find in the US. Very tasty for its ABV, but left me wanting the 12."
""
""
""
""
"Enjoy"
"Pours a deep murky brown with about one finger of off-white head. The head settles down to a thin cap that lasts well into the beer. The aroma is mild, with both sweet malt and spice like a Christmas bread but without the nutmeg or cinnamon. Savory. The taste is similar but a little subdued. The body is lighter and lacking in the unctuousness of others dubbels. This is a good beer but not my favorite for the style."

"o: an excellent beer.  sweet and loaded with flavour, but has an ample amount of bitterness after each sip"
""
""
"A very well rounded Dubbel, no shortage of yeasty spice and complexity here, a hefty flavour profile that has a strong malt and caramel profile but also plays well to the yeast. Delightful beer, well balanced and quite approachable, quite a peppery dubbel and one I will look forward to having again."

"Pater 6 pours a cloudy amber color with no head. There is a very dry and very sweet aroma, with some dry grape almost wine like notes. The taste is dry and very very sweet, with some grape notes, and has a wine like flavor. The flavors are good and strong, but very flat feel. Overall its nice, but very very sweet, and too sweet for me."
""
"This tasted pretty decadent until the terminal sourness rolled in. After that, it was a literal bad taste in the mouth."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall – Tastes like a lighter version of the ABT 12. A little dry tasting and none of the flavours are very pronounced. Very drinkable though, just a little subdued - which is I'm sure what they're going for here."
""
""
""
""

"High quality product from St.B."

"Bottle from a mixed six-pack poured into a goblet. A very dark cloudy cola brown brew with a large beige head comprised of fairly large bubbles, I do get a rather fruity and spicy aroma here, tons of banana and fresh berries along with some clove, chocolate, and toffee notes. Palate follows suit, although I found the proceedings to be more dry and woody than the sweet nose might suggest. Banana and blackberry initially, and then some lemony hops become apparent earlier than expected. Tons of spice, clove, cinnamon, and black pepper, with just a little faint grape candy and molasses to finish. Not particularly sweet. Aggressive phenols carry through right to the end. The alcohol peeks through from time to time and I am feeling that the heavy carbonation might be muting and blending the flavor components together. Somewhere in here there are Scottish-like malts, fruity esters, and leafy hops all trying to rise above. Enjoyable enough for the spice and wonderful aroma. Very different from its stablemate Prior 8, which is smoother, more coconut and chocolate in character, and less boldly spicy."
""
""
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel is of high carbonation, the end is quite dry."
""
""
""
"For a Dubbel it drinks surprisingly well, and has a nice subtle quality for easy drinking. Not a big sugar bomb either, quietly stated very nice."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - On its own merits this is a very good beer. Unfortunately, I can't help but compare it to the Pater 8, and I would select the 8 10 out of 10 times ahead of this one."
""
""
""
""
"D- Very drinkable. The high carbonation detracts a little for me but i'm sure it is good with some age on it."
""
""
"Classic example of the style, a really pleasant and balanced Dubbel. It was definitely worth it to keep it in storage for a couple of years."

"*Riff on Campbell's Chunky. No thievery intended; credit where due."

""
"MF – Medium bodied, dry finish, a bit metallic in the finish, well carbonated giving a little sharpness on the palate. 3"
""
"O-Overall a very enjoyable beer which I could drink over and over."
""
"Delicious and rich, malty, ripe figs, nice smooth finish.  No acute sweetness, did I mention delicious? Really well done, you can tell the brewmasters are keen on quality.  had one these for the last eight years and i have never been disappointed. An everyday Belgian no matter what season of the year."
""
"Overall, an exceptional example of the style. It has that nice marriage of malty flavors, dark fruits, and that distinctive puff pastry flavor characteristic of Belgian yeast. I generally reach for Quads instead of Dubbels, but I'm very glad I finally got around to trying this beer. It is outstanding."
""
""
""
""
"O - solid, well made, true to style and very drinkable."
"O: As I said before, it's one of the better dubbels I've tried. That's not saying much, but it is good and well worth a try. Recommended."
""
""
"Overall a good dubbel, kind of toned down in the dark fruits. I'd drink this one again."

"Os grandes rótulos costumam ter seus primos mais pobres, porém de qualidade e respeito. A St. Bernardus 6 está um pouco longe dos carros chefes da cervejaria, mas mesmo assim merece respeito. É um cerveja agradável e de qualidade. Antes de tudo, uma St. Bernardus."
""
""
""
""
""
"Muddy auburn beer, large white head. Aroma is sweet and fragrant with a touch of buttery bread, prunes, grapes, a liiitle bit of cinnamon, almond, light cocoa, melty caramel, and earthy flowers. Taste is spicy, recognizable St. Bernadus yeast, caramel, dark fruit, and nutmeg. This is an excellent beer however it seems to be a mellow version of the style."
"O-easy drinking and good blend of flavors, enjoyable"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured into a goblet thick white foam over a cloudy brown; it faded into spotty lacing. Smells of fruit and alcohol spice and toasted bread. Tastes slightly of coffee, rye bread, chocolate, alcohol and yeast. It's slightly watery and dry, which takes down on its drinkability."
"Overall, love it, because of that Belgium yeast taste- hard to describe for me, but I really like them lately"
"O: Easily the best dubbel I've ever had. Very crisp, very refreshing. Most dubbels I find to be very bland and one dimensional. This is a great departure."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: St. Bernardus never disappoints, and this is no exception. Excellent example of a dubbel."
""
""
"Overall, my 2nd Bernardus brew, I don't care for them. Their yeast profile, probably fermented at higher temps. Whatever it is I dont care for it"
"Very drinkable. Layered flavors that transition. Very good."

"Serving was ~12 oz bottle poured into a goblet. The pour formed a thin slightly off-white head into a hazy brownish amber color. The smell had notes of raisins, plums and caramel. It had a delicious aroma. The taste followed the smell and had notes of caramel and raisins. It had a very smooth mouth feel. Overall, a solid dubbel."
""
""
""
"A very good dubbel, indeed. A good cold weather beer that keeps drinking momentum and doesn't infringe on further imbibing."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- Solid beer but not nearly as good as Westmalle Dubbel. Westmalle Dubbel has quickly become the dubbel by which I judge all others. Still, worth a try. A definite must for clove lovers."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- outstanding beer. Enjoyed this beer look forward to the next one"
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is very nice brown ale. Great brewery. If both were equally available, would I take this over a Leffe Bruin, no, but a fine beer all the same."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: As solid as a dubbel it gets. This brewery can't do anything wrong. Another great beer to add to the lineup."
"O: A very good dubbel. Sort of on the lighter side for the style, but full of complexity. Very much a little brother to the famed Abt 12."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The taste was nice and sweet thanks to all those recognizable Belgian characteristics and it finished with a low to moderate bite. Just another fine example of the style."

"Pours a dark cloudy brown with a medium tan head, which slowly fades to a razor thin head that lasts through out with some light lacing. Aroma of rich roasted caramel malt, gark fruits, some Belgian yeast with bready notes. Taste same as aroma with some mild bitter notes and light nutty flavor. Palate is a medium body, a balanced sweet nutty bitter smooth mouth feel, with good lively carbonation. Finish is a nice rich roasted nutty caramel malt with some mild bitter notes, yeasty, bready nutty lingering flavor. Overall a very good, flavorful and enjoyable ale"

"O: good complexity, good flavors, solid balance and very enjoyable. very smooth and easy to drink. a fantastic Dubbel"
"To the Point: a nice Pater, pleasing to drink, easy to enjoy, I think I like this better than the Prior 8 which has a cinnamon raisin bread likeness;"
""
""
"D - high not as good as the 8"
""
""
""
""
""

"O: Complex and perfectly balanced. I gotta say I love it and want some more of it. The balance is what really shines here. Not over barring in any way but just nicely married. Cheers!"

"Bottle 330ml. Pours beautifull brown/deep with creamy beige head. Aroma is of malt, caramel, citrus, sweetness. Taste is of malt, medium sweet, caramel, citrus, hops, belgian yeast and a rather long dry and slightly bitter agreable finish. Palate: Medium body, average carbonation. Overall: Very good, tasty. Interesting body and balance. A serious beer, with a reasonnable abv."
""
""
""
""
""
"Drinks easily and has a well masked alcohol content. Complex and well made, but lacks body and the overall flavor is just a bit light to take the score down a bit."
""
""
""
""
"not a huge fan of this style, but i appreciate it for what it is. a nice sweet malty profile with a nice spicy finish."

""

""
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall, this is one of the most unique dubbels a person can find. Typical dubbels have the ever-so cloying attributes of intense maltiness and bananas; pater 6 is a pseudo-antithesis to the aforementioned. You don't have to agree with the profile that has been given to this beer, but I have led many beer tastings with this as the dubbel of choice (sometimes) and no one has ever asked for their dos Equis amber ale back."
""
""
""
""
""
"Beer is medium-light in body, with carbonation of fairly high intensity, resulting in a beer that is fizzy at first, eventually creating a mass of foamy bubbles upon the palate. Closes semi-dry, with moderate stickiness lingering across the palate."
""
""
""
"Overall, I am not very impressed by this Dubbel. It really lacks complexity and depth of flavor along with a weak mouthfeel. I feel like this could be a whole lot better with a little bit of work."
"It's an ok beer."
"jd"
""
"Solid dubbel, nice balance of sweetness, earthiness, and bitterness, although I think it may slightly be overrated. I prefer the Prior 8 by a few miles over this one, so if you're ever in a pickle between the two, go for the 8. This is still a nice brew to try once, though, and the lighter ABV tax is nice."
""
""
""

"O- Good beer, good flavors, strong dubbel."
"This isn't a master piece like their 12 or the tripel, but this a very nice beer. If the price weren't near 20 a 4 pack on this 6.7% beer I might grab one from time to time."
""
"O-This beer is unmistakably (and deliciously) Belgian. The sweet flavors are indeed sweet and there are fruit components, but it doesn't hit you over the head like a lot of the stronger-flavored American interpretations of a dubbel. A fine example of restraint in beer-making."
"	Overall Impression: it’s a good beer, but quite a shock at first taste, my nose and my tongue went in opposite directions; it’s a good, solid brew but one of the weaker Belgians (especially considering the St. Bernardus Abt 12!); it was fun to try, but to honest, I doubt I would ever buy it again"
"O - A flavorful, balanced dubbel. Easy to drink. A little bit lighter body compared to the ""8" but it holds its own. Great brew."
""
"Overall, another truly great beer from St. Bernardus, I love it. Its a lighter and fruiter version of the style and a must try."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A very good Belgian Dubbel. Solid balance of complex fruit esters and spice."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pater 6 showcases Christmas spices and sugary, bready malts. There's also plenty of fruit esters as well. Excellent mix of flavors that really hit the spot around Christmas time."
""
""
""
"D - Undeniably Belgian... A bit of a let down compared to this Abbey's other high profile offerings... Excellent appearance and solid aroma, but a bit of a disappointment otherwise... I would gladly drink again, but would suggest others gravitate towards other examples of the style and from the brewery... The best facet of this beer is that drinkability in that the sub 7% ABV in this style is a rarity..."
""
""
"This is a medium to lighter bodied brew with a moderate amount of carbonation. It is light and refreshing with a crisp finish. The aromatics and flavors integrate well with each other and formulate a brew that is complex enough to nitpick but very easy to drink as well. This is worth seeking out."
""
""
""
"overall, this is another excellent beverage in the world of beer and i would direly hope to visit these breweries some day. this one is more of the belgian candied sugar, fruitier type than the 8, and much richer, but it's still a great drink."
""
""
"O - Overall, this beer was all over the place. Beautiful appearance, lacking smell, okay flavor, good body. I guess really it all depends on what you think."
""
""
"O - A few things going on in here but it takes to much effort for me to fork it all out. Dry finishes such as these are always a turn off. I would be content never having another one."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Final Thoughts: A decent beer, one of the better Dubbel's I've had. Any fan of Belgian beer would appreciate this one. Would I drink it again? Maybe, for now I'm looking forward to trying their 8, Tripel, and 12."
"O- very drinkable Dubbel, but not quite as much dark fruit as one would expect from the style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a murky brown with a foamy khaki head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Foamy swaths of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, brown sugar, spices, and dark fruits - especially grapes and raisins. Taste is much the same with a slight tartness and a fruity finish. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer that is tasty but I think it smells better."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, I really enjoy this beer. Very different from their other products. Will buy again."
""
"If only those malts weren't so oxidized / simplified.... Having had both this bottle and a fresh bottle, I can see that my target zone is definitely in between these two profiles, and next time I acquire this particular beer I will be aiming for aging it for around 8 months at basement temp or 12-14 months in a refrigerator."
"O: While I don't like this as much as St. Bernardus' 8 or 12, it's still a fine beer with an interesting flavor."
""
"pour is dark chestnut brown with a tan fluffy head. Nose is heavy sweet malt, candies sugar, dark fruits, lightly green. Taste offers well balanced sweetness, notes of nuttiness, and dark fruits aplenty. Body is a touch thin with heavy carbonation and a soft feel."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Had this from the bottle along with all the other St. Bernarduses in one weekend to compare. Pours a medium brown color, purple haze in there, with a fluffy white head. Aroma of some dark fruits, yeasty spice, rather subdued. Flavor follows with a nice smooth plum and fig, bit of apple and pear, and some yeasty spices going on. Relatively light on the palate, not dry, but plenty of carbonation. A little pricey for what it is, but a very nice brew."
""
""
"St. Bernardus Pater 6 pours a rusted copper color, lightening a bit at the edges. There's two fingers of bone colored head crowning the beer. It manages to stick around for a minute or to before fading, but does so relatively cleanly. The nose has a strong fig presence, as well as a gentle alcohol aroma. The flavor profile flashes some phenols with a clove taste right out front. The same esters and booze from the nose then come in, though they're joined here by a subtle bready maltiness. I wish there was more variety to the fruity flavors rather than just fig, but the alcohol presence remains restrained and pleasantly warming. The mouthfeel is very nice, on the dry side body-wise and paired with a nice and lively carbonation. St Bernardus's Pater 6 is a decent enough dubbel, but I think it's also clearly a step below some of the great trappist takes on the style."
"Poured from the bottle into my St. Bernardus goblet. Huge head forms quickly and stays around for a while. Was nice and thick too, almost like whipped cream. Really nice looking in the glass. Dark chestnut brown body. Smell was a combo of ripe bananas and cloves. Taste was spot on for a dubbel: brown sugar, caramel, cherry. One thing I would have liked more is a slightly more hefty body on this one; it bordered on the thin side. Easy and smooth to drink. Looking forward to the other three styles that came in my gift pack."

"On tap at World of Beer- Savannah. Poured into a pint glass with a nice deep brown/amber hue and generous beige 2 finger head that hung around a bit. Smell is of dark fruits (figs, raisins) and some carmel and spice. A bit bready as well. Tates is exact to the nose with a nice subtle hop finish. Similar to the 12 with the smooth/balanced finish. The monks are doing it right! Love the fruit/bread on the front end. Exceptional taste. Feel is nice for the style. A good bit of carbonation and silk to it. Overall- A great brew that is very smooth and complex. Nice combination of malts, spices, fruits and hops. A must have-"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A solid dubbel, but I'm partial to the Prior 8."
"Are there happier monks-- or are there happier *beer-label monks*-- than those that brew St. Bernardus? The 6 is another family favorite; a classic dubbel that is yeasty and fruity, not overly gassy and merely subtly hopped at the very end of each sip. You will find it difficult to do better, and not just at this affordable price."
""
""
""
"O: a must-try Belgian: a rich, unique and complex dubbel meant to be slowly sipped and savored, resulting in different nuances noticed on every sip."
""
""
""
"Pours a murky brown amber with massive head leaving light lacing. Over carbonated and foamed out of the bottle. Light malt, light fruits, slight sour and cola notes to aroma. Taste is dark and light fruits, light sweet malt. Pleasant mild malt and fruit finish. Tastes tame compared to the bigger St. Bernardus ales. Light to medium bodied. I'd choose those stronger ones over this, but it is a pleasure to drink."
""
""
"330 ml bottle into signature chalice, best by 7/22/2013. Pours lightly hazy reddish brown color with a nice 1-2 finger dense cream colored head with good retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Some nice spotty lacing clings to the glass, with some carbonation streaming up. Aromas of big raisin, prune, fig, apple, caramel, banana, molasses, clove, herbal, earth, bread, and yeast spices. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity. Taste of big raisin, caramel, prune, molasses, pepper, bread, toast, banana, earth, herbal, and yeast spiciness. Light fruity tartness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark fruit, caramel, molasses, bread, toast, earth, banana, and yeast spices on the finish for a good bit. Nice flavor balance and complexity; with no cloying sweetness. Medium carbonation and body; with a fairly creamy and slightly slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice dubbel. Nice flavor complexity and balance; and very smooth to drink. Really enjoyable."
"Overall an extremely tasty and very easy to drink Dubbel, and is a brew that hides all notion of somewhat moderate ABV..."
""
""
"O: Very good"
""
""
""
""
""

"For not really caring for many Dubbels (especially American made ones), this was really exceptional. The flavors were well balanced, flavorful and the body was easy drinking. I'd happily have another anytime."

"O: Its a lesser ABT12; But simply amazing. Step down from abt 12 but much appreciated beer. Better then most. deff would recommend."
"This beer is ideal as a before meal apertif to get the stomach growling. It's gives a low alcohol taste in the mouth. I wouldn't drink with my meal and i wouldn't go looking for it on a special occasion, but it's nice to start out the evening tasting if its on the menu."
"Bright effervescence breaks up the medium sized body. Teeth sticking sweetness, alcohol soaked cherries, belgian candy sugar, juicy raisins, all rounded out with bread crusts on the sides of the tongue. Carbonation and alcohol presence clears the palate preventing the beer from being cloying along with a touch of yeast bite. Very drinkable for it's complexity. Bready character comes out a bit more as the beer warms which is nice as it really rounds the beer out and balances it. Makes it almost like a meal (as it should be i guess) an awesome representation of the style."
"Overall, a fantastic beer, and what I expect from the great Belgian brewers."
"O: A few steps beneath an abt 12, but still superior to many beers."
"O: very good beer; taste's pretty good smells even better"
""
""
""
""
"O: Good beer and reasonably drinkable."
"I'll be looking for this in the stores where I'm sure the price won't be as prohibitive as the price in the bars."
""

""
""
"Overall, a nice beer, but not the equal of its stablemates."
""
""
""

"Strong B to B+"
"This is a very good beer. I can see this with some applewood smoked BBQ pork."
""
""
"A top-notch dubbel. Rich and sweet with great spicy flavors."
""
""
"Pours a dark murky orange hue which leaves a two finger head and a nice rim of lacing,the smell is jarrah honey,biscuty malts,floral hops and yeasty bread,the mouthfeel is medium bodied and has tastes very similar to smell with hints of jarrah honey firstly followed by some fruitcake,yeasty bread,raisins,caramel candy and finished with a mix of floral hops and bread pudding and overall its nice and very drinkable cheers."
""
"O: nice dubbel, wish it was a little more spicy. Nice maltiness and excellent body. Definitely worth a try."

"This beer will most likely improve with more oxidation, and become tastier as I near the bottom of the glass, ahem."
"Overall: a very nice dubbel indeed. Besides being tasty, it is eminently drinkable. Possibly the best overall dubbel I've had."
""
"Overall, a great beer and an excellent dubbel. Nice stuff!"
""
""
""
""
"In terms of smell, a sweet roasted malt with some fruit comes through. The taste carries this forward with the addition of something similar to banana. In the mouth, this beer is of medium heaviness with lots of bubbles. Overall, this beer is quite nice, and i was plesantly surprised. Not too heavy and sweet for a dubbel. Quit drinkable and will definetly have again."
"O - excellent. This is a great example of Belgian Dubbel."

"Served in a branded goblet, poured a chestnut colour with a light head. First impressions when served chilled were not impressive, but the flavour developed considerably as it warmed up. A crisp and malty nose, consistent with the flavour, and a slightly buttery finish. A mild spice accompaniment throughout."
""
""
""
"First I should start out with the fact that I initially had no intentions of reviewing this beer. But I poured it into the matching St. Bernadus glass and was immediately captivated by this beers appearance. The color is a dark brown with red/amber tones. Large billowy head fits neatly in the glass. The aroma is typical trappist, but cleaner than most. Malts and dark fruit are there as well. The flavor is amazing. Clean, crisp and dry. Hard to describe but definitively enjoying to. Light bodied and very well carbonated. Overall this was great."
""
"In spite of the less than impressive start, this finishes rather nicely."
""
""
"O- Awesome as expected."
"DOA"
""
"Steely toffee, dried raisin, dark and nutty bread aroma. Taste follows up the steely dark fruit and dark bready nose. Bruised red apples. Sharp, bubbly carbonation cuts through an otherwise plush, creamy mouthfeel. Once the carbonation bubbles itself I find the body much more enjoyable. Idllyic almost."
"A very nice dubbel. Simple yet elegant, with plenty of rummy and sugary flavors to make you want to sip it into the night. A very nice dubbel, worthy of high praise. I could drink this one all night, especially on a cold night, and the medium alcohol lets you do that."

"After trying a few of the St. Bernardus brews, they definitely have me hooked! A fantastic brew and a must try Dubbel to get the true feel of the style!"
""
"cork and cage set up at a bargain price. follows a whole bunch of saisons and farmhouse ales real well in our little tasting here. pours the darkest orange it could possibly be, caramel orange. lively white head in my leffe thick stem glass. smells like a malty belgian and thats it. maybe a gentle cherry apple aroma too, fruity but not fruity at the same time. flavor is just a balanced smooth belgian dubbel. glorious and simple. mouthfeel is magic, smooth and well carbonated with a creamy afterfeel. really nice beer. very drinkable at its tolerable abv, this will go well with the chorizo basil arrabiata sauce which is happening on the stove at the moment..."

"O: excellent beer, stacks up favorably to any dubbel I've had."
""
""
""

"Overall: A very fine brew that made for part of a great after Christmas gift to myself. Very indicative of its awesome brewery."
""
""
""
""
"O - Very solid dubbel all around, and very easy drinking."
""
""
""
"O- decent dubbel, abbey ale. Little dry and the higher carbonation is a slight turn off."
""
""
""
"Overall this is the staple of what a Belgian single ale should be. There is nothing inherently exciting but there is not a single fault I can find in this beer. Perfect starter or afternoon beer when you don't want a really big beer yet, but still satisfies if you want that classic Belgian flavor profile. This should be a year round go to beer for all fans of Belgian brown ales."
""
"Notes: My 3rd St Bernardus so far and it is a runaway winner. The beer seems supremely well made and is great for as much as what it doesn't have as it does; no cloying sweetness, no wallop of Belgian yeast, no overpowering sourness, just a damn fine beer."
"O- This brew will leave you wanting another, fantastic with great balance."
""
""
""
"picked up the st. bernadus gift pack with the matching glass. bottle pours into the snifter a liquid caramel color with a finger's worth of tan head.upon settling to a frothy cap there is little lacing left behind. the smell is that of belgian yeast, brown sugar, dark fruits and malts. taste has all the before mentioned ingredients plus a hint of spice. has a creamy mouthfeel to it. great carbonation and a dry finish. this is a fantastic beer and easy to find. cant believe it took me so long to try it."
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall, this is a beer I strongly endorse and recommend! I will have this beer again when a celebration truly calls for it. This is not a session beer, it is a after-dinner beer."

"Overall I really enjoyed Pater 6. This was my first forray into the St. Bernardus family, and I really enjoyed the experience. This was by far the smoothest and most well-balanced dubbel I've ever tasted. Lots of complex taste, but no one aspect overpowered the others. Can't wait to try the others!"
"Poured from bottle into a St. Bernardus goblet. Dark mahogany color with a very light tan head. Head is about one finger width and dissipates quickly. Smells like very ripe fruit. Plums, and ripe banana. I think the taste follows the smell pretty well on this one. Sweet with very little hoppiness that I can detect. Very smooth and drinkable. Like most Belgian ales, it just gets better and more complex as it warms up."
""
""
""
""
"This gets better and better as you get further into it. The tastes meld wonderfully, and the feel is soft, airy and bubbly, yet with plenty of flavor to give it enough heft to remind you this is a darker beer. According to their website, the water used in their beer comes from a spring 150 meters below the earth, with water that ""scientists have proved"" is derived from rainfall from when Jeanne D'Arc was alive. Definitely give this a try, it has got to be my favorite dubbel thus far."
""

"This beer poured out a strange hazy brown/watered down purple kool-aid color that I have never quite seen before (although the closest colored beer I have drank like this is Trois Pistoles.) The aroma is of sweet caramel malts and figs. The initial flavor is dominated by sweet and earthy tones, then towards the end of the swallow a spicy dryness steps in the the flavor profile. This beer leaves your mouth a little dry and thirsty for another drink with a residual sweetness hanging on your tongue. The level of carbonation seems a bit high for this as well. This is a good solid beer and this is the first time I have had it. It is good to be had and get it off of my BA checklist, but if I ever want another St. Bernardus I much prefer the 12 (the quad-which is easily one of my favorite beers out there.)"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Didn't expect anything less from St. Bernardus. Quality stuff. Only knocks would be a bit watery and the carbonation is a bit high."
"Overall: The carbonation is really the X factor in this beer. The nose and flavor are nice and standard for the style, but the carbonation really explodes on the tongue. I think it takes a little bit away from the experience, but this is still a nice beer."
""
"A very nice Belgian dubbel, granted I haven't had many actually Belgian dubbels. Previously thought I wasn't a huge fan of the style, but I think I have changed my mind. Looking forward to trying a few more from St. Bernardus."
""
"O) Really enjoyed this. I know they are different styles, but I can't help but compare it to the 12, which I liked just a little better. You really can't go wrong with either. The bottom line is St. Bernardus makes some mighty fine brews."
""
""
"Really an excellent beer that I don't think could be improved upon too much. An excellent example of a dubbel and one that should be a benchmark for other dubbels."
""
"I enjoyed it but I really expected more from SB than this. It was too light of body, the nose was too mild and the flavor was interesting but reserved."
""
""
""
"O- I bought a 4 pack with a wine glass that included the 6, 8 and 12 as well as the triple. I was very skeptical about spending 22$ on four beers that I have never had but this beer is amazing and I look forward to testing the others."

"This one's a little one dimensional but good and easily drinkable."
"O: This is a solid, well made, drinkable beer."
"Overall: Quite good and I enjoyed each of the St. Bernardus and would very much consider going to get the 6 pack again."
"O - It's not my favorite dubbel (that honor goes to Westmalle), but it's pretty darn close. It's dangerously tasty- I could drink this every day of the week. The price isn't bad at all, either."
"O - A very nice and complex thirst quencher."
"Pours a hazy, brown with a bright white head. Head diminishes quickly and leaves a thin lacing on the sides of the chalice. Little bits floating around the beer. Smell strong notes of dark fruits, Belgium Yeast, and bread. Very refreshing taste. Taste notes of bread, raisins, plums, and yeast. Very refreshing beer with a very crisp finish. Overall an awesome beer."
"Overall a pleasantly refreshing and easy going drink."
"D - Easily one of the best beers I've had in my life. Extremely easy to drink. Nice, full flavor. Not too sweet, not too bland. The super smooth mouthfeel just puts this one over the top. I know I'll be picking this one up again."
"O: A nice dubbed; missing a little something in the taste, but otherwise very good."
"O- St. Bernardus and Chimay were my introductions into dubbels, and I'm glad that's where I started to get me into the style."
"Enjoyable as all from St. Bernardus."
"O - A very flavoursome and drinkable beer. Delightful."
"Overall: Very good dubbel overall. St. Bernardus makes excellent beers and this one is no exception. I would recommend giving this one a shot."
"Overall a solid flavorful beer."
"This continues to grow on me as I work through the glass. Nicely done."
"Pours a deep brown with a big fizzy head. Smell has some powerful fruit notes. Grapes. Pears. Yeast. Caramel. Spices. Flavor mirrors the smell in this beer. Rich caramel body. Fruit notes in the background. Barnyard yeasty finish. Dull sweetness throughout. Bitey bitterness in the finish also. Medium bodied. Very well carbonated. Somewhat dry finish. Overall a very solid dubbel."
"Medium bodied with a prominent spicy character up front that lingers over the earthy hops, vinous dark fruit and sweet malt into a sweet and slightly dry finish. Hints of pepper, clove and candy sugar as well as a slight syrupy medicinal character. The malt profile s sweet and slightly roasted with lots of caramel and chocolate and complimented by the dark fruit notes. Hints of plum, fig, grape, dark cherry and raisin. Well balanced and very complex. Another really good beer from this excellent brewery."
"This beer poured out as a nice shade of deep orange brown, the head was tan and foamy. The lacing wasn't too bad. The smell of the beer was earthy and had a little spice on the nose followed by some brown sugary sweetness. The taste is of dark fruits and Belgian yeast, a little bit of spice in the aftertaste. The mouthfeel is lightly carbonated and has a gentle soft feel to it. Overall it's a pretty good Dubbel."
"O-its subtle, but it does start to grow on you the more you drink it. compared to other dubbels i've had though, this doesn't quite compare. it is fairly unique though and i do appreciate the lower ABV than many belgians. it just doesn't have the great taste that many belgians do. it is easy drinking though."
"O: one of the best dubbles I think I've ever had and quite possibly too drinkable (should I not have said Drinkable in the Overall section?)"
"The beer pours a dark amber color with a white head. The aroma is a mix of some dark fruit, Belgian candy sugar and caramel malt. The flavor is more of the same. I get some candy sugar and Belgian yeast notes, as well as a little bit of sweet dark fruit - mainly cherries and figs. The alcohol is present but is fairly faint. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. A very nice Belgian dubbel."
"In short: a Dubbel with rich, Doppelbock-resembling malt-qualities."
"Medium to light mouthfeel and very little notice of the alcohol. Very enjoyable brew."
"Poured from a brown 11.2 oz. bottle. Has a cloudy dark brown color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of dark fruits, some spices. Taste is a bit milder than the smell, fruits ar present, as well as alcohol with a touch of spice. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a good quality beer."
" "
"O: The beer is very easy to drink because it’s well balanced and no traces of alcohol are detectable in the taste."
"M: medium body, crispy at the beggining and would say some refreshing"
"Overall - Not that great of a dubbel left my tastebuds wanting something more it smells better than it taste. That said go grab one and see for yourself."
"O. If this is something akin to the beer the monks brew for their daily tipple then these monks are no ascetics. This is a very fine beer and just a little too easy to drink, which is no bad thing except for hole it would make in my wallet."
"To date, St Bernardus Pater 6 is the best Dubble I have had. I can’t wait to try its big brothers, Prior 8 and Abt 12."
"Edit - after a long and arduous quest, I have discovered that this is one of three beers my wife will drink. Success."
"Not my favorite St. Bernardus beer but still good."
"D - Very drinkable and one that I would certainly revisit. I wouldn't say its at the top of its class but definitely a reliable brew."
"M/D: medium-bodied with more than average carbonation. Easy drinking here for a brew that has wide appeal."
"Notes: This beer has wonderful complexity and drinkability."
"Comments-Been trying more dubbels lately and this one would be near the top of the list for me. I much preferred it to St. B's other dubbel(Prior 8)"
"Drinkability: Never doubt the Belgians when it comes to beers (chocolates and fries, too.), especially when beer is involved. This is a very drinkable Trappist Ale and one I would come back to. Excellent!"
"Medium bodied, decent carbonation, and there is a bit of a bitter aftertaste. I think this may be a bad bottle, but I am not positive, and it does not appear to be an old bottle. This beer is disappointing. If I decide to try this again, I will update this review."
"D - Well worth a try"
"Pours a crisp, translucent reddish mahogany with about a finger of head dissipating fairly soon after. Strong aroma of ripe vinous fruits, and a peppery rum scent. Flavor is similar to the aroma, with an absence of the caramels evident in the 8's and 12's, and a much stronger presence of fruits and spice. Slightly bitter, yet smooth in the swallow and a dry finish. The lower warming character associated with the lower ABV makes this a better afternoon or summer beverage than its siblings. Pretty solid and easily drinkable brew, but with a tad less complexity than the other St. Bernardus recipes."
"D-Easily could go through the whole 4 pack of these, if my wallet/conscious would allow me. An excellent brew from an excellent brewery."
"A very good Dubbel with all the qualities of the best in the style."
"If you like Dubbels then please seek out Pater 6. It's such a rewarding beer, and I'm not often crazy about Dubbels. St. Bernardus once again shows why they are a world-class brewery."
"pours a clear reddish brown with a creamy thin tan head that does not go away. Nice lacing sticks to the glass. Smell is somewhat tart fruit and some hay. Taste is dark cherries up front, followed by some sour apple in the middle, a little biscuit after that, and a puckering sour finish. Mouthfeel is good, high initial carbonation that fades rather quickly. Drinkability is pretty good, this beer is a bit too tart for my liking. That plus the high price means I probably wont be purchasing it again soon."
"It's a real Dubbel. So if you like your beer to be a Dubbel, get this. It's a good example of what a Dubbel should be."
"Pours a opaque red-brown color with light head. Aroma is hay, Belgian yeast, and raisins. Taste is fruity malts with only a mild sweetness. There's a heavy doughy yeast flavor along with a slight resin hops taste balancing it out. Body is light to medium. Carbonation is medium and soft. Finishing is mild and long-lasting."
"D: Very enjoyable, tasty and well-balanced. I like this, it's lovely. Wouldn't mind another bottle right now!"
"Verdict: Pater 6 is a straightforward, easily drinkable, and enjoyable Dubbel. After trying the smaller of the two St. Bernardus Dubbels and their Tripel, I'm looking forward to trying the beer the slots between them: Prior 8."
"St. Bernardus Pater 6 is a dim, hazy, red-brown ale with lots of particles in it. The head is a big, yellowish, off white foam that has excellent retention and lacing. It has a fruity, leathery aroma with notes of grass, hay, phenol and raisins. It's pretty light and lively with big bubbles. The finish is clean, light and dry. It foams up in my mouth and throat. The flavor has nice balance: a little sweet and a little bitter. It tastes like the aroma, with lots of hay and raisins. Prunes are pretty prominent and apples and cinnamon come out after a while. It leaves the lips a little sweet. This is nice for a session ale."
"D: An enjoyable brew from this brewery, perhaps my favorite of their offerings. I would gladly quaff 3-4 of these in one sitting if that's what was the offer on the table."
"With the low ABV and the lighter-than-expected mouthfeel, this Belgian strong dark is actually very easy to drink. I like the Pater 6 more than I was expecting to, especially as it warms. St. Bernardus did a wonderful job with this offering, and I look forward to the 12."
"Mouthfeel is medium with a smooth amount of carbonation."
"I haven't had a lot of dubbels. But this one is HIGHLY drinkable."
"Overall- Another solid beer by St. Bernardus. An easy drinking Belgian that you could easily have a few of with no worries."
"The nose is excellent. I've said this before, and I'll say it again - I don't drink enough dubbels. Light and bready like freshly toasted raisin wheat toast, a little cocoa, dried, toasted almonds, nutty and rather biscotti-like. No real hops, so to speak, this is a complex, malt-driven beer that eschews the sweetness that plagues so many American-brewed Belgians. The palate opens dry, toasty and moderately bready with a rusk-like sweetness. There's a lot going on here - brown sugar, a light spiciness (particularly on the finish), a little vanilla, a little cola, a little dry, dusty cocoa. Incredibly dry, this is actually quite educational - what can a relatively low ABV, non phenolic Belgian dark ale be? In some ways, this almost vinous, light and fruity, but at the same time, the alcohol is anything but what you'd expect from one. Medium-light in body with a high level of carbonation that manages to stay creamy, there's a light tartness on the finish that again brings to mind fruit - dates and raisins in particular. Expertly conditioned, this is pretty much close to perfect for the style. An excellent beer, this."
"Mouthfeel is ok with a firm carbonation and a dull sweetness that has a hint of a dry finish. I dislike how it coats your mouth with an over sweet aftertaste but the grains come out in the long run leaving their taste in your mouth. Very nice and smooth, drinkable beer that's a solid taster, well worth cheking out and sipping appatheticly. I love how the flavors come out even more as the beer warms to room temp."
"D- Good beer and definitely worth a try"
"Very enjoyable beer, plenty of rich flavor throughout, and it has a distinctive bite to it to separate it from the pack. I would definitely come back for a second round."
"A really solid beer, my second favorite of the numbered St. Bernardus beers. Very complex for only 6.7%."
"Would get this again for sure. Very refreshing and sweet."
"decent beer nothing really special but worth trying"
"D: This is tasty, easy-drinking, and refreshing."
"The aroma is maltier than I expected, it has some bready notes. The fruit aromas are of cider, grape and a bit of dark fruits like raisin. The aroma finishes up with some alcohol spiciness. The flavor follows the nose closely, the malt flavor is strong and bready followed by a dark fruit sweetness. the grape flavor is also there and it brings a little bit of undesirable tartness. It dries up nicely in the finish."
"d- this is probably more drinkable than the prior 8, but i might prefer the 8 a little bit better. regardless this is a top notch dubbel."
"D- Very light, refreshing, and complex."
"In some aspects, I prefer this beer to St. Bernardus' Abt 12. The lower alcohol content reveals more in the aroma and in the taste. I highly recommend this beer."
"D: Great dubbel, easy to pound, lovely flavor."
"(D)- A clean and smooth yet an earthy driven dubbel with some good things going for it. Would like to see more of those dark fruits to show up, but it is still a good brew."
"This is a very easy to drink beer, though I don't find myself craving more, so it's drinkable, but not overly so. A solid Belgian abbey ale."
"This was the first bottle I opened from the St. Bernardus gift pack (4-pack w/ glass) and needless to say I'm excited to make my way to the Abt 12."
"D- One of the best dubbels that I've had. A truly great brew."
"A good beer with lower more acceptable abv's meaning that I can drink a few, no problem."
"Not as good as ABT 12, but it stands as a great beer."
"Brilliant beer from a top-notch brewery. One of the very best Dubbels I've ever enjoyed. Must-try."
"Mouthfeel/drinkability: Medium bodied with fairly high carbonation. The carbonation is very light and lively. Very dry finish."
"This is a very drinkable and enjoyable table beer. St. Bernardus continues to impress me and it is clear they know how to do things well in Watou. Whenever I finally take my dream trip to Belgium, this will surely beer one of the breweries I have to hit up."
"Drinkability is good. Flavorful beer, smooth and not a high abv bomb. Very enjoyable slow sipper. I could do a second one easily!!!"
"The drinkability is fairly high. The ABV is easily managed and well incorporated making for easy drinking. The flavor profile is pleasing, and the aroma pulls you in for another sip. It's really a nice little beer."
"Very nice! The first of the 4 beers of the St. Bernadus gift pack. I picked this first because of the lower ABV of 6.7% and because it got a lower rating than the Abt 12 which I'll drink next, but this is a fabulous brew! Easy to drink and very tasty. Great complexity! Enjoy!"
"This is the last of the St. Bernardus 4 pack that I picked up a few weeks ago. I'm so glad that I spent the money on this set. The beers are absolutely fantastic and the glass is a perfect chalice. So far to date I think this is my favorite Belgian brewery. I know I haven't had many, but out of what I know these guys do the best."
"drinkability - very enjoyable - little pricey"
"Drinkability: A good beer and a fairly easy drinker. Definitely worth a taste and something I would have no problem drinking again."
"Drinkabilty - High. Its smooth, mild and refreshing. Its not the best dubbel ive ever had but its fine to drink, and to enjoy."
"D - Excellent drinkability, very smooth. Excellent food beer."
"This pours a deep, deep copper with a beautiful one finger head that sticks around as good as any beer I've had. The nose is a mellow fig and grapefruit mixture with something like worn leather further back. On the tongue the grapefruit flavors come out strongest. The mouthfeel is pleasantly prickly and it goes down pretty easily. A great beer, one I'll be revisiting."
"D- Easy to drink, fairly tasty, and a not so high abv. Could potentially make this a session beer."
"D - Very drinkable beer. At 6.7% its not too big either. My first beer from this brewery and I can't wait to try the others."
"An excellent dubbel; very tasty and enjoyable with no hints of alcohol."
"Very drinkable, doesn't feel like a 6.7% ABV"
"A nice enough dubbel, with the attendant sweetness, but surprisingly dry, which I can't fault, making it all the more drinkable."
"Drinkability: Meh, its drinkable but not the best I've had from St. Bernardus or dubbels for that matter. I'd prefer a little more of a malt body from the beer."
"O: Good drinkability. Not the best St. Bernardus that I've had but for sure a great beer"
"D: Very easy drinking dubbel, low enough alcohol to enjoy two or three of these. Definitely is enhanced by the breweries glass, the beer appears to be bigger and makes for a longer session."
"Pours a nice reddish brown color with a bit of an off white head and some lacing. Nose brings caramel, dark fruits, apple, and brown sugar. Good amount of slightly-dry sweetness in the taste with some dates, raisins, brown sugar, caramel, bread, and hints of dark rum. Nice, creamy mouthfeel that really aids in the drinkability when combined with the taste."
"Excellent beer, I could have this any time. Easy drinking and nicely flavoured."
"D: There is a like to like here... ABV is not bad... Pretty complex flavors in all.. This is a sit back and enjoy kind of brew... Worth looking for !!"
"Dryness and light-ish spiky body make this a highly drinkable Dubbel."
"very nice balance of flavors to alcohol. while not thick there is definitely something there. easily drinkable, almost to a fault."
"D- very drinkable. Having a few of these would be no problem for anyone who loves a good beer. This doesn't taste nor feel like a 6.7% beer, and that only adds to its appeal. I think this beer could be enjoyed by most people in search of a good beer."
"This beer poured a ruddy brown with a good bit of sediment and an inch of off-white foam. The smell was a little disappointing, a little bruised apple, raisins, and medicinal phenols. The beer tasted like oxidized apples, raw walnuts, a little clove spice, raisin bread, and some bitterness in the finish. The beer was softly carbonated with a smooth body."
"All in all, a very drinkable dubble here. It's very balanced, taste is very smooth and alcohol is not evident at all. I recommend this beer."
"A decent straight forward dubbel, not much character to it but it holds its own from technical merit."
"All in all the abt 12 is still much better than either the Prior 8 or the Pater 6. However, I much prefer the 6 to the 8. Great brewery nonetheless. A go to when bars have it."
"11.2 oz bottle poured into a Unibroue tulip. Paired with steak, pierogies, and onions sautéed in butter. Color is a flat milk chocolate brown with an off white head. Carbonation started out very strong, but mellowed out within five minutes. Body is medium in texture. The flavor is sweet raisins and prunes with a very typical and prominent Belgian yeast. Rich spices with a creamy caramel malt flavor finish this beer off nicely."
"It lacks some of the intensely expressive flavor that the very best in this style offer (Westmalle Dubbel), but this is only a half step below. There's plenty to like here and at under $9 for a 750mL bottle it's a great value to pair with a special meal on a cold evening."
"D: Excellent beer which is quite drinkable for a Dubbel offering. Great session beer!"
"Surprisingly light body. Nice carbonation. The drinkability is very good. Only the high ABV keeps it out of session territory."
"The drinkability is good, not outstanding. Three or four of these bad boys, and you might be doing your best imitation of a crab walking. It went quite well with the spicy baked chicken I had. Now I'm looking forward to having the tripel by this brewer."
"D: I really enjoyed it. A beer that could be drunk throughout the night, but I don't have that kind of money."
"All in all this beer is quite enjoyable without being overly complex. It's a fairly straight-forward abbey style dubbel which tastes exactly how it should, with just enough intricacy to keep you interested."
"D - Very easy drinking beer though the watery style was not too ""for me""; interesting citrus hoppiness which I do not think is common in dubbels or Belgian dark brews. A good beer albeit not great; I would prefer the Prior 8. (4)"
"Medium body with light effervescence on the tip of the tongue. A touch tart and dry with a warming all over. I highly recommend this one."
"D: drinks like a bigger beer than it is. approaches the realm of being a sipper. very complex."
"D: I thoroughly enjoyed this beer, but I probably wouldn't drink another the same night, or buy it again for a while. Very different from the Prior 8 and, in my opinion, not quite as good."
"All well balanced."
"Taste has that same assertive yet soft carbonation to it, reminds me of a cola without the harshness of it, malt forward with a hint of fruitiness in the aftertaste, not overly complex which is a bit of a surprise."
"Beer is medium to thin in body. Tastes good. Sweet with no bitterness. Everything is forward. Good yeast character and flavors. Nice esters, finish cleanly. Not dry. Drinkability high. I really love this brewery and this beer."
"Poured from the bottle into my snifter, with a dark garnet-brown color and a whitish-tan head that dissipated quickly and crowns with a scattering of bubbles in the top. Smell is dark fruits with some slight spiciness. Taste is very much the same with some more malt presence. Crisp carbonation that gives a great tingling feel throughout. Enjoyable but not quite my favorite representative of the dubbel."
"M, D - Lively CO2, with a medium body and good drinkability. Not unpleasant, but I perceived a lack of something... body? complexity?"
"Drinkability: Hard to believe this is a little 6.7% beer because its pretty complex. Kind of the little brother to the Prior 8, which to me is a better dubbel."
"D- Not a bad dubbel, but the flavor profile was just a little on the thin side for me; a great beer to have with some stinky cheese for sure."
"A very tasty dubbel with plenty going on and clean and dry enough to keep me coming back for more."
"Malty, but balanced, it's a pleasant dubbel!"
"More fruit and sweet malt flavors appear as the beer warms. Highly drinkable and very enjoyable, I would have this again and recommend this beer."
"Notes: Best before 24/09/12. Good lighter bodied and subtler Dubbel, but still full on flavor and complex. Not as dark or as much dark fruit as other stronger versions of the style, but they are still present and provide a lot of flavor. This is probably just as good as the Prior 8, just a bit different. Another great beer from a great brewery. Definitely worth a try."
"Poured hazy copper color with a large light brown head that lasted with good lacing. Very complex herbs and yeasty banana aroma. Medium body with a smooth texture and soft carbonation. Full complex fruit and spicy sweet flavor with solid sweet finish of moderate duration. Very good brew."
"I would call this an ok beer."
"Cheers!"
"Good beer, but by no means great."
"Mouthfeel is very full, creamy and rich. Taste is fairly sweet and sharp - it's a bit cold so I'm going to have to let this warm up a bit. A bit spicy with a fairly bland/boring finish."
"Drinkability - It's a very nice beer, certainly has my interest piqued for the rest of the St. Bernardus line, but too much carbonation for me to want to seek this one out again."
"D - Quite drinkable, this beer has all of the characteristic complexity of a dubbel despite its having a somewhat lower than average alcohol content for the style. The fruit character is quite nice and comes from both the yeast and the rich, carmel malt. There is a plum malt character present that I am more used to seeing in dark German lagers such as bocks. This malt complexity is able to shine through thanks to the relative lightness of the beer and lack of very strong alcohol and yeast character that one often sees in stronger dark belgian beers. A very nice example of the style, just as well made as its more revered big brother, Abt 12."
"This beer taste like unicorns and rainbows had sex in my glass. It looks like Niagara Falls, smells like a rainforest and taste like a million doves covered in milk chocolate. There are a zillion serious reviews of this beer and if you dig that, don't bother reading this one. It's a fantastic beer. Loose yourself in a St-Bernardus Pater 6, it's worth it."
"This is a great beer with a lot of flavors, but 1 or 2 is enough for me."
"Poured into a chalice."
"Drinkability is OK, not quite up to what I expected, but tasty nonetheless."
"This beer pours a cloudy dark to medium brown with some reddish hues and a foamy khaki head. Aromas of orange and cream with a touch of lemon zest. The palate is light with malty flavors with hints of orange zest. Finishes slightly acidic, it actually bites the sides of your tongue as you swallow."
"nice beer, not as good as some of the other stuff from st bernardus, but good."
"Rather sessionable in general. Relatively very sessionable."
"Flavor follows with a light and fruity malt presence. Never overpowering or sweet, yet balanced and quite delicate in fact, particularly for a style that has a history of manhandling its way through life. Firm carbonation keeps the light body from appearing thin on the finish. Nicely done approachable Dubbel. I dig on the more complex Prior 8 but this is quite good."
"D – This is a good beer, but not as good as 8, 12 or Tripel."
"One of the better Belgian Dubbels available."
"This is a world class beer for the style in my opinion."
"if you like belgians, be sure to give this one a try. another great beer by a great brewery."
"D - High and a good showing for a Dubbel."
"Drinkability: a solid Belgian Dubbel that is easy to consume. One large bottle is enough for a session, but I can opening another bottle. This is a well crafted beer."
"Its a good ass beer, what else would you expect from these guys?"
"Pours a two finger off-white head that fades slowly to a thin layer, leaving some lace. Hazy brown color. Not much to the nose. Good carbonation and medium bodied. Flavor is hard to nail down like a brown with hints of dark fruit, dry finish. $17.00 for a gift pak of four 330ml bottles from Tully's Beer & Wine Wells, Me."
"Overall a great beer. It never demands too much, and doesn't make assumptions, but still manages to leave a great impression. I'd call it a naturally charismatic beer."
"Drinkability: This one surprised me with its light and refreshing tartness and reminded me in several ways of the Rochefort 6 I had just a few days ago.. No question it is a beer I'd willing to to have another of right now, and I'll expect I'll be drinking a few more of these. That being said, its not a beer I'd make a special effort to find or pick in preference to a number of others."
"Drinkability: I really like this beer and could sip one for a long time as I enjoyed the malty apple taste. Not the best I have had in the style, but certainly up there. I do want some more."
"Poured into St. Bernardus glass brown with a one finger white head. Decent lacing. Smells of nuts and grapefruit. The taste is warming, with that grapfruit flavor coming out along with a nutty dryness. The mouthfeel is just about perfect. There is no alcohol burn because of the lower alcohol level, so the drinkability is good."
"D: This one is basically a lighter, easier drinking version of St. Bernardus Prior 8. Both are good dubbels, but for overall drinkability, this one is slightly above Prior 8. However, for sheer taste and complexity, I would take Prior 8 over this one."
"Taste: Similar to the smell there is a very nice fruity (fig) taste with a little hint of bitterness. The flavors aren't powerful but they are a nice mix."
"D - The mild flavor palate and nice mouthfeel make this an extremely quaffable dubbel. Looking forward to the rest of my St. Bernardus gift pack."
"If they were trying to make a weaker version of their larger beers they suceeded unfortunately the flavor profile is completely lacking without the additional strength."
"I bought this as a smaple/gift pack right before christmas. This beer is accompanied with an 8, 12, and tripel along with a St. Bernardus chalice. The only reason I got this was because I could buy 4 beers with a chalice for only $16. I am glad that I got a chance to try this but this style is something that I probably wouldn't get again."
"D - Meh. Not a great example of a dubble for me. Not a terrible brew by any means, but so much more could be done here. It's not really inviting in any way and just bland overall."
"D- kind of a disappointment. probably wont be going back to this one. lets hope the other two beers in this gift set are a little more to my liking."
"D: this is very drinkable given its complexity. It tastes great, but doesn't have an overwhelming body or alcohol content that could detract from its drinkability."
"D: Your standard beer from St. Bernardus. Very solid but nothing outrageous or Courageous for that matter. This is what you'd expect and if you want the standard of a dubbel, this is where you turn."
"Overall, very good."
"Very drinkable and lots of flavor for a smaller dubbel."
"Very easy to drink."
"d - great sipper."
"Drinkability- Slightly lighter than expected, but still a sipper IMO."
"D - Really liked this one, smooth drinking nice taste close favorite now to the abt 12."
"Damn, I expect this from the Abt12 but Pater 6 comes through just as much. This needs to be a repeat buy for me."
"This is a very good beer, though I'd put it a notch below the Prior 8 as it's not as complex and is a bit thinner in the body. But, that's some pretty stiff competition and this is still better than most dubbels out there."
"Drinkability is decent, but to be honest, the carbonation gets to be a bit much. Doesn't quite measure up to the Abt 12 or Prior 8. Found the taste to be a bit too subdued for a Belgian."
"D: A pretty enjoyable beer, but I prefer the 8."
"Pours a creamy, caramely-looking russet brown out of a capped 11.2 oz. bottle. Billowy light-tan head diminishes somewhat quickly to a surface sheen. Characteristic aroma notes of raisins, ripe plums, figs, candy sugar and toffee. The taste is creamy sweetness at the back of the tongue, which dominates at first, giving way to a more tart fruitiness up front, with a pleasing sweet-tart finish. The bulk of the flavor is at the sweet end of the spectrum, but it stops just short of being cloying. Smooth, silky mouthfeel but a little treacly to drink all night. Still an excellent dubbel, but I wouldn't expect anything less from this brewery."
"Flavor is mild. Not much going on. Not bad, just pretty plain. A little hint of dried fruit, slight sugary malts. A tad too carbonated. Not a bad brew...just falls pretty far in comparison with the Prior 8 Dubel, let a lone the Apt 12 Quad."
"This is an extremely easy drinker whose well-constructed medium body is lightened to exceptional fluffiness and quaffability by the torrent of internal carbonation."
"D: very, very nice; but something to enjoy over a nice long conversation."
"Nice and heavy -> not great for sessioning."
"Murky brown pour topped with a fluffy mocha head. Plums and prunes in the aroma. Roasted malts too, with a mild alcohol waft to back it all up. Wood and prunes in the mouth, roasted malts, with a fruity alcohol aftertaste. Smooth and creamy mouthfeel. Medium bodied. Pretty good."
"Dark copper, ruby with abubble bath-like thin head. Carameled honey with some light toffee, a little bit of sweetness on the nose. Medium carbonation, medium level of bitterness with a tight, creamy maltiness. A bit of an alcohol kick. Finish is not quite as long as hoped. It's a good beer, no doubt but not the best from this brewery or in this style.I'd get it again though."
"Dark brown with medium tan head, some lacing. Aroma of raisins, vanilla and malt. Medium-mouthed, flavor of raisins, caramel and more malt. Good balance with a slightly bitter finish. A junior version of the Prior - in strength, not in flavor. Very nice."
"Probably my least favorite of the St. Bernardus beers, but it's still quite good and one I'd definately drink again."
"D easy to drink, my second beer from St Bernardus nice but not quite up to the Abt 12 though."
"Tastes sweet with a malty, and somewhat dry bitter aftertaste. Medium body and very drinkable on a cold blustery New England night."
"Overall: Nice beer. Really different from the ABT. Will have this one time after time after time..."
"Cheers!!!"
"D: Flavorful with a pretty crisp finish."
"D: Extremely drinkable, a very consistent dubbel that I really enjoyed. The carbonation was almost offensive, but didn't quite get there. Otherwise, very good."
"This is a nice Dubbel, very tasty. Good balance and taste. Just subtle enough alcohol tastes. This type of brew is a bit strong to session, but it makes a good case to try. Good brew."
"D: This drinks like a low-ABV brown ale, with infinitely more complexity and flavor. A slam-dunk from St. Bernardus--this would be my everyday, go-to beer if I were living in Belgium."
"Found this for $3.39 a bottle at the new Bottle Shop in Gastonia. Big fan of the brewery so why not try this one? Could tell from the appearance this was a dubbel, but it took a while to warm up til I got the nice fruit notes, belgian yeast, and medium body. Definitely a good example, but nothing to knock my socks off."
"Excellently crafted, as you would expect from St Bernardus, this easily vaults into my favourite beers."
"D Very good with managable ABV and basic taste. It would likely cost a lot to drink this as a session beer, I am afraid."
"(From tasting notes dated 23 Aug 2009)"
"#4 of my St. Bernardus six pack sampler. Pours a reddish brown color into my 25cl Chimay goblet, head is about one finger and disappears quite fast, almost before I started drinking the beer, a good blanket after the fizzy head. Little-no lacing is left on the glass after the beer is done. Rest of the review is almost a clone of the Prior 8 without alcohol presence. Tastes and smells of malts, light fruits (some apples), belgian yeast and spices, raisins and no alcohol, nice. The mouthfeel is a bit light, almost medium, with good carb and a smooth way about it. Only gripe here is this beer has the least after taste I have ever experienced. Drinkable as any Belgian, probably the most drinkable Belgian I have had, it is like a Dubbel-Lite, very refreshing, will have again."
"D: I like the diversity form the other Bernardus beers. A pleasant drink combining sweet fruits, malts and bitterness in an elegant way. Will surely buy this again."
"D: I don't really like this one, just too sweet, doesn't really stack up to the Prior 8. I wouldn't say it is a chore to drink this, because it is pleasant, but definitely not one of the first Dubbel's I would suggest or look for. Seems to come up lacking in the otherwise great lineup of beers from St. Bernardus."
"D - This beer had a good flavor profile, not as good as the Prior 8 or the Abt 12, but still a good beer"
"Maybe it's because I'm reviewing this in the middle of summer, but this has become my favorite offering from St. Bernardus. The low alcohol level for the style makes this an excellent dubbel to drink in hot weather."
"Overall - This could only be a Belgian ale. However, this is really lacking in flavour to back up the high yeast content. I'm hoping the Prior 8 has more flavour."
"Drinkability: So far, my least favorite of the St. Bernardus offerings. It's not a bad beer, but I prefer their other dubbel, the Prior 8, much more."
"A complex, tasty brew - but very drinkable. The flavor holds nicely, and this never devolves into one of those 'hard to drink' speciality beers. This one's a repeat go-to."
"Believe it or not, but Pater 6 reminds me a lot of Coopers Sparkling Ale. It has a similar tasty complexity, and a similar tangy yeastiness that I do not like. A good beer, but not a great Belgian."
"D - This was a hard to find beer, but really worth the trouble. Complex and really interesting."
"Nice smooth mouthfeel with lower carbonation than expected. Very drinkable other than the high price. $6 for a small bottle is pretty steep."
"This is not an overly powerful or complex dubbel, but highly drinkable"
"The feel is a little oily and slick, but still refreshing. There is a slight warm feel to this brew too. Overall Pater 6 is a pretty good dubbel."
"Has a light, airy feel when drinking it, very creamily meringue like. Chocolaty flavor with some dark berry juices and dates or figs with an almond like nutty essence. I dont get a whole bunch of rich, yeasty esters but it still maintains a nice complex profile. This is a great beer."
"Pater 6 was my second stop on my four part journey through St Bernardus beers. Prior 8 and Abt 12 are up next."
"T/M: Medium to high carbonation with moderate body gives a nice creamy texture. Malty up front followed by the sweets in the nose, again, all subdues. A touch of warming alcohol in the throat and slight sourness in the aftertaste. Still a great beer."
"Notes - Thin mouthfeel but good carbonation. A very good beer, kind of a toned down Abt 12."
"Pours a fogged in orange hued brown with a sizeable creme head. Nose is lots of sugar and lots of malts as well. Flavor is malty and earthy sweet again with a bitter hop edge on the side. Spices are clearly evident. Overall tone is earthy and robust. Feel reminds me a bit of Westy 12, though much harsher on the carbonation. Bites too much IMO. Overall a nice dubbel. Classy and classic. If you haven't had all of the St. Bernardus line yet, you might as well get to it."
"This is the first dubbel I have had the opportunity to review and it is quite a delicious, complex beer - exactly what I have come to expect from St. Bernardus. It's quite complex in its blend of dark fruits and malts, and there is a good balance between the subtle sweetness of dried fruits and the toasted, biscuit malt profile to make for an enjoyable sipper, one that continually begs for another sip to unlock more of the flavors hidden within. I would recommend this beer."
"3.5 D: Good beer, but not at this price."
"Fantastic beer."
"M/D - Classic Belgian in that it is very carbonated. Almost a bit over-carbonated, but it does give the beer the sense of being a little more dry, which I like. Its low-ish ABV and lower sweetness (compared to most Belgians) make it fairly drinkable. Another solid offering from St. Bernardus."
"I enjoy how this beer appears golden-brown in the light. Fine yeast particles are visible, which is nice in comparison of beers with larger particles. The head was surprisingly resilient as well. Dark fruits dominate the smell, with candy sugar strong too. Also, there is a funky aroma to this beer, which gives it some character. I think the caramel is strongest in the flavor, and the dark fruits creep in a second or two after sipping. Mouthfeel is a little on the thin side. However, with the lower than average ABV and good taste, this is one of the most drinkable Dubbels I've had."
"In summary, I can't say enough about how much I enjoyed this brew and like I said, I plan on many, many more of these in the near future."
"OVERALL: A great example of what a dubbel should be. Looked and felt great, and had the nose and taste profile to match. Very enjoyable and drinkable; if you like dubbels and haven't had this one yet, you're missing out. One I'll definitely pick up again. Recommended."
"I liked this and I feel I like Dubbels and Abbey styles when they have aged. The sediment in this one was very dark."
"Out of a 750ml corked and caged bottle. Pours a hazy milk chocolate color with a small tan head. Light candi sugar, clove and coriander on the nose, some carob as well. Nice candi sugar flavor to start, some floral spices, clove, and rusty mineral water. Some carob notes and a light bittering hop in the end that dries out the brew and offsets the sweet. The feel is fairly light with very active carbonation that lends itself to be crisp. Good balance between sweet and bitter/dry. A nice flavorful dubbel, nice and easy to drink."
"M = Medium bodied, good mouthcoating."
"D) Pater 6 is 6.7 ABV which is light when compared to many other strong Belgian ales, but it means you can have more than one and walk away (please don't drive away). Truly a great beer."
"33 cL, slender Belgian bottle with 33 04 10 on the back label; sampled 7/15/08. The beer is dark, maroon-hued, with little bits of sediment, and three fingers of slowly-receding head that leaves a few wisps of lacing. Sweet and mildly nutty in the nose, with notes of raisins, red apples, yeast, aged malts, sherry?, chocolate? and light oxidation that is in no way offensive. It becomes very aromatic at the end, almost bordering on pungent. The flavor needs some time to open up, but when it does, it unleashes fruity esters and alcohols, a touch of green hops, a dose of bitter yeast, chocolate?, caramel?, mild bitterness and a light phenolic character. Very malty, even well into its lightly sweet finish. It is lightish and dry on the palate, with strong, prickly carbonation that makes me burp after the first sip. When it calms down, the body becomes more full, with a powdery yeast feel, and some warming alcohol. Delicious and complex to say the least; this is a very nice ale that has aged well so far, and I'm sure will continue to do so. As with the rest of their beers, ""heavenly nectar"" is right."
"Pater 6 is a very, very good beer. As far as Dubbels go, it certainly competes with the best of them. As good as it is, it's just not quite as refined or well put together as say....Westvleteren 8. The flavor profile really needs something to carry it to that next level. I can't quite put my finger on what exactly it needs. Perhaps a little more spices to ramp up the pizzazz. There's nothing overtly wrong with it. In fact, it's very good beer. I have no reservations recommending it at all. Just needs a little something more to carry it to the next level."
"M&D: the palate comes slightly effervescent, but gradually softening as the beer goes, while the body is just integrated and at the medium level to suit the overall moderate flavour profile. This is a rather quiet Abbey ale that deserves respect and slow sipping, but in copious amounts!!"
"D: I could drink a couple of these any time."
"Overall this is a very nice beer for the style, you really can't go wrong when Bernardus is in the name."
"Overall a very complex beer, but as I said a bit too sweet and fruity for me. Still I can see the quality in this beer."
"This has to be one of the better dubbels I've tasted in some time. Not bad at all."
"Drinkability- Very Smooth and very little aftertaste"
"Overall a delicious, drinkable, and refreshing dubbel."
"This was one of those little treats that the beer gods give us to make winter nights a little easier to get through."
"Pours a ruby brown color, lighter edges. Off-white head, frothy but small. Hoppy aroma, grapefruit. Dark woodsy scent, malts and alcohol. Aroma of spices when inhaling deeply, some sweetness and caramel. Caramel and sweetness, dark raisiny taste. Spices, clove. Sickly sweet aftertaste. Warming up...taste of something dark might be the oak - a hard flavor. A lot of alcohol. Too alcoholy.Pours a dark brown color, reddish slight orangish color. Dull tannish head, good lacing. Very grapey dark fruity taste, some spice leather-like. Some other fruit like mango or something. But somewhat faint. Fizzy dark fruit, dark leather aftertaste, then mellowing. Musky-like. Too heavy a flavor for my liking. Light grapes too, as it warms up."
"D - if it had less carbonation this would be a pretty drinkable brew. if it had more sweetness this would be a pretty drinkable brew. if it had more sweetness and less carbonation this would be a very, very good brew."
"Flavor consisted of malt, earth, cocoa, and a hint of oak. Not as sweet as what I expected, given the maltiness; the flavor has a slight dryness at the end."
"Overall- pretty drinkable beer, a little lighter then I anticipated and not as complex as I had hoped."
"Best before date of May 16th, 2011. Poured into a St Bernardus goblet a ruddy brown color with amber highlights and a small but firm off-white head leaving behind some nice lacing. Aroma is yeasty, herbal and grassy, a bit of hay, and some spiced apple. First sip brings out some apple flavors, some grassy, herbal hops, light caramel and a little bit of dark fruits. The spiciness isn't overbearing, but it's there and adds a decent complexity to this beer. It's all apples and hay, reminiscent of a hay-ride around Halloween time. Some nuttiness starts to come out as it warms. Medium-light in body. There's a ton of carbonation in this beer that's a bit too spritzy at first, but mellows down a bit upon warming. It's a tasty beer, but I've had much better Dubbels coming out of Belgium than this one. I picture this one as a table beer and would be great with several dishes."
"Overall - A real stunner. Wow! It seams as though the more you drink it the greater the experience. If I had one word to describe this ale it would be 'Superb'."
"Great stuff..."
"D= average. I would maybe have it on a special occasion or something but not my favorite"
"Very smooth, rich liquid. Not as sweet as the smell indicates. Does not display the typical Belgian yeast flavors, so this tastes closer to a doppelbock to me. This is a great, easy-to-drink Belgian ale."
"D: Goes down a little too easy, I wish I could afford to drink more of it."
"Obviously a beer not designed for quaffing, but for sipping/enjoying. Still, very easy to drink"
"D= I haven't had this one in a while and I had forgotten what a great beer it is. Very drinkable and damn near sessionable for a Belgian ale."
"MF&D - Medium/thin bodied. Good carbonation and drinkablity make this one a winner."
"It's no Westy 8 but in the Dubbel category this one is up there for me. Wish I could figure out why every St. Bernardus beer I try foams over even though it's served at the proper temperature. Nevertheless, it's pretty damn tasty and worth picking up."
"D- 5.0 all around. you cant fail on this one!"
"Drinkability..this is my new go to beer. It's not nearly as difficult to find as the Westy of course, but still not extremely easy to come by here."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, lighter than I look for in the style."
"No real strong flavors to slow you down coupled with a manageable abv, make this guy pretty easy to drink."
"I don't think I have ever seen this been in stores before. I'm going to keep a sharp eye out for it."
"D: While I enjoyed this beer more or less, I wish I could generate a little more enthusiasm for something. It is unassuming, but to a fault I think."
"God, this went down easy! It's like a sessionable version of Abt 12 - relatively speaking. 6.7% will still drop you on your butt if you make this beer your companion for the night. Other than in the appearance - and even that wasn't too much of a letdown - this beer showed no sign of being 2 years past it's prime, nevermind what the label said. Far as I can tell, St.Bernardus doesn't make a bad beer."
"Another great beer from St. Bernardus. Pours a rich brown with a creamy tan head. Nose has rich malts, ripe fruit, spicy yeast and subtle hops. No huge flavors, but very well balanced. Medium body is nicely carbonated. A good traditional example of the style. Would make the perfect session beer if it were a bit cheaper."
"This beer strikes me as being two things: spicy and drinkable. At nearly 7%, this baby drinks like a mild thanks to the dry and thin body. As for the spice, phenols are the dominate flavor-maker, with a red peppercorn bite next to the also spicy hops. The malt provides a subtle toffee back note for the spice and help create the delicate balance. This beer could have a little more flavor, but I'll be damned if I couldn't put down a number of these without thinking about it."
"D: This is a good beer, to me it's like Prior 8 light. There's nothing wrong with that, I just thought it would be something a little different. Certainly worth a purchase for the Belgian fan if you want an easy drinking lighter beer."
"A nice Dubbel. Not my favorite of the style, but pleasant and inoffensive."
"This may not be my favourite dubbel or my favourite offering from this brewery, but it's certainly a beer I'd never turn down drinking. It's a fine example of Belgian tradition and craftsmanship. If the idea of a beer packed with fig, apple, plum and rum-raisin flavour sounds appealing to you, then I'd definitely recommend St. Bernardus Pater 6."
"D: A subtle Belgian dubbel. Unlike other examples that are over the top and not very discreet. Very Drinkable (even for someone like me who does not care for many Belgian styles (=headache). Drinking this makes me want to brew up a batch of dubbel on my next brewday."
"D- Due to the light nature and relatively low ABV, this is one of the few dubbels I could see being a potential session beer. It's not the best dubbel I've ever had by any means, but it's very pleasant. If I was trying to get someone into belgian beer that has little experience, I would definitely recommend this one to them."
"This poured an opaque brown with fluffy tan head. It smelled like light earthy caramel malt and wild yeast with lemon/lime hops. It tasted like strong earthy caramel malt, sweet and creamy cultured yeast, and lemon/lime hops. It was fairly thin and very carbonated, with a bittersweet aftertaste. Overall this was much less yeasty than I expected, with a very nice and clean flavor. I would have preferred less carbonation, and it wasn't terribly complex, but it was quite enjoyable and easy to drink. This could be a regular drinker."
"Nice to sip on this one...a lot of Dubbels are too clean on the flavor profile for me but this is very full."
"A true classic, which holds its own with the 8 and the 12 ."
"I really liked this beer. It appears like the run-of-the-mill brun; but doesn't have the overtly sweet malty taste which I sometimes find not so pleasing. In addition to the lack of plenty malt, I still detected some hints of toffee and burned caramel. In the mouth it was a mid-weight feel and had some carbonation. Due to its mildness in flavor I think it'd be an excellent beer to enjoy a few glasses of."
"Very drinkable, compared to other St. Bernardus brews. Great beer overall."
"Carbonation, good taste, and low abv make it a great drinking belgian."
"Great beer, great flavors and complexity, easy drinking,"
"D: The magnum of Pater 6 I had said 4.7abv on the label (I saved it so I'll doiuble-check. I thought it very drinkable both in flavor and complexity while the reasonable abv brought me to the end of the magnum but not my senses."
"A: Thick fluffy alabaster head, deep ruby red with brown base - 4.75, S: Subtle grain, slightly nutty with some mild spice - 4.5, T: Very tasty, lots of flavor but not overwhelming, a very mellow and pleasing flavor, some slight hop bite on the tail, some nuttiness - 4.50, M: Creamy, and medium bodied - 4.75, D: A very palate friendly beer - 4.5"
"The beer pours a cloudy brown with a medium white head. The aroma is sour malt, maybe a bit of grass as well. The aroma is rich and malty with a bit of sweet around the edges. The feel is heavy and wet. This is a real malt lovers delight, and one I will have to revisit."
"Pater 6 pours a murky tan brown color with a small beige head. The nose is of subtle roasted chocolate malts and nuts. Lots of toasty malt flavor, classic Belgian yeast notes, but with a very light body and no true hop character. IMO a dubbel should have more 'chew' but that doesnt make this a bad beer. Very drinkable."
"An excellent option when you want a Bernardus but don't want the 10%+ ABV. The Pater 6 loses a little of the complexity and flavor undercarriage you find in the 12, but not a whole lot. Still pours a dark amber, still an excellent nore, flavors of roast malt and sugar and dark fruits. Outstanding for only 6.7%ABV. I prefer the 8 myself, but the 6 will definitely do in a pinch. We are talking about some of the best beers in the world here."
"A must try!"
"So I guess the ""6" in Belgium is reserved for the more ""sessionsable"" beers. pours like dark apple juice with a decent off white head. the nose is yeasty, some red apple skin. the taste is of roasted malt, red apple again, grainy in a good way. medium to full bodied, low spritzy carbo. nice"
"2/26/2008. Hazy brownish color topped with a decent sized off-white head. Aroma is slightly fruity, with malts and cherries. Sweet and sugary tasting, somewhat fruity with maltiness. Maybe a little too sweet. Medium-bodied. A good tasting beer. Seemed similar to the Chimay Premier Red I had yesterday but if forced to I'd give that one the nod."
"D: High for this style of beer...Although the yeasty flavor could ward me off after a while"
"A cocoa-brown color with a two-finger head that left some minor lacings. A light hop smell combined with dark fruits and some caramel and doughiness. Smooth and medium-bodied, this beer contains some dark and tropical fruit tastes that are real good along with a pronounced sweet malt presence. An enjoyable beer that I recommend to anyone who enjoys a nice Belgian."
"The aroma was brown sugar smell with some fruit and spice. The taste was similar with a solid caramel backing with a spicy finish. It was well carbonated and smooth. Very, very enjoyable Belgian."
"D-Really high, I could drink these with ease and love every drink. So drinkable it could be a session beer but still has great flavor."
"Overall- This was a really nice treat I found stashed in the fridge. It was quite good but may have been even better had it been a fresh bottle. Another heavenly offering from the monks!"
"Overall- Fantastic. Surprisingly my second favorite behind the Abt 12. I really enjoyed this beer a lot."
"D - A nice beer indeed. Not something I'd drink regularly but nice on the odd occasion."
"D: If I could get this on tap everyday I would drink it everyday. Thanks to the Fly Pig for having it on."
"Pours a cloudy dark brown, thick off-white head is thick and stays for the duration, giving off a nice spicy aroma. Notes of corriander, cinnamon and nutmeg. Taste is sweet, wheaty and heavily spiced. The carbonation is high. Though tasty, this isn't a repeatedly drinkable beer. I'd highly recommend one, 'cuz it's good, but I wouldn't drink two in a sitting."
"Color is a dark cola brown, with a big fluffy light tan head with a few speckles in it. Smells very mildly of apples and other sweet fruits. Tastes mildy of lots of different fruits, like apple, grape, fig, berry, with some caramel and brown sugar thrown in. A very pleasant and drinkable beer, just a bit too mild for my tastes."
"D: This brew is pretty drinkable. Has some great flavor and a low ABV makes this a very accessible brew. Really enjoyed it."
"D- One of the best dubbels I've had. Definitely could be a staple."
"The taste is tart upfront soft herbal bitterness followed by some smooth caramel sweetness, fruit, dark pitted finishing a bit tart and bready in the end decent beer but surprisingly sub-par for a St. Bernardus offering. I will have to re-visit down the road."

"D: I wasn't sure what to except with this one, being a huge fan of the Abt 12, I was somewhat skeptical that this beer would not live up to the St. Bernardus label, however, I was very happy with this beer and would def. try it again. I could drink this one all night."
"Drinkability is a laughing matter. This is one of those beers you want to down immediatly,sip constantly, chug like a busch-light-shotgunning teenager. Do they sell kegs of this? Just kidding. In absolute seriousness, this beer is one of the best-delicate,balanced,flavorful. A wonderful drinking experience."
"Poured from an 11.2 ounce bottle into my St. Bernardus chalice. Purchased in August and consumed in April. Pours a very murky brown with a good amount of lacing along the side of the chalice. Very sweet, fruity smell, which comes out in the taste. The taste is overwhelmingly dried fruit with prunes and raisins standing out over everything else. Very bubbly mouthfeel. Low ABV makes this beer drinkable and pretty damn delicious if I do say so myself."
"Overall: Not St. Bernardus' best offering but worth the try nonetheless."
"This beer's superb mouthfeel is defined by the extremely fine carbonation that creates a luxurious palate without a heavy body."
"D: Better than average, but I expect more from Belgians...especially St. Bernardus."
"Overall, quite drinkable. Enjoyable. Not a great dubbel, but worth a try."
"This dubble has a medium body with more than adequate carbonation. Drinkability is good but it is my least favorite of the St. Bernardus family of beers."
"This was the first St Bernardus beer that I have tried. It was served in a standard beer mug. At first the head was about 1"" thick that disappeared pretty fast, however the lacing was good and lasted the whole way down. The color was a cloudy reddish brown. It smelled sweet with a hint of caramel. The taste did not really reflect the smell. It was much more bitter but in a good way. I did enjoy this beer and will be trying more of St Bernardus soon."
"All in all a mixed start to my evening of tastings. I was expecting a lot more from this beer."
"While this one is a great beer on its own, I expect no less from the heavier 8. Of course my chalice is empty, but thanks for another great time bernie."
"Overall and excellant brew with great drinability. Will be sure to pick this one up again."
"St. Bernardus Pater 6 pours a hazy deep amber, almost red and brown at the same time. The aroma is sweet malty dark fruits, with a mild yeasty phenolic quality. The flavor is sweet with bready, biscuity malt upfront. There is a rounded bitterness that balances the beer nicely. The finish is sharp with dark fruity esters, reminiscent of raisins or plums. This beer is a very nice addition to the mix pack, I'm glad to get the chance to try it."
"Amazing lacing on this beer. Color wise, it pours similar to it big brother (Abt 12), muddy brown, with an amber tinge. Aroma is quite nice and complex. Flowers are the first note that hits me, followed by vanilla, raisin, ginger, anise, cinnamon and some yeast and very very slight cereal notes. Flavor is pleasant and refreshing, but nothing to special. Has a nutty finish. I poured one glass at 38F and one at the recommended 48F. I find that it tastes better at the colder 38, but the aroma really comes alive at proper cellar temperatures."
"D- This could be a great session beer for the winter days. My least favorite form this brewery, but still better than most."
"St. Bernardus Pater 6 pours a dark amberish brown. It has a nice fluffy head and a strong smell. Aromas are a blended mix of mild fruits, yeast and malts. The taste offers subtle hints of fruit along with a slight sweetness. Mouthfeel is silky smooth and highly carbonated. Highly carbonated beers usually don't impress me but this type of carbonation is different. Rather that burning the mouth and bloating, it gives a rather unique and pleasant tingle in the chest."
"Even at 6.7% this would be an easy one to session. I never noticed the alcohol and was surprised to see it nearly 7%. I like this one alot, and will find myself pickin up a few more next time i am in the beer store."
"A very good Dubbel. A bit light at times, but refined with no rough edges."
"This was a very enjoyable beer. Easy to have a few of these at a sitting,although it is meant to be sipped"
"D: Suitable as a nice, Sunday afternoon ale. A bit of alcohol punch, but being lighter than its bigger brothers, it is more agreeable for casual drink without being overwhelming."
"Cherry colored body with thick off-white head with tiny bubbles and striped lace. Malty, sour, and slightly moldy smell - not really mold, more like basement. Mild malt IF with sour aftertaste that is long lived and sits on your tongue. Light to medium bodied with fizzy carbonation and dry finish. Overall, eastily drinkable but not terribly complex."
"Tastes of"
"Behold, I think I am developing a taste for sour/funk style European beers."
"Notes: Not the best offering from a usually stellar (onei of my personal favorites) brewery.Not bad, but I don't think I'll be picking this one up again."
"Overall, this is an unusual beer that is drinkable but may take a bit of getting used to. Worth a try. However, I wouldnt get too excited about it."
"Easy to drink, but not good enough that I would seek it out to often."
"The beer pours a dark amber color with a thick frothy offwhite head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is decent. It has a dry, raisiny scent that boasts of crystal and roasted malts. There is little yeast fruitiness present. The taste is decent also. It has a very dry, crystal malt flavor. It goes down with a slight fruitiness and finishes extremely dry with some roasted characteristics. The mouthfeel is average. It is a medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is an above average beer, but not the best effort from this brewery."
"This beer was tasty at the outset, and like many Belgian Ales, became better as it sat and warmed. A most enjoyable beer."
"I will have to say that this is another STRONG brew by St. Bernardus. These guys are so consistant. All of their brews set the tone for their intended style. I enjoyed it tremendously and on a side note: I love Belgian Beer!!"
"D: A nice lighter version of the st bernardus dubbel, well balanced and complex and highly drinkable."
"After another go at this one, I still feel the same. Their other styles are so far superior you wouldn't think they came from the same shop."
"After a night of sampling St. Bernardus' different brews it's easy to proclaim this brewery one of the world's finest. The entire line is rock-solid, and IMO worth the price premium. Amazing!"
"Mouthfeel is thin to medium bodied. This is my least favorite of the St Bernardus beers."
"Color is a deep honey brown, translucent and attractive. Aroma is strongly malty with a hint of banana. Malt dominates the flavor, which has a ribbon of hop bitterness and undertones of banana and cinnamon. Texture is fairly smooth with a good bit of tingle. Finish is pleasant; malty aftertaste has a decidedly fruity tone."
"D: It is an easy smooth, creamy and low ABV brew. However, knowing there are much more appealing Dubbels running around on the loose would drive me mad and limit my consumption to an ""as available"" status."
"Taste is dark fruit, sweet toasted malt, berries, apples, caramel, a little spice and a touch of alcohol as it warms. Mouthfeel is medium light, smooth, a touch heavy on the carbonation, and slightly dry. Easy drinker especially for the style. Purchases as part of the holiday gift pack along with the 8, trippel, 12, and the glass. A good beer, and a very nice start to this gift pack for me."
"A quite enjoyable beer that I'll surely have again. Enjoy."
"Poured a slightly cloudy orange/brown with some suspended particles. The head fades quickly to a thin cap. The smell is sweet and has elements of cinammon and brown sugar. The taste starts with candi sugar up front, followed by tangy Belgian yeast, brown sugar, dark dried fruit, and finishes with pineapple and apple. Mouthfeel is crisp and tangy. Quite delicious."
"D- a great drink"
"Drinkability : Bonne bière d'abbaye (style double)"
"Very smooth and creamy,velvety texture. Feels very pleasing and easy in the mouth, just flows down extra easy. Will definatly drink this beer again, a very nice experiance."
"Mouth feel is creamy and highly carbonated. I found this Dubbel very enjoyable. A great drinker! Was worth trying and I will drink it again. CHEERS!"
"Re-review January 2011: I would add that there are some doughy caramel in the flavors. There is a bit of a banana bread hint or two in the beer. Less coriander, more of the doughy malts. The prickly mouthfeel is a bit more subdued than in many other beers of the style. The aroma is also better this time around."
"D: A beautiful example of the dubbel"
"Brown amber color. A huge light tan head foams up with a huge burst of carbonation. The head then drops to a controlled rocky cap that has great staying power. Smell is very inviting, slight clove, nuts and deap malt bready notes. Taste falls right in to place behind the smell. Very slight clove, but the standout is the malts. Nuttyness and dark breads with just a hint of raisins and a smooth cocoa powder in the finish. Mouthfeel is heavy on the carbonation side but that is to be expected. It mellows as it warms and the smoothness becomes more obvious. This is a smooth drinker that has to be considered one of the models for this style. Can't imagine it getting a whole lot better than this."
"Medium to full bodied, character coming out the ears, but still mighty drinkable."
"Pours a nice dark brown color, nice carbonation, nice one finger plus creamy off-white head, which leaves some nice islands and sticky lacing throughout the drink. The nose is malty, yeasty, can notice some plums, figs, and raisins. The taste is very nice, mostly malty, some yeast tones, and dark fruits. Medium body, a very complex brew and well rounded. Very drinkable, another awesome brew from St. Bernardus."
"Drinkability: This is one amazingly balanced beer. I love it."
"I barely notice the 6.2% abv. Indeed, a drinkable work of art."
"D- This is not what I was expecting at all, but then again this is my first dubbel. I am impressed and am slightly curious as to why so many American brewers try their hand tripels and not so much with the dubbels."
"Above average for a beer in general but given high standards of Belgian ales this one disappoints."
"Drinkability: What's up with that AndoBrew, huh?"
"This beer pours a deep reddish copper color when held up to the light, otherwise it is a deep amber color. It is lightly hazy and is topped by a creamy off white head. The aroma is slightly musty, complex and spicy to boot. A definite spicy brew. The carbonation tingles on my tongue as it goes down. This beer is fairly dry though there is a slight sweetness here. A hint of alcohol character is in the finish. I get hints of bergamot, ginger, pepper and caramel, as well as a bunch of other flavors that I cannot quite pick out. As expected from this ""6" the body is fairly light, though as it warms up it gets a bit thicker and fuller. This is good, the complexity is very nice and it keeps you interested in each sip as you try and dissect the flavor components."
"Into a matching St Bernardus glass, pours a lovely mahogany, a thin film settled on top, a gentle swirl yields a splotchy bubbles, falling back to the ring around the top. The aroma is classic dubbel, dark fruits, nuts, faint spices. The taste first gave me the impression of too simple, but I just wasn't looking close enough. Its complex with subtleties. Figs and ripened fruits, more nuts, spicy hops, a bit earthy perhaps, bready, drying toward the end after a fullish body. Its quite the beer... probably not my favorite dubbel, but one I'll have to try again, get a larger bottle, and investigate even more closely."
"This is likely the lightest Belgian Dubbel I have ever had. Lightest in terms of colour, flavour, and mouthfeel. It poured up a reddish-orange-bronze colour, and quite honestly, was a bit lighter than I was anticipating. Smell was traditional Belgian yeast, some roasted cereal, and a bit of fresh fruit (pears and apples?). Taste was good, but not great. Again, toasted cereals and a bit of that metallic taste that is present in so many Belgians. Mouthfeel seemed a bit light for the style. This is certainly a full-bodied beer, but considering the style, I felt it was a bit on the lighter side. Overall, I don't think this is a bad beer; I simply feel that it is on the lighter side of a style that I personally prefer on the heavier side. I think this might make a good introduction beer for someone who is just starting to become interested in brews of this sort. I much prefer Prior 8."
"Pretty great dubbel. Definately a great representation of the style. This lives up to the hype. You can go wrong with anything from St Bernardus and this is no exception."
"The high-carbonation level of this beer transforms this into something better than it would be without it; acts simultaneously weighty, clingy, and spry on the mouth. Its quite angular and beautiful at the same time. Dark fruits and seltzer-y phenols make this addictive and quenching. The Bernardus line is just rock-solid."
"drinkability is good. this is a mild brew that goes down very smooth. however, the fruity character will not suit all drinker's tastes. overall a very well balanced and mild Belgian. a great starter beer into the wonderful world of Belgian brews. cheers!"
"Drinkability: 11.2oz is not enough... but dubbels aren't really my favorite so I wouldn't go around downing these. Certainly worth the acclaim and worth the purchase."
"Hazy, dark pour with a thick, bright, white head and a fair amount of retention. Complete with medium-bodied spices to complement the light body and thick texture. Fruity and aromatic with citrusy flavors that mellow on the finish. A solid beer that is probably too-often overlooked because of the other products to come from this brewery."
"Drinkability- Not my favorite style, but one of the top 5 I have had for sure. Maybe #3 behind Westvleteren and RR Benediction."
"D - This is a very good dubbel."
"Cola brown colored body with a off white colored head that was about 2 fingers worth.Nice soapy lacing on my glass.Poured into a Chimay chalice.Some sugar and pepper smells.I taste carmel,very clean taste and doesnt last long.Some chocolate in the taste also.Mouthful is very creamy and smooth and the carbonation is very inviting and almost not even there.This beer is one fine ass brew,its not somthing I would have daily but it isalong the lines of other trappist beers.Very delicate,and you can taste the different between belgian and usa brewed belgian beers.I think this beer was very fresh and wouldnt benefit from any aging.Thats just my opinion.The lacing becomes spider webby lacing at the end of the glass.Yeast floaties in the last pour."
"Poured into a chalice pours an amazing dark amber color with a frothy fluffy head that stays the entire time and leaves some nice thick fat lace. Smell is of fresh ripe fruits also has a bit of a roasted alcohol smell. Taste was a bit of a mess, first off I dont know if I had a dated bottle of it maybe harsh to the elements but, I can taste heavy carbonation with a bit of sweet molasses and also a bit of fruit in there as well, slight bit of hop bittereness and no alcohol detected. I am not sure if this was a bad bottle or not, I am going to get another one and compaire, other than that it wasn't bad but it wasn't great either."
"A truly superb beer and one I need to find on a regular basis."
"Exceptional drinkability, a great St. Bernardus with a modest alcohol content."
"Drinkability: A true gem. This can be a sipper or a session. A session for people who enjoy endulging in great Belgian beers"
"D - Tasty. It seems like a toned down version of the 8 with more carbonation."
"D: Bring em on! Could drink for a while, but this beer is filling."
"D: A nice beer, but the texture and mouthfeel make this one a bit difficult to drink for me."
"Another great offering from St. Bernardus...I actually prefer it to the Tripel."
"Bottle purchased at Bamber's in South Bend. Poured glowing crimson with a touch of terracotta. Huge white foaminess atop it. Looks pretty freaking brilliant. Smell is of a wet temperate forest with soil made of cumin, leaves of coriander and a little stream of alcohol flowing through it (funny how these trappist beers bring out the poets in us, huh?). Taste is a slightly chocolatey dubbel, not too heavy, some small spiciness but mostly just very smooth. Candi sugar and a light alcohol effervecense. Mouthfeel thin but pillowy...like a Dubbel Lite. Flatter than i expected. Very nice to drink. not all that strong so it doesn't hit too hard, and the flavor is very good."
"This brew pours out of the bottle a somewhat translucent dark color. The head was minimal and did not last long. The smell was a basic malty aroma as was the taste. Not much else going for the taste, at least on my palate. The mouth feel was ""wet"" and thin. This is a relatively rather unimpressive offering from this fine brewery, with Prior 8 being far superior to Pater 6."
"I poured this bottle into the St. Bernardus chalice that came with a 4 beer variety pack. Hazy chestnut body topped by a frothy head that lasts and lasts. Aroma is slightly spicy with a decent alcohol note. This is a familiar smell, but I can't place it (sorry). It's very appealing, though. Flavor has a good bit of a ""beer"" flavor. This beer really changes as it warms. Aroma becomes sweeter - more fruity and complex. Yeast starts to fade away. Back to the flavor - very dry, slightly bitter. Has a bit of a French baguette note. More sweetness and cooked fruit notes come through. Mouthfeel is thin, with prickly carbonation. This doesn't seem to change. Drinkability is OK. I like the tripel much better. For $14 for the Pater (6), Prior (8), Abt (12), Tripel, and the chalice, I think its one of the best bargains going."
"Creamy mouthfeel with a come-hither finish (slightly sweet but with just enough hop bite to cleanse the palate). I'm just glad that I didn't give up beer for Lent. This is an excellent example of a secular dubbel, and at 6.7% ABV , a substantial, nourishing treat."
"At first I was a bit reluctant to buy this. It was right next to the 8 and 12 and about the same price- both (especially the 12) tops on my list of favorites. I would look at it and then grab the Quad. I almost passed thinking it would be an average abbey brown. Boy am I glad I gave this a second look."
"Drinkability: Highly drinkable. Offers fine flavor, combined with other sensually pleasing elements. St. B lives up to its reputation for world-class craftsmanship."
"Very hazy brown color and a nice beige two finger head, crusty and retains well. Fruity malt nose with a fair amount of floral hop character. Profile is of nice fruity malt and hop combo that drifts from sweet-sour to smokey, dark dried fruits. Consistent notes of caramel, oak, raisons, and nutty. Adding to the depth are hops providing some slight bittering and acidic citric character in the background. Full bodied, medium-high carbonation, and a thin mouthfeel that's start off too fizzy but smoothes out as it warms. The finish is rather mild with some dry, sweet bread and lingering roastiness. Very good beer...St. Bs never disappoints."
"I didn't need to drink this beer to convince myself that Brouwerij St. Bernardus is one of the best breweries in the world. My experiences with St. Bernardus Witbier and Grotten Brown were proof enough of that. While it can't touch the absolute masterpiece that is Westvletern 8, nothing can. Pater 6 is a beautifully crafted Belgian dubbel that belongs on any list of the world's best."
"Mouthfeel is fine. Carbonation is not a problem, nor is the alcohol. Drinkability is likewise quite nice. Not a bad beer, but my least favortie out of the St Bernardus line."
"Poured from the 330ml bottle into a St. Bernardus glass. Body is burnt siena with orange highlights, topped by a half inch of creamy stark white head. Light aroma of moderately sweet malt and a touch of spicy Belgian yeast and coriander. Palate is a bit more assertive -sweet Belgian dark malt with notes of coriander and caramel. Body is light and airy, a bit too delicate for the amount of flavor in the beer. Sip carefully to avoid making the active carbonation too foamy in the mouth. Overall, a nice, fairly light Belgian ale that goes down pretty easy."
"After a sub par poor into a St. Bernardus glass, I appreciated the off white head and deep amber color of this monk-made beer. A slightly congested nose kept me from smelling much, but what I did smell was balanced. The beer tastes excellent with a velvety feeling on the tongue and a sour aftertaste that I can't quite pin down. The hops are not overbearing and the malts dance with them on your tongue."
"Drinkability takes a bit of a hit because the alcohol comes through and its a bit much for the abv."
"St. Bernardus Pater 6 pours a deep, dark copper with an off white head from a brown 11.2 ounce bottle which was carefully decanted. The aroma is excellent, I get cherries and chocolate as my impression. The yeast really hits me first in the flavor. A sweet maltiness is also noticeable. Some fruity notes and some nutty flavors are also present. Very easy to drink."
"Muddy brown in my St. Bernardus Watou glass. Dense off-white head. Lots of lacing. Smells and tastes very sweet like all St. B beers. Spicy & nutty with a little bitterness at the end. Mouthfeel is thick and sticky, not heavy on alcohol. Carbonation is a bit too heavy though."
"M: Light and bubbly mouthfeel... glides though the mouth very easily. This lends to excellent drinkability... I like this one a lot!!!"
"D: Seldom are we treated to something so close to perfect. This beer fits together like a puzzle. Everthing (A, S, T, M, & D) perfectly compliments each other and takes it to the next level. I mean, come on! This one is even a joy to look at! One of the finest Dubbels out there and probably my 2nd favorite example of the style (right behind Prior 8)."
"Served in a St. Bernardus chalice, the beer pours a brownish/red color, with a small off-white head. It smells like caramel, roasted malt, vanilla and cloves. It tastes like it smells, except I can also taste pepper (spice), dark fruit and a bit of banana. It starts off sweet, and has a tart finish. Mouthfeel is a bit slick and smooth, and also nice and crisp. It also has a lot of carbonation. Drinkability is good too, it's very easy to drink. I think this is a pretty good beer, I'd definitely recommend it to others."
"Served at cellar temperature."
"33cL bottle from A-1 to-go in Gardiner. Dark brown body with almost an inch of off-white head and ruby-red highlights. Smells roasty malty, kind of caramelly. Aroma is a bit light though. Tastes fruity, roasty, with some caramel and just a hint of chocolate. Some peatiness toward the finish. On the upper side of medium-bodied with some carbonation, but not too much. Wow. This beer is fantastic. One of the best Dubbels I've ever had."
"Another world-class beer from this brewery. The yeast works wonders as the malts and hops back it up. The look and feel are perfect and add to the magic."
"Purchased a four pack, which include the 6, 8 ,tripel, quad and Watou goblet at whole foods again Kim rocks. Poured perfectly into goblet thick white head that dissipates to an inch or so with little lacing and moderate retention. The body is a muddy red brown. Sort of like a muddy river with reddish soil. Smells of fruit apple, pear, Belgian rock candy and yeasty goodness. The taste, crisp medium body not very sweet or syrupy, the hops give it a nice subtle balance with a dry yeasty/light fruit finish. This is very drinkable, something I could see being a good cheese companion. Maybe some bread and fruit, a nice midday or lunch time beer. This is absolutely a great drink not over the top, or aggressive, just the right amount of balance and flavor to make a very drinkable beer, you can eat with and enjoy with out feeling taken over. How ever it is not something I'd normally drink on its own. I feel like its a beer made for food. I think with food this beer would be totally excellent. Give it a try. St. Bernardus you know whats up."
"Drinkability: Very good, a great example of the style from one of the world's great breweries."
"Overall: Text"
"Drinkability: This is a damn good beer. Alcohol isn't particularly evident, in the mouth or in the head, which left me wanting more and more. Dubbels aren't exactly the Rolls Royce of beers; they are more like a solid Honda that rides smooth for 200,000 miles. Pater 6 is an excellent example of a dubbel, and one that I will sample frequently."
"D - One of the better St Bernardus offerings I have had to date. I don't think I will bother with it in the future though. It is one of the driest, most bitter dubbels I have ever had. It is good with foods, better than most dubbels, but it doesn't stand on its own as well as many of the better dubbels do."
"Drinkability: A very tasty and complex dubbel. The flavors really come out more as the beer warms( naturally) , so resist the urge to quaff this pleasant drink."
"Slainte!"
"Probably just about the first dubbel I've ever thought of keeping around on a regular basis, since it's just so drinkable. Tasty stuff."
"Drinkability is great. This beer is very flavorful without overloading the palate. A very enjoyable treat that is easily consumed."
"Pours an amberish color with crimson highlights. A tight creamy tan head rests atop. Aroma is very nice with lots of dark fruits and sweeter malts. Some Belgian yeasty notes as well. They should sell this in candles. Taste begins malty with figs and plums at the forefront. Yeast and spices come out after. They're a bit too strong and ride out the dark fruits. A raisiny character shows in the back. Finish is lighter in sweetness but almost chocolatey and with a touch of alcohol. Very inviting for another sip. In fact this bottle went too quickly. I could enjoy many of these if not for the price. The creamy body and malty yet not overly sweet flavors makes the mouthfeel excellent. I'd like to try this on tap."
"Drinkability: Perhaps the easiest of the Abts to drink; their is plenty going on but you have to look for it"
"D: The depth is not as pronounced as 8 or 12, big surprise, but the ale is very good nonetheless."
"Pours a nice thick creamy head (as all ST. B's) and the beer itself is a deep amber brown. The nose is light, but there are notes of smoke, roasted malts, and fruit. The taste has a malty sweetness with a smooth chocolate and fruit rounding out the flavor with a light coffee finish. The malt and alcohol compete at the end of each sip keeping one's palette guessing. The mouthfeel is full and round ... it really matches the full flavor of this beer. As all of St. B's styles, this one is just as easy to drink. A phenomenal beer worth savoring!"
"All in all, this is a darn good beer and I am glad they put the 6/8/trippel and 12 together in this box with the chalice. Nice box for 16 bucks.!"
"Heres a deep mahogany colored brew, capped with a dense floating tan foam. Beautiful lace. The aroma is intense with caramel, bread, yeast, raisins, pepper, dark sugar, and malt. Its a beautiful smell. The taste is rich and malty, with just a slight sweetness and even slighter alcohol quality. Well crafted, with each piece coming together like a perfectly fitted puzzle. I love the way a great beer plays off its own qualities. The mouthfeel is full and creamy, with a modest spiciness to prevent it from becoming sticky. The finish lingers, and is a little sweet, with some herbalness. In quantity, the brew could become overly sweet, but in single bottle servings, its very pleasant. This is a wonderful brew."
" This is something I could easily drink on a regular basis."
"Less than 7%? Wow, this is complex. My St. Bernardus chalice was loving the Abt's younger brother. If 12 and 8 are too much for you, try this little guy. They can't brew a bad one in Watou. Get that great Abbey taste with less alcohol, the closest thing St. Bernie's comes to a session beer."
"Quite an interesting one with the combination of grassy hops and faint tartness cleaning up the palate and that hint of butterscotch I pick up. A solid example of one of my favorite styles."
"Slightly citric fruit profile with a bready body. Very vibrant presence on the palate. Slightly bitters as the drink ends. Quite tasty. I don't think this brewery is capable of producing a bad beer."
"All in all, this proves St. Bernardus to be one of the world's most consistently great breweries. It's easy to be an optimist when you're drinking Pater 6...the goblet is half full. I hate to think of it any other way."
"11.2oz bottle poured into my St. Bernardus chalice. Pours a deep reddish brown with a nice light tan head. Aroma is yeasty bread, raisens, and dark fruits. My mouth starts watering just from the smell. Taste is malty with a bready dough flavor and some chocolate that finishes with a perfectly integrated hop bitterness. There is also some warming from the alcohol as it goes down. Overall, this is a wonderful beer. I am amazed that they can make a beer so complex with only 6.7% ABV. Another great brew from an absolutely outstanding brewery."
"A bit too much carbonation for me..that's really the only thing about this beer that isn't stellar. Simply another great Trappist brew."
"Tasted a bit like a brown ale to me. For the higher abv., it's quite refreshing. Pours into the chalice a bubbly brown, with a half finger of thick foam. Smells sweet, with cherries, malts, toast, crackers, figs and plums. Taste was a little lighter than expected, but still good. Starts off sweet, with the fruits dominating. Afterwards, it's a bit dry. Mouthfeel is a little dry and heavy. Not thick, but heavy. Deceptive as well. One could drink this all day, until one tries to stand up."
"Mouthfeel is medium, not real heavy, quite drinkable. My impression is of an abbey ale with training wheels -- not to imply it is lesser, by any means -- but without the depth and complexity of its higher-ABV bretheren. I may like it even better this way."
"Poured into a Duvel tulip glass. The beer poured a deep brown shade with an off white head. The nose of this fine beer gave hints of a toasted malt backbone along with some notes of citrus, raisins and spices. The taste had a nice touch of malty sweetness along with touches of orange and lemon on the tongue. Refreshing. After all these tastes, there was a bit of hop character that rounded everything out. The body of the beer is well carbonated and easy to drink."
"Overall a very good beer that I will definitely drink again. A little heavy to have more than one or two."
"Nicely drinkable and quite heady. All around quite a nice beer."
"Opinion: This beer is super nice, and yet another fabulous offering from this brewery. I have never been disappointed in any of their beers, and so I didn't hesitate for a second to pick this one up when I saw it at Central Market in Austin. This particular beer is like a session beer for this brewery, and it is dangerously drinkable and goes down really smooth. I would definitely drink this beer again."
"Pours a dark, opaque garnet with a spotty skim of tan head in a beautiful St. Bernie's chalice. Nose is predominately of Belgian yeast, bracketed by an earthy fruitiness - rather subdued for a dubbel. Taste is dominated by a doughy maltiness and a rather pronounced metallic bite, with a spicy apple-cinnamon, plum, and mild vinuous finish. Mouthfeel is medium and lightly carbonated. Quite a drinkable dubbel, light in nose and palate, but the light fruitiness that I enjoy in a good dubbel was muted by the astringent metallic bite."
"Good dubbel...mabe great"
"Overall, a little on the bland side, but the more I drank of it, the more I started to enjoy it."
"To start, let me say the best way to enjoy a beer is out the glassware designed by the brewery of the aforementioned beer. Secondly, it's a damn shame I didn't buy more of this because it seems like it would pair with more food than you can shake a stick at. St. B is the shit."
"D - Very drinkable indeed."
"Drinkability - cost aside, a fine session dubbel at a reasonable abv."
"This is a decent dubbel, but not the best dubbel around, for that it doesn't have enough 'street credibility', if you catch my drift."
"While dubbels are seldom my choice of styles...this is a superb offering worthy of many revisits."
"Overall - A very good beer.... Recommended..."
"This is a very smooth beer, and the only knock to its drinkability is its strength (although if I didn't have to work tomorrow, I could certainly knock back a few)."
"This was a nice and easy beer but a little dry for a dubbel."
"Another winner from SB. Can they do no wrong?! Compared to Prior 8 (another dubbel from SB), this one seemed sweeter but with less dark fruit taste."
"drinkability - very good, really similar tasting to their abt 12, but not quite as huge and deep, but with less alcohol presence as well. great mouthfeel. if your into belgians you cant go wrong with this one. an excellent example of its style. those monks make a quality drink for sure."
"Presentation: Packaged in an 11.2 ounce brown glass bottle with a pop-off crown, served in a St. Bernardus goblet."
"DThis is a great beer. Still a sipper, but 2 more are not out of the question."
"."
"A truly excellent Dubbel."
"Sweet malts, but not the kind that annoy, more the kind that are deep, rich, dark. The richness comes from a dark fruitiness. Mouthfeel comes through with a rising aggressive point towards the end, sharp, somewhat cloying sweetness. Bananna, hop bitterness is mild. For a dubbel it comes across a bit watered. Very tasty."
"Ruby red/brown, small tan head of foam that lasts, forever! Aromas of dark malts, melding with complex spices, nuts, and dark fruits. Taste is heavy considering how light this is in abv and mouthfeel when compared to the other ST. B. offerings. Taste is nutty and complex with malt and fruit overtones, also even a bit of leather, tobacco, and smoke in there as well. Nice and earthy too. Drinkability remains good with the low abv, and amazing character. Certainly good, pushing towards very good with age, and excellent with a lot of time..."
"Pours out very nice, but leaves a very small head, however the lacing is very strong. It's very dark and ruby red with purple. The smell is nice and flowery at first, but then was coverd by a grainy smell. The taste is a little more balanced and as it warms the balance equals out. The mouthfeel is very smooth."
"St. Bernardus is simply incapable of producing a bad beer, or an average beer, or even a very good beer. Their beers are as flawless as you get. Pater 6 is no exception. It starts off with a serios fruity-sweet, tart, spicy aroma. The thinly viscous pour forms a rocky head with spices floating about. Flavors are everywhere from cherries and banannas to dates and figs. Nuts and musk to peaches and pears. Candied sweetness to berry tartness. Completely enjoyed in the round. Very complex and smooth. Moderately dense texture with increasingly creaminess and smoothness. Finishes dry and sweet. Alcohols intertwine with sweetness for a heat with low inpact. Terrific brew. An instant favorite."
"This is one terrific ""little"" beer. I hadn't had the opportunity to try this until Total Wine began stocking it recently. As expected, quite similar to the 8, but this one is probably even better to have with food. Dark, sweet, fruity dubbel - very high drinkability. In a perfect world, this would be what ""light beer"" would be. A toned down (ABV) version of a great beer!"
"Medium to full bodied, the carbonation stays present throughout, it just cant escape the clutches of this brew. Even though its a 6.7%abv, no alcohol overkill, this is sip-able for the long haul  kinda pricey for 6 or more bottles, but what da heck."
"This blows most other dubbels that Ive tasted away."
"In spite of my disappointment, this is still a good beer. I just doesn't measure up to, say, Westmalle Dubbel in my opinion. But it's still a tasty treat and true to the style."
"This is a fairly good beer. It isnt that complex, but it is a respectable beer for a change of pace. Slightly expensive and not as good as the other offerings from this brewery, but still a first-rate brew."
"Quite possibly the best Dubbel I've ever tasted. I've always been more of a tripel/quadrupel fan, but this beer could convert me. Pours a rich brown color, with a frothy white head. Nose is soft and sweet. Flavor is amazing; much lighter than most dubbels I've tried, but in no way bland or simple. Actually a fairly sweet, fruity flavor. The beer drinks incredibly easily, with no hint of alcohol. Another winner from Saint Bernardus."
"Hightly enjoyable, can't think of many beers which set such a good example as this one does. Seek it out and sit on the most comfortable chair you own and you will realize that your mouth is getting the better treatment, not your ass."
"THE BLOODHOUND FACTOR: Peaches wasn't in the beer mood, but Benji was highly excited by this dark liquid beer treat. I think both him and I have found a new top 5 beer."
"11.2 oz bottle best by 8/8/08 poured into the St. Bernardus chalice, a mammoth 3 fingers of head almost overflowing the glass, a plummish ruby colored body, nice retention, some scattered curtains of lace. Nose is full of yeast, with a slight sweet malt, a fruity plumlike hint, and a slight nuttiness. Taste is a delicious cookie-like malt, hints of almonds, hazelnut, cocoa, all infused with a fresh yeast and clove spice. Very nice tasting. Medium bodied with a fairly light carbonation and a rather smooth feel. This is one hell of a tasty beer, St. Bernardus is making some of the best Belgian beer in the world, and unlike most this has a reasonably low alcohol content and so can be drank in quantity."
"Pours a deep brown, with a monster of a head that lingers for a long while. Smell is of fruits, citrusy and complex with a wonderful aroma of belgian yeast. Taste is fruity, tart, raisiny, slightly spicy, and phenolic. Good balance of both sweet and sour. Flavor is well rounded, not real bitter though. It has a light to medium thickness, is very smooth with great carbonation/bubbles. I could drink it all night..."
"Into my new chalice with a heavy pour give a perfect beer with great head that last forever and lacing all the way down. A little light brown body with a tan head. The smell was jumping out of the glass and had lots of fruityness and even a touch of hops in the background all surrounded by the malt sweetness. Large fruit taste that reminds me of Gala apples with a slight citrus twang with lots of malt. A little thin in the mouth at times almost watery. Very drinkable and I would have one any time."
"If I had more of these, I would most likely get into some trouble tonight due to the amount I would drink with such ease. Tangy and carbonated mouthfeel with a light to medium body make this very drinkable."
"Easy drinking and tasty, though the flavors are slightly restrained compared to the aroma."
"Very easy to consume. Non-threatening. The half-empty view would be it is weak & wimpy.I'll take the half-full view: An enjoyable, easy to approach dubbel that would be a great introduction for the uninitiated."
"Small bottle, label says this one will be good till 080808....pours A soft shade of medium chocolaty brown, fairly clar, moderate tan head and so so lacing. Mellow nose of chocolate, light powdered sugar. This is a very soft, subtle, understated Belgian Dubbel. Smooth cookie notes midway and in the finish. Honey, vanilla, smoke, more cookie dough. Never aggressive in its approach, Those crafty monks..."
"11.2 ounce bottle. St. Bernardus 6 pours out a hazy dark brown color with a huge head. Yeasty bread aroma with caramel, fruit, nuts, and spice. Biscuity malt flavor with carmel. Lots of spice flavors, with nutmeg the most pronounced. Interestingly, there is very little sweetness. In fact, this beer is pretty bitter. Sort of a grassy taste in the finish. So smooth and drinkable, this 11.2 ounce bottle is simply not enough. I was sad when I neared the bottom of the glass. I really enjoy the complex flavors in this great beer."
"Unremarkable."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable, I wish I had more than this one bottle. Everything turned out nearly perfect with this brew."
"Bottle: Poured a dark brown color ale with a huge off-white foamy head. Aroma of sweet raisins with the distinctive Belgian yeast. Taste can also be distinguished by the sweet malt and raisins with a candy like sweetness also present. Body is a bit too thin but carbonation is quite good. Another fine beer from a great brewery."
"Dark brown with burnt sienna highlights, nice creamy and thick head -- even in an open chalice. Great sheets of complicated lace. Sweet aromas with molasses and pleasant wine-like qualities. Mouthfeel is light with nicely even and lively carbonation. Flavors are very well-composed but not excessively strident, prune and cherry, white chocolate, and bare yeast expression. Lightens and becomes more leafy with an interesting balancing dryness in the second half (unusual for a typical Dubbel). This brew doesn't bowl you over but its exceptionally drinkable with a fruity but not intimidating profile. Airy underpinnings. Its characteristics showing a light astringency are unusual and very nice."
"Pours a hazy orange/brown into my Westvleteren chalice, big off white head forms, very sticky lace all over the glass. Smell is very rich and malty, vinous, with some spice, caramel, chocolate and iron notes. Taste is delicious, cherries, chocolate, spice, iron, some alcohol, little coffee and yeast. Mouthfeel is smooth and butter, perfect carbonation, medium bodied. Fantastic beer."
"This is just sublime. I would drink it in in a box, with stinky socks, and Mr. Fox ... not just drinkable because it's good, however. It's also refreshing and not an overpowering ABV, and you can either dwell on the tastes or just close your eyes and smile. One of the best I've had."
"The is an excellent Dubbel, one of the best Ive had. It has lighter fruit flavor than I expected and its packed with complexity."
"Certainly doesn't seem like a light-weight!"
"This is one of the best by my favorite Belgian monk, St. Bernardus! If you can get your hands on it, I highly recommend it. Low ABV for the style, but still packs a punch with some great complex flavors."
"Murky toffee with reddish highlights. Generous tan head composed of fine bubbles that reduces somewhat, but doesn't disappear, and leaves a solid film of bubbles stuck to my goblet. Bready, yeasty aroma backed up by an herbal cola-like quality and ripe plums/dried fruit. Chocolate maltiness initially dominates the flavour, followed by doughiness and light raisin that carries into the finish. The flavours are quite delicate and light, superb balance. There's a hint of alcohol warmth in the finish, but it's very subtle, and it's only slightly drying at the end. Light body that never feels thin; moderately high carbonation that is far from harsh or coarse, and contributes greatly to texture. I can't believe how easy this is to drink. It's not overly complex, but still has plenty going on and what's there is balanced very well. Definitely a winner."
"I wish it was easier to find this in Columbus. I can easily find the ABT 12 or the tripel from St. Bernardus, but the Pater 6 and Prior 8 are difficult to get in 12oz bottles. I bought this in MN last week."
"This brew pours a solid brown color with a huge off white head. The aroma is wonderful. Spicy and malty. The taste is rather disappointing. There are some nice spices, but no real backbone. It is not a bad taste, but it could be a lot better. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a lot of carbonation. Overall, this is a pretty good brew, but I would prefer Prior 8 over Pater 6 anyday."
"Drinkability is great with this classic Belgian dubbel."
"It's gaseous and downable and ultimately a better dubbel than 8."
"as it warms, the malt leads to a cascading red berry tartness with equal sweet. almost criticized the carbonation, but with a minute or two this beer calms and miniscule bubbles add to the silkiness, they don't make this excessively perky. warm beer finishes with a sugar smack and sweet pipe tobacco. dare i say, the first perfect beer i've come in contact with. dare i say."
"It has a beautiful mouthfeel, frothy and smooth and delightful. Don't be put off by my noting all the cookies, cola and candy. There's enough bitterness to define all these flavors and make it all work. Fabulous brew."
"The pour is into a chalice with a large tan foamy head. The dark molasses color is brilliant. The aroma is sweet candi sugar and chocolate malt. The taste is also sweet candi sugar and a sweet malt backbone. This thinner version of their Abt 12 is a great session brew; if your session doesn't good more than 3 deep! A nice dessert ale to end a night cap."
"Overall Impression: A very tasty beer. Not as intense as its big brothers, but its nice to have the option of enjoying a small version of those bad boys. Ill be stocking up on some of these. Recommended!"
"Another great beer from the folks at St. Bernardus. Doesn't quite knock me on my ass like their others, but that can be a good thing."
"BB 25-06-07. Great lasting head leaving laces and dark brown beer. Nose is spicy as all the bernardus beers, peppered malts with next to that good fruityness with bannana & plumb and this all abthing in a caramellic candysauce. Taste is also great with best maltyness, full bodied but not sweet, spicyness and a nice a quiet dry and bitter aftertaste. Great& full mouthfeel, especially regarding the ""only"" 6% of alcohol. Good carbonisation and dry aftertaste ask for more of this great brew."
"Very good abbey beer!"
"Obtained from John's Grocery (Iowa City) in May 2005 and consumed later that week. Freshness nnotching on the bottom of the label is 1349, and I think it says best comsumed by 2004 in several languages on the right and left sides of the label. Pours a 2 finger light-tan and fluffy head over a brown-bronze muddy liquid. Sweet caramel and candi-sugar smells arose during the pour. Smells nutty and sweet of caramel and almost bock-like. Noticable alcohol wakes my nose-hairs. Tastes of dark fruit, very wet sweet, chocolate, fudge, and hazelnut. A small amount of funk late comes across as some kind of chocolate-covered green-vegetable. Kind of odd, but actually not unpleasant. There is so much here in the way of flavor that I wouldn't be surprised if newspaper taxis appeared on the shore. The aftertaste rising in my throat is alcohol and rock candy. Rock candy, now that stirs fond memories. Still quite a bit of head hanging around and the chocolate is coming out more as it warms, albeit a bit drier than before. Thick mouthfeel and sharply carbonated, as to produce a sting across a good portion of my tongue. Definitely a lighter version of the Abt 12, but with many similarities. I highly recommend this beer."
"St. Bernie makes some outstanding brews, but this one lacks the complexity others have when it comes to taste."
"Taste is much like the nose. Spicy and a bit peppery or a gingery bite to it. Fruity apple flavors and grainy. Dryish too, which is odd. Some hops if the finish and aftertaste and a little thin in the mouth compared to the general flavor explosion. Really tasty and drinkable. Does the happy monk do anything wrong? Not even a favorite style of mine and they still knocked my socks off. Highly recommended."
"This is a pretty nice Abbey and has a wonderful aroma, but I wished it had a touch more sweetness to really accentuate the fruits and bring out the aromatic complexities. I'd go for the Abt 12 over this one. Good brew!"
"Pours a poopie brown color with little light around the edges. There is relatively no head, and only a little bit of carbonation effervescing from the bottom of the glass. Smell is very inviting, much like nuts with a touch of fruit... apricots mostly. The taste is almost perfect. The same hint of apricots is in there, but there is a malty sweetness that seamlessly follows it all down. The little bit of carbonation leaves a dry finish and rinses the whole taste down, which warrants another sip. Good thing it comes in such a small bottle at a large price, or I would drink it all the time!"
"I'm going to have to make this beer a more intimate part of my life, and keep it well at hand, for anytime I need a jolt of delight and deliciousness."
"Texture is smooth and creamy with a medium body carried by medium bubbles of active carbonation"
"D- very nice dubbel but not as complex as some. A beautiful beer that has nice maltyness and alcohol warmth"
"Drinkability and Overall: This beer is not too incredibly different from the Prior 8, but it does have some qualities that make it unique. The powerful sweetness is the most important. This, like all the other St. Bernardus beers, is a wonderful beer. You can't go wrong with St. Bernardus!!!"
"Beer pours a dark, murky redish/orange with a good size white head. Great retention. It's in a St. Bernardous glass, always a plus. Nice malty aroma, oranges, little bit of alcohol. Taste is great, nice and sweet, some cloves. It's not very complex, but it's very good. No bitterness to speak of. Mouthfeel is crisp and light, good amount of carbonation, slightly dry finish. Drinkability is great. It's not a very intense brew, so a couple in one sitting or a whole 750 isn't out of the question."
"Ruby color, 2-finger foamy head goes down slowly leaving some lacing. Aromas were vinous and reminiscent of chocolate. Taste at first was peppery which yielded to bittersweet liquid chocolate. Mouthfeel was smooth and tingly, dry and slightly bitter in the aftertaste. Not a bad beer at all."
"Final Thought: This is an exceptional ale that may be the best of all that are available from this world-famous brewery."
"Rich brew, long and dry finish. Refreshingly drinkable. Liked the brown colour, the bubbles in the yeast, the lace; the spicy aroma. Unique smoothness.Two years' later bottle showed great lace, spicy aroma, and good easy drinking. Marvelous brewery."
"The taste was kind of malty, but well balanced. Tasted very similar to the Prior 8 or ABT12, but somewhat watered down in comparison, especially to the latter. I would definately recommend trying one of the above (or the tripel) instead of this, though this is still an excellent brew for those who must have it all."
"it tastes deliciously nutty and bready with some dark fruit and spice. nothing overpowering, but really great. the finish is of tart dried fruits. mouthfeel is very agreeable and soft"
"11.2oz bottle. Pours a brown color with a very tall head and good retention and leaves lots of lacing on the glass. The aroma is very spicy with some fruit notes thrown in there. The flavor is spicy like the nose, but is has some banana, clove, raisin in there. Drinkability is very good and the body is right where I like it."
"This beer pours a fairly plain brown with an enoumoust billowing head that doesn't want to let me at the beer underneath. The nose is very pleasant. The nose is really spiey with a light raisin and caramel in there. I like it. The flavor is very good. Raisins, banana and spices dance across a stage of caramel sweetness. The feel is right at moderate, with a velvety smooth feel. Drinkability is also good on this one. I think this is a solid brew from start to finish."
"Overall, this isn't as rich and heavy as the St. bernardus 8 or 12, as expected, but to me that's not a bad thing. This is easier to enjoy for me with no guit, because I know I can be mentally functioning during and after enjoying this lovely beer. I have to admit that overall I like the 8 better, but this one has a lot going for it! Highly recommended!"
"Overall, this is a very nice dubbel, one I'd happily drink again."
"Murky brown color with a creamy tan head. The aroma is malty, bready, slightly nutty with hints of dark fruits. It is also slightly astringent. The flavor is malty and toasty with hints of dark fruits. It has a nice malty sweetness throughout. Light in body and smooth drinking. A very nice dubbel."
"This trappist poured a medium brown with tight light tan foam and loads of nice tan lace that clinged to the sides of the glass. The smell was of a hop's and malts filled the nose. The taste was of layers of soft malts and hops that made this trappist pleasant to the mouth and palate. The warmer this trappist got, the more intense and complex the flavor!"
"An absorbant dark mahogany tone. Don't see much UV getting through. Big fucking crop of white head. Fluffy, pillowy, airy... Damn nice to look at. Lace coats the whole damn glass. Great nose of bubblegum, candy, yeast and wet grass. Quite a sweet taste. Bubblegum is pretty high in the mix. Rock candy. Yeasty doughiness. Subtle malt sweetness. An upper echelon Belgian brew. Mouthfeel is very forgiving. Gentle and soothing. A little airy and lofty. Really nice. Overall, a very impressive dubbel."
"Tastes are just as becoming as the wonderful display of aromas, soft and well rounded with the perfect carbonation that sits slightly dry quickly getting drier but never overly so with notes of the chocolate, berries, cherries, yeast, and lemon cookie crumbs. Quite a treat that remains smooth and inviting the whole way through. Complexing, subtle, and yummy. Super drinkable as it is beyond the threshold of any normal beer. Yet is thee calling card of the St. Bernardus line of yummy delightful treats. Drink and be merry just like the monk on the label. No wonder he looks so happy, he gets to drink this stuff everyday. Good stuff!"
"33 cl bottle. A darn nice, complex beer with quite a bit going on. the hop presence was interesting and added to the complexity. For only a 6.7%ABV beer, there was quite an alcoholic warming effect, the alcohol didn't hide in the background."
"St. Bernardus is by far my favorite beer line. However I had never had the 6. For some reason very few places carry it. I found a 12 oz bottle at the Whole Foods in Vienna, VA and decided to give it a whirl. First appearance is murky brown with a good two fingers of head that won't quit. Aroma is fruity, woody, and sweet. Taste is very well balanced... creamy, a little fruity with ripe fruits, figs, etc. A touch fizzy in the mouth, but it goes away with a little oxidation. Not as good as the 12, but I like it better than the 8."
"Pours a cloudy chestnut with a thick and fluffy tan head when poured into the large St. B chalice. Earthy aromas, tree bark, sweet hay, wet wood. Smells like it could have a slight tartness to it, but it does not. Dulled sweet malt with an earthiness that shines like a Scottish ale. Faint husky astringency. Reasonably thin in the mouthfeel while maintaining a good drinkability. Very nice brew."
"Reddish brown pour with a foamy white head that is quite short lived. The lacing is moderate. The nose is malty with a flowery sweetness and a musty earthy yeastiness. Taste is quite delicate and sweet with roasted dark malt, brown sugar, raisins, and bitter to spicy hops, which are supplemented by a dusty dry yeast strain. The alcohol presence is a lot stronger than anticipated for a 6.5% ABV brew. The mouthfeel however is quite watery and hollow. I am coming to a conclusion, that among the Belgian style beers, Dubbles are the least favorite of mine. This is not a knock on this beer. The style just doesnt light me up."
"I opened the bottle and did not pour it right away. Foam was coming out of the bottle. Poured this into a glass and had a beautiful thick one inch head and the lace is beautiful. Nose is dark fruit and molasses. Taste is just a tad watery but there is figs, prunes and molasses. A little fizzy and bubbly. Does not have the extended aftertaste that some other good Belgians do. I am somewhat dissappointed because the appearance and nose are exceptional. This is still an excellent beer."
"A relatively light Belgian, thanks to its low alcohol. Starts deep with spice and chewy caramel, but ends up almost foamy and airy, which is an interesting sensation. While it is not my favorite St. Bernardus ale, it is a very decent, well-crafted Belgian beer. I could have a couple with no difficulty and, I suspect, with a grin."
"Of the St. Bernadus family, I think the 8 strikes the best balance between drinkability and complexity, but the 6 is still incredible. St. Bernadus can't make a bad beer. Seek this one out and enjoy it: the little brother of the family is still a big, big beer."
"Highly Recommended."
"Thick, airy, oatmeal colored head that holds solid. The aroma is fairly tangy, a bit lemony up front, and mellows quickly. The beer is opaque, oak brown in color. Creamy, malty, nutty taste with a mild hop bite in the middle that fades quick resulting in a pretty clean finish. Overall a pretty mild beer, nice combination of aroma and flavor. I would drink it more often if it were more available."
"Drinkability: A nice simple, yet tasty, beer. It's eclipsed by its brethren higher up in the clerical foodchain, though. Definitely worth getting for comparison to Abt 12 and Prior 8."
"The little brother of the Abt 12 and the Prior 8. Great looking beer, as all of them are. Big creamy beige head that stays well and leaves lace in big sheets that slowly slide away down the glass leaving many patches. Underneath that is a tasty looking dark brown brew. Aroma of candy sugar and spices, a bit peppery. Hints of caramel malt. Caramel malt on the tongue with a defined peppery spice in a wide area around the middle. Clove is present as well. Dark fruits are all around, but subtle. Yeastiness is here and there. Great thick mouthfeel, a good full body. Excellent! This seems to be the session beer of the St. Bernardus clan, if there is one. I hope I can find the 750 ml bottles of this. Highly recommended!"
"i still wonder how old this bottle is...it is adorned with a blue label with a very happy looking monk holding a a schooner of brew. it is labeled ""st. sixtus"" with a yellow bottle cap labeled ""st. bernadus pater 6"""
"Appearance: Deep mahogany tone with a silky smooth tan head leaves nice thick patches of Belgian lacing. Aroma: Tart apples, raisin with dark roasted malts and a wonderful ginger bread sweetness this one is nice. Taste: Nice soft flavors with a doughy characteristic underlying fruit esters and chocolate traces trickle through the flavor of this fine abbey dubbel. Mouthfeel: Silky smooth medium bodied ale, awesome carbonation spritzy but not over carbonated. Drinkability: A unique dubbel in my opinion flavors blend incredibly well a great overall example of the style, good stuff."
"11.2 oz bottle with suggestions in Flemish and French to consume before end of 2004. Pours into a St Bernardus goblet a deep chestnut brown with a billowy head and massive lacing. Nose is cloves, coriander, allspice, with some dark fruits in the background. Taste is divine, with tart apples, caramel sweetness, well balanced with subtle spicy hop notes and a hint of yeast. Simply an excellent ale, finishing with a dry, spicy, peppery fruitiness. Complex and supremely well balanced."
"Immediately reminded me of Grotten Brown. Well integrated and methodical flavor madness. Ripe fruits, sugared pecans, brown sugar. Kind of the terrier of the dog world, thinking that it's bigger than it is. And really, it lives up. Caramel, yeast, fruit, etc. Very deep, very tasty. Packs more wallop than one might expect for a comparitively ""small"" beer. I think I underrated Grotten; that was much better than this, even as superb as this is."
"This is another fantastic beer fron St Bernardus. Although lacking the body and complexity of it's big brothers, the Prior 8 and Abt 12, this little brew manages to stand on it's own as a top example of a Belgian Dubbel."
"Dark brown with plenty of fluffy tan head. The generous carbonation brings out the aroma of sweet breads and dark fruits. When I took the first sip I was amazed. Sweet and malty with chocolate, plums, caramel and berries. Wonderfull balance, very crisp and dry. Outstanding."
"This beer pours a deep reddish copper color when held up to the light, otherwise it is a deep amber color. It is lightly hazy and is topped by a creamy off white head. The aroma is slightly musty, complex and spicy to boot. A definite spicy brew. The carbonation tingles on my tongue as it goes down. This beer is fairly dry though there is a slight sweetness here. A hint of alcohol character is in the finish. I get hints of bergamot, ginger, pepper and caramel, as well as a bunch of other flavors that I cannot quite pick out. As expected from this ""6" the body is fairly light, though as it warms up it gets a bit thicker and fuller. This is good, the complexity is very nice and it keeps you interested in each sip as you try and dissect the flavor components."
"While I took my time enjoying my first St. Bernardus beer, I found it hard to not just gulp it down. I let it sit in the glass for nearly ten minutes before starting in on it and the beer kept getting better as it warmed. This brews balance and elegant taste and appearance bode well for my enjoying the rest of the set, including the Abt 12."
"A ""10"" for balance. Makes any other beer seem awkward."
"Poured a cloudy deep brown in color with a thick and creamy head that laced my Trappist glass nicely. Aromas are grainy, alcohol-soaked fruits, spices. Flavor, in my opinion falls far short of the abt 12 by these monks. Chalky, almost gritty flavor dominated the flavor profile. Zesty yeast flavors with a muted bannana-wheat taste. Finishes very dry. Mouthfeel a little thin. Rather tough to finish this one. Maybe I'm missing something with this one, but I wasn't blown away like I was with the abt 12."
"This beer poured a dark red amber color and formed a nice off white foamy head that coated the sides with lace as it subsided. A heavy amount of carbonation is present. An aroma of malt, dark fruit and spices. A flavor of malt, chocolate and spices. The finish is dry yet tangy. Not a bad beer."
"The beer as it sets in the St. Bernardus Trappist glass a very deep cherry, almost brown with the head a light tan majestic crown that is somewhat creamy in its texture and the lace a satin veil to seal of the glass. The aroma of sweet malted grains, over ripe plums, yeast, crisp and fresh with a bit of tartness, a real treasure to the senses, start is sweet malt and the top middling in its feel. Finish is humane in its acidity with the hops cordial in their spiciness, aftertaste is dry, slightly sour, a fine quaffing brew."
"Deep ruby redish brown with the predictable St. B's creamy head. Has an earthy aroma that is laced with fruit (raisins?), yeast and malt. Creamy mouthfeel with some dryness at the end. Flavor isn't as complex as the others I've had from this brewery. Fruit and malt are present yet not strong enough. Seems like a weak dubbel in my opinion."
