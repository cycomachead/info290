4.41,5.8,4,4.25,4.5,4.5,4.5,"I really enjoyed this one. A good looking dark brown ale with malty sweet aroma. Great dark fruits taste along with malts and caramel. There is a burnt essence in both the finish and aroma. There is some alcoholic quality in the taste but it is masked well by the other favors. Full bodied, creamy and quite drinkable. I will definitely get again.","Gajo74","Mar 21, 2015"

The beer is brown with a rich foamy head and some lacing going up the glass. You can smell the alcohol and caramel sweetness.This is a complex, delicious beer that is enhanced as the beer warms in the glass.It's velvety smooth.","-steve-","Mar 10, 2015"

This is the first Westmalle product I've had the opportunity to try, and I'm already pining to try more. Its spicy, complex flavours are both enticing and wholly satisfying, making this definitely one of the better dubbels that I have tried over the years. Keeping in mind that this is probably my least-favourite of the major styles of 'abbey beer', I am still convinced that this is one of the best dubbels in the world - and it would be welcome in my glass to celebrate any occasion.","thehyperduck","Mar 04, 2015"

The smell first struck me as cinnamon, perhaps raisins as well.  Taste reminds me of a Cherry Coke with a very full body, creamy and malty.  Very interesting taste for a beer.  The sweetness really lingers in the aftertaste, and it is very pleasant.   I really enjoyed this beer.","ENogueira","Aug 25, 2014"

A dry finish that leaves a lingering sweet aftertaste of toasted bready malts and fruitiness with a hint of chocolate. No taste of alcohol. Medium-full body and carbonation, creamy mouthfeel.

The aroma is very complex, brown sugar, plums, figs and raisins all come up, apple and wine smells also come through. Slightly bitter overall, the flavors is just as complex, the hops are present as you swallow, mild grapefruit zest, dark fruits and some raisin are all mixed in.

4.73,13.4,4.5,4,5,5,5,"I have been harassed for years for turning my nose to dubbels. Don't ask me why. They just didn't sit right with me. Always seemed like the shitty little brother to my lovely quads. Not the juicy quads on these foreign girls that raid my nest, but the herculian brew we all raise a glass to. Those spectacular beverages that push the double digit mark on the ABV scale. For the second time in my life, I have been proven wrong. Avoiding dubbels meant that I was avoiding Westmalle Dubbel, and this beer happens to be one of the most finely tuned brews on God's green earth. The perfect balance. Exceptional taste and mouthfeel. Reminds me of the breasts I had in my mouth this past weekend. This, in turn, reminded me of the third time in my life I had been proven wrong. Right after discovering this special beer, I was approached my a loose-lipped Dutch girl at a hostel I was spending the night in. During conversation, breast size was brought up, and my friend guessed that she was a b-cup. I laughed at the notion that she was a b, since that chest was going nowhere but inward, so leaned closer for further inspection. With the Westmalle Dubbel in one hand, I used my free mitt to size up the specimen. He was right, b-cup. I then finished my Westmalle, and convinced her to fetch more beers. I then went to sleep. She could not trick me into sleeping with her. Since that night, I have realized that when guessing bra size, the b-cup is the go-to cup size. That guess will win you more battles than you lose. There is also such a go-to when it comes to world class beers. This is Westmalle Dubbel. It may not be the people's champ, like the over-hyped c-cup, but it is always the go-to when you need something to bring home. I am now a Dubbel man, and Westmalle is my girl.","Toddzillamz","Oct 03, 2012"

Aroma is light on the nose. There is sweet/dark fruit, but also the typical crispness. It's not overwhelming, but the smell is fresh and light. Taste is similar to smell, except less sweetness, more dark fruit. IT does have a ""nectar"" flavor to it, but again overwhelming. Mouthfeel is fresh and crisp, almost like a champagne, with medium carbonation and relative smoothness.

The stewed hop/cardboard notes, on the other hand, are excessive and taint the flavour. The phenolic/alcohol hints also seem disproportionate. I'm not loving it, but I suspect it's gone stale and/or oxidised. I'll try and re-review when I get my hands on a fresher example.","jazzyjeff13","Sep 07, 2012"

It's unattractive and faint. The best you could say about it is that it's kind of light and refreshing if you're ever in the mood for something innocuous that doesn't really get you involved or bogged down, like if you're meeting someone for a drink but don't really want to and just want to drink up and get out. But you're left wanting after each sip, wanting flavor and richness and body. It's hard to believe it's 7%. I'd have guessed 3.5%. If I'd never heard of this beer, I'd rate it average. I thought I had heard it was really good so it's extra disappointing. That's not extra points off, just context. It's not offensive, just weak. I feel kind of robbed, given what it could have been.

Sweet caramel malt with some darker roasts and a fruity ester. Taste is the highlight here, orgy comes to mind. Rich caramel and darker malt, chocolate and nutty. Fruity esters also play a big role, date and raisin, entertaining to the last drop. Mouthfeel is very smooth, hint of alcohol. Overall a fantastic beer.

Im going to rate this well regardless of its sourness because it was in fact still good. Not great, not perfect, not up to par with its older brother westmalle triple. This beer's age and improper storage may have led to the bottle's accelerating decline. These usually have a great cellaring history.

4.42,6,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"11.2 ounce bottle into chalice, bottled 1/09/2011. Pours hazy and cloudy dark reddish brown color with a nice 2 finger fairly dense khaki head with fantastic retention that reduces to a thick cap that lasts. Some spotty lacing clings to the glass as well; with plenty of carbonation streaming up from the bottom creating a creamier head than on the pour. Aromas of huge raisin, caramel, molasses, prunes, biscuit, roasted nuts, light chocolate, and yeast spices. Big malty aromas here with good strength and balance. Taste of big caramel, molasses, pepper, chocolate, roasted nut, biscuit, dark fruit, and spicy yeast. Lingering notes of biscuit, caramel, chocolate, pepper, and yeast spices on the finish for a bit. Nice malty flavor with no cloying, and less spiciness than I was expecting from the yeast. Medium bodied with lively carbonation; with a fairly creamy and very smooth mouthfeel. Drinks incredibly easily with the high carbonation as well. Alcohol is essentially non existent with only a slight warming after the finish. Overall this is a fantastic Dubbel style as I would have expected. Great balance of flavors and dangerously drinkable.","superspak","Jan 21, 2012"

The mouthfeel of this beer is really quite nice, it's very smooth, had a creamy body to it and goes down really easy.

Outside the Rochefort brews, both this and the Chimay are 2 of the best dubbels available and are fairly easy to find in the small populated area I live in.

3.51,-15.8,4,3,3.5,4.5,3.5,"Westmalle Dubbel pours a typical dark purple/brown. Ruby red highlights shine through with some exuberance when the beer is held to light. The light tan colored foam maxes out at over four fingers in height, and shows some solid retention. Lacing isn't nearly as widespread as it should be though. The nose doesn't have quite the amount dark fruits than I'd like, and the result is an aroma that's a little too phenol heavy to really appeal to me. The flavor has a similar dark fruit deficiency, but unlike the nose it's at least replaced somewhat by a toffee note. The clove, spicy phenol notes on the back end are intense, and threaten to overwhelm the beer. The mouthfeel at least has the excellence I've come to expect from trappist beers. The body is beguilingly light for a beer with a definite sweetness in its flavor profile. At the same time the carbonation, even at the bottom of the glass, is active enough to give the beer a vibrant energy. Westmalle Dubbel is a solidly brewed beer, I'm just not a huge fan of the fruity ester vs phenols balance in this one.","axeman9182","Jul 31, 2011"
4.47,7.2,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Overall - Very smooth and easy to drink. The floral fruit flavors really add bold sweetness. Each drink is balanced, sweet with mild yeast in the background.

4.5,7.9,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5," Ultimately, this beer ends with a well balanced blend of chewy and almost leathery malts. The balance tips towards the malt/alcohol side but the hops dash around in the background giving this beer a bright spunky spark. The beer goes down smooth and beckons for another taste. This beer is wonderful in all aspects. The flavors are distinctive and each sip is a pleasure. This would pair very well with desert foods. It is a perfect evening beer.","BerkeleyBeerMan","Jul 10, 2011"

Rich notes of spice, dark fruit, plums, raisins, mostly in the front as a nice grainy and bread like aroma started to peak through as it really warmed up, along with a light hint of a spiced pear or apple. At the first sip I was in love. I am not normally a fan of the style as it is usually rather plain for me, sitting somewhere between the sessionable and the extreme, but a whole new life was brought forward for me here. Key word in this beer was smooth, it was simply breathtakingly smooth and subtle. Rich notes of raisins and plums, hints of light spice, pears, great yeast notes here. There was just such a smooth, subtle flavor here. I really am at a loss, as I rarely find a beer this drinkable. The long aftertaste was rich with a ripe fruit flavor that left an almost funky note that was only detectable after a few minutes after the sip. Just a wonderful expierence.","mikesgroove","May 21, 2011"

I love the mouthfeel and could drink this beer alone, with food, on a cold day, or in an alley and I would be happy. I feel that the carbonation combined with the subtle notes of chocolate and malt just make an explosion of flavor that surprised me the first time I drank one. I was a huge fan of the Triple and randomly tried the Dubbel and soon found a new favorite. The proper pour in the proper glass just gives me a happy feeling every time I return to it.

The yeasts really add a harshness that takes away the candied sugars, and Belgiany malts that I was looking forward to. The slighly burnt, coarse, prickly, banana and the slightly boozy pineapple flavors just don't blend all that well. The beer has a harsh cardamon spiciness that doesnt' play nice either. Where's the nice caramel malts, where's the candied sugars, where's the star anise? The beer settles in a bit as it warms and that helps.

Head eventually collapses into a solid quarter in cap with thick swaths of lacing coating the sides of the glass as the brew recedes and with each tilt of the glass. Nose is fairly subdued - malt, spice, a faint suggestion of prunes and some phenols. Taste follows nose, but extremely watered down. There's also a slightly bready quality and some herbal bitterness that lightly lingers between quaffs. I have to say that I was expecting more. Mouthfeel is medium-light, with a fairly assertive carbonation. While I really enjoyed the tripel, I have to say that the dubbel left a lot to be desired.

The taste is much truer to style, with flavors of raisins, sweet (rather than tart) cherries, and a caramel sweetness. The effervescence that seems common among Trappist beers mutes some of the flavor, but at the same time invigorates the liquid, helping it slip over the tongue with a silky drinkability.

Has a brown, gold crimson color and a head the color of ripe dates. The nose wasn't as forthright as I'd originally anticipated but was still aromatic enough offering caramel sweet malt, white raisin, cocoa shavings and jammy fruits. Yeasty notes are evident in the smell and taste categories but it is subtle and lends character. Very impressed with the taste of this beer and the quality in the craftsmanship. Lots of dried and jammy fruits like apple jelly, fig newton insides, semi-dried dates, a sweet raisiny backing through into the finish which offers a light cocoa shot in the finish. Flavors linger awhile, mouthfeel is dry, silky smooth and creamy. Very drinkable, even though you savor every sip and enjoy the complexities, you will raise the glass often. Very good stuff. If it wasn't so pricey I would enjoy this frequently.","natelocc787","Dec 14, 2009"

The yeast and tasted bread are there as well, but the dry fruit flavor and alcohol edge dominate. You can tell this is well crafted, and damn good thing, because it hinges upon becoming a mess.

Medium-full body with very fine carbonation. At first it's overcarbonated but with a little time it settles down. A very good dubbel.","illidurit","Mar 22, 2009"
3.68,-11.8,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"I get a lot of sweet malts backed by belgian sugars, mingling with some darker sensations, like some burnt sugar, licorice. Very yeasty, and the darker sensations give it a bit of a kick. I don't get any of the bubblegum sweetness in the background, no raspberry, none of the fruitiness I'm used to from other dubbles. Seems to be medium bodied, lighter than I would have thought, a lot less dense. Very creamy, and decently coating. I think for me though, it doesn't have that earthy fruitiness I like, the darker flavors come through too strongly. Not dark fruit, but licorice is a good way, or a burnt roastiness you might find more in a stout. Has a slight bitterness to the finish, maybe alcohol burn, maybe roastiness. Not my first trappist, and most likely not my favorite. Still good to try though.","damienblack","Mar 22, 2009"

It is a simple flavor that's pretty well bittered. It's a bit sour and a touch sweet, with notes of leather, pepper, hay, juniper and brett.

Quite a lot of carbonation, lots of small bubbles racing rapidly toward the surface. Nice malty aroma and I was eagerly anticipating a full body/heavy ale. Good initial malt flavor but the mouth feel was not at all what I'd been expecting from it's aroma. Fairly thin/light mouth feel, somewhat dry finish with a faint sweetness remaining on the center of my tongue, possibly a very faint citrus note.

The taste starts with light sweet maltiness leading into dark fruit flavors and ending with a slight alcohol presence. Nice smooth mouthfeel. Full flavor, medium body, and not too high alcohol lead to a very drinkable dubble. Overall, not bad at all. I can see why this gets such great reviews.

There was a high amount of carbonation (as there should be) and the color of this beer is something to write home about. It is hard to describe the color - sort of a reddish brown carmel malty color - very beautiful. The aromas coming off tis ale are very malty, slightly sweet, and intense. Of course you can smell the alcohol, but that's only natural for this style. As for taste, it is unquestionably great, but I can't help but compare it to Chimay Blue. The hardest thing is to call whether or not I like it better than the Chimay Blue. Chimay is a bit more intense in the flavors, but the Westmalle dubbel is more smooth.

Head is full, tan, and made up of mostly uniform bubbles. Leaves some spots of lace, but it is minimal. Smells of honey, dried fruits, apples, pears, orange zest, grape juice, a little chocolate, and some faint floral hops. Flavor starts off with a bit of yeast character and some spicy notes mixed in with orange oil and a variety of fruits very close to what I found in the aroma. I pick up some toastiness and a bit of roast malt flavor as well as a little cocoa powder. Overall this has a sweetness to it, but dries up in the finish along with the coming of floral and earthy hops and a soft bitterness that seems to come from a mix of the hops and kilned grains. Mouthfeel has solid body to it, but it is far from cumbersome. It weighs on the tongue just enough to let it know it's there. Carbonation gives the flavors some life but is not harsh or intrusive.

I would of like to see more malt notes in the aroma. Mouthfeel is a bit flat in the carbonation area. ABV is well-hidden and it goes down smooth. Has the same kind of mouthfeel a Guinness might deliver in the area of texture. Aftertaste is very bitter with strong phenols. Has a watery rolling texture that is easy on the mouth.

Nice but simpler than I would have thought. The taste is fantastic. Smooth cocoa up front, sweet and sour fruit, then a crisp aftertaste that tastes of baking spices. It reminds me of fresh baked bread. The mouthfeel is silky but surpisingly thin for its pedigree and color. Drinkability is great. The balanced flavor makes the aftertaste leave you wanting more of the original taste and vice-versa. This one doesn't stand up to the tripel but it is simple only by the standards of its off-the-charts trappist cousins. A beer not to be missed.","roblowther","Feb 15, 2007"

3.68,-11.8,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Poured this one into my Duvel tulip glass. Nice eruption of fizzy head that settles into a creamy tan 1/4"" thick layer on top of the dark brown beer. The nose is rather floral not showing much sign of sweetness, but it is still very much a complex aroma. The first taste is a quick burst of alcohol flavor and a slight bitter ending. I am drinking this at room temperature. After a few more sips it turns into a very warming beer. Not the sweet and rich flavor of several of the dubbels I've had before, but more of a subtle complexity. The mouthfeel is slightly handicapped by the alcohol taste. This is a very odd beer, very mellow yet bold. Very drinkable although it's no good on the wallet. Overall, this beer wasn't as great as I thought it would be. I will have to try a tripel of theirs, I have read that it is much more impressive.","Rudgers73","Jan 25, 2007"

Dry, but noticeable. Some light chocolate on the finish. The taste is wonderful- very dry, with a light creaminess up front, some drying bitterness in the middle and the development of fruit flavors as the taste goes on: dates, prunes, and apples. Sweet malt is also noticeable, as well as some chocolate at the end. Very little alcohol is noticeable.The mouthfeel is one of the most interesting aspects of this beer. It is extraordinarily creamy- it almost seems to float on the tongue. I'm unsure of whether I really like this or if it ends up giving the beer too light of a feel. I think ultimately it probably increases the drinkability score and decreases the mouthfeel score. This beer is a classic- very drinkable, surprisingly refreshing for a trappist ale. A real winner, and one which I hope will be brewed for many years.","Georgiabeer","Jan 23, 2007"

Pours a deep dark chestnut...if this beer was the sky, one might think a storm could be well on it's way. It has that kind of intensity. A burnt sugar head dissipates into a subtle crown not to far down the cup. Raisin, brown sugar, and subtle hints of coffee dominate the nose. The taste follows the nose beautifully, nuances of anise periodically break through. A smooth, heavy body is complimented by the slightly tart finish that lingers well.

Fresh Westmalle is now available in the USA, I had experienced way too many old bottles in the past over here; old, musty, aged, mishandled and poorly transported  this alone has the been the single reason why I never submitted a Beer Review for either the Westmalle Dubbel or Tripel since joining BA - simply because I knew how good this could be. I find Merchant Du Vin are a little pricey at times, but that said I had no problems paying a little extra for a good fresh bottle. In short, in the US, if it doesnt say MdV on the reverse label, my advice would be to put it back on the shelf, if it *does* say Imported by MdV on the reverse label  pick it up and remind yourself how good this one is.

4.4,5.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,"Cascading from its distinctively shaped Westmalle bottle, this Dubbel sits before me enticing me to learn its secrets. Hazy deep amber brown is its hue, and it is filled with free floating solid matter. Khaki colored head crops up huge and then dies down to a manangeable level. The head is composed of small and distinct tightly knit bubbles. Malty aroma hints at dark fruit and apples below the bread surface. At first, I am taken aback by the huge, crisp carbonation. Concentrating on this ethereal tasting experience, I am confronted by a metric ton of bready malt at the beginning of the taste. Going deeper, sweet toffee and caramel are revealed to me, leading into luscious ripe fruits. Some nuttiness graces my palate, all of this amid streaks of a woody smokiness. Herbal and earthy notes frolic about, setting the stage for some spicy and biting citrous hops that boldy make a stand. Finish is toasty malt mixed with very bitter lemon and orange peel hop glory. There is a pronounced acidity in the finish as well, lending a vinous quality. As stated before, the mouthfeel is very crisp, moving this taste along with brisk carbonation. Fantastically complex, this brew is meant to be sipped and analyzed, not quaffed. As I reflect upon the greatness that is Westmalle I am content with a single glass of this liquid alchemy.","BeerFink","May 22, 2005"

The taste was very balanced and complex with an initial rush of sweet malt and dark fruit flavors which quickly segued into an effervescent rush of carbonation which seeme do have a bit of hop bitterness in it as well finishing dry and clean.

3.57,-14.4,4,4.5,3,3.5,3.5,"Dark brown in hue with a tawny-ruby influence, I could see a few chunks of yeast floating in the liquid, oops! Still Id say the beer is largely clear. The head is off-white in color, almost beige, at the apex the head reached one finger in height and it quickly faded to a half finger cap, this remained for the entire consumption. Impressive. Subsequent lacing was splotchy and it clung poorly. Still this is a good-looking beer, largely because the head held like cement. The nose is very enjoyable, the potency isnt as loud as Id like but Im picky. The aromas included a fantastic malty base, rich and chocolately like a cookie. Nutty. Toffee. If this was all the bouquet offered Id be happy. But Im elated because there is a hell of a lot of fruity aromas! Including cherries, dates, raisins, grapes (yes, there is a difference between raisins and grapes), apples infused with figs, coriander and brandy. Nice! As a whole, the nose is a malty harvest! The palate doesnt live up the nose. Its not close really. The bouquet told me, big, malty backbone rich, flavorful. It was not. I found the malt to be thin and not that flavorful. Sure, it is good but not that yummy. The alcohol is a little too naked as well; this hurts the fruity qualities, which is a shame. I can find some nuttiness, bitter chocolate that is not very rich. There is some astringency that is vague and aimless, it cant find a partner to dance with. Clovey. Fruitiness is a mix of bananas with a very weak kiss of grapes and apples. On the whole the palate is good but nothing more, it lacks pizzazz for one thing but the weakness of the malt is really disappointing. For a Dubbel it is average, decent. The mouthfeel is too thin. Again more malt please. Medium-light in body with zesty carbonation, the bubbles feel small but active. This aspect of this beer is satisfactory. I dont really care for the tacky aftertaste. Sure this beer is drinkable; I found it quite pleasant and enjoyable. I have to mention a bottle in Omaha runs $5.00. With that in mind, it is not *that* drinkable! I can buy a six-pack of New Belgiums (much tastier) Dubbel for $6.50. It is a no-brainer as to what beer Id select in the future. Bottom line, it is a good beer but nothing special and nothing I think I will seek out again (unless it is much cheaper at Johns in Iowa City).","bditty187","Oct 13, 2004"

For the rest the beer ( best before 21/5/04) was still in a perfect condition. Great hoppy smell and a great taste of candice sugar fermentation, malts and hop. Altogether it came very hamonic. I realy enjoyed drinking it and I wondered how it could be that I didn't drink one earlier, cause it's just a great beer! Probably its because I love their triple so much that I forgot how good the double is.... and am sure the rest of my stock Westmalle double won't last that long.","paterlodie","Sep 21, 2004"

Slight suggestions of husk, spice and sun-dried dark fruit. Head retention is good even in the wide-lipped Westmalle chalice. Initial sip implies a slight anise and husky dark malt in flavor, finishing clean and slightly dry. Further tastes include notes of sweat, yeast, plum skins, and a metallic twang that comes from an active carbonation and coincides well with the evident huskiness. Faint woody esters come into play.

Not a ton of carbonation, so it was easy to drink. Over all, pretty damn tasty. Oh yeah, and my bottle says 7.0%abv, not 6.5%. Slight change in recipe, perhaps? New discovery made at the brewery?

Its replete with the fruits detected on the nose as well as berries and an alcohol twang. Its extremely refreshing, my only fault with the taste is that the alcohol is a little strong tasting for its low ABV. Many Belgian brews with much higher ABVs conceal them better than this.

Carbonation is sharp in the beginning then gives way to a big warming feeling at the end. So smooth and so balanced. I am guessing the alcohol notes would mellow out with a bit of aging.

The taste is also fairly malty and a little sweet, but with a slightly tart and dry finish. It doesn't hide the alcohol well, and it's only 6.5% abv.

Presentation 11.2 oz bottle. Pours a medium brown, somewhat clear, but that's because I kept the inch (that much?) of yeast sediment from pouring into the glass. Head was a surprising mix of large and small bubbles, off-white/tan, that looked more like a soda pop head than a beer head. Aroma is the best feature of this beer. Bready with a light sweetness, malty, pleasant gentle chocolate. Aroma follows through into flavor; here some pepper also comes through. However, the alcohol isn't hidden as much as I would like, thus negatively affecting the balance (in my humble opinion). Still very good and I will gladly drink more, but would like it toned down a bit. As it warmed, it seemed there was almost some smokiness coming through (I don't think this is quite right, but I can't find a better descriptor). Maybe a bit of aging helps mellow and balance it a bit.","Dukeofearl","Jul 11, 2004"

As I crack the top of the signature Westmalle bottle, a volcano erupts reaching for the heavens catching me off guard and making for a sloppy beginning to the pour. Let it be said now, that this, if any was the only flaw I could find with this beer. The final pour resulted in a deep, earthy, reddish-brown body with a lively light beige head that calms quickly, as if to show reassurance in my snifter being its final resting place. The smell dominately sweet, but beyond that nearly indescribable. Imagine smelling every fruit in existence exclusively and all together at the same time--Fruitopia of the Gods. The taste reflects the nose with a symphony of sweetness which is obviously the masterful combination of malts with the trademark belgian touch of sugar and spices. The sweetness is not out of control and there is a hint of yeast and a slight bitterness and crispness to the finish. Mouthfeel is medium in body and very smooth. As far as drinkability goes, I could drink this beer all night with or without food, in a pub or at home, and with a fox or in a box. Praise to Westmalle once again!","TripelJ","Jun 16, 2004"

Better than the Val Dieu, and better than Chimay Red or Maudite, IMO. Nice dark, fruity taste. Wonderful balance and taste.

Taste was very smooth, had a yeasty bite but was not riddled with cloves, bananas and spices. I detected a solid malt base with a yeast presence. Some slight raisiny fruitiness was good.

A nice earthy dusting of dry yeast and bread crusts settles across the top after a bit with ever so present gleams of candied sugars. Taste is plump and a bit overcarbonated which gets in the way for me with every sip, as soon as I begin to get something out of it taste wise, the carbonation wipes it away far to quickly. A bit too sharp for my tastes. Perhaps an aged bottle of a year or more would help as this was bottled 2004. What is there for tastes are some dullish fruity malts in a darker realm of plum, raisin, and dry figs, mixing a bit inbetween some pear and cherry pieces. Slight cocoa and a firm earthy yeasty dryness with just a pinch of spice and walnut skin dryness finish it out. Very nice finish. Body is full with a bit much on the carbonation scale which has a scratchy/chalky-like coat on the way down which sorta blends into the complex drying qualities in the finish after awhile, which I actually liked, so that made up for some of my dissatisfaction in the carbonation dept..

It has an aroma of fruit, malt and toffee. Medium-bodied and rather smooth with lively carbonation. The flavor consists of fruit (plum was very noticeable), malt, and nuts. The flavors did not seem to play very well together though. The finish has a nice dark fruit character to it though. This beer is decent but I have had better Dubbels.","Dogbrick","Jan 14, 2004"

A medium amount of carbonation and some sediment present. An aroma of malt and fruit with a trace of bread/yeast. A flavor of malt, and some fruit, but the presence of the alcohol overpowers it.

3.58,-14.1,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"This beer was quite dry and at first not nearly as complex as I was expecting. The color was solidly amber without much in the way of haze. As it warmed up a bit it began to open up and show what it had to offer. It picked up a hint of sweetness which helped to boost the malt perception. There was a bit of raisin the mouth as well as a finish that was sweet from the alcohol. The aroma too had an alcohol component to it as well as a bit of woodiness. Quite estery tasting without being particularly fruity tasting. There seemed to be some higher alcohols in here as well.","Gueuzedude","Sep 23, 2003"

The one thing that struck me about the taste of this beer is that it's extremely comforting for some reason. Figgy, fruity taste with understated chocolate tones. The mouthfeel is out of this world. It's just so smooth. While this isn't one to pound down night after night, this beer is just so drinkable. I'm seriously in Heaven drinking this beer. Spectacular.","Admiraldinty","Aug 19, 2003"
4.73,13.4,4.5,4,5,5,5,"I managed to resist temptation somewhat successfully and age this bottle for about one year before succumbing. Right from the crack of the cap, the beer gives off a pleasant sweet prune-like aroma, undergirded by a distinctively Belgian yeasty maltiness. This dubbel is quite an attractive beer -- deep mahogany in color with a thin, light tan head. The flavor starts off quite sweet, characterized largely by a deep, figgy fruitiness. Combined with the bready body, this gives me the (not unpleasant) impression of Fig Newtons. Toward the end, light chocolatey and toasty notes are noticeable in the background, and the beer finishes with a mild alcohol spiciness. Quite full and body, and luxuriously creamy in mouthfeel. Very, very yummy.","mzwolinski","Aug 14, 2003"

Lots of candied fruits on the smell, carmelized like the bottom of bananas foster. Super smooth taste, more candied fruit, carmel and bananas. Rum soaked cherries. Little hints of spices, cinammon, etc. Very good, flavor soaked yeasty belgian goodness. Hints of bitterness on the finish, just ever so dry. Very smooth and drinkable. A real treat.

Notes of the sweet malt, very subdued hops, yeast and raisins introduce themselves to the palate. This is a very well balanced dubbel, perhaps the best I've tried so far. The alcohol is definitely there, but hard to pinpoint. Definitely worth seeking out.","Jon","Jun 14, 2003"

It is perfectly balanced, with subtle fruit tones in the bouquet. Unlike Corsendonk's wine-like aftertaste, the Westmalle leaves you savoring its complexity and wanting more. Be sure to air it out, as it gains more character just below cellar temp. Also, be sure to serve it in the proper glassware... presentation and aroma are everything with a beer this good. Definately a cost-wise alternative to Abbaye des Rocs' offerings.","ChrisBowers","Apr 11, 2003"

Light-to-medium body; active carbonation. Taste is nowhere near as syrupy and cloyingly sweet as the smell leads you to expect; I find this to be a positive thing.

3.53,-15.3,4,3.5,3,3.5,4.5,"Persistent beige head sits atop a ruddy, lightly hazy brown brew.  Loose lace is left.  The aroma is dominated by milk chocolate and dark caramel sweetness complemented by surprisingly light banana fruity esters. Slight sour apple tartness eeks into the end of the aroma.  Flavorwise, nutty malt and prune like fruitiness quickly yield to dark, raisiny Special B and mellow chocolate malt.  Sweetness is akin to diluted molasses and is well controlled, not overbearing, but is somewhat one dimensional. Light on the palate all around, smooth in mouthfeel and highly drinkable.  Mild banana ester reemerge in the otherwise neutral and slightly watery finish.  Westmalle's Double is surprisingly understated and shy in malt and yeast character, but is nonethless very well balanced and highly drinkable.","marc77","Oct 13, 2002"

What a gorgeous brew in the appropriate stemmed glassware. Monster, lumpy ass, misshapen head that did not quit. Quite a rich flavored brew that's deep ruby colored with nutty notes.
