"Best blue moon beer. When I see it I buy it"
""
"The best BM offering by far."
""
"This is a ghastly beer."
""
""
"Very Good But not favorite of all time"
"Personally don't understand the bad reviews. Yes, it's produced by Coors, but I don't hold that against it. Nice smell, nice colour, great taste, my favourite production from the Blue Moon family."
"Overall: Hard not to compare this to the standard Blue Moon Belgian White. It is similar, but more spice and less citrus, a little more roast. Something is missing from the flavor; not sure what. Overall, it is not offensive, but it is hard to get excited about."
""
""
"Fairly light bodied...or at least in the feel. Not a good representation of the style"
""
""
"Not what I expected from Blue Moon.  I'l stick with the regular Blue Moon"
"Better than expected - but did not expect much.  Nice brown type ale, not too spiced.  Smooth, nice mellow beer that will not seek out, but would accept if offered."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this beer is a pass, too sweet for my palate and it lacks spice and depth of flavor."
""
""
"This poured a nice coppery orange.  The nose was malty along with a brown sugar syrupy smell.  No hops to be found.  The taste however was very thin.  I was expecting some of that malty sweetness to come through but it ended very quickly.  I thought the mouth feel was a bit too bubbly, almost soft drink fizz.  It wasn't a bad beer, it was however average."
""
""
"Beer is an average season beer not my favorite"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"For a double, it's pretty thin tasting. Acidic alcohol finish, no real Carmel or accompanying notes. Kind of disappointed really. I was hoping for more Spice and flavor."
""
""
"Solid beer."

"my go to winter beer besides shiner cheer. love the sugary taste. it's simple, but i enjoy it."
""
""
""
""
""
"No real complaints.  It's winter warmth and very drinkable.  I am just struggling to taste much in this brew.  That said, loved the pumpkin a couple months ago."
""
"Has a bit of the taste of the pumpkin! A decent beer"

"O: While I definitely would not call this a winter abbey ale, I would call this a winter ale. It has the characteristic spiciness of the american style winter ale. It's nice and spicy, with a decent malt backbone. Typically, I find orange in the mix in Belgian christmas ales. Recommended, worth a try, and definitely underrated."

"Average in the glass, it is a clearish dark brown with a thin off white head that settles quickly and laces a bit. There is quite a bit of caramel and a bit of toasted malt in the smell, the background may also hold some belgian yeast character as well but if anything it is weak. The taste is dominated by the caramel as well, it's a bit slick with maybe a touch of metallic twang in there as well. Really no bitterness to speak of as this beer is sweet all the way through with a slightly sticky finish that really doesn't do much to invite the next sip. The body is heavier than I would have expected but the weird flavor combinations and finish prevent a higher score in this category. Overall this isn't very good I see how this may appeal to hardcore Blue Moon fans but I'll leave it for them."

"D - A so so at best beer... The appearance and aroma led me to think this one may have a chance of surprising, but the flavor profile turns a bit messy... A few minor tweaks could go a long way... Not terrible, but in its current form it is not anything I would recommend nor revisit..."

"Damn marketing people. I have to confess that the label sold me. It was the cozy, snowy winter cabin. But, it's basically a coors banquet beer with some specialty malts added. Ok, that might be harsh, but I definitely taste the 'coors' in it. One of those beers that you buy on a impulse just to try it, (cause it is on sale, even though you know it's not really craft beer) drink the 6 pack, say ""that was decent", and then never buy it again."

"Nice looking brew with a nice lacing effect. VERY nice smell....kinda had a holiday feeling just upon smelling this stuff. Tasting it was very pleasant at first, but the spicy effects were a little overwhelming as I got closer to the end of the bottle. Some may like this, but a little went a long way with me. Worth a try if you like unique spicy brews. Left a pleasant spicy taste in mouth."
"Fairly ordinary although not bad, however it was a little too sweet and started to become slightly sickening nearer the end. I'd stick to the original if I was you but it wasn't enough to put me off seeking out other Blue Moon varieties in future."

"Pours a clear brown, with an almost non-existent head. aromas of lightly roasted grain. Taste begins with some brown sugar, then some licorice, then an astringent grain finish. Light mouthfeel. Overall this is just not that good of a beer. It doesnt taste that much like a Dubbel, but even for a quasi brown ale its pretty watery."
"Overall, this was a reasonably crisp, refreshing quaff with enough character to distinguish it from typical BMC offerings. It was malty with enough bite to keep it from being overly sweet (and this coming from a serious hophead). You could do worse."
""
""
""
""
""
"Points off, though, for being a really disappointing example of the style."
""
""
""
"Pours a clear copper with a foamy khaki head that settles to an oily film on top of the beer. Foamy streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of toasted malt and caramel aromas. Taste is much the same with a malty flavor on the finish. There is a mild amount of roasty bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is an average beer that is drinkable but pretty one dimensional with emphasis on malty aromas and flavors."

""
""

"Overall a decent, very drinkable beer, great for those who don't like their beer to taste bitter, sharp or skunky."

"I would avoid this, whatever it is. I don't remember it being so unpleasant when I bought a six a few years ago, but then I never bought another one. From the 12 oz bottle, a single I picked up."

"O- Coors is a weak brewery when it comes to micros and this brew just reaffirms that for me."

""

""

""
"This is a great winter beer, perfect for sitting around a fireplace and enjoying great conversation, the beer equivalent of Sherry or Port. Food recommendations include heavy stews and chocolate based desserts, but I suggest just savorying it on it's own. Cheers!"

"This is like a store-bought Christmas gingerbread cookie. You can't honestly say that it doesn't taste good, but it sure ain't the same as Grandma's fresh from the oven recipe."
"This isn't a horrible drink, it's just not a dubbel. But it also isn't that great either."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Not bad. The taste lacks somewhat in complexity."
""
""
""
""
"O - Hmm...BMC product. Not supposed to like this, right? Then how come I found this to be pretty decent? Man, if it wasnt for a few minor flaws, this would be really good. As is, it's definitely drinkable, and better than it's competition. (SA Winter Lager) Would gladly drink again if someone handed me one."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Dark mahogany, transparent brew with weak head. Aroma of cinnamon, nutmeg and caramel without any yeast character. Weak flavor of lightly toasted wheat bread and brown rice. Overwhelming cinnamon and nutmeg. Light body and over-carbonated. I don't understand where they get the idea to call this an Abbey ale. Has none of the subtle complexities of a well crafted Belgian beer. Weak malt character and too many spices. Avoid."
""
"Easy, enjoyable drinking winter beer! Love the lack of holiday spices and high ABV. Pretty surprised by how good this is."
"Thanks for the freebie Nick!"
"Overall, a flawed beer that isn't that bad, but it's certainly not anything I want to purchase. Ok if left in your fridge after a party though."
""
"Would I buy this beer again? Probably not."

"This gives dubbels (it's so not a real dubbel) and abbey ales a bad name. Overall, it's not really sure what kind of beer it wants to be."
""
""
""
"Overall - As a beer in and of itself, it's decent. As a belgian, it's a total failure. Weak, underdeveloped flavors. A body that's not right for the style. No effort in making a true Belgian with this one, only a beer that will appeal to the masses, and you do that by minimizing flavor while cutting down on the body."
""
""
""

"O: this was an average beer, not bad not good i would drink it again if it was offered but i would not seek it out"
""
"Overall: There are way better dubbels out there no doubt. That said, this is not a bad beer and would make an excellent introduction to craft beer..It may be the best of the seasonal moon beers I have had. If I was looking for a cheap dubbel that I could have several of during a game, I would pick this up."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- Not very good. I am glad I only purchased this as part of a pick-six pack instead of a whole six pack. It had a good aroma but was a total disappointment after that."
""
""
""
"Overall: I won't buy it ever again. I think I had it last winter, and had forgotten how it was. For a seasonal offering, I was expecting something at least halfway special. I know this is a macro-owned brew, but even those can hit occasionally. This one missed. Pass on it unless its free."
"Disappointing for a Winter Ale; not as much flavor and body as I would want. A little bitter on the finish. The taste is good, but it disappears too quickly. Tastes very much like a typical lager, eg. Yuengling. I would like it to be heavier and more flavorful."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, the aroma profile is appealing, but the balance doesn't finish the job."

"The actual taste of the beer is wonderful, however it is fleeting at best. Lacking substance. If the whole flavor of the beer was intensified, even just slightly, it would rate much better. Quite easy to drink, but not quite as much joy in drinking it as there should be."

""
"This one is bit underrated to me. Granted, it doesn't smell or taste like a true abbey ale, but for me this is actually preferrable. It's a really smooth drinker with a touch of cinnamon sugar & nutmeg spice. Perfect for the cold weather and a surprisingly decent offshoot of the Blue Moon label."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - This isn't as bad as some of the reviews make it out to be. It's in no way a world class dubbel, but it's not undrinkable. Not something I'd buy again, but I finished my glass."
""
""
""
""
""

"clear deep brown in color with a 2 finger head and good drooping lacing but thats it. Blue moon dropped the ball here. taste is to bitter. mouth feel is tart and lasting. dont want this travesty of a beer again. still heavy like all the blue moon lines of beers but this beer missed the bus . wont have this one again"

"Overall worth the dollar I paid not worth a repeat purchase and does not restore my faith that this brewery can produce anything palatable."
""
""
"Pours out an amber hue with some lacing and no retention. The aroma is of caramel, sweet malts and some dark fruits. The taste consists of caramel, sweet sugars and some dark fruit that leaves the mouth with a chalky dry feel from a watery beer. I admit that I am not an expert on Dubbels, but this seems to be decent for a blue moon beer. I might drink this again, but before I do i will want to try other dubbels to see how much better or worse other similar beers are."
"Not a bad beer. The smell is a bit strong. Smells like a harder Bud Light. The taste is actually not too bad. Has a nice sugar taste to it. Kinda sweet with a bite to it. I usually buy this once during the winter and that's about it. Solid beer and worth trying in my opinion."
""
""
""
""
""
"As an abbey ale imitator, this is not close to the mark. It works better as an ""Irish"" red ale; as a representative of that style, I'd prefer it to Coors' Killian product and most other beers that are marketed as an ""Irish"" red."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Lacks the depth of an authentic Belgian (who woulda thought?) but not bad. Might work as a first step for getting into Belgian style beers."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Ale pours a dark brown with a half finger head. Malty aroma, non descript malty taste with a brief finish. Medium bodied. This was non-offensive straight forward malty ale. It reminded of a flavored coke drink. I am unfamiliar with the dubbel style but this no very satisfying. I guess Blue Moon at best is a transitional brand that could introduce drinkers from a pure light lager style to one with more flavor. Hopefully this will be a brief transition."

"O - this is my 2nd time having this beer, only because I got it in a mystery pack from Bevmo. Its not a bad beer...it is not good either with an off taste and way too sweet. I would not buy this again. There are much better winter beers out there and this may be one of the worst ones I have had...the thing about this one is that its not too heavy, the alcohol content is that not high compared some other winter beers."
""
""
"The beer pours a dark brown color with an off-white head. The aroma is full of a lot of cocoa and toffee notes and actually smells a lot better than I expected it to. The flavor is similar to the aroma. I get a lot of lightly roasted malts, as well as some toffee, caramel, cream and grass notes. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This was a pretty good brew! Quite malty with almost no hops to balance the sweetness - a decent attempt at a Northern European winter ale. Pleasant, easy to drink, and the collection of spices are interesting enough to offset the beer's otherwise bland profile. Decent head on the pour, didn't linger too long. All in all, more than I expected from Blue Moon but not phenomenal."

"There is a lot of malt in the aroma and taste and some subtle spices as well. Oddly, it seems to have less flavor than regular Blue Moon, but I can't figure out why. It was worth a try, but I don't think I would buy it again."
"O- Meh."
"O- Amazing for it's cost, but not the best of it's style. That said, pretty impressive beer. I might still be more inclined to get a more expensive beer of this style, though."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: It's okay. I don't really like wheat based beers, so I'm a little biased. But for what it is, it's good."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- I like this beer. The problem is that when you compare it to so many other Dubbel's out there, it just can't match up. It seems to lack the dark fruit taste that most offer. Still, I wouldn't pass it up if offered again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall I like this brew, and as long as the price is fair, I'll get it again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The style is being listed here as dubbel. Not sure why. The label says it is a ""single-style abbey ale."" That makes no sense, of course, since that's not what anybody calls anything really. One might assume they are referring to patersbier or any low-alcohol beer made by monks, but the alcohol content isn't particularly low. So, I don't know what they wanted this to be. So, that makes it hard to know what to rate it against. All I know is that it's some sort of dark semi-wheat ale monstrosity and a bad idea. Is bad idea ale a category?"
""
""
"O - This beer is a sweet malty ale. I certainly wouldn't classify it as a dubbel, but it does the job as far as all malt beers go."
""
""
""
""
"Certainly better that Blue Moon's godawful wheat beer but not very good."
""
""
"I gotta say, for a dubbel this is nothing outstanding. Simple, watered down version of the real thing. Lacking complexities big time."
""
"O - heavier than standard blue moon, but not close to a porter taste or feel. Nice beer, not outstanding"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Its a good transition beer from cheap bud light type beer towards a craft beer. Has a spicey flavor, but has no after taste which is something i liked about it cause no other beers ive tried have done that. Also if you arnt a fan of christmas ales dont try this one."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this is a very average beer from a very avg brewery its excattly what you might excpet"
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a good beer that doesn't reflect Blue Moons best work but at least for me did not retract from their reputation."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - I'm actually pretty impressed with the flavors here. This really is well balanced, and even has some cpomplexity. A pretty impressive macro brewed beer, and one that I would not turn down if offered."
""
""
"Single finger head on a hazy deep amber and red body, nice lacing. Aroma is almost all caramel malt with a slight earthy note. Flavor again is like a red with sweet Carmel malt dominating and some brown sugar notes. Medium body and moderate to high carbonation. Very drinkable and refreshing. Not a bad offering from a macro brew."
"Overall - Not too bad but I wouldn't wanna drink a lot of this.."
""
""
"O - I like the beer and I would drink another. The problem is I'm not getting any phenolic flavors. No dark fruit. Nothing belgian. It is a safe interpretation and it is good but not a good representative of an abbey style."
""
""
""
"O: Not bad for a Coors stab at a Belgian style, but nothing special."
""
"O: Actually better than I imagined. I think it's awesome Blue Moon (IE Coors) attempted a dubbel. They have just a few off-putting flavors and aromas that drag this beer down. I'm sure with a little tweaking this could be a solid offering."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Bright, clear crimson with a tall, but fizzy head that quickly dissolves to nearly nothing. Light aroma of toffee, nuts, and a whiff of dark fruit...cheap smelling overall though. Malty sweet flavor upfront, grain, bread, fruit, and a bunch of candi sugar. Increased plum and raisin as it warms. Medium-thin-ish and a bit dry in the finish. Not horrible as a beverage, but it fails at resembling any sort of Belgian ale. Needless to say, it can't hang with the real deal..."
""
"Overall - The score says it all: average. I did like the appearance of the beer, but everything else about it was kind of ho-hum. It's not bad, by any stretch, but I certainly wouldn't put it on a ""wants"" list or anything. Just average."
""
"O: Whatever this ale was intended to be, I think it is safe to say that it misses the mark. This is really subpar stuff."
""
""
""
"Overall Drinkability - Finding this out was supposed to be a dubbel ruined the beer for me. For the style, it's pretty bad. But if you think of it as a winter warmer, which was my initial impression, it's decent."
""
""
"Pours medium brown color with an average head. The scent is mostly of malts. A pretty heavy beer for Blue Moon. A nice blend of malts and grains especially the caramel and spice flavors. Perfect for a cold winter day. Perhaps this is not the best example of a Dubbel, but it is rather tasty for a Macro-brew."
"Overall, a pleasant if boring spiced winter ale. An Abbey-style ale it is not, nor should it pretend to be. But for a mass-produced beer that I can find in any grocery store in town, it's pleasantly quaffable."
"D: Pretty low points overall here. Wouldn't seek out."
""
""
"Dark amber in appearance, nice an clear. Smell, has a light toated malt aroma. Mouthfeel is fullbody with a crisp feel to the mouth. Taste is very surprising, nice blend of flavors with the right amount of sweetness. Overall, this beer is good malty brew and one that will go well with some good old roast beef."
""
""
""
""
"I'm too used to getting growler fills of ommegang from the tap to drink this beer. It was free, and also about the best I can expect from a man who drinks busch like he's already on fixed income, so I'm not complaining. However, I can't recommend this beer to others, not even for the price and convenience that it offers."
""
""
""
"Pours copper colored body with beige head. Head lasted about thirty seconds and completely dissapears. No lacing whatsover. Aroma is slightly grainy. Flavour is sweet. Poorly carbonated and leaves an odd sweet aftertaste."
""
"Overall: I like it but not the beer you will love. Yes it's real easy to drink but not full of the flavor you would truly want out of a winter beer. Try it be the judge, happy new years and cheers!"
""
""
""
"D: An OK beer, but nothing I'll come back to."
"Taste is nice with a clean sweet malt front and a good mix of Belgian notes in the yeast and finish. Some nuttiness and darker roasted flavors. Finish is crisp with a clean bitterness and a mild lactic sourness. Feel is just a touch light even considering the ""Single"" target. Certainly not thin but I want a hair more chew. Mild tingly carbonation. Not a bad beer at all in general and while not something would seek out I would not hesitate to drink now and again. Certainly an easy drinker and it has some potential as a gateway beer."
""
"O- This beer was too sweet and watery for me to recommend this beer, but not a bad Macro option if there is not much available where you are."
""
""
"D - In terms of macros, this isn't an entirely bad choice, but I'd never drink it again. It definitely loses points though for being a terrible representation of the style."
""
"O - Am okay seasonal. Decent enough to have, but you won't be too excited."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A mediocre at best dubbel. I give Blue moon props for making a seasonal beer, but its just nothing spectacular. shelf space taker"
""
"O- It is a beer that does not excite me. It is drinkable but to me that is all it will be. A good cheap buy and that is all. I got it in the Blue Moon winter pack, and it isnt going to make the top of that list either."
""
""
"Color was a very deep reddish-brown, only a faint glow of light shining through. A good finger of head with persistant lacing as I drained my mug. The smell was the most disappointing thing since I could detect almost nothing. This may be due to being overly chilled. The main event, when I poured some down my gullet, was in no way disappointing. Everything seemed to be in balance, not to sweet or bitter with a clean finish. Could taste the spices, but nothing stuck out, maybe cinnimon and corriander? In any case, the bottom line is it tasted good and I'll buy it again."

"Pours a dark amber with a soft, creamy quarter inch of white head. The nose is grainy, metallic, and a little sweet; there are notes of caramel and apples, but they're faint. The flavor is apple-like sweetness with notes of caramel and a hint of spices. The mouthfeel is medium bodied but close to full. The carbonation is just right."

"Overall I feel this is a fine beer. It is certainly not a top notch dubbel but a great beer for a macro brewery. I even think that the dubbel label is earned."
""
"It's off-style, unremarkable, and thin; but, all in all, it's not bad as a whole."
""
"Overall, this beer is easy to drink, and isn't as bad as I expected. But ... it just feels like a Coors product, and that weighs it down. It's just got some weird non-craft thing about it ... but regardless, I don't regret buying the sixer."

"This beer is ok but there are alot better options out there....I will drink the rest I have in the sampler and NOT repeat buy."

"O. this beer didn't impress me at all. for this to be called a double is very dissapointing. I am glad I only bought one."

"Just so so. Not that it was bad, but certainly not worth buying - a Sam Winter or Winter Hook, are just as available and substantially better."

"Lighter medium body, higher carbonation, watery and prickly on the tongue. I usually try to avoid anything associated with Blue Moon and this is a premium example why."
""

"O - I'd never drink this again, you're basically paying $9 for a six pack of burnt Coors light, nothing good about this beer at all, unless you want to feel cool drinking a fancy twist off beer by all means gag on this..."

"This is an interesting brew. It pours a nice lighter color that expected. Little head. The taste is crisp with some light vanilla notes. It finishes dry and without much of an after taste at all. It lacks some character that i look for in this style. Over all its not awful but not one that i would buy again."
"Poured this Belgian Dubbel from a bottle into a pint glass. Poured a deep golden clear color. Decent head, retention and nice amount of lacing left behind. The aroma is comprised of toasted malt and hints of vanilla. Light in body, malt backbone with some vanilla mixed in....I usually like vanilla beers but something is off with this one...im sure they dont use real vanilla probably some artificial extract. Semi dry finish....Overall not a very good beer."
""
"I am a huge Blue Moon fan, and honestly this beer doesn't disappoint me one bit. I read the other reviews and felt I may not like it, but I was actually really impressed. I love the complexities of the beer, and think it's full of flavor. Thanks for another great offering Blue Moon!"
""
""
"O: definitely a beer to have with dessert or for dessert, good for a malt drinker who wants a beer, I probably won't come back to this"
"Drinkability/overall- this beer was certainly easy to drink though not overall complex, goes down smooth and easy, would make a decent sessioning option in the winter time, not complex and not what you should look for if looking for real complex dubbel, but for looking at malty brown ale i didnt mind it at all and is the only blue moon i would ever see my self consuming"
"O: Meh, last one I will have."
""
"Given to me at a dinner, probably won't try again."

"So so. Moderate. Mediocre. Forgettable. For Coors, this is a shining triumph, for any half serious brewer, it is back to the drawing board."

"Caramel in color with a nice head! It has a small spice smell with a bit of sweet malts in there not impressed with smell, other than that the Taste is quite refreshing the mouthfeel was a little lighter that I had hoped but overall a good Winter Ale."
""
"Comes out of the tap an opaque chocolaty brown with a nice light tan head. Aroma is weak but appealing, with malty, chocolaty and subtle spicy tones. Rich flavor has fruity and malty tones with just a hint of caramel. Average body has some decent fizz that doesnâ€™t stick around too long. Overall, not great, but worth a try."

"Dr: Pretty drinkable for the flavour. The candied sugar is nice but a bit overdone. I'd try in on draught in the name of beerdom but I wouldn't bother getting it again."

"Actually, the smell had some nice spice to it during the last gulp. Raising smell by .5."
""
"O: Not such a bad beer, a little sweet for my taste. I would have to say this beer, like most others from blue moon, really try to appeal to the mass beer audience and neglect the true form or style."
""
"Appearance is dark amber in color with a fair head that dissipates leaving scrap lace. Smell of roasted malt, adjuncts present having a very slight abbey note, but nothing complex. Taste holds to the aroma with not alot of Belgian going on, the adjuncts stand out with the roasted malt having a roasted bitter aftertaste. Mouthfeel is light with good carbonation. A poor attempt at the style, the Abbey should be removed leaving Blue Moon Winter Ale."

"Very drinkable, but quite unfocused. I'd rate this lower if I really thought they were trying to brew a ""Dubbel," but as a generic misguided ""abbey ale"" this is more flavorful than much of New Belgium's regular offerings for example..."
"O - Could be an excellent beer, but something is missing. Excellent ingredients, but not a perfect balanced beer."
"If I'm generous this is medium-bodied. Effervescence is light. This drinks much more light a dark lager than anything else. Its not an offensive beer to drink, but not one I would ever seek out again."
"Overall- I think just gets a bad rep cause Coors is so heavily associated with Blue Moon and we all know they can't make beer for the life of them, but Blue Moon has really surprised me with this beer and their pumpkin seasonal. Didn't like Pale Moon, but if you're looking for a good seasonal beer to bring to a party or sit at home and have a few, this is worth trying. It's just as good, if not better than some of the micro-brewed winter seasonals I've had so far (and I work at a liquor store, so I've tried all the ones we got in so far) Will buy again for the right occasion."
"This beer poured out with a reddish brown color. The head was white and faded quickly. The smell of the beer had some very light Belgian aromas but nothing too true to the real Belgian Dubbels. The taste is very weak compared to most real Dubbels. The beer has some sweet flavors with some earthy notes. The mouthfeel was too light for a winter brew. Overall not too much to really say, I wasn't really impressed on this brew."
"A dryish aftertaste on this medium bodied beer seems to be the highlight of this beer, although this Winter Abbey has some spices, malt, and fruits coming through in the taste they seem to miss the point or not fulfill its potential."
"O: In all fairness to the beer, it isn't terrible. It is, however, distinctly NOT a dubbel, reminiscent of a dubbel, related to a dubbel nor does it have any other connection to a dubbel. So, as a dubbel it fails miserably in all categories except smell. As a beer, however, it's drinkable, but still not very good."
"Overall, way better than macros, but not really good. I won't seek this out again soon. Apparently the label claims it has a toffee finish. Well, that didn't happen."
"amber hue into my chalice. Minimal head, little retention. Scent is clean up front if not outright dull. Taste is a blast of sweetness with dark fruit on the edges. A bit watery but sits heavy in my stomach. Alchohol is rough around the edges. Even with the lower ABV, this is by no means a more seesion able ""belgian"" style. Blah."
"Smells mainly of malty toasted grains, with just a hint of spice and fruit at the edges. Fruity malts are the first flavors to come across on the tongue, blossoming in fruit esters such as orange and apricot. These esters are followed almost immediately by the tang of the ""Dark Belgian sugar"" mentioned on the label, which adds a nice caramel layer to the fruit. Light vanillas and toffees may also be found here. The hops don't seem to really kick in for me, which is surprising since the original label description said that there were ""multiple hops"" present. Either the recipe has changed, or the hops are simply too weak to be immediately noticeable, and instead constitute a slight background fuzz. For me, the ale's weakest point comes near the end: all of the fruity, caramel flavors fade away, leaving only a stale beer taste on the back of my throat. If I had to rate only the first half of the mouthful, I would have given it at least a four--but the aftertaste is only a one."
"Pours a clear brown with a shade of red. Smells of malt, caramel, and brown sugar. The taste is pretty good with some nice malt flavor and a little bit of sweet brown sugar, the ending is very slightly bitter. The mouthfeel is light to medium body with medium carbonation. It is a decent beer that is quite enjoyable on a cold night."
"Overall: I'll admit, I didn't think I would like this one and was secretely hoping I wouldn't, but this is a really nice beer. The only thing I would like to see is more body and perhaps a bigger overall beer. I would drink this anytime it was handed to me."
"Still prefer the traditional Blue Moon Belgian White to any of their seasonal beers I have tried thus far."
"For being a Coors brew, this beer has an impressive level of flavor. Although caramel and malt dominate most of the taste, its still more flavor than what you normally find from similar breweries. Overall I was happy that I tried it, but will not be counting the days until next winter to try it again."
"D - This not a bad beer, but it's not great either. I would pick it up before a domestic lager any day. I would say it's a hair better than regular Blue Moon, but that's not really a compliment."
"Some resemblance to a Killian's Irish Red, which stuck me as odd for a moment before I realized they are made by the same parent company. In any case, this is NOT a dubbel (as currently classified on BA); it's more of a red ale mixed with a light witbier."
"Summary: This is a below average beer. I gave it 6.8/10, or D+. This beer is strange to me. It looks very nice, smells nice, but tastes like something I'm not familiar with. Maybe like a light ale? This is the first Dubbel I've drank, so I don't have anything to compare it to. The taste is really quite bland, nothing stands out here. That could be how it's supposed to taste though, I'm not sure. I'm really impressed with the head and retention, but not much else. Overall not a bad beer, but not one I'd drink often."
"Drinkability: I would definitely buy it again. Went well with some Costa Rican food, especially a rice and beans dish."
"It pours a dark red/brown color. When held up to light it is transparent. Head quickly recedes to a ring around the glass with a slight film on top of the beer. Smell isn't really there, but what I can faintly smell is alcohol and maple syrup. So far, unimpressive. Taste no longer is repulsive to me, but it doesn't really do much for me. It tastes watery... There is a slight malty sweetness and a lot of alcohol taste. Gross. Mouthfeel is thinner than I expected for a winter beer. Overall, this really isn't an improvement from the first time I tried it."
"Overall an okay beer. A poor man's version of a dubbel. It's as though it was watered down at bottling. Still, one of the better offerings I've had from a BMC company."
"I thought the brew wasn't bad with the first pint but the taste really got annoying on the second pint. I noticed the weak flavors, it seemed like it just wasn't mixing well. I think if the flavors were a little more in your face, this would be a great beer."
"Overall-lacks the overall aroma, taste, and mouthfeel of a good ""dubbel"" abbey ale. Probably the worst ""abbey ale"" that I've had. Ok overall given the price."
"This beer could be improved."
"This is a fair beer. The lack of flavor is the downside to what could be good."
"From winter brew tasting notes (2010): Pours a mostly clear, deeper amber-ruby colored body with a finger-width, frothy, light tan head that dissipates slowly and leaves a nice lacing throughout. Aroma is sweeter caramel and dark fruit with some toffee, toasty bread, and a few spicy nuts. Much better than I anticipated this being. Flavor is alright. Some thinner, sweeter caramels with a few toffees and toasted bread malts. A bit nutty, a few spices, and some dark fruits with a light straw bitterness as this finishes mostly dry before leaving a medium length aftertaste. Light-medium body and medium-high carbonation."
"Pours a pretty copper color with a thick yellowish white head and a ton of lacing. Smells of hops and wheat and a little vanilla. Tastes of wheat and a little vanilla. Odd for the style maybe some raisin. Mouthfeel is normal and not really that different from the Blue Moon normal beer. Drinkability is really just okay."
"Poured with very nice clear coppery hue, decent off-white head, some lacing. Clean crisp aroma with hints of vanilla. Smooth flavor, slighty sweet, some malts present and just a hint of bitterness. A little thin but a well balanced and very drinkable ale."
"D - Really nice easy drinking beer. I wouldn't mind a few more of these. Great winter ale."
"overall: overall pretty good. tried it for the first the last week during the packers game, didnt like it at first but i kinda grew on me."
"D: Easy to drink, pretty good, not amazing."
"The mouthfeel is probably a little too full-bodied for what you get here, it coats the whole mouth and throat on the way down, which is not really what a simple brew like this should do. It's fairly drinkable though, probably due to the fairly low ABV. The sweetness can be grating though. This winter seasonal is completely average. Nothing to really make it stand out (besides the extremely inviting appearance), nothing to love here."
"D: Smooth, goes down nicely, nothing over powering or overly impressive, just easy to drink. I definately could have a few of these!"
"overall nah, i will pass on this one,. they need to go back to the drawing board here."
"tastes more like a standard winter ale. as expected, this poser Coors beer does not live up to the ""Abbey Dubbel"" style indicated on the label"
"Drinkability: a middle-of-the-road beer, quality-wise. I wouldn't make this a common addition to my beer calendar, but one once in awhile ain't bad."
"Overall, a rather bland dubbel, but might serve as a very basic intro to Belgian brews. Spiced and toffee, not a bad combination for playin' dominos in the winter."
"Drinkability: Easily accessible, but also somewhat restrained. It lacks a bit of complexity but there are Abbey style ales from Belgium that taste exactly like this (and there are some that are even lighter) so it's actually hard to fault. It's a really nice, easy drinking beer. It's tasty and charming. One note - allow it to warm a bit to display its full range of flavor."
"D: As for the drinkability of this one, there is no harsh characteristics that tend to be undrinkable. There also is nothing very note worthy of it either, A very good representation of the style by a major BMC beer."
"Ultimately forgettable and disappointing. Not worth going out and getting."
"D: It's a ""drinkable beer"" not one that I would not drink it on a regular basis, but to be honest I would rather choose another beer to drink more often than this one."
"Brownish or perhaps amber color with a head of about a finger, recedes fairly quickly. Not too much in the aroma, a fairly 'clean' smell overall. Some sweetness immediately as well as some bitterness at the end. Maltiness is present as well, holding the beer together in a way. In terms of mouthfeel, carbonation is noticeable but not overwhelming and there is a bit of a smoothness to it. Overall, not bad at all but probably not something I'd go out of my way to buy again."
"When i poured this beer into my glass it had a nice 2"" white head that sat on top of a nice dark brown body. The aroma is not much but a little maltiness. The taste is nice and malty with a caramel and toffee taste. This beer is nice and smooth, not much else to talk about here other then a nice mouth feel and i think it is drinkable."
"Picked up a single at the grocery store... it pours out a nice deep mahogany color with a slight, quickly fading head. The nose is very bland, with just a faint maltiness. The flavor: well, there's absolutely zero Belgian yeast character. Instead, it's mostly sweet caramel, a touch of toffee, little else. If it had a little more bitterness, it'd make a nice competitor to Fat Tire, but it's not a Belgian-style beer by any means."
"This one wasn't too bad. It's nice, but nothing special. It's a dark brown with fairly low carbonation. The aroma was weak producing a tine amount of malty spices. Taste was decent, the spices and a touch of plumb and caramel had to be hunted down to be noticed. It's very smooth. Not an excessive amount of character here but it's nothing to turn away."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, a bit thin, and spritzy in the swallow."
"Pours a tawny color with light fan head. Looks good, but the love ends there. Nose is light to nonexistent with some faint caramel. Artificial-like caramel toffee candy on the palate through to the finish, almost sickly. Nutty aftertaste too with heaps of that god awful caramel. Fail."
"Verdict: I'm thinking that the potential of this beer has been overshadowed by the malts and wheat flavor. It isn't bad tasting, but needs much more than what it's giving to carry my interest. It isn't too sweet, but due to there not being much else here, it might be hard to tell otherwise. Prepare to share a six pack with a friend should you not enjoy this brew, which may be likely. For a select audience only. D+ (2.45)"
"D - Despite the name ""Winter Abbey Ale", this would be a great summer beer to quench your thirst after a mowing the lawn."
"Give this one to a newbie, or use it in the kitchen. Don't bother otherwise."
"Started a Winter Mini-Tour with this bottle. I wants my T-shirt! The liquid portion here pours a fairly clear ruby-brown topped by a finger of relatively short-lived off-white foam. The nose comprises caramel, honey, raisins, and a touch of rye bread. The taste holds notes of toffee, brown sugar, Belgian yeast, rye bread, raisins, a light chocolate-ness, and some musty wheat. It just doesn't come together quite right, you know what I mean? The body is a straight medium, with a moderate carbonation and a somewhat dry finish. Overall, a slightly sub-par dubbel, too bubbly, two sweet at times, and does not not finish well."
"The color when poured was of a medium reddish brown with white foam that dissapated quickly. But, there was some lace on the side of the glass. The smell was of roasted malts and a hint of spice, I think! The taste was of roasted malts with spices and a touch of rye. Not really my cup of tea, but, an OK ale. I just can't except it as a Dubbel! No Way!"
"It is really not bad. Enjoyable for the most part. Plenty of other options I will take over this, but you could do a lot worse."
"This is a pretty decent winter brew. I am glad to see that the Blue Moon label is trying to switch things up and bring out new brews with their seasonals. This is an expectedly consistent and fairly good beer. The aromas and tastes are straightforward and intentional. I hope that this beer is one that reaches out to people who don't normally branch out with their beer selections. Because of the Blue Moon brand, I think it has potential."
"D-the more you drink it, the more the belgian sugars come out, but still only slightly. its not a fun beer to drink. you'll regret buying a 6-pack."
"12/10 Edit to convert Drinkability (4.5) to Overall (3.75)"
"D: The beer is drinkable, but the taste wasn't interesting. I would definitely try another dubbel before having another one of these."
"An interesting winter beer - Better than regular Blue Moon, but still not one I'd pick myself."
"Easy enough to drink and not bad at all. I think a lot of people want to hate it because of who brews it but in all honesty there is nothing wrong with this beer."
"D- Easy to drink and I can appreciate trying to get BMC out of their box but this falls short"
"The beer pours a dark amber color with a thick frothy off-white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is average. It has a dry pale, roasted, and crystal malt scent along with a sweet candy sugar and Belgian yeast aroma. The taste is average as well. It has a dry, roasted malt flavor with a touch of caramel and candy sugar sweetness. There are some light yeast esters in the finish, but they're quite tame by Belgian standards. The mouthfeel is decent. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a pretty horrible example of a Belgian Abbey ale. It's not a bad drinker, but it's not in the same ballpark as a traditional example of the style."
"Avoid..."
"A very poor representation of the dubbel style, and not even that great of a beer to drink. Skip on this one if you see it."
"D- drain-pour. I would prefer Miller-lite over this."
"Overall, this a mild hybrid Belgian dubbel combined with a spicy English winter warmer."
"D- This beer is not strong or that flavorful so drinking a few of these in a row wouldn't be a chore but wouldn't be that enjoyable either. I don't think I will be buying this again any time soon. Blue moon shouldn't call this an abbey ale, its just a lack luster attempt at a dubbel."
"This beer was better than I'd expected. I didn't have very high hopes for it but it turned out to be pretty solid."
"Not much to say about this one other then it is pretty boring for a dubel. Nothing bad about it, but given the style its not striking, the malt isn't right, it doesn't have the characteristics one comes to expect of the style. It's essentially pretty boring."
"Drinkability: worth a try but dont expect to much. good kick, not bad for Coors, good enough to keep em coming. would not recommend over sam adams winter lager.."
"Smooth drinking, clean finishing. Probably session-able."
"I suspect this beer has never been near an actual Abbey, I'm not sure how they get away calling this an Abbey Ale. Perhaps this could be used as a training wheel example of the style for someone just discovering the style, otherwise avoid."
"I liked Full Moon better, but I think mostly because of the name. It's not fun to say abbey ale."
"D: easy drinking but I really thought that was all the beer had going for it."
"Not bad for Coors. I'm not sure this is better than regular Blue Moon, but ranks up there with the Sam Adams winter seasonal surprisingly. Just OK."
"Drinkability: Should be called Coors Special Dark, labeling this as an abbey beer is simply false advertising."
"Drink- Wasn't overtly bad but the mouth feel brought the total down."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkablitiy: Not overly carbonated making it easy to drink. There was not any lingering bad taste in my mouth when the beer was gone."
"It was OK. A little thin on the flavor and mouth feel. It could have been a lot better and I am disappointed since I really like Blue Moon as a day to day beer that everyone seems to like. It wasn't as good as regular Blue Moon and it was even less spiced that the Harvest Moon that was their pumpkin ale."
"M/D: Way too carbonated, needs more malts to thicken up this beer or a better yeast strain for some flavor complexity. An average beer, acceptable if its cheap, but there are a lot more better Dubbel's to drink."
"A good Dubbel in my opinion. Certainly unique and executed well. Flavors blend well with the mouthfeel. I would recommend this to others."
"It tastes pretty good for a product of Coors. I think they dialed in the brown sugar taste just right. It's not overpowering by any means. These go down nice and smooth, bringing out some nice holiday flavors and sweetness. No hoppy bitterness in this brew and I like that since there is no room for bitterness around Christmas time."
"Notes: i would consider this an entry level beer, naturally. i guess just like everything else they do. not bad, just not outstanding"
"While the Winter Abbey is drinkable, its probably not something I would come back to. The flavors never really came together for me, and there is a strong selection of seasonal ale's already out there."
"D:This isn't going to be a winter warmer for anyone so if the price is all that gets ya, go for it. There are nicer winter ales for about the same that are far more worth getting."
"Overall I enjoyed this beer but it was nothing spectacular. I was expecting it to be thicker and more filling after I read the description on the bottle, however I was pleasently surprised by the light and smooth feel. Would not be my 1st choice for a winter beer but def not my last either.(Note: 2010 Edition)"
"Drinkability: If there were more malt character this might be a decent brew."
"D: i can slam alot of these fast good for a winter beer that u wanna pound some but still have flavor but no where near a dubbel"
"I've always been a blue moon fan and this beer is not a bad beer. It doesn't stand out in any way, but a blue moon variety pack is worth getting because it is so readily available."
"I could buy something cheaper that tastes better, totally average, I really like Blue Moon, don't really mind that it's from Coors, but this one just tastes like it came off of the i don't care assembly line"
"The carbonation level is average, not too heavy, pretty much medium bodied. This is very drinkable except for the sweetness. If there was s light bitterness added to the end it would make it go down easier. Not something that needs to be sipped, it's not quite rich or heavy enough for that. Overall a decent beer."
"D: The dry carbonated finish is not quite like most Abbey Ales that I have had. One of the other posters said this was like an Abbey Ale on training wheels. That's exactly what I was thinking."
"Overall: I think I like this better than Belgian White to be honest. I'd never seen it before and would like some more!"
"Drinkability is ok as well. In my humble opinion, and going from memory, this does not stack up very well against the original offering but it's not a bad drop."
"From the 12 fl. oz. bottle no.APR2511-EO5031415. It pours a nice looking copper-amber with about a half inch of head that settles down. The carbonation is active at first but then also calms down. The aroma has a touch of yeast, toffee, sweet sugar, and malts. The taste is in the same vicinity with a sharp bitterness at the end. I think it needed more body."
"D - This is a marginal dubbel at best, where's the yeast, malt and alcohol? Even if you don't really define it as a style, I don't think I'll ever have one of these again. It's just marginally acceptable. I'm not pouring it down the drain, but I'll avoid it in the future."
"D: I wouldn't buy again. There are other great winter warmers out there. This one is ok, but I would choose another."
"Brilliant ruby in the glass with medium foam and carbonation. Dark caramel blends in with a subtle clove spice to make a wonderful cooked-raisin Christmas taste. Fruit esters linger with just a hint of roasted malt and lingering sweetness. Bottle says this is an Abbey ale, which it is not. The yeast may be a much-cleaned up version of a Belgian strain, accounting for the ""Abbey"" designation, but no matter! -- This beer is average in alcohol and medium in body, so the light esters and phenols (whether they come from the yeast or added spices) bring out dark crystal malts beautifully. Drinkability is far above-average for a Christmas beer, making this a Session Winter Warmer. Predictably, users have under-rated this beer because of its monolithic parentage, not because of the quality of the beer itself."
"Final Notes: I swear I remember this beer being better than this last year (this beer used to be called Full Moon). It must be my level of experience. It's actually a pretty good beer, but it's far from what you'd expect out of a Dubbel. I do enjoy this beer, but it doesn't belong in this style."
"D: Very high, but not satisfying."
"D/M: drinks smoothly enough, is a bit heavier than other abbey ales I've had, slight carbonation tingle. Leaves a bit of an unplesant taste on the pallet"
"One finger head that was gone in a few seconds, rats. Nice bubble ring left with some clinging lacing. Color is a 26 on the SRM beer color chart. Smell is sweet, with aromas of molasses, vanilla, caramel, roasted wheat, and malt. Flavors are mild hints of caramel, chocolate, toffee, coffee, and malt. Flavors change with each taste. Nice body, lots of fullness, and creaminess. I really like the flavor, but being it is seasonal, I won't try to make it a staple."
"Taste, dark fruit, very sweet, very smooth. Alcohol warmthto it, this beer seems to deliver more to style relatively than the other Blue Moon offerings. Ol' homegirl used to get tore up on it and still be pleasant, usually she'd be a raging out of control you know what, so this gives a real mellow drunk to chicks. It's got that going for it."
"I've come across this taste in a beer a few times. Its an easy to drink beer, but with no real sparkle. The flavor profile is a bit like Fat Tire. I like Fat Tire, but the two beer styles should be a bit different in taste. I tried this beer three different ways out of my six-pack: one cold, one warmer, and one in the bottle. It has an interesting flavor and a wonderful dark brown hazy color, but I don't think I'll be buying this one again. I think a bit more than a hint of Belgian sugar could do this beer a little justice. not bad though."
"As expected, nothing too extravagant."
"Belgian with training wheels and less complexity then us geeks would like. Good beer to entice some newbees or as a winter, lighter sessioner. Also would/will work in a marinade or holiday dish."
"Overall - appropriately flavorful winter ale. well above average. i will definately drink this one again."
"Blue Moon Brewing Company--Adolph J. Coors Brewing Company--Blue Moon Winter Abbey Ale--Seasonal Collection--Crafted With Belgian Sugar And A Touch Of Wheat. 2010 12 oz. Bottle. 5.60% ABV--10 IBU's.? (4.0 / 5.0) 6-Pack $5.99. No sediment. Mild lace foamy thin half inch white head. Clear fizzy pretty bright dark copper amber color. Toasted brown sugar mild Belgian Abbey wheat ester mild spice hop front. Pours thickish. Creamy rich mildly toasted Belgian dark candy mild cloying sweet smooth wheat hint body. Slightly cloying mild hop satisfying dark Belgian wheat end. Well made balanced & smooth. Sampled 11/16/2010."
"Overall - while it is not the most robust winter-style beer i have experienced, it has a great mouthfeel and a better than average drinkability (for the style). definitely worth a try."
"Russet amber with a creamy eggshell cap. Malty, caramel aroma. Sweet, caramel and I think I can taste a tiny bit of wheat, either that or the suggestion of added wheat on the label is influencing my palate. While not really a bad beer Blue Moon WAA is a pathetic excuse for a Dubbel or ""Abbey ale"" and really more of a run of the mill American amber ale. Medium light bodied and easy to drink."
"Good, but a bit faint for my liking. May drink again."
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a deep amber color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of malts, some hints of caramel. Taste is very mild, some malts, rather bland. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and has average drinkability. Overall this is a pretty good beer."
"Drinkability - Pretty decent in the taste, but I wish the complexities were a little less subtle so that one could really focus on them better. Not a bad brew though. Worth a six-pack."
"PS I should have been kinder to the appearance; it was probably my favorite part about this beer."
"Poured into a tulip. Pours a dark amber color with some reddish hues. Off-white head with a bit of lacing. The nose brings some caramel as well as hints of dark fruits and cherries, but mostly just caramel. The taste is lacking in complexity and while it's not a bad-tasting brew, it really pales in comparison to better examples of the style. Simply a bit of caramel with very light amounts of dark fruits and a hint of yeast. Feel is a bit full. Drinks fairly well, but just doesn't hit the right marks."
"The key to this beer --- let it warm up!"
"Drinkability is actually pretty good. It's off in areas for the style, but for what it is it's pretty tasty, and there's nothing offensive about it in the end. I'd easily take it if it were offered to me."
"Overall a good value for the price. But, not a world class dubbel. A good entry if your exploring beer options rather than the usual bud, mgd, coors fare. very sessionable."
"It's not that this is a bad beer but Coors really missed the mark in either the marketing or brewing department. Can't figure out which one."
"I am typically a Blue Moon fan. However, they seem to have missed the boat here a little bit. I saw a special on this at the store and picked up a 12 pack. I drank all 12 of these over a few days and one day with them was no better than the next. It pours and looks great in the glass. You have great expectations... and then you taste it. Nothing. Nothing grabs you. Nothing says have another. Nothing says buy this again. Where it the Belgian brown sugar... the smooth flavor or unique taste. It just seemed to lack any character or depth and definitely won't be on my list again."
"Not a bad beer, one I would happily drink again. Part of my like of this beer is that it is from Coors and it actually tastes decent enough for me to finish my bottle if not have a second. Perhaps a bit too sweet and not light enough for the style, but it aint half bad."
"A dubbel at 5.6 gets good drinkability points in my opinion, but too bad the flavor is lacking."
"Notes: Maybe a Belgian dubbel light. Won't be mistaken for an actual Belgian beer, but it isn't bad. For a Coors product it is pretty good. Demonstrates what flavors are in a dubbel (for the most part definitely lacking some, especially the yeast). The flavors are just a little watered down. Good beer to bridge Coors (and others) to good tasting beers."
"D- this wasnt really for me. i dont think ill be having another one of these any time soon."
"Drinkability is kind of bland not really a warmer but not to terrible bad just nothing great. Might be in choice in some restaurants where beer is limited. But not something I would try again."
"The flavor is a bit mild and weak for a Belgian dubbel. However, if you are new to craft beer you should enjoy this - a ""stepping-stone"" to better ales of the style."
"d: I was pretty dissapointed with this beer; i wouldn't try it if i were you"
"Drinkability: i'm not a huge malt fiend, so its not one of my top choices, but I will be sure to finish what I have."
"Taste: Simalar to the smell but with a little bit more of the wheat beet taste, Not bad but nothing exceptional either."
"Medium bodied with medium to high carbonation"
"It has a good carbonated mouthfeel, and it is very drinkable. Overall, I like this beer."
"M/D - A real drinkable medium bodied brew. Very smooth tasting seasonal from Coors or Miller/Coors or whatever their name is now. I well done seasonal that should be tried. Easy for me to have a couple in an evening"
"Buy Again? Probably not."
"It's malty, but dull. Bubbly carbonation...but nothing really special at all about this beer. I don't know, for the style of beer, I would say it's a weak effort."
"Drinkability isn't too bad, full flavor for the size, not strong or heavy"
"Finish is semi-dry with no lingering mouthfeel. Drinkable, but only in the sense that it is not off-putting. I certainly would not crave another of these, and wouldn't bother buying another."
"Drinkability: Easy drinker. Could put many of these away. I dont know how much different this would be in a glass so i would say its a pop and drink kind of beer for me."
"Not a flavor punch in the mouth that most dubbels tend to be, but it is easily drinkable as I could knock back a few of these, it's just nothing to savor and take your time with."
"Its funny to think back that use to be my go to beer, now its nothing short of an afterthought."
"Drinkability: It's drinkable, but I wouldn't recommend it. Perhaps it would be better if served from a tap."
"It's a blah beer overall, and I'd imagine most dubbels dwarf this selection. Though not horrible and a seemingly true representative of the style, it ain't to be sought after."
"Probably not a beer i would ever drink or even want to drink again."
"All in all, it's not a bad beer, but nothing I'd stock my fridge with."
"Drinkability - Not this year. Just did not taste good and will avoid in the future. There are many other Christmas beers I'd rather have than chance getting a bad sixer of these again next year."
"D: average in limited moderation. You would be hard press to guess this was brewed by Coors. Sweet, but I would have no problem having a second one, but 3 may be pushing it. Worthy a single purchase."
"D - definitely could session this one"
"Rather disappointing offering from an otherwise respectable label (even if it is Coors in disguise). The yeast used here is inappropriate, distracting, and has an overall negative impact on the final product. As you would expect from this brewery, the product was clean, no off-flavors or tastes due to contamination, but the flavor profile was a train-wreck. If you're going to brew a Belgian dubbel, which this is characterized as, have a yeast that produces the proper esters, and malt to match it. I won't bother with my usual BJCP grading by category, as i don't believe this offering merits it. The Blue Moon clone of Hoegaarden is at least on-point. This beer, whatever it may be, is not."
"Poured into a standard pint. Clear light mahogany color with a large fizzy head that disapates rapidly. Almost no lacing to speak of. Smelled great very rich and malty. Unfortunantly that aroma did not carry over in the taste which was on the weak side. It drinks OK and for a novist it might be a good jumping off beer for an abby Belgian but very weak for a seasoned drinker."
"D. Not a great brew but I would drink this brew again. It kind of reminded me of cream soda, I think this would appeal to people who like a sweeter less hopped beer."
"Overall, this beer was an interesting try, but not one I'd get again, unless it was a cold winter's day."
"Drinkability is pretty good. While certainly not a great example of the style, it is a pretty easy drinking brew and would be a decent session beer. Not amazing but I wouldn't mind having it again."
"D: i'm not a huge malt fiend, so some darker belgians, get a little cloying for me. this not at all, but the mediocre flavor means ill hardly be raring to finish the sixpack."
"I enjoy this beer and would buy it again."
"Notes: Not a bad Winter beer. Still I think it's a case of Coors being afraid to offend. Amp up the sweet flavors of this brew to something big and bold and we're looking at a decent small Belgian beer."
"As a representation of a dubbel, this brew lacks heavily. As an inoffensive, inexpensive, mass-marketed ""craft"" interpretation of an abbey ale, a bit warming and easily accessible, Full Moon excels. Nowhere in the realm of bad beer, for sure."
"This is an ok tasting beer, but if you've had any higher quality Dubbel's you will understand that calling Full Moon a Dubbel is not quite right. For 8 bucks a six back though its a mild, pleasantly drinkable beer."
"Drinkable, but it does not stand out."
"I guess if you want anything good from Blue Moon...you might as well get Blue Moon, which is still mediocre at best."
"CHEERS!"
"Poured a clearish brown w/ a gigantic frothy tan head on top of a mild malty smell w/ a little sweetness. Light bodied, with hints of caramel malt along with some barely noticeable spice and hop bitterness. Finishes clean and smooth. Not bad for a macro, but garbage if you're looking for a true Belgian ale."
"D: This is an OK session brew. It's by no means a Dubbel, in the traditional sense of the style. Too light and low in alcohol for that. A decent beer, but not one I'd seek out in the future."
"Drinkability> I wouldn't throw it back in your face, but if you had something else in your fridge, I'd probably take it."
"D - I was a bit disappointed with this beer. However, until reviewing this beer I had no idea Coors brewed this so I guess the joke is on me. I couldn't see myself having too many of these in a sitting."
"It's easy to drink and could be a good cross over beer. Someone new to craft beer would enjoy this. What gets my pannies in a wad is they Blue Moon(Coors) advertise this as an Abbey Ale. There is nothing Abbey about it."
"Out of a bottle this beer was a ruddy amber color with a two finger, off-white head. The retention of the foamy cap was pretty good and the lacing in thin curtains that eventually became tiny spots. The aroma was of Belgian yeast and lights spices. The flavors were or citrus hops, Belgian yeast and macro grains. Acidic and tart with a strange finish that unfortunately threw the whole thing off a bit. The mouthfeel was rough, the body medium and the carbonation high. Cleary a mega-brewery product and not possessed of the finesse Blue Moon shows."
"12 oz brown bottle obtained at Hannaford's Supermarket Derry, NH. Copper in color with a nice half inch of off white head that sadly dissipated too quickly. sweet smell of toffee, caramel, a lil bit of a brown sugaryness with a slight dark chocolate undertone. biscuity taste with caramel and toffee and brown sugar. light/moderate mouthfeel. this beer is very pallatable."
"the fact that its light with a mild taste makes it a easy drink you don't tire from. may not be highly rated but it was enjoyable."
"D - Moderately drinkable beer - nothing over the top here that makes it difficult to drink. Overall however, it is somewhat boring."
"Overall, this beer is a dubbel that won't spook your everyday macro-brew fan. nothing jumps out at you with alot of flavor and the body is too light to be a dubbel by my standards"
"Notes: This was a very simple example of a Belgian Dubbel."
"Well...take it or leave it."
"Final Thoughts: Dull and uninteresting. Only buy if you want to try the whole Blue Moon lineup."
"Would recommend and would like if this was available all year round, instead of a seasonal beer. The best of the ""blue moon"" group"
"D: I bought this beer as part of a Blue Moon mix pack that also contained the Pale Moon and Blue Moon. I found the Full Moon to be by far my favorite of the bunch. I enjoy the combination of flavors and the ease of drinkability. I would recommend giving this a try and would certainly welcome another."
"Overall, I was surprised by this beer. Its complexity took me by surprised and should be complimented, but the way the flavors blended may it very just disjointed and not very sessionable. Although in the end it is probably one of the least expensive of this style of beer and may be worth a try."
"D: I wish this was a better bodied beer. I like the sweetness, just want it more smooth/mellow. Too darn fizzy..."
"Overall a great product from Coors as it was pretty close to the other dubbel I have had. It is pretty easy to drink and I'd definitely pick it up again at the sale price I got it at."
"Drinkability is ok, you could have several of these. But why would you want to?"
"I haven't had Blue Moon in a couple of years, but I remember liking it. This stuff, however, I won't drink again."
"Really not trying to hate on the BMCs, but diarrhea makes it all too easy."
"Drinkability: Goes down smooth, easy to drink. Can finish a six pack with drinking time to spare"
"Reddish brown with off white rather large head (I put forth an aggressive pour). Almost nonexistent aroma, picking up some sugar, molasses, and some offensive aroma that I can't quite pin down. Definitely made by Coors, it seems like old sugar and synthetic syrup made their way into the Coors Light bottles and they decided to just call it a winter ale. Extremely light in body and fizzy mouthfeel. After a few sips the overwhelming Sweet N Low packets start to stale the taste and turn me off. There's no balance in this brew, just malt and dark sugar water."
"Easy to drink, probably too easy for the kind of beer it is trying to be."
"Overall: The beer mouth feel is slightly carbonated and sweet. The body of the beer is medium. The finish is slightly bitter. The beer is an okay beer there is not a lot of body and complex malt in the beer. The spice is muted and so is the citrus. It is not a terrible beer but it is no where near a great one."
"Again, it's not a terrible beer. It is drinkable but disappointing considering it's wonderful appearance."
"Pours a very clear, amber brown color. Frothy light tan head, good lacing, lasting. Malty fresh aroma, but weak. Fresh clean taste, malty, watery. Some spice on the finish. Weak flavor. Letting it warm up. More spice but still bland."
"D - this is low on my list of favorite dubbels."
"Pretty solid atmosphere, in particular the nose. Hearty roasted flavor and feel. Really pleasant to drink. Good quaff."
"Really drinkable though! It's pretty easy to crush a bunch of these if you needed to. Wouldn't do it again for a one beer night though...bland and boring."
"It's kind of pleasant. It could be much better if they'd take a chance and amp up the flavor a bit. But I guess they have to appeal to their target consumers; the average macro drinker who's palate might be offended by flavorful beer."
"Medium bodied, fairly drinkable. A decent winter brew."
"Drinkability: At some bars this is the best choice, a little heavy on the candy sugar. Certainly not great, but not bad either; some people se Coors and can't give anything other than ""F"."
"Drinkability: It's no dubbel, that's for damn sure, but I guess you gotta shove it somewhere. However, it did pair well with the flick It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World. It does have that going for it."
"Draught: This one poured a somewhat reddish-brown color. It was also fairly clear. Unfortunately, it was poured into a heavily frozen/frosted mug, so I can't judge or lacing. The aroma was a bit light. Some sweet malts and spices. The taste was a little light. It was a little tasty, and certainly not offensive to anyone. Some sweet caramel malt and spices. Not bad, but it is a dumb-downed dubbel."
"I could definitely have a few of these but for the price its nothing special. Might get it again, but not in the near future."
"Poured a weird orange colorwith no head. Nose smells rather weak. Lightly flavored with some caramel sweetness and an interesting spicing on the finish. The body is very thin and weak. Mouthfeel is watery with some malts and hops and a tad bit of caramel. Bad excuse for a Warmer."
"Not bad. Reminds me of a watered down dubbel. Pretty sessionable."
"Dubbels are not really my gig, but this one is not a horrible stab at the style by an American macro."
"Sad to see this guy retire. A nice offering from Blue Moon and formerly available even where most other offerings were quite frightening. A nice dark honey pour with light beige head that clung nicely to the glass dissipating from a 1 finger width. A nice, basic spiced-orange & nut malt aroma that opened to include a lemon-hop zesty flavor upon tasting. A good, decent Christmas-time ale that only made Coors' ""wee division"" a little bit better."
"Drinkability is very poor, i'm debating of even finishing this one."
"Ultimately, a beer that could be very good but seems like it is just too weak. It's like the taste was siphoned out of it."
"I won't be having another this year, but I might revisit it next winter to see if there is any improvement."
"Pours a deep ruby color with an average foam head that stays a very short while. It dies quick, and retains no lacing. It's weak on flavor, but, it's a bit better than I antisipated from Coors. A very mild hop bitterness, with a little bit of spices in it. It has weak mouth feel, and not enoigh carbonation for my taste. No real high class ""body"" This ale is nothing to rave about."
"D-Decently drinkable. Not a spectacular beer, not overly complex (especially considering the style), but still an enjoyable drink. I'd drink it again in the future, though I won't be searching for it."
"Sorry....I do not recommend, this is an atrocious example of a Belgian beer."
"I feel bad, having enjoyed previous offerings from this company. It won't in any way influence my decision to have another beer from Blue Moon, but I wouldn't touch this one again even if you threatened to make me listen to you strangling my first born to death."
"Very drinkable."
"Not to bad, but also probably not a beer I would buy again. It was worth a try though, and I could see some people really liking this a lot depending on your taste."
"Drinkability would be through the roof if this tasted(had any taste)better."
"Ok so this is about what I expected. Appearance is meh, straw yellow, no real head or lacing. Smell and taste are quite similar- very clean tasting, a touch of hops and barley any malt taste. Mouth feel is too weak, even for a belgian pale. Drinkability is good, but only because the taste and mouthfeel are weak."
"I can't say I'd return to this one again any time soon, but points for the effort. At least the ""Blue Moon"" line is trying something new to appeal to the masses. That is, after all, who they're after much more than the beer geeks who might have issues with this beer posing as a style it just doesn't match."
"D - I like this a lot. I know the reveiws aren't as good as this overall but I like it."
"A pretty good beer overall. A little overcarbonated. Certainly an option for those nights when you have some leftover after your parents are in town and you just want something nice and light (me, by the way). I cant say I would seek this out but I would certainly drink this again if given an opportunity, and nothing better is available."
"Drinkability: Not wretched, but not great. I'll probably not buy it again, but if a friend offered me one, I'd drink it."
"D- Can probably only drink a couple of these in a sitting. A little too bitter for it to be a session beer."
"Drinkability: Not a favorite of mine, nor a beer that I would actively seek out. It is easy drinking but doesn't have the complexity nor body I am looking for in a winter ale. Of the twelve, this will probably be my only sample...the rest will be drank by my girlfriend or at a party."
"Drinkability was good if you like sweet beers. Tastes like many of the ""winter warmers"" I have had this year."
"mouthfeel is light, crisp, slightly roasty... leaves much to be desired."
"D: Not too bad, especially for Coors. I'd drink it if I was in macroville."
"drinkability- this was easy to drink but overall there was no WOW factor."
"Not recommended."
"I liked this a lot the first time I tried it, so I bought a couple more. Its taste isn't different from when I first had it. I don't know why I liked it so much. Its not bad, and I can certainly have more than one. But its not complex enough. Goes down way too well with very little...flavor. Worth a try, but not stellar."
"I think I rated this fair for what it is."
"Food: Was most excellent compliment with hearty sweet garlic spaghetti."
"Strikes me as a strange mix between an abbey ale and a blue moon----huh maybe thats cause it is! crazy stuff. Ok, Ok it isn't a trappist brew, and it would shudder in the presence of a westmalle or a Rochefort, but it kicks the hell out of blue moon, that being said, there are much better ways to spend your hard earned cash."
"D- Another alright Blue Moon Seasonal. It is drinkable and just slightly more alcohol than Blue Moon. However I'd stick to other beers over this."
"D- Other then not being to style, but very roughly to style (1 grain sand paper rough), this does drink well for a 'beer'."
"D - This is a good beer to share with friends and family that are accustomed to drinking macro brews. The mild flavor makes it easy to drink a few, but don't expect a lot of complexity."
"D - Pretty high but not much flavor. Kind of falls in to the Fat Tire, Sam Adams category for me. More of the micro impersonation you would expect."
"I grabbed one out of the cooler and figured why not try it. Not horrific, but not great. Pass."
"Taste: Like a brown ale with a sorta brown sugar taste. Not bad, but it's kinda boring and not very complex."
"Notes: Fair offering from Coors. More interesting than the Pale Moon but not as good as Blue Moon."
"D: Unlike BMWheatsbeers...I can't drink these very fast, or do more than two of them...too sweet or something else. Just not as pleasant a brew. Still not bad..I just was expecting better."
"D - Fairly average drinkability: the presentation is mellow and uneventful, much like a cheap beer."
"The aroma is sweet with some macro twang corn malt, brown sugar, and a tiny bit of toast. The appearance is light brown with a small head. The flavor is like the aroma. The palate is thin. The aftertaste is cloying yet astringent. Overall I don't care much for this one."
"Decent is the best way to sum up this beer. Good balance, but low on firepower."
"I can stomach this beer and I'm glad I bought a six pack as I feel the need to try almost every beer I see, but I won't be picking this beer up until next year when I've forgotten what it tastes like."
"D: This goes down easy but mainly because it has no character. Too many better Belgian ales out there."
"Full Moon Winter Ale pours a dark reddish copper with an off white head from a brown twelve ounce bottle. The aroma is mild, a bit malty. The flavor is very mild, sweet and malty. Pleasant enough, but not the least bit challenging. Better than a standard macro lager."
"Would not recommend or purchase again."
"Overall average dark beer a little too bitter for me, was not expecting that from this beer."
"For some reason, I expect more since Blue Moon is a decent beer and they seem to try but just cannot seem to get any of the other seasonals right."
"Reviewed on: 11-08-2008 00:12:41"
"Bottle. Pours clear dark brown, mahogany in fact, with a small, frothy, off-white to light brown head, somewhat lasting with fair lacing. Aroma is heavy malt (cookie, bread, caramel), light to non-existent hops, average yeast (leaves, dough, cheese) with notes of dates, brown sugar, and wet paper sacks. Medium bodied, sticky texture, lively carbonation, and a metallic finish. Average duration, moderate sweetness, light acidity and bitterness. Not a bad beer, and certainly warms the holiday mood. It is nice to see such a large brewer buck the norm and go for a less mainstream style."
"Mouthfeel is also a tad weak. A little too watery. Good carbonation though. Overall, I've enjoyed the seasonals from Blue Moon, and this is no exception. I would drink this again."
"Overall, I'd call this Abbey Ale Light. They need to put more of everything into this beer."
"D: It's not bad by any means. Some nice flavors are present, just in a watery/moderate fashion. It's very drinkable and certainly sessionable, which is probably what they were aiming for. You could do worse, but it's nothing to rave about."
"Drinkability: Heavy at first, but as I worked my way down the glass, I did not feel the same way. Between 1 and 3 is how much I would probably be willing to drink in a row."
"Pours a hearty looking dark black and has a sweet smell to it. Overall flavor is a bit subdued but still has some of the Belgian sugars being noticeable and the mouthfeel and body are excellent. Could use a tad more in the actual taste department but this beer was super easy to drink and went down smooth... a nice winter seasonal."
"Not a bad beer overall and worth the purchase. It was a bit light overall for this style, but a good beer to introduce others to other tastes out there."
"D - An OK brew, but like most of Blue Moon's seasonals, it falls short. Not bad, but entirely forgettable."
"mouthfells suprise suprise is thin as hell too, its a decent tasting session beer, but its no "" abbey ale"""
"Drinkability: Pretty easy to session but the taste wouldn't make that possible. Alot of these so-called Winter's should just be left untouched, because years ago, I can remember this beer actually being pretty quaffable, not anymore. Besides the appearance, this beer is pretty forgettable. Coors needs to go back to the drawing board and fix the blandness and the horrid, grassy smell this beer emits."
"Pours a solid brown color with amber highlights at the edges, tight off-white head that settled into a sparse cap. The aroma is of a light roasted malt and sweet candi sugar. The taste is of light roasted malt, grainy, enough dark candi sugar to balance out the grainy flavor. Definitely a BDA in 2008, it appears that they may have changed the style over last year, according to the reviews. The feel is moderate with prickly carbonation, quite balance perhaps tipping towards the sweet end. Not a terrible abbey ale, has some roasted flavor and sweetness but lacks the belgian yeast spice. Easily drinkable."
"Poured into a chalice. Nice clear brown look with a tight head. Carbonation is fair. The head dissipates rather quickly. The aroma is of sweet candi sugar, caramel malt, and a bland brand of dried fruit. The taste is a little weak with the first couple of sips, but then after half a glass the flavors of chocolate, sweet malt, and slight tartness come through. The body is a little weak. The coating of the mouth and slick aftertaste hide the body after the first brew. A great session beer that I would drink at least every winter/fall."
"D--Big time. Certainly an entry-level beer if you are curious about climbing the ""Belgian"" ladder. At 5.6% ABV it is VERY sessionable, smooth and enjoyable. Not a challenging beer, but definitely knock some back watching Thanksgiving football!"
"Notes: For the style it claims to be inspired by it does no justice to the brew. Not nearly enough character or complexity. I would not bother with this one again and not because it was horrible,just because it lacked soul."
"MF&D - A little on the watery side, but not bad. Lacks the flavor of a true Abbey Ale, but not bad in a pinch. Better then I had expected it to be. I would drink this again."
"M/D: I like it. Label tells of a hint of ""Dark Belgian Sugar", and I do taste that..Not sure of the ABV, but, I can certianally down more than one of these."
"D: Easy enough, but not special enough to want more."
"D: It's definitely drinkable, especially at $6 a sixer. If you're looking for a real Belgian Style, pass on this one. But if you want a cheap session ale with a nice macro malt flavor, stop and collect six."
"This ale pours a clear golden color and has a thin whitish head with poor retention. The nose has grainy malts and a light sweetness. No real citrus or spicy aromas. The taste is also a bit lacking for the style. Sweet malts and grassy hops. The light body has considerable carbonation. I thought the older version was better."
"Overall, this beer was better than I expected from Coors, but much less than I expect from a beer billing itself as a ""Belgian Abbey Ale."" I have mixed feelings about this one, but wouldn't pick it up off the shelf over many good craft brews unless it was at a significantly lower price point."
"Presentation: Packaged in a twelve ounce brown glass bottle with a twist-off crown, packaged in a standard pint tap glass."
""
"This isn't the best winter ale I've had but it was worth a shot. Pours a dark auburn color with a meager head that fizzles quickly. Smells of wheat, hint of cinnamon, bready. Tastes of weak spices like the brewer accidentally dropped some in. Didn't exactly ""warm"" me."
"This poured a clear, dark amber with light tan head. It smelled very faintly of blended malt and yeast. Its taste was more pronounced than its scent, with noticeable malt and sour apple flavors mixing with slightly bitter hops and some brown sugar sweetness. It was watery with slight carbonation and a sweet aftertaste. Overall this was a very clean and interesting beer. Surprisingly good!"
"This is my first winter ale of the year. A deep amber colored body hosts a light tan head that has lots of rocky fat crackling bubbles that stand two fingers tall. It has decent retintion. Nose is a fresh raw mix of wheat, soft cinnamon, yeasty dough with an overall spicey feel. Peppery wheat hit the tongue and carry a timid but consistant spicey feel throughout the palate. A hue of ginger and cinnamon is all over the mouth and carry a bit of sweetness. A slight hint of hops are noticeable twords the finish bringing a little balance and bitter. Could use a little more malt balance. Mouthfeel is very thick with a dry sugared bitter. This isnt bad, just not special at all. Average Drinkability."
"This beer is not all I thought it was going to be. I am a fan of regular ol' Blue Moon, but this doesn't do much for me. The smell I would say is only a hair above opening a Miller Light. Not too good. Taste is sweet, but finishes like a Miller Light. Just for reference, I hate Miller Light. It is drinkable though and not terrible by any means. Its a good beer to get drunk on, not to drink for the sheer purpose of taste. I would probably buy it again. Maybe."
"Overall: Too sweet. Avoid"
"Music enjoyed whilst sampling: Blue Moon by Elvis"
"Good beer for someone trying to branch out of the big brand pilsners and looking for a mellow beer without too much going on."
"D - A fair attempt, yet just average for a winter seasonal IMO. I expect a lot more for a belgian style winter ale. This is drinkable, but there are so many other better choices. Just not my thing - I would still drink this if it was the only seasonal option."
"Probably more of a winter warmer than a belgian ale. Rereshing. Very middle of the road."
"Watery but a bit creamy. Slightly bubbly feel. Not bad overall. A bit too sweet in parts for my taste."
"Poured a hazy, coppery hue straight out of the bottle with a fluffy, creamy head, about two-fingers. Scents of oak, dried fruits and coriander wafted up to my nostrils. Taste was pretty decent, heavy maltose sweetness with just a hint of bittering hops. Reminded me of dried fruits in the nose and taste. Mouthfeel dissipated quickly. Not a bad brew at all. Very sessionable, but then again doesn't stand out among other excellent winter ales."
"Full Moon Winter Ale is okay beer that is close to earning the next highest flavor score. It has no business being called a Belgian *anything*, but then you already knew that. Kudos to the brewery for trying to straddle the divide that exists between their usual customers and us beer geeks."
"Pours a medium amber color with a very faint but consistent head. Fair amount to very little lacing on the glass. Smell is sweet with a hint of mild malts and alcohol. The taste is also sweet, malty, and a little bit fruity. A tad too much carbonation in my opinion--a little less, and I think this would be a better beer. That said, it's easy to drink and has a little bit of a kick to it. Nothing to write home about, but very solid."
"Overall Impression: Total package just isn't pleasing. Pass."
"I must admit I almost didn't buy this beer. I was expecting a thin watery sweet beer with a nice wintery label. Although not my favorite overall this is a nice refreshing beer for a winter warmer, if you want to call it that. But this is a nice change from my thick stouts in the winter. I'll buy it again."
"D- Not so great I probably won't have another."
"The beer poured a basic amber with a light tan head. The aroma is light, but of spiced malt. The taste is basically sweet malt. The feel is light and dry. I bought a six pack and had a hard time getting to this last one. I had hoped for more when I saw this beer was out. It was really pretty weak and even lacked the signature Coors malt and yeast tastes which I do like."
"Actually a very good beer for the price and one worth trying. Definately could drink quite a few at a sitting, although I'll prefer Sam Adams or Anchor if I have a choice."
"This is a decent beer that is drinkable. I recommend anyone taste it."
"Drinkability: An easy enough drinker, a winter warmer you could session with if you wanted too. If this beer is released again next year I will probably purchase again, if not, well, I'm glad I got to try it at least once. Pretty decent."
"To be fair, this is not a beer for the learned palate. It can be refreshing and fine, but not a belgian gustatory orgasm."
"The drinkability is average as I could drink maybe 3 of these."
"While not a heavy ""winter warmer"" this is a decent beer that gets too much bad press because of the parent company... perfect to session especially with a friend who might not be that adventurous with new beers!"
"It's disappointing when every other Blue Moon beer out there comes out, you get all excited and than it tastes just like generic beer. I'm kinda insulted by it, why do something interesting and dare I say trailblazing and then turn around and churn out craft beer labeled bottles filled with pretty much shit. Appears a clear light amber hue with a large off white head forming fine even lacing as it dwindles nice look let's take a smell. Aromatics a muted grainy sweetness touch of spiciness and generic beer scent no real hop factor arising. Flavor touch of caramel sweetness with a grainy lingering quality that turns sour, dark Belgian sugar whatever dude this tastes like candy corn and caramel popcorn. Not impressed weak and one dimensional in nature. Mouthfeel is thin and overly carbonated you can actually tell just from the pour the way the foam forms and dissipates. Light to medium nothing really artificial Co2 floods the palate. Drinkability is a one and done analyze this type situation, no more needs to be said."
"This beer is really lacking in taste. Most winter beers are full of auroma and flavor. I think that they were afraid to make a beer too flavorful because some people might not like it."
"Taste is very dry and bitter. With burnt caramel that has a sour tang to it. Tastes like over roasted or almost burnt malt. Unfortunately, I was not very impressed with this winter ale."
"Drinkability wasn't good as it has no real festive flavor, or even flavor in fact, to continue drinking this brew. I would recommend finding almost anything else to replace this. Overall, the beer tries but doesn't execute."
"More than a little disappointing."
"Watered down beer with citrus leanings and a slight touch of sweetness. Not worth drinking again."
"D - To summarize, this beer is pretty bland, and wouldn't even make a good introduction to a winter seasonal for a non beer lover. There are plenty of other winter seasonals out there for the same price...do yourself a favor and try one of those instead."
"Drinkability - Easy drinking beer, seems last years beer was a winter warmer. They changed the name from Winter Ale, to Full Moon Winter Ale. Get rid of the screw cap!"
"I was really expecting more from this beer..."
"Not undrinkable, but too mild/lackluster. Doesn't fit with Belgian nor with winter so well, IMO."
"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, beer is an orangish-amber color with a two-finger, bubbly, creamy looking head. Looks sort of watery sitting in the glass. Smell is not overwhelming, slightly sweet with a hint of brown sugar and possibly vanilla. Taste is also slightly sweet, but not cloying - the brown sugar is slightly noticeable. Smooth finish, medium mouthfeel with adequate carbonation. Overall, a decent beer - nothing to write home about but not offensive either."
"This beer puts up big losing points where it counts most...too bad. The flavor is unattractive from every angle. The sweetness promised by the ""Dark Belgian sugar"" is muted; the yeast is hiding; the malts seem dead; the metallic character of the aroma comes out even stronger in the flavor. In general it's just a mess. Having had several over the past week, I now know that I will never, ever buy this one again. Not even in a pinch."
"Pours slightly hazy, orange-amber with a decent head that lingers well. Aroma is juicy malt, raisins and some alcohol, but faint. Flavor is watery, some dark fruit malts and some alcohol. Not bad, but not great. Overall kind of what you would expect from Coors, but worth a try."
"No alcohol sting or warming for that matter."
"This beer is medium in carbonation and body. Worth a try, not a bad winter offering from Blue Moon."
"cheers!"
"This beer poured a clear brown with a big head Â– tight bubbles, but quickly dissipating head. The smell is hoppy and a bit spicy, but not strong. The taste is bitter and a bit sweet. There is a spicy quality to the taste. The mouthfeel is somewhat shy of medium, but seems suited. Overall, this isnÂ’t a bad offering from Blue Moon Â– itÂ’s at least worth a shot."
"This is a very accessible beer and would be one to have in the fridge this season for those who are beginning to approach different beer styles and flavors. For the students of the traditional Belgium brewing methods and varieties this may not hit the mark. The bottle had an expiration stamp of March 9th, 2008."
"On draught at Winking Lizard in Columbus. Pours a clear copper color with a medium thin and foamy off-white head that dissipates steadily. Sticky patches of lacing. Mild aroma of grain, spice and fruit. Light effervescent body with a subtle malt and spice character. Light nuts and dough in the flavor as well. The finish is mildly spiced and leaves a nutmeg and malt aftertaste. Does not meet my expectation of what an Abbey Dubbel should be, but does meet my expectation of CoorsÂ’ expectation of what an Abbey Dubbel should be."
"Don't expect your typical Belgian abbey but it's pretty good stuff."
"Overall: If you're new to microbrews you'll probably like this. If you're into authentic Belgian beers, you probably won't. Nothing awful, but nothing special either."
"Pours a mild amber color with little if any head. Aroma is mostly spice and raisin on the nose. Taste is somewhat sweet and bitter at the same time. Tastes like any other macro beer. I can't really find anything impressive in this beer except that the spices fade towards the back of the tongue. Maybe it's something I'm not detecting but at the same time, this beer is quite unimpressive."
"This one isn't bad, but could be much better. Pull back the arsenal of flavour and simplify it by bringing out one or two key flavours and balancing them well. Give it a try I guess but don't expect much."
"d: A dumbed down dubbel that may be good for newbies or those looking for a different ""let's get drunk"" beer, but little else. Its an okay beer, I could put down many of them thanks to its lack of flavor and watery consistency, but calling it a dubbel is a bit of a stretch. A decent effort by MolsonCoors and Co. that seems to fit in with the rest of the Blue Moon label."
"This beer poured a copper color with a single-finger off white head. The smell is a little sweet maltiness, although it's a little faint. The taste reflects the smell with a lot of malty sweetness up front, followed just a tiny bit of hops. This is a nice drinkable beer with a fairly average mouthfeel with lots of carbonation."
"Not much smell to speak of but for a sweet malt background. Color is a very pale translucent brown. Head is there but not for too long. Taste starts out sweet then immediately has a flat bitterness followed by a sweet malty finish. Carbonation seems high and without it the brew doesn't seem to have much backbone. No flavors really stand out. This is usually served with an orange slice and that probably adds the flavor it lacks. Not much of a statement maybe trying to please too many."
" ~ This is the last of a six pack that I purchased about 2 months ago. Let's just say I wasn't very anxious to review this one. I can't see myself going out of my way to try it again either."
"I now understand why reviews were all over the place."
"probably worth a six pack every december."
"Not a bad offering. One of the more better holiday drinks."
"D - Probably won't buy more than the six-pack, but its not a bad beer, about average."
"I thought this wasn't a bad beer at all. Now, it wasn't the best Dubbel I've had, but for a macrobrewery, it's pretty good. I thought it had a nice warming taste, with hints of brown sugar, faint spices, a faint ""kiss"" of the hops, and good caramel taste as well. I thought it looked pretty damn good in the glass after I poured it. It had a solid/thick head on it that lasted for a long time afterwards. To me, you can't ask for much more than that. Overall a nice beer from the big guys. At least they are making something other than the swill they usually put out. Who knows, some poor unsuspecting ""joe schlub"" might be turned onto different styles after having this. I think it's a great tool to get people to try different beers."
"Overall, it's OK, but somewhat of a letdown."
"Not much to recommend here. Take Blue Moon, add some extra crap and call it a new beer. Inferior to the regular beer."
"This beer pours a golden amber/copper color, with a creamy head. That left, good lacing all the way down the glass. The taste was a fairly decent. Not quite the full bodied flavor that the label promises. The overall smell reminded me of caramel characteristics. And the mouth feel with light, with a decent carbonation. All in all the drinkablity of this beer is good at best. You kind of expect more, but the beer leaves you a little less than impressed. I could drink this one agian very easily, but probably won't just becuase I know there is way better out there"
"Overall, tastes like a Herman Joseph's dosed with sugar at bottling. Not recommended."
"Clear, medium amber with a thin beige head. Nose of pastry dough - like a powdered donut without the powder. The first sips revealed grainy wheat husk/ hull flavors with a little candy sugar, but the body is all wrong; sliding around from medium to light and back again. This tastes like someone made a half-n-half with Chimay Red and Coors Original. I want to say it was a decent attempt, but the finish has a hint of depressing pizza from a Delaware beach town."
"Not a bad beer. It probably won't get the credit it deserves because it is a blue moon product, but I like it and could make a session out of it easily."
"Central American Lager meets Winter Warmer? That's what this seems like. It has a slightly warming alcohol feel, with some malty spices, but seems to be made out of a corn base. I guess it's decent enough for ""just a beer to drink", but really not worth the money."
"they really need to step it up with these seasonal offerings."
"Pours a clean orange-ish/ copper color with an off white head. In the aroma, dry wheaty, and hints of sweet citrus/ orange. In the taste, same as smell, a dry wheatiness, hints of a sweet orange flavor, very much like a Belgian wit. A smooth, decent bodied mouthfeel and a dry sticky sweet aftertaste. Light, and very much like a Belgian wit style."
"12oz bottle poured into a pint glass. Pours an orangish amber color with an off-white head with good retention that leaves a pretty decent amount of lacing. The aroma is pretty faint with some roasted malts and a touch of spices with not much else. The taste much like the aroma is pretty flavorless and on the watery side. There is some roasted malts and spices with just a hint of hops in the finish. Overall, this is a pretty weak and flavorless seasonal that I would not recommend."
"D - Not bad. A descent attempt by Coors at a Belgian-style beer."
"D: Not a bad winter beer from Coors, interesting that they made an abbey style beer, but only put it at 5.6%, they should have gone for a more alcoholic brew, IMO, all and all, a fair beer, but not something I'll go back to, with so many great Winter Warmers on the market."
"Good for Coors product. Nice and sweet aroma also detected in the taste. That Belgian brown sugar that the label boasts about must be the reason. Not too thick... pleasant consitancy and good carbonation. Nice head and lacing and easy to drink. Good beer taste-for-the-price ratio."
"Drinkable enough but not a real good abbey. There are better beers out there for the money."
"The label on the bottle is what drew me to this one more than anything; all cozy in a snow covered cabin. The brew isn't stellar, but it's worth a look, like the other Blue Moon ""seasonals."""
"Pours with a five finger white head fading quickly to a thin layer and leaving some lace. Nice crystal clear amber color. The nose is slightly malty. Medium carbonation and medium body. Flavor is a balance of malts, sugar and hops. Clean finish. $1.50 for 12oz bottle from Capitol Convenience, Concord, NH. Label says this is brewed by BMBC in Toronto, Canada."
"Pours a burnt orange color with a generous amount of thick and creamy off white head. Smell is of sweet malt, and dried fruits with some raisin, prune type scent and lots of grains which was weird for this style. Taste is rich in grain flavor with a copper like strange bitter finish. Watery mouthfeeling with a fruity like after...after taste."
"Pours a crisp pale orange with a thin off-white head that quickly diminishes to a ring. Aroma was some caramel malt with a hint of spice. Taste was caramel with some cinnamon and nutmeg, even a hint of vanilla. The beer was light and crisp with low carbonation. This one is somewhat enjoyable, but there are many better winter brews out there."
"D-I COULD PROBABLY DRINK A COUPLE ,BUT WOULD NOT PURCHACE AGAIN"
" This would make a great session beer, even though the ABV % is over 5.0. It has a nice finish to it, a mellow, yet lingering aftertaste, and is neither too thick nor watered down. I'm not sure what Blue Moon was aiming for with this, but like their Belgian White, this would be a decent choice for a vast majority of beer drinkers. I'm glad I gave this a try."
"Pours with a decent size head. I love the way this beer looks. It looks very warm yellow, honey color. It smells like a macro lager, tastes like a toastier macro lager. Not impressive, worth a try and only buy one if you like blue moon, but not a very good beer."
"Initially, the tan head is full of life, but quickly lies dormant, leaving not much but a memory. Atop the slightly hazy honey-coloured body it offered promised, but is a letdown, much like the nose that lacks character beyond basic wheat and sweet. The flavor profile logically follows, with an active carbonation leading an artificially sweet wheat with a touch of citrus bitterness that melds together in a rather incongruent way. Read into it and it comes off more like pear than berries. The thin and watery body does not help. A bastardization of Blue Moon, not a winter warmer, far from a Belgian's complexity or darkness, nor interesting in a good way. Reeks of marketing capitalizing on a brand name's proven formula. Stick with the original."
"Hmm, at first sniff and taste it seems like a toastier version of Blue Moon. Sure, it's not bad, but there isnt much abbey about this. The mouthfeel isn't bad and there's nice lacing. But it's a little heavy on the spice, nutmeg and cinnamon, I think. I wouldn't call this Belgian or even very good, but kudos to Coors for making a decent beer."
"Since I had not sampled a Coors product in at least 10 years, I wanted to give this one a real honest shot. It poured great and had a nice amber color that reminded me of a darkish Maerzen. The first sip wasn't too bad, either, because I could detect a wisp of malt. It was all down hill from there. There was this synthetic or artificial mouthfeel that didn't make me feel comfortable. The aftertaste was a bit too bitter, too. I need someone to finish off the rest of this six pack for me..."
"It poured well, a nice looking golden amber with a decent head that is suprisingly lacey. The smell wasn't anything special, no hints of any special flavors. Taste was mediocre at best. Not the kind of thing I'd expect from Blue Moon. Nothing special again. Mouthfeel was alright, again, nothing noticable. Drinkablility for this was average. This is an average beer, if you like Blue Moon, get original."
"Pours a darker amber with a moderate cushy head. Smells of spice and malt with a metallic hint. Tastes warm and sharp, more alcohol than spice. Feels moderate with a lingering spicy metallic finish. Wouldn't be bad to drink on a cold day. There isn't much more to say, screw this comment length."
"Pours a medium amber with ruddy brown overtones and an initially fluffy head that dissipates in no time. Dull aromas of sweetness and cooked grains. Some faint doughy spices linger in the background, but the overall effect is shapeless and uninspired. On the palate, sweet, with some gingery citrus notes first off, before off-sweet adjunct flavors take over the mid-palate. The finish sticks to the palate with sour-sweet tenacity. Ugh. There is really nothing to recommend this beer. If you want a Belgian-style beer (I assume that's what they're going for, since the label calls this an ""abbey ale""), there are many other places to go. If you want a full-bodied winter beer, the same applies. Avoid."
"D - Pretty drinkable stuff, I could easily down this sixer and be content. I'd pick it up over the regular Blue Moon any day of the week. Overall not bad, I'd say it's worth picking up a single and giving it a try."
"A hint of sweetness in the flavor. Rather mild, not too much of a Belgiany-yeasty flavor...drinkable and smooth....not incredible but decent nonetheless"
"Poured a clear light copper color with georgeous white head that lasted for a long time. Aroma was almost non-existent, and nothing was really discernible. The taste did not live up to the beautiful appearance. Very bland. Slightly sweet. The mouthfeel was good and the lacing on the glass was excellent. The aroma and taste were severely lacking, but since nothing was really offensive, the drinkability is average."
"Bought a six pack of Full Moon since I have enjoyed Blue Moon products in the past. Anyway i was very disappointed after I had one. Smell was very sugary with little else. Taste was bland with the taste of you guest it sugar! Not recommended by me there are much better winter beers out there then this one."
"D-A decent winter ale for the person who drinks a basic macro as his go to beer. This is just too lightly flavored for my tastes in a winter ale...but it's not a horrible beer by any means..."
"Full Moon delivers as an enjoyable, mild, Belgian-style Winter Warmer. Worth a try."
"Drinkability- Personally I would avoid this beer."
"is so hard to find during the season, this is ok stuff , next...."
"Edit: The beer's taste does improve a little after it warms. Still not great though."
"2008 version update -- MUCH better. Nice head and some decent lacing, good crisp scent, nice hint of cherry and sugar in the taste. Goes down smooth. I really enjoyed it this year."
"This beer looks very interesting but I found it to be subpar"
"Not quite sure why I keep pursuing Coors' Blue Moon brand. The white is average, at best. The pumpkin is lacking and this winter offering falls short also. I keep hoping for something from this brand that just never really materializes."
"Like most selections from the Blue Moon Brewing Co., this is a pretty good beer. A wonderful seasonal variety that's definitely worth a try. The distinct taste of Belgian sugar definitely stands out, and a nice combination of oily-sweetness dominates this brew. Although released in the late fall/early winter, I would enjoy this drink year 'round. It is definitely worth a try if you are a fan of Blue Moon and winter varieties. The candied sweetness lingers on your tongue after one or two beers. Can be enjoyed with just about anything... especially sweets. I really liked this beer..."
"Tried this on a whim as it is not really cool enough yet for a Winter Ale in my area. Appearance was average, looked a lot like a big brewery attempt at an amber. Nice head on first pouring but I didn't get a lot of retention. The aromas were a bit weak, to my mind. I like a more assertive aroma from my beer, light hoppy scent, just the merest hint of spice, malt seemed to come through the strongest. Taste was the same, not very assertive. I agree with some of the other reviews that this is less an attempt at crafting a good winter ale than it is an attempt to garner some of the Winter Ale market share without offending anyone. A little better than most large brew concoctions but no need to worry about cluttering your walls with awards on this one. The fact that the taste is so inoffensive makes it quite drinkable but this will not become my standard ale for the cold weather."
"D - It has a good taste and is smooth I think I could drink this all X-mas morning while opening gifts up."
"Yea, ok. We can do this... Well, the bottle says, ""An abby ale brewed with a hint of dark Belgian candy sugars."" as if they are passing this beer off as a true Abbey. In all actuallity, the beer begins with an aroma that's chocked full of raw cereal grains and with a peculliar acrid, chalky character due to added sugars. The beer holds no depth into anything abbey-like. However the beer does have some underlying malt / barley flavors and aromas, decorated with a dry spiciness and light fruitiness (apples and peaches). Beyond that, the hop character may offset the sweetness, but offers no flavor / aromatic qualities. Is the beer a disaster? Well, no. But it surely falls short of it's timid claims. It's drinkable because the flavors are quite clean. But it's a far cry from true abbey-style beers."
"D Very drinkable. Not a bad candidate for a winter session with a few friends. For the price not bad at all."
"Labeled Full Moon on my bottle. Pours a golden amber,with a nice white head. Very good retention,and lacing. Aroma was of malts,and spices. Nice,but weak. Medium bodied,with carbonation. Taste was of carmel,vanilla,and spice. Very nice,from start to finish. Good session beer this winter!"
"My wife bought this for me today while shopping at Wegmans...man I love my wife.Poured into a standard pint glass a slight hazed bronze color with a tight formed 1/2 finger white head that actually held some decent retention,faint toasted malt aromas a touch of brown sugar-like sweetness as well as a touch of clove.Much better than I thought it would be flavor wise its a bit toasty with some residual caramel sweetness that vanilla that everyone talks about to me is faint it seems a little spiced but not overly so it has a spicy finish but not overdone.Anew recipe for 2007?Iam not flabbergasted by it by any means but you know its not horrible I wouldnt be ashamed to serve this to by beer-liking friends....really Iam serious."
"I went into this not having had a Blue Moon beer in years, and with an open mind. Still, what I find is a step in the right direction, but ultimately a very short journey to a place that is smack dab in the middle of Mediocre-town. If they can manage to bolden those flavors, make some things stand out, and replace the blandness with some character, then this could be a winner. Until they do that, though, it's drinkable only if nothing else better is available. I guess not everybody wants to aim high."
"Labelled ""Full Moon"" on my bottle. Amber beer with a small light tan head, that does not linger. Not much aroma, what there is is sweet malts and maybe some yeast. Taste is mostly malts, sweet, touch of spice especially on the back of the throat and some yeast Ok on the palate, I found the highish carbonation cleaned the sugary taste out fast which is good. Over all not really a bad beer at all. Rather drinkable. the label claims this is ""Abbey Ale brewed with a hint of dark belgian sugar, I think not."
"D: Maybe a bit to sweet to drink all afternoon. But not overpowering."
"Drinks pretty good, but a bit of a weak sister of a winter warmer. Buck this up more with malt & you have a winner"
"On-tap at Kelly Cole's Improper. This is a mild Belgian more than a spicier English winter warmer. Medium bodied with carbonation bubbles prominent in a lighter colour. Malty fruity aroma. Sourish. Not bad for Coors but a below-average beer for sure."
"I'm not sure I am reviewing the right beer. Blue Moon Full Moon is the winter seasonal for Blue Moon. It is a completely new recipe and new beer from last years winter. I guess we have kind of combined the two of them on this website. This year's version is an abbey ale. The appearance is amber and strong with little smell. The taste, however, is strong, dark, and sugary. Very nice on the palate. The mouthfeel is as good as it gets, the perfect thickness and I could drink a lot more of these than I could most Abbey Ales."
"The beer pours a clear reddish Amber with a three fingered creamy off white head that fades leaving a decent covering of lace. Nose has a nice malt sweetness, hints of spices, caramel, fresh and pleasant. Start has an adequate grain presence, the spices sweet and a bit tart, top is light. Finish has a nice spice presence, hops acceptable, quite dry and sweet lingering aftertaste, must say I found this beer quite drinkable, and the best of all the Â“Blue MoonÂ” beers."
"This is essentially a sweetened amber ale. It has the flavor profile of an amber with some of that familiar, sometimes off putting bitterness. The ""hint of Belgian sugar"" the bottle claims is in here tones down or covers up some of the potentially less appealing characteristics. Frankly, I enjoyed the winter warmer that was released directly under the Coors label. It struck me as being a bolder, a bit spicier and a bit more flavorful. This stuff ain't so bad, though when consumed straight from the bottle the flavors seem more concentrated. If you're looking for a stronger presence out of this winter warmer I recommend that course. For something lighter, pour it in a glass and let it warm."
"Drinkability: I wouldn't buy this again, but it looked interesting, and I wanted to see what they could do with what they tout as an Abbey ale. Turns out I probably should've opted for something else. Not too bad, but if you're thinking of a Belgian (which should probably not be domestic, in this case), you may want to stick with something you know and like."
"Aftertaste is slightly cloying and unpleasantly synthetic."
"Looks good, smells good, but ... umm ... well. That's about it. This does not taste spit-it-out bad, and its okay once it warms up a little. It's too sweet and sugary, which may appeal to some people, but not me. This definitely has some potential, but for now, I'd pass unless you don't mind a sweet tasting brew."
"Oh, well. Not one I would buy again."
"Overall, i was hoping for better. There are no flavors in here that i really like. I could see myself only having this one time a night."
"Sigh."
"Poured into a pint glass from a 12oz. bottle. The beer pours a medium copper, forming a 1 inch slightly tan head. The head fades to a 1/4 inch head, leaving medium spots of lace. The aroma is slightly sweet, sugar and spice, along with a hint of sweet malt. The taste consists of a light vanilla flavor, along with light malt, and maybe a hint of spices. The taste reminds me of a not-as-intense version of AB's vanilla cask ale. Not bad, but not as good as the label would lead you to think. Go figure. Medium mouthfeel. Not bad for a holiday beer, but there are still others way better. Overall, worth the $6 for a sixer. Try it."
"i bought this beer from an abc liquor store a couple days ago, winter ale in october? i thought it was a decent brew, has a nice smell of spice and winter, not a bad job from coors honestly. very drinkable, the spice is not overpowering but i believe balanced well with the dark sugar."
"Picked up this earlier this week. I don't know why it's already out (now called Full Moon) in the second week of October. Where's the pumpkin spice?! Very nice copper amber color with a nice thick white head with a tint of copper. Sweet malty aroma. Tastes alot like a darker sweeter version of the original blue moon. Very malty with hints of light hops that give it some bitterness. The aftertaste isn't bad but it is a bit dry. It is pretty good for a winter ale. Like it says, worth a try."
"D: Barely average, but I'll give it a '3' based on a gorgeous look & a good/interesting aroma. Flavor was muddy but fair and mouthfeel is a detractor. Liked this the first couple sips then the novelty wore off; by mid-glass I was looking forward to the finish and even considered dumping some. Somewhat fun, worth a try, then move on..."
"I was somewhat confused about a seasonal beer from Blue Moon. Is it a wheat beer, is it a Winter Ale, is it worth trying? It turned out to be a pleasant surprise. Not much of an aroma to it, but the Caramel kicks in on the first taste. Not in the same league as Sam Adams or Harpoon, but definitely worth a taste."
"D- There is something just not totally right with this beer. Lack of body and odd vanilla flavors just at me first. Lack of real malt density & flavor does this one is when it comes down to it. Take this one back to the chalk board ..."
"Drinkability - for me, a very easy beer to drink. The vanilla flavor doesn't come off as syrupy or cloying to me, keeping this 'beery' enough for session consumption."
"I can say that I'd rather drink this than Icehouse or Coors light (interesting because Coors makes this), but that's about the only good thing I can say about it. Stay away from this one, or just buy one bottle and see if you like it first before buying a whole 6 pack."
"D- Although this beer has some syrupy flavors they are not overly sweet just a little chemical tasting. There isn't much malt flavor behind the caramel notes but the finish is clean so the flavors don't hang on the tongue."
"D: Kind of tasty but way too sweet for me, goes down easy, slightly filling, I definitely would not drink this one again."
"D - I applaud the effort, but I can't stand this. I can see where some people would love it, and if it gets more people to try craft beer, then I'm behind it in theory. But I can't drink it."
"Overall, this is a quite tasty winter warmer. Perhaps a few spices added into the mix could help balance out the sweetness and I found it to be a bit thin bodied. Otherwise It's probably one of the best Coors beers I've had."
"Finish is short, with touch of nutty sweetness but not much else."
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle with a best by date printed on the bottle by the neck. Label describes it as an ""Amber ale with winter spices"". I'd call it Liquid Praline. It poured with a good couple finger head that slowly dissipated. It was a solid amber color and had good carb. The smell was dead-on praline with some vanilla in background. Great smell for a soda but not for a beer. The taste was basically the same as the smell and again great for a cream soda but not a beer. Not sure what they were trying to do here but it didn't work for me. I'm extremely glad that I got this as a single instead of a 6ixer. Highly recommend that you avoid unless you are looking for a cream soda (1.5, NA, ML, N)"
"personally i like my beers to tase like beer not Cream Soda. Then again thats just my opinion. The beer had a nice color to it but i thought i was drinking Mug cream soda and after a couple of sips i wanted to vomit i ended up giving the other 5 beers away. I would only recomended if you like sweet candy tasting beers. but otherwise steer clear"
"I can honestly say this is one of the worst beers I have ever tasted. It was thin and had an artificial taste like I was drinking cold runny maple syrup. Also, the smell seemed to linger long after the beer was gone. It was not a pleasent experience, whicb is a suprise, because I am fond of the regular Blue Moon. This however was not a good effort. I would avoid this beer."
"Overall, I was impressed with this beer. It's not very balanced, but still delicious. This is the best beer I've drank from Coors, ever."
"Drinkability: Didn't finish a bottle. Too watery."
"Drinkability: Going through one was tough. Now I've got 5 left. What to do with those... I hate when this happens."
"Drinkability: A halfway approach to a winter beer, artificial and thin tasting."
"Pours a clear mahogany-amber with an off-white, creamy three finger head. Decent retention but minimal lacing. Vanilla bean and ginger in the nose with strong caramel and toffee notes; some background crystal malt aroma. Pale malt and crystal sweetness upfront, followed by mild cinnamon and ginger flavors, then an assertive caramel taste. The semi-dry aftertaste shows some mellow english hops, mabye Fuggle or East Kent goldings. The caramel taste is really pronounced and kind of drowns out everything else, but the flavor remains mostly balanced. Medium in body with a medium/high carbonation; it's smooth and has some texture, but could have been a little less crisp to preserve the maltiness. Finishes mellow and drinkable with lingering caramel and soft english hop character; last few swigs present a ghost-like hefe-yeast notes. Coors has produced another affordable craft beer with respectable complexity AND a high drinkability."
"Overall: this is a solid brew, surprisingly so since it carries the Blue Moon label, but I suppose that underscores the thought that you shouldnÂ’t prejudge. Flavor is not incredible, but overall, this is a very decent beer. Worth a try."
"An enjoyable winter brew with some unique spices, but the mouthfeel is a tad thin overall."
"Come to think about it, this is a lighter version of the style just like regular Blue Moon White is a light tasting version of a wit. Not bad for a change of pace type beer. Did someone say crossover beer?"
"This was a very enjoyable beer to say the least. My buddy picked up a few and immediatly, because he does not like many beers, I thought it was going to be either exceptional or well below par. I was however pleasantly surprised with the taste of familiar winter flavors in it that I did not expect and a smell that that was equally pleasant. I would suggest this a beer to appreciate and enjoy but I couldn't have more than two at a time because I felt as though I was being selfish or spoiling myself. Bottom line though: if given the chance definatly partake in this one."
"Served in a pint glass, the Blue Moon Winter Ale pours a copper color with a good sized off-white head. Nice lacing too. It smells sweet, like caramel, brown sugar, vanilla and fresh baked cookies (yeah, I know that sounds weird). It has a nutty taste, along with caramel and vanilla. It does have a slight bitter/sour aftertaste (which gets less bitter/sour as the beer warms), but overall the taste is mostly sweet. The mouthfeel is light and a little bit creamy. The drinkability is good too, but I don't know if I could drink more than 2 or 3 at a time. This is a pleasant surprise, I really wasn't expecting too much from this but I think this is a decent beer."
"taste is the best out of all of the blue moon family i have ever had. extremely lavish with caramel flavor amongst vanilla and almost a nutty taste. finishing up each sip leaves me anticipating the next."
"drinkability - I probably wouldn't want to drink more than 3"
"Overall impression: Not the most exciting seasonal out there, but not too bad either. A bit too sweet for me to drink many."
"I tried this beer on tap at Sky in Sudbury, MA. I was surprised at how much I liked this beer. The head was creamy and the mouthfeel was full. It has a gingerbread aftertaste that I liked. It reminded me of Anderson Valley's Winter Solstice of several years ago. I hope this is available in 1/6ths!"
