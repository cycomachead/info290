3.71,0.5,4,3.5,3.75,3.75,3.75,"Pours a medium brown producing 2+ finger of fluffy, tan, moderately lasting head that leaves a nice coating of rings & webby lace. Aroma is dark bready malt, light roast, molasses, caramel & sour dark fruits. Taste is roast, dark malt, some Belgian yeast with subdued fruity esters, fig & prune, brown sugar & thin hints of chocolate. Slight hop presence detectable in the finish & aftertaste. Some burned coffee notes in the aftertaste also. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium-high carbonation, wet, juicy, little slick & very prickly. Pleasant enough dubbel but a little lacking in complexity & roundness found in the better examples.","mothmanscott","Saturday at 06:04 PM"

Full aroma with a variety of elements with remind me most of roasted dates or prunes with a nice compliment of barley maltishness. A full taste follows but doesn't quite live up to the aroma, but still a pretty tasty half hour enjoying this import.

3.78,2.4,4,3.5,4,4,3.5,"750 ml bottle into chalice, no bottle dating. Pours slightly hazy deep ruby red color with a 1 finger fairly dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Slight spotty lacing clings on the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation retaining the lace. Aromas of big raisin, fig, pear, apple, grape, molasses, toffee, candi sugar, toast, light chocolate, herbal, floral, clove, light pepper, and yeast earthiness. Nice aromas with good balance and complexity of malt/candi sugar and fruit/spicy yeast notes with good strength. A bit musty. Taste of raisin, fig, plum, pear, apple, molasses, caramel, toffee, candi sugar, toast, light chocolate, clove, pepper, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Lingering notes of raisin, fig, plum, pear, apple, caramel, molasses, toffee, candi sugar, toast, light chocolate, herbal, pepper, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a while. Very nice balance, robustness, and complexity of malt/candi sugar and fruity/spicy yeast flavors; with a very nice malt/yeast flavor balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a moderately slick, smooth, and lightly prickly mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with zero warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very good dubbel style. Good balance, robustness, and complexity of malt sweetness and fruity/spicy yeast flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the ABV. A nicely enjoyable offering.","superspak","Jan 20, 2014"

The head dissipates slowly on this dubbel, leaving around plenty of head during consumption. Plenty of lacing is left on the side of the glass during consumption. The beer smells of bready malts and yeast, dark candi sugar, raisins, prunes, apples, and other fruits. The aroma of this dubbel is actually quite fruity. The taste follows the nose here. There is a bready malt backbone that gives way to the fruity flavors detected in the aroma. There's a bit of citrus tang in this beer as well. The alcohol is well hidden. The malt profile of this beer is very solid. The body is medium with moderate carbonation. The body is actually ligher than most dubbels, which makes this higher ABV beer highly drinkable.

I've poured entire 22 oz chugs into this snifter and this dubbel surged almost all the way to the top. Traditional hops and Belgian pils malt and caramel malt and smoked malt come through much more than the yeast, which I find to be the dominant flavor in many dubbels. Still quite a good funkiness from the yeast though. It's surprisingly light and spritzy on the tongue. It's also quite sweet, I would say a little under-balanced on the hop side, but still a very enjoyable beer. Does it compete with any of the Trappist dubbels?

The taste emphasizes the fruits up front, primarily green apples, pears, plums; a sweeter backbone comes in later, consisting of caramel, rye bread, figs, brown sugar, and cinnamon.

Bornem is a smooth drink, you barely notice the 8% abv and rather tasty. The combination of the slight plum taste and barely make it very palatable. It may not be the most exciting flavor or Dubbel, but the easy drinkability makes this a great beer to sit back and relax with, almost a higher abv session beer.","FernMaster","Aug 22, 2009"

There was a bar in college that had these for a dollar each (on tuesdays I think), it was my first real intro to Belgian beer, and for that reason, still holds a place in my heart.

Almost a black hue, but more dark brown with rubish tints and good carbonation. The smell is very citrusy/fruity, like oranges or pears or grapes. Not overbearing like a weiss/wheat, but it overpowers the malt. Hints of bread are there too. The taste went back and forth, as there are malts that hit the tongue first but then a sour tartness (sour apples, white grapes, I don't know) takes over. Some of this dryness stems from a 8% ABV that I did not think was hidden very well and the spices they threw in, but it does go down fairly smooth for a highly malted medium-bodied, slight yeasty abbey ale.

Nice sized head that left a fair amount of lacing along the sides of the glass. The aromas are nice, raisin/prune, slight chocolate and caramel, tart cherries that give it a slight sour smell. The taste is quite smooth and follows in line with the aromas but the sour aspect of it seems to come out a little more. To be truthful, I was surprised that this is a double as it did not seem to come across that way. Muted spice and alcohol feel with a noticeable tart/sourness.

It's actually over-carbonated which makes it hard to drink. Has a strange aroma that's hard to place. Roasted malts with a metallic aroma maybe. Extremely well-crafted to yield this much head. Aroma kind of smells like tomatoes. If I can get the head to reduce I can actually taste this and finish this review. Extreme carbonation reduces the quality of the mouthfeel and finish. It leaves it real fizzy like seltzer water. It expands in you mouth like foam. That will reduce the drinkability for me also. Very dry bitter finish with hints of roasted malts and grains.

The first sip reveals an immediate sweetness. Sugary chocolate and yeasty malt, drizzled with apple butter. confectioners sugar and plum juice.

3.48,-5.7,4,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"Somewhat clear, brown is the base hue but there are significant influences of gold and amber. There is pretty good color depth but it still seems thin to me, Id like to see it a little darker. The head was beige in color, at the apex the foam was two fingers in height and then it quickly faded to a half finger, foamy cap. This cap had good staying power, it lasted the entire consumption. The subsequent lacing was spotty and it clung poorly. The nose is pleasant in aroma but weak in presentation. Ripe fruits are the strongest aroma, dates, figs, and plums. Spicy brown sugar notes follow, they seem to springboard from the malt base. There is a slight band-aid aroma, some cloves too, with a generic medicinal aroma. Raisins. Cola. Caramel. Overall the potency is moderate but the strongest aromas easily overpower the subtleties. A casual sniff only renders the dark fruit. Simplistic. It is inviting but I have some reluctance. The palate is tasty but unimpressive. The bouquet was simplistic but not as unsophisticated as the taste. There isnt much complexity here, sure I like what I taste but there is nothing to sink my teeth into. There is no body here, where is the malt backbone? I get plenty of dark fruits (rains, dates, figs) and they taste lovely. They really do. Sprinkles of caramel and there is even a dusting of band-aids and clove. The alcohol is very perceptible. Hops do offer some bitterness and a biting twang with an herbal note. As you see this beer has flavor but the proportions dont seem right. More malt is needed. Badly. The finish is a bit too clean; more yeast residue is needed. Ordinary. Its not flawed, just boring. Medium-light in body, the carbonation is big and lively, the mouthfeel is too thin and too effervescent. I thought this beer was merely okay. This is a very average Dubbel. I cant foresee another purchase of this beer. Maybe this would be a good introduction to Belgian beers for the timid. Purchased as part of a sampler-pack in Ames, IA.","bditty187","Feb 02, 2005"

Tastes of alcohol and a little bit of hops and spice. Mouthfeel is a little thick and slippery, but very satisfying. A good all-around beer.","TastyTaste","Nov 18, 2003"

3.95,7,4,4,4,3.5,4,"Dark burnt sienna color, mult-sizes to the bubbles of the head and a good 1/2 inch of bottle conditioned suds. A lot of apple and peach to the aroma, fruity. In contrast the malt flavor seems to feature a husky nut-like characteristic, dominant and lasting throughout the taste. Yeast and plum components are in here as well, however this beer seems ""tight"" for a Dubbel, a style that can show combinations of chocolate and multiple fruit profiles. Not a killer in complexity, it seems like the bigger Gulden Draake and Piraat have the most challenging interest in the Van Steenberge line -- but they do seem to produce a lot more beers than I've had opportunity to get my hands on.","ADR","Nov 16, 2003"

3.71,0.5,4,3,4,3.5,4,"Deep garnet, very dark with huge long lasting head. Head lasts forever, but leaves little lace. Sweet, fruity aroma with a slightly off note to it. Sweet and malty with cherry and raisin flavors. Slightly tart and clean in the finish. Moderate body with good carbonation. Good, but not great","Sixpack595","Nov 12, 2003"
4.32,17.1,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"This was one of the cleanest, freshest tasting dubbels I've ever had. Differed quite a bit from the other Belgian Dubbels due to it's lack of your typical horse blanket, earthiness yeast flavors. I enjoy those complexities and was surprised that the Bornem was so different. The beer poured a reddish brown with a thick but quickly dissipating head, and exploded with fruit in the nose. My first impression was of sour cherries and grapes. This ale reminded me of a Flemish Sour Ale, more than a dubbel. Refermented in the bottle this may be a much different beer, I've always contended that Belgians on tap tend to be less complex and cleaner than their bottled cousins.","QXSTER1","Nov 01, 2003"
3.67,-0.5,3,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"The head is markedly better than my first review. It is full, came up easy, and showed awesome retention. The carbonation was a little better as well, so Im changing some scores around that will move it up from an overall 3.6 to 3.9.","RoyalT","Oct 16, 2003"
3.58,-3,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Pours deep brown with ruby highlights. It forms a thick chunky head, with good lacing. It has an herbal, fruity aroma like that of dates and raisins. The flavor is medicinal with a light taste of dark fruits. It is light bodied for its strength but easy drinking. Not too bad, but I would not search this one out again.","BeerBuilder","Oct 15, 2003"
3.94,6.8,3,4,4,4,4,"Poured a muddy brown color with a huge head that quickly receeded leaving about 1/4"" top.Aroma of malt with some yeast notes.Somewhat bready and earthy.A slight caramel taste in the flavor-as well as a malty sweetness.Slight hop bitterness.Nice full mouthfeel-the 8% alchohol comes thru just a bit.Overall a nice double.Worth a try.","lackenhauser","Oct 09, 2003"
3.85,4.3,4,4,4,3.5,3.5,"The Dubbel poured a dirty cloudy brown color with a slight head. As the head subsided, a very strong carbonation became present as bubbles were exploding on the liquid surface. Not sure if this was normal. The aroma was sweet and yeasty, with some floral tones. The flavor was like other Belgian Dubbles, with a sweet maltiness and slight yeast flavors. The difference was this was much crisper and more bubbly in the mouth. The alcohol level of 8% was not as noticeable. The higher carbonation levels dropped the mouthfeel and drinkability categories to a notch below good.","Gavage","Aug 18, 2003"
3.45,-6.5,4,4,3.5,3.5,2.5,"Pours a dark amber with a full tan head and a little lacing on the glass. The aroma is slightly wheaty, but with some fruits underneath and also some malts are present. It has a medium fullness for body. The taste is a little sweet and there are just enough spices to make it interesting. Taste has a caramel flavor to it and the carbonation stays present in the taste as well. Not a bad beer, but flavor didn't meet my expectations.","clvand0","Aug 18, 2003"

3.8,3,4,4,3.5,4,4,"Pours out the raisiny brown one would expect from a dubbel. Had an enormous head (Must have poured too quickly) that I had to wait quite a while. Smell was sweet bread-like, a malty overtone dominant. Taste was suprisingly uncomplex, something was a bit missing. Overall, a well done beer but the lack of pop in the taste left me wanting for more...","euskera","Aug 09, 2003"
3.48,-5.7,4,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"Medium brown color, medium head. Aroma is malty, sweet and somewhat nutty. Malts are sweet, its hoppy and slightly spicy. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is very smooth. Aftertaste is slightly bitter. No alcohol bite, despite 8% alcohol. Nice drinkable beer.","beerguy101","Aug 01, 2003"
3.13,-15.2,3.5,3,3,3,3.5,"It has a carbonated mouthfeel with a strong grassy wheat feel. It's drinkability is okay. Very well made it just did not stand out for me. I am sure people who seek out this ale will rate it much higher than I did.","Rumrunner","Jul 31, 2003"
2.9,-21.4,3,3,3,3,2.5,"Originally sampled on 13 November 2003. I am writing this review from my notes. This pours a brown color with a good sized head. The flavor has a nice roastiness to it, but it was nothing spectacular. There are better abbey ales to be found, this was just OK","jcalabre","Jul 11, 2003"
4.8,30.1,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,5,"Poured a deep dark crimson color with a nice creamy head. The smell was subtle yet powerful, with scents of carmel malt, spices, and alcohol. The taste was smooth and delightful. Initial taste was a nectar-like sweetness with a hint of orange and spice. Alcohol and fruit flavors became apparent in the middle, and the finish was silky smooth perfection that left no harsh aftertaste. A dangerous beer because I could easily drink several of these without realizing it. Another great one from the Van Steenberge family.","jaz","Jun 13, 2003"
2.94,-20.3,4,2.5,3,3,3,"Mine says 11%ABV. Nice creamy lasting head. Aroma is quite yeasty. I got a bit of yeast, some apple juice and some Ribena in the flavour. Relatively dry in the end, texture is quite soft and a bit thin for such a strong beer. A bit average i reckon. Not too bad.","rastaman","Jun 02, 2003"
4.42,19.8,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"A hazy chocolate-brown body gently streams with tiny bubbles beneath a full and foamy light-tan head. The retention is excellent and it very slowly drops to a creamy collar and shallow surface covering. With each sip you take it leaves sheets of lace. Unfortunately, the lacing seems to be unable to stick to the glass and slowly slides back into the beer. The bouquet displays a combination of malt and fruit that includes cocoa and caramel (similar to Ovaltine) splashed by gentle, mildly-tart raisins and plums. The body is thin and crisp on the tongue with a very fine and effervescent carbonation that warms in the mouth to become nicely creamy. The flavor initially displays the cocoa and caramel found in the nose, but quickly thins with a lightly acidic and fruity (cherry-like) character. The more yeast that's allowed to enter the glass, the sharper the fruitiness is. As it warms, however, it softens to become more chocolatey and raisin-like. A note of alcohol becomes apparent at the swallow, and it finishes dry with a lingering note of soft, fruity chocolate (similar to chocolate covered raisins). Quite nice! Rich and fairly complex with a good deal of malt and fruit, yet light in the mouth. Very drinkable, and well worth trying.","NeroFiddled","May 29, 2003"
3.3,-10.6,4,4,3,3,3,"As a side note, it gets my vote for scariest bottle. That grotesque Monk is absolutely hideous. WTF is with those eyes? Make it go away...","cokes","May 03, 2003"
4.46,20.9,3.5,5,4.5,4.5,4,"Once again I fell in love with this beer on draft this past summer while quaffing beers at the Yardhouse in Costa Mesa, CA. This is like a friend revisited, this beer pours ruby musky brown slightly hazed with a cream tan head with weak head retention. This is one malty treat wrapped in raisins and a load of perfectly ripened succulent fruit (mainly pears and apples). Flavor profile brings on a vinous grape tone with hints of mildly alcoholic plum brandy. Wonderful underlying richness of fruit tones. God, I love this beer is topped with a candied apple finish. What a smooth mouthfeel the creaminess that this beer produces to the palate is dream like. Wow, high abv but this beer is amazingly balanced in every way, I know I could put more than one down.","WVbeergeek","May 02, 2003"

3.65,-1.1,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Be careful when pourning, lots of tight, light brown foam along with a hazy brick brown color. The smell of toffee/caramel and malt/hop's fill the nose. The taste was of a toasty toffe with layer of malt and hops. A decent beer without being heavy. Well-balanced and nicely put together! But, not on the top of my list!","BeerManDan","Apr 03, 2003"
3.71,0.5,5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Notes: A bit brash on the palate for my liking, enjoyable but not something I’d hunt for again. It did very well up against the sharp cheddar I paired it with.","Jason","Apr 01, 2003"

3.33,-9.8,3.5,3,3.5,3,3.5,"Color's a dark burgundy, with ruby highlights, and huge, billowy, creamy tan head stands above. My superlatives end there, as I encounter one of the simplest ""abbey dubbels"" I've yet encountered. Aroma: small suggestions of nuts, cream, dark fruits(cherry, grapes), little hints of toffee, and there may be elargely to a fault, for there's precious little of the deep complexity we find in favorite dubbels, Ommegang, or Maredsous. Malt is king, here, hops are hidden, blasts of carbonation hit the palate now and again. Finish is, ""okay", there's a minor grainy grit in the texture, but, alas, this is a rather ordinary brew for the style","feloniousmonk","Mar 05, 2003"
4,8.4,4,4,4,4,4,"Second in my six pack sampler, was this offering. Agood reddish color, with a good head. A fruity taste, with a good dose of malt.

3.92,6.2,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"Appearance of murky iced tea or apple squeezins. No real head to speak of. Almost has a coca-cola type of carbonation. Big fizzy bubbles that fade fast. Sweet malty aroma, fruity, with a definite caramel bite. Almost smells like chocolate covered raisins. Forget almost, that's exactly what it smells like. A box of raisinettes soaked in alcohol. Tastes of caramel and raisins too. Tart finish. This beer is a nice winter warmer. Just the right body, but a little overcarbonated IMO. Pretty drinkable though.","cretemixer","Feb 05, 2003"
4.08,10.6,4.5,4,4,4.5,4,"This beer poured a nice reddish amber color and formed an light tan bubbly head that left circular lace as it subsided. A medium amount of carbonation was present. An aroma of malt, caramel and cherries. A flavor of malt, caramel and raisins. A touch of the alcohol was present in the finish. A rather interesting flavor for a dubbel.","Wildman","Jan 30, 2003"
4.15,12.5,4.5,4.5,4,4,4,"Double Bornem has a very fruity flavor (the cherries). Finishes slightly dry with a just a touch of spice and warming alcohol at the end. This is a killer brew. I'm getting more soon.","IrishRedRock","Jan 24, 2003"
3.92,6.2,4,4.5,3.5,4,4,"Sporting a nose of papaya, pound cake and sour cherries, Bornem pours a well-charged deep amber. Layered sweet malt and tinny hop fight for taste bud supremacy, but are soon overwhelmed by a not so pleasant tang-filled finish riding a wave of alcohol that throws a wrench in the works. Not bad, sturdy and simple.","inebrius","Dec 29, 2002"
4.05,9.8,4,4,4,4.5,4,"On tap at the Yard House in Long Beach CA. It's darker than I remembered it being out of the bottle: brown with a hint of orange. The smell of fruit became more pronounced as it warmed a bit. An assortment of fruit flavors swims around nicely, with notes of plum and cherry. It's definitely a sweet one that rounds out an evening nicely.","mickeymac","Dec 22, 2002"
3.91,6,4.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Pours a dark reddish colour topped by a very impressive thick and creamy head. The colour of the head is light brown which adds to the overall appearance of this dubbel. The aroma is sweet and malty. Good carbonation with strong taste and mouthfeel.","ipogios","Dec 04, 2002"
4.72,27.9,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,5,"This is a beautiful dubbel. Not as ragingly spicy as Duinen. Not as saturated with maple syrup notes as Ommegang. Dryer than those, it melts in your mouth. Perfectly balanced and a joy to drink.","putnam","Nov 04, 2002"
