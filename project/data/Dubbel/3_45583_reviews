"Poured from a brown 22 oz. bottle. Has a dark bronze color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of molasses, malts, mild spice. Taste is fruits, yeast, malts, a touch of spice. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a good quality beer."
""
""
"Light, syrupy with slight bitterness."
""
"Burnt amber, laced fine off white foam. Boozy heat and candi sugar, peanut shell, burly malt. Heavy sweetness upfront gives way to oat"
""
"Well Balanced nutty flavor great finish"
""
""
""
"This was a great ale!"
""
""
""
""
"Smooth, rich, with a very light effervescence. Just the slightest bit of drying but a whole lot of warming. The flavor and body are a perfect primer for the Thanksgiving feast in two weeks. Wish I had another to complement that meal. The best beer from Abita I've ever had, by a good stretch."
""
"Not good, tasted exactly like fresh sweet feed that I put out for deer."

"O - this is best non-Belgian ""Belgian style"" ale I can recall.  Most of the imitation Belgian fail to capture all the elements but this one checks all the boxes. 4.25"

"Ha! I was pleasantly surprised by this pint. Superior ingredients to other Abbey Ales. Fruity in flavor along with caramel and toffee flavors. Calming in its effect. Definitely not overwhelming. A beautiful brownish red in color, the marksmanship of a true Abbey. Delicious at its tip and smooth all the way down in its consumption."

""
""
""

"The creaminess of the body gives it a medium full feel. The fine carbonation works very well with the rich malts which are balanced by the yeast and alcohol flavors."

"Have to give it a bit of credit given the price compared to other brews that claim to be abbey type ales. I guess a nice try but I wouldn't introduce a newcomer to the style with this brew."
""
""
"The taste brings out a little more of the toasted malts but it is the almost juice-like red grape that overpowers everything else in the character. Some tart bitterness on the tail end. Not on my ""buy again"" list."

"Ah okay so lets sit down to some Abbey Ale by the Abita brewing company... I had high hopes for this brew as I'm a huge fan anything that says ""ale"" and I mean from all ends of the spectrum from Indian pale ales to smoked darker ales.. I love ale! So without further-a-do lets crack this baby open. On pouring the brew it had a deep reddish orange appearance and a thick foamy creamy brown head lasting even into my first sip. I drank this brew at room temperature to give everyone my full experience info and honestly Im glad I kept it that way. The taste had apples, yeast, ginger, cinnamon and I want to say vanilla? It's a very interesting brew and it's actually growing on me the more sips I take. I feel that this brew was very pleasant and at the price a good deal. It's not among the world class beers by all means but I would say more of a nice autumn time brew. It has a nice fizz in the mouth that lingers after letting it down the hatch. Overall if you're considering this brew my fellow new advocates, go ahead and grab a bottle, you'll be glad you did! Thanks for reading my review and as always beer on my friends."

"O- Pretty solid beer. A bit on the sweet side, but this will not stop me from drinking it again"
""

"Not a true abbey ale in my opinion but still an alright beer in general."

"Overall: I don't have a ton of experience with Dubbels but I liked this one. One of the better beers I've had from Abita."

"O - Not a big fan of Abita but this is an excellent and very accessible representation of a Belgian dubbel."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This was INTENSE. I was very surprised by the smell and then further surprised by the shock of yeasty flavour when I took my first sip. This is an interesting foray into Belgian-style beer and one of the harshest on the yeast front I've ever had, especially for a dubbel. That was enjoyable to an extent, but definitely a bit much. It was a tad sour from all the yeast, but the malts tasted delicious and the alcohol kick was very discernible on the finish, which I enjoyed. So, all in all, it was interesting and enjoyable, but not really a top-notch dubbel."
""
""
""
"O: Not disgusting but I am disappointed and won't seek this out again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: interesting take on a Dubbel from our Cajun friends, has a very noursing quality almost like the ""liquid bread"" mentioned on the bottle, good complexity of flavors present, worth trying if you are an Abita fan or are interested in domestic Dubbels"
""
""
""
""
"This pours a clear, medium brown color with a mild, malty scent. The taste is sweet, malty, and toasty mixed with hints of fruits. It finishes clean and refreshing. Quite a well made Abbey Ale from the Deep South. This is a must try if you can find it in your area!"
"Pours a honey brown with a foamy tan head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Tiny dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, brown sugar, spices, and a slight fruit aroma. Taste is much the same with a toasted malt flavor on the finish. There is a medium amount of spice bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer but nothing all that exciting for an American take on the style."
"Overall, I found this to be quite a nice beer, and I am usually hit or miss on Abita brews. For $4.99 , this is a pretty good bargain and a very enjoyable beer. Very drinkable in a holiday / Christmas environment."

"O - Good looking beer, smell seemed a little disappointing. I expected a little more dark fruit, maybe some esters. Huge flavor but lacking a solid red fruit quality. Excellent feel, from sweet to dry and with an enjoyable amount of alcohol."

"For 5 bucks for a 22oz bottle I have no complaints about this beer. Have i had better abbey beers? Why of course , this one is special in its own way though. I love new belgium abbey , and this one doesnt compare in the same reasons I like it , it has its own special space in my life though. Do not purchase it and think that you are getting a high end superior beer , but if you want to bring your friends along who think bud light and miller lite are the only beer made this might be the one to introduce them to in my opinion , I could drink this while grilling burgers and brats and just enjoy the crap out of life"

"O: Abita Abbey Ale is enjoyable if not challenging. I think Abita did justice to the dubbel style, and it's cool that they donate profits to a local abbey. In sum, I think some extra work with the recipe could tweak this into an amazing beer."

"Very nice blend, and sounds like a worthy cause to boot."
""
"O: I'm really quite impressed. Abita got it right! This is one of my new favorites from the brewery. Will definitely drink again."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is a step in the right direction for Abita, but some tweaking is required to bring this ale up to snuff. The nose is very one-dimensional and the body feels a bit thinner than it should. While this ale may taste like a dubbel, it doesn't particularly smell or feel like one. A worthy effort that has produced mediocre results..."

"Overall â€“ Other than the mouthfeel, the beer really has very nice characteristics. It has a nice sweeter fruit profile mixed with a nice malty backbone. A fairly good sweeter dubbel."
""
""
"Crisp and prickly up front with toasted notes, yeasty sweetness, spicy hops, clove, leaf texture. Very smooth hops bitterness washes away nicely with a friendly yeast flavor that lingers. Hangs around like a tasty wine, only better. Grows creamy as it warms. Depth & character shines through this one."
"O- Pretty off-balance in general, but it's drinkable and there should be something to be said for that...right?"
""
""
""
""
"Poured into a brandy snifter. Pours deep copper with an off-white two finger head. The smell is of sugar, fig, and malt. I pick up malty sweetness in the taste as well as cinnamon and fig. It has a dry finish and this is not much bitterness, but the hops are definitely present. The bread flavor also comes out in this beer. The taste is complex and well-balanced. The alcohol doesn't come forward in the flavor at all. Plenty of lacing is left on the glass. The body is on the higher end of medium and the carbonation is moderate, making this a very drinkable dubbel. I have to tip my hat to Abita for creating a solid and very drinkable dubbel. Overall, this is an excellent beer."

"Out of a bomber bottle this beer was a clear, copper color with two fingers of khaki colored head. The aroma was a very inviting bouquet of vanilla, Belgian yeast, caramel malt, nuts and hints of bread. The flavors were similar with clear notes of yeast bread and caramel sweetness along with more subdued flavors of figs, pepper, plum, nuts and some spicy hops on the finish. Complex but drinkable and punchy without tasting boozy; balanced, in short. The mouthfeel was smooth, the body medium/full and the carbonation medium/light. It was notably sweet for the style but I have a sweet tooth so this appeal to me. Enjoyable and worth your money."
"Sampled from a pint glass"
""
"O: So I actually liked this beer. I might not recommend it, but I certainly don't mind finishing the whole 22 ounce bottle. Good effort, average result."
""
"Overall I wish this beer tasted as good as it smells but its pretty good for a 5 dollar bomber. Not bad."

"spent $5 for this badboy at bevmo. honestly, one of the best american belgian styles i have tried"

"Overall- As a student of St. Joseph's Seminary, this beer is a source of income for all us all. 25 cents of every bottle goes to monks here at the Abbey in St. Benedict, LA. It's a very drinkable beer that Benedictine Monks of the Catholic Church have learned to perfect worldwide. It is meets all expectations of the art of brewing beer at monasteries. Again, it may not be as great as some of the Trappist Monastery Ales of Europe but it comes close at a better price. Vivat Christus Rex!"
"Overall: It's just an ok dubble"

"My first beer from Bayou country, and well, they've done justice to the Belgian tradition, is all I can say. The sweetness could sure use some further counterbalance, but, for the time being, I sure ain't fixin' to complain..."
"Picked up a bottle of this with a little bit of excitement and curiosity. The beer poured out as a light brownish color with a foamy white head on top. The smell of the beer gives off some light floral aromas, Belgian yeast, and some grains in there too. The taste is soft and tasted pretty close to a traditional Abbey Ale. The mouthfeel was soft and smooth. Overall it was a pretty decent brew. I wouldn't need to have it again but I'm glad I tried it."
"O - very enjoyable; seems to be straddling the dubbel/tripel line as there is a mid-palate lift and estery-ness that says tripel; really good effort and one I will return to"
"Alrighty, the app is as follows... A deep reddish brown, clear chestnut color, with a ton of visible carbonation, and a 2 finger head that lays to a tightly bubbled ring around the top. Big sugary malt on the nose, with a sour fruit scent that gives it a salty olive kinda smell, sugary raisins found all over this beer. The taste is all over the place, from sweet malt, to biscuity malts, to wild cherries, to dark fruits, back to sweet malts. Finishes very well but everything in the middle combines to a big sour climax then back to a sweet finish. Medium on the feel, velvety, sour, high carbonation yet smooth . Overall this is ok, i couldnt shake the olive taste though. Nice for the price as it was only 3 bucks, how can you beat that...?"
"A medium bodied beer with good carbonated bite for the style. Really drinkable and satisfying."
"Drinkability: Very good. As a fan of Belgian Dubbels and BSPA's, I like this one a lot. Could easily session with it, and the big bottle was gone quick. I would buy this again when I'm in the mood for the style, and the price was good (under $8)."
"Pretty average Belgian dubbel."
"Overall I am not a big fan of Abita beers but I like this one and I enjoy this one often. Worthy of a try."
"T/m/o- Carmel covered dates raisens drenched in a fine dark rum, with a blanket of warming booziness. More of the same from the smell is in the flavor. Alcohol is blended well very deceiving at 8%. Mouthful is a bit chewy and drinkablity is on the low end for me. Such a sweet style to begin with one bomber is good enough for me. Good beer, not great but worth trying."
"Very nice beer; would be ideal with cigars."
"Overall a very good version of the style. Alcohol well hidden and very tasty. Nicely balanced."
"O - Overall, a very nicely made Dubbel. At 8%ABV not too boozy. Tasty pleasant drink"
" This is a rather excellent American brwed Belgian style. I really appreciate this one because this was the very first style of beer I ever brwed."
"overall this is a good beer and it's worth checking out if you are attracted to the bottle art and description."
"This beer gets better as it warms. I was not a fan at all after the first sip. As it warmed up so did I... a little. At 8 % abv, it hides the alcohol taste very well. Not bad as a post dinner/desert sipper. Like I said, a bit harsh right out of the fridge though"
"Y- Extremely sweet smell. As expected of a sweet smelling beer it starts off malty. Then the hops kick in and the bitterness offsets the malt in a strong way. It's not very distinct in any special way. Overall I'd give it a B-."
"Drinkability - As this beer warms, the alcohol vanishes and it becomes very easy to drink. It is a bit sweet and rich, so I might not make a night of it. It's still very good and worth a try if available. The ease of drinkability and high ABV make for a dangerous combination at first, but as I go along I started to sip."
"D: Refreshing. The alcohol is so well hidden that it's a dangerous drinker. One bomber left me pretty much buzzed."
"This ale is a slightly hazy deep amber colors with a stick off-white head. The aroma is moderately malty -- sweet, raisins, prunes with a noticeable spicy, clove character from the yeast. The flavor closely follows the nose, moderate bittersweet malts with peppery, spicy yeast character. The body is medium-full, silky mouthfeel, and nice lingering malty/yeasty flavors. Overall a tasty, well-made brew. Worth picking up a bomber."
"Poured into a pint glass this brew has a ruby red color with a medium 1 finger white head. The aroma is extremely sweet with hints of apricot and plum. The taste has a nice malty caramel flavor along with some sugary sweetness. The finish brings some of the dried fruit taste. This was a medium body brew and had a nice malt presence. One of the better Abita I had when in NOLA. Glad I brought back to share."
"D - Another tasty offering from a brewery that hasn't let me down so far. It's not the top example of the style but certainly worth a try."
" ~ This is an easily consumed brew. It's a nice drinker and I would recommend it to others."
"D- Solid dubble, nothing outstanding but a good brew none-the-less"
"D: Very drinkable. All in all, very good balance in all aspects. Disguises the ABV well too."
"D - This is a damn good beer. Very drinkable. I wonder how something like this would age. Well worth the price. I would buy this again for sure."
"M/D: Hits all the Dubbel notes well. The sweetness lingers for a long time, but never gets too syrupy or cloying. Best Abita beer I've had so far."
"Bottle was large; 1 pint 6 ounces, I recommend drinking with a friend or two, it's kind of much alone if this is not your favorite style...Worthy beer."
"D - Would recommend giving a try. Better than most of the other Abita offerings. I appreciate and like that Abita is trying a new and interesting style. Not as ""boozy"" as some other Belgian beers in the same arena. Besides, the price is right at $4.99 IMHO."
"D - Above average in my book but scores a exta 1/2 point on the Drinkability Scale due to the $.25 donation Abita makes with every bottle sold."
"Crisp but lush with a fine bubble structure. Almost fluffy on the palate with some dry warmth. Lingering booze and a slight acidic twang. Very enjoyable with a moderate level of complexity. Certainly an above average Dubbel."
"D. Very drinkable and a nice go at a Dubbel! Very affordable but the 8% is a bit of a holdback !"
"D: Drinkability is good for a Dubbel. I'm not going to go so far as to say this trumps a St. Bernardus, Chimay, or Ommegang, but it can hold its own and sufficiently puts the Belgians on notice. The folks at Abita have done an excellent job taking the Dubbel style and infusing it with just enough American craft styles to stand out, but remain an homage to the originals."
"Overall a good beer, I would drink at again, but probably wouldn't become one of my regulars."
"D-would have again, but not my first choice for an abbey style. Was ready to try something else after I finished the tall bottle."
"Excellent winter bear."
"Drinkability - One and I'm done. Not bad, but not ""good"" if you know what I mean. As always glad I was able to try it."
"D: Despite a smell I don't really 'get', Abita presents an Abbey/Dubbel that's plenty drinkable. Heck, I wouldn't be a repeat buyer if there wasn't something here I enjoy. Not an equal substitute for the European masterpieces, but a darn good buy at around $4/bottle ~ remember two bits goes to the brothers! Amen!"
"The beer pours a dark amber color with a thick frothy off-white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is decent. It has a nice malty scent that boasts of caramel and roasted malts. The yeast also gives off quite a bit of fruity esters. The taste is decent as well. It has a dry caramel/roasted malt flavor that goes down easy and finishes with a good deal of yeast fruitiness. It's not as complex as I would like and the mouthfeel is lacking. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a decent beer, but not the best dubbel around. Still, it's good to see these guys branching out into different styles."
"Could drink several bombers. A great find."
"It is darker and maltier, but not heavy. I can see why the website recommends it with dessert foods, it certainly was nice after dinner."
"drinkability is good for $4 ill drink 22oz."
"Salude!!!!"
"Light body. Lightly carbonated"
"D- After the first couple sips I thought I would enjoy this beer. It seemed atypical for the style, but that doesn't bother me. But the further down the glass I got, this one really seemed to drag. This was largely do to the issues in mouthfeel. Similar to Abita's Andygator, this beer has to potential, but there are significant kinks that need to be hammered out for it to be an adequate representation of a Dubbel."
"Too much nutmeg to want to go back to this again."
"Pours a three finger off-white head that fades slowly leaving a good lace. Clear mahogany/amber color. Good carbonation and medium bodied. Dark fruit nose. Flavor is sweet and sour dark fruit - that's different but it is very drinkable. Higher ABV is hidden. $3.99 for a 22oz bottle from Beverage Warehouse Winooski, VT."
"Not bad. Poured a nice, thick, fine, very light tan head that lasts and some lace. Color is a clear medium amber. Aroma is caramel, malt, earth, yeast, and a bit of funk. Flavor is like nose, plus some definite sweet fruitiness and just a tad of bitterness in the background and on the back of the tongue. Body is decent and so is carbonation. Finish is like flavor and of medium length. Perhaps a tad sweet for my sessions."
"The Abita Abbey Ale pours a deep copper almost brown color with a nice fizzy off white head. Smell is sweet with raisins and cloves with a nice malt backbone. Taste is very nice. Raisins, yeast, and apricots make up most of the quaff. Minimal hop presence. Some alcohol is also noted on the palate. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and well carbonated. Drinkability is solid. I would like to see how this one develops in the bottle. Good work from a new brewery to me."
"jd"
"Pours a clear, brown/amber color. One inch head of a pale tan color. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of yeast, sweet malt, clove, hint of citrus (banana), hint of alcohol, hint of hops, and a hint of wheat. Fits the style of an Abbey Ale. Mouth feel is smooth and creamy, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of yeast, sweet malt, clove, hint of wheat, hint of dark citrus, and a hint of hops. Only complaint, is that the feel and body were a little weak."
"It poured a dark auburn and a bit cloudy. I was surprised by how dark it was, however, it had a nice thick caramel colored head that left rings as I drank it. The nose was peanuts and cloves. It has a malty, rich mouthfeel and a hint of apricot. I'm not a big fan of cloves but I can appreciate the big part it plays in this beer. The finish is long but not overwhelming. This beer has a nice Belgian style but was definitely American-ised by Abita. They did a great job and I can see having this beer with some pork chops and applesauce."
"Given the foam explosion, and the unfortunate aftermath, it's obvious that this bomber of Abita Abbey Ale isn't as the brewers intended. However, I don't believe the bottle is infected. Maybe you'll have better luck, but it's probably best to stick with the Belgian brasseries for your well-brewed dubbel needs."
"D- I could drink this dubbel for a long time if it was not 8 abv. fantastic. A rather impressive offering from the brewery I first became acquainted with while doing recover work post Katrina!"
"Abita did a very nice job of pegging the dubbel style, with a very authentic yeasty funk going on, overlying some moderately sweet caramel and prune notes. A bit of prickly carbonation, and the 8% abv was well blended into the flavor profile, lending a touch of pepper."
"Drinkability is pretty good enjoyable not the best Dubbel but damn nice try for an American Brewer thats not know for great brews anyway. Cheap easy drinking nothing really over distracting certainly worth a try maybe more then one."
"Should probably try again."
"All I can say is that this is done quiet well and worth trying. Lots of flavor. Easy to drink."
"Medium bodied, long finish, wonderful dubbel from Louisiana, who would have thunk it."
"Pours a somewhat murky brown with a fairly decent creamy head that sticks around but leaves no real lacing. Smells very sweet, with lots of residual sugars and a bit of clove. Tastes softer and more subtle than expected after the nose, but with a slightly metallic finish. Soft, lightly spicy, and relatively creamy in the mouth, but a little jagged right in the mouth. Decent and drinkable, if not superlative."
"Pours a reddish brown, hazy, with moderately sized off-white head. Nose has some bready notes, whiff of bubblegum (not in a bad way), and candy. On the palate there's plenty of the candied-gummy flavors coming through with some bready flavors, and a sweet/tangy finish. Not bad on drinkability."
"Did not enjoy this one that much. The flavor isn't there, this is a lot like Chimay Blue, and it's very mild, to mild in my opinion. I prefer the supposedly inferior Chimay Red, much more flavor."
"Overall, I think it is an impressive beer especially since it is coming from Abita, who is known for very ""sessionable"" beers. I like seeing breweries trying things off their normal path. It is definitely worth a try, and you might just need a buddy to finish it with you."
"A good solid offering from Abita."
"Drinkability is okay. The sweet-spicey aspect begins to take its toll about halfway through, making the bottle a bit hard to finish."
"220z bomber. Pours an amber color topped with a frothy 3 finger head with good retention. The aroma is extreme malt accented by a variety of sweet fruits. It sits solidly on the tongue, well balanced, not too sticky on the finish, the alcohol is present but not overbearing. A sold effort by Abita."
"The taste is sweet, fruity, and malty with a bit of peppery spice and an earthy yeast flavor. Nice smooth and thick body, and great drinkability."
"D: It's good, but not great. You can handle a bomber, and the alcohol is well hidden, but nothing out of this world."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, chewy, sweet, and dry."
"Taste follows suit closely as the Belgian yeast presence is very strong, contributing doughy bread and ripe fruits galore. Some tartness is in there as well as plenty of candi sugar sweetness to give it some depth. Maybe even some dark brown sugar comes to the party. It seems a year in the cellar has done this beer well, surprisingly. There is still a noticeable leafy hop and toast bitterness on the finish. Not necessarily complex, but has plenty to offer, flavorwise. ABV is not exactly well hidden, but neither is it offensively brash. I would not hesitate to buy another bottle or two to see what happens, especially at 4 bucks a bomber. Not bad at all for Abita's first foray into the world of Belgian beers, I recommend they try some more!"
"Decent brew and worth it for the price."
"Mouthfeel is thin, lacking body. Great to see something so unexpected from Abita, but could use more complexity and depth of flavor IMO."
"D: Not a bad brew but not a great one either. Doesn't seem to hit the style exactly but very drinkable."
"An interesting yeast culture going on here. With significant exposure the beer opens up to become rather pleasant. A light malt presence for the style, yet typical for Abita, accompanies a decent feel. Bottom line for me is that the aroma is an insurmountable obstacle for this brew. Bon Chance.."
"This was a good one."
"Overall Drinkability - 4.0 - A good solid Belgian-like beer. This is almost more like a lightly hopped American Brown to me than an Abbey Ale, because there is no yeast character. Very enjoyable beer, just not the full abbey experience I was hoping for."
"D: Its drinkable but would not purchase again. It's on par with Abita's other brews."
"D: The first drink I accidentally swallowed without tasting - something about this drives you to swallow without savoring, but it also leaves some sort of odd aftertaste. Although it disappears quickly and leaves with a final pleasant aroma, something is a bit off here. It's not enough to ruin the overall experience, and is still a worthy beer to try out."
"d - Overall this was a decent dubbel. I thought the taste was a little too sweet, but the smell was pretty good. For the cost (I paid $3.99) it was well worth it and I wouldn't mind trying it again, but I wouldn't go out of my way for it."
"Well, I paid $3.99 for this bomber and that's about what I got out of it.. I loved the Andygator and was hoping for more of the same out of this but I was disappointed here.."
"Drinkability-very very drinkable although I couldnt drink it al night long"
"RJT"
"I was excited to find this bottle in SE CT since I'd only heard of Abita, but I found this beer a little lack-lustre compared to other abbey style beers. It was too sweet and I was turned off by the initial bready taste. I'm definitely excited to see what else Abita has to offer."
"Taste is vert trappist-like. Has some nice sweetness, light raisin hints and sweet maltiness. Nice light mouthfeel and carbonation, it's present but not over the top."
"d: i don't know; i didn't find this enjoyable and I find this especially strange for the style."
"please pass on this one."
"Drinkability overall is quite enjoyable and for anybody with an interest in Abita it's nice to see the transformation from where I started drinking their brews almost ten years ago to the post Katrina professional machine that Abita has become with effective distribution and adventurous new big beer lineup coming out. This is the second in that classification, I'm sad to say that I missed the helles doppelbock Andygator."
"Abita hits you with a 22oz Abbey style ale. This was a nice rendition of a long time personal favorite (my all time favorite being Orval). Poured a cloudy orangy/beige color. The nose was swimming with different flavors, yeast and bread dough come to mind. The taste is layered in complexity with banana, cloves, yeast, and spice. A hardy beer."
"Overall a good smelling and tasting beer with a nice abv strength. Definately will return to this brew at a later date."
"*notes from Jan. 4th 2010"
"This isn't extremely complex, but it's definitely good, and at something like $4 for a bomber, which is about the lowest I've ever seen for a larger craft brew bottle, it's a great alternative to some of the pricier dubbels out there. I will be getting this again."
"D- Nice drinkable beer that I would love to sip on more than this once."
"First sip had a strong bite. Slight tartness but overall drinkable."
"Mahogany in color and quite clear out of the bomber and into my glass. About a finger of beige head. Smells of over ripe bananas, cloves, and raisins. Also a touch of pumpkin. Very sweet once it hits your mouth. Lots of spices present as well. Almost reminds me of carrot cake. It has a sense of breadiness to it. The banana that is so present in the nose is more subtle in the taste. There is also a slight citric bittering towards the finish lending to a relatively dry finish. This got better the further into the bomber I got. I'd probably have this again if I happened upon it."
"overall its a solid beer. i prefer abita's other big beer, andygator, over this."
"Overall, it's not a great representation of style, and Abita has many other brews that are more than acceptable and rather good. The price point for this doesn't do much justification either."
"Mouthfeel was not as carbonated as one would expect. Medium bodied."
"I'm always appreciative of an American brewer trying to make a Belgian style beer. Sometimes they even manage to nail it. This is not one of those times. While not a bad beer by any means, it still needs some work to be mentioned among the better beers of this style."
"Comments: A delicious malty, sweet beer that at $5 is an excellent value. I'm still new to beer reviewing, but this is one of the most spiced beers I've tried recently and the banana flavor is quite interesting....almost like a dunkelweisen on steroid malts, though at times it becomes almost cloyingly sweet."
"Drinkability: I really love the way Abita tackles bigger beers. this is nice and malty. I like the flavor combos. It is a very clean, bready beer that I will have again."
"D-- Needs to be a bit sweeter I think. ABV is apparent but later in drinking this. Smell is very good but the rest fails. There are better US attempts in Dubbles out there.One is enough."
"Not bad to get a 22 oz bottle for $5 in NY, but overall this beer was just OK. I'd grab a real Belgian before I grabbed this again, especially considering that I really like some of Abita's other beers (TurboDog, Purple Haze, Jockamo IPA, Strawberry Harvest Lager, etc.)."
"Good example of style, but not one that I'd necessarily go back to again."
"The mouth is light but also somewhat syrupy at beginning, with a drier finish. This is a nice sipping beer but about average IMHO."
"Sorry to those who enjoyed it, but I didn't care much for this beer. I won't be having it again."
"Next time I see a bottle, I will try it again, but this was not, by any means, a stale bottle...I got it directly from the distributor, so it hadn't been sitting on the shelf somewhere for months. Again, I will give it another chance, and I hope to change my mind."
"Poured from a 22-oz bomber into a chalice glass. Pours reddish brown with no real head. Smells of canned peaches, molases, and lilies. Tastes sharp and citrusy up front, with a nice mellow caramel warmth in the back. Very nice, definitely the best Abita I've had. Mouthfeel is sticky and nicely carbonated. Very drinkable, with a nice low alcohol warmth and a balanced feel. Maybe a bit sweet for some but a fault I can easily forgive. For charity, of course."
"Drinkability: an interesting take on the Dubbel style. There are better and there are definitely worse. For $3.99, I can't complain."
"A big burst of bubbles results in a nice-sized dark tan head that sticks for a bit before dying out and leaving a thin lacing with some spots strewn above here and there. Color is ruby red with some reddish-orange hues where the light hits. Sweet bread and dark sour fruits rise to the nose. A damp earthiness works itself into the mix after a slight shake of the glass. Tastes malty and grainy with some lighter fruits in the background. Some hops and a boozy alcohol heat work into the mix later on. Overall the taste is a little weak, and there's something a little off in the balance, but it's not so bad as to ruin the experience. Mouth-feel is medium bodied, as is the carbonation. Not as bad as expected, but needs some refinement in some key areas."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1"" tan head over the clear reddish copper brew. Head recedes ever-so slowly, with average lacing. Aroma is sweet, heavy on the fruits, and some light earthiness. Taste mirrors the nose, but the close is alcoholic and harsh. Mouthfeel is soft over the tongue, but limited by the harsh close, with drinkability being alright. These new Abita 22s have not been a deal."
" Sure the price tag was nice ($3.99), but it's not even worth that."
"Pours a wonderful red/brown in the glass with relatively little head. Obvious smell of fruit, but not as much so as a lot of other dubbels. A very pleasant, tasty beer. Drinks a little lighter than a lot of dubbels, with the sense of alcohol and yeast a little less obvious. As a result the beer isn't as complex as the best examples of the style, but is still very pleasant and easy to drink, though perhaps slightly too sweet. A very enjoyable beer though, especially for the price."
"M + D: Considering the style, the body comes across on being a little lighter. I'd still consider it to be 'of medium body,' but a bit milder than many out there. It doesn't have the shimmering richness that many classic Belgians do, which is unfortunate, as it's a wonderful feeling over the tongue. Alcohol is pretty much completely hidden, however, which makes the ABV seem far more tame. White it doesn't really becoming sickly and cloying, it is a little too sweet, though."
"Pours a beautiful sunrise red with a good looking tan head that takes its time settling. Smells fruity and yeasty, a bit of bubblegum and dark fruits. Not as fragrant as most dubbels but not bad. Tastes sweet, a bit like prunes with a finish that leaves a funky prune taste lingering. This beer isn't bad but does not rank with many other easily accessible dubbels."
"d - tasty, balanced, and enjoyable. not exactly transcendence in a glass, but well worth the price of admission. definitely a food beer, not a stand-alone sipper. called Abbey Ale, but described as a Dubbel on the bottle. at 8% ABV, I'm inclined to go with the latter. I'll make it a point to share a bottle with a fellow beer dork who only thinks of Abita in terms of Purple Haze or Turbo Dog (as I most certainly did prior to drinking this)."
"D - Definitialy one of the better beers that Abita is putting out pretty good for the style worth trying sometie"
"Grab an Abita Abbey if you're looking to try a unique, abbey style ale. It's delicious."
"Verdict: It may have a hard time competing with the Belgian originals, but Abita have brewed up a pretty damn decent Dubbel here. Just watch out for the well hidden alcohol punch."
"All-in-all, a good Dubbel with a lot of flavor and not overwhelming alcohol profile. I'd get it again, but I can't put it with my favorites."
"This is an excellent Abbey Ale. The color was a deep-golden with hues of orange. The smell of soft malts and hops had a magnificent aroma. The taste had a sweet maltiness and mild hops flavor. Overall, Fruity aroma, soft, sweet maltiness and just a pleasant tasting Ale. One of Abita's better beers!"
"Served in a chalice from a nicely painted bottle. Chestnut brown color with a thick head. Fruity aroma. Taste is also dominated by a fruity, raisiny type of character, along with a biscuity malt and very little bitterness. Not the most complex Dubbel I've tasted, but certainly a strong effort by a brewery I've never associated with Belgian styles."
"Large bottle, with nice artwork etched onto the bottle, a decent deal at $4.99 purchased from Big Z bev on good ole Long Island, NY. Pours muddy chocolate/brownish amber, khaki short lived head, but leaving plenty of sheeting and fine lacing. Sweet dubbel, with light chocolate, toffee and malty notes. Ripe fruit adds some complexity. Nothing special, just an easy drinking beginner friendly Belgian style brew, with a well hidden 8% jolt"
"A fair bit of character to this one - perhaps not the layered complexity of some of the better examples, but the important elements are there. It's got the pleasant light body and hidden alcohol of a good dubbel, so at least it's readily drinkable. Not a bad drop at all."
"Overall I like this beer. It is a good ale and I enjoy the flavors that are present."
"This is an interesting beer that starts out great, and finishes alright. The appearance is a nice, dark caramel color with a slight haze to it. The scent is sweet and malty. The taste is just average. That's the surprise. The smell and appearance lead me to expect a full bodied malty taste. This brew has a light taste that has no hop bite or any other flavors that hit the back of the tongue. All of the taste is felt on the front half of the mouth. The short finish makes the beer an easy one to drink. You wouldn't know that it was 8%."
"Overall it's a really nice abbey-style beer. A little bit more depth of character to the maltiness (perhaps a stronger hint of cocoa or soft milk chocolate?) would be great, and a tighter focus on the balance (softening the bitterness in the finish, and smoothing the sweetness at the outset - eliminating the minor vegetal note) would make this quite nice. Drinkable though! The alcohol is pretty well cloaked. Worth trying."
"drinkability is nice. decent balance, unbalanced towards sweetness but hiding its alcohol fairly well. just not a very exciting beer."
"22oz bomber into a Duvel snifter a crisp bubbly dark orange almost brown with a nice frothy khaki head that lasts as a thin layer and leaves great lacing. Aroma is a nice amount of brown malts and dried fruits. The taste is an interesting blend of fruits, spice and malt, but a bit on the bland side, as is the case with most Abita beers. The beer is medium bodied with some present alcohol. This one ended up being just about what I expected, Abita's half-ass attempt at a Belgian."
"A pretty decent dubbel that is worth a try; nothing spectacular though."
"Flavor is decidedly better than the aroma, starting with notes of toasted biscuit, amber malt, and spicy hops. Transitions midway to fruits and booze, with sour apple, rum, and whiskey coming to mind. Mouthfeel is a bit thinner than most Dubbels, with a spicy heat and slightly dry finish that somewhat limits its drinkability. Overall, a solid Belgian interpretation from Abita; recommended, but I'll likely pass on this in the future with so many better options."
"Pours a cloudy amber/orange, very bright in the light, thick light tan ring forms, great retention, some nice chunks of lacing stick to the glass. Smell is nice, lots of caramel and raisin maltiness, fruity, kind of nutty, some toast and biscuits, lightly grainy, pretty interesting. Taste is similar, sweet and fruity at first, some raisins and brown sugar, apricots and some tropical fruit, lightly vegetal, yeasty, some graininess and caramel in the finish, not bad. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium carbonation. Pretty interesting and tasty ale, although the graininess is something I would say shouldn't really be in a Belgian ale. Still, I liked it. Thanks Greg!"
"Gargantuan head on the pour, three fingers plus with many super-large bubbles, steadily settles down into a think layer across the surface, leaves a thick, frothy lacing behind. Copper red to brown in color, average darkness. Moderate penetration to the nose, golden raisin, date and clove spice, then fresher peach to banana fruit, cocoa and carob, the malt dimension actually less forceful than expected, allows for a trace of mixed white citrus and something like celery to come through, overall drifts off slowly like a cloud on the horizon. Medium-bodied with a thick foaminess in the mouth, more of a smoky, caramelized character to the chocolate, toffee flavors than in the nose. The banana and esters ratcheted up, less concentrated date or glazed fruit aspects. The clove, nutmeg in the house, yet, the mineral water derived dry freshness opposes the deepening of any sweetness. Not especially yeasty nor bready, there is some moss or wet underbrush tones, again perhaps linkable to the mineral water. A touch monochrome but not a chore to drink."
"The Abbey Ale pours with a decent head and looks nice. The aroma is a bit off-putting, though. I appreciate the phenolic character of some Belgian yeasts, and there's some of that ""goodness"" in this brew, but there's also some bad phenols as well. (For reference, I would say Chimay red or blue has a very good phenolic character.) The taste is better than the aroma, but the ""bad"" phenols are still there. This is an interesting attempt at an Abbey ale and one that almost works, but ultimately it needs more finesse. Much like the Andygator, the flavors in this brew don't quite gel and makes me think the recipe needs more time to work out the kinks. Well, to be honest, I had Andygator a number of years ago when it was still draft-only. I thought it was ""odd...if not off"" back then, and I still think it tastes the same in the new bottled form. Odd... Whatever the case, this Abbey Ale is a better Abita beer than most other Abita brews out there. Hey Abita, I'm still pulling for you. Seriously, keep trying with the special release bomber series. I still have faith that you guys can make some killer brews!"
"Overall it is a pretty good Dubbel, especially for the price."
"Very dark brown/orange in color with a nice thick head. Wonderful fruit/malt nose. Nice creamy mouth feel. Flavors are layered and complex of fruit, carmel, malt and clove. A very pleasant dried apricot light hop finish. Best Arbita brew I've tried. Great take on an Abbey Ale."
"d: very drinkable. I like my abbey's a little drier, less malty and more interesting, but this is a very nice malt forward example and very easy to drink."
"This poured a hazy dark copper with fluffy light tan head. It smelled like strong wild Belgian yeast and salt, with banana and apricot and vinegar, and a bit of earthy caramel. It tasted like sour wild yeast and salt and apricot, with some banana and nutty malt. It was slightly thick with some carbonation, and had a sour aftertaste. Overall this had a very clean flavor, but it wasn't very enjoyable for my tastes, with a dominent sour character. To me, dubbels should be maltier. It had good body and was fairly easy to drink. This wasn't necessarily a bad beer, but I don't think it fit the style and it definitely isn't the type of Belgian ale I personally prefer."
"Thanks to deepsouth for this extra in a trade! Nice painted label bottle. Pours a nice dark amber color with a small head that was gone quickly, leaving sparse lacing. Aroma is Belgian yeast, clove, caramel, light chocolate notes, bready, warm. Flavor is nice! Good amount of Belgian yeast, some burnt toffee and caramel, a touch of chocolate, light raisin, dark fruit, light spiciness. Not really complex, but can't complain. It tastes good. Alcohol is a little too prevalent, though. A bit thin on the tongue, alcohol warmth is there, but it's fairly well integrated. A nice take on the style."
"This isn't a bad dubbel. I find most beers from Abita to be pretty average, but this is a solid try at a Dubbel, and I liked it better than Allagash Dubbel."
"Overall, I can definitely see buying this on occasion as something of a treat for my boyfriend, who likes the sweet Belgian-style beers a lot but doesn't have the world's most discriminating palate. In fact, I might let him have the other half of this one ... not because it's at all bad, but because I suspect he'd very much love it."
"D=good but not quite sessionable a little to sweet"
"D- Overal, I am very impressed with this beer. It has definitely exceeded my expectations. Recommended!"
"A deep amber color, more like a light mohoganey, with a thick half inch high head top. The head lasts substatially long and clings to the glass for some time. The scent of malt is strong, with bread like fragrances. The yeast brings it spiciness and fruity esters along for the ride. The taste has the malt at the front, almost like a spicy bread, touches of sweet spices nutmeg and cinnamon, and dried fruit. I am tasting some chocolate, don't why but I am, it then ends mild earthy bitterness. A creamy texture at the front. thinning itself out as it rolls across the palate. A mild dry finish on the back end, with slight crispness to follow. The flavors do not seem to meld together, though the look and feel are very appealing, taste is what makes a beer. There are just to many things going on in the taste that hamper this beer from becoming a very good one."
"Hmmm. Don't quite know what to think of this one. Some recognizable Dubbel qualities and some other flavors I particuarly care for. Considerably better as it warmed."
"The aroma is fruity and yeasty with malt. The appearance is amber with with an average head. The flavor is average too despite tasting like the aroma. The palate is thin. Overall it is better than average but not by a lot. This is worth a try but don't expect too much."
"Again Abita brews a beer that is drinkable but could have been better. While I cannot say I won't buy it again, it won't be on top of the list. Of course, that's a moot point until I get back to Louisiana."
"Overall this is a solid dubbel and one of the better Abita brews I've had, worth a shot."
"D: I've been pretty underwhelmed by most of Abita's brews so far, but this is a respectable American shot at a Belgian Dubbel. Easy to drink and visually appealing. For $3.99 a bomber, not too hard on the wallet either."
"This is an excellent Dubbel, on par with the best Belgian ones. Recommended."
"poured out of its 22 oz bottle cold, into a non-chilled chalice glass. appears a very nice amber/golden color. head is thick, with a creamy texture and off-white pale color. smells like a yeasty, strong dubbel. cloves and spices dominate the scent , which is accompanied by a hint of sweetness. you do smell the alcohol also. the taste is surprisingly alot like the smell, in that its not nearly as sweet as some of the other dubbels out there, which was a bit strange to me, but not at all off-putting. alcohol is pronounced, as well as the yeasts and roasted malts. has a real hearty, earthy quality about it. this brew also has a nice bitter and spiciness to it, with some subtle fruitiness, though not really in a sweet way. i thought it tasted better as it warmed slightly. the body was pretty thick, medium to almost heavy. i liked the thickness, and the creamy head stayed and lazily trickled down the edges of the glass as drank it. despite being rather thick, it was very drinkable...i would recommend this beer to anyone who likes belgians of any style. i would also agree with some other reviewers in that this seems more like a tripel than dubbel. a fine offering from abita, probably the best specialty beer they have done yet."
"Easy to drink with the 8% alcohol seeming somewhat tame. Definetly worth a try for the style and the price."
"First time with this brewer. Poured a clear copper with a big, creamy white head. Decent lacing. Sweet yeast and herbal aroma, with a malty gingerbread scent. Thick, but not syrupy, mouthfeel. Stronger than expected in the spiciness; again, like gingerbread. A noticeable clove and banana flavor as well. Turns sweet and fruity towards the finish. No heavy malt or sugar flavors I expected with a dubbel. Leans more towards a trippel in spice and yeast. I liked it."
"Pours a very nice two finger tan head, but it disappears pretty quick. No stickage. A tawny and rose colored amber brown with some ok tiny bubbles. Caramelized sugar, toffee, yeasty fruit, and some warm alcohol. Toasted malts with a little caramel and a some hot alcohol that cuts through yeasty fruits and herbal hops. The malt thins out quickly and finishes on moreof a boozey note than any thing else. Pretty hot palate, especially as the beer warms."
"This one is smooth and easy to drink. For a belgian style, it is surprisingly sessionable."
"D - I would recommend this beer to a freind as a drinkable beer."
"Pretty decent atmosphere. Nose is complex, and spread out but really balanced with a nice collections of malty and sweet aromas. Flavor also offers complexity, and great balance. It is sweet and syrupy, but not overwhelmingly so. Balanced with a spicy pungency, and mitigated by a strong alcohol feel. Aftertaste stands out, but is not arresting. Great quaff."
"I had never seen an Abita beer in a 22 ounce bottle before. My only experience with their beers was the Turbodog at one of Emeril's restaurants. Overall it was a pretty good beer. Would like to see what else these guys are planning to do."
"Drinks great for the style & abv; maybe the single best beer I've had from these guys. I always thought their mainstream stuff,was well, too damn middle of the road, this one rocks, well done Abita!"
"Pours a huge foamy yellowish colored head, big bubbles. Very clear medium brown body. Good lacing, sticks to the sides. Very bready, banana, some clove in the aroma. Very floral. Strong banana and some spices. Some alcohol in the nose too. Very creamy mouthfeel, some light sweetness. Floral taste, but very light tasting. Pretty drinkable. Letting it warm up a bit...still very light and floral. Very typical of a belgian style beer. They hit it on the head with this one. A little too sweet to drink too much of."
"I like this a lot more than ratings may indicate. It needs a lot of warmth to fully get to normalcy but this like the drunk absent-minded professor on speed and coke trying to grade a bunch of finals. Probably not a style-perfect example but this is entertaining and enjoyable stuff. Good to see Abita do something a little over the edge."
"While it may not be as agreeable as its Belgian counterparts, I believe this may one of the finest examples of an American-made Dubbel I've had the pleasure of tasting."
"Pours a hazy ruddy brown color with a small white head. Very slight lacing. Aroma is slightly carmally and slightly belgian yeast phenolic. Taste is like a caramel covered prune. The mouthfeel is about average for a belgian style dubbel. Nothing really stands out with this beer. Just an average dubbel with not much character."
"Hats off to Abita - I did not expect them to deliver at this level with the new big beer series, they have done a very nice job. I wish there were more dubbels of this pedigree in the US. Yes, the belgian specialists hit well, but too few others try. This is an americanized version of the style, but it works quite well."
"Appearance is opaque dark amber with bright red hues. I poured a 2-finger tan head with minimal lacing. It smells of caramel malts, yeast, allspice, cloves, and dark fruits--perfect smell for a Dubbel. Unfortunately, the taste just doesn't live up to the smell. The flavor is dark fruits, yeast, some spice, but there's an odd bitter, medicinal aftertaste that many Abita offerings have. Mouthfeel is smooth with a acidic kick at the end. This is a drinkable beer, but the taste/mouthfeel just don't live up to some of the better Dubbels."
"D - Would be ideal with a cigar. A nice effort by Abita."
"mouth feel is thick with yeast and approaching sticky. medium bodied. 6/3/5/3/12/2.9"
"Good drinkability. A solid beer over all."
"This might not be the best Dubble ever made, but it is still exceptional. Probably the best beer from Abita that I have tried. Something I would recommend."
"A decent beer that comes out better than most American attempts at the style, but still lacking complexity, balance, and restraint that make Belgian Abbey Ales the best beers in the world."
"The taste is spiced up with herbal hop notes, slight roasted character, and peet. Smooth fruit finish with some faint hops in the finish. Good beer"
"Drinkability: It's nice. Typically, I'm not a huge fan of their offerings, but this is actually an admirable shot at a dubbel by Abita."
"Drinkability - a pretty good dubbel. I tend to like 'em a little less olive-y and a little sweeter, but this is nice."
"Mouthfeel is a little thin with slight carbonation. The alcohol starts to become more noticeable midway through, bringing down drinkability a little bit. Still this is something I would like to have again. Overall this was a very pleasant surprise from a brewery that really hasn't produced anything all that special in my book. This is easily my favorite offering from Abita and I hope they'll take the hint and start bottling some of their other Select brews in the future."
"Drinkability is low because of the alcohol taste. You have to be too careful with this when the flavor isn't up to par."
"Nicely done Abita."
"I poured the abbey ale into a Chimay glass. It is an amber color and had a medium sized head with good lacing. The smell was decently complex. It seemed to be a nice mix of sour and sweetness. I could smell some fruits in there as well (what appeared to be banana and plum). While drinking the beer I noticed it was a bit milder. It is a bit tangy and sweet with a little banana coming through. The mouthfeel is better than in most Abita beers. It's still just a tad too thin, but the carbonation is decent. It is a decent beer for the price and the best Abita makes."
"D - This is a good American attempt at a Belgian, comes at a great price, but to me leaves a little to be desired in a Dubbel, but still a good stab from Abita, rivals the IPA as my favorite beer from them"
"Overall, i plan on buying this one a lot, especially with the price i got it at being at $3.69 for the bomber. It is a refreshing dubbel that still carries a complexity and spiciness to it. I don't think I'd say its an incredible dubbel, but it still is pretty tasty. I am finding myself drinking this one rather quickly; the presence of alcohol is low and the drinkability is quite high."
"Pours a hazy, dark amber with a two finger tan foam cap. Decent retention and lacing. Smells strongly of yeast and banana/date esters, as well as a good bit of doughy malt and some spice. Tastes of sweet malt and tangy yeast, as well as more banana and quite a bit of spiciness. Medicinal phenols are almost overwhelming at times. Some bitterness at the finish. Mouthfeel is thick, but slightly syrupy. The phenols make it somewhat unpleasant to put down."
"Had this at Lagers and it was a pretty damn good beer. Not a proper pour or glass so rating is not a truly proper rating. They will be bottling this in January 2009 so will do another review then. Overall though the beer was great and the alcohol(8%) was masked extremely well. Perhaps a little too well as I had three and was feeling pretty good but had to drive home."
"I made a recent visit to the brewpub in Abita Springs and had this on-tap along with a cask doppelbock and satsuma wit. This was served in a pint glass instead of a goblet, but I rarely get proper glassware anywhere. Had a nice aroma of dark fruit. Taste was similar to the aroma. Little carbonation, head, or lacing, and mouthfeel was correct for the style. Hid the alcohol fairly well. Good beer."
"Definitely check this one out if you come across it on tap in S. LA, and look for the bottles in 2009 sometimes."
