I love the Dubbel style and this is a fantastic example from a world class brewery. This beer screams ""Cellar me!!"" I have not tried a fresh example but the cellared ones are worth every penny.","ClavisAurea","Mar 29, 2015"

Sorry, I couldn't resist, but it is true!  Loved those things.  Candied fruit is at the front of the flavor profile as well with a warm, smooth, boozy finish.  Goose Island brings it again for me.

4.18,6.9,4.25,4.25,4.25,4,4,"Bottle from July 2012 poured into tulip glasses and shared.  Beautiful clear chestnut brown color with half finger of slightly off-white head that dissipates and leaves minimal lacing.  Nice dried fruit and Belgian candy aroma.  Taste is delicious and perfect to the style - raisins, currants, dried apricot, candy, and a slight sharp bitterness to offset the sweet.  Mouth feel was dryer than I expected, making the beer seem thin for style, but actually probably makes it more drinkable.  Overall, a pretty solid take on the Belgian Dubbel, albeit a bit pricey in this case ($9.50 for 22 oz).","FFreak","Jan 22, 2015"

Aroma is exceptional as well, at first you can smell the 8% alcohol, but then it opens up to some fruitiness (notably raisins or bubble gum), and then a slight matly smell to finish. Taste is not as great as the aroma, still pleasant though. First upon entering my mouth, like the aroma, first taste was the alcohol content, but as it sits in your mouth the fruitiness comes to life and the after taste is that of smoky maltiness. The mouthfeel is very creamy, which is deceptive, as it looks like a very thin bodied beer. Overall a good beer, could be one of the best I've had if the flavor was a bit better. I'd have it time and time again though, for sure!","anthony23cippy","Sep 16, 2014"

Poured into my tulip glass. Nothing tremendous on appearance... unfiltered (that's ok), 1/2 finger of head was gone quickly, interesting mahogany hue. The aroma was awesome... raisins and dark fruit, apples or pears, molasses, and of course, Belgium. Aside from the presence of alcohol in the taste, all of the aromas were strong in the flavor profile. Not a ton of the 'funk', and overall a great flavor balance. Velvety mouthfeel... one of the most enjoyable I have tried for mouthfeel. Overall, this was excellent... great balance to this beer, and a pleasant surprise. As a big IPA and stout guy, before long I might be drawn to more of the Belgian styles... pick one up.","Mikus","Jul 20, 2014"

Pours moderately cloudy ruby copper color with a 1 finger fairly dense khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a thin lace cap that lingers. Slight spotty lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big raisin, prune, fig, pear, apple, light banana, brown sugar, toffee, toast, clove, light pepper, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of fruity/earthy yeast ester and dark malt notes; with great strength. Taste of raisin, prune, fig, pear, apple, light banana, caramel, toast, toffee, brown sugar, brown bread, light chocolate, clove, light pepper, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Light earthy spiciness on the finish; with lingering notes of raisin, prune, fig, pear, apple, caramel, toast, toffee, brown sugar, brown bread, light chocolate, clove, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice complexity and robustness of fruity/earthy yeast and dark/bready malt flavors; with a great malt/yeast flavor balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth and fairly slick/bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice dubbel style. All around good balance, complexity, and robustness of fruity/earthy yeast and dark malt flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the ABV. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","May 13, 2014"

It's not perfect, but it's still a very high-quality beer that manages to justify its hefty price point (at least in this province, where it is priced about the same as a bottle of mid-tier wine). All Belgian ale aficionados should consider this one worth at least one purchase, as it makes for an excellent warmer for the fall/winter months.

Rich amber-brown hue, although not a lot of head with minimal lacing. Smells aromatic enough to pass for a Belgian... Taste is pretty well in line as well. Really good attempt and one that wouldn't mind having again. Definitely a reccomendation. Cheers!","SoupKitchenBeerSnob","Feb 19, 2014"

3.67,-6.1,3.5,4,3.5,4,3.5,"Pours a murky copper color (similar to apple cider) with a meager tan head that disappears in short order. Aroma is largely of caramel with some alcohol and a mild fruitiness. The caramel malt dominates the flavor profile, though the considerable alcohol is even more pronounced than in the nose. Some Belgian yeast, dark fruit, and vanilla can be found as well. The carbonation could be a little higher to help augment the sweetness, but this is a minor grievance. Dubbels aren't exactly my favorite style, but as far as dubbels go, this is pretty good, though the alcohol could be concealed a little better. Goose Island continues to demonstrate a skillful hand at Belgian style brews.","MaximalC","Aug 21, 2012"

Dark sugars and fruits with burnt raisin thing going on. Medium body with a light level of carbonation and a sweet slick mouthfeel. I was worried that I had sat on this one too long, but it all worked out. Nice brew that reminds me a bit of an aged barleywine or a dopplebock.

Maybe two fingers of cream colored foam crown the beer, but head retention and lacing are far too brief and clean, respectively. The nose is fantastic, lots of plum layered with other dark fruits. A little bit of pepper and clove come through as well, just enough to keep things interesting. Unfortunately that nose doesn't fully translate to the flavor profile, as the estery portion of the beer fades rather quickly, just a flash of sweet plums and raisins. The dominant phenol profile is a bit less spicy than in the aroma,very little pepper and just a lot of clove. The body is suitably light, but the carbonation falls dull on the palate. Dubbel is one of my favorite Belgian styles, but Pere Jacques is just a bit off.","axeman9182","Jul 04, 2012"

The smell is a nice balance of bready malts with a touch of caramel sweetness and just a touch of belgian yeast esters. The taste is more of the same, the caramel and the yeast character combine with a touch of alcohol to give off a nice okay vanilla flavor. The mouthfeel is a bit syrupy but not in a bad way, it really coats the mouth. Overall this is a really interesting dubbel. The oaky vanilla almost implies a light barrel aging but instead seems to come from the ingredients themselves.

Aromas of rich, layered sweetness, including dates, raisins, plums, and a slight sugary highlight. Flavors are light and slightly sharp on the crisp body, and lead off with a tangy, slightly sour sweetness with all of the fruit profiles blending together. Earthy notes accent all of the sweetness to keep it from cloying. The beer transitions to a darkly sweet, rich aftertaste of roasted sweetness. A smooth, rich finish that stays light, with an increased carbonation. Decent, and fairly easy to drink.","GarthDanielson","Apr 07, 2012"

The color was a medium to dark amber with a nice, foamy head up top that lingers for a spell. The aroma was surprisingly sweet and while Dubbels can be sweet, this seemed a bit like overkill. There was a vague hop note on the backside. Except for the sweetness it seemed fairly well-balanced. The body was medium. The taste was also a bit more sweet than I might have liked and there was little to the finish. A slight letdown but not bad.","puboflyons","Aug 03, 2011"

I thought this beer was going in the right direction but there were too many things that made it rough around the edges. I thought it was weird that the aroma had such a dominating spice aspect to it but when it came to the taste the spices take the backseat to all those sweet and fruity flavors from the malts. I felt that it was just a touch too sweet and the alcohol could have been hidden better. What I liked the most about this beer was its nice and complex aroma and what I liked least about this beer was its high amount of sweetness and how much the 8% showed up. This beer doesn't have good drinkability it took me a while to drink the whole bottle and it was a bit of a struggle towards the end, I would never want to drink more then one of these. I don't think I would buy this again, it just didn't impress me, I would much rather have the Dubbel from Bridge Brew Works. If Dubbels are your thing you might want to give it a try, but don't expect to be wowed. This has been the best beer I have had from Goose Island, but that still doesn't make it a good beer, I have come to grips with the fact that I am just not into this brewery, but their line of Belgian beers always catches my attention, maybe I will give some of their other beers a chance but with their track record I doubt it.","StoutHunter","Jul 15, 2011"

Mouthfeel is thick yet smooth, carbonation is medium with large slow bubbles; afterfeel is surprisingly clean and smooth.

Lively body with a good amount of fizz but not overly so; piles of sediment at the end which I know people say you're supposed to leave in the bottle, but that's stupid-- drink the schmutz.

4.23,8.2,4,3.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"It pours very dark brown with some reddish notes and a light brown head. Nose is fruity brown ale, but the taste is a step up from that--incredibly complex, with layers of toffee, nuts, dark fruits, brown sugar, allspice, rum, apricot. It's on the sweet side, I suppose, but has so many layers of sweetness--and a healthy amount of spice--that it's a really great beer for dessert. I imagine it would also pair well with cheese or with a warm loaf of bread. The mouthfeel is really creamy and full, with a spritely carbonation that keeps it from weighing you down.

Hard to imagine the being sweeter, loaded with caramel, chocolate, toffee, brown sugar, molasses, prune, fig, plum, cherry and apricot fruit, orange marmalade, bubblegum, candied nuts, on the hops side has pine and flowers, nothing too biting. Full-bodied and on the heavy side, the carbonation has the texture of cotton candy, more gluey than lifting. In spite of this there’s more room for more focused clove, ginger and pepper spice, quinine and earth. This forestalls the eventual onslaught of caramel, toffee, molasses, maple syrup, chocolate and so on, the orange to lemon citrus retains that syrupy and candied character. More yeastiness here with that bubblegum to banana touch. Plum, fig, date, cherry, apricot, peach flavors, nice mix of darker and lighter fruits.

Heavy on sweetness which covers up the alcohol bite that was initially present and no astringency here either anymore. The mouthfeel has definitely gotten thicker with just a bit of cloying sweetness. Still plenty of carbonation here.

The 8.0% ABV was painfully obvious and made it slightly difficult to finish. This time I enjoyed it slightly chilled with a full dinner (spicy pasta alla carbonara and Greek salad) and the flavours of the beer were perfectly complimented and balanced by the meal. Trust me, accompany with this with a full-flavoured meal, it is an entirely different experience!","JohnnyChicago","Oct 11, 2010"

It featured a massive amount of sediment, which didn't take away at all. The smell was subtle and of candied fruit, and slightly sweet with slight alcohol aromas. The taste was exceptional. It was both yeasty and sweet, somewhat like candied fruit. The mouthfeel was extremely smooth with little carbonation and had a medium body. The aging definitely smoothed this one out quite a bit.

I was hoping for a hint of banana or some bubblegum, but it was not readily apparent. Felt really nice with some decent viscosity.

A little bit of a crackle of spice is evident as well. The carbonation is lively spirited and the beer finishes just ever so slightly dry and a medium body.

Has a lot of booze on the backend, but ,asked a bit by the quality of the dark stone fruits. Semi dry finish but has a sticky sweet aftertaste. Mouthfeel is a tad high in carbonation. I would like to see this a touch less carbonated. Also a bit thin on the palate for me though the flavors are still there.

Not much in the way of lacing, other than a few spots. Just a bit of sediment came out during the last pour. Sweet aroma, brown sugar and bread, toasty, spicy with slight alcohol. Low bitterness, balanced towards malty, sugary sweetness. More brown sugar flavour, toasted marshmallow in the background, lots of toasty malt, a bit fruity, figs and dried fruit, light alcohol and spice in the finish.

Unfortunately the mouthfeel is not what it should be, and this is a style that depends more than most on the texture of the beer. It is lacking in both carbonation and dryness, which makes both the malt and yeast seem bulky and dense. This weighs down the finish of the beer and really hurts the drinkability, while it also makes the flavors seem more muddy and thick than they really are.

Flavor profile is not overly complex, but there a nice mix of dark fruits, a hint of rum and chocolate, booziness, apples and light bitterness on the finish.

It doesn't quite fulfill my notion of a Dubbel, but it's been awhile since my last. The beer is very sweet with a malt flavor that could almost work in a barleywine. It packs a lot of fruit flavors, including plums, grapes and overripe peaches. It's a very nice Belgian yeast strain for an American brewery with good phenols. The beer is right on the edge of booziness, but the balanced sweetness keeps it from going too far. Before tasting the beer, I was trying to maintain some skepticism in spite of my great enjoyment of the BCS.

Appearance is a semi-translucent dark coppery brown color with a thin cap of light brown foam that slowly gave way to a moderate ring of lacing. There are are literally hundreds of miniscule chunks of yeast from the bottle suspended in this brew, the appearance is truly unique. The aroma opens with sweet, dark fruit aromas, then fades and sours slightly to reveal the undertones of caramel and sugary-sweet malt. The taste also starts with a huge sugary sweetness, then brings on more of the same dark fruit characteristics following through from the aroma, touches of vanilla with slight hints of alchohol shining through. Aftertaste leaves a light drying effect, with a hint of an oak-barrel flavor. Mouthfeel is velvety-smooth, medium bodied with low carbonation, this washes down with a silken touch that lightly coats the mouth and throat. Drinkability is nothing short of phenomenal, this Dubbel hides its' moderate abv% well and is super smooth and easy drinking with just enough depth that it can be enjoyed without becoming too complicated.

Super sweet, and tones of fruit. Dark berries and even a hint of citrus in the finish. Mouthfeel was ok, was a little bit syrupy. Drinkability was nice. Overall this was a good beer.

Very tasty dubble. Alcohol warming apparent and welcomed. Good mouthfeel, nice to sip or swig. Drinkable overall, good to start the night off right.

Light lacing. Aromas were of grapes, raisins, clove and a strong cinnamon presence. Tasting this beer after hearing about it for so long was an absolute delight. Sweet raisins were the backbone of the flavors, with a nice blend of the cinnamon and clove makes this an outstanding dubbel. Mouthfeel is nice, very smooth, not heavy at all. Very complex palate. Carbonation is low to mild. I was shocked when I saw that it was 9%, which is pretty high for a dubbel, you don't get that high alcohol taste from this, which is probably due to the aging.

I taste a light glazed donut flavor with a maple sugar glaze like a Vermont pastry. Some woody yeast flavors with an almost kettle corn aftertaste. Mouthfeel is nowhere near a Westy 8, but it does the job. Lacks the silky smoothness in other Dubbels. Some mild carbonation with continuous bubbles rising.

Not much head (not a problem for a sipping beer, in my opinion). The aroma is molasses-y malt, with the alcohol coming through nicely. It has a big sweet fruity malt taste, complex and bordering on decadent. It's reminiscent of a cross between a Belgian Golden Ale and an old ale or some other malty style.

This beer was served in a long-stemmed glass (looked like a wine or martini glass), and it definitely drank more like a really nice spirit than a beer.

Smells of sweet malt, hints of coffee and chocolate, there is tinge of wine or port like smells to the nose with some nice dark fruity esters. Definitely the sort of musty malty smell of a Dubbel. Tastes of both sweet and toasted malt with apple and plum esters, maybe even a tinge of anise. The hop character here is extremely minimal, which is what I'd expect with a Belgian style Dubbel. The longer I sit with this beer the more I like it. For me its not the immediate gratification of one of their other Belgian style reserve batch beers ""Matilda", but is definitely better than their ""Demolition"" ale.

The nose was complex, with notes of malty sweetness, a scent of candied fruits, yeast-driven mustiness, and a hot alcohol burn that tickled my sinuses. The mouthfeel was at once thick, full, and hot. No playing around, here. Coming back to my senses, I note sweet cherry as the dominant flavor. The finish had a combination of the cherry intermingled with a yeasty mustiness.

Very pleasing aroma, a little light, but full of fruit, the alcohol has a brandy vibe to it, somewhat phenolic though. And while the aroma as a little medicinal string in there, the taste is an absolute beauty, an on-spot dubbel interpretation. A cascade of delicious flavors, full of fruits and that sweet brandy alcohol twinge that I really like, a molasses in there, a sweet bit of caramel, and fading sweet aftertaste that really just caps off a delicious brew.

Head retention started off slight, but hung around nicely. Sweet aromas of belgian candy, prunes, cherries, dates, and quite spicy from light hops and alcohol. Tastes quite the same with more emphasis on the malty, candy sweetness and alcohol. Sweetness takes on tacky and sticky proportions and the alcohols lend a light plastic and hot spiciness. Body is moderately heavy with a light oily texture. Finishes quite sweet and dry because of the alcohols. The brew has improved mainly because of it's maturing, and my tolerence for this style of beer. Still wish it had more Belgian yeast esters and muskiness.

Nice aroma!!! Lots of malt and esters. It's composed of toasted, caramel, and Belgian pale malt smells and flavors. Banana and plum. Rising bread. Malt, Malt, Malt. This brew is sure focused on the malt. I love it. A little sugar flavor is in there too. Theres considerable sweetness in his one, mixed with a little alcohol warming. The alcohol doesnt come out in the taste right awayits a slow, creeping warming (very nice!). Moderate carbonation, maybe a little too low for the style. Theres some peppery phenols that become more pronounced as you work through the glass. The smell could be a little more powerful, but this is a well-crafted, complex, delicious brew!","Suds","Dec 30, 2005"

3.98,1.8,4,3.5,4,4,4.5,"Amber is the base color but there are strong influences of peach and gold. Subtle purple highlights. The color is lovely; there is plenty of depth to dazzle the eye. Animation has noticeable in the slight haze and suspended yeast bits. The head was off-white in color, at the apex the foam was almost two fingers in height, it quickly faded to a thin, soapy collar. The liquid is absolutely lovely but the poor head retention is a major bummer. There was no subsequent lacing. If this beer had any sort of head retention and just a little lacing this beer would look perfect. That is how yummy the liquid is! The nose is lively at first. Right out of the bottle there is a big alcoholic blast with a complex array of dark fruits and licorice. However once the beer reaches the glass it lost much of its luster. That sucks. Now the nose is heavy on prunes with candied sugar influences. Spicy. Neutral maltiness, okay, there is some toffee and cola. Grapes. Orange peel. The bouquet is okay on the whole. It doesnt say as much as Id like. The invitation is whispered by the end, where did the primal scream go? The palate is flavorful. Is this the most complex Dubbel Ive ever quaffed? No. There is a cleanliness about it that says American. I get the same vibe from New Belgium. It isnt a bad thing; it is just hard for me to elevate the beer to a higher status. Upfront is a spicy jolt that is quickly backed up by some prunes and grapes with some orange zest. Candied sugar. Toffee. Cola. In the middle is a suggestion of burnt caramel and alcohol heat that blends with some kisses of ginger and cinnamon. The finish has a slight kiss of medical flavors (this alone makes me rethink my comment about this beer being too clean. I guess it is not too clean, it just isnt dirty enough for me until the finish). I hope that makes sense. There is a sugary aftertaste with some sticky, alcoholic residue. So, on the whole, the palate is very tasty. I dont find this beer to be amazing. I do find it to be very enjoyable. IMO, it is too costly to buy regularly (not like I can buy it in Nebraska anyway). It is better than NB Abbey. Medium in body, the carbonation is moderately low, it is very natural on the tongue. The mouthfeel is relaxing and pleasant. It fits this beer very well. Damn this beer. I purchased a 4-pack in Milwaukee, WI for $8. The first three bottles didnt really wow me. Maybe I didnt have my beer thinking cap on. Maybe I drank them too cold. Maybe I was just stupid. Whatever the reason, I wasnt impressed with this beer. I put off reviewing it because I thought it was ho-hum. I will eat my thoughts. This beer is pretty darn good. There is just something about it that tickles my fancy. It is clearly Belgian. It is obviously flavorful. It has a lovely mouthfeel and it is damn fun to drink. Im happy I enjoyed this bottle. I guess I will have to buy more in the future. Worth a try.","bditty187","Jan 15, 2005"

The creamy head soon vanishes into the opaque depths of this beauty after the first sip, swirling away likea mini Milky Way. Taste has a sharp bite of alcohol in the foreground, that mellows and smooths as the beer warms. Eases on into a hint of spice and the sweetness of cotton candy, caramel, apple crisp, and boozey pear. I was quite unprepared for the complexity of this one.

3.97,1.5,3.5,4,4,4,4,"This beer poured a cloudy reddish amber color and formed a small bubbly light tan head that left circular lace as it subsided. A small amount of carbonation is present. An aroma of malt, caramel, raisin and banana. The flavor was of malt, caramel and candy with a hint of the alcohol in the background. The finish is light, with a sweet, buttery aspect to the finish with a warming feel of the alcohol.","Wildman","Jul 28, 2004"

3.95,1,3.5,3.5,4,4,4.5,"Pours a bit on the hazy side, and it is an amber color. It is fairly well carbonated, and shows a tan head when roused. I get aromas of alcohol, cherries, and malt. As I smell deeper the dominant alcohol in the nose begins to die down and more of the fruitiness (raisin and fig, but the cherries certainly dominate) is able to peek out. The taste is fruity up front and finishes with a slight bit of spiciness. There is quite a bit of sweetness left in this beer, it adds to the richness and picks up the fruit notes that are found in this beer. This is pretty enjoyable and would probably age quite well.","Gueuzedude","Jul 17, 2004"

3.68,-5.9,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"smells of plums, caramel, and a slight tinge of alcohol. I really dont know how to describe the taste on this one. It is sweet, tasting as it smells, fruity, some alcoholic esters. This beer reminds me all to much of Sprecher Abbey Tripple. Overall a decent offering from goose island, the second of theirs I have tried behind honkers.","bnuttz","Jul 07, 2004"

4.2,7.4,4,4,4.5,4,4,"There aren't any quirks here but, it is very well made and worth having more. It's good to find another beer made in the USA that has the strength and quality of its Belgian inspiration.","faernt","Jun 20, 2004"
4.1,4.9,4,4,4,4,4.5,"Overall a very nice, relaxing, warming beer. Complexity is intermediate, and the beer is pretty well balanced. The sugar comes on pretty strong, but that is typical for the style. It does stick around in the aftertaste a bit more than I'd like, but it isn't bad. The medicinal flavor isn't really an off flavor, but more an interaction of the alcohol characteristics with the spice of the yeast.","studentofbeer","Jun 14, 2004"

3.92,0.3,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"The beer after departing the 12 ounce brown bottle sets in the glass a hazy burnished copper with the head portly in size and a winsome light tan color, frothy in texture an as it dissolves the lace forms a thin sheet to cling to the glass. The aroma of banana, sweet malt seem to dominate with a slight hint of fusel alcohol to round it out, start is sweet and thick in malt, the top middling in its feel to the palate. Finish has an authoritarian acidic bite, the hops mild with the aftertaste vinous and extremely dry, the high ABV gives a warming to the tummy, a drinkable tis true.","Gusler","Jun 09, 2004"
4.32,10.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"This is one of those beers where, after you ponder the first sip for a moment, you think to yourself ""this is a really nice beer."" Poured a very hazy walnut tinged with ruby. Aroma was bright with banana, calling to mind a good German hefe. Well moderated yeast flavors, with the banana once again evident, but not in excess. Malty, with just enough sweetness to balance nicely. Alcohol was slightly evident as a bit of white pepper. I'm not going to worry about how true this beer is to an ""authentic"" Abbey Dubbel, because I like this more than most of the ""authentic"" products I've sampled. An excellent effort on Goose Island's part.","Brent","May 25, 2004"

4,2.3,4,4,4,4,4,"So it's not picture perfect. Like a pretty woman with one, humanizing flaw, the many strengths outweight the one misstep. The solid malt backbone and earthy fruit tones keep it basic, but never boringly simple. Each sip augers well for the next. Yes, the ABV makes a serious play, but it doesn't seem to try too hard to lay you low, so it remains drinkably pleasant. My thanks to Jahred for this one, because now I know, if I see it again, I'll have it gladly.","Foxman","Beers"
4.24,8.4,3,4,4.5,4,4.5,"As for the mouthfeel, it was thick and syrupy, with plenty of carbonation tingling my tongue. This beer was a winner - let's hope Goose Island continues to bottle some of their more extreme beers.","jahred","0"

4.72,20.7,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,5,"Bottle @ Goose Island Clybourne: This wasn't on the menu, but after talking with the waitress she had some other beer options and this was one of them. It was served in a wine goblet. The beer pours a cloudy reddish-brown. There was some head from a fast pour, but it was gone fairly rapidly. There was a big, sweet nose: yeasty, bread, some floral, some fruits with plums and raisins being most evident. The taste was initially sweet, with a slightly sour aftertaste. Some fruits and caramel to the taste. This made the traffic jam that I sat in to get there worthwhile!","Boto","Beers"
