"Mahogany brown in color with a moderate amount of carbonation bubbles.  A fingernail of khaki head surrounds the rim and forms a circle in the middle of the chalice.  Aroma is of dates, chestnuts, and dark candy sugar.  The taste is dark malt and dark candy sugar.  The mouth is moderately carbonated and that in turn prickles your tongue, it is also dry and warming to your throat."

"Outstanding dubbel, I don't care if I was star struck by the Name. I loved it."

"O - This was a pretty old bottle in review."

"Can you say plum. 2012 bottle. Very smooth. Subtle carbonation. Very tasty. Sweet but not as cloying as other quads. Wish I had more."

"Overall - Not a style I love, but it's really well made."

"This is outstanding. The more I drink this and Westy 12 I am convinced that they reign along with Rochefort in the trappist ale category. As well as the belgian dark category in general. Beer brewed with passion, get some."

"Drank along side 6 other dubbels in a blind tasting. Finished top 3, but not overall favorite of the group. Tied with rochefort 6"
""
""
"Very warm, alcoholic, malty beginning with plums and raisins. Fitting carbonation, helping the beer from becoming too heavy. Malt, in comparison to other Brunes, isn’t too sweet, gets mixed up with an enjoyable, spicy bitterness. Earthy, bready and warm malts define this beer, wrapped up in honey, as the beer warms up. Great balance, decent complexity, smooth mouthfeel, medium body."

"Bottle purchased in Bruges and poured safely back home in Florida. Pours murky dark brownish purple with a massive light khaki head that sticks around. Aroma is dry funky barnyard yeast, surprisingly grassy, light spices, with low sweetness on the nose but for some raisins and figs. Flavor begins with a punch of sweet figs and pears and raisins balanced by a crisp grassy hop finish. Plenty of dry barnyard funk here from the yeast. Medium bodied but lightened up considerably by the high carbonation, crisp, with a dry finish. Definitely lighter than its 12 counterpart. Overall a very nice brew but maybe not quite living up to the considerable price tag. Worth trying, but don't kill yourself over it."

"Bold and firm, this mohoganny brew shows tremendous complexity and focus, with a warming full body supporting notes of raisins, caramel, grape, chocolate, coffee, fruit, yeast and God knows what else - No joke intended. The finish is long and expressive and overall the beer is abound with stand out features."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Edit: Tried it again at Abbey St. Sixtus along with the 12 and the Blonde and this was my favorite of the three. Definitely better this time around. Loved it."

"One of the best aromas on a dubbel I've ever had, but not one I'd make a particular effort to seek out, and didn't love nearly as much as the quad or the pale."

""

""

"O- Easily the best dubbel I've had. Very complex in both the nose and palate, with a very good mouthfeel. Reminds me a lot of Westvleteren 12 in its flavour profile, but quite a bit more drinkable."
""
""
""
""
"Overall- Really good beer that is one of the best in its style but just doesn't quite have what it takes to be one of the great ones. I don't even really understand this beer's placement in the top 250. But I also wasn't terribly impressed with 12 either. I'm sure some of it's the hype and some of it's differing taste buds. But if you have the money to blow, I would say give this a try. At least you'll be able to say you did."

"Verdict: A masterful take on the dubbel and perhaps the best in show for that style, hard to find another contender this complex and well rounded. The balance is spot on and the depth and complexity of the flavors is inspired. The monks certainly know how to make a fine ale."
""
""
""
"O - Not quite as complex or intricate as the quad, but this is certainly the best dubbel I have tried. Very tasty, even being this fresh."
""

"Great Beer. Whoa! This beer here. I made a bad decision on drinking this beer after pounding down some St. Bernardis and Tripel. This beer has an intense taste. Strong as heck. This beer definitely leaves a lingering taste in your mouth. Cheerston this beer. Take your time with this one."

"12oz bottle. Pours a murky amber, topped with a thin yet bubbly tan head. This retains with some light ringing that leaves back a smattering of spotty lace down the sides of the glass. The aroma smells of ripe fruit, spice and sweet sugars. A smidge of light alcohol, roast and some darker fruit character add some edge to the nose as well. The taste pretty much mirrors the aroma, with a rich and flavorful mix of tropical and dark fruits, toffee and brown sugar. Spice works itself into the profile effortlessly, giving things a zesty edge that lingers on the tongue. The mouthfeel is medium bodied, with a soft crispness to the carbonation. Just a touch of alcohol heft sits underneath but overall, this is extremely smooth in the mouth for an 8% beer. This is a really impeccable Dubbel, with a richness and smoothness to the flavors, which just knocks it out of the park. Fantastic beer!"

"This is certainly a well-made, solid and dry beer. I'd go so far as to say it's easily one of the best BSDAs I've ever had. Not sure it quite deserves the hype in relation to beers of certain other styles however. If/when I drink future Westys I will try to get them with more age on them, as that is supposed to improve them substantially."
""
""
""
"Deep chestnut brown; a bit murky. Aromas of sweet malts, fruity yeast, brown sugar and dark fruit -particularly raisin. The taste mirrors the aroma with some brightness in the malt from the creamy carbonation. The mouthfeel is excellent with an oily viscous feel. The only mark against this beer is some slight solvent alcohol flavor on the finish."

""
""
""
"I had an open mind, and was maybe expecting the hype train to be in full swing, but was pleasantly surpised to find that everything folks say about Westy is true. Top stuff."
""
""
"pour is simply beautiful. the taste has to be as close to perfection as I have had, although I readily admit I rate most beers higher than others (it's all good, right?). I love how the brew is light and fluid yet firm enough to hold the still floating sediment on the top thin layer. i'm not intimidated by the degree of difficulty in obtaining this brew, or at least not reflecting it in the rating. I believe this is a great specimen and I wish there were more available."

"whale status from drlovemd87, this has been a long time want. i have to say, i was more impressed by this than by the 12. not that its that much better or anything, but in the context of all quads, westy 12 was excellent but has beers. in the context of all dubbels, westy 8 stands alone at the top in my mind, in terms of quality. hazy amber color to this, dull looking really, with a fizzy off white head, not really all that impressive to look at. the nose on this is great though, its just exuding a wonderful belgian yeast strain that i can say has no equal. in combination with a sweeter malt profile, gentle candy sugar, and raisin type fruitiness, i can say that this is one incredible aromatic profile. the taste is just like the nose, very straightforward. what i like the most about this is its simplicity. not that the flavors are not complex, but this is brewing art it its purist. clean flavors, i taste the grain, i taste the sugar, burnt caramel like is how it comes through, and i taste the yeast, which may be my favorite strain going. the finish is sweet indeed, but its a pleasurable sweet and one that feels right in the mouth. expressive mouth feel, very lively and bright for the style, not weighed down by either its sugars or its alcohol strength. a really splendid beer, yeast forward, and perfectly executed. this is the standard for the style, hands down. i should also mention that i had the esteemed privilege to drink all three of these beers in one session, and the 8 was the pick for me. i am truly blessed."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Well, its a great pleasure again to drink and review this beer, in particular on xmas day. Still one of my favourite beers and although I believe it is inferior to the 12 it i s still a great complex and delicious beer to consume. Highly recommend"
""
"Excellent, but not head and shoulders above others in the style as the scores would suggest. With the robust maltiness and restrained sweetness, I find that Westy 8 is quite similar to Ommegang Abbey Ale."
""
""
""
""
""
"M: Medium bodied."
""
""
"O: I don’t smoke but could see a cigar pairing well with this beer. I think it’s the overall composition with the mouthfeel, head retention, scent and taste that make this beer one of the world’s most sought after beers. I went to In De Verde and picked up a case of 6 less than 2 weeks ago. Love it, refined classic brew that will keep you sipping."
""
""
""
""
""
"Expectations were high, but this beer was higher even. Definitely the best dubbel i've ever had. Too bad it's hard (and expensive) to find."
""
""
""
""
""
"I am sure this is a great beer just not my style and I also tried it both times pretty young. I bet I would like it a lot more with some age on it. It was fun to chase down but I will probably never do it again. This is one of those beers where I think the hype is bigger and better then the beer itself. Again I think it was made stylistically correct just not my cup of tea."

"Anyone needs to experince Sint Sixtusabdijs. And the dubbel 8% is worth the trip."
"Beer is medium weight in body, with medium-high carbonation levels. Prickly as it moves across the palete, but fairly quickly becoming foamy and smooth on the palate. Closes dryly, with light stickiness on the palate."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A very good beer. The flavors are a bit more like a small quad than that of a large dubbel. The dryness took me by surprise. A great Belgian, but its much better on draft at the source."
""
""
"OV: A very tasty brew that I'm glad I purchased and got to try. The flavours, while nothing really jumps out at me, are very well balanced and blend nicely together. It goes down very easy for an 8%er. A really good sipper."

"Overall pretty nice. Maybe better than westy 12 but not sure. Tasty beer aside from the oxidation which is very light on the flavor. I'm impressed how it gets the sweet characters but not syrupy at all."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured out as a deep amber brown color with a quick fading tan head on top. There isn't much retention or lacing at all. The smell of the beer give off some Belgian spice notes with some cherry and vanilla in the mix. The taste of the beer is bready, spicy slightly sweet and earthy. The mouthfeel is very well carbonated and has a slight booziness in the finish. Overall it's a very good beer but it's nothing overly special. I believe the challenge of getting these beers adds to the hype which reflects the initial score of them. It's good just not as good as the score on here shows."
""
"O-This is a very good dubbel. The looks, in particular, are a example for others to follow. The nose is a bit too aggressive for me, but the flavor is pretty solid. Interestingly, this beer is much less sweet and more peppery than the XII."
""
""
""
""
"O - Overall I was happily impressed by this beer. Very glad to have tried it !"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This is easily the best Dubbel that I have ever drank. Its just wonderful. Benchmark for the beer style. Westy 8 is as good as they say it is!!!"
""
""
""
""
"I've had dubbels which I've enjoyed a lot. Westvleteren just topped that list with its own. With its combination of great taste and drinkability, this was my favorite of the Westvleteren family."

"At the Cafe de Verve, time to move on from the blond and move up one step to the dubbel. This beer is dark brown, cloudy appearance with medium sized and amount of CO2 bubbles. Roasted malt flavor with an alcohol end note. Notes of chocolate and coffee present, missing the dark ripe estery fruits normally found in dubbels. The mouthfeel is quite nice, creamy and heavy with a nice smoothness and drinkable. This beer ends with a dark roasted malt quality with a hint of spiciness-more hoppy than yeasty."
""
""
"Pours a dark brown copper colour with a big creamy off white head with great retention. Strong aroma of dried fruit mostly plum also a bit of caramel and tobacco notes. flavour is very smooth low carbonation light dried fruit with a nice sweetness and well balanced bitterness. also the alcohol is barely noticeable. excellent beer"
"I have a Westy 12 in my refrigerator and I have never had that one. absolutely ecstatic to try. Will be reviewing that beer shortly thanks for the read."
""
""
""
""
"O: Superb complexity that develops in the glass, and highly drinkable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
" I prefer the 8 to the 12 purely on my own palate. Both are truly fantastic beers."
""
""

"Overall: Really good beer, but doesn't live up to the hype in my opinion. Considering the great effort or cost that goes into obtaining this, I'll be sticking to more readily available options in the future."
""
"O: An incredibly special beer. Incredibly. I wasn't blown away with the Blonde. Actually disappointed, which made me skeptical about how this one would be. But this one lives up to it's fetishized name. With that said, I'm not jumping up and down saying, this is the most delicious beer I've ever had. Dubbels are not my style. But this one is the holy grail of Dubbels. Magical. It was worth the 10 euros I paid for it (please dont bash me!)."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I thought I'd missed the point with the Westy 12 but now I've been similarly underwhelmed by the 8. If my bottle was a typical example of a two year old bottle then it tastes very ordinary with a bit of age. I'd love to try a fresh one because all these people can't be wrong."
""
""
"Pours a murky dark brown with a foamy khaki head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace slowly drip into the remaining beer on the drink down either. Smell is of malt, brown sugar, grape juice, and lots of dark fruit aromas. Taste is much the same with a fruity flavor on the finish. There is a mild amount of spice bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good beer with a great smell and some really tasty flavors."
""
"O) A very nice treat on my birthday, so thanks for the bottle Dad. Met my expectations and definitely worth acquiring. Look forward to trying the Westy 12 some day."
""
"O: Very balanced and surprisingly easy to drink. An excellent beer but it lacks the big WOW that would make it a true titan among giants."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Bottle courtesy of totoropanda. Thanks Daniel. Pours a dark amber with small tan head that has decent retention and leaves a good amount of lacing on the glass. The aroma is fruity with raisin and plum, some caramel, and some light oxidation. The taste is mildly sweet with raisin plum, and a bit of caramel. The finish is slightly dry with a light bitterness. Medium body. Medium-low carbonation. Good. Like a slightly toned down version of Westy 12."

""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Extraordinary, one of the best belgian beer I have laid my hands on. I thought that all of the westy beers were just hype machines, but this is just magnificent, I cannot imagine that Westy 12 is any better."
"Dark mahogany color, with a small tan head that retained as a thin layer, and left a little lacing on the glass. Absolutely loved the aroma on this. Rich scents of sweet raisins, figs, caramel malts, brown sugar, Belgian yeast. Super smooth. I almost want to give it a 5.0. The taste reflects the nose, dried dark fruits, mingled with smooth malt sweetness, dark sugars, a touch of cocoa, and a mellow but ubiquitous booziness throughout the session. Smooth mouthfeel, medium body, moderate carbonation. Complex and well-crafted."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Overall, this is an outstanding beer. No flaws. Every aspect is appealing. If I had a wish, it would be for a bit more body and complexity, but now I'm splitting hairs."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - A wonderful beer in a wonderful location"
""
"I'll have to call it a tie for now with Prior 8."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - I've wanted to try this beer for a long time so it could easily have been a letdown. But it was worth the wait. This is a wonderful hand crafted work of art."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The body was crisp, full and smooth. Drinkability was excellent, this would be the rare beer where I would want a large format bottle all to myself. Overall, a great beer. Worth whatever it takes to get your hands on."
""
""
""
"Overall, just terrific. Truly a remarkable beer. Definitely lives up to expectations. I basically assumed the beer would be good but a bit of a letdown, and it was not in the slightest!"

"Cost: $12 for a 11.2 oz bottle."
"Poured from bottle into Westvleteren Glass at the Abbey cafe on 9/8/12 - not sure when bottled or any of that. Pours a deep chocolate brownie looking brown, with slight tan rim. Superb fruity yeast aromas. Taste is really just amazing...chocolatey, dried fruit and some spice/vanilla maybe. Super smooth and just all around amazing. Although the Abbey was so over commercialized, its still worth the visit to try them at the source. Obviously, go out of your way for this...because there really isnt any other choice!"

"This is a wonderfully balanced and drinkable beer. I am glad I finally cracked my bottle."

""
""
""
""
""
"O - Not quite as complex or intricate as the quad, but this is certainly the best dubbel I have tried. Very tasty, even being this fresh."
""
""
""
""
"O: It lives up to the Westvleteren name, however I do not feel it is worth the effort required to seek out in the US."
""
"Overall my first Westy did not disappoint! I think this is the best dubbel I have had."
"Perhaps this beer is not quite as drinkable as the Blonde, but considering the increased alcohol content, it is still fantastically drinkable. The flavor profile really is so totally different it's a toss up which is better, but the deep color and, unquestionably, the fantastic aroma, set this beer apart."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A fantastic dubbel."
""
""
""
""
"O: The best dubbel I have had to date, and I don't imagine I will find one I like more. Great flavor profile and mouthfeel."
"Overall - Not usually a Belgian beer fan but this is a unique beer that is powerful without the malty sweetness one would expect from a higher ABV. Full flavored and good for sipping!"
"Fantastic."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The body is medium with good carbonation. A little bit sticky. Overall this one is pretty well done and incredibly drinkable."
"This is medium to full bodied, with a lively mouthfeel. Awesome stuff. Much better than Rochefort in my mind."
"o - one of the more flavorful dubbels i've had. the sweetness balances out the dark fruit and heat really rounding this one out immensely. i'll have to have my next one of these next to a westy 12 since i can't remember enjoying the 12 as much as this beer. this beer is amazing...one of the better beers i have ever tried. i was simply blown away by this beer."
""
"Rich and complex taste, though not game-changing like Westy 12. Finishes dry with malt and spices. Improves as it warms. Good, but can't touch Westy 12."
""
""
""
"Arrives at the table with a dense tan head. The beer is a very dark brown (but definitely not black). There are aromas of figs and dates and a noticeable alcohol presence. On the tongue there's an explosion of chocolate and a slight bit of raisin. There's moderate alcohol bites, although the light body belies the strength of the beer. Very smooth and creamy. This was hands-down our favorite of the three Westy beers."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: It's a good abbey beer, to be sure. But is it considerably better than something like a Westmalle dubble? I doubt it. The Westvleteren 12 is too strong and not much more complex, though, so I think it's the best of the (overrated) bunch."
""
"O: Overall, what a fantastic beer.  Hands down the best Dubbel I've ever had, and it's not even close.  Honestly, drinks like a quad, and a great one.  Flavors and aromas are a little toned down compared to the Westy 12, but I guess that's the point of a Dubbel. No doubt the epitome of the style. World Class."
"Not your average Abbey Dubbel. Darker fruits than in other doubles, no muddled flavors. Westy 8 is drinkable, thankfully balanced, and has a clean finish. The aromas have both the usual brighter notes of citrus, as well as the darker cherries and figs. A complex blend that tastes as good as it smells. Not my favorite overall style, but usually I pour them out, and this one I quaffed with enjoyment. Thanks to Chris for hooking it up around this time last year!"
"O - A true delight. I really tried to savor this one as long as I could."
""
""
"O - A great beer that I'm glad I had the opportunity to try. Just like the 12 this is worth the hype and price to try this special beer."
""
""
"Got this in a trade from England. Pours a murky brown with a light brown foamy head. Aroma is huge and delicious. Heavy, rich malts with vanilla and dark sweet fruit. Sweet flavor that ends with light bitterness. Very drinkable for a high abv. Perfectly balanced throughout. All-around fantastic beer."
"I love this beer, and would drink it if it werent so freaking expensive."
"Note: 2 to 4 year aging of this beer is optimal..."
""
"O - In short, this is one of the most delicate, well refined brews I have ever had. I was unaware that a Dubbel could carry such a taste, and I aspire to make a trip to Belgium soon!"
""
""
""
"Drinkability: It's a smooth drinkable beer accompanied with great complex flavors and aromas."
""
""
""
"O- Not quite as amazing as I had expected, but that is a common problem with these types of beers- they tend to be a bit over-hyped. I may have had a bad bottle, but this just didn't blow my hair back like I expected."
""
""
""
""
""
"O. Good. Much prefer the quad (12) but this aint half bad. Didnt like some of the vegetal flavors, but for the most part this was a good one."
"Overall, awesome. I wouldn't mind trying it younger, as it's a little less boozy than I would usually age, but it certainly held up fine."

"4.5 D: A couple categories could have been a touch higher, so 4.5 here. This is a lot like the 12. Super well integrated, subtle, and infinitely clean. But, unlike the 12, this is perhaps a bit too subtle and you really have to concentrate to enjoy it. Still, good beer."
""
""
"Notes: What a treat, and what a surprise, the last of the excellent Westvleteren brews to try was quite the special animal. Almost like a combination of the best of the blonde and the 10 but with its own character. The sense of balance and change of rhythm in the palate without losing a touch of its structure is something to remember…"

"Overall this is a great beer. It's very flavorful and fruity and has a clean finish. Is its the best in the world? I don't know but what i do know is that I was glad to have tried it but would not trade my cellar for it."

"Purchased from Tanakaya in Mejiro, Tokyo. Poured into an also newly purchased Trappistes Rochefort wide-rimmed goblet. I can't even begin to describe this wonderful brew in words that conform to a language I speak. A lovely caramel-colored head covered the black-brown brew from beginning to end, releasing all of the magical scents that again escape known words. I drank it, and it warmed my soul. Then, I drank more and it made me smile. I continued to drink and continued to grow more and more in love with it. If you have the chance (and the money) to buy this beer, do not pass on it. It is worth the search and the cash."

"Overall one of the best dubbels I've ever had. A serving size of only 330cl leaves you wanting another."

"Bottle at In de Vrede. It pours murky dark brown, with a thick fluffy beige head and soft carbonation. The nose is caramel, toffee, fig, date, liquorice, menthol and salt. The taste is very smooth and full of dark fruit: fig, date, prune and plum. As well as: wood, caramel, vanilla, mint, bread, charcoal, toast, liquorice, toasted sesame and coffee, with a very long roasted-bitter finish. It tastes fresh, complex and is very well balanced, but still very drinkable. It deserves its place at the top."

""
""
"Would love to compare it with a 'fresh' example!"
""
""
""
"O: I can't believe it, but I think I might like the 8 more than the 12. Awesome malt/caramel complexity with the belgian yeast/bready aspect. Again, one of the top five beers I have ever had. A treat to try and I consider myself extremely lucky to have some great beer buddies and the chance to have tried this."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: An absolute treat for sure. I'm quite surprised just how much more depth there is to the taste than the nose lets on. I was expecting a grape/phenol bomb but was absolutely blown away by the malt depth, balance, and smoothness. This is one of the best Belgians I have ever had and would greatly recommend the Westy 8. Now I just need to see how a fresh bottle compares to this matured (nearly 4 year old bottle) bottle."
""
"Overall: This is hands down the best beer that has ever passed through these delicious lips of mine. If I could only drink this beer for the rest of my life I would be content and die a very happy man. Perfection in a glass"
""

""
""
"Extremely creamy feel, medium bodied, fine carbonation. Some oxidation notes, rather bitter and oddly metallic. Some nutty malt flavors linger, bitter walnut and grassy herbs. Taste seems a bit of a letdown from what I remember years ago. Very dry and attenuated, with an overt alcohol presence. Probably won't seek out again unless it's known to be very fresh."

"O. One of the best dubbels I have had. Really not all that different in smell, taste, and mouthfeel than a lot of quads. Not as flavorful or as much mouthfeel as 12 but this is an excellent beer. Westvleteren makes 3 very excellent beers, I am glad I have had the opportunity to try all 3."

"Edit...enjoying my second bottle almost a year later. The smell has intensified. Still the same scents, only they're stronger and work together better. The taste is the same only everything has meshed, along with a bit of alcohol making more of an appearance. It's without question my favorite beer in the world."

"I’m not a huge fan of dubbels so I wasn’t too excited to drink this even though it’s a Westvleteren. Needless to say it blew me away."

"Creamy, but well carbonated leading to a great sipper. I love it when these relatively heavy beers are carbonated like this. Forces you to enjoy it slowly, like a great meal. Top notch dubbel which sadly is mostly unavailable to me."

"Overall this is a perfect example of what a Belgian Dubbel should be. It took all of my effort to not devour my half-a-glass because I really wanted to enjoy this. Is it worth the price tag, probably not. It is amazing, definitely. I have been trying to track one down for a while and when it if offered to you for free, you say F-Yes! Recommended and definitely worth tracking down as long as you don't break the bank or trade the cellar for it."

"Pours a dark amber/brown color w/ a beautiful two finger cocoa head. Fantastic lacing on my tulip glass, and it sticks around until I wash the glass. Fantastic for the style. Nose consists of caramel, raisin, figs, cinnamon, spice, other fruits, and yeast. Super complex nose, and constantly improving and changing. By the time this beer is fully warmed, the nose gets bumped from a 4.5 to a 5. The taste... Words can't describe the taste. It's constantly changing, swirling in a cauldron of awesomeness. The profile is similar to the nose, w/ some fresh baked bread in there for good measure. I can't think of a single thing to improve here- thus the perfect score. Feel is super silky and smooth, with different amazing things happening to your mouth as you experience this brew. Full bodied, and perfect. Overall, I was blown away by this beer. Major props to BA Huhzubendah for sharing it w/ me. Cheers!"
"Found this at a bar in Brugges. I was excited to try it. It poured very nicely into a chalice. There was not much head, but the color was a beautiful brown, cloudy, with particles in it. It smelled sweet; plum, sugar and faint alcohol. The taste is excellent, very sweet but complex, fruit and sugar with slight bitterness. The mouthfeel was surprisingly crisp. That said it was not thin. I actually preferred this to the 12. One of the best beers I have ever had. Try it if you get a chance."
"Drinkability. Very nice and the best I've tried of the style. Lots going on in here and it all works well together. Glad to have tried this."
"O: A very good beer. Marked with its Trappist seal. Something between a blue Chimay and a Rochefort 10. Love it !"
"Honoured to be able to try this beer. Great."
"O- 12 and 6 were fantastic, 8 is well done; but its not as good as I was expecting. It reminds me of the Rochefort lineup."
"Unique, complex and deeelicious."
"O: Hands down best dubbel out there that I have had. Glad I hauled this back with me as a single bottle from Amsterdam."
"D: Masterfully crafted and delicious. I really doubt I'll ever taste another dubbel this good. Obviously not the easiest beer to get, but it does not disappoint."
"Nice finish, nothing gets in the way of another sip. Superb"
"Rich, deep and very, very enjoyable, my sweet tooth just loves this, I thought the Westmalle Dubbel was superb, but this knocks socks off it in all departments, a wonderful beer from start to finish."
"O - absolutely world class. i think what pushed my rating here to exceptional was just how unbelievably drinkable this beer is. go find it."
"Just shared a bottle to celebrate a friend's wife's pregnancy. This bottle was from my honeymoon three years ago so it had a good amount of aging. It is still one of my favorite beers. The smell is like heaven and so is the taste. I just wish I had more."
"O: Insanely drinkable, delicious, balanced. Phenomenal."
"A fantastic dubbel, one of the best I've ever drank. If I lived in Belgium I'd have these in the fridge non-stop."
"Overall, this is by far my favorite dubbel. I haven't had many that didn't leave a lot of banana aftertaste. This one doesn't...and that's why I love it. Glad I have 2 more saved up for other special occasions. Truly an amazing beer."
"Not quite as funky and sour as Westy 12, but also not as flavorful. Drinkability is slightly higher, but quality is slightly lower."
"I'm wowed. I didn't know what to expect, deliberately didn't read any reviews before tasting. I'm not a big dubbel drinker but this one is definitely worth repeating if I get the opportunity."
"Overall: A very good Dubbel, but didn't quite live up to my expectations, which were admittedly high. The cherry notes were very pleasant and everything blended together quite nicely."
"4.5, 4, 3.5, 4, 4"
"Overall impressive palate more than anything else. Neat even though this is not a favorite style of mine in general. These guys know what they are doing, just don't ask me how?!"
"O – A very good double, very good indeed. It just gets better after each gulp you take."
"d - very drinkable, a bit sweet and pruny, but dry ale yeast and peppery notes balance it out"
"O- Word class. One of the more pleasent beer experiences I've had. So drinkable, worth the reputation."
"O – I was expecting a lot here and thought it would disappoint. It did the opposite. This is a delicious dubbel, the best of I have had to date. Ridiculously drinkable even at the ABV. Now to get more…."
"Pours foggy,deep amber in color with rubi hues to the light.Creamy,close & lasting froth,beige in color.An incredible all around lacing bed created by small & concentraded bubbles. Bread yeast & caramel malt aromas, prune aromas.Subtle fresh flavor hints followed by anisette notes round nose feeling.Sweet bitter at fist sip. Slightly toffee flavor wraps a medium body.Palate is fulled up by raisin & molasses. Gentle carbonation. ABV is so well camouflated that only a kindly brandy flavor reveals alcohol presence. A perfect balanced beer. Excelent drinkability. Comments: One of the best prey I´ve catched in my more than 35 years as a beer hunter.Pairing:Nothing at all. An amazing experience should not be cloudy by anything.Nevertheless if you´re lucky enough to have more than one of this, fresh bread rolls & banana will match pretty well."
"O: Absolutely delicious dubbel, easily the best that I have had to date. Really drinkable for 8% ABV and every sip is packed with tons of flavor. Wish I had another one."
"Hallelujah."
"O-Best dubbel I've ever had, hands down. As I see it, this is the one to beat. Good luck with that."
"Thanks CaseyK for a chance at this one! Bottle is from 1985 and cap says ""EXTRA 8"" on it. Pours a medium brown with a reddish-orangey tint to it with a very slight head. Nose is a nice collection of dark fruit and caramel breadiness, including big plum. The taste is fantastic - a lot of plum, pear, prune, with a bit of breadiness. Crazy smooth and easy to drink. Very light carbonation with a pretty light body. We speculated whether this was brewed with plum puree. This dubbel held up with no problem at all and just blew us away. The only problem was that I only had a few ozs. Would love another to compare. One of the better beers I've had. In my experience, the Westy 12 wasn't worth the effort relative to other Quads (still good though). This beer, granted it has a ton of age, was totally worth the effort."
"Pours a dark reddish brown with a finger or two of foam in the Maredsous chalice glass. Tastes of bready/biscuit like malts, with a slight dark fruit finish to it. The 8% is masked very well and it drinks down very smooth. Would be nice if Westvleteren beers were more accessable."
"This is an incredible beer. I have one stored away for a good day and I can't wait to drink it with a little age on it."
"Toasty, deep sweetbread with a zesty yeast bite. Not hoppy, but has a drying effect similar to a spiced winter warmer. A unique, bready belgian beer that I would happily buy again were it more readily available. The questability and rarity of the beer is a bit of a turnoff for me though to actively seek out. Thanks again Dan, I really enjoyed it."
"Mouthfeel/Overall: Light mouthfeel....but the carbonation is so fine and so abundant that it results in a pillowy mouthfeel. Very nice. Overall, like I said, the far and away the best dubbel I have ever had. Many dubbels come across as yeast and wet cardboard to me, but this beer does much more than that. Extremely impressive."
"3/25/11. Bottle courtesy joes! Hazy deep brown pour with a small fizzy tan head that’s gone fast. Malty aroma with yeast, caramel, and a hint of mint. Reminds of me of a ligher version of 12... Grapey, yeasty, smooth, caramel, and loveliness. You can tell that these beers are very well made. Nice!"
"Sublime. I'm not going to make any bold statements about this beer's status as the ""best ever"" (I haven't opened the 12 yet!), but rest assured this brew is certainly worthy of the hype and is certainly amongst the very best brews the world can offer. Worth navigating the tricky ordering process (or better yet, a fortuitous trade!) Truly fantastic stuff, and I really wish I had more of this."
"Another cracking Belgian from the little masters, and another beer worthy of seeking out. I was thoughtful I might like this even better than the 12, being as though the Dubbel is a particular favourite of mine, but there's no doubting the superiority of the Quad. This was a stellar beer; the 12 was phenomenal."
"Mouthfeel is medium full and silky smooth. This was a real treat picked up in an early trade with alldaydrinker. I would rate this slightly higher than the Westy 12."
"A fantastic beer, best dubbel to date, no surprise its a westy!!"
"Overall a pretty good beer. I'm not sure if I'll continue to dish out the high dollars for it though. I know of one competitor that is just as good if not better and I can purchase it right off the shelf. Still a pleasure to have."
"jd"
"Thanks to Jason for bringin this along with a Westy 12! Pours a murky brown color with a medium tan-white head that sticks around for a bit. Scent is full of dark fruit with a bit of a sour apple aroma. Not nearly as much going on as the 12 has. Taste initially a tart green apple flavor which is immediately followed with a lot of lovely chocolate flavors. Dark fruits and a bit of spiciness as well. Well balanced. Mouthfeel is very dry, possibly one of the most dry dubbels I've had, which is not a bad thing at all. Drinkability is high. Overall, this is probably the best dubble I've ever had. I do enjoy the Quads and Tripels more, but this is great for what it is. Very tasty beer!"
"O: not the worst dubbel I've had, where it disappoints is in the wrong places."
"Malty, candi sugar and light citrus hops. Raisins, bread and caramel. A light alcohol burn. Mild carbonation, a nice sipper. A very enjoyable beer even with the alcohol burn."
"Pours dark brown with some sediment. The off-white head has great retention, leaves a little lacing. Very fruity aroma with pears, apples & dark fruits, candi sugar, and spices. Smells really nice! Tastes of dark fruit, malt, spices, and earthy hops. Extremely smooth mouthfeel, the carbonation is perfect. Slightly dry. Overall it's a wonderful beer, probably the best dubbel I've tried!"
"Still, it's much better than Westvleteren 12."
"Cheers!"
"Overall: If it was more readily accessible, I would drink this fine beer daily. If you have a chance to buy it, DO IT."
"Dr: I'll pound it all night like it's Megan Fox. Not as good as the 12, but still an amazing beer. I think too often this beer gets compared with the 12 unfavorably, which is so difficult to avoid. Taken out of the shadow of the 12, it's a magnificent beer in its own right. This beer can almost have a tendency to feel like its a step on the staircase towards the 12, but it ought to be considered outside this context, as in terms of the Dubbel style, it's hard to do better. An amazing beer all things considered. Very affordable when purchased at the abbey and not from the douchenozzle ebayers. Obviously its availability is a constraining factor."
"O: Complex and delicious beer all the wy around. World class and phenom dubbel."
"Excellent dubbel - probably the best I've ever had."
"O: I have severely underestimated Westvleteren and I will be sure to seek out as much of this as possible. This one is definitely the benchmark that I will be comparing all dubbels to.. until something else blows me away of course."
"O/D - Good beer. Nice dark fruit flavour mixed with other well represented elements. I think this is the weakest of the Westvleteren beers with the Blonde being my second favourite but this was still very drinkable and very tasty. And like all the other Westy beers, so smooth and extremely easy to drink 3 before you notice you finished 1."
"Definitely my least favorite of the Westy bunch."
"Thanks to my GF, westys for my b-day! Bottle opens and a slight gush occurs, pours reddish brown with an auditory tan head and a shade of lacing. An island of foam remains atop throughout. Strong aroma of raisin, dates, and caramalized candi sugar. A little spice on the nose as well. Chewy, dark candi sugar, big cara malts and dark fruity flavors. Somewhats vinous. Nice estery yeast flavors. Really no hint of the alcohol in this beer. Little bit of nutty quality. Dryer mouthfeel than anticipated but some flavor sticking around. Well this certainly lives up to the hype, well done."
"O - Another mind blowing beer from Westvleteren."
"Overall: Only downside was price. Worth it for the experience."
"Overall - juset a superb beer. I cannot overstate how satisfied i've been with the westvleteren experience tonight. I know overhyping something is the best way to ruin it, but as long as you come to this beer with the proper mindset, you're sure to enjoy them."
"I'd started righting a negative review. Beer was too cold. School girl error. Although it wasnt really THAT cold, this if far better at around 15 degrees C. I think I enjoyed this more drinking in big chewy mouthfulls rather than dainty sips as well."
"D - Drinkability is high. The nose is a little underwhelming but the taste more than compensates. It's a great dubbel, but not as much as a standout as the Westvleteren 12 is for the Quad category."
"If you are lucky enough to get the chance to try it, do not pass it up. A true world class belgian, worthy of its reputation."
"Such a great beer. So full of flavor that it leaves me a little speechless. I would definitely pay another $30 for it again. Highly recommend."
"O - I ca see why people prefer this over its big brother, because its even more gentle and almost as complex. Its just so damn smooth and like the 12 takes you on a journey of flavours."
"Drinkability and Overall Impression: One word to help understand this beer is “complex.” Another is “smooth.” The drinkability is great here. I could sip on this one all night and would hope someday to have more. My overall impression is that this beer deserves its reputation as a well-made dubbel and that it sets the bar to such a height that others may aspire but don’t really achieve."
"O: a very unique, but very good dubbel. Wish it was more available though."
"O: Great stuff that is extremely easy to drink and love."
"All so rich and powerful but still so delicate. This is a beer that nears perfection"
"Overall, i like and see why this brewery is known for their complex beers. I hope i get to try the 12 next time."
"Pours a dark murky reddish brown, not much head at all. Aromas of dried fruits, brown sugar, caramel. Flavor follows with raisins, dates, sweet port, and lots of other delicious notes. Each sip brings all of these to the front of your tastebuds. Its also a very light and crisp Dubbel. VERY drinkible. While not quite as good as the Westy 12, still an outstanding beer."
"The CPJ"
"Excellent beer. I hate comparing, but this is much better than the blonde & pretty damn close to being as good as the 12. Fruity, light, drinkable, & different enough from your run-o-the-mill dubbel to put it at the head of the class. I can see why this is highly sought after."
"An excellent beer. Subtle and complex, but overall flavor did not jump out as exceptional enough to justify the ranking to me. I am new to the Belgian beer scene, but personally, I prefer to buy one of the good North American made Belgian style beers over this."
"Overall, this beer is one of the most interesting trappist beers I've had. It's well balanced but much hoppier than any Belgian beer(in this style) that I have encountered. The malt and dark fruit notes really start to shine as it warms so I highly recommend drinking it at cellar temperature or letting it warm up considerably to enjoy it at it's fullest potential. Not as complex, flavorful or easy to drink as the 12 but it's still pretty good."
"Overall, this is a truly great beer and very unique. It tasted much fruitier and light than I expected. I really appreciate my friend for sharing part of a bottle with me. Truly a great beer drinking experience and I hope to get some for myself in the future."
"M/D. This beer was pretty light on carbonation, but was still really smooth as it finished."
"Poured a dark maroon, opaque with a finger or two of off-white head. Nose of sharp alcohol initially, but then some raisin, ripe green apple skin, ripe plums and some date appears. Taste kicks off with a quick glimpse of the alcohol on the palate, mixed with some stone fruits. Light apple comes through again, hints of brown sugar, vanilla. Alcohol present and prevalent throughout each sip, but only adds to the complexity of this. Light tannic finish. Warming mouthfeel, great body with a finish that lingers forever. Solid drinkability, and an exceptional beer. Best dubbel I've ever had."
"I recieved this in a recent trade, poured into a goblet from an 11.2 ounce bottle. Pours a murky brown, huge 4 finger head, that leaves nice lacing. Dark fruit is primary on the nose, some spices. The flavors of plums, dates and apples meld very nicely, not overly sweet. The beer is very smooth, it has a slightly sweet finish. The body is medium, smooth, well carbonated. A very smooth, easy drinking beer, I can see why it is a classic."
"Big thanks to Brad. Amazingly, a darker pour than the 12, really deep brown, a creamy beige head. Aroma of prunes, figs, some maple syrup. Not really a massive burst of fruits and sugars like the 12. Flavor has that really rich, elegant, clean alcohol sugar purity, fresh and exciting. There are a lot of figs, and a slight bittering component of hops on the back end that isn't necessarily welcome here. A little too much carbonation, but still creamy and smooth. Over-ripe bananas play a role as the beer warms. The comparisons to the 12 are inevitable -- this is less of everything but still delicious."
"The feel is moderate and spritzy. Again, great balance. Sweet on the palate as most Belgians are but the earthy characteristics keep everything in check. ABV well hidden."
"Had this part of a Westvleteren taster at Volo in Toronto. Pours a dark ruby brown with a finger of white head. Really nice head retention. I had this after the taster of the Westy blonde and the head was still there. Lots of lacing on the glass. Smells of plum and cherry with brown sugar and candy sugar. Alcohol is a little bit noticeable in the flavour. Quite sweet flavour, very nice. Very nice mouthfeel. I think this is easily the best dubbel I've ever had."
"O- Home run. Hands down best double I've had... sorry Westmalle. It has all the awesome grain character you want, plus even more amazing things happening. It's just plain delicious. This beer makes me wish they distributed so much more than I did before."
"Pours mahogany with ruby, orange and brown showing up in the light, nice lace on the glass, tight white to off white head. Smells of alcohol, burnt sugar, dark cherry, apple, caramel, raisin, dark fruit, toffee. The nose on this is extremely complex and inviting. Taste is dark fruit, raisin, candy like sugar, apple, a very pronounced sharp warming alcohol is present upfront that pushes this along but isn't overpowering and a tannic presence in the finish. Mouthfeel is solid with a great weight and a subtle but present carbonation, very solid. Drinks really well, starts off as a slow sipper but as it opens up and warms it drinks much quicker, truly excellent stuff."
"Mouthfeel is appropriately viscous but definitely on the lighter side for the style, and there is a pleasant dryness. Westy beers seem a bit more attenuated than some of the other Trappists, and this definitely helps drinkability."
"Pours a hazy brown with orange-ish hints, with a light tan head. In the aroma, dark candi sugar, yeast, dark fruits like candied figs and dates, chocolate, hops, and earth. In the taste, a lot going on at once, candi sugar is obvious, cocoa, toffee, sugarplum, maple, dark chocolate with a slight touch of anise and ginger. Smooth and medium bodied mouthfeel, with a sweet to dry little bit of everything in the aftertaste. It might be the most complex thing I have ever had."
"Drinkability is very good, the flavors were great and it had some nice depth and complexity. The dark fruit flavors really stood out and added some very pleasant sweetness. Very nice beer overall and a great example of the style."
"This bottle was bought in Brussels about a year ago and kept in my cellar."
"Beautiful deep brown, pulled back on the pour for clarity (my preference). Wonderful sweet smell that's hard to pin down. It's just awesome. Tasted slightly sweet with full flavor mix of perfectly combined malt and yeast, again very hard to describe accurately without going too far down any one road. Plum notes show up in the flavor, but don't linger too long. Very nice going down in full-flavored swallows. If there's a downside here, which is hard to find, it might be too sweet to drink all night."
"D: The feel of this one makes it highly drinkable. A little warm towards the end of the beer limits it slightly. Smell was fantastic, with the taste only leaving me wanting slightly more - but I guess that would be a style preference."
"D: Pretty good drinkability, but a lot less interesting than the 12. It was nice to try this, but I won't seek it out again."
"Bottle. Cap has 2.05.13 on the cap, reviewed on 2/2/11. Poured into a tulip glass a clear, deep ruby red brown color with a large fluffy 3 finger light tan head that slowly recedes. Head leaves some nice lace as it settles. The aroma is pretty nice with a subtle dark fruit smell along with some banana. Medium/light mouthfeel with some good carbonation. First taste yields flavors of dark malt, dark fruit, and some alcohol notes. Some lingering bitterness as well. The taste is actually a little more subdued than I thought it would be. The carbonation seems a little high for me as well and detracts from the flavors. Overall, I'm just ok on this beer, it isn't exactly what I thought it would be and isn't as good as I wanted."
"Skal!"
"Best dubbel I've ever had. Hope to have this again."
"Poured a very nice pecan brown. Soft hues of autumn in the light, topped with an off-white head that gave wonderful lacing. I would expect nothing less from the most esteemed Belgian brewery/monastery in the world. Lovely caramel of a darker type, along with figs and bread. Extremely well made, offering caramel, touch of sweet chocolate, dates, figs, and yeast. No alcohol is detected at all. Well carbonated, as it should be, and quite smooth. Maybe too smooth, in fact, because I can't seem to stop pouring more samples for myself...."
"This is a great dubbel that I am lucky to be enjoying on my b-day. The alcohol is not noticeable, and the beer is so delectable and smooth, that you could drink a lot of this, if bottles weren't so hard to get ahold of. This is not just a good tasting beer, but it produces a warm fuzzy bodily feeling that is unusually pleasant as well."
"This beer is an excellent complement to its better known brother and an excellent beer all around, once more deserving of its reputation."
"Quite nice. I would compare this favorably to the other big name dubbels mainly on the strength of better balance and less sweetness in the flavor, in addition to an excellent mouthfeel (largely due to more active carbonation and a lack of cloying, sticky sweetness)."
"High in subtlety and a great mouthfeel. I had a bottle of Maredsous 8 yesterday, and this restores my faith in the style! I just want to leave this in my mouth and swirl it around for a while."
"Overall this is a very enjoyable beer, but one that I don't think quite lives up to the hype. Westy 12 is a flat-out excellent beer, but I worry that the 8 is kinda riding the coat-tails of its big brother. It's a good beer, but not one that's worthy of being in the top 10 beers in the world, if you ask me."
"D-I could pound these puppies but I am also excited to see this one aged for a few years to see if it becomes more complex as the heat dies down a bit."
"8% ABV. Tasted on self-proclaimed ""Westy day"" 01/06/11 with my beer aficionado buddy. This wonderful dubbel trappist beer was bottled in 2010 (with date stamped 15.01.13 on cap). After pouring, the beer gave off a cloudy brown/bronze appearance, left a very nice foamy head. The smell was initially subdued probably because it was too cold, then the flavors started coming out when above room temperature... with the love the St. Sixtus monks put in this beer. This is a definitely complex and mysterious beer, one I truly embraced. It gave off a bitter mouthability, then soothed out at the end. This smooth taste consisted of caramel, sweet malts, subdued raisins, Belgian candy sugar. The Westy 8 is a well-balanced beer and one that I will gladly drink any day."
"If you get one, you'll be happy, but don't pay $100 for one unless you are rich. Can't wait to try one of the 12's"
"I always wondered if it would live up to the hype and indeed it did and more. The impression I was left with was the unbelievable robustness and complexity, yet perfectly balanced and smooth."
"So does it live up to the hype? I'm not sure but it is a great beer no matter how you look at it. This one shows that you don't have to be over the top with ABV or IBU to be world class. Very understated and solid in every aspect. I would put it at the top of the style. I'd take one of these any time I get the chance. Hopefully some day I'll get to taste it at the source."
"Bottle procured from the Struise Yeast Shop. Best by 27.01.13 indicated on the label. Pours a muddy plum color with a hazy clarity. Head was a rocky and cream-colored and half an inch in height. A couple large swaths and a few residual spots of lacing adhered to the sides of the glass during the tasting. Head was refreshed with a swirl. Big yeasty nose with a figs, prunes and a bready quality following behind. Taste follows nose; completely style consistent, but a bit dull. There's also a slightly herbal/chemical character present, probably attributable to the yeast strain. The mouthfeel kills this beer for me. Carbonation is very aggressive and the burn lingers between quaffs. Consistency is light-medium (but closer to light) and finish is semi-dry. I have to say that I was expecting a bit more from this beer. Perhaps it could stand some aging, and I will definitely procure another bottle if the opportunity presents; however, the carbonation completed detracted from the experience. It did improve slightly by gently swirling the glass to dissipate the gas, making it an almost pleasant sipper; however, I suspect it might be too young."
"D - Too smooth...very easy drinking. Didn't leave the lasting impression of Westy 12, but definitely not a disappointment at all."
"Much thanks Thjis!"
"One word....AWESOME."
"This was an extremely difficult bottle to pour! There were lees evident along the sides of the bottle as well as in the kick. My gentle pour created only wisps along the center of the beer. Color was a deep amber, almost brown and with NE-quality clarity in the first glass (of two) that was poured. The second glass picked up some of the less, despite my best efforts to avoid it. I did my best to warm it from the refrigerator to get the nose to come forward. The first thing that I got were notes of dark, dried fruit - raisins, plums and cherries; caramel/butterscotch; and and earthy birch beer/cola scent. Wow! Mouthfeel was effervescent with a minty quality to accompany the hazelnut/astringent/drying taste on the tongue. The finish was extremely dry, leaving me literally gasping. The glass with the lees was also passed around and that had a quality of oily sludge with a taste of bitter coffee and dark chocolate. With the glass nearly empty, we combined the lees and the clarified pour for another, different taste that seemed to combine all of the flavors previously noted. Zounds!"
"D: The booze was in there somewhere, but I certainly couldn't find it. I see the appeal of this brew, and am a true believer in it."
"D/M: Crisp and good weighted beer. These beers always give me the sense of a church...like drinking a pew or something. Not bad a all. Really great present to get."
"Westy 8 is balanced and subtle. It didn't knock my socks off the way the 12 did, but it deserves its reputation. Understated and elegant."
"A wonderfully crafted Belgian ale with lots of character. The alcohol is well hidden and this is just really good. What I really like is that I get lots of the notes I love in Flanders Reds in this without the sourness which makes it like a great blend of Flanders and Dubbel."
"Drinkability is killer. I drank my half of the bottle in around ten minutes. I think I was expecting more overt complexity, but that was mere foolishness, and this was a bit of a (well-deserved) slap in the face. Masterfully balanced and nuanced; a reminder of what beer can and should be."
"D - Excellent. The dry and clean finish make this beer super easy to put down. Tasty and satisfying."
"D: Wonderful wonderful beer. I would have to concur that this could possibly be the best for its style. 8 is however, not quite as decadent as the 12. Hardly anything is, even from the same brewery. Again, I cannot thank you enough ipa247 for letting me try this brew."
"This is a highly carbonated offering that somewhat exaggerates the alcohol with a sort of evaporative quality when it hits the tongue. It is medium bodied, super smooth and very drinkable. I have only had this brew on one other occasion and that experience was better than this one. Perhaps it was a bottle with a little bit of age on it. Regardless, a fantastic brew."
"Overall: The newer beer is good, but the aged beer is spectacular. Put this one on your shelf for a year or two and taste the difference - older beers will loose a lot of the hoppy tanginess of the younger beers, but instead develop an enveloping raisiny richness."
"Overall - I'm starting to believe that Trappist Monks are proof of god existing. Seriously, this beer was a joy to drink, and for the first time in a long time, I'm sad now that my glass is empty. I want more. Oh god do I want more."
"D and Notes: I've heard from many people that this is better than the 12. I don't quite agree, but it was a great pair with the pate and the abbey cheese. very drinkable for the strength as well."
"Most grateful indeed. A sacred brew worthy of sacred appreciation given this rare opportunity."
"I gotta thank Matt for cracking this one I know you were saving it for some time now. Overall I can't wait to try a 12, this one was close to a 5 in one or two departments if a 4.75 was a option it would have been dropped here."
"D - it doesnt get much better than this. pair it with some creamy and pungent cheese (a must with this one) and you'll experience a flavorgasm. this beer is quite deserving of the respect it receives, and it a stellar example of the style. cheers to the St. Sixtus brothers for this masterpiece!"
"d - Overall I thought this was an amazing dubbel. I thought it looked and smelled amazing, and the mouthfeel was perfect. While I think the taste was very enjoyable, it was probably the weakest part of this beer. I would have liked a little less alcohol in the taste. That being said the taste is still great, it's just that the smell and mouthfeel are pretty much perfect. Would love to get some more of this."
"Wasn't that impressed and imho this one is more undeservedly hyped than the 12... my friend loves this one, prefers it over the 12, but I don't find it nearly as complex, full, sweet and creamy as the 12. But to each his own. Dark fruit, a bit on the light side, and a bit too much of an alcohol taste. Don't get me wrong, it was good, but not as good as I expected. Then again, it was a fresh one, If I can age a couple of bottles, maybe I can upgrade this one."
"Found this on a shelf in a beer store in Brussels. Like the 12 I found this was also 10 euro and I had to but it. I know about the monks and all, but if it is for sale and I can't get to them, I would snatch this up in a hurry. Quite good and tasty, but not blowing my mind like I was hoping. I really liked it, but maybe because it is not my favorite style it did not seem as good?"
"How do you even judge this?  It's like an orgasm in liquid form. A truly exceptional, amazing beer. Hands down one of the most delicately crafted beers I've ever had. Just shy of perfection due to slight booze.  An absolute knockout!  I'm already looking forward to the rematch!"
"Drinkability: While the booze does limit the drinkability, it is still a very smooth brew."
"I have two more bottles of Westvleteren 8 that I'll try to keep and age until it's best by date and try one in a 1-2 years and one in 3 years. Looking forward to it."
"It has a brown hue, like caramel, and is translucent. There is a good tan bubbly head. I can smell caramel, plums, brown and crystal sugars. The flavor has notes of a fine chocolate, but also some plum and other dark fruits. The yeast imparts an interesting aspect that is hard to summarize from my pour (I have a bottle of this in my cellar that I hope will help me expand this review). Overall, the taste is sweet and effervescent. The sweetness lingers. It has a medium body and low carbonation. The coat isn't very big, which I found slightly surprising. It is a very drinkable beer. Having a bottle or two in a session would be perfect."
"D: Wow...this is perfection in a bottle. I prefer this to the 12 as it's more drinkable. It's not so much the sipper that 12 is, thus I have to score this higher in my book. I would love to sit down with a few bottles around a fire pit on a cool winter evening! Eh, maybe someday!"
"Thanks to Don for bringing this one to an EPIC tasting! Poured into a generic tulip. Nice off white head. Moderate retention. Ruby body. Aroma of dark, over ripe pitted fruits. Taste is raisins, brown sugar and liquid gold. Greatness, everything expected and a little more. Smooth as can be with no abv noted. Perfection."
"D- Without a doubt would drink it again. Makes me want to try a fresh one."
"Bottle marked 20-09-10. Pours with a fluffy, light tan head that sticks over a deep, hazy, amber brown body. Great lace. Aroma is banana, licorice, light alcohol, plums, yeast, dried fruits and candi sugar. A bit on the non assertive side. Taste is rum, dark fruits, plum and a touch of wheat. Water like consistency, light bubbles. Very good, albeit understated beer."
"Nothing special but enjoyable in their cafe on a sunny day."
"Thanks Thijs for letting me get this great beer. After waiting for a few weeks, I finally decided to crack this open. Served into a wine glass since I just moved and had my specialty glasses in boxes. Ohh lots of head, creamy and rich. Hints of caramel but not too sweet. Perfection on this style!"
"Overall: This is really a great beer. Glad I finally got the chance to try it, I will certainly seek it out again in the future."
"Thanks Thijs, a real treat."
"D-Excellent beer. Not as heavy as 12. Still has complexity and far from a disappointment after having 12. If I have the honor of drinking this again. I will."
"D- Very complex and apparent smells and flavours stand out well. You dont have to go looking for them at all. A very drinkable dubbel with a smoothness that gives a fantastic mouthfeel. Not had fresh but those 11 years did not do any harm!"
"Clear, deep burgandy tone. Nicely whipped head of light beige froth adorns the surface and has great retention and lacing ability. Initial blast of alcohol on the nostrils subsides as the sweet bubblegum and rock candy notes take over. There's also a raisiny, rummy characteristic on the nose. Very nice aroma. The flavors are complex, yet subdued. A graceful profile of dates, figs, plums, raisins, bubblegum, rum, toffee and chocolate. A spicy, alcoholic bitterness resides on the tongue after the swallow and detracts just a little from the overall drinking experience. Mouthfeel is light and airy. It almost melts in the mouth like cotton candy. Carbonation is appropriate. Good dubbel."
"Notes: I usually don't like ""Dubbels"" but this is by far the best one out there...it has to be, seriously! Complex, but doesn't demand your full attention and has a nice balance between bitterness and sweet-/creaminess."
"It smells of fruits and spices with a bit of grains. The taste is where this beer shines. It hits you with a sweet sugar taste right at the beginning, then followed quickly by the fruit. It almost taste like a grape juice for the first split second. Then it turns grainy and that beer flavor that is so important to a good beer is there. The thing that is odd for me about this beer is just as fast as all these flavors hit your pallet they are gone again. This beer had almost no after taste at all. An oddity for a beer of this complexity."
"Pours a molasses murky brown into a westvleteren chalice, big creamy frothy head is present and recedes into a small layer of thin bubbles. Smell is sugary and soapy with golden raisin and dark wheat bread present. Taste is filled with notes of darkfruits, bready and it's slightly smoky. Mouthfeel is silky smooth with a carbonated fizz at the end, it's really nice. I could have a few of these but won't because I'd be feeling like crap cause I drank them all so soon. My favorite Dubbel ever."
"Notes: Best before 30/09/12. Very good beer, and right at the same level as the 12. Very complex, malty beer. Very easy to drink, if only it was easier to get."
"Overall - Despite the hype that the 12 gets, the 8 holds its own as one of the better/best dubbel's out there. My distaste for high carbonation aside, this is a great beer and a great example of the style. Thanks again, Jeffrey!"
"As I said this really has redefined the style for me, one thing that normally bugs me about dubbels is some feel really thin in the mouth, where this really fills it up and is solid through the sip."
"One thing that hurt the beer just a tad is the amount of carbonation. Just a little too much, as this beer was very fresh. I have another one in my cellar, so I am anxious to see how it turns out. If it is anything near the 3 year old Westy 12 I had, I am in for a treat."
"D: I could, and would, drink this beer very regularly, if only that were possible. This is a truly special beer and absolutely worthy of any and all praises."
"Big thanks to billinlafayette for this one! Dated 29.09.09 on cap. Served from bottle into a McChouffe goblet. Pours a dark brown with one finger off white head that contains a dusting of brown sediment on the top. Maintains excellent lacing throughout. The aroma is comprised of mat, fruit, alcohol, and citrus. The flavor is of big fruit, alcohol, malt, and a smooth creamy followthrough. It is medium on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this brew is phenomenal. I was expecting it to be good, but wow... The aroma and flavor of this brew is beautiful. Definitely the best of this style I have had to date. Believe the hype people!"
"D: Super solid Belgian with incredible balance in both aroma and flavor. This one is very drinkable with a feel that is smooth and really serves to both meld and separate the complexities of this beer. Worth the trouble without a doubt!"
"M & D - Very nice crisp and dry. Great fluffy mouthfeel with almost perfect CO2 content. Good full body with great overall flavors. I would drink this all day, everyday even with the ABV."
"Best estimate is that this is a sweeter version of a Westmalle Double. Undated bottle, assumed to be brewed in '09. Had at Cafe Gollem in mid-May."
"D: Wonderful"
"D- Wow very awesome. I think I could drink this one all day long!"
"Upper medium bodied with a medium level of carbonation and some alcohol warming. An enjoyable Dubbel."
"I find Westy 8 to be the finest offering by this Trappist Monestary and one of the best examples of the belgian double style around."
"330 ml bottle, bought at Voldby Købmandsgård, Denmark. ABV is 8%. Cloudy dark brown colour, huge and lasting beige head. Aroma of wood, dark fruits and spices, hints of leather. Outstanding flavour with oaky and vinous notes, also notes of dark candi sugar and dark dried fruits. Fairly sweet, moderate hops in the finish. Expensive, but worth it."
"Pours a dark brown with a reddish tint where light penetrates. Head was massive on the pour but settled to a skim of frothy, eggshell white. Nose is, at first bombarded by sweetness with raisins, cherries, toffee, bready yeast, brown sugar, molasses. Taste is rum, raisins, grape, caramel. Tartness comes in and the finish is a complex interplay - sweet, sour, dry. There is a nice alcohol warming as well. This beer is highly carbonated at the start but calms as it warms. Mouthfeel is medium to heavy and almost chewy, coating the tongue but very pleasantly. I am not a huge fan of Dubbels, but this truly is an exemplary beer. If you can get it, you must."
"Between medium and full bodied, smooth, easy to drink, with perfect carbonation. Try as hard as I can, I cannot find a flaw with this beer. This is so drinkable it is insane. The 8.00 % alcohol is perfectly hidden. There is nothing more to say, except that this is a perfect beer."
"Overall I'm not blown away by this beer especially when it comes so highly rated. It is a solid example of the style with some funky Trappist notes."
"served in my duvel tulip. pours a murky mahogany brown. wonderful foamy head amplified by the glass. tart nose of fruits (blueberry, rhubarb) and yeast. some off notes of sharp funky yeasts. reminiscent of urinal cake. tastes of dark bread, maple, and fig. rather underwhelming in terms of tastes. mouthfeel is soft, almost creamy and delightfully under-carbonated. incredibly drinkable."
"Consumed: 6/19/2010"
"Drinkability: I expected this, as one may assume, to be pretty amazing. And though it was good and I enjoyed it, I've had better and more complex and nuanced Dubbels in the past. Did I wait too long, since I've had the bottle for five years or more? I thought this would keep for many more years. I'm glad I finally tried it and waited, but I was hoping for more. It just feels like it's a shadow of its former self, in some ways, or that it's lost a step. Maybe someday I'll get to try a 12."
"Pours a chocolate murky brown haze with an off white foam head. Is less creamy and the alcohol comes through more than with it's 12 brethren. Sweet up front. Dark fruit throughout. Nice chocolate notes on the back end. Has a Dry sweet finish. Very nice beer."
"Drinkability: Tons of complexity from start to finish. Easily one of the top dubbels out there."
"drinkability: Super impressed. worth the anticipation, but maybe not the price."
"amazing flavors, amazing scent, and huge complexity. this never once got boring, only made me want more. the 8% is well hidden. this is a treat, and i would give anything for another."
"It's lovely and warming as you drink it. Just as good as its big brother, just enough character to distinguish it from being Westy 12, Jr."
"(D)- A superb Dubbel. I can definitely see how this has had rave reviews. A perfect example of the style and a joy to consume. I would love to have this on a more regular basis if it was not so hard to acquire. I am glad to have finally tried this!"
"I wish I had another, it was well worth the money."
"Drinkability is endless. It goes down so smoothly and is so delicious, with only the slightest bite from the alcohol. I definitely enjoyed this beer, and it certainly lived up to the hype."
"M/D - Medium body with a semi-sweet finish...not dry at all. Hardly any alcohol flavor and the flavor combination present in this beer makes it way too easy to drink. Great beer!"
"As amazing as Westy 12 is, I would have to say I enjoy this a bit more due simply to the fact that it's more drinkable."
"This brew pours a beautiful dark caramel brown. Pure Belgian on the front end, and roasty sweetness on the back end. How could I not like a beer that cost over $35 for a 12 oz. bottle? Since it was a gift, I like it even better. If you have an opportunity to try this beer, please do. I actually like the #12 better though."
"Pours a hazy russet with lots of fine bubbles and a dense, cappuccino-colored head that settles into a thin cap. The smell is cherry, oak, papaya, and honey. The taste is complex: sweet tropical fruit, oak, some nuttiness, and a bitter mineral finish. It's a little creamy, highly effervescent, dense but light at the same time -- dreamy. It goes down easy, but I'm sipping it. Wish I had another."
"Part of the reason for the apparent lightness of the flavor may be the high degree of carbonation. I would say that it masks some of the flavors, trying to be an attraction of its own, but it does seem to energize the beer, deftly concealing the moderate alcohol level, and thus helping it go down way too easily. As the carbonation settles out a bit, the flavors are allowed to shine a bit more, bringing on a kind of second stage of the drinking experience. Overall, this one is truly interesting, unique, and exceptionally drinkable."
"D - It gets too sweet and syrupy for me to session, but could drink a decent amount of this happily. Great brew."
"Very drinkable with it's 8%."
"I put this beer in a category of its own. Its a winner and clearly a champion."
"D - One of the best dubbels I have had for sure, an excellent trappist - I spent some time savoring this but would love to see what it is like fresh. I think it might rate a bit higher since the age could have dried it out a bit."
"I figured I should pop open something decent for my birthday, and I figured this would do. Pours dark brown with a thick head. Grape, caramel malt, candi sugar, and tobacco nose. Flavor was very similar, lots of dark fruits come out as well. Finish was thick, lots of stuff going on but not something I really cared for."
"Cheers to the great dubbels of Belgium!"
"Drinkability: Most dubbels I've had are a bit thicker or richer, which makes this one stand out. Unbelievably drinkable. I could drink this anytime, anywhere."
"O: Complex, but very drinkable. Lots of different flavors that are well balanced. Best Dubbel I have ever had and I could drink a 6 pack if I wanted to crappie flop all over the place as the alcohol is quite high! Get this beer!"
"Wow what can I say about this beer that hasn't already been said. It's a little bit sweet, with figs, dried plums, and brown sugar throughout. A brief hint of hops. There is a nice chewiness about the beer and it has a spicy dry finish with just a touch of alcohol that tops the whole thing off making this a fantastic beer that I could drink again and agin."
"D: My first Westy didn't disappoint. I'm not always the biggest fan of dubbels, but this was quite complex and flavorful. I understand why it's so highly regarded."
"D- The carbonation issue and the associated bloatiness makes it hard to drink in volume."
"O: A beer that is worth it's top 10 ""magical"" status, but I've enjoyed other beers more. The pinnacle of dubbels, probably."
"D: Any day. Absolutely delicious. Tasty, fruity, yeasty, and a perfect beer for the moment, whatever the moment may be."
"drinkability - goes down smooth and easy"
"This is the best dubbel I've ever had, so let me say that up front. I could just breathe in the smell all day, like putting your face in a bag of sugar, but balanced by apples and dark fruits. This bottle was 2yr old and the flavor had synthesized in a way that I do not have grammar to describe. There is a subtlety, depth, and smoothness that is unmatched by any dubble I have ever had. Westmalle is a close second, but this is the ultimate."
"I drank the 8 last night (july 30th 2011) after i drank a westy 12. There is a big difference between these beers, always has been. The one i had yesterday had a bit more sourness in it than i could remember."
"This is a very easy-to-drink Trappist beer. I prefer it to the 12."
"D: Amazing. Such a complex and wonderful beer. I actually think I like this better than the 12, at least while they are relatively fresh."
"Pours a clear amber/brown with a ton of carbonation and a massive light tan head. Out of this large head bellows the aromas of fruit, spices, and yeast that make the mouth water. The nice blend of flavors is a repeat of the smell but with more complexity"
"My first official beer review and my first Westvleteren 8. Great way to start things."
"I don't usually like dubbel, but there's just nothing to say here. The key I feel is that it's so well-balanced. There's nothing extreme in this beer, but just unquestionable craftsmanship."
"Overall, this is my first Westvleteren 8 and it is quite good. It's not a top 10 beer in my book, but definitely the best dubbel I have ever had. The Westvleteren 12 is amazing and I guess the 8 fits in nicely as the runner up to Westvleteren's flagship beer. If you haven't had the 8, its worth buying/trading for. An excellent Belgian both in taste and style."
"This might be my best in style for the dubbel. If only it were more available."
"A lot of things are sayed about trappist beers, and I am positive, the are all true."
"Out of a bottle this famous and highly sought-after beer was a deer brown color that was approaching black. Some ruby highlights could be seen when held up to a bright light. The retention and lacing were both impressive. The aroma was rich and bold with an array of 'dark' elements such as chocolate, plums, figs and raisins, some earth and wood, coffee and caramel malt. The flavors were just as intense and varied but I find myself compelled to add a caveat here; having tried the Westy 12 I thought this beer (the 8) to be great, yet still lacking the dimension of subtlety and finesse that the 12 developed. Don't get me wrong, many of the undeniably advanced elements that the Westy 8 possessed impressed me but I just didn't think it was as well executed as it could be. The mouthfeel was just as smooth and rich as one could want, however, and the body as full as one would expect. Equally, the carbonation was spot on. A very ,very good beer and worthy of being classified as one of the worlds best. Were it not for the fact that this same brewery produces a slightly great beer than this one, one would indeed be inclined to say it is THE best in the world. No doubt, as far as the Dubbel style is concerned, it remains an undisputed bar by which others are measured."
"D- I would drink 24 of these if it wasnt so damn hard to get."
"3 way blind taste test alongside pannepot grand reserva 2006 and pannepot reserva 2006. Wild yeast aromas, quite barn like with lots of hay. Nice orval like taste, very wild and funky tons of fruit as well, cherries mainly. Some spice. Slightly sub par palate, kind of fizzy, but this beer was very young."
"33cl bottle thanks to bret27. Hazy brown (bottom of bottle) with a creamy beige head. Bright fruity yeasty aroma with intense dried fruit, apples and spice, and a light touch of roasted banana. Flavors of dried fruits, light hoppy balance, just a touch of alcohol, and and overall yeasty profile. Medium bodied with medium-high carbonation. Excellently crafted with a perfect balance."
"Almost palpable aromas of sour cherries, dark brown sugar reach on molasses and all kind of berries powdered with cocoa or grated milk chocolate. The flavor profile consists of milk chocolate ice cream with sour cherries & berries and subtle touch of hoppy bitterness that is prolonged into lingering mild bitter aftertaste. Silky smooth, medium bodied nectar with absolutely no alcohol detectable. The smoothest, silkiest beer I've ever tasted. Perhaps less diversity in aroma/flavor profile than12, without evident vinous component and a bit more pronounced hoppiness, but nevertheless equally good as the big brother."
"This is yet again another excellent beer. A little more restrained than the great Westy 12, but an excellent beer in its own right."
"Bottle dated 29.09.10. Dark brown pour with a ruby highlight and a big, rocky, tan head. Aroma is cereal, banana, dates, peppery, with a slight bit of alcohol. Flavor consists of plum, cocoa, lots of esters, peppery and quite a bit of alcohol. Medium body with loads of prickly carbonation."
"Pours a murky cloudy opaque medium dark brown with little head suffice the center and around the rims. The aroma is highly Cherry, plum, fig and other dark fruits along with maybe even a slight hint of chocolate and some bread. the flavor is also cherry, fig and dark fruits with a yeast/ bread presence. Not overly sweet extremely well balanced. The fruits come through even more as the beer warms. I may actually enjoy this over the 12 I will have to try it again."
"D- World class in every sense of the word. Superbly drinkable and amazingly flavorful. Truly a brew to be sipped and savored."
"This is a wonderful beer and less ""thick"" than the Westvleteren 12, the number one beer in the world. This one is actually far better balanced and, dare I say it, actually may be an all around better drinking beer. But, this is my first one. I have 3 more bottles to go!"
"Overall, this beer is good, but not a top 15 beer. Probably not top 100, its just not super special."
"M - Silky smooth but with more body; velvety."
"Taste is also not a let-down. Very sweet, carbonated, raisons....malts...wow."
"Overall- very good, clean and unique. gets too sweet and thin as it warms. not any better than westmalle dubbel or St. B 8."
"Overall a decent beer. I suppose nothing ever lives up to the hype it gets. This one wanted to. It just didn't make it for me. I will have to try it again fro comparisons sake."
"D - Very drinkable for the percent in part because all the flavors are so mellow and the mouthfeel is silky smooth. Great tasting, well brewed, and a very delicious beer. I would welcome any opportunity to have this again."
"O: very full, rich caramel sweetness but dries nicely, complex, nice hop presence, unique, alcohol becomes a bit rough with warmth"
"This one had the unfortunate case of a gusher due to bringing it home in my backpack after miles of walking. It pours opaque, deep red/brown. Nose is raisins, cranberries, soft cloves. Flavor is more of the dark fruit, plus perhaps some banana and finishes with a hint of saltiness and well balanced phenols. The feel is nicely carbonated and a bit creamy. Given the taste, of course it is quite drinkable but if we are allowed to factor in the difficulty of acquiring the beer, I know to take my time with it and enjoy (or split) only one."
"Bottle pours very dark brown with almost no light passing through. A thick tan head forms on top and slowly fades. It never really goes anywhere. Its lasts as I drink it and laces beautifully. Aroma is a wonderful mixture of dark fruit. Plum, raisin, fig, some candi sugar and belgian yeast round out this gem. Prickly mouthfeel from the high carbonation. Flavors follow the nose and finish semi-dry. Alcohol is hidden well. This is a wonderful beer."
"Overall: Great drinkability. Nice sweet fruity and a little nutty character. Not overly sweet. Balanced with a great dry roasted flavor. A small alcohol presence, but that is expected with and ABV of 8%. All of the flavors blend well together."
"Well I picked this one up because they were selling it, but I think I should have just bought another bottle of the Westy 12 which is volumes better than this brew. Either way, for me personally, the price these bottles achieve it too high. The hype and exclusivity keep the ratings high. Don't get me wrong, they are excellent Belgian beers, but a Rochefort 8 or Abt 12 is on the same caliber for 1/3 the price."
"very drinkable...too bad its so difficult to acquire."
"Thanks to dbatch for sending me a bottle of this on his Belgian expedition this year, he was bummed that they didn't sell the 12 for takeaway from the brewery. The visuals are a deep brown/red hue with a big, soapy head that recedes to a nice foamy cap. The smell is very crisp and clean with lots of belgian yeast and malt, along with traces of nuts, fruits and spices. One of the best aromas I have ever experienced. In the taste you pick up dark fruits along with a light caramel sweetness, with a return of the roasted malt and yeast from the aroma. The mouthfeel was nice and creamy, although a little bland at the finish for my taste. A very drinkable dubbel, and definitely worth the hype, although wish it was more available over here in the States. And at the end of the Rochefort - Westvleteren challenge it's...Rochefort by a nose! The mission is still on to sample the Westvleteren 12..."
"Deep brown color with a strong lacy tan head. Malty, nutty aroma. Full mouth. Complex malty, vinuous, nutty flavor with hints of dates, raisins and dark cherries. Amazing complexity grows with each year of storage. Younger brother of the 12 and very nearly as good."
"Vintage - This beer was bottled on August 27, 2008."
"O: Honestly: Fantastic beer! Despite of the hype around Westys, there's no way to deny that, this is a just another perfect beer made by the Sint Sixtus monks"
"Drinkability is pretty good, as it's easy to drink. On the other hand, it's not that interesting, and, in my humble opinion, unnecessarily rare and expensive."
"M/D - When reviewing a world class beer like this, it seems like you never want to drink more than one for want of being mad at yourself for dipping that far into your stash. However, the clean finish on this beer makes it exceedingly drinkable, I imagine that this is what monks kill 6-8 of per night to keep the faith. The mouthfeel is basically perfect for the style!"
"D: Superb. A very nice dubbel, perhaps the best? The combination of profound flavors, solid carbonation, and a good body makes this a very pleasant experience."
"Good beer, not worth the trouble to obtain though."
"Drinkability: a great flavor with a great texture; despite the alcohol this is supremely drinkable."
"D - Off the charts for the style."
"For those interested, the bottle shop a few doors down had some of the 8 in their cooler."
"D- A bit too prickly, really tasty though. Just behind the 12, but very good in its own right."
"I'm going out on a limb here and saying that it is better than West 12."
"-Bye"
"Got a Westy 8. Served in a Chimay goblet (at least its a Trappist glass). Thick fine brown head. The head was great when I poured it and has lasted as I drink. The head leaves a nice lacing on the glass. The aroma is amazing. That great smell of Belgian yeast, like on the air. The carbonation is steady with tiny bubbles all over the outside of the glass. The mouthfeel is smooth, I could drink 10 of these in no time at all. The flavor is sweet and yeasty. It is a great example of a style that I am not usually thrilled with, dubbels. I really like this beer a lot. Its truly one of the great beers of the world."
"Pours garnet/brown color with huge light tan head. There's some yeast murk even though I left a lot of it in the bottle. Even 10 minutes after pouring, there's still quite a bit of foam sitting on the surface. I don't even know how to describe this smell, since I haven't smelled many beers like it. Fresh apples, grapes, a cornucopia of other dark fruits, yeast. There's all sorts of other stuff going on that I can't identify. Same goes for the taste - the balance of fruit, malt, spice, and candi sugar is really good; and there's a very slight tartness that underlies everything. Medium body and high carbonation. Because of all the hype, I didn't want to give this beer a high score if I could help it. But the acclaim is well deserved. This is one of the best beers I've ever had, and reminds me that many American brewers have a long way to go to replicate the quality of great Belgian-style beers."
"Overall: Literature varies whether this is a dubbel or strong ale. Either way it tastes almost like nice cream ale or something, but w/unique belgian qualities. Could drink all day, and would if I could buy it locally. Delicious."
"Bottled in September of 2008. Pours thickly veiled brown with yellow-tan highlights -- almost like the inside of an overripe plum. Modest head dissipates to a fine surface film. Smells of prune, plum, banana, a little bit of cherry-tinged funk. Comes together to smell a bit like unsweetened purple grape juice. The smell is a true harbinger of the taste: deep plum and light caramel flavors form the backbone as banana and subtle cherry tart notes take turns. The light tartness builds a bit and ends up being the last note at the finish line. Lots of subtle complexity here for the style: no one flavor dominates or speaks out of turn. Very drinkable in that you can keep discovering new flavors over multiple servings. A real standout in the Belgian brown class."
"Very carbonated mouthfeel. Could drink these all day. An excellent beer."
"Overall, I think this is a really good beer, but maybe not to the level as it's revered. The flavor is good, although it needs a little more complexity for me to really be amazing. At face value the flavor is just too predominantly brown sugar, caramel and I wish the darker fruits would have come out more."
"MF&D - how do you describe a perfect dubbel? the feel is perfect: perfect small, crisp carbonation combine with the ample body to make a completely chewy and creamy experience. the beer is so incredibly creamy from the carbonation, and the body, coupled with the carbonation makes this rich chewy kind of feeling. simply superb! needless to say, I would drink this anytime with anything. I just cant wait to see what the 12 has in store!"
"D: WOW, a unique experience. This makes me want to store beer.... without the dusty taste of course."
"These beers really need to be in bombers."
"Well, I guess I have come to the conclusion that dubbels just are not a style I can enjoy. This is the highest rated dubbel on BA, in the top 10 overall, and possibly the best one I have had yet I still can't bring myself to give it more than a 4 for taste. I was hoping that this one would break the streak and stand out like its big brother #12 does, but alas it ends up being just a ""good"" beer for my palate"
"Overall, really a fantastic beer. Pity this bottle had a slightly (hidden) dusty taste. A previous bottle from the same batch was better. I think I will rate that bottle instead of this one. Anyhow, one of the better beers one can have. get it get it get it, I will drink it surely again!"
"The unlabeled bottle looks really good, the beer in the glass also. Starts modest malty, a little bit alcoholic, not too intense. Finish mild, notes of marzipan, warming. Harmonic aftertaste. Really good, but not as good as exspected. Thanks to HenrikSoegaard for the bottle!"
"Delicious."
"D: This went down really easy, despite its big beer status and strong flavors. A testament to its balance and craft. It's unfortunate that it costs so damn much, but I must honestly admit, I'd buy it again if I had the chance."
"D= great. This sipper is amazing. Truelt lives up to the hype and its a style I usually don't enjoy much of at all."
"I had this bottle in my cellar for nearly a year after it was sent to me from abroad. It poured a fairly dark, hazy brown with a light tan head. The head dissipated a little but held a nice thin covering even after a few sips. The smell is amazing, rich aroma of dark fruits, malt and some hops. At first the taste hits with sweet caramel and dark fruit (raisin, fig?) and then some slight sting of alcohol that fades into gentle bread malts. I had to stop myself from drinking it too fast because I wanted to drink it down in one gulp it was that delicious. Even the the belching that followed tasted delightful."
"Pours a hazy brown with a big foamy light tan head that resists fading. Visibly effervescent, the collar leaves excellent stringy patterns of Belgian lace. The smell is rich and earthy dark fruit and malty cocoa. Lively mouth feel with a little heat and a lighter body that works with the full rich caramel and fruit flavors. The lingering aspect adds complexity that gives it a larger presence. A really nice drinker...gone way too quickly. Many thanks to Alen for the opportunity!"
"I received this bottle as an extra in a trade, I can't remember who from so I can't give you credit whoever you are. Poured an active murky, oily, redish/brown body with an off white/tan head that lasted a while. Smells of cherry, raisin, very floral. Taste was amazing with dark fruits as in the taste. The 8% come through in the end as it warms a bit. Medium body that was fairly fizzy,"
"D: A good beer, very good actually. Complex, well balanced and tasty. But one of the best beers in the world? Perhaps not, in my humble opinion."
"After taking my last sip, Wheatman106, Jimmy and I cracked open the Westveleteren 12 and to say the least we all were blown away by both of this beers. Kudos to the Trappist monks, without them I would not know what the taste of perfection would be."
"Mouthfeel is on the heavy side of medium. I was almost expecting a chewy feel based on the look, but it's really pretty smooth. Drinkability is decent. I still think the Westmalle Dubbel is better. As far as Wesvleteren goes, I think this one is better than the blonde, but not as good as the 12. Very happy I got to try it, though."
"This is drinkable brew, and I'm glad I had the opportunity to try it as it seems it's not the easiest beer to acquire."
"Overall this beer lived up to it's billing. The flavors weren't the best part of the beer, but rather how they entered and faded at just the right times - though the solid levels of carbonation helped things along nicely. However, I've heard many people say they liked the 8 better than the 12 and I have to respectfully disagree, though just by a hair. Give both a shot if at all possible."
"D: Absolutely a well-crafted beer, glad that I had the opportunity to try it. I'd definitely drink it more often it wasn't so hard to come across. Goes down very smooth and surprisingly light."
"Great drinkability, if only this wasn't so hard to obtain. Or should I add, at a more friendly price."
"It feels slightly blasphemous, but I was not blown away by this beer. I do have a few more bottles, and I will happy to give it another chance every opportunity I get. I get the feeling that this could definitely benefit from aging for a good while, and I'll definitely be putting that theory to practice given the young age of this particular bottle."
"Drinkability: Wow! Really. Just outstanding. Low apparent ABV, but it rocks, and I want another sip. And another. And another. I want to marry this beer."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied and creamy smooth with a strong biting carbonation."
"A million thanks go out to deepsouth for this amazing extra in a trade! Date code 22-11-10. Pours a dark brown color with amber highlights, a thin cap that stuck around throughout, and little lacing. Lots of sediment in the bottle that I tried to keep out. Aroma is grassy, a bit of dark fruit, lightly sweet, some brown sugar and apples, yeasty, smells great! Flavor is very nice! Hints of chocolate, candied dark fruits, brown sugar, herbaceous hops, a hint of raisins, a bit of grassiness and a hint of musty sourness. The aftertaste lingers for quite a bit and there's a faint roasted coffee and burnt caramel flavor that sticks to the tongue. Tastes fantastic. Flavor is on the higher side of medium, but still medium and nice crisp carbonation. This is a very tasty beer, but I could only see myself having one at a time, but it was great to be able to sample this rare treat. Thanks again, Jason!"
"Pours a light brown with a off-white head into my Chimay goblet. Taste is sweet, but not overly so, which I prefer. Dark fruit (plums, cranberries, raisins, etc.) really sticks out on my palate along with some alcohol bitterness on the finish. Mouthfeel is good, light-medium in body, coats the mouth well. I prefer this Dubbel to the Quad and will drink again, for sure."
"Overall, I have to say that this lives up to the hype. Really fortunate to have tried this at least once, and I really hope to be able to have it again someday. Really is a shame I can't access this regularly. Wonderful brew."
"P.S. I appreciated this one more than the 12."
"Overall: A let down for me. A good beer but not an outstanding one from my point of view. It really felt like i was drinking liquid herbs (no other way to explain it) and really over-powered any other flavor that might have been there, not too pleasant. Still, i would like to try it again to give it another chance."
"OVERALL: This one is definitely worth the hype. Easily the best all-round Belgian dubbel I've had, and I've certainly had my share. I could never wait for the next sip. The smell and especially the taste profile make this one totally worthy of its top 10 spot and a must-try for every beer lover out there. I'll certainly be picking more of these up when I happen to see them. Recommended."
"Very good standout brew."
"Great beer. Big thanks to ygtbsm94, I was glad to try this with a little age on it."
"This is a very good beer that I was glad to be able to try. A benchmark as a well-crafted dubbel. But is it worthy of a top 10 rating on my list? Probably not."
"If I had to use one word to describe this beer it would be ""graceful."" Truly world-class in every sense."
"d) Very smooth, very drinkable, and very more-ish for the sweettooth. Wonderful"
"Pours a very dark brown, hazy looking, with a cm thick off-white head, that kind of falls back and sticks around. Looks about right. The smell is immediately of sweetness. There are notes of chocolate, mixed in with just a note of coffee. There is a tiny note of alcohol, a few estery smells. There is very faintly an earthy, spicy smell. The taste has a cola/caramel sweetness, but is backed with quite a bit of complexity. There's chocolate and raisins and dark roasted malts and tamarind with a pleasant estery finish. The alcohol warms on the finish, but is barely detectable otherwise. The mouthfeel could be a bit more chewy, but there is a bit of body to it, but the carbonation provides a pleasant tickle on the way down. The drinkability of this is really what shines. I just wanted to chug it down and go on to the next (and I'd certainly feel that one on my wallet), but I knew that I needed to wait and savor this one."
"Overall: well crafted, not my thing"
"A very nice dubbel. The best I've had"
"over all this was a nice beer. preferred it colder over room temp which is one of the only things that i feel brings it down."
"Overall: This is above and beyond any of Dubbel I've had. A must try. Cheers!"
"Everyone should try this beer. I will always try to keep one if these around for a special treat every once in a while."
"Drinkability is great. Perfectly balanced. A world class treat I am glad to have had the opportunity to have tried. Seek it out. Obviously."
"Notes: What a pleasure to have this beer, along with its big brother, the 12 tonight."
"12oz bottle big thanks to deepsouth for sending this my way. First off this smells pretty amazing, light hints of cherry and malts but just a real nice smell, raisins. The flavor is a nice bready dubbel. Nice beer, remimds me of the westmalle dubbel a little bit, very good."
"The drinkability of this beer is just incredible. It's strength is not apparent in the taste, just in the after-effects. I have no desire at all to drink this one quickly, but I feel like it's a flavor I'd never get sick of. Absolutely a drink to savor and enjoy."
"I will look forward to trying the 12!"
"Drinkability: A very nice sipper, and if there beer were readily available I would purchase it often."
"I was quite worried when I decided to open this - it could easily have been utterly foul - but this beer has aged remarkably well. I suspect it'd score a little better earlier in its life (particularly in the appearance and mouthfeel categories), but I'm very glad to have been lucky enough to score such an ancient bottle - gives me hope for the 1980s Westy ABT and Westy 6 I have kicking around."
"D: Great for sipping. However, you wouldn't down these as you would any other dubbel mainly because you'd want to savor the flavor and work out its complexities."
"Drinkable? Um, yes."
"Exceptional. Absolutely exceptional. Unbelievable. Worth every bit of hype you've ever heard. Oh..."
"Drinkability- Amazing brew that I really enjoyed. I always try to go into these 'higher ranked' beers with a open mind and not let any 'hype' reflect my reviewing. As a huge fan of all beers though, it's nearly impossible to not enjoy this beer. Considering the availability of this brew and of Rochefort, Rochefort definitely makes a great substitute. Maybe not AS good, but pretty close. Big thanks to Greg!!"
"An older bottle this time, it seems to have mellowed and improved. An exceptionally good beer, though not quite up to the wow factor of the Westie 12. More bitterness and hop flavour than the rest of the Trappist breweries."
"Drinkability: One of the smoothest, easiest to drink, 8% ABV beverages that will touch your lips."
"Much less intense than the 12, but a great beer nonetheless. Time to enjoy now."
"Umm, incredible. Thinner than the 12. We'll see if a 12 pops out of the cellar for a comparison. To end my internal debate once and for all: is an aged Westvleteren 8 better than a fresh Westvleteren 12?"
"D- Highly drinkable, and unfortunately, very rare. Delicious."
"Huge thanks to isubsmith for hooking up his fellow Rochester BAs with this rare beer. It pours a dark brown color. The head is light tan and recedes slowly into firm lacing which sticks all over to the sides of the glass. The aroma is of plums, anise, leather, and hints of cranberry and dry apple cider. The taste is like the aroma. The mouthfeel is medium-full bodied wtih lively, fine carbonation, and a silky texture. Overall this is a great, complex Belgian dubbel. I would love to make this part of my regular drinking rotation."
"Drinkability- I'd drink nothing but if they weren't so difficult to come by."
"D- Enjoyable and easy to drink. Perhaps this beer is somewhat overrated, but there is no argument that it is at least a really solid Dubbel."
"Anyway, wow, is this ever a pretty beer. Head on the bigger side of medium, tiny dark bubbles, ridiculously lasting lace. Opaque brown. Smells of grass and brown sugar. Ah, well, the nose doesn't lie - brown sugars aplenty, there. Only, sugar in flavor and not in sweetness - it's pretty even and mellow. This has that Belgian astringency that is missing in the 12. It's a very good example of the style."
"M/D - I would barely call it full bodied and very rich feel in the mouth. Well carbonated. Incredible dubbel and very easy drinking."
"I think I'd take this over a westy 12..."
"M/D: Slightly over carbonated, full body. Drinkability is decent as well. Not really ""wooed"" by this beer. It's good, probably not my favorite dubble. Very balance, with the aroma it's most redeeming quality."
"Mouthfeel was lively. Effervescent but not overly carbonated. Medium to full bodied. All around nice beer. I drank this one entirely too fast, so good."
"This beer just didn't seem to have a whole lot going on. It was sweet and it tasted like the artificial grape flavoring you get from candy. It wasn't overwhelming to make it bad, but the beer just didn't impress me a whole lot. That doesn't mean I didn't like it but it was just weird."
"D= Definitely a world class ale. I still cannot decide if I liked the Westy 8 or 12 better. Either way, this beer is worth the hype (but not necessarily the cost)."
"As it warms it gets much better same character just better."
"Pours a beautiful dark reddish/brown with a frothy ½ inch off white/an head. Smells of rich malts, fruity hops, and Belgian yeasts. First sip is way smooth, crisp, and tangy with a lovely balance of malt, hops, and yeast. Sweet and then slightly bitter with pears being the dominate fruit. Super creamy lacing clings so happily to the sides of the glass. So very good...so very good indeed. World Class"
"Much better than the Blonde. This is making me want to crack the 12. Quite drinkable for the style."
"D - Could do a few..."
"D: Overall a perfectly balanced beer with a rich maltiness full of caramel and maple syrup sweetness with a vast complexity of dried fruit. Drinks like a dream leaving a sweet malty lacing behind. Believe it, its not just hype, truly a standout beer amongst all others and the best beer in the world."
"drinkability: great"
"Very good. I would highly recommend this."
"Overall - Another world class brew from Brouwerij Westvleteren although i think a little more age on this would have made it even better... Outstanding and highly recommended...."
"Overall a very very enjoyable and tasty dubbel. Very very rich and fruity taste. Really alot of quad like flavor in here with the dark fruit richness. Another hit from westy. 12 will always be their shining example to me, but 8 is also a very very nice beer."
"Pours a murky iced-tea color with some nice ruby highlights when held to light, a crazy-dense beige head hangs around for the duration, diminishing very slowly in size, but never disappearing. Lots of sediment is suspended in the beer, and some yeast spills out of the bottle, leaving some dark brown swirls in the foamy head. Lots of fig, raisin, and apple on the nose. Red apple flavors come through a lot more as it warms, light brown sugar, some earthiness. Very finely carbonated, really creamy as it hits your lips, but the carbonation makes this one almost refreshing....this would pair with lots of dishes. This is an amazing beer, and I'm thrilled to have had the opportunity to try it!"
"D: Drinkability is great for a sipping-oriented beer. I found myself drinking it back without much second thought. Easy sailing on here, perhaps moreso than some other dubbels. Overall, a wonderful brew - able to drink it with a little more ease than the 12, but in terms of flavour and feel, the big brother still takes it for my palate!"
"D: I could drink a case of this and not blink. These monks know what the fuck is going on. This beer is damned near perfect. I want more and I want to move to Belgium. If you get the chance, do it. All of the above."
"Overall a pretty good dubbel. It's pretty tasty. Try it if you get a chance."
"D : An excellent beer just slightly under the 12 tastewise. I would rate this one as more drinkable in comparison. It was great to drink and with the lower alcohol, just makes it easier to have multiples and enjoy the goodness."
"I owe thanks to abankovich for a bottle. I think PHawk or akorsak also sent one. Thanks, guys!"
"Drinks easy enough, this must be a younger, bottle. I personally was too paranoid to sit on this bottle for too long, if you have a safe cellar. (me, I have 2 kids under 9) then age this to your hearts content. This is not close to my favorite dubbel, feel very fortunate to get to try it though"
"D- Wow very awesome. I think I could drink this one all day long!"
"Drinkability: Rich, punchy and packed with a fruitastic estery character, although it lacks the depth of the yellow-capped twelve or the drinkability of the green-capped blonde. Still recommended, though."
"I tried this beer after doing research on the trappist brewers. All I can say is WOW. Amazing beer that is the best that I have tried thus far in my life. I now have beer that all others will have to measure up to in the dubbel style. My only regret is that I didn't try this beer earlier in my life."
"Westvleteren 8 is one hell of an incredible beer. Frankly, it's slightly better than the 12. Just my personal preference. The only complaint I have is that the nose is slightly weak. Other than that, this is an extremely complex and excellent beer. Simply a ""must get"" for any BA."
"359 reviews as of this writing. thanks to azurelimits for the chance to try this fine beer. Since there are so many reviews I'll note that I have no idea of how old this one is. For the rest I'll say wow, this beer is good. That's the technical review. I am impressed at how the Westy yeasts combined with what I can only imagine is a mineral water quality creates such an amazing experience. It is that good! I'd recommend it to anyone who has a chance to try this fine beer."
"This has become my stranded island beer. That is the highest compliment I can give it."
"What a great beer, I think I like this better than Westy 12. This is a superb beer and one that I wish I had more of. I'm just glad I was able to try this unique and rare offering."
"It's a really good beer, but I don't believe it lives up to the hype. I find too much fault in the thin body, weak aroma, and noticeable alcohol to give it a perfect rating. Definitely a treat to try in Belgium though!"
"Tasty and interesting. Quite smooth and dangerously easy to drink. High ABV is very well hidden. Flavor is mild and unified. I will drink more if I can get a hold of it."
"Very easy drinking and tasty belgian, would be a mainstay in my fridge if it was readily available."
"Westvleteren 8 is ﬁne aged, but it's become a bit too dry and muted for our liking. Delicious fresh, and arguably better than Westvleteren 12 in drinkability."
"Aftertaste reminsicent of quality black tea."
"My thanks to my Westy traders bdrc, hrking, krkearny,ggaughan, banker joe"
"D: This is one of the better examples of a Dubbel I've ever had and the drinkability is off the charts. Big thanks again to Jason for the opportunity to try all of the Westies!"
"Wow I spent a few bucks to buy this beer but boy was it worth it! It poured amber, very cloudy with lots of sediment! The smell was amazing, just like any other well crafted beer. The taste was amazing, the flavors meshed very well with the overlying malt flavors with some nut. The mouthfeel was nice a littl different from your normal beer with all the sediment. I wish I could afford to drink this all the time"
"Wonderfully complex and so enjoyable. I could sip this beer all night long, a phenomenal Dubbel overall. This is another world class beer from Westvleteren - highly recommended."
"D: I'd drink another if I had one."
"D- feels thick on the tongue but smooth. Drink this slowly and savor every sip if you're fortunate enough to acquire it! Its like drinking the world's greatest dessert."
"At Cafe in de Vrede. Pours almost black with a thick two finger, off-white head that lasts and lasts. After a few sips, the lacing is--well, not even lacing, more like a sheet of foam clinging to all sides of the glass. Held up to a light source, the 8 is a beautiful dark ruby red. The nose is fantastic; fruitiness comes through first. Banana, date, cherries, etc. Incredible malt too, along with lots of earthy and floral notes. The taste matches the richness and complexity of the smell and then some. Once again, fruit-like hints are definitely present at first, and then give way to dark complexity. Hints of spice. Hoppiness at the end. Quite sweet, overall. The mouthfeel is another great factor. This is what beer should feel like--a thickness to it that coats the mouth, though it's not syrupy. Good stuff."
"Drinkability - As much as I could see myself believing that this beer is overhyped, I surely tell you it is not. I could definitley see myself drinking a few of these but it probably wouldn't be practical nor very cost effective. A beer to savor and enjoy while relaxing and being able to enjoy the complexity. If you can get your hands on one, which isn't exactlly easy or cheap, I would highly recommend trying this, obviously!"
"Great beers!"
"I'm sad to see my only bottle go but I'm thrilled to have had the opportunity to try this. I wasn't disappointed at all and to make it even more ezciting, I still have a 12 to drink."
"Anyhow, the beer itself looks and smells excellent, extremely dark with a tan head. Definite mix of darker fruits and malts, goes down extremely easy especially for a beer with 8% alcohol. Nicely carbonated, and like its big brother best enjoyed at the cafe opposite the monastery for the full experience."
"Fathead"
"So I finally get to try some Westvleteren 8, and I'm pleasantly surprised. After all the hype I was sure I would be fairrly let down, even though I had a good experience with the 12. I figured that this beer would be somewhat ridding on the coattails of that beer. I was wrong. The first impression upon tasting this was Wow!, this is so fruity and lively. It was much brighter tasting than I expected, extremely floral and with some nice hop bite in the finish. The predominant flavor seeemed to be honeysuckle. Light and effervescent in the mouth, this was unbelievably drinkable and pleasant. The pour was a dark amber with little head, but the aromas immediately lure you in with fresh fruity and floral notes with a bit of metal underneath. Really a classy beer, and if it were more available one that I would probably drink more often than the 12- as much as I love that beer."
"Drinkability/last word- highly drinkable, although not as much as the 6 though. Still, for the style, I've never had a beer that was more drinkable than this one. For me this is certainly the new benchmark when it comes to dubbels. As with the 12 and the 6, the hype behind this beer is well merited."
"Great drinkability, I'm already sad this is my only bottle!"
"Def. worthy of the hype, one of the best beers I have ever had. Everything you expect a belgian to be, and then some. Amazing."
"D: so smooth and subtle it's a challenge to truly appreciate it. I could pound it, but I know it'd be a sin. Wonderful."
"Drinkability is moderate. Great flavors make for easy consumption, but moderately high alcohol limit consumption. A great beer."
"D = This is a very nice beer, I could definitely drink more of these, though with 8% ABV, I might limit myself to one per occasion."
"I was a little skeptical going into this, and the first few tastes had me wondering what the big deal was. Now I get it."
"A very nice beer, but just not quite what I was expecting or hoping. It was good, but I kept on thinking there should be more to it. Oh well..."
"Update: Did a mini vertical of this. A 99 06 and 07. The 99 blew the other away. It was like a really good sherry and made the other seems boozy which they were not. Definately worth holding on to for a year or two. Or 9."
"D- So easy to drink. Its so well-balanced that nothing reaches out & kicks you in the teeth with its overwhelming presence."
"11.2 ounce bottle, cap stamped with 08.06.09. Served in a DFH snifter, the beer pours a murky cola-like brown with a half inch off-white head. Head retention and lacing is good. Aroma is caramel, dark fruit, belgian yeast, peppery spice, brown sugar and molasses. Taste is belgian yeast, dark fruit, pepper/spice, candy sugar, tart apples and brown sugar. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit creamy with good carbonation. Drinkability is very good, it's smooth and easy to drink. I drank this right after I drank the 12, and it's not quite as good as the 12 is but it's still a very good beer. My opinion of this is the same as it is with the 12, it's not worth the price to drink it all the time but it's worth the price to get a couple bottles to try because it is very good (and because of the availability). I'd definitely recommend this to others to try."
"This is very nice beer that is easy on the palate and I could drink a lot more of if it were more available."
"Exceptional. Highest recommendation for the Belgian beer lover."
"The Rochefort 8 does a pretty good job of holding up. Deeper and certainly has a little more of a punch. You can taste the alcohol more with the Rochefort. A little more head, a little more lacing. If somebody put a gun to my head and said choose, I am not sure which direction. Westy by a nosehair???"
"D: This is an easy-drinking Belgian. Quite tasty, and enjoyable. Were it not so rare, I would quite happily drink it frequently."
"Hype factor: Doesn't live up to it in my book, but for me, hyped beers rarely do. Maybe one of the most drinkable Belgian's I've had, and easily the best dubbels I've had. I just had the Allagash dubbel a few days ago, and while a very nice beer, I found it a bit lighter and not quite as pleasing. I must say, however, I don't think with is worthy of being considered a top 10 in the world beer."
"Now this is a great Belgian. It had miles of creamy tan head that lasted for a couple minutes. It reduces down to a silky foam floating on the top. The beer itself was a dark reddish brown. The taste of sweet, yeast, caramel does a great job of hiding the 8% alcohol that sneaks up on you. The beer is thick enough to cover your tongue with the rich taste of heavenly trappist ale you will definately remember."
"Highly drinkable will seek out again I am enjoying this on and will continue to enjoy it with my Easter dinner as a tribute to the monks"
"Pours with an off-white foamy, mostly lasting head. It has a deep amber colour. Lovely fruity aroma. Palate with notes of caramel, raisins and roasted malt. Little sweet/ bitter aftertaste. Praise God who inspirited the monks to create this little miracle."
"Excellent beer that lives up to the hype and just might be better than the 12 imo."
"Overall, I like this beer. Its quite a treat and an honor to be my beer that achieves my Initiate status."
"This is a legend; what else can I say about it."
"Poured into a chalice. Slightly murky, deep coppery rust colour with a thin cap of beige bubbles. Decent head retention, some belgian lace. Looks nice. Fruity, bready aroma with notes of plum, raisin, crust, faint alcohol, some caramel, and a hint of spice. Very mild banana appeared as it warmed. Light alcohol up front along with sweet malts. This dissolves into a caramel and raisin sweetness, dried fruit, giving way to malt and spicy alcohol in the finish. Bready malts linger on the palate. Smooth texture, generous carbonation that feels light and airy rather than aggressive. Pretty tasty and easy to drink, though the alcohol does makes itself known. Malt sweetness really started to dominate as it warmed from just below cellar temperature."

"A superbly balanced beer that can be enjoyed any time. Pairs well with most any meal. Fantastic example of the style."
"D: Very tasty and the 8% is nicely hidden. Two down, one to go."
"This beer is world class and worth the premium paid on ebay. I now have to make a journey to the monastery in order to fully experience this beer. Does it live up to the hype? Yes. I can't wait for the 12 I have in the fridge."
"The pour is very dark brown with some garnet highlights when held to light. The head started bit and fizzy, then settled to around a quarter inch of khaki foam. My first impression of the nose is cherries. A touch of chocolaty raisins. Some dusty yeast character. Very subtle flavors here. Light cherries, banana chips, roasted nuts, raisins. Hell, lets just call this liquid trail mix. Medium body. High carbonation. Creamy. Well, this is certainly a good beer, but it aint all that."
"Taste is toasted amber malts with a burnt characteristic that mellows into a slight hop finish. Nice double however...not as impressive as the 12 is for a quad."
"This certainly lived up to expectations. I'm trying to wait a bit before enjoying the 12, but we'll see how long I can hold out."
"Overall, there's some interesting flavors and its no doubt well crafted, but there's nothing really grabbing me here. I'll give this a re-review if I make my way to Belgium one of these days but don't think I'll go to the trouble of tracking down another bottle state-side. Not my favorite dubbel."
"Soft and expansive textures seem to explode in the mouth giving an airy robustness that's somewhat firm and whimsical at the same time. But the beer's ultimate dry and powdery warmth causes it to disolve on the tongue just like cotton candy, and when the beer finishes there's nothing there to swallow- only an impression of dry fruit and spice that lingers softly in aftertaste but easy on the palate and stomach."
"D - As good as I remember it when I had it in bottles at the Maproom years ago."
"This is as drinkable as it gets. If someone told me that from this day on I could drink only this beer, I'd say bring it on! My favorite beer on the planet, bar none."
"had this in a bottle imported from Belgium to me from a good friend. That's the kicker is the shipping cost on these beers the trip to the Abby and the cost to ship is extreme but the beer is worth it. Light brown appearance with almost a sour farmhouse funk to it very appealing to the palette. Easily drinkable..The only problem was I had 1 bottle the other 2 busted in shipping : ( but it was a treat to be able to drink this rare beers indeed!"
"Its caramelized, malty sweetness is well balanced by the same peppery spiciness suggested on the aroma, and layer upon layer of fruit comes into play. Warmingly alcoholic at times, it is still quite well balanced, and incredibly pleasant."
"D- Very tasty beer. The beer is somewhat light but full flavored. Great beer overall."
"Appearance is a beautiful rich, clear deep brown/amber/burgundy. Very steady head retention with low lacing. The aroma is medium strength, but very consistent. Raisin, malt, and some alcohol. Simple but effective and good. The taste is nice warm and malty front followed by a balanced fruity middle and finishes dry with subtle aftertaste of caramel and some nutty chestnut notes. Mouthfeel is good, very mouth filling. Carb is nice in the middle but not totally present. Water is soft and incredibly drinkable."
"i loved the taste this beer. well balanced and not too much alcohol taste."
"This beer poured a dark brown with a ruby tint - thick head and nice lacing. The aroma is malty and somewhat caramel with the alcohol becoming noticeable as the beer warms. The taste is malty and caramel. Cherry flavors are noticeable. I also picked up a hint of chocolate at the end. The mouthfeel is quite full and suites the flavors. This is simply a delicious beer."
"D: So smooth and creamy and easy to drink. I don't think it gets much better than this!!!"
"Thanks, UncleJimbo, for the long-awaited experience"
"55F into a Tulip. Poured a bit lighter and with a more aggressive head than the 12. Dissipating head cratered from the middle and left a high lacing that looks like it's going to stick around. More spicy nose than big bro, with the expected candi syrup, yeast, and general dark, earthy goodness. Carbonation danced nicely on the sides of my pallete fanning the heavenly fumes back into my nose. Having reviewed the 12 first, I now understand what it will become after a good bit of cellaring. This beer is very drinkable and has a less cloying mouthfeel than 12, but does not carry the sublime messages to my brain. The fruit, raisiny, slightly phenolic notes are there, and make for an intreesting journey. This is a beer I would serve to my father in law as my best brew."
"All in all, an excellent beer, but not truly epic."
"Got from Belgium Shoppe earlier this year and have been aging it for special occasion so opened for birthday and 250th review. Poured from a 33cl bottle with 26.08.09 on the cap. It was a dark ruby color with lots of yeast bits. It had a small head that quickly dissipated. The smell was sweet malts and dark fruits. Not very strong. The taste was even weaker - almost watered down. It didn't really have any dominant traits and for a dubbel was surprisingly bland. Really had no bite at all. Maybe something happened to it during shipping but this one is definitely overhyped and not worth the high scores. I got the 12 in the same shipment and it was really good so surprised by how bland this one was. Will try again during my trip to Belgium next year just to be sure but for now won't be ordering any overseas again. (3, NA, Tie, N)"
"Poured into a Westmalle goblet with a good head and great lacing. I did see a small amount of dark yeast fall into the glass before I could stop the pour. Dark color almost like a light American normal stout, but it let's a purple-like color come through all over, not just the sides. Sweet malty and candy sugar tones waft into my nose. Still smell a bitter flavor inside of the sweetness. Mouthfeel gives a well carbonated, but smooth feel. Like drinking a highly carbonated pop/soda/coke without the bite. The taste is malty, slightly sweet, with spices and a lightly sweet cane sugar background. Very drinkable beer. Very enjoyable. Overall, if I lived in Belgium I would drink this more often it's so good."
"This is my second time having this beer. I bought 2 bottles around 3 years ago. I didn't review the first bottle, but I would say this one was much more memorable. Truly a world class beer."
"This was the first beer I have drank and said to myself that it was way overhyped, I understand the beer's rarity, but there is harder to find beers out there, this is actually quite easy to get now in online auctions, I much rather drink a Rochefort or St. Bernardus, especially for the amount of money you have to fork out to get one of these, it is a good beer but does not deserve to be in the top five in my honest opinion, will try this again in the future to see if I just had a bad batch, and will update my review if anything changes, other than that I recommend it if you are extremely curious like I was, but you will most likely leave disappointed"
"After my 3(!) disappointing tastings of this beer (fresh and from different lots) I really have to say that this beer is not one of the best in the world. OK, 1 or 2 bad beer can happen, but this taste and oxidation is just in the beer and I don't like it."
"Thanks to tpd975 for supplying me with this beaut."
"Notes: Different but nearly as good as Westvleteren 12. This is probably the best dubbel I've had, with St. Bernardus coming fairly close."
"I was fortunate to have a friend in Belgium pick this up for me as it demystified one the most storied beers I had read about in recent years. I shared it with a good friend as it poured majestically into a Trappist glass to a medium dark brown visage. The muscular aroma of apples, champagne, coffee came through in the first taste that was memorable. It reminded me of a darker version of Orval with the yeasty elements of Westmalle and the medium body of a Bier dgarde. The dry chocolaty aftertaste lingered for a long time as the 8 just capped a wonderful evening."
"good drinability due to it's unique, but awesome taste. the peppery flavors, at times sharp carbonation, and alcohol take it down a couple notches, but not enough be any source for compaint or even critique."
"D - Would I drink it again? Yes. Would I pay the same amount to drink it again? No way."
"Highly recommended if you can obtain one. CHEERS!"
"2 Westvleterens down, one more to go!"
"Pours a dark prune with a big frothy head that builds up then dies down to a ring with nice lacing. Smells of caramel, dark fruits, dried fig, some spice, and pear. Taste is delicious with spice and caramel up front but brown sugar, pear, fruits and a doughy quality. So smooth with a nice tickle of carbonation on the toungue. Unbelievably drinkable and a delicious brew."
"Thanks to nacir69 for ascertaining this classic, hard-to-find brew for me!"
"Overall, I was kind of disapointed in this. Is there hype behind this beer? Hell Yes! I have had better dubbels, St. Bernys comes to mind. That said it is very true to the style and a very good beer and well worth a try if you can get your hands on one."
"Drinkability : une très grande bière Trappiste"
"This beer is fitting of the honor of #150. Can't wait for #200 when I will review the ABYSS!!!!"
"Decent drinkable beer, but I'm disappointed. I thought I was going to be blown away. Not the case."
"time when I hardly got a head on the pour. I did not enjoy it as much as the last time though it was just as great except for the more pronounced bitterness."
"Comment: I continue to be amazed at the skills tucked away in far away Belgium. I only wish I had discovered this rare corner of the world thirty years ago. I only hope my wallet can continue to afford me the pleasure of one of the worlds great beers."
"Pours a super dark, rich, amber hue with a big fluffy two finger khaki colored head that slowly dies down. There are some spots in the head that are darker than others, perhaps some sediment I should have let in the bottle. Stickiness is amazing. Holds on to all sides of the glass and doesn't plan on letting go. Smell is a huge dark fruit aroma of mainly dates, plums, and raisins. There's also a sweet molasses scent mixed with brown sugar and a hint of pears. Finally, some fresh honey mixed with a yeasty scent and some caramel malt. Wow, just like its brother Westy 12, complex on the nose. Taste starts off with a spicey sweetness which is followed by the big caramel malt flavor. All of those dark fruits as mentioned before come into play again on the tongue. That's what I like, a beer that lives up to how it smells. I also sense some floral flavors on the tongue as well. Mouthfeel is beyond perfect, if that's possible. So soft, so balanced, so fluffy, so pure. The head lightly flows over the tongue so smoothly, I think I just had a beergasm. I detect no alcohol anywhere with this brew. If God pissed, this would come out. As much as I loved the Westy 12, this easily beats it in my opinion. Perfect 5, you better believe it bitches. I need more of this stuff, NOW!! Greg, hook a brother up!!"
"Very complex and nicely balanced. Hell of a beer. Improves a lot as it warms. Perhaps my expectations were too high, but this wasn't as good as I was expecting."
"Pours a dark cocoa color with a creamy head. The smell is a raisin, creamy malt, sweet sugars, fruity, molasses, its all in there. Taste is dark chocolate, rich malt, cake type flavors (like the 12), with a stronger warming alcohol presence. Slightly less carbonation than the 12. One of my fellow BA buddies said after his second sip... ""Woah, I could drink this all day""."
"The mouth is packed with flavors, some fruits, malt, spice, caramel, the alcohol sneaks in as it warms up more, and has more flavours on the finish, pepper, and the fruits come back to mind. I wish I could drink this everyday but I am glad to have two more in my cellar. They will certainly be enjoyed! A gift from the beer gods."
"Thanks again to my fellow (anonymous) B-A for sharing this fantastic beer. Man, you are excellent!"
"Many thanks to HardTarget for graciously sharing this rare example."
"D- I really like this brew a lot I think this might be one of my favorite dubbels."
"Very nice beer but not as nice as the nose. A little burn in the chest as well even at 8%. Not as complex as the nose but big and meaty nonetheless. Very dry finish with a dried mixed berry end. Again fig and white raisin with hints of mollasses and maple. Nice malty mid palate with dominating toffee and caramel. Dates and prune fill things out and then some more ripe flavors of cherry and red baked apple. Mouth is creamy with moderate carbonation. Very good beer but not as complex in flavor as I anticipated."
"This is a very drinkable and enjoyable beer. I had expected it to be more creamy - but maybe my bottle is pretty fresh and would benefit from more aging."
"Quite honestly, it's currently the best beer I've ever tasted."
"I want to drink a barrel of this beer. Overrated? No."
"Overall, this is like the 12 but with a less pronounced alcoholic aspect. The 8 seemed a bit hoppier too. Great balance again, in depth, strength and length of flavors. Overall, excellent stuff. Thank you monks!"
"An absolute privilege to drink..if you can find this beer, take the time necessary to enjoy every last drop."
"Blue cap, brewed in 2003 and stamped best before November 12/2006...savoured slightly later on May 26 2007. Happy to report while it may not be at it's 'supposed' ""best"" it was still amazing! A dark brown colour with big capping head. Aroma of chocolate covered raisins, dark, ripe fruits, plums, grapes, rich desserts (tiramisu?), and all sorts of things to tickle the imagination. The flavour has become (or maybe always was?) so incredibly mellow! Notes of dates and chocolate covered raisins foremost, with no indication of the alcohol and so rich yet mellowed. This is a beer you could sip and enjoy all night. Tremendous offering. Thanks again Viggo!"
"drinkability is excellent. well balanced and very enjoyable. the alcohol is nearly completely hidden. it's obvious that this is a lighter version of the 12, but it's very nice and good in its own way. huge thanks go out to eric for sharing this gem."
"D: How does this compare to all the dubbels in the world (or beers, period)? I don't know, but I do know this is delicious and a pleasure to drink. It appeals to all the senses and, frankly, I'm glad this one lived up to the hype. Suffice to say, I look forward to the next occasion to share a bottle."
"Malted milk chocolate and caramel notes up front. Slightly rummy fruit notes of raisins and figs develop. Dark candi sugar with a decidedly caramel character swells mid-palate, perfectly so. Slight woody, aged port quality near the finish. Toasty, yeasty, and warming, with lingering caramel and chocolate flavors. An absolutely delicious beer! Full-bodied with rolling, rollicking, bottle-conditioned carbonation that does a great job of lifting the dark sugar sweetness off the palate. Would love to have this readily and easily available. Maybe the best dubbel I have ever had."
"An excellent beer, and a must try for all advocates. I think this beer may be better than the Westy 12. Malty, slight fruit taste, and quite the big beer for the lower alcohol level. I'm sure this beer could be aged for a few years and still be delicious. Medium sized head with great lacing, this beer pours a ruby red, dark colour. I highly recommend this beer. Chris"
"Well done."
"Definitely an exceptional beer and one of the best Belgians I've tried. Glad I got the chance to try it, but I probably won't be having it again unless in Belgium."
"Rather unimpressed with all the hype, but it's still pretty good. The dryness makes it easy to drink despite the alcohol."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied and rather smooth with a fast paced somewhat aggressive carbonation. Quite easy to drink and goes down almost too easily. A tasty treat of a brew and I'm glad to have had the opportunity to try it. I still prefer the 12 and I'm not gonna go out of my way to find this again considering the cost and the trouble involved. If I run across it or find myself in Belgium than that will be a different story :-)."
"The first half of the bottle pours a fairly clear reddish brown. Some floating specks of sediment, but nothing too severe. Tiny bubbles float up regularly. Dense, rocky ivory head. The last bit of the bottle pours like molten chocolate, considerably darkening up the beer, making it entirely opaque. Aroma is rich, with gentle complexity, coming across as honey, almond and apple laying atop a soft, powdered chocolate malt earth. The flavor opens with a surge of carbonation, followed by a dusty, hazelnut-chocolate wash. Muted and glowing brown, like the Belgian artist Rubens' ""Old Woman with a Chafing Dish"". (http://www.abcgallery.com/R/rubens/rubens11.html) Medium bodied, rather sprightly on the palate. Very rounded in texture, providing a full experience. Nutty overall, the chocolate flavor blending masterfully with the yeasty characteristics. Some aged flavors, mostly dusted, papery honey. Works very well with the nutty hazelnut and almond taste. I think I prefer this to the 12. Excellent."
"This bottle was labeled best before 6/8/09 (american style) and we drank it on 3/31/07 to celebrate my girlfriends birthday. I poured it into a Chimay goblet and served it at around 51 degF. It has a thick off white head that sits atop a very dark brown body. It's not black like a stout, but light doesn't get through the sides either. It's kind of weird like that. The aroma is very sweet and malty, but it isn't very strong. The taste is good, but not as good as I had hoped. Granted, my expectations were very high and it still is a good beer. It is very malty and sweet with some dark fruits in there, but there is a slight bite from something in there. The mouthfeel is dead on...perfect full bodied creaminess. The drinkability is also pretty high, although I do prefer the 12 to this."
"Deep brown in color-huge, fluffy tan head. Slight aroma of raisens and dried fruits. Solid malty flavor-trace of roasted malt. Again with the dried fruits. Moderate level of candy like sweetness at times. High level of carbonation makes it very bright on the tongue. Quite dry in the finish. Overall a good beer. I think I preferred the 12. Doesnt live up to the hype for me. I wish it was more readily available and at a better price to really form a solid opinion."
"Poured out a caramel brown color, murky, with a creamy tan head and some minimal sticky lacing. The nose has some toffee sweetness, strawberry, hickory, mollasses, bbq, caramel, banana, and brown sugar. The taste is bananas, anise, chocolate, caramel, alcohol, and yeast. The mouthfeel had some tight prickly carbonation. There's a bit of cloying to an otherwise spectacular finish. My overall impression is that althought this is an amazing beer, it's riding the cotails of the 12 to its high rating."
"Poured from a bottle hand-carried back from the abbey & aged 1 1/2 years. It is a very cloudy orange-tined dark brown with a thin head comprised of microscopic bubbles that create a light tan head & leave beautiful lacing. Smells of oranges, plums, and spices (nutmeg & cloves?). It also has a hint of dark maple syrup lurking in the background. The taste goes through more changes than I can count. Dry cocoa gives way to dark fruits (rum soaked oranges and plums), then a nuttiness that melds into an oak aftertaste, and then a finish like brown sugar. The mouthfeel is chewy and smooth, substantial and lovely. A bit drier at then end than I'd like, if I'm splitting hairs from split hairs. The drinkability is phenomenal, with a warmth that blooms from the alcohol but not a hint of any harshness. In fact, the smooth, melded flavors are the only thing that linger. And they beg to be repeated. Seriously, this one's drinkability is only limited by the lengths to which you have to go to get it. If you can? GET IT!"
"Overall: Thank you so much HimerMan for this unexpected but definately apreciated beer. It was everything I expected and more."
"The feel on this is extrodinary. So alive, it literally is popping in your mouth as you sip. So smooth and the taste just lingers for what seems like an eternity. Simply wonderful. I am glad I picked this up, just at the least to see if it lived upto the hype, and it does! I cannot begin to imagine what the 12 must be like, the one in my fridge will let me know soon enough!"
"Scores high for me with a perfect interaction behind the yeast and malt traditions of a strong Belgum Ale. Like the palate with a smooth delivery but not soft and meaningless. Tones of chocolate. caramel and you name the fuit are a nice dry complement to a beer that continues to deliver in wide temperature range. An absolute top 50 beer."
"Drinkability is about as perfect as a beer gets. This without a doubt is one of my favorite beers. Truly world class. I have had the 12 on two occasions and still think I prefer the 8. I will truly miss having this beer on hand."
"Poured from my bottle to my snifter a dark reddish/brown and unable to see through with a large tan head that leaves some nice lace around the glass. Smell has some fruity notes and the taste is very rich and complex with somewhat dried fruit flavors of raisin and prune and a touch of carbonation. This is one excellently crafted beer and is highly drinkable but only having one small bottle of this brew is not nearly enough time to explore the complexity of this beer."
"Drink-Ability: I am going to go as far as to say this is one of the best beers in the world! I am so happy that I came across this gem and I cant wait to get my hands on this again!"
"Creamy, luscious, delicious. Yes, delicioius. A very broad word used to describe something. Very few things in life can simply be described as delicious. This is one of those special things."
"Overall, an exquisite example of the style. Not just worth seeking out for its reputation, but worth seeking out if only to have a Dubbel like you've never had before. If you see it, trample everyone between you and this brew, you'll thank me."
"D: No doubt about it, this is a wonderful beer. A bit lacking in aroma, but the complexities of the flavor make up for it. I probably won't get out of my way to get this beer again, but if the opportunity is there, I'l gladly take it."
"Used a chalice for this one, as it deserves. Pours a very dark clear amber color, nice carbonation, nice off-white almost 2 finger head which lasts quite awhile, leaves some nice islands and sticky lacing. The nose is of sweet malts, yeast, grapes, figs, raisins, slight caramel. The taste is absolutely delicious of malts/yeast, and grapes. Very tangy, a nice touch of fizzy on the tongue as it goes down, pretty carbonated. Medium body, a very complex brew. Very drinkable, ABV hidden very well, not noticeable in the nose or taste for that matter. Highly recommended."
"Served into a snifter, pours a nice amber-brown, murky with a nice big frothy, tan head. Smells of yeasts, sour, citrus, alcohol, nutmeg, cinnamon, metallic. Tastes of cinnamon, alcohol, some hops, malts, light sugar. Good mouthfeel; nice carbonation and moderatley thick, foam creates nice cream taste. Good in all areas; but lacking on complexity."
"Many, many thanks to bennetj17 and my secret santa for a superb B-day treat! 50? Wish I could have more big uns, when I get to enjoy brews like this."
"Velvetty smooth mouthfeel with an overwhelming sensation of rich ripe fruit that only intensifies in sweetness as this liquid gold warms upon the tongue.	 When aerated across the tongue, sherry notes burst forth along with some subtle tinges of chocolate. This is fantasticly complex, and perhaps the best beer I've ever had the pleasure to grace my lips."
"Pours a dark brown color with a creamy off-white head. The aroma consists of bready malt, cherrries, yeast, spice and brandy. The taste in one word: incredible! There is a really nice malty base that supports some dark fruits and a little chocolate. The taste finishes with a slightly spicey bitterness. Medium mouthfeel is crisp and creamy. Overall, this is truely one of the finest beers on the planet. It definately gets better as it warms so give it time to sit out before serving if serving cold out of the fridge. This beer deserves all the hype and then some."
"This is a wonderful beer that has so much to say. I wish it would say ""hey, I'm cheap and readily available"""
"This one also was sent to me by BA dogfooddog and had a best by date of 18 Feb 2008, making this a little shy of two year old. The beer poured murky orange brown in color, and was topped with a three finger tall head that simply refused to die. Needless to say, the lacing was pretty solid around the entire goblet. Aroma was quite a bit superior to most other Dubbles, which typically underwhelm me with their yeast driven smell. This one seemed much brighter and fruity in comparison. The yeast was certainly detectable in a dusty undercurrent, but the overall smell was not dominated by it. The taste was sweet, sour, bitter, and spicy, but not complex enough to detract from the drinkability. The primary flavor impression was that of dried cherries with a light coating of chocolate. There was spicy bite to the flavor, and surprisingly there seemed to a clean bitterness in the dry finish. Not a hint of the 8% ABV to be found at all. A superlative Dubbel, which has forever ruined the other more typical examples of the style for me."
"Notes: I'd go as far as saying that this is without a doubt one of the best beers on the planet. Truly a masterpiece."
"33 cl bottle shared by the house wine lover himself- I must admit that before we even tried this one, we seriously considered dumping this out, and in its place, pouring Fullers London Porter, mixed with Vodka to create a clone. Then we had an even better idea, why not buy a bottle of La Terrible, and add water to it, to bring the ABV down? Wouldnt it be the same thing? Deep chestnut, pours and emits a thin, tight bubbled beige skin. Apples, plums, prunes, fig, pear, and orages give way to spices (cinnamon) and a mildly smoky malt with subtle hops. Ohh my. Very fruity flavours, that pretty much mimic the aroma, nutmeg and other spices, very earthy and full. Dry, flavourful, lingering finish. Yes, I like it. Thanks Mr.S!"
"Very complex as the proper temperature is everything with this beer. I may have started with this one a little too cold but it really gets better as it warms. Very drinkable but too rare."
"Big full flavored, creamy brew. Tastes changed as I sipped and it warmed. At times, it was just about everything (spicey, sweet, peppery). Well worth having several and very nice."
"Pours a ruddy brown color and murky with a large tan head that barely budges. Aroma is very light and has traces of ripe fruit, sweet caramel malt, and belgian sugars, a little bubble-gummy. Taste shows some of the sweet candy sugar and fruit flavor up front along with a little rich tobacco like flavor, these are cut mid taste by a small roasty twang and a decent pepperiness. There is some alcohol flavor and some tingly carbonation along with the pepper and then a decently dry finish. This beer improved vastly as it approached room temp. The aroma and taste were very subtle and only when it became fairly warm did the flavors start to come out. Still were subtle, but a nice drinkable beer, great mouthfeel."
"Okay, here's the deal. When I first poured this, it was too cold. All the intensity remained, but it was confined. Like seventeen pitbulls in a shoebox, it was confined. Now that's it's warmed, the big fruit yeast of the nose comes in at the start, wonderfully sweet and balanced perfectly against a dryly sweet malt middle and a kick of honest to god hops."
"Drinkability - Hands down one of the most drinkable beers I've ever had. I finished off this bottle in no time. Each sip leaves you yearning for another. Damn near perfect brew."
"D: Quite good considering the strength."
"It is quite obvious that lots of care and skill went into the making of this perfectly balanced ale. Simply the very definition of the style. Worth seeking out. Cheers!"
"D - I want another, but I assume thats the usual feeling. I cant wait to try the 12."
"Drinkability-- goes down easily, except that you are continually grasping to identify the complex flavors. Very drinkable-- if you were fortunate enough to find enough to consume in-quantity."
"jebus. this masterpiece has everything going for it. heavanly mouthfeel, perfect balance and an impossibly light, dry finish. the only thing keeping me from giving this a perfect 5 is probably the same thing that keeps quadrupels and imperial stouts at the top of the best of BA list. 8% abv is nothing to play with, this is a strong ale. but it doesn't quite have the kick your ass wow factor of the biggest and strongest. having said that, this is probably more drinkable and a better everyday beer than the much stronger ales."
"Opinion: What can I say about such an outstanding beer? This is fabulous! As I drink this beer for a while, and I am taking my time with it, I can see how there is often a comparison made between this and Rochefort. This beer does taste a bit like their #8 with all of its fruity complexity and full flavor while still coming across as well attenuated and drinkable. I think that Rochefort is a bit more dark malt driven which gives it a tad more acidity. This beer is a bit more fruity, but both are dangerously drinkable for such strong beers."
"Pours a dark ruby with a amorphous white head. Great lacing/head retention. Aromas quickly filled the room - candied apples, banana, prune, toffee, caramel, even a bit of chocolate. Taste hits strong up front with fruity sweetness and rounds out with the dessert flavors. Mouthfeel is impecable - thick yet effervescent and tingling. Highly drinkable, aside from the difficulty to acquire."
"Pours a lovely deep garnet with a creamy light tan head. With a lot of sticky lace and just a little hazy. Aroma was quite vinous, with a bit of green apple sourness. Lots of caramel and some chocolate surfaced as it warmed. Taste was a roller coaster of flavour, an absolutely amazing ride. Candy apple sweetness and green apples up front, changing to caramel and chocolate maltiness, changing again to a mild bittersweet chocolate peppery finish. Mouthfeel was amazingly smooth and not too heavy, the body of a red wine in a way. This is very drinkable and the flavour is amazing. Definitely something to track down."
"Now I'm just waiting for another special occassion to crack open my first 12. I can respect this brew, and I'll definitely give it a shot again once I age it for a good while. A bit hyped, sure, but I'm not totally against it."
"Cheers!"
"Poured from a label-free bottle with a banded neck, reading ""Trappistenbier."" Different from the photo depicted here. Pours a deep, dark ruby color that is almost opaque until held in the light. The head is absolutely mountainous and a caramel-tan color. It would not die. Hardcore lacing in the chalice. Nose is exceptional - sweet malt, confectioner's sugar, stewed fruits, banana bread ... gorgeous. Palate is quite sweet upfront, but is offset quickly by an almost perfect hop balance. Sweet malts and alcohol are dominent, especially as the beer warms to optimal temperature. Finish is surprisingly dry, thanks to the masterful balance in this beer. Medium mouthfeel and a lingering sugar and alcohol memory in the mouth. An excellent dubbel in every respect. The best of the type I've tried thus far."
"D: Balanced and quite good, but this isn't the #7 beer in the world."
"Creamy and soft, but not too thick. Goes down very smoothly. Along with the Rochefort 10, this is the best beer I've tried. After this, I can't wait to try its big brother."
"Drinkabitly of this beer is great , I expect it to improve with some more age under it."
"D - Drinkability is exceptional. What a wonderful complex beer - one of the best I have had yet. Definitely believe the hype on this one. A special thanks to xcjetta who sent me this beer as part of Secret Santa '05. I have been looking at it for almost 9 months, it was worth the wait!!"
"Finishes with a medium to strong vineosity, with a drying cocoa note and smooth warming on the throat."
"Teh flavor was supprisingly light though it had a gerat mouthfeel, full bodied with just the right amount of carbonation. It had a malty body with a slightly tart finish and some hints of alcohol at teh very end. thi beer put up a great appearance butt eh flavor and aroma somewhat left me feeling let down. it was still quite a good beer and very drnkable, and i would drink it again."
"Beautiful mahogany body with a foamy, off-white head with nice lacing. Smell is dark fruity. Maybe plums. And caramel sugar. Taste is so clean and smooth. It all comes together in this brew. I can't think of how I could make this beer taste any better. Mouthfeel is lighter than I expected and incredibly smooth. Carbonation is almost creamy. Microscopic bubbles. Well hidden alcohol makes drinkability outstanding."
"Sounds like a spikey, exotic, too-sweet beer, right? It's not. It's purely a well-crafted, highly-drinkable, super-enjoyable indulgence for lovers of prime Belgian beercraft. Too bad the monks won't let us enjoy this more often. I respect their ways, but then again, if you've got a great thing going, let the world in on it. No?"
"All the flavors come across as flat and lifeless. There is a cherry and grape flavor but very subdued. Caramel and molasses too--but like they've been in the cupboard for years. Brown sugar, but as if it was mixed and diluted with water. Medium body with some slight heat from the alcohol. Kind of tangy. Alright for what it is, but not sure I understand how it has scored so high."
"Nice creamy and full mouthfeel. Still has some carbonation after 3 years. The finish is divine, and keeps me coming back for more. This is a very drinkable beer, particularly considering the ABV. If it were even the least bit more easily accessable or cheap, I would probably acquire more. I can't wait to finally travel to Europe."
"Overall: A very good and well-balanced beer."
"Mouthfeel is super smooth, rich, and deliciously heavenly."
"M&D: the mouthfeel is superbly creamy and silky smooth, matching the soft body just perfectly. For all the Dubbel-style ales I've tasted, this is by far the most smooth example yet showing impressive complexity and really great flavours. This is not a big beer to make drinkers feel small, but a beer to lift up both their souls and sensations in a subtle manner... Having tried it at last, I think I'll keep my original bottle purchased in Brussels for several more years. I'm sure it'll be even more mature through the test of time~~"
"Cap dated ""16:09:08," no label. Can't tell exactly how old it is."
"A huge thanks to Bruskiator for allowing me to try this one. I belived Bruno picked this up at the brewery in Belgium about 6 years ago. He pulled this one out of his excellent beer cellar for the Carolina Brewmasters BBQ for me and my buddy to experience. My only issue was after lots of beer, BBQ, and sun, I was not able to fully appreciate the taste and mouthfeel as one really needs. Nevertheless, I must let you know this is a beautiful beer, very deep bronze with a pretty fair amount of carbonation. Smelled of wonderful complexity of fruit and chocolate. Just a great way to top off last night."
"I only have one though, and it's gone."
"Cheers."
"I think the only comparable beer per style in quality at this age is Rochefort 8. It is a masterpiece and should be bought on sight."
"Very well done. I liked the pastry ideas here, like in the 12, but the dryness tragically (I use this term relatively) stole the show. Thanks to blitheringidiot for this one."
"This may be the best dark malty beer in Belgium. Creamy smooth and with enough punch to hit you after you've decided to stand up from the bar or table. Excellent with cheese and the foamy Belgian lace and sweet aroma make this another outstanding Westvletern product. Get some if you can find it."
"Rich and full in body, not overly thick, but creamy enough to make it highly enjoyable. Fairly high in carbonation, it makes me let out a joyous belch after the first few sips. Drinkablility of this beer is off the charts. Not too strong, complex flavors, probably the best Dubbel I've ever had, as expected..."
" Tastes damn good. The flavors are layered and seem to repeat. Slightly fruity, some yeast, spice, and hops. Mouthfeel is full, well carbonated, but smooth. I would drink dubbels more often if I could buy this. At least I have 1 more."
"I believe that this has held up to the legendary status surrounding it. Best before date on the cap read,"18-02-09"". It poured about like any other dubbel. It appeared very slightly cloudy reddish rusty brown colour with a monster khaki coloured head. Craggy, pitted foam left lots of sticky lacing on the edges of my Konings Hoeven goblet. The smell? Unimaginable! Spice, banana bread, cherries, pumpkin pie, pizza dough. Absolutely amazing, and it didn't stop there as much of this carried over to the taste, as well. Lots of fruit on the palate, as well as yeasty dough. The mouthfeel was almost velvety as this silky dubel washes over your tongue and down the back of your throat. I don't want to say that it seemed oily, as that would sound offensive, but that is how easily and gracefully it seemed to glide about my mouth as I savoured and swallowed each sip. Even at 8% and to be a dubbel, I'm quite sure that I could have 3 of these in a sitting. I was a bit skeptical at first as to whether or not this legendary ale would live up to all it has become through all the hype surrounding it. I think the answer to that question is certainly ""yes""."
"This beer poured an opaque, brown color with creamy, light brown foam that was slow to settle and clung to the glass, coating it. The smell was modest, but some malt came through. The taste was fruity and vinous, almost like blueberries (!). The light fruitiness was up front but the finish was dry with some hops coming through the malt. The mouthfeel was smooth and dry overall with medium body and strong carbonation. A very nice mouthfeel. This was a very nice bottle, and probably the freshest I have had this beer. The only weak point was the aroma."
"With everything this beer has going for it, the drinkablity is a five. No doubt about that. Again, I'm in awe of what the brothers can do."
"it's no 12, but it's a solid beer wrapped in an exquisite package. worth a try, glad i did."
"The appearance is dark with a little light shinning through. The aromas are fruity and fruity that is all you smell. At a young age this is a excellent beer but age it atleast a year to enhance the flavors. At the young age it has a good fruity flavor but after a year this flavor is unbelievable, I first thought that it was not worth the drive across Belgium but now after tasting a couple more can't wait to go back. The mouthfeel is smooth with an abundance of flavor, the only thing I marked it down on was the drinkability due to the fact that it is packed full of flavors, to much of this wonderful brew and you will give yourself a headache enjoying every sip. But it is the only way to drink this beer. ENJOY"
"I had that beer in my cellar since a year in a half waiting to drink it, I guess I was disapointed, I was waiting for the Holy Grail. A very good beer, not a great one to jump out of building tho"
"Best Dubbel I've ever had."
"more tart, almost sour apples in the flavor. bready malts and a crisp, dry, champagne-like feel. alcohol and sour in the finish, which is a touch unpleasant. surprisingly straightforward, as i've come to expect a lot more complexity from the trappists. then again, i far prefer the rochefort 10 to the 8 or 6; maybe the westvleteren 12 will also far exceed its lesser brethren."
"THE BLOODHOUND FACTOR: Yes, I shared this heavenly brew with my angelic pups. They both were thrilled with it, even though they got little more than a cap ful."
"Bottle Pours a clear brown with a light tan and fizzy head. The head lasts a good while, but doesnt lace all that well. Aromas are sweet with touches of raisins, plums, and a touch of cherry. Has a strong alcohol presence. Taste is very refined with a great mix. This is not real sweet or bitter or malty, just has a pure beer taste. A very crisp refreshing beer. No real noticable aftertaste but it has a solid duration. Definately as good as advertised."
"I think that I might just like this one a touch more than the 12. The 8 has lighter aromas and flavors, a softer body and a lighter palate. The reduced alcohol gives the beer a less vinous character, which allows more delicate components of the nose and tongue to shine through. This is certainly more subtle but I dont think its lacking anything significant on the 12. Its just a different beer. One item that I must note is the body. IN addition to being generally softer, the 8 seems to be considerably more bubbly. The head is slightly more aggressive on the lips and tongue and the more assertive carbonation seems to do a better job of cleansing the palate between sips. Each next sip, is therefore closer resembling the original, full flavored, mind blowing sip. I like this about the beer. I also like that it looks, tastes, and smells just uncannily good and also that its damn near impossible to find. What a treat it is and well worth every penny, or couple thousand pennies that one must drop to get a bottle."
"Bottom line: This is one classy and classic brew. If you ever see some around your neck of the woods, do not fail to grab some and if you can't find any locally, try your best to arrange for a trade or buy some online. It's too good to miss out on!!"
"Body is right between medium and large with a chewy, sticky mouthfeel and creamy soft texture. Nectar of the Gods this is!"
"poured a deep brownish-red color with chunky, slightly off-white head. Little retention but nice subtle lacing on the side of the glass. Smell is absolutely fantastic, being a nice combination of dark fruits (raisins, prunes, figs, dates), tart apples, and wine. Very unique and supremely enjoyable. The taste is a culmination of the promise of the smell. What a mixture of spiciness, fruitiness, and toasty malt. It virtually dances in the mouth. Finish is so smooth that its difficult to believe there is 8% alcohol in it. Some wine-like flavors come through at the end. Easy to drink. Will try to find another bottle some time."
"This is definitely a drinkable beer that I would like to have another of really soon. I think I will."
"Drinkability- By far the most flavorful dubbel I have tried. I usually am not really a fan of dubbel's, but this one I would gladly drink all the time if it was readily available. Highly recommended."
"This beer pours a dark brown and leaves a 1/2in tan head. The smell is sweet fruits figs, plums, grape juice and honey. As I tasted this beer all the previous fruit flavors come out this has a great malty taste on the palate and is really smooth. As I let this beer continue to warm up I can really begin to smell and taste more of the fruitiness as well as the honey and cloves and it just compliments each other so well. This is one of the best beers I have ever had, it is well crafted and would pair well with some smoked gouda or any antipasto dish to really contrast against the sweetness of the beer."
"Drinkability: High alcohol inhibits session drinkability, but the brew is delicious (not as good as the 12, but close)."
"There is a fair amount of carbonation. Overall, this is a very nice dubbel. Would most likely be a good beer to cellar and let its character come through. Glad I have some more."
"Drinkability is very high. all Dubbels should be this graceful yet powerful, still the standard bearer for the style."
"An entirely worthy beer for my 100th review, I just hope my review is worthy of the beer. A shame this can't be (legally) purchased in the US anymore."
"overall: this is a very good dubbel. ranked as the number 5 beer in the world, i had quite high expectations. as good as this was, i was still hoping for a little more. i have two more that i'll have over the next two years. this brew is prime for maturation."
"Pours a very deep brown color with ruby hues. A two finger head sits over top and falls to a finger. The nose is brown sugary and even slightly mapel-like. Sweet dark fruits with puffs of alcohol abound. I even get a touch of cherry in there too. Very nice. Flavor is oh so nice. A ton going on here. Light dark fruits, caramel, brown sugar, slightly creamy. Shit. So smooth. This may be the best brew I have had. Hands down. The feel is velvet smooth with a very fine carbonation. Its moderate in thickness. I could sit and drink this brew all damn day. No hint anywhere of the 8%. Everything moves seamlessly into each other in the flavor, aroma and mouthfeel. Divine. Absolutely divine"
"Pours a very murkey iced tea brown/orange, lots of fine chunkies, perfect light brown head forms, settles in a ring around the glass. Smell is very vinous, sweet honey like aroma, chocolate, and dark cherries. Taste is alcohol and chocolate up front, rich malty middle, dark cherries, some grassiness/hay and a rich bitter finish. Mouthfeel is like butter, medium bodies, perfect carbonation, just slides down your throat. Excellent beer, as good in its own ways as Westy 12, and I'm glad I have another bottles kicking around."
"D- This is a nice complex beer in the smell but it just doesn't have the same complexity in the taste. Very nice beer."
"Notes: This was the first time I tried Westvleteren 8. I set up a side-by-side comparison with St. Bernardus Prior 8 (served in another Watou chalice from an 11.2 oz bottle). The Prior 8 has been one of my favorites since I first tried it last December. Now I can happily say that I think it is marginally better than Westvleteren in my opinion. They are both exceptional, but the alcohol was just more present in the Westvleteren flavor than I would prefer. The St Bernardus seemed a little richer in malt flavor also."
"Pours a dark brown, slightly crimson color, with a tan, creamy looking head and some lacing. Smells mostly of raisins, a sweet, and lightly floral backgrounds. As it warms, I get more powerful raisiny smells. Taste is also quite raisiny, with hints of chocolate, coffee, and toffee- a stouty type thing going on. Very dry. Can't sense the alcohol at all, very sneaky. Mouthfeel is smooth and chewy and frothy- very nice. Drinkable, sure, to some extent- but I find there's something in there that would prevent me from being able to have a few of these. A solid beer to be sure, but I hope I can get another one and hold on to it for a few years..."
"The taste is much more dry than the smell indicates, though there is a sweetness... like sweetend coffee.... perhaps coffee with a splash of raisin syrup. There's also a stouty/coffee like thing in the mouthfeel. Can't really detect the alcohol in the flavor, though I imagine it serves to liven up flavors.Very complex. This isn't my favorite dubbel out there but it's nothing to sneeze at."
"Conclusion: Very 'dubbel'-like in character. It's a good and solid beer, but world class? Meh."
"A very drinkable brew. You'd guess it was only 5% ABV. These people obviously know what they're doing. Respect."
"Final thoughts: an excellent brew but don't fall prey to ""you can't find it, it is sooo good."" There are other dubbels out there that will keep you happy."
"A shame that it cost so much, as I would have loved to drink the 2nd bottle, but I'll save it for a little cellaring and drinking later."
":) Fantastic...i prefer this over the 12 actually"
"Superb!"
"Drinkability... well, DAMN hard to find, and a little too rich for session drinking... but would I have another if the opportunity arose? HELL YES!"
"I would buy again if I saw it for sure!"
"Raisin brown with a thin, dingy beige head that coats the beer to the end. Aroma is of fruity esters, vinous, sugary sweetness and tart green apples. Nice rich caramel sweetness that grows as the beer warms. The nose is infinitely complex with various intertwining aromas. Grainy and grassy malt flavor with a bit of sugary sweetness, but not as much as in the nose. Some spicy, peppery hops mixed with some tarness and a very soft, lingering vinous quality that is especially evident in the finish. Mouthfeel is soft and pleasant with some mild carbonation tickle. Overall, vinous and dry. A little sweetness could go a long way."
"As I did Westvleteren 12 as a landmark beer, so am I doing Westy 8 as review #700. I bought this almost a year ago, so it's had a good year to age a bit, and I like the results. As a nice dubbel, this is a fine one, with a good plum-like sweetness in the body that's just barely touched by hops, and a candi sugar sweetness and a tartness that completes the complexity of the beer. Quite nice, a fine beer, and now that the flow of these bottles are slowing down a bit, I'm glad to have had the chance to have this before Westvleteren is cut off to the US."
"Taste starts with alcohol (damn, and I cellared this in hopes of clearing that up a bit) that settles to caramel and toffee. Some phenolic funk (appropriate for the style, but, yuck, I don't like funk). Fortunately, the funk is covered pretty well by candi-sugar. Licorice and black anise beneath and a still present gentle alcohol burn. What a great aftertaste. Yummy chocolate that settles to a delicate alcohol prickle on the back of my and and far back on the roof of my mouth. More tastes reveal, not quite a molasses, but more of a brown sugar. Alcohol mixed with this has a sort of brandy character. Md-thick body and a bit over-carbonated."
"Purply brown cloudy opaque Dubbel with a monster head and lots o lacing. Smell, especially as the beer warms, is a heady complex mixture of fruit (pear, raisin, and some banana) and Belgian yeast and malts. It was a shame to consume it and lose that aroma. Taste is mellow fruity candi mix of bubbly goodness. Mouthfeel is medium full and very satisfying. If this beer were reasonably available and reasonably priced, it would be a permanent fixture in the household."
"Very drinkable. Worth the cost ? Yeah, sure."
"How wonderful that such a little piece of Belgian culture can find its way all the back to Alaska and be enjoyed with almost as much splendor as when it was had at De Vrede."
"But in any case, two great beers."
"Over the last serveral months my tastes have changed, my nose has yet to pick up all that passes it and my palate follows suit, but overall this beer is sheer nirvana. There are some just as good, the Rochfort 8 which I am openning now may be one of them, the unibrue 11 which I finished earlier is close with its hit of plum but this beer is a punch in the mouth and all I can say is how on earth do they do it. Enough has been written about each of our experiences our tastes. Overall I get Plum with a hint of alcohol like plum wine yet subtle, nice bubbles with a short creamy head, a very very subtle brandy aroma and somthing sweet that stays on my palate like syrup, delicious beer may I have another please?"
"drinkability is fantastic, one of the best beers I've ever had.I obtained this thru a trade, along with the 12, this is the 1st one I've tried, and well worth it, excellent!"
"This is a beautiful looking beer  alive, with a rich dark red color and a wonderful nose that makes your mouth water. On the pour it left a dark dollop in the center of sediment. Oh what a great first taste  so silky like it was on nitrogen. The alcohol is clear and present and leaves a lasting burn as the sweet honey bitter chocolate and dry hop flavors linger on your palate. This beer is a world class and fully satisfying in one glass. Block out an hour of your life and enjoy. Get it at Jackson's in Lafayette."
"Medium bodied and quite dry, very drinkable."
"Drinkability and Overall: Well wouldn't you know it. This is damn near as good as the 12, if not better. It's smoother and more balanced, while not quite as complex. This beer is truly one of the world's best. Westvletern is the best of the Trappist breweries I've tried. The balance and complexity they achieve is unmatched by any other beer on the market. This is a remarkably smooth, tasty, complex, and delicate beer, that is perfect for any occassion. One of the world's best."
"CHEERS! Beertracker"
"A dark, rich, malty, Strong ale. Drink what you will, saver the rest, Enjoy thoroughly"
"I have been waiting to try this for a while for some reason. Since having other dubbels recently I decided to see how this stacked up. The pours out a dark ruddy brown with a few bits of sediment floating about. About an inch of frothy tan head foams on tap that stays for some time leaving little bits of lacing around the glass. Aroma is strong with rip dark fruits and an underlying sweetness. There is a bit of candy like sugar to it and a good amount of spice. Very appetizing aroma you could sit and sniff for awhile. Sweet malt and a bit of sugar start off the flavor. A bit hit of dark fruitiness really carries the taste. A nice variety of spice it there as well. This ends on a spicy fruity note. Very flavorful and not to sweet. Just about full bodies this is as smooth and creamy as it gets. Simply marvelous feel to it. Insane drinkability as well, which could be a bad thing since it led me to drink it quicker than expected. A must try if you like dubbels."
"Pours dark brown with an exeptional head filled with hills and valleys. The aroma is the most remarkable I've experienced: very earthy, brown sugar and cinammon (?). The flavor starts out a little boozy, but mellows once it aerates: cinammon, apple, pepper, brown sugar, butter and oolong tea with musty hints. The bouquet seems to fluctuate between a almost cleansing edge.The booze numbs the tongue, but oddly this one is far from a palate killer. I'm deducting the drinkability .5 just because I don't think this one is perfect, but it is damn near it."
"Drinkability: This Blue Cap is similar to the yellow cap, however it is more balanced and less sweet."
"This pours out a cloudy dark mahogany. The head is stiff and leaves a nice lacing around the edge of the glass. Aroma is sweet at first. Upon further smelling, numerous fruits show up in the malt profile with yeasty esters providing a very complex aroma. Grape juice and a whif of alcohol round out the aroma. The taste is right up there with the aroma. It is smooth, complex. I seem to find something different in every sip with vinous fruits dominating. This is one tasty brew. Mouthfeel is chewy at first, but finishes dry leaving a nice fruity aftertaste. Drinkability is insanely good for a beer this potent."
" First sip is suprisingly banal; maybe the hype had skewed my expectations. A bready, malty taste with a hint of alchohol and good hop balance. I served the beer too cold, but as I warmed the goblet with my hands the flavor profiles did come out more, again a wonderful malty blance with hint of raisins and alchohol. I found the balance to be wonderful and suprisingly the aftertaste to also be exceptional, the actual taste seemed a tad flat. Please understand this is an exceptional beer. I honestly have enjoyed others more, the St. Bernardus Pater 6 that I've had I think is superior. I also enjoyed the Chimay I had during the post-game chat more(Chimay blue). Still this is definitely damm good. I will try this beer again, but I will wait till I visit the monks in person, God willing, down the long beer -drinking road."
"Overall, I really enjoy this, and am glad to have tried it. But to be honest, I don't get the hype. This is good, but a few others are equally good or better, in my humble opinion."
"Perhaps the most ringing endorsement: My non-BA buddy was with me, and said ""I don't really like Belgian beers," then took a sip and said, ""This is undoubtedly the best Belgian beer I've ever had."" Word."
"Beer is good. Happy beering."
"-Dating 04-03-07. Dark rootbeery brown with a ton of huge, frothy, khaki head that finally reduced down to a thick ring at the edges. Saison scents in the spiciness. Banana, oranges, and cherries. So nice and dry. Smooth and creamy, but not heavy. Medium maybe. Carbination is present but not overwhelming. Can feel and taste the alcohol, very nice, I enjoy that. Tastes of vanilla and dark fruits, but not sweet. The Blithering one said he tastes almond extract, yep, you can sooo get that, and once you do, that is mostly what you taste. Can smell the almond a ton at the end. The flavors are good in this one, I find it much more enjoyable than the 6. Could djoy a few of these in a sitting quite easily."
"Not quite a religious experience of a beer... just profound enough to have me licking the insides of my empty glass."
"It sits a clear dark brown in the glass with a lacy head about 1 cm thick on top. The aroma is malty with a bit of salty sweetness. The flavors open with a grand entrance of brown sugar, carrot, and smokiness. The middle is dominated by caramel, toffee, and slight fruit flavors. The beer has a magnificently spicy end. This is by all means an excellent beer."
"Overall an outstanding beer."
"postscript - I must mention a phrase coined by a friend upon tasting this beer for the first time: ""...a freight train of flavor"""
"wooha, the good stuff! What can be said about the worlds best dubble (according to hundreds of BAs) that hasnt allready been said. What strikes me is the softness and smoothness of the mouthfeel. The subtleness of the cocoa and powdered sugar in the nose. The classic and impressive sheets of lace. The complexity of the flavor profile. The layers of flavors. Vanilla, cocoa, chocolate, rum, dark berries etc. Alot going on here. Buy this stuff. Enjoy"
"50 cl bottle. Date code on cap 26.11.03. Price of $7.50 still on bottle. This one is still pricey, but beginning to become well worth the price of admission to see the show."
"Foam keeps for ever though and the nose is litle hoppy and malty but more than that fruity( apricot like). Taste is full malty followed by fruit and ending very bitter and dry. One of my favorites!"
"I love it."
"Many thanks to Brother Stonecrusher for enlightening a simple backwoods Texan."
"Bottle tasted from case bought on 1/1/02. Reddish brown in color with an off white head. Lots of particles. Aromas of dark fruits (plums & raisins), spices, dough, caramel and slight yeast. Mmmm, nice smelling. Tastes are just as complex, if not better, than the smells. Great tasting beer. Alcohol content hidden. Lively carbonation. This is a very good beer - one of my favorites (Im glad I still have 12 in the cellar)."
"Is Westvleteren 8 better than Westvleteren 12? My vote is an unqualified 'yes'. I could drink this every day for the rest of my life and not tire of its myriad charms. This is as soul satisfying and as life affirming as beer gets."
"This bottle was aged in Malto's cellar and I believe the age gave this beer an amazing smoothness combined with a chocolate flavour that put me into orbit. I didn't expect the chocolate notes but they were somehow perfect complements to the dark esters and old fruit buried in the body. A truly great beer experience."
"Best before date of 31.01.06 stamped on the bottle cap. Purchased in Iowa City, IA for $9.00."
"From the first whiff, it's evident this is unique. A spicy conglomoraton of cinnamon, ground cardamom, Dr. Pepper, Raisinets, and Kahlua. Such intensity! Where the chocolate was obscure and more a ghost than a reality, coccoa powder dominates the flavor and texture of this beer. Abrasive carbonation and chocolate literally give the sensation of licking pure chocolate powder. Brown sugar. Bits of alcohol. And then there's tree bark or cracked peanut shells -- whatever it is, there's a natural, raw character to this beer despite its upbeat aroma. One of the best beers I've ever tasted."
"Murky, rusty-brown body and a large, relentless, soft ripply beige head. Very rich, malty aroma - almost wortlike. Specific aroma notes include buttery roasted nuts, burnt caramel, barnyard and earth. Rich malty flavor followed by some very nice late bitterness. Also has a woody flavor and texture even. Mouthfeel struck me as a little chalky at first but that sensation subsided and gave way to a nice, big, smooth palate. Great stuff indeed. I wouldn't have pegged this as a dubbel."
"Looks just like it's big brother the 12%'er. The smell is more faint though meaning you can pick out more subtle smells, vanilla and raisin, chocolate raspberries, and a Vienna style smell. Flavors are just as many with toasted almond, vanilla, medium alcohol, overall has a much better balance than the 12%. Finish is of chocolate and coffee, reminds me of a fullers London porter in flavor and mouth feel. Overall much better than the 12% alcohol version, balance is much better."
"Pours opaque deep brown with orange hints. Head is first rather large, off-white, well-laced, but diminishes to a thin cover. Sediments are dancing all over the glass. Aroma is an explosive fruity malt and yeast meadow. Tangy fruits are chewy (bubble gum, plums, pears, dates, banana, grapes, watermelon, grapefruit.. name it you have it). Huge malt hides smoky suggestions. Monstruous house yeast offers those chocolate bread characteristics a plenty. Enough complexity to lose yourself in. Incredible smooth rounded mouthfeel, silky texture, easy 5. Contemplative dry balancing bitter finish is very long and bear a small warming alcohol hint. Very worthy, I may prefer it to the 12, it seems better balanced(a bit less yeasty and less fruit juice like), but it could just be lighter. I owe it to myself to compare both side by side someday."
"Two words: Liquid Orgasm."
"This is non-Grand Cru Grand Cru."
"Taste is sweet initially, with fruity notes, and then takes on a tart character. Mouthfeel is great, creamy and smooth, and drinkability is excellent, as you'd have to sit and drink a few before nailing down everything that's going on for the senses. Unfortunately, not so easy to find to have that many on hand, so this one bottle's review will have to do for now. Worth the search to enjoy..."
"An interesting beer with a nice warming sensation and some relatively complex attributes. Lighter tan I had expected and surprisingly tart. Temperature should be over 60f."
"Wow. Why did I wait so long to buy this? Pours a murky ruby with a huge rocky tan/brown head, that remains as a sticky lace. Aroma is of granny smiths, phenol, and some maltiness. First let me tell you about the mouthfeel: out of this world smooth medium body, with a touch of prickliness. Bitterness, phenols, and fruitiness present themselves as flavours. Toasted grains and molasses for malts. This is one of the best beers I've experienced, but unfortunately it loses points in drinkability due to price: $9.00 per bottle. Nice for a treat every once in a while."
"Clear, deep burgandy tone. Nicely whipped head of light beige froth adorns the surface and has great retention and lacing ability. Initial blast of alcohol on the nostrils subsides as the sweet bubblegum and rock candy notes take over. There's also a raisiny, rummy characteristic on the nose. Very nice aroma. The flavors are complex, yet subdued. A graceful profile of dates, figs, plums, raisins, bubblegum, rum, toffee and chocolate. A spicy, alcoholic bitterness resides on the tongue after the swallow and detracts just a little from the overall drinking experience. Mouthfeel is light and airy. It almost melts in the mouth like cotton candy. Carbonation is appropriate. Good dubbel."
"Bottle dated 090902, courtesy of Unionmade, thanks! Pours into my glass a surprisingly clear medium shoe polish brown color, gushing with effervescent foam that quicky sizzles off leaving only a faint glaze of foam to stay. Aroma is very aged fruity, reminiscent of an English vintage ale, Fuller's comes to mind. Lots of plum, apple, and raisin in the nose along with a tantalizing caramely malt sweetness. First thing I notice upon tasting is again the carbonation, there's way to much fizz, seems to be overpowering some of the beer flavor. I actually found this beer to be much better on the second day when I was finishing the last bit in the bottle from the night before. Flavor has lots of complexity, I'm at first assaulted with brandied fuit, then some toasted malt blends easily into the fray. Finish has a nice tight bitterness that I didn't expect and definitely some alcohol warmth is noticeable. I don't think the flavor quite lived up to the nose, but it's tasty. Body is on the lighter side of medium. As the beer warms closer to room temperature, it seems to gain a lot more depth and charachter that wasn't evident when chilled, with more sweetness and maybe a hint of oak coming through. This is a respectable beer, definiely worth trying."
"Became easier and easier to drink as I drank. Dang good beer!"
"Drinkability is a masterpiece of a sippers brew! This cost $7 for one small bottle for a REASON!"
"My expectations were probably unrealistically high and this falls short of what I expected...still damn good but for $8 for an 11 ounce bottle I'll pass in the future...too many other great beers...."
"This beer is positively delicious. It has all the characteristics of a good dubbel but it isn't too heavy. The alcohol is there but not overbearing. The color of the beer is a deep amber/brown with a lovely tan head. A perfect pour generates the proper amount of head on the beer, and it has a good bit of carbonation to it. Upon first sip, the flavors are rich with a hint of fruitiness. There is a slightly bitter aftertaste that follows. Midway through the glass, the head is still there. Ohh this beer goes down easy."
"Pours out a slightly hazy dark brown with a full light tan head. Good balance in flavor. Complex and getting better as the beer warms up a bit. Fruityness is there, but not overstated. Spiced flavors blend in well with the overall profile. Hop flavors are around, but remain in the background. A solid beer, but nowhere near the beer that the 12 is."
"Auburn colour, bergundy in some light. Vanilla, fruit, yeast and malts. Mouthwarming sizzling carbonation with light-medium texture. Spice and dried fruit, bannana with raisin, carmel . Bit acidic. Great by itself and as appetizer, but beware that the alcohol is there. Deserves its rich reputation."
"ng"
"This beer poured a dark tan color with a light tan head that quickly disappeared. Taste was very winish, raisins, slight nutty and malty flavor to it. A very good brew, however I feel the 12 is slightly better. I really dig what those Monks at Westveleteren are doing."
"Drinkability is superb, as the alcohol is buried deeply in the complexity of flavors. This is certainly a Belgian classic, but at over $8 a bottle, I would prefer its big brother, Westy 10."
"Overall, a good beer, but I was disappointed as I was expecting so much more."
"I'd drink it everyday if I could. Taste belies it's ABV."
"Bottle: Poured a dark brown beer with a huge head with excellent retention. Aroma is quite sweet with some great mix of spice and malts. Taste is sweet with what seems like a mix between candi sugar and plum with some added roastiness. Great carbonation and alcohol is very subtle. Overall, this is way better Westmalle Dubbel and probably one of the Belgian Ale I appreciated the most."
"The taste develops the very enjoyable bread aspect that appeared in the smell: the bread just melts in the mouth. Dark malts create a great flavor, which has some light raisin and winy notes, and maybe a hint of licorice. The hops are hidden and take time to appear. They combine harmoniously with the malts to create a very full, round and complex mouthfeel: thick but not chewy, hoppy but not bitter. Such a pleasure in the mouth."
"this one went down amazingly smooth and if it was not as expensive as it is i would buy this over and over again. outstanding. IMHO this one is defintiely better then the westy 12"
"I personally enjoyed this more than Westy 12. It paired perfectly with the first fresh homemade applesauce of the season!"
"I cannot wait to find out."
"Finally a chance to get my hands on a Westy and well not as awed as many others by this beer.Pours a deep brown almost black color with a fizzy head that didnt stick around to long,aroma of spiced apples and quite yeasty.Very raisiny and somewhat spicey up front, with a light medicinal note as it warms along with some alcohol tones.I highly anticipated this beer and was left a little dissapointed."
"I'm glad I tried the 8 before the 12 because I am ready for that 12."
"A caught a whiff of apples at the bottleneck on opening my 11.2oz bottle. It threatened to foam up too much, so I poured it gently. It's an earthy brown with a small head of fine bubbles that clings to the glass. The aroma is extremely fruity. Not floral hoppy. Plum, apples, cinnamon? On first taste, I have to get past the significant carbonation. Then I'm thinking of wine, maybe plum wine. Then chocolate. It gets dry and spicy towards the end. Subtle warmth at the end, way less so than Westy 12. Full bodied. So smooth."
"So I will."
"Quite enjoyable. I just sat back in the sun with the glass to my nose, taking an occasional sip and relishing each one. A wondrous dubbel that sets the standard for the style, IMO."
"Kind of a hefty price tag but it's worth it to finally have Westy available in my area. I tried the Westy 12 almost 2 years ago by trading and didn't really have the palate to appreciate it at the time. This being the 12's little sibling maybe I should have tried this one first. Pours a deep mahogany color with a very thick and creamy light beige head. The foam actually threatened to escape the bottle immediately after opening. The aroma is a nice bouquet of fruit, spice and sweet malt. Rich bodied and on the carbonated side, with a mild blend of dark fruit, malt, caramel, spice and a hint of sweet chocolate. None of the flavors really stands out, instead it is a nice harmony of flavors. The finish is very crisp and lively on the tongue. The flavor is a little more subdued in the finish, but this is still a well-rounded and exemplary Belgian."
"The taste and mouthfeel are simply luxurious.full, sensuous maltiness. Just the right balance of alcohol and mild, subtle hops. Spice and alcohol in the mid-taste. I love how the taste seems to bring out more aromas.sip, smell and repeat through the entire glass. Finish has a lingering spiciness and is incredibly smooth."
"Drinkability: A rather enjoyable and well-made little brew. The anise flavors come close to overpowering the flavor profile, but thankfully back away at the last minute. I could see myself having a few more of these were it not for the pricetag."
"Was able to get this nice brew courtesy of Gusler, Thanks!"
"Very easy to drink, though I think this beer needs some aging. My bottle was 6 months old and still required some settling and concentrating (felt the same way about their 12, too)."
"Definetly one of the best beers I have ever tried. To my luck, though, I still have the '12' on standby--not for long."
"Turbid brown with orangy-copper highlights underneath a nice thicket of beige colored head. Good lacing and healthy carbonation (I've experienced a flat bottle before, kind of a bummer when forking over $10 for one beer). Lots of protein coagulation and yeast in suspension (consistent with some trappists). Aroma is outstanding. Healthy aroma of dark candi sugar, yeast, dark fruits like candied figs and dates, expensive chocolate, hops, peat or dirt, and, strangely enough, botanical, like a humid greenhouse. It gets even more complex after that. It's rather difficult to describe the taste, a lot going on at once and in singularity. Kilned candi sugar is obvious. Cocoa, toffee, sugarplum, maple, cardboard, dark chocolate with a slight touch of anise and ginger to ""round it out"". Silky, effervescent and smooth. If I were rich, I'd have a stockpile of it."
"Served at about 55F in a Westy silver-rimmed glass. It pours a deep and dark mahogany with a substantial beige head and some trailing, sliding and sticky lace. Sweet malt, fruit soaked in rum, hops, yeast and a mild pine scent make up the complex aroma. The lightly herbal malt features caramel and candy sugar sweetness in a rich velvety, nearly oily body. Beautiful symphonies of flavors mingle and harmonize. Ripe banana, plums, vanilla, fruitcake, coriander and cloves vie for attention within the dark rum-like warming alcohol background. Piney esters and an ever so slightly camphor astringency provide more interesting tastes. This wonderful brew pairs nicely with Molanari salami and Cabot Vintage Cheddar, and as can be imagined, any gourmet offering. Pure bliss!"
"Picked up a bottle of this knowing it is usually the top of the BA list - and now I can see why: perfect balance between the malt and hops - with a very agreeable if understated finish. The flavors are simple, clean and elegant, much like the design on the bottle. The 8% abv is very well hidden, though this ale provides a very calming, warming quality that is very agreeable. Outstanding and very highly recommended."
"Another heavenly (sorry) libation by those monk-type people!"
"I found this beer very drinkable. Good sipping beer if you don't mind swinging the price for such a small quantity. Maybe I need to look around and find it cheaper, I certainly would love to have it again."
"Pours a hazy chestnut with a persistent 1 finger beige head that leaves behind patches of lace. Aroma is musty with notes of caramel, chocolate, dates, and some herbal notes. Flavor is equally complex, with a slightly sweet start, some notes of toffee, dates, chocolate, musty yeast, some unidentifiable spiciness, and a lingering herbal bitterness in the finish. Moutfeel is smooth and medium bodied. Utterly drinkable, especially considering the high ABV % of this beer. This is a true gem!"
"Bottle Dated 31-01-06 This one poured cloudy and dark brown with a big frothy tan head and light lacing. The aroma is similar to the Westy12, spicy with fruit notes and a little yeast showing up as well. The mouthfeel here differs though and I found it to be more of a Tripel like mouthfeel. Very effervescent and crisp. Unfortunately this does not have the big flavors of the 12. Actually a bit bland in comparison. Still a decent ale with a good malty body and a subtle spiciness."
"Cloudy, dark chocolate colored beer topped by a thick head that looks like spray-foam insulation. Aroma of plums smothered in dark chocolate, with a hint of bready yeast and a slight spiciness. Complex yet clean. Surprisingly, there is a noticeable bitterness in the flavor. A sweet malt and alcohol backdrop support the fruity notes and a decent amount of phenols. Lingering bitterness with a slight sugary sweetness. The mouthfeel is decent, but perhaps a bit on the thin side. Drinkability is good, although I'm not sure I'd want to drink this one very often. This is a decent beer, but there are many, many better in my opinion. This one's pretty to look at, but nothing special to imbibe. So let's see, a bottle of this or a sixer of SNCA? This will stay on the shelf almost every time."
"Alright, this one was incredible! Great dark red-brown/burgundy colour, very pretty. It smelled fruity and spicy- like cinnamon/nutmeg dusted apples perhaps.. It tasted a thousand times more than it smelled. I looked at my boyfriend and said with wide eyes it's like those red spiced apple rings! But better! That is the best way I could describe the taste- red spiced apple rings. Mouthfeel was perfect and drinkability is therefore great. I can't wait til I can afford to get this again.... yes I only bought 1 bottle but it's still a bit too pricy to get too often. For now the experience lingers in my mind...."
"Medium brown color. Medium white head. Aroma is malty, bananas and bready yeasts. A medium bodied Belgian Strong Ale. Malts are fruity and complex; oranges, plums and banana flavors compete with bready yeasts. Rich complex flavor. Very smooth. The flavors improve and the beers mellow as it warms. It much better at 68 degrees that 58. This is a nice beer, very drinkable. But the 12 is so...much better. Very drinkable and worth trying. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly sweet."
"All other Trappist offerings fail in comparison to this one for me. Brilliant beer and worth every penny."
"With my first few sips of this beer I was not too impressed. But I let it sit for a few minutes and warm up some. Truly an amazing beer. Very dark brown beer with a good head but no lacing. Not as many different flavors as say the Maredsous 8, but whats there is better. Excellent mouthfeel and very drinkable. I think this may be my favorite dubbel. I'm glad I bought two bottles."
"Aroma is that of a single malt distiller. Rough, musty timber, warm peat, and sour tang of the distiller's feet. Entering the mouth, its almost creamy. Smooth sensation then follows with sweetness and tartness of a fruit, but mouth fills with the body of malt. The expansive feeling in my mouth is quite amazing. The carbonation, alcohol, and body all make for a full experience. The mouth is left dry and sweet, and definitely ready for another sip. My own sense of duty must override my mouth's desire for more. I've managed to make this last for 45 minutes though, and its just getting better."
"i want more of this stuff...now. luckily, a local store had a handful in stock. i'll have to make it an out of stock item for them tomorrow. this beer is, quite simply, amazing. it pours a dark dark amber/brown colour with a medium tan head that dissolves rather quickly. the smell just blew me away. it sort of reminded me of a red wine, with a grapey/fruit quality to it. this is apparent in the taste as well, and there is some earthiness here along with some tart and some sweetness, all intermingling with a bit of butter flavouring. wow. smooth as hell and easy to drink. the alcohol is apparent but not intrusive here. just an exceptional beer all around. search everywhere for this one if you have to."
"The offering smelled of dark candied malt accompanied by an appropriately dark brown color. It tasted quite good, sweetish with complex notes of malt and caramel. There was an intricate aftertaste that was complemented by a bitterness that was not from hops, but coated all 360° of the back of my mouth. The bottle, in a tasteful way that ran counter to modern commercial methods, was completely bare except for the bottle cap, which designated the brewery and the title 8°."
"Drinkability: How about all the time?! Fantastic beer with great complexity and great dinkability. This is what brewing is all about."
"To date the most interesting and tasty beer I've had. This has everything in the right place for the style-how would/could it be better-only if it were more readily available. The beer pours a massive head in which underneath lies a very dark brownish red life substaining beverage. Aromas are at once complex, inviting and very unique. The beer is richly malty, yet softly fruity at the same time. The balace here is perfect! In the mouth a triumph of complexity! Rich and malty with deep roasted flavors followed by mildly assertive bitterness. Extremely subtle fruitiness comes enveloped in flavors the finest bitter chocolate. The alcohol, while strong is so well integrated you hardly know it's there...until all the sudden you do! This may be better consumed in a soup bowl..it'll last longer! This is like drinking a beer version of Chateau Margaux ! A real treat!"
"Without a shadow of a doubt, one of the Very Best Beers available in the World today."
"Very smooth and exceptionally easy to drink. Well worth what I paid."
"Basically this is an amazing beer. Beautiful combination of all the dark malts and bitter fruit flavors. All in perfect balance and harmony. I actually like this better than the abt 12. Almost worth the $8 a bottle."
"Comments  I had never heard of this beer until I went into a store and, for no real reason, tossed it in my cart. When I logged on I realized that I may have grabbed a diamond in the sand, and I was right."
"This pours Dark brown w/ a huge head. This beer is very Malty w/ flavors of raisin & warmth. It finishes very sweetly. You can't go wrong with any of the Westy beers"
"Here's to all the monks, toiling for our sins, and crafting this exceptional, gorgeous, transcendental work!"
"Similar to its big brother, Westvleteren 12, Number 8 pours a cloudy mahogany huge with a monster head that subsides after a minute or so in the chalice glass. Smell is diverse with notes of heavy malt, yeast, apricots, and mild alcohol. This is a very tasty beer -- notes of raisins, sweet malt, very subdued hops, yeast, and alcohol are all there. Mouthfeel is superbly smooth and while easy to drink, it's a bit too rich to deserve a perfect score. This is a masterful brew, and I actually prefer it to its big brother, Number 12."
"Pours a clear amber/brown with a ton of carbonation and a massive light tan head. Out of this large head bellows the aromas of fruit, spices, and yeast that make the mouth water. The nice blend of flavors is a repeat of the smell but with more complexity. There is a wave of flavors consisting of lightly sweetened fruit, faint yeast and an array of spices and a calmly warming alcohol. This is a light to medium bodied brew and drinks down way too easy! Op uw gezonheid!"
"This beer pours the cloudy brown that I've become accustomed to with excellent Belgian beers. This one has quite a bit more head than the Rocheforts and the Westy 12. The aroma is great - smells of fruits with an undertone of alcohol. The taste is wonderfully smooth - must like the Westy12, but the taste reminds me a lot of the Rochefort 8. This is one of the best beers I've had along with the others mentioned above. If you've not had this, it's worth the high price. It leaves a great fruity taste on the palate after drinking. I could drink this beer all night if it weren't so expensive."
"This was my first Westy. It was absolutely superb! I love the caramel and fruit tastes and aroma. This may be the priciest beer that I have bought, but it is an exceptional treat. It even caused me to fork over $180.00 for a mixed full case to be shipped from Belgium of the 12, 8 and blonde. Truly nirvana!"
"A huge 'thank you' goes out to StevieW for including this heavenly brew in our trade."
"Pours with a light cream-colored head over dark hazy brown liquid with some particulate matter floating about. Nose is of raisins, a little port wine, dark fruit. Taste is quickly sweet with some phenolic character present. Then a bit of fruitiness followed by hop bitterness and an alcoholic note. Finishes more sweet than bitter. Nice, but not worth the $6 I paid for it."
"Beautiful brownish-bronze color. Moderate head with vigorous carbonation bubbles streaming up. Aroma hits you from a foot away - dark and sweet. Without a doubt the cleanest and most crisp Belgian I've come across. The malty goodness races across your tongue so fast that you want to grab it and hold on to savor. Slightly tart at the front and amazingly dry. Glides away at the finish with just enough bitterness. Drinkability factor is off the scale."
"I know I keep comparing this to the 12...but I have to. This seems to have more of a warming alcohol presence, despite the significantly lower ABV. The alcohol is prevalent at the end of each sip, however, I was a bit disappointed in the complexity. I want more. Compared to other brews though, this is a hell of a brew. A mild hoppiness blends well with the fruity and spicy flavors. When cold though, there is little flavor to this brew. Definitely must let it warm to truly appreciate it. 8 is great...but its no 12!"
"I had this beer a week ago and knew this had to be my 100th. This is without a doubt the best Dubbel I have had. A dark brown, almost reddish color with an unbelievable head that needs to settle before tasting; not an easy feat. Sticky lace on the glass just adds to the experience. Dark fruits, plums, raisins, black cherries, dominate the aromas. The same smells are dominate in the taste, as well as some bready yeast, which adds to the mystique. Unbelievably smooth carbonation, high yet drinkable. Creamy, silky mouthfeel, easy going down, very, very drinkable. I mentioned this as a quest, now the 12 is on my short list. Excellent beer."
"This is another great Westy. A complex brew that would appeal to anyone."
"Drinkability & Notes: A big thumbs up from me, more than just a noteworthy brew. Beer like this makes the big picture of good beer that much more clear. An addictive sipping style brew."
"F."
"Cheers."
"Hard to describe the taste. Very unlike any other Belgian beers I have tried. Somewhat malty, dark and fruity, but without the liveliness and spice of some other Belgian beers. Some lace, head disappeared rather quickly. I found this to be very interesting initially, but it just seemed somewhat ""off"" to me. I would love to try the 12, and will when I find it. Re-review - (Forgive me, I knew not what I was saying. I finally had this again, and it was sublime. Deep, dark, fruity, I wish I had two! Right up there with the Westmalle as the best dubbel I've had. I can't wait to compare them head to head). P.S.S.! I did a head to head with Westmalle and Loterbol. This blew them away. Fantastic! As good as any beer in the world."
"449"
"Pours a cloudy reddish-brown color, huge thick foamy head. Sweet sugary candy aroma, flavors of caremel toffee and butter, perfect thick and creamy mouthfeel, smooth and silky, It don't get any better than this, well maybe the 12."
"Hazy dark ruby in hue, topped by an off white, creamy, stiff head with typically excellent retention. A fragrant waft of floral, perfume like, rosy sweetness upfront in aroma, followed by a richer melange of dry, powered cocoa, and, raisin like dark caramel Special B. Yeast derived fruitiness aromawise is mild, but is perceptibly acidic, tropical, and slightly citric in nature. Flavorwise, the initial honey like sweetness fades slightly, then allows a complex melange of biscuity malt, oak and rich carob to envelope the palate. Pleasantly minerally, slightly salty notes and dry, spicy black pepper lend a pseudo savory mid palate impression. Mellow phenol complements malt sweetness well, lending a clove laced molasses undertone. Moderate in body, with an agreeably smooth and deceivingly light mouthfeel. Finishes w/ notes of black licorice and brown sugar lingering. 8 is a delicious beer, with tremendous depth in character all around. It's not as assertive in outright yeast derived flavor contributions compared to other Dubbels, yet the malt profile is tremendously complex and refined. It's worth the price... a true treat."
"Wow. God is in the details (and I am not a religious man), but something divine is going on in this beer. Deep brown with hints of copper coming through, and a huge, rocky tan head. The first smell is unmistakably Belgian yeast, with dark fruits, some chocolate, fresh baked cinnamon-raisin bread. Flavors of dates, grapes, pepper, again fresh baked cinnamon-raisin bread. Sweet and spicy. Spice lingers on the tongue for quite some time, reminding you of the divine craftsmanship of these monks. Heavenly."
"The beer pours a nebulous deep black cherry color, ponderous somewhat frothy beige head, and thick lace to cling mightily to the glass, also a ""Bazillion tiny bubbles, sliding their little butts up the glass"". Not many beers have a better nose, malt, banana, slight yeasty or bread dough if you prefer, over ripe fruit, just makes your mouth water smelling this wonderful beer. Sweet start, light to the top, finish is merciful in its acidity, potently hopped, droughty long lasting aftertaste. A fine cousin to the ""12, 10"" and well worth the try!"
"Nutty nose with a hint of sweetness.  Deep manogany hazy color.  White lasting head.  Smooth malty feel (milkshake).  Nutty (hazel?) rich malty flavor. Medium body.  Slight fruity (yeast) grapefruit finish.  This beer just screams quality and craftmanship. If you see it buy it.. you won't be sorry."
"When you pour it, it sounds like a cola with its fizzy, lively head. Bubbles steam up the sides, again much like a coke, but with this beer, the head stays, but forms an odd concave surface as the middle starts to fade, but the outside stay much the same, reinforced by the constant bubbling. Head lacks the creaminess of the 12. Initial flavor is surprisingly realistic cocoa. There was some complexity, but that was the big flavor. Not as complex or as balanced as it's big brother."
"Deep brown in colour, with excellent lasting head, lace could have been better. One of the best aromas in any beer, fruit, plums chocolate, evem coriander or nutmeg or somethin'.  Tasty stuff, sweetish, chalky, bit of pudding, bit of chocolate, bit of candy sugar, just a lighter version of the 12, dangerously easy to drink, full flavour profile aswell, quite unique, but doesn't compare to the 12."
"The most perfect beer ever made.  Westvleteren's unique yeasty flavor in their beers is unparalleled, and each Westvleteren 8 you drink will be an experience you never forget.  Trappist beer at its best."
"Notes: I'd go as far as saying that this is without a doubt one of the best beers on the planet. Truly a masterpiece."
