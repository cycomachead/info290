"Nice finish. Great balance throughout. Not too exciting though. As expected"

"good beer , not a fun of beers too sweet but this one got good balance"

"Poured into snifter. Hazy dark brown beer with a ring of golden head. Spicy aroma with prunes, toffee & candy sugar. Taste of dark fruits, wheat, yeasts. Medium body, prickly carbonation. Decent dubbel."

"O: Overall, this wasn't too bad, it might be one of the ""worst"" dubbels that I've tried before but that's only because I have high standards. Nonetheless, it's not worth the price to me. For a few dollars more or a few dollars less (Unibroue) I could be in a Belgian heaven right now. Instead I'm only content."
"Overall, it's got great aroma, but the flavor is both hit AND miss. I could do without the port wine notes and the tartness is almost too much at times, almost medicinal, so for a Dubbel, it's good but not up there with the best."

"Overall 4.0: This is another unique take on the standard Belgian Dark and it is nonetheless still outstanding. Balanced, smooth and very refreshing in spite of its big ABV, this beer is excellent for sessioning or simply trying the style. Definitely a ""gateway"" beer into the wider and more apocalyptic realm of Belgian Darks. The path hath been lain before you, pilgrim. Here there be...dragons."

"Ugly dark purple/brown beer with a thin, fizzy head that quickly dissipates leaving no lacing behind. The fizzing is very loud, pours almost like a soda. Smells like sweet raisin bread with some caramel apple notes. Tastes sweet and fizzy, strong raspberry soda flavor that gives way to the more bready malt character that has hints of raisins, plums, dates. Tangy finish, surprisingly dry, scary drinkable for 9%. An unusual beer to me. As it warms it seems to get thicker with a dark cherry flavor and a stronger alcohol bite. The fizziness is very distracting and makes this seem almost like ""beer soda""."

"This is a decent and flavorful dubbel but rather coarse and weak with the mouthfeel. Certainly not bad, but not necessarily a 'must-have'."

"Overall it was a decent brew. I wasn't very impressed but I enjoyed it."

"Pours a murky brown with a foamy khaki head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, brown sugar, dark fruits, and spices. Taste is much the same with a mild spice bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer with some nice aromas and flavors."
"overall, a little too sweet (although i like the sweeter brews normally). i think it's rich and filling and is a decent brew, but again, there are better belgiums, for certain...."

"330 ml bottle into chalice, June 2010 date notched. Pours very cloudy dark reddish brown color with a 1 finger dense dark khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Decent spotty lacing on the glass, with a small bit of carbonation streaming up. Aromas of big raisin, prune, caramel, molasses, bread, pepper, clove, earth, candi sugar, light chocolate, nuttiness, and yeast spices. SOme pretty nice aromas with good balance and complexity. Taste of big raisin, prune, caramel, molasses, chocolate, toffee, bread, toast, pepper, clove, herbal, nuttiness, and earthy yeast spices. Moderately dry on the finish; with lingering notes of dark fruit, chocolate, nuttiness, pepper, and earthy spiciness on the finish for a short bit. Nice balance of flavors; with a bit more maltiness over the earthy spiciness. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a very smooth mouthfeel with the carbonation. Alcohol is extremely well hidden with pretty much no warming noticed at all after the finish. Extremely easy to drink. Overall this is a nice Dubbel. It wasnâ€™t as robust in flavors as I was expecting; but it was still nicely balanced and fairly complex. Quite enjoyable."

"Poured from bottle dated July 2010 to Duvel tulip the beer arrives a cloudy deep dark brown with a small 1/2 finger off-white head, some retention, almost no lacing. The nose is odd, dark fruits and belgian yeast, though a prevalent vinegar character that doesn't seem to fit, perhaps a mishandled bottle? Interestingly enough the vinegar is not found in the flavor, at all. Mildly sweet with a fruity ester in the yeast blend fairly well with the dark fruits. Medium bodied the beer finishes with a lingering plum flavor. No hint of higher abv. Overall, not bad but not great. Doubt I'd go out of my way for this brew again."

"overall - about average for a Dubbel."
"O: exceptionally enjoyable; higher ABV is well hidden. Nearly world-class Belgian Bruin, similar to Maredsous."
"Overall a very pleasant real Belgium dubbel with slight tart flavors mostly sweet and a nice body. Best $1.75 I ever spent."
"This had some real potential. The nose is superb. I think I could have gotten more out of it if I hadn't had the St. Feuillien Wit before. The acidity got to my tongue. The big set up by the aroma was a terrible let down in the taste, as the metallic aftertaste really just stripped any complexity or richness that the aroma and front end of the taste promised. I'm kinda mad a this beer, really. It could have been a contender. I'm going to try this from a bottle to see if maybe the lines at The Refuge were to blame. I'm staying hopeful, I guess."

"Overall: The elements for a good dubbel are here, but the execution leaves a bit to be desired, unfortunately"
""
"Another average offering from St. Martin. They represent the styles that they do relatively well, but again, nothing sets this one apart from your standard dubbel."
"An attractive beer that reveals a slightly simpler side when you get to know it, but never lets you down, and keeps you content the entire time you are together, which is something you really cannot find too much fault with."
"O: Solid, but honestly a bit forgettable. Lacks some expected complexity, but is more refreshing as a trade off, especially since the finish is so clean. A little age adds a nice character to the finish, upping the flavor a bit."
"Enjoyed this one in the company of the brewer himself! Bottle February 2010. Served from bottle into a St. Martin tulip. Poured ruby red with a three finger light tan head that subsided to two fingers really slowly. Maintained nice lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, dark fruit, bread, and alcohol. The flavor was of sweet malt, dark fruit, bread, plum, raisins, and sweet alcohol. It had a medium feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. I really liked how complex the flavor was on this one for a Dubbel. However at 8% you definitely would have thought it was much higher due to the flavors of alcohol you got off of it. The aroma was a little weak in comparison to the flavor but was still pretty nice. A definite must try if you get the opportunity."
"Overall, this isn't bad. It's a pretty good dubbel, but not spectacular."
"The beer pours a brown color with a small off-white head, about the color of iced tea. The aroma is candy sugar with a lot of toffee malt and a tad bit of dark fruit. The flavor is similar. I get some sweet candy sugar/brown sugar notes as well as some caramel and toffee. The alcohol is definitely detectable. Thin to medium mouthfeel and high, prickly carbonation. A decent dubbel but not one of the best."
"Abbey St. Martin Brown's first taste is rich, roasted malts, followed closely by dark fruits, which are relatively restrained. The beer has a decent mouthfeel, and is refreshing for a dubbel, with moderate carbonation. It's eminently drinkable, and the alcohol is extremely well hidden. If it's been around since 1096, it's got to be good; run out and get yourself some today."
"On tap at M'Coul's in Greensboro.Poured into a Orval glass a chesnut brown with a tinge of burnt orange,a weel difened head atop.Phenol spice sticks out most in the nose along with subtle dark fruit.Flavors of clove-spice and dark fruit,almost fruit cake in nature.Like others of said its not overly complex but its got decent flavors."
"750ml bottle served in my Chimay Chalice. Bottled March 2010 notched on the back label. Pours a dull brownish-purple with a loose, half inch, cream-colored head pockmarked with tiny craters. A consistent sheet of tiny bubble clusters adhered to the walls of the glass below the cap. Head eventually dissipates into a sudsy skim and a thin, bubbly band around the shoulders. Some spots of lacing, but no adherence. Nose expresses dark fruit (prunes and plums) and a mild, vinous quality. There's also a slightly bready/maltiness in the mix. Taste pales in comparison to the nose - muted and bland with a trace of something metallic in the mix. There's also a bit of yeast that cuts across the flavor profile. Virtually no aftertaste - flavors just drop away between quaffs. Mouthfeel is light-medium with a lively carbonation that offers a slight bite at the back of the throat before culminating in a pleasant, dry finish. All and all, a bit dull for style - not bad, but not something I plan on revisiting anytime soon."
"Pours a one-finger khaki head that fades quickly leaving no lace. Cloudy brown color. Light-medium carbonation and medium bodied. Nose is very light fruit, flavor is light and dark fruit, some sweetness. Bottled May 2009. $4.49 for a 330ml bottle from Julio's Liquors Westborough, Ma."
"I'm not so sure about this one. The color was a deep murky brown color. The taste had this strange sweetness to it but it also had a bit of a dirt like flavor too. This dubbel doesn't really hit home for me. It's not the most refreshing Abbey Dubbel I've ever had and not much above average either. I think I can leave this one on the shelf from now on at the store."
"Found this one at the apparently discounted price of $29 for a case of 33cl bottles, which is the only reason that I tried it, suspiciously. Bottle conditioned, less likely to be stale, worth a shot. Carbonation moderate, with a tendancy to gush upon opening. Noisy, big bubbles fade quickly. Typical dark, sweet raisin wafting, but refreshingly thin and dry on the tongue. Just a bit meaty and metallic, not unpleasant. Easy to drink more than one, despite 8% ABV. Considering price, it ranks as a very good beer, although probably a middle of the road Belgian Dubbel."
"Mouthfeel - A bit thinner than the norm. Average."
"Pours a dark brown w/ a two finger caramel head that sticks around for a while. The smell is that of malt, fruit, sweetness and a kind of metallic smell I can't put my finger on. That single handedly takes the smell score down a notch or two. Fortunately, I don't taste that particular thing. Sweet fruit, malt and alcohol are present in the taste. A little thin tasting for what I'd prefer, but not bad. Mouthfeel is not bad, but a little thin for me. Malt in the aftertaste, which quickly goes away. Drinkability isn't bad. I've had the St. Martin's Tripel, and I think that's a better effort. Still, not bad, and glad I got to finally try this one."
"medium bodied with medium carbonation. not real big on the drinkability score... in the final analysis you could do a lot worse than this beer; you could also do a lot better."
"Cola-like as opposed to the creamy fullness of the better Belgian dubbels. Date and raisin, pecan and walnut, toffee and light chocolate notes. Not too bad, but there are much better examples out there."
"I gave it a 4.5 on drinkability just because it is 8%. If it was 4% (which it kind of tastes like), you could throw these down all nice. They go down really easy."
"Not as deep or complex as expected, very drinkable though. Worth a go."
"d- not the best drinkability, could be much more flavorful, but it's drinkable. when i reach for a belgian - which isn't often - i want a really flavorful tasty one, this fell short."
"FIRST REVIEW :-)"
"Mouthfeel is medium-light with a fizzy amount of carbonation."
"Not a bad Belgian. This is very mild and slightly watery. The flavors aren't too complex, but are very faint."
"Got this the same day as the Tripel a while ago, might as well drink 'em the same day today. This one pours a ruby-tinged dark amber-brown topped by a half-finger of ecru foam. The nose comprises maple syrup, dark wheat, figs, brown sugar, and a light touch of cocoa. The taste waters down the syrup, does away with the cocoa, and emphasizes the wheat and figs. Some raisins are thrown in for good measure as well. The body is a steady, almost light, medium, with a light carbonation and a smooth, grainy feel. Overall, a very nice dubbel, maybe not the paragon of the style, but definitely a nice, easy drinker."
"Fullish body with a light but sharp efferervescence. Slightly dry finish with a little warmth. Quite a good beer."
"D: The beer is very easy to drink and the alcohol is very well hidden."
"Another unsatisfying beer from the St. Martin line. I won't be buying any again. Especially at the ridiculous price of $4.60 for an 11.2oz bottle."
"Pours a hazy solid brown, with a vigorous tan head that dissupates into a thin cover that stays in place. Definite Belgian funk adding some dried fruit and spice (a bit of clove, maybe cinnamon) to a whole wheat breadiness and a bit of alcohol vapor. Flavor starts out with brown sugar sweetness that is cleansed by hop bitterness and perhaps a touch of sour. The beer tastes a lot less full that it is, probably due to the hops, touch of sour, and the significant alcohol presence. Certainly not the most complex Belgian style brew on the market, by why does it have to be? it does what it does quite well and scores a lot more points in the drinkability column than most 8% ABV beers, though trying to session this beer will fog the brain cells far faster than it will tire the taste buds."
"Not bad at all, some interesting variations of familiar flavors. It wears the alcohol well at 8%, & I feel like one would be enough. One I wouldn't turn down if offered to me again."
"Strong Belgian malt flavor with a similarly alcoholic taste. Thin body with a high carbonation level. Smooth finish, but a short aftertaste of fresh berry. Certainly, this is a predictably full flavored beer, but it is small in many ways."
"Drinkability : a good beer in the style Dubbel."
"Poured hazy reddish brown with a moderate creamy off-white head that lasted with good lacing. Moderate spicy dark fruity aroma. Medium body with a sticky texture and soft carbonation. Medium complex bittersweet flavor with a medium bittersweet finish of moderate duration. Good spicy brew."
"Pours a clear, brown color. 1/3 inch head of an off-white color. Good retention and decent lacing. Smells of sweet malt, yeast, and slight alcohol. Fits the style of a Dubbel. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp with a high carbonation level. Tastes of yeast, sweet malt, slight dark citrus, and slight pale hop. Overall, the high carbonation hurts, but overall a good simple Dubbel."
"A new one in this area. It pours a dark nutty brown, with a tan head that just keeps going and going and going. This one's a bit hazy because of all the bubbles encased in the beverage. The nose is a bit underwhelming, but there are hints of that familiar Belgian dubbel dark fruitiness, along with some dark malt and sweet sugary characteristics as well. The flavor is a bit odd, but I really like it; it's not as sweet and fruity as most Belgian dubbels. Instead, it's more like a strong American brown ale without the over-the-top hoppiness. I admit it's very refreshing to taste this, and I clearly want more like it! It is a tad over-carbonated for my taste--sometimes I find myself fighting through the bubbles to get to some flavor. It's very drinkable for the style, and may be a sort of ""gateway"" beer for new initiates into the Belgian beer experience. Cheers!"
"Notes: Though it is by no means rare, this seems to be the least-known beer I've reviewed and maybe even tried. In fact, I haven't had a legitimate Belgian brew before (aside from Stella Artois). By the way, the aforementioned ""Dark Triple"" was definitely a notch above this one. Would prefer the Tripel style and I'm sure there are better readily available examples of the Dubbel than this. Was a neat experience to purchase and try, though."
"Drinkability: An interesting Belgian. Good for what it is. Simple flavors that work well."
"I love Dubbels but there are much more desirable examples out there. I relate St Martin Brune to a lot of movies I've seen: it was worth sitting through once but not really a second time. I liked it alright, it was well worth the price of admission but I wouldn't necessarily recommend it to others. Final review: one thumb up, one thumb sideways."
"This wasn't bad, but doesn't really compare to other Belgian beers for either taste or aroma. The beer has a nice deep copper color, but the smell borders on metallic, not yeasty like a typical Belgian. The flavor is also a bit one dimension and thin, with neither the yeastiness one expects from this variety nor the roasted sweetness typical of dark beers. This would probably be fairly drinkable, but I wouldn't have too many of them based on the quality of beer for the price. Flying Dog even does Belgians a lot better than this one (not to mention Chimay, Corsendonk, Saint Bernardus, Duvel, etc.)."
"330 ml bottle, now available in Norway at Vinmonopolet. ABV is 8%. Mahogany coloured beer, huge beige head. Moderate aroma, notes of caramel, brown malts, brown bread and dust, hints of marzipan. The flavour has notes of brown bread with hints of caramel, but this is probably the driest dubbel I have ever had. Dust in the finish, very moderate hops. The alcohol is well hidden - I would have guessed that this was a 5.5- 6% beer, not 8%. Definitely drinkable, but far from exciting."
"D - good for the winter, drinkable. Nothing complex about it and not necessarily the beer I would look forward to buying again."
"Pours a cola brown color with no haze, and a large head at first that recedes to no head at all rather quickly. Nose has plenty of dark fruits and strongly suggests it will be a dessert beer for sure. On the palate the dark fruit component is center stage with plenty of carbonation, rather nice body, and some mineral-cave like must flavors in the mix. Finish is sweet and reminds me of figs."
"D- A decent brew but nothing to brag about."
"But, that being said, it is quite drinkable. A good beer."
"D) I thoroughly enjoyed this beer. It is an excellent example of the Belgian dubbel category"
"11.2oz bottle, bought for about $3 in Columbus. The beer is dark hazy brown, nearly opaque, with a thick solid tan head. The aroma is sweet, caramel and dark fruits, maybe a little cough syrup, kind of reminds me of Gouden Carolus or an aged Belgian dark ale (which this might be, I don't see a date stamp). The taste is estery, dark fruits like plums and raisins, some ethanol too, OK but not mindblowing considering all the Belgian ales of high quality out there. Average body, drinkability is set to ""slow"" which is probably about right for the style. Overall average-to-middling."
"11.2 oz shipped from the beer motherland. Almost black in color with a thick creamy light tan head. Smells of raisins, brown sugar, and oranges. Seems much darker than most dubbels, both in appearance & smell. The taste is malty, sweet, again like brown sugar. It has a dry finish that balances the sweet up front. The mouthfeel is slick, with nice carbonation. Drinkability is good, although its a bit too dark & intense for a session beer. But this bottle and I are becoming good friends."
"D: very easy to drink for an 8%, and well worth it. $6 for a 12oz, though, yikes."
"Overall it's a fairly interesting beer, and it's pretty enjoyable."
"D-While this isn't a bad beer, it lacks the complexity of some of the better examples."
"Bottle: Poured a hazy deep brown color ale with large foamy head with good retention and good lacing. Aroma of candi sugar with good Belgian malt backbone. Taste is also a nice mix between some candi sugar and strong malt backbone with some notes of dry fruits such as raisins. Good carbonation and full body with no noticeable alcohol. Very well done overall and a bit more character would have made this even better."
"Pours a dark brown color with foamy white head. Dark fruit, spice and candi fruit aroma. Quite carbonated up front with lots of dark fruit (raisin, plum and prune), spices and candi sugar. Sweet, but not too much so, with a nice dry finish."
"Dark brown in color-somewhat cloudy-nice head and a high CO2 level. Nutty and malty aroma-quite bready and a touch of yeastiness. Solid malt flavor with a slight spiciness reminiscent of cinnamon. Nice lingering yeasty/sulfur taste. Good mouthfeel-the high carbonation really livens it up a bit. Nice dubbel and very enjoyable."
"Dark to the point of being almost black with a foamy tan head this beer smells like raisin tarts. The flavour favours the fruit over the dark musty side of a dubbel. Not a ton of complexity but a pleasand dubbel that is like raisin pie with a funky Belgian twist."
"D: Not bad flavor wise but certainly would not hold my attention beyond the initial first drink. Thins out towards the finish and is somewhat disappointing after a initial promising start."
"Abbaye de Saint-Martin Brune is a poor man's Belgian dubbel. Not that the bottle was cheap ($4.49), but it isn't even close to being well-crafted enough to compete with the best of style. Bottom line: decent beer that is definitely not worth the money."
"The mouthfeel was wonderful, only adding to the enjoyment. Very drinkable and social. This is a great beer."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability: The mouthfeel, much like the flavor, in my opinion, is thin and fleeting. Finish is somewhat dry. This is one I'm glad to have tried, but I don't think that I'll be coming back to it. This isn't one I'd seek out, just nothing all that great about it."
"I tried this beer on March 7, 2008 at ""Smokeless Joe's in Toronto, Ontario. The beer poured a dark cloudy reddish-brown colour with a tan coloured head. The aroma was sweet malt, some yeast, and raisins. The mouthfeel was medium-bodied with high-carbonation, almost champagne-like. The flavour was also sweet malt, with a definite alcoholic taste in back."
""
"Pours a beautiful dark amber color with a medium tan head. Musty aroma that I find all their beers have. Flavor is much lighter than expected. Mild dark fruit, plum. Cinnamon. Bitter, astringent aftertaste. Medium body, but flavor seems watered down. Much better bruins out there."
"R- Although very tasty, the Abbey De Saint-Martin Brune just did not impress me, its a good representation of the style but there's something about its cheap packaging and its overall execution that doesn't do it for me. I'll still judge it fairly."
"Worth a try..."
"Poured a dark ruby color with a thin off-white head. Very bubbly but not much flowing towards the nose. I couldn't pin down anything. The first taste is of raisins. I couldn't put my finger on it right away. I hate eating raisins and haven't had one since I was a small child so it took a minute to figure that one out. After that the carbonation took over and the flavors were muted. Of course, not really any detection of alcohol which made a very drinkable beer. Overall, the beer was good but in my experience the carbonation in this style has usually heightened the aromas and flavors and this one ended up being ""flat."""
"Poured an orangey light brown into a sampler glass, with a slightly grey fluffy head. Big thing with this one is the excellent mouthfeel. Flavour is mild chocolate and cocoa, quite deep and dark for a dubbel, but very nice. Some raisins in there, and mild sour notes as it gets warmer. Aftertaste is just a little ""off"" although I'm not sure if I can describe it. Really nice, although I'm biased as I've never found a dubbel I didn't like."
"Much lighter in complexity in the mouth which may be a culprit of over carbonation. The beer has a very prickly carbonation that blasts the tastebuds and makes things hard to comprehend. Caramel notes with very minor milk chocolate accents with much less pronounced dried fruit characteristicts. Mainly dates with a bit of prune. A floral bitterness comes through on the finish as well as some alcohol burn in the chest."
"D: Good."
"Light brown yeast treat with a great spicy fruity aroma and aggressive carbonation. Thanks John. Candi and caramel, a bit burnt mollasses that gives it a dark fruit prune edge. good dubbel style that may improve by mellowing with some ageing.Lingering sweetness."
