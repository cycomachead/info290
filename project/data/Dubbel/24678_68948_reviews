"O: Very balanced, very well crafted beer. Got at Oppermans in Saginaw, drank June 2nd, 2014 in Uxbridge. Very well crafted beer"

"O: Overall, this was an excellent local dubbel. It was not revolutionary or anything but it hit the spot."

"O: So proud to see a brewery in GR making Belgian style beers, and doing it well. This is another great beer from Brewery Vivant. Not the best dubbel you can get in the US, but for a truly local brewery, this is pretty damn good."
""
""
"Feel: medium body; carbonation is lively, perhaps too lively."

"I am surprised that BV did not have better quality control of their outgoing product. Perhaps the experience of a costly recall caused BV to re-evaluate their quality control."
"Beer has a nice color once poured in a tulip. The aroma was nice at first but when I really stuck my nose in I thought something was off. The carbonation seemed differant than other beers I have drank. When first hitting my palate the flavor was OK but it ended up having a musty sour taste. Perhaps I got an old can but I think the beer went bad."
"16 ounce can into tulip glass, no canning date. Pours moderately hazy deep ruby red color with a 2 finger fairly dense light khaki head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty foamy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of big cherry, raisin, prune, pear, caramel, candi sugar, pepper, clove, toast, light chocolate, herbal, brown sugar, and yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of fruity/spicy yeast and malt notes; with good strength. Taste of cherry, raisin, prune, pear, caramel, toast, pepper, clove, candi sugar, light chocolate, molasses, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Lingering notes of dark fruits, caramel, toast, clove, pepper, light chocolate, candi sugar, molasses, herbal, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and complexity of fruity/spicy yeast and dark malt flavors; with a good malt/spiciness balance and zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, lightly slick, and slightly syrupy mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice Belgian dark ale! All around good balance, complexity, and robustness of fruity/spicy yeast and malt flavors; and very smooth to drink. A very enjoyable offering."

"The vinous character that dominates the flavor profile really detracts from the experience. Subtle eater characters emerge later, but the sharp acidic notes are too powerful to overcome. Yeast esters are somewhat lackluster."
""
""
"Mouthfeel is good. Medium body and a tart sweetness gives this a nice sticky feel."

"Overall impression: A beautiful crafted and delicate dubble. A little lighter for the style but immensely refreshing and drinkable. Wish this were available to me in Ohio."

"The flavor just hurts the overall beer here. Off flavors abound, not what I was hoping for here."

"I rarely drainpour beer, but this one is getting that treatment."
""
"Fresh purple raisins soaked in white grape juice. The beer pours a nice deep garnet/brown with a slightly cloudy haze (swirl the last two ounces and pour into the glass to accentuate the yeast character). The beer is a lean easy drinker with a great saison-like lemon and ester character that is amped up by a healthy dose of dark fruit notes from either special-b malt or dark candi sugar. Really enjoying this one. I tend to think of it as a fall version of a saison."

"Not a bad beer, but not what I was expecting. Being Belgian, I was expecting a funk. A tartness. Some sort of weird twist -- I didn't really get that. Solitude is definitely a solid beer, but not my favorite from Vivant. I'm not sure how long this can was sitting, since there's no canning date, but that may explain why I don't get many of those Belgian characteristics in this beer. I recommend it."

"Aroma & Taste: A very interesting beer. Contains chocolate and nutty notes mixed with dark fruits. The way the chocolate and nutty flavors mashed with the raisin and plum flavors was quite delightful."
"After tasting the Solitude from Brewery Vivant, I realized it did not fit my specific flavor profile or taste bud selection. The beer had a great dark color that resembled a coco or chocolate brown. The smell to me was very unpleasant and almost musty. The flavor was also musty and in my opinion sour. I think that many darker beer drinkers would appreciate this beer for it's full-bodied dark flavor but it unfortunately did not fit my specific pallet."
""
""
"Solitude pours out a brown color with a massive head (even with a slow pour). The aroma is sweet, malty, and slightly sour with some dark fruits. The taste is very good, offering a bit of sugary (yet dark fruit based) sweetness over a slightly tart base. Yeast imparts just a bit of spiciness. Very well composed and tasty. The mouthfeel is medium-bodied and gently carbonated, and the drinkability is good. Overall, one of the most enjoyable Belgian-style beers I've had from the States. It stays away from the pitfalls of either too much spicy yeast flavors, or too much Candi sugar that too many American brewers of Belgian styles fall into."

"O- This beer is pretty light in flavor with the tartness of their house yeast that I just care for. There is not much malt flavor or yeasty esters that make a good dubble, but more than that it just has a lot of off flavors regardless of what style you want to label it."
"16oz can, pours brown with lots of carbonation and a thin foamy off-white head. Aromas are malty and sweet with brown sugar, fruity (pear, apple), spice, bready yeast, raisin. Tastes are complex and can be overly sweet at times with notes of dark fruit, raisin, caramel, pear, apple, spice, rum, yeast, brown sugar, tea. Moderate carbonation gives fuller feel to the medium body. Sweet and spicy on the finish. Overall, good but by the end of the 16oz I was sick of it."

"Big thanks to shamrock for hooking it up!"

"Damn you, Spelunky, for your addictiveness and pain! Anyway, this stuff pours a slightly murky amber-sienna topped by a finger of sandy khaki foam. The nose comprises maple syrup, light soy sauce, clove, lightly-toasted caramel, and mild Belgian yeast. The taste brings in more of the same, minus the soy sauce (thankfully), plus some light bread, and plus some light cocoa. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a sorta/kinda dry finish. Overall, a nice little Belgian deal, nothing spectacular, but a welcome sight in a can 'round here."
""
""
"Dark amber with a thin off-white head and some translucence--this smelled fairly light, all things considered, but the taste is dark malt, plums, raisins, tart, a touch of caramel. The mouthfeel is pleasant but the finish is a bit too sweet. It's a solid beer but there are better in its class."

"(O)- So far, I am really liking what I am seeing from Vivant. A nice and easy drinking belgian dark ale. Looking forward to trying out their other beers for sure."
""
""
""
"O: The nose was nice, but the taste was a slight let down. I was expecting a fully body and more dark fruit flavors."
"Drinkability: It's a very smooth drinkable beer accompanied with good flavors and aromas. It's not overly complex for a Belgian dark but still solid."
""
""
""
"Dark brown, almost purplish with a tan/beige head. Fluffy retention, and some pretty thick lacing. Nose has a whole load of Belgian yeast, a bit of dark fruit, an herbal note. A bit earthy, perhaps a bit of chalk. Tastes of dark fruit (a bit date-y/prune-y), grape juice, dry, earthy, some metal and again a bit chalky. Yeast in the finish. Medium body, but a bit on the thinner side. Medium low carb. An OK beer, but I probably wouldn't seek this one out again."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This beer is a good candidate for when you want a beer on a hot day, but your not in the mood for a hoppy beer. Its meant to be a session ale no doubt."
""
""
""
"Overall: This is a pretty boring beer. Not bad for what it is trying to be, but I definitely didn't find anything that would make me come back for more."
""
"M: very nice mouthfeel with good roasted malt up front and well-balanced hop finish, a bit on thinner side of an abbey ale but too off, creamy texture"
""
""
"D - A passable US-made Belgian Dark Ale, but suffers from some problems in the finish. Hopefully they can tweak the recipe a bit so that the taste matches the smell better. Again, very weird drinking a Belgian-style beer from a tallboy."
"Not very complex but not too bad."
"D and O: Not a whole lot of complexity going on here. It has some good malt sweetness, but kind of lacks depth. Easy drinking, and another quality Michigan brew, yet just falls short."

"This is a very good brew. As this beer is from the nearby metropolis of Grand Rapids, MI I had to give it a try. I tasted lots of malty sweetness and raisins. Neither of these flavors was overbearing and there is a good balance among all the different elements. Head was foamy and quickly dissipated, leaving behind some decent lacing on the glass. I will definitely be purchasing this again."
""
""
"poured from the can into a tulip. a full finger of tan bubbly head quickly settles onto a burnt brown body with hints of red around the edges. the nose consists of bready malts, spice, maybe clove, raisins and a little roasted smokieness. taste is very sweet with lots of dark fruit and spice. the smoke really comes out on the backend as it warms. mouthfeel is rather thin and watery, lacks carbonation but goes down easy. overall this is a decent beer better as it warms, brings out tobacco and smoke, and probably just as good from the can as it is in a glass."
"O= Overall, This beer from Brewery Vivant is a lot better than some of the other beers that I've had from them I would say this is one of there top ones worth a try if you come across it."
"Probably the most Belgian of the three Brewery Vivant beers I had. Too bad I did not find the taste to my liking."
"Roasted malts and coffee bitterness up front. Roasted coffee flavor carries through as plummy malts and sweetish sugar fills out the palate. Notes of chocolate, smoke, tobacco and earthy, mineral-y peat near the finish. Spicy, roasted bitterness lingers. Moderate body with a slightly bubbly feel. Could use a little more sweet, plummy maltiness for balance, as it's a bit roasty. Still, not bad."
"dark brown color with this tin wispy head of off white that capped the top only for a slight time offering little in the way of side lacing. aroma of roasted malts, light smoke, and hints of chocolate, nice and warming, but lacked the punch i was looking for. flavor was more of the same, not bad at all, had all the right markers there with light peat, lots of chocolate, deep roasted profile, just too light for me to be honest. thin feel"
"all in all, this is an interesting and impressive brew. it took me a while to warm up to the characteristics of this garnet hued gem, but once I did, wow. Impressive, interesting, and different. definitely wouldn't turn down another."
"Mouth is a bit thin in the middle but fills out at the finish. A nice beer."
"O: A good beer and one that is very drinkable. However, it just seems a little weak in all categories. I'm not looking for this beer to be a monster, but I also shouldn't have to search for the aroma and just as the flavor presents itself, it just falls off a cliff. With that, I did enjoy it quite a bit and I'd definitely have another."
"Overall this is another Vivant beer that comes off as very ho-hum. I really want to visit the brewery and see what these beers are like on tap, but judging from the cans it seems that they have a lot of work to do if they want to be a quality Belgian style brewery."
"Brewery Vivant did a pretty nice job with Solitude. It’s a pretty solid release all-around. It could be improved with a stronger nose and more of a Belgian yeast presence, but it’s pretty good as it is. For a recent upstart, Brewery Vivant is showing some promise. Keep it up, guys!"
"Color me impressed...Dubbels are one of my very favorite styles and after reading some of the reviews on this website, I was a little skeptical so I didn't buy a 4-pack. I will gladly go back and get a few 4-packs. My only critique would be that the body is a little thin...perhaps if they adjusted their mash temp up a few degrees they could improve that."
"Overall I thought this was pretty good beer. This is my first BDA, I usually go for the BSDA's but I really like how this is a little lighter and more drinkable version that still has a lot of flavor and makes for a good beer to drink on a cool summer night. I thought this beer was highly drinkable, it was flavorful, easy to drink, and the body was lighter. If I had another one I would drink it, a four pack would be great to take to a bonfire, lots of good flavor, but it won't fill you up. What I liked most about this beer was the flavor, the combination of mildly roasted malts and Belgian yeast was really nice and it kept me coming back for more. What I liked least about this beer was the appearance, the color was nice, but it lacked having a nice head, which most Belgians usually do. I will for sure be buying this again and I would recommend this to pretty much anyone, you got love a well done Belgian style beer in a can, it's just so wrong it's right. I really like the fact this comes in pint cans, makes itls easy to take outdoors with me, and you just don't see Belgians in cans, there is enough traditional Belgians in oddly shaped small bottles, bring on the pint cans. This made for both a good first impression of this brewery and of the Belgian Dark Ale style. I really liked this beer and I can't wait to try some of the other offerings from this brewery and more of this style. Good first impression for Brewery Vivant, you can bet I will be back for more."
"Overall this is an alright beer. Not awful, but not really leaving me wanting more. Very easy to drink for a darker belgian ale. Will finish the few I have, but would probably never seek out again."
"The Crack & Glug in this instance was heavenly, producing two rocky fingers of deep-tan head with moderate retention. The inherent carbonation allowed the head to lead a rich, full life before moving on into the atmosphere. The color was more truth in advertising, although I might have said ""garnet"" or ""ruby"" as opposed to ""mahogany", but the NE-quality clarity rendered it one to drop me to my knees in prayer for more such beautifully rendered beers. It was like a liquid Illuminated Manuscript. The nose was, indeed, malty, but with an earthen quality, like tobacco. The mouthfeel was full, rich and creamy with a slightly astringent sweetness, like a combination of tobacco and anise, on the tongue. I began to hear harps and trumpets in mine ears! I have to say that as it warmed, the earthy qualities really began to come out and I was reminded of a few earthy women in my life who would have really dug this sort of thing. They are the ones who are not hung up on body hair, shower or bathe only occasionally, belch and fart with the best of men and appeal to a certain segment of the male culture. I partook of them routinely until I donned the cloth and now I partake of them regularly as nothing seems to get them off like debauching a Brother. Finish was semi-sweet and I get where they are coming from with raisin and caramel but pear simply continues to elude me. I really liked this beer and would put it in my cooler any time of year, but especially if I were headed to a nude beach avec les maitresses du moine (with the monk's mistresses)."
"Drink- A nice little beer from the midwest. Not a stunner by any means but still rather tasty. It was a big box from Kzoobrew and trying to get through them all."
"Overall, a really good, interesting take on a Belgian Dark, and less alcoholic than many of the same style."
"I enjoyed it well enough. It made me think Dubbel ""light""."
"O- Vivant is wildly hit or miss for me. For all this beer has going for it, I found it difficult to get past the unpeasant cigarette-like flavor."
"I'd heartily hand over two Schlitz Tallboys for a canned pint of Solitude. I'd call that a bargain."
"O - A disappointing brew. I wouldn't go out of my way to buy or find this one. A brew all over the board. iffy."
"Would I buy more of it? - absolutely. I need to get out to Brewery Vivant some day and try the rest of their beers on tap. A big ""cheers"" goes out to Another6Pack for this and other midwestern canned craft goodness!"
"I'd probably be happy drinking this from the can while fishing, but otherwise I'll pass on this in the future."
"Thanks to hurfer for the assist. "
"O- Overall, this is a very unique beer that grows on me the more I get into it."
