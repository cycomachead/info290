3.75,2.7,3.5,3.5,3.75,4,4,"Ah okay so lets sit down to some Abbey Ale by the Abita brewing company... I had high hopes for this brew as I'm a huge fan anything that says ""ale"" and I mean from all ends of the spectrum from Indian pale ales to smoked darker ales.. I love ale! So without further-a-do lets crack this baby open. On pouring the brew it had a deep reddish orange appearance and a thick foamy creamy brown head lasting even into my first sip. I drank this brew at room temperature to give everyone my full experience info and honestly Im glad I kept it that way. The taste had apples, yeast, ginger, cinnamon and I want to say vanilla? It's a very interesting brew and it's actually growing on me the more sips I take. I feel that this brew was very pleasant and at the price a good deal. It's not among the world class beers by all means but I would say more of a nice autumn time brew. It has a nice fizz in the mouth that lingers after letting it down the hatch. Overall if you're considering this brew my fellow new advocates, go ahead and grab a bottle, you'll be glad you did! Thanks for reading my review and as always beer on my friends.","FrattyNattyKA","Aug 11, 2013"

This is an interesting foray into Belgian-style beer and one of the harshest on the yeast front I've ever had, especially for a dubbel. That was enjoyable to an extent, but definitely a bit much. It was a tad sour from all the yeast, but the malts tasted delicious and the alcohol kick was very discernible on the finish, which I enjoyed. So, all in all, it was interesting and enjoyable, but not really a top-notch dubbel.","ElCommodoro","Mar 12, 2013"

There is a medium amount of spice bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer but nothing all that exciting for an American take on the style.","UCLABrewN84","Dec 23, 2012"

Do not purchase it and think that you are getting a high end superior beer , but if you want to bring your friends along who think bud light and miller lite are the only beer made this might be the one to introduce them to in my opinion , I could drink this while grilling burgers and brats and just enjoy the crap out of life","ubenumber2","Sep 04, 2012"

The bread flavor also comes out in this beer. The taste is complex and well-balanced. The alcohol doesn't come forward in the flavor at all. Plenty of lacing is left on the glass. The body is on the higher end of medium and the carbonation is moderate, making this a very drinkable dubbel. I have to tip my hat to Abita for creating a solid and very drinkable dubbel.

The flavors were similar with clear notes of yeast bread and caramel sweetness along with more subdued flavors of figs, pepper, plum, nuts and some spicy hops on the finish. Complex but drinkable and punchy without tasting boozy; balanced, in short. The mouthfeel was smooth, the body medium/full and the carbonation medium/light.

Big sugary malt on the nose, with a sour fruit scent that gives it a salty olive kinda smell, sugary raisins found all over this beer. The taste is all over the place, from sweet malt, to biscuity malts, to wild cherries, to dark fruits, back to sweet malts. Finishes very well but everything in the middle combines to a big sour climax then back to a sweet finish. Medium on the feel, velvety, sour, high carbonation yet smooth .

The taste is just average. That's the surprise. The smell and appearance lead me to expect a full bodied malty taste. This brew has a light taste that has no hop bite or any other flavors that hit the back of the tongue. All of the taste is felt on the front half of the mouth. The short finish makes the beer an easy one to drink. You wouldn't know that it was 8%.","fostwal","May 27, 2009"
4,9.6,4,4,4,4,4,"Overall it's a really nice abbey-style beer. A little bit more depth of character to the maltiness (perhaps a stronger hint of cocoa or soft milk chocolate?) would be great, and a tighter focus on the balance (softening the bitterness in the finish, and smoothing the sweetness at the outset - eliminating the minor vegetal note) would make this quite nice.

Aroma is a nice amount of brown malts and dried fruits. The taste is an interesting blend of fruits, spice and malt, but a bit on the bland side, as is the case with most Abita beers. The beer is medium bodied with some present alcohol. This one ended up being just about what I expected, Abita's half-ass attempt at a Belgian.","atsprings","May 25, 2009"

Smell is nice, lots of caramel and raisin maltiness, fruity, kind of nutty, some toast and biscuits, lightly grainy, pretty interesting. Taste is similar, sweet and fruity at first, some raisins and brown sugar, apricots and some tropical fruit, lightly vegetal, yeasty, some graininess and caramel in the finish, not bad. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium carbonation. Pretty interesting and tasty ale, although the graininess is something I would say shouldn't really be in a Belgian ale. Still, I liked it.

3.75,2.7,4,4,3.5,3.5,4,"Gargantuan head on the pour, three fingers plus with many super-large bubbles, steadily settles down into a think layer across the surface, leaves a thick, frothy lacing behind. Copper red to brown in color, average darkness. Moderate penetration to the nose, golden raisin, date and clove spice, then fresher peach to banana fruit, cocoa and carob, the malt dimension actually less forceful than expected, allows for a trace of mixed white citrus and something like celery to come through, overall drifts off slowly like a cloud on the horizon. Medium-bodied with a thick foaminess in the mouth, more of a smoky, caramelized character to the chocolate, toffee flavors than in the nose. The banana and esters ratcheted up, less concentrated date or glazed fruit aspects. The clove, nutmeg in the house, yet, the mineral water derived dry freshness opposes the deepening of any sweetness. Not especially yeasty nor bready, there is some moss or wet underbrush tones, again perhaps linkable to the mineral water. A touch monochrome but not a chore to drink.","farrago","May 16, 2009"
2.82,-22.7,4,2,3,4,2.5,"The Abbey Ale pours with a decent head and looks nice. The aroma is a bit off-putting, though. I appreciate the phenolic character of some Belgian yeasts, and there's some of that ""goodness"" in this brew, but there's also some bad phenols as well. (For reference, I would say Chimay red or blue has a very good phenolic character.) The taste is better than the aroma, but the ""bad"" phenols are still there. This is an interesting attempt at an Abbey ale and one that almost works, but ultimately it needs more finesse. Much like the Andygator, the flavors in this brew don't quite gel and makes me think the recipe needs more time to work out the kinks. Well, to be honest, I had Andygator a number of years ago when it was still draft-only. I thought it was ""odd...if not off"" back then, and I still think it tastes the same in the new bottled form. Odd... Whatever the case, this Abbey Ale is a better Abita beer than most other Abita brews out there. Hey Abita, I'm still pulling for you. Seriously, keep trying with the special release bomber series. I still have faith that you guys can make some killer brews!","ohmybock","May 13, 2009"

It tasted like sour wild yeast and salt and apricot, with some banana and nutty malt. It was slightly thick with some carbonation, and had a sour aftertaste. Overall this had a very clean flavor, but it wasn't very enjoyable for my tastes, with a dominent sour character. To me, dubbels should be maltier. It had good body and was fairly easy to drink.

Good amount of Belgian yeast, some burnt toffee and caramel, a touch of chocolate, light raisin, dark fruit, light spiciness. Not really complex, but can't complain. It tastes good.

The scent of malt is strong, with bread like fragrances. The yeast brings it spiciness and fruity esters along for the ride. The taste has the malt at the front, almost like a spicy bread, touches of sweet spices nutmeg and cinnamon, and dried fruit. I am tasting some chocolate, don't why but I am, it then ends mild earthy bitterness. A creamy texture at the front. thinning itself out as it rolls across the palate. A mild dry finish on the back end, with slight crispness to follow. The flavors do not seem to meld together, though the look and feel are very appealing, taste is what makes a beer.
