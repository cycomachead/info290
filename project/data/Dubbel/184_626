APPEARANCE: dark amber color and a bit hazy. average and moussy tanned head with average retention. TASTE: sweet and caramely flavour profile. some spicy notes. medium-low bitterness that lingers into a medium-dry finish. PALATE: medium body with medium-high carbonation.

4.22,7.4,4,4.5,4,4,4.5,"750 ml bottle into chalice, 07/10 printed on the cork. Pours very hazy and cloudy dark ruby red color with a nice 1-2 finger dense and fluffy cream colored head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Spotty foamy lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big raisin, pear, apple, caramel, brown sugar, light banana, pepper, floral, clove, brown bread, candi sugar, and earthy yeast spiciness. Fantastic aromas with great complexity and balance of fruity/spicy esters with malt sweetness. Taste of raisin, apple, pear, caramel, brown sugar, pepper, clove, light banana, floral, herbal, brown bread, candi sugar, and earthy yeast spiciness. Lingering notes of light fruits, caramel, brown sugar, light banana, pepper, clove, brown bread, floral, herbal, and earthy yeast spiciness on the finish for a bit. Damn nice balance and complexity of fruity/spicy ester with malt sweetness; with great robustness and zero cloying sweetness present after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a smooth, fairly slick, and lightly prickly mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with hardly any warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a highly excellent Dubbel! Great balance and complexity of malt and fruity/spicy esters; and very smooth and crisp to sip on. A highly enjoyable offering.","superspak","Apr 09, 2013"

Balances with bready, caramel malts plus hints of cocoa and roasted along with mild ABV so the beer is both fruit and sweet flavored and it all has chance to shine.

I can't think of a fruit that would describe this, but I'll simply call it 'light finish fruit'. Aftertaste is a very solid burned sugar/caramel flavor.

The head dissipates quickly but sprouted nicely and left a bit of lacing and, at least, a fair ring around the outside of my goblet. The aroma has a strong phenolic band-aid note, although it's not unpleasant. There are also strong Belgian stone fruit flavors, a touch of earth and a splash of rum. It's a fruity, sweet beer, like a quad without depth and punch. Again, that sounds critical and that's not entirely meant. I don't always want to drink big heavy quads, but I still prefer them in terms of ratings. While it's more drinkable than a quad, it still tends to make my mouth turn when I take a large sip. If nothing else, Koningshoeven deserves an award for packing this much flavor in a 6.5% abv beer.

It lost some appearance point because of the disappointing head. There were some bubbles atop my glass when it was poured, but by the time the glass was brought to me, it had largely disappeared (not even a skim was left), and I was sitting at the bar! The aroma is rich and sweet, with some caramel and a little bit of alcohol. You can pick up some alcohol in the taste as well, along with sweet grapes. There is a lingering feeling of sourness. It has a light mouthfeel but much more carbonation than I expected. The amount of carbonation and fruit flavors remind me of a grape ginger ale; I'm not sure if that is a good or bad thing.

Poured in to my Westmalle chalice a dark ruby red complexion, with a strong, buttery white heading with substantial retention. Aroma is lovely, made up with vinous fruits such as plum, raisin, strawberry, fig and date. Bits of earth and spice lurk in the corners of the nose. Taste is complex in every sense of the word. More of the same fruit, earth and spice, which has the ability to almost lift the palate up while inside. After letting it swish around the mouth a bit, and after swallowing, there is a slight numbing sensation as the flavors and alcohol marry in the finish. Body is medium, and despite being a beer to sip and savor, is beautiful in its drinkability. As i sat with this beer over the course of an hour, I listened to the monks singing on the Weihenstephaner tour section of the website. Although that brewery is German, and this beer Belgian, I truly felt like I was tasting a bit of history. I would go so far as to say the atmosphere was a bit haunting. A delicate, complex Trappist beer that I cannot say enough about.","jamie2dope","May 29, 2008"

The nose is not nearly as appealing as the appearance with overt sweetness as though the yeast did not attenuate well. After that is the note of old yeast and the distinct leathery note of wild yeast; finishing with fig, spice, and maybe a hint of black cherry and raisin. The nose deceives the taste. The body is full and nicely carbonated, the under attenuation I worried about is not an issue. Wild yeast provide a dominate leather taste and leave their characteristic sour note on the tongue.

Poured it into two La Trappe chalices (also purchased in AMS) for my wife and me. Smelled like a nice dubbel upon pouring, but I was a bit somewhat disappointed at the lack of huge head. It was there, but kinda small and faded fast. Appearance was good enough, a nice dark brown color. The flavor though was amazing. It tasted like a nice blend of cherry and fig.

Very fruity, caramel-tinged aromas complex with phenols, fruits (apples, figs), and candi sugar. On the palate, very fruity (raisins, apples), fairly sweet for the style, with a wonderful nutty undercurrent that crops up midway through the palate. In spite of all the sweetness, there's a cutting acidity throughout, but it doesn't bring to mind hop bitterness at all... instead it seems a bit chemical in nature. That, and the big carbonation, lighten the mouthfeel somewhat, making it lightly juicy instead of heavy, or maybe on the heavy side of medium.

There was an interesting fruitiness that blended well with a great sweetness well balanced by some subdued hops. There was a good yeast bite in the flavor as well. The mouthfeel possessed a great level of carbonation. The alcohol was well hidden, but there was still a slight astringency present, but not too much.

The body is a deep, dark brown, which is practically opaque at its core. Red highlights abound, too. The nose, which I expected to be full of berry and fruit scents like the Ommegang I had a few days ago, is actually quite muted in that regard. Rather, it speaks of rich caramel, with toasted notes. It seems fairly straightforward. The taste has more of a fruit flavor, but in a light and toasty way, with a subtle caramel aftertaste. A bit sour, but only just. The mouth is medium, lighter than many dubbels, with a high but fine carbonation. A nice, mellow, and very approachable dubbel.

Alcohol is also noticeable toward the finish, about the same time as the chocolate becomes noticeable.

Very sweet to taste with dates, grapes, nuts, berries, figs, and perhaps a little syrup and chocolate. A little sticky-sweet in the mouth.

Served lightly chilled. Pours a nice coppery brown with some ruby highlights. Frothy beige head that seemed rather fizzy, like cola carbonation. Good roasted malt aspect to it (slight suggestion of whiskey malt), with some raisiny fruitiness, light fudgy chocolate and woody esters in the nose. Mouthfeel is spritzy, melding well with the robust malt, and an earthiness bordering on woody and spicy. This dubbel is rather remarkable in the sense of it's complexity. Fruity notions like dates, raisins and prune. Never overly sweet or cloying, because a slight vegetal woody astringency in the finish keeps each sip a savory delight. I feel like my heart should be sinking, knowing I'll never have this La Trappe version of Koningshoeven's beer again, but I'm just busy enjoying it. Enjoyable it is.","crookedhalo","Oct 18, 2004"

Taste is mild, lightly roasty hints up front, with creamy caramel locked in battle with crisp dark fruit notes and citrusy hops with some yeasty spicyness. Nice smooth and clean mouthfeel thats close to medium bodied with a light carbonation. Across the palate this is a bit short lived, and not strong at all, quite mellowing and mild.

The initially massive head of tan foam drops to a solid half-inch or more and leaves some very nice (but short lived) lace throughout the glass. In the nose some clear alcohol is present, though not bothersome; along with some rich malt, mild chocolate, soft dark fruit, and a dusting of delicate spiciness. It's gently zesty and then lightly creamy in the mouth as its warms; due to the combination of its medium body and very fine and lightly effervescent carbonation breaking out of suspension. The flavor is rich with soft and ripe dark fruit that's livened by a gently peppery spiciness. Sweetish toffee, caramel and chocolate appear in the finish; and the lingering aftertaste is dry with a residual fruity maltiness. Quite nice! This is possibly the shining star of the Koningshoeven line. The fermentation flaws that are more visible in the lighter bodied and more straightforward blonde and the ""hotter"" tripel are masked here - and even add character to it's peppery spiciness.

Bubblegum laced sweetness upfront in aroma, along with smooth, mellow chocolate and raisiny fruitiness. Notes of dark caramel and clove become more pronounced as the beer breathes. Refined, but appetizing aromawise. Flavorwise, the malt profile is dominated by clean, dark caramel notes from both dark crystal malt and candi sugar. Chocolate malt and bready notes provide secondary contrast and some depth to malt character. Yeast contributions are a milder extension of the aroma, being comprised of light bubblegum esters and clove phenol. Fairly light in body, but agreeably smooth and lightly dextrinous in mouthfeel. Hop bitterness is light, but residual sugars / dextrins remain low, so overall balance is only slightly skewed towards malt sweetness. Finishes relatively clean, with only a hint of yeast derived nuttiness. Not the most complex dubbel, but rich enough in character and light enough on the palate for excellent drinkability. I would not mind drinking several of these. La Trappe Dubbel is reminescent of an English Brown / Dubbel hybrid. This is the 11.2 oz bottle.","marc77","Dec 11, 2002"
