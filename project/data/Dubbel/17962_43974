The kaffir lime leaves and lemongrass compensate somewhat, but for the most part this is just too sweet and boozy to be something I want to consume very much of - in fact, this tallboy is probably a little excessive. That being said, it still tastes quite good - and this is an interesting brew that might be worth a look if you're into Belgian/spiced ale hybrids. Still, I'll be happy to stick with Chimay Red the next time I have a dubbel craving. A creative, passable selection for my 500th review on BA: cheers to 500 more!","thehyperduck","Sep 27, 2013"

The Belgian notes are the most apparent characteristic in the aroma, which gives an understated impression before the taste. The initial taste is somewhat spicy or peppery with notes of corriander and pleasant lime hints that nibble at the sour taste buds on the tongue. Thankfully, the lime is realistic unlike the lime flavoring in certain macrobrews. All of these unusual traits are set against a malty backbone. The unusual flavors in this beer along with a thinner mouthfeel make this beer an odd impression of the style.

While I appreciate the innovative thinking here, it just didn't really gel for me. There seems to be a clash between the sweet malts, dark fruits and spices that just doesn't sit well in my stomach. Still, this one is quite drinkable thanks to the light carbonation, and at 8.5% ABV you pretty much forget what it tastes like half-way through.

The taste holds notes of caramel, burnt rye bread, light lime zest, lemongrass (hey, for once it's actually in the beer!), clove, light fig, and a bit of banana peel. The fruit and grass combine for an occasionally harsh bitterness that tends to clash with the sweetness enveloping it. Luckily, this doesn't happen all the time.

Brawny like a Dubbel, with a hint of broth, which quickly moves to showcase spices of lime leaves and lemongrass; coriander plays second fiddle. Tart bite from the spicing melds well with the malt base. Alcohol jumps on the palate with a sooth- ing warmth. There is a lot of unusual flavor not only for a beer, but for the style; however, it really works here. The result is a very interesting and very drinkable beer.

It tastes like caramel and bready malt, lemongrass, lime, coriander, herbs, and a bit of dark fruit. There's also a lingering bittersweet finish.

The aroma is intriguing, appropriately fruity and tinged with Thai spices; the fusion seems to work, at least in the nose. Lychee sweetness and delicate malty notes of muscovado sugar and honey combine with banana and bubblegum yeast to create a nice foundation for the kaffir lime, lemongrass, and coriander. There is a hint of orange soda in there as well. The flavor is subtle and quite tasty, more Belgian than Thai, but that's probably a good thing; the coriander accentuates the earthy spiciness of the yeast, while the kaffir lime and lemongrass wed nicely to the natural fruity and citric flavors from the hops. A bit thin overall, stronger than it needs to be, and a bit vague - but in general a successful and tasty experiment.","soulgrowl","Dec 14, 2010"

Of course its really a Belgian Dubbel that is surprisingly and delightfully spiced with Kaffir lime, lemongrass, and coriander. The spicing is aggressive and the lime is noticeable but restrained enough to work. Pours a sort of murky dark amber with a fair head and no lacing. The smell is heavier on the lime and lighter on the spices while the taste is the other way around. The sweetness and richness of a respectable dubbel blends well with the Thai flavors. Not only would this go well with curry, it tastes a little curried itself.

Less head, more alcohol, less lime. Still uncommon. this might not be what you think of when you think abbey dubbel, but it goes really well with foods that have a lot of flavors going on.

4.13,15,4.5,4,4.5,4,3.5,"Pours light hazy brown with a giant creme colored head. Smells of Lemon, Limes, Bananas, Coriander, and Crystal Malt. Tastes the same but with Chocolate. Nice Citrus finish. Very original and interesting. I'm not a huge fan of Coriander, but I'd still definitely recommend this.","TheBlackMallard","Jan 17, 2009"
3.95,10,4,4,4,3.5,4,"Poured a medium and cloudy amber color with a small sized off white head. Aromas of gerneral herbalness, lemongrass, some spices, and limes. Tastes of the same but the herbalness wasnt as strong and some citrus too. I wasn't getting the normal profile I would expect in a dubbel.","hopdog","Dec 08, 2008"
4.5,25.3,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"This is an exciting, uncommon beer from Uncommon Brewers, certified organic, with locally sourced ingredients from the Santa Cruz, CA area. I look forward to more innovations from this brewer.","Beerenauslese","Dec 08, 2008"
4.35,21.2,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"The taste is very nice, very interesting, with caramelly fruit-whole wheat bread, citrus, rum, spices and raisiny spiciness. It's sweet, zesty, and a bit spicey, but very smooth, with the alcohol warming and not harsh or overpowering. It has a definite abbey/dubbel character, but with a lot of flavour and s lightly different quality to it. It's very nice with quite a lot of flavour. My main complaint is that alone it is a bit too sweet although they suggest pairing it with SE Asian food and I can see how this would work really well.","Offa","Dec 05, 2008"
3.4,-5.3,4,4,3,4,3,"Pours a dark cloudy copper brown. Thin off white head that disappears quickly. A whiff of malt and no hops in the aroma. Taste is unique-a very very candy sugar sweetness coats your tongue, and you can really get the lemongrass and Thai spices when you taste this beer-and this for me is the saving grace of this beer ad sets it apart from other doubles-however, I find it difficult to drink an entire can because it is so sweet. Mouthfeel is medium and drinkability medium-I like this beer but I wish it were more drinkable.","bradybeer","Dec 02, 2008"
4.04,12.5,3.5,4.5,4,3.5,4,"Overall a nice, creative dubbel that has helped to partially restore my faith in the ability of a Santa Cruz brewery to produce good beer.","illidurit","Aug 31, 2008"
4.28,19.2,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,"On tap at Mission Pizza in Fremont. Served in a chilled pint glass. Great lookin' beer. Amber with a nice sandy colored head which left some impressive lacework down the glass. Aroma is somewhat muted but I'm picking up a little malt, a little banana. Wonderful flavor...big malt, nutty, grainy, nuances of raisin and banana. Medium to full bodied with a smooth mouthfeel. Very well done. Tastes a little stronger than the 8.5 listed here. I would definitely recommend this.","Rzzzzz","Aug 23, 2008"
