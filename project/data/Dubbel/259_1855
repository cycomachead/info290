St. Bernardus Prior 8 is probably the more 'traditional' of the two dubbels included in this pack, with a more malt-forward, fruity flavour that includes more residual sweetness and yeasty spice then can be found in the Pater 6. They're both outstanding beers that all Trappist beer fans should consider must-tries, and even though I consider this one to be (objectively) the better of the two, the Pater 6 is still more tailored toward my tastes, and probably my favourite.","thehyperduck","Jan 04, 2015"

4.1,-1.2,4,4,4.25,4,4,"One of two regular dubbel offerings from St. Bernardus. Single bottle snagged from a mixed 6-pack and poured into a goblet. A murky light cola brown brew with a large beige head. Aroma is intensely spicy and fruity but with a rum and raisin meets chocolate malt undertone; smells a bit ""darker"" than some other dubbels but with a pleasant rock candy sweetness. This translate well to the palate and I am enjoying where this particular Belgian is going. Brown bread, clove oil, perhaps some dried apricot or papaya and a unique note that recalls chocolate macaroon. Remains only semi-sweet, however, with the chocolate coconut and cola-like brown spice flavors remaining on the dark side of the ledger as opposed to the cloyingly sweet. Rather brisk carbonation and the body is a hair heavier than other dubbels, yet the drinkability remains high like Chimay Red. Finishes on the dry side as well but with some lingering vanilla and dry chocolate wafer notes. I like this beer as a bridge between the lighter-bodied dubbels and some of the heavier Belgian dark ales. Great balance of sweet and bitter.","CalgaryFMC","May 01, 2014"

The taste is disappointing as there really wasn't much complexity and flavor I expect from belgian beers. This was light bodied, which could be considered good to some, but for the style i'm expecting a fuller beer. The taste I did get was a little bit a chocolate and slight bit of dark fruits. Overall, this is an solid beer, but I wouldn't take it over most belgian dubbels. (84/100)","CTbrew32","Apr 20, 2014"

Subdued light malt, dark and light fruit aroma. Light fruit, malt and Belgian spicing. Somewhat light flavor. Finishes nicely with sweet malt and light fruit. Mouth feel and carbonation are very nice. A great dubble, although the flavors are not as assertive as I'd expect. I'd still be happy to drink this any time.","LiquidAmber","Jul 04, 2012"

I like to start these out a little colder than recommended, and let the taste gradually enhance as it goes on, and this, even cold, had a very nice flavor. I had one of these the same weekend I had a Rochefort 8, and while this is the minority opinion, I found the Prior 8 exceedingly more tasteful. I've had the St. B quad, but this was my first time with their dubbel, and this is now my favorite dubbel, hands down.","BuccoFan","Jun 25, 2012"

The Prior 8 has a dark caramel color and the big head as is common with the St. Bernardus products. The aroma is good, but could be bigger and have more of the Belgian yeast that I expect out of a Belgian beer. Good flavor, but overpowering in a raisin flavor note. Lacking the big rock candy flavor that ruins some dubbels (in my opinion), but too much of the raisin flavor and not enough complexity. Not enough Belgian yeast coming through (but I did not swirl the yeast in, so that may be my fault). So the rating is good, but I was expecting more.","iSip","May 07, 2012"

Aromas of big apple, grape, raisin, prune, dark candi sugar, molasses, pepper, toasted biscuit, and yeast spices. Fantastic and standard dubbel aromas with great complexity and strength. Taste of big raisin, prune, caramel, molasses, biscuit, clove, pepper, dark candi sugar, light chocolate, roasted nut, and yeast spices. Lingering notes of dark fruit, molasses, apple, candi sugar, clove, and yeast spices on the finish for a good bit. Fantastic flavor balance and complexity; with no cloying sweetness. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a fantastic fairly creamy and slick mouthfeel. Very smooth to drink but is still a sipper. Alcohol is very well hidden with hardly any warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is an absolutely mind blowing Dubbel. Fantastic flavor complexity, balance, and super smooth drinking.

This beer was really drinkable, at first I didn't think it was going to be because of it's sweet aroma but it wasn't that sweet in the flavor, it went down very smooth and had enough flavor to hold my attention, if I wasn't sharing this with my brother I don't think I would have any problem drinking the whole bottle. I liked pretty much everything about this beer, it is just about everything that a good Dubbel should be. What I liked least about this beer was the high amount of prickly carbonation, it wasn't that bad I just wish it wasn't so prickly. I would for sure buy this beer again, mainly for special occasions, it's got good flavor with some good drinkability to go with it, I recommend giving this beer a try, it has all the aspects that a good Dubbel should have. This was a nice beer to celebrate my birthday with, it had some nice complex flavors without being too big and boozy, if I had more I think I would be content with drinking this all night. Those monks really have this style down and this beer showcases what years and years of hard work can do, this is the best Dubbel I have had to date and I can't wait to see what their Tripel and Quad are like.","StoutHunter","Jan 11, 2012"

While this is a good beer it not no exponentially better than the lesser ABV example and I would lean toward that one so I can imbibe in more of it. If you want a more ""flavorful"" darker Belgian beer, opt for the 12 over this 8.","claspada","Dec 27, 2011"

Clear, chestnut brown color with a frothy off-white head that retained and laced well. Aroma of sweet malts and sugars, with notes of dried fruits. Taste was pretty much what I'd expect from a dubbel: candi sugar and caramel, lightly toasted bread, tones of dried plums and raisins, and a touch of vanilla. A bit of noticeable booze.

Not much in the way of aroma, but what is there has a biscuit and caramel tinge. Moderately full bodied flavor, with caramel, molasses, some fruits such as apricot and pear. Very well balanced, smooth through the swallow and finishing slightly dry. No rough edges. Mouthfeel is equal to or slightly better than the 12, but has a letter less complex character. May vary based on batch, storage, and age characteristics. Another great brew from St. Bernardus.","xodin","Feb 24, 2011"

Pours a deep, reddish-brown with a foamy two inch, cream-colored head. Clarity is a bit murky and there are tiny yeast particles evident in solution. Nose is earthy and vinous with dark fruits (prunes/figs/raisins) rounding out the middle and the back. There's also a dull spicy/herbal/minty quality in the mix, but it is difficult to nail down the precise character. Taste follows nose - pretty much the same character, with the residual earthy/herbal/yeasty quality lingering between quaffs. Mouthfeel is light-medium, with an even and pleasant background carbonation and a semi-dry feel.

It becomes most prevalent in the finish, where it combines with the yeast notes of clove and allspice as well as the caramel malts to produce a complex, almost woody, rum character that lingers on the palate.

The taste is rather sweet up front, with something akin to banana coming up behind. There are also hints of a wheaty quality, possibly from the yeast flakes, but tasty regardless.

On top of the cake of bubbles are some brown specks, could that be yeast? Also suspended in the beer are some floaties that I would also imagine is yeast from the secondary fermentation. The aroma here is of a roasted, bready and a biscuit malt profile that has a nice fruit scent, candy caramel is there as well. The flavors of the malts are nice, my palette is telling me the same as my nose was - roasted and bready malts, dark candy, fruit, along with a nice yeast presence. Has a nice warming feel, but in no way has and alcohol flavor, well hidden and as I finish this really sneaks up on you. This brew goes down very smoothly and all I can say is I am so happy I was able to finally track this down, not sure why I had such a hard time in this area finding it.

Neither interpretation is bad per say, it's simply interesting that there is such a contrast in the same style. I don't think this is noticed in styles such as IPAs, Belgian Witbers, or Hefeweizens, for example. Overall, this one is quite an excellent beer, regardless of style.

Smell is definitely that of a solid Belgian, got the malts, some fruit, raisins and some yeast, smell is kind of subtle on this brew. Tastes of raisins, a sort of toasty taste in this one, some sweets, fruits (apples again), spices and a decent alcohol presence, but a tasteful one, it is definately balanced by the other tastes.

There are some dark fruit/fig tastes for balance and it finishes slightly dry thanks to some roasted malts, but overall this a medium to heavy bodied beer that is sweet.

The beer appeared a dark red-amber when held to light and was a bit clouded due to the yeast sediment remaining from the bottle conditioning process. The aroma was lightly fruity and sweet- the distinct tart odor of the Belgian yeast came through and offered a complex and appealing twist to the blend of scents present. The carbonation is high, but feels good to the inside of the mouth, tingling all over, and the overall mouthfeel is smooth and substantial, but not so thick as to linger long on the tongue after swallowing. The flavor is nice, true to the name of a dubbel; very good and well balanced.

The mouthfeel struck me as superb, nicely balanced, bitterness is muted but in the mix with the malt and yeast. Slight hints of dark fruit start to emanate with more tilting of the glass, green or dark cherry from a brandy fruit cake but with sugars well in the background so the sweetness never takes on a life of its own or becomes cloying. Overall, a real treat for north american tastebuds, beers like this distinguish the true beer lovers from the party animals and the uninitiated.

Plenty of baked bread, yeast, malts, vanilla, grapes, apples, pears... It was like a nice farmer's market on a Sunday. Oh God, the taste. Exquisite. Not overly complex, but a blend of different flavours, all getting an equal share. Plenty of fruits, caramel, bit of honey, breads... Even a bit of a flavour I can't quite put my finger on.

I know I couldn't get all the smells because there are so many, but hey, I tried. Taste starts off a bit metallic which I didn't enjoy that much. Once that goes away, some sweet caramel sweetness takes over. Some nut bread flavors blend well with the fig and raisins. Good taste, but the Westy has the edge in taste in my opinion. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a creamy carbonation. Not as pillowy as the Westy 8, but still pretty good. I'm drinking a 750 mL bottle and I don't see a probelm finishing it at all.

Nose was lots of dried fruit, raisins in particular, and that cookie scent common to a lot of Belgian dark beers. Flavor is similar. Lots of cookies, a dose of chocolate, honey, butter, deliciousness. A touch of warming alcohol in there. Body was full and creamy, appropriately carbonated.

Poured in to a large red wine glass a brownish red color, with a beautiful white head that lasts throughout. Lots of tiny air bubbles make their way towards the top of the glass. Aroma has traces of buttery sweet bread, brownies and dark fruits such as plum and date. Taste reveals tons of fruit, dates and figs being the most pronounced of the bunch. Sweet honey can be tasted in the middle, followed by the sweet bready character at the end. Mouthfeel is creamy and medium in body. Seems like an easy beer to drink but I have a feeling that the ABV might catch up to me after this glass is finished. A lovely Dubbel, and one of the best I have tried in a long time.

Mellow dark caramel and banana esters as well in aroma. Bourbon laced sweetness upfront, followed by nutty malt and hints of toffee. Dark, ripe figs and prunes add a dark fruity overlay. Well calculated light bitterness leaves a pleasant residual sweetness. Moderate in body and mearly perfectly smooth in mouthfeel. Understated banana esters and clove. Finishes w/ a hint of buttery malt and fading yeast must. Prior 8 is quite a tasty brew. It's not overly complex, but rather soft and tremendously balanced. Akin to a milder version of Rochefort 8.

The taste is sweet malt, a little yeasty, wonderful fruits popping through, not too much hop flavor except maybe on the end. It is your typical Belgian in that there are plenty of candied sugars used in the fermentation and that is what makes this beer what it is. The after taste is smooth, there is some alcohol notes coming through too, but mostly on the end, but not really that much for a beer with 8 ABV.

This beer has many similar elements evident in the quadruppel, but somehow they come across as flaws here. Carmel malt pez candy is the obvious one. Sugar in the Raw.

Quite intense and pleasant aromas of fresh baked wheat rolls, yeast, ripe pears/apples, caramel candies, toffee along with faint hints of buckwheat honey, spices, charred oak and alcohol. Palate is full and round combining a nice spritzy carbonation with an enjoyable chewy texture. Flavor profile seems a bit more reserved compared to the aroma, but still quite good. Notes of sweet Belgian crystal malts, light brown sugar, caramel, toffee, spices, fresh dark wheat bread and ripe light fruits are savored. Finish shows just a quick hit of hops and alcohol, but unfortunately tends to fade out fast leaning toward some thiness in the end.

4.27,2.9,4,4.5,4.5,3.5,4,"Poured from the 330ml bottle into a St. Bernardus goblet. Body is an orange/brown hue with deep golden highlights, topped by a small, creamy tan head that doesn't last very long. Nice, sweet aroma that's spot on for a Dubbel - sweet malt, caramel, and some tangy Belgian yeast. Palate is superb as well, with a good balance between the sweet, bready malt flavors and the mellow, fruity hops. Just a touch of astringency is detectable on the finish. Body is creamy but overly foamy. On the whole, though, a very enjoyable offering from one of the greatest breweries in the world.","ElGordo","Feb 08, 2007"

Some fruit and caramel, but it was faint. Similarly with tastes, there were some nice subtle complexities, but nothing grand and tasty. It was a mix of tart, sour berries, with bitter candy.

Not quite as fruity on the palate, with rich grains taking their place, contributing molasses and maybe some carob.

About one finger on refil pours. Fantastic head retention, that leaves some brilliant, very delicate looking lacing. Not as aromatic, as I expected. Mostly a bready, yeasty, with hints of fruits and alcohol. Fruity tastes up front, maybe green apples, malts, and spices. More flavors show themselves as the beer warms. Smooth, creamy mouthfeel.

Tastes of home made root beer as well with some green grass, plumb and over ripe apple. Finishes with a dry spicy character that materializes out of the original flavor.

Flavors of roasted nuts, heavy and full malts, a marked brown sugar element and yeasty bread notes keep the palate occupied and happy.

Rich, well aged malts blend into the sweetness for genuine complexity even to the nose. Alcohols swirl into the aroma and flavor. Looks rich and sweet. Clings to the glass to promise richness. Dehydrated fruits are distinguished and flavored with mild spiciness. Alcohols edge into a fusal flavor that dominated the flavor midway through.

I am so impressed with this beer, that it makes me shy away from making Dubbels because I don't know how I could come close to this.

The head dissipates only slowly as the foam clings to the sides of glass. Aromas of rasins, spices, sweet malt and a bit of cinnamon are present. It smells almost like a fresh cinnamon roll. The taste seems a bit lackluster after expecting such good things from the aroma. It's only subtly sweet, although I detect notes of raisins, coffee and a hint of chocolate. Not real bitter. It has a rich and foamy mouthfeel, semi-thick and very smooth. Overall I prefer the St. Bernardus Pater 6 over this one. This brew smelled wonderful to begin with, and the flavors were there, but they just didn't come out with enough strength and complexity.","bennetj17","Jan 20, 2006"

The taste closely resembles the aromas with the addition of an astringent flavor in the finish that draws out the fruity sweetness and imparts a rough and rather powerful aftertaste. The texture in my mouth starts off rich, but turns into a slightly bready and stickly texture.

Had a St. Bernardus triple the other night which made me remember how good these beers really are... So I'm trying the whole line again. Let's see how the Prior 8 stacks up. Dark brown, cloudy (I poured in the sediment), and as usual for St. Bernardus, the head on this beer is outrageous, and indestructable. Another quality found in all beers by this brewery is the amazing cup-cake like smell and taste... so subtle, so fruity. Nice and malty as well, with a slick raisiny feel. A nice spicy hop background balances. A little kick of alcohol in the finish, but gentle. The mouthfeel is a pillow. So good. Don't know how they do it...

A thick layer of very fine foam also remained behind on the sides of the glass. Bready and yeasty, like the others in the St. Bernardus line, and that's a good thing. There's also a bit of spice and a vinous fruit character. Mild flavour with a bit of alcohol warmth in the throat. Spicy with a rich doughy, bready malt character. Chocolatey finish as it warms. Slightly slick. Ripe fruit is balanced in there as well as a bit of raisin. Alcohol becomes a little more forward as it warms, becoming a bit of a distraction.

Some malty notes, slight spice, and faint banana? Maybe? Taste picks up for it though...a champagne-like bubbly combination of candi-ed fruit, allspice, and cola nut. Not nearly as complex as other examples of the style. Mouthfeel is a tad thin, especially in the roof of the mouth. Oh so easy to drink. Nothing is particularly fantastic about the brew, but it is a nice plain dubbel that should not go untasted.","pentathlete","Jul 28, 2005"

Some spices and a certain alcoholic bite in the finish. I had to struggle to finish the big bottle by myself, which means that the brown sugar sweetness combined with 8% ABV becomes a little too much in the end. The big bottles are for sharing!

Taste is wonderful--everything on the nose comes through, in addition to some plums, raisins, butter, nuts, and cloves---all beautifully blended together in malty goodness.

An on-going and rotating offering of more flavorings, plums, cloves, and even some citrus. Belly warming affect, but not overpowering; flavorful and palate-pleasing, this is a winner.

When the light strikes it from certain angles, it appears almost impenetrable and murky; from other angles it is a beautiful clear ruby color. The aroma is an intense mixture of yeast and fruit. My novice nose is not trained enough to pick out the fruits, but needless to say they are varied and intense. The aroma leads into an intense flavor delivered on the wings of a rush of carbonation. Again, I can't pick out individual flavors, but an assortment of dark fruits dominate. I do detect a blast of cherry in the middle. It finishes surprisingly dry with an acidic tartness that I imagine is the lambic trademark (haven't gotten that far yet). Overall, it's a very tasty brew.

Its huge, pillowy off-white head holds incredibly well and leaves solid sheets of thin, creamy lace about the glass. And there's an added attraction in that you can see the thin rings left from each sip within the solid wall. Candy sugar sweetness, sweet wine, caramel, almond, and vanilla reside in the nose; and appear again in the flavor, balanced by some dark fruitiness (black cherry, plum, fig), alcoholic spice, and leafy hops. It's bitterness is restrained against it's sugary malt, but slowly fights its way through to dominate in the finish (although some splashes of sticky malt do linger). This is a rich, sweet, satisfying, and complex ale that never becomes cloying despite its breadth; and has a great drinkability despite its strength. Impressive!","NeroFiddled","Feb 02, 2005"

The smell is beatifully floral and fruity as one would expect from an abbey ale. The taste is very similar to the ABT12, but perhaps a little lighter, and definately lighter on the alcohol.

Mouthfeel is medium to full with the carbonation prickly enough to make it mouth filling. Lots of interesting flavors, candies of chocolate and caramel, slight toffee roundness -- but what's most interesting is the fruit undertones, varied and ranging as deep as red wine-soaked prunes to bright berries with an estery leavening.

This is a very pleasing one that has tons of delicious flavor but not quite as much complexity as I was anticipating. It is a very dark sepia color with flashes of orange at the edges. The head isn't super-charged, but ample and permanent. Not really any lacing. Small grains of sediment, or perhaps they are sunken bubbles, rest on the slope of the glass. The nose is vibrant, toffeeish and fruity. The flavor is primarily sweet, with lots of lush graininess and peppery spice. A lactic funk provokes thoughts of fine farmhouse cheese, and a note of numbing alcohol marries perfectly with the brew. Mouthfeel soft and yielding, velvelty smooth on the tongue. Despite its darkness and robust character, the beer manages to be refreshing. The light cleansing grass twinge at the end makes this a particularly drinkable beer. My oh my, this is delicious, and it's aching to be accompanied by food, either a robust but milky cheese, or a lightly tangy dark meat.

A lot of candied fruit, brown sugar, cloves and other spice. Very tasty. It did, however, have a little bit more carbonation to it than I expected. This doesn't ruin it for me, but it does prevent me from giving mouth feel a 4.5. Overall, I was quite impressed with this one, and I feel they do a nice job of concealing the 8.0%abv.

The taste was remarkable in that it was rich in dark sweet malt flavors and some dark fruit flavors as well. The mouthfeel has that Belgian qualitiy in that it is effervescent but not rough on the tongue.

Taste begins with notes of bread pudding blended with rum-soaked raisins followed by some vanilla extract and a bite of peppery alcohol in the finish.

Very similar to the abt 12, although not quite as sweet, and the fruit taste's are not as discernible. Mouthfeel is creamy and satisfying, although the carbonation is filling in itself.

Lots of different sweet desserty fruits (brandied plums, raisins, chocolate). Flavor: The aroma follows through in this meal of a beer (OK, dessert of a beer) with bready (date nut bread?) chocolaty, and slightly coffeeish flavor.

Sheet lacing all over the goblet is impressive to behold. Aroma is of a classic Belgian of this style. Earthiness, spices such as cloves and coriander, a whiff of alcohol, and the tug of war between the dark fruits and the pineapple/mango/banana. Moderate carbonation tingles the mouth, before seeming to melt like a marshmallow. Taste is not nearly as complex as the nose, or as other St Bernardus offerings I've sampled, but is very well balanced with a hop presence to counter the sweet malt backbone. Finish is clean and a bit dry. Nothing to complain about here, and this one is another St Bernardus that made me glad I bought the 4 bottle sampler pack that included the nice goblet.

In other words, it's a damn fine-looking beer. The smell is nice dark fruit but a bit more alcohol than expected for an 8% abv beer. Raisins, ripe plum, and a hint of cherry are backed with a twinge of tartness. Although the flavor is on the tame side compared to others of its style, it's a very classy/classic tasting beer.

Rather yeasty pour though, watch out if you don't want it in there. The aroma is big, caramel malt and spicy yeast jump out at you with a little candi sugar showing itself here and there. As it hits the palate, spiciness is most noticeable, partially due to the great hopping and partially due to the yeast strain used in brewing this. The big helping of sweetness that balances this out perfectly isn't far behind however. Caramel and candi sugar with a bit of grain. Lots of dark fruits, plum and raisin. Very creamy mouthfeel. The finish has a good amount of sweetness, but the aftertaste is a bit dry and hoppy. A very enjoyable beer, kind of like a toned-down Abt 12. Extremely drinkable.

4.25,2.4,4,4,4.5,4.5,4,"Chestnut brown color with a frothy off-white head. Rings of lace permeate the chalice glass. Bouquet features dark fruit, yeast, sweet malts and fruity esters. Taste features an amalgam of sweeter flavor profiles including dates, plump raisins, and brown sugar, all while finishing with amildly assertive hop twang and a rush of alcohol. Mouthfeel is creamy, smooth, and luxurious. This is a very drinkable dubbel ale from an outstanding brewery.","Jon","Aug 29, 2003"

4.13,-0.5,4.5,4,4.5,4,3.5,"This beer pours a cloudy brown color with a nice full head and just a little lacing on the glass. The aroma was very fruity with some yeast and alcohol notes. The flavor is very much the same as the aroma. It is fruity, malty, and slightly spicy, but very smooth and enjoyable. This is a very nice Belgian.","clvand0","Aug 14, 2003"

3.83,-7.7,4.5,4,4,3,3.5,"Murky dark brown, tan highlights thick beige head, over a fingers worth. Excellent retention; rings lace. Lovely Dubbel nose sweet alcohol, malty and organic, spicy with fruity hints. Inviting. Pleasantly spicy palate with strong undercurrents of malty alcohol. A licorice note is unleashed midway through with a nice organic finish. The alcohol might be a tad blunt. The dark fruitiness mingles well... there are plenty of subtle nuances. The carbonation is heavy and it adds harshness to the palate. Medium-full body. Overall this is a decent and agreeable beer, it does lack a little but for the cost, it is worth a try.","bditty187","Jun 08, 2003"

4.65,12,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,5,"Pours nice medium head. Settles quickly with good lace. Pretty dark brown. Possibly vanilla and fruit and chocolate mixed in. Really creamy the minute it hits your tongue followed by a good bite. Leaves mouth velvetty and malty. Upfront there is a mixture of fruit and malt. Alchohol is not upfront. Only downfall is a little chemical taste. Not quite as fulfilling as the green(tripel) or blue (abt12) but still excellent. Don't pass any of these up if you have a chance to try","daledeee","May 19, 2003"
4.1,-1.2,4,4,4,5,4,"Poured a color that was a blend of chestnut and ruby. Also had a soft pillow-like head and nice soft lace. Fairly good looking brew. Nose was of grapes, roasted malt, and some notes of coconut. Opens to an oaky character, as well as showed a wine-like alcohol presence. Taste was creamy, though mostly a mellow and lightly sweet malt with a developing nutty-toasty taste. Had a soft mouthfeel and a moderate length finish - quite lush, it really reinforced all the flavors. Soft and barely drying, this beer became earthy with time. A good dubbel, could have a more pronounced profile.","nomad","May 03, 2003"
3.7,-10.8,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"St. Bernadus Prior 8: A creamy tan head sits on top of a murky brown beer that light cannot penetrate. Fairly strong aroma, smells of raisons and other dried fruits. Although I’ve not had great luck with brown beers from Belgium, but this beer tastes very good. Its got nice malt characteristics that add a nice sweetness that tends to supplement the yeast flavors that are so characteristic of this style of beer. The dominant tastes are the dried fruits noted above. The body is light, but this beer is somewhat carbonated. Very nice.","jackndan","Apr 14, 2003"

3.98,-4.1,4.5,4,4,3.5,4,"This beer poured a dark amber color and formed an off white foamy head that disapted leaving circular lace. A medium amount of carbonation is present. An aroma of malt and caramel. A flavor of malt, caramel and slight touch of butterscotch. A fairly light finish to it, with little elements present that make up the flavor and aroma. A good beer, but not the best by this brewer, however.","Wildman","Mar 05, 2003"
3.82,-8,4,4.5,3.5,3,4,"Beautiful, opaque burgandy brown with a high tan head and wisps of lace. Incredible aroma of freshly baked brown bread , cherries and plums. They should make air frsheners that smell so good! Initial sip dissapoints - a bit thin with a peppery carb bite up front, not alot of brown malt or candy sugar flavors. Some hints of licorice and coco and a tongue clenching hop bitterness and sour cherry notes on the finish. 8% alc./vol. is hidden well in this medium bodied and very drinkable Abbey Brown.","Shiredave","Mar 01, 2003"
3.88,-6.5,4.5,4,4,3.5,3.5,"This beer poured a cloudy brown with rich, thick, light tan foam that left lace on the goblet. The smell was malty, biscuity, and yeasty. The taste was malty with a hint of musty grapes (and some yeast if the sediment was poured). The hop character was modest, but there was some floral hop flavor. The mouthfeel was creamy, clean, and warming. There was a slight tartness also. The drinkability was good.","UncleJimbo","Feb 09, 2003"

4.03,-2.9,4,3.5,4,4.5,4.5,"Hazy dark crimson hue. Creamy, thick beige head. Loose lace. Soft, yeasty aroma w/ subtle notes of fig and cinnamon. Hints of chocolate and raisiny sweetness. Mellow dark caramel and banana esters as well in aroma. Bourbon laced sweetness upfront, followed by nutty malt and hints of toffee. Dark, ripe figs and prunes add a dark fruity overlay. Well calculated light bitterness leaves a pleasant residual sweetness. Moderate in body and mearly perfectly smooth in mouthfeel. Understated banana esters and clove. Finishes w/ a hint of buttery malt and fading yeast must. Prior 8 is quite a tasty brew. It's not overly complex, but rather soft and tremendously balanced. Akin to a milder version of Rochefort 8. Most worthy of a 750 ml portion-- 11.2 oz teases the palate.","marc77","Dec 25, 2002"
3.97,-4.3,3.5,4,4,4,4,"Taste follows through on the nose - chocolatey, nutty, maltinmess with a definite decoctionlike flavor, hints of banana and vanilla in the background.
