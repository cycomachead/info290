I was expecting some of that malty sweetness to come through but it ended very quickly.  I thought the mouth feel was a bit too bubbly, almost soft drink fizz.

3.04,0,3,3.25,3,2.75,3,"Average in the glass, it is a clearish dark brown with a thin off white head that settles quickly and laces a bit. There is quite a bit of caramel and a bit of toasted malt in the smell, the background may also hold some belgian yeast character as well but if anything it is weak. The taste is dominated by the caramel as well, it's a bit slick with maybe a touch of metallic twang in there as well. Really no bitterness to speak of as this beer is sweet all the way through with a slightly sticky finish that really doesn't do much to invite the next sip. The body is heavier than I would have expected but the weird flavor combinations and finish prevent a higher score in this category. Overall this isn't very good I see how this may appeal to hardcore Blue Moon fans but I'll leave it for them.","fank2788","Dec 28, 2013"

But, it's basically a coors banquet beer with some specialty malts added. Ok, that might be harsh, but I definitely taste the 'coors' in it. One of those beers that you buy on a impulse just to try it, (cause it is on sale, even though you know it's not really craft beer) drink the 6 pack, say "that was decent", and then never buy it again.","ortovox","Nov 23, 2013"

3.13,3,3.5,3,3,4,3,"Pours a clear copper with a foamy khaki head that settles to an oily film on top of the beer. Foamy streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of toasted malt and caramel aromas. Taste is much the same with a malty flavor on the finish. There is a mild amount of roasty bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is an average beer that is drinkable but pretty one dimensional with emphasis on malty aromas and flavors.","UCLABrewN84","Mar 27, 2013"

I guess Blue Moon at best is a transitional brand that could introduce drinkers from a pure light lager style to one with more flavor.

2.65,-12.8,3,3,2.5,2.5,2.5,"Smells mainly of malty toasted grains, with just a hint of spice and fruit at the edges. Fruity malts are the first flavors to come across on the tongue, blossoming in fruit esters such as orange and apricot. These esters are followed almost immediately by the tang of the "Dark Belgian sugar" mentioned on the label, which adds a nice caramel layer to the fruit. Light vanillas and toffees may also be found here. The hops don't seem to really kick in for me, which is surprising since the original label description said that there were "multiple hops" present. Either the recipe has changed, or the hops are simply too weak to be immediately noticeable, and instead constitute a slight background fuzz. For me, the ale's weakest point comes near the end: all of the fruity, caramel flavors fade away, leaving only a stale beer taste on the back of my throat. If I had to rate only the first half of the mouthful, I would have given it at least a four--but the aftertaste is only a one.","jondeelee","Aug 09, 2011"

3.28,7.9,3.5,3,3,3.5,4,"Pours a solid brown color with amber highlights at the edges, tight off-white head that settled into a sparse cap. The aroma is of a light roasted malt and sweet candi sugar. The taste is of light roasted malt, grainy, enough dark candi sugar to balance out the grainy flavor. Definitely a BDA in 2008, it appears that they may have changed the style over last year, according to the reviews. The feel is moderate with prickly carbonation, quite balance perhaps tipping towards the sweet end. Not a terrible abbey ale, has some roasted flavor and sweetness but lacks the belgian yeast spice. Easily drinkable.","Gmann","Oct 25, 2008"
3.47,14.1,3.5,4,3,3,4,"Poured into a chalice. Nice clear brown look with a tight head. Carbonation is fair. The head dissipates rather quickly. The aroma is of sweet candi sugar, caramel malt, and a bland brand of dried fruit. The taste is a little weak with the first couple of sips, but then after half a glass the flavors of chocolate, sweet malt, and slight tartness come through. The body is a little weak. The coating of the mouth and slick aftertaste hide the body after the first brew. A great session beer that I would drink at least every winter/fall.","phishgator","Oct 24, 2008"

Atop the slightly hazy honey-coloured body it offered promised, but is a letdown, much like the nose that lacks character beyond basic wheat and sweet. The flavor profile logically follows, with an active carbonation leading an artificially sweet wheat with a touch of citrus bitterness that melds together in a rather incongruent way. Read into it and it comes off more like pear than berries. The thin and watery body does not help. A bastardization of Blue Moon, not a winter warmer, far from a Belgian's complexity or darkness, nor interesting in a good way. Reeks of marketing capitalizing on a brand name's proven formula. Stick with the original.","ism","Nov 13, 2007"

I like a more assertive aroma from my beer, light hoppy scent, just the merest hint of spice, malt seemed to come through the strongest. Taste was the same, not very assertive. I agree with some of the other reviews that this is less an attempt at crafting a good winter ale than it is an attempt to garner some of the Winter Ale market share without offending anyone. A little better than most large brew concoctions but no need to worry about cluttering your walls with awards on this one.

In all actuallity, the beer begins with an aroma that's chocked full of raw cereal grains and with a peculliar acrid, chalky character due to added sugars. The beer holds no depth into anything abbey-like. However the beer does have some underlying malt / barley flavors and aromas, decorated with a dry spiciness and light fruitiness (apples and peaches). Beyond that, the hop character may offset the sweetness, but offers no flavor / aromatic qualities. Is the beer a disaster? Well, no. But it surely falls short of it's timid claims. It's drinkable because the flavors are quite clean. But it's a far cry from true abbey-style beers.","BEERchitect","Oct 26, 2007"

If they can manage to bolden those flavors, make some things stand out, and replace the blandness with some character, then this could be a winner.

Frankly, I enjoyed the winter warmer that was released directly under the Coors label. It struck me as being a bolder, a bit spicier and a bit more flavorful.

3.48,14.5,4,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"Come to think about it, this is a lighter version of the style just like regular Blue Moon White is a light tasting version of a wit. Not bad for a change of pace type beer. Did someone say crossover beer?","Redrover","Nov 24, 2006"
4.67,53.6,4.5,5,5,4,4,"This was a very enjoyable beer to say the least. My buddy picked up a few and immediatly, because he does not like many beers, I thought it was going to be either exceptional or well below par. I was however pleasantly surprised with the taste of familiar winter flavors in it that I did not expect and a smell that that was equally pleasant. I would suggest this a beer to appreciate and enjoy but I couldn't have more than two at a time because I felt as though I was being selfish or spoiling myself. Bottom line though: if given the chance definatly partake in this one.","Burdman","Nov 24, 2006"
4,31.6,4.5,4.5,4,3.5,3.5,"Served in a pint glass, the Blue Moon Winter Ale pours a copper color with a good sized off-white head. Nice lacing too. It smells sweet, like caramel, brown sugar, vanilla and fresh baked cookies (yeah, I know that sounds weird). It has a nutty taste, along with caramel and vanilla. It does have a slight bitter/sour aftertaste (which gets less bitter/sour as the beer warms), but overall the taste is mostly sweet. The mouthfeel is light and a little bit creamy. The drinkability is good too, but I don't know if I could drink more than 2 or 3 at a time. This is a pleasant surprise, I really wasn't expecting too much from this but I think this is a decent beer.","bluejacket74","Nov 22, 2006"

4.35,43.1,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"I tried this beer on tap at Sky in Sudbury, MA. I was surprised at how much I liked this beer. The head was creamy and the mouthfeel was full. It has a gingerbread aftertaste that I liked. It reminded me of Anderson Valley's Winter Solstice of several years ago. I hope this is available in 1/6ths!","thornside","Nov 02, 2006"
