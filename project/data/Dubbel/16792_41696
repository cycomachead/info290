3.25,-7.4,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,3.25,"It just doesn't have the same ring to it that the visually-impaired rodent trio does... Anyway, this stuff pours a clear amber-garnet topped by a half-finger of off-cream foam. The nose comprises rich caramel, dark fruits, light molasses, and a bit of Belgian candi sugar. The taste brings in more of the same, with some extra candi sugar, a couple black cherries, and a twinge of green apple way in the back. The body is a straight medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a slick feel. Overall, a decent dubbel at best, one that just doesn't fully sit right with me. Maybe it's a bit sweet, maybe it's the fruit on the tongue, I'm not fully sure. All I know is that I won't be demanding another any time soon.","TMoney2591","Jun 03, 2013"

4,14,4,4,4,4,4,"Poured into a stem glass, a dark mahogany color with a small off-white head. I actually inquired if I was poured the correct beer, because the appearance (and aroma) seemed very deviant from a typical dubbel. Aroma rich with caramel, molasses, and cocoa. Taste was, well, really good actually, though totally not what I expected. Rich and velvety smooth, with dark malts and chocolate up front, almost reminiscent of a sweet stout, mellowing out mid-palate to reveal more of the molasses and sweet dark sugars present in the aroma, with touches of bready yeast, cherries and plums. Surprisingly complex and very tasty. Medium-bodied and very drinkable. My friend who was with me ended up ordering 3 in a row, and I would've done the same, but I like to diversify when I'm at the bar.","Rifugium","Beers"
3.45,-1.7,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"Bottle: Poured a deep hazy brown color ale with a medium size foamy head with OK retention and minimal lacing. Aroma of caramelized sugar with very subtle fruity ester is OK. Taste is overly sweet for style with notes of caramelized sugar and light dry fruits with some notes of fruity ester. Body is quite full with OK carbonation and no apparent alcohol. This one is kind of average for the style but definitely lacking some of the subtlety that makes dubbel such a great style to being with.","Phyl21ca","0"

4.33,23.4,5,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a pretty, hazy amber color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of fruits, banana, yeast.

3.95,12.5,4,4,4,3.5,4,"O- Solid beer, a classic representation of the style, nothing too special, but not one to turn down either. The 7.0% ABV is well hidden and this is drinkable brew, just wish it stood out form the crowd a little more.","ToddT","Feb 26, 2011"
3.6,2.6,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"I could have easily had another one of these after I finished this, since it was that mellow. This isn't a session beer but for someone who's never had a Belgian beer before, this would be a good introduction to a Dubbel. No spice here means that this is a textbook example of the style and certainly a step up from the previous Boaks beer that I had. Nice to see New Jersey finally toss their hat into the ring in brewing this style!","JerzDevl2000","Jan 22, 2011"

Aroma has sweet candied sugar and caramel malts on top of the Belgian yeast backbone. Dark fruits come through as it warms. The taste is similar to the aroma with lots of yeast and sweet caramel malts. Candied sugar, figs and raisins also come out in the flavor. odd sour taste that i wasnt expecting.

3.8,8.3,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a weizen glass. Mahogany brown with a big off-white head, but spotty lace. The aroma included maple syrup, molasses, black cherry, and blackberry. The taste certainly featured dark fruit, but also included dark chocolate/cocoa, and dissolved into a tart/sweet finish. Overall fairly impressive flavor variety, but the feel was surprisingly thin for a dubbel. However, the thin body makes for a good 'session dubbel', if such a thing exists.","donniecuffs","Beers"
3.5,-0.3,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into my Maredsous chalice. The dubbel appeared a murky deep chestnut color with about an inch of quickly fading of white foam. Nose and flavor are of dark fruits such as figs, dates and raisins, quite sweet with notes of candi sugar, molasses, yeast, some caramel. Hovering above medium bodied and adequately carbonated. Slightly above average across the board.","ClockworkOrange","0"
3.65,4,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"IMO, it was a good take on a Belgian Dubbel, but I don't think the taste should have been so dry. The fruits were good, but that dryness has to be lowered. I think a six pack of this would be too much, but a single or two would be good enough.","AltBock","Apr 02, 2009"
3.25,-7.4,3,3,3.5,3.5,3,"Aggressive pour yielded a 1/4"" head that vanished almost instantly. Lacing did stick longer but faded slowly. Body is dark and opaque red. Nose is malty, and sweet. Taste is mellow at first, some sweetness there and plenty of carbonation despite the lack of a head. Almost a dry woody taste to it, oak? I'm on the fence with this one, something is missing taste wise, not sure if its too much carbonation on the palette or if it needs to tone down. Maybe tweak the yeast a bit, has more of a German bock mouth feel to it than Belgian ale(which I think is what was implied.)","ballewblake","Mar 13, 2009"
2.35,-33,2.5,2.5,2,2,3,"Notes: I didn't bother to finish the beer. Next to a solid, traditional dubbel, this beer really doesn't compare.

3.09,-12,4.5,3,3,3,3,"Poured a really nice copper/light brown with a darker brown center. The aroma is sweet caramel and malt and taste pretty much follows suit although with a bit of fruit.

2.56,-27.1,3,2,3.5,1,2,"Really excited to find this at my local beer store in both a six pack and single 12 oz. bottles. No bombers were available. I remembered reading an article about the beer and brewery in the Newark Star Ledger some months back, so I picked this up to try it out. Contrary to some reviews, I can't seem to get much of an aroma out of it. It looks like it could be mistaken for a glass of soda. Fizzy, soda-like head that's gone within seconds. Still cold- lots of carbonation, very malty taste. As it is warming, more of the flavor comes through. Lots of raisin, a little bit of caramel. Hints of earthiness as well. Too much fizzy carbonation kills the beer for me. It's a quality beer, but I'm glad I picked up a single instead of a six, I'm a bit disappointed.","Vendetta","Nov 10, 2008"

4.05,15.4,4,4,4,3.5,4.5,"There are a lot of overly-sweet and unbalanced American-made Belgians in this world, but this hits pretty close to the mark. It's a touch sweeter than the likes of a Chimay Rouge, but still holds enough balanced complexity to make it a fine beer. The aroma holds a mixture of perfume and floral phenols with a dash of pepper. The flavor expands with a mild roasted barley flavor, akin to a nut brown, but backed up by sour cherries and blackberries. My only complaint is that to be truer to style, it should be naturally carbonated. Otherwise this is a very tasty, and apparently undiscovered, dubbel. Go buy one.","tempest","Oct 07, 2008"

Finishes slightly bitter with some pine hop presence as well as an ever so slight bit of alcohol warmth. Medium in body with good carbonation. Sticky and sweet, but lacking a lot of the spices and more of a full yeasty bread feel that other Dubbels possess.

The nose is filled with cents of dark fruits and bready yeast, this seems promising. Initial taste is much like the smell with the addition of oaky notes. Taste turns much more heavily towards the dry fruits as the glass warms to room temperature, not terribly complex but still pretty tasty. Mouthfeel is thin, but greatly helped along by carbonation. Overall I have enjoyed it, but there was nothing overly exciting about the beer.","FrognutUnl","Jul 27, 2008"

Nutty, toffee, sweetened toast, raisin, with some light-fruited esters and mild belgian phenolic character. Finish dries out leaving dry chocolate and a trace of ginger rising on light alcohol vapors. Md-full when in the mouth, but comes across lighter due to the fine carb that forms on the tongue. Well balanced flavors in intensities of comparable levels. Some time in the cellar could likely do this beer well to meld the flavors into a cohesive rolling experience. Enjoyable, but the sweet start begins to wear a bit by the end of the glass. Hits the style description very well.","mentor","Beers"
