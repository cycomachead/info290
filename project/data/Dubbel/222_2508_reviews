"Pours a deep clear brown with a slightly ruddy tint to it. The head barely hangs on after pouring but still leaves some nice soapy lacing. The aroma is true to form, with nice dark fruit and deep caramel sweetness, a little hint of spices, and a little hint of alcohol. The taste is even bigger than the aroma and full of all the aroma characteristics. The body is a nice weight, maybe not quite as full feeling as others but great all the same with just a little hit of carbonation on the finish."

"Pours dark brown, leaving a great lace which stayed on the glass throughout the drink..loved the rich and nutty taste as it paired nice with a large slice of Lasagna.. Awesome experience until the check; $10.00 a pint! Can't say it was that good."

"Had on tap. Big caramel and grain nose with traces of anise and dark dried fruit. Brilliant brown under a very creamy, persistent light tan cap. The palate is creamy and laced with dark dried fruit with faint hints of cola and fruit cake. Finishes with a light bitter accent. Medium full body and medium carbonation."

"Best Dubbel I've had."
"It was Okay.  Not bad."
"From a 25.4 oz bottle into a pint glass.  Tremendous foamy brown/tan head threatens to overflow.  Nice slow fade with huge amounts of clingy lace and clumpy head left behind.  Clear chestnut color with few precipitating bubbles.  Nose of sugary sweet malt, dark fruits, and a bit of boozy alcohol.  Mouth is thin and easy going with little carbonation in evidence.  Tastes of bready malt, definite clean alcohol presence on the finish.  Hints of bitterness.  Overall: Great appearance and nose.  Flavor was a bit underwhelming however I have a feeling I had a rather old bottle."

"Very fresh, well crafted, full flavored. Overall a true joy to drink!"

"Pours a clear red-brown with thick soapy tan head, settles slowly with big chunks of lace down the glass. Smell: fig, toast, brown sugar, dates, black pepper, lightly earthy with a note of cola. Taste: toasted brown bread, hefty grain twang, fig, caramel, cherry cola, earthy and slightly nutty finish. Very nice."

"Although a tad sweet, the first impression is of umami. It has the complex aroma of prunes & (I hate to say it, but...) leather that endS up with a taste much more grounded& earthy. It taste much mor uncuous than it feels. A wonder of aroma, flavor & texture"
"Much smoother than the Maredsous 10, and overall very excellent in general.  Tried this at a restaurant in Changsha, China and absolutely loved it.  Beautiful copper color, just the right amount of head and lace and not too bitter as one might expect from 8% alcohol.  No burn going down and a perfect compliment to any meal."

"330 ml short bottle poured into a snifter. A light brown amber hue with a moderate amount of beige honeycomb-like head. Aroma is spicy and sweet, lightly roasted, with root beer or sarsaparilla, gingerbread, light molasses, and candy apple notes discernible. Palate delivers some chocolate and coffee to complement these sweet and spicy elements, a rather bitter yet smooth and rich dubbel, with more body than most Trappist examples (which swing toward the more attenuated) and a pleasant molasses-like or puffed wheat square note in the roasty finish. A sour fruitiness lurks in the background. I appreciate the richer flavors here."

"330ml short Belgian bottle. Chalice glass. Wood & barrel aromas as cap is removed. Brownish dark amber color. Beige foam & close crown showing fairly good retention. Toasted & brown sugar aromas, hints of chocolate, cocoa, herbs & spices to the nose. Malty & crispy upfront rounded by herbal notes. Medium body. Moderately high carbonation. Dense texture & kind alcoholic heat. Slight fruity bitterness, woody hues & dried nuts in the middle. Sweet/bitter finish. Dark fruit & subtle notes of raisin on the aftertaste."

"330 ml bottle into chalice, best before 8/2014. Pours slightly hazy reddish brown color with a 1 finger dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big raisin, plum, cherry, fig, caramel, molasses, toast, brown bread, light pepper, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of fruity/earthy yeast and dark/bready malt notes; with good strength. Taste of big raisin, plum, fig, cherry, caramel, toast, brown bread, molasses, light pepper, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Light yeast spiciness/tartness on the finish; with lingering notes of big raisin, plum, fig, cherry, caramel, molasses, toast, brown bread, light pepper, herbal, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a while. Damn nice complexity and robustness of fruity/earthy yeast and dark/bready malt flavors; with a great malt/yeast balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth and lightly slick/bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent dubbel style. All around nice complexity and robustness of fruity/earthy yeast and dark/bready malt flavors; and very smooth to sip on. A very enjoyable offering."

"O: A little easier to drink than some other Dubbels and there is a nice complexity to both the flavor and smell of this beer. Alcohol is well hidden and there is not as much sweetness as some of the other examples of the style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"330 ml. bottle. Brown colour with red hints when watching to the light. Huge dense head that lasts forever and marks a good lace on the glass. Smell of chocolate, dark fruits, spices, caramel, some wood character, like a port or sherry wine. Medium body, sticky and creamy palate, good carbonation. Taste of chocolate or cocoa, dark fruits, spices, caramel. A bit of an alcoholic finish."

"The beer pours a creamy off white head that dissipates quickly but still leaves a nice layer on the beer. The beer itself is an opaque purple with a little bit of red. The smell has a dark fruit smell balanced with some floral hops. Belgian sugar notes are also present with a bit of a malt sweetness and grain smell as well. The taste is similar to the smell. Dark fruit notes dominate the palate. A floral hop taste is also present but get a little lost in the sugar and caramel malt notes. The mouthfeel is smooth and heavy bodied with some biting carbonation. The beer is actually fairly light with a slightly dry finish. Overall, a fairly good beer that I'll probably revisit again in the future."

"Overall, I'd get this for myself if even better quads and strong darks weren't also available at the same price. It was an excellent experience, though, and I can't thank my wife enough for buying it for me."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I am usually not a fan of this style and I think this is the best one that I have ever had, and that to me says all I need to know."
""
"Great brew. In my opinion this is a hard to beat Dubbel that is generally overlooked. Very complex with perfect execution and consistently good. World class to be revisited with some frequency."

""
""
""
""
"Started great with the look & the smell of the beer impressing in particular, sadly the taste couldn't match the start with the sweetness overpowering the taste in places & the beer seeming a little bland occasionally. It is definitely up there with some of the best looking beers I've had but the taste let it down sadly."

"A very good dubbel."
""
""
"Uma grande dubbel. Ela é da escola mais avermelhada do estilo, e possui uma interessante peculiaridade. Ela me pareceu seca, assim como vinho. Esse foi uma aspecto agradável. É um cerveja equilibrada e bem gostosa. Mais uma ótima cerveja da Maredsous."

"O: very tasty but not overly complex or memorable."

"O: my best friend swears by Maredsous, he says it is o e of his favorites from when he grew up in Belgium. I enjoyed this beer, and it became even more enjoyable as it came up in temperature. As it warmed I found the flavor improved, the spice came out and the sweet finish became more prominent. All in all a very nice beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall it's a decent ale, but not as sweet as I was expecting."

"Thin for the alcohol level and slightly lacking in depth of flavour, I think this might help to give me a hang-over in the morning: water next!"

"The body of this beer is soft and yet it's full without heaviness. The alcohol is sturdy so be careful because it drinks so easily. There is the faintest hint of smoke in the finish and you will take three or four more sips before your are sure. The anise on this is spectacular. I was expecting chocolate and when I realized the anise lightly permeating the drink I was delighted. This beer is like a gentle breath. The bready quality of the malt increases as it warms and this is one fabulous dubbel."
""
""

""

"I was lucky enough to have this on tap at Meadhall in Cambridge, MA. I wasn't aware that it was made by Duvel but after learning that, it was no surprise. Top quality Dubbel. Malty, strong and delicious."

"A well-to-do dubbel, for style. Well-balanced and supple. Booziness is kept at-bay, for the most part."
""
""
"O- Some kind of licquor beer, very well suited for winter time."
"11.2 oz bottle into porter glass. Caramel color with 1"" head. Nice color for a brown ale. Ok smell, surprisingly lemony at first. Also some notes of cedar. Much better with a sharp cheese than a mild one. Great with a Manchego. Not as creamy as I would expect."
"Dark with a medium head. Nondescript smell. Strong, peat taste. Creamy finish in the mouth, starting out with strong malt flavor but ending up with with a nice bitter edge. Definitely (as you would expect) not a light, refreshing summer beer, but very good on a cold night. Great with Manchego! Not bad."

"O: Initially somewhat unrefined but opened up as it warmed. It was probably best at just below room temperature. Never been bowled over by the dubbel style and this was no exception. Great flavour but too light and frothy for my liking."
"Also, take into consideration the temperature. I really enjoyed it the more it warmed up. Take it out of the fridge a decent while before drinking!"

"Remarks: Did not score A, T, S, M at that time; disregard those scores"
""
""
""
""
""

"The taste roars back and gains back my confidence in this beer with its dark fruit, dark malts, and sweet character. But there is this kind of moderate bitterness that sneaks up on the backside resulting in a fine balance. By far one of the top Dubbels I have ever had."

"Mouthfeel: Malty feel and highly carbonated."

"O Good beer. Defiantly European. By which I mean they are not trying to knock your head off with a bitter kick. That being said, still too sweet for my taste."
""
""
""
"This beer looks good, smells pretty good, the mouthfeel let me down a bit. To be sure, it is a really good beer, but I maybe expected touch more complexity coming through and a more satisfying mouthfeel. It has a lot of flavour, but I would not characterize it as 'rich' per say. A good double, and refreshing but there are better examples."
""
""
""
""
""
"A great example of what brown malts can do in a beer without needing to be roasted or dark. I like the brown malts paired with the phenols."

"Overall, the aftertaste kind of kills this for me. It just doesn't taste that nice and has an overt tone of beer (I realize how ridiculous that sounds) and not of the other flavors that similar darker Belgians have for me."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"This is probably my favourite of the three in this gift pack. Give it a try!"

"Brew tastes good has full body and had the looks you want in this type of brew. This is a very good take on the style."
""
"O: Strange. Lots of dark fruit and then it just falls flat on it's face. Has a kind of plain-jane blandness to it. It's not bad, not bad at all. Just oddly thin and simple, not what I expect from this brewery."
""
"It's been a while since I had the other two of the Maredsous family. but I don't remember them impressing me as much as this one. A really great beer and as it warms up becomes better, has now got rid of the metallic aftertaste and it goes down very smoothly. I will recommend and buy again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"M - This is where I had the most trouble with this beer. It's hand-crafted by authentic God-fearing Belgian monks in a stone abbey according to 12th century tradition into a rich liquid. Too rich for my tastes, I took one sip and realized this is going to be a long beer. If, God forbid, they let me run the show, I'd lighten things up. Why so serious, Maredsous?"
""
""
""
""
"On tap at Cheeky Monk in Denver. Pours amber with a short-lived, white head and much lacing. Aroma is of raisins, plums, caramel malt. Body is full and smooth. Taste is dark fruit, spices, toffee and brown sugar. Finish is long and spicy. Excellent brew."
""
""
"I would definitely consider buying this by the keg, but only if the price was such that it was less than other Quads (like La Trappe) or Dubbels (like Westmalle) that I prefer more."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this is a very good duvel."
""
""
""
"Review from 10/2010 notes. Pours a dark red-orange amber. Nice thick white head leaves tons of lacing. Aroma of sweet malt, Belgian spicing and bit of sour. Sweet malt, fruit with a distinct cherry component, Belgian spice. Dry finish. Light to medium bodied. A very pleasant dubbel."
""
""
"Pours a clear orange-brown with a foamy khaki head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Tiny dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, yeast, spices, and dark fruits. Taste is of malt, dark fruit, yeast, and some spice flavors on the finish. There is a mild spice bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer that is tasty and easy to drink."
""
"Overall: I feel this one was too thin without the yeast character I want. Aroma forebodes more than the taste yielded."
"D - This is a well made dubbed that reminds me how subtle the yeast character should be in a properly made example of the style. Very drinkable, probably more so than any version brewed in the new world has managed to be."
""
""
""
"At Milltown. Not really sure about the vintage. Looks and smells like a good Dubbel. Dark body with a white head. Smell is loaded with more raisins, figs, and plums than cherries but the cherries are there. Less boozy smelling than the others. At first it tastes exactly like Westmalle Dubbel, but the yeast really came out as I drank it, and i didnt like it. I wanted more cherries and fruits, and less like eating a yeast packet."
""
""
""
"Medium bodied and as smooth as possible for such a carbonated beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A very interesting and tasty version of a Dubbel. The dark fruits and dark malts play off each other well."

"This beer is best when available from the tap but it is still great in the bottle. This is such a great beer and very consistent. It was a staple at my favorite European style bar here in the states. It has fruity notes and no bitterness. It is amber to slightly dark with a little head. Very refreshing."

"O: A pleasant Belgian dubbel and one that packs a hidden punch as the alcohol is not prominent on the palate, but it makes its presence known through a gradually rising warming sensation deep within.  Definitely a beer to savor, as more than a glass or two will have you firmly in the alcohol’s grip. What we have is a quality Belgian dubbel, on par with the likes of those offered by St. Bernardus.  This is made even better by the fact that it is Wednesday night at O’Bannon’s, and that means half-price Pint Night, so this $8 beer is now only $4 – and you cannot beat that!"
""
"rich rich dubbel. pours last last possible shade of red before it becomes a velvety chocolate brown color, nice lathery white head. smells like sweet toffee and malts, almost like a heathbar cookie, molasses, and a aromatic belgian yeast. flavor is also very complex and layered, with that same toffee tone and a delicate dried fruit sweetness. the yeast is the shiny penny in this beer though, huge bouquet reminds me of late summer, slightly tart and dry too. feel is lovely, good carbonation, fuller body, and a very well hidden alcoholic element. just picking up a bit of warmth as it goes down and settles. this is a great beer on tap, ive heard mixed reviews about the bottled version, but my specimen was exceptional."
"330ml bottle poured into Leffe chalice. Dark mahogany colour, medium tanned head, hazy clung to the side of the glass. Smelled rasins and grape. Tasted notes of red wine, had strong hints of dark chocolate, long slightly bitter finish the 8%abv was well hidden. Smooth texture. Good beer but needs ageing to reach it's full potential."
"Beer is a bit thin on the mouthfeel. It could have been a bit more thick"
""
""
"Okay. Not a bad beer by far but I just don't get that much complexity beyond a very wine like flavor."
""
""
""
""
""
"DOA"

"I didn't mind this brew but I wasn't blown away by any aspects, I think you could buy better beer with less money"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a tasty beer and a very faithful example of the style: almost the archetype of a dubbel. There are better dubbels out there for sure, but there is really nothing wrong about this one. Good in every respect."
"This is a nice sipping beer to be enjoyed and savored."
""
""
""
"Yeah, paying cover sucks, but the stamp tonight is at least interesting... This stuff pours a clear mahogany topped by a bit less than a finger of cream-khaki foam. The nose comprises fig, brown sugar, light orange zest, toffee, and Belgian candi sugar. The taste brings in more of the same, along with some clove, light cinnamon, honey, and very light cocoa. The body is a light-leaning medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a watery-style smooth feel. Overall, a nice, easy-going dubbel, something I could see throwing back a few times at the bar, but not necessarily something I would consider in the upper echelon of Belgian beers."
""
""
""
""
""
"Final Thoughts: While not as good as the Blonde, this is another exceptional brew. I still have the Tripel to drink, and I regrettably get the feeling that it is going to disappoint. In any case, you'll want to give this a shot. I think it would go really well with a Montreal style steak."
"Dr. v.v.good stuff. After dinner sippy beer."
"Overall: Wife says: This is the perfect Christmas beer. Husband says: I agree--or perfect winter beer. A wonderful beer overall."
""
""
""
""

"Drinkability: This beer is a very pleasant surprise. I like this stuff a lot. Complex, well-crafted, and very tasty — I expect nothing else from someone who has made a vow of celibacy."

"Overall: This was a gem, honestly well crafted and not overly complex and might just need to have another here at the Waterzooi. Hope you enjoy as much as me."
""
""
"best before 07 2012, so i assume this is a couple years old. pours dark brown with a very tan head that holds and leaves splotches of lace. nose is cola, spice (licorice? anise?), and mildly burnt toffee. taste is cola, spice, toffee, brown sugar, overripe plum, date, wood, and a touch of roast and booze which translates rum and cokeish. a bit big for what i like in my dubbels, but full of flavor and seems like it has come together quite nicely. medium full body with plenty of carbonation, yet it somehow drinks soft and smooth. alcoholic dark fruit aftertaste with a slight chocolate roast kick in the finish. quite good, but a little hot and lacks real personality."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Excellent dubbel"
""
""
""
"Overall-I will make sure I keep going back to get the same old bottles."
""
"Overall- I was kind of hoping for something a little more fuller. In mouthfeel as well as taste. After pouring and smelling I thought the taste would be bland, but it was not. Still a little more dark fruit would make this much better. I also think the hoppyness is one of its saving graces. 3.5/5"
""
"O: Solid stuff here. Enjoyable and tasty."
""
"O - this is fantastic dubbel that has its own character with the added malty flavours of caramel and nuts, an easy drinker that could quickly sneak up on you and put you on your ass, a great holiday brew"
""
""
""
"O: a nice brew, scent wasnt where i was expecting it to be but everything else was pretty much in line"
""
""
"Drinkability: It's a smooth drinkable beer accompanied with good flavors and aromas."
""
"O: For me, the carbonation is too much, but that doesn't change the fact that this is a really tasty beer with a big aroma and flavor to match. Worth checking out fr sure."
""
""
""

"The taste is more sweet dark fruits, and sugary malt sweetness, with only a touch of hoppiness. Belgian yeasts come through here too. For an 8% ABV, I was surprised it didn't have a thicker mouthfeel. This is deceptively smooth and easy to drink, but it wasn't so awesomely good that I'd want several."
"This was a very delicious beer that can serve either as a nice sipper or can be quaffed with a vengeance! An excellent cold weather drink!"
""
"A good Dubbel but it is a bit strong on the raisin and somewhat medicinal for me, not as carbonated as I would expect either. Just not as smooth as many similar ales."
""
""
""
"Aftertaste: I like the aftertaste, but it doesn’t last long. It is there, somewhat sweet, and then is gone before you know it. What does stick around is the dryness that you get in the nose. The dryness in the nose is that copper note that I was talking about. You never get the copper flavor though, which is nice. Like I said before, not a huge fan of beers made by monks… but I would order this one again. It’s solid."
""
""
""
"Deep ruby/near brown colour, ring of white head, little lace left. Smell is yeasty and full of dark fruit, dark bread and raisin scents, mild funky scents as well. Taste is quite dry and yeasty initially, dark bready malt, fruity, dark berries and over ripe plum, medium bitterness, earthy with a lightly sweet finish. Med-high carbonation, full body, great weight. Solid stuff here, very drinkable and quite nice, not the most over the top dubbel but quality stuff all the way."
""
""
"Overall this is a funny little beer. I certainly enjoy it, it is very well made. Looks fantastic, easy to drink and plenty interesting. But it is not really a Dubbel with all those roasted malts and I frankly have a problem with that."
"Very strong Belgian Dubbel, smells fantastic, tastes delicious, and is boozy enough to provide some nice warming and a drying finish without becoming overpowering. I wouldn't mind a little bit more fruit on the palate, but it's a minor concern."
"The palate opens mildly sweet with a blend of dark brown sugar, a little bit of dark honey and some fruit - raisins in particular. The yeast expression is a blend of sweeter cinnamon and some doughy and yeasty phenols.I like the blend of raisins and cinnamon here, it's quite enjoyable, especially with the rum and brown sugar. The initial sips reveal a mild metallic note, but that fades. Dying on the finish with a mild hoppy undernote (an earthy bitterness), this beer has some sweeter flavors while remaining relatively dry. Medium-light in body with a moderate level of fine, creamy carbonation, this beer feels pretty good on the palate. Fruity, mildly spicy and mildly alcoholic on the finish, this is a very nicely done dubbel. Sweeter than some of the best, but very nice flavors here."
"O- Great brew that I have walked by many times, glad I finally tried it, it is delicious."
"Overall a great beer. Highly recommeded."
"Listed as ""Maredsous Bruin Belgian amber"" at the Blind Lady in San Diego. Glad I was able to taste this on tap. Bottles have not been so impressive."
"O: Overall, this is a good beer. I like other Belgians better, but this is a good fall-back beer that is readily available."
"A pleasing and well-rounded brew. An excellent choice for the cooling of the season. The 8% ABV certainly doesn't hurt it."
"Overall- Great, reasonably priced quality belgian abbey brew that can be easier to find than some other offerings. Great introductory brew for new converts."
"I assume this is the ""dubbel"" as it was designated on tap. Thin, sweet aroma. Flavor was overly sweet with an unpleasant bitter hop finish. Grain and sugar throughout. Really stretched myself to drink most of the glass. Never again."
"It's a solid beer all around. It's good no matter how you look at it, just not quite great...and there's nothing wrong with that."
"Very nicely done; the subtlety is appreciated."
"Honestly, pretty disappointed. The booze is obvious and up front. Not even close in terms of interesting flavor as a Chimay or Rochefort 6 or 8. There are many better true Belgians to be had also like St. fuellien and Monette. Unibroue's darks and Delirium Nocturnum also much more subtle and flavorful."
"An absolute must-try for anyone who enjoys dubbels and ales of this kind. Very highly recommended."
"What a nice treat this one was. I picked a bottle up at my local Giant Eagle."
"The beer pours a medium brown color with an off-white head. The aroma is full of caramel and toffee malt with some dark fruit and candy sugar notes. The flavor follows the aroma. I get some nice raisin and prune notes as well as some brown sugar, caramel and some Belgian yeast. There is a little bit of alcohol detectable in the flavor but it is fairly faint. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. A very nice dubbel."
"This beer arrives a dark brown color. The head is one inch of white foam that recedes slowly leaving rings of lacing all down the glass. The aroma is of raisins, dates, and bubblegum, but it is quite weak given the strength of this beer. The taste is similar to the aroma, but with more bubblegum. The mouthfeel is medium-full bodied with moderate carbonation, and a smooth texture. Overall, I will pass on this beer next time. It is decent, but there are so many great Belgian beers out there that I can't see myself drinking this again when other options are available."
"Overall: Too sharp in the alcohol, not too balanced. This is not the dubbel for me."
"O: It tastes good and sweet. I like it. Hides alcohol well but not entirely which detracts a little of the bitter aftertaste."
"6.10.14 Tried it again. Still about the same, but the metallic is more medicinal this go around. A pretty tasty beer and it would have scored higher this time."
"Decanted from a bottle to a Duvel tulip a deep red-brown body, voluptuous foam filling the glass. Aroma is kind of sweet and boozey... alcohol aroma is strong. Flavor is actually very sweet and candylike... a balancing act of dryness, sweetness, and sourness. Reminds me of a sweet wine in a sense. Pleasant, albeit a tad overbearing. mouthfeel is a little thick and syrupy, astringent at the same time. Overall this is a decent dubbel."
"D - Good smells; solid drink; one step above #6"
"This is very nice brew. The dry part is a bit perplexing as is the lack of nose (I am generous in my ratings, but this one flat out lacks a big piece -- sorry but Jamie Farr wouldn't be able to get anything out of this one). Trying to think of a way for this to work with food and I can't (having this with a black and blue burger and it is ok for cutting thru the fat and cheese and pepper, but not a great pairing; maybe a pear and blue cheese tart? I dunno). This is one you sit with at night and sip over time and stretch out the enjoyment. I have a bomber here and I must say that the 8% is already catching up to me. And the value ($9) is so very worth it."
"O: Tasty, smooth and a well balanced dubbel."
"Poured from bottle into snifter glass. Pours dark amber brown with a medium beige head with thin lacing that lasts throughout the drinking session. Aroma of raisins, plum, grape, caramel malt, toffee and light floral notes. Thick, creamy mouthful reveals flavors of caramel malt, dark fruits (plum, figs, raisins), and considerable hop balance, which is most pronounced on the dry bitter finish. Overall, a decent Dubbel."
"The CPJ"
"Pours a dark chestnut brown with a small tannish head that dissipates to a think film of bubbles. Caramel malts in the nose, with dark fruits and dark sugars. Taste is of caramel and spice, fruitcake, with a bitter alcohol finish for a drying sensation. Complex, and medium to heavy mouthfeel, and quite drinkable."
"I enjoyed this Dubbel but would not rank it amongst the best belgians but definitely in the pack"
"(D)- A good dubbel especially for the price point. Nothing extraordinary, but it fits the bill for the style."
"overall - decent representation of the style, yet this didn't get me excited enough to try it again"
"Very easy to drink. A couple would go down good. Not the best of the style, but still very good."
"O - A nice dubbel, not as rich or sweet as other bruns Ive had."
"Overall. This is a nice one. It's surprisingly light for the alcohol, and kind of refreshing. I could see myself enjoying a few of these, but I don't know if I'd seek it out."
"Overall this is an amazing dubbel that is wonderfully sweet and complex. It is a wonderful beer to spend an evening sipping on."
"Dirtybeerguy.com"
"Pours an amber-brown color with a small bit of off white head. The smell is of raisins, brown sugar, and brandy. The taste is similar, but with an alcohol warmth at the end of the flavor. The mouthfeel is full with a touch too much carbonation. Overall, this is a pretty tasty beer with some interesting flavors to it."
"It was brown with red hues and an average sized, filmy, off white head. Smells great, I got aromas of raisin, molasses, fig and caramel. The tastes consists of some nutty and dark fruity flavors, along with toffee and caramel. It has a medium body and a soft feel. I thought Maredsous 8 was a world class beer that I would love to revisit on a more sober note."
"Overall - A very complex beer with a whole lot of different tastes going on. The beers flavours continued to change as it approached room temperature. The alcohol is extremely well hidden and it has a truly beautiful appearance once poured in a glass. Worth seeking out."
"An excellent Belgian dubbel; I hope to try it head to head with my old favorite Belgian dubbel, Westmalle, and the very similar (I think) St. Martin."
"D: not very smooth, due to the carbonation; kind of airy; doesn't go down extremely smooth, but not unpleasant; still, I'd have to say my limit is 2 at most"
"D Probably not one I'd try again if this is the way it is supposed to taste. I may have gotten a bad bottle, but until I try another, this review will stand. If the second bottle is different, I will update this reveiw. 3"
"My wife said it tasted like, ""the yummy part after biting a toffee apple"". Bright, tart, sour green apple flavors followed by a nice candy-coated, burnt sugar crunch. Fairly one-dimensional, but classic in it's appeal. I would've expected a deeper or more complex mouthfeel, but as a washing-down-lunch beer, this worked out quite well."
"D: Good dubbel with roast qualities and well priced; would buy again. 4"
"O- Quite complex and drinkable at the same time. Overall very well balanced. A very nice winter beer. Maybe just nothing really special"
"It's drinkable, I guess, but I'm not finding much here to make me want to purchase this stuff again. When I think of a Belgian dubbel, this is not what I think of. I wouldn't say it's a bad beer, and it is in fact a dubbel from Belgium but when I feel like cracking open a dubbel, I don't think I'll have this one in mind in the future."
"Out of the 6, 8 and 10 from the gift pack, this oen takes the cake. I've got a real liking for dessert-like Belgians, and this one fits nicely into that category."
"Drinkability: Very good. This is an easy but tasty brew. If anything, it is a bit too sweet/sugary, but mighty enjoyable nonetheless."
"Creamy mouthfeel. An highly pleasant experience with this one."
"Poured from a tap a Kickbacks. Beer is a deep dark orange, borderline brown. Very low carbonation for a Belgian which leads to no head and no lacing. Smells very sweet, but the taste is well balanced. Very drinkable for 8%. Very good example of an Belgian amber."
"D: A great dubbel."
"D: A great sipping beer, not to be taken in quickly. Fairly high ABV, so you won't drink too many. I enjoyed this a lot, but I don't have any urges to hurry back to the store and restock."
"D: Decent to good dubbel. Better beer at same price point I think."
"A little too strained and taut for my liking - though the booze is well hidden, it is perhaps another strong indicator that this isn't something I will be revisiting anytime soon. Well-made, but just not for this Belgian brew heretic."
"O: Very drinkable. A clean beer with a charming toasted quality prevailing. I would put this on the level of Westmalle."
"Pours a deep violet, hints of hazelnut at the edges. Light creamy head, leaves great lace and chunky retention. Ideal. Subtle nose of dark fruits, and slight vinous notes. Fruit esters, dark bread, minor chocolate. Taste is just the same, dark fruits, acidic with some green grapes skins here, and mild chocolate notes. Yeast leaves some lingering dryness, reminiscent of Orval. High carbonation and full mouthfeel, definitely a sipper. Yum."
"Pours a dark clear brown with a decent amount of foam. Tastes of subtle dark fruits with a slight molasses like lingering finish with the brown sugar almost there. Drinks pretty smooth for the 8% alc and it doesn't register in the taste at all. Decent dubbel."
"D - Good drinkability but I would choose a number of other Dubbels over this. That said, I'd have another no problem."
"This is a great beer, only wish is could get this in the 330ml bottle."
"I poured into a snifter to an inch of tan head. It looks brown but when held to the light it is more of a copper color. The aroma is brown sugar and molasses. Of course, there is the spiciness from the yeast. The taste is not as sweet as I expected. The spiciness and the molasses come through, but there is a bready malt taste in there as well. It is very carbonated. It leaves kind of a molasses cookie aftertaste leaving me wanting another sip. It's a solid beer."
"D - Very good beer that I could definitely drink more of."
"O: Does not hurt my impressions of Belgian beers, this is a phenomenal example of a dubbel. I could have another 750 mL bottle easily."
"Drinkability: Great beer to sip on, I will most certainly be having more of this as winter comes."
"It's a sipper, but it's extremely drinkable."
"Drinkability - I was quite surprised with this beer and its appeal to the drinker. I think the beer is a great session beer and i would look to drink it again. I was very impressed."
"creamy smooth mouthfeel, its extremely easy to drink."
"Will definitely need to get another Maredsous mix pack to get this again. I would buy multiple bottles of it in single form if they were available, but this justifies my first set."
"jd"
"Notes: If you have this in your regular food fridge, please let sit for atleast 45 mins before trying. Deffinitely better as the beer warms. If I didn't have a 750ml bottle this might have had a worse review. My second glass was deffinitely better than the first."
"The body is creamy, smooth, and rich. This is one beer not to pass by."
"But the taste is phenomenal. Your mouth will be filled with a surprising freshness of banana ,chocolate, coffee, and other fruits. A great balance of bittersweet hops at the end, which invigorates for more. great prickly mouthfeel asks for more beer. Very drinkable.One great beer!"
"Drinkability: I think the 8% is hidden quite well and doesn't fill you up too much."
"Rich brown/mahogany hue with some ruby highlights and a cream colored head that sticks around till you reach the bottom of the glass. Earthy smell with clove, banana, caramel, dark dried fruit, and a hint of chocolate. Taste is excellent. Caramel and roasty bitter chocolate up front followed by a slightly spiced combination of cherry, fig, and prune. The banana is very faint but always there. Velvety smooth feel despite a pretty fair amount of carbonation. Seemed less sweet than other dubbels I've had, which was a big plus. Really happy to have come across this one...excellent"
"D- Thoroughly drinkable. A nice beer. A good dubbel."
"A really nice after-dinner beer, should work nice with many desserts."
"D-not a bad beer, seems to have a few issues but does offer a nicely balanced approach with a great malt flavor blending with very ripe fruits."
"D: I don't know if this was a bad keg or not, but this beer was not all that impressive (which goes against what people usually have to say about this beer). Perhaps I'll need to revisit it later."
"Carbonation is almost text book perfect in terms of how it balances the aroma and taste profiles. Alcohol is only just noticeable and the beer most certainly settles into itself as it warms up towards room temp. Very good."
"Am awesome nose, but the taste is too dry and bitter to be a good dubbel."
"D - Blown away at how well this one hides the ABV. As previously mentioned, it does become more noticeable as it warms, but it is not offensive. I could actually have more than one of these in a single session, though that could end up being rather disastrous. Highly recommended to anyone looking for a dark, malty Belgian!!"
"D: A strange combination of sweet and sour. A great beer, but not one I would drink often. Recommended."
"It's good in a cold shaker, but imagine it served in it's own, unchilled glassware. This is recommended."
"Drinkability: Maredsous 8 is a darn drinkable beer. I'm finding that my appreciation for dubbels grows with each example of the style I have, and this is a good example indeed."
"Poured a very dark brown with a thin head that left a little sticky lacing on the glass. I really enjoyed the aromas on this brew which consisted of belgian yeast, cloves, dark fruits, caramel, toffee, roastiness, and faint chocolate notes; very complex. Upfront the belgian yeast come thru first on the taste alongside chocolate, plum, caramel, roasted malts, and spice accents. There was also some faint clove and booze notes as well. The beer was medium body with a decent amount of carbonation which had a sweet creamy slight spice but boozy finish. Maredsous 8 drank very good and was complex acroos the board and was a very delicious beer."
"Taste is very light, super dry and malty with a bunch of iron on the finish. Carbonation is light and the body is even lighter. Maybe I've been spoiled by westy 8, but this isn't even as good as my friend Nate's homebrew dubbel!"
"Drinkability it good. Alcohol is well-concealed."
"Although it smelt great I still didn't find this any more drinkable than a lot of others of similar style I've tried but I'm sure it's me and not the beer."
"Smells better than it tastes. Not enough flavor to back up the burn. Disappointed."
"pours a dark mahogany color with a fluffy 3 finger slow dissipating head ..smell is sweet with caramel and toffee roasted malts dark fruits and some spice..taste is dark fruit forward plum fig and currant..next comes some toast and caramel sweet and malty..mouth feel is medium with lots of flavor its on the sweet side and is best served @ 50 degrees the fruit and spices expand with flavor as it warms..i will say i liked 10 and 6 better then this one"
"Nice full aroma of yeasty banana and cinnamon. High carbonation and a slightly thin mouthfeel, especially on the finish. Brown sugar and caramel malt sweetness, hints of spicy banana bread, and a bit of bitterness on the finish. Very tasty and drinkable!"
"drinkability: a nice belgian ale. would buy again"
"RESPECT"
"this beer quite literally disappeared from my glass. dangerously drinkable considering the 8% abv. i'm definitely going to seek out more of this."
"D: Very drinkable beer, bottle was split perfectly between two of us. (1 pint 9 fl oz bottle)"
"Others don't have to agree with me, but I consider this one of Belgium's finest Dubbels. This has everything I love in this kind of beer - a painter's tray of colours, a captivating aroma and a rich, succulent disposition that encourages slow, appreciative sips. There isn't anything that Belgium's other abbeys (authentic or otherwise) have over Maredsous."
"D - This was a pretty enjoyable beer thats easy to drink with a good taste worth picking up sometime to try"
"D: an affordable abbey ale if there ever was one. It may not be the best one out there, but it is still quite enjoyable."
"750ml bottle in a tulip. A thick dark brown, great looking. Taste is bright at first, tough to sort through the carbonation, but there is some date and other dark fruit sweetness along with some roasted characteristics. As it warms it gives way to lots more malt/caramel sweetness."
"Very nice!"
"Drinkability (4): Very solid dubbel, as it should be."
"D: I've had a couple of these now, and I've enjoyed them very much each time. A very nice Dubbel that provides a great range of flavors and aromas."
"D - Really the first abbey I have tried but the hype made me buy it and it was kind of disappointing. Cover art has also changed from the cool black and red to some plain Jane white and blue which made it hard to find so someone should really update pictures on this site..."
"A beer that bears its degree of alcohol in the name, served in a Duvel Tulip glass. Look: Very dark purple color, the foamy head is thick, creamy with excellent lacing. Smell: Figs and purple grapes, like red wine and pine hops. Taste: Roasted bready-malts, purple grapes and spicy hops. Mouthfeel: Hot, bitter fruit, the finish is bittersweet, show its alcohol strenght passing through the throat, robust body with medium carbonation, very similar to wine. Drinkability: Sometimes i thought i was drinking a glass of wine but was belgian beer."
"D: It's very easy to drink as there's neither too much sweetness nor too much alcohol."
"Overall, decent, nothing special."
"D - A delicious brown ale. Would definitely buy this one again."
"Notes - Pairs excellently with sharp cheddar cheese."
"The mouthfeel was excellent: good body without being too thick; just enough carbonation. Maredsous 8 is one of my favorit brews; quite drinkable and always delicious."
"D - Balanced and finishes clean without any one flavor over dominating. This makes for a very drinkable beer."
"Drinkability- It's worth trying. Maybe I got a bad bottle."
"D: Despite a few criticisms and an 8% ABV, this beer is highly quaffable. I'm looking forward to trying the 6 and 10."
"Tastes all fab and whatnot. Damn near a 5, but not quite. Starts with burny fruit: raisins, prunes, and seared bananas. Moves into a middle of aggressive effervescence. The fizziness leads to a Sprite-ish kind of bland sweetnes, though thankfully soon afterwards there's a backend blend of schwarzbier ash, dubble fruit, and pleasantly alcoholic Belgian yeast"
"Overall Impression: Another authentic Dubbel brewed in Belgium. Very nice! MUCH better than their Tripel."
"D - I think that it really depends on what you are doing. Too sweet for an all nighter."
"Post-reviewing Note: After reviewing this beer, I read through some other reviews, and I have to thank DaveJanssen for using the term ""metallic"" in describing the flavor. This is right on with the ""Rochefort 10"" experience I described above."
"D- I tried it, I enjoyed it and will try the others in the series."
"D - Obviously an expertly crafted brew. The combination of the hops and the effervescence in this one make it a very refreshing beer-drinking experience; and add a dryness to the taste. Very drinkable, very delicious."
"Notes: The flavors mix really well and although is is more sweet than anything else, no specific flavor really outweighs another. Really good tasting beer."
"* = ideas from fellow taster"
"Happy I tried it. It does pack a punch."
"I liked it but I had to almost push myself to finish the 10 oz pour."
"Drink is good. I was blown away by this beverage and I think one of the very best Dubbel's I've had yet."
"Not my favorite, but a quality brew."
"Filmore Pub, Plano, TX"
"Carbonation is stingy at a little hard, low-to mid bodied."
"Very easy to drink one after the other for a dubble."
"Overall, too sticky sweet and boozy to want to drink two. Also, carbonic bite. Dimished drinkability."
"The mouth, which inevitably recalls the roasted malt, however, is very strange. It collects suspicion of alcohol, especially whiskey. Some even see the cola in the same suspicions and more whiskey. The nose evokes the same strange combination of flavors, similarly to the finish in warm alcohol. However, this unusual mouth that resembles a mix between beer ""style dubble"" and ""style quadrupel"" is full of generosity and pleasure."
"Found this on tap at the Flying Saucer in Charlotte, NC. It shows a deep, nearly opaque black-brown/root beer color with a fair light brown head and great lacing. The aroma is pretty simple light malt, clean and crisp, wheat-like. The first mouthful brings a well carbonated malty molasses with a pleasant herbal hop background. This is a subtle blend with nice complexity, in a medium to light body and lively carbonation. Pretty drinkable and refreshing. I get some Belgium-esque clove-like qualities in the balance. A quality brew very much worth a try."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied and a little thin with a biting carbonation."
"A different flavour profile to most dubbels I've had, and an interesting deviation from the norm. This could be the dubbel I reach for when I'm after something less sweet."
"drinkability: easy to drink an looking forawrd to having another."
"Reminds me of the Chimay styles, this beer pours a much fuller head than the 10. It turns frothy after some time and collects as lace on the sides of the glass. Darker pour with some amber tints. Tastes of some cocoa grains, spice, smoke, sweet transgresses to a sour fruit finish. Sweet spice is heavy on the tip of the tounge"
"I had this beer once before in Brussels, but this bottle was a 750ml import. It poured a beautiful brown with a touch of red, with a creamy head that outlasted the beer. It had a wonderful aroma of raisins and roasted nuts. The different tastes in this beer are subtle; dark stone fruits with a touch of sour, like black cherries. There are some floral notes in the middle that appear when the carbonation releases. It feels quite fizzy in your mouth to start, but quickly dissipates."
"Pours a clearish red colored ale, average whitish colored head, diminishing. Sweet aroma, fruity, floral. Red fruit aroma. Somewhat syrupy. Sweet floral taste, very carbonated. Somewhat alcoholy, but tempered very well. Not my favorite mouthfeel."
"Side note: had it on draft at the Saucer last night (completely by coincidence -- I forgot this was in the back of my fridge) and I can safely say that I prefer it on draft. I remember it being more crisp, less fruity, and tasting less alcoholic at the bar, but I was a few deep at the time so it's hard to say definitively. Hard to go wrong with Maredsous though."
"Drinkability: I would have this again and recommend this to someone who seeks a yeasty, unripened fruit middle and finish with a dry aftertaste with a hint of malt lurking in the background."
"Taste is rich, dark fruit, bit of sour, figs, dates, bitter finish, a bit of alcohol heat. Mouthfeel a bit on the thin side for the style, drinkability so-so."
"A solid drinkable Belgian brew. I found this at the Morton Williams in NYC, have never seen it before. Quite tasty."
"Overall a nice Dubble but certainly not my favorite (personally). I would like to try this on tap in the unfiltered form."
"Great stuff that should be tried by the Belgian lovers."
"Dark copper/red with an inch of brown foam - mixed bubbles. Nose is sweet caramel malt, hints of grape and ripe fruit, ever so light toast. Winey-grape flavour up front with a big medicinal kick - too much I think. Lots of bitterness, and sharp carbonation. On the sweet side - which is a welcome balance to the other flavours. Body feels light given the intensity of the flavour profile. I don't love this one."
"750ml corker at Fox and the Hound. Dark Brown beer with Belgian yeast in the nose and brown malt, dark fruit like figs and dates, (nothing purple) and molasses. In the taste was dark chocolate and coffee (which is new to me in a Belgian beer), molasses and coriander. Thick and a beer to be savored. I liked the lower carbonation, it complemented the big flavor and did not detract from the beers overall character."
"Cheers"
"Smooth thick mouthfeel, and somewhat drinkable. Overall I'm somewhat disappointed, was expecting more, not as complex as I was hoping."
"Was given this by another non-belgian guy with high recommendations. Very surprised and appreciate it. Diamond in the rough."
"Overall - Pretty good dubbel here. Not my favorite example of this style, but definitely worth trying."
"D: A nice Dubbel from a great brewery. This is a really nice beer. And if you get your hands on the 75 cl. bottle you'd be a fool if you wont buy it."
"Poured into a Maredsous glass with a couple inches of light bubbly head, at least part of which stuck around for the whole show. Smell was... interesting. Dark fruity malts, a bit of spice, and some tangy-ness that I wasn't crazy about. Sipping on this confirmed that worry. There were nice fruity malts (plum, raisin), and some interesting spice (anice, clove), but the the tangy, kinda medicinal background kept me from really loving this one. Definitely a complex and interesting beer that I liked trying, but not something I plan on trying to hunt down in the future."
"Poured an medium brown with a generous head that was retained throughout the drink. The aroma had a medicinal quality along with alcohol and malty sweet. The taste was somewhat sweet, with a bitter aftertaste. Grapes were the only other thing I could pick out. Mouth feel was medium bodied with fairly high carbonation. Drinkability was OK. Not a fan."
"This beer went down way too quickly and I must commend it highly!"
"Overall this one kick ass beer with almost undescribable flavors. I enjoyed this one quite a bit and am sure I will be having it again sometime."
"This is a strange Dubbel compared to what I've had so far. Very malty, with elements of chocolate, caramel, and dark fruits. A much darker look and flavor than your standard Dubbel. Alcohol is pretty much undetectable. Very slight yeast notes, which I found to be unusual for this style of beer. This brew is good, but not great."
"Drinkabilty- certain a very nice and drinkable dubbel, alcohol is a little hot but not overwhelming, definitely a nice example of the style though there are surely some out there that shine a bit brighter with more complexity and richer finish, worth trying and respectable Belgian Trappist brew"
"Overall a tasty and enjoyable sipper."
"Very drinkable and solid, reminds me of a dubbel with a lot of porter qualities to it."
"Drinkability: Oh yeah. Highly drinkable. I'll buy this again."
"Dark chestnut color, filmy head, looks pretty good. The smell is a nice malty raisin type piece and screams dubbel. Unfortunately the taste is heavily dominated by alcohol and the mouthfeel is astringent making this hard to drink. Actually I am disappointed in this beer, the alcohol was just not well integrated."
"Corked and caged 750mL bottle. Hazy tawny amber/brown colour. There was a fine, beige collar and islands of bubbles coating the surface of the beer. Sticky, spotty lace. Malty, fruity aroma. Plums and raisins, bready, toffee, slight alcohol, fairly spicy, toasted malt. I like it. On to the flavour... Pretty much the same as the aroma, malts and fruit, but the spice was more pronounced and lingered on the palate along with sour cherry and toffee. The body was oddly thin and the carbonation was a little higher than average, which made for a decent texture. Light alcohol warmth. This beer was a really nice surprise. The spicy character was unexpected, but was quite good."
"Not a bad offering, but there are many others of this style I'd recommend further in line."
"M/D Easy drinkable, carbonation a bit thin, alcohol is as should be."
"Drinkability is great -- for such a big, complex beer, I'd have another one. It gets some extra points for being both big & drinkable. Very enjoyable, but not overwhelming."
"D: A nice beer overall. I'm glad I was able to try it."
"I think the Maredsous 10 (tripel) is incredible; this is merely very good. I have no problem with that and will have no problem savoring the rest of this goblet."
"Notes: Interesting to find and enjoy on tap but I believe that prefer the bottle (it is bottle fermented afterall!)."
"Pretty drinkable brew, this is one I might like better in a bottle also."
"overall a good dubbel, lacking in the mouthfeel."
"."
"Reviewed on 05/25/2009. Bottle. Pours a somewhat translucent brown with thick light tan head. Aroma of sweet malt, raisins. Flavor of more of the same booze, raisins, sweet malt. Ick. This was very bland and too sweet. Yep, this was a disappointment."
"Pours a dark brown with a thick tan colored head. The head is retained nicely and it leaves lacing all the way down the glass. A very nice strong roasted malt, raisin, molasses aroma with some Belgian yeast and spice mixed in. The flavor is very close to the aroma, a nice bready roasted malt, fig, raisin, molasses taste with a touch of clove spice. The warming alcohol feel and flavor is apparent at first and then fades nicely as you drink. There is a bitterness in the finish that leaves the mouth a little dry, other than that, the mouthfeel is generally smooth and creamy with a good level of carbonation and maybe a little bit on the thin side. Drinkability is great. A great aroma and delicious taste make this one of the best beers I've ever had."
"D- An excellent example of the style. well worth a try."
"Drinkability: Probably the second most favorite beer I've ever tasted. Complex without being overpowering, and the grain takes precendent with hops almost no where to be found. This? This is the beer I was looking for when I said ""There's gotta be something other than lagers."""
"Drinkability - Due to it's sweetness, I could tire of it in a session, but as a single brew or two it's a very tasty double style."
"Served from a bottle to a Weizen Glass (only actual beer glass I currently have)"
"D= This was a great dubbel, almost on par with my favorite example of the style (Westmalle). Very complex and packs a punch yet it is surprisingly drinkable. A dangerous combination for sure!"
"Poured into a goblet for one-finger soapy tan head that left lace patches all over the glass with a dark brown hue. A wonderful smell of caramel, cocoa malts along w/ yeast and some heavy fruits like grape. Smooth and creamy yet has a shaprness due to good carbonation. Also a little bready and chewey. Has some sweet caramelized malt in the beer that gives off some bitter chocolate taste, and finishes dry and husky thanks to roasted malts combo'ed with hop bitterness and some spices and fruit flavors like orange. A complex beer that is well worth the money and was great to sip on a bomber bottle. Beer smoothes as it warms."
"P.S. KEEP YOUR EYE ON THE CORK AND AWAY FROM IT. Just my personal experience. Cheers!"
"I got this in a gift pack with the glass, and I unfortunately can't buy it separately here. I may go back for another gift pack, just to have another one of these!"
"Pretty much a perfect drink!"
"The taste is port, sweet-sour plums, fermented fruit, strawberry and cherry jam, hints of licorice and cola, sweet toastiness, but otherwise, it soon falls a bit flat in character and feel after the initial great start."
"Pours brown in color, clear with some copper notes. Very big light tan head. Great retention. Smell - nutty, caramely, malty, alcohol slightly showing. Taste - bready, nutty. Some fruitiness is there as well. Alcohol is coming through but in the nice way. Great balance, very smooth brew, very drinkable. Great beer all around."
"drinkability is good. well balanced. nice fruity and malty component. i like this one, and can see it getting even better with a little age."
"D. A drikable beer. Not one of my favorite Dubbels, but still a well crafted beer."
"D: A solid dubbel, but nothing spectacular. Very drinkable, but won't overwhelm."
"Drinkability is pretty good here. This will get you messed up quickly."
"D: It was easy to put this down, but I didn't get much out of it. Won't really seek this out in the future, at least on tap. I may consider a bottle, but there's nothing in this experience that makes me feel compelled to do so."
"Drinkability: Before I realized it, this thing was almost gone. I like dubbels; I love this. Light, flavorful, and very aromatic. Will definitely buy again."
"A good Dubbel to be sure, one of my favorites, especially at $6 for 14oz. A pretty good deal."
"Drinkability: This is dangerously drinkable and a dubbel that I'll return to in the future. I could sit and sip my way through several of these in a sitting, but at 8% ABV that is probably not a good idea."
"Beer label reads best by date of March 2011. Poured into a Rochefort chalice. Beer forms a tan one finger head with some spotty lacing. Lovely colored beer is dark brown with a ruby tint. Nose is great with notes of chocolate, caramel and coconut. Taste is heavy malt, dark fruit, caramel, with a mild smokey, alcohol burn experienced during the dry finish. Hops are barely present but are there enough to balance the beer well. Medium body, ample carbonation, and creamy mouthfeel lend itself well to the brew. An impressive dubbel that I will buy again."
"D: I would say this is a very drinkable dubbel. A very nicely crafted brew that I would definitely drink again."
"Served: in a tulip glass."
"4.5 D: This is one of the least boring beers out there. You need to sip it though to appreciate it, but I must say I would mind sipping the hell out of a 4-pack."
"Smell was pretty much non existent but which was made up for by taste which had a nice, full flavor, not complex but satisfying with heavy malt taste, not too much yeast though a hint and enough to be a good (but not great) example of the style...no Westmalle here but certainly drinkable."
"D: It drinks quite easily, but it wasn't that great. The taste was somewhat of a letdown considering the smell. I've had this one served in bottle as well and the bottled version is far better than this one."
"Pours a rich, opaque, light chocolaty brown with a fine, fluffy, pale tan head. Appetizing aroma is fruity and slightly smoky with some yeasty hints. Sharp flavor is strongly fruity, and has undertones of malt and yeast; and it goes down with a smooth, lively texture."
"It is a well balanced dubbel but not terribly exciting."
"Salud!!!"
"An opaque brown pour is topped with a two-finger, somewhat airy, tan head. Retention is excellent, with a slow fade and sheets of lacing left to and fro. Smells of dark fruits (grapes and figs), sweet bread, grain and vinegar. Tastes grainy and malty. Underneath that are some more light fruits and subtle hops. Taste is not as complex as the aroma, but works well. It goes down crisp, with a medium mouth-feel. From my limited knowledge of Belgians, I can say this is a good example of the style. From my personal taste, all thoughts on style etc. aside, I can say this is a damn good brew."
"OVERALL: An interesting and enjoyable brew. The palate was a little weak for me, but the rest of it was simply a tasting enjoyable treat. A drinkable brew I'd definitely get again."
"D- Very tasty, well balanced, complex. perhaps a bit too astringent for me, but otherwise very good."
"Mouthfeel is thin and bubbly. I couldn't drink more than a glass of this at a time...there's just too much going on. I like it as a special occasion beer."
"Revisited on 9/18/09. Served in tulip glass this time. I mostly stand by my original review, but have added to the score in taste and drinkability. A very good example of the style."
"D: Very drinkable considering its style. The thickness makes it take a while, but it's certainly enjoyable. The alcohol is very prominent after half a glass, but isn't bad at all."
"A hugely complex beer. I echo the other BAs in suggesting you let this warm a bit before giving it a shot, cooling it too much will allow the alcohol to take over completely."
"Drinkability: It's tasty and enjoyable enough to hold my interest throughout each of the 11.2 ounces. Well, that was a fairly fine dubbel. I ought to be damned ashamed of myself for waiting nearly four years since the last one. Recommended."
"Notes: A really solid, pleasantly rich, rather sweet Dubbel that proves to be quite complex. I really enjoyed this one a lot! Highly recommended"
"Drinkability - A first-class brew. Truly one of the classics of the style; you won't want to put this one down."
"Good, tasty beer."
"Decent but not very exciting. Best by Sept. 2010 on label."
"All in all, the beer was highly enjoyable. The flavors are so complex and interesting that I felt it was really designed to sit down and enjoy sip by sip. Savor this one, take it slow, and it will be a wonderful experience."
"Over all , beer is good. Alcohol is a bit more apparent than most 8% beers. This is also the case with Duvel imo, so maybe its something to do with the brewery. Still is a decent brew and wouldnt mind having acouple more"
"Drinking from the bottle tonight, it pours a very deep red with a brown hue. The head is thin and has a tinge of beige. Initial smell of oats and cinnamon, perhaps. There's sweet taste behind a light flavor of smoke. A hint of fruit, cherries I think, but not very define. Definitely a different taste from the tap, not as distinct. Just the right amount of carbonation, as not to distract from the flavor. Not the smoothest beer I've ever had, but there's no problems taking it down."
"Off the tap at American Flatbread this Belgian offering was a deep chestnut color. The head was a thick cap of tan bubbles that displayed excellent retention and left very good lacing. The aroma was a complex mix of semi-sweet malt, with chocolate, ripened fruit, assorted dry grains and some alcohol. The flavors were equally complex, rich malt, caramel, light chocolate, fruity alcohol esters, Belgian yeast and a slightly grainy note towards the end along with some floral hops that offered balance. As it warmed up the alcohol came forward and began to quash the complexity. The mouthfeel was slightly watery but exceptionally smooth, the body medium and the carbonation delicate."
"Future outlook: Very good drink, but I can't see myself running out to get more anytime soon."
"The beer pours a dark cherry color with a small head that reduces to a thin cover rapidly. To me, the smell is the 8's strong suit. There is a complex mixture of sweet malts with dark fruits and a hint of the alcohol that comes through more prominently in the taste. The taste seems to minimize the positives of the nose while amplifying the negatives. The alcohol and upfront bitterness are a little too overwhelming. The mouthfeel notices a high carbonation that lasts throughout a beer I spent an hour drinking. It will be something that I revisit from time to time, but not something that I would drink back-to-back."
"Overall: Tastes great and highly carbonated throughout makes this very drinkable. This is almost ideal of what I think of when I think Dubble. Only downfall is it's a bit pricey."
"Drinkability: Absolutely recommend this one."
"Feel is medium bodied, it has enough to stand up to the carbonation and also enough to coat the tongue, creamy."
"-Psilo"
"Very impressive overall and a great example of this classic Belgian style."
"Very tasty Belgium brew, I could go for a 4 pack of these - and do a side to side with NB Abby ale."
"Overall: A very good belgian dubbel! Easily paired with food"
"Nice beer overall and makes me want to try the siblings (6 & 10)."
"Overall- Sweet fruity and warming make it a decent Dubbel."
"interesting and drinkable, but not something i'd seek out again."
"If you can get it, try it. It's worth it."
"This is a great Dubbel. Very complex malt profile with a good balance between sweet and bitter. Worth a try."
"Drinkability is high, a great beer that goes down really easily and hides the ABV very well. The fact that it's a reasonably priced and widely available for an abby style brew dosen't hurt either."
"This is good stuff. It's not something you want to set down a kill a six pack of, but take your time and savor maybe with a good smoke and/or an antipasti plate."
"D - Yuck.. I wish I wouldn't have gotten the bomber. To tart and to much of a plastic type taste."
"D-Great drinkability. I look forward to purchasing a bottle of this and Maredsous's other offerings in the future. Very smooth, extremely complex flavor!"
"d - ho-hum. went well with garlic bread, not so much with steak."
"has a nice orange color to it, this is the 2nd of a sampler i got, and as the first i cant really give it a fair review for its smell (damn smokers) taste is great, a spicy malty brew with a suptle hop taste to it. mouthfeel is good, has a rich full mouthfeel to it, a beer i wish i could get in illinois"
"Dark mahogany pour with a thick off-white head. Deep, heavy aroma of malt, peat, smoke, and molasses. Creamy mouthfeel. Heavy malt, caramel, and dark fruits in the taste. Occasional pop-through of the peat, but not consistently. Long aftertaste. Very nice."
"d- One is enough in a single sitting. Good stuff, but the alcohol can be a little hard to stomach."
"D - A very nice beer, one of my favorite, a classic"
"Bottle from Winking Lizard. Pours a lustrous ruby-brown color with a medium off-white head that has good retention. Patches of lacing on the glass. Bouquet of fruits and spices, as well as some yeast and malt. Medium-bodied with roasted malt, yeast and spice flavors. Dark fruit and hops undertones as well. The finish is fruit and oak with a spicy yeast aftertaste. Solid all around."
"Drinkability: This is certainly an enjoyable dubbel that is quite drinkable. However, I really was expecting a bit more, especially on tap."
"D: Good drinkability at first. But after 3, the strong alcohol taste will stop you."
"A very complex Dubbel: rich, fruity, and spicy. This is quite a tough balancing act to accomplish, but Duvel pulls it off without many flaws. Take my advice and let this one warm to room temperature before enjoying: the spices and fruity esters really come through."
"Overall this is on the lighter side of dubbels in my opinion, and the light tartness is a nice surprise. Worth a shot."
"Out of a 750ml corked and caged bottle. Pours a dark brown color with ruby highlights, thick dense head that settles into a puffy cap. Wine like aromas dominate but are not overly strong, a bit of a metallic twang, and a sugary sweetness. The taste starts of with red wine flavors which is cut by slightly roasted malt, a metallic twang follows, finishes with a nice sweetness. The feel is firm with prickly carbonation, sweet throughout though crisp not sticky, rounds out with a light bitterness. A very sturdy dubbel, hits all of the main flavors spot on. Could use a touch more zest."
"Overall: An enjoyable beer. The flavor does not quite meet the expectations promised from the wonderful aromas and appearance. Perhaps some age would help with that. I would certainly try this beer again. There are enough complexities to suggest many different experiences to be had from resampling."
"Excellent taste, multidimensional and intriguing. Just slightly sweet with some dark fruit, subtle raisin, chicory coffee coming through. A solid bitterness is complimented by a great roasted malt aftertaste-- very dark chocolate. Good tartness, with a strange acidic character that reminded me of wine. You can definitely sense the alcohol in this brew as well. Slippery moutfeel with pretty strong carbonation. A delicious brew I would have again, and again...."
"Overall: a very complex and wonderful Dubbel. Well disguised strong beer (beware!). Very well balanced with a great body and a strong personality. A must have."
"D: Certainly would take another but this is not as good as Chimay and not close to Westmalle or St. Bernardus."
"D; This is easily becoming a favorite beer of mine. It is a nice nightcap or substitute or go along with for dessert."
"Stubby Belgian style small (330 ml) bottle, best before dating of ""09 2010"" on the rear label. pours dark chocolate amber, under a highly retentive, puffy dark tan head, leaving gobs of splattered fingers of lace. Nose is of dark chocolate, bready yeast, and candied fruits. Complex, bold and tasty brew. Plenty of rum, raisins, more chocolate (dark and dry), gooey brownie comes to mind, some alcohol kickin' it in the rear as well as some late hops to dry things out. Nice stuff. I've enjoyed this one for years, just getting around to reviewing it"
"Tasted like dark fruit, brown sugar, some nice phenols, with a yeasty backbone and plenty of esters. A touch of roast/toast in the back and fig that added substance. Mouthfeel was smooth, refreshing but warming. Nice amount of carbonation and warmth, overall a great dubbel. Not the best I've had and not terribly unique, but very well done."
"Delicious and succulent, Maredsous' dubbel is fullish in body with a fine sizzle of carbonation, great feel and excellent drinkability."
"Smells drinkable but I'm disappointed by the way the alcohol dulls the other flavors upfront. Possibly with some aging, this may improve. However, I'm just not impressed with the overall taste."
"D - It's a bit of an asskicker with the abundance of alcohol and huge, strong flavors. Not a bad sipper, but one is enough."
"Mouthfeel has a very creamy quality from the carbonation. There is an alcohol warmth. Very good example of the style. I will be getting more."
"Overall, a very drinkable beer. Delicious brew. Very complex. Wish I had more!"
"Perfect appearance with a reddish/burgundy color with yellow edges. Perfect Belgian head forms great shapes and lasts and laces well. Really light aromas with out much to describe. Nice flavor balance, with a touch of cherries, mocha, caramel and dough. Clean but not vibrant. Light mouth feel. Decent beer."
"Drinkability: This is a great sipper or diner beer."
"Crisp effervescence, almost tangy bite. Not expected. A cola kind of bite to it. Light bodied. Good but kind of odd for a Belgian Brune."
"This was, indeed, an exceptional beer, and a benchmark for other dubbels. I'm eager to find out how much difference there is between the tap and bottle versions."
"There is something about this style that hits me. These are more like fine wine. I'm by no means complaining by the high marks you can see."
"M,D: The mouthfeel is exceptional, a little light, hence the drinkability is high and the ABV is hidden very well."
"Excellent beer, but can be savoured only in small quantities."
"I would call this more of a dubbel than a Belgian strong ale, but in any case it was very good. The head is very good and so clingy that it's almost concave in the glass. Hearty flavors of fruit and spice, with a sharp, satisfying finish. A good dessert beer, though I'd have it any time."
"Fairly nice. Most likely will drink again."
"Considering it's 10:00 am I probably shouldn't be drinking this at all, but even with it's heavy Dubbel Belgian body it goes down surprisingly well."
"D- Easy to drink. Alcohol a bit too prominent though."
"Overall a good dark beer to sip on; probably the best offering from Maredsous."
"D - This is one of the better dubbels out there. Great complex blending of flavors."
"Taste is rich--starts with the sweetly spiced fruits, some malt in the middle and ends slighly creamy. No alcohol is present even in the bouquet--making this a deceptive 8%. In the mouth this is very smooth with flavors melding together very well. Highly drinkable if I could drink more than one."
"Appearance is murky brown with an off-white head that settles into a thin head for the duration. Aroma has moderate esters of black cherry and other dark fruits as well as some malt, a hint of flowery European hops, and that familiar spiciness of Belgian yeast. Taste has some moderate bitterness up-front with loads of dark fruity esters. Can't decide if that bitterness is due to the hops or some weird dark malt or what. Regardless, it's overly bitter and not very smooth for a Dubbel. I'm a bit disappointed but maybe it was the dregs of the keg or something."
"Pours dark brown but very clear. Decent creme head. Spicy flavor a bit. Minor dough. It's mostly spices. But not very overpowering at that. The carbonation bites quite a bit. Liquid feel is decent enough. Nice to drink. Smooth with enough bite to keep it interesting."
"Had this one on tap at Whistle Binkies South. Dark amber brown with ruby red highlights, and would have been a nice amount of foam had the bartender not filled the chalice to the top, but no complaints on that end! Smell of some dark candied fruits, yeast, and apple cider. Taste was similar. Dark fruits, raisins, rum-soaked fruit, spiced apple cider, sweet, and only the slightest bit of hop bitterness. Not a lot of carbonation which made the mouthfeel slick, but seemed a bit watery and light to medium-bodied. I enjoyed it very much."
"d: good with a really pleasant tartness"
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, good kick, good representation of style, this is a nice beer to drink for a while, especially if you want a Belgian with some substance that won't try to hit you too hard."
"There are are better beers but this is a great one."
"Poured from 330mL bottle into one of my Trappist-style stemmed glasses. Immediately noticed the rich color, this is definitely an Abbey Dubbel. Head set up very nicely but not too thick, fairly low in carbonation. Then it hit me. That glorious scent of caramel malt. Very potent in scent immediately upon pouring, about 10 minutes of breathing time and the scent mellows. My first sip of this beer and I immediately thought, ""Wow!"" This is one of the only Belgian dubbels that I have had that wasn't too overpowering on the first sip. Most that I've had usually seem too sweet on first sip so I generally gravitate towards the tripels, which have more bite. My second sip, and I knew that this was a VERY GOOD beer. Mouthfeel typical of most top-quality Belgian styles, almost ""fluffy"" and light while still reminding you how big the beer really is. While this is a very drinkable beer, the 8% ABV is not to be taken lightly. If this had been a 750mL bottle, it may have been too much for a Wednesday night. :)"
"Aroma of burt caramel, cream, roasted sugar and yeast. Flavor is reminisent of a creme brulé served with cognac, rich velvet caramel, pungent earty yeast esters and a delicious dark roasted malt finish. Absolutely delicious!"
"One of my favorite dubbels! Really nice and complex with smooth mouthfeel and great drinkability. Quite a nice sipper, I don't want it to be over."
"Drinkable, but not much above the ordinary, especially for a Belgian. Very nice head, decent flavor, some fruity notes. High alcohol content, somewhat tastable. Expensive for what you get. Good but not great. Other Belgians are worth the price. Decent."
"drinkability - Nice drinker in a snifter. Would buy it again."
"Taste followed suit although the sweet elements were definitely more dominant in the taste. Body was a bit thicker, more viscous than other dubbels I've had. Very in keeping with its appearance though"
"Thoroughly enjoyed this ale but with very little in the stomach prior to this visit...one was certainly enough. If you know what I mean. Will definitely pick up a bottle of this and compare."
"Pours very dark, more brown than russet, with a lovely, thick cream colored head that sticks the glass and the beer. Aromas indicate that this will be a rich, chocolaty dubbel, with sugared figs, chocolate malt, cloves and raw alcohol predominating. On the palate, rich, thick flavors, with bracing, countering bitterness for the sweet malts. Spicy chocolate malts, yeasty fruits and finely honed bitterness characterize the nicely rounded, fulsome palate. This beer really hits all the spots in your mouth. Mouthfeel is excellent -- carbonation is full but not harsh, hop oils present but purely balancing, and the malts tasty. Overall, this is quite a well done dubbel in the thicker, richer style."
"D - a very good beer that is a joy to drink. just not necessarily in large amounts."
"Appearance is a dark red amber in color with a thick head. Smell has the dark fruits and honey. Taste seems a bit dulled for the style, yet still complex with the dark fruits, malts, spice and the alchohol seems well hidden. Mouthfeel is a crisp viscous medium. Not the best I've tried thus far, but also not one to pass up to campare one to another."
"Drink: I don't really think that I would go past one bottle of this, but that one bottle is very gratifying."
"Notes: Excellent brew and something to look forward to purchasing. A delight to drink and a sadness to see it all gone."
"A lot of character to this one and quite a treat. There is a nice warmth from the ABV but this one is doesn't taste boozy like it smells. A fine brew."
"Very nice beer. I find dubbels as a style somewhat boring, but this one packed a good amount of flavor. The Maredsous 10 is better, but I am very impressed by this line."
"D: pretty good, something I could have a few of. I'd recommended it to anyone who might be a fan of the heavier darker malty beers"
"Drinkability: This brew hides the strength well and is easy to drink."
"This is absolutely in the rarer, former camp. Very well done."
"Made by the same brewery as Duvel, this poured a dark burgundy color with a slight amount of white head. It smelled like oak and raisins, mixed with malt and alcohol. It had a very clean and well balanced flavor that mixed prunes with cultured yeast and floral hops. It was watery with slight carbonation, and it had a sweet aftertaste. Overall this was a unique and refreshing beer, and confirms my high opinion of Belgian darks."
"Fruity smell and taste with a strong malt/alcohol finish. The alcohol taste took away from the drinkability some."
"I always look forward to having the ONE-I don't want to make it mundane."
" Pair this brew with some Extra sharp cheddar cheese and some of that malty sweetness that's lacking really pops out much more after a mouthful of this."
"The mouth feel was bitter on the finish, fairly thin and stayed with you for a while. This has to be one of the better Dubbels I have tried. It comes recommended for sure."
"D: A bit different but not terrible. Price was nice, too. I'll still probably stick with others but hey, ya never know when I'll feel a little squirrelly."
"This was the beer that opened my eyes to the world of Belgian ales and will always hold a special place in my heart. A Maredsous hangover for me is not something to be ashamed of. Kudos to the drunken monks at Maredsous abbey, this one is a winner."
"This is a drinkable beer of its style. Well-balanced and easy going down. Not my favorite of the style, but good nonetheless."
"D - I really enjoyed this but I couldn't see having too many in one sitting."
"D - Definitely wanted more, disappointed I did not order this bad boy first. Much better out of the tap versus the bottle. Though with belgians, I usually give bottles the nod over the tap."
"D- good but damn it's strong!"
"A wonderfully complex and rich dubbel. A nice example of the style, and a pleasure to sip on."
"I'd been wanting to try this one for a while after a friend recommended it. Wasn't disappointed. Good dubbel."
"Drinkability: The alcohol is really only apparent in the nose. I could taste it and I'm barely feeling it. This is a lovely dubbel with great character."
"D- I enjoy dubbels from time to time and this is a good one, enjoy."
"The taste is quite nice with caramel, raisen or prune. A tad sour but in a good way. Nice carbonation and a medium wet finish. This is a truly premium beer and I will keep this on my list"
"Will try again, could have been a bad palate day on those first 3 bottles."
"From a short, fat 11.2 oz bottle with a red checkered-plated logo, this Belgian ""8" pours a beautiful purplish-brown, dark chestnut color with a foamy, frothy head... appearance is great... smell is of figs, prunes, plums... Bottle logo claims this is ""dark", a ""Belgian Abbey Ale", and ""Refermented in the bottle""... very good smell, although the taste was good, it wasn't above and beyond like I was hoping and expecting... dark plum and fruit flavors blend with a creamy mouthfeel... taste is more bland than I was hoping for the style, although it did go down well and was satisfying... interesting sample that I had previously never heard of... satisfactory enough to warrant a try, although the flavor did not completely blow me away..."
"A perfect sipping beer; one to be savoured."
"Overall this is a nice Dubbel, one of my favorite styles."
"D - Not filling, but not exciting enough to order another. A good beer, but not my usual style."
"750ml bottle that came with a nice Maredsous glass. Very deep, dark brown color. Thick, airy, persistent head. I honestly don't detect much of a nose at all, but the tongue detects nice complexity; some chocolate, molasses, slight cherry. Not too heavy or sweet. Really nicely balanced. A pleasure to drink."
"750ml corked and caged brown bottle with a drink before date of 11/09. Pours a slightly hazy medium brown with a 2 finger head, nice longeity and excellent lace. Aromas of brown sugar, Belgian candy, sherry, yeast and slight alcohol. Flavors of slight roasted malt with hints of chocolate, sherry and a subtle roasted bitterness in the finish, This beer is not as rich and full bodied as I expected but it is very tasty and makes it a much easier drinking brew."
"Just a note: local Health Dep't reg's in Denver require all beer to be served at the same too-cold temperature, so I had to let this sit for a while before consuming. That's a bit disappointing, but certainly no fault of the beer itself. At the right temperature, this is a very good beer."
"belle bière brune de belle couleur, collet très épais du à l'effervescence de la bière, trop peut-être ? nez marqué par les épices, très agréable. en bouche tout est en rondeur, par-contre si on brasse la bière dans la bouche l'effervescence marqué fait que la bière prend de l'expansion et sort par le nez (sic)"
"If there is a flaw, maybe that it's just a bit too watery. That might be what they were aiming since this is the second Dubbel I've had. Also I didn't get much carbonation after a few swigs. I took all night drinking this one savoring all the different flavors."
"Looks like a standard dubbel with a murky brown body and a short head. The aroma is a of creamy, sweet malts and the taste opens up with relatively bold strawberry and blackberry flavors and caramel. I had this while my friend was drinking a a St. Bernardus Abt 12, and while it didn't have quiet the flavor and aftertaste, it still held up to it for the most part."
"...WIlly"
"This was a nice beer that I will try again sometime."
"Poured out of a 11.2 oz bottle. Very nice dark-burnt-reddish brown color.fruity nose, some dried figs, raisins, caramel, grain bread. Very foamy head that remains for quite some time. slightly bitter at first, long lingering finish. caramel, toffes, alcohol comes throgh in the aftertaste, but is not overwheming gives the beer a nice tart. mouthfeel Tastes so good that I want to just sip and savor."
"Drinkability : une biére correcte dans le style Abbaye brune"
"[750ml bottle poured in goblet.)"
"D- oh god, I love this beer. buy it, drink it and enjoy it."
"I have had this brew for a while now and for some reason I decided that tonight would be the night to give it a try. The brew poured to a nice dark brown color in my chalice with a nice sized dark colored tan head that had nice retention while leaving some nice lacing. The aromas seem to suggest a rich malt scent which seem to have a roasted quality. Also noticeable is a rich fruit like scent that reminds me a little of cherries while a slight chocolate and alcohol smell seems to be there as well. Over all this is a nice smelling brew. The flavors are good, a sweet smell dominates the flavors at first which seems to break a little to a cocoa/chocolate taste along with fruit flavors that seem to not go along with what I was experiencing in the nose, as I am not picking up cherries but more of a fig/date taste. Has a very carbonated feel to it which goes nice. As this brew warms i am noticing more of a alcohol flavor at the tail end which gives it a nice warming feel. Over all this is a pretty good brew one I would get in the future."
"The mouthfeel is so smooth and silky and drinkability is world class. This is one of the best abbey beers in my opinion and will always have a spot in my heart."
"drinkability is very good. this is a sweet dubbel with great masking of the alcohol, while remaining only mildly sweet. this is a solid belgian brew that has a wonderfully diverse yeasty base. cheers!"
"I thought this was an average Belgium Double. Not bad by any means, but not great. There is not a lot of balance, just malt. Overall, a good beer to try at a decent price."
"O: A pleasant beverage that hides the alcohol well, but the thickness gets old after a few.. suggesting progression to something a tad smoother"
"Another? You bet. I would have to take my time though. I think this one will become a regular in my fridge. I'll also try aging one."
"Very tasty, with obvious solid construction."
"Not a typical dubbel, but if every brewer aimed to create a standard things would get boring fast. A nice treat and worth a go."
"Overall a decent brew. Nice sweet choice to compliment smoked brie. Not the most by the book dubbel, but not a bad choice. Give it a try if you see it."
"This beer pours a very dark garnet with a big fluffy head in my Chimay goblet. Aroma is sugary, caramel, molasses and raisins. Taste is dark and fruity, plums and raisins, but a little thin, though there is some good bitterness at the end. Not as complex as I was hoping for. Not that bad, a solid dubbel, but I've had better ones."
"Went down to Barley's in Greenville tonight, and was suprised to learn they have now started using rotating taps of brews! Awesome news as this will only serve to bring in more and more good beers into a place that is already jam packed with goodies. Sat down to order my pizza and was trying to figure out what to order, and I noticed this on tap. Now I hate to admit it, but I had never heard of it before, and had a bit of an issue pronouncing it correctly. I was promptly corrected and proceeded to order. Now this was poured most excellently into a large tulip which bore its name along with a gold lip. The pour was extemely dark brown, opaque with a huge billowing tan head that literally fell over the sides of the glass. I did not think it would actually ever go down. This really looked like a serious beer. It finally settled down but left a ton of lace down the glass for the rest of the session. First whiff of the aroma was very fruity, albeit dark. Hints of apricots and raisins, along with some plum and a touch of alcohol were all readily present. The distinctive aroma of Belgian yeast was ever so present as well. Very nice, floral aroma. First sip was delicous. Very full flavored and lively. Lots of fruity flavors, again figs, apricots, banana, and a nice mellow spiceness melded well with a touch of alcohol that was ever so gently mixed in. Very nice warming feeling upon putting down a few sips. Mouthfeel was superb. Very rich, creamy and thick, great carbonation. I could have sipped this all night, keyowrd there would be sipped. This is defiantly not a chugger by any means. Overall this beer was awesome and exactly what I needed after dinner. I nursed this for almost an hour before all was said and done. I will definatly look for this again when I go back, hopefully it will still be on top, I would love to have some more, and would really love to the try the 10!"
"D- I think this isn't to good at all. There are a ton of dubbels out there that blow this one out of the water."
"I'll try it again but only if its on-tap."
"D: Very good, at 8%, you'll have to watch yourself, but about as sessionable as a dubbel gets."
"Drinks alright, probably needs a few more years"
"33cl bottle into a brandy snifter. Pours a dark, clear red-brown with a rocky, light head. Smell is roasted malt with fruit notes, with cloves & spice to accent. The taste is, again roasted but not much of the fruit that the smell promised. Some spice in the end. Speaking of the end it is very dry. It balances out the initial malt. The mouthfeel is thin for the style, although nicely carbonated. The drinkability is very good, with no real alcohol burn and a balance between malt & hops that makes it very drinkable. The finish gives a nice kick that gets you set up for the next one. And the next. Not the best dubbel but a decent offering from a great brewery. Let's just say I wouldn't kick it out of bed for eating crackers, but I'm not marrying the cow to get the milk either."
"This is a new beer to the central Kentucky area so I thought I'd try it out. The beer pours into the goblet dark ruby red with about 2 fingers of quickly disipating head, which leaves behind legs of lace on its fall. The aroma has hints of chocolate, alcohol, caramel, and grape. The flavor is quite good with less roasted malt than I remembered...a good thing in my mind. The prickly carbonation pairs well with the light body. Hopefully the rest of the Maredsous line is as good as this one."
"D - Not too bad but not overly powerful -- the richness of the malt flavors make it a bit difficult to drink more than one in an evening."
"Poured from a 11.2oz bottle into a snifter. The beer pours a deep ruby, forming a thin 1/2 inch head that faded quickly, leaving medium spots of lace on the glass. The aroma is dark fruits along with a hint of alcohol. The taste is very malty, but not overpowering. Nice amount of dark fruit flavoring, along with maybe a very slight hint of hops. Complex and delicious. Medium mouthfeel and very smooth finish. For a dubbel, this is very drinkable. Full flavor and smooth mouthfeel make this a great drinker. Overall, I was not dissapointed, except for the fact that I only had one of these on hand. This is the best dubbel that I have experienced on my journey through the various Belgian beers available on the market."
"As it poured into a Maredsous chalice, a deep amber even brownish color with a tanish head that left very nice lacing on the glass. Taste and smell; dark fruits and spices (nutmeg and/ or corriander). A very smooth and intersesting beer. Definately worth a try."
"but definitely could be better."
"I knew that Maredsous 8 wouldn't be in the same league as Duvel, but then I've always thought that Duvel is in a league of its own. This is still exceptional beer, though, and is a dubbel that deserves a great deal of respect. I must have liked it because the bottle was gone before I knew it."
"Medium leaning towards thin body on the mouthfeel, which does thicken a bit as it warms. Overall I'd have this one once in a while, but I like it better on tap. Luckily there are a few places around Houston that carry it. The Front Porch had it for 5 bucks a full pint last time I was there, but just be warned it's served ice cold."
"Medium plush body with so much goin-on that make it a 750ml. that I wish would never end...an all-around great beer that's well worth the money"
"Drinkability - I found this to be a very drinkable beer. Probably wouldn't put it on my favorites list but would drink another one. Lots of complexity."
"Drinkability: Given the complexity here, I think this one is best left as a sipper. It's meant to be savored. I wouldn't have more than one of these in a sitting."
"originally got a bottle for x mas 2004, but since then have only had it a couple of times..so on with my favourite drug ed rush...""Mien Godt!!! This is one tasty beer!!! A dark color, frothy as heck head, and a flavor that boggles the mind, a very flavorful beer that i recommend highly! had on tap at a pub...not as good, but still very nice, scores changed accordions."""
"Not spectacular but a very good beer."
"Purchased for $3.19 at Total Wine in Orlando. Short and stubby 11.2 fl oz bottle poured into a St. Bernardus goblet. The appearance is beautiful with a dark reddish brown body with a creamy off white head. The aroma is sweet roasted malt, smokey charcoal, and a hint of banana and dark fruits. The taste is malty and slightly sweet with some tartness coming up in the middle and a dry spicey finish. Overall, this is an enjoyable dubbel that is recommended."
"A very impressive, deserving dubbel."
"Pours am opaque red/brown, some chunkies, thick tan head forms, some lacing, good retention. Smell is sweet, alcohol, fruits, yeast, some bread, caramel, and citrus. Taste is sweet and brown sugary, slightly oxidized, dark fruits, caramel, molasses, yeast finish. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium carbonation, pretty smooth, good sipper. Thanks Jan!"
"D: Very good. Not at all what I thought it would be, but not bad at all. The licourice becomes more and more evident in the taste. I like it a lot"
"Dubbel by the makers of Duvel. Seem to remember trying it in my early days of good beer drinking, but wanted to match it up against the other Belgian dubbels I'd had since. Poured into a weisse glass (I didn't want to fight with the bartender), it had a dark amber hue with nicely layered head, if thin. The smell was subtly malty, but it was weak. Tasted fairly good, richly malty with molasses and sweet fruit up front, followed by the slight metallic sting of alcohol, but a nice long balanced finish atones for the boozy middle. The pleasant carbonation keeps the beer from being treacley, and I'd see having a second at a bar that didn't carry Chimay Red."
"Average. Ill give it some leeway because it was past its BB date, but Ive had other Belgian beers past their date that were much better."
"Overall - A very good example of a dubbel - exactly how i would expect one to taste... recommended.."
"Had on my birthday a couple days ago. It has an awesome head and a great apple phenol smell. Swee and malty. Not as funky as other beligians. Very nice mouthfeel and very easy to drink. It was a great beer to start the night off with. Cost me 4.75 at the bar, but it was worth it. Give it a try."
"Very impressive Dubbel which could disguise itself like a toned-down tripel- nice glowing amber pour with a layered lacing like no other. Belgian yeast aromas- spicy fruity. Dry and sweet on the tongue- sweeter than I expected, but it works well with the extreme spice. Big alcohol presence, somewhat too much, but after a few sips, it fades. Recommed to all for a Dubbel with some muscle."
"Mouthfeel was quite zesty. Effervescent and moderately rich. Easier to drink than I had anticipated."
"D - For years I have dreamed of a better dubbel. I tried many I enjoyed, but they all came up short. Here we have the immaculate exception. All around this beer is just great. My only complaint is that I started drinking it when it was too cold. An amazing dubbel, quite possibly the best (there are still a lot I have to try, but this is far above the rest to date). I will have this again (although having loved the ten and eight, I want to find the six). It is absurdly drinkable. A must try."
"Super solid beer and is great to sip and enjoy its unique and complex flavor. As of late, this is one of the most complex beers that I have had! But give it a try and see for yourself!"
"D: Excellent. This has the makings of a sweet syrupy mess, but the sweetness is very restrained. The malt is roasted and smokey, and the bitter hops are an unexpected treat. Fantastic!"
"A solid dubbel, very prominent alcohol maybe hinders the drinkability somewhat but its still pretty solid. There are lots of better dubbels and belgian dark ales out there though, wouldn't buy this again"
"out there. But by all means get some if it's on sale..."
"D: Starts out boring but finishes quite complex. This beer would age nicely."
"Purchased at Sams on recommendation from another friend of beer. Chilled and poured aggressively into tulip glass. Nice fluffy off white head, which dissipates, lingering in pinky nail thickness around the surface and leaves thick sticky lacing. The color is a dark brown with red highlights. Smell of medium yeasty alcohol esters, sweet dark malts, some raisons, brown sugar, plum, other dark fruits and as it worms up bread. The hops are extremely subdued which is not untypical of the style. The taste is much the same as the smells, except with some apple flavor produced by the yeast and a crisp dry finish with a subtle flourish of bitterness. The hop flavor all though not coming forward balances the malt well and forms an even flavor letting the yeasts character shine a little. Over all a nice Belgian Dubbel, honestly I have not really given the Dubbel style a fair enough chance, but as it goes I would say this is a nice one, worth comparing to others. All that said its an enjoyable drink well worth a try"
"D- Very good beer. At $5.75 a glass I felt I was getting a bargain."
"If ordering from this brewer, I'd prefer a Duvel, but I'd have this one again none-the-less."
"It poured a dark color like a coke with a caramel brown head on top which lasted awhile and the laced the glass. after one wiff of this beer I knew I was in for a treat! It's hard to pinpoint all the smells but there were hints of plums, molasses and some other fruits. the smell is as amazing as the taste! it is an explosion of flavor which is very smooth and drinkable. this might be my favorite Belgian by far."
"poured into a nice goblet with an inch of very sticky head. I could smell chocolate immeadiately, but as I took a deeper smell, a sweet caramel smell seemed to dominate. It was a bit hoppier than I imagined, although they died as i swallowed. I enjoyed the fact that I tasted very little alcohol. Medium body, as the caramel/fruit came through and stayed through the finish. Taste lasted for a good 4-5 seconds before dying away. Very nice beer, wish it had a longer finish."
"The drinkability was great, but as I stated the alcohol was hidden which made it easier to drink. If the alcohol was more present I think I would be more of a sipping beer. Definitely worth a try as it is a great Abby Dubbel."
"WILL be drinking this one again!"
"Poured out a new warm brown color with a big foamy off white head. Nice big lacing. The nose is big malt, withyeast and a fruity roundness. There's a lot going on in the taste: raisin, malt, mollasses, maple syrup, sherry, alcohol, yeast. Has a lot of carbonation, and a big slick oily finish."
"D- a good beer, probly would have more than one in a night, would drink/ buy again, personally I prefer the 10, but still a very nice brew"
"Pours out a deep ruby hued brown with a thick khaki head that eventually settles out almost completely. Leaves some scant lacing along with a thin foam atop the beer. Some agitation revives the head. I smell some fruity esters as well as caramel and bread tones from the dark malt, but there's a rather harsh alcohol presence in the nose. Plums and other fruit tend to stick out most for me, with the pure maltiness playing second fiddle. Finishes a bit astringent and slightly tart. Weird yeastiness in there too. I've never gotten a yeast character like this from a dubbel. Tastes dirty. Mouthfeel is trying to be moderate in body, but ends up kind of thin. A little bubbly. Yeah, this tastes alright, but I'm not sure if I'd buy it again when there are better dubbels available."
"Drinkability: Flavorful and complex, one of the best of the Belgian dubbels"
"Drinkability - this is very, very good, and the only thing to limit sessionability is the high abv."
"Da sipper for me, its bubbly and fizzy which I tend to sip. Id have another, but would probably let it age a bit longer."
"A great Belgian beer and a great value (only $2.29 at Central Market in Ft. Worth, TX)."
"The smell on this one is *totally* sweet malts. There is also a mild nutty smell, as well. The taste, too, is full of sweet roasted malt and that same unusuall nutty flavour. Finish is smooth and gentle with a bit of dryness to it. The foamy cap is staying in place as I drink it and write this review. Excellent head retention in this one. Mouthfeel is perfect for the style, with only a modest amount of carbonation. This is a smashing Dubbel! It may replace Chimay Première as my personal favourite. Delicious. Thanks again, Ding."
"Very well rounded beer. Everything from the appearance to the taste is well done. Don't pass up on this one."
"This beer poured a darkish red color with a 2 inch frothy head. Aroma was malty with a little bit of spicy hop smell. Taste was malty and fruity with notes of caramel, ripe fruit(apples maybe?) and some spicy peppery notes in the finish. Mouthfeel was fairly smooth for a medium bodied brew. Drinkabilty was good with no off flavors and alcohol not too noticeable. Not a bad beer for the price."
"Pours a surprisingly clear reddish brown with off white head, most of which recedes quickly leaving a bit of lace and thin film of head. Smells fruity with a touch of roastiness and noticeable alcohol. Lots of carbonation with a medium body. The flavor is dominated by alcohol, with roasted malt & dark fruits evident. I would have enjoyed this more if the alcohol was hidden a little better."
"D - Very drinkable. This is a very nice dubbel, would recommed for sure."
"D - A good beer that's only let down by its muted aroma. Definitely worth trying."
"Pours a nice deep reddish color with a thick, fluffy light chocolate head. Lots of lacing in the goblet. Nose is of dark stewed fruits, yeast, spice, and wine grapes. Detectable alcohol content in the nose. Palate is port-like in some ways, deep, rich, and sweet. Dark cherries, molasses, and raisins. Nice. Mouthfeel is medium and finishes decently dry. A really good dubbel. Very fruity and complex. This is a good beer for a port wine drinker."
"Deep brown, with a ruby tint. Poured a nice head with quite impressive lacing all over. Smell is of ripe fruits/malts/and yeast. Taste upfront has fruity tones. Ripe cherries, plums, and green grapes. Infused with deep rich malts. A very complex Dubbel. Finishes crisp and dry, and semi creamy. Alcohol warming is also present. An incredible Dubbel and one that you should definitely try."
"Presentation: Packaged in a custom twelve ounce glass bottle similar to Duvel, served in a Maredsous chalice."
"The mouth is full upfront but quickly turns very dry with no residuals. I am enjoying this bottle and will track down some fresher bottles for future comparison."
"adios amoebas"
"Nice beer, worth a try."
"Drinkability: About as drinkable as a richly-flavored Dubbel can get, I suppose. These aren't session beers, after all. Great on a clean palate, but this is the kind of beer to which you don't want to get too accustomed, but rather surprise yourself with every now and then."
"Mouthfeel is full bodied with a creamy, sugary raisin, and yeasty feel that cling to the palate."
"D: Very enjoyable."
"Drink by date says this is good till sometime in 2007. The appearance of the beer is very inviting. Color is maroon with a dark ruby glow. Carbonation is very active. Head is very thick, large, and tan colored. Aroma isn't very strong. An initial dark, fruity wine flavor quickly disapears and is replaced by a bit of Belgian sugar and a hint of spice. Sip starts with a burst of citrissy tartness which turns into s sugary, earthy Belgian malt body. Spices are in the mix, but seem to be content to linger in the background. A touch of alcohol is noted in the finish. Overall, I'm disapointed and think that maybe I got a bottle that was a little off. The flavor wasn't bad, just unbalanced and somewhat watery. This beer will get another try sometime down the road."
"I was glad to be able to find this beer on tap at a local cafe. This beer had a great appearance, a nice thick head that was carmel-like in color, that seemed to melt away and get frothy. It looked like something you wold want to top a Belgian waffle. This great head sat on top of a deep in color but not dark, syrupy beer. The beer had good Belgian flavor, slightly roasted but reinforced by the creamy wheat. Great just about anytime, but I would think of it as a desert beer."
"I used a bunch of this in cooking my dinner for the evening: a Flemish beef stew, and it was quite a perfect accompaniment as I enjoyed the rest of the bottle with dinner."
"Drinkability  This is a hearty, flavorful Dubbel with lots of big malts that nevertheless prove to be well-balanced. It flows nicely on-tap."
"Dark brown with large tan head and lots of thick lacing. The smell is dark fruit and alcohol maybe a little bit of plum. The taste is alcohol and roasted grains surprisingly. Tastes of coffee and none of the fruitiness from the smell. Smooth creamy feel. A bit thin. Good taste. Interesting brew. I'll try this one again the next time I get a chance."
"This beer pours a drak brown with ample amounts of off white head with fantastic lacing and retention. The smell is a complex mixture of dark berry fruits along with some mild hop aromas. The taste is also dark berry fruits and the beer finishes with some pleasant hop bitterness. The beer is fairly thick and nicely carbonated. This is a highly drinkable beer. Very pleasant to drink and enjoyable. The only criticism I could offer this beer is that it could be a little bit more challenging on the palate."
"A good rich, smooth and tingley taste. Hints of honeydew, pear, some mild spices, biscuit, caramel, and malt in the body. Finish was crisp yet coated a bit just enough to let the taste linger a bit. Very easy drinking, however I gave it a 4.5 due to its richness. couldn't have too many of these."
"This beer came a very dark, glowing cherry color with a light, uneven tan head. Smelled of dark raisins and molasses with a strong astringent alcohol. Tasted very sweet at first with red grapes and other heavy dark fruits but quickly transitioned to a stunning dryness consisting of currant, unripe sour fruit, red wine and burnt oak. There was also a lingering alcohol that helped accentuate the dryness. The mouth feel was light and dry with an easy small carbonation. When this was in my mouth, it felt heavy, but the dryness seemed shield me from any stickiness, making it seem much lighter than it actually may be. Ive never had anything quite like this. Its delicious and really pleasant to drink."
"Poured into the appropriate Maredsous snifter glass, this is a clear reddish brown beer with a small white head and sustained lacing on the glass. The smell is primarily of prune. While prune figures in the taste, thankfully it is not dominant. This has strong brandy flavor, with cherry, plum, and the aforementioned prune flavors mixed in. Additionally, there is a lingering malty aftertaste. These flavors blend beautifully together. This is a strong ale(8%)and tastes like it. While I probably would not have more than one in a sitting, I would thoroughly enjoy that one. This is an excellent Belgian ale. Highly recommended!"
"This beer went very well with my marinated ahi tuna with a salad in a citric vinegerette."
"drinkability - good. it doesnt get old or boring, its complex enough to hold your interest.its probably wouldnt be my first choice, but its better than most beers. i didnt taste or feel the abv too much, so you can safely have a reasonable amount, enjoy it all the way through and not get drunk."
"The first sightings of this beer in the Lexington Ky area. Peaked my curriosities. A good beer, thought quite ordinary against other great belgians. Looks a solid brown with mohogany highlights. A lightly tan head with dense and varying carbonation decorated the pint. Aromas of candied malts, berries, fruits and spices create a tart and sweet aura. Flavors don't disapoint. Fruity, nutty, with a touch of chocolate, spices, and twang. Feels carbonated, lightly alcoholic, drying, and sweet on the toung. Finishes malty sweet without becomming thick. Hides alcohols well. A good choice for a belgian, but if you want something unique or challanging, this beer may not help."
"Had the bottled version of this beer in a beer tasting event. It pours a cloudy amber brown with a good head that says around. Noticed yeast sediment in the bottom of the glass, which doesnt bother me one bit, I like unfiltered beers. Nice bouquet of caramel, fruit, and spices. I can tell that this is a blended beer, it has a complex flavor that give hints of each style interlaced. Sort of strikes me as a blond version of a Flemish Red. I really like this beer its tasty and very drinkable."
"Drinkability is good an enjoyable Dubbel, certainly worth trying if you haven't."
"Opinion: This is just a well made beer! The flavor isn't super bready like a lot of Dubbels are, so it leaves the palate able to comprehend something beyond the yeast. There is a definite sweet backbone in this beer that is really pleasant. I get a spiciness in the beer that I think is just yeast derived and not from actual spice additions...however I may be mistaken. Regardless this is a really nice beer, and one that I would definitely recommend."
"a good brew...comparatively, i think i like belgian darks better. but this is way above average."
"This brew was a nice find. I had never tried it before and it is relatively inexpensive. Some unique flavors, but the carbonation is a bit too much and really detracts from the flavors."
"I had this on tap at Eli Cannon's. Appearence was a nice dark color with some ruby like hue. Medium tannish head. Typical smells for this dubbel, plums, grapes, sweet, and a light alcohol smell. Fruits and sweet mollasses attack your taste buds and leaves a slight warming alchohol character behind. Matches its scent very much. I'm a big belgian beer fan, I liked this, think its a solid, great tasting beer with good drinkability but it didn't suprise me as being anything too spectacular. All and all a good beer though."
"The Maredsous 8 had a beautiful golden amber color and a small light head. The lacing was very delicate and mild with the faintest hints of sweet fruits and yeast. The taste was outstanding, yeasty but not overpowering in terms of hoppiness or fruits. It finished dry and very tasty. I highly recommend this to anyone and everyone."
"Pours deep garnet in color with a very tall tan head that dissipates in chunks leaving a thick and rocky lace behind. Nose is a sweet brown sugar maltiness with some smoky and herbal aromas in the background. Taste begins with some fruity notes of plums and candied sugar followed by some biscuity and yeasty notes. Some estery and spicy alcohol rounds out the tasting. Even though the alcohol is noticeable, this is a fairly smooth beerI could drink a couple of these."
"Overall, very good. I'm enjoying this."
"Very nice to drink. Good to sit and mellow out with."
"The taste itself strongly reflects the malts, and there's a nice hoppy bitterness to the aftertaste (and I concur with other reviewers that it feels quite cleansing). Like the smell, there isn't nearly the fruity/citrusy/sweet taste that a lot of darks share... which really allows the malts to shine through, and this isn't a bad thing, although it does take away from the complexity of the taste. It's drinkability is great, with high carbonation, and a few of these can really hit the spot. Would definitely drink again."
"Notes: Nice to have tried it, wouldn't mind it again, but won't search it out."
"Drinkability: 8% Alc/Vol leaves the potential for ""multiple servings per sitting"". I was given one as a gift (with a set of three other belgians). If I was given a more, I would have indeed contined drinking these."
"Drinkability: Very strong and very heavy - slows you down and fills you up, and would thus not be appropriate as a session beer! One or two would be very nice on a cold night lke tonight though."
"I'd like to give this another go because it may have been past its prime, and I really enjoyed the Maredsous tripel, but for the moment I'd say there are plenty of other options in dubbels out there."
"Very nice brew, fairly complex, but not mind shattering. The right food would do wonders."
"Poured a dark brown colour with a slight head that disappeared relatively quickly. Mild sweet and fruity aroma. Rich full flavours with a rather sweet roasted finish. A relatively full bodied beer with good carbonation. I'd probably order it again, but I'll wait for cooler weather."
"Very drinkable - an excellent Dubbel."
"Not a session beer, but quite drinkable. Makes a nice night cap!"
"A good looking beer with a large cascading head and a bruised red color. The smells are mingeled full of malt and sweet plum notes. The first thing I noticed is the water like consistancy in my mouth. It has a decent taste of some malt complexities that don't hold my attetion. For the most part the beer for it mild complex flavor of dark dried fruit and malt is very thin and dry with a pleasent residual sweetness. Drinkable but too pricey."
"Taste is very dry for a Dubbel, sour note there also, quiet burnt and ending bitterburnt. Good beer but misses litle body in mouthfeel. Good carbonisation and taste make it up though and good drinkable."
"I may use this for cooking in the future, but it is not one of my favorite drinkers. Not to say it wasn't a great brew."
"I would rate drinkability very high on the beer because of it clean taste and mouthfeel. This is a beer I will seek out again."
"The body is big with a thick creamy mouthfeel and large bubbles of soft carbonation. A real treat to find an 8 % beer on tap in NC, Go!"
"i could polish off several of these."
"Drinkability: Excellent drink to finish a hike near the lake. Smooth, sweet, and refreshing."
"Drinkability: It is a good beer, but the one to have only once in a time. It is not the ""table"" beer, but a good entertainement beer."
"My first time to try this beer and believe it or not I had it on tap here in NC,pours a deep amber with a fluffy off white head leaving a nice amount of lace behind.Aromas of spiced cherry and brown suger with just a little yeasty spiciness going on as well,to me this beer tastes like fruit cake lightly spicy of cinnamon and some clove with a big fruitiness to go along like cherries and maybe some apricots.Well made I liked the 10 a little more but this will definently suffice and great to see in my neck of the woods on tap."
"Mouthfeel is very clean, and highly carbonated. This brew gains complexity as it warms. Fermented fruit morphs into a slightly tart tinge at first. This is coupled with a slight solvent feel from the alcohol which does it's job in aiding the various flavors. The alcohol feel is just enough to make the fruit flavors evident, but non-intrusive. Finishes out with an earthy oaky aftertaste. This is definitely a dubbel that is meant to be enjoyed sip by sip. Cheers."
"The body is fat and heavy, a warm, glowing mahogany, and clear. A faint cherry aroma remains mostly concealed by the head. I cant say as I really cared for this beer, as Im not a big fan of candi sugars. Ill allow that it might age well  the label said I had two more years to enjoy it  but the taste conveys a harsh peppery bite that just doesnt work for me."
"Pours a dark mahogany brown with an old fruit smell on the nose. The beer tastes old and in the way with lots of character in the midbody. The finish is semi- sweet with a fair amount of smoothness. This is a refined Dubbel that shows some interesting character,"
"Maredsous pours a thick hazelnut brown with a decent tan head. The smell is of caramel toffee with hints of grape and berry. The taste is of rich malts and sweet fruits, a bit of pepper and coreandor linger. Very nice. A medium bodied beer and great in any season, I found it went great with a nice prime rib."
"Pours a dark reddish brown color with a big foamy head that fell away quickly. Served a little too cold (my fault), so the aroma is weak, but the flavor is there. It's earthy, with caramel and spice, and I can really taste that alcohol too. Starts crisp with a lot of carbonation, and then the finish is sweet, with a slightly syrupy texture as it slips away. Not sure I want the whole 750 on my own, but it's open and maybe I'll be able to taste it better in 1/2 hour or so. Cheers."
"Personally, the alcohol got in the way of the other qualities. Nice copper color, average head and carbonation. Is not a session beer. Compared to the others choice in my flight, this was not one of my favorite, especailly for the style."
"Simply marvelous..."
" I like this beer it is entirely drinkable. It is relaxing and enjoyable. The 8% is evident after 2 bottles, my ears are red!!!"
"Served from a bottle into proper Maredsous glassware. Huge fluffy head, dark chocolate brown, darker than I expected. Aroma is slightly fruity, malty. Taste: Upfront it is slightly roasty, some chocolate and ripe fruits are present. Finish is crisp, somehwat effervescent. Mouthfeel is full, rich. A very good, drinkable dubbel, though there are better examples out there. I'd drink it again though if it was what was available."
"An interesting take on a Dubbel. This is more characteristic of a farmhouse ale than a Dubbel, but whatever it is, it's pretty good. It doesn't amaze me (it's a little too dry and earthy), and for the price, I'd pick other Dubbles over this (Allagash, New Belgium, St.Bernardus, Chimay). Still, it's an experience worth having."
"The beer pours a dark brown color with a thick frothy offwhite head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a nice malty scent that boasts of caramel and toasted malts along with a refreshing Belgian yeast aroma. The taste is good as well. It has a light, yet malty flavor that boasts of crystal and roasted malts. It goes down easy and finishes dry and fruity. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with good carbonation. This is an excellent dubbel. It has good malt character and a smooth finish; a good drinker."
"330 mL stubby, bottle conditioned, best before 12/2007 - served in a Chimay chalice. The body is a hazy dark brown with red shining through when held to the light. The 2 finger, tan head is creamy, huge, and rocky. All the bubbles are tiny and the head leaves clumps of foam on the glass. The aroma is weak - some malts, cloves, and yeast. Lots of sweet malts on the palate with cloves, alcohol, yeast, some spiciness, and hints of wine. Mouthfeel is smooth and it is very warming. Good, but the smell could be more pronounced."
"Pours a great-looking cloudy dark-ruby with enormous creamy tan head and endless lace. Smells of sweet candi sugars and bananas riding on a vinous alcohol base. Excellent and complex flavors. A burst of of tart and woody notes up front develop into spicy alcohol intermingled with ripe dark fruits in caramel and a touch of chocolate in the finish. Effervescent yet creamy smooth and very dry in the mouth. Quite yummy and drinkable, though relatively heady."
"Pours a dark ruby color, with a magnificent tan head that lingers. Smell is of dark fruit and malt, maybe a bit of bananas. Taste is of dark chocolate and brown sugar, very little hop flavor. The 8% alcohol makes its presence known towards the end of the taste, but quickly moves into a crisp, smooth finish that lingers pleasantly on the tongue. Mouthfeel is effervescent, with medium body. Drinkability is high, if you are into malt. This is a well-done belgian, I will have to try the 10."
"Taste is a quick downhill plummet. Fusel alcohol is heavyhanded all the way through. Prune juice and plum wine notes are the good news. Twangy yeast presents some chicken coop character that becomes dank and acrid. By the middle, phenolic notes take over, and metallic and plastic airplane glue notes take over. Not very pleasant. I could not finish this one. Acrid yeastiness, and fusel and phenolic to the extreme. Don't know what went wrong with this one, which began with such high promise."
"This is a nice example of a Dubel. It makes a nice beverage to warm you on a cloudy winter day."
"Pours a dark clear red, with a wonderful rippley tan head, one can tell this is the brewery that makes Duvel. Smell was spicy, with a touch of horse blanket and sourness. Taste was dark and smokey, with a spicy malt and some sourness and cherry notes creeping in as it warmed. This reminds me a lot of a Dubbel version of Duvel, I didn't like it at first, but it really grew on me. I am looking forward to trying to rest from this brewery."
"Got this one during Belgian Week at the Moan and Dove. Pours a very dark yet somehow clear looking brownish red. More brown than red I guess. Smells Fruity and a bit grapey almost. Juicy and somewhat buttery and dusty. Taste is definately complex. Fruits and wine hints with a decent amount of sweet malts backing it up. Hops are pretty hidden in this beer but there is a nice bitterness to it. Alcohol is a little too present. Kind of thin in the mouthfeel but overall a really interesting beer."
"Really great mouthfeel, great drinkability, just a little weak in the taste though. To bad :)"
"Once again, thanks Rich. Its marvelous. Supposedly it is best before September (or april - you never know with these date things), but its terrific now."
"This beer came after two in a row that I had to pour, so it didn't have much to overcome. Nice surprise. Pours a copper color with moderate head and leaves a little bit of lacing on the glass. The aroma is slightly spicy with caramel, banana, and clove. Nice. The flavor was some slight caramel and banana, but very subdued. The flavor didn't have any 'punch' that I expected. Very plain. Not bad, but just kind of there."
"The head pours 4 fingers over the 2 fingers of beer. The beer smells divine after the last two that I've had. There is a sweet caramel covered banana with nice spicey tones in the background. Amen. Not as bad as the last two. The flavor is actually somewhat plain. I get hints of banana, some burnt caramel and a spicey note from the yeasties. Nice beer. The feel is moderate, with some creamies. I like it. Drinkability is nice on this one as well. I find it smooth and very pleasing. Good beer."
"Drinkability is smooth with the same slightly spicy caramel after taste that gives this a crisp finish."
"Beer is good. Happy beering."
"This was from a 750ml bottle. It poured a deep brown to mahogany color. Very cloudy/hazy with a thick tan head. The drink left a thick sheen of the tan head as a lace. The aroma is malty richness with hints of sweet fruit like cherries, figs and blackberries. The taste has a brief tartness mixed with the malt sweetness. This would have a heavy mouth feel if the alcohol did not cut it. Instead it has a creamy and slick character. Pretty well balanced as the hops do come through towards the end of the drink. Not my favorite dubbel, as I think the alcohol is to forward, but still a fine representation of the style."
" This brew had a taste of the bottle cap which ruined it for me, too bad."
"The smell contains some hints of coffee, caramel and dark fruits. Almost stout-like. Taste is very complex, with mostly the same elements of the smell: sweet with dark fruits, chocolate and burned sugar. The carbonation and mouthfeel are good and the 8° Alc. is well hidden indeed. A very tasty beer and one of the best dubbels I've had so far. Highly recommended!"
"Stright 4's across the board. Had this beer on tap at the Toronado in September, 2004. Poured with a huge haed as the barkeep had to dump the top of the beer several times. Smells of dark fruits. Almost candied fruits. Maybe like grandma's fruitvake. I sensed cherries, plums, maybe even prunes? The lace just stayed forever within the sides of my glass. Finished with a kind of coffee or dark chocolate kind of taste. Hazelnut?? Maybe espresso? Something a bit different. A sweet beer, but easy to drink. A very good beer. 8%??? Didn't have a clue. Felt like about 5% at the time. But, I feel it now after two of them."
"Very boozy aroma and taste with some dark beer behind it. Like hard liquor. Can I have a vodka instead with some root beer? Some nut and chocolate taste. Some hops. But not some more. Aggressive plum, dark malts there. Its drinkable, but before you call it a night."
"All in all, not a pretty good beer, but I'm not sure it's worth the $2+ I spent for it..."
"Pours a clear, deep amber-ruby color. It is topped by a mid-sized creamy light brown head. The aroma is redolent of dark fruity notes of raising, fig, and plum. It also has aromatic notes of brown sugar, and rum, it almost smells like a rich fruitcake. It is lightly sweet up front, which turns into a rich fruity maltiness, and finishes with a bit of yeast driven spiciness. As it warms up a bit the fruity notes of plum and raisin are joined by notes evocative of apple cider. Has a certain lightness to it, despite it's rich flavors, and is quite effervescently carbonated as well. This beer is actually fairly dry, despite my first impressions. The nose is a bit richer, and a tad more enjoyable than the taste."
"I really enjoyed this one. It's unfortunate that I've yet to find it anywhere closer, but it would be worth the occasional trip back. Unfortunately, it was the only beer on-tap that wasn't $2.50 on $2.50 draft night."
"Overall this is a good dubbel, one of the better one's that I have had, and would certainly try it again."
"Pours jet black in my goblet. Huge amounts of head, tan and foamy, it lasts and lasts and lasts. Smell is of alcohol and faint raisins. Taste is not as good as other belgians I've had. Flavor is pretty one note, I expected a little more from the makers of duvel. Oh well, It''s still a good beer, but it leaves much tto be desired."
"drinkability: very high, this was delicious! I'd never heard of this or tried it before, and I was quite impressed, it's like they mixed a great Belgian with a chocolate Stout, I will have this again!"
"Haven't really had a Maredsuous beer that i've disliked. This had a lot going for it. Chocolatey/caramelly, and reallly subtle and soft. Like an English mild, with a Belgian twist and 8%ABV!!! Subtle and delicious. Nothing wrong with this, faultless. I actually could drink a lot of these, everything seemed to be in the right place, strong, yet absolutely subtle, lightly spicy."
"Deep burgundy on the pour with an egg white head that rises and falls quickly. Thick sheet above the liquid, tons of lacing along my glass. Smell is strong and fruity sweet. Taste begins with vinous flavors of red grapes, plums, figs; they are very sweet yet complex in their own right. I detect a caramel sweetness as well. Yeast and alcohol lure in the background initially. Chocolate is down there even deeper. A spicyness comes through along with a slight hop flavor. The finish is where the yeast and alcohol really come through. Very dry finish. Lots of complexity here, this is a really engaging beer. I feel as if I could drink many of these in one sitting if not for the alcoholic strength. I had two, one refrigerated, one at near room temp. I would for sure go with drinking this beer at room temp."
"A great beer that is full of flavor and easy to drink. I love it."
"Had this on tap at Eulogy in philly. Dark chocolate brown with a nice, thick, creamy, khaki head atop. Scents of rootbeer... hard to catch much else- problem with this wonderful tavern is that late on a Saturday afternoon, you get alot of smoke that hinders the senses a bit... Tastes of dark fruits, mainly dark cherries or candied cherries maybe? Slight bit of darkened toast in the background. Bit of chocolate. Can taste the alcohol more as it warms up. Medium carbination, maybe a bit too much? Seems too much for the style for me... probably would have thought more of the mouthfeel if there was a tad less carb here... Served at the perfect temperature and in the perfect glass, just a great, happy experience here! Pretty damn good though."
"Pours a clear ruby, copper color with a pillowy beige head that lasts. Pour with patience. Malty, candi sugary, almost perfumy aroma; indeed a noble dubbel. There's some hops in there, too, kind of subdued under all the malt and yeast profile. Nutty malt taste and cereal, with complex malt derivatives flowing into a fruitrd finish. Yeastiness and complete fermentation suggest further perfuminess amongst the malt. A rather unique dubbel, and worth a try. I like it best out of the 75 cL, but not bad on-tap, too."
"The great promise of the appearance and aroma didn't hold in the flavor and feel. To me there was a significant lack of complexity. Certainly entertaining enough to try, sample and have again. Just not great like its sibling, Duvel."
"This dubbel poured a clear, dark garnet color with tan foam that settled but clung to the glass. The smell was a nice malty and dried fruit aroma. The taste was malty and fruity (dried fruit: raisins, prunes, etc.) with notes of caramel and cocoa. The mouthfeel was very smooth and creamy with a light, airy feeling. There was a lightly lingering malty taste. The body was medium with low carbonation feel. This was a very pleasant dubbel."
"Flavor is devine! A burst of sweetness to begin that grows in fruit character culminating in a tangy finish that leaves you wanting more. Excellent."
"The taste is very complex, and there were lots of flavours that tried to draw my attention. They worked fine together, but I found it just too much, it was more like drinking aged red wine than beer. Maredsous 8 is unquestionable a fine craft beer, but it is simply not one for me."
"Brewed in the dubbel style by the brewers of Duvel, the Maredsous 8 is sure to please. It's clear, dark ruby brown body offsets a full, creamy head of ivory foam that seems intent on holding until the last; and it's lacing is second to none (except of course, it's sisters the Maredsous 10 and Duvel). The aroma is straightforward dubbel with a well-balanced combination of It's delicately crisp across the palate with a very fine effervescence and medium body. The flavor expresses more chocolate and caramel notes hidden behind its candyish sweetness than the nose lets on, backed by a drying spiciness and a touch of fruitiness. It finishes dry with a lingering note of spiciness. Exceptionally well done and quite enjoyable! Certainly worth trying."
"Very drinkable, I had the Maredsous 10, it was OK, but this is far more refined in flavor. PERFECT for any smoked foods or a grilled steak, or Barbecue."
"Poured out a dark brown/garnet color with a big head that took forever to settle down. But when it did a nice dubbel sat before me. Smell consisted of lots of fruits and earthy tones that blended well together actually. Taste was very good. Lots going on in the taste department. Dark fruit, some cloves and spiciness mixed in. Some hops show their muscles as well in the middle but die down quickly. Finished very dry which made you want more and more of this brew. Quite a dubbel, seek it out."
"Drinkability: Definitely a beer for pairing with food, or possibly as an after dinner digestif. Could also pass as an afternoon restorative. Hell, I'd drink it for breakfast."
"Poured a Coca-Cola brown, with ruby highlights at the edge of the glass when held against the light. A dense, two-finger head stayed with the beer all the way down. Aroma was fairly neutral, but there was a hint of chocolate malt, which for some reason struck me as a bit odd for the style. On the first sip, I was almost shocked by an initial perception of a mineral flavor that bordered on salty. This quickly diminished and was not evident through the rest of the beer, although it did remain rather dry. The fruit flavors common for the style did not really emerge, and I think I may have been drinking this beer a bit young."
"Pours a deep cloudy brown with a huge 2 finger tan head that has excellent retention and leaves patches of lace. Aroma is a mix of malt, chocolate, dark fruits and a touch of orange. Flavor began with chocolate and orange peel notes... not overly sweet, with some light fig presence and a slightly sour finish. Could have maybe used a touch more complexity, but it's light body and smooth mouthfeel make this a very drinkbale beer. The high ABV is very well hidden."
"I wanted a whole lot more ""umph"" from this beer, but got a thin, simple brune instead. Lacks character."
"Medium bodied and well carbonated for the impression of a crisp mouthfeel. There doesn't seem to be much *there* to the flavor profile at first, but it gets significantly better as the beer warms. In the end, I'm actually rather fond of it -- not the best dark Belgian ale I've had (and I'd actually classify this as a *strong* dark Belgian ale, given its 8% ABV). But not at all bad, either. Yum."
"Heavy feeling on the tongue especially with the latent alcohol burn. Not a ""chewy"" beer but very nice flavors and I liked the afterburn, nice warming feeling. I'll have this again."
"Bottle  Poured a rubbish brew with a huge head with lasting retention. I very much enjoyed the aroma of roastiness and of spice. Body is quite strong with some good carbonation. Taste is very good with an almost perfect match of spice and malts. I am still very impressed by the way those Belgian beer can include such a high level of ABV in such a subtle way. To me, this is as good as Chimay Bleu."
"This strong brown ale (dubbel) pours with a fluffy head that falls fairly quickly leaving little ""clouds"" of foam and nice lace along the sides of my LaTrappe glass. It has a very intriguing lighlty musty aroma laced with dark fruits such as plums. This beer has a very soft mouthfeel and a fairly light body with a hint of dark rum-like flavors accented with sugary caramel bits. There's a dash of bitterness in the finish, which is dry, but over fairly quickly. Could be a little more complex. A rather quaffable Belgian beer until its strength catches up with you."
"Worth savouring, nicely done."
"So's the taste. Rich body, fruit notes all over yith a slight carbonation sneaking in between to compliment it in a very pleasant way. The rich body doesnt impede having quite a few though. Very nice brew."
"Only distraction from what I view as a pretty tasty beer and treu to Dubbel style"
"This is an absolutely drinkable beer that seems very versatile. I could drink this beer anytime of the year--as a winter warmer, a greeter of spring, a nice summer patio beer, or an autumnal reveler."
"A brown pour with a smallish tan head. The nose has a nice range of aromas from chocolate to molasses down to earthy & spicey notes. There is also a bready quality in there as well. The mouthfeel is fairly lively and full with plenty of bubbliness. The taste starts dull and earthy and then heads towards a sweeter medium body. Highlighted by chocolate and spice the beer bends toward a dry finish with a nice alcohol warmth. A pleasant drinking experience."
"Drinkability: A nice room temp sipper."
"sampled in a duvel glass. color was deep burgundy/ brown with a creamy tan-white head. aromas of caramel and candy sugar. very complex taste with a nutty, malty sweetness. also hints of plum and a little toastyness. slightly bitter in the finish. the carbonation reminded me of duvel- overall a nice, complex brew a bit too much for a session, but a nice one-off."
"After reading other reviews, and letting the beer warm a bit, I’m starting to appreciate it more, but I’m thinking I’m robbing the cradle a bit with this sample. Maybe I will buy a couple stubbys and let them take up some cellar space for a year or two."
"Recommended, and not bad value at less than $7 for 750ml either!!"
"I liked this beer much better at the end of the glass than I did at the beginning, and that's unusual for me. By the time I took my last swallow I'd grown to admire the way its carbonated caramel sweetness quickly flipped over into a lambic-like cherry finish, and I was looking forward to my next glass."
"I find no evidence of alcohol within this taste. Nicely done but nothing special either."
"Light head that disappears quickly, but it did lace the glass. Looks like a hint of red in the dark brown color. Really doesn't smell much like anything, but tastes fantastic. Dubbels are my favorite style of beer and this one doesn't disappoint. All kinds of flavors mingle in your mouth after a sip. Tiny bubbles make it go down smooth. Very nice beer overall. I wish I had another bottle."
"Having this on tap was a treat. The beer arrived in the Maredsous glass, sporting a nice dark brown color with a nice off-white head. The head lasted through the drink, and also formed a nice lacework on the glass. The aroma was sweet. The taste was very sweet roasted malt with barely noticeable bite of bitterness; possibly some caramel tones.Very enjoyable for a slow drink, as a light alcohol level is noticable and for its overall sweetness."
"Overall Impression: Another great one from Duvel-Moortgat. Their line of abbey ales is really spot on. Good stuff!"
"This is a special beer. Served at the Eulogy bar. This one is just about perfect in every way. I can find no faults and would not change a thing. First of all the beer was served in its own special goblet and had a wonderful deep copper brown color. Perfect appearance with a superb clarity and was topped off with a rich creamy head. The aroma was strong in caramel and roasted malts. A very buttery and smooth body with a rich mouthfeel. Slightly sticky and candy sweet. Flavors that come through are complex, but not too intense. Molasses, brown sugar, caramel along with a hidden spiciness. Alcohol is barely noticeable. If I had to choose only one desert island beer, this would be near the top of the list. Outstanding."
"A thicker than normal mouthfeel for a dubbel, too, something I really like. This beer won me over a long time ago in bottle form, great to see that its excellent on tap and available. Have it at cellar temperature. Best dubbel I’ve ever had, pure opinion - many won’t agree. (Opinion may change once my trappists are done cellaring for two years)"
"This brew pours a large head of creamy light brown finely sized bubbles that left an excellent lacing with a semi transparent dark ruby red brwon body. Its aroma was very nice and sweet with roasted caramle and malt notes. Initially its flavor come off as alcohol and its mouthfeel is very thick but then it smoothens in its finish with a nicer malty mildy spicey bready flavor that become very smooth."
"Drinkability: this beer is way too drinkable for the % ABV! Dangerously drinkable. Delicious, complex taste and smoothness make for a wonderful experience and one I'd definitely come back to."
"Came out a beautiful reddish brown hue under a firm tan head that stayed with me right to the end, leaving rings (not sheets) of lace all the way to the bottom. The nose was sweet and fruity, with the typical francophone twang but much more pleasant than, for example, Leffe. The mouth was sweet and fruity with only a light carbonation. The taste starts off malty, but quickly moves to cherry sweet, followed by bitter chocolate. Lots of stuff going on here. The aftertaste settles down to cherry and mild flowery hop. This is definitely a beer to be respected."
"Had a sweet, fruity smell. Taste was fruity and sweet I thought there were elements of banana in the flavor. Rather potent at 8% abv, so I declined a second pint, although I did enjoy it."
"557"
"Pours with a thick off-white head that stays, leaving a ton of lace. Not much carbonation. Brownish ruby color, medium bodied, starts as a sweet mix of malt with a bit of hop, finishes sweet and crisp. Nose is a complex fruit and toffee - nice. Very smooth, but one to mellow - the high ABV is not really noticeable - be careful with this dubbel."
"-F"
"Well, this beer flows out of the tap with a deep amber brown tint complemented by a tan white full head sitting in my goblet. Aroma has wine-like qualities, very sweet not picking up any real hop aroma here. The flavor can only be described as Swedish fish, yes the candy, this beer tastes exaclty like those little red buggers infused with a strong alcoholic finish soaked in wine. Full fermented grape aftertaste, has an alright drinkability. This beer goes down way too easy for being 8 percent abv and this beer is medium to light in texture."
"On Tap: Thanks to Feloniousmonk! Served in a tall goblet/wine glass. Color was a dark brownish red like mahogeny or dark maple syrup with a small tan head that left some lacing around the edges. Smell is faintly subtle but complex with some toffee candy, fruit, and caramel malt. Taste is complex in levels, starts out with malty sweetness with a little spice, the middle is fruity with a full, rounded body thast very soothing and smooth, the finish is slightly bitter smooth with a little spice and there is a warming dry alcohol that feels like a wetter styled wine. The feel is so smooth and silky with a light syrupy kind of hold thats charmingly subtle and clean with that nice wine-like alcohol finish. This felt and tasted like what I think would be a liquid toffee candy with a bit of sweet spice. This was super drinkable and enjoyable around such good company, ie., the BA boys."
"Very nice and smooth all the way down. It had a pretty full body to it and the flavor was all there. Lots of fruits thrown in there. I got a lot of cherry and raspberry flavors as well as a big malt presence. It was much different than I had expected. A unique brew that is certainly enjoyable. Carbonation is light, but it is still enough to tingle a bit. It is also a good one to sit and drink. I don't think you'll be taking down 8 of these, but it is very drinkable."
"Beautiful garnet in color. Clear and carbonated. A healthy beige head sits on top and has some staying power. The beer laces in sheets. Some musty, herbal and smoked jerk tones on the nose. Pretty subdued though. The flavors are subtle as well. Some fruity esters. Some alcohol, but not much. Some biscuit and bread tones. A little yeastiness. It all adds up to a pretty average flavor to me. It's airy in the mouth and about medium in body (at best). One I won't seek out, but wouldn't turn down if offered to me."
"Mouthfeel was thick and full, and somewhat slick...this is a full bodied beer. Flavors of plums, cherries, chocolate, and clove are quite prevalent, and I thought the 8% tag was well hidden in the flavor, but certainly not in actuality."
"The smell is apples, candy, some Belgian spiciness, some grains. Hints of chocolate might be my imagination, but I don't think so. The beer starts butter-caramely, spicy, sweet. Again, hints of chocolate. The middle is sour and fruity with a full body. Some nice butter and burnt caramel. The finish is dry with pepper and bread and there is pronounced alcohol. It's nice. Not my favorite, for sure, but good. The caramel is almost too charred and the alcohol is a little too obvious."
"And a note of warning: Vesuvius hasn't gone off since the second world war, and it's usually a very regular mountain. Naples is 3 million people and closer than Pompeii was. If the wind's going the other way there's going to be trouble."
"Murky dark reddish brown, huge tan head and spectacular rich lace effects. Dark Mexican chocolate malty aromas, some molasses, and it carries far. Slight orangish smell as well. Flavors of unsweetened chocolate, raisins, and spicy cinnamon echo the aromas. Fruit undertones of cherry and mild citrus. Rich and satifying at first, body thins close to the finish with some coffee in the aftertaste. Creamy and smooth, most of the looks of Duvel without the tart astringency."
"To give this beer the benefit of the doubt, I'll rate it as a combo of tonight's bottle and my memories of it from years' past. I can't recall the smoked phenols from the past, the green apple flavors and the slightly thin, sour finish brought me back to a time when I remembered that I didn't like Maredsous very much... The epitome of a totally unexciting Belgian Dubbel"
"Caged and corked, it was served from a 750 ml. bottle with a retro, Jazz Age label with red triangles, squares, and a rectangle set against a black background. The cork appears to indicate that it was bottled in October 2001. Although the month and day on the ""best before"" label are legible, the year is difficult to make out; it could be 2003, 2006, or 2008. The color is a very nice reddish-brown with a foamy head that disappeared almost completely. Notes of sweet fruit, including banana, are present in the smell, along with a distinct spiciness. With all of those flavors present, the beer is surprisingly dry and it all evaporates almost immediately, leaving a bit of tangy aftertaste that is slightly off-putting. The mouthfeel is slightly on the thin side compared to most dubbels."
"Pours a clear brown/amber with a massive cream-colored head that is more like meringue in texture. The smell of sweet fruit and light spices with a hint of yeast in the background makes your mouth water. The flavor of fruit and raisons with a light bitter hop and it finishes with a citrusy dry and bitter end. This is a very complex brew with a wave of flavors taking you on a trip through most spectrums of the tongues senses. It made for a nice experience!"
"This beer poured a reddish brown with little foam and no lace. The smell was of roasted malts and a fruity aroma. The first dip brought again the roasted malts, fruits and a hint a caramel on the first sip. It also had a soft, sweet maltiness, rich and effervescent. A well balanced sweet/bitter feel in the mouth and after taste."
"Served on tap with a nice thick, creamy foam. Had a dark caramel color with little in the way of smell. Packs a good kick with a bit of unpleasant aftertaste. Overall, an OK beer. Too bitter for my taste to really want again but would recommend if you like strong bitter beer."
"I'd only heard of this a month ago, and just today put it on tap in my bar, replacing Budweiser! It's my first taste, and it's up at the top of my list already!"
"Pours a deep ruby red, with a pertinent sized beige head, adequate lace, and both degenerate quickly, leaving clumps to coat the glass. Malt nose, somewhat sweet, banana tones also noted, still clean and fresh. Start sweet, middle medium, potently carbonated, pleasant hop spicy bite, and a dry aftertaste, which lingers on. This beer is much more to my liking than the 6 and a tad better in all aspects, good but not great and I still think the whole line is worth a sample, for The Belgiephiles in the audience."
"I gave this beer a good score because I didn't want to piss it off."
"What a beer.  This beer is proof that beer has as much variety as wine, probably more.  Unbelievable!  I had this on tap at Croxley's Ales in Long Island.  So fresh, as soon as he poured it, I could smell it as he brought it over.  Meduim darkness paired with a rich, creamy head that never dissipated.  Aromas of rasins and plums waft into your nose.  Also on the taste, you could sense all the fruit.  More ripe plums and rasins, combined with a slight toasted malt flavor.  Very rich, warming  and alcoholic.  It reminded me of rich port.  This is a brew to really sit and sip after dinner or any memorable occasion."
"Deep, dark brown color. Thick foamy head, stayed for-ever, and laced down the glass nicely. Rich roasted malt and yeasty aromas. Taste was complex, lots of roasted fruity smells of plums, bananas, with a touch of spicy sweetness. Finish was subtle and lingered slightly, reminded me of a port wine taste. Slightly bubbly feel. No more than one at a time. I had this with triscuits and felt like a yuppie."
"Notes: Complex is not saying enough, so many levels of flavours that go around it is nearly too much. This brew is to be sipped and savoured and should be consumed at cellar temperature for optimum flavour. This is one Dubbel that does not take any crap."
"Another delicious dark strong ale from Belgium. It's a satisfying blend of sweet roasted malt, plum, raisin, nutmeg that's extremely smooth. A slight alcohol warming takes effect and makes this a pleasure to sip and enjoy."
