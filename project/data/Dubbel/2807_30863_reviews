"O: This is an amazing beer! Highly recommend it. It easily competes with the greats and  IMO beats out Chimay and Maudite. Even though it's a bit strong to be a Dubbel, it makes for a fantastic dark strong. This is good stuff!"

"Hazy ruby-accented dark russet brown body beneath a frothy head of light tan. A bit of zesty carbonation is common for the style so that makes sense, and the quick rising bubbles help to bolster the head, giving it great head retention. The aroma displays dark skinned fruits and spiciness with a little bit of brown sugar and caramel thrown in to round it out, and the flavor follows suit, simply adding a touch of grassy (and perhaps spicy...?) hops to the background. The fermentation seems clean, other than producing the brilliant dark fruitiness and (some) spice; and it's well-balanced by a moderate to median bitterness (it's kind of hard to tell with the carbonic bite of the CO2). Not a lot of brewers are producing this style of beer right now, and certainly not to this quality. This is also a very fresh bottle, and I think that a few months of aging might soften it and open it up a bit to reveal a greater depth of maltiness. Impressive. I'm going to have to seek out more offerings from this brewery."

"This is a very good beer, very similar to Unibroue’s Le Terrible, just slightly rougher. It looks good, smells great, and is very flavorful."

"overall - not impressed, for $4 a pint. will not buy again."
"Poured into tulip glass. A medium brown in color with plenty of reddish tint. Slight head, left a ring around the collar, light brown in color. Aroma was very fruity, a bit like a fig or plum, maybe a hint of grapes, small note of pepper. Taste was slighty malty, then shifted to a bit of sugary sweet with some fruit notes as well. Strange mouthfeel, no real coat, almost left the mouth dry. Not bad, but seemed drier than I would expect."
"O - Not my favourite style, but very good beer, the brewer does not disappoint."

"Dark brown pour, toasted oat colored head that disappeared to a thin line. Ripe fig smell with some caramel, browned butter, raisin, black cherry soda. Wonderful carbonation - very clean tasting. The flavors have mellowed a bit, and everything is slightly muted, flavor wise: rum raisins, dark brown sugar, vanilla bean. There a bit of boozyness to the aftertaste, and just the right amount of sour, like overripe bananas. I'd gladly search this one out again."

"A nice enjoyable take on a dubbel. Only downside seems to be aging. I've tried two with just over a year of age, this particular brew seem better fresh."

"O: Very clean interpretation. For dubbel drinkers this a must try. Well-put together, pronounced flavors, complex yet easy to drink. Water/yeast characteristics similar to a Unibroue product."
""
"Good beer. It is unified and neither overly nor underly complex. A lot going on but nothing to distract. A little sweet for my taste but the welcome balancing presence of the hops does wonders. Probably won't become a staple or anything but I could have a couple without getting burnt out on it. Would drink again."

"Overall, the smell was surprisingly quiet. But this was exceptionally balanced and, I felt, pushed to the limits. If this beer had more spice, if it had more malt, more sweetness, more carbonation, more of anything! It would have felt overdone. But this was great. This was really great. Kind of a dream dubbel for me. I've had dubbels from Belgium and Trappists that have nothing on this. A great interpretation to the style. I will be getting this again in the future without even a second thought."

"O - One of the niced dubbels I've ever had."
""
"Overall: This would rate much higher if it wasn't for the carbonation issues. Glad it's local so i can keep trying."
"Overall: A decent Dubbel, but too conservative in my eyes. Severly low in depth, it's more protuberant quality is the alcohol play. The carbonation, ABV and residual sugar ratio proves effective and very enjoyable in allowing for a smooth buzz, that pervades without much notice."

"Was quite impressed with this example, seems to stack up with some of the better examples of the style. The balance and complexity of this are solid and it makes a very drinkable and interesting beer. Worth seeking out."
"Review from 11/2010 notes. Poured into a Nostradamus flute glass. Pours a semi opaque, somewhat muddy red-orange amber. Thick, aggressive head (foamed out of the bottle), leaving light lacing; lasts a long time. Sweet caramel malt and very spicy aroma. Taste is sweet malts, raisins, dark fruit, brown sugar, cloves, cinnamon, complex. Middle and finish are lighter versions of the start, almost seems a slight let down that there is not a burst of flavor at the end. Still a complex, but subtle flavoring. Quite different. I would like to try other ales from this brewery."

"Good beer. Poured at a good temperature with a smallish, foamy, tan head that soon settles to a self-replenishing island and ring and no lace. Color is a hazy/cloudy amber copper with some tiny bubble trails. Aroma is malt, fruit, spice. Flavor is like nose plus sweet up front, followed by carbonic tang, little bitterness. Body is full and round and has the right carbonation to cut the sweetness. Finish is like flavor, average length, and boozy."
"O - a good beer to pick up and give a try, you might like it a lot"
""
"Drinkability: It's a very smooth drinkable beer accompanied with great flavors and aromas."
"Overall: a very smooth, easy drinking double with a rich, complex, not-too-sweetness that would go great with dessert"
""
"Not a beer style I personally choose very often, but I am glad to have tried this particular one."
""
""
"Overall – Another quality beer from this brewer. The alcohol is well hidden and the beer is very drinkable. It's got the perfect amount of sweetness that leaves it flavourful but not cloying. Not sure I'd pick it up again, but I'm glad I gave it a shot."
""
""
"M - Medium body with a nice chew. Light to moderate carbonation."
""
"Overall, once this warmed up a bit I was quite impressed with it. I think a smaller bottle size would be best, however as the dryness did add up a little, but aside from that, I think this is the dubbel I'd choose from this point on."
"An excellent dubbel that is a must buy when it comes around"
""
"D - A great dubbel with a different tasting flavor. While this wasn't exactly what I expected, it's still a great beer. And as with any good tasting beer with a high ABV, the alcohol sneaks up quickly. I like it, but a 500ml bottle is enough for me."
""

"O: Very nice. Not the most complex or outstanding dubbel I've tried but overall a very solid entry. I'd happily drink another if I had one."
"Browninsh ruby colour, one finger of off white/tan head, good lacing left on the glass. Smell is of dark sugars and dark fruits, raisin, figs, black liquorice, mild yeasty presence, slight alc. Taste is of dark fruit with sopme candy notes, brown sugar, raisin, jammy dark fruit in the finish with some herbal notes, black liquorice is pretty present throughout. Medium carbonation, soft feel, delicate and creamy, med-full body. Not bad but this failed to ""wow"" me like some of the other stuff from these guys, quite drinkable but a little put off by the herbal flavours after a while."
"Fairly good for a dubble, I found the malt profile a touch darker than my favorites of the style. Also, I found that the star anise flavor was a bit unwelcome for me, but that's a personal preference. All-in-all, complex and interesting. Solid Dubbel."
""
"Overall, a solid beer and fair representation of the style. Wish I had one to age for 18 months or so. I'd be interested to see how this ages."
"O - There is no doubt this dubble is a good choice! I would drink it again! However, the caramelized notes in addition to the very syrupy taste affect the drinkability of this beer. To me, these are the major downfalls. I might try having it colder next time."
" Lots of dark fruit like esters were bouncing around with it as well, but there was just this tremendously big earth, malt aroma coming off. Some raisins and figs were playing around in there as well. Lots of spiced rum like flavors coming at me at first, then the malted bread like tones sitting in behind it. A very thick flavor, I was not expecting it to be this big. Lots of raisins, figs, plums, and a touch of apricot playing around in there letting you know the yeast was doing its thing. As I let it sit, and started to take bigger sips it got a little bit lighter for me, but still retained its very nice profile. Nice dry finish"
"O- It's a very good beer, but not a great beer. Really easy beer for 8.5%, Charlevoix still remains one of Canada's best!"
"Pleasant spiced Belgian ale—I find it hard to really consider it a dubbel, a style with which it shares few characteristics, but it has the body of a Belgian and the light drinkability. It is odd, though."
"Overall, a decent but not great dubbel. Enjoyable but a long way of, say, a Westmalle or an Ommegang."
"D: Overall, a very solid Dubbel."
"A fine dubbel with a nice spicy sweet taste, certainly worthy of recommendation. I could certainly drink a lot of this over the course of the evening, though the ABV is probably going to prevent that. Not the greatest dubbel I've had, but certainly an enjoyable one."
"D: Quite a different take on the style - if that. Not a bad beer, but I wouldn't get it again. Nothing to special."
"Overall feel is pretty smooth and moist. Slight dark fruit aftertaste. This is quite easy to drink. Not quite as good as some dubbels I have had, but still a solid beer."
"Pours a deep red/mahogany with a few fingers of creamy tan head. Sweet nose, hints of green apple, but some syrupy dark fruits too. Fresh, with a sense of acidity, but at the same time I'm smelling something that reminds me of banana walnut cake. Intriguing. Taste is walnuts, more allspice, light and tart green apple and some dark fruits to a lesser extent. Overall, beer is sweet with a good tart balance. Smooth, creamy and warming (and somewhat spicy) mouthfeel, alcohol is masked. Medium carbonation and a sipper for the most part. Alot to digest with this one, but another nice effort from Charlevoix."
"Dominus Vobiscum Double strongly reminds me of one of my favourite Belgian ales: Rochefort 8. To even mention its name in the same class is a complement most flattering to its brewer. While I can imagine the strong notes of clove and anise might overpower some, I'm sure most people would agree that this is a rather voluptuous, sensual offering."
"Dominus Vobiscum (Latin for ""The Lord be with you"") Double could be a very good spiced Belgian-style dubbel. Too bad I'll probably never find out for sure. Especially since this sort of beer, if done right, is usually right up my Belgian ale lovin' alley."
"D - Can't say I'd like more than one of these. Decent, but not the best example of the style I've had by a long shot. Somewhat heavy as well."
"Explodes with a five+ finger light tan head that fades quickly leaving traces of lace. Cloudy deep mahogany color. Good carbonation and medium bodied. Dark fruit nose. Flavor is dark fruit, cloves with a dry fruit finish. High ABV is hidden. $7.99 for a 500ml bottle from Beverage Warehouse Winooski, VT."
"D - very complex flavours with a very strong feel, i don't really think the strong carbonation goes with these flavours but it works well enough, the strong alcohol is well hidden, you'll be glad you tried this"
"Nice to see this some of the offerings from this brewery in the Atlanta area. It's imported by Shelton Brothers, so it should see widespread (if spotty) representation. Pours a slightly cloudy chestnut with a nice head that sticks around as a cap. Lots of spice and vanilla in the nose- quite sweet, and quite creamy. The star anise is very noticeable. The taste is still fairly sweet, but not nearly so much as the nose suggests it will be. Nice creamy malt notes, some Belgian yeast tang, a fairly big hit of star anise, and dried dark fruit. Quite tasty, and probably better as a digestif. Nice."
"D- At 9% this is a one bottle per night beer but really excellent. I would definitely get this again."
"The finish was smooth, clean and warming leaving me wanting more... much more! This was excellent. I was enjoying it with some friends and I could not stop talking about how perfect it was. I don't think that Microbrasserie Charlevoix's beers are available outside of Quebec, so if you are ever there make sure you find some! I have their Triple waiting for me in the fridge."
"*M + D: Not quite as 'sparkling' as some, but a very assertive carbonation. It helps the retention of the head, as well. Decent sipper...some alcohol warmth peeks through."
"Pours a ruby-brown colour with huge head. Great lacing and head retention. Smell is of dark malt and licorice. Quite spicy too, I suppose this is the anise. This tastes almost like a winter warmer mixed with a dubbel. It is quite interesting. Great carbonation level."
"Overall this was a good beer but I have to think that it could benefit a bit if the anise notes were toned down. Still, a solid effort and worth a shot to see for yourself."
"D - As you might have guessed, not my cup of tea."
"D: An excellent, drinkable beer."
"Very nice example from a brewery I've never heard of until now. Glad to see more Quebec microbreweries getting distribution in Vermont, seeing how close both places are."
"This is really good. There are lots of complexities that makes for a very enjoyable and unique Dubbel. Something I would highly recommend."
"Don't notice the black licorice as much. Much better head retention and general look."
"This is a serious beer. Back when I was first getting into beers, I bought Charlevoix's Triple thinking that since it was one more than Double it must be better. Was that ever stupid. I realized recently that I didn't ever go back to try the Double. This is by far the best of the 500ml Dominus Vobiscum releases. I'm kicking myself for not having tried this a long time ago. This is one of the top regularly-bottled beers in the country and one of my new favorites."
"DrinkAbility: this is a sipper, taste last long a lot of diffentent taste, high alcool level make this brew very interesting for a nice winter drink"
"This is the second beer from Charlevoix I've tried and I'm thinking I need too try more of what they offer. These just came too Alberta and I'm better off because of it, can't wait for more of these beers to hit the shelves out west"
"I'm slowly ploughing my way through the Charlevoix lineup and its been a great experience so far. They seem to be a consistently strong brewery, and some of the beers have a wonderfully fragrant flavour."
"Along with the Blanche, I think this is one of their better beers. A spicier, citrus twist on a traditional dubbel that works wonderfully. Thanks Rob!"
"All things considered this is a pretty drinkable 8.5% ABV beer."
"One bottle a night would be about as much as you could handle but it is definitely one to buy more of."
"I had to let this one settle in the glass and warm up to see where they were going with the style. It is really a spiced belgian dubbel that almost tastes like Xmas ale ( think Unibroue 17). Not the most complex beer it also suffers from a little too much sweetness ( cellaring may be a good idea). The beer benefits from the spices as without it would be an average Belgian style ale. I found it a beer that one glass would suffice due to the spice and the sweetness"
"Interesting how Quebec leads the way in Canada in terms of making some gutsy brews. This one falls short of the Belgians, but compared to what Big Rock has dared and tried lately..."
"Would need to revisit this one later... I would guess my beer experience is too young to really appreciate this type of beer."
"Overall an okay dubbel but if I had to nitpick I'd say it's a little too high on the ABV and a little overly phenolic for my tastes."
"A well-rendered double, deftly balanced, the alcohol certainly obfuscated. I would cite this as a purely easy-drinking version of the style - eventual booze and ingress challenges aside, of course."
"D: High. Very balanced brew, easy to drink with only the ABV to slow you down."
"drinkability is good. the sweetness is a bit higher than i expected, but it's pretty tasty. alcohol is hidden pretty well."
"Pours a hazy reddish orange, some light brown hues, medium sized but thick light tan head, settles to a medium layer and thick ring, few lace spots but great retention. Smell is sweet and malty, yeast, brown sugar, cherries and dark fruit, raisins, spice, gingerbread, a lot of raw sweetness but not too over the top. Taste is very sweet and malty, lots of fruit, strawberries and melon, cherries, gingerbread, spices, brown sugar, honey, yeasty, orange peel, wheat, pretty interesting, nice finish. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium to high carbonation, some warmth, little bit of peppery heat going down, some alcohol. A little warm and a bit thick for a dubbel, but not too bad."
"500 ml bottle courtesy of glouglouburp. Appearance- dark ruby red, good clarity. Huge head, four fingers at least. Minimal lacing, just a soapy head patty in the middle of the glass. Nose- really spicy, licorice. Taste- big spice presence, various spices (clove,cinamon anise), dark and citrus fruits, light roast and sweet finish. Very complex. Mouthfeel- medium, low carbonation. Drinkability is good."
"Agréable, à essayer si vous êtes un amateur de bières fortes belges."
"At 9,0% alcool maybe it's a bit too much for a Double."
"D: Good."
"Derek's bottle. I have enjoyed every member of the Vobiscum lineup, the Priest Made Me Do It! representation of the brewery's offerings. Dark brown and an off-brown slightly bubbly head, with coco aroma. Rich malting, creamy mouthfeel. On the sweet side, making very drinkable the Chai spices."
"A very impressive and beautiful dubbel. A bit exhausting, knocks its drinkability down a notch, certainly not a session beer, but a very nice effort. Charlevoix is certainly producing some great Belgians. Worth a trip to Quebec and the brewpub in Baie-Saint-Paul has some really good food, too."
"Merci Serge!"
"Bottle: Poured a deep burgundy brown color ale with a big foamy head with great retention and lacing. Aroma of anis is totally dominating but still well back by some strong malt. Taste is dominating by anis with some candi sugar. I thought the anis was a bit overwhelming and could have been more balance. Body was above average and alcohol was well hidden. Nicely done overall but a better calibration of spices would bring this to world class level."
"Her taste is quite smooth and well balanced. At first the fruity and spicy flavors come out with notes of shy chocolate and cocoa. The malt comes in in an earthy warm flavors that ends it all"
"SMD"
