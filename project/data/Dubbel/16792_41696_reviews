"O = Buy this one again.  A nice, drinking beer.  Probably a good choice for people who don't like hardcore craft beers. Not sure I'd call this thing a dubbel though."

"Overall â€“ A rather easy drinking dubbel overall. All in all it is pretty good, but is noting too outrageously good."

"It just doesn't have the same ring to it that the visually-impaired rodent trio does... Anyway, this stuff pours a clear amber-garnet topped by a half-finger of off-cream foam. The nose comprises rich caramel, dark fruits, light molasses, and a bit of Belgian candi sugar. The taste brings in more of the same, with some extra candi sugar, a couple black cherries, and a twinge of green apple way in the back. The body is a straight medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a slick feel. Overall, a decent dubbel at best, one that just doesn't fully sit right with me. Maybe it's a bit sweet, maybe it's the fruit on the tongue, I'm not fully sure. All I know is that I won't be demanding another any time soon."

"Poured from a bottle into a Chimay glass. Pours a dark amber, with little head. This is the first dubbel that I've had, so I'm not sure if it's consistent with the style. Smells of dark fruit and malt. The taste is the same. It's a very drinkable."

"Poured into a stem glass, a dark mahogany color with a small off-white head. I actually inquired if I was poured the correct beer, because the appearance (and aroma) seemed very deviant from a typical dubbel. Aroma rich with caramel, molasses, and cocoa. Taste was, well, really good actually, though totally not what I expected. Rich and velvety smooth, with dark malts and chocolate up front, almost reminiscent of a sweet stout, mellowing out mid-palate to reveal more of the molasses and sweet dark sugars present in the aroma, with touches of bready yeast, cherries and plums. Surprisingly complex and very tasty. Medium-bodied and very drinkable. My friend who was with me ended up ordering 3 in a row, and I would've done the same, but I like to diversify when I'm at the bar."
"Bottle: Poured a deep hazy brown color ale with a medium size foamy head with OK retention and minimal lacing. Aroma of caramelized sugar with very subtle fruity ester is OK. Taste is overly sweet for style with notes of caramelized sugar and light dry fruits with some notes of fruity ester. Body is quite full with OK carbonation and no apparent alcohol. This one is kind of average for the style but definitely lacking some of the subtlety that makes dubbel such a great style to being with."
"The Two Blind Monks Ale was Medium Amber in color, a Little Malty at 7.0% abv, a Little Tart from the Yeast, a Little Residual Sweetness from the Belgian Candy Sugar ... very interesting. This is a good beer for any season and any time of the day or night."
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a pretty, hazy amber color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of fruits, banana, yeast. Taste is good, lots of fruits, some spice, a bit malty. Feels full bodied in the mouth and overall this is a high quality beer worth seeking out."
"O- Solid beer, a classic representation of the style, nothing too special, but not one to turn down either. The 7.0% ABV is well hidden and this is drinkable brew, just wish it stood out form the crowd a little more."
"I could have easily had another one of these after I finished this, since it was that mellow. This isn't a session beer but for someone who's never had a Belgian beer before, this would be a good introduction to a Dubbel. No spice here means that this is a textbook example of the style and certainly a step up from the previous Boaks beer that I had. Nice to see New Jersey finally toss their hat into the ring in brewing this style!"
"M-Thin and very little carination make this a highly drinkable beer, i wish there was more intense flavor from Belgian yeast. Good beer and well made. Happy to support a local brewery especially one that makes so many great beers."
"Cheers!"
"This was a pretty decent beer, nothing too interesting but it was flavorful and easy to drink. It sort of tasted more along the lines of a brown ale."
"Overall, this beer struck me more as an american amber than a Dubble. Worth trying but not worth seeking out."
"D: If it wasn't for the fact that I feel like I'm drinking sweetened liquid pennies, this wouldn't be such a disappointment. Perhaps I got a bad bottle. I've had this once before on tap and found it to be drinkable yet unremarkable, but this time around, it has a mildly offensive finish."
"D: The flavors were good, but the high amount of dryness will likely keep me from trying this again."
"d- this is a solid dubbel, belgians not really my bag, but this one is pretty drinkable."
"D: A bit gassy which may limit multiples. Distinctly malty and yeasty providing a full drinking experience where one should be enough to fill you up and satisfy."
"This is a pretty solid dubbel here from Boaks. Interesting smokiness going on in this beer, which for the style is probably a love/hate kind of thing. I think it's interesting, and overall pretty good."
"No. Not really. It's not great. It's not a particularly inspiring Dubbel. But it's not awful."
"Overall- Decent, but not worth $12 and change I paid for a four-pack."
"D - a bit heavy, but a decent belgian beer for an american brewery."
"Mouthfeel is full bodied, spicy, sweet, dry, and yeasty."
"I poured from a 12 ounce bottle into my SA pint glass. It is clear amber in color with a medium white head. The aroma is sweet and spicy. The flavor follows the nose, very estery up front. It finishes very spicey. It is medium in body and well carbonated. The styles are kinda mashed up, IMO this is a triple/dubbel that does not work for me."
"D: Unfortunately, I cannot say I will be picking up any more of this. (I did use one of the six pack in a split-pea soup, and it did enhance the flavor a bit there.)"
"Overall- A decent American Dubbel."
"Overall it is a shame, this is a hometown brewery for me and I have liked what I have tried in the past, this one was just a mess though. I would avoid."
"Overall - A good example of a dubbel"
"Pours dark, dark brown that looks deep copper when held up to light. There is a small bubbly head that dissipates quickly leaving only hints of lacing. Aroma has sweet candied sugar and caramel malts on top of the Belgian yeast backbone. Dark fruits come through as it warms. The taste is similar to the aroma with lots of yeast and sweet caramel malts. Candied sugar, figs and raisins also come out in the flavor. odd sour taste that i wasnt expecting. The mouthfeel is sticky with the sweetness and good carbonation. This is a good representation of a dubbel and quite enjoyable."
"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a weizen glass. Mahogany brown with a big off-white head, but spotty lace. The aroma included maple syrup, molasses, black cherry, and blackberry. The taste certainly featured dark fruit, but also included dark chocolate/cocoa, and dissolved into a tart/sweet finish. Overall fairly impressive flavor variety, but the feel was surprisingly thin for a dubbel. However, the thin body makes for a good 'session dubbel', if such a thing exists."
"Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into my Maredsous chalice. The dubbel appeared a murky deep chestnut color with about an inch of quickly fading of white foam. Nose and flavor are of dark fruits such as figs, dates and raisins, quite sweet with notes of candi sugar, molasses, yeast, some caramel. Hovering above medium bodied and adequately carbonated. Slightly above average across the board."
"IMO, it was a good take on a Belgian Dubbel, but I don't think the taste should have been so dry. The fruits were good, but that dryness has to be lowered. I think a six pack of this would be too much, but a single or two would be good enough."
"Aggressive pour yielded a 1/4"" head that vanished almost instantly. Lacing did stick longer but faded slowly. Body is dark and opaque red. Nose is malty, and sweet. Taste is mellow at first, some sweetness there and plenty of carbonation despite the lack of a head. Almost a dry woody taste to it, oak? I'm on the fence with this one, something is missing taste wise, not sure if its too much carbonation on the palette or if it needs to tone down. Maybe tweak the yeast a bit, has more of a German bock mouth feel to it than Belgian ale(which I think is what was implied.)"
"Notes: I didn't bother to finish the beer. Next to a solid, traditional dubbel, this beer really doesn't compare. Plenty of other beers to spend my money on and I wouldn't recommend it to others unless you are looking for a good beer for a beer pong tournament."
"I have no trouble drinking this beer but since I have a case of it I think I will let the remaining bottles hang out in the Keller and try it again in a few months."
"Poured a really nice copper/light brown with a darker brown center. The aroma is sweet caramel and malt and taste pretty much follows suit although with a bit of fruit. The mouthfeel is smooth and creamy with a easy drinkability. The best part about this beer is it's beautiful appearance in the glass."
"A: Chestnut colored, thin layer of head, quite clear - 3.50, S: Quite malty and somewhat musty, has a subtle sweetness that you might get from old dates or prunes - 3.00, T: A hint of spice or sour - it's hard to discern, a little hop bite but this beer is mostly malt, out-of-date pineapple juice, the palate isn't doing it for me, it is improving a touch as it warms - 2.50, M: Medium bodied - 3.50, D: No date on this bottle so it is hard to determine if age played a factor in this beer, it is close enough to a Dubbel to feel like I'm getting the essence of the beer, unfortunately this beer is missing the mark in my book - 2.50"
"D: A decent offering that could use a little polish around the edges."
"D: While the mouthfeel was pretty easy and yielded a nice drinking experience, the alcohol was a bit too much and took away from the overall drinking experience of the beer overall. If the alcohol was less ""in-your-face," I think that this brew could have been significantly better."
"d: I can't find much positive to say about this one. One of my least favorites so far. I didn't finish it."
"Notes from 4/20/08"
"Really excited to find this at my local beer store in both a six pack and single 12 oz. bottles. No bombers were available. I remembered reading an article about the beer and brewery in the Newark Star Ledger some months back, so I picked this up to try it out. Contrary to some reviews, I can't seem to get much of an aroma out of it. It looks like it could be mistaken for a glass of soda. Fizzy, soda-like head that's gone within seconds. Still cold- lots of carbonation, very malty taste. As it is warming, more of the flavor comes through. Lots of raisin, a little bit of caramel. Hints of earthiness as well. Too much fizzy carbonation kills the beer for me. It's a quality beer, but I'm glad I picked up a single instead of a six, I'm a bit disappointed."
"Will have to pass on this one."
"It has a medium mouthfeel with light carbonation and it finishes lighty spicy and bitterish. A good brew."
"Well done."
"There are a lot of overly-sweet and unbalanced American-made Belgians in this world, but this hits pretty close to the mark. It's a touch sweeter than the likes of a Chimay Rouge, but still holds enough balanced complexity to make it a fine beer. The aroma holds a mixture of perfume and floral phenols with a dash of pepper. The flavor expands with a mild roasted barley flavor, akin to a nut brown, but backed up by sour cherries and blackberries. My only complaint is that to be truer to style, it should be naturally carbonated. Otherwise this is a very tasty, and apparently undiscovered, dubbel. Go buy one."
"A good beer, but not the best representation of a Dubbel, one of my favorite styles. I'm a sucker for a good Dubbel, and I would have this again."
"Pours dark, dark brown that looks deep copper when held up to light. There is a small bubbly head that dissipates quickly leaving only hints of lacing. Aroma has sweet candied sugar and caramel malts on top of the Belgian yeast backbone. Dark fruits come through as it warms. The taste is similar to the aroma with lots of yeast and sweet caramel malts. Candied sugar, figs and raisins also come out in the flavor. The mouthfeel is sticky with the sweetness and good carbonation. This is a good representation of a dubbel and quite enjoyable."
"A nice dubbel to sit back with and relax."
"D: It encourages larger sips and rewards with a malty burst that I wish lasted a little longer."
"Pours a hazy deep red with orange highlights with a thin off-white head having little retention and a small ring of lacing. Smells of raisins and other dark fruits, candy, malt, chocolate, and brown sugar. Tastes of toffee and light chocolate up front followed by raisins, bready malts, and a touch of spice. Finishes slightly bitter with some pine hop presence as well as an ever so slight bit of alcohol warmth. Medium in body with good carbonation. Sticky and sweet, but lacking a lot of the spices and more of a full yeasty bread feel that other Dubbels possess. A satisfactory attempt by Boak's and enjoyable, but not among my favorites."
"D- I would believe this beer were a dopplebock or even a Scottish ale before I would guess dubbel. The only resemblance it has to a classic dubbel is the yeast presence. But hey just because ti doesn't fit in doesn't mean it isn't a good beer. This one is rich and malty with a superb mouthfeel."
"I like the Two Blind Monks Ale 'label' seen on the Boaks website much more than the one on my bottle (seen above) that looks like it was designed on someone's home computer. In the final reckoning, however, what's inside the bottle is what really matters. Bottom line: this former homebrewer needs to do a little more homework if he truly wants to recreate a Belgian dubbel."
"Pours deep copper in color with a small to moderate head that dissipates fairly quickly leaving a small amount lacing behind, but clings to the glass slightly if swished around a bit. The nose is filled with cents of dark fruits and bready yeast, this seems promising. Initial taste is much like the smell with the addition of oaky notes. Taste turns much more heavily towards the dry fruits as the glass warms to room temperature, not terribly complex but still pretty tasty. Mouthfeel is thin, but greatly helped along by carbonation. Overall I have enjoyed it, but there was nothing overly exciting about the beer."
"Tastes wet malty sweet on the pull that dries with chocolatey in the mouth. Nutty, toffee, sweetened toast, raisin, with some light-fruited esters and mild belgian phenolic character. Finish dries out leaving dry chocolate and a trace of ginger rising on light alcohol vapors. Md-full when in the mouth, but comes across lighter due to the fine carb that forms on the tongue. Well balanced flavors in intensities of comparable levels. Some time in the cellar could likely do this beer well to meld the flavors into a cohesive rolling experience. Enjoyable, but the sweet start begins to wear a bit by the end of the glass. Hits the style description very well."
"Muted mahognay in color. A bit fizzy though that is gone right away. Mellow aroma-none of the bready or malty Belgian notes I was expecting. Soft malty flavor. Slight bite to it. Fairly mellow flavor wise-nothing really says dubbel here. Still a pleasant taste to it. Belgian Dubbel for beginners? Ok body. A good beer but an ok dubbel. Just sort of lacks something all around."
"Drinks alright, if I had to guess, I'm thinking about 7-8% abv. Not a bad stab at the style"
"Taste & mouthfeel: Some toast and chocolate at first, followed by a hint of dark fruit. This is almost TOO clean for a dubbel; I'm not really picking up much in the way of estery flavors. Neither overly sweet nor dry, this beer has a fairly static flavor that becomes a bit boring over time, but it's not bad."
"Darned if I didn't find myself wanting more of this. Really well done and very drinkable."
"Drinkability: this one tends to be a bit sweet overall which grows a bit tiring after a while. But this is a pretty tasty beer."
"Pours a clear dark, ruby hued brown. Flavor is full. Nice level of spice - quite a bit of it actually. Definitely a lot of malts there. Also the caramel tones are pretty heavy as well. A full carbonation that has a bite to it that sticks around and keeps attacking on the tongue. Liquid feels good too. Very easy to drink. A very good American interpretation of a Belgian style."
"I was quite pleased. As the first offering from a new brewing company, this is different, unique and rather risky. Nice job!"
"D- Excellent, this beer drinks wonderfully. For its retail price of only 1.99 this beer is incredible. I highly recommend picking a few up if spotted."
"This was a nice first offering for me from Boak's. Definitely worth a try and definitely something I'd drink again."
"I drank the one bottle, but i would not have gone back for another. Way too sweet. perhaps this bottle was just under carbonated."
"This was my first boak's and I look forward to getting back to Oak Tree and trying some of their other offerings."
"A decent stab at the style. It has some complexities to it and it's malty - almost too sweet. But, well, it falls short of being a classic dubbel, though it has enough worthy qualities to it to be worth checking out."
"Definitely recommended..."
