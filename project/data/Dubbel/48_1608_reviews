"Pours a medium brown producing 2+ finger of fluffy, tan, moderately lasting head that leaves a nice coating of rings & webby lace. Aroma is dark bready malt, light roast, molasses, caramel & sour dark fruits. Taste is roast, dark malt, some Belgian yeast with subdued fruity esters, fig & prune, brown sugar & thin hints of chocolate. Slight hop presence detectable in the finish & aftertaste. Some burned coffee notes in the aftertaste also. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium-high carbonation, wet, juicy, little slick & very prickly. Pleasant enough dubbel but a little lacking in complexity & roundness found in the better examples."

"Solid, but there's plenty of better Dubbels"

"Nice sized light brown head slow dies above a clearish dark burnt dark reddish colored beer. Full aroma with a variety of elements with remind me most of roasted dates or prunes with a nice compliment of barley maltishness. A full taste follows but doesn't quite live up to the aroma, but still a pretty tasty half hour enjoying this import. States that it's 8% but I'll be jiggered if I can detect any of that in the taste."

"Very good tasting Dubbel, pour into a tulip glass and enjoy!"
"This beer tastes delicious but looks beautiful from the moment of pour.  Clovey taste with an eloquent balance!!"
"Found this in a gift pack of Belgian Ales at World Market around Christmas time. Very good example of the Dubbel Ale style. Abv of 8% but drinks very smoothly. Would definitely recommend and drink again."

"Full bodied and flavored dubbel with a nice tartness and old ale sweetness."
""
"Like most ales, this could also be served by tilting the glass and avoiding carbonation to be released. in that case this beer might taste stronger. this review was based on a strong pour and not much carbonation left in the beer (a preferable pour based on this style of Dubbels to my opinion)."

"Overall a good double, but not a great one. It has good flavor, but just seems a bit weak, feels a bit watered down. Compared the the best of this style, where the competition is very stiff, it can't quite stand up to the big boys."
""
"Pours a dark cloudy brown with a medium beige head. Aroma and taste is of sweet caramel, some mild toasted notes, Belgian yeast, some mild dark dried fruits, raisins and dark plums and moderate hops bitterness. Palate is a medium, slightly thick body, smooth mouth feel with good carbonation. Finishes with sweet caramel malt, dark fruit flavors of raisins and some dried plums tartness, Belgian yeast with a lingering moderate hops and caramel malt, dark fruit ending. Aroma seemed a bit light. Overall a well balanced and flavorful brew."

"o: i've passed this by so many times before actually trying it, and its a shame i did. this is a really solid dubbel. it has a lot more going on than i would have expected, and all the flavors are pronounced, yet balanced well and play off each other nicely. definitely pick this up and give it a go. the one thing i do notice that brings it down some is that buttery taste in here. its just a hint too much - but not extremely overboard"

"Overall – A “darker” dubbel with more roasted flavors then I was anticipating especially at the end. A odd, but nice take on a dubbel."

"750 ml bottle into chalice, no bottle dating. Pours slightly hazy deep ruby red color with a 1 finger fairly dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Slight spotty lacing clings on the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation retaining the lace. Aromas of big raisin, fig, pear, apple, grape, molasses, toffee, candi sugar, toast, light chocolate, herbal, floral, clove, light pepper, and yeast earthiness. Nice aromas with good balance and complexity of malt/candi sugar and fruit/spicy yeast notes with good strength. A bit musty. Taste of raisin, fig, plum, pear, apple, molasses, caramel, toffee, candi sugar, toast, light chocolate, clove, pepper, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Lingering notes of raisin, fig, plum, pear, apple, caramel, molasses, toffee, candi sugar, toast, light chocolate, herbal, pepper, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a while. Very nice balance, robustness, and complexity of malt/candi sugar and fruity/spicy yeast flavors; with a very nice malt/yeast flavor balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a moderately slick, smooth, and lightly prickly mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with zero warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very good dubbel style. Good balance, robustness, and complexity of malt sweetness and fruity/spicy yeast flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the ABV. A nicely enjoyable offering."

"Overall: Bornem Dubble is not the best example of the style out there, but it is still a solid beer, especially for something available locally. Given the price and the availability, I will probably buy this again."

"330ml bottle, poured into Leffe chalice. Colour was dark auburn, almost opaque, small tanned head which soon faded, had a small amount of lacing. Aroma was yeast, a hint of cranberry and some liquorice. Tasted cranberry, carrot, berries and yeast. Finish starts bitter and ends up biscuity. Booze well hidden. Well carbonated, slightly thick body, smooth. Overall a beer to accompany a heavy meal."

"Pours a hazy dark orange-brown with a foamy bone colored head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, dark fruit, and spices. Taste is much the same with a mild amount of spice bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer with some solid aromas and flavors that make it easy to drink."

"Poured into a chalice. Pours hazy toffee brown with a tall, biege head. Tiny bubbles can be seen rising from the side of the glass. The head dissipates slowly on this dubbel, leaving around plenty of head during consumption. Plenty of lacing is left on the side of the glass during consumption. The beer smells of bready malts and yeast, dark candi sugar, raisins, prunes, apples, and other fruits. The aroma of this dubbel is actually quite fruity. The taste follows the nose here. There is a bready malt backbone that gives way to the fruity flavors detected in the aroma. There's a bit of citrus tang in this beer as well. The alcohol is well hidden. The malt profile of this beer is very solid. The body is medium with moderate carbonation. The body is actually ligher than most dubbels, which makes this higher ABV beer highly drinkable. This is an excellent beer."

"Overall, this is a good, solid dubbel, and has obviously been crafted by brewers with years of experience."
"This is a very good beer. Like the others from this brewery, attention to every detail is paid to this beer. It may not be your taste, but it certainly won't disappoint."
"Opinion: This is a pretty good beer overall. It seems that I am actually liking their lower gravity beers more than their bigger ones. Gulden Draak is good, but not my favorite, but ranks higher than this beer. I would say that this brewery definitely knows how to make a quality beer as long as you can get a fresh example, which I obviously have with this variety pack. I may prefer other examples of this style if they were all at the same arm's reach, but this is a solid offering and one that I wouldn't hesitate to try again."
"Atmosphere is pretty good. Nice brown-red body with a foamy head and lots of lacing. Nose is woody, malty, with hints of sweetness. Almost a shallow malty flavor, with sweet and woody notes. Overall, this is a pretty good quaff."
"Skol!"
"Overall I had to knock it down a half point. This category used to be drinkability and 3.5 would fit perfectly for that."
"Drink- Was a welcome suprise in the dubbel style. A new beer and was easy to drink."
"O - near or above average for a Belgian dubbel: i.e., very good"
"O: A solid dubbel. Dubbel is a category I tend to grade very strongly, and this is one of the better efforts I've had. Weird to think I haven't had this in about 5 years. Well worth the revisit."
"A decent dubbel, maybe a little on the dry side, which is a-ok with me, as nothing is out of balance on the whole.  Not overly complex, but drinkable enough for this doubting Thomas acolyte."
"O: This is a pretty good beer. Got it in a sampler pack, and this is one of the first that didn't wholly disappoint. Well rounded, good flavors supported by a slight hint of alcohol. Very drinkable."
"D - very good but the alcohol will catch up with you fast."
"overall - this was a beer that surpassed my expecation as frankly wasn't expecting much, but this is a good entrant into the category, one that I would gladly revisit"
"This brew pours out like a pretty typical Belgian Dubbel. The color is a muddy looking brown color with a tan head. The smell of earth and some darker fruits are picked up in the aroma. Has a bit of funk too. The taste is surprisingly different than some Dubbel's out there. I kept picking up some type of sourness in the flavor. Almost like it was aged in oak or something. Not the standard flavor for most Dubbels. I can see how some may enjoy this but I wasn't really digging it."
"Overall - It might have just a touch too much carbonation but it is still an above average beer. The alcohol was well hidden and it had a nice taste. Not sure I'd pick it up again, but I'm happy I tried it."
"Overall the beer had a good pour and an interesting aroma but the taste and mouthfeel never showed up to the party."
"D: Goes down really smoothly, alcohol isn't noticeable, but it's a little too sweet."
"D: I suppose this could be ranked fairly high due to the light body and high carbonation, but the flavor fall short of the nose/style and the mouthfeel isn't what I enjoy out of great Dubbels. I can't imagine buying this again."
"Pours a deep reddish mahogany, with a tall, retentive head that will knock your socks off. I poured equal head to beer at a head-reducing angle, and had to wait a while in order to top off my glass. Tastes of ripened fruits, candy, some esters, and a hint of caramel round out this dubbel nicely. Smooth, moderate body, and sweet through the swallow, while wet in the finish. Leaves your tongue 'sweating' for another drink. An experienced craft, well worthy of an evening's enjoyment."
"D: This was light for a dubbel, very easy to drink. I'll take one more."
"D- Ehh... I'd choose most other dubbels over this one."
"D - very drinkable, kind of easy and fresh"
"jd"
"Final Thoughts: All in all an above average Dubbel. Not quite as good as the trappist offering I've had but given the right price I could enjoy this in their stead. Give it a shot."
"D- A solid Dubbel that I would pick up again."
"Giant head on this one, drank some head to keep it from flowing out of the top of the mug. Stiff, off white head of foam. Great heavy lace that does not move. Color is a 25 on the SRM beer color chart. Smell; there is grape, apple, light blueberry, lime, malt, and molasses. Taste offers flavors of white grapes, lime, apple/pear, caramel, molasses, nutmeg, and malt. Moderate feel and creaminess as it flows past my tongue. Maybe a little sweet to drink more than two together, but good flavor, maybe with apple or cherry pie."
"D-actually a really good, smooth dubbel. the ABV, i would've guessed to be half of what it is. i'd like to have more of this!"
"11.2 oz snubby Duvel style bottle into a snifter. Darker than expected, this is a dark one even for a dubbel. Head just keeps climbing and climbing. I've poured entire 22 oz chugs into this snifter and this dubbel surged almost all the way to the top. Traditional hops and Belgian pils malt and caramel malt and smoked malt come through much more than the yeast, which I find to be the dominant flavor in many dubbels. Still quite a good funkiness from the yeast though. It's surprisingly light and spritzy on the tongue. It's also quite sweet, I would say a little under-balanced on the hop side, but still a very enjoyable beer. Does it compete with any of the Trappist dubbels? Not quite, but you won't be sorry you tried one or two either."
"Drinkabilty - Kind of a odd flavor for a dubbel. Its not what i expect but overall its decent. Has enough alcohol to were 1 or 2 is good. I prefer spice and malt heavy dubbels over this. I would drink again but wouldnt seek out."
"medium body, maybe a little bit more. Not bad, but sometimes a bit weird or off, yet not in a very bad way. Interesting. Curious, but not fascinating."
"drinkability; a little toned down for the style making this a not too bad session beer. The alcohol could be better hidden."
"D - Meh. Not a bad beer by any measure, but certainly not my first choice."
"An underwhelming brew."
"D: It is honestly too drinkable for the beer style. I expected it to be something I can relax with and sip slowly."
"D - Good but not great. An average example of a Dubbel."
"I'm straining to pick up much of anything from the nose, definitely a bit of yeast, fruitiness, and a touch of alcohol on big whiffs. The taste is dark fruits and belgian yeast character up front, which gives way to a light roastiness in the surprisingly dry finish. A bit too thin and too highly carbonated. This is an easy drinker and hides its ABV quite well, but is not really anything to write home about."
"Highly drinkable, I would gladly drink again. Not the best dubbel out there but worth a try."
"Nose is bready, hint of minerals and plums, very light Belgian yeast esters. Taste is similarly light on what I would call the Belgian yeast profile, more bready and caramel, quite a surprisingly dry finish, almost bordering on chalky in the mouth, light cola sweetness, light phenols, perhaps a touch too much carbonation, borderline too thin mouthfeel. No sight of the ABV, yet everything about this screams average or just above. Easy to drink and I would drink it again but I wouldn't seek it out specifically."
"D- A good example of the Dubbel style which didn't blow me away, but earned my respect. I would be happy to drink it again, but would also be fine living without it. I'd recommend giving it a try at least once. Also the 7% is pretty hard to pick up on. This is an easy drinker."
"Very light body. Good carbonation. Overall the flavour level is quite light for a Dubbel. Due to the lightness and the well hidden alcohol the drinkability is quite high. Not to fancy but a solid drinkable Dubbel."
"Purchased as bought of a 6 bottle pack from the Control Board in Ontario. Pours an amber-brown colour with huge pillowly head with some lacing. Smells of dried fruit and caramel. Flavour is pretty mild for the style. Huge carbonation level. Just an ok dubbel, I've preferred the other beers from this pack."
"Pours a nice brown color with a nice off white head. The nose brings some bread, caramel, dark fruits, and a bit of booze. The taste combines the elements quite well with some dark fruits and a good amount of lighter Belgian yeast characteristics. Medium, creamy mouthfeel. Not fantastic, but a pretty good representation of the style."
"Drinkability: A fine beer."
"D: Would not reccomend this to someone to try for their first Dubbel. There are better examples out there. I don't see myself drinking this again. Kind of a waste."
"You can tell that the brewers dumped a ton of caramelized sugar in this. It's gross. Avoid it."
"Wud echo Todd of the Bros on the sharp chesse though...nice pairing idea"
"D: It isn't that difficult to drink this beer because the alcohol is completely masked and the amount of sweetness is subdued."
"pour release of maple syrup. then a nice earth and brown sugar. molasses bittered and not powerfully sweet. a nice character... no abv evident... and a nice coinciding quality of ester and sweetness. a dry tingle. clean on the tongue and not syrupy. only dubbel i've had that tastes better as it sits... expands... warms."
"A very approachable Dubbel, it hides its alcohol well. The flavour is well-contained, if not a little subdued, but well worth revisiting."
"Not very full so you could drink several without being too full."
"Pours a thick, light tan, five-fingered head, fades to a thin layer (should be poured slowly) and leaves traces of lace. Good carbonation and light bodied. Color is dark opaque brown. Dark fruit nose. Flavor is sweet and sour dark fruit, the higher ABV is not noticeable. $3.95 for a 330ml bottle from Colonial Spirits, Acton, MA."
"I have no idea what Van Morrison's talkin' about in ""Domino", but, dammit, that song kicks ass! Anyway, this beer pours a mostly clear ruby brown topped by a finger or so of ecru foam that fades into a surface ring fairly quickly. The nose comprises caramel, molasses, maple syrup, roasted malts, plums, brown sugar, rye bread, red apples, figs, and a hint of tobacco. The taste emphasizes the fruits up front, primarily green apples, pears, plums; a sweeter backbone comes in later, consisting of caramel, rye bread, figs, brown sugar, and cinnamon. All-in-all, flavorwise, I find this to be a bit too fruity, but not by all that much. The body is a firm medium, with a moderate carbonation and a fairly smooth feel. Overall, a solid dubbel, but not one that I would necessarily go to regularly."
"Forgettable. Not too good. Too thin."
"Easy drinking, pleasant beer. I can see having more of this."
"We have a gusher! Once under control pours a murky dark brown in color with allot of tan head and very good lacing. The smell Is a bit light with raisins and yeast being the only thing im picking up. The taste is much more prominent then the smell with an almost sour dark fruit flavor and a lingering belgian yeast. The mouhtfeel is pretty light and its very drinkable. My first belgian in a while. Not bad, not something to seek out."
"Draught @ Sharp Edge Creekhouse: This one was served in a Bornem Chalice. It poured a dark, opaque brown color with a large off-white head. Lots of lacing from this one. The aroma was lighter. Some breadyness, yeast, chocolate and subdued dark fruits. The taste is very good. Nice balance of sweetness and bitterness: it is almost neither. Hint of chocolate and roastiness to the taste. Nice blend of caramel malts and dark fruits in the background."
"This came in a variety pack. Pours a dark brown almost black in color. Plenty of carbonation and a huge head. White he'd with scents of mushrooms, raisins, little alcohol, and pomegranite. There is also a sweet hint of licorice. Starts of with plenty of carbonation that open up the flavor profile. I get licorice with a lingering flavor of raisins. Chocolate seems to also play a role. A little sweet malt balances out the alcohol profile. I like this one."
"thinnish mouhtfeel which is fine and good for me making this quite drinkable. recommended everyday dubbel. should almost bump this to 4.5."
"Overall, a quality beer. Quite enjoyable. I'd expect no less from an authentic Belgian dubbel. Not the best I've ever had, but worth a try if you're a fan of this style."
"I'm glad I was able to sample this beer in a variety pack. I'd easily buy it again if I found it on the shelf."
"D: Very drinkable. Flavorful and coplex. Disguises abc well."
"From the 330 ml. bottle marked 11HH-15:42. Sampled on May 9, 2010. It was served at about 50 degrees but unfortunately by doing so it bubbled up uncontrollably and spilled out of the bottle as I poured it into the glass. A hazy amber color with an incredibly large head that ultimately simmered down. The aroma was full of wheat, spices, and yeast but all done in a mellow fashion. The taste also had a kind of yeasty feel to it with a little bit of fruitiness, wheat, and spice. If this is typical of this one I think there are better Belgian Abbey ales out there."
"overall: overall the best double I have ever drank I have had 6 or 7 before this one including the Trappist ones and this is less sweet more complex and still gives out the wonderful fruit notes in taste and smell."
""
"Taste - Very good. Sweet with fruits like the aroma but with a complexity that I would say was almost coffee like. Maybe a little too bitter for my tastes but still good."
"Poured from a brown 11.2 oz. bottle. Has a dark brown color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is very mild, some notes of fruits and alcohol. Taste is also mild, some hints of fruits and alcohol. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and has good drinkability. Overall this is a pretty good beer."
"The beer poured with a thin head although other reviewers had better luck. The appearance is still really good and the head lingers gracefully. What I do not like about the beer is its slightly green finish. Where I rate the finish negatively I think many will appreciate the subtle hoppy undertone."
"F: A lingering juicy fruit taste. It dries off some, so not so sweet, but still has a slight lingering brown sugar sweetness. Lingering peach and apple flavors, apples comes out on the finish a lot more. Some syrupy stickiness and brown sugar roasted raisin. It's a tasty beer but has its flaws."
"D - Good beer in its class, wouldnt mind having another one in the future."
"Flavor is boring and ordinary. Its thin and there isn't much at all. It gets a little sweet, a slight roast, there is decent connectivity and the carbonation in the mouth is nice but overall its just mediocre. Don't bother."
"Overall, a decent dubbel but one of the less impressive ones I've had to date and the weakest from the Belgian six pack so far (which doesn't say all that much since Gulden Draak and Piraat Ale came first). I'd say this one's a good intro into the style, but will remain well under the staples that this style has come to be known for."
"Drinkabilty is very good. This is a very nice Dubbel, fits the style really well. I'd happily drink another of these."
"Surprisingly intact considering the time in a car."
"Beautiful carbonation and body"
"Drinkability: A decent dubbel but nothing outstanding. Worth a try but maybe not worth the price."
"Dark ruby-brown, this beer shows is rich and beautiful in colour. The well-retained beige head is tightly formed and leaves lots of lace on the walls of my chalice. Smells of tart green apple, plum, and flowery perfume. There's a hint of banana in the scent. Caramelized flavour also shows notes of green apple, lemon, and raisin. Finishes with a leafy medicinal bitterness. Just a little bit boozy. Medium bodied, with low carbonation for the style. Feels very smooth. I enjoyed this quite a bit."
"Pours dark reddish-brown with a white head. The aroma is standard dubbel, with dark fruit, candi sugar and Belgian yeast. The flavor is dominated by dark fruit but it was kind of a let down after the great aroma the beer had. Not sure what was missing, but there was something lacking in the flavor. The mouthfeel is relatively thin, thinner than I like in a beer of this style and somewhat watery. Low carbonation."
"Pours a dark red brown color body, with a big foamy light tan color head, somewhat lasting. Strong sweet malty aroma, some earthiness. Sweetness like sugar and dark fruit like plums and dark cherries. Dark fruit taste, light aftertaste. Dark cherry. Sweetness and floral notes. not too complex. Not too shabby."
"(Bottle into trappist glass) Poured a very dark brown with little to no head to speak of. Aroma very strong of plum and raisin and a hint of molasses sweet as well -- a very pleasing scent!! A little thinner on the tongue than some other dubbels I've had, but it did dance nicely in the mouth. Taste was mildly sweet, with a little more alcohol bite than I expected but it wasn't worth killing just on that account. Overall very drinkable and I would come back to this one again as it is far from terrible, but there are many better examples of the style available."
"Poured a 11.2 oz bottle into my Maredsous chalice. This beer pours a bruised cherry brown with a nice 3 inch off beige head that leaves just a subtle lacing down the glass. The aroma is classic Dubbel. Bruised fiji apples, prunes, figs, and just a little pear. A bit of chocolate and just a hint of toffee. The flavor is spot on the aroma. Definite tree fruits with apple and figs coming up strong. Slight chocolate with toast and just a bit of booze. The mouthfeel is light and creamy. I feel like this review is rather bare bones, and that's kind of what I feel about this beer. This is a good Dubbel but has nothing really exciting about it. I would definitely drink this beer again but I could never see myself picking up another bottle at the liquor store. I guess I'm lucky I got it as part of a sample pack for Christmas."
"D - Very drinkable. I prefer this to the Bornem Tripel in all respects."
"Enjoyable and very drinkable."
"Bornem II is an enjoyable beer, just not an exceptional one. I would consider buying again but the price doesn't justify it."
"The taste is dangerously seductive for a beer with 8% ABV. You won't get any hint of the alcohol. What you will find is a fairly creamy beer, for a Belgian, with lots of sweet malts, yeastiness, florals, some burnt currant flavors, some apple notes, some hop in the finish to tighten it up. The beer definitely improves as it warms. There is a ton of yeast in this beer, no surpises for a Belgian, the carbonation is surprisingly low, there is not the pricklish carbonated mouthfeel for the style, it is particularly smooth. There is a slight sourishness, with a touch of unripe green apple taste. The beer is a nice one, not my favorite dubbel, but it is good."
"A good belgian and quite drinkable."
"Maybe not the best dubbel ever, but I love dubbels and, yeah. I'd drink this again."
"Pours a dark amber brown with a redish hue about it. Creamy head is stained slightly and clinging all over the glass. Nose is full of a dark fruit sweetness, malt, spice and a bit of yeast. Taste is lightly malty with a bit of the dark fruity sweetness character that the nose let on. As it warms the alcohol comes out a bit in the aroma and a bit in the finish. This is one hell of a balanced brew. The suttle hop bitterness, the minorly sweet malt taste, the creamy finish, the linger taste of grain, the slight amount of carb tingle on the tongue, the lace upon the glass that refuses to give up...it is really enjoyable."
"drinkability: Would make a lovely brew for cooler temps and unhurried sitting around fireplaces. Certainly worth a try."
"D: Although not an outstanding beer, this is a well-rounded, well-brewed dubbel. Alcohol is masked easily, and this has an appealing balance of flavors. Not world class, but worth drinking."
"Pours a dark amber color with an amber along the bottom of the glass. 1/3 inch head of a pale tan color. Good retention and good lacing. Smells of alcohol, hops, sweet malt, dark citrus, and slight toffee or brown sugar. Fits the style of a Dubbel. Mouth feel is smooth and crisp with an average carbonation level. The mouth feel is slightly watery for a Dubbel. Tastes of sweet malt, slight hops, yeast, slight citrus, and some grain."
"750 ml caged and corked bottle. Served in a goblet, the beer pours a murky brown/red color with about an inch tan head. Lacing is good, head retention is excellent. The aroma is malty, it smells like dark fruit (raisin, cherry), caramel, and a bit of peppery spice. Taste is similar to the aroma, but there's also some molasses noticable and a bit of a tart/sour taste which surprisingly works well for this brew. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it has high but soft carbonation which lessens some as the beer warms up. Drinkability is good, it's easy and enjoyable to drink. I think this is a good overall beer, I'd try it again in the future."
"a very heady beer, abut two fingers of a light tan coloured foam. the body is dark brown, muddy and turbid with some yeast chinks floating arond. the head retains very well at the two finger level. the nose is very strong but is definitely limited in scope; it has a big malty body and some sweet fruits. the taste has the components of a dubbel but they are all out of proportion. the initial taste is too bitter, the finish is actually sour, and the aftertaste isn't sweet enough, rather, it had too much bitterness. the body is light but has a lot of carbonation to give the impression of a medium"
"D- Not bad for the style, but not the best I've tried."
"A bit underrated, methinks, but so what, I'm happy to enjoy this and hold it up as an excellent dubbel worthy of any beer enthusiast's time and money. Luckily there's all kinds of time for beer of this quality, and it doesn't take an exorbitant amount of money to acquire. Great stuff."
"My only real complaint is the lack of maltiness in the body. It is watery compared to many American, Belgian-style dubbels such as the Allagash (probably my favorite of the style), but the subtleness of the flavors are what make Belgian Abbey Ales Belgians."
"Drinkability: this beer is alright, but not good enough to really want a second."
"pairing made thsi pretty tasty however."
"Poured into a Boulevard Tulip from a bottle. The pour brought about a generous amount of head that took several minutes to subside. As I drank the Bornem the glass was ringed with lacing from each sip. The smell has a hint of plums to it but mostly you smell the wheat and barely used to make the beer. Bornem is a smooth drink, you barely notice the 8% abv and rather tasty. The combination of the slight plum taste and barely make it very palatable. It may not be the most exciting flavor or Dubbel, but the easy drinkability makes this a great beer to sit back and relax with, almost a higher abv session beer."
"Would be great with bread and sharp cheeses."
"D - This is a pretty decent dubbel. I've had better but its worth a try."
"Overall a tasty and very user friendly dubbel."
"D - Good dubbel, a little less sweet and more malty than others in the style"
"4 very good all-rounder of an ale. bet this would go well with hard cheeses and crusty bread."
"D: It isn't a chore to finish, but it's not exactly anything I'll want to seek out in the future. It isn't awful, but the market is ripe with better options for a dubbel, and this brewery has done other styles with more success. If the chemical aftertaste wasn't there, or even if it lingered only briefly, this would be a much better beer."
"The dry and crisp finish is different for a usually sweet beer. Nice job on this one."
"Serving type: bottle"
"EDIT: This beer became MUCH more enjoyable as it warmed to close to room temperature in the chalice. Smoothed out a lot and tasted better as the carbonation died down."
"M + D: Medium bodied, with a carbonation that adds a fizzy sparkle all the way down. Not a bad dubbel, by any means... I quite enjoyed the flavours, but it doesn't compare with some of the others that Belgium may have to offer - and it's not really quite up to par with the trappists at all."
"D - Easy to drink and it's a good accessible Belgian. Some are too overpowering/sweet/sour for my taste."
"This beer poured a dark copper with a two-finger tan head. The smell is mostly dark fruit with a bit of malt. The taste starts off with some sweet malt that gives way to a bit of citrusy and fruit. The mouthfeel is slightly thick with some moderate carbonation. This is a pretty drinkable dubbel. Nothing too special, but a solid little beer."
"D - could keep drinking it, but why if there's other stuff around. if you're going to session it can be done as it's not too heavy on taste or alc"
"Overall impression: This would be a great beer to enjoy on tap, ice cold, on a hot summer day. Not really one to sip and fathom the levels of taste nuance."
"Poured froma bottle in to a goblet; small head and little lacing. Smelled fruity. Taste was cloyingly sour, with some fruit presence. Since when is a Dubbel sour? Not sure if this bottle was bad, or the beer is just bad. Mouthfeel was average. Drinkability was very poor, as the flavor was a complete turnoff for me. Drain pour half way throught he glass, a rarity."
"This bottle was in my cellar about 18 months, best before 18/04/09, or less than three weeks. Dark brown with ruby edges in a bright light, tan 2 finger head with good retention and sheet lacing. Smells of caramel and vanilla wafer. Taste features malt on a base that seems surprizingly like chocolate with caramel, very appealing. Flashes of dark fruit, mostly sweet, but with the odd sour note adds interest. Extremely smooth mouthfeel, a long finish accentuates a subtle bitterness that blends in quite well. Nicely balanced and I score this high for drinkability, not overpowering but really quite a tasty Dubbel."
"Pours a cloudy amber/brown. Nose is spices and sour green apples. Taste introduces some tart dark fruit, more sour apple, finishes with some clove/nutmeg/allspice on the exhale. Taste is a little light. Mouth is thin and wet. I'd say the thinness adds some drinkability. It's a pleasant beer that does not overpower."
"Decent flavors but overall do not give a great experience."
"OVERALL: This one was tough to finish. It was a little too sweet, making me cringe slightly after every sip, and the palate was just too light, thin and underwhelming to make me want to try a second one. Not very drinkable, and one I won't be picking up again."
"An average dubbel, but drinkability is not bad. Another one that would work better with food, I think."
"Served on tap at the Rose-n-crown pub in Palo Alto, CA. Beer was served it to a brandy style snifter. Dark, dark brown in color with some reddish hues. Nice head and look to the beer leave me eager to begin drinking. Smell is impressive as well. Burnt toffee and malts dominate the nose along with some dark fruits and yeast. Taste doesn't quite live up to the look and smell but is still pretty good. Again, malt and toffee flavors pervade but malt is balanced well with some hops through the finish. Overall, I really enjoyed this beer and will be ordering it again if it lasts at the pub."
"I was definitely expecting more from this Dubbel."
"I poured this bottle into a chimay glass. It has a nice ruby color with a small head on top. The nose is rich and fruity, almost vinous, with a malty undertone. Much more malty than the typical Dubbel, with a nutty caramel flavor, though it's not too sweet; there's not as much yeasty fruitiness as the aroma leads one to expect. The body is a tad watery..."
"Notes: Very good but I still prefer the Triple and Piraat style by this brewer."
"The drinkability is my favorite aspect of this beer. Complex enough to sip the night away. Definately good stuff."
"Mouthfeel is a bit more carbonated than the other abbey ales I've had. Drinkability is probably capped at 2-3pints. Probably just 2 pints because I think the above-average carbonation would probably limit you. Myself - I only had one before I moved onto something else. It's not a bad brew - definitely interesting. I had fun trying to figure out the aroma. Even though I know I'll probably enjoy the 4-pack, I knew I wouldn't buy it again. It needs to be refined."
"Drinkability: A decent dubbel that failed to knock my socks off. A note to future dubbels -- socks: remain! Though it did pair well with the song ""Roscoe"" by Midlake."
"Pours a dark chestnut brown color with a big foamy yellowish head. Malty aroma with hints of raisin, prune, candi sugar, chocolate and alcohol. Malty chocolate flavor with cocoa, raisin, plum, candi sugar and cherry notes with a slightly sweet dry finish."
"Bright flavors, strong carbonation, with a yeasty follow up. It has a very nice flavor but the spice and carbonation are not well balanced. It's a solid beer to have on hand but would not be my go to dubbel. Would have it again."
"Yeasty taste and mouthfeel along with dark fruits. Mildly roasted flavors, a touch of sweetness, and dry aftertaste."
"D - Good for a dubbel, not too sweet, nicely balanced."
"Pours a semi-transparent ruby brown color with a large tan head with some sticking. Sweet malts in the nose, bright ripe fruit notes, mint leaves, semi-spicy yeast, grapes and some hints at citrus fruit/peel. Caramel sweetness, sweet dark fruit, wonderfully balanced by an even more subtle bitter chocolate flavor and a small bite of hops on the finish. Quaff-able, this beer is a dangerous thing at 8%. Light bodied for a dubbel but its a good one if you ask me."
"D: Not my favorite take on the style. A nice beer nonetheless. A little more complexity would bump this one up a notch."
"Pours with a generous thick, fluffy head over an amber-orange body. Aromas of yeast, crystal malt, banana and raisin are noted although a bit faint. Palate is light and fizzy, but unfortunately a bit thin. Flavors of yeast, malt, raisin, figs and some spices make a clean presence, but are a bit febrile and fade quickly. Amazingly with such a lightweight overall presentation, the 8% alcohol is virtually undetectable. In general, not a bad Dubble, but a bit watery and average."
"The mouthfeel makes it a bit more special, to me. The effervescence holds up incredibly well, and the texture is smooth and malty. It's not quite in Ommegang's league, but Borneum Dubbel is quite good, a mistake-free beer that plays it a bit safe but nails what it does do. Well done."
"No problem drinking this beer, but almost seemed a bit harsh to overcome the mouthfeel."
"drinkability is good, just a shame i'll probably never have it again"
" A very refined dubble."
"Notes from and tasted on 7/12/04"
"Drinkability is very nice. A dubbel that invites quaffing but of course at 8% abv you don't want to go there"
"Tastes again of bubbles and overcarbonation, yet improving with time and exposure. Interestingly, this is a beer that can stand on it's own and offers a deep malty belgian nose when given a chance to shine. Slightly sweet on the finish as for the style, otherwise quite drinkable..."
"kevin"
"Notes: A really solid Dubbel. It doesn't seem to take many chances but it delivers on its promise so it gets a thunbs up from me."
"Poured into my Corsendonk Christmas Ale glass a very nice reddish/amber color, nice carbonation, very nice one-finger plus foamy/creamy off-white head, lots of nice sticky lacing follows. The nose is malty, with some yeast, dark fruits. The taste is sweet, malty, slightly yeasty, some figs, raisins, plums notes. Medium body. Drinkable, this is a nice one, recommended."
"Light-medium in body with an abundance of fine carbonation, Bornem is a very drinkable dubbel."
"Drinks alright, not a real engaging dubbel might be better with some age on it"
"Has a color not unlike cola with a thick sandy head, really noisey bubbles. Smell is spicy and a bit nutty, also a bitter apple scent is present. Taste is also a malty nutty taste with a spice finish, kind of dull for a Belgian . This beer has alot of bubbles impacting feel, making it very sudsy. Not a bad taste though and pretty drinkable, nothing repulsive to turn me off by it. Its a pretty mellow beer with just enough excitement going for it to keep it from being boring"
"Drinkability is great, one of my favorite dubbels of all time. Full of flavor, not to strong, readily available and reasonably prices, I'm not sure what one could ask for from a dark Belgian. I really wish I had another of these on deck, because one wasn't enough. Plus, it brings lots of nostalgia for me. There was a bar in college that had these for a dollar each (on tuesdays I think), it was my first real intro to Belgian beer, and for that reason, still holds a place in my heart. Plus, Van Steenberge is basically the house brewery for the Sharp Edge, which was my first beer bar. I've probably had 40-50 of theses, yet none in the last few years, which was a bad call!"
"Bought in a six pack of beers from Belgium. Served in a 11.2oz bottle. Everything about this beer in relation to Begians was average to me. There was virtually no lacing although it poured an impressive head. Smell was malty and somewhat boring. Taste was good with a really nice mouthfeel. I could have two of these but that would be about it."
"D - A fairly well done Dubbel, but not a masterpiece by any means. At this ABV in this style, there are better options."
"A 750ml bottle served in a tulip glass. The beer was an amber color with a thick tan head that resembled whipped cream. A very appealing beer. The aroma was malt, some sweet fruit, and a little spice. Taste was similar, althought the taste of pear was the predominate flavor. The malt was there, though, and that nice yeasty taste you get with Belgians. A little bit filling."
"D - Good beer."
"Note: This was part of the ""Global Beer Network 6 Living Flanders Ales"" 6-pack. Expensive, but an awesome opportunity. More brewers should do this."
"d: overall a good beer but it was never the best to begin with; just an ok belgium and 18 months hasn't changed that ity is just ok"
"Not a bad drink. That's two beers down and four more to go in the Stubby Belgain Invite. Coming tonight will be Bornem's bigger badder Tripel."
"D= An ok dubbel, but I expected more from the brewery that brought us Piraat, Augustijn, and Gulden Draak..."
"This dubbel seems to be missing something, although I'm not sure what. It has the flavour, the smell ... but it lacks satisfaction. This seems to be the case with most all the Van Steenberge beers - they are fair, often good, but never great examples of the style. I enjoyed this, but to be sure I kept wondering why I wasn't enjoying it just a touch more..."
"I enjoyed this brew. It had a nice roasted-malt stout character, only a little lighter. This has big time alcohol, so sipping is a must. Cheers to the Belgians once again."
"Notes: It has a decent flavor and kick of alcohol."
"D: Decent drinkability but is a little thin and light per style."
"The taste is not bad but it does little for me being mostly lightly burnt caramel with a nice acloholic quality, caramelized grain, toast, and wine. It has hints of black pepper, Dr.Pepper, and fruit. It's fairly dry, with little sweetness or bitterness, complemented by light, tangy sourness. All flavours, especially the more interesting ones, seem muted and tend to become more vague."
"D: Not very tasty, goes down ok, not too filling, good kick, not the best representation of style, I really didn't like this beer very much and would not want to drink it again."
"Not a bad dubbel, but there are much better out there. I'll try their trippel next just for comparisons sake."
"Bitter yeast taste. Certainly refreshing and yet a little overpowering. Tingles on the tongue. Pretty average mouthfeel and drinkability."
"Comes out a very dark brown, hazy colour with a massive head. Had to be careful pouring this into the glass. Head is a bit brown as well. A few shades lighter than chocolate milk. Strocn scent of molasses and rum. Bit of raw sugar, plums and caramel as well. Very sweet tasting. Plenty of rum and warming alcohol. Bit of honey and dark fruits as well. Finishes slighty sour with some apples and warming alcohol. Very thick, heavily carbonated mouthfeel. Mouth smacking, actually. Definitely an above average beer, but nothing pops wow. Worth a try, but no need to stock up."
"12oz bottle from 2007 Christmas gift pack from LCBO in Toronto. Pours a very dark brown with a billowing white head. Excellent lacing. Medium malty aroma. Flavour is initially a bit sweet and tangy. The light sweetness sticks around as the malt finish arrives. Decent stuff probably, but dubbels aren't really my thing, and this one doesn't prove otherwise."
"D - It's a really good tasting beer, but I really hate waiting for 15 minutes for the head to settle. :("
"D--not really a session beer at 8.0 ABV, but drinkable at this level and certainly not disagreeable."
"Poured into a goblet and received one of the biggest heads I ever had seen, but it eventually died down and left lace patches. Almost a black hue, but more dark brown with rubish tints and good carbonation. The smell is very citrusy/fruity, like oranges or pears or grapes. Not overbearing like a weiss/wheat, but it overpowers the malt. Hints of bread are there too. The taste went back and forth, as there are malts that hit the tongue first but then a sour tartness (sour apples, white grapes, I don't know) takes over. Some of this dryness stems from a 8% ABV that I did not think was hidden very well and the spices they threw in, but it does go down fairly smooth for a highly malted medium-bodied, slight yeasty abbey ale. Not that great of a dubbel and probably my least favorite from the Van Steeneberg sampler, but still decent overall."
"good drinkability here. it goes down quite quick for it's 8% abv, and i have to say this was a pleasant surprise, i wasn't expecting too much but it turned out to be a real solid dubbel"
"Poured from a 11.2oz fat little bottle. Came as part of a gift pack it seems many people on here got for christmas. Huge foamy head, literally standing over the rim of the goblet. dark-cola-like color. smells of smokyness,malts,cocoas.Taste is very good, smokieness, dark fruits,figs,a slightly tart finish. The brew has a sweet taste, but is not overly sticky, lighter mouthfeel and the tarter finish are things I appreciate in this."
"Pours dark brown with a frothy white head. Smell is only good, not exceptional by any means. Mouthfeel is good. Has feel like a sparkling wine. Very active. Tastes are strikingly tart but thin out to a fruity taste. Apples and spices. Great drinkability! 8% alcohol is not detected! This is an excellent beer. One of the better I've had lately. Probably won't see it again since it was in a holiday pack. Try it!"
"Bottle conditioned and courtesy of the local LCBO as part of a Belgian beer gift-pack. Appearance-wise we have a rocky white head and dark brown body. Very ripe fruity scent, is pleasing. Smoke and coffee in the flavour, along with spices. Very enjoyable."
"From an 11.2 oz short, fat, bottle copped in a six-pack gift set entitled ""6 Living Beers of the World"" from Gary's in Madison, this double abbey ale with a beautiful appearance pours a dark red, coca-cola-like brownish appearance with an immense frothy head that had some serious staying power... smell was about average for the style, nothing above and beyond, but the taste was great... figs, prunes, and dark-cherry like flavor with serious maltiness and a nice alcoholic glow... somewhat nutty, fruity flavor with a great mouthfeel and easy drinkability for an 8% ABV... can't taste the alcohol behind a wonderful cornucopia of flavors... never heard of this brewery or beer before, but loved the taste... Definitely recommended..."
"The yellow label review (scored 3.55) Looks murky brown with a large head of course that takes a long time to calm down. On the nose it seemed like very sweet grape skins. The taste has a very slight bitter edge with a mild and somewhat citrus tone. It seems to be a bit lighter than what I would expect from a dubbel as I would expect some more flavor. In the future, I would most likely not go for this one again as I feel there are better examples out there."
"D  A good beer but not typical of the style. Lacks balance and sweetness."
"Had this one on tap the other night. The brew poured to a darker brown color with some red highlights shining through. Nice sized head that left a fair amount of lacing along the sides of the glass. The aromas are nice, raisin/prune, slight chocolate and caramel, tart cherries that give it a slight sour smell. The taste is quite smooth and follows in line with the aromas but the sour aspect of it seems to come out a little more. To be truthful, I was surprised that this is a double as it did not seem to come across that way. Muted spice and alcohol feel with a noticeable tart/sourness. Though it say this, I must also state that I really liked this brew. Very easy drinking and if at 8%, a brew that could get you in trouble."
"Tastes of sweet malt, toffee, lots of dark fruits and spices. I wish this beer was as good as it looked, still a good brew none the less."
" Palate is mildly sweet dark malt up front, with some earthy undertones. Notes of molasses and brown sugar are evident before the swallow, while a mild bitterness from the hops comes through on the finish. Body is a bit thin and highly carbonated, which may not be completely true to style. Still, the mouthfeel is nice and pleasant. The considerable alcohol in this brew is well-hidden, yielding a highly drinkable beer."
"Definately not a session beer, but one to try. Grab one and experience it for yourself!"
"Drinkability - I would definitely have another. Great taste. I liken it to Abt 12."
"D - Slightly disappointing. It's definitely not a bad beer, but I hold Abbey style beers (especially ones that are actually from Belgium) up to a slightly higher standard and this is pretty mediocre. It looks stunning, but falls short in the complexity department."
"A good drinker. I wonder if the first impression was merely due to temperature. I would suggest letting this warm up a little. But I would drink it again."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, vinuous, sweet and tart up front to a semi dry finish. Some complexity in this beer keeps it afloat."
"drinkability is ok. fairly balanced. too much carbonation and closer to a belgian pale than a dubbel. still, fairly enjoyable, especially once much of the carbonation has escaped."
"Drinkability was horrid. A drainpour for me"
"I wish that the smell and taste here were a bit more complex. This beer has a lot of good things going for it (especially the look), but unfortunately it comes out seeming mediocre. My biggest quip is that is feels practically light-bodied."
"o: Dunno... there are other Dubbels of better pedigree."
"Drinkability: Not a great dubbel but has an interesting flavor profile that makes this worth seeking out - a bit different with its tart cidery aspect"
"I much prefer the Tripel."
"This was a nice, somewhat average dubbel. It doesn't stand out in any particular way. I'd give it another shot on tap if the opportunity ever presents itself."
"It pours a dark brown hue, with a fluffy white head that goes down pretty quick. It has a sweet aroma, and a fruity taste. Kind of like a white grape. As it warms up the fruit taste starts to disapate, but light on the palate, so it usually does not get that warm."
"Mouth: Really easy to drink, except for the large solid floaties that I ended up chewing on. Front of beer is, as the aroma indicates, quite fruity, along with some floral notes. Finish is extremely smooth roast flavor that lingers with a bit of charcoal taste. Not extremely complex, there seem to be only two layers: the fruity, spritzy front and the roast malt finish. The mouthfeel is a bit over carbonated and then dies in the back. Flavor is of a nicely done double, nothing too fancy but very easy to drink."
"Overall, recommended. Interesting the differences between the draft and bottle pours."
"This beer poured a dark brown with a huge head  nice lacing. The aroma is spicy, sour and slightly floral. The taste is sour and fruity. It is also somewhat spicy. The mouthfeel is thin to medium bodied. Overall, this is an interesting beer, but might be a bit to sour and fruity to be highly drinkable."
"Overall, a good beer to relax by, but there are much better dubbels out there. This one was rather simple, lacking complexity and depth."
"Pours a cloudy apple cider looking color with a very large foamy head. This beer has a ton of carbonation and the head is huge,thu it doesn't leave any lacing. The smell has a real ""bisquity"" aroma to it along with sweet candy sugar and carmel, dark fruits,and malt. The taste has sweet tart apples, alcohol, citrus flavors,and hops. Not bad,but it is very tart. This tastes more like a hard cider tyhan a double. The m/f is light with the flavors mixing Ok,but the tart fruit flavor really overpowers this beer. Not bad,but i'd look elseware for other Belgians."
"Drinkability - A nice beer but the high carbonation is tough on the tongue and distracts from what could be a better brew."
"D: Good dubbel. Fits the style well with good balance. This isnt the most complex dubbel you will find but ist represents the style very well."
"Drinkability- It was very enjoyable and not hard to drink"
"Drinkability- Not bad. Don't know how representative it is of Belgians, but it ain't half bad."
"Pours with rapidly expanding carbonation into a snifter a dark burgundy color with merlot highlights. Nice head. Aroma of nuts and dark fruit. Creamy. Tastes like cherries, toffee, dates. All malt, no hops to notice. Slightly grainy texture in the finish but thats it. Nice carbonation, light on the palate, drinkable but not exciting."
"Just a slight easy pour sent the head to the top of my glass. I've seen this with alot of Belgium beers. Extreme head like 3 inches thick . Looks like a milkshake with tons of thick thick lacing left as it slowly dissolves. I have to pour a bit then wait and pour then wait because the head is about 80% of the glass. It's actually over-carbonated which makes it hard to drink. Has a strange aroma that's hard to place. Roasted malts with a metallic aroma maybe. Extremely well-crafted to yield this much head. Aroma kind of smells like tomatoes. If I can get the head to reduce I can actually taste this and finish this review. Extreme carbonation reduces the quality of the mouthfeel and finish. It leaves it real fizzy like seltzer water. It expands in you mouth like foam. That will reduce the drinkability for me also. Very dry bitter finish with hints of roasted malts and grains. Dark amber in color. Body is a bit watery from the monster head I presume. The ABV is well-hidden. Overall this beer is good but the carbonation is just too much."
"I liked Bornem Tripel quite a bit and I think just as highly of Bornem Dubbel. Since I don't drink beer of this style very often, I'm unlikely to pick this one up again. There are too many other dubbels that score higher on the ol' excitement meter. That doesn't mean, however, that I didn't enjoy each and every drop."
"I cannot recommend this beer as the off-tastes are too pungeant to enjoy."
"Poured a very deep brown color with a massive tan head that took its time dissipating. Left some nice lacing. The smell is metallic and a bit spicy, nothing too distinct. Taste is of grape juice and chocalate malt, some spice. The ale is well bodied and fizzy, finishes a bit dry. Its a decent dubbel but short of good. Nothing I would seek out but nothing I would turn down."
"Drinkabitlity: Not bad fairly balanced gets better as it warms"
"The mouth is quite light, with extreme carbonation--I think a little less might supply this brew some much needed depth. It's not complex, and not drinkable due to a lack in character. I consider dumping it, but the Van Steenberge mixed six pack was nearly $18, so I'll consume it fast for the 8% alcohol."
"Things go only slightly down hill from here, notes of more rum, raisins, soft spice, dark candi sugars and bready, sweet Belgian style goodness. Perhaps a bit thin flavorwise and nothing really special mouthful wise. All in all, a real worthy and heady Belgian Dubbel."
"D: Matching up against other Belgians id have to say it was only average or slightly better. But hey, they cant all be Draak's. Im glad i tried, but its not one my wish list."
"Not something that I would seek out again, but I certainly wouldn't turn another one down."
"Overall, this beer is not what I expect from a dubbel."
"I'll finish this glass, but not sure I will seek this one out again."
"Another relatively weak link in the van Steenburge pack -- the Bruegel was nothing spectacular either (though the Augustijn was nice and the Gulden Draak was phenomenal). I meant to sample the Trippel tonight, which I've heard better things about, but pulled out the wrong bottle. Oh well. I wouldn't turn down one of these if offered, but I'm not about to purchase one on its own either."
"and it tastes like a dubbel.. initially. then it opens up the palate to a world of sour debauchery.. taste thievery. flavor robbery and broccoli piracy. the yeast plays a powerful trump card here, starting each sip off with a flavor-inhibiting kick. not too dry but zesty with carbonation, this beer evolves into the ultimate butter grease finish. its so smooth and lardy, i almost don't want to swallow for fear of excessive lubrication in my digestive tract. i see i reviewed this beer before, and i'm hoping i had an equally abysmal view. this is a beer to be avoided at all costs. i could homebrew something better in my flaking non-stick saucepot."
"Overall, this is oddly sour, but not unpleasant. Refreshing and easy to drink."
"Like its Breugel ale cousin, vinegary odors on the nose. I let it warm up some but this sour backbone was ever-present, almost distracting. Stongly carbonated, lively mouthfeel. Until it sat in the glass 20 minutes, the popping bubbles left a metallic aftertaste which faded away eventually. Caramel malt with some cinammon spicy notes, pronounced roasted character on the finish. The overall impression was a strong bottle-conditioned Belgian dubbel but the various components (sourness, maltiness, carbonation, spice, roasted notes) didn't come together harmoniously and the brew felt disjointed. Towards the end of the glass it hung together better but I wasn't feeling like having another. Maybe this beer will settle down with a year of cellaring? An interesting beer nonetheless, I will happily try it on tap if I come across it to give it another try."
"A good solid beer, definitely worth a shot."
"Snarfed a bottle, different label than the one pictured ""blue"". I was darker than I expected but was a nice onyx color. Nice subtle smell, light malty aroma. The taste was typical belgium duble, with a slight lean on the roasted malty side. Chestnuts. The mouthfeel was quite full and a little foamy. It was very nice to drink but did not stick out above to make itself a famous beer . However m if I ordered this while in Belgium, I would be quite pleased."
"Poured out a hazy mahogany color with big rippling off white head, decent lacing. The nsoe was full of brown sugar, sweet and rich Belgian candi, and scents of raisins or plums... a little spicy. The taste offered malt with some hop bitterness, a plum liek flavor, and chocolate in the finish. Mouthfeel is fairly carbonated, a bit sour, finishing dry and crisp."
"Looked amazing when I poured it in the st. bernardus chalice. Thick sticky tan head. Stuck around about a half a finger thick the whole way through. The smell was not that grabbing though I could smell the familiar scent of dubbel flavors. The taste, well it tastes watered down sort of. I agree with the goes down like water feeling among this crowd. But I must keep in mind that this is 8% and that thought the flavors are subtle in discernability, they are there and pleasing. The mouthfeel is very smooth, very watery, but it tastes of dubbel so I am satisfied. Knowing it was 8% forced me to drink it more slowly despite the watered down feeling. The flavors come out more as it warms of course also."
"Pours a hazy brown/orange, huge white head forms, massive lacing, great retention, looks nice. Smell is sweet and malty, some toffee, alcohol, spices, chocolate. Taste is nice and caramelly, very rich, some chocolate notes, tad too sweet but definately not cloying. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with high carbonation, some nice alcohol warmth. Not bad at all, I enjoyed it."
"D - Delicious."
"Drinkability: Good drinkability...this beer hides the ABV well."
"Bottle: Poured a deep amber color beer with a thick off-white foamy head with great retention and lacing. Aroma of candi sugar is pretty dominant with some distinctive Belgian yeast. Taste of sweet malt with candi sugar is dominating and a bit  too one-dimensional for my own taste. Body is also a bit thin but alcohol is well hidden."
"Smell was of honey, beet, hops, and clover. Tasted like a caramelized white ale, with a piney alcohol afterbite. Truely delicious."
"Smells sweet and fruity. Dark brown murky body with several fingers thick head that dissipates slowly leaving a fair bit of lacing. Fruit (raisin?) dominates the flavor. Also seems slightly earthy to me... Very sweet. Alcohol is almost not apparent. Surprisingly drinkable. Fairly light bodied for the syle. Very pleasant."
"Pours a dark, raisiny brown with a big bubbled head featuring loudly-collapsing bubbles. The head falls to a 2 centimeter thick, much denser covering of bubbles that never leaves. Beautiful aroma of malted chocolate, grape bubblegum, slight vanilla, and candi sugar, with hints of a slight tartness. That tartness is the first thing to appear on the palate, then a nice, smooth and not-too-intense sweetness at the mid palate. Toward the end, those grape flavors come back, along with a bit of sourness, like a much milder version of a Flemish red. Mouthfeel is medium, with juicy carbonation and a pleasing, demi-sec finish. Overall, this is not your usual dubbel, mostly due to those sour fruit aromas and tastes, but that uniqueness is pretty cool. It's not normal, but still very good, with lots of interesting flavors and food pairing possibilities."
"(330 ml / 11.2 oz short squat fat brown bottle)"
"This was a pretty drinkable beer for something with that much lactic acid presence."
"Somewhat unusual for the labeled style. Tastes like a hybrid dubbel and flemish brown ale."
"A pretty decent dubbel here. Nice creamy head, sweet fruity, almost lemony taste to it. Nice bite as well. Great lacing down the glass. Very drinkable, it just smells very whiskeyish, which was the only offensive part of the beer. I will definitely drink this one again."
"Overall, a malt-lovers beer for sure. Has pretty high carbonation, thick mouthfeel, and a fruity/malty taste. Definitely worth a try."
"D - Drinkable, definitely. Not the best dubbel I've had, but not a bad one by any stretch."
"On the palate is a Sprite soda like citrus character that melds well with an overall sourness to the whole palate. Finish is short and not very appetizing. Where's the finish? I can't taste the finish!?!"
"Nothing spectacular, but good."
"Drinkability was the same as taste and mouthfeel."
"330 ml stubby bottle, bought in Frederikshavn, Denmark. Pours with an enormous and lasting creamy greyish light tan head, underneath the head a reddish brown beer very slowly appears. Pleasant and quite strong fruity and yeasty aroma, notes of bakery, spices and ensilage too. Flavour is sweet and fruity, notes of caramel malts and mild spices too, slightly acidic finish. Good beer."
"Notes: A beer on the sweet side thats done very well. The smell is destroyed by the metallic mcgillicutty. Belgian yeast saves the day."
"The taste is not quite as sweet as the aroma would suggest, but it has a definite fruity sweetness to it. Notes of raisins and sweet plums combine with a rum-like mix of alcohol and sweet caramelized grain. The beer is quite light on the palate, a large part of this is the ample carbonation, which causes the beer to dance across the tongue. As it loses a bit of the carbonation it smoothes out a bit and picks up a bit of body. This is a pretty simple beer, yet the fruitiness is pretty nice, makes for a very quaffable brew."
"Not bad I guess, but not the best."
"Not world class...but not bad."
"Simply, the aroma writes a check that the flavor just cannot cash. Very little of what I could smell found its way to my palate, at least not in a way that I could definitively note. The ABV goes along with these limitations to make drinkability a debatable issue. Apparently, not everything in Belgium needs to make its way westward."
"A generous gift from a friend, this beer is a murky reddish-brown color, topped with a mountainous off-white head. Huge rocky foam and tight, solid lace. The aroma is malty and earthy. Theres caramel, ripe fruit, and some phenolic notes. The beer has a yeasty flavor, combined with a nice malt centerpiece. Its not really sweet, and the finish is mostly dry. Pretty high carbonation and a medium-full body. As far as Belgian Dubbels go, this ones essentially middle of the road."
"This stuff is what it is, a Dubbel that shout's out Belgium, all the way to the end...very well done!!!"
"If you're not careful in pouring this one you'll up with a ridiculous 6"" head that takes a long time to go down. Once it finally does you'll see a dark red or reddish brown body and off white head. Steady but minimal carbonation. I smelled baked beans and incense. Taste-wise it was caramel with a light fruitiness. Very smooth mouthfeel. Good aftertaste. Very drinkable."
"-Oelergud"
"Yum, a fine dubble. This pours a monster head out of the bottle. This head is so thick, additional pouring sends brew down the sides of the foamy beast-amazing. The smell is subtle, a nice malty aroma, with additional fruity scents, and a tiny bit of yeast. No alcohol aroma. The taste is some what sweet with just a tiny hint of citrus. The mouthfell is crisp. This is an incredibly drinkable beverage, especially at the ABV. It is hard to imagine that anyone would not enjoy this nice Belgian."
"D - This is my first Dubbel and I like it. I definitely plan on trying more."
"Poured a deep garnet color with massive chunky tannish head. Head lasted to the last drop with nice lacing. Smell is dark fruity with some candy caramel hints present. Taste is very enjoyable with many dark fruity notes (cherries, plums) present. At the finish a bit of alcohol comes through, along with the dark fruit as a reminder of what your are drinking. Nice drinkablity"
"The mouthfeel is fairly sharp. The carbonation levels are insane, hence the gushing out. Maybe too much priming sugar? Not one of the more drinkable dubbels I've encountered. I'll pass in the future."
"Cheers!"
"Had this one at Point Brugge Cafe in Pittsburgh. Poured from a brown stubby (love those bottles!). Dishwater brown color in the glass. Hints of caramel, cinnamon and banana bathing my sense of smell. A bit of harsh alcohol as I taste it but other than that a bit too much carbonation, this tastes pretty good. Sweet with caramel overtones. Pretty solid representation of the style in my opinion."
"11.2 oz brown stubby bottle with no freshness date. Pours a deep amber brown with a huge head, decent longevity and equally decent lace. Yeast and fig smells mix with grape aromas. Rich caramel malt and brown sugar smells as well. Brown sugar and rich malt flavors, neither of which seem overwhelming. Harsh alcohol flavors as well. Warming with decent hop bitterness (for a dubbel that is). A decent dubbel but nothing special. There are much better ones out there. Still enjoyable though."
"I definetly would have one of these a month, very good."
"Go ahead and include the yeast in your glass. You wont regret it."
"Taste is WAY too sweet for me. Cloying, candied fruit and artificial sweetner flavours. A slightly sour rotten fruit aftertaste. Not my kind of beer at all."
"Figs, plums, raisins? I couldn't tell which one dominated. This was a fine dubbel, head didn't last like others said. Poured in a goblet glass off the tap at the yardhouse, this dubbel hit the spot after a night of drinking. Yeast wasn't overpowering, a very well-balanced brew if I may say."
"D: Very approachable, well balanced & digestible. The carbonation is the limiting factor."
"Great darkish amber with a head that I almost overpoured it was so feisty. Fruity all the way thru, lots of sweet apples and white pepper. Reminds me somehow of Newcastle Brown, but concentrated and improved. One of the most drinkable dubbels I've ever had. Very clean finish, all you want is another."
"Clear, dark amber/red colour topped by an enormous light tan head. Big, clumpy lace. Cinnamon apple aroma with some bready yeast character. Mild flavour, starts with a bit of brown sugar sweetness and finishes with a dry cinnamon spiciness. Faint cheesy hop flavour peaks through along with some warming alcohol towards the end. Very high carbonation with a light body. Not bad, but the character is a little weak, making it a fairly average beer."
"Some fruit flavors, cherries, raisons and plumbs but also a lot of alcohol. Some alcohol warmth can be expected from a beer that is 8% but it is a bit too raw in this double."
"Purchased in a mixed holiday 6 pack at the LCBO in Sarnia, Ontario. The pour was of a deep ruby with a full huge creamy rocky ice cream like head, wow. The nose was not big but yeasty and winey, vinious. The flavor had nice notes of toffee, with some slight fruitiness. Mouthfeel is winey and dry finish is very long and interesting, nice."
"This is a pretty good beer. It isn't the best Belgian I've had, but it interested me because it goes through significant changes as it warms - from fruity to sweet, with alcohol presence rising quickly then dissappearing completely. Nice to drink, and worth a try."
"Huge head that demands carefull pouring. The nose is dark fruit and old hops, the first taste is quite full and big. Lots of deep fruitiness that finishes semi sweet. Not as complex as some dubbels but still a well made beer that is both smooth and complete. Would drink again for sure."
"Drinkability is pretty good on this, except for the long wait from pour to drink."
"Drinkability -- I liked it. Not my favorite, but I'd try it again."
"Overall = An ok sipping beer but not one I care to try again. It's just too unrefined lacking a lot of diverse flavors."
"A decent dubbel; highly drinkable. The flavors are nice but subdued. A decent version of the style."
"I found this brew to be decent and easy to drink. I enjoyed the complexity and balance."
"330 ml bottle. Pours out dark brown with a huge light brown head. Big malty aroma with toffee and dark fruit. Reminds me of the aroma of a strong dopplebock. Malty flavor, but not as malty as I expected from the aroma. It starts off with a blast of malt, but it disappears in the mouth with the bubbly carbonation. Some nice chocolate flavors. The finish is spicy and just a little tangy. Medium mouthfeel. Alcohol is noticable. I really enjoyed the complexities of this beer, but at $4 for a small bottle it's not something I'll drink too often."
"11.2 oz bottle pours a cloudy reddish brown with a huge light brown head that seems to last forever, leaves a beautiful sticky lacing in my glass. Fruit, spicy aromas, flavors of plums, chocolate, caramel and cloves. Medium bodied with a nicely carbonated crisp mouthfeel, finishes a bit dry."
"D - It isn't a chore to finish, but it's not exactly anything I'll want to seek out in the future. It isn't awful, but the market is ripe with better options for a dubbel, and this brewery has done other styles with more success. If the chemical aftertaste wasn't there, or even if it lingered only briefly, this would be a much better beer."
"11.2 oz bottle with no freshness date. Poured a deep cloudy brown in my chalice with a nice 2 finger head that lingered throughout the beer. Beautiful appearance! Taste was very average which was disappointing for such a good looking beer. I waited for it to warm up hoping it's character would appear, but nothing doing. Worth trying once, but there are much better dubbels out there."
"Overall - On OK dubbel... worth a try once, but there are better ones out there..."
"Good, but not a great Dubbel."
"Another decent dubbel."
"From a sampler picked up at Half-Time.This beer produced a huge frothy tan head. The color was cloudy dark brown and with garnet colored highlights. Hardly any lacing left as beer was consumed. The smell was hoppy, floral with hints of dark ripe fruit -cherries?? The taste had a slight sourness and was fruity with good sweet malts and slight sweetness like ripe berries. The mouthfeel was little thin and and the sour notes and sediment made it seem almost chalky. Abundant carbonation . This was a decent dubbel. will have to try again.."
"11.2 ounce bottle."
"From the Belgium sampler pack. Dark coffee color with a huge tan head that slowly fades. Nose is yeasts and strawberry, like sweet pie filling. Taste is sweet and fruity (berry) with a hint of licorice. The alcohol is definitely there, but does not detract. Smooth, evanescent feel on tongue. Quite good overall."
"All in all, a relatively tasty brew. Would I spend $3.29 for another 12 oz's? Probably not. It's a decent belgian, but nothing to write home about IMHO."
"Drinkability- Tasty sour brew with nice flavors. Bubbly, but good."
"Muddy water, topped with a gorgeous, full, taupe head. Excellent retention, great lacing. Keeps a solid 1/4 inch of head throughout the entire glass. The head clings to the glass after each sip, shimmering down with the aid of the beaded condensation on the outside of the goblet. Mesmerizing. Very juicy smelling, with a solid chocolatey malt base and plenty of esters and phenols to go around. Mild floral hops in the background, with notes of plum, pear, green apple and white grape. The first sip reveals an immediate sweetness. Sugary chocolate and yeasty malt, drizzled with apple butter. confectioners sugar and plum juice. Some plastic-like phenols and anise in the finish, with a spicy, tangy yeast kick supplementing the floral hops. Some wheat malt sourness? A pleasing tartness counteracts the initial sugary malt. Charged carbonation, medium to full bodied. Terrific."
"Short squatty bottle unleashed a wealth of carbonation and aromas. The nose reveals strong fruity and tartness. Brownish-red to copper colors, slightly off from clear later reveals good head retention and classic belgium lace. Flavors reconfirm cidery fruitiness and lambic-like tartness. Alcohol pronounces itself early and follows through to the finish. Although impressive in its boquet and zestiness, it lacks a bit of the sweetness and body that I have come to expect in Belium Dubbels"
"Drinkability: A little bit to winey for a dubbel in my opinion. Not quite crisp enough."
"Bottle: poured a dark opaque chestnut brown with ruby highlights. Large tan cap reduces to a 1cm cap that stays...good lacing....good aroma like bananas with treacle and a light musty note. Substantial malts but medium-light , spritzy-slick body.... slight sour twang up front reminiscent of a Flemish sour red... then a flood fruit taste blanketed in burnt brown sugar...wet finish with some sour drying. A very drinkable abby dubbel"
"Examples like this are why dubbles are starting to become my favorite style."
"This beer pours a golden brown color with a large off-white head. I purposely attempted to pour this with a minimal head and still got an inch that later subsided to about 1/2 to 1/4 inch. The smell is interesting, not unlike a black-cherry soda. The taste is a bit sour, and reminds me of sparkling grape juice. Definitely not what I had expected, but I think this could grow on me. Definitely a puzzling brew in my book,"
"No is carramellic, litle sour and malty. Taste is even more sour, unbalanced and probably infected. This sourness affects mouthfeel and drinkabillity negativ and makes it for me a poor out! Will try it again to see if this was an incident."
"Pours a dull, orange brown colour with ruby highlights. Thick, bubbly off white head, great retention. Aroma of malt, caramel, toffee, yeast, and some dark fruit. Taste was sweet, malty and fruity. Not much bitterness. Pretty drinkable. Mouthfeel was excellent. Creamy, smooth, moderate body. OK for a dubbel, but not the best."
"The taste was a bit cola-ish, with black cherry and a blueberry tangyness to it, and considerably bitter. Rather soft on the sweet side, which also made it considerably dry. this went ok with the mouthfeel, full bodied and considerably carbonated, very accordingly to the style. All in all a good beer, but i'd stick to the tripel. I like sweet stuff."
"Somewhat clear, brown is the base hue but there are significant influences of gold and amber. There is pretty good color depth but it still seems thin to me, Id like to see it a little darker. The head was beige in color, at the apex the foam was two fingers in height and then it quickly faded to a half finger, foamy cap. This cap had good staying power, it lasted the entire consumption. The subsequent lacing was spotty and it clung poorly. The nose is pleasant in aroma but weak in presentation. Ripe fruits are the strongest aroma, dates, figs, and plums. Spicy brown sugar notes follow, they seem to springboard from the malt base. There is a slight band-aid aroma, some cloves too, with a generic medicinal aroma. Raisins. Cola. Caramel. Overall the potency is moderate but the strongest aromas easily overpower the subtleties. A casual sniff only renders the dark fruit. Simplistic. It is inviting but I have some reluctance. The palate is tasty but unimpressive. The bouquet was simplistic but not as unsophisticated as the taste. There isnt much complexity here, sure I like what I taste but there is nothing to sink my teeth into. There is no body here, where is the malt backbone? I get plenty of dark fruits (rains, dates, figs) and they taste lovely. They really do. Sprinkles of caramel and there is even a dusting of band-aids and clove. The alcohol is very perceptible. Hops do offer some bitterness and a biting twang with an herbal note. As you see this beer has flavor but the proportions dont seem right. More malt is needed. Badly. The finish is a bit too clean; more yeast residue is needed. Ordinary. Its not flawed, just boring. Medium-light in body, the carbonation is big and lively, the mouthfeel is too thin and too effervescent. I thought this beer was merely okay. This is a very average Dubbel. I cant foresee another purchase of this beer. Maybe this would be a good introduction to Belgian beers for the timid. Purchased as part of a sampler-pack in Ames, IA."
"A dark, amber brown body with a huge, booming head. The head drops slowly until it's a chunky spread of foam over the beer. The aroma is rich, lots of lemon, browning bananas, caramel and cream. The flavor is sweet and hides the alcohol well. There's kidn of a candi sugar flavor in there as well."
"This beer produced a huge 3-finger frothy tan head. The color was dark brown and garnet colored. No light was seen through the beer. Hardly any lacing going down. The smell was hoppy, floral with hints of dark cherry. The taste had a slight sourness and was fruity with good malting and slight sweetness like strawberries. The mouthfeel put me off a bit because of too much carbonation and it wasn't as smooth as I would've liked. This was an ok beer."
"Poured into a Rapscallion glass, formed a 1"" tan head over the murky, effervescent reddish brown brew. Head lasts a long time, and laces well, with bits of foam. Aroma is spicy Belgian notes, with a hearty malt base apparent. Taste is somewhat neutral, with light malt flavors, and a tad of the spicing that the nose hinted at. Mouthfeel is creamy and smooth, and the drinkability good as well. Almost seems dumbed down a bit here, but on the upside, perhaps this makes it more approachable for the newer Belgian aficianado."
"Beer is good. Happy beering."
"Drinkability - A very nice sipping beer. Perfect for a winters day. Isn't packed full of taste, but is very pleasent and makes for an enjoyable drink."
"The taste was also dark and fruity with a rather sour aftertaste. Interestingly, the sourness went away as it warmed. Or perhaps I just got used to it. Either way, it definitely improved as I got closer to the bottom of the glass."
"Awesome head retention on this on this one. Poured into a chalice glass. Aroma is creamy, sweet, slightly chocolatey? Taste is smooth, ripe figs, brown sugar, phenols, with a nice crisp slightly fruity finish. Pleasent mouthfeel, full, but perhaps slightly overcarbonated. A nice dubbel, not the best I've had but definitely worth drinking."
"The beer has a very thick feel in the mouth, and is almost creamy. The only qualm I had was that it is a little sweet and heavy so one in a session was enough."
"Taste is very fruity. Sour apple and plum or peach. Tangy and sweet. Lightly metallic. Spicy, like nutmeg and mace. Mouth is crisp and a bit over-carbonated for my liking. Not big at all but smooth with a sweetly sour aftertaste. Very good and very drinkable. Nothing too complex but a tasty dubbel. not a big fan of the style but this would have to be one of my favorites so far."
"Belgian beer night at my flat is quickly becoming Belgian beer week, so let's see what tonight has to offer. Bornem Dubbel pours a dark mahogany with an incredible yellowish head that is laces like there is no tomorrow. Aroma of yeast and fruits, and almost doughy smell (I'm starving, it worked for the monks, maybe it'll work for me). Taste was a subdued tangy fruitiness with a bit of malt and a great creamy finish. Very smooth and the ABV is hardly noticeable. This is a very easy-drinking Dubbel, and I am starting to wonder if this is my favourite style."
"this is one delicious Dubbel. It pours a hazy cherry mahogany with an awesome billowy egg shell colored head. It lasts the entire glass and coats it with a thick foamy layer of lace. The aroma is of dark beery fruits, spices and a nice doughy malt. The flavor is tasty and refreshing. It bursts with citrusy notes (hops? yeast? orange peels? all of these?) and nice caramelly candy sugar, berries, floral hops are also present. The finish is at once tart, sweet, fruity, bitter and spicy, really incredible. The mouthfeel is smooth and creamy. This is one hell of a Dubbel. I tie with Maudite for my favorite of the style."
"I'm just starting to get into Belgian brews, and this offering did not disappoint. It is a sold above avergae brew. Appearance is that or port wine, witha pillowy, ice cream float type head. Smell reminds me of port wine...inviting. Taste initially was a bit disappointing, however, as it warmed improvement was there. Again, wine-like in taste, but very mellow and rounded. Mouthfeel was very, very dry....I like it. The alcohol is there, so drinkability is very good for sipping."
"Overall: Brewed since the early 1970s for the St. Bernardus Abbey of Bornem. It is rumored that the Monks could fast on this Beer for 40 days, so Beer really is Food it seems. Cost $7.99, and well worth it. A solid dependant Dubbel."
"The combination of odd flavors make this a singular experience but also limits the drinkability to the singular as well...."
"This dubbel has left me puzzled. I pondered about trying the Bornem Triple, first, but opted for this one instead. I enjoyed this, with its malty goodness, but it's so atypical for style that I'm wondering if this bottle was heat damaged. Nevertheless, it's tasty enough that I would enjoy another if I had one."
"This S.O.B. gushed like crazy on me and left a big mess on my desk and floor. Has a ruby body and frothy beige head. Prominent nose of bubble gum phenols, esters, dark fruit, honey and a hint of fusel alcohols. Flavor has a slightly sour strawberry quality that I havent detected in other dubbels. Also has a nutty chocolate flavor. Velvety mouthfeel. Pretty good beer. I'm a sucker for this style."
"Pours a nice dark brown amber with a soft tan headskie. Tastes nice and sweetly meaty like a dubbel should. This is one solid brewskie which compaires nicely to other dubbels in this world and also upstages the brewery's own trippel. Sweet, yet malty smooth with feeling. Certainly worth a few gulps, even if you are dead set against enjoying this supurb brew."
"I have not been very impressed with this brewery so far. Perhaps all of these bottles are too old? No born on date to tell."
"The taste is very smooth but lacking a big body and also mouth feel. Sweet with hints of citrus and much malt. A bit ""grassy"". Aftertaste hides the alcohol completely. A solid dubbel."
"Pours a dirty, dark and deep brown. Head is quite incredible, typical for the style, fluffy and heavy, but also reducing itself quickly. Smells sour and fruity, like grapes, almost wine-like. Taste is initially bland, interestingly enough the aftertaste is far more powerful! The aftertaste is strong and sour, and powerfully sweet. Not very drinkable. I wouldnt point to this beer an a typical example of the style, but it is interesting to try."
"The beer pours a cloudy dark brown color with a thick frothy off-white head that slowly fades. The aroma is good. It has a refreshing dark malt scent that is light and fruity. The taste is good. It has a good malty flavor and a refreshing Belgian yeast finish. It goes down easy and has decent mouthfeel. It is a medium bodied beer with a little too much carbonation. This is a good beer; a fine Belgian. The mouthfeel is just a bit much."
"Generally a very drinkable brew- not as complex as some, but makes it easier to just sit back and enjoy. I liked it!"
"This brew is a dark brown, cloudy bodied brew, with a large, light brown colored head. Loads of lace. Scent is of sweet malts. The taste is of smooth malts, sugared candy, some fruit flavors-plum, slight alcohol spice. Mouth is medium bodied, lots of carbonation. Not a bad brew."
"Overall, an enjoyable brew but not one I'd seek out again in the future."
"Drinkability is OK."
"Tastes pretty good though. Full in the mouth. Slighty herbal with loads of dark fruits especially plums and grapes. This is ok."
"Decent, but without being really impressive."
"Medium feel, brought to the light side due to carbonation, a little grainy. Nothing great here, doesn't standup to the top brews in this style, or even the average beers."
"A nice warming brew that serves its purpose here on 12-11-03 in the Windy City. Nothing to rush out and stock up on, but a pleasant trial included in a variety pack offering."
"I had this on tap (I was in need of some warming up, as I had been driving and my car has no heat. Despite popular belief, it does get cold down here on occasion!). Anyways, appearance typical for the style, nice head and retention. Quite sweet, and somewhat limited in flavor. Not the usual hop profile of the best examples of the style. Smooth and creamy, but relatively flat and narrow in scope. It did warm me up for the ride home, and not a bad beer. There are just too many others that blow it away."
"11.2oz. bottle poured into a tulip-style glass. It pours a deep muddy brown with a Duvel-like 4 finger head with awesome head retention. There is lots and lots of lacing left on the glass. The smell is full of sweet malt with chocolate, plums, and dates. Very full aroma. The taste is fairly sweet, a little tart at first with caramel, raisins, and a little nuttiness. A little tart/bitter mix on the finish. The mouthfeel is fairly thick and smooth, and it really has a good drinkability for being 8%. Not a bad Dubbel!"
"Hit of our recent beer tasting. Was very sippable by us. Tasted like a fine wine, with sour fruit on the tongue. Would definately have again with firneds to gauge their reaction. Not smooth but quite unique.. Very nice before dinner despite high alcohol."
"Pours a beautiful deep orange brown that is surprisingly clear. The head is big, puffy, tan, and slow to settle. The lace is good, but not great. The nose is very fruity - plums, grapes and cherries - with some malt. The mouth is very prickly and medium bodied. There is lots of sour fruit in the opening taste - basically cherries and cranberries. The fruit is followed by a nice hop and alcohol kick. The aftertaste is mainly bitter, with some of the fruit remaining. This would be a good dessert beer, but not a good session prospect."
"Coppery brown with a minimally slight yeasty haze to it. Thick tan head in the goblet. Soury malt notes and a decent amount of hop presence, for it's style. Big malt sweetness, mixed with a subtle sourness not unlike the skin from a dark plum. Mostly sweet; then sour. Interesting blend of flavor, though. Silky mouthfeel. I've enjoyed this on draft for a while, but I think I've underestimated the bottle version of this beer a bit."
"Pours with a head that is equal, or more, to it's beer. A nice translucent brown color, with an off white head. Smells of spices and apples. Tastes of alcohol and a little bit of hops and spice. Mouthfeel is a little thick and slippery, but very satisfying. A good all-around beer."
"I like this beer. It is always available."
"Dark burnt sienna color, mult-sizes to the bubbles of the head and a good 1/2 inch of bottle conditioned suds. A lot of apple and peach to the aroma, fruity. In contrast the malt flavor seems to feature a husky nut-like characteristic, dominant and lasting throughout the taste. Yeast and plum components are in here as well, however this beer seems ""tight"" for a Dubbel, a style that can show combinations of chocolate and multiple fruit profiles. Not a killer in complexity, it seems like the bigger Gulden Draake and Piraat have the most challenging interest in the Van Steenberge line -- but they do seem to produce a lot more beers than I've had opportunity to get my hands on."
"Smooth going down....this one will sneak up on you and put you to sleep due to the ABV which is not evident anywhere in this product except the end resultzzz."
"Deep garnet, very dark with huge long lasting head. Head lasts forever, but leaves little lace. Sweet, fruity aroma with a slightly off note to it. Sweet and malty with cherry and raisin flavors. Slightly tart and clean in the finish. Moderate body with good carbonation. Good, but not great"
"This was one of the cleanest, freshest tasting dubbels I've ever had. Differed quite a bit from the other Belgian Dubbels due to it's lack of your typical horse blanket, earthiness yeast flavors. I enjoy those complexities and was surprised that the Bornem was so different. The beer poured a reddish brown with a thick but quickly dissipating head, and exploded with fruit in the nose. My first impression was of sour cherries and grapes. This ale reminded me of a Flemish Sour Ale, more than a dubbel. Refermented in the bottle this may be a much different beer, I've always contended that Belgians on tap tend to be less complex and cleaner than their bottled cousins."
"The head is markedly better than my first review. It is full, came up easy, and showed awesome retention. The carbonation was a little better as well, so Im changing some scores around that will move it up from an overall 3.6 to 3.9."
"Pours deep brown with ruby highlights. It forms a thick chunky head, with good lacing. It has an herbal, fruity aroma like that of dates and raisins. The flavor is medicinal with a light taste of dark fruits. It is light bodied for its strength but easy drinking. Not too bad, but I would not search this one out again."
"Poured a muddy brown color with a huge head that quickly receeded leaving about 1/4"" top.Aroma of malt with some yeast notes.Somewhat bready and earthy.A slight caramel taste in the flavor-as well as a malty sweetness.Slight hop bitterness.Nice full mouthfeel-the 8% alchohol comes thru just a bit.Overall a nice double.Worth a try."
"The Dubbel poured a dirty cloudy brown color with a slight head. As the head subsided, a very strong carbonation became present as bubbles were exploding on the liquid surface. Not sure if this was normal. The aroma was sweet and yeasty, with some floral tones. The flavor was like other Belgian Dubbles, with a sweet maltiness and slight yeast flavors. The difference was this was much crisper and more bubbly in the mouth. The alcohol level of 8% was not as noticeable. The higher carbonation levels dropped the mouthfeel and drinkability categories to a notch below good."
"Pours a dark amber with a full tan head and a little lacing on the glass. The aroma is slightly wheaty, but with some fruits underneath and also some malts are present. It has a medium fullness for body. The taste is a little sweet and there are just enough spices to make it interesting. Taste has a caramel flavor to it and the carbonation stays present in the taste as well. Not a bad beer, but flavor didn't meet my expectations."
"A fairly decent dubbel. Simple with good drinkability and warming effect."
"Pours out the raisiny brown one would expect from a dubbel. Had an enormous head (Must have poured too quickly) that I had to wait quite a while. Smell was sweet bread-like, a malty overtone dominant. Taste was suprisingly uncomplex, something was a bit missing. Overall, a well done beer but the lack of pop in the taste left me wanting for more..."
"Medium brown color, medium head. Aroma is malty, sweet and somewhat nutty. Malts are sweet, its hoppy and slightly spicy. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is very smooth. Aftertaste is slightly bitter. No alcohol bite, despite 8% alcohol. Nice drinkable beer."
"It has a carbonated mouthfeel with a strong grassy wheat feel. It's drinkability is okay. Very well made it just did not stand out for me. I am sure people who seek out this ale will rate it much higher than I did."
"Originally sampled on 13 November 2003. I am writing this review from my notes. This pours a brown color with a good sized head. The flavor has a nice roastiness to it, but it was nothing spectacular. There are better abbey ales to be found, this was just OK"
"Poured a deep dark crimson color with a nice creamy head. The smell was subtle yet powerful, with scents of carmel malt, spices, and alcohol. The taste was smooth and delightful. Initial taste was a nectar-like sweetness with a hint of orange and spice. Alcohol and fruit flavors became apparent in the middle, and the finish was silky smooth perfection that left no harsh aftertaste. A dangerous beer because I could easily drink several of these without realizing it. Another great one from the Van Steenberge family."
"Mine says 11%ABV. Nice creamy lasting head. Aroma is quite yeasty. I got a bit of yeast, some apple juice and some Ribena in the flavour. Relatively dry in the end, texture is quite soft and a bit thin for such a strong beer. A bit average i reckon. Not too bad."
"A hazy chocolate-brown body gently streams with tiny bubbles beneath a full and foamy light-tan head. The retention is excellent and it very slowly drops to a creamy collar and shallow surface covering. With each sip you take it leaves sheets of lace. Unfortunately, the lacing seems to be unable to stick to the glass and slowly slides back into the beer. The bouquet displays a combination of malt and fruit that includes cocoa and caramel (similar to Ovaltine) splashed by gentle, mildly-tart raisins and plums. The body is thin and crisp on the tongue with a very fine and effervescent carbonation that warms in the mouth to become nicely creamy. The flavor initially displays the cocoa and caramel found in the nose, but quickly thins with a lightly acidic and fruity (cherry-like) character. The more yeast that's allowed to enter the glass, the sharper the fruitiness is. As it warms, however, it softens to become more chocolatey and raisin-like. A note of alcohol becomes apparent at the swallow, and it finishes dry with a lingering note of soft, fruity chocolate (similar to chocolate covered raisins). Quite nice! Rich and fairly complex with a good deal of malt and fruit, yet light in the mouth. Very drinkable, and well worth trying."
"As a side note, it gets my vote for scariest bottle. That grotesque Monk is absolutely hideous. WTF is with those eyes? Make it go away..."
"Once again I fell in love with this beer on draft this past summer while quaffing beers at the Yardhouse in Costa Mesa, CA. This is like a friend revisited, this beer pours ruby musky brown slightly hazed with a cream tan head with weak head retention. This is one malty treat wrapped in raisins and a load of perfectly ripened succulent fruit (mainly pears and apples). Flavor profile brings on a vinous grape tone with hints of mildly alcoholic plum brandy. Wonderful underlying richness of fruit tones. God, I love this beer is topped with a candied apple finish. What a smooth mouthfeel the creaminess that this beer produces to the palate is dream like. Wow, high abv but this beer is amazingly balanced in every way, I know I could put more than one down."
"I guess the reviews were correct. Chalk up another one for BA's!"
"Be careful when pourning, lots of tight, light brown foam along with a hazy brick brown color. The smell of toffee/caramel and malt/hop's fill the nose. The taste was of a toasty toffe with layer of malt and hops. A decent beer without being heavy. Well-balanced and nicely put together! But, not on the top of my list!"
"Notes: A bit brash on the palate for my liking, enjoyable but not something I’d hunt for again. It did very well up against the sharp cheddar I paired it with."
"A pretty decent beer, but it seems to be unusual for the style."
"Color's a dark burgundy, with ruby highlights, and huge, billowy, creamy tan head stands above. My superlatives end there, as I encounter one of the simplest ""abbey dubbels"" I've yet encountered. Aroma: small suggestions of nuts, cream, dark fruits(cherry, grapes), little hints of toffee, and there may be elargely to a fault, for there's precious little of the deep complexity we find in favorite dubbels, Ommegang, or Maredsous. Malt is king, here, hops are hidden, blasts of carbonation hit the palate now and again. Finish is, ""okay", there's a minor grainy grit in the texture, but, alas, this is a rather ordinary brew for the style"
"Second in my six pack sampler, was this offering. Agood reddish color, with a good head. A fruity taste, with a good dose of malt. Not overly impressive however, could have used more hops. Not too complex, what I would consider a peasant beer, lucky peasant though."
"Appearance of murky iced tea or apple squeezins. No real head to speak of. Almost has a coca-cola type of carbonation. Big fizzy bubbles that fade fast. Sweet malty aroma, fruity, with a definite caramel bite. Almost smells like chocolate covered raisins. Forget almost, that's exactly what it smells like. A box of raisinettes soaked in alcohol. Tastes of caramel and raisins too. Tart finish. This beer is a nice winter warmer. Just the right body, but a little overcarbonated IMO. Pretty drinkable though."
"This beer poured a nice reddish amber color and formed an light tan bubbly head that left circular lace as it subsided. A medium amount of carbonation was present. An aroma of malt, caramel and cherries. A flavor of malt, caramel and raisins. A touch of the alcohol was present in the finish. A rather interesting flavor for a dubbel."
"Double Bornem has a very fruity flavor (the cherries). Finishes slightly dry with a just a touch of spice and warming alcohol at the end. This is a killer brew. I'm getting more soon."
"Sporting a nose of papaya, pound cake and sour cherries, Bornem pours a well-charged deep amber. Layered sweet malt and tinny hop fight for taste bud supremacy, but are soon overwhelmed by a not so pleasant tang-filled finish riding a wave of alcohol that throws a wrench in the works. Not bad, sturdy and simple."
"On tap at the Yard House in Long Beach CA. It's darker than I remembered it being out of the bottle: brown with a hint of orange. The smell of fruit became more pronounced as it warmed a bit. An assortment of fruit flavors swims around nicely, with notes of plum and cherry. It's definitely a sweet one that rounds out an evening nicely."
"Pours a dark reddish colour topped by a very impressive thick and creamy head. The colour of the head is light brown which adds to the overall appearance of this dubbel. The aroma is sweet and malty. Good carbonation with strong taste and mouthfeel."
"This is a beautiful dubbel. Not as ragingly spicy as Duinen. Not as saturated with maple syrup notes as Ommegang. Dryer than those, it melts in your mouth. Perfectly balanced and a joy to drink."
"A very deep ruby red on the pour, the head is light chocolate in color, creamy, reasonable in size, the lace is chumpy. Nose is malt, nutty sweet, maybe even a bit plum like. Front is delightfully sweet, the top lean, the finish is biting, soothingly hopped, dry somewhat bitter aftertaste."
"A little thin, and a bit disappointing after Van Steenberge's other fine beers.  Still decent."
"Overall, I'd dub Bornem Dubble 'Gulden Draak Jr.'  It has a similar character, but not nearly as rich and complex.  Still very good, however.  And I'd look forward to having it again."
"Bornem Double:  Deep rich copper beer, with a huge head.  Unfortunately the head dissipated in a few minutes, but left a light Belgian Lace.  Malt aroma, with a hint of something metallic.  Fantastic sweet malt taste, with a hint of sourness toward the end.  Perfect for an after dinner drink.  Very nice rich beer."
