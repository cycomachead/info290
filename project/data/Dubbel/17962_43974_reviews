"Pretty unbalanced, actually kind of gross. Whatever. It's different? I guess at least try it once... Kind of tastes like a weird candy your grandmother might give you. It could be your thing! Side note - it really opens up as it warms..."

"Now, lets talk about the branding. It sucks. The packaging at first glance gives the impression of a cider or light beer. The name suggests a genetic abnormality but it is an organic beer. The whole branding is an oxymoron so maybe this is a hipster beer and intended to be ironic? Either way it is worth a try."

"Crazy beer worth a try, especially if you like picking out spices and like the ""Belgian malt liquor"" vibes."

"Uncommon Brewers is right! This is a terribly interesting take on a classic Belgian style. Who knows how the monks would feel about this twist, but I say ""Hear! Hear!"". Though far from an outstanding offering, in many ways Siamese Twin represents all that is great about American craft beer: creativity, innovation, reinterpretation, distinctness. And this one's organic too."
"Thanks, bytemesis (from the other site) for the opportunity"

"Overall - My can was only 7/8th's full which was a little odd. An okay beer a suppose, but a tad watery and a little boring. I expected more flash from all the spices advertised on the can. Can suggests that this beer is made to be aged, will give that a whirl."

"Final Grade: 3.61, a B grade. I've never been a big fan of dubbels, and Siamese Twin Ale hasn't really altered my opinion much. The kaffir lime leaves and lemongrass compensate somewhat, but for the most part this is just too sweet and boozy to be something I want to consume very much of - in fact, this tallboy is probably a little excessive. That being said, it still tastes quite good - and this is an interesting brew that might be worth a look if you're into Belgian/spiced ale hybrids. Still, I'll be happy to stick with Chimay Red the next time I have a dubbel craving. A creative, passable selection for my 500th review on BA: cheers to 500 more!"

"I wouldn't want to keep this as my right hand, but it's not bad at all. A unique adaptation of the style, and it works. The lime and lemongrass add a nice dimension. Worth trying, but I won't seek it out in the future."
""
"First sip is bomb of sweet sugary malts. Molasses and toffee flavors dominate but it is cloyingly sweet. Lime coriander and lemongrass all take a back seat. Credit for trying something out of the ordinary but this misses the mark with me... Too sweet and not refreshing."

"Not my favorite, but still very interesting. Uncommon Brewers does an excellent job of putting interesting twists on old styles. Might grab one more for the cellar an rereview later."

"o: a high quality base dubbel regardless of the unusual additions - the lemongrass and lime are either so well or so lightly used that it's tough to pick them out, but a nice background contributor, expected a gimmick but found a really nice beer"
""
""
"Pours nice and toasted brown with some central light etching. Smells of lime, some sweet syrups, a little bit of belgian yeasts, some coriander, and the lemon grass. Taste is lightly tart, some alcohol, some bitterness, some candy. Medium on full body with hi carb and a semi dry finish. Not a good beer really."

"Yes, this was strong but it never tasted that way while I was enjoying this. While the spice wasn't as present here as in other beers that I've had of this style, a little ginger would have provided a nice kick to this. Regardless, this was a different take on a Dubbel that worked well and was a pleasure to enjoy. It's nice to see the envelope pushed on this and Uncommon did it well, to the point where this may end up being popular enough to prove the Brewer's name to be an oxymoron of sorts."

"This poured out as a hazy brown color. It's got an interesting yellowish colored head. The smell of the beer has some spicy citrus notes. There is some caramel and even some booze on the nose too. The taste of the beer has dark fruit flavor with some caramel in there, as it warms up the flavors become more earthy. The mouthfeel is smooth, interestingly soft carbonation. Dry finish too. Overall this beer is decent. Not my favorite Dubbel."
"O: This is an interesting take on the style although it is not as sweet and complex compared to other dubbels."
"O: Enjoyable with the addition of the Thai spices/herbs but the alcohol is just not well enough hidden for me. Not sure I would get this one again as it deviates a little too much from the traditional Dubbel style for me."
"This beer smells like hairspray. I'm sure there is some very technical term that would impress everyone. But hey. I don't know it. Anyways. This doesnt really work for me. I could have done without it. Unfortunately, that seems to be the theme for this brewery, for me."
"Yep, weird sums up this beer quite well."
"Pours a murky dark brown with a 1 inch foamy orange-tan head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Foamy streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is fairly mild and is of malt, Asian peanut sauce, and some herbal aromas. Taste is of malt, dark fruit, peanuts, and some herbal and citrus flavors. There is a mild spice bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer flavor wise but there are some odd aromas coming from this one."
"An impressive dubbel, in the sense of those New World flunkies having a bit of fun, and, um, innovation with the style. The specified adjuncts add their own subtle intricacies, to a one, and the overall toastiness does well to rein in any overly saccharine tendencies. No booze makes itself known, which is an achievement on its own. Quite enjoyable, and worthy of seeking out another."
"Another can offering from these guys this makes number three with one hit and one miss so far and love the list of added ingredients anyway it pours a hazy copper hue which leaves a two finger head that stays and nice lacing,the smell is belgian candy,aniseed,humbugs,cinamon,nutmeg and herbal hops,the mouthfeel is medium bodied and has tastes of nutmeg,lime leaves,cardomon pods,cinamon,herbal fruity hops and finished with a bittersweet mix of herbs and candi sugar,overall its nice and bittersweet with a belgian/thai flair but as they state its an uncommon brew and not that true to style but would be nice with a spicy asian meal or indian curry cheers."
"some time might make this one even better, I didn't expect much from a Dubbel in a pint can but it worked for me and once again I'm well above the average"
"C-"

""
"Overall rating is quite high. I love that this beer of such high complexity is available in a can."
"D - Very drinkable. Nice balance of dark sweet flavors, spices, and body. I like the lemongrass and the kaffir lime."
""
""
"Wow, what a mouthful of unexpected flavors! This is technically a dubbel, in that it more or less looks like a dubbel--nice ruddy brownish/red color--and is strong like a dubbel. But beyond that, this is an entirely different beast. The nose has recognizable Belgian yeast aromas, but there is a ton of exotic spice in there, as well. The palate is a whole other adventure. The Thai flavors actually work surprisingly well with the Belgian yeast. It's like a ripe, funky, slightly savory tropical fruit salad. Delicious."
""
""
""
"Very rich, syrupy malt dominated palate. Heavily toasted and lightly roasted with just a hint of coffee. There's maybe a hint of something herbal, but I wouldn't be able to tell that there was coriander, lemongrass, or lim leaves in this brew unless told. Fruity and yeasty on the finish and linger. Well integrated abv. heat."
"Poured from a can into my trusty snifter, the appearance was a pale golden color with a moderate head erupting toward the top of the glass. The Belgian notes are the most apparent characteristic in the aroma, which gives an understated impression before the taste. The initial taste is somewhat spicy or peppery with notes of corriander and pleasant lime hints that nibble at the sour taste buds on the tongue. Thankfully, the lime is realistic unlike the lime flavoring in certain macrobrews. All of these unusual traits are set against a malty backbone. The unusual flavors in this beer along with a thinner mouthfeel make this beer an odd impression of the style. Yet the complexity of the flavor creates an enjoyable experience."
""
""
""
"Overall, the beer is quite good, and I was very thankful to find that the strange kaffir lime leaf, lemongrass, and coriander additions worked well with the brew, meshing nicely with the malts and hops and providing new and funky layers of sugar and peppery spice, instead of overwhelming it. Recommended, and excellent light fare for a hot day."
""
"Overall this is an ok Dubbel, not sure if it's something i'd seek out again personally though."
""
"O: Damn impressive. I dug the ""not traditionally canned"" style that they chose to release. I'll keep my eyes on these guys."
""
"o - Overall I wasn't a big fan of this one. I thought the nose was a bit metalic, the taste was a little too sweet, and the body was a little too carbonated. Overall not a great beer and something I wouldn't seek out again or recommend."
""
"DRINKABILITY: This is a sipping beer, not one I'd want for a session beer. Two would be tops for me. While easy to drink and having a good price point, the beer suffered from some deficiencies, not least of which was that it didn't taste much like a dubbel. It's described as ""unique and uncommon," and I'll give them that -- and points for creating an original brew -- but I doubt that I'll buy it again; it just wasn't that outstanding."
"O: Frankly, Belgian Dubbel's have never really been my thing, but I'm always up for exploration. While I appreciate the innovative thinking here, it just didn't really gel for me. There seems to be a clash between the sweet malts, dark fruits and spices that just doesn't sit well in my stomach. Still, this one is quite drinkable thanks to the light carbonation, and at 8.5% ABV you pretty much forget what it tastes like half-way through. I could totally see this beer satisfying a niche market, but I would probably pass over it on my next trip to the store. Cheers!"
"O: It has a good aroma and taste, but its really missing the carbonation to kick this beer up from being ""good"" to ""great."""
"Yeah, I'd say Siamese Twins are indeed pretty uncommon... Anyway, this stuff pours a clear ruby-garnet topped by a half-finger of dusty khaki foam. The nose comprises caramel, toasted rye bread, light lime peel, lemon zest, and a touch of banana. The taste holds notes of caramel, burnt rye bread, light lime zest, lemongrass (hey, for once it's actually in the beer!), clove, light fig, and a bit of banana peel. The fruit and grass combine for an occasionally harsh bitterness that tends to clash with the sweetness enveloping it. Luckily, this doesn't happen all the time. The body is a light medium, with a moderate carbonation and a decidedly drying finish. Overall, an interesting dubbel, that's for sure, but one that's not my bag."
""
""
"Overall I assume this one is just as old as the Baltic Porter which is at least 8 months old and still this banging with carbonation. A very weird beer that I could see buying again."
""
"O: Overall an interesting flavor, odd, yet intriquing, don’t know if I could tackle a four pack at once but definitely has enough head scratching oddity to it to warrant at least a try. Spicy lime flower and herbaceous notes that step outside the box. Good alcohol feel and quite hard to label."
"Drinkability- I thought it was pretty good. I usually don't drink dubbels but still pretty good."
"Overall, not my cup of tea. The weird spices seem to be fighting with the toffee sweetness of the ale as opposed to complementing it. Age might mellow these flavors out and produce quite a unique beer."
""
""
""

"Another new beer for me. It is a belgian dubbel brewed with kaffir limes (didn't get much of that), lemongrass (didn't get much of that either) and coriander - and that was the elusive spice I couldn't pinpoint (which is odd because it is a rather distinguishable scent/flavor)."
"Great to see this in BC. Pours dark brown with a lumpy head. The is dark fruit with some coriander.There is a sweetness to the finish but you can detect the lemongrass in the beer as it warms up. Very drinkable and fairly complex this is a great type of beer to be in a can."
""
"Very smooth beer, reminds me of an aperitif. It's slightly sweet, with very little carbonation (despite the head). There's also a floral fragrance that does NOT come from any hop. Light warming spices like white pepper and chile pepper. There is hop, but only in the swallow, even the aftertaste is malty--lots of caramel. Rich body, like whole milk."
"Low carb, but a definite impact on the tongue from the ingredients. As per the can, this would go great with a curry."
"M: The mouthfeel brings the best of the spices out, lime, lemongrass, and cardamom. The dubbel stands on the opposite end of the spectrum but, very surprisingly, the beer melds the disparate flavors nicely."
""
"I like innovation but the spices they chose did not mix all that well with a Dubbel for me. Too much lime and coriander doesn't mix with the medicinal dark fruit base beer. Drinkable but harsh and not something I'll get again."
""
""
""
""
"O - Not my favorite style and definitely not my favorite example of it. Had higher hopes for this, but the mix of spices and limes in a dubbel really didn't work well for me. Wasn't entirely unpleasant, just a bit too weird for my tastes. I think the lime is an interesting idea, but one that would play better in a lighter style."
""
"Overall a very unusual and interesting take on a Belgian dubbel."
"O - Not my favorite brew. Could easily end in the drain.... :( I really wanted to like this brew."
"16 oz tin from ""Lifesource", Salem. $2.95 Bad pour out of the can.huge uncontrollable light tan head...wait a few minutes.When it semi-calms the beer is a nice havy dark amber. Aromas..nice sicy/toasty,bubblegum and coriander.Pleasing Taste is a little maltier but similar to the aroma..slight lemongrass finish and waming plum pudding alcohol. Nice on the palate..liked the carbonation. Nice beer a bit of a surprise."
"Canned extreme beer, hell yeah! Dark ruby color, lacing is as good as it gets. Mouthwatering aroma, the lime leaves and lemongrass along with the malt sweetness make for one of the best-smelling beers we’ve seen in a long time. Brawny like a Dubbel, with a hint of broth, which quickly moves to showcase spices of lime leaves and lemongrass; coriander plays second fiddle. Tart bite from the spicing melds well with the malt base. Alcohol jumps on the palate with a sooth- ing warmth. There is a lot of unusual flavor not only for a beer, but for the style; however, it really works here. The result is a very interesting and very drinkable beer. Sometimes it pays to go out on a limb."
"16 ounce can, date stamped on can of 06/06/2011 (don't know if that's the canned on or best buy date). Served in a St. Bernardus chalice, the beer pours a cloudy reddish/brown color with almost a half inch tan head. Head retention and lacing are both average. Aroma is sweet and spicy, the brew smells like caramel malt, lime, brown sugar, dark fruit and some lemongrass. It tastes like caramel and bready malt, lemongrass, lime, coriander, herbs, and a bit of dark fruit. There's also a lingering bittersweet finish. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit sticky with moderate carbonation. I think this is an interesting brew, I liked it. It's worth a try."
"I'm pretty disappointed in this beer. I was excited when I found a store selling single cans of it because I was unwilling to buy a 4-pack of it where I normally buy all my beer."
"Unique and ""uncommon"" indeed. I give them credit for an original brew, but this is not something I would choose to buy again."
"admittedly, i'm not a big belgian fan. but I like interesting ingredients... I really wanted to be able to give this one an a+ based on concept alone, but it just falls a bit short. a bit sweet, a bit cloying, a bit muddled, and kind of murky. But still interesting and pretty damn drinkable given everything. I'll probably drink another one or two."
"O: uncommon, yes. Different, yes. Great, not really, more toward good. I would say at a minimum give this a try."
"I dont know, maybe this beer was kept in a hot warehouse for a month, or something went wrong between Santa Cruz and Pennsylvania, but I don't enjoy it. There's an odd grassy (not like hops) caramel taste. There's a hint of the kaffir lime that's added I can pull out of the aftertaste, but that's one of the few bright spots. Frankly this smells a bit like an Indian buffet with the coriander and lemongrass additions. I'm not sure what to make of this beer, but I don't want another can."
"Overall- Ok beer. A little thick and sweet. Not nessasarily my cup of tea. 3.5/5"
"Really, a pretty good beer, it's just out of control, & bludgeons whatever the base beer is into a quaking, unset jelly. Nice effort; I'd rather brewers went too far than made another bland pale or IPA. I'd try another from them."
"Medium body - the alcohol isn't as evident as I expected based on the smell. Good carbonation."
"I could of handled more lime I think. Not enough quality lime beers out there. Don't be shy."
"EDIT: While cleaning out the can I noticed the packaged on sticker on the bottom of the can saying it was packaged on 3/19/2010. This would make it 10 months old tomorrow. Not sure I would have bought it had I noticed that when buying it."
"Overall, this drinks smoothly and tastes pretty good. It isn't something I would want every day, but I would have it again."
"Darker than expected, and very cloudy; a solid brick red-cinnamon, with very little head to speak of. Not particularly nice for a dubbel. The aroma is intriguing, appropriately fruity and tinged with Thai spices; the fusion seems to work, at least in the nose. Lychee sweetness and delicate malty notes of muscovado sugar and honey combine with banana and bubblegum yeast to create a nice foundation for the kaffir lime, lemongrass, and coriander. There is a hint of orange soda in there as well. The flavor is subtle and quite tasty, more Belgian than Thai, but that's probably a good thing; the coriander accentuates the earthy spiciness of the yeast, while the kaffir lime and lemongrass wed nicely to the natural fruity and citric flavors from the hops. A bit thin overall, stronger than it needs to be, and a bit vague - but in general a successful and tasty experiment."
"Medium bodied, creamy, mid level carbonation, a little dryness. Pretty smooth drinking, and the flavors all seem to work fairly well despite my initial skepticism, although it was a little sweet towards the end. This is definitely an uncommon beer."
"Roughly medium bodied beer hid its alcohol nicely to make the beer nicely drinkable."
"D - really damn good beer and not a trace of alcohol. The only thing that might prevent me from having more than one or two in a row is the fruity sweetness - it may get to be too much. However, the one (and only) I have is going to be very much enjoyed."
"Poured from a 16 oz can into my Zatec fluted glass. Light brown/amber color with about 3 fingers of foamy, light brown, very quickly dissipating head. Smells like Belgian yeast, maybe some spice and chocolate. Taste, and here's where it gets weird, definitely a sourish lemony something, spice, a medium light hop bitterness, and I don't know what. I guess probably the Kaffir lime puckering my mouth. Nice light crisp bubbles. Very drinkable for 8.5%, but then, I don't think I could drink another. I very much like how different this is, but I don't know if I actually like it. Get back to you on that one."
"This was an interesting beer, but for me the flavors just did not work all that well together. Probably not something I would seek out again, but glad I was able to try it."
"D: Hmmm...I'm a fan of 'curious' beers, ones where brewers push boundaries and craft originality in whatever they brew. This one has successes and shortcomings; while I think the introduction of Asian ingredients is an intriguing concept, they twist the dubbel that I know and enjoy in a way that I don't think I need to have again. A try or two is fine, but ultimately I'm not sold on the repeated drinkability of this experiment."
"Uncommon? Oh hell yeah. Just not as enjoyable as I'd hoped. But it did start growing on me, and with warming things began coalescing a little better. Still, every now and then my palate was rocked by the odd ingredients, just as I was starting to decipher and ""feel"" the dubbel-ness of this thing. Ultimately, even though I might never crave another, it's hard to dislike when I know I'll remember the flavor forever...there's no other beer out there like this one, as far as I know."
"Edit 2/19/13: Had this again, not sure why it's listed here as Dubbel, but whatevs. I found the blend of flavors and spices here to really be a weird mess. The body had a sharp, harsh bite at the back. It wasn't an easy beer to drink, I suggest avoiding this one."
"A gift from my friend Marty. Another canned beer, and one that I had never heard of. Pouring this one into a pint glass results in a cloudy orange-brown pour, with merely a suggestion of light tan foam. An interesting nose on this one, though not unexpected after reading the can; lemon, lime, Belgian spices. On the palate, I get a little of that citrus, along with yeast, bready malt and some caramel. A unique and interesting beer."
"D: refreshing yes, but not the most drinkable beer due to the strong flavors and syrupy finish. I would drink it again if I wanted a nice flavorful hot weather sipper."
"Taste of strong belgian yeast, Lime is pretty strong on a level by itself. I would say Kaffir lime is strangely similar to a chemical lime I have tasted in the past although just entirely coincidental. Medium to thick mouthfeel with a relatively light carbonation. Coriander and Lemongrass also make this a little bit of a sipper. The flavors go together well and would probably be tasty even on a hot day although I usually do not think of a Dubbel as a brew I would be sipping out on a beach etc. Maybe I should?"
"The beer pours an orange color with a white head. The aroma is lemon and lime with some sugar and alcohol. The flavor is lime with caramel malt, lemon and some sweeter dark fruit. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. A nice twist on a dubbel."
"While I can't really say that this absolutley worked for me, I do have to give props on the innovative angle these guys took on a Belgian-Style Dubbel. Just a bit too much going on with the spices here and I wish that this had held the alcohol in check just a bit more as well. I will say that this does make me interested in trying some more offerings from these guys. Uncommon indeed..."
"D - One per session is enough for me!"
"Drinkability: The mouthfeel is good but the flavor profile and the abv hold this one back a bit for me."
"D: Just okay too much going on. Everything seems to be a bit in excess. Too much lime, too much spice, too much booze in the finish."
"Ehh....not the most memorable beer I've had. The overall flavor isn't doing the trick, and it seems a little thin and overspiced in the mouth. Maybe dubbels aren't ideal to have added spices?"
"D: I'm not entirely sure what to make of this beer. The brewers have certainly lived up to their moniker (Uncommon), and it's an interesting twist on a classic style."
"Notes: I really liked this beer. Unique but not strange and very, very drinkable."
"You have to love the fact that this beer is so outside the box on packaging and complexity, but manages to be a solid beer and a classic representation of the style in the end. It poured flat, but no worries, kind of like a hand pump, the beer shows it's true flavors. Taste was rustic and sweet, mouthfeel was smooth and not overpowering. Drinkability-wise, I would recommend this and say you could get into some serious trouble sipping on these at a Raider tailgate, smooth and high-booze, bad combo but very good."
"Have to break this head up so I can taste it. Beer has a slight metallic taste to it. Overall the beer is sweet and has nice malt character. has the nice Belgian yeast spiciness that is associated with Belgian ales. Second taste, I can taste the alcohol in this beer, that's unfortunate. Beer is a little thin, no real bitterness, drinkability moderate (hurt by alcohol flavor). Its a decent beer."
"Siamese Twin Ale is a fascinating and uncommonly delicious ale that adheres to the Belgian brewing tradition of adding all sorts of interesting ingredients to beer. It works out well in the end, which is the only thing that matters. I'd love to lay my hands on some more canned goods from Uncommon Brewers."
"D: I'm not quick to write these guys off, because they obviously have some mad scientist tendencies that could pay off with some excellent beers down the line. This just isn't their magnum opus yet."
"D: Interesting and not as weird as it sounds like. But still, it's a bit edgy and unbalanced."
"Perhaps this is the result of poor quality control (next time I'm in Santa Cruz, I'd like to see how this does on-tap at which point I'll re-review), but this sample may as well have been chugged straight from the can."
"Lightly sweet citrus at the very front, then an intesifying fruitiness with apples and raisins comes along and intensifies, leading to a quite spicy Belgian yeast redux. Long spicy finish ends with a bit of earth. Tropical twist on the fruitiness of a dubbel, and surprisingly spicy. In general, the kind of beer I would refer to as ""interesting"" though probably would not go for again. Lightly bodied with a very big dose of carbon dioxide, much too much of it. Enough to damage the score."
"Overall: Very impressed. So drinkable for a dubbel and 8.5% alc. I originally tried this beer a year or so when it first came out in the area. Wasn't too impressed, seemed a little funky, spicy, unrefined at the time. Heard it had changed a bit since conception, so decided to give it another go and rate it. Unbelievably good. A lot going on. Santa Cruz is known for surf, hippies, and liberals but the microbrewery dept. has been lacking. I predict these guys will change that if they keep moving in this direction. I also hope they will start putting out more cans of their lineup, as this is the only one I think they are canning at this point. A couple other choices locally on tap, but that's about it at this point. Look out for these fella's."
"Bought a can of this in Berkeley recently at Ledgers. This is much better than I thought it was going to be. The can gives the impression that it's going to be a cheap lager- bud light lime clone in particular with the prominently displayed lime on the front and the gaudy silver and green colors. Of course its really a Belgian Dubbel that is surprisingly and delightfully spiced with Kaffir lime, lemongrass, and coriander. The spicing is aggressive and the lime is noticeable but restrained enough to work. Pours a sort of murky dark amber with a fair head and no lacing. The smell is heavier on the lime and lighter on the spices while the taste is the other way around. The sweetness and richness of a respectable dubbel blends well with the Thai flavors. Not only would this go well with curry, it tastes a little curried itself. Surprisingly delightful, and not just a gimmick- change your packaging to reflect the seriousness of your endeavor."
"Siamese Twin is truly an ""uncommon"" beer and that is what makes it so great. I truly wish I had a few more of these as I am absolutely loving it."
"Beach/Shore: This or Ten Fidy? Each are going to do some damage, but here you have a fighting chance, plus the taste is probably going to have a wider appeal than a RIS. I still say that Mama's Little Yella Pils is the best CANdidate, but this could certainly be afforded some cooler space. Best case scenario - my cousin CANs Sculpin and you blend the two in a recyclable cup. The tropical flavors might be enough to give you an apoplectic fit."
"Can thanks to Naven. Pours a murky brown with a thick light tan head. Aroma of Belgian yeast, sweet malt, light fruits (apple, fig), and light spices. Flavor is sweet (sweet fruits, lemon) and yeasty initially with some spices in the finish. Sweet, but drinkable and tasty."
"D: With flavors this bold, I couldn't see myself throwing back more than a couple of these."
"Despite the flavor oddity, it's certainly tasty enough to finish a glass with no issues."
"Drinkability is crazy, combining the amazing taste and the alcohol level. This one could make a fool out of any BA. I wish I had more, this is brewery will rock the industry."
"This is just a little to weird to really be all that drinkable."
"D: You know, when I read that this was an Asian inspired Dubbel, I didn't know what to think. After sampling it, I have to say it works. The flavors are really big and that does take away from the drinkability to me because it really weighs on the palate. With that said, its still an enjoyable brew and there is very little wrong with it IMO. The flavors are interesting and enjoyable. Sure the aroma is a bit weak and the flavors can be a bit heavy, but screw it. Damn impressive take on the style and a hell of impressive brew coming out of that can. Hell yeah!"
"D - After hearing a lot about these brewers, I am a bit disappointed."
"On tap at The Red in Santa Cruz. Deep red-amber with a modest, creamy looking head. The aroma is sweet with light acidic notes and some spice. The flavor is quite malty like caramel and cookies, moderately sweet with less spice than the aroma, and a pronounced lime aspect coming in towards the end. Medium bodied with moderate carbonation. A richly flavored dubbel, although quite drinkable. It is a bit on the sweet side, and the lime is definitely a starring flavor component. I think that these guys have succeeded in being exactly what they claim to be: uncommon. That being said, this one is a bit more on the interesting side than the awesome side, but I would gladly have another when this becomes more available. 3.5 rerate: Canned. Less head, more alcohol, less lime. Still uncommon. this might not be what you think of when you think abbey dubbel, but it goes really well with foods that have a lot of flavors going on. The lime wasn*t overpowering like the draught pint i had a few months back, but it still gives a nice complexity along with the lemongrass and coriander."
"I really like this. Reminiscent of a saison from the spicey and yeasty qualites but with the malt backing of a dubbel. Some caramel deep in the middle before the finish with earthy spicey components, nice hop bitterness. More corriander and clove, lemon, lime other citrus flavors. Very Nice and appetizing."
"D: An unique tasting brew from Uncommon. The 2 beers I've had from them have really been like nothing I've ever had. A weird and enjoyable take on the dubbel, pick it up."
"Drinkability- Not too bad. The smell is really nice and very interesting although it's not very Belgium. The taste however isn't as spicy and much more Belgium like. Granted it does open some as it warms. Overall very interesting and I did enjoy it. Thanks Tim!!"
"Drinkability is ok. Unique is an understatement when describing this beer. It's very odd, yet strangely refreshing. I'm glad I got to try it, but I'm not sure if I'd go out of my way to have it again."
"Overall, not a bad beer, especially at 10 bucks for 4 16oz cans, but not my favorite. Probably won't buy another 4pk."
"D - 8.5 is dangerous but I like this beer."
"""What we have here is a hoppy Belgian dubbel with Thai spices ... especially coriander," said Nor Cal Bobby Java, without even looking at the can. This tasty treat disappeared from my glass before I could take further notes, always a good sign."
"16 ounce can from Ledger's in Berkeley, poured into a pint glass, color is a golden amber color, 3/4 inch foamy white head that leaves lacing on the top of the glass, decent retention, smell was all over the place with lemongrass, raisins, coriander, bubble gum, lime, and booze, flavor starts off slightly spicy, some grassy accents mixed with fruit in the middle, finish has some dark fruit and a syrupy alcohol bite, Belgian yeast is overpowered by the bready malt once it warms, slightly sweet, spicy, chewy, and fruity mouthfeel, medium bodied on the fuller side, taste lingers, needs more carbonation, could not drink more than this serving as I barely got through this, heavy on the stomach, thickness got to me after a while, booze are not hidden either, first beer from this brewery, one of the weirdest dubbels I have ever tasted, not in a rush to drink this again, might be worth trying"
"Drinkability- Not sure if this is a Dubbel. I would lean more towards a Belgian Strong Pale, but at any rate, it is quite different than the rest and worth a try."
"Glad I got to try this - although it's kind of weird drinking Belgian styles from a can. It's definitely Uncommon, and more successful than a lot of other ""crazy"" beer experiments (*cough* DFH *cough*). The organic certification combines with the high ABV to give me a warm feeling inside."
"Pours light hazy brown with a giant creme colored head. Smells of Lemon, Limes, Bananas, Coriander, and Crystal Malt. Tastes the same but with Chocolate. Nice Citrus finish. Very original and interesting. I'm not a huge fan of Coriander, but I'd still definitely recommend this."
"Poured a medium and cloudy amber color with a small sized off white head. Aromas of gerneral herbalness, lemongrass, some spices, and limes. Tastes of the same but the herbalness wasnt as strong and some citrus too. I wasn't getting the normal profile I would expect in a dubbel."
"This is an exciting, uncommon beer from Uncommon Brewers, certified organic, with locally sourced ingredients from the Santa Cruz, CA area. I look forward to more innovations from this brewer."
"The taste is very nice, very interesting, with caramelly fruit-whole wheat bread, citrus, rum, spices and raisiny spiciness. It's sweet, zesty, and a bit spicey, but very smooth, with the alcohol warming and not harsh or overpowering. It has a definite abbey/dubbel character, but with a lot of flavour and s lightly different quality to it. It's very nice with quite a lot of flavour. My main complaint is that alone it is a bit too sweet although they suggest pairing it with SE Asian food and I can see how this would work really well."
"Pours a dark cloudy copper brown. Thin off white head that disappears quickly. A whiff of malt and no hops in the aroma. Taste is unique-a very very candy sugar sweetness coats your tongue, and you can really get the lemongrass and Thai spices when you taste this beer-and this for me is the saving grace of this beer ad sets it apart from other doubles-however, I find it difficult to drink an entire can because it is so sweet. Mouthfeel is medium and drinkability medium-I like this beer but I wish it were more drinkable."
"Overall a nice, creative dubbel that has helped to partially restore my faith in the ability of a Santa Cruz brewery to produce good beer."
"On tap at Mission Pizza in Fremont. Served in a chilled pint glass. Great lookin' beer. Amber with a nice sandy colored head which left some impressive lacework down the glass. Aroma is somewhat muted but I'm picking up a little malt, a little banana. Wonderful flavor...big malt, nutty, grainy, nuances of raisin and banana. Medium to full bodied with a smooth mouthfeel. Very well done. Tastes a little stronger than the 8.5 listed here. I would definitely recommend this."
