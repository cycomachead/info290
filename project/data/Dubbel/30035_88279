Aroma is malty with notes of grape,  dried apple, honey, spice, earthy/floral hops, Belgian funk & a vinous hint. There is little of the dark fruit character I associate with the style. Taste is Belgian malt, sugary dark bread, fig, raisins, soured fruit, a hint of honey, brown sugar, grass, earth, alcohol & a little Belgian funk finishing with pepper & spice. Aftertaste is malty, earthy & bittersweet with an alcohol prominence that fades to a faint bitter astringency. Again little of the dark fruit character I associate with the style. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with lively carbonation, spicy, crisp & dry late in the sip.","mothmanscott","Feb 14, 2015"

Given the beers are a byproduct of another process, and the consumption of them donates not to crass commercialism but to worship and self sacrifice, I tend to enjoy the beers more than just because of their flavor. If this was just another beer, I doubt I would revisit it. As it is a Trappist beer, I'll gladly get another when I get the chance.","HardTarget","Jan 27, 2015"

Very nice balance and complexity of malt, honey, fruity/spicy yeast flavors; with a crisp malt/spiciness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a lightly slick, crisp, and moderately prickly mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish.

Aroma of caramel malt, sweet stone fruit, coriander, Belgian and lighter saison style yeast. Flavor is semi-dry bready malt, saison yeast, light citrus, earthy and bitter spicing. Dry bread crust finish with residual bitterness that tastes more like dry earthy spices than hops. Medium bodied with peppery carbonation. A nice example of a Belgian style farmhouse ale, with both dry saison components and Belgian spicing. The honey element is not noticeable in the taste, but may contribute to the fact that this isn't a very dry ale. The earthy spicing is unusual and rewarding.","LiquidAmber","Oct 05, 2013"

3.53,-5.9,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Pours a murky honey orange with a foamy orange-white head that settles to a small cap on top of the beer. Foamy swaths of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, spice, yeast, and slight fruity aromas. Taste is much the same with spice and yeast flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of spice bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer with some solid aromas and flavors for the style.","UCLABrewN84","Jun 25, 2013"

The aftertaste has some of that cherry show up again, a bit flowery, but it leans to the bitter. Full bodied with a low carbonation level.","smcolw","Jun 07, 2013"

The head sticks around for a while and retains well throughout consumption. The beer smells like lemon, Belgian yeast funk, sweet and bready malt, and coriander. The beer has a nice malt profile that's evidenced in the taste, being nice and bready with some sweetness. I get the lemon and coriander as well as some earthy hop bitterness in the back end. The body is medium with lively carbonation. The finish is dry and the aftertaste coats the mouth. This is a nice drinking beer. This is an excellent beer.","acevenom","Apr 08, 2013"

4,6.7,4,4,4,4,4,"Pours amber with golden highlights capped by a fluffy white head. Great retention and plenty of lacing along the sides of the glass. Plenty of yeast, on the nose, however different and not as strong as the the saison/farmhouse yeast found in most saisons. The honey does come through as well as hay, and some malt touched by a bit of toffee. Yeasty, caramel, honey maltiness, a light touch of citrus throughout. Smooth mouthfeel, light, medium bodied with moderate to low carbonation-much lower than most saisons I've had. A very interesting and enjoyable beer. Well worth a try.","chanokokoro","Jan 20, 2013"
