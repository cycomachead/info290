"Overall: Textbook example of the style (dubbel/BSD) and it’s easy to see why it would rise to the top of the list.  Well built across the board with excellent interplay between bubblegum sweetness, spice, and bready malts.  What makes this beer stick out to me is the toasty, bready malt finish with the residual sweetness of cherries and chocolate.  It also helps that the beer is not too sweet like others in the style.  I made the mistake of serving this too cool at 50 degrees.  Serve just slightly chilled instead."
"So, hm, what to say. I've gotten to the point where I don't really dig malt bombs without something else to keep my interest. This is a good beer, obviously, but it just doesn't have anything to balance out the sweet maltiness and that isn't my thing."

"o: A good drinkable Belgian dubbel with an unique flavor profile.  However, not as enjoyable as anticipated given that I have previously tried both 8 and 10."

"Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Pours a hazy medium to dark bronze amber with a healthy three finger off-white head with great retention and lots of pillowly lacing. Spicy aroma of light stone fruit, dates, raisins, light nuts, cherry; the clove and earthy spices really dominate this more than other Rochefort ales. Flavor is sweet dates, figs, apricot with rapidly developing spiciness of clove and other earthy spices, finisihing with concentrated fruit, caramel and light hops. Really complex flavor. Nice creamy, medium heavy body. An exceptional Belgian ale and possibly the richest, most complex dubbel I've had. I wondered why I never had reviewed this, and it's possible that I always went for its bigger brothers, 8 and 10. If so, my loss. This is as flavorful and interesting as those ales. An exceptional dubbel from one of the best breweries in the world. A total pleasure to drink."

"Beautiful tawny hue with a thin white head, this beer is gorgeous. It shows signs of moderate carbonation and the lacing left on the glass is wonderful. Rochefort 6's aroma is reminiscent of black cherry, cognac, red wine, and plum. The flavor dances on one's palate with a splash of sweetness and a soft, bready foundation. Belgian yeast, nuts, and molasses all come through nicely. It feels relatively light as it coats the mouth, and the finish is satisfying. Overall, this is a top choice to serve to guests with hors d' oeuvres that have discerning tastes."

"La Trappístes Rochefort es sofisticada. Dubbel de sabor magro con un toque de sustentabilidad de abadía belga."

"Pours a pretty deep ruby-amber in color with a good 1+ finger creamy off-white head that settles down to a good 1-2mm layer on top but mostly around the sides of the glass. Some thick layers of lacing is seen that slips back down the glass after the sip (this is a SIPPING brew and not a chugging type.) LOTS going on with the aroma and what I can pick out is spice, dark fruits, sweet malts, and bread. Pretty much the same for the taste with even more going on which I can't really figure out. Very tasty and actually gets better while warming up some. Smooth with a slight sweet finish. Medium+-bodied with perfect carbonation. A pricey brew BUT if you want a great quality brew for this style, then this is it. It's a '10' and is as good as it gets. PROSIT!"

"Possibly got faulty bottles."
""

"O: a very satisfying and appealing beer, a complement to the style in a very positive way, honestly i feel as though the complexity here could be a bit more manifest and the beer itself could be a little more rich and dark but overall an outstanding beer"
""
"33cl bottle from Firefly locally. Chilled slightly, opened to a fountain of foam. Poured it full on into a chalice. Head dissipated rapidly, slight lacing left behind. Great Malty upfront taste, with sugar and candy high notes. It flattened out fast and carbonation was gone, maybe a slightly older batch,. Quaffed quickly, will try again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, I think this beer could benefit from softer carbonation.  It's a classic beer that's been made the same way for ages so perhaps it's just not my cup of tea.  Nothing was wrong flavor-wise and it actually paired nicely with some pierogies and spinach and feta chicken sausage."

"It is not the 8 or the 10 but an outstanding beer.  Very easy to drink, it went down very quick.  As my beer guru said, if he were a rich man this would be a great beer to drink in quantity.  Overall that is the biggest drawback, great beer but maybe not great enough for the cost."

"Rochefort 6 pours a darker cloudy amber color, with a very large frothy and lacing head.  There is a sweet toasted aroma, some notes of Belgian candies.  The taste is much the same, toasted, but bigger notes of sweet candy.  Good body and good feel.  Overall its complex and well constructed, a little too sweet for me."

"DATE REVIEWED: August 3, 2014... GLASSWARE: Chimay chalice... OCCASION: great PSU weekend comes to a close...APPEARANCE: dark brownish red body that pours with a sizzle, then opaquely feigns daylight; off-white single-finger hand is bubbly with cream head... AROMA: plum, banana, some iron and blood rust; yeasts make the aroma slightly funky; rather faint for a Trappist... PALATE: surprisingly thin, but with as unsurprisingly long, warm aftertaste; creamy and extremely drinkable... TASTE: raisins mix with woody, smoky water notes; sugars mingle for sweetness; rather understated for a Trappist, again, but still chewable and rewarding slow sips...OVERALL: expectations were for something bigger; this eased off its intensity and actually proved elusive on its profile; good, but also worth its price if on sale...."

"Overall - very good dubbel with absolutely wonderful aromatics. The rest of the beer was a bit of a letdown, but that's only when comparing with the magical 10 and 8. Still one of the best dubbels on the market and a must try for Belgian lovers."

"330 ml. bottle, served in chalice glass (I can't find my Rochefort one). Red copper colour, with a small head that fades soon, leaving a minimal lace. Smell of chocolate, cherries, ripened fruits, port wine. Palate is just a pleasure, not much carbonation, just go round your tongue like a nectar. Taste is like the smell: cherries, chocolate, port wine, dark and ripened fruits, caramel. Glory."
""
"Overall, a really nice Belgian Ale and one of the standards. While the complexity is a bit lacking compared to the quads, this beer holds its own with the other Dubbels out there and is a treat to drink."
""
"O- Overall it tastes closer to an Achel Brown than a Rochefort 8 or 10. Does not have the same quality feeling about it either. For such a strong malty taste I would have expected more taste, still an enjoyable beer but not the best for me."
""
""
""
""
"That said, the beer feels light, and the 7.5% ABV is masked superbly. So, it's surprisingly drinkable, given its taste profile."

"Final Grade: 4.52, an A. Rochefort 6 is one of the most satisfying dubbels I have ever had the pleasure of quaffing. Honestly, if you like Belgian beers, you would be doing yourself a disservice by avoiding this - and I'll just leave it at that. A must try."
"Chestnut brown in color; opaque. Huge foamy head when poured, though it dies down quickly, Nice smell - slightly sweet with hints of grain. Delicious taste; slightly sweet and mild taste of grain. Medium body; not too heavy yet not thin. Nice mild carbonation. Pleasant to drink! Very nice Belgium Trappist beer."

""
"Brown body with foamy white head that stays around. Yeasty aroma of cherries, caramel, herbal notes, and mild booze. Flavors evolve through caramel, herbal, medicinal, boozy counterparts, and a sweet cherry liquor. Wonderfully balanced. Medium body with light carbonation. Sweet and cloying."

"O - I must say I was expecting more body and complexity (I must have been spoiled by Rochefort 8 and 10). However, this beer really opens up with subtle hints of different spices and develops a wine-like feel. I liked it, though I must say it probably is not the place to start if you are not very familiar with Belgian ales."
""
""
"Light sweet aroma of caramel with a hint of warm alcohol amd just a touch of dark, burnt sugar. Light body, very highly carbonated. Light, hazy brown. Sweet, light caramel flavor with some alcohol warmth, a hint of dark, slightly burnt sugar and a hint of earthy hops. I think the bottle may have been fairly old."

"A mais abaixo da média de todas as Rochefort, porém uma grande cerveja, agradável e uma boa representante do estilo. Não se trata das mais admiradas cervejas, mas compõe bem a respeitada trilogia Rochefort. Vida longa a Abadia Notre-Dame de Saint-Rémy."
"The lightest and ""smallest"" of the Rochefort beers, perhaps one of the best series of beers in the world. Poured from a red-capped bottle into a Chimay goblet ... Hey, according to Stan Hieronymus in ""Brew Like A Monk", Chimay did influence Rochefort's recipes and provide much needed technical support at a time when Rochefort needed important quality control. I won't make claims about who ultimately does a better job at the present time but I will say that the beers are decidedly different and leave it at that. Rochefort 6 is an interesting reddish brown color, not opaque and quite bubbly. Reminds one of autumn leaves when one is in a whimsical mood I suppose. Quite aggressive carbonation during the pour and this carries over onto the palate yet remains pleasant. Aroma is herbal and earthy in equal measure, only a little sweet, with a tinge of root cellar and yeasty funk. Body is quite thin and the beer comes across as smooth, ""digestible", and easy to drink, albeit with a complex and rather unique flavor that belies the notion that this should be chugged. Perfumed like some types of black tea, evokes little in the way of dried dark fruit but does deliver some earthy, herbal spice that recalls ginseng root, cassia bark, and perhaps a bitter cola, with a very mellow chocolate vibe (carob?) as the backbone along with some butterscotch and a subtle nutty character. Booze is detectable but far from overpowering. Not appreciably sweet but my brain does conjure up images of light powdered sugar. Unique! Dry, herbal, with an earthy spicy bitterness that one does not soon forget."
"Good, rich, abbey style beer."
""
""
"Overall 3.75: It's amazing to me how so many elements of the taste sensation of beer can be accentuated or de-accentuated...so much so in either way that it becomes a distraction. In the case of this beer, the bubbles are out of control and dominate way too much of the taste sensations. A shame: this beer has many unique and appealing characteristics, but they are all overshadowed by that one thing that we take for granted with beer; carbonation."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O. Wonderful combination of flavors, that has a surprising finish. Special occasion beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured from a brown 11.2 oz. bottle. Has a very dark bronze color with a 1/2 inch head. Lots of carbonation. Smell is of dark fruits, malts. Taste is yeast, fruits, spices, malts, some alcohol. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall, while I wasn't blown away by it, is a solid beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I think the aging has really improved this beer, not that I don't like it when it's new. This has a delightful sourness to it, as well as a very pronounce fruit cake kind of taste. The yeast really blends nicely with all of the other flavors. This was just delightful, I wish I had more."
""
""
"Foggy ruddy brown with a quickly dissipating, loosely bubbly head. Rich aromas of malt and fruit: sticky brown bread, warm nuts, figs, bananas, berries, and flowers. Super well-rounded malty flavor. Figs, raisins, caramel, spices, berries, and sweetened tea. Quite highly carbonated, prickly on the tongue, and dry through the finish. Very tasty and (obviously, perhaps) the easiest drinker of the Rochefort trio. The balance and interplay of soft, malty flavors is terrific."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a good dubbel. On par or slightly below the Westmalle Dubbel I think."
"Largely overshadowed by its bigger brothers, Rochefort 6 is a good dubbel but falls short of other top examples like Westmalle's and Ommegang's."
""
"Pours out a nice dark brown in color with a small beige head with little retention. Smell is of brown sugar, raisins and other dark fruits. Certainly smell nice Belgian yeast with quite a bit of sweetness. Taste is much like the nose. There is certainly some nice Belgian candy sugar with the dark fruits. Really a nice beer. Mouthfeel is thin to a little thick which really suits the style. Belgians are some of my favorite beers and this doesn't EVER disappoint."
""
"I would definitely buy this again and recommend to friends. I hope I can find the 8 and the 10 as well."
""
""
""
" A true classic for the style."

"330 ml bottle. Pours amber with creamy, long lasting white head. Aroma is of funky yeast, bready malt hints of plums, cherry and grassy hops. Body is full and crisp. Taste is of bready malt, spicy yeast, plums, cherry, drying alcohol and herbal hops. Finish is long spicy and dry. Wonderful, complex brew, but a little bit too spicy for me."
"O. Decent beer but not worth the $5.49 I paid for a single. Looking forward to trying the 8 and 10's I have staring at me."
""
"O: to my pure side, this is missing a little more dry bitterness, but really more to the style is a nice, smooth, easy drinking beer. Classic offering that can be enjoyed and allow the taste buds to savor rather than survive"

""

"Overall, I enjoyed this beer with some salty peanuts and fresh kettle corn. I would buy this again. I just would have liked more aroma. Cheers to the monks!"

"Having had 10 and 8, this feels quite like a different animal. 8 is much more fruity and spicy, whereas this has that drying drinkability. A really nice brew."
""
""
""
""
"O - I was underwhelmed by this beer. The aroma was promising with lots of fruits and classic belgian sugars, but the flavor was weak and lacked complexity. Admittedly this isn't a style I usually enjoy, but I won't be getting this again."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I'm not a huge fan of dubbels, I generally find them to be oddly bland. This has that same bland character but it's got enough complexity and flavor to rise above. Possibly my favorite dubbel in fact."
""
""
""
"No data on the bottle date."
"Very refreshing for 7,50 ABV, it has copper colour and rich, long lasting white head. Smell and taste of caramel, cloves, candy sugar, oranges and apricots. Very light for a dubbel, but I wouldn't say watery. Nice beer. I would love to try it with food. (Someone said lamb stew with carrots and risotto with fungi would go great with this one.)"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Atmosphere is pretty solid. Sizable frothy head, and a slight beer ring. Woody with some tea, and butterscotch. Woody malt with plenty of butterscotch and a little bittersweet licorice. Earthy and hearty. Overall, this is a good quaff."
""
""
""
"Now for the 8 and 10."
""
""
"O/D-Not really in my wheelhouse. Too sweet. Heats up the cheeks. Always worth trying the classics but I didn't really like this too much."
"Delicious brew! I love Belgian ales and this one did not disappoint! Very dark appearance some good head and fruity flavors made it quite delightful serving in a goblet. I need to try the other Rochefort Trappiste ales like number 8 and 10 for comparison."

"Remarks: Did not score A, T, S, M at that time; disregard those scores"
"Definitely not my favorite in their line (8 and 10 being a couple of my all time favorite beers), but still very good. No alcohol presence detected, and very easy drinking. A warming delight."
"Overall: A beer that kind of slips through your fingers in a good way. Very complex with flavors and aromas that present themselves then dissipate quickly"
"Overall (4.5/5): Rochefort 6 does the name proud. This is one of the best dubbels I've ever had–tons of character, subtle and complex, beautiful to look at and a joy to have slide over the tongue and down the hatch. The 6 puts together the classic components of Belgian Dark Ales–brown sugar and dark fruit flavors, creamy mouthfeel, and a complex yeasty spiciness–in a way that distinguishes it from others. My guess is the house yeast used by Rochefort. Bottom line: excellent beer. Don't die before having one."
"O: A far above average beer, but I'd still classify it as really good, not excellent."
""
""
"This brew is savory. It has a peppery smell and taste that is warming. Interestingly, the alcoholic smell calms a bit as the drink warms. Sadly, the drink continues to mellow and almost takes on a watery taste as the cold leaves it. Don't get me wrong, this is a great drink. However, it's one of the few that I've enjoyed more when it was colder. I would probably get this again...well, I would probably get the 8 or the 10 before this any day."

"Buckeye is right (no shock there) in that this is a lighter example of the style (no figs), but very well done for that."

"If you're not ready to dive in with bigger beers like Westy 12, Chimay Blue, and the like, this is a good starting point. I was able to buy this doll for less than $6 at my local bottle shop. Absolutely worth checking out if you're curious about genuine Trappist ale."

"This is an excellent beer, the appearance is probably the low point just because it is so murky, not to mention the yeast on the bottom came right off and most of it ended up in the glass. The biscuit and bread go well with the raisin and rum that start to show as the beer warms."

""
""

"Overall: Didn't quite know what to expect, as i've now had a 10 and an 8. While it lacks the flavor and intensity of it's older siblings, this is a damn good, well crafted beer. I could find myself probably reaching for a 6 more often, though I still think the 8's and 10 are overall better beers. This one is just really smooth and refreshing, lot's of bready malt and plum, this is a delicious beer."
""
""
""
""
"O: What else can be expected here? It's definitely the lightest of the Rocheforts and knows this fact; yet it can easily stand toe to toe with the other two in terms of complexity. Just another excellent trappist offering, really."
""
""
""
"O: This is a great beer with a ton of complexity, while staying quite drinkable. A bit too carbonated, though - it is a bit prickly. A great Dubbel, though."

""
"Overall - Just like I thought, this was an excellent beer. I went into it expecting something good, and it did not disappoint. Condor recommended and approved, very good example of a good Belgian brew of any style. Those monks know what they are doing."
"Another very nice Trappist beer. Has a lot of flavor and a decent amount of complexity, I could easily drink more of this, but I only have one bottle. I love Trappist beers, and this one is no exception."

"O- A must-try. Remarkable flavor for 7.5%. This stuff was gone faster than I thought it would be, and it was a great way to consecrate my Rochefort chalice. Another great beer from Rochefort."

"At 7.5% ABV and almost 50 cents an ounce, it's a little too much to use for a session beer (duh!), but I bet a bomber of this would make for a damn good hour or more -- if you could show the patience to savor it. Honestly, I'm sure I'm overrating it, but it's awfully damn good."

"Beer is medium weight in body, with carbonation of medium-high intensity, resulting in a beer that gradually, creates a mass of foamy bubbles across the palate (so, mouthfeel is foamy and smooth). Finishes with a flash of ethanol heat in the nostrils, leading to a semi-dry close, with fairly intense stickiness lingering across the palate."

""
"Pours a toffee amber topped with a bone white two finger fluffy head. Excellent retention and significant lacing. Candi sugar notes, some spice, candied dates, figs, general bready and yeastiness on the nose. Bread crust, yeast, light buttered caramel notes, accents of dark fruit especially fig, date, and a hint of raisin as well as some nutiness. Generally, a light bodied fairly dry brew. An excellent dubbel that finishes dry with plenty of subtle complexity."

"O: A unique brew with the herbs and medicinal qualities becoming much more noticalbe as it warms. It's a sipper and a terrific stand in for an aperitif. The carbonation compliments the herbal flavours well, and lends to the mineral flavours. Overall it's a unique drink and one unparalleled by anything else I've tried."
"This pours a murky brown color with a decent beige head. There is a fair amount of sweet malts in the scent with yeast and citrus. The taste is sweet, smooth, and flavorful. There is the taste of sugar, plums, and other hints of fruit in the flavor as well. Well made, complex, yet very simple. Glad to see a brewery that concentrates on just 3 beers and makes them to perfection."

"I simply fell in love for the Rochefort 6 - an inviting aroma, but a vigorously carbonated taste. I was ready to come up with criticism if necessary, but in the end I had a joyful experience that will definitely be repeated and, in fact, expanded with other Trappist beers."
"The taste is much like the aroma with sweet barley malts, dark fruits, and a roasted finish. This is an enjoyable beer."

"(O)- Overall, a superb Dubbel. Nothing out of place; fitting the style perfectly. Easily one of the best that unfortunately gets overlooked by the rarer examples."

"Probably the best damn dubbel I've ever had. You better believe I'm buying this more often. And, why aren't you?"

"O – This is a fantastic beer and it couldn’t have come at a better time. Over the past year, I’ve been trying as many beers as I could get my hands on. Recently, I’ve actually been getting kind of bored with trying different beers as many of them have started to taste the same. I’ve been getting more and more underwhelmed by a lot of the ones I’ve tried, and so I’ve become more interested in drinking a small rotation of beers that I’ve tried and loved. This beer right here has shown me something new and wonderful and has given me a new sense of purpose in going out and drinking as many different beers as I possibly can. I have a feeling I’m going to be going through a lot of Trappist beers in the near future."

"O-l am a fan of dubbels and this one fell solidly in the middle of the pack for me. The smell and flavor profiles were nicely balanced and unique, but a little underwhelming compared to some of my favorites. The carbonation was also a little heavy-handed and distracting at first, but when it faded towards the end of the glass, the brew got a little watery. Perhaps my expectations were too high in light of the Rochefort 8 and 10, which I love, but this 6 is merely serviceable. For the price, I think there are better options."

"O- my favorite rochefort yet! Nutty, and fruity, and earthy, it's perfect for this time of year! The only negatives i can think of is the almost nonexistant head and the high crispy carbonation. Other then that, she's glorious."

"O: this is a great beer, well rounded, delicious, great mouthfeel, can't ask for much more."
""
""
""
""
"Can't belive I never reviewed this. Someone strip me of my ""I wanna be a monk"" card. Pours dark brown with a very noisy, frothy light tan head that settles quickly without much lace. Smell is caramel malt, some citrus fruits, and a hint of wood. Taste is plums, followed by a dry woodiness. There is some citrus up front but when the wood hits....this just sounds wrong somehow...it dries out completely. The finish is dry and a touch sharp. IMHO it is a perfect example of what a dubbel tastes like. The mouthfeel is aggresively carbonated and seems a bit lighter than you'd expect from the taste or the look. Overall, its fantastic. It's only held back by the yeast strain constantly reminding me of the 10, which has the same flavor notes but more complexity. But this is a great, great example of the style."

"O - A light, extremely drinkable Belgian ale. The flavors blend together quite nicely, and the alcohol is masked very well. Subtle yet complex."

"Pours murky copper beer with excellent, absolutely resistant fizzy off-white head. Rich aroma of yeasts, caramel, toffee & dark fruits. Very good flavour, quite similar to aroma: fruity, zesty, not very sweet, of course, lighter than other Rocheforts. Good carbonation, full body."
""
""
"This is a medium to lighter bodied brew with an effervescent level of carbonation. It is quite dried out but surprisingly carries plenty of malty flavorings without the residual sugars. For more than 7%, it is quite drinkable and snappy/crisp into the finish. The hop flavoring here is herbal to earthy and well utilized to keep the alcohol and malt flavors balanced. This is Rochefort, no surprise to the quality here. I could/would/should drink this on a more regular basis."

"i feel like this is a little less exciting than the 8 and the 10. it pours hazy hand redish brown, not dark and not light, kind of dense looking. a very very robust tan head than doesnt subside at all. the nose is real spicy from the yeast, and the malt profile is big and sweet. the only problem is the the flavor doesnt really come through from the nose to the taste, and every thing is sort of muted on the palate. there is a nice fruity element to this one, but all the flavors are faded except for the yeast. the mouthfeel is great, really light and airy for a beer of such size. its real easy drinking, and dangerously so at this abv. im not sure i had the freshest bottle in the world, but i wasnt amazed by this."
""
"Overall I really like this one. It's very drinkable, yet has a great character, and most important for me: it feels really fresh and not too sweet. A very balanced beer."
""
"Pours a slightly hazy deep golden/copper color with a good sized bubbly off white head that quickly dissipates to a cap on top. Smells of caramel, brown and burnt sugars, dark fruits, and yeasty phenols. The flavor is just what the aroma described it would be. Light and fruity with lots of dark and brown sugars with some yeasty flavors. Medium body with an insane amount of carbonation and a sweet sugary and bubbly mouthfeel. This is a very nice flavorful Belgian strong ale. I would have liked a bit less carbonation, but I say that about a lot of Belgian beers."
"Poured out a nice mahogany brown with an off-white head that retained very well. Smells of bread/yeast yeast with some fruit and raisin notes. Taste has a slight breadyness to it, with the alcohol being hidden very well. Mouthfeel is well carbonated with a wet finish. Not my favorite, would prefer the 10 but still a great drink."
""
"M-has a little breeze in it, I love it."
""
""
"Great Trappist brew that everyone should try (at least once). The flavor profile, while complex, worked together nicely - the sign of a Belgian beer done correctly."
""
""
"Another top-class brew. Excellent profile, great taste incorporating a dynamic and refreshing complexity with the pleasant maltiness. Seek it out."
""
""
"O - This is pretty drinkable for a BSDA, perhaps a bit misleading in the style given I do not particularly consider an apple as a dark fruit. This is one to savor."
"O- I could see myself enjoying this beer with a steak, I would like to try the 12. Not an everyday drinker but I could definitely enjoy this on a rainy day."
"O: Very easy drinking, but still has the complexity of a Belgian. I think I like this better than 8 but not quite as much as 10 (though the styles are distinct)."
""
""
"O: Definitely has that classic trappist ester profile, but this one's a bit thin and the carbonation is overly fizzy."

"330 ml bottle into chalice, best by 3/10/2015. Pours murky reddish brown color with a 1 finger foamy cream colored head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Slight spotty lacing clings to the glass, with a good amount of carbonation streaming up. Aromas of huge raisin, prune, fig, molasses, bread, toffee, earth, herbal, and yeast spiciness. Very nice and complex aromas with nice strength. Very big on the dark fruits. Taste of raisin, caramel, prune, molasses, biscuit, toffee, herbal, earth, and yeast spices. Light dark fruit tang on the finish; with lingering notes of dark fruit, toffee, molasses, biscuit, and earthy spiciness on the finish for a short bit. Very nice flavor balance and complexity; with plenty of robust flavors. Medium carbonation and body; with a nice creamy, slick, and slightly prickly mouthfeel. Alcohol is well hidden with only a small warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is an excellent Belgian strong dark ale. Nice flavor balance, depth, and complexity; and extremely smooth to sip on. No complaints, very enjoyable."

"11.2oz bottle, poured into my wide mouth Chimay glass, pours a murky rusty brown color with a thin head that sticks around as a foam atop the ale. Doesn't leave any lacing on the glass, but is still nice to look at. Aromas are rich with ripe, dark fruit, bready malt, and it's earthy. Tastes are earthy, fruity, raisin, bread, toffee, yeast - nice meld of flavors. Body is on the thinner side of medium, higher carbonation allows the ale to cover the palate while the alcohol warms with a tingle. It's been a long time coming, but I finally got around to picking this one up. Quality brew from a quality brewery, just as expected."
""
""
""
""
""
"T: Opens with a lot of malt sweetness. Freshly baked dark bread, plum and raisin, cola nut, banana and a good amount of Belgian yeast. Mouthfeel is a bit thin with a good amount of carbonation. Definitely not up there with the 10 but a great beer nonetheless."
""
""
"Overall this is a very well put together Belgian Ale, although this one is a tad lighter than the Trappistes 8 & 10 from this brewer. Now don't get me wrong, I truly think they are all exceptional brews..."
""

"overall: great stuff - preferred over the 8, and very close to the 10"

"Overall - A light and very drinkable beer given the ABV. It might be just a touch too carbonated but the tastes are well balanced and you can taste the quality ingredients. The Rochefort 10 is still my favourite by a mile though."

""
"Overall: Wow. This is it. This is my beer. The flavors, the cohesion, it all really comes together to surprise and delight. It's fitting that this is made at a monastery because it's as close to religion as I get. Sadly, heaven ain't cheap and at almost $6 a bottle, Rochefort's only losing point vanquishes it to only special occasions. If you're feeling special, spend the cash and delight yourself."

"O- Its a great beer, a sipper, a treat, and an absolute classic."
""
"This is my first of the Rochefort series. This beer pours a nice mahogany reddish brown color with some nice carbonation streaming from the bottom. The head is off white, fluffy with big bubbles but recedes very quickly and leaves a few spots of bubbles on the top of the headless beer. Aroma is of nice caramelized figs, a bit of dark stone fruits and some nice raisin spicy like notes. Pretty complex and interesting. Perfect with my short ribs i prepared earlier. The taste is very similar to the aromas, a tad thin for me but very true to the style. The plum, fig and roasted caramel notes play nicely but its a touch thin for me so this feels a little fake. I also get a touch of grape, maybe some red wine like flavors. The mouthfeel is nicely carbonated, maybe a bit too over carbonated for me actually, but refreshing with each sip. The best part of this is that you can drink it slow and it will flatten out so it does get better. Overall this is a great beer. Nice addition of red meat dishes, grilled pork and even with some ice cream this would work. I would avoid fish, shellfish and poultry at all costs with this as its a strong flavored brew."
"Adding the yeast diminishes the fresh fruit aspect, making it more earthy, and cuts the carbonation. Definitely better without the yeast."
""
"O - This is a delightful beer, more so because it's not at all what I was expecting. I guess I was thinking something more malty and robust and less fresh and light and delicate. What a treat."
""
"330ml bottle. Westmalle Chalice glass. Enjoyed on sept´11 -& many times in the past- Pours light mahogany in color. Beige, small sized bubbled, foam. Lasting creamy crown. Lacing collars & rings on sides. Spices, yeast & molasses to the nose. Toffee hint aromas. Sweet upfront. Intense caramel malt flavor with underlying fruits & spices. Gentle alcoholic warming. Full body, moderate carbonation. Dry fruity finish. Notes of chocolate malt on the aftertaste. Delightfull !!"

"Overall: Excellent dark Belgian that I throughly enjoyed."
"Really good stuff overall. Complex. Good balance. Unique flavors. Everything I love in a Belgian brew."
"Overall I liked this beer and I thought that it was a good example of a traditional BSDA, everything seemed to be right where it should be for the style. This beer had very good drinkability, it went down very smooth for the style and the flavor did a good job at keeping my entertained, I wish I had another bottle to drink with dinner. What I liked most about this bee was pretty much everything, all aspects seemed be on par for the style. What I liked least about this beer was the price, if this was $3.50 I would buy it much more often. I would be this beer again, but only for special occasions because of the price, and I recommend this to anyone who is a fan of Belgian beer, and this may be a good beet to get someone into the style. I was pretty impressed with this beer, and I will for sure be trying their other beer shortly. To me this is the benchmark for the style and really good beer."
""
"Pours lighter than the 8 with a light brown murky color, one finger off-white head. Smells of dried dark fruit and spice, light yeast funk to boot. Flavor seems lacking, with slightly watered down figs and spice and some lingering yeast on the finish. Thinner mouthfeel than I expected, medium high carbonation, easy drinking I guess. Only okay. Does not live up to the other Rocheforts."
"One of the better BSDAs I have found."

"An outstanding beer. Fruity and slightly sweet, but perhaps the flavor is not quite strong enough to support the high carbonation. Nevertheless, it is a world classic."

"Bottle dated 280114. Poured from a 33 cl bottle into a chalice. It pours hazy brown due to sediment with a frothy white head. The head quickly dissipates and leaves a little bit of white head on the top. Bubbles can be seen meeting the head, indicating high carbonation. The aromas of caramel, fig, roasted malt, and Belgian yeast hit the nose. I can also detect a small amount of alcohol. The taste is sweet, but not too sweet. The flavors of caramel and fig go a long way towards covering up the alcohol content, but the faint taste of alcohol is there. The mouthfeel is medium with high carbonation and a dry finish. The carbonation prepares you for the next drink. This is very easy to drink. Overall, this is an outstanding beer."
"O: Another excellent brew – all three I tried, 6, 8,10 were exceptionally. Really enjoyed drinking these brews."
""
""
"Poured from a 33cl bottle into a goblet, bottle date of 080915. This pours a hazy tea color with a massive fizzy head which dissipates faster than I can type this sentence. The smells are wonderful, very fruity, lots of dark fruit, a little belgian yeast esters, some brown sugar and alcohol. The feel is medium, high carbonation. The taste is wonderful, a little fruity, some peach, strawberries, apricot, lots of dark fruit and some brown sugar, very nice."

"Pours a dark brown amber with a big, two finger off-white, light coffee colored head. Aroma of dark fruits mostly, also grapes, caramel and hints of clove and spice. Really smooth caramel malt to start, one of the better highlights of this flavor in a beer that I've had. Not huge caramel flavor per se, but taste, amount of sweetness and mouthfeel combo is perfect. Moves to dark fruit notes before a lighter finish of white grapes and a pinch of spice. Not the biggest or best flavor profile, but very cohesive and excellently crafted."

"Taste is smoooth. Banana belgian hops, mixed with bready biscuity malts. Very pleasant and drinkable. Yes its a belgian, yes everyone should take note...its delicious."
""

"Simply a perfect blend."
""
"Loved the 10, meh on the 8. Huge head on the pour, with close to zero lacing. Dark amber hue, with a cap of foam a few minutes after the head subsided. I get dark fruits on the nose, blueberries, raspberriesl. Some raisin, fig, fruitcake aromas too. Clove, bread, kola nut, light cherry, and a mineral water like aftertaste. A bit different taste profile from typical Belgian dark ales. I dig it."
""
""
"O: Complex and well balanced, this beer is pretty easy to drink and enjoy. Very good flavors but just a hint too much for this to be sessionable - I really felt satisfied after the one. The smell and taste of alcohol is well hidden."
"O: Overall, I was disappointed with this offering. Rochefort 8 is a very good beer, and Rochefort 10 is world class. This isn’t even in the same ballpark. I’m glad I had it, to complete the Rochefort trifecta, but I will not have this one again."
""
"I also have the Rochefort 8 and 10 and am looking forward to trying."

"O - This is the second Rochefort beer that I've tried and it doesn't disappoint at all. The aromas and flavors have a lot going on and are really quite good. On top of that, the plentiful carbonation and fairly light mouthfeel make this very enjoyable to drink. I would love to have some more of this, as well as try some other available Trappist offerings."

"The last of the three Rochefort's. Poured from bottle to a Duvel tulip. The beer pours a deep ruby red with a nice 2 finger off-white head, looks great. Good retention and lacing. The nose is a mild yet delightful mix of yeast, clover, raisin, licorice, fig. Nice fruity character. The flavor is complex and full: Figs, toffee, prunes, licorice, toast, coffee, raisins. Very nice and developed. Well balanced. Very smooth with a fiar amount of carbonation. Overall, terrific. Can't believe it took me this long to finish off the trio. Recommended."
""
"The beer is a dark brown color, not black. Looks like a true dubbel not a belgian strong dark ale. Scents of honey, brown sugar, molasses. Very sharp sweetness on the initial scent. Not much lacing. Taste is absolutely BOLD! Sweet belgian sweet candy on the wash, massive molasses on the front, but of course with great brewers, not cloying. Absolutely magnificent tasting. Very light plummy taste also. Damn, I wish I could afford this every session. The taste is delicious and memorable. Easy drinking with a medium mouth feel. Very smooth and a joy!"
"Cheers."
""
""
"Overall - I really enjoy this beer. I have to give it credit for remaining more subtle to the taste which perhaps allows it to appeal to a broader audience. A great introductory to the blue and green cap, no doubt! Almost all of the ingredients used are virtually the same. You can definitely tell that with each fermentation period, Trappistes Rochefort continually add more of the same ingredients used to conjure this tasty little treat, plus MORE. Not my favorite, but a superb beer nonetheless!"

"That was also true for the alcohol. I could feel the buzz when I was done with everything but not at all when I was enjoying this beer. While this isn't flashy or has a sparkling appearance, this was extremely enjoyable and easy to down. Although there wasn't a lot of sediment here, this had every characteristic of a classic Belgian beer and anyone looking for an appreciation of a malted barley beverage will find this quite enjoyable."

""
""
""

"O: This is decent, but there's nothing that really stands out here. It's a very delicate beer that's easy to drink, unfortunately the price of this is a bit high though this is a very drinkable beer."
""
"A finely crafted Belgian ale with no real flaw. My experience with the Rochefort offerings I've had is that their richness comes in the feel and weight of the body moreso than the flavour. If that were adjusted a bit where the flavours were made bolder, they would be exceptional beers, including this one in front of me now. Well worth a try but not my favorite for the style."

"O. Finally, we get Rochefort in Texas. That makes five out of the seven accredited Trappist breweries (I don't expect to see that other one beginning with W any time in the foreseeable future). I'm looking forward to trying the 8 and the 10."

"O- This beer shows promise but I would bypass this one for the 8 or the 10."
"O - Just became available in Texas so I had to try it. The taste and aroma were not as pronounced as expected. The aroma was a bit hard to detect and the flavor was only a bit stronger. That aside, the beer is still very enjoyable but I dont see the hype for this beer. I guess I just need to try it a few more times."
"overall, a decent ""little brother"" of the excellent Rochefort 10."
"D: Like most strong ales, this is a sipper for me. I like to savor every bit of it that I can. It's VERY drinkable for the amount of alcohol in the nose and taste. Awesome beer."
"A really, really good beer. Pretty obvious it's from Belgium as the flaws are miniscule."
"I am surprised that I did not like this beer more given my fantastic experience with 10, but the toffee/oxidized flavors just don't do much for me."
"O: Very good beer. Great as it warmed. Worth the money"
"Pours out a hazy dark brown beer, roughly a 2 inch head, and, this sounds funny, the head crackled loudly as it dissipates,much more so then other beers. Smells of licorice, malt. Taste is extremely hard to describe, its sweet, has a very mild licorice taste, tastes of spices like winter beers, but none i can describe. A very interesting beer. No hops whatsoever. Mouthfeel is slick, mild carbonation."
"O: beer must be refreshing; this is a complex beer; but as Shostakovich is complex but not nice (in my view), I think this one is the Shostakovich of Belgian beers. Books can be written about it, but does it invite to buy another one? Brrr."
"High carbonation and medium mouthfeel."
"That is, of course, a high bar."
"O- this is a good beer but not something I have had before."
"O: Overall this is a very good and unique beer. I am glad I tried it and would have another."
"Overall while this isn't my favorite of the Rocheforts it is still an excellent beer in its own right and I would have one of these again in a heartbeat."
"2004 bottle, seven years old, I probably shouldn't be rating such an old bottle but I'll adjust it accordingly. Pours a dark pumpkin with a medium head. ppretty persistent carbonation. Nose is a lot of raisins, dates, very sugary, slight cardboard. Mouth is fruit forward, honey-soaked figs and dates, toffee. Pleasantly yeasty and a lightly cardboard finish. A bit aggressive on that malted dark fruit, but it's pleasant in its way. Certainly over the hill, I need to drink a fresh bottle of this, so I'm gonna bump the scores up to adjust for that."
"This beer is just so phenomenal. I saw that it is listed as a BSD...it seems like more of a dubbel to me, but whatever. It had a nice amber color, almost red with an off-white head that had great retention and lace. The aroma is strongly of caramel and medium dark fruits (not so much plum and prune). On the tongue it is very malt forward but it doesn't finish anything close to being sweet, despite what the aroma lead me to think it would. It has a medium high carbonation, which helps the finish. Fuckig epic beer."
"Dry finish, the carbonation is lively and crisp. I liked this one but it's definitely a step down in deliciousness and profundity from the legendary 10. The 8 is still on my must-try list."
"The favorite Rochefort of this not big Rochefort fan."
"Overall - Very tasty and smooth. Still a sipper mosty from the alcohol at the end. Not as complex as 10 but its a great selecting if 10 was simply to much for you to handle with all its flavors, high alcohol etc. World class beer here."
"D/O: The best test of any beer is ""would you have another""? The answer here is ""yes"". I'd have another right after I finished this one, if I could. Very good."
"Poured a reddish brown with a tan head about a finger thick. The aroma is full on yeast and sweet malt, which follows the taste of toasted malt and molasses. There is some fig and big dark wheat bread.  The body is light- medium and a fair amount of carbonation. Really pleasant and well balanced. "
"Poured a massive almost all head of off-white color. The body has a hazy apple cider appearance. Smell is very mild in my sample, with just a little dried fruit reminding me of fig and some caramel. Taste is more of the same flavors, mild, and with a buttery texture. There's a subtle long tingly finish. This is probably one of the mildest of the Trappistes. A fine beer."
"Overall: Not as incredible as Rochefort 10, but still one of the top Belgian dark beers for sure. A welcoming, complex beer that is extremely easy to drink. All I need to do is try Rochefort 8 and see which one of these holds the longest redrinkability!"
"This beer poured out as a nice looking brown color with an off white head on top. The lacing was pretty good here. The smell of the beer had a big yeasty aroma to it with some darker malts giving off a little sweetness. The taste was a little smokey I thought, I found that to be a little interesting. The other flavors of bread, and caramel were in there too. The mouthfeel was decent in my opinion, though that the beer had a good softness to it. Overall not a bad Belgian brew at all. Quite enjoyable."
"O: A very good belgian ale. This is one you could sip all night."
"O - A good beer of medium complexity, a bit light to my taste."
"Very much like the 8 but more watery. Takes on the same malt character and fruit. Obviously the same yeast strain. A little thinner in the middle makes the alcohol show through too much but still very delicious. Tastes like the aroma, with a large variety of dried fruits. Nutty and dry in the finish. Quick and abrupt."
"O: A great aroma, nice taste and very drinkable and smooth. A nicely crafted beer."
"I like this beer but I was expecting to be a little more impressed. I actually thought its nose was its strong suit. I guess I need to try the 8 and the 10."
"O: Extremely drinkable and pleasant Belgian Strong Dark Ale. If this was easier to come by in my area I would make this a mainstay of my beer fridge."
"Overall, definitely a good beer but not a gem the way the 8 and 10 are. I am trying to review it on its own merits (which are notable) rather than size it up against the others, but it is hard to ignore the comparison entirely. I certainly like this beer, but it is merely good, rather than outstanding."
"From notes 8/1/11. Pours a deep amber-brown with good clarity and a fizzy head. There are some floaties, but I could have avoided them with a better pour. The aroma is a mix of floral, brown sugar, bready malt, fruit - raisins, peaches, apricots, plums - and earth. There’s little that I can easily ascribe to hops. It smells kinda like a fresh hunk of cinnamon raisin bread topped and honeysuckle. The taste is also quite nice. Lots of sweetness that quickly blossoms into earthy complexity. The feel is a bit fizzy for my taste but not bad. This is a very good beer with plenty of Belgian yeast flavor."
"Just like with my previous Orval, it did not matter how gentle my pour, the head was forming at an incredible rate. It settled into a rocky finger of tawny head with good retention. Color was a deep coppery-amber with NE-quality clarity, thanks in part to my pour. Nose was VERY malty - toffee, caramel, fresh baked bread, dried dark fruits and even a light must. Mouthfeel was silky, gliding over my tongue on its way to my throat, but I held it in my mouth to swirl it around. As a self-avowed hophead, the sugary sweetness of the malt really hit me. Wow! The finish had a bit of heat to it and I had to sit back and collect myself before taking a second sip. Double yoi! Now, the heat and sweetness gave way to a melange of flavors, including the aforementioned caramel/toffee and raisin bread. Wild. I just worry that I am not the intended audience for this style of beer, but I hope that it suffices to say that I did enjoy it, all in all."
"The beer is brown, with a thick, off white head that leaves ample lacing on the glass. The aroma offers yeast, malt, caramel, toffee. The flavor is great, with yeast and caramels leading the way. Not nearly as bold or flavorful as Rochefort 10. The body is thinner than is customary for the style. Smooth on the palate, this brew is highly drinkable. I would have this again."
"O- Not a bad beer... Has the misfortune of being compared alongside the Rochefort 8 as well as other notorious Belgian strong darks. Will try again in the future, to see if maybe I just got a bad batch/bottle."
"D- Ummm, struggling to sum this beer up really. Probably because i found it so bland. Carbonation and dryness levels on the tongue were right for a trappist dark ale but there was just no complexity in the nose or on the palate. Really forgettable. Will need to hunt down a fresher example."
"D- **** there is definitely something wrong here. the ""expiration date"" is 060213 so i'm assuming this bottle is about 3 years old. should have had plenty of time to develop but maybe the yeast ate up everything and just left me with bubbles. i was very excited about this beer and feel hugely disappointed. at least i can rely on the couple bottles i have of 8 and 10 and i WILL re-review this 6 when i get a better, perhaps younger, bottle."
"O - A very multifaceted, flavoursome and warming ale. Its all there but the combination of flavours just doesnt hit the spot for my palate."
"Rochefort 6 is so different than 8 and 10 that you might be tempted to think less of 6 because of it. Forget about 8 and 10. 6 holds its own against the best BSDAs in the world. I avoided buying it for the longest time because I thought it'd be too much like a Dubbel (a style that I am routinely underwhelmed by). As it turns out this is like a super-Dubbel. It has the narrow scope of a Dubbel but simultaneously achieving a complexity matched by few Dubbbels. This would be a perfect pairing with rabbit and a mushroom risotto. It would likely perform marvelously at the Thanksgiving table. Don't make the mistake that I did in avoiding this beer for so long."
"I honestly don't understand how beers like this score so highly. All I tasted in this beer was alcohol. There was nothing ""beery"" whatsoever that I was able to pull out. I might as well have been drinking rum or scotch. It poured dark brown, with tanish head. Aroma was alcohol. Taste was alcohol. Mouthfeel was completely over carbonated, and after a sip from the bottle it almost exploded in my face. Overall, Not impressed whatsoever."
"My 3rd Rochefort (had 8 and 10). Been looking forward to trying this one. Popped the top, and a loud pop and hiss followed. Smokey cloudy vapor just swirls around the top of the bottle. Crazy cool. Slowly poured into Brooklyn tulip glass. Pours a murky brown color, very little head, but visible small bubbles come up the side of the glass. Smell- dark fruit, raisins, prunes, some alcohol detectable, brown sugar, winter spices. A lot going on here. Taste- SUPER rich carbonation, definite raisin presence, dark fruits. The taste is not as complex as the aroma, but I guess I didn't expect this to be as rich and flavorful as the 10. The carbonation is crazy- its almost too much, making it almost acidic from the sharpness of the bubbles. It's a little bit of a knock of this one. Overall, this is a good beer, that I am glad I tried, but it pales in comparison to me of its bigger brothers (8 and 10)"
"the lightest of the three and i would say the most savory. Granted... This still have all the belgian ester notes, they just don't come in as huge as the others. Pour is a murky beige with a nice belgian head... Not as retained but still quite sugar rich voluminous. Nose of late summer, autumn fruit... Plum, pear and clove. Palate a lot dryer than expected. Low FG... Crisp and lean with distinct straw musk. Fades toasty with hints of sesame. Distinct nutmeg dryness. Perfect for pork and thyme, a cubano sandwich, yams, or as an accompanyment to thanksgiving starchs."
"A wonderful marriage of Belgian yeast, sweet fruits, caramel and bready malts. Delicate and delicious."
"O: one of the more disappointing rocheforts. I had this many years ago along with the 8 and 10 and remember enjoying it much more."
"The mouthfeel is medium to full bodied and has a great level of carbonation; very high. Overall a good Belgian brew that goes down easily and is very tasty. This is definitely enjoyable, no matter what style you're looking for. Not over-the-top great, but definitely something to try at least once."
"O - I have not had the 8 or the 10 but I would like to try them after having this beer. I would not turn the 6 down down but I probably would not go out of my way to seek it out again. Fairly well balanced for a beer clocking in at 7.5% ABV. I love the typical Belgian characters so overall I am pleased with this beer."
"Carbonation seems a bit heavy, but it eases off as it warms. Good, thick body. Rich, well-balanced taste. Good beer to finish the evening with."
"Very good. I'm not sure I've ever had the 6 before, but it seems like a great low-alcohol (and I use that almost comically) to most Belgian Dark Strongs-bringing much of the same aromas and flavors to the table with a mere 7.5% alcohol. As with most Belgians, this is strong enough (and sneaky enough) to knock you out so be forewarned, but this would be a great Belgian Dark Strong to pair with Lamb or Duck."
"Kind of ordinary, but unique, but really not grabbing my attention. Carbonation is too off putting, and not much distinctive-ness. I say... meh."
"Overall, I expected far more from Rochefort."
"Overall a very pleasant drink, quite complex and exciting, rich and fruity. I would definitely get this again."
"O-A bit of a disappointment - I really liked Trappistes Rochefort 10, and hope the 8 I bought at the same time as this 6 will be better. I won’t buy the 6 again."
"Overall: Great beer, not just a watered down version of the 8 and the 10."
"O: The younger, less talented brother. Still very nice though. 4"
"PP (Price Point) - $4.99 for an imported Trappist beer is fair, considering what some U.S. brewers charge for a 12ozer, 7.2% is very nice. Mid range, you decide!"
"A very pleasant, extremely well done beer, Rochefort 6 is almost like the restrained sibling to the more assertive 8 or 10. Nicely balanced and complex to the end, I could easily drink another."
"O - I had high expectations, based on my love of Rochefort 8. My high expectations were surpassed, although I believe I like the R8 better and more eager than ever to try it, and the 6, again"
"Overall: A unique beer but not something I'd commonly go back to."
"O- Very high drinkability, some faint alcoholic notes might be detected but they mostly bring a nice warming feel. A beer with no flaws and a very much classic belgian feel to it. Not as amazing as most trappist beers though"
"O: Loved this. Really can't go wrong with Rochefort, they know what they're doing."
"O: I like this one. It doesn't hold a candle to its biggest brother in terms of complexity and overall awe, but it's not meant to. A very enjoyable, albeit lighter overall Belgian Dark from the legendary Trappistes Rochefort."
"Overall Really a good all around late night sipping brew."
"This beer enjoyed in a chalice glad at the abner pub in Norman, ok. Pours a thick brown with a slight amount of tan head with not much lacing and retention. The aroma is slightly fruity, with hints of figs and plums, as well as some smoke and nuttiness. The taste is fairly sweet with fig and cherry notes with some maltiness added in. The mouthfeel is fairly overcarbonated and dry. Overall a good beer, but I wouldn't pay $12 for it again."
"Overall, this is a nice Belgian Dark Ale I would definately have again if I ever come across it in a trade(unfortunately, Rochefort isn't available in TX... yet). It's the first of the 3(10/8/6) I've recently aquired, and very much looking forward to the others!"
"Overall: Very balanced in many ways. Not a mind blowing beer, but a sort of beer where you just won't be disappointed. Those monks sure know how to brew a goddamn beer."
"$4.95 a single."
"Overall, its good. Probably won't be back to buy more, but its not too bad for this old."
"Pours a murky dark brown color with a 1 inch bone colored head that fades to nothing. Slight lacing slowly slides back into the beer on the drink down. Some sediment is seen floating around in the beer. Smells of fermented raisins, sweet malt, and spices. I also get a very subtle hint of funk and vinegar. Taste is of caramel, dark fruits, spices, and Belgian yeast. Lots of carbonation makes for a bubbly and crisp mouthfeel. Overall, I was a bit disappointed in this beer. I was expecting something way better all around based on reviews and information I have read. This isn't a bad beer per se but I guess it's just not up my alley."
"O- Overall a very solid brew."
"pretty much anything that can handle a sweet addition."
"overall; a really hard beer to describe but it's good. So well blended and mild, I wouldn:t take anyone else""s word on it, a must try."
"Tasty beer and enjoyable in its own regard, although I do prefer it's bigger brother ""8". More solid craftsmanship from the monks at Abbaye de Notre-Dame de Saint-Remy."
"O - Lovely beer bursting with fruity-apple flavours. Complex in composition due to the various layers of sugary that create so many great flavours. Well worth the effort."
"O- Not as good as the other legendary brews this brewery puts out, but this one still manages to hold its own."
"much darker thicker than 8 and more brown. slight amber color"
"(11.2oz bottle). Pours cloudy dark amber color with huge chunky, khaki head. Small, active carbonation bubbles. Aroma has lots of dark fruit, candied sugar, florals and caramel. Taste is sweet malt-more like caramel-than the aggressive malt than I’m used to in a Rochefort. Also getting some herbal/earthy notes. Thin to medium bodied with a slick texture. Finish is smooth. A very nice beer."
"O- This is a good beer, but falls a little short of it's pedigree for me. Rochefort 8 and 10 are two of the best beers in the world for me. This one is merely good bordering on great. It's worth checking out if you haven't had it, otherwise I'll probably not go out of my way to get this one again."
"Flavour is soft fruit, cocoa, malt, honey, and just the right amount of bitterness to pull it all together."
"O: This is delicious; I just wish it was much cheaper."
"O- This doesn't really taste like a Belgian ale IMO, it almost reminds me of a Scotch ale. This one had about 3 years age on it and it was just fantastic. Maybe my favorite from Rochefort, definitely finished this one the quickest."
"I agree completely with another reviewer who said this drinks more like a dubbel, had to check twice to make sure it was classified as an SDA. Rating it within its style, it loses half a point for that overall. This is really an easy one to take down..."
"It's been years since I had this, long before the 10 and 8, and before I had much appreciation for these beers, so it was overdue to try it again. Really glad I did. I can't say it's better than the 8 or 10 but it is unique and great in its own way."
"Delicious and well-balanced, with hefty but not overpowering sweetness, complemented very well by the mouthfeel. This is a perfect example of what flavors can come from great malts and great yeast. The alcohol is practically invisible. Drinks like a dubbel; surprised it's not classified as that style here."
"O - A deliciously complex double. A tad thin for my liking. The booze is fantastically well balanced, playing an integral role in the flavor profile."
"O: This one is a bit lackluster. After having the 10, this one is shabby."
"It's all part of the adventure, baby!"
"Overall Drinkability - I had higher hopes for this beer, especially after having the 10. While enjoyable, I'd pass up this beer in a heartbeat if the 10 is also in stock."
"O- i feel that this is the weakest that i have tried of the rochefort family. certainly the weakest of the main three. i dont see myself paying the same price for this as i would the 8 ever again."
"D-A really solid example of what a traditional belgian could be. However, for the price I would make the jump to 8 or 10 before buying this again, it just doesn't hold up to those two."
"Overall: A sipper like the other Rocheforts. I liked this the best out of the three, but it isn't something I intend to buy again, especially at the price."
"O- This is a nice beer that I am very happy that I am happy I tried. This is a good beer and solid, just not as good as 8 and 10, lacks the complexity. Since it is the same price as 8 I don't see myself buying this again because I could just get a bottle of 8 that is sitting right next to it."
"Overall: A good beer that's true to style and a delight to drink."
"Long malty aftertaste corresponding well with main flavor of the beer."
"O- Overall this one is not bad, but clearly not as good as the 8 or the 10. But still a very good beer."
"A top-notch beer all around. I'd still recommend the 8 over the 6, but either way, you really can't go wrong."
"D- you want another sip and another sip but let this one warm up the flavors augment from fruit to bread and malts but nothing to strong or overwhelming just delicious"
"M/D: A true enjoyment. Just enough carbonation to wake the palate. This is an exceptional brew."
"D: Extremely easy drinkability. Absurdly delicious!"
"D- Drink slow to enjoy all the great characteristics of this brew. With that said, Drinkability is fantastic for me !"
"D - Very nice for what it is but I'll stick with the #10 offering form these fine monks."
"D - This is a very solid brew from a World Class brewery. If you see it buy it."
"D: The beer was pretty easy to drink. There weren't any overly strong flavors, and the beer had little bitterness. Overall, I liked the flavors in this beer, but they were subtly displayed. I also thought Rochefort 6 was similar in many ways to New Belgium's Abbey Belgian Style Ale, but the later is less expensive. I imagine the flavors in Rochefort 8 and 10 will be stronger and more complex."
"Get it if you can."
"Bottom line: My glass started off underwhelming but by the end I felt as if Rochefort has earned its near legendary reputation. It's a rich, complex beer by any measure. Even at $6 a bottle, I'll be drinking this again."
"The 6 while expertly crafted is better with food than served as a meal of its own."
"M - Just south of medium bodied, good carbonation."
"The suspended carbonation is medium to high and it has a slightly buttery mouthfeel. The aftertaste is wet and fades to leave only traces of the musty flavor on the palate."
"D: A very good beer all around. It's not Rochefort 10, but still an extremely high-quality brew."
"M/D: Balanced and fruity, with a hint of alcohol. Not what I was expecting, but it was highly drinkable."
"Poured into a snifter glass. Pours murky brown with a substantial tan head that dissipated quickly. Aromas of creamy toffee malts, orange peel, burnt sugar and subtle cherries. It has a light body for the ABV with flavours of caramel malts and dark fruits finishing with mild warming spicy hops and alcohol. Smooth and drinkable. I personally prefer the 8."
"Great looking ale, big fluffy head with little bits of sediment, light soft lacing. Color is a 22 on the SRM beer color chart. Smells of plum, cranberry, raisins, roasted wheat, honey and chocolate. Taste is an enchanting experience of dark cherry, raisin, plum, cranberry, chocolate, and caramel. A great smooth fullness in the mouth, with a shimmer effect as it flows over my tongue and the back of my soft palate. Just a little too fruity and sweet for good heavy drinking, but a great flavor that makes me want more."
"D- A complex sipper that goes down smooth."
"Dark tan pour with perfect head, careful to keep the sediment in the bottle. Scent of faint candy sugar and maltiness. Refreshing flavors, yeast, malt, small floral presence in the finish. Heavy carbonation in the mouth, but smoothes out nicely. A fine beer."
" ~ This is a world renowned brewery to go along with a beer of equal value. It is worth the price."
"This is my favorite Rochefort brew simply for its drinkability. Its so hard to find, but well worth it when you do. Its easily lighter than the other 2 in flavor profile, but still maintains a vast array of flavors and complexity."
"Drinkability - this must have been a bad bottle, this is nowhere near the expereience I expected given the high ratings for this beer. I'm really disappointed, I had the Rochefort 10 and that was phenomenal."
"Taste is the same. Yeast and bread with fruit accents and a tannin taste of tea. But light. Each flavor is only a hint and they add up a delicious beer, but it's far from rich. Woody and smooth. Earthy/herbal with a sweet note and a bite from the carbonation."
"330 ml from WF, Arlington"
"Drinkability: Complex flavors and modest alcohol (given the style) make this a monk's treat. Paired nicely with some sharp dubliner and aged cheddar cheeses."
"D: I was kind of expecting something different, something with some more flavor. Although it was definitely a solid beer, it feel short of my expectations. Hopefully the 8 and 10 do not fall short as I'm looking forward to tasting them."
"CHEERS!!"
"A good beer that just falls short of my high expectations. I could still easily knock back several in a sitting."
"D - Porb one of the most drinkable 'dark ales' I've ever had."
"Drinkable but not memorable. I've had better Belgian strong darks, and two of them are from this brewery. I'll stick with my 8 and 10, thanks."
"D: The alcohol will sneak up on you if you're not careful, but overall great drinkability for 7.5%"
"D - Rochefort 6 has good drinkability despite the stark drop-off in quality from the nose to the flavor. A good beer regardless."
"Easy to pour, easy to look at, smells refreshing- pours with virtually no head very nice ruby color- the smell is the strongpoint. Hint if clove and spice on the initial and finishes nicely. This was a VoIP favorite and could be enjoyed at any time of the year. Drinkable by anyone- not just beer snobs."
"I love this beverage! I'll drink this early and often."
"This is a tasty treat. I suggest you pick a couple up if you come across."
"D - very rich in complex flavour, alcohol is present but in a positive way, this could be dangerously drinkable"
"Drinkability -- Quite pleasant, certainly lives up to its big brothers. Flavorful and complex enough to keep one at attention, an easy drinker. A beer that must be tried at least once. Lovely."
"dark muddy and brown with very apparent carbonation and a frothy head that immediately breaks and forms a film on top. smell is a sweet apple cider vinegar mixed with grape ""drink."" more of the fruitiness and a caramel malt backbone. nice bubbles in the mouthfeel. this is a nice beer, not too strong like other trappists, and the fruity/caramel combination is very different."
"Drinkability: I can sip on these guys all day."
"Overall: Excellent beer overall. I expect nothing less from the Rochefort line. Buy it when you see it."
"Not bad, but a bit young and lively, I'd go with it's elder brothers."
"I did not give this one too high of a mark for drinkability. Better than average, sure; it tastes wonderful. But it is a higher than normal price, though lower than you would expect, so that's only a small part. It's not too heavy, it's too rich. This is an alternative to wine with cheese and crackers, or a nice way to finish off a good meal. You can definitely put several of the away in one sitting, but not at a BBQ or a big party. It's a sipper, not a chugger. You won't struggle to finish it by any means, but. . . Think of it like eggs Benedict vs a breakfast sandwich. They both have an English muffin, two eggs and ham. But add hollandaise sauce and it become very rich, and you are contented with the initial serving. An egg sandwich not so much, you need the hash brown and maybe some fruit to be contented. This is eggs Benedict, and something like a Guinness would be a egg sandwich, and a Budweiser would be an egg McMuffin. Point being, good to drink, but not one to drink well into the night."
"11.2 oz into a snifter. If I had an endless supply of this brew, I might be content to drink nothing else. A lot of people seem to favor the trappist tripels, but for me the Roch 6 has no equal. What can I say? This murky, funky brew doesn't have the biggest nose of any Belgian, it's not the strongest, the flavor is somewhat mild...but it's perfect, the black sediment on the bottom of the snifter and the way the brown bubbles caress my tongue tell me everything I need to know...even though Russian Imperials Stouts are my favorite moreso than any Belgian, this is my absolute favorite beer, even over some of the wild lambics or my tops RIS. Roch 6 is simply a champion. Enough said; if you see a bottle, get it, you won't regret it."
"Pours dark maple cloudy brown with a short lived tan head. Aroma of bready yeasty malt and dark dried fruit some caramel. Taste is malty, yeast with some caramel, brown sugar. Palate is medium body with nice lively carbonation, nice mouth feel. Finish is malty, yeast, ending with some brown sugar and raisins notes, alcohol presence gives this a nice mild finish. Overall a very nice brew"
"D - This is a tasty Dark Ale, among the best that i have had in the style. I find nothing really wrong this this wonderful beer except that i wish it had more aroma. Very well done and drinkable."
"Definitely the little brother of the lot - the hops sure make a difference here, compared to the big boozy, fruity ticking malt time bombs (I say that with love) of the 8 and 10. So this is indeed good, just in a bit of an unexpected way. Hardly necessary to say, I know, but definitely give this one a try."
"D - Oh ya! This was such a great surprise. I'm not sure if I'm interpreting this differently but the hop presence is a good addition to the style. Well done."
"D - solid BSDA here by the monks at Rochefort. This might be my favorite of their lineup...I should have bought more of this and less of the 10. This will be one of my standards of the style for comparison's sake."
"medium bodied mouthfeel, medium, slickly prickly carbonation. very drinkable."
"This was a treat and I kinda prefer this compared to the ten, although that is a quad. I could get through two of these no problem. It went very quickly, let's just leave it at that."
"Good to go! Nice complex taste. Good drinker."
"A bit of carbonation. Very drinkable, but would have to stick with just one on a beer topping off at 7%. Lots of complexity, but nothing to be scared away from. A must try."
"Poured into a Leffe glass, light hazy brown with a small bubbly tan head. Lots of floaties in this one. Smell is great, very complex. Ripe fruits, some yeast, a tiny bit of roasty malt and a bit of alcohol. Taste is good, but not what I had expected after the smell. Honestly, kind of bland. Some malt, not a lot of yeast or hop flavor, a bit of caramel in the finish, very dry. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and heavily carbonated, finish is a bit warm. Drinkability is average, not a huge fan of this beer."
"Taste-Spicy caramel,brown sugar,raisins. Dry finish, bubbly and rather light-bodied for the strength. Very interesting and full of character as more flavors emerge: Dark rye bread, pumpernickle, fennel, anise notes, caraway seeds, subtle hop bite that stays in the background. Complex yet not overpowering at all. Take your time and enjoy!"
"Verdict: Even at the lower price-point, I would never choose this over the 10. This is simply not worth the hefty pricetag, although not a bad beer."
"(D) Very drinkable! Mild flavor makes for a great sesson beer that is if price is not an option."
"The first thing that I get in the taste is that it's kind of watery and thin. It was some really nice toffee flavor but it finishes pretty flat with a hint of sweetness. The body is expectedly light and combine that with the lighter flavor makes for an great drinkability in a beer that doesn't hint in the least of its strength."
"D: This didn't blow my mind but it is a wonderful brew none the less. Not as epic as 10, but wonderful just the same. Definitely one of the better BSDA I've had to date."
"jd"
"Overall this is a good beer, not a great beer or worth the expensive price tag in my opinion. This is my first of the 3 Rocheforts so I am expecting better things from the 8 and 10."
"Drinkability is great. A very well done example of a Belgian Strong Dark Ale. It's not as complex as its bigger brothers, but it still a very worthy brew."
"D - Just not as interesting as I had hoped."
"Bottle. The ""littlest"" of the Rochefort at only 7.5% this beauty pours a nice rich cloudy mahogany red color with a nice 2 finger head that settles rather slowly to form a nice coaster. The aroma is somewhat tame compared to the others but still has a nice toffee, caramel sweet smell along with some belgian yeast fruit type notes. Light/medium mouthfeel. Good lace left on the glass. The taste is rather sweet with nice caramel and toffee. Slight spice as well. Ends rather neatly with no real lingering flavors. Having had 10 before I would say this isn't as good by judged by itself it is pretty tasty."
"This is a really good beer. Too bad that they cost $4.75 per bottle or I would be drinking a lot more."
"Overall: My first beer from Rochefort. Not bad. I'm not overly impressed especially for the price. Hopefully the 8 and 10 I have are better."
"D: With good flavors and great aroma, this is an all around good Trappist package"
"Hazy, light brown. Sediment standard for bottle conditioned Belgian ale. Carbonation going crazy on the pour and while yeast settles. Activity on the surface is transfixing - head gone quickly but there's something happening still... Smell is fruit, caramel, and, with the visible particles of yeast floating about, bready in nature. Taste is complex, malty and slightly sour at the outset. Tiny bit of hops bitterness at the back. Carbonation higher, alcohol taste lower than it's 8 and 10 cousins. Medium/heavy body with a sweet, dry finish. One will be quite satisfying."
"D - Great drinkability. So complex yet it finished so clean and dry. I could put down several of these in a sitting if it weren't so damn expensive."
"It has a bit more of a caramel taste to it, and less of the breadlike quality of the 10."
"Mouthfeel is a bit bubbly but overall pretty smooth. In the end, it's a solid beer from one of the best. Some may say its too light to be a Strong Dark Ale, but I don't think the monks care."
"Ruby brown in color, mostly opaque. Lots of cream-colored head and plenty of carbonation. Aroma of raisin, dark cherry, grape - very wine-like with good maltiness. Sweet cherry flavors, raisin, a bit of bread. A bit of spiciness from the yeast. Very estery overall. Mostly full body, quite sweet and verging on cloying at times. Pretty warm on the back with a slightly malty aftertaste."
"D- The carbonation is a bit too much for me, but I really liked the taste"
"This is a real pleasure to drink. I find it overall very inviting and mellow, nothing offensive or all that challenging to this, just very well done. A beer to contemplate how sweet life can be."
"If you could drink alcoholic liquified bread, then why not? The main reason for me is that there is a slightly more expensive version of this - Rochefort 8 - and the small savings for a bottle of 6 doesn't justify the still high price."
"Pours a murky red brown with a nice head that dissipates to something spotty. Has a sweet, slightly fruity smell like prunes. The smell is not very heavy on yeast or hops. The mouthfeel is nice with slight carbonation. The alcohol is hidden well. The taste is ok. I think it's what I expected with a slight sweetiness of dark fruits like raisins and a barely noticeable warmth. However, it seems to be missing the taste of beer in that I can hardly taste the yeast and malted grains. All in all, I really like this beer."
"Gentlemen, meet the monk's session beer. And it's still 7.5 percent. Damn."
"Dark brownish-orange in color, with a decently-thick and frothy medium-beige head (two fingers). Head appeared ""splotchy"" on top, with portions appearing a darker beige. The nose was very subtle, with hints of dried fruit and the taste was similar with a touch of malt. The finish was very pronounced, with hints of more fruit, malts and possibly caramel. Mouthfeel starts great, a light-to-medium body with a cool carbonation that tingles on your lips. No lacing and head continues to dissipate. Drink ends hot, and with a good amount of sediment. Drinkability is questionable vis-a-vis price point, availability and overall appreciation; would drink again if it was purchased for me."
"D - Very nice beer that is strong but extremely drinkable. Session beer, probably not but this is a beer that I could drink 3-4 pretty easily. Some of the best beer in the world!"
"Pours a hazy amber brown colour with bubbly off-white head. The head dissipates fairly quickly with some spotty lacing. Smells of all sorts of fruit, I think I get apple and raisins being the most apparent. Quite a sweet taste, but a little bit tart in the aftertaste. Nice carbonation level. I preferred the other 2 Rochefort's, but this is still really nice."
"Drinkability: This beer is not one of the best Trappist beers available, but is definitely better than the Rochefort 8, which I had tasted a few days ago. This beer is much more rounded than that one, but is basically the same thing with less on an alcohol punch. Not the best Trappist brew I've had, but still a very enjoyable beer overall."
"Overall an excellent beer but not quite as wonderful as their 8 and 10."
"D - This beer went down way too easy. It's a battle to force yourself to take it slow, but a very worthwhile one as this beer really develops as it opens up and settles."
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied, maybe even a little below. Carbonation is high and feels very bubbly at first, but it smooths out a bit as it warms. Drinkability is good, I really liked it and it was a great choice to drink after dinner tonight. It was very flavorful and at the same time not as heavy as their other offerings."
"M: Smooth & very rich but not creamy,"
"D- Really tasty with a strong kick to it. Reviewing my notes makes me want one right now...too bad it's Sunday and no beer for us here in GA :(."
"D: As said, quite drinkable for a BSDA. Not as rewarding as the 10, but still a damned fine beer."
"D: As much as I adore the Rochefort 10, this may be the abbey's best beer. It's well-balanced, accessible, delicious, and light enough to drink several. Highly recommended!"
"Tasted from 11.2oz bottle from Famous in Lombard. Pours cloudy brown with a thick but quickly receding white head. The nose is slightly fruity with some cola notes and light caramel malt. It is also slightly oxidized. The flavors are peach, cola, nuttiness, and caramel. The body is light with medium carbonation, and a medium nutty cola finish."
"Notes: Almost unfair bias; tasted alongside a Rockefort 8 and Chimay Premiere."
"Pours a murky reddish brown with fizzy off-white head. Smell: nutty, a little brown sugar and raisin. Pretty laid back. Taste: a little date, nutty, unfiltered apple juice. Feel: the big problem here is that it's over-cabonated, almost a seltzer feel. This was a disappointment, and not old by any means. Best by code: 04-11-14 == bottled on 11/4/2009."
"This is definitely one of my all time favorite beers."
"If you can get this beer where you live drink it, another great beer from this brewer what more can I say"
"Poured a mahogany brown, off white well retaining head. Smells yeaty and bready with a bit of golden raisin, currant, and apple. Taste has a cola quality to it with slight breadiness to it. Mouthfeel is well carbonated, wet finish. Alcohol is supremely well hidden. I like to have this one around."
"Cheers!"
"Overall, it lacks some of the flavor punch of the other Trappists, but it's also one of the most easy drinking out there."
"Not quite a dessert beer, but very close."
"BOTTLE"
"D: Tasty, lighter version of it's more boozy brothers. Very drinkable, just a little pricey."
"This beer would be fantastic with a good fish, like a salmon or tuna, or fried chicken. If you're a health nut, you might want to dial down to a well-grilled chicken."
"I tried this beer on May 14, 2009 at ""Smokeless Joe's"" in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The beer poured a nice reddish-brown with a thin white head that lingered. The aroma was sweet roasted malt, yeast, caramel and brown sugar. The mouthful was medium to full bodied with medium high carbonation. The flavour was slightly sweet, yeasty, malty, toffee with plums and spice. A very good beer."
"Drinkability is excellent. Outstanding all around. Far better than the 8 or 10 in my opinion."
"O A very good beer and I am glad I bought several. Typical Belgian attention to detail, they really do beer right. This goes in the must try box."
"Wonderful..."
"Of the 6, 8 & 10, this is my 2nd favorite."
"D: easy, probably the quickest belgian ive ever sipped down."
"Very good beer overall. Will most definitely try again."
"Notes: Nice offering from the Rochefort line up. A bit understated but it is quality, reliable, and recommendable."
"A nice enjoyable beer that is easy to drink and has a nice little kick to it. Quite enjoyable and a great example of this style; this is the type of beer to sip and savor or enjoy with some food."
"Notes: Best before 08/07/14. Not really sure what to think about this beer other than I like it. It has a unique almost musty like aroma and taste that was nice, also it isn't really like a BSDA, but I don't know what else to consider it as it is somewhere between light and dark. Overall an enjoyable, drinkable beer that I really did enjoy, what else would you expect from this brewery. Worth trying."
"Served from bottle into a Chimay goblet. Poured a nice dark brown with tons of sediment. Has a three-finger fizzy off-white head that subsides to one finger and maintains a dusting of brown sediment on top throughout. Lacing is minimal throughout. The aroma was comprised of malt, fruit, spices, and alcohol notes. The flavor was of fruit and malt that is very subtle; alcohol hits you upon swallowing, but is not overpowering. It is medium on the palate with high carbonation. Overall, this was a very nice brew that was very easy to drink. However I don't think I could drink a large quantity in one sitting. If it had more lacing and flavors, this brew could be great."
"Creamier mouthfeel than I expected. Was quite fizzy."
"If you can get your hands on one, make sure you grab some!!"
"Look. It's drinkable but that is mostly because it is not as full flavoured as it could be. I don't get the big, rich complexity that is possible in a 7.5% beer. While I don't find this amazing, I do love the 8 and 10 so I suppose I had to not like one of them."
"Very tasty and quite drinkable, though not as impressive as the Rochefort 10 (next up, Rochefort 8...)."
"Overall a nice easy drinker. No mistaking this one for it's bigger and bolder brothers. Solid beer none the less."
"taste is creamy, prunes and other dark fruits, caramel, a bit of spice, some sour malt, and nuts in the background, leaves the mouth somewhat tangy and dry."
"D - Really easy drinker. Fantastic taste, great mouthfeel, smells great...and reasonable ABV."
"07:48"
"D: It's relatively easy to drink and any traces of alcohol are well hidden."
"Good beer, I like it better than the 8. I'll probably pick this one up again."
"Moderate density, smooth, lightly carbonated, near the bottom you'll get the particulate more, but it doesn't detract."
"D: It's only ok for the style."
"This is an exceptional Belgian ale that I've obviously waited way too long to try. Boy, am I excited for the rest of the series!"
"The feel is crisp, clean, and a bit dry. This is one of the lightest BSDAs that I have ever had. Pretty enjoyable overall, the finish has a somewhat creamy quality. The carbonation is phenomenal. The ample carbonation works perfectly with the texture, lending itself to a phenomenal drinking experience."
"I really like the bottle caps on these Rocheforts. The 6 has a red cap with white text and a white 6 in the middle."
"Mouthfeel of a very lightly carbonated light lager, but the abv of a much higher brew. Carbonation is shall I say perfect? Lots of head but carbonated mouthfeel is not nearly as pronounced as it appeared when poured."
"Notes: not quite as good as the 10, but just as good for the style. Really complex and easy to drink."
"Nose esters that give special fruity marked, can think in liquor but also with red fruit. A touch of coffee is also felt but it is discreet. The mouth is in continuity, it offers many berries macerated in taste with a very dry mouth, however. There is also a touch of alcohol and slightly spicy with presence, in addition, some phenols. The finish has a pleasant little bitterness. Not as complex as its big sisters, but perhaps easier to drink."
"Crisp and light taste as well as mouthfeel, due to the high carbonation, I would suppose. Acidic and slightly tart, reminiscent of citrus fruits and sour apples. Light roasted quality with an underlying candy and caramel sweetness. Finishes dry. Very drinkable."
"Poured a 11.2oz bottle into my Chimay chalice. This beer pours a burnt orange with a head that reminds me of a longer lasting fizz from a Sunkist orange pop. Heavy, sticky lacing is left as the beer recedes. The aroma is interesting. Nothing like what I would have expected from a BSDA. Over ripe apples, vanilla, pepper and other spices. Caramel and toffee. Just a little bit of yeasty bread. Almost reminds me more of a Tripel minus the Belgian candy sugar. The flavor isn't as intense as the nose. Sweet toffee comes through right off the bat followed closely by vanilla bean, and toasted grains. Sweet bruised fruits like apple and pears with just a hint of alcohol burn at the very tail of the flavor profile. The mouthfeel is light and crisply carbonated. It's what I expected from a Trappist Brewery. It's a really good beer."
"Mouthfeel is medium with a fizzy, effervescent amount of carbonation."
"I will stick to the 8 or 10"
"Drinkability: I would definitely have this again, Rochefort has yet to fail to deliver. I recommend this to those seeking a mild and non aggressive BSDA, with a barely noticeable 7.5% ABV."
"Problem here was the alcohol aftertaste which severely impacted drinkability. Drinks much bigger than it is. Decent authentic trappist beer but not something I'll pick again. The '10' is a different story :)"
"Light finish and body for the style."
"Reviewed from my notes based upon a 6oz bottle pour served in a small wine glass. Immediately upon the glass being set down in front of me, I am impressed. I can see hues of pink, orange, brown--it's like the colors of an intense sunset all mixed together. It resembles slightly watered down sherry. It has thin off-white bubbles the disappeared as I was trying to describe them. There isn't much lacing or coating if I swirl the beer around. I pick up aromas of plum, powdered sugar, and maybe oak or another wood when I inhale. There are flavors of plum, raisin and some sweet malts. There is a bit of alcohol in the finish, but not as much as you often get with this style. It's very complex. I want to describe the taste as a bit soapy, but I'm not sure if that truly conveys what it tastes like; nevertheless, what I call soapy is a good thing. It has a lighter medium body and just the right amount of carbonation. There isn't much mouth coating. It's a bit watery for me, but only ever so slightly. The 6 is very drinkable. It goes down so easily! It's great as an individual glass, but also would be wonderful over many rounds. It doesn't feel like a 7.5% ABV beverage at all. If you've never had a Trappist beer, this would be a great place to start."
"I WILL try this beer again in the near future to see if my experience is different."
"Drinkability: Incredibly smooth and drinkable for a higher ABV beer. If it wasn't for the steeper price tag, I could enjoy a few of these in an evening."
"High carbonation, just short of excessive. Body is quite light, could be a bit richer."
"Overall, I liked the 10 and the 8 a lot better. This beer just didn't taste like a good BSDA (or I should say I have had better). Probably not going to be getting this again. The mouthfeel was off and the flavor was lacking."
"Poured from an 11.2 oz bottle into a tulip. The second that I opened the bottle, the beer started to flow out. Thankfully I had a glass ready, and got a cloudy amber color with some noticable sediment. Good one finger of dirty tan head, which lingers for a bit before disapearing. Smells aren't as strong as I would like, but yeast and brown sugar sweetness are there. Tastes are of cherries, plums, and belgian yeast. Aftertaste give more spice and alcohol. Mouthfeel is great with a creamy texture, light-medium body, and a medium amount of carbonation. Drinkability of this beer is very good, sweet and creamy without being too heavy. Overall a very nice beer, but of course, this one is going to carry a higher price tag (4.99 for a single)."
"D- A really nice Belgian Strong; fruity and sweet kept in check with phenols and slight tart/sour notes."
"D: A great brew with a delicious spicy, phenol-tinged sweet sugary maltiness. I will definitely revisit this brew again and probably cellar it a little longer than a year with future tries."
"O: Excellent dirinkability. Less complex than the 8 or 10 but still a Rochefort"
"Drinkability: I have to say that I'm not motivated to go out of my way to find this beer again. It is a nice enough beer that I'll probably be trying again to give it another chance. Certainly I'd not turn one down if offered. However, that being said, I think there others I prefer."
"D-this has a nice complexity to it, it has just the right amount of things going on and is very tasty and goes down easily. there is a little off phenol in the taste that detracts slightly from the taste."
"Pours straight up brown, off-white head starts out small and fizzy but numerous carbonation bubbles keep it alive and a little fluffier over time. TONS of sediment floating around in this thing. Smell is fruits and yeast. Taste is sort of tart, I'm tasting mostly lighter fruit with some dark fruit as well. I think this tastes more like a Belgian pale than a dark ale. Someone in another review said ""musty raisins", I think that hits the nail on the head. Lots of Belgian yeast of course and a little warming alcohol. Last few sips are thick with yeast, looks like dirt at the bottom of the glass. I enjoyed it, but I'm hoping for more with the 8."
"Rochefort makes a tremendous beer, and while I prefer #8, #6 is worth a drink."
"Partytime with this one. I have had the very very good 10 of Rochefort and now i am tasting the 6. Not much carbonation in this one so the broken white head dissapears after a short while. A very smooth beer which is very drinkable. A nice brown colour and if you want to try a Belgian beer without being dissapointed you will have to buy this one."
"D: Excellent drinkablity. Rochefort 6's balance of flavors, excellent carbonation, and smooth finish make this a recommendation for a beginner's Belgium beer. I'd recommend this brew to the novice all the way up to the champions of beer. If you like this brew and want something bigger, bolder, and much more stunning go for the 10, you wont be disappointed."
"Overall it's a very good beer but it is certainly light. In fact too light to really enjoy all of the flavors. I'd take a Rochefort 8 over this anyday but I could certainly drink this all night."
"D: I think the beer style for this one is wrong because this is a perfect double. I would love this to be my go to beer it is highly drinkable could drink 4 with ease, unfortunately at 5 bucks a bottle that will not happen. So when I reach for a rochfort it will be the 8 or 10 due to the fact one is satisfying. this is one of the best doubles I have ever had had It is better than Chimay rouge. too bad it's so expensive."
"Drinkability: tasty and creamy; overall a good experience which I just know could be a little better."
"If it were cheaper, it would be a regular in my rotation of BSDA's."
"Not bad but I prefer Rochefort 8 and 10 over this for a few reasons. They're both easier to enjoy and deceptively drinkable. I can't quite say the same for this."
"Appears very dark. Cannot see through at all. Semi aggressive pour results in a very good head that holds up a finger thick even in the wide snifter. Smells of fruit, mostly cherry and some raison...even a little hint of spice. The taste is very good. Just enough sweetness for an evening beer. A lot of malt flavor and little to no hop presence is detected. This is not a heavy beer for dark Belgian ale; and as such is one of the more drinkable I've tried."
"Very carbonated and light in the mouth. I taste a sort of banana-like quality up front. A lot of spiciness, bit of grape. Very tangy, but also refreshing."
"Good beer. Can't say much more than that, just have one. Pleasure to drink."
"Feel is good, small bubbles provides a creamy and soft carbonation that is really pleasant."
"drinkability: overall its a nice belgian ale, but not over top like I thought it could be."
"The mouthfeel is a bit thinner than I would like but finishes nice and dry. High carbonation leads to high drinkability. Very good beer, recommended."
"D- Smooth yet warm. The alcohol shows in this one. Its a really good warming sipper from one of the best Belgian abbey breweries."
"The nose is yeasty with caramel and a mildly bready character. Brown sugar, a touch of earthy spice, this is quite delicate but also underwhelming. The palate fares no better. Opening quite yeasty and very delicate with brown sugar sweetness. Bready and caramel-like, the flavors in this beer are very understated. Light in body, high in carbonation, the finish is decent with yeasty and spicy character. This is not particularly impressive, while I had no problem drinking this, I'm not enjoying this too much. Nonetheless, I will buy this again to figure out exactly how wrong I am."
"This was my first from Rochefort, and it was good - although not my favorite of the trappists so far."
"D- This brew has it all from the looks to the mouthfeel. This was hard to drink slowly."
"D: easy to drink, smooth and the alcohol does not hit you until you throw down 4 or 5 lol"
"Notes: If it wasn't for this beer's price and limited availability I'd never be without it, highly reccomended."
"Overall, outstanding beer. I'd highly suggest this to you and yours. Here's to another beer. Cheers."
"Drinkability: I love the buttery fruit combo. I could have several of these. The alcohol is very well hidden. This may be my new favorite in the style."
"M/D: Light bodied, good carbonation, but a dry feeling in the palate. Enjoyed this beers smell and taste, m/d slightly lacking."
"drinkability is crazy - @3.75 years old the alcohol is undetecable - i could sip on these all day long"
"Drinkability is good. A great tasting beer very well hidden for a 7.5% ABV. I think I have found a new favorite."
"A simply outstanding beer can't say much more than that, amazing."
"D: A great balanced beer - great to drink by itself, or I could see pairing this one with some lighter fare."
"Drinkability: pretty good brew."
"the finish is a med. body with tingly carbonation bouncing along the sides of the tongue while the dulled down sweetness lingers with the dry finish. this is a very interesting beer and considerably different from it 8 and 10 counterparts. this was a great beer to get your hands on and well worth the search."
"D - This stuff is excellent I wish it was available in Texas because this would be a semi regular purchase worth finding to try"
"D - Higher ABV."
"Dark and clear amber color with a light tan head. Aroma of caramel, nuts and raisins. Flavor of dates, malt, dark cherries and vanilla. A slightly sweeter and less complex version of the 8, nonetheless very nice flavor and reasonable complexity. Should age well."
"D= not too shabby at all. Great for a slower easier drinking night."
"- Overall very good, but doesn't touch the 8 and 10. It is however very close to the 8..."
"Medium bodied with a hard carbonation"
"Feel is pleasant as the carbonation is firm and resilient. If a good swirl yields a flat spot, then the fruity sweetness that results is light on the tongue. Fairly drinkable. No obvious flaws yet no great compexities."
"The color was extremely dark, reminded me of a strong black tea. Smelled very fruity and full of citrus. Nice, not to overpowering, spicy flavors with a hint of semi-sweet chocolate. I also got some apples and bananas at the finish. Very full-bodied beer but have a nice creamy finish."
"Bottom line - Doesn't compare to the 8 or the wold-class 10. It was worth a try, but if I'm going to spend the money on a Rochefort, it's going to be a 10 from now on."
"Cheers!!!"
"I don't typically like Belgian beer because they tend to have so much of that strong raisin kind of flavor that usually turns me off. Here suddenly that became interesting to me."
"Mouthfeel is deferent. Less fruity then the nose. Figs and caramel. Carbonation is a perfect representation of the opening, high, almost fizzy, but this tends to fade in after a few minutes."
"A capped 11.2 ounce bottle poured into my basic tulip glass. Appears a cloudy chestnut color with about an inch of dense light rust colored foam. Nice retention. Flavors and aromas consist of prunes, raisins, molasses, bruised apples, sweet malts, spices, yeast. Nearly full bodied for the style with ample carbonation. Little to no alcohol heat. Tasty and complex."
"This beer is unique, to say the least. Based on the aroma, I thought this would have been my favorite of the three Rochefort beers. Its a decent tasting beer, but there are some flavors that don't mesh well. Overall, I think the 8 is the best. Got the best flavor balance without tasting too much like a fine wine. I would recommend it, but just don't expect it to match up to the 8 or 10."
"Drinkability: Like the two stronger ales from the monks, this is brilliantly balanced, and drinkable. This is probably more drinkable than the other two with the lower ABV. Brilliant."
"Drinkability is good, the most approachable of the Rochefort line up. However, the lesser complexity makes the phenols a bit heavy."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a decent bite of carbonation."
"Cheers!"
"Although this beer pales in comparison to the 10 and 8, this is still a very, very solid beer from Rochefort. Wouldn't hesitate to order this beer in a minute. Impressive."
"see my 8 and 10 review!"
"Not my favorite; this deserves a revisit someday."
"D - Very drinkable for the style, which surely has something to do with the lower ABV. At the same time, in comparison to style, I've had other Belgian darks that were better. While I'm willing to give their line-up a retry, I just wanted to include a note regarding the fact that the Rochefort line didn't impress me all that much. They're good, but nothing mind-blowing."
"Jordan."
"Update feb 2010: I would add that the beer has plenty of carbonation, a good bit of yeastiness, the head has a slightly foamy and fizzy head. The nose is quite nice, subtle, but still nice. I would add points here. There are some definite phenols in this beer, lots of prickly mouthfeel, a slightly sourish fig or raisiny flavor too."
"D - The drinkability is pretty good, not a beer I would drink often but an occasional dark belgian perhaps, I think it is very nicely nuanced and the abv is not noticeable to me."
"Overall a great Trappist ale, I'm split between this and the 8 coming out of Rochefort being my favorite. Great brewery, great beer."
"Follow-up (9/2010): A year later, opened one of my cellared bottles. It improved significantly (--> more complexity and depth) in just about every category. Lots more distinctive earthy/fruit notes on both the nose and the tongue. Definitely one for the cellar!"
"D: I really like it if a beers from the same brewery are not a top-down dilution from their strongest delivery. This Rochefort 6 stays clearly on it's own when compared to the 8 and 10. Simply GREAT!!!"
"Pours a hazy brown, with a huge tan head that overflows the glass. Smell is of solvent alcohol and chocolate. Taste is bready, tea-like, with a hint of smoke. A hint of tartness in the finish. Low hop bitterness. Mouthfeel is rich, low, smooth carbonation. Drinks below its 7.5% abv, hides its alcohol well. A very good beer, though quite pricey at $5 for a 11.2oz bottle, I probably wont have this too often."
"D: This was a pretty damn good Belgian Strong Ale. Fits all the characteristics for the style, but is a bit on the lighter end. Not quite as complex and flavorful as the 8 and 10, but who expects it to be? Definitely a more ""sessionable"" strong ale, with its subtle flavors and light body. I'll have this again, hopefully in a vertical tasting with the 6 then the 8 then the 10."
"D: easy to drink, smooth and the alcohol does not hit you until you throw down 4 or 5 lol"
"Sweet, chalky dry aftertaste that leaves you wanting more. This is up there with some of the best beers i've had. Thank you Jebus."
"Drinkable, but I made the mistake of serving too cold. Took awhile to warm up so I could smell and taste it. Even so, I had a hard time picking out much in both categories. I'll have to try this again, and give it another chance. But I suppose that maybe it's just not for me, despite it's reputation."
"A very well rounded Belgian Dark Ale. Complex, warming and inviting."
"A brown body with good tan head, with lace running down the glass. A good sweet malt smell along with some minor fruity hops. A puckering sweetness in the medium-body with some breadiness as well for balance, as this is a sweet Belgian that finishes dry and has hints of hops bitterness on the end as well as dark fruits. Classic Belgian that anyone should try."
"Very smooth, a nice sharp flavor thats quite malty, lingers for a bit. Very bready and spicy on the way down. Kind of a light body but good for the style."
"D - Rich and malty, this is a nice, drinkable dubble. The yeast profile is a bit dull, but the malt, especially in the finish makes up for it."
"Cheers."
"I'd love to try this beer iover in belgium I'm sure it would be very different."
"This one pours a nice reddish-brown hue with ample foamy off-white head that retains well and eventually settles into about an 1/8 inch man-hole cover over my beer. It smells of dark fruit and breaded malts. Tastes a little bit of figs but mostly of dark fruit with an underlying sweetness that I'm unsure how I feel about. Probably just because what I've been eating today. It drinks surprisingly well."
"Poured into becher glass, huge tall head that dissipates mildy into a great lace. Tastes of chocolatey cream with malts, spice, dark fruits, raison and cocoa - mainly cocoa. A little yeasty with sediment at bottom and medium carbonation. Awesome beer"
"D: Trappist is the ""beer-family"" I like the best. This is a fantastic beer, but far from the best trappist-beers."
"Pours a reddish brown color with a 3+ finger tan foamy head which has a sticky lace. Has the aroma of bread, malt, spice, and dark fruit. The taste matches the smell, is sweet, but not overly sweet. Is nicely made. Light bodied with fizzy carbonation. Very drinkable, not overly sweet, but very easy to drink. The 7.5 % alcohol is well hidden."
"Mouthfeel is great and you can drink as much of this as you want."
"Again, a very, very good beer. This is the one that is produced the least (with regard to the 8 and the 10) so some retailers tend to charge more than the 8. I'm glad I tried it; however given the chance to have this or the 8, I'd take the 8 every time. My anticipation for the 10 is now even greater."
"D: The world of Belgians is sort of a new thing to me, but it would seem I'm off to a good start. A very nice beer, indeed."
"11.2oz bottle. Pours an incredibly hazy mahogany with a large, light tan head and a fair amount of sediment. Smells of dark malt and milk chocolate, cassis, some spiciness, and later some light sour notes. The taste is heavy on dark fruits; raisin in particular. Definite dark malt/cocoa presence again, but it's far from overly sweet. Classic Rochefort yeast at the end. Very slightly warming, though there's no apparent alcohol. Complex. Medium, creamy body with high carbonation. Very drinkable for what it is. It's a shame this one gets overshadowed by the two others."
"Definately worth trying this interesting abbey ale- I bought a few because they are apparently hard to find and will put them away for a while to see how they age."
"AFTERMATH. Love it with carrot cake, or perhaps a cinnamon-based dessert. Caramelized pears. Fuhgedibowdit."
"Thick headed initially with quickly dissolving having the same coloring as fresh apple cider. Smell is soft sort of a blend of fruit and hops. Taste is spicy grape. Feels tart like a cider. Pretty drinkable, but considering it was made by belgian Monks what else would you expect?"
"D Very good - strong and I know if I were offered it I would not turn this down defanite sipper though."
"D - Great stuff, very impressed by the least produced and most overlooked line of the Rochefort brews. ""6" achieves a level of complexity and uniqueness not seen by many beers, even from the other big Belgian guys. A pleasant surprise."
"This was my first 6. I have had the 8 and 10 numerous times and enjoyed this one as much. A great beer that has its own unique character"
"D- A complex, enjoyable beer. The alcohol is well hidden. Overall, this is decent, but not the stand out from this brewery."
"Overall this was a beer for drinking slowly - you savor and enjoy. It does need some food to go with it though - by itself its maybe too much. Still, it was a good choice for watching a movie and slowly drinking the beer over the course of the film."
"The balance is entirely towards the malt thus the beer is generally sweet on the palate, with mouldy notes and flavors of dark fruits listed in the aroma section.The sweetness is counterbalanced by warming alcohol and the finish is typically dry for a trappist version of BSDA. Medium-light bodied and effervescent. (330 ml, BB date 09-09-2014, into tulip)"
"You learn new things, everyday."
"OVERALL: Decent brew, but the palate was a definite let down, which also hurts its drinkability. The color is a little off putting as well. Like the eight, the six is not nearly as impressive as the greatly superior Roch 10. Unfortunately, this one is probably a bit more about hype than the brew itself."
"Pours a fairly sizable head with a fine brown body. Smells a little sour, but there is also a considerable degree of fruitiness too. There are hints of orange mostly. The taste also has a degree of orange fruitiness to it as well, but is then overshadowed by the presence of chocolate and caramel. This beer is extremely smooth and very agreeable. For a Belgian Strong Ale it wasn't too overpowering, which makes it possible to simply enjoy the taste without having to worry about the high alcohol content."
"Conclusion: Damn good Belgian Strong Dark; not perfect, but quite tasty."
"Not bad at all - quite enjoyable...but I do like the Rock 10 a whole lot better."
"This poured a nearly opaque mahogany with huge chucks of sediment and fluffy light tan head. It smelled like earthy caramel and bready yeast, with some lemon hops and salt and alcohol. It tasted like rich milk chocolate and nutty malt, with sweet creamy yeast and a bit of lemon and lingering caramel. It was watery with tons of carbonation and a sweet aftertaste. Overall this wasn't highly complex like some Trappist ales can be, but it had a great clean and delicate flavor. It was surprisingly malty without much of the traditional sour wild yeast taste. It also hid the alcohol very well, making this all too easy to drink. My only complaint is that it was a bit too carbonated for my liking, probably due to all the yeast sediment. But the fizziness smoothed out about half way through the glass. I didn't expect too much from this beer, since it's the ""lowest"" of the Rocheforts, but I was very pleasantly surprised. This is simply a fantastic beer."
"Overall this is a very good beer that solidifies Rochefort as my favorite easily accessible Trappist brewery. Definitely worth a shot."
"D: I haven't tried the rochefort 8 or 10, but the six makes me want to. I was impressed with the beer and wouldn't mind having a few more"
"330 ml bottle into chalice. Cloudy amber with lots of flaky ""stuff"" floating around. Malty aroma. Lots of carbonation in pour, large head dimishing to minimal. No lingering lacing. Alcohol taste in finish. Flavorful, enjoyable as it warms. Probably begain with first sip at around 50 degrees, finishing closer to 60. So, do I swallow the last ounce, with all that crap, or rinse? Cheers to my first Roche!"
"Definitely a stellar beer, but not quite on par with the 8 and the 10."
"Would love to have more than the one I've got, though."
"D: A good sipper. Quite a bit lighter than the 8 or the 10."
"Not sure if I prefer this to Chimay Red, but not having them side by side they're both extremely similar. My guess is the Chimay Red is slightly better due to its increased sweetness (for me personally) but I really liked this beer. Too bad we can't get it in Texas."
"Drinkability:this beer says fall to me, i like rochefort i like what they have done with the trappist style but my favorite still is rochefort 8 .Although don`t get me wrong this is a very good beer.cheers."
"The taste is vague winey-fruity with tanginess and a fleeting hint of Hershey's chocolate, but otherwise thin, one-dimensional, and bland, bland, bland. This is about as boring a beer as I have ever had."
"A fanastic beer and I look forward to trying again. The ABV is hidden extremely well along with so much going on flavor-wise; a palate experience."
"Drinkability: This is a very solid beer. Perfectly Belgian, with those slight phenols, yeasty esters, fruit notes, malt notes ... hits all the right notes, really. At 7.5%, it's not undrinkable, and it's not even really that high for the style, so that's a good thing. This is the last of the Rochefort's for me to try, and though it's not as good as either of the others in my opinion, it's still a very solid Belgian brew."
"This one is good, but a bit simple I would say. Overall, definitely not up to the R8. A good quality belgian that I would not mind drinking in the future. Just falls short of the 8 (haven't had the 10 yet)."
"Into a Rochefort goblet, deeb red bordering on ruby, small light tan head that faded quickly leaving behind very light lacing. Aroma of light chocolate, fruitiness, raisins, slightly earthy. Flavor is much lighter compared the other Rochies, notes of cola, apple, dark fruit and light citrus, slightly herbal and grassy, makes for excellent belches. Body is slightly thin, but the carbonation's not as big as the others keeping it from becoming too crisp. This is a very nice beer, not quite as good as 8, but tasty indeed."
"D: good drinkability for its strength."
"11.2 oz bottle poured into a goblet. Rather light color for the style. Hazy pumpkin orange instead of the traditional medium brown. Nice beige head leaves gobs of lace. Aroma is essentially a fruit basket. Grapes, pears, apples, figs, dates. Flavor contains many of the same notes but also a caramel maltiness, lots of yeast, and some alcohol. Mouthfeel is very effervescent, which makes it hard to drink until the beer has breathed for several minutes."
"If you see it buy it. Seek out."
"Two thumbs up here. Excellent drinkability for a Trappist."
"I've failed yet to mention perhaps its finest quality, which is that, quite simply, Rochefort 6 is a very pleasant drinking ale. Its fruity esters and phenolic yeast blend so well into a mellowed cast of creme caramel and figgy pudding flavours. It is gentle on the palate and low enough in alcohol to still be considered refreshing. Whether before, during, or perhaps even after a meal, this drink provides a wonderful option."
"5 M&4.5 D: I find myself short of words to be able to describe what's happening on my palate, as it's so different from 99% of all other Belgian dark ales I've tried. It's complex, full of excitement, delicious but dry, yet utterly creamy smooth on the mouthfeel... The dry-ish edge at the back is a huge plus, if not THE key, to the success of the flavour and palate. Simply put, this is a distinctive ale like no other. I'll try to find another bottle and also enlighten myself a bit with dictionaries before re-reviewing it in due course~~"
"D- This is pretty drinkable beer but not the best belgian strong dark by any means."
"Wow, I was surprised by how different this brew was as compared to the others in the family... This one was much smoother and quite frankly much tastier... I didn't detect any booze at all in this...it was more like drinking a big glass of a sweet wheat bread smothered in honey and it was delicious... I was surprised at the mellowness of the brew... It was a perfect nightcap... Highly recommended...."
"Dinkability is sufficient, though I much prefer the other rocheforts."
"11.2oz bottle - 060213 12:52 indicated on the bottle. Served in my Chimay goblet at 50 degrees. Gushed off the cap pop before pouring a hazy purplish brown with a vigorous, one inch off-white head which reduced its volume by half in less than a minute before settling into a solid, quarter inch cap. Some arcs of belgian lacing exposed during the tasting with decent legs. Tiny particles evident floating in the brew. Nose was vinous - dark fruit and some yeast. Taste consistent with nose - detected some candi sugar and dark fruit is somewhat muted; slightly herbal/medicinal quality detected at the finish. Mouthfeel fell between light- and medium-bodied and very effervescent (somewhat prickly). Alcohol was well-hidden. I have to say that I was a little dissapointed with this beer. Decent, but I've had better, particularly for the dollar value."
"D: An enjoyable brew with complex tastes. But nothing particularly exciting, as I've tasted some comparable greats from American brewers. Not sure it's worth the cost to get this again."
"Nicely complex with multiple flavors that work so well with each other. Smooth, slightly dry finish that just adds to my love of this lineup. Wonderfully crisp with a hint of sharp carbonation. Fantastic."
"D: An all around solid beer, classic Belgian, you can't go wrong."
"Drinkability: A reasonably complex, enjoyable brew, though, for my tastes, the carbonation was just a bit too high."
"Mouthfeel varies - watery at times, creamy at others, with an understated carbonation that fits well. Excellent beer, but 10 is still my favorite of the trio."
"M/D - nicely flavored and carbonated, a very nice beer to try. I definitely recommend trying it."
"Overall a very good beer, but not mind blowing. Much better than the 8; now it's on to the 10."
"Taste: Caramel, dark fruits, yeasty and breadlike. Little bit of alcohol in the finish."
"Drinkability/mouthfeel: Medium carbonation and a bit fizzy on the tongue. Feels a bit like champagne. Good overall but I have had the 8 and the 10 before I tried this one so it would be my least favorite of the three Rochefort beers"
"Notes: Great, another trapist success to say the least, although the 8 and 10 are just worlds away."
"Chestnut body with a thick, loose head that persists for a very long time. Aroma of heavily caramelized sugars, molasses, and a touch of bannana. Flavor mimics the aroma, but with a bit of alcohol and a decent malt note. Mouthfeel is decent, but a little too agressive for my preference. Drinkability also good, but not something I drink regularly. Too many burps from the carbonation. Drank this in honor of Pittsburgh's sixth Super Bowl victory. Then realized I hadn't ever reviewed it and drank another. :)"
"MF&D - the carbonation is good and big, though one would never guess that from the look of the glass, as yeast has clogged the carbon scoring at the bottom. the feel is a bit light, not enough viscosity in my opinion. this lets the beer be consumed very easily, once the head settles down!"
"Pours a dark amber and cloudy color. One inch head with decent retention and slight lacing. Smells slightly of alcohol, some hops, dark malts, and slight fruity aroma. Fits the style of a Belgian Strong Dark Ale. Smooth and slightly thick mouth feel. The bitterness is quite noticeable. There's an average carbonation level present. Tastes of alcohol, some fruit, and strong dark malt. The hops aren't there as far as a flavor, but the bitterness is present. There is an interesting chalk-like flavor and an associated acidic tartness that is hard to define. These lower the drinkability, but add a complexity to the flavor."
"The Rochefort 6 is the little brother in a family of world-class beers. I would have a hard time turning down a glass of this or any of its siblings."
"My somewhat smoke-burnt taste buds often demand a bigger beer than this. I had the Rocheforte 10 once and remember it being a lot more inspirational than the 6. As a devotee of our brewing Brothers' fine craftsmanship it's hard not to like this but honestly, there are other Belgians that I prefer. In fairness, they are different styles and this is the first Belgian Strong Dark Ale I have reviewed."
"Its effervescence is a delight in the mouth and makes this Trappist a delicate drink and worthy of a second."
"Beer is light, dry and highly carbonated. There is a light brown nuttiness as well as just the right amounts of body and fruit character to buffer. This is a light and crisp Belgian with session potential, it is not overly complex and the easy drinkability scores high with me but there could be less carbonation."
"I wish these beers came in 750s. I have a 10 to try waiting in the beer fridge."
"Prior this, the only trappist brew I had ever had was Orval, which I found to be too funky. I was hesitant to try other, but I took a chance. After trying all of Westmalle's stuff, Rochefort's stuff, two Chimay's, and all of Koningshoeven's ales, this is definitely my favorite trappist brew. All around, it's an amazing beer."
"The complex flavor and finish generated more character and was as much of a standout for style."
"Pours dark copper colour with thick bubbly off-white head. Smell - caramel, bread, malts. Taste - yeasty, malty, alcohol slightly shows up. Mouthfeel - thick and rich, pretty creamy. It's kinda drinkable. Not a bad stuff, but I liked No8 way better than this."
"Very enjoyable beer."
"Got a couple bottles of these for Christmas. This one pours a deep copper brown color, with a bunch of floaties. Huge fluffy tan head that leaves excellent lacing (with a sprinkle of dark yeast tossed on top for good measure). Nose is strong breadiness, cookies, a touch of fruit, sweet candy malt, spiciness, and a touch of alcohol. A very sweet brew. Flavor is similar. Toffee, cookies. Definite spicy alcohol presence. A touch of unique earthy wood. Candy and caramel sweetness. Almost no hop presence. Definitely subtler than other Rocheforts. Body is a little thinner than expected. Carbonation was good and appropriate. Overall, it's solid, but not nearly as good as the other Rocheforts. I'm not even sure it counts as a BSDA. I'm going to put the other bottle down for a while and see how it does in a year or two..."
"Overall, hands down one of the best tasting beers I have ever had. I was so close to giving this a perfect 5. I was told that this beer was discovered in the brewpubs basement, what a find! I urge anyone who has the chance to buy this beer to have the patience to let this age for 4-5 years. Trust me, you will not be disappointed."
"D - This is probably the best Belgian I've tried. Not too heavy on the palate and not too big on the ABV to have 2 or 3."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied.Spikes with a warm finish and a tart-rather than sweet raisin BSDA flavor. This is a distinctly different beer than the 8, and superbly executed. I look foward to the 10."
"I seem to be getting a lot of alcohol in this beer. It is over 7%, though I have had much higher that hid the alcohol much better (including Rochefort 8). This is very interesting though. Different than other beers of this style. I like it, but it is not my favorite of the style."
"Drinkability: Good, would be great with some cheese or other fatty food to balance the acidity. On the lighter end of the BSDA spectrum, possibly another category - lacks the darker, heavier wow factor of others."
"Bread on the opening, slightly nutty, and a bit of booze, the yeast is what is really on display here and one could imagine that like a gueze, each bottle might bring with it an entirely different world of tastes. This one's focus seems to be a mixture of nutty and crusty bread tones, almost exactly as it is laid out in the nose minus the slightly boozy heat that accompanies the finish on this one. Mouthfeel is what is probably most redeeming about this beer, the active carbonation keeps me interested in trying to pull apart as much flavor as I can out of this beer. But overall I am sort of disappointed in this beer, the complexity that I have come to expect from this style is just not there, I would probably give this beer another try to see if two bottles are alike, but really only if it were on sale or got as an extra or maybe at a bar."
"8/5/8/4/16 (4.1/5)"
"Taste is dark fruit like grapes, plums or dark cherries. Some hops and spice in the back ground. Not quite complex enough for the style. Mouth feel is good and alcohol is not overwhelming."
"I would recommend this beer to anyone who likes dark belgian beers but there are many that are more affordable yet just as good as this one."
"Can't really stand up to its cousins, 8 and 10, but was still a tasty beer. Pours murky mahogany with a thick, short tan head. Cherries, molasses, sugar, and raisins in the nose. Smooth mouthfeel without the expected syrupyness. Malt, caramel, prunes, maple syrup, and cream soda (nice call Beerlando) in the taste. I don't really like a lot of dubbles, as they are typically over-indulgent in spice and sticky malt, but this was really good."
"D: Not really a refreshing beer, not heavy by any means just feels a little too zingy on the tongue. It is pretty tasty though if you're a fig fan."
"Dark amber in color with a decent head that fades quickly. It smells like dark chocolate, and tastes malty with the characteristic toffee/dark fruit flavors. Smooth with a medium body. Predictably, another great beer from Rochefort."
"Pours a copper color with a light tan head. In the aroma,roasted malts and candy sugars, musty and dusty yeast, light caramel, cocoa/vanilla and a slight nuttiness with a hint of toasted marshmallow.In the taste, malty but not very sweet, and somewhat fruity. A small hop and medium bodied mouthfeel, with just a little dryness and touch of fruit in the aftetaste. Quite easy to drink and fantastic."
"My least favorite of the three Rochefort beers, but still a great beer. The same recipe is used for all three but the lower abv lessens the taste a bit by losing the warmth and roasted maltiness. Still pours a nice chocolate brown color with thin tan foam head. Aroma of roasted maltiness and chocolate. Roasted malty flavor with hints of chocolate, toffee and dark fruit."
"D: High marks for drinkability, making for a sweet, rich desert type of beer that you wish you could enjoy more often. Very drinkable."
"I'd say this is a very smooth and drinkable BSDA that's low on the phenolic characteristics. Well rounded and complex. Recommended."
"The Rochefort 8 is my favorite of the 6, 8 and 10 by a longshot."
"D- How could you NOT drink this beer. Maybe if you couldn't afford it...which isn't unlikely, because at my local supplier...it's nearly $7.00 for 11.2 oz, but that is to be expected from a beer such as this."
"D - Not so much for me. I will move on pretty quickly from this one. Nice carbonation and certainly enjoyable, just not my cup of tea."
"Mmmm."
"I'd drink it again."
"D - Good but to expensive to enjoy regularly, better as it warms up"
"D: Not such a warming alcohol, not as much of a 'sipper' as its bigger brothers. Nonetheless, it has enough to pack a little punch... it just hides it well."
"To me this a was a very excellent beer and probably my favorite out of the 6, 8, and 10, something was missing though that would have made this great, but overall I would definately buy more of this."
"11.2 ounce bottle, pours dark, murky, plum. super retentive darker tan head, spots of lace and scattered sheeting, ripe fruit and must in the nose. Soft on the tongue, loads of complex flavors inter mingle here. Fruits, figs, grapes, berries, vanilla, must, light smoke, leather, wood, earthy. A very nice treat, I'd like to pair this one with some old cheese and perhaps spiced meats. Well worth a try."
"Drinkability: Quite smooth and easy to drink. I could go for another at the moment."
"D = A very pleasant Belgian dark ale, not to over the top, very well balanced, A great drink."
"Overall, I was so ready to love this beer. How disappointing."
"Notes: cannot help but compare this with Rochefort 8, 10. I certainly prefer the 8 but all three of these are world class in my opinion. Also: I read somewhere that the Rochefort 6 is ""not as available"" as the 8 and the 10. I bought this bottle at Winking Lizard in Mentor, Ohio (a local chain of beer/sports bars/restaurants)."
"Rich roasted malt with an amazing caramel and toffee layer that is simply awesome. Burn of alcohol seems to be well hidden. This stuff is like candy but yet it isn't cloying. The one drawback is that I think that majority of alcohol has ended up on the bottom of the glass. I swirled it gently to try and mix it up but still it seemed to be futile. I experienced this same thing once before with Chimay, I am not sure if it is due to the shipping or if it had been sitting on the shelf for a long time or if I just didn't pour it hard enough. Despite this it is still a top notch beer. I was expecting it to be like Maudite, but it seemes more mellow. Quite enjoyable."
"Overall pretty good. Not quite what I was expecting, but still very good."
"A tasty & rich Belgian dark ale."
"At this strength, this is one insidious beer."
"Nice, but I am glad I didn't buy more than two bottles considering the price."
"This is a well-made concoction. Went amazing with mussels, had the cleansing texture that worked beautifully."
"An excellent drink."
"This is a good beer, but compared to the other Rochefort beers quite pointless. They are some of my absolute favourites, so..."
"Pours a dark cola color with a big light tan head. Smells of figs and other fruit. Tastes of a very light combination of figs, cherries, cola, but was easily overwhelmed by food. Pleasant and very drinkable, but overall a bit delicate for my tastes. Just not assertive enough."
"This beer pours a hazy, murky brownish color topped with a thick soapy off-white head. It gives off a soothing fruity (apricot?) aroma with subtle malts. Nothing over-powering but nice. This one is easy drinking with a smooth slightly sweet flavor that consists of dark fruits (plums) and some malts. Semi-tart flavor in there after you taste the fruits but again, this is smooth and doesn't taste strong at all. As the beer warms a little brown sugary note with a small rush of alcohol surfaces but it really does remain easy to drink. There is also a consistant foamy head sitting on top until the very last drop which is great."
"This beer is one of those ""beergeek"" types. Almost no information on the label. Just the ingredients, that's it. From experience I know it's a dubbel, and a damn good one at that! Pours a lovely dark red color, with a thin layer of froth that stays for a very long time. Pretty sweet, almost no bitterness. Nice bubbliness. While I'm not usually a dubbel drinker, this great beer is very enjoyable!"
"Abbaye de Notre-Dame de Saint-Rémy.... With 8 being first and 6 being 2nd. Highly reccomend it."
"D- a nice beer to relax with. i could down 3 or 4 of these in a night. Smooth and goes down the throat pretty quick. I am impressed. A great beer!"
"A very nice beer. I've had the others many times, but I blieve this is my first time ever sampling the 6. Pours a light chestnut/ dark amber with a very nice finely beaded head that leaves some very nice lacing. Aromas of dried fruit and nuts, clove, and cake. The taste echoes some of this, but it is much more vibrant on the tastebuds while still preserving a somewhat restrained and elegant character. Fruit and spice up front, particularly prunes and cloves, but also a touch of dried cherry, cinnamon, and perhaps a bit of licorice. Fairly complex, but very smooth and enjoyable. I'm beginning to enjoy the ""lower numbered"" Belgians very much."
"D- Easy to drink and refreshing."
"D- Very drinkable. It's light and pleasant."
"Appears a clouded murky amber with fine effervescent carbonation that rises from the bottle as soon as I remove the cap. Large billowing head that I was able to decant and form into shapes as I poured, fine Belgian style lacing left behind as it dwindles down. Aroma has muted sweetness with heavy powdered yeast dryness going on with a sharp air of spices including anise, coriander, and something with a citrus quality. As it warms rich dark fruit sweetness comes out to complement the liquid bread tones I was initially getting. Flavor is much creamier than the smell let's on. Tame sweetness with fresh bread dough and powdered yeast, mild hints of raisin form as well. Spice and herbal mint features flourish here as well, coriander and a touch of anise among the vast array of foreign flavors. Complex and more sessionable thant the 8 or the 10, but loses some of the kick that makes these Trappist Ales so legendary. Mouthfeel is perfect velvet smoothness carbonation level tiny bubbled effervescence for sure, making each swallow easier than the last one. Drinkability is decent complex with yeast characteristics definitely nice to come back to this Belgian after not really sampling many as of late. At one point in my beer journey I studied at the Sharp Edge Creekhouse, this is a nice way of easing back into the Belgian ales."
"Trappistes Rochefort 6 is one excellent drink, featuring fine flavors and a carbonation profile that I can only describe as ""perfect"". This is a special beer, to be sure, but were it not for the considerable expense involved in doing so, I'd regularly stock my fridge with it, bust it out after mowing the lawn, drink it for breakfast, put it in a beer bong, take it fishing, Hell... if it were a gal, I'd marry it!"
"D, notes: This beer grew on me as I drank it. Very malty and rich with significant alcohol warming, which adds to its drinkability."
"It could have been a bit stronger in full flavor... next in line #8 #10"
"Definitely nice, but didn't shock me like the 10."
"Overall, this was interesting although not as impressive as it's 8 and 10 siblings. It felt a bit unidimensional."
"Overall it's drinkable but barely. It's also really expensive, not recommended."
"D - Very easy to drink and very enjoyable. This is an excellent entry level Belgian. What's not to love?"
"All in all, I like this beer a lot. It's not quite a world-beater, but still a very tasty beverage that, if not for the price, I would go back to often."
"Drinkability is high since its not very heavy and still a tasty brew. Seek this one out if you can. Pretty good stuff and worth the effort to try and find one."
"The comparison to the other two beers isn't fair; this is a nice one. But, like so many others, I'll be unlikely to pick this one up again when presented with the others."
"D-This is one of those beers that will always catch your attention. Tons of flavor, depth and complexity. Maybe not a world class standout beer, but still one that everyone should seek out."
"not bad, and paired decently with my braised rabbit entree."
"A very drinkable dark ale - a couple of these on a cool evening with some sharp cheese as an accent would be very pleasant. All in all, a very nice experience but probably not one I would often seek out."
"Rochefort 6 is lovely nectar that that pours dark brown with amber hues with a modest off white head. The aroma is fruity and woody with a hint of alcohol esters. The flavor is sweet and malty with woody notes and fruits like raisons, white grapes, prune and dried cherries popping in and out. It has a medium body and lively carbonation. The texture is smooth and coats the tongue. I really enjoyed this outstanding trappistes beer."
"Medium bodied, nice smooth feel, good all around drinker without having to sip or pace yourself. I'm glad to have tried this beer but would definitely head for the 8 or 10 given the option."
"Very nice beer."
"Medium-bodied mouthfeel, not particularly well carbonated. Very drinkable though."
"This beer explodes with carbonation and settles down just as fast. Murky brown body. Divine smell of creamy dark fruit. with a slight bitter bite. Slightly sweet figs ends with an odd dry bitterness. Very light mouthfeel with a slight prickle. A well executed beer, heavenly and light."
"An excellent beer, but it does come at a price. If it were cheaper I'd enjoy this more often, but for now it's a ""once in a while"" type offering."
"D: This is a decently drinkable beer. If you like the style, it's recommended."
"D: definitely one of the better trappists that I have had. nice fruity belgian. alcohol is well hidden. very drinkable."
"This is a bit thin and uneventful compared to the 8 and 10. Sitll, in all, it's not too shabby on its own, with enough character to keep it interesting. Disappears easily enough (too easily?)"
"D- I really enjoyed this beer. I'm not a huge fan of the funky, yeasty tastes I've found in other trappist beers. This one was more mellow and very enjoyable."
"D - Drinkability is good. The alcohol is well hidden. The flavor is what to look for in a Belgian brew. Very good overall."
"A sharp, bubbly alcoholic bite is noticable upon the first sip. Flavor follows with biscuity toffee malts, vanilla, and caramel. Lacking are the luscious, malty fruit notes of 6's two bigger brothers. Mouthfeel is UBER-carbonated, almost to the point of unpleasantness. This beer definatlely lacks the smoothness that I had come to expect from Rochefort. Overall, 6 was a big disappointment, as Rochefort 10 is my only 5.0 on this site, and I've rated 8 highly as well. That's not to say it was a bad beer; it was just, disappointing."
"Mouthfeel verges on creamy with a lighter body. Nice alcohol warmth is felt which leaves a dry finish. This is a classic."
"330 ml bottle. Served in a snifter, the beer pours a cloudy dark brown with a half inch tan head. Head retention and lacing is pretty good. It smells like dark fruit (raisins, plums), belgian yeast, and caramel. Taste is similar to the aroma, but there's also some cherries and pepper in there too. Mouthfeel/body is medium, not too heavy, not too thin. Also has a lot of lively carbonation, a bit too much I think. The high carbonation hurts the drinkability a bit, but with that being said it's not hard to drink. Alcohol isn't noticable at all. Overall I think it's a good beer, I'd drink it again for sure."
"This is a very worthwhile beer, complementing the other two Rocheforts yet having enough character to stand on its own. No, it's not quite the beer those other two are, but it's hardly a slouch."
"I like this one, but it seems a little light and lacking. Hopefully its brothers are closer to the elevated level which I had been expecting from this brewery."
"D: A nice trappist beer, but not my favorite. Considering the ABV, quite drinkable. Pairs better with food than on its own."
"And don't be in a rush to serve straight out of the fridge like I did tonight. Be patient and let it warm before serving. You'll be rewarded for your patience."
"Poured from bottle into chalice and enjoyed on a nice sunny afternoon. Pours deep brown with thick cream head. Great retention and lacing, a little too much sediment though. Smell is of dark fruit, some grape and a bit of yeast and caramel. Taste is very similar to a brown beer. Sweet fruit, some yeast, and a bit of nuttiness as well. Mouthfeel isnt too heavy, a little too much carbonation I thought. Leaves a pleasant, slightly dry aftertaste. Overall a great beer and easy drinker. The low ABV means you can enjoy one or two without getting wasted. Nice job Trappistes as usual."
"The beer pours a cloudy brown color with a thick frothy offwhite head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a mild, roasted and crystal malt scent along with a slight yeasty aroma. It's dry with no signs of warming. The taste is good also. It has a moderate brown ale flavor with some yeast esters in the finish. It's light with some nutty/roasted character. The mouthfeel is decent. It is a medium bodied beer with a little too much carbonation. This is a good drinking beer. It doesn't blow the roof off, but it's a solid offering; an easy drinker."
"The date code stamped on the label stated L 21 02 12 08:23. I understand that indicates an expiration date of 2012, meaning a bottling date of February 2007. Poured into a large wine glass, the beer is a russet-orange color with a thick beige head. The head drops to a thin layer with moderate lacing. The aroma is muted with notes of caramel, spice and dark fruit. The flavor profile is on the mild side as well. Some dark cherries and bready yeast can be picked out, but there's no particular flavor that stands out. There is a bit of alcohol warmth noted that's more than I expected from the 7.5% ABV. The mouthfeel is smooth with a cider-like tang. The Rochefort 6 was an easy to drink beer that presents a very subtle aroma and flavor profile."
"D- Great beer to experience. I enjoyed this one on my brithday as a treat."
"There is little to improve on with this brew.. pricey.. but lovely."
"Malty sweet flavors come out strong and that fades to a subtle coffee/bittersweet chocolate flavor."
"A little over-carbonated although the body maintains a fullness that keeps things solid. Relatively high ABV (7.5%) isn't in the least bit detectable and the mild nature of the beer makes for a highly drinkable, if slightly disappointing, beverage."
"I think this is a really good beer. I've never been a huge fan of Belgians, as I feel they all kinda taste the same, but this one is just a bit different. Quite nice."
"Pretty smelling beer, molasses malts meet flowery hops. Some grapes or raisins too. Poors with a very small beige head that disappears completely. Color is a muddy brown with a red tinge, thick with small particles. Flavor is nice, but nothing jumps out too much at me. Texture starts creamy and then fininshes dry and metallicy in the back of the mouth. Carbonation is lively, but the beer isn't quite as alive. This brew is good, but I have had better Abbey Dubbels."
"The bottom line: Surprisingly disappointing. I love Belgian beers and I like the other offerings from Rochefort. 6 lacks the depth that I expect from them, and with the price on the bottle, I expect a lot more."
"pours a very dark brown color with tons of action going on, carbonation rising up and sediment floating arround, like a mini beer jacuzzi. originally i was going to give the smell a 4.0 but after hovering over it, just enveloping the aromas i give it a 5.0 its just amazing, so full and complex it makes my mouth salivate over it. the taste is good, but lacks compared to the smell. its good but it isn't nearly as good as the other rochefort i had . not a bad beer by any means"
"Decided to crack this one after a very stressful game as my cougs barely hung on to beat ASU and in celebration of the huskies getting dominated by arizona. Pours a brown with ruby colors and tons of carbonation and a decent head that goes pretty fast. smell is of spice mostly with some dark fruits. Spicy taste up front. Dark fruits come out through the middle. A very lingering aftertaste that has a slightly creamy (taste not mouthfeel) note to it and a nice dry finish. Mouthfeel is a bit thin, but drinkability is good. Honestly, This is a great great beer, but I dont see why anyone would buy this if you had access to the 8. 10 is just a whole different ballgame. Good beer, try it so you know."
"Add'l Notes: I decided to pair this with some leftovers to see the result, and surprisingly, it went very well with slow-cooked pork-loin with a base of vinegar, tomato sauce, and pineapple."
"This beer poured a dark brown color with a slight red amber tint to it. Pleasantly unfiltered and hazy, with a huge gob of yeast matter at the bottom of the bottle. Produced a nice big head initially, then settled to a 1/4 inch head which remained througout. The smell was very different than any other Belgians I have had. It is fragrant, with bits of bready yeast, chocolate covered cherry filling, and possibly a bit of tropical fruit. I was disappointed in the taste of this beer. It was not bad but it also did not live up to its nationality or its abv. There is very little alchohol taste or smell to speak of. The mouth feel is decent, with the light bubbly feel of many Belgians. Drinkability is not terrible, but I also won't go out of my way to find another of these..."
"D - Overall a very drinkable Belgian and one that should go well with cheese pairings. It is good in the fact that it is simple and not overly complex. I think it is a beer that almost calls for food especially since it seems to be a rather dry beer that reminds me a bit like wine. Another good beer from Rochefort."
"D- Very good beer. Hides the alcohol well with malts."
"**Extra Note** - Thought it was interesting that on the official website of the beer, it was claimed that this beer is ""almost unfindable"" and ""probably brewed only once a year""... In addition, they stated that this particular beer represented ""only 1% of the brewery's total production""..."
"Dark toffee brown with light caramel head. Some chunks of lacing and a pretty heavy ring. Head dissipates to a foamy island. The aroma is sweet and bready with some fruit and coffee/burnt toffee. Taste is spicy malt with a prickly mouthfeel. A pretty clean taste for an ale. My first impression was that I didnt really like it but it kind of grows on you."
"Poured from a 330ml bottle into a tulip glass. Pours a clear medium brown with nice head and good lacing. Aroma is sweet and fruity a little like figs. Taste is fruity with a subtle sweetness and just a slight bitterness. Mouthfeel is medium, with nice carbonation. Overall an incredible beer, wish I had more than one..."
"Notes: Fantastic tasting beer. Unfortunately I didn't have much on hand to pair it with, but I imagine it would go very well with most anything. However, sitting back and enjoying this one by itself with a little mood music just took all my cares away. I'll be picking this one up again and again."
"Murky brown with bronze tints and a smooth, off-white creamy head that clings to the glass's edge as it sinks down. The aroma is delicious with pastry dough, sugar, glazed donut and some kind of near-eastern sugary treat I cannot identify. The flavor is a repeat of the aroma (although to a lesser degree) but adds a dusty coating of spiciness not unlike anise or fennel seed. I also sense the flavor and aroma of 25 cent gumballs from the machine in the hardware store of my childhood. As it warms I smell flowers and saturday mornings in May. Soft medium body with a smooth yet mouth-filling carbonation. These flavors and aromas are miles ahead in complexity and depth from most of the other Belgian offerings in this category. I prefer this over the Rochefort 10 for its added layers and nuances beyond the mere weight of added boozy dark fruit/ yeast depth. This is what I want to accompany my winter stew of lamb and creamy tomato with star anise."
"D: Wonderful; may not be the premier beer from this brewery but it outranks most other Strong Dark Ales."
"Poured into my Duvel tulip out of the 330 mL bottle. There is a 2 inch head that settles slowly to a thick, dense, creamy crown. The beer is cola brown and has a nice chimney of carbonation rising from the center of the glass. It smells great. Sweet, spicy, malty with coriander, anise, soap, and fruity caramel bleeding out of the glass. The flavor is full, rich, dynamic, and strong. This is great. There is a citrusy and floral aspect underneath a well balanced malt base. There is a faint cherry taste from the alcohol and the end has a piny touch of hops. Just enough to make it bittersweet before the next malty start. Slightly cidery from the blend of sweet, tart, fruity, malty, and rich. Just the right amount of carbonation."
"Carries complexity, but a tolerable amount of it. Starts off frothy in the mouth and rides for a few seconds before formally closing with a citrus-esqe end. It lingers though in the mouth and you get a thick somewhat hearty flavor when you move your mouth. Overall this wont be my favorite Belgian brew, and certainly not what I consider the best by the Trappists, but its still good."
"D: Very enjoyable to drink - spend the money on this one if you can find it."
"Smooth drinking, alcohol well hidden. My all time favorite is the Rochefort 10, and I can see this brew's similarity. Solid."
"Belgian yeast with a hint of sweet grains right off the bat. Very dark brown in color. The head of foam forms a creamy lace. Solid body all the way through. Plenty of carbonation with a solid aftertaste. Going down it doesn't taste too strong, but you definatly get the feeling that there is a good amount of alcohol in it. Feels like a weaker yeasty wine going down. Really a super beer, but i wouldn't drink more than 2 in a sitting. Well worth the 5 bucks a bottle."
"Dark reddish orange color, startes with a nice thick head, but the foam quickly shrinks away. Still left some lace from the thin ring of remaining bubbles. Lots of nice aromes, caramel, dark fruits, and some alcohol comes through. The alcohol is noticeable in the taste, but not overly strong. Some flavor of plum/prune, some dark chocolate malt, and a bit of smoke. Lots of carbonation gives it a bit of a bite. Very drinkable, if only it weren't so expensive. I think I like the 8 a tiny bit better, but both are very good."
"Overall: A truly great beer. Now I need to seek out the 8 and the 10."
"This beer appears translucent with dark copper color and a small, but nice, pillowy head that fades but never dissappears in my chalice. The smell is very light although complex with detectable aroma's of caramel and cloves. The taste is dry with a light creamyness and butterscotch/caramel finish with subdued Belgian yeast spiceyness. The mouthfeel is light and smooth with small tight bubbles that are relatively soft. This beer went down well and I would not hesitate to drink several of them in a sitting (if I could afford it). Good beer."
"Drinkability: There's better Belgian ales out there in my opinion, but this is certainly one to try if you come across it."
"I poured this at 42F into a Gulden Draak glass. It's fiercely carbonated, so I decided to let it warm up a bit in the glass before I even sniffed it. The haze began to clear as it came up to cellar temperature. I watched the foam dissipate quickly, leaving a ring and some flat islands on the surface. The aroma of chocolate covered, candied orange peel, popped into my head as if i had walked into a Brussels chocolate shop. It reminded me also of Sabra liqueur, for those familiar. This blew my mind. The citrus/spice/dark-fruit/malty sweetness in the mouth was sensational and everlasting. The alcohol is well hidden, but not for long, if you know what I mean. Not the greatest looking beer, but a wonderful sweet treat that gets better as it warms."
"D- It is very drinkable and good but would say it's my least favorite out of 6, 8, and 10. I may get it again but would probably go for 8 mostly since it's the same price."
"Tastes of fruits, a fair amount of yeast, caramel malt and spicy hops. This is very drinkable."
"D - A very nice beer that's not too overpowering like some others can be. Could put a couple away."
"Another wonderful beer from Trappistes, 6 is incredibly smooth, all too easy to consume, and rife with subtle complication. The presentation was grand, with a three-finger head blanketing a rich ruby red body. It emitted wonderful aroma and accosted the taste buds with berry, a bit of caramel smoothness, raspberry, citrus, spices such as cinnamon and to me a good deal of grape. It was quite sweet like an easy red wine, but far more mysterious and detailed. There is lots of chocolate, but also a prominent black licorice taste that makes me suspect the addition of anise. This would be so easy to quaff, but for the price and the panoply of tastes demanding slower, detailed attention. Though expensive, 6 and 8 were more than worth the try, and were among the very best I've ever had. Classifying this as a ""Strong Dark Ale"" might not be entirely accurate due to the taste and texture; regardless, this is magnificent, simply first-rate."
"well first of all i have been waiting a long time to try real trappist ale. i bought the rochefort 6,8,and 10. this is the first i decided to try hopefully im saving the best(10) for last... well im not dissapointed at all from this one its pretty much what i expected. the most suprising thing was the ammount of carbonation probably. i had read in other reviews that this was like the light version of trappist ale and with a ABV of 7.5 you could have fooled me to around 5% which is a good thing because the alcohol doesnt overwhelm the taste of the ale. I like it a lot and really respect and enjoy the quality put into brewing this. i will probably re review this later on when ive tried the other 2"
"The taste is of candy sugar, dark malts, belgian yeast, and prunes. Just a great all around flavor. Even though its a bit lighter in ABV than the 8 and 10 its got as much flavor and just as enjoyable to drink. The mouthfeel is heavy enough to feel and light enough to drink a pint. It takes a fair amount of control to not chug the entire contents of the glass upon taking the first sip. Very very drinkable."
"Mouthfeel is rich and crisp. Drinkability is good for this abv. A tasty strong ale."
"D  Slightly on the sweet side and highly carbonated but very drinkable for 7.5%."
"Trappistes Rochefort 6 was a hazed orange-brown color with an off-white head. The head had great retention with some lacing left behind. The aroma was sweet dried fruit and malt. The taste was malt, fruit and yeast with dry finish and balanced bitterness. It was medium-light in body with nice carbonation, very smooth. Drinkability was excellent. This is a wonderful brew that is definitely worth seeking out."
"Sweet smells with the alchohol noticed some. Taste was similar to smell. Some sweet hints of citrus and chocolate tasting some alchohol. Smooth mothfeel with a dry finish. A slow drinker to be savored and enjoyed."
"I've tried most of the well known trappist and abbey beers (even Westvleteren), and none of them come close to Rochefort. I am so happy that the 6 is now available locally, but it sure does have me craving the 8 and 10."
"Drinkability : Bonne bière trappiste (pas trop forte)"
"Always a treat. Reddish brown with amber feet. White head with not much retention, but great Belgian lace. Smells musty, bready, fruity (raspberry and some citrus), and has a little hoppy character. Taste has fruit up front (I'm getting mostly raspberry) and a musty malty hop finish. Silky smooth. Delightful. Like nectar from heaven. Perfect when you just want a solid solid beer that isn't going to put hair on your chest. I really love the Rochefort beers. Every # suits a purpose, mood, occasion, or tune. Really top notch. Really hard to beat."
"D: Pretty easy, this is not a session beer, it is definitely one to be enjoyed."
"Looking forward to trying the ""10."""
"Though this is not my favorite beer I have tried I have to say that I have to really respect its characteristics. Just because I am not huge into it does not mean that it is not an extremely well crafted beer. I am no judge. This beer is very complex and takes a while to drink because you taste something different almost every time you pick up your glass. I would recommend this beer."
"Finish is cocoa powdery with medium length, and easy to drink, but just not very appetizing for the next sip."
"drinkability is good, althnough this one will creep up on drinkers who do not have a high tolerance. the booze is present, but not 7.5% worth. all things considered, this is a solid example of the style and a great brew for lovers of Belgians. cheers!"
"carbonation is still pretty high for this one like the contemporary one but quickly drops over time. Smoothness and drinkability was simply revolutionary; it is as smooth, drinkable and refreshing as water but of course with the greatness of Rochefort 6 itself. I have never had a beer this smooth, drinkable and refreshing before and this part of it sets it apart really positively. Overall it is definitely a notch better than the contemporary Rochefort 6 and I would call it a well aged and pretty fruity tasty beer with a revolutionary smoothness and refreshing nature."
"drinkability is great. balanced and very enjoyable."
"The beer pours a bit of a hazy purple to dark red color with the head pertinent in size, frothy in texture and the lace fine long lasting sheets. Vinous lots of malt, fruit sweet, quite pleasant to sniff with the start ambrosial and the top skinny in feel. Finish is astringent, pleasantly hopped and a nice dry lingering aftertaste. A good beer, not as good as the 8/10, but still a top notch beer nonetheless."
"This is maybe my favorite of the Rochefort lineup. A nice orangish brown with a decent head that lasts in my Chimay glass. The smell is fruity. Taste is like a carbonated brown ale. There are hints of caramel. The mouthfeel is smooth, with just a hint of burn at the end. Drinkability is good. I could have this brew again."
"As expected, this is a toned-down version of it's big brothers, and is a heckuva nice drink. Head is mountainous, color uninspiring. Champagne bubbles flow like champagne. Smell, as well as taste are owned by dark chocolate, and fresh fruity tones. Finish is airtight. Mouthfeel is crisp and velvety at once, and it's drinking itself. In the future, I can't imagine a situation where I would grab this in lieu of the 10, but this is a hell of a fine beer."
"My first chance to get the little brother of the Rochefort labels. This murky brown brew sports a solid head that eventually laces the glass for the rest of the drink. Aroma is dark fruits, raisins, dates and figs with a little brown sugar sweetness in the background. Taste is slightly sweet with the aforementioned fruits with a root beer like follow through that is very tasty. A very drinkable brew for the alcohol content, which hides for most of this beer."
"D--I dont think I would get this beer again if the 8 or 10 were available, it is a fine beer when you place it in a bigger picture (i.e.it kicks most of the world's other beers tail) Much lighter and refreshing in terms of Belgian beers. I personally, will take a Quad every time...Pass me a 10 please if you dont mind."
"D: Not one of the better Trappistes in my opinion, I prefer the 10 and the 8, but still a good beer, but could use more body, easy to drink though."
"Drinkability - This is wonderfully complex yet light and easy to drink."
"Poured into a chalice a nice mahogany color, nice carbonation, nice small creamy off-white head, which then left some nice islands and creamy sticky lacing throughout the drink. The nose is malty, plums, raisins, figs, and some caramel. The taste is very nice, malty, sweet, a slight tang, and fruity. You would not know there was any alcohol in this puppy. Medium body, well rounded/complex brew. Very drinkable, I'm really enjoying this one, highly recommended."
"Overall, this is a fairly average and tame depiction of a belgian strong dark ale. I have the Eight as well, I can't wait to try it, as I hear that it's much better than the Six."
"11.2 oz. bottle- color of extremely dark honey, with a thick tan head - nose of raisins, apricots, and slight orange  taste of raisins, apricots, and slight orange - body is light, and with low to medium carbonation  aftertaste of raisins, apricots, orange, and malt"
"Overall, this beer was a disappointment (especially when compared to the 10). In its defense however, I may be scoring the taste too low simply because the carbonation did not give the liquid sufficient time to settle on my palate."
"Drinkability- The taste is very interesting, but the overcarbonation really turns me off."
"Pouring a muddy brown with large solids visible, I will give this brew some merit upon its wonderfully light mouthfeel, hints of fragrant apple and beautiful lacing. On the flip side of the coin, I simply didn't find any balance in the flavor here, the affront of alcohol leaving a sour aftertaste on my tongue akin to that found from a bottle of cheap vodka. I can only hope that this was on account of my particular bottle having gone bad and should my next encounter with this product ring upon a more positive note, I will be back to tell you about it!"
"A very enjoyable beer; not as rich as some other Belgian strong dark ales, but still very tasty. I'd rather get a Rochefort 8 for the same price, but I don't mean any major disrespect to this beer. An excellent starting point for darker Trappist ales."
"A very good beer reserved for those who know. Complex, malty, and estery, highly recommended. I'm always mixed when alcohol is present, but at 7.5% its nowhere near as bad as you'd think. A great beer that I could drink all day except that four would probably put me to sleep."
"At 7.5%, the baby brother of the Rochefort beers loses some ground to other Strong Darks due to thinness of body. Smooth and quite light for the color and flavor profile, partially due to the high carbonation. Very tasty Dark Ale, not quite the richness and complexity of the very best, but enjoyable and very drinkable for the style."
"Drinkability: If stranded on a desert island, this may be the one I want. Even better than the 8."
"Pours a light cola brown, with a bit tan head, tonnes of beautiful lacing. Smell of caramel, sweet peaches and alcohol. Dark fruit, complex, a touch of spice, malty and moderate alcohol. This is a very tasty beer, with sweetness upfront, then some phenols and esters, and it finishes a touch dry."
"Medium body, plentiful effervescence, warms the throat. An aftertaste that is reminscent of fruitcake with lingering cherry & brandy flavors though there was pine/resin up front. A very good brew, glad I finally got the Trappistes ""trifecta""."
"-Oelergud"
"Not worth the $5.50 to have it again, but certainly worth it to try once."
"IF YOU DRINK ONE, let it warm, and let it get a little flatter. it's much, much better that way."
"D: A very drinkable Belgian overall, not sure if I'd consider it a favorite, even though it is strikingly good. Would definitely not turn down another glass of this, and would recommend it to those who haven't tried the 8 or 10 first."
"A very fine brew to be sure, but not world class like the 8 and 10."
"A bright and clean mouthfeel despite the thick initial texture and amount of sediment. It was a solid beer, but I expected more after having the Trappistes Rochefort 10."
"I don't know why it took me so long to drink my first offering from one of the most respected breweries in the world. I was less than floored initially, but now that I'm at the bottom of the bottle, I'm able to recognize the brilliance of Trappistes Rochefort 6. If it was less expensive, I'd gladly buy this delicious elixir in bulk. Now I can't wait to drink 8 and 10."
"Pours a slightly hazy mahogany red with a foamy light tan head that forms a lot of lace. Smell was nicely floral banana bread, that wonderful Rochefort yeast strain that is prevelent in all their beers. Taste was like Rochefort 8, but the hops are more pronounced. Dark fruits and bready, with a long earthy hop finish. Taste was crisper than the 8 and the 10, but that velvetty smoothness and well-veiled ABV are still wonderfully present. This is very drinkable, when compared to other strong dark ales."
"Pours a semi clear brown color with just a slight hint of red. The head was disappointing and did not leave much if any lacing. I will discount this due to the fact that I just washed my glass. The smell is of hint of wine and chocolate, mellow, quite pleasant but not overpowering. The taste has tones of chocolate and some sweetness to it, though it is hard to pinpoint, maybe cherries. The feel is very fizzy, I believe it takes away from the taste a bit. But beyond the over carbonation, this is brew goes down easy. The only negative is the over carbonation, aside from that this beer has a nice mellow flavor and is very drinkable. Not as fruity as other BSDAs."
"Could easily put many of these away, in this respect perhaps the most drinkable Rochefort."
"D: Very drinkable, smooth and tasty. It's not my favorite Trappist beer, but still worthy of another sample."
"Pours with classic dubbel thickness, and a pretty toasted brown with some russet highlights. The head is sticky and tenacious. Phenolic aroma enhanced by yeasty chocolate and spice notes. Some earthy hops, too. Very little in the way of sweet caramel smells -- no evidence of caramelization of sugars in the nose. On the palate, light and fresh flavors for a beer this rich. Very soft sweetness, like malted chocolate, and a pronounced nutty yeast flavor. High, sustained notes of fruitiness throughout the palate, but especially notable at the end. Light in mouthfeel, with just a touch of present alcohol toward the end, and subtle, unobtrusive carbonation. What a fabulous beer. Prototypical for the dubbel style, and obscenely hard to improve upon."
"Notes: Label had some sort of date information stamped on it but I'll be damned if I can decipher it: L 28 09 10. . . . I really had to knock down the appearance score because it was so full of sediment. Hey, I've homebrewed, so I know it happens. But there was a lot at the bottom of the glass, and worse, a LOT in suspension throughout and frankly this would've been a 5 in drinkability but all that sediment made me slow down a bit. . . . I didn't score it higher in taste because it just seemed so light in the finish that after the sip is gone, you don't taste anything. . . . Drinking this has made me curious about their stronger offerings; I look forward to the 8 and 10. . . ."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a bit of a biting carbonation. The drinkability is decent but the chalkiness gives this a bit of a drying effect, and not really in a good way. Maybe I'll have to give this another shot sometime in the future."
"Beautiful pour and lacing with a head that can only be created by a trappist monk. Rather heavy amount of sediment and a nice, rustic ruddy complexion. Outstanding, I can't take my eyes off of this thing. The smell is of light fruits mixed with some gentle alcohol esters. The tase is fruity combined with rich spices and a tasty blend of complexities. The mouthfeel is a repeat of the beautiful appearance, light and fluffy but with a crisp bite at the finish. Good stuff here, I can't wait for the 8 and 10."
"A very nice beer, delightfully Belgian, but at the end of the day all it does for me is make me crave Rochefort 8."
"Opinion: This is an incredible beer. I must stick by my guns and say that I probably think that the #8 is the most drinkable and flavorful beer, but this one is still most satisfying. Though I think that the 10 is one of the most incredible beers that ever was produced by man, it is such that if you drink one that you can't drink anything else. The 8 I am enjoying right now is not that way, and I feel like I could polish off a whole six-pack of this stuff. Unfortunately, none of these beers are available in my regular market of Texas anymore, so I will just finish the one that I just got in Florida and reflect upon it when I get home. Sad but true."
"The 6 is just a great treat with enough character and resistance to keep you wanting more. I'm very bullish on this beer. I'm going to rock a 6-pack of it the next time I crash a house party."
"D - This is yet another great Rochefort brew."
"Finally came across the 6; the third and final Rochefort for me to review - 330 mL bottle with 28/09/10 on the label, making Oct. '05 the bottling date. It pours into the tulip an orange/garnet, hugely active, with a 3-finger, off-white, fluffy head that becomes more dense as it settles, and leaves nice sheets of lace. There are notes of rum bread, plums, anise, and green hops in the nose, with hints of vanilla, apples, chocolate, blue/blackberries, and sweet cherries - quite pleasant. It is harsh and overly-carbonated on the first sip, so I let it warm for a bit before resuming. When I do, I find rum bread, cinnamon, anise, maybe some other spices, yeast, and green hops that impart a mild bitterness. After the initial carbonation subsides, I find a medium, drying body, and a short finish that slowly lengthens. Overall it was a bit too harsh, and, although it has nice accents, I feel that it needed more sweet malts to give them some ballast. A fairly good Belgian, but for a Trappist, this was kind-of a let down. Maybe I didn't get the best bottle, or maybe it's just not up my alley, but I'm sure I'll meet this beer again sometime, perhaps if only for its namesake."
"Gotta love them trappist beers. This one (Rocerfort 6) pours a light brown with excellent head retention. Sediment could also be seen floating around the glass. There were some enticing chocolate, bread and fuit smells going on in this one, which all seemed to get stronger as the beer warmed to room temperature. Taste had loads of fruits such as figs and grapes, with a bit of caramel sweetness. Mouthfeel was light to medium, and oh so smooth on the palate. This was easily the most drinkable of the three offerings from Rochefort. Kudos to the brothers for suggesting pairing it with some soft cheeses. I used some Chimay cheese and crumbled goat cheese on what crackers. In short, great beer. Cheers"
"Poured from a 11.2oz.bottle. Began with a nice head that disappeared quickly, the color is a dark rusty orange, murky with tiny carbonation bubbles gently rising to the surface. The smell is of caramel and molasses, the flavor is very similar, don't detect any alcohol flavor.The mouthfeel is slightly watery around the edges of my tongue, this would be an extremely drinkable beer if it wasn't for the price."
"A well crafted ale that could be so much better if it were not for the intensity of carbonation. Probably my least favorite of the Rochefort offerings, but still mandatory for any Belgian lover."
"D: Well hidden alcohol with wonderful flavors and aromas. What more do I need to say? Kinda pricey but worth it."
"Exceptionally smooth mouthfeel, a buttery diacetyl eases it along. If money was no object, I could make six of these disappear, easy."
"D: What can I say? Big fan of the fruity smells. Makes me think of a nice fall day. Can a beer go well with donuts?"
"This beer poured a cloudy brown with a thick head  not too much lacing. The smell is quite malty and a bit sour. The taste is very malty and somewhat sour - the alcohol is noticeable. There is slight bitter aftertaste. The mouthfeel is full but not thick or chewy. The carbonation is very apparent. This is a delicious beer that Id love to drink often."
"A clean dark brown ale with nice ruby highlights. Has a silky smooth and creamy beige head and a nice lace ring. The aroma is full of dried fruit, raisins and figs. With hints of apple, nuts and oak in the background. The taste starts with a quick hint of tabacco and then slides into the cornocopia of dried fruits, nuts and wood. The tabacco character comes back on the finish. To add dryness as a balance for the sweetness in the middle."
"Only small drawback, the texture was a smidgen thin and flat. But still, a very drinkable and enjoyable treat  but $50 for a sixer? OOPH."
"all in all, this is the very druinkable little brother to no.s 8 and 10. I would have no complaints to drink this all night, except that is costs four bucks a thimbleful, essentially. Its a must if you dig trappists though."
"Acorn colored with a huge small-bubbled but not-creamy off-white head on top. Smell is minerally, oily, and a bit orangy. Flavor is not pleasurable to me. I cannot stop thinking of gasoline. Hot alcohol and a very nut-oily, medium-thick, sweet, pretty 1-dimensional taste. Hints of chocolate and cherries, but the reminiscence of rum just turns me off. It improves drastically as it gets to room temperature, but to my palate it still seems amateurish compared to what I want from a strong Belgian dark ale. Scratch the sweet rumminess and whatever else makes me think of gasoline, and I might enjoy it. Apparently Rochefort beers are not my bag."
"Rochefort 6 is just what I have come to expect from this line of beers. The 6 is much like it's higher AC brothers but with a sweeter twinge. The mouthfeel is very efferfescent (sp?) and bubbly. Very tasty but just not quite as good as the 8 or the 10. I would still drink this beer as regularly as I can obtain it."
"Not quite what I have come to expect from a strong Belgian ale, but very nice. A bit more refreshing than the heavier Belgians."
"Notes: I was somewhat disappointed with this beer. I think the serving temp was wrong and so I'm not willing to give up on it yet..."
"D - Was this a Strong Dark Ale? It's definitely a quaffable beer and at 7.5%, it's not as damaging as the style permits. I'd have another if it wasn't $5 for 11.2oz."
"A very nice offering. This is a must add to my dark ale roster. I would pair this with a nice roasted pork loin and gravy for a Sunday dinner. If you can get your hands on this, do."
"Taste- A mellow sweetness reminiscent of tootsie rolls mixes with a slightly astringent vinous character. Plenty of natural and earthy flavors give this beer an organic feel. Well crafted and pleasant with my pork roast and baked potatoes."
"Drinkability: Very high."
"Pours a gorgeous dark amber color with ruby highlights. Very cloudy with a dense off white head with great tracing. Aromas burst with sweet, ripe fruits, esters abound. Can't quite put my nose to words but this one is full of intense fruity aromas. Flavor is subtle roasted notes, caramel, more fruits, plums and raisins. Finish is sweet but also a bit mouth puckering dry, an interesting contrast. Hop flavor is very subtle if barely detected, bitterness as well. This is quite a beer. The carbonation level seems medium, could have gone higher, but I like the lessened amount for bigger beers. The off dry finish is somewhat off putting for me, but understandable for style. I have found the other two Rocheforts to be a bit more rustic while I think this is more approachable and enjoyable. An ideal digestif or dessert pairing for pear or apple based desserts."
"This will be my special treat beer whenever I want to celebrate something."
"Had this in Brussels at the Poechenellekelder. It was served at cellar temp in a typical wide-mouthed Belgium ale glass. The looks were pleasant. Brown with ruby highlights shining through, and a thick tan head on top. The smell was pleasing. Sweet, with raisens and dates and malty goodness coming through. It makes sense that this was served at room temp. The beer really woke up. The taste. Just divine. Smooth. All the flavours of the 10, without the harshness of the alcohol. Just really, really nice. Mouthfeel was medium with fairly light carbonation, and drinkability was hard to beat."
"Beautifully complex and crafted with the utmost quality. A world class beer that deserves to be sipped and enjoyed."
"This is a good, quality Belgian ale. While I prefer the 8 and the 10, I'm glad to finally have the 6 available."
"11.2oz brown bottle with a date of 28 09 10 stamped on the front. Pours a sligtly hazy medium brown with a huge head, great longevity and unbeliveable lace. Smells of chocolate and caramel malts. Some dried dark fruits and a spicy peppery yeastiness. Whiffs of alcohol are also present. chocolate and caramel notes are present mixed with a sherry like taste. Alcohol is present. Peppery hop presence is detected but the big malts make them quickly fade. Highly carbonated. Still a bit young to be a great beer but I have two more that will be very nice in a year or so."
"Drinkability: Amazing drinkability - one of the best trappist ales that I've had. Awesome developments in malts and great finish. Wonderful."
" Aroma of tangerine hops, light caramel malt, and some peppery yeast notes. Palate is complex, with notes of pepper, tangerine and other citrus, light nutty malt, and just a hint of fruity hops. Body is rich, although a touch foamy. I do find this beer enjoyable, but the 8 and 10 from Rochefort are definitely superior."
"Best before ""28.09.10"". Pours a dark amber/burgandy color that produces a nice fluffy head that leaves great lacing. That appearance is stunning. Aroma is sweet spicey and bready that features hints of dark fruits and a bit of alcohol. Mouthfeel is light and dry with a high level of carbonation. Taste is predominately yeasty with some alcohol phenols and nuts. This is a very good brew from an excellent brewery but the 6 does not even compare to the 8 and 10."
"Drinkability/Overall: very drinkable, loads of complexity and development for their ""small"" beer. Very aromatic as it warms, a pleasant surprise in my first of the 3 Rocheforts."
"Cheers!"
"Drinkability: This is the most drinkable of the Rochefort line, it is at once chewy and smooth. Well worth a look as it will be much more readily available in the US now."
"This beer poured a very light amber, with yeastyclumps settling to the botom, it had a tiny head and very little lacing. the aroma was farily sweet but it was hard to describe beyond that. The flavor was tart, and sweet, and very smooth. the finish left some tartness and a little alcohol lingering on the back of the toung, the mouthfeel was a littel watery, not as full or carbonated thatn the other rochfort beers that I have had and love. overall I found it to be a reasonable beer, but nothing really stood out for me all that much."
"Drinkability - I'd get this again, was quite refreshing and a really pleasent change of pace from the styles I tend to gravitate to."
"A very unique beer in my experience. Excellent."
"Poured a dark muddy brown. Large head, light tan. Aroma was sweet, raisins and roses, some other fruits as well that I could not identify. Taste was not as sweet as smell would lead you to expect, but did not deviate in flavors. Raisins, port wine, yeast, and some pepper at finish. Mouthfeel was highly carbonated and somewhat drying. A very enjoyable beer."
"A very nice beer, not much more to say. Tasty and easy drinking."
"Drinkabililty: this is a very drinkable brew, and worth seeking out as much as the 8 and 10 from this brewery."
"This one reminds me a bit of the Rochefort 8, and a shadow of the 10 but not as lively, or as complex as either."
"This is an outstanding beer (which it should be for the price)."
"Trappistes Rochefort 6 pours a deep, dark copper color with chunks of yeast floating around, with an off white head from a brown 33cl bottle. Smells like a glass of wine, fruity, plum like aromas. Chocolate is definitely the first predominant taste. There are also some fruit like flavors that are not very pronounced. Excellent beer. Recommended."
" I found myself enjoying this one more and nore as it warmed. The smell and the flavors become more pronounced. Drinkable? Yes, but the price could be prohibitive to most."
"Drinkability:"
"Mouthfeel is great. A rush of flavors with a lot of natural effervesence. Dried prunes, roasted nuts, anise, black licorice and slightly medicinal alcohol flavors. Peaty flavors similar to a highland single malt. The alcohol presense is enjoyable without becoming overwhelming. A very complex mix of flavors."
"When I can buy Rochefort 10 & 8 for the same price at my local store, I'm not sure why many people would choose this one over those two fantastic offerings. Certainly a good Belgian and a tasty treat, but I'll pick it's big brothers over this any day of the week."
"This brew has a quenching quality that most of its ilk do not have. Tasty and easy to drink. Wish it were cheaper..."
"D - Good for the ABV."
" I tried another of this beer from the same date years ago and it has improved immensly with time. It is fabulous and worth trying, though I believe at this age both the roch. 8 and 10 are superior."
"Overall: A great Belgian Dark, in my opinion better than Rochefort #8 due to the simpler (less cluttered and overwhelming) palate. Definitely recommended."
"Well, those people in the local area coveting this stuff can rest easier at night now, because this isn't really an ale I'd like to revisit, more for you. Pretty anti-climactic after all of the hype. Glad I started at the bottom, it can only go up from here (I hope)."
"Number 6, red cap. I was curious to see how it would match up against its bigger brothers. Rochefort 6 definitely pours out with the lightest colour of the 3, as expected. Nice hazy iced-tea or dark peach-juice colour with a cream-white head that settled nicely and moved slowly leaving some viscous lace. Very nice looking beer. The aroma is very earthy and tea-like, with less phenols and even a little hopping beginning to show through(something I could not detect at all in the 8 and 10.) Very similar malt aromas as the 8 and 10, and even some light metallic citrus aromas come out. Other notes of pasta, yeast, dusty chocolate, and salt. Light nuttiness, fresh white bread, grapes and green vegetables. Just as complex as the 8, in my opinion. The first taste has sourish malts and in the middle is metallic phenols, where the alcohol can be tasted. The finish is the best part of the taste, where grainy bread mixes with the softest hint of hops and coffee to form a pleasant and lingering aftertaste. Light caramel and a certain dusty yeasty flavour which I find in Gouden Carolus Classic. The taste reveals more port-like alcohol as you exhale, but obviously not as much as the other Rocheforts. As with all of the Rochefort beers, this warms the stomach nicely. The 6 has all the drinkability, with the least harsh alcohol feel out of the 3. Since the 3 beers are all the same recipe, they DO share many characteristics save the bite of alcohol content. That being said, the 6 really does taste the most uncomplex, with the beer's flavour at its basic. However, it allows some tastes to shine through, such as the light hopping and the graininess of the malt. Still a lovely tasting brew. Medium carbonation, medium body, and full drinkability."
"Overall - An excellent beer.... Recommended... Not quite as good as the other two Rochefort brews but not far off..."
"D: I like this one better than the 8 and 10, but like them, I think there are much better beers to be had for less $$."
"I liked Rochefort 6, but this one is very overshadowed by the 8 and 10. Still a very nice beer."
"Overall this is a fine beer but its just a bit light in terms of flavor and body to stand up to the truly great BSDAs. I would just like a little bit more from this one. Still very enjoyable and very drinkable."
"Nice beer, certainly can enjoy another. So get if you can."
"Medium brown color, cloudy, with quarter inch white head, decent retention. Plenty of visible active carbonation and fine lacing also. Smell has notes of subtle grape, nutty chocolate, rasin, and a bit of spice. Taste is sweet and raisiny, which fades some after a moment, finish is slightly chocolatey and alcoholic. Flavors of belgian yeast are noticible and it it also has a slight bitterness. The mouthfeel is really nice on this one, loads of carbonation, medium thickness, very smooth and coating. Drinkablity scores well as the alcohol is not overly strong, but the flavor is not as imaginitive as the Rochefort 8, nor the 10. You still have to try it though..."
"Flavor is oddly simple. I was expecting a bit more (second beer tonite that did that to me). Bit fruity and juicy at first. Kind of like a crushed some apples, grapes and pears into a glass and drank it. Little bit of spice. I can just detect the alcohol. Medium body and actually a bit watery. Did not improve as the beer warmed and I actually thought it got worse."
"Dont overlook this one. While Trapist makes other fine offerings, this one is still a great beer. It is very well rounded and has many good qualities. Fine beer."
"Not what I expected at all but still very good. I did expect the sweet notes all the way through but also some bitterness to balance it out. But what do I know, they have been doing it a lot longer than I have been around. Cheers to my inlaws!"
"Bubbles gush forth from the semi-hazy medium brown body upon decanting. A decent head forms quickly but soon dissipates. The nose is slightly sulphury, a touch metallic perhaps, and also shows light dried fruit and spice. The palate consists of an extremely smooth melding of flavors. Soft, round malt is followed by a gentle bitterness, which blends easily into a tart finish. The robust alcohol finally begins to make its presence known in the form of a nice warmth that settles deep in the stomach."
"Poured from a regular ol' 11.2 oz bottle into my St. Bernardus chalice. Poured a nice dark amber/brown with a decent off-white head that dissipated quickly, leaving some faint lacing. Smell was the best part of this beer for me, with strong dark fruity flavors and brown sugariness, along with a bit of malt and a trace of alcohol. The taste didn't quite live up to the smell, with basically the same flavors, just not as strong. I like a bit of warmth and sweetness from the alcohol, but I didn't taste it really at all from this beer. A bit of carbonation and very smooth mouthfeel, with an overall decent drinkability. I would just rather have a beer with more flavor."
"Pours a good head that falls into a thin head with a fairly strong lacing. Color is dark to amber when held up to the light. A good, sweet scent that has a slight smokey undertone to it. It also has a nutmeg undertone that's a little more suttle. The mouthfeel is nice and crisp and well carbonated."
"Another solid offering by Rochefort. A well aged, and uniquely flavored beer. Looks ideal for a belgian. A dark, burgundy color wit a mild haze and floating yeast. A lightly tanned head that rides to the bottom of the glass with hints of spices sprinkled on top. Smells of matured malts, woodsyness, nuttiness, musky, and a little moldy. Tastes of complex malts, interwoven hops, yeast, bread, almonds, and fruitcake are well melded and difficult to identify individual flavors. Full and rich on the mouth without and overbearing sweetness or becomming chewy. Pronounced alcohol flavor and feel for a mere 7.5%er. This beer is a lot of fun to drink."
"light, smooth mouthfeel with just enough carbonation. very bready with a subtle sweetness, toffee and caramel, and a surprisingly clean, dry finish. it all adds up to a very drinkable rochefort, but i much prefer the 10."
"Prosit!"
"Poured this beer into a chalice from the 11.2 oz bottle. Its color is a medium brown/amber with very little head that is a light tan. However, it has moderate carbonation. The smell is a very light malty and sweet scent. It has a light and fizzy mouthfeel but not much taste; I have found this true for all three of the Rochefort beers. I keep waiting for the flavor to kick in and it doesnt. It has all the earmarks of a great beer but just doesnt deliver on the flavor. My favorite out of the three was the 8, followed by the 10. Its drinkable, but why when I can find better Trappist beers."
"D- This is a very smooth drinking beer with nice characterisic to the flavor but there didn't seem to be the richness and complexity that I have tasted in other from this style."
"Deep ruby/mahagony with a tan frothy head. Smells faintly of leather with candy sweetness and a slight fruit tang. Flavors of light belgian caramel syrupy sweetness leads the way on the tongue with some notes of unmalted grains slightly rotted, and perhaps a hint of chocolate. No real bitterness, but a hint of sourness does finish up the flavor. Forthy light belgian body for a decent, but not my favorite style, belgian ale. Drinkable, but at the price, I won't likely pick it up again."
"Cloudy brown, yeast particles, huge off-white head, and not so much lacing as a coating of foam on the glass. I was expecting a more active nose...maybe the nose that lacks is mine...there were no heavy fruits or candi odors, just a clean thick malty smell without much else. But the taste...well, this is smooth malts with the mellow dark fruits and candi finally coming through. Full satisfying mouthfeel. Outstanding drinkability. Nothing prevents you from wanting a few of these. Why is this not available in a 750ml?"
"I was never really crazy about the other rocheforts, but this is actually pretty good. Still very subtle and not my favorite trappist brewery, but not to bad. Almost a session beer sort of trappist, not to huge with a good mix of malts."
"D - Very good drinkability. The flavors aren't as complex as the 8 or 10 but still very interesting. A nice drinkable beer overall."
"Mouthfeel is full and creamy with a not-quite-big body that leaves you wanting to take another sip right away."
"This is a fantastic brew. Pours a very cloudy earth brown colour with plenty of sediment and little bits floating inside it. Offwhite foamy head that doesn't last too long leaves moderate lacing. This is a nice looking brew, to me anyway. The smell is indeed quite sweet and reminds one of caramel and candied fruits. The smell is very pleasant and not at all over powering. A joy. The taste is magnificent. Very easy to drink and full of flavour. No sign of elevated alcohol. Smooth. Plenty of malt. Sweet and toasted sensations wash over your tongue at first. Nice finish with very, very weak and subtle hops trying to show themselves. This is very close to being my perfect brew. Nice low level of carbonation, plenty of flavour, lots of malt, nearly void of hops. It has a great colour and at 7,5%abv it isn't so big you can't handle a couple of them. I have had the others in this run, and I must say that I don't care for No. 10 and actually like No. 6 and No. 8 much better. This is good stuff!!"
"The mouth feel of this beer is pretty good. It is moderately heavy on the palate and high in carbonation. Feels appropriate to the style on the palate. I think that perhaps if the body were a bit fuller or if it were heavier on the palate it would add something to the brew. I would definitely buy this beer again, however if I had a choice between this and Chimay Blue, I'd choose Chimay Blue. It's very good but I think that Chimay beats this one in taste for this style."
"Overall, a very nice dark ale. I will definitely have this again. It was fantastic with some smoked gouda I had laying around. Woudl love to try it with BBQ."
"I guess I am spoiled by huge ABV's. At 7.5 it certainly holds its own, but not the kick I was anticipating."
"Mouthfeel is rather light with a champagne like carbonation that bounces off of every side of the mouth. I'm usually not a fan of high carbonation but it works well with this brew. I would drink this all night if given the chance and I'm glad I have another bottle awaiting me in the cellar. Just noticed the best by date is 21-10-08....which just happens to be my birthday as well. The monks of Abbaye St-Remy deserve high praise for this lovely brew."
"I am sad and ashamed that this is my only sample. I will buy this one again, even at the premium price..."
"Not quite a filling and powerful as it's big brother Rochefort 8. Poured out to a dark gold / brown color that had a hint of reddness when held to the light. Nice white foamy head was about 3/4 of an inch and maintained itself well. Good notes of lacing in the glass. Aromas of malt and grain were weak but still observable. Not bad. Taste is good; flavors of malt, yeast and grain are noted, along with some dark fruits toward the finish. Nice mouthfeel was filling and accented well by the crisp carbonation. Good drinkability. A solid beer and a good place to start when getting aquainted with Dark Belgian Ales. Recommended."
"It's the cheapest one in price of all the Rochefort varieties, but you should still try. I was a little hesitant at first (because of the 8 and 10), and then decided to go for it. Soon enough I'll review the 10, as I've had it but it was at the Brickskeller and I wasn't taking notes. Rochefort can do nothing but right as far as I'm concerned."
"Very, very good. Definitely a beer to try."
"This is a very drinkable beer and I highly recommend it. I like this one a little better than the 8. I am going to try the 10 next."
"the 6 and the 8 are clearly two children of the same parents: similar flavors and aromas, though in varying characters"
"Drinkability is dangerous."
"Finally reviewed. Pours a very cloudy dark brown, with an orange hue on the edges, big head forms but goes fast however leaves a generous thick layer of head that stays until the end of the glass, impressive lacing as well. Smell is fruity, strawberries and cherries, dark chocolate, some spices like cloves in the finish. The taste is dark fruits, smooth dark chocolate, some alcohol, spice, myriad of flavours. Very smooth, warming, medium carbonation and a clean bitter finish. Amazing beer, like all Rocheforts."
"Drinkability- My first sampling of a Rochefort brew and so far I am impressed. Wish I has another I could age for a year or two and compare. Otherwise I would definitely recommend this brew even as is."
"Pours a murky brown color with a huge fluffy white head. The aroma is fruity and nutty. Very pleasant. The taste is strong at first but seems to fade. Very strange, but not bad though. Fruity and nutty with some nice alcohol peaking through. The mouthfeel is medium bodied. Overall, this is an alright brew."
"A great dark ale, like the session version of their 10, not as flavourful but great none the less"
"Deep, reddish auburn colour with a light haze. Rocky tan head with good retention and lacing. Plenty of aroma, dark fruits, dates, prunes, sugar, and light alcohol. Some caramel as it warms. Malty sweetness to start, followed by ripe fruitiness and alcohol flavour/warmth at the very end. Also a little vinous and peppery. The body is on the lighter side, not bad at all, high carbonation gives it an airy texture and produces constant bubbling for quite some time. My first from Rochefort and it certainly won't be my last!"
"Reviewed this about a month ago, but I got this bottle from babydoc (ala BIF20) and am thus obligated to review it. Thanks for the second chance! Bottle date says 04 02 08. Pours a thin lyaer of light brown head over a very cloudy, well, actually it's a muddy brown liquid. Sediment was retained in the bottle. Smells of chocolate, belgian candy sugar, anise, and a very gentle alcohol sting. Tastes take a moment ot settle in. Alcohol is a base from start to finish which other flavors play on. Weak chocolate, some toffee/caramelly, raisins, and a hint of funk. The aftertaste is a persistent chocolate with a tinge of cherry sour that makes me enjoy pondering each sip. Medium body and moderately (but sharply) carbonated."
"Drinkability - Awesome beer, however... I think it is too good to drink too much of (if that makes any sense)."
"A well made beer that is very easy to drink and the 7.5% abv is incredibly hidden. A good belgian for sure."
"It's not my favorite style, but based on others I have had, it was better than average. But it didn't knock my socks off."
"330 ml bottle, at the 32nd Cambridge Beer Festival. Served directly from the fridge. Had to wait half an hour before I could drink it. Strange thing with British pubs and beer festivals - theyre very conscious that their native cask ales should be served at cellar temperatures, but foreign bottled beers are served ice cold, no matter what! Barnyard aroma with notes of dried fruits and oak, improves as the beer warms up. Flavour has much of the same elements as Rochefort 8 and 10, just on a more moderate scale. Dried fruits, brown sugar, tobacco, oak."
"Drinkability: Authentic yes; impressive, no. I'm a bit biased -- this has never been a favorite style -- but given the hype and stern price, this is a disappointment. Unibroue's Trois Pistoles and this year's Stone Vertial Epic are much more appealing and far less expensive. If you must drink a Rochefort, the 10 is a far more satisfying effort."
"From notes. Poured a slightly ambered brown color with a 2 finger head that fell to a nice bubbly blanket over top of the brew. The nose was slight molasses and raisiney sweet with a bit of spiceyness playing around in there as well. The flavor was light raisiney and sweet brown sugar. It just seemed a little thin to me on the flavor. I expected something more robust on the tongue. The feel was a thin moderate with a very active carbonation, almost burning and too much on the tongue. Overall, a pretty good brew. The carbonation really detracted from the beer in my opinion. It interfered with my ability to really get the flavors and the feel of the brew."
"body is creamy, partially due to the foaminess and bready body. smooth in the mouth but thickness and intense flavor limits drinkability. not my favorite trappist, but a solid beer nonetheless. interested to see what a year would do, seems a bit too fresh."
"The flavor is where the breadiness takes over. Bread and grainy flavors. Big malty flavors. Hints of caramel. Spicy with just a tinge of underlying alcohol burn. Thick and rich in the mouth. Luxurious palate. Whoa boy is this tasty. Bravo to this one."
"Gone in a flash! Slides right down without much effort at all. But I still prefer the 8 by Rochefort if I'm gonna get anything by them."
"OH MY GOD. This is truly heaven sent beer. The pour and aroma are nothing short of amazing. Smells sweet and caramel like, head is thick and white. Lacing is long lasting and the color is a beautiful mahogany brown. The taste is where this beer really shines through, it is lively with perfect sweetness on the palate. I thought a $ 6.00 bottle of beer was a bit pricey, but this is worth every penny. My new favorite beer."
"Thanks to HardTarget for genorously sharing this great beer."
"Poured a cloudy brown with a lot of visible carbonation. Head was generous and is leaving a sticky lacing. Nose is a pleasant boquet of fruity malts. Taste has been extroadinarily interesting as I get a different taste with each bite of my leftover Claim Jumper dinner. Depending on what I am tasting I either get a real fruity malt dry finished taste or a heavy malty ale taste. Mouthfeel is full and ever so lively on my palate. Overall drinkability is awesome, the 7.5% abv is well hidden! This is an awesome beer which despite the price is worth another taste in the future!"
"The mouthfeel is full, slightly chewy, but velvety as it glides around the tongue. This is the most drinkably trappist I've encountered so far."
"A great all around beer. Pours a cloudy brown color with little flakes floating around in it, and a moderate sized head. Smell hints of apricots, but really has a unique smell similar to the 8 and 10 Rocheforts. The taste is wonderful. Slight carbonation, but the main taste is fruity but dull... a bit like unsweetened apple juice. Also a bit of carmel in the finish, but hard to look for. A must-try beer."
"Pours a ruddy brown with some reddish hue with a big fluffy head that leaves generous amounts of lace as it settles,caramel is prominant in the aroma as well as some clove/spice and orange oh hell yeah.Wow complexities abound flavor wise some chocolate up front with some roasted malt and a little caramel along with an underlying orange/fruitiness, but a pleasant dry finish keeps it from getting to sweet.Damn fine brew here full of different rich flavors,one to savor."
"Finish is dry and a little tannic."
"While this is my least favorite of the Rochefort beers, it's still a treat."
"Overall Impression: Wow, another outstanding example from Rochefort. While this is not as transcendent as the older brothers of the family, it is none the less an outstanding beer. Strongly recommended!"
"This Belgian ale poured a cloudy, brown with a touch of red color with creamy, fluffy, light tan foam that persisted and clung to the glass. There was also a steady stream of fine bubbles from the bottom of the chalice. Very nice. The smell was lightly sweet and malty with a touch of caramel and a very faint hint of banana. The aroma improved as the beer warmed. The taste was malty and lightly sweet with a touch of caramel a very light sugary flavor. The hop presence was low. The mouthfeel was smooth and creamy and airy with medium body and strong carbonation. The aftertaste was light. This was a very nice, smooth and mellow beer. Very enjoyable."
"Good beer. I got to thinking and I believe that this was my first Rochefort ever. There is an 8 tucked away somewhere in my pantry that I need to try really soon."
"Another excellent beer from Rochefort. I don't know what these monks eat that they make such good brews, but I sure as hell want some of it!"
"Drinkability and Overall: Phenomenal. Rochefort is always on top of their game, and this beer is no different. I love it. Love it love it love it."
"Drinkability is also good; only litlebit tempted by the ernormous amount of bubbles. More then just a good brew"
"A wonderful beer,though some Coco-cola colours . Dark amber brown colour. Cinammon smell. Warming cinammon mouthfeel. Licorice, fruity spice, raspberry,vanilla. Excellent malt toffee but not to make it on swethe et side. Perfect hop assist.Very good to drink at a moderate pace.Great 7 years later, bottle aged for 3 years."
"Very mellow, but far from mild. I admire the unique flavor more as it finds a home in my mouth. Medium bodied, long, fruity finish, very much deliciousness. I'm very happy with this one, and am amazed that this is the first time I've tried it...where have you been all my life? Yum, yum...try this one, please...your happiness is ensured!"
"Best before 4-29-08. Pours a peachy copper color with a volumnous light beige head that stays ¼"" thick throughout the duration of the experience. Lacing is luxurious and absolutely gorgeous. Rich aromas of roasted malts and candi sugars, musty and dusty yeast, light caramel, cocoa/vanilla and a slight nuttiness with nuances of toasted marshmallow. Not only is the aroma excellent, the taste and flavor is equalled to it. This probably has to be one of the most drinkable beers I've ever had. Malty but not very sweet, subtle flaked maize or oat taste, fruitiness is bursting with juicy goodness. Light hop accents with virtually no astringency, just a little dryness. Lightly spritzy on the palate. Jawdroppingly delicious."
"edit: bottle expiration date reads 15-05-07, and the Rochefort website says the bottling date is the expiration date minus 5 years, meaning this particular bottle was 2002 vintage and sitting on the shelves for the past two and a half years. I must say, it was kept in damn well condition... well done, John's Grocery! I am pleased to have finally found a home for this gem... in my belly."
"A big beer in taste thats smooth and nice. Wellbalanced and a good brew."
"This by far is the best Rochefort. It is just exploding with flavour that can not be topped. The aroma is top notch only to be out done ounce you get this wonderful beer on your tongue. When I drink this one it just relaxes me and takes away from the rush of our every day life and takes you to a place you will only understand when you have been to belgium to relax. With the lower alcohol content of the other Rocheforts you can drink this one all night. But even in Belgium this one is harder to come upon but it is out there in most gertrankmarts. I highly recommend this one to anyone looking for a bursting, flavorful beer."
"Its been a few years since I've had the Six, so its nice to see it back again. Hazy darker ginger color with a head that pops up quickly no matter how slow the pour. Laces in large downward dripping marks. Yeasty aroma, trademark fresh detergent notes (its hard to say why this is a good thing here, but it is) with pear sweetness and some cinnamon. Thickish mouthfeel, but well set off by staunchly spritely carbonation. Flavor is fairly big, leafy with lots of cantelope brightness mixed with a dark rum counterpoint. Prickly sense mid mouth to close, hoppy with pine cones, pepper, and star anise licorice. Relatively hot at the back of the throat and warming in the swallow. A well-done brew here."
"This beer lacks the verve of its two older sisters. This is too light for big beer satisfaction and yet has an alcohol level too big for a session beer. That being said it is a nice beer, and would happily drink it without complaint if someone else was buying."
"Bottle: Poured an very hazy dirty brown color ale with a good inch and half of off-white foamy head. Aroma is comprised of spices (coriander?), malt and Belgian yeast. Taste is at first dominated by the spices and malt and finish with the always-incredible Belgian yeast. Body is quite full and alcohol doesnt show through. I also noted quite a few sediment at the bottom of my glass. This is the staple of Belgian ale and could not really get tired of it even though it doesnt match the greatness of his two brothers."
"I really do love Rochefort and this is just another reason why. The body is a hazy medium brown with a fairly large cream-colored head. The aroma has a bit of a bite to it and is very spicy. Theres a bit of overripe fruit (some of it banana) to flesh it out a little. The flavor is nicely malty in addition to the rest, but the body is significantly thinner than that of its bigger brother, the 10."
"33 cl. Code on bottle 15 05 07. Much more subdued in the flavor than expected. Very pleasant to consume."
"Wyll-"
"Soft & sweet, dark fruit works its way around to slightly herbal flavours. Soft, fluffy, brisk carbonation. Excellent."
"Pours out a medium-dark brown color with a nice head that took a while to settle down. Smell consisted of a whole lot of things. Malts, caramel, dark fruits, chocolate, cocoa powder, nuts, and some bready aromas. Taste was just as complex. Actually complex really isn't a good enough word for this beer. It's beyond complex. Bread, malts, yeast, nuts, fruit, cocoa, and at the end some spicy hops finish it off. Moutfeel feels so light and fluffy on the palate it's down right amazing. Truly an amazing beer and one that every BA must try at least once. Worth every penny I spent on this beer."
"Huge and lasting beige rocky head with lots of various forms in the lacing. Body appears reddish deep brown. Dry fruity aroma (peaches, plums, banana, raspberries..). Deep biscuity malt combined with doughy yeast reminds me of vanilla flavored buckwheat pancakes. This is never too sweet, the yeast provides a deep dryness all the way through. Firm medium body with moderate carbonation. Fortunately no acidity nor alcoholic feel. Light hoppy bitter slice toward the end, gets a bit astringent after half the bottle. Lots of wood and cocoa in post-taste. Not a top notch belgian, but flavorful and well rounded."
"Picked up a couple bottles of both 6 and 10 at Kahn's in Indy. This is my first Rochefort. Poured a nice brown with a wonderful large 3 fingered cream head into my Gulden Draak tulip glass. I half expected this beer to be a little darker but it was still pleasing to the eye. Aroma has notes of dark fruits and spice but the aroma never approached overpowering. Taste was also a nice mild flavor with loads of dark fruits and some spicy yeastiness. A nice sweet/creamy finish also makes itself known. Mouthfeel is nice and creamy as well. I could drink this all night... If it weren't 7.5 percent that is. A very very solid brew and I'm continuing my love affair with Belgians. I'm sure I'll get around to sampling the 10 this weekend."
"Rochefort 6 pours a deep, cloudy brown with a thick off-white head that sticks around through the entire glass. Aroma is magnificent - sour fruit, spice and caramel. Taste is spicy (coriander, cloves), bready with a sweet and sour finish. Some port-like and dark chocolate flavors as well. A touch of bitterness in the finish as the brew warms. Slightly heavy mouthfeel with ultra-fine carbonation. An incredible brew; what a mix of flavors!"
"Pours a murky, medium brown color with slight ruby notes (if you look really hard). This bottle had lots of yeast in the bottom. Leaves a nice-looking but very thin head that covers the beer and stays there. Aroma is malty, semi-sweet and fruity (plums, dates, apples, cherries). Flavor is a nice mix of sweet and bready/yeasty. Alcohol profile hidden unlike its bigger brothers. Mouthfeel is very enjoyable- not real heavy on a hot day. Drinkability is high. I really like this compared to the 8 and the 10, because it has many of the same aroma and flavor profiles, but isn't as overpowering. Maybe not as complex because of it, but sometimes that's ok."
"33 cl bottle lugged back from the promised land. Dated 15 05 07. Light brown carbonated look in tyhe goblet. Off white nice head on the pour with nice lacing. Some chunky friends are also present iin the goblet. Nutty brown sugar cookie dough nose. Full smooth mouth. Cocoa and cookie dough taste dominate upfront with a slightly astringent dry plum finish. Interesting, smooth and full flavored."
"Not a bad offering from Rochefort. Nice and mellow Rochefort taste, and not too much in the way of intoxication. Makes me almost want to give up the secular world to become a monk (almost!)"
"Slightly hazed burgandy/scarlet red appearance. Carbonation is visible in the form of rapidly surfcing lines of small bubbles. A thick crop of rocky, dirty white head sits on top. Aroma is sweet, musty, chalky, bready, doughy and a little spicy. The mouthfeel is quite carbonated, light and spritzy, with a body of about light-medium. Subtle toffee tones mix with a little caramel and sweet candy. Just a little pepper spice is noted. Some bubblegum esters and light biscuit tones accent nicely as well. Just the slightest bit of hop derived bitterness. Drinkability is quite high. This is 7.5% a/v?? Can't taste any. Nice effort."
"This dryness quickly becomes the primary sensation as the beer leaves teh palate. It makes a man thirst for his next sip!"
"HIGHLY Recommended."
"Pours out to a dark brown in the glass with a large head. Very active carbonation. Aroma is that of fruit, malt and fresh bread. Taste is that of plums, raisins, anise and light chocolate. Tasty, with a very distinct yeast profile. Not as good as the ""6" or ""10"" in the Rochefort line, but still wonderful. A very good beer."
"This beer pours a very clear tea-like color with a nice fluffy off-white head that looks very inviting. The smell is a mellow fruit, yeast and alcohol that is overall very un pronounced. Taste is a little bit of raison with with light spicy hops and a warming alcohol. This is a light bodied beer that finishes slightly dry. Although subtle in smell and somewhat in taste, it is not deficient in complexity and is very drinkable for a beer of this style. Op uw gezonheid!"
"Can always drink a Rcohefort, usually one is enough but I think I drink a few of these in one sitting."
"Hazy dark cider color with a beige head of fine, uniformly shaped bubbles that rise up and leave a half inch of foam sitting atop the glass. The head recedes a bit, but leaves a thin coating for the duration of the glass. Aroma is of pear and sweet malts, plus some cinnamon. Mouthfeel is smooth, the carbonation is perfect. Flavor is rich, but not overpowering. Not one distinct flavor, but many flavors that move in and out, and develop as the glass warms. There is smooth warming malt, sweet pear, cinnamon and honey, and plum. There is a citric hop tingle in the finish, very subtle though. Finishes crisp, a bit tannic, perhaps a little chalky. Bits of cocoa develop on the tongue as the aftertaste lingers. Twelve ounces is not enough for this beer. Thanks to MJR."
"Thick tan head eventually fades to a thin coating and left a solid coating as it sank. The aroma is of dark chocolate, cherries, and doughy malt. The beer is dark cider brown where the glass is the widest, and begins to glow towards the bottom of the The flavor is well balanced and understated; light malt flavor, a bit of tangy bubbly fruit, and a couple other things I'm gonna go crazy trying to decipher. The liquid seems to float accross the tongue, very light and soothing, and warming as it settles into your stomach . Nice finish, very light aftertaste with a pinch of lightly bitter chocolate."
"The bottle opens with a pronounced pfft when I pop the cap. This beer pours a deep reddish copper color when held up to the light, otherwise it is a deep amber color. It is lightly hazy and is topped by a creamy off white head. Quite a fruity aroma with notes of plum, raisin and rum. The fruitiness caries through to the taste, with hints of apricot and in the finish a bit of banana. This beer seems to be sweet, but is in actuality fairly dry. The general fruitiness helps to build up the perception of sweetness. No alcohol is evident, this one hides it well. Quite a smooth beer, well put together, the flavors come together to form a balanced whole. There is a low level of Belgian spiciness here (esters, higher alcohols, etc.) that melds very well with the fruity notes. I must say I really like this beer. Not as complex as the Bernardus Pater 6, but I like it better."
"Plenty good for a quaffer, I suppose. I wanted a bit of an experience. I got bland. And a wallet $6 drier."
"Dark brown hue with tawny influences, light brunette head, reached a tickle over a fingers worth. Fair retention, it sinks to an incomplete cap. Minimal lace. The nose was peppery/spicy, light alcohol, candied sugar, malty. A very pleasant bouquet, good potency. Inviting. Tasty palate, dry coffee, semi-sweet chocolate upfront with pepper in the middle, quickly followed by the bready maltiness, kisses of fruity-alcohol, candy sugar the finish on the bier is magical. Champagne-like carbonation. Medium body. It might not pack the alcohol punch of his big brothers but dont sleep on 6, it is a very quality quaff. Recommended."
"Drinkability  After falling in love with the 8 some time ago, it was nice to try this weaker cousin. The ABV is down but the flavors are right on target. Well done."
"Medium brown color. Large head. Aroma is malty, bananas, fruity and bready. A medium bodied dubbel. Malts are bready and sweet. Hops are slightly spicy. Deep rich malt flavors. Smooth taste. Crisp and bright yeasts. Well balanced. Touch of banana flavors. Nice beer. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and sweet. Aftertaste is slightly sweet."
"Turbid ruddy chestnut hue. Dogged, light beige head with dense, soft peak consistency. Loosely tattered lace trails. The aroma is initially an evened melange of lightly sugary plum, mellow carob and dark candi sugar caramel notes. As the beer breathes, clove phenol and hints of peppery alcohol surface. Understated and welcoming aromawise. Ashen, nut studded banana bread sweetness incipient in flavor lingers, then after a deliberation is complemented by a stately dark fruit presence of a plum and woody, dried date nature. Tepid notes of black licorice and salty biscuit arise late and lend an unexpected, but welcome savory contrast. Lightly bodied and quite lean overall, with a dryish, fluid mouthfeel indicative of ample usage of candi sugar. Quite well attenuated. Finishes with a brief surge of herbal phenol yielding to lingering notes of dry, powered, unsweetened cocoa. Rochefort 6 is an exceptionally balanced, soft beer that awakens and sits lightly on the palate. Its inherent tameness works well... An ideal evening would be a progressive tasting of the Rochefort 6, then 8, then 10."
"I bought the 6, 8, and 10 a couple days ago and decided to try them in that order. At $5.99 a pop for 33cl these better be some damn fine beers, and the 6 was not a disappointment. Aromas of plums and raisins with a malty backbone hinted at what was to come. The dark red brown body was well carbonated but produced very little head. The taste was of dark fruits, chocolate, and toffee with a nice dry bitterness. Really a very good beer, but not good enough for me to make a habit of. Everyone should try it, but there are many beers every bit its equal for half the price."
"Don't get me wrong. This is an appealing beer. On the palate it is creamy, easy and just suggestive of French roast, cherries and frothy milk. Give it to your friends who suckle Boddingtons. They might come around. As for me, I'll take a living beer brewed by monks every time, even if it wasn't so darn gosh silky."
"This was the first of a Rochefort trilogy at a recent beer tasting. The 6 O.G. Is mahogany or old brown leather in color. A big foamy and fizzy beige head lasts. Trails of sticky lace cling in places and bits of yeast float in suspended animation after gently rolling the bottle before opening. A damp earth, malt and slightly sour aroma prevail. Not overly malty or hoppy. Notes of caramel, light cloves and a hint of pine finish this rather dry Trappist."
"This brew poured a very envigorated large creamy head of fine off-white bubbles that left a good lacoing and a carbonated cloudy yeasty opaque brown body. Its flavor is comparatively complex like its bretheren the 8 and the 10, but it is much thinner. The flavors of roasted malt and spices and in there just like its kin, but not as silky smooth as the 8 and with less bite than the 10. Still, an excellent brew!"
"This Abbel Dubbel poured a large invigorating tan long lasting head with fine-small bubbles. There was good lacing on all sides of my glass. The aroma was somewhat fruity. The body was a cloudy light brown color and it was thin and watery. It had a tingly taste to it and I prefer the Rochefort Trappistes 8 to this one."
"A surprisingly aromatic brew, I caught whiff of light alcohol aromas as soon as I cracked the bottle. Poured out with colors like a big malted milk ball -- dark brown with a cream-colored head. The head really looked like a big kitchen sponge -- thick and porous. Aroma was almost that of some sort of red wine with prunes and alcohol -- lemon pine sol and melon too. Kind of light and bread-like up front with a reasonably strong alcoholic and bitter finish. Fairly easy to drink for a beer of its strength. The alcohol is noticeable but balanced and under control. Smooth. No extremes."
"This beer pours a cloudy brown as do the other Rochefort beers. The aroma is very much the same as the others too. The taste is not as strong as the 8 or the 10 but it has a very strong hint of coffee - which I did not care for. I recommend the 8 over all others."
"-F"
"Quite stunning in appearance: the color of autumn leaves , with a thick, creamy, off-white head that leaves a huge lace. The aroma is spicy and bready, though a bit weak. These two characteristics dominate the flavor as well. Mid-palate gives way to a deep-fruitiness, giving me the impression of something like raisin-bread. Very smoothly-blended and gentle, with a creamy body and a finish which is just barely sweet. What drying effect there is seems to come more from the alcohol than the hops, which are fairly mild. A really, really nice beer!"
"Drinkability: I'm not so sure I could drink this on a regular basis, as I can name several other Trappist brews that are head and shoulders above it. Pretty good, but not great."
"Small 330 ml bottle pours a murky brown color with a huge frothy and creamy off-white head that lasts, light malt and somewhat spicy aroma. Very mild fruity and bready flavor, medium body with very lively carbonation nice clean finish a bit watery palate, very smooth and drinkable alcohol is well hiddin. Lighter than the 8 and 10, still a great brew."
"The beer pours a bit of a hazy purple to dark red color with the head pertinent in size, frothy in texture and the lace fine long lasting sheets. Vinous lots of malt, fruit sweet, quite pleasant to sniff with the start ambrosial and the top skinny in feel. Finish is astringent, pleasantly hopped and a nice dry lingering aftertaste. A good beer, not as good as the 8/10, but still a top notch beer nonetheless."
"Drinkability & Notes: This beer is too highly seated to be all alone, some soft cheeses and crackers are an excellent union to take the taste buds to a higher level."
"429"
"This beer poured a dark amber and formed a huge sudsy-foamy off white head that circular lace. Heavy amount of carbonation. An aroma of malt, caramel and spice. A flavor of of malt and spice with some sudsy aspect to the mouthfeel no doubt due to the carbonation. I found the flavor to be a a touch weak compared to others of this style."
"Pretty good, but the 8 and 10 are way better, this was a bit sweet, and lacked a bit of character, this however, was very good, i'm only really comparing it to the 8 and the 10. Nice spicy chocolate flavour, but not as aromatic or as tasty as the other two."
