"I may have had an unusual experience, but there is inconsistency between bottles. Some are closer to a sour than an ale, and with the sour bottles the carbonation is overwhelming. On draft, it is much better and is closer to the dubbel in flavor."

"Drinking this beer as I review, very good my favorite from db"

"Amazingly close to  Chimay. Its a good substitute."

"Very good flavor. Very drinkable.  Cant find it in a 12 pk. Looking forward to trying it at their brewpub soon."

"Raisins, cherry cordials, banana esters on the nose. Nice deep maroon color. Dried fruit (cherries, figs, plums), some clove, and noticeable honey. Finishes sweet. Smooth and slightly velvety, and wamr on the throat. A bit on the sweet side but impressed by how it's so easy to drink."
"O: Overall a decent beer for when you are in the mood for a nice dark Belgian style.. Interesting, and new."

"12oz bottle poured into shaker pint. Dark amber body with a ring of tan bubbles that disappear quickly. No lacing. Aroma is of brown sugar, raisins, figs, a touch of banana, and malt. Taste is carried by a moderate raisin sweetness with a lower level of yeasty spice and a small amount of earthy bitterness. Medium-light body, thin texture, soft carbonation, a little alcohol on the finish."

"Dark mahogany auburn body with a thin beige cap. Brown bread, yeast, brown sugar. Dark fruit notes, particularly raisins and plums. Like to medium and body with moderate sweetness, just like Adam's mom."
"VERY TIMID.  INCONSISTENT CARBONATION FROM BOTTLE TO BOTTLE."
"This is my new favorite. Spicing is fruity. Slightly punchier alcohol kick than expected."
"Too much on the ""with spices"" side and not enough on the ""ale"" side, and not nearly carbonated enough for a Belgian style."

"Loving this brew, looks like a Dubbel  so we are squared away there. Sweet nose of dark malts, raisins, caramel, and spice with a kick of alcohol. Sweet palate, dried plums, slightly warming, balanced spicing, mild phenols, dark sugar, mild broth, & modest hopping show a quite complex brew ... well within the style and a great sipper."

"Picked this up as part of mixed six to give a try. I tend to like Belgians but have little experience with Devils Backbone so not sure what to expect. Love the color, I will call it Deep Purple. Very little head or carbonation. Excellent smell, you definitely get the Belgian in the nose. Mixed bag with the taste. Interesting and tasty, balanced. Pretty easy to drink which gives it a little bonus overall due to alcohol content. I enjoyed the beer and would gladly drink again and would probably buy depending upon the cost."

"O- A surprisingly poor effort from DB. Not a lot here and the lack of body and carbonation makes it even more unimpressive."

"O- decent but without amazing qualities."

"Overall would say its an easy drinking dubbel when you are not looking to analyze every sip. Might be purchasing this again for a sessionable ale, with some dubbel flavors."
""
""
"After finishing the 6 pack I think my review has to stand. I had a couple that were OK, but 4/6 being unpleasant isn't good enough to change the review. Inconsistent? Bad processes? Bad distributor or Store? Who knows, but I'll steer clear of this brew for a while."
""
""
"Maybe I was swayed by the 7.5% ABV, but this beer just hit the spot for me. It's not horribly complex, and yet it left me feeling utterly satisfied. I'd definitely try it again."

"O- some good flavors going on, but it seems to fall off at the end. I enjoyed the dark cherry notes, but wish they would have stayed to the finish"
""
""
"Pours into a goblet an amber hued chesnut brown with a thinner slight off white head atop.Maybe the cleanest aroms of any dubbel that I have come across,some light fige and raisin but it's really light.Lightly carbonated and a little thinner than most of the style I have come across.Flavors are on the lighter side with dark fruit and sweet alcohol notes,some phenol spiciness plays a small role.I have really liked the other DB offerings I have had,this not so much."

"O: Not a bad beer, but not particularly good. It seems that you can only get so much flavor out of a Belgian style beer without bottle fermenting. The beer is heavily front-loaded, and the end could use some more hop character. That being said, it has some good flavors, is sweet without being cloying, and is quite drinkable"

"Overall â€“ An OK dubbel, although a little to bitter and tanniny in flavor for me."
""

"I also don't think I would want to drink this as a session beer. One or two would be fine."
""
""
"O: A really fine Belgian ale from DB. I thought Azrael was pretty good too, so they are starting to hit their stride in a style besides lagers. If you like a bit more sweetness and yeast character in your dubbel, this is a great beer for you."
""
"O: This is a beer that needs to be slowly sipped but is a good representation of the style."
"with Belgian breweris being the benchmark for this style, this is a great example from the other side of the pond. well done!"
