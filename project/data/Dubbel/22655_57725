3.39,-10.8,3.5,3.75,3.25,3.25,3.25,"A solid, dark, chocolate-banana dubbel that's very drinkable but, nevertheless, not expressly exciting.  A sharp, bitter thickness appends the expected deep-brown sweetness, but beyond some banana esters there isn't a lot going o with the flavors of this beer.  And yet: it's damn solid.  Indeed, for a dubbel, it's downright fairly sessionableâ€”particularly since its mouthfeel isn't too sticky (for its genre).  All in all: not incredible, but credibly constructed to a decent number of steps above tolerable.","OrestesMethuon","Nov 28, 2014"

3.9,2.6,4.25,4.25,3.75,3.75,3.75,"Despite a really solid, cool smell and a wonderful look and pour, Straight to Ale's Dubbel is a bit fruitier than I was expecting. It's certainly not bad, but not necessarily my preferred taste. I suspect their IPAs are so prolific and popular for a reason. Straight to Ale might just be a brewery more geared toward American IPAs like Monkeynaut or Snakehandler, which are both highly recommended.","thestarkness01","Dec 23, 2012"

3.83,0.8,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"I am having a hard time believing I am the first to review this one, but its the only dubbel I see by this brewery and the menu cleary said Straight to Ale Belgian Dubble. So...it was a great interpretation from a small craft brewery on a dubbel. A nice dark copper with a thick white head that faded fast but left nice lace. The smell had faint belgian yeast on top of a caramel and honey toned backbone with some spicy elements. A bit of a watered down version on the taste for the style, but very drinkable. Unmistakable on the belgian yeast profiles with spicy and fruity characters coming through a caramel backbone with hints of cocoa and cinamon. Very good drink. Easy to down.","JayS2629","0"
