"Overall, my favorite brew from Ommegang. They absolutely nail the flavors in this one."
"Nice nutty flavor with some spice."
""
""

""
""
""
""
"O: [2.75] I think all Ommegang beers have the same flavor profile and I don't like it.  I am sure it is some peoples' thing - but it's not mine.  This one looked decent in the glass but it went downhill from there.  I have had this one in the fridge for a long time.  I kept passing it over in fear that I would not like it.  I was right.  The Belgian flavor profile just doesn't work for me.  Lesson learned."
""
""
""
"One of the best beers I've ever had."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This is an exquisite beer. Ommegang knows exactly what they are doing when it comes to this sort of beer and they have yet to disappoint. This is an absolute knockout beer that I have as of yet been able to consume more than one of at a time. Definitely seek this one out and you will not be disappointed."
""
""
""
""
"o: My favorite Ommegang."
"Outstanding example of a Dubbel.  I'm still learning to distinguish one taste and smell from another, but I drink enough of these things to  know when one is good, and one is not haha."
""
""
""
""
""
"Wow! Such a well balanced Abbey. Mild notes of fruit, hints of spice, and yeast backbone are just right too me. There is not one negative thing to say about the tastes from start to finish. For a 8.2% ABV, it's only noticed with a slight warming tingle.  Will buy again...by the case. Well done again Ommegang!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Wow, an all around delicious abbey ale. Smooth and well balanced."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"One of the better Dubbel's ive ever tried."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Beautiful. Great mouth feel and very complex flavor. Well balanced while still being very pungent and memorable."
"Excellent. very dark. Sweet flavor."

"Exceptional brew.  Ruddy color with a fluffy tan head that lingers nicely.  Seems to keep the aroma opened up.  Swirled in snifter it conjures the sweet dark air of bananas foster.  Feels every bit the Abbey Ale moniker going down, but with a very complex blend of malt, spice, and root.  Stellar and a great looking bottle."

""
"Good beer. Good taste. Nice feel."
""
""
"Great abbey style ale..nice lacing ..poured into a snifter from bottle..wonderful yeasty abbey ale aroma..8.5 % abv but the alcohol is not overwhelming..very well balanced has a yeasty bread taste found in traditional Belgian abbey ales.just a excellent well balanced beer. I am biased because abbey style ales are my favorite brews.. If you see it give it a try this is a world class beer IMHO"
""
""
""
"Working off old notes.  Will update with more details if/when I have another."
"Pours a dark red-brown with fluffy light brown head, settles in a minute to a thin ring, delicate rings of lace halfway down the glass. Smell: pear and prune, note of brown bread, earthy cumin, notes of plum skin and perfumey coriander. Taste: plum, unripe pear, pepper, note of dates, brown sugar, (surprisingly harmonious) black licorice and clove round it into a peach skin finish. Medium bodied with pillowy carbonation."
""
"Reddish brown in color, slightly cloudy, with a beautiful tan head.  Sweet malt aroma, with burnt sugar and faint dark fruits.  Complex taste with some caramel and fig sweetness, bitter orange peel marmalade, some clove and other spices, a mild hop balance and some slight pepper notes and warming alcohol.  Light, slightly syrupy mouthfeel with a peppery, alcohol twinge.  Very solid offering."
"Overall I thought this was a great beer. It had a great flavor, looked beautiful, had a nice aroma. The weekest aspect I thought was the mouthfeel. The beer could use a little more carbonation."
""
""
""
"O: This is the first abbey-style beer I've had. I've never had a Trappist beer yet as well, but if this is just a glimpse into what the style is, I like it."
""
""
""
"The original from the best Belgian brewery in the country."
"O - This might be my favorite of the Ommegang offerings. Very enjoyable and reasonably priced. Do yourself a favor and let this one warm up - don't drink it straight out of the fridge."
"The flavor is rich with prune and date, some crabapple, light fig and a touch of molasses. The finish is just a touch spicy with ginger and nutmeg."
""
"V - Medium value, got in large, corked bottle."
""
"Sticky sweet, molasses, dark fruit, brown sugar"
""
"Pours amber in color with a dark crimson hue and a foamy off white head that retains nicely. Aroma has notes of figs, dates, and some slight spice. Mild alcohol and an almost savory aroma near the end. Taste is more phenolic spice forward than the nose. Notes of fig plum and cherry follow before a big dry yeast and husky malt flavor finishes. Mouthfeel is medium bodied highly carbonated and very dry."
""
"O: Pit this against any Trappist or Belgian brewed dubbel in a blind tasting and it will hold its own just fine, if not take the crown. This is truly one of the world's best dubbels as I see it. Great pairing with rich triple creme cheeses, hearty dishes like beef burgundy, or even sticky desserts like fruitcake or bread pudding. This is a landmark beer for American-brewed Belgian ales, and it set the bar pretty high for everyone else."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Really delicious, I would love to drink this during Christmas Eve as it has a lot of great holiday feel to it."
""
"Outstanding beer, exactly what I've been looking for. Dark brown pour, strong at over 8% but masked by rich, malted fruit flavors. Very easy to drink, very enjoyable- definitely going back for more"
""
""
""
""
""
"This is one of my favorite beers of all time. Poured from a 12oz bottle into a tulip. L: deep hazy amber with a huge off-white head to tan. I have to pour very slowly to prevent it from overflowing my snifter glass. S: nice fruity smell, some yeast, lightly toasted bread, figs. T: very rich, complex flavor. Fruit and yeast flavors, caramel.  very little bitterness. F: full body, lots of carbonation. Alcohol not too strong. O: an amazing beer. And a less expensive way to enjoy a perfect example of a Belgian dubbel."
""
"Extremely delicious, tried it with Pizza maybe thats what threw me off a little. However a dark, well rounded beer, smells great and tastes good. Just a little heavy for me and a bit of a dull after taste. At 8.5%, the price is reasonable and being from the U.S. Its a must try!"
"Abbey Ale is fantastic in the safest way possible. It looks beautiful when it's poured, it's not offensive to any senses, and it tastes rich while maintaining a smooth finish. I love drinking this because it doesn't really have a weakness. It's just good."
""
""
""
""
""
"Big, frothy, foamy head. Wildly carbonated. Dark amber in color. Aroma of super sweet malts. Yeah, that's what it smells & tastes like. Add some caramel(?) & dried fruits, make it super smooth, warming, full bodied. Noticed a little spice but that seems to take a back seat after a few sips. Finishes dry, like it's supposed to. Alcohol strength doesn't show until later, and then it grabs you, so you grab another. Dang, this is good! Another great one by Ommegang."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O:  a great American version of the Belgian classic; loads of fruit with just enough of that real trappist monk yeast punch"
""
"O â€“ Ommegang is one of the best American producers of Belgian styles and this is no exception.  Straightforward, not flashy, but incredibly flavorful, complex at the same time.  A phenomenal beer, a dubbel that would make the monks proud."

"Real nice Belgian abbey...  Decant balance of sour, dark fruit, cherry, caramel and some spice... I don't love the style, so my review should be taken with a grain of salt. Never the less it is very well balanced and pretty easy to drink at 8.2 has enough malt to balance out the sourness. Great Dubbel~"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a bright copper color with a white head. The smell is sweet from the alcohol and the wheat. The taste was excellent with rich malt and bitter hop notes throughout. The finish was also exceptionally clean. I really enjoyed the balance of the sweet malt flavors such as banana and the bitter hops and spice make this a refreshing beer any time of year and one of my personal mainstays."

"	This is the first Dubbel I've reviewed and quite possibly the first one I'll have ever tried in my life... Certainly the first of it's style since I've become more interested in craft beers, and coincidently it's also the first beer that Ommegang officially brewed... I was going to get a foreign Dubbel, but I'm much more a fan of American sbeers (at the present time) so I chose the domestic route, and having seen PLENTY of good remarks about Ommegang's Farmhouse Ale, I figured that'd be a decent choice for a Dubbel...  Also, since their specialty is Belgian style brews, it seemed fitting that they be my brewery of choice in trying this Abbey Ale... It poured what seemed to be a medium bodied beer that had an extremely vigorous 3 inch rusty colored head with some pretty decent sized bubbles within it...  The head dissipated rather quickly though, leaving behind a touch of lacing and not very much of a cap, but the hazy red hue is a beautiful tone with quite a bit of opaqueness to it... The aroma present on the nose immediately is the almost raisiny malty sweetness, with a bit of molasses and spice, as well as a  touch of bread/wheat in there also... A very strong nose on this brew, not aromatically challenged in the slightest... The first taste is full of the dark berry sweetness of malts, while the spiciness of the beer gently tiptoes on your palate as well... After a few sips and letting the beer set a moment as I wrote this, the licorice became more pronounced with the passing of time... The finish is pretty crisp and somewhat drier than the rest of the beer's elements, this is also where you'll taste some faint bread elements, but the berry flavors are still the most prominent...  The mouthfeel has a medium fullness to it, with the effervescence giving it a creamy mouthfeel... Overall, pending this is a good representation of this style, the beer was crafted well,with a decent amount of complexity to it... I would have preferred a bit more spice in place of the fruitiness that's contained within this beer, but regardless what I would have done it's far from a one note song... That being said, I wasn't overly impressed with this beer, but that could simply be that this is mores not my favorite STYLE of beer, as the flavors all worked well with each other and were in good balance... Another good brew - Cheers!!"

"Overall: It's a decent enough Dubbel if you have that Belgian Abbey Ale craving, but it doesn't quite meet the mark when it comes to some of the more diverse flavors that are available on the market. I wouldn't say ""don't drink it"" because is is a lovely beer. It just feels like a beer that was hurried or something."

"I feel like this beer must be the benchmark for all american beer companies seeking to brew a traditional belgian dubbel. Everything about this beer is practically spot on from the beautiful honey brown color and robust head to the complex flavor and delicate mouthfeel. I would definitely buy this again."

""

"Overall, this is a bold and flavorful brew that isn't as decidedly sweet as most of its peers. Its balance and gorgeous presentation make it one of my preferred dubbels, even though it isn't an archetypal representation of the style."
"22 oz bottle and 12 oz bottles. Exceptional drinking experience. Would buy again in an instant."
""
"Mouthfeel: Creamy and fluffy."
""
""
""
"Poured into pint glass, cream head, dark red, slight brown.  Aroma of caramel, raisins, plums.  Taste is much the same but super flavorful.  Really tasty and enjoyable."
""
""
""
"It's this beer's fault that I really fell hard for craft beer. Before that, it was something fun to explore but now I am hooked on the heavy rich stuff- thanks, Ommegang!"

"I love this ale! And yes, I am a bit bias when it comes to the Abbey Ale line up. And no doubt, this a lead contender. And for me, I can fairly judge a beer/wine store by its selection of Abbey Ales. Without touting my love any further, this ale packs a delightful punch of pure malts. An instant salivation, especially when the froth saturates your ever hunger.  YUM!"
""
""
""
""
""

"Sweet malty aroma with lots of yeast. Brown color with creamy very foamy head. Has a bready, malty flavor with hints of licorice and caramel."
"Serving type: bottle"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"From bottle at home. Although I found this interesting, but it was not to my liking. Way too much going on. My first impression was a slight sourness, which unto itself was surprising. The label lists many flavors the only ones that came through were some licorice root...deep on the tongue...& some burgundy notes. Rereading the ingredients, I think I should use this in a daube de boeuf. I will say that the 8.2% ABV was undetectable. Points for effort but just not for me."

"Not a style I seek out to much, but this one was pretty enjoyable."

"[Edit] Had on draft at Pinch American Grill at Empire City Casino in Yonkers, NY. The aromas and tastes of dark fruits were definitely amplified. Mainly prunes and raisins, with some occasional tastes of caramel. Mouthfeel was seriously unbelievable. The smoothest, richest, creamiest beer I've ever had. F****** delicious! Appearance: 4.75     Smell: 4.5     Taste: 4.75     Mouthfeel: 5     Overall: 4.75"

"DATE REVIEWED: July 11, 2014... GLASSWARE: Chimay 125th Anniversary chalice... OCCASION: Cavs welcome the Return of the King... APPEARANCE: as the label suggests, dark burgundy body; thick, stable single-finger off-white head; limited lacing... AROMA: deep plum and floral hops; coriander and citrus heighten the aroma; lilac and honey hover late--delectable... PALATE: big, full-bodied and demanding of attention; creamy and enjoyable (almost like a warm milkshake) with every sip... TASTE: some iron and wine to start; soft plum and coriander; medium hops and solid malts form a balanced flavor profile; some berry accents late--complex and rewarding... OVERALL: first, the LBJ parallels: both are worth the money, both are well-built, comfortably strong (8.2% ABV), agile, and absurdly smooth, both are versatile when pairing with other food/players, and both are winners...I had almost forgotten how good this beer is..."

"O: A good beer, not as impressive to me as the Rare Vos (despite its higher ratings) but really flavorful and different. Solid A."
""
""
""
""
"Pours from the bottle a dark, dark brown with a substantial foamy off-white head. Good lacing. Aroma is of dark fruit and malt. Big taste of prunes, plums, spices and sweetness. Medium mouth that coats the tongue well, leaving a nice lingering taste. A wonderful example of the style, and one that I'll have to revisit often."

"My dad passed away a couple of years ago. He was a very enthusiastic fellow about many things, one of which was fruitcake (yeah, I know). In the fruitcake family, at least the way he made it, was pecan whiskey cake. Even people who hate fruitcake loved his pecan whiskey cake. This beer reminds me of that cake - dark, dried fruity, accompanied by the pleasant presence of alcohol, etc.. Whenever I drink this beer, I think of my dad and his enthusiasm for making unusual desserts."

"Dark brown in color with almost a trace of amber. A good half inch of tightly woven khaki colored head. Fairly cloudy in complexion. Brussels lacing. I get dark Belgian candy sugar, amber malt,and the distinct Belgian yeast in the aroma. The mouth is highly carbonated and dry. I get amber malt,dark Belgian candy sugar and Belgian yeast in the flavor profile. As the beer warms I get a bit of some nuttiness and spices almost like cinnamon. It seems out of place here."

"Notes from after the fact. I just plain didn't jive with this beer. The licorice ruined it for me. This beer came off as tasting like root vegetables with potato and turnip. The sweetness of the chocolate malt flavor and the twang of the licorice with vegetable notes just didn't go together. Licorice and anise spice lingered long after. There were other redeeming qualities like a great body and a nice porter-like woodiness that I appreciated, but I couldn't get past the bad parts. And I'm even a fan of licorice an anise, just not in my beer apparently."

"O-very nice beer. wish it was in 12oz'ers. I'd be fine with one of those, but I am a sucker for a corked bottle anyway. this is definitely ones of those beers that improves as it warms. the bottle even lets you know to serve it a 50 degrees. I'm not usually a fan of US takes on Belgians ales, but this is one of the best. a complex but very drinkable beer. just beware the 750mL can go down very easily and the 8.2% ABV can sneak up on you quickly."

"sort of a grape bomb, little cough syrupy. might be a HINT off, doesn't fail the beer though. is reminiscent of Belgians. same body, bite, yeast flavors. haven't had many ommegangs. had this at a local bar. hope to see some of their other stuff on tap too"

"Liquid bread, or liquid fruitcake. This is a good beer, and enjoyable, but very disappointing for me. It's not up to the standard I'm used to from Ommegang, and it's probably my least favorite Dubbel from a reputable brewer."
"O - This is the best beer I've had in quite some time. This is also one of the more expensive bottles I've purchased in a while, and I'm strongly considering trying to find a way to get some volume at a lower price. Highly recommend."

"Poured into goblet from bottle. deep brown color, with lighter off-white head. great retention , plenty of lacing. Some roasty and fruity scents. On taste, it feels full and rich in the mouth, withso many flavors that after 4 of these I still haven't identified them all. There's sweet malty flavors, as well as fruity and more chocolately ones. Everything is balanced and satisfying."

"Overall 4.5: It just doesn't get much better than this, folks. It's been quite some time since I've had a dubbel and this baby makes me want to go out and buy up every bottle of Ommegang I can find. This brew is smooth, balanced, refined...just delicious and absolutely no hint of the 8%+ ABV in the taste. Highly recommended. Wow."

"The lacing showed itself as we quaffed our beer with appetite and pleasure, however, the head had nary a chance to subside as we inhaled our ales with an avid fervor like the way one drinks before dinner on an empty stomach. What a fine delicious beer this is and with an 8-1/2 ABV, cheer and clamor filled our living room."

"Smells great, tons of raisins, sticky toffee pudding, brown sugar and a little molasses. Tastes like it smells, really fills out nicely. There's lots of that nice malt sweetness with dark fruit flavors. It does seem a little bit over carbonated for my tastes, but otherwise a fantastic dubbel! I was really in the mood for some dubbels, but didn't feel like shelling out for Rochefort 6. This isn't quite as good, but it still hits the spot and is a fantastic beer."

"From a 12oz bottle. Pours ruby brown with a huge, rocky head that eventually dissipates to a nice lacing. Aromas of plum, raisin and chocolate. Flavors of chocolate, brown sugar, and dried fruit. Finishes with clove, orange peel and chocolate. Wonderfully complex! Creamy but light mouthfeel. Deceptively high in alcohol. This drinks like a 6% ale, but is actually over 8% ABV. This is a delicious double."

"o: An excellent Abbey Dubbel, carbonation adding zing to the well-balanced malt and fruity yeast throughout. Tasty and easy-drinking. Will want to buy a bomber to age."
""
""
""
""
"O: a nice example of a dubbel. I found it a little less fruity than some of the Belgian dubbels, but a great drinkable beer nonetheless."
""
"I have to say I'm quite pleased with this beer, one of the few I've tried from Ommegang despite their year-round availability here in Albuquerque. This beer has convinced me that Ommegang is adept at making Belgian-style/Trappist-style beers and that I should visit more of their beers."
"Ommegang has done the style well with their Abbey Ale. It poured a dark ruby brown with a substantial head that remained throughout my tasting. The aroma was full of Belgian yeast notes, cherries, and dark fruits that emanated from my glass as I allowed the beer to warm. There is a lot going on in this one and many different flavors revealed themselves with each taste. Hints of cherries, chocolate, dark fruits and caramel along with a slight Belgian yeast flavor melded themselves with a smooth creamy mouthfeel to create a magnificent tasting experience."

"O-very easy drinking considering the abv, great representation of the style and delicous"

""

""
""
"Very drinkable and overall one if the best."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This is a very tasty beer, but it feels more like a Belgian Pale Ale/Dubbel hybrid than a true Dubbel. The carbonation, dark fruit, and malt complexity is lacking. While this style shouldn't be a real taste bomb, it still has a lighter, brighter character than is typical."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Such an ambitious head it's a bit hard to finish a pour. Smells of caramel and a little like my dog on a good day ... That's not necessarily a bad thing. I swear I taste bar-b-q in the background. I might not seek out this beer, but I certainly wouldn't refuse a glass."
""
""
""
""
""
"Deep brown/red color with a big, foamy head. Complex fruit aromas with a layered sweetness (honey, then caramel, then toffee) with a hint of licorice and chocolate. A big, rich, abbey-style ale that dries out nicely on the finish."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

""

"O: A very good example of a dubbel, fairly consistent with traditional Belgian styles. The high drinkability combined with the high alcohol is fairly amazing."

"O: Another Ommegang, another stellar beer. Abbey Ale is complex, super tasty and an excellent American interpretation of Belgian styles, exactly what you expect from this brewery."
""
"Definitely one the better (best) American dubbels out there, a little on the sweeter side but very good. I like bringing the 750ml to family events for sharing - affordable, available, authentic, drinkable - a good introduction for strong Belgians methinks."
""
""
""
"My favorite Ommegang creation. A really good and tasty example of a dubbel. Awesome!"
""
""

"This is not my favorite style, even among Belgians, but I was impressed at the execution. The flavor of the beer really shines through, with the aroma and mouthfeel not quite as good. This is a beer that is definitely worth having again."

"Poured into a chalice; deep amber-red (burgundy, as the bottle describes...) with a big gorgeous fluffy tan head that leaves a lot of lacing. Smell is sweet dark fruit, raisins, booze, dried fruit, sweet bread, and some attenuated belgian yeast aroma. Taste is spicy; big sweet malt, with dark fruits. Cherries and raisins abound, with spice notes from the brewing spices (which the bottle lists as coriander, cumin, licorice, star anise, and orange peel). Very carbonated, which contributes to a huge creamy mouthfeel that is just awesome. Overall I think the carbonation mutes the flavors a bit, and I prefer Three Philosophers to this, but it's a great beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I much prefer tripels to dubbels, but this is unquestionably good. Ommegang has a good record of producing some fine ales."

"Amazingly, this tasted less strong than it smelled and that was a testament to the strength of this beer. It's easy to kick back with a few of these at once, even though the alcohol would become apparent after a short while. The oily coating that this left behind on my mouth was so subtle and slick that I could have gotten hooked on that alone but there's a good reason why this has so many positive reviews on here - this was great from start to finish and worthy of its lofty rating on here. A must-try for any Belgian beer lover and those who doubt that an American-brewed offering can match up with overseas counterparts."

"The Abbey Ale pours a handsome dark copper and has a sweet malty nose with a pleasant bursting of citrus. Itâ€™s loosely carbonated and has 2 fingers head with excellent retention. Lots of foam hugging the glass, lingering sweetness on the palate. This beer has full body and a hint of chocolate. . Ommegang does this dubbel perfectly."
""
""
""
"12 ounce bottle into signature tulip glass, bottled on 10/10/2012. Pours very hazy and cloudy deep ruby red color with a nice 2-3 finger dense and fluffy khaki head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice foamy lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of big raisin, prune, apple, fig, molasses, banana, brown bread, clove, light pepper, floral, candi sugar, and yeast earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of malt and fruity/spicy yeast notes; with good strength. Taste of raisin, apple, prune, fig, molasses, toast, banana, candi sugar, clove, floral, light pepper, light chocolate, bread, and yeast earthiness. Lingering notes of light and dark fruits, molasses, toast, banana, candi sugar, light clove, floral, bread, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Fantastic balance and complexity of fruity/spicy yeast ester flavors; with moderate malt balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a creamy and fairly slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with hardly any warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a highly excellent Dubbel style. Great balance and complexity of fruity/spicy ester notes with malt balance; and very smooth to drink. A highly enjoyable offering."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Crispness nips the tongue all the way, carbonation is even, and there's a nice smoothness to make an all-around well-balanced mouthfeel."
""
""
""
"Overall - This is an excellent beer, deserving of its place on the Beers of Fame. I would recommend trying this beer as soon as you get the chance."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"If this is any indication of what a dubbel can be, I've ignored the style for too long. I've had a few within the style, but Ommegang Abbey Ale is a thing of beauty."
""
"O- Much of my original review stands, although I have expanded upon it a bit. The look has improved by a point, the bottle just made the nice head. Smell is bumped up, possibly a nod to the tulip glass."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - This is one of the best I've had. Such a complex beer, it makes me picture a brewer in the middle ages just tossing in anything he liked the taste of, with it happening to turn out wonderfully. Definitely will chase down more from Ommegang."

"A great great beer. Prefer it over its bigger Quad brother, Three Philosophers. I want to compare it slightly to Maudiate by Unibroue. Iâ€™d say the two are relatively close in quality, with Maudiate winning on more interesting flavors, the finish, and lack of alcohol taste."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O- Even though I've been drinking craft beers for years, this is my first brew from Ommegang. I've always heard good things about their beer and finally had the opportunity to give it a try. I wasn't blown out of my socks by this beer, but it was really delicious. I have a bottle of Three Philosophers that I'm saving for the near future."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Pretty good. The flavors are good, but I was expecting a little more complexity in the taste with all if the added spices."
""
""
"Overall, this is certainly one of the better dubbels on the market, and the delicate nature of the added spices brings lovely layers of complexity to what was already a very fine beer. The flavors arenâ€™t overwhelming, but nicely balanced and cleverly subtle, providing new nuances with every mouthful. One of the beerâ€™s only weak points is the massive level of carbonation; Iâ€™ve had champagnes with fewer bubbles than this, and the beer literally foams up in the mouth and fills the stomach with air. Had I a second bottle, I would let it sit open for a few minutes before taking my first sip. Other than that, youâ€™re not going to find much better Trappist-style ale anywhere."
""
""
""
"The relative ubiquity and value of Ommegang make it the rare beer that's both a good introduction to a style and one of the best representations of a style. This is a top-notch Abbey Dubbel, holding its own with Belgian offerings while being less expensive."
""

""

""
""
""
""

"Beer is medium-heavy in body, with medium-intensity carbonation that feels slightly aggressive and fizzy upon the palate. With time, though, this becomes comfortably foamy as the carbonation does its trick, softly moving across the palate. Closes rather dry, with moderate stickiness lingering across the palate."

"Pours a crystal clear ruby brown with a huge tightly bubbled beige head that persists forever. The aroma holds sweet malts of caramel and toffee with a huge expression of what a Belgian yeast strain can bring to a beer. Bubble gum, bready, Vegemite, with a hint of pepper round out the nose nicely. The flavor is sweet malts up front with brown sugar, toffee, and a hint of honey. Light dark fruits with all the yeastiness provides a great balance to the sweet malt. Medium body with a spirited level of carbonation and a sweet bubbly mouthfeel. This is a very nice brew, I'm glad I picked it up the other day."
"O: This is a solid brew. Dubbel's aren't my favorite style, but this is a drinker of a beer. I would return to this beer if I was in the dubbeldubble mood."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I am a huge fan of Ommegang, they have not made a beer that I hate. But out of their regular line of beers, this is perhaps my favorite. They have many others that taste better, but the Abbey blends flavor, drinkability and high alcohol together perfectly."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"overall - I was blown away by this beer. automatically without question on my top 5 now. couldn't believe I got this for a measly $2.29. and at 8.2%, I'm feeling great! Tastes like a $6 bottle beer to me! Time to go back and stock up on this gem."

"O-This is an impressive dubbel. Unlike some dubbels, which are full-on sugar bombs, this one dials down the sweetness and lets the other flavors (fruit and malt) do the talking. I found the flavors played nicely off of each other and the alcohol really integrated into the beer for a smooth drinking brew."

""
"O. It is a very good dubbel with sweet fruit and spices that are well balanced."
""
""
"A rich tapestry of deep, sweet, aged flavors. Although this quaff is an infant and fresh as the frigid Buffalo air - it is altogether familiar, as something that was always there. This is a fine Dubbel. Decadent. Sweet. But with a timeless underlying, rare, un-reproduceable, addictive flavor; kind of like how Sambuca Romana is so much more soulful and timeless than the knock-offs. It compares favorably to Gulden Draak, my favorite of all-time."
""
""
"Overall- very tasty beer but atypical with the roast. A dubbel that drinks like a quad. This sample was lightly oxidized i think."
""
""
"O - one of the best American made dubbels I've had and one I'll have again in the future. Ommegang's ability to craft Belgian style ales is unprecedented to The American craft beer enjoyer and time n time again deliver at a top shelf rate. This dubbel is no different and after having this I can see why it's a flagship for Belgian inspired American brews. A delightful and well crafted dubbel straight from Cooperstown, New York. Hats off"

"No sense equivocating, this beer is excellent! I find it a pleasure to enjoy such a fine brew, not too much of anything that disagrees with me, yet bold. Unashamedly bold! I see that this Ommegang Abbey Ale has been reviewed many times, and I hesitate to review one of our fine beverages that so many others have disected and nearly unanimously enjoyed, but this beer is special, a fine dubbel. The flavors have hints of so many real and imagined fine assets, banana, caramel, molasses, alcohol even citrus. It's all in there, waiting to be released and enjoyed. On any given day, this beer can deserve a 100 score, but that would be perfect, and until you try it I'll leave perfection at 98 and I would be happy to try again, and again, and again to find perfection, but Ommegang has found a close fly by to the magical elusive perfection."

"Overall- World-class, without a shadow of a doubt. Deliciously fruity without nearing pungency. A score for anyone who loves a good Belgian Ale. Just 30 minutes and it was gone, but I'm certain to be back!"
"Notes; every time I try this beer my opinion of it declines. It comes up short in so many ways. If you want to drink an American Dubbel drink Pere Jacques by Goose Island."
"Medium to full bodied with soft carbonation. Feels somewhat creamy. This beer is so well made, it is hard to criticize anything about it."

"a lovely american dubbel. it pours a rich cherrywood color with a two inch tan head that is fizzy and lasting. the nose is quite yeasty, spiced, and a little sugary like candy. there is a ton of fruit in the flavor, dried and a little sweet, but totally balanced by the yeast, the bubbles, and the alcohol. this is a really fun brew, elegant and sassy. finish is sweet but quick, the yeast lasts on the tongue for a bit. this has infinite culinary potential. mouthfeel is perhaps even a little overcarbonated, its so bubbly i cant always taste every bit of it. it doesnt settle down at all either. medium body and way dinkable for over 8% abv. like all ommegang beers, this is something special."

"Atmosphere is great. Frothy head and thick lacing. Nose is full, but a basic combination of bready malt and tea leaves. Flavor is again basic, but well done. Light malt with pungent sweetness of raisin with a stronger tone of honey. Light but full. Overall, this is a really good quaff."
""
"O: This was a very good Belgian double. It had plenty of sweetness and complexity with its fruit and licorice notes; and, the Belgian yeast funk is fairly restrained and remained closer to bread or biscuit with only a bit of funk. I might not go out of my way for this beer, but it was a very enjoyable beer anyway."

"I drank this a few years ago and was memorably not impressed. I guess I have gained an appreciation for Ommegang in general, for I now think this is pretty good. It's not as ""Belgian"" as some examples of this style, but sometimes this is a good thing. This is pretty clean and drinkable, although it is a bit boozy."

"Great pour , nice head , lacing is there. The smell is wonderful. Taste is outstanding the malt and spices really come through and blend together perfect and the feel is great , a dry finish just tops this beer off. This is one of my new favorites , served from a bottle"

""

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A great beer! Smell is malty, with hints of caramel, banana and nuts; a bit spicy too, typical of many Belgians. Tastes boozy yet smooth. I get dark fruits, but also orange, caramel, and spices. Carbonation mellows as the beer warms. Overall, a superb dubbel brewed in the Belgian tradition by an American brewer."
"Overall this is a good Belgian dubbel but by no means my favorite. Fairly dark fruit forward with emerging alcohol and a strong yeasty spice. I bet all these flavors would mellow out with age but there are also higher quality examples worthy of cellar space. Good, not great, worth a try to emerging fans of the style for availability and fair price point."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Looks nice. It's a bit heartier and spicier than I would have guessed. Carbonation seems a bit too much really. Fairly smooth overall, though I would have anticipated it being a bit more considering who made this and who they collaborated with. Interesting to see my perceptions of this beer now as compared to so many years ago."
""
""
""
""
"Smells a bit pine-y, sharp, and clean. First taste is fruity sweet and champagne-like, then hits your throat and stomach like a fine whiskey, leaving a wonderful glow. Malt, woody oak flavors linger, with a honey sweet aftertaste. This is one fine beer - most highly recommended."
""
"O - One of my all time favs. And for $8 at the local HEB? Sign me up!"

"Review from 2/2010 notes. Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Pours a nice dark orange color with a creamy tan head and nice lacing. Delicious aroma of caramel malts, dark fruit and Belgian spicing. Typical Belgian flavors, dark fruit, orange, spicy. High carbonation leaves a dry, slightly astringent flavor. Somewhat sour, dry fruit finish. A bit on the dry side for my taste in dubbles, but well made and pleasant to drink. Medium bodied."
""

"The mouthfeel is a little on the heavier side of the style with carbonation being high but delicate. Overall, it's a great version of the style. It comes together very well and is very flavorful. Great beer overall, a classic."

"Poured into a chalice. Pours deep caramel brown with a biege head. The head dissipates slowly, leaving no lace. A cap of head retains forever and leaves some on the side of the glass during consumption. The beer has the typical Belgian dubbel smell. It has the smell of dark candi sugar, Belgian yeast, malt, and dark fruits. The beer tastes like an authentic Belgian dubbel. There are the bready malts, dark candi sugar, dark fruits (prune and raisin), and Belgian yeast flavors that really come through without tasting too heavy. This is superb. The alcohol is well hidden in the taste as well. The body is full with adequate carbonation. The beer is smooth and dry in the finish. This is an excellent beer and the best American made dubbel I've ever tried."

"D- I tried it and enjoyed it. Basically a brown ale from Belgian with more sweetness rather than hops, with a kick of alcohol."

"O - rich, balances, deceptively easy drinking, an outstanding example of the style and a must for any beer advocate"
"Pours a murky dark brown with a foamy 2 inch khaki head that settles to a small cap on top of the beer. Foamy rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, brown sugar, caramel, toffee, dark fruit, and some spice aromas. Taste is slightly tart with toasted malt, caramel, toffee, and spice flavors with the dark fruits coming through more on the finish. There is a pretty high amount of spice bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer but I was not expecting the sour flavor and the high spice bitterness on the finish. However, this is still a solid beer."

"This is a complex, delicious beer. It's rich and full of character with a fantastic, malty flavor profile. This is definitely worth a try."
""
"O - Awesome appearence to this beer. Good wine characteristics. Nice/pleasent yeast spice. Great complexity to its flavor."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- complex, rich and sweet. At one point I was thinking of Dr. Pepper... Not a bad thing."
"Overall: this is one of my favorite dubbels. The malt profile is the right amount and it captures the Belgian yeast and spice character you think of for this genre."
""
""
""
""

"Poured into a tulip glass, on tap. This beer is wonderful. Pours a deep, dark burgundy color, very dense with visible particles throughout. The head is a dark khaki, about 2 fingers, and leaves delicate lacing. The nose of this beer is the highlight of this experience. It is full of red licorice, cherries, roasted malts, and toffee. I spent almost twenty full minutes just smelling the beer. The mouthful was very full with a dry aftertaste that really clears off the palate. The taste was again lots of black cherry, toffee, very fruity estery, and complex. Absolutely a beer to experience. Sad my local bar tapped out of it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Hits all the right spots and hits them hard, this is one rich, intense, yet approachable Dubbel that is huge on flavour in lieu of complexity. Worth going back for more."
""
""
"O: A very enjoyable sipping beer, not the easiest beer to drink. The alcohol is present, especially in the taste, and not as well hidden as I hoped or expected. There is a very nice complexity to the flavor."
""
""
"Overall: This is a very nice representation of the style. I enjoyed the blend of sweet and spice flavors. I would definitely have another."
""
"Overall: I was obsessed with this beer when I first turned 21. I fell out of love for a good bit. On retrying it, I can see what I loved. It's nicely balanced and the American spin with the dusting of hops really makes it shine. It's not the best, but damn if it's not tasty."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A really good American take on the Belgian Dubbel. Nice complex fruit flavors."

"It is medium bodied and modestly carbonated. Not a bad dubbel. It has lots of stuff going on in it that brings out different dimensions instead of just yeast and malt. I liked it but I think there are others in the style that I would take over this if given a choice. Worth a try for sure if you havent had it."

"Smooth flavor, full mouth. Not too biting. Certainly malty with a hint of cream in the head. A dark beer that definitely pairs well with roasted meats and some hearty starches."

"A job well done on Ommegang's part. I haven't really had to sit and think about a beer like this one in a while. Looking forward to my next one."
"All I can say is just try it for yourself. You won't be disappointed."
""
""
"O: A complex, lovely beer. I love the way it hits with that initial stroke of lightness, only to slowly let in a wave of darkness; it takes a special kind of brewer to achieve something like that. Quite simply, this dubbel is really one-of-a-kind."
""
""
""

"O: A bit rough around the edges at times, but definitely tasty."
""
"I can't believe this stuff is made in New York. If I hadn't known better, I'd almost swear it was Belgian. In my opinion, this beer is as good as 3 Philosophers (plus, it's cheaper). My only knock on it is that there's a fair amount of tartness in the flavor and I wish it was just a little bit sweeter."

"This really hit the spot today; after taking four midterms in less than 48 hours, kicking off spring break with a damn fine brew like this is just what I needed. Cheers."
"Beautiful color and great tan head; Smell of carmel malts and the belgian yeast - didn't get much of a clove smell; taste of toffee, carmel, and a little chocolate"
""
""
""
""
"O - Such a great Dubbel! Delivers time & time again."
"Smooth but bubbly mouthfeel and a crisp finish with lingering caramel sweetness and red fruit notes. Overall this is a very good brew. Much more fruitiness than I was expecting but it marries well with the caramel and malt notes. Never had a beer like this, but I'd definitely drink it again!"
""
""
""
"O: For the price point, this is essential Belgian-style cool-weather drinking made in the USA. Will certainly continue buying."
""
""
""
""
"O: A very good, very rich Belgian-style beer that's very smooth and drinkable despite the intensity of the flavors."
""
""
"O: I expected something a little sweeter, but this is still a good dubbel."
"With so many good beers we enjoyed that night, abbey Ale, the one that started it all, might be our hands-down favorite. Pouring a deep ruby, almost mahogany, this brew features a thin, off-white head and decent lacing. A powerful bouquet of dark fruit (figs, plums, and raisins) mixes with licorice and chocolate hints. All sorts of flavors erupt on the pallet, including Belgian candi sugar, fig, honey, licorice, and more dark fruits. This amazing beer is medium in body, with a somewhat medium-light level of carbonation. Simply amazing!"
""
"Overall: This is certainly a world class beer. I bought tis on a whim at my local bottle shop, and I must say I made quite the find, will buy again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall quite a flavorful and drinkable beer. Very reasonable pricing in NY state. Have always been an Ommegang fan and would recommend to anyone who hasnt tried it before."
""
""
""
"Pours a nice ruddy brown with a thick off-white head. It tastes exactly like it smells... like molasses with some dark fruit mixed in. I may have gotten a bad bottle, but in my opinion it's overpowering both in smell and taste. This is the first ""world class"" beer I've had that I don't want to finish. I might even need an adjunct lager to help rinse the rancid taste out of my mouth. I'm sure this is a quality ale brewed with top ingredients, but I would never consider buying this again and I don't recommend it to any of my friends."
""
""
""
""

"Ommegang Abbey Ale, 22oz bomber: This beer has a very dark, near black body, and be careful when pouring because is grows a massive head. Tulip glasses not recommended go for a goblet shape. The aroma is powerful and mirrors the taste. The Ommegang bowls you over with flavor of burnt sugar and oxidized wine. No subtle mix of complex flavors here. Overall I did not like the flavors of this Dubbel, and I would prefer a more subtle presentation. The Ommegang is worth a try to experience how intense a Dubbel can be, but I will not repeat as there are other offerings which provide a more subtle array of flavors to the palate."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"B+, nicely done overall but a bit too smooth and restrained for me!"
""
"Overall â€“ This is a very tasty and enjoyable brew. It has great Belgian style qualities and is one nice Dubble."
""
""
""
""
""
"The beer is crimson colored with an inch of lasting beige head. The aroma brings toffee, fruit, cherries, yeast, malt. The flavor offers a sweet, fruity, yeasty character with cherries atop a malty base. The beer is medium bodied and really smooth on the palate. Overall, a very good example of the style."
""
"Even with only a (upper) moderate level of alcohol this is closer to a sipper with all the complexity and the richness. I'll take my time and enjoy this. Among the best dubbel's I've had so far, and I'll be trying two St. B's in the next week."
""
""
""
""
""
"This beer was a top choice at a lake restaurant I visited one evening. The color of this beer was a beautiful dark gold color. The smell was just as appealing as the color with cream and sweet aromas and the taste is about the same as the smell. I would definitely recommend this beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was the insane creaminess, and the warming fruit qualities to the taste. The beer was also very yeasty, which helped to downplay the sugars, and make this a no-nonsense dubble, much in the same way as Chimay Red. This beer stays true to the style, hitting all the high points along the way."
""
""
""
""
"So, i have just got to say - wow. Impressive drink."
"O- I definitely appreciated this beer. It was the last of the Ommegang mixed pack that I tried and it definitely lived up to the rest. It was nice and smooth and a nice level of sweetness."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Very flavorful and easy to drink despite the slightly high alcohol content."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Rich, burgundy-wine aroma, the alcohol definitely there. Raspberry-red color (a little like a nice scotch) and medium-low head. Strong honey sweetness on the nose, alcohol rather smooth & muted. Burnt caramel, a bit of raspberry fruitiness, richness lingers on the tongue. Opens up a lot more with warming. Definitely a solid dubbel!"
"O- An excellent beer. Absolutely one worth trying, and I will defiantly recommend this beer to others."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, such a classy, well brewed craft. Love pairing this with meats, and love cooking with it as well. Strongly reccommend, great brew as majority of ommegang beers are. Reccommendation, if you ever try this at the brewery, take a sip, grab a piece of the licorice root and chew on it until the sugars release and take another sip, the flavor it brings out is incredible."
""
""
""
""
"Overall- a fine expample of a Belgium Abby Style, even though it is brewed in the heart of NY state. A very nice and approachable Belgiun beer, I will be seeking this out again and again."
""
""
"O: 4.5"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This is the final beer in the four pack of this brewery's gift pack I bought back in August while we were moving. A good beer to enjoy after the Patriots win tonight. Very scary that the alcohol is hidden very well. I love when a beer can do that."
"Nice - rich and smooth. The aroma is amazing, though the taste is less balanced. Too much alcohol and the flavours don't blend perfectly. Nonetheless, an impressive and tasty dubbel that is well worth seeking out."
""
""
""
"O: Really good offering overall! I could definitely go for a few of these. It has a very nice level of sweetness and tons of flavor. If you enjoy a fruity, sweet Belgian Ale, try it!"
""
"Overall I am very impressed with this beer. It is a little frightening how easy it is to drink even at greater than 8% ABV. Although the alcohol does provide a nice warmth to the beer. I also enjoyed how balanced the beer was in the way that it presented its malt profile."
"Bronzy/rubyish appearance with a thick head. Dark fruits, plums, raisins, in the aroma and taste. You can't taste the 8.5% -at all-. The dry finish is excellent. This beer is the beer that made me start looking at belgians more than I had been."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Drinkability: Subtle, smooth, and very tasty. It is solid stuff. I was not that impressed with a couple other Ommegang brews, but this is good stuff."
"O - One of my favorite beers ever, one that I will keep coming back to again and again. Flavor is out of this world good. On par with all the Belgian greats. Cellaring some 12oz bottles of this, will re-write review when enjoyed."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall impression: A highly drinkable complex Dubbel. A wonderfully complex beer that has all the classic elements of a Belgian Dubbel. Seek out."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured from a brown 25.4 oz. bottle. Has a pretty bronze color with a 1 inch head. Smell is dominated by fruits. Taste is very good, lots of dark fruits, alcohol is well hidden, yeast with, lots of flavor, scary how easy drinking this is. Feels full bodied in the mouth and overall is a top notch beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Drinkable, but I wouldn't drink more than one in a sitting. Filling, and that dark fruit/prune flavour is quite strong. Check it out if you like that kind of thing, but if you don't, be aware that it is prominent."
""
""
""
"O: Very nice Dubbel, a great representative of the style. I will buy this again. Thank God for Wegmans (PA Residents know what I am talking about. :) )"
""

""

"This is a very good belgian making brewery. I really enjoyed discovering this label after moving to New Jersey. I recommend all of their offerings."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Very rich dark amber color. One fingered tan head. Smells like ripe pears and light bit of banana. Taste is sweet and malty with a little chocolate and some ripe plums. There is a light bitter finish. Very smooth and drinkable. I think this is a very nice example of the style and would definitely buy again."
"An exceptional dubbel as authentic as you'll get them in Belgium - although far cheaper in the US! If aging the beer like I accidentally did makes it more creamy and smooth (rather than bitter) and allows it to better reveal the roasted notes, I recommend a shot. Far from my personal favorite of the style, but still pretty great."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall I liked this brew. I'm far from familiar with Belgian styles and I haven't had many Dubbles, and I must admit that they are not my favorite. This is however a very flavorful and complex brew that is clean and easy to drink. Recommended to any BA looking to get into darker Belgian ales. Cheers!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a two-finger cream head that fades very slowly leaving a good lace. Opaque deep brown color. Good carbonation and medium bodied. Malty nose and flavor is sweetish candy and slightly medicinal. Higher ABV is hidden. Caged and corked 750ml bottle from Madden Beverage Saco, Me."

"This Abbey is banging - certainly among my favorite beers around. (I also said that about Rare Vos - coincidence?)"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - I enjoyed the Pere Jacques a surprising amount and decided to revisit the Dubbel. I was once again somewhat disappointed by the style. It's still tasty, but never seems to be what I'm looking for out of a beer. Am I not drinking good dubbels or are they just not that good?"
""
"Highly recommended, just make sure to allow this beer to warm properly before enjoying."
""
""
""
"Not my personal choice of style, but a world class example thereof."
"Overall, an ""okay"" dubbel, but not my favorite in the style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The mouthfeel has a medium body but a feeling of tannins leaving it dryer."
"Overall, it's outstanding, but I would put it a notch below similar offerings from true Trappist breweries."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, great beer, hard to believe its so high in abv, but the malt and yeast notes keep it interesting."
"DRINKABILITY: This is definitely an easy-drinking, repeatable beer, though I wouldn't recommend more than two unless you have a designated driver. I'd buy it again, serve it to my friends, entertain with it -- anything to drink more. Complex and creamy, it's a fruity-malty hybrid and a nice exemplar of a Belgian dubbel."
""
""
""
""
"A big dark beige head made up of large bubbles falls quickly to a thin layer on top of a clear dark mahogany brown beer with red highlights. The smell is of dark fruit, spices and a bit of molasses. The taste is similar to the smell with the fruits and caramels coming through fairly strong with a lot of yeast character in there as well. Bitterness is relatively low while the mouthfeel is nice and crisp with a fine dry finish. Overall it's a good Dubbel, I'm glad I gave it a try."
""
""
""
"O - A very pleasant Dubbel. i really enjoyed it. Very refined and not trying to get crazy or aggressive. Very hard to tell that this is 8.5%. In fact i would have guessed it around 6. A testament to how refined this is."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Nice beer. Becoming a big fan of quads, so the dubbel style is a bit underwhelming, but this is still an enjoyable beer to imbibe. Good slow sipper to enjoy as it warms. Would recommend to someone wanting to sample a good representation of a domestic Belgian style brew."
""
""

"Overall: I have fallen in love with Ommegang Abbey Ale and honestly can only think of one other dubbel which might have a slight edge. Regardless Ommegang Abbey Ale is in a class o it's own...take it for what it is but don;t take it for granted."
""
""
""
""
"Overall this is gem that will always be a regular on my list of top beers and enjoyed time and time again."
""
""
"This is one of my go-to beers, the cherry flavor is what gets me every time, with the perfect balance of hops. The color is also one of my favorites. I have had this beer on tap a couple of times, but I think that it is best served poured from the bottle in a low baller glass."

"i prefer a slightly sturdier Ale feel, so would normally lean towards a straight ahead Dark Ale.... but this beer makes a fine autumn seasonal for me. this is what a harvest ale should be imho."
"O: no wonder it's so well-liked - a truly delicious beer"
"Definitely on the sweeter side but unlike most of the bigger maltier beers doesnt have that terrible sweet aftertaste that lingers for too long. Good beer."
"o: So much occurring within the aroma and taste. Alcohol is fairly present but it doesn't take away from the beer at all. Solid beer."
"O: This might be pretty close to an ideal somewhat sweet and yeasty Dubbel. Hard to go wrong with this unless you like life sour and bitter."
"o - very tasty. it is not overly complex, heavy, alcoholic, sweet or bitter. overall a well balanced dubbel! i like some dubbels better than this, but i do like this one more than a lot of others"
"O: One of the better Dubbels out there. Great all around."
"A nice beer with an enough of a slight complexity to be interesting. However, it feels just a smig on the thin side and lacks the omfah of other dubbels Iâ€™ve had it the past. I think that it would pair well with food though, offering enough of an alcohol presence and robust flavor profile to hold its own."
"Mouthfeel is medium. Smooth brew that goes down easily and keeps moderate carbonation. I like having this one from time to time...I really enjoy it in colder weather."
"O - my first time having this beer and I will be on the lookout for it again. I will have to enjoy this one with someone that has a better palate than I do to explain the complexities I'm tasting in this beer."
"I ate dinner with some family on Saturday night at The Elephant Walk in Brookline, and was surprised to see a decent draft lineup here. I started with an Abbey Ale. It was served in an Ommegang-branded stemmed tulip glass. Dark brown color with a slim white head on top. Aroma was rich with cherry, plum, and red licorice. Taste was also quite delicious. Ripe, dark fruit really stood out as potent flavors. It was also sweet at the end, like they used Belgian sugar to brew. Mouthfeel was a slight bit hot from the alcohol at the end of the sip. This is a surprisingly boozy beer. It's been a long time since I've had the Ommegang dubbel, and I almost forgot just how good it really is."
"D - An exceptional tasting beer. It has good drinkability, though the high alcohol and complex taste makes this a perfect sipper. Really impressed with this one."
"D: This is a real treat, one of the most well balanced beers relative to the style I've encountered. So much flavor going on yet not one characteristic tries to outshine another, letting the pallet experience multiple sensations on the taste buds as one swishes the fluid around."
"Overall (4.5): Great looking beer. Emulated the dubbel trappist style beautifully. The lacing was fantastic. Despite being an abby ale, and generally complex, Ommegang achieves an amazing drinkability while still keeping complex characteristics. A definite must purchase again."
"The beer has a very nice color: a deep dark brown with golden accents. The head is nice but a little bubbly. The smell is lacking. The beer is not particularly hoppy. Carbonation is a little flat. The beer is in it for the finish. Overall it is a good beer. Well worth the buy."
"Quite a nice dubbel!"
"This is a very well done dubbel from an American brewery. It's a little more carbonated than I would like, but it makes up for that in appearance and the perfect bready notes."
"Overall: Been wanting to try this since it came to Louisiana. Love it. Complex and creamy. A very fruity/malty hybrid that warms the soul. Ommegang does Belgian right."
"Good brew. I would almost believe it were European."
"Highly recommended!"
"I guess that's why the label proclaims ""True Belgian Dubbel"". An agreeable enough cross-Atlantic effort - the Belgian character, terroir, whatever, gives this some decent complexity, though not overly so. Drinkable, until the too-subtle spicing gives way to the burgeoning heat, but that takes a while, and this is indeed a generous bottle...that I paid for once, and seemingly will do so again."
"O: A bit of a let down. Expected a lot more form this beer, just seemed to be lacking and thought that the carbonation as a bit high."
"M: This beer is sweet and dry at the same time with the warmth of alcohol. It is nicely carbonated that will not go unnoticed."
"A good tasting beer, solid for the style. Convenient in the 12 oz for those weeknights."
"O: Great beer that very easy to find. Not something I would want to get every day, but a nice dubbel nonetheless. Definitely one of their better beers and worth the try."
"Appearance is a murky dark burnt orange color beneath a modest eggshell head. Nice dark fruit scents come through strongly upon opening the bottle. Dark fruit flavors continue through the taste (plum, raisin), along with caramel malt, and maybe a slight coffee taste as well. Carbonation seemed very high, more than I like, and the finish was quite dry. Almost like drinking a sparkling wine. Enjoyable but not quite at the level of some other Trappist brews."
"yet another great addition to the shelves here in Alberta, I'm pretty stoked I have several Ommegang left to try"
"It's a slightly hazy abbey ale, gorgeous red in color with a tannish white head that sits for a little bit then disappears. The flavor is all in the yeast. These suckers poop out the most delicious esters you will ever taste, and the soft pallet of malt and hops lends beautifully to this symphony of beer deliciousness. Light enough in body to kick a few back (and stumble to the bathroom from your barstool) but flavorful enough to make you want to order more."
"Try this one on tap somewher near you or me."
"O- Overall a pretty nice brew but can't quite compete with some of the more traditional Belgian Dubbels/Quads."
"O: Not my favorite but good for the style. Thankfully not super sweet, but it wasnâ€™t the most complex."
"Ommegang Abbey is a great beer for sure. But, I admit I don't quite understand all the ""A+"" grades."
"Thank you, Ommegang!"
"This is a good brew. It has plenty of flavor. But it could use a bit more maturing to really get the full potential out of it."
"As it warms, an intense dark fruit, plum skins and figs mostly. Loved it, great flavor."
"Another very nice beer in the Ommegang family."
"A nice cloudy brown with a lasting tan head on the pour. Aroma of sweet caramel malt, some dark fruit, raisins, plums, dates. Taste is sweet malt, raisins, dark plums, dates and light hops. A nice medium body, good carbonation and a nice smooth mouth feel on the palate. Finish is sweet malt some yeast, dark fruit plums, a light toffee, raisins and dates with some light hops for balance. Overall a very nice, tasty and flavorful brew."
"pours a hazy ruby color with not much lacing. The smell is of caramel malt. I notice slight taste of cherries along with the caramel malt and yeast. Unique mouthfeel, it was creamy and thin at the same time, hard to explain. This is a very good beer, worth trying."
"overall - I love it. Exceptional beer that I will definitely have again and reflect more on what it offers."
"O/D: It's a solid beer all the way through, but just gets rather boring at times, and the flavors become monotonous."
"I have found my new stand-by beer."
"O-A decent Dubbel, I personally felt as if clove and banana flavors work better within the style."
"Overall this is a superb beer, though a little stronger flavor and aroma would make it still better. I only wish it were readily available in 12oz bottles around here."
"O - A suprisingly great domestic dubbel from a brewery that makes solid belgain crafted ales."
"All in all, this is a very tasty beer. The appearance is fantastic and both the nose and taste are great. This beer could use a little more carbonation considering the thicker body, but it does not detract from this beer much."
"Prost!!!"
"O: The beer isnâ€™t that difficult to drink because the alcohol is well masked from the taste (provided you can get through the sweetness)."
"Poured from a 750 ml bottle into a pint glass. This Belgian Dubbel pored a nice dark amber brown color with a nice tan head. Head retention was average and it produced decent lacing. The aroma was full of sweet malt, caramel and prunes. The taste of this ale has a strong malt base, it is sweet, creamy, and has a raisiny and spicy notes. The beer was sweet from start to finish. Awesome beer, best American version of a Belgian Dubbel that I have tasted thus far."
"The beer pours a slightly hazy brown color with a large off-white head. The aroma is heavy on the toffee and caramel with a little bit of dark fruit mixed in. The beer smells about like a I expect a dubbel to smell. The flavor is more of the same. I get some dark fruit (mainly cherries and plums) as well some Belgian yeast and some brown, candy sugar notes. There is a little bit of alcohol noticeable but the beer is still easy to drink. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. A very nice American-made dubbel."
"This is a really good beer, and this demonstrates why I should be getting more into this style. Ever Belgian style dubbel I've had has been really good, but this may take the cake over all of them. I will definitely be checking out more in this style and I owe a lot of that to this beer."
"O- Very complex. A bit hot, but some aging would solve this. Worth a try."
"O: Overall I'm surprised I'm reviewing this because, it's so common around me I take it for granted. All of Ommegang's beers are solid. I'm fortunate to live so close to them."
"Drink- Overall a good dubbel. Nice, big fruits and yeast. Balanced and tasty. Would like another bottle."
"Overall: a solid dubbel. I would have this again."
"This beauty appears a deep reddish-brown color, perhaps mahogany (or the color of maple sap) under a creamy and fully committed head. A generously deep bouquet of toasted candied maple, brown sugar, and caramel cookies with notes of ginger and raisin fills the nose. Body is a full yet relatively smooth one. The malt-centric taste notes here are very much foretold by the aroma but do finish differently with a more herbal and earthy tone than the expected fully sweet one. With its ending carbonation, the finish is also slightly reminiscent to that of the caramel-noted cola finish in a soda."
"pours a cloudy brown very big head that settles out nicely light lace. pleasant fruity nose with a hint of alcohol. taste, so much going on its hard to find a place to start, dark fruits soaked in a alcohol base cloves black pepper dark sugar malty spicy sweet boozy something subtle and new with each sip. smooth light to medium body and carbonation holds well. buy it try it you will like it."
"M: Carbonation is a delight. Medium bodied with a dry finish."
"Pours a reddish mahogany color with a fizzy, pinkish-beige head that is thin despite a vigorous pour. The aroma has a wonderfully fragrant combination of wine grapes, candied plums, and dark brown sugar. The flavor is likewise rich and complex, with notes of leather, rum-soaked cherries, raisins, brown sugar, and some deep underlying earthiness. The fine, active carbonation creates a texture that is both prickly and creamy. Overall, this is a wonderful beer that features rich flavors without being syrupy or otherwise heavy."
"O: Not bad. I think dubbels just aren't my thing. They're not quite red wine but they seem to haunt the same neighborhood, and I have to be in the right mood for a red. I wouldn't try this again unless I had the right food to pair it with."
"O: This beer isnt my favorite from the guys at Ommegang. Its high notes are the texture, look and smell. Its low points come from the taste, which might be skewed by light exposure. I will find another one of these beers, and update if anything changes at a later date."
"This beer pours a nice brown color with a decent tan head. there is some lacing on the glass. the smell is sweet with fruity esters and a nice belgian spiceness is present as well, its really a perfect balance between the two. the flavor is very full and again there is a perfect harmonious balance between the the sweet dark fruit flavors and the spiceyness from the belgian yeast. the mouthfeel is medium to full for the style and overall this is the best dubbel I have ever had. ommegang knows their shit."
"D; pretty big dubbel, but very well-made. gorgeous looking beer follows with a delightful smell and taste."
"Overall, a really nice beer and excellent example of the style. I find dubbels are occasionally too sweet, and this one is not. Really enjoyable."
"This is a really good beer. It's pretty mild for a dubbel. Good ABV that's balanced very well with the fruitiness and creaminess. Glad I've got a couple more of these."
"O- Nice full mouthfeel with good carbonation, the alcohol is apparent, but this is not a boozy beer."
"O- This beer is super close to being world class, it falls just a notch short in a couple categories. Definitely recommended pickup though- it's worth drinking again. I enjoyed this one quite a bit. Cheers!"
"Overall Drinkability - Good beer. Session abbey for taste and price."
"D- 4 This is a fine ale, and I'm hardly surprised given the brewery. Ommegang always seems to be solid. This is a good one if you're a fan of the style for sure. It packs a great punch of aroma and flavor and isn't all that heavy. At its ABV it will get you where you need to be, so you won't need a whole lot! It's nice to have this brew readily available to fall back on occasion."
"Overall - A great beer. Has a nice medium body with some great flavor and aroma combinations. Would definitely recommend."
"O: A very complex Belgian Style Dubbel. Just the right flavors play throughout the whole beer. This is absolutely delicious and about as close as you can get to a Trappist Dubbel. Smiley face."
"Overall â€“ Ommegang rarely disappoints. The flavours were really well balanced and the alcohol was very well hidden. After each sip I kept wanting more and more. Definitely worth seeking out."
"Pours an orange tinted chestnut brown with a thin cap of off-white cream, gone quickly. Scent is a blend of brown sugar, plum, raisin with touches of citrus, mellon and banana - a lot going on here. Taste mimics scent, with all of those different notes going on, it was really hard to appreciate as it came off as unfocused. Body is fuller side of medium, creamy but with highly active carbonation, lingering burnt sugar and alcohol flavors on the tongue. A good beer, just a little too much going on and it never comes together like others in the style."
"In the top running for the American made Dubbel. Very complex fruit aromas and flavors. Excellent mouthfeel as well. A go to Dubbel for sure."
"overall: well brewed with prounounced elements throughout, delightful to enjoy, be wary of the yeast though."
"One of the better ""American Belgians"" I have had. A bit sweet for my taste but it still drinks very nicely."
"O- This is as close as you can get to the real thing. It looks, smells, tastes, and feels like a real Belgian dubbel. I enjoyed it quite a bit, and will be coming back to this one."
"O - Ommegang really outdoes themselves. For the price, it is quite satisfying. Tastes just a beautiful as it looks."
"Really great carbonation that just gets better as you get closer to the bottom of the bottle. This is a delicious version of a style that's never been my favorite."
"O: I could really take or leave this one. It's far from the best dubbel I've had, and it is (IMO) more sweet and one dimensional with the sweetness level."
"Normallly, I prefer sweeter beers, but I have to say, this...is...superb."
"A well matured yet light dubbel. Nice raisin flavours."
"D- drinkability is superb on this puppy. Rich and delicious."
"O: Very tasty, I've had Three Philosophers before, and this easily proves that Ommegang isn't a one beer brewery(not that I thought they were) definitely makes me want to move closer to Cooperstown to be able to get their brews at a slightly better price."
"O-My favorite beer from Ommegang. This one matches up with any of the great dubbels out there. The alcohol isn't perfectly hidden, I guess that's my biggest knock."
"Medium mouthfeel with a dry finish. Overall, very drinkable and very enjoyable."
"Pours a slightly hazy apple cider like brown color with hints of red tinge to the edges. There is a big off white almost khaki colored head. The head is frothy and just about four fingers in size. The head stays around at about one finger and leaves a little lace. The aroma is of belgian candy, very sweet and inviting with a slight earthiness at the very back end. Very strong aroma that you can smell as you come close to the glass. The taste follows suit, there is a sweet malt backbone with a very nice candy yeast flavor. There is also a slight dark fruit presence and a slight balance of earthy hops at the back end. The mouthfeel is very carbonated. Overall a very nice very good beer, nothing harsh to make you dislike it, just a smooth taste and an inviting aroma to make you want more."
"A good representation of the style. Solid beer, but didn't blow me away."
"Years back the only Dubbles available were from Belgium, and while many were great beers, freshness was always an issue. As I have stated before the USA is making world class beers in every style. We are currently living in a Golden Age of beer. Enjoy it while it lasts."
"Overall - What can I say? Maybe I have become a quadrupel snob with the likes of Westvleteren 12 and Rochefort, but I like a sense of sweetness and fruit in my beer. This just feels like a semi-good imitation beer. Really cannot tell the big difference between a Quadrupel and Dubbel."
"O - A very rich and fulfilling experience. I'm sad that this single has to be finished."
"Morey's Bottom Line: I'm no expert on Dubbels. I've only had a handful within the style, but this one grew on me as I drank it. It's easy to see why this beer receives the ratings that it does."
"Overall, a staple when i feel like something belgian style. bonus points for being available in four packs for very reasonable $."
"The aftertaste on this beer is incredible. I have never sampled a drink (beer or other) that has done so much along the way. The smells are intense, filled with those spices everyone talks about. Then the initial flavorsâ€¦ it just gets better and better. This beer is incredible! If you like beer, any kind of beerâ€¦ grab a bottle of this. Bottoms up people, this beer is good."
"Overall: An excellent dubbel, easily comparable to the best from Belgium"
"O: Overall, a very good dubbel and better than many Belgian attempts at the style. It balances the sweetness nicely with the bready characteristics and is highly attenuated so that it doesn't become sticky sweet."
"Overall I think this is a good starter for the style if you're looking into Dubbel. It's drinkable and after a few sips gives a nice warm in the stomach feeling too."
"O ~ Pretty good beer. May have had this one a bit too long, don't remember when I bought it. Eitherway, I enjoy Ommegang's beers and would never turn one down."
"Overall, a good representation of the style. Could lend itself to more of a hop character. The flavors open up more as the beer warms up a bit. Definitely a sipper for me, and more of a dessert beer than anything else."
"Poured a cloudy copper-brown with a small beige head that dissipates quickly. Dark sugars in the aroma, with dried fruits, and sweet malts. Similar taste, with brown sugar, molasses, raisins, peach, and a hint of clove and allspice. Alcohol comes through just a bit. Complex and flavorful, well-balanced, medium-bodied, and a pleasant drink."
"The only real downside is that there's no huge plus. It's good in all regards, and a great all around drink, but I can't say that it left me needing to get more. I know they did a great job on another Belgian brew, but it isn't up my tree. Perhaps too much sweetness for me."
"Overall: Again, not awful, but not what I would call a good example of a dubbel. Bears some similarity to Millennium ale from Dominion brewing co. out of virginia, which is intended as a barley wine if that helps for comparison. both would be best enjoyed in smaller quantities."
"Beer is light in body, heavily carbonated in the mouth. Beer is pretty dry, heavy in yeast character. There is a mild metallic flavor to this beer. It is good, gets better as it warms. I'd have it again if there were few options."
"Pours dark amber with a huge khaki head. Aroma is sweet juicy dark fruit, a touch of some roastiness that gives off some chocolate, spice, and a little orange. Flavor follows suit. A crisp, active mouthfeel. Overall, this one was my intro into American made Belgian styled beers and it was a great one. Great beer."
"I was struck first by the head, which was plentiful and sticky. The color is a light brown with tints of orange. I did not get an overwhelming taste of caramel, but I did find a faint taste of fruit. It was somewhat sweet, but not overwhelmingly so. The thing I was struck by most was the carbonation, which was noticeable and lasting. Overall, despite the alcohol content, I didn't feel as overwhelmed as I sometimes am with Say Dogfish Head 90 Minute IPA. This is a really nice beer and a great introduction to Ommegang Brewery."
"O: I'm not really a fan of this style, but I'm enjoying drinking this well enough. I won't want a second, although it's much better when I stop thinking and start drinking."
"Ommegang's self-titled is a rich, complex Abbey dubbel. As far as I am concerned, it outranks many of its Belgian counterparts. Highly recommended."
"Overall - This is a great beer. Tried a 12 oz bottle rather than picking up a larger 750ml bottle. I'll definitely be picking up a larger bottle to try really soon."
"A fantastic brew that has enough complexity to please the snobs but enough friendliness to open someone's world to Belgian style beer. And being domestic, it's got a nice price tag too."
"O: Although this is my first dubbel, I'll defintely be trying more if this is any indication of the true style. Delicious."
"O - I like it. About the only dubbel I would buy another four pack of. Best in Spring or Summer."
"P â€“ Pairs fantastic with chili rubbed pork, red-eye bbq sauce, pulled pork, and steak."
"O- This beer is a good rep of the style but I don't see why it always gets such high scores. A clean tasting beer that I would have a couple pints of but it is a once in a blue moon kind of beer for me. ABV is just about right for me to really enjoy this but...yep...an ok beer for me."
"O: Can't say enough good things about this-- it's fantastic. Mellow, yet full of interest. Worth seeking out."
"Deep crimson and amber flashes makes this brew quite refreshing in appearance. A biege head with great retention tops it off. Smell is fruity, spicy, sweet(Oh My!). Taste is fruity but has a noticeable boozy tinge that reminded me of nail polish remover. Though, I find, that is common with higher ABV ales(this example being 8.5%). Also some spices peaking through in the finish(i.e. cloves). Most of the flavor lingers on the back of the palate with a heavy feel and medium carbonation. A quality brew, but I wasn't overly impressed."
"Florence NJ"
"One of the best Belgians I've ever had. Very complex depth and variety of sweetness. Satisfying to the taste-buds the whole way down. I like it with anything"
"One of the best Belgians I've ever had. Very complex depth and variety of sweetness. Satisfying to the taste-buds the whole way down. I like it with a peppery/fruity cheese like Robusto or Piave."
"This brew poured out as a slightly muddy brown color with a tan colored head. The head sticks around but does really give us a whole lot of lacing. The aroma of the beer was yeasty and had some dark fruits in the mix. The taste of the beer seemed pretty close to a real Belgian Dubbel. This was one of my first Ommegangs I had ever tried and was surprised that they were based out of NY. The flavors are earthy and rich, some yeasty fruits in the aftertaste. The mouthfeel is medium and not overly carbonated."
"O: This is just fantastic all around."
"Overall: A very good beer and a relatively cheap one compared to the rest of their offerings. Recommend."
"ps the 8.5% abv is noticeable in the smell a bit, yet is well masked in the taste."
"D -- Very nice offering, worth a try for any Am-Belgian lover, and also worth a side by side to show the differences between this and an import."
"M - Certainly a drier ale, but that is to be expected for the higher ABV (8.5%). Not overly chewy and the carbonation is perfect."
"MF/O: Creamy feel to it despite the big carbonation prickle, easy drinker, a bit sweet. Overall, a refreshing beer if you are in the mood for some big time Belgian yeast"
"Poured from a 12oz bottle to a Duvel tulip glass. Pours a dark reddish brown, dark plum color with a monster white head that sits atop the beer enticing you to drink it. Smells of sweet dark fruits, dates, figs, lite chocolates, grapes, plum, apples. Strong pungent belgian yeast presence, as would be expected with a fine Dubbel. A taste similar to a dark red wine, very sweet and dry, extremely complex. Rich fruits, tart sugars, a hop bitterness on the end, thick heavy spice presence to boot. Very dry and sugary on the tongue, a nice sweetness that opens up all the taste buds. This is a fantastic world class beer. Cheers."
"O: This has one of the best heads Iâ€™ve ever seen on a beer. I normally donâ€™t really appreciate sweet fruit flavors in my beer but this is fairly minimal and balanced."
"Pours a nice looking crimson tinged brown. Big lucious head that sticks around for awhile. Smells fruity and sweet with a little bit of earthy must. Palate is full of fruity esters giving notes of plums and bananas. Sweet and toasty malts and a kiss of earthy hops round out the brew. Medium bodied with a mildly dry mouthfeel. Very flavorful and a fine example of the style."
"O - Overall a solid brew. Not quite as complex as I would have expected from the rave reviews of this beer (I would have hoped for more estery fruitiness to offset and mingle with the spice) but a quality representation of the style, nonetheless. Would have again."
"This is a very good Dubbel, the equal of some Belgian dubbels."
"MF- Moderate to full creamy body. The flavors linger for quite a while on your palate."
"O: Lives up to its reputation. One of the best beers I've had to date. Very drinkable for an 8.50%. Cheers!"
"Overall a very good example of the dubbel style and truly the best I've ever had from an American brewery. I find myself consistently impressed by Ommegang."
"Mouthfeel is exceptional and there is nothing objectionable here. The only reason I'm giving it a 4 overall instead of a 4.5 is that there are better examples of the style, but only imported from Belgium. Highly recommend this beer, although it is almost as expensive as the Belgian brethren."
"Very tasty Dubbel, one of the best North American versions I've had. Rich and robust. Good value too as I can get a 4-pack for the price of an imported 750ml and this is just as good. Had this a number of time in the past, just never reviewed, and is a top candidate anytime I'm craving a Belgian-style beer."
"At first sight it comes off as being a sipper, as it is a dubbel, but this beer is so refreshing and very easy to drink. The flavors dance on the tongue. Not too sticky, medium body. Very smooth and well balanced. This is a wonderful beer and I think that I will have many more of these."
"Had to love this - as a dubbel it rates right up there - super treacle-y goodness and a great carbonation level. Had it at dba in Williamsburg, chilled to perfection. Love the rich, brown color too. If anything at all, I would have said a bit light on mouthfeel - but this is probably just me as I like a bit more slickness than watery-ness - and this is probably smack on for the style."
"Four finger medium foam head of light brown. Lace is dense but very little cling. Color is a 29 on the SRM beer color chart. Smell is a wonderful complex venue of fragrances. There are scents of plum, honey, pepper, ginger, peach, cinnamon, toffee, roasted wheat, and malt. Flavor is just as complex as the smell, with tastes of honey, roasted coffee, toffee, plum, raisins, dark chocolate, green apple, black pepper, cinnamon, and a light taste of lime. Mouthfeel is very creamy, smooth and has a snappy crispness. Great beer overall, will buy this again and recommend it to my deep beer friends."
"Overall. I dig this beer. Not on the regular rotation for me, but next winter I'll start a fire and enjoy."
"I am a big fan of ommegang, and this style beers, but this wasnt my favorite dubbel"
"The reveal - Ommegang Abbey Ale. Great stuff, although I prefer their quad (Three Philosophers) a bit more."
"I am a huge Belgian ale fan so I think that biases my review here, but this this is a great beer. It has a very dark chestnut look, with a fruity smell and taste. The taste is dark and sweet, slightly slightly bitter, with a good finish that is just a tad alcoholic. I think this beer, if you like the dark Belgians, is a real winner and I would very much buy this again."
"All in all a textbook dubbel that is easy to obtain. I commend Ommegang for doing what they do."
"A well-crafted dubbel. Reddish-brown body topped by a thick tan head that has staying power. Nose full of malt and yeasty dark fruit character. Flavor is true to the aroma, with a bit sharpness from the alcohol teaming with the low-level hop bitterness to keep the malt in check. Finishes just a little on the sweet side, but overall a very flattering take on a classic dubbel."
"D - Highly, highly drinkable."
"Drinkability- I would drink this on occasion, it's not a bad thirst-quencher, especially for being a medium-bodied beer. Duppel's aren't my favorite, but it definitely was worth the experience. If you like belgian-style ales with relatively high abv, and rich fruity flavors, I recommend this beer."
"D-Maybe a little sweet for sustained drinkability."
"Poured a hazy brown with a large tan rocky head and had good lacing. The aroma was of sweet toasted malts, dried fruit, a leathery yeast and had a moderate alcohol scent. It tasted slightly sweet yet acidic in the beginning and finished about the same with a mild alcohol flavor. Mouthfeel was light to medium in body with the texture being quite creamy. Overall an assume brew and quite satisfying to drink."
"D= to the extent of the ABV%. Some extra belching that might be a detractor for session bloating. In fact I'm still bloating up, half an hour later! A lot more so than with a typical Belgian-Belgian Dubbel. Maybe a bit too carbonated?"
"The CPJ"
"D: Better than average but not my favorite."
"D - I had 2 glasses out of the 750ml bottle and I just couldn't finish it. This one just isn't for me. I will review this one again in the future to see if my tastes change."
"Mouthfeel was great, it was so well carbonated I could feel each bubble burst on my tongue. And each sip left me wanting more and more and more."
"Great job, Ommegang"
"I don't know what went wrong with me and this beer for me. Just didn't pique my taste buds as a great Dubbel."
"Drinkability: Very delicious. Relies more on malt than yeast character, but it's hard to argue with results, this tastes good."
"D- Quite nice. Easy to drink...lingering flavors are pleasant. Nice to have this on our side of the pond. A top contender in this style."
"A must try from ommegang. I will be aging a couple bottles aswell."
"Overall: A good Dubbel, but certainly not one of the best in the world. Worth a try, though and well worth the money."
"Very nice beer..beautiful dark amber color. Came in a four pack and loved every sip. Nice mouthfeel with slight cling but fresh and trailing sweetness. Taste was sweet but had a balanced rough almost coffee like note. Very printable even though you can really feel the moderately high ABV. Highly recommended!"
"This is tasting pretty smooth, no doubt helped by cellaring. The alcohol is quickly warming, more than I'd expect from a 8.5% ABV. In sum, I'd say it is a bit more dry roasty than many dubbles, not too sweet, not as highly spiced, and pretty drinkable."
"Bottle. Poured into a DFH tulip glass a clear, dark reddish brown color with a very lively and think light tan head that is slow to settles. As it the head settles it leaves a nice sticky lace on the glass. The aroma is on the rather light side with notes of dark fruit and very slight booze. Dark fruit, caramel, and a subtle spice all play in the flavor. Light/medium mouthfeel with a pretty lively level of carbonation. Overall, I lke this enough to drink again but it isn't anything I'd go running out to grab all that often. Ends with a lingering slight spiciness and mild bitterness."
"Overall, you can't really go wrong with this Dubbel. A bit complex but well executed but the sweetness is can be cloying after a while."
"Beautiful deep brown. Wonderful sweet smell that's hard to pin down. It's just awesome. Tasted slightly sweet with full flavor mix of perfectly combined malt and yeast, again very hard to describe accurately without going too far down any one road. Plum notes show up in the flavor, but don't linger too long. Very nice going down in full-flavored swallows. If you can find it, grab it."
"It had been a long time, and this one actually performed similarly to how I had remembered it, as a very good beer that has a bit of a distracting bitterness."
"D - Keep these coming."
"Opinion: Well, I am going to have to say that this is not the smoothest Dubbel I have ever tried, especially up-front. The dark malts are just too assertive for the first few sips to make it really stand out as a beer to seek out. As it is, it is pretty decent as I am half way through the bottle and I can think of just about any other Dubbel I would rather have than this one. I guess this would be an alright one to follow up an Imperial Stout or something that was more roasty, but as a first beer, it was a bit of a shocker to the system for too long in the session for my taste."
"D: I would get this again. I slight sipper (if you want it to be) but it can be consumed rather quickly."
"This is one of the best dubbles I have ever had."
"D- I would def go back to this beer again and again."
"D- I could easily drink this everyday. Can't get tired of this one. Made me feel really sad when it was all gone."
"I would most definitely go back for another and would suggest this one to quite a few beer fans."
"Very drinkable, and just a really great beer. I don't know much about Dubbels, or Belgian styles in general, but I know that this is a wonderfully enjoyable beer."
"This was a very good beer, there is lots of complex flavor and pretty easy to drink."
"Poured from a 750ml bottle into a heavy chalice glass. Pours a mostly clear, deep reddish mahogany body with a two-finger width, fizzy, tan head that dissipated quickly leaving some nice lacing that stuck around. Very nice vinous aroma. Berry honey, raisin, a light toffee bread malt, and some softly spiced yeast. The flavor is more malt based than the aroma, but still maintains a bit of a vinous quality. Starts with some toasted caramels and a bit of bubbly berry taste. Lots of raisins and some more toasty caramels come in during the middle while still maintaining a soft, bubbly carbonation. Some candy licorice, slightly tart dark fruits, yeast, and banana bread come in during the finish where it dries at a nice pace. Sweet aftertaste that lingers with a touch of chocolate, raisin, toasty caramel, vinous fruits, and a light spicing. Palate is full and creamy with a nice, soft carbonation throughout. Overall, a pretty solid dubbel. Just a tad too sweet, but enjoyable and even more satisfying at the backend of the 750ml bottle."
"Deep reddish-brown in color. Fruity aroma with a distinct malty undertone. Initial taste was sweet with lively carbonation, a medium body that was finished with a nicely rounded bitterness."
"Nice complexity, I enjoyed the noticeable roasty components of this well-made dubbel."
"Brownish with amber red color in chalice style glass. Thick off white head. Smells of apple, toast, fig, and yeast. Taste is much of the same with fruity sweetness, apple cider, fig and bread toast flavor. Also a little boozy sourness comes through on the back-end. Very good dubbel."
"Overall Impression: A solid beer on all fronts. Ommegang Abbey Ale possesses a rich, complex character. I would consider it a heavy beer, in light of its richness and 8.5% ABV, making it a wonderful brew to sip and savor."
"The beer is sweetier and earthier. It tastes dirtier (if that makes any sense). The body isn't quite there like it is with a fresher bottle. Some of the fruit flavors have mellowed out and it is a little off. I was expecting something different with a characteristic Belgian like this. We did, however, pair the beer with a lovely Havarti. (I can't believe how much I am starting to sound like Martha Stewart. She is totally invading my thoughts...might want to have that checked out.)"
"It's brewed with orange peel and various spices. You can easily taste the orange but it's not overpowering and is perfectly balanced with a hops taste."
"D: Very tasty. The only problem I have is the tell-tale hint of metal."
"d: this concoction is very drinkable. i think the higher carbonation level balances out a lot of the alcohol presence. a great beer."
"Poured a brownish color with a nice 1 finger head. This beer has a flavorful malt smell. The first sip was very smooth and stayed that way through the whole beer. Tasted of sweet malts and sugar. At 8.5% this tasted so smooth and easy to drink, one would have to be very careful if they are hanging out for the day like I was. A great beer to have a tap, and something I would have again if I saw it on tap. Not different enough however, to have on hand all the time."
"Pours a dark reddish-brown, has a big foamy head, high level of bubbly carbonation. A very pretty beer. Smells fruity, malty, has a hint of alcohol in the aroma. I did notice a cherry taste too, big malty sweetness and a bit of yeast. Medium-bodied mouthfeel, just right. At 8.5% abv, it's more of a sipping beer for me, but still delicious and I'd definitely want another. Overall this is a very enjoyable beer to have with a meal or especially a dessert, the taste goes well with fruit or chocolate. This was the first Dubbel I've tried, and I'm impressed."
"D/M: smooth drinking, great complexity, little carbonation tingle, overall wonderful"
"Notes - First Belgian stlye I've tried beside Blue moon. Saw on a mix and match rack at Wegmans and decided to try. Definatley a great beer."
"Drinkable? Dubbels are great beers but at 8.5% one is plenty if you expect to be able to taste it. This beer is worth a try though."
"d - A very nice dubbel strong on the cherries as it warms up. I found it very easy to drink and loved the taste. Would like to have again."
"D - Like many in the Belgian style, this beer is way too drinkable. I'd recommend it to any beer lover."
"D - A bit heavy and high in alcohol, but definitely on the affordable side for a beer of this caliber. I finished nearly the entire bottle by myself!"
"I didn't think I was going to like this after my first swig. I took a shower and let it warm up, then everything came together. I haven't had many dubbels but this one made a positive impression on me. I'll keep my eyes open for others. I wouldn't hesitate to pick up a bomber of this tomorrow if this weather holds, and they say it will."
"D-I would not want more than one of these"
"D- easy to finish and quite the bargain at $7.99/bottle. this is probably my go to beer for this style. ommegang is one of the best breweries on north american soil at making authentic tasting belgian beers."
"This is a classic American Dubbel. Fairly reminiscent of Chimay Red to me, from what I recall. At the price this goes for it is hard not to be satisfied, even if some of the Belgians trump it. This is not a difficult 750 ml to tackle solo. I almost bumped the flavor higher, but that's probably the territory for the Belgians to occupy. Still, very nice effort."
"D - A good sipping brew. IMHO, the best beer at this Brewfest."
"A very enjoyable beer. Enjoyable every sip."
"D: Extremely rich and inviting, complex, interesting, and delicious."
"Had in a 22oz. bottle. Admittedly Dubbles are normal not in my palate, so i cannot rank this one high. I found this to have too much winey taste and a bit two thick for drinking more than one. If you do like a deep, rich beer, you may like this one, give it a shot in a bottle."
"Flavor is very sweet for a dubbel style, taking away from the drinkability but bringing a more robust character. Deep fruits and sweet malts are on the forefront, with a nutty, drying finish. Carbonation is moderate and body is full and sweet."
"Overall, a great Belgian (style) taste for $5-6. Ommegang hasn't let me down yet...."
"The taste on the other hand was a big let down it was fruity but the alcohol bled through to much. Its not a bad beer but i would deffinatley not reccomend it the three philosiphers is way better."
"D: Low due to the sweetness, don't see myself wanting to pick this one back up at all."
" My hometown isn't terribly far from Cooperstown (maybe an hour), so I definitely feel a connection to this brew. Well done!"
"D - Easy to drink and quite enjoyable. Sits well."
"I edited this after having a Pannepot Reserva 2008 (as well as other dubbles since the original review). I tried my best to focus on style (going from an awesome quad to a dubbel), but the experience did open my eyes a bit. I do think I reviewed this a bit too high originally."
"I was nervous about this one because a lot of people told me it was awful, but I love Ommegang and had to give them the benefit of the doubt. I really want to slap myself for even being nervous. All of Ommegang's stuff is really great, and this one is no exception."
"D: A good beer, just with too strong an initial alcoholic hit to be moved into great..."
"Served from corked bottle into goblet at fridge temperature. Carbonation is suitably high. This pours with an excellent head that remains thick; the lacing is excellent. The flavor is of roasty malt without being very sweet or very malty. The hops are absolutely perfectly matched- the bitterness is just right and the hops never take center stage. No flavor seems to take center stage, actually, in the orchestrally harmonious beer- this is well done! This will definitely be a staple in my collection."
"Beer poured a coffee color. Cloudy with a tall stiff tan-colored head. Aroma was earthy with an alcohol profile sort of like a red wine. A subtle wet dog aroma in here as well. Taste was strange. Peat, wet leaves, fruity,with rich malts, umami on the mid-taste morphing into a funky, tangy aftertaste. Mouthfeel was medium carbonation. Medium texture and body. Sharper rather than syrupy. Overall a unique brew. It is hard to pin down into a familiar style."
"750 ml bottle. Pours mahogany with a thick, off-white, long lasting head. Aroma is Belgium yeast, brown sugar and fruity notes. Medium, sweet, somewhat tangy body. Belgium yeast, cherry fruit and brown sugar fills the mouth. Long, bitter-sweet finish. Wonderful dubbel."
"I would like to see this beer be a little less hot. Given that it is bottle conditioned, I would suggest leaving a bottle or two for just two months of aging."
"a great american version of a belgian beer. pour is belgian carbonated. with some cloudiness to a redish brown body. nose is belgian sugar cane and candied citrus and spice. palate is that with a hit of beet sugar sweetness and pollen as well that is dissipated on the palate by the carbonation at first. then the sweet citrusy quality comes out a bit more when the carbonation subsides. a tad toasty mnalt, brown sugar, gala apple sour... very mild. bright and not particularly earthy. lean in body as a conbination of astringent acidic citrus and sweet."
"I poured into a snifter of two inches of tan head. This beer is murky brown in color. The aroma is brown/caramelized sugar with some plum/fig. The taste is some dark fruit up front and finishes with some roasted caramel malt which lingers on my tongue. It has plenty of carbonation. I really enjoy the toasted malt in the aftertaste. It keeps me wanting to take another sip."
"This one has a perfect fruity, rich taste and is just stunning in the glass - perfect light brown head. My compliments to the brewers. I have no interest in ever going to Cooperstown for the Baseballl Hall of Fame (we have the Football one nearby and it is just ok, music ones are good though, check out our Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in a beautiful June day) but I just may go up to upstate NY to make an Ommegang pilgrimage."
"This is a very good example of the Belgian dubbel style, but a little high in the alcohol content. I think this beer would be better if it were in the 7% abv range instead of 8.5."
"(12oz. bottle) Awesome fluffy cream-colored head pour. At least a 1/4 of head last throughout entirety of drink, very impressive. Equally awesome lacing on glass, very even. Dark Plumbish color. Small basic malty hint in aroma. Big hint of banana and candied smells. Very smooth blend of smells. Slightly fruity, also picking up hint of orange peel in aroma, brings a refreshing element to the aroma. Mild to moderate carbonation. Extremely dark fruity presence. Big middle and finish showing of alcohol. Little hint of breadiness in finish. Feel like I'm picking up some banana and some extremely faint hint of spice in flavor, but could be my nose tricking my tongue. Finishes relatively light and clean for style, not near as heavy finish presence of alcohol as similars. Very nice, warming and flavorful."
"D: Easy drinker with great taste, the alcohol really isn't obtrusive and does not make the beer difficult to drink."
"Mouthfeel was highly carbonated, with a rich, warm, full body. This was an outstanding beer; a pleasure to drink."
"Drinkability: A great dubbel. While it's not as good as some others (Chimay comes readily to mind), it's certainly a serious contender and would give an true Belgian dubbel a run for its money. Definitely worth a shot and definitely something I'll have again."
"D: A very drinkable beer, and less than I'm accustomed to paying for Belgian style beers ($6.99 for the bottle at Trader Joe's). Often I go for tripels or quads, but this is a nice change: a bit lighter and less fruity. A very good beer."
"Notes: A great beer. Too drinkable at 8.5 ABV."
"Notes - An instant classic. Traditional and bold at the same time. Pairs really well with food, as well. I try to keep a few of these guys around at all times."
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle. Dark brown, almost reddish with a nice head that stays. Aroma is predominantly fruity. Mouthfeel is exceptional, every sip reveals something different. Licorice, fruity, caramely, a slight taste of raisins perhaps...keeps the taste buds guessing and wanting more. Excellent finish, silky smooth, drinkability is excellent. The ABV is 8.5 but well hidden under layers of flavor. A beautiful dubbel, highly recommended."
"Alcohol is a bit towards the foreground, but is well balanced against the rich fruit flavors. At 8.5% this is probably a solo flight."
"Verdict: Decent enough and well-priced. Drink it if you see it but not worth seeking out."
"The body has a good thickness without seeming too heavy. The carbonation is perfectly crisp yet non-obtrusive. The dry dry finish yields superbly easy drinking. Great beer."
"Great American brewed Belgian style beer!"
"Overall: Nothing special. Kind of disappointed considering to the average BA score. Maybe a 750 mL is a better format?"
"D - A complex beer flavor wise and even mouthfeel-wise, but the flavors are well balanced and the beer stays fairly drinkable for its 8.50% APV."
"D - Easy and enjoyable to drink, but not something I would want to session. One in a evening would be plenty."
"very dark amber color with a large off-white head that remains thick throughout. Lacing is particularly strong. Very strongly carbonated. The smell is very weak. Smells like pennies with a malty undertone. taste is also metallic with some dark fruit and dark, but not roasted malt. mouthfeel is on the thicker side and creamy from the thick head. It's drinkable, but unremarkable. For a dubbel, I guess it's OK, but I was expecting more. Seems like a ""safe"" beer."
"D - This fits the dubbel style quite nicely. I don't think it's perhaps the best example I've had, but it is pretty tasty and quaffable."
"Well made and drinkable although a bit of the higher alcohol comes through in nose and flavor profile."
"750ml bottle: This one pours a caramel/amber color. There was a good bit of a fluffy tan head on it that doesn't completely go away. It has a very nice nose. Dark fruits and caramel/toffee are up front. Some yeastiness and breadiness in there too. The taste is quite good. There is almost no sweetness, in fact it finishes a bit dry. Toffee notes, some of the dark fruits and some chocolate. A nice beverage!"
"Another second chance at another Ommegang favorite. It pours a hazy auburn topped by a half-finger of slightly off-white foam. The nose comprises rye bread, figs, raisins, red grapes, cloves, cinnamon, nutmeg, and prunes. The taste follows very closely, with the addition of sourdough, pepper, banana, and a scraping of tangerine. The body is a hefty medium, with a moderate carbonation and a fizzily thick feel. Overall, a very nice dubbel, one that I'll be sure to keep revisiting in the future. It's a bit on the fizzy side, but it doesn't overdo this flaw and makes up fer it with a great taste and a hefty body."
"A very drinkable beer, that is true to the style. About time an american brwery got the Belgian style right."
"This classic Belgian pours a rich dark mahogony and has a creamy tan 2 finger head. It's aroma is filled with dark fruits - figs and raisins. The taste is terrific with dark fruits and caramel malt - very impressive. This is a medium to full bodied, very drinkable beer with a creamy mouthfeel and little carbonation. Give it a try."
"There are so many different dishes that would be great with Ommegang Abbey. Duck stew with mashed potatoes is a perfect match. Game meats, roast suckling pig, lamb chops, venison sausage, and almost any dessert (especially those with chocolate) would all be excellent pairings too. As for cheese, try it with something nutty such as Brie de Meaux, Hoch Ybrig, or Piave Vecchio. Enjoy!"
" D- The dry well blended rich toffee flavor has some yeasty cidery notes that are just a bit drab. Perhaps with some age more flavors will develop."
"Pours a moderately dark brown with some reddish hues. Off white head and some good lacing. Nose brings forward raisins, molasses, caramel, brown sugar, and dark fruits. The taste doesn't quite meld everything together, with some sugars and dark fruits coming through in the end. Moderate, creamy mouthfeel with lowish carbonation. Drinks pretty well, but not my favorite from them."
"D-definitely not for sessioning, however this is an excellent way to wrap up an evening..."
"D- Um, not exactly a session beer. It's actually pretty drinkable for what it is though, since it doesn't have one flavor that overpowers."
"Overall: Very solid beer overall. Great representation of the style. Definitely worth giving a shot."
"This beer pours a clear, dark, copper color with a bit of ruby red showing through in the light. It's got a very thin head that leaves tan lacing till the end. Abbey Ale's aroma has hints of raisins, vanilla, and dark roasted malt in it. The flavor has notes of toast, grapes, sour cherries, and maybe some molasses. It's got a medium full mouthfeel. Ommegang Abbey Ale is smooth and creamy but is also filling. This beer was a great match for chunks of smoked swiss cheese. Highly recommended!!"
"D - High. Nothing wrong with this. Delicious."
"D: Since I don't enjoy the finish of this beer, I don't find it to be very drinkable."
"It is definitely drinkable, but only for one or two. After that I could not taste it or anything else."
"Lots of fruity, malty notes in this dark brown, delicious dubbel. It's definitely one of the best bargains and most accessible Belgians around here. It doesn't pack as much of a punch as their quad, but it exemplifies the style very well."
"And it's amazing Trader Joe's has this for a measley $8 or so."
"Drinkabilty - The 22 0z would be perfect for one person. Any more then that and you would spoil yourself and miss out on the flavors cause you would expect it. Fantasic, cant wait to get more!"
"M: Not nearly as dry as expected, but I'm not complaining at all. Has some good body to it before the medium-dry finish."
"D- This has a little more than year on it in my cellar and it's much smoother than when I cracked a ""fresh"" one from the store. It's very nice for the style!"
"D-eh the tastes sorta bland together. alcohol note becomes stronger"
"D= I can see why this beer is so highly rated. A typical Dubbel that is made in America. I've had more flavorful Dubbels no doubt but for an American Dubbel this is on target. Dry and a little more rugged and this would be the real deal."
"Cheers..."
"Pours a bright ruby brown colour with thick off-white head. As the head dissipates, it leaves a nice layer of head on top of the beer with some lacing on the glass. Smells of cherry, raisin and nuts with the sweet malt. The flavour is really nicely balanced and the Belgian yeast comes through. Carbonation is quite high. A very nice dubbel."
"Overall impression: malty and sweet, this is unique for the style. it's not my favorite but very drinkable."
"D: Quite nicely drinkable for this ABV, though perhaps a tad too sweet."
"Reddish mahogany in color with a thick frosty, beihe head with staying power. Lots of thick, sticky lacings. Thick and syrupy feel, but with lively carbonation. Sweet malty aroma with hints of dark fruit, spice and a slight hint of alcohol. Malty sweet with spice in the beginning with dark fruity flavors and a touch of alcohol at the end. Thoroughly enjoyed this. Ommegnag never disappoints."
"D- This is a very good beer that is traditional enough to fit the style well, but different enough to be unique. I enjoyed it, but it certainly is a beer that one can feel 8.5% out of."
"Notes: Overall a decent beer, pretty big flavors with a good amount of spice, burnt and rum flavors that make it a bit strong. Not my favorite for the style, but not a bad beer overall."
"Need to have this one with a steak. Can't have many with high ABV."
"A pretty solid brew from Ommegang, though I prefer the Three Philosophers. I like the flavors better in that one, as I prefer the cherries to the prunes and figs. Well put together just the same, though."
"Verdict: Great brew."
"Notes: The 2nd of my Ommegang 8 pack sample, I liked it better than the pale ale. So far the appearance of the brews has been 2nd to none."
"Served from a 750ml bottle into wine glass. Sorry, but I was at the in-laws and no chalice was available. Nice head that remained a while. I purchased this beer after doing a fair amount of research. I read of very favorable comparisons to Trappist offerings. I have to say that this is a very good product. It is complex but a little sweet for my tastes. The closest Trappist I can associate it with is Koeningshoeven or Westmalle. This restores my faith in American brewing. You will be pleased."
"Enjoy the Abbey Ale on its own, or with so many varieties of food. Try soft and melty cheeses, tomato based pastas, meat pastas like lasagna, grilled red meat, roast turkey or chicken, Mexican or Indian foods, anything with chocolate in it, strawberry cheesecake, and on, and on.."
"drinkability is easy on this one... can barely notice the 8.5%abv..."
"D: The more I drank it, the more it grew on me. This is the first Dubbel I have had, as I normally stick with Trippels, but this could change that. Only thing that hurts the drinkability is the high ABV, without it I could drink this beer for a long time."
"Drinkability: If it weren't 8.5% ABV, I would drink this beer all night."
"Expertly blended, none of the flavors go too far nor are the fruity sugars remotely cloying. Everything rounds off beautifully in each sip. It's to be savored, if you have the patience. Little bit of warmth in the finish makes this a smart choice as an after-dinner/dessert drink."
"4-4.25 didn't blow me away, but a good dubbel for sure."
"Poured from a bottle into my snifter. Darker brown with some ruby highlights, tan head that sticks around and laces well. Smell is definitely fruity and grapy and is noticeable as soon as the bottle was opened. Taste is very much more grapy with the other fruits taking more of a back seat. Feel is nice and carbonated well, with some crispness. Overall a great beverage that I will be having again."
"D: Overall, this is a very good beer. I could drink a couple of these and be more than happy, maybe even too happy given the percent alcohol in this beer. I recommend it. Also this was my first beer to write a review for, the first of many I hope."
"Drinkability: This is the best Dubbel I have, with a strong complex aroma and taste. However, I have never found this to be the easiest to drink style; even Quads are more drinkable for me."
"D: High! Alcohol is present, but not obviously so. This scrumptious Belgianesque brew comes highly recommended, although for what it's worth, I prefer the 750mL bottle."
"Pours a beautiful solid brown, with a tan micro-bubbled head that washes the glass like a wave on every drink. Smell is coffee and almond, rather sweet, but with some astringency. Tastes richer and more toasted than the smell, with loads of flavor and complexity while the feel morphs into carbonated spiciness. Aftertaste is bitter, spiky, and active. Almost no alcohol burn to note, remarkable for an 8.5% brew. Definitely a filling beer as well, the 750ml bottle is plenty for me at one sitting. IMO, a beer that looks better than it tastes."
"All in all, a very good beer. Goes down smooth, and complex enough to keep you guessing and mindful of each sip."
"D: I can't drink a lot of these...to expensive and filling, but this is a great treat!!!!"
"One of the finest dubbels produced on this side of the Atlantic. I'll definitely be back for more of this. Well done Ommegang!"
"D- I am already looking for a place that carries this near me. Absolutely awesome. I would drink this all the time. Incredibly well balanced with a nice malty sweetness that is not overdone."
"Ommegang, I'm trying to give myself a little more of an education on the Belgian styles. This was a nice dip of the toe. Perfect for a humid summer evening. Nice, cool and crisp with a fruity taste, a touch of sour, nicely designed on the pallet. I'd recommend it - certainly a nice change in variety. Poured with a thick head, a nice copper color; this beer has plenty to deliver, and leaves a nice rosiness on the cheeks."
"Ommegang makes solid brews, and this is no exception."
"Mouthfeel is light, well carbonated, creamy, and is overall very drinkable. And very good."
"D - One bottle of this size is perfect. I would imagine this would work well with a big dinner, with the first glass during, and the second after as a ""dessert"". Will definitely try it again and would recommend it."
"Drinkability: An ideal session beer to an enthusiast with no prior obligations for the evening."
"Drinkability: Good example of a classic style. Flavorful and lively. I will definitely revisit this one again."
"pours a dark, very deep amber with a solid finger of fluffy tan head that leaves nice lacing. in the nose i get dark fruits, the malt and yeast typical of a dubbel, some spice, and alcohol. taste is more of the same: had to let it warm for a few minutes before the flavors really started to emerge. sweet finish. booze is there, but relatively well hidden... mouthfeel is okay, more carbonation than i remember the last time i had this (in the 750ml bottle) - a little too much imo. nonetheless, high marks for drinkability."
"Ommegang Abbey Ale pours a hazy deep red brown with a beautiful fluffy head that lingers nicely. The aroma is fruity, tropical citrus and pine with some nice raisiny dark fruit. The flavor is sweet and malty upfront with tons of rich dark fruit. There is a hint of chocolate and a nice dry, slightly phenolic finish. Not a hint of alcohol, exceptional for it's strength."
"D- I was expecting it to be a bit more drinkable, not sure I could sit through many of these in a row, but one was just fine."
"The drinkability is good. Great smell and complexity of flavor. Great Belgian from the US."
"D- 93/100- i will enjoy this beer when ever i have the opportunity... great quality... one of americas' best!"
"The alcohol of a dubbel should add a slight hint of warmth at most. This beer is nearly up to winter-warmer status. If you like a rich, complex, alcoholic doppelbock, I think you'll enjoy Ommegang Abbey Ale. I do. But I'd rather be drinking a good abbey dubbel!"
"Great beer, ideal for philosophical conversation."
"Drinkability: A good sipping beer, lighter and sweeter than what I remember from other Dubbels. Still, this is worth a shot, although it may not satisfy the biggest Belgian beer fans."
"Drinkability - What a treat! Beautifully dark, rich, complex, and delicious. A good beer for cold nights and good company. One 750 is plenty. Ommegang never disappoints."
"jd"
"A: Pencil thickness of head which drops quickly but retains a thin layer over the surface, color reminds me of ice tea, the beer is ever so slightly opaque - 3.75, S: The initial burst of aroma reminds me strongly of Tootsie roll and latte, there's a deep caramel and slight spiciness, I also catch some prunes and dates or some sort of dark pitted fruit, sweetness is present but quite muted - like a watered down maple syrup - 4.25, T: Spicy palate, a medium malt sweetness on the beer that finishes dry, I also pick up the faintest signs of earthy hops on the tail end of the beer, raisins, alcohol is apparent but not disruptive to the flavor - 4.00, M: Slight effervescence to the beer, medium to light in body - 3.50, D: All around a very nice Dubbel, very drinkable - 4.00"
"D okay. Complex. Probably good with food. I would have this beer again."
"A nicely constructed beer, which I've come to expect from the boys from Cooperstown. A wonderful rendition of the style with all the earmarks of some of the best versions. It loses a little of its luster in the aftertaste, but not enough to ruin the experience of a well-crafted beer."
"All told, this is a pretty nice beer. Price point of 6.99 makes it a good choice when I'm feeling in a belgian-y mood. I'd like to check out their trippel."
"Overall, a very strong choice. This would be outstanding with a nice steak served hot off the grill. I'm looking forward to my next Ommegang choice."
"Nice drinkability rounds this one off with very high marks for me. Another stellar Belgian recreation take from Ommegang."
"All in all it was a very good beer that I wish I could drink more of."
"drinkability- I could have a few of these"
"D: Very smooth and deliciously sippable with a lot going on for the malt lovers. Excellent beer to have one or a few of with friends."
"An excellent Abbey Dubbel. Authentic-tasting for American-made. Ommegang strikes again!"
"A very subtle flavored dubbel which may be the result of high carbonation washing some of the flavors away. As it settled it certainly got better."
"Lighter body, but a good amount of carbonation. Some warming alcohol, but not overwhelming. Very enjoyable"
"I decided to leave the taste at 4.5 (although I wish the rating system went in quarter point increments, lol). On my second go-round, I could taste the alcohol more, but that didn't lower my rating, it just kept me from the full upgrade to 5. I appreciate the ratings system on this site because I can see just how elusive the all-perfect 5/5/5/5/5 beer will really be."
"As others have said, surprisingly drinkable and though this is marketed and categorized as a dubbel I'd say it would make a nice compromise between a dubbel and trippel. Looking forward to trying the rest of their beers."
"M & D - Creamy and full bodied with nice frothy and crisp body. High drinkability even with the 8.5%."
"D: Highly enjoyable and very tasty beer. Rich enough that I would not likely want to have more than one at a time though. ABV is restrained and price is reasonable as this is a domestic take on the style (and a great one at that)."
"D - Well one and done. I didn't like the Three Philosophers that much and the Hennepin was good, but this was so so. I enjoyed the Brooklyn local 2 more."
"Ommegosh, Ommegang is one of my new favorite beers. Upon pouring the beer, very nice head with beautiful yeasty smells arising from the glass. Nice dark color but the flavor isn't overwhelming as many stouts and porters. The smell makes you think it will be overly sweet but I think it offers subtle raisin and plum background with a clove-like nip on the tongue. The mouthfeel is what separates this beer from many other Abbey styles, very silky but not overly coating. The carbonation cleanses as it passes over the tongue. All in all, a delicious, hearty beer from our friends at Ommegang. Nice work!!"
"This beer pours a dark brown with a crimson/redish hue and a lot of foam to top it off (about 3 fingers worth). It is an aesthetically pleasing beer in my opinion, but that's just a personal preference and you can only do so much nit-picking in this category. On the nose, I get sort of a musty, old liquorice mixed with some dark fruits like plums or raisins, possibly cherries too. It's pretty complex for a Belgian-style Dubbel so it was rather difficult to pinpoint all the nuances in this one (in fact, a re-review may be in the works for this reason). The alcohol is definitely present, but not entirely overpowering either; there's a decent balance of taste and spicyness on the palate. There's some maltyness here no doubt, along with hints of nutmeg, caramel, and maybe even tobacco. I would say it's a heavier beer. I believe this beer would make a great pairing for a nice cut of meat, like a steak or some pork chops perhaps. The mouthfeel was slightly bitter at first impression, but this beer definitely grows on you and that bitterness quickly dissipates into a sweeter full-bodied beer. In terms of drinkability, I would like to have this beer occasionally, probably with an entrÃ©e or even a dessert, but not so much of an everyday type of beer. However, it suffices to say this beer could be had at anytime or anyplace with enjoyment, but better suited to the occasion of fine dining."
"D- Delicious and drinkable, but I won't be drinking them all night. after 2, I'd move on to something lighter."
"Glad I only had the one, but glad I had the one, to compare it with others."
"Drinkability: a hearty brew, well constructed, complex, a good example of the style, Ommegang does Belgian beers well is all I can say."
"Overall this is one of my favorites from Ommegang. It is on par with some of the better Dubbels available"
"pepper, and nutty malts. Peach and raisin flavors dominate midpalate. The finish is buttery, with a slick, yeasty aftertaste. It was pleasant enough, but not something I'd revisit too often. And of the few times I've had this, I've had carbonation/oxidization problems with about 1/2 the bottles. So buyer beware."
"This one creeped up on me unexpectedly, so be careful. Will definitely have again, probably more for cooler weather. Another fine beer from Ommegang."
"A vigorous pour into my Duvel tulip yields a gorgeous murky maroon beer with a voluminous tan head that hangs out for a few minutes before leaving some nice, if uneven, lace down the side of the glass. Doesn't smell as complex as I had hoped (though the nose is still good), a clove spiciness from the yeast really dominates. Thankfully, the Ommegang Abbey Ale's taste has more layers to it. The previously noted yeasty contributions are there, along with some alcohol soaked dark fruits (raisins come to mind first) and just a hint of caramel sweetness lurking in the background. The beer is nicely carbonated and has a suitably full body, though I wish it was a little more rich. 8.5%? Could have fooled me, no booziness to this beer whatsoever. I guess I shouldn't be surprised that Abbey Ale is a great beer, Ommegang hasn't let me down yet."
"O Balance is the noteable characteristic of this beer. Definitely recommend."
"M-D: The flavors go together relatively well. Carbonated on the tongue and pretty smooth going down. Overall a good beer."
"Overall, this isn't a bad beer,would share with friends and drink again"
"All in all, this is a good dubbel, but I think the brewers went too far with the ABV."
" ~ This is by all means a solid Dubbel. In my modest opinion I think this beer will be much better having been aged awhile. Good thing for me I have three more bottles in my cellar."
"D- Very palletable and inoffensive, an easy drinker, with fruity complexities."
"D: Very drinkable, despite the 8.5% ABV."
"Overall, this isn't a bad beer, but not a great beer."
"Overall, Abbey Ale is an admirable stab at the style, but doesn't compete with the best that Belgium has to offer. This is a harsh assessment as it's still a very nice beer, but I must compare an American take on a Belgian beer to its Belgian counterparts. Still, this a tasty beer and is definitely worth trying. It was my first Belgian-style ale and really opened my eyes to the world of Belgians, so for that it will always have a place in my heart. Drink it if you haven't."
"In conclusion, this was an excellent beer. It remained highly complex and each sip yielded a new flavor. I must say, for the price, you can't beat this beer. This is currently my celebratory beer of choice."
"Impressions: Complex. It's hard to distinguish exactly what's going on in this beer. I feel like this is one of those beers that you could drink dozens of times and notice something different each time. That does not detract from the fact that it's enjoyable to sip, and at only $6 for a 750ml bottle, this is definitely a nice one for when you're in the mood for a Belgian."
"cheers!"
"Overall this beer is ""just allright"". I am decidedly underwhelmed with this one as I had much higher expectations for a dubbel of this price and roots in cooperstown."
"Notes: Ommegang Abbey Ale is a well-made U.S. version of a classic Belgian style. However, as far as dubbels go, I have not found a beer that equals Chimay Red. While this beer is certainly tasty in its own right, it is not as complex as Chimay, has more alcohol bite, and has less yeast (a dealbreaker for me). For these reasons I would not be likely to choose Ommegang Abbey Ale over Chimay."
"Ommegang Abbey Ale is a decent Belgian style beer. It pours fairly dark, with light colored head that lingers. I don't find the smell to be overly appealing, but it isn't bad. The taste is a little sweeter than you might expect, but lives a slight bitter after taste. Nice carbonation in this beer. Not the best Belgian stlye beer I've had, but it is a decent beer."
"One of my favorites from Ommegang. As many have said, the ABV is not noticeable and is very drinkable."
"D - Surprisingly drinkable. The flavors are not too pronounced like they can be in some dubbels. One of the most complex flavor combinations I've encountered in beer. High ABV, but you could probably drink 3 of these. I'm very impressed. It's the most excited I've been about a beer in a while."
"drinkability - couldnt drink more than one or two of these in a sitting, but this is an excellent representation of the dubble style, enjoyed ths very much"
"Fantastic. If more self-proclaimed 'trappist traditionalist' brews were like this, I would've been a fan long ago."
"(D)- Either my palate has changed/matured, or this is getting close to being just too old. I remember this to be awesome when I had it very early on when I first started getting into craft beer. Its good, but not what I remember. Its much more earthier than fruit driven. . I remember more fruits in this. I will seek this out again & hopefully find a fresher one. Ommegang needs to start dating when these were bottled!"
"D - Drinks nicely for 8.5%. Alcohol nicely concealed."
"Overall, a very impressive beer that I would never turn down. The only drawback is the lack of nose, but the rest of it makes up for that for sure."
"This is a very imperfect, not particularly well-done beer. Overall it tastes good, but it has some glaring flaws and an occasionally unpleasant flavor. For $6 it's not bad, but even on a budget I'd usually go for Unibroue or the lower end Allagash beers over this (or just drop a couple dollars more for a far superior import)."
"dominant in the taste, with a nice, rich earthy flavor following up. Feel on this one is pleasant. Lively carbonation and a slick mouthfeel score this one above average on the drinkablity scale."
"Though not my ideal take on the style but I know a good dubbel when I get one. Farrmhouse-y and very traditional, I would have believed it came from Belgium rather than New York. At less than $6 a bomber I could see where this is popular with the follks."
"A great beer. Definitely one to age if you have the space, as it is good to drink now and will only improve with time."
"Overall, pleasantly surprised with this one. I can see how this has improved over the fresh version, as it's mellowed nicely and has a good fruitiness to it. Good stuff."
"D: Great for the 8.5% ABV."
"D: A very rich brew far better suited for savoring; though I easily made it through my two glasses. I may have even been game for another!"
"Has a pronounced rasin/prune scent to the beer. The taste is dark malts, fruit, and an alcohol burn. Surprisingly easy to take down, goes down smoothly with no adverse after taste."
"Drinkability: Great dubbel. Alchol is evident as it warms but its contained well. Great balance and drinks like a nice full bodied cabernet. Would pair with pot roast, steak and anything that needs a big bold beer to stand up to it."
"Shortcomings considered, this is a great Belgian Dubbel. Ommegang makes really good belgian style beers at typically affordable craft beer prices. This is one of my favorites of theirs."
"Tastes like a mess, in a way. That's not horrible but I'm having trouble picking out new flavors. An orange taste is followed by something that's like over ripe banana and barnyard funk, and also a spice and tart layer underneath all this. Cherries seem to be pretty strong at the first hit or flavor, but subside as the profile lingers. There is also a bit of sherry red wine, but it's real slight. That being said the booze is untraceable in this which I really like. The mouth feel is full enough, I know what I'm drinking is far from watery. I want to say I also taste tea and something very like lemon as well. This is a beer that comes into focus as I continue with it; the malt contains caramel and chocolate without being overt with either of those flavors. Overall an awesome flavor experience."
"Notes: It had been a while since I had it and I was looking forward to the repeat. Back in my early days in the country this was among those that made me want to explore and appreciate US craft beer, the Belgium connect at that time was of great support, not so much anymore... But that is me, while I may not seek it on a regular basis it remains pretty solid and recommendable. Nice to have it around."
"Drinkability: Great beer for the price. Great introduction into Dubbel style. It is amazing how well it hides the 8.5%ABV."
"D: Pretty smooth drinker. Not my favorite style to drink but I am enjoying this one."
"D - for a beer this strong the alcohol is well hidden and mighty tastey. I normally don't score higher abv high in this area but this one was just so good."
"D: I really enjoyed this dubbel. Robust and packed with flavor, yet still highly drinkable. Another great offering from Ommegang."
"Pours a clearish auburn brown with one-finger head that gives a slight bubbly head that sticks around. A great smell that is typical of great Belgians as it has an orange fruit smell, hints of yeasty breadiness and some caramel sugary sweetness. Taste follows as this thicker, chewier beer is full of sweet sugary malts, a lingering yeast note that keeps it balance and even lends itself to a slightly dry backbite. Has some fruity citric notes in there along with some spicy clove to furthur enhance the beer (the fruit tastes even have a little juicy grape/apple note and a tad tart edge). Classic dubbel."
"Second week in a row that I've bought this beer. Its in my top three of Belgian ales."
"Terrific flavor in this one. Some toasted malt, but big sweet/tart fruit with some yeast and light bitter bite fighting through. A bit boozy, but well hiden by other flavor elements. Cleaner finish than I expected. Really really drinkable beer here. Right amount of flavor and body (medium with solid carbonation), with no off flavors. Fantastic and so accessible. A must to try."
"Overall a great beer, really malty but not too sweet"
"Ommegang Brewery recommended a hearty meat dish with this beer, preferably French, so I found a ""Pork Chops with Mustard and Cream Recipe"" (thanks to foodnetwork.com), very tasty. I modified a little, email me for my substitutions, happy to respond."
"D- Overall very good. For the price it's hard to beat."
"D: Drinkability is on par with others of it's kind. But Dubbels just don't seem to have that overly drinkable quality and the alcohol warmth takes away from this one."
"Medium-heavy mouthfeel with an ample amount of carbonation. Good drinkability."
"D- Slightly boozy. This one doesnt hide its ABV at all. Very rich and sweet."
"Drinkability: Not bad. I wouldn't have guessed this is 8.5%. The sweetness would keep me from having several."
"Edit: This a beer that's simply itching to be accompanied by good cheese, so I've broken out some Red Leicester I just happened to have standing by."
"Poured from a 750ml bottle to an Ommegang chalice. This is a dark hazy amber, almost brown. Produced a beautiful off white two finger foamy head that hung around the duration of the beer. Brings nice hints of sweet fruits. Tastes sweet with hints of fruit and a slight citrusy finish. Very smooth and creamy. This is a tremendous American rendition of a Belgian Dubbel."
"Root beer, mascerated fruits and clove aromas. Very warming and slightly bitter. Good viscosity with a definate carbonation bite. Flavors of dried cherry and carob dominate with black licorice notes. Alcohol is well masked in the bountiful finish."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable. A good example of the Belgian Dubbel style. Another winner from the fine brewmasters at Ommegang."
"D: First had this almost seven years ago before I had a full appreciation for Belgian-style beers. Remember it knocked my socks off. Feeling is still there today. An American Trappist-Style Dubbel that rivals most European versions."
"D: Not my favourite dubbel, but an interesting offering and turned out better than I originally thought after first taste."
"Value:"
"I finished the entire bottle by myself, but the 8.5% abv will definitely come back to kick you, so I wouldn't recommend any more than this at one sitting, but it's a great sipping beer. Many reviewers found even more flavors in it than I did, so drink it slowly and see how many different tastes and smells you can pick out."
"This beer is a true classic, my personal benchmark for the style and thats saying something for sure. Pours a deep brown with orange/red highlights and a medium sized tan head that leaves a generous amount of fine lacing on the rim of a the chalice. A wonderful bouquet of ripe dark fruit, dark rich malts, caramelized sugar, a lightly spicy yeast note and a slight wave of alcohol. Full and very round in the mouth, a perfect level of carbonation makes for a larger quaff. Rich enough without being to filling, very well balanced. This beer has endless food pairing possibilities."
"d - It's a good beer to be sure, but it doesn't overwhelm me with complexity, which, for a dubbel, may or may not be a bad thing."
"Overall this beer doesn't disappoint. One of the ubiquitous offerings from Ommegang and there's a reason why. Worth a shot."
"The bottle is a stately 75Cl, corked and basketed, with a red label with heraldic lions holding aloft an O. This is sullied by the instructions for pouring on the side. Upon pouring, I realize how translucent the glass actually is. There doesn't seem to be any indication of when it was bottled. The beer pours easily, with a rusty colour, and a minimal light tan head. It smells yeasty, with hints of banana and pepper. The odour is sweet and creamy. Drinking it, it has a silt like consistency on the tongue. The creamy texture really stands out here, as well as the mild fruits. There's mild carbonated bite to it, but the liquid clings to the mouth, coating it. Due to its mouthfeel, it suffers from lower drinkability. You must pace yourself, or intersperse glasses with either water or cheese, because it becomes overwhelming otherwise."
"D: drink is as good as it can be, smooth, this is one of my top styles and for the price it can not be beat."
"Overall, great sipping beer. I could see myself drinking this again over a nice fire place and chatting with friends. I think this one shouldnt be paired with anything. Just enjoy the naked, unadulterated flavors."
"Overall, a very drinkable Belgian put out by America's own little slice of Belgium, Ommegang brewery. This is my third (I think) beer from them, and I've yet to be disappointed."
"D- It's a big bottle with a strong ABV so if you can get past that, you'll be good to go"
"Overall very good, a ""cozy-down-&-relax"" beer when you're winding down & still want to enjoy some complexity. The beer equivalent of a good book."
"Buy Again? No"
"Served into a pint glass from a bottle. Poured with a nice dark amber color, the red is very prominent. The smell was most prominent with scents of fruits, but I felt the smell was almost non existent. For me it was above average at best, along with the taste. The beer did feel good in my mouth, gave a nice bite. Even though the beer had that going for it, the taste was really lacking for me."
"This is probably my favorite ale for over a year now. Nothing has bumped this out of 1st place for me. I love everything I've had from Ommegang and this is my favorite. Highly recommend it to anyone who loves an amazing Abbey Ale."
"Poured a dark, cloudy brown body with an airy, khaki head. Nose is spicey and dry. Taste is caramel and toffee ride over a light burn of alcohol. Its a bit earthy and spicey but I did not notice much belgian yeast characteristics in this brew. Recommended."
"Overall an excellent nighttime beer. I don't know if I'd be prone to drink this with meals, but later into the night it is perfect."
"All aroun great dubbel, particularly as a warm up to another stronger Belgian."
"D - High drinkablity. This is an ideal beer for a wine lover, but also has plenty to offer to the recovering hophead. Very diff then most beers I've tried - will def be serving this at a future dinner party."
"chances are, you've had this already. if you haven't, do yourself a favor and get a bottle or better yet a 4 pack right away."
"[Overall] - Not a bad example of the style, but not a good one. A very average Belgain Dubbel."
"D: I don't think Belgian Dubbels are for me. It was good to try but I don't think I could have another one. My palate may not be ready for Dubbels quite yet. There's more complexity in the beer than my tongue could discern."
"I have also had it from a bottle, which wasn't nearly the samw experience, yet still a great drink."
"It is slightly sharper and more bitter in taste than the standard Abbey Ale, but significantly more complex."
"D: Delicious brew but I don't think I would enjoy more than a few."
"Ommegang is definitely in my top 3 brewers list. Their beers carry a distinct signature flavor to them and you can really feel the quality in all of them from their look and smell to the flavor and aftertaste. Each one is worth a try for any fan of quality made beer."
"D: This one is a tough call because while I enjoy it (and I'm not a huge fan of dubbels and darker ale, but do like them) I think there are other brews just like this one that are superior in quality, flavor and drinkability. Trios Pistoles would be one example."
"D) A delicious dubbel."
"D- sweet and boozy, enjoyable but one was enough"
"This was pretty much the brew that got me into craft. I'm not sure what happened - maybe my tastes just changed. But I didn't really enjoy this at all and will probably scratch it off my list of favorites. It just fell way short of the true Belgian dubbels - wasn't even close."
"Very drinkable, great abbey ale. I drank 2/4rds of this big bottle and found it so easy to drink this for a high gravity beer."
"salud!"
"Pop goes the cork from the 1 pt. 9.4 fl. oz. bottle. Sampled on December 23, 2009. It pours a handsome tone of burgundy-brown with a generous topping of foamy tan head about two inches deep. Not as hazy as traditional Abbey Ales but still inviting. The aroma is an appetizing balance of wheat, caramel malts, and yeast with only a hint of alcohol in the distance. A well-bodied mouthfeel keeps me interested. The taste is a very pleasingly bitter combination of sweetness and licorice with a subtle hoppy ending. Very authentic. Ommegang gets it right again."
"D: It's a bit too boozy to be an ""authentic Belgian dubbel."" Still a solid Belgian."
"D- Really a solid dubbel; the higher abv and complex flavor profile make it a great sipper."
"Reviewed on 8/9/09. 12 oz. bottle. Pours a cloudy deep brown with a thick light tan head. Aroma of yeast, bready malt, anise star, licorice, molasses, plums, and sweet malt. Flavor of sweet malt (almost cola malt) with spices, licorice, anise star, fig. A good dubbel, a touch on the sweet side (your typical American dubbel). Just ok for me though, nothing special."
"Thick syrupy mouthfeel and pretty drinkable, the alcohol is hidden well. Overall a decent Dubbel, worth trying."
"This is a full-bodied beer on the stronger side of the carbonation scale. I'm not one for lots of fizz, so that's pretty much my only dislike about this beer. This brew has a very crisp feel to it as it goes down and is easily sessionable. I enjoyed this beer very much!"
"Two year old bottle: Classic mahogany pour with a finger of bubbly tan head. Decent retention and lace. Sweet fruity malt aroma - lots of good dark fruit, and a bit BSDA in feel. Some yeasty spice in the tail. Smooth flavour. Again lots of dark fruit. I'm thinking dates, figs and raisin. A good dose of caramel, and a nice sweet spicing that lingers in the finish. Medium mouthfeel, with a smooth, luxurious carbonation. I'm thinking a bit of age on this works well, as the ABV is completely absent. I'll crack the relatively fresh one soon..."
"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle to a standard pint glass. Cloudy copper color with a vey light tan head that starts out thick and goes slowly into a thick film. Great lacing. Fruity spicy aroma. Sweet and sour in taste and alcohol is very noticable. A very complex and well made brew."
"Drinkability: I think I was spoiled by the cave aged version, or perhaps this one should have spent more time in my cellar (I purchased and drank it on the same day), but it seems to lack a depth of complexity; still, quite a nice dubbel"
"D: As far as Dubbels go, this one is highly drinkable. Another winner from Ommegang. These guys do Belgian brews just as well as the Belgians do!"
"Drinkability : This is gorgeous."
"D- this is one of the better beers I've had in a while... definitely the best Dubbel. ABV is well hidden in this balanced brew."
"Toasted sugar and caramel roll malt up front. Yeasty, estery bananas and rummy fruit sweetness follow. Some plum, more caramel, and cocoa near the finish. More delicious yeasty spiciness in the finish, with lingering estery fruits. Full-bodied with lively bottle-conditioned carbonation, and a creamy feel. A delicious classic, that rivals Belgium's best!"
"I'm very impressed with this. I'd place it in my top 5 easily. Maybe top 3."
"I can't believe I've never reviewed this one as this was one of the first beers I had that made me realize beer could have tons of flavor. It used to be one that I had about one every week or so and started my love affair with truly great beers. So I picked one up to have with thanksgiving dinner and like always it didn't let me down. It pours a dark brown with ruby highlights when held to the light. Has a nice tan head that leaves some nice lacing. Smells great. Lots of sweet dark fruit aromas, with a nice bready yeast in the background. Also picking up quite a bit of alcohol as well. Taste closely follows the nose. Nice fruity flavors, like plum and fig. Has a slightly sweet burnt sugary notes as well, and is slightly alcoholic. Very carbonated with a nice clean dry finish. Very nice beer from a great brewery."
"Pours a cloudy, ruddy amber with a lighter copper along the bottom of the glass. One inch head of a pale tan color. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of alcohol, sweet malt, dark citrus (cherries/plums), sweet malt, and slight tart malt. Fits the style of a Dubbel. Mouth feel is smooth and slightly thick with an average carbonation level. Tastes of alcohol, citrus, tart malt, sweet malt, and slight yeast. Overall, a great body, blend, and appearance."
"update: This is a world class brew on tap. draft version is beautiful. sweet but with a creamy mouthfeel. not as cloying as it is from a bottle"
"Last had at Ommefest. Just as I remember it being such a great all around beer, great color and aroma. Plenty of spices and slightly sweeter aromas with nice dry finsh, so good. The most solid brew that ommegang makes year in and year out. The dark brown color and full flavored palate makes me wonder why so many other breweries are making crappier beer for more money. Truley a gem I think we all overlook."
"Future outlook: Very good drink, and readily available. I can easily envision crossing paths again."
"D: Very drinkable IMHO, I could drink 2 of these and be all set at 8.5%. Certainly a very respectable beer and Brewery Ommegang is doing a right good job up there."
"Flavor is interesting for awhile, but the mouthfeel really detracts from the drinkability of this beer."
"I think I may tend to confuse fusel alcohol flavors with Belgian yeast flavors, miscategorizing fusel beers as ""belgian tasting"". While I don't typically prefer beers of this style, I'm digging this one - maybe I need to try some other good belgian style beers."
"Plus, who the fuck quotes Montaigne on a beer bottle?"
"D - A very smooth drink for the alcohol content, but still not the type of beer I could have several of."
"Another great brew from the crew at cooperstown. Glad that these beers have finally made their way to Oklahoma. I would stay and write more, but my glass is empty and the rest of the bottle is calling my name. Cheers!"
"Drinkability is pretty good on this even at 8.5% can't go wrong with this ""Belgian"""
"D: Definitely more of a sipper than a session beer. It's a decent Dubbel, especially for the price (750 ml for $5.50). I just wish the booze wasn't so apparent in the smell and taste. I'm going to throw the other half of this bottle into the fridge for an hour and see how that changes the experience. I'll edit my review if I find any sgnificant changes."
"D:This is a beer i could sit buy the fire and sip all day or night or both but i would want to make sure i had nothing to do cause after a coupple of these i would not wanna stand up."
"Pours from the 12 oz. bottle a somewhat hazy iced tea-ish brown color with the traditional huge Belgian head that quickly settles into a thick collar. Very active carbonation, quite a few bubbles rising through the brown haze. Aroma is sweet and fruity...my nose picks up hints of peach, apple and apricot. first sip is almost orgasmically delicious! Raisins, plums, peach, apricot, caramel, honey... all soaked in a rum like alcohol backdrop...but the alcohol acts a a compliment to the chorus. Present, but not overpowering. Mouthfeel is rich, creamy & tingly with some alcohol bitterness on the swallow, but again, nothing overpowering. My, oh my! Simply fantastic!!! Now the Baseball Hall of Fame drops to second place on the list of reasons to visit Cooperstown!"
"Medium body; not much ""fizz"" per se, more like large bubbles that ""bloom"" in the mouth. Very drinkable, almost scarily so for an 8.5% beer."
"Drinkability- very good, I enjoyed it thoroughly,will drink it again"
"Overall I wouldn't mind drinking Ommegang Abbey Ale again, but compared to the Rochefort 6's I have hiding in the closet, it might be a while before I pick up another 750 of this beer."
"Dubbels are as drinkable as Belgians get for me. Great taste and nice carbonation without the heaviness of a Quad makes a great drinking brew."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a strong biting carbonation, just wonderful."
"D: Tasty, delicious in fact. I would drink another and buy another 4-pack. Too funky and too much late booziness to be perfectly drinkable."
"Definitely a tasty brew, and I will have no problem finishing this bottle and probably another, but not quite at the Rare Vos level."
"D: A very nice take on the style, I could really get into this one."
"(12 oz bottle poured into trappist glass) Poured a deep brown/mahogany color with beautiful head and lacing. Aroma reminiscent of sugary fruit and toffee. The sweet aroma does not disappoint as the taste brings forward a nice caramel note with a great malt sweetness. Finishes crisp with a slightly bitter note, but overall an excellent mouthfeel and predinner compliment to cheese, or (as I had it) a beautiful compliment to chocolate cake!"
"The mouthfeel is a decent medium, a little too much carbonation results in a thinner feel than I would like."
"poured with a fantastic, foamy, frothy, textured, off-white to light tan head and infinite lace. Color is a lovely, clear coppery amber. Aroma is yeasty and malty. Flavor is dates, figs, raisins, and dark bread. Body is great as is carbonation. Finish ditto. Session beer??? mmm dunno"
"Drinkability: Easy to drink a few but the sweetness makes it hard to have too many."
"D-- Very nice beer. Very dinkable and the ABV is well hidden. Still I really like the smell of this beer. Very easy to drink and enjoy a few of these. An Excellent US version of a Belgian style"
"D- It's a tough one here, I wanted to give this one a higher drinkability rating but given its sweetness and being as heavy as it is, I just couldn't make it through more than one. I'm actually pretty happy I didn't go for the magnum bottle"
"Finishes with a touch of sweetness. A nice American brewed Belgian-style ale."
"D - i've yet to of tried a bad brew from my boys(and girls) down in Cooperstown. this one is no exception. easily the best American version of the style, and a personal favorite of mine."
"Drinkability: Sadly this was my last last one, I've been saving it for quite some time now, and as you all know: the greater the wait, the greater the reward. Over the years that have passed since I first tried this Ommegang, it's certainly gotten more pronounced in the bitter areas (the same as with humani generis, I guess). Final line is, this beer holds everything you could expect from a genuine Trappist so if you can get a hold of this Yankee Doodle Brewski -- go for it!"
"D - This beer is complex. Take your time with it and really enjoy the flavors. Simply delicious."
"D- VERY VERY drinkable... a perfect fall or winter nightcap... and the alcohol is very well hidden!!"
"Taste is delicious! Burnt raisins, brown sugar and baker's chocolate. Dinner roll bread notes mix with fruity and spicy yeast esters and creates an almost nutmeg-like flavor that is quite enjoyable. Mouthfeel is not as creamy as I would like, but that is a minor complaint. This is a damn fine ale and a year in the cellar seems to have improved this beer by a good margin."
"D-Too sour for my taste."
"An amazing Dubbel. Hard to believe this came from New York and not a 16th century Abbey."
"D- This is not a beer that I am going to have a lot of, but finishing a glass is no problem. Perfect for after dinner or even pre diner, this is a great beer that I will be purchasing again."
"Poured a nice deep brown color with a little bit of head and a bit of lacing. Deep malt scent, hints of fig and alcohol. Deep flavor, very strong and malty; hints of fig that were nearly overwhelmed by the alcohol flavor. Very warming on a cool day, but I wish the alcohol flavor wasn't quite so noticable; after all, an 8.5% dubbel can have it masked."
"Still think this could go a bit longer. Would like to see it mellow down a little more."
"the pour from the 750 mL bottle produced a generous head over a deep amber brew. I could not comment on the smell as it was allergy season and my sense of smell was compromised. The taste, however, was exquisite. The strong malty, estery, tangy flavor included apricot and toast. There was moderately strong carbonation and very little hops presence. Definitely on the buy-again list."
"An excellent Dubbel."
"D- It has a very cloy 8.5 abv I plan on finishing the whole 750ml."
"A very good double, not too sweet or heavy, just right, dry yet fruity...a complex, multigeared beer"
"M/D: Perfectly carbonated with a medium-full body, goes down so smooth as it warms up. I can't taste much alcohol, even at 8.5%. Drinkable, but I don't think I could do a whole bottle. Definitely a special occasion or desert beer."
"D - For a nice big Dubbel this is extremely drinkable. Balanced, if not slightly muted, but this almost makes you just want t drink more to enjoy the great flavours that are there."
"Drinkability: It's very good, however the fruit attack was a little much for me. I would have to be in the right mood for this one again."
"Ommegang has done an excellent job with this beer, can't wait to try Three Philosophers and Hennepin."
"conclusion: will have to let the rest of the case rest until the first snow. try it again in front of a fire and see if it gets any better!"
"Highly recommend"
"Good complexity, a nice homage to the Trappists that stands on its own. While it's certainly a solid offering, I find myself not sure if I like the whole 'be like a red wine' thing. It's done with class, but I think it's distracting."
"I broke this beer out at a barbecue the other day to show one of my neighbors what real beer is, needless to say he put down his Miller Lite and wanted to drink my entire bottle. Brewery Ommegang was started in 1997 in a traditional Belgium style farmhouse located four miles south of Cooperstown, New York. Demand became so overwhelming that in 2003 Brewery Ommegang was sold to the Belgium brewery responsible for Duvel Golden Ale and now Ommegang brews are made both in Belgium and Cooperstown. This particular brew is made in Belgium is the first beer produced by Ommegang and was inspired by the ales produced by the Belgium Trappist monks. This beer pours nicely into a dark red brown color with a nice fat foamy head. The aromas are full of Belgium yeast as well as some fruity and nutty notes. The palate is full and robust with breadiness that dissipates to fruitiness as you reach the exquisite finish."
"D: This is a very nice sipping beer. Ommegang Abbey is a great example of the dubbel style."
"This paired quite well with beer bread,Chimay cheese, and Drunken Goat cheese."
"D-This is a fine example of an Abbey dubbel ale. Deep and complex, heavy yet still quite drinkable. It's a wonder that I hadn't stumbled upon this brew earlier."
"A wonderful belgian dubbel style ale. I got a bottle of this at the local BevMo. It pours a deep copper color with a large fluffy head that lasts. Its has a nice fruity aroma backed by a super sweet malt character. Its pretty heavy bodied, a great dessert for after dinner."
"I want to like these beers. Doble's to belgians are like browns are to american styles. Not my favorite, too much malt to base character ratio. I made one and was so hapy to get the style right but it's not my favorite style. It needs to be lighter, higher in alcohol or both; every other style of belgian. Not a bad double, good color, but it's hard to like these."
"Maybe its that sort of red wine characteristic, that a Dubbel should have no business involving itself with. I think Ommegang is a great brewery with a lot to offer, but this is not one of them for me. With the American Dubbels I've tried so far, maybe I should go back to Belgians for this category. This beer had no maltiness to speak of and I believe that a Dubbel should definitely have this trait."
"I must say, this is an amazing beer. Even as an IPA lover, this has really turned me on to the style. I look forward to trying Ommegang's other beers in the future."
"This is my first beer by Ommegang. Overall I'm very impressed. Pours a thick brown and let's no light through at all. Not much of a foamy head but what's there laces the sides nicely. Taste is of roasted nuts or even a bit of chocolate. Very rich and powerfull. Toffee also comes to mind. I like this and will be coming back for more of this one."
"This is a top 10 beer for me."
"Verdict: Ommegang Abbey is a thoroughly tasty proposition and nicely authentic for an American brewery's Dubbel. Well worth a try."
"D: A sipper, but goes down nice and smooth. You have to remind yourself not to guzzle while you drink it."
"D: A delicious Dubbel, and another fine beer from Ommegang."
"D: Very drinkable beer. Alcohol is well disguised."
"Overall: Good drinkability, a little on the sweet side, but dubbels usually are. Nice fruit character in the smell and flavor. The alcohol smell up front is a bit off putting, but as the beer warms it fades to a strong dark fruit smell. The end becomes a little less sweet and a bitter flavor appears which helps to make this a bit more drinkable."
"This is one of the better doubles I have had. I really like aroma and the fruitiness of the flavor."
"Get this beer if you can."
"Drinkability is high, a very tasty dubbel that has aged beautifully."
"Drinkability: While the flavors are amazing and the mouthfeel is great, the ABV really packed a punch and therefore, I have to say it's moderate, a bit better than average but not quite mellow enough to be a 4 on the scale overall. I will definitely be going back for more of this brew though."
"I really enjoy Ommegang beers - as far as per style, this beer hits the spot. For me personally, I'm not too in tune to it."
"Notes - This is a treat fresh and I am aging one too. N ot a knock your socks off great but still a nice beer."
"Bought a 12 oz. single of this for about $2... pours a beautiful ruby red with a nice big head to it, some slight lacing is left on the glass. With aroma I pick up a lot of dark fruits and other sweet smelling things which smell good, but can't quite distinguish. Taste now.. great mouthfeel and body to this one, very smooth and creamy going through the mouth. Again, some raisin/fig type of flavors with a sort of spicy finish.. finishes a bit dry for my liking but for its ABV it's way too drinkable. Reminds me a lot of a good red wine too.. lots of flavors going on here and very well balanced.. might be the best American Belgian I've tried."
"The mouthfeel is nice; it's very crisp and medium-bodied. This Dubbel is so inviting, which makes me say that the drinkability is definitely high. Two thumbs up Ommegang."
"CHEERS"
"very good drinkability. i noticed more flavor and smell come through as it warmed. i paid $5.99 for this bottle and was very pleased. i guess i would buy it again if given the chance. not an everyday drink, definatly something special to share with friends."
"Drinkability: Excellent for the style. I will certainly get this again. I love the fruity flavors."
"Drinkability very nice would be a great beer for a nice stew"
"D- Dangerously drinkable in the aspect of a dark strong ale. Try it, it will not let you down."
"Purchased from Ray's Liquor in Wauwatosa, WI. Poured into a snifter, this beer was an extremely dark brown and looked a bit hazy. It had a fluffy off-white head. Aroma of grapefruit and citrus, reminiscent of a white wine. Full bodied with flavors of molasses and brown sugar that lead to a pleasant warming aftertaste in the back of the throat. Good drinkability in spite of the alcohol content."
"GO USA!!!! BEAT BRAZIL!"
"A potent brew, I can only do one glass before I feel the effects, but I still love it. One of my favorite offerings from Ommegang."
"Great beer - I will be keeping an eye out for this around town."
"dark aroma, smells spicy, some fruits (dark/dried) and some sweetness. Perhaps a caramel/toffee or sugar taste. flavor is similar, but with an extra sweetness to it. nice medium feel with a sweet taste ending with a bit bitter and dry. good feel, enjoyed drinking"
"Pours dark black with a dark tan head that stays. The aroma is faint, of coffee and dark fruits. Taste is mildly sweet and malty balanced well with mild hops. More sweetness and fruit as it warms. Very pleasant, though I enjoyed it more from the bottle."
"One of my favorite dubbels."
"i will review this beer again."
"As the beer warms, the alcohol definitely becomes more noticeable and the drinkability decreases."
"D: Very high. I would buy this beer by the case. The brewmasters at Ommegang struck gold with this brew."
"Prost!"
"Drinkability: much like a crisp and refreshing wine, extremely drinkable for a higher alcohol beer and for one with such a fruity and alcoholic flavor."
"D- Good drinkability, all around a nice Dubbel."
"Drinkability - For such a complex ale to be brewed in New York and offered to the masses for less than $8 per bottle is a blessing. If you're interested in trying the Belgians but are put off by the high prices, try anything from Ommegang; it won't disappoint."
"overall: unreal beer, one of my favorites thus far in my beer adventure"
"Pours a beautiful reddish yellowish brownish color with an explodingly tight tan head. I still haven't gotten my pour technique down with these corked bottles, just can't seem to keep the mountain of foam away. Smells of cherries, spices and citrusy sticky hops. Tastes like cherries, and the malty spices come through. Mouthfeel is surprisingly on the lighter side, and hardly a hint of alcohol. Drinkability is great with the complexity coupled with a light body."
"Notes: This is, obviously, a well-made beer that features some good flavors that I enjoyed. But, this is just way too sweet for me. Very good representative of the style, but dubbels just aren't my cup of tea. If they are yours, however, seek this one out for sure!"
"Of all the flagship beers in America, it would be hard to convince me that Ommegang's Abbey Ale isn't one of the best. It is sophisticated, layered with aroma and flavour, pairs well with a diverse range of foods and, above all else, is an absolute pleasure to sit down and get to know over the course of an evening. If you've yet to become acquainted I suggest you introduce yourself."
"D - Very drinkable with a well balanced, but complex malt profile. The yeast contributes the necessary fruit notes without any hot alcohol and the hops never assert themselves, but are still able to contribute balancing bitterness. This is a great example of the style, and the price is pretty much impossible to beat."
"This beer seems to offer the sweetness of a Quad but with only the complexity of a Dubbel."
"overall - i have had this beer many times with mix results. sometimes this beer was way too hot boozy but this one was perfect(this bottle was 1.5years old)"
"Served in a tulip glass."
"A 750ml bottle split with brothecannon. Poured into a pair of Chimay goblets, this ale greets the eyes with a hazy crimson red color with a full inch and a half of thick bubbly light tan head. The head lasts until the bottom of the glass leaving a nice lace on the inside of my glass with each sip. Nose and flavor consist of fruity figs, spicy yeast, caramel, apples, plums, and bread. Medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Alcohol is not overpowering, but lets you know it's there. Worth a try. A few tries actually."
"Ommegang NEEDS to start putting the damn date on the bottle."
" An extremely tasty beer, but it does seem to enforce limits on you. I can only find them in 750ml bottles around here, and two of those is my absolute limit. By that point, any more is just wasting a good beer, because the 8.5% abv will kick in eventually. I also like to enjoy this one with food. Actual meals, rather than just beer and nuts."
"t: very fruity and malty. dark fruit, like figs. honey-like sweetness with a malty underpresence."
"Dr. Oh yeah!"
"D- A fantastic sipping beer. Hard to believe this comes from a US brewery. Great representation of the style."
"What a complex and delicious taste. All the other aspects of this one are well done, but the taste is something else. So smooth, so tart, so sweet, so bitter. This is a beer I regularly buy."
"Highly recommended for any occasion. Very drinkable. Very crisp and fluffy on the palate."
"Poured this one out of a 750 mL bottle into a goblet. Poured a great dark red color with a thin, tan head. I really love the color of the beer, but desired a thicker head to round off the appearance. The smell was very good! Mix of a little tartness, maybe citrusy with something sweet hiding in the background. Couldn't quite put my tongue (nose) around it though. Initial pour into the mouth brought a real fruity palate. Swishing it around really changed the taste. Stronger on the tip, a little sweeter near the back. What I really liked, though, was the carbonation. This beer really danced around on my tongue, which I quite enjoyed. The alcohol felt a little too prominent, though. This is a really good beer, but I don't see myself buying it with any great regularity. Definitely worth checking out."
"The mouth is good, medium body, high carbonation. Very smooth, alcohol is non-existant. Nice. This beer goes down damn smooth, I could drink a lot of this."
"D: Extremely drinkable!! Would I drink more? Hell yes!! I believe everyone should experience this one. I would even say you should share this with a friend. The entire 750ml bottle weighing in at 8.5% ABV is leaving me feeling good!"
"D - I wouldn't drink more than one or two of these at a time. Ommegang is a good beer, don't get me wrong, but I wouldn't be able to deal with so much flavor at once."
"D. This is a unique take on a Dubbel. This is almost a cross between a Dubbel and a Flanders Red/Sour Ale. It works for me."
"First of all, I'm not that big into dubbels. However, I had to give this beer a try based solely on what a fantastic beer Hennepin is. Poured a chestnut brown with maroon highlights visible when held to light. Big, rich and creamy head. Smell was rich with malt and hinting of dried fruit and spices. The taste confirmed the scent. Dates, raisins, and plums were most prevalent. The silky smooth mouthfeel was fantastic and carbonation was spot on. I liked that this was a little less sweet than other dubbels I've had. This brew was a pleasant surprise and I will definitely be buying it again."
"A very fine beer I enjoyed drinking. If someone asked me to provide them an American example of a Belgian Dubbel, I would have a hard time coming up with a better one."
"Had this in a bomber at White Dog Cafe in Philly. Poured a dark amber purple color with a nice cream colored head. Smell was very malty and lightly fruity, maybe grapes with a slight bitter hoppy note and spices as well. Taste was super smooth medium body with perfect medium carbonation. Faintly fruity taste with strong malt and faint caramel notes. Nice balanced hoppy finish. Incredibly smooth and easy to drink beer. Excellent to have with dinner, fantastic beer but not overly complicated so as to complement a meal."
"D- Good, but I don't think I'll be able to drink two bombers. It's heavy, but delicious."
"This is a good drink. This beer has a lot to offer to both veterans and those unaccustomed to Dubbels. I will pick it up again if I'm in the mood."
"Not my favorite dubbel. Brothers Thelonius is more enjoyable to me."
"D- It may be that I just got off work and was dying for a beer, but this was much easier to drink than I expected. It's something that I'd have to remember to pace myself with, or I could see an evening with these ending in disorderly conduct unbecoming of a lady..."
"Poured a deep red, dark and clear. Beautiful thick head. Strong fruity aroma with a nice caramel malt beneath. Taste has strong cherry undertones and is surprisingly sweet. Strong carbonation detracts a little from the mouthfeel in my opinion. The taste remains fruity and caramelly (true to the scent) all the way down and the sweetness remains for a bit after the beer is gone. Quite satisfying."
"Pours a rich dark body with nice lacing. Smells sweet on the nose with honey and burnt sugar. It is light to the scent with deep perfuming scents of malt. On the taste it is complex and smooth with deep malts and a good bit of fruit. It is spicy and dry on the finish and still refreshing. Great carbonation and not as full-bodied as the color would denote. I paid 6 bucks for this because I spent the rest of my money on Westmalle Tripel, with that being said it is a tremendous beer."
"Notes: overall pretty mellow dubbel. easy drinking and certainly delicious. in my opinion not quite as flavorful and brother thelonious"
"An amazing beer, definitely a new favorite"
"One of the finest beers I've ever had. I don't own a cave, but maybe I better start storing some Abbey Ales in the cellar for a few years. A memorable beer drinking experience."
"From the bottle this pours a murky carmel color, thick and dark with a scant off-white head and bits of lacing. The aroma brings spritzy sweet malt and root with some chocolate hints. Pleasant and decided and very nice. The flavor is a very good brown bread, molasses and a touch of clove. There is some toffee and licorice but tons of malt here, brown sugar, sweetness in a medium body drinkable brew. Fine carbonation, very satisying as a substitute for dessert but may be a bit too sweet for some situations or tastes. Very good and well worth a try like most Ommegangs."
"No issues with a 750ml bottle, could easily continue onto a second Very drinnkable. Highly recommened."
"Overall: You should be drinking this right now. Go buy a bottle. It's not that expensive. Go now. Stop reading."
"drinkability: I was pleasantly suprisd, it's not overrated, smooth and easy for how stong the ABV is."
"M and D: Medium-bodied with tons of yummy carbonation, though the beer is still smooth going down. So easy and pleasant to drink, and the alcohol really sneaks up. I look forward to cracking open another 750 soon!"
"D: Tremendously drinkable. Not something that you would want to drink all night, but that is not what this is for. Seems to me to be a perfect desert in itself, or something to accompany a rich, chocolatey desert...maybe topped with raspberries...mmm, now I'm hungry..."
"This is a nice beer, with a complex array of brooding, Autumnal flavours. Although I'm not a huge fan of the finish, it really only lingers, there's nothing unpleasant flavour-wise on the back of the palate. In fact, the more I drink the more I'm thinking the tartness is just a nice fruity character. I might mark it up 1/2 a point. I might not."
"Overall a good brew, but not something I'm seeking out again, especially with Allagash Dubble on the market (which slams this brew, in my opinion). The flavor only confirms my suspicion, that this beer passed through some level of filtration, and was then re-innoculated. It just seems too boring for a truly unfiltered Belgian."
"Still, a great beer and worth checking out if you have not."
"D: High. A good dubbel, but not a great one."
"Full bodied and complex with good carbonation and a medium finish."
"A pretty good dubbel, but there are better ones out there. Definitely worth a try, though."
"Served from a twenty four ounce bomber. Pours nice with a three finger head that dissipates slowly with nice lacing. The nose is very fruity with a bit of spice, and the beer is fairly carbonated. Very good first sip with fruits and malts. slight bitterness in the aftertaste mixes well with the fruitiness, and keeps the beer interesting. At 5.69 a bottle this beer is very good value for the price considering the cost of other Abbeys. Highly recommended."
"The price of this at $6 along with the general solidity of this beer might make this a go to belgian for all to enjoy. Recommended!"
"All and all a great beer. You can see why this is in the upper echeleon of beers."
"Final Thoughts - Definitely purchase this beer and give it a try. My favorite of the dubbel style. Each new drinking experience provides new flavors, and additional character. Very affordable at $6-$6.50 for 750 ml bottle."
"After trying Hennepin right before this I must say Ommegang has something really good going. They create brews that could rival true Belgians. This particular brew was very dark in color but light in flavor and body. Very nice and complex."
"D: I don't drink too many Belgians, they're something I'm trying to get into more. This was pretty well balanced, very intense flavor, though I felt it was too boozy. Overall an excellent beer. I'll probably have to give it another try."
"Smells of dark fruit and sugar, tastes not far off. Plums, brown sugar, and almost a buttery aftertaste. No bitterness to speak of. Not overly carbonated or too flat. Good mouthfeel. Pretty potent stuff, couldn't drink too many of these."
"Drinkability: A rich enough flavor that one is very drinkable but one a night is enough."
"Glad to see an American beer that can hold it's own with the Belgians. I can see why this brewery has received the accolades it has and it deserves them."
"Taste: The flavors are fairly fruity and herbal. Dried cherries, cloves, and more raisins. This beer definitely delivers."
"Pours a cloudy, very dark burnt copper with warm, reddish edges, and billowing tan head that lasts and lasts. Sweet smells of raisins and molasses with a nice yeastiness. A taste that makes me throw both hands in the air...""shoots, scores!"" This beer is right on the money: a complex array multi-layered malts,rich toffee and dark fruits like raisins and dates. This is an exceptional beer. Body is very finely carbonated and holds together in a way that allows you to appreciate its heft (whereas some dubbels are overcarbonated and practically explode on the tongue without giving you the chance to savor the flavors)."
"Overall: The mouthfeel is carbonated, spicy, medium body, and warm. The finish slightly bitter and medium finish. The beer is good and very easy to drink. The body to me is not quite there. It has a nice rounded and spicy flavor to the beer."
"Like this one a lot. While not a big fan of the sweetness of some dubbels, I feel like I miss it a bit in this one, but I suppose its a nice break from the routine. Definitely worth a look; Ommegang seems to consistently have the best beers in the Belgian style outside of Belgium."
"D 4.0, It's a rich intense dubbel experience. I like the higher than usual carbo, but this one is a sipper given it's dense dark fruit notes. Not a session beer in my book, but a solid dubbel for sure."
"Dark amber colored beer with a rich slow fading head.Aroma is dark fruit.Taste is the same dark fruit,sugar cane and caramel.This is the fourth beer I've had from this brewery and I have enjoyed them all.Something I believe everyone should try at least once.Recommended and I would buy again!!"
"D - This beer goes down so smoothly and so nicely...I really enjoyed it...I hope I can find some more Ommegang around here"
"Drinkability - A very good Belgian, but hardly Ommegang's best. Not terrible by any stretch of the imagination; I struggled because I really wanted to love this, but I can't forgive the weak nose."
"A truly excellent and enjoyable beer. Quite complex, but very smooth and drinkable as well. Possibly one of the most drinkable Dubbels I've ever tried. This one yet again established Ommegang as a top-notch brewery with me."
"D: Excellent drinkability as with a friend split a 2 liter growler over the course of day."
"Drinkability is high and I could enjoy this any time of the year in probably any situation."
"A 750ml bottle. Dark brown in color, carbonation evident through the dark color. Small cream colored head which fades somewhat quickly. Minimal lacing. Aroma is a rush of fruits and sweet malt. Very syrupy taste, like maple. Not bad but not what I was expecting. Smooth finish. Not very drinkable, one is more than enough to be sipped over an extended time frame. Almost tastes like cough syrup after awhile"
"Poured into sturdy Chalice. Poured a deep, dark reddish-brown with an off-white head that left a moderate amount of lacing. An assertive, fruity nose with a slight spice aroma. The flavors follow the aromas, with the fruity taste prominent on the front of tongue and a lovely spice finish. A full, balanced, well-rounded body that wants to curl up and snuggle with you. A versatile drinkability, if you're just having one with dinner or several with other activities. An absolutely marvelous beer, either as a treat or a daily staple."
"Poured from 750mL bottle. Pours a reddish brown color with tons of frothy off white head. Smell is sweet and all candy malty scents. Taste is very sweet and in your face Belgium malt, yeast, and cane sugar sweetness. Taste is bold but leaves the palate quickly. Medium bodied mouthfeel that really coats the mouth. This is extremely drinkable as I'm easily putting down this bottle alone. Hides the alcohol very well. Very good Belgian style ale."
"Brewery Ommegang says every bottle is worthy of celebration. I concur. If you haven't tasted this, get one now."
"Dark reddish brown with a huge rocky head that rises about a half inch above the top of the snifter before settling into a thick collar that sticks a lot of lace on the glass. Smells of mascerated fruit, candy sugar and raisins, very little hop in the nose. Tastes exactly like the smell with a good hit of warming alcohol on the back end, has an almost vinous quality. Tons of seltzery carbonation in the mouthfeel. A really nice alternative to the pricey trappist brews. Good stuff."
"D - Fine Dubbel with plenty of complexities. This was actually my first Ommegang, believe it or not!"
"Pours a deep reddish brown with a 1 1/2 finger tan head. Smelled the malt sweetness upfront with a strong aroma of brown sugar and some raisins. Taste was good but left a medicinal aftertaste that was overly pleasant. Beer smoothed out as it warmed. Carbonation was fine and the body was as expected. Drinkability was ok for me. One, maybe two for me."
"A really nice take on the style, though I would like to see just a shade more sweetness and a hair less tangy yeast."
"Pours a dark red/brown/black. Tannish white head, very fine bubbles, creamy looking. Good lacing. Very lasting. Very flowery, alcoholy, syrupy sweet. Strong floral taste. Dark fruits like plum, and a walnutty taste. Nutty aftertaste. Not very alcoholy, which is good. Not as hoppy or floral a taste. More malty. More tempered as it warms up."
"D'ability - Not overwhelming for an 8.5% ABV beer, and the relatively dry finish enhances the drinkability."
"Better then the bottle I thought. Yes, sacrilege, I know."
"This is definitely a good beer, i feel that its a definite down grade from the Three Philosophers that ommegang puts out but still this is a great beer. Definitely very fruity malty and tasty goodness. Worth trying and worth trying again. This brewery puts out continuously some of the best examples of American Belgian beers."
"An excellent beer that I would recommend that all try, and if they have I recommend they try some more."
"d - I think I'm still working on an ideal pour. Even pouring slow but with enough speed to get a head going these Ommegang bombers seem to be a little too bubbly for my taste. I've also tried pouring too strongly in the past and it ends up flat. Here's to continued practice! All that said, I think a bomber will be a fine amount and go down quite enjoyably."
"I thought this was OK, and it is one of the few bargains remaining in the craft beer aisle of Discount Liquor, but I'd still be reluctant to recommend."
"a thick and rich beer with a strong carbonation to complement. feels awesome in the mouth. very drinkable at 8.5%! the flavor has some rough edges but it's pretty accessible even through its deep complexities. overall a wonderful beer to have around at a reasonable price. I personally love it."
"M&d: decent mouthfeel and drinkability. Ny first dubbel so I can not raealy compare to the style. All I can say is I have not been let down by OmmegangN they continue to impress."
"Again, I seemed to be impressed by this brewery and hope to visit it someday with such stellar beers coming from them."
"A deep amber to a red color, with a beige color, an inch thick and has incredible sustainablity. A malty sweetness is dominant in the scent with touches of yeasty bread, with bit of sugary sweet, fruitness. The taste starts with a strong malt flavor, with a yeasty fruitiness, a dried fruit sweetness and finishing with a mild bitterness. a creamy teaxture, with a bit of chwiness, it leaves the palate dryand clean. This is a well made dubble, bring that maltiness in the flavor, the creaminess in the feel, and the yeasty esters. Those aspects make this a must try beer, from a great american brewery."
"If you like this style, you'll likely love this beer."
"Recommended and worth the price."
"Deep red to bronzed color, mostly opaque, the head comprised of lots of miniscule bubbles, slow to fade, sits there like moving isn't in the picture. Mixture of fresh black fruits and glazed fruits in the nose, more raw brown sugar than manipulated sweetness, maybe some fresh honey, the roasted malts build as it warms, scents more smooth than invasive. Medium-bodied, very balanced for its weight, gives it a semi-relentless character. Here the red cherry, raspberry, golden raisin flavors ring more clearly, not fruity per se but you'd have to be a moron not to taste the fruit. As a result, the roast is sweeter with more caramel notes. Carbonation level is average, more upfront, dies off. Feels like a well-worn autumnal blazer, nothing fancy anymore but moves where and when you want it to. Truncated end worrisome, though."
"This beer is by far one of my favorites. There are loads of flavors to be explored in this brew. It seems like I find something new every time I revisit this classic, stand-beside brew. Worth the 50 something a case. Also, when set down for a year of so, it becomes quite divine and the layers of flavor really develop and the alcohol taste take a backseat. Do yourself a favor and go pick some up!"
"Frankly, this beer is f***ing fantastic."
"The beer has a good carbonation level to it, in addition to its medium body. The beer is fairly rich, creamy and smooth. The beer is highly drinkable, but the ABV sneaks up on you and it is noticeable after two. Overall, this is an excellent, if not exception beer. Highly recommended and I think that I will be heading to the beer store to try it bottled."
"Impressed!"
"Very good brew and one of my top six by style."
"Drinkability is good for such a strong and complex beer. A lot of strong tastes that all balance each other well. Nice beer that pairs with a lot of different foods very well."
"Simply superior."
"M - High carbonation - very high. Decent mouthfeel, crisp and very dry. Not a favorite of mine - trying to appreciate the style, but that's about it."
"Na Zdravje!"
"Mouthfeel is slick, crisp, goes down very smooth. Leaves a little bit of an oily feel on my palate. Although sweet, it's not overboard, and this is an extremely drinkable brew for its ABV. An excellent dubbel as Ommegang never, ever disappoints."
"D - Decent but a little sweet and thick to be sessionable."
"Good mouth feel with a warm lingering candy taste. Beer was true to style for an American ""Abbey"" ale."
"I opened a bottle and poured some into a snifter. It pours a nice burgundy color, with a decent pale tan head. The head didn't last very long and there wasn't much lacing. Smelled of figs and dates. A very pleasant beer to drink, it has flavors of sweetened, dried fruit (reminded me of apples) . I was very pleased with this abbey ale and believe it could go down a bit too easy!"
"T: A delicious dubbel that is easy to find and a decent deal at $5.99/750mL -- an excellent beer at a great price. Drinkable and complex -- an exceptional Belgian ale."
"As for drinkability, I can't knock it too much over personal taste but I would not buy this one again."
"At $6/750ml this is a real value. An excellent example of the style from Ommegang. Might be worthy for the Carbonade, but I'd add more and reduce it if substituting for a Westmalle Double. No worries about bitterness building when cooking with this. I'd like to put some down in the cellar for a year or two and see if the complexity builds."
"I very seriously considering getting a bottle, but at $17 was just too much. They seem to have plenty of it, so if it's still available in a few months I'll pick some up. They also said they are getting ready to retrieve some cave aged Hennepin soon, and that their new Tripel is done, just waiting to go out. Maybe waiting on a label approval?"
"taste is smooth, prunes, raisins, touch of cherry, some cocoa, burnt toffee, some malt, ends thick, somewhat bitter, and tangy on the tongue."
"Pours a deep, ruby amber hue beneath a great two-finger beige head. The foam linger as a nice film. Herbal toasted malt is the first thing that comes to mind. Very bready with some Belgian brewing spices in this nose. Pleasantly sweet caramel notes drizzled on sweet wheat bread. A little viney towards the finish. Great carbonation helps enhance all the flavors of this beer. Upping the complexity and drinkability of this 8.5% beer."
"Pours a hazy dark brown with a very foamy tan head. Smell has some sweet notes and fruity characters, some strong spices, a hint of alcohol, and some yeasty smells. Taste starts spicy, them moves to many fruity notes, then finishes with some yeast notes and alcohol tones. The aftertaste is mostly a subtle fruit flavor. The mouthfeel is smooth with a nice balance of many flavors, a medium light body with nice carbonation. This beer has nice drinkability, a higher ABV might be a reason not to have too many, but a quality beer with great flavor. Definitely a beer to check out."
"This was one of the first U.S. microbrews I ever had, and I remember initially picking it up only because it was a Belgian-style ale--the kind of beer that made me turn a corner and the sort of beer I was obsessed with for awhile. It probably tasted more exotic to me in those greener days, but wow, this is still wonderful."
"(rated Aug 21, 2007)"
"D- Overall a ""sipper"" brew, but still very smooth and drinkable. This is good beer..."
"Coolly solid across the head, like planed wood shavings on a workbench - made from something heavy, but in this context, easily moved with a light puff of air. A solid brown color gives way to shafts of ruby and amber, each containing a defining characteristic of the beer. Once this ceiling is broken though, it's like biting into a piece of fleshy fruit - dry, but growing juicy, seemingly filling your mouth with carmelized sweetness. Light, airy, and pretty stimulating, and deceptively strong, with only a mild hint of alcohol - almost an undercurrent, enveloping your tongue."
"D - The complex flavor is enjoyable, but the high ABV and carbonation mean only one per sitting for me."
"Very nice brew and a wonderful introduction for me into the Belgium Ales. Even with it's higher ABV, this could be a real nice beer for a long evening."
"Overall, I really enjoyed my second offering from Ommegang and look forward to sampling more."
"Had this 750 ml corked bottle sitting in my fridge for a couple weeks before breaking it out late night after a movie. Poured a dark reddish brown in a tulip glass with a thick, almost two inches thick, solid foam. A caramel, raisin sweetness on the nose and the initial taste was one of sweet raisins and yeast very much in the forefront, really dominating the malt and hops. Maybe a little roasted malt in there. The flavor was a also a little bread like, and the yeast had a certain zippy spiciness to it. Liked the complexity to this one, and really enjoyed this one."
"D: I don't think the sweetness is overdone, there is a nice balance though it is a strong beer."
"I'll temper this review with a disclaimer: I'm not a huge fan of dubbels. Here we go: Pours dark burgundy, almost opaque. The head is huge and takes a while to settle. Aroma of overripe apples and sugar. Taste is sharp at first, then mellows into sweet malts and the baked apple and honey flavors. Sticky, sweet, but good enough."
"D - All said and done, this is a pleasant beer. As the bottle states, it can be cellared. And I think a little cellar time may do wonders to balance everything out. The 8.5% ABV is masked remarkably well and, for a Dubbel, this drinks very easily. Not in a hurry to buy more, but definitely a worthy candidate for cellaring."
"I can tell it's a good beer, just not ready yet."
"Pours a dark ruby red with a creamy, slight beige head. Lots of yeast floating in the bottom of the glass. Aroma of cherry, yeast, alcohol and spice. A nice amount of carbonation of front with a tart herry flavor. Very spicy with hints of cherry, honey, and lcorice with a slightly dry finish."
"750 ml. bottle. Poured a dark brown, almost cola like, off-white head that disappears quickly. Aroma is sweet, figs, chocolate. Taste is sweet, carmel, slight fruits. Better as it warms up. Alcohol is well hidden as it makes a very slight appearance in the finish."
"Drinkability - too high! I could easily drink too many of these. The rich, spiced flavors, with the satisfying-yet-refreshing mouthfeel, all while hiding 8.5% ABV. This one can easily sneak up on you!"
"D = Ended up giving this average drinkability mostly because I ended up confused on this beer. It is very distinctive and I could see loving it and wanting to come back again and again. At the same time, I am probably going to wait awhile because of the mouthfeel."
"Drinkability - below average.... not too different from delerium nocturnum if you like that, but way too sweet for me"
"Drinkability - Fair. No trouble finishing the bottle, but not sufficiently impressed to want more."
"D - Well, I do know that I probably won't get through all 750ml of this beer. The phenols actually make this a little sickening here during my second glass. This may be destined for a drain pour."
"i will def try this one again"
"This is the best beer I have ever had. It is rich tasting and very full of flavor. The head pours about 1.5 inches thick and it stays in a nice cold frosty mug for a long time. It is the best bang for the buck beer when it comes to price/taste/ABV%! When I want to impress anyone, I bring a 4 pack over and have never had anyone say anything negative about this beer. When it comes to great taste and value, this beer beats them all. If you have never tried this beer, you are missing out on one of the best beers ever made."
"D: A nice Belgian style ale from here in the states and a good deal as well."
"Acquired this highly anticipated brew during a recent road trip to Texas. A deep, dark brown brew sits under a fluffy tan head. Retention is excellent. As the bubbles pop and the head slowly fades, a craggly lacing is left behind. Nose is somewhat unique and spicy, with raisins, sugar, and notes of taffy present. Tastes of dark fruits and a bit grainy at first with an earthy essence mixed into the equation. A slight, but lingering bitterness resolves things in the end. This one isn't too big on the carbonation, with only a slight burst of bubbles upon a good shake. This brew doesn't weigh too much on the palate, and actually floats just a bit, resulting in a tasty yet quite drinkable experience."
"Well done!"
"Pours a nice ruby color... thick head at the start, but diminishes and almost no lacing. Aroma is fruity with peppery notes. Flavor is similar to that, with a bit more of a metallic tang than I would prefer. Flavors also bring out some fruit. I prefer the 3 Philos to this one..."
"Pours a reddish cherry with low transparency. On top sits a three finger tall almond cap of delicious looking froth. The nose is chocolate and caramel blended with dark fruits,a hint of alcohol. The flavors are in line with the nose,leaning toward the caramelized dark fruits and alcohol side of the spectrum. I taste a bit of spicy pepper,I'm sure it's the yeast. The body is medium to light and could have a bit more assertiveness,although it's not a wimp either. Bubbly carbonated feel with a very soft,yet lingering sugary stickiness. This lacks the captivating/it factor for my tastes. A very good Abbey none the less."
"Drinkability: Really nice. Warming and hearty. Despite a lackluster nose, a really fine beer one can easily get their hands on."
"I popped open a 750 ml bottle and poured some into tulip glass. It pours a pleasant burgundy color, with abundant white head. The head leaves quickly sans lacing. This ""abbey ale"" smells of drunken figs and dates. A very pleasant beer to drink, it has flavors of sweetened, dried fruit with a phenolic finish. A crisp and dry ale. A nice medium bodied sipper, that if you do not watch out could suprise you with its 8.5 ABV."
"D. A marvelous brew that is enjoyable as a nightcap or dessert beer and probably any other time as well."
"D - Pretty drinkable for the abv. Some solid flavours."
"Notes: Yet another great offering from Brewery Ommegang and a great way to honor the Belgian tradition of brewing."
"Don't drink and review."
"The aroma was spicy with some fruit tones coming through. The taste was full of brown sugar, fruit and a super spicy finish. It was less than average carbonated and didn't leave much of a mark in the mouth. Overall I thought it was good but not great. I will give it a try in a few months."
"A complex offering that revels so many different flavors and a joy to sip. A little boozy but not overpowering and for the price it's outstanding. Ommegang does Belgium right..."
"Color is a dark brown amber with a thick foamy cream colored head. Aroma is of sweet malts, various fruits with a smoked winter-esque feel. A thick lace of foam retains with the beer long after the pour. Giving the beer a swill, more volatiles are released, evoking the sweet aromas of banana and fruit pie. Taste produces a mouthful of wonderful flavor, fruits, spices and hops abound the palate with a slight alcohol-heavy aftertaste. As the beer warms to room temperature, the sweetness of the beer becomes alive, producing an entirely different feel and texture. The one downside of this ale is its 8.5% ABV on what is a dangerously drinkable beer. Overall a fine specimen and another reason why Ommegang continues to live up to all the hype."
"This beer is totally disappointing. Its not that its a bad beer, but aroma and flavor are just largely not present. Its neutral the way that Guinness is neutral to an experienced drinker. If you are not a fan of the general style then its a strong flavor but i just expect more character then this from an abbey ale. There is a slight after taste of pennies, which is annoying but even that is so faint its nearly not there. Its very drinkable, because its neutral, but not actually good. Have it with food instead of diet soda."
"Pours a deep ruby brown with a tasty looking cashew colored head. A little too cloudy to see any carbonation, etc. Smells malty and sweet with some dark fruits and spices. Taste reminds me of a good rye/wheat bread, or more like a fruit bread/fruit cake you'd get around the holidays. One of the more enjoyable Dubbels I've had. Feel is a tiny bit on full the side of medium and a little sticky. I am consistently impressed with Ommegang. I tried all of their beers at a festival once, but it was late and inappropriate setting experience the magnificence of this brewery. It's since I've joined BA that I've really gotten into these beers. Hennepin is a staple in my kitchen now, and I've had fun with Three Philosophers too, (had some with sweet potato fries once, great pairing!). I think I'm gonna go scoop up some Ommegeddon (one of the few I haven't tried) after work tomorrow. Fantastic beers at a really friendly price."
"M/D: I liked the level of carbonation, which is pretty high and sticks in the throat during swallow. Should be expected from the head you get when you pour though. This beer is way too heavy and high in alcohol content to drink many, but damn is it good!"
"Ommegang strikes me as just an all-around awesome brewing company. Who else can offer $6 750s of kickass Belgian-style beer? And in this economy no less. I'll take this over a near-$7 sixer of domestic swill any day,"
"Very tasty and highly drinkable brew."
"Another tasty offering from Ommegang, my favorite brewery at the moment."
"Its a good beer, specially for the price."
"D: ABV is 8.5%, could have a couple, not a lot though."
"What a beer for $6! An amazingly complex brew. I don't know how much this is different from the regular, non cave-aged, but I intend to find out."
"I wouldn't drink more than three in an hour though. It has some kick!"
"D: Finer carbonation would help drinkability more, but this is still a good beer. Nice flavor, wonderful aroma, and it looks great. It's an affordable, domestically produced Belgian-style beer that I'll be buying again."
"Drinkability for this is pretty high for me, nice overall beer which I would purchase again."
"Excellent beer! Pours beautiful dark and creamy with a fantastic head. Smells and tastes like a Belgian beer - what can I say? That mean's its good. Excellent balance - alcohol is blended very well, but gets to you after a whole bottle. That's okay though! I'll be getting another one of these for sure to put back to back with the Chimay Blue. Recommended for sure!"
"To this point, it is my favorite Ommegang which speaks a lot. Went beautifully with blue cheese covered home made pizza with balsamic fig glaze."
"This is a pretty smooth sipper and a solid treat. Should be a staple in anyone's fridge. It does everything well."
"D- This is beer is like dessert to me. While I could drink another one without any problem, it seems like it would be overkill."
"A great bomber, that improves as it warms, and leaves you seeking the next sampling."
"I feel like I drank a different beer than everyone else reviewing it. The beer that everyone else describes sounds incredible. So, feel free to ignore my review, but I can only go on my own experience."
"Poured into my Chimay chalice, this deep amber brown liquid produced a shallow off white head. The smell of malt, and bready yeast is the first introduction to this wonderful brew. The taste is up front malt,with somthing of a plum type nature,finishing with a sourdough yeast like bread component. Nice carbonation to clear the palate for the next sip. No apparent alcohol presents for the 8.5% it's hiding. Dubbel done well! I love this brewery."
"PS... I was drunk when I wrote this another reason to love those strong abbey ales."
"Nice beer that isn't to tart or sweet, but very balanced and full. Not my favorite dubbel, but one of the best Americans."
"D--Probably not something I'm going to drink a ton of in one sitting, but that's not the point. A single bomber poured slow and savored is better than even a pot of tea for these cooling temperatures and the color show they bring to the northeast. So damn satisfying!"
"Very good example of the dubbel style. Well done Ommegang."
"Little to no heat for such a strong ale, the drinkability on this is amazing. I could guzzle it easily, and I look forward to each sip."
"Greatest beer for your dollar."
"Deep, dark red color with a small head that clings. Not a very pungent aroma but indeed pleasing; some citrus and alcohol. The taste is earthy and medicinal with a dry aftertaste. There's dark sweet notes as well that float in and out of the streams of alcohol and touches of black pepper. This is a medium bodied brew that could do very well accompanying cuisines with lots of spice, think Asian or Indian. A beer that is meant to be drank slowly to savor the flavors and alcoholic kick."
"Bottle Artwork - Elegant label... Nice cork... Label color is reminiscent of beer appearance... Yellow text compliments bottle... Love the font selections..."
"Drinkability: Very easy to drink. The 8.5 ABV is not a factor here and the bottle goes by very quickly. Tasty, complex, quite drinkable. Very good choice here."
"Pours a deep amber color with a tan head. In the aroma, candy sugar and a small fruitiness. In the taste, candy sugar stands out, small fruit, and a sweet maltiness. A smooth and medium mouthfeel, and a dry fruity, banana like, aftertaste. Very similar to a true Belgian, although heavy on candy sugar, but very nice."
"This was not a beer for me, I have had dubbel's before and enjoyed them but this one had too much going on for my tastes. The cherry flavor was too strong and reminded me of children's cough syrup. I had to force myself to finish the glass because of this and while I may give it another shot to be fair, I don't see myself drinking much more of this."
"Another Belgian success story from Brewery Ommegang. This dubbel was sweet, fruity and aromatic just as described. It paired particularly well with a mild, orange cheddar. Pick up a couple of bottles if you can and be sure to share with a friend."
"Deep amber color topped with a thick long-lasting tan head. Roasted malt aroma, with hints of fruits. Taste is burned, blackened, roasted malts, and a little sweet cherry flavor then on to a candy-like tangy finish. Full-bodied and rich. A very solid brew."
"The flagship brew from this famous brewery. Gorgeous deep mahogany color which becomes cloudy when the bottle is fully decanted into my glass. Tan head with orange highlights, thin, tiny bubbles, good lacing. Head quickly reduced itself to a skim. Sweet malt, candied fruits and fresh bread in the aroma. So smooth! Complex flavors of toffee, floral hops, alcohol notes and a long finish that ends on a caramel note. Truly a layered beer. Great balance, medium/light carbonation. More ALC% as it warms and toasted malts as it approaches room temp. Impressive example of the Belgian style being made by an American company and a gratifying experience."
"Not the best bottle of Ommegang I have enjoyed (so far, the best has come from Cork's in Mansfield), but still quite tasty. One of the best breweries in the US."
"D: Ok in small doses, but the sweetness would make it hard for me to drink much of this. A nice beer to sample, but if this is a typical example of a dubbel, I think I'll rate it as one of my least favorite styles."
"Drinkability is moderate. Good flavors make for easy drinking. The high carbonation really ruins it for me though."
"Drinkability: Overall it is a gteat beer."
"Pours a cloudy chocolate brown, with a medium tan head. Smells of licoriche and honey. Very aromatic. Taste is very malty, with hints of rasins. There is a tiny bit of Belgian yeast strain flavor as well. Very tasty. Mouthfeel is smooth and rich, carbonation levels medium. An easy drinking dubbel (especially for the ABV!) that tastes great."
"D - I'll finish the bomber, but that's only because it's there!"
"Drinkability: Another winner from Ommegang... you can't go wrong with this brewery... a beautiful, affordable dubbel"
"D - A fantastic dubbel w/ a great repeated drink score. This is big -8.5% and smooth which is a great combo - can't go wrong w/ an ommegang dubbel, like a festival for your taste buds."
"D: High ABV dings the drinkability a little bit. I can see the slight harshness catching up to me over time."
"Good alternative to expensive imported belgians but lacks some characteristics of really good belgian beers. I will buy this again for sure."
"D - Pretty good. I hear it is awesome with some age on it so I am going to have to lay some down."
" good beer, goes good with pork and mashed potatoes. definately something I'll try again"
"Mild complexity is the best way that I can try to sum up this bountiful brew. Pours a deep rich burgandy color with more than ample head that never leaves, there is considerable amounts of lacing rounding out a wonderful appearance. The aroma is a bouquet of dark fruits and spices. Plums, raisins, figs perhaps swirled around some cinnamon and cloves. Mouthfeel is slightly thinner than I was expecting but adequate. The flavor is a toned down version of the aroma, lots of intricate flavors come together to form a very appealing taste. Finish is smooth with a slight alcohol warming, nicely done."
"D= A damn fine American example of a Belgian style ale, and another great offering from Ommegang."
"drinkability - Nice balanced beer, would purchase it again. It does come in big and small bottles."
"A great introduction to the Abbey style! Highly drinkable with nice carbonation, light on the bitterness."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: Pretty sticky mouthfeel. Finishes dry. Carbonation is well balanced. I think this beer is pretty good because I like this style, but I would say it is not my favorite. I think it lacks sweetness. Certainly not bad and definitely worth a try."
"It's a good american redition of a belgian dubbel but not one of my favorites."
"I'm generally not a fan of this style of beer, but enjoyed this beer nonetheless. Not as heavy or as sweet as other dubbels I've tried."
"I don't go crazy for the style, but this was nicely done. Very solid, I'd have this again."
"D- very tasty and rich in the fruit and yeast. A brew that i cuold drink all day in moderation though. This could come up in and bite you in the ass after 4 or 5. A nice beer to play poker with."
"What a well executed brew! Ommegang sets a great industry standard, and this flagship brew really bears the torch."
"D - This is a pleasant beer to drink. The 8.5% ABV is surprising, I just don't get a sense of any significant alcohol content, very well disguised. The carbonation is a bit heavy for my preference."
"Overall pretty damn good, not my favorite style but I enjoyed drinking it."
"Darker, heavier, this ale was a meal unto itself (the .750 L was perhaps a little too much for me to drink practically on my own). A delicious meal, however, and one I'd be glad to have again. These two beers will likely become staples of my refrigerator."
"Full-bodied with an edible biscuity character. Tastes delicious and feels nutritious."
"A wonderful American version of a Belgian dubbel. Pick this up if you enjoy any of the trapist dubbels. I love this with some Dutch blue cheese on whole grain crackers and red apples."
"Poured a deep orange-brown into the glass and produced a good looking orange tinted head that hung around several minutes. With each sip, a tremendous amount of lacing followed the beer. It smeled wonderfully light. Like a subtle sweet maltiness that was balanced just right. Upon first taste I knew I wanted more. A very well balanced slightly sweet perfect example of the Belgian Abbey style. Mouthfeel was light like the aroma and left a bittersweet taste on the back of the tongue. Overall drinability, I would give this one high marks. Great to share with a friend if you can sacrifice half a bottle."
"Dark copper/maroon, cloudy and opaque with a generous head that had excellent retention and nice lacing. Malts and dark fruits evident on the nose, as well as some brown sugar. Flavors of dark fruits - figs and cherries, some cloves and spices, and caramelized sugar. Very soft on the palate, lively carbonation, and a smooth, dry finish."
"Drinkability - I'm not going to drink a bunch of these but I will thoroughly enjoy every sip, very challenging, I'd like to use this for a reduction sauce with roasted lamb chops and of course pour a glass alongside"
"D - Good drinkability"
"Drinkability is what it is. I felt satisfied but did not want another."
"overall a delicious malty treat with a kick."
"Milky, creamy feel. A bitter bite on the way down. A real slow-sipper. Fizzy and bubbly toward the end. This is a very strong beverage. Thick and chewy. Sweeter than expected; quite challenging."
"Very silky mouthfeel, and the alcohol burn is very noticeable. I would definitely have another. For such a sweet and alcoholic beer, it is relatively smooth and leaves me wanting more."
"D: Very drinkable, however the ABV and complexity do limit the sessionability a little. You can not quaff this one like their Hennepin. But sipping and enjoying you can do! An excellently constructed brew and highly recommended. Ommegang is consistently putting out high quality beer."
"Overall - came in a nice big bottle with a cork. Like its cousin, the Three Philosophers, this beer is not for the faint of heart. Goes nicely with a lamb chop or filet mignon. Will buy again."
"When they were fresh from the fridge, I preferred the Belgian (it was more well-rounded and the fruity esters in the American were pretty intense). But as they warmed to room temperature, I preferred the American (when the alcohol & spiciness in the Belgian really came forward)."
"This was a great version of a Belgian strong ale. Kudos to the fine brewers at Ommegang who really know how to make a great Belgian style ale."
"Good American interpretation of the vaunted dubbel style. Highly recommended if you've not tried it; the price alone makes it worth your while."
"Of course, not an ""everyday"" type beer, more like once a month with some beef stew or chocolate."
"Drinkability here is good, I've got 3 more and I plan to cellar 2 and drink the other."
"D) A very good Dubbel with a few little suprises here and there, nothing that I can easily put my finger on, but the subtlety has me stocking my cellar with it."
"Pours a deep red/brown with a finger head that shrinks to a ring in a few minutes. Love the smell... sweet toffee, caramel and raisins. The taste starts where the nose began with more raisins, dates and overripe plum flavors. Then it balances out with a nice hop bitterness that reveals just a touch of alcohol warming to leave with you. A really solid beer that stands up with some of the Belgian Dubbels I've tried."
"D - Good but it does seem to fall short of the Belgians. I'd like to do a blind taste test one day to see. The American Belgians are certainly getting closer."
"D - Enjoyable brew, may be one of my favorite ""Belgian-Style"" brews; wouldnt wanna session this one, but definitely nice when the time is right"
"Sampled on tap at Terrapin Restaurant & Bistro in Rhinebeck, NY. Served in a proper Ommegang chalice. Bar stocks a good selection of NY beers on tap and bartender is quite knowledgeable. Beer was capped nicely by a light tan/toffee toned head that left very appealing lacing. The beer displays a lovely reddish-amber hued tone. The nose is fantastice. Dried fruits, some Belgian yeasts, spicy, black pepper-clove like, touch of malty sweetness in there to balance the aroma out. Flavor is awesome as well. Dried fruits agains, cloves,malts, yeasty, slightly sweet on the taste, but cut perfectly by a great dryish finish of alcohol and spice. Mouthfeel was nice and creamy, yet biting enough to keep the drinker constantly reaching for another sip. Yet another outstanding brew from Ommegang."
"D = It's a good beer but I had higher hopes for this one. I think it had more bitterness than I expected. Would drink it again (will try it in the bigger, corked bottle). It's all a matter of personal preference, but if I'm having a dubbel I'd prefer a Chimay Premiere."
"M/D - Smooth and creamy. Very drinkable dubbel. As good as many of the Belgian Belgians I have had."
"I need to pick up more of this. Delicious ."
"Notes: Pour this in the right glass,if you don't it will be a different experience. This beer is easy to find and a good reputation overall from Ommegang. In addition, I have to say that the drinkability could be better as the alcohol was not well masked."
"M&D- Lots of carbonation and the spices give it quite the kick. This made it not as smooth as I would have liked."
"Poured from the bottle. It is a deep reddish-brown with a nice fluffy head. It smells very sweet, with some fruity scents and also brown sugar. Tastes fruity and spicey, with a little caramel, brown sugar, and malt. It was pretty smooth going down, a tad bit of carbonation. Before I knew it, the entire bottle was gone and I was ready for more. This was priced very reasonably for what it is...I can't wait to try more from this brewery."
"An excellent abbey ale from an outstanding brewery. It pours a dark burgundy color with a thick white head. The body is dark and hazy, full of wonderful flavor and aromas. The aroma is filled with caramel malts, fruit and spice, as well as an alcohol kick in the nose. The palate is full and the alcohol has a nice warming quality to it. Favors of sweet caramel, dried dark cherries, prune, and yeast dance on the tongue. These favors mingle for a time and finish slowly. Ommegang is grate as it is and could be even better with cellaring."
"@@ I also have used this as the brew in making Beer and Gouda soup and it worked amazing. The flavors really stood out in the soup- even with the strength of the smoked cheese the boldness of this could still be tasted...yum"
"D: OK overall, but a little too alcoholic, which I feel takes away a little bit from the beer overall. I feel it was a good example of a Belgian Dubbel. Alcohlic tastes can be a little biting, which takes away from the drinking experience overall."
"This is both a good bargain and a good find. Pour carefully otherwise you'll wind up with a giant head and very little liquid. (The head itself lasts a long time and is wonderful to slurp.) Color is a shimmery brownish-red; nose is quite yeasty but still pleasant. Flavors are very fruity and summery, and a bit bready, but this is good to drink year-round, especially with spicy food. Bonus: the bottle is tall, heavy and thick-walled, and comes with a cork rather than a cap."
"Nice dark brown color with hints of red. Like polished wood. Creamy one inch thick head light brown/tan color. Decent head retention with some lacing. Smells of dark fruit like cherries and other berries put on top of bread. Very interesting on the nose. Theres also something else coming thru that I just can't put my finger on. Drinks wonderfully well. This is one malty brew with mild bitterness on the finish. Finish lasts pretty well. Really enjoying it. Medium-light to medium body with good dose of carbonation that you can really feel when you swallow. Man I wish I had some cheese."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: It's pretty thin. Carbonation is high, but not offensive. Relative crisp and easy to drink. ABV is a tad bit high at 8.5% which hinders drinkability just a bit. No way I'd tackle more than one 750 in a sitting. It lacks characteristics strong enough to warrant more than that. Overall, it's a very solid beer. Certainly one I'll have again."
"Overall well worth it. It costs significantly less than the actual Belgian beers, and does a good job representing the style."
"Poured into a Chimay goblet. Dark red color with a dense tan head that leaves good lacing. Aroma is fruity with cherry and prune. Flavor is much the same, kind of like Three Philosophers junior. Cherry and dark fruits make up the esters while yeast creates a doughy underpinning. Malt is sweet and chewy. Dry finish to a rich palate. Average drinkability."
"This Belgian dubbel-style beer poured a dark crimson with tan head. It smelled like earthy malt mixed with slight floral hops. It tasted like chalky dark chocolate and bitter floral hops mixed with some wild yeast. It was watery with surprisingly no carbonation, and had a bitter chocolate aftertaste. Overall this didn't have too bad of a Belgian taste, but it wasn't very clean either."
" I have paid $12 a bottle for lesser beers. Truely a great one!"
"The very first sip of this American-made beer reminded me of drinking dubbels at Brussel's Delirium Cafe. This beer is a very cloudy amber color. It pours with a thick tan head that reduces to a thin layer in about 8 minutes. It's smell does not jump out of the glass and is a bit too faint for getting a good idea of what to taste. Mouthfeel is very good. The carbonation leaves the liquid mid-sip and makes for a filling beer. Tastes offers bits of yeast, dark chocolate, caramel, dull tones of honey and is overall on the bitter side....but it's a delicious bitter side. The ""True Belgian-Style Dubbel"" marking on the bottle is no lie."
"but honestly, it's deep rich honest amber color and its sublime honey taste truly dealt the beauty of it's taste. i say, most americans would say she failed, but i say hell why not... her honey tongue lapped at my wanton organ with a lust that is unparalleled with the rest of the true belgians, and the monks must be in upheaval over this. true the ommegang lacks the veracity and the luster that the others boast but it's the style we're interested in, right? it's the mere fact that they are attributing the greatness to their prowess, right?? after all, they have accomplished this feat... they are the ones we are after, well after all, as they do what we cannot do... they have managed to brew a perfunctory brew..."
"D - The alcohol and malt tastes are too strong. The aroma is a little harsh and unfinished. Smells like wort. Way too filling. I didn't enjoy this one. New Belgian's version is much better, IMHO."
"D - By the end the slightly sour finish prevents me from rating this higher."
"D - Not overly impressed with this one, I've heard good things about the brewery, perhaps this just wasn't my bag. I'll take the advice of others and give the rest of the lineup a shot, however. As for this one, I suppose it's worth a try if it's not out of your way."
"Although a faintly slick mouthfeel competes with the otherwise full-bodied richness of the brew it's still nice to see an American brewer doing Belgians so well."
"D - I don't think I'll be enjoying the rest of my 4 pack of these. This was a task just to finish. This is not OG's best; go for the 3 philosophers instead."
"Poured a deep red color with a fluffy off white head that hung around and left some heavy lacing. Smelled of sweet fruits with a tartness on the nose. Tasted very thin at first but as it warmed it got fruitier and more tart. This is a good staple belgian-style ale that I will come back to again and again."
"On a second sampling this beer seems much more bitter to me. I am also overwhelmingly reminded of wine, the wine-like character really seems to be coming through this time."
"Too cold of a temperature really did this beer an injustice. When it reached an ideal temp, it had a moderate level of carbonation, almost creamy mouthfeel without being too heavy. Very drinkable, will enjoy again."
"Poured an attractive dark burgundy color with a pillowy white head that hung around a while. Aroma is quite fruity and sweet with a touch of chocolate. Flavor is very much the same as the aroma with the taste of dark fruits and a nice dry finish. Nice beer that I would definitely explore again."
"Had a very nutty, malty flavor that sort of overwhelmed the flavors of the esters that you find in most Belgian beers. The esters come through as it warms, giving it a very sweet taste throughout. Has nice depth of flavor, but the sweetness (needs more hops?) keeps this from going to the next level."
"M&D: Mouthfeel is awesome utilizing good medium body and carbonation that makes the whole experience creamy and smooth. The whole package makes for very good drinkability. An excellent example of the style!"
"Overall- A fine Dubbel especially given the price, not quite great but certainly up to par and at the price you can stock up on em. Fine job."
"Drinkability: Very easy to drink. I think it's great that there are Belgium style beers this good coming out of the U.S."
"Final Thought: This is an amazing accomplishment for a brewery in America to serve these Belgians at still an affordable price. Thumbs way up!"
"I made the mistake of having this be the second beer I drank tonight. At 750 ML, it was very hard to finish in one sitting, but I managed :) All in all, for being an American interpetation of an Belgian Abbey, its a fantastic beer. If you like Belgians, you will love it. And its very affordable. I paid $5.75 at a bar for 750 ML!!! You cant beat that..."
"A very good example of the style, brewed right here in the states, nice."
"A great Dubbel. I'm a huge fan of belgian beers and Ommegang. I really love the idea American brewery devoted to belgian style beers (kind of like the American version of Unibroue). Very affordable - I think I paid $5-6. I would like to see Ommegang produce a Tripel in the future."
"Notes: My first test of an Ommegang brew, as well as a first test of a dubbel and I have to say I am quite impressed. Despite being more of a malty brew, I would go out again and buy this one in a heartbeat. Ommegang has lived up to the hype I had been hearing, definitely recommended."
"This is a fine dubbel - clean, sweet and fruity with a medium body. Deep ruby red color leads into a light apple flavor and yeasty, fruity scent. Major lacing on the sides of a large red wine gobblet. Really even flavors that arent as complex as other belgian style beers but hold up on their own easily. Does nicely as an after dinner beer."
"Didn't take me long to finish this one (only bought a 12oz single). Drinkability is dangerous considering the ABV. Proceed with caution."
"The Ommegang poured into my tasting snifter with a thick head that immediately disappeared. The smell was overwhelmingly sweet with a deep fruity aroma. It is very reminiscent of Barleywine style ale. It was full of the sweet smell dark dried fruit. The color was a deep burgundy. The taste was immensely sweet with a sour finish and malty chocolate notes. I'm assuming that the fizz at the end is due to some type of champagne yeast? Regardless, it is a truly wonderful beer. The more that I get to know the Ommegang beers, the more I like them. I will definitely have to plan a trip to Cooperstown N.Y. in the near future."
"D - Hard to put down the glass. Great dessert beer."
"Very drinkable, but more this style is more of something I need to be in the mood for, rather than constantly drink."
"d: very enjoyable"
"This ia a little to sweet for my taste. It pours a nice dark amber to brown color. Head is 1 finger that sticks around for a while. The smell is very fruity with dark malts. Taste has a lot of dark malts and chocolate and dark fruits. Mouthfeel not as heavy as I was expecting. Drinkability is not as much as sum due to to the heaviness and the sweetness."
"Pours a nice dark brown color, nice carbonation, nice one-finger plus tannish creamy head, which leaves some really nice sticky lacing and small islands. The nose is malty, slight yeast, prunes, figs, raisins, and some caramel. The taste is slightly sweet at first, some nice malts, dark fruit, and caramel. Medium body, a well rounded/complex brew. Very drinkable, this is my second Ommegang brew and it's delicious."
"This is one hell of a beer, better than some of the Dubbels I've had that are actually from Belgium. The chaps up there in Cooperstown certainly got it right. I have one more bottle left that is going into the cellar for a few years, hopefully it gets even better with a little age."
"Drinkability - I'm sure some of these scores are brought down to this brew not meeting my high expectations. This really wasn't a bad brew, but when you go in expecting a home-run a ground rule double just won't do."
"This is the first beer i've tried from the Ommegang brewery and i must say i'm impressed. A very good BSA with plenty of malt in it. Considering the low price this is a beer i'll gladly come back to."
"Poured from corked bottle into Ommegang goblet. Rich, latte-colored, semi-strong uniform head. Natural light root beer color gives a sense of warmness; well-carbonated. Classic Belgian look - appears to be well put together. Spice character of aroma dissipates rather quickly; slight metallic/sour/yeasty overtones, with hints of allspice and burnt cherries. Mildly rich with a relatively short finish. Presence of alcohol is known but not overbearing. Palate is sweet and rich with some toastiness but is tempered by slight tanginess. Carbontation is a little overpowering. Silky and creamy feel is again reduced by carbonation. Good beer to have on a quiet night with a book in front of the fireplace."
"Poured into a snifter. The Abbey Ale pours a beautiful rich mahogany color, with a tan head that drops slowly and leaves great lacing. Wonderful rich malty aroma, slight coffee hints and caramel hints in the nose. Rich flavors on the palate, strong alcohol notes, and good coffee finish. So much malty goodness, the palate goes crazy. Mouthfeel is outstanding, high carbonation and complex flavors make this a very drinkable beer."
"D: A very soothing beer with a great complexity of dried fruit, malting, and spicing and drinks like a dream at 8.5%abv."
"D- I could only drink a couple of these... it's a very rich brew, but it comes in a 4 pack for a reason. Great pick up, I'll definitely try this again."
"Overall... hell yes, age this one."
"D - This beer is a wonderful treat, certainly a one to be enjoyed by it self. It drinks very nicely if you're a lover of Belgian style ales. The 8.5% abv does its thing and does it well. I would not want any more than two, if that, of these in a sitting (as in most cases, this is certainly not a detriment of character, just an acknowledgment of its power). I will definitely file this one under the 'keeper' category and revisit often. Cheers to Ommegang for such a masterpiece!"
"Pours a muddy brown, reddish color with a good beige head. Smell is somewhat fruity, yet rich and creamy with a hint of the clovey hefeweizen yeast smell. Taste is very unique and somewhat highly carbonated. Some spiced sweetness at 1st along with some roasted slightly bitter tastes and some flat licorice like taste in the finish. After drinking half of it, I still hardly know what to think. After it warmed a bit I like it less and am not crazy about finishing it. Definitely drinkable, but not something I particularly care for. This is obviously liked by many, but it is not my style of beer."
"cheaper than the imports, but similar in quality, with some of its own unique character."
"."
"Overall not a bad beer....but I'll stick with Chimay"
"D-This is a very rich tasting beer,I would not call it session beer but it is a nice sipper."
"Though this beer is not the style I typically like it is a fine beer. A bit tarter than I expected. Has strong citrus taste and is carbonated which leaves a bubbly feel in your mouth. This is a very drinkable beer and I would highly recommend it to those who dont think they like beer as it is not very hoppy."
"On the whole, this is a drinkable beer, but I didn't care as much for it as Ommegang's other beers (i.e., Rare Vos or Hennepin). It was a little tart for my taste. Still, a well-produced beer."
"pours an absolutely beautiful ruby red color with a big orange head. it laces a bit more than most belgians i've had. smell is good, fruity aroma with lots of yeast scents too.. taste is heavenly, this was the first beer i ever had that was a stretch from BMC, i had it about 3 years ago, and i remember thinking, how could anyone drink this, but after a few hundred craft brews this is one i wanted to review. anyway back to the review, it has a wonderful alcohol warmness to it as well as a fruity mixture like many belgians have. mouthfeel is very good and full, drinkability is a little hampered to do its high ABV. exceptional belgian imho"
"D- the label is correct when it says this is a beer for celebration. just like chimay, it's way too complex and would be a shame to just crush 64oz of this stuff. that being said, it was no problem at all takin this bottle to the capital."
"Update: Had a 3 year old bottle. Probably held on to it a little bit to long but the fruit really comes out nicely with tons of apples. The malt is just great. A touch of oxidization is creeping in but not enough to detract."
"Drinkability: For a high ABV the 750ml bottle went down very easy. Definitely a beer I could enjoy for a whole night."
"I liked Ommegang's Witte beer, but this one right here proved above and beyond that this a really great brewery... as a Belgian Strong Dark Ale, this is an excellent rendition of the style... From a 12oz bottle, pours a ruby-red, mahogany prune color with a frothy white head that lingered for a bit... Smell was full of figs, prunes, and dark fruit... taste complemented the aroma... strong sweet, thick, creamy, rich flavor... similar to a doppelbock, wonderful flavor that lingers on the palate... very full-bodied and malty... Awesome brew... hard to detect the 8.5% ABV, masked by awesome combination of flavors... definitely recommended..."
"Popped open a 3L bottle at midnight to ring in the new year. It poured a nice dark red amber color with a tall, thick head that came stuck around for a very long time. It had an aroma of sweet malts and some fruity flavoring. It tasted excellent, especially for this kind of beer. It had a very sweet malty taste with hints of fruits, cherries and grapes mostly, and a very clean finish. It had a really nice mouthfeel with a good amount of carbonation and it was very drinkable, which is good because I had 3L of it to drink, of which I had more than a few. Definately worth a try if you like Belgian Beers."
"Its great to see an American brewery consistently make great belgian-style beers. A great offering from Brewery Ommegang."
"D - At 8.5% ABV, this isn't a session beer. It's very good, though. I want another one, but I shouldn't have it."
"Tastes of dark fruits, a little tart but sweet as well, spices and caramel."
"This brew pours to a brown color with some nice amber highlights, a rust like color is how I would explain it. The head is quite foamy, color is tan with some reddish highlights. Some lacing, which could be due to the glass as I would expect some more. The aromas come across as candy, slightly burnt brown sugar, toffee, fruit (maybe plum and/or raisin?) and a slight alcohol smell which comes out more as the brew warms up. The taste is very good, malt flavors are real clear, sweet flavor. Also there is a fruit like flavor hiding in there that seems to come out as the brew warms which ties it self to a more pronounced alcohol flavor. While more of a sipping brew this seems to be a very easy drinking brew, scary with the high level of alcohol. Definitely a very good brew."
"This is my first Ommegang beer and from what I understand they do excellent Belgian style beers. This one is no exception. I can't wait to try some more."
"This is a great sipper that I would gladly sip from again. Definitely a great pick."
"notes: this was a little bit of a disappointment. i got this beer to celebrate the end of the semester with and it just didn't have that belgian flair to it that made my nose and my taste buds go ""wow, this has a lot of freakin flavor!"" I look forward to trying the hennepin though, since people seem to be more impressed with that beer. I've heard good things about this brewery, I just hope that they're true."
"This is a decent American version of a Belgium Strong Ale/Dubble. Not my favorite so far, but I will revisit this beer soon. Still, I would recommend it."
"d: A very nice beer to have around."
"A very nice drinkable Belgian Strong Ale from Ommegang."
"This is a meal in a bottle, so drinkability is based on the fact that this brew would be enjoyed slowly over the course of an evening. You're not going to have more than one of these - most likely. But very drinkable on its own right."
"Update - 030608 - A BA buddy and I did a side-by-side comparison of the Belgium brewed v. the New York brewed versions of this beer. My original review was of the Belgium version. Our conclusion is that the Belgium version had a darker body, more complex flavors, and creamer mouth feel. Both are superior brews but the Belgium version is more like a BDSA and the New York version more of a Dubble."
"D- This is a little on the rich side, but its wonderfully complex. It is nice and creamy on the palate and not sticky. It is hard to believe this wasn't brewed in Belgium."
"This is a beer which I have found the aroma profile to be superior when younger and then the flavor profile more appealing with age. This particular bottle is fairly young, no more than 3 to 6 months of age. The flavor is more fruity with a soft but impacting mouthfeel. For a big abbey ale this drinks very smooth. The alcohol sits well under the malt and flavor profile serving to accent the key notes."
"This beer pours into my goblet with a dark amber body and a thick frothy white head that stays nicely leaving some leave. The smell is full of sweet caramelized malts and ommegang's proprietary yeast. The taste is up front with sweet caramelized malts and the same yeastiness. The mouthfeel is very soft and full. Quite nice. OVerall a great beer."
"All said, a fantastic American-Belgian. Probably one of the five or six best American-brewed Belgian-inspired Ale's. The complexity of a really good quad, the smoothness of a really good stout, the craftsmanship of a really good Belgian. And it's under 5 dollars for a 750. Dollar for dollar, pound for pound this is near the top of any list of great American beers. Absolutely fantastic."
"750 ml. bottle with wire cap and cork. Ommegang pours out a dark ruby-amber color with a vigorous initial head. The aroma is fruity - of figs and cherries. The taste is rich and complex, with black cherries, cassis and plum flavors predominating. It's smooth on the tongue and has a dry finish. It's quite drinkable for an ale of this richness. (Ommegang does a great brewery tour if you are in Cooperstown.)"
"i've always wanted to try this one ; pours a cloudy dark garnet color w/ a fluffy tan head which dissapates quickly leaving a fine lacing throughout ; a rich malty-breadish aroma w/ some fruity spiciness, bannana w/ coriander, perhaps ; a rich, tangy, complex caramely malt flavor at first, then blending w/ a warm alcoholic fruitiness simalar to the aroma to finish crisply ; a med. body w/ alot of carbonation, lingers on the palate enabling one to savor the flavors ; this is an awesome drinking beer, i'm glad i've got three more to go..."
"I cannot say enough positive about this beer, which may well be my favorite. The Mona Lisa of Belgian Strong Dark Ales in the US. Five stars, hands down."
"A fav amongst this style."
"Flavors of caramel, sweet malt, dark fruits, and yet it finishes dry, asking for more. Not a St Bernardus but close, a prime example of american made belgian strong."
"Drinkability was moderate to good I think. Being a higher abv beer I think the beer could get a little too cloying if too much is consumed over a night. One bottle was enough for me."
"D - Pleasant things overall, easily drinkable and definitely worth the value at $6 for a 750ml. Will do again."
"Poured from bottle into a glass, while sitting out front handing out candy to trick or treaters! Lots of head, and it lasted a while too! Nice looking beer! Smelled fruity, malty and sweet. Taste was smooth! this is a very easy drinking beer. Very enjoyable."
"Opened with a pop and poured into a tulip glass. Smell of malt and dark fruit (raisins, figs, plum?) hits the nose. Poured with a fluffy, off-white head the color of mahogany. Decent head retention and thin lacing adherence during the tasting. Subtle and consistent carbonation provides a pleasant mouthfeel; not too heavy and not too light. A little bit of alcohol astringence with flavors of malt, yeast and dark fruit. Pleasantly drinkable, but better for savoring than quick consumption. Enjoyable, but not my favorite from Ommegang."
"Drinkablity: This is a very smooth beer, I could easily see my self kicking back with 2 or 3 of these."
"(12 oz. bottle bought at Central Market while traveling in Fort Worth, TX. Drank from a wine glass as I didn't have a chalice handy. I poured the yeast right in as I like Belgian style beers better that way.)"
"Tastes like sugar & candy - but not overly sweet. It maintains a very good balance. The alcohol is fairly prominent but not enough to knock you on your ass. This beer was pretty damn good. I may have to pick up my own bottle just to sample it further."
"Ommegang does a smashing job making Belgian brews in America and this is a good example."
"D- This is an excellent and complex brew by Ommegang. It has sour, sweet, smooth, and spicy characteristics that blend together very well. The 8.5% is not hidden here-and my 12 oz bottle was plenty for one sitting. I will have this one again-as Ommegang has become one of my favorite breweries. I still have a bomber 3 Philosophers left in my fridge and I am looking forward to trying it. Then I shall move on to Chocolate Indulgence."
"It's good, I never really had a bad Ommegang, but I'll opt for a Rare Vos or a Three Philosophers anytime."
"The problem is the more I taste the less I like it. There is a medicinal and copper metallic flavor that comes forward as the beer warms. Stange beer to me. I taste different flavors with each sip but I don't care for the flavors that are coming to the forefront as when I tasted it at first. Good elements but I don't think I'll buy it again. A steal though at 6 bucks."
"One more note on this beer which I liked, when the bottle was empty there was a good amount of yeast sediment left around the bottom ring of the bottle, this is something you see often in homebrews, but little in commercial beers since they are so often filtered. Not necessarily important overall, but it gives the beer more of that ""homemade"" small batch type of feeling."
"D: Though the alcohol isn't noticeable. This beer commands you to sit back and enjoy it slowly."
"One caution, don't eat with walnuts. Something about walnuts + ommegang gave me the sensation in the back of my throat of having just done a shot."
"excellent take on a belgian"
"This seemed like an exceptional deal at $5.50 per 750ml bottle and I liked Hennepin so here I am. I poured this into a snifter but I bet a wine glass would have worked as well. The color is the darkest red I have ever seen but not quite brown. The head is a craggy rocky fortress of cream-colored bubbles. The smells are like squeezed grapes, wine, alcohol, raisins and I find myself sniffing away as I sip. The flavor is strong, some raisins, long aftertaste of licorice and a slight tinge of alcohol. I think the mouthfeel is really smooth but the beer does coat your mouth thoroughly. The alcohol starts rearing its beautiful head towards the end of the first glass and by the end of the bottle I feel like dying. I drank this while listening to the new 9th Wonder album: Dream Merchant Vol. 2, you should too."
"750ml bottle, poured into oversized wine glass at Bar Americain (52nd 6/7th), Bobby Flay rest with rack of pork. Let the initial redish head go from 1 finger to slim ring. Burgandy color with slight orange glow. Brown sugar with addes spices, malt and dry cherry aromas, quite complex and satisfying, even dates or figs perhaps. Taste is less complex than aroma but retains texture and body. Mouthfeel is somewhat smooth and wee bit of carbonation. Goes down nice and easy but becomes rougher towards the end."
"Poured it slowly and the head almost fell over the side after a few minutes. Then fell a little back, but stayed thick and pillowy 1/4"" head with a kick-butt lacing. The color is a beautiful red color that's dark ruby and just great. The smell has sour dark fruit, not much else. The taste is very sour. It's very bitter/sour with some cork tastes...it's like tasting a piece of wood or sucking on some cardboard. Mouthfeel isn't horrible, not so bad. The aftertaste reminds me of the taste you get in your mouth after puking. Overall I don't think I will ever try this ever again."
"Not sure if I got a bad bottle, but I did not enjoy this. I feel almost bad about dragging down the average, but I'm almost positive it wasn't skunked and there was no sign of the beer being out-of-date. The 750 ml. bottle poured out almost like wine, with a ridiculously frothy head that retained for several minutes. The smell was of fruity and sweet wine without the blatant alcohol. The taste followed afterward. It was incredibly sweet and almost unbearable to finish the whole thing. As a beer-lover I'm not sure how many people would enjoy this brew: almost no signs of hops or balance to the overly sweet brew. Not sure if I'd be willing to pay another $7 to try again."
"This is a very drinkable beer, with little sign of the relatively high abv. It makes an excellent after-dinner beer, but would probably not be a good one to session."
"Continuing to revisit the Ommegang brews now that they have come back to Minnesota. I first had this beer when I went to the baseball hall of fame and took a side trip to the brewery. I brought back a bunch in my carry-on. Their flagship beer is very good, a strong dubbel is how I would describe it."
"Overall: The price of the bottle was a bit much for the overall feel ($8). But if you're looking for something strong, this is a well done heavier brew.."
"D - Easy to finish one, but there's something about this beer that seems a little more filling than usual. I kinda feel full, as though I've just eaten. Still a great beer, and the price is right."
"D: Pretty tasty, goes down quite easily, slightly filling, very good representation of style, nice kick, this is a beer worth drinking for a whole evening if you're in the Belgian mood, but I'm not sure if I'd be able to go past the one large bottle without getting too full. The bottle I drank was purchased in spring of 2007, so it's been at least 6 months not counting the time it was at the liquor store, but it's definitely a lot better than the time I had it fresh at tasting a while back."
"Only gets better the more you drink it. A very satisfying, dark, medium-bodied ale."
"D: Good for an ale of its strength, the only downside was that the carbonation, sort of knocked out the flavour in the beginning, so my recommendation would be let this one sit a while to let it open up."
"If you haven't yet, I strongly recommending visting Ommegang in Cooperstown, NY and picking up some Ommegana Abby Ale at your local beer store."
"Great Belgium style beer out of Cooperstown. Have had this one in the past, but this bottle was bought closer to the source(about an hour away). Regrettably I did not take notes on either of the two bottles of the cave aged (at Howe Caverns) Ommegang that my Brother and I had. If memory serves correctly the alcohol was a bit less present and the beer was smoother. I just need to get my hands on Ommegeddon."
"12oz bottle into a goblet. Pours a dark brown color with an off-white head. The aroma is yeasty with some dark fruits and spices. The taste is rich and malty with some spices and a rather dry and yeasty finish. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy. Drinkability suffers a little from the high ABV and phenols. Overall, this is a pretty good brew from one of the best Belgian-style breweries on the continent."
"Drinkability: Not so high due to the higher ABV but still allowable.... 2 or 3 and you are feeling rather fine."
"D: Delicious - rich and sweet. Easy to drink. Hides its alcohol well."
"Drinkability is above average for the style."
"Pours with a very large, fluffy head. Nice dark amber color. Taste is complex like I have come to expect in a Belgian style. Slightly sweet tasting with spices and fruitiness. High ABV and complexity limits the drinkability, but is quite tasty."
"D- Goes down way too easy- To me, this could be enjoyed by anyone who appreciates flavor and impecable smoothness."
"This is one dark brew, a deep garnet with a fluffy off-white head.Aroma is fruity, pears, passion fruits, plums and a bit of pineapple. Taste is dark and fruity, plums and pears again, but sweet with dark caramel. Slightly peppery as it goes down with a bit of a hoppy bite. A very good sipping brew. My taste lends more towards the lighter Belgians, but I would not turn down this brew."
"Pours dark brown with a good initial head that fades to a cap. Decent lacing. The smell has traditional aromas for the style of clove and banana, and maybe a hint of cinammon. Dry malt underneath. The taste is pleasant if a bit subdued from what I was expecting from the aromas. The flavors are still similar to the nose, but there is less banana in particular. Spicy and dry on the finish and with a bitter aftertaste. There is a good body to this beer. My only complaint about the mouthfeel is that maybe its a little spritzy. Goes down smooth, quite drinkable. A well priced everyday alternative to a nice Belgian."
"An interesting experience, and I'm glad I got it, but I probably won't bother again. It's essential Ommegang, perhaps more pronounced sweetness and cherries."
"In error some are under the impression that this is brewed in the US like some of the other of this breweries beers, it is actually brewed in belgium and bottled there also at the Ommegang brewery then sent to the new york branch."
"Poured from 750 mL bottle with cork top, love popping those corks. Pours very, very dark brown but upon closer inspection its actually a dark amber color. Thick, dark head that quickly lowers into a thin layer remaing for the rest of the beer, nice lace left behind. Smell is of roasted grain, some caramel, and some alcohol. Taste is very similar, very malty with a roasted quality to it, a hint of caramel, and I swear a touch of coffee. Thick and creamy mouthfeel with good amount of carbonation. Slightly lower score on drinkability due to the punch it packs but overall a really good beer."
"Very good beer but for a ""Strong dark ale"" it seems a little weak. Nonetheless this is definitely worth drinking."
"Poured from a bottle into a snifter. The beer pours a dark brown, forming a 1/2 inch creamy tan head, leaving very light spots of lace. The aroma is not as strong as expected, consisting of a strong alcohol presence, along with a little raison/prune aroma. The taste is also not as expected, but not bad. Strong raison flavor, light dark fruits, noticeable alcohol, and maybe some light malt thickness. Very complex. Thick mouthfeel and smooth finish. Very drinkable Belgian. Overall, not what I thought it would be like, but interesting nonetheless."
"Smooth mouthfeel that finishes with some dry carbonation bite, making it a highly digestible brew. This American brew puts a lot of Belgian offerings to shame. Well done. Highly recommended."
"As I carefully evaluate all the Ommegang brews so far this is my favorite. Easily one of the best Belgians brewed this side of the Atlantic."
"D- This is a great nightcap/sipping beer. I decided to give it a try on a fairly warm night and think it would be more enjoyable to come back to this fall or winter."
"Overall, a nice abbey ale. This brewery has put out some good beers and this is not an exception."
"The dark fruit malt flavor is sweet and traces of the 8.5% ABV. I like the 12oz size, but a 750ml wouldn't be outrageous"
"Pours a reddish-brown colour with a small bubbly head. Sweet aroma with some floral elements to it, and a little bit of spicy/moldy/peppery something in there that gives it a unique kick. Flavour is dark fruit and heavy, sweet malt, with a little bit of a peppery hop undertone. Good balance to this one, and well-hidden alcohol. Liked it!"
"The mouthfeel is surprisingly light for a dark ale as rich as this, but I don't get a watery sense to it at all. At 8.5% it is dangerously drinkable."
"Pours a nice two inch head on top of a brown beer with solid amber highlights. A pretty good looking beer, although the bubbles are a little large. Pretty good lacing. Nose is strong brown sugar and molasses, some quality spices. Good, although maybe not the most complex beer ever. Taste is good. Some dried fruit, maybe raisins and a hint of apricot. Lots of molasses and sweet malt. A touch of alcohol on the tip of the tongue. Feel is a little thin, but pretty good. Overall, a solid beer - kind of a standard Belgian Dark, really. Check it out, although I might go for a Maudite over it."
"First impression of its taste: chocolate and caramel, almost like a dessert. Then there is a touch of spiciness and a nice hop kick followed by mellow aftertaste. It's a bit chewy, but very smooth and drinkable."
"First thing i notice is the very nice sweet smell this ber gives off.Very nice.Very dark amber in appearance with a huge head.Hazy in appearance,,and did i mention dark?Slight smell of alcohol but not offensive.Pretty complex beer,slightly tart,mild alcohol feel. A different style of beer that i havent tried yet.As i drink more of an underlying sweetness starts to take shape.Mouth feel is ok could be a bit beefier.Definitely a once in a while beer,but i look forward to trying this again."
"D-This one matches up quite well with some dubbels from Belgium. I think this is more like a dubbel. This is a complex beer good for sipping. I may have picked the wrong month to enjoy this as the heaviness is a bit much for a warm day in NYC. Very good, highly recommended."
"drinkability is great. well balanced. interesting and very good. thanks again jan!"
"A very distinctive and contemplative beer, and quite tasty."
"This beer kicks butt. Wish I had more. Thanks for the bottle demcorhip!"
"ok drinkability."
"I started this bottle with a late dinner and continued to sip it through the evening. Found it to be very drinkable. This beer is in some ways like a liqueor without being syrupy or having that cloying sweetness."
"Pours a brown-ish color. Aroma is that of a belgian-style ale...fruity with raisin tones. Malt aroma is apparent. The taste is somewhat malty as well with some sourness in the back of the throat. Overall, smooth but the flavor leaves me wanting more. Then again, I'd rather judge a beer that's been proper cellared as opposed to a beer that's sat on shelves for months."
"A+"
"Wow, had this with dinner the other night, and I had actually not had it before. Poured a rich deep brown, with a big tan head and very nice retention and lace. Smell was full of dark fruits, prune, raisin, and figs, with lots of spices, nutmeg, and a hint of apple. Taste was very lively, full bodied, smooth, and very crisp. Alcohol is there, but hardly noticeable as there is soo much complex flavor overunning it. Overall this was fantastic, a great belgian ale and something I was very happy to try. I would defiantly wanna have this one again,"
"This is a great beer. The pour was a delight to watch occur. The smell started with some bright green apple, and then settled into a lovely yeasty puff. The first taste was very lively on the tongue, like the citrus you'd find in a coffee from El Salvador. Very lovely. The mouth feel is amazing. One of my favorite beers. The lacing is constant as the cup goes away. Served in an elongated goblet. The taste is very nice. Almost a honey flavor meets a dark chocolate. Highly Recommended."
"Not a brew I was overly fond of. I'll be in no rush to drink the other bottle I purchased."
"Reminds me of Duvel, in carbonation and essence. Fun to try, but I donÂ’t need another for quite some time."
"Pours a cloudy redish brown. Fluffy tan head,with excellent retention,and lacing. Smell is of dark fruits,and alchol. Body is thick,with some carbionation. Taste is sweet fruit,up front with a touch of hops,and alchol in the finish. Very,very good stuff."
"Glad to have Ommegang back in TX. Pours a dark, dark red brown with a dense, rocky head. The beer is almost black and the head is a medium tan. Nice. Smell is fruits with some esters and a note of burnt coffee or bitter chocolate. Or both. More subtle than I would have expected. Taste is very roasted, not fruity at all. It has a bitter component that comes on towards the end, just before a very dry finish. Interesting but not what I expected of an abbey style ale. Mouthfeel has nice carbonation and an oily texture that ties it together well. Drinkability is good, although the overroasting & the dry finish keep it from being really outstanding. I like this one but it really could do with being a bit sweeter. Still, a great product from a great brewery. Nice to see the Americans can do these styles well, if in our own way."
"Poured a dark mahogony color, with carbonation bubbles always flaoting up, a good looking beer! Smells great, rich and fruitl. Not like the light, wheaty fruit beer, this fruity taste was strong and heavy. And so was the taste. I couldn't put my finger on the exact fruit flavors in the smell and taste, but I'm thinking it was a darker berry, like grapes or cherries. A well carbonated beer, which balances the heavier tastes. Tastes great, the flavor sits well in the mouth and the beer fills the belly. One and I was happy and done."
"Easy to drink and highly recommended."
"Pours a reddish brown with a light brown head. Smell is sweet with raisons and a hint of chocolate. Taste of sweet malt, prunes with the alcohol nicely hidden. Medium - full bodied with good complexity that has a carbonation spike going down leaving a slight bitter aftertaste, I'd say a good one to try."
"Overall: an outstanding strong dark and another great offering from Ommegang. Also, I paid only 5.99 for this 750ml bottle... I had to look twice! Strongly recommended."
"Pours out cherrywood with lively carbonation and a khaki head that thins out, but maintains presence. Nose is kind of thin with caramel and roasted malts. Some mild, vague fruitiness. Alcohol stands out. Flavors come out very fruity in the front with hints of banana, apple, and grape. Middle mellows out with the fruit and the alcohol comes in. Finishes dry with some astringency from the roasted malt. Aftertaste is roasted malt and dark dried fruits. Mouthfeel is not cumbersome and the carbonation makes the flavors feel lively on the tongue. Solid take on a Belgian, but really not the most interesting beer made in the Belgian vein."
"I'm watching the Islanders - Rangers game and enjoying this brew with a plate of Gouda cheese and wheat crackers. Very drinkable offering... I have to run, my goblet is empty!"
"Poured a ruby brown color with a moderate tan head, not much lacing. The aroma has a slight chocolate aroma with some red wine or port characteristics, a tad more complex than a dubbel. The taste is a roasted malt backbone with some fruit esters, prune and carob; definitely some wine qualities. The feel is a bit fizzy, moderate body, finishes dry and a touch bitter. Good drinkability, alcohol is hidden well."
"Popped the cork on this, a nice waft of smoky effervescence came slowly from the bottle. The beer is a dark brown-amber color with a thick brown-cream colored head that leaves small gatherings of lacing around the glass. The smell is quite sweet and complex, some wine characteristics; mostly malt. Fruitiness, possibly raisins or dates, Belgian sugars and alcohol are all apparent in the smell. The taste is also very wine-like, with a warming effect from the alcohol. A bit of spiciness complements the Belgian sugars and helps cover the alcohol slightly. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with quite a bit of bubbly, creamy carbonation. The overall drinkability of this beer is pretty good but I think I would try to stick to a single 750 ml bottle. The alcohol does hurt the drinkability of this beer slightly."
"Poured a dark reddish brown with exciting carbonation and frothy head. Aromas were of sweet malts, dark dried fruits and definite spiciness. Yeasts were there but not overpowering. Brew was light in mouthfeel, though it had layers of flavor- great yeasty spices, cloves, sweet cinnamon. Malty finish, and very very dry. Carbonation was aggressive throughout, making the beer seem lighter while allowing more flavors to come through. The high abv was extremely well hidden, but after two 12 oz bottles i could feel the warming effects. Very good effort, Ommegang is on the top of the list of american craft brewers as far as belgians go."
"pours vry dark mine had very little head. There was a suprising amount of carbonation. The aroma was not particularly strong in my case. It has a very wine-like taste. This wine like tatse also had a bittterness too it. Its not a bad taste, could just be my own personal taste but i do not find this brew to be too great. its got a pleasant enough taste but seems too carbonated. Worth a try."
"Mouthfeel was medium to full in the body. Very mouthfilling due to carbonation."
"Overall, Ommegang is very good, right up on par with some of the best Belgium has to offer, but fresher, and (usually) cheaper. If you are a fan of Belgian ales, you owe it to yourself to try this; if you have been put off by domestic imitations of Belgian styles, this will restore your faith."
"Pours a nice, deep dark mahogany brown with ruby tint when held up to the light. My DT tulip glass captures the aromatic pleasantries of the abbey ale quite nicely. Sweet, dark fruit scents as well as banana. Caramel and maybe some chocolate cherries. I get a distinct buttery aroma here too. Extremely complex and well done. This smell blows me away. Taste is in line with the aroma. Rich and malty, with strong fruit flavors - plum, prune, apple, and pear. A very sweet, noticeably tart taste lingers in the front of the mouth before the hop character finally kicks in to balance things out. Don't be misled by my comments, though, because the hops are here purely for balance. They play a bit role in this production. Firm mouthfeel. An all-around quality Belgian ale from Ommegang. Very tasty. Serve with a meal or with dessert."
"D: Given the 8.5 abv on top of 2yrs of cellaring it was surprising drinkable. Still...just dominated by too much unchecked sweetness to be highly drinkable. Really like to drink this over a pretty large span of time as it warms and transforms."
"A nice abbey ale - not my favorite style, but it works well as a sipper. Needs something paired with it, but I'm not sure what..."
"An American brewer inspired by the Ales made in Belgium brewed this one to mirror their inspriation located 3,624 miles away. I think the brewers in Belgium could learn a thing or two from this one. Fruit flavors show up like any other Belgian Dark Ale, but this one comes equipped with a touch of caramel that gives it its own delicious characteristic. A bargain compared to other imports, this one still ranks among the best. Careful with the alcohol though, it sneaks up on you."
"After a two year absence, Ommegang has returned to Texas. This is a 12-oz bottle poured into a Chimay goblet. It pours a very dark, red-tinted color with a tan head of foam (that fades pretty quickly). Nose is ripely fruity, sweet, with hints of caramel. Malty but not sweet in flavor, with a touch of roastedness; plummy fruit notes appear after a moment, and alcohol becomes apparent in the finish. Not too heavy bodied despite the strength, with a smooth mouthfeel."
"Good drinkability. I'd prefer the Maudite to this one."
"A nice one when you're in the mood for a big beer."
"Eric"
"One dimensional but good. Solid 4."
"A well made, fairly drinkable ale that does a decent job of covering up its alcohol due to the depth and richness of this brew. A good choice for introducing newbies to belgian styled brews, and a good choice, even if not outstanding, for the more experienced drinker. Wont be rushing out for more, but can see myself enjoying this one again."
"Poured from a 750ml corked and caged bottle with no dating system. Shipped back from Indy during Xmas - before I heard they were coming back to the Texas market. Had a dark cherry almost bloodish color with a thin head that quickly dissipated - was tannish. The aroma was sweetish with a big burgundy front with a hint of the ABV. The taste was good but not as great as I'd hoped. Will need to try a non shipped sample now that they are back. Mouthfeel was good. Overall, it was a good beer in a style that I mostly like but not a major player in my rotation. Like enough to have again in the 12oz size couple times a year. (4, RB, T, O)"
"Quite an affordable and honest attempt at a Belgian ale, though it still has a ways to go. But if you like Belgian ales it's definitely worth a try, and I wouldn't be surprised if I got this again."
" Body is a muddy brown color with red highlights when held up to the light, topped by a smallish tan head that dissipates to a thin halo rather quickly. Aroma of sweet dark malt, Belgian yeast, and more than a little sour acidity, with notes of dark fruit and sour cherries. Palate is a complex blend of dark malt and candi sugar sweetness, offset by subtle notes of dark fruit and yeasty funk. Finish is slightly acidic, like a good balsamic vinegar. Body is creamy, although a little foamy when disturbed - drink carefully in small sips. Aging definitely changed this beer, although I'm not sure that two years is not the optimal age for it."
"750 ml. bottle- color of redish mahogany , with a thick light brown head - nose of malts , citrus hops , red cherries , deep red fruit , and is bright and clean Â– taste of malts , deep red fruit , hopps , and red cherries - body silky with a little bite , and it has medium carbonation Â– aftertaste of fresh dark red fruit , and bitter sweet thing gong on"
"best of breed - no. Very good - yes. Consistent quality. as good as I remember it. Enjoy!"
"I don't what it is, but I'm missing the boat on this one. I got a bottle with dinner at La Cena, just outside Syracuse to go with some mole chicken. It really just tasted like a strong extract beer to me. Tasted of carmelized light or medium extract with a touch of unpleasant hops. I had one good sip where I tasted chocolate, but the rest was nothing to savor. I will say it at least looked the part and hid the alcohol. Someone tell me what I'm missing, please."
"things are kept lively by a thick body with crisp and strong carbonation. alcohol is definitely present, but never out of place. this is dessert and your after-dinner drink all in one."
"good stuff."
"This poured a very dark, ruddy amber with a 3/4 finger head and nice lacing. Some extra swirling in the glass brings out the head and overall appearance, as well as the fruity aroma. This is rich in apples, plums, and darker fruits. Again, rich and satisfying. The taste is heavy in such flavors with a very slight bitter and an ever so slight dark chocolate flavoring. The mouthfeel is exceptional, perfectly balanced with a nice combination of smooth, crisp coolness that pleases the palate. Always a great go-to, especially considering the price."
"D- I don't like this at all really. It does get a bit better with more sips. Nothing good though."
"A sea of sweetness drown more intruiging islands of delicious earthy malt, dark fruit, butter and molasses; an unfortunate imbalance because this beer has so much to offer."
"The smell was decent, but unremakable. Candy sugar, plums, etc. The taste was similarly unimpressive, and had an unbelievably metallic aftertaste. If I had to describe this beer in one sentence, I would say that it's like Brussels by way of Burton-on-Trent. I felt like I was sucking on a penny, and poured the damn thing out after drinking about a fourth of it."
"pours dark amber with a creamy head. looks perfect. there are some different smells going on, honey and maybe some licorice. slight caramel. the taste is amazing. caramel honey notes with really solid mouthfeel. amazing that this isn't belgian. for the money you can't get any better. i'd pay double for the same bottle. amazing. can't wait to visit this brewery!"
"like other Ommegang brews, too carbonated, which detracts from what would be a nice heavy feel. sweetish tones from the aroma all come through in the flavor in the front, with dark fruits and a toffee sweetness, but it also has a balancing, lasting bitterness in the finish. nice balance makes for very good drinkability; biggest knock from me is the excessively fizzy feel."
"Taste, wow, I have not had a complex Belgian like this in a while. Almost wine like, but in a robust way. Lots of fruit characterisitics, raisins, figs and a little nutty. Yeasty flavors there also. Rather carbonated. Really tart and I think mine was still a little too cool. As this warmed up it got much richer and the malt was a little more present, hops about non-existant. Are there any grapes hidden in here? Very nice and it was much more inviting as it warmed up. I like Rare Vos a bit better( been a long time) and I have not had the Three Philosophers....yet! Ommegang is a very good beer, al ittle too much on the wine side for me, but a tasty treat all around."
"I always liked the Jenlain and Belgium beer , I move to the US and could not find a Beer that I like, So i made some Belgium style beer, this beer as a good all around taste , I love it I even went to the Brewery in Cooperstown NY, this is a nice beer I still need to try the ""3 Philosopher"" from Ommegang, good aftertaste, good color abit pricy for a 4 pack 7.99$"
"A 750 ml bottle priced at $5.85 from the Northcoast Coop in Eureka, California. Deep rich mahogany color with a light brown head, and good lacing. Nose is very complex, with malts, yeast, honey apricot, berries, prunes, caramel and chocolate. Flavor is much like the aroma but even more intense. Mouthfeel is rich and somewhat oily. Dry and nicely bitter finish. Excellent overall balance. While not inexpensive, this is really an excellent Belgian Strong Ale."
"Drinkability: Very kingly, sophisticated and worthy of praise. I look forward to pairing this beer with a meaty dinner or cheese plate. This was a real treat at a great price. I will be back for more."
"Mouthfeel / Drinkability -- What can I say .This is a great beer . Will purchase again . A joy to drink ."
"Oof, I opened this bottle to celebrate the day we brought my new son home from the hospital, but am finding I'm too knackered to do a decent review! Pours a dirty brown with reasonable head. Nice beer, complex flavours. Tastes like a Belgian. Good for a celebration. The 8.5% alcohol and sleep deprivation should work well in, oh, about 10 minutes."
"Overall: An enjoyable brew from a top notch brewery. Recommended."
"12 oz bottle poured into a chalice. Very nice deep orange to red in color with a large amount of pillowy tan head, which slowly fades into lacing that continually covers the surface. Lots of dark cherry is evident in the nose - there is also evidence of alcohol. Taste is fruity with a malty backbone and little caramel there as well. The alcohol is well hidden. The mouthfeel is nice, although I think less carbonation would make this work a little better. This is a tasty beer, but like any Belgian, should be drunk slowly. Sipping is key, especially because this warms nicely. Highly recommended."
"I love this beer. And I love the fact that it's $4.99 for a 750 at Trader Joe's and it's perfect with breakfast for dinner (steak and eggs for me this evening) on a cold night when you're not working the next day."
"Pours a deep reddish-brown tinted chestnut with good clarity. Tan head of thick fizz quickly fills the glass, showing decent retention and leaving some spotty lacing. Strong raisin aroma, also vinous and fusel are present but mellow. Toasty dark belgian malt and faint Styrian hop scent with soft lactobacillus and fruity phenols in the background. The initial taste is of dark Munich and Aromatic malt, followed by a malt-driven raisin flavor. A solid caramel malt base and appropriate Styrian flavor and bitterness. The afteraste exhibits some medicinal phenols, a lambic-esque fruit character and slight vinous alcohol. This is very well balanced ale with plenty of complexity that represents the style well, as well as abbey beers in general. The medium body is well-attentuated but retains enough malt character so as to not be too dry. The medium cabonation is extra fine, adding a level of crispness without being overly fizzy. Finishes with lots of residual raisin and ripe fruit flavor, along with a boozey warming sensation but still holds a fair drinkability. The label says it was brewed and bottled in Belgium at the Duvel brewery, apparently to meet demand. With such high quality at the affordable price, its obvious why Ommegang is becoming so popular."
"Pours an opaque purple/brown with significant tan head and good lacing. Essences of blackberry/cherry. Taste is of a blackberry/plum with some light grains, and good forward hoppiness. Mouth feel is a good full one, very creamy with a little thickness to it.(A well crafted combination.) It finishes dry with some hints as to it's 8.5 ABV! I would certainly drink again."
"The taste was quite enjoyable nice rolling sweet malt flavors mixed with the light fruit. Mild hints of dried fruit and caramel. Nice chewy raisiny taste. Quite drinkable and very flavorful. Feels smooth and silky in the mouth. The malt flavor was balanced with a light dry finish. The fruity esters seem to cling to the pallet and allow for a nice mixing of the many flavors captured in this brew. They have created a well balance beer that has many complex features from the nose to the finish. The tangy flavors jump around the pallet. Well crafted beer and I certainly will try again."
"It has a nice strong, smooth taste. I'm new to Belgians so I don't know that many, but I know that I like this one and I often have one in my refridgerator."
"Again, most drinkable. Split a 750ml and wish I had more."
"Pours a burgundy brown color with thick sudsy two finger tan cap. Head falls into a one finger rocky top that hangs around for a while. Aroma has juicy raisins, honey, toasted caramel, biscuit, and slight earthiness. Flavor is toasted caramel sweetness, plums, earthy-nuttiness, Belgian yeast, slight sour apple and cherry, and acidity on back of tongue. Alcohol is noticeable. Coats the mouth at first with a medium body, but ends with a dry finish. Medium carbonation. Very drinkable, glad this one comes in a big bottle!"
"Overall a nice Dubbel ale that I would certainly entertain with again."
"Drinkability: Lovely, definately very drinkable, great flavor overtones really make this beer shine."
"M/D- Again bubbly and heavy...It seems to have a little More of a bite than other beers in this style that I have tried....I am really working on drinking more Belgian style ales to get my vocabulary and description up....I'm sure I'll get better as I drink more...overall a wonderful beer and very affordable."
"Dark brown almost completel opaque body with three fingers of head that slowly dissipates. Smells chocolatey with some fruit and alcohol notes. Tastes fruity, maybe of grape with a little citrus with more chocolate at the finish. Rather well-ballanced between the two. Alcohol, while present, is not very noticeable. On the higher end of medium-bodied, with a pleasant silky smooth texture. Definitely a sipper, but very enjoyable, especially for cold late fall and winter nights like tonight. The alcohol is so well-hidden, it creeps up on you. An excellent beer, and a steal at 5$ per 750ml bottle. Fantastic, worthwhile ale."
"D: Why does it have to end? To hell with it's 8.5% ABV, this is the kind of beer I would be satisfied to be stranded on an island with. I would drink a six of this all by myself, or empty a few 750's, casually and slowly, enjoying every drop. It's so damn tasty and so easy to drink. Few beers have been so pleasing."
"Decent-sized head, and a very dark brown color. Malty, spicy, ""Belgian"" aroma with some alcohol aroma too. Taste is malty, sweet and roasty. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, dry finish and a warming feel. A very tasty beer that is pretty drinkable, but has some strength at 8.5% ABV."
"Pours a deep, red mahogany in color with a nice off white head that settles down to just a coating but leaves some nice lacing on the glass. Smells of dark dried fruits (plums and cherries come to mind), a hint of yeast, and some dark, possibly toasted, malts. Not overpowering but overall very pleasant. Taste is of the dark fruits and caramel with some sweetnees and a mere hint of malts. The malt presence was, in my opinion, lacking. All of these flavors hit you upfront but disappear almost immediately. Good mouthfeel, carbonation is a little bit high, and is medium bodied. As for drinkanbility, could I have another? Sure, why not. The alcohol is very well masked and its an ok brew but really nothing special."
"A great ale. It can easily run with, and even pull to the front of, the Belgian pack from across the pond. Great malt complexity balanced by equally complex hop and spice additions. The alchol is well hidden. Definitely worth a try, if not regular rotation in your drinking regimen."
"D - Very good. This is pleasant in the mouth, but absolutely heaven in the nose. I would buy this again just to sniff it."
"I would drink this again in a New York Belgian brewery minute, and thoroughly enjoyed it with my meal and as itself."
"750ml caged corked bottle; poured into two medium sized snifters. Dark copper in color, as it settles, a more opaque red wine like appearance. Smell is massiveÂ—kiwi, rum soaked raisins, some caramel and toffee-ish notes and traces of alcohol. The initial sips are twangy, carbonated sweet malts. The body quickly reveals some syrupy and cotton candy tastes; dark chocolate cherries and tinges of alcohol are there. Easy to detect raisins, caramel malts and brown sugar round out the end. An American grown Belgian Strong Dark Ale? Available in my area? Say it ainÂ’t so? A liquid joy!"
"Pours a reddish brown with a finger of head. The foam falls quickly and leaves behind a ring of lace. The aroma is toffee and fruity esters/phenols. The flavor is fairly malty with the same caramel/toffee flavors. With 8.5% alcohol, it's a stong beer, but the body and flavors do a very good job at masking that strength. The body is great, heavy enough so you know it's there, but not so high as to make the beer overly sweet. It's quite a good beer."
"Mouthfeel is smooth, rich, mildly boozy, with a jumpy, caramel blast of richness in the full bodied brew. Doesn't get a whole lot better than this."
"Nice sour oak flavor, citrus fruits, yeasts, malts, alcohol, metallic flavors. Very complex. Good mouthfeel. Good drinkability."
"A solid Ommegang offering at a ridiculously low price. Not the biggest tasting Belgian ale but very drinkable and highly enjoyable."
"Bought surprisingly from local liquor store for $ 6.99, with out tax. Poured into my chalice a nice dark brown with some warm red highlights. First off I must mention that the head which was quite thick and pleasing, had a color of off white that had almost a neon green hint to it. When I look at the lacing on this beer I think of sea foam. The nose is of raisons, brown sugar, plum, dark cherries, some other dark fruity esters, a little hop funk and some minor yeasty bread notes. The flavor is much the same as the smell. Tastes a bit crisp, with some carbonation, there are some nice malt characteristics in this, but it is constantly fighting for supremacy with bitter Belgian (maybe saaz) hops, which is not bad at all, but could be better. I could denfinitly drink this beer, theres other BSDAs I like I think I like better, but this is damn nice. Try it,,,"
"Worth trying in the larger, corked bottle I think."
"Drinks very easy, not a bad take on the style & a best buy at $5.50 for 750ml@"
"This beer is quite fruity, and for those who don't mind a decent sugar content, I think very drinkable. A very solid overall ale."
"Beer poured out a beautiful dark mahoganey color, with a nice thick head that stuck around a while, and great lacing throughout. Smell was good, with nice malt scents, followed with some nice dark fruit aromas. Great tasting beer, many flavors coming through. Some nice roasted malt, as well as raisins, caramel, and a nice balanced bitterness. Mouthfeel was full, almost frothy, beer really comes to life in the mouth, top notch. Very drinkable, exceptional beer."
"Mouthfeel was somewhat thinner than expected, and a bit fizzy initially, yet still rich and creamy."
"750 ml caged /corked bottle. Says ""Brewed and bottled exceptionally in Belgium"" Nice yeasty, dark overripened fruity aromas, caramel fudge like aromas from the malts. Nice looking ale, handsome i would say, murky dense brown with a lovelly tight tan head. very rich deep malty/fruity taste, followed by a very noticable alcoholic strength spicy with some citric aftertaste. Tastes also of darker autumnal berries..even redcurrants come to mind. The palate was not the strongest part of this beer, though some may like the drying after glow, i did not, its my preference but i like a slightly more flavourful and Â’wet"" finish. Overall a good beer..i was going to say for an American Belgian style..but then its brewed in Belgium..whatever its a good beer and very good value at $4.50 a 750."
"An excellent representation of the style and tradition of Belgian brewing."
"Quite dissapointed with this stuff. All the flavors in this beer are pretty bland. The spice character is almost unpleasant, the malt presense is utterly weak, and the hops offer not much else. Worth a try, and I'll be trying another bottle in the near future, hoping that this was a bad bottle or something. Hennepin was such a fantastic saison that I guess I expected the same quality from Ommegang's strong dark ale."
"This beer poured a dark amber with a thick head. It smelled of dark roasted grains and yeasts. The taste is very dark and ""chewy"" it has a great feel in the mouth. It tastes like thick dark breads, My roommate compared it to a roast beef sandwich. I find this to be an excelent beer and will definatly go looking for it again."
"Devilly dilectable. It's so easy to drink. I enjoyed every sip. When the bottle was gone, I wanted one more drink."
"Overall a great Belgian Abbey - Another superior product from Upstate New York. I'm damn lucky to live here. God bless America."
"Â…and only $5.99 a bottle?!? EXCEPTIONAL value. Ommegang continues to be the best way to get into Belgium brews on a budget in the USA. But donÂ’t make the mistake of thinking that these beers are Â“cheapÂ”, for they are not. They are high quality brews sold at a very competitive price, and I continue to pick them up in preference to many so-called Belgium style beers brewed locally, often at half the quality of Ommegang, and sold at twice the price. This is still a benchmark beer. DonÂ’t let familiarity or your quest for new beers have you pass it over."
"The complexity compounds when it hits your tongue. Wow. The mouthfeel is awesome. Bubbly and light on the tongue, aromatic, bittersweet aftertaste. Warms you quickly. This is a well balanced beer that is a real treat to enjoy with a couple people. Not too expensive either. This is a great beer."
"Overall, a very good abbey ale. I will have this again."
"Pours a rich, almost garnet brownish red with a thick resilient head. A rich fruity aroma and a taste to match. Strong esters from warm fermentation shine through. The malt flavor almost tastes raw, as if the beer were brewed with antique equipment. You can taste every element of the beer, and it holds up sip after sip. Fantastic!"
"D- A, slow and steady sipper with a lot of nice qualities. I will only buy this in 750ml packaging because it seems just the right amount for my enjoyment ($4.99, can't beat that)."
"D- Strong brew, best to sip, many flavors to decifer."
"Drinkability: Definitely something to sip through a couple hours, as the alchohol is very up front in this brew."
"Poured a reddish brown color with a small off white head. It had a sweet aroma of fruit and caramel maltiness. Definite honey taste upfront, some sweetness, dark fruits turns alittle sour with a malty chewy mouthfeel. Slight alcohol burn on the way down."
"Drinkablity: After a few, itÂ’s a little much. ItÂ’s like eating too much pie. Enjoying every bite, but start to feel a little overwhelmed. Plus, with all of those bubbles carrying the 8.5% abv to your head, it might be wise to space these out."
"Drinkability and other notes: Not to crazy about this beer. Possibly I have a bottle that has seen better days."
"Beautiful, dark ruby/mahogany color body with a frothy tan head that settles down in fairly short order. The smell is sweet but sharp. Alcohol is in the nose, as is burnt caramel. Taste isn't as smooth as I'd hoped. It bites you back and has a certain astringency that I wasn't expecting. It's good, but could use a little more malty sweetness up front to balance things out. Mouthfeel is medium, creamy, with light carbonation."
"Pours a thick brown ale with a firm head that permiates roasted malts and caramel. Heavy carbonation and champagne like qualities run throughout.The nose is filled with nuts, berries and bannana. They reccomend drinking this at 50 degrees but this beers is awsome from start to finish. I insist on pairing this with a steak! A fabulous Belgian beer and would put this up with any European style. Another stellar beer from Ommegang and can't wait to see what they come up with next."
"Notes--One of my favorite Belgian style ales. I think it's right up there with the imported Belgian ales--but for a fraction of the price. I first had this one at a beer tasting put on my the Ommegang Brewery at the Pizza Plant in Buffalo, NY. This beer is becoming easier to find outside of New York. I've picked it up at a Kroger's in Raleigh, NC and at Total Wine in Jacksonville, FL. At around $4.00 for a 750 ml, I highly recommend this beer."
"750 ml poured into a gold rimmed OMMEGANG chalice. Initially a large wall of foam which lends way to very carbonated brew with little foam left rather quickly. Nice dark fig, plum and dark amber brown color. Tastes spicy and slightly fruity. Note nearly as complex as some true Belgian monastery ales but for about $4.50 at 750ml a treat for the price."
"This is a super sipper. Perhaps a good choice to bring to dinner when youÂ’re asked to bring wine."
"A wonderful beer to stock up on."
"D: A wonderful beer. Excellent flavors, warm and enchanting. A sipper - seems most appropriate with dessert, as a nightcap or a winter warmer. Definitely a ""must try""."
"This beer pours a rich mahogany color with a small but creamy tan head that fades to a thin cap. Aroma is very fruity, with notes of raisins and plums standing out the most, and a slight alcohol note in there as well. Taste is very complex, with sweet, toasty malts up front, followed by notes of caramel, and cocoa. Finish is somewhat dry, with a pleasant alcohol warmth that follows. Mouthfeel is creamy, and very smooth for a beer this big. As for drinkability, ABV means nothing in this case...this is great beer, and if you're lucky enough to have this available, drink up! Also, at the price you can get this one for ($5.99 for my 750ml bottle), you can't go wrong."
"Drinkability/Overall: A year and many hundred beers later, I can finally appreciate all this beer has to offer. Just a ridiculous amount of flavor development for one beer, and balanced well to boot. A steal at twice the price, the pinnacle of American Belgian-Style brewing (granted this was actually brewed in Belgium)."
"A full bodied brew, it came across like a sour Champaign."
"Drinkability: Awesome, complex and strong without being overpowering. Great development keeps you guessing, while the deftness of the brew leaves it well within its style. And at the price, this is a steal."
"Poured from a 22 ounce bomber to a amber brown color with a thick tan head and great lacing. The aroma was that of malt and nut early, but as the glass watrmed, the aroma became more dark fruit and a more noticeable alcohol. I was not impressed with the finish at first, in that it was slightly watery. However, as beer warmed at mid-glass, palte was much more full and smooth, and the alcohol gave a warming sensation on the way down."
"I'd feel this were a lot more drinkable if the carbonation was less intense. Otherwise a well balanced beer."
"This brew pours a murky dark brown color. The head is one finger in height, creamy, and long lasting. The aroma of caramel, pepper, and other spices. The taste has a bit more caramel than other Belgain strong darks I have had. The caramel seems to dominate the spices, although there are some nice yeast tones in the aftertaste. The mouthfeel is full bodied with low carbonation. Overall, this isn't the best Belgain strong dark I have had, but it is thoroughly enjoyable."
"3-Jan-06, Bottle [Brewed by Duvel-Moortgat], 4.0, 4.0, 4.5, 4.5, 4.5, 4.30"
"Poured a dark copper with ruby hues. Tremendous thick and creamy head that stays throughout the entire session. Absolutely beautiful looking beer. Smelled of dark fruit ie figs, raisins, etc, maybe some yeast, a tad of bananas, mediciny too. Also tasted of the dark fruits along with hints of toffee and slight yeast. Taste ends off with a burgundy wine tasting alcohol warming. Mouthfeel was medium bodied, creamy, extremely bubbly like champagne at first but dies down after 10 minutes or so. Fairly drinkable but could be better. I was expecting more from this beer actually. I feel that this beer would be IMMENSELY better after aging maybe a year or so. Im gonna have to buy a few bottles and approach that idea."
"Very excellent and highly worth checking out!"
"It looks dark brown at first glance, but really it's closer to a deep ruby. It poured with a generous, light brown head that left behind considerable creamy lacing as it fell. Aromas of sweet, dried fruits (raisins, prunes) as well as fresh plums, with a hints of dark, nutty malts, bready yeast, and spicy alcohol. Wow, nice complexity while keeping everything balanced. Plenty of malty, fruity sweetness to start followed by notes of plums, slight bitterness, and licorice. There's also a bit of clove just before the alcohol warmth kicks in at the finish. Dry on the palate, medium/full bodied, with fine carbonation. Creamy, mellow texture. This is quality beer - I thoroughly enjoyed it and had no problem finishing off the 750mL myself over the course of a couple hours."
"D - The complexity of this beer was lost somewhere. Instead of my palatte not knowing what wonderful taste to concentrate on, I found myself just trying not to taste the sharp alcohol. Not a bad beer, but not the best. I expected more from Ommegang, so I plan on grabbing another of these bottles and reviewing again..."
"Drinkability - this is very good, goes down well, but it is more of a sipping brew, and would seem to require drinking with a meal, and also the high abv limits it to one per session"
"Poured into a Chimay goblet, a gorgeous ruby color when held up to the light, with a creamy tan head that lingers for a while and leaves a nice fine lace on the glass. The smell has notes of fruit and chocolate along with noticable alcohol. Also a slight metallic smell that fades away. Nice and sweet, with plum and caramel flavors with a hint of hops and alcohol. Velvety and rich with just enough carbonation making this beer impressive and enjoyable to drink. A world class beer from a US brewery having their Belgian style ale brewed in Belgium by a world class brewery. Go figure."
"Pours a dark, garnet color with just a modest head for a belgian. Smell is very sweet and fruity--smells somehow of yogurt-covered raisins. Flavor is good but comes off immediately as somewhat medicinal. Nevertheless it still has that fabulous, proof-that-god-loves-me strong belgian dark ale flavor. There are chocolate notes, as well as the follow up rememberances of the yogurt-covered raisins. It's alright--I would choose others first. Judged against others of its style."
"Truly an American craft beer classic!"
"This beer left me with quiet an impression. Very dark amber pour with nice creamy white head- looks like a serious beer. Smell is stong, reminds me of sweet dried fruit, Taste is great, again strong malt presence with a raisin like aftertaste. It has a smoothness, but never loses it's edge. It seems the more sips you take, the stronger the beer becomes. A big brew for me, can't really drink too much of it, but I certainly appreciate how well made it is."
"I have to say, good as this beer is, I expected a little more complexity, more layers."
"Good beer, complex and interesting. Not my favorite Ommegang (that honor goes to Hennepin), but still enjoyable."
" This one had a rather large hop bitterness which I thought was a bit too much, otherwise...really nice."
"Poured from a corked and caged 750 ml bottle. This beer had a dark, reddish brown appearance with a large 1 inch light tan head. There was a good bit of carbonation. Aroma was malty and caramelly with some hop aroma in the backround. Taste was of malt, dark fruits, maple syrup and a fruitiness that reminded me of caramel covered apples. This beer was medium bodied and fairly easy to drink considering the 8.5% abv. Not bad for the price either."
"poured a rich ruby color big light tan head some lacing. aroma sweet carmel honey, malts,raisins, another one that was hard to keep my nose away from the glass.flavor dark fruits,alcohol,honey malts,as it warmed up stared to get a semi sweet red wine like quality .liked the finish on this just the right amount of sweetness and bitterness that lasted just right"
"Lively carbonation helps it slide right down the throat and leaves a lingering bitterness in the mouth. A great example of an American Belgian. It doesn't quite replace Chimay in my top slot, but it's a good affordable amd delightful brew."
"I had a hard time taking more than one glass due to the tart and bitter alcohol at the forefront. Both warm and cold, it's hard to focus on the real flavours underneath."
"T/MF/D: Everything that makes the regular abbey great is there, but better. Medium bodied, but rich, with burnt, ripe fruits which give a toasty sweetness. Caramel and alittle spice(cloves?) is in there too. Slight, warming alcohol kick. This is a mellowed beer with any rough edges from the original smoothed out. More drinkable than the regular abbey. Not too cloying, substantial carbonation, but it doesnt get in the way. In fact it helps leave a sharp and satisfying conclusion to a great beer."
"Did I say smokey? Yes...not in the way of a smoked beer, but a nice mellow smoked toastiness to the sweet malt that keeps it from becoming cloying."
"The flavor is quite darker than I expected. Extremely smooth and slightly smokey. Figs and a woody smoked tone make the flavor deep and rich. Finish is dry and smokey. Alcohol is virtually undetectable considering it weighs in at 8.5%."
"I came back to it after a few minutes and it didn't strike me as improved with time or air. I would like to revisit this ale either on tap or with a fat roast beef sandwhich this Fall, as the winter will be approaching once again."
"Pours a muddy reddish brown with a smooth tan head that lasted. Strong and warming with the promised burgundy notes, with cherry, caramel, and an evident breadiness. The taste showed complexity as it warmed and tasted more wine-like. The alcohol was evident as well, though I was tempted to have a second. I drank it with a medium-rare rib steak, which was a very nice pairing. Would love to try again soon, preferable with another steak."
"Pours dark caramel with moderate carbonation and an impressive, rocky, buttermilk head. Suprisingly weak on the nose, but with spicy hints of cinammon and caramel malt. Pretty mild for what IÂ’ve come to expect from a Belgian. Medium heavy body, lightly carbonated, not a lot of kick going down. Hopped spices and vague fruitiness with a faint hint of alcohol to finish it off. Really pretty underwhelming for what I expect out of a Belgian. Maybe IÂ’ve just had too many sterling examples recently to be impressed by something thatÂ’s ""only"" Chimay caliber. Scored higher overall due to greater drinkability at this price, which can be fully half what youÂ’d pay for the average Belgian import"
"Pours very dark with a big, foamy tan head. Holding it up to the light reveals a deep burgundy color. The head dissipates slightly but retains a thin lacing right through the finish. Smell is sweet and fruity, and the taste is the same. Very smooth and balanced, the taste shields the 8.5 ABV, which you don't much feel until polishing off the first half of the 750ml bottle and standing up to get the second half. I prefer the taste as it begins to warm, when the malty flavors really come out and a bit of a bite that is evident when too cold really smooths out. Quality brew that makes a nice treat."
"This is a dark, dark beer. Rich, fruity, complex, and just really ""full"" all around. Oh yeah...this is quality stuff right here."
"This is a good beer- complex and enjoyable for sure- but there is also something too methodical about it. It could achieve greatness with more of a wild side."
"Pours a lovely mahogany -crystal clear and brown-red with a slight fluffy khaki head. The aroma is dark and caramelly, with notes of sweet malt and raisins. Taste is complex and totally delicious: rich, but not heavy, full of dark fruits, a hint of hops, and a round spicy finish. Mouthfeel is fizzy and light, with a little bit of heat. Excellent!"
"Notes: Overall when you consider price per quality this is just average. This is my favorite style and to be honest this comes up short."
"Ommegang Abbey Ale pours a deep copper color with a tan head from a brown twelve ounce bottle. Aroma is fruity, when it warms, it is more malty, with caramel being evident. Taste is in turns fruity, malty/caramel and maybe a bit of sour apple. It's also a bit peppery in the finish. Although the alcohol isn't overpowering it is noticeable to me. Doesn't knock my socks completely off, but its a pretty darn good beer. Definitely worth a try."
"Drinkability? I buy a lot of beer and this one is probably top of my list. I love this beer."
"All in all...I would buy it again, perhaps in the availible 750ml corked bottle. I will also be trying Ommegang's other offerings."
"This is a very nice and complex brew. I definitely recommend it."
"Drinkability: It tastes great, so that wouldn't be a barrier to my consuming this in mass quantities. It's the alcohol content that would be the limiting factor. A session with this would probably be a bad idea."
"ommegang abbey is one of my favorites, great beer, awesome flavor."
"This beer is certainly a contender among any authentic Belgian beer, and, for us Americans, as a very reasonable price tag."
"Way too drinkable! So smooooth and easy."
"Overall, a phenomenal-looking, good tasting brew. Another example of well-crafted Belgian style beer made in North America."
"If you're feeling bold and adventurous (or just happen to like very sweet, fruity, dark Belgian ales), give it a go!"
"Had this at the Blind Tiger. This is delicious on tap, absolutely delicious. The flavor is deeper, richer, meatier. Complex coffee flavors, dark fruits, bitter espresso- just delicious. Chewy and creamy, and a sneaky eight and a half percent. More people need to get this on tap- asap."
"Verdict: This one takes the strong dark ale style and knocks it out of the park. Subtle and nuanced, yet still pleasantly rough-around-the-edges. Truly world class."
"Drinkability- This is actually one of the most drinkable belgian strong ales I've had... The label says not to disturb the yeast at the bottom of the bottle, but I found that I prefer it with. It actually somehow manages to mellow out the beer a bit. Pretty interesting brew."
"This is a nice beer. It's a dark brown color with a small head and some lacing. It has a sweet, fruity odor, as well as some malt. The taste is great. A sweet fruit(plum/raisin/citrus) with some caramel and hops in there too. It was just a tiny bit too carbonated for me, but overall a very nice, drinkable beer."
"This tastes more like a dubbel than a dark ale, and is one of the tastier ones I've had. Plum, cherry, and even notes of fig are present. Smell does not conceal the alcohol at all, plenty of phenols here. There is a slight grassy taste to it, similar to a saison, that seems to be a typical feature of many dubbels. Could be the hops, but I'm not positive. Overall, I'd say this is an above average Belgian style, better than many actual Belgians I've had. This is def a good deal at $5.69. Will I drink it again? Definitely. Will I seek it out? Probably not too often. All in all, recommended. It may be just what you're looking for, and is definitely worth a try."
"Pours out a cloudy, copper color with a large head. Great lacing, too. You can smell the hops and spices instantly. The hop and spice taste is apparent at first sip. It also has a slight bitter kick to it, as well. It has a smooth mouthfeel. It is very drinkable, but due to the high abv I would only have one. Great ""American"" Belgium brew."
"-SS"
" Another strong offering from the boys at Ommegang. Not as good as Heneppin but better than Rare Vos in my pecking order."
"Delicious. Good size brownish red head that that lasts long and even tastes great. Once you get to the dark amber liquid though, itÂ’s a real treat. Taste of cherries was most prominent for me, but not overpowering. I did note the chocolate and caramel too. A little too robust to drink a bunch at a time, you want to savor it like a fine wine."
"After fighting with the cork for a while- Pours a flakey bronze into a stemmed tulip glass. Small bubbles of carbonation make up the great tan head. Very aromatic musty oak and flowery with hints of caramel. Tastes of sweet caramel and fruit dance on the tongue while the slight alcohol burn is surprising for only being 8%. Higher in alcohol percent and mouthfeel, but still a very drinkable beer."
"another fine product from Ommegang, i like Hennepin better, but this is also good"
"Poured to celebrate my acceptance into an MFA program I was hoping to get into and a wonderful celebratory beer this is!"
"I have had my eye on this beer in particular for several months now. I finally ran across it again and couldn't help but get a couple bottles. This is a heavily carbonated beer so the cork goes flying when you pop it. The best thing about this beer is its aroma. I used a tulip glass, which supported a healthy head throughout the whole experience. The color was a nice brown with a tint of red. It was alittle cloudy due to the fact that this is a bottle conditioned beer. This beer has a great taste to it too. The malt is obviously the center of attention, but there is still a good hoppy flavor in it. Overall this is an amazing beer for ale lovers."
"Taste is piney, malty with a shy hoppy balanced note that comes with alcohol flavors and end with some cherry feels."
"D - Solid brew but a little too heavy on the carbonation for my liking."
"A special occasion beer if I've ever had. It is meanty to be enjoyed slowly and that's what I did. The booze and the flavor keep me from slamming it, so that's a good thing."
"Good full body, tons of flavor and plenty of alcohol give an exquisite mouthfeel that makes the tastebuds sing as you swallow. Makes you want more, but this one is a sipper, not a sessioner...no doubt !"
"Poured from a 750ml bottle into a Gulden Draak Chalice. Beer presents itself as a dark burgundy color that is slightly cloudy. Thick, coffee-foam colored head with good retention and delicate lacing inside the glass. Nose is malty, spicy, and nutty. Sweet mollasses-like malts are predominant, with mulled cider-esqe spices. After the initial alcohol burn and malt sweetness, you can detect the nutty taste as well. This is a medium-heavy bodied dubbel with high carbonation and noticable alcohol content. A good example of the style from this American brewery. Sweet and very warm, not overly spiced or cloying though. Well crafted. I'm looking forward to trying this one after having been cellared a year or two."
"A great brew, one that's becoming more prevalent in these handy-dandy 12oz. bottles."
"Overall: I absolutely love this beer. It's a nice balance of sweet, spicy and bitter."
"I recently toured the brewery, and they described that anise is used to flavor this beer. Now it's easier to pick out that flavor."
"Notes: Hoping this is a bad bottle. Will try/review again."
"I prefer the other Ommegang offerings, but as with the others, a good value at 5 bucks a 750ml if you're looking for something rich and different on a budget."
"Served from a 12 oz bottle into an Ommegang glass. The beer poured a dark brown/amber color with a thick tan head with nice lacing. The aroma is a deep caramel and malt bomb that is really enjoyable. You gets hints of the high ABV but it is masked pretty well in this. The taste is more of the malt and caramel from the smell and with some good carbonation to balance it out. The beer gives you a good aftertaste and I find it fairly drinkable, even for 8.5%."
"Pours carmely brown into the glass. Inch or so of foam and nice lacing down the inside of the glass. Sweet carmel and raisin aromas. Nice creamy mouthfeel. Taste is as I suspected. Raisin, licorice, and maybe a little nutty. Very very nice. I could get in trouble with this beer. Definitley recommended."
"Figured id give the version brewed in belgium a go: Pours a brillant crimson amber hue with a thick, frothy tan head that retains well. The aroma has big dark fruits (plum, cherry, grape and fig), candied sugar, belgian yeast, spice (corriander, clove, pepper), and a slight alcohol presence. The flavor starts out with some dark fruits (cherry, grape, plum, strawberry), some spices (corriander, clove, pepper), dark candy sugar, slightly funky belgian yeast, minmal floral and herbal hops and a touch of alcohol. The mouthfeel is full and rich and the carbonation is on the light side but appropriate, and drinkability is good. An excellent dubbel (i dont care what BA says), complex and dare i say better (than the one brewed in cooperstown), also an incredible value."
"Musings: At 5.99 a bottle - it is virtually impossible to best this. Even then, I will drink this over Allagash and put alongside Unibroue. I am not a huge fan of the other Ommegang brews, but this is a winner."
"Pleasant mouthfeel with a great carbonated feel and a smooth body. Body is medium heavy. Alcohol resides in the afterataste. Warming and pleasant on a cool Super Bowl Sunday in the south. Five more hours until kickoff!"
"If poured like the bottle says you get a good inch or so thick head that lingers around for a minute or two and falls back on itself into a dense top layer. The beer is a redish brown. Smells of cherries and raisins with some flowery sweetness. Tastes like fresh cherries and raisins, crisp sweetness up front with lots of yeast and a yeast/bread/malt finish. Feels like you just got done chewing through some fresh bread. A very good beer to say the least. Lots of flavors that blend well. The beer could have a little bit less yeast but other than that, nothing bad at all about this brew. I could drink this all night as long as I watched myself. I'm feeling a buzz after downing this first bottle. Now I look forward to the white of the same brand that's sitting in the fridge!"
"Served from a 750ml bottle into a stein (I know I should be using a goblet), it's a good looking beer, a nice rich brown, with a considerable (1""+) light brown, not quite tan head. Plenty of carbonation. The smell is nice, definite fruit prescence. Taste is where it all goes wrong. It's very yeasty and a bit nutty. If there was fruit in there, the yeast overwhelmed it. I couldn't even taste any malt or hops. Mouthfeel was smooth enough but I couldn't make detailed observations as the yeast taste was rather unpleasant. Maybe I got a bad bottle, or maybe this is the style of Belgian ales. I'm not familiar with Belgian style, so I couldn't say. I've got Chimay Red for the Super Bowl and hopefully it will be better than this, which I entirely disliked. Needless to say, I didn't finish the bottle."
"Drinkability: extremely enjoyable and flavorful beer that should be on everyone's regular rotation of Belgian-style ales. Easy to drink more than one bottle in an evening."
"Very enjoyable brew."
"Uncorked a chilled 1/5 bottle (750 ml), aroma in the bottle is molasses, cherry and raisons. Poured it into a goblet glass, nice tan head great lacing very deep copper color. Wafting the glass produces a sweet yet very tangy smell that dislays the high AC of this beverage. The carbonation is excellent. The taste is sweet yet sour, cherry accented by lemon. The mouthful is explosion of flavors and carbonation. The finish is sweet yet tangy. A delicious and very robust selection. A bottle of this and let the good times roll. I definitley will be restocking this brew."
"This beer emerged out of a twelve ounce bottle with a dark brown colour and some crimson tint where the light struck the edges of the glass. A giganstrosity of a tan head volcanoed up half the glass requiring a wait in finishing the fill. The nose was layered with some bizarre perfumed flowery scent that struck me at the onset of sniffing. After this oddity was nosed, scents of heavily candied dark fruit and caramel followed on its heels. Plum and black cherry notes came to mind. The nose was surprisingly light on yeasty character, although some was present within the quite pronounced and rather complex mix of sugary fruitiness. The taste held a sweet aspect at the front end that later tailed into some dark fruit skin like dryness from the hopping. It is always interesting to taste beers like these. So much to consider and revel in. The tones remind me of light caramel and old super ripe plum. A lingering rind quality in the finish keeps the dark fruit flavour alive as the tongue is dried out. This tastes of richness and maturity. In terms of the fruitiness that is. Mouthfeel is a light medium. Speedy and small are the bubbles that contribute to this lightness. The drinkability is good. Plenty of pondering can be had through the course of one glass, though not enough. The earth may not shatter, but there are certainly good tastes and food for thought here."
"Colour is dark reddish brown or plum. Has a nice one-inch head that retains itself well. Aromas of rasins, bananas, and Belgian yeasts are present. Sweet, and mildly alcoholic. The first taste begins fruity and becomes sweet after a few seconds. The sweet malt flavors then seem to evaporate into a dry and spicy alcoholic finish. The first few sips were excellent but over time the spicy/alcoholic character begins to overpower the complex malt flavors making it harder to distinguish. The mouthfeel is nice, with medium thickness and robust carbonation. I like the beer but the drinkablity seems to decrease for me as I go along..."
"Supper dark red/brown color with a tan head. Smell is dark fruit, plum, cherries, dates. Also a slight musty yeasty smell. Taste is full of fruity flavor and heavy dark malt. Moutfeel may be the best part of this beer. Very creamy full mouth with a nice carbonation level. Active on the tongue. The best American belgian style beer I've had. This is one I will return to over and over."
"This is an interesting beer. I'm still getting acquainted to Belgian style beers so I don't think I'm able to fully appreciate this yet. Now I want to find out what an authentic Belgian version tastes like."
"D - Pretty good considering the mouthfeel. This is a pleasant drink although I'd call it a dessert beer for sure. I really enjoyed it even though it tastes strongly of alcohol and has a bit of an odd mouthfeel."
"Poured a rich deep crimson ale with an off white rocky, head that left ample lace and stayed around for a long time. The aroma is rich with dark caramel maltyness and hints of dark fruit like figs. The flavor is excellent and has become my personal favorite abbey dubbel as it begins with an effervescent rush of sweet malt and perfectly balanced dark fruit which slowly fades leaving a dry and clean finish which becons the drinker to partake of another sip. The body is perfect for an abbey dubbel and it is both full of carbonation and has a nice weight when held on the tongue yet has a very clean finish. This ale is very drinkable and i will probably buy a few bottles to lay down and see what an aged example tastes like."
"Finished the 750ml bottle without much trouble. Very drinkable for an 8% beer. A fine American Belgian Style Ale, and a bargain at $5 a bottle!"
"Not a bad ale. Great bargain compared to Chimay. I don't think I could drink a lot of these in a row, however."
"The physical characteristics of this beer are well documented in other reviews, so I will merely record that this is a great beer and while I can't rule out the possibility that there will be those who don't like it, I think that for the vast majority this will prove to be a repeat purchase item. Quality, Value, Convenience (what?). It's quite strong too...."
"Overall this is a decent beer that I am enjoying, but isn't a classic that makes me want to come back for more."
"Poured out of the 750ml caged and corked bottle into an Orval chalice, gorgeous brew... pours a bloodshot brown with creamy lingering lacework after the luxurious head, so appetizing. Nose is fruity and sweet, sugar isn't hidden at all, also notes of cherries, bananas, and a bit of alcohol. Taste is dominated by fruit with red wine-like grape notes followed by yeasty twang and a bit of alcohol...unfortunately the mouthfeel here isn't quite right which I think detracts from the complexity of the taste. A bit too light and watery keeps the taste from lingering long after the swallow, the only real flaw with this brew. A very nice and affordable Belgian, like others have said i'll try and get my mitts on some domestically brewed versions and see if the texture problem is worked out."
"Ommegang is one of those beers that I can easily find locally and thank god it is, wonderful stuff. Pours a dark brown/orange color, with a head that lasts for quite a while. Tastes very nice, spices, dried fruit (apricot?) caramel, a bit of alcohol bite. Mouthfeel is very nice and finishes off easy. Definetly a fan favorite."
"*Update* (15 minutes later) man, this beer just gets worse as I drink it, and it warms. Sickly, sticky sweet... not sure if I'll finish this one, and I never throw beer out (unless it's spoiled). Also no sign of head now, and zero lacing, just looks like a flat brown unappealing liquid."
"Drinkability: This one is quite drinkable! The sweetness was very subdued and made this a refreshing ale."
"On a side note, maybe it's time for Ommegang to start bottling some Wild Ale!"
"I don't know what it is, but when I naively say, ""I don't like Belgian beers", I mean, I don't like this particular caramel flavour. It just dominates some belgian style beers and when it is there, I am just not going to enjoy the brew. It's not in all dark ales, so I'm not sure what it is. Candi sugar maybe? That'd be my guess. Nasty stuff that."
"750 mL, corked and caged. Not just a ""Belgian-style"" abbey ale, as this batch was ""Brewed and bottled exceptionally in Belgium"" for Ommegang by their buddies at Duvel Moortgat. Pours a clear, deep reddish brown with a fluffy light tan head, quite imposing. The nose is sweet, boozy berries and dried fruits smothered in vanilla with undercurrents of anise. The taste is dry, vinous, and fruity -- prunes, raisins, mashed banana. There's a bit of cloying sweetness at the finish with a dry and somewhat sour aftertaste, sort of like an overripe orange. Creamy mouthfeel, but a bit on the thin side, surprisingly. Also quite a lot of peppery carbonation in the mouth. Highly drinkable as the 8.5 % abv is hardly noticeable. This is a little thinner, and also a bit less complex than I remember the domestically produced stuff I had several times over the last year. That one would have rated all 5's possibly. This Belgian take on an American interpretation of a Belgian style (?...) is still world class, but the Cooperstown-brewed ale (still available in 12oz. bottles) is downright sublime."
"Drinkability: This beer is highly acclaimed, and yet I was not very impressed by it. Perhaps it was a bad bottle, but it just seemed too sweet and carbonated to rate very high. It is drinkable and reasonably priced, but I personally much prefer true Belgian brews like Corsendonk and Chimay."
"1/29/06 Today I had the good fortune to drink a Ommegang Abbey ale that was cave aged from March 4, 2004 through September 30th 2004. The beer was everything I said it was above; however, I think the beer is even smoother at this time. I dont know if cave aging is just a gimmick but I liked it."
"Hmmm....this one is an interesting ale. Not expecting anything at all, I pour from the 750ml bottle and a absolutely gorgeous, deep, red translucent color appears with a remarkable thick, chunky, beige head appears. So far so good, I was very impressed. Then the sweet fruity aroma filled the air and I caught hints of apples and plums, very, very nice. So, naturally at this point I was expecting an outstanding flavor. However, I found a flavor that didn't instantly blow me away. It was nice, good fruitiness, nice hops and malts and a noticable alcohol hit on the back end. Still, overall, it is a good Belgian that I would recommend, but probably would buy others first."
"Very nice example of the style, and at an extremely reasonable price."
"This is one of my top 3 Belgian Strong Darks. Plums and roasty malts dominate the beer. Exceptional smell and head which remains the whole way down the glass. Tough to put this one down before it puts you down!! The Belgian Candi is present with yeasty glows. Awesome beer and awesome price. I wish I could find this in a six pack. If you want to get started with Belgians, this is the one to try."
"Notes: I will try this again in the future to just get a handle on the style."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Creamy. Perfect. The flavors in the beer are emphasized by the most delicate and subdued carbonation possible, resulting in an experience almost too good to be true. Paired with a fantastic sirloin, this killed. Alone afterwards, I write this review with just a swallow left in my glass."
"Cheers!"
"This is a great sipping beer. Another tremendous beer from ommegang."
"Overall- not very pleased witht this fruity burning mess. I was able to drink but will not purchase again."
"D- Very nice brew! Good flavor, lots of it to drink in a 750ml bottle! Yummy!!!"
"A highly drinkable beer. Careful with the 8.5 % abv."
"Drinkability: A hugely complex and impressive brew, especially by a domestic brewer of Belgians (Allagash also being on of the more impressive domestic Belgian breweries). I think it holds up to many imports, and it's a great version of the style to start with for price and availability. I'll certainly be buying more."
"Pours form 750ml bottle into 24 oz glass. Nice pour strong 3 finger head that settles to 1/2 finger holding steady. A nice lace follows the drink down the glass. The smell is full and sweet, like fruit sugars from raisens or plums, a nice bold toasty malt with a slight grain presence in the back very deep smell every waft brought out something new, cocoa and brown sugar, ginger very complex, just great...the best smelling brew I have ever had the pleasure to drink. The taste is just as pleasing a nice malty front sugary and just great. A full presence from front to back, sweet, then tangy with a tint of sourness, the plum sweetness is back in the taste with a nice hop follower. I really enjoyed this one. The abv shows up more and more as the beer warms from a 45 deg storage temp. That really makes the beer. A creamy full and smooth mouthfeel that is carbonated just right tingling my cheeks and tongue. If you have not had this one go get it ASAP. This is a great brew...I am amazed."
"Insanely easy to drink. The ABV will keep me in check if I try for too many at one sitting...."
"Very drinkable. I like this more after a year and a half in the cellar."
"Served from a 750ml bottle into a goblet. Poured a dark bronze color with a mocha colored head. Not much smell to detect Â– perhaps some hints of alcohol. Fabulous taste with a complexity of fruit and berry flavors. Alcohol was present, as one would expect from an 8.5% abv ale, but it was not not overwhelming. Mouthfeel was slightly carbonated with woody overtones. Easily drinkable, though not on par with some of the Unibroue Â“BelgianÂ” offerings."
"The taste was less complex than I thought it would be with a good dose of plum notes and some malt but not much else. Still, all in all, I liked it and would drink it again."
"Drinkability: An excellent affordable Belgian Style Ale that was brewed in the good old U.S. of A. Although at 8.5% this is a beer where you can drink the whole 750ml by yourself."
"Nice offering from Ommegang. For the price, it's one of the best out there in my opinion. It gets more complex as you go through it and it goes down easy. Definitely worth a try if available in your area."
"Pours a dark purple in my goblet with a creamy & thick head. The head dissipates quickly and leaves behind some lacing. Aromas of sherry, berries, dark fruit, and roasted malts are apparent. The taste is of sharp malt with a fruity backbone. Some fruity bitterness and sweetness come out nicely as the beer warms, followed by a distinct alcohol taste. This beer is rich and sweet with great oak-like depth just like port or aged merlot. A truly exceptional taste, but one that is strong and in my opinion, acquired. I could have a few of these, it is that good."
"This ale is rather carbonated, much to my surprise. On my initial pour I got at least two inches of head. The initial smell is reminiscent of burgundy and tobacco. When rolling onto your tongue, the sharp bite of the alcohol hits immediately and then relaxes into a traditional malty-sweet ""dubbel"" taste that evaporates quickly. While sipping this ale, notice the wonderful off-white think lace that appears on the glass almost like a cobweb. At 8.5% you must be careful with this brew, as it is extremely easy to drink, especially with a cigar; highly recommended for the price."
"Overall:"
"The body is medium to full. Limited carbonation. Overall a good Abbey ale. A stronger malty then a average Abbey. Also the yeast is a more subtle. Well, my suggest is you should try this."
"Stunning."
"cheers..."
"A damn fine brew. A deep red marron with a frothy head that holds on for all its worth. The nose is large complex sugars of malt and fruitiness of apples and plum with yeast phenols. The taste melts in my mouth giving it a pleasent rich glow of of fully develop caramel malt mixed slightly with a appley-plum thing maybe some cherry tartness at the end, but the yeast flavoring gives the beer the intangable and with its smooth silk texture I will be seeing this in a glass near me soon."
"This is an exceedingly smooth, drinkable beer. The aroma is faint, but fruity. It has a deep rich color and foamy head thick enough to cling to the sides of the glass, though not so frothy as some other Belgian-style beers. There is some lingering tartness (think cherries), but no bitter aftertaste."
"Ommegang's bottle describes its color as ""burgundian;"" I'm not sure why the brewery chose that word, which implies ""of Burgundy (the region)"" rather than burgundy the color. While the former does not apply, the latter certainly does, as Ommegang is a wine-like deep red color. It's capped by a yellowish head with good retention. The smell is of dark fruits, especially tart cherries, and not much else. A little too heavy on the cherries, I think. The taste is similar, but a touch better due to the good toasted finish. The mouthfeel is quality, but that can't save Ommegang from being one-dimensional."
"Palate- A big palate indeed. Molasses, apples, caramel, cloves, pepper, and a bit of alcohol all blend nicely together to make quite a satisfying, intoxicating and not-too-expensive beer. This will go well with a blaze in the fireplace this winter."
"Great beer. Retired? Say it isn't so."
"I wonder if the complexity and flavors of this cave aged Ommegang could be replicated in my cellar. I'll let you know in a couple of years. The only bad thing I can say about this beer is that the next bottle of Ommegang I buy won't be getting uncorked for a long, long time. I would highly reccomend either trying this one, or laying down a bottle of Ommegang for a while."
"Well. This is my first beer from Ommegang and sure not to be my last. This beer appears a nice reddish brown with a thick bubbly head. The head does disappear but will lace the glass throughout the life of the beer. The smell is of alcohol cherries, bananas perhaps and malt. The taste is of fruit, a hint of cherries and warms up with the taste of alcohol. The mouthfeel is thin and warm light carbonation. This is a good beer not yet highly drinkable the alcohol really comes though in this one. Nice Brew."
"Well i would have to say the label is pretty accurate in describing its but i will continue nevertheless. This pours with a full, gorgeous and forever rising brown head. The dome is perfect and round and i swear as you keep on drinking it it keeps on rising right to the top. The body is a hazy as hell burgundy with carbonation that never ends and rising in horizontal sheets off the side of the glass. Nice lacing. Perfect appearance. The aroma is a interesting combination of alcohol, chocolate, malt, banana, flowers and nuts. The taste is so full and rich. It is intense also as the alcohol kicksyou in the ass. Present are hops, maltiness and finally i picked up the clove which came on strong when it did. I will have to rank this slightly below the 3 philosophers and rare vos beacuse i find those to be near perfect brews and this isn't quite as pleasant due to the alcohol. I don't think it si covered up as well here. The mouthfeel is nice and creamy. Drinkability is moderate."
"This is a definite sipping beer."
"I think this is a very drinkable beer and recommend it."
"This is my third beer from Ommegang, and they are quickly becoming one of my favorite breweries."
"Despite its relative strength (8.5%), and bold flavors, Ommegang is not intimidating like most other Belgians. ItÂ’s incredibly smooth and cohesive putting its drinkability right through the roof. Anyone who can enjoy a middle of the road ale like New Castle should be able to tolerate and eventually learn to love not only the Ommegang but other strong Belgians as well. For the seasoned beer drinker, OmmegangÂ’s appeal will be immediate."
"12 oz. bottle with no freshness date but I know it's a good six months old. Served slightly chilled in a Chimay chalice. It pours a murky brownish-red with a 1/2"" yellow/tan head that leaves lots of lacing. Smells of blackberries, raisins, yeast, alcohol, and perhaps bananas and apples - very sweet and fruity. The taste isn't as complex, with notes of raisins, yeast, alcohol, and lots of sweetness. The body is full and has very smooth carbonation. I'm a little let down by this bottle - I remember it tasting better than this. I'll re-review with a better bottle sometime."
"Overall, Ommegang Abbey Ale is an excellent beer. As I've mentioned above, this beer from the first time I tasted it, has represented quality and what others should strive for in their brewing process. Today, many years after first sampling it, and having tried hundreds of other beers in between, I can say with no reservations that considering all things (price, quality, enjoyment level etc..) this is one of my favorite beers and will continue to be a standby for as long as it''s brewed."
"This beer pours a cloudybrown. The head is thick and brown. It fades slowly, leaving very thick laces. I had a little trouble at first placing the aroma, but then I read karst's review, and I agree, it has a bubblegum aroma. I dont think I have ever noticed a beer with an aroma of bubblegum before. It also smells fruity. It has a banana aroma. Not much for hops. The malt aroma is also lacking. The main thing I smell is bubblegum. It has a strange taste. It tastes bubblegum like, with a fruity kick to it. I dont know if I like it too much. I think it has a slight medicine like flavor. I dont know what else to say about the flavor. I know this beer is ranked quite highly, but I just dont like it much. It leaves a medicine like aftertaste. I will probably never drink this beer again."
"Shared this bottle with friends celebrating the birth of their first son - Quinn."
"overall: very good beer! tastes amazing. i'm going out to buy 2 more to cellar for a year and two. excellent ""celebration"" brew."
"Very rich and smooth. Aged well. Gotta go dig myself a 156 foot cave now. However, something was growing on my cork. Drank iot anyways, very glad I did. Pours a garnet tinged brown in color with the slightest of heads. Aroma is all yeast and figs. Flavor is at first very sweet from the malts, but followed up nicely by some a very sliught hop tones. However, the greatness of this beer comes with the fig and yeast flavors. Very rich and vibrant. Great beer for desert. Sweet with a nice bitter finish. Sharing this with a few others who all share my praises."
"Although the yeast character from this beer could contribute a greater depth of character with the estery/spicy balance and with the rate of dryness, this beer seems slightly less characterful than, say- Chimay Premiere or Westmalle Dubbel. But this classy Dubbel Ales isn't only an American gem, it's in the class with regal Belgian Dubbels like those of Grimbergen."
"Easily one of my favorites."
"Pick this one up."
"The beer pours a red tinged brown with little head. The nose is old fruit and yeasty basements. The taste is dark and deep with hops, fruit and other interesting things thrown in the mix. The beer tasted aged eventhough the bottling was fairly current. I loved how the beer matched strong cheese and never let up in the body or finish. One of the best of the North American versions of this style."
"Pour dark and murky, very beautiful, streams of carbonation rising up from the bottom of the glass. Large head fades into a thick creamy layer. Lots of alcohol raisins, and dark fruit in the nose, still has a raw smell to it. Taste also could benefit from some mellowing, but does have good variety of flavors in the mix, similar to the smell. Give this one a year or two and it would have been great, now it is just good."
"750 ml bottle brought from the brewery to me...thanks Mark G. One of 3,840 bottles aged at Howe Caverns at 156 feet at 52F from March 4, 2004 to September 30, 2004."
"note: i have not had the regular ommegang but will seek it out for a means of comparison"
"Poured from a 750ml bottle into an Affligem chalice. Dark, ruby-red color with a little bit of a white head that didn't stick around too long. Pleasant malty aroma. Taste is fairly complex; strong malt flavor, with quite a bit of raisin and candy sugar. Quite a dry mouthfeel, with a clean aftertaste. Delicious Belgian-style ale at a great price compared to the imports."
"I paired this with a 6 month aged gorgonzola."
"Another great offering from the folks at Ommegang. A peppercorn encrusted beef tenderloin would sing along in tune with this one. The price for a 750ml is a true value in the beer world. Have one, or two, on hand."
"Edit: After pouring in some yeast in the last glass, a nice spicy crispness emerged which I felt made this beer even better. I only poured in a little bit of the yeast though."
"Does the cave-aging make a difference. One man's opinion is a resolute ""yes."""
"-UF"
"Caved aged version is just about identical. Didn't really see anything different that stuck out."
"Cheers."
"Drinkability: Very tasty but not a bottle after bottle beer for me. Maybe it is too complex, but it is a beer to be enjoyed and savored, not pounded."
"I am the Contrarian, and seemed to be the only one to try this at Mondial Montreal 2005. The bottle did not stand out against the Fantomes, or maybe everyone thought they had the lineup. Their loss. Opaque reddish and smooth, medium mouthfeel. I like the yeast profile of this brewery, and this one was smelled significantly spicy."
"This is from the corked 750mL. Deep red tones combine with the tall head to give this glass a fantastic appearance. Head dropped to next to nothing within minutes, but this is not completely out of character for this style. My favorite part about the beer is the smell. Not as fruity as most Belgian styles, but rather consists of more flowery tones. I definitely dig it. A slight metallic finish is the only thing that interrupts the smooth malty taste. The alcohol is their but not dominant. The mouthfeel is creamy and finishes crisp. Overall, I like this beer a lot but the only part that really seperates it from other Belgian Abbeys is the different, complex aroma. That being said it, I am putting it up there with the most solid Dubbels I have tasted. Killer aroma!"
"Mouthfeel is awesome mild American version of making a Belgian and giving it a mild mouthfeel. Hard to do for a beer of this strength. They've done it in the drinkability category too. One of the best beers that is readily available. Pretty reasonably priced too. Excellent to match up with food."
"Bottle: Poured a burgundy lightly hazy color ale with a huge light brown head with perfect retention. Aroma is malty with traces of spices (pepper with a touch of cinnamon?). Taste is very enjoyable with a mix between some nice floral malt and some sweet dry fruit (raisin). Body is full and alcohol is well hidden. Very enjoyable and probably the best I had from Ommegang."
"IÂ’m not sure if itÂ’s just the cave aging or what, but I wouldnÂ’t be able to tell this is Ommegang if you gave me a blind taste test. The aging makes this a completely different beer. The rock taste really overpowers the Belgian dark ale taste. I found this a tough beer to swallow, although to give it credit, it is one of the most interesting beers IÂ’ve had in a long time."
"All in all a very nice beer."
"Poors in with nice lightbrown head and beautifull brown clouwdy beer. Nose is good and fresh also and has lots of fruity yeastesters and maltaromes. Gives you hints of vanilla, bananna, plumbs. Maltpart mainly done by light and caramelmalts though probably litle roast is used. Great and good balanced balgium styled beer that can hold up with the best. Bitterness and roast in aftertaste could be litle more IMO but this feels great in the mouth and poors away (too) easily."
"I can appreciate what the brewery was trying to accomplish and will try other styles made by Ommegang, but I will pass on this Belgian ale."
"All in all this beer is VERY good and I think I will drink it again...and again...and againÂ…"
"Drinkability: For 8.5%....damn good"
"Drinkablity: A very easy drinking Belgian, worthy of the high praise. At five bucks and change for a 750 (I purchased mine at Kevin Meier Imports here in Lincoln) an absolute unbelievable value, you can't get many good wines at that price. This is one I will purchase again when the mood strikes me, although I will limit my consumption to one at a time."
"Poured a deep hazy brown with hints of ruby/copper. It boasted a 2inch off white head that was fairly creamy with a touch of fizz to it that dwindled slowly and left lacing throughout. Aroma was chocolate and fruity with hints of port and raisin. The tatse is a big malt punch layered with chocolate and raisin. very fruity but not overly sweet at all. the fruit tastes were so well blended I could not pick any particular one out. The mouthfeel was full bodied and left a slight warming from the alcohol which was well hidden. almost too hidden which made this one even easier to drink. excellent"
"Pours out a dark ruby/brownish color with a tannish head. Some lacing was left on the glass, but not really that much. Nose was wonderful. All you need to do is just take a whiff and you'll get a bunch of aromas. Dark fruit, lots of spices yet there's a candy-like sweetness that goes along with the spiciness. Everything mellows together in here. This is also one of the better beer's I've tasted yet. Apples, banana, and other fruit stand out the most, along with a sweetness to go along with it. It's not cloying at all. The cave aging really mellows out this beer and all the flavors come together so well. This is only my second all 5s for a beer, and this beer deserves it. Truly an experience. (And worth the money)"
"This is one wonderfully fruity, busy beer. And that busyness is not a bad thing, as it makes it interesting and fun. The fruit and spice and tanginess combine to make this a very enjoyable warmer, but it is the ABV, obvious and pushy that limits just how much of it I would want in a sitting. But regardless, whatever amount I do decide to enjoy will be appreciated and anticipated once it's gone."
"Oh my god, OMMEGANG!"
"I have really come to like the Ommegang offerings. If you see this, grab it! Follow the recommendations on the bottle and enjoy."
"This is a great american attempt at a very difficult style of brew. The beer was lookin very nice as it flowed into my glass with a huge off white head and great dark reddish brown color. The smell was filled with alchoholic plum scents and a burnt maltiness that was very inviting. The taste was definantly on the sweet side with the malts taking a doppelbock-like front row seat and letting you know that it is there. The flavor explodes in your mouth with a rush and then the aftertaste is very dry which is not something that I have experienced too often....it was very nice. Worth a try for sure."
"Poured from a 750 ml into two goblets (spouse and I). Dark mahogany with beige head, some lacing. Smell early on was overpoweringly plastic. After about ten minutes it settled into a dark fruity alcohol smell. Taste is prunes, malt, pepper and alcohol. Finishes like an inexpensive tawny port. Mouthfeel is fruits and alcohol. Beer tastes bigger than it is. What an excellent digestif this would make. However, I had it with dinner, a hearty beef roast with a horseradish sauce and this beer more than holds it own with these flavors. The spouse is still raving about how good this beer is with this dish."
"poured a dark brown-amber murky mysterious color with moderate tan head that remained as fine lacing. The smell is of fruit mixed with the dark forest. The taste mathes the smeel with dark fruity overtones. Definitely a sipping beer, but each sip makes your want to have another. As it warms the flavor becomes even more pronounced. A great beer to enjoy with friends on a cool spring evening"
"Very smooth, creamy, very easy to drink, would be an outstanding cold weather drink or excellent for after dinner. Not your usual beer, but very enjoyable."
"Very drinkable, as good as many of the real Belgians at half the price. Will enjoy many of these in years to come."
"What a beautiful beer. Pours blood-amber with a very uniform head. Body is cloudy, head resilient. The most impressive part of the presentation is the head...it simply didn't quit. Smell of peaches and hay; very distinct but nothing outstanding. Sweet alcoholic intro followed by mild hops finishes with slight citrus. This beer stays around for a while. Carbonation carries the olfactory characteristics nicely. This is a heavy beer, I am not a huge brown ale fan, but this is pretty darn good."
"Pours with the color of merlot, with a diminishing head. Smells fruity, decent lacing on the glass. Taste is like a dry red wine, I get tannins and some oak flavor out of it. Where is the sweet malt? Where are the hops? Mouthfeel is okay, though thin. I don't think I'll look for this again. Might pair well with grilled steak, but not a beer to drink on it's own."
"This is by far the best representation of a Belgian beer I've had from this side of the pond. I knew from the moment I popped the cork that this one would be special. Speaking of the cork, that sumbitch required the use of a cork screw (something I've never had to do with a beer, it usually just pops right off with fairly little effort). There was a thick white fog sitting stale in the barrel full of a spicey, yeasty aroma. From the pour and presentation I could swear I was drinking a REAL Belgian. The beer pours to a dark burgandy color with a creamy tan colored foam that stays put at a quarter inch and laces beautifully. When poured, the same qualities I mentioned earlier becomes more ubiquitous also providing a hint of banana esters. The taste ranks up there with the finest Belgians I've had, seeming to have several of the same qualities of some of the trappist beers all rolled up into one. Has the yeasty/estery profile of a Chimay red, the appearance and crackling foam of a Westmalle dubbel, the mysterious tastes of Rochefort and Orval, etc. I will surely have to make this one of my staple beers whenever I return to the Omaha area."
"Pours a deep brown with amber showing through in direct light. Small beige head which faded quickly. Smells awesomely like some sort of sweet banana candy. Taste is more of the same--bananas and sweet malt. As sweet as every sip is, it's balanced well enough by the hops that it's never overwhelming. There is also a hint of the 8.5% alcohol--not horribly so, but could be masked a little. This is a nice beer to sip occasionally, but too sweet for me to turn into a session."
"Had a 12 ouncer poured into my Rochefort chalice last night with dinner, and it was super. I could drink these all day long."
"Like red wine? Give it a try. DonÂ’t? Pass."
"Drinkability and Overall: This beer wasn't anything special in my opinion. Ommegang's beers never really do a whole lot for me. It's good and all, better than your average beer, but a little over-rated. Go for a Unibroue instead."
"I'm quite impressed with this brew. A North American brewery that can brew belgians right is a beautiful thing. I'm looking forward to trying some of their other labels."
"candy sugar, fruity esters, bannana, nutty, yeasty bread. Tastes of sweet malts, green apples, noticeable hop bitterness, with a vinous quality and medium alcohol presence. Mouthfeel is medium to thick with some carbonation. Damn drinkable!"
"I do remember Brewery Ommegang's Rare Vos and Hennepin which my wife's aunt brought back from a brewery visit a few years back. They are also recommended. Good stuff!"
"I sampled a few glasses of this fine creation in brewing at the Blind Tiger's Ommegang night this past week. Large bottles, caged and corked with informational tag hanging from the bottle. This basically seems to be quite differant to the regular Ommegang mostly in the taste department. Caved aging has led to a slightly dryer, crisper, and a tad sourer product. I detected a slight tart note in the finish. Fine brew, added complexity from the cave aging. Got to give it up to Ommegang for taking the time and making the effort to improve their beers by trying something new/ancient and differant."
"Drinkability: Picked up a 750ml bottle for $4. That's definitely quite a steal for a beer of this caliber and abv. I'm not a big lover of Belgian strong ales, but they are nice to enjoy once in a while. This one is an excellent example of they style, no doubt. True to form in literally every way. A beer to be respected and enjoyed."
"Great tasting, easy drinking... 'specially next to a filet (like I had it)."
"Wonderfully complex, the drinkability of this beer cannot be overstated. It's quite potent, but goes down rather easily. A 750ml bottle may seem a bit much for one person, but it disappears quickly."
"I would consider this very drinkable if you are looking for a unique tasting brew. The high alcohol prevents mass consumption, but who would want to chug this? This is meant to be sipped. A fine beer that comes at a very good price. I would take this over the Belgian imports I've had, and plus, I'm supporting a New York brewery. You can't lose."
"Pours a hazy ruby brown with a huge tan colored head that had good staying power. Great lace. Smell of a good strong ""double"". Earthy and fruity. Plum, raisin and alcohol. Tatse is also very earthy and fruity. Flavors of plum, raisin, some vanilla slight orange. Nicely balanced - not a ton of hop flavor or aroma but that is due to the overwhelming complexity of the malts in this brew. It is hard to beleive that this is an American beer, and at $5 for a 750ml its a steal. Finishes dry and warming - it leaves your lips nice and sticky. Another great one by the folks at Brewery Ommegang"
"I'm glad I tried this, and for the low price at the store, it's something I probably will end up purchasing again."
"Nice sized 750 ml bottle (Purchased for $3) with a wire cover over the cork top. Dark colored bottle but still could see a little light through it all. Once poured, the head foamed up nice and suddy. Was colored an red and brown and looked nice and dark. Smelled fruity and hoppy; nice and light. And the taste was strong but smooth with dar tones. Something that felt good to drink (although carbonation sometimes gets to me round after round), warmed you up and made you want more. I drank the whole 750ml myself and will be buying another one on the next beer run."
"one of a kind."
"It's hard to believe this is brewed in the States. Ommegang and Hennepin have all of the complexities of some of Belgium's finest at a fraction of the price, plus easy availability. You got to love the shit out of that!"
"Corked 750ml bottle. Beautiful dark red/brown body, with tons of foamy head. Great head retention and good lacing make this a great beer to stare at. Spicy aroma, lots of sweet fruit coming through. Raisens, apples, but not too much. Nice and sweet, tastes much better once it has warmed a bit. My first couple sips it was really cold and I didn't like it, but now...wow. I wish I knew what that ""spice"" that Belgian style beers have is. Alcohol taste comes through a bit, and there's a dry finish. Great American Belgian, I'm glad the brewery is only an couple hours away!"
"This is a complex and full bodied beer that is easy to drink. It is not a thirst quencher, but a beer that can be savored"
"Nice creation from Ommegang; great bang for the buck; waiting for this ale to mature is a splendid idea, but keep some around for occasional consumption"
"This one holds up to all but the very best from across the pond. As we near $1.50 to 1 euro, I become more and more thankful for Ommegang."
"This is a fine strong brew that deserves respect. I enjoy most of the Ommegang family. This may be my favorite."
"Poured from a 12 ounce bottle. Dark brown with a large tan head. The smell is incredible. Rich, earthy aroma with caramel, carob, and Belgian yeast. The flavor is similar to the aroma, but with the addition of soy sauce. This detracts only slightly from the taste. Full mouthfeel, and pretty drinkable too. What a great beer this is, from one of the best breweries in the US."
"this one is fairly drinkable, the 8.5% could put you down pretty quick. i paid $4.99 for a 750 ml bottle. that's pretty cheap for a brew this good."
"This beer is only 3.69 for the 750- Perhaps one of the more economical pleasures available. The label suggests ""you can cellar this bottle."" I didn't have the patience this time around..."
"Hell yeah. I remembered that this beer was good, but wow. I really want to try this alongside the classic BSDAs because I know that it would hold its own."
"This went along definetly with the full bodied mouthfeel, considerably thick. properly carbonated. Very nice beer overall."
"Good last beer to review for 04!"
"Hmmm... I could really like this stuff. Especially at the price. Although (clearly) I'm a big Unibroue fan, this stuff really makes a strong case for my money, especially when it only asks half as much. It really does grow on you. If you don't like the first few sips, give it time- you will as it warms up a little."
"Should be enjoyed the way you enjoy a fine wine."
"Alcohol is well hidden and can be deceptive, so watch out :-)"
"Must've got a little warm, because this opened with a gusher. Fortunately, I saved most of it. A thin, fizzy head under a dark brown body. Has a deep, rich taste of molasses or brown sugar, with subtle spiciness and tart highlights. Carbonation gives it kind of a champagne-like texture. It's winey-sweet without being cloying, and I also get notes of slow charries and raisins. Pouring in the sediment from the bottom adds an impression of grape tannins. Very finely done."
"750 ml bottle. Ruby read pour with a huge tan head. Aroma of clove, banana, raisin, plum, and Belgian wonderfulness (yeast). Flavor explodes on the palate with sharp raisin notes and bittering hops, along with carmel maltiness. Way too drinkable in my opinion, and very dangerous. This is the standard of Belgians and belongs in my hall of fame."
"If Dr. Brown's Black Cherry could become beer, it would aim for this. I'm liking it more and more. Hmm. I wonder how it would match a pastrami sandwich?"
"Pours a deep, beautiful red/mahogany with a spotty head. I think it's a brand theme to have a deep esther/alcohol scent as one inhales, but the softer scents include grape, raspberry, cranberry, figs, grapefruit, and sharp fruity smells, which are also tones throughout the taste too. Tastes of pine, bark, peat, grape, and tart ripe fruits. Malty but with a smooth hop contrast. Delicious, very ""meaty," smooth full flavor. God I love this beer."
"Pours a deep mahogany brown with a good thicket of light tan head. Dark fruits, chocolate and a hint of caramelly molasses. Predominantly sweet, with some residual dryness in the finish from the hops. Very earthy and mild. Raw, cola-like carbonation. Some alcohol in the finish; but not too bad, it blends well with the light spice character of the beer. Overall, a very nice and enjoyable dark Belgian-style ale."
"I will try aging my own Ommegang and see if it was worth paying double to have it aged in a cave. So far...I think it was."
"A treat of a beer."
"Drinkability: It's ABV is low for such a big, complex, beer. That makes it more drinkable than others."
"Drinkability: Very; super-solid BSDA. Super value as well. You've got to love this brewery. Everything, as broad as their noble purpose, as specific as their packaging, just kicks ass. Please, please, oh God please keep it up."
"This one came in a 750mL corked bottle. Looks nice. Pours an amber color with a moderate head that stays around and leaves some lacing on the glass. The aroma is fruity (cherry), sweet malts, and a spicy yeast. Nice mellow flavor. Spicy yeast, malts, sweetness, alcohol, and a slight fruitiness. The alcohol is apparent, but not overwhealming. This is a nice beer."
"The mouthfeel was very pleasant smooth and rich. A full flavored and bodied beer that is now one of my favorite Belgian styles."
"This beer was served in a corked bottle. I delicately poured out a dark brown brew that had reddish undertones. A nice 2 inch sustained fluffy head appeared. The nose was spicy and fruity, perhaps a hint of cinanmon thrown in. Taste was of caramel malts that are perhaps slightly toasted and with a hint of chocolate. A slight dry hop finishes the taste. The high alcohol content is well balanced and disguised. There is a nice full mouthfeel to this brew. It is highly carbonated but noy overly lively on the palate. The overall drinkability is good but one is definitely enough in one sitting. This would be a good brew to serve during the holidays."
"I could drink this stuff all night at a classy restaurant while everyone else sips on their wine. Definately not as filling as I had expected."
"My 750ml bottle of Ommegang was corked and crowned. Pours a cloudy, deep, red-brown with a thick, creamy tan head. Aroma is spicy, with coriander and some sour fruit. Taste is complex: sour fruit, with coriander, clove and maybe some light banana, against a backdrop of yeasty sourdough malt. Ommegang is lightly carbonated and medium bodied, with a slight warmth from the alcohol on the way down. This beer is very drinkable, and very affordable as well - the big bottle can be had for $3.50 in my area."
"Drinkability is good but high ABV makes it a one time per day beer. Additionally, the 3 Philosophers was a much better offering from this brewery."
"This was the last bottle from a case purchased a year ago, yet there is no dating to be found on the bottle. The aromas are quite sweet with loads of molasses, maple syrup, cocoa and an alcohol-fueled perfume of allspice. Dark brown, the liquid passes unsweet flavors of burned sugar, licorice, beef broth and acorns to the mouth. Charred applewood, demerara Rum, boysenberry and smoked pepper images all can be teased from this beautiful drink.The texture is hurried by alcohol and reveals more complex structure than I can recall from this brand: angular, rustic and filled with humid botanical fragrance."
"Taste of malt, foreign spices, sugars, and belgian speciality yeast. Honey and hints of plum on the finish. A rich tasting beer that is complex in flavors and smooth."
"Nice one, great flavors and good drinkability."
"-Oelergud"
"DA: Yeh, its a good purchase. I'll buy it again."
"Beer is good. Happy beering."
"The beer is a deep crimson brown in color. The head is about 2 fingers high that falls to a quarter inch over the beer. The nose is somewhere between a dark caramel and the fig I get from a good Belgian. Its kind of enigmaic for me. The flavor is not quite as strong as I would like it to be. The malts are present, but they are not n my face. This one is also a bit thin for my liking. Drinkability is high, but I think this is at a sacrifice from the other aspects of this beer."
"I had this quite a while back, and I was suprised to see that I hadn't reviewed it. I had it again, and what a wonderful, unique brew. This is the maltiest Belgian-styled beer I can remember having. Reminds me of Scottish Ale, with the sweet bisquity malt backbone. A nice, foamy head sits atop a dark ruby brew. Full and creamy, bursting with fruity flavors. I can't wait to get more. Better than I remember, and (once again) quite unique."
"Overall, the beer is very spicy and warming. A nice apertif... definitely would not want to drink more than 2."
"The taste was wonderful... it was well carbonated and dry, with apple and banana flavors mingled with a light spicy hoppiness. A very good beer to end a night of sampling with."
"It's a good beer, but the spices and the bubbly mouthfeel make it a little less appealing to me. Still very drinkable, just not something I would probably enjoy often. Still, at three and a half bucks for 750 ml, it's a good buy for a good beer."
"This beer poured a deep, deep brown, with a 1 inch head of mostly fine grain bubbles. There was a delicate lace, but it did not retain. The nose is just a faint hint of malt. I didnÂ’t get much of the aroma. The taste has just a hint of a black cherry (the malt?), but this beer is definitely defined by the malt. I donÂ’t really feel or taste the hops at all. It has a medium/light mouth feel (surprisingly), and a medium/high drinkability. This is a god attempt at an abbey style, but IÂ’ve had better."
"Deep brown hue with red reflects. Honest light brown head. Malty and yeasty nose rich of fruity overtones (prune, apples) and chocolatey. Initial sweet attack which is not unbalanced thanks to a long yeasty dry finish. Alcohol noticeable, but undistracting. Round medium body with very high carbonation, although not as much as rare vos luckily. Pretty good, but IÂ’ve yet to be truly impressed by a dubbel and I must say that Ommegang has never impressed me all that much besides Three Philosophers."
"Drinkability: It would be hard to drink more than a few, but good for the style, as I see it."
"Highly recommended."
"Overall/Drinkability: A sipping brew that sneaks up on you. I don't have much more to say. Outstanding. Execellent. Superb. Great. I want more!"
"A nice treat for the palate due to the ale's complex flavors, but not a beer that I could drink all night. A nice American version of a great style to enjoy on occassion."
"Drinkability: At $3.99 for a 75mL bottle, this can't be beat."
"Drinkability: Excellent. I never have a problem finishing the 750 mL bottle. This is a really great beer and a great value. Quite the US interpretation of a Belgian beer."
"cloudy chesnut red with an awesomely creamy and dense layer of tan foam that ain't going anywhere. sticky patches of lace coat the goblet. sweet caramel and fruitcake aroma with a hint of medicinal phenol character. lively carbonation, slightly fizzy, yet still very smooth and rich. bursting with dark fruit, cherry-like flavors. slick and sweet with ample caramel character that is more pleasant than it sounds. goes sort of medicinal in the middle with a phenolic character that is there for balnce, yet seems just slightly off-kilter. finishes with a peppery noble hop bite that quite satisfying. alcohol stays mostly hidden, and this is easy drinkin' for such a big, bold, and flavorful ale. one of the best american-brewed belgian style ales that i've ever had, made even more attractive at its price relative to other beers of this style and character. nice job."
"Served from a bomber into a goblet glass. this beer was way more than I was expecting it to be. Beautiful, dark, ruby red rust color, excellent glass lacing and clarity makes for a very attractive and inviting presentation. Aroma of port, dried cherries, and dulce de leche. Tastes as a little bit of heaven. again notes of cherry, caramal apple; a port effect gives it a subtle, mellow hint of alchohol. A lingering, warming sweetness that carrys itself well from the bottle to the glass to the tongue and down. It seems to envelope the body, preparing and paving the way for the next wonderful sip. This is truly an exceptional beer that I greatly enjoyed this night with an amazing cheese and fruit plate. Try it and savor it. I don't think that you will be dissappointed."
"750 ml bottle. Poured a red-red-brown, dark red bordering on brown with a big head like expected from a belgian style. Very nice appearance. The smell threw up the first warning flag on this beer. It smelled like a Belgian, only more so. Overpowering smell. The taste backed this up. The fruity/sweet tastes are there, only subtle and in the background. The spicy and expecially peppery tastes overpower taste buds. A very complex taste, different mouthfuls varied from smooth to extremely harsh. I think a little too much of a good thing. I had no interest in having another of this beer. I wonder if cellaring a bottle away for a year or so wouldnt smooth out this beer and take it up a notch. I think my overall impression is raw, harsh, and overdone."
"(25.4 oz. / 750 ml corked champagne style brown bottle with a wire cage)"
"Pours a brownish red, but primarily red with a frothing head. Unfortunately, it doesn't stay, but the ring around the glass keeps me company for a while. The smell is... well, I kind of want to say plums or raisins, but I can't really remember what they smell like. The smell is caramelly with hints of spiced fruit. It kind of reminds me of the winter holiday season even though I don't celebrate. It's grassy and sweet, almost like holding hands with your girlfriend while lying on a cool autumn lawn during twilight. The taste of spiced fruit, but with a strong spice backbone and that sweetness that gives it a slightly spicy body, without being too cloyingly sweet or full. The alcohol is definitely present, though. I like this one. Carbonation is light and defers to the taste. I should get this in smaller bottles or find someone else to split it with. Though definitely not my favorite, a good strong beer. The price, as well, is quite nice."
"Overall a bit unbalanced due to the strong pepper and spices, and slightly thin mouthful, but not bad. Begs to be aged."
"After all of the promise & intrigue of the nose, the actual taste turns out to be a bit of a let down. Everything promised in the nose is there, but the whole thing seems muted & dull. Nothing really pops. I am at least digging the way the licorice flavour lingers on after the finish."
"Brewery Ommegang is one of my favs for sure."
"This is a very tasty Belgian style dark ale that cost less than many similar imports. It can also be found in 4 packs of 12oz. bottles for those times you may only want one glass of beer."
"Flawless in appearance. This one is indeed burgundian with a soft head and slightly transparent body. It smells and tastes very fruity, but the taste shows a little more alcohol. The taste combines some apple-ish and red grape flavors that linger pleasantly in the aftertaste. If the alcohol was hidden a bit more, this would be one hell of a beer. As it stands, it is very good and one that I'm sure I'll return to."
"Dark, 'burgundian' in color with a voluminous off-white head. Smells of dark fruits rich malts some hint of yeast and cocoa. Taste is rich and full and of chocolate covered dates, raisins or plums. Lots of different peppery spices fill the palate and there is a dry wine-like finish. Medium carbonation full-mouthfeel and malt texture and oh so smooth and drinkable. An all around fantastic brew."
"An okay beer, but not the end-all for Belgian darks. The strong nuttiness on the finish was a nice surpise, but the alcohol could have been hidden a little better."
"Nice and creamy in the mouth; smooth, nice carbonation...just floats around your tounge. Semi-medium body. So easy to drink, good to go with a hearty meal."
"A classic dubbel, I can't believe I've never taken notes on it. A thankfully ubiquitous brewery. My only problem is the widely varying beer this can become depending on its storage; each bottle has been too ranging from the previous."
"dark somewhat cloudy slightly ruby, brown with a big tan head. floral smells, almost like lavender, along with brown sugar, and apple and pear. banana also as it warms. fruity and complex taste: the brown sugar and pears, plus clove and hints of chocolate and cherries come through. slight breadiness on occasion as well as some pepper. a little fig/prune taste as well, but it's subtle. finishes with some hops and bitter fruit flavors. thicker side of medium mouthfeel, with more carbonation than expected. i'd like fo rthis to be a bit drier. a really good belgian style ale, i'll be trying some more from this brewery."
"Ommegang (Abbey Ale) is a pretty fair representation of a Belgian Strong Dark Ale and is a quality brew if that's your thing. It isn't mine, at least not at this point in time, but I respect this beer all the same."
"This is a great american belgian. It is exceptionally affordable and very well worth every penny. I will definitely come back to this one again."
"This is a fine effort and immenently drinkable. If not entirely true to style, it is so tasty that the minor transgressions on tradition are easily forgotton."
"Dark brown pour with a rich tan head. Nice liveliness and lacing. The nose mildly sweet with hints of prune and fig and there is an evident pinch of spice in the mix as well. The taste starts lightly earthy and build up towards a semi sweetness that includes dull black licorice, molasses and prune/raisin. On the finish there also seems to be a tart woodiness that creeps in ever so slightly. A good mouthfeel that is lively and medium bodied. A subtle version of a strong dark Belgian that does a good job in remaining well balanced without being over the top."
"A nice tan tan head resting over an dark amber body. Aroma is strong with hints of alcohol, fruit and other sweet notes. Taste is definately full flavored, there is a lot going on here. I sense pepper, some raisins, and a good dose of alcohol. Mouthfeel was a bit thinner than it's cousin Hennepin but still smooth and well carbonated. Drinkability suffers a bit as this is one fatiguing brew."
"Good mouthfeel, very drinkable, easy to quaff. Brewery Ommegang really did a fine job with this ale. This easily matches it's peers from across the ocean. They're not merely aping the style, they're building their own complexities into this beer. A great effort."
"This stuff is among the most drinkable stuff on earth."
"Wow!! That is the first thing that comes to mind when you pop one of these open and see what lies ahead. Wonderful dark brown with orange hues when held upto the light. The aroma is full with sweet malt and yeast. The head comes up strong and slowly disolves into a scattered heavy film with fairly heavy lacing. The taste is very dry at first and a taste of raison hits the tongue. Chocolate follows with a nice finish. There is definately a rough texture in the finish though. Overall, this beats many from Belgium and is a wonderful, wonderful beer!"
" Rich and full of malty/ fruit flavors that works with hearty dishes or dessert or all by itself."
"Pours a brown body that turns the deepest shade of ruby when held to the light with a light leather colored head and some splotches of lace. The nose first picks up huge notes of alcohol that drift away slowly into banannas and dark malts. The alcohol maskes a lot of the scents. Taste was of dark fruitiness, creamy mellow smoothness, slight chocolate flavors and tons of warming alcohol. The mouthfeel is spritzy and highly carbonated until the yeast is added then it gets mellower. In fact the whole taste gets much more palateable after the yeast. This beer has a lot of promise, but falls well short. The alcohol dominates the nose and the flavor, which is a shame because this could be a great beer. This could do with some serious aging and in my opinion is the weakest offering of Ommegang's"
"Cheers to the Belgians!"
"It pours a dark carmel with tints of red. It developed a finger of tan head that settled to a nice film. The smell was very complex with multiple fruits, including raisan, apple, and grape, with some spicieness. A very winey taste with a lot of complexity. There is a good maltieness up front and a distinct alcohol taste, this is rounded out with a viariety of fruit and spice flavors. There are traces of vanilla and a twist of hop in the finish. The feel is smooth and oily. A nice fresh alternative to the imported Belgians, but unlikely to supplant them."
"My biggest ""problem"" with Ommegang is that I find it to be a statement of intent. It goes down so easily that a person could drink a couple 750s without thinking about it. Of course, at that point, thinking will no longer be an issue. I also feel that there is a certain bias against domestic Â“BelgiansÂ” but I would urge everyone to forgive OmmegangÂ’s domesticity and compare it directly to its heritage. Not only is that fair, but I think any Belgian fan would be more than impressed with what can be produced in the States."
"Notes: The alcohol is very present in this beer. It may or may not ruin the fruits and wheaty tastes, it depends on what you like."
"Poured out a dark reddish brown color with a medium-sized, even head. Sweet caramel aroma with some estery notes. Sugary malt taste, followed by a somewhat bitter aftertaste and just a little bit of alcohol to it. Mouthfeel is at once mellow and refreshing."
"Not bad stuff! Fairly complex, fruity and malty, with a good head and good blackish color. Nothing here that absolutely WOWed me, but then again, nothing at all to complain about either. I liked the Three Philosophers a bit more, but a decent showing from Ommegang."
"At $3.99/750ml, this is easily the best Belgian bang-for-your-buck. A mahogany body with a moderately-sized pale tan head. A lot of yeast and alcohol in the nose. The taste follows up in much the same manner with faint notes of chocolate and cider. It's a very drinkable beer once you get into it, and I can see myself buying many an Ommegang 750 in the future."
"This is a very tasty brew and I am glad I finally tried it. It is smooth and drinkable, complex yet easy to enjoy and not overanalyze."
"I have been hesitant to buy this. I don't know why, but I have been. It pours a very deep amber colour with a copper tint. The head was very big and hass lasted a while. The scent was the fruitiest smell I have ever had. Apples, berries and a hint of lemon make up the aroma. The taste was also equally as fruity. It has an apple taste along with kind of a bready taste. It is finished by a wonderful hoppy bitterness. Though it isn't the most carbonated beer in the world, it sure felt like it. It goes down sharply."
"I don't know what everyone was thinking rating this beer in the top 50. This beer is almost disgusting. Pretty bad as soon as I opened it. Smell is fruity but full of alcohol. Smelled like propane with mashed figs. Taste was far worse than the aroma. Not really malt and hops but more like chemicals and raw alcohol. I tasted sweet-n-low and a stong artificial tangyness. There was a cherry aftertaste, but who would go through all those nasty ass flavors just to get to the aftertaste? I can't see anyone enjoying this beer. Sure, this beer is strong and will put you on your ass, but if thatÂ’s what you like, why not just drink Bud Ice instead? It tastes better than this crap! The only good thing going for this brew is its appearance - dark red body (the taste might make you guess it was Red #40) with a huge tan head. After about 4 or 5 sips I couldn't take it anymore and poured the rest of this sickening liquid down the drain."
"just a superior overall product. great value, too. sells for as low as $3.50 a bottle here. taste is definitely on par with other beers in its style. a classic strong dark ale. i highly recommend this."
"Oak, fruit, citrus? flavors after a malty, alcohol, fruity smell. Drinking this after half a glass of Old Horizontal and it definitely has some of the strength of OH with more of a wine like taste that was very interesting. Alcohol presence was very evident....extremely dry finish that was very nice. For the high abv, a sippable, drinkable offering. Different brew, with interesting qualities."
"Drinkability: Reminiscent of Chimay Blue, but with rougher edges, perhaps reflected in the lower price point."
"A 750 presents no problems when it comes to drinkability"
"amazingly complex, fruity and bitter. Amazing hops. Most complex beer I have had. Well at least in the top five. A malty complex carbohydrate sweetness. This is the ultimate ""belgian"". Big malt, refined sweetness, intellegent use of hops, balanced, yet big. I love it."
"This beer has a dense and rich moutfeel, but is very drinkable. Altogether a quality product."
"The taste? Orange. Cherries. Apricot. Plums. Every once in awhile I got a slight sweet malty-vinegar taste. Complex and delicious. After continuing to drink, I started to notice the delcious oily mouthfeel. And kept drinking more. It's 8.5% ABV, but I could drink this stuff all night long (and be quite happy)."
"Pours with a light brown head atop a hazy amber colored beer. The head is quite thick. The aroma; at first I detect raisin and a bit of rum, then I get some subdued notes of sherry. The taste is a bit spicy with some light sherry notes to it. This beer has a fairly good amount of body to it as well. The finish is slightly on the hot side, spicy. This aged example tastes meaty, this would go well with a red meat dish."
"I enjoy the Belgian brews and I heard this American take on it was very nice so I gave it shot. Paid only $4.89 for the 750ml bottle. Chilled it until dinner and poured into a wide mouth glass. Dark brown with a frothy tan head. Great lacing as the head settled. Smelled very much of the Belgian style with fruity tones over a nice roasted malt aroma. Tasted excellent. Very fruity. Spices mixed well in this. 8.5% abv so it warms the soul quickly. An excellent American take on the abbey style ale. Try it out."
"Poured a hazy rich brown with a good sized tan head that retained fairly well and developed into a thin film over the beer. Aroma of rich fruits, deep malts and alcohol. Taste was of sweet raisins, caramel and molasses. A dark liquor consistency with a slightly dry malty finish. I had two in a row and I would say that's the limit for me. It hard to believe that this is an American beer."
"I truly fell in love with the Belgian Abbey style after this beer. A definately eye opener and an exceptional ale!"
"Very complex and big. Lots of chewy mouthfeel and texture with this one."
"At my Wegmans grocery store this stuff is a steal.. about $4.25 for a 25 oz bottle! Same for Ommegang's two other brews. I'd better buy a bunch of them before they hike up the price!"
"For session drinking, or everyday meals, I like Hennepin and Rare Vos better, but this is great with a special occasion meal. At the brewery, they gave us some semi-sweet chocolate with it that really enhanced the flavors, and it works very well with not-too-sweet desserts, a cheese plate, or fruit and biscotti."
"This beer poured a very dark amber color and formed a medum full tan head that coated the glass with lace as it subsided. A medium amount of carbonation is present. An aroma of malt, caramel, and spices. The flavor has elements of malt, citrus and spices. The finish is a bit bittersweet with some astigency. No a bad beer."
"$3.99 for 750ml."
"Much more of a winner than I'd believed. Fairly cheap too. This will regain a spot in my rotation."
"This beer has become my standby for the Dark Belgian style of beer. Brewed in New York, the price is half that of my favorite imports in the same style, and the flavor is fully their equal."
"750 mL bottle, no date on bottle."
"Surprisingly, I seemed to detect more in the nose before pouring the yeast in. I initially picked up grapes, peaches, coriander, and alcohol. After pouring the yeast, they are less noticeable, and a more spicy clove aroma is present. The mouthfeel seems to settle as well post yeast, and is less carbonated and has less of a bite to it. Flavor has a good deal of spices, in addition to some strong grape/winey notes. Slightly fruity middle, finishes dry with a mild alcohol taste."
"Update Â– After having a few of these over the last year I decided to re-review it for 2004. I seem to have gotten used to the light licorice flavor at the finish of this ale so upped the Â“DrinkabilityÂ” rating from 4.0 to 4.5."
"Poured a deep, dark rootbeer color with a medium tan head that retained at a small film. Aroma is strong and of sweet, dark fruit, caramel, and alcohol, along with some typical Belgian characteristics. While the aroma was very sweet it was toned down a little in the flavor. Taste was also very much like molasses, along with maple, prunes, and malt. Mouthfeel was medium bodied with a medium-high level of carbonation. I did like this, but prefer the Hennepin as this one is not as light and drinkable as the Henne."
"All in all this brew is a wonderful example of this style, as all Ommegang brews tend to be. This and Unibroue Trois Pistoles are currently two of my favorite Belgian styled dark ales. Very nice!"
"very complex flavors here, impressive indeed. a slight sour pervades through a gamut malts. malted to the hilt all around. strawberry and a slight hint of sugar with a wonderful wild cherry. tart and earthy malt go to war but it's not overplayed, in fact, it's fun to witness. only a bit of spices and they are welcome. there's actually a green veggy taste on the finish, it's cucumber and some bitter herbs. the mouthfeel is bubbly and heavy, chewy. although i liked it alot i wouldn't term it as super drinkable by any means. it's specialized."
"I would have preferred this beer if it had a little more carbonation. It had a flat appearance and taste. Overall though, it is a thoroughly drinkable beer, but not quite the effort of Ommegang's Hennipen Ale."
"While the head dissapears rather quickly, the beautiful ruby glow of the liquid more than makes up for it. The taste is mellow, alcoholic, and a bit malty. It may take half a bottle, but after a while you can feel the beer dance along your tongue, slide down your throat, and warm your belly."
"I had the 750 ml cork version of this beer. It poured nice and thick, good strong head with plenty of flavor. when it settled it had a nice brown/red color with a medium to thick body. The aroma was a little spicy but not over the top. a good strong taste of sweet Carmel and spicy fruit nice dry finish not to whiny!!"
"Dark brown beer with a thick light tan head that fades to a sticky Belgian lace. Prune, rum, and yeast notes were in the aroma. The taste was very malty with some spiciness and rum notes. Had a very heavy mouth, but wasn't chewy. Definitely a big beer."
"This is about the best looking beer I have seen. Dark brown with a nice long lasting creamy colored head. I have a cold but I can smell fruit malt and raisons. The taste is one of a kind. Smokey, hit of cherry(I think) cocoa with fruit in the background. The cocoa sticks around after you are done drinking this. I did not notice any alchohol. I bet I will by the time I drink this big bottle! Cheers!"
"A very bold, strong belgian ale, extremely authentic. The sweetness, along with the alcohol, gets to be a little too much, and one or two glasses is all I can take in a sitting. The price is also impossible to beat, especially for the quality of the product."
"If all the disgusting aspects of Robitussin could be removed and replaced with tasty beer, this is what you'd take for a cough. As it stands, it cuts through a stress headache quite nicely."
"This beer smells great. Get a good bit of alcohol smell but is blended into a bunch of other scents as well, I'm definately getting an intense raisin smell and some other stuff too that I can't quite pick out. The taste, however, isn't outstanding. Its good, don't get me wrong, with some of the same raisin notes and a little sourness, but it is nothing better than a Corsendonk. I guess that isn't much of an insult, but after the Hennepin, I was expecting more from their beefier beer."
"Very full mouthfeel, almost chewy. Very delicious. Courtesy of feloniousmonk, thanks man."
"Medium brown color, medium head. Aroma is malty and sweet. Rich smooth malts almost fruity. Nice hop signature. Finish is very clean, good mouth feel. Aftertaste is malty. The maltyness shines through on the finish. Smooth taste despite 8.5 % alcohol. Nice beer."
"This was my first brew from Ommegang and I wasn't expecting much, but was very pleasantly surprised. The style is usually a bit winey, but in this case is was less so in palate but had a Burghandy nose, color but with a very thin head. The finish was quite lingering and moved from a slight prune sweetness to a dryer finish. This a nice style that is well captured."
"Overall, a pretty good beer. Rather strong alcohol content takes away from the drinkability. Not one I'd sit around drinking on a routine basis. Probably best to have with a good meal."
"John"

"Overall - A pretty big and bold beer. Exceptionally well crafted. After finishing my first glass, I got a real desire for some fries with mayonnaise sauce. So into the oven they went and out came the Evan Williams bourbon. A bit of bourbon mixed with mayo (Monk's Cafe style), that second glass of Ommegang and those french fries with bourbon mayo and I was loving life. Now that's a good pairing."
"12oz. bottle poured into a tulip-style glass. It pours a dark brown color with one finger of light tan head. There is a minimal amount of lace on the glass. The smell is a mix of sweet, slightly toasted malt and alcohol. Very rich and powerful aroma. The taste is heavy with malt, ripe plums and raisins, and a touch of hops. It has a sweet dry finish, almost wine-like. The mouthfeel is very strong and heavy. The drinkability is average for the amount of alcohol. A good beer to be slowly sipped."
"Amongst the driest Belgian-style brews that I've had, and though I prefer a bit of sweetness in my beer, this certainly isn't a bad beer.........just something that's a bit of an acquired taste."
"Around this time one year ago, I was living in SoCal and trying different beers. This is probably the first dark Belgium style strong ale I tried, but at the time I had no idead what I had in my grasps. It's been a great time enjoying and experiencing all of the beers I have sampled, but it sure is nice to revisit this amazingly true to it's country of origin Ommegang ale. Appears mahogany brown with amber hazed hues shimmering through matched by a creamy tan effervescent massive head coating my goblet with trickled lace very nicely, some true eye candy in my hand here. Aromatics are this beer's forte, fortified with robust brown sugar coated simmered fruit namingly plums a rolling malt sweetness so gentle and perfect this beer is. Other aroma evident are the slight hop aroma delicate and light, but evident along with trace of alcohol notes to finish off the smell. Taste is just as easily a winter warmer as a summer sipper well-made and meaty this beer is packed wtih taste slightly nutty quality with cream laced fruit massive complex tones so good you just have to try it for yourself, my my hey hey Belgium style beer is better to drink than to piss away. I don't know what that was but what I meant is this an amazing example of what the American craft brewing seen is capable of it speaks volumes on so many levels of brewing textured with silky smooth qualities and a full medium body astonishing mouthfeel. Drinkability is grade A as far as after I finish this beer I indefinitely want another taste of it. 25.6 oz is enough for anyone especially 8.5% percent by volume, however this beer is to be enjoyed and paired with great food."
"Deep burgundy hue with a trifling murk. Covered by a beige, thick, steadfast head. Exiguous, wandering near - lace remains. The aroma is a delicate, amiable melange of stately barely ripe banana, rich nutty carob, and mild herbal phenols. After a deliberation, breezy wafts of semisweet cocoa dusted, fermented prune provide a lightly sugared, fruity contrast. Mellow, rounded dark toffee sweetness incipient in flavor is ensued and complemented by a persistent, fruit driven combination of fructose rich raisin and tracely tart underripe plum. As the beer breathes, judicious cocoa and a subtle, earthy hop presence emerge, facilitating an agreeable bittersweet contrast to the residual sweetness. Dark fruit character fades late, but banana esters remain constant, and couple with the light, but perceptibly grainy, bready malt undertone to facilitate a chocolate tinged banana bread impression. After the brief initial carbonic acid bite dissipates, the mouthfeel becomes invariably lightly viscous and pleasantly dextrinous. Finishes with a brusque snap of clove phenol that yields to fleeting hints of sweet, British digestive biscuits. The cellaring has completely assuaged the light, but perceptibly phenolic edge of regular Ommegang, which was already a fine brew. Chocolate character has augmented slightly, while the dark fruity esters have diminished. The end result is a superbly balanced dubbel - esque brew, with superlative drinkabilty. It's affably soft on the palate and certainly delicious. I wish to sincerely thank Feloniousmonk for delivering bottle # 214 to me."
"Caramely brown with amber highlights and a monstrous, fluffy head. Not surprisingly, the abundant head makes for a rich nose, with fruit notes, sweet malts, and alcohol all readily detectable. Reminiscent of some red wines I've had. Very rich, creamy mouthfeel is offset by a lightness at the back of the tongue and roof of the mouth. Sweet, full, malt base slowly melts away to leave a light crispness and, in the end, the warmth of alcohol. The scent and taste of alcohol seemed to increase as the beer warm (or as I grew more accustomed to the other flavors)."
"It had a strong flavor to it even though it had a light body. Dark fruits were noticed (dates, raisins, prunes) along with a light honey taste. Further along I detected a woody presence in the beer. The finish reminds me of a red wine along with oak. This is a great beer for the price, but if you have the money I would recommend getting a true belgian (i.e. beer from Belgium)."
"A decent rush of carbonation greets the opener. Perhaps surprisingly then, this brownish-red, murky beer forms only a medium-sized head that dissipates quickly. Stirring the beer brings about a ressurection of foam and a little lacing on the glass. Chocolate covered raisins and spices in the aroma with an tinge alcohol that presents itself more as the beverage warms. Flavors are deep, rich, and fruity -- ripened plums and raisins leading to a an unripe plum-skin bitterness. Despite the obvious fruity flavors, this beer is hardly as sweet as some other abbey style ales. It has a slightly stronger body a little bit more of a grainy base. Very drinkable brew hides its abv well."
"Deep hazy caramel color, with a light brown head of small tight bubbles. The head dissipates quickly, and leaves no lacing. Aroma is light, a bit malty, and a bit fruity like pear, but also has a slight alcoholic smell that almost seems metallic. Taste is big and rich. Heavy malt, with yeasty highlights, and a bit of hops and fruit. A hop bitter and malt sweetness lingers in the back of the throat. A metallic alcohol undertone matches the smell. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy. A very tasty beer that would be more drinkable for me if the metallic notes could be reduced."
"Thanks to Linc again for this one. To quote a friend, the aroma was of whiteboard markers. There was also a bit of fuel, raw alcohol and caramel in the aroma. The palate, is caramelly, and candied, with some raw alcohol in the finish, a bit rough and short. It didn't really taste Belgian to me either, not bad. Palate is a bit too sticky or something."
"The beer pours ""a dark burgandy"" just as the label states. The head, thick and full, is a dark white/tan color. It's quite hazy, but no bother. The aroma is good. It smells of liquorice, corriander, and ginger. The flavor is rich and powerful. The 8.5% abv. is evident as it slips down your throat. It's a great beer. Again, it is good with gourmet dishes. ""Great beer derserves great food"" as they proclaim on the bottle. The star anise shines through on the taste buds. It's spicy, but calm with it's darkness. The mouthfeel is heavy, but what do you expect?; Dark beer, bottle conditioned, spices. It is plenty drinkable, but I would advise not to drink too much; You might just end up passed out early."
"I gave this one the respectable slow pour a belgian style dubble deserves. 2"" creamy white head diminished to a rim and fine lacing within 5 minutes. A deep reddish brown with small traces of light through the glass. Sweet smell of ripe cherrys which becomes perfume-like as you sip. Taste is also sweet ripe cherries with a mild apple core aftertaste (not at all unpleasant). There is a medium body and very smooth mouth feel which bring increase its drinkability. Already my favorite 'domestic belgian'. I am very partial to belgian style ales and this domestic brew makes me fall in love all over again. Sweet, smooth, and very drinkable despite a 8.5% ABV, the way a belgian should be."
"-F"
"The Cave did it's work well. This is one kick@$! beer!"
"This is an excellent beer. Perhaps the second best American execution of the style (after the Allagash). With any luck we'll be able to start getting it out here on a regular basis."
"The color was a nice dark maroon color with a fruity smell. Not bad.. The taste was not my type though..It was a heavy beer with almost a sweet taste almost like a chocolate. The aftertaste was very smooth and dry but again the type of beer is not my type. Those who like the style will enjoy this hearty brew."
"Have a few Of all Brewery Ommegand offerings and this is a good one. It had a nice caramel color and a nice head of fine bubles that disipates reasonably slow. It has a a dry quality in the middle and sweetness all around. The most stand out taste for me was of pruines and gave it a nice rich mouthfeel. This one is a great deal for $5. I would try the Hennepin if you like this one, I think it is their best offering."
"It was damn good and left me wanting another once I had finished the 750ml bottle."
"Originally sampled on 23 January 2002. This beer is chocolate brown in color w/ a light foamy head. The taste is sweet yet tart w/ a very clean finish. A very unique beer, well worth the price. Ommegang is a very nice American version of a belgian ale."
"Simply phenomenal, if this is what I have to look forward to from the Belgian brews then I am rushing to them. Is this the finest American brew there is?"
"A great beer, and an amazing value at $3.50 for a 750 ml bottle. Pours a beautiful semi-opaque reddish-brown with a nice fluffy, sticky beige head. Very potent! Smells and tastes of fruit (apples, raisins...). Dangerously good. I just had a whole bottle to myself, and I don't particularly feel like moving!"
"Poured a hazy, ruby brown with a cream, thick brown head. Aroma of yeast, dark fruit, alcohol and a sweetness. Head flavor was slightly tart and yeasty. Alcohol comes across in flavor and mouthfeel. Belgian yeast and dark fruit are most notable on the tongue. A slight sweetness and lingering tartness are also present. A very nice brew that I am happy to have available in the Seattle area."
"This dark ale kicked my butt and I can't wait to have it again."
"Ommegang is one of the great US interpretations of a great Belgian style ale. A wonderful beer."
"Smells fantastic with lots of fruit and malt tones, mostly citrus with some melon, grape, raisin, and fig all dancing around with a super sweet malt in the nose thats soft and subtle. Taste is pretty much in your face with a whole lotta of malt thats sweet and lends into the the tropical feel and taste of melon and some citrusy bitterness and vanilla. Feel is medium bodied, silky smooth with a huge bitterness in the end that really soured to much for me. It started nice, but I think perhaps a little more aging would calm the bittery end down some. Not bad at all, pretty drinkable, is darn good and sip worthy as it warms."
"This is a great beer for the style, everything exist in harmonious bliss."
"What can I say butÂ…WOW! Pours a beautiful ruby/garnet red with a decent sized creamy, tan head that dissipated quickly. Wonderful aroma of plums and cherries came across with hints of sweet caramel. Had a very nice taste, which complemented the smell quiet well. The alcohol seemed to send a burst of warmth through my throat and stomach. A sweet aftertaste of plums left me wanting more. This is an excellent Belgian style beer and very affordable for those of us on a seemingly tight budget."
"Fruits are dominant, but they are not alone. The darks malts are blended in very well, and the pale malts also add a great character to the beer. I get a strong taste of celestial seasons ""wild cherry berry tea"" with a bit of sugar in this one. The carbontion is in perfect balance, and it keeps it under control. This brweis very enjoyable and drinkable, and many at a house party would not be upset by this brew."
"Now this is a good ale. The 750 ml. corked bottle has a classy label, and the ale pours with a sparkling deep red color and a modest dark tan head. The smell is rich with complex fruitiness and a touch of spice (licorice?), and the glass has a lively dance of bubbles that keep popping away throughout. This carbonation is immediately noticeable in the mouth, but the taste is excellent; the initial tang mellows pleasantly, and there is just a little hint of the high alcohol content (8.5%). I'm rapidly becoming a convert to these Belgian-style ales. Not all that expensive, and well worth it."
"The taste is surprisingly sweet, and fruity, and good. The body itself is quite large, which is somewhat masked by the fruity smell. Its quite filling, so I'm glad I didn't purchase the large bottle. This is a treat, and should be served as desert, or as a way to surprise your wine drinking friends."
"Total score: 41 out of 50"
"Impressive. I don't know why I was expecting an alcohol-laden, fruity beer. This is a fine beverage. Pours out to a bizarre mix of amber and brown, we'll call it brownber, in the glass with a monsterous candy-brown head. Smell is that of fruit, prunes, licorice and spice. Taste is sensational. A very nice blend allows the malt to shine on without anything, including the high ABV overpowering it. Light fruit, biscuit and to some extent licorice come through. Very nicely done."
"The verdict? An OUSTANDING brew. Almost my first all 5Â’s. I can't be honest and give it all 5Â’s because IÂ’m still new to these types of brew!"
"It pours a scarlet brown...with a nice creamy tan head...nise is of apples and fruity....Taste begins with the apples and a tich of picy alcohol....but then some wonderful maltiness emerges...a bit like a doppelbock but without the heavy molasses and brown sugar flavors..mouthfeel is creamy and smooth, and a tich fizzy...drinkability is a 5.0...this should be sipped but it's not lasting very long in my glass....I din't think I'd like this one that much, but I am impressed....worthy of it's highly esteemed reputation...."
"Over an hour later, I can still taste it in my mouth. But, I do not revel in the lingering taste. I wish sincerely that I loved this beer, but when I drank it, I felt like a tone-deaf person at the symphony. I want to dance with my beer, not fight with it. It's the beer version of a broad-shouldered red zinfandel wine, or one of those filling-rattling cabernet sauvignons. My senses were definitely engaged, but they did not like it. Too sharp, too harsh, too peppery."
"I am impressed. This is one good beer. I was never a fan of Belgian styles, but tried this one anyway. Nice red color with a fair bit of head that rapidly fades to a thin nut persistant layer with no lacing. Aroma is fruity with alcohol obvious. Taste mimics aroma, vinous and strong. I think I'll give this style a second look, and this beer several more."
"The front is spice and apples! The middle is just a little sour, with malt and more apples. The alcohol shows up a little in the dry, bitter spicy finish. It feels a little thin, but it's a good, interesting beer that's very drinkable for 8.5%. I prefer the Rare Vos."
"Mmmmmm... corked beer! Pours out a dark ruby with a nice head. There is a lot going on in my mouth. Malts are rich and powerful, even a bit fruity. The brew has some sweet to it, also some spice, and quite a bit of all things nice. I enjoy the bottle conditioned beer. Cooperstown really hit a home run here."
"Flavor is strongly malt, fruitiness again, sweetness, moderate carbonation feel, smooth smooth taste and finish. Alcohol provides a little warming effect on the palate and esophagus. What a beer for the price! I'm a broke college student and I can afford a yummy Belgian style! This is most highly recommended."
"I had this with dinner and chocolates, and a couple of things should be noted: Do not have this with spicy foods... it really intensifies the spices! Do accompany this with chocolates, as it complements the flavors quite well."
"Real nice burgundy in color with a great head,with nice Belgian lace left there.Somewhat medicinal in aroma with a little bit of fruit showing up there.Taste was sweet the some chesnut in there as well incredible smooth,the alcohol showed up fast as well.Became stronger as it warmed,about as authentic as you can get,the know what they are doing up there in Cooperstown."
"I've had this beer in the 12 oz. bottle as well as this larger size. Although I didn't take any notes of my prior tasting, this beer seems to be slightly more powerful in the larger bottle, with a dryer finish. Excellent overall, though, no matter the container."
"Too much fizz -- looks and feels like 7-Up with corn syrup. Nice and dark, but doesn't make up for the poor head. Tastes pretty good, but I'm definitely done after having one... no desire to pop another one right away. Sad that the brewery making Hennepin considers this their namesake beer."
"Drinkability: This stuff is like nectar from the gods, but the 8.5 % ABV makes drinking more than one of these a rather bad decision."
"750 ml corked & caged bottle. The cork almost pops out on its own. Minimal effort needed there. Pours a dark brown with red tinges with a full tan head that fades to a carbonation fed layer after a couple of minutes. Aroma is very vinous. Alcohol & fruit on the nose. Smell of red wine. Taste is very much in line with the nose. Vinous, astringent, and pruny, with a grapefruit bitterness. Mouthfell is slightly sticky, carbonation is appropriate for the style. Although I drank the whole bottle, I wouldn't rate this one high on the drinkability scale, not for me anyway. I'll go for the Hennepin again before this one."
"Update: After a few protests from people, I've decided to try this brew again, this time from a known fresh 12 oz. bottle. The head was not a problem on this pour, making me think that my last bottle was contaminated....that was until I tasted it. I still stand by my original review. I think this beer is horrible, yet I will make a few additions. 1)The aroma...I notice this time around that there is a strong tang of toffee and dark candi sugar, though I don't think it is brewed with it. 2)There is a huge pepper note on top of the potent fusels. 3)The lace is nonexistant, so I'm going to take another 0.5 points off for looks. 4)The bittering hops are rubbery AND earthy. 5)It took me 20 minutes to get about 6 oz. of this down, and I already have a mean headache. Ugh. This beer really chaps my ass. Down the sink it goes."
"750 ml. bottle. Oh so very good. Burgundy in color with a nice and plentiful white head. Fruity, with what seems to be raisins(?) prunes(?). Extremely complex and extremely good. Alcoholic tasting. Definitely One that you have to respect. Extremely reasonable price ($4.50 for a 750 ml. bottle). I drank the entire bottle, and would gladly return to it again."
"Burgundy in color with a light brown head. Leaves a bit of lacing. The aromas I get are of alcohol, orange peel, sweet caramel maltiness, and a touch of vanilla. The flavor is spicy, and medicinal. It has a candi sugar sweetness, and fruity fig or date flavors. It is medium in body, alcoholic, with a dry finish. Overall a very complex beer, I would definitely drink this one again."
"I am a reliable consumer of Ommegang's beer. They're local, the price is right, the love is in the beer, and it's fresh. I'm not one for all the plummy oaky-type descriptors, but I agree with the BA's description of cloves and citrus for the Ommegang. Otherwise I just think of beer flavors, and whether the beer is balanced and multi-dimensional, This beer definitely has strength, a malty mouthful of flavor, and character. a good winter beer to drink slowly and savor. I usually pour a couple mouthfuls at a time from a liberal height to set the head off nice, and this beer holds it nice, and the gas in the beer makes it nice and creamy. An excellent blend of texture, assertiveness, and flavor....gotta do these guys the justice of buying a belgian glass....."
"Cheers"
"Pours a rich burgundy, with a light fruity aroma. The taste is sweet grapes, malt, and a small woody hop finish. This strong ale reminded me of a fruit wine without any of the off-taste I find in most barley wines. I'm glad a Belgian of this quality is being made in the US."
"I would love to try the cave aged version of this. I think that it would take away some of the more jagged edges. (Not that there are that many) I am not a huge Dubbel fan but this one is nice!"
"The burgandy reference in the description is what caught my eye. This was a promise I wanted to see furfilled. I was not dissapointed. Very fruitiful with great wine like qualities. The name is alittle hard on the tongue, but everything else is easy on the pallette."
"i love the pop of a cork. slow not vigorous pour into my NBB snifter the color was a brilliant ruby red, much like cranberry juice with a nice thick, small bubble head of light tan. bought 1/2 inch thick which slowly disipated as i drank. the aroma of sourgrapes, and sweet malt burst through the rim. slightly winey taste to it, grape and banana fruit, spicy kick it was medium bodied with no long after taste, just a slight sour note. all in all pretty good, little too sour to drink more than one 750. high carbonation and dry finish"
"Well, the original Ommegang is quite a good dubbel on its own right so when I visited the brewery, i was looking forward to the cave aged Ommegang (Supposedly, they cave aged 1716 bottles in Howe Caverns, but my bottle was numbered 1742). Where the original Ommegang lacks the ""punch"" other Belgian dubbles/dark ales (Maredsous, Chimay Grand Reserve, etc) have, the cave aged version just about equals them. It was much more chocolatey and smooth... almost perfect. It's almost as if this was the beer the Brewery Ommegang was attempting to create instead of the young version. The best way to describe it is it's depth. It makes the young Ommegang look simple in comparison and rivals Belgian dark ales. If for some reason, you don't like the young Ommegang, and you like other Belgian dubbels/dark ales, try to get your hands on the cave aged version. It will surprise you."
"This is another surprising good Belgian style dubbel from the good ole' US of A. I really enjoyed this. The hops are stronger than most of their other styles which is pretty much an automatic plus as far as I am concerned. The blend of hops is smooth with a hidden bit of a bite. The are contrasting flavors in this beer and it leaves the palate clean afterwards. An thick and creamy head that resembles shaving cream almost. If you have not had this one I recommend trying it."
"Ommegang: Wow is this a nice beer. In the big 25 ounce bottle. It pours a very nice looking reddish/brown, with not much head, but what there is is a nice off-white, that leaves a skim of lace. The aroma is much closer to wine than lots and lots of other beers out there on the market. Very fruity with a hint of a rich red wine on the nose. The taste does not stray far from the aroma, with a very prominent fruit flavors with a hint, and a bare hint of yeast/bananas over a crisp, dry wine-ish flavor. Very easy to drink, but watch out for the alcohol warmth, and the heat. Very nice."
"Looks delicious! A deep red that looks brown without backlighting. Should be poured with some vigor for a good-sized head to form. Oh my, what an aroma! Dark and dried fruits galore, raisins, grapes, and grape leaves dominate. Spicy yeast undertones are also present. I think I'm getting slight spicy alcohol as well. I'm noticing a trend with the grape aromas in Brewery Ommegang's beers. That's why I mention grape and not just raisin, it's kind of a mixture of both dried and fresh grapes. I think it's great! Not so wine-like in that it, well, doesn't smell almost like vinegar. Anyway, on to the most anticipated part. The flavor! Surprisingly big hop character here, but not at all too much. That hits first, then spicy yeast comes in. These are the two most noticeable characteristics. Fruitiness here is quite subdued compared to that of the aroma, but still present in a little raisin and plum, especially in the back. Spicy alcohol warms the mouth soon after imbibing is commenced. Maltiness is mostly caramel, but a bit bready in the finish and aftertaste. Leafy character in the quality as well. This is my favorite dubbel so far! Great combination of ingredients. When I get more of this, I'll have to make some Belgian frites (fries) to eat with it. This will make you think that Cooperstown, New York is actually part of Belgium! Highly recommended."
"Redish-brown color, bannana- clove fruity aroma, light foamy head, leaves a thick lace in the glass, full and chewy mouthfeel sweet caramel candy malty flavor, beautiful lasting finish. Hides the alcohol very well, nice.."
"When poured it was a dark hazy brown with a light brown foam. The smell was of hops, malts and citrus with a hint of yeast. All was good until I tasted this beer. Although the taste of malts, citrus (green apples) and a hint of caramel the downer was the sour taste that I got in my mouth and palate. The little bitterness was well balanced that could have made this beer absolutely great, except for that sour finish. If the sour after tase was gone, I would have really like it!"
"I had to rewrite my review for this one. When I had it initially, I was still pretty ""green"" to the craft beer world, and this I thought was the pinnacle of what it can offer. In it's defense, it is absolutely a well crafted brew that I can appreciate, but I just don't like the flavor. It's very heavy on the cherries and raisins, but no interesting malt or yeast flavors for support. I'd skip this one and get Hennepin instead."
"Drinking this beer reminded me a lot of enjoying a fine vintage port with its sweet, yet very complex bouquet and flavors.  It pours a deep copper color with a very lovely thick, off-white colored head.  A very nice looking beer.  The aroma is a sweet fruitiness of plum, raisin, and banana and a touch of molasses.  The taste is complex with notes of sweet fresh fruit that seem to diminish somewhat as the beer warms as it then takes on more of a sweet malty and nutty flavor.  It has a very nice creamy feeling in the mouth and is quite smooth.  I really like this beer.  And, as others have mentioned, for $3.99 for a 750ml, itÂ’s a great buy!"
"Dark, cloudy brown body with an airy, faded khaki head. The aroma is surprisingly whiskey-like. Caramel and toffee ride over a light burn of alcohol. The carbonation is cottony but not too much so. There's a very faint acidity underneath the malt."
"750 ml corked bottle.  Carbonation caused beer to overflow out of bottle upon opening.  Huge head developed in glass.   Dark amber in color.  Aroma of suagary caramel, molasses, and rum cake.  First sip indicates presence of alcohol, peppery flavor, a little on the dry side.  Some burnt and roasted flavors.  A little on the thin side for what I would like out of a dubbel.  Chewing the beer reveals a little banana flavor.  Although I rated them the same I enjoy the aroma a little more than the taste.  $4.22/bottle."
"Pours hazy with a reddish amber color. Decent beige head and nice lace, but you have to pour a little harder to get the head going. Huge malt aroma with lots of different scents that come at you: bubble gum, dark fruit, candy, burnt toffee, licorice, pepper, and spice. Full body with a creamy mouthfeel. Rich flavor that is alot like the aroma. Starts sweet with hints of banana and candy, then comes some licorice and spice. Finishes dry with some alcohol. Tends to be a bit cloying at times and could do with some more balance. Definitly a sipping brew to end the night with."
"This is a great beer.  The bottle alone is cool - makes it look like they have been around alot longer than they have.  The beer is a cherry brown and has a good head and moderate lacing.  The smell and taste bring one word to mind for me - spice.  It was a mix of molasses, nutmeg and lemon, some nuttiness too.  Really, based on taste alone this beer cannot dissappoint.  For an ABV of 8.5% there is no alcohol burn at all.  Very drinkable as well."
"The pour an opaque dark cherry red, the head adequate, but dissipates quickly, leaving skimpy lace. ""Ah! That nose", malt, bubble gummy, sweet, plummish, quite delectable. Front is sweet, malt laden, the top is moderate, the finish parched, alcohol bitter, masterfully hopped, intensely acidic, but a most drinkable beer that deserves a sample. Ranks #224 on my current 1000 beer master list."
"Flavor is amazing, every sip you dicover a new hint of background flavor lurking in the huge malt that dominates. Hints of raisins, molasses, bitter chocolate, banana, yeast, prunes, the list goes on and on. Very big creamy mouthfeel with a good amount of carbonation. This is a great beer all around and an exceptional value, local price is only $3.99 for a 750 ml. magnum. If you haven't tried this beer, I say you should."
"I first had Ommegang about 4 or 5 years ago.  At that time, I thought it was good, but didn't fully appreciate it.  Since then, I've grown to believe that this is one of the best values around.  The beer is beautiful - ruby-brown color with a tan, wispy head that lasts to the bottom of the glass.  The aroma is spice, berries and a hint of alcohol.  Taste is spice and berries, balanced with a terrific malt backbone.  This is a world class beer for a bargain price."
"Pours a hazy dark choccolaty color with a tan 2 finger head. The smell is that of banana, yeast, and alcohol.  The taste starts off with a tad of chocolate and fruit and tapers into a bread-like taste and finishes with a hint of sweet banana.  It is a medium bodied beer that finishes slightly dry.  Pretty good brew but not a session beer.  Cheers!"
"Murky brown color, thick, bubbly tan head. Nice rich smells of ripe fruits, candied apples, bananas and spices. Taste was a very rich deep combination of raosted fruits, plums, berries, yeasty belgian goodness. Nice banana flavor, lots of sweet carmel malts. Finish has a spicy peppery snap to it. Flavors seem to dull as the bottle warms, into a sweet syrupy brown sugar taste with a faint port like taste. Very complex, drinkable and very memorable experience."
"Taste: again bananas, thick sugars, and mild spices present themselves immediately to the tongue. If it ended there I'd be happy, but I keep picking up an annoyingly bitter finish that keeps me from giving this beer as high of rating as I'd like to. Still, at $5 a bottle, I'll be back."
"Overall:  A very complex beer.  Fun to try at different degrees of warmth.  The flavor just won't stand still!  Very tasty."
"Pours burgundy brown with a creamy tan head that hangs around.  Beautiful fruity aroma with hints of chocolate.  Rich, thick malty flavor with a hint of spice; the beer has an alcoholic warmth going down.  Wow!  Now this is a damn beer!   Bought this beer because I heard about it on Beeradvocate.com.  That's why this site exists."
"A great looking Belgian dubbel which looked dark and delicious with a nice creamy head, but I think the high temperature fermentation aromas and flavors seem to overpower. Smells like bananas dipped in chocolate, but the banana is so overwhelming that it smells artificial. The alcohol bite seems to mix well with the banana flavors but it still was hard to drink for me until I had finished about 3/4 of the glass. Then my mouth an tounge were so burnt out that I would not have tasted anything. Not my favorite Ommegang."
"Rich chocolate brown hue with hints of auburn, great depth on the eye, the light beige head easily reached a multiple finger in height, it did not budge. Unyielding, cantankerous head retention, it is a very impressive beer visually. The nose does wonderful things to me, the first time I tried this dandy I was dumbfounded at its complexity and beauty. Bubblegum and marshmallows, alcohol, spice, light toffee-chocolate kisses, earthy-horsey-yeastiness, hints of green apple, and distant but solid maltiness. The potency is modest but the invitation is direct and simple, Â“drink me you fool!Â” The maltiness on the palate is more upfront that I remembered, IÂ’d say this is a good thing. In the middle, on the tongue, is a spicy, apple tartness, followed by toffee and a trace of chocolate. The finish is quickly sweet with dashes of alcohol and spice, which is rubbed out by more chocolate. This beer is sweet on the palate yet dry. Throughout the flavor profile traditional earthy flavors mingle gracefully. This is on of my favorite Â“BelgiumÂ’s,Â” it is amazingly complex and well crafted. Medium-full body, modest carbonation that is natural and pleasing. The mouthfeel is very pleasurable and welcoming. Tremendously drinkable. This is a World Class Belgium Strong Dark Ale, brewed in New York! Highly Recommended!"
"Pours a dark ruby/garnet color with a thick light brown head that slowly settles out and leaves a nice clinging lace.  The smell is extremely malty with some chocolate nuttiness mixed in there as well as some subtle dark fruit presence.  Great creamy maltiness opens up the brew before going through some fruity tones with some banana and possibly some plums in there.  The rbew then mellows quite a bit and goes to a nice smooth and sweet chocolate character which fades into some nuttiness and then finally to a slightly lingering spicy alcohol flavor than warms through and through.  The smoothness of this brew makes it subtle flavors more noticeable and makes the beer that much more drinkable, it is slightly dry for a beer that starts so sweet and not as sticky or cloying as would be expected.  This is a great brew overall."
"This brew is powerfull all over.  I dig the look and aroma.  I am put off by the taste.  Too much for me, but I can appreciate its complexity.  Well worth the effort to try this brew.  Cheers!"
"This beer is a murky looking dark burgandy in color.  A slight chocolate brown head recedes to just an edging within a minute.  The aroma is alcoholic and estery.  Also some wood notes on the nose.  This is a solid tasting Belgian brew.  Very vinous and woody.  Dark fruits play a huge role.  Surprisingly, there is little to note about an alcohol presence.  There's a raw herbalness present also.  Body is pretty light.  Somewhere between light and medium bodied.  Pretty nice brew.  Personally think it is better than the Allagash Dubbel Reserve."
"Hazy, reddish amber in color with a big fluffy head. The aroma is quite distinct: lightly candyish, dryish dark fruit, slightly burnt toffee, light spice with a bit of honey, and maybe, licorice. The carbonation level is high, but very fine, and gives a creamy mouthfeel. The flavor is bold, offering flavors similar to the aroma. It starts with sweetish flavors, honey and caramel, then moves into a darker licorice and spice as it crosses the tongue, finally drying out nicely in the finish. I find this beer (and all of their beers) age nicely, offering a tighter presentation of its flavors at around a year."
"Dark, approaching red, with mild head and sweet candy aroma. This is a very sweet beer, with caramel maltiness really jacked up and flavors of sweet fruit. Hints of banana, licorice, and light spices shuffle up the malty sweetness a bit. At the bottom of the brew is a robust, peppery, hearty dark ale that is truly delectable and lends the authentic dubbel flavor, and makes this a great beer for a meat dinner. However it is not quite strong enough to break out through the candy and fruit qualities to make a truly exceptional beer. A lengthy cellaring time could balance it a little better, but I suspect it would just emphasize the overwhemingly sweet port-like candy qualities. Still a remarkably tasty beer, and an exceptional effort for a US brewer."
"Ommegang abbey ale a Belgium Dubbel, a double fermentation ale, pours with with carbonation to spare. Nothing cloy here, all is in harmony and chanting the mantra... Ommegang... Ommegang... Ommegang..."
"This is a very interesting brew.  The 25oz. bottle exudes a very citrus-spice aroma.  The color is a dark amber, but still translucent.  The forst sip tells you that this is something out of the ordinary.  An earlier poster said this would be THE beer if he only had one to drink for the rest of his life...I would have to try it again to be sure, but I would try it again!  Prost!"
"12 oz capped bottle. Big foaming action as soon as the crown was cracked. Higher levels of carbonation hold the lace together as the hazy maroon amber colour throws a bubble here and there. Alcohol soaked candied fruit, mild clove, hint of anise, caramel and mild citric peel in the aroma. Dry palate with a big crisp high level of carbonation, spicy on the tongue with clove, anise and hints of black pepper. Fruity with ripe tropical fruit, faint metallic earthy flavours bug the taste buds. Powdery yeast in the nearly bone dry finish makes me want to take another sip. Esters are there but not overwhelming. To tell the truth, I prefer this beer out of the corked 750 ml bottle. I think it is slightly more complex from the 12 oz capped bottle."
"Profound belgian-style characteristics.  Very rich and intricate flavor, clove, bannana, caramel, alcohals & bitters.  Dark red-copper, very active carbonation and an aggitated head.  Find the corked bottle.  Drink slowly, deeply, enjoy.  This is a living beer."
"Nirvana!!!!!...Deep dark color, great nose it's there but not overwhelming.  Can feel it as u take a sip and goes down so smooth.  The alcohol is hidden well but it's there, I could feel the buzz after two 22 oz. bottles. If I had to pick one beer to drink for the rest of my life this would be the BEER. Since my state has some very stupid laws I can't get it here, but I will be in search of................CHEERS"
"PS....  You are not drunk (well maybe buzzed) but OMMEGANG is not written in a straight line on the label.."
"Deep reddish-amber color, with a thick, creamy head.  Head stays around and lasts longer than the beer itself!  Rich aroma that reminds me too much of a red wine (I'm not a wine fan).  Notes of malt and yeast keep the smell from being a turn-off.  Taste is a bit better than the aroma, with the wine-like taste less pronounced than the smell.  Nice creamy and oily mouthfeel adds to the experience, but not enough to make this a truly enjoyable brew."
"Semi-transparent cocoa color, relatively mild charge to the head, settles to a thin yellow skin. Deep smell, a little like burgundy with the yeasty sense of warm weather in the country. Very thick and impressive initial taste, notes of raisin and grape. Trace of tartness, but it doesn't run out of control. Textured middle, estery and fluffy. Satisfying and semi-coating mouthfeel, trace of a brandy quality. Great finish, leaves a good impression at the back of the throat. A solid, solid brew from Cooperstown, NY."
"""This is an American Mirco-brew?"" is what you'll be asking yourself after you drink this! This pours with a firm off-white head, great garnet/reddish color, nose is fruity & yeasty...very Belgian. The fruity/yeastiness carries thru the malts in this superb take on a Belgian Abbey ale, finishes nice with a subtle hoppiness & a hint of the alcohol contained within. This is a must-try!"
"Cheers to frank4sail for the sample."
"I am just now discovering Belgian dubbels, so I really do not have much to compare this to. That being said, I really like this beer. Beautiful ruby appearance, with a nice tan head that remains throughout. The smell reminds me of fresh baked brown bread, with some honey and butter on it. The taste is malty sweet, but not overly so. It's like bread in a glass. I really want to explore Belgian dubbels now!"
"The bottles that I have gotten recently have been much heavier on the sweetness, almost cloying and sickning... with heavy toffee and honey notes, leaving an overly sweet taste and a stickyness in your mouth. I am not really pleased with this beer anymore, don't know if it is my tastebuds or the beer, but it really is too sweet for me as of late..."
"It is a bargain compared to real Belgians, but it is lacking a bit of the flavor that keeps me coming back to Belgians.  I found the fruity flavor to be a bit overwhelming.  It does look great, with its dark reddish-brown color.  I'll head for the Belgians when I'm flush and search out the Ommegang at the end of the pay period."
"28"
"Dead-on for the Belgian style.  Very wine-like, and the description ""burgundian"" on the label is apt.  A little fizzy, even for a bottle conditioned beer, but not so much as to be distracting.  Quite fruity, and further toward the sweet end of the scale than average, in a heavy-handed way.  Still, great depth and complexity, overall."
"As good as some of the best Belgian beers, with a unique flavor.  A great expansion of the classic 'dubbel'."
"A superbly rich, fruity, spicy, brew. Sip this one by itself, with Belgian chocolate, or pair with food instead of red wine."
"A bit too yeasty for my palate, with too much of an alcohol presence.  If you want a great American Dubbel, try Flying Fish Dubbel.  Now that beer will knock your socks off!!!"
"Notes: This is a victory for American Belgian Ale lovers. With a price point of about $5 for a 750ml. bottle, as opposed to the typical $7-$12 for imports, it makes for a very affordable treat."
