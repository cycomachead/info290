Insofar as dubbels and their ilk can be considered 'easy' drinking, this one is - definitely a good entry point to the style. A good, solid beer.","interzen","Mar 11, 2015"

The flavor is a bit thin and very sweet.  It is light-medium bodied with a lingering sweetness.  Fairly drinkable though I feel like it could be more substantive, less sweet, and a little heftier.

3.55,-6.6,3.75,3.75,3.5,3.25,3.5,"Pint on tap at National Beer Hall in Calgary. A dark reddish brown with a single finger of light beige frothy head. Aroma is notably sweet and fruity, lots of grape, prune, apple, pear, and peach notes with faint cinnamon and brown sugar. Palate is similarly sweet, with the expected brown spice or cola-like elements ratcheted down in favor of fruit roll up and a caramel sweetness that becomes quite cloying as one proceeds through a full pint. Faintly sour at times but the overarching effect of caramel-drizzled fruitcake is difficult to ignore. Body on the thin side and the carbonation is higher than expected. Should be drier. I do not consider this to be a great dubbel. Some fruitiness is pleasant but should not be the dominant flavor in this style. Avoid in favor of more authentic examples, which are plenty easy to obtain.","CalgaryFMC","Nov 29, 2014"

Pours dark brownish with some purple hues, and a half finger creamy off white head. Aroma is nice, with lots of dark fruits, figs, prunes, brown sugar. Smells very sweet. Flavor is figs and prunes, some brown sugar, and a slightly dirty finish here that lingers a bit unpleasantly. Prickly carbonation, soft mouthfeel otherwise, and relatively smooth down the throat.

I remembered that I thought it was fantastic, but that might have been because I had been forced to drink many truly pedestrian pilsners and lagers on the trip; it seems that at least 95% of establishments there only have Amstel, Heineken and a few other local beers; almost nobody makes an effort to get good beers into the country. This looked, smelled, tasted and felt great and yet somewhat lighter that I would have thought. Still, I was so thankful when I stumbled upon the bar that had it and a few other imports (Blue Moons as well) on tap. A nice drink!","Mdez","Jun 07, 2014"

Even while only 6.5%, it has a strong taste of alcohol. The malts are very well balanced by the hop bitterness - just enough to make it neither too sweet nor too bitter. Warm caramel flavours mingle with the malts. It has a very smooth mouthfeel, not at all dry. Just a hint more carbonation would do some good.

4.02,5.8,3.75,4.25,4,3.75,4,"Had on tap at T.J. Finley's, Bay Shore NY. A good deep brown with head and lacing very ample. It has a wonderfully tart fruity sugar and spice smell, which carries through in the flavor. The brown sugar and raisin taste is balanced by the hops, which evenly accentuate the drinking experience without dominating. The feel is lighter than some others, but that only helps make this a highly drinkable beer. I've had Grimbergen in the bottle as well - either way, solidly recommendable.","angusdegraosta","Feb 03, 2014"

The Mrs. loved it by itself with the sips she had, but I kept wanting to some food to have with it, so not a beer to stand alone and therefore not very drinkable for me in the absence of food. But definitely a very interesting beer overall to pick out all the flavors. Plus from what I read, this one is very close to style, so I have to give it good marks for that.","damndirtyape","Beers"

Scents of grape, slight hints of alcohol and dark fruit. A good nose, quite unique, and very fruity. I like it. Flavors of grape, prune, very slight hints of apple, blackberry and Belgian candy sugar sweetness. Very nice, sweet and complex with a good fruity character. As it warms more prune dominates the taste. It's quite nice, a bit sweet, but overall very good. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with low carbonation. Somewhat standard for a dubbel, maybe a bit low on the carbonation front. Overall it's a very good dubbel, a nice surprise. The fruity flavors are pleasant and it was quite complex in many ways. Worth trying at the very least.","Auraan","Aug 13, 2013"

The aroma is of roasted malts, toffee, and dark fruits. It's the typical dubbel smell, but it is a bit faint compared to some others of the style. The taste is a nice blend of the smells. There are flavors of roasted malts and toffee. The dark fruit taste is there as well. It's definitely a bit bready from the malt. The alcohol is not strong in the flavor, but it should not be at only 6.5%. However, it definitely is there. An unfortunate problem with this beer is it a little watery. The body is light to medium and there is moderate carbonation. It's easy to drink. Overall, this is a good beer. It is not the greatest dubbel I've ever had, but it's certainly worth trying.

It pours a clear sunset russet topped by a finger of khaki foam. The nose comprises sweet caramel, brown sugar, light molasses, sweet figs, and maple syrup. The taste brings in more of the same, keeping that sweet-leaning course very tightly. Kind of odd that I don't get too much of the usual Belgian-ness on the tongue, but this lack doesn't hurt things very much at all. The body is a lithe medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a lightly grainy feel. Overall, a very nice dubbel, one of the sweeter ones I've ever had, but a generally enjoyable drink.","TMoney2591","Nov 26, 2011"

A sip reveals sweet caramel malts, with a hint of that brandy/sherry like aroma coming through in the flavor. It has a pretty clean flavor for a dubbel, but with a tiny amount of sharp sourness, just a hint though. It balances out the sweetness of the malts nicely. It has a full, smooth body with moderate carbonation. Overall quite a pleasant beer, and a bit more straightforward than most dubbels I have tried.

Must not be bottle conditioned as there is no apparent yeast to be found either in suspension or on the bottom of the bottle. The nose is very malt forward, toffee and caramel, a touch of dark fruitiness and yeasty phenols. The flavor echoes the nose with the fruitiness dominating more than I expected, some toffee, mild chocolate, anise and hints of alcohol. The mouthfeel is thinner than I had expected and with a beer as sweet as it is, I was surprised by the very dry finish.

Have seen it around at plenty of places in the states, but just haven't picked it up until now. Great deal by the way at just over ten dollars for a six pack. Pours a rosewood color, with a pillowed white head that lasts. Garnets of a raspberry color are all over the place with this one. Droopy dark fruits dominate the smell. Strawberry, plum, cherry and other berries come to mind. Taste is exceedingly sweet and complex, starting off rather sugary sweet, and then ending on a vinous fruit note. Mouthfeel is ligh to medium. Drinking this one is a breeze, as the alcohol is somewhat low for this style. It more than makes up for it in flavor. All in all I would say that this is a very flamboyant dubbel. Huge on sweetness, with little cuts of complexity here and there. I tend to pair most dubbels with rare red meat, but with this one dessert was the only way to go. The combination of this with a raspberry turnover and vanilla ice cream was delicious. Recommended.","jamie2dope","Beers"

The flavor is nice, similar to the aroma but the fruit comes out much more. Noticeable (not dominant in any way) grape like taste mixed with raisin and a slight tart cherry flavor.

Nose was nice and sweet, with notes of brown sugar and maple syrup, with back notes of raisin and fig. Flavor was dominated with sweet notes of brown sugar and maple, most likely from dark candied sugar in harmony with some special B. Flavor follows the nose in being brown sugary and maple sweet with raisin notes hanging in the back. Light alcohol notes find their way in, but not offensively and well melded. Feel was moderate with a full moderate carbonation. Overall, this was a very nice brew. Aroma and flavors worked well together.

The aroma is malty and sweet but there is a hint of sour fruit at times as well. Medium-bodied with a vinous character. Malt, hops and a touch of alcohol dont seem to mesh well for some reason. The flavor is decent but unbalanced somehow. The finish is fruity and sweet. Overall a decent Dubbel but I feel it could be much better.","Dogbrick","Oct 19, 2004"
3.36,-11.6,4,3,3.5,3,3.5,"Attractive mahogany brown body with a sandy foam head that fades into a grainy satelite photo of a hurricane, eye and all. The aroma and flavor start off slight, with mostly a bit of yeast and toffee, but near the end of the glass, you start picking up a bit of artificial grape candy and at the very end, that grape candy starts to pick up a bit of vinegar. Not bad, but not great either.","aracauna","Oct 10, 2004"

3.51,-7.6,4,3,3.5,3.5,4,"Pours a clear reddish brown. Has an off white head which leaves a beautiful lace. Mild aroma of black pepper, spices, and caramel. Light to medium bodied, it has a chalky, dry mouthfeel. A malty caramel sweetness dominates the flavor. A nice, easy drinking brew .","beerceller99","Aug 31, 2004"
3.26,-14.2,4,3,3,3,4,"Deep russet with a slight haze. Ample, pitted, stiff light tan head leaves dense, coating lace. Aroma dominated by notes of underripe red grape and phenolic red pepper. Secondary hints of baker's chocolate and must. Prosaic aromawise. Prevalent in flavor is a stately plum tartness, complete with astringent tones from the skin. Sweetness, which offers adequate contrast, takes on a soft apple cider nature when combined with the acetaldehyde undertone. As the beer warms, bittersweet dark chocolate tones augment, but remain understated. Rather clean for phenolics, with only trace clove perceived. Lightly bodied and dry, but rather thirst quenching as a result. Finishes with fleeting hints of bread crust and granny smith apple. A rather simple dubbel that grew on me. It's clean in regards to esters and phenols and sits softly on the palate. Middling in flavor, yet highly drinkable.","marc77","Aug 10, 2004"
3.26,-14.2,4,3,3,3,4,"Pours a beautiful light mahogany with an average size frothy, light brown head. Good head retention and lacing. Floral nose that also includes toffee. Initial taste reveals sweetness, toffee, and a nice malty, long finish. At one point I am sure I tasted green table grapes, hmmm. Seems a bit lacking in body for a Dubbel. A bit of well-balanced acidity on the finish. However, it certainly is a drinkable beer and would be a good ""starter"" for those interested in stepping into the world of Belgian beers(perhaps from the Nut Brown realm). Price is nice. Could this be the the Belgians searching for a beer more favorable to the mass palate in the US?","thadkaster","Aug 06, 2004"
3.53,-7.1,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Pours a deep amber with a quickly dissipating head that leaves wonderful lacing. Smell is lightly malty with some fruity elements. Taste is similarly lightly fruity with a tart finish that is ok, but not spectacular. Mouthfeel is fairly light with a good deal of carbonation...decent tart finish. Drinkability is ok, and I might have another ... a decent enough offering for the price.","edchicma","Jul 31, 2004"
4.13,8.7,4.5,4,4,4,4.5,"Very cool bottle 11.2oz with a stained glass eagle on the label. This is a very fine beligan dubbel with a nice price tag. I paid $1.59 each for these and it was well worth it. A raison colored body with very thin head. The taste is wrapped together with sweet and coffee-like finish. The semi-low ABV suits this beer well. This would be an excellent beer for new BAs looking to tap into the Begium brews.","ALESwhatCURESya","Jul 28, 2004"

4.17,9.7,4,4.5,4,4.5,4,"Uncertain murky ruddy-chestnut brown color with a small beige head thats compact and fluffy, minimal lacing coats the glass. Aroma is sultry and cheesy with a yeasty, nearly barnyard, wet old mop-like smell over a largely sweet malt base of darker fruits, toffee, red licorice, and molasses. Quite a interesting nose. That extra little yeasty funk is intrigueing and likeable. Flavors stay malty sweet and tangy with a darker tone of fruity stuff with raisin, prune, and plum, bits of dried chewy apricot and starfruit. Yeasty play of dull spices also adding a bit of wood, mushroom musk, and cheese. Interesting flavor play but it also seemed a bit plain, even with the little nuances being picked up, nothing really stands out. Miraculously subtle, but was missing the fruity snap and character I like to see in a dubble. Something seems off or unbalanced but what is implies an undiscernable impression. Feel is quite smooth, full and creamy, frothy textured, malty with a bit of spice and some slight dullish-like drying. I'd have this again, no doubt, the numbers don't show how much I actually liked it. A bit different and slightly off for what I've come to know as a good dubble for my tastes, but wait...I thought it was good, so I guess it is.","tavernjef","Jul 11, 2004"
4.25,11.8,4,4,4.5,3.5,4.5,"The beer as it sets in the glass a dark amber to brown color with a modest and somewhat creamy head that is light tan in color, the resultant lace a thick and clinging sheet. Nose is caramel, yeasty and sweet, fresh and clean to the senses with the start sweet and loaded with malt, top is moderate in its feel. Finish is benignly acidic, the hops delectable in their spines, quite dry after taste and a great drinking beer, Grimbergen ranks high on my list of Belgian Breweries.","Gusler","Jul 06, 2004"
3.73,-1.8,4.5,4,3.5,4,3.5,"Dark burnt siena color, chill hazed but hard to see if its heavily sedimented. Darker yellowish head of 1/2 an inch for about 40 seconds. Good lace, attractive and crystalline. Aroma has notes of dark fruit, figs, dried apricots, slightly cognac-like. Carbonation is full but understated in a soft sense of small bubbles. Body about shy of medium overall. Flavor shows a slight sense of overdone alcohol, emerges as a slug of yellow raisins and the least bit of semi-sweet chocolate. Better hopped than some Dubbels, relatively bitter in the close for style. The fruity maltiness doesn't have an evolving emerging sense in this one like many of the other Dubbels that I tend to like more.","ADR","Jun 27, 2004"
3.85,1.3,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Is it worth the money? Perhaps, perhaps not...it may be better suited with food that matched it, perhaps some dark desserts or bitter chocolates to counter the sweetness.","koolk","May 18, 2004"

The flavor was much the same - fruity and peppery with a malty character. This was a pretty good beer. Drinks easily and is very much enjoyed.","clvand0","Feb 14, 2004"
4.37,15,4,4.5,4.5,3.5,4.5,"A remarkably easy dubble despite its complexities. Less dry than, say, Duinen or Westmalle. I bet lovers of fruitier red wines would consider this a conversion drink.","marburg","Jan 29, 2004"
4,5.3,4,4,4,4,4,"11.2 oz bottle poured at cellar temperature into a St Bernardus goblet. Appearance is a beautiful cherry mahogany, with a curious, tan head consisting of many sized and textured bubbles. Head eventually receded into sheet lacing. Aroma was raisins, cloves, and fresh baked French bread. Mouthfeel was full bodied, and typical of an abbey dubbel. Taste was very malt based, even for a Belgian. Plums, cherries, raisinbread, bananabread, and some alcohol presence, all combined well for a nice and smooth sipping experience. Finishes smooth and easy.","merlin48","Beers"
3.68,-3.2,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"From an 11.16 oz bottle (where'd the other .04 oz go), it pours a deep copper with a very aggressive tan head that leaves lace down the side of the glass and continues to float at about 1/8"" on top of the beer until the end. The smell has the ripe fruit (raisin and cherry) expected but the alcohol smell is surprisingly strong for a 6.5% beer. A fairly strong metallic flavor is immediately noticeable. The nice fruit flavor works hard to come to the forefront but manages only to lurk in the background, a bit frustratingly. Everything is so close to being right, but it's not quite there.","mickeymac","0"

4.05,6.6,4,4,4,4.5,4,"Color was a rich brown with black and red hues--really pretty color. Head was mountainous, long-lasting, and extremely fragrant. Notes of figs, plums (yea I noticed them too), molasses, and a coffee/chocolate/caramel combo overwhelm the taste buds. All flavors are very individual but blend together nicely. At 6.8 you know your drinking a strong beer but it doesn't knock you on your butt like some other brews (especially if your drinking it at .3 liter incriments). Good beer.","allboutbierge","Aug 19, 2003"

3.82,0.5,3.5,4,3.5,4.5,4,"Grimbergen Dubbel carries a deep brown body with hints of red in the light. The head poured thick, but it dissipated rather quickly. The aroma contains hints of nuts, and a complex fruity nose along with mocha and barley. In the taste detected flavors of anis, and a roasted barley on the palate. Overall it leaves a nice bitterness, but in my opinion something is unbalanced in the flavor. It is enjoybable, but it feels that something is lacking to make it's flavors work better together.","WVbeergeek","Apr 05, 2002"
