"Overall, good dubbel, I'm pretty sure I'd have again. Though a bit different than other dubbels, I get it for the most part."
""
""
""
""
"Initial gush of foam when opening bottle. Pours out reddish brown with very small, oily head. Dried fruits, runes dominate the aroma and taste. Overall sweet nature on this. More fruit and some yeast on the finish."
""
""
""
"The dark flavors of medium carmelazation and ""cold"" coffee are what I expierenced"

"Taste burnt caramel and coffee. The alcohol taste is very pronounced. An ok dubbed"
""
""
"O: A nicely done dubbel. The slight burnt taste is taking it down a little for me, though its unique unto itself and certainly not the worst by Petrus I’ve tasted. Drank in Duncan, SC July 2nd 2014."

"This beer was not all that bad. It had a decent taste to it. This beer was not too heavy or too light, it went down smooth. The taste was not all that bad. It was not too strong or too light. This is really all that I can remember about this beer, it has been so long since I have had this one. But if you have not had it you should try it. The thing that I remember the most about this beer is that I liked it."

"O-This is a pretty simple dubbel and not one that I would go searching for again. The aroma has an off-putting herbal note that did not fit with the rest of the beer and while this low point is not as prevalent in the taste, the beer is just sort of uninspiring. Nice mouthfeel, for what that is worth."

"Poured from a bottle into a beer glass. The head was humongous and lasts a long time. Towards the end of the pour there are lots of dark reddish sediment. You can smell the alcohol and taste it. Very heavy carbonation with a very slight sourness that ends with a bitter finish. Nice dark reddish caramel color. Not a smooth beer to drink. Has a very woody smell and taste to it. Good substance. Overall not a bad beer."
"Overall: Well balanced and complex. Flavor stays around a bit more than others in the Petrus sample pack."
""
"(O)- This is actually a really great Dubbel. Very surprised by the overall review of this one, but I guess I am a bit different on my opinion of it. Not too many dubbels showcase that complex of a fruit flavor profile in recent memory."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Nothing special here. Too bad, it deserved to be more complex."
""
""
""
""

"Overall at 5 dollars a bottle it's not an everyday kind of beer but an exceptional dubbel pick it up!"

"O: OK, but compared poorly to the Val-Dieu Dubbel that preceded it."
""
""
""
""
""
"Aside from a few complaints, it’s an otherwise enjoyable, easy-to-drink dubbel and another well-crafted brew from Petrus."
"This is really an impressive beer. It has a tremendously malty flavor profile. It has an intricate range of flavors that keeps me interested in each sip. There really isn't anything bad to say about this one. It was definitely a good find."

"330 ml bottle, part of a box of six different Petrus beers. ABV 6,5%. Poured into a tulip glass. Two fingers of beige head, with good retention. Body is dark mahogany colour, almost brown. Aroma of malts, chocolate, coffee, a bit of alcohol and clove. Taste is quite sweet, with lots of malts, again some chocolate. No sign of the alcohol on the taste. Very nice. Medium and smooth on the body, light carbonation. Fair amount of dryness on the palate. Very good beer, maybe a bit on the light side but that was not big of a problem."
"This beer was OK to my sidekick, as he was more into strong IPA hops But to me this was pure heaven. This can be scarey brew as I could had no complaints if the brew waitress had served it in a gallon Mug."

"Pours a dark reddish brown with a frothy light brown head. The aroma is a kind of different, it smells tangy with caramel and cherry being dominant. The taste is sweet with lots of caramel, dark fruity flavors and some clove spice. The beer is kind of heavy with low carbonation, creating a syrupy feel. This beer was ok but I enjoy the sour Petrus beers more."
""
""
""
"D - A bit on the sweet side for the style, but it manages to cover all the standard characteristics. There is dark fruit and a touch of spicy character but the sugary notes dominate. The sweetness leaves it feeling a little flabby, but it isn't overly thick and remains relatively drinkable."
""
"330 ml bottle into chalice, 40098 bottle code(?). Pours very hazy dark brown color with a 1-2 finger fairly dense khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Good spotta lacing clings to the glass. Aromas of raisin, prune, caramel, molasses, biscuit, earth, toffee, light cocoa, and light yeast spices. Pretty nice aromas with good balance and complexity; maybe a bit metallic at times. Taste of raisin, caramel, prune, chocolate, molasses, biscuit, earth, toffee, and light yeast spices. Lingering notes of dark fruit, caramel, chocolate, molasses, bread, earth, and yeast spices on the finish for a bit. Good flavor balance and complexity; not as complex as others in the style, but it will do. No cloying flavors at all; slightly dry on the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a fairly creamy and slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with barely any warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a very good Dubbel. Not as complex as some; but is nicely balanced and easy to drink. Definitely enjoyable."

"2nd of the sampler pack. i think it's just OLD STUFF from Total Wine. poured it into the PETRUS sampler pack glass and saw a 1/4"" thick black sediment stuck to the bottom of the bottle. took several rinsings of water to get it out. i dont know if this stuff is old, sat in the sun, very low quality, or just sets out to be a strange brew...."
""
""
"Pours really dark brown, bordering on black. Very little foam atop. Light cola malt smell, some candi sugar. Taste is a full flavorful malt. Loads of cola taste too, backed by a mild hop. Dark cherries too. As the beer warms, more dark fruit surfaces. Low carbonation. Quite good."
"A nice, bold malt-forward beer leaning towards the sweet side of things. Perhaps a tad too sweet, but still tasty."
"O: It's really not BAD, it's just not great. And in a category with tons of amazing competitors."

"The finish just hangs on for too long. If the carbonation could be a little more lively, and that tanginess could hang on a little longer, this would really be a pleasure to drink."
"An interesting dubbel. I'm worried I got an off bottle because no one else mentions it has a tartness in their review. But it actually adds a nice element that probably made the beer for me. Otherwise, the dark fruits weren't nearly forward enough, and there wasn't enough carbonation."
"Dark in color with strong fingers and good head. Malty smell with a strong raisin and hints of floral. Very pleasant to take in. Delicious beer all throughout. Caramel, raisin malty just a good beer to drink. A little flat for a dubbel imo but still good. Thick and has decent carbonation throughout. This is just a good belgian beer and not recently readily available in the US. Take advantage as long as the price range stays competitive."
""
""
"O) Not that great. The taste profile is similar to a beer cola. As for characteristics of a Dubbel this brew contains many of them from the hops to the carbonation."
""
"Overall, this isn't too bad strangely, but it's not like most dubbels I've had. Still unless the words after Petrus are Oud Bruin, I am probably passing on anything else they make."
""
""
""
"If you like typical belgian dark ale / sweet dubbel, that'd be quite good choice for you."

"Very underwhelming dubbel. This mixed gift pack is all over the map, some good, some not..."
"This started out really well, and had the signs this was going to be a phenomenal beer. It's still a very good one, but it ends up feeling a little disappointing just because it promised so much."
"M: Start with some sweetness but changes to a bitter and ending that remains on the tongue and not in the back, it is more chewy than dry."
"Petrus Dubbel Bruin Ale pours a deep, murky mahogany, with some red highlights shining through. There's about a finger and a half of khaki colored head. Head retention and lacing are both barely there... this is one of the less impressive Belgians I've seen. The nose has a little bit of clove, and even less fruit. It's dominated by a rummy, dark sugar sweetness. The flavor brings more of the same, but that sweetness is even a bit more overbearing. There's also a bit of (out of place) bitterness present, and to be honest this beer reminds me more of a cola than a beer. The body is just a touch too full, and the carbonation a little bit dull, but they're both pretty close. I may have to go pick up some Ommegang Abbey Ale or Chimay Rouge soon, because between this and (a soon to be reviewed) St. Vincent's Dubbel, I've had a mini run of the worst dubbels I've ever had."
"O- This is an underrated, acessible dubbel. Probably the easiest drinking dubbel I've had."
"O: not my cup of tea, too sweet, too thin, too sticky"
"Overall: it is a bit candylike for the style, but I find myself rather enjoying this beer. I couldn't drink too many of them, but one is pretty refreshing and tasty."
"Overall, while this ale pours a fairly dark brown, the light, sugary, almost airy flavors prove an unexpected surprise. I can see how some would be turned off by this (expecting more robust, earthy notes), but the flavors work well for me."
"Nose of roasted malt as well as yeast, slightly cellar, which is a think of caramel. Fruits almost non-existent in the nostrils. Brown sugar in the mouth. Slightly sweet, slightly spicy but not as a beautiful way. Finish a little bitter but without much imagination. Dubbel a very classic, nothing transcendent. Basic, too simplistic."
"Overall: Very solid bruin, not the best I have ever had but it is very drinkable and really nice dark fruit flavors. High recommended"
"0: Enjoyable and sweet dubbel, I liked the orange and other fruit tastes as well as the chocolately and caramely malt flavors. If you enjoy finishing your evening with a sweet ""dessert beer", this would definitely do."
"Overall, this is a good beer that starts off strong and has a good variety of fruit. The sweetness hurts the drinkable a bit, but well worth a try."
"This is a pretty good beer and I think is well made for the style."
"O- I think this brew missed the mark a touch for me, I appreciate the different flavors it may just be that it's not what I'm looking for tonight. It's made well, but I need something else there to balance out the prunes."
"Good beer, light enough for year-round drinking yet rich and flavorful."
"t: a medium body, crisping, caramel and toast is so notourius, no bitternes, the alcohol presence is percieved at the very end, dry finish, but long after taste"
"While there's nothing off-putting nor underwhelming about this offering, little stands out by the same measure. The increasing dryness is a plus, happily making the initially overbearing various malt essences but a befuddled memory."
"A little too sweet for my palate but a great beer overall. This is a beer I picture drinking during the Holidays by a warm fire."
"D - very rich full flavours and a great feel make this both physically and mentally stimulating"
"D: Not so much of a traditional Dubbel as much as it is a cross between a Dubbel and an Oud Bruin. A successful hybrid if you ask me."
"D: too sweet for mass consumption. I wish my girlfriend liked beer, as about half a bottle is all I can take."
"Bottle. Opened up and turned my back on this for a second and when I came back to it, it had gushed a little. Hmmm, must be well carbed! Poured into a Petrus tall tulip glass a dark reddish brown color with a big fluffy light tan head that recedes at a good pace leaving some lace behind. The aroma is sweet with a mixture of caramel, molasses, and dark fruit. Light/medium mouthfeel with good carbonation. It's pretty sweet and reminds me of a good caramel apple or fruit covered in caramel. Ever so slight bitterness in the end. Pretty tasty but probably a bit too sweet for me to drink a lot of."
"Notes: Slightly reminiscent of a doppelbock with the slightly tart dark fruit, sweet dark bread, and cocoa. Not a bad beer but nowhere near the best dubbel I have had, or a great representation of the style. I like it, but don't love it."
"single snagged at Peace Street and split with Dad back in Raleigh"
"Drinkability: Another characterful beer in the Petrus range. Good authentic stuff from the Bavik brewery."
"D: The beer is very easy to consume."
"M/D - Medium to medium/full. Excellent carbonation level. Very good mouthfeel. A touch too sweet for my liking, but a passable example comapred to alot of the better, but more expensive examples out there."
"Flavor suffers from the immediate blow off of carbonation. Bit flat and thin in body and feel as a result. Bit of roasted chocolate malt and a light caramel presence. Apparent sweetness becomes somewhat cloying as the carbonation lessens. Overall a bit too sweet in a simple way."
"Overall it is a lower-tier Belgian Dubbel though nothing unspeakably average."
"330mL bottle poured into a chalice. Brown color with an average tan head. Aroma of dark fruits, brown sugar, cloves, and some sourness. This has a sweet & sour flavor with caramel, raisins, lots of sugar, and a sour finish. This beer seems like a cross between a Dubbel and a Flemish Ale. Body was a bit on the thin side. Not very drinkable, I found the taste of this unappealing."
"D - I have two bottles, but this one is too bad; I may not bother with the other one."
"I enjoyed this one. Pours to a dark reddish brown color, head a head that holds up until the end of the glass. Looks almost like coca cola. Tastes a little bit like alcoholic apple juice with a bit of a chocolate character to it. Alcohol is not overwhelming but you can tell it is there. Mouth feel was rather medium. Very drinkable"
"Not bad at all, the Petrus brand covers a host of beer styles, all seem to fit in the 'just above average' category. This one is no exception."
"The sweetness keeps the beer from finishing as dry as I prefer. The weight of the sugars are felt in dramatic fashion. I hope you like your Dubbels sweet."
"OVERALL: A definite let-down. It's too sour and tart for my liking, and doesn't really mesh well with others in the style. The label says it's ""The Key to Heaven," but for me it was a little off-putting. I didn't even feel like finishing this one."
"D - This is a nice dubbel. A little more fruit flavor than most dubbels."
"D: A very easy drinker, yet very flavorful. Goes down almost too easily. Aftertaste in the end is a little much but does not detract. Would definitely drink more of this given the opportunity."
"Pours a dark brown, with a medium tan head. Smells like vinegar. Taste is very tart, vinegar and sourness up front. The middle tastes like your average dubbel. Finish is sour. Mouthfeel is better, somewhat full, average carbonation levels. Drinkability isnt very high, both of the beers I have been able to finish (at different settings) but I dont find them to be particularly pleasant. For the price, a terrible value. I would not buy this again, there are MUCH better dubbels out there."
"D - the flavors are nice but it's so sweet that it seems like a desert beer"
"pours a reddish brown color with average head and lacing the smell is fruit and clove some plum smells a little malt..the taste is typical belgium its fruit forward its plum and apple and melon its different for me but enjoyable to try..the moutfeel is full and fruity and is easy to drink its different for me and ill recommend trying it but i wont buy this one very often but was glad to try something different"
"Interesting reddish brown color with thin tan head. Smell is kind of like grape. Taste is almost like grape soda and spices and maybe a bit of chocolate in the aftertaste. It has a crisp light mouthfeel. Pretty drinkable and its not to heavy alcoholwise making it even more drinkable. Had it with some lasagna."
"Poured a brown body covered by a slowly dieing two-finger tan head that died quickly. Malts are prevelant in the smell along with hints of that Belgian yeast strain and some heavier fruits like orange. Nothing grabs you but this beer is pleasant to drink w/ a smooth, creamy medium-bodied texture that passes easily and finishes clean despite a little stickiness. Good balance but leans more to malts, as chocolate, caramel, hints of vanilla, roasted, and something akin to syrup/molasses hold a slight edge over some floral hops and flavors like orange and fig. This is a beer you can relax with at dinner."
"D- With so many other, more enjoyable beers in the Dubbel style, this is just not in the cards. Too sour for its own good. I tried to enjoy it for what it is, but this just isn't working."
"D: Could easily have had more if it weren't so expensive for a relatively small amount, since it was aged in bourbon barrels for 6-8 months."
"Poured a dark mahogany brown color, reddish-orange hilights when held to the light. Big bubbly head that rose up quickly, then gone just as fast. Aroma has lots of fruit, raisin, currants, plum. Also some caramel sweetness, followed up with some alcohol. Taste is rich and complex. Sugary sweet, dark fruits, with a tart end. Warming alcohol with an oak barrel like finish. Mouthfeel is medium, maybe lighter expected from the smell. Low or no carbonation make it smooth and creamy. Very enjoyable, but alcohol starts to burn is it warms too much."
"Pours a very hazy color between amber and brown, with a kind of thin offwhite head. The head dissapates quickly and leaves just a bit of lacing. The smell is almost entirely like cola, with a bit of whiskey mixed in maybe. The taste is nice and sweet, but not cloying. There isn't an amazing amount of depth, which hurt the score because it's not outstanding, but I just wished that I had this at hand forever. It just has the right amount of sugary sweetness, like candy that doesn't make me sick when I overindulge, and there is not a single off-flavor. Very, very pleasant, and I only regret that I didn't have more to drink. If this sold at American craft prices, it could be a standby beer when I just wanted something malty and sweet. Really worth giving a shot."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability: Finish on this brew is dry like certain red wines. Not Merlot or Cab Sav dry, but still dry, as previously mentioned it has a very vinous character. Feel is medium-light on the palate. Carbonation is very low, which seems to work very nicely for this beer. Aftertaste is long lasting which is nice. This is one that drinks easy, but as to buying it again, it really doesn't drive me to do so. It is an average beer, nothing special, nothing damning. Sure I'll drink the rest of this beer. But its not as if I really look forward to drinking the rest of it, I'll drink the rest of it because it is here, and because I'm still trying to put a finger on what it is about it that intrigues me."
"Drinkability0 Aside from the taste, this is actually a pretty good beer."
"I was pleasantly surprised by this one. Not at all what I was expecting, and I haven't really had enough of the double brown style to really know how to classify. Much sweeter than others, with more up-front fruit notes. Delicious none-the-less. I could definitely have another right now, and will keep my eyes open in the future."
"D: On the whole, this is a well made example of dubbel. Drinkable."
"Drinkability was good. Light body and fairly neutral taste."
"Notes: This is the reason that I enjoy Belgians. Ultimately interesting beers that challenge the palate and provide tastes of a wide range. They also tend to be plenty malty which is much to my liking as well."
"Good beer! Poured wth a nice, big tan head, no lace. Head mostly subsides. Color is a dark brownish amber. Aroma is yeasty, malty, a hint fruity, and sour. Flavor is about the same but also a hint of caramel. Interesting relationship between flavors. Body was a hair thin, but not bad. Decent carbonation. Satisfying. Session beer. Clean."
"I really liked the aroma, very inviting. I wouldn't call the flavour sickly sweet, but it needs a little more alcohol/dryness to perk things up. It's not a bad beer, and certainly worth trying to see a different take on the style... just don't choose it as your first sample of dubbel."
"I enjoyed this one. I am not usually a fan of the style but I could probably get used to this one. A little sweet but nice overall. Medium bodied and the carbonation is refreshing and comforting."
"Pours a dark chestnut brown color with a thin beige head. Aroma is very strong consisting of tart/ sour oakiness and dark fruit. A bit more sour than I had expected. Oak flavor overides the dark fruit and smooth malty flavors. Very dry finish."
"Pours a hazy chocolate brown color with a rather small tan head that settles into a light ring. The aroma is of red wine, prunes, and carob. The taste has a red wine flavor, candied cherries, a touch of soy sauce (odd), and a light roasted malt. Some strong flavors, a bit of a mismatch though. The feel is moderate with strong carbonation, a bit sticky, finishes sweet. Even thougb it is only 6.5%abv there seems to be some alcohol burn. A strong flavored dubbel for sure, though some of the flavors are odd. It is a tad overcarbonated for a dubbel. Average."
"Aggressive pour into standard pint glass creates 3 finger airy head that lasts about 3 minutes. faint lacing thought serving. first smell, sweet grapes slight very pleasent aromas dont overwhelme you, might have served it too cold. first sip malty sweetness grape candy slightly above average mouth fullness carbonation a little tingly on the tongue not bitter at all. swallow no bitter lingering on back of tongue. just above average abv at 6.5 you wouldnt notice it at all. over all very pleasing brew could easily knock back 2-3 of these after that sweetness might become unsettling in the ole stomach. ps 1st effort at review forgive me if it stinks"
"Not too bad; I wouldn't pass up a bottle/ glass if I was offered one again."
"First beer tasted from Petrus and it was quite unique, more sweet and funky than I thought it would be, lack of carbonation also threw me off a bit but it was an interesting brew that kept me guessing, might drink again if I ever see it, worth trying"
"D: I did not find this to be a good beer. I am not sure if that is because I don't like the style or if this is just not that great. The alcohol is not too strong, but the beer it too sugary to be very drinkable. I wouldn't drink this beer again."
"Didn't blow me away, in the good sense or bad. This is an average good beer, meaning I'd have it again, but I just won't rave about it. Others who commented about the head thinning fast are bang on. I drank it from a goblet, the Westmalle one if that detail matters. Seems to smooth as temperature warms though, but still feels ""thin""."
"Not a bad mouthfeel but nothing great. It has a smooth carbonation but the beer's finish is fake. It's too sweet and tastes more like a poor extract homebrew attempt. I have to take away points on the drinkability. This is like cough syrup in a bottle with a cool beer label. I would avoid this one."
"An impressive dubbel from Petrus. I would happily drink this on a regular basis were it more available."
"Smooth, rich, creamy aftertaste. Light effervescence, almost creamy (99%), full-bodied. Highly recommend this beer."
"Poured into a Chimay glass, Petrus Dubbel is fairly dark reddish-tinted brown beer. The foam on top fades pretty quickly, though, leaving a smooth surface. Nose is light though pleasantly fruity, with a tangy edge. Light caramel taste, yeasty fruitiness, acidic finish... it's not well balanced though. I think it'd probably make a good accompaniment for food, but it's just not a very complex or interesting beer for drinking."
"Not the most appealing dubbel I've ever tried, it kind of only meets you halfway and then either gives up or peters out."
"Smooth bodied with a little less than average carbonation, the mouthfeel of this beer lends itself to hearty sips. This isn't my favorite of the style, but it was pleasant tonight."
"D: A touch sweet even for a dubbel but satisfying none the less."
"D: Definitely not one of my favorite dubbels by any means. It's easy to drink but I just really don't want to, lol."
"Not real drinkable in my opinion. If you want a Dubbel there are about 1000 better ones out there."
"Not bad for a dubbel, but other examples are far superior and much more worth seeking."
"Nice full bodied mouthfeel and generous carboation. Fairly drinkable but kind of a sipper even though it's only 6.5%. Definitely pretty enjoyable but I probably won't buy another one for awhile. Too many good beers to drink. Worth it though, get one and taste it."
"11.2 oz bottle copped singly from Gary's in Madison for $3.25... A very impressive appearance with a dark, brown, purple hue with an attractive foamy and frothy head that lingered for a bit... smell was very rich, with obvious figs and prunes pouring through... taste was overly sweet and thick... flavor loaded with sugars, dehydrated fruits, caramel, and strong sugars... very, very sweet taste with a thick and creamy mouthfeel... drinkability took a hit due to the ultra-rich and ultra-thick slightly cloying taste that stuck to the tongue... Like other Petrus brews I've sampled, this one was good but not great... not my favorite depiction of the syle, but not a total waste either... certainly a very sweet, thick, and full-bodied brew... if you like ultra-creamy and rich beers, this one is for you..."
"Alcohol is well-covered. It is tasty and smooth. A nice malty brew."
"This beer pours a dark brown color. The head is one inch in height, and recedes slowly into nice lacing. The aroma is of cherries, plums, and a hint of anise. The taste is of tart cherries, with a hint of caramel. I even think I detect some bretta in there. The mouthfeel is medium-light bodied, with a high level of carbonation. Overall, this is a decent beer. However, there are so many Belgian beers out there which a lot more complex that I can't see myseld drinking this again."
"Pours a hazy orange-ish/ deep amber, with a tan head. In the aroma, a sweet, fruity, maltiness. In the taste, a sweet malt and quite fruity, like apples and white grapes. A medium bodied mouthfeel with a small bite, and a semi-dry fruitiness in the aftertaste. Nice, decent, however nothing really that great about it."
"Dark brown with amber edges. A single finger of light tan head tops this beer and quickly fades to a fine layer. Smells rich and malty, toffey, and dark fruit. Silky in the mouth with more dark fruit, malty sweetness and a boozey finish. Aftertaste could linger longer. My favorite of the Petrus line."
"Pours a dark cloudy brown with a tan head that doesnt stay around long. Molasses nose. Flavor has a strong hint of molasses and a slight bit of caramel as well with a steady and even flavor. Slight touch of malt. Feel is slightly higher than average on the carbonation, and it feels very good with the combo of flavoring against it. Very drinkable. Another from this 6-pack I could down many of in a sitting."
"Taste/mouthfeel - Very soft and sweet flavors; notes of caramelized fruit, nuts and brown sugar. This is sweeter than most dubbels, but it's quite good. Finishes clean with virtually no bitterness in the aftertaste. Medium in body and carbonation."
"D: I like this Ale and will drink it again, and would suggest to anyone. I do worry that if I had more than two at a sitting this could end up really hurting me!"
"Dark mahogany color with a thick orange head. Aroma was a little disappointing; just mildly malty. Taste was fairly sweet compared to some of the past Dubbel's I've tried, but quite pleasant, with a taste of caramel and a hint of acidity. Fairly clean drinking; didn't blow my mind, but quite a tasty brew."
"Overall: Another pedestrian brew from Petrus, this one comes across as a bit overly sweet but otherwise not bad. Worth a try if not for the excessive price ($22/6 pack sampler)."
"($21.99 / 11.2 oz. mixed 6-pack Petrus Sampler)"
"Delaney's always serves their Belgians in proper glassware, and this time was no exception. This lovely dubbel was served in a tall, long stemmed Petrus glass. It's deep brown color, modest head and specks of yeast made for an interesting introduction. The aroma was of sweet candied sugar, with molasses and a hint of malt. Aged prunes and like fruit was also clearly evident. The taste was bursting with sweet raisens and candied sugar balanced just perfectly. The mouthfeel was full and sweet. Just a solid dubbel and one I will be sure to revisit either in bottle or tap. Thisis one smooth Belgian and very worth savoring."
"D- This beer is subtle but still complex. This is a good session beer if you like wild ales but can't drink a monster tart beer. I could have several of these and the subtle notes make we want to taste more of them."
"Pretty good stuff...maybe too sweet to have more than a glass."
"D - This would make a very good after-dinner drink, but for the most part, I don't know if I'd come back. A bit too sweet for my palate."
"I dont have any personal vendetta against Petrus, Ive just had some of the worst beers Ive ever tried and Ive been drinking good beer for 15 years."
"Taste is caramellic, molasses and candi sugar with some sour notes. The yeast appears to be quite funky and not very fresh. I found this taste in some lambics and I did not like it there either. It certainly does not fit in a dubbel IMO. Aftertaste is sweet, but the beer wasn't sweet but dry."
"Had in Pittsburgh after trying the Petrus Blonde. The beer poured with a huge head, similar to the blonde but obviously a dark brown color. The aroma was sweet and a little rasiny/figgy, and the flavor was sweet and dark fruity but could have been a little richer. It was pretty good nonetheless, but not in the top 10 dubbels-of-all-time list."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, smooth, mildly sweet, and satisfying."
"Other than Aged Pale Ale, which I think is their finest creation, I've never really been wowed by beer from this brewery. Dubbel Bruin is decent and is easy to drink, but compared to the world's finest versions, its amateurish at best."
"-Oelergud"
"This was much better than the Allagash Dubbel I recently had, maybe a little sweet for some tastes."
"A fair dubbel that gave me no real problems with drinking the bottle."
"I enjoyed this one. Not a bad beer at all for my 500th review (has it been that many already? ..wow)"
"This is a great Dubbel, but rather different than Trappist Dubbels I have had. I am not sure if the wortiness is true to style but it was very unusual and strangely delicious. I think this is a must try even though it is not a Trappist or Abby Dubbel."
"Notes: The metallic smell was hard to get over but where the rubber hits the road this brew holds up well. The petrus line from Bavik has been hit or miss to me and this one is somewhere in the middle. Such a magnificent style that if I had never had a dubbel before I'd be impressed. Since that is not the case this one stacks up to be about average."
"Server on draft in Petrus chalice, the Dubbel was dark brown with a very small white head which quickly dissipated and left no lace. The was no noticeable aroma. The taste is rather pleasant however, one of my favorite Dubbel's. It was sweet, malty and vinous, with notes of toffee and brown sugar and a slight bite, not from the alcohol I think but the minerals. The mouthfeel was rich and a bit syrupy from all the malt, but the complexity from the water and yeast made it relatively drinkable."
"Drinkability: Decent, but cetainly not stellar; would benefit from a more balanced profile"
"This dubbel pours a medium brown that looks teasingly translucent. Smallish head that fades to a grey dusting. Nose is quite nice -- juicy, fruity and sweet. Candi sugar in the nose, along with some raisins and granny smith apples. Initially acidic on the tongue, with fruit esters of apples coming out. Turns sweet at the mid-palate, with slightly caramelized candi sugar the focus. Dry finish. Mouthfeel is quite varied -- acidic at first, slick next, but never too heavy. Overall, this was a very nice, drinkable Belgian dubbel. Not as heavy as many of the abbey versions, but flavorful and interesting nonetheless."
"Don't quite like this one from Petrus but I will try again."
"Smooth mouthfeel coupled with an intensely sweet ripe plum flavor characteristic. As it warms, a root/ginger beer flavor emerges. Not overly complex as one would expect from a Belgian, but enjoyable nonetheless."
"What a disgusting beer this is. It's nowhere close to being a dubbel. Way too sweet and obviously flavored with saccharin. Yeast choice is all wrong. A mistake. Stay away. Blech, down the drain this goes."
"Drinkability & Notes  Not digestible as the Belgians would say, a bit too sweet for me. A nice summer dubbel, relatively light in alcohol with a smooth flavor that lacks the complexity of the archetypes of the style."
"D = Good. Easily drink one or two a session. More would be pushing it."
"Fire up the BBQ and let's braise some ribs!"
"A good brew that would be nice as an after dinner sipper. Might be a bit too sweet for some folks."
"Drinkability and Overall: Half of this beer is delicious, half is terrible. Overall, the terrible half prevails, turning this into a cloying, overly sweet, unbalanced brew. PASS."
"Pours out nicely with a big head that falls into a good strong lacing. Smells different, and therefore very good, from what I've reviewed lately. I always enjoy a new taste. It's full flavored and a little spicy with something I can't put my finger on. Mouthfeel is very good and the aftertaste is slightly sour in a good way. I would definetly have more of these."
"Nothing outstanding here but this was a very solid brew. Funny how I have picked up a lot of Petrus bottles to date yet I never seem to see this one. Draft version was good and well worth trying, if a little too sweet at times."
"This beer came a very dark amber with slight brown and burgundy highlights. The head was huge, uneven and a dark tan. Smelled of sugary sweet malts and a sweet and mildly tart over ripe fruit. Tasted clean and light with a light malt and candy sweetness that collapses into a powdery dry cherry. The cherry and a dry chocolate nip at the edges of my tongue in the finish. The mouth feel is light to medium bodied with a syrupy feel to it along with a light tingly carbonation."
"I gave this a high drinkability, because despite its almost overpowering sweet, syrupy character this comes off almost a desert drink, and I found myself having no problem in drinking it."
"The beer disembarks the 330ml brown bottle a clear deep brown with a perpetual frothy tan head that lingers on, but after its depletion to nothingness, the residual lace forms a tight skirt upon the glass. Nose is musky, hints of caramel with a nice malt sweetness; a fine sniffer to be sure, start is somewhat sweet with a pleasing grain presence, top is fair to middling in its feel. Finish is benignly acidic, the hops present and pleasing, the aftertaste dry and a fine beer to end the evening with."
"A dark brown color with loads of foam that just sits there indefinitely. When the head begins to deflate, it leaves behind excellent lacing. Aromas of caramelized sugar, malt, and candy. The taste is refreshing and engaging with a fruit flavor that works into both the sweetness and the bitterness of the beer. A very delicate beer in that all of the textures and flavors collaborate with one another. Impressive beer for its lack of overpowering, dominating characteristics. Very drinkable, especially with a lower ABV for this style. Quite thin in my mouth."
"BB 14-07-07. Good presentation with nice welllasting thick yellowish head. Clear darkbrown beer make it a good presentation. Nose is dark candy, carramellic malty and a slight hint of roast. Good and full yeastester arome completes this quiet good smell. Taste is far oversweetened, dark candied, carramellic, alcoholic maltjuice. No this is certainly not my taste and for mouthfeel is to say that my mouth shrinked together while drinking this. For people who like it sweet probably highly enjoyable but less to me."
