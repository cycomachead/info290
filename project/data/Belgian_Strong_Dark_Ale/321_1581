4,0.5,4,4,4,4,4,"Depending on how cold you keep your fridge, this needs a few to warm up a little to let all the goodness open up. Pours a dark, murky brown with a fizzy tan head that burns off quickly. There is no lacing. The aroma starts out a little tight, with some pleasant dark fruit notes but really comes out a little warmer with some nice caramel notes and more robust fruits. The body has a nice weight, not heavy or thin and a smooth finish.","delta490","Mar 27, 2015"

APPEARANCE: dark purple body; soft, wispy off-white head that thins out to an uneven, varied density; nice, intricate lacing... AROMA: immediate prune and apple; hops are aromatic and yeast adds some funk to an otherwise sweet malt... PALATE: thick, creamy, a bit chewy, and warming; easy-drinking and dry at the finish; a fleet, discrete presence--good, solid brown ale base... TASTE: grape and prune are the dominant flavors; smoky malt surprises, as does the lack of alcohol; rather flat at the finish... OVERALLL: a classy, slightly subdued version of tits usual and Christmas varieties; situation is key--introduced this at Thanksgiving a decade ago, but it didn't pair with the main courses well; as a nightcap, it can open with its complexity or close with its strength....","dacrza1","Jun 11, 2014"

Very enjoyable right now, sweetness has subsided into a very relaxed melange of brown Belgian goodness. Nary a breath of alcohol and pure delicate quench on the back of the tongue.

I would venture a loose comparison to a Belgian homage to Traquair House Ale, mostly in its expression of dark-sugar flavors - not nearly a parallel in overall composition... the proprietary Achouffe yeast factors relatively moderately into its taste, for better or worse","Bouleboubier","Mar 31, 2014"

In any event, this is certainly a well-attenuated and thin-bodied dark ale that does indeed capture some Scottish flavor elements, albeit with a decidedly Belgian profile nonetheless. A dark reddish brown brew, maybe leaning towards the red, with a moderate amount of light tan head and an aroma that is equal parts fruity esters, spicy medicinal phenols, and sweet caramel or toffee along with a vinous wine or cider-like note. Nice balance between the caramel elements and Belgian spice although I am less wild about the cidery component. Palate largely reflects this, such that I initially get some apple and pear fruit followed by clove spice, golden raisin, musty white peppercorns, faint molasses and bandage-like phenols, and perhaps a whiff of citrus rind. Rather dry, powdery mouthfeel and this brew just screams thinned down with a healthy sugar addition to the kettle. Some alcohol is apparent but not over the top in this regard. Really my main issue is the ultra-thin body and correspondingly airy mouthfeel but the flavor is solid.","CalgaryFMC","Mar 20, 2014"

And so, the beer is not as cloying as a Scotch ale can be. Whether that's a good thing is a matter for debate. One can also argue the merits of the beer's texture, which is noticeably more prickly than creamy. We can agree, however, that McChouffe is wee light, and that such a brew has its place.

Distinctly Belgian all the way. Brown bread, brown sugar, light spice, a bit of toffee and caramels. Relatively light bodied and fairly sweet. Moderate carbonation with only a touch of alcohol. A really solid beer. A nice beer to revisit now and then.","Huhzubendah","Jan 31, 2013"

There is also a bit of boozeyness that creeps through on the finish. Mouthfeel is big and rich. Although this is a nice BSDA, its a bit unbalanced in comparison to Chouffe's other offerings and doesnt really display the same great complexity.

Some nice soapy lacing on the glass. Aromas of caramel, plum, molasses, raisin, pepper, nuttiness, light chocolate, and yeast spices. Fairly nice and well balanced aromas with good strength. Taste of toffee, molasses, plum, raisin, biscuit, pepper, chocolate, dark candi sugar, nuttiness, and yeast spices. Lingering notes of molasses, caramel, dark fruit, pepper, chocolate, and yeast spices on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance of flavors. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a fairly creamy and slightly slick mouthfeel. Very smooth to drink for 8%. Alcohol is well hidden with only a slight warming after the finish.

4.38,10.1,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Mc Chouffe is a cloudy raspberry brown ale with clumps of yeast swirling around in it. It has a huge head that leaves great lacy foam on the glass. Foam started blasting from the bottle after I opened it. There are herbs and bread in the aroma, along with something tropical like melon and a note of phenol. It's pretty full bodied and super soft with a dry, chewy finish. It's almost a hint sweet with a spicy herbal bitterness. The malt is thick, like caramel. It tastes earthy and perhaps slightly resiny. The slight sweetness stays steady as the juniper-like bitterness grows. Both flavors linger for a while after the swallow. There's almost a hint of anise and some sort of herbal tea. This is a real treat to drink: Well balanced, flavorful and interesting.","yesyouam","Mar 27, 2012"

The taste brings in more of the same, though the toffee seems to flatten out a bit and cover everything else in a fine veneer of itself. It all comes out spicily bland, but in a good way...if that makes any sense... The body is a light-leaning medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a sorta/kinda dry finish.

What a great combination -- the spices and cloves of a good Belgian yeast like the Chouffe strain go so well with the lightly-kilned aromatics of a Scottish ale. This beer is light on the hops, which are floral and mild, and heavy on the light and sweet caramel flavor that comes from dark caramelized sucrose. Like a good wee heavy, you are simultaneously overwhelmed by malty sweetness and looking forward to your next sip. The dark caramel malts and caramelized sugar are nearly indistinguishable, with flavors of toffee, rum, and raisins. The aromatic malts and yeast give cloves, dark spices, and a nice earthiness coming from either yeast or dry-kilned malts. The body is on the lighter side of medium due to always-appreciated sugar additions, and the color is dark and rich without being black or opaque. The head is fluffy and dense like frosting on a desert. It's the contradiction between intense flavors, sweetness, and the surprisingly light (but not dry) finish that makes the beer so damn drinkable.

Earthy colors with thick head that stays around for a while, what a good brown ale should look like. Not too overpowering of a smell but rather a soothing cocoa bean aroma. Mmmm, smooth, malty, coffee roast with a touch of chocolate spice for an aftertaste and I am transported to Belgium hanging out with midgets. No alcoholic bite to be found despite the 8.0% ABV, it is masked behind the deep flavors that coat the tongue. A tasty Belgian mudslide that's enjoyable any time of year.","JRed","Aug 13, 2008"

The smell is of bready malt, some typical Belgian spice/yeast aroma. Has a slightly dark fruit scent as well. The taste starts off with an earthy Beligan yeast flavor, there is a hint of candi sugar sweetness, not much of a fruity flavor as there is a woody flavor. Rounds out nicely with a slighty bitter end. The feel is moderate with tingly carbonation and finishes well balanced. This doesn't feel like a big beer at all, quite sessionable.

The smell has that earthy Belgian yeast with brown sugar, graham cracker and a little caramel. Nicely carbonated, the mouth feel is light and effervescent. The taste is interesting as well. I like the association to a Scottish Abbey Ale. The flavors are similar to the aroma. There is a light after taste, almost like a cola, with the spicy note of a Scotch Style that lingers nicely.

The aromas where very enticing, molasses, brown sugar, nuts and dark fruit to name as many as I can remember. The taste was similar to the aromas that where mentioned along with a nice hop taste that adds to the pallet.

So is the smell, being entirely sweet malty caramel. The taste begins the same way, albeit more intensely, and accompanied by roastiness and hints of cocoa. It then moves to a slight, short biscuit phase. ending on a juicy-sweet note, which is slightly citric. In the mouth, it's medium-thick, and carbonated enough to be nice and tingly.

A style-typical dark malt color with browns, rubies, mohogany colors that swirl around a mild haze. Firm and fluffy carbonation that deserves a '5'. Smells candy sweet and fruity fresh with an underlying berry tartness, hoppy spiciness, and vineous alcohol. Flavors unlock the same character but with more power that the aroma suggests. Fruity with dates, figs, grapes, blackberries, and a hint of raisons. Sweet with a light molassas, cotton-candy, candied sugar flavor. Hopped / spiced with a peppery, earthy, musky, nutty character. Throw in a bit of red-wine just for good measure. The beer feels full, but light (carbonated) in the mouth. Mildly prickling and numbing. Leaves the mouth a bit sticky sweet, but not off-putting.

This smelled like it was going to be a yeasty delight. The taste came through with lots of dark fruity flavors. Incredibly rich but not bitey. The mouthfeel is quite full; Thick and slick.

Foamy khaki head with loosely knit bubbles, subsided to a blanket of frost in about 60 seconds. The smell was exceptionally fruity and malty. Smelled delicious. Plenty of stewed fruits and raisins. Then came the taste. It was decent, I suppose. Not very complex, and no one flavour profile really captivated me. I thought it was rather boring and simply an average Belgian at best. I also thought it had a bit too much carbonation. The mouthfeel wasn't smooth and seamless, as I had expected. Instead, it was abrasive and almost offensively carbonated.

Soft backbone of Belgian yeast, on first thought this is a bruin. Some notes of toffee. No alcohol, some warming. Medium lingering. Not positive I taste Scotch notes, this is far too light. There is however some gentle liquere like notes as it warms. A very sweet brew. Perhaps some Belgian sugar in there? A gentle balance overall and very enjoyable. Against others similar to it, this beer sadly doesn't offer as much to celebrate - not the same level of strength, depth, or complexity.

Aroma of some lightly sweet, medium-bodied malt, tasty Chouffe Belgian yeast, and an underlying clove spiciness. Palate features the dueling influences of some rich, lightly roasted caramel malt, a bit of Euro hops, and the somewhat overpowering yeast. Notes of clove, white pepper, biscuit, and a touch of caramel. Massive alcohol presence on the finish leads to a nice warming sensation all the way down the throat. Nice, medium body is not too fizzy and conveys the flavor quite well. I was, um, forced to finish the 750 bottle by myself. Not like it was punishment.","ElGordo","Apr 22, 2006"

The nose is inviting, as its fresh, bready, with a spicy pepperness. The body is medium with a spicy and tad prickly mouthfeel. There is a very fresh feel to the beer. Among the mingling flavors are cloves, nuttiness, and saaz(?) hops. Overall, a very earthen and handcrafted feel, which is always appreciated.

This beer would be highly drinkable in a low-alcohol version that could be consumed in many pints over the course of an evening. As a high-alcohol beer, it has to lose some points in my mind... there's no reason to choose McChouffe over some other sumptuous Belgian beers.","geexploitation","Jan 22, 2006"

However the taste is a little less expressive. It's nice to see some subtelty now and then in beer, but I found this beer to be a little uninteresting. Yeah, it had some nice candy sugar qualities and some nice grassy hop tastes, and even some spices, but it didn't all come together as well as it could have. A tad light and thin in the mouthfeel.

Not as complex as most of the Belgian ales I've been trying, but goes down very easily and would be great with a meal.","cubedbee","May 18, 2005"
4.3,8,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"McChouffe, no matter what style one chooses to call it, is a wonderful dark ale by brewers who clearly know how to brew great beer.

A fine achievement.","BuckeyeNation","Apr 19, 2005"

Little disappointed in the visual experience. The second pour was a bit cloudier, but the head was thinner. The nose features mild apricot and malt. The mouth is very prickly and quite light when cold, but getting heavier as the beer warmed. The tastebuds first experience a mild, soft-spoken sensation that hides the alcoho9l content extremely well. A fine bready malt underlies a light fruity bouquet of plum and grape - more sweet than sour, but not very sweet, either - just present. The malt became much more obvious as the brew warmed, essentially burying the fruit by the last sip of the second pour. Hops are also present, adding a nice dryness and a hint of bitter in the finish. I could see enjoying this more than once, as the complexity and taste change so radically with temperature variations. Definitely worth more than just a dabble.","Globetrotter","Mar 22, 2005"

The nose has a nice yeasty bread character along with ribbon candy from the malt and a mild hop flower aroma. The taste has the bread character present in the aroma along with malt sweetness. The hops do not carry over like I had expected. There is more fruit in the flavor profile on the finish. The mouth feel is fuller, smoother than I caught from the draft version.

Taste starts off a bit fruity sweet with various fruit flavors melding together. There is a decent bit of spiciness to it and some hop bitterness. Finishes on a spicy sweet note that lingers a bit.

4.44,11.6,4,5,4.5,4,4,"Tasted at cellar temperature, as close to 10 to 12 degrees as I could get it, as the bottle suggests. Popping the cap of the 750 ml bottle, I first smelt a soft vermouth/sake aroma from the bottle. Unique labelling with some sort of elf or dwarf holding a stock of grain. In the chaliced glass, this beer is extraordinary. Rich chestnut hues with dark rosewood, on the verge of ruby. The head is creamy, sometimes fizzy, tight, and went quickly to a fine layer of light brown/cream. Mix of large and fine sized bubbles in the viscous lacing. The aroma is everything a good brune Belgian should be. Dusty smoked malt, complemented with sufficient but not overpowering yeast, and musty fruits. Freshly baked bread, and extreme sweetness at first, with the head still at its fullest. Grape juice, slight salmon smells, soya sauce, and numerous other aromas make this an extremely complex-smelling beer. Some definite wood in the smell, dust, and strong malt dominance, almost like a fine scotch. Dare I say it, I sense the peatiness of some Island Scotches. There is soap, caramel, roast, vanilla, salty water, and an aroma I cannot fully describe which is new to me. Grassy, spicy hops are there in the background as well. The aroma is extremely appetising, with great complexity, but at the same time it is not off-putting in the least; it is accessible. The taste is all chewy, delicious malt on the front of the tongue. Smooth on the middle, with tart characteristics appearing; nuts, more grainy malt, and dry bread. The hops are detectable, but this is by far a malt offering, with sour lactose in the finish. Some muskiness, some treacle, and definite grist, this is a delightfully full and grainy drink. You can taste the grain as if it were fresh from the stock. Limited carbonation, making this a smooth, creamy beer. On the tongue it seems to turn to foam immediately. Belying its 8%, this beer could pass for a 5 or less. No excessively strong taste means this is an easily quaffable brew, but do not think for a moment that it lacks complexity. As long as supply lasts here, I will be buying these regularly. I imagine it would pair perfectly with a cheese-pasta dish.","Cwrw","Dec 09, 2004"
3.53,-11.3,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Attempted to pour some of this brune into the aforementioned glass, and was assaulted by a massive creamy off-white head. When it subsided I managed to get a bit more of the ale in. Very impressive head and head retention, plus the lacing is rather intense. The colour of the body is a cloudy deep mahogany, very inviting earthy/wood hue. Light effervescent nose, I'm picking up some sweet preserved fruit and some nuttiness, some yeasty phenols, and a light detergent character that dances in and out of the fruitiness. Only after it warms a great deal can some malt be discerned. The alcohol can be immediately tasted upon the first sip, and has a warming effect on the palate. There is also the presence of vodka preserved dried fruit, some earthy spiciness to the malt in the middle, and a light fruit finish that gets spicier on the aftertaste. There is a lighter mouthfeel than the alcohol content would bely, but it is also very smooth as well, no real bite to it, or burn. A drinkable brune, but pretty one-dimensional flavour-wise, I wish it had come in a smaller bottle to sample. It's not something I'd buy on a regular basis, but I'm sure I can put that tulip glass to some good use anyways.","IronDjinn","Nov 28, 2004"

Back when he used to make wine, my dad once threw a bunch of stuff at random into the bin just for the hell of it - grapes, plums, pears, etc. It ended up being a fantastic dessert wine, but of course he could never duplicate the recipe. Mix some of that with caramel malt and caky yeast, mellow it down a few notches and you have the McChouffe.

Caramel is the main flavor I get but it does not have staying power either. Also slight woodyness to it along with a bittersweet chocolate flavor. But all of those flavors are quite weak and don't mesh together. Just one at a time. Strong alcohol flavor comes in the middle and lingers until the finish and beyond. Yeast is not really noticeable (weird). The bottle says for this to be consumed before end of 2006.

Mouthfeel is thick and rich, medium carbonation. Taste is the surprise here. If I was rating this one blind, I would have guessed it to be an excellent English Bitter, or ESB. Lots of walnut nuttiness, toffee, and biscuit. Approaching room temperature, a plethora of sensations delight the palate. Fruits of all kinds, spices, and even florals seem to be here. Alcohol is cleverly hidden away by all the pleasant qualities going on. Carbonation lasts all the way through, and the finish is dry, with a hint of fruity butternut.

The head did fade quickly to half of that size, the remainder hung around awhile, it stayed soapy throughout consumption. However, it did not lace well. The nose was intriguing, very airy with pepper underneath, which was quickly followed by Saaz hops spiciness, distant maltiness. The bouquet needed more pizzazz thankfully the palate does not! Damn that first sip was great! Much hoppier than Id ever guess, a pleasant surprise, spicy Saaz upfront, hot and tasty! In the middle a note of flowery-pepper emerges, as does a hint of clove but it gets drowned out by a dry maltiness. I cant say the finish impresses me much, forgettable actually. As it warms the sweetness increases, it is not cloying or tacky but noticeable, yeah, it is a good addition, just subtle enough. The 8.5% abv escapes detection, a marvelous accomplishment. The taste is unique enough to warrant a visit, lovely and complex. The body is medium; carbonation is firm, but not forced.

It didnt hold up nearly as well after tasting over 200+ Belgian ales over the course of the last year, but it was still a good beer and a joy to consume. I dropped most of my ratings by half points but still would recommend.","RoyalT","Sep 23, 2003"
4.3,8,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"It pours a dark brown with an offwhite head. Most of the head disappears after a while but it keeps some right around the edge. It has an estery smell, very fruity and also some caramel. I can pick up on the Belgian candy sugar as well. Tastes like caramel, a little chocolate, & alcohol. It is sweet but not overly. The taste is very complex. It starts out more chocolately and becomes more fruity towards the middle and into the aftertaste. The mouthfeel is just right. Moderate carbonation, though the head on mine didn't stay to long. I might of had a soapy glass. Overall a damn fine Belgian Ale.","Brian700","Sep 06, 2003"

4.53,13.8,4.5,4,5,4,4.5,"Appearance: dark red/amber color, a nice full rocky, tan head--lively and effervescent. Good head retention and a resilient lace. Aroma: spicy, cloves, and alcohol. The taste is complex: creamy and somewhat sweet, but not overpowering. The taste seems to change and develop more character in the middle and toward the finish. Very drinkable beer.","SeanChouffe","Aug 12, 2003"
4.18,5,4.5,4,4,4.5,4.5,"Its hazy, ruddy-brown body appears as a deep amber when held to the light; and its tall, creamy head of light-tan foam holds exceptionally well and leaves sheets of sticky lace at the outset of the glass. Delicate fruit greets you in the nose with soft prune, delicate raisin, light summer berries; and a touch of mild toffee and caramel to round it out. Some hops appear in the background but never come forward enough to be recognized. Its very fine, natural carbonation caresses the tongue with a thousand soft prickles before warming to become lightly creamy, and then simply sliding away - yet it's medium/light bodied still leaves a memory. Very nice! All of the fruit found in the nose finds its way into the flavor with the addition of a light, milk-chocolate note and some spicy hop flavor. And although it appears quite straight-forward at first, some acetaldehyde and phenolic notes awaken as it warms; the alcohol becomes more apparent, and it becomes dryer in a finish that lingers with some scortched-caramel and dark-fruit sweetness. It's very well balanced and none of it's components (fruitiness, caramel sweetness, alcohol, hop flavor) ever run out of bounds. Nicely drinkable despite it's solid 8.5% abv; and rich without becoming at all cloying - this is an impressive Belgian brew that defies categorization. Well worth trying!","NeroFiddled","Aug 12, 2003"
3.78,-5,4.5,4,4,2.5,3.5,"Nonetheless, overall this is a very drinkable beer. Certainly is one I'd try again. This work work well for those winter holidays with similarly spiced food.","TAMU99","Aug 12, 2003"
3.68,-7.5,4,3.5,3.5,3,4.5,"This is kind of a run of the mill Scotch ale. Dark, cloudy reddish brown with a nice glow. The slightly tan head is thick after the pour but fades completely although slowly. A mild bit of peat, wood. Thin but not bad. Not rich enough or enough complex malt to be a good scotch, but it's a easy drinking scotch ale that should go well with mild beef dishes.","aracauna","Jul 28, 2003"
3.32,-16.6,5,3,3.5,2,3.5,"When this beer was poured into my glass, it had a large tan head with fine-small sized bubbles that was fully diminishing. The body was mostly clear with lively carbonation observed. The nose was that of alcohol and some mild clove. The flavor was spicy and malty and the mouthfeel was tingly along with a burning sensation as it is swallowed.","hotstuff","Jul 22, 2003"
4.08,2.5,4.5,4,4,4.5,4,"A nice dark honey-toned amber with a huge head and beautiful carbonation, a good looking brew. Apples is what is smelled at first, but that was quickly taken over by the malts and hints of spice. The dark amber translates into the taste, the sweet malt and then the warmth of the alcohol, finishing with a metallic like bite. Spices dance around in the mouth, perhaps cinnamon and a touch of nutmeg. The alcohol does let you know it is there in the taste. It is a smooth beer and finishing with a crisp finish.","BigHead","May 31, 2003"
4.35,9.3,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"This dark ale poured a hazy iced-tea brown with rich, tall, tan foam that settled and did not leave much lace, if any. The smell was nice: apples, malt, biscuity aroma, citrus, and a flowery smell (perhaps the bog myrtle that is listed as an ingredient?). The taste was very good: smooth, caramel malt, apples, a bit of candy sugarl, a biscuity taste, a hint of alcohol, a slight hint of hops, and a trace of bananas. The mouthfeel was smooth and creamy, and slightly sweet but clean. This ale had aged well and was very mellow and very pleasant to drink leisurely.","UncleJimbo","Mar 27, 2003"
4.18,5,4.5,4,4,4.5,4.5,"Dusky chestnut, highly carbonated, forming a huge, peaking light tan head with sea foam consistency atop small to medium-sized bubbles. Retention and lacing are excellent, but it is difficult to pour without billowing out of the glass. Gobs of head stick to the edge of the glass, and head always remains at least 1/2" thick. Aroma is spicy and phenolic with notes of cloves, alcohol, hay, wheat malt, yeast and perhaps hints of ginger. No mustiness or sourness appreciated. Mouthfeel is bubbly, but very smooth and light in body despite it's high ABV of 8.5%. Taste begins with spicy phenols, leads into earthy amber malts with the slightest hop bitterness. A peppery wave of alcohol is noticeable but not intrusive. There is a brief slightly oxidized, rubbery note, likely due to the green bottle, but it thankfully quickly dissipates. The lightly dry, oaky finish leaves a saccharin sweetness on the back of the tongue. The alcohol is concealed for the most part...drinkability is good despite it's strength. A 750ml bottle gives me a pleasant buzz. While not imparted with Belgian Funk©®, it is a satisfying, drinkable brew.","Mitchster","Mar 23, 2003"
4.5,13.1,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"This beer is more brown than black, but it seems as if very few rays of light get through it. The creamy beige head that sits on top is substantial and long lasting. Aroma is sweet, fruity, musty and herbal. My first impression upon drinking is the solid earthy foundation of this brew. A leathery and musty presence. Then I am bombarded by an herbalness that is wrapped in spicy hop tones. And I discover the sweet malt that is blanketed with candy coated goodness. I love the taste of this beer. Mouthfeel has a nicely carbonated effervescence about it. Body is about medium. And the drinkability is substantial given that this brew is 8.5 a/v and I can't uncover any signs of ethanol.","Bighuge","Mar 04, 2003"
4.35,9.3,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Deep dark murky brown color, small, but simmering, tan head. Aroma: mollasses, nuts, butter, cream, dates, raisins, dark rum, all the rich flavors one can imagine. Thick, full, hot mouthfeel, full body, tingly hops. Super-charged with hops, the flavor keeps on coming, simmers and stews, with a long lasting, rich, satisfying finish! Takes the cake for all brown ales everywhere, past, present, future. Round, delicious, sensuous, and utterly lip smackin'!","feloniousmonk","Jan 15, 2003"
4.25,6.8,4,4,4.5,4.5,4,"Flows burnt and murky under a fine gluey head. Trippy nose of mushrooms, bagged grass and woodpiles with some light gingerbread notes. A draught is earthy, a mouthful of tasty dead leaves, bittersweet turns hop and lingers under a muted shadow of savory spices and alcohol. All this funky flavor hitches a ride on an effervescent rocketship destined for galaxy gut. Unique and tasty, but truly odd, I'm still trying to figure out whether I like it as much as I think.","inebrius","Jan 13, 2003"

3.8,-4.5,4,4,3.5,4,4,"I liked the way it poured with a dark brown apperance and a nice foamy head. The aroma was of a spicy nature with a complex smell of malts. Although the taste was of malts and spices, the carbination is what turned me off. If not for the carbination, I would have really enjoyed this beer.","BeerManDan","Nov 26, 2002"
4.36,9.5,5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"The fact that this is so young will require me to go grab a few to age.  This is a very nice one...likely great with a little time.","cokes","Nov 10, 2002"
4.13,3.8,4.5,4,4,4,4.5,"This beer poured a dark amber color and formed an off white bubbly head that left some circular lace.  Some carbonation present.  An aroma of malt and caramel.  A flavor of malt and caramel.  Some dry elements in the finish.  A good beer.","Wildman","Oct 28, 2002"

3.58,-10.1,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"pours with a mass of foam. strong alcohol in the smell. it goes down smooth, but there is a very noticeable taste of alcohol. you just know it is gonna kick you in the pants. it is definitely one to go with if strong ales are your style","ElGuapo","Sep 29, 2002"
4.25,6.8,4.5,4.5,4,4,4.5,"The fluffy, mountainous, thick light tan head sits atop a hazy deep garnet hued brew.  The aroma is dominated by an assertively spicy Saaz hop nose accompanied by an overshadowed floral Goldings note.  Unripe plum - like, tart fruity esters are secondary and quite refined.  Mellow roasted barley, caramel malt and trace diacetyl become perceptible as the brew warms and the hop oils dissipate.  The flavor profile is not unlike the aroma-- An initial snap of hop bitterness quickly yields to spicy hop flavor that's almost sharp.  Light chocolate flavors then emerge only to be offset by a combination of green apple acetaldehyde and light clove phenols.  A light and pleasant molasses sweetness persists as a constant undertone.  Residual sweetness is well controlled in this brew and never becomes cloying.  Moderate in body, with an agreeable, but somewhat drying mouthfeel.  Flavors of grain reemerge in the dry finish, which is comprised of notes of biscuit malt and a touch of roasted barley sharpness.  Satisfying alcohol warmth stately creeps in after a significant deliberation.  Mc Chouffe is absolutely a unique and delicious brew, being reminescent of a Wee Heavy and Dubbel hybrid.   The drinkability is superb and belies the relatively high strength. . Further cellaring may tame the esters, but it's delicious in its current state.  "Best before end 2005"","marc77","Sep 02, 2002"
3.63,-8.8,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Good beer, malty, spicy, and perhaps a bit sugary (which i didn't particularly like), chocolate and candy sugar flavour, i liked it, but it could have been better, apparently its better when you put it in the cellar for a couple of years, maybe i'll give that a go.","rastaman","May 12, 2002"
4.7,18.1,4,4,5,5,5,"This is a great Belgian interpetation of the style. Beautiful reddish brown. Woody hop charater with rasinious/dried fruit flavor. Malty sweet having a great character that will improve with age.","mattmaples","Sep 22, 2001"
