"Not quite as sweet as some, but fully complex with unique flavors."

"On tap at Hoffer’s cigar bar La Mesa. Rosemary and fruitcake. Dark ruby color. Would do this again."
""
""
""
""
"Had from bottle, little low on carbonation, little head, but still a nice, fruity, smooth taste.  Smell was a mixture of berries and citrus."
""
""
"Dried fruit, primarily raisins, plums, spice – rosemary to pine,  a trace of honey on the nose and a faint suspicion of tobacco fill the nose. Pours a bright ruby tinted chestnut under a ferocious 3” tan tinted cap that slowly descends to ¼” but leaves gothic cathedral window lace. It crosses the tongue with a very creamy, fruity, alcoholic attack with a firm base of honey in the background. It is spiced with a hint of pine, big dark raisins, plums and hints of fig and dates. There is a light herbal astringency in the finish but overall the rosemary is very subtle and asserts itself more in the aftertaste. The beer is very finely bubbled  with a medium full body. The alcohol is warming but not hot."
""
""
""
"Pour is dark, almost opaque with a thick head that gives way to a creamy lacing. You can tell from the smell that this is a Belgian dark ale, with a strong strawberry smell, rich caramel and a hint of alcohol. Rosemary is also present in the nose, with a hint of pine. Light carbonation with a very complex flavour - the raisins give the drink a very wine-like taste, but with alcohol spiciness, caramel sweetness and a powerful rosemary taste that I found a bit too overwhelming. Medium-dry finish. A very complex beer, that's interesting right from the start, but becomes a bit too overwhelming as you go."

"Dark brown, raisin and slight herb on nose, very sweet palate."

"Final score: 3.95"

"Many dark elements to the flavor like fudge and bitter chocolate. I'm still tasting mint, mostly in the aftertaste. Neutral body and effervescence."
""

""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This beer doesn't quite give the melodramatic first impression other strong dark ales present, but it still maintains excellent flavor and mouthfeel, while also pulling some nicely unique punches. I would not hesitate to purchase and savor this beer again."
"Overall:  It's been sometime, been still delicious."

"12% ABV on tap @10thstreetlive is true to it's description of darkened raisins, carmel sweetness of dark malts, chocolate and hints of rosemary. You might feel like a sinner for sure after a glass. Cheers & Enjoy!"

"Overall - a good beer up front. Lots of character and depth initially but does hold as it warms."
""
""
""
""
"O: Not a huge fan of this. Full of flavor but off-balance with the amount of alcohol and sweetness. Perhaps fresher would help and I bought this at retail (albeit a trusted retailer) so I can't account for its entire storage history"
""
""
""
""
""
"O- A damn nice beer. I am glad I gave it some time as I couldn't taste any alcohol at 10%. Depending on your pallet it may be too sweet, but I like the style along with hop bombs."
""
""
""
""
""
"The alcohol is almost drying on the tongue giving the beer a drier finish than most beers this dark. Its kinda weird but after a few sips the alcohol notes kinda dissipate and the malts come forward a little more as well as that Belgian yeast kinda flavor. I could even pick up some notes of chocolate/ coffee but its very faint. I think I would enjoy a little more intense coffee/ chocolate flavor from this beer ( a little but not a lot). There is suppose to be rosemary but I could not pick that up."
""
""
""
""
""

""

""

""
""
"Overall – A good beer but a little too herbal and sweet for me. Another fine beer from this brewer though, I just would buy something different next time."
""
"O - Not a winter warmer, but this is what I wish all winter warmers tasted like. Complex, warm, smooth, and delicious."
""
""
""
"Overall, not the best Belgian strong I've had. That being said it is not at all bad."
""
""
"D: This beer deserves more credit. It is fairly big and sweet with nice malt complexity however balanced by a light bitterness, lush mouth feel, and some interesting favors. I didn’t find this to be over spiced at all. Very delectable in fact. Will seek this one out again."
""
""
""
"O: Definitely worth a try. I'd love to try the barrel aged version."
"750 ml bottle into tulip glass, 2013 vintage. Pours hazy nearly opaque dark brown color with a 2 finger fairly dense khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Spotty foamy lacing clings on the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of big raisin, prune, fig, apple, pear, caramel, toffee, molasses, toast, biscuit, honey, coriander, clove, pepper, herbal, dark bread, light roast, light banana, and yeast earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of malt, yeast, and spice notes; with big strength. Taste of big raisin, prune, fig, pear, apple, caramel, molasses, toast, biscuit, honey, dark bread, light roast, coriander, clove, pepper, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Lingering notes of raisin, prune, fig, pear, apple, caramel, molasses, toast, dark bread, light roast, clove, pepper, herbal, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a while. Damn nice balance and complexity of dark malt, yeast ester, and spice flavors; with a great malt/yeast flavor balance and zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Medium carbonation and fairly full bodied; with a moderately slick and slightly syrupy mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a small warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent Belgian strong dark ale. All around great balance and complexity of dark malt, spice, and yeast ester flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the big ABV. A very enjoyable offering."
""
""
"O - A very interesting take on a well-established style. I am glad I picked up this bottle and aged it for more than a year. Certainly worth a pour or two when the occasion is right. 4.5/5"

"The base of 10 Commandments is a good Belgian Strong Dark Ale, but the twist here is there appears to be a potent spiciness to it, which to me tasted like ginger. Luckily, the base is strong enough to mitigate some of the spice and keep as an enjoyable beer to drink with a meal. Expect a profile of prunes, ginger, figs, and a kiss of liquor, with the addition of a dark bodied beer with good head retention, a fun smell, and a beer that's a little different flavor-wise per style."

"Poured deep mahogany with maple hues in the light. Off white cap that took a while to diminish. Brilliant glimmer when held up to the light. Figs, dates, raisins come to mind in the nose. Large bouquet of anise, spice, and cocoa, along with fainter crystal malts. The flavor is of blends of caramel, toffee, and malt, with a raisiny, black currant overtone. A bit of dark honey towards the finish. Not cloying at all, but very nicely balanced with the spiciness, sweetness, and fruit. The texture is smooth and adds to the complexity of the beer. Perfect carbonation. I will obtain this beer whenever I see it."
"There's little doubt that this is a world class Belgian-style ""Quad"" in the making. But the problem in that it isn't there yet. This 2-year vintage isn't enough. I wouldn't hesitate to cellar this beer for at least five years in order to let the beer dry out a bit more, for the alcohols to degrade and for the smooth vinous tones to grow."

"With a few years of age this will probably be a masterpiece. At the moment it's quite nice but a bit of a sweet, hot mess."

"The beer is good, but I wouldn't buy it again. The Brett isn't what is throwing me off, either. I just had a certain level of expectations going in as this is one of my favorite styles. Drinking this makes me want to review another beer now!"
""
""
"O-Winner winner chicken dinner. Have bought 3 bottles to try to age because I really want to see what a year of aging does to the booze in the after taste but don't see them getting anywhere near a year."
""

""

"Poured from a 22oz. bottle into a tulip glass. Pours very dark, I would say a very dark brown with no light penetration. Pours with a surprisingly intense head, but minimal carbonation thereafter. A small amount of lacing. Smells sweet, maybe dates and figs. Tastes wonderful. The honey is really well balanced. A sour note with figs and dates hits you a few seconds later, but sweet up front. Very smooth. The sweetness really covers the 10% ABV. All the flavors come together really well with this. I will definitely be buying more in the future and would love to see what aging does to this."

"overall? maybe I was looking for something lighter this evening. I knew what it was before I opened it. I suppose it has its place and maybe it wasn't with me tonight. it was okay but did not overwhelm me. if i'm sipping it, it's okay, but there is the alcohol bite that keeps coming up in the flavor."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The flavor is just as vibrant as the aroma with dark fruits and spices but a linger post-bitterness that almost feels a tad boozy but a bit less pungent. I can see why the Bros call this outstanding."
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Like a Christmas ale in its spice component. Kinda overpowers the beer."
"O - A pleasant BSDA, with a nice twist from the Rosemary. Nice take on the style, the high alcohol isn't annoying but you could definitely age this one for a year or more I'd imagine."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"OV: Good sweet flavours, though you can taste the booziness of this one. I think some cellaring would benefit this beer. Didn't get any spices on this which I think it needs to balance the sweetness. A solid brew, but not World class."

"25.9 oz bottle, corked and wired. Poured passively towards the belly of a Duvel tulip, leaving a couple foamy fingers of toffee-colored head. Looks a formidable mahogany though when held to light there is some deep ruby transparency. The nose first hits me as very cherry-tart, almost like Fun Dip, including a hit of vanilla much like those candied dip sticks included. Yeah, I think I need some Fun Dip too. Ahem. Anyhow, the gamut of taste runs in three stages: the first is instantly dried, sticky-sweet old fruit like figs, raisins of course, dried cranberries and cherries, followed swiftly by dry char and weathered oak, straight into boozy heat. The 10% abv here is present though with some age I imagine that would be tempered - though the heat doesn't particularly hamper my drinking experience here. Mouthfeel is intermediate in viscosity, cloudy and yeasty in texture as this is a dark Belgian farmhouse stylee conditioned with Brett. Overall, I will absolutely drink this again and will double up for next year's batch as I'd like to explore 10 Commandments cellaring potential. I recommend this brew."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- overall this is a solid belgian strong dark, curious to know how this one would age, solid beer, I'd buy again if I was in the mood for this style"
""
""
""
""
"The 10 Commandments was good, not great. It delivered a great feel and smell, with a bit of an overdose of sugar on the palate though. I recently had the opportunity to try several beers from Lost Abbey and am impressed. I recommend trying this beer, but overall give it only a 4 out of 5."

"Great beer, but hard to get thru the big bottle. Very bitter and herbal. Beer for grown ups, but off-balance a bit. I liked it, but not a favorite."
""
""
""
"O - Not bad, not bad at all. Held up surprisingly well for a four year old brew, but some of the components have obviously died down at his point. The individual flavors have melded quite well. I don't know where the funk/sour in the nose comes from, but it's certainly nowhere in the taste. Overall, glad I got to see what it turned into after four years."

"Overall: a good, if unusual, beer. I find that the more I drink, the more the herbal bitterness builds ... but that's not stopping me."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, strong kick, good representation of style, this is a nice darker Belgian-style beer to sip on for a long time."
"Pours a solid dark brown with faint ruby brown highlights when held to light and a huge fluffy beige head that persists forever. Smells of pepper and spice with a solid dark sugary background. The flavor is sweet with sugary malt, a bit of dark fruit, lots of pungent and bitter spice, some pepper and other yeasty phenols. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation and a sweet almost bitter mouthfeel. I've been sitting on this one for a while, I remember liking it a bit more when it was fresh. As is I am neither excited nor disappointed with it."

"a true beast, or should i say devine being? on tap at vine street, this beer pours a dense mocha color with a thin white veil. it smells like oak, bourbon, caramel, cocoa powder, brown sugar, and belgian yeast. its got an equally elaborate flavor, with some of the sweeter tones coming up first, and the alcohol basically eliminating anthing that might be subtle about the late middle or back end of the flavor eixperience. there is some vanilla and honey and oaky booze that stays in the mouth over the more than full body. the alcohol is relately punishing here, but the small pour helped me get over that. this is one ive been wanting to try for a long time, and while its not the most unique and reaching beer ive had from the lost abbey, it definitely is a well crafted brew, more in the barleywine tradition than he belgian i think. all up and great beer, not sure how i would have consumed the 750ml version... actually i know exactly how..."

""

"When poured into a tulip glass, the color was of an medium dark amber brown, with a lot of light tan foam and a fair amount of lace. The smell of roasted malts and spices was evident in the aroma. The taste of roasted malts and spices was also evident, along with a sweet candy finish. Not a lot of alcohol kick back in the finish."
""

""

""
""
"O - A tasty BSDA, but a bit strong on the herbs to be exceptional. Glad I tried it, but wouldn't go out of my way to have it again."
"O/D - For this style, this beer takes all the malt attributes and pushes it to the edge. Comes off a little cloying at times, but that is okay as I sip it. ABV is awfully strong of course but it maintains the symmetry."
""
"Pours a clear, but very dark brown with minimal tan head that falls and leaves no lacing. Nose is a bit milder like roasted apples. Flavor is a bit more pungent than I would have figured. Vibrant sweet tone with an almost smoked edge to it. Very slight at that though. Tangy edge abounds. Feel is smooth on liquid and carbonation. A nice BSDA that is a bit too vibrant, but still nice to drink."
""
"The overalls complexity and flavor of this beer are great. The rummy and dark fruit favors really make this an excellent quad. The rosemary comes in a little strong for me, and I could see it being even better if not for that. Overall another hit from the abbey."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a clear dark brown with a foamy dark khaki head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, brown sugar, yeast, lots of interesting spices, and alcohol. Taste is much the same and the spices are the dominant flavor here and linger long after each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer but the spices take center stage in the aroma and flavor."
""
""
"O: Its good, probably a better beer than I scored it, but it didn't really do it for me. The flavor profile was pretty intense still, and I think St. Bernardus 12 is a better offering."
""
"This is a nice brew. It has a lot of good well balanced flavor."
"O: disappointing. a unique brew. ton of honey, raisins and enormous spices which are balance nicely amongst themselves. But, the alcohol makes a rude entrance throwing this one off. If you like DBSAs, this one is worth a shot because of its uniqueness and it should be cellared for a year due to its “hotness” IMO."
"(originally reviewed: 07-31-2011)"
""
"Overall: A really nice example of the style and I'm happy it held up so well, so long. Loads of raisin and honey with alot, maybe too much, sweetness. I really enjoyed this."
"Anyway, I was going to drain pour it, but instead mixed the second half with a Maudite from Unibroue, and then went out into our spa and got drunk. Kickass blend."
"I have been reluctant to try another beer from this brewer, as the last one I tried had a cork sealing problem and was flat, rendering if nearly undrinkable. I am happy to report that this bottle was just fine, the cork had a nice seal, and the beer seems fully carbonated. It is a nice beer, not quite my favorite for this style, but very nice, and I am glad I gave it a try."
""
""
""
"This is a really nice offering from Lost Abbey. This Belgian Strong has a very nice, deep malt character. The raisins add a nice touch of character without being to over powering. I was a bit disappointed by the appearance as I found it to be a bit ""muddy"". None the less the flavor profile more than makes up for this!"
""
""
"Courtesy of Dave Guay. 750ml corked and caged bottle. Pours a dull mahogany hue with a loose head that dissipates towards the edges into a thin band. Nose expresses currants, figs, honey and a hint of spice. Taste follows nose with the addition of an earthy/grassy presence on a malty backbone. Prunes and rosemary also asserts in the flavor profile. Mouthfeel is medium-light in body with a lively carbonation. Overall, a decent BSDA but way too much happening in the Roasemary department for my sensibilities."
""
"O: I liked this spin on a BSDA. The additions of honey, raisins, and rosemary make this a unique ale that I'm sure I will pick up from time to time."
""
"Violet with some redder hues in the light, big tan head that leaves gratuitous amounts of lacing and good retention. Interesting nose for a quad, dark fruits and mostly raisins appear first but some of the sweeter notes (the honey that was used?) support this immensely. Some fresh, mild herbal notes as well come through along with some spicing. This resembles rosemary more apparently as it warms. Quite unique. Dark fruits and raisins again on the palate, rich caramel notes, sugar and perhaps some candied sugar. All sugary dark fruits, all the way. Full, rich and sweet feel. No detectable alcohol, and dangerous in this regard. A tasty and interesting twist on a quad."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"It reminds me of the first beer I tried to make, but much better of course. Another winner from the Lost Abbey."
"B-"
""
""
""
"Cheers!"
"I think this is a pretty decent beer that borders on a wine."
""
"O- I did not enjoy this very much, I'm thinking maybe ingot a strange over carbonated bottle, but I don't know, the aroma was rather soapy and unpleasant as well, at least to me"
""
""
"O – A very nice dark fruit belgian. Spicey but a bit boozey. Great warmness and finish"
""
""
""
"O - Liked the nose, liked the taste, hated the mouthfeel. Dunno if it's just this bottle, perhaps I'll seek this out on tap to confirm."
""
""
"O-Very complex, good blend of malt and phenolics. The alchoholic strength was very well incorporated.I loved the alchohol notes in the nose and palate, as well as the subtle rosemary notes. However the astringency was quite high and makes an otherwise great beer hard to drink for me."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A tasty beer. Drinkability is moderate. Fairly complex."
"All in all, a good beer, and one I might have enjoyed a little more fresh. Flavorful, but likely at one point more flavorful."
"Pours a murky brown with a 2 finger off color white head, and plenty of sticky lace all about the place (cant tell if there is sediment floating or pieces of the cork that broke off). Smells of dark fruits soaked in alcohol, plums, figs, raisins etc. Nice breadiness from the malts, and a slight alcohol prefume. Huge sweetness on the tongue, grapes and figs all over. The sweet malts leave traces of chocolate covered raisins, and maraschino cherries that give a bitter/tart finish. Also i find as the beer warms up a bit a big Ny-Quil quality at the end, weird. Full bodied, medium-high initial carbonation that prepare your tongue for the bold sweetness. This beer is very well done, great complexity and composition, afraid its just way to sweet for my liking."
"Well, I was right, I've had this before and it is a BSDA with some plum/raisins, just forgot about this beer. This has aged pretty well and definitely tasting great right now. Thanks!"
""
""
"It's murky dark reddish with a really beautiful creamy head that converged to the center to a cool looking nucleus of foam. Rad. Random soapy lacing. The nose is so boozy to me, but I can definitely pick up the rosemary too. I think they must have used a lot of raisins in this one because its juicy with dark fruit with a caramal/chocolate background, then pops into a dry yeasty finish. I didn't think my palate was that refined as of yet to pick up different levels of complexity, and it surely isn't, but this was definitely a fun beer to drink."
"To be honest, this didn't come across well as a Belgian Strong Dark Ale. I didn't get too many dark fruit flavors and they were weak when I identified them. The black licorice was too prevalent for this licorice hater. I had high hopes, so maybe that's why I feel let down by this brew. Maybe I'm just putting to much stock into the Belgian Strong Dark Ale description, or maybe I need to just read the label before ordering a sample. I'd like to see them make this their own by giving it a distinct flavor that separates it from the pack."
""
"Medium bodied with average carbonation. The alcohol is well hidden. Unfortunately there is an aftertaste of rosemary. I like rosemary well enough, but don't care for it in beer. Lose the rosemary, and this beer would be much better."
""
""
""
""
""
"I love some of the Lost Abbey stuff, but this beer is just a big disappointment to me, it didn't really do anything well, other than maybe look nice. Don't judge a book by its cover. . . the cover might be substantially better than what is inside."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Very sweet and boozy, alcohol was not well hidden at all. Not a sessionable beer in the least, kinda hard to get this bottle down actually."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I don't know what it is but this beer just had a really weird nasty flavor to it that lingered after each sip. It was sort of a nasty Steel Reserve/Mickey's kind of boozy/chemically flavor, and it became more evident the more I drank. Don't think I'll ever buy this again, especially at the exorbitant price of $13.99 for a 750ml bottle"
"Final thought - 10% and $10. Give this one a try"

"Overall this was lucky to get a 3. I think if they had better quality control, this might be an ok beer. There is no way this phenolic mess was what it is supposed to taste like."
"o - overall, this is pretty tasty. not as intense as others are in the sytle, but this is a solid offering from an american brewery. i'm a big fan of the style and this was not a disappointment."
"another suprise that i haven't reviewed. An american accented strong dark in that it's malt character is close to a american double. Toasty, mild chocolate, coffee. Nose of molassess, and belgian sugar cane that made the low gravity a reality. Mild fruit. Rather savory. Rather warm going down but not boozy. Great with meat well peppered. Mild spice but sustaining."
"O: Tastes good but the mouthfeel is a bit off"
"Not a bad one overall, i haven't had too many Lost Abbeys since I cannot get them here in Maine but this is one of the better ones I have had so far."
"O: A very good BSDA that was very pleasant to drink. One of the better interpretations of the style that I have tried made this side of the pond."
"Overall, this isn't a great representation of the style. Pretty middle of the road, but definitely has some redeeming qualities. Above average."
"Full body, a bit higher carbonation, sticky, lingering, and a touch dry on the tongue. Pretty decent, but it felt like something was just a bit off on this one."
"Bottle shared at the September iteration of the Santa Cruz tasting series. Pours dark brown with a fluffy tan head. Aromas of rosemary-glazed meat, soy sauce, and boozy chocolate. Flavor is similar with roasted malt, smoke, herbs, raisins. The brett isn’t all that apparent in the taste. It does leave the mouthfeel a little light and dry."
"Strong aroma is malty and earthy with a firm overtone of rosemary and fruity hints. It pours an opaque dark-chocolate brown with a thick, frothy tan head. Be careful - this can fizz like all-get-out! Flavor is quite distinctive, earthy and fruity, equal parts grape and apple, with a firm but not overpowering rosemary note and hints of caramel and nuts. Full-bodied lively texture leaves an earthy, fizzy finish. Thou Shalt Drink Only Craft Brewed Beer!"
"This brew pours out as a nice looking brown color with a fluffy light brown head on it. The head is a little rocky looking and leaves some decent lacing. The smell of the beer is spicy and has some sweet dark fruit aromas going on in there too. The taste of the beer gives off some roasted malts, raisins, yeast, and some other spices I'm not sure of. The mouthfeel is pretty good, it had a pretty good amount of carbonation to it. Overall I found this brew to be a good sipping beer for colder nights. Enjoyable."
"Serving type: bottle"
"O: Drinkable, but very dense. A little heavy handed with the oak, but otherwise enjoyable and well rounded."
"10 Commandments is indeed a moral foundation of the American craft brewing industry; the direct word of a brewing god stating that beers should be distinctive and individualistic, but with a respect for tradition. Tomme Arthur uses the mash tun like Picasso used clay and the results, this example in particular, are generally masterpieces. Find religion here."
"Taste- Well I had wanted to try this for a while. A bit of a let down down due to the overuse of the honey and rosemary. Still a fan of Lost abbey and will come back to their beer."
"Vintage 2011. Pours a dark brownish-red (almost purple) color with a large caramel-colored head that takes quite some time to diminish. Scent is a nice mixture of chocolate, dark fruits, coffee, and light hints of the honey and rosemary. The taste of this beer is very unique...I'm not sure if this beer is brewed with a wild yeast...but it sure tastes like it. Pleasant wild yeast (Brett) flavors with some lovely chocolate and dark fruit aromas. Some booziness blends well with the rosemary and raisiny chocolate flavors. Mouthfeel is well carbonated and has the mouthfeel of a fresh bottle of chimay blue. Full bodied and crisp. Drinkability is high. Overall, this beer is awesome. I had this a long time ago when I wasn't really into craft, and I remember not caring for it very much. Now I want to go buy more and cellar some!"
"overall 10C is a good beer, perhaps even a very good one, but is not likely to be confused with a truly upper echelon BSDA."
" ~ This is acertainly not a sessionable beverage. This served with a dinner of pork or pasta I think would be a good match. This is definitely something I would recommend to my friends. My only drawback here is that I think I could have cellared it a bit longer. I feel one year didn't do it the justice it probably has coming in the third to fifth year of it's life. Next time I'll let it live a bit longer."
"Picked this one up while I was out in Cali for the Bruery Reserve Society Party. Big thanks to womencantsail for shipping this one to me after I left! Served from bottle into a Green Man snifter. Poured a massively dark brown with a one and a half finger light tan head that subsided to a minimal amount slowly. Maintained excellent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, dark fruit, raisins, rosemary, oregano, and a slight sour note. The flavor was of sweet malt, dark fruit, raisins, subtle honey, herbs, and a very subtle sour note. It had a medium feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Ovearll this was a pretty tasty brew. It was really smooth and easy drinking. I chose to drink this one to pre-game a non-drinking wedding if you must know... I would have never guessed this one to be 10% ABV at all. The sour note that I mentioned in this review really only showed up once the brew had almost reached room temperature, but was actually well blended with everything else in this brew."
"O: Cloying, boozy, and not very enjoyable. This one started out well, but I found it tough to get through."
"3.5 D: This is a good beer (I find that most carbonated LA beers are good beers), but drinking a 750 of this myself was a mistake. It's too sweet to drink without a friend. I'd prefer the yeast be a bit cleaner (maybe some more time to condition), but otherwise pretty good."
"Overall a tasty beer but not a completely solid experience."
"T- Pleasant but straightforward: rich dark malt, coffee, chocolate. No rosemary was detectable. Bitter finish."
"Tastes are dark syrups/candi syrups, dark fruits, dark fruit skins, booze, tartness, Belgian yeast, lint, mango pits, wallpaper, tissue paper, ink, graham crackers, Valerian root, pork, hay, fried chicken wings, flaked rye, rolled oats, oatmeal, caramel sugar and spice. Not bad."
"A well made, complex, BSDA with a lot of interesting things going on, but I think the thick mouthfeel gets in the way a little bit of the more nuanced flavors."
"lots of perfumey, herbal flavors -- coming from such a dark, rich malty brew -- it is an original. i like it!"
"This brew pours a murky ruby brown hue with decent carbonation that leaves behind a creamy two finger head and a nice rim of lacing,the smell is herbal spicy hops,raisins,dark candied fruits,red wine and bready malts,it has a nice full bodied averagely carbonated mouthfeel and really suits the style with tastes of xmas pudding,brown sugar,maple syrup,bready malts and is finished off with a dried dark fruity bitterness,overall very true to the style and this is one beer with alot of flavours going on if you like your BSDA's you have to try this one."
"Poured a hazy dark brown with a thick finger of whitish head. Bready aroma with hints of sugar and dried fruits. A taste of pancakes and maple syrup up front fading to a plain breadiness; dried fruits, raisins, and a hint of chocolate and light spice. Not quite full-bodied, and nicely drinkable."
"O: Can only drink 1 per sitting, but this beer is enjoyable. I think if this was the 2008 or 2009 brew, the alcohol would have been too much and not enjoyable."
"jd"
"A very enjoyable beer. Wish the rosemary would have showed up more, but maybe it's the age. A nicely done beer that is pretty darn unique. I would have this one again."
"D-This is super boozy but super delicious. The fruit is strong is well integrated with the taste, but this is so strong it's definitely a sipper."
"I would buy this again....but there are several BSDAs that I would buy before this one."
"O: A very nice beer and quite interesting."
"O-This confirms my belief that Lost Abbey beers are simply not condusive to cellaring. However, it's really interesting. I have to give it points for originality, and making me think. Well done Tomme!"
"I really like what Lost Abbey is getting at with this one. It's a rich brew - I spread my 750mL bottle out over two days. Review is primarily based on the first tasting, but with proper resealing it held up just fine for the second evening. Spread it out or better yet, enjoy this one with a good friend. Great winter ale - if I lived somewhere it actually gets cold and had a fireplace, I would love to sit down with a great friend next to the fire for some great conversation. That said it is about 52 degrees here in LA tonight, which my wife says is ""freeezing"". This seems like a good one to warm things up."
"D - Drinkability is moderately high. Definitely an interesting beer and not something I expected from the bottle. The spices bring a fresh taste, although the honey is a bit subdued. A great beer though in the way it hides its alcohol and ease of drinking!"
"O: Pretty good beer overall. The alcohol is masked nicely and the intricate taste keeps you coming back for more."
"M/D: Highly carbonated and light bodied. Could have benefited from being a little thicker, maybe. And overall the beer was just too sweet for my liking."
"The mouthfeel is super super full and thick with less than average carbonation, but the overly full, borderline cloying and sticky raisin body of this brew lowers the drinkability for me. Finishing the full 750 may prove to be a challenge. Overall I wish this was served in a smaller bottle because a 750 of this will bore you and/or put you straight to bed."
"D- Pretty potent brew with high abv%. A drink that is so good I could get in trouble."
"D: Very odd brew, but not to bad, wont be having another."
"Drinkabilty - Split bottle with 5 people, no one wanted to finish there glass. Im not a wine fan and this really tasted like a table wine. Not for me."
"Poured into a snifter, appearance is a dark black with a little amber coming from the edges of the glass when held up to the light. Two fingers of tan head with gorgeous sparkling lacing. The aroma is very Belgian strong. I get a sweet and spicy sniff from the glass that definitely explains the raisins it's brewed with. Taste is just like the smell with strong notes of burnt sugars and dark fruit...definitely taste some of the alcohol in this one but it is masked well and comfortably warming...a great beer to be drank during a break from the cold of winter. Mouthful is discrete and finishes clean. As far as drinkability goes, to me I would best enjoy this in one or two 10 oz. pours per session. A great night cap beer or after dinner desert. Taking your sweet time on this one is worth it as many of the complexities of the sweetness and spice comes through as it warms. A great stab at a Socal-brewed Belgian Quad!"
"My first offering from The Lost Abbey. I had high expectations and they were met. Great tasting beer here and can't wait to try their other concoctions."
"drinkability: Too rich to be quaffed. Mellow and relatively gentle."
"D- Its a defenite sipper and there are some harsh qualities and sour notes that don't seem right in the blend. Its good but I won't get this one again."
"Drink-ability is eh....Again, almost cloying sweetness, with booze. Like dumping brandy into some grape drank."
"This pours a deep brown almost black color with a nice creme colored head that lines the glass. The smell is extremely sweet. Raisins, plums, molasses, and breads make up the smell. Some sugar is also noted on the nose. Taste is really good. Nice sweet finish with raisins, plums, and herbs all on the quaff. Definitely a sipper but really good tasting. Mouthfeel is medium bodied. Drinkability is good. I would like to see how this beer develops."
"From the first sip, I was hooked. At the last sip, I wanted more. As I sit here, typing this, I wish I was drinking this beer right now."
"d - easy before, during, and after dinner"
"In summary, it's an extremely close tussle between the Pelican Grand Cru and the Lost Abbey 10 commandments; Unibroue's La terrible is clearly behind slightly. I would probably still award first place to the Pelican Grand Cru due to the slighty more complex flavors and better mouthfeel but the 10 commandments is following extremely close in second place. Final ranking: 1st - 2009 Pelican Grand Cru, 2nd - 2008 Lost Abbey 10 Commandments, 3rd - 2004 Unibroue La Terrible"
"wow, taste is right there too. honey, rosemary, raisins, dates, caramel with a salty sweet finish. if only the oceans were made of this! The saltiness at the end is a bit distracting, but I beg for more. It's just alluring. A buxom Moses coming down off the mountain with his salty carved rocks. A really unique flavor, and my favorite taste of an American BSDA. I feel like it really cuts into what would otherwise be a very sweet beer. Tomme, this is excellent, thank you."
"Pretty good, but nothing earth shattering or mind changing. This can be pricey at times, so I don't know if I'd choose this over cheaper alternatives...including many imports."
"A well balanced BSDA, however not very complex. Perhaps a touch more from the yeast and less abv burn."
"Poured on-tap at the Port/Lost Abbey Brewery. The beer is a very dark amber/brown color with no head. There is a smell of malt, caramel, and spice. The beer has a sweet and sour forward flavor, with plum and spicy undertones. Very balanced, and extremely unique. The sweet and sour balance is also present on the aftertaste. The beer is bold and robust in mouth, with a nice, smooth finish. Very unique and wonderful flavors (can't say that enough), and a very decent beer to drink."
"D: One of the better LAs I've had, On par with Carnevale."
"D--Not bad, a little bit sweet and cloying to drink a bunch of, but very good for the style. I would probably want to see out his beers more often if owner was not such a poon..."
"Poured dark brown with brown highlights that had a finger worth of khaki head and left nice frothy lacing sticking to the glass. I could detect honey, rosemary, dark fruits, sweet malts, booze, and faint chocolate notes; very intresting nose. The rosemary was more apparent on the palate with some smokey character alongside dark fruit, honey, chocolate malt accents. The booze was noticeable but not overhelming. The brew was medium in body with a good amount of carbonation especially from lost abbey which had a sweet, earthy, slight boozy, but smokey, silky finish. It drank really good considering how hot it was and is probably one of my favorite year round brews from lost abbey."
"Overall a very unusual beer. Herbal spice quality doesn't quite match with the dark fruit sweetness. The flavor is a bit odd, and takes some getting used to. I don't know if I could drink a lot of this."
"Over all this one didn't really do it for me, a bit harsh and seemed a bit off."
"Says it was brewed with rosemary but I couldn't taste or smell it. Truthfully I'm not sure I'd recognize it if I did."
"D: Extremely pleasant with plenty to think about."
"I am not a fan of this beer. Outside of the rosemary funk, this is a good beer. Too bad it dominates the taste..."
"Overall an excellent Belgian strong dark ale. Not as good as I remember from having it on tap but still delicious."
"Beer is medium bodied and pretty effervesant in the mouth. Its spicy and mildly sweet, its not very great. Its standard for most holiday ales, yes you CAN brew with spices, but have you considered NOT using spice? Whatever. Not a repeat for me, at best its average."
"Hazy brown beer with decent head and lacing. Alcohol detectable in the aroma and in the taste. This beer is too heavily spiced for me. An over-abundance of strong rosemary, cinnamon and nutmeg flavors dominate much of the flavor profile. While spices can enhance a beer's intrigue and flavor, I believe that less is more, and that the beauty is in the subtlety. Good carbonation level. I was hoping this would be a better beer."
"D- interesting and tasty, if not a bit odd. Could use a bit less heat but I think paired with some rich foods and fatty meats this would be wonderful."
"Dark fruits of figs and prunes are scented with spicy German hops and just a hint in the finish of resinous rosemary and floral honey. Aroma is sweet and alcoholic, one of Lost Abbey's many great dessert beers. Body is syrupy and delicious. Carbonation is light, but not so much that it doesn't give your palette a decent scrubbing between sips. Raisins contribute to dark caramel flavors, while rosemary contributes an almost-unnoticed whiff of resin. The rosemary and raisins would have made good secret ingredients."
"d - A decent dark ale with some nice dark fruit and spice. Would try again."
"Big Props to Gary for thinking of me!!!"
"Overall I found this to be an interesting beer however it was a bit sweeter than I was anticipating. If some of the sweetness were turned down a notch I would be a bigger fan, but even as it is it's worth a shot."
"Definitely a unique take on the style...has a sour-ish wood character with some dark fruit and rosemary leading the way as opposed to some of the more traditional sweet bready yeast flavors. They are present, but are relegated to the backseat. ABV is very well hidden and the mouthfeel is right about medium, but the beer is still rich and velvety. Some sour cherries, vanilla, oak and maybe even some cinnamon comes out as it warms. Plenty of complexity here. The raisins are noticeable as well and lend a unique flavor, I have a homebrewed Dubbel with raisins and it has the same almost licorice spiciness, though that is a poor descriptor. Has plenty of complexity, that is for sure. This is a very, very good beer, I would buy this again in a heartbeat were I to see it again."
"A great beer to try, though I can't help that with a little more heft to the body it would be greatly improved."
"Notes: Goes great with the homemade pretzel I just baked and should be a top tier complement to any food."
"Relatively mild aroma of honey, raisins, and dark fruit. Ample carbonation and a slightly syrupy mouthfeel. Intense flavor off the bat with lots of honey and caramel followed by more raisins, spice, and just a hint of rosemary. Lingering finish with plenty of warm alcohol. Very tasty and easy to drink, it reminded me a bit of Lost Abbey's Angel's Share, but without the heaviness from the bourbon barrel aging."
"D - Like I said, the nose was promising but I was let down with the flavors...it had to be the rosemary because a beer with honey and raisins should be delicious"
"2009 vintage. 'Twas a very good year. I guess. The beer pours a darkly translucent dark brown topped by a finger of bright ecru foam. The nose comprises figs, raisins, brown sugar, prunes, red apples, rye bread, and a tiny bit o' chocolate...you know, for the kids... The taste emphasizes the raisins, figs, rye bread, and brown sugar, adding in some honey, pepper, and some burnt sugar. The body is a solid medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a very smooth feel. Overall, a solid BSDA, but I don't think it's all that special."
"D- I like this one quite a bit. I think its so far one of the best I've had from this brewery. I would drink this again with out a thought."
"D: I really like the smooth honey taste and sweetness. A pretty unique beer. Yet another winner from Lost Abbey."
"D - This is the definition of complexity, but in a good way. This is a sipping beer that keeps rewarding in different ways as you go."
"Comments: A good beer, but I think I have yet to truly tap into the genius of the Lost Abbey roster."
"D-I felt the booziness was a little too much. Although clocking in at 10%, I felt the alcohol could have been better masked. The flavors are all over the place-this is great; some melding seems in order. Maybe this one just needs to sit for a little while."
"D - Drinkability is fairly nice for the ABV, and the flavors of the beer are nice, but I just don't see myself having to many glasses of this beer or purchasing it again."
"D: The beer is very good to sip and the flavors are interesting enough to enjoy this beer on its own, without a food pairing."
"This is a sipper. I think I could have a couple of these over a few hours. It's wonderful how the warmth/cold changes the flavor drastically. You always expect some small changes, but this one has a flavor spectrum related to the temperature that is pretty amazing."
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation. It's a little creamy but the carbonation is also sharp on the palate. Drinkability is pretty good, it has some nice flavors to it and I enjoyed drinking it."
"D: A sipper for sure. Given that, it's quite drinkable. Share it with friends after a meal to aid the conversation. A quality brew from a quality brewer."
"Poured completely flat from the bottle, a nice mahogany color with no head whatsoever. Chocolate, plums, figs, raisins and rosemary work together to offer a very pleasant nose. The flavors here are a bit disjointed, with the aforementioned dark fruits, alcohol, rosemary and brown sugar clearly evident. Unfortunately the lack of carbonation turns this into an overly sweet and cloying mess. Would like to try it again with some bubbles."
"Pours jet black in color with a caramel colored head. This is a very malty beer with undertones of fruit and coffee. Aroma is very much malty with coffee and chocolate scents. The mouthfeel is really nice.. smooth and surprisingly creamy. Goes down rather smooth. This is a mild beer with a lot of great flavor. The taste and smell f alcohol isnt all that present which is nice. Drinkability.. about 2 or 3 sipping beers."
"Drinkability:I love the complexity of this beer. The mixture of the fruit, dark chocolate, and spicing is amazing. The alcohol is super well hidden. If not for that I could drink this all day. Another winner from Lost Abbey."
"The intensity and changeable flavors here will slow you down. I can't imagine it being any more than a sipper for anyone. Still, very good experimental beer here from Tomme and Co."
"D: Very good. We basically finished the bottle before dinner was finished."
"we opened a beautiful 2008 bottle to celebrate our good friend headed out to the wild of east oregon for the forseeable future. a celebratory beer to celebrate the great dinner of halibut, rice, and assorted greens, soaked in butter or bacon grease. a dessert. the raisins hit right off, the massive carbonation pushing the aroma. the rosemary is strong off the nose, making a strange olfactory delight, but subtle on the palate, complementary, soothing. it tells me everything will be alright, of course he'll be fine out there, but the sinful raisins tell me otherwise. i look into the fire, away from the stern thick brown liquid, and see the happiness of memories, past and future. it fills me with joy, i sip again."
"Drinkablity: This one is a sipper. It's too complex and too strong for me to go through more then a single bottle in a day."
"Finally, I wouldn't say the beer has the quality to entice the palate, therefore to me a drinks just above average. Overall not a bad honey ale."
"D: ask me tomorrow.... this is a sipper and the high level of sweetness makes you go slow. Still, this is a very well crafted beer that I'm happy to have found."
"A very good beer. I really liked the amount of flavors going on in this. A wonderful after-dinner sipper for the evening."
"I'm not sure why I was impressed by this beer the first time around. It seems like a Belgian Stout if anything and a mediocre example at that. Needs to be bigger in flavor for its high ABV."
"Out of a bottle this beer was gorgeous looking, a cloudy, stained-wood color with a cocoa-colored cap of head that both retained and left good clumps of lacing. The aroma was also excellent, candy sugars, citrus hops, caramel malt, tart cherries and sour candies. The flavors were dark and bold but lacked finesse. I tasted bitterness first led by coffee, followed by raisins, toasted malt and a lot of citrus hops that made it rather acidic, then dark malt, grains and lots of alcohol. Sour and punchy with alcohol lingering on the finish. The mouthfeel was ok but a little oily leaving a slick on my tongue, the body medium/full and the carbonation also average. Not a favorite, but tasty."
"The feel fits this beer almost perfectly. The consistency doesn't get in the way and acts as a perfect compliment to the taste. Somewhat carbonated, the body is substantive but has a creaminess which helps this harsh, strong beer go down easy."
"There is minimal carbonation but that doesn't inhibit a full mouthfeel. The alcohol provides a warm fullness to the beer. It is moderately drinkable; I am particular to this style and herbal flavors but it could be off putting if you are not used to this type of beer. It does hit hard if not sipped slowly."
"This is a very good BSDA. I am really enjoying this. Something that I would recommend."
"D - Overall good. Would welcome other people to try this beer. Would have been great if carbonated as it would bring out more flavor and character, etc."
"Overall - A world class brew from Lost Abbey - reminded me of Rochefort 10... Highly recommended...."
"Oveall, the aroma is amazing and the taste is solid. This beer held up fine and glad I aged it. LA made a fine beer here. I am splitting this one, so a half pour is a good amount."
"D: after drinking a bottle I would like another a great beer"
"D- This is a very rich and complex. The taste is very powerful, for me its somewhat hard to have lots of this beer."
"Smooth, so smooth is the texture, but with a bit of a hopped bite in the finish; a little unexpectedly dry, but perfectly fine with me. Honestly, I was shocked at how fast 10 Commandments disappeared from my glass as I read at The Pig on a lazy, cold afternoon. Grabbing a second was a must. There are precious few opportunities in the Midwest to get wares from The Lost Abbey; this was one not to miss, and I am glad I pounced upon it. Splendid BSDA, one for which I will be on the lookout when it next appears in Champaign. Complex and distinct. I wish The Lost Abbey were just around the corner for this poor sinner."
"Awesome beer that I will certainly seek out again!"
"Notes: This was my first Lost Abbey beer, and I'm very pleased. I had heard mixed feelings about this brewery, but will be trying more of their beers. If you're searching for a great interpretetation of a Belgian Dark, then look no further! On a side note, this beer had the most sediment I've ever seen! I had to rinse out the bottle at least five times before it all came off! But this was fine with me because I love the bready, yeasty flavor and texture yeasty beers impart."
"There was a lot going on in this beer, but without going over the top, which made it a very enjoyable beer to drink. As the beer got closer to room temperature it only got better. The spices made it a must have beer for the winter time."
"Drinkability is OK. First sip or two were off-putting, but as I worked through it, my palate adjusted and I enjoyed it well enough. But would have preferred it more with less rosemary."
"I'm partial to something harsher."
"I could see myself getting hurt with this beer. Its very drinkable for being so high ABV."
"I can appreciate the artsiness of the concept but the final outcome is less than stellar for me"
"10 Commandments is an interesting beer. I like it. I almost like it a lot. The flavor itself is interesting and very good. However, it needs more body and the carbonation needs to be a little higher. It just seems a little 'off,' if you will. It's far from a bad beer and is certainly worth picking up. A couple of small tweaks would really do the trick. It's still pretty good stuff, if you ask me."
"D - excellent beer. This is a very good interpretation of the Belgian Strong Ale on this side of the Atlantic. I am glad this was the last beer I had that night, otherwise this is all I would have drank. Excellent stuff."
"Drinkability= It's good. Not what i expected though. Alcohol was noticeable which detracted somewhat from the overall experience."
"A solid, hefty brew, and it jumps headfirst into a deep pool of complexity, yet stays approachable even for the timid beer geek. The rosemary character and raisin tone really works here."
"75cl bottle from the 2008 release. A surprisingly loud pop accompanies the removal of the cork. The last couple LA bottles that I've had have been a bit too low on carbonation, but this one seems to have conditioned quite nicely, exhibiting a medium-high level of small bubbles. Nice. the color is dark brown with a creamy beige head that sticks around and never completely retires. The aroma has rich dried fruits with raisin being noticeable. There is also a funky, lightly tart edge, plenty of spices, (is that the rosemary?) slightly under-ripe pears and a hint of cocoa powder. A complex and intriguing concoction. The flavor is not quite as impressive but is nice nonetheless. Lightly sweet chocolate mixes with lots of spice, a light fruity tartness, and ends with a dry alcoholic bite. The body is medium with plenty of carbonation. I'd say this is a pretty complex and interesting dark farmhouse ale. There is a lot going on, but it comes together in a sort of organized chaos that leaves a unique signature on the tongue."
"D-An amazingly complex brew but it actually leaves to palate fatigue! Also, the alcohol does lead itself to booziness. A very good brew to enjoy sipped out of a snifter."
"Pours a dark brown, about like Coca-Cola, with a small tan head. The smell is spicy, with some honey and raisins. I think I also may smell rosemary, but if I didn't read on the bottle that it was included in the beer I doubt I would have picked it out. The flavor is more of the same, with dark fruit and honey being the two main flavors. The aftertaste is very spicy, which is where the rosemary and coriander flavors are present. A very good beer that is unlike anything I have tasted before. Certainly a beer that is not made to the style guidelines, but still very tasty."
"- Perfectly carbonated.... and tastes rather good, and well planned. This is certainly a top notch, sweet n' sour of sorts."
"this will not be my last lost abbey."
"Conclusion: Crazy interesting, complex, but not for the faint of heart and not something I'd drink all the time...still, definitely worth a try"
"This bottle has been in the cellar for at least a year. A corked 750ml bottle poured into my Duvel tulip glass. The ale appears the color of murky fresh brewed iced tea with about two fingers of creamy ecru colored foam. The head lingers until the glass is nearly empty. Nose and flavors consist of dark brown sugar, molasses, raisins, prunes, dates, rich caramel, sweet biscuits, yeast, figs, dark cherry skins. Between medium and full bodied for the style with adequate carbonation levels. Quite tasty."
"D - I am finding the full body, high carbonation and strong flavors are not mixing so well."
"Overall: Nice beer to try. Very special taste, nicely balanced sweet-bitterness. In general however, I think it is a bit overdone in the flavors, it seems a bit like a bigger-better-faster attitude beer to me. The brewers tried to get too many flavors in the beer, just because some people like complexity (in terms of number of flavors). But don't misunderstand me, still a terrific beer. But will I buy it again, no, there are many better American beers!"
"D: Not bad, but the taste is all over the place. Not complex but a little overdone ingredient-wise. Might have been more interesting with a full body."
"Drinkability: with the overall booziness of this beer it is one to savor over a long session. But flavorwise it is interesting."
"M&D - lively on the the tongue, like it has a slightly sour characteristicm but its cloyingly sour, very tasty"
"Drinkability is excellent, with the only downside being the rosemary that tends to wear on the palate. Alcohol adds to the flavors instead of dominating or interfering, and the beer and mouthfeel are both excellent. Very impressed."
"There is a nice mouthfel and incredibly drinkable for its abv."
"Interesting, I liked this, not sure if I will have a bunch of these, just so much going on"
"HV"
"On tap this past Friday at the Other Side Cafe. Served in a tall thin glass (8 oz?) for $7.50. A bit steep, but I wanted to try it. Dark brown, almost black, in color. No head to speak of. Smelled of alcohol and dried fruits. Taste was complex. Layers of fruit, followed by layers of oakiness, then sugar, then more alcohol. I can see why this beers is sold in small servings. Could have been a bit thicker in the mouthfeel. Tasty and nice to drink. Yet, for the price I paid, I was expecting to be blown away, and I was not."
"if you like the taste of dark fruits and chocolate or a really good beer, then seek out this Lost Abbey beer. Rule 1-Thou shall not drink a whole growler by thee self."
"Drink is a little heavier than usual it does go down rather easily for how heavy it tastes. If that makes sense."
"Ten Commandments is a dark beer with a deep dark burgandy brown with no light shining through whatever. Ten has a nice sturdy tan head that produces silky lace down the glass. This one smells swwet with malts and burnt sugars. Some dark fruits and alcohol round the smell out. Wow, the taste is sweet bordering on too much. A big bready yeast component along with dark fruits and sweet malts are the focus on taste. A full feel with light carb and some alcohol to go with it. Would like to see what a aged bottle with carb would do to this beer, but for now the tap version will do, even though it's not my favorite."
"Taste is very dark fruits, lots of raisin flavor. Very nice. The carbonation is a little high, I would like it just a bit lower to smooth it out. Very good beer."
"D: Pretty smooth drinking."
"a bit of cocoa on the pallete cantalope there too. Light fine bubbled carbonation. Silky mouthfeel somewhat off dry finish"
"I'm surprised at the quality of 10 Commandments. I've had this beer before and it was dead flat. That was from the '09 bottling though. Lost Abbey has disappointed me so often over the last year a good beer from them seems to be the exception. With all that rambling done, if you can find an '08 bottle of 10 Commandments around it is definitely worth picking up. Thanks, Bill!"
"D- right now, one bottle was plenty. it seemed to kind of drag on towards the end. ill check back on this one in a few years to see how it develops. another lost abbey product that showed no signs of quality control issues."
"D - Interesting dark farmhouse ale with an intensely complex flavor profile. It was certainly fun to pull out all of the flavors and aromas in this brew."
"D: This one kinda grew on me as I drank more of the glass. The cherries are prominent and it's kinda nice. This is a sipper if I ever drank one, which is just as well because the flavor develops a lot in your mouth. There's a lot of warming with this one, and the alcohol certainly is as you would expect. Not much else to say...solid brew but I dunno if I'd go out of my way to find it."
"This is another interesting installment in the LA beer library with an interesting mix of dark fruits. It's definitely drinkable for the ABV, though the rosemary starts to build up over time and may be a little much for me."
"This is a one of a kind beer for me. I don't think I've ever had anything like this. Very nice."
"My first beer from Lost Abbey and I am very impressed. This one is quite complex and it's almost like two beers in one the way it starts off sweet/fruity and ends up dark with molasses and whiskey flavors!"
"Blipped ""10 Commandments of Ska"" by Prince Buster"
"Drinkability is above average for the style, but not by a lot. This is a really complex, intense beer, and half of a 750 was plenty to keep me satisfied and engaged over 45 minutes or so."
"D- Very good beer in which I don't get tired of the flavor at any point."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied and smooth with a strong bite of carbonation."
"D - Higher ABV makes this one a slow sipper, and the the somewhat nondescript character of this brew makes it something I don't feel an overwhelming urge to revisit. It's nice, but I'd much prefer a Rochefort..."
"Im definitely dissapointed with this."
"This is quite good; in some respects similar to Judgment Day but much more complex, and a notch better imo. Another winner from Lost Abbey."
"The flavor is equally sweet and sour. I can't say I've ever tasted anything quite like this. The closest approximation is Anchor's holiday beer, pumped up on steroids. A bit spicy and peppery, with notes of ginger and coriander. Lots going on. Roasty, toffee malt. Finishes rather dry, sour and spicy, with a bit of an alcohol burn. Body is a bit on the thin side, with supercharged carbonation that left my eyes tearing on the first sip."
"Overall, I really like the concept behind this beer with the unique ingredients. It definitely has potential, I just think that the rosemary completely dominated the flavor. After a while, I sort of lost touch with the other flavors in the beer because my taste buds were wiped out. I really want to see this beer toned down a bit, I bet it would quite good."
"Drinkability- Well two things I usually don't like in my beer; raisins and honey. Gave this a shot anywho and enjoyed the shit out of it. I think the Brett character was perfect for my liking and couldn't have picked a better time to enjoy. Thanks for the opportunity Matt!"
"I for sure recconmend this beer! Although it was not my favortie Lost Abbey beer"
"Poured into a chalice a deep brown color, nice carbonation, nice fizzy one-finger off-white head, with some nice sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, slight yeast, dark fruits, and a hint of rosemary. The taste is sweet, malty, with some yeast notes, nice touch of raisins, figs, plums, nice little touch of rosemary. Medium body, the ABV is hidden very well. Drinkable, this is a very nice brew, thanks Ben."
"D - Doesn't really do it for me. Fun to try, though. Maybe if more carbed?"
"Edit: I am really sensing the rosemary as I near the end of the bottle, especially in this green woody aftertaste. I happen to love rosemary though and do not think it's harsh or unpleasant."
"Overall a very unique brew that I don't think I would drink alot of because it is so unique. Good though."
"Thou shalt enjoy this Belgian Strong Dark Ale from The Lost Abbey."
"As a note, this is my first Lost Abbey beer that I found worse then good. That means it deserves a second chance and I will update my review when I re-review it."
"Malty and earthy, with chocolate being the prominent characteristic. Roasty chocolate, with a slight dark fruity presence like cherry or raisin. Big, malty and bready. Little bit of coffee also. Little bit of hop kick at the end but nothing overwhelming. Despite the initial sensations, this seems to be a pretty lowly carbonated beer, very sticky, very cloying, and the roastiness lingers on the palate. Drinkability suffers a bit because it is a bit boozey, on top of what is a pretty complicated beer to begin with. It's a sipper, but a damn good one. For anyone a fan of dark Belgians, this is most definitely worth a try."
"Hmmm... an interesting beer. My 2008 edition poured a fat, 1 1/2-inch head. It was virtually black, more so than Westy 12/Rochefort 10/etc. Smells of sour cherries, raisins, and spicy phenols. Boozy taste -- my only big problem with it. But getting past that, this is a very complex beer that follows up with a cascade of delightful flavors -- again, sour cherries, raisins, candi sugar, cloves, bread and a beautiful hop bittering to balance the sweet complexity. Tight bubbles in the mouth, smooth and creamy. Drinkability gets better the closer I come to the bottom of the 750-ml bottle. As it warms and flattens, I desire more and more. This is by far the best American example of a Belgian-style Strong Dark I've had. Not quite on par with Westy, but probably surpassing Rochefort 10. Nice, nice, nice work."
"D- This is a nice, quite complex, BSDA. This beer would have a lot more potential if the carbonation had come through. The 9% is detectable but not ridiculous or out of check in anyway. An overall nice beer by the Lost Abbey"
"A ridiculously-flavored concoction. Pleasant, but nearly indescribable. I have never tasted an ale of such flavors. Here's my best attempt: herbal, roundedly-sweet, minimally-spiced, and touched with citrus. Actually, it's really tasty and pleasant...so, go out and buy two of these!"
"A unique and tasty hybridization of Belgian styles; another fine beer in the Lost Abbey roster."
"Very dark brown almost opaque. A nice tan head accompanied the pour and then quickly dissipated. Sweet honey as well as thick malt and spices in the smell. Robust malt flavors as well as a molasses flavor in the front with a spicy clove or ginger or cinnamon followed by a touch of alcohol after it leaves the palate. This drink finishes dry compared the initial taste of the beer. While this is a very fine ale, I doubt I would have more than one in a sitting."
"D - Good and enjoyable. Probably good to age. As it warms the funk comes out."
"Pours a dark cola color that becomes murkier the closer you wander towards the bottom of the bottle. The shallow light tan loose foamy collar is more of an 'extra' than a 'supporting' character; less than a finger when poured aggressively...fades quickly without much of a trace. Wow, the smell is another story...quite substantial, rich, earthy and malty...suggesting a brew of substance awaits with dark fruit, molasses and chocolate. The mouth feel playing a key role; medium-light body, smooth and creamy....with a killer coating characteristic that sustains the flavor's starring performance well after the swallow. Big on taste...the licorice, chocolate, molasses and spicy cinnamon flavors are deep and intense...i'm talk'in about a ton of quality ingredients going into this baby. This is without a doubt one of the best (read as personal favorites) Belgian Strong Dark Ales that i've had the opportunity to consider. At 9% ABV, while there is a nice hint of warmth...the drinkability is world class. An incredible product...well within expected interpretation of the style and hugely 'in-your-face' substantial nose, flavors and supporting texture combination make this one stand 'head & shoulders' above the rest. VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!! I give it huge scores for overall experience."
"750 shared courtesy of dirtylou during the countdown to my departure from madison :("
"drinkability: good"
"Definately a beer that benefits from some time in the cellar. This batch may peak in another two years or so."
"Poured a deep murky brown with a thick tan head that clings to the glass. Nose is lots of dried fruits and maybe even some cinnamon plums and nice cinnamon taste to it. Taste starts dried fruits, sweet, syrup, roasted nuts. Very complex. Mouthfeel was nice. ABV well hidden. Great brew by Lost Abbey. If you love this style this is your beer!"
"I had tried this before, and thought I liked it a lot more than when I had it this time. It'd definitely a different brew, but one I probably won't seek out to purchase with its higher price tag."
"Finish is long and a tad alcoholic."
"Unfortunately, I do not seem to appreciate most of these Lost Abbey experiments. Another miss, in my opinion, immensely inferior to the style classics."
"Drinkability- Not a great Belgian strong dark, but tasty all te same. Probably be much better after a year in the old beer cellar."
"7/4/7.5/3/16/3.8"
"Pour a very dark brown with a nice tannish head with good Belgian lacing. Aroma is very complex, its sweet, spicey and has a hint of higher alcohol to it. Flavor is very well balanced with lots of fruity raiseny notes. A big beer that is balanced well. Not hoppy. A good example of a Belgian style beer."
"Really excited to let one of these cellar for a while, a great offering from LA, thought it could have had bigger flavors overall but damn tasty."
"Dark, thick brown with yeast sediment and a thick tan head. Raisins, dark fruits, yeast, coriander, and malt in the nose. Little to no carbonation, silky mouthfeel. Roasted malt and chocolate prevalent up front, then turn to muted raisins and bready malt. Sourdough, cocoa, and a vinous grape flavor finish. Unbelievable beer."
"taste is sweet up front, raisins, grapes, prunes, spice, some cocoa, sour malt, finishes nicely, the sweetness dies down a bit and the fruit flavors come through."
"The more I drink this and the more it warms the more drinkable I think it is. At first the flavors were a little strong, but the more I sip the more I enjoy the complexity."
"Certainly on the roasty and explicitly malty side for a BSDA, but I'm no style stickler. Good interesting beer, I enjoyed this."
"One of the most enjoyable brews I've had from the Lost Abbey for sure."
"After a dissapointing experience with judgement day, I was a bit reluctant to fork out another $10 on this bottle. But I sure am glad I did. It pours a rich brown with a thin but silky tan head. The nose has dark malts, ripe fruits, honey, rosemary, spices and peppery yeasts. The taste builds on the nose with rich bready malts and a delicious blend of honey, rosemary and other spices. Full body has perfect carbonation. A fantastic beer."
"Drinkability: This is a very wine-like beer and is a very different beer. Drinkable, but not my favorite for the style. I enjoyed trying it but it took me a while to get through the bottle, no need to try it again. Probably should be aged"
"This beer is quite similar in taste to ""underlig jul"" by Nögne. A perfect beer for christmas! I like!"
"One of the most wine-like beers I've had, and though that's usually not a compliment coming from me, I thought this was very interesting and good. Pours deep red with almost no head. Aromas of Belgian floral and some fruity herbiness (I don't know what rosemary tastes or smells like!) Very drinkable (again, not always a plus) with a nice balance of raisins, honey, that pervasive Belgian floral quality, and herbiness. An interesting and largely successful experiment, and a delicious change of pace."
"This beer has notes of greatness that seem to get overpowered by the herbal notes found in this beer. I'd be curious to see how this one will age in the bottle."
"below average. The combination of raisins, honey, and rosemary just did not convince me that this is a worthy beer. I tried it regardless with four other co-workers and the general unanimous vote was negative. no sense of rosemary, overly raisin, and the honey only draws sweetness to this beer. I was not impressed by this beer at all, an overrated ale that was just disappointing."
"Notes from 5/11/08"
"Would have more if I could find this."
"D: I HATE belgian style sweet beers with a passion. I avoid them 99% of the time but for some reason this one is working for me and I would likely seek this one out on rare occasions."
"Dark burgandy body. The brown head is very thin. Lace is spotty and sporadic. Aroma is deep and complex. Some sherry notes and some port notes. A little rice vinegar. Some spicing is duly noted, with rosemary and ginger hints. The flavor is quite complex as well. The first thing I DON'T notice for a 9% beer is the alcohol. Very nicely hidden and integrated in the grand scheme of things. The body feels more like a sherry with a bit more carbonation. The taste resembles sherry and port as well. This is a true sipper. Not because it's alcoholic, but rather because it's so good, you want it to last. Plum, fig and raisin notes add levels of depth. Rosemary is ghostly in its presence, but somehow, I feel it. (One of my favorite beers was their SPF 8 (with Rosemary) which I tasted at the pub in 2002.) This beer is a real treat."
"D: At 9% the beer is a whopper. I'll nurse my bottle into the early evening and be happy with it."
"D- Not bad. The odd ingredients all mingle surprisingly well."
"d: I like this beer, but it is almost flat which really kills the experience."
"Quite drinkable for 9.0%. Very appropriate for fall/holiday drinking. The spicing and mouthfeel will lend this nicely to hearty meals or as an after dinner treat."
"Pours a murky brown with very little head. The aromas open up as the beer warms, and although I didn't smell any Rosemary to begin with, it is definitely noticeable after a bit as are aromas of honey, roots, brown sugar and a funky sourness in thge background. Pretty nice and pretty unusual. The taste is also heady with rooty herbs, light sourness, cola, sugar, and other interesting forest notes. Hard to figure out and the sourness in the background is a very interesting. Smooth and easy to drink."
"Great drinkability, the ABV is well hidden. This is one I could sit by fire with until the wee hours or I get sleepy... One I will stockpile at some point..."
"M&D: full bodied brew, with a lower carbonation rate than expected. smooth and mellow rather young, not surprising from Lost Abbey."
"Drank this last night, no notes. I thought it was rather complex and interesting tastes, but frankly, nasty. It resembled sweat/BO, and urine. The rosemary was somewhat interesting, the flavor mostly malt balanced, and the appearance dark and okay, but the flavor just didn't appeal to me whatsoever."
"This opens up a great deal with a bit of warmth. It's got a lot going on here...very complex nose and palate with a great deal of depth. Hopefully I can keep a couple downstairs for a while and revisit to see how this fine offering evolves."
"D - This beer is undrinkable. It seems like it was released way too early, or the bottle conditioning was just done poorly. Avoid."
"Over all it was a pretty enjoyable drink but probably wouldn't go for a second round with this Lost Abbey."
"Proper carbonation would raise these grades dramatically."
"Cheers"
"Upon warming: This is basically a dark wild ale. Amazing."
"Drinkability. I really like this beer and it has a great drinkability especially for a 9% AVB. I hope as it ages the brett/sour comes out more and the roastiness fades a little."
"Note: revised my review based on the 2012 version to add the comments about the Brett - also would note that the carbonation issues appear to be resolved"
"Bottom line: I like the flavours here, kind of reminds me of an Oud Bruin, but the lack of carbonation and the strong presence of alcohol limit the drinkability for me."
"Taste & mouthfeel: The first sip presents an almost overwhelming amount of complexity, though at no point does this become cloying; it's just a bit confusing at first. Dates and raisins meet a spicy kick, following that a hint of wild honey and molasses. Herbal bitterness is present as well, almost reminiscent of Angostura bitters. The finish is fruity yet fairly dry and spicy, leaving a lingering herbal note on the tongue along with a touch of fig. Carbonation is low throughout, but not missed, and the texture is decidedly thick. For such a complex beer, this is very drinkable. Great stuff fresh, but I can see this batch improving drastically in 2 or 3 years."
"D- Despite the fact that there is no carbination this is easy to drink."
"D- I was a little worried with a whole growler of this. I recently did a whole gowler of Judgement Day and that was hard to finish on my own. I don't anticipate that being the case here. This is lower on the LA hype scale. I didn't even know about the change in it this year. Despite that, I still put this up near the top of my favorite LA releases."
"D: Definitely a sipper, The 9% ABV doesn't come on too strong until it warms a bit."
"It's a bit difficult to review this one as I've never had a beer quite like this one before."
"Drinkability: Had to pour out the remainder of this one. This should be sold in smaller bottles. Having no option but to buy this in 750 ml is ridiculous."
"Overall, an interesting brew. Not sure what category this falls into, but I appreciate the constant experimentation of Lost Abbey. On second taste, I think this one misses the mark a little bit"
"Wow, haven't rated this beauty. Pour is a very dark brown with a perfectly forming head of a very light tan. The head is airy, frothy, well developed and very pure and authentic...very Belgian. Perfect appearance because it looks Belgian. Nose is very expressive and lively and mainly shows the spicing (ginger, pumpkin, allspice), but it also hints of raisins, dark fruits, wildness and Belgian yeast. Flavor is very well balanced with all the elements working well together. Spicing is still the dominant factor, but the flavor still gives hints of raisins, dark fruits, herbs and yeast. Like it quite a bit, but it has aged slow."
"The Lost Abbey has given us their own stone tablet of 10 Commandments on the rear label. My favorite is the 9th... ""Life is about choices. The Lost Abbey is a great choice"". Amen to that."
"M/D: Full bodied, creamy, smooth. Very nice mouthfeel. Drinkability is fine, a really good beer. Taste is slightly off balance in my opinion, but that's about it."
"Overall this was an outstanding beer, though not my favorite from Lost Abbey, still better then most others. A good and different twist on the style, I would love to try this on tap and will be looking forward to purchasing this year's bottle."
"This one poured a dark brown with beautiful clear ruby highlights and a dense cap of light tan foam. Solid sheets of fine bubbles gave way to streakier lacing as the glass was emptied. Great head retention. Aromas of raisins, rum and a bit of chocolate. Gingerbread, figs, orange zest and caramel appeared as it warmed. Sweet up front, lots of malt depth here, followed by a bit of spicy character and rum soaked raisins. Candied oranges and a hint of cherry came forward towards the end and it finished with bread, figs and alcohol warmth, plus a little bitterness. Rich, creamy texture, full bodied but not heavy, with well-integrated carbonation and a slight stickiness. Quite drinkable. Delicious! This is great stuff, try it if you can get your hands on it."
"Drinkability- This is what I pictured Judgment Day tasting like...maybe it does if you don't get a bad bottle. Good flavor in this one and a nice one to sip over a good hour or two."
"Not my favorite beer from Lost Abbey but above average for its style, did not think it was as good as friends had been saying it was, probably would not drink again for this price, interested to see how Cuvee de Tomme tastes since this is the base beer for it, worth trying though"
"D: Quite drinkable."
"Lots of raisins in there, i think 10% of the ingredients. Muddy dark looking with soapy head. Sour in the finish. Lots of lace. Alcohol in the nose. Nice caramel, sugar, dark fruit, rum-ness,chocolate, coffee. Good drinkability, albeit a sipper. The ageing didn't hurt."
"Pours a deep dark ruby brown with good head. good head is always a plus. Smell is very much dark fruits with some alcohol and maltiness. Taste follows, rich dark fruit and raisin, sugar and some alcohol. a unique taste. mouthfeel is on the thin side for a BSDA, and drinkability is good, but could be better. Overall a fine beer, but not anything crazy exciting."
"unfortunately, this was the highlight of the evening. even the paired dish (scallops with side of flan) was a slight mismatch, with the flan being too sweet and cancelling out the subtleties of the brew. but this is not a review of the dinner..."
"Overall: Good, tasty, fun, not amazing. Something I'd probably buy again, but not something I'd drive around to search out."
"I was surprised to see this one was absolutely black with a one finger tan colored head that dies down to a thin layer of creamy bubbles. Stickiness is pretty good, some thick lacing here and there. Scent is sweet raisins with a good amount of caramel malt. Roasted nut aromas with cherries and raspberries. A good amount of pepper and spice find their way in the nose as well. Malty goodness on the tongue up front. A surprising sour tang with a toasted almond flavor. Black licorice and dark chocolate taste towards the end with a somewhat dry effect. Medium body with a silky smooth texture. Carbonation is pretty minimal, but I like how it feels. I really like this beer, and I'm not exactly a big fan of Belgians either. A good beer to share as are most from Lost Abbey. Definitely a must try in my books."
"D- I really like this beer. It is a sweet one though so I am not sure I could drink a ton of it. Plus it is 9% alcohol which isn't too hidden."
"Pours a murky dark brown with a small creamy tan head. Lot of lacing. Aroma of molasses, spice, raisin and some alcohol. Early hit of prune and raisin with a sweet and earthy/grainy mid and a slightly funked and alcoholic finish. Medium body. Cooked raisins unusually means doom for me... pleasantly surprised by this."
"Enjoyed from the bottle. Aroma is of chocolate, caramel, raisins, and roasted malt with very little hop aroma. A hint of vanilla reveals its presence. A small tan head appears but lasts for a short time.There is not much lacing on the glass and the beer looks viscous and syrupy. The beer is a very dark brown (nearly black) with a deep mahogony tint. medium sweetness, lightly bitter, lightly sour, medium body, average carbonation, sticky, creamy, long finish. The taste is vanilla, raisins, a little funky, chocolate. The finish is complex, ending with some bitterness at the back of the tongue. Very interesting beer and thoroughly enjoyable."
"This a very pleasant smelling and tasting Belgian Strong Ale but make no mistake, it's still one powerful and filling beer that definitley requires some serious sipping. Sit back with it for a couple of hours and enjoy."
"Pours a dark brown, almost black color with a good 1/2 inch of creamy tan head with good retention and great lacing. Smells of dark fruits (which I'd suspect) along with citrus blossoms, toffee, and chocolate. Tastes start out big with the dark fruits like grape and black cherry as well as spices like coriander. Some brown sugar mixes with chocolate covered raisins to finish off the taste. Alcohol presence as it warms. Medium in body with good carbonation and a dry finish. Another good beer from Port Brewing, but I don't know if I would want to drink a whole one by myself, especially with the strong alcohol coming out."
"I would say this beer has a nice complexity, although in the same manner it's hard to tell what the brewer was going for. Definitely a unique beer worth trying if you can..."
"Pours to a evil shade of blackish brown that is very intriguing. The head is a brown tan mix of one inch short bubbles that lasts a couple of minutes. Nose shows hints of sour cherries and alchol soaked maltiness. On first sip you get a dark fruit smoothness and a dry dark malty feel. The mouthfeel that is created is sligthly bitter with a large amoutn of dryness that dances on the edge of richness. This beer does have hints of sweetness but its more like dark chocolate, bakers coco, and sour cherries. Nicely drinkable, but for the right time only. Light a fire, turn off the lights and hope for a long cold night."
"750ml bottle which cost me $10 from Hi-Time Wine Cellars. I shared this with a friend which was good given the strength. The color was dark brown with no head and no carbonation. Smells slightly sour, licorice, alcohol. It took awhile to taste the raisins but they are there. Another interesting beer from Lost Abbey."
"drinkable?: no, it is hard and painful to drink!"
"Beer poured a deep mahogany with a light brown head. Nose is a wonderful medley of fruits, raisins, Belgian Yeast, and other spices. Taste is quite nice, of light and dark fruits, malts, raisins, and burnt sugar. Finish is lightly hoppy with a warming alcohol burn. Mouthfeel is very good with that yeast making this especially effervesant across my palate. Drinkability is good and tasry but at 9.0 abv it is a whopper."
"Bottle. Poured similar to a ValDieu I had a few weeks back, nice brown with small head. Aroma suggests some raisin and brown sugar. The flavor is not as sweet as the aroma. A real good full flavor that has great malt balance and a really long lasting coated flavor all over my mouth. Lost Abbey continues to impress!"
"D: I'm quite disapointed. This one either lacks depth in flavor, or the alcohol is covering it all up. Perhpas this one will improve with age, but right now, it's pretty difficult to drink."
"Poured from 750ml caged bottle into New Belgium snifter. Poured a dark brown almost to the point of black with a thick lacy head. Smells of raisins and dark fruits with spice aroma. Taste of malt, raisins, spiced bread, dates and plums. Mouthfeel is thick and sweet with a nutty dry finish. The alcohol is present but not overpowering for a abv of 9%. But still a meal of a beer and this beer will fill you up."
"After removing the cage and cork from the 750ml bottle it pours a deep rich mahogany color, the tan head forms a large crown upon the body, as the creamy head dissipates, the lace forms a concealing blanket upon the glass. Nose is rich in fruit like aromas, raisins come to mind, nice malt tones also there, caramel hints present, and start has a pleasing malt profile, sweet with a hint of spicy bitterness, top medium in feel. Finish has a personable hop spicy bite, nicely acidic, quite dry and long lasting aftertaste, a good brew, and well worth a sample."
"Aftertaste is slightly citrus bitterness with some hot alcohol and lots of alcohol warmth going down."
"D- 9% abv is well-masked, but this definitely a sipping beer to be enjoyed over time (much like a port or desert wine). Think of this as a bigger, bolder, more complex version of Lost & Found supercharged on raisins and dark fruits, great for low-key and/or cold fall and winter evenings . . ."
"Smooth and chewy mouthfeel that finishes very dry. Yet another great beer from Lost Abbey. This would pair well with a dark chocolate."
"Gets a bit overbearing after a while, and not a good session beer."
"A meal in itself. Hardly had any room for dinner. :)"
"Poured in a heavy glass chalice, formed a 1/2"" tan head over the slightly cloudy burgundy brew. Lacing is substantial and lasting. Aroma is balanced with malt sweetness and dark fruit. Taste is actually pretty sedate, sticks with the nose indication of moderate grains coupled with ample but reined in fruitiness. Mouthfeel is out-of-control smooth, and drinkability is very nice as well. Another nice one from the Abbey."
"This brew pours a dark deep brown that appears black at first sight. It leaves a thick tan head that clings to the glass. The aroma is prunes, figs, plums, dark pitted fruit, caramel, spicy, cinnamon, cardomon, great nose. The taste starts fruity sweet, syrup, dark toffee, espresso, roasted nuts, def herbal presence that finishes bitter almost like under ripened fruit. This is another solid brew from The Lost Abbey, I like where this beer took me."
"Drinkability: Congratulatory comments flew from drinker to drinker before even the first glass had been emptied."
"Last swigs: Full bodied and unforgiving spiced raisin sandpaper. DogFish Head Raison D'Etre with malt."
"Belgian bomber, caged and corked, w/o freshness or brewing date indication, pours rich, dark, dark brown, thick dark tan head, film initially spotty lacing and then more full lacing and intricate sheeting. Nose is boldly of rum soaked raisins, dark fruits and alcohol. One sip and I am in BSDA heaven...rich, flavorful, complex, heady brew....bold flavors carry through towards a mellow smoldering long finish...figs, rum, dark candi sugars, moderate alcohol present. Luxiourously smooth, coating and easy on the old tongue. Not for beginners, but big ,Belgian lovers will rejoice...Go get some. Savor and enjoy this stunner."
"750mL Bottle. Aroma runs with nice caramelization, raisins, plums and fig wine. Bits of rising herbal quality come amount with a fog of crisp spicing. Lightly warming, bold and flowing. Pours a tinted mahogany, with a creamy dark mauve head. Flavor is a gently balanced dark sugar, brimming with raisin residuals, candy cream, bits of turkish delight and bioflavinoids. Theres a dose of tannic tongue twinging. Currants and gooseberries perk up the background through a little earth and bark. Fragrant and warm. This will be insanity when the Brett actually starts to show up."
"D: Very drinkable for a beer of this magnitude. Another great offering from Port Brewing/The Lost Abbey, I can't wait to see what they do in the future."
"Bottle courtesy of Naven: Poured a cloudy dark brown/burgundy color ale with a nice big light brown foamy head with great retention and good lacing. Aroma of dry raisins and dry figs is very enjoyable Taste is a well balance mix between some sweet malt with nice dry raisins and figs characteristics with a subtle yeasty finish. Body is full with some great carbonation and no alcohol could be detected. I thought this was similar to Chimay blue or Achel extra bruin and presents a very nice level of complexity. It is definitely something I wish I could get my hand on more often."
"My first Lost Abbey, and the wait was worth it. Now, on to more!"
"The first sip confirms all that I smelled above. Lots of molasses, raisins, and other dark fruity scents. Lots of boozy, dark fruity notes. Medium to full body, sits in the mouth nicely. A bit of toasty malt, and some oak is in there as well. This really is a great tasting beer, full of flavor. Normally a beer I would drink in the fall or winter with a nice stew or roast, but it actually paired quite well with some grilled tuna w/wasabi and soy sauce and a cucumber/mint salad."
"Not a bad drinker though I really prefer a sweeter version of this beer style. The low carbonation and the cork seal are a worry though, I don't think that this beer will last long in storage in its current bottling."
"This is a very impressive beer from Port Brewing."
"What a consummately defined, sipping brew; this is definitely a dessert type beer that fits quite well as a night ending brew. This is going to be very interesting to see how the Brett character effects this brew over time. It is very, richly fruited right now, and a bit more funky Brett character is only going to make this more interesting; I can't wait. Currently this is very enjoyable, but not quite funky enough, I can only hope that this is going to get exponentially better and given that this is quite tasty right now, well that is a very good thing."
"Notes: Interesting for sure. More balanced than most I've had in this style while still holding true. I'd put this somwhere between good and excellent. Worthy of a pickup but lost abbey wont get much of my money based on price versus competitors. The competitors are half the price and arguably equals."
"D- This is a excellent brew. I love the big raisin flavor that comes through."
"D: Darn tasty beer. I love the strong seasonings but I cant help to wonder how the beer would mellow with some time on its hands."
"Very malty full-body taste, complex sweetness obvious from the raisins but also from the malts. Not balanced but probably intentional. Beer gave a good kick within 20 minutes of me finishing it haha. A very interesting beer that I would love to try again if I could get over the sticker shock."
"Overall: I really like this beer. I like every beer from Lost Abbey. Everyone should try this one."
"The taste being much like the smell, this stuff has a wonderful spicy flavor, much like a Christmas Ale to the likes of Anchor's seasonal brew. A nice little burnish on the tongue with a sweet, spicy lingering finish with some warming. A nice complex flavor with good body and plenty of punch...super velvety mouthfeel all add up to a super drinkable, festive brew with an uncompromised quality. This beer is brewed with much passion...more so than anything else. Happy Anniversary!"
