"13mo bottle. Heavy oak, light on the dark fruit. Great nose, fluffy feel. One of the better bruins out there."

"Dag this is sour.  Quite sour"
"Fairly clear deep reddish gold color. Fruity spicy light earth. Nice brew, thanks Mike."

"Pours a healthy two finger head, dark tan in hue, the large percentage of bigger bubbles creates a mottled surface, thick globs of lacing left behind. Deep brown colored liquid, cleaner than expected but too dark for transparency, basically wall-to-wall active bubbles too thick to form single beads. The nose definitely betrays a sour, grapey side, clears a path for the thicker, sweeter milk chocolate, scone, molasses and plum, cherry to raisin, prune fruit scents, there is a palpable “sour bois” funk to it, bark, leaves and black tea leaves as well as a modicum of grapefruit pith, truly needs to get close to room temperature to really open up and shine. Full-bodied, needs all that carbonation to prevent it from congealing although, truthfully, it is more pinpoint prickles than foaminess. Minerals, damp earth and sour grapefruit have the speed to get in there before the chocolate, sweet baking spices, yeast and baking dough, root beer and cola bean notes. As a result, the moments of sweetness are deep but not long lived. Same blend of cherry, raisin, date fruit, more concentrated than sweet. Finishes on a metallic note. Sometimes it is annoying when a beer zigs and zags on you, here it just makes you like it more."

"Warm and full of dark fruit flavors like that is expressed in the aroma, bready and spicy. Medium bodied."

"Deep amber rose color.  Smell is amazing hints of sweet and funk.  Taste is cherry earth and oaky funk.  Some nice hints of sweet fruit.  Bitter and dry mouth feel.  Finish is more earth and dryness.  A wonderful sour. Highly recommend."

"Overall a fun and amazing example of the BSDA style.   Great looking with a spicy and sweet taste with an amazing carbonation.  Highly recommended to all fans of the style and unique Belgian ales.  This is the business."

"One solid ass brew! Highly recommended, i'll be back for more at $6/per. Price is right for cellaring."
""

"It finishes decidedly on the dry side. Very very good."
""
""
"Flavor. Fruity; slightly tartness with a touch of sweetness and bitterness. Moderately strong and mildly funky flavor seems to reflect red wine barrel aging."

"solid, flavorful representation of the style. slightly too heavy on the yeast, but enjoyable nonetheless. I can see this as a nice brew during the colder months -- touches of dark fruits and yeast with a tickling carbonation."

"somewhere between a belgian dubbel and belgian strong dark, this is incredible beer, one of the more dynamic and well built examples of the style and even the country i have seen. on tap at bull and bush for a quite reasonable $8.50 per ten ounce. dark copper to magenta in color, weirdly tinted, but bright and clear with a tall and cool whip thick bone white head. the nose is stunning, malty and big, familiar in that regard, refined yet unique in yeast character, more spice than fruit, maybe dried fruit, and layered with complexities. the flavor is equally jarring, truly different this one. layers of mature and fresh grain alternate on waves of pillowy textured effervescence and just lasts for ever on the palate. golden raison to caramelized sugars to allspice, this is really flavorful, but very hard to describe because its spectrum is so foreign to me. there is some residual sugar in this, but i suspect the yeast has pretty close to finished up and 9% abv (thats what the menu listed anyway). de dolle beers have been hard to find for me, but i feel luck to have tried this one, i even bought a second one. my girlfriend was also extremely into this one, and her palate tired of beer some time ago. really different, huge body but so gentle in feel. this is some of the best belgian beer i have ever had."

"O: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, good kick, decent representation of style but seems more like a Flanders-style ale, it’s a solid beer to drink for a while."
" The flavor runs the gamut of spicy and cocoa oriented with a mild date-like nutty and earthy tobacco-esque fruity and light raisin with a mild rich sweet note like fig with earthy molasses in the background and dry spiced yeast with an almost peppery dry finish. Overall this is a wonderful strong Belgian brown -too bad it is hard to find frequently. I like the ease of drinking and you barely notice the 9.5% until the glass is empty"

"Interesting and diverse palate on this beer makes it worth a try."

"Pours a fairly clear caramel with a frothy cream head. Aroma is spicy, with notes of green apple, sharp prunes, dates, and figs resting on a bed of toasted caramel malt. The balance is sharply fruity. Flavor is much sweeter, with notes of plums that are eventually countered by tart cherry art the base. The finish is dry and lightly bitter."
""

"color is a clear, deep ruby. beer pours spotted lacing, aroma is rich and filled with dark fruit, belgian yeast, biscuit, mild spice. Taste is explosive with white cherries, plum, biscuit and clove. mouthfeel is quite light, but slightly cream, so the contrast is beautiful, carbonation is very low. overall this is an excellent and unique belgian experience."

"O: This beer is delicious and worthy of tasting. Lonely planet is often wrong but not on this one. Reminds me of Rochefort 8 or 10, but unique in itself. Got in Bruges near beer wall store ‘B2B’, drank Dec 7th, 2013 in Brussels."

"O: like a Belgian noel beer with an enhanced phenolic intensity, wild culture influence... De Dolle's ales have this strange balance, teetering on the edge of disaster; electric, dynamic fruity yeast character just saving many of their products"
""

"Haven't had this beer in a long time and it's nice to revisit it. The name translates to strong and wet which certaintly is true, but this beer is so much more than that. The aroma is complex suggesting dried fruits such as figs and raisins along with a very tawny character remiscent of port wine. There's even a hint of smoke. This smooth malt and sugar bomb has a tawny port character that carries through the taste of this beer along with some marzipan sweetness and a boozy finish. This is a beer I should have been drinking all winter. I may have to go back and get some more."
""
""

"D- Seemed too sweet and too effervescent for me. Maybe some time on this one helps it come together."

"330 ml bottle into tulip glass, bottled in 6/2013. Pours very hazy deep ruby red color with a fairly dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty foamy lacing clings on the glass, with a large amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of pear, apple, raisin, plum, fig, white grape, caramel, candi sugar, bread, clove, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good complexity of fruity/earthy yeast ester and balanced dark/candi sugar malt sweetness; with good strength. Taste of big raisin, plum, fig, pear, apple, white grape, caramel, bread, candi sugar, clove, herbal, light pepper, and yeast earthiness. Lingering notes of raisin, plum, pear, apple, fig, white grape, caramel, bread, candi sugar, clove, herbal, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice complexity of fruity/earthy yeast with a good amount of dark/bready malt sweetness; with a great malt/yeast balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a very smooth, crisp, and moderately slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent Belgian strong dark ale. All around great complexity and balance of fruity/spicy yeast and dark/bready malt sweetness; and very smooth to sip on for the ABV. A very enjoyable offering."

"Overall - So far every beer I've had from this brewer has been a winner. I'd like to have regular access to their offerings. A great tasting belgian dark ale."

"O: Not sure this would be a beer I would reach for very often, but I couldn't find much to complain about aside from personal preference. Glad to have tried it once at least."
""
"O: A really nice fruity BSDA. Well balanced with nice complexity. Not overly heavy on the belgian yeast character, which I feel can overpower some brews. Not too sweet, not too heavy either."
""
""

""

"Overall not my favorite brew although my first from De Dolle. Might just be an old bottle improperly stored. Would give it another chance but wouldnt seek it out."

"O/D-The nose beat out the flavor. I don't think I will ever truly love beers of this ilk. I can differentiate between ones I can mildly enjoy and ones I hate. This is one of the better ones."
""
""
"Bottled June 2013, poured August 2013. Pours a deep dark hazy reddish brown with a massive off white head. Took a while to get this whole beer into my glass. Aroma of plums and figs, cherries, pears, some hops, and lots of yeasty dryness. Flavor has a nice up front bitter that fades into prunes and yeast flavor. A bit of tart yeast lingers. Bubbly and prickly carbonation makes this lighter than I expected. Solid brew, though I like my Belgians a little sweeter than this. Nice balance overall."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, an interesting beer that is easily worth a sample."
""
""
""
"O - a nice BSDA. Enjoyed the fruitiness and typical Belgian flavors but nothing mind-blowingly good."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: An I interesting brew that I'd happily buy again but only to have someone else try it. Good fruit character stays with you for a while which I love. Overalls great clean and tasty brew."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-This is a fantastic beer. It has a unique tartness and cherry-cola component that plays really well with the more typical BSDA flavors of prune and raisin. The flavors are complex and the carbonated mouthfeel keeps things from feeling heavy or cloying. I will certainly seek this beer out again."

"Most impressive - a highly complex and fruity brew that calls to mind wine rather than beer. It looks the part, with an amazingly rich aroma and a flavour that is a shade more restrained. The body does the beer justice. The tart, oxidised element is subtle and deliciously subversive, adding depth to what would otherwise just be a strong, sweet brew. Truly a world-class example of the style; it should be on every beer-lover's essential list. Not to be passed up if you have the chance to try it."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Not what I expected but very nice nonetheless. The nose promises more than the taste can deliver, but the taste is still a delicious and different flavor profile I haven't encountered anywhere else."
""
""
"Oh man. This kills it. Insanely drinkable and unquestionably an ass-kicker. Just wish this was more accessible in PA. One love: De Dolle"
""
""
""
""
"O: A BSDA that's sour and hoppy? Interesting. A BSDA that's sour, hoppy, and isn't a clusterfuck? Now you have my attention. Okay, it doesn't work perfectly and isn't the most chuggable offering...but damn, it's just so much fun to sip and contemplate over."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall:This is the textbook definition of an all around ""very good"" beer. Everything about it was enjoyable, but there was nothing that really sent it into excellent or super memorable territory."

"Very complex beer that rapidly changes and reveals different flavors. Sensations intensify once it warms up. I had no idea what I would encounter once I hadn’t previously read about it, so it was a pleasant surprise. I highly recommend it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall it doesn't blow me away like the ""De Dolle Oerbier Special Reserva 2005"" since it kind of lacking in more sour cherry flavors, but it was totally worth picking up a 4 dollar old bottle of this Belgium sipper."
"O - Simply delicious. This is one of the most flavorful and well-rounded Belgian beers I've had. High drinkability, as the alcohol is masked well. This beer truly evolves as you drink it, awesome complexity."
""
""
""
""
"This is a medium bodied brew with just a bit exaggerated effervescent amount of carbonation. The bubbles here are a bit too extreme as they not only distract a bit from the feel but also bring a hint of carbonic quality to the nose. Initially the alcohol is nowhere to be found but all of a sudden it comes out in full force and becomes a dominating aspect of the brew. Opening this up ""fresh"" was a mistake, I should have reviewed one of my older bottles. Perhaps I will come back and update this review accordingly."
""
""
"Overall, an excellent Belgian dark strong ale, complex, dry and delicious. The 9% alcohol is not noticeable, so beware."
"Btw, the next time I watch a zombie movie and somebody yells ambush, their better be some amateur bush."
""
"O: This is one of my favorite Strong Dark Belgian Ales. Bitter and Sweet compliment each other perfectly and leaves a great aftertaste."
"Very tasty, try it out!"
"It was okay, but I was very disappointed considering the reviews. I'm wondering if maybe mine was just the wrong age (too old, too young)? I've had many of this style, and many great ones are at the top of my overall list, and this one didn't come anywhere near the complex greatness that my favorites have. Not bad, but certainly not great."
""
""
""
""
"Quite the experience, I was ready to pour it out at first because it was messy and strangely tart/metallic, but once it gets up to cellar temp it becomes a different beer. Indulgent and luxurious, warm and inviting. Will definitely be picking up more by De Dolle like everyone recommends!"
""
""
""
"Overall - I'm not quite sure what to think. I really wonder what it would taste like fresh, but I never see it down here. Next time I do, I'll pick it up and crack it open. I fear that age has just dried it out until it's nothing but yeast bi-products and the malt is having a difficult time shining through. I have to say, though, I'm still quite enjoying it, whatever it is."
"O - I've had the Reserva before having the base beer, and the Reserva seems to have much more of the yeasty sourness, which is largely lacking here. This is not a bad thing, as the beer itself has a lot going for it. The head retention adds a lot to both the appearance and mouthfeel, which definitely accentuates the overall experience. This beer is one I will look for in the future, another excellent offering from one of my favorite breweries."
"Bottled in 2011, poured into a wine glass. Dark brown pour, huge foamy head, takes some time to recede. Scents of brown sugar, whisky, malt, and an odd funkiness. Taste is quite different from the nose, suprisingly, notes of plum, light coffee, whisky, and oddly - carob, are most noticeable. It has a rather complex, slowly evolving mouthfeel. First are the sharp notes of whisky and dark fruit, then it quickly mellows into light coffee and carob. Well balanced mouthfeel, and thick but not too heavy with fine carbonation. The aftertaste lingers, where notes of roasted malt and minerals reveal themselves. I was really surprised by both this beers complexity and how much different the nose is from the taste. Highly recommended."
"Overall. Pretty nice beer for the style. I'd like to try a vintage bottle of this!"
"O-I was really excited to try another de dolle beer, but this wasn't what I was expecting at all. It tastes nothing like any other BDSA I've had. It actually reminds me more of a red Flanders. It's pretty well done. "
""
""
""
"Would go great with a nice beef stew, perhaps made with a bottle of Oerbier. Yum."
"jd"
""
"Overall, if you come across this beer during your travels, give it a shot."
"This is a winner, for sure. Nice interplay between chocolate & fruit, the alcohol level is really pleasing, right where it should be. Considering the last beer I had was a La Trappe Quad, I'm digging this a lot more. Maybe the age has something to do with it, but it's really even & smooth. Great stuff."
"O - Overall, disappointed with this one. Knew when I started to pour there was something not quite right with this. I assumed the age on this beer would be a good thing but I guess not. Really doesnt work for me."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The body was medium and the carbonation was medium-high, with a creaminess to the mouthfeel that was excellent. The bubbliness gave this beer life and the smooth creaminess rounded the feel out and prevented it from getting at all prickly. A top-notch beer all around. I’m looking forward to trying the Arabier next!"
""
""
""
"O: Due to the complexities in the smell and the taste, this is probably a better sipping beer than session beer - and the higher ABV does not really lend to making this a session beer. There is a light presence of alcohol in the smell and taste, especially as it warms up. This is the second time I have tried this beer and I think it is a really good one."
""
""
"330ml bottle. Oversized glass. Enjoyed on apr´12. Dark brown in color. Beige froth, lasting creamy & foamy crown. Intense floral fragancy, wet grass & heather aromas. Vinous with caramel malt hues. Pleasant flavor, spicy, sweet/sour, peppery with a warming ABV sensation. Full body, moderate carbonation. Sweet malty finish. Flavorful for a paused drinking moment."
""
""
"Pours a translucent russet color into my glass, with a large, fizzy, 'soda head' it recedes quite a bit but in general the beer seems to be staying carbonated constantly. There are no visible sediment grains. The aroma on this one is fantastic, like decadent baked goods. Sweet bready malts, raisins, tart black cherry, and caramel are all coming out. Taste: All of the aspects of the aroma are coming through as well as slight bitterness, earthiness, and Belgian yeast complimenting everything nicely. The finish is very complex tasting - can't quite put my finger on this new quality it introduces to the overall flavor and why it's so good. Mouthfeel - wow, I really like how this works - the beer coats and sticks to the mouth providing a pleasant tingling sensation, possibly due to the high alcohol content. Overall this is one of my favorite Belgian beers. It's odd that in my area it's not available at many places.... it belongs right next to the classics such as Delirium, Trappist beers, and so forth. Pick this up if you see it, as well as other De Dolle brews."
""
""
""
""
"Very easy to drink and enjoyable,"
"Overall, a very subtle and flovorful brew. Acohol heat does have some intensity, but seems to add rather than detract from the flavor."
"O: Good. Not wowed, but it's nice."
""
""
"2.5 finger thick off white head with nice lacing on a brownish orange murky body. Very nice lacing. Strong sweet dark fruit aroma, one of the best Belgian dark strong aromas I have experienced with cherry and raisin dominating. Flavor has more dark fruit with a sweet mild chocolate note. Medium body and moderate carbonation. Overall this is an excellent beer and excellent member of the genre. Very drinkable and complex."
"I’ll have another."
"Overall: Very nice beer. ABV of 9.5% is masked well. Will defiantly purchase again."
""
"Notes: Over the top in many ways, but very balanced. An intense brew that’s not for the faint of heart. For me, the carbonation is too high and the bitterness is a little rough. Otherwise, top notch."
""
"Tastes fantastic. The effervescence coats the mouth and the tart, sharp flavors linger for days. The malt gives it some sweetness to contrast with the sour notes. Warms well, with an apparent alcohol warmth to it at 9%. This is an excellent beer."
"Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Pours a very dark brown with red tones. Thin light tan head dissipates very quickly leaving a thin band around the glass, no lacing. Aroma of dark and light fruit, sour apples and cherries. Very dry dark and light fruit flavor. Complex flavor, but very subdued, finishes with a bit of alcohol and and a spicy, almost peppery hop bite. Medium bodied and surprisingly prickly carbonation considering the lack of a head. The dark body must block active carbonation that is not visible and clearly does not persist as foam. This is quite different; too dry for my taste, but I still enjoyed trying it. Interesting an unusual."
""
""
"Overall I would reccomend this beer to any fan of beer. Definetely worth $6 at Wholefoods. I now understand the reputation of DeDolles."
""
""
"Overall, it quite a neat take for the style, don't think I've had one this effervescent in feel, and the toned sweetness is nice. I think this one needs a food pairing though, don't feel drawn to just casually drinking it, but it's pretty solid have to admit."
""
"Overall, just terrific. A really nice melange of flavours in this one."
"Poured from an 11.2 oz bottle into an oversized wine-glass. Pours an opaque burgundy with a beautiful bubbly tan head that is two fingers even in this glass. It smells of yeast, cherries and a little like red wine- not a strong smell but very enjoyable and flavor enhancing. It tastes very strongly of sour cherries at first- very similar to Russian River's Consecration wild ale. The cherry persists throughout along with some malt and a hint of alcohol. Like all other De Dolle beers, Oerbier is very strongly carbonated (which personally I love) and not a beer you can drink really quickly. I highly recommend this beer."
""
""
"D: [DRINKABILITY] Extremely easy to drink - perhaps even too easy - but I don't really have the interest in ordering another. I guess I went in with expectations too high, because I wasn't that impressed. Maybe this beer prefers to be poured from the bottle."
""
""
"Overall: A solid BSDA but nothing special. I'm not sure I will seek this out again."
"although sweet, very delicious. a must try"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Very enjoyable and unique strong dark ale. Very interesting combination of flavors. I would definitely get this again."
""
"Medium bodied, creamy, with above average carbonation. Has a light sweet aftertaste, and the alcohol is well hidden. This is a very nice beer."
""
"There's a boozy burn, but it's not terribly noticeable. It's very possible that the spice flavors and lightly tingly carbonation worked in tandem to cover it up. Body is medium-full. The carbonation is prickly, but falls short of being overdone. It's an easy drinker given its complexity and alcohol content, but there's no rush."
"The flavors are deep, so deep and complex you can pick it apart the whole bottle. Deep Grape flavors of a low tannin Pinot are in abundance, some fresh baked fluffy wheat bread, a myriad of spices, clean red apples, pomegranite juices, and Tawny port for some sweetness and earthy notes. Fantastic."

"Edit: I let the beer warm up and ate some cheddar and pumpernickel and the beer started to get a bit better, warmer, less metallic. Added a couple points from the F."
""
"O: Excellent belgian ale. Glad I purchased it. Would buy again."

"Almost perfect nose. So beautiful."
"O - Excellent BSDA with ABV very well hidden. Even with that it is a sipper. I would highly recommend it."
"O - A top quality belgian with plenty of complexity and interest. Would probably age well. Too boozy to be anything but a sipper."
"(D)- A solid strong dark. A good balance and smooth flavors/feel despite the ABV."
"This is one of those beers I would call ""digestible."" It looks, smells, tastes, and feels wonderful. After finishing I am perfectly satisfied."
"Overall- My buddy had this in his bottle shop. He didn't know much about it, but took it in after reading the ratings. I'm glad he did. The little yellow round man wasn't going to let me leave without him. My bottle was a little young, but enjoyable nonetheless. I hear this one gets more and more tart as you age it, so I'll see what I'm in for in 6-12 months. Very, very good beer, but not quite Gouden Keizer Blauw level of awesomeness/Godliness."
"(O) Tastes more like a quad to me."
"O- A pretty nice beer. The slight metallic taste in the finish really holds this one down for me."
"Wonderful belgian strong dark ale."
"O: 8/10. very nice."
"It's a good bruin, no doubt about it. For the money, however, I'd probably stick with Gouden Carolus Classic-- they are remarkably similar. The label is kind of cute though, and it was by no means disappointing. Curious as to how this would taste minus the age."
"God, I love this beer."
"D: The dryness and booziness unexpectedly made this one a little bit of a sipper."
"O: This is a great beer -- not exceptional -- but great. I would love to buy it again except that it costs $6.99 for a 33cl bottle, too much in my opinion. If you love Belgian Dubbels or Belgian Strong Dark Ales, then you'll love this."
"O- Very different; not quite as dark as other BSDAs but not as sour or fruity as a flanders- yet I noticed some characteristics of such. I enjoyed this quite a lot and haven't had anything before similar to this..."
"Woooaaaah, each beer from De Dolle I try makes me respect and love them more. Great BSDA, get it if you spot it."
"Overall: Perfectly balanced brew where everything blends perfectly together"
" O - A nice example of a dark beer but somehow lacking that killer punch. Plenty of flavours to keep you interested but the carbonation here is probably a touch too strong and masks some of the more subtle elements."
"O: I'm missing the point why this would we one of the best BSDA's."
"O - Very enjoyable beer. Spent most of the time smelling the beer. Great beer! I had had this beer many years ago and didn't remember it being so amazing."
"Wow, is this a great beer. Now granted, this was my first exposure to Belgian beer, but it sure won’t be the last. It produced massive amounts of a tan head on the pour, even with a slow pour at a 45’ angle. Dark fruit to the nose and a rich nutty flavor that completly hides the 9% alcohol. This beer tasted great right from the refrigerator and as it warmed to cellar temperature. The alcohol warmth only came it as it neared room temperature. It did not strike me as all that tart, as many have noted. One of my favorite beers to date."
"Price = $9.99 at Whole Foods (NYC)"
"O- I'm fairly new to Belgian strong dark ales, so I don't have much of a reference point. Very enjoyable beer; I will be trying more of this style in the near future."
"The mouthfeel is thick and very creamy. Overall it was a pretty solid beer for the style. Lots of bold flavors to it, but they came together pretty nicely. It had some very nice range and depth to it as well. Very nice beer to sip on this evening."
"Pretty sweet, light tartness tucked in there to give it some depth and complexity. Cherries, wood, anise, caramel, toffee, molasses, dark bread, earth, light roast, candi sugar, bit of booze in the finish, round body with a bit of carbonation sparkle in the follow through. Flanders meets Belgian dark"
"Cheers!"
"D- after checking out the de dolle website i expected this one to be more tart, more wild, and fruitier. assertive hop flavor is well received on my end and i found the balance to be agreeable. nat en straf is doggone right."
"I think I'd like it alot more if the mouthfeel was improved, definitely not one of my favorite BSDA's but good overall."
"Highly recommend."
"O: Complex, delicious, rewarding, recommended. My second bottle, one I enjoyed as much as the first one, but it will likely be a long time before I have another. Too bad."
"Poured from the bottle into a tulip glass. Pours a dark brown red color with a nice, but gushing beige head which seems to be the norm for De Dolle beers. Aroma of roasted malts, hops, some esters (apples), caramels and spices. Flavors of roasted malts, caramels, apples, walnuts, liquorices, Belgian candy and spices. Good carbonation throughout and provides an interesting balance between sweet, bitter and sour palates along with a dry finish. This was an interesting and complex beer to drink. I believe this can age well."
"O - I'm gonna need to try this one fresh, I really feel like this should be a great beer."
"O- Amazingly complex and yet perfectly balanced. You'd just want more and more. If i must find a flaw with this beer i'd say that yeast has it feeling a bit heavy in the very last sips"
"O/D - I didn't really like this. I don't know if there was a problem with my bottle but this is a style I typically enjoy. I've rarely pick out those harsh notes in beers so I'd like to try another one but this isn't exactly easy to get in Canada. This just wasn't for me."
"Pours a very hazy brownish-red color that looks almost like a Flanders or something, except with a much larger tan head that diminishes rather slowly. Scent is a lot of dark fruit with some nice spiciness and Belgian yeast. Taste is quite pleasant. It's a Belgian, strong dark ale, but definitely not as sweet as most of them I've had (which is quite refreshing and different). This beer is full of dark fruit flavors without the sugar and Belgian yeast flavors. Hints of chocolate and a bit of lemon. Great taste. Mouthfeel is full bodied with a nice crisp finish. Nice carbonation. Drinkability is high. Overall, it is a highly drinkable Belgian strong dark ale with some lovely flavors and very well-balanced."
"O - a fine example of the style."
"Pretty damn tasty strong ale, dark and flavorful, served in a crucible-type goblet. Tasted somewhat like an unflavored lambic. Poured a bit cloudy mahogany. Aroma of dried dark fruits. Taste of dried dark fruits, roasty malts, and some dark sugar, molasses or toffee. Complex and tasty. Medium mouthfeel and a pleasure to drink."
"Drinkability and Overall Impression: I found this a bit less drinkable for my tastes than the other Belgian Strong Dark Ales I’ve tried. It is a fine beer, with a complex flavor profile but the tartness and mustiness that is part of it just doesn’t quite work for me. That said I’d definitely recommend that others sample it given a chance since it does have a lot of character and complexity. Overall my impression is that I’m pleased to have sampled this one since now I know its not quite right for me. It seems a well-made beer with interesting differences from other BDSA but I’ll seek out others in the future."
"(.33cl bottle) Pours a chocolate color with thick tan head. The carbonation is huge. I did pour the sediment rather than leaving the sediment in a separate glass. Incredible aroma of yeast and bread. Nice caramel flavor with chocolate tones and ripe bananas. Slight sourness at the end. Very complex beer that leaves you licking your lips. This is a great beer!"
"HV"
"O: they've an expert job of crafting a Belgian ale with just the right amount of sourness to counterbalance the sweet malt. It's really exceptional, I've never had anything like it. One of my all time favorites."
"Very complex brew. More subtle and delicate in flavor as the beer ages. I definitely prefer this beer more now than I did 2 years ago."
"M: zesty and tart up front, with a sweet, sticky malt mouthfeel leaving a lasting sticking flavor; medium/full body, very sticky and smooth"
"D: The over 9% ABV isn't masked all that well, but I allowed the brew to warm a bit and it settled out some, making Oerbier a pretty nice sipping Belgian dark ale."
"O: I found this to be extremely good, just a tick below incredible. I liked the added depth of tartness/apple cider vinegar, just done enough to add character without stealing the show from the dark fruits. The highlight is probably the extremely smooth and creamy texture."
"D: Like a cross between Chimay Grande Reserve and Liefmans Goudenband. I like it. Recommended."
"O: This is an intense beer in many aspects (alcohol, body, flavor). Considering this, it's still fairly drinkable. I do think that the toffee flavor is overdone, taking a toll on drinkability. I generally expect and prefer a dry Flanders Ale (and in general). Considering the price, I would go elsewhere (Liefmans?), but am certainly willing to try other beers from De Dolle and would gladly enjoy this beer if a friend would offer to share one with me =)."
"Overall: A very nice Belgian Dark Strong Ale. Good stuff."
"High carbonation and a thick mouthfeel. This is a sipper with a boozy high abv."
"Unfortunately, this was probably the second most powerful gusher I've had when opening a bottle (second only to the '09 Juliet). It sprayed like champagne, hit the walls, ceiling and cabinet. What a mess! I was only able to keep around 5oz of the bottle. It poured a dirty, murky raisin brown with a one finger toffee colored head. It smells of raisins, figs, plums, light toffee, and slight alcohol. This beer is very, very sweet. It tastes of very, very sweet raisins and dark malts. There is a boatload of dark fruits here. It drinks very smoothly and is between light and medium in body. It's just so cloyingly sweet that I'm almost glad I don't have the entire bottle to finish. It's certainly not the best Belgian Dark I've had."
"The body is medium and carbonation is high but appropriate. Overall this beer is very well crafted, but I think a couple years in the bottle would probably benefit it. The booziness isn't huge but it is a bit distracting. I will definitely revisit it in the future."
"on tap @ the Swift Hibernian Lounge - I had this on lunch break 2 days in a row - poured a deep hazy mahogany into a chimay goblet, where it puts up a 1 finger head - smells of the dark cherries, burnt sugary molasses a little alcohol and a bit of funk - taste works it's way through the mouth on many levels - the dark fruitiness up front yields to an almost vinegar - like sour and then to a roasty malt finish - prickly carbonation lightens up the otherwise heavy mouthfeel -alcohol taste is slight but the high abv is otherwise noticeable - pretty good stuff off the tap, but I'd be a fool to have another on a working lunch break."
"Not bad. Would like to taste their version of a Quad."
"I definitely prefer Stille Nacht by de Dolle, but after getting adjusted to the sweet candiness of it, I really like this beer."
"Notes: My favorite De Dolle brew by far and maybe my favorite Belgian beer. FFO Gouden Carolus Cuvee van de Keizer Blauw."
"D- Medium drinkability. Oerbier has a very bold flavor and aroma however the construction is simply straightforward. They are stacked in a straight line instead of being woven together like a tapestry. That being said the construction should not put the drinker off. The building blocks themselves are superbly delicious and would pair extremely well with a pungent sharp cheese or grilled beef/lamb!"
"O- This is a keeper. If it were a chick, she would have an amazing face, and great tits followed by a nice ass, with a freaky side that paid off. This beer is like a thick dubbel that had the wild funk deployed on it. It has characteristics that remind me of an abbey type brew and some wild ale/sour notes too. A beer to sit and contemplate on, especially if you brew... this is good."
"Overall pretty nice, good strong Belgian beer with nice flavors."
"D: Too high. This combines so many features of Belgian beers that it's a bit scary. Strong, dark, balanced, tart, yeasty--an exemplar of a varied style."
"Pours a dark reddish brown that is barely clear if you hold it up to a light. Lots of foam in the duvel tulip glass too. Tastes of caramal brown sugars with a slight dark fruit finish. Its very drinkable for the 9% alc, no hotness at all. Was hoping for a little more 'wow' with the flavour though. Still a good BSDA though."
"Overall impression: i love BDSAs and this was disappointing. it tastes more like a dubbel-flemish sour ale hybrid."
"D- great stuff. Every time I get the chance to enjoy a de dolle its always a treat but on draft is a whole other monster. Its like a familiar room on drugs, safe and warm but new and mind blowing at the same time. Its a special thing to get to see thing from another angle sometimes."
"One of the first things I am going to do next week is go out and get more."
"Bottled May 2010."
" M- The medium mouthfeel has a slightly slippery texture and a full finish with the soft carbonation and no alcohol heat noticed. There is a great flavor to this simplistically complex beer."
"Mouthfeel is very light and lively with lots of carbonated prickly feel on the tongue. Not quite what I'm used to compared to other BSDA's. Drinkability is moderate. Finely crafted overall."
"The final verdict is really that I need more Oerbier, and fresh next time. I'm completely unsure if I've hurt or hindered this bottle by putting it in time-out - quite possibly a bit of both. This was tasty and has loads of potential but didn't *quite* converge into Pure Deliciousness like I suspect it can. Recommended... but don't take my word for it."
"An excellent beer like nothing i've ever had, this is the base beer for flemish sours, but i like this better than any flemish sour i've had - way more subtle and complex...very wine-like. This is a very excellent brew...one of the nicest beers i've had in a while."
"glassware: tulip"
"Very good beer."
"T: Berries and spices on first glance. Dark fruits and good malty character. Finishes fruity and yeasty with berry and spiced dark fruits. Not so complex as the smell but still very well done."
"Beer is sweet and thin with lots of carbonation in the mouth. Its not boozy at all, its good, mildly spicy, good yeast character and breadiness overall. Its a good beer, not my favorite de dolle thus far but its solid."
"My local bottle shop finally started carrying De Dolle beers! Finally! Poured this one into a tulip. The pour is simply beautiful. This has a mahogany body with three fingers of smooth head that retains nicely and leaves behind sticky lacing. The aroma is tart apples, sugary candy, dark fruits and hints of alcohol. The taste is pretty malty with candied sugars, somewhat biscuity, and slight tart apples. The finish is rather dry. The mouthfeel is mostly dry and kind of hot, this one is a bit heavy. I'd love to grab another one of these and hold on to it a bit and see if the alcohol mellows out."
"Overall: This is my first beer from De Dolle and I really enjoyed it. Lots of great flavors and easily drinkable. I will definitely be trying more of their beers."
"D: The 9% is definitely there, but it goes down easily enough that I could have a second. A fantastic beer from a brewery I want to try more of."
"Drinkability -- A fine example of the style by a brewer that has far more hits than misses. The drinkability changes dramatically as it warms. While still chilled, the alcohol is sharp and off-putting, but really dissipates as the beer warms. Quite good, would have again."
"Pours a cloudy, nutty brown with a good sized tan head that died slow and left sticky lace on top of a nutty, yeasty smell along w/ some dark and sour fruit and sweet malt. Real smooth, creamy even, a dense medium body with a sweet edge of caramel and toffee, with some breadiness for malt balance and hints of roasted malt. This gives off a dry edge that works extremely well playing off the fruit flavors like orange, black cherry, some sour notes and even some citric hop bitterness on the backend - plus a touch of spice and pepper (clove?). The ABV is well-hidden and this is a quality sipper that is a must have."
"D-This beer's so Goddamn amazing. When I haven't had it for awhile I think maybe it won't live up to my memories of it, but it always does. It's a Belgian classic."
"Picked up this bottle a few weeks ago. Pours a ruby brown with an off why'd head and some crazy lacing. Head refuses to die down. Nose brings cherries, caramel, dark fruits, and slice. Taste really ramps up a dark cherry slash currant flavor with some dark drugs as well. A bit of spice as well. Feel is nice win prickly carbonation and some booze. Drinks quite well. Really tasty."
"Definitely a good beer, just a step below the La Trappe Double"
"It is a decent Belgian ale with decent complexity; i really do not enjoy the yeastiness from this beer or an De Dolle beers. I am not a fan of sour beers but I am curious about what happens to this one with some time."
"This is a very interesting beer. I'd consider it a must-try just because of how uniquely wine-like it is. I think it is a bit better than the score says."
"Good taste and a very enjoyable beer. This is my second beer from this brewery and a good one!"
"D: Goes down alright, milder kick than the ABV would indicate, a decent beer but I would go with others of the style."
"Drinkability: Excellent beer, another must try for the Belgian Quad/Strong Dark Ale enthusiast."
"D: smooth , could drink this all night long , ABV is very well bidden"
"All I can say is, WOW. It's not often that I gush like this over a beer, but this is truly an amazing brew. I can't think of a beer in this category that I've enjoyed more. It's a little pricey @ about $5 per 33cl bottle, but it isn't terribly difficult to find. If unavailable near you I would recommend trading for it. Well worth a little splurge. Deserving of its lofty rating."
"D- i wish they had put dates on their bottles. im guessing this is 2.5-3 years old. sadly, de dolle doesnt move that quickly around here. i guess people dont know what theyre missing. something to check out for all fans of this style or this brewery. i could probably handle a larger format bottle."
"D: Great nose on this beer but the alcohol presence knocks down the enjoyment of this one. Might be better with some age."
"Bottle. Poured into a tulip glass a hazy opaque reddish brown color with a big tan head of tiny bubbles. The aromas I get are of apples, spice, and alocohol, some wine type notes as well. The first thing I notice when drinking this beer is the carbonation. It hits your mouth and gives a little tart flavor followed by some bitterness and maltiness. Aftertaste is slightly bitter with alcohol. Light/Medium mouthfeel. A bit pricey at $6.29/bottle but glad I tried it."
"D: This was a decent dark Belgian ale with delicate and complex flavors, but it honestly wasn't very delicious. The body was too carbonated for me, which detracted from the delicate taste. The alcohol was also pretty noticeable, so I had to sip carefully. Not a bad brew, but not impressive either."
"OVERALL: A good, tasty beer, one of the better De Dolle offerings, but the palate is a little too airy and rough, making it hard to enjoy. It needs a little smoothening out, and leaving the beer sit in the glass for about half an hour seems to help. Still, one worth checking out."
"Drinkability- Great. Only bought one but could have very easily enjoyed several. Would work on a warm spring day or cold winter evening. Very good."
"D: At 9.5%, this beer is surprisingly very drinkable because the alcohol is well hidden, although it's better sipped to savor the complex taste."
"A very drinkable beer despite the disjointed sweet-to-malt-to-fruit taste and feel. The carbonation does this beer a great deal of justice by drying the beer and distracting from the sweet start and alcoholic finish."
"D - Another quality brew from De Dolle"
"Quite spritzy. The body is light and the carbonation is very high. The alcohol is far more notable in the taste--very warming in the swallow. While the aftertaste is short, it is similar to the feel of a fine port. The spice matches the aroma, offering some excellent complexity. Surprisingly, this is a dry taste--but still lots of malt."
"Not a very dark brew by Belgian standards, sort of a dark amber or Auburn. Minimal head and lacing but still a solid looking brew. Aroma has lots of honey, rum and bourbon, one of the sweeter dark Belgians I have had. Lots of malt in the taste, bourbon and toffee. It's light on the color and on the tongue, but very rich in the taste. Complex brew here and one of the most unique Belgian darks I have had as my tastes tend toward the lighter Belgian brews. A must try."
"Pours a muddy tawny color with a booming tan colored head that I have a hard time controlling and eventually end up with half the glass being foam. The foam eventually settles down to a nice layer atop the glass and remains as its drank. Aroma is sour fruit, some sort of berry, a little bit of fig and alcohol. Flavor is apple, berry, raisin with some bitterness and an alcoholic finish. Its full-medium bodied and has a prickly amount of carbonation. I really enjoyed the aroma and the flavor even though it did end up being fairly alcohol forward. Certainly a unique beer and ended up being much different than I expected but overall I really enjoyed the experience."
"Great Belgian beer. I love that it's more tart than the other De Dolle ales."
"Pour is rusty brown, heavily carbonated. Smell is a malt bomb of atomic proportions, taste is the same. Taste and smell of brown bread, brown sugar, honey, sweet molasses (not blackstrap), and dark fruits (figs, dates, prunes, and raisins). Some caramel, toffee, cinnamon, and cloves in there also. Big beer with lots of malts, nothing worth trying again."
"Notes: ABV = 9%. Nice BSDA that has a bit more tart and vinous flavors than other similar beers. Very well spiced, put the vinous/tart flavors cut that a bit. Full of raisin and grape like flavors. Good, solid beer to drink from a good brewery. Nice for a slightly different beer if you want a BSDA. Definitely worth a try."
"Drinkability: Among the most interesting BSDAs out there, the tart elements add a lot to the character of this beer"
"D- a very rich and tasty beer. Well done yet I have to say this is the perfect serving for a beer that is this big."
"D: A solid BSDA I'd be happy to drink again."
"Oerbier is a unique ale, and one of the best examples of the style; however, it also seems to have quite a bit of batch variation lending to the impression that the contents of the bottle are very much alive."
"Bottle, home. De Dolle is an excellent brewery and this is another excellent De Dolle beer. Oerbier pours a bright, brilliant shade of ruby with an enormous, foamy head. The head is fantastic. The beer has a sweet caramel malt fruitiness aroma. There are grapes, apricots, and cherries on top of caramel and earth. It has a sweet and sour bite in the flavor. There's a very mild soy sauce flavor in the finish, but it doesn't detract. Mouthfeel is very lively, which, while a fun change, makes drinking almost difficult. This beer picks up with some time in the glass, so sip it slowly and enjoy."
"D – Off the hook."
"D: Alcohol presence is nowhere to be found and other than some initial carbonation issues, it goes down very easily."
"D: Very good. Tasty treat."
"First time I tried this, and I would seriously recommend you try it too. Topstuff from Belgium."
"D- Goes down smooth, but the alcohol really sneaks up on you with this one..."
"Drinkability: highly drinkable for such a strong ale. The flavor is good but not huge, which means drinking a lot of this would not be overwhelming."
"O: Great drinkability despite the 9.5%. Excellent beer. Just another de Dolle masterpiece"
"Brouwerij De Dolle Brouwers produces truly great beer (Dulle Teve and Extra Export Stout) and good beer (Ara Bier, Bos Keun and Stille Nacht). Oerbier proudly takes its place in the first group and is a BSDA that fans of the style should not miss. Highly recommended."
"The fruit is also present and a nice way, making this beverage difficult to categorize. Beer complex."
"M/D: dryness was a negative, but not overwhelming. Very easy to drink, with no discernable alcohol flavor at all. very enjoyable."
"A great Belgian dark strong ale. I loved the cherry tartness in this beer and the oak flavors, melds very well and highlights the traditional dark fruit and caramel components. Very unique for this style, i very much enjoyed it."
"Overall, too alcoholic and overly carbonated to be given top-scores. (330 ml, bottled Oct 2010, BB Oct 2012, into tulip)"
"D: A nice BSDA, the flavour is real good, has that De Dolle spicy yeast house character. Happy to try another one from these guys."
"D: A superb Belgian ale with great representations if malt, yeast, and hops complexity. I am not a fan of sour beers but I am curious about what happens to this one with some time."
"Poured into a Duvel glass. Huge gusher, which I had prepared for given the fact that the other two De Dolle beers I've had have been gushers. The mere yeast turbulence/pressure fluctuation from opening and pouring the beer filled not only the glass but the bottle with ever-rising foam. The beer is a deep, almost-purple brown with a ludicrous topography of beige suds that leaves lace chunks everywhere. The aroma is caramely at its base with accents of souring fruit, cocoa powder, cola, sherry, and a coppery metallic note. Flavor is sweet and spicy with a solid warming alcohol presence. Cinnamon, citrus, slight acidity, toffee, dark bread. Full-bodied with (obviously) too much carbonation, but with a little time it gains drinkability. A nice rich sipper."
" Dissapointment is the only word I can think of right now."
"If I had drank this beer quickly (which believe me--would not have been difficult) I probably would have been able to give it a much higher score. As it continued to warm however, the spices became just a little overwhelming."
"D. Very drinkable, Probably too drinkable at 9% abv. A new fav! Thanks Mike!"
"An interesting take on the style that surely is delicious. Probably not my favorite for the style but it's quite drinkable fresh and with some aging, may become even more impressive."
"Drinkability: The chocolate malt/dark fruit taste is very good. The sour is extremely sour. A good beer I will get again, but one per sitting."
"Notes - A buddy and I bought this one on a whim, partly due to the cartoonish, indistinguishable label complete with no mention of the brewery and a picture of a yellow marshmallow man holding an electric mixer beater and wearing a homecoming sash. A new favorite."
"Complex and may or may not be good with food. One might want to experiement with this one."
"Review from notes taken on: 10/20/09."
"This review is for a fresh bottle but some of the vintage bottles I have had have been even better. This ages with the best of them. God forbid that you get your hands on a bottle of this with the old yeast that De Dolle used back in the 1990's. I had a very old bottle in Belgium with the old yeast that could have ruined all further beers for me. It was that good."
"Another beer that foams too much for me which spoils any hope of a good visual appearance. Belgian beers that do this the minute I open the bottle don't interest me. I am drinking a beer not Champagne. What beer I got in the glass formed a huge foamy head that left latticed lace as it slowly subsided. It was an very dark amber color with very little light getting through. An aroma of malt and spices. The flavor was of malt, chocolate and cherries. The body was medium light and the finish rather sweet."
"D- Definitely goes down smooth for the style. Not the best but it isn't really a sipper. At 9% I didn't expect an especially strong hard to drink beer. I like the percentage for the style, sometimes 11ish % can be a little much."
"Pours a deep brown orange color with a small fizzy brownish head that lasts and lasts. Super sweet nose, cherry, red licorice, green apple tartness, rum, raison very layered, very complex. Coating, port like and semi tart on the back end. Tongue foaming carbonation prohibits a large quaff. Rich, sweet and very pleasant, nothing off here. A drying wave of alcohol swoons in late on the sip cleaning up the experience. An incredible beer when fresher, as with most De Dolle beers this one evolves into something special with some age as well."
"On the whole, this is a nice, flavorful and drinkable beer. Though it is a bit of a sipper, its potency conjoined with overall pleasantness make it a bit dangerous."
"M &D - Light to Medium bodied and quite effervescent. Soft on the tongue and very easy to drink. I know the alcohol is there but it did not affect the drinkability at all. Could drink this all night."
"Beer poured into my Kapittel Watou chalice. Beer is a gorgeous burnt orange color, with a pillowy head that won't quit. Carbonation is ferocious in this bad boy. Smell is rather muted with yeast, fruits, and some fig. Taste is more akin to a tripel from my taste. Alcohol punishes this beer in a bad way. Light on the palate but a bit astringent, not sure if I got a bad bottle or what but this definitely wasn't what I was hoping for."
"The good brunes (like this one) are more comparable to fine brandys that beer."
"D - Less drinkable than some of De Dolle's other offerings, but still no slouch in this category."
"BUT...BUT...here's the rub: I'm kind of sick of De Dolle beers always gushing on me. I've had more 12 oz. De Dolle bottles explode all over the place more often than not. I know how to serve beer, the best temp to store and serve them at, etc., and I do all that. And I don't shake the things up before opening. So, as much as I absolutely love this brewery and its beers, I avoid them half the time because of the hassle and potential unpleasantness of the experience. Proceed with caution, but if it DOES gush on you, don't say I didn't warn you (as if anyone's read this far). Whatever occurs, what you do have left in your glass of choice is still going to be some of the finest nectar on the planet."
"Cheers."
"Figs and plums, lots of raisins, mustiness. A vinous characteristic makes it even stranger, and although pleasant, it is weird before it is tasty; not very well integrated. Perhaps it is too hot today."
"D - Each taste is a party. Nice one!"
"Very very good beer in my opinion, i wish i had bought several of these instead of just the one."
"Had this one last night as part of a De Dolle session. Poured a burgundy color with thick, slightly offwhite head that faded slowly and left good, solid lacing. Smelled of fruits, yeast, cinnamon, spices, and alcohol. Tasted of dark fruits, sugar, yeast, and roasted malt. Smooth, but slightly fizzy and dry. Could have another"
"Prickly carbonation and heavy rum-like alcohol flavors make this beer a good candidate for aging. Raisins, figs, tobacco and wood flavors intermingle and make it taste almost as if it was stored in rum barrels. The beer does nothing to hide the decently high ABV, it even seems to flaunt it a bit. Its a very complex beer and as it warms, more of the malty sweetness comes out. Adding the yeast from the bottle is a nice treat and adds a cinnamon roll doughiness to the brew. This is an excellent beer and I wish I had more to lay down for a few years. A sipper for sure, the drinkability is only hindered by the high ABV. Went well with some white cheddar."
"D- The alcohol presence is noteable, but the beer becomes fruitier and more drinkable as it warms."
"It tastes sweet, hints of chocolate and wood. Not a great beer, but ok."
"A rare treat for me, easily in the top 5 belgians I have had all time. The finish is a little more peppery/dry than I would like for drinkability, but I'm just nitpicking. Maybe I'll get another and see how a few years treats it. Go to all lengths possible to get yourself one of these beers."
"Drinkability is high, considering the abv and the style. This is due to the balanced taste, the comparatively light body and the hidden alcohol."
"D: Not bad for the style, though probably wouldn't want more than one at a time."
"Very drinkable, but remember the 9% alcohol content before you go crazy on it."
"A nice enough Belgian; plenty of pleasant characters to it. The 9% is hidden very well. It really doesn't have a huge profile, but it is quite drinkable."
"A very nice beer."
"Overall this is a very good beer and I've become an official fan of De Dolle. Definitely worth a shot."
"D: This is a very drinkable beer. The alcohol is masked very well and it is complex without being overdone."
"Spot on carbonation, great amount of alcoholic heat on the palate."
"Pretty good as a Flanders Old Bruin, but certainly far from any other Belgian Strong Dark Ale I've ever had. A bit too dry and astringent for my liking. Points for this being like nothing I have ever tried before."
"This is definitely not an beer you're going to want to drink every day, but it is certainly a vision into what can be done when you fuse two seemingly disparate brewing traditions."
"This is a very fine beer without the alcohol or yeast flavours that could be dominant in this style."
"4 D: a lovely-balanced beer this is, and certainly worth revisiting time and again."
"Heavier mouthfeel that other ones from De Dolle, very easy to drink despite the abv, a great beer to have around."
"A great Belgian beer, almost in the same league as Stuise's Pannepot."
"11.2oz. bottle served in my New Belgium Globe glass. Poured with a dense, three inch, tan-colored head. Excellent retention with thick clouds of lacing revealed as the brew slowly recedes into a solid quarter inch cap. Nose is vinous upfront, but I also pick up cherries, a tart quality and cocoa in the mix. Taste is consistent with nose - the dark fruit and cocoa really come together nicely. A slightly metallic quality comes out, as well as some acidity towards the back. Mouthfeel is just short of medium-bodied, with a subtle background carbonation. I love De Dolle brews, and Oerbier is definitely at the top of the list. A great beer from a great brewer."
"A interesting brew from one of my favourite belgian breweries. Should be interesting to try the 2006 vintage i have sitting in my pantry in a few years."
"D: A fantastic beer with great complexity. I really like the vinous character of this one. The only thing stopping it from getting top grade in taste is the slightly too prominent taste of alcohol in the finish."
"Mouthfeel is very crisp and dry, medium bodied, crisp carbonation. Beautiful beer."
"Oerbier is a rare, exceptional hand crafted product, and in my humble opinion, one of the best Belgians available in America. If I find these, I buy the entire inventory as one never knows when you'll find them again -- why risk it?"
"All said, I was hoping for more from this beer. Far too much emphasis on the dark fruit and alcohol, I wished for more balance. I sipped my way through this one, but when it was over I'd had enough."
"Pours a reddish brown colored body, maybe cloudy, with a small tannish head, not as lasting. Has an aroma of dark fruit, raisins, dark fruit. Sickly sweet. Dark fruit taste. Carbonated, sweet. Vinegary. Good taste, not too complex."
"Amazing stuff."
"At first the subtlties seem like a weakness but I should know better by now. It was slightly chilled when I opened it but, as it warms, those subtle flavors expose themselves and really make it an enjoyable experience."
"I really really like this brew. I had one in Belgium from the Delirium Cafe and it was amazing. I had one from City Beer in SF and it was more sour and still great but not exactly what I expected. My ratings are based on the Oerbier bottle I had in Belgium. This is a highly carbonated beer in Beligum but was way too carbonated when I had it in the US. The taste was sweet and very drinkable. The after taste was right on. This is a beer to wright home about. I would recommend that you try this beer as close to the brewery that it is made."
"ugh... what can i say? i'm done with de dolle! if you do something about your gushers, maybe i'll give another try. but when will that be!?"
"Overall: Interesting Belgian strong dark ale but I've had others that I liked more. Maybe I would like a fresh one better."
"Overall interesting brew."
"This is a standout beer."
"Drinkability: This is a well developed and complex Belgian. The strong flavor of cherries would lead me to believe that there are definitely cherries added here, but I know better. I have avoided some of these beers because the lack of description on the label sometimes leaves me wondering what is what. Glad I got over that."
"D - It is a wonderfully complex brew that is just too drinkable."
"De Dolle is on my list of breweries to visit while in Belgium if i ever get there."
"D= This is a world class beer deserved of immense respect. The malts are just right and the yeast is incredible. Despite the abv and huge flavors, this remains a very drinable ale as well. Highly recommended."
"Pours a dark reddish- brown color with a nice sized foamy, off-white head. Fruity aroma with hints of sour cherry, oak and apple. Tart, slightly puckering fruit flavor with crisp light fruit notes and a very dry finish. Taste a little bit like a Sweettart."
"the drinkability is very good, in the context of beefy 9% abv belgian beers. it's a great example of it's style."
"In the end I was really happy with this selection. Very rich and lively with a palate that was well balanced between the dark fruit and the delicous sweet malts. Very complex and very, very drinkable. I cannot wait for the reserve up next!"
"Bottle from Sams in Chicago. Pours out an amazing thick cream colored head, I mean this gave me a pour with 90% head. The body is a fizzy light brown. The aroma is full of sweet candies and rich fruits. The taste was full of fruits; sour cherries, strawberries, also a massive chocolate and yeast balance. The body is fizzy and full. Some metallic and near bitter notes in the finish. Very well balanced, and so damn good. One of my favorite BSAs for sure. Just lovely."
"pour is a maple syrup amber with flakes that settle. head is medium body with a white tint of that tone. is toffee, candied orange, and coriander and a cantaloupe sweet quality. the taste has hints of that but a harsher palate. has if the orange peel scent comes from unripened oranges. toffee is a bit smokey. some bread not much. hoppier style like most of the de dolle beers. not as peppery but present more so that the typical of the style. the aftertaste has a floral quality that blend with the malt much like a good dubbel. but a tad more on the burnt herbal. good beer. above average as an effort. but a good taste. complex but harsher than most."
"Pretty good stuff, however I don't think I'll be getting it again."
"D: Interesting beer, I have all kinds of respect for this beer, it looks and tastes amazing though a bit too bubbly in my opinion, has some wine like characteristics in points and its tough for me to know how to rate as its not the easiest beer to drink. Taste is amazing look is amazing but its it must be taken as is when considering the drinkability factor. One of these is plently, at least as it stands now."
"A ""big"" beer in a little bottle. Interesting complexities with an interesting bite. Well-done, but a bit too much for me to handle. A slow sipper to be sure. Wouldn't get it again, though, especially not for the 5 bucks and change."
"D- This is a great beer. I have had the Reserva though so this pales in comparison to that. I miss the sour/funk of the Reserva. Great brew overall though. I just hope the carbonation works itself out a bit."
"D: A good Belgian but a tad heavy on the fusels.The beer is sour, with a vinous palate and vinegar like flavor in the aftertaste and I could not imagine trying to drink more then one at a time."
"et candyis oranges tart fruity sweetnes rather than breads, tart cherries, big carbonates lightness on the mouth"
"Overall and excellent example of BSDA , or a Quad."
"Pours a nice dark amber/brown with a slight reddish hue and a huge beige head that stuck around for quite a while. Nice lacing. Aromas are huge: sour cherries and grapes and a bit of funky yeast dominate, with a bit of light, sweet caramel in the background. Sharp, tart flavors on initial tasting. Quite acidic. Eventually the fruit flavors come out again, along with a bit of lightly toasty malt and a lot of peppery spice. Slightly metallic, warming finish. Lots of carbonation. Another great brew from De Dolle."
"D- A very drinkable beer especially with the strong ABV. I think if I drank this style more I would get used to the carbonation and tartness. If my taste were to change away from Imperial IPAs and more toward tart beers I could see where this would be a very drinkable beer."
"Despite the carbonation, this is still quite enjoyable. Another great beer from De Dolle."
"Pours a murky dark brownish amber with a large lasting bubbly white head. Strong and very sweet aroma of yeast, sugar and caramel malt. The taste is quite sweet as well with a load of candied sugar and enough sourness to make your tongue tingle. Lots of caramel malt along with fruit, yeast and pretty strong alcohol presence. Medium bodied with strong carbonation and a sugary sweet, almost syrupy mouthfeel. I actually prefer this slightly to the Reserve, very nice."
"Pours brown in color with a ginormous head. Took a long time to pour because I had to wait for the head to die down far enough to pour the rest in. Smell is dark fruits and some tartness. Taste is much the same with a nice yeasty flavor as well. Creamy and wonderful on the mouthfeel. I can only imagine what the Reserve tastes like. Have yet to have a disappointing beer from De Dolle."
"bottle from city wide in south bend. Pours brown with a red hue. Foams up massively and tqakes a while to settle to a quarter inch light brown head. Smells of oak, dried cherries, figs, smeels quite tasty...nots of dark chocolate, run, raspberry syrup. Taste is tinny, with malt and alcohol. Metallic flavor quite pronounced and not particularly welcome. Tannin bitterness. Chalk. As it warms, the metal flavors reduce somewhat (though not totally) and it gets more fruity. Fairly full bodied and approaching creamy. Not sure how i feel about this overall. Its interesting and complex, but has some distinctly unpalatable flavors like tin or stell that turn me off. So i suppose overall im ambivalent"
"Finish is tart and metallic."
"D: Very drinkable for its strength."
"I'm not getting much nose on the beer, just a few spices. The alcohol comes out quite a bit in this beer but there are spices, and a bit of something sweet. The beer doesn't have load of flavour but the flavour that comes through is pretty good. It's very very balanced. Very nice mouthfeel, a bit better than most. The beer is quite drinkable for a Belgian beer too!"
"Tastes rather fruity (kind of sweet and sour), malts, grassy hops and a bit of spice. Another great beer from De Dolle."
"Nice brown color with some amber shades. A frothy tan head. Lots of fruit with spicy Belgian hops and yeast. The taste is similar lots of Belgian pepper with some nicely balanced malts. Faint hops as well. A silky body that leads to very nice drinkability. A very well balanced beer that is not as complex as some other examples of the style."
"11.2 oz bottle, ordered in a shipment of many of its friends & cousins. The strange mascot, looking like a cross between the ""Jeep"" from Popeye and the Stay-Puff marshmellow man from Ghostbusters makes the bottle look cheesy and creepy at the same time. I do like the bowtie wrapper above the label, though. I feel the beer has dressed to impress. It pours a ruddy brown with a very thick, active, rocky tan head that oh so slowly works its way down. Daddy like. The smell is oranges, cinnamon, leather, raisins, and a surprisingly light flowery note. Holy guacamole. Good God. The taste doesn't dissapoint. It starts fruity and almost sweet, quickly fading to a chalky spice, nutmeg and cloves. A surprising coffee roast makes a brief appearance before plums and raisins come finish the day, but as sweet as you expect those flavors to be, they are dry and crisp. I REALLY have to stretch to find any room for improvement here. A touch sweeter and it would be heaven. OK, heaven plus, with it being merely heavn as it is. The mouthfeel is chewy, slick, and feather soft. The drinkability is beyond reproach. This one masks the alcohol really well, leaving you foolishly thinking you can make a session of our new-found friend, JeepPuff. This is why I need to move to Belgium. If you find this beer, hoard it."
"Very nice. This brewery does good work."
"Drinkability. Despite a few references to 'light', this is far from a session beer. Definitely worth a try. More than one? Depends what else is on the menu."
"Pours dark brown with a thick tan head. Aroma of plums, raisins, caramel, toffee, and alcohol. Excellent flavor of dark fruits, brown sugar, and carlamel with string vineous notes. Dry and sweet on the finish. Throughout the beer, the vineous quality shines through, but doeasn't dominate the beer. Very nice Belgian."
"Aside from the excessive carbonation, this beer was outstanding. Smooth, rich, complex and easy drinking, this is an exceptional example of the style."
"This was an odd beer. My experience with De dolle up to now is limited and = painfully carbonic/fizzy (still nacht). I was expecting the same here, but the fact that this bottle is either mistreated or just old, really changes the perception and overall flavor profile. It's not particularly complex at this point, and I gather a fresh bottle yields a completely different experience. That being said, this particular bottle I had wasn't bad, and will compel me to find another bottle to try once again. At this point, it's a sipper to be sure."
"Poured a wonderful cloudy reddish dark brown. Plenty of champaign like bubbles. Smells slightly of sour apples and plenty of yeast. Tastes of overly bubbly sour apples, earthy yeast and bread. Very dry finish. Tasty beverage high abv that cant be tasted."
"Finally! I get some back up from the beer savant below me. I too do not think much of this beer. More on that later. Dark murky copper brown with a seriously over-carbonated head. Aroma of yeast, spice and candy sugar. The flavor is so hard to taste with all these hairy bubbles going ape shit in my mouth. As the flavor emerges I sense overt yeasty spiciness, an acidic tartness, and definite alcohol presence. Body is hard to discern as well with all these bubbles. Finishes alcoholic and yeasty. I have had most of the De Dolle beers before (different bottlings, different ages) and this is a consistent experience: too much carbonation, overtly alcoholic and unbalanced and hard to swallow - it's almost like home brew gone really bad. If this stuff is so heavily coveted then we should all just go back to Stroh's."
"Appears with huge overly carbonated fine bubbles it takes a good fifteen to 30 minutes to poor this beer into my chalice at the end of that time the head dwindles and leaves fine lace to the sides of my glass. I experienced the same phenomenon with Stille de Nacht body appears a murky unfiltered deep ruby brown tea like tone with a large fine bubbled head. Aroma sharp sweetness with a pungent note of fruit tartness mild metallic noted and pure carbonation tickling the nose. Flavor is overtly alcoholic with a bland bitter dirty fruit and malt combo, heavy on tobacco leaf and earthiness very unbalanced with stale tasting hop notes, mild tart apple and acidic qualities added in. I don't wanna say infected but with carbonation like that and completely uncohesive flavors I'm floored. Mouthfeel is highly carbonated tickles the throat and dampers drinkability medium bodied overall. Drinkability is poor I'm looking for fine velvet like drinking ales from Belgium and this one is a train wreck of spice tartness and malt flavors."
"11.2 oz bottle purchased from Wine and Beverage Depot in Totowa for $3.99... the appearance - where do I start? I can hardly see the beer underneath a gigantic foany and frothy cream-colored head that obliterated my glass... dark-brown caramel-colored hue underneath the immense top... strong aroma of cider, sugars, and alcohol noticeable... Red bottle logo specifically states ""9% alc./vol.""... The taste also complements the hefty ABV with a noticeable alcohol presence underneath flavors of figs, prunes, malts, caramel, vanilla, and raisins... not my favorite beer from De Dolle, but a worthy sample nonetheless... good, creamy and rich mouthfeel, but drinkability took a hit due to the noticeable alcohol both in the flavor and taste... Also present is an undeniable essence of syrup, mollasses, and a medicinal-characteristic in the flavor... different... worth a try... As a side note, for a Belgian Strong Dark Ale, this is a rather bitter depiction of the style with an apparent toffee flavor included..."
"D: Its a tad too sweet for much more than a one and out experience. However, it is a massive DSDA that deserves a special place in my stash."
"The taste is unbelievably smooth but complex. The sour that I mentioned is there but only for a bit. Then you get the hops followed by the chocolate and malt. The alcohol is almost not present and well hidden. Also some notes of nutmeg and spices. I can't believe how complex this is. A long finishing beer that needs to be sipped and enjoyed. Just amazing and as close to perfection as it gets for me. It keeps on changing as it warms. Relax and enjoy."
"Pours a hazy brown with a tan head that quickly fades. At first this beer just seems like a mixture of pale or pilsner malt with Belgian dark candi, but it becomes more complex as I drink on. The aroma is very sweet and bready, but with earthy spices. The main flavor is a big sweet caramel that quickly turns dry. Around the edges there are hints of cocoa, dates, and vanilla. Those little flavors are what set this beer apart from other dark Belgian as they're obvious enough to enjoy, you don't have to really dig deep to find them. The beer finishes dry and a touch tart and all in all made a nice pairing for beef and then chocolate cake."
"i know it's a turn off to some, but whenever i open a de dolle brew, i'm astounded at how alive these things seem to be. i've never been able to pour a whole 33cl bottle into a glass at once. deep, dark, muddy, murky, reddish brown with a tan head that doesn't hold as well or leave as much lace as would be expected, this is still a great looking beer, floaties and all. smell is really nice. citrus, caramel, roast, cherry, dried fruit, and on and on. taste is a fairly complex blend of everything the nose suggests with cherry notes in the finish that seem to dominate the whole thing for me. i love the effervescence of belgian beer (i guess that's the word) and the way a good one really seems to dance with no abandon once it gets in you. this one is no exception, but i know that peculiar prickliness is very unappealing to some, so i took a few points off the mouthfeel. as far as drinkability, i'd imagine any beer w/9+%abv has a pretty low overall sessionability, but this one is pretty damn drinkable to me. bring 'em on de dolle."
"Gushed out of the bottle upon opening. After that, its got a pale tan head with fine bubbles that leave some spotty lacing. The head stays fairly thick and fluffy for quite a while. The beer itself is somewhat transluscent reddish brown. Nice aroma of cellared apples along with some light spice, and a touch of brown sugar. Taste is slightly sour to start and has elements of raisins, quince, cardomom, cream, and perhaps some sour cherries. Pretty nice. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy. Extremely easy to drink, this just slides down. The fruitiness makes this especially tasty and there is no way you'd think the abv is 9.5. Dangerously drinkable."
"Pours with a huge light tan head that just stays and stays. The beer itself is an opaque dark brown. Smell is sweet with tangy fruit notes. Carbonation is good and the mouthfeel is perhaps just a little thin. Very good drinking beer with very subtle complexities, a nice Belgian strong dark."
"Bottled obtained at a shop in Brugge. Poured a deep brown color and the bottle was so happy to be opened it ran over the top a bit. Poured into my tulip glass there was a 2 inch thick tan head. The nose was nicely malty and had a touch of citrus. The taste was full of malt but had a good balance with some citrus, fruity and yeast notes that overall make for a full beer but very drinkable."
"Pours a very dark, bordering on opaque, brown that has a ruby tint to it when held to light. Darker tan head that rises high, but falls fast. Nose is of very dark sugars that have been heavily roasted. Flavor has a slight roasted coffee edge. The most prominent taste is the thick malty sugar. It borders on being a bit too much though. Feel is thick and slightly syrupy with minimal carbonation"
"I have loved this beer everytime I've had it.... I've finally starting reviewing beers for BA, and now I really want to cellar a few. I bet it really dries out and becomes hugely complex."
"the flavor rich and malty but not over the top, there is an acidic twang that balances the sweetness, little citrus, and finishes with a lingering spice."
"Pours a cloudy brown/red, very opaque, medium brown head forms, leaves some lace spots, settles to a thin layer, pretty neat looking. Smell is great, chocolate covered raisins, cherries, light sourness, toffee, bit of funk, very rich. Taste is figs and toffee, chocolate, raisins, sour cherry chocolate, bit buttery, very rich, chocolate aftertaste lingers. Mouthfeel is medium to light bodied with medium to high carbonation, pretty awesome flavours, very unique. Thanks Chris!"
"Review added 11-9-2007, translated from french 3-2-2008."
"D, notes: Very good. Not my favorite style but this one is well made and hides its alcohol well. Rich and complex."
"This is a totally fantastic beer, don't know how many I could drink in a session due to the high ABV, but this a beer I hope to revist soon"
"This is a great beer. Picture the best double you've had mixed with a little bit of samuel smith fruitiness. A ton of flavor and all very well balanced. I could drink it all day."
"Carbonation is extremely high and this just accentuates the dryness in the beer. Very unique beer. I like."
"After having a fresh one and this vintage bottle side by side, i'm feeling pretty good. Definitely one to sip and contemplate. Can't say that this vintage is ""better"" than the latest incarnation, but it has aged very well. Interesting to say the least, it's exemplary of what cellaring can achieve."
"I found just one bottle of this sitting in the Hop Shop in Indianapolis. I haven't seen it before so I picked it up. Glad I did. I would certainly love to have this again."
"This is a fantastic beer, but rich enough that youre not going to drink it with any speed, nor should you. Savor and enjoy!"
"Drinkability- Still seems out of style to me. It was good though, whatever it falls under. Was overpriced though at $7.99 for a 2 year old bottle. I'd pick one up though if you see one at a price of $5 or under to try. Especially if you like Flanders syle brews."
"Drinkability: Very good beer. Very good example of the style that I enjoy more than some of the higher rated beers. The beer improves as the drink goes on and add character as you drink. Definitely worth searching out."
"Smooth mouthfeel. Very drinkable and refreshing."
"Drinks like a session. Dangerous. Smoother than the Grotten Brown, but with much richer flavor."
"Another solid brew from De Dolle. Very unique and interesting. I can't recall too many BSDAs using candi sugar but maybe I wasn't paying close enough attention."
"drinkability is good. the alcohol is mostly noticeable by the warmth on the way down, but it's still enjoyable. definitely enjoying this one, and i'd love to let one age for a while and see how it changes."
"de dolle kicks ass. nuff said."
"Great drinkability, I think I need a case of this. One of the best brews of this style that I've tried in a while."
"There's some of that good spice in the taste, but then the sour grape flavor comes into play. It's too much. I really can't drink it. Actually, i drank about half a glass because it was so bizzarre. It tastes more like low quality wine than beer. Or perhaps a combination of the 2."
"Into a tulip glass, pours a sickly kind of russet brown meets auburn, lots of floaties about, ugly gray ones too, but a good sizable off-white bubbly head that shrinks to a thickish film, little lacing. Aroma and taste are very similar, very nice, with all kinds of dark fruits like plums, pears, apples, raisins or apricots or somehting of that sort, a light bit of alcohol, tons of spices all over the place. The mouth is fullish, good carbonation, alcohol warming is nice, really its just a yummy beer, and while expensive, its a must have once in a while."
"D- excellent. not too tart. vinous, like a wine. alcohol present, but not overwhelming. would be nice to age."
"I bought this bottle at Ray's Liquor in Wauwatosa."
"it is not hot, but warming. bitter, but not in any lingering way. the mouthfeel is medium and lightened by carbonation"
"Served in a snifter, it pours dark brown with some ruby red tints with about an inch tan head. It smells mostly like dark fruit and brown sugar. It tastes like raisins, plums, cherries and some caramel. There's also a mild tart finish, but the tartness doesn't last for too long. Mouthfeel is medium but there's too much carbonation in this beer for me, but luckily it's not quite enough to ruin it. Drinkability is good, but it would be better if there was less carbonation. Not a bad beer at all, but it's not something I could drink all the time."
"D: Drinkability is good for something packing 9.5% abv. The alcohol is very well hidden beneath the tangy, sweet, and tart flavors going on here. You will feel your cheeks getting rosey as you finish this one."
"Yeah, pretty run-of-the-mill. Definately not worth the price. Not at all."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability; the mouthfeel on this one is full bodied, and very creamy, with a bit of bite from the carbonation. Drinkability is really good , but the alcohol bite, and content make this one a sipper for sure."
"33cL bottle from Burby and Bates in Orono. Dark brown nearly opaque body with a couple of inches of persistant light tan head. Citrus sweetness with a hint of hop bitterness characterize the aroma. Fruitiness and roastiness dominate the flavor with some hop bitterness on the finish, unusual for a Belgian. On the heavier side of medium bodied. Not bad, but not sure it's something I'd get again. Worth the try though."
"I don't think I enjoy this particular flavor profile as much as the other De Dolle products I've tried, but that shouldn't stop me from developing a taste for it."
"Beer fell into my 16 oz glass with a very pretty foamy head. Everything about this beer was wild to me. I would like to try some of their other beers. I think it is a quality product and that the company will do well. I think beer advocates will like it. The smell and taste was very complexe and hard to explain. Yeasty and fruity to me. Right stiff % wise I would say. I would drink one again if offered but most likely will not purchase one again."
"The taste is far more tart and vinous than the nose would suggest. Big flavors...I just wish it was a little less sour. Oh well. Good, powerful beer all around, suitable for an after dinner treat."
"Tasty and well balancedonce you get through all of the foam that is. The head rates as as a sculptural masterpiece. A nice complexity of flavors, but nothing dominates or seems out of place. Oh, and check out that ABV-- you'd never know by taste alone."
"Pours cloudy brown with a small creamy white head, lots of lacing. Smells quite fresh. Citrus, plums, and candy sugar on a spicy vinous alcohol base. Explosive and ever-changing flavor is quite a surprise. Begins with a sweet-and-sour kick that alternates between sugary dark fruit malts and acidic wine notes. Brings toasted bread notes and significant spicy medicinal alcohol warmth in the center. Finishes with prickly spice-tinged alcohol. Medium body with excellent blend of carbonation and creaminess. A real winner all around!"
"I gotta get to this brewery some day..."
"Overall Impression: Package works well together, very Belgian, good craftsmanship, but it just didnt inspire me."
"Interesting offering from this brewery; well-crafted and complex."
"A murky chestnut brown beer with a tan head that dissipates fairly quickly. Th enose smells of champagne and yeast, wine like flavors. Heavy raisin, prune, and malty swetness await the drinker. A truly different beer, but not something I want to drink mre than one of."
"exceptional spicy sweet flavors mask the alcohol well and allow you to savor the depth and character"
"As I mentioned, drinkability is greatly impaired by the carbonation, however, that being said, the abv is hardly noticeable. All in all, a very mediocre beer in my opinion, and one I doubt I will partake in again any time soon."
"Unique, that's for damn sure. Not quite the world-shattering experience I hoped it would be, but well worth the trip nonetheless."
"Somewhat course on the tongue with a hot alcohol aspect carrying with it hints of sherry and overripe cherries. A muted nuttiness accompanies it all. Finish is tinged by alcohol and tart."
"D - A couple of these would be fine. I think this brewery is great, but this isn't my favourite of their beers and I'd look towards others within the style."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with the molasses like sweetness that quickly turns into a mild sourness that is enjoyable and fits into what they were trying to do."
"A very unique brew. Highly drinkable and very interesting."
"Time will tell..."
"Taste was slightly acidic with cherries which reminds me of a robust red wine, meaning heavy and complex. Does the acidic taste come from Brettanomyces? There is some stickiness on my lipps. In the end there is some melon and raisins. Mouthfeel is medium which make the beer very drinkable, if not for the ""heaviness"" of the beer."
"Pours a reddish color with substantial off- white head. The smell is massive- I can rate the smell across the room; Tart candy smell with apples and melons. Taste is nice and rich; very comple with some smoky tart flavors in effect. Taste goes on forever, with candied fruits, rasins, figs, and old sherry. Smooth and full in the mouth. This is a nice treat. Not for daily or multiple consumption, but very good."
"33cl bottle: Mine poured out a hazy mahogany color, with about no head at all. Pretty strong and nice aroma. Definite raisins, yeast and breadiness. Lesser notes of apple and caramel. really no alcohol other than a faint bit in the background. The texture is lightly syrupy. The taste is somewhat sweet, with caramel and toffe the first you get. some of the fruits come through in the aftertaste. A good sipper, but I dont think I could drink more than 1."
"D - This was a weird beer."
" For a Belgian, I'm not entirely impressed. My first Oerbier was had about a year ago. I don't know what I had prior to that, however, I recall it being a bit sweeter and smoother. On that recollection, I went out and bought a case. This review is based on the first bottle out of that case. Here in, lies the problem with the 'case only law' in Pa. There were a lot of other beers that I would have chosen over this one had I had the opportunity to buy just one bottle to jog my memory. While I'd never pour this beer down the drain, I can name at least twenty other Belgians that I would take over this one."
"I tried it once, probably won't get it again."
"Overall, this is not the most interesting Belgian. Very sweet and powerful, but it's a one-trick (or, at best, a two-trick) pony. Still a good beer, but compared with the lofty achievements of other De Dolle beers, the Oerbier is a bit of a letdown."
"A very good strong dark ale."
"Outstanding."
"Drinkability: Outstanding. Oerbier is, for me, one of the finest dark belgian ales availalbe. I would take this over quite a few of the trappist creations any day."
"Notes: The drinkability goes down because of the high carbonation. You can tell that there is a lot of alcohol in this beer, but its smooth. As with all the other De Dolle beers, they are wonderful, a perfect beer for people who have drank a lot of high flavor Belgian beers. I with there was a little more malt to balance out the strong phenols. Other than that, good stuff."
"From notes. This beer poured a deep brown with ruby hues with a finger of head light khaki head that maintained well through the drink. Nose was slightly like black currant..fruity and sharp. There were notes of light raisin and light cherry. Nothing was overly strong, but nice. Flavor was much like the nose. Solid black currant and raisin with a toasty character on the finish. There was a faint tart zing to it that I enjoyed. The feel was moderate with a nice tight moderate carbonation that kept it easy drinking. Overall, I thought this was enjoyable. The nose was a touch light, but the flavor and feel worked well in this one."
"33 cl bottle. Oerbier pours out a murky, dark brown color with a huge, off-white head that slowly fades to a thin layer. Apples and dark fruit in the aroma, along with a strange cheese-like smell lurking in the background. Very malty flavor, but not overly sweet. Dark fruit, lemon, and some spices. Despite the big, malty flavor, this beer is not at all cloying. In fact, it is somewhat refreshing. The abv is fairly well hidden, although certainly noticable. Creamy mouthfeel. Fantastic drinkability. An all-around great beer."
"Overall: This Belgian Strong Dark has a very nice balance between spicy and fruity flavors, with one not overpowering the other."
"Medium to almost full mouth is a little puckering and that works out nicely with the taste. This is one of the best beers I've had in a while and my only regret is not buying more."
"A bit too ponderous& intense for me, but a nice nightcap or dessert bier. Survived it's crossing well. Will tempt me to try other Belgians here. Held off until I could figure out which store cared for their beers"
"If it's been a while since you tried the Oerbier, my recommendation would be get another few bottles and sample the improvements yourself, but make sure they have the white crown caps!!"
"Found this beer marked down as a store was closing and moving to a new location. Poured a light brown that was almost cloudy with a few hues of red as I held it to the light. Very thick head that hung around and dissipated slowly. Aroma was not powerful but had a sweet malty smell. I immediately tasted sweet tea with citrus notes. I frothed it in my mouth vigorously and it literally exploded with additoional notes of orange and malty sweetness and other sugary characteristics that I have never tasted before. Almost fruity but more like raisins.Hops were almost non-existant as the alchhol was present but not dominating. Very hard to describe, but I loved it and it was very drinkable."
"Thanks Darren!!"
"Definatly enjoyable, well-suited to compliment, or to be served in lieu of, most any dessert. Puts you in that happy place."
"11.6 oz bottle pours a murky reddish brown color with a huge light brown head of large bubbles that leaves a nice lacing in my glass. Fruity chocolate aromas, sweet plum and chocolate flavors .Medium to full bodied with a tingly carbonated mouthfeel, finishes really sweet. Alcohol very well hidden and very drinkable."
"330 mL, bottle-conditioned with SPE__ BREW 2005 on the cap (some of the printing ran over the edge). It pours into the chalice a dark brown/garnet color with a good amount of carbonation beads and a 2 finger tan head that takes a long time to recede but never goes away and leaves nice lacing throughout. It smells nice and fruity with green apples, cherries, caramel, and maybe some spicy phenols. The flavor is about the same with the addition of pepper and some warmth. It has a medium to thick body that has good carbonation from the conditioning and becomes smooth. It's good, though I probably didn't identify some of the flavors and aromas, but it was a constant sipper beer that I would try again. Now to try other De Dolle offerings...."
"Overall: A pretty good beer for the style, but priced a little steep. Certainly fairly complex and interesting, one that's worth trying. The label made me laugh."
"Just picked this up today- trying all the de dolle I can find at Star's. Poured a massive head into the glass which remains nearly throughout. Deep brown hue. The taste is slightly acidic with notes of raisins or prunes with a slightly metallic aftertaste. Malty throughtout with a decent body. I would consider this again if left with fewer options from this brewery and especially if I could find it on tap."
"Drinkability: Let's face it, regardless of the maybe not-as-high-as-many-BSDAs 7.5% ABV, who wants to drink more than one at a time? Especially since the bottle was around $4.25, this is a great winter sipper, surely a treat, and positively a singular and beyond pleasant brew."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Very thin but syrupy at the same time, if that makes any sense. Tough beer to enjoy by myself... it's seriously big and bruising. I am now bleeding about the head."
"It's fresh-squeezed Belgian prunefigmalt juice with the benefit of some slightly funkified fermentation. Due to its hefty profile it is not the Belgian I'd pick for multiple consumption, but it's well worth a try for self-edification. It's got some real kick and bears close watching as you drink it. I tried this because it was there, and having done so, I'm glad I did. While it may not be something I crave, it's worthy of a return visit."
"flavor notes indicate age and a complex sweetness, but light body encourages drinkability. interesting diacetyl-infused rotten fruit tang at the end of each sip.. probably the flavor that strikes me as most unique.. in a greater size, this is the flavor that turns me off to old belgians. here, it's more of a subtle note surrounded by a generally fresh and spry mouthfeel. great belgian and a unique, balls-out beer for de dolle to call their 'flagship.' great beer for those who think stille nacht is too sweet."
"cheers..."
"Overall, an interesting brew but I obviously missed out not having much carbonation. Alcohol really stood out without it. Transported from Iowa to Indiana and stored in fridge for 2 weeks, not sure what happened..."
"Easy to drink, fun and refreshing, but I would bet this is a dangerous one at larger amounts of consumption."
"Quite spicy with candy sugar and alcoholic notes. Really mirky brown, with a large head that faded quickly. Tastes life fruit cake with lots of spicy yeast character. Goes down kindof harsh with carbonation and alcohol. I thought it was a nice drink, but it needs to condition."
" The mouthfeel is thick without being syrupy in the slightest. The drinkability is low, not because I don't like this, but the flavors would become cloying. I could probably have another one, though. IMO, pop this at cellar temperature just to taste it in that state. As for me, the next time I will start drinking this one at a warmer temperature. This has quite the finish."
"Overall - A great example of a Belgian dark ale... highly recommended..."
"This is a very unique brew, and quite drinkable. It's not all that easy to find on tap (I got mine in Joplin, Missouri), but well worth seeking out. Overall, I'd highly recommend this."
"Edit: I just saw that my review averaged out to a 4.25... I'm going to stand by the numbers I gave it, but it seems like it should rate much higher. I like it better than a few beers I have rated over a 4.5."
"Poured a murky brown with a much thinner head than expected almost non existent,the aromas more than made for the appearance big juicy fruit and dark brown suger with some alcohol dipped raisins.Wow this is one rich tasting ale dark fruit everywhere,plum and raisin really stick out with an underlying brown suger-like sweetness and the alcohol really shows itself as it warms.Nice big,thick mouthfeel coats the mouth.This seems bigger than 7.50% to me more of a night sipper,delicious."
"Bottle. Mmmm...this stuff is good! Cloudy dark amber (OK, I couldn't hold the yeast back) with plenty of fine creamy light tan head which laced prolifically and stuck around all the way through. Caramelised banana malted milkshake aroma with an almost indescribable spicy backbone. Sweet caramel/toffee start with hints of raisins and a touch of banana, spicy middle with a dry and sublty hoppy finish with a little warmth from the very well hidden alcohol. Mouth feel is perfection (my first 5), soft and creamy right the way through. YUM!"
"Mouthfeel is epic, thick and rich with a creamy slickness that just coats your entire palate. A really rich beer that is perfect for dessert, or anytime for that matter."
"I was afraid when I first tasted this that it would be too sweet, but the sweetness quickly flows into a great malt taste that leaves me wanting more. Whacky bottle, great beer."
"A fairly average beer, and one I could not finish. It went along with dinner, but maybe its the coriander and burnt toffee and orange and melon, pepper, usually a potent turnoff for my sensitive palate. Very much like a brown ale to me, and would be slightly above average if that's what it is."
"In the mouth it's smooth and luscious. (I love this beer) A huge ball of foam gathers with every sip. De Dolle can do no wrong."
"Although this is not my favorite type of beer, I can definitely see the merits in it, and understand why is has such a high rating. Pours a deep brown-red color with a minimal head. Smell is very pungent, although of what is hard to say... there are definitely some fruits in there, especially apricots and peaches. The taste is the same way, with a deluge of flavor making it hard to clearly point out tastes. Much different than other beers from this brewery, which tend to take more time with their taste. If it had to be described, the taste is like the smell... fruity, with a good amount of sugar and sweets joined in."
"Taste is complex a full to making you enjoy at least 10-15 seconds from every sip. Starting with maltyness, litle sweet carramel floating into alcohol that warms before going to a clean but heavy bitterness. Great brew that most of the time is just splendid to me."
"Last swigs: Butered pancakes with maple syrup. Deliciously sweet sugar hot. Enjoyed at TRIA for $8 a little 11.2 oz bottle, 33 cL. The highlight of this brew is the appearance and the smooth character."
"this beer pours with a wonderful head that retains well. aroma of cherries, raisons and alcohol. the beer looks as good as it tastes with a ruby huge. mouth feel is grainy but smooth. washed over and coats the tongue. leaves a great aftertaste of fruit. Also, at first it seams like the alcohol is going to overpower but it is quickly halted by the other flavors of the beer."
"Other comments: This bottle was from a case I bought at the brewery in May 2004. It has aged nicely so far. The head on this sample was pretty disappointing though, but I've had this beer before when there was copious amounts of foam. A testament to the variability of De Dolle's beers. That being said, I've never had a bad one. On the cap is printed ""10% < MAO6", whatever that means."
"The liquid is halfway between the inside meat of a plum and mahogany. Definitely lighter in color than I think of it being. Swirling bubbles and small dark chunks of sediment. Huge perfect head with heavy lacing. Smells of pepper, anise, raisin, and alcohol. Flavor is smooth dark caramel with its sweetness balanced well by not the hop bitterness really, but the spiciness. Warms the mouth like a wine, and seems a little higher than the 7.5% listed. Thick-bodied but highly carbonated too, so together it forms a perfect feel. So damn polished and smooth, head and shoulders above most other Belgians. Glory be giv'n."
"Overall:	I really like this. The first time or two, it didnt grab me. Reminds me of a lighter, less spiced version of the Stille Nacht."
"Bottle: Poured a dark color ale with a huge bubbly dark head with average retention. Aroma is quite complex and includes some smoky notes with some alcohol (scotch?). From what I could gather from the taste there is quite a mix in there: I can only describe this as a mix between a scotch ale (Mchouffe) with some smoke malt thrown in there. Alcohol is not easily detectable but can be felt on the tongue. Very different from what Ive tasted before, Im curious to try the other bottle in my cellar."
"A lot of flavors going on here. Although the abv% is well hidden in terms of flavor, it sneaks up on you if you're not paying attention. A solid version of the style and definitely worth a try. One I will be revisiting in the future."
"The beer upon its pour from the 330ml brown bottle sets in the glass a muddy brown color with the head bubbly and off white in color, the size minimal, lace is patchy. Nose is spicy over ripe apples with a tart sweetness, start is sweet and sour, the top light in feel. Finish is mildly acidic with the hops benign, sour aftertaste with hints of alcohol, a belly warmer for sure."
"33 cl bottle, no freshness dating. Pours a clear copper color with a bubbly light beige head. Notes of muted dark malts and vinous, citrus rind; a bit perfumy and lightly hoppy, too. Spicing seems evident, although not likely so, probably a unique yeast strain. First sip is caramel-like; dark cherry-malty and smooth with a bit of botanical astringency and faint sourness in the finish. Very clean tasting; I'd recommend this to a red wine lover. Buttery, slick mouthfeel. Sadly, sulfites and I don't get along, I get headaches from the sulfites added to aid the fermentation of red wine, so I haven't had a glass of red wine in years. But this beer does seem to have some red wine qualities if I recall. Smoothness is impeccable. Drying on the palate long after the sip. We're getting this beer in stock at the pub where I work, so I've found my perfect substitute if I feel like in a red wine mood. 50 lashes if I sound like a wino; I've always preferred beer, but this beer's awesome in those instances when a substitute for a wine other than wine is in order (red meats and the like...)."
"An interesting and complex beer."
"11.2 ounce bottle. This is a beer that intrigues me and has been a longtime favorite. I think it is one of the most complex and interesting beers on the planet and rated it as such."
"After a dry patch of B. United and Belgian beers I must say, this was a pleasant surprise!"
"This beer is dark brownish red and has a small head of tan that quickly subsides to a thin lace. Taken from a goblet, the smell is very sweet and rich with hints of toffee, carmel and ginger. The taste is intense, to say the least. There are some light buttery notes which are complexed by a ton of spice, which soon subsides to leave a very strong taste of gingerbread. VERY strong. The aftertaste lingers on and on and is actually quite annoying. I couldn't detect much else, though the thick mouthfeel indicates this has some alcohol to it. I wasn't very impressed, and I couldn't have more than one even if I wanted to. Whew! The little crazy gingerbread man on the label is a telling sign of the one-dimensional liquified cookie inside."
"Rich, full of depth, yeasty as hell and full of fruit notes; mainly apple and pear."
"Really a wonderful brew. Mine was a slightly murky copper-brown, yeast wasn't quite settled. Fabulous malt body and deep earthy notes. Finish had a very familiar taste, but couldn't put my finger on what it was, very pleasant though. One i'd buy time and time again. Mad Brewers keep them coming!"
"Drinkability was very nice. Great mix of malt and spice. Beautiful beer."
"Drinkability: Even as this beer warms there is no hint of the alcohol. An excellent beer for food pairing."
"The pairing was dead on. It was a marriage. The slight tartness of the beer slipped into a spicy sweetness. It's complexity danced around the food and respected all of it. I will add to my stock of this beer. It is one of the best beers I've had. It is very drinkable and a remarkable food beer."
"6yr old bottle. Muddy brown with initially big light brown head, myseriously fading into a 1cm foam, which sticks well. Nose is vinous with vinegar and oak-aged oud bruin suggestions. As the pour had indicated, there's plenty of yeast in there, but also a profound malt depth of apples, lactic cherry yogurt, blood oranges and a sweetness closing to milk chocolate. Appealing complexity already, but further sniffs have even more to offer with hints of earth, oak and saw dust. Medium bodied and sparkling, initially cherry/apple sweet, but balanced by more sourness than expected. Aftertaste can't hide the age of the sample, a little off-flavour of something alike cement or dirty grass distracts a bit from the enjoyment. I'm gonna try a fresher sample soon and make up conclusions on this aspect, but besides this, it is obviously a radious beer that fits my personal tastes with great class."
"This came out of the bottle a dense reddish brown color, topped with a thick, hearty head. Its pleasing sweet aroma hints at that characteristic Belgian flavor, without giving too much away. Smooth and creamy mouthfeel with earthy lactose undertones. This is a filling beer, falling somewhere between Maudite and a stout. This waited in my fridge for at least a month or so, and now I'm asking myself why I didn't try it earlier."
"It pours a cloudy borwn with some reddish tinit to it and a tan head that dissipated fairly fast for me. The aroma is fruity, malty, peppery and somewhat medicinal. It has a soft, yet prickly carbonation. There is plenty of fruity sweet malts with some cherry, prune, and raisin notes and some spicy phenols. There is some bitterness that helps round out the sweetness. It finishes with some fusel alcohol and a peppery spiciness. Another great beer from a great brewery."
"Carefully poured from a longstanding bottle, the body is a clear, orange-tinted chestnut beneath a full head of rocky off-white foam. A few small particles are churned about at the base of the goblet as tiny bubbles stream to the surface. The head retention is excellent, no doubt buoyed by its natural, effervescent carbonation; yet it leaves only transient lace. It's maltiness is evident in the nose, suggesting sugary candy, caramel, dried dark fruit, mustiness and soil as well as a splash of alcohol. The body is medium-full, and it's natural, effervescent carbonation foams up upon entering the mouth and lends a tingle to the tongue. It's rich, fruity malt dominates the flavor but some hops are able to slip through lending it a bit of a licorice note. Dark dried fruits (raisins, prunes), some yeasty phenolics, and a clear note of alcohol give it depth. It's backed by a solid bitterness that balances its maltiness and leads to a short dry finish with a touch of dark fruit and lingering phenolic."
"Feel has a good fuzzy/fluffy carbonation and texture that comes across the whole way through. Has a bit of crispness and dryness in parts just before the finish, but mostly the malts surge in a gradual smoothness as it goes down with yeasty spices grabbing around the edges; considerably exquisite drinkability with this first-rate ale. Yum! I think I'll have another thank you."
"Drinkability: A damn fine benchmark for this style, albeit a very peppery and (Belgian) hoppy one. This is a beer that seems to be emulated on the American continent quite frequently. For the money, I'll take Maudite, though."
"I found this beer somewhat unusual. Poured a murky brown with a nice white head and loads of white sediment. Aroma was of apples, other tart fruits, and alcohol. Flavor was sour above all - a rather nice and refreshing sour however. Unfortunately, I didn't get much else from the taste. Except some alcohol and fruity malt. Mouthfeel was surprisingly smooth, but very slightly prickly. Fairly refreshing brew."
"poured an ugly murkey, muddy brown, but with a fabulous thick, tall, rocky head. Smelled of fermenting tropical fruits, apricots, pears, bannanas with a hint of alcohol. Taste was the same, fruity, overripe apple and sweet & sour flavors, winding up with an alcohol flavor at the end. It had some sweet dryness to the finish that didn't leave me with a sickly sweet aftertaste or an alcohol flavor. The beer was quite enjoyable to drink, easy to quaff."
"pour out a mega murky, monsterous foamy amber colour. sediment worked up and poured in also. did i mention the huge rocky and foamy head? lots of lace. sour yeast aroma...did i expect anything less from this belgian bombshell? fizzy, carbonated mouthfeel gives way to a fruity, alcohol burn. too many of these and you might really start seeing the cute cartoonish characters on the labels of these de dolle brews. medium bodied. spicy, peppery alcohol aftertaste. no messing around here. a brutal bruiser of a brew."
"Drinkability: Excellent beer. I fully enjoyed this one and could make it a regular in my cellar...if i could actually find one in Canada."
"Medium body, with an aftertaste that is a mixture of bitter and alcohol."
"FYI: Must let this one warm up and get prolonged air exposure for the taste and flavor, and to let the carbonation calm down so your tongue can taste and feel it."
"These notes relect the beer when they were still using the Rodenbach yeast. Appearance: Red with some brown. Cloudy. Big, rocky head. Aroma: Big tartness. Mellowing out to malty sweetness. Flavor: Very sour, nice malty sweetness. Good sweet/sour balance with some caramel. Finish: Tart, sour, and nice sweetness. Drinkability: The sweet/sour balance makes for a wonderfully drinkable beer."
"Poured in a LaTrappe chalice to get a handle on the famed de Dolle foam, still, powers up to 1/2 an inch. Broad lace. Dark nutmeg brown, plenty of sediment. Aroma is first rate, notes of raspberry and vanilla, with scant yeastiness. Very fruity flavor, pear and cherry with ginger and a restrained fizzy mouthfeel. Not overly sweet, fresh fruit astringency and a good amount of hop bitterness at the close. I like it, not nearly so heavy and sugary sweet as I was expecting -- this broke through as bright."
"Drinkability  This was a welcome surprise after tasting a really bad beer that I oned. It was on-style yet unique, making for a pleasurable experience."
"Has a sharp fruity aroma. It tastes nicely sweet with a caramel slightly bitter finish. This is quite good, with a perfect amount of sourness & complexity. When De Dolle is on they are quite good, even one of the best. Unfortunately they can have bottles that are downright off, I am rating this for one of the good bottles, keep on dumping until you find a good one."
"A murky looking brown ale with a tan head which quickly settled down to a slight creamy dense head. The aroma is sweet, fruity and with a biscuit like aroma. Dates, plumbs and figs come to mind. Creamy mouthfeel and a medium to almost full body finishing with a slight warming sensation. Flavor is malty with a slight tart fruitiness. Overall a very good Belgian"
"Dark brown color, Very large head. Malty and rich. Robust flavor. Complex taste, nutty, nearly oakey. Somewhat vineous. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean. Aftertaste is slightly bitter. Interesting beer. Very complex taste. High alcohol content."
"It pours a murky brown with lots of floaties. Like other de Dolle beers, Oerbier presents a big craggy head that's as sticky as flypaper. It smells like a big glass of dessert: raisins, cherries, chocolate, and a hint carmelized sugar. The flavor is wonderfully complex, with ripe fruit and noticeable but not overwhelming alcohol flavor. The mouthfeel is full and satisfyingly appropriate for the smell and taste. It's certainly no session beer, but it is quite drinkable for a 7.5% beer. With all the beer gone, the inside of the glass looks a bit like the the top of a creme brulee."
"Murky swamp brown, like natural apple cider gone bad...explosive carbonation forms a nice beige head after a careful pour. Retention is good and lacing is good, helping to save the look of the beer. This is an ugly beer, but that is not what matters. For some people, the natural appearance of this beer may be attractive...but these are the type of people who prefer their women unshaven:) Aroma is mouthwatering...sour green apples, apple cider, sangria, plenty of sourness and belgian funk. Mouthfeel is fizzy at first, then melds into a cloying wet finish with a medium-thin body despite it's obvious strength. Taste begins with lots of green apples and hard apple cider. The candi sugar makes itself very noticeable towards the middle with a ruddiness and some heavy fusel/acetyl alcohols are noted before the finish. The finish is cloying, with a persistant sweetness. Hops are minimal in flavor, aroma or bitterness. It burns as it goes down, and it will give one a decent buzz. This used to be one of my favorite beers of all-time 10 years ago...I remember this beer being more sour, less heavy on the fusels, and infinitely more drinkable. Perhaps the beer changed, but it's more likely that my tastes have changed. Still, it holds a sentimental place in my heart."
"Another fantastic and unusual brew from the Mad Brewers of Belgium! My thanks go out to StevieW for including this in our recent trade."
"F."
"The dark chestnut color was hidden by a thin white head that mostly faded and left some chunky lace as consumed. Lots of sediment clouded this brew but the active carbonation still managed to work its way thru it quickly. Maple and sour cherry dominated the aroma. The fruity tastes of cherrys and plums are strong but don't hide the alcohol very well. Altough i enjoyed this brew it did take awhile to drink."
"Major foam eruption upon pouring - head recedes to a fluid mass of tiny bubbles that blankets the beer and remained when it was ( sadly) gone, clinging to the chalice. Deep, clear copper color with dark granular yeast clumped in the bottom and surprisingly little cloudiness. Musty, wine like aroma with definite notes of sour and fresh fruit. Flavor changes to tart, fresh fruit; melon and raisin mix with firm hop bittering and a hint of smoked nuts. Full bodied mouth feel with a finish that explodes with hop charactor and searing alcohol that reminds me of vodka. Rich and fruity, solidly hoppy and warmingly alcoholic. De Dolle, like De Ranke are 2 of my De Favorite breweries!"
"Bracing, bold, and delicious! My guess on the style would be either a high-alcohol brown ale, or maybe a souped-up Scotch, either way, several notches above what I'd expect. At 7.7%, I'm starting to feel it, too! Wonderful, chewy texture, full body, altogether excellent! Much thanks to Marc77 for making this possible!"
"A stunner. Thanks, Bighuge."
"I like this beer a lot."
"Drinkability: Good. Grows on you as you drink it. Again, to me it was enhanced if the yeast sediment was included in the pour."
"Thanks for the recommendation, StevieW!! This is indeed an exceptional beer (even amongst many other Belgian beers). Poured an unbelievable head (I waited about 10 minutes to start drinking it!). I can't call it lace, because the foam covered my glass all the way through until I finished it. Amber color, spicy and smooth. Reminded me of Maudite (and maybe Kwak). Creamy and delicious. As is the case with many Belgian beers, it is a little on the sweet side. If you love Belgian beer and haven't had this yet, find it."
"My highest compliment......Magic in a glass !"
"Hazy dark cider color with fluffy head, mild yeasty aroma with hints of overripe peaches and grapes. Lots of candy sugar flavors here, a very light sourness hidden at the back, smooth finish with little residuals except for sugar. This is quite a hearty beer, big sugary malts and very little hops except for perhaps a tart green apple quality. A good beer but almost too sweet and sugary for me; maybe a big plate of bloody meat would have made me appreciate this beer more than just drinking it solo."
"Dark brown with all kinds of floaties.  Uncontrollable head.  Sweet malty aroma, heavy on the dark candied fruits.  Starts off sweet with dried apricots, plums, and cherries.  Turns mildly cidery, a bit lactic.  Nice full mouthfeel.   Not too much different than other Belgian dark strong ales that have a high concentration of dark candi sugar, in a good way."
"Turbid garnet in hue, topped by a typically dense off white head that dissipates at a painfully slow rate.  The aroma is comprised of tart fruit esters accompanied by powdery dry cocoa and subdued bubblegum.  An enticing nose, but not quite as aromatic as other examples of the style.  Flavorwise, candy - like sweetness is quickly followed by mellow chocolate and banana esters.  A hint of bubblegum is present as well.  Moderate in body, w/ an agreeable mouthfeel that adds to the drinkability.  Finishes w/ quickly fading residual sweetness and trace phenol.  Oerbier is certainly a tasty brew, but it seemed to fall a bit short on the depth of flavor and complexity I was craving. Like a good dark strong, the sweetness was well controlled and not cloying, however.  I look forward to their Stille Nacht."
"Interesting brew, some along of a Belgian Red Ale, firm choc maltiness, balanced with a nice cherry like acidic sourness, very different and creative beer."
"Incredible thick clingy head with nice fingers similar to their Stille Nacht.  Sweet candy/sugar flavors.  Nicely malty and no real bitterness to be found.  Overall a good beer, but I much prefer the Stille Nacht."
"My oh my this beer brought me to my knees, last had this one in a beer bar in Brussels called La Porte Noire (sp?) which is located in an 1800's brick cellar. Nice to see that we can get it in the states now."
"Had this one at t'Brugs Beertje, here's my notes: dark ripe fruits, some dextrin sweetness, semi-sour, vinous qualities, very raisiny with slight burnt characters. Now that was day 3 in Belgium and after many (MANY) beers. I do remember it being one of the best that I tried. All of De Dolle's brew are."
