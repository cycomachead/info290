"Very tasty QUAD with Belgian/Brown ale elements.  Most interesting experience that any one who likes QUUD/Belgian and or Brown ale should try at least once."
""
""
"Overall a solid good beer.  It wasn't what I initially expected, but perhaps that's part of its charm.  Not for someone who's not used to a little sourness in a dark aged ale, this is a beer for Belgian lovers to sip, dissect, and enjoy."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I find this beer to be highly drinkable, especially for its ABV.  It really clicks for me."
""
"A definite hit that makes all the misses completely worthwhile."
"This is a good beer"

"Beautiful head! Can float a bottle cap. Love the dark rich color. Nutty flavor goes well with a sweet coconut dessert."
""
"Overall:  This is another very, very good Belgian brown ale!  A little more fruity and earthy than other Belgian Brunes that I’ve had, which is pleasantly different.  Reminds me of Goulden Drak."
""
"Pours a beautiful black-brown burgundy color. Dates, figs, and spices, with a sweetness balanced by a slight booziness and a pleasantly bitter undertone."
""

"O: Very nice belgian strong dark. Initial flavor is a little light but turns into a nice strong belgian brown. Makes me think of a double...dubbel. Imperial dubbel? Not really a quad, it's just a strong dubbel. At least, that's how I'm perceiving it. Nice complexity and balance of flavors. Drinkability is top, top notch and elevated my scoring a bit. Goes down really easily for a 9% beer."
"Delivers exactly what a Belgian brown should: medium reddish brown color, toasty malt in the aroma,and a subtle sweetness on the tongue. Very enjoyable."

"Not picking up much fruit or spice. Highly carbonated and malty. Very unimpressed."

"Pours a deep brown with a thin beige head that quickly dissipates; a small thin disc of head hangs on in the middle of the goblet. The aroma is rich deep fruit and some alcohol. The taste is similar to the aroma but just a little bit more robust. It has a nice thick feeling to the body and a smooth finish."
"Comes off like a somewhat spritzy tight Belgian ale, but isn't overboard on the sweetness.  Handles classic dark fruit component real nicely too.  Solid brew."

"Pours a clear dark brown with slight reddish tint, cola like fizzy offwhite head. Smell: toasted brown bread, cola, cherry, brown sugar, peppers. Taste: cola, fruity: dried apricot, fig; brown sugar, brown bread, earthy and peppery in the finish. Easy drinker at 9% though the carb is a little aggressive."
""
""
""
"One of the best brown ales out there.  Smooth texture and great taste.  With a abv @ 9.0 makes it perfect to enjoy a couple at a time.  Highly recommend."
"Excellent brown ale. Pours reddish-brown, with a thick head. Would get again, and wish it was available more often in my location."
""
""
"An easy drinking ale that is true to form."
""
""
"This one really hit the spot. As soon as it was poured, a picturesque head of beige foam rose up above the muddy body, bringing with it aromas of estery dark fruits. Each sip was balanced and subtle in its complexity - sweet, slightly nutty malt, earthy mushroom, molasses, and rich fig and date flavors abound, a combination of tastes that left me chewing the palate slowly and deliberately. Truly a meal in a glass."
""
""
"Pours a slightly reddish dark brown with a single finger of white foamy head. Lacing is nice and is long lasting. Smell is of figs and cherries and other sour fruits, but not extremely prevalent. Taste is again of dark fruits but very balanced by nice spicy hops. Hoppier than expected but very good. Alcohol comes in towards the end but gives the flavor a nice little kick that works well. Moderate carbonation. Quite a good brew."

"I drank this splendid Belgian beer at the Map Room in Chicago, Illinois. It pours brown, has a stormy look, and a moderate head. It has little lacings and decent carbonation. it has the taste of coffee, hops, and dehydrated fruits, it has hints of wheat and caramel. It has a strong body, very filling, strong after taste of coffee, and a little edge due to the alcohol content."
""
"What an excellent Belgian Brown Ale, nice malty sweet and mild sour sensation and great complexity. Highly recommendable."
"750 ml bottle into tulip glass, best before 1/28/2015. Pours crystal clear deep ruby red color with a 2 finger fairly dense khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of big raisin, plum, fig, pear, apple, banana, caramel, toast, biscuit, candi sugar, light chocolate, bubblegum, herbal, floral, light pepper, and yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of fruity/earthy yeast and dark malt notes; with great strength. Taste of raisin, plum, pear, apple, fig, banana, caramel, toast, biscuit, candi sugar, light chocolate, light bubblegum, pepper, herbal, floral, and yeast earthiness. Fair amount of earthy yeast spiciness on the finish; with lingering notes of raisin, plum, pear, apple, fig, banana, caramel, toast, biscuit, light chocolate, candi sugar, light bubblegum, light pepper, herbal, floral, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice complexity of fruity/earthy yeast and dark malt flavors; with a great malt/yeast flavor balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a smooth, crisp, and lightly slick/pricky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a excellent Belgian strong dark ale. All around great complexity and balance of fruity/earthy yeast and dark malt flavors; and very smooth and crisp to sip on for the ABV. A very enjoyable offering."

"Brought this home in my suitcase from my honeymoon in Belgium, thankfully fully intact. We had a wonderful visit to the brewery and friendly tour and conversation with the brewer. Great brewery! This beer is quite a treat. Fantastic aroma and flavor of dark fruit, chocolate, and a slight finish of honey. Very drinkable for 9%abv. I didn't find it ""light"" necessarily, but very drinkable. A lot of flavor, very complex. One of my favorite beers and breweries from my trip to Belgium. Cheers!"
""
"This was very nice and easily drinkable once you adjust with a very good array of flavors."

"Overall I'll admit I never heard of this beer before today though I was not let down. The big fruit aroma was awesome and was tough to stop this guy from whiffing. Flavor wasn't as strong, but a nice beer for the style."
"Presentation: Packaged in a 750 ml brown glass Belgian bomber with a cork and cage, served in a New Belgium Brewing chalice."

"Pours a deep, dark brown. Smells like raisins and figs. Got that smell that Belgians usually have, but with a dark, rich fruity flavor. The taste reminds me of figs, raisins, an d plumb skins. The mouth feel is good and a little complex. Makes my tastebuds think. First time I've had a beer like this. I really enjoy it."

"A friend brought this 750ml ""Belgian brown"" back from Missouri last week. No dating indicated on bottle. Interesting ""trippy"" label. We consumed this beer from Rose and Crown Pub English nonic style glasses. The cork released with a loud ""pop"" almost propelling itself from my fingers as I broke it loose from its firm grasp of the bottle. Quite chill hazed and bronze in color with some red hues in the mix. Off white 2-3 finger bubbly head leaves behind large webbing of lace. Highly vinous but slightly sweet vinegar to the nose backed my nutty brown malt. Flavor is very fruity, sweet, and quite tart verging on sour. Toasted malt lingers but is overcome by the tartness. Really not much in the way of hop bitterness. There is an obvious woody oak character in the back of this beer. Carb is pleasant and somewhat silky and feel is full. 9% abv provides dryness and warmth. All this leads me to think of this as a Flanders red ale more than what I perceive as a Belgian Dark Strong. The abv and location of the brewery in extreme South Belgium just miles from France has much to do with this terminology as well. I feel this is probably a beer that should be savored slowly with a meal at the dinner table to fully appreciate it."

"Pours a deep hazy rusty red brown with a medium beige head. Aroma of caramel malt, some dark fruit and plum esters. Taste is of caramel malt, Belgian yeast, some dark fruit favors of black plums, figs, brown sugar with a bit of tartness and mild bitterness. Palate is medium body, smooth with mild carbonation, a slightly sticky mouth feel. Finish is caramel malt, Belgian yeast, dark fruit of plums, mild tartness and bitterness with some sweet brown sugar and alcohol on the end with some lingering sweet yeast and plums. Overall a very good, smooth and flavorful brew."

"O: Oh man this is a good beer. I will naturally recommend it to those who are fans of Belgian beers, especially dark ales, but I think that fans of sweet stouts or dessert style beers will find this very appealing. I will look for this beer again in the future."
""
""
""
"O - Very well balanced, enjoyable Belgian amber. Nothing really stood out or set it apart for me, but it was definitely very nice, complex, and enjoyable. Certainly a beer I will return to again."

"Poured this Belgian Strong Dark Ale from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. Poured a dark brown/reddish color- produced a nice tannish head, great retention and left excellent lacing on the glass. The aroma consisted of plums, pears and yeast. Full bodied, there is a foundation of roasted malt, pear, plum, chocolate, berries and belgian yeast- dry finish. Very complex flavors, this is for sure beer that is to be sipped. Complex flavors remind me of drinking a dark red wine."
"Overall: love a good Belgian beer in this style and this one is an amazing example with wonderful depth, complexity, and full mouthfeel"
"O - Very nice. Good representation for the style. Think I might try to pick some more up before they're all gone."
""
"Nostradamus has a seductiveness that has less to do with its flavour and more in its ability to help you forget about the world in the recesses of alcohol. Still, come cold temperatures and dark nights, it is an invaluable asset. And while fashions change with time, rich and malty strong ales such as this are truly timeless. My prediction: you'll like it."
""
"O: My final thoughts are, this is like a Goose Island Nut Brown on steroids. A brown taken to stratospheric heights. Not for everybody, but really just excellent overall."
"Probably not going to buy again, but always glad to try another BSDA. Increases my appreciation for those breweries who really nail the style."

"Drinkable, bur really just average, not worth all the plaudits here. Nothing leaps out to make you say wow. Uninteresting."
"Deep brown colour with red highlights. Large beige head, good retention and lace. Fragrant with notes of cherry, brown sugar, plum, yeast and nuts. Boozy, but nicely so. Complex flavour - plum and cherry notes are underscored by a finish of gentle acidity. It's malty and slightly sweet as well, with cookie dough and toasted nut. This hides the alcohol well on the palate. Medium-bodied with abundant carbonation. Feels light in the mouth, but not in the thin sort of way. A beer that manages to be both approachable and somewhat complex at the same time."

"M: Medium body. Carbonation but has a bite on the tongue. Sweetness is not bothersome and the finish is great. I find the carbonation to have a bite but other then that...amazing."
""
""
"Deep brown with some ruby red coming through, cap of off white head, not much in the way of lace. Smell is yeasty and a little funky, followed by some herbal anise and dark fruits, corriander perhaps in there as well, plum, raisin, mild brown sugar, some metalic/sour points when cold that seemed to fall of as it warmed. Taste has lots of dark fruits with some spicy herbal flavours, touch of yeast, malty dark breads, raisin, a little sweeter and fruity in the finish. Medium carbonation, medium-full body. Nice dark belgian, nose is a bit odd but certainly drinkable and quite enjoyable, surely something that will age nicely."
"O - A superb beer that I enjoyed as much as I'd hoped I would. I like it. I like it a lot."
"Overall, quite a nice BSDA. Not a world class beer but very nice. A pleasure."

"O - Pretty good."

"(4.25) D: Very tasty with quite an overall subtle yet refined taste profile with some wonderful flavours coming through. Would definitely purchase again."
"Interesting Belgian dark that I found I enjoyed more and more with each sip."
"Dark chestnut color with a small light beige head that evaporates quickly to leave a few bubbles. Aroma of roasted malts. Flavor of caramel and toffee, a bit sweet, but nice balance. Medium body. Nice example of the style and would defiantly buy again."
"Overall - Not as good as I was expecting.. there is a little bit too much medicine/anise like flavour and the carbonation level was too high. It's not a bad beer by any means, I was just expecting more."
"O: A really good beer. Complex, deep flavors. A nice combination of the flavors of a brown ale with the Belgian characteristics."
""
""
""
""

"O - This stuff is quite tasty, a high octane brew that is dangerously drinkable. Nice to see this brew made it to the Northwest and will definitely be picking up an extra bottle or two before they're all gone."

"75cl bottle from Belgian Beer Shop.com. Nostradamus is a dark brown ale with a thick, beige head. The aroma is very complex with dark fruits, lots of yeast, malty, sweet, spicy, vinous. The taste is like the aroma very complex; the alcohol presence is very clear. Sweet, malty and spicy. This is a wonderful beer, ideal after a good meal"

"All in all a very interesting beer. A mix of a brown ale and a sour. Not somethign I would drink every day, but would definitely try again."
""
""
""

"Mouthfeel: Full side of medium. Thick with just enough carbonation to help clear the palate."
""
"O-a very flavorful dark ale with good depth, could use a little more body and less forward alcohol, but overall very enjoyable"
""
"Overall a pleasant surprise, this beer to me is a bit overlooked but I decided to give it a try. A nice beer, but this is one of my favourite styles of beers so I am biased. Not mindblowing though."
""
""
""
"O- A very interesting belgian, and easily to be said a great one! I just simply enjoy every part of this fine crafted beer. You cannot be disappointed if you enjoy the style. Worth the buy at a reasonable price, give it a try!"
""
"O: Delicious Belgian dark brew – would be perfect at Christmas time. Nice sipping beer at 9.5%."
"Not a bad beer, but it just doesn't appeal to me. It is probably the overpowering coffee taste that is pleasant on the nose as it is balanced by other flavors that I am not able to taste. I don't think that I will drink this again for the said reasons, but you should give it a try at least once."

""

"Pours a murky crimson-brown with a foamy khaki head that settles to a small cap on top of the beer. Foamy rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is of toasted malt, dark fruits, brown sugar, caramel, and slight spice aromas. Taste is much the same with a very grape-like flavor and an alcohol kick on the finish. There is a mild amount of spice bitterness on the palate after each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer that is tasty and easy to drink."
""
""
""
""
"Review from 9/2010 notes. Poured into a Nostradamus flute glass. Pours a dark orange brown amber with a slight off-white head leaving a ring around the glass. Aroma of dark fruits, light spice and hint of sour. Sweet dark fruits, a bit of cherry and malts progressing to a bittersweet, somewhat dry finish. Nice progression of flavors; quite nicely made. Medium bodied with pleasant carbonation. Another nice Caracole."

"What better than a piece of Belgian chocolate to go with this sweetie?"

"Overall this was an impressive beer I would recommend it to anyone who wants to broaden their beer horizon."
"Overall: This is a very well balanced beer with lots of fruitiness and plenty of complexity in the taste. Lighter, fruitier and easier to drink than most of it's kin, definitely worth trying."
"(bottle, 750ml) Tried on the recommendation of Nicolette at WoB near UCF in Orlando. Hazy, ruby amber color with a beige foamy head of medium size. Intensively nutty and toasty malty aroma with caramel, mocha beans and a Port-like alcoholic note. Sweet flavor, full-bodied with a smooth mouthfeel. Toast-malty taste with caramel and chocolate flavors, as well as subtle notes of dried fruits and mocha; sweet and roasty bitter finish with a warming but non-aggressive alcohol and a slightly fruity aftertaste. Balanced and complex brew. Very enjoyable."
""
"Pours a real nice deep brown with a head that fizzled pretty quick down to nothing. Smell is great. Gts some chocolate with a roasty malt and some good vanilla notes mixed in. Fresh basil too. Taste is very refined. Alcohol is masked very well so it is an easy drinker. Mouthfeel is full. Great brew."
"D: Overall a great example of this style. I would easily buy this again, and would like to try it next to some of my favorites to see how it stacks up."

"original review on: 08-15-2010"

"Half finger rapidly dissipating head on a murky brown with garnet hues body. Sweet dark fruit aroma but not too strong. Flavor is a touch watery but this is an old batch I think. Fruity, mostly strawberry, with a spices corriander note in the finish. Smooth, medium body and moderate to high carbonation. Overall highly drinkable and flavorful."
""
""
""
"O: Very good combination, completely and well drinkable beer."
""
""
""
"D: This is one of my friend's all time favorites, so I tried it based on her recommendation. Quite drinkable and one of the better strong brown ales I've had."
"O- Very good, but I like Caracole's paler offerings a bit better."
""
""
"O - A big thanks to tnip23 for sharing a bottle of this with me for a birthday present...it held up pretty well...I think some of the flavors may have fallen off, but it still has enough depth with strong flavors"
"Definitely a sipper and one to share with friends, but make sure you get a good cross-section of this beer. The top half is a bit different from the bottom as the yeast sits down there. Also definitely let this one warm up to close to 55 degrees. This seemed ideal for all of the characteristics of this beer to shine. Great beer, definitely recommended by me."
""
""

"D: Fantastic brew that I'll have to visit again. One that can be shared with friends or saved all for yourself."

"D - easy drinking but sipping and warming will bring out some more fruit notes."
"The beer appears relatively hazy and sunburst orange to ruby in color with a half inch of thick beige head that leaves plenty of lacing in its wake. The aroma brings cherries, malt, yeast - lovely. Sweet cherries balanced by classic Belgian yeast strain and a strong malt backbone. Great stuff. Some lingering alcoholic warmth in the finish. More sweet than sour for sure, but a subtle tartness keeps the sweet aspect (tempered by a delicious Belgian yeast strain) from ever becoming cloying. Cherries and yeast are the star of this show. A beer I will definitely have again. Recommended."
"Pours a reddish brown color with a one finger cocoa head. Decent lacing on my New Belgium glass. The nose is raisin, rum, plum, cherry, and a slight sourness to it. Really complex and well done. The taste is nice, almost a Flanders red vibe or old bruin vibe. A sweet candy flavor as well in the taste. Feel is medium full with sweet candy/sour finish. Very complex in all aspects. Overall, a great beer, although I think it's listed in the wrong style. Cheers"
""

"This beer poured out as a nice looking dark red color with a light tan colored head on top. the smell of the beer was soft with some dark fruit and roasted grains on the nose. The taste of the beer has a little bit of a tart flavor in it with some sweet dark fruits in there too. It's also got a dry bitter aftertaste. The mouthfeel of the beer was pretty good, it had a decent amount of carbonation to it. Overall it's not a bad brew at all, I would drink it again sometime."
"Overall a good beer that I will buy again."

"O - Exceptional BSDA that I would highly recommend."
"Big, viscous, sweet ale. Intricate dark flavors, but I find myself wishing for something that would cut through them. The cloying eases off after it opens, but that takes a while. But very round, a good by the fire beer."
"jd"
"mouthfeel - light as hell body, decent carbonation. way too thin. not impressed here"
"Overall: You know, this really is a complex, dark strong and interesting beer. The flavors go together so well, but they are flavors that I do not necessarily prefer. I might return to this one one day (as its a regular at my Trader Joe's). However, I do not think that this beer justifies a $18 price tag for a four pack."
"Overall - VERY interesting brew, and definitely worth the taste."
"Nostradamus is a very good Belgian where the flavors of the yeast shine. It is not too thick or ""syrupy"". It also provides the health benefits of the sediment."
"Pours a solid dark brown with garnet highlights when held to light, smallish beige head sticks around but slowly becomes a cap on top. Caramel, prunes, burnt sugar, dark fruits fill the air as soon as I pop the cap on this bad boy. Sweet dark sugar malty aroma with nary a hop in sight, er ah smell. Taste is sweet, caramel, brown sugar, dark pitted fruit fill the palette. Hints of warming alcohol come and go but help to break up the sweetness. Has some doppelbock qualities to it. Thick body with a modest level of carbonation and a sweet almost syrupy mouthfeel. Great Belgian Strong Dark! I might have to see if I can get this locally."
"Sampled on August 14, 2011 during the Julio's Liquors Belgian Beer Festival. It pours someplace between dark copper brown to dark amber with a moderate head. What surprises me is that along with the candied malts there is a rather nutty sensation on the nose. The body loses its structure when I swirl it on my tongue. The taste is similar to the aroma with a more blatant nutty sweetness up front and a dry, hop bite at the end."
"O: Excellent. I will pick up a bottle, if I can ever find it, when i see it. I really enjoyed this guy."
"O: I love the complex taste. A lot of strong flavors coming together. Sweet without offending. A strong alcohol presence that warms more than bites. A very nice ale!"
"I would definitely drink this again."
"Overall: Not bad, not great"
"O: A tasty Belgian Strong Dark Ale which has an interesting taste profile by how it starts bitter but ends sweet."
"Pours a very dark mahogany, with some muted ruby highlights visible when held to the light. Foamy cream coloured head, with some mild retention and minor lacing. Nose of dried fruits, some raisin and dates, faint grapes, brown sugar and some sweeter notes. An almost roasted quality with a touch of vanilla. Taste holds some brown sugar, caramelized dark fruits with a relatively substantial alcohol punch. Lighter chocolate notes, and the mildest of metallic notes. Medium full feel with a significant effervescene. Alcohol stings and clears the nostrils here, and really impedes its drinkability. Maybe something I should've saved for the winter months."
"O: Fantastic beer. It merits my highest recommendation. I would go out of my way to look for this beer. Simply magnificent."
"O: This was a ""I haven't seen this one before so I'll try it"" sort of buys, but I'm not disappointed, would buy again."
"D- very glad i waited and didn't drink this one too young and i recommend everyone else do the same. ridiculously drinkable for such a big belgian! i don't even have any left to go with the prized amish bleu cheese, let alone all the extra exclamation points. the mother with these amazing complex high abv belgians is that i keep digging for more flavors and ways to explain them and then... the bottle just isn't big enough. now i got this french michel cracka with a telescope flyin around in my head i'm like bitch get out of there before something bad happens... (in the future!)"
"O: Not something I would seek out all the time or drink more then one of. I would rather have one and enjoy it. I would definitely have this one again though."
"Poured a hazy medium brown with a large fizzy light brown head that rapidly dissipated and had poor lacing. The aroma was heavy with caramel malts and a sweet doughy yeast with a hint of dried fruit, some spices and a strong wine scent. It tasted moderately sweet with a strong dried fruit note at first and finished ever so lightly sour-sweet with a nice caramel flavor and a mild alcohol tinge at the end with the flavor lasting and average duration. Mouthfeel was light to medium in body and a little syrupy in texture with a mild carbonation. Overall a nice refreshing change to the typical Belgian Strong Ale."
"lots of heavy flavors of rich fruits and woods with a light touch in the carbonation. very pleasant taste lingers."
"Dr: Very drinkable, with a high ABV that is unnoticeable, and adequate refreshment. Pretty fairly priced for an import at 4.40 quid in Strasbourg."
"Excellent brew."
"medium to high body, the crisping sensation was not expected to be so high"
"Overall, this is a very good beer that would go nice with a full dinner. I recommend it to people who like Belgian ales and slightly sweet brews."
"D: Not my favourite brew, thought it wasn't as balanced and it could have been."
"Good for after dinner sipping. I don't know how well this shows in the much-traveled bottle. I'd like to try it on tap to see if the flavors might be fresher and more focused."
"Reddish brown. The nose feels strongly the cellar, maturation and black fruits almost moldy. The roasted malt is perceived quickly on the palate in the style strong dark Belgian beer. But especially a mouth recalling both the Madeira and Porto. It looks like a bit of a beer that has made ​​the cellar for a few years too. The finish is heavy in this style of ripe red wine which gives it a blood flavor, slightly sweet but it is not the level of beer that quickly reveals itself still disgusting."
"Wonderful belgian dark ale the Nostradamus is! Beautiful dark color and enticing aroma of dark fruit grace the pallete with the beer from brasserie caracole, who alos make saxo, another great beer. When i hear people taling about belgian beers i rarely ever hear this 1 mentioned, which is weird to me because this is 1 of the first belgian beers i tell people about!"
"D. Very drinkable. Can see myself getting this one again."
"Nostradamus pours a light brown toasted color and offers only minimal head. The beer has little to no smell, maybe some maltish tones but I can't really be sure. Nostradamus tastes of Belgian candy syrup, chocolate, toffee and fruits, with raisins and apricots in particular standing out. Lightly carbonated, but not my favorite."
"O: A Nice beer I'll look to get again."
"Poured a reddish brown with a small tan head that recedes to a layer of bubbles. Bready aroma with a cavalcade of dark dried fruits. Taste of caramel and molasses; dark dried fruits: raisins, plums, black cherries. Finishes off with a sugar sweetness and an alcohol bite. Medium mouthfeel, a bit syrupy, but overall very drinkable."
"Overall outstanding, a magnificent Belgian brown."
"This is one I picked up because of the name, and the alcohol content. It's a cloudy brown color with low foam and carbonation. The aroma is a mix of plumb and banana with very noticeable alcohol. The aroma is similar with the alcohol less intense and maybe a hint of nut on top. The taste has a steep crescendo after 7 or 8 seconds. The body is nice and thick and it finishes a tad dry. Overall it has that Belgian sweetness and strength with an added intensity."
"A mildly strange one, this is. Lots of standard sweet and boozy BSDA character up front, but the overarching, various drying notes, coupled with the thoroughly integrated big ABV as things move on, make this more than a tad special. Nice to drink, and even nicer to drink the next, I would venture to guess."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable, delicious and unique Belgian SDA."
"Medium bodied with subtle carbonation, pleasant mouthfeel. Pretty good all around, just a bit different from other Belgian Dark Ales, and worth checking out."
"D: so far so good, but a little sweet and heavy for a session beer"
"Very delicious beer, would pair well with many meals. I found it to go nicely with some beer bread I baked up (package of power + 1 can of beer). Fairly hearty, but also refreshing when at cooler temperatures. The price paid was approximately $13 at the Village Beer Merchant in Buffalo, NY, but after we made the purchase we unfortunately noticed the same beer sold for $8.99 at a Consumers :(. Definitely worth the $9, still glad we got it even with the steep premium."
"I for one am not surprised that it's received very good ratings overall... Gotta love the drawing of Nostradamus as a ""caracole"" :)"
"Wow, I wasn't expecting too much from this, but was really impressed! Looks nice, has a great flavor, and feels wonderful to boot. The flavors aren't too intense or rich, so I think this could work well with food or on its own. Definitely one I'll get again."
"D - Not a bad beer by no means, but do not think I can drink more than one in a session."
"D: A great brew fro, one of the smaller breweries in Belgium. Definitely worth a shot."
"D: As with any good Belgian dubbel/trippel this is no session ale, tho i have no trouble making it through a 33cl bottle. This would serve well as a dessert, with some chocolate or nice brie and preserves."
"Overall a nice brew that I hope to have again. It was tasty. Couldn't drink alot of it all at once though."
"The body is moderate but does leave a lingering sweetness. Almost boarder line under attenuated but not really. Some noticeable fusel notes are a bit of a distraction. Overall some good complexity with the sugar notes and phenolics/esters but some off notes really distract."
"Strong and smooth with a considerably more heavy feel in the mouth than any of the other Caracoles. Makes a good after dinner beer. Liked it enough to pack a bottle home to the states."
"D - This is a perfect example of both complexity and drinkability. I highly recommend giving this a try, but make sure you have plenty on hand because you won't want to stop at one."
"The beer pours a fairly deep brown, without creeping into black territory. There may be a hint of maroon in the color as well, and Nostradamus has faint amber highlights. The head is somewhere between bone and khaki, and a decent roughly two and a half fingers in height. The problem is that retention is below average ofr the style, and and lacing is 100% nonexistent... very disappointing. The nose is a bit weak, and all I can make out are notes of chocolate and some plums and figs. It doesn't smell bad, but I hope there's a bit more to the beer than that. Nostradamus is a bit of an odd duck for a BSDA flavor wise. It's possibly the cleanest tasting beer of the style I've ever tried in that flavors imparted by the yeast are kept to a minimal clove background note. A wonderful bouquet of malty notes provide the lion's share of flavor. There's a very smooth milk chocolate presence, which I guess shouldn't be surprising given that the bottle identifies itself as a Belgian brown ale. There's also the expected sweet dark fruits showing up, noticeably so. Caramel plays more of a background note. There's also a slight warming sensation from alcohol, but Nostradamus stops well short of being boozy. If the chocolate was a little bit less overpowering I'd probably give it a 5, but as is it's just short of perfection. The body is very good, manages not to become to heavy, which is always a concern with such a big, malt forward beer. Carbonation is a bit uneven though, it explodes when it first hits the front of my tongue, but fizzles out quick, so that the beer starts edging into being syrupy by the end of the sip. It's a shame Nostradamus isn't much of a looker, because it's a pretty tasty beer, and a nice changeup from the standard BSDA."
"D: Excellent, well-balanced. Sweet up front but a nicely dry finish and good carbonation to keep it from being cloying. I'm curious if the 750 ml presentation is different than the 330 ml."
"Great presentation in the bottle. Pours a brown ale. head is brown as well. Impressively transparent. very visually appealing. smells of dark candi sugar/ caramel. also aromas of clean smelling yeast. Fermentation is clean tasting. great flavors. easy drinking, smooth beer. I am absolutely amazed by this ABV, so well hidden. great complexities in the sip. balanced out wonderfully. really good brew. I wish I had more."
"D: High. One of my favorites!"
"Maybe I have an off bottle, but the flavor reminds me of bad batches I brewed when I used iodine. The off flavor is overwhelming. The feel is nice, but really, this is a big average beer for me to finish."
"Drinkability: A nice strong beer that doesn't stick to your taste buds like some examples of the style. This one has such a fine finish that it makes every sip heavily anticipated."
"An incredibly well-crafted Strong Dark Belgian, very well put together. Enchanting even. This is one definitely worth seeking out."
"This is excellent. I'm not sure that I want one every night, but the general degree of intellectual engagement in such a beer is amazing. I've never had to think THIS hard about what the hell I'm smelling and tasting. Super-complex, and very rewarding -- definitely in my top five favorite beers of all time..."
"This beer has a nice malty flavour with a sweet raison flavour too. There is a bitter coffee flavour that comes through in the aftertast and the alcohol is noticeable once the rest of the flavour fades away."
"Deep red in body with large off-white head resting on top. Alcohol, prunes, and syrup in the nose. Sugars, alcohol, rock candy, and syrup in the taste. Medium bodied with light carbonation. A sweet drink throughout with some burn from the alcohol. A typical Belgian sugar bomb."
"Don't be afraid to let this beer age. I've had a few vintages from three to four years back, they soured nicely with an intentional flavor. Not accidental at all IMHO."
"D: This had a good scent and taste, but it wasn't super clean or complex. The body was good not great, but the alcohol was well hidden, so it wasn't difficult to drink. An enjoyable beer, but not one of my favorite dark Belgians."
"Thanks to zep9865 for bringin this one over. It poured a dirty, muddied amber with little to no head. The bottle was a little older so had a good amount of chocolate colored sediment. It smelled sweet, yeasty, and malty. It smelled very much like the GI Pere Jacques. The taste too was very, very similar to the Pere Jacques. It had a sweet, almost candied fruit flavor and the alcohol was well hidden. It drank very smoothly and was easy to drink. It was medium bodied and had a nice finish. This was a good, quality Belgian dark."
"On-tap at the Brick Store Pub. Slightly hazy pour, but a very nice dark amber with a very tightly beaded off-white head that leaves some nice lacing. Subtle fruit, spice, and molasses aromas. Quite light in the nose, but well integrated. Tastes of gingerbread, banana, light spices, and molasses, but dry and a little spritzy. Smooth and quite perilously drinkable. Not my absolute favorite Belgian, but a solid choice."
"Nostradamus is similar to Abt 12, but a bit more sweet."
"pours a murky, amber/brown tone with a half finger of off-white head the dissipates quickly, some lacing. smell is sweet; dark fruits, yeast, and spices. first sip is very sweet, with a vague, almost wine-like quality. raisins, plums, malts, spices, and yeast. tasty, yes, but not delicious. moderately carbed with a full mouthfeel. all in all this is a solid beer; i'm enjoying it. that said, IMO there are much better representations of the style."
"The beer pours an orange-amber color with a white head. The aroma is toffee with some earthy hops. The flavor is great. It is a mix of brown sugar, toffee, Begian yeast, alcohol and something resembling oak. The beer is very sweet and the toffee and brown sugar stand out. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"D: The beer is very easy to drink and the alcohol is masked from the smell and taste."
"This one is heavy and alcoholic, but it provides an array of malt flavors perhaps unmatched by any other brew. It is complex but a bit too sweet and alcoholic but overall a solid brew."
"Enjoy!"
"D - I can't help wondering if I got a bad or very old bottle. The first impression of muddy and murky held throughout. This was very disappointing based on the beer and brewery's reputation."
"Drinkability: Wonderfully poised in its respective sensory compartments and thus -- strikingly pleasant."
"d - delicious! i have never even heard of this beer until i saw it in a wine shop that has a great beer selection. i will go to this one again and again."
"highly recommended"
"Overall this is a nice beer but nothing special. Worth a shot."
"Compares very favourably to others with similar style. Definitely worth seeking out though probably quite hard to find (in the UK at least)."
"Pours a wonderfully deep dark black/purple color with some decent head. Wonderful deep malty scent, with a great sweet and fruity tone. Wonderful taste, a hugely deep dark malty flavor with great prune and cherry flavors, along with a nice sugary sweet undertone. Goes down very well for such a thick beer."
"D: Not a great drinkability. This beer is a fabulous sipping beer and pairs extremely well with a cigar. I usually don't smoke a cigar while drinking a beer because some just make the beer taste horrible, but this went quite well."
"This beer goes down very smooth for 9% ABV, but it's still a sipper or one to have as a night cap. It's strong like a barleywine, but still very enjoyable and has a very nice complex flavor which is tasty. A very nice beer that I recommend trying."
"This one is pretty drinkable. It is a good one to finish the night with. I would definitely have this one again."
"Thick bodied, and stiffly carbonated. Silky smooth mouthfeel. Superb drinkability."
"It's rather modest. It could do with some more wild flavours, but all in all a very nice drink."
"Reviewed from my notes. I was served a 6oz pour from a chilled, freshly opened bottle. The beer has a dark copper color. t is translucent and has a thin tan head that dissipated quickly. After a few minutes there was hardly any head left. There is a robust caramel aroma. I am also picking up on some slight pine tones as well. The beer has a sweet flavor, but nothing overwhelming or indicative of the higher ABV. I found this up front malt quality to be very good, but was incredibly impressed with the finish. There is a slightly sour taste in the finish and after taste. It is reminiscent of a Flemish Brown. I found it to be totally unexpected and very tasty. For a strong dark ale, there is a rather light body to this beer. It also has a lot of carbonation, but not enough to distract from the flavor. There are some welcome estery alcohol vapors in my mouth after I swallow. As I seem to find many Belgian beers, this one is very drinkable. I can see the sour aspects being a limiting factor for some drinkers, but personally, I could go for multiple rounds."
"On tap at Kickbacks in Jax. Poured into a Nostradamus tulip. One inch of light beige foam recedes into a thin layer above a hazy brown body. Thin soapy lacing slides down the glass slowly. Aroma is of sweet malts, candi sugar and dark fruits, specifically plum. Taste puts all the associated tastes of this aromas together in a heaping serving of flavor and Belgianny greatness. Hard to believe this is 9.5% ABV. Awesome."
"D: I could have a few of these, very enjoyable."
"Hmmmm...wow. Surprising flavor. Pretty tasty...nice sweetness. A stong fruit flavor, champaigne like feel...and somewhat of a whiskey kick. Some beers hide the booze well, this one feels like a high ABV! Carbonation is medium to high."
"Future outlook: I kept passing this little gem over...night after night in my beer fridge...shame on me. Dare I say, the most enjoyable Belgian strong dark ale that I've personally experienced to date?"
"Overall I really like this beer. I am a huge fan of Brasserie Caracole. I think this is all they things I like in the style of a dubbel turned up a notch. It is a bit cleaner and more falvor full IMHO. If there was such a thing as a dark tripel, I would say this is it. Try this if you can find it."
"Been meaning to try this for a couple of years, glad I got around to it. A nice Belgian Strong Dark Ale, recommended."
"This is a very complex beer that I need to review a second time (oh darn). I really enjoyed this beer but didn't get everything that was imparted into it."
"A complex beer, very port-like and the alcohol is noticeable, at 9.5%, which may make it a good dessert or night cap beer."
"D: Nice example of the style."
"The beer is pleasant to drink, nicely carbonated and goes very well with a strong cheddar I dare say."
"The mouthfeel i a little bit watery for this ABV, but the carbonation feels just right with small smooth bubbles that helps to foam it up nicely with a toungue-swirl or two."
"The carbonation is almost chewable. The flavor sits, oddly, at the carbonation, despite letting the beer sit for some time. 9% ABV not overpowering, but the finish is very dry and very sour."
"An uninspired Belgian brew, alcoholic like a malt liquor."
"But overall: If you get your hands on it, you clearly must buy at least one bottle."
"Conclusion: Unique and interesting, especially in the aroma, where tart red berries and red wine came to mind, as well as almonds and warming alcohol of Calvados. The alcohol and yeast smells get more dominating for each sip and take over. Adequate body with nice CO2 level, but too alcoholic and tart for my taste. Definitely worth tasting for its individuality, but it wont blow your mind."
"D: Me like... a little too strong to really have more than one or two, but definitely an interesting beer."
"Conclusion: This is pretty interesting, kind of like a spiced version of Pommeau de Normandie (a Norman apple cider/Calvados mix). It's esoteric, funky, but a bit over the top for me, a little bit too brash, boozy, and spicy (especially considering the brewery doesn't use spices in this beer) for me."
"It's the bees knees."
"Medium body with very prickly carbonation at first, but soon becomes very smooth. Overall this was very tasty and the initial aroma was very inviting. The alcohol made its presence known right from the start but I don't feel like this detracted from the experience in any way."
"Drinkable is an understatement. I can now understand why this is so hard to come by. This is the ideal bottle to share over dessert, or for the perfect after dinner night-cap."
"Drinkability: Overall this is really nice. The alcohol is a little prominent. Its good, but not fantastic especially since it has to be compared to some of the best beers in the world. There are better choices for the price, but this is pretty widely available, so thats nice."
"D: It's not quite as contemplation-inducing as other BSDAs. It is, however, an outstanding dessert beer. Be warned, though. If you're not big on bananas, stay far away."
"Flavors are layered and with lots of character. The flavors follow the nose - Belgian fruit and malted coffee. Abit short on flavor and character. Not bad at all - just nothing special."
"D) I had very high hopes for this 9% ABV beer, and by high hopes I emphasize high. But the beer fell flat as in flat beer. If it were draft I'd blame the bar but I poured these (plural) from 11.2 ounce bottles. It's good when compared to others, but the Belgians set the bar high."
"Everything you'd want in a Belgian Strong Dark Ale, from a small Belgian brewery."
"Drinkability: Both flavorful and nicely complex, though the alcohol and warming nature of the brew slows my progress to small, thoughtful sips. Thankfully though, the airy carbonation does a fine job in aiding the overall drinkability of this brew."
"MF&D - this is an extremely creamy, velvety beer. the brew is so incredibly mouthcoating, ive never had anything like it before. the brew is a full medium body, but the carbonation pumps it up to a heavy feeling brew, all without bloating me. the carbonation is spectacular, it is abundand and very small scale, which benefits the creaminess of the brew. utterly perfect and enticing, this brew has nailed the feel of a dark strong right on the head. the only problem with the drinkability is that the alcohol might be a bit too pronounced."
"This is by no means a bad beer. I think that I'll need to get ahold of a fresher bottle to give it another stab. But hey, how could I pass up a $6.49 bottle of this stuff?"
"D- Pretty high, one of the most stealth ABVs I've come across yet. Coupled with a solid flavor profile and we have a pretty damn fine beer. I'd certainly buy this again or give as a gift."
"Drinkability? Like I said, I can't do this beer on a hot summer night. It's making me not dread the winter, though. I can't wait to sip this in front of a tv screen with a fireplace video on it and a down comforter on my crummy couch. Winter beer. I can't wait."
"Drinkability when i poured it i thought i was not going to like it and my first sip made me think it was a mistake but going through this beer opened my eyes, although the higher ABV makes it something you would not consume in as high quantitys"
"Notes - Plenty of carbonation with a good mouthfeel. A really good beer, no kidding."
"Pours standarad dark brown into my snifter. Huge initial head that dissipates quickly. Smell is typical belgian sweet candi sugar. Taste... it's like a Belgianized brown ale. Kind of roasty, plenty of malt body, but with some interesting candi sugar, and that Belgian yeast strain that gives it that zestiness. Mouthfeel is just coating enough, not much to comment on. A slight bitterness and alcoholic warming, pleasant. Also a bit nutty. A very interesting Belgian beer."
"Big beer that warms the whole body. Represents the style extremely well. May be a bit strong on the alcohol taste."
"A 330ml bottle poured into my basic snifter glass. The ale appears a deep crimson chestnut color with at least two fingers of foamy, lingering ecru head. A great looking pour. Nose and flavor are of faint alcohol, dried cherries, raisins, prunes, sweet malts, bittersweet chocolate, mild banana notes, quite complex. Bordering on full bodied with ample carbonation. Great drinkability."
"a three finger biscuit brown head easily rises to the top of my glass leaving a wall of lace as it slowly fades. Body is a deep brown murky hue. Nose is super sweet with up front honey, mellon and sunflower like butteriness. With first tip the sweetness is more subdued with a initial up front yeasty nutty feel. there is a substainsial sweetness that runs with a bit of biscuity graham cracker feel. Thick and honey like on the end of the palate. mouthfeel has a slight bitter feel and some mineral notes are there. Nice carbonation throughout. Drinkability is solid."
"Smells like a Belgian ale... a little bit of fruit and the alcohol presence is there. The taste is more of the same... the alcohol comes through pretty strong in this one. Very well balanced, a quite nice brown ale."
"Appearance wasn't too impressive as far as carbonation is concerned. It did however have a nice dark brown color with chunky bits of yeast floating around. Very complex aroma hinting at cherries, hops, strong malt notes, and copper. Aroma became more complex as it warmed and got some air. The potent mouthfeel and finish seems to overpower the taste. Raisins and plums are hinted in the taste. Strong Carbonation coupled with a high ABV and strong phenol bitterness seem to hide any real flavors. Very rich malty and dry finish with a strong lingering bitterness. No brew for rookies, but worth a try. Bottle lists this as a Artisanal Belgian Speical Brown Ale"
"Overall: The mouth feel is creamy and lightly carbonated. The body of the beer is medium and the finish is light. This beer to me is a bit flat. The flavor are delicate and with a very nice rich malty goodness. The beer to me doesn't stand out for a great Belgium Dark Ale, but it is descent."
"D - Dry but quite complex. This is a beer to savor rather than quaff. Had 750 ml which was as much as I would want in a single serving."
"This is a well made brew, although there are many other beers in it's catagory whose taste I prefer over this one."
"This beer has a lot of head I would even say to the point that it is excessive. It is a frothy huge bubbly head. Even with all this head there is not much for carbonation in the body. It smells sweet and very fruity. It is more like a wine than a beer in the aroma. It tastes a lot like a wine too. It sort of reminds me of lambrusco (I am not sure if that is spelled right. That is why I am not on wine advocate.) It has a great woody aftertaste. The only hops I noticed were in the aftertaste. It has a little bit of liquor like tone but for the most part it is smooth."
"A very good Belgian brown!"
"This is a drinkable dark that's not a fruity as I expected. The alcohol is not subtle at all."
"Beer poured brown with a huge tan head that is hanging around quite nicely. Nose is big malt with hints of alcohol and fruityness. Taste is good but not overly complex, dark fruits and big malts dominate with a slightly dry phenolic finish. Mouthfeel is quite wonderful, very smooth as it glides across the palate. Overall drinkability is good. The abv is very well masked. Quite the delicious beer. Definitely one to try if you like the style."
"Mouthfeel: Not as carbonated as it initially appears. Medium bodied and just enough carbonation. Very pleasant."
"D = Very easy drinker. SweetnessABV a little strong to be a session, but could work through 2 or 3 easily."
"M - Substantial, sort of chewy yet no thicker than medium bodied."
"This is definitely an excellent beer in my opinion, but I would drink a Corsendonk Brown Ale before this one, if I had the choice."
"This beer is pretty easy drinking, I shared it with another and definitely could have split another bottle or two."
""
"I want to preface this by saying Brown Ales are not my favorites. This one is really good. It pours a nice brown with a bit of orange, almost no head and a tad on the cloudy side. The smell is nice, fruity with a hint of toffee. The toffee comes out stronger in the taste. Front end is toffee and dark fruit, back end nicely highlights malt and the same dark fruits. It is surprisingly sweet and mild considering the 9% alcohol. In my humble opinion, this is a very good beer."
"Very nice beer. I've also had this on tap and recall it tasting just as good, maybe even better."
"Got a bottle for $8.50 at Abe's Cold Beer. This reminded me a bit of the dark Unibroue's for the rich grape and date flavor. This beer drinks a little thinner, however, with a mellow, earthy/dirty spice aftertaste. It is on the sweet side, but it's fairly balanced and reasonably drinkable for the strength. The aroma was a touch weak, but still full of those pleasant fruit and herbal elements. I'd say this one is worth a try."
"This one is great for sipping and savoring, much as a tawny port. Drinkability is high for what it is - it goes down smoothly and the alcohol only rears its head subtly, which I absolutely love. This is one solid brew... an excellent example of the style, and definitely worth sampling."
"Cloudy chestnut with a big fluffy sand colored head that leaves beautiful sticky lace rings on the glass. Smells complex, notes of toffee, plum and lemon. Taste is also complex, raisins & cocoa with a tea-like bitterness in the finish. Gets real nice as it warms up, alcohol is very well hidden for such a powerful brew. Medium bodied and highly carbonated. Highly drinkable."
"Pours a hazy brown color with some suspended yeast. 1/3 inch head of a maize color. Decent retention and decent lacing. Smells of tart malt strongly, then sweet malt and some slight fruit aromas underneath. Fits the style of a Belgian Strong Dark Ale. Mouth feel is smooth and crisp with high carbonation level. Taste strongly of tart malt up front, a general dryness throughout the brew, and some sweet malt in the finish."
"D - Finally, a brown ale I can embrace. This is definitely not your typical ho-hum brown ale. Instead, I was treated to a smooth, complex brew that drank exceptionally well for a 9.5% ABV beer. Very nicely done!"
"Overall: Great, if ever-so-slightly sweet. Very vinous. This stuff is perfect with Chicken Marsala, and even better with spicy Senegalese peanut soup!!"
"Please, try this with a strong cheese. I tried with Gorgonzola and could not get enough. The competition of the sweet ale and pungent cheese cause a reaction a chemist could not explain. Only something I or Nostradamus could have predicted."
"Pours a smallish tan head on top of a leather brown body. Smell comprised of dark fruits, figs, little citric hop notes and very mild roasted and sweet malts. A complex smell. A medium-bodied beer that made my face turn sour for a second, but then the beer flowed over my tongue smooth and a little creamy. Even finished sweet. A fruity taste along with sweetness with citric notes and touches of heavier fruits. Slightly dry hopping along with spices balance the beer out and complement its finish, although they're might just a touch of alkie burn. A great beer to slowly sip and enjoy."
"Exceptionally light on the tongue, and a bit malty sweet, with crisp mouthfeel, this is a really easy drinking beer, but at 9.5%, not a sessioner."
"Terrific."
"Poured this reddish brown beer into a pint glass. This belgian beer has brownish debree within the unfiltered beer. The foam that it presented was white in coloration. While it leaves a very thin laving. THe aroma that greets the nose is that of spiced fruit and caramel. While the taste matched it it also gave tones of the malts alcohol."
"Drinkability is good for a beer of its strength. I had a small bottle after another 6% beer and that was enough. Would make a good nightcap or after dinner beer"
"Drinkability : a good beer in the style Belgian strong dark ale."
"D: A fine Belgian Strong, worth of admiration and respect. All too drinkable, yet potent enough to be a once-only beer (or at least an end-of-night, sweet-dreams beer). Caracole has got a winner with this one; highly recommended."
"As the last beer of the night, this is a great caper. Served in a brewer-specific over-sized flute glass it looked opaque in the dimly lit venue, head was a finger of tiny white bubbles. The smell was not of beer but the smell of the season. This is an autumn beer. The name is appropriate because this is a contemplative beer; one to have while pondering and awaiting visions of the future. The taste was a pleasing blend of dark fruits. Raisin, plum, apple all have subtle presence here. For a strong beer this one is absolutely drinkable."
"D: Very good. It was hard to get more than a brief hint of alcohol but by the end of the bottle I was feeling it in my cheeks."
"Taste is light bitter with a nice candisugar, caramel taste. Some alcoholic whiffs. A spicy taste that appear to be coriander and clove, or at least that's how it tastes. A nice rounding maltbitterness. To me a pretty standard Belgian beer, but that doesn't make it any less."
"Drinkability is good. I'd have loved to have drank the whole bomber by myself but I shared it with a friend. Easy going down considering the ABV."
"This beer is not really my gig, but I could see this being better with food...flavorful food like gorgonzola or a pepper crusted T-bone."
"Smooth with fine carbonation, Nostradamus is extremely drinkable, and holding true to the drink's namesake, I predict that I'll buy another the next time I see it!"
"The aroma is spicy alcohol with some dark fruit. The taste is malty sweet and finishes fruity. In the mouth it is a tad chewy but you do not get any alcohol burn, which is nice. You get a brown sugar smell as well. The spice & fruit linger on the tongue. Overall a very enjoyable BSDA."
"D-This beer is dangerously smooth for the ABV. The amount of alcohol is barely detectable."
"Pours a deep, rich mahogony color with a nice creamy, tan head. It has great lace and good retention. The nose is heavily of candi sugar and dark fruits. The taste follows the smell but is more complex. Plums and cherries are very apparent long with carmelized sugar and roasted malt. Medium to full body. Great beer...highly recommended"
"Overall, a beer that is too sweet to be anything more than a one-time sipper. Not offensive, but not what a Belgian Dark Ale should be, I think."
"Poured into a tulip, this beer was a beautiful brown with a tinge of orange. A two-finger tan head adorned the crown and proved resiliant after settling down a bit. Smells delicious - rum, sugar, apples, raisens, melons, and a bit of bread. Very well balanced flavor - begins with raisins and mildly sweet rum then goes to apples and finishes with a small hop bite and some toasty bread. Medium body and just a bit sticky on the tongue. Fantastic brew!"
"Pours a redish brown color. This beer is on the sweet side andsmells and tastes of malt, raisins and some plum flavor. The drinkability is high considering the abv. A little pricey but certainly worth trying at least once."
"Poured into a stemmed tulip yields ample off-white foam over a lovely caramel colored body. Fruity & alcoholic nose with strong apple and raisin aromas..faint bready tones underneath. Flavor is initially sharp as you are greeted by the ample zesty carbonation and then the fruity flavors promised in the aroma. Apples, pear, fig & raisins over a light sweet malty base. Subtle peppery spice, alcohol & faint yeast round out the experience as it finishes plenty dry and warming. As the glass warms, the malt begins to sweeten the flavor and firm up the body adding another dimension to the brew. Overall a very nice beer with plenty of flavor though out the glass."
"Aroma and taste were both rich. Treacle sweet in both also. Would have liked more body for a 9.5% beer. Interesting enough, but without the 'umph factor' for me."
"Poured into chalice. Pours a suprising ruby-brown color. Much more red than expected, a thick, creamy, off-white head with great retention and lacing. Smell I did like so much. I found it to be way too strong of alcohol, some bread and yeast, but mainly alcohol. Taste I did love though, I think this is the first beer I've had where I genuinely dislike the smell but love the taste. Wonderfully complex, fruity (apples inparticular), malty, sweet, a kiss of alochol, it was great. Mouthfeel is light due to a moderatly high carbonation. Overall a very good beer."
"D: At 9.50% you cant exactly call this guy a session beer, but one of these with dinner doesnt hurt anything"
"Not an all-rounder, but an example for it’s style"
"Bordering on rich, this is a nice example of some characteristics I prefer in the style (dark fruit and rich malt balanced with yeast strain). Fairly well done with most high points very well hit. Abv detracts some, but I still think it's rather drinkable."
"Had this on draft at the Mellow Mushroom in Delray Beach, FL. Pours an amber rustic orage with a minimal head, but does keep a ring around and nice lacing on the glass. Smell is of fresh figged fruit with a slight hint of banana. Taste is pretty amazing with a bready fruity sweet taste, overall an awesome brew and a pleasure to have this on draft."
"Pours a clear translucent red hued amber color with a shallow fizzy light tan head that fades quickly, leaving a spotty pattern of lacing. The smell is an earthy light fig malt. Brightly carbonated, giving the mouth feel a lighter texture. The 9.5% ABV is really well hidden in the taste, but there is some heat on the way down. Really quite drinkable. The earthy fig flavor is lighter than i'd expect from this style, yet it lingers nicely after the swallow. Really glad that i had the opportunity to consider this one."
"Pours a cloudy reddish brown. Nose is sweet with alcohol, malt, and banana Alcohol and sweetness, yeast and some nice slightly exotic fruit notes. Cherries, honey, banana and spice in taste. Very smooth mouthfeel and bitter sweet finish. Pretty good."
"Pours a slightly cloudy dark amber and caramel color with plumes of dense, meringue like tan head. Aromas are quite fruity, more dubbel like than BSDA. Lots of raisin, caramel, plum, along with quite a bit of spiciness. On the palate, really quite a bit more of the same with a thick rum raisin like character really coating the tongue. The finish is a touch too sweet IMO but nowhere near cloying. It is certainly a rich malt bomb with a spicy finish. Overall, a pleasant drinker, but not as memorable as Saxo."
"This beer pours a cloudy darker amber color with a large amount of head. Head takes a little while to dissipate. Taste most strongly of nuts with noticable effects of the alcohol. Very easy to drink with a great mouthfeel, this was one enjoyable beer. I would recommend and purchase again."
"Drinkability is good, but the ABV keeps this one a sipper. Still, I could enjoy a couple of these."
"This beer pours a cloudy brown-amber color. The head is one inch in height, and recedes into a small cap of lacing. The aroma is of caramel, dates, anise, and brown sugar. The taste is soft and strong. Anise, dates, brown sugar, molasses, and black licorice. The mouthfeel is full bodied with a silky texture, and fine carbonation. Overall, this is a very good Belgian Strong Ale. I could easily drink this again."
"just reeling, the aromas are profoundly fruity and the chocolate nuances are very un-roasted in character. lots of rich ripe flavors, a truly different beer, worth checking out. loved it."
"Good stuff, but I have had a lot better. Beautiful color, but not much of a head.Smooth on the palate, with a warm alcohol feeling at the end. Caramel and sweetness come to mind. Nice lace at the end. One can do better and a lot worse. Unfortunately, it is not one of those beers that bring you down on your knees."
"D: Very good, extremely smooth and tasty on the swallow and one definitely worth trying. A great complexity and layering of flavors makes this an incredibly drink."
"D: This is an extremely drinkable beer. Zesty, complex, smooth and not at all bitter."
"Overall, this was a very good belgian brown ale and will pick it up again."
"Drinkability - not one to pound, this should be sipped and savored like a good red wine. Seems to share some of the tasting notes of a pinot noir. A worthy choice."
"To call this beer drinkable is to undersell the definition of drinkable. I drink Nostradamus fairly often; I think it is a great beer at a great price. I was surprised to see I had not reviewed it (okay, I wasn't... I've slacked off reviewing beers quite a lot. Anyway...) so I finally sat down and put my thoughts down on this fine Belgian beer. In sum, Nostradamus is a damn good beer that I have no issues of recommending to somebody looking for a dark, malty Belgian ale with good complexity"
"Not a good encounter with this brew."
"D: Almost too drinkable. There aren't many beers I can slam down like this. Only after all the beer is gone do I notice the buzz that I've acquired."
"Easy to sip and savor, but the heavy alchohol content offers a recommendation for a full stomach! Maybe I was tired but a chalice full of this really kicked my @$$ a bit. A pleasurable beating, but wow - powerful and very enjoyable stuff. I look forward to finishing the rest of the 750 (capped with a wine stopper) very soon (after dinner, that is)."
"Sweetness and alcohol slow it down, but a smoothness and nice taste make it quite drinkable. Nice complexity. A nice BSDA to sip on!"
"Yum."
"Copped a 750 ML bottle from Gary's in Madison for about $7.99..."
"Drinkability is questionable for me. Just SO strong on the alcohol front. Perhaps good for the end of an evening. This is not a ""session"" beer anyway. But, if you are sitting around with some friends, trying out some GREAT beers, this is certainly one of them."
"D: A very good beer from Caracole, easy to drink, even at 9%, they certainly know what they're doing."
"Pretty full body, smooth and palate-coating, soft carbonation. Impressive. Not quite easy drinking, but I went through it pretty fast - too fast for 9.5%. I suppose my only ""complaint"" is it'd be hard to drink a less flavor-filled beverage after this. Oh well, hand me another of these!"
" Body is nice and full, but not sticky. The ample carbonation can be a bit foamy without proper care. This is a highly drinkable beer, especially given its high alcohol content. Perhaps this is one to be careful with, as it does not give many clues to its potency. Drink up, and take care."
"It's a happy Belgian that stands a few steps above the standard issue. It's reasonably complex, well blended, and pleasurable to drink. And despite an ABV that speaks loud and clear, it goes down with a smooth and enjoyable way about it. It may not jump out, but I'm predicting that in the future I'll be seeing more of Nostradamus."
"Poured on tap at pizza port carlsbad 12-30-07 at $5 a 12 oz glass. Poured a brownish clay color with a white head. Smell is green apples with sourness and a slight vingear smell. Taste is tart with sweetness of orchaids fruit, a definte belgian influence on the thick dark fruit maltiness. Mouthfeel is full and lush with a smooth carbonation. While a good beer, its strong flavor and warm alcohol feel, it is really sipping beer."
"D: This beer is pretty strong so the drinkability suffers a little. Nevertheless, it masks the 9% ABV very well and is a pleasant spicy brew to sip. Another great beer from Caracole."
"D - This is a very nice Belgian beer. Maybe a little pricey, but still very good."
"A good example of a Belgian Strong Dark Ale. Not among the best, but definitely a nice beer."
"Taste/mouthfeel: Caramel malts and spices come out first, followed by a pleasant ripe fruitiness. The finish is overly hot and boozy, making me think that this beer would be much nicer with some age. Overall a good beer, definitely appropriate for the season. I'd be interested in trying a bottle that has been cellared for a year or so."
"Damn, I tried to drink this while it was cold...not a good idea. This brew is a deep amber with shades of brown and red. A nice head that retains well and leaves spotty lacing. Smell is floral, spicy, and fruity. Alcohol scent comes across more like a wine than anything. Taste has hints of caramel and spices, with a big apple cider flavor to it. Pears and even grape come through. Again, reminds me of wine. Mouthfeel is somewhat creamy and full. Definitely slick on the tongue. Decent drinkability. This beer definitely needs to warm up before consuming. The proper temperature will bring out the best here, otherwise you might get the wrong idea."
"Good interesting beer."
"D--good, not outstanding, if you are a Belgian lover, worth a try."
"Overall, a good beer, but pretty standard. Very well made, and definately worth a try."
"D: A heavy drink, only one a night. A good capper, but I'll bet it would really benefit from some age."
"This beer poured a dark amber that was cloudy with yeast. The head was foamy and short lived but subsided to excellent lacing. The smell was mild but carried yeast and alcohol aromas. The flavor was yeasty with dark fruits like cherries and currants, slightly tart and with a little alcohol flavor mixed in. Overall I enjoyed this beer but found it to be more or less an average Belgian dark ale."
"good tasting brew: fruity with a hint of sour. robust bready flavors. lots of dried fruits. i'm enjoying this beer"
"Mouthfeel is medium-full bodied, estery, cocoa infusion that fades nicely into the deluxe smoothness of this beer. At 9.5%, I hardly noticed it."
"Go find yourself some, unique stuff."
"Pair it with your favorite fruit pie."
"D - A very tasty brown belgian ale, but more than a bit strong (9%) and is filling so it is less than great in the drinkability. It has many layers and is complex in intensity, though."
"D - A little too sickly sweet for more than one, and the alcohol content could be a problem. This is an outstanding sipping beer, and it's just about perfect as an accompaniment to dark chocolate. I'm impressed. This is bottled candy."
"Pours amber color with creamy off white head. Smell is of dark fruit, and slight alcohol. Taste is slightly high in some warming alcohol characteristics, as well as some dark fruits, and esters, I can pick out green apple. Highly carbonated beer that makes this a quick, and tasty drink. I notice my glass is empty again. Very enjoyable, and kind of reminded me of a Chimay."
"Moderate carbonation and some dryness. Smooth and clean throughout. Pleasant and well received with lots of character. Nicely different."
"Great pour- the amber-brown brew created an amazing cloudy head that took minutes to dissipate. Huge fruity aromas- dried fruits, raisins, acidic plums, candy sweetness. Very malty on the first sip and so on- though the high carbonaton really slices the thickness up and makes it light and airy. I would like a little more balance, but the flavors are there for the most part. The is a slight warming alcohol burn, and a sour flash at the very end and a surprising creaminess to the finish. Good brew."
"Pours rich reddish brown with thick, bubbly, tan head. Very active carbonation shown by many small bubbles moving through the liquid. The head dissipates slowly, eventually forming just a thin film after drinking for a while. The smell is complex, moderately malty with nutty and bread influences and a hint of brown sugar or caramel. Yeast is also apparent that is somewhat earthy, and there is a delayed truffle aroma. Very interesting. The taste is fairly sweet malt with some sourness and a hint of the earthiness noted in the aroma. The aftertaste picks up a little bitterness and enforces the earthy malt of the IF. TTh aftertaste is relatively long-lived and finishes up a little sour. The mouth feel is medium bodied and a little chewy with active to fizzy carbonation, giving a little bite on the tongue. The finish is moderately alcoholic. This is a tasty, complex belgium beer that goes great with game such as wild boar of venison. Also nice with a slice of artisan bread such as volkornbrot or pumpernickel. It was a little sweet for my taste, especially as it warmed a few degrees beyond the recommended 55 degrees F. I would definitely buy it again, especially for some interesting food pairings or for dessert."
" Adam"
"Wonderful sipping beer. Very full flavored and complex. It was a joy to be sitting with a tulip glass full of the beer. Can't wait to have it again sometime."
"An altogether excellent beer."
"Solid and complex brew, but not quite top echelon Strong Dark."
"Poured this milk chocolate colored brew from a 750ml corked bottle. It has a dense tan head that dissipates down to a bubble thin layer with a couple islands of thicker head. Aroma is sweet and tart at the same time with an alcoholic kick maybe a little chocolate and cherry too. There is a leathery cherry flavor intermixed with bitterness that seems more like citric acid than hops and the alcohol could use to be masked better. Beer seems thin for a the alcohol content."
"I love the artwork on the label - it is a hoot!"
"Cheers."
"Quite good, I would certainly drink again."
"Overall, not a bad brew, but there are far more superior choices out there, esp. among Belgians."
"Tangy, woodsy, vinegary malt notes up front, soon complemented by dark fruits, sweet candy sugar, and rummy alcohol. Tangy-ness sticks around through the otherwise malty finish. This strong dark ale has some nice oud brown qualities (vinegar tang, wood) mixed with fruity, yeasty, fruit cake malty sweet Quad qualities. Nice. Full-bodied, with pinpricks of rolling, tickly carbonation. Dangerously drinkable, too!"
"It's about as drinkable as any other BSDA (not very), but it's an oustanding example of the style. Very similar to Gouden Carolus Cuvée van der Keizer/Grand Cru of the Emperor in pretty much every aspect."
"The perfect Belgian Strong Dark Ale? Perhaps..."
"Poured from a 22oz corked bottle. Pours a deep hazy brown with a small head with some good lacing. Smell is strong of sweet pears, almost like a dessert wine. Taste is very good. A good amount of sweet carries over from the smell. Tastes of pears with some good malt character and some lingering bitterness. Taste is not as sweet as you'd expect from the smell. Not too complex but very good, a nice dry finish. Mouthfeel betrays a bit of the alcohol content, but otherwise good. Drinkability is high, a very good brew. I'd definitely buy this again if I was looking for a good 22oz belgian."
"Can't rate this high on drinkability either cause of the high%abv."
"750ml corked and caged bottle with a best before date of 6/08. pours a medium brown with a small quik fading head and minimal lace. Aromas of rich malt, brown sugar, sherry and dried fruits. Lots of nice flavors here - similar to the aromas. Very low carbonation though which surprised me - too low I think. This beer is tasty but the extreme low carbonation kind of throws it off. Perhaps I just got a bad bottle?"
"D - The drinkability is good, however due to the high abv, one is enough."
"This beer poured a cloudy brown with a cream colored head  some lacing. The smell is strong of caramel and malt  filled me with anticipation. The taste is bold and maltyalso a little sour and fruity. The mouthfeel is very full, but not chewy. This is a very delicious beer, I find it quite drinkable and highly recommend it!"
"This pours with a very robust head from the bottle into my Duvel tulip glass. A beautiful brownish, copperish, redish appearance. Lace bubbles up aggresively during the pour but settles nicely leaving patches of lace on the glass. This is an aromatic Belgian...something that's been lacking in some of the stuff I've recently reviewed both Belgian and otherwise. Strong notes of candied sugar, ripe pears, orange peals, raisens, and dates even. Yes, finally an aggressive brew and not just from an alcohol perspective. More ripe fruit in the taste. You really can perceive the candied sugar. Nice, full mouthfeel. Slightly bicuity. Chewy but not overly so. This brew just embraces your palette. It's sweet and then migrates its way down and the alcohol presents itself; it's light but oh so nice. I'm a virgin to this brew no more and will make an effort to seek it out again. Can't wait to try it on tap should it ever appear in my area or somewhere during my travels. Make a point to grab this at your next opportunity."
"and still it refreshes!"
"Poured beer from bottle to a tumbler at 45 dgrees. Beer was a cloudy brown most likely too cold. Beer had a bready smell and a slight hop smell. big fat tan head with fine bubbles and great lacing. Beer was ver Abbeyish tasting and the alcohol just was way too overpowering blowing away any taste sensation. I will not buy again."
"Highly recommended."
"Dark ruby with a smaller than expected head and minimal retention. Even swirling brings out little head, its best appearance characteristic is in its color. Very fruity, mild citrus in the smell with a touch of darker spices. Incredibly smooth and fruity in the flavor. Fruitiness and smooth taste make it quite drinkable. A bit less complex than I had expected, but damn good."
"One of my favorite Belgium Brown ales."
"Into a tulip glass, pours a dark and heady russet brown, moderate carbonation on pour, with a nice off white foma on top settling down to a thin bubbly film in the center, ringed around the edges, and the rest a wispy film over the brown goodness. Aroma is rich, full of dark fruits, figs, plums, mollases, some cherries, some brandy, everything well put together, very nice. Taste is similar to the nose, a lot of fruits, plum and brandy seem to stand out, cherries in there, a wonderful balance of all things tasty. The mouth has the right body, the right carbonation, it warms nicely, its fantastic, I love it. This is pretty much what I think of when I reach for a Belgian Strong Dark, very high quality beer, and an excellent find on my part, on sale at Cellar's for an $8 four pack, I'm stoked cause I have three left, yesss!!!!"
"Drinkability: The flavor is very pleasant and complex."
"Overall: A very good strong dark ale, though Ive had better. Definitely better when warmed. Good call."
"Got a 750mL bottle for Chistmas. Great head when poured which dissipates into nice thin layer. Deep copper color, just a bit cloudy. Has a fruity smell and a bit of a liquorice taste. Let it warm to proper temperature before tasting. A strong beer... be careful."
"Drinks alright to good, this is a good, not great Belgian brown that maybe could've stood some more aging"
"11.2 ouncer purchased at Cable Bev. in Bardonia, NY. No freshness info offered. This little beauty pours muddy dark brown, cloudy, under a typical medium tan head, that seems to leave moderate scattered lacing. Sugary, raisiny nose. Nice drinking brown Belgian, notes of sweet, rummy raisins, dark fruits and drying hops late. Pleasant, fruity, plummy, doughy ale. alcohol well hidden. NIce stuff, well worth a try or two."
"Pours a deep cloudy brown with slight garnet hue. I poured this too agressively but head reduced to good lacing. Smell of brandied cherries and spice. Taste much the same with a pleasant bitterness on the sides of the tongue in the aftertaste. We buy this less often than other Belgian brown ales however it is a great brew we'll keep in rotation."
"D: Tasty, goes down easy, not very filling, ABV is well-hidden, overall its a very good beer, but it normally wouldnt be my first choice."
"I chilled it to 50 deg F, and drank it from a Leffe glass. It poured a deep red, with some foam but not too much. It has a rich mouthfeel, and an aroma of spices. Very sweet. For me, one of the best Brune beers."
"330 mL bottle, best by 06/08, brewed with specialty and roasted malts, spiced with Saaz, bottled unfiltered and unpasteurized. It pours a yeast-laden dark rust with light carbonation and a three finger, fluffy, almond head that leaves nice lacing. It smells of rich malts/grains, with dark fruits, various berries (raspberry, redcurrant, strawberry?, kiwi?), and maybe some port. The flavor starts off rich and malty (molasses, carob?, light chocolate), but also quite sweet, with notes of roasted malts, pear/melon, apple?, fennel/anise, powdery/spicy yeast, clove/medicinal phenols, and a small dose of green hops that deliver a mild bitterness. The body, though tingly, is medium to full, dry, and leaves a medium finish. Overall, a complex, malty beer that starts off rich but becomes sweet and fruity. Would definitely revisit."
"Another beer that I've been putting off for a while, more due to no being sure how good it would really be. Now that I've tried it, I wish I had several more bottles for future consumption. A very nice before bedtime beer."
"D - I wouldn't seek it out, but it's not bad. Glad I tried it."
"Very drinkable, but the question is do you want to drink an entire one of these? A glass is worth having, and definitely a nice warmer on a cold autumn night, but there are better choices in the genre."
"Drinkability: This is one fine brew to savor. The flavor is very pleasantly complex. Just when you think you have a grasp on a flavor , it morphs into another , brilliant!"
"BBE 6-2006. Poors out almost without any head and what was there gone in a second and a brown and clear beer under it. Nose is lots of caramel, port, sweetish and obvious this one has some time on it despite having it in my fridge for almost a year and carefull storage in my cellar before. Not 100%shure but would say this one shows quiet some tomatojuice/sweet corn. Taste also very oxidised and with that sweet caramel and malts next to the warming alcohol. Not a bad brew for shure but missing sparkling freshness and IMHO not a great brew to age despite the 9.5% ABV."
"On tap at Zeno's in State College. The pour into a half pint goblet raised no head, but rather a light tan glass ring. The body appeared as a dark ruby-copper, slightly hazy. It left sparse but sticky lacing on the glass. The nose wass not complicated, but quite nice. Notes of earth, caramel, and pepper. The taste almost felt oak-aged, with strong vanilla notes. There was also a strong caramel taste. Plain, but very easy, hid the alcohol well. Intense and rich, for what it is. The mouthfeel was medium, with low carbonation, lending the beer a velvety smoothness. Overall, this is an easy but great beer."
"edit: 33cl bottle serving, noted an odd medicinal note that stuck around, even after sitting in the glass for awhile. Could be an old bottle...picked up a 4-pack, hope this isn't a trend."
"-Oelergud"
"Excellent beer, like all of the Caracole offerings."
"Really nice offering from Caracole, much more enjoyable than Saxo."
"Would drink again, however not at 10 am and would pair it with fruit and cheeses. Good beer to try if new to Belgium style beers."
"A belgian worth trying a second, or third time."
"Drinkability: Meh. Smells great, average flavor, bit too boozy overall."
"This would make a nice after dinner sipping ale. The sweetness in the aftertaste is the biggest drawback. Could have probably used a bit more Belgian spices (pepper or coriander), maybe even a small addition of bittering hops. The cork gave this ale a nice cellar earthiness that I liked."
"This is a pretty drinkable beer and I will definately by picking up some more of this one."
"A one-off Belgian brown living up to it's namesake. Certainly worth a try and a well crafted beer in every sense."
"drinkability: pretty good"
"Drinkability - this is good, and goes down well. High abv limits the sessionability."
"This strikes me as a beer which could be very variable in production as well as aging. I felt like it should have been better, but it was just a little lacking in complexity. A very nice Strong Dark regardless, definitely worth a try."
"This poured much like any other Belgian. About 20/80% beer/foam with an enormous foamy head that extended downward through much of the glass leaving only about 25mm of beer. After the foam collected to a much nicer looking 4cm or so, the beer appeared a cloudy brownish red colour. The khaki colour foam left nice, sticky lacing on the sides of my glass. The smell was classic Belgian: a bit of raisins, candied fruit, and alcohol; generous amounts of each. Almost reminded me of a tripel, only I don't care for most tripels, and I am really enjoying this. Taste was quite malty, plenty of candied fruit in the middle, and then a punch in the face with alcohol burn. It wasn't unpleasant, just strong. It is what you might expect a 9.5% Belgian to be. The mouthfeel was magnificent. Silky smooth with zero carbonation sting. Very pleasant to drink. So far, I have savoured each sip, rolling it around in my mought before I swallow it. In fact, this has the greatest mouthfeel I have had in a beer in at least 6 months. I am quite impressed with this, and will certainly buy it again. Smashing!!"
"Quite drinkable for 9.5%. Very clean aftertaste, just watch out for the carbonation - it can bubble up on you."
"Pours a cloudy brown, with an amazing aroma of warming alcohol, fruity, with hints of berries, plum, and pear. Very sweet. Rich & warming in the mouth. With a taste of liquorice, mocha, pear, toasted bready flavor. Malt also comes through and finishes dry and sweet. A great after dinner sipper."
"This beer poured a dark amber color into my Duvel tulip with a large 2 finger head that took a while to subside. Aroma was malty and spicy with a little bit of a wine aroma. Taste was a mix of malty sweetness, ripe fruit, hoppy bitterness and a sour/winey flavor in the finish. This beer is medium to full bodied and with it's hefty alcohol punch really hit the spot on a cool and cloudy mid-Spring evening. Well worth it for a $5.99 750 ml bottle."
"Overall: An interesting juxtaposition between the aroma and flavor. The aroma was not at all what I was expecting going into it and then the flavor was not at all what the aroma led me to believe it might be. Some of the flavor combinations are reminescent of some colas."
"This beer poured into my Chimay chalice a nice dark brown. There was a thin head with good retention. The most notable thing about the smell is the immediate alcohol presence. The taste is brown sugar, molasses and there is a deffinate alcohol presence as well. The mouthfeel is dominated by the alcohol notes. This beer lacks a smoothness to be very drinkable. A potent brew."
"From a bottle brought to our beer club...dark and crimson colored. white head. lots of yeast and sediment floating around. smells pretty fucking terrible. really peaty and very sweet. alcohol and malt and syrupy caramel taste. i really think this bottle may have been skunked or something. ive heard this is a good beer but i don't even want it in my glass. not even a sipping beer. Brett: AW! this tastes like BLOOD!"
"Drinkability- Very tasty and flavorful. Nice dark fruit mixture. Worth seeking out and trying."
"The pour left large amounts of head. The color was deep reddish brown with hints of purple. A strong fruity smell with raisons and malt were present. This beer tasted of raison and malt with hints of butterscotch. This beer had a smooth finish! Overall an excellent beer!"
"It's a great beer! But I recommend drinking it fairly quickly!"
"Mouthfeel is chewy and silky. Nice level of carbonation to scrub the tongue, and flavor lingers well. Drinkability is good given the alcohol pecentage."
"It's warming and relaxing. Not that it's bad, but I couldn't have a lot of these cause they'd just put me to sleep eventually."
"The mouth is a great reflection of the nose. Starts with a smooth combination of sweet fruit, caramel, and big, sweet yeast. That gets just a little zippy in the middle, as the mellow fruit takes on some citrus nodes, and then it slams you in the back of the throat near the end with a huge rush of wonderful alcohol. Leaves a nice, dry sweetness lingering about."
"Color is a deep mahogany, very cloudy, with only a slim head. The smell is strong with notes of rasin, dark fruit, belgian yeast, and sugary cinnamon. It tastes like chocolate and dark fruit, with a cinnamon raisin sweet funkiness. Not all that alcoholic for 9.5%. Carbonation is medium, thickness medium. Very drinkable with its hidden alcohol and sweet flavors."
"Pours out with a weak head that falls into almost nothing. Color is a beautiful brown that looks tasty. Smell is inviting, very fruity with the malty sugar flavor. Taste is a little less flowery than the smell and it still keeps it's complexities. It's a good flavor, very good. It has dark fruit flavors with bittersweet hops."
"Damn good beer. I'll probably drink it more often if and when I decide to drink more belgian beer. In the meantime, I'm slowly clearing some of these bottles out of my makeshift cellar."
"Porty and equal in complexity to a nice glass of porto. Dark, hazy plum-brown, barley wine like color. Large crown, short retention, little to no lacing. Nose is dominated strongly by dark caramels and toffees. Rum soaked dark fruits and banana come through in the end. Taste is a blend of rum and port. Oak is present adding a slight bourbon quality, but over all the dark fruits shine through bestmainly figs. More carbonated than most BSDAs. Medium body that improves greatly as the beer warms. (It seemed a bit thin at first but that went away as some of the carbonation settled out and the beer warmed). Very, very drinkable."
"Boy is this one bad mofo! It pours dark brown. What a head very thick and with a refreshing khaki/tannish in color... As I drink this down it leaves a nice lacing on my glass. You get a big whiff of sweetness/malt followed by fruits and alcohol from this brew. I really like the taste which is sweet molasses sugary on top with some fruityness hidden below. I don't know how the hell they hide that 9.5 ABV but it certainly contributes to a pleasant mouthfeel and overall drinkability. This one WILL sneak up on you. I will pick this on up again for sure."
"Despite the high ABV, this goes down easily and is absolutely satisfying. Should please any Belgian ale enthusiast of any persuasion."
"Oooh! I finally get to put my Caracole tulip to good use! Ah, and such good use it's starting out to be! Pours a beautiful deep amber/brown that still manages to be fairly clear. Medium-high head that's a dark cream color. Very tight bubbles that just do not go away. Smells wonderfully of malts! Malts! Malts! Raisin, caramel, bread, earth, sun, moon! No, wait, I'm getting carried away... Tastes like malts, man. Caramel, raisin, bread, earthy. Gently sweet and on the thicker side. Hey, if I had this on tap it'd be my every-day beer. But at 9.5% (which, hey, you can't even detect) a 750ml bottle is way more than too much for one person on any one evening!"
"750 ml bottle. Nostradamus pours out a brownish color with an off-white head that settles to a thin layer of foam. Dark fruit in the aroma, with tangy yeast, malt, sugar, and spices. Malty flavor with tangy fruit. The flavor is what you would expect from the aroma. A delicious cherry flavor stands out. Finishes with some spice, although not as strongly spiced as many beers in the style. This beer is similar to the Caracole Amber. Both beers have the same addictive flavor that makes it hard to put my glass down for very long. There is absolutely no sign of the 9.5% abv. Any fan of dark Belgian ales will love this for sure."
"Interesting and complex. Won't be an everyday beer (even if I could find it and afford it), but glad I tried it."
"much less sweetness in the flavor, which is definitely weaker than expected. it has a pleasant feel, medium-bodied and lightly carbonated, but overall the taste shows very little presence. a little sugary sweet, a little malt, but overall an oddly empty flavor with a clean finish. nothing that offends (except the metallic aroma), but nothing that stands out."
"This is a smooth drink beer, very velvety and enjoyable. The only thing hampering the drinkability is the high ABV."
"Pours a brown/amber, cloudy. Decent head, decent retention, very nice lacing. Smell was fairly strong of alcohol, but not in a bad ""this will taste awful"" kind of way, more of a sweet alcohol way. Taste is incredibly smooth, with little to no alcohol taste. Very sweet, in a dark fruit sort of way. Good mouthfeel, slight warmth from the alcohol, good amount of carbonation. I would definitely drink more than one of these if I had another, and if I felt like getting slightly drunk. But I don't have one, and I don't want to get slightly drunk. But I highly recommend it!"
"Pours a deep amber. Long lasting head and nice lacing. Smell was of fruit and roasted grain. You can smell the alchol. Taste was of rum rasin. Sweet,but not overly so. Finish was smooth,but with a nice burn.This is a very well balanced beer. One of the best I've tried."
"D: Likeable and approachable, but not as digestable as some Belgians."
"Taste -- The most prominent taste is a warm alcoholic burn followed by malts and roasted grains. This beer lacked in depth, but I will give it the benefit of the doubt as the strong alcoholic burn possibly indicates that I might need to age this one a bit. Overall, this is a tasty brew that could be made better by adding more flavorful ingredients. Nostradamus and Brasserie Caracole are vying for a market share in a competitive style and it helps if each brew would stand out."
"Do not pass up this massive beer if you get the chance!"
"Lounge, Steve Mcqueen/Shaft cool drinkability-5, goes well with Al Green."
"Given my enjoyment of the only other Brasserie Caracole beers that I've had prior to today (Ambree and Saxo), I prophesized that Nostradamus would be to my liking. I'm impressed by this delicious BSDA and have no problem recommending it to anyone who likes great beer."
"cheers..."
"Drinkability: Goddamn this is good, and I'll definitely be buying it again. I keep saying to myself, ""Well, this may be biased since I like the style so much," but so many BSDAs lately have impressed me to not end, and this is one of them. And also it seems to be in a category of its own as far as flavor, with different things melding and dominating than most versions of the style I've had. Try it for sure."
"Pours a cloudy brown with ruby highlights and a huge, creamy tan head that retains well...a beauty of a beer. The aroma is dominated by that trademark belgian yeast, dark fruits, candy sugar and some toasted bread as well as some mild alcohol. The flavor starts off with some big dark fruit flavors (plum, fig, grape and cherry), followed by candied sugar, funky barnyard belgian yeast, toasted bread, alcohol and some light mineraly hops. This is quite a nice belgian strong ale, reminds me of the abbaye de rocs beers without the overwhelming funky yeast. The mouthfeel is full and rich, but drinkability is only slightly above average. A very nice belgian; complex, strong and tasty."
"Opinion: I think that this is a pretty good beer, and one that I would definitely like to try again. I got a hold of a bad bottle of Ambree, so I had an eyebrow raised when I cracked this one open. I was pleasantly surprised. The alcohols are a little more noticeable in this beer as I would like, but you can't win them all. It is still a very approachable brew."
"This brew was a nice find at Surdyk's. I remember studying Nostradamus briefly in school and thinking he was interesting, so I had to try a Belgian ale with his namesake. Very worthwhile if it's available in your area."
"rom the 750 botlle @4.59 which I thought was a good deal. poured a nice dark amber with a light tan head. aroma, plums, raisins, fruity, caramel, alcohol, malt. flavor plums and other dark fruits, raisins, with a nicec toych of alcohol, yeast. very good."
" The taste is of bready malt, then dark fruit, even a hint of chocolate. This has a definite sweet finish. Light on the palate considering the flavor and ABV. Not so drinkable for me because of sweetness. I don't mind a sweet beer, but I wouldn't drink this all night."
"It is a nice watery brown with a orange tint around the edge, chunky white head that yeilds plenty of lacing. Smells of good yeast musk and a sweet swirl of malt and a hint of alcohol. Well first off wow a very well hidden 9.5% beer. A nice slight sour hint up front fades into a pleasent mellow malt sweetness all covered in a delicious yeast flavors. It has a good body even for its thin appearance and is very easy to drink overall."
"still pretty good all around."
"Mouthfeel is bubbley and chewy, a bit oily, and oddly fluffy in the back of the mouth. Highly drinkable considering the alcohol and sweetness- it's well-balanced, a nice end-of-the-day beer."
"Overall a very solid beer and a good representation of a double-strong. Could certainly put a few away."
"CHEERS! Beertracker"
"Nice full mouthfeel that hints at syrup in the middle, but is wiped clean by the finish. Strong but drinkable."
"The taste of tart fruits is distinct, and there's a moderate dose of malt and alcohol. Other than that, there's not a lot going on here. The flavors are pleasant and subtle, and I enjoyed drinking it, but there wasn't a lot here that encouraged me to keep drinking. I started paying closer attention, hoping to detect the wide range of flavors I expected, but I didn't find them. My experience is that many Belgian beers are better in the bottle than on tap. I would like to try this one again, in a bottle, to see if that holds true."
"Popping the cork reveals a dark rusty, murky amber color with yeast sediment, and a nice off-white head. Smell was spicey, with lots of dark fruits, and some caramel malts. Taste was more of the same - intense spicey clove, plum and prune and a sweet malty finish. You can definitely feel the 9.5% at first, but after a glass you kind of forget about it until it puts you to sleep. Mouthfeel is crisp but smooth. One bottle is definitely all you'll need of this bad boy. But what a tasty bottle it is. These belgians are growing on me."
"A terrific beer. Has all of the characteristics of a great Quad with other qualities that make it work well. Dark fruits, confectioner's sugar and sweet bread carry the aroma and initial flavors. Much more malty-sweet with brown sugar and maple combined with the candy sugars. More prevailant with plumbs, dates, figs, cashews, and a touch of chocolate. Not quite prunes or raisons, which is a good thing. Slight toasted character. Body is a touch fuller than most Trippels. Strong alcohol flavors throughout, but become a little medicinal toward the finish. Finishes both dry and sweet."
"Date best by Dec 06. This was given to me as a subsitute for another bottle of something else. At first I thought I would not like it, but it's very very good. I've had other brown ale's (domestic) and did not care for them at all, but this is another story. Pours a dark brown in color with a huge head. After awhile the head disapated and left some nice lacing. Scents of caramel and malt. There's a nice sweet taste with a medium body. At 9.5% and sweet in flavor, watch out, it will catch up to you in a couple of bottles."
"Overall: A very nice Belgian brown."
"Conclusion: Quite a nice brew this If this stuff was easier to find I'd defnitely buy more of it. Recommended!"
"To begin with, this beer was not much to look at. It was a clear reddish brown, with no head. When poured, or swirled, there was only a sudden bubbling, but then ever so quickly the tiny bubbles got shy and faded away. The aroma of this beer was great though. It was almost like a vanilla pound cake, a very desserty-type smell. Sweet and warm. A bit spicy but really a brown sugar or vanilla smell to it. Taste was even more of the same, and then some. Molasses, vanilla, alcohol, a tiny bit of spicy cinnamon or clove?, caramel, no, toffee, and a tinge of a roasty aftertaste - actually what it really reminded me of when I swallowed was raisin bran, strange as that may sound, before morphing into a very dry grapey aftertaste. That's the redeeming quality of this beer- if not for the dry aftertaste, it'd be like drinking syrup. Too sweet. Hot too. When I was nearing the end of my glass, I was reminded of Oerbier, which I hadn't had in a while. But yes, it is a bit similar to that, in it's toffee-roasty-dry-sweetness. A world of contradictions, yes, but the only way to describe this one. Mouthfeel was average- fizzy despite its appearance, and it had a bit of a numbing effect on my tongue and slipping down my throat it warmed me up all over. Drinkability was so-so, mostly because of the sweetness. Although the dry finish does wonders to cut the overwhelming sweet taste, it still is in the front, so would get sickening after more than maybe 2 of these. Plus the high alcohol would, like I said earlier, send me stumbling home if I treated it like a session beer. It's a good beer overall, and I will have it again. Just not a whole night of it."
"A great beer with dessert or even with a light dinner. A good choice on a hot night. Should be seved in a goblet style glass. Tast changes as beer warms. This is a strong beer. After having two I could feel myself getting buzzed! Overal I would rate this beer a 7.5 out of 10."
"At 9.5 % this one is not the best for a session, but a 750 does go down very nice, you'll definitely feel it. Best paired with a meal or a nice chocolate/caramel dessert."
"Drinkability is very high and it only gets better as it warms. Suggested serving temp. is 55 F. Pour it, let it sit for a bit, and enjoy. This is a great beer."
"Notes: I will drink this again, but it won't be an everyday beer or even a special occasion beer. Just a strange beer which passes the test. The trippy ""Alice in Wonderland-ish"" drawings on Caracole bottles are cool. The drawings are the reasons I tried these beers. I heard the the brewery is pretty new, maybe 15 yrs old, so this isn't some ancient brewery masterpiece."
"Scarlet maroon body sits in my chalice, looking very inviting. Poured at cellar temp, I believe this beer can hold up to the scrutiny. Nostradamus smell is sweet and funky, dark fruit and spice. Taste is sharp and earthy, fruity and slightly woody. Alcohol provides a nice tingling sensation at the end of the sip. A very good beer, but doesnt blow me away. In the style, there are many world class beers, and this is good, but not one of them."
"Brown with white head. Yeasty medium mouthfeel. Some tart dark fruit, on sweet side, with brown sugar and nuttiness, cloves and other spice. Barnyard aroma. Alcohol presence and astringency surprising. Strong carbonation. Thanks IPFreely. Good but not outstanding Belgian."
"I am not usually a fan of this style of ale, but this is well crafted and quite easy to drink. I agree with other reviews stating that this would be well paired with chocolate. Well worth a try."
"Nice deep burgundy color on this one with a gorgeous tan head. Lacing is decent. Aroma smacks me of port wine and figs. Taste has more of that potent sweetness but with a drying yeast character in there as well. Chocolate is noticeable along with caramel, currants, and a light fruit taste. Very nice. Sweet up front, alcohol in the middle, and drying in the finish. An all around good beer to be enjoyed here!"
"Flavor develops more as it warms up, so take your time and savor it slowly."
"Nice beer, certainly better than I expected. The body is on the light side of medium with ample carbonation, lending to the body of the beer. Smooth texture that is almost creamy on the tongue."
"Thanks to clvand0 for sharing this. It pours a dark brown color wih a finger of head that falls to coat the beer very well. The nose is complex, with some dark brown sugar or molasses, hints of dark fruit and some peppery spice and a nice whiff of alcohol in there. Wow. I really do like this. The flavor is smooth, with mostly dark brown sugar, but not sweet, and slight spicey fig. The feel is moderate with a minimal carbonation. Drinkability is as good as it gets. No hint of the alcohol in the flavor. Everything is well balanced and divine."
"Extremely refreshing, light in body, and easy to drink for a beer so strong. Flavors are particularly complex and well executed."
"Murky burnt sienna color, yellow-tan head rises to over 1/2 a inch in a tulip glass. Laces are thick, but keep falling down the glass. Interesting aroma, malted milk whiffs, some sourdough tanginess with yeasty notes. Mouthfeel is solidly medium, well-spaced carbonation that's overall lower in volume. Lots of ginger in the flavor, grading into dark molasses. Gets clove-ridden late in the profile, some pears, bitters with more hop than many without an overly sweet or sticky impression. Cognac-like with some alcoholic heat in the throat. Pretty good in that its rich with some brightness but not too sugary."
"Thanks again Stopper!!"
"great brew overall."
"This is a great Belgian Strong Dark Ale. Seek it out, it will not disappoint."
"The beer pours a dark ruby red color with a thick frothy offwhite head that fades to lacing. The aroma is great. It has a wonderful malty scent that is both creamy and tart. It boasts of pale and crystal malts along with a fruity yeast aroma. The taste is good. It has a complex malt bill that is rich in Belgian crystal malts. It goes down easy and mellows on the finish. For having an elevated abv., it is a smooth drinker. The mouthfeel is good. It is a full bodied beer with adequate to good carbonation. This is a damn good brew. It has excellent aroma and taste; a good drinker."
"Sampled at From The Vine beer tasting Jan 14th, 2005: This beer is a dark orange-brown color with a short-lived thin dark beige head. Thin lacing. Extremely sweet smell, with malt and a little yeast. Medium-bodied and very carbonated, with a mildly sweet character. Some spice and fruit are present, but all in all this beer is not really impressive for the style flavor-wise. The finish is sugary-sweet and malty. Not bad but nothing really makes this beer stand out."
"Feel is fairly rich and tangy with sweetness encompassed within a solid medium body but lacks some complexity as it sets the same feel from front to back. Mild, tangy, and enjoyable, a nice drinker that bodes well even with the 9.5%. Exceptional drinking when served at the listed 55 degree serving temp., definately not one to be consumed cold."
"Very well done and well balanced."
"soft aroma flowwery with a creamy sugary center, little estery and some alcohol. average mouthfeel with a good amount of carbonation that cleanses you palate. spicy alcohol and that unique yeasty spicyness mixes in the finish. head doesn't last long and becomes non existent after a bit. worth a try."
"i would drink it again, and would love to try it on tap."
"This is my first taste of this excellent ale, and I'm damned glad to have drunk it. ""Belgian brown ale"" says the label, but it's not like any other brown ale, from anywhere...possesses a zest that only the luckiest and happiest should take as their succur...and no matter what you were before, when you have it, you are one of them...I said ""yum"" already, right? No? Well, to nail it in the shell of the nut, ...there you go...yum, yummy, yummers..."
"Cloudy amber-brown in color with a frothy tannish-colored head. Nice lacing of the glass. Aromas are raisins/plums/other dark fruit mixed with caramel squares. Flavor carries many different sensations on the palate: cherry fizz cola, raisins, sugary caramel, some toffee, and a whiff of charred wood. Finish is dry, with hints of spice on the palate. Mouthfeel is just slightly thinner that expected, but still a very drinkable (read: sippable) beer. Great for a nightcap on a cold winter's night."
"11.2 ounce bottle. This bottle came from my own stash, but thanks to poundboy I have a backup."
"Drinkability: As this ale warms, it reveals more and more to the drinker; it begs to be treated like a fine cognac and deserves the drinker's attention"
" Wish I had more of this brew. Excellent."
"The sweetness in this beer makes me think that one at a time might be enough. Two would be too much. Like too much pie. Altough I can eat a lot of pie before tiring of it. Great job. I will buy again!"
"Final notes: This is a very complex and interesting beer. Maybe it's just not my style, but I think it's too all-over-the-place for its' own good. I'm definately intrigued though and I'll get it again to see if my opinions change now that I have a frame of reference. What's the deal with this beer?? It's weird, in a weirdly good way. That's all for now."
"The taste, however, is another story. Dry, with a lovely deep fruitiness of cherries, raisins and plums with brandy like alcohol and a finish of bubble gum, herbs and possibly candy sugar. A lover of merlot would enjoy this brew. The flavors blend so well together."
"Poured from a 11.2 oz bottle. I have been waiting to try this for awhile. I don't have the exact glass so I opted for a Duvel glass. The color is a light brown with a reddish tint. Very little head, which I am very suprised at. The smell is sweet, with hints of sourness. Almost punchy? Taste is much more pronounced. Kind of like a dubble or a oud bruin. Sour in the end and sweet in the beginning. Very well balanced just not that complex. I think this beer has so much potential, just lacks something that I can't place. I bit thin but I still like it."
"Maybe I drink too many American Style Ales and Imperial Ales, but I couldn't detect the hops in this ale; not on the front end (aroma) nor on the back end (bittering)."
"Very nice and different. A little roastiness, quite a bit of fruitiness. A little sweet, quite creamy. A hint of cherry soda in there. This is a nice, unique Belgian offering. A little like the Three Philosophers. Will boot you in the rear, so go slow. I will buy this again (thanks WOB)."
"Bottle: Poured a hazy/cloudy dark brown colored beer with a below average head which lack retention. Aroma consists of a strange mix of spices (cardamome??) and some very light roastiness. The mix of spices seems to be even more present while I drink this but the roastiness seems to have disappeared. Body is above average but carbonation could be better for Belgian Ale). Alcohol can be detected in the end, which I dont particularly enjoy. Overall, this one leave me a bit perplex because I did enjoyed the spice but the lack of roastiness and the fact that the alcohol is way too detectable leave me hanging a bit."
"This is labeled as a strong dark ale, but I would say this is a barleywine. The alcohol is very detectible at the end on the back of your tongue and fruity, raisin, maple syrup, and caramel flavors are all over the pallet. As well as a little hop in there. The smell is just that of a barleywine, sweet with a little bit of floral hops. As it warms the alcohol flavor gets stronger, and well does the fruit."
"Drinkability  This is an alcoholic sleeper, so watch out. I had the little 330ml bottle but a bomber will get your head spinning. Other than that, this went down quite well. I see some of the other BAs had this on-tap. What a treat that must have been!"
"From the quirkily-labelled bottle comes a dark red, light ruby, almost slightly purple coloured brew; cloudy and robust. To call it ""dark brown"" would be a discredit. Dark tangerine perhaps, but suffice it to say there are a great deal of different shades in the beer. The head was not overflowingingly massive, but just right. Dark cream/coffee colour, intensely creamy with slow moving screen lacing. In the aroma I first detect must, dark mouldy yeast qualities, which is not unpleasant. Next I smelt the dark malty sweetness, a warm alcohol note, and spicy fruit, nuts. There are strong grape juice aromas, and I definitely smell sharp aged cheese, which is singular. Sweet candy, with some sour/acidic smells too. The sweetness is not cloying, but complements the dry musky yeast expertly. The taste is quite unique, with dark malt sweetness and fruity yeast. Sugary sweet liquidy fruits, dry yeast finish, smooth syrupy on the middle. Prunes, overripe peaches or tangerines, and some caramel, bready cereals, toasted flavours, and saltiness. The lees tasted separately give all the same flavours except the potency is doublefold, and it looks as thick as melted caramel. Mouthfeel is full, lingering, syrupy, dry, with medium carbonation. High alcohol, extremely sweet mouthfeel followed by high dryness does not render this extremely drinkable. Perfect for an occasional indulgence, though."
"Poured a deep rusty brown with a white head. The head receded to lace fairly quickly, but there is more than enough carbonation in the brew to keep that up to the bottom of the glass, I think. The aroma is sweet, with hints of currants, plums, and an alcoholic caramel malt. The flavor is sweet and rich, with a neat spiciness about halfway through and lingering in the finish. Alcohol notes cut through intermittantly, but it's a swirling mass of caramels and fruit. This beer is very carbonated, and blinds the tongue with each sip, letting the thick malt character in through the back door unnoticed until he cracks you over the head with a pipe wrench. Very good beer, definitely on the ""will purchase again soon"" list."
"From a 750 ml bottle with an interesting-looking snail-elf on the label, it pours a slightly hazy brownish-red. The head is thick and full of little bubbles, leaving little spots all around the glass. It smell of dark, ripe fruit with the musty smell characteristic of many Belgians. The taste is raisin and ripe grapes at the start but continues to develop as it sits a while. It's a bit like drinking a goblet full of thick sugar water but somehow it manages to avoid being cloyingly sweet. Just a bit of hop bitterness keeps things nicely in check. In short, the taste is pretty remarkable. The alcohol, while warming, is almost absent in the smell and taste, making it dangerously drinkable. Very nice stuff."
"This one screams belgian ale. It is bursting with carbonation and sweetness on the tongue that barely masks a powerful taste of alcohol. Not overly complex, this one reminds me of many other belgian brews that have come before it. A good beer, but nothing worth rushing out and experiencing."
"Pours a wonderful brown with red highlights nice full beige head that settles to nice cap of little bubbles. Smells of dark fruit plums, figs with some spice. Tastes sweet molasses presence of rum soaked fruitcake then the alcohol kicks in and warms the belly. Brew has good mouthfeel carbonation makes it seem little lighter then it is. Drinkability is good would be a good beer for winter to warm your insides. Not the best of this style, would probably be better if alcohol was more subdued so other flavors would come out more."
"This is a luxurious treat. The taste is slightly tart with some alcohol presence. Everything about it is ultimately relaxing, exotic, pleasant. The bottle tends to drip a bit. But what the heck. So do I."
"Overall a very clean, well executed bottled beer. I shouldn't have worried."
"I have read a number of very good reviews about this beer, but once I tried it, I could not understand them. This beer may have some interesting things going on in it, but the alcohol was so overpowering (both on the palate and in the effects it had on me) that I could not enjoy it. I've had stronger ABV beers where you barely notice the alcohol; in this brew it was all I could notice. I split the 750 into two sessions and tasted on two different days to make sure it wasn't bad biorythems or something. Maybe it was a bad bottle. Having said all that, it was a medium brown (translucent- almost thin looking) with a small head that quickly vanished. Aroma had alcohol, malt, sweetness, vanilla (?) and slight yeast. Flavor was alcohol, alcohol, and alcohol. Hidden behind was some malt, soft bread, nutty tones and perhaps a bit of bite from hops. Drinkability- I could barely finish either glass in two sessions because of the alcohol."
"This is a big, malty, strong dark ale with a lot of spicy character. The alcohol is in your face most of the way, but there are enough complexities in the spice and malt to make it an afterthought. Very warming, overall, but not my favorite for the style."
"I really liked this beer. Good balance, great complex flavors and a nice job of hiding the alcohol."
"The taste is beautifully balanced. The uncharacteristic-to-style bitterness matches the sweetly pine-needle tastes of the malt. In this way, the beer is very refreshing for style, pierced by a level of high carbonation. The mouthfeel is medium and rather astringent - the heavy pricks of carbonation match with the bitterness to create one of the most imbibable dark ales around."
"notes: first beer served in my new, and first tulip style glass, a maudite glass. This beer was definitely deserving of it, I will be buying this one again, great all around"
"I'm proud to be giving this beer what I presume to be its highest rating thus far. Twice I've had it, and twice it's taken my breath away. This is simply one of the most well-rounded Belgian ales I've had. The sweet and yeasty character hits you full force, but a dark, fruity underlay is there to catch your fall. An argument for Belgian nationalism."
"Very well carbonated. Pours a lightly hazy garnet-amber color. The head is a light brown and quite thick. Aromas of raisins, apples, plum, candied fruit, bit of tropical fruit, and malt. Predominantly sweet and quite carbonated. Finishes with a yeasty astringent bite and a tannic edge that helps to balance the sweetness. The alcohol is just evident in the finish as well. This is quite a fruity beer, the sweetness definitely picks up this perception. There is a bit of a acidic sourness in the finish that really sets off this beer, I wish that it were even more sour (but I am off like that). This is pretty straight forward, with nice fruity notes being dominant. As it warms up the fruitiness combined with the sourness gives me notes of cherries. This is quite a tasty beer, at first I thought it was not as good as the others from Caracole, but this one is growing on me and I definitely like it."
"This is a nice Belgian dark ale that is spicier than most Belgian darks I have had. I would say it's quite drinkable if you aren't put off by spiciness (I love Indian food, so it's not really a problem for me). It went down rather easy for something the label declares is 9.5%abv."
"Apprearance is a brownish-grape with a light tan 2-finger head. The aroma is made up of sweet raisons, slightly musty yeast, and a warming alcohol. The taste repeats the aroma only the raisons come out screaming but are very balanced with the light alcohol and faint hops to create a nice harmony. This is a medium bodied brew and finishes sticky sweet. Very nice! Op uw gezonheid!"
"IMHO: Many of the Belgian Dark Ales have a strong presence of spices and hop finish that can overwhelm the balance of tastes. This beer does a does a better job than most by expanding the spectrum of flavors and maintaining a balance."
"Nice ruby tinged dark brown color. Bubbly thick light tan head. Traditional earthy Belgian brown aromas. Yeasty, with hints of cinnamon, and caramels. Taste is right along the same blend of flavors. Lots of sweet sugary toasted caramels, hints of cinnamon, earthy belgian undertones. As the beer sits, alcohol thins the body a bit, and becomes more noticable at 9.5 %. Lots of sweet candy flavors throughout. Medium to light bodied, very drinkable. Avery good Belgian Brown ale."
"Dark reddish-brown in colour, moderate off-white to tan head. Aroma very impressive, strong vinous sensasions; a bit like sugary dried fruit pies cooking in the open, but with hops too. Smooth on the tongue, quite malty and rich with a bit of diacetyl - which I don't mind. Sweetness lingers on the tongue for a while to give a smooth aftertaste; this is very dangerously drinkable and doesn't easily give away that it is as strong as 9.5% ABV (unless you read the label, that is!). A nice coating of yeast on the bottom of the bottle tells me there's nothing 'unreal' about this one..."
"My overall impression of the beer was that it just needed something more in any category to be noteworthy. Not sweet, and perhaps just a bit more fruit sweetness would have added some dimension. Not a great deal of bittering, nor significant yeasty phenols. As the beer warmed, a little caramel malt was present, but, again, not enough to make much of a statement. Really quite average in every department. I suppose the bottle art lead me to expect some creativity, and I was let down."
"Pours a dark chestnut color with a tall and foamy light tan head that slowly fades into a thick sheet of lace. Nose is rather complex with aromas of rum-soaked raisins, fig preserves, and some faint musty undertones. Fairly full-bodied and a bit syrupy in texture. Taste begins on the sweet side with notes of brown sugar and sweetened raisins leading to a bready and yeasty flavor. A mild spiciness follows along with notes of caramel and a bit of brandy that rounds out the finish. Thoroughly enjoyable brew here with a sweetness that becomes more pronounced as the beer warms. Some interesting pairings with many desserts could be done with this beer."
"Drinkability: Relatively drinkable. A good mix of a kriek and an oud bruin, if you ask me. Best paired with desserts (I'm thinking cheesecake) and not the burger I had."
"I'm not familiar with this brewery, Caracole, but they have an excellent creation with this prophetic offering."
"Cork dated 06-2001 bottling. Murky brown and ruby colored with a nice thick creamy tan head. Aromas of the faintest tart, like the skins from a black cherry, plus a big, overwhelming chocolate-like malt and some yeasty high-alcohol notes thrown in the mix; Complex. Tastes wonderful. Cocoa and vanilla with the faintest funky strawberry near the end. Seconds after the sip, it turns your mouth the smallest bit pucker. Mouthfeel is smooth, and silky..."
"Overall Impression: Quite tasty. A bit heavy and rich for a session beer, but the dry finish really triggers another sip. Slightly sweet, but it’s not cloying. Hides the alcohol very well. I’ll be looking for more of this: enjoyable."
"The high alcohol content is felt about halfway through the 22-oz bottle. The mouthfeel is syrupy yet balanced, very reminicient of a quadrupel."
"The hazy, dark brown beneath the medium-sized, fast, coarse, tan head looks promising. Plenty of malty, yeasty goodness in the sourish nose. Sweet, malty, thick, caramel body. Major alcohol and bitter chocolate in the finish. For me this is easily the best of the four Caracoles I've tasted. But to be honest, they didn't really blow me away."
"This Belgian dark ale was excellent! It reminded me a lot of aged Chimay, yum! The appearance was a dark blood red/maroon colour with a nice tannish head. The aromas were all sweet malts, yeast, candy sugar, spices, and alcohol. The taste followed suit to the aroma. The mouthfeel was creamy and thick....very filling and the drinkability was great for a beer of this size!"
"Taste is smooth and round, more fruit, warming alcohol with a fleeting appearance on the palate. Feels strong, but the body is considerably lighter than I had expected, very drinkable. a taste treat. quite a nice after dinner beer.. I'll be buying more."
"Drinkability: an awesome beer that i fully enjoyed. it seemed to apir up nicely with some gouda cheese."
"After a few of these, you too can see into the future.."
"Tarnished penny color, fairly clear. Just the tiniest bit of yeasty haze came with the last bit. Frothed over a bit as the bottle was cracked open, and the carbonation displayed itself brilliantly in the form of a big creamy colored head as it poured. Vinous in the nose, and fruity to the tongue. Very complex with lots of flavors -- a little pruney with some grape skin bitterness towards the end. Peppery alcohol, amidst a flurry of coriander and other spicy flavors, snaps up the fruit and berry flavors and finishes crisply. Very well-crafted beer and supremely easy to drink for such a big brew."
"I still liked it quite a bit. And I am eager to try this as it was meant to be. Even a botched bottle of this is quite interesting and better than most beers."
"What a great beer. Many thanks to the man....marc77."
"no head! a few piss bubbles on a flat orange brown color that reminds me of dried leaves. there are little suspended particles. why no head, is that right? can that be right? did i pour it too cold or something? whatever. a faint perfume of a spicy floral decay, a timid honey an underlying sugar maybe some butter toffee like scent a dark nutty malt odor rounding out the bottom. wow what a flavor though. a consistant honey flavor rides on a belgian poodle jumping through a hoop of real spice. the mouthfeel changes as it's tasted, first a crisp with the sweet start and and creamy in the middle with the spice and a drier wine afterfeel (if you will) that resides well with the spiciness. spices i detect include ginger, cinnamon, something i've never tasted before and have no idea how to identify (sorry), cocoa, dark toffee afterglow. there are some fruits and flowers too, all very ripe. do they have bannannas in belgium? there is a black (over-ripe) bannanna, a tad of apricot and orange oils. this is wine like but the flavor of grape or rasin is present but not very pronounced. there is a deep smokey malt way down there and on the way a roasty, toasty butter (not oily). the high alcohol % was never openly detected. it burps meekly. drinkability rated for one beer at a time, not a session beer, a special beer."
"Beautiful deep orange/amber color with a nice tan head.Malty and sweet,slightly spicy aroma.Big full bodied flavor-hints of orange, chocolate and coriander.Well rounded mouth feel-slight presence of alchohol.Overall a great beer-goes down smooth.The high alchohol is well disguised.I could see enjoying several of these in a sitting."
"Overall it was just another great belgian. A little chalky as it warmed in the finish, but beyond that, for the price it's right up there with some of the better trappist ales."
"This beer pours a dark amber with ruby highlights and has a moderate fluffy head. The aroma is sweet with some spices. The flavor is very smooth - sweet fruit and toasted malts. The palate holds the toasted malts and is very nice. I really enjoyed this beer."
"Deep amber and cloudy yet a firey red when held before bright light. A thin tan dense head sits atop. Has a slight plumb aroma and I detect a bit of raisin as well. Full bodied and creamy with a slight dryness in the finish. Flavor is malty and slightly sweet. Not as fruity tasting as the others I just rated. Alcohol is well hidden. Quite smooth yet not as complex as the Rochefort 10 or St Bernardus Abt 12. Still an excellent ale that is full bodied and flavorful."
"The aftertase is quite persistent, with licorice, and some alcohol again."
"This was one beautiful beer. I am just now getting into the whole belgian beer ""scene", so I figured this would be a good start, as well as the trappist that I have had. I really liked the bottle's design. It was kind of trippy, with the snail dude with the binoculars looking at stars and stuff. The color was a murky brown with a creamy super thick head, which I was totally into. The aroma was a hearty beefy smell with a little hint of floral tones. Taste was out of this world, eccept for the tinge of alcohol that was left behind, which brought it's points down. All in all a very smooth brew and I will definately be back for more!"
"This brew whose cork was dated 10/2002 poured a very invigorated head. Pour only 1/4 glass of this one or it will foam up and over flow your mug in no time flat! It had a large light brown head of small bubbles. Its body is a yeasty cloudy dark brown with a lot of carbonation rising. It had an aroma of hops and malt. It was initially bitter and had a strong after bite, but its bitterness was not so strong as to ruin the smoothness."
"Good carbonation - cork on the 750ml can blow off if you are careless. Pour slowly - ton of yeast left in bottom of bottle. Sweet raisiny nose, clear dark ruby color. Fairly smooth some fizz, with some hoppy overtones but this is a brew that should be mellowed. Small label is as if it were intended for a 12oz. $8.40 for a 750."
" I will definitely drink this one again."
"The other Caracole beers I had sampled left me with a fairly good idea that I'd enjoy this one, and so I've been saving it up for a night where I can afford to get into some 750ml 9.5% ABV trouble. Things looked good right from the pour. The beer is a deep, deep ruby in color, with a moderate-to-thin sized creamy and persistant light tan head. The aroma was an enticing blend of slightly sweet toasted malt, peppery alcohol spiciness, and lingering must. The flavor contines in much the same vein, though it adds a surprising character of dry fruit -- berries, grapes -- to the mix, substituting for the bready flavors often found in these beers. Toasty malt remains the dominant flavor, however, and lingers pleasantly in a long-lasting aftertaste. Saaz-like hop finish is mild but lends some balance. Full bodied with a overall dry finish, this isn't the most complex Belgian dark ale I've had, but it's pleasant and surprising nonetheless."
"A decent all around Belgian brown. This beer pours out a hazy dark brown with a slightly orangish tint. The tan semi-large head fades quickly to a thin layer with minimal lace. Sweet on the nose with a powdery aroma and some fruit. Although not abundantly complex Nostradamus sports a somewhat sweet and fruity flavor with an alcoholic spiciness. Mouthfeel is nice with a mouth-coating creaminess and slightly slick and oily character. This Belgian definately gets good marks in the ""bang for the buck"" catagory. I believe this will start to be more widely distributed so if you see it, go ahead and pick one or two up."
"The cork on this bottle is dated 10/2002. This brew poured an excellent head. The aroma was fruity and sugary in my opinion. It had an aftertaste that seemed to linger though. All in all, not a bad brew in my personal opinion. I would probably drink this one again if the opportunity presented itself."
"I'm surprised that Brasserie la Caracole hasn't got more attention. It's in my opinion a wonderful hidden belgian brewery. This brew pours with a cloudy garnet color and a tan head that slowly diminishes. Alcohol is sweet and wine-like with some alcohol. Taste is initially of caramel and dark fruit. It finishes with a spicy alcohol flavor."
"The alcohol level at 9.5% is very present but I think it really brings out a nice stong flavour in the beer. The flavour is a nice strong matly fruity taste. This one has a real kick and should only be drunk after a meal or at least you need ot have something on your stomach. Perhaps a nice after diner beer?."
"Thick and powerful. Sheesh! This is the kind of beer that you could split among friends after a wonderful evening's meal. I am beginning to love Belgium; this beer could stir your affections in that direction, it really could."
"sipping beer or an accompaniment to some strong cheeses."
"750ml corked bottle.Cloudy hazy creamy dark reddish color, nice big foamy off white-tan head that lasts, yeasty, fruity and spicy aroma. Bready malty fruity flavors, full and soft palate, sweet yeasty banana bitter sweet finish, not the best but not bad and worth a try."
"750ml corked and caged bottle. Vintage (Oct) 2001. Cloudy chestnut brown. Nose consists of dark ripe fruits  raisin, prune and molasses and a no shit alcoholic aroma. Head is tan and momentarily densethen dissipates to none at all. The complex, dark sweet fruit flavors are countered by a spicy alcohol kick. Mouthfeel is full and the texture syrupy and slick. Carbonation starts out prickly, then yields to smooth. This is one serious ass brew. This beer is challenging, even after 16 months in the bottle. It almost demands an accompaniment (food, cheese, chocolate, etc.)."
"This beer was a cloudy medium dark brown color and had an off white head that left some lace as it subsided. An aroma of malt, caramel and fruit. It had a flavor of malt, toffee and fruits. A warming effect of the alcohol present was is the finish. A somewhat chewey beer, as some have said."
"A bit foggy on the pour, the color deep red to almost purple and the head monstrous and frothy in texture. As it erodes it leaves a thick glutinous sheet to smother the glass. Earthy aromas, musk like vinous, hints of bubble gum and a very complex nose. Quite sweet at the front with a middling top, finish is tart, spicily hopped, moderately carbonated dry and somewhat alcohol bitter aftertaste, a real treat and not to be missed."

"Clear dark garnet hue if decanted off the sediment, w/ lively carbonation supporting a light tan, thick smoothly bumpy head. Sherryish alcohol upfront in aroma, followed by sweet, fruity esters akin to ripe strawberries. As it breathes, maltiness and darker fruit esters become more pronounced, consisting of bittersweet dark caramel and chocolate malt and sugary figs. The aroma becomes progressively more toffeeish over time. Heaty fusels and phenol surface as well. Boldly aromatic, but not as seductive as other Dark Strongs. It's quite enticing nonetheless aromawise. Flavorwise, fruity, raisiny sweetness is perceived at first, then pronounced clove ensues. Pseudosweet, lightly peppery ethanol combines with the clovey phenol to form a mellow black licorice note. Both dark caramel derived and residual sweetness are left relatively unhindered by the paltry hop bitterness. A touch light in body, w/ a dry, alcoholic mouthfeel. The apparent copious use of dark candi sugar lends a combination of constituitively expressed cidery sweetness and heavily caramelized, molasses notes. Malt character is somewhat overshadowed by dark fruitiness and alcohol, and other than dark caramel malt, mild chocolate malt exists as an undertone. Finishes cleanly sweet with a light sensation of alcohol spice on the lips. Nostradamus is a raw, flavorful and complex brew. With adequate cellaring to smooth out the slightly rough edges, this will be outstanding. Although tasty in its current state, both ethanol and higher alcohols deter both the malt and ester profile from reaching their full potentials. Bottled Jan 2002."
"This is an excellent beer. Pours a murky reddish color, with a small, creamy, off-white head. Smells of sweet toffee malt, with hints of fruit (cherry, I think), and light alcohol. Nice, sweet toffee malt flavor, with stronger fruity esters. Finishes with a slightly bitter, alcohol filled taste. Rough, chewey beer...one that I'll definitely try again soon. (or perhaps stock a bottle away for a year?)"
"750 ml bottle, corked & caged. The cork is dated 1/2002 so it's just 10 months old. As is the case with most Caracole beers, I feel this needs to age a bit to dry it out a little and increase the carbonation level. This bottle is a bit young and I'm disappointed that I didn't age it. That said... ... A rough pour brings up a short and foamy light tan head that rests shortly over a slightly hazy and deep copper body. The head drops, but keeps a good collar and light surface covering throughout the glass. The nose expresses mild dark fruit and sweet toffee-ish malt with some clear alcohol. The body is light/medium with an exceptionally fine but limited carbonation that's very soft and smooth in the mouth. The flavor starts malty and stays malty, displaying a lightly woody character, some fruitiness (including ripe berries and a gentle cherry), a mild but quite sweet toffee-ish note, and a noteable alcohol. It's rich but not really complex. The bitterness is limited but balances well, and makes a minor appearance at the swallow. It finishes dry - probably more from a high alcohol content than bitterness - with a mild licorice-like note. A really nice beer that probably makes a better apertif or nightcap than it does dinner companion or drinking buddy."
"What a great beer. Complex and powerful, but also highly drinkable. Its fizzy carbonation also helps to make this beer deceivingly light on the palate. Would make a nice night cap, or pair nicely with rich chocolate sweets."
"Brew at this level goes to show you that beer can be just as complex if not more complex than wine. I could see paring this with a light chocolaty treat or to as a digestif. Very tasty without any of the flavours being too much to handle."
"Notes: Big, dry and in you face. Flavours flare out just about everywhere with a broad complexity. A brew to savour as a night cap after a big meal to settle the body  sip and enjoy."
"Pours clearer and with a shorter lived head than most belgians.  Nice combination of chocaltely burnt malts and berry fruit flavors.  Again, less yeasty.  Tastes closer to a dark tripple as it warms.  Nice beer, but not over the top."
