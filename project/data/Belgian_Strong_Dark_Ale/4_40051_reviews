"Very good dark fruit and roasted flavors with some black licorice, but it had a slightly metallic taste but it could have just been because it was on cask."
""
""
"O:  Great beer."
""
"""Belgian-style stout"" -- and like the best of both worlds. Reads like a stout, but with a subtle touch of that Belgian yeast."
""
"Pours a dark brown, almost black, with a coffee colored head. The smell was full of espresso and coffee notes. The taste had a lot of coffee in the beginning and then some sweet dark chocolate flavors came through with a light finish. Very nice stout."
"Overall a good beer.  It was a little too bitter for my taste."
""
""
""
""
"Corked and caged. Pours a pitch black with almost no head. Smells smokey, with hints of black licorice and chocolate. Tastes like chocolate and very malty. Overall a fantastic beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"Very thin and carbonated for a stout. Poured with almost no head. Had a burnt coffee taste."
"O- Enjoyable beverage, very well crafted."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a solid tasty beer. An oak, coffee aftertaste. This beer goes down easy, smooth. Nothing bad here. A drinkable refreshingly stout. A little carbonation. Nothing overpowering."

"The front of this beer was really fantastic.  The yeast strain they use, plays very nicely with the roasty notes and mouth feel is great.  Then something goes completely wrong.  The far back end/lingering flavor I can only think of one word to describe: sewer.  There is a dirty/rank flavor that wasn't completely overpowering, but definitely present enough to ruin the beer.  The other people that I shared the bottle with didnt seem to detect it so I am guessing it is something specific to my palate that just didnt sit right."
"Very tasty, best when it warms up and the Belgian yeast profile comes forward.  I'll get this again."

"Overall, color me impressed.  Getting the characteristics of two of my favorite styles together in one beer made me quite happy.  This is an easy beer to enjoy on a cool evening."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall:  This is a very tasty stout.  Not world class or excellent, but a very solid, very tasty stout.  Definitely worth getting."
"Draft from Taco Mac into a snifter.  Dark black color with 1 finger of tan head by the time I got it.  Traditional notes of espresso, dark roasted malts and dark chocolate.  Tastes much the same but smooth.  Typical espresso aftertaste but not overpowering.  Like it."
""
""
"Typically I'm a fan of the belgian yeasts but this beer had a pretty bad after taste."
""
"Easy drinking, complex and satisfying. A great brew."

"I have had this a couple of times now and find it to be really enjoyable.  While it lacks complexity, it's a more refined, easy-drinking stout where all the aromas and flavors blend nicely."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This was very unimpressive.  Little to no aroma with a taste and mouthfeel that was all over the place.  Great example of trying to combine several things (belgian style, stout, roasted, chocolate) and having it fail to mesh."
""
""
""
""
"Kind of thin.  Not what I typically want from a stout."
""
"Bitter - in a good way. The leathery, cocoa-ish taste lingers on the palate even minutes after your previous sip. This is good stuff. And you know, the smell alone is almost rich and flavorful enough to be satisfying without even taking a sip. But drinking adds a whole lot to the experience."
"This is an interesting beer. BA has it down as a Belgian Strong Dark Ale but Allagash markets it as a Belgian Style Stout. I have to agree with the brewer on this one; it is far more consistent with a stout than a BSDA. I've reviewed 7 beers in the BSDA category (and many more unlogged) and 25 stouts. I'd like to try this again but it doesn't scream Belgian to me. Much more of an American double stout. Nice beer though."
"had this in bottle and on draft.  Very solid stout"

"t/m/o - opens up with deliciousness...I mean this beer kills it.  Great roasted chocolate with a fairly forward nuttiness.  Almost tastes like a peanut butter beer...must be the Belgian sufpgars and the hopping (this is a fairly fresh bottle as I understand it).  Super easy drinking while having the body of an oatmeal stout.  Really good.  Belgian stout indeed!"
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Original beer, it felt to me like a mix between a Belgian IPA and an Oatmeal stout. A bit sweet, though within style."

"BOD 156/14.  Pours almost black with a quite a bit of dark ruby.  Normal head with above normal lacing and retention.  Light nose of chocolate, Belgian yeast, candi sugar and hints of dark fruit and roast.  Medium bodied with a nice slick texture that hints at creaminess.  Above normal carbonation with effervescence in the middle and finish.  The excellent flavor profile is of reasonable intensity, quite complex and exceptionally balanced.  It begins with semisweet dark chocolate over a very mild roast character.  As the effervescent middle begins, the chocolate fades to candi sugar sweetness and more of the roast character is noted.  As this sweetness fades, dark fruit notes come to the forefront.  The finish is smooth, but has dry characteristics, and a bit of hop flavor and bitterness in addition to hints of coffee.  A slight dark chocolate note lingers.  The alcohol (7.5%) is totally hidden."
"Overall- a distinctive beer with neat tastes and feel working for it."

"OVERALL: This is labeled a Belgian style stout and is called Black, but this is certainly more of a Belgian strong dark ale and is more ruby and brown in color. Not all that great of a stout, even for a Belgian stout, but a decent strong dark ale. Glad to have tried it, but wouldn’t need to drink it again per se. Thanks again for the beers guys!"

"Overall:  Allagash labels this beer as a Belgian stout on the label and I reviewed it as such(I didnt review this as a Belgian strong dark ale). I am not a huge fan of Belgian stouts, but this Belgian stout by Allagash is among the best that I have drank.  This is a complex and layered beer with a fantastic mouthfeel."
""
""
""
""
"O: Solid beer, not my style very much but well done.  A little less bitter roast would improve drinkability.  Allagash has climbed my upper eschelon of breweries."
""
""
""
""
""
"Wow! Smooth, chocolaty, dry, bitter and creamy beer. It's one of my go to beers. It just gets better every time I try it. A well crafted gem."

""

"The texture really makes this beer - the creamy, very fine soft carbonation enhances the malt flavors and have you wanting more. The body is lighter than the flavor and alcohol might suggest but the creaminess makes it feel like more. Carbonation is a little above average."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Initially I was going to give this beer a lower rating, but as I drank it, it grew on me. Very drinkable for the style. For sure on the low end ABV for this style, but still pulled off well. At almost 4 bucks a bottle I wouldn't recommend it, because there are other options that are, I believe, better."
""
"Pours jet black,hence the name.I have to say that thisjust didn`t hit me as being that great.Maybe the price of 10.99 is the reason i expected more.Nothing really jumps out at you when you taste this .So many of the better beers really have a flavor that just says i`m a badass.This doesn`t have it.Try if you must but i think you might be disapointed."

"Very smooth, drank it fairly quickly.  Taste like almost nothing except belgian hops. I tasted no fruits nor sugars or anything really.  Rather bland but very smooth. I sure felt it after drinking it"
""

"Bottled on 03/16/2012. Not usually a huge fan of this one but the age seemed to give it some drinkability. Nice start to my cellaring journey"

"Pours the darkest brown with cola hues and a mocha head of foam. Nose is malty nutty, rich fruity with orange zest, orange blossom honey.  Just lovely malt with a touch of honey and spice.  Fruit and perfume like fruits and nuts, wheat. Light subtle sweet cocoa, earthy complex malts, dry yeast.          Twigs and fruit.  Biscuity malt, faint char, a bit of burnt wood.  Some kind of bright herbal hop spice.  Cheerful hop bitter in a dry pleasant finish. Creamy oats. Lustrous mouthfeel with a malty depth.  Bubbly light with a light crisp middle. Dry bitter finish with some sweet caramel to lie underneath."

"Overall: A terrific beer - one to savor and enjoy. Inviting, complex, and delicious. A personal favorite that I'd recommend to anyone."
""
""
""
""
"D: The best part for me is the plums and cherries – which really standout here, and isn’t usually the case in this style – coupled with the heavily roasted malt."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a nice tasting brew that goes well with sweeter foods."
""
""
""
""
""

""

""

"Just had this again from a sixtel tapped at home and it was excellent.  A refreshing, malty, black ale full of subtle flavor qualities, with some hop presence and great drinkability.  The ability to dial in the carbonation at home really helped."
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a great American option to Chimay Blue. Not to say that it doesn't measure up, it is an Outstanding overall beer in its own right. I would by this one again, and will definitely seek it out on tap."
""
""
"Overall this is an interesting beer that starts out like a stout and then morphs into a more dynamic Belgian influenced beer with more changes and flavors coming out as it warmed. I liked this brew and want to try it again to see how it may differ and hopefully be better."

"Pours a black color. 1/4 inch head of an off-tan color. Decent retention and decent lacing. Smells of chocolate, sweet malt, yeast, hint of hop, and oatmeal. Fits the style of a Belgian Strong Dark Ale. Mouth feel is smooth and crisp, with a low carbonation level. Tastes of sweet malt, yeast, hint of hop, roasted malt, chocolate, and slight oatmeal. Overall, weak appearance, but decent aroma and body, good feel and blend."
""
""
""
"Overall - Hmm. Pretty, pretty good. Actually reminds me a bit of Grand Teton's Black Cauldron, though I slightly prefer the latter; when price point comes into play, it's a no brainer. Not as much Belgian influence as I expected, but just enough so as to not discredit the claim of ""Belgian Style Stout""."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I thought I might like this, even though I can pick out a number if reasons I wouldn't, as well. I think it straddles the tastes of a barleywine and American stout, the Belgian influence subdued or balanced by roasted malt flavors. Will definitely grab this again."

"Given The Old Lady's shock & outrage at how I pour beers when I visited her last summer, I promised her that I would be gentle with bottle-conditioned beers or ones that were explicit about how they should be poured. Despite my very slow, gentle pour, I still garnered a finger of foamy, light-tan head with decent retention. Color was a deep, dark reddish-brown (SRM= > 27, < 34) with good clarity and mahogany highlights. Nose was reminiscent of Belgian chocolate - sweet, but not cloying, plus the yeast gave it a slightly vinous quality. Interesting. Mouthfeel was creamy. I have to say, there was an initial fusel alcohol heat with this one. It mellowed out to create a semi-sweet chocolatiness, but when coupled with the yeasty flavors, I am glad that it is not classified as a ""Stout"" on here. It was Stout-like, but at the same time, it was not a Stout. Finish was semi-dry with it being a battle between the chocolate malt and the yeast plus alcohol for supremacy. I was glad to have been able to drink and review one, but it is not the sort of thing that I would normally buy for myself."

"Overall: 4.5? I don't want to give this beer too much credit but I quite like it. I'm a fan of the dark malts and slight roastiness combined with Allagash's ester-y Belgian overtones. If only it weren't so damn expensive. $13 for a 4/pack! Never again, no matter how much I like it! Well, maybe once more, but never again after that!"

"Wonderful stout but I did get the metallic after-taste. Packaging is eye catching with twisted wire and captured cork. Nice touch. The label indicated ""pour into your favorite glass"" which is a first for me but not an issue since I found this while travelling. Definitely one I will have again."
""
""

"O: Allagash puts a tasty twist of the stout here with its strong Belgian overtones. I think this beer is a classic in its own right, along with Allagash White. Anyone who is a fan of either stouts or Belgian beer should try this."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O: There are definitely better examples of this variety. Nothing noteworthy or worth getting another one if other choices are available."

"Overall I really like this one. Great combination of yeast and malt."
""
""
"Bottled on 2/7/14 as per bottle. Deep clear brown. A slight ruby hue at the bottom of the glass and nice creamy off-white head. Head has great retention and leaves some nice lacing. Aroma is an interesting blend of traditional roast notes and hints of Belgian yeast. The flavor is interesting, as well. The roasted notes from the dark malt are significantly mellowed out by the Belgian yeast. There is a nice interplay between the two. The weight of the beer is a little lighter than a more traditional stout but with the lighter flavors it matches well. This is an excellent twist on a traditional stout and Belgian dark."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Overall this is quite an enjoyable beer but it could draw quite a bit of controversy if examined closely. It might leave one wondering why I rated this beer in such favorable light. For lovers of Belgian Dark ales, unfortunately I would not recommend this beer to you. It has a great lack of complexity and yeast character. It does quite well as a stout, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for that. I feel that the minor contribution of Belgian yeast flavor does add enough to make it more than your standard stout, so those looking for a delicious stout will undoubtedly agree that this is an outstanding beer."

"O: A very enjoyable beer, on the malty and sweet side. Not really a stout though"
""
""
""
""
"I really liked this beer it is the perfect winter complement to their Allagash White. I got some light clove notes from the yeast that blended really well with the flavors from dark roasted malts. The Belgium yeast was very dominant in the aroma with light notes of coffee."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- It's a pretty good beer, the flavors really ring true to the belgian style. It does seem to tire out the palate a bit. Little heavy on the roast to me. But over all not bad."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This beer poured very smoothly into a snifter with a soul blacker than curious George is curious. The snifter definitely accentuated the smells and it was a divine aroma of dark chocolate coffee and maybe BlackBerries. I was just slightly less whelmed by the taste which had more of ground-up cigarettes to it. I was underwhelmed by the finish which was a little rough. Overall this was an okay beer I can't say that I'm going to go out and get another one especially considering the price."
""
""
""
"The mouthfeel is a smooth medium bodied feel. It is rather easy going."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: It was kind of meh at first but really grew on me as it warmed. Nothing spectacular but certainly worth a try."
"O: Overall a great looking and tasty complex little brew, well worth looking for. Allagash is never disappointing."
""
""
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a black color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of some chocolate, a bit of yeast and fruits. Taste is kind of mild, roasted malts, a hint of chocolate, a very mild bitterness. Feels full bodied in the mouth and overall is a pretty good beer, but didn't meet my expectations."

"O- I swear, I have yet to have an Allagash beer that's anything less than excellent."
""
""

"Bottle at Ava’s in Easton. Poured into a pint glass. Pours dark brown with some ruby showing through the light, not particularly dark for a stout. Aroma of yeast, candi sugar, some chocolate, spice. Flavor follows with a similar profile: candi sugar and yeast, some light chocolate, sweet and spice finish. This tastes closer to a Belgian Strong Dark ale than any stout, but good in that vein. Medium mouthfeel with medium carbonation, rather light for a stout. Overall this was a pretty good beer but not one to go for if you’re looking for a creamy stout. Definitely Belgian inspired."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- I will certainly seek this out again, an excellent offering from Allagash."
""
"Price Point - ~$3/12 oz bottle"
""

"Never had it when the bottle has aged for awhile, living close to the brewery I've only ever had it on the fresh side. Curious as to what age (not in a barrel) does to it."

"Overall: This stout is a little safe. For a Belgian style stout I would expect some sort of funkiness or spiciness from the yeast. This is delicate and can leave you wanting something more out of it. The feel on this beer is where it really lets me down. The body could be more fuller and smoother for being a stout. Maybe it is, but the carbonation makes sure your attention is more on the poppy sensation on your palate. This is very polished and well crafted. Just some of my pet peeves at work. This one just isn't all that entertaining in my opinion. This ale was still worthy of my time."

"I never feel like Allagash goes wrong for me. Had on tap at the Yard House which is a great place for my favorite hobby. Poured into a goblet. Fresh keg they told me. Keg must have been made by a midget as the pour was very short. I will look the other way. Sometimes the one you love disappoints you. Back to the beer. Smells chocolate my and malty, and has a deep brown color. This is a great beer...not overly heavy. Has a sweet cocoa taste but a nice carbonated fresh drink. Very great. Kudos...wish I had more...tears...."

"750 ml bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 3/15/2013. Pours nearly pitch black color with a 2 finger fairly dense tan head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of dark chocolate, roasted malt, cocoa, pear, apple, raisin, clove, pepper, toast, floral, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of malt and fruity/spicy yeast notes; with good strength. Taste of dark chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, pear, apple, clove, pepper, raisin, toast, light char, herbal, floral, and yeast earthiness. Lingering notes of dark chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, pear, apple, clove, pepper, raisin, toast, light char, herbal, floral, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and complexity of roasted malt and fruity/spicy yeast flavors; with a nice malt/spiciness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a crisp, moderately prickly, and lightly chalky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice Belgian stout style. All around nice balance and complexity of roasted malt and fruity/spicy yeast flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A very enjoyable offering."

"Despite being exactly what the bottle says it is -- a Belgian-style stout, Allagash Black is quite disappointing. Boring and demure despite a reasonably stout 7.5% ABV, it's not a bad beer but also not worth the price."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I have heard Allagash makes some outstanding beers, so I saw this and decided to give it a try. It had a small creamy looking head, about one finger, that disappeared pretty quickly. I picked up on a chocolate and toffee smell, and a chocolate taste and a very present sweetness that lingered for awhile afterwards. I thought this beer was pretty decent, but the sweetness was a bit much for my taste, but it was worth it."

"O - Not as good as I remember from tap, but not bad either."

"This isn't a bad beer at all...it's certainly different. Basically a light stout with the infusion of candied sugar. Goes down pretty easily."

"Pours a deep black with a large rocky cream colored head. Very good head retention and lacing. Aroma is dark roasted caramel and chocolate malt, yeast and slight fruity esters. Taste is dark mildly roasted caramel and chocolate malt, some notes of Belgian flavored yeast and fruitiness, mild bitterness from the roasted chocolate malt and mild tartness. Palate is a medium body, slight creamy mouth feel with mild carbonation. Finish is a mild roasted caramel and chocolate malt with some bitterness, some Belgian yeast, tartness and fruity. My take on this, it is a good, tasty and enjoyable brew."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, it seems an America version of BSDA. Not bad and I consider this a palate stretcher. If you're tired of malty ales, this one starts the swing back to the ""less malty"" portion of the spectrum."
""
""
"Dark color and great taste. A sweet smell that translates into a smooth drink. I know this is one of the best stouts I have had. Very smooth and flavorable. Just a great taste. One of the beers I would say everyone who ha had one should try again. I am going to bring some home to share."

""
"Overall - Interesting blend, while it didn't ""wow"" me it definitely is Allagash caliber. I personally would not revisit this one but fans of ""Belgian Stouts"" may find it has what they are looking for and should give it a shot."
"Overall a very drinkable Belgium ale but not the stout I expected. Still they do make great ales but I am not sure this is worth 4 dollars a pop."

"Overall: I've adored more complicated strong dark ales, but this could be a real go-to! I think it has an interesting, yet rather universal appeal (if the universe were made up of people who at least appreciated and understood good beer, that is). Color me solidly impressed."
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a tasty and vivacious brew that's nearly too perky for its own good. A little more sweet and mellow, and this could be really exceptional. As it stands, it tastes more like a less sophisticated version of Pepe Nero, which is hardly a bad thing."

"O: I wouldn't call this Allagash's best, but it's a very drinkable brew with exceptionally complex flavor notes. I could definitely see myself drinking this one a lot while kicking back later in the day."

"Overall this beer is pretty decent, but I have a hard time finding anything about this beer that I would dub as special. It's surprisingly light for a stout which makes it easier to drink than most American stouts but comes up short in the flavor category. Overall a great beer for those looking to make a stout a session beer."
""
"O: Complex with several layers of flavors developing as the session progressed. It was almost like having a different beer with every sip. Multitudes of fruit, chocolate, and roasted malts develop a terrific brew. Will have this again soon. Cheers!"

"O - I've always ignored this one for some reason. I guess the idea of Belgian yeast in a stout didn't sound like it would be up my alley. However, I'm really digging this beer. Its really easy drinking and pleasant and the Belgian touch is just right."

"This is notoriously one of the worst designed labels I've ever seen. Or is it the best? It is ""black"" after all."

"It has been too long since I last had this stuff, so it's nice to find it on tap at my favorite haunt. It pours a straight onyx topped by a finger of khaki foam. The nose comprises light dark chocolate and very light roasted malts. Everything is too vague and ethereal to get a good read from. The taste brings in more of the same, though everything is quite stronger, and there's the added bonuses of some very light anise and a hint of a spice medley. The body is a stolid medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a fluid feel. Overall, despite a meek smell and a slightly thin body, this stuff ain't half bad. As the prototypical Belgian stout in the States, I can easily appreciate the effort."
"O - The label says belgian stout, but BA has it down as a belgian strong dark ale. I'd tend to agree with the latter."
""
""
""

"O - interesting. Strange orchard fruit intertwining with the dark malts are unusually satisfying."

"Poured from a bottle into a snifter, the beer is a dark, almost black coloring with hazelnut highlights and a thin, filmy, light tan head. Aromas of roast coffee, both bitter and warm, with a meaty heartiness and touch of smoke. Some funk from the yeast, too. Flavors of dark fruit sweetness, with plum and date in the backbone, and a coffee highlight, bitter and roasted. Very well blended. Roasty and bitter aftertaste, with a touch of campfire. Light, filmy, slightly effervesced finish, with a roasty linger. Tasty brew."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The relative lightness of the alcohol wasn't a deterrent either. While certainly present, it wasn't high for this style and couldn't be detected until I was close to finishing this off. Since the carbonation was somewhat high, it helped to take the bite off of the stickiness from the sugar and made this relatively easy to down. Someone new to this style would be well-versed to begin with this, since it's a solid take on what a Belgian Dark Strong Ale should be."

"Overall a respectable beer, with 7.5% abv, and a mix of American stout and Belgian dark ale."

"Since I love this style, this beer had a good headstart right from the start. I wasn't disappointed. This was a tasty, slightly bitter, beer with hints of coffee and mild spices. Very easy to drink, good balance. Another quality beer from Allagash. Nice."
""
""
"O- my first Belgian stout, and one that I'd like to try more of. You can definitely pick out the Belgian flavors, yet it's combined with dark charred malt."

"overall, a nice ale, but not one I'll be searching out again"
""
"O: A rich and somewhat sweet Belgian with enough dark roasted grains to be a bit more stout than dark strong. There is a ton of flavor going on here. I really enjoyed this years ago and haven't found any for a while, since that time I've grown more partial to drier beers but still a great beer in it's own right. I'd still try this if I find it on tap but I won't be going out of my way for a bottle."
""

"O: Stouts and Belgian beers are two of my favorite categories, so I was excited about this. I wasn't disappointed. The beer is great as a stout, and the Belgian qualities to shine through."

"Another phenomenal Belgian from Allagash. Easy drinking, well balanced, and great with a chocolate dessert."
"Pours a very dark brown, almost black in color. Creamy, but somewhat thin tan head. Smells of cocoa powder. Taste begins with some sweet caramel, followed by some tart, herbal flavor, then some coffee, and finishing with a smokey, resiny finish. Mouthfeel is rich. Overall a good beer, though a bit pricey for my liking considering how much i liked it."
""
"Batch 35 poured into Konings hoeven snifter. Deep black with subtle ruby appearing around the edges. Dark candi sugar on the nose, that distictive belgian note mixed with figgy, carmalized notes and some dark rum. The taste follows soft and nondescript allowing the flavors from the nose to flow over the tongue. If you really rough it up there's a sour note from the burnt candi sugar. What really stands out about this beer is the soft mouthfeel rolling smoothly to an easy finish with no harsh carbination or alcohol burn despite the lingering head."

"I thought this made for a very good winter sipper. I might buy more for aging in the future."
""
""
"O: Really interesting beer - can see why the brewer called it a ""Belgian stout"" - a pretty good mix between the roasted, coffee notes of a stout and the tang from a dark Belgian ale. Good character to have by itself or with spicy or grilled food (can hold it's own against spicy chili)"

"Great mix of a Belgian Triple and a Smokey stout. So light that it almost feels like a schwartzbier. Fruity and phenolic, but smoke and chocolate prevail. Great overall experience."

""
"O/D-Tough to really get a grasp on this one. Had its highs and lows. This one really isn't cut out for me."
""
""
""
"Overall, a very good beer, although not my favorite from Allagash. While I love the appearance and mouthfeel, there are a few distractions in the aroma and the taste, such as the metalic quality. However, my least favorite Allagash beer is still better than most."
""
"Finally, this is a beer I've wanted to try for some time. I was excited to find a single 12oz bottle also. Pours dark chestnut in color with a tall, bubbly, tan colored head, that holds good retention & leaves excellent lacing. Aromas are fruity Belgian yeast, dark malt, slight roast; banana and spice in the background. Tastes are roasty, chocolate, Belgian yeast, banana, dark fruit, chalk, candi sugar. Mouth-feel is very creamy & smooth, medium bodied with nice carbonation. Just what I expect from Allagash - excellent American crafted Belgian ales - I haven't had anything bad from this brewery."
""
"O: An interesting style, one I've been def interesting in trying out more. I like this beer and would like to learn more about its seemingly complex fermentation profile. Didn't see anything on the Allagash website. A well made brew and glad to have tried."
""
""
""
""

""
""
""

"Pours a solid dark brown with garnet highlights when held to light and a huge fluffy beige head that persists forever. I can smell chocolate, caramel, and spicy wheat with a bit of pepper and a hint of oxidation. Light sweet fruits mixed with a bit of yeasty funk and fruitiness round out the nose well. The flavor is chocolate and caramel up front followed by a huge ashy and then oxidized taste that seems odd. Light fruit and yeasty phenols sweep in to mop that up then a chocolatey roasty ashy flavor lingers long into the finish of every sip. Medium body with a high level of carbonation and a sweet bubbly mouthfeel. This one isn't bad, it actually grew on me through the glass, but I'm not sure I'd grab it again."
""
""
""
"It's not offensive but I kind of don't want to finish the rest of the pack. You can tell the skill was there in the separate elements. It's just the overall composition and blending of the elements that was lacking."

"This can come across as a dessert beer, if you wish - accompanying some vanilla ice cream, for example. It's great by itself, too. Doesn't drink heavy nor is it boozy. Very well balanced and not too much going on. Draws from the best qualities of the Belgian dark and Belgian stout styles. Looking forward to having this (over and over) again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is ok, but not something I would have very often. Not a huge fan of the stouts fermented with Belgian yeasts I've had."
"Pours a dark cola brown with a light taupe colored head. Mild smoky chocolate and dark roasted malt on the nose. Mouthfeel is full and smooth. Light notes of chocolate underlie an unoffensive Belgian yeast presence. The entire beer is smooth and very drinkable."
""
""
"Overall a very nice beer. Unique in many aspects and it handles them and very well. The problem is, I had the burbon barrel aged version of this beer which (if I am not mistaken) is my favorite beer of all. So.... this non aged version is very nice but definately get the barrel aged version if you can."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-pretty good stout/dark Belgian. I'd say this is definitely more of a Belgian stout than a BSDA. The flavors aren't very strong. They're subtle and complex. A really decent beer. Something I recommend to go out and try"
""
"O - I really enjoyed this and it was highly drinkable. Smooth and full of flavor"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Unique, yes, but the Belgian yeast is overpowering for me in this one. I like a good stout and a good dark Belgian ale, but this does not seem proportionate in my mind. The stouty aspects are very subtle and I would've liked to have seen more of them present."

"Overall (4.25): Overall, I really dig this little bastard. It really pulls off a mix of American-ish stout characters we all know and love, blended with interesting and somehow not-clashing Belgian characteristics: fruity yeast, fruity malt, moderately bitter coffee and hops, wonderful feel and carbonation, just and excellent blend. Seriously impressed, Allagash."
""
"The best quality is the aroma. an aromatic and floral mix. It has a grape/ ester that carries into the taste. It tastes a hit spicier mixed with the dark malt. It has a very full body compared to the alcohol content overall a nice offering."
"This unique brew - a ""Belgian-style stout"" has a pronounced charred character to it alongside that classic Belgian yeast flavor. It's got a complex nose and palate to be sure, but it is a rather odd taste that some might not be able to get behind. Me, personally, I can't drink a full 12oz. glass of this. Just not to my taste, though I also don't think this style lends itself to general drinkability. Still, I can appreciate what's going on here."
""
""
"This beer melts in your mouth. Sweet chocolate malts with a creamy mouthfeel. Sweet dark Belgian candy sugars upfront followed by an intense roasted character. Finishes with decadent sweet chocolate covered dark fruits, a fine earthy bitterness, and a touch a smoke. The rich body holds up perfectly to the carbonation creating a truly layered flavor experience. So many flavors hide itself in this dark brew including bananas, hazelnuts, plums, and leather. Allagash Black has the drinkability of it's fine Belgian counterparts, with the depth of a classic Russian imperial stout! This is an intense beer!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Taste is phenomenal. Cocoa again, caramel, Belgian yeastiness. Some pleasant wintery spice I can't quite place. Very soft & silky with maybe a hint of oats. But the oats role here is really in the mouthfeel. Outstanding beer."
"O: The first sip doesn't wow me, but it rewards a patient palate with solid complexity. I'd definitely have this one again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Not much belgian presence in this one. With its relative thinness and the presence of a bit of smoke, it's honestly very similar to an english porter more than anything. Not bad though, nice roasted malt and nice balance. Drinkable enough."
""
"Notes: Quite tasty a little bit of a sipper but very drinkable. Cheers."
"The brew poured with a half a finger of tan head that lingered for awhile and left lacing on the glass. The body was a deep black with no visible carbonation. The nose had a lot of roasted malts with a hint of sweetness. The taste was definitely interesting. I got some smoke and definite roasted malts with a hint of Belgian yeast at the end. The body was a moderate thickness with very low carbonation. The alcohol was also really well hidden. The finish lasted awhile with the roasted malts that were apparent in the taste. For me, I enjoyed the brew, but the roasted malts just overwhelmed everything. If I didn’t know that this was an Allagash beer, I wouldn’t be as disappointed. But, this is probably my least favorite brew from them."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Into the black abyss with you! As the label implies, this beer pours like motor oil. Despite the 7.5% alcohol, it feels like a solid kick in the pants. I'm always a fan of a $4 bottle of stone. But if I want to belly up and pay $10+ for a bomber, Allagash is worth every penny."
""

"Serving preparation: I put the bottle in my freezer for about 50 minutes. It was stored at room temp."

"Served from tap into a Trappe Door tulip. Poured a massively dark brown with a three finger very light tan head that subsided to a one finger slowly. Maintained phenomenal lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, roasted malt, dark fruit, wood, fruit, banana, and subtle spice. The flavor was of sweet malt, dark chocolate, roasted malt, fruit, dark fruit, wood, subtle alcohol, and subtle smoke. It had a medium feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a pretty decent brew. There was quite a bit going on in this one that definitely kept the senses guessing on what to expect next. The aroma on this one was definitely the highlight of this one though as it was quite inviting and very nicely balanced with a nice roastiness and fruit profile going on. The flavor wasn’t too far behind, but the dark chocolate profile going on definitely added just a touch more roastiness than was needed in my opinion. Still a solid brew that should not be ignored."
""
"Overall this is nice stout. Allagash does a pretty good job with the beers they produce and this is another I'm really enjoying from them."

""
"O - I enjoyed this beer while sitting in a cabin overlooking Horseshoe Pond in Maine. The setting, along with the beer in the Allagash glass are perfect. I would certainly classify this more as a stout than a BSDA, but it was fantastic regardless of style classification. I highly recommend this beer."

"O: A very nice stout. The dried fruit and the little bit of Belgian yeast funk work well together. Also, the little bit of tart bite nicely balances with the sweetness and the dried fruit."
""
""
""
""
"Very dark copper in color with an off-white head. Sweet caramel and toffee notes with a bit more in the way of roast and chocolate than I usually expect in a quad. Still, decently sweet. The roast and slight coffee flavors are a bit strange, but they work, I suppose. A touch of chocolate along with dark fruit and the usual toffee, caramel, and brown sugar notes."
""
""
""
""
""
"This has decent flavor and a nice body. It's a tad spicy and yeasty, but it has a solid malt character. I will definitely accept this as a ""Belgian Stout"". I'll have this again."

""
"Probably the best I've had by Allagash to date. I'll definitely pick this up again. But the question remains... is this a stout or dark ale!?"

"O: probably my top beer by Allagash, one that I will continue to have"
""
"Overall: very well made, fairly complex. The belgian yeast meshes well and better than I expected with the usual harsher notes of a mildly coffee heavy stout."
"O: I'm a bit fuzzy on whether this is a Stout (per the label) or a Strong Dark, and it seems to straddle both styles. Either way, it's a very pleasant beer and easy to drink."

"Review from 6/2011 notes. Poured into a Black Raven pint glass. Pours a very dark red brown amber with a two finger light tan head and light lacing. Nice aroma of cocoa, coffee, dark malt and dark fruit. Flavorful dark and roasted malt, dark fruits, cocoa; almost like a spiked malted milk. Belgian yeast and spicing is present and well integrated. Slight hop kick at the finish. A complex, great tasting ale or stout with a very nice flavor progression. Medium to creamy body. Impressive."

"Incredible! Just a bit more on the appearance and this is near perfect."

"Beer is medium to light in body, sweet up front, yeasty in the middle, the finish is dry and bitter from the grains, I guess this is suppose to be like a Belgian Stout? Not really enjoying it, not a repeat."

"Black liquid topped by a tan head. Lots of carbonation maintained the foam and nice-looking lace. The aroma has lots of elements, dark fruit, roast malt, belgian yeast adds another element. Nice malt base flavor, grainy but still sweet, slight amount of smoke, cocoa, even some coffee/espresso. Crisp, yet smooth, medium body, dry finish. Complex yet well balanced."

"Overall, a very enjoyable beer, though not a standout. A nice take on the Belgian stout."
"I love stouts, particularly of the imperial variety, and this just doesn't rub me the right way. My beer roots are strongly Belgian, and I suspect I'd have LOVED this brew about 3 years ago. But nowadays, this isn't for me at all. Allagash nailed the style here; it just isn't for me."
""
""
""
""
"Pours an almost opaque murky dark brown with a 1 inch puffy khaki head that settles to a thin cap. Small dots of lace form on the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark malt and Belgian yeast. Taste is of dark roasted malt, burnt coffee beans, and slight yeast flavors. This beer has a higher level of carbonation with a nice crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good Belgian style take on a stout."
"Served up in a snifter this beer is nearly black in the glass the head is thin likely due to a soft pour but the dark khaki colored bubbles around the edge of the glass don't appear to be going anywhere anytime soon. I'll agree with others in that the smell is a bit heavy on the malt for a belgian strong dark ale. However, I'm not going to fault the beer too heavily because i think it works. Malt is the focus in the nose with roasted and chocolate and dark coffee coming through. Below that there is some dark fruit and yeasty esters. The taste follows the smell quite closely with the malt focus clear. Coffee, bittersweet chocolate, roasted malt a bit of caramel and then some bitterness and the yeast. The carbonation is high and bitterness through hops appears relatively low but the coffee like character adds additional bittering. The finish is quite dry and lingers with the coffee character last to leave. Overall this is somewhat of a mix of styles rather than a pure belgian strong dark or I suppose you could just call it an interesting take on that style. Quite good and definitely recommended."

"O: Solid offering, just nothing special. At $3 for 4oz I would say I'm done with this beer, but could see myself getting it again. I quite enjoyed trying it alongside the bourbon version. 3.5"

"O – A very nice change of pace from my standard RIS. I will definitely have to explore more Belgian Stouts in the future."

"Overall: Complex profile, spicy hot dark fruit? A good beer to spend a Saturday with."

"This beer is a little sweet for me, tastes under attenuated. Not bad overall, just be sure you are wanting to drink something on the sweeter side."
""
""
""
"Up front there's a real strong smell of anise. There's a little dark chocolate and some oaky kind of scents in there. Tastes really heavily of dark chocolate and anise with a little coffee suggested in there. Surprisingly sweet for such a burly stout. It has a real rich, creamy mouthfeel and almost no alcohol burn. Afterward your mouth tastes like you just ate some strong dark chocolate, like 80% cocoa."

Solid in all facets, but it is the overall complexity in both scent and flavor that make this one a truly exceptional offering... I can easily recommend this one for fellow BAs and will indulge in future bottles myself as well..."
"O: This is certainly not my favorite Allagash, but it's very good, unique, enjoyable, and approachable. I definitely recommend it."

"Fanatastic beer here. The Belgian style in this stout works particularly well, making for a drinkable, higher ABV beer with plenty of complexity. Definitely one to pick up if you see it."

""
""
""
"D: Although it's an interesting idea to combine a stout and a BSDA in one beer, I find that the mouthfeel doesn't complement the flavors very well. It also tastes much more boozy than it should at 7.5%."

""

"Overall - A strange, but interesting beer. Really bridges the gap between BSDA and stout. Good and interesting, but in the end I'd really like it to be one or the other. The stout gets in the way of the malt character and it's too light in roasted malts to be a stout in itself."
"Overall: Since there is no “Belgian Stout” category, this is listed as a “Belgian Strong Dark Ale”. Make no mistake it is far more the former than the latter. A very nice example of the style, not on-par with Struise stouts but still very good. At the $9.99 a 750ml price it’s also a very good value."

"D - 4.0 - the mildness makes this quite drinkable. The problem is the mildness, which could be described as weakness, combined with the price. It is too expensive to really drink often."

"Edit 3/16/21 - Bumped the scores up a little bit after having another bottle with the same batch number with a bit of a better experience. Smell had much more spice and yeast in it, with the cocoa aspect remaining in the taste. Medium body, high carbonation, but stays fluffy and smooth across the palate."

"O - A great beer. Not overpower, I find it to be very drinkable and flavorful. Not as much belgian influence as I expected. the yeast profile does not come out as much as I thought."

"O - This is probably one of the finest beers I have ever had. I would highly recommend this to anyone, regardless of their taste in beer. I'd consider it a sin not to try this beer. I think the body could have been a bit heavier and if there was a bit more lacing and head retention this would have received a solid A/A+. Those are just tiny things though...in the long run, this beer is wonderful and I'd pay top-dollar for it any day :D 4.5"
"Full-bodied with light carbonation. A good beer overall, though I'm not sure it was really representative of the style."
"O - This was a very nice Belgian strong dark ale. Don't get much of the belgian characters but damn, that chocolate is good."
"Poured into a signature stem glass, Allagash Black was, well, black more or less, with a generous cap of tan head. Listed as a ""Belgian stout"" I didn't completely know what to expect, but the ""Belgian dark ale"" label makes a little more sense after drinking it. Aroma was rich with dark malts, leather and charcoal, with touches of fruit in the background. The taste was similar, and quite complex, with nearly 100% dark maltiness up front, giving way to the leather and charcoal sensed in the aroma, hints of peat and of Belgian yeast, cocoa, and dark fruits coming through near the end. Very interesting. Heavier-medium mouthfeel, rich, and drinkable enough to make me desire another glass right after the first."
"Dr: Very drinkable, and of good quality, but at a high price in California. I'd have it again."
"89."
"A spritzy effervescence fades quickly and a fuller body is revealed. A bit more of the malty sweetness is noticed as it warms."
"This is really a great example of a Belgian-inspired beer that doesn't go overboard on the yeasty and bacterial dosage. Complexity merges with drinkability."
"Pours a dark charcoal black with small cap of desnse khaki froth. Scent is of roasted and charred malts, notes of chocolate and some spice. Taste follows suit, strong roast and char balanced with chocolate, light spice and yeast notes on the background. Finishes dry, medium bodied and quite bubbly. A solid nose and flavor that is only held back by a lighter body and ample carbonation."
"O: This is the first of this style that I've ever tried and I have to say that I don't know if the Belgian yeast qualities blend all that well with those of a stout. It's interesting...but that's where I'd stop. I can easily name about 20 other stouts that I've had that are better than this beer. And can name about 20 Belgian style beers that I've had that I like better. Glad I tried it...wouldn't mind trying again after I've had a few more examples of the style...then revisit this review."
"O: A definite thick sipper that is best for sharing, I enjoyed the malts used in this beer."
"Very smooth with a nice prickly bite after swallowing."
"O - A great brew. Super drinkable yet complex. Everything about it is amazing without any overpowering tones. Pick this one up! Cheers!"
"Pours brown with caramel hued notes, moderate off white head that dissipates to a ring around the glass, not much lace. Smell is fairly roasty, coffee and chocolate, some dark fruits, jam like scents and good amount of belgian yeast. Taste is also fairly roasty, good malt bill, light sweetness, caramel and toffee, dark fruit, raisin and good portion of belgian yeastiness in the finish and aftertaste. Mouthfeel is a little thin, light understated carbonation helps this along, med body. Nice easy drinking stout, alcohol is well hidden and overall its not too heavy feeling."
"Full body, a little higher carbonation, chewy and sticky throughout. Decent Belgo take on the stout, drinkable for the ABV, and an alright balance."
"O: I don't really know about this identity crisis that this beer has. They are going too many directions with this and ruining two styles that are good on their own. I heard this was quite an investment at around $14-15 to boot, no way."
"Pours a cherry kola hue which leaves a bubble laden two finger head and sporadic lacing,the smell is quite subdued for my liking with aromas of dark fruits and dark sweet malts but i dont get much else,the mouthfeel is just medium bodied and creamy and taste is better than smell but not by alot with tastes of dark fruit,sweet malts,a touch of chocolate cherry,a touch of toastiness but not much and finished with a mix of very light coffee and plum jam and overall im not that impressed by this i mean i will drink the bottle and its not undrinkable by any means but it just doesnt have the smell of a BSDA and they say on the bottle its a Belgian style Stout and it doesnt have any characteristics of any stout ive sampled and i would not buy this again cheers."
"This stuff is thin, way over carbonated and doesn't have enough redeeming flavors to save it. Not worth buying. Lately I've been very happy I didn't spend the money on Allagash beers while they were distributed in Ohio."
"Overall I wasn't very impressed, and the price tag was high for what it was (I want to say $14-15 for this 750ml)."
"O: Flavorful and enjoyable. Very drinkable. I will definitely have another."
"O/D: Mellow tasting, and not ""all up in your face"" like other BSDA's. Pleasant to drink, but not something I'd search for."
"O - This is a very tasty Belgian Stout. Allagash always does really good beers."
"O: Enjoyable, Drinkable, have you feeling IRIE upon evacuation, and possibly more special than you know at the moment... ""Solid Brew"""
"The toasty, espresso flavors linger onto the palate with ripe fruit showing up as well. Subtle fig, vanilla, cocoa that swirl with the rich, opulent, creaminess of this superb beer. Excellent, silky finish. I honestly don't know how you could improve this beer. Cheers!"
"Notes: I could see this pairing very well with a woodfire grilled steak."
"o-extremely enjoyable. this is very unique and complex beer. would be perfect served with nice hearty meals or as an after dinner drink. great job again allagash!"
"Very nice stout. I think I'd go for something else first due to the price. Glad I got to rock a bottle though."
"Pours BROWN, dark brown, or maybe black from across the room. Nose has a dark chocolate and coffee aroma. Bitter flavors on the palate, bitter chocolate, hops, some floral and citrus in there, and finishes with a coffee aftertaste that lingers. Also bitter. Light bodied and easy drinking, and surely hides the 7.5% well."
"Overall-I was given this beer so not sure what it costs, probably about 10 bucks. At that price I'm not going to stash up on these, but definitely worth it even now and again."
"Overall, very enjoyable stout."
"Purists will probably criticize the brew for this duality, and it does seem at times like Black is searching for an identity. However, I think the result is interesting, and worth trying--if a little strange. Beware, though: as Black comes with a champagne-style cork (which won't go back in the bottle), it looks like you're going to have to drink the whole thing in one sitting. Darn."
"Pours jet black with a light tan head. In the aroma, a small roast and a small oatmeal like sweetness. In the taste, sweet oatmeal, a small roastiness, and a candy sugar like bite. A small bite and medium bodied mouthfeel, with a lightly dry and roasty aftertaste. A nice roast and small dry hop presence."
"Had this beer many times, never reviewed it, tonight is the night. Very deep dark brown, not yet black, light can make it through. Tan head, fades down to a ring. Not much in the way of lacing. Some aromas of ester-y belgian quality make it through the chocolate and roasted scents. Although faint these two divergent aromas do marry nicely. Strong roasted cacao flavor, roasted barley, some yeast driven fruity notes, more stout like (clearly) then BSDA like. Not overly complex. Full bodied, thick but not syrupy a tad flat. A well presented ale I have enjoyed time and again."
"O - This one seemed more like a smokey porter, but a unique interpretation of a BSDA."
"O: As I said about the taste: it's interesting. The combination of styles is nice, and makes fr a fun drinking experience. That being said, it's far from my favorite beer. The flavors are a little muddled, the carbonation overdone."
"O: One (big) bottle is enough. To drink more, I would need more roast and char to cut the fruity sweetness."
"O- Very good beer. Got this for my birthday and didn't get around to it until now. This is my first offering from Allagash and I am rather impressed. Would higly recommend this one."
"Overall: Excellent. Not your standard big stout. I like it, especially for being different."
"Drinkability – Easy drinking, yet full of nooks and crannies begging to be explored. This is a beer to enjoy in every sense of the word and on any occasion."
"A good example of a Belgian stout. It's not quite up there with what I consider the upper echelon of the breed (e.g. Black Albert) but it's a tasty beer that's priced well."
"O: Amazing beer! One of my favorites and I'll be sad to see this leave TX in bottle."
"This beer poured out just like it's name, Black. The head was fluffy and tan in color. The lacing that was left behind was light and a bit scattered. The smell of the beer was roasted and had some Belgian Yeast peaking through. The taste had a light burnt flavor with a slight sweetness in there too. The other flavors of some soft Belgian Yeast and a little spice come in after the metallic flavor fades by mid glass. The mouthfeel had some decent carbonation to it. Overall I felt this was a pretty good brew."
"overall i'm digging this beer. it's not a world-beater but it's enjoyable and complex. i appreciate the outside-the-box thinking that went into it, transcending styles."
"Its kinda like if you mixed a belgian dubbel with a roasty stout. it works pretty well, but I've never been blown away by this beer. I would like to try the bourbon barrel version of this."
"O: This is a huge beer with a lot of complexities"
"Overall: A very good beer for a warm night or a cold room. Recommend."
"O: this is a very Belgian forward stout, I would prefer it o have a bigger body"
"Very drinkable and nice"
"D - D-licious!! Very smooth! One of my favorites while visiting Maine. If this beer is any indication, I will be seeking out more beer from this brewer."
"M/D: Very dry, but think and smooth. Drinking this beer made me exceedingly thirsty."
"this beer is very well done and has a very rich flavor. hard to explain but it really has a complexity to it while staying light, smooth and quite enjoyable to drink. this is one of my first experiences with Allagash and I am very impressed."
"O - Very good beer, and an excellent take on the BSDA style. One of Allagash's best offerings."
"Overall I found it to be a delicious brew. I've had similar beers that offered something a bit more sweet but this beer makes you feel all warm inside. Perfect drink for a nice cool evening outside by a fire."
"Overall this is an extremely drinkable stout, almost dangerously so, especially as it warmed as you started to take hold of all the notes of prune and dark fruits. Probably the best example of the hybrid style beer and well recommened and will definitely be revisted in the future."
"I'm fairly new to Allagash, but they continue to impress me."
"An excellent example of a style that pretty much fuses two of the greatest things possible."
"Overall this is a wonderful concept beer that is crafted very well. Glad i jumped on a bottle of Allagash while in Cali as i have not seen any on the shelves in Arizona for 5-6 years."
"A good black ale."
"Overall this was a good one, the great combination of stout and Belgian like qualities makes this a great smelling and tasting beer that makes me sad that Allagash is leaving Washington."
"Very good beer!"
"O: Not the best as the body is light and the phenol is too heavy. High Allagash prices are a turn-off too, but this is still a solid brew, just not destined to be a favorite."
"D/O - Drinkability is moderate. While the Belgian influence is a welcome change in a style I've had my fair share of, it's not exactly brimming with flavor and the mouthfeel is a bit of a disappointment. I would've loved to see this be a bit fuller in the mouth."
"D: Pretty drinkable... interesting flavors... nothing too crazy, but good."
"Pours a pitch black with little to no head forming. Almost no lacing present. The beer smelled of chocolate, roasted malt, molasses, and coffee. Taste was about the same as the smell, strong chocolate and coffee notes. Almost no carbonation was present and the mouthful was extremely thin. Overall an average beer."
"O - Good offering from Allagash. Quality Belgian style brews always."
"Deep black in body with off-white bubbly head that leaves behind some lacing. Aroma of chocolate nibs, raspberry, grapes, slight cola. Eclectic flavor including cola, Belgian candy sugar, subtle cocoa, warming booze, grapes, hop bitterness and mint to finish the drink. Medium bodied with high carbonation. A delicate but assertive beer that is one of a kind."
"O- A very good BSDA hybrid. Enjoyable and nice to drink. Worth trying if your a fan of Belgians and/ or stouts."
"O: A bit surprising. I've passed on bottles of this in the store a few times, but glad I tried this on draft. It has all the right flavors, just mellowed out, but I liked that for the occasion."
"From the pour it separates itself from its bigger odyssean brother - a little bit thicker and lacking some of the carbonation. A little muddier as well with less uniformity. A thin layer of almost roasted brown head rests on top. Smells like cocoa, vanilla and sweet malt. Taste is much of the same, with more dark fruit and a complex body. Kind of unsure of itself, honestly, like it could have gone one of many directions a little bit further. Still an awesome brew, and maybe it's just that lack of commitment to one ostentatious note that makes it such a stable, staple beer. Really, I just shouldn't drink it alongside the Odyssey. Very laid back beer here. Can't wait to force it out of a tap one day."
"I'm a stranger to Belgian Strong Dark Ale and thought I'd give Allagash Black a try at Rattle N Hum-NYC on 4.12.11. Into a large tulip glass, it certainly lived up to its name with its color. What impressed me most about this was the full flavored yet delicate mouthfeel that prominently displays its roasted coffee and cocoa malt notes without losing its smooth texture. Carbonation was held back just enough for flavors to shine through. There is certainly a Belgian yeast signature in the finish blended with a light ground coffee taste...Black and White, Allagash continues to intrigue me..."
"Overall, I'll give this a B+. Not my favorite style but interesting nonetheless."
"Overall - This is combination of two great beer styles. While the Belgium end takes a bit of a back seat to the Stout-ness; this is a very well brewed beer."
"On tap at a beer festival poured into a sampler glass. From notes: Pours a near black with a nice, off-white to tan head that leaves behind a pretty good amount of lacing. Aroma is nice and strong, bringing forth some Belgian yeast esters along with some roast, dark fruits, bitter chocolate, and a whiff of espresso. Taste is similar but not quite as complex, with many of the roast aspects taking over the more delicate flavors. Mouthfeel is nice and full enough for the flavors."
"Overall - I could pick up on the alcohol and the beer gave me a nice warming feeling in my chest. I was a little disappointed with the appearance, but the beer had a nice taste and would work very well as a winter warmer. It's worth seeking out."
"O: This beer is relatively easy to drink because the alcohol is well hidden. The taste is very balanced and the flavors intensify as the beer warms up."
"D: pretty damn drinkable but had a nice belgian twist to it. I'd drink some again."
"This beer had all the makings of an Imperial Stout with just a subtle hint of Belgian spices. Big smoky, chocolate flavor up front, with roasted nuts and spices following. Very minimal hop presence, but it didn't detract from the experience. SLight dark fruit flavor as well. Mouthfeel was a touch on the thin side. Overall I really enjoyed this one. Not quite Belgian, not quite RIS, but very enjoyable."
"Allagash Black has a black (duh) colour with a good head and excellent lacing. The smell is quite yeasty with some notes of bitter chocolate. The taste is malty with some raisins and coffee notes. It ends with a delicious roasty Belgian-yeasty finish. The texture is frothy and excellent. This is a very nice strong dark ale."
"O (D) - Drinkable for sure, a pretty good and interesting beer."
"O: This is a very well crafted beer. Happy to see Allagash making more and more delicious beers. Just wish my pocket book could handle them."
"Good beer with higher marks for being easy to sip & velvety than anything else. Solid Belgian stout in a distinctly Allagash style."
"T-"
"D: Seems easy to drink since none of the flavors are too overbearing. The alcohol is fairly well hidden. In general, this is a good beer that I might purchase again if I come across it."
"Feels alright; kind of dry to finish, coarse carbonation with a medium body. Not my favorite of the style. I guess I'd just rather have a Belgian."
"All told a nice beer. Belgian flavor is a little less pronounced than I would like, but it is nice to see how the yeast can effect this type of beer."
"Belgian styles are always a favorite and to have the dark dark strength of this black makes it something special."
"Drink- It's good and tasty. The malts are well balanced and smooth. Glad I saw this being raved about in a thread so of course my interest was piqued."
"This is one of my favorites from Allagash. The balance is very interesting. It's like a hybrid between a Belgian dark ale and an American stout. The beer is tasty to begin with, and it gets better with age."
"D- is superb and very easy to drink for a stout..but huge flavor profile in this one"
"D - Goes down easy and is very pleasant. A joy to drink. Savor it! A great combination of styles that exhibits some brilliant flavors."
"Notes: The beer is marketed as a ""Belgian Style Stout."" It's definitely a hybrid type of beer, but IMO it falls more on the Stout side of the line than the Belgian side."
"i can't say i've ever had a finer beer!"
"On cask (with cocoa nibs added) during Flying Saucer Raleigh's 11th anniversary served in a standard pint glass a deep not quite opaque black with a barely there head that diminishes to a ring. Aroma is slight cocoa and spice. The taste is a nice amount of smooth cocoa in front of dark malts and mild dried fruits. The beer is medium bodied and is very smooth and easy drinking. This is a very enjoyable Belgian beer, one I would love to have on cask again."
"Verdict: Although lacking in one area, it is delicious and worth tracking down."
"D - Very drinkable. Silky smooth and asks for another sip. As I was tasting this I kept thinking I had already tasted a similar beer, and finally remembered the taste from Basha by Stone/BrewDog. The style of this beer is a Belgian Stout but the body being as thin as it is, and the hops being fairly prevalent, make it almost a Black IPA. Belgian Black IPA is what Basha is. Both are very good and I would definitely buy this again."
"D: If this were just a teensy bit less carbonated, i would call this a perfect brew. Still an A in my book though, for sure."
"Drinkability: My favorite Allagash to date. Nice and complex. Love the roasted malt taste with the Belgian spicyness. The combo works really well. A sipper, but one I would come back to."
"I'm fairly new to the craft brew scene and this is my first Belgian Stout so I probably don't know what the hell I'm talking about... wasn't bad, reminded me of a Black Ale, I'd give it another shot."
"D- other than the thin mouthfeel that isnt right on a stout, this was a very enjoyable beer. something id like to sample again. maybe an older bottle next time. another success from allagash. lots of flavor packed into a beer without too much alcohol."
"Another happy discovery at The Grille Room in Portland, Maine, this one's a dark black color, as one might expect, with mahogany edges and a big tan head not to mention fair lacing. The aroma brings light charcoal chocolate hints and maybe a touch of grassy hops. The flavor brings herbal hop and subtle juniper malt and charcoal. Very nice blend and a very pleasant, near velvetty feel with subtle carbonation. This has a beautiful grain hop mix that is pretty drinkable and just pleasantly tasty. Almost a bit of a Christmas beer. Very nice stuff and highly recommended."
"Notes: While nothing memorable this is a good brew, and I would not mind to pick it up again. Some of the special release Allagash brews feel far more remarkable and not that far away in pricing but quite a level up in quality."
"My second offering from Allagash, had the Witte a while back. I really enjoyed this and will have to seek out more of their beers."
"D- High drinkability. Allagash Black is one helluva a beer and will change your perception as to what a dark beer can be like. Dark beers generally inspire masculinity and typical robust roasted flavor. Allagash Black has all the characteristics of a stout but is somehow delicate, feminine and graceful."
"D- Complex but slightly dry. Very good overall. A sipper."
"Unique and interesting twist on the stout. Subtle and sublime, unlike so many others. Smooth, rich, tasty, and easy to sip. ... Roasty character becomes more prominent with time. I suspect the yeast is the main reason this is so unique. Meets Allagash's high standards, even if it doesn't have the reputation (and price tag) of the others."
"jd"
"An extremely dark and complex stout. Great for sipping over an extended period of time. There were also some fleeting floral herb notes in this beer, but I could not pinpoint at which stage I was tasting them. It's a very fine offering from Allagash. Recommend."
"Nicely done."
"Finish is just a tiny bit sweet with bitter chocolate. Overall, a very unique beer."
"I'm reviewing this as a BSDA, since that's what it is classified as on BA. As a ""Stout," (as the bottle clearly states) it would score substantially lower. I suppose that's the flexibility when brewing these Belgian Interpretations. Still, a nice beer."
"belgian style export stout with a uncanny similarilty to some new wave belgian forms. mild sweet blackish brown look with some murkiness. nose of something quite doughy though. doughy overall. with some malty chocolate toast and some mineral finish that doesn't leave too much linger."
"D- An exceptional sipping beer. I'm fully hooked, especially being one of Allagash's more affordable beers.(Paid $7.99)"
"D - If it looks like a stout, smells like a stout, and tastes like a stout...then it must be a stout! Very delicious and complex."
"I'm appreciating that Allagash did not try to be extreme here. The abv isn't extreme, the yeast isn't extreme, none of the flavors are extreme."
"Drinkability is good an enjoyable experience maybe not best cost to enjoyment ratio but defiantly worth having if you haven't."
"Notes: This isn't so much a Belgian style in my opinion, but a stout. Either way it's a damn good beer and great on tap. Recommended."
"I liked the complexity and would have again on an occasional basis."
"Overall a good stout. Another solid product from Allagash...seems to be a trend."
"This would have been great if it had some sort of fruit or estery component on the nose or taste but it doesn't. Very dissapointing I don't care for it at all."
"Pours real dark, close to actual black. Substantial creamy foaming of a about 2-3 inches. Mild nose for a stout with hints of yeast and sugar. Very smooth mouthfeel with moderate carbonation. Tastes of malts, cocoa, fudge and sugar with no one dominant flavor. Not overwhelmingly chocolaty like others; just an exceptional blend of tastes."
"d. good, nough said i think. its a nice beer, easy to drink and exhibits pleasant belgian properties."
"Even at its medium price range, it was something definitely worth while drinking"
"Conclusion: I liked where this beer was trying to go. I thought it was very interesting. I wouldn't discourage anyone from trying this, but for me it was not entirely my pint of beer. More than likely I will give this another chance - it did have a flavor that was worth exploring again."
"D: Very flavorful and balanced. Rich, but not thick or filling. Disguises the alcohol well."
"Pours a blackish body with soapy tan head that died quick but left a lace ring. A very malty/hearty aroma of chocolate, oak/wood, roasted malts, a little alcohol in the nose. A solid yeast aroma as well and a little bit of orange/citric feel (hints of bread, figs, black cherry and maple are all scents one might pick up). Typical meal in a bottle as a medium-bodied beer passes that is smooth and creamy and yet also has a stickiness on the back end. Has a large sweet malt base of cocoa, vanilla, caramel, candy sugar. Also a roasted, touch of coffee, malt base for balance so it not only has sweetness but a dry edge around the beer. A nice citric sharp twang along with some fruit falvors like black cherry and a noticeable orange taste (possible grapeskin taste as well). The moderate ABV hides itself well and this is like a mixture of a sweet stout and a Belgian ale and it is done very nicely; must-try for anyone."
"Overall, what was best about this brew was how well it keeps to its name. The look fit, the aroma was spicy and robust, and the flavors were perfectly attuned to a beer with the name of ""Black""."
"Cheers..."
"D: Its not a beer you drink all night by any means but it goes down very smooth. Heavier body, but goes down very, very smooth."
"I picked this brew up at The Belfast Co-Op in Maine. Poured from the caged and corked bottle into 2 small snifters. (One for myself and one for my wife.) Poured a dark black color with a burnt tan color head. An amazing array of scents the Belgian yeast, and some burnt charcoal smells and minor dark fruits. Smooth mouthfeel, very easy to drink. First to hit the tip of my tongue is the malt, then a fruity dark bitter chocolate flavor. I am comfortable sipping on this sniffer. having split the 750 ml bottle."
"Very good"
"Taste is along the same lines as the nose along with some licorice, sassafras and herbal hop flavors. Has a relaxing feel to it and goes down easy. Mouthfeel is not as creamy and viscous as I would like, but not too big of a deal. Carbonation is higher like a Belgian Strong Pale as opposed to a stout. I am pleased the yeast esters add something unique to the beer. And it is not really a fruity aspect, more of a bready, zesty spice character. It's a good beer, I'd probably buy another one. Might be a good candidate for the cellar too."
"D: Goes down easily, nice kick, nice representation of style, a touch less carbonation would be nice, but a damn fine beer that I would easily get again."
"D: This is a very unique and enjoyable brew."
"I look forward to trying this beer again and changing my review."
"Poured into a Ommegang chalice black with a thin off white head. Bottle says Batch #7. It's allergy season and I can't smell much of anything. I do find a hint of belgian yeast in the nose. The taste is almost like a Black IPA with belgian yeast. Dark carmel malts with a hint of a hop bitterness. Then the belgian yeast adds to a complexity. Mouthfeel is a little thin in body for my likes to such a dark brew. But that really doesn't take much away from this being a really good dark ale."
"D: Excellent Belgian style brew, and great for sipping."
"Drinkability: Quite potable, could easily drink 1500 MLs of this stuff hides its 7.5 ABV well."
"I would say this would be a great bottle to share with friends who enjoy other complex beers. This is by no means a session beer, that would just be a waste of such a robust offering. Do yourself a favor, buy two bottles, drink one now and put one in your cellar for a year or two!"
"Pours a pitch black color with a thick white head and a generous ton of lacing. Smells of dark fruits such as figs, plums, and even prunes with sweet malts. Tastes of figs and plums, sweet malts, sweet chocolate, toffee and caramel. Mouthfeel is thick and satisfying. Drinkability is really great."
"Most Belgian stouts I've had have a creamier mouthfeel, this is a bit thinner than that. The spicy, dray finish makes for a nice aftertaste. That allows for some easy drinking."
"Very complex. You could drink this 10 times and not figure out everything. Just a well crafted brew. The elegant body matches the complex flavors. This is a world class beer."
"I think this is pretty drinkable, but maybe not as much as the bottled version is. I can see myself finishing an entire 750ml bottle, but I'll be fine with just one glass of the cask'd variety. I would recommend trying this one if you saw it available, especially if you're a fan of Allagash."
"Pours a near black with a nice, off-white to tan head that leaves behind a pretty good amount of lacing. Aroma is nice and strong, bringing forth some Belgian yeast esters along with some roast, dark fruits, bitter chocolate, and a whiff of espresso. Taste is similar but not quite as complex, with many of the roast aspects taking over the more delicate flavors. Mouthfeel is nice and full enough for the flavors. Very nice beer on cask; I'd love to encounter more Belgian-style brews in this manner."
"D: High"
"D- I could sip on this all night long!"
"D: Exceptional, I could definitely drink more than one."
"D - Good, but couldn't do more than one."
"Pours a great head. Tan, big, lots of staying power and tons of lace. The beer is pitch black. Can't even see through it when I hold it up to the light. The first smell is coffee, currants and charcoal followed by sweet roasted malts. The beer velvety smooth and delicious. The flavor has everything that was in the aroma and then some. All of the dark and roasted flavors are accompanied by hints of vanilla and dark fruits. This beer is amazing and right now I'm regretting that I gave my half the other half of the bottle."
"A top pick for the style, and with each sip Black is turning into our current favorite from Allagash."
"Overall: Overall the beer was very good. If delivered on all fronts. I would highly recommend this beer to ANY beer drinker. Well done."
"In the battle of North American takes on the Belgian Stout style, I'd still pick Ommegang for its refined dusty cocoa flavour, but this is a damn close race, and Allagash have made another excellent beer. My only complaint is that the nose could do with a bit more zip, as it lest down an otherwise impeccable brew."
"Overall a perfectly balanced beer that i could see would improve even more so on oak. The only criticism i have is the carbonation but it can be easily overlooked. Could drink a lot of this."
"Not as impressed with this beer as I thought I'd be. I'm not sure if I didn't give it a good pour, but their was almost no head to it. The smell was of maple, coffee, and bitter chocolate. The taste was similar, with a more syrupy, burnt toffee flavor. It was a lot like Dogfish Head's Chicory Stout. I was hoping for a sweeter flavor, but it wasn't coming through - even when the beer warmed. On a more positive note, I think the bottle (label) is sexy as hell!"
"The finish is dry and malty, and also very appetizing. I definitely enjoyed this stout, and I think it has a lot of unique characteristics valuable to a stout which you don't often see in one. Try it with roast beef, shepherds pie, or herbed goat cheeses. It would also be delicious with ice cream, cookies, or fruit cake."
"Smooth and medium consistency, the carbonation is a bit low for a Belgian, but it gives it a very creamy finish. Hardly feels like the 7.5% ABV that it is, I could enjoy this whole bottle with no trouble at all."
"From the 750 ml. corked bottle marked 1050-19:49. Sampled on August 14, 2010. It pours a handsome mahogany brown with ruby red hues glimmering around the glass. The head is a delicate, silky tannish color. Yeast, malts, cocoa, and spices highlight the well-balanced and inviting aroma. The body is rather bold but the fluffy head tickles the lips. The taste is a well-balanced combination of malts, wheat, and yeast with a little hoppiness around the edges to give it a little zing. A wonderfully well-rounded beer."
"Notes: A tasty brew and I like the new pricing a lot better! Drinkability suffers due to its heft and spiciness."
"Not an overly drinkable beer, I was hoping for a little more in the flavor and complexity of the beer, still a solid offering, not something I would look for again though."
"Nice beer. Not as big as anticipated. Poured with a nice sized light tan foamy frothy head and lots of lace. Color is a very dark, almost opaque brown, with dark cherry highlights. Aroma is roasty, bitter, old leather, dark wood. Flavor is quite different and mild. I'm drinking this colder than recommende. It is a stout, but quite mild and not like any other Belgian stout I've had. Body is ok but the carbonation is perhaps a bit fizzy. Finiish is like flavor and short."
"Very luscious texture set off by a a nearly chalky finish. You can feel the booze at the very end."
"D - solid all around, excellent example of a Belgian-influenced stout. nice and robust but not too extreme."
"D - I am looking forward to the rest of this big bottle!"
"D- big and roasty but this stuff on a hand pump is a revelation. Very good."
"A good tasting beer but I was pretty much done with it by the end of the glass, probably wont go back."
"This is exactly how I'd expect a Belgian Stout to taste. It's like a 50/50 of stout and Belgian dark. Allagash pulls off another well made ""Belgian American""."
"Overall, this is an excellent take on the style - one definitely worthy of a case - should you be fortunate enough...now to enjoy what little remains..."
"This is an absolute must try for any craft beer fan. If you are really into Belgian style brews and are a fan of dark brews, this will turn your head after the first sip. I want to pound this, but I have to sip and savor. Yet another top shelf brew from Allagash. Excellent stuff from an excellent brewery."
"F: Semi bitter, lingering earthy roasted malts and some bitterness. Chewy malts with lingering chocolate roast and milk, fluffy nougat still there, with a little roasted barley lingering. A touch of sticky sweetness, but a light dryness."
"Not much stout to this stout. It's good but doesn't live up to the Allagash name. Speaking of which, Allagash hasn't been living up to their price tag as of late."
"It drinks like a blend of porter and a brown. I'm not sure any characteristics stood out as stellar, but I love the Belgian yeast aspect blended with the American stout characteristics that I love. All-in-all it's enjoyable. I like it even better on tap."
"Consumed: 6/16/2010"
"Delicious. Pours very dark, with a bit of a reddish tint in the glass. Aroma is mostly coffee with some hint of Belgian yeast. Taste is rick and complex: a strong coffee flavor (I can taste roasted malts) and some fantastic dark chocolate undertones. There's some bitterness at the end...the hops are represented as well. This beer has a nice middle-ground carbonation and a wonderful mouthfeel. Not at all syrupy like an imperial stout, but plenty of body to give this a very full mouth experience. Once again, delicious."
"Mouthfeel is full bodied, yeasty, astringent, and lip smacking. A mild touch of cinnamon, nutmeg, and vanlla."
"This beer pours dark brown with a nice two finger tan head. lots of fizzing.(doesn't retain ead very long.) smells like malts, chocolate, hops. Tastes dark chocolate, bitter, woody, roasted coffee. decnt mouthfeel with a bitter finish. nice delayed alcohol effect. a pretty good offering."
"On tap at the Portland Lobster Co. restaurant this past weekend. Dark brown color to the body, almost black. Not as much head as I would have liked to have seen. Nice roasted coffee smell. Taste was a lot like a nice stout, but much more subtle. There was a nice combination of chocolate, cocoa, and roasted barley, but the mouthfeel was a lot more smoother than a normal stout. Also, the abv was in a manageable range, so it was an easy beer to drink. I like this beer because it satisfied the stout lover in me, but hit the spot for a nice dark ale with my meal. A unique offering from Allagash."
"D - If this is the style that I am looking for I want this. Well done and will have again."
"Pours black (go figure) with ruby highlights and big, pillowy tan head. Smells of malt & yeast, like toasted dark bread. Somewhat thin in the mouth at first, but a quick swish brings the natural carbonation to life. Tastes of roasted dark malt, espresso, and yeast. A very well crafted beer, but it doesn't really excite me."
"Opinion: I am really enjoying this beer. It has a nicely presented malt profile along with plenty of carbonation and a reserved Belgian yeast character. That said, I am not sure how much I will be drinking this one in the future as there isn't a whole lot about it that stands out to me. I believe that I paid around $10 for this bottle, which is about the same price as a St Bernardus Abt12. I would drink it if it was more budget friendly but as it is I will be sticking to some other staple beers. I would recommend it to try...to see what happened if an Irish brewer got stuck in Belgium..."
"D - this beer is very approachable. The drinkability is great due to the 7.5 being hidden and the fact that the beer doesn't have any off favors."
"D: Nice to try, but would likelt not seek out again."
"Taste: Intense medium level roastiness permeates everything. Has a delightful roast quality that, for me, is step up from the roastiness in most dark beers. Semisweet and oaky in the middle with some rich, raisiny fruits but not super exciting. Finish is semidry with beautiful roast cocoa, caramelized oaky malts, a pinch of ripe fruits"
"Overall pretty good. It worked but needed to be a little fuller and well rounded to really make an impression."
"I am continually disappointed w/ allagash brews. I don't like the allagash white and I feel the same about the black. For an $11 bomber, it is really boring. There are so many cheaper stouts that I enjoy far more than this one. It lacked flavor and was over-carbonated. After I let it sit for a little while it improved a little, but I would not recommend this to anyone."
"D: A nice, strong sweet bracer for a night out, or a good dessert accompaniment to a roast or BBQ fowl dinner. At 7.5% ABV, it's not like you'd pick up a bomber for yourself all that often. Good for what it is, but I'm unlikely to get it again."
"D: It is a bit heavy, as would be expected, but certainly goes down easy and you can easily drink a lot of this in a short period of time. We actually had it with Corned Beef over St. Patrick's Day weekend and it was a nice substitute for a Guinness."
"Drinkability is good. At 7.5%, this is about the perfect strength to enjoy a bomber of. There is enough depth of flavor for enjoyment, but not enough to really wow me. Overall this is a fine beer and one and I would happily drink again."
"Really much more of a stout that a Belgian Strong Dark Ale, and I assume this is exactly what Allagash was looking for. Some of the Belgian yeasty character comes through behind the roasty sweetness, and it all works very well together. Recommended."
"Not bad, like most Allagash beers this is very solid. Though, like most Allagash beers this is nothing all that exceptional either. Still very much worth a try."
"Pours a nice dark color (befitting the name) into a goblet. The head is a soft coffee color. There is only about an inch of head which does not last very long. The aroma is rather pleasant, being full of malts and coffee and toffee. The taste is coffee, malty, and not bad. The mouth feel is thick and rich. Certainly a stout to give a try. While I may not rush out drink this again in the near future, I certainly would not turn it down if offered to me. I hope to taste this beer on tap."
"can't wait to start grilling and try this with some steaks or burgers, I can tell the darker flavors would be great with any grilled beef with BBQ sauce. absolutely worth seeking out."
"Will definately get this again and I suggest you do too!"
"Drink this beer after dinner on a cold night with a friend. I can't wait to get back to the US to get more of this!"
"The aroma is faint, dark malts and dark sweet fruits, a little alcohol. Flavor, is also as expected, 'belgian style stout' describes it very well. Dark roasted malts are predominant but not overpowering. The flavor is balanced with a malty fruity sweetness. Chocolate and spices are in the background. Flavor is very smooth and balanced. Carbonation is high. Very drinkable."
"D: This beer is big on flavor and not real heavy so drinkability was good. Allagash hits this style very well. Another one of their great beers!"
"mmm boy. Never wanted to spend the $$ on this one, but if I see it again ina store, i'll pay the price. This was part of a beer dinner at the Charlotte Liberty Gastropub. Enjoyed this as part of a second course, with Cocoa Nib Crusted Yellow Fin Tuna with Braised Pork""Sheppard's Pie"" and Irish Rose Potato-Herbed Goat Cheese Crust. I'm not sure I undertood the pairing, but by itself, this was world class. Nice subtle fruit notes, very easy to consume, and a solid medium body. Will get this again"
"Mouthfeel is full and smooth from the oats, but also features very lively carbonation, a foamy overall mouthfeel."
"D: rather easy, find myself taking bigger and bigger sips."
"Overall Impression: This is billed as a Belgian Stout, and it delivers. It has the body and mouthfeel of a Begian Ale, with the chocolate/roasted malt/coffee flavors of a stout in addition to some subtle flavors associated with Belgians. Yet another winner from Allagash!"
"For me, this beer was meant for a cask. The flavor is bright and spicy enough not to be dulled into too-rich thickness. The balance you end up getting from the taste is sublime."
"d - Overall I enjoyed this quite a bit. The smell was a very interesting Stout/Belgian mix, and the taste was more of a stout, even though it was surprisingly light. Pretty good and I'd definitely try it again."
"I would probably buy it again. ($11 in NH)"
"Smell and taste develop interestingly as it airs and warms. I find myself adding aspects to my description as it intensified. Very enjoyable."
"D: Not half bad. My first Belgium style stout. Similar to other stouts but a bit more porter like. This wasn't my favorite stout but there was certainly nothing wrong with it. I'd recommend giving it try."
"D - A bit light and on the thin side for me. When I want a stout I want something with body and a thick mouth feel. I feel like this would be a nice beginner stout"
"Overall an interesting belgian take on a familiar style."
"This was a let down."
"D - I was skeptical from the aroma, but the flavor is very nice. More ""porter"" than ""stout"""
"D: Very drinkable and good complexity. What I would imagine if a good dry irish stout was mixed with a darker belgian brew. Seek it out if you are a fan of either--or especially both--styles. Good sessionability."
"O: solid beer, good roast/toast balance"
"Over all I would re-label this beer as Allagash Black Belgium feeling American Porter. This beer is worth the try, but a $14.99 for a 750mL, I'm gonna shy away from buying this one again for a while."
"Pours dark brown to black with a khaki head. There are red highlights around the edges. The aroma is roasted malt, chocolate and Belgian yeast. The flavor is more roasted malt and chocolate, with some Belgian character. You get some bitterness and possibly even some coffee characteristics. The mouthfeel is very creamy with low carbonation."
"The drinkable aness of this is great, it's not to high in alcohol and the body is not extremely thick weighing you down halfway through. I could of did the bomber to the head easily. Not very complex in taste but the balance is the tits. This is good as a small sipper over a night or you could gulp it a bit more and not feel like a glutton. The only thing that's wrong is the name, perhaps Rob could call this Allagash Off Black."
"It has a full, smooth chocolate cake-like mouth feel. There is a definite sense of strength in the back of the mouth but it is not disruptive to the enjoyment of the flavor. It is very drinkable and is an excellent example of two very traditional styles merged to create something luscious and unique."
"D: What keeps me coming back to the glass is the combination of belgian flavors with the large roasty body. Interesting mix, but not too drinkable."
"On a side note, a bit of this beer spilled on my shirt and stained almost instantly. It'll probably come out in the wash but looks really gross for the time being. Careful sipping."
"3.5/3.5/3.5/3/4"
"Mild carbonation, medium body, smooth as silk...flavors of Belgian yeast, oats, roasted malts, and dark candy. Once again, I'm picking up notes of chocolate. Very tasty Belgian style stout. Just another great beer from Allagash."
"Very drinkable. As it gets closer to room temp, the bitterness takes more of a center stage. This does not completely fight of the sweet chocolate, or the coffeeish flavor. If you have it in a bomber, try a chalice slightly chilled, and another a bit warmer, and you will notice some serious differences. Not sure which is better, but I am leaning toward room temp on this one."
"D- Borders the line between Belgian Dark and Imp. Stout. Not on my short list, but worth another bottle."
"Overall, I was disappointed by Allagash's efforts on this offering. While this beer is unoffensive, it is hardly memorable. I would compare it more to a mediocre American stout than a quality Belgian strong dark ale."
"Notes: Allagash continues to impress with this really nice beer."
"Drinkability: The usual for Allagash --- excellent. Slow sipper. Would be excellent with gamey meats, beef roasts, or an after dinner drink in lieu of dessert. I'd find it again."
"Poured on the warm side this beer is solid black with ruby on the edges and a thick and tight 3-finger khaki head. The aroma is sour Belgian funk on top of a layer of wonderful stout coffees, chocolates, and roasted malts. The flavor is sweet like brown sugar at first followed by a wallop of roasted malts (coffee, chocolate) which then displays Belgian funk but lingers with chocolate. Some alcohol comes through as well, but juuust barely. The mouthfeel is medium in body and carbonation."
"PS. Guiness has alot to learn!"
"750 mL Belgian bottle, batch #6, purchased at the brewery. Brewed with German 2-row, oats, torrified wheat, roast malts, dark candi sugar and their house Belgian strain; bottle conditioned. It pours near solid black, with an inch of almost fluffy, tan head that doesn't leave much lacing. Nice chocolatey roastiness in the nose, steely, with a drop of licorice. It gives the impression of an oatmeal or Irish stout. Similar in flavor, but it tastes a bit sharp, minerally?, with prevalent green hops that impart a medium bitterness. Not incredibly Belgian at first, but after some time to breathe it picks up a bit. It has a well-attenuated medium body that at times pushes to thick, with very fine carbonation and a dry finish. The beer comes across as a mishmash of styles at first, but it does improve a bit. Good, but not great, just make sure not to drink this one too cold."
"Draft at Sierra. Great color and nose. Pours a jet black color with tan head. Looks like a big stout, but I keep reminding myself its not. Aromas are big coffee roasted almost heavier than what I know the palate feel to be. Mouthfeel leads it to be higher than 7.5 but overall a great smooth flavorful beer. I'd kill to try the BA version as I think the bourbon would blend into this one very well and to see the alcohol increase."
"D: Pretty good, kind of what I expected from Allagash. I don't think I've had anything offered by the brewery that I haven't liked at least somewhat. Not as heavy as it would appear to be, but still not something I would drink for hours on end. Good once in a while for sure."
"Over all this is a very drinkable beer. I wish I had another but I don't."
"Cheers!"
"Pours opaque black with faint coffee. Not as aromatic as I would think it would be, but maybe I'm a little stuffy. Tan head that clears quickly, but leaves lots of lacing on the glass. Watery taste up front, almost like a tap water taste. It gets better as it gets to the middle and back palette. Coffee with roasted malt. Kind of disappointing, for something in the 95th percentile I expected good flavor and mouthfeel across the whole palette. This didn't deliver, but I will probably revisit it to be sure."
"This beer is easy to drink, I could put away quite a few with ease."
"Overall, not a bad beer. This is my first foray into Allagash, and I wasn't expecting much. Of all the Allagash brews I have in the cellar (various trades, but mostly from Ryan!) I figured this one would benefit the least from aging, so I thought I would give it a shot and wasn't expecting anything too great. Nevertheless I was impressed. It doesn't really pull off the ""Stout"" as much as I would have liked, but it's still a good Belgian Strong Dark Ale."
"Drinkability: I was very thankful I had only a glass, and not a bomber, of this one."
"This is a dark beer, but no nearly as dark and thick as other stouts. It has a nice off white head that leaves some nice lacing. There is not much going on in the nose; mostly clove, some Belgian spiciness and a hint of chocolate. There is not much going on in the flavor department either. Mostly spicy with some chocolate and a touch of coffee and the slightest hint of dark fruits. The flavors come through as it gets warmer. It seems over carbonated. It is drinkable beer, though I doubt I will ever purchase it again. This is my second beer that blurs the line between being a Belgian beer and a stout and its the second time I've been disappointed. I think I will just stick to drinking either a RIS or a standard Belgian beer, not something attempting to be both."
"Dark brown colored beer with a slowly fading creamy head.Aroma is malty.Taste is malts with hints of chocolate and coffee.Overall drinkable and smooth with a hint of warmth on the back end.This is something I would recommend especially in the winter months.I'm sure I will buy this again somewhere down the line."
"D: I think I paid $10 for this, which isn't offensive. But the beer is kind of mediocre. I could go either way on having it again."
"Overall, I find this to be an enjoyable beer. Allagash has managed to put a nice spin on the typical stout by giving it some Belgian like qualities. Make sure you let this one warm up a bit, because it does become somewhat more complex."
"I haven't had many Belgian strong darks, but this fits the bill enough for me. A solid offering."
"It is silky and warm feeling on the tongue you can also feel the alcohol along with the carbonation. At 7.5 it's a bit too much for a session beer but the flavours are mellow and complex."
"Pours a truly black color, even when held up to the light only a faint ruby glow barely peeks out of the edges, a small brown head sits a top the abysmal brew leaving lots of sticky lace. Creamy, long roasted malts, coffee notes, hints of chocolate and a fruity Belgian-like yeast characteristic in the nose. Spicy, a heat like in some chili beers ive had sits on the tongue, i love it, creamy, smooth and silky in texture, light and well carbonated. An awesome beer, although ive never had a Belgian Stout that tasted quite like this one, this beer goes above and beyond. A good balance of flavor and sweetness, id actually coin this one as more dry than the average stout, although the stickiness on the lips is undeniable. The 750ml is an ideal serving, i dont see it becoming a chore any time soon. Recommended."
"As with all Allagash stuff I've had so far, this is above the norm while also seeming sensible, drinkable, made with love, and all the rest. Solid, solid, solid...a word that comes to mind every time I have something from this brewery."
"D=Easy to drink if you like dark beer. I can't wait to take another sip."
"Don't drink and review."
"Overall this was an enjoyable beer. The BSDA category covers a lot of different type beers, but this one is squarely a Belgian Stout. A very enjoyable beer, I recommend to all."
"Overall-a fine beer, and a success. Nice job here."
"Super beer. Carbonation could be a little smoother, given the style comparison to Rochefort 8 for example. But that's an awfully high standard, and this one tastes terrific."
"While this is well-crafted, I can't honestly say I'm finding it all that interesting. Not much wow factor. Given that Allagash 750s aren't cheap by any means, you do tend to expect some wow factor. That said, I'll gladly enjoy the rest of the bottle. A huge positive is its very reasonable 7.5% ABV as opposed to the typical 9-11% beast you get with this style."
"D - Very very drinkable for a heavy stout. Alcohol isn't present and mouthfeel is great."
"The best part about this beer is how consistent and smooth it is from front to back. There is a slight conflict between creamy and dry, as the beer possesses both characterisitics, though the finish remains primarily contingent on the sheer smoothness of structure of the roasted barley, light-bodied yeast, and sweet caramel. Very light, refreshing, and very smooth."
"D - One is enough at a time."
"D: Glad I had a chance to try this and its truly a unique and worthy interpretation of an English or American stout in a Belgian style."
"Drinkability: I would definitely have this again and if difinitely worth the try."
"Creamy clean feeling, not oily. Fairly lightly carbonated, pleasant."
"Overall, not a bad experience."
"Overall, the taste exhibits a complex range of flavors from sweet and malty up front to a bitter and drier aftertaste. The mouth feel is a bit heavy on the carbonation but still pleasant and full."
"Overall, a reasonably good brew, although slighty bland. Nice mouthfeel and highly drinkable."
"750 ml caged and corked bottle, Batch #4. Served in a chalice, the beer pours dark brown with about a half inch tan head. Head retention is good, not much lacing at all. The aroma is very nice, it smells like bittersweet chocolate, dark fruit (raisins, plums), coffee, and a bit of licorice. It tastes like roasted and burnt/smoked malt, coffee, plums and bittersweet chocolate, along with a bit of licorice and caramel. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's creamy and has medium/high, but soft carbonation. Drinkability is pretty good, it's very smooth and easy to drink. Overall I think this is a pretty good brew, it's tasty and very enjoyable. I'd definitely buy this again."
"This review was written based on my cask tasting, but since then I have had a regular tapping as well as many 750ml bottle pours. All were/are fantastic. One of my personal favorite beers, of which I have several now aging in my basement."
"Roasted barley and tinny bitterness up front. Peaty-smoked-charred roastedness surrounds dark fruits (figs, plums, raisins). Dark chocolate and roasted coffee mix with tobacco before a flash of sugary sweet molasses into the finish. Lingering roasted bitterness along with some leafy hops and some funky yeast. Delicious and complex, with a medium-full body, and creamy feel."
"Enjoyed on tap at Ashley's. Satisfying, its black yes with off-white head and its very lacey. A roasted stout aroma, medium mouthfeel. Coffee and roast, nutty, caramel, some candi. Aggressive carbonation. a good balance overall, and so good drinkability."
"I had this at an Allagash tasting on 7/23/2009. It was a rooftop bar - hard to get anything off the nose when the wind was whipping the aroma of the beer across the isle of manhattan!"
"Taste reflects the nose... Sweet malts amidst light coffee and chocolate. I really like the light body and high carbonation on this one, it really adds to the summertime drinkability."
"D: Aftertaste is big with this one. Not a bad beer, rich at times, but doesn't fill you up. A nice alternative to an American Stout."
"Drinkability- Its quite a confusing beer because it a unique interpretation of a style. However on a hot summer day it has all the characteristics of a satisfaction. Its lighter on flavor intensity and body, but not complexity."
"The 7.5%abv is very well hidden within this one. Throw in that the flavor is very good, well-balanced, and not overpowering, at all, and this is a tasty, drinkable, brew."
"D - A nice belgian stout, leaning more towards stout and less towards belgian, which is probably a good mix. The malt character is dark and complex while the yeast lends a mild fruity character that lifts the whole experience in a way that compliments the stout character without becoming cloying. One of those beers that is more than the sum of its parts."
"I liked this much more on tap than my previous bottle samplings."
"Don't be disappointed initially. Give it some time to warm up and you'll find yourself warming up in return."
"This beer really is one-of-a-kind, to my knowledge, and I really enjoyed its flavors. On-tap this beer just seemed confused, a misguided experiment in mashing two disparate styles, but I really enjoyed this in the bottle a lot more, so maybe age/secondary ferm. had something to do with it."
"Something different here, but nothing to seek out."
"D - Drinkability is good for the Black. The flavor works really well overall. Alcohol is hidden really well which makes this brew go down quicker than expected. The aroma could really use some work but everything else comes together to make a solid brew. Glad I got to try this one out. As it warms, the brew really smooths out in the flavor and drinkability categories."
"Drinkability: Extremely interesting, with characteristics from a number of styles; highly recommended and enjoyable"
"This might be one of my favorite beers. I love the complexity, and the variety of flavors that continue to evolve as the beer warms. I wish it came in a smaller bottle, a 750ml is definitely too much for one person to handle on their own. A 4-pack would be most welcome, but regardless of size, a fantastic brew that really warms you in the winter months."
"Drinkability: At 7.5% I have no intention of ever sharing this, other than to convert some anti-belgian stout/hopheads to the joy of more complex belgian flavors. This stuff is great. I'd love for some more breweries to try this idea-- make it 10%, thick, and syrupy."
"Body pours like a black ale and settles black in the glass. Doesn't have the huge thickness though. Head is a rocky biscuity light brown that initially stands at nearly three fingers and has nice retention. Nose is soft but has some nice yeasty chocolate esters to it. Enters the mouth creamy smooth and really reminds me of a well made milk stout. Chocolate pastry feel kind of like a doughnut makes up the charmingly sweet body of this brew. The Belgian styling really shines through in a positive way. Mouthfeel is a blanket of coco and Belgian yeast that mixes well together. Exceptional drinkability and just right amount of alcohol. Belgian stout it is."
"Pours dark brown. Thin creme head. Flavor is quite dough forward. Lots of it. Too much IMO. Minor spices in comparison, but still enough to make a prevalent stance. Minor funky tone. Feel has a pretty biting carbonation. Liquid is well bodied. Eh. For a Belgian style stout, this doesn't work for me. It's not that this beer is bad though. I've had this numerous times and have been equally impressed each time."
"Pours medium to dark brown, but more like a brown ale than a stout - not as thick or as dark as you would normally see. Sticky tan head, decent but not outstanding retention. Smell is superstrong yeast - like a burnt yeast, in keeping with the stout theme. Taste just like it smells - sweet like a milk stout, yeasty like a belgian, with a slight roasty overtone bringing the two together. It really is almost more like a belgian strong dark, but it lacks the complexity you like to see in the style. Slight roastiness lingers on the palate, but it's like drinking a Coffee Coolada compared to the real thing - kind of artificial sweet, meant to approximate the real thing, but not to be the real thing. Overall medium body, definitely on the lighter side for a stout. No real depth to the roastiness at all, like imitation instant coffee is to real coffee. Almost tastes watered down. Drinkability is OK, not really hampered by the alcohol content, but by the way the yeast and stouty bitterness merge - not offensive, but a bit disconcerting. I'm not a huge fan of this brew, and Allagash has done far greater things."
"Overall: The mouth feel is creamy and smooth. The body of the beer is thick, and finish is lasting and very good. I have recently became a fan of Allagash. Everything so far that I have tried has been wonderful. This is no exception. I love the balance and flavor throughout the beer."
"D - This was a very unique beer, not everything that I imagined in a Stout, but something new that was quite refreshing"
"On-tap at Pearly Baker's in Easton, PA. I've been making the rounds with Belgian stouts and this one stands out, for better or worse. It was not my favorite so far. It's not as drinkable as, say, the 9% De Dolle Extra Stout, but it's also more flavorful. There's a strong grape/plum fruit flavor that's too strong for my liking. Aside from that, there are pleasant roasted grains, dry cocoa, and a hint of espresso, maybe. Worth a try, but not my fav."
"Taste is more aggressive than I""d have though from the nose, fair amount of roasted malt, delicate chocolates, some hints of dark fruits, a light peatiness, pretty nice. Mouth is well carbonated, over medium body, and has a decent feel to it. In all, a pretty neat beer, nothing to get too excited about, but I enjoyed it all the same."
"D: Eh. Not really feeling it. I felt like this attempt at a Belgian-style stout ended up not really incorporating the best elements of each. It might be better out of the bottle, but I'm not looking to drop the $12 or so to find out."
"Aroma is cocoa powder and molasses with some bready yeast and brown sugar with hints of roasted grain to boot. First sip reveals a velvety smooth texture with soft mild spacious carbonation. Flavor is sweet and malty with no hops or hints of ABV. The beer finishes with a little roastiness and sweet brown sugar. Very easy drinking smooth brew. I recommend to all the ""maltys"" out there!"
"Popped the cork with little trouble. Poured with what has become and all too characteristic Belgian head. Thick, fluffy, and carbonated. Yet, it was cafe au lait. Most, strong dark ales have a slightly more scarlet color. Cool. The body was a dark woody black, with just a hint of brown hue shining through at the bottom of the glass. I was not terribly taken with the nose. Husky, corn-like, slighty witte-like nose belying the yeasty belgianness of the beer. It has almost the same exact nose as the Allagash Witte. Meh. The taste however, was infinitely more to my liking. Had the rich coffee flavors of a stout mixed with the cherry sweetness native to the dark Belgian ales. Very delicious. The mouthfeel was thick, but not chewy. Just enough of the bubbly, refreshing nature to keep it quenchable to my thirst at the end of the day. Despite the nose, I would definitely drink this again."
"750ml. Nice black pour with a creamish colored head. Roast aromas, mocha and some light fruits, red/banana? Tastes was a good mix of roast malt, cocoa, very light coffee. A little brown sugar, cinnamon roasted pecans. Really don't get the banana flavors I head about and lightly smelled in this. If the body was just a little heavier this could easily pass as a good stout. Finished dry and clean. Normally I don't care for Belgian style ale's of any sort, but this passed the grade with flying colors."
"D: To tell you the truth, I went into this not expecting much of anything. With that said, I have been pleasantly suprised. I really enjoyed this beer and it drinks pretty nicely for a stout. The flavors are well blended and crafted making this beer . . . harmonious. Very nice overall and I think my girlfriend would really enjoy this as well. Too bad she is asleep, gonna have to finish this 750 all by myself. I will just have to find a way to make it."
"Silkly smooth mouthfeel! Awesome."
"-Oelergud"
"Quite enjoyable! I found it almost relaxing as it was rich and supple, and I enjoyed it at a much slower rate than I would have most other beers. Very nicely done, and at a good price."
"Overall a very nice beer, extremely unique and tasty."
" No taste of alcohol, but not surprising as this one only checks in at 7.5% - also a tad expensive at $12 for the low alcohol brew."
"Very well balanced standout beer."
"Full and creamy body with a light level of carbonation. This is predominantly a mocha flavor brew. The swallow and aftertaste has a good dose of hop. Well balanced. Notable alcohol warmth."
"Drinkability is good for such a strong belgian dark ale. The balance of the two parts of the beer makes nothing overbearable in the drink. This is a nice representation of the style that is worth trying, but it will not blow your socks off."
"Drinkability: While this beer goes down easy, one bottle is good for the evening. I will definitely be looking for this one again though."
"Very dark brown with a fluffy tan head, lots of supporting carbonation rising to the surface. Lighter edges, chunky lacing. Aromas of dry yeast, bread crust, chocolate milk, malt, roast and dark fruits. Malt forward flavour, lots of chocolate notes (milk and semi-sweet), roast, dark fruits and a hint of sour cherry. Bitterness was average, making its presence known but not getting in the way of the malt. Not overly sweet though, with a bit of alcohol towards the end. Texture was decent, medium bodied with carbonation a little higher than average. Light warmth and a bit of dryness from the dark grains. Pretty good overall."
"Silky smooth, with full but fairly light body. Really fantastic beer when cask conditioned. I literally did not want to stop drinking it."
"D- Great flavor with moderate alcohol makes this bottle a pleasure to finish. I definitely wouldn't pop another, though."
"A nice spin on combining two somewhat contrasting styles. And certainly was worth trying."
"I bought this at Rick's Wine on Duke Street in Alexandria, VA. I enjoyed it with SurlySober and Flyer at a tasting at my house which also included RR Beatification and Westvleteren 12 (quite respectable, eh?)."
"Some unique flavors; however, the carbonation is extremely intense. An interesting idea from Allagash, but heavy on the spice and lacking in richness."
"Drinkability: Not my cup of tea, really. Hell Hath No Fury was better than this. This one's just a little too heavily roasted, a little too dry. It's worth at least one try, though I can't say I see myself going back to this one."
"Notes - Good drinkability, the ABV isn't evident in the lack of strong alcohol taste."
"Overall this isn't my favorite from Allagash, but it's still a solid offering. Worth a shot."
"Poured into a chalice a very nice black color, nice carbonation, nice little one-finger creamy tan head, which does leave some nice oil slicks and slight sticky lacing. The nose is malty, with some coffee/chocolate, some slight figs/prunes/raisins. The taste is malty, slightly bitter, nice notes of coffee/chocolate, also a hint of dark fruits. Medium body. Very drinkable, this is not a BSDA, but a Belgian Stout like the bottle sez, probably the first I've had, lol Recommended."
"Date consumed: 22 August 2008"
"Pours a slightly opaque dark reddish black, slightly cloudy, drops a pretty nice film of tan lacing on the glass, very thick layer and ring forms on the glass, very sticky lacing, looks nice. Smell is roasty, some chocolate, dark fruits, real toasty malts, some raisins, lots of Belgian fruity character, but some real nice stout character as well. Taste is nice, really raisiny some caramel malts, lots of fruity malt, some roasty middle, chocolate, very toasty, really nice and clean flavour, currants and raisins, spice in the finish but well balanced. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium carbonation, smooth, some warmth from alcohol but generally a well put together beer, real nice job. THanks Russ!"
"drinkability is good. nice balance. the stout and belgian allagash characters mesh well together. good stuff. i have another in the cellar and am interested to see how it changes with time."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, good kick, good representation of style, not usually the type of beer that I go for, but this is a good one to drink for a long time if you're in the mood for a very dark Belgian beer."
"This is good overall, though not my favorite from Allagash. Not the most complex stout or BSDA, this is still worth acquiring. A solid beer."
"D: Overall the drinkability of this brew is mediocre. I'm not a big fan of any brew with an identity crisis. Not my favorite as a stout and not my favorite as a strong dark ale. Not bad, but I doubt I'll buy it again."
"Pours with a three-finger light tan head that fades slowly leaving some lace. Totally black color. Light carbonation and heavy bodied. Roasted coffee nose. Flavor is roasted coffee with a slight sweet background, burnt coffee finish. Nice Belgian stout. Pricey at $13.00 for a 750ml bottle from a Tully's Beer & Wine Wells, ME."
"Eric"
"7/4/8/5/14 (3.8/5)"
"Overall, a good one-timer."
"ok, so it's roasty and spicy and belgiany and minimallyfruity and hoppy. tasty, but i feel it could be better"
"Back to the review. The beer is a very dark brown with little head. I prefer a somewhat lighter color for the style but again this beer does not seem to be trying to compete with classic Belgian Strong Darks and certainly looks nice in the glass. The smell is sweet but well-balanced. You can certainly smell the Belgian candy sugars. There are notes of vanilla, oak and earthy Belgian yeasts. It's a refined scent but not exactly my cup of tea at this point in my tasting life. I can imagine warming to this beer in time. The taste gives further signs of the care put into the beer. This beer certainly spent some time in fine casks. There are a lot of understated sweet notes and both rich chocolatey malt and perfectly balanced hops. However, it just doesn't quite add up for me. It's too sweet and too refined. It doesn't help that the feel is so light. I don't think anything about this beer is unintentional, so I'll just put it down to difference in taste. I'm sure that the most people will enjoy this beer and it would certainly make a good gift. It's a bit like a good dessert wine. I just don't happen to be a fan of that kind of thing. I aspire to like it even more, but this is my review for now."
"Pours dark brown, almost black. Foamy, cascading brown head. Pleasant aroma of vanilla, anise, chocolate malt, oak, and a kind of yeasty funkiness. Watery mouthfeel in terms of a stout. Some roasted malt and chocolate, but no coffee, bittersweet chocolate, or smokiness. Instead, there is the fruity-yeasty tastes one would expect from a dubbel. Anise, molasses, and some prune flavors come out when it warms. I hate saying this, but an overall disappointment."
"Drinkability is high, in that this is a fantastic beer. With exceptional depth, it's not one to drink with anything but a revered appreciation. Tempered by its limited availability and price, it's nevertheless absolutely worth seeking out. A benchmark for the style."
"D: I prefer this one from the bottle. It seems like the cask steals too much of the body on this one."
"Pours a dark black color with a foamy beige head. Aroma of roasted malt, chocolate, toast, coffee and toffee. Full bodied and smooth with loads of roasted malts, chocolate, coffee and sugar cane. Dry bitter finish."
"D - Although I thought this was good, I'm not sure I could drink more than one without thinking about switching to something else."
"D: I've been warming up to this (especially after the last flood of casks into Manhattan). I find it pretty drinkable. I could have more than one."
"Notes from 5/17/08"
"The aroma is almost salty with chocolate, coffee and toasted malt. The appearance is dark brown with a nice large head. The flavor is like the aroma and bitter. The palate is smooth. Overall interesting but not great considering the brewer. I would drink again but still not what I was expecting."
"750 ml bottle thanks to hopscotch. Pours a mostly black color with some red edges. A thick light brown head. The aroma is very nice; a sweet and rich fruity malt. Also some yeast, coffee and light milk chocolates. The flavor was excellent; toasted malts, rich chocolates, some sweet dark fruits, a bit of yeast, and a slight bitter coffee bean and hops. A excellent mouthfeel; rich and creamy. Just a great beer. I drank the 750 with ease, and wanted more."
"D: Not bad but it definitely pales in comparison to other great Belgian Strong Stouts like Black Albert and Bolshoi. 7.5% isn't extremely high, especially for the style but the alcohol is quite present and makes this drink like a much stronger beer."
"Drinkability - one of the more drinkable Belgians I've had, that it's fashioned into a stout-like style certainly helps. Thanks for the recommendation, Peanut, here's to your quickly restored good health my friend."
"Drinkability: A nice expensive chocolately unique Belgian Stout. I liked all the Belgian chocolates and roasted coffee beans in this beer, but I think the hefty price tag hurts the drinkability. Is it worth it? If you got the cash, then give it a try."
"This beer pours a dark brownish-black with a strong cocoa nib/ chocolate aroma. It has a tan head and a flavor of cocoa, earth, licorice, and some hop bitterness. Good Belgian-style stout with a nice lingering semi-hoppy, coffee bitterness in the finish."
"Comes out of the tap a deep opaque sable with a fairly thick tan head - very appetizing. Aroma is like well-roasted mocha and has just a hint of caramel. Flavor is rich and ""stouty"" - smoky with strong coffee and unsweetened chocolate components - and has just a touch of sweetness. Finish is smooth and very pleasing. A winner!"
"D: Very good. Nice flavors with a nice balance between roasted malt-type tastes and that dry finish."
"Pours a nice dark with a creamy look head. Medium malts and hops with a twinge of alcohol sweetness to it. This isn't really something I'd go out of my way to get ahold of, but if offered it I'd be a little happier."
"overall, an interesting if slightly underwhelming brew, nothing wrong with it at all but nothing worth seeking out again either."
"The drinkability is ok, A fine brew and good example of the style, but not quite what I look for. Prosit MK"
"D - Very drinkable for a stout. I could definitely down a few of these."
"Pours dark brown out of the bottle before settling in as a pitch black in the glass with a fluffy off-white head. Lacing was excellent. Roasted malts and hints of coffee in the nose. The taste is also dry and roasty with dark chocolate and a bit of roasted coffee in the taste. There is definitely a Belgian yeast presence in the background as well. The mouthfeel is medium bodied and highly carbonated with a very dry finish. This is a very nice and different stout from Allagash. Highly drinkable."
"This is a good brew not exceptional in my book especially for the price. Drinkability is good on this but the cask was better than the bottle"
"Relatively easy to drink, a definite sipper. A solid offering, but there is room for improvement. Definitely not a BSDA."
"D - Pretty good. A potent brew with a lot of flavor. Worth a try. I'll have again if found on tap. A nice stout. I wouldn't say it is a Belgian strong dark ale though."
"D - Overall this is an okay beer rolled out by Allagash. The flavors are good but nothing too complex. This is my first offering from them and it was above decent but nothing that blew me away. The MF was great but not enough to make me want to go out and find this beer."
"A really drinkable beer. Smooth and tasty."
"I got a growler of this beer @ Bellport Beer. This beer pours a very dark brown with a 1 fingered tan head with hardly any lacing. The smell is of roasted malts. The taste is nice, tbh if I was doing a blind taste test I would say this was Bluepoint Oatmeal stout (MUCH CHEAPER). There is a slight hops flavor and a wonderful toasted malt base. The mouthfeel is very pleasant and the carbonation is nice. A rather drinkable brew, but I think I would go with BPBC OS, its nearly the same beer @ 1/3 of the price."
"D- some complexing but nothing i find outstanding, an easy dark beer for people who are afraid of trying a stout. i do like this better than Ommegangs' because the alcohol is better hidden"
"Very frothy head that lasts and is very lacey in the glass. Not much of a bouquet even after sitting out and breathing for 15 minutes. Its light odor of sweet leather and a hint of smokeyness should have given away the drinkability but the color in a glass is very very dark. Pours very smooth. Drinks even smoother. No lingering alcohol after taste or bitterness on the back of your tongue. A hint of cofffee in the finish that is a pleasant surprise. The stout name belies the drinkable nature of this beer."
"Out of the bottle this brew is an opaque black with a thick foamy head of tan bubbles. Stubborn retention. Great nose of sweet malts, ripe fruits and rich soil. The taste is milk chocolate, roasted malt and some syrupy hints like fruit compote. Not as heavy as I was expecting, nor quite as deep. Still a great stout. 7 of 10 on the mouthfeel and 'weight' scale. Finishes a little sweet but not unpleasantly so. I like the White better personally, but this is still a fine beer."
"Definitely a sipper - maybe time will even this out. Good stuff - a little heavy with an independent alcohol burn though."
"The fine carbonation washes over the tongue and ends with a great clean finish. The beer really vanishes from the palate. Body is just about medium, just enough thickness to satisfy but not too heavy that it loses its delicateness."
"D- Goes down easier than most stouts."
"An interesting, enjoyable brew that combines a well-done roasty stout with a Belgian Dark (though a bit soft on the fruitiness). A well-balanced sipper."
"D: This is a drinkable beer. I'm not a huge fan of this style, but I'll admit it was well made."
"THE HAS EASILY MOVED INTO THE BEST 5 BEERS I HAVE EVER HADE! A MUST TO TRY!"
"This is an instant favorite. It does not sit heavy and could be enjoyed with a variety of foods. A slow drinker to imbibe in anytime."
"Overall, Allagash Black is another great beer from Allagash. It is definitely the best Belgian Style Stout that I have tried. Highly recommended."
"Pours a deep brown, borderline-black with dark ruby highlights, big foamy tan head hanging around for a loooong time, lots of lacing on the glass. Some dark fruit aroma, yeasty, some burnt coffee and smokiness. Lots of initial spice in the taste, mild coffee, some bittersweet chocolate. Medium-bodied, really creamy, light carbonation, some gentle lingering spice and bitterness. This is tasty, I'm sure it would pair well with lots of dishes, and I'd definitely seek this one out again."
"D- Easy to drink, would be a great breakfast Belgian."
"Soft and mellow. Plenty drinkable."
"A solid easy drinking stout, very smooth and balanced."
"Thanks to thirstybird for this one. 750 ml corked & caged bottle; batch #4 indicated on the label. Served in my Delirium Tremens tulip. Poured an opaque black with a one inch loose white head; tiny ringlets embedded in the cap. Head dissipated into a thin skim that coalesced around the perimeter of the glass; lacing was spotty and sparse. Nose presented with dark fruity esters and cocoa with a trace of alcohol. Taste consistent with nose; however, a light roasted coffee character is revealed in the mouth with a bit of char at the finish. Mouthfeel was light- to medium-bodied, but with a little too much carbonation, followed by a bit of alcohol astringency that lingers slightly between quaffs. Very enjoyable brew falling somewhere between a belgian strong dark and a foreign export stout. Nice blending of the styles."
"D: A pleasant surprise. Not too sure what I was really expecting, but this went beyond that. I look forward to another date with this one. A good choice."
"Rich. Bold. Chewy. Refined. This is a great brew and I very much enjoyed it. Highly recommended."
"I've been looking forward to this one. Allagash produces some of the bast belgian-syle beer in the US. The beer poured a dark black. Holding my glass up to the light you can see some reddish-brown peaking through. Head is a nice mocha color with good retention and nice lacing. Note I've poured this into a glass with a nucleation point at the bottom. Flavor is complex with deep roasted malts, coffee and faint hints of chocolate. Finish is wonderful and is really the only chance to notice the alcohol. A beautiful stout."
"Had on tap Friday at night at Tyler's Taproom in Carrboro.Poured into a small goblet a deep but not entirely opaque black, a bit of ruby did show thru with a thinner light mocha colored head.Aromas were not as bold as expected,I picked up some roasted malt and brown sugar,the chocolate was very faint.Flavors were great with some good complexity,starting out with some brown sugar and bitter chocolate melding into a roasted and smoky finish,I really liked the smoke element it went well with the light sweetness of the beer.To me very stout-like on the palate,a very nice brew."
"Very tasty and high drinkability. Would recommend drinking at cellar temperature. Some of the flavors are subtle and open up as the beer warms."
" We have a winner! unique with a perfect balance, complexity is off the charts...I just don't want to see it end!!"
"Dark brown/black color with a fully foaming and long lasting head of foam. Intricate nose showcases notes of cocoa and roast, as well as dark fruit notes of syrah grapes and blackberries. Flavor has nice balance, but is perhaps a bit sweet. Similar notes as in the aroma, lots of sweet dark red fruit notes. Could have more dark malt notes to improve it. Overall, it's a well made ale."
"Pours like a stout but a bit thinner a livelier. Dark, black and opaque. Smells a bit mild. Coffee and chocolate. Didn't smell like belgian yeast/malt as much as I'd hoped but the belgian attributes were almost there. It definitely had the irish stout/belgian quadruppel hybrid-type aroma and taste. It was just a bit too mild for me. Still a good beer. Very drinkable."
"Bottle: Poured a clear black color ale with a large off-white foamy head with great retention and good lacing. Aroma of light roasted malt with some medium sweet malt notes. Taste is also dominated by some light chocolate roasted malt notes with a nice Belgian-style malt backbone. Average body with good carbonation and no apparent alcohol. Not bad but I was expecting more complexity and maybe more chocolate, vanilla or maybe some ester. A bit like the Troubadour Obscura but with a heftier price tag."
"It's more drinkable than it deserves to be, I feel. Maybe it's the bottle, maybe it's the relative simplicity of it all... but I want more, even as I wasn't blown away by any particular aspect."
"Another brew by Allagash that I was fairly impressed with. Nothing too crazy but was still very good over all."
"Beer poured black almost opaque but not cloudy at all with a tan head. The aroma was a beautiful roasty and chocolate with slight hints of coffee. The flavor has the same roast as in the flavor with out a lot of complexity. It was chocolaty but the mouthfeel was a little thin and spritzy. Maybe a little more oats in the malt bill would have improved the beers creaminess and helped to round out the flavor profile. Overall very drinkable, but the top Belgian stout that I have ever had."
"The beer pours a black color with a thick frothy tan head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a dry, earthy, black, chocolate, and roasted malt scent along with a light Belgian yeast fruitiness. The taste is great! I'm not sure I'm a huge fan of this concept, but this seems to be the benchmark for Belgian stouts; dry, earthy, thinner mouthfeel, fruity yeast esters. This is a damn good stout. The mouthfeel is fine. It's full bodied with adequate carbonation, but it's thinner than a regular imperial stout. This beer drinks well. It's complex and flavorful, but it doesn't sell out the stout style."
"A very nice stout. Disregard the ""Belgian Strong Dark Ale"" label on BA, the bottle itself brands it as a ""Belgian style stout," which seems more accurate. I think it's a bit pricey (maybe $10) but it is very good, I'm definitely going to buy another bottle."
"D: For a stout, it is relatively drinkable. However, since its not as creamy as some I cant give it the highest of marks."
"The taste starts fruity, chocolate, malty, syrupy fruit, slightly boozey, nice alcohol presence. There is a nice hop profile for balance. Apple, plum, fruit, a small alcohol presence finishes sweet with enough balance to make this phenomenal very different, I will be going back to this beer and have."
"D : Real good drinkability. Defintely different than the typical American stout."
"When I first opened the bottle I could immediately smell coffee and cocoa. Not being a huge fan of coffee I was a little hesitant. Once I tried it I was hit with much more chocolate and toffee flavors. This was a nice surprise since I wasn't looking foward too much to the coffee. It felt creamy on the tongue with a bit of that stouty bitterness. The coffee came up strong on the finish, but wasn't overpowering. All in all I was pretty impressed with Allagash Black and would drink it again for sure."
"Drinkability: I'm not sure how this lines up with my expectations, because I'm not sure what my expectations were. This is probably a bit much for a session beer, given the ABV, but I'd love to try the classic pairing (at least for my classification) with several dozen oysters."
"D: Very good drinkability, which just may be an understatement."
"Pours a clear dark brown color that's almost opaque. Yields a large foamy tan head, of tiny bubbles, that fades fairly quickly leaving spotty patterns of lacing. The smell is an ever-so-slightly roasted malt chocolate, NECCO wafer aroma. Adequately carbonated, a small tingle of hops and alcohol, the mouth feel is light-medium bodied. The flavor and the nose are quite similar. There is a subtle tangy character of the mouth that's keeping things interesting. I guess i shouldn't be as shocked as i am about the enormity of acceptable interpretations of the ""Belgian Strong Dark Ale"". I've come to expect an earthy yeast component and a dark fruit character, neither of which was predominant in this sample. Goes to show...keep your expectations in check. The marketing department tells us that anything in a corked and caged 750 from Allagash must be 'special'. Stow it."
" Edit: well you knew i was new at this, because i said that this was a ""growler"". It actually was a 750 ml bottle. Der der der der der."
"Has a dark black color with a one finger tan creamy head with great retention leaving significant lacing. Roasted malts, chocolate, and alcohol are the main aromas. The up front taste is light smoke, dark chocolate and alcohol which leads to a bitter hop finish and a chocolate aftertaste. Full bodied, light carbonation, starts with a creamy mouthfeel and ends with a chalky one. Not as complex as a Belgian Strong Dark Ale should be, but good drinkability anyway."
"A pretty darn good stout. Not sure what makes it Belgian style, other than the fact that Allagash seems to insist on all of their beers being identified as Belgian."
"M/D: The beer was thick, smooth and very drinkable, but perhaps not by itself. Maybe with a good steak, but one that I will buy again."
"Not a beer I particularly liked, though it was interesting and well-made."
"D- This is very nice, especially with the low ABV. Lots of flavor and lots of dollars to procure. The hefty price tag is off-setting."
"D: Very drinkable. Drinks almost like a Guinness but with more flavor."
"Pours a jet black color with an incredibly thick, fluffy, tan head (a very light tan color). Immediately, brown sugar and sweet fruity syrup scents appear. Alcohol and roasted malt shortly follows. The smell reminds me very much of Avery's The Beast or DFH's 120 Minute; extremely sweet with a nice roasted hint. The flavor turns your attention to more roasted characteristics; chocolate, coffee, and malt. There is also banana, cherry, oak, grain, spices, and sugar that are present in the taste. Very awesome beer. Extremely unique...a definite must for everyone to try."
"D - Missing all qualities of a belgian and did not live up to its description. It was decent, but replaceable with most other stouts."
" Poured into a goblet. Looks like black cola with a small tan head and brown edges. Nose is malts, slightly metallic, some Euro hops in there too. Mild. taste is gently toasted malts, some farmy/barny flavors, and oil. Mouthfeel is tangy and full. Somewhat drinkable, but better for sharing."
"D- Think this is an excellent Belgian Stout. I couldn't imagine a better depiction of this style."
"Taste is of roasted, almost burnt malt, with a coffee like characteristic. Chocolate is in there, as well as a touch of licorice and spice, and a bit of fruity yeast in the background. Mouthfeel is medium and smooth. I would like a little more body but its not bad. Alcohol is completely hidden here. I enjoy this beer."
"Allagash isn't as consistently excellent as they need to be for inclusion in the firmament of great American craft breweries. They're capable of brewing some of the best Belgian style ales in America. And they're also capable of brewing beer that is merely good. It's hard to complain too loudly about Black, but Russian River and The Lost Abbey are beginning to leave these guys in their dust. That said, I'm still a huge fan."
"D: A big Belgian ale that weighs in at under 8%? I am in heaven. I like this beer, especially as it warms on the tongue."
"This beer had all the makings of an Imperial Stout with just a subtle hint of Belgian spices. Big smoky, chocolate flavor up front, with roasted nuts and spices following. Very minimal hop presence, but it didn't detract from the experience. SLight dark fruit flavor as well. Mouthfeel was a touch on the thin side. Overall I really enjoyed this one. Not quite Belgian, not quite RIS, but very enjoyable."
"Overall a decent offering. I drank this one at room temperature, but there was something off in the conflicting flavors. Perhaps too much of an herbal character."
"Good try with undoubtedly good intentions, but off the mark IMHO."
"Very good."
"This is an interesting hybrid between stout and BSDA. It is unlike anything I've previously tried, but very nicely done. My taste buds just wish the dark fruit presence was a little stronger."
"M/D: Full bodied, a bit thin, light carbonation, good mouthfeel and good drinkability. A pretty decent brew. I wouldn't really call it a stout or strong dark ale, more like souped up brown ale (that isn't a stout or a porter). Pretty good beer."
"I've had a couple of these ""Belgian-style stouts"" lately and so far I'm a fan."
"Drinkability - I enjoyed Allagash's effort at the style. It reminded me so much of their Dubbel Reserve which lacked in complexity as well but more than made up for it with the wonderful chocolate notes and first class carbonation. This one focused a bit less on the chocolate and more on the coffee but delivered the same one-two punch. Nicely done, Allagash."
"Gotta be my least favorite from the Allagash brand, though I'm glad I tried it."
"Drinkability- I enjoyed this brew, but not as the bargain price of $12.99 I paid. Put the price down about $4 and I'll buy this regularly."
"Had on cask at Moan and Dove. The appearance was great: it had a dark black look with immediate lacing. Very strong alcohol aromas were detected with other flavors such as mocha sensed in the back burner. It did have a pretty malty flavor but its alcohol aftertaste was wicked. I felt the mouthfeel was the weakest aspect of the drink: very low body feel. It was not watery or anything, but the drink lacked any spirit or soul to it. It was just plain flat I felt. Overall, this drink has some wonderful dimensions here and there, but perhaps I should try it beyond its cask."
"Another very good entry from a brewer that's rapidly climbing my list. Pours a dense purplish black with a dense, surging head. Lots of roast on the nose. The initial flavor notes are actually kind of sweet (candi sugar?) but that gives way to a really nice mix of roastiness, Belgian floral, unsweetened chocolate, and some woodiness. Moutheel is amazingly smooth and lush. Aftertaste is pleasantly sharp, mild roasty bitterness layered over some sweetness and floral. Definitely recommended."
"Definitely drinkable, but the mouthfeel isn't what I'd prefer."
"Cheers"
"Very enjoyable to drink, but a bit pricey."
"A very nice experience."
"This Belgian-style stout poured opaque, pitch black with tan head. It had that typical Belgian wild yeast smell mixed with burnt dark chocolate. It tasted like dark chocolate and creamy coffee hops, along with wild yeast. As the beer warmed, the yeast flavor faded, and the coffee flavor really came out. It was watery with slight carbonation and a mildly bitter chocolate aftertaste. Overall this is probably my favorite Belgian style, great to drink by fireside, but this particular beer missed some of it potential. It was quite tasty, but lacked the refinement that could have made me more passionate about it."
"An interesting beer, the dark malt at times can overwhelm the softer yeast character, but I have a feeling that it contributes more than one might expect (probably adds to the smokiness of this brew). On the other hand I was feeling like a roasty stout this evening, and this most definitely fits the bill (with a little added complexity & lighter body than one would typically find in one). As the beer warmed it becomes more complex, which definitely helps my enjoyment."
"The beer poured with a small tan head on dark brown body. The head was a little small, but it lasted for the entire glass. Very interesting smell, spicy clove notes over a chocolate espresso roasted malt background. This is very effervescent and it brings the cloves out right away, then giving away to the chocolate/coffee smoothness. There is a bitterness component here too but the dry finish gets rid of that quickly. A very unique beer, not a stout, not a belgian strong dark ale, I would call it a dark triple. Very interesting and tasty."
"Surprised to see this, so I grabbed it even though it had a high price tag, never though Allagash would make a dark beer but what do I know, would drink again only if I did not have to pay for it, recommended to try once though"
"Overall, I like this one- an easy taster, nicely drinkable, interesting, pleasant, but too expensive!"
"Taste reminded me of a smoked porter with a slight twinge of Belgian yesty flavor. Roasty with some dried fruit flavor. Tannic finish."
"Note: this is really far from a Belgian strong dark ale, in my opinion. More like a Schwarzbier crossed with a heavy stout. Nonetheless, an enjoyable beer!"
"OK beer that looks great and tastes OK. Maybe a little age will help this with a more complex smell and more varied flavors."
"D: nice beer. quite drinkable. wasn't quite sure what i was getting with a belgian style stout but it works."
"Drinkability: A decent Belgian-minded stout from the folks at Allagash, though I didn't care for that herbal, mentholyptus-esque taste and aroma I kept running into even if it cured me off my nagging cough."
"Pours a rich brown translucent on the edges with a tan head that lasts with solid lacing. Smells a phenolic peculiar yeast offering without much malt aroma coming through. Taste is quite malty, slightly biter, dark black patent malts a hint of dark caramel malts. Well balanced slightly bitter very well done stout with just enough hops to kill the chance of the beer being cloying. Well done and a nice twist to the typical stout with a flair of Belgian (or allagashian) yeast peculiarity."
"D: A pretty drinkable beer from Allagash, interesting mix of styles, definitely worth a shot for the Allagash fan, though I though it was just OK."
"D - Love it! Could go on drinking this for hours if only I had a few more to share. It has comfort beer flavor w/ sweet dark malt, spice and a hint of warming alcohol that makes it an all around nice quaff. It reminds me of Hell hath no fury slightly and my own Zwartbier which is based on 1554 Belgian black ale. I recommend this if you like dark belgians or just want to try something new."
"Belgian bomber, caged and corked, no freshness/bottling date info. Allowed to warm to near room temp. Pours pretty much black, quickly departing 1 inch head, that leaves a thin tiny bubble film and then moderate lacing. Mocha, and subtle cafe au lait infused nose. Interesting yet slightly underwhelming brew. Notes of roasty grains, more light coffee, chocolate mouse and powdered sugars. Drying late with some fruity and yeasty notes. I get a certain tartness and some prickle on the tongue. The finish is strangely flavorless. Not a user friendly brew. Glad I let this one warm up quite a bit. Something about it did not work for me."
"d: I love it when a beer refuses to be pigeon-holed. Thanks to Allagash for trying something new, and thanks to barleywinebrewer for the chance to try it."
"I am not sure where the 7.5% is, i cant taste it or smell it. I think it will find me at the bottom of the 750 since i will have no problems finishing this by myself. This is one i could session easily, and really enjoy doing it, if i was not driving. I dont know what the hype factor was, but this is A+ for me. I wish i had a case of this."
"Bottom line: There are plenty of good stouts and good Belgians (some by Allagash), this one just isn't worth the cost and definitely does not meet up to the hype."
"I had high expectations this beer and I was a little disappointed. The beer is considered to be a Belgian ale. But, frankly, the beer lacks character. The effervescence is apparent, like most Belgian ales. That's where the similarities end. Nothing jumps out at me when I taste it. There are no defining characteristics in the taste. Overall, this beer isn't bad, but I've definitely had better."
"Poured into a Rapscallion glass, formed a 1"" tan head over the almost opaque dark brown brew. Frothy head lasts well, with ample amounts of delicate lacing. Aroma is delicate dark grains, with a touch of fruitiness. Taste is lightly of dark malt, roasty and sweet, goes a bit spicy in the middle, and then closes so smoothly you wonder where it went. Mouthfeel is amazing, and drinkability is superb. This makes me wonder if this is what a bier de garde made in the stout vein would end up like. Don't know where the alcohol is, but I'm sure it'll find me later. Great stuff."
"Smelled malts, chocolate, and also a little fruity. Tastes of coffee and chocolates with a hint of alcohol in it. Great carbonation in this beer and the flavors stay with you long after you take a sip. I think Allagash makes a great beer that i will absolutely have again."
"As I said, it's certifiably Allagash, but the overall presentation isn't as smooth and seamless as I expect from them. It's a Belgian style stout, but it lacks a real Belgian style presence despite the esters. The ABV is solid, but it's worked in nicely, and as a result it drinks suitably well. No major issues here, but Allagash has set the bar pretty high for me, so I believe there are other offerings I'll turn to before this one."
"One tires of all these insane 12% abv American Stouts and Barleywines after a while, and Allagash has decided to take an alternate tack and brew something drinkable and mild. Black is quite drinkable and one of the better beers I've had from the brewery, which is saying a lot. Rob Tod and Company absolutely know what they're doing."
"D- Outrageously drinkable. The balance between the sweet, Belgian notes and the coffeeish, roasty notes is excellent."
"Poured into a snifter, the Black pours, um black. It pours an opaque rich black, that foams up like most Allagashes when you pour them, that leaves a nice rich head that is slightly off-white. Not a very rich aroma, slight hints of sweet malts and yeast are the lead. Wonderful flavors of dark chocolate, like that 85% caocao kind, along with roasted malts. Mouthfeel is great, smooth and a mild yet bubbly carbonation. Its a little pricey but I also got it at cost, so I bought two cases, some for trade and some for cellaring. Very drinkable."
"Now the final criterion--was it worth $12 something for 750ml? Hmmm... good question."
"I've always wished the 'gash would release a stout, and the black was all that I could dream for and more. The taste is rich in roasted barley and dark chocolate. And the belgian yeast strain gives a nice fruity twist at the end. The mouthfeel is phenomenally silky and smooth - which makes the drinkability amazing. I could drink these all night long - and WILL."
"750 ML bottle copped from Wine and Beverage Depot in Totowa for $13.99... heard a lot of good things about this brew, and as a fan of Allagash, definitely wanted to try their ""Belgian Style Stout""... Very impressive appearance - jet black, deep, dark, ebony hue with an immense tan and frothy head that lingered for a bit before receding... Smell was replete with cocoa, espresso, and dark lattee nuances... Very good, rich taste... not overbearing or cloying, but right on the money with a smooth, crisp, chocolate flavor loaded with roasted malts and espresso flavors - the nice thing about this beer is that the aftertaste has a very strong chocolate presence that is certainly noticeable and undeniable... Great roasted malt flavor... good, solid brew from Allagash, but certainly not worth nearly the fourteen bucks I dished out for this one... good mouthfeel, full of dark brown sugars and cocoa malts, with a relatively easy drinkability for a 7.5% ABV... not Allagash's best brew, but certainly worth a try if you're willing to open your wallet... good stuff... Recommended..."
"Different, but it doesn't break into the rotation."
"D - quite lovely! The roasted malt and chocolate present here make this one really enjoyable to drink, especially in the winter time (despite it being shockingly warm this week). I had a bit of this on tap a few weeks ago when my gf ordered one at the pub and definitely enjoyed it then. Would certainly order again."
"Pours a great black, deep, muddy brown. Can only see the tiny bubbles at the very top of the brew. You can see tiny bubbles actually breaking through in small concentrated areas. Very little head orlacing. But with each swirl I take, there is a small swell of bubbles around the edges of the black brew. The aroma is a mineraly chocolate and coffee rosted malt. The taste follows well with the deep roasted coffee and dark chocolate. The candi sugar blends well with the bitter chocolate coffee. The palate is smooth ik silk. A little warmth, and a slightly dry finish that lingers. Great beer."
"Pours black with a decent initial head and some lacing. Quite spritzy. The aromas are quite roasty, abit more than some other Belgian stouts. Some yeasty pear esters are also there, but no banana or clove. The taste is similar but surprisingly chocolatey at the end. Other than that, fairly light and easy to drink with more typical Belgian yeast notes thoughout. Mouthfeel is quite carbonated, a little light, and somewhat ethereal- its got that stout roastiness but light Belgian feeling at the same time. Like many of the other Belgian style stouts I've had, this sldes right down. This style is known for roastiness meets slightly sour and light bodied drinkability, and this beer is no exception, but maybe a little roastier than many of the others of the style. Very nice."
"Although arguments can be made for all of these varying flavors having too much contrast and confilict. The texture is lighter on the toung that expected, because of high carbonation levels and high attenuation rates. The beer finishes ashy, smoky and astringent and with a roasted grain bitterness that thankfully closes the beer with little after taste or texture."
"Drinkability: Medium-high. Certainly a lot more drinkable than some heavy stouts."
"Mouthfeel is smooth and lighter with good bubbly carbonation. Goes down easy as it is not too heavy. This 750 is a treat and another good brew from Allagash. Check this one out while you can as it is a tasty example of a Belgian style stout."
"D- Give me another bartender! I really like this beer. Great flavor w/o being overwhelming. This beer does hide it's alcohol well also."
"It's a nice drinking beer, that seems much bigger then it tastes."
"D: Somewhat drinkable - I could have gone for another but I'd probably have stopped with the second if I did."
"D- I do enjoy a good Belgian influenced stout and this is a great example of this style. The flavors are dark but very smooth and well blended to create a mysterious quality. The funk hints really to compliment the black roasted malt and creamy flavors."
"Verdict: Even though this is classified as a Belgian Strong Dark Ale, I think it's not too far off the mark from being a stout. My issue with it is that it's just not restrained enough. A good brew overall."
"I was very excited to find this beer, but was a little let down. I would recommend a try, however, if you can get your hands on it. But, I would prefer a De Dolle for my belgian stout. Cheers!"
"750ml bottle from Lou's in Augusta. Pours a virtually opaque black body with a half inch of tan head. Smoked malts dominate the aroma with slight citrus notes. Roasted malts come on strong initially, with bitter coffee/dark chocolate bordering on ashey and a slight smokey notes in the background. Not quite astringent with moderate carbonation and a full body. Fairly smokey toward the finish. Not bad. Not quite what I was expecting, but interesting and unlike anything I've had in many ways. Alcohol is well-hidden and that with the mouthfeel make this an easier drinker than some beers half as strong. Pretty good."
"A 750ml bottle purchased for $11.99 at Carl's Meat Market in Kittery. Enjoyed it quite a lot, and was happy to hear it will be a year-round beer. Poured into a goblet, it was a very dark brown, almost black, with a medium-sized mocha head. It had a sweet, chocolate aroma, with a little bit of fruitiness. Great taste, milk chocolate, coffee, yeasty. At the end there was a hint of licorice. Not a heavy beer, very drinkable."
"Out of a 750ml corked and caged bottle. Pours an almost near black color with an average tan head that dissipated quickly into a ring around the glass. The smell is of Beligan candi sugar, light fruit, light roasted malt and mocha. The taste starts off with a nice Beligan dark fruit esters and candi sugar. The dark fruit esters are not as pronounced as a normal BSDA because they are quickly matched with a roasted malt/coffee balance. If find the taste to be quite unique and enjoyable. The feel is moderate but lighter than expected. The carbonation is a bit more fizzy than I expected as well. The brew finishes well and has nice balance. I didn't know what to expect with this one. I does seem to fit the Beligan stout label. A must try."
"This is a great blend of an American/English style with a Belgian brewing technique. It doesn't taste forced at all. It's like this has been the main tradition for centuries. It's a Belgian Strong Dark Ale by name only, it's more of a Belgian Strong Stout. I think this is one of the better ultra-dark Belgian ales. Recommended."
"M&D - smooth and fill bodied at first, then followed up by that aforementioned alcohol burn, this is pretty good, at least off tap, i would like to try a bottle of this"
"This is definitely a good beer, although not one of the best I've had. It's a unique combination of flavors for sure, but nothing really stands out, and there's not really anything new here. Regardless, it's still very good and I recommend it."
"This is another interesting variety from Allagash coming in their 750ML bottles. This beer pours a very blackish color with a nice tan head that certainly retains. The beer doesn't lace particularly well. The appearance is quite good, but the smell diminishes the experience to a degree. You will definitely encounter earthy tones, coffee aromas, burnt or roasted grains, perhaps a bit of chocolate, and then something else not so pleasant. At first I thought it was like a stale soy sauce smell, but other reviewers call it a lactic aroma. I'll go along with that. It's not pleasant. The one characteristic of this beer is its incredible silky smoothness on the tongue. This is like drinking milk chocolate in terms of mouthfeel. The taste is quite tart and sharp in the finish. The mouthfeel is delightful and the mid sections give you that roasted maltiness that is pleasing, but then you come up against too strong an astringency that is off putting. The alcohol is warming and about right, but this beer just comes off as too sharp for the style. The beer is moderately carbonated, medium bodied, and just wonderful on the tongue. It's too bad that the flavor and aroma could not follow suit with the creamy consistency."
"Overall, a damn fine beer from a fantastic brewery. If I were tasting it blind, I wouldn't have thought Belgian stout, I'd have thought coffee stout for sure. Well worth trying."
"D - the lactic aroma/flavor fades as it warms but this one just doesn't blend together the best."
"definitely not a brew that bashes you upside the head and says this is the dominate note. this is a brew that confidently and quitely says there's a flavor to contemplate and savor in here!"
"D - This beer really didn't work for me. Body was too weak, flavors were jumbled and didn't seem to compliment each other. Might need another taste, but seemed bad to me today."
"On tap at Deep Ellum in Allston, MA. Showed up an opaque black with a soft light-brown head that reduces reasonably quickly. A lot of creamy milk chocolate on the palate -- very rich and smooth. The mouthfeel was satiny smooth but without a lot of heft in its presence. Pretty drinkable -- like a serving of mocha iced coffee. Really didn't strike me as a Belgian-style ale -- I'm not totally sure how I'd categorize it. It was a strange one, but a highly enjoyable one nonetheless."
"The taste is of roasted malt and a lingering coffee aftertaste. The carbonation dances around the mouth with a crisp feel, not quite like a typical stout and I agree it's more of a dark Belgian ale, but it could certainly be a class of it's own."
"It's black with a thin and rapidly dissipating chocolate milk colored head. - you can find a variety of lighter hues depending upon how you struggle to hold it up to various lights at various angles in various glasses. Pardon me for being cynical on that score. There is an aroma of roasted malts - some cocoa and black coffee with hints of phenols appropriate to Belgian ale yeasts interacting with ""a large addition of Belgian dark candi."" The flavor is roasty, acidic and bitter - the qualities that cause most people to insist on cream and sugar with their coffee. The mouth feel is thin with prickly carbonation that lifts the acidic coffee flavor to the roof of the mouth and up the nose through the back door in your throat. This may very well benefit from some aging, though not for too long. Maybe up to a year? As it warms up, the aroma becomes more stout-like, and the flavor more Belgian. Objectively speaking, this is an interesting study for my palette. Subjectively speaking, I'm not very fond of it, but don't worry, timtim is on his way here within 48 hours with a disorienting rave review."
"good drinkability not a booze bomb, as this type of beer could be, and all the flavors remain in check. a complex in interesting beer."
"I poured this big beer into my tumbler at 50 degrees. The beeer was certainly black with a big tan head that was impressive at first thenn fell away. Lacing was really nice also. The smell was thick of coffee. The taste was a little fruitty and had a roasted coffee taste that was good. I would buy this beer again."
"There are times where I wish certain breweries would brew a particular style of beer. This is one of those cases....never expected that Allagash would brew a stout. Poured in to my new Allagash goblet a chestnut brown, with a large tannish white head that has good retention. Many earthy aromas are in the smell, along with a faint milk chocolate. Taste continues on the milk chocolate note, with some buttery caramel, and a somewhat spicy bitter finish. Mouthfeel is somewhere between medium and large. Certainly an easy drinking beer here. Goes down silky smooth, and the alcohol is not in your face. Quite an interesting brew we have here. Has stout characteristics, yet falls outside the realm of anything the English or other American breweries have done with the style. Without a doubt this should be a style unto its own. Another great job from Allagash."
"The mouth feel is light and this is very drinkable. I could easily see myself polishing off two or three of these 750s, except that they aren't cheap ($13.50 for the bottle). Absolutely recommended if you can find it."
"Pours black in color, with a soft, nutty, off-white head that fades, after a while, to a collar. The nose is that of a lactose-sweetened English stout, softened by Belgian yeast esters and phenols. Some chocolate or carafa malt also makes its way into the aroma, along with a nutty creaminess. On the palate, malt bitterness crops up first, then some fruity sweetness and cream stout kind of flavors at the mid-palate. The finish is full of yeasty flavors. Mouthfeel is what you'd expect from a Belgian/stout hybrid -- very smooth and slick on the palate, with alcohol that is just about imperceptible. Overall, this is a wonderful beer, and exactly the kind of genre-expanding efforts you'd want from the special line of Allagash beers. Well done."
"Drinkability: This beer really is what it claims  a Belgian style stout. As such, I am at a loss to classify it given the BA categories. It has the sweetness and smoothness of a milk stout, but the sweetness comes largely from the Belgian yeast. So, since there is no Belgian stout style, for now I guess I will reluctantly place it under the Belgian strong dark ale category. Whatever you call it, this is one of the most drinkable stouts I have run across. I would down quite a few of these, without realizing it has a 7.5% APV, making it delicious and dangerous stuff. Congrats to the crew at Allagash for another wonderful creation."
