4.26,1.7,4.25,4.5,4.25,3.75,4.25,"Pours a healthy two finger head, dark tan in hue, the large percentage of bigger bubbles creates a mottled surface, thick globs of lacing left behind. Deep brown colored liquid, cleaner than expected but too dark for transparency, basically wall-to-wall active bubbles too thick to form single beads. The nose definitely betrays a sour, grapey side, clears a path for the thicker, sweeter milk chocolate, scone, molasses and plum, cherry to raisin, prune fruit scents, there is a palpable “sour bois” funk to it, bark, leaves and black tea leaves as well as a modicum of grapefruit pith, truly needs to get close to room temperature to really open up and shine. Full-bodied, needs all that carbonation to prevent it from congealing although, truthfully, it is more pinpoint prickles than foaminess. Minerals, damp earth and sour grapefruit have the speed to get in there before the chocolate, sweet baking spices, yeast and baking dough, root beer and cola bean notes. As a result, the moments of sweetness are deep but not long lived. Same blend of cherry, raisin, date fruit, more concentrated than sweet. Finishes on a metallic note. Sometimes it is annoying when a beer zigs and zags on you, here it just makes you like it more.","farrago","Jan 11, 2015"

4.48,6.9,4.25,4.25,4.5,4.5,4.75,"somewhere between a belgian dubbel and belgian strong dark, this is incredible beer, one of the more dynamic and well built examples of the style and even the country i have seen. on tap at bull and bush for a quite reasonable $8.50 per ten ounce. dark copper to magenta in color, weirdly tinted, but bright and clear with a tall and cool whip thick bone white head. the nose is stunning, malty and big, familiar in that regard, refined yet unique in yeast character, more spice than fruit, maybe dried fruit, and layered with complexities. the flavor is equally jarring, truly different this one. layers of mature and fresh grain alternate on waves of pillowy textured effervescence and just lasts for ever on the palate. golden raison to caramelized sugars to allspice, this is really flavorful, but very hard to describe because its spectrum is so foreign to me. there is some residual sugar in this, but i suspect the yeast has pretty close to finished up and 9% abv (thats what the menu listed anyway). de dolle beers have been hard to find for me, but i feel luck to have tried this one, i even bought a second one. my girlfriend was also extremely into this one, and her palate tired of beer some time ago. really different, huge body but so gentle in feel. this is some of the best belgian beer i have ever had.","StonedTrippin","Aug 06, 2014"

The aroma is complex suggesting dried fruits such as figs and raisins along with a very tawny character remiscent of port wine. There's even a hint of smoke. This smooth malt and sugar bomb has a tawny port character that carries through the taste of this beer along with some marzipan sweetness and a boozy finish.

Pours very hazy deep ruby red color with a fairly dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty foamy lacing clings on the glass, with a large amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of pear, apple, raisin, plum, fig, white grape, caramel, candi sugar, bread, clove, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good complexity of fruity/earthy yeast ester and balanced dark/candi sugar malt sweetness; with good strength. Taste of big raisin, plum, fig, pear, apple, white grape, caramel, bread, candi sugar, clove, herbal, light pepper, and yeast earthiness. Lingering notes of raisin, plum, pear, apple, fig, white grape, caramel, bread, candi sugar, clove, herbal, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice complexity of fruity/earthy yeast with a good amount of dark/bready malt sweetness; with a great malt/yeast balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a very smooth, crisp, and moderately slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent Belgian strong dark ale. All around great complexity and balance of fruity/spicy yeast and dark/bready malt sweetness; and very smooth to sip on for the ABV. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Mar 30, 2014"

Aroma of plums and figs, cherries, pears, some hops, and lots of yeasty dryness. Flavor has a nice up front bitter that fades into prunes and yeast flavor. A bit of tart yeast lingers. Bubbly and prickly carbonation makes this lighter than I expected. Solid brew, though I like my Belgians a little sweeter than this. Nice balance overall.","BMMillsy","Aug 24, 2013"

Next time I do, I'll pick it up and crack it open. I fear that age has just dried it out until it's nothing but yeast bi-products and the malt is having a difficult time shining through.

4.23,1,4.5,4,4,5,4.5,"O - I've had the Reserva before having the base beer, and the Reserva seems to have much more of the yeasty sourness, which is largely lacking here. This is not a bad thing, as the beer itself has a lot going for it. The head retention adds a lot to both the appearance and mouthfeel, which definitely accentuates the overall experience. This beer is one I will look for in the future, another excellent offering from one of my favorite breweries.","kdb150","Aug 17, 2012"
4.23,1,4,3.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Bottled in 2011, poured into a wine glass. Dark brown pour, huge foamy head, takes some time to recede. Scents of brown sugar, whisky, malt, and an odd funkiness. Taste is quite different from the nose, suprisingly, notes of plum, light coffee, whisky, and oddly - carob, are most noticeable. It has a rather complex, slowly evolving mouthfeel. First are the sharp notes of whisky and dark fruit, then it quickly mellows into light coffee and carob. Well balanced mouthfeel, and thick but not too heavy with fine carbonation. The aftertaste lingers, where notes of roasted malt and minerals reveal themselves. I was really surprised by both this beers complexity and how much different the nose is from the taste. Highly recommended.","srv33","Aug 15, 2012"

There are no visible sediment grains. The aroma on this one is fantastic, like decadent baked goods. Sweet bready malts, raisins, tart black cherry, and caramel are all coming out. Taste: All of the aspects of the aroma are coming through as well as slight bitterness, earthiness, and Belgian yeast complimenting everything nicely. The finish is very complex tasting - can't quite put my finger on this new quality it introduces to the overall flavor and why it's so good. Mouthfeel - wow, I really like how this works - the beer coats and sticks to the mouth providing a pleasant tingling sensation, possibly due to the high alcohol content. Overall this is one of my favorite Belgian beers. It's odd that in my area it's not available at many places.... it belongs right next to the classics such as Delirium, Trappist beers, and so forth. Pick this up if you see it, as well as other De Dolle brews.","Neorebel","Apr 06, 2012"

Aroma of dark and light fruit, sour apples and cherries. Very dry dark and light fruit flavor. Complex flavor, but very subdued, finishes with a bit of alcohol and and a spicy, almost peppery hop bite. Medium bodied and surprisingly prickly carbonation considering the lack of a head. The dark body must block active carbonation that is not visible and clearly does not persist as foam. This is quite different; too dry for my taste, but I still enjoyed trying it.

It smells of yeast, cherries and a little like red wine- not a strong smell but very enjoyable and flavor enhancing. It tastes very strongly of sour cherries at first- very similar to Russian River's Consecration wild ale. The cherry persists throughout along with some malt and a hint of alcohol. Like all other De Dolle beers, Oerbier is very strongly carbonated (which personally I love) and not a beer you can drink really quickly. I highly recommend this beer.","Hopdaemon39","Jan 11, 2012"

It poured a dirty, murky raisin brown with a one finger toffee colored head. It smells of raisins, figs, plums, light toffee, and slight alcohol. This beer is very, very sweet. It tastes of very, very sweet raisins and dark malts. There is a boatload of dark fruits here. It drinks very smoothly and is between light and medium in body.

The taste is pretty malty with candied sugars, somewhat biscuity, and slight tart apples. The finish is rather dry. The mouthfeel is mostly dry and kind of hot, this one is a bit heavy.

Real smooth, creamy even, a dense medium body with a sweet edge of caramel and toffee, with some breadiness for malt balance and hints of roasted malt. This gives off a dry edge that works extremely well playing off the fruit flavors like orange, black cherry, some sour notes and even some citric hop bitterness on the backend - plus a touch of spice and pepper (clove?).

Flavor is apple, berry, raisin with some bitterness and an alcoholic finish. Its full-medium bodied and has a prickly amount of carbonation.

The beer is a deep, almost-purple brown with a ludicrous topography of beige suds that leaves lace chunks everywhere. The aroma is caramely at its base with accents of souring fruit, cocoa powder, cola, sherry, and a coppery metallic note. Flavor is sweet and spicy with a solid warming alcohol presence.

I know how to serve beer, the best temp to store and serve them at, etc., and I do all that. And I don't shake the things up before opening. So, as much as I absolutely love this brewery and its beers, I avoid them half the time because of the hassle and potential unpleasantness of the experience.

Its a very complex beer and as it warms, more of the malty sweetness comes out. Adding the yeast from the bottle is a nice treat and adds a cinnamon roll doughiness to the brew. This is an excellent beer and I wish I had more to lay down for a few years. A sipper for sure, the drinkability is only hindered by the high ABV.

The strange mascot, looking like a cross between the "Jeep" from Popeye and the Stay-Puff marshmellow man from Ghostbusters makes the bottle look cheesy and creepy at the same time. I do like the bowtie wrapper above the label, though. I feel the beer has dressed to impress. It pours a ruddy brown with a very thick, active, rocky tan head that oh so slowly works its way down. Daddy like. The smell is oranges, cinnamon, leather, raisins, and a surprisingly light flowery note. Holy guacamole. Good God. The taste doesn't dissapoint. It starts fruity and almost sweet, quickly fading to a chalky spice, nutmeg and cloves. A surprising coffee roast makes a brief appearance before plums and raisins come finish the day, but as sweet as you expect those flavors to be, they are dry and crisp. I REALLY have to stretch to find any room for improvement here. A touch sweeter and it would be heaven. OK, heaven plus, with it being merely heavn as it is. The mouthfeel is chewy, slick, and feather soft. The drinkability is beyond reproach.

I was expecting the same here, but the fact that this bottle is either mistreated or just old, really changes the perception and overall flavor profile. It's not particularly complex at this point, and I gather a fresh bottle yields a completely different experience. That being said, this particular bottle I had wasn't bad, and will compel me to find another bottle to try once again. At this point, it's a sipper to be sure.","ABCJiugui","Apr 08, 2008"

Dark murky copper brown with a seriously over-carbonated head. Aroma of yeast, spice and candy sugar. The flavor is so hard to taste with all these hairy bubbles going ape shit in my mouth. As the flavor emerges I sense overt yeasty spiciness, an acidic tartness, and definite alcohol presence. Body is hard to discern as well with all these bubbles. Finishes alcoholic and yeasty. I have had most of the De Dolle beers before (different bottlings, different ages) and this is a consistent experience: too much carbonation, overtly alcoholic and unbalanced and hard to swallow - it's almost like home brew gone really bad. If this stuff is so heavily coveted then we should all just go back to Stroh's.","dedrinker","Mar 12, 2008"

Aroma sharp sweetness with a pungent note of fruit tartness mild metallic noted and pure carbonation tickling the nose. Flavor is overtly alcoholic with a bland bitter dirty fruit and malt combo, heavy on tobacco leaf and earthiness very unbalanced with stale tasting hop notes, mild tart apple and acidic qualities added in. I don't wanna say infected but with carbonation like that and completely uncohesive flavors I'm floored. Mouthfeel is highly carbonated tickles the throat and dampers drinkability medium bodied overall.

Red bottle logo specifically states "9% alc./vol."... The taste also complements the hefty ABV with a noticeable alcohol presence underneath flavors of figs, prunes, malts, caramel, vanilla, and raisins... not my favorite beer from De Dolle, but a worthy sample nonetheless... good, creamy and rich mouthfeel, but drinkability took a hit due to the noticeable alcohol both in the flavor and taste... Also present is an undeniable essence of syrup, mollasses, and a medicinal-characteristic in the flavor... different... worth a try...

At first this beer just seems like a mixture of pale or pilsner malt with Belgian dark candi, but it becomes more complex as I drink on. The aroma is very sweet and bready, but with earthy spices. The main flavor is a big sweet caramel that quickly turns dry. Around the edges there are hints of cocoa, dates, and vanilla. Those little flavors are what set this beer apart from other dark Belgian as they're obvious enough to enjoy, you don't have to really dig deep to find them.

Nice aroma of cellared apples along with some light spice, and a touch of brown sugar. Taste is slightly sour to start and has elements of raisins, quince, cardomom, cream, and perhaps some sour cherries. Pretty nice. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy.

Poured a light brown that was almost cloudy with a few hues of red as I held it to the light. Very thick head that hung around and dissipated slowly. Aroma was not powerful but had a sweet malty smell. I immediately tasted sweet tea with citrus notes. I frothed it in my mouth vigorously and it literally exploded with additoional notes of orange and malty sweetness and other sugary characteristics that I have never tasted before. Almost fruity but more like raisins.Hops were almost non-existant as the alchhol was present but not dominating.

It smells nice and fruity with green apples, cherries, caramel, and maybe some spicy phenols. The flavor is about the same with the addition of pepper and some warmth. It has a medium to thick body that has good carbonation from the conditioning and becomes smooth.

Notes of muted dark malts and vinous, citrus rind; a bit perfumy and lightly hoppy, too. Spicing seems evident, although not likely so, probably a unique yeast strain. First sip is caramel-like; dark cherry-malty and smooth with a bit of botanical astringency and faint sourness in the finish. Very clean tasting; I'd recommend this to a red wine lover. Buttery, slick mouthfeel. Sadly, sulfites and I don't get along, I get headaches from the sulfites added to aid the fermentation of red wine, so I haven't had a glass of red wine in years. But this beer does seem to have some red wine qualities if I recall. Smoothness is impeccable. Drying on the palate long after the sip. We're getting this beer in stock at the pub where I work, so I've found my perfect substitute if I feel like in a red wine mood. 50 lashes if I sound like a wino; I've always preferred beer, but this beer's awesome in those instances when a substitute for a wine other than wine is in order (red meats and the like...).","crookedhalo","Sep 09, 2004"

The aftertaste lingers on and on and is actually quite annoying. I couldn't detect much else, though the thick mouthfeel indicates this has some alcohol to it.

As the pour had indicated, there's plenty of yeast in there, but also a profound malt depth of apples, lactic cherry yogurt, blood oranges and a sweetness closing to milk chocolate. Appealing complexity already, but further sniffs have even more to offer with hints of earth, oak and saw dust. Medium bodied and sparkling, initially cherry/apple sweet, but balanced by more sourness than expected. Aftertaste can't hide the age of the sample, a little off-flavour of something alike cement or dirty grass distracts a bit from the enjoyment.

A few small particles are churned about at the base of the goblet as tiny bubbles stream to the surface. The head retention is excellent, no doubt buoyed by its natural, effervescent carbonation; yet it leaves only transient lace. It's maltiness is evident in the nose, suggesting sugary candy, caramel, dried dark fruit, mustiness and soil as well as a splash of alcohol. The body is medium-full, and it's natural, effervescent carbonation foams up upon entering the mouth and lends a tingle to the tongue. It's rich, fruity malt dominates the flavor but some hops are able to slip through lending it a bit of a licorice note. Dark dried fruits (raisins, prunes), some yeasty phenolics, and a clear note of alcohol give it depth.

Retention is good and lacing is good, helping to save the look of the beer. This is an ugly beer, but that is not what matters. For some people, the natural appearance of this beer may be attractive...but these are the type of people who prefer their women unshaven:) Aroma is mouthwatering...sour green apples, apple cider, sangria, plenty of sourness and belgian funk. Mouthfeel is fizzy at first, then melds into a cloying wet finish with a medium-thin body despite it's obvious strength. Taste begins with lots of green apples and hard apple cider. The candi sugar makes itself very noticeable towards the middle with a ruddiness and some heavy fusel/acetyl alcohols are noted before the finish. The finish is cloying, with a persistant sweetness. Hops are minimal in flavor, aroma or bitterness. It burns as it goes down, and it will give one a decent buzz. This used to be one of my favorite beers of all-time 10 years ago...I remember this beer being more sour, less heavy on the fusels, and infinitely more drinkable. Perhaps the beer changed, but it's more likely that my tastes have changed. Still, it holds a sentimental place in my heart.","Mitchster","Apr 29, 2003"

3.43,-18.1,3.5,3,3.5,4,3.5,"The dark chestnut color was hidden by a thin white head that mostly faded and left some chunky lace as consumed. Lots of sediment clouded this brew but the active carbonation still managed to work its way thru it quickly. Maple and sour cherry dominated the aroma. The fruity tastes of cherrys and plums are strong but don't hide the alcohol very well. Altough i enjoyed this brew it did take awhile to drink.","paceyourself","Feb 22, 2003"
4.13,-1.4,4,3.5,4.5,4.5,4,"Major foam eruption upon pouring - head recedes to a fluid mass of tiny bubbles that blankets the beer and remained when it was ( sadly) gone, clinging to the chalice. Deep, clear copper color with dark granular yeast clumped in the bottom and surprisingly little cloudiness. Musty, wine like aroma with definite notes of sour and fresh fruit. Flavor changes to tart, fresh fruit; melon and raisin mix with firm hop bittering and a hint of smoked nuts. Full bodied mouth feel with a finish that explodes with hop charactor and searing alcohol that reminds me of vodka. Rich and fruity, solidly hoppy and warmingly alcoholic. De Dolle, like De Ranke are 2 of my De Favorite breweries!","Shiredave","Feb 09, 2003"
4.37,4.3,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,"Bracing, bold, and delicious! My guess on the style would be either a high-alcohol brown ale, or maybe a souped-up Scotch, either way, several notches above what I'd expect. At 7.7%, I'm starting to feel it, too! Wonderful, chewy texture, full body, altogether excellent! Much thanks to Marc77 for making this possible!","feloniousmonk","Feb 06, 2003"

3.96,-5.5,5,4,4,4,3.5,"Thanks for the recommendation, StevieW!! This is indeed an exceptional beer (even amongst many other Belgian beers). Poured an unbelievable head (I waited about 10 minutes to start drinking it!). I can't call it lace, because the foam covered my glass all the way through until I finished it. Amber color, spicy and smooth. Reminded me of Maudite (and maybe Kwak). Creamy and delicious. As is the case with many Belgian beers, it is a little on the sweet side. If you love Belgian beer and haven't had this yet, find it.","JohnnyDuvel","Jan 01, 2003"

3.83,-8.6,4.5,4,4,4,3,"Hazy dark cider color with fluffy head, mild yeasty aroma with hints of overripe peaches and grapes. Lots of candy sugar flavors here, a very light sourness hidden at the back, smooth finish with little residuals except for sugar. This is quite a hearty beer, big sugary malts and very little hops except for perhaps a tart green apple quality. A good beer but almost too sweet and sugary for me; maybe a big plate of bloody meat would have made me appreciate this beer more than just drinking it solo.","Thrasher","Nov 15, 2002"
4.28,2.1,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,"Dark brown with all kinds of floaties.  Uncontrollable head.  Sweet malty aroma, heavy on the dark candied fruits.  Starts off sweet with dried apricots, plums, and cherries.  Turns mildly cidery, a bit lactic.  Nice full mouthfeel.   Not too much different than other Belgian dark strong ales that have a high concentration of dark candi sugar, in a good way.","pbrian","Sep 30, 2002"
3.88,-7.4,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Turbid garnet in hue, topped by a typically dense off white head that dissipates at a painfully slow rate.  The aroma is comprised of tart fruit esters accompanied by powdery dry cocoa and subdued bubblegum.  An enticing nose, but not quite as aromatic as other examples of the style.  Flavorwise, candy - like sweetness is quickly followed by mellow chocolate and banana esters.  A hint of bubblegum is present as well.  Moderate in body, w/ an agreeable mouthfeel that adds to the drinkability.  Finishes w/ quickly fading residual sweetness and trace phenol.  Oerbier is certainly a tasty brew, but it seemed to fall a bit short on the depth of flavor and complexity I was craving. Like a good dark strong, the sweetness was well controlled and not cloying, however.  I look forward to their Stille Nacht.","marc77","Aug 13, 2002"
4.12,-1.7,4,4.5,4,4,4,"Interesting brew, some along of a Belgian Red Ale, firm choc maltiness, balanced with a nice cherry like acidic sourness, very different and creative beer.","rastaman","Jul 11, 2002"
4,-4.5,4,4,4,4,4,"Incredible thick clingy head with nice fingers similar to their Stille Nacht.  Sweet candy/sugar flavors.  Nicely malty and no real bitterness to be found.  Overall a good beer, but I much prefer the Stille Nacht.","jreitman","May 05, 2002"
4.92,17.4,4.5,5,5,4.5,5,"My oh my this beer brought me to my knees, last had this one in a beer bar in Brussels called La Porte Noire (sp?) which is located in an 1800's brick cellar. Nice to see that we can get it in the states now.","Jason","Oct 19, 2001"
4.45,6.2,4,4,4.5,4.5,5,"Had this one at t'Brugs Beertje, here's my notes: dark ripe fruits, some dextrin sweetness, semi-sour, vinous qualities, very raisiny with slight burnt characters. Now that was day 3 in Belgium and after many (MANY) beers. I do remember it being one of the best that I tried. All of De Dolle's brew are.","Todd","Mar 22, 2001"
