"Not really a big fan of dark beers but I liked the mouthfeel who stays a long time!"

"Nice beer, little over carbonated but excellent taste. Couldn´t chat with the pink elephant, maybe you need a few."

"One of my all time favorites."

"Not sure why this is rated so high. As soon as i opened the bottle i couldn't get the head to calm its shit. finally started pouring it. looks super dark which you would think would be a good sign. taste isnt all that great unless you like copper. and it doesnt feel smooth at all. too bubbly and feels more like drinking a soft drink. i disapprove..."

"Poured several fingers of tan head, great retention and light lacing. Darker brown and some cloudiness, with some orange shining through. Smells like brown sugar and malt with hints of apple. Tastes fruity--pears and pineapple, with notes of cherries and apple. Brown sugar appears most as an after-taste. Medium bodied and doesn't present much for a lingering sensation. Light carbonation feel. Overall, I like it quite a bit as a unique style, although it doesn't seem much like a traditional Belgian. Some sort of hybrid. Very pleasant, yet expensive, so I'll buy again, just not that often."
"I've had a long relationship with this Champ. Excels both in Flavor and Buzz."

"This one was built up a lot by stores we frequent. It's a nice, standard, darker belgian, but is nothing special. Smooth and good taste."

"O: One of my favorites now. As someone else pointed out, it's a great deep blend without a single sharp note."

"Pours a cloudy dark reddish brown color with off-white head. Dark fruits, spice, anise, and caramel on the nose; follows onto the palate. Very complex, very good."
"Never had this one before.  Dark cola with HUGE head.  Lots of cling.  Smell sucks, as it is cellarish and musty.  Probably too cold.  Taste is very nice.  Big malt, lots of belgian yeast.  Mouth is medium to heavy, way huge carb and good balance.  Not a session beer, but nice to try."

"Like the regular D. T. Better"
"This pours a dark translucent colour with about a finger width of tannish head that stuck around.  The nose came forward with some dark fruit and sweet molasses and maybe a bit of maple around the edges.  I was really looking forward to diving into this.  Unfortunately was a bit underwhelmed with the flavour. Some of the same notes came forward on the tongue, but there was a grassiness that overpowered those notes.  I thought maybe I had the beer a bit too cold and let it warm up before taking some further sips.  This did bring forward some of those flavours but only slightly.  It was still a good beer but was expecting a little bit more of a flavour profile based on the nose."

"Poured a dark and murky brown; sticky, creamy, tan 2 inch head; cream lace on glass; good retention; tight bubbly surface remained on the beer throughout consumption. Smelled like prunes, candied prunes, brown yeasty bread, burnt sugar malt. Tasted like burnt sugar, burnt molasses, spiced burnt malt, yeast, brown sugar, pretzel bread, and brown spice bread; the aftertaste was sweet with an ever slight hop taste, but almost not noticeable. Just noticeable when the beer warmed a bit. The higher alcohol was well-hidden, but it came through just a little. The mouthfeel was full bodied but light a sense; carbonation was on the medium side. It wasn't dry, in fact it was wet; quaffable, definitely! This was a very delicious brew!"

"Review based on the BJCP2008 guidelines (style 18E). Bottle 33 cl - Batch L13_14_184. AROMA: complex malty aromas with caramel and bready notes, mixed with faint esters and a background floral aroma. spicy alcohols present. no discernible noble hop aromas. APPEARANCE: deep amber color and translucid. medium ivory head with below average retention. some lacing. TASTE: mild flavours of toast and dried grapes. the alcohols are present with an almost solventy character, with spicy notes. low bitterness with a medium-dry finish. PALATE: medium-light body with average carbonation. OVERALL: a dark belgian strong ale that showed promise on the aromas but didnt deliver on the flavours. needs more complexity."

"This was lovely. A friend shared it with me and we drank it straight from the bottle, so this isn't a proper review, but I really enjoyed it. Fizzy and fairly light tasting, although my friend found it too boozy."

"Dark brown pour with a two-finger off-white and foamy head. Aroma of bread and dark fruit. Taste has sweet bready malt and light clove flavors upfront. Medium body also has some hints of plum, raisin, alcohol and yeast."

"This is an extremely well-crafted beer.  It scores well in all categories.  My only issue with this beer is purely personal preference on flavor.  To me, the flavor is somewhere around a lighter porter with apricot flavoring.  So, if you like that flavor, it's a great beer.  If you don't like that flavor, it's still a great beer for tasting and craft purposes."

"Payed $11 for a 750ml and expected a beer with ridiculous flavor. The beer to me was not as great as it was build up to be. Sure this was a great buy, but not worth the price to me. Still worth trying it if you haven't yet."

"The taste is similar to the aroma with a bevy of overripe dark fruits, sweet roasted malts, and a low to modest hop bitterness that fills it out at the end.  So I say à bientôt (see you later) and I'm off to enjoy this one with dinner."

"I picked this up at a local Spec's after seeing it online a few times. I thought this was a pretty good beer overall, but after a while the herbal and spice flavorings made me like it less and less. However, I would drink it again as it was something different and still good."
"Overall, I like it but the flavours are a bit on the mild side. I think this is a bottle from 2010."

"An absolute favorite ale from Huyghe brewery. Pours a dense dark brown with a big foamed tan head that dies down to a nice layer with excellent lacing. Nose of dark fruits---plum and raisins, light Belgian yeast and Belgian candy malt. Taste is excellent. Plum and raisins sizzle into the flavor profile with this highly carbonated Belgian delicacy, cola and cherry tastes to the side. Aftertaste of cherries and cola. If one ever has a chance I would suggest trying it on tap----an absolutely fantastic Belgian ale."

"This was a really good beer. I enjoyed the taste and the aroma that it had. It has a smooth taste. The taste and smell was not too strong or too light. I enjoyed this beer very much. If tou have never had this beer before you should try it at least once. I know that I will have another one of these beers."

"Pours a dark black with a retaining one finger head. Dark and malty to the nose with hints of sweetness and coffee. It goes down smooth. Starts sweet and ends malty. The aftertaste leaves a little booziness stuck to the back of your tongue. It's a pretty good beer. Not as great as I would have expected. The taste leaves a little to be desired. Don't get me wrong, it's a solid beer. But it doesn't do enough for me taste wise to warrant an outstanding rating."
"O: Enough complexity to keep me interested, especially after the beer warms and opens up. Enjoyable and easy to drink though the alcohol could be a little better hidden in my opinion. Definitely an enjoyable beer and one that I grab every once in a while."
"Also - The review below me with the 1.9 rating... This is a beer for a seasoned Belgian drinker. It is not a first timer. If you are looking to get into Belgian Quads, Triples, etc. Try Gulden Draak, Piraat, Duvel. All will give you a welcome into the region. Once your ""sweet rum tongue"" gets used to the flavors exhibited.... the good ones like Rochefort for example... will fill your shelves."

"Like I said I have just started drinking beers from Germany/Belgium, I am mostly a Rum drinker myself, I do enjoy Stella, Weihenstephaner, Leffe, and Hofbrau, I just don't understand all the hype behind this brew. It really was awful, it wasn't so bad that I poured it down the sink, but I will definitely stay away from this brew. I chose this over Delirium Noel and will stay away from the Delirium brand of beers from now on. I am now on the last drop from bottle, I was so upset that I paused what I was doing to write this review and warn others. For 5$ a bottle this is just no worth it, it would be worth it for 5 cents a bottle, save your money and try something else out."

"Interesting beer. It's not sweet and rich like some other beers in this style. It reminds me a bit of Trois Pistoles from Unibroue, only I get no alcohol warmth nor lingering fruity sweetness. A good beer, but not one I'll reach for again."

"While I encountered some flavors I didn't personally care for, I have a hard time faulting the entirety of this brew since there is a fair amount here to like. Worth trying, but if I want a Belgian Strong Dark Ale, I'll reach for a McChouffe."

"Poured from the nifty faux ceramic bottle into a goblet. Color is a murky root beer brown with some reddish tint. Fairly aggressive khaki head that leaves a nice spidery lacing on the glass. Aroma is a well-integrated blend of dark fruits (raisins, dates, cherries), toffee, corn flakes, molasses, clove, hot alcohol. Smells rich and spicy, sweet and only subtly roasted. Semi-chewy or moderately thick body, coats the mouth and leaves a lingering sweetness along with an almost soapy residue. Palate recalls same elements as the nose along with medicinal orange, tobacco, chocolates from one of those mixed boxes (maraschino cherry in particular), wood, floral soap, sesame, light roast or green coffee bean. Wonderfully sweet, nutty, and dessert-like yet the alcohol burn intensifies as the sips accumulate. As good as its lighter and better known stablemate. If I was going to nitpick I'd say that the alcohol is a tad hot and spicy, but my evaluation of this characteristic is partly mood-dependent ... Sometimes the Belgian booze hits that spot square on."

"Interesting aromas and taste, sweet malty molasses rule the roost with all the flavours dominated by the strength and depth of them. They have hoofed in some spices to make it different from other brews in this style and it's rich enough body wise too: there just seems to be something unbalanced and wrong somewhere. Maybe the alcohol level is too high for me or it lacks a subtle bitterness most in this type of brew usually have."

"Fairly disappointed with this one... I like Belgian Ales in general"

"Overall: OK beer, nothing really stands out about it, well made but overall kind of bland. $12.49 for 750ml bottle."

" The Belgians do it again! This is a wonderful beer. Very complex and full of flavor. This is a sipping beer as you want to enjoy it. And you best as it is very highly priced. You can tell that this is a craft beer that the brewer put everything into. I look at this the same way I would look at a meal prepared by a professional chef; bordering on art. I can't say that I will buy this very often, mainly due to the price, but would love to share with some friends."

"O-A slow sipper. Tasty. A must try. Would only buy here and there, it is an acquired taste. A bit sour. Too many raisin, cherry aftertastes going on that feel like said fruits were dipped in spiked molasses. Very sweet. I really like the look, so bold and dark with ruby highlights. A head isn't needed. Sips like liqueur. And the fuzzy, bubbly sensation on tongue and down the chest is amazing. Warming."

"750 ml bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 3/7/2013. Pours fairly crystal clear deep ruby brown color with a 2 finger fairly dense and rocky khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Spotty foamy lacing clings on the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of pear, apple, raisin, caramel, toast, brown sugar, chocolate, cocoa, brown bread, pepper, coriander, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of malt and fruity/spicy yeast notes; with good strength. Taste of big brown bread, pear, apple, raisin, caramel, brown sugar, toast, chocolate, cocoa, coriander, licorice, pepper, clove, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Lingering notes of brown bread, light fruits, caramel, toast, brown sugar, chocolate, cocoa, coriander, pepper, clove, and herbal on the finish for a good bit. Fantastic complexity and balance of malt and fruity/spicy yeast flavors; with a good malt/yeast flavor balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. High carbonation and medium bodied; with a lightly slick, crisp, and prickly mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is a highly excellent Belgian strong dark ale! All around great complexity and balance of dark malt and fruity/spicy yeast flavors; and very smooth and crisp to sip on for the ABV. A highly enjoyable offering."

"330 ml. bottle. brwon colour, with a big whtie head that does not hold for too long, but leaves a good lace. Smell of chocolate, dried fruits (figs, plums), liquorice, cherries and spices. Surprisingly, the body is not as strong as I was hoping. Taste is the same as smell; dried fruits, chocolate, spices and liquorice. It reminds too of some liquor that Ican't remember now. One that I can repeat, and hoping it will be soon."

"Poured from a 330ml bottle. Pours a reddish chestnut brown. The nose offers up an array of bright fruit notes typical of the style. The taste is not surprisingly fairly boozy with fruity and candy notes dominating. It's surprisingly easy drinking and light-bodied for its ABV."

"O - I love the bottling and labeling of Delirium brews and this ale backs all that Belgian brilliance up. A must try for any Belgian ale fanatic. Ill drink this any time. There are better Belgian strong dark ales, but this is a fine Belgian dark ale and has a freaking pink elephant on an egg shell bottle and purple foil. This is Belgian at some of its best. Delirium beers are something no beer lover should miss"

"Very nice with a great, smooth feel that went down easy considering the high alcohol content and had some very pleasant fruit touches. Not quite as good Delirium Tremens but a very good beer none the less and one that I'm likely to pick up again at some point."

"o: a great dark ale, probably the first route of exposure to the style for many, that is often ignored because of its ubiquity - but that’s definitely worth a retry"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I may prefer a Tremens more as of now, which may be due to having it on tap at Delirium Café in Brussels, but every time I have a Nocturnum I like it more. It may be growing on me and become a regular purchase. A very smooth, refreshing, dangerously sweet beer."

"Pours a clear orange-brown with a foamy beige head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, brown sugar, and dark fruits. Taste is much the same with a fruity flavor on the finish. There is a mild amount of spice bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer that is tasty and easy to drink."
""
""
"Maybe this isn't the best example of the style, but it remains a classic for good reason, I think. This is a big beer and is to be taken slowly. Definitely worth putting in the cellar or trying fresh."

"This is a solid example of the style, but nothing that will blow anyone away. Worth checking out for sure!"
""
""
""

"O: Easy to drink back, with a solid Belgium yeast presences with fruity notes and malt sweetness. A good beer, but not a great beer on account of the mild flavours and smell."

"O - This is definitely an attractive beer, first and foremost, with a gorgeous color and full head. While I can definitely say I enjoyed it and would drink it again in the future, the aroma and taste disappeared too quickly to make this anything more than slightly above average."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The characteristics (color, smell) of the beer were nice right up to the point of tasting. There was an overwhelming metallic taste. I fear this was an off bottle, nonetheless I was forced to offer the remainder to the Plumbing Gods."

"Overall, this is a well-balanced brew.... Usually, Belgians are.... However, I'm a bit critical of Belgian brews since they're my favorite.... It's not on the the level of ""Tremens"" by any means.... Definitely different, but not as good overall.... It's not even that good for a Belgian, in general.... On the grand scheme of things, it's still a delicious and easy-drinking beer.... Just not by my own ""Belgian"" standards."
""
""
""
""
"O: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, good kick, good representation of style, this is a solid darker Belgian beer to drink for a while."
""
""
"Color is dark yet cloudy brown. The aroma hits strong with plum and maybe a tiny bit of citrus. The flavor is the same but intense. Lots of flavor up front that lingers on the tongue. The body seems just a tiny bit thin but still good. At 8.5% a few of these WOULD make you have some crazy dreams."

""

""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I just tried the Delirum Tremens, and it came up a slightly lesser Duvel. This beer bears immediate comparison to Gulden Draak, and again, for me at least, it falls slightly short - on its own merits, a must try - but as a BSDA, maybe a little too light on the palate and flavor profile. I expect a heartier ale in a dark Belgian."

""
"An interesting beer here. Very fruity and malty in the profile, with a raisin-like dryness. It shows a very good complexity, and is nicely balanced. Hops are overall light, yeast is present but not too assertive. Worth trying, it is a great example of the style."

"O - This beer drinks well and goes well after a meal, although the sweetness is intense and the body is a bit heavy on carbonation for my tastes. If I am to spend $4+ on a 330ml bottle, I will look elsewhere."
""
""
"Pours dark with a big white fluffy head and smells of fig and raisins. Medium-light mouthfeel with good carbonation. Alcohol taste is slightly noticeable, but otherwise tastes like it smells: figs, raisins, a bit of yeast. Good, but I think there are better choices in this style, especially for the price. The flavor is not as bold as I had hoped, and it almost seems a little watered down. Still, my favorite of the Deliriums."
""

""
""
"I was excited about trying this beer, since I had always seen it in stores without really knowing what it was, and I have only recently gotten into Belgian Strong Dark Ales. Overall, it is a very good beer, but not as good as I was expecting. This beer definitely needs to be enjoyed on the warmer side. My first pour was way too cold, and it wasn't until it had sat out of the bottle for about 30 minutes that it really came into its own. Decent, but there are definitely much better examples of the style."

"Unfortunatly the head fizzed away and when that happens I am always afraid that I have harmed the beer in smell and flavour as well... Anyway this is a very decent Belgian dark ale, not the best but I would not mind drinking this again as today's hot summer evening was not very ideal for such a beer."

"Pour is light, slightly translucent brown. Light white head floats on top. The smell is the normal light Belgian Delirium yeast, but theres a nice addition of roasted malt. Not alot going on in the taste. Like Delirium Tremens, only with a bit of roasted malt that kind of detracts from the light balance of Delirium Tremens. Slight metallic flavor pervades."

"o - seems to represent the style well but not particularly enjoyable for me. i wouldn't turn it down, but i doubt i'd seek this out again."
"It smells like black licorice and Belgian yeast - very nice. Taste is good, but a little disappointing considering the lead-up. Some black licorice, sour cherry, yeast, and others I can't put my finger on. Mouthfeel is slightly oily, medium-bodied, very fizzy. Overall, not bad, but I guess it just isn't my cup of tea."

"Honestly, I'm a bit let down. While there are some wonderful raisin, fig and cherry flavors, they're cut short by the metallic taste from the alcohol. In some beers that flavor can enhance even but here it just detracts from the experience. I also would have liked a bit more ""Belgian"" in my Belgian Strong Dark Ale. Some of my favorite yeast flavors weren't here and this just seemed like a cleaned up version of the style. It's alright but it's not that great."
"OVERALL: Not my favourite flavour profile but a decent beer I guess. Good winter warmer but the last thing you'd want to drink on a sticky summer evening."

"O- This was an enjoyable belgian strong dark ale. My first delirium and I was impressed. Definitely on the sweet side for a beer, but well balanced and well executed beer that has a fairly strong abv but is still very enjoyable to drink. I would recommend picking a bottle up and trying it out."
""
""
""
""
""
"D - The harsh metallic finish just drags this one down for me. This is otherwise a fine BSDA, but the aftertaste just ruins the flavor profile. Not sure if it's an old bottle or just a poor beer. Maybe one I'll have to consider retrying."

"Not to forget, the alcohol was present in this but didn't detract at all from the mouthfeel of this beer. There could have been a notch more of carbonation in this but on its own, this had a quiet strength to it that became more apparent as I downed it. Not a lot of sweetness here but there's lots to like if you like your Belgian yeast without a lot of accompanying spice."

""

"O: Excellent strong dark Belgian ale. Great flavors and aromas."
""
"Poured from bottle to Duvel tulip the beer arrives a rich brown with a 2 finger khaki colored head with good retention and lacing, looks good. The nose is toasted malts with a bit of dark fruit to accompany the belgian yeast. Similarly the flavor begins with a toasted malt and caramel sweetness. Mildly bitter. The dark fruit aspects blends well with the toasty sweetness and belgian yeast. Finishes sweet with a creamy mouthfeel. Medium bodied and well carbonated. Overall, this is a very good beer. I would happily purchase again."

"Pours dark brown, extremely cloudy, with a one finger head which dissipates fast. Smells of cherries, vanilla, and plum powder (a sweet and sour powder used by adding water to make American Chinese, plum or sweet and sour sauce- sort of an artificial child’s candy smell), prunes, candy orange. Tastes of well mixed version of all the flavours just mentioned, all hitting the mouth at once, followed by a sweet, then sour flavour, then a watery watered down version of the above which dissipates to nothing. Also tasted candied peaches, and a slight liquorice, and a medicinal flavour. Definitely sweet, but not overpoweringly in my opinion. Light to medium bodied. Low to medium carbonation. Tasted better the longer I drank it. Overall, not what I was hoping for in a Belgian Strong Dark Ale, but is a nice drink."

""
""

"O: Not the best, not the worst. Kind of a disappointment, really. I would take a Unibroue Terrible any day over this."

"It must be a bad bottle, I'll revisit it again as Tremens is one of my all time favorites."

""
""
""

"Beer is medium to light in body, sweet up front with a lot of carbonation, the yeast comes through nicely, it is a decent beer. I remember the very first time I had this beer about 10 years ago. I ordered it in a bar and the bar tender told me I had to drink it with respect because it was the oldest family run brewery in the world. Not sure why the lack of diversification in that family demands respect, but apparently it does, the history aside, this is a fine beer. The archetype for the style for sure. I'm sure I'll have this again in the future."
""
""
"Overall - A great beer, maybe not the best dark ale in the world, but definitely right up there."
""
""

"Dark raisin brown in color. Poured with a thick beige foam that quickly dissipated with no cap or lacings. Sweet dark fruit aromas with a light booziness as it warmed. Smooth, mellow feel with light carbonation. Sweet dark fruit flavor up front with hop spice through the that carries to the end. Finishes with a sweet booziness and pleasant spicy, floral hop character."
"1.5 finger head on a clear amber and brown body. Decent lacing. Aroma is mostly sour dark fruit with some spice and Belgian yeast. Flavor is more of the same with sour but drinkable dark fruit, touch of cocoa and nice malt backbone. Medium body and moderate carbonation."
""
""
"Pours a dark brown with a two-finger cream colored head. Sticks around a while. Aroma of pear, apples, bits of dark fruit, toffee and some alcohol, tad medicinal. Toffee and caramel malt led the flavor profile. As it warmed, estery, fruity with both light and dark fruit notes. Light hops on the finish with a bit of booze."

"Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Pours a very dark red brown amber. Massive carbonation, overflowed the bottle on opening. Large light brown head that slowly dissipated leaving lacing. Aroma of dark and light fruit, Belgian spice and yeast, malt. Taste is dark fruit and malt, light brown sugar. Flavor somewhat attenuated on the finish. Overall pleasant and interesting, but the intensity of the flavor is somewhat lacking. Light to medium mouth feel. A pleasant Belgian ale."

"A cloudy, dark, reddish-brown liquid with a healthy puff of light tan head that receded to a patchy layer and left a bit of soapy lacing on the glass. Aroma of dark sugars, malts, some cocoa hints, and some herbal/earthy hop notes. Taste is sugary, nutty, caramel, bready yeast, bakers' chocolate, hints of dark dried fruits, earth, herbal hops. Medium body, easily drinkable, very nice overall."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Enjoyable, but not my favorite dark belgian. I would give this beer a higher rating if there were more malt induced flavors as opposed to the heavy influence of the yeast. Still a good beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours very dark and starts with a nice tan head. Good retention and some clingy lacing on the way down. The nose carries a light bight of anise alongside dark fruits. The flavor does a good job mixing the black-licorice character with the more-common dark fruit elements. The anise character presents a nice dryness and spark to the mouthfeel. No real alcohol presence. Quite good."
"O: Pretty damn good. Benchmark of the style."
""
""
"O: I really enjoy this - though it must be known that it takes a bit of time sitting before it moves from good (at first) to great (which it ultimately is). Still, I'd definitely give it a second chance...even at $10 a bottle."
""
""
""
""

"I find this beer fairly unpleasant. It's interesting, but the yeast is just excessive. At least, I assume it's a mix of excessive yeast and some citrusy hops that's giving it that rotten apricot flavour. Whatever it is, it's over the top. It's starting to taste a little more like fruit and a little less like fungus as I drink, but not enough to change my mind about it. It's really hard for me to discern anything else in the beer. I'm not sure whether there's not much else to it or if it's because other flavours are just being overwhelmed by my dislike of this particular flavour. This is a little better than the Delirium Tremens, which had that same over-the-top rotted fruit flavour to it. This one at least is a dark ale and has some maltiness that accompanies that kind of flavour a little better than in a pale ale. It's still over-the-top, though. Won't be buying this again. This stuff ain't cheap."
""
""
"The beer is hazy and brown with hints of ruby. The beige head is about a half inch thick and leaves plenty of lacing in its wake. The aroma offers Belgian yeast, sweet malt, caramels, alcohol. Lots of yeast comes through. Sweet caramels soaked in alcohol. A present sweetness exists throughout. Distinctly Belgian, with dark fruits and light spices. Medium bodied with moderately high carbonation. Alcoholic warmth is there, most notably in the finish. Overall, a tasty brew. I would have this again."

"O: smooth, creamy. Definitely a sipping beer."

"Overall, this is a well above average beer. For a dark Belgian ale, I'd say it's worth the price you'd probably find it for at most places (about $12 for a pint at my local liquor store). I'll admit I'm not as familiar as I should be with this type of style, but it's a really solid beer, and one I'd recommend to people."

"O - A very complex yet approachable Belgian. Not the absolute pinnacle, but definitely high in the ranks!"

"A very dark amber beer with a thin head. Tastes are spicy, burnt sugars, caramel and white grape. Really smooth and enjoyable. The mouthfeel is a little thin compared to some other dark Belgian beers, but Nocturnum only comes in at 8.5% ABV. Has a dry finish on the pallet."
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours dark reddish color with thin light tan head. Some lacing. Smells nice with lots of ripe fruit and yeast. Taste was o.k. Sweet up front with the usual banana and other ripe fruit. Not sure if I had a bad bottle but there was a strange stale aftertaste. Mouthfeel was a little watery and not much carbonation. Overall I did'nt care for this particular bottle. I will try it again when I find some more and adjust my review."

"I highly recommend the Delirium Nocturnum to anyone looking to try an excellent beer."
""
"After sampling this beer, I have once again reassured myself that it is indeed my favorite. I couldn't bring myself to rate the Nocturnum as anything less than perfect and I have no reason to as I've never enjoyed anything more. Among the most complex of beers I've encountered but perfect in every aspect. I would be hard-pressed to find a beer that I would hold in as high regard as the Nocturnum. Truly world class among world class brews."
""
""
"D - I think I'm gonna sip on this one."
""
""
""
""
""
"Had this on tap at the Delirium Café in Brussels - was even more malty and far less sweet if I remember well. However, the bottle is here to stay and really stands out as one of my favorite beers. It's very hard for anyone NOT to enjoy this beer, as it is dark enough for stout fans, bitter enough for hopheads, sweet enough for dessert freaks, and alcoholic enough for drunkards. Truly a beer that is an inspiration to many beer-lovers such as myself. Bow down to one of the kings of beer."

"O: A very tasty and easy drinking Belgian Dark Strong Ale. Dark fruits are plentiful and spicing is very balanced and not overwhelming. Excellent yeast notes and 8.5% abv is not noticeable."
"Overall: Nocturnum is at the top of the food chain when it comes to beer. You will either like it or love it, there is no hate when it comes to drinking Nocturnum."
""

"O - Wow, I think this has got to be one of the best Belgian strong dark ales I've ever had (and I've had quite a few). Incredibly smooth, drinkable and complex. It goes down like a charm and still looks good even after I've drunk most of it."

""
"Prosit!"
"O Solid brew but overall i found it to be a little too sweet for my taste."
"O - Overall, not a bad beer, but I was underwhelmed."
"This beer goes down very easily at first, but the ABV soon makes it a sipper. Definately worth another try."
"O - this is light a high octane liquid candy, very sweet and decadent with a soul warming quality"
"i remember having this years ago and being very impressed. i have now tried it again and assumed i wouldn't have been quite as impressed now that i have tried such a vast variety of Belgian ales. i am glad to say that this beer truly stands up to the test of time and is just as rich and flavorful as it always has been. good stuff to have on occasion!"
"Overall: Very good beer overall. I'm not sure if I like it more than Delirium Tremens, but I think it's definitely in the same class. I would definitely recommend giving this one a shot."
"D - Great drink; another Brouwerji classic; Belgian Strong Dark Ale done right, great balance of feel and flavor; highly recommended to all Dark Ale fans"
"As I said: strange. Unfortunately, I expect it might also be estranging."
"I tend to get long winded but there just isn’t much to say here. It’s a dark beer without much head and looks rather thin and watery. Smells of dark fruits, spices, and alcohol and not much else. The flavors are about the same. This beer is trying to be a fruit beer/malternative but there’s enough dark malts and beer like flavors to save it. The after taste here is just awful beyond all else. It has an almost medicinal and artificial fruit flavor. I can't imagine how this flavor doesn't put people off. This isn’t good, it is frankly bad."
"O - Have sampled Delirium Tremens on many occasions in the past so was very happy to finally get to try this one. The flavours here are fairly clearly defined with all the hallmarks of the style there in spades. I'm not a big cherry fan though so this doesn't really hit the spot with me but a solid beer regardless."
"Final Notes: Yet another delicious Belgian brew. Sweet, fruity, and warming. Excellent dessert beer or a great choice to warm you up by the fireplace."
"Overall: Not bad, not great"
"O: This one is tasty. I remember this one being different, however, so maybe this is an old bottle. I'll have to revisit one that I know is fresh."
"O- A pretty damn good Dark Belgian, the flavor is great on this and it's nice to see one done with a lighter, more tart fruitiness."
"Plenty of charisma, albeit some grating characteristics. Definitely on the sourer side for a Belgian Strong Dark Ale and I'm not 100% sure that's what's intended. Keen to review this again, because I'm not convinced this has been well transported and/or stored and remember it being better when I first tried it a few years ago."
"Poured a beautiful amber/ruby color, releasing some great fruit flavors and sweet notes. The taste was reminiscent of apricots and prosciutto. It was delightful going down with a very pleasant mouthfeel even though it was very light and sweet."
"O - A tasty dark Belgian with loads of flavour. Definitely worth taking for a spin, but be prepared for some bold flavours."
"Not great, but ok. Worth a try. Some good elements, but nothing I'd want again. I'm pretty kind in the ratings"
"The body feels a bit thin, just a touch, but there is a good level of effervescence to back it up, bolstering the mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very solid BSDA. Nothing about it blows me away, but its certainly enjoyable to drink."
"Big beer, nicely carbonated a bit chewy. The alcohol comes through maybe just a touch too much, but nothing overwhelming."
"Medium thickness on the mouthfeel that is fairly drinkable for the abv. Excellent brew."
"O- Nice beer, worth picking up if you haven't had it. This isn't nearly as good as Rochefort 8 though, and that's the standard for me."
"Overall: A good solid Belgian beer is presented in this one. Definitely a must try."
"D: Will try again down the road maybe it will be better."
"Mouthfeel is full with perfect-to-style, huge carbonation. Great overall texture and body with a nice long, lingering finish. I honestly have never had this beer before (it's one of those constantly overlooked because it is readily available at most stores) and I was pleasantly very surprised. This is a great Belgian and worth its reputation."
"O: I like this beer a lot. Do I love it like I love Delirium Tremens? No. That’s a pretty high bar to set, though. This is definitely complex in a way that so many Belgian Strong Ales aren’t, but it still won’t ever match my affection for Tremens. That being said, they’re different styles, and it’s exciting to explore a favorite brewery in a way you haven’t yet experienced. I guess Noël’s next, right?"
"The beer pours out as a nice reddish brown color with an off white head that leaves just a ring around the glass. The smell has some heavy booze aromas and a pretty good amount of dark fermented fruits and Belgian yeast. The taste of the beer at first had a very strong metallic flavor, made me think I bit my lip and I was bleeding or something. That taste started to fade as the beer warmed up but wasn't as bad either as long as I was eating. The mouthfeel is on the lighter side but had a good amount of carbonation. Overall I would like to try this again, just has to be at the right time."
"Overall: A very tasty and solid dark Belgian ale."
"O: Overall very good, but it seems to lacks bit of the complexity I expect from the style., and shows a touch of booze in it. Still A damn fine brew."
"This is a very beautiful beer in the glass, with a thick tawny and rocky head and a deep amber opaqueness. The nose is very estery, but not all that complex, and is the weakest aspect of the beer overall. The taste, though, is very nice, with some great dark fruitiness followed by a lingering dry burn. Overall, the beer seems a bit light in mouthfeel compared to other strong dark ales, but it is very enjoyable nonetheless."
"D: Hides the alcohol very well, and the smoothness makes it go down really easy. I could drink a lot of this over the course of a night."
"Dr: Brilliant. Not cheap, but certainly worth it, just maybe not in Ireland! You'd never know it was 8.5%. A fruit beer with cajones. Definitely give this one a pour, lads. You won't be disappointed."
"Overall, how this monster of a beer snuck by me is a mystery, Ida flavorful, well balanced and a looker, plus the bottle is cool. It's great, I need more..."
"This is an interesting BSDA. It's like they threw in the whole kitchen sink, all at one time. Some things seem to meld together, others don't. Try it out for yourself."
"Very drinkable greatly designed beer. A must try!"
"Poured from the bottle into a standard pint glass. Dark red to brown color with a tan head that crowned the beer and left little lacing. Smell is generally malty with some spice. Dark fruits and some slight floral notes present as well. Taste is primarily dark fruits and spice with the alcohol bringing up the finish. Feels very crisp and full bodied with some alcohol warming as well. Overall a very enjoyable beverage."
"I remember really liking this when i got into craft beer, it's not bad, but there is nothing to keep my attention, no stars of this show. I guess this is one way of seeing my change of tastes forming."
"Medium body. Fairly dry for a Strong Dark. A nice change. Very nice overall. Alcohol is fairly hidden but does cut the drinkability somewhat. Nevertheless fairly smooth and well balanced."
"Overall: I have to say that I enjoyed the Nocturnum and would probably enjoy it even more after aging it a little bit to reduce the tartness and making it more fruity rather than tart. I admit that this beer really tested my abilities and I think that I'm going to have to come back to this one down the road to get a better idea. *After returning to it and drinking it in a different glass, the review has been updated."
"Overall this was a good Belgian Strong Dark Ale. I liked most everything about this beer, except the aroma, it just seemed off to me and the muskiness did not help that one bit. Other then that everything else was pretty nice, I liked the dominating raisin flavor in this beer it really went nice with the Belgian yeast. I would drink this beer again but for the price I won't be going out of my way to get it. If you like the style give it a try, just try and not let the aroma turn you off. I would like to see what the other two delirium's are like."
"Pours a fantastic thick dark murky brown with wonderful head and great lacing throughout. Great huge malt scents with a wonderful cherry aroma bursting through. Wonderful flavors, with a great thick, rich, and dark maltiness, a wonderful fruitiness (cherry mostly), and a nice hit of spiciness at the end. Goes down thick and smooth, but with quite a bit of alcohol heat to it."
"Picked up a 22oz. at WorldMarket for I believe $9.99, not a bad price for a strong craft beer. Its a very good sipper, very malty and very sticky, very smokey if you can get through all the alcohol. I could probably do this for a fine dinner but thats just me. I can't really say much but find it. Its not a beer to drop what your doing and go hunt for, however if its on a shelf at your local brew store, buy it, its that beer that you ""Just haven't gotten around to trying."" Also look for a couple of their other brews i hear they're just as good or better. Stay thirsty my friends"
"Concluding thoughts: Very enjoyable. I would definitely pick this up again. I look forward to try more of Huyghe's other beers."
"I tend to prefer Nocturnum to Tremens, if only because I find Tremens to be a little too in your face with the yeast, while this is slightly more well-rounded (I might even say cohesive). Like Tremens, it's kind of in it's own category but I still think its a novel spin on the Belgian dark ale. Definitely worth a try for any fan of the style."
"This beer is so full of tastes - fruity and delightful but strong. It gets its message across and the aftertaste leaves you wanting to get more. Easy to drink on its own without food, and much better on draft than in a bottle. A go to beer when you just want something delicious, easy to drink, and not too filling."
"good price and rather tasty, I'll grab one of these from time to time, try it if you get the chance"
"This was a very good beer, awesome flavor and very easy to drink. I would definitely try to get this again."
"Definitely worth coming back to, again .. and again but perhaps only one at a time."
"M & D - dark in color, light feel. Very flavorful but not heavy. Lightly creamy. Smooth."
"Poured a nice dark brown with an average sized creamy head that was mostly lasting and had good lacing. The aroma was heavy of roasted malts, a sweet doughy yeast with notes of molasses , raisons, dark chocolate and coffee. It tasted sweet at first and finished sweet yet mild with hints of raisons, brown sugar and a mild coffee note. Mouthfeel was very creamy in texture an medium in body with a flat carbonation. Overall and awesome tasting brew!!"
"Serving type: bottle"
"The flavor is not quite as sweet as the nose, a net positive. Pretty fruity, with rum raisin and plum. Mouthfeel is medium-light with a solid malt backbone that is leavened quite a bit by the active yeast. Too thin and light to be among the best of style."
"Excellent complexity and dynamic variation in flavor from start to aftertaste."
"Overall, I'd say Delirium Nocturnum is an enjoyable dark strong ale with the characteristic profile one would expect from the style. After writing the first part of this review I sampled some Orange Pim's biscuits with this beer, and the blending of the chocolate with orange marmalade went very well with the overall dark almost earthy taste and texture of the beer with its citrus overtones."
"D: Very drinkable. Quite tasty, with a pleasant mouthfeel and the alcohol very much hidden. A lovely, complex strong dark ale."
"Doesn't stand out as one of the best Belgian strong dark ales out there, but a well made beer that I enjoyed."
"A very drinkable beer. It's on my go to list."
"Poured from 12oz bottle into snifter glass. Color is a dark ruby with good carbonation and a tight off white head. Aroma is a sweet toasted caramel scent. Taste is malty and fizzy. Starting with a medium body it goes down with a very fizzy feel. Finish is malty with a mild fruity yeast flavor and a dried fruit sweetness. After taste is clean and dry with the fruit slowly fading. This is a fabulous brew, mildly complex with good Belgian flavors."
"D: its good but not something i could sit and drink all night...one does the trick...the sweetness gets to me."
"Drinkablity- A great well balanced beer, very likable. great for sipping and enjoying"
"Serving type: Bottle, dated ?/2010."
"Overall: I love this beer. It has a perfect balance (that I was not expecting) and the chocolaty, funky, fruity flavor is a winner with me. I'm glad to be adding this crazy bottle to my list of regulars. The bottle makes it great to introduce to others. Glad I found this! Definitely in my ""TOP 10"" list. I love this beer!!"
"I could drink this for a long while!"
"D - this is one of my go-to brews when out at certain bars and I love knocking back a few."
"Pours a dark brown amberish color with a two finger head and ample lacing. Smells a sweet malt, strawberries, tartness, and solvent alcohol. Taste is of malt, belgium yeast, some tartness and slight hop bitterness. Medium bodied with a moderate drinkability."
"A very good beer. The taste is hurt a bit by a little too much sourness, but a solid beer nonetheless."
"D: Alcohol is noticable but not in a bad way. After a little while gets too sweet for me. Quite good, but still prefer Chimay Blue for the style."
"Very dark, brown, red color. Less head than I expected and the head is pale brown. No lacing on the sides as it goes down. Smells slightly of dark cherries, a pleasant smell. But it tastes flat and uninspired. Very little carbonation. The beer is pretty sweet, a little syrupy, and reminds me a little of cherry cough syrup. Flavor is a mixture of dark fruit and malts. The high alcohol content is very well hidden, and that's the best complement I can give it. I remember enjoying Delirium Tremens and so I thought I'd like this one more. Maybe it was just a bad bottle."
"D - Ok drink. Nothing really spectacular. The amount of alcohol taste took away from the flavor of the beer. Surprised of the smoothness though, but doubt I'll pick up another one."
"Delirium Nocturnum was dark brown in color with some very fine yeast particles floating throughout. It had a large fuffy tan head with good retention, but minimal lacing. The smell was dark malt and fruity. The taste was more dark malt and fruit, and yeast flavors and spices with with some sweetness coming through. It finish was long and semi-dry. It was medium-full in body with medium-high carbonation. The drinkability was good. This is a good Belgian Ale that is worth trying out."
"THis is a nice European dark beer presented in a colorful bottle. The beer itself is a deep, golden amber with a hint of citrus and fruits, with a light hint of wood. The beer poured smoothly into a pint glass with minimal head, a nice fruity aroma, and just the right amount of zing on the tongue for a beer with this high of alcohol content, which is listed at 8.5%."
"I need to get more of this stuff!"
"D: This beer is really drinkable. Really enjoyed this one."
"Flavor is very nice and deep with a smooth finish despite the high ABV. Just a hint of fruit in the mouth."
"D: All-in-all, this is a very good beer that hides the 8.5% alcohol well. The taste is exceptional, but the aroma and mouthfeel are just a little too much for me. Definitely worth checking out, especially if you like sweeter beer and/or grape juice."
"I originally was going to open the bottle for New Years, but I got tired leading up to midnight. I'm very glad to enjoy it tonight, and it won't be the last time I go to the dark side of the pink elephant."
"Poured into a pint glass which had a huge fluffy head with amazing retention. It smells very malty and one can tell that there is a great deal of yeast in this brew. The taste follows the lead of the smells with a big malty flavor that is very yeasty and bread like. This is a thick beverage that upholds the standard let down from other Belgian brewers. There is a reason why this beer is so highly received and I will defiantly seek this one out again."
"I hope I got a bad one."
"A go to BDSA when I'm not looking for something to style."
"It is highly drinkable despite the alcohol. I could definitely drink a few of these in an evening without a problem."
"Drinkabilty - Pretty tasty for a strong ale. Easy enough to drink once you get use to the bitternes, which isnt that overpowering. This is closer to a dubbel then i was expecting. The price and 8.5% makes this a 1 or 2 and enough beer."
"D- This is a very different beer that is enjoyable. The smell is a little off putting, but once you take the first sip it is very easy to get over the smell."
"This brew has a very nice appearance with respectable clarity for a darker brew. It's smell is not very potent, but enjoyable none the less. When it comes to taste, I find this brew to be only slightly less satisfying than its brother, Delirium Tremens; however, it is still plenty delicious. Each drink contains a pleasant mix of fruit notes and malt with a light hint of caramel. At times, the caramel leaves me wanting for little more, but other times it seems just right. Overall, a very enjoyable beer, and highly recommended, but don't forget to try the Tremens as well."
"Definitely a good example of belgian beer."
"Note; cambozola cheese went quite well with this beer."
"I am really not a big fan of Belgian Strong ale's but this one caught me by surprise.Very good."
"D - Drinkability is moderate. It goes down easily enough, but the bland flavor and smell keep it from being something I'd want to drink much of in a night. A big let-down especially considering how much I enjoy Tremens."
"The appearance of this beer is a clear brown, almost like a dark amber color. The head is very fizzy, an dis slightly tan. The aroma smells malty, maybe baking bread. The flavor is sweet, and has a warm feeling to it. The warmth could be from the alcohol but may also be a characteristic of a malt. I havent been able to find the ingredients list for this beer. Mouthfeel is medium, not light like a trippel but not heavy like a brown ale. Its actually a pretty drinkable beer! Reminds me of if you were to mix a dubbel with out all the candi sugar with a brown ale."
"Much better in the bottle."
"The drinkability is good. Overall it's a solid beer, no real negative aspects for me. It's definitely a beer I'll be buying again. And with it's awesome bottle, I may buy it as a stocking stuffer."
"Overall I enjoyed this beer. Definately worth trying."
"D: ABV is well hidden. A solid brew with good drinkability. Perhaps a good intro to this style, however there are numerous better belgian strong dark ales out there."
"It's drier than it smells. The cherries continue and there are some caramel malts bringing other dark fruits as well. The alcohol dries it all out in a wine-like mini-burn giving off some astringency. It finishes very dry on the tongue. This is not at all refreshing and leaves wanting to drink something else to slake your thirst."
"It's not bad, but it doesn't ""wow"" me at all. Taste is somewhat lower for this reason. However, it is a very drinkable brew...goes down very easily."
"This one will definitely warm your head after a little while, as expected of course. Not my favorite, but overall a good beer."
"Good drinkability as this is a smooth easy flowing beer that is tart and tasty in a good way. This was an enjoyable beer, but not one I could drink all night; another one a done type of beer."
"A bit thin and fizzy for the style, but also very drinkable for it's ABV. Almost like it was made to drink more than sip or eat with."
"I enjoyed drinking this beer, but I'm not convinced; in other words, I enjoy the effort, but the fruit was not ripe for the picking. Warmed up to the recommended temperature it still wasn't bringing that boldness that I have come to expect and appreciate."
"This would make a great dessert beer. It is mildly sweet and medium thick. The initial smell reminds me of caramel apples. Nocturnum is very complex and does a good job of hiding the higher alcohol content."
"D - Very good and pleasant beer. Makes a great winter ale."
"The pour of this beer was a very excitable frothy head that settled down with time to a nice medium layer with medium lacing. A dark brown/red beer with a caramel colored head. The nose is nothing special until it warms up and has a rosy malt smell with hints of cherry and molasses. The taste is wonderfully smooth and hides the alcohol expertly until the last few sips. The overall mouthfeel is very pleasant and this is a beer that you can find yourself drinking too much of with good company. Overall a very enjoyable beer that mirrors it's worldwide commercial popularity."
"D - A wonderful medley of flavors and textures make this a wonderful beer to drink, I'd put it on your list of things to do."
"D: I could not have more than one glass of this since it's so sweet. Too much for me."
"D: Very easy and pleasing to drink! One of my favorite beers. Although, I will say, it is a fairly dense drink... I usually can't drink more than a couple in one sitting."
"For as strong as the beer is, there is only a bit of warmth in the swallow from the alcohol. It's medium-bodied and keeps your taste buds on their toes with lots of different feelings. When all is said and done, it tastes good and is easy to drink."
"jd"
"D: This is about as classic as you could get for the style, The ABV does not even hold its own in the taste, while I could drink these all night, I will hold off to promote to other friends. Great brew!"
"D= This is a great sipping beer for cool fall evenings.It's complex flavor profiles,interests but not overpowers the tastebuds.I would buy this all fall and winter if I could afford it.A great well balanced beer."
"MF/D: an initial smoothness gives way to a dry heat finish as the flavors dissipate. a boozy heat lingers for an extended period of time."
"D- Not bad beer for sure; the carbonation was just a little low for me, but still has a nice taste."
"The mouthfeel is what I would expect from the amount of carbonation in this brew, it's got a lighter more bubbly champagne-like feel which balances well with all the thicker malt to create an extremely drinkable brew. I like it a lot, I think it would go amazingly with a pie or tart during dessert, something with fruit in it."
"D: Goes down easy, but the alcohol presence keeps you from going too fast (which is probably a good thing)."
"D: Like I said, I could drink this constantly. Not everyone will like this one, but I definitely do."
"D - An enjoyable beer but not one that I would run out to buy again."
"D: A darn good beer, not as good as Noel for me, but a very solid BSDA. Something you'll not be unhappy picking up."
"Great beer that I would drink anytime I needed a Belgian fix."
"M/D: The feel is slightly carbonated and on the thinner side. It compliments the beer nicely. This is one of the easier drinking Belgiun Dark Ales I've had, but that may be more because those others were stronger and more robust. A nice beer, but it doesn't wow me."
"Drinkability: This beer is tasty and a nice sipper. However, I do wish that the metallic flavor wasn't in this beer's finish, because that is the only real negative and that is, in my opinion, a pretty significant negative. I want to have this again- and I hope the metallic flavor isn't in all of the bottles of this brew."
"D - Great winter warmer or even dessert beer."
"The carbonation of the beer makes drinking this very similar to a pop (F you if you say soda) which not many beers can boast. This beer is a little pricey which detracts from the drinkability but alas it's worth the price tag. This beer would have been the highlight of the evening if it wasn't for the extra boost it gave me in my inebriation that allowed me to talk to the girl I plan on calling tomorrow. This beer is an experience, in my experience it led to a great evening (I had more before) but there's no way in the world I could tell someone not to drink this beer. I've drank it before and goddamnit I'll drink it again. I've had more beers than my reviews proclaim and I've never had anything like a Delirium Nocturnum."
"Poured a very dark, thin & tan laced-headed brownish black. Lots of protein particles suspended toward the end. Smell is sweet, dark fruits, and rich malts. Taste starts of roasted and smooth, but runs into a bitter wall that leads me to believe that severe alcohol burn awaits.. but it doesn't. Very complex. Finishes bitter and smooth(er). Drinkability is a bit low, as this brew leans a little on the rich side. Decent, but not mind-blowing."
"Tastes quite a bit different from the smell actually. Dark fruits have a nice effect, blueberries and chocolate covered bananas. The malt is nice as well with some decent roast going on. Bready yeast seems to be the signature profile of the beer as it seems to pervade every sip I take. Has a grabbing grass bitterness on the finish and everything seems to compliment each other well here. I like the brew more than I remember back in the day. Mouthfeel is thin for the style but does not seem to detract much from the overall experience. Good, solid beer that I would be happy to revisit again soon."
"D- for 8.5% ABV it's insanely drinkable. Drinks like a cider, not at all like a strong ale. If I wasn't paying $10.99 for a 750ml bottle this brew could kill me."
"Taste quite complex spreads, almost like a liqueur, tastes bitter and roasted coated with a yeast and malt with a fruity interesting. This fruit speaks through attendance sweet and syrupy halfway between red fruit juices and super concentrated syrup of Liège. The finish offers a bitterness also very interesting for its blend of malt and roasted malt presence."
"330 mL bottle. Really nice coppery brown colour, clear, except that giant chunks of sediment starting coming out of the bottle about 2/3 of the way through a slow, gentle pour. This really detracted from the look of the beer. The bottle had been stationary in my fridge for ~3 months, so I was a bit disappointed about this. Short beige cap, rocky collar, with a bit of lacing. Nice aroma. Alcohol soaked dried fruits, plums, cinnamon, sugary sweet, hint of dark malts and bread. Very sweet, sugary and malty with a lot of fruit character. Lots of plum and raisin character, moderate alcohol flavour and warmth towards the end. Toffee sweetness, bready malts, nice flavour overall. Medium bodied with ample carbonation, nice texture... except for the feel of big hunks of sediment entering my mouth. Not cool. This is a solid beer, but the poor sedimentation is a real problem for me. I can easily overlook a little bit of sediment at the bottom of a bottle, in fact, I expect it for certain styles, but this was ridiculous. I would have blamed it on myself had I not stored this beer for quite a while at low temps and poured it very carefully due to the opaque bottle."
"Overall a solid beer. A solid beer and a must for those looking to initiate themselves in the world of fine brewing."
"Drinkability is shamefully high. All that waiting, and I'm fighting myself to not gulp it down. One of the best BSDA's I've ever had, phenomenal."
"Pours a deep, clear mahogany with a large, fizzy, tan head that recedes quickly with little lacing. Smell is sour fruits and alcohol. Taste is again dominated by sour fruits with a nice malty, caramel backbone and some alcohol in the finish. A bit lighter than I would have thought but good nonetheless. Good beer, glad I picked this up, would definitely drink again."
"D: I must say, I wouldn't drink this very often, but I prefer it to its more famous counterpart, Delirium Tremens. One of the least beery beers I've reviewed."
"d- really nice here, this is the best belgian that i've had in awhile, i would drink this again."
"M & D - Very full and complex body. Good beer but not the best BSDA. High ABV."
"Drinkability- Simply put, delicious. Delirium Nocturnum hides its alcohol under a complex array of flavors the build to a captivating crescendo on the tongue and leave a pleasant warmness in the throat and belly. Given the choice between the two, I would take Delirium Nocturnum for a session."
"D - Pretty drinkable due to the smoothness and stealthy 8 ABV but not as enjoyable as most premium Belgian dark styles due to its tangy nature as well as minimal dark fruity presence (4)"
"330 ml mock ""stoneware"" glass bottle, courtesy of Cardinal Pub & Bar, Stavanger. ABV is 8.5%. Chestnut coloured beer with a big and lasting tan head. Lovely aroma of various fruits and spices, hints of farmhouse kitchen and red wine vinegar. The flavour is malty with moderate notes of dried fruits and spices. Nice one."
"D- A rich complex style and this is an excellent example. Dangerously smooth."
"D: The beer is very easy to drink."
"D - This was a little disappointing. As it warms the spices and grain gain a little more complexity, but the malt background I was expecting never showed up. Overall it seemed out of balance without the malt."
"D- Nice on a cool winter's day as it's quite warming... a little ""slowing"" on the hot summer day I had it on however"
"(11.2 oz bottle) Poured a light hazy gold with modest carbonation. Virtually no lacing. Very mild floral flavor with nice hop and malt balance. No taste of the alcohol. A very pleasant finish. One of the more mild Belgian beers I've had. This would have broad appeal. I would look for again to purchase or recommend."
"D: It's a quality beer so it is definitely drinkable. Not my preferred style, but I wouldnt mind drinking another."
"Drank out of a wiskey glass at bar; rant not included because of cultural apretiation. And thick head regardless of glass. although thined out to little lase. Taste was great; that may be all that need to be said but if not maore this may be ended on internet. The taste was rich and very belgium esc. complex. Not nessesarally yeasty but very much so malty and quazi yeast and great."
"S - the smell was j"
"The mouth moves from sweet to dry rather quickly. It would have benefitted from a hint of sourness, but it still manages to be an original effort that will be worth a spin every once in a while."
"This may be an old bottle. I got it at ABC in their clearance section. I still think the foil is just shit icing on the annoying cake."
"Taste is very nice, sweet and malty. Very full mouthfeel and a light caramel finish. No idea that its so boozy by the taste, very good beer."
"D: Very good BSD. But with the price tag it's a little tough buying this one over and over. Solid beer, but there are better ones out there."
"I'll be honest and say this is a good, but not exceptional dark ale. It belongs in the main group of excellent ales that gives body to Belgium as a beer nation."
"D: Really enjoyable brew, if it weren't for the 8.5% I could drink these all night and be happy. Tastes great and has a good feel too, but the alcohol hits a bit too hard to have several unless with a big meal. I loved this beer, and will gladly buy more. A good start to my tour of Belgian beers."
"D: A light and refreshing beer despite its dark appearance. Mouth is very dry and goes well with tart fruity flavors. This one is not as good as Delirium Tremens, but then again DT is one of my favorite beers. Still, not bad, and I would probably buy this again."
"D-excellent dark Belgian Ale, could drink it again and again"
"This one goes down smooth and easy, but not as flavorful as other examples of this style I have tried. My standard for this style is LeTerrible by Unibroue, and this one is lacking the fullness and complexity of that. Not a bad beer, but I do prefer Delirium Tremens over the Nocturnum."
"D: Very drinkable despite what I think is a little too much carbonation for this beer. Not in a bad way, but with the flavors this beer has, it's a little too much I think. I'll definitely be finishing the 750ml bottle though."
"are equal parts bubble gum and candy yeast with a sour cherry note. Very sour, like picked off the tree and plopped into mouth kind of sour. Mouthfeel is pretty light but the carbonation is fitting. This was a good beer, all around."
"Huyghe has a fine beer here, but as is typical of their offerings, the sediment holds it back, and more so since I want to sip and savor this one. I must say having a floater come to rest on ones lips is a definite turn off."
"This was my gateway beer into belgians about 5 years ago, so it holds a special place for me."
"D- A strong and rich beer. I enjoyed this, and it was nice to see it at a near by bar, but I dont think I will be having it again."
"Overall, this is a very good belgian strong dark, and a unique one as well. I definitely enjoyed this one, and really wanna try delirium tremens as well."
"At times I feel like this beer is over carbonated, I have to let it sit to dull down a sharp texture. I couldn't do more than the 750ml."
"I found this to be a nice beer to sip and savor. It's probably not one I'd have on a regular basis, but for a once in a while nightcap it serves it's purpose well."
"A dark reddish brown pour with with a chunky two finger lasting head , spotty lacing left , lively carbonation , lots of yeast chunks yum . Aroma is of burnt caramel , brown sugar , rasins, dates and grass. Flavor is lightly sweet at the start with some yeasty fruit type esters, leather, rasins light dark chocolate , grass,some tangy wheat and banana with a hint of alcohol at the tail end , full body with a smooth creamy mouthfeel ,light bitterness, short wheaty like finish . Drinkable and a fun try but no where near worth the price of admission ."
"For a Belgian strong dark ale this beer works very well and its drink ability is top notch."
"Overall, this is a tasty Belgian. Nothing to write home about, but it does fit the style pretty well. The beer touches on all the aspects I like to see in a dark Belgian ale, but falls a little short in excelling in each of them. However, if you haven't tried Nocturnum its worth picking up a bottle. Still an enjoyable drink."
"Delirium Nocturnum pours very dark with thick creamy head that lingers throughout while you drink. You can definetly see some sediment in this beer, even with the darkness of the beer. Smells a bit sweet to me. Taste is also a bit sweet at first, but a slight bitterness and burn with the aftertaste. You can definetly taste the alcohol in this beer. I recommend this beer, I haven't really had anything like it before."
"Like a semi-sweet dessert and nightcap, all rolled into one tidy little pink-elephant-toned package. Not quite up to the spec of the better offerings of its Belgian compatriots, but agreeable enough on its own, once you get past the bottle effervescence. Entry-level BSDA, I suppose."
"Taste and smell of this beer were OK. I was maybe disappointed that the aroma wasn't more than what I was expecting. Taste was simply so-so. Had a lot of raisin/date flavor with maybe a little clove which kind of left me with a wine-y type perception. Had one glass of this and then moved onto something else. Overall, I'm not a big fan of this particular style, so I'm not questioning the brewer's talent in crafting this beer, however this just didn't wow me. I really wanted to like this one too."
"Dark ruby red and rich brown when held to the light. Dense tan head. Smells of dark cherry and raisins and plums and maybe burnt chocolate. A little alcohol smell as well. Well carbonated with some alcohol warmth. Kind of sweet and tart cherry flavor with a sour aftertaste. There's kind of a cough syrup element to this beer... Kind of Robitussinesque. Bittersweet burps. A touch syrupy. I guess I was expecting a beer more like Delirum Tremens or La Fin Du Monde. I like those styles better than this one."
"overall: pretty good. its good to try new beers and im glad i bought it. saying that not a huge fan of the taste and it was pretty expensive 9$ for one pint. on a side note i really liked the bottle it is one of the coolest designs i have seen and thats why it caught my eye at first."
"Drinkability: A good beer that is slightly complex for the style. This tastes similar but not exactly like sangria. A sipper, I will want this again."
"D - good solid beer. I'm ambivalent about the overall construction (& maybe the style it's going for) -- aside from where I've noted above, the overall character is pretty monotone. Alky is not especially well hidden, especially compared to what American counterparts are doing with stronger variations on Belgian themes."
"D: Not as smooth as I had hoped for, but a nice beer nonetheless."
"Wow, this does not tread lightly. Pours a dark brown and provided about 1 inch of light brown foaming head that quickly dissipated. What a sweet malty fruity smell. Can taste fruits and the alcohol. Almost tastes stronger than the advertised 8.5% ABV. Surprisingly light and effervescent for a strong ale. As far as drink-ability goes, I imagine I could down a couple on an occasion but wouldn't recommend more than three at a sitting. A nice treat before heading off for a brief beer hiatus. Cheers."
"Taste was quite enjoyable, full bodied with strong brown sugar and caramel with a deep malty character. Light spiciness that lingers in a very subtle, but enjoyable bitterness. Warms on the way down with a bit of alcohol that carries through. The smoothness makes this quite drinkable."
"Overall Impression: Very complex strong belgian ale, the alcohol is well hidden by the complex flavors and it a very warming beer to drink."
"Notes: Good mix of different flavors, but they fall mostly under similar flavors. A lot of what you would experience with the style, and definitely a Belgian. Good warming and slight sweetness."
"D - This is nice stuff, but I generally will take other Belgian options (Chimay, St. Bernardus, etc.) over it. And in most places where they have Delirium, they have one of the aforementioned beers. But I will definitely take this over a Belgian from Quebec."
"This feels like it's bursting with CO2, kind of chewy, and a notable alcohol warmth."
"D: For how much shit this beer had floating in it, this beer is damn tasty. It has everything a beer of this style has to offer. Definitely worth trying."
"Delirium does it well. Pink elephants are always a good time."
"T- Meh. Bready is the word. Hiding very well its ABV, this beverage is also NOT the sugary one I expected. Yeasty. The more it warms up, the better it is. Delirium Nocturnum is a type of beer that should be opened at cellared temp and enjoyed slowly until it gets warm. Not awesome, but of interest."
"Pours as a very dark ruby red with a small creamy off-white head that is patch in places and lots of fine carbonation. The aroma had lots of strong dark fruits, black currents, and red winey grapes, which is partnered with a clear smell of alcohol. The taste is very fruity like the aroma, lots of dark sugary fruit, figs, grapes, blackberries. There is a hint of a malty support but the flavours are dominated by an almost acidic black current fruitiness. The mouthfeel is oily, and very carbonic. A bit too sweet for my liking. If you like big dark Belgian ales with tons of dark fruit character, you will love this."
"D: High. Despite the high ABV, you cannot feel too much the alcohol. Lovely Belgian beer. Recommended."
"Notes: Overall a solid Belgian beer with a ton of complexity and character. I need to drink a few more of these to pin down the flavors. I'll keep you posted with updates."
"What it lacks in its complexity it makes up for in its price-tag....wish it was the other way around."
"Overall, this is a good, solid beer BUT the competiton in this style of beer is tight. St. Bernardus Abt 12, Ommegang, and Chimay blue will be considerations before the Delerium Noctournum. This is a good ale but, once again, the tight competition in this style will keep this one from seeing the light of day and my patronage."
"Fours strait across the board. I tip my hat to the brewer. The beer reveals many different tastes, very distinct from on another, but all fruit based. Personally, it's a little overwhelming and too fruit dominate for my palate, but you have to respect the craftsmanship that went into this product. To appreciate it, be warned that a simple swig reveals nothing; you're required to let the beer camp out on the palate for a least a few ticks before enjoying more."
"Drinkability: This is another great beer taken down a notch by the mouthfeel. Should you search this beer out? Yes, but only just."
"Starts out with an amber pour, leaving a scent of bread and applejacks - both in the bottle and in the glass. A full-bodied yet smooth, almost fruit-laced taste, followed by an inviting aftertaste reminiscent of apples, biscuits...and cheese. A quaffable beverage for sure, and a bit more interesting than your regular, run-of-the-brew beer. A Belgian beer definitely worth trying."
"D-Like many belgians its very refreshing even in spite of its high abv but really isn't much of a standout but can easily be drunk all night"
"drinkability is good - the last few years mellowed this beer out so much- however i do prefer to taste some booze in the a strong dark"
"A great Belgian strong, dark ale for when things get a bit tedious. Less traditional then Chimay Grande Reserve or others of the style. A really complex and funky ale, I almost prefer this over the more traditional ones its always a surprise. I mean sour apple in a dark ale, sign me up. I think Chimay is a better example of the style, but I'm sure going to have to wrestle with my indecision next time I want a 750ml of A Belgian Dark Strong Ale"
"It pours a big creamy tan head, with great lacing. Dark brown with red hues. It has a very sour smell, lots of alcohol. The taste is similar, lots of sour apple. I don't find it to be as complex as most other BSDAs. The mouth feel is also a bit on the thinner side. I just think this a very average BSDA, I wouldn't really go out of my way to get it again."
"D: This beer is easy to drink, but considering its disappointing flavor, I didn't exactly want to keep coming back to it. Rather unfortunate considering how much I enjoy Tremens."
"CHEERS!!"
"D- Very nice on a very cold winter night."
"Overalll: It's not a bad beer, it's just a little dull on the palate. I usually prefer this style over that of Tremens, but I like Tremens much more."
"D - Fairly crisp and interesting, but perhaps a little overpowering for routine drinking."
"M&D: carbonation goes smooth and mild, matching the medium body just well. I can't sense incredibly delicious elements or extraordinary complexity in this glass, maybe due to the relatively mild estery flavour as far as this beer style is concerned, but the overall performance is elevated by the lightly dry aftertaste in particular, making it an easy drinking and thirst-quenching type of dark ale. A well-made one all in all."
"At the Cloverleaf Tavern, Caldwell, NJ: poured a dark mahogany into a tulip, with two fingers of beige-colored head. The smell yielded some sweet fruitiness, tartness, spice, and caramel, but was a little dominated by the latter. The flavor however, seemed perfectly balanced; caramel apple, cranberry, brown sugar, sour cherry, malt, and possibly some candi sugar as well, punctuated with a tart lambic-like finish. When combined with the full-bodied mouthfeel, the sensory experience was delightful. I loved this beer, but it might be a little too strong to knock back one after the other."
"D - It's a drinkable beer, but not one that could be enjoyed everyday."
"D- great beer from an intriguing brewery, almost on par with the tremens. deep and bold flavor keep me sippin away, while strength and heft discourage crackin another bottle. beer this good should be handled one at a time. on to the lighter stuff."
"D - For a 8.5% beer, this stuff goes down easily. Having two would not be a problem. A nice strong ale."
"taste is tart, sour malt, berry, plum, red grape, caramel, and nuts, ends tart and a tad bitter."
"Mouthfeel is full bodied and refreshing with no aftertaste or coating left sehr gut"
"J"
"this beer is carbonated like a wild ale, though it doesn't have half of the appeal that that style boasts, and thus it can rightly be said that it is ""over-carbonated"" in a major way. the airiness of the mouthfeel does nothing to compliment the beers merits (if there indeed are any). the drinkability is okay because it is drink-ABLE (i.e., not a drain pour, by any means), but i wouldn't want another."
"A bit pricey, but definitely worth trying."
"Mouthfeel is thick and creamy, very full."
" The taste is compared to almost exactly how it smells. Very sweet and complex with all sorts of stuff going on. Heavy brew not for beginners. I would drink this again if available, but would not seek it out."
"Note - Arguably one of the best bottles in all of beerdom... A beige ceramic bottle contrast nicely with the blue label which displays a youthful elephant, wonderful colors, and a unique font..."
"The 8.5%abv is nowhere to be found, but I'm sure that it's nothing to mess with either. Easy drinking, but be careful."
"Drinkability: Its got such a high ABV that you wouldn't want more than about 22oz of this in a night."
"Drinkability: quite good. While there is a little alcohol bite, it's not enough to really clue the drinker in to its 8.5% heft. This could almost be a session beer due to its smoothness."
"Verdict: A thoroughly enjoyable experience through and through, Delirium Nocturnum is a terrific example of the Belgian Strong Dark Ale style. Watch out for the hidden alcohol content tough, it can have you seeing pink elephants in no time flat."
"Drinkability - i will and have had many more certainly goes down as one of my favorites careful though can catch up to you quickly!"
"Drinkability: My first Belgian Strong Dark Ale, but a good one. Strong taste of dark fruit and grape, with a fermented red wine character. Boozy on the first taste, but more hidden afterwards. Definitely a sipper."
"Poured a murky brown with a modest head that quickly reduced to a collar. The aroma was over ripe fruit and a little boozy. The taste was ripe pears but wasn't overwhelmed by excess carbonation that I often find in BSDA's. Sweet with a sour backup. The feel was medium bodied with sufficient carbonation to do the job. Drinkability was good. I liked Nocturnum because it wasn't so carbonated that the tongue could not sense anything else."
"An overall yum. Not as powerful as what I imagine Belgian Strong Darks to taste like, but enjoyable nevertheless."
"Overall, best fresh on tap. This one has not held up well over time. May have to re-write a new review when this year's batch comes in."
"The beer pours up a dark mahogany, with a head that dissipates quickly. The aroma reminds me of holiday fruitcake and piquant raisins. The taste is dry plums and dark roasted malt. Not at all soft, which is not in any way distasteful. I enjoyed this beer at room temperature. Good carbonation lends an almost ""sweet grape"" characteristic to the beer. It has maybe a little of that dried dark sugar taste of prunes to it, but not in an unpleasant sense. The aroma and taste are intense, and truly befitting the name. The silky mouthfeel adds a merlot characteristic, making it highly drinkable. Please do yourself a favor, and pick up a 750 mL bottle for a dinner. I promise, it will impress."
"Drinkability: This is good stuff. Kinda different. I just can't get enough of a dark belgian. The flavor just doesnt seem as refined to me, though. On looks and mouthfeel, its about perfect. I'd be lying if I said I didnt enjoy every sip."
"Unfortunately, for its complexity of taste, Nocturnum is a difficult beer to put down a lot of. As others have claimed, Nocturnum is better shared and sipped."
"i poured this dark belgian ale cool into a room temp pint glass. had about a finger thick tan head that retained well and sat above a ruddy brown ale which was a brilliant ruby hue when held to light. had nice bits of yeast floating around inside, dodging tiny bubbles that come up from the bottom. looks fantastic. smells are not subtle in any way. a small spectrum of spice, alcohol, chocolaty malts and the distinguishable belgian yeast smell are present. tastes amazing. very nicely balanced, has that nice spicy sweet characteristic of belgian darks, but it isnt overwhelmingly powerful, with more sweet than spice. warming alcohol at the end is preceded by ripe fruit flavors, its a little tart, to me like a cherry or apple tartness, figs, with a carmel like sweetness beneath.. mouthfeel is smooth, if not silky. nicely carbonated, not too much so for this style, and it doesn't hinder its drinkability. the alcohol would keep me from drinking too many at once but its a very enjoyable beer."
"This is a very nice brew and well worth going back for."
"Medium bodied with a smooth mouthfeel. Finish is a little dry. The alcohol was well hidden for the most part and the flavors blended together nicely, making this one enjoyable to sip on. I still got the feeling every now and then that maybe this was just a little too sweet for the style but not enough to bother me so this is still a good call in my book."
"Overall a good beer that will be going into my collection."
"- Drinkable yes.. bit of heartburn... flavor is good... overall a nice Belgian."
"Notes: good beer, I would definitely have it again, but for the style, I prefer trios pistoles or chimay bleu"
"The beer poured a reddish brown with a big tan head. The smell is mostly candy-sweet malt with some molasses characteristic. The taste starts off with some sweetness that gives way to a bit of tartness in the finish with the alcohol coming through at the end. The mouthfeel was thick with a moderate amount of carbonation and some pleasant warming in the palate. This is a pretty drinkable beer with some definite character to it."
"D- One 750 will put all but the heavyweights down for the count. Best shared with two people. Great, great beer, though. Save this for a special occasion, although at $7 a 750ml, you have a great deal on your hands; the price is comparable to a lot of 6-packs."
"Tastes of chocolate and berries with a nice easy finish. I could drink more of this than your normal heavey beer. I actually like this better than the tremens."
"Pours Dark Brown with a light tan head, good lacing throughout the whole glass and a head that retains throughout the experience. Smells like fruits, malts and sort of metallic/alcohol. Tastes of sweet fruits, malts, cant really get much flavor because of high carbonation. Mouthfeel is pretty full and creamy and coats the palette. Will probably not drink again because of metallics/carbonation/not taking much flavor away. Had better belgians."
"A good beer and in my opinion a lot more mature and complex than the standard Delirium Tremens offering."
"An easy sipper that you can take deep into the night. A standout BSDA."
"The foam was wheat in color, bubbly and stuck around 4 a while, and smooth. The color was deep amber red/mahogany with a faint brick red highlights. The smell was rich aromatic molassis overtone with some burnt wood and carmel undertones with spicey fruit highlights witha big barley smell. The taste was a rich and complex like a barley wine, a spicey molassis overtone with hints of wheat and hops, not too bitter. Mouthfeel - full-bodied, nice texture. Drinkability - great for slow sippin' to enjoy the complex tastes and aromas."
"Drinkability - Very drinkable for a higher ABV brew. Not sure I'd do a session with this one, especially in the summer. But a very nice hearty fall or winter brew."
"Drinkability- Excellent! will be drinking this again"
"Looking forward to having it again."
"Good brew, this is one of my favorite styles, and this is a delicious sampling. Great flavor complexities, and easy to drink. Very appealing overall."
"Mouthfeel: Medium bodied with a soft carbonation"
"D - Definately a sipper, but very delicious."
"D - Definately a good beer. I don't think I'd drink 2 in a row though."
"D: All and all this is a quality brew. Not my favorite interpretation of the style, but still enjoyable."
"I find this beer delicious, but less drinkable than some others of this style."
"D: not bad, i've had weaker beers that were way stronger"
"OVERALL: One of the better strong dark ales out there. A nice taste profile and a terrific nose on this one. A more impressive look and a slightly creamier palate would put this at or near the top, but non-the-less, this one is definitely worth seeking out. Recommended."
"Drinkability - Good. If you enjoy Tremens, try Nocturnum. It's a good example of the Strong Ale style."
"drinkability - A sipping beer for me, not because the ABV is high, but its sweet."
"D= great very solid brew ill seek it out again."
"Drinkability - Not amazingly so."
"Conclusion: Overall not a bad brew at all; it does seem a bit average for the style however, and I can think of several others I might choose over this if given the choice. I'm still in the minority in the fact that my favorite Delirium brew is their Christmas offering."
"D-who has the recipe. This stuff is good for any occasion, with a meal or alone it would be a tough one to turn down."
"D - Obviously the style isn't supposed to be consumed in rapid succession. Still, Nocturnum drinks very easily."
"This is a solid, if not spectacular, take on the style that's very drinkable for the ABV."
"D - Good but not great in the drinkability department, it has a nice flavor and an outstanding aroma."
"This dark Belgian ale pours a dark mocha color looking almost cola-like. The aroma is very sweet, and the head is not substantial and only makes a brief stay leaving little to no lacing behind. The carbonation seemed to higher than other variations in this style, but that's not a complaint, it was a nice detraction from the usual. The ale has a pronounced chocolate-cherry aftertaste and leaves the palate dry. The body is thinner than it looks, not watery, but thin. This sweet Belgian ale was great for a warm spring evening and was very easy to drink. With an ABV of 8.5% you so have to be a little conscious not to let your sippin' move too fast, otherwise it makes standing up a challenge. Great beer and a great compliment to the pound cake my wife served with it."
"Too much carbonation!"
"Drinkability: Very drinkable and tasty brew, but don't see myself having too many of these due to the alcohol content."
"D- easy at first but gets slightly harder to drink alot."
"D - it isn't bad, but honestly if I wanted a bottle of wine, or of port, I think I would buy one of those instead. This falls of the mark, for me, so I'm not sure if I would drink it again. It is fairly good in its own way, though."
"I'm not ashamed to admit that I have very little experience with Belgian ales, and I've honestly have had some traumatizing experiences with Dubbels and Tripels. I wrongly assumed that these two styles were representative of Belgian ales as a whole, so I had very low expectations for this brew. However, I'm pleased to say that this beer has been kind of an eye-opening experience to me. I feel like I just got schooled by this beer, and that's a very good feeling. I am excited to learn more about Belgians now. I still would like to learn to appreciate Dubbels and Tripels, but that lesson is for another brew."
"My only complaint is that I expected a heavier mouthfeel. This is a nice beer that I will revisit occasionally."
"Overall it doesnt appeal to my particular taste, but this beer isn't half bad. I'd probably give it one more chance before casting it aside for something else. So until that second chance.... cheers!"
"Rich tasting and well balanced. Not overly sweet, or boozy. Thin in body, with a slight sour taste just before the finish. Hints of astringency seem to give this beer the it's penultimate sensation of sour."
"Thick head atop a dark chestnut body. Belgian lace clings to the Delirium glass. Aroma faint notes of black cherry, biscuit malt, and herb-laced yeast. Flavor is mostly malt with a slight medicinal bitterness. Mouthfeel is good, drinkability also good."
"I couldn't drink too many of these, it is nice to get it in the smaller bottles instead of the bigger ones, so ensure no waste of good brew."
"Overall, a little let down here. Guy at Total Wine sold it to me as his favorite beer. Maybe I got a bad bottle. I will wait a while and maybe give it a second opinion."
"D: at $10/bottle, I don't see myself making this a mainstay in my fridge, but perfect to celebrate a special occasion."
"I should note that I was reviewing this beer as I ate dinner, so this probably changed my score on the taste, smell, and mouthfeel. Oh well, I really enjoyed it."
"poured from a belgian style 750ml corked bottle into my chalace/wine glass. pours a dark amber, brownish color with some brownish rubiness when held up to the light. little bit of an off white head that faded to a ring pretty quickly, but can easily be revived with a quick swirl of the glass. just a little bit of lacing. the second glass i poured, unlike the first was filled with tons of sediment, niether a pro nor a con for me. also, the 2nd glass, the head had much better retention. the smell is hugely complex, lots of dark fruits, plum, dates, prunes, raisons, etc. has a little bit of some roasty chocolate malts, a little bit of a musty smell, maybe from the alcohol. some phenolics from the yeast, but not as much as expected for a usual belgian. the taste is amazing, now i can see why this was voted one of the best beers in the world. at first your hit with the dark fruity taste, followed by a nice taste of apples, finishes with a sour dark fruity taste that leaves you longing for more. finishes a tad dry as well. the fruity sourness, prolly from the candied sugar really makes this for me, delicious. the mouthfeel was medium to light bodied, with some high carbonation off the intial pour, but settles to some low carbonation after awhile. quite drinkable beer, does not taste like it has as much alcohol as it does. however, it definately creeps up on you after you finish. i would definately recommend this to anyone that enjoys good beer. hugely complex beer."
"It's still a high percentage ale, so keep an eye on your mates and get them to keep an eye on you, but I could drink this virtually all night... albeit consequentially a short night."
"D - A nice balance of sweet, sour, and bitter come together for great drinkability, but personally this isn't a type of beer I can consume much of. Honestly, the over the top carbonation is a lot of what turns me off and keeps me from putting lots of this stuff down. Wonderful taste, but a little boozy and way too prickly for me."
"Wow, surprisingly smooth and balanced. The finish is very dry, carbonation is moderate-high, virtually no bitterness, full bodied..."
"easy to drink, but a bit spendy for an 11.2 oz bottle"
"d - Very solid. This bomber will be savored tonight. I'll have to thank the buddy that recommended this to me. Tasty with an excellent ABV masking."
"If you've never had a Trappist ale from Belgium and aren't able to find a decent one in your area, you may want to at least pick up some of this. Delirium Nocturnum is a pretty good example of what a dark Belgian beer can taste like. This isn't officially classified as a Dubbel, but it's very similar, as it is a strong ale (8.5%) and it's a dark ale. Well rounded flavor, strong alcohol, and overall a nice beer to relax with or to enjoy on a special occasion. Just don't drink it too cold or at room temperature. Belgians like this do best at cellar temperature and in a goblet-shaped glass. Trust me - try it yourself."
"Pours dark, dark brown with a thick non-receding tan head. Heavy lacing covers the glass like Sherwin-Williams. Smells of Belgium malts, dark fruits, alcohol and Belgium yeast make up the nose. First sip is velvet smooth that is all malt goodness. Sweet than bitter, complex and far from complicated, the beer is solid and is rapidly becoming a good friend. The mouthfeel is so amazing you would think it was brewed by Dairy Queen."
"I wouldn't probably grab this again, I would probably just grab DT."
"Mouthfeel/drinkability: It has a light body with a bit of a dry finish. Carbonation is more noticeable in the glass than in the mouth."
"Poured into a pint glass. This beer pours with a large head and chocolate-tan colored head. It's a clear dark mahogany; the downside in the appearance is the very visible chunks of yeast in this beer. The smell is a bit light, but dark fruits and roasted malts. A little bit of alcohol hits the nose too. The taste isn't overwhelming like many of the Delirium beers, but that's a good thing. Initially, it's a relatively complex mix of dark fruits (plums and cherry) and caramel. As this mellows down the bitterness and spices really shine through with a slightly metallic aftertaste. This beer is a bit thin, but it makes it easier to drink. The initial bad aftertaste dissipates as this beer warms, making it better."
"Overall, I am rather dissapointed, I expected something better for the price. The bottle is nice tough."
"Served on draft in a Delirium glass in Brussels Belgium. Similar to the Delirium Tremens, the Nocturnum is on the darker side of life. One of the smoothest Beligian ales. By far one of my favorite beers from Belgium. About 8.5 to 9% alcohol. This is a beer you never want to put down, in fact I challenge anyone to drink this beer over the period of 15 minutes. It will be gone."
"I finsihed the 750ml bottle last night, so I'd say this is drinkable. I could have had more. This is a great beer."
"Drinkability is good if I made a lot more money...$5 for an 11 oz. bottle makes it hard to make this a session brew. I did enjoy this immensely though. I think I'm gonna try a Tremens tomorrow to see how it compares."
"Poured into a goblet with dark brown/reddish-brown body with a mountainous tan head that dies ever so slowly and leaves lace patches anywhere it wants. Dark fruits, figs, orange and other citric notes, caramel and other sweet malts (maple syrup?) plus a the typical Belgian yeast strain in the nose. A yeasty, breadiness first hit my tongue as well as some caramel and other sweet malts, followed (and balanced) with some fruit tastes from the hops (I swear I picked up cherry along with citric notes such as orange and lemon). The constant carbonation keeps the beer somewhat creamy and fluffy and lets it pass smoothly even with some pricking down by the hops. Finishes dry but clean and the ABV is not noticeable even if the spices/alcohol warm up the mouth a little. A standard for Belgians and a great beer to sip on."
"Off the tap at American Flatbread this famous Belgian Strong Dark Ale was an appealing garnet color with a two finger head of beige foam. The lacing was outstanding and the retention good. The aroma was complex and pungent, alcohol, dark fruit, wood and rich malt. The flavors were equally loaded, black cherries, caramel malt, Belgian yeast, sweet esters some nuts and citrus rind. The citrusy hops at the end left a bitter note on my tongue that lingered on and on. The oak, rich malts and stronger alcohol gave it an effect similar to a bourbon. The mouthfeel was smooth enough, the body medium/full, the carbonation perfect for the style. Quaffable and dangerous."
"Overall: Great beer, but slightly inferior in taste and value to Duvel."
"MF&D - the feel was nothing like it should have been, for what I have come to understand belgian strong darks. this was watery, lacking carbonation, and very slick going down. I could drink more than one of these but I would really not want to, I found this really unappealing. it wasn't even watery-bad in the way guiness draught is: I dont want to chug this. the beer could have at lease picked up points for making me want to binge."
"D-This is just OK, a bit of a disappointment frankly, as I expected much better than middle road from this. They have been in business since 1654 according to the bottle so I assume they have some fans. I however, am not one."
"Drinkability - The sour of the fruits fits well, but starts to become more prominent as the beer warms. Overall, its a solid beer, but not the best I've ever had."
"This poured a hazy dark copper with lots of tan head. It smelled like earthy sour yeast and lemon hops, with grassy and dried apricot and salty flavors, along with a bit of fresh wheat and cocoa powder. It tasted like dry-roasted barley, and a mix of hops including lemon, grapefruit, and orange peel, as well as sour wild yeast, creamy milk chocolate, and a bit of metallic taste. It was oily with lots of carbonation, and had a sour but malty aftertaste. Overall this was a fairly complex beer, but had a clean taste that's pretty enjoyable. It had good body and hid the alcohol well. It didn't blow me away, and it wasn't super refined, but it was pretty good."
"Pours a dark brown reddish colored body, with a medium sized head, tan brownish in color. Has a strong aroma of flowers, and some dark fruit. A taste of flowers, smooth, sweet almost nutty aftertaste. Similar to other triples."
"D: Good tasting beer, but not the best. Worth it if you get the chance just to have it, but be wary of the price."
"D - It's a slow sipper, to be sure. Beyond the 8.5% ABV, the flavors are just too big for any kind of extended drinking. This is a great beer, but other Belgian Strong Darks seem to me more approachable in this regard."
"D: Minus the shortcomings, it does go down quite easily. Not a bad beer, but overly carbonated, with not too terribly much going on really knocks points off for me."
"Poured a deep, hazy, opaque reddish-brown producing a tight, thick, creamy light brown head that left behind thick sheens of lacing. Smelled predominantly of caramel malts, dark fruit and alcohol. The taste was also dominated by malts and alcohol with a taste of raisins and dark cherries with a very sour finish. Felt full-bodied. OK drinkability for the style, but a little over-the-top sour to have more than one."
"smooth, but with a hint of being slightly watery. moderate carbonation does help to give some body however. very slight astringent and acidic notes in the finish."
"Poured a deep dark mahogany with a bubbly fast fading head. Smells very fruity, tastes like apples and pears maybe something darker. Creamy and bubbly at the same time, this is a good beer for a neg 5 windy day."
"This is sort of middle of the road for the style for me... Not bad, but nothing sets it apart either..."
"Rating a bottle, but this is skewed upward when I had it on tap a few weeks ago at the Thirsty Monk in Asheville. Both are similar, but the bottle has a bit more of of a funky metallic taste that this beer seems to have. The true bottle rating would be lower than this... overall the beer pours a nice ruby red, with a fluffy tan head. Dark, ripe fruit aroma, and some yeast and alcohol is noticeable as well. Flavor is raisiny and rich... Mouthfeel is a bit too carbonated in the bottle form. It's a good beer either way, but on tap is much better... truly a good example of the differences in the flavor of tap and bottle."
"Nice looking bottle... Mahogany colored brew. Very complex taste, lots of different flavors that change as the beer warms. But it isn't all that great. I've had better of this style, but most people are huge fans of this brew. Worth a taste but not one of my favorites."
"As an aside note, with no bearing on the review score: As someone who is studying in the design field, I love the presentation on this. It's very whimsical and pretty at the same time, and it is most likely what caused me to buy this. I was not disappointed with what was kept inside the pretty looking bottle, either. Oops, sorry I wrote too much."
"Drink this beer!"
"D: Not liking the hopiness combined with the carbonation....just not the type of beer that I like. Wouldn't get this again."
"drinkability: very very easy and smooth."
"Very drinkable beer. Little alcohol flavor makes it dangerous. Would definitely like to see this beer in the fridge more often."
"D: once it warms this is very drinkable and enjoyable, albeit somewhat heavy."
"A prolific fluffy tan head sits atop a dark brown brew. Some sediment floats around as the head slowly fades and leaves a thin layer of lacing around the snifter. Smells a bit astringent at first, but quickly some grapes, dark chocolates, grain and yeasts make themselves noticed. Tastes spicy and cholocalty with raisins and taffy floating around on the palate with some more graininess and yeast thrown in for good measure. There's subtle notes of hops in the background with a slight alcohol heat at the very end. Mouth-feel is full bodied with a good amount of carbonation present. The only thing holding this back from perfection is the fact that the aromas and taste could be just a bit bolder. But hey, I'm not bitching, because this is an excellent brew."
"It has three fingers of head with a lot of sediment in the body. The body's color is dark brown with some carbonation. There is quite a bit of lace too. It smells sweet and very sugary like candy sugar and malt. It has a harsh alcohol taste mixed in with the sweetness and there is not much for bitterness. It sort of reminds me of a dark weizen. It has a metallic aftertaste. This beer has a full body."
""
"D- may only have one if I am craving it for some reason...stranger things do happen."
"Mouthfeel is filling, rich, flavorfull,explosive, yet finished and biting. The mouthfull of musty bready yeasty breads is cut by a tart lambic-cherry tartness.Something along the lines of Three Philosophers, the original version if you will. A Wonderfully inviting drink."
"Drinkability: One a year or so would be perfect"
"d - I appreciate what this beer is, but it's just not for me. The medicinal/metallic flavor and spices along with the bitterness just makes for an odd combination that isn't very drinkable for me."
"D - Perfect for the autumn weather but the 8.5 ABV isn't for weaklings; certainly drinkable and I'll be sure to enjoy this time and again. Yum."
"Makes me curious, why do these places only fill their own growlers?"
"Very good beer. I love Belgian Ales, and this is one of the better ones for sure. Its a nice dark brown, with a creamy head. Smells sweet, and tastes that way too - fruity with nice carbonation, too. I could drink another one easily (if I hadn't had so much to drink already). Alcohol is blended well and the flavor of the beer is very pleasant and refreshing."
"Nocturnum is a really great counterpart to D. Tremens. I'd highly suggest drinking one right before the other. Nocturnum is well carbonated and displays flavor and aroma all of what it should: a dark belgian. It pours very nicely with a thin head. Taste has sweetness and a big of spice to it. There is a hint of ginger ale. A bit of floral taste in the sweetness. Moderate mouth which is slightly spicy, nutty, and sweet. A noticeable presence of dark cherry in the flavor and a bit in the aroma too. Some black currant or tart flavors as well. I dont like it as much as I do Tremens, but its still very good."
"This beer is very easy to drink for a full bodied beer; truly a great tasting beer with very balanced flavors."
"D - 4.5 I would drink this all day if I was looking if I was in a Belgian Dark Ale mood"
"D: This beer does the cosmetic things very well. The scent and flavor are unique and challenging. Worth more than just one drink."
"Ah, it's weird like any good Belgian. More so than your average Belgian too, I get a slight peppermint note in the finish. Otherwise there's a very earthy yeast character up front with molasses and dates to follow. The body is very drinkable and this is a beer to try if you like dark Belgians. It almost reminds me of strange weizenbock. Anyways, good beer here."
"Smell/Taste: Much like the Chimay Grande Reserve that I just reviewed previously, accept it has a greater smell/taste of alcohol."
"Warm, spicy nose of cinnamon and cloves, caramel malt, dark apple cider, cola. The mouthfeel is tart and active with fine bubbles, active and alive...conveying a quite wonderfully complex spicy flavor that fulfills the promise of the nose: apples cooked in cinnamon; caramel; cloves; lingering hops make an appearance in the long finish. This is an excellent classic Belgian Strong Dark Ale that evades heaviness with its backbone of crisp tartness."
"M - Bigger body, smooth, less carbonation"
"Less complex and dynamic than the Chimay Blue."
"Notes: I shouldn't compare this and tremens but I cannot resist. I had the tremens for the first time not long ago. I think that right now I prefer the tremens but both are excellent choices."
"A 750 mL bottle of Delirium Nocturnum is on the menu. This heady beer pours into the glass a dark brown color with amber highlights and off-white foam. The aroma is very appetizing: apple, dark fruit, bubble gum, maltiness, spices with some Belgian yeast mixed in. Creamy and medium-bodied on the palate. The flavor is slightly sweet, with musky maltiness, and earthy spices. There is a distinct tartness that envelopes the entire flavor profile. Alcohol noticeable in the finish and dry at the end. A good Belgian dark ale. Definitely worth a try, especially for lovers of the Belgian style."
"D: Probably would not seek this beer out. Bland and boring!"
"Dark, blood red coloring and sweet apple aroma are very interesting for a brew. A light, fizzy body with apple tart sweetness and sourness with some candy sweets as well. An alcoholic taste underlies the entire experience but doesn't disturb the tartness of the beer. A very interesting, almost psychedelic brew that is an enjoyable as it is trippy."
"Pours a deep, rich dark color with an off-white head that appears to be quite fluffy. The nose is VERY unique and appeals to me; fruits, malts, bubble gum, and various spicy and sweet notes. Good carbonation and malts.hops balance this beer very well."
"Second drain pour ever."
"overall-a wonderfully complex beer that is fun to drink"
"It has a nice thick and bubbly head that's about three fingers thick, a light tan color with a little lacing. The head remains thick and fully covers the body, and the lacing is more apparent as it warms up. The body is a dark amber color and is filled with carbonation and is very clear. It has a lightly floral aroma to it along with some dark fruits, spices, and alcohol. It has a very spicy taste mixed in with some prunes and is a bit sweet over all; there is also a mild tartness to it. It has a medium body and is smooth on both the flavor and drinkability; I only tasted the alcohol in its aftertaste and it was a mild alcohol flavor too. This is a really good ale, and yes, I will be buying more of it... and soon too!"
"Drinkability is superb here. Reminds me of an Unibroue offering because of the fact that it's easy to drink and the alcohol is well-hidden. Deceptive. I don't see anything that would make it stand out much more but if you're a fan of this style, do check it out."
"Overall this isn't as fruity as other Belgian Strongs that I've had, but in my opinion that's a good thing. Give it a shot if you haven't already."
"pours a nice, dark brown color with a big, ivory head. the nose is rich malts, hints of maple syrup. on the palate are nice roasty malts, very subtle hops to keep it well balanced. medium to full bodied. very gravy"
"Overall: Very drinkable for sure. Even though the smell of the alcohol came through, I couldn't taste it one bit, dangerous being 8.5% but nice. Not a summer beer by my terms, but nice for a cool day sipper. Very tasty brew!"
"For the style and ABV, just about as drinkable as it gets. And completely delicious. Another excellent example of Belgium's commitment to greatness."
"Drinkability: Fairly enjoyable. Another delightful member of the Delirium Family."
"D-Nice beer, good flavors and body could drink easily. Will revisit, just not brag that I have some in my beer fridge."
"Taste very spicy with clear coriander. Too much for my liking. The malt is lightly roasted, but mild with candisugar and syrupy cane sugar. Alcohol is quite present, warming. Together with the higher alcohols not the most drinkable. Add to that the thin body caused by a lot of sugar and it will add up to a C for me."
"I was a little weary of this one pretty much just because of the weird bottle it was in. It surprisingly had a nice amberish color with a decent head. Smelled a little sweat But didnt taste as sweet as it smelled. I think it is definitley worth a try."
"Very smooth and drinkable. A great purchase."
"D: Drinkable, high alcohol would keep from sessioning. I did enjoy the beer and would definitely not mind having again."
"Superb drinkability."
"I havn't seen any pink elephants yet after drinking. I always enjoy a good Belgian dark ale. Had this one chilled in my Chimay goblet. Poured a deep reddish brown with a firm head. Smell was full of dried fruit, yeast, and a little spice. Taste was deliciously complex with dark cherries, banana, dates, and a hint of chocolate. Alcohol was definitely present and left a heavy feeling with every sip that made me full after just one. A good sipping beer for after dinner and awesome bottle art."
"D - I really liked this beer my biggest complaint about the style is that the alcohol ruins the taste half the time but not with this beer it has a wonderful taste this beer is worth finding to try"
"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass. Pours an orangeish/brown with an ivory head. Leaves some moderate lacing. Smells sweet, fruity, with some spices. Taste is malty and spicy. A lot of yeast in this brew. The setbacks with this beer lie with the mouthfeel. The beer is overly carbonated and makes it nearly undrinkable. The carbonation gave me some pretty awful indigestion. Overall, this beer tastes good... but the carbonation really takes away from this one."
"This beer was a real disappointment. The flavors were quite suppressed and the carbonation was far too intense. Furthermore, the beer tasted much hotter than a typical 8.5% ABV brew should."
"3"" head with great retention and thick lace. Red wood, mahogany color with good clarity. The aroma is full of dark, sweet fruit...caramel apple, some spice, hint of sour and a faint yeastiness. Malty up front followed by toffee and dark fruit (fig) on the tongue. There is a sour flash followed by a somewhat spicy finish. Alcohol is well masked. Medium body and medium carbonation. Very nice drinkability. Very good beer."
"The sweet malt flavor reminds me of Chimay Grande Reserve. Not as sweet or thick as the Chimay, though. Not as complex or enjoyable, either, I'm afraid."
"Tart and yeasty, this beer flows more funky than balanced."
"D: Pretty strong so about one bottle is all I can muster. I had a big bottle of the noel and it knocked Sir Buttchinneth on his chuckerteed ass."
"D- Good, easy to drink. I haven't had this in bottle so it would be interesting to taste side by side bottle and tap. Perhaps later on this week."
"Drinkability is not very high since I don't feel this beer follows its style very much and I don't feel like I could drink very many of these."
"12 oz/$5 (happy hour)/Bohemian Caverns"
"A very nice beer, better a bit warmer."
"This beer accompanied a thick slice of prime rib with a pepper crust and a few slices of fresh sun-dried tomato bread. Not the best pairing for this meal. The sweetness of the beer would have paired much better with a baked sweet potato topped with butter and brown sugar on the side."
"D - I typically like lighter Belgians but this is a very enjoyable beer."
"D: Not terribly complex but just done right. A bit expensive but worth a try."
"drinkability is great. this is a smooth and mellow belgian, with well masked alcohol (8.5% APV) and a solid profile. a wonderful palate of flavors here. cheers!"
"D: Probably shouldn't have opened a 750 for myself because this beer is a littl heavy and the alcohol starts to weigh. Good beer though and worth having in the cellar."
"Lastly anything with a pink elephant on it has to be great!"
"Overall: Not quite as good as Tremens in my book, but still very solid! Great with chocolate."
"Mouthfeel is a hefty medium body but feels a little thin. This is a pretty good beer, but it's just not very robust or interesting."
"25.6 oz bottle. Pours a deep ruby with massive head, off-white that is quickly diminishing. Aroma of malt, yeast, and dark fruits. Initial taste of bread and malt, switching to dark fruits, ending with a balance of all the flavors and aromas with a hint of spice on the tongue. Medium body, moderate carbonation, some lacing, and hints of alcohol noted as it warmed up. Drinkable and better than most Belgians in my opinion."
"Bottle: Poured a dark color ale with a medium foamy head with average retention. Aroma is quite sweet with some candi sugar and plenty of malt. Taste is also a well enough balanced mix of candy sugar, caramel and big malt with some limited yeast characteristics. Body is a bit too watery for the style but the alcohol is well hidden."
"A good Belgium beer to try. It is probably not something I will get again though."
"Nocturnum pours a dark brown with a ruby hue and a thick white head that slowly thins out. The aroma is wonderful and full of ripe fruit, candy and melon. The flavor is full of sweet fruits. Dried apricot, plum, orange marmalade and pineapple. There are sweet bready malts as well that mix with the fruit flavors to give this beer a fruit cake quality that has been laced with warming alcohol. This is a delightful Belgian ale with a full body, average carbonation and a sweet finish."
"M/D - Excellent carbonation and very smooth going down. An all around excellent brew."
"Pours a very dark wood color with a nice tan head that rises up and has yet to show any sign of going down soon. The beer has a very sweet, malty aroma to it. The taste is also very malty with lots of dark fruits, berries, bread and wood. Very rich...very amazing. One of the great beers in my favorite style of Belgian beers."
"Also, just as an aside; I really dug on the packaging of this one."
"Drinkability: Not the best dark beligian, but a nice, unique sugary flavor I can savor. No more than a few for me tonight, however no more in sight. When you're looking for a creamy, desert like sugary and fruity strong beer, this is the one. Go Knicks."
"D = This is an enjoyable beer, it is easy drinking for being as strong as it is."
"Feels very light in the mouth due to all the carbonation which makes this probably more drinkable than it should be."
"This is an exceptional Belgian dark ale. It pours a cloudy, deep tan, frothy head, and ample carbonation. The beer has the smell of caramel, brown sugar, Belgian candied sugars, and a tad bit of alcohol. The only knock on this beer is that there is just too much warming alcohol notes for a beer of 8.5%. This is a full bodied, yeasty, well carbonated beer with plenty of robust malts, candied sugars, chocolate hints, and dark sugar notes. What most impressed me with this beer is the beautiful and creamy mouthfeel. This is like milk chocolate on the tongue. The after taste is a bit too throaty for my tastes. The beer is plenty cloudy, carbonated, and robust. There are also plenty of yeasty bits floating around if you want to pour the sediment into the glass at the end. This is a wonderful beer well worth seeking out. L'Chaim."
"D: I'm going to stick with Delirum T's but may go back to it if i see on tap some place."
"overall, wow this is truly a very good brew that i enjoyed from start to finish"
"D- high ABV along with such a rich and complex body keeps the drinkability at a minimum,overall a delicious and impressive Belgian Dark"
"MF&D - Medium bodied and sweet on the palate. Definitely not my cup of tea."
"The mouthfeel was sticky, leaving a sweet coating covering the inside of the mouth which dissipated to a warm alcohol feel. Too strong to pound and not particularly my style of beer but a decent beer nonetheless. Worth trying but I feel it is an aquired taste, which I have not yet acquired."
"M&D: Rather energetic tiny bubbles as carbonation really drive the mouthfeel for this. They just keep coming giving a little buoyancy to an other wise medium bodied brew. Rather good drinkability but I probably wouldn't drink more than a couple at one sitting, as I would probably opt for something that didn't sit as heavy. All in all a very good brew; recommended."
"D - This is good stuff. Not as outstanding as I found delirium tremens to be, but it's a really well made brew that I can find no fault with."
"All in all....enjoyable! I'm excited to keep on trying these ales, and I think this is a good one, for those of you out in Beerville who haven't tried it yet."
"Just picked this one up today and it I was expecting more. It was good but not amazing. Pours a deep dark red to maroon with a lot of head. Probably 3 fingers at first pour. Dissipates pretty quickly. Smell is above average. Sweet cherries and some citrus maybe grapefruit. The taste I was a little disappointed in. It was not a lot to it. I was really disappointed by this one. Mouthfeel was good and creamy. Drinkability is low because it is a little thick and a little to sweet. for me."
"On the whole, a drinkable beer, with a high complexity to its taste - except for the bitter finish."
"Taste follows the smell nicely, creamy and surprisingly tart. Delirium Nocturnum is unique and satisfying. Recommended!"
"Translucent dark copper-red-brown body with chunks of yeast floating in in it, and a couple inches of light tan head. Scent is complex, including citrus, yeast, chocolate, caramel, and nut, among other things. If the aroma were stronger, it would be perfect IMO. Tastes initially fruity and yeasty, with roasty caramel and chocolate on the finish. Slight nutty and woody qualities round out the flavor. Light-to medium bodied, very refreshing with a fair bit of carbonation. Alcohol is hardly noticeable in either the flavor or mouthfeel."
"Suffice it to say that if you're in the mood for a good Belgian strong dark ale, then look no further. This one has it all -- complex sweet and fruity flavor, uber-creamy head (pour slowly), rich burnt sienna hue. *Highly alcoholic.* The high alcohol content and the richness of this libation may bring on a little heartburn (chasing with Tums recommended). But I will buy this one again..."
"Overall: One of the world's greatest beers, the taste seems to change with every sip. Sweet and spicy one moment, tart and dry the next. If you haven't had this one yet you should do so immediately."
"quite delicious beer, reminiscent in aroma and flavor of many german dopplebocks, though much lighter on the palate. beautifully clean, strong and dark."
"This is going to be one that I will definitely drink again. It is very pleasant overall, I would open another if I had one right now. And as a bonus, the bottle is way cool also..."
"This poured very nicely out of the 750ml bottle. It smelled very sweet, with apples and cherries. It tasted very sweet as well, however it tasted almost candy/syrupyish, making it hard for me to drink all of it. Aside from its drinkability, it was a pretty good beer."
"Very impressive, and in my mind the equal of Noel and close to the truly outstanding Tremens."
"D: a little boozy when it's cold, but better when it warms up, crisp finish, tart character is compelling"
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Smooth, slick, and creamy for most of the tasting... then later it becomes gassier and more expansive in the mouth. Overall a bit of an uneven ride, and definitely not a memorable sampling."
"Purchased from Malone's Bar and grill in Harrisburg, PA. Very strong and powerful beer. taste was great and the color was brilliant. Once again another sipping beer. Not one to drink more than 3 of in a day. It went down smooth and there wasnt a bad aftertaste."
"The taste does not let me down. Lots of dark (rum), alcohol filled fruits, yeasty spices, herbal hops and just a touch of sourness."
"From an elegant marble-like white bottle with attractive blue foil and cork, this 1 pint 9.4 fl oz bomber pours a beautiful mahogany brown, ruby-reddish color with a full-five-fingeer gigantic head that simply would not disappear... huge frothiness which almost over-poured the serving glass... really like Delirium Tremens, so had high hopes for Nocturnum, which didn't disappoint... slightly malty, fruity smell wih fig and plum aroma - very appealing, with a dark, brown-sugar, sweet flavor that really burst through... a slight winter-warmer taste with fig flavors pouring through... wonderful flavor, exceptional taste with a great mouthfeel and surprisingly easy drinkability for an 8.5% ABV... Full of cinnamon, butterscotch, and caramel flavors... would never notice the alcohol in this one behind a rich conglomeration of flavors... I could enjoy this brew anyday, a wonderful sample, wish they had it in six-packs, although I wouldn't mind paying $8.99 again for this one... Definitely recommended... just as good as the Tremens, if not better..."
"Pours a clean deep copper, reddish brown notes in the color and a tan head. In the aroma, a sweet white grape. In the taste, mostly white grape, a touch of dark fruit, and a small alcohol presence. A smooth, bigger bodied mouthfeel and a semi-dry fruity aftertaste. Easy to drink, a nice fruity presence and it hides the alcohol well."
"Very good, although the sweetish malt tastes are a little bit overwhelmed by the pronounced spiciness."
"My first BSDA and I'm definitely impressed. Sweet fruit up front and sour fruit in the back, how do they pull that off? Very good beer."
"Pours a nice ruby brown color with a nice and tight tan head that dissipated into a decent cap. The smell is of slightly roasted malt, brown sugar, and dark fruit esters. The taste is of dark fruit; plums, raisins and perhaps a hint of carob or bakers chocolate. There is some Belgian yeast funk and as well as some wine like characteristics. The feel is moderate and fizzy, finishes pretty balanced, more on the sweet side. A good BSDA that stays within its boundaries. There is no excess alcohol/candi sugar to bomb this brew out like many other BSDAs. Perhaps not the most flavorful BSDA but very drinkable and recommended."
"I don't know why, but I always want my BSDA's to have a touch more body and alot more flavor."
"Poured into my Maudite snifter. Presents with a generous foamy off-white head with decent retention. Generous lacing that left a viscous ring around the rim. Foam eventually dissipated into a consistent skim with ample Belgian ringlets. Brown in color with hints of red (a little lighter than a plum). Absolutely no light penetration when backlit. Scent of Belgian yeast and dark fruit (plum, raisins and a hint of cherry perhaps. Taste similar to nose with a little bit of tartness and pucker at the finish. Mouthfeel was lively on the tongue with a nice body that was not too watery and not too syrupy. Good drinkability; alcohol was extremely well hidden. A solid example of a Belgian Strong Dark Ale."
"This could be one if the greatest ales Ive every had."
"Pours a dark brown that has a lot floating around in it. Nose is just a clump of sugar. And I don't like it. Flavor is yeasty, bitter and funky. Sharp caramel edge on the backside. Feel has a lot of carbonation to it and a typical liquid feel. Overall this is an okay beer. Two years ago I might have been more interested in this beer, but then again, maybe not. With so much other great stuff out there, I don't really see why I should bother with this one here."
"A nice beer. Bottle gives almost No information about the brew. A change in the label design would be appreciated. I didn't know what to expect."
"Very drinkable, and still decent, just not as flavorful as I expected."
"Drinkability - I could definitely drink more than a couple at a time but with the decently high ABV (no Dark Lord, but 8.2%), I don't know if that would be a great idea. Will drink again."
"Medium-bodied - smooth and creamy, but thinner than expected. Great drinkability - alcohol stays in check. Solid Belgian."
"A truly solid belgian experience, at least of what I've had thus far."
"Review added 11-25-2007, translated from french 3-2-2008."
"pours a very dark amber hue with a brown colored head. smell is very yeasty and malty. taste is very yeasty, with malty flavors as well, the alcohol warms the tongue. mouthfeel is full and wonderul, very drinkable beer, wish it was more widely available."
"Overall, not really what I expected. Lots of fruitiness, but also alot of stout flavors. Definitely worth a try."
"man, does it taste superfruity, as well. i'm not sure i like that. fusel-y. too. the followup is maltier, with a more down-to-earth feel. the fruitiness grows on me some, but it's a course drink"
"D - This is a highly quaffable brew but sessionable I don't think so, the alcohol content and the fact that to me it was a ""hot"" alcohol as you would find with a liquor make it something that you would want to finish your night out with..not make a night of."
"D- Drinkability factor was just low because of the thickness. Could not drink more than a couple of these. Way too rich for a session beer."
"Drinkability - this is a good ale, but not a great one. That, along with its abv limits its sessionability."
"bottle poured reddish brown with an off white head that lasts for the druatiion of the beer. Small yeast particules bob up and down with the carbonation. Aromas of dates yeast, and dry fruit The mouthfell is creamy with the nice feeling of cabonation it also finishes a little dry. It tastes like sweet grapes (almost wine ) malt along with a llite taste of hops in the end is quite nice .The pink elephant on the bottle reminds me of the one that they had in front of the detox center in danvers Mass when it was open LOL. a good Belgian strong ale I drink it again"
"M/D: Heavy on the carbonation. Full bodied but silky smooth. Good drinkability. Great beer overall."
"This is an elegant brew. Complex and tasty. Dreamy...appropriately named - a wonderful nightcap. I think I see pink elephants...oh - I'm just looking at the bottle ;) As wonderful as it is the 11.2 oz bottle was enough to end the day with and to send me to a blissful state of sleep. Strongly recommended as a tasty nightcap!"
"D- Behind the harsh carb. this beer reveal complex flavors if allowed to sit. A once in a while Strong Ale if I'm going for something middle of the road. Maybe a little overpriced."
"Pours a dark almost mahogany color with an airy light tan head that fades fairly quickly with little lacing. You can smell the alcohol immediately along with the dark fruits. The body is as airy as the head was and the mouth feel is much lighter than my favorite Strong Dark Ales. The alcoholic characteristic is masking a dark fruit flavor. All in all it's a reasonable drinker."
"D: A good beer beer. Surprisingly light and easy drinking despite high alcohol content. I'll be picking up another bottle for two for the winter months."
"Although I recently started reviewing beers I've been drinking them for a long time and this beer is truly unique. This beer is an absolute orgy to the nose and mouth. Smells resembled that of grape bubble yum, granny smith apples, banana flavored baby food and apricots all rolled into one - excellent! Taste was a small explosion of the above and as the drink warmed it mellowed with the alchohol more present and sweet malts. Texture was smooth , almost silky with little carb, medium weight. Aside from the sediment that slowly floated like stars on a cool New Hampshire evening the overall appearance was pretty average, striking shiny copper. Didn't know what to expect from this style but this particular beer is on top of it's game. Between the ABV and overall sweetness I wouldn't recommend this as a session but maybe something to start the barbeque off with. If this review peaks your curiosity, get up , go out and give this a shot and share it with someone who might appreciate it. Cheers!"
"A dark copper-brown color with tons of large floaties perfectly suspended throughout. A thinnish off-white head but solid with decent lacing. Smells like apple sherry, a kind of fermenting apricots and banana mixture, liquor-like. The taste is sweet with heavy fruit but more of a grape feel mixed with what was noted in the aroma. Pretty heavy alcohol but not over the top. Still, between the alcohol dominance and the sweetness, I wouldn't want to drink too much of this at one sitting. Definately a taste treat, give it a try. I would buy it again. Quality stuff for sure."
"I did not like this as much as Delirium Tremens. It was a fine brew, but it did not go down as smooth as their take on the Belgian Strong Pale Ale. Still complex in its flavors and rich in its maltiness. It just seemed to miss for me and was not as pleasant to drink. I found myself wanting to move on to my next beer. Maybe it was just a bad night..."
"The Delerium Nocturnum pours a deep dark murky red. A nice cream colored bubbly head lingers leaving a sticky lace. Smell is hoppy fruit, over a rum like alcohol base. Taste is semi bitter malts. Warm fruits and bread as well. I chose this as my desert beer at dinner, and liked it a lot in that role. The alcohol makes another appearance in the mouth. Very balanced in the end, and a beer I enjoyed immensely."
"Mmmm. Tasty Belgian. Pours a cloudy mahogany color with a bubbly medium size head that dies out fast. Some lacing. Great aroma, medium astringency and dark fruit. The taste is very good. Some hint of alcohol but not unpleasant, dark fruits (plum), some sweetness and an astringency that is just right, not overdone. A great sipping beer. Mouthfeel is rich. Drinkability is fairly good for a high alcohol beer. The sweetness will get you over the long run. Two would be tops for one session. This is a very nice Strong Ale."
"Mouthfeel & Drinkability: Up front carbonation is great, and certainly one of my favorite characteristics of belgian strongs. This is a drinkable beer, and taken slowely I could drink two of these 11oz bottles. An admirable beer."
"Poured this into the only glass on hand, an imperial pint glass. It came out deep garnet red with a bubbly, sodapop head, but none of the retention mentioned in other reviews. Smell was vaguely cidery with alcoholic hints to it. It tasted alcoholic up front with notes of apple and raisins and almost a mulling spiciness. Traces of yeast and malt were detectable in the aftertaste. It was soft in the mouth depsite the bubbly carbonation and went down fairly well. I was definitely glad to try this brew from Huyghe."
"As for drinkability, I will finish this 750 no problem. I was going to share this one, but I'm suddenly glad no one else showed up for brew day :-)"
"Drinkability: The alcohol is definitely noticeable in this, but then that's part of what makes it good. Not a session beer by any means, but very nice and a pleasure to drink. Really, really nice with Emmental."
"Drinkability is not impressive- even taking into account the style and abv."
"D- Easily drinkable especially at closer to room temperature. Goes down pretty smooth."
"Not bad at all. But there are better options out there for this style."
"Drinkability: A good Belgian Strong, perhaps not quite at the top of the class, but quite worthy."
"Interest in this brewer's creations began with my introduction to Delerium Tremens a few years back. Brouwerij Huyghe is a fine brewery and my experience with the corked and caged bottled version of this strong dark Belgian wasn't a disappointment, but it wasn't extraordinary either. I blame this on the fact that you can't tell the age of the beer until you remove the cork. In this instance, it couldn't have been more than four months old since it was stamped 2007. As such, this was a young brew which unfortunately wasn't mature enough to drink. Once the cork was removed, I understood what the notched January 2007 meant on the back of the bottle. The brewery should change the label to indicate the date is a ""born on"" date. Anyway, no turning back now that the cork is out. Another danger sign was the cork itself which came out bone dry and again spoke to the maturity of the brew. The color was a reddish brown and it was suprisingly and aggresively carbonated. The head consequently had balls and managed to hang on most of the way. As I drank more from the glass, the head became creamy almost buttery in color. The aroma was mild with hints of fruity, citrusy esters with notes of percolated coffee grinds and alcohol. The taste was carbonated and mild, with alcohol in the finish. Chewy and dry with coffee bitterness. The mouthfeel was dry and yet slightly yeasty up front. Not a viscous texture. This is a drinkable but somewhat uninspired brew, yet I will give it a whirl again after letting my next bottle age. Not as interesting as it's comrade Tremens, but still worth the price."
"Tasty overall, but that alcohol character starts to dominate after about half a bottle. Still pretty good though."
"-Oelergud"
"Overall: Spicier than other strong darks Ive tried; this one tastes like a strong pale or spiced white ale but also has elements of a strong dark. A pretty moderate Belgian, nonetheless, and as such is likely more palatable to novices. A sturdy brew all around. Recommended."
"Then it takes a minute or two to feel the alcohol in the back of the throat. This might be a bad bottle."
"750ml corked and caged bottle poured into a tulip glass. Pours a hazy dark brown color with very active carbonation and a large fluffy head. The aroma is filled with a lot of yeast and bready notes with a faint tartness and some pears. The taste is slightly tart and malty with some spices and a finish that is bone dry. The mouthfeel is light and extremely prickly from the high amount of carbonation."
"Poured a nice dark brown, deep hazy color with tons of carbonation. Biggest cream colored head I have ever seen! Never did fully fade. Seriously felt like it took an hour to fade. Very lively spicey smell, Dark fruits all over this one, plum, peach, pear. Hints of great spices like nutmeg and cinnamon. Huge carbonation even tingled the nose. Huge frothy full and appeazing mouthfeel, with great texture and body. Taste is sweet versus sour in a battle that has no clear cut favorite. Sour apple and peach taste is great. Big hoppiness on this really suprised me. A nice long lingering finish. This was a great Belgian and worth its reputation. Very awesome brew and will definatly seek this one out again."
"Gotta love the pink elephant on the label!"
"It's a decent beer, but it's hardly as good as I've been led to believe. The smell and taste seem a bit too simplistic for this type of beer, and something seems off with them. And the beer feels wrong too. Nice attempt at a beer, but it doesn't hold a candle to many other Belgian Strong Dark Ales that I've had."
"Pours dark ruby color with nice 2 finger head. No lacing. Smell is yeast and dark fruit. Taste is a nice dark fruit with lots of yeast and a hint of carmel. Finishes with dry woody hops. Slight alcohol burn at lower temperatures goes away with some warming. Perfect compliment to a pot roast. Recommended."
"Not bad at all. Not the best belgian strong dark out there, but a fairly quaffable one. It does lack some complexity and is rather uninteresting, but it's worth a try if you haven't had it."
"Eric"
"Lots of sourness on the nose--kind of vinous as well. There are elements of fruit like a plum or dark cherry. Some almond like aspects are also noticed both on the nose and the palate. A little overcarbonated in mouthfeel and the alcohol heat is fairly subtle but it is noticed more and more as you work your way through this and it does affect the drinkability to a negative degree but it is good on a cold evening. I prefer the Tremens by this brewery and there are much better Belgian strong dark ales out there."
"I poured my glass from the ever popular 750ml ""ceramic"" bottle. Upon my pour, this beautiful Belgian was a dark brown, almost mahogany color, also a touch of caramel. This was a preview of things to come. Mine poured with a three finger head, which was a little rocky. The aroma was a mix of fruits, with citrus being the most prevalent. The taste proved this to be accurate. Their was the hint of fruits, however, this taste was accompanied by a maltiness and the caramel I spoke of before. I suppose I just missed this when smelling. Mouthfeel was good, nothing out of the ordinary, but you could feel a little citrus tingle. Very minor hang with this beer, which was nice, little to no aftertaste. Drinkability was outstanding and at 8.5% alcohol, that is a bad combination. I prefered this just a bit more that the Tremens and will be purchasing some more very soon."
"750ml brown bottle made to look ceramic. Translucent dark copper-red-brown body with chunks of yeast floating in int and a couple inches of light tan head. Scent is complex, including citrus, yeast, chocolate, caramel, and nut, among other things. If the aroma were stronger, it would be perfect IMO. Tastes initially fruity and yeasty, with roasty caramel and chocolate on the finish. Slight nutty and woody qualities round out the flavor. Light-to medium bodied, very refreshing with a fair bit of carbonation. Alcohol is hardly noticeable in either the flavor or mouthfeel. Wow. This beer is superb, damn near perfect. Probably my new favorite beer."
"Imagine that drinking this one all night would produce a nasty hangover with all the sugars in there. Not at all sessionable for my tastes. Might serve as a good introduction to brett tang for brett novices. Glad i tried it, wont be back anytime soon."
"Again, I'll have to try it again now that my tastes have evolved a bit."
"recommended"
"Drinkability: A very drinkable Belgian Strong Dark Ale. Quite complex with pleasant fruitiness and great feel in the mouth. A solid choice."
"This is a great nightcap beer that really fits it's namesake. I'll see another bottle of this in my snifter in the future."
"The bottom line: not what I was expecting, but enjoyable nonetheless. Will definitely have again."
"Poured a nice dark reddish brown color with a massive head that took a while to subside. Aroma was of roasted malts, spices and a little bit of a winey aromas in the nose. Taste was of caramelly malts, clovy yeast and a slight spicy hoppiness in the finish. A sour/winey note was also noted as the beer warmed to room temperature. Mouthfeel was medium to full bodied. Drinkability was good. Alcohol was barely evident making this beer far too easy to drink. An excellent deal from a local grocery store at $5.49 for a 750ml bottle."
"A great way to ring in the New Year."
"Drinkability: I'm going through a large bottle on my own and probably won't drink that much in one sitting again. I'd love a glass of this now or again, however."
"Well done."
"Body is about medium, with a spritzy, well carbonated texture and a slippery, smooth mouthfeel. A very easy-going example that could pass as a dubbel."
"Just bought a bottle at the end of '06 to find a delightful surprise - the cork indicates a bottling in '04. Gotta love pre-aging. Pours a deep reddish-brown with a beautiful smooth and VERY dense head. Almost on par with a nitro-gassed pint. Smells of raisins, cinnamon, and bubblegum? Taste is a thing of beauty. Fruity yeast up front (those raisins and a bit of orange) followed very quickly by a wonderful, sweet, carmelly malt. Aftertaste mellows into the more esoteric flavor components, oaky with a sharp slightly coppery (although pleasant) finish with some alcohol warmth. The mouthfeel is very carbonated, which I love but is not everyone's cup of tea (so to speak), oily and a little chewy at the end. Definitely lets you know you've drank something substantial. For me, about as good as it gets, really. Very drinkable, this one. I could easily overdo this 8.5% boy if not careful."
"A 750ml bottle poured into a tulip glass. A very pretty beer: dark red/brown with a thick coffee-colored head. Good retention. Aroma was dark fruit, a little malt. Sweet taste, cherries, apples. Very pleasant. Taste deepened as the beer warmed. Smooth, very drinkable."
"Nice, but my least favorite from the brewery."
"Drinkability: This is one to be enjoyed slowly, more flavor pops out as the beer warms. A nice companion when reading or enjoying an evening of philosophical conversation with friends."
"A good dark ale. Interesting complex beer inside of an interesting bottle. Recommended."
"D: For myself this beer took some work to knock back, though my fiance loved it. Once you get past the bubbly champange like carbonation and let it warm to room temp this beer is quite enjoyable."
"I'm not quite as delirious about Delirium Nocturnum as I was about Delirium Tremens, but that's probably due to the fact that I like BSPAs more than I like BSDAs. This is still fabulous beer and would make a great nightcap. It might even induce dreams of pink elephants, who knows?"
"Bottle: Poured a dark color ale with a medium foamy head with average retention. Aroma is quite sweet with some candi sugar and plenty of malt. Taste is also a well enough balanced mix of candi sugar, caramel and big malt with some limited yeast characteristics. Body is a bit too watery for the style but the alcohol is well hidden."
"Medium bodied and very bright obtrusive carbonation. Just an all around great beer, and one I would like to be able to afford to come back to often."
"Overall I enjoyed this ale and will certainly try it again sometime."
"The beer pours a rich dark copper with a fine tan head. The aroma was of spice and sweet malt. The taste is very subtle, it is a muted sweet malt with hints of spice and dark fruits in the finish. The feel is very smooth, but not oily. It also has a nice alcohol burn in the finish. A bit muted, but overall a fine beer."
"Overall, not a bad beer, but is on the bottom of bsda list... Nothing really stands out to make it a great beer. their tremens is a whole lot better."
"Drinks very easy for the abv, not a bad effort, but depth & complexity is missing. An okay dark belgian"
"D- Nice, but I can get much better for the same price or less."
"A carefully decanted pour into my La Moneuse tulip raises a slight glass ring for a head, no more. The body is a murky ruby brown that is utterly opaque in the center. Lacing is miniscule. The smell is peppery and sweet, loading with lots of dark fruity scents like cherry, plum, perhaps dates, and grapes. The taste is hard to decribe: sweet, vinous, cherries, various fruit notes. Finishes pretty cleanly. There's not a lot of depth, but what is there deserves respect. The mouth is on the lighter side, with a very high and sharp combination, which probably helps to mask the high alcohol. Very enjoyable, and certainly something that I'd like to revisit."
"I enjoyed this beer and found it highly drinkable even with high ABV. Will pick up again but maybe in the 75cL bottle."
"This beer poured a basically opaque brown with a large head. The smell is sour and a bit malty. The taste is sweet and spicy with some floral accents  a bit sour too. Noticeable hops that balances well with the malt. The mouthfeel is full but mostly dominated by the carbonation, which lends an interesting addition to the flavors. This is a tasty beer, but a bit much to go down smooth for a prolonged session."
"Slightly disappointing, I expected a bit more from this one...not quite in the same league as, say, Ommegang or Maudite."
"Mouthfeel is fine except the clumps of sediment and drinkablility isnt great because of the tartness. Not sure exactly if the tartness is from the age or if it is that way naturally. A pretty full-bodied ale that is pretty decent. I will try a fresher one out of curiosity."
"Highly recommend."
"This is a fine beer."
"D: One of my go-to dark Belgians, and the first one I ever sampled; however, it seems to have lost a bit of its luster as I've tried others in the style that I feel surpass it. Still darn good, though."
"Way cool bottle cork 1pint 9,4 oz [love that crazy European notation]"
"D: Wonderful Belgian--I've had this on tap an it's a ton better than in the bottle. Smooth but thick. A very tasty brew."
"The taste expands on the aroma. Pleasant caramel maltyness that complements the alcohol nicely. Floral and fruity. Mouthfeel is above average but not spectacular, clean and watery. This one's a keeper."
"Cheers!"
"Edit and afterthought.... after reading some other reviews...I'm wondering if I got a bad bottle, because the tartness in mine was overpowering vs. the sweetness everyone is describing.... oh well."
"this is a damn fine belgian ale. a nice way to end the night for me. good night and cheers!"
"D - Stellar here. It is dangerously easy to finish the fifth. It is enjoyable to drink, but not enough so that I will seek it out again."
"D = Not very drinkable due to the wet mould smell."
"Note: Pink elephants are cool."
"Easy to drink and good, with a slightly different take on the style."
"Drinkability: like mentioned above, I would drink this again. It's a little much for me to drink more than one."
"M: medium body falls well in mouth, carbonation is slightly high and seems to take away from from some of the flavors of this ale."
"Nocturnum, overall is some of the best we've had as far as the Belgian Strong dark. We'll be adding this one to the cellar stock."
"The taste is sweet up front, but not nearly as much as the aroma might suggest. The sweetness couples with a tartness, both of which help to amplify a concentrated fruitiness. Again, notes of figs and raisins are prominent, but these are joined by notes of prunes and even some tart plum. The beer finishes with a faint roasted note, that shows up more as a burnt acidity, a bit of a spicy note (reminiscent of tongue tingling ginger, and white pepper) and a touch of higher alcohol notes. This beer is quite drinkable, despite its sweetness, the beer is quite light as it slips down your throat. It does have enough sweetness to linger a bit on the palate. Certainly an enjoyable tipple, one which I have not had for some time."
"A very good beer, I just question the price of this one."
"This was carbonated as hell so pour this one slower than you think you need to. IT poured a gorgeous color with a nice billowing beige head. The aroma is sweet as fuck. Mostly smell slike dark fruits. Kinda harsh at times. The taste was similar to other dark belgians but this one had an upleasant cought syrup sweetness to it. I suppose this could be the alcohol. The mouthfeel wass medium and smooth. The harshness of the taste though keeps this from being that drinakble. Half a 750ml was enough for me. IT kinda got boring afterwards."
"D - It is an outstanding taste beer. However, it is heavy and quite potent."
"I brought this beer home from the shop and my wife offered to pour it in a mug for the both of us while I stepped out for a minute. When I returned, I was looking at this huge head and a beer that smelt absolutely fantastic - better than any beer I had had before. And it had a taste to match the smell. We're regular beer drinkers but this beer gave us a buzz in the first couple of sips. That may be attributed to the 8.5% alcohol by volume that's significantly higher than other beers. If you like nut brown ales, this beer is the grandmaster of them all. Definitely worth a try. As for me, I can totally see myself buying this beer and bringing it home often."
"Not bad. Poured a cloudy red bronze colour with an off-white foamy head the went away pretty quickly, but returns with a little agitation. Taste is fairly typical for the style; damp basement, stewed fruit, plenty of dark malts. Nice. I had forgotten how much I enjoyed this style. Taste is nearly identical to the smell. There is, however, a bit of a metallic taste present here, which I find quite odd. It isn't very strong, in fact, it becomes less noticeable as you drink throught the beer, but it is mildly unpleasant, but not terribly so. This is is lovely representation of the style. One I'd likely purchase again."
"Extremely coarse and carbonated, this is bursting with ripe fruit, but the flavors are detracted by the over carbonation. This is rather unpleasant, and getting through the bottle will be difficult."
"D - Smooth and tasty this beer was definatly a beer full of complexitys and unique flavor and character."
"An excellent Belgian Strong Dark Ale, and for the price, one of the best. Definitely check this beer out."
"This beer is great on the palate. I only wish that it had a bit more body. For a bigger beer such as this it would be nice to have a bit more body, but I guess that has to be sacrificed when brewing a stronger beer such as this. This is a beer that I will definitely be coming back to. The next time I see it I'll be buying it. Goes down easy and has a low carbonation to compliment the the complex flavor of this beer."
"A truly spectacular appereance, deep chestnut with reddish purple highlights. A massive head that left thorough lacing. Really attractive. Aroma yeasty, with deeper 'barnyard funk' notes. That, and the taste, ample with hints of dried fruits, darker caramely malts, and plenty of yeast. Somewhat average in both those categories. Fairly light bodied, carbonation well controlled. No hint of alcohol what so ever. A nice Belgian ale. Quite pleasing minus the fact that no taste seems to linger. I experience an unfortunate abrupt dry finish that really cuts the beer short of being anything more than good."
"D - Drinkable. This is my first Delirium brew, and it's pretty tasty."
"I'll probably try this again, but I'll mainly stick with DT."
"Delirum Nocturnum pours an opaque dark brown with a tan head from a 330 ml brown bottle that has been coated with a grey opaque coating (I wish hoppy beers would follow suit, little or no chance of light damage this way). Aroma is grapey. Taste is strong and different. Definitely some vinous qualites, funky aftertaste. Not my thing, but worth a try."
"This pours a deep dark mahogony with a giant foamy head. The head, as with most Belgians, leaves very nice lacing. The smell is weaker than I expected with a only a small hint of candy sugar present. The taste is sweet with candy sugar, dark fruit, and malt. A decent tasting beer,although it is alittle thin. The m/f is light with a decent mixing of flavors and the alcohol is well hidden. A good beer all around and one that I shall try again."
"Poured from a 375 ml bottle into an oversized wine glass. Big foamy white head that dissapated quickly leaving almost no lace. Dark Brown in color. Sour Dough Yeast on the nose. The beer had a malty sweetness with a bit of spice on the end. Slight caramel with a bitter chocolate finish. Definately could taste the abv (9%) which gave it quite a zip. Complex and bubbly (like champagne) on the tongue. Overall a good belgian beer, but not the best. It screamed for something sweet, so I ate some ice cream with it, it seemed to get better!"
"D - Quite nice, but lacked depth. Not something I would rush to try again."
"EDIT: After later reading positive reviews, I should try another bottle. Maybe mine was no good? Maybe they don't make it like they used to? Still, gotta tell it like I see it."
"Very drinkable as a night cap or sipper."
"The pink elephant on the bottle and the glass makes the experience of course, but the beer could be a lot better."
"Overall: The wine-like characteristics of this Belgian are strong, but not so much that they distract from the estery characteristics. I'd hesitate to call it a fruit wine because I don't feel I'm versed enough in untraditional wines to make that parallel. Having said that, I don't find the flavor so complex that it mires one in the flavor at the expense of the other attributes. I enjoyed looking, smelling and feeling it as much as I did drinking it."
"Decent enough mouthfeel, but not a beer that I would return to. Actually struggled to finish this one. Maybe it's just me (or my tastebuds), but I was very disappointed with this beer. I like it even less than D. Tremens; maybe it would improve if aged."
"The color of this beer is a dark brown with a depth of crimson and a bit of haze. Modest head. The aroma here is very intriguingI get a lot of dark fruits: berries, black cherries, raisins. Its almost reminiscent of a fruity wine. Theres also a bit of spice and yeast, with a sugary, molasses and malt quality. Not bad. The taste is equally interesting. Slight sourness, with a compelling fruitiness. At one moment its fleetingly sweet, then refreshingly tart. The alcohol comes out after a few sips, but isnt present at the start of the glass. It certainly picks up a warming quality as you enjoy it. Finish is more or less dry. Medium body here, with very low carbonation. I wouldnt call this one outstanding; nothing really grabbed me and said this is terrific. What this beer is, however, is interesting and fun. Lots of different flavors."
"The beer really lacks in body. There is a wispy feel, that isn't quite water but still lacking overall. Carbonation is great. Overall this was a good beer but the body creates a void. Maybe the Elephants were getting into my beer."
"in my note i gave this beer an over all of 2, which suprized me i'm a hudge fan of there other beers that are available in my area. this was the first time i had this one and will sample again and post that as a second rewiew."
"This is a really good brew, but not as good as the competition."
"Overall - An OK beer... maybe slightly harsh... Worth a try but i think the Delirium Tremens is much better..."
"Flavor is deep and caramely. Dark fruits build the majority of the flavor... plum, figs, and tart apples. Also sports a tinge of smokiness. Hints of leather and wood."
"definitely worth trying once. twice if you like it."
"Dark Brown. Strong, alcoholic aroma of chocolate, coffee, dark malts, dark fruits, strawberries and bourbon. Potent, poorly hidden alcohol, strong bourbon taste among other things like chocolate, coffee, herbs and dark fruits. Huyghe is one of Belgium's worst."
"11.2 ounce bottle."
"This one tastes so nice with all sorts of fruit flavors followed up by a much smoother alcohol flavor than expected(especially since this is 8.5 abv). This brew is such a good one. Are there better Belgians out there? Yes, but when looking at four or five choices, this is one that I will not hesitate to buy again as it is consistenly very good."
"This is a decent enough beer. Not earth shattering or anything, but a pretty damn good Belgian dark. The alcohol is very well hidden. Most of the flavors are on the subdued side, except for the dark caramel candy taste. Overall, a fine brew."
"Served up from a 33cl bottle into a tulip glass as a lively dark brown with some residual yeast flecks. Tremendous off-white head and very intricate lacing. Nose speaks of a wonderful sweetness, malty, yeasty, and fruity, but most of all carries a unique candy-like scent. Excellent. Taste is malty and semi-sweet initially, with some spicy hints lingering and a bit of hop dryness. Medium-bodied at best, with quite a lot of carbonation. I like this beer ... one of the most unique Belgian dark ales I've had. The cotton candy, bubble gummy taste is subtle yet pervasive ... unique is the best way I can describe it. Highly drinkable, I think, and recommended!"
"Pours a nice head that falls into a thin unbreakable layer without a lacing. Smells very nice and appealing, like belgian sugar beer. It's very sweet and very carbonated. Almost a bitter sweet tartness to it's aftertaste. The mouthfeel turns me away, it's harsh."
"[ serving type: bottle ]"
"Mmmm mmmm mmmm mmm"
"Drinkability: I liked this beer but it didnt stand out in the crowd. Id easily have another but Id prefer so many other Belgian beers."
"Cheers2Beers"
"Dwonderfully different IMHO, would love another. The bottle is funreminds me of the scene in Dumbo where Dumbo gets drunk (accidentally) and sees Pink Elephants on ParadeI have a kid, so I have watched the movie many ,many times. A great beer that everyone should try at least once."
"All in all, very quaffable."
"I think further cellaring and conditioning may bringout a better flavor."
"Not something I'd like to drink all night long, but thats because of its intense flavor and severe ABV."
"D: Not enough sweet and sour balance in the malt flavors. I liked it but its not the kind of brew you would drink many of in a row."
"This is a fine example of a Belgian strong dark ale. It is very well balanced. Although it can be a bit pricy, it is a nice treat every now and then."
"While the taste was quite complicated I found that it wasn't the best combination of tastes... from the smell I expected this to taste a lot better. In the end however, all these tastes were fighting a battle over my palate and I couldn't really enjoy this beer like I though I was going to."
"overall i recommend this one. it has been added to my ""in the mood for a belgian"" list."
"This beer poursed a dark sienna color and left a small head that disappated quickly, the smell of this beer is dried fruit (plum,apricots, and raisin). As I tasted this beer the malty character came to the front, sweet with a small amount of bitterness that finished smooth with a fruit dose on the palate."
"This beer poured a medium brownish color with a nice off white head that faded after a couple minutes into a slight foam around the edges of the glass. The smell was great with some sour apple scents along with spices and a touch of alchohol. I loved the dry taste of this beer mixed with just the right ammount of malt sweetness and spice to balance it out. The sour apple flavor reappeared in the middle of this beer and finished nice and dry so I could not wait for the next sip. A great beer and definantly worth the price."
"Has a nice thick and creamy mouthfeel and is very drinkable at 8.5abv. I'd pick this up again but have had better belgian strong dark ales."
"The mouthfeel is dry and has a bit of a metallic finish. Not too drinkable at all. I think I possibly got a spoiled bottle. I will try another from the batch and probably more from future batches, but I don't particularly want to seek out another source for it."
"Very nice, complex, interesting brew. I had seen this one countless times and I finally gave in and tried it. The complexity and the ways that it changes from beginning to end make it a very interesting, tasty brew that I would highly recommend."
"Drinkability: I think this is my choice over Delirium Tremens (as the Noel I haven't had) for the pink elephant Belgian brews. Considering the hype surrounding Delirium Nocturnum, its expectations have been met as far as I'm concerned. Surely a great example of the style."
"D: After the great experience I had with Delerium Tremens, I was really looking foward to this one. Oh well. I'm hoping I got a bad bottle, so maybe I'll try this one again."
"This beer is like being with your girlfriend at a nightclub. You take her beauty for granted because it is so subtle, and look at other women; but then she slaps your face and smiles, saying look at me-she commands your attention. will not be shared or ignored. Thats the way this beer is."
"Opinion: I think that this is a pretty good beer. It has an interesting balance of malt and spice. It also warms up very well. I tend to like the darker, richer beers better in this style, but this one has plenty of depth to the flavor. I would prefer a bit more rounding of the darker malts to bring this beer to life."
"Drinkability: A very good beer, but lacks the complexity and the polished nature of the very good belgians."
"Nicely drinkable - a perfect nightcap brew."
"This is a pretty solid ale, but is a little sweeter than I prefer. If you like belgian ales, its worth a try."
"Not a bad beer, but in this price range you can do better."
"Poured out dark amber. slight tan colored head, low head. No noticeable lacing. Smell of fig, bread, some graininess. Tastes of grape, fig, earthy, some pepper resemblance in the back of the throat in the finish. Malty, with some fruitiness ( cherries, grape jumped out at me). Moderate carbonation leaves tingling in throat. Some what dry in the finish. Overall a very nice drinkable beer, not too high alcohol, nice aroma, taste, mouthfeel. Highly recommend"
"11.2 oz bottle. Pours cola brown, with a big, big, creamy, tan head. Complex aroma of red wine grapes, dark bread, and significant alcohol. The taste is hard to compare to anything else. The grape taste is dominant, reminding me of grape juice but with a medicinal cough syrup quality that was weird at first sip but grew on me quickly. The malts become dominant, with a nice dark caramel character. The alcohol is strong, and will quickly warm your throat. Like its paler sibling, this is a big, unique beer that takes some getting used to, but it's very rewarding and incredibly complex. Buy it if you find it."
"Fluffy tan head, tastes of of chocolate malts, brown sugar, prunes, raisins, dark rum, bit of the alcohol, figgy liquorice aroma, laces nicely on my glass, I like this stuff because it tastes really good, dark belgian candy sugar finishes dry, dark brown cola-like color. (that was a run-on sentence, cause I liked it!)"
"All in all pretty damn drinkable for a belgian dark (which is certainly not my fav style). This will probably be in my cellar again before too long."
"Pours a dark garnet/mahogany red, typical for a Belgian Dark, with nary a head, just a wispy off-white coating. Smell is ULTRA-fruity, Hawaiian Punch on steroids. Taste is intense sweet fruit, Belgian olivey-ness, and alcohol. Some might think it's a little cloying, but I didn't mind the sweetness. Like a cross between Nostradamus and Unibroue Trois Pistoles...which is a good thing. Better than Nos. not quite as good as T-P. Mouthfeel smooth and crisp. A very solid brew here, strong, but drinkable....just be careful at 8.5%. And it has a cool Fantasia-esque pink elephant on it's speckled white bottle. Can't beat that."
"Compared to the flavor of most good dubbels, but the strength of a trippel or a quad. Good sugary flavor, similar to brown sugar, figs, and grapes. Never becomes wine like or cider like. Strong malt aromas-all barley and candy. Underlying sweetness of honey and pepery spices. Full bodies, just shy of syrupy or sticky. Finsihes sweet without cloying. has all of the sweet alcohol flavors and heat. No phenols...suprisingly smooth and easily drank."
"Pours a slightly cloudy, dark brown color with ever so slight ruby highlites with 2 fingers of light tan head that falls to just under a finger. Nose is nice ans sweet and spicey. I get good notes of brown sugary sweetness, slightly fruity. Not sure what spices I get, but its sure spicey. Flavor is not as sweet as the nose. I get a bit of peppery spice and sourness that is a bit unexpected from the nose. Its very tasty. I would like just a touch more brown sugary sweetness in the flavor. The feel is moderate to thick with a nice moderate carbonation of small, tight bubbles. Overall, a very nice brew. No hint of the alcohol. I like it."
"D- This beer has a nice full malt palate with some nice bitterness to balance. Enjoyably complex with a nice little punch."
"I find this beer to be quite drinkable, as I had very little trouble finishing the whole 750, although I took my time doing so. The 8.5% alcohol is intense if you're not used to it, so don't plan on drinking too many of these, but this is a perfect beer to have with a nice meal, and is among the first on my list of ""beers I wish I could get at a nice restaurant""."
"overall: not too bad. not great either. definitely a brew to try, but in my opinion, there are much better beers to have for $5 a bottle. i paired some ny cheddar with this beer. it helped bring out the flavors and i definitely didn't notice the wet paper 'till after having some cheese. that's just a suggestion."
"Pours a deep murky brown with a huge rocky beige head that settles down to a solid half inch cap that sticks around the whole time. Aroma is green apples, brown sugar, raisins, and oak--very nice. Taste is rich and sweet---prunes, raisins, molasses, cocoa, and a definite alcohol presence. Finish is spicey and peppery, just a hint of hops bitterness as well. Mouthfeel is full-bodied and creamy. Overall this is a good Belgian ale, and I think I actually prefer this to the Tremens."
"Pours a dark brown/ruby with a small diminshing tan head. Little retention with very little lacing to match it. The aroma reminded me of apples. Slightly spicy as well. I would give this beer higher marks for smell, but the presence of alcohol can definitely be noticed as it warms. Just not as pleasant as apples, sorry. Nice, long-lasting sweet flavor. Slightly fruity, slightly spicy, slightly sweet. Nice mix of flavors and fairly complex. Medium bodied with a nice finish. Pretty drinkable for an 8.5% beer. An enjoyable brew by all means."
"The beer is very well crafted and without the anice I would really dig it. If you dont mind that flavor and like dark belgians this is one hell of a brew for you!"
"Drinkability: Oh hell, yes! You would do yourself a disservice not to try this one, it's good."
"cheers."
"I think this is a very drinkable beer and I would highly recommend it to anyone. I hope I am able to get some more of these in the future."
"Mouthfeel is very bubbly, medium-bodied, very refreshing. Quite drinkable. Overall, a very tasty concoction."
"Dark, mostly opaque brown color, with a large initial (and quite airy) head. Nose is oddly weak, just a slight fruitiness and caramel maltiness. Taste is very fruity, full of flavors of caramalized grape, sweet and luscious, with a strong dose of dark molasses-like malt. Phenols and pepper alcohol notes offset the sweetness more than hop bitterness, which is present but way in the background. Finishes with a herbal dryness. Full-bodied with a smooth texture."
"Spiffy stuff!"
"Mildly alcoholic with a creamy medium body. Mouthfeel highly altered by fountain of CO2. Clean dry finish with a brief crisp after taste. Very drinkable."
"An extremely interesting ale. I think that some of the other reviewers must have gotten a bad bottle. Pours a beautiful red-brown with ruby glints, off-white head is large and thick. Aroma is immediately of dark, sweet fruits, with a sour citrus tang and an underpinning of yeast in the nose. Taste is delicious, with sweet, dark plum and red grape clashing with sour grapefruit and green apple, underwritten by earthy, nutty yeast flavor. Very smooth and peppery in the mouth, with a bit of phenolic butteryness. Alcohol content becomes a bit more evident as the ale warms. A unique and interesting Belgian dark."
"Drinkability and Overall: It's an odd beer that's for sure. The flavor is really wild, but not too incredibly enjoyable. I'll give it points for being unique, but that doesn't make it great. Not bad."
"Drinkability- I HOPE I got a bad bottle here. I love the Noel and the Delirium is very good also. Hmmm, dare I retry this again sometime down the road?"
"What a dissapointment. The pours a think brown with simply too much head. I appreciate a healthy head, but I also like being able to get some beer in the glass. The flavor was very one dimenional. It tasted strongly of brown sugar and that's about it. The mouthfeel was really thin. It was pretty easy to drink, but that's not what I was looking for."
"Reflection: This is a must try, but I couldn't make a session out of it."
"A dark Belgian that is all around good for the palate."
"Overall, a good beer. There are definately better beers out there, but this is still quite good. I think a few months in the cellar would help this beer mellow a bit."
"Smooth, nice dark appearance with beige head. Great to find these on tap, as I did at Underground Bluz in Orlando. A dark conglomeration as Sweet side fruity with sour and malty aftertaste, disguised high alcohol, thin -Medium mouthfeel. Works with food."
"($7.19 / 750 ml / 25.6 oz corked and caged white ""ceramic"" champagne style bottle with royal blue foil)"
"½-inch head of heavy cream with a slight mocha tint. Deep, dark cider brown hue that lets in no light. Fig, cardamom, rich malt tones on nose. Cantankerous syrup malt with a chocolatey trailing swirl; touches of blackberry; kind of a vacuous felt lining and wooly side-trail. In a way, this offering hits you over the head"
"Finish was surprisingly refreshing for a beer of this gravity. DN left me with a silky, highly drinkable finish. This fares well among the holiday offering I sampled recently."
"Nice smoke and dry woody palate players drumming along on this wicked jammy roller coaster. Layers of thick fruit jams stuck to the bottom of the pan; apple butter cooked thick and sticky in a cast iron kettle. The alcohol kicks the dark malts into blackstrap molasses. Overall, it tastes like fruit cake with some dark toasted walnuts and filberts, and maybe some chestnuts. Alcohol all over. A bit rough, a bit sweet."
"bought this one for the bottle. my daughter like elephants.poured a deep amber with light tan tall frothy head.aroma yeast,dark fruits, raisin.flavor a little sweetness and a hint of orange and some maybe plum. mouth feel watery with a bit of bitterness. a enjoyable beer."
"This is a pretty good Beer. It's not up there with St. Bernardus Abt. 12 (my personal favorite), but it's still pretty good. Not a bad one to pick up when looking for a decent Belgian."
"The taste is very good, moderately warming with a convergance of fruity flavors and spicy character followed by a yeasty finish. The alcohol is evident but not overpowering."
"This is a fantastic looking beer with dark reddish brown color and a very impressive fluffy light brown head which holds very well and leaves heavy lacing. The aroma is also great with notes of chocolate malt and yeasty fruit. The flavors are delivered with a nice medium bodied, creamy mouthfeel. Flavors of dark fruit and mocha like malt dominate. Overall one of the better belgian ales that I have had and definately one of the best looking beers that I have seen when poured into the proper glass. This is one is a must try for fans of Belgian beers."
"Taste is lightly sour up front, with a wonderful roasted/burnt malt flavor rising to the surface. Hints of sherry and light flavors of bitter chocolate. Spicy, like pepper and nutmeg, maybe hints of ginger. all these flavors intertwine nicely. Mouth is rich and chewy. Mmmmm...beer. This is really nice. Tried both this and the Delirium Tremens tonight but this one takes the cake. Gotta get some more."
"Pours a slightly cloudy deep ruby brown. Forms a nice tan head initially, but quickly subsides into pools of surface lace and light lacing on the sides of the glass. Predominantly sweet & candy-like nose with spicy alcohol underpinnings. Flavor starts with candied fruits, develops into a restrained toasted malt middle, and finishes extremely dry. Body is creamy and nicely carbonated, if perhaps a little bit too light for the style."
"Sampled a small bottle, no freshness dating to be found. Pours a dark, rudy cloudy brown, topped by a frothy tan head with excellent retention. Leaves some lacing ,but not alot. Nose is of sweet musty spoiled fruit. Big flavors abound here, mostly dark candy sugar, raisins, figs, chocolate, farmy, musty stuff. Rich, flavorful and warming. A style that can take some getting used to, but this is a pleasant, drinkable, if not spectacular take."
"The beer pours a very dark brown/black color with a thick frothy tan head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is decent. It has a very dry malty scent that boasts of pale, crystal, and roasted malts. It has a slight musty aroma along with some yeast fruitiness. The taste is good. It has a smooth malty flavor that boasts of many crystal malts; very complex. It goes down easy and finishes creamy and with some yeast fruitiness. It is a bit warm on the way down; very dry. The mouthfeel is good. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a fine Belgian dark. It has good flavor and is extremely smooth; a good drinker."
"Mouthfeel is not heavy but not a pushover, either. Carbonation maintains a bite and the aftertaste is dry and clean. Rates just a hair below its lighter cousin (Tremens), but not by much."
"75 cl bottle. Cork dated 2004. Pours a hazed deep chocolate brown with a fluffy beige. Aromas of sweet plummy malt, tree bark, meadow and musty yeast. Sweet, malty, yeasty, grapey in its fruitiness, with a medium body and mouthfeel. Moderately carbonated. Light astringency in the finish. Alcohol punch noticable. It tastes a little thinner than what I remembered. Nonetheless, it's a very good beer that's easy to enjoy."
"Not a bad beer at all, I was expecting more because of how much I enjoyed the Pale from the same brewery. It just doesnt make its mark when compared to some other beers Ive had of the style."
"Pours a solid brown, making the rounded bottom of the glass look like a brown bowling ball. Nice head quickly settles down to near nothingness. Smells fruity and of alcohol. Tastes like apples and chocolate with a very smooth mouthfeel. Very tasty and easy to drink."
"The beer pours a nice deep red almost brown, which is a good suprise I was expecting a much lighter belgian for this beer. Guess I should have figured nocturnum=night=dark but I just didnt think that far ahead. The beer is rather carbonated the cork popped out with ease and could have gone a fair distance. The carbonation gives a very interesting mouthfeel. It almost tingles your tongue and has a nice bite to the sips. The flavor profile is nice and malty without being thick. The beer is lacking in the phenolic nastiness that exists in many belgian style beers. There is no mediciny taste at all. All in all a rather nice beer, ive yet to be disappointed by the pink elephants."
"Pours out a dark brown/garnet with some head but goes away into lacing around the glass. Smell consisted of dark fruits, a little bit sugary at times, and some toffee notes in the background. Taste was pretty good. Malty, fruity, a little on the sweet side and finishes with some grapes and toffee like flavors. Alcohol is not really noticeable, warms the throat really. Medium body and not overcarbonated which let the flavors really come through. Not bad at all, worth a try for sure, but I rather pick up some Unibroue instead for the price."
"Drinkability/Overall: Not as brutal as Tremens, quite easy to drink. Not my favorite belgain, but still a pleasure to drink."
"Huge off white head, on top of a brown body. It has a faint roasted malt smell. It has a spicy bite, and the alcohol is present all the way through as well as a little bitterness mixed in with the roasted malt flavor. In the after taste there is some chocolate and coffee. Nocturnum is inline with the other delirium offerings, this happens to be the dark version. Solid beer, worth a try."
"All and all a very drinkable and refreshing beer. I'm very glad I got this one. It's the first one I've had where the cool package is backed up with a great beer. Don't pass this one up it's worth the time."
"I've had stronger beers than this that do a much better job subduing the alcohol and allowing other flavors to shine through. This might compliment red meat and cheese dishes well, but taken on it's own it's a little much."
"I wonder how old this bottle was...My guess is at least a few years. This Beer was still good, but the taste I got from it doesn't seem to concur with everyone else."
"Drinkability: A fine sipping strong Belgian; surprisingly, over time, the sour flavors really take over"
"I really enjoy this brewery. Poured a dark amber color with a bubbly head that rose fast. Smells of malts and spices, little hops aroma. It goes down smooth even though it has a 8.5%abv. I do enjoy this beer alot and would recommend to anyone who like Belgian strong ales."
"This is not like any other beer I've had before. My first Belgian. Poured orange/amber/ruby with a foamy head that quickly disappeared. Smelled of spices, sweetness, malts, and maybe some alcohol but I'm not sure. Tastes almost like apple cider with some kick to me. It does have some malts but kind of a sweet aftertaste. This seems like a beer with an identity crisis. Does it want to be sweet? hoppy? malty? what? Not bad but just not sure about this one. Maybe as I try other Belgians my taste buds will sharpen. Definitely worth a try just to get another style."
"Dark tea colour with dirty white head sets this beer up to be approached with sipping on the mind. The nose is not huge but has alcohol notes and old esters. The taste is graveyard dirt and iron which gives this beer a nice brown ale taste much like Nostradamus or Rochefort. I like this beer though it isn't at the same level as other dark heavy Belgian classics. Well worth buying though."
"D&N: An ok beer. If it were a bit less fizzy I might like it more, but the pink elephant can't save this one."
"330ml white coating on a brown bottle. Very noticible, you've probably seen it. Weird drawings on the label. Pours a dark brown with just a little red. small head with good staying power and good lacing on the glass. First its malty and almost sweet. A lot of flavors going on but not really any bitterness or hopiness. You can definitely taste that this is a stronger beer, 8.5%. As you swallow the flavor changes and leaves this odd taste, a very complex beer."
"Strange beer. Not bad, but a little too ""out there"" for me to hit it regulary."
"750 ml bottle, with a 2001 cork. As long as the cork indicates the year, this is a jackpot, for there are lots left, and this seems to be well mellowed. Pours a clear brown with a big fluffy tan head. The carbonation is on the lower end for a Belgian, which may also be a proof of age. Aroma is complex with a strong fig component, and a mix of vanilla and raisin. Palate is warming, with the alcohol apparent, but blended well with the beer's flavor and aroma. Flavor is very fruity, with raisin and fig evident. A little sticky and full bodied as well. I remember having a bottle a little over a year ago from the same store and it not being nearly as good, so aging helps a plenty..."
"Almost opaque dark brown color. Rocky tannish head with good lace adhesion on the glass. Spare chocolate to the aroma, light rum, yeasty funkiness. Mouthfeel is medium and spritzy with secondary carbonation. Bright flavors of fruit, grape and unripe nectarines, some lemony qualities. A dry cocoa lingers in the background and adds some balance. Finish is astringent with the carbonation showing its best effect. All-in-all, could use some more malt tones to match the mouthfeel better, a good enough brew but not seminal to my tastes."
"Enjoying this, very much."
"Dark mahogany/brown with off-white head and very yeasty smells that are followed by sweet smelling fruits. The fragrance is almost overwhelming. Strong tastes of aged malts and a yeasty hit of sweet fruits and spices. Bits alcohol hit the palate and after a couple sips you can feel it almost overtake you. Very delicious brew that finishes with bits of plums and spice. The alcohol in this brew really warms the stomach and sends you off to a happy land. Or maybe that was just me. Really something to try if you get the chance. This hits almost every part of the palate."
"Very drinkable, but why pay so much for this when you can get a more complex brew locally from Concorde?"
"A fun beer to try, but not something I would make a regular drink. I haven't seen this one at local shops in the U.S.; for the money, I'd go with Delirium Tremens or another Belgian over the Nocturnum."
"All in all, an excellent effort. This is just a beautiful beer that hits all of the right buttons. If you're not already pursuing Belgian and Belgian styled domestic beers, I wholeheartedly recommend that you do so. There was a lot of adventure in this little 11.2 oz. bottle. That little pink elephant is smiling for a reason..."
"Very good Drinkability, but this is the stuff you sip and don't chug!"
"Very sour beer. A bit of smoke and malt, but mostly sourness. Not a terrible brew if you're into that kind of thing, but I'm not. Shame it couldn't be like it's brother Tremens. Painted bottle looks nice, maybe this was just a bad bottle?"
"Pours a deep red with a brownish tint with a pretty large head,aroma was like bubblegum and spicey.Taste is chocolaty and spicey with some light fruity notes.Seemed a little thin but the drinkability for me on this one was great.Went very with a stuffed quail dish and a sauce reduction of the beer."
"Drinkability is superior but powerful alcohol and flavor would make hard to session."
"Opened a nice 750 ml bomber on a Sunday night before my dinner guests arrived and I must say, I was not disappointed. The appearance was as close to perfection as it gets. Dark red/brown with a stupendous tan head that just would not back down. Even when it did, it left a beautiful lacing that is second to none. The smell was to me quite alcohol like and filled with fruits and grains. The taste was like the smell. Upfront it was yeasty and bready with a nice dose of dark fruits although I have to say, not quite as nice as an abt 12 of any sort. Also a mild hoppiness could be found, yet it played second fiddle to the fruits and sweet malts. Mouthfeel was good, although a bit too carbonated for my taste. But the body itself was creamy and satisfying. Drinkability must have been excellent, because I drank the whole darn bomber myself, hehe. If you are a fan of dark ales, give this a go."
"The taste left me wondering if I had the right beer. Light sweetness with a spicy middle and a dry biting finish. Sounds ok? Not really. It is surprisingly one-dimensional: The flavor seems to have some interesting characteristics but it does not appear to pull it off."
"After taking whiff, I was anxious for a taste. Nocturnum really lacks any real personality in its' flavor. Everything was very subdued. No raisin, no rum, no spice. Just a bit of sweet maltiness and a mild case of the ""typical"" Belgian flavor. I was hoping for something on par with Unibroue's Trois Pistoles. It's not a terrible brew, but for being rather exspensive it bores me."
"Poured into a tulip glass, large brownish head with resiliency, which leaves heavy lace. Gorgeous translucent maroon color when held up to a light, with an aroma dominated by raisins. Taste is okay, but not quite as malty as I would hope, and dominated by the raisin flavor, which in my opinion has become overpowering of all other constituents of this brew. That flavor domination also affects the mouthfeel and drinkability of this Belgian, which is acceptable, but pales in comparison to some others in its class."
"Tasting it as I write this. Warm, dark caramel brown. Nice carbonation, small but tenacious head. Smell is malty sweet, a little raisiny as well. Taste is a bit tangy, almost citrusy at times, with a hint of orange zest in there. Mouthfeel is pleasant to say the least, and it is quite drinkable. I like Tremens quite a bit, and its sibiling is just as enjoyable. Recommended"
"Thin to medium bodied and highly carbonated. The alcohol aftertaste, in conjunction with the heavy carbonation, hurt the drinkibility."
"11.2 oz bottle, capped not corked. Pours into a goblet a dark chestnut brown with ruby highlights. One cm beige head of tightly knit tiny bubbles. Aroma of marshmallows, bananas, cloves, and freshly ground black pepper. Mouthfeel is very carbonated with a peppery bite. Taste is of bubble gum and freshly baked bread, with fruitiness and slight yeasty mustiness. A medicinal alcohol punch becomes apparent as it approaches room temperature. It becomes very vinous and sherry-like toward the finish, which I didn't care for. Overall, my least favorite Delirium, but not at all bad."
"Drinkability is okay beings that it is 8.5% and it tastes like straw."
"This Belgian Ale is one of my favorites. It has a nice aroma of berries and earth. As with others, it was the packaging that first caught my eye. But the product inside is just as exciting as the design on the bottle. Lots of bubbles that texture the mouth which helps the aroma permeate as you drink, creating a full sensory experience."
"I was initially attracted to the very cool bottle, and the beer was just as good. Pours a medium brown hue with a white head. Grape kinda aroma, with a full bodied malty flavor with yeasty grapey kind of flavors. I really love this beer. It is definately underrated."
"Nice caramel, wine-like color with a great head that stayed at about 1/4 inch. Sweet smell (a hint of cherry?). Alcohol aroma was also evident, almost a light brandy aroma. Taste was initially sweet and ended ina pleasant, dry alcohol presence. For the abv, a medium mouthfeel was quite nice, with the resultant drinkability being very good, with a smooth quality. A good brew that is definitely worth trying."
"Not a bad double from Delirium. Though I come for the Pink Elephants, I stay for a good-if-not-spectacular beer. Quite good, and one I'll have again, especially with its nice, widespread distribution."
"Whoa! This one totally kicked my ass! It was much better than I had expected. It had many different tastes at once and the tastes changed. It was like some sort of morph beer or something. When it was colder it was kind of ""eh", nothing spectacular, but still a damn good beer. As it warmed up, the different tastes of fruits, malts, and a coffee taste reared their heads. This brew was one of the most smoothest brews I have had to date. It was clean, refreshing, and bold. Characteristics that are key in a good brew for me."
"Dry with a medium body and very warming, drinkability is good, but like the name alludes to this might put you to sleep."
"Poured a dark red brown, had a nice head although nowhere near as exhuberant as Tremens, very light fruit spice malt aroma. Had the taste of fruit and malt, reminded me of blackberries. A little more timid than I thought,sweet fruity, but not enoughof either"
"Overall Impression: I like it more than the first time I reviewed it, but I still think there are better Belgians to hunt. Still a good pink elephant."
"The feel is full with a nice lingering fullness in the finish. Limited drinkability due to the fullness and high alcohol content."
"750mL bottle poured into a tulip-style glass. It pours a deep brown, almost black color with 3 fingers of fluffy head. There is a large amount of lacing left on the glass. The smell hints at coffee and spice aromas, fairly sweet. The taste also has coffee notes, weird for a Belgian. A little fruity as well, with bits of dates and raisins. Very malty with no hops present. The body is fairly thick and heavy. The drinkability is fairly nice for an 8.5% brew. A decent Belgian."
"This had a huge head with a good red brown body. The aroma is lightly sweet with a light citrus character. The flavor is a little bit of a letdown though, without a huge amount of character. In the end, it just seems to be a pretty run of the mill Belgian strong ale."
"First of I have to say that it does have a cool looking bottle. I saw Gordon Eliot go to Belgium and visit the brewery and up into that point in my life I had never had a Belgium beer. So I had to check it out. This beer poured a dark brownish red color into my Delirium glass. It appeared that the Pink Elephants were dancing as the thick tan head rose in the glass. The smell of this beer is from the heavens with smells of plums, raisons and malts. The taste is full of great carbonation, sweat caramel and fruity earth tones. It has a very port like feel to it. In my opinion it is a very good Belgium."
"Overall Impression: I'm not sure which one I favor more, Tremens of Nocturnum. They're both fantastic. This one just goes down so easy! The tartness even makes it somewhat refreshing. That's not an easy task for an 8.5% beer!"
"Drinkability  This one lacks the smoothness of a fine, mature, BSDA. Most all the ingredients seem to be there, they just need an experienced hand in getting them all together."
"Beer pours with a nice, bubbly head rounded above the rim of the glass and diminishes rather quickly to a rocky top, then to a thick lace. Nice dark mahogany brown that is somewhat cloudy. A bit tough to see through the darkness, yet some bubbles can be seen cascading to the surface from the bottom of the glass. The aroma is sweet maltiness and fruity with some banana and slight hops. Theres a smooth start in which fruity notes are apparent along with some yeast flavor. Cloves and other spices come in towards the end. Theres a fluffy mouthfeel due to the carbonation, and alcohol comes in mid swallow to lend a little bite to the earlier smoothness. Lightly bitter citrus notes make up the aftertaste which lingers for a period."
"Drinkability: This struck me as a great all around beer, as an aperatif, digestif, or with food even."
"Pours with a two finger, light tan head that leaves no lace. Pour this VERY slowly. Cloudy amber color. Malty/alcohol nose. Carbonation is heavy. Full bodied. Starts sweet and malty, finish sweet and malty with the hops lurking in the background. Fizzy mouthfeel. The ABV on the label is 9.0%. Another excellent Belgium."
"Ah, the pink elephants. This was the last of the ""Delirium"" series for me, having had their Tremens on tap innumerable times, and thie Noel in a bottle last Christmas. I'm not sure why I put this one off so long, and the pour made me wonder even more strongly. A lovely dark ruby in color topped by a fairly large light tan head with a smooth, creamy consistency. Ah, the pink elephants. This was the last of the ""Delirium"" series for me, having had their Tremens on tap innumerable times, and thie Noel in a bottle last Christmas. I'm not sure why I put this one off so long, and the pour made me wonder even more strongly. A lovely dark ruby in color topped by a fairly large light tan head with a smooth, creamy consistency. The aroma starts off strongly dominated by malt, with a slightly toasty overtone and some mild spices (reminded me of cinnamon and coriander) in the background. The malt and spice aromas seemed to drop off as the beer sat, replaced by a fairly strong tart aroma. Odd. Flavor hits big, sweet, and with more toasty malt. Very creamy mouthfeel, with a slightly burnt and bitter finish, followed by a bit of tartness in the aftertaste. A very good Belgian dark, to be sure, but not one which has many especially memorable qualities."
"Dark ruby-mahogany hue, active and talkative light beige head, at least two fingers worth at the apex, excellent retention (long lasting fluff), minimal lace. The nose is slightly peppery underneath notes of grapes and candy, hints of alcohol and toffee decent potency, inviting. Admirable palate, distant grapes hints of toffee, pepper, and alcohol. Its complex but nothing really propels the beer, tasty and damn good but it lacks some of the idiosyncrasies found in other Belgium beers. The finish is bone freaking dry wow! The carbonation is cleansing, and moderately high. Medium-light body, thinner in spots. The aftertaste is grapes. The alcohol has a noticeable affect on the mind. This is a very good Belgium beer, not great but very much worth trying."
"This is such a well balanced beer. I found the finish to be a little odd and almost too tart, but beyond that... just waves of flavor. Easily one of the better belgians out there. In my notes I wrote ""great fucking beer!!"". I guess I liked it. :-)"
"Very cool bottle! This beer pours a chestnut (brown/red) color with a small head and a little lacing on the glass. The aroma was sweet with some pepper spice and hints of alcohol. The flavor of this one is my favorite of the Delirium line. It was pretty smooth to drink. The flavor was a mix of fruits, pepper, nuts, and a lot of other things I can't figure out. The abv is slightly apparent in the taste, but it is not bad at all."
"Very dark brown color, medium head. Aroma is fruity and sweet. Intense malt flavor, slight sugar-candy sweetness, touch of bubble gum. Slightly spicy hops, but malts predominate. Mouthfeel is very full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is malty."
"Poured a mohagany brown color with little head that soon left only lacing on the glass. The aroma was of sweet maltiness mixed with a peppery spice. The taste however seemed to let me down a little. Very raisiny combined with a spice that wasn't peppery but more of an alcoholic spice. Dark vinous fruits mixed in the middle. Finishes with more of that spicy alcohol flavor. The flavors never seem to mesh well in this one. It still is a quality brew just not as good as tremens."
"what a bottle, it's gorgeous and looks like a scary kind of fun. that elephant is going to chase me isn't it? a wowzer of a light brown and pink head is tall over a dark cranberry colored body. the head has been companion for the whole ride and leaves a considerable amout of lace on the glass, diffrent than what i just read from other reviewers but what the heck. aromas abound and are very impressive. caramel, oranges, apples, cotton candy, molasses and spring air all come to me. now the flavor i'm going to try to nail down but one bottle of this and it's like i'm trying to describe why i like sex, i end up hot again...never enough my friends, never enough. roasted toasted hop feel like a sparkler (i think this beer makes hallucinations). heavy dark complex and sturdy mouthfeel can support all the coffee, fudge, bitter beechnut/hazelnut, ginger, cinnamon, rasin and dried fruit, licorice and like a burnt nectarine tea, it's dark and complex and has an opium flavor (like the insence!) did i mention that this stuff seems to get me high? it's got a revealing warmth to it, yes there's alcohol in it. it's lush and full on all fronts and is just a heavenly experience!"
"When this beer was poured it contained medium-large sized bubbles. There was no lacing on the sides of my glass. This beer had a strong nose to it and I could definitely taste the alcohol. However, I did not find this beer to be all that interesting to me. Not a beer that I would drink all night that's for sure. It does however have a nice bottle to display in our bar!"
"This is another highly carbonated brew. Upon pouring it it immediately started to overflow my glass causing be to sip the foam fast! The head was filled with medium to large light brown bubbles. Its aroma was very pleasant and strong smelling. Its body is a almost non-transparent brown color. The head died quickly before I could take my first sip. There was almost no lacing on the side of the glass. A thick sweet taste filled with ..., god I wish I was better with tastes and smells. I cant place it. I can taste the alcohol content in it. It is very strong. The palate is fine, but middle of the road. I am still looking for a brew to drink tonight!"
"Pour is a dark opaque brown with a large tan head, minimal lacing. Aroma is big and fruity, vinous, lot's of grapes, some chocolate. Flavor is strong with chocolate and fruits, and some spiciness shows as well. Medium body, a little thinner feeling than the Tremens was."
"Appears a deep ruby brown very dark tone to it with a moccha colored head sitting on top, and there is basically no lace present on the edges of my glass. Aroma consists of a sharp sweetness with tingling hints of faint fruit notes all topped with the characteristic alcoholic nose of a Belgium dark strong ale. So far this beer is basically Tremens with some slightly burnt specialty malts, but the flavor just doesn't put it alltogether to me there is something lacking in this beer. Also the alcohol comes through in the flavor pretty strongly, a nice kick to the brew with the bite of alchol it delivers to the palate. Mouthfeel is medium with full heavy carbonation just a little too thin in body, but I would imagine in the bottle conditioning this beer would be fuller from the yeast. Drinkability well high abv is a strike against it, not overly complex, but this is not something I could drink regularly as a go to. It just doesn't do it for me."
"I enjoyed the Tremens so well that I decided to try the dark. If packaging counted towards appearance I'd give it an extra half point for the beautiful painted bottle and colorful foil label. Poured dark browm with a small tan head which didn't lace the glass at all. None the less, a great tasting and very smooth ale. Exceptionally drinkable giving it's high alcohol content. Just as good as the Tremens in my opinion."
"Appropriately noctural (let's call it just after sunset) color scheme--hazy dark amber with crimson at the fringe. An impressive, bubbly head that lasts as long as any I've poured and is fed by an impressive eruption of carbonation. Fine lace clings to remind you of the progress you have made--as if the alcohol content alone couldn't do that. Smell is somewhat medicinal (presumably the alcohol) with spice present as well. Creamy mouthful of malty sweetness starts the drink and then gives way to green apple tartness which fades back to malt that gradually and subtly dries. Wait a bit and alcohol warmth becomes the most notable feature. More drinkable than I expected such a strong beer to be; goes down very well."
"I noticed that as this beer warmed, the fruit esters diminished, as did the yeast notes. I was left with a potent malty beverage with only hints of the fruitiness and yeast overtones that the slightly colder glass brought forth."
"Pours a dark but clear garnet color with a light tan large bubbled head. The aromas of light sweet fruit and raisons, light yeast, and alcohol smell delicious! The taste is a lightly sweetened fruit and raisons again with very light hopping and a warming alcohol. It is a bit to light bodied, as the thin mouthfeel doesnt stick around quite long enough. It has a delicious flavor but as Ive stated, it is simply too thin. I liked this brew, but all the pieces are not there. Op uw gezonheid!"
"This beer pours a slightly hazy brown/red with a large tan to brown head. The mouthfeel while not thin is a bit less viscous than I expected. The smell is oaky maltiness with an herbal quality. The taste is smooth maltiness with a mild peppery alcohol and a mild herbal hoppiness. Overall a deceptively high alcohol beer that shows just a hint of its power in the finish."
"Dangerous and fruity with the high alcohol level. It was very smooth and actuaklly a bit thin from the bottled version but still sweet and delicious. Hints of apple or other fruit in the aftertaste as this is a sipping beer to be enjoyed slowly. Let it warm as the changes become more apparent when this is allowed."
"Smell is sweet candy, spice, fruit. It's very strong smelling. Very nice. The front is very sweet, with spice, grapes, bananas. The middle is dark caramel and earthy, with alcohol peeking through. The finish is dry, with a sour alcoholish taste. Also, bubblegum, pepper, hints of chocolate. Overall I really like this beer. The only thing wrong with it for me is that the alcohol is not all that well hidden, and leaves a sourish aftertaste. I should drink this with an after-dinner platter of fruit, cheese and chocolate."
" One of my favorites to drink alone for a most memorable solitary indulgence."
"(source: PremierGourmet; Buffalo, NY)"
"Drinkability: Good. A potent, warming beer. Very nice to relax with at the end of the day."
"maybe this got shaken up? Head is huge!! Tiny bubbles make up a massive frothy head. This beer pours a cloudy dary amber, almost ruby.. Smells strong of sour fruit, mainly apples. You can smell yeast in this one!! Very fruity taste with a mild alcohol kick. Some butterscoth detected in the aftertaste, some spicy flavors. Goes down with a metallic kick. This beer lets you know what you're getting into right away. Overall nice dark belgian ale"
"Lovely, though brief, white head, deep, dark violet color. A sweet bouquet greets you in the nose, full of spices and fruit. Which ones? The kind that moon men pick on Venus, that's what kind! Very vinous, with berries, cherries, melons, grapes, and more. A remarkable flavor profile. If a cantelope mated with a bing cherry, it might approximate this flavor. Highly hopped, marvelously carbonated, great malt spine on it. And full, full, full of flavor! Bold, confident, assertive, it knows what it is, and don't care what no one thinks. One of the best of the best, I unashamedly assert."
"note: this was served a bit too cold, but when warmed up it's a real charmer!"
"Huyghe make the best and worst of beers in my opinion. The Delirium range contains most of their better offerings and for the price, it is always worth having a bottle or two of this stuff in your fridge, cool store, cellar, mouth, or stomach."
"Highly carbonated brew nearly blows off the cap, and forms a rocky meringue tan peak of medium sized bubbles atop a very clear ruby-dark amber liquid. Aroma is that of Jack Daniel's whiskey, wine, and bavarian wheat yeast. The mixture of aromas is not too pleasant. One can tell this has a lot of kick without reading the bottle which tells you its 8.5% abv. Taste starts out with a cloying, sugary sweetness and is quickly disturbed by a very strong metallic bite, as if drinking Newcastle Brown Ale whilst sucking on pennies and quarters. Ends with phenols and dank, musty cardboard, leaving an unpleasant coating on the tongue. This is where you say ""Ugh."" Certainly not an enjoyable brew. I had much higher expectations considering the ratings here, and hey, it's Belgian:) My worst homebrew wasn't even this bad. Poured 1/2 the beer down the sink. Definitely would not buy this again."
"Deep dark reddish-brown in color, decent off white small bubbly head. Fruity aroma kind of wine like. Fruity sweetness flavors of apples and grapes, light hops in the finish, still very sweet, light-medium body, this one smells better than it tastes."
"Deep dark and handsome is the pour, the head is commodious, frothy consistency, and the lace clings nicely to the glass. The first snaffle is malt, bubble gummy, fruity, sweet and sniffable. The beer commences with a lightly sweet malt taste, the top is squinny, the finish is moderately carbonated, delicately hopped, long lasting and very dry aftertaste, quite a drinkable beer."
"Cheers"
"750ml corked bottle. Poured a muddy, opaque brown color with a thick, finely bubbled creamy head. Smell was mellow, but inviting with a faint fruity smell of dates maybe? The head dwindled down to a fine, creamy skim of foam that left a trail down the side of the glass. A bit of spiciness in the taste, but nicely balanced. Tastes of raisins, currants, dates - a lingering finish. I really enjoyed this beer and thought it was rather delicious."
"I was quite suprised when I tasted this! Kind of like a Belgian milk stout? I smelled and tasted the chocolate immediately. Head completely disappeared, no lace. Somewhat sweet, but not as much as, say, a Mackeson. Very smooth, nice to drink. A dramatic difference from ""tremens"". Nothing in common, but the bottle and name. Good, but I won't go out of my way for it. Not as good as a great stout or a great dark Belgian Ale (such as Chimay or Rochefort). Certainly worth trying, though."
"Muddy water colored body. Foamy, fluffy, creamy beige head. Smell was somewhat belgian. Very faint spices. Not alot fruit, roasted plums or anything else to notice. Mostly a neutral yeast smell. Taste is along the same lines, basic, yet good yeasty belgian character. Lacks robust flavors of it's brothers Noel, and Tremens. I may have kept it too long before drinking. Medium to full bodied, and very appealing, just lacks the knockout flavors to make it great."
"This beer poured a very dark amber color and formed a light tan head that subsided quickly but left cirular lace. An aroma of malt, caramel and spices with a slight hint of the alcohol present. A flavor of malt and spices. The finish is a touch astrigent. I don't find the flavor of this one to live up as well to other belgians I have tried, but it is a good beer."
"Ruby-Brown in color. Pours out in a loud rush of carbonation that settles to a thick, creamy, tan head. I noticed the alcoholic smell immediately, along with a spicy, fruity, apple-like aroma. It is very rich, and complex in flavor. It has a candi sugar sweetness, and apple-like flavors. It was surprisingly light in body, smooth, and warming, with an abrupt dry finish. This was my first step into the world of Belgian Ales, and it was a rather pleasant one."
"Pours a dark copper color with a thick and foamy off-white head. Very aromatic with scents of tart apple cider, sweet caramel, and spice. Smooth and creamy in the mouth with flavors of candied fruit, sweet malts, and a touch of alcohol that leaves a bit of a dry finish. This is quite a complex beer. Just when you think you have the flavor pinned down, it changes on you."
"Pours a dark copper, with a big, fat, bubbly, tan head. Lots of carbonation apparent in the body, which helps keep a nice lace atop the beer. Rich smell of spices and yeast, with an abundance of red grapes (or plums maybe?) and a hint of toffee. Tart grape flavor is strong, with a spice taste, a slight metallic tang, and plenty of alcohol. Toffee flavors become more and more apparent as this brew warms. Oily finish with a slight lingering taste of grapes. Creamy, oily mouthfeel. Overall, one very interesting brew."
"Wow! What a great beer! Pours a dark garnet/ruby... almost black. Strong head retention. Aromas of candied plums and a faint wisp of raisins - not like that of Special B though. Must be from the yeast. Very little hop aroma (as it should be) but enough flavor to cut the sweetness of the malt and sugar. High octane brew at 9% but easily drinkable. Seek this one out!"
"Gorgeous deep brownish red color with tannish head. Sweet in aroma with a faint hint of sugar. Definitely a beer to take your time with. The alcohol is not as predominant as other beers of this high alcohol. Its body is smooth and creamy with little hop bitterness."
"When first poured is all light brown foam in the glass.  Takes a minute before any liquid is noticeable.  Smells quite sweet and candyish, alcoholy.  Clear brownish red color, lightly carbonated.  Quite sweet and almost syrupy, but also spicy like nutmeg and cinnamon.  Surprisingly light body.  The alcohol is not as pronounced as expected.  Overall a decent beer but there are better Belgians for less money."
"(Wait a minute, This is a DSA not a dubbel, right? Point remains)"
"Pours a very deep reddish amber with a small tan head.  My sinuses were kicking in so as far as scent goes I can't tell you, but my wife said it had the aroma of Nyqual.  A very malty fruit taste that seemed to come and go with each sip. Nice feel of bubbles as you drink it and the alcohol was very much in evidence maybe more than any beer i have drank......CHEERS"

"Pretty crappy. looked OK, dark murky brown. But too sugary and sweet and the alcohol shoes too much, no elegance whatsoever, i found it a bit trashy. But i've come to expect it from this brewery."
"The rocky, heterogenously sized bubbly beige head sits atop a dark garnet hued brew w/ excellent clarity if decanted off the sediment.  The aroma is comprised of dominant citrusy fruitness both of a tart, lime - like character and a sweet orange peel note.  As the brew breathes, peppery spice and lightly raisiny, slightly chocolately Special B malt aromas emerge. Surprisingly mellow aromawise.  In flavor, sweetness is of a dark fruit character, with date - like sweetness dominating.  Hints of caramel from the dark candi sugar along with a light cidery note are present as well.  Biscuit malt and a touch of butter surface as the beer breathes, and then become the dominate malt foundation.  Esters are subdued, w/ trace bubblegum present.  As the CO2 dissapates, the body is revealed to be a touch thin.  The initially prickly mouthfeel subsides into a relatively smooth one that doesn't deter from sipping.  Finishes a touch sugary, but otherwise clean and dry.  Nocturnum is surprisingly tame, and lacks some of the quirky intensities that other Dark Strongs have.  That being said, there aren't any flaws, the sweetness is well controlled and the drinkability is thus excellent.  This bottle was farily young-- the cork was imprinted ""2001."""
"Dark brown with a nice tan head.  Fruit and nutty aromas carry over into the flavor profile.  Hints of licorice and other unidentifiable spices show themselves as the beer warms.  Very enjoyable."
"Having earlier tried the Delirium Tremens, and with this having an abv of 8.5%, I expected the alcohol to be a strong flavor element.  I was quite surprised that this was actually quite mellow (in a relative sort of way).  Very smooth, with a typically Belgian sweetness.  Pleasant spice and fruit notes, suggesting coriander, but I could not really put my finger on some of the fruit flavors.  Shared some with a couple of friends who were at the house, one favors Red Dog and the other grew up in Canada and favors Canadian beers.  Both liked the Nocturnum."
"Inviting dark colour with good lacing, big fruity and alcoholic aroma. Smooth and creamy on the palate with a mellow up front sweetness, mild apple like tartness and a mix of medicinal herb, spicy alcohol and slight grain in the dry finish. This is one Belgian that I'll be going back to for sure."
"Notes: Welcome to Belgian beers! Lovely combination of malts and complex tartness. A surprise lurks around every taste bud with this beer. Amazing how such a beer can go from sweet to mildly tart to dry."
"While a touch strong, even though I greatly enjoy Belgians, this is still one great beer.  The aroma leaves a touch to be desired, but it is still one to be tried.  More than two of these and you will more than likely be seeing pink elephants too!"
"And pretty decent, but I prefer Huyghe (delirium's) other stuff."
"Poured with way too much yeast (even when carefully poured).  grape - malt aroma.  Flavor is painfully bitter mixed with belgian yeast flavor.  Dumped it after only a few sips.  unpalatable."
"Complex flavor. Great nose which gives a surprising flavor like you'd get from a German dopplebock. Very drinkable."
"This beer is dark and mysterious, and gives a big thick head in a Duvel glass (as close as I could come to a Delerium glass). One of the most complex beers I've tasted - the nose gives a slightly sour impression like you'd get from a belgian brown ale.  Taste is all over the map: sour, fruity and spiced.  Definitely a beer for a special occasion."
