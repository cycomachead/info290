"Price point- $10.95/750 ML bottle"

"Flavor is a bit dulled, in comparison. Caramel malt dominates. Peach skin, pear, and tart apple accent, but fade to toasted nuts in the lightly dry and fairly hot finish."
"Bought this beer in the discount bin at the corner liquor store. Never heard of it,but how can you pass up Belgian triple. Threw it in the fridge opened it the next day. First thought was.  What the. Lots of stuff suspended in my glass. Tastes great, smells like fresh baked squaw bread. Had to look this one up,going by the label it seems to be a 2004. Glad I got both bottles. I'm hoping the stuff is yeast. Going to try to harvest it,to make a starter.   Cheers"
"Overall I paid 4 bucks for a 750ml bottle so it was worth it. Next time I would strain it through a metal tea strainer."

"O: It's good, but too strange to great. Maybe I got a strange bottle. Would try again, if not soon."

"O: A great celebration drink. I would say it's my favorite of the 3 des Rocs I've tried, but I love them all equally. Highly recommended for Belgian brew fans."

"O: This was the ugliest beer I've ever seen on the first pour, and every pour dispersed the sediment. That alone brought the score down a lot. Other than that, there is a decent balance between fruity sweetness and spices."
"Presentation: Packaged in an eleven point two ounce Euro-style brown glass longneck bottle, served in a New Belgium chalice."

"O: A pretty unimpressive beer overall. Too sweet and boozy and lacking depth and finesse found in the best examples of the style. Not undrinkable, but nowhere near good."
"What the hell is going on with this beer? Please, oh please, let this be a bad bottle. The aroma makes me think this beer had promise somewhere along the way. As is, it's down right bad. The appearance alone has me close to squeamish."

"330ml bottle. Triple Karmeliet tulip glass. Revisited on jul´12. Hazy brown in color. Beige head creates a close, slowly dissipated, crown. Lacing rings on sides. Dark fruit-plums ,raisins & figs-, Belgian yeast, spiced aromas. Malty sweetness at first sip rounded by fruity, yeasty & spiced touches. Medium to full body. Moderate carbonation. Creamy to oily texture & smooth palate where ABV is very well masked. Slightly phenolic in the middle. Sweet ripe fruit finish. Flavorful & delighfull."
"Ov: I'm up and down on this style. I prefer IPAs but I enjoyed this beer. To get a 750ml for $8 made it even more enjoyable. I prefer Chimay and Gulden Draak for their smoothness but this beer did not disappoint. I will get this ale again. I may need to split the bottle next time. You certainly feel the alcohol with this one. Cheers!"
"Hayward Abbey Rating: 95"
"Beer is medium-bodied with carbonation that is initially a bit too high, but calms down over time. The result is a fairly smooth beer, perhaps a bit watery around the edges, and with noticeable ethanol warming on the tongue, throat, and in the nostrils."
"4.0 D: Great beer. This brewery is definitely legit."
""
""

"O: I wish the taste was a bit less one-dimensional with the molasses and this would be even better, though it certainly does not disappoint as is."
"Served from tap into a Trappe Door tulip. Poured a murky light brown with tons of sediment with a two finger khaki colored head that subsided to half a finger very slowly. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, bread, dark fruit, and raisins. The flavor was of sweet malt, bread, dark fruit, raisins, and cream. It had a heavy feel on the palate with medium carbonation which reminded me of a thin milkshake. Overall this was a decent brew. At first this one was a little off-putting due to all of the sediment present in it. Even with all of the sediment present in this glass the flavor and aroma on this one was still quite nice. There was a ton of dark fruit going on here, specifically raisin. This was definitely the factor that made this brew enjoyable. Definitely worth trying with or without the sediment."

"A bit intense for my taste and certainly packs a wallop, which can be a good or bad thing. Definitely needs to sit a bit opened. Nevertheless an enjoyable ""sipping"" beer."
""
"Medium to full bodied with modest carbonation. Has a sweet aftertaste. Not as good as the best Belgian Strong Dark Ales, but still quite good. If this beer had more complexity, and no floaters, it would have been scored higher."
"I poured this into my Chimay glass and observed the color to be a deep chestnut, with plenty of sediment/re-fermented yeast present. A frothy, off-white head appears but dissipates quickly, leaving only a thin covering. The aroma is extraordinary - with spices and many fruity elements, such as green apple, pear, and plum. Flavor - has some tart cherry that I did not detect in the aroma as well as the apple spice. Begins very sweet and has a touch of bitterness in the finish. I am noticing a woody earthiness, that comes off a little chalky to me. I'm taking some points off for this. The beer coats the palate nicely and the alcohol heat only reveals itself once it's down. Overall I'm a little disappointed but I'd like to try it again for a follow-up review."
"Yeah, that's right, this is the Emperor's tripel, boy! Anyway, this stuff pours a mostly clear sunset bronze-amber topped by a finger of off-white foam. Some floaties show up, but nothing much to speak of. The nose comprises plenty of dark fruits (primarily figs, though some dates shine through as well), Belgian yeast, clove, light cinnamon, candied orange peel, and good amount of sweet biscuit. The taste brings in more of the same, leading with the spices, then into a sweeter version of the fruits, then a strong wave of caramel, biscuit, and booze. The body is a lithe medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a sorta/kinda drying finish. Overall, a nice tripel, but the booze is a touch off-putting, and it comes across more like a spicy BSDA than a tripel, but it still ain't bad."
""
"Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Pours a hazy, deep red brown amber, massive head and very active carbonation. A number of dark brown, fruit flavored chunks floating at the top. Head is long lasting and leaves massive lacing. Powerful aroma of caramel malt, dark fruits, inviting. Very pleasant dark fruits, very malty, and caramel flavor. Complex and medium to heavy bodied. A very nice ale that I hope to revisit often."
"I warmed up to this beer as it warmed to ambient temperature. The label of a dark Tripel really threw me off. This is a Belgian Strong Dark in my opinion, and it should flaunt this fact, as it is a great showcase for the style. All the good qualities are there: high ABV that's well hidden, stone fruit prominent in the nose and flavor, great body, and rich flavors that are offset by the barely there hops, used only for bittering purposes. The only complaint or word of wisdom would be to watch out for the temperature for this beer, because I let it sit out too much and it started tasting like grape juice a little too much. Grape juice with spices and bitterness, that is."

"Taken separate, the very beginning or end could be considered cloying. But that long, drawn out middle connects them wonderfully, and the result is an amazingly well-balanced beer that still manages to be adventurous and extreme. It's fabulous."

"O - I was a bit worried about this because of the overly-sweet aroma, but this ended up being quite fantastic. I would most definitely buy this again (even an entire case)!"
"A really nice beer!"
"O: Seems to be a very drinkable beer, and I will have no problem taking down this 750 by myself. It has a touch too much carbonation than I prefer. This one doesn't seem to set itself out from the pack from me, but its worth a try. *EDIT* I let this sit for a few minutes and after the carbonation wore down I like it a lot more."
"O: This is my second time tasting this beer and it had not disappointed either time. It well balanced, easily drinkable, and had a wonderful complex flavor."
"Overall: Well, the numbers don't add up, but I really like this one quite a bit. Better than the Grand Cru."
"O: Very good - a nice beer that was full-flavored yet fairly easy to drink."
"O- Nice beer, but definitely not best in style for me. Still, it's worth drinking if you haven't tried it before. I enjoyed this one, and glad it wasn't skunked (from the green glass)."
"Overall, I'm going to say that this is an average beer for the style. Because, if you mostly ignore the yeast islands, it is. If you heavily consider the yeast islands though, ugh."
"O: delicious, I was skeptical going into this--I'm not a huge fan of big malty beers--but this one really surprised."
"Brasserie des Rocs Triple Imperiale was dark brown in color (red with some sediment floating about when held to a light). It had a large off-white head with very good retention and left a little lacing. The smell was dark fruit, dark malt, and spicy yeast. The taste was malt, dark fruit, and yeast flavors and spices. The finish was long, fruity, and semi-dry. The mouthfeel was very good with a full body and creamy carbonation. The drinkability was excellent. This is a very good Belgian Ale and well worth trying out."
"Note: Expiration date on bottle indicates best before end of 2009, so this beer must be aged."
"Quite enjoyable and with a great level of carbonation. Nose improves through the bottle. A fresher bottle would likely be more enjoyable as well as for the flavor. A bit too oriented towards a brown sugar flavor. A fresher brew may or may not offer such character. In the mean time filter this one for the yeast/protein chunk is out of control in the end."
"750ml bottle served in my Captain Lawrence tulip at 53 degrees. Best before end 2009 indicated on the back label. Bottle opens with a slight gush. Pours a murky mahogany with a dense and frothy two inch, cream-colored head that eventually settles into a solid quarter inch cap. Lots of floaties present in solution and also dispersed across the surface of the head. I'm really digging the nose on this - candied dark fruit (figs and prunes) at first, but there's also an earthy woodiness present in the mix, as well as a trace of spice. Taste follows nose - not as sweet or cloying as suggested by the nose. A bit of caramel or toffee follows that candied fruit before revealing some cherry tartnesss towards the finish. Mouthfeel is medium-light with a pleasant, even carbonation and a light bit of astringency towards the end. A truly top notch example of the style. Easy drinking and complex without being overly sweet. Alcohol is extremely well-hidden as well at 10%. I'll have to pick-up a newer vintage to see how it compares."
"jd"
"D - well made and very enjoyable, malt makes it slow going"
"I recommend this brew!"
"In short: a rich malty, fruity brew with nutmeg-like spiciness and sticky texture."
"Pours dark brown with a slight head that falls to a thin collar and a galaxy cap. Spins out to a thin collar throughout. The nose is not clearly as sweet as the Brune. There is a stronger plum/prune character with some very slight spice. There is some grape in the nose. The taste is dry without too much sweetness. A bit of mild earthy character; maybe some slight hints of tobacco. There are plum and dark fruits as well. Mild date character. The finish is a bit too dry and mildly astringent. Strange, somewhat-sharp dryness there. No booze at all, which is quite impressive. Drinkable but nowhere near the level of the Brune."
"Beer is thin and sweet up front and mildly dry. The finish has a mild roast and a mild bitterness. Lots of yeast character on the early to midpalate. Decent mouthfeel and a nice finish."
"Poured a auburn-brown body with a frothy, cloying head that died slow and left a lace ring down the glass. A great aroma of orange/yeast that I always find in Belgians and then a large, sweet (caramel) malt smell with some breadiness and a minor touch of hops and fruit. A real smooth, medium body that borders on creaminess. Has a strong, sweet taste of caramel, chocolate and some sugary/sticky like maple or...a touch of breadiness gives the malts balance and a bit of its dry edge. There are also some citrc hops and something akin to tropical fruits in the backend, giving a slightly fruity taste as it finishes which works well w/ the malts. A easy and wonderful to enjoy sipper that has a touch of complexity and I still can't believe the ABV hits 10%; they did a grat job having ABV complement beer but not overpower it."
"D: High. Lovely Beer"
"Drinkability: a very pleasant sipping beer. I would never have more than one alone, but can't wait to split the next one with a friend. Defining drinkability as the enjoyment factor rather than trying to label as session beer this is very drinkable in a sitting and you are set for the night."
"Overall - Though I think I prefer the Grand Cru Special Brown from this brewery, this is also an excellent beer from them, and I'm glad I've tried it. You won't be disappointed if you like BSDA's."
"Drinkability does suffer from an alcoholic bite to the beer, and the massive amount of stuff in the beer. While it does nothing o hurt the smell or taste, just looking at it makes me a bit queezy. Still was enjoyable."
"D: A tale of two beers -- the carefully decanted first half was one of the most enjoyable beers I have had, easil a personal top ten. The second half, however, was marred by the protein problem and makes me wonder if this beer was mishandled somewhere along the chain. I will try it again, but only after a snow globe test to see if protein is there."
"What I like most about this beer is that it's really not all that sweet. Lush, full mouthfeel with medium carbonation. It was good to revisit this one. It's a beer I had good memories of that holds up years later."
"Very nice for a dark triple, although still a hair below Gulden Draak."
"Pours a hazy orange tinted red with billowing cream colored head. After a few minutes settles to a half inch with a few clumps of lace left behind. Lots of floaties. Smell: white wine at first, which was scary, but that faded after a bit. Still a little grapey, dates, brown sugar, a little soft powdery banana. Earthy hop note. Taste: a mouthful of dark brown sugar, dates, but cutting through the sweetness, earthy and slightly peppery. Cherry in the finish, some cigar in the aftertaste. There's a touch of alcohol, but at the warm temperature and 10% it's really pretty well hidden. Definitely got more interesting as it progressed. Best by 6/4/2012."
"A great change from other belgians, wish more were made in this style."
"This is a re-review, really much lower than the original review."
"D: Watch out, this one is easy to plow through. Enjoy it and the high ABV, too."
"two thumbs up."
"A beer to be sought out. The quintessential big malt Trippel, and maybe my favorite Trippel overall. A tip of the hat."
"Overall I was a bit perplexed when the ""triple"" I ordered came out looking like this but I was soon assuaged by a smooth beverage. This beer does all the little things right and is well worth a shot."
"salud!"
"EDIT: The expiration date was over a year away, so it was not a beer that was too old."
"Drinkability: A very drinkable, delicious Belgian Ale. Worth a try by anyone who loves a good Belgian."
"Peppery spice up front with some dark malt, light and dark fruit notes, candy sugar and slight alcohol warmth. Pretty smooth with the high ABV well masked. Complex and well balanced Belgian Strong Ale."
"Good amount of sediment. Outstanding mouthfeel, sediment aside. Poured with a generous foamy head that left a decent amount of lace. Very dark fruit in this one. Raisins, plums, blackberries and Cabernet wine. Silky and dry at the same time. Pair with a good steak."
"This is a good beer. More flavor comes out as this warms up. The earthy and and dryness are very distinct for this brewery. Something I would recommend."
"This is a fine beer to slowly sip and savor. I'd like to try this aged, but even young it is apparent that this is a quality brew."
"Wow, this is completely not what I was expecting! All the smooth flavors of the complex palate make this one intriguing beer. Definitely on my top."
"This one gushed like no other. After clean up, it poured a murky rusty brown. For such an explosive start, the head calmed to a ring around the glass. Aroma is full of dried fruits (figs and prunes), pineapple, grape, caramel, toffee, spice, alcohol, and apple. In the flavor, I got much from aroma with the addition of dried apricots, nuts, brown sugar, and a hint of coconut. While the aroma was more estery, the flavor brings more earthy grains. Both aspects of this ale are complex, do doubt enhanced from several years of aging. Full-bodied and at 10%, I wouldn't guzzle this one. One to share and sip."
"A 750ml bottle shared with psycohops and brothercannon out on the tasting patio. Poured into a trio of shaker glasses. The ale appears a hazed crimson amber color with about an inch of ecru colored foam. The aromas and flavors consist of fruits such as dark cherries, prunes, raisins, candi, brown sugar, notes of dark chocolate, yeast. Approaching full bodied for the style with ample carbonation. Good stuff."
"D - This beer is remarkable, it is complex, and it relatively inexpensive"
"33cl bottle with a BBD of July '11. Pours a hazy dark caramel color with a small light tan head that disappears quickly. Loads of sediment, despite the careful pour. Smells heavily sweet and fruity, with notes of orange and cherry. A bit of brown sugar and some chocolate, as well as alcohol. Tastes of dark fruits and dark caramel malts. Very yeasty, giving it a nice tang. Much dryer than one would think going in. Warming alcohol finish. Light-medium body with heavy carbonation. Pretty pleasant."
"This beer pours up a deep, reddish brown and has a big fluffy, lingering head. The aroma is brown sugar, roasted malt, and prunes. The taste really delivers what you'd expect for a Belgian special dark... it's very big. Lots of raisin and sweet malt, light breadiness, plums, and some other estery fruit flavors including apple. Drinking this beer is like eating the best fruit cake you can imagine; and I mean that in the best possible way. Mouthfeel is thick, almost syrupy and conveys the flavor very well. Definitely a beer for the holidays."
"Refined, complex and sweet BSDA. The beer pours a rich dark brown, like deep, damp soil. The head leaves pleasant lacing. The aroma is downright elegant. There are notes of brown sugar, clove, raisins, plums, caramel, earthy yeast and dark bread. The flavor is sweet and fruity. It's a bit sweet for my taste, but there's still a lot of fruit and spice complexity. There's also an odd tootsie roll flavor that's sort of enjoyable. The flavor is akin to honeyed plums, which is not something I've ever actually tasted, so take that for what you will. The mouthfeel is smooth and creamy. It's a tad sweet for me to call it highly drinkable."
"Drinkability: Moderately high. I had to warm up to this one as it didn't catch my palate right away. Fortunately, it took me a while to get through it and more of the flavors really started to come out from the warming."
"D: ABV is very well hidden and drinks easy."
"D - Fairly drinkable. Not really bad from a flavor perspective, just extremely lacking. A pass overall with all the other great examples out there."
"Dark brown and mahogany brew with a small head and a ton of floating particles. Smells of bready malts. Tastes are bready malt, candied sugar, raspberries and a bit of citrus hop. Very rich sweetness. Medium body with low carbonation. A good sipper, but I don't think I'd buy it again."
"Notes: Well, from what I can tell, Brasserie Des Rocs seems to have some Quality Control issues. The Grand Cru was quite chunky and gushed like Old Faithful, while this one had huge chunks in it as well. I took the first couple of sips when it was a little colder, and came close to making it a drainpour due to the overwhelming sweetness of this chunky beverage. But, once it warmed up a bit it improved tremendously...like all Belgians seem to do! Ended up bumping the flavor score up as a result. In the end, I was a bit disappointed by this one, though."
"Note on 10/09/2009: Beer is now over 3 years aged in celler condition and is much more balanced on the alcohol feel level. Malts and toasted barley are more dominate... great aged beer."
"Pours an amberish brown color with a thin tan head. Fantastic nose of spicy alcohol, bready malts, sweet fruits and peppery Belgian yeast. The taste does not quite match the aroma. It still has a nice blend of sweet malts and herbal yeast, but they are not nearly as impressive. However, I did find the same intriguing funky tartness that made their Brune so delicious. Medium body seems a bit over carbonated and needs time to settle down, but drinks well."
"Poured the bottle into a duvel glass. Appears a dark amber color with a head that dissipates slowly with very little left after a few minutes. Aroma of brown sugar, rasin, figs, and chocolate. More of the same in the taste. I love how the taste of brown sugar dominates, with the others creeping in: caramel, raisins, and figs. High in the carbonation with a sweet finish. Pretty goof beer. Will try again."
"Biegaman offered to share this with me, two years past its BB date. Did not gush on opening as expected but was chock full of suspended tofu-like particles that muddied the amber/brown liquid despite the slow controlled pour. Fleeting tan head, thick solid ring remained, some lacing in sheets easily regenerated with a swirl that featured small-bubble clusters at the centre. Small bubble carbonation hidden in the murky haze but continued to drift upwards. Smell of caramel, sweet molasses, brown sugar, yeast. Taste is caramel, sweet dark fruit, raisins, figs, bitter, touch of sour, long drawn out finish with alcohol weighing in with a warming affect, although not offensive considering the ABV. Overall, a good representation of the style I think but the floaters are a bit of a turn off."
"Unfortunately, that hasn't been the experience every time. Abbaye De Rocs are clearly good brewers but more obvious is their one flaw: quality control. About 6 years ago I had my first ADR experience and vividly remember two things: really liking the beer; and the server explaining to me not to worry, those chunks in my glass were natural. If they ever find a way to get it right consistently, ADR is more than welcome to stock up my cellar."
"Drinkability: This one's good, but very intense. Perhaps a few years would do it well, as it's still a little hot, and at 10.0% is gonna be hot for a little while. That said, it's still a damn fine brew, tasty, reasonably complex, but the flavors and aromas just didn't really jump out at me in a way that made me want to rate it higher. Perhaps another day."
"D - Great beer, would love to enjoy more."
"Overall a ridiculously tasty dark Belgian beer. Not on par with the top tier dark Belgians, but did remind me in many ways of St. Bernardus Abt 12 without the depth and complexity. For the price I would prefer some other brews, but this was indeed very good. It was also pretty unique, and I would get it again for something different."
"One little bottle is more than enough."
"Not the best looking beer in the world. Kind of a muddy chocolate milk color, not much head. This was an excellent beer in terms of it's taste and smell. It was malty, Belgiany (of course), a little chocolate, not much roast to it, and the body was a happy medium with the alcohol not showing up a ton in the flavor. Very easy drinking big beer, and very tasty."
"Decent but expected a bit more."
"Overall an excellent brew."
"D: Watch all that gunk in there. Bread pudding!"
"Very flavorful brew."
"The aroma has plums, figs, raisins, brown sugar, floral hops, spices, and yeast. The appearance is red-orange-brown with a medium sized foamy head. The flavor is complex like the aroma. It has all the same elements and is very sweet. There is also a hint of coffee. The palate is nice and is the appropriate thickness. The aftertaste is also sweet with plenty of malt and alcohol. Overall it's very nice."
"Great Belgian ale that is very smooth I am enjoying this with Valencay Belgique Cendre goat cheese - what a treat!"
"Re-rate/taste. 750ml bottle tasted on 1/19/07. In addition to those mentioned from before, candi sugar sweet (aromas and tastes) - not cloying. Increased some of the numbers this time around."
"Pours a dark brown red color, slight tannish head, somewhat lasting. Dark grape aroma, very strong & wine-y. Very strong aroma. Strong dark fruit taste. Sour aftertaste. Malty grapey taste. Odd but not really my style. Some dark Belgians I like, some I don't. This one falls in the don't category for me."
"D- I have no doubt that this was excellent at one time, but as myself and BA buddies drank this we all concurred that this bottle was definitely on its way out the door. As it was, it's not terribly drinkable."
"Aroma was brown sugar and yeasty. The taste was sweet and malty. Dates, figs and fairies jumped around in my head. The abv was well hidden as the 10 percent didn't make much of a mark. In the mouth this one was nicely carbonated but just too much yeast or protein flowing around in large chunks. Overall I had to give this one a lower score on the final as it became hard to drink because of the excess chunks. Other than that is was good."
"Pours a very nice looking deep ruby amber color. Pretty cloudy (could be from the 8 lbs of yeast/protein coagchunks commonly found in BdesR brews) nice white head that fades to a skim of foam pretty quick. Nose is laoded with dark fruit. Taste follows with candied plum, raisin, some fig, dark sugar, some slight spice. Super rich taste. Mouthfeel is nice and viscous, but slightly overcarbonated which I kind of like. Drinkability is nice, but slightly rough. Overall a fine example of the style, a very rich and hearty brew that should be shared with friends on a cold night. Very nice color. I like this one from BdR. A good beer."
"Definitely a heavy body on this badboy, though I will admit that drinkability suffers from the overall sweetness... not to mention 10% ABV, though this is fairly well-hidden. But definitely a good beer nonetheless, and I would gladly enjoy another bottle."
"A strong yet very enjoyable beer. Nicely flavored with plenty of sweetness without going anywhere near being too heavy or thick. Full fruity flavor over grains makes this a nice Strong Dark."
"D: Not the most drinkable. Too rich in dark fruit for me."
"Definitely let it warm up before trying it. It is so much better as it warms. Complex... a bit fruity for me, but enjoyable nonetheless."
"High ABV slightly warming. I am not a big fan of sour, tart beers but this one is well done."
" do yourself a favor and put this one in the cellar."
"Overall, a disappointment. Different, but not good."
"Rustic as rustic can get and enjoyable. The heaviness of the offering precludes supreme drinkability."
"D - Tasty and complex. A little sweeter with more caramel and chocolate and more subtle dark fruits than other BSDA's but a tasty twist."
"Kind of a hard beer to review. It's overpowering in both aroma and taste; this is hard on both the palette and the drinking stamine. It's just ... strange. The Grand Cru and Special Brown are two very, very underrated beers, so I expected to enjoy this more."
"Another great brew, if you can ignore the ever present and quite ugly floaters."
"D - Drinks well for a high alcohol and dark belgian beer. Alcohol is well hidden behind a complex wall of sweet and spice. Certainly worth trying and another solid brew from Des Rocs."
"Has an absolutely wonderful fruity smell .... some nice head on the pour.... is very complex, crazy! (fruit,rum,raisins,grape, xmas bread etc...) ... quite fizzy for a belgian strong ... a true joy to drink .. Bring On The ROCS! ... this brewery sure puts out some enjoyable brews!"
"D- This is a great beer to enjoy with a friend and sit around and have a deep conversation. Highly drinkable. This will expand your horizons."
"Great interesting beer."
"drinkability is good. nicely balanced, hiding the alcohol almost completely. nice mix of darik fruit and belgian yeast/spice character. good stuff."
"Tons of floaties in the chalice, especially at the end of the bottle; quite ""sludge-like"" appearance. Finishes with a pleasant alcohol warming which blends perfectly with the ale's overall sweetness. Another superb offering from this great Belgian brewery"
"I had a bottle of this at The Room in Miami Beach, FL."
"Drinks pretty good for the abv & complexity. Not the best of the style but interesting enough to make you want more. A nice fire side sipper"
"Overall- I had never heard of this one before I had it at my friends house. After seeing the high score, I am a little confused. To me, it was way too sweet and the appearance was pretty gross. I would not seek it out, but I guess it would be worth another shot someday."
"Net: Not my favorite BSDA, and, sorry guys, I can't uphold the A rating from my point of view. Maybe with more cellaring, it would improve."
"D: Shared this one with some friends. Enjoyed it thoroughly, but there's not way I could finish a bottle by myself."
"From a 1 pint, 9.4 fl. oz bottle with elegant black foil, I must say that I really expected more from this... Upon opening the cap, I was greeted with a huge whiff of alcohol which permeated from the bottle... Aroma is similar to a dark, spiked apple cider, which was quite surprising... nothing really appealing about the appearnce... pours a watery, brown color, perhaps slightly ruby-red with minimal lacing and head... Aroma wasn't very enticing - strong alcohol with perhaps some plum notes... taste was more of a disappointment than anything else... the bottle logo reads ""Belgian Special Dark Ale"" - but the flavor was a negative shock... strong alchol and raisin flavor with slight figs, prunes, and plum taste... very watery with a strong alcohol presence... expected much more from this brew and was really let down with this one... I'm not sure what they were thinking but this does not taste like any true Belgian that I have ever sampled... Did not enjoy this one at all, and for the money that I shelled out for this one, was pretty upset that I didn't even end up finishing the bottle... Don't bother..."
"D: For 10%? Amazingly good. I didn't find the alcohol to be boozy or hot. In fact, we had a hard time finding any alcohol at all. Complex and inviting. Any excellent beer for a cold winter night!"
"Excellent beer."
"Great carbonation, prickly and fine. Rich but easy to drink. Drinkability takes a bit of a hit from all the big yeast floaties."
"Good thing this thing has floaters it causes you to sip it and really enjoy it. LOL Not the first Belgium that I have had floaters in"
"Prosit und Zum Wohl, MK"
"Recommended. A very nicely done BSDA."
"Pretty good and one of the best beers of this type. A little sweet and tasty but the lack of clarity does cost it a few points. Scent could be a little more complex. A good beer."
"I was pleased with this beer becasue it has definitely potential, but I really can't see this getting an outsnading rating; I have 3 more in my fridge and I'll be sure to try at least one more and maybe ammend my rating."
"This one has been sitting around in the fridge for a couple months waiting for me to try it, so last night was the night as I was in the mood for something different. Poured a very deep dark and hazy brown with a huge tan head of gooey and foamy lace. Lots of visible carbonation throughout the session. A nice concentric ring of side lace was left throughout and some sediment was visible. The smell was interesting, lots of yeast and spice, but for some reason seemed muted, and at the same time kind of sweet. The taste was very full and robust. Lots of flavors with hints at dark fruits and a nice rounded earthy back. There was a slight tart like twang in the bite and a short finish that I thought could have been more drawn out. Not a hint at all of the 10% ABV and it was remarkably smooth for being so heavy. Overall this was an odd one, there was nothing really bad at all about it, but it just did not really stand out to me as anything fantastic other the very smooth nature of it. Almost silk like it was solo smooth. This was definitely a nice triple, but to be honest I have had better. Thats ok though it is still a very good beer and something I would say you should definitely try if given the chance."
"The beer after its release from the 750ml bottle sets in the chalice a beclouded burgundy color an off white creamy head that towers over the luscious body, as it slowly decomposes; the lace forms a thick blanket upon the glass. Nose is rich with the aroma of black cherries, walnuts, sweet malt, hints of alcohol, and fresh toasted bread, what a treat to just smell this beer. Start is sweet with malt and cherries, touch of spices, and the top medium to full. Finish has a stern acidity, the hops delectable, the cherries and malt last to the dry ending, the alcohol warms the innards, and all I can say is Woo Hoo!"
"Millions of little bubbles coat the glass, partially masking a fairly hazy copper-brown liquid. Big, bubbly tan head. Big malty scent, plum, fruits, candy. Intense taste, all sorts of dark fruits, candy, sweet malt, warming alcohol, ginger, spices. Holy shit. Big, chewy mouth feel. This is one hell of a brew. All sorts of action in the taste will keep you interested throughout the bottle."
"I really prefer the flavor of this beer out of the bottle opposed to having it on tap. The bottle provides a better level of carbonation and better flavor as well. Overall, it is a really good beer. I am glad I didn't write it off. Worth picking up and sampling."
"I didn't find the alcohol to be pronounced at all. I also didn't think the carbonation was out of the ordinary like some other reviewers. I think this is a very drinkable beer if one paired it with a good attitude and meal. Thanks Paul!"
" Strong and sweet this should be reserved for special occasions."
"This is certainly a nice beer, but I've had much better strong darks - well worth a try though."
"This very cloudy brown beer, poured into a wide-mouthed chalice, boasts a small but thick and creamy head. Nose is fairly malty, tending to caramel, together with a rich red fruitiness. Very nice flavor, with more emphasis on malt than many Belgians--caramelish, toffee flavors are present right at the front. Fruity esters make up a large part of the taste component, with notes of raisins and roasted cherries. There's also a nice yeasty spiciness, maybe with a hint of licorice, at the finish. Very tasty, one of the best offerings from the brewery."
"The beer foamed out the bottle and there is a slight ring of scum around the neck of the bottle left over, so maybe I got a bad bottle. I hate to give such a highly rated beer a mediocre review, but I'm not going to let that change my opinion. I'll try it again in the future to see if there was a problem with my sample."
"Comment: This is a wonderful dark alerich, well balanced, and yet complex. Ill be looking for this one whenever I supplement my stash."
"Uncap this and prepare for instant nirvana."
"D - This is an amazing beer. It is well-balanced and easy to drink despite it's high alcohol content."
"This is one hell of a brew. Has that Abbaye des Roc yeast strain. Smells of apricots, plums, figs and cherries. Very smooth delivery with a nice dry finish. Nothing offensive..I'm not sure this qualifies as a triple, looks more of a belgian dark, nice looking head as well. Love this beer."
"Fantastic silky smooth mouthfeel, though the foaming took away my carbonation. I hope one of my other bottles will have a bit more life left in it when I get it into the glass - I suspect if so this will approach my personal top 10. Otherwise, it is extremely drinkable, and hides the ABV completely. This stuff could be dangerous."
"Drinkability- Not so much. This beer is too big and sweet for my tastes."
"Drinkability is great. This is such a pleasant and easy beer to sip. Nice flavors, but not too heavy, and with remarkably well hidden alcohol."
"D: One of the most drinkable big beers that I have ever had, the 10% is completely hidden, an excellent beer, would recommend it to anyone. I'm glad I reviewed it for #100."
"This is an odd one. I adore sweet beers, but this is almost a bit much even for me - more in texture than actual taste. Tastes are deep and neverending. Wouldn't mind a little less fresh wood and funky yeast. All in all, one of those ""ones to try"" - it'll expand your beer vocabulary."
"Ordered a bottle of this last night at the Sunset Grille, and was poured into a tulip stemmed glass. I wanted to try an Tripel Imperiale, but the bottle also said it was a Strong Dark Ale. A confusing but new style to me (why not just call it a strong dark ale?), but honestly I thought it would look more like a tripel then a dubbel. That said, it had a nice brown color to it, and a lingering head. It tasted like any good Belgian dubbel or strong dark ale that I've had. I liked it, but wasn't blown away. For $7.99 a bottle, it was worth trying once but there are so many other Belgians out there that I haven't had yet..."
"Nice Belgian beer that starts off great but there's something about that aftertaste that puts me off a bit. I may have to try again sometime to see if I feel the same way."
"How's drinkability, you ask? I am ashamed to say that I essentially quaffed this brew.... I simply could not stop drinking it. And I wish I had another. This beer is fantastic in every aspect... although I did not give it all 5's, I find it very difficult to think of anything I would have changed about this beer. A big thumbs up to the Belgian boys at abbaye des rocs... you have a winner in this one."
"Good stuff."
"I so wish I could try a Brasserie des Rocs beer that was 100% liquid. It'll take a lot of convincing to get me to buy another bottle though. It's too bad."
"Notes: Its not for me. I know this carries an excellent reputation but I've never been able to grasp its goodness. Its in there I""m sure but I can't find it. Give this one some time to settle."
"Drinkability: I can't see myself ever wanting to drink this again, it's entirely too sweet for me."
"I've had floaties and sediment in my beer, and that's ok. This is beyond that though. Off-putting in the worst possible way. Drain Pour."
"Extremely drinkable, could replace Allagash Odyssey as my favorite BSDA."
"-Oelergud"
"D: A very easy drinking beer. In fact, it was too easy. The alcohol was barely there, in taste and also in how it affected me. I drank the entire bottle of supposedly 10% ABV and I was barely even buzzed. This never happens. I've read several other reviews suggesting that this brewery has quality control problems and based on my small sample size I'd have to agree. I'd like to give this beer another shot at some point since I was very disappointed to buy a top 100 beer and have a poor tasting experience. I'd like to see what it tastes like without the glass being packed full of white chunks."
"A medium-full body with a creamish feel on the tongue and a nip of tart to finish it off...very drinkable taste treat here. An excellent ale that is the style, what can I say?"
"Taste is complex ranging from figs, chocolate, tobacco to other toasted malts. Flavors are so soft yet multi-dimensional. All work in perfect harmony. Mouthfeel is luxuriously smooth and soft. Full body, but not overbearing or overly chewy. Finishes slightly dry, but very satisfying. Holy ass this is fantastic! Drinkability is out of this world for a brew with this alcohol content. Simply awesome. Incredible."
"Had on tap at La Chatalaine in Dublin Ohio. Dark copper color with a hint of haziness, nice lacing from the light tan head. The aroma is really strong with darkish fruits, I imagined cherries, figs, and raisins. Really nice. The flavor had the fruits, but mixed with a splash of cough syrup (I could do without that) and a mild alcoholic burn on the backside. Still good, as I like the dark fruit flavor in this style of beer. Nice authentic Belgian Dark Ale."
"An absolute winner and highly recommended."
"Capped 750ml bottle poured into a chalice. Pours a dark ruby reddish brown color with a light tan head and some yeast particles floating around. The aroma is a bit tart with some fruits and spice. The taste is absolutely heavenly with a lot of malt, dark fruits and spices rolling all over the tongue with a nice yeasty finish. The mouthfeel is silky smooth and fits the brew perfectly. Overall, this is an absolutely phenomenal beer that is extremely complex and simply out of this world. This is certainly one of the finest brews in the world in my opinion."
"Not a bad beer at all though."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, with a very smooth natural carbonation, and despite the sweetness, the drinkability is pretty darn good. I'm glad that this is only a 33ml bottle, as I don't think i could drink a large bottle of this due to the sweetness."
"I never really searched for this so much as I kept my eyes open, but when I found it I felt as though I'd completed a quest, and it's worthy of such an honorial status. It's a wonderful yeasty Belgian that, in spite of some serious ABV and candy sweetness, drinks like a complex but artful dream. I know where it is now and there's more in my near future."
"From the moment I unrapped the foil, I knew this was going to be something exceptional. First time I've come accross a brew that was both bottle capped and corked so that a corkscrew was necessary. The cork was simply drenched in sticky candied sugar which was a spectacular first glimpse of what was to come. At first, I thought this was a traditional chocolate brown brew, but once I brought it up to the light I was amazed to find a ruby red elixir with specks of yeast, like a snowstorm in a glass. Wow. The head was modest following the pour, but foamy traces were found with each swirl of the glass. Very surprinsing appearance and just another indicator that this was one unique Belgian. The smell of sweet candied sugar was very pronounced in the nose with aged strawberries and other like-fruit. This is an expressive nose moreso than any other I can remember. So far, I love the aggressiveness of this beer. The taste was incredibly fruity. Strawberries again with cherries drenched in candied sugar and maple syrup. Alcohol was evident in the finish, but fruity sweetness preavailed. Mind you, the sweetness is strong, but in a very, very pleasant way. It's not sweet like a lambic. It's more like an aged port wine with perfect fruitiness and sweetness in harmony with one another. The mouthfeel is viscous and chewy. The beer bathes the tongue in a thick blanket of candied sugar and fruit. With each pull from my tulip glass, the aroma and taste made for an incredibly consumming sensory experience. Some alcohol notes in the finish but the fruit and sugar rule the day. This is an excellent, drinkable treat. So suprising in so many ways and so very worth it. Highly distinctive from all the rest and that is precisely what makes it worthwhile. I very much recommend it."
"Poured with a nice foamy textured head and some lace. Hazy dark amber color. Heavenly nose of very ripe berries, plums, caramel, malt. Flavor is the same but with some yeastiness. Hardly able to sense the alcohol. Great mouth. Very satisfying sweet finish."
"*addendum: I have heard tell of bad bottles of a few BdR's beer, esp. the dark ones. While I don't mean to imply that you shouldn't buy them, definitely check the dates and try to ensure that there are no ""masses"" in the bottle that ought no to be there, and to be proactive in letting the store and brewery know about the issue."
"Delicious! Let's get that out of the way... The color was a cloudy, amber color. Smell was terrific, but I can't discern any detailed ingredients. The taste was slightly spicy and strong but flavorful. It almost has a hint of ginger. The mouthfeel is tangy but easy after several sips. Overall wonderful and highly recommended for this style"
"M/D-This beer feels light when it is chilled, but gains a thicker syrupy mouthfeel as it warms....yet remains moderately carbonated as this happens....as far as drinkability the complexity of this beer hides the alcohol very well...I would have never guessed that it was ten percent alcohol if I had not read the label....overall a very wonderful experience. I need to revisit some more strong dark Belgians"
"Not sure if this is my favorite, as I'll need 2-3 more to decide, but this is an extremely good beer."
"The flavor is sweet and fruity and it lingers. It does seem to thin some as it warms and the burn intensifies. As far as drinkability... this one will last the entire movie."
"Incredible!"
"Pours a nice clear ruby red color, nice carbonation, nice two finger head which lasts a long long time, some nice islands and sticky lacing throughout the drink. The nose is of sweet malts, yeast, grapes, figs, prunes, and some caramel. The taste is very nice, mostly malts, yeast, grapes, and figs. Medium body. Very drinkable, another awesome brew from the brewery, highly recommended."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied but with huge flavor. Creamy, slightly dry."
"Very very nice"
"Slick and full in the mouth, the carbonation is smooth and elegant enough to complement the port-like gravity and present this beer in its finest possible light. Words cannot fully describe how beautiful and perfect this Belgian masterpiece is, especially with the cheese pairing. Seek out this beer, and savor the experience from beginning to end."
"The drawback is how this thins as it warms, it just doesnt hold the taste throughout the bottle. And its pricey, hard to imagine this being a regular staple in the fridge."
"d- intense, bready, fruited, with adequate carbonation and beautiful maltiness. a tiny bit sweeter than i was hoping for but, utterly drinkable! Will buy again."
"**Made some updates to the rating on 11/17/07. I purchase this beer every now and then and every time its the same chunky mess. If this beer didn't taste as good as it does it would be a drainpour. The chunkyness is hard to even swallow through. As good as this beer is I have a hard time finishing these 11.2oz bottles because they're so chunky**"
"D- This goes down surprisingly well. I am going to be getting more of this."
"Drinkability: I want more of this one, it's one of the best. It seems especially drinkable for the style, I kept sipping at it, wanting to taste it again and again. Thumbs up."
" Inviting aroma of sweet dark fruit, candy sugar, medium Belgian malt, caramel, and some very mild, peppery notes. Palate is deeply complex - sweet malt, dark fruit, candy sugar, light spices. Just about perfect for the style. Body is rich and velvety smooth, very creamy, although some of the larger chunks of yeast make it a bit chewy at times. The alcohol is certainly well-integrated into the body of this beer - there's no telling it's anywhere near 10%. Unfortunately, as the bottom of the bottle was neared I found myself straining the beer through my teeth to avoid chunks of yeast. Still, a thoroughly excellent brew."
"D: Very tasty, goes down very easily, it has a heavy kick that is well-disguised and makes this beer dangerously drinkable."
"Holy hell. Nice big chunky head covers a red-brown yeast flecked body. The smell is intoxicating full of fruity bits and lots of yeast with sweet malt backing it up to give it a candy finish. The taste is deep and lingering, giving many level of enjoyment for sip to sip. There are so many different levels to love this beer on and only the floating yeast near the bottom takes away and that can some what be avoided. Overall this is awesome and I think better than any of their others beers I have had."
"This beer poured a cloudy dark brown color with big chunks of clumped yeast falling into the beer (even though I poured correctly). It had a thick head and nice lacing. The smell is sweet and very molasses like. The taste is smooth and malty. This beer is sweet and well balanced with a hint of the typical Belgian sourness. The mouthfeel is thick but shy of chewy. I love this beer and consider it quite drinkable!"
"in the end it's a little coughsyrupy...actually i wonder if it's been contaminated (it shares something with a batch of my homebrew that ended up contaminated). it's not so prominent that i'm convinced it's bad...afterall some funky stuff can be quite desireable in beer"
"Pours a dark ruby orange with an offwhite head that settles quickly to thin covering. Smells of rich dark malt and very winey. Rich fruit on the nose as well with notes of mascerated cherries, raisins, and apples. The taste is very nice indeed with lots of complex flavors. Starts very creamy with notes of dark fruit, sweet malt, apple, apricot, and continues into a creamy, nutty finish. Very little notice of the high abv- it is very well integrated into the overall taste. Surprisingly light in body for the alcohol and flavor profile. Perilously drinkable!"
"Drinkability is very good. This is quite easy to drink and very enjoyable. As drinkable as it is, ABV must be kept in mind as the alcohol taste becomes more apparent, numbing the mouth a bit."
"The color is a muddled mahagoony and red oak color. Hard to see some of that carbonation. The carbonation shows itself with a good two finger starter head that eventually recedes to nothing. The color is a sweet, and holiday spicey aroma. Candy toasted malts with some hints of alcohol. Not detering, but inviting you. The tase is inviting as it is pleasing. The sweet, cabdy like malt is great. Makes your day a little sweeter after getting off work. Hints of sweet toffee, amber mlats, light molasses and brown sugar. Not as much carbonation as I would of liked, but still sweet, malty and spicey overall. And fun to drink."
"Very good, not as drinkable as a westmalle or even the karmeleit, but delicious in its own unique way. I imagine this is what triples were like historically, before the movement to lighter, drier ales we are accustomed to"
"Given that others have been floored by this Brasserie de l'Abbaye des Rocs offering, I'm prepared to believe that I got a less than perfect bottle. The problem is, there are any number of great BSDAs out there that are stunning each and every time I pop the cap. I'll try another bottle or two, but I'm not interested in playing Belgian roulette too many more times."
"Bottle courtesy of Adrian910ss: Poured a cloudy dark brown color ale after some gushing, with a big foamy head with great retention. Aroma of candi sugar, strong Belgian malt and slightly funky yeast. Taste of sweet Belgian malt with nice candi sugar and funky yeast prove a balance and complex beer. Body is above average with low filtration and great carbonation. Alcohol is well hidden. Another great beer from this fine Belgian brewery."
"Okay...but for me it had a second chance and didn't take it and if you're looking for a well balanced beer, let's just say this one's no Circus Tightrope Walker."
"Polished, balanced, and beautiful. This is a wonderful brew that I will gladly revisit."
"Picked up a bottle for the holidays. At first sip it's reminiscent of Carlous Grand Cru of the Emporer [sp]. This beer is a hazy brown with a subtle but enticing with dark candied fruit. Taste expands on the fruit without goign overboard like I sometimes feel Trois Pistoles does. Typical belgian dark fruit flavors with figs, raisins, grapes, and a bit of apple. The taste isn't outstanding in the field of strong dark belgians, but it's still great. This beer does however have great balance and drinkability. It's not too sweet like some belgians and there's little hint that it's 10% abv."
"Initially, drinkability was wonderful. Good taste, great carbonation and good mouthfeel led to a nice sipping beer. However, for some reason unknown to me, after a few glasses I did not feel the desire to continue drinking. I didn't even finish the bottle. Because of this I dropped the Drinkability rating from 4.5 to 4.0."
"Pours a hazed red/brown, bit of a gusher, huge off white head forms, settles down to a thick layer, nice lacing and great retention. Smell is sweet, tons of toffee and yeast, very caramelized, citrus, some bread, almost barleywine in character. Taste is sweet and caramelized again, rich chocolate and toffee, some yeast, little citrus, super malty, dates, slightly oxidized but fantastic flavour. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with low to medium carbonation, excellent sipper."
"Pours a hazy deep amber brown that appears shadowy beneath a thick, lively tan head. Smells and tastes of fruit (apple?) and malt. The alcohol is pretty well hidden. Complex and very drinkable. A great beer to enjoy with some good food. Highly recommended."
"The flavor was very fruity and spicy, carying cherries, plums, molasses, cloves, nutmeg, and cinnamon. The flavors were very well blended and overall very enjoyable. There was a lot of carbonation which ballanced the otherwise very thick beer."
"I guess this is one of those exercises in ""what the hell classification is this belgian""? The bottle says triple, BA says strong dark, and the flavor is somewhere inbetween. Whatever you call it.... it's a fine beverage. While I personally prefer their brune, this is very enjoyable and age worthy. If you see it, pick one up. It's definitely worth the $8 or so that I paid for the 750mL."
"Poured into a trappist glass. I opened the bottle to a gusher. Once I got it into the glass I got a firey brown ale with a creamy beige head that left behind some lace. Cooked brown sugar, cherry, floral notes, toffee, rye bread dough aromas throughout. Light peppery notes with sweet candy. Cherry syrup. Palate is full and round. Very soft. A bit of an alcohol kicker. Superb on every level."
"I would love to have this beer with a nice holiday meal or just a slice of carrot cake. Very tasty brew. Even though it poured with some large chunks, I'd definitly pick this one up again. Cheers!"
"Notes: I can't BELIEVE this beer is 10% ABV. There was no way I would have known that by the taste. A supremely drinkable and flavorful ale, one of the best from Belgium."
"This was an excellent dark ale, deep in its flavors, and quite drinkable despite its high ABV. Definitely worthy of its place in the top 100..."
"Overall, one of the best beers i've had the pleasure of enjoying. It hides the 10% very nicely. Flavor is complex as any other. Just a great beer."
"Just be *careful* when opening it!!!"
"Overall, this one holds it's own against any of the big boys from Belgium(minus the abundance of floaties)."
"I bought this from a very reliable store that I very often frequent. Not sure if this is a bad bottle. Will have to revisit."
"Looks great. Chunky, deep red/brown, and hazy. Has a tan head with good lacing. A mean lookin' brew. Nose is sweet fruits and alcohol, with something heavier but hard to identify coming through. So far so good. The taste is lacking- the alcohol hits hard and lingers, and you get just a mild bit of sugary sweetness and a bitter finish. Not very impressive. It's also thin, which is surprising considering how intense it looks. Drinkability... well you judge based on the ABV."
"Overall: This beer is decent. It is not the best, but far from the worst. What more can I say?"
"very chunky pour...its possible the bottle's been shaken around a bit before being opened. looks good though...chunks dont bother me. red brown color., white head. tons of lacing. smells great, fruity ethanol plumes, cherries. taste is very, very nice. fruity and malty, come caramel notes, sweetening it up. quite mellow and very ncie to drink. probbaly my favorite tripel...most of them are usually too spicy and harsh for me to handle and this is both powerful but tender."
"An excellent Belgian strong dark ale. The flavor is just amazingly complex and well-crafted. It paired very well with some asiago cheese and herbed salami. Highly recommended...a must have!"
"Man, the warmer this gets, the more complex it seems to get. One of those beers that really puts a smile on my face. Exciting, layered, delicous, excellent beer!"
"Definitely worth getting. It could potentially kick your ass if you've had a few other strong beers, but its well worth it. I need to age one of these."
"So, I brought this beer to a PSU tailgate (the Northwestern game, very rainy), hoping to bring some class to the event. Unfortunately, I didn't realize just how much sediment was in this, when I threw it into a cooler and drove it across town. Hence, there were very large yeast chunks floating about in my Chimay chalice. This definitely hurt the appearance, but I'm sure proper storage and slow decanting could save this from happening. Otherwise, the beer had a thin, but lasting, light tan head over a murky brown body. The nose was strong on burnt caramel, with dark fruits and yeast there, too. The taste was slightly burnt caramel, with dark fruits. Very rich, and hid the alcohol well. The mouth was medium-thick, with low carbonation. This is a very easy to drink, rich beer, which I'd like to try again under the right conditions."
"I might try it again but this bottle was not worth the try."
"-UF"
"excellent drinkability, not a hint of the 10% abv, remarkably easy to drink, despite the very sweet flavor. excellent, but is this a triple?"
"Drinkability was outstanding, especially when considering that this beer is 10% ABV."
"Cloudymaybe cloudy was an understatement...this brew is full of yeast, clouds of yeast swirling around. The head is large, white, and rocky. The aromas amazing. Its like smelling a glass full of fresh fruit. Cherries, peaches, plums, grapes, raisins, bananas, and berries, all mingling with yeast. Theres a little Belgian malt in the aroma as well, but the fruity character of the beer is the most amazing quality of the beer. Its a sweet beer, with a spice balance. The yeast flavor is intense, and a little distracting, though. Pretty good carbonation, and a touch warming (not as much as expected, given the ABV). Full bodied, and enjoyablejust not outstanding."
"D: I'll stick with the Brune, as this one wants to do too much but doesn't quite make it there."
"Finally get to try this beaut. Murky copper garnet body. Some sediment made its way in. Two fingers of rocky, off-white/cream head. Tangy sweet fruit all over the nose. Ripe apples, pears, plums, cherries in a fruit cocktail sauce, but tempered by a nice tangy/sourness. Light alcohol and yeast. Taste is wow. Big, sweet, pulpy fruit up front. Explosive flavor, but not cloyingly sweet. Cherries and plums mostly, with a little apple. Sugary malt backdrop with peripheral, but increasing (and welcome) bitterness. Bitterness is almost minty, with (I swear) cloves and even vanilla/oak. Phenomenally complex and delicious. Full body with a near-syrupy feel, but with enough carbonation to lift the sweetness. An amazing beer."
"Thanks to goodbyeohio for the trade, sorry you had to wait so long for the review."
"pours near opaque. smells rich with dried fruits. taste sweet as mollasus and fels very sticky on the tonge. has a wonderful aftertaste and it's only flaw culd be that it's too much, but it's not because I believe this is a unique drink."
"Certainly not bad, this just didn't have a combination of characteristics that I really liked. The drinkability is outstanding, though."
"Pours a three finger light brown head that fades slowly leaving some lace. Cloudy amber color. Medium carbonation and medium bodied. Caramel nose. Starts sweet with a molasses/caramel flavor, the high ABV is almost completely hidden, smooth finish. Nice triple. $4.20 for a 11.2oz bottle Liquids Solutions Tigard, Or."
"Pours a dirty brown with yeast floating around the body that leaves a thin tan head. The aroma is dark ripe fruit (plum, raisin, dates, figs) it has a spicy brown sugar sweetness....great nose! This brew starts tart, dark pale wheat malt with a creamy texture. A slight presence of alcohal but at 10% not very visable. This brew also has a funky, musty, smell as well. This brew is very enjoyable one that is an all night sipper."
"Yum, this is some good stuff, with a nice thick viscous mouthfeel accompanied by a caramel/dark fruit sweetness that envelops the tongue, attempting to mask the 10% alcohol. The alcohol creeps in by midsip, but the malts win the day in the end.	An excellent beer, at an excellent price. A little out of balance with the high alcohol content, but worth seeking out to get your hands on a bottle (or case), to enjoy."
"Some nice subtleties to this one, some funk thrown in, but it really just comes across overall as a really tasty, straight up Belgian ale, which is what it is. Definitely a fun beer."
"This ones awesome. Its original, delicious and phenomenally easy to drink."
"Alcohol very present in the body but not too hot, just warming. Fruity and rich. Toffee and vanilla. Mouth is rather dry in the finish. Very full mouth. Nice caramel and toffee. The richest triple I've ever had."
"D: A terrific beer - warm & rich, tons of character, interesting til the last drop. Not perfect, but pretty darn close. Highly recommended."
"D- This beer is dark and sweet with lots of nice complex flavors and really taste like a special occasion beer."
"This is a very drinkable brew and is one that must be tried by all."
"750ml bottle capped bottle with best before end of 2008 on the back. Upon opening, foam spewed from the top, and it was undisturbed in my fridge for about 3 months. Pours a slightly hazy chestnut brown with a good frothy head, OK longevity and OK lace. Dried dark fruit aromas mixed with a bit of sherry and brown sugar. Smells a bit alcoholic. Again dried dark fruits, brown sugar, vanilla and alcoho;. Not a ton of hop flavor but it is detected in the aftertaste. Thick, sticky and syrupy. This is a great mid winters beer, unfortunatly it is almost July and muggy as hell. I think I will pick up another and stash it away. A fine beer."
"Appearance was a hazy dark cherry color with a large frothy off-white head. Aroma of citrus with hints of sourness, a good helping of sweet malts along with some spice. Flavor of fruit with hints of raisins. Lots of spice, and sweet malt. Very gentle for 10%."
"Drinkability: In many ways, I prefer the body of this beer to the Rocs Grand Cru (though the initial maltiness of the Cru still commends it - see my review). The balance between rich fruits, sour malts, and smooth finish balances this beer, making it particularly drinkable and complex without seeming overengineered."
"It is plenty drinkable. I wish I bought the 750ml bottle and not the much too small 11.2oz bottle. Oh well. There *will* be a next time. This is one of my favorite Belgian brewers and I was not letdown. I purchased my sample in Kansas City, MO. I will get more. Recommended."
"Pours a dark, rusty brown..a little hazy with a short-lived skim of khaki bubbles in a pretty St. Bernie's chalice. Nose is maple syrup/toffee/caramel malt, cherry/fig and musty yeast. Taste is remeniscent of those Ocean Spray juice cran/apple/cherry/grape juice blends, predominantly sweet/tart cherry and fig/date with a solid maple sugar/toffee malt backbone and a hint of spicy yeast. Mouthfeel is thin and smooth with microcarbonation. Where is the 10%? This is insanely drinkable for a BSDA which it certainly resembles much more than any tripel I've had. Some may find it a bit sweet but I find it simply yummy."
"This beer pored a dark brown with subtle orange highlights. The head was 3 fingers thick, light tan, and lasted for at least 5 minutes. It has a very complex aroma. I get some spice at first. White pepper, a little coriander/ Then loads of malt come across. Lots of date, fig, maybe a little pomegranate. Throughout there is just a hint of orange citrus. Its hard to tell if that is added, or if it is from the hops. The flavor has much of the malt character I detected in the nose. The figs, and dates are there, along with toffee. The spice comes midway with a bit more of the pepper, the coriander is a bit subdued. Mild bitterness on the finish accompanied by the orange. The mouth feel is smooth, slightly carbonated with just a slight alcohol warming. Very drinkable beer."
"This brew pours a murky brown color with enumerable floaties. The head is large and thick. Lacing is thorough, and leaves rings all the way down the glass. The aroma of spices, butter, creamy, caramel, and more spices. Very aromatic, and pleasing. The taste is all the aroma times ten. The aftertaste is full of lingering spices. The mouthfeel is beyond reproach; creamy, smooth, full bodied, lively carbonated. Overall, this is the best Belgian ale I have had to date, and one of the best beers period. The aroma, taste and feel all come together perfectly."
"A top beer. I feel blessed to have found it on tap. Many thanks to Toronado for tracking this down."
"The beer pours a cloudy dark brown color with a thick frothy offwhite head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is great! It has an intense malt scent that boasts of pale, roasted, and crystal malts along with loads of Belgian yeast aroma. It has a warm, roasted character that is fruity, but well balanced with the malts. The taste is awesome. This is one smooth beer, even at 10% alcohol. It's malty to the core with just enough spice and fruitiness the round out the taste. The mouthfeel is excellent. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is one awesome beer. I'm not the biggest Belgian beer fan, but I could drink this all day."
"Still, pretty delicious."
"This brewery is one of my favorite belgians and consistently produces a great product. Try their beers!"
"Beer is good. Happy Belgie beering."
"d: 10% alcohol? Wtf? Are you shitting me? Where is it? This is SO drinkable and flavorful I love it. One of my favorite belgians to date. Definately my favorite style now."
"This is one of the best beers I've had in a while, and I want to go get more. I think the 11.2 oz bottle is the perfect serving. I've seen some reviews for a bomber, but that would be way too much. I am one happy beer drinker"
"D - well balanced, sweet and bitter a great brew, easily downed for its ABV"
"A tea like appearance, with a mighty thick tan head. Plums and day old bananas, with hints of alcohol and caramel on the nose. Silky smooth and at the same time chewy, with a complex body. Alcohol soaked raisins, dark tingly fruits, figs and some tender smoky malts. As this beauty warms, vanilla and dark roasted coffee beans come to the forefront; a near spicy and juicy body. A somewhat pasty and milkshake like finish, yet this is a dandy offering. Incredible stuff."
"One of the smoothest drinking beers I've ever had. The bubbles are very unintrusive and unnoticable. Very sweet... in fact, I worry that a different batch could be too sweet. The sugars remained in my mouth long after the last sip. I'm looking forward to enjoying this a few times over the spring."
"Pours out a little head that falls into a very thin head that's almost gone. Very weak lacing that's barely noticeable. Smell is very sugary, like caramel. Kinda nice. The taste is very sweet, with dark fruit undertones. Mouthfeel is just fine, pretty good. I would drink this again, but it seems like I would like a newer beer and it would be even better."
"Dark brown color, with the perfect, loafy and creamy ""Belgian"" head. Rich and complex aroma, much more vibrant than previous bottles of the Grand Cru and Brune. Lightly peppery, spicy and herbaceous aromas (old hop pellets), which I attribute to hops, but I could be wrong. Scents of the attributes of Belgian yeast and dark malt are present as well, with hints of chocolate, plums, dark grapes, toffee and maple. The front palate begins with hints of burnt black currants, anise and a touch of cocoa beneath, which leads into the mid-palate, which is full of juicy bright red and dark fruits and light toffee. The finish is long and lingering, full of caramel flavors, while the alcohol makes its presence known throughout the flavor profile, but in a very subtle and elegant way. I like this beer, a lot. These Belgian beers just do it for me. I cant help it."
"Big thanks to HopasaurusRex for picking these up for me."
"11.2 ounce bottle , best before dating provided,lightly chilled and poured into a Belgian style chalice, first thing noted is a decent amount of floating sediment...pours dark honey amber, with a long lasting medium tan head, leaving respectable but not truly inspiring lacing. nose is of smokey melon and other ripe fruits. This is a complex and tasty elixir, notes of more melon, honey, yeast, bready malts soft and subtly in the background. I dont know how they hide this ones 10%, but I can pick up no alcohol notes. Pepper, smoke, more melon, vanilla, honey all picked on the final few sips. Mouthfeel is velvety and smoothly coating. Fine, fine brew, I'll need to pick up a large bottle of this tasty stuff next time, seek out and enjoy!"
"This one is a classic. I've had it on several occasions, but these notes are for the tap version which I sampled a few times some months ago at the Steelgaarden below the brew works in Bethlehem. This one is a cracked out triple sorta thing for sure. Dark rasiny/plum brune with a nice off-white head of foam that is big, bubbly, and lasting. Aromas are all brown sugar, a bit of maple, and tripley spices, as well as a nice clean maltiness and a light hoppiness to bring it all together. The taste is spicy and strong with the burnt brown/maple sugar flavors abounding on the buds. Mouthfeel is medium bodied to thick, and drinkability is very nice."
"Props to Faustgeist for sharing his!"
"thickly but not cloyingly sweet. smooth and slick with a nice balancing carbonation. malty and rich, sugary and sweet like canned fruits. drinkability hurt by the 10% and the sweetness, which wears out its welcome about halfway through the 750mL."
"Overall, a wonderful beer. Highly recommended. I can't wait to try more from this brewery."
"Thanks Cheezdawg! (04/18/10)"
"This is my fourth different beer I've had from this brewery and one thing is becoming apparent: while all the beers are somehow pretty similar, they're all VERY damn good."
"Great brew!"
"Slightly hazy toffee colour with a giant, dense, caramel head. There was plenty of big, clumpy lace throughout. Dark, dried fruits and yeast dominate the aroma, along with a bit of toffee. Caramel malt in the flavour, nice balance with some bready yeast. Chewy, fruity character here as well, along with mild spice in the finish. Smooth, rich texture. Another great beer from a superb brewery."
"Thanks DrJay!"
"Just freaking luscious."
"Had this one paired with pasta with alfredo sauce. The big boozy finish seemed to get in the way, though it did cleanse the palate of the cheese and cream. One hell of a mouthfeel with this beer."
"Lots of carbonation. Not overly thick, maybe a touch thin for the style. Drinkability is superb and I rarely give 5s for anything. This beer is crisp and refreshing and finishes very clean. I'm not a huge fan of Belgians, but this one ranks up there because of how easy it is to drink."
"Drinkability: I was surprised by this as I was expecting a tripel but this doesn't taste like any other tripel I have tasted; it also is not near as full-flavored as a Belgian Strong Dark as it lacks the dark fruit characteristics; this is a singular path that is a truly rewarding taste experience"
"A must try for fans of the Belgian big dark variety."
"D: I could literally drink this all night. At 10%, it is flat out INSANE how drinkable this beer is. Definitely gotta get the rents to bring me back some from Belgium."
"Overall: Pretty good, not as superlative as the brewery's Grand Cru, but a solid beer."
"This is a top notch representative of the strong dark belgian ale type, a little too much alcohol for my personal preference but is not overwhelming to the flavor. An excellent brew!"
"I could happily have a couple of these."
"Pours a very opaque brown color with a mountainous head of creamy beige foam. The smell is damn complex..dark fruits, spices, toffee malts and everything but the kitchen sink. Tastes heavenly..this Belgian is truly a masterpiece, and is always a good choice on draft if available. The 10% alcohol will keep you in check, but still very easy to drink for such a complex brew."
"Opinion: Wow! Now this is a complex beer! All you would need to do to one of these would be to sour it in Oak casks to make it absolutely decadent. It is a bit spicy, and this makes it a bit less drinkable, because even the burps taste like you just ate a spiced cookie. This is not objectionable, but it is a bit assertive at this time. This will be really nice to try in a couple years. I think Ill cellar my last bottle until its best before date of 2007. Check back with you later"
"Well, I've been sitting on this one a while, but finally broke down last night and drank the whole damn bottle myself. Huge thanks to LuckySevens82 for providing me with this one. Reviewed from detailed notes taken yesterday. Pours a three finger frothy caramel head over a dark amber (somewhat brownish) liquid with large flakes whirling around. Smells of alcohol, candi-sugar, caramel, toffee, hints of chocolate, bready, and just a touch of cherry sour. Tastes smooth creamy. Chocolate, caramel, yeast, and mild phenol. The aftertaste persists a long time with rising and falling caramel, toffee, coffee, and alcohol sting. This is a beer for times when you would like to ponder. I spent the whole evening sipping on this beer and contemplating the aftertaste. Pheonlic funk is minimal, but noticable. Not tremendouly funky...more of an edgy phenolic that's tempered quite well by caramel flavor and a dextrinous mouthfeel. Soured grain flavor, somewhat cherry upon the swallow. Like a caramel covered cherry. Md carbonation and md-thick to thick mouthfeel. Whoa, there was a bunch of yeasty flakes in that last pour from the bottle. Overall, this was an enjoyable beer that I was happy for the opportunity to try...but, I'd much rather have an Abbot 12 or Rochefort 10."
"Pours a somewhat murky brownish amber with a thick, lively tan head that retains very well, very nice. Aroma has a lot of sweet candied sugar notes, dark fruit , some toasted bread, some funky yeast character...pretty typical strong dark ale but with a bigger sweetness. The taste is instensely sweet also, with big dark candied sugar and molasses notes, toasted bread, funky yeast, and some mild alcohol notes. A descent beer, i liked it better than their grand cru but overall i havent been impressed with the des Rocs stuff."
"A nice drink on a cold winter night. A bit much like liquid fruitcake for regular consumption."
"Pours a hazy light brown with tremendous floaties all around. Head is prodigious and rocky, reducing to a steady centimeter collar. I just don't find this many floaties attractive. Tremendous yeast on the nose, cherries, raisins, plums and spice--and my nose is stuffed beyond belief. Rich full body complemented with perfect medium carbonation, creamy and palate coating(maybe the floaties are helping out here). Incredible malt depth. There's a continuous interplay of flavors on the tongue in no specific order. It's nutty, spicy, clove, cherry, apple, strong single malt scotch characteristics floating around too. Really quite amazing and while tremendously malty, never cloying or overly sweet at all. Dries in the finish with a spicy hops, almonds, coriander, black pepper and scotch. Simply incredible. There's so much here that i want to chew on it. 10% alcohol drinks like 5. Slight warming in the throat. Perhaps my favorite belgian yet, indeed I think I prefer this to westy 12."
"This is a complex beer, though it tasted primarily of rich malt, carmel, brown sugar and molasses, honey and spices(nutmeg,allspice) in the background. Cherry, fig, Full foamy pour, goes down easy and popular, on the high alcohol and very sweet side. A great brewery."
"Dark brown with ruby tones; fine suspended sediment; rocky resilient tan head. Smell is huge: super fruity, rich, caramel, very sweet like candy with raspberries and sweet potatoes. Mouthfeel is lighter than hoped. Taste was disappointing at first because so much smaller than the nose; but caught up, at warmer temperatures, with some rich, darker flavors like prunes and raisins. You can feel the warmer alcohol as you go on; drinkability is high, but this beer demands to be savored, with the rich flavors and the warming alcohol, so can't drink too quickly."
"Body is almost big, creamy, with a soft and velvety smooth mouthfeel. A real pleasure to sip. A 750 to myself is the perfect way to celebrate my 30th birthday."
"The mouthfeel is very thick and bubbly. The drinkability is off the heazy. Get some."
"The beer is quite dry up front, almost surprisingly so, but it quickly moves to a full sweet flavor that dominates the beer through to the finish. There is a nutty, almond note here, think of Amaretto, that really comes out with the sweetness. I also get hints of cherry, vanilla, toffee, caramel, clove. The finish has a light astringency to it that is quickly followed by a light bitterness that makes a faint attempt at balancing the sweetness. This beer is definitely quite rich, and actually has quite a similar flavor profile to the other beers I have had from this brewery. It is perhaps a bit too sweet though, which seems to drown out what might otherwise be a pretty complex beer. Though it is certainly is drinkable, almost as an after dinner desert."
"Poured into a Rapscallion glass, formed a 2"" tan head above the garnet brew. Head lasts incredibly well, and when it does start to recede, leaves heavy sparkling lace coating the sides. Aroma is tart dark fruits, with an unlying malt sweetness and some spiciness. Taste is not quite as pleasing as the nose to me, with the dark fruits almost seeming overripe, and the alcohol more pronounced, rather than lining up nicely with all the other flavors. Mouthfeel and drinkability are limited a bit by the flavors noted above, although for the style not totally out of line. Had high expectations, and was disappointed a bit here. Still worth your time though, for sure."
"This is gonna go down as one of my bigger disappointment beers ever. Poured a garnet brown in color with hardly any head. Light could penetrate when held up to a light source, but it would have difficulty piercing through. Nose was sickly sweet malty with some rpunes and figs. Flavor was not nearly as yeasty as I was expecting. It was kind of flat and dull. The malts came across as a bit too sweet and the fruit I picked up in the aroma came through as overripe. Picked up some cherries too which kind of saved this beer for me. Alcohol was also very nicely hidden. Mouthfeel was surprisingly lighter than I thought. However, my taste buds were kind of soured on this beer and I did not feel like order another."
"Well, the cork is gone under the cap in the large bottles...very dark clove brown color, shows big chunks typical of the brewery's beers lately (I have no problem with suspended yeast, the globs of protein and yeast seem excessive here and in others). Fat upcharging head of well over an inch, rocky and leaving plenty of attractive laces on the glass. Strong aroma, light alcohol, rummy molasses, and cling peaches. Mouthfeel is medium, carbonation follows suit, fairly smooth and somewhat creamy. Very fruit initially, lots of candied fruit in syrup, fortified wine, yeast. An accompanying dessert quality of baked rum and banana bread, cinnamon, mace, and decided ginger. There is some alcohol heat and the beer flattens to an apricot syrup as it hit the throat in the back. Yep, pretty impressive beer here, more drinkable than many somewhat dryer lighter-bodied examples."
"Very pleasurable experience as I watch the sun set and sip away the remains of the day."
"Mouthfeel was basically smooth with a light crispness at the start. The finish provided a slight tingle on the tongue. Superbly drinkable even though this slightly higher in alcohol. Worth seeking out."
"Very interesting from the first pour to the last sip. I enjoyed each aspect as it changed. Stop and linger with this one. The proper glass wear is listed on the back label, but try it colder than recommended and let it gradually warm and savor the changes it goes through."
"Drinkability: decent, but the alcohol kind made me not as keen for it as others of the style. Still, AdR's Triple Impériale is a good example of the style."
"Pours a medium to dark brown with a very tall head that has great retention and leaves tons of lacing on the glass. The head just won't fall. The aroma is all about the raisins. There's quite a bit of residual sweetness in the aroma as well. The flavor is quite sweet with tons of dark fruit flavors. Very interesting. Not as spicy as expected. Actually, the spicing is barely there. Quite tasty though. The body is thick and the drinkability is very good for the alcohol - the alcohol is barely detectable."
"11.2 oz bottle pours a cloudy dark reddish-brown with a lot of floating yeast particles that has a nice creamy light brown head that lasts and leaves sheets of lace in my glass. Spicy ginger bread, and dark fruit aromas, ginger bread, dark plums and spicy flavors, full bodied with a soft and creamy mouthfeel, finishes on the dry side. Wow this one is unbelievable, I will be buying more of this."
"Mouthfeel was quite good... lots of body. Drinkability was good... I would drink it again, although I wouldn't be able to have more than one bottle."
"Poured a hazy brown color with a small, off white head, that left light lacing on the glass. Aroma of malt, tart cherry and citrus, some orange peel, and light yeast. Taste was caramel, some butterscotch, citrus, yeast, and a good kick of alcohol. A very different tripel."
"Wow, what an utterly amazing drinking experience. Had a bottle mailed to me via liquidsolutions.com, brew date was listed as early 2004. Poured a blondish, reddish amber with a very nice head which had amazing retention. Also produced some of the best and most consistent lacing I've ever seen, certainly the best I've seen from a Belgian ale. Smell was of dark cherries, grapes, currants, a deep molasses, apples, fig, apricot, cinammon, a variety of spices I couldn't quite put my finger on more due to my lack of spice knowledge than anything, caramel, all completely distinguishable and yet not at all overpowering. Definitely one of the highlights of this brew was its virtually one-of-a-kind ability to maintain complexity AND mellowness, nothing at all was overpowering about this ale and yet it was likewise in no way underwhelming. This carried over from the aroma to the taste; slight grain, but mostly a wonderful cherry, molasses, apple spicy quality. Some hints of cocoa in there as well. Hoppy bitterness and some alcoholic quality showed through upon swallowing, again somehow completely balancing with all the other flavors for an incredible smoothness. Mouthfeel was a wonderful fizz due to the incredible bubble retention throughout the experience. A surpirsingly drinkable brew as well. Wow, just amazing."
"Drinkability: Wow! At $6.99 for a 1 pint 9.4 oz bottle, this one is a steal. One of the better Belgian tripels or strong dark ales that I can get my hands on. I liked this one much better than the brewery's Grand Cru. The Triple is creamy and smooth, and lacks the harsh notes that were sometimes apparent in the Grand Cru. An exceptional sipping experience!"
"Drinkality ad Overall: Ok smack me in the face and call me your bitch. This is the shit I've been looking for. I recieved this during BIF17 from a very generous BA in Florida. Whatan absolutely breath taking beer. One of the better beers that has ever come across my lips. Bings back memories of Westy 12 and Rochefort 10, and is damn near as good. This beer proves the word trappist doesn't mean shit. This is real beer."
"The mouthfeel is unexpectedly light and watery, but smooth as velvet. Has a sharp metallic taste to the foam. Overall I found this to be very unimpressive for a tripel, regardless of what my number rating comes out to be. I'll have to try a smaller (non-corked) bottle to see if maybe the seal on my cork was not airtight, affecting my decision. Either way, I was expecting much more from this beer, as I loved the Grand Cru, and this is very highly rated on BA. I might even go so far as to recommend staying away from this one if you're looking for a good tripel."
"Someone coyly asked me tonight if this brew, which I serve on draft at my bar, for the time being, was brewed by monks. No, sorry, it's brewed by guys who are free to do with their peters what they may. Let the demystification of Belgian-style beer commence, and let the burning of boundaries begin in earnest...this dark ""triple"" already gets it going in that direction!"
"Drinkability is good a triple I can enjoy not light and fruity but a dark Belgian ah life is good . For $7.00 a 750ml hard to beat this one a steal that eveyone needs to hunt down."
"Dark purple beauty...big off-white head...sticky lace. Smell is dark fruits and alcohol as I would expect from the style. The malty Belgian nose is brought to full fruition in the taste. Chewy malts over a Belgian candi base, but it seemed ""young""...there is a raw attitude with the alcohol that I haven't tasted in other dark ales. Mouthfeel is medium to full...the chewiness aiding this. Easy to drink and reasonably priced. Certainly recommended."
"Drinkability is just all right. The flavor is good and slightly rich but with little for the nose and the watery feel I don't think that is enough to carry it into the ranks of the good triples."
"This Belgian Special Dark Ale was purchased in a 330 ml brown bottle with a best by date of 2007. The beer poured cloudy reddish amber with a three finger tall foamy head that refused to die. The nose was subtly spicy (pepper, saffron), and fruity (apples, pears) with a tinge of earthy yeast, which was hard to keep in the little bottle. The taste was a revelation of lightly sweet and sour fruit flavors with a good deal of spiciness and some woody and herbal bitterness. The body felt oh-so-light and airy, and there was no hint at all of the 10% ABV. In the blink of an eye the glass was empty. Next time I am definitely going to buy the big bottle."
"One of my last ""best before 2007"" bottles. It ages well as expected, though it suffers from the Des Rocs yeast coagulation and requires a careful hand with the pour. Sherry and brown sugar surge upward, and the brighter tropical notes are suppressed. Figs and molasses, with drier walnut nuttiness. This is a malt bath that hasn't radically changed since it was fresh and could easily go another 5-10 yeast. The foil was blown on my bottle, prompting an unfounded fear that the cork had failed."
"My third of these great green bottles, capped and corked (they are a little tougher to get into, but well worth it). Dark maroon body, with a light haziness, head is huge and foamy. Toffee, fig, raisin, light alcohol, dark fruits, belgian yeast, and even more toffee are present in the nose. Taste is sweet and smooth, complex with many flavors that cross over from the smell. Alcohol is extremely well hidden under a pile of shifting flavors, gives this a wine/rum flavor that is very enjoyable. A smooth drinker , for sure. These beer is fantastic. I can only find a flaw in the barely noticable suspended particles in the beer."
"750 ml bottle. Dark reddish brown with suspended chunks of white and gray. The head is big and creamy looking. Complex aroma of caramel, toffee, figs, and raisins. Starts out very sweet with caramel and dark, rotting fruit. Finished with spices, especially black pepper. Mouthfeel is amazing, so smooth and creamy. Drinkability is also incredible. How could this be 10% abv? There is almost no noticable alcohol at all. I could have gone for another 750 ml bottle. Great beer."
"I have heard tale that the 750s are much better, will have to try one of those for the comparison"
"Gee wilikers Batman! This must be on of the best values out there. For $8 a bottle, this is a steal. Complexities are found deep within, giving an endless array of flavors for you mind to contemplate. Sip, enjoy, go comatose, wake up, and repeat...always repeat."
"A rich desesrt with enough body to fill you up like a full dinner course. The color is this unfiltered golden, copper-brown mixture that has to be seen. The head is nice and consist with a big Belgian ale. The taste is a sweet fruity concoction with a hint of carmel sugar and milk choclate. The notice of hops is faint in the back of the mouth. The aroma is candy sweet; much like a french choclate dessert. The alcohol is hidden away so far that it never dawns on you how strong the brew is until its gone and your smiling. I suggest to anyone to buy a 4-pack and enjoy separately."
"*daniel"
"Drinkability- I think I will need to re-try St. Bernadrus tripel. This one may take the cake. I haven't had Westy 8 yet, but I have a feeling that it may resemble or possibly be better than this. Although, this was pretty damn incredible. Will be one of my ""12"" beers I take on my honeymoon in September."
"Pours a dark crimsonish brown color. Really frothy tans head appears as it is poured into my chalice. Smells very yeasty. Yeasty, dark sweet fruit, spices. A wonderful smelling dark belgian ale. Flavors are wonderful. Sweet brown sugarish taste, plums and raisins among other fruits, spices, maybe yeasty or otherwise. Really one of the best tasting belgian brews I have had. Slight alcohol aftertaste, but not in a bad way at all. This is a top notch belgian that I could drink many of. A+ for this one."
"From notes. The beer poured a dark rubied brown color with a 3 finger head that fell slowly and stuck around well. The nose was very extreme and intense. I got notes of vinous grapes, brown sugar, apple rinds, spiceyness and puffs of alcohol. The flavor was brown sugar coated raisins, but not overly sweet...just enough. This fades to a slightly rapey fruityness with a very nice spiceyness. The feel was thick with a moderate carbonation and slightly coating in my mouth. Overall, I found this brew to be divine. The great flavors melded well together, the feel was great, and just all out dangerous at 10%. I will be gettng another bottle of this."
"Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy with a good mellow carbonation. So easy to drink and quite a treat. I will be waiting patiently for the next time I'll be able to sample this brew. Definetly recommended. Go. Buy. Drink."
"This is a real treat. Due to it's sweetness, it's an excellent dessert beer, but one bottle is probably enough. I'm not to hip on the things floating around in it, so just close your eyes. There is a pervasive saccharin sweetness that is a bit off-putting and challenges me to finish the bottle, but otherwise, it's a damn fine brew. Recommended."
"Drinkability is very high. Real Belgian treat. This brewery continues to amaze. Seek this out and try. Let it warm a bit, no nearly as good when at all cold."
"Pours a medium murky brown with a big fluffy headthat settles quite fast not leaving much lace behind,awesome aromas of almond,cinnamon,and juicy orange really woke up the sences.Alot of dark fruit going on flavor wise some plum and raisin are very prevelant along with some cinnamon and maybe a touch of nutmeg with a nice lingering yeasty finish.Glad to have the opportunity to try this very complex and enjoyable will seek out again for sure."
"Mouthfeel is rich and full- an end of night enjoyment. I was really sad when the glass was empty."
"Big full body, lush, rich, tender, fruity and spicy, oily in some respects closer to the leftover finishing characteristics. Very actively full from start to finish. Boisterously so. A truly enjoyable sipper. Take your time with this one, its worth it. Extravagantly fantastic stuff!"
"Drinkability: 10%? You gotta be kidding. No signs whatsoever of EtOH. Not only does this beer pack a punch, but it's undetectable and very flavorful as well. A dangerous combo. This one is a marvel."
"It has been a while since Ive had a wine cork and this one let out a nice pop. Dark and luscious, this beer looked and smelled great. It tasted just like it smelled and looked  rich, thick sweet and boozy. Rich honey wine maltiness with hints of coriander and orange peel. The taste just lingers on your tongue and palate as the alcohol warms your chest. The sweetness is bordering on being too much but the high gravity and silkiness make it ok. This may need some aging or some food to balance the sweetness. God bless the Belgians."
"Highly recommended for sure!"
"Sticking and jostling full-bodied pillow plume of light mocha carbonation that settles to about ¼-inch for the whole pour. Deep ruby to lightly brown hue with generous floaters and a good amount of action. Very vinous on the nose, somewhat vinegary, along with some sweet chocolate and roasted touches. On the mouth some toffee and caramel notes jump through, but they seem to be overwhelmed by some sweet and sour alcohol notes that are, in a way, disconcerting. With the floaters, despite a careful pour, I would not get another, unless perhaps from the source."
"750 ml green bottle capped and corked. Best before 2006 on back label. The aroma on this beer was phenomenal, but a 5 is as high as we can rate it. If the taste had followed suit this could have been the highest beer I ever rated, but it just couldn't stand up to the pressure."
"Reddish-brown in color with a thick, creamy tan head. It leaves a large amount of lacing. A nice looking brew. The aroma is yeasty and malty with cookie dough. It is also full of raisins and dates in the nose, and also a bit of rum cake. The flavor is malty sweet with candi sugar and brown sugar. It is plummy and bready in the flavor as well. It is medium bodied and highly drinkable for its strength. It is very sweet and tasty. A top notch brew that I will definitely seek out again."
"Very foamy thick fully laced rocky and frothy goodness tops the muddy brown body among which abounds yeast chunks. Typical Abbaye des Rocs nose, explosive malts and yeast, plenty of jammy fruit esters and spicy hints (thyme, herbs). Appealing pecan pie, caramel and grapey complexity of the regular Des Rocs with a hefty dose of strawberries. Spicy and very sweet flavor profile, fruit pie, strong cloves. Has a definite christmas feel to it. Id perhaps prefer a bit more hops to clean the sweetness a bit, but this is very good, if a bit cloying. Very smooth and comfortable medium body, maybe a bit thinner than the original. Okay, I dont get the purpose of this beer that has characteristics from both the grand cru and regular, but loving the other 2, I can only enjoy this one."
"Fortuitously found on a recent trip to a recently discovered liquor store, it comes in the standard issue 750 ml bottle we know and love. It pours deep reddish brown with a thick tan head. Little bits of yeast can be seen even with a careful pour. The smell is near paradise: loads of dark ripe fruit, some spice, and that wonderful smell of Belgian yeast. The smell is reminscent of a nice port. Unbelievably it tastes even better than it smells. The mouthfeel is a silky and creamy as it gets. Drinkability? It's too easy to forget this stuff is 10% abv. This is another stellar offering from the good people at des Rocs."
"Drinkability: Sure, I'll have a another. I don't mind if I do. Chop chop love, get me another!"
"HIGHLY Recommended, sell your Mother to get this."
"EDIT: not nearly as good in the 12oz. bottles, but still excellent. i'd give it a straight 4.0 in the small size."
"Drinkability  And to think I was going to have chili dogs for dinner. This really is a meal unto itself. It is so soft and easy that you almost forget how big it is. What a treat."
"This beer appears to be a fairly new offering from them. It poured a cloudy dark red amber color with quite a bit of sediment present. It formed a bubbly off white head that coated the glass with lace as it subsided. Some carbonation is present, peeking through the sediment. An aroma of malt, banana, caramel and candy with some spices. The flavor was malt, caramel and spices. The finish was creamy and a touch sweet. A nice new addition to their beers."
