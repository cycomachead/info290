"o: sweet, rich, complex, such a wonderful brew.  be sure to let this warm up before you drink it.  often available at the LCBO at a very affordable $3.50/bottle which is great too"

""
""
"O - A really nice BDA on the lighter side of the style with great versatility when it comes to food."
""
""
""
"I will admit that I am not a huge fan of the Belgian Strong Dark Ale style, but this was a very complex beer and I enjoyed it."
"So much better than the 6. Very tasty even if it isn't my preferred style."

"3/15/15 (Bottle) -  Very nice dark brown pour, nice tan head, very thick texture. Nice fruit and caramel aroma, intense toasted malt smells . Excellent tasting beer, nice kick while drinking. I still prefer the 10 to this 8, but these are among the top few beers I've ever had. Highly recommended!!!"
"Two fingers worth of vibrant lively lop-sided light khaki colored crisp fizzy froth...  Really good retention gives way to a lush slightly creamy thick veil of lacing...  The color is a murky light-to-medium brown...  Loads of quickly paced micro bubbled carbonation streaks rise throughout...  In addition, a bunch of medium to large side carbonation bubbles cling to the sides of the glass...  Effervescent...    The nose is highlighted by loads upon loads of sweet dark fruits...  Cherries...  Figs...  Plums...  Raisins...  Some brown sugar...  Light Belgian yeast notes...  Faint notes of vanilla as well...  A very subtle booziness...  World class aroma...  The palate is a slightly more muddled version of the aroma...  The brown sugar is a bit more pronounced and the dark fruits recede a tiny bit...  There's also the addition of smoke and tobacco on the finish...  Medium bodied... Sturdy...  Loads of prickly carbonation to start before turning much more soft and delicate...  A bit of a chalky finish...  A really really good Belgian Strong Dark Ale, but a bit shy of the world class offering that I was expecting..."
"My favorite trappist to- date. The 10 brings too much ""tart"" while the 6 doesn't seem to be enough flavor. At ~ $5 a bottle... hard to not move on to other great beers, but a great treat to offer a friend out of a frosty goblet... and at 9.2%... you don't need to drink to many to feel content."
"In comparison, this beer is miles ahead of Rochefort 6 and only a notch below the 10.  A classic beer that I somehow had not tried until now. Recommended to anyone who loves Trappist beers."
""
"Really good. I enjoy Trappist Belgians and this is a great example of the style"
"Tastes just like it smells .  Alcohol is present at the end of the swallow. Mouth feel is medium-full and satisfying. Fantastic!"
"It's pretty good. A lot of hype for no reason, though."
""
"Overall: It's good. Not great, merely good - there are other beers in the Rochefort repertoire that are, IMO, far better. Not to say that this isn't worth trying though, it most definitely is."
"Fairly strong ethanol aroma on the glass I had, but very smooth feel with a primarily malt caramel flavor.  Not too overwhelming or spicey which you find sometimes with the style but not as complex as I thought it would be, mostly raisin & varying light toasted malt"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I am neutral on this beer."
"O: As close to perfect as it gets. A captivating beer in all respects. Ponder its complexity sip by sip for a most rewarding experience. By far my favorite in the Rochefort lineup, though the 10 seems to overshadow it in popular opinion."

"330ml bottle poured into tulip. Appearance is hazy iced tea brown with red highlights. One finger head quickly fades to a ring. Bit of a bubble show with sediment resting on the bottom. Aroma is raisin, vanilla, fig, alcohol, light molasses, and grains. Taste is sweet malt and yeast with mild clove phenol, pumpernickel bread, brown sugar, and fig. Alcohol is prominent with fruit and spice notes. Medium-plus body, creamy texture, fizzy carbonation, spicy and sweet finish."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Very strong beer. But not bad taste"
""
""
""
""
"O: Another super solid offering from this brewery. I really enjoyed 6, and this one as well, but for different reasons. It's simple, fruit and booze in a well balanced presentation. Very well done and worth the price of admission. "
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I was very excited to try this and very disappointed. Looks great in the glass, tastes bland. No complexity at all. I will try one more to see if this is a dud."
""
"Kept at fridge temp until ready to drink but improves greatly as nears room temp. Would recommend letting it sit for 20 minutes or so before starting. This is a near prefect example of its style. Complex esters and dark belgian dried fruit flavor. No raisin which is a plus. EtOH taste is masked by malt flavors. Very little if any hop flavor or aroma. Slightly too carbonated for my taste, but this improves as it is left out warming up. Will buy again and again."
""
""
""
"Overall - A nice smelling, crisp tasting  Belgian, with a full carbonation, and snappy mouth feel."
"I let this one warm for a bit from the fridge before opening, to maximize the tastes, which echo the aromas.  There is a fairly thick mouthfeel,with a slight viscosity as it glides over the tongue.  It's highly complex, and keeps adding to its repertoire with each sip. Definitely some alcohol presence entering the mix.  Now getting some sweet nuttiness, and prune juice.  I would compare this to the best bread puddings I have had, contained in a glass.  A simply wonderful World Class beer."
"Very refreshing drink to have right after work."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a amber color with a 1 1/2 off white head spotty lacing. Great aroma and taste of malt, yeast, caramel and plum. Great carbonation in mouthfeel well balanced."
"O: Very impressed, really complex, so much going on, lots of carbonation, creamy mouthfeel, did not expect this will definitely have to try 6 and 10, and some more Belgian ales."
""
""
""
""
"Pours to a dark rich color, lots of head that could be to my pouring. Low retention on the head. Slight aroma. Taste is deep, rich and flavorful, has kind of a sweet finish on it. Surprisingly the alcohol is barely noticeable for being a 9%. Very smooth to drink. Overall I can see myself purchasing again."
""
""
"very nice and smooth. alot of head"
""

""
""
""

"Suprisingly mild for such a high ABV.  Mixed six from Uncle Mike."
""
""
""
""
""
"Deep brown almost burnt peach color. The head poured a little thick (probably my fault). I was surprised it didn't have a stronger aroma, but I distinctly smelled a sweet peach. The taste, well, the taste. Exquisite, subtle, yet rich.  Hint of vanilla and a strong fruity taste (not citrusy). Just a pleasurable drinking experience."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - This is really good and deserves its world class rating. Might be as good as the 10. Can't wait to buy more."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a great beer.  I would like to compare the 10 and 8 side by side.  I think I might like the 8 better."
""
"Extremely good, I do recommend this beer"
""
""
""
""
""

"Strong carbonation, 6 is much better"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured a cloudy brown with medium-coarse bubbles; the head dissipated quickly. The mouthfeel followed: The lively, coarse carbonation was almost objectionable, and the body was a bit thinner than expected. The taste is wonderful, though: malty, sweet fruit (dried dark fruit) with little hops presence. Will look forward to trying this again to see if my perception of the body & carbonation change."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is the standard upon which every Trappist and Trappist wannabe should be judged. There most completely drinkable yet complex brew that I've tasted yet. Please, Unibroue: release something like this (Maudite doesn't compare) so I don't have to pay $6/bottle!"

"Final Thoughts: The Trappist monks seldom disappoint, and this one is certainly no exception. This is currently my highest ranked Trappist Beer and my 3rd highest rated beer as of the time of this review. I can't say enough good things about it, and you owe it to yourself to track this down and try. Two thumbs and two big toes up!"
""
""
"Possibly got faulty bottles."
""
""
"O:very good though to any of those trying it I would say, ice cold is not best, I think it probably softens your ability to perceive some of the more subtle flavors"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Bottle from Maltitude. Pours brown with white head. Aroma of chocolate, vanilla, malt. Taste of vanilla, spices, and a slight hint of chocolate. A wonderful Trappist beer. Awesome beer and maybe my new favorite Trappist."

"O: Great beer, now I'm interested to grab a few more from the same batch to follow as they age"
""
""
""
""
"330ml bottle poured into a tulip glass. Color is a dark rusty brown. Light test yields a dark caramelesque color. Pours with a bit over 2 fingers of head which slowly settles into a thin ring of foam. Smells very malty and of dark fruits with a lingering hint of alcohol. Initial taste is very malty with strong spices and the same dark fruits. The alcohol is detectable but less noticable than the smell led on. Very good overall."
""
""
"mild easy drinking, smooth malt body, no bitterness really, Belgium spices, slight alcohol taste  (8/10)"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - This beer taste great! The combination of bread, sweet, bitter, and spice is both unique and amazing. I could chug multiple Rochefort 8s if it weren't for the high alcohol content and even higher cost."

"O- a great example of the style!"

"Pours a murky pond like raisin brown. Some sediment slowly settles to the bottom. 1 finger of light tan head then settles to a thin film. Scent is of dark fruit, raisons, plums, prunes, cherries and figs with light spices and alcohol esters. Taste follows the scent with dark alcohol soaked fruit, christmas spices, brown sugar and alcohol esters. Snappy carbonation makes this go down faster than you would expect. Delicious."
""
""
""
""
"In the interest of full disclosure I love strong dark ales of most every stripe. This is no exception, although I must say slightly drier than I had anticipated. The malts are still very much front and center, taste a bit like the other famous abbey product the fruit cake, but it is balanced by a a slight bitterness and the aforementioned dryness. When cold the high carbonation makes for a very refreshing sensation, as the brew warms the more caramel notes come to the forefront. There is little alcohol character, a truly dangerous trait in a beer this tasty. Complex and lovely."
""
""
""
"O- this is one of those beers that just grows in complexity the longer you drink it.  A standard setting beer of the style and one that is to be savored"

"Pours mahogany brown and cloudy (but I decanted a bit of the sediment), with a tall, bubbly tan head with not much lacing.  The nose is nice and big with lots of sweet roasted malt, raisins, brown sugar and candi sugar.  The taste is very similar with a big emphasis on on the malt profile and brown sugar.  The body felt lighter than expected/wanted with a bit too much carbonation.  A tasty beer, but not as full as I thought it was going to be."
"O: When it is poured into the correct glass does not have a large head but if you use the wrong type of glass then you end up with a 5th of a glass of beer and the rest head which takes an age to die down (to see what glass to use check the bottle). The first sip has a nip of alcohol but it is not over powering and there is a slight bitter sweet taste to it so that it is a very pleasing beer. But be warned this is a strong drink and should not be taken lightly. I like to think of this as the thinking man’s special brew. It also has bubbles so this one tingles on the tongue."

"perfectly mature beer for ""the lad""."
"Poured from bottle.  Aroma of fruit.  Appearance is a very dark brown with significant tan head.  Medium bitter taste with a dry finish.  A really great Belgian Strong Ale."
""
""
""
""
"O: Between the mid evil scenery, the perfect weather and the fresh beer..  once I was not a fan of this beer this one really hit the spot. The Abbey this came from was forgettable and the monks don't let you see much so it can be skipped. But the Roch 8 is the best in their 3 beer line up in my opinion."
""
""
""
""

""

"Dark caramel brown, hazy. Big off white head, recess fast, some lacing. Dark fruits, sweet malts.  Spicy, earthy flavor.  Licorice. It's Belgian and good."

"Pour from 330 into tulip. Head flew up and over pretty big, but dissipated very quickly. Fig, raisin, other dried fruits  in aroma. But the taste was much more complex. Spicy, earthy, and the candy sugar taste gave the sense of licorice. I think that was the off-putting aspect for me. I spent the rest of the glass trying to focus on isolating aspects of the complexity - there are notes of malt to savor, notes of yeast to savor, hops to savor. But the licorice profile kept dominating. Got in my head and I couldn't get it out."

"Overall: This was my first beer from Brasserie de Rochefort, and while I'm not absolutely blown away, I'm thoroughly impressed. I'll definitely be trying the Rochefort 6 and 10. Complex, interesting, and most importantly, delicious."

"O - Very nice example of the strong dark ale style. Sweet initially, but finishes dry - I could far too much of this. This beer is living on the edge as far as noticeable alcohol goes, it works because the alcohol is on the clean and warm side. I personally prefer the alcohol to be even more in the background - but this is nevertheless an awesome beer."

"Rochefort 8 pours a dark amber color with a nice large lacing and frothy head.  There is a mellow aroma toasted, and hints of sweetness.  The taste has mellow toasted flavor, nice mellow and balanced sweetness.  Great body, great feel.  Overall its very well balanced, and perfectly put together."
""
""
""
""
""
"Smooth rich flavor, nothing overpowering."
""
""
"Overall: One of the greatest beers this world has to offer.  The first time I had this it sent me in to a long belgian phase, yet none lived up to the brilliance of this brew.  The dark fruits are simply unrivaled, and the spiced notes are so balanced yet potent on the palate.  Truly wonderful."

"Thick two finger head, lightish brown color and slight lacing patterns. Aroma of fig, raisin, and plum, with a fair amount of yeasty funk. Tastes of dried fruit with a bit of caramel and bread, also something like vanilla and the slightest touch of mulled spice and anise. A fair amount of effervescence in a medium body that leaves a a slight spicy note on the tongue. Very satisfied with this, a great step from the 10!"

"O: being not a fan of the Belgium darks I have been avoiding them for quite some time. This was my entry back into the style. It's perfectly balanced, majorly complex, and very well crafted."
"O: As expected, not as good as the 10. But still better than most other beers. Thick, hearty, malty, powerful and wonderfully balanced. A+."

"Great ester character is balanced nicely by the malt. The carbonation is higher than I'd like, and a phenolic alcohol character emerges as it warms. Wanted to like this more, but the carbonation killed it for me."

"330 ml bottle. Pours hazy amber with tall, long-lasting, foamy off-white head and nice lacing. Aroma is of bready malt, caramel, barnyard yeast and fruity esters. Body is full and crisp. Spicy yeast, caramel malt, plums, raisins, brown sugar fill the mouth. Finish is long and spicy. Great brew."

"O: Not as arcane-tasting as the 10, but nearly perfect in its own right! A great beer for any fans of the style. I'll definitely buy again!"
"Chestnut brown in color; opaque, Gigantic head; though it dies out entirely relatively fast. Nice faint smell; slightly sweet and grainy. Sweet, grainy full taste with a slightly dry finish. Definitely full of flavor. Medium body. Nice, light carbonation. Very good Belgium beer; though I think I prefer the 6 over the 8."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"For info: My Belgian buddies (who prefer the Rochefort 10), say to check the date on the Rochefort bottle ... it always shows a date 5 years after it was created. The closer you are to that end date the better, they reckon. Mine still shows almost 5 years from now, beer was still superb."

""
"reminded me of St Bernardus abt 12."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A rich, complex ale. Like other beers of the style it’s hefty, sweet, and malty. However with Rochefort 8 there’s more of a drying touch that brings forth more of the flavors, and that’s what sets it apart in my mind. Also, the nice floral alcohol is deceptive and pleasant. Curious about what would happen to this with some age. Went really well with some Cookies and Cream ice cream."
""
"Overall, just fantastic. It's been a long time since I last had the 10, and I know it's a different beer than the 8, but I think I might prefer this one. Rich and sweet, but not overpoweringly so or cloying. Lots of flavors at play, but it doesn't seem muddled at all. I love the fact that it's so easy to get as well. Proof positive that something doesn't have to be impossible to obtain to be outstanding."

"BBD 9/27/17. Pours a very hazy dark amber with a slight reddish tint. Massive head and lacing that retains well. The nose is subdued, but of dates/figs, dark malt and Belgian yeast. The body is on the heavy side of medium with a nice slick mouthfeel. Normal carbonation level with a touch of effervescence on the finish. The wonderful flavor profile is quite complex, yet balanced. It begins with a multitude of dark fruit flavors - fig, date, raisin, plum - then flows to a mild malt sweetness over a well subdued alcohol phenolic note. The finish is smooth, yet also almost clean. A slight residual alcohol burn with associated phenolics linger a bit. This is the best Belgian I've ever had."

"330ml bottle. Westmalle Chalice glass. Dark brown, deep ruby tints to the light. Hazy appearance. Beige foam creates a cottony & lasting crown. Copious lacing rings on sides. Belgian yeast & toasted malts to the nose as well as dark fruits-prune, raisin & cherry hues. Flavors as expected from aroma profile completed by woody notes & kind sugary warm sensation. Medium body. Soft carbonation. Voluptuous & flavorful palate. Fruits & gentle heat mixed with a very low bitterness linger into a long finish. One of my favourite Trappists. Complex & Great !!!"

"Verdict: A really enjoyable beer and one of the benchmarks for the style. The body is a little livelier than what I'd prefer and the balance could use some improvement, especially with their masterclass of a beer in Rochefort 10. Definitely one to savor and enjoy, a great beer during the colder winter months."

"The middle of the Rochefort pack, poured into a Chimay goblet from the classic bottle. Sources describe this beer as dominated by dark fruit and on the cake-like, spicy side. I largely agree with this assessment. This brew is a dark reddish honey color, lighter than I expected, with a huge amount of pale tan head. These Trappist brews seem to bring the bubbles, bottle conditioning being par for the course. Initially the aroma is fresh fruit, like purple grapes, quickly followed by spicy yeast that recalls cloves predominantly, brown bread crust, and sweet dried fruits ... Palate is a cornucopia of dark fruit flavors, fig newton cookies and raisins, brown bread, rummy dark sugar, quite rich and sweet but with an earthy, woody, tannic finish that reminds me of strong black tea and rhubarb. The high level of carbonation and medium body mean this drinks like a less flavorful beer than it truly is. What really stands out here are the spicy esters ... Black pepper and a lot of what tastes like fresh cinnamon. The cinnamon effect builds as you go. Cake-like indeed. Fantastic stuff, and I maintain that Rochefort is king of the Trappists ... Or perhaps Pope? Hmmm."
""
""
""
"This is been my favorite Belgian brew for several years now. It's just so balanced through and through. The smell hits you with ripe grapes and then it turns into pear. The malt smell carries you right to the malty taste, which then opens into a ripe fruit mix. There is a big spiciness that follows the whole drink. I will definitely continue to get this."
"Mais um genial rótulo da Rochefort."

"Overall 4.0: Outstanding beer. The taste levels, the bouquet, the mouthfeel all combine to make this a brew worth tracking down. These Belgian Darks I have been reviewing all represent many hundreds of years of brewing acumen and this lovely brew is no exception. This beer would be excellent for sessioning or simply savoring in fron of a roaring fire. Recommended."

"A hardy looking hazy hazelnut amber colored brew with a muscular off-white head that settles just slightly to a finger thick blanket with generous lacing. Just terrific looking stuff. The nose picks up delicate but sure juniper berries with hints of orange peel and slight lemon grass and tastefully sweet malt. Enjoyable. The palate appreciates gin-like flavors right away through a medium-light body and the crisp feel of fairly aggressive but smooth, tiny bubbled carbonation. As it warms the warmer flavors emerge with pleasant caramel malt and grassy edges. Paired with the cheese of your choice this really becomes really special and so smooth."

"Pours an amber brown with a frothy and thick head, decent retention but not as good as a Belgian should be. Aroma has dark fruits, figs, bit musty. Carbonation is too high and affects the flavor and feel. Some dried fruits, tingle of spices. A shame because i love Rochefort but this one was a bit too carbonated. Will revisit for sure."
""
""
""

"Final Grade: 4.53, a fantastic A grade. What is there to say? Rochefort 8 has absurdly high aggregate scores for a good reason - it's a ridiculously well-made Belgian dark ale. In a pinch I might take Chimay Blue over this one, but I'd need to do a side-by-side comparison to come to any fair conclusion, because the fact of the matter is they're both world-class beers. This is a beer that no self-respecting BA should neglect to try. I'll definitely be picking up a few more bottles of this for the cellar."

"RJT"
"O- I am extremely impressed with this one. Rochefort 10 was not my cup of tea, it was a little too boozy for me, but I think this one is exactly what a Belgian strong dark ale should be. It's nice getting blown away by something you do not expect every now and then and this one did the trick."

"T: Opens on the sweeter side with some toasted brown sugar, toffee, molasses and candi sugar. Then moves to some clove, bread crust, doughy malt and baking spices. Finishes with some bittersweet cocoa, roasted malt and just a touch of alcohol. Nice."
""
""
""
"From my tasting notes: This is a step down from their 10, but it was still phenomenal. It poured an opaque brown with a decent head and lots of spices, sweet malts, and caramel in the aroma. The taste was deep and complex, while not as intense as its bigger brother it was still big and bold. The 8 is still ranked as one of the best beers in the world and it was mmm mmm good."

"Just a first rate Belgian in every way. Wonderful smell, and unlike so many beers, the taste matches up to the smell. The alcohol is well-hidden, but the mouthfeel encourages you to sip and savor. This beer would be the top-shelf flagship offering of almost any other brewer, but amazingly it runs a close second in its own house to Rochefort 10."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a rich brown color with fizzy, soda-like head that dissipates quickly. The smell is spicy yeast with big plum notes, raisins, cherries, candied sugar, and bready malt. The first thing that struck me when I tasted it was the blistering amount of carbonation. After holding in your mouth for a bit, the beer will PRY OPEN all of your taste buds, delivering a flavor profile of candied sugar, caramel, and dark fruit. I also get a lot of the bread malts in the aftertaste. It's a more artfully crafted beer than most but I think Rochefort 10 topples it."
"We had it with blue Chimay and Gulden Draak, and it was the most complex one. Dark brown, almost black in colour, dark and dried fruits on the nose and palate, pleasant bitterness in the aftertaste. It deserves to be on the top of the list of this beer style, right there with blue Chimay. Don't drink it cold!"
""
""
"Pours a murky brown with some sediment and a big light tan head that fades very slowly. Smell is dark fruit, some spice, a little malty and bready. Taste is like the nose, dark fruits and malty sweetness. Medium body with good carbonation. Overall a good beer."
""

"Overall - just a terrific beer! I'm not a huge fan of this style and therefore my ratings reflect that, however, it is an enjoyable brew!"

"It has great taste which I hate to say taste almost like communion wine (Catholics and orthodox's will understand) but has that Belgian ale essence. It is fairly thick when sipped but goes down smooth. It has a bit of a sweet taste to it and not a very over powering after taste."

"Wow, this is good is what goes through my mind. This is one great beer, a lot of flavor, with nothing dominating, balanced well. No doubt that this is a big and serious beer, and does everything well. I could drink this all day, although the abv makes that impossible. Well worth trying, a must have."
""

"o: A fine brew and a worthy companion to 10. Not sure I'd buy it again, though, at $6 a pop. Too many $1 to $2 brews I like almost as much. But of course hardly any of them are 9%+ ABV."
""
"O: This is a pretty big, complex beer that is still smoother than I expected in a beer with 9.2% ABV. I can't wait to try it's big brother #10."

"I've had it a few times before, but never realized just how good it was."

""
""
""
"330mL. Pours a hazy dark brown with some yeast sediment and a giant, thick, off-white head that dwindles down. Aroma is Belgian estery yeast, mild alcohol, clove/nutmeg. Taste has a lot of brown sugar, dark cherry, spice medley, and warming alcohol. Dense mouthfeel with warming, brown alcohol finish."
""
""
""

""

"Coffee, some sort of fruit, and drinkability that totally belies its 9.2 % abv. Mellow, only very slightly bitter."

"O: This is a very good beer. The flavor really sticks with you so it's one you can enjoy it for a long time. I haven't had many Belgian Strong Ales that I could compare it to, but I'm glad I could enjoy one of the best."

"To me this is the benchmark for all beers. Nothing else compares to this beer. Tastes of banana bread, and molasses. This beer to me is like candy in a bottle. Just the right amount of taste, and flavor that just rolls on my tongue. This definitely is in a class all by itself. A man among boys!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- An absolutely delicious beer, definitely more of a sipper than anything else. And while many beers do have recommended serving temperatures, in most cases I have found that the difference between a cold beer and a slightly warmer beer is small. However, in the case of Rochefort 8, the difference is large, and I would recommend that consumption take place after letting the beer warm for some time."

"O: Being very biased towards malty brews I was reallt into this. I had no idea what to expect and it is the most unique beer to date. The prune juice thing was a big surprise but it works. Would have liked for the head to stick around a while but it just went flat. I wish I had more than 33cl but at 9.2% it's probably best I didn't. Plan on sipping this with a rich meal."

"Reviewed: 3/19/07"
"A: Overflow of carbonation, thick rocky head, bronze in color -4.00, S: Some spicy aromas, mild esters, hint of butterscotch and pear, wonderful fruit aromas with some mild figs and green apple – 5.00, T: Raisins and dry malts, noticeable alcohol burn, dry and chalky, palate is good but doesn’t match the complexity of the nose – still wonderful – 4.00, M: Quite prickly with a very dry end – 3.75, D: Nice sipping beer, the nose really carries the beer – 3.50"
"Saw this at the local LCBO at $2.55 a pop...never saw this stuff so cheap so I picked up a pair. After letting it warm a bit I poured it reverently into my La Trappe goblet, raising a rich rocky tan head that sat atop cloudy brownish liquid tinged with amber ( I like to swirl and pour the yeast all in one motion) The aroma is of raisins, brown sugar and spicy yeast...a wonderful perfume. First sip coats the mouth with flavors of bread, raisins, and a great balance of malty sweetness with a firm but not assertive hoppiness...this is a very complex ale as are all the Trappist beers, a joy to sip and 'deconstruct' flavor-wise. The alcohol is noticeable as it warms but that's not deterring my enjoyment of this at all...very warming and satisfying, finishes on a bittersweet note, this one is hard NOT to just drink is a hurry but is so worth the patience as every sip is enjoyed to the fullest. Classic, delicious and world class."

"A: Pours a dark mahogany ale, murky (due to yeast). Three finger head of light latte falls to sheet of the same. Good, coarse lacing. S: Malt, Brown sugar, raisins, dark fruits, figs, molasses. Dark, intriguing. Very nice and complex. Malts are excellent here.T: Above, then add graham and beautiful, bready yeast into the mix. Outstanding flavor. M: Full body and high carbonation. Wish the carb was a little high on this one. Too bad. O: Absolutely gorgeous beer. No question Rochefort is among the top five Trappist breweries."

"O: a very nice beer. I quite like this BSDA, and I am glad that I bought a quantity of it when I could. While Rochefort 10 is perhaps one of the best beers I have ever had, this beer is no slouch either. I think that I came with exceedingly high expectations for this beer, and I am not leaving disappointed."

"Very fruity. Fortunate to have some spice around to balance it out. Been a while since I've had this and the bottle has aged well. Should drink more often, especially for the value for money."
""

"O: In my personal opinion, it's awesome. By far the best beer I've ever had until this date. But I'm sure that the Trappistes Rochefort 10 that I have on the cellar will get me into heaven anytime soon."

"Give 'er a quick flick of the wrist and watch the head pop right up to give you a perfect drink every time. No doubt I'd have it again but first I have to find the 10 and 12."
""
""
"Overall Impression: a more drinkable version of the 10 with only slightly less flavor. Same flavors as the 10 though. Dark fruit, molasses, and fig notes pervade with solid hop bitterness rounding out the flavor to counteract the malt bitterness."
"Overall: A very good beer. I've based my rankings on three different bottles and I think my overall impression has gone down since I tried a bottle of the 10. Still fantastic and worth trying, especially if you're in Belgium where it can be found dirt cheap."
"O - This beer is good but not what i expected. The tart nose and taste kind of threw me. For the price this is not a beer I will seek out in the future."
"O-I admit that it took me a while to come around to the aggressive alcohol in this brew, but now that I'm hooked in, I really enjoy it. The dark fruit and burnt sugar flavors are spot on for a BSDA and complexity is fantastic. This is a great sipping beer that seems tailor-made to pair with some cheese and dried fruits."
"O: An amazingly crafted beer all around. The depth of flavor and aroma is mind-boggling when you really sip it and try to take notice. A casual beer drinker could miss the subtleties and just taste a strong rum-like Belgian beer, but this is truly a world class beer if ever there was one. One of the best Belgian beers out there."

"A-"
"I had this in occasion of the choice of the new Pope. A dark-brown beer, with a well-retained brown neck, forms a beautiful Belgian lace in the chalice. The aroma shows pears, apples, as well as many floral tones, together with a caramelized malt and, perhaps, plums. The taste brings a medium-body, extremely carbonated feel, with a caramelized malt backbone, and hops well present. There's a great harmony between the carbonation and the malty body, and the silkiness of the beer is impressive. Besides, the strong 9.2% ABV is not that perceptible. The aftertaste leaves both the delicious malt, a theme during the whole tasting, as well as hops. Despite being too strong for my personal taste, it was a great choice for the day!"

"Not as hoppy or strong (in terms of alcohol content) as its first cousin, Trappistes Rochefort 10. But this is still a very good product. It is very flavorful, and it serves as a great companion to a light lunch. It is a nice session beer, too. It's a perfect Saturday afternoon beer for those with good taste."

"It certainly is not Rochefort 10. None of the wow factor that I previously experienced with Rochefort beers. I think I have lost my taste for Belgians since I spent a week drinking nothing but last summer. Still enjoyable without a doubt, but just too one dimensional and thin. Not very ""dark"" for being classified as a strong dark ale. Will re-review at some point to give it another chance."
""
""
"O: Overall I was impressed by this beer. It had loads of flavors that I don't often get to experience, or haven't experienced at all. It is definitely a sipper, because it has such a presence that commands attention with every drink. I highly recommend it to Belgian beer lovers, or people who are not afraid of uniquely flavored beers. This one is definitely unique."

"[O] Prime example of aging gone bad. Either that or this bottle was mishandled. (The cellar conditions were nearly perfect under my watch.) The '10' had the same ginger ale notes. Will definitely be re-reviewing a fresher bottle."
""
"The first sip of course very effervescent with the carbonation, but still felt light in my mouth, not syrupy or thick. The smell and taste was that of a slight amount of dark fruits. Alcohol was present in the taste as the beer weight in at 9,2%. Overall an excellent selection"
"O- A high quality beer, but is this really one of the best beers in the world? I think I need to drink more beer to know for sure. Still, worth getting and trying out. I would get it again, and now I want to try the other beers from this brewery. Then again, maybe I poured it into the wrong glass, since this glass is a lot taller than it should be."

"Beer is medium-bodied, with carbonation of medium-low intensity, resulting in a fizzy mouthfeel that gradually settles to a calm, smooth, slightly foamy flow. Ethanol is easily, aggressively felt in the nostrils, on the tongue, and the back of the throat. Not impressed at all. Closes semi-dry, with substantial stickines lingering across the palate."

"This is my favorite Trappist ale and should be paired with the finer things in life, such as filet minion, smoked goose, aged white cheddar and black grapes, and thanksgiving dinner"

"APPEARANCE: Many ivory durable foam. It is a layer of thick middle finger permanently and brands of foam from the maximum height reached to serve. Dark brown and very watery black between. / AROMA: In the first instant of pouring it into the glass, the smell is rum. Almost immediately after the aroma is strange, as spoiled rum, if such a thing could occur. Maybe that smell comes from alcohol. Unpleasant. Prefer not go nosing. / Taste: Creamy. Intense roasted flavors. In the back of the palate and throat leaves a permanent taste a little aggressive. Taste very conflicted: have to like it a lot or you dislike. Definitely something burning, as if I had grabbed the stew at the bottom of the pot and also, for some mysterious reason, that stew had spoiled bitter. Salted. There is a beer that fit off the middle ground. / GENERAL ASSESSMENT: Not as good as they say. Pretty bad. 2.50 euros. / January 2013"

"O – This is a really nice beer. It’s a little on the lighter side of the Belgian strong darks in terms of appearance and fruit profile in both the aroma and taste, but it sure is tasty. I know it’s a different style but I liked the 6 a bit more. I think it was just a bit more complex and enjoyable. Let’s see how the 10 goes. I’m excited."

"Overall (5/5): Rochefort 8 is a genuine classic Belgian ale and perhaps the finest of the Trappist ales I have had the pleasure of consuming. Its reputation is certainly well deserved. A lovely, understated, and refined dark ale with the perfect mix of fruit and bready flavors, it is pleasant and easy to drink despite its considerable strength."
"Pours a translucent, dark cider-amber color with a big, foamy, long-lasting light tan head. Bubbles migrate from the bottom, perpetually feeding the immortal head. Mild spiciness on the nose. A little metal soup can, date and brown sugar aromas as well. Mouthfeel is such that the beer slides. Just enough of a carbonation burn gradually appears to balance the slickness of the beer. Mild tartness in the beginning. Brown sugar appears just before the finish. A lot of balance in the beers flavors and mouthfeel. A very good Belgian by comparison. No alcohol warmth at all."
""
""
""
""
""
"This pours a medium brown color with a foamy light brown head. The scent has elements of nuts, yeast, and malts. I’m definitely getting the Belgian Strong Ale scent from this one. The taste is bold and heavy. There are a lot of complex flavors including caramel malts, toasted malts, yeast, and burnt sugars. Great texture and volume adds great depth to make this another fantastic brew from Rochefort."
"Overall, a fine Monk-brewed beer, and one that fits well with its mates in the Rochefort range. It is very finely balanced and hides its ABV well."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, super smooth for the abv and very tasty."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a murky mahogany with a one finger fluffy bone white head. Exceptional retention, lacing that sticks to the side of the chalice and slowly slides down to rejoin the creamy head. Fruity nose; fig, date, hint of apricot, and perhaps some pear joined by phenol alcohol. Big malty body; spicy, dry, with yeasty pumpernickel bread crust. Brown sugar and pear, apricots, rich fig and date. Alcohol is ever-present but always perfectly balanced. The complexity of this brew is simply stunning and the balance is just as impressive. Medium-bodied, smooth with lively carbonation that pokes through here and there to tickle the palate. Truly world-class."

"Amazing. This was my first Trappist beer. Bready notes, peppery notes. Dark fruits. Super Complex. Pours a murky brown color. Nice head if poured correctly. I haven't had this beer in a while, but I don't know why it got logged as a one so I am updating! It is excellent!"
""
""
"Definitely my favorite of the Rochefort trio. The flavor profile really unlike anything I've tasted up to this point. So many flavors can be identified, however the beer never seems overwhelming or hodge-podge, it's very well balanced and put together nicely. Great brew."
""
""
""
"Despite the 9.2% of alcohol and the darkness of the beer, this is remarkably fresh and balanced, while still very complex. The best of it's kind I've had by far."
""
"Overall: this is a very tasty beer and deceptively easy to drink. The smell alone was fantastic. I didn't find it terribly complex but that didn't detract from the great flavors that are present."
""
""
"Flavors are dead on with the nose, minus nuttiness. Add spicy. Warm. However, I'm surprised at how light the body is, at least compared to what I expected. Carbonation is tight. Body is moderate and highly quaffable; outstandingly so for a 9.2% abv. I guess these Rochefort fellows earned their reputation."
""
""
"Not your typical Dubbel here. Lots of earthy mysterious flavors in this one. Drinks way better with the yeast sediment poured in. The thin component threw me off a bit."
""
""
"Pours more black than the 10, same cream colored head but it settles a bit thicker, around 1.5 fingers. Nose is dry spice, figs, more fruity than 10, some grapes, a hint of cherries and definitely some burnt sugar. The taste is somewhat sweeter. Fruity, cherry, grape, plum, apricot, malty, clove, slightly smokey, a hint of chocolate and maybe just a bit of pears in the far back. No alcohol heat on this one. There is pretty strong carbonation, the body is medium, it goes down smooth and gives a slight sting on the tongue. Definitely better than the 10 in my opinion but they are both excellent. Gooo Monks!"
""

""
""

"Overall: Go buy this beer if you have not tried it. If you have tried it I doubt you need to be told to buy it."

""
""
""
""
"O- Best of the style for me so far."
""
""
""
"O: nice brew all the way around. I really enjoy the variety of sweetening aspects of this brew and find them all well balanced with each other. As I previously stated, I wish this had a bit more viscosity but that’s just my preference. Still a very enjoyable brew and a perfect representation of the style."
"O - This beer is just a huge dose of awesome. Balance and drinkability are top notch. The lower ABV than the 10 makes this one a bit easier to throw back. One of few I never hesitate to grab at $5/11.2oz"
""
"Overall: This is a very aggressive, yet balanced, brew. It is a little expensive but definitely worth having from time to time. I would definitely label this beer world class."
"It's a murky brownish reddish color with a loud off white head that quickly dissipated. The smell has lots of raisin and sweet caramel along with some clove and more dark fruit. Tastes nice and sweet, I noticed clove and banana with hints of grape and candisugar. It's surprisingly light with active carbonation and a dry finish. This is an amazing beer but not a 100 in my opinion."
"Mahogany with a small but solid cap of offwhite head. Nose is potent, loads of nutty liqueur, dark fruits, plums, currants, brown sugar and some alcohol. Taste has some more nutty liqueur with some harsher than anticipated ethanol, oxidized in a light cardboard-y kind of way, and retains only mild dark fruit and brown sugar qualities. Watery feel, and ethanol (almost tequila-like alcohol) comes out again in the finish. Over the hill, and unfortunate. I'll need to try this much younger for reassessment."
"Yeast is aggressive to the point of absurdity. Phenolic and ultimately lacks the depth I like to see. So much alcohol."
"O: Very good dubbel, though not quite as good as Rochefort 10. Hits a lot of the right notes."
""
"O: An outstanding dubbel. (It'd better be for that price.) A great celebration ale. Even smoother as it warms."
""
""
"O: Smooth and complex, and very drinkable."

""
""
"O: Sweet nectar of the Gods. I would rather die than to live without this beer in my life. It’s an absolute must-try for every self-respecting human being. Easily one of the best beers around. This is a very stripped-down review. The tastes in this beer is so complex, I can't even begin to imagin how to describe them all. If, like me, you aren't a huge fan of the Rochefort 10, do give the 8 a try. I'm sure this one will work for you."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"WOW. I have a new love , just dont tell my wife. I wish there were words that I knew in my hillbilly language to describe the taste and smell of this beer. The smell , the taste , the alcohol in this one is really sneaky , never guess that it had such a high content , no wine bottle smell in this. I can pick these up at 5 bucks a bottle , being in a small dry county in Arkansas this is a bargain with a 30 minute drive , but I pick my kid up at the state line anyway , I would love to have one of these with a nice filet grilled medium rare"
""
""
""
""
"This really starts to come together as the beer opens up and the carbonation has the chance to fritter away. It tasted better with each sip."
""
""
""
"In short - disappointed. I really wanted to give this a great review, as Rochefort 10 is one of the greatest I've ever had, but it seems messy overall in terms of conflicting flavors and thinned body. Again, this may be a bad batch, but I have had this at least once before and it didn't blow me away. It perhaps seems to be too middle-of-the-road in between 6 and 10. But no matter what, it is still a good quality product that should be tasted, as it is very popular and well loved in the global beer community. I just find that there are far better (and cheaper) DBPAs or ""imperial dubbels"" that can be found out there."

"O: Delicious for the style. A fine crafted brew that deliciously hides the ABV and very drinkable. Very complex in taste, smell, and feel. Highly recommended"
""
"Pours a fairly clear dark copper color with a decent off white head that shows some retention. Smells of caramel, figs, raisins, a bit of earthy yeast with hints of brown sugar. The flavor follows the aroma quite well. A solid hit of caramel, dark sugar, and dark dried fruits. Medium body with an overzealous level of carbonation and sweet bubbly mouthfeel. I like this beer a lot, but dark Belgians like this always seem over carbonated for my palette."

"Overall, awesome. Definitely world class, dubbels are good but this was exceptional."
""
""

""

"Pours a very dark brown, with a beige head - medium bubbles, quickly dissapates, just a little bit of lacing. Scents of molasses, fig, a bit of musk, and spice. Taste is not at all what I expected, very unique indeed. Not quite sure what to make of it, it has this sort of funky creaminess with notes of spice (coriander?) dark fruit, soy, and some roasted malt. Mouthfeel is lighter than what I would have expected too, its somewhat light, compared to others in this style, very slightly syrupy. One rather pleasing is the aftertaste it leaves. Overall a very unique brew, not as pleasant as I'd hoped but certainly glad I tried it."
""
"O: Yuck. Like drinking whiskey soaked splinters. Not my cup of tea but an excellent beer non the less."
""
"O: a classy beer, defines the style"
""
""
"Review from 7/2010 notes. Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Pours a dark, dark red amber with massive head and lacing. Dark fruit aroma. Absolutely delicious. Tastes of dark fruit, caramel slightly floral with Belgian yeast and malt. Complex, rich and flavorful. Approaching perfection."
""
"Bought a bottle of this from the Tobu department store in Ikebukuro, Japan. Poured into a Rochefort goblet. Beautiful, mystical dark brew with the abysmal bubbles common to high-quality Belgian strongs bubbling up from the bottom. However, I didn't see the same alcohol rim as I saw on the 10 in this one. The smell is so intoxicating and invigorating as you pour this out, especially into the wide-brimmed goblet. The taste was superb with dark berries and cherry, and the 9.2% comes through beautifully in a warming way. I can only lower this ranking because I have the 10 to compare it to. This is an outstanding beer, and I recommend it for anyone with an advanced enough palate to really enjoy it."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a murky brown color with a bubbly beige head that never goes away - unbelievable retention! Not much for lacing though. Aromas are musty, earthy, fresh woodsy air, ripe fruit. Tastes are fruity, earthy, brown sugar, candi sugar, spicy, orange zest, faint banana, booze. Mouth is creamy and smooth, finishes spicy, warm, and boozy. Overall, great example of the style with nice complexity. I should have picked up another and let it age for awhile just to see how it comes out a year or 2 later. Either way, it's a solid Abbey Dubbel."
""
"O - A really great dubble. The tend to vary from bottle to bottle in my area. I like them with more dark fruit and less alcohol, but you never know what you are going to get. Always a great import and fantastic on a cold day or for dessert."
""
"Overall is this supposed to be this carbonated? I might hit up the brewery and see if I got a bad batch because it kind of ruined my drinking experience."
"I had a bottle of this a few years ago, but I don't remember it being so interesting. It's a bit too phenolic for my taste, and it lacks some complexity in the malts, but it is charming nonetheless."
""
"This is complex. There's so much to get out of this beer that I think I'd be pointing out different flavors and aromas after dozens of tastings. The mouthfeel is such that this doesn't feel as much of a sipper as other beers with this kind of complexity. I usually think I couldn't have a Rochefort 10 or St. Bernardus Abt 12 more than once every three months or so. But this is very drinkable and approachable, despite the many facets it presents. What more is to say about this oft reviewed beer? It's good, and I'd try it again when I have the time to savor it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall I'm not the hugest Belgian fan, but this one is amazingly well executed and definitely sets the standard as far as I'm concerned within the style."

"Drink- A great beer with tons of flavor and a great prickly whiskey flavor. Dont ask me why. Loved it!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Almost as good as a classic trappist beer can be. Huge, decadent and if you're not careful... will put you on your ass. It's funny how this beer still manages to be delicate even with all the huge flavors."
""
""
""
""
""
"Now the taste rivals and compares to Westvleteren 8. Light body, but very sweet. Mostly those cherries and just a bit more dark fruits. Slight hint of all that booze come late, but in a great way. Yeast and bubbles make it feel effervescent, and make the flavors pop on the tongue."
""
"O: This is a very nice, fruity and sweet beer, heavy feeling in the mouth, intense flavours hide the alcohol, probably my favourite of the 6, 8 and 10 of the Trappistes Rochefort beers due to its good drinkability. I like it as a beer after a good meal, or paired with a dessert."
""
""
""
"An incredible-smelling beer. One of those beers that amazes you in what beer can be. The 8 is exceptionally good, but I look forward to re-visiting the 10."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - 3.5 - After Westmalle, this is the second of the big name Belgian dubbels to disappoint. I loved Rochefort 6 and am looking forward to Rochefort 10 so I was hoping for a clean sweep, but it was not to be. Like Westmalle, it's got some good flavors, but also like Westmalle, it feels like it had its butt removed. There's no substance to anchor it. The flavors fleet along the topside and don't sink in. It's thin and fizzy. The flavors are there but faint. I'd like to boil this down until it was more concentrated and then try it again. It's like a sauce that's too thin. My face is pleasantly warm afterwards, which is nice, but I would not buy this again."
""
""
"I know the reputation this beer has. I wouldn't say that this would be a favourite. Was thrown by the thin body, or maybe the carbonation. Almost over carbonated. Just my opinion but I think that this one is a bit overrated. Good, not great. Not a touch on Chimay Red"
"Taste isGREAT"
"Overall: Was perhaps a bit congested while sipping this, so didn't get overall amazing experience. Still, when I swished it around in my mouth a bit I was able to get some of the deeper, more complex flavours, and that made the drinking experience great, instead of good."
""
""
""
"O: This is an incredible beer. Has a little bit of something for everyone in it, and the 9.2 abv is hidden well. A must try brew."
""
"overall: strong"

"O: I’m really impressed with this. Dubbels haven’t traditionally been my favorite style but this is a masterpiece in brewing. Crazy complex and undeniably satisfying. I will be revisiting this one many times."

"I suppose I've enjoyed this beer 10+ times but somehow I never managed to review it. So I picked up a bottle on a lazy Wednesday afternoon and gave it a go. Pours a clear mahogany with tight bubbled head of ecru foam. Dark, caramelized sugar is the backbone - cherry, toffee, raisin, and demerera sugar. Super dry and quenching with a really mild bitterness. 9% ABV?! If it wasn't $5 for 11.2oz I could really get in trouble, but it's not nearly as complex as the 10."

"O-- Well hidden alcohol. Easy to drink for 9%. Good beer even with some syrupy qualities to it."
""
"Very nice. Pours dark brown/gray with creamy head. Bit of sediment. Notes of fig and slight cocoa on the aroma. Taste is mild dark fruit, some light chocolate sweetness. Figs, raisins, pears. Thinner mouthfeel than the 10, but still pretty full bodied for the style with medium carbonation. Good stuff. Like, really good stuff."
""
"First off this beer is super carbonated. At over 9% abc i didn't think i would have to be so gentile pouring this beer. It produces a nice off white fluffy head that recedes rather quickly as expected with such high abc. The beer is a touch hazy, probably front he bottle conditioning. It has a reddish brown body, touches of maroon hues coming through as well. The aroma is very pronounced rum soaked raisins. it even has a touch of vanilla and maybe some creaminess on the nose. Dark fruit characteristics followed by molasses come through as well. There is a big boozy character on this one, and i don't really deduct points here because it compliments the beer and makes it much lighter than what 9.2% usually is. The flavors are also pronounced raisins, rum, and molasses. I get a woody character from the finish and it leaves the palate extremely dry. There is a huge level of carbonation on this beer as bubbles coat your mouth, leaving a stinging feeling from the alcohol as well. Drinks a little lighter than a beer of this high abc but nothing mind-blowing in terms of hiding the burn. Definitely a sipper. Overall this is a great beer to have and one of the stronger dubbels i have had. Really good treat and easy to get a hold of. Recommended."

"Just had this with dinner and it was Amazing. Thick, lustrous head with a dark red-walnut coloring. The smell is complex, ranging from yeasty bread to dried fruit. The taste is supple and deep, assaulting you with crusty bread, dates and raisins, apples, chocolate, caramel, bananas, and everything else you'd expect in a great dubbel. The mouthfeel was almost perfect, and still fantastic. This is a great one, and not too expensive either. Get it."
"Overall: This is unbelieveable stuff. Not what i usually go for but it's worth the experience. Thoroughly pleased to pick this one out tonight"
"O- Great Dubbel, maybe the best ive ever had, truly a treat from start to finish."
""
""
"Overall, I find myself impressed with the overall experience despite the beer being so boldly carbonated. The flavours are equally bold, you see. Nothing holds back, and I'm glad I had two."
"I definitely taste and smell the difference between this and Rochefort 6. The nose is more assertive and there is added depth to the flavor which allows it to support the high level of carbonation a bit better than the 6. This beer is definitely worth the price difference."
""
""
"Great stuff! Complex and delicious!"

"330 ml bottle into chalice, best by 5/11/2016. Pours super murky dark reddish brown color with a nice 1 finger dense khaki head that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Spotty lacing on the glass, with a good amount of carbonation streaming up. Aromas of huge raisin, plum, grape, banana, molasses, pepper, clove, biscuit, toasted grains, and huge yeast spices. Incredible aromas with a ton of complexity. Taste of big caramel, molasses, plum, raisin, biscuit, banana, clove, pepper, and yeast spices. Lingering notes of dark fruit, molasses, banana, pepper, and yeast spice on the finish for a good bit. Great flavor balance and complexity. Medium-high carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a fairly creamy and slightly slick mouthfeel with a bit of prickly carbonation. Quite smooth to drink at 9.2%, but is still a sipper. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming after the finish noticed. Overall this is a fantastic Dubbel. Big complexity and balance; and extremely enjoyable."
""
"O: This style (and most trappists) seem to be a bit sweet for my palate, but their complexity of flavors is absurd. So many notes, none overwhelming."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This one was much more spiced and complex than I remember; still, it’s balanced in its complexity. Rochefort 8 is a different kind of dubbel, though it proves with each sip that this style is all about consistent power in the palate."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Bottle dated 090216. Poured into a chalice. Pours dark brown with some sediment and a frothy off-white head that dissipates quickly. The head dissipates, leaving a small amount of lacing around the edge. Smells of brown sugar, fig, banana, plum, and roasted malts hit the nose. There are flavors of brown sugar, fruit, yeast, hops, and some alcohol, but it's faintly detectable. The mouthfeel is creamy and full and the finish is dry. The carbonation is abundant, but it serves to help enhance the flavors and drinkability of this beer. Overall, this is an excellent beer that I highly recommend."
""
"Solid yet delicate, complex yet easy to access, great quaffable quality yet hiding an evil trait, this beer is totally remarkable."
""
"The beer is a little bit dry in the mouth, but drinks easily."
""
""
"This is an ideal beer to sit back and relax with. I enjoyed it while watching the NY Giants."
""
""
""
""
"O: A fantastic creation - but it isn't the life changing revelation I expected it to be. This is the classic example of expecting raw perfection and only getting brilliance instead. Still, highly recommended for everyone to try at least once."
""
""
"For now the Rochefort 10 and Chimay blue as a lighter, a bit spicier and less sweet alternative to the Rochefort 10 are my favorite (Belgian) beers."
""
""
"O: Excellent beer. Very smooth and well balanced and just enough alcohol to balance it out."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, very nice. complex and well balanced. No single flavor is over the top leaving a nice balance to keep you sipping and searching for more."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- out of 6, 8, 10, I think that this one is my favorite one. good flavor and a little smoother than the rest. Very tasty"
"O: OVerall, this is a good beer. I enjoy it. Not my favorite style but I would recommend it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"33 cl bottle coded 141216. Aroma of caramel malts, raisins and dark pitted fruit. Taste is highlighted by molasses, raisins, candi sugar, brown sugar, slight cola. And of course that lovely rochefort trademark yeast esters. Delicious, beautiful, no abv noted on taste. A classic."

"The flavors and feel end up winning out for this. Real classy and smooth with balance being what it's all about. The alcohol isn't noticeable in the slightest either"
"O: I prefer this to the Rochefort 6 and the Rochefort 10. Great balance in the flavors. Wonderful to enjoy but one was the perfect serving."
"Good example of style - almost great."
""
""
""
"O- I've had this fresh and I've had it aged which is what this one is, nearly 4.5 years. This is my least favorite out of the 6,8, and 10, but it doesn't make it a bad beer by any means. I prefer the maltiness of the 6 or the complexity of the 10, this one just seems lost between the two to me."
""
""
"O: Not a stunner like the 10. Definitely worth a try, but didn't blow my mind."
"My least favourite of the Rochefort beers, much prefer the 6 to all the least my sense and I am sure the minority in this regard. Lot 28 12 10 and has been in my cellar for a long time. Boozy chocolately and a nice example of a dubbel maybe have to revisit a much younger bottle some time but sure going to drink the other half case that is in the cellar."

"Overall i was impressed. Complex and delicious. If you can get ahold of one of these, please do. I know i will."

"Overall, this is my first trappist beer and very promising for the genre. It is basically my first dubbel. I'm looking forward to trying more of the Belgian styles."
""
"Overall: An amazing beer that lives up to its reputation."
"Overall an amazing experience, now I feel like I've been missing out but at the same time I can really appreciate something like this. Big and bold, but in the well-rounded Belgian tradition. A great sipper that makes you feel like a king as you drink it from a goblet."
""
""
"O: This beer didn't do it for me...I'm sure its a shining example of the style but to me the flavor profile isn't enjoyable...malty sweetness, darker fruitiness, chalky yeast."
""
""
"Poured to my Duvel tulip glass. Pours a murky brown with a 1 finger foamy white head. Some retention and lacing throughout. The aroma is rather mild but pleasant: dried fruits, figs, malty sweetness, and light yeast character. The flavor follows suit with an immediate rush of fruit flavor that melts to the malty sweetness. Yeast provides a delicate character and works well with the sweetness.The beer finishes very smooth. Medium bodied. Overall, this was a good beer and I would easily drink again."
""
""
""
"O: By far the best dubbel ive tried to date. Like the rochefort 6, this was almost a religious experience. Im very excited for the 10."
""
""
"Overall I really enjoyed this one and actually enjoyed it much more than the Rochefort 10 I had earlier today."

"Poured from a 33 cl bottle into a goblet. This pours a dark tea color, hazy, with a small tab head which quickly dissipates. The smells are of dark fruit, chocolate, sweet malts, alcohol. The feel is medium with high carbonation. The taste is good dark fruit, the unexpected chocolate flavor (not dark), sweet malts, and a little alcohol burn, excellent."
""
"This has all the characteristics of a Dubbel and even though this isn't what I usually drink, a beer like this is so easy to appreciate. The strength of this makes it tricky to enjoy quickly but I have a feeling that most people have this for the wonderful flavors, full body, and beautiful appearance. There's no doubt there's a lot to like about this!"
""
"Overall. Just a fantastic beer."
""
""
"O: Very nice indeed. A big step up from the 6. Great drinkability and the abv is hidden very well. Goes down fast and easy."
""
""
""
"This is definitely one of the best brews I have tried thus far, and am anxiously awaiting a good time to break open a bottle of Rochefort 10! If you want a world class ale, turn to the Trappists!!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
" dinner as a dessert."
""
"O: A terrific Belgian ale. Would love to have this with some food next time."
""
""
"B+ "
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this was a slight disappointment after having Rochefort 10, which was the best Quad I've had. Not a poor beer, by any means, but the carbonation and high level of sugar was a bit off."
"O- Very good, I found the Rochefort 10 to be a little hot, this one was spot on."
"D - Exceptionally built, subtly complex. A great beer, but not quite as good as I was expecting."
"O: just a perfect representation of the style, hits everything spot on, i still think that it is just slightly below omeegang abbey ale but we shall see how the numbers pan out"
""
""
""
"pours out a dark grape juice color with a very thin head that fizzes out quick. nose is made up of apples, pears, banannas, grapes, figs and malts. taste is very well blended and balanced between big breay malts and dark fruits, almost like a table wine, a very good one. mouthfeel is medium heavy with a long burn on the finish, could also use a little more carbonation, feels flat on the tongue. very enjoyable beer."
"O: Just a bit off on the tongue here, otherwise a stellar beer. Happy New Year!"
"O-This is an excellent Belgian ale that I have no complaints about. Everything is crafted perfectly. It is a wonderful beer that I would drink many times over."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A very nicely balanced beer. I could see myself enjoying this again for maybe a special occasion. Without a doubt, the best dubbel I've drank to date. The rich maltiness and balance absolutely blow other dubbels out of the water."
""
""
"O - one of my favorite brews of any kind. Anywhere. Very tasty with an enjoyable smoothness. This may be the best dubbel in the universe. It's a brew thats hard not to buy when you see it on the shelves. If you want a true world class Belgian ale, try the Rochefort 8."
"o - Fantastic!"
""
""
"I think this is probably my most favorite style of Belgium Ales that I have tryed thus far and this is 	a fine example of this style."
""
""
""
""
"O: This is decent, easy to drink, but it's too expensive for me to consider it worthy at $4 for a 11.2 ounce. I wouldn't buy this again."
"Pours a very dark mahogany into a goblet. Light tan head and little lacing on glass. Smells fantastic! Very rich and malty smell with lots of bread notes, and ripe fruit. I can smell dark chocolate and caramel. It smells like a rich meal. Taste follows the smell closely for me. Sweet and yeasty. There is a slight bitterness. Carbonation is light. Everything blends perfectly. I may be a little biased toward these monks. Overall I think this beer is almost perfect."
""
""
""
""
"Overall this brew is on of the best of the style I have ever had. A good friend has told me about brew a few times, and I am glad I had a chance to finally have it. I will make sure to try the many other brews from this brewery. Great Brew!!!"
""
"Overall: The best Dubbel I have had to date, absolutely delicious. This is a beer that has been recommended time and time again and I see why. It lives in the shadow of its heavier brother but it shouldn't, this is well above average even by Trappist ale standards. Now to finish of the glass with some cheese. CHEERS!"
""
"O - This is a beautiful Belgian trappist beer. I wouldn't go as far as to call it a Dubbel, but it's not your typical Strong Dark Ale either. Excellent winter warmer and a very good sipper that I will certainly have again."
""
""
""
""
"O. This one is going to be added to my list of favourite beers, no question. A delicious dubbel without the sweetness that can mar some beers of the style for me. Superb."
""
"Overall a very smooth beer & a tasty one at that. Try this beer if you can it wont dissapoint you."
""
""
"Notes: My 2nd Trappiste. Decent but ultimately disappointing."
"O: Nice and sweet, as I expect my dubbels to be. Though it's a little too hot, what I really like about this beer is the fact that it doesn't taste like a regular beer, but something that's been crafted to be different and arguably better than the rest. That's probably the number one reason I always come back to Trappist beers. Well worth trying at least once."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"T: the body is lighter than expected i would say medium light, the flavour is so deep, especially the throat warming wiht the alcohol, well balanced"
"Overall a high quality beverage."
""
""
""
"Overall: quite delicious!"
""
""
""
""
""
"After only having a few Dubbels prior to the Rochefort 8, I was rather pessimistic about Dubbels as a whole. However, this beer changes my outlook on Dubbels and would be something I would highly recommend to beer lovers of all styles."
""
"The mouth is quite bubbly and effervescent, almost too much so. I'd rather this be a little less spritzy, but that's just me. The fruit-like qualities carry over to the flavor as well. Apple, plum flavors noted. Candy-like sweetness on the finish. Yeast quality is mellow and not overbearing at all, which is how I like it. Adds just a touch of spice on the back end. All in all, this is a good beer. A pleasant sipper and treat to be shared."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I was hoping for more, but admit to only having a few Dubbels prior to this, so I can't compare to many others of the variety."
""
""
""
""
""
"a belgian staple! pours brown like molasses with that classic fluffy belgian head. smells like dried fruits, caramel malts, and candy sugar. sweet and complex, the taste is spot on. evolving from malty to fruity to slightly spicy. full bodied (as the belgian beers go), and lively carbonation. goes good with almost any cuisine, and if you can afford it, would be infinitely enjoyable. a nice treat from time to time, but their 10 is even better!"
""
""
""
""
"Overall, it's a hell of a good beer. It's beautiful, smells great and has a wonderful complex taste and feel to it, albeit a touch sweet. Never mind, it's very close to perfect for the style."
""
"First Dubbel I've had and wasn't quite sure what to expect. Sweet and moderate carbonation are the first adjectives that come to mind. Maybe not my favorite style but Damn good! Very drinkable despite the ABV. Slight Booziness is masked well by the sugars. Ripened fruit...bananas maybe. Smell is slight citrus but mainly plums, figs, brown sugar. Wish I bought more than one! No real hoppiness detected."
""
""
""
"O. A very fine crafted brew. It's somewhat potent so moderation is the key here."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Complements loud thrashy avant-garde jazz such as Cecil Taylor or Sun Ra."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall – An enjoyable beer that is very drinkable but I think I was expecting a little more complexity. I enjoyed the Rochefort 10 much more. Still worth seeking out."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Good flavor and appearance. Soda pop like mouthfeel is the main drawback. Overall, good but still not the hype that so many make this to be."
"O: Excellent! I prefer the 10, but this is a fine example of the Trappistes style! It's going on my list of favorites and a to buy anytime i see it."
""
""
""
"Overall: Really solid trappist beer. I prefer the Rochefort 10 over this beer. Just a little bit thinner than I like my beers, but it appropriate for this beer style."
""
""
""
"A little smoke off the pour, nice head with brown tinge. Fruity pine and plum smell that is very distintive.. it reminds me of pinoclean in a strangely pleasant way. Flavours of coffee and burnt toffee, strong boozey flavour of the alcohol. A little harsh on the palate, tangier than other trappist ales I've tried, but I love the complexity and the maltyness that comes through as it warms up."
""
""
""
""
""
"Improves upon all the shortcomings of the 6. A fantastic brew."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"In a tulip: Dark, murky brown pour that blew up in the glass with a huge head, may be due to the aggressive pour. No lacing. Dissipated to an interesting ring of foam on the circumference with a big dot in the middle. Smells heavenly of spicy bread and dates. Alcohol presents itself right away and then yields to the sugars and earthy twigs. Malt. Banana and dried fruit sit on the tongue and frolic in the bubbles of the ultra dense carbonation that this brew displays. Tantalizingly smooth feel with a chewy sour bite on the jaw. Really well made. This is a bargain at $5. Can't wait till my next one."

"Serving: Bottle poured in Rochefort Chalace."
"Fascinating and confusing."
"Overall this is just a great beer; add it to my list of beers to keep stocked at all times."
"Overall-A perfect Belgian, sweeter than the 10. Excellent beer again."
"Medium slightly carbonated body, and easy to sit back a sip for while. Because overall this ale is full of flavor."
"Overall: Very good! I'm really glad we can get these again in Texas, time to add to my cellar."
"This is one heck of a beer... but it's just not to my taste. I'll rate it down a bit, but don't let that stop you from trying it."
"D: cannot believe this is 9.2 and as fresh as it is. literally no heat and drinks like a wit (sans body). very impressive showing from Rochefort and i look forward to trying 6 and 10."
"After drinking 6, I was worried, but this beer is just fantastic. Dark fruit character with some citrus notes, and nice alcohol/rum character. Nice phenolics that blend well...a bit of age could make this divine."
"A great beer made by master brewers!"
"O: Really nice beer. I can see why its the top in its style, just classic. Easy drinking with a great flavor profile."
"Overall: Very smooth and leaves you wanting more. Went down pretty fast for being a rather high ABV. The alcohol is not overpowering but the beer should still be a sipper. A dessert beer."
"O: better than the Rochefort 6. About this one can also be said: books can be written about it, but does it invite to buy another one? No, thank you."
"I'm surprisingly a bit under-whelmed here. The 10 was one of the best beers I've ever had but this one doesn't really live up quality-wise. Still, a pretty solid Belgian but I don't think I'll be picking it up again as long as the 10 is available."
"Overall I'm enjoying this beer, although not nearly as much as the 10. Mouthfeel, aroma, and flavors of the 8 are muted to me in comparison. I wouldn't turn this down again, but for an extra $1 or so a bottle I would definitely pick up the 10 instead."
"While not as good as the 10,the 8 is still one of the best Belgian beers out there. It is quite tasty and complex which makes it a joy to drink."
"Overall: Sadly a little disappointing when compared to the 6 and 10. Maybe this wasn't the best bottle around - I will have to get another."
"Well, this is now a fair review. A very solid beer that I truly enjoyed and would drink anytime. Classic."
"O: Again, not my steez. Lots to think about, all well balanced and presented, but not enough of anything I really want to get. I found it to be very ""dark"" tasting (and I don't mean dark in the beer sense. Dark like listening to The Damed) and the spice profile didn't do it for me."
"This is artistry in a bottle. Delicious dark fruit. Equaly savory to the Westvleteren. I'm wowed"
"O: Overall, a good beer that is much smoother even fresh than most examples of the style. It's quite tasty and smooth, though slightly pricey. Still, it's worth it as an occasional treat."
" My mouth felt great afterwards, the carbonation was brilliant with no bad after-taste what so ever. Those monk's sure can brew beer, probably better than most."
"The Rest: A top notch Belgian SDA. Perfect for sipping nice and slow."
"Overall, it is a great beer that is very well-regarded with good reason. It is a complex beer, with a lot to experience with each sip."
"Overall a great representation of the Belgian Strong Dark Ale style. Very rich, powerful and complex beer, to be taken slowly and preferably not so cold."
"D- This is a sipping beer for sure. Little much on the carbonation but it has a good taste."
"Poured a massive almost all head of beige color. The body has a hazy burnt sienna brown appearance. Smell is very mild in my sample, with just a little dried fruit reminding me of fig and some caramel. Taste is more of the same flavors, mild, and with a buttery texture. There's a subtle long tingly finish. A fine beer, although personally I didn't experience anything dramatically different in #8 than I did in #6."
"O: A great beer except the alcohol could have been hidden a bit better. Not near as complex as the 10, but still a well crafted beer."
"Overall I was not very impressed with the smell but the taste complexity more than makes up for it. Very smooth for such a high abv."
"Overall: This is interesting and different, but the carbonation and rum flavor really drop this for me. Kind of disappointed."
"O: The aroma takes a back seat to the 6 IMO however the taste is superior."
"a very classy smooth heavy trappist ale ...."
"D: This is a sipping beer at it's best. Defiantly just something to have one of and savor it."
"O - I love this beer. Very good and fun to do with the 6 and 10"
"One of the nicest beers I've had to date. Unfortunately not available where I'm from."
"O: You would never know that this beer has such a high ABV. It is delicious. I highly recommend it."
"(O) This one kind of left me puzzled. I may have to try it again at some point and re-review. It's a pretty sweet brew and definitely doesn't drink like an almost 10% brew."
"Extraordinary,goes well with some nice beef stake with plum souse and roasted figs!"
"O: Very drinkable and tasty Belgian Strong Dark Ale that has a good balance of sweet and bitter."
"M - As I said earlier. For all the big, malty body that this beer has, it finishes with a clean, somewhat dry mouthfeel--almost making me want to drink it faster than I should. I'm in awe of how such a malt-heavy beer can be so drinkable and, well, not syrupy."
"O-This is awesome for a beer this big. I was prejudiced because of the hype. But, my only regret is there only remain a couple more sips in my glass and no more bottles in the fridge. Rated slightly lower due to cost. Almost as good as ""10"" and much better than ""6."""
"The mouthfeel is medium-bodied with high carbonation. Finishes slightly dry, but also a little sticky, an interesting effect. Overall, this is a great brew with nice complexities, a good combination of flavors and something enjoyable to consume."
"Sampled at Julio's Belgian Festival on August 14, 2011. It pours a bit murky but overall a darker amber and busy carbonation arising to a soft, frothy head. Sweet candied malts are first up in the aroma with a milder hop note. The bidy seemed to be medium to bold. The taste also had a significant sweetness but it was both enticing and interesting at the same time. The finish was clean. This is a beer that deserves the high ratings that it has received."
"O – A very, very interesting Belgian ale. Like nothing I have ever had before. This is my first introduction into the Trappistes. Originally was going to rate a 3.5, but then I wanted another one so I'll give it a 4.0."
"The beer is hazelnut brown, with a towering, frothy, tan cap. Plenty of lacing stuck on the chalice. The aroma brings forth yeast, malt, toffee, caramels. The beer has a yeasty sweetness to it, like fresh bread from a bakery, or perhaps a pastry. Delicious. We all found Rochefort 8 to be remarkably similar to Abbaye de Rocs Brune, which is interesting. Smooth, creamy feel, with minimal alcohol presence. While I do prefer the Rochefort 10, this beer is a gem. Recommended."
"D- 2nd Rochefort beer i have had and 2nd time im completely underwhelmed. I realise this is an older bottle but at 9.2% abv i would expect it to hold up and have some complexity retained. To me this is over carbonated, bland with a noticeable alcohol kick on the tongue. Ill need to hunt down a fresh bottle, looking at other reviews of these beers, im not drinking the same ones."
"I wouldn't normally, but with a beer with this pedigree I plan to re-review. I really think there is bottle variation with Rochefort because I just had a Westy and there is literally no comparison. For reference the bottle info is: 141014/7:43."
"This is a fantastic brew, and well-worth the cost and effort of locating a bottle. If I had a complaint, it would be that the carbonation does seem slightly high--I felt like I was drinking soda water at times--but the flavors more than make up for such a small trouble."
"O: Another amazing Belgian beer. Trappists can do no wrong in my book - never had a Trappist beer that I did not enjoy. Splitting this one with a good friend was even more enjoyable."
"My favorite Rochefort. This beer is so incredibly light yet drinkable, yet substantial and flavorful at the same time. I could see myself enjoying this in 100 degree heat or in the middle of a snow storm."
"Overall an incredibly complex and delicious brew with a rich malty sweetness to hold in all that unfiltered, yeasty flavor."
"Not a huge fan of this one as there are better options for this style out there. It's a bit too sweet although the high alcohol content is hidden well."
"O-When it comes to Belgian beers, I generally prefer the taste of Flemish beers but this one has since become a ""regular"" in my monthly beer lineup. I buy this weekly at my fave liquor store. I hope you like it as much as I do. Be daring, try it in a tulip glass and see if you get the same results."
"Looking forward to trying the Rochefort 10..."
"O-doesn't quite hit the spot like i was hoping. i went in to this beer really wanting a good dark belgian, but now i don't think i'll be wanting another one for quite some time. its definitely a complex beer, but its just way too harsh and unbalanced. its not something i'd recommend or get again."
"One of the best beers I've ever had. I haven't had too many beers in my life (say 30 or so), but this ranks in the top 5 easily. Expensive but worth it!"
"O: My favorite of the 3 Rocheforts. The Westvletern 12 is better.. but this is really close. And the fact that its light years easier to find gives it major bonus points. Excellent beer!"
"This is one of my favorite beers. At times I like it better than Rochefort 10. A Great example of what a great beer should be."
"Overall, I can see how this would appeal to certain people, but in the end, for me, it’s just not my thing... at all. Perhaps my palate isn’t quite sophisticated enough to truly enjoy this beer."
"This a tie with the ""10"" and a very good beer. Pours a pretty dark reddish-brown with a very thick and foamy beige head. Aroma of chocolate, cherry, malt and cloves. Smooth-drinking, with flavors of banana, malt, sherry and chocolate all vying for attention. Great finish, if a little carbonated toward the end for my tastes. All in all another fine effort from Rochefort."
"O: Excellent world class beer. I liked the other too Rocheforts and this one stand head to head with its peers."
"Complex flavors explode, mixing with mild dark chocolate, caramel, raisin and dry figs. The alcohol sneaks in at the end but is really subdued for a 9.2% beer. Overall, a very well-balanced and complex beer."
"Taste - Rich and nutty with hints of dark chocolate, muted stone fruit, more figs, and a subtly minerally bitterness."
"This is a medium to full bodied brew leaning more towards medium. It is modestly carbonated which is pleasant. The alcohol really hits home with a flavor and warmth typical for nearly double-digits in strength. Dare I say this brew could hold out for several more years? This is not only a wonderful example of the style (that goes without saying) but this is also an offering that when treated right can really withstand the test of time as well. Fantastic stuff."
"Truly an awesome beer, smells amazing, tastes amazing, and is a near perfect sipper."
"Poured into a chalice a deep mahogany with a nice eggshell head that retains well, leaving some streaks of lace on the glass. Typically, as with many trappist brews, this thing oozes craftsmanship and tradition. Lots of sugary, dried fruits in the aroma: apricots, figs, raisins, papaya; bready with a hint of spice. Allowing to warm a bit before drinking, revealing flavors of caramel malts, toasted banana bread, apricots and figs, Belgian yeast, with a slight alcohol bite. Medium-bodied, full of flavor, and a pleasure to imbibe."
"Overall an excellent beer, a good diplomat of the style. Now i'm anxious to finish this so I can go and finish the drink!"
"D: Absolutely spectacular dark Belgian ale that I will definitely drink again. Prices here in the states aren't even much more than what I paid in Belgium."
"What I wrote about Chimay I'll ""ditto"" with Trappistes Rochefort 8. Smooth, creamy and extremely tasty. By far an absolutely fantastic beer. My friends would ""second"" my opinions for they got to share in our beer drinking exploits when we brought back many a bottle of Rochefort 8. In the Brussels grocery stores this beer is plentiful in supply at a very reasonable price. Getting them home is a chore but well worth it."
"O: Overall I was disappointed with this beer. It’s certainly not terrible, but having recently tried the Rochefort 10, it is nowhere near the caliber beer that the 10 is, so it was a pretty big letdown. It was just too light and the flavors weren’t strong enough for my liking. I probably should have tried the 8 first, and then my opinion might be different."
"D: Very good belgian strong dark ale. I'd love to drink this all night long, especially considering the hidden alcohol, but that would be dangerous. A bit pricey but worth every penny."
"O - A very fine belgian ale. My wife and I both like it quite a lot and better than the 10. Worth seeking out."
"O - its a very good beer, i honestly am much more of a fan of belgian pales than darks but this is the best ive had to date of the style. wouldn't mind having a very old vintage of one of these."
"This beer poured out as a dark brown color, the head is big and tan colored. As it settles there is some light lacing on the glass left behind. The aroma is earthy with a mix of coffee. The taste resembles coffee as well along with some caramel sweetness. The mouthfeel was smooth and not really heavy like some dark beers. There was a lot of sediment in the bottom of the glass after the pour. Overall I though this beer was pretty good."
"Appearance is a hazy brown with a billowing tan head. There are nice snap-crackle-pop sounds while I wait for the gorgeous head to fall a bit so I can pour more. Surprisingly, almost no lacing is left on the glass. Scent is wonderfully complex - lots going on here, but I'm picking up toffee, raisin, maybe a little plum. A tasty malty sweetness (caramel, raisin, plum) comes through strongly, with a slight touch of bitterness in the finish to balance it out. It all fits together perfectly. A mild alcohol taste began to come out more as it warmed. Mouthfeel is rich, creamy, chewy, and absolutely sublime. Just an outstanding beer."
"Overall, this is superb. I glad I spent the money to buy this pricy little bottle, because this is outstanding."
"O: A decent ale, but not one I would seek out again. The combination of heavy funk and the opposing light and dark fruit flavors make this a one-and-done for me. I guess the best feature of this ale is the totally-hidden alcohol. I couldn't smell it, nor could I taste it. But strangely, I would almost welcome some alcohol flavor mixed in, because the existing flavors were not pleasing to me at all."
"Overall Drinkability - Good beer but i'm a little too ruined by tonights prank, and a little too paranoid to trust the beer i'm having. i'll get back to this another day."
"O: this is a good belgian beer, that i would definitely buy again."
"O- Another great beer from the Trappistes of Rochefort. Really complex, and tasty, I prefer the 10 to the 8 but they are both amazing beers that I will be drinking for years to come."
"O-Awesome beer. One of my favorites. So complex and smooth."
"Overall - This beer was very good. Almost perfect, but not quite there yet. I guess I am a little hard to please. A very well-brewed beer. I would have liked the taste that I experienced during the middle of my sip to have been a little stronger."
"O- Overall very pleased. I have a Belgian Dark Strong Ale fermenting now and if it is half the beer this is I'll be pleased!"
"O (D) - a great tasting and complex beer. Exquisite, not perfect. Something to keep trying for sure."
"O: Undoubtedly Rochefort 10's little brother - it's (obviously) a milder spitting image of Trappistes Rochefort's flagship 10. Richness and high ABV limits you to one or two, but that's really all you need. An exceptional Belgian Dark (heck, this could stand up to any Quad and do just fine), and certainly a benchmark for either style. A fantastic beer."
"This reminds me of why BSDA's are one of my favourite styles. Rich, full, and very flavourful. One bottle is a perfect serving. The alcohol presence in the taste was a bit too much for a 4.5 from me but I will be more than happy to revisit this down the road."
"O/D - Very tasty beer from Rochefort. Nothing they make has been close to average for me. Very drinkable and complex. Nothing to complain about at all."
"M-medium bodied with a high carbonation which was making for a very drinkable beer."
"O- One of my favorite beers."
"Pours a murky iced tea color with a 2 inch light tan head that fades to a thin cap. No lacing whatsoever. Smells of dark fruits, brown sugar, spices, and yeast. There is a hint of funky smell coming off this one, just like the 10 I just reviewed. Taste is of raisin puree, prune juice, spices, and slight Belgian yeast. Again, slight funk comes through in the taste. Mouthfeel is extremely flat and thick. This does not work well for this beer at all in my opinion. Overall, this seems to be another bad beer. I just gave the 10 a horrible review and this one is pretty bad too. I bought both bottles from the same store. Both were stored in a cooler at a high end bottle shop so I am not sure what happened on these. I will have to get another bottle of this one too so I can confirm infection issues."
"Did I mention it was hot?"
"The mouthfell lost points because it felt slightly chalky, but since that contributes to the dryness it actually works well. Its very smooth and drinks well. I'll be drinking more of these in the future."
"O: Not quite what I expected with the slight vinegar taste, but it didn't really detract from the flavor for me. Didn't overwhelm me as I thought it would, but I think I will seek it out again in the future for comparison and see if anything changes."
"An oft overlooked offering from Rochefort - overshadowed by their quad. Excellent on it's own, and perhaps even better as an ingredient in a proper rabbit dish."
"-- That's a Trappist! --"
"I wish I had a bigger bottle. Poured with a little yeast sediment which some was suspended in the frothy three finger head of light brown. Lace is sticky and clings from the top of the pour to the last of the glass. Color is a deep brown, a 35 on the SRM beer color chart. Smell is exquisite, with aromas of figs and dates, molasses, banana, spices, and malt. Taste is almost a good as the smell, with the sweetness of dates, molasses, honey, caramel, toffee, coffee, banana, and malt. Mouthfeel is full and creamy, with a punch from the carbonation, and a little mealy from the floating yeast. Plenty of punch from the alcohol hidden in the wonderful sweet flavor, a nice warming feeling from the first sip and flows over you like a large wave. Slightly pricey for every day drinking, but a great treat."
"To call it a classic is easy and almost unsporting, but it is exceptional in it's simplicity and elegance: so a classic it is!"
"Overali-Ya, this beer deserves the hype, it's very nice. I just love the complexity and the fact that it's easy to drink and goes down easy. Definitely going to seek out the 6 and the 10."
"Top notch beer here. It's not one that I am absolutely blown away by, but it is one that is just all around well done and it has been consistently made for so long. This one must be tried at least once."
"Dark brown color with amber notes and a huge fluffy tan head. very well carbonated, it's bubbly like a champagne which is visible despite it's dark color. smell of caramel, dark fruit and dark malts. taste is similar and very smooth. the taste is not overpowering and is almost like a ""light"" BSDA, but in a good way. Nice offering from Rochefort, perhaps my favorite of the three."
"O: Phenomenal. So interesting and enjoyable to drink. Nothing overwhelms."
"overall; one of the best examples of the style I've had, truly amoung the best."
"overall - good beverage overall"
"What unique flavors to this beer. Again very deep dark and complex. Reminds me of some Pomerol Bordeaux wines I've had. Black fruits, black cherry, black and red currants, anise, mushrooms, black truffle, prune, fig, burnt caramel, dank wet earth. So much going on christ. Carbonation is very lively but not in negative way. Man I'm amazed."
"this is indeed a world-class beer."
"hoppish bite that evens out the high amount of sugars. Awesome beer with a great varied complex taste, a good look and a great, light but voluptuous body. Trappist ales at their best, with drinkeability, strength and complexity."
"A lively mouthfeel--well carbonated, like a ginger ale. Dry and light/delicate almost yet packs a punch with the intense heat and flavors. Overall a very strong, interesting, complex ale."
"Ok, so I realized I had not reviewed a Trappist Ale in a long time so I'll man up and say it. I used beer advocate's ""top examples of style"" to help my search for a great start. There I said it. Great idea on my part because this beer was fantastic. It was a fluffy cream of booze and sweets. I highly recommend it."
"This brew has a light brown tint and fruity smell to it. The alcohol is most definitely there. Not like the Rochefort 10 though. I do believe this brew is easier to drink and has a larger appeal to the taste buds than the rochefort 10. EVERYTHING and I mean EVERYTHING about this beer lets us know there is a place in the world that makes perfection. This beer comes from there. Enjoy with friends and only friends who like to share."
"This beer enjoyed at the abner pub in Norman, ok in a chalice glass. The beer pours a nice orange brown color with a trace of off white head that doesn't stick around long. The aroma has notes of caramel and fig. The taste has very sweet notes of caramel, figs and grapes. The mouthfeel has nice balance of velvet and carbonation. Overall a very good Belgian."
"O- Great beer. Nose was not as complex as i would have liked but the taste and and everything else about the beer make it an excellent brew."
"O- Overall the appearance and nose made me doubt this brew for a second but the flavor came through in the end. A truly nice beer."
"Overall - this is an happy i tried, one id have again but not a session beer. what a great experience."
"O: This is definitely exceptional - the sweetness is a little overpowering but on the whole I'd say they did a fantastic job. It's both bold and complex, but not too challenging to just relax and enjoy. It reminds me a lot of Westvleteren's 8 - a more than adequate substitute until the next time I go to Belgium!"
" Grade A Purchased at Stoney's -- $5.99 each"
"Overall: I could drink this beer for the rest of my life and be happy if it wasn't so damn expensive."
"Taste is more floral and alcohol with subtle plum undertone. Warming. Much more complex than most of the American Belgians I have had lately. I prefered the Rochefort 10, but this beer is also a great treat. I am going to let it warm up a little and continue to savor."
"Great beer. As Belgian as it gets."
"D: Very well balanced beer, hardly any alcohol is noticeable, malty but sweet and spicy as well. This is a very good beer and a must try Trappist. Looking forward to trying 10."
"O: Very good beer. Definitely one to sip and enjoy. I noticed that the flavors started changing when the beer warmed a little. Would be nice on a cold night."
"Well, I loved the #10, so I thought I'd try this one too. Damn, it pours dark, dark, dark. A lot of carbonation. I get a whiff of bread, a little alcohol, and a slight amount of sweet fruit in the background. The taste is excellent, if a little carbonated. It tastes sweet, malty, with just a little alcohol going down. Am I getting a little toffee here as well? Whatever, it's really tasty, just like the 10. I wonder if trying the #6 next will be anticlimactic?"
"Medium bodied with high carbonation puts this beer smack dab between sipper and thirst-quencher. The carbonation seems a little high, as it causes the flavors to dissipate prematurely."
"-Flandes Bar, Oviedo, Asturias"
"While not as complex as its big sibling 10, it is a great beer for relaxing outside on beautiful Spring evening."
"This is a really complex beer, even for a complex style. I have another bottle that I plan to store for a while and see what happens with a little bit of age. Exceptional beer."
"Overall, it's a dandy beer that will put you on your ass if not sipped away like an English Gentleman."
"Overall - This a complex beer that gives the drinker a bit to think about. I recommend this beer to my red wine friends and they all enjoy it, especially my Syrah/Zin freaks."
"Overall this is quite enjoyable, I think I may like this more than the 10, but there's lots of good in this style out there. It will do no problem!"
"O- A solid beer that I am impressed by. Definitely in the realm of very good, though I don't know that it's necessarily the paragon of the style for me. That said, I'd gladly drink another."
"O: This one is better than the 6 but still not as good as the 10. Quite tasty, though."
"Overall this is a fantastic beer. The 12 gets all the love but the 8 is an easy, smooth drink where the ABV is only noticed when you get up out of your seat. Highly recomended."
"D: Although the alcohol is present, it is fairly pleasant and deceiving considering it is 9+ %(one would never know). Overall a great beer and I'd love another."
"Overall, this beer is a very nice BSDA. It's nearly in the elite tier of the style. It is subtle and complex and unique. That says a lot."
"Overall, this beer leaves me a bit disappointed. Don't get me wrong, it is flavorful. But on the whole there is just something missing. Mainly it is the lack of complexity commonly found among fine Trappist brews. Still, a nice beer, just not 'world class' in my opinion."
"A very good strong Belgian ale, full-flavored, malty, and delicious. The big downside is the high carbonation, which detracts from my enjoyment of all those smooth fruit flavors."
"Some elements in the glass are truly great but in general these different parts don't really form a joyful focused whole."
"for 5 bucks its something you definitely have to try. just dont get a beer from the pub and get this guy instead."
"O - Overall this is an excellent beer. Very unique for sure, I quite enjoyed it."
"Slightly cloudy in the bottle when held to the light. Poured into a New Belgium tulip glass. Thick frothy head; cream colored. Medium lacing and fingers around glass and edges. Dark brown in color with less lights looks almost black. Sweet caramel and belgian hops stand out the most to me with the smell. There is a hint of alcohol as well. Unbelievable taste. The cara malts and candy really stand out. It has a bit of a sweet beginning toning out to a mellow middle finishing very refreshing. Not dry or sweet. Definitely begging you to drink more. Lots of carbonation dancing around the mouth tingling the tongue and cheeks. Perfect balance of texture in the mouth. Not to watery or thick; just right. I don't think its quite as good as the 10 but it sure as hell is close. I will just rate them the same. I will say the 10 seems to mask the alcohol a little better than the 8."
"A flawless beer, maybe not a mindblowing one, but taste, complexity and great drinkability are those of a great one"
"Pours a dark brown, with a nice 1 finger caramel head. Looking forward to trying this one for the first time. It looks almost as good as the 10, maybe .5 off. Great smelling beer too- raisins, figs, fruit, spice, malt and alcohol come into play. Very similar to the 10 in smell if I remember correctly. The taste of this beer is exceptional- all the smells come into play here. Nice malt backbone, and everything is blended perfectly. Truly one of the better beers I've experienced. I'll have to have this and the 10 side by side at some point. Mouthfeel is amazing- Just right for this beer. All in all, a world class beverage- looking forward to trying this one again next to the 10."
"MD: More drinkable than the 10 for me but not as much as the 6. But hey i'm a double fan over triple and quads. For what it is, it is exceptional. Very velvety texture. recommended."
"A lot like Rochefort 10, but more watered down. A nice dark brown with mocha head that fades fast. Lots of dark fruits, plums, dark cherry, and dates. Caramels, toffee, and chocolates. Toasted bread, pears. The nose follows. Hints of woody, nutty, earthy notes. Very malty. Delicious."
"Scores -- Appearance: 4, Aroma: 4, Taste: 4, Mouthfeel: 4.5, Overall: 4.5"
"I really enjoyed this a lot and would definitely drink it again."
"DB- I like the overall flavor but it is just too sweet in my opinion. I usually never complain about sweetness either, cloying to me. Either way, it is a well made beer with one flaw that drags it down a bit."
"The mouthfeel was pleasant. It was full bodied, with medium (but pronounced) carbonation. Overall it was a very satisfying beer to sit and slowly enjoy."
"This beer is delicious. Its actually milder than many of the Belgian Ales. Its rich mahogany color and 1/8th in head has created a very nice looking beer. Small particles of yeast have affixed themselves to the bottle. Its very drinkable and a must have for the beer aficionado."
"D- Very."
"It is spring, so perhaps my sinuses are a bit compromised, but I just don't think this is quite what I hoped it would be. I'd pony up the extra two bucks and go for the mindblowing 10 instead."
"D: smooth smooth. and a pleasure to drink."
"Deep brown with light mahogany hues in the light, 1 1/2 fingers of tight white head, fluffy, good retention and good lacing. Smells of rich dark fruit, raisin, brown sugar, caramel, toffee, light candy sweetness, yeast, dark bread and a hint of alcohol. Taste is of Dark fruit, brown sugar, fig, plum, raisin, sweet sugary notes and a touch of warming alcohol. Medium, slightly creamy, smooth as silk and a good feel on the palate. Excellent stuff, rich and complex but still subtle and approachable, ABV well hidden, lush and enjoyable. Truly a world class beer."
"Delicious and complex. Fruity and refreshing. Drinks fully but not heavy."
"Drinkablity- I would drink this all ay everyday. Very satisfying."
"This is a great beer. Anyone that loves Belgian strong darks will love this beer. Anyone that is a fan of dark, complex flavors will love this beer. Anyone that's a fan of beer should love this beer."
"Poured a unfiltered muddy brown with bits yeast particles floating in it with a large light brown creamy head that had excellent lacing. The aroma was quite intense of sweet chocolate malts and an earthy yeast with notes of molasses, figs and plums. It tasted smooth and sweet with a slight acidic-alcohol flavor in the beginning and ended slightly sweet with hints of chocolate, dried friut and a mild alcohol aftertaste that lasted quite a while. Mouthfeel was medium to full in body and very creamy yet oily in texture with a surprisingly lively carbonation. Overall I can sum it up in one word, YUM!!!!"
"D - Very drinkable, complex, and surprisingly dark. There is a whole lot of toffee throughout both the aroma and flavor with spicy notes that are not quite as fruity as I would have expected. The clove in particular is quite strong and blends well with the toffee and brown sugar. The beer finishes very dry, but with just enough sweetness to keep the caramel from tasting burnt. Not as intense as the 10, but good nonetheless."
"Overall this beer is a classic for a reason. Well constructed, flavorful, deep, and still easy to drink."
"M/D: This beer had a perfect amount of carbonation, super smooth, even with as complex as this beer was, nothing dominated the overall flavor of this beer. It was one of the most well balanced beers I have ever had. Get a bottle with some age on it and enjoy this."
"This is very, very easy drinking for a beet above 9 percent ABV. I have to try the other two Rocheforts."
"D - Not bad, but I wouldn't want it every day. Very much a desert beer."
"D - It lived up to the hype. A delicious, outstanding beer."
"D: I really enjoyed this beer overall. While I noticed similarities to Rochefort 6, I definitely liked Rochefort 8 more. It seems the extra time utilized in making this beer made it better fit my taste preferences. If a longer brewing time brings about improvements for Rochefort's beers, then I am excited to try Rochefort 10 soon."
"This beer definitely tastes like an old world beer."
"D: This is the kind of beer I won't ever ""not be in the mood for"". Delicious, ""soft", smooth, and not overbearing. I do prefer the 10, but this is still one awesome beer."
"Overall, I would go for this over the 10, but I still don't love it. I will try the 6, but I probably won't have the 8 or 10 again. Either they are just not my cup of tea, or they don't live up to the expectations I get when I see they are rated higher than Chimay Grand Reserve."
"Pours a brown black with a big tan head that doesn't stick around too long. The mouthfeel is brothy with just enough carbonation. The bitterness level is low and there is no real hop aroma -- this is a malty, earthy beer. What can you say, it's an old school brew with mild pleasing flavors and a nice pleasant alcohol kick. Not an everyday beer... but one that is worth re-visiting every now and then so you can keep in touch with the long tradition of beer making."
"The CPJ"
"I would serve this with smoked meat, or something baked on a wooden plank, but nothing to acidic or sweet."
"Split a bottle of this one tonight with schmittymack at Rack and Rye in Denver (awesome food). Poured a murky brown color with a big tan head. Aromas of raisins, Belgian yeast, brown spices and dark bread. Medium bodied on the palate, with flavors of Belgian yeast, brown spices, raisins, dark fruits and chocolate. An excellent beer."
"Pours a very murky, brown color with a hint of red. Some sediment and what not floatin around in this beautiful dark brown beer. Large, frothy tan colored head. Scent is dark fruit (figs, raisins, plums, and even some grapes. I also get some very sweet malt aromas and a hint of booze. Taste is exactly as it smells. Amazing dark fruit flavors with this one. The figs and plums especially. Amazing malt characteristics with some classic Belgian yeast flavor. Hints of sweet chocolate as well. Everything is blended together so nicely in this complex beer. It's delicious! Mouthfeel is not overly carbonated, like I was expecting. Very full-bodied and flavorful. Alcohol is very well hidden in this gem. Drinkability is fairly high. I think I enjoy the 10 a bit better, but this is an outstanding beer."
"Very good, but no surprises here."
"D - This is almost as good as the 10 and a very well balanced brew that I would seek out again."
"D - Warming in the throat, pleasant. Mighty drinkable."
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied but it had a light effervescent feeling on the plate. The most enjoyable part of this brew was the feeling. It was smooth and light and beckoned you for another taste. Drinkability is good as the alcohol is very sneakily hidden by wonderful flavors and the balance between sweet and dry is wonderfully danced upon here."
"Fantastic beer."
"Pours a cloudy deep brown hue, lots of sediment. Just over an inch of head, but lingering only temporarily. Aroma is not very evident for some reason, which is a true misnomer for what's to come. Very complex taste, full of fruits, esters, some caramels, chocolate, and vegetation. Dances on the taste buds with dozens of flavors. Sweet, slightly carbonated, and smooth in the swallow, with a shy bit of warming character in the finish. Relatively full body, yet deceptively mild for 9.2% ABV. Obviously a brew that has had decades or centuries worth of knowledge imbued in its character. Highly recommended for a commercial dark strong belgian."
"D - A good beer but it's hard to drink it another immediately!!"
"A very nice ale with slightly underscored flavors playing to its advantage. The flavor mix is unique among this style for me but certainly appealing. To strong to drink a lot of but perfect for a slow sipper."
"Overall, I'd actually rate this a little below the Rochefort 6, which was equally complex but also more nuanced and drinkable. But even with that said, this is a beer any beer lover should absolutely seek out."
"D: Great. I'd order another and buy again. A good treat."
"D - Very drinkable, but not much more I can say. I enjoyed it, but I wasn't astounded. It was a good beer, finished clean, but it was less complex that I was hoping."
"D: Great. I'd order another and buy again. A good treat."
"D: At 9.2% this beer is very drinkable. It's too bad it doesn't come in bombers and is so expensive for a single bottle. The balance is outstanding and the flavors complex and interesting."
"Appearance is nothing too special - brown with no head. Smell is great - fig, molasses, and booze. Taste is great too and is appropriately balanced. This beer gets even better as it warms. Nice bitterness and roasts in the finish. Mouthfeel is very high and ABV is not noticeable."
"One of the best beers I've ever had easily, there was so much to taste and all perfectly balanced. This was also a very easy drinker."
"D-very nice. Almost too nice"
"Pours an orangish brown with a good amount of head off the initial pour. The head disipates fairly quickly and leaves a lot of carbonation. Smells yeasty and strongly of apple and spices. Tastes sweet and thick. Tons of spices and fruit flavours. Vry full bodied and tasty. A top notch beer"
"Drinkability - This is a great beer , well balanced and blended,nice creaminess with a great aftertaste. I'll be seeking out some more."
"The best beer I've had in a long time! Complex but mellow."
"This pours a really deep copper with a one finger head that dies down to a ring of bubbles with no real lacing. On the nose I'm getting a really complex mix of caramel, toffee, figs, bananas, and some yeasty stuff underneath. On the tongue it's a sneaky one, with nothing really jumping out at first, but then a mellow smorgasbord of the fruitier notes of the nose, mostly fig. In the mouth, it's a medium body but has a really pleasing alcohol note that hangs out for a good long while. It's not abrasive, just comforting. It's definitely drinkable but I wouldn't sit down and drink this all night. It's like an occasional pleasure for me. I like this beer a good deal."
"Must be a divine mix with strong cheeses."
"Drinkability: a great sipper. this is a very nice beer."
"Drinkability - The alcohol is damn well hidden in this, and I feel like I like this more than the 10 (I'll have to revisit it). Easy to down, and not overpowering as I would have thought. I will pick up another one or two to age."
"Drinkability -- Honestly, a bit disappointed seeing as this is the top-rated BSDA. Complexity of flavor isn't there and too much carbonation and alcohol. There are others I much prefer."
"Skal!"
"This beer is very complex and quite nice, but a bit too sweet/lacking in bitterness to be my favorite BSDA. Something about the balance is a bit off kilter for me."
"Completely fills your mouth with taste -- it's all encompassing! Pours with a stunningly beautiful head, unusual in my experience for a beer this dark and with such high alcohol content. The carbonation is very delicate, creating a satisfying experience as it interacts with sensors throughout your mouth. Kind of strange, but the dominant flavor in my opinion is banana. Excellent beer!"
"D: I could drink a lot of these pretty easily."
"D - lovely. one to appease the biggest snob yet also accessible enough for a great intro for an inspiring advocate."
"This beer poured a muddy, murky dark raisin brown in color with a light khaki head which laced the glass. I don't know what to think of the aromas. It's like nothing I've ever smelt from a Belgian dark. It is incredibly ""spicy", astringent, and kind of hard to deal with. It's like rubbing alcohol mixed with Thai food. I'm thinking this could be a bad bottle? Possibly infected? I don't know. The flavor too, like rubbing alcohol and spicy, giving me a headache. Oh my god I can't believe this. I'm sooo disappointed! It's nauseating. This bottle is awful, downright awful. It kills me to drain pour. I've had the others before but this is my first ""8". Apparently I'll have to try this again. When that time comes I'll revisit this review but WTF. $6 for this experience was horrible, and on my birthday? Come on."
"I wouldn't drink more than one in a sitting, not as drinkable as the Rochefort 10, but if you like a slightly more sweet/aromatic brew, this one is one of the best beers in that category."
"D- Easy to drink, you wouldn't even know that it was 9.2 ABV"
"What more can I say? If I could afford it, I would drink this every chance I could. How many ways can you say ""delicious?"""
"overall, this is an exceptionally enjoyable, complex but together brew - doesn't attack the senses, just caresses them...damn good."
"Overall, a disappointment. A shame, because I saved this bottle for last after splurging on a number of other trappists and more exotic ales. Might re-review at a later date."
"It poured into my tulip a slightly lighter than rootbeer color with a frothy head and abundant gyrating protein chunks. The smell was subdued but very pleasant with minimal distinct notes. The taste was crazy good. If only I could brew a beer that is as balanced as this I might never brew another style. Nothing was overpowering - not the yeast, not the grains, not the hops but the overall package was very flavorful. Again, the balance was incredible! The mouthfeel was just fine; not slick or sticky and only slightly dry, leaving the palette desiring another mouth full. Drinkability is addictive with barely a hint of the high alcohol content. This beer deserves its high marks regardless of what my numbers produce."
"Overall, this was a major disappointment. I drank this a couple of years ago and remember it being good, but this time it was a major disappointment. The flavor was just bland, mostly consisting of alcohol. It looks good, smells good, and has a nice mouthfeel, but the flavor was just not good. I don't think it is worth the price so I doubt I will purchase this again anytime soon."
"D: I only bought the one bottle from John's Marketplace in Portland. I wish I had more. This is a very tasty, very refreshing ale. Eminently drinkable."
"The M&D are great. I could drink this beer forever if i could afford it. It had a medium texture with a taste that makes you not want to take it down. I cant wait to try the 10!"
"Drinkability - not my favorite style but an excellent representation of a Strong Dark Ale and a good beer despite my bias. Its big brother (#10) is much better IMHO. The alcohol in this brew overwhelms some of its more subtle aspects, that said its still fantastic. Well worth a try."
"a nice slow sipper that should be savored and the changes should be noted as it warms. i could definatly see myself drinking this again, and i highly recommend. to me, no american attempts even come close to any trappist product. thinking about the history and the monks that brew this while drinking even make it that much more of an expierience."
"D - Extremely drinkable beer, though with the alcohol content this is definitely one to savour rather than session."
"D - high; this one goes down easy; if it weren't a higher abv, I'd want 3-4 in a row."
"Bottle poured into Darkness tulip. Dark brown slightly translucent body, slightly hazy, with a one and a half finger off white mocha head, good retention and some lacing. Smells of spicy belgian yeast, some dark fruits, raisins, slightly bready. Taste follows pretty closely, but is much more fruit. Lots of fig, raisins, bread crust, yeast esters, light cloves, a little bit of alcohol in the finish. Medium light body with a medium heavy carbonation. Although a bit expensive, this is one of the best dubbels around. This and Rochefort 10 are two of my go-to Belgian Strong Dark Ales. Good stuff."
"9.20% ABV. .33L bottle poured into a dimple glass. Pours very dark, cloudy brown with a big, pillowy cream-colored head. The aroma is clean and fruity: banana, berries, mild hops, and smooth malt. Big flavors in this beer including candy sugar, dark fruit, milk chocolate, caramel/ toffee, and bourbon. Phenomenal. The hops are a bit more present than other Belgians, and it makes an interesting complement to the rich vinous flavors. Another incredible and tasty beer from the St. Remy monks! I'd take this over the 10 any day."
"This beer is very complex and alcoholic, yet pleasantly smooth and easy to drink. Tis a true beer lover's delight and an ideal representation of the style!"
"Not a fan of the buttery component of the nose and it's too fizzy, but it's pretty tasty. Bottling code seems to indicate best by 4/15 i.e. bottled in 4/10."
"CHEERS!!"
"D: an exceptional beer and what the monks are all about make it that much more drinkable however it isn't an easy beer to find and that cuts down on it a little."
"Drinkability: Tastes insanely good, but due to the high ABV, I think to have another I'd have to pair it with the right dish to counter the way this one sneaks up on you. A great sipping beer and one to savor all on its own, but I think this would pair fantastic with the right dish. I've had this before but did a hard pour before I knew better and all the sediment came along for the ride. This time I poured carefully and some sediment came along, but I think minimizing it allows the greatness of this beer to shine through. I will definitely have this one again someday."
"This is a beautiful well balanced sweet Rochefort. It is very dark amber/brown, though not opaque and has a noticeable amount of sediment floating around. Full two finger head with a solid lacing as it disappears from the glass... when you turn it up you see a nice wall of tiny bubbles (can you tell I am enjoying it?). As I poured it into the glass the head started to foam over, so I slurped the head (grow up! lol) as not to spill any (it's not cheap) and the sweetness hit me right up front with the alcohol flowing mildly several seconds later. The sweetness gives it solid mouthfeel but not too heavy a to make it unsavory in any way. This is a dangerous beer in respect to drinkability as it goes down soooo smooth and balanced that the 9.2% could easily sneak up on you! This is one of the best beers I have ever tasted - ever! Enjoy and savor it."
"Not sure what I expected. Know this is supposed to be great. Maybe i just received a bad bottle or maybe my palate is not refined enough yet. Either way it leaves me disappointed."
"D -- Super smooth and well-balanced, but potentially hard to come by. Very drinkable."
"Drinkability: Not too dark. Not a sipper but definitely something one should drink slowly if not to just enjoy the beer."
"The sweet malt/high alcohol/Belgian trio damped it a bit for me, but with over 4 years to go, this may well improve with age."
"This is a solid beer and is drinkable. I believe that I like 10 a touch better."
"This beer pours a dark murky brown color topped by an off white foam on the surface. The aromatics are heavy on the floral notes from the yeast producing a woodsy fig note not overly bouquet. This beer tastes lightly of plums and woodsy notes. There is a nutmeg and clove spice that sits on the tongue and seems a little to much for my buds, though it's still pleasant. The mouthfeel is pretty smooth, but the carbonation is a little on the strong side. I'm pretty pleased with this beer, but I do however feel that it's slightly overrated."
"D: The fact that the alcohol is hidden so well make this a candidate for having a few, until you realize that the 9.2% is definitely there"
"Without adoubt, the best beer I've had n 2010! The smell reminds me fine French Champagne, doughy änd soft. The taste is simply magnificent, toasty, malty, it simply hits all the right chords. Mouthfeel is very smooth but not dull or flat . I would drink it every day if I could afford its steep price."
"D - Drinkability is low and almost non-existant. Unfortunate that my first encounter with this Trappist is a fail, but at least it's (relatively) available, just a bit expensive. My first encounter with a butter-bomb and it's not pleasant!"
"Overall, I love the beers that Rochefort puts out. I prefer 8 with less than a year on it now, but this brew remains one of the best of the Trappist."
"Drinkability: An awesome beer and something I wish I could drink everyday."
"Overall, a really excellent beer. I had trouble finishing one glass, considering it is very heavy, but also very tasty! I still have 3 more bottles, and I'm excited to see how the flavours mature over time."
"While not generally a fan of Trappestes, the initial aroma of this beer is outstanding! Pours with a frothy foam that sustains for a good while. Good feel and solid taste- I could enjoy this at any time. Enjoyable enough to make me rethink my feeling towards the maker."
"Bought this at Boonton Liquor Outlet in Boonton, NJ. Into a snifter, it poured a cloudy brown, with two fingers of tan head, decent retention, and good lacing. Smelled of lemon, strawberry, melon, caramel, and slight alcohol presence, but overall of lighter fruits, which was a bit surprising, given the dark appearance. The taste was a nicely blended mix of melon, strawberry, and tangerine, followed by cocoa/coffee, and then finished on a dry bitter orange peel note. Alcohol was better hidden in the flavor than in the nose. The feel was smooth, and not as carbonated, with a very bitter and dry finish. Very pleasant and complex yet balanced flavor profile make this one a keeper. Would love to age some."
"Well, it's about 2:30pm and I'm drinking this on an empty stomach so halfway through the glass I'm already catchin a little buzz. This one boasts a 9.2% abv and it's not kidding. It's one of those perfect beers that will keep you warm on a rainy winter day like today. Only downside is that the price has gone up from $4.99 to $5.49 for a 330ml / 11.2 oz bottle. But, if you can find one - I highly recommend it. I saw some on the shelf today and bought the entire stock. (they only had 8, go figure)"
"D - the flavours are distinctly Belgian and very rich, at 9.2% this stuff is dangerously delicious, an exceptional strong beer"
"Overall, a really nice trappist beer. The warming alcohol mixed with the smooth maltiness really make this worthwhile. I definitely recommend this."
"It's a good beer, but I was a touch underwhelmed vs. some of the other Belgian classic brands."
"This is just good beer. I was afraid it wasn't going to live up to the hype, but I'm thoroughly enjoying this, and regretting I only bought 1."
"D - Very easy to put down. Clean, dry, refreshing and very flavorful. A very well balanced and delicious beer. Certainly world class."
"D - This is one of the easiest to drink strong ales I have ever had. I guess the Monks know what they are doing."
"D - I really enjoyed this one, and I am really glad I scored a bottle in the beer exchange. I will most definitely be trying the rest of the Trappistes line and would highly recommend this to any fan of Belgians."
"The taste is incredible. A creamy feel on the way in that quickly changes to chocolate, raisins, and alcohol. The alcohol blends perfectly and adds a great flavor on its own."
"Huge amount of head after pour. Maintains good amount of head throughout that adds smoothness to the mouthfeel. Cloudy dark color. Brilliant clean, crisp taste. Dry with sweet and sour notes reminiscent of dry champagne. Very drinkable. The high alcohol level is hidden behind a very easily downed brew. Amazing!"
"As I poured this beer, a nice tan head formed just to the top of the glass, it was really fizzy and the head dissipated very quickly. The colour of the beer is a murcky, swamp watery brownish. The smell was of sweet caramelly malt with figs, plums, other dark fruits, some spiciness, and alcohol. The taste was about the same. I did have a problem with the alcohol taste, it tasted more like a shot of liquor in there (vodka) than the usual you get in beers. I also picked up some metallic taste and mouthfeel. I think I will revisit this one again."
"Full bodied falvor with slick moutfeel and semi sweet finish."
"D: Well rounded, very enjoyable. Its not the 10, but its still very good."
"D: this is a perfect dessert beer, or perfect if you just like incredible beers! Nobody does it quite like the Belgians. This really makes me want to try a Westy."
"A little expensive and boozy so drinkability will go down a bit. It's a good beer, but doubt I'll be rushing to grab me another one. It's pretty accessible but I'd rather go for the 10. Still good none the less but the smell is it's best trait IMO."
"drinkability: fantastic belgian, it was a little young (brewed in 2010) but overall one I will always go back to."
"Pours a deep caramel brown color with good head. Good balance of hop bitter and malt sweetness. Taste is chocolate and spicy with a slight bitterness. Finishing is slightly hoppy with a long lasting chocolate and malt flavor. Easily one of my favorite Trappist beers."
"Pours a dark cloudy brown with a fizzy carbonated head that recedes quickly, no lacing. Particles floating..? The nose is bready malt, sweet dark fruits and strong phenol. On the sip I get a great tasting, smooth beer that tastes of a well balanced yeast and malts and the dark fruits. Very easy to sip, medium bodied. The high ABV is well hidden. Great looking label/bottle, perhaps not worth the high cost/bottle though."
"D: If not for the price tag, I could see myself sipping this for hours on end. While an excellent beer for sipping, it would fill you up quickly if you just knock them back, so this high drinkability rating comes specifically with the style in mind."
"I would drink this more often if I could afford to."
"big tan head with huge retention. Smells wonderful. Very spicy and fruity flavor, this is a perfect example of a well executed trappist ale. This is very fizzy brew with some subtle sweet chocolaty or brown sugar notes. One thing is for certain, Belgians know how to make beer!"
"Drinkability -- Honestly, a bit of a letdown. How is this the top-rated BSDA? Depth of flavor isn't really there, a few off flavors, and the mouthfeel is too light and spritzy."
"This is a great beer, and I'm thoroughly impressed. This beer has lived up to its reputation and I will be sure to pick this one up as often as I can. Although this beer is close to 10% I just can't stop drinking it. I'm trying to savor it nice and slow, but there is something about it that keeps me coming back for another sip, another drink. I suppose that might be due to the dry finish, but I have been won over by this one."
"Smooth moutfeel with good level of carbonation. Too sweet to make it highly drinkable for me, but only by a small margin. Outstanding belgian brew."
"The flavours here are just about perfect and the beer really shows it. This is a pleasure to drink and one of the best crafted Belgians I've had."
"That's what it seems to say on the bottle..."
"Drink-ability - I could drink a lot of this in a cold January night."
"D: The complexities and full bodied nature of this drink hurt the drinkability, but the masked alcohol bring it back up."
"D- so. here we sit. more or less halloween saturday. no spooky beers or creepy beers or vampire stuff or nosferatu that my distributor has been out of all f***in season and instead something i've been saving for a special occasion and this is it. too drinkable, not the fainest hint of alcohol except a pineapply essence that has my head light and lifted. the monk on my shoulder chimes in and says 'trappist excellence'."
"Mouthfeel is perfect, amazingingly good lacing and bubbliness for the ABV which in undectable while chilled, but becomes apparent as it warms. Better than the #6 so far, will have to sample the #10 soon to complete the trifecta."
"Good beer. Well balanced and delicious."
"10>8 but 8 is amazing in its own right. so drinkable and crisp."
"Interesting beer. Has a complex aroma. Notes of fruit, malt, and caramel hit the nose. Good sweet and bitter balance, with the carbonation preventing the sweet from overpowering. The carbonation also gives the beer an interesting finish, which fades nicely. The only knock for me is the body, the beer is just a bit thin for me."
"D - to me it is the high alcohol that keeps this rating down. a very nice beer, but I do prefer #6 better as it has a better balance."
"Taste wise it was really nice, some candied cherries and malty caramel, maybe a little darker fruit esters. As it warms just a little bit of the alcohol can be tasted. The mouthfeel is spot on, carb level great and it drink wonderfully. The ABV can be detected just a bit, especially as it warms but I really enjoyed this beer, much more so than the 6."
"Serving type: bottle"
"It's nice but I was expecting a display of Belgian mastery."
"Definitely the little brother to the Rochefort 10 but still a solid brew all around."
"Overall, great beer, it was a pleasant experience and i would buy again"
"Poured a gorgeous dark brown with a massive light brown head that looks light a big round rising loaf of bread. Holds shape nicely. Aroma is sweet and brown sugary. Nice dark dried fruit flavors. This tastes like raisins! This is slightly warming with some light hints of spices. Smooth and medium bodied. Yes this is great, id rather go for the added kick of the 10 though."
"Overall, I love the trappist style and this is the best representation I have seen of this style. Incredible."
"D - For how sweet this one is, it's got fantastic drinkability. I had a craving to try it so I ran out and got this one and I'm certainly happy I did! Sipping this awesome beer on a cool day is perfect!"
"Trappistes Rochefort has a cloudy, brown colour and a good head that lasts. It smells quite sweet and citrus hops. The initial taste is quite sweet honey but as it stays in your mouth it just gets maltier. This beer has as a nice medium body and the carbonation gives it a bit of froth in the mouth."
"Bottle. Best date of 220414. Pours a murky brown mahagony color with a very fluffy white head that quickly settles to form a nice coaster. Solid aroma of caramel, toffee, and slight touch of alcohol. Some spice notes as well. Well carbonated leads to a medium/light mouthfeel. Raisins, caramel, and tofee dominate the taste as well as a warming alcohol taste at the end. Some nuttiness as well with some bitterness lingering. Carbonation level slightly takes away from the overall enjoyment of this beer."
"Drinkability: for a 9.2% ABV beer, the alcohol is hidden very well. I would limit myself to one because of the sweetness."
"F/D - Moderate carbonation with an extremely smooth texture due in part to a thickness that is just right. Keeps the mouth watering for more as it entices the pallet. One of if not the best beer I've ever had the pleasure of drinking. Still need to try the Rochefort 10 though."
"Drinkabilty - I could drink this daily but, no way i should cause i would be spoiled from all other beers. This aint the insane quad 10 that rochefort makes but its right behind it. World class, only 10 is above it"
"O - superb. A revelation. Best bottled Belgian beer I've had, including the Rochefort 10."
"Pours a murky brown with a 2 inch tan head that quickly recedes to a thin lace. Noticeable sediment at the end of the pour. A divine complex sweet smell not quite as strong as molasses, but more noticeable than brown sugar. Hints of nutmeg maybe, or cinnamon. Maybe figs. The mouthfeel is sharp and bubbly, but very nice with a slight warmth. The taste is sweet and sticky like dark sugars and cream with dark fruits and a slight nuttiness. Even at 9.2%, this beer is remarkably easy to drink and making a very good case for being my favorite beer."
"This is a beer you want to drink. This is a beer you want to share with people. It's high alcohol content brings smiles fast, it's welcoming look, smell and taste will have brows raising. This is a beer that you'll look forward to having time and time again. Instantly became one of my favorites, and makes me want to go back to big brother number 10 to see if I missed something."
"Notes: Some might mention sediment or yeast, but it is important to let it settle to avoid it intervering with the flavors of the beer. A proper pour along with a week of settling in the cellar help."
"mouthfeel is luscious, medium plus bodied with average carbonation. for a BSDA this is insanely drinkable."
"D: Good overall, far too much carbonation for the thickness."
"Though the flavors and aroma were not quite as upfront as I was expecting, this is easily the most drinkable Belgian dark ale that I have tried thus far. And while the flavors aren't as powerful as I hoped, they are still quite complex and enjoyable."
"Overall: a really really good beer. Lots of complexity and flavor. Very delicious. I like this one alot more then 6 and now I'm licking my chops to try 10. As with 6 when the sediment is poured In tons more flavor appears. Would definitely drink this again."
"Pours a pretty clear slightly dark brown/burnt orange color with a moderate tan head. The head faded to a veil pretty quickly. Although the smell is not powerful, there are quite a few different aromas picked up. I get spiced apples, bubblegum, banana bread, raisins, and some cloves. Tastes are fairly similar, yet in a slightly different order. The clove hits first, followed by a burnt caramel, dark dried fruits (I smelled the raisin, but the taste is of cherries and figs.) The finish is slightly dry, but presents similar to a chardonnay. It's a grapy bitterness combined with a bit of alcohol. I really liked this facet. I was disappointed by Rochefort 10, but the 8 made up for it."
"D: Yes yes and yes."
"D: Very good."
"D: The alcohol is over 9% but it is very well hidden. This is a spectacular Strong Beligan. Lots of malt flavor that blends exceptionally."
"Drinkability: Although complex and with a high ABV, it's very drinkable. But for the cost."
"Overall, a very nice and drinkable beer! You might want to sip on it as it's deceptively easy to drink."
"D - Quite excellent. I got through the bottle pretty nicely before I noticed any real alchohol presence. This is one that I certainly will not pass up again in favor of the 10."
"Before I knew it, my glass was almost down to nothing! With a very unique and pleasing flavor profile and a superb mouthfeel, this is quite a drinkable brew. The 9.2% ABV is masked very well. Definitely the best example of a Belgian beer I've had yet and it almost certainly raises my interest and expectations of the other Trappistes Rochefort beers."
"Overall, a pretty good beer."
"Deep mahogony color, rich browns. Little plum of carb floats on top with a ring of off white head. The aromas are lots of dried fruits, raisins, prunes, cherries and cranberries; also dark belgian candy sugar and sweet estery belgian yeast. The flavor is heavily fruity and kinda sweet without being cloying. Rich and malty and still a bit dry. This beer feels buttery in your mouth with just the slightest amount of carb. A little hot from the alcohol but otherwise lovely on a cool evening."
"It's a very good beer kind of strong for me the alcohol make me feel like I'm drinking a hard liquor, but it's a round beer that it's going to need a couple of tries before the final verdict."
"I thought it was a pretty good beer, although for the price I can't see myself returning to it for the simple fact that I believe I can get beers that are similar to this for a lot less money. That said, I did enjoy it for what it is."
"Taste is similarly incredible, complex with lots of zingy herbal wood, rich caramelised bread & spices, lots of rich fruit, esp. plums, caramelised dried fruits. Mostly balanced, it has a faint lean to the sweet side. Despite strong flavour and rich complexity, it is incredibly easy to drink."
"Mouthfeel is smooth with a medium body feel. Overall a great BSDA there really defines the style."
"D- complex flavor mixed combined with the mouthfeel is awesome!"
"5/2/2.5/3/3"
"Overall/notes: Once again, Trappistes Rochefort absolutely blows me away. Perhaps it's a notch down from their 10, but it's not a big difference. This is a must for any beer drinker, really. It made for great company while I was doing my homework."
"Carbonation feels very crisp but passes quickly, a bit like a quick shot of grapefuit soda. Finishes feeling very nicely balanced. The 9.2% ABV is superbly hidden in the flavors and lingering aftertaste. This would be quite drinkable except for getting plastered from the high ABV. Great stuff, which there had been more than just 1 bottle left at the store when I got it!"
"Pours a dark hazy amber brown with little chunks floating around. Tastes of burnt brown sugar with bready malts lingering. Very delicious. The mouthfeel and finish was quite smooth and so damn easy to drink. I was very impressed with this beer. I would love to try more again soon."
"Overall: BEAUTIFUL. Simply BEAUTIFUL. A spectacular, world class Trappist that you know right from the first sip, that this beer is a labour of love by the Trappist monks. I raise my half-empty glass to them in respect."
"Go out and get one right now I havent tasted something this good in awhile"
"D - Drinkable beer that masks the 9.20% alcohol very well but it should be quite obvious that sippng this beer and letting it warm up over time will provide more enjoyment and quite an interesting roller coaster of flavors. Very dynamic and complex flavor profile to this beer."
"Overall: I was blown away by 10, but I am not by 8. This is a well crafted beer, but it seems to overly sweet to me. Maybe I am drinking it to warm, I don't know. Certainly something I will keep trying, and still worthy of the Trappist name. Perhaps it is my own lack of understanding or appreciation that causes my reaction to this beer, for I have hesitation in doubting the monks' ability to craft incredible ale at the Rochefort monastery."
"As far as strong ales (or Dubbels) go, this may be the best offering I've had. I'd give the Colorado bottles a B rating, but the Ghent serving was definitely an A+."
"D: I could drink bottles of this and enjoy it the whole way through."
"D- easy to finish this bottle. i think i prefer this one to the rochefort 10. oh well. i really enjoyed this beer."
"Creamy and dessert-like, this is an after-dinner sipper to say the least. Complex and damn tasty."
"Drinkability: This beer was actually a disappointment to me. I was looking for a nice, smooth, trappist ale and that is not what I got. This one lacks aroma, isn't very deep flavor-wise, the alcohol dominates a bit too much, and is too heavily carbonated. This is a good beer, but I don't see it as up to par with other trappist brews. I would have it again, though not if other trappist ales were available ahead of this one."
"d: for having the 9.2 abv it goes down easy, but it is thick just like the appearnce. over all a very good beer, that is a must have."
"Poured into a goblet for dark borwn body w/ minimal tan head that died quick. A thick malt presence in the aroma with caramel, cocoa, hints of toffee and roasted malts along with some breadiness and a touch of yeast. Fruit flavors are barely noticeable. Very sweet is the first impression I get. Creamy and smooth with a chocolate, caramel, toffee, and something akin to maple giving off sweetness and some bread/roasted malts balance and give off a dry edge. Some carbonation thanks to minor hop bitterness also lead to dry finish and there is a touch of fruit, like candy fruit or something, that is also in there (I keep thinking orange and grape). Touch of peppery spice as well. A real sweet but balanced ale that has a little bit of something for everyone and is just a must-try for anyone."
"D: There is potential in this beer to be a lot more complex and bold, but I guess that's what 10 is for..."
"jd"
"Overall: Top notch beer. They don't get a whole lot better than this. Buy it when you see it. It won't disappoint."
"D: Very rich and delicious. Fruity and complex but not overly sweet or syrupy. 10 is better, but this is world class. Great to sip in the evening."
"D - Amazing and complex brew, could sip on this all night! I do, however, prefer the 10 to this, the 10 being more of a dessert in a bottle. Still, this is a delicious beer and one of the benchmarks of the style."
"Goes down easy, and is neither too strong nor too filling. A beer you could sip on all night."
"A truly world class beer."
"It isn't quite as complex as the 10, but it also has less of an alcohol bite. That being said, it is also more dangerous than the 10, as the 9+% abv is well hidden. Truly a great beer."
"Drinkability is pretty good, it had some great flavors to it and was a nice treat to sip on after dinner tonight. Very good beer overall and one of the best of the style."
"Drinkability: Good, this beer won't fill you up, though the residue that is left at the bottom might add up. If you can find it for cheap, then by all means indulge otherwise skip price tag and find another beer to drink"
"Poured into a Sam Adams Perfect pint glass. Brown with a glowing amber color very hazy. It had a volcano of a head absolutely spewing. Orange/amber in color and huge. It goes away after about 10 minutes and there's a ring around the top. The smell is the best part in my opinion. Not overly yeasty as some Belgians tend to be in my opinion. A little malty with some smells of dark fruits and even a little grapey slight hop finish and a touch of alcohol. The taste brings it down a notch unfortunately, still ok, but nothing like the smell. This bottle is about 3 years old and according to the best bye date on the side, I still have another year and a half. The dark fruit tastes are not as strong and there is an earthy taste that provides a little more bitterness than desired. I don't taste it anymore after about 10-15 minutes but there was a metallic flavor that goes away once the beer warms up a little. The mouthfeel is slightly better than average, that same earthy taste makes it actually feel a little dirty which brings the drinkability down a notch too. I'm still not the biggest fan of this style, but this is certainly a good brew. The smell is the best part in my opinion. I'm sure I'll get it again as I expand my horizon's but for now I'll leave it as is."
"D - ""Meal in a bottle..."" Not inclined to over-indulge, but only because a second would be less appreciated than the first."
"Tasted from 11.2oz bottle from Famous in Lombard. Pours a cloudy dark brown with a thick but quickly receding off-white head. Nose of red fruit with some banana and caramel. Flavor is red fruits with toasted malt, cola, and a slightly salty note. There is also a hint of nutty oxidation. The body is medium with fairly light carbonation and a medium cola finish."
"Good drinkablilty, great example of the style."
"D - Not as good as its ""big brother"" in my opinion but still a great beer."
"Overall not as mind blowing as I had hoped. Still very good."
"Bottle. Dark murky brown pour with a thick, lasting white head. Tobacco, rich ripe grape and plum aromas thick with some roasted barley aromas and nuts. Some alcohol and yeast in traces. Sweet sticky toffee taste with rhum and grapes, nice complexity. Beautifully full and mellow mouthfeel."
"Overall, a very good beer that lives up to it's reputation but not likely purchase again due to the cost and not being my preferred style."
"This is a drinkable beer that goes well with barbecue or even caramels. This is not that sessionable, however, as the 9+ percent ABV will sneak up on you."
"A very potent offering with a strong darker malt sweetness."
"I poured into my glass to fleeting off white head. It is brown and clouded with yeast. The smell is spicy and for some reason reminds me of apples and cinnamon. I get some caramel malt in there, too. The taste is malty with a spiciness as well. It is not as viscous as I expected. There is an abundance of carbonation. It goes down pretty easy for the ABV."
"All in all, this is a fantastic brew. So many flavors and scents bouncing around in this brew. If you like Belgian's then the Rochefort 10 and 8 are a must. Even if you are not a Belgian person, I think you will enjoy this. Awesome!"
"Spicyness instantly contrasts with the sweet alcohol and fruity esters. Grainy malt and fresh bread tastes complement this brew as well. Medium-body feels heavier with the intense carbonation. The brew has a smooth, and slightly sticky mouthfeel. Drinkability is world-class."
"M&D: full-bodied, smooth, and creamy with less bubbly sting than expected. Mild and pleasant alcoholic warmth hits towards the end of each sip for a truly remarkable beer experience."
"MF/D: Not an overly-filling mouthfeel but smooth on the way down with little carbonation, which leaves a lingering tingle of persisting flavor at the back of the throat following each sip. A very good Trappist ale, will continue to get occasionally to fill a mix/six."
"Overall, I really don't know what else one would request from a Belgian Dark Strong. Truly sublime. I will say from a little bit of experience that this freshness tones down the deep pruniness and sweet grain, replacing it with a bit more bitter and yeastiness without the heavier phenols. Possibly one of the best Belgians (and beers) I've had for some time."
"Pours a deep amber-brown colour with off white head. Lots of dates, raisin and caramel in the smell. Taste has a great Belgian yeast flavour with the dark caramel malt and fruity raisin flavour. Really a delicious beer. A very smooth mouthfeel, almost a bit creamy. I finished this bottle probably much faster than I should have."
"This is not something I'd want to drink all day or night, as it's quite strong. This is something with which I'd wish to finish off an evening. I think it would be great with steak, ribs, or perhaps a nice pulled pork doused in spicy barbeque sauce."
"I do like this beer, not sure I could drink it in mass quantities, meaning I could do one 22 and be good for a night with it. But very solid, you can taste the quality, and also bonus points for the unique but good taste. I am glad I tried this."
"Complex sweet flavor, just what a Belgian Dark should be."
"Made a note to try again later. My least favorite of the 3 Rocheforts."
"pours a dark brown orangish muddy color that is heavily particulate. Fair white head, fair lacing and average carbonation. smell is caramel and nutty. taste is the same with some chocolate burnt toasted hints. medium body and long flavor duration. sweet chalky finish. alcohol is well hidden but will creep up on you. probably not worth the ten dollar price tag i paid for it, but none the less delicious."
"Drinkability is ok, I could drink one or two, but very good beer"
"D: An exceptional beer, not quite on par with the 10 but still very good and easily among my favorite BSDAs. I am planning to set a few of these and 10s back for a few years more."
"Not exactly cloying, but more-so than preferred. Rochefort is quite impressive, but I can't see drinking more than one. Too sweet, unfortunately."
"Overall - I think I like this one more than the 10, if only for the perception that it is a bit more subtle and I could drink more of it. Woe be to me when I find a bar that has this on tap -- I'd be broke, jobless, and homeless since I'd never want to leave."
"Notes: I can't help but think of the 10, looking forward to have it again, and the 6, which I am yet to try. While I adore the complexities of the quad this has a roundness that makes it rather special on its own."
"Notes: Best before 14/10/14. Very nice beer that I very much enjoyed. Plenty of fruit and some dark malt have a wonderful taste and are well balanced making a good example for the style. A good amount of phenol/medicinal taste also present, but adds a bit of a kick. Licorice is fairly strong for the style. Overall a very enjoyable and solid beer from a great brewery. Not quite as good as the 10, but very nice in its own right."
"Served from bottle into a Chimay goblet. Poured a nice amber brown with a three-finger white head that slowly subsides to one-finger. There was nice lacing evident throughout. The aroma was comprised of roasted nuts and sweet malt. The flavor was filled with malt, spice, and alcohol. It was medium on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this is an excellent brew. If the appearance of lacing and head retention were better this could be way up there in the ratings. If you haven't tried this, you owe it to yourself to."
"I poured this beautiful ale into a bulb glass and let it sit for about twenty minutes. From the first taste, this beer never let me down. Mellow feel, not too hoppy. All around strong drinkable ale. Has a darker color, and the head on mine, didn't stick around long, but other than that, if it were'nt so expensive I would buy it as my daily drink."
"T--Has a coffee taste mixed with a chocolate celery. Very, very interesting. Extraordinarily complex."
"Taste is malty. I'm tasting rum cake, some spice, banana, vanilla. Lots of complexity. A must try Belgian beer. They one I'm drinking has about a year of aging on it. The finish is smooth and has a lingering cinnamon like aftertaste."
"I like the 6 and the 10 but this one just did not do it for me. I am a big fan of Belgian strong dark ales so I was surprised that I wasn't really digging this one."
"Excellent brew overall, enjoyed more than Rochefort 6 and--according to my rating--more than the Rochefort 10. Guess that means I'll have to revisit the 10...!"
"D: Exceptional beer, and I would not want to ruin it by having too many. This is a special beer that is meant to be savored occasionally, and it is very clear. The smell and taste beg for you to defy this, however, and the alcohol gently reminds you not to."
"Drinkability is a little hard to judge. There's no way I could follow this one up with another, but I did like it when I had it. A substantial beverage, to say the least."
"Dangerously drinkable at this ABV. Great complex brew. Could easily put a few back and enjoy each."
"Pours with a thick, cream-colored head. Slow to dissipate. Body is a medium brown with bubbles rising throughout. Smell and taste is very heavy in malts and dry fruits. Mouthful offers a long, smooth taste that goes down very easily. Very good Trappist and lives up to the recommendations I received."
"Overall respectable offering here. Freshness maybe questionable. Drink does take a hit on drinkability due to sweetness of drink. Personell style preferances a bit different than the drink offers, however can appritiate drink. Worth taking a look at."
"Very enjoyable to drink. Feels higher than a regular brew, but not quite at the 9.2% ABV it actually comes out to. Good for a couple drinks, either alone or with some food."
"This is an amazing brew and an impressive beer!"
"This is a wonderfully drinkable ale. The alcohol is evident, but well matched by the strong flavors."
"D- This is better than having a great dessert. It is smooth, complex, bitter sweet, and leaves you wanting more. I only bought one so I took my time drinking it because I want to enjoy every single drop; knowing that is all that I have to drink."
"The Rochefort beers are some of my favorites, very rich and complex, a treat to enjoy."
"poured from a 330 ml bottle it poured a dark ambe colorr with a full 3 finger head that recedes very slow... the smell is strong spice and fruit and yeast and vanilla...the taste is spice and currant fruit with vanilla bean very sugary and sweet a little caramel..the mouth feel is thick and sweet a little too sugar taste for me ..its very drinkable @ 9.2 not detectable its a slow sipper and a recommended one..not my favorite strong especially at the price point"
"D - I could barley finish it. Not one of my favorites. I enjoyed the Rochefort 10 much more."
"D - Pretty fantastic beer. Very big beer though. Probably wouldn't have more than one of these in a sitting, but one that I would definitely have again."
"This is a nice Trappist, Not as great as the Rochefort 10, but a lighter and dryer representation from the brewery. Still the medium viscosity mouthfeel and tightly packed fine carbination, but with more drinkability, well, relativaly since this is still 9%. perhaps losses some of the complexity of the 10,especially with the much dryer finish, but steller in its own right. There is a huge spicy Gingerbread note on the finish, and some light yeast, malt,and a big earthyness also. quite enjoyable, almost tastes like a christmas brew to me."
"Drinkability (4): I would not want to wake up after few bottles given the high volume of CO2 with almost 10% of Alc."
"Cheers!"
"Drinkability: Complex, yet very approachable. Gotta love the monks."
"D- A really classic example here. Nice strong ale."
"D: It's very easy to drink for the high level of alcohol content."
"It was good, but quite honestly I'd rather have the #6. I was kinda disappointed because of how much I really liked the #6, this is still a very fine brew, you can taste the complexities in the brew which really shows how much work goes into the brew, but give me the #6."
"Cloudy mahogany colored pour with a classic Trappist huge pillowy white head. Dark fruit aroma, not as chocolaty as the 10. Tannic notes, brandy, and spice popping out also. Earthy sweet malt flavor with lots of dark fruit, a little tannic, a touch of cherry and brandy, well hidden alcohol. Medium body with a tingly carbonation and a slight alcohol warming on the finish."
"Enjoyed this with brie, gouda, and whole grain crackers."
"Tastes like a blend of chocolate, figs, dark herbs, vanilla. A delicious sipping brew. A true special occasion beer."
"Occasionally, the startlingly dry conclusion can overpower the other flavors, but it's not entirely unappealing and there's something intriguing about the warmth that each sip of this brew provides. It doesn't seem to be the easiest beer to drink, but it's one that is thought provoking, original and far from bland."
"With a ripe cheese and fresh bread this beer makes a truly good meal."
"Overall, you can do a lot worse, and maybe not much better, in a Belgian Strong Dark Ale."
"D: Very nice, but by no means my favourite of the variety. I was honestly a little disappointed. I'll try one on tap some day, and maybe I'll revise my opinion."
"it in overall beauty."
"Drinkability is high, not overwhelming but pleasantly warm and smooth."
"D: What a great beer this is. I enjoyed every last drop of if and hope I can get it again soon."
"Pours an auburn brown with a thick creamy head. Smell is a nice blend of vanilla and raisin with a large malt profile. Taste is huge malt, some booze, dark fruit and vanilla. The mouth feel is very thick and syrupy. Drinkability is high - very good beer."
"D: Very drinkable, as most good Belgian Strong Dark's are. Alcohol is well hidden."
"This beer (in my opinion) trumps Rochefort 6 (and every other BSDA I've tried so far), and is on the same level as the 10. Amazingly complex, delicious, and highly addicting!"
"D: Very enjoyable and drinkable. Alcohol is not overpowering."
"A very fine beer. I'll try the 10 next time and see how strong these guys can go as this is already really potent stuff."
"D - Trappist brews are one of life's finer things. Enjoy them. I do."
"I love the Trappist brews, but this one is definitely my favorite."
"I served this next to Westmalle's 8, which was not even close to the same league."
"All told, it isn't a bad beer. Generally, it is a good beer that if it were more reasonably priced would be a nice changeup from the ordinary belgians that I drink. Still, it's nice to support this industry."
"I would seriously consider getting a tattoo of your brewery's motto: ""Curvata Resurgo"" (Curved, I straighten up)"
"Very drinkable and enjoyable. For all the flavors and amount of sweetness this never becomes too much."
"The taste is soft, the alcohol is not overpresent. The head disappears after a short while. Not really sure what i tasted for ingredients but the combinatioon ao them all was good."
"D: overall a different, very enjoyable beer. but, for me, the high alcohol level mixed with my preference for different-style beers limit the drinkability for me."
"This beer is quite heavy and hearty. Very enjoyable, but I can't see myself drink more than one this evening."
"The dryness and easy flavors makes this beer go down well. I had someone try it that claims that it was a little dark for their tastes and low and behold they thought it was really good. I think I won over another to craft beers."
"Mouthfeel, the body seems to get lighter throughout. Good. Kinda drinkable. This definitely is not my style of beer, but must recognize that it is well made, and exceeded my expectations."
"D - Drinkability is medium for me. Alcohol is pretty high at 9.2%...it is noticeable, but not overwhelming. Gotta like the malt to have more than one of these...I'm more of a hophead. Overall enjoyable on a lousy rainy/snowy evening in February. Worth a try for sure, but not a go to beer for me."
"This is a dangerous beer...very drinkable, very tasty...I'm quite sad that I only had one and I have no idea where I'll find it next."
"d - Overall this was a good solid dark ale. It did not have an overpowering smell or taste, but had a nice mixture of sweet malts, yeast, and molasses. Considering it is over 9% ABV it is very easy to drink, the high carbonation being a small factor in that. Would definitely try again and look forward to trying Rochefort 10."
"M/D- very smooth, medium-full bodied beer. very silky and coats the palate, making way to a long finish. i'd drink this any day of the week."
"The mouthfeel of this beer is amazing. The dense foam gives way to a pleasant and natural feeling carbonation that is deliciously creamy, and reminiscent of a root beer float. There is not much heat, which is surprising for a 9% abv beer which made this one go down pretty easy."
"This is probably now one of my top two or three favorite beers. I loved almost everything about it; the large chunks of sediment were a bit strange, but with a beer that tastes like this, I really don't care!"
"Pours a dark, hazy mahogany with about a finger of light ecru head that leaves a good amount of lacing behind. The smell is delightfully sweet, with hints of orange, grapefruit, molasses, sugar, and figs. The taste is a.lso sweet, but in maltier sense; hints of syrup, apple-cinnamon, figs, nutmeg, and brown sugar are all present. The body is nicely medium and smooth, making this brew very drinkable and highly enjoyable, no matter how high the ABV wants to say it is."
"D-Great beer. A bit big to have a couple in a night but a great example of a belgian dark strong. I like the 10 better but any of the Rochefort beers are a great pick."
"It's a very drinkable beer and I have been enjoying a tulip glass full of this stuff. This review is no revelation, I'm saying pretty much the same thing as everyone else. One darn tasty brew."
"D-very tasty and great body. smooth on the palate and nice flavors that work very well together. the alcohol shows through somewhat; but not much at all."
"D - Moderate to almost low drinkability. Mainly because this ABV is fairly zingy, and the carbonation makes it very feeling."
"Overall a very very drinkable and enjoyable brew!"
"330mL bottle poured into a chalice. Hazy dark brown color with lots of sediment. Tan colored head with excellent retention and good lacing. Aroma of fruit and sweet malt, with a little bit of licorice. The flavor is very malty and sweet with molasses, dark fruits, yeast, and some alcohol. Medium bodied with a smooth mouthfeel. Overall, this is not my favorite Trappist, but this is still a very good beer."
"Poured from an 11.2 oz bottle into a goblet. Appearance is very similar to the Rochefort 6, cloudy amber with some sediment, however the 8 has better retention on the head. The nose on the 8 is also much more robust, with belgian yeast and dark fruits. After a few sips, caramel, brown sugar, and alcohol are the primary flavors that jump out. Also notes of spice and coffee. Mouthfeel is thinner than the 6, with a medium carbonation. Drinks nice and smooth, with a touch of warming from the alcohol. A great beer!"
"D: Hands down, Rochefort's brews are amongst the best I have ever tasted. This beer, despite it's body and strength, is extremely easy to enjoy. Certainly DOES NOT SUCK!"
"D- Very balanced! solid flavors that cooperate and make this extremely easy to finish...definitive for its style. This ale was a pleasure to consume."
"D- A touch more balanced than Rochefort 6, a very easy drinking Belgian Strong Dark."
"Pours a slightly hazy dark brown, almost a mahogany, with a fairly thick pale tan head that sticks around for a little bit. Strong, malty aroma has an undertone of spices and some fruity hints. Flavor is mainly malty, subtly spicy and fruity, with just a little bit of an alcohol nip. Texture is very smooth yet a little rough on the edges. Worthy!"
"I recently tried the Bernardus Prior 8 and consider that to be the better drop!"
"Picked up a bottle for Thanksgiving, hadn't had it since the original review and wanted to give it another try. Didn't even notice til I got it home that it was 18 months old. Great flavor here, it's got that classic deep dark fruit/dark bread/Belgian yeast thing going on that the Trappist beers do so well. It feels a bit boozy at first but it starts to meld quickly. A slight flaw is the mouthfeel, feels overcarbonated but that also improves a bit with time. Doesn't quite match the 10 but a great beer in its right."
"D: For a beer this big this is absolutely a gulper. I'm glad my bottle is small because I would definitely be in trouble right now otherwise. This beer is a masterpiece."
"Pours murky brown with an off-white head. The aroma is caramel, sugar and dark fruit. The flavor has quite a bit of grape with some other dark fruits, caramel and candi sugar. The sugar is pretty forward in the taste. Somewhat boozy. Medium mouthfeel and high carbonation. A very good beer, but not as good as Rochefort 10."
"M - Viscous, substantive."
"M,D- Pleasant, but hindered by an aggressive level of CO2. I will let the next one flatten to a degree first."
"Impression: Took 110 bottle returns to score this, but I will be looking to get another 110 quickly so I can score another. A must try for those who love the complex and interesting flavors Belgians in the Trappist traditions offer."
"drinkability: overall its a nice belgian ale and ranks up there with the worlds best. slightly less than anticpated though. can;t wait for the 12. maybe tomorrow."
"Overall, a very nice and drinkable beer! You might want to sip on it as it's deceptively easy to drink."
"A nose that almost automatically evokes chocolate and coffee if you let the beer sit in the glass. It also reveals a hint of fig. A taste and heady, reminiscent of the liquor, and more specifically fruits macerated in alcohol. It is first in first mouth full bodied but then quickly becomes soft and chocolaty or fruity. The finish is long with a taste of cake and chocolate and leaves an incredible number of flavors on the tongue. Beer complex."
"Pours a dark brown, hazy and opaque, little bit of red is visible, small off white head and lots of lace. Smell is cherries, chocolate, molasses, apples, some toffee and a little bit of alcohol. Taste is rich chocolate, dark fruit, sweet malts, some liquorice near the end, then some more chocolate and a bit of alcohol. Mouthfeel is nice and chewy, very warming with a dry bitter finish. Very tasty."
"Even with a 9.2 abv this beer just goes down so easily and smoothly. Lots of dark fruit flavors, raisins for sure, it has that great Belgian yeast flavor. A gorgeous, complex beer."
"Spicy, medium body, sweet and peppery (is that allowed in a beer review). Beer bites me at first, a big shock. I'm thinking I should grab a few of these and age them for years. Drinkability is good and mouthfeel is good. Second taste, beer is a little thin for my expectation, taste is pretty good, a little bready / biscuity, not as aromatic or honey like as I expected. Overall a good beer but not my favorite trappist."
"easy drinking for the the abv but a little bit off. I think I would like this more if it were less attenuated."
"The world class reputation matches the flavor."
"An easily drinkable beer but I was a little aggravated with the amount of sediment I got in this beer. It was almost like I had gotten the bottom of the barrel in my bottle."
"This is obviously not an every-day drinker, but this stands out as one of the best beers I've ever had, and while, at about $6 a bottle in the states, I don't see myself buying this often, I would be incredibly grateful to take it off any of my friends hands if they happen to have a few sitting around."
"Poured a dark murky brown with hints of red, big carbonation and a nice dirty white head. Nose is great, booze, dried fruits, mainly dark ut I did taste grapes? Taste followed the nose very closely but the taste was incredible, spice, fruits, booze. Drinkability is perfect and spot on."
"OVERALL>Easy drinking special treat. More bitter and less sweet than expected and than most Belgians of this ilk."
"Rochefort and Orval are the 2 beers I buy for myself every time we land in Benelux area."
"Overall, if you can get your hands on it, which I know you can if you try, please do yourself a favor and grab it and savor it. Cheers."
"this is definitely a beer to be had in large quantities. a sipper, definitely enjoyable that way."
"D- I could drink this often. Only one or a couple a night would do, but if my wallet would let me I would drink this all the time"
"This is a good beer, but I was a little disappointed. Glad I tried it, but I'd rather get a 10, or an Abt 12 any day of the week."
"D: WTF!?! Is it possible to find a shitty bottle of this stuff lying around somewhere? I sure hope so, because this beer was thoroughly unimpressive and more than a little disappointing. Light in flavor, lacking complexity, and an unappetizing appearance made for a lackluster beer. However, there were no off-flavors, skunkiness, or funky esters, so I've got to question if this really was a bad bottle. Since this beer is rated so highly, I will do my best to track down another bottle and adjust my ratings accordingly, because I have a hard time believing this is the same beer."
"Drinkability: A very good beer. While the alcohol is well masked it is not totally hidden. A decent sipper, but I was not blown away like I was with 6."
"This and westy is the best in the world for me. and this 1 I can buy in the states, I cleaned out a few places for this, so merry xmas to me."
"Drinkability-This is definitely more of a sipper than the #6, I couldn't have more than a few of these."
"D and overall impression: Drinkability is just ok for me here. It is just overly sweet. Overall, very good example of the style. The appearance will take a hit from the abundant sediment, but when I'm in the mood for a belgian, which isn't that often, I'll look to pick this one up. Skal."
"kind of an average example of the style, but i like the style so its all gravy."
"(D) very drinkable beer, not sure i would want to drink this all the time."
"It's an excellent sipper, and lives up to its reputation. I wouldn't want more than one at a time, though, it's not that kind of beer. It's funny that this is considered the weak sister of Rochefort 10, because it's pretty damned potent in its own right."
"I poured from an 11.2 ounce bottle into a snifter. Even though I poured slowly, this was a fizzy one. After the ridiculously huge head settled, a deep murky beer apeared. I was underwhelmed by the aroma, alcohol and bread. The flavor is high on alcohol, some sweetness and a malty bready backbone. It does have a creamy mouthfeel, but is overcarbonated for my liking. A decent sipper, but I was very disapointed by this."
"Poured into a tulip- an opaque brown with a slight hint of red and a tanned foamy head that lasts. Earthy nose, with a nice mix of raisin/ dark fruits and malt. Well-balanced taste- the fruit notes and bitterness pair well with the alcohol. Nice thick velvety mouthfeel. Slightly alcoholic finish, but nothing to overpower the balance of this beer. While I personally prefer the 10, this is a fantastic brew, worthy of all its praise."
"O - One of the best Belgian Strong Dark Ales, and worthy of being one of the most notable Trappists."
"O: unique fruitiness, very dry, could be lower in acohol, great beer"
"Overall this is a nice beer but doesn't rock my world. Top notch but not life changing."
"O: Definitely not on par with 10, but a good beer overall. It seems to lack the strong fruit character of other Belgian ales, and that was a bit of a disappointment for me."
"D- A bit too much carbonation if you ask me. This is still a very well crafted beer. Huge on the bready and yeasty malts. Enjoy this in moderation."
"This was outstanding and exactly what I wanted from this style. I cant wait to try the Rochefort 6 and 10."
"O: Absolutely drinkable. Simply delicious. A winner, ever!"
"I couldnt session this, not in a million years. Then again, it's a trappiste strong ale, so why would you."
"D - Kind of on the heavy and sweet side, but could do more than one."
"D: The high alcohol content, dryness and astringency make this more of a sipping brew. it would go nicely with a hearty meal."
"Had at Mokafe in Brussels on a cloudy afternoon. The waiter poured it with a perfect head without even looking. Lots of figs and raisins in the aroma. Lovely dark ruby color; looks quite dense just sitting in the glass. Raisins galore in the taste along with dried pears; some apples and a nice bready overtone. The alcohol, while quite high on paper, is nicely hidden and does not impair. A memorable Belgian beer."
"D: Absolutely top-notch. It's not quite in the league of 10, but that's no knock against it. Highly recommended."
"Great beer be hard to not want to drink more."
"(D)- A great belgian that just flows with rich dark fruits. A crisp feel with its fizzy carbonation level. A real winner & a great representation of the style. Tons of flavor; I really dont think my description of the taste does it justice."
"D- I truly enjoy this beer... it is not the first time I have had it... and it certainly won't be the last. I shall always consider it a ""classic"". However, I couldn't have more than one in a sitting as the yeastiness (and alcohol) could become a bit overpowering with time."
"Bottle. Very cloud orange/brown pour. Aromas of varied malts, fruit, slight alcohol. Rather yeasty, but not in a bad way. Malt, raisin, bready flavors, solid medium body. Very clean finishing. Drinkability is good even with the abv and not overly sticky. I generally don't care for very many Belgians, mainly because I find them WAY overcarbonated and closer to champaigne than beer. This one however, was excellent and closer to an old ale style. Though I do prefer the 10. Worth it."
"D. Very well crafted beer. Nice flavors and body. Would have liked a little stronger smell, and I prefer this style a touch sweeter. This is a Very good beer."
"the finish here is warming from the semi high abv and followed up by a subtle sweetness and trace of nuttyness again. this is a wonderful beer and could be enjoyed day in and day out for me, a truly wonderful belgian"
"D - Intoxicating both literally and figuratively. The smooth drink-ability combined with the complex changing flavors and smells tell a tale through this beer that one can't ignore. There is something in this beer for hop-head, malt lovers, and yeast cravers all. This beer is best enjoyed by itself."
"D - Amazing brew!!"
"D - This is a very good beer those monks know what they're doing great taste worth getting your hands on to try"
"Mouthfeel is light-bodied and generously carbonated as there is a good amount of bubbly feeling on the tongue. Drinkability is moderate and definitely a sipper. Good classic example of the BSDA style."
"D- A wonderful, mind-opening drinking experience. Rich complexity of malts, with just enough yeast and hop balancing. You can sense something new and delicious with every sip."
"This is a dark beer boys and girls. A big, plumpy off white head sitting atop this monster. The nose is very cool with dusty chocolate, bread, raisins and a fair kick of prunes. A little sip reveals a massively complex mix of chalky, chewy, malty, baked bread and prunes again. Quite dry, low carbonation. This is the real deal. I friggin love this beer."
"I decided to do a Rochefort - Westvleteren challenge when my buddy mailed me a bottle of Westvleteren 8 on his trip to Belgium. I have had the Rochefort before so I decided to refresh myself there first. First off the appearance is amazing, a dark amber hue with a thick creamy head that is retained almost throughout the entire glass. The aroma up front for me was pretty much equal parts yeast and spice, with a hint of sugary fruits as well. And the taste, well it's pretty much exactly what a belgian ale should be. You get more of the belgian yeast and spices, as well as hints of cherries and molasses. All perfectly balanced, and the alcohol was hidden almost completely. The mouthfeel is very crisp but not biting. The whole combination allows you to drink these down very easily until the abv puts you on your ass."
"Dark plum color, medium light tan head with some persistence and good lacing. Aroma of raisins, dates and malt with some vanilla. Full mouth, taste of malt with raisins, berries and dark fruit. Bittersweet finish. Well balanced and complex. A classic."
"Extremely small head. Very nice appearance and resembles the 6 degree and other Trappist brewery brews I've had. Was exceptional as far as taste, smell, and mouthfeel. This was an all around awesome brew. I got a nice taste of cola and molasses, but it was too overwhelming. As with all these Rochefort's I've had they are well-balanced. Extreme drinkability and even with the 8% plus ABV it didn't taste like it and I love that."
"Drinkabilty is good. Smooth belgian beer that is quite warming during the winter months."
"Very drinkable for a higher ABV."
"D= Overall I was a little disappointed with this beer. The color was off as well as the smell. Maybe I came in with high expectation but I thought it was lacking in those two areas while the taste was still great. I'll buy it again just because the taste is great though."
"I think that I will go down to the store and buy some more of these and age them for several years and review again."
"Drinkability: Tons of complexity and character (as well as alcohol), but just not as good as I had hoped. Regardless, I'm sure I'll buy this again in the future."
"Drinkability: There is no doubt this is a drinkable beer. Each sip leaves me wanting another. There is no question I'll have another bottle of this. The only question is when. Given this ABV its probably good to limit consumption to one a night."
"Took me a while to taste this, and that's a good thing. Flavor is appropriately sweet and is again fruit forward. Cherry, plum and vinous grape notes abound. Carbonation is just about right for the beer. Light in body yet pleasant and moderately complex in flavor, yielding a decent feel and a strong drinkability."
"In short, despite the intensity of the beer overall, it kept me wanting another (which I unfortunately did not have at my disposal). Fantastic beer."
"Overall, what a great beer Easy to drink, complex, and delicious. $5.80 for the 11 point whatever ounces. Don't be cheap, because this is worth it."
"this beer is worth looking for, its very complex and will make you think while drinking it"
"Mouthfeel is medium with generous carbonation. Very smooth and creamy. Fairly drinkable, although unless you just have a real appetitite for the style, I think it'd be difficult to drink a ton of these. It's just quite filling and interesting. Certaintly not made for chugging or sessioning."
"Pours a deep dark reddish brown. Soft pillowy head. Smells of plum, cloves and sweet raisins and a hint of alchohol. Taste is a complex mix of dark cherries, plum, and raisins. The alchohol only adds to the warm flavors this brew has. As it warms it becomes an even smoother feel in the mouth. A great beer for sure! A great example of this Belgian style."
"Overall: Another great brew from Rochefort. Completely different from Rochefort 10, which is more sweet. This beer is fantastically balanced, with some nice spices. Extremely rich in taste! I love it"
"Leathery, well carbonated."
"D-I'm not a huge fan of Belgian darks, but this is one of the best beers I've ever had. Gets better as it warms up. Simply amazing"
"D- Delicously drinkable. I can see how monks replace meals with this."
"D: Excellent. As it warms, it gets better, actually -- starts to taste almost soda (cola?) - like. . . ."
"Overall, this is a fantastic brew and one that I'm sure will make it's way into my fridge quite often, as long as the store nearby keeps it in stock. Very complex and tasty brew! Highly recommended"
"- Overall this is a very interesting brew... and I can tell it is very old, and complex... and I am sure is always brewed with great care. Pairing well with steak."
"Well... I had very high expectations, and well, as this was a good beer, It did not blow me away. There was no freshness date, and while it is 9.3% ABV and should keep well, there is a good chance this one had been sitting for a while at my local liquor store. I had it poured from the bottle into my Rochefort chalice. Dark plum with some brown thrown in there. a good three finger head that slooowly went down after a while. Medium heavy in body, it has a good feel in the mouth. This beer seemed very spicy, almost too spicy. Very complex, but that spice was just too much for me. Very good, thought it would be very great..."
"Procured at Beverages & More, Valencia, CA"
"Awesome beer. One of my favorites."
"Drinkability is OK - it's not thick and chewy like you might expect from a 9% brew."
"Drinkability: Just what you expect, a superb Belgian Dark Ale. All three of the Rochefort release beer are fantastic, and just need to be tried."
"Not a big fan of the sediment at the bottom. I know it's kind of a novelty and it's not bad for you but it bothers me towards the end of a glass."
"It's September in New York as I drink this beer for the first time, I have just picked and eaten the seasons frst parsnips and frozen, probably, the last of the tomato sauce, and this beer just fits. It's like a harvest festival in a glass. It is warm and comfortable like dried fruit, ""The Last Of The Summer Wine"". I'll be laying away plenty of this elixir, alongside the falls root crops, to while away the winter by the fire."
"Cheers!"
"D - Fairly high for the style."
"Drinkability: I love the flavor, but the high alcohol, dry, astringent finish and complex, sophisticated flavor profile all combine to make this a once-in-awhile sipper at best."
"D- beautiful option for those who want a good Belgian without tons of funk. Alcohol may be a little too prevelant for a beginner but for a Belgian lover this is a great one to check of your list."
"Jordan."
"Puors a great dark brown color with some nice indigo tinges; has great head and wonderful lacing. Great deep scent, hints of fig and other fruits, with a huge malty ester. Deep, deep flavor, with a slight spiciness and a great fruit hit; big on malt, no real bitterness. Goes down well for being such a big beer, but there is a huge alcohol taste in the finish."
"It was a good beer that I enjoyed slowly. I do have my first Rochefort 10 in the fridge, though, and I hope it is more impressive than the 8."
"AGED (3 years): Amazing aroma as before, more concentrating on honey, toffee, caramel, and chocolate though. Very complex. Flavours seemed to have dried out, but the alcohol is reasonably well integrated now."
"D: I see some similarities with the R10 but still good enough to stand on it's own. Very rich in taste for a medium body. This beer I could drink a few on one evening unlike the R10 that usually finishes my evening."
"D- High ABV makes it hard to drink more than one but every sip left me wanting more."
"The feel of this beer is quite pleasing. It is light, a bit tangy but well balanced."
"Doesn't have quite the boozy kick of it elder statesman '10,' and comes off better for it. The bready sweetness comes off very well balanced here - and I think I ended up enjoying it more than 10."
"D - Drinkability. See what I did there? The carbonation really helps out here. I can't really discredit the ABV considering the style. However, I would prefer some more bitterness to help balance it out overall. One bottle is definitely enough. If this were the middle of winter and it were cold, then, well, I could be persuaded to have another."
"All in all a good beer, I don't know what took me so long to try it, maybe i'm just stupid."
"This beer pours a majorly cloudy chestnut brown with a two finger of extremely lively off white-tan head. Head retains well leaving nice spotty and wispy lacing on the glass. Nose is of fruits, yeast, caramel, brown sugar, and some honey. Taste is full of alcohol and dark fruits up front. Very malty still but with a lot more yeast, almost a gingerbread type brown sugar taste. Over-ripe bananas and a pear flavoring make up the finish. Medium bodied, moderate to high carbonation, somewhat of a creamy and smooth texture to it, really coats the tongue. This is a great beer to sit with for a bit - well blended and complex flavoring."
"4/4/4.5"
"D - very strong licorice and spice flavors combined with a great mouthfeel that balances the alcohol"
"D- as good as it can be, at 9%. Better than most beers of higher ABVs, that's for sure."
"Drink- I could drink this heavenly beer all day long till the break of dawn."
"Poured into Westmalle glass dark dark amber with a thin off white head. Scents of grapefruit and strong raisin smells come from the glass. The taste has more of those raisin flavors that mellow out to a wooden oak taste. Lots of carmel malts as well. Very little hop flavor, if not none at all. The mouthfeel is a little odd. While there isn't much visible carbonation, once it enters the mouth I get the feel of champagne with out the tickles of bubbles. It almost takes away the tounges ability to taste the flavors. The alcohol is very well masked, which makes it much better drinkablilty."
"Very malty and a little sweet. No bitterness and again some raisins and spicyness. I didn't do a great pour so I got some floaties in it but it's still pretty solid."
"Now I'm excited for the Rochefort 10, and am going to pick up a Rochefort 6, as well. There's a reason this beer is so popular, every BA needs to try this masterly crafted beer."
"This may be my overall favorite beer. If I could afford it, I would drink one every night."
"I'm a fan of 10, but was disappointed by 8. I did not feel it had any outstanding characteristics, but was instead rather pedestrian."
"D: Another fantastic Rochefort beer."
"Overall...go for it. I'll be drinking this one more often without a doubt. Still doesn't do the sames things as the 10 to me but really now? That's a different ballgame, I suppose."
"D-I could drink these all night long if cost wasn't a factor."
"D: A fantastic beer, a good trappist-beer. If you havn't had it yet - what's your excuse?"
"Pours a cloudy brown color with a large tan head, over 3 fingers worth. Leaves a nice sticky lace. Has a lot of sediment in the bottle. The smell consists of caramel, alcohol, spice, and fruit.The taste is like the aroma. The alcohol is noticeable, and the flavor is sweet. Medium bodied, nice carbonation, creamy, and has very good drinkability."
"This is a seriously delicious trappist that everyone should try to seek out."
"This is a world class beverage, seek out."
"11.2oz. bottle served in my Chimay goblet at 47 degrees. 171213 08:36 indicated on the label. Poured a hazy plum with a dense, two-inch off-white head with excellent retention and consistency. Nose is dark fruit, berry and some chocolate notes. Taste consistent with nose, but some acidity comes out in the mouth and flavor profile is muted and flattened. Mouthfeel is just shy of medium-bodied with a very lively and consistent carbonation from beginning to end and and a slightly dry finish. A solid example of the style and very pleasant to sip as an digestif."
"Pours a very dark brown with a big rocky persistent head. Smell is mild notes of dark caramel, chocolate, and dark fruit, with a touch of alcohol. Taste is similar with dark caramel with touch of deep roasted malt. Bitter chocolate. Background sweetness. Grapes and raisins. Apples. Some earthy yeastiness. Some booziness in the finish. Medium bodied and highly carbonated. Very drinkable. An excellent Belgian beer."
"For $6 cheaper a beer, I'll sadly drink more R8 then R10."
"3.5 D: Why this beer is in the top 100 is beyond me. I liked it, but it cost way too much for how mediocre this is."
"Overall complex and hits the palates in all sorts of directions. This is the most enjoyable Trappist I've had as of yet."
"D: Tasty, goes down very easily, not too filling, strong kick, very good representation of style, this is a good stronger Belgian beer that is worth drinking for while until the ABV catches up to you."
"D - Super drinkable stuff for what it is - the ABV is super well hidden, the carbonation is style-appropriate but not in your face, the taste and finish are really satisfying. High recommended stuff."
"This is an incredible beer, truly one of the best. I purchased 2 bottles of the 10 (all they had left) and I can't wait to try it. I plan to sample the 10 with both the St. Bernardus 12 and Chimay GR to try to determine which I like best. Right now I like the 8 best of all, so my anticipation for the 10 is great."
"An awesome beer. Just as good if not better than Rochefort 10."
"I've been holding on to this bottle for a while, but after having sampled a number of other Belgian and German offerings of late, and getting out of my IPA-heavy comfort zone, it seemed appropriate to bring out the heavy guns - so what the hell was I really waiting for?"
"5oz pour at the Flying Saucer Tri-Beer Belgian tasting served in a tulip glass a crisp dark red with a decent off-white head that diminishes to a ring. Aroma is a slight amount of cherry and dark malts. The taste is a nice amount of sweet fruits and malts with slight spice. The beer is on the heavy side of medium with slight carbonation. This is a very enjoyable Belgian beer."
"I'm finding that good beer is both complex and drinkable at the same time. This came to my local bar and I figured I'd try it while I could. I decided to try the 8 because the 10 seemed to imposing on my young palet, but after trying this I think the 10 could be much more aproachable. This astes quite good you do notice the extra alcohol but it's not over powering. If you get the chance, even if you don't like darker beers give this a try."
"Like Rochefort 10, our Trappist brewers who talk to God have brought a little bit of manna from heaven (though unlike the Israelites I would hope I would never tire of Rochefort 8 or 10). Keep it up brothers."
"Overall, I think this is one of the more complex Belgian ales I have had. Lots of unique flavor and every sip is a little different. I will review the 10 tomorrow to see how they stack up against one another. Overall, a pretty solid brew, even though I am not the biggest Belgian ale fan. Recommended."
"nice belgian lacing! this beer is great!"
"The taste was less complex compared to say a blue chimay, but very delicious and the beer felt much more creamy and well balanced. The 9.2 ABV left a little warmth in the throat but nothing else. It tasted sweet and caramelly, with hints of coffee and chocolate. It felt like a more drinkable beer than the other trappist beers of this kind I've had, but I only bought one, which I regretted afterwards. Overall I must say it's one of the better beers I've had, an absolutely awesome beer. Go get it!"
"Overall I wasn't too impressed and probably won't buy this one again."
"this is very drinkable. and with the high alcohol content, which really hides itself well, it could really get on top of you."
"The beer is very smooth and drinkable, pleasantly balanced. I do wish the fruit tartness were a little more present to give the beer a slight sour note."
"This one definitely disappointed me. I know I had a 60 minute right before this, but the taste and smell were just plain lacking in character. Nothing like the 10 or even any other trappist I've tasted."
"Drinkability is good but could be better. Enjoyment is not nearly as high as it should be."
"Overall, a very good beer that makes a nice treat, and a good change of pace from the hoppy West Coast IPAs I've been having lately."
"Drinkability: Moderate to high, but I think I honestly prefer the 10 to the 8 as it was definitely much more flavorful."
"Really a nice, complex beer. I would definitely drink any time it was available and would delight in it - though I am not sure if it ranks with the best of the best. Still, can't detract - a great beer."
"OVERALL: A decent brew, but nothing worth writing home about. Like the Roch 6, this one doesn't even approach the class of the Rochefort 10. A brew I'd have again, but wouldn't use cellar space to keep in the house. Unfortunately, this one is probably more hype than anything else."
"Overall, this is a good but not great beer. For me the 8 is a mere shaddow of the greatness that is Rochefort 10. Both are no match for St. B apt 12. I'm a bit dissappointed but glad that I can still be surprised; even if it's a bad surprise."
"D: The flavors in this beer are great, but the super tingly carbonation got in the way far too often. Lower the fizz, and this beer would be amazing."
"drinkability is scary - after this beer you dont want any other the rest of the night"
"d: one of the finest examples of Belgian beer out there. The monks of Rochefort know what they are doing. This is a great introduction for those looking to get into Belgian beer or good beer in general. Rich, complex and balanced."
"D=very good, not an overpowering taste, light sweetness, gentle aftertaste all lend to good drinkability"
"D: Suffers from the heavy sediment and a blunted nose/flavor all around... Will have to try again, in case this was a defective bottle... Just didn't feel right... what a downer"
"33cl bottle from Systembolaget. A dark red/brown beer with a clear body and a good sized lasting head that matches the label. Streams of bubbles trail up the glass toward the surface. This is at this point in time probably the best aroma of any beer I've had. It's simply amazing: raisins, cherries, grapes and yeast come leaping out at you, and then an extremely potent cotton candy/toffee aroma last till the very end. The flavor is not as complex, but is very inviting, with porty/winey character. It's sweet, but not cloying, with very restrained bitterness. Maybe the best part is that its not to thick; a little syrupy, but overall finishes clean and easy. I would drink a few more of these if I could, which is dangerous considering the alcohol, which only makes itself known with a warming in the throat. This is an amazing beer."
"The mouthfeel is the typical luscious fluffy character of the Belgians with a bit of slickness as well."
"Trappist beer - what a treat, always. Usually drink stuff like this with a few friends but having this alone on a dreary rainy night has it's own merits. This beer is not really anything special to the eye, so pour quickly and get on with it. Ruddy, murky brown with kind of a poor head compared to others in the style. But it is immediately redeemed by the complex aromas flying out of the glass. Malty and rich, spicy, raisin. Bready and yeasty flavors here. Spicy and herbal hops float atop a nice Belgian style malt base and finishes juicy and full. Nice soft sweet finish. A world class beer for sure, although I have a few, but only a few, others in the style that I would pick first."
"This really fills the mouth, noticable carbonation and an impressive finish."
"D- Good stuff, gets better as it goes. I like it."
"Truly a classic for the style, this is one that I like to pick up on my beer runs. Still have not had the patience to age this guy for five years."
"Much more entertaining than Chimay and most of the other doubles I've had out there."
"A very solid offering. I think I like in order the Rochefort 10, then 8, and then 6."
"From 330 ml bottle into chalice. Pours a deep, cloudy brown. Drinking this at around 55-60 degrees. Not as much ""silt"" as the 6 had. Moderate carbonated head mostly diminishing, but not as much as the 6. Lacing throughout as opposed to zero for the 6. I am drinking a beer that the gods long for! I agree with another reviewer - the aroma is pretty mellow, more to me than the 6. Malty, figs, raisin, alcohol evident on the palate and in the finish. With that said this is quite an enjoyable brew - wow! It has me standing erect and saying ""aye man this is beer - down with the wine laddie"". Do the monks drink this before, or after Mass? Cheers to the Trappist Monks at Rochefort, Belgium! I think I'm hammered!"
"D: dark fruits, light malts, candied flavors, and awash with alcohol. A little disappointment in my heart, but not much. It is tough for me to consider this as a world class brew. I am not giving up hope, I am gonna have this one again"
"Fruity, bready, earthy and clean. Extraordinarily complex."
"The Abbaye St-Rémy monks must really love to brew."
"Overall one of my favorite beers. Combines elements of both Dubbels and Quads in my opinion. A lot in common with big bro Rochefort 10 but by no means a '10 light'. This one has enough of it's own thing going where I'll often crave it in it's own right."
"(Edit: Added points to appearance, for having a great head all the way through!)"
"D- I will go for the 10 from now on as it is more richer in flavor and feel but this was a great experience. Either way this is high in ABV so no more than 2 in an evening if it is available."
"Tastes like some light brown sugar alcohol concoction. Sugar coated apples, dark fruits and raisins. Mouthfeel is typical A+ bottle fermented Belgian, but a little more carbonation would be nice. This was a June 08 bottling and I would love to try an older bottle. This is a one and done beer for me but a nice hour long sipper."
"8 is a great beer that pairs very well with chocolate cake, brownies, or other rich desserts. Its ABV is up there, so sip and enjoy."
"Drinkability - Extremely drinkable, especially for its' strength."
"D - This is a good beer. The ABV is well hidden."
"Rochefort 8 poured very heavy and there was much yeast and sediment in the bottom of the glass after it settled. This did not deter me. One of the best smelling beers I've had thus far. The taste was phenomenal and reminded me of what beer was meant to taste like, very yeasty and hearty. I should also mention that the buzz this stuff gives you is great. It leaves you feeling goddly. Thank you Trappist Monks!"
"D: This is one great beer. It's really well balanced and carries some fantastic aromas and flavors. Highly recommended."
"It is a very drinkable beer. Even though I liked it, I would not drink it frequently. It tastes a lot stronger than 9.2 percent. I am afraid that if I had two of these in quick succession that I might fall under the table."
"Best before 16-08-12. Relatively fresh. Dark amber brown body with an enormous, 3 1/2 finger head that fell ridiculously slow, becoming dense and rocky, and left some nice, webby lacing on the glass. Smell is fantastic. Big time yeast and grass, floral, apple cider, dark fruits and a hint of boozy rum. Flavor is very nice. It's not overpowering like some BSDAs, but has a nice medium body. Flavor mostly consists of bruised apples and spice, hints of rum, dark sugar, raisins, banana, and has nice, dry, herbal and grassy finish. This beer is complex and very well-balanced. So far, I'm liking it better than the 10. It gets better and better as it warms. What a fantastic brew. I'm loving sipping on this one slowly even though the alcohol is barely noticeable. Way to go monks of Abbaye de Notre-Dame de Saint-Rémy!"
"A very sophisticated brew. Not overdone in any dimension, and it's almost impossible to detect any alcohol. It's just sweet, refined and haughty. A delicious adventure."
"Quite sweet on the front, with a creamy flavour, but hops kick in on the mid palate and stick around for the back. To be honest I think this is too chilled, but there's enough flavour coming through. Quite smooth and decently flavoured with a slight element of something on the palate I can't quite pick (my bad). Very drinkable, mouthfeel is very smooth and with subdued, pleasant flavours."
"Pours a hazy dark red/brown color with some ruby highlights. The head comes up to about 1.5cm and is loose and bubbly, leaving tiny amounts of lacing from the swirls of tan bubbles that stick around. Looks like I've come to expect. The smell is deep and dark. A bit of bready malty sweetness, tossed in with chocolate, a hint of carmel and even dried dark fruits and esters. There's quite a lot to look for, and it stands up to my expectations for the style. The taste is nice and very complex like the smell. A taste of dark chocolate and caramel mixed together comes through first, with the sweetness if caramel beating out the bitter/roasted kind of taste from the dark chocolatey malts. I'd even say I can taste sweetened, very smooth coffee. Then I get a taste of esters, and the fruits: plums, raisins, but more like the generic, non-descript fruity tastes of esters. Then it finishes with a bit of sugary sweetness, but definitely not cloying. On some sips, it actually finishes with a little dryness. That's a quality I've really come to enjoy: being surprised by what I'll taste next. The alcohol is hardly present, but it warms a little. The mouthfeel is so full, and there isn't a thing, even with all of the complexity, that I do not enjoy in here. Goes down very smoothly and the carbonation is pleasant. The alcohol doesn't hit you quickly, and this beer just begs you to keep going. I think I like this better than the 10, and easily my favorite from the style to this point. I was happy to have it, and I bet you will be too."
"D,this is a world class beer! extremely drinkable one of my personal favorites . highly regarded as one of the best beers to have,stock up on this one ."
"Absolutely wonderous, Rochefort 8 is a truly unique and appropriately holy experience. World-class and highly recommended to anyone and everyone who enjoys a good quaff."
"D: it's a bit of a sipper, but frequent sipping is necessary...more complex than the Chimay blue, I wish I had more than one bottle"
"Overall one of my favorite beers .Recommended."
"D: Definitely a sipping beer to be savoured. More than two and you're pressing your luck."
"One is good for me. I really don't see myself drinking more in one night."
"D: Very delicious and easy to drink, but I'm not sure if the value of this one is enough to justify the cost of drinking a few of these."
"D - Lack of complexity makes this an easy drinker. The high carbonation helps as well."
"D - Extremely drinkable for a 9.2% ABV beer. In fact, I would say this is the most drinkable beer over 8% I have had, a testament to the balance."
"overall i thought this was a pretty awesome beer, i think it lived up to the hype. Can't wait to try the 10."
"D = Extremely drinkable. This one is a troublemaker."
"The drinkability is there and at 9.2%, it is wickedly drinkable."
"Not knocking this beer by any means, this is one I will visit again, would love to try it on draft or get to a definitely fresh or well stored bottle. Even with some slight handling flaws evident this beer is still to be examined multiple times."
"Drinkability: one bottle will be enough in one sitting. Pretty high abv reduces drinkability, but that's just the style. Good beer, I think I enjoyed it more than Abt 12."
"D - without question, i'd drink this again."
"Not bad, not a westy 8 but not bad."
"I am not a Belgian connoisseur by any means and I really enjoy this one. I understand why this beer is rated so high: refined, delicate, and bold at the same time. Worth the $5 and will certainly drink more in the future."
"This one fell a little below my expectations given the praise for Rochefort in general. Definitely good, but I can't put my finger on why I didn't give it a little better rate."
"D: A fantastically well-made beer, with lots of great balance and flavor. However, I've had comparably complex beers -- especially barrel-aged ones -- that felt smoother, particularly with regard to alcohol masking. I appreciate how well-made this is, but I don't regard it as one of the best I've had."
"Delicious, unique. Easily the hoppiest of the three Rocheforts."
"D - goes down smooth and easy."
"Thoroughly impressed, will buy this beer again."
"D: An execellent strong Belgian speciman... Enjoy often."
"Overall- This is a pretty good beer. Though I am not sure I will be picking it up again for the price."
"It is growing on me, though...."
"The best Belgian beer I've had to-date."
"Overall, this is a solid beer. Very expensive, but worth it to try it once. I would definitely have another had I had the wallet. Highly recommended."
"update review on flavor on 6/23/2010: This is somewhat sour and vinegary. There are some sugary and caramely malts and some very faint dark fruits on top of this. Not nearly as complex as the flavors mentioned above."
"D: Not one I would throw in the cooler for the tailgate. Its so far above that its rediculous! This is one to really be appreciated. This is an excellent beer! One of the best I've ever had"
"If they had this on tap anywhere near here, I'd probably lose my job. Nice job, Rochefort Trappistes..."
"Brew poured to a deep brown color with a big medium tan colored head that broke down quite quickly, no lacing. A lot of yeast floaties in the glass. The aroma is nice and extremely dynamic, strong malt aroma with a great mix of fruit, cherries and figs. Also has a musty brandy scent that goes along with things very well. The flavor is absolutely incredible, I thought that the flavor was dynamic, the flavor takes it to a different level. Picking up the malts, they give a chocolate like flavor that was not noticeable in the nose, cherry is there as well with an ever so slight coffee flavor. What is probably a little crazy is it somewhat reminds me of a root-beer float with the end flavors and carbonation. Extremely drinkable, the alcohol does not come through one bit as it is hidden in the complexity of this brew. Oh so good!!!"
"Wish this beer was cheaper here... I'd be drinking it all the time."
"Overall: I honestly think I got a bad bottle of beer. It don't taste like beer and sure is not a strong Belgium beer. It don't taste even close to a Chimay Grand Reserve. I am going to see if I can find another bottle of beer. I will be reviewing this. I am dumping this down the drain."
"D - A rich beer. The ABV is masked very well. Dangerously drinkable."
"Very different but nice. Complex. Like word association for your tongue. This is supposed to be the example for the style and if it is, then lets try some more."
"MF&D - the feel is great except I find it to be a bit too thin. a bit more viscosity would serve her well in my opinion. either way I could drink this all night if I had the option to do so, especially if I were fasting for lent!"
"Belgiums are not my favorite style and I could only do one of these but from an abstract review this is a very good beer if you like the typical belgium strong ales."
"Nice and soft beer which certainly seduced me."
"Overall: A solid beer that I could see why it's so sought after. Not my favorite Belgium style. But I think I'll work on this style more."
"Taste: The taste is alot like the smell. To me this has a definite raw bread dough quality. Kinda sour, fairly sweet. Lots of figs and overripe fruits like lemon."
"The 10, 6 and 8 are very good brews. The 8 is one of my top rated active bottled beers for the Belgian Strong style."
"Pours a very dark brown colored body with a big tan head. Has an aroma of malts, hops, perfume, dark fruit, and some alcohol. A taste of dark fruits, perfume, strong alcohol, but a smooth aftertaste. Stronger alcohol than the 10."
"Poured deep hazed brown with a fantastic head, quite rocky. Some dark raisin and prunes are noted in the aroma with some band-aid, and subtle spice. Flavor is sweet, phenolic - good but not great or world class. Mouthfeel provides a pleasant experience as expected from this Belgian style with a par drinkability. I would assume that locally fresh this would be a bit better."
"I'm not convinced that this bottle wasn't kept very well or something, because it just seems a bit off to me. Reading other reviews, however, I see that others have given similar sentiments, so I'm just not sure. I'm going to pick up another bottle next week from another retailer and revisit this review as necessary."
"Drinkability: Good, but pales in comparison to the (10) and others of this style; a little on the thin side"
"Great stuff."
"A muddy brown color pour with lively carbonation and a two finger offwhite head.Aroma of wine grapes,cherries apples and oaky vanilla.Flavor is dry and fruity at the start,as it warms you get more of the sweet side of the malt,some brown sugar and a touch of peppery spice.A crisp mouthfeel. Very good !"
"12oz bottle, nice turbid and cloudy brown color with a puffy head,. Smells malty, some spice but not much. The taste is unlike almost any other beer I have had, so strange. Gummy, spicy, malts, Dr. Pepper. Quite different but I'm not sure its my thing. The alcohol is well hidden which makes it quite easy to make it through the glass."
"If you were to plunk down a glass of TR8 and tell me to have a guess at what the alcohol content is, I would never in a million years suspect this of being 9.2%. Never. This is one of the most deceptive beers I've ever had. The price and the abv keep this sucker from being anything remotely sessionable, but I'll return for one again sometime down the road."
"Man oh man is this stuff great. There's obvious complexity that dares you to decipher it, but you know you're better of just sitting back and enjoying the ride."
"Had this beer hyped up before I drank it, so I was expecting the world. Didn't quite get the world, per se, but it's sure as hell a fair sight better than a stick in the eye. Rich brown color with a light tan head. Aroma is sweet with overripe dark fruit and molasses. Flavor is that of figs, allspice, and a hint of what might be juniper soaked in dark, sweet wine (really, that's what I came up with). A wonderful beverage, but I didn't fall out of my seat."
"Overall, First beer of the night and I'm already feeling the warmth. The alcohol flavors are strong but this beer brought back memories of drinking Jim Beam with a friend a few years ago."
"A must try for any Belgian beer lover. Simply divine."
"I am not as impressed with this as much as the Rochefort 10 though that is expected. When I think of similar beers the Westvleteren 8 definitely tops this. I am going to revisit the 6 sometime soon as well, it's been too long. When it comes down to it, even though this is good, I am always just going to go with the 10."
"It's a great beer and is definitely on my personal top 5."
"10/5/9/5/20 (4.9/5)"
"(rated Feb 6, 2007)"
"Overall I'm glad I revisited this beer, and as I'm drinking the 10 I think I prefer the 8. It's a bit lighter with what I think is better balance. Give this one a try if you haven't already."
"O-I really wanted to enjoy this beer but the overcarbonated feel made hard to taste and not so enjoyable an experience, Underlying flavors are complex but hard to taste for a while. I bet this is fantastic with at least 2 years of age on it."
"Overall, very disappointing. I hope it's better the next time I try it."
"This is a solid beer, no doubt, but IMO there is no comparison between it and it's bigger brother, the Rochefort 10. So while this is a nice enough beer, for an extra buck or two, I'll always go with the 10 if it's available."
"Overall: Doesn't taste much like the other Belgian Strong Dark Ales: much stronger yeast, almost yogurt-y flavor more reminiscent of a Belgian Strong Pale Ale or Tripel. This is not quite what I was expecting seeing that it is sometimes compared with a Chimay Bleue or Trois Pistoles. It is a little too thin without any of the sweetness that usually accompanies a dark ale. I feel like this would improve with age; it's a little too tart right now."
"11.2 oz bottle. Cloudy brown pour into a Chimay chalice with a fantastic frothy large tan head. Great even lacing with yeast particles suspended in the glass. Aroma of plums, yeast and raisins. Full taste with caramel, yeast, malt, and dark fruit present. Nice even but full finish."
"D_This one is a sipper. The taste isn't very prohibitive but the ABV and the slight medicinal taste is. I don't think I would go for another soon. I will buy it again eventually though"
"D: As with their other beers very good drinkability and a rare treat if you find it. A rich lustrious desert drink."
"Served in a Chimay glass, actually I thought I had a Rochefort glass, but I couldn't find it. Consume date is 2013, I have to buy another bottle to to age, it sure will get better. Dense and creamy brown head that to my surprise faded too soon, with a lot of floaties. Hazy brown colour. Aroma: cocoa, figs, raisins, barrel aged wine, plums, vanilla. Mouthfeel is just warmness, like a brandy. Taste:complex, its different with every sip, figs, apricots, cocoa, vanilla. Hard to say everything that goes on in this beer."
"Yum. Pours brown with some floaties and an awesome thick off-white head. Aroma is stacked with malts, fruits, and some alcohol. Creamy mouthfeel. Taste is mostly darker fruits, malts, and some earthiness, but everything is subdued and in balance. Sweet and warm."
"ehhh... Underwhelmed. I loved the 10 - and with this having better reviews, I think it's ultimately one I'll have to revisit."
"Pours a dark chocolate brown color with a thin beige, foamy head. Roasted malty aroma with hints of chocolate, toffee and dark fruit. Flavor once again dominated by roasted maltiness, chocolate, toast, caramel, toffee raisin, dark cherries and fig. Extremely quaffable, excellent beer."
"D: Complex and worth the money. Might be slightly overrated."
"This was a good quality beer, but the alcohol was a little too dominant for my liking in a beer."
"Mouthfeel is rich. The alcohol presence is mild and the result is a nice, smooth slow sipper. Drinkability is good for this level abv. A nice winter treat. Something to savor."
"Overall: I would probably order or purshase this beer if I was in the mood for it, but other then that...nothing too crazy. A good beer that should be enjoyed at least once by every BA. A try it beer."
"This was my inaugural pour for my new Chimay goblet, not exactly the fanciest of goblets but my first. I will admit that the beer looked much better than Belgians usually do in my tulip glass. This is somewhat off-topic, but I wasn't a believer in glassware until now. At any rate, this beer pours a beautifully dusky brown with a calm head. It's a nearly idyllic looking in the goblet. The beer looks substantive and earthy, like something that would be drunk at great feasts. The nose is wonderfully Belgian. There is some alcohol presence, which mostly serves the complex smells of fruits and malt. The taste is a highly refined caramel with an array of bitter and sweet fruits. It's a wonderful beer that deserves its reputation. It's certainly a heavyweight even in a style this competitive. The feel is lush and velvety, and I could chew on this beer all night."
"this is a bottle i got in a bif, this one is aged about three years, poured into my duvel tulip glass, poured out loking like the brown watter in a mud puddle, this had a head that wouldent quit rise and linger for awhile, the sent that hits my nose is sour and full bodied with hints of strong grain, the taste is a sweet and sour exploshian of malt and a smooth rush of alchoal at the end, this is malty from start to finish and qoes down quickley, after i drank this i was buzzed and wanted more to bad i only had the one thanks coldmeat23"
"Pours a hazy deep amber to a brown-ish color, with a off white head. In the aroma, dark fruit, mostly fig, touch of sugar and alcohol. In the taste, darkk fruit, fig, sugary, licorice, and a small alcohol heat behind the whole thing. A smooth and medium to big mouthfeel, with a semi dry sugary, dark fruit in the aftertaste. Quite complex, dark fruit and alcohol, yet not huge. Smooth and fantastic."
"pours a very dark amber color, has a very slight ruby color to it, and a big head that dissipates quickly without much lacing, taste is strong, the alcohol content really slaps you at first, but after a couple sips it starts to become more tolerable. taste is just great, a warm spiciness to it, and a wonderful malt flavor as well. mouthfeel is full and rich, really awesome. a very very good beer."
"D - Degré d'alcool parfaitement dosé, excellent bière bien équilibrée, recommande certainement"
"D - very high drinkablity, the earthyness balances the sweetness"
"D - This is a nice one. Not too sweet, just boozy enough and complex. A keeper for the night."
"I take this as a good omen for my Belgian to be a great one as well!"
"D: not one of the best trappist ales i've ever had, somewhat disappointing actually. a little much on the carbonation for me. and the alcohol is not hidden very well either."
"D= This bottle had a bit of age on it, but not anywhere near its outer limit. Very drinkable but not without its faults. Still, this is a great tasting beer, I just wish it had a better aroma profile."
"Oh! I just discovered the perfect combination! Rochefort 8 and brie! I put thin slices of this remarkable French cheese on ""Party Extras"" crackers (Haust) and it's pure bliss combined with this great beer. I was initially surprised with the enthousiasm that the head formed. Pouring very carefully a thick layer (5 cm) of beige froth formed on top of the dark brown liquid. Then I rummaged around in my fridge to look for something to accompany it... and found it! The wonderful sweet taste of the beer combines excellent with the sweet taste of the brie. Highly recommended!"
"This beer is quite easy to drink and can be enjoyed by a wide variety of beer lovers."
"Nice Belgian dark ale. I personally like the 6 & 10 more, but this is mighty tasty. Can't go wrong with any from the Rochefort line up."
"D - It a bit pricey but very worth having a few in your cooler. This is a ver easy drinking brew. I will defiately be looking for more to age."
"D - Very enjoyable and easy to drink. It gets better as it warms up."
"D: Amazingly drinkable. This ABV and profile wouldn't be my choice for a session beer of course but I would certainly revisit this brew and I am looking forward to trying more Belgium Ale."
"This and the 10 are the best beers I've ever had. 5 all-around for this one. Gorgeous looking beer with a creamy head with exceptional retention. Smells fruity and sweet, but not too sweet. The taste is like heaven in a bottle. Tastes like silk. The malty and velvety feel and accompanied by some slight coffee undertones with the alcohol reminding us how great the beer is. The blend is unbelievable. Well, this is one of the best beers I've ever had. Everyone needs to try it!"
"This is one of the best beers I've ever had. It pours beautifully, has a wonderfully rich aroma. The taste is slightly less sweet than some of the other trappist belgians, which is perfect for me. I like this better than Chimay. I enjoys this out of a frosty tulip glass, but a goblet would've worked just as well. Try one!"
"The beer pours a deep mahogany with a reddish hue and quickly diminishing light tan head. The aroma is quite fruity, a bit spicy, and fairly sweet, rather inviting. The flavor is quite complex, very malty, dark fruits, and a bit earthy. The beer finishes a just a bit tart, slightly dry, and with a prick of the medium-high carbonation. The flavors linger nicely on the palate with just a bit of warm glow in my belly. Overall a very flavorful beer, yet still quite drinkable at the ABV, even better as it warms."
"Wonderful beer will drink it agin if given the option."
"Give it a shot.."
"A tasty Belgian treat. Flavor is mellow overall with pleasant subtleties. Fruity and musty. A winner."
"I used to love Rochefort 8; I still do, but I used to too. Fresh and aged, I've had delectable experiences with whole crew, numbers 6 through 10. This is a great place to start for anyone beginning to discover Belgian beers and is a frequent revisit for all connoisseurs. World class."
"A very smooth beer that goes down very easily and hides the alcohol well. Carbonation is moderate and if this was not so expensive it would be on my weekly list."
"its best for game meat. or a great steak... well seasoned. but it works for fish too. had it with leg of lamb over potatoes and greens and some pickled white anchovies."
"D- This is an awesome beer that took me a few sips to warm up to. At first I didn't know what to think about this beer but it very quickly grew on me. It is a nice, well put together Belgian that is complex and very smooth. I'm sure the aging process has helped a lot with the mouthfeel and maybe has hindered the nose. After some aging it's still a bit boozy and it would be hard to drink more than this bottle. One I will have again (if found at a decent price)."
"Quality overall brew, far exceeded my expectations (I realize it gets a 4.31 but its also a BSDA). I'd definitely have another, especially as it keeps getting better as it warms up. Very well crafted, still not my favorite flavors ever but performs like a great beer should, hard to knock it."
"Drinkability: An enjoyable sipping beer, I wasn't expecting a thrist-quencher, though."
"D: I love this beer! It's what beer should be. Old world style that takes you back to old Europe. If you can, drink this in a thick old fashioned wooden or ceramic beer stein."
"D. Served cold, but much more enjoyable close to room temperature (duh). Not my style, but definite quality."
"An awesome beer. I wish the bottle would have never ended. A treat and a must try by any means."
"Drinkability: If not for the high alcohol content (and high price) would be a great session beer. Very drinkable and very tasty."
"Not one to overdo, and may claim the palette for a while. Plan to finish with this one."
"Pours a slightly murky deep brown in color with amber hints at the edges and about a finger of dense, moussy and persistent light tan head. Aroma is complex and intriguing without being overpowering. Lots of sweet malt, some caramel, some alcohol and lots of esters. Dark cherries, figs, plums and raisins all seem to be present here. The taste is much like the aroma. Lots of sweet malt, some wonderful caramel notes and more fruity esters. The malt dominates at first but then gives way to the dark fruit esters. Just before the finish the esters are replaced by some sweetness and a pleasant alcohol. Mouthfeel is good, well attenuated, medium-light body with moderate carbonation and a nice smooth alcohol warmth. Drinkability is quite good, this beer is complex and interesting yet still accessible."
"D. This is a rare treat. Wouldn't drink it all the time, but good to end a session with. Next time I plan to share a bomber with a friend."
"Overall: very nicely done"
"However, after about the third taste, I couldn't help but taking decent sized mouthfuls to just enjoy the fullness of the beer."
"Drinkability - pretty high, it's very smooth and tastes really good, simply. The only thing that would stop you from drinking a lot of these is it's abv and hefty pricetag. A great beer. Of course it is, It's a Trappist beer."
"Notes: I had read about this beer and considered calling a distributor to see about ordering it. I was delighted to see that it is for sale at the Bier Markt. I learned about the Bier Markt here at BA. Thanks to all of you for that type of information. Addendum: Since writing this I found Rochefort at World Wines and Liquor in Mentor for $4.99 a bottle. It was more than that at Bier Markt."
"An all around awesome beer, highly recommended."
"D: Easier to drink than one might think but not as easy as some other belgian dark ales. I think its the CO2 and alcohol; this one will sneak up on you."
"Drinkability: Nothing wrong here. Not quite on par with the Rochefort 10 as far as Rochefort brews go, but then again, it's a completely different style, so what're you gonna do. Probably the best Belgian Strong Dark I've had - lots of great complexities in this one, and although there's plenty of EtOH, it's well hidden. Recommended, and fortunately easy to find."
"D - A little strong, but balanced so well that it is very dangerous and deceptive."
"Pours a dark brown cola color with a big light brown head. Smells mildly of cherry and cola. Tastes mildly of cola, cherry, and brown sugar, and wee bit of sourness in there at the finish. A pleasant flavor, just kind of watered-down overall. A solid beer, but the pinch of sourness in there knocked it down a notch for me."
"The beer poured a murky brownish, reminded me of cola, with a pretty thick off white head, in which a thin film was maintained throughout the beer. The aroma was a little weak, the yeast was prevelent in that it had a slight fruity aroma, but I didn't think it was all that great. The taste was very good. I thought that it had a malty cola taste to it. The cola flavor made it a bit too sweet for my taste for a Belgian Strong Dark Ale, still very interesting. The beer had good carbonation and was smooth and easy to drink. Overall, a solid beer."
"3/4/2008. Pours a murky brown color topped with a thick foamy head. The head does taper off a bit, leaving a thin head the rest of the way. Still leaves a good amount of lacing. Fruity, faint spiced malt aroma with a touch of yeast. Extremely smooth flavor with a rush of sugary dark fruits, slightly spicy with malts taking a back seat. Maybe even some caramel somewhere in there. A long, tasty, gentle mouthfeel. 9.2% and I hardly know it's there. This is one of the best beers I have had to date."
"I found it to be very drinkable such as settling in for an afternoon of football sitting back in a comfortable chair, perhaps with your computer in front of you as you watch the games. What could be sweeter than great football and a really good solid beer that after a couple you know you've been drinking beer."
"Drink ability= I like this beer, but the alcohol content would cause to either keep it to one a night, or drink it only at home."
"D - I'm not really as impressed as the hype had been built up for it. I will have to try another and edit my review in case this was a bad bottle. With all of the good reviews and how little I'm givig this it has to be a bad bottle."
"D- Very easty to drink, very solid brew"
"Overall a great brew! Taste is very similar to Westy, wonder why that is :)"
"Picked up this bottle at Kingdom Liquors in Brandon FLA. Deepak had a few bottles stashed in the back room for anyone who asked for this. Pours a cloudy brown with a white head. Aroma is full of brown sugar and dark fruits. A bit of dark fruit and sugar rings through on the flavor. ABV is hideen well."
"D - A great Belgian trappist ale, superb quality and flavor w/ a deep fruit and complex malt that makes the 9.2% seem like half that. I would savor this repeatedly - Outstanding drinkability"
"Ruby brown with caramel and orange hues, this beer sure didn't feel like a strong ale as it's considered. It was mellow and medium bodied with no cloying flavors. Flavor-wise was mostly of figs, and throw in some bits of dark fruit, brown sugar, and oak. Alcohol was disguised well. It was more straight-forward than I was expecting, but still a nice treat to clean up a filet mignon dinner."
"Complex and very tasty beer."
"Two fingers of tan froth sit patiently atop a dark brown brew, lingering for a for quite a while until dissipating and leaving a nice ring of lace all around the glass. Smells is very complex with some chocolate, caramel, yeast, sweet bread and licorice hitting the nose. Taste compliments the complexity of the aromas with fudge, caramel, molasses, dark chocolates, dark fruits and spice all being equally presented. The alcohol heat is present, and invigorating. Mouth-feel is medium to full-bodied, which leads to a great sipper. It's not overly carbonated, but a bit restless nonetheless. Took me a while to get around to this famous brew, and it was much what I expected, which is a good thing."
"Very fresh bottle. Opaque dark brown with a one finger head that dissipates quickly to leave a thin foam cap. Big sediment, even with a careful pour. Smells of roasted malt, brown sugar, and dried dates and bananas. Full, toasty taste with loads of sugar and some dark, overripe fruit notes. Slight astringency with a warming finish. Quite complex. Mouthfeel is thick and creamy, like it should be, though the carbonation is slightly higher than one would hope."
"Very carbonated mouthfeel stings the tongue a little, but in a good way. So smooth and drinkable, I could have this all night. Definitely going to get more of this when I can."
"M/D - Medium to full body and medium carbonation. Feels great. Very drinkable as well."
"M&D: Very smooth and pleasing on the palate. A little warming. Extremely drinkable."
"Belgian styled beers are hit or miss for me, so take my review with a grain of salt. This is obviously a beer that many people love with good reason. I recommend you try it and will probably try it again myself too see if I have a different opinion the second time around."
"overall this is smoother than Trappistes Rochefort 10."
"The drink is warm and smooth with great feel and drinkability, and the actual drinking of it a bit reminiscent of enjoying a fine brandy. I really liked Trappistes Rochefort 6, I hereby declare that I 'love' T. R. 8, and now I can't wait to try 10!!"
"Sweet friuty smelling beer with a wonderful dark appearance and a thin off white creamy head.The taste...WOW! It`s malty & cakey and full of dried fruits with a spiced chocolatey aftertase.I feel almost honered to be drinking this,it`s special and delicious."
"Not bad."
"Pours brown in color with ruby highlights. The most impressive thing is the frothy half inch head that is still there several minutes after the pour. This beer looks good! Very carbonated and creamy feel. Taste has a certain spice going on. Not as much dark fruit as the 10, but still noticeable. Very good beer that I could drink regularly. This is far from a knock, but I prefer the 10."
"Serving: from bottle into a tulip glass"
"Drinkability: High."
"The beer pours a murky brown with a frothy off white head that refuses to yield, leaving lace down the side of the glass. The smell is full of caramel and prunes. The taste echoes the smell with a bit of burnt chocolate in there as well. The body is medium with lively carbonation. Overall, a pretty good BSDA. I think that the depth achieved by the 10 is unmatched however."
"At the risk of overstating the case (and despite the fact that it's well within the monks' wishes for proper consumption) this bottle of Trappistes Rochefort 8 has seen better days. It's definitely good beer, but I was expecting great beer. I hereby resolve to purchase a fresher sample and give it another review."
"M: As I said, comes away cleanly. Very smooth, and (To steal someone else's description) silky. Maybe even a bit more than the 10"
"Drinkability: I gotta say, I really like this beer. The more belgians I have, the more I find that I like. Well done monks!"
"All in all, a very tasty beer. Not as complex as the 10, but a great beer nonetheless."
"particular offering stands out head & shoulders above my recent samplings. I'm getting more & I'm gonna cellar some."
"D: A very complex beer. One to sip and take in all it has to offer."
"Easy to drink, flavorful and unique. Very complex and a lot of great features. One of the best Belgians I've ever had."
"d: i have had this beer before a couple of times and remember it as being a little bit more fruity but it is still quite good"
"Superb brew."
"Overall, one of the best glasses of beer I've tasted -- one of those beers that leaves you with an overall sense of well-being when you're done, more than can be attributed to the 9% ABV alone. This is my first actual trappist beer, and it has me seriously wondering how people drink something this epiphanic and then go on with their everyday life. I'm not sure I'll be able to bring myself to brush my teeth tonight."
"The bottle opened with a fizz and it sounded like pouring coke. Med-dark brown, hazy, garnet highlights. 1/2 finger head with dense off white bubbles. Intense fruit on the nose. mandarine & lemons, nothing like the caramel bananas I remember from last time. Malt aromas are poking through but it's mandarine all the way for me. Incredibly complex taste, malty, toasty, fruity, melanoidiny with a good boozy kick in the arse. Bitterness is superbly balanced. wow, this beer is an epiphany. This is almost as good as when I first tasted rochy 10 in amsterdam. I didn't think it could be this good. One of my all time greatest beer experiences."
"Poured Coca-Cola brown with about 1 cm of medium tan head. Appears a bit cloudy. Not sure if this is normal for the style. Seems to be unfiltered with quite a bit of sediment at the bottom of the bottle, so no loss of points on appearance for the cloudiness. Not much detectable aroma for me. Maybe a hint of hops? Fairly balanced taste, with maybe a little more malt than hops. A bit of alcohol warming going down. Nice flavor. Hard to find anything I don't like about the flavor of this one. Medium/high carbonation, medium body. VERY drinkable, but with the high ABV I doubt I could drink many of them."
"Not the easiest, but definitely better than average."
"complexities that I've come to know and love from Rochefort. As noted from another review, the yeast spice and the alcohol doesn't really work for me."
"Of the 3 Rochefort's this is by far the most interesting. This is certainly a beer that's worth trying. The cost is way too high and ultimately it isn't something I'll buy again."
"This is great stuff, but the alcohol is a bit annoying."
"Not one of my favorites, but I admire how well-made this is."
"All in all, I could use a slightly more full body for a beer of this potency, but it is still quite smooth and relatively easy drinking. This isn't quite a sipper, but don't guzzle it either. A delightful brew!"
"D - I wouldn't ever have more than one at a time. It's not all that intense; it's decent enough, but something about this brew is unbalanced. I much prefer Rochefort 10."
"Overall impressions: I was really looking forward to this beer, but after having a Unibroue Maudite, it just doesn't quite stack up. Don't get me wrong this is a GREAT beer, but if we're rating it and comparing it to others in the same style, Maudite is the clear winner."
"So...again, I don't think the sediment was indicative of the style (I've had American-made Belgian dubbles, tripels and others before), and I definitely plan to get another fresher bottle as soon as possible. But that said, I'm quite impressed regardless. And it went amazingly well with the tender roast beef au jus I had for lunch. I imagine it would go down well with just about any decadent meal."
"D: A good sipper, alcohol is well hidden so as not to cloud the overall flavor of this beer. One is all that I would want to have because this beer is as rich as any I've ever tried."
"I got equally as excited when I tasted this beer as I did the first time I tasted it two years ago. This is truly one of the best beers in the world. Now if I could just find some more 10..."
"I prefer this to Rochefort 10. The alcohol is little more subtle but it is still high and limits drinkability. Very expensive and hard to find in my area as well."
"Can't go wrong with this one, but I wasn't blown away like I was the 10."
"Pours dark brown with a thick, lasting one finger head. Aroma of toffe, chocolate, dark fruits, and yeast. Extremely complex beer with notes of vanilla, toffee, and chocolate. Has a strong vineous quality. This beer has a lot going one. Very smooth finish. Exceptional beer."
"hmm... will have to secure a different batch for comparison. will do so ASAP."
"A true revelation for me I will be coming back to this one again and again."
"M/D - A little on the thin side but a full flaovred very dinkable brew."
"D: Overall, not as strong of a taste as I would have though, but enjoyable nonetheless. 9.2% is gonna make this less drinkable but it goes down easy enough."
"Poured into a Rochefort goblet (damn sexy glass) drank over the course of 20 minutes so it warmed from fridge temp to perfection. Complex flavor through out. If there was ever a reason to become a monk this would be it. I am a Beer Advocate and I advocate this beer with 2 hearty thumbs up!"
"Glad I was able to try it."
"Drinkability: Smooth beyond belief, complex and changing as you drink it, well worth the ~$5 a 330ml bottle."
"Notes: I do not buy into hype,but this is another example of why Belgium is so unique in the beer world. The brew is memorable in every sense of the word. Expensive,but worth it."
"Definitely a ""wow"" beer. This is another reason why Belgium is the Disneyland of beer. THe number 8 shows us how complex beer can be. I would definitely like to enjoy another, however $5.50 for one beer is a bit steep for me. I will have to pick it up again some other time however. I would say this is a definite ""must-have"" for any beer lover."
"D- It is for sure a Belgian style brew."
"D- The alcohol level is high and noticeable, but it was not harsh in any manner. This is a very interesting beer and well worth a purchase. I am really impressed, but not completely blown away."
"I tried this beer on December 28, 2007 at ""Smokeless Joe's"" in Toronto. The beer poured a dark brown with a huge generous brown head that lasted and lasted. The aroma was very yeasty with some dark fruits and spices. The mouthfeel was full bodied with some mild carbonation. The flavour was very malty followed by some yeasty tones. A very good beer, but not as good as the '10'"
"D = Very nice. I like other Belgians a bit more, but this was very enjoyable. Great for when you're hankering for a quality, malty beer."
"Rochefort 8 is damn good beer. It's not quite as good as 10, but it's far from a slouch. The acidic taste is just a tad too much for my taste. It's not bad or offensive, but it could be toned down a little. All in all, this a fine beer. Certainly one to seek out."
"Every sip is a little different than the lsat. I suppose the complexity is what makes these beers so great."
"Deep mahogony in color with a medium-thick head of medium-sized off-white bubbles. There were aromas of raisins, chocolate, orange pulp, plum and dark caramel. There is a lot of carbonation in the mouth keeping this very light and fresh. The flavors remain on the ""dark side", similar to the nose but lack a bit of concentration. I love the 10, but this just feels like a watered down version, which should be expected but leaves me wanting more."
"without having the luxury of experiencing the Wesvleterens, this is the top of my list for Belgian strong darks!...so far."
"Appearance is a reddish brown with an off white thick head that leaves a sheet of lace. Smell of milk chocolate, prunes and spice. Taste has dark molasses and fruits, spice, brown sugar. Mouthfeel is a smooth creamy medium with a good hit of carbonation, nice combo. A very good complex brew that I could just sit with and enjoy."
"Poured into a Rochefort chalice. The color was mahogany brown, and there was a decent sized but thin head. Carbonation was certainly noticeable in the head. The smell was amazing, full of fig and sugar aromas. The taste was just as good, with notes of maple, cinnamon, orange, and pears present. A nice combination of sweetness and fruitiness. This beer was a bit thinner in the body than I would have expected, which is the only negative I could possibly mention. This is easily one of the best Trappist beers available in the US market."
"D: A good combination of mouthfeel and taste makes this beer pretty drinkable. You do not taste the alcohol level at all and it goes down pretty easy. I think it could have been a little better had it had slightly less carbonation."
"Overall a great beer. Dont be surprised by the small size it packs a kick at 9.2% alcohol."
"Drinkability: This is a very good beer, I won't lie to you."
"D - Drinkability is good. The abv is high but that does not have any affect on how easy it goes down. Recommemded for any Belgian fan."
"Pours dark brown, with a light tan and creamy head. Tan sediment is present in my glass. Aromas of roasted malts, sweet fruits and Belgian yeast fill your nose. Malt flavor is sweet, bready and nutty. Fruity notes are of plum, golden raisin and fig. The alcohol is well hidden, but still noticeable. Well balanced with a medium body, nice carbonation and a smooth mouth feel. Exceptional Trappist ale."
"Medium carbonation, very balanced and complex. The high abv makes this a slow sipper but very enjoyable. I like how this beer really changes as it warms."
"Awesome drinkablity I sipped away at this for about a half hour and enjoyed every drop. I will gladly grab a few more of these"
"Overall, another of Rochefort's fantastic beers. Someday I'm gonna have the 6, 8 and 10 side-by-side!"
"Pours a murky dark brown color with some red and amber hues in the light. 1/2 inch of cream colored thick fizzy head lasts for about a minute leaving some nice lacing. Smells of sweet brown sugar, nuts, molasses, cinnamon, and dark fruits. Taste is very similar, sweet maple sugar, clove, cherries, nuts, chocolate, and a touch of hops before a warm alcohol finish. Hints of butter and apples as the beer warms. Medium in body with a high carbonated feel, smooth but with a tingle to it. A nice balance with lots of flavors going on an some alcohol presence reminding you to take it slow, this baby is over 9%abv after all. Easy to drink but with the higher alcohol you may not want to drink more than 1 a night, very rewarding and something I'd save for a special occasion."
"This poured a dark hazy brown with fluffy light tan head. Its scent was a nice blend of malt and hops. It tasted of lots of citrus hops and some malt, and had an average aftertaste. It was watery and somewhat soapy with standard carbonation. Overall this wasn't necessarily bad, but it was certainly not an impressive beer."
"D: Best I've had in this category. Will be back."
"The pour was a deep dark brown with a two finger tan head that falls apart after a few seconds. Right off the bat you could smell the alcohol flavor. Along with that there is definitely roasted malts, caramel, and chocolate. The taste was the same but the alcohol definitely adds a huge bite. It is a full bodied beer with an alcoholic bite. This beer is for slow drinking and pure enjoyment."
"Certainly a very good beer, but there are lots more out there that I want to try."
"A marvelous dark Begian strong ale, full of the wonderful complexity exempletive of the best of this style. Highly recommend."
"D: Very, very drinkable. Wonderful trappist brew! The high ABV is nicely balanced by the complex taste."
"Pours a dark brown with ruby hues. A large luxurious light tan head sits on top with good retention receeding to leave some lace on the glass and a clumpy mass later on. Aroma is slightly sour. A slight vengar aroma with some smokiness. Strong malty profile. Dark fruits, chocolate, and a little bit of alcohol. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, silky, and lightly carbonated. Drinkability is fair. Easy to drink, but strong flavors and high alcohol limit the amount of consumption."
"A great Trappist to enjoy late in the evening while you unwind from a long day."
"The taste was bitter to start and finished with sweet peaches. I also got some bananas. I found it very well balanced. The sensors in my mouth were left buzzing for some time. Very, very enjoyable beer to have a couple times a year."
" I could drink 2 or 3 of these at a sitting, so I would have to say drinkability: high. If you drink 6+ beers at a time, probably wouldn't want to go with this one. might get overwhelmingly sweet, not to mention the cost. good beer, and I will definitely try the rest of their offerings."
"Cloudy, dense deep brown color that maintains a strong, white head that stays for a while and leaves a little lacing after about an hour or so. Smells like dried fruit and alcohol, but not in a bad way - we're talking high quality cognac or rum. Taste is kind of disappointing. Smooth, but there is nothing really catching my attention. Regardless, the taste is good. Mouthfeel is incredibly smooth and well done. This is a high quality beer that is very easy to drink due to its smoothness. Highly recommended."
"Appearance very dark brown two finger tan head that didn't last as long as I thought it would. Smell some rosted character as well as dark fruits. Taste complex fruity some fig a bit of sweetness in the begining with a dry roasted character in the finish. Mouthfeel mediem body with high carbonation. Drinkability a nice afterdinner beer maby with a good movie and cheese and crackers for a snack."
"Pours murky dark reddish brown, with big, quick disappearing head. Sweet aroma of malt, fresh bread, some fruit. Full bodied, big maltiness with hints of sweet fruit -- figs? Sweet, bready malt character takes center stage. Finish is all malt, bready, sweet. Palate is big and sticky. Delicious beer."
"Notes: For my second test of a Belgian ale and first for a Belgian Strong Dark Ale, this was one hell of a place to start with. Extremely impressed with the brew. Not as malty as I expected, however, it does obviously have a malt backbone. Definitely would recommend this to anyone who has the chance to grab one."
"D: Whew, it's been far too long since I've enjoyed one of these - perhaps since Belgium, some 18 months ago... we both agreed this is a phenomenal beer, way too easy to drink. One we'll be sure to have more often; now with 2 in reserve - recent New Seasons pick-ups at a reduced/liquidation(!) price - it's sure to happen sooner."
"Prosit, MK"
"pours a cloudy brown with a very large tan head with a easy pour that holds to a quarter inch but not much lacing on the glass. sweet fruity nose with some caramel and spice also. taste is complex and the alcohol is strong but goes down very smoothly. medium body with a excellent carbonation. price was a little prohibitive at 6.95 for a 11.2 oz bottle otherwise its just great."
"I have to say, it isn't what I expected. You might think it'll be a big, dark, alcoholic monster of a beer, but it's really pretty easy going thanks, in part, to its fantastic balance. There are a lot of subtleties and changing flavors with this Trappist ale. Complex fruitiness and a sort of sweet bread quality throughout...very nice."
"D: Holy water - this beer is incredible. So many complex flavours so well balanced. It packs a punch but you would never know it as it is so easy to drink - could potentially be dangerous ;-). If you see this beer, buy it! it really is something special."
"Wonderful ruby brown trappist beer. The beige head is a little thin but with good lacing. The aroma is a symphony of dried fruit, banana and spices. A flavour of plum caramel and a hint of chocolate. Medium o full bodied. Fine balance between sweet malt and alcohol. Very tasty."
"11.2 oz bottle. Pours a deep dark brown, nice amount of tan head that retains very well. Smell is very sweet, raisins, spices, toffee, figs, roasted malts. Taste is much the same but with a really nice layer of dark fruit, apples, raisins, and maybe just a hint of citrus. Some very distant dry bitterness toward the finish. I can detect the alcohol, but it's very well hidden considering the abv. Mouthefeel is somewhat coarse, carbonation is moderate to high. It's a fairly intense beer but wonderfully balanced. If it weren't for the high sticker price I'd pick it up pretty often."
"This is a must drink for anyone who is serious about belgians or craft brews in general. There are only a couple others in this style that I would put on it's level. Great flavors, compexity, and drinkability"
"The flavor is not quite as complex as R-10, but still superior to most other belgians. The palate is greeted by musky, dark fruits, sweet toffee-caramel malts, and a slight nutty, chocolate finish. There isn't a hint of alcohol at first, but as the beer warms, a slight warming touch sets in. The body is well-carbonated, medium in thickness, and delivers a semi-dry aftertaste. It's smooth & heavy, but truly a joy to consume. This is definately a winner...I'd quickly cough up the $4.99 per bottle again if my budget would allow it."
"Overall - A remarkable beer, probably better than its Quadrupel brother."
"The bottling code on this one was L050912 08:21, indicating a bottling date of September 2007. The 9.20% ABV beer poured a dark (rootbeer) brown, and even with an easy pour developed a thick foamy beige head. Lots of sticky lacing is left as the head drops. The aroma has notes of banana, clove and yeast. The taste of the Rochefort 8 is malty and complex, with hints of vanilla, milk chocolate and brown sugar. There's a slightly bitter aftertaste though the beer finishes cleanly leaving little behind. The mouthfeel is highly carbonated."
"For a fan of Belgians, it's hard to find any faults with this beer... except that it's not Rochefort 10! Excellent, very refined, a pleas ure to drink."
"Can drink this all day long but it's a lot more mild than I expected - disappointing in that respect but still a well-made and enjoyable, albeit austere, effort."
"Flavor-smoky,meatlike, roasted beechwood, rauchbier, bitter chocolate, molasses, dried figs. This would go so well with grilled foie gras its ridiculous. The mouthfeel is awesome because the flavor lingers forever. Drinkabitlity is limited only by the sheer enjoyment of this beer. 1 puts me in a state of bliss. Can't wait to partake in the 6 and 10."
"First sip is WOW....a hint of chocolate, lots of malt and spice. There is an aftertaste of fruit and molases. Can't put my finger on the fruit..possibly orange or fig....lot's of complex flavors. You can feel the alcohol with the first sip as it warms your cheeks but it is not overpowering. It has a creamy texture as you swish it in your mouth. A great Dark Ale..."
"The mouthfeel is surprisingly fizzy, almost over carbonated. I wonder if aging will relax that. As a final thought, this is very good, but I think I like the 6 and 10 better."
"D - Rochefort...one of the greats! Of course the drinkability is great! I'm sure we'd all drink this more if we could afford it, and for those of you who can, I envy you! If you haven't had this get to it!"
"This is just a smooth beer. The 9.2% just doesn't show itself, unlike the 6 which has a bit more alcohol bite, but this one is definately a bit more warming. Another great beer. Hard to decide between this and the 6 at this point, depends on if I want smooth or a bit more discernable flavor/aroma character."
"The alcohol is hidden like it should be in a Trappist ale. This is very enjoyable."
"Drinkability: Great with a meal, especially red meat. It's a shame it's not available in 750 mL bottles, or in 4-packs. It's fantastic, but not something I could drink every week."
"Purchased from Total Wine and More in Union... this is certainly a world-class, top-notch brew... one of the better Belgians on the market for sure... the overall quality and character of this brew is a step-above most other representations in the category... Great prune-colored, dark-brown, mahogany hue with am impressive frothy head that exhibited nice staying power and lingered for a bit... smell is very intense, with a strong suggestion of roasted malts, candied sugar, and caramel... taste was ultra-rich and thick, sweet, but not cloying, with a strong presence of figs, prunes, dehydrated fruits, malts, caramel, toffee, and a slight vanilla... Mouthfeel was equally rich, filling, and satisfying, with a very easy drinkability that went down smooth, crisp, and clean... An excellent sample... Definitely recommended..."
"Bottled poured a deep brown color with a thick off white head into my Orval glass. Although the head was thick and fluffy, it ran away rather quickly but left behind some nice lacing down the glass and a solid ring that stuck around. The nose of the beer was of dried fruits, biscuity. The taste was pleasant and filling, in a good way. There were dried fruit notes as with the nose, plums. Along with a slightly sweet malt character, the alcohol level is present in the taste and makes for one fine sipping beer. Another very fine Rochefort beer."
"Overall: Another wonderful beer by Rochefort. The taste is very regal, there is no doubt about it, its one of the true masterful beers of the craft beer world. I love those trappist monks more than I can express. They really know their beer."
"D: A sipper with the fullness of the flavor, but the dryness doesn't allow too much time between sips. Flavor is pretty complex but all fits together well. Extremely well crafted beer that would be great any time of the year."
"It's about time i got around to this one;Pours a hazy deep garnet brown, with a exceptionally large tan head and lacing that clings to my glass; Wow smell is unbelievable great sent of hops, and as it warms a bit many complex smells occur, mainly a fruity, almost hot alcohol smell but a pleasing one,a darker fruit and caramelized malt undertone, some hop aroma present as well, a faint bubble-gum too ; a sweet, spicy, crisp taste, not what i'd expected however, i may need to age a bottle a decent belgian malty flavor, i taste a bit of plum/licoriceish in that, but something not as pleasant (cardboardish ?) after the initial taste, a nice aromatic effect tho, i'm not sure how to describe a blend of bread and toasted kiwi ; a dry, surprisingly light body w/ mad dextrins, and awesome co2 ; an extremely drinkable beer, i really wish i had more, although i think this one may be a bit overrated"
"overall, a well-deserved classic, worth trying if you haven't yet."
"Hangs sweetly in the mouth, full and sticky with medium body. Carbonation bubbles on the tongue and fills the mouth (and stomach) with additional froth. Some estery alcohol feel, but hey, it is 9.2%abv. Very very tasty, but fullness of taste and carbonation in combination with abv limit overall drinkability."
"This is a delicious belgian beer. I only hope that I don't get too spoiled as having it as one of my ""everyday"" beers."
"One of the classics for sure ... I've only had the 8 maybe 5 times, and each time, I appreciate it more and more.. very drinkable and something for your friends who don't like ""dark"" beer."
"A creamy, warming brew to sip on (though the smoothness - despite alcohol - makes it easy to more than sip."
"D = This is a great sipping beer. I would highly recommend it. Though it might deaden the taste of the beer somewhat, I think this would be very good with a maduro cigar."
"Like other fine Belgian beers the carbonation produces a surreal creamy consistency that serves to deliver maximum taste. This also creates wonderfully food pairings as the carbonations serves to sweep away each bite of food and reset the taste buds. Drinkability is dangerously high, but I will happily stop at one, but look forward to the next another day."
"Drinkability: A sipping beer, but one that you want to drink."
"Highly drinkable for a more potent type brew, enjoy it slowly for what it's really worth."
"D-One of my favorites for reasons noted above, and for the fact that it's textures are a perfect match for its flavors at every stage. Drinking this beverage inspires a complete appreciation of its masterful chemistry, and makes me feel good."
"poured into a snifter. pours a cloudy mahogany with a slightly tan head that drops rather quickly, but not all the way. Decent lacing. Sweet malty nose that has a sharp prune aroma. The high alcohol is definitely in the nose as well, with a hint of cinnamon. Highly carbonated and a little rough on the first sip. Raisins and prunes are the first thing I get from this, followed by a ton of spices. I also get baked apples and pears from this as well. Feels outstanding to drink this. I love trappist beers."
"This is a wholly drinkable beer. The high ABV never gets in the way and its complexity is excellent."
"It has a slightly bready, moderately heavy mouthfeel to it. I must say I do really appreciate this beer."
"Abbey St. Remy, you have won."
"Full-bodied with mouthfilling carbonation. No criticism in the area whatsoever. Drinks beautifully although the alcohol somewhat limits it beyond a sipping beverage. Anyhow, it's absolutely delightful and a long-overdue treat to myself."
"A delight to drink for sure. I'm starting to feel the alcohol, but it's not very obvious. One of the most drinkable and enjoyable beers in this style."
"Absolutely sublime beer. I am really impressed by the Rochefort line. I can't imagine a belgian being any better, but I haven't tried Westy yet."
"a good sipping beer, but a bit pricy at 5$/12oz"
"This is a wonderful contemplative drink to sip over the course of an evening, and I actually prefer it to the 10."
"Drinkability: This beer is amazing. It is strong, yes, and I was hesitant to give it a 5 for drinkability because of that; but it's such an excellent sipper, so complex and nice, that one bottle should be able to keep you interested for quite a while. And besides that, for 9.2% ABV, the alcohol flavor is very tame. An excellent beer. Extremely versatile with cheese and charcuterie. Respect!"
"Poured from a 330ml bottle into a tulip glass. The beer pours a dark brown, slightly opaque. Leaves a tall head with some lacing that dissipates quickly. Smell is very slight fruit, with the alcohol being evident. The taste isn't as impressive as the 6 or 10, a little spicy, maybe a little malty, but not much more there. Mouthfeel is medium. I wasn't as impressed with this one as the 6 or 10, but it is still a very nice beer..."
"D: A touch strong, but that is only based on personal drinking habits. I would likely do better with the 6 rather than the 8, but I would certainly have this again. A drink to be consumed slowly - though that should allow the drinker to savour it that much more"
"Murky rusty dark brown. Stagnant pond brown. But the light tan head has a nice soft smoothness to it. Faint aroma of yeast, musty, holiday spice. Faint-so faint, but pleasant. The flavor is dry cocoa and dehydrated tree fruit, maybe fig/ date. There is a certain bitter, phenolic/ medicinal grip to it that I find unpleasant, but in my experience that usually indicates that some cellaring is in order. These days I am leaning more towards the milder varieties - like the Rochefort 6, that offer the softened nuances and accessible complexities without the wait for the beer to mature. There is a bitter yeast and boozy flavor on the finish. I have had a better example of this, but it was a few years old. Age-away fellows. At least one year for this."
"Overall: This is a highly complex brew. The taste and aroma have such depth that it takes some time to work everything out. Pretty amazing."
"D= very drinkable depending on your ABV tolerance, and how much your stomach can take before feeling bloated."
"D: I could detect virtually no alcohol presence, what so ever. This is such a smooth and easy drinker. An absolute ""must try""!"
"La Rochefort 8 dissimule à merveille son % élevé d'alcool. Bière hors du commun."
"D- Strong beer for sure but the great flavor and complex notes are incredible. Do not miss this beer."
"This is a wonderful beer."
"This beer is very good."
"Pours extremely dark amber brown with a massive tan head that takes a while to recede and leaves a lot of lacing. Nose is strong and sweet. After a few minutes of it being open and sitting in the glass (and not being drunk), it seems to have calmed down and is a bit more even. Taste is sweet with a huge edge to it. Alcohol is noticeably present, but firmly mixed in with the other flavors. Feel is smooth with character. Highly drinkable."
"Dark brown with beet red highlights when backlit. Half and inch of rocky foam that leaves a modest lacing. Aroma of woody malt, brandy and spices. Taste is very full and complex. You could probably find new things in here every time you drink it. Very smooth, plenty of carbonation. I like drinking it. I will definitely drink more of it."
"Poured this into my Duvel tulip glass. Dark, murky brown with just shy of a two inch fluffy head. Thick lacing. The smell was wonderful. ""Full"" would be the best word for it. Lots of fruits - dark, citrus, and tropical. Very sweet. The taste was delicious and complex, delivering lots of fruits, especially when warmed to room temperature. The carbonation was definitely higher here than in Trappistes Rochefort 10, though not unpleasant by any means. The alcohol is noticeable, but well-hidden compared to the actual ABV. Very warming without doing any damage, especially since you will want to savor every last drop of this as long as you can."
"Mouthfeel takes a hit because it's too carbonated. The 6 and the 8 have this problem, while the 10 seems to have it under better control. The carbonation is distracting, yet fine enough to make the beer go down quite smoothly. Great full body."
"light tan head that shrinks down to a thin film and leaves a nice lace sits on top of a hazy brown beer that has ruby feet. nose is of dark fruit, brown sugar, mollases, caramel (and hop? i know they use hallertau and Styrian Golding, and i could swear i detect a faint hint in the background). taste is way more than the nose suggests. fig, prune, molasses, spicy yeast, bitter hop, rum... on and on... delicious and HUGE. this beer explodes in the mouth. full of carbonation making it feel lighter than it is, medium full body is full of life and finishes dry. great with red meat and earthy, farmy veggies, the boozy taste might be too much for some. the heat is mellower in the older bottles i've had, but nevertheless, this is not for the faint at heart."
"Overall, a fairly decadent and complex dessert beer."
"Poured great into a tulip with a nice head that quickly dissipated into a sea foamy surface with medium residual lacing that was there to stay. Black Cherry/fig aroma mixed with malt and medium alcohol giving this high rating on the nose. Tastes drier than the 6 from start to finish with a more leathery, peaty character. Highly carbonated. I am a little disappointed at this juncture. I feel that there is not enough malty sweetness backing up the rest of the flavor and alcohol notes. I tried one yesterday and thought my buds were off, or I had a bad bottle. This one had the same deficiencies. It's difficult to believe that the 6 is so significantly different to my palate, but that's the way it is."
"Edit: Having now tried Westvleteren 12, this is no longer the best beer I have tasted! Still great, though!"
"Beautiful brunette. Dark brown at that, with a nice big puffy head that subsides to elegant lacing. The smell is of chocolate and/or roasted barley and molasses. The taste is of roasted barley and/or caramelized chocolate malt with maybe something similar to a peat smoked malt. There is definitely some smoky character to this beer. It could just be from the long Belgium boils producing a burnt/caramel taste from the malt. Or more simply just the roasted barley. Whatever the reason this beer has a complex taste. This beer has a medium body with vigorous, but on the softer side, carbonation. Those silly monks did a great job disguising the alcohol content of this beer, however the trade off is the pronounced burnt/smokey/roast, which also makes the beer go down a little slower. Regardless, great beer."
"Heaven in a glass. Tastes of caramel malt, sweet rum, lots of fruits, there is even some chocolate and a spicy finish. This is very smooth and probably the most drinkable high ABV beer I have ever had."
"rochefort 8 pours a slightly hazy amber. a careful pour pays off unless you like em yeasty. A little extra cheese on the taco! The smell is of baked goods and sugary honey. Tastes of dark fruits and almost has an appley quality to it. the mouthfeel is gloriously creamy and smooth. the finish is exceptionally smooth, but i cant help but say there seems to be some st. sixtus influence in the flavor. I mean that in a good way (how else could you) but mostly lovely belgian flavor and that unmistakeable trappist mouthfeel. taste lingers for some time, and the abv is nowhere. great beer."
"Mouthfeel is smooth, with a little carbonation similar to that of drinking a cola. It is not overly heavy on the alcohol character even though the abv is high itself, making this scarily easy to drink. Just wonderful."
"D: I like Belgians, but they're distinctive character and potent flavors limit their repeated drinkability for me. That said, this one is quite refreshing, with balanced flavors and decent complexity"
"In the glass this beer is a fairly dark nearly opaque brown, the head starts out thick and rocky but falls to a thin layer of tight tan bubbles which throw lace all over the glass. The smell is rich fruitiness and malt with a bit of spice, a hint of alcohol and maybe a touch of an earrthy yeast tone as well. At first the taste this is a bit brash, spicy from hops and alcohol with the malt and fruit underneath. As the beer warms it tends to smooth out and blend a bit better and the malt comes out front and is it ever malty. There is a lot of dark grain maltiness reminiscent of dark bread with chocolate, under those there is a touch of what seems like brown sugar and coffee. When warmer this beer is nice and full in the mouth however it leaves surprisingly little aftertaste just a bit of drying and quick hint of peppery alcohol. A very good beer, nothing strikes me as amazing, however, everything seems to come together so well to make this quite enjoyable to drink."
"D - I could drink many of these in a night - though with the decent ABV (9.2%) I don't know if I should drink more than 3 or 4. Great beer."
"D- This is one great beer. Reminds me of a blend between Rochefort 10 with a St. Bernys 12. Of course there are some major differences, its just first thing that comes to mind."
"The name--with the huge reputation--says it all. A classic beer right here. It's always a pleasure to drink The Rochefort."
"Considering the complexity and size, this is quite a drinkable brew. Highly suggested."
"A nice drinkable beer, especially for this time of year. A beer to be savored and not just pounded, (especially for the price, $8 a bottle). It's a beer to sit back and enjoy."
"D- This is a wonderful beer that is best sipped and enjoyed on a nice cold night- one of the best I have ever had."
"Big disappointment. After reading some of the reviews, I was hoping for a mind-blowing experience and I just didn't have it. I will probably re-rate this in the future to ensure that I didn't get a bad bottle or something but as of now, I just don't get it."
"Pours a murky dark brown with a stone colored khaki head. Aroma of dark rum, raisins, brown sugar, caramel and alcohol. The mouthfeel is medium in body with just the right amount of carbonation. Caramel malt and brown sugar on the forefront. The middle has a nice dark fruit-like quality to it. Some yeast and candy sugar. Molasses and the arrival of alcohol remind me of dark rum, but by no means overpowering. Goes down extremely smooth for its 9.2% abv. Rochefort 8 is an amazing offering. I think I need to go find myself another bottle to keep for the future."
"D- For a high ABV beer I consider it highly drinkable because it's simply delicious."
"Pours a deep ruby with massively dense creamy off white head. Aroma is rather fruity, some vanilla and candi sugar sweetness, somewhat earthy. Extraordinarily well balanced, as nothing jumps out but all is blended well. Luxurious mouthfeel, rich without being heavy, smooth yet very fully carbonated, the beer finishes with a slight cocoa-like taste along with herbal bitterness and mild yeastiness. Alcohol is present, but doesn't detract in any way from the beer. Delightful, of course, as are all of their beers."
"Poured from a 11.2 ounce bottle dated 09 0611. Good amount of carbonation in my Chimay Chalice. Beer smells like brown sugar on hot cereal. Once it gets past the lips it hits very smooth. I am picking up a sweet, malty character. Some spent yeast made its way from the bottle to the glass. This is a very enjoyable beer and something that I look forward to trying again."
"A tremendous beer, really outstanding. The outstanding local Piccadilly just got this in stock for the first time in some time, and it was a must-grab. I'm darn glad I did. I was thoroughly impressed with its presentation, two fingers of head thick atop a brownish-burgundy body, just beautiful. It was highly aromatic, fruity in standard and atypical ways, with citrus mixing with a slight nutty flavor, with banana and berry (cherry?) also represented. Yet the taste was sweet and smooth, easily masking the high ABV (9.2%). This presents the drinker with a lot to taste and ponder, and I'm both impressed and thankful for the chance to delve into this classic that's right up my alley as far as my favorite style, and what is often considered a legend. It certainly lived up to its sterling reputation. Great stuff."
"color is a very deep purplish brown and opaque such that no light gets through it; one can definitely smell a fruity aspect coming off it almost a mix of lemon and raisins in my opinion. the taste at first is nothing worth writing home about bout but a citrusy taste hits the tongue and mixes well with the citrus taste of this brew. a pretty smooth beer and worth the try but really nothing that great."
"All in all, of course this is a nice beer. The look is good, the smells and tastes are nice and the mouth is super nice. However, I cannot rate this as highly as a Chimay. To me, it lacks some of the complexities that the Chimay has perfected. Very good beer though, I enjoyed it tremendously."
"Awesome beer..."
"An easy-to-drink ale with nice balance. Highly recommended."
"D  A little more malt than fruit compared to other beers in the style but very drinkable for 9.2%"
"D- a solid dark ale, ide drink more easily"
"Really good. I truly feel that this is a next to perfect example ofthe style. I hope people send me beer mails of protest, but this brew is delicious. The aroma is warm and inviting, the dark, silky body alluring. The taste is complex and comes at you in levels as it warms. In truth the entire beer just gets better as the temperature rises. My only concern is that I have yet to try the Rochefort 10. What if I like it even better? Do I change this review to reflect my new opinion? Do I petition the site for the first ever 5.5? Whatever happens know that Rochefort is King of the Belgium Strong Dark Trappists."
"7.99 for a 11.2 oz bottle."
"This is by far my favorite beer I tried at the Belgian Beer fest. It is spicey/smokey but not over powering. It has the perfect balance between spice and sweetness. It leaves a pleasant after taste. It's so smooth, you'd never know it was a strong ale..until you stand up that is.."
"Pulled this one off the shelf in the basement where its been hiding for too long. Poured into a goblet at about 60-65 deg. Fizzy off-white head fell quickly leaving a film of tiny bubbles clinging to the surface. Colored a deep reddish brown that is not quite opaque when held to the light. Tiny bits of yeasty sediment show up suspended in the liquid. Smells of caramel with a hint of butterscotch, maybe some vanilla and raisons. A taste reveals a light mouth feel and a ton of carbonation. The 9.2% Abv listed on the label is barely noticeable though. Bitterness come though for a second then fades quickly to a warm malt aftertaste. Quite a bit lighter than Rochefort 10. I could drink several of these in a sitting. Not as flavorful as 10 but still very good; refreshing on a beautiful fall day. Ill think Ill get some more of this."
"D - Frankly, this and big brother are miles apart. A good beer, none the less."
"Drinkability : Très bonne bière trappiste."
"So smooth, so good. Easy to drink but at 9.20% it will do some damage before you know it. Excellent beer."
"The beer pours a cloudy brown color with a thick frothy offwhite head that lasts. The aroma is great. It has a wonderful malt scent that boasts of pale, roasted, and crystal malts. It has a very nice yeast aroma. It's so fruity. It really makes the aroma truely great. The taste is great as well. It has an extremely smooth flavor. The malts and yeast meld together nicely. It mildly fruity with a nice malt base. The alcohol is hidden completely. This is excellent. The finish isn't dry and earthy. It's silky smooth with a bit of esters and malt sweetness. The mouthfeel is perfect. It is a medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. Damn, for a 9.2% beer, it went down so quick. This was very enjoyable. I will be revisiting this one soon."
"Pours a nice dark brown with full head. THe Smell has fruit (berries) and chocolate. The taste again has chocolate, berries but also hints of toffe and lots of malt. The mouthfeel has a bit of sparkle. THe aftertaste lingers nicely. This is very drinkable and I happily would sit down for several at a time."
"This is definately drinkable. Why stop such a good thing."
"Poured from bottle into oversized wine glass (best glassware available). Pours a deep rich brown with light tan head. Very thick 2 finger head that takes a while to settle and becomes very rocky. Leaves behind good amounts of lace and a thin layer of head is retained throughout the glass. Smell is of alcohol, caramel, and toasted grains. Malt and alcohol are present in the taste along with a touch of chocolate, caramel, and toasted grains. I personally cannot detect any fruit other than a touch of raisin. Served cool but as it warms it leaves a terrific creamy mouthfeel that leaves a warming affect as it goes down, also leaves a slighly sour aftertaste. Slightly lower score on drinkability as it is a bit strong. Overall a good beer. Wouldnt be in my top 100 list, but a good beer."
"A very nice Trappist brew that is a must if you like the style. I think some age will take away the alcohol burn and mellow out the bitterness.The 10 will get more attention from me but the 8 is still an awesome brew."
"Pours a brownish red color, with a thick billowing head that settles VERY slowly, leaving some nice lacing and a thick layer of foam floating. Aroma? Absolutely amazing! Faint sugar cane with some raisiny aroma and a faint yeastyness. Wow, taste is amazing as well, with an oakey flavor, along with some lightly roasted malt. Mouthfeel is very smooth, slightly fizzy feeling, just the right amount of aftertaste. A solid belgian dark. Very well balanced, but due to the price, i'd have a hard time drinking this really as anything other than an occasional treat."
"Drinkability- This is just a fabulous brew. Looks great in the glass, smells fantastic and tastes even better. You could sit and easily drink six or seven of these before you knew what hit you. I like this version of Rochefort slightly more than the 10. I think its a bit more balanced and easier drinking. Both excellent brews that are a must try!"
"D - Overall it was an okay drink, but the taste left a little to be desired (more flavor). Maybe not worth the high price tag."
"drinkability is decent, but the high alcohol levels and bite will make this one less drinkable. the brew overall is well balanced, and is a solid example of a belgian strong dark. cheers!"
"Not to be missed."
"Oh man, this is tasty! I think this is my favorite Belgium I've ever had. Sure it's got a high ABV, but you really don't taste it (although you feel it soon enough!). It just had a nice, smooth malty flavor that went down with the greatest of ease. Tantilizing dark brown body as well with the typical overwhelming foamy head. $5 for a 330ml is a bargain at these flavors!"
"Comment: I love the Rochefort 10 (it is my beer of choice) but the 8 is a strong companion and stands on its own as an excellent beer. Awesomewhat a beer should be."
"Pours a brown sugar color with a big head and spurratic lacing. Smells of brown sugar, fig, dried fruit. Tastes as it smells along with a slight lemon tea finish. Extremely smooth. Medium in the mouth with great carbonation. ABV is non existant. So drinkable its not funny. Those monks know what they are friggin doing."
"Drinkability: I thought it was good and fairly easy to drink one. A good fall warmer."
"Very drinkable, especially for the amount of alcohol involved. The fruitiness and the alcohol content might get to you over long sessions. But this is a wonderful beer and I'd love to try a long session with it."
"D- This is definitely one to sip on but for the ABV it is very drinkable."
"drinkability is good. i really love all the fruit. well balanced. a really great beer. i think this is my favourite of the rochefort lineup."
"Hazy deep chestnut hue, topped by an formidably thick, almost animated light tan head supported by prodigious bubbles. After what seems to be an eternity, the head settles and leaves signature lace. Tart cherries and mellow chocolate upfront in aroma, along with raisiny notes and caramel from the dark candi sugar. Buttery malt becomes noticeable as the beer warms and breathes. Mild chocolate and banana are perceptible at first in flavor and are ensued by notes of darkly caramelized fruit and a date - like sweetness. Hop bitterness is only indirectly noticed by its offsetting of malt sweetness. Full in body, w/ a dextrinous, liquid velvet mouthfeel. Finishes w/ waves of dark caramel lingering. Alcohol warmth slowly emerges as an afterthought. Rochefort 8 is fabulous. The residual sweetness is well controlled and the combination of chocolate notes and fruit is superlative. Although very flavorful, Rochefort 8 maintains a elegant mellowness. Outstanding to say the least. Rochefort 10 should be a treat!"
"Great slightly toned down version of the Rochefort 10"
"Quite drinkable, even with the alcohol kick. This one is a nice sipper. After dinner, on the deck, or like tonight. Watching ""The Bronx is Burning"" with some xtra sharp cheddar and triscuits. Ya know what, it's a good night."
"D--I really love this beer. To me, there a very few that compare in terms of overrall quality, I know it is way too much to expect, but I could drink this every day of my life. If you have never tried this or the 10, it is a must. Belgian beer is the best beer in world and the Rochefort ""Trappist"" beers are at the forefront!"
"Drinkability- Very, but with the price and alcohol content, I would suggest against drinking 4-5 in a session. Clearly one of my favourites. I'll be buying more next week."
"after adding the sediment there is a nice added body with a slight added doughy like texture, but still very subdued to the point of almost wateriness."
"Drinkability - Wonderful complex smell and flavors. This is a great BSDA."
"Pours a dark plum color with brown hues. One and a half cream colored pillow like looking head has excellent retention. Sticky thick lacing down the glass. Burnt brown sugar, dark fruits, and a touch of chocolate notes round out the nose. Spicy yeast with an excellent malt profile of dark fruits and brown sugar. Plums, prunes, and molasses. Smooth and silky mouthfeel with a residual sweetness left on the tongue. Abv goes unnoticed in the flavor, but apparent in the aroma."
"Pours a dark ruby amber/brown color. Little to no head on this pour. Smell is of dried fruits, prunes and figs. Taste is like wine almost, grapes and fruit. Limited carbonation on this one, and it kind of tastes like a sparkling soft drink. Had this one time at a tasting and it was different. Will try another fresh bottle again sometime."
"Awesome beer, great mouthfeel."
"Root beer color with mixed bubbly head. Smell of red licorice, spice. Taste of mocha, burnt sugar, dried plums, cooked plantain and butter. Finishes with lightly bitter red licorice and caramel. Excellent and complex flavor throughout. Outstanding. One of the finest of it's style."
"D: This is to be enjoyed. Hold it tightly and remember to sip. No gulps allowed here. The high alcohol content makes you respect it's nature."
"Pours a dark black beer that's entirely lacking in highlights - almost opaque in it's blackness. A delicious looking frothy inch and a half of foam on top. This one looks fantastic. Nose is fairly mild, although still quite tasty. Strong on sweet molasses malt and crazy spices. Taste is exquisite: tons of buttery caramel malt, lots of cherries and raisins, along with some citrusy hints. Taste continues to transform as the beer continues. Chocolate and some light coffee show up as well as more roasted malt. Feel is full-bodied and creamy. This one was fantastic. Incredibly tasty and a pleasure to drink. Really fantastic - an unlimited budget would find me drinking these daily."
" Drinkability is limited by high-price, possible lack of freshness, etc. Love to try this one fresh and properly aged, though. Ill return."
"Poured from a 330 ml bottle. A hazy, mahogany brown colour, with a thin tan head, and wonderful lacing. Nose has a bit of banana, alcohol - kinda like rum. This beer is smooth, creamy and full bodied. Alcohol is warming, and flavours are complex. Full of dark fruit, phenols, very malty and lots of toffee flavours. Amazing beer...is all i can say."
"Drinkability: Not sessionable, but highly drinkable for such a high gravity beer. While this isn't as talked about as Rochefort 10, it's nearly as good and has enough of its own character to make it worth seeking out."
"Dark brown color, with a frothy appearance. Pleasant sweet alcohol smell. The initial sips have a sweet wood flavor, with a late sourness in the aftertaste, which fades into a rye grain flavor. Light-medium body. Remains drinkable despite the alcohol (9.2%). Overall, a good beer for an after dinner drink."
"11.2 oz bottle. Pours murky brown with a thick, tan head that is moderately lasting. Light aroma of plums or prunes. Sweet initial taste and finishes with a dry, cola-like flavor. Light and bubbly body with a thin texture. Very drinkable, better than the Orval and without a doubt worth the money."

"This tasting was shortly after a Chimay Blue (to see if my initial notes stood up to another really good B.S.D.A.). My initial impressions were correct - this beer is fantastic - the monks are freakin' geniuses."
"Nothing I would drink on a regular basis, but a certain contender for an after dinner, ""digestif"" beer."
"Overall, it's a good Beer. I'm looking forward to the # 10 that I have in my fridge."
"Drinkability- It's interestig, but the spiciness and over-carbonation turned what was a good beer into a mediocre one."
"mouthfeel perfect. drinkability excellent. ive had the 10 lots of times but this is my first try of the 8..its hard to say this one is lacking in any way, these Rocheforts are simply some of the best damn beer you will ever put in your mouth."
"This is a very complex beer that should be savoured in small sips. Be sure to serve it at a correct temperature, i recommend +17C to get the maximum amount of taste."
"Drinkability: Only one bottle, so I drank it sssllllooowww. Can't wait to try the 10!"
"D: Drinkability is suprisingly good for a 9.2% ale, not refreshing per se, but not cloying and overly alcoholic making each sip a serious endeavour, like some highly alcoholic brews can be."
"This beer is a nice ruby red color with a thick head. Thick lacing is present. The smell is fruity with more than a hint of alcohol. The taste is plums and a bit if underlying smoke. The mouthfeel is carbonated and the alcohol has a nice way of saying hello this early in the morning. This will certainly warm the tops of your ears and cheeks. A nice well rounded brew. One of the better Belgian brews I have had."
"A very good Trappist. Fruity, sweet (but not too sweet) with a hint of sourness on the back end - but not so much that it's a bad thing. Definitely drinkable. If I see this one sitting on a shelf, I'll probably pick it up again although I wouldn't drive across town to get it. I know, this is the same review I gave the 10 but I found them to be very similar. If you haven't tried it, pick one up."
"Highly recommended"
"Pours a murky brown with a coarsely carbonated head. Toffee and raisin aroma; no hint of hops. Flavor is multilayered; not as much as the 10, but much cleaner on the palate and more drinkable. Carbonation is medium and there is a slight bite in the finish. Absolutely incredible drinkability for a 9.2 % abv ale."
"I could drink it nearly as easily as I could a glass of water and there is probably no other 9.2% beer I could say that about especially with such a dark malt profile, but on the other side of that coin it needs a bit more character to be truly excellent in my opinion. I'd certainly never pass on one though."
"improvements on. A thicker body and stronger, sweeter fruity taste would make this a sure 10."
"Rochefort 8 pours a hazy deep brown with a thick foamy head. Smell is ripe dark fruits, sweet with a lot of dark maltiness. Taste is sharp at first, giving way to a rich fruity easters. The initial sharp spiciness gives way to an incredibly smooth, rich malt flavor, perfectly balanced and deliciously complex. The alcohol is almost completely hidden. As the beer warms, the sharpness decreases and it becomes even more delicious. I think I like this beer more than the 10, it just seems more balanced to me."
"Poured from a 330ml bottle into a tulip. This ale poured a hazy brown color with visible carbonation and a big, foamy tan head. Excellent retention and lacing. The aroma of this beer was full of yeast notes, bread, grapes, dark fruits, and some sweet malts. The flavor was very, very rich. It included buttery bread notes along with a crisp fruitiness, and also a bit of caramel. Excellent velvety, creamy mouthfeel with fizzy, active carbonation stinging your tounge along with a nice alcohol warmth. All I can say is...awsome!! A must try. This is one top notch ale that is sure to be a favorite for years to come!"
"Served in a chalice, the beer pours a hazy brown with a half inch tan head. Head retention and lacing are both good. It smells like dark fruit, bread and caramel, a very nice sweet malty smell. Taste is similar to the smell, except that there's also an earthy, peppery spicyness in the taste along with the dark fruit and caramel. Mouthfeel is medium, it's smooth and silky and has a lot of carbonation (but not too much). Drinkability is pretty good, but would be perfect if the carbonation was down a little bit. Alcohol isn't too noticeable at all. Overall a very good beer, it's nice and enjoyable."
"Pours into tulip, dark brown, huge head. Smell is malty, bread, some fruit and alcohol. Taste is malt, biscuit, with a raisony acloholic back. Mouthfeel is relatively light although alcohol hits and lingers. Need to study the style some more don't have much experience with it. Overall impression is good, pretty pricey, an occasion brew."
"I'd buy this one over several of the other Belgians I have had but I wouldn't seek it out often due to its $5.50 price tag. Looking forward to the 10 tomorrow."
"D- A bit too strong and dry to merit a high drinkability score, but definitely a better beer overall than the 6... I'll do the 10 tomorrow, and we'll choose a winner :-)"
"poured into a goblet, this had a thick, dark layer of sediment at the bottom which i left in the bottle. the appearance is a hazy amber/brown with a tan, creamy head and incredible lacing that does not want to go away. the first smell that hits me is a whiskey aroma. was this barrel aged? also notes of toffee, dark fruit, candied fruit, and some earthy mustiness. barnyardy kinda nose. taste is of sweet malts and alcohol with some of the above aromatics translating onto the tongue. a vague spicy character is present that i'm not familiar with. somehow the carbonation is still lively enough in this big beer to balance the sweet malts. any hop bitterness is in the background and difficult to pick up. this is a showcase of malt, yeast, and however they make this beer. mouthfeel is big-bodied but not as much as the abv lets on. long, warming finish with some alcohol burn. this is definitely a sipping beer, i couldn't do more than one of these, unless it was cold and i had a big, meaty cigar to pair with it. this is more reminiscent of a liquer or madeira than a beer."
"D: The 9.2% alcohol is virtually indiscernible. Mellow yet incredibly flavorful and complex. Very easy to drink. It might be the best Belgian beer that I have yet to try. Absolutely phenomenal."
"Very drinkable with a nice smooth mouthfeel. An unoffensive nicely rounded dubel, though nothing exceptional. Just solid."
"This beer has such complexity that I think it will take more than the first 11.2oz to get a handle on this one. Definitely one I'll return to, but like all the trappist ales, a treat for a special occasion."
"D - Overall this was fantastic, may actually be my favorite belgian to date, and dare I say better then the westy. Really a good all around late night sipping brew. A+ on this one."
"D--very drinkable....the alcohol is masked very well and the brew has a solid, ""standard"" Belgian taste."
"Thinking about it now, I've realized this is the first authentic Trappist beer I've ever had. It certainly did not disappoint. Those monks seriously know what they're doing. The best word I can think of to describe this beer is 'humble'. It doesn't try to be over the top or something that it isn't. It lets it's amazing craftsmanship speak for itself. I can't wait to try the 10, or anything from the other 5 Trappists."
"Not a humble beer by any means though its flavors seem thoroughly smoothed together and go on for miles."
"Drinkability: High! Fairly light for the style and easy-drinking."
"Not a session beer (which isn't a bad thing necessarily) , but a wonderful beer to sit with and contemplate. Definitely worth seeking this one out. I know I will again."
"This is a beautifully crafted brew, not exactly a session brew but an awesome beer for a special occasion. Put against a cheese plate, this one can handle a variety of creamy and sharp flavors."
"Fantastic beer overall, but I wish it was a little cheaper to have several at a time. A nice change of pace though if you are looking for something new in the store."
"Pours a cloudy brown color with an explosive off-white head, not much in lacing but some. The smell is not overly strong, has a carob and chocolate aroma to it. The taste is of a hint of red grapes and a nice roasted nut flavor, some chocolate. The feel is much smoother than the #6, not nearly as carbonated but still quite fizzy. Moderate body, finishes a tad bitter. Not much better than the 6, less carbonated."
"I've been looking for beer from Trappistes Rochefort for a while, so when I saw this in a local market, I had to pick it up. Now I just need 6 and 10. Anyways, poured from the bottle into a pint glass, beer is a cloudy amber brown color with a huge, sparkling off-white head. Smell is slightly sweet with Belgian and brown sugar, a bit of fruit; raisins and dates, and a touch of spice. Taste is initially sweet like the smell, Belgian sugars and raisins. The taste transitions nicely to a spicy warm alcohol finish. For being 9.2%, it is pretty well covered but still noticeable. The mouthfeel is medium-full bodied with a warming smoothness about it. A drinkable beer no doubt, but at almost $6.50 for just a 33cL bottle I won't be quaffing this one... sip and enjoy."
"Drinkability: A great trappist brew, very nice feel and complexity. So much different flavors everytime i take a sip, kinda hard to pick them out but thats great! Thank you very much monks, and god."
"D: Interesting beer. The last part of the process was very good but up to it was brutally mediocre."
"Served at cellar temperature in a Westvleteren chalice. Poured a deep, dark ruby brown color. About an inch and a half of pillowy white head formed. Great retention with this one. Tons of thick lace throughout. Smell: Subtle wine like aromas, plum, and sweet notes of raisins. Tasted slightly of papery oxidation, more dark fruits( plum , raisin), and brandy soaked cherries. Also some sweet sugary tones,with some peppery spice and minor alcohol heat. Plenty of carbonation. Nice and smooth in the mouth with tons of complexity. Very drinkable and enjoyable."
"This is quite nice. I have had this one many times but for this review, relaxing and drinking this beer was as pleasant as it gets. The 12 is my fav but thi works just fine!"
"M-Creamy smooth and chewy, coats the entire mouth, pallette and thoat as it goes down. Carbonation slightly marrs with a prickly feel."
"Rochefort 8 is complex and accesible. There is a balance of sweet and tart elements. Try it. There's much to love in this Belgian ale."
"D: This is a very interesting beer, excellent in most every way, would for sure get this one again."
"Poured with a big, foamy, frothy, very light tan head with lots of lace. Color is an odd hazy, almost opaque brown. Nose is incredible: full of very ripe, juicy dark and red fruits like plums, berry, apples, pears, peaches, figs, and their jams. Body is a hair thin. Drinkable in an odd way. Love to be able to afford to cook with it. Great juicy fruit finish."
"Enough to make one consider joining a monastery."
"As a side note, serving temperatures should definitely be followed... I poured this up right out of the fridge, and it definitely wasn't nearly as good as when it warmed to the right temperature."
"Highly carbonated, but also very smooth and light bodied, which I usually don't like so much, but this is amazing. Highly, highly drinkable."
"The drinkability on this is not the highest amongst the Trappists. There is a lot of dept to unlock, but I find the roastiness to be a bit much, and overall the taste is not so great that I just can't get enough. After this, I'm going to have to revisit the the 12, which I've always considered perhaps my favorite beer (and have had both in Europe and the US), because this was a bit of a let down. Good, but not fantastic, although I don't think I've had the 8 before, and preceded it with a pair of Westmalle tripel's, so perhaps I raised the bar to high. I just prefer to drink different beers in order of least to more robust taste, which is why I had this last."
"One of the very best trappists and that is saying something."
"As other fellow BA member said, I think expected more from this beer. Not bad though."
"My first commercial example of the style, and while not disappointed I will say that I expected a little more."
"Mouthfeel was full and zesty."
"Poured into a tulip glass a murky strawberry coloration, with a huge white head that faded quickly enough into a significantly smaller, appealing looking head with great retention. Smell was somewhat on the boozy side, with lots of ripe fruit flavors, and honey. Taste was very pepperyat first, but faded away into huge malty fruit flavors. Hops are minimal, but the carbonation is somewhat high. It turns foamy initially when it hits the palate, but calms down quickly. Quite an interesting beer. One was not enough. Cheers"
"Overall: This is one of the best Trappists I've had, and is an excellent example, maybe an archetype, of a dubbel or a dark strong. You have to look pretty hard to find any flaws. Don't drink it too cold; colder temps mute the wonderful nose and muddy up the taste."
"The delicious flavors without excessive sweetness makes this very drinkable. I can't imagine ever turning one down."
"Poured from the bottle into a belgian beer chalice. Appears dirty brown in color with orange tint where the light shines through. Good, two-finger head, but man is this beer uber-carbonated. Excellent head retention, but not much lace to speak of, which is interesting because I would have expected lace from this beer. Crazy bubbles. Rich, fruity aroma. Smells like a malty fruit salad. Oooh, this is a delicious beer too. Really fruity. Dark fruits with some mild spices (maybe some nutmeg in there?). Malty, with slight hints of pepper and smoke in the finish. Tasty stuff, this Rochefort 8. The carbonation ovewhelms the mouthfeel, but it does settle down after it sits for a while. Might be a good one to cellar for a while and let it mellow out. A highly drinkable brew here. Those crafty Trappist monks have done a fine job here."
"Poured from a 33cl bottle with best by date of Feb 2011. Had a murky darkish brown color. Had a smallish head that went away in a blink of an eye. No foam or lacing. The smell was fruity, spicy and alcohol in equal parts. It was weak at first but grew as it warmed. Mouthfeel was good with a nice mix of creamy and carb. Taste was really good but I'm having a hard time nailing down why but who cares as long as it is good. Overall a really tasty brew, even the wife liked it, that well deserves it's rep and ranking. That said, it would only be an occasional beer for me as I like to spread the Belgian Strongs out over time. Highly recommend. (4.0, RB, T, Y)"
"Too much carbonation, but still pretty drinkable for a brew of this magnitude. All in all, very glad I bought two of these so I could cellar one of them... I'll let you know in a year how this brew is intended to taste."
"With Sigur Ros "" Viarar Vel Til Loftarasa "" on the Hi-Fi and some golf on the tube I thought I would pour Rochefort 8 into my chalice . As my hobby /quest goes on I am trying to pour the brews in the proper glassware . Freshness date was 10 . 05 . 07:52 . Poured to a beautiful dark brown color . Looking at it , the brown color turns I lighter hue as you stare into it . I just can't stop looking at it . Hopefully this brew taste as good as the music . The head is there but reduces as I still stare at it . Tasting this is divine . Chocolate / Nutty flavor and candy . Crunchie bar flavor comes to mind . Now the ABV is high , there is no burn but , my cheeks are turning red . The glow is here . I have some 10's around too . Will they taste like this ? My my . This brew is as good as the music . Rochefort is a joy to drink . Putting this off due to everyone reviewing this was a mistake . I will buy this again . Now if my reviewing skills were as good as this beer ...Can't wait to reviews the 10 & 6 .."
"Extremely well crafted and a gem of a Trappist ale. So enjoyable and fulfilling. Phenomenal drinkability level. Recommended."
"Ya gotta be sober enough to pour carefully, it is powerful ABV-wise, and can be expensive...so I'll have to leave it just short of a 5 for drinkability."
"Pourde a cloudy chocolate with a nice head and very good lacing. Smell was a nice blend of raisins, bisuits and light hops. I was hoping for more on the tatse level, considering its ratings. However, it was above averag, but not outstanding. Taste was brandy-like with amalt and molasses elements...slight hop presence also. Mouthfeel and drinkability were good with dryness and slight bitterness being the main components."
"A good malty beer with a little bit of phenolic kick that doesn't ruin the beer. This beer gives the tongue a challenge with the high complexity from the array of flavors. As any other Trappist ale, it's recommended."
"A pretty solid example, but really need to do a side-by-side tasting. Very good on its own, but tough to rank against some other classics."
"A nice complex Belgian ale."
"Overall a unique and world class Trappist ale. Dry, spicy and bold, but altogether smooth. Warming and soothing. Restoring. Very good."
"Medium bodied. Hides alcohol fairly well, though it gives it a nice warming effect and a bit of flavor."
"Comments: Another in the list of trappist beers has lived up to its hype. Delicious, albeit strong. This is not one to take lightly. Let it warm up to room temp, let it sit on your palette & express itself."
"The flavor has high notes of a citrus fruit but that characteristic is offset by the effect from the sweet smell of molasses. Thank you Sam-the-Beer-Man for the opportunity to try this one!!!"
"Drinkabilty great as well, again find myself wanting more."
"Velvety mouthfeel, very heavy and sweet, I cannot have more than one at a time, but this one is very satisfying."
"Drinkability: Delicious, big and sweet, almost enough sugar to make me want something more bitter or spicy, but it's the style. Very well done, a favorite."
"D: ABV limits this to maybe a 750, but a great beer. I'm really enjoying exploring these Belgians. Can't wait to try the 10."
"Drinkability: A wonderful example of the style. I had some Chimay last night, and while both good, I think this one is more complex and subtle."
"stuff when you can. Alcohol by volume 9.2%."
"M&D - the flavors are layered well, and blended masterfully, even the girlfriend enjoyed it enough to request a second sip, that says more than anything i can write here. a sweet mouthcoat that goes the whole way down, theres a reason why these true trappists are rates so dang high, because they should be"
"11.2 oz. bottle poured into my snifter a dark reddish/brown color with a small tan head that leaves some spots of lace around the glass. The smell is of dark fruit maybe some figs and also a brown sugar or molasses. Taste is hard to describe but is slightly sweet almost a syrup flavor with a bit of yeast and a lightly carbonated feel. The complex flavors seem to hide alot of the alcohol and make this a delicious and very drinkable brew."
"I hope I don't need to tell you it's not sessionable, for every possible reason (including price if you're not in belgium.) drinkable for a BSDA, but not sessionable. this is a beer to sip and savor."
"Drinkability for a Belgian Strong Dark Ale is a relative thing, as you don't exactly go knocking ten of these down during the big game. It's a sipping beer (the alcohol content requires it), but I'm sure I could sip it all night."
"Following up on what most reviews have already stated, this beer, when poured, was a dark brown, almost red in color. The head, which was nearly half the glass, was carmel in color. As far as smell, the overpowering scent that I encountered was cinnamon. It made for a nice taste when combined with the other flavors, which weren't nearly as apparent to a rookie beer reviewer such as myself. While in the mouth, the beer definitley ""wakes up"" your tastebuds and finishes very smooth, which impressed me. As far as drinkability goes, I must say, be careful. At 9.2% alcohol and its great taste, it could be a short evening for you if you have too many."
"This beer is very drinkable, with its higher alcohol content masked by the flavors of the malt. An excellent beer."
"Pours a murky, reddish-brown with a medium-density thin tan head that leaves a bit of lacing as it dissipates. Smells of cloves, raisins, plums, nutmeg, and a touch of cinnamon. Taste is a sweet, caramel malt, followed by the crisp spices and a warming alcohol finish. A bit brighter than the 10, but similar. Mouthfeel is oily and chewy, with nice carbonation. Having downed a number of these during a marathon bocce tournament, I can attest to the drinkability. It may be a bit much for those that prefer their beer light and refreshing, but if its flavor you crave, you can sip these all day long."
"This beer tastes great if you use it to make a stew. The results were great!"
"Pours a cloudy, dark brown with a big head that goes down a bit but lasts throughout. The smell is rich with dark fruit, spices, and alcohol. The taste is a complex blend of malt, dark fruit, spices and alcohol. A tartness comes in at the end. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with some carbonation tingle. Drinkability is high for a 9.2% ABV. It would be easy to get carried away with this one so you have to show restraint. Overall, a great beer that should be savored. The flavors and smoothness really come out as it warms."
"Overall, it's definitely worth a try, but Rochefort 10 is still my favorite from this Trappist brewery."
"Poured dark brown color and slightly cloudy. It smelled fruity with a hint of what seemed to be cinnamon. A very nice strong nose. When tasted it had a slight caramel flavor with a moderate finish. The finish became pretty sweet and almost tasted like sugar water. Overall I really enjoyed this beer."
"If the alcohol was a little more in balance, this would be a just about a perfect beer."
"This is, quite frankly, my favorite beer. Drinking it is almost a religious experience. Quite difficult to find near where I live now, but I managed to get a few for New Years. Never fails to disappoint; in fact I become more fond of it over time. Complex and amazing on all fronts, this is a beer that people should at least try once."
"The flavors of chocolate and caramel blended perfectly with my pork's dark and spicey sauce. There was a hint of fruit in the tase, but I mostly got cocoa and caramel. Like some of the other trappists I've tried, this seemed a mellow but very tasty brew. Could have passed for a quad in my book. I'll have to put this head to head with the 10 some time soon. You should too."
"I think you have to pour this differently cause the head rises on itself way after you pour it."
"Even chilled to a medium-cool serving temp (~50F), poured ridiculously foamy. Head is huge, rocky, and just a tad off-white towards beige. Body is deep amber/copper with a touch of haze, not especially cloudy. Aroma is caramelly sweet and resinous, with a prominent floral hop component; maybe even edging towards lavender-soapy. Waiting several minutes for the head to die down so I can take a taste... Carbonation is very prominent, a sharp buzzing on the tongue throughout each sip. The initial taste is round and floral, with a somewhat abrasive and alcoholic bitterness. Then fruity sweet with a hint of prunes, and finally a sweet smoky finish. Hmm. Honestly it kind of tastes like someone poured Mad Dog 20/20 into a hoppy brown ale."
"D - This is an outstanding beer. The flavors are really amazing."
"Poured from a 33cl bottle into a Chimay glass. The beer has a beautiful deep brown color and a thick off-white head. The beer has a great malty scent. The taste is very smooth and creamy with the classic sweet malty flavor typical of belgians. There is a slight break in the smoothness with some of the roasted malts and a slight hint of spiciness. The mouthfeel is perfect. It feels smooth and full, just like a beer should. The drinkability is extremely high. I will certainly go and find more of this beer and drink some now and age some for later."
"D: The abv makes this one to watch out for, but the taste and its complexity warrants another round, if not more. Excellent selection, would highly recommend."
"A masterpiece. This ale deserves its reputation as one of Belgiums finest. The waves of complexity seem as though theyre being actively directed across the tongue. Suprisingly smooth. A great cold weather sipper!"
"Poured into a Delirium Tremens tulip. Huge beige head formed atop of a beautiful dark rubyish body. Tons of lace. Aromas of rum raisin, black cherry, and plenty of candi syrup. Very malty and rich, yet light on the tongue. Syrup, molasess, exotic sugars, peppery. Slight alcohol burn. World classic in every sence of the word."
"Pours a murky deep brown color with noticeable flakes of sediment floating throughout the beer. Nose is rich and complex with aromas of rum-soaked raisins, dark cherries, ripe bananas, and fig preserves. Taste begins with a bit of brown sugar and dark caramel followed by a bit of Belgian spice and notes of chocolate covered cherries. Simply deliciousa marvelous brew."
"Poured into a Westmalle goblet, initial strong release of carbonation to a short but distinct 1/2 inch head, burned copper/red tinted dark cherry color. Very light lacing, but dissapointing head retention. Although a nice swirl of the glass in a large goblet releases substantial flavor/re-creams the head (I recommend to continuously swirl the glass as you consume)... and releases the smell of bitter sweet pear/apple pie/faint cinamon and sugary infested yeast/alcohol remints. The smells definitely diminish quickly, but to get the initial glimse of them is well worth it. I liked the slightly creamy, and strong mouthfeel, heavy and bubbly to the tounge with a nice leftover taste to the side of the cheeks and roof of my mouth. Fantastic drinkability, could definitely sit down relax by a fire and drink several of these. For a beer with 9,2% alcohol, I think it has a very nice subdued sweetness and nice bite, without any overpowering alcohol smell/flavor."
"Not impressed, this beer is way too heavy, bitter alcohol, and lack of good flavor makes this a bland beer."
"Exceptionally drinkable in the wee small hours."
"Very thick, oily mouthfeel. Liiiittle bit of alcohol, with a lot of the dark fruits sticking around. Brown sugar, sherry, and dark rye bread are also present. Not much carbonation at all. Thick, semi-bitter aftertaste that gets a little cloying after a full bottle."
"Drinks fine, just a little too young ( I think)"
"The taste is as one would expect of a brew with this smell. The surprise is the finish. Really dry, and with almost no residuals. Alcohol is evident, and it warms very well. It feels teriffic in the mouth, and despite it's high alcohol level, is quite quaffable. Do yourself a favor and savor this one for awhile. I didn't do a very good job at this, but it did stick around long enough for me to know that she warms really well."
"Notes: A thoroughly enjoyable brew from Rochefort. I think I could drink a lot of this if it weren't for the 9.2% ABV."
"Very easy to drink for something so strong. Poured it fresh out of the fridge (much too cold). As it has warmed up to room temperature it is disappearing faster and faster."
"This beer pous a chocolate color with lots of carbonation. There is quite a lot of yeast in the bottom of the bottle so thank goodnes I was paying attention. The carbonation quickly escapes the beer, forming a huge tan head of foam. As the drink is quaffed, the head receedes leaving behind a lot of lace. The flavor and aroma are both very complex. I don't even know how to properly define the flavors. A beer like this makes a person want to get trained in sensory analysis. The beer is quite heavy with a good creamy and warming sensation as it goes down. This is a very good beer!"
"A very good Belgian strong dark. Much like Chimay Red in my opinion, but it still has better and stronger flavors, and a superior mouthfeel. Definitely recommended."
"-Oelergud"
"Drinkability was good, I gave it a lower mark because of the ABV. It would only take a few of these and I would be loopy."
"Opaque dark brown body with a few fingers thick off-white head. Fruity smell, though I'm not sure which fruit. Some spice also. Malty taste with some fruit... Chocolate? Fairly full-bodied. A nice complex ale, as one might expect... Fairly enjoyable, but not my favorite trappist ale..."
"Overall: This is a good beer. I will buy it more often."
"Complex flavor and creaminess make this beer very easy to drink. Very smooth. It rivals the Rochefort 10."
"11.2oz brown bottle with numbers on the front 29 06 10 - perhaps a drink before date? This has been in my fridge for a year or so. Pours a chestnut brown with a big fluffy 2 finger head with nice lace. Aromas of sweet malts, brown sugar, sherry, raisin, and alcohol. Tastes are very similar except for the much noticeable hop presence. Alcohol has a definate noticeable presence. Lots of flavor here, but not as smooth as I would like. High carbonation makes it a bit hard to drink."
"smooth, full-bodied, delicious. this is obviously expected from any trappist ale, especially after trying the rochefort 10. but this beer surprised me with a really strong flavor and big bitter finish. not nearly as sweet as i thought it would be from the smell. the higher abv is obvious, not hidden at all, but it doesn't bother me. not quite as complex or memorable as the 10, but this is still a great beer that should be required drinking for all BAs."
"Very different to its big brother."
"Creamy body that I would say is Medium-Full. Carbonation is abundant. This is a pretty heavy, and expensive, beer. I'm not sure if I could put more than a couple of these down because they are so complex. It really is a meal in itself, but its a pleasure to drink it."
"this is awesome, i want to drink this everyday."
"The pour into my 25 cL Chimay chalice raises an impressive and slow to fall head of about three fingers. It's very light tan, and leaves copious lacing. The body is a murky brown, ruby when backlit. The nose is sweet and juicy, with notes of caramel, dark fruits, pepper, yeast, and fine cigar tobacco. The taste is surpassingly smooth, sweet, and malty. It has definite peppery notes, and a lighter tobacco taste. This has a slight chocolate milk character in the finish, and some sweet berry notes. There's so much more here that I can't quite put my finger on! The alcohol is also quite well hidden. The yeast pour doesn't alter the taste for my pallette, since the dregs seems to be only a few small brown drops. The mouth is on the light side of medium, with a very smooth carbonation. This is an excellent beer, one that I'm very glad I was able to resist for a year!"
"Darn it."
"God bless the Trappist Monks!"
"A very solid Belgian, and one that I highly recommend."
"D: This is one of the best, but i have a 10 sitting here so we will see. :)"
"Top 5 material."
"D- Fills you up pretty fast with the carbonation, but with the very nice complexity every sip is a new experience."
" Palate seems to lack focus. It is at once sweet from a wonderful blend of dark and sweet caramel malts, spicy and peppery from the yeast, and mildly herbal from the hops. A slight letdown from such a wonderful aroma, but still quite nice. Body is rich, smooth, and creamy, almost perfect. A thoroughly pleasurable experience to drink - very slowly - over the course of the evening."
"Garnet brown colour. Large stable dense head with lacing on the glass. Fruit and chocolate aroma. Surprisingly, the aroma seems to have some kind of citric and zesty hop character to it as well. Tastes of citrus fruit, spices and chocolate. Rich roasted malt flavour and some sweetness. Alcohol is masked well but contributes a nice warmth. Mouthfeel is prickly and full bodied. Very drinkable and tasty dark ale."
"And the alcohol fumes (it's a 9 percenter after all!) remind you that this is a real drink... It's not like (for example) a Duvel which can sneak up on you without warning. I'd forgotten just how good this beer was.... it had been in my cellar for at least a year which might have helped."
"This is good, and what I expected out of the 10, but was letdown. Rich chewy mouthfeel with vibrant ripe fruit exploding in the mouth. Drupes dominate with cherries and plums battling it out for control of the main flavor. A cognac like presence is felt towards the finish, as the alcohol makes itself known. Aeration reveals even further depths of cocoa and toffee. A beautiful and exceptional beer, this is what I had hoped the 10 would be."
"I highly recommend this beer to anyone that wants to try a piece of Belgium brewing at its greatest."
"Shared a bottle of this with some friends. Best-by date of 3/23/10. Poured a lovely cloudy caramel color with a small, brownish-head. Looks like someone melted the caramel off a caramel apple into a glass. And what do you know - smell dominated by caramel apple, alcohol, yeast. Taste centers around the caramel as well. Malty, toasty, licorice, similar to a good Scotch Ale. Mouthfeel was bright and fizzy; plenty of tiny bubbles. Packs a bit of a punch, but makes for wonderful sipping. Highly recommended."
"Body: Medium/Medium light"
"D: The ale is a well made, very drinkable ale, but I find that it does not hold up to either the 10 or the 6."
"D: Gonna buy some more of this and the 10 here soon and drink em side by side. I am really digging this and will get it again for sure."
"I could drink a few of these at a sitting."
"So that's that. Maybe I got a bad bottle."
"The 9%+ is well hidden, with a touch of medicine alcohol burn  not unpleasant. Very nice, but not at the high import price."
"I can imagine Friar Tuck brewing this, with the smell of the forest right in the beer. Anyway, this is really excellent stuff."
"Pour's a hazy brownish-ruby color, with a couple of centimeters of white head. Aroma is malty. Flavor is complex; raisins, yeasty, a little sweet. Alcohol is apparent, but not overwhelming. Feels like a mouthful; almost chewable, but in great way. Highly drinkable."
"Very enjoyable"
"Dark in color, the entire body is a deep ruby if the light hits it right. 2 cm off white head forms, but falls to about 1 cm and lasts that way until the end of the beer. Awesome. Very sweet and fruity aroma, ripe raspberries, strawberries, banana, plum, and some brown sugar/molasses there as well. The taste was still very sweet, but revealed more dark fruit flavors, plum, raisin, dates, blackberries. Definitely some yeasty flavors, but the esters were more noticeable. The mouthfeel was sweet and dry, great drinkablility for a 9.2% beer. The alcohol was noticeable, but not off putting. I did try the Trappist Rochefort 10 before I tried this one, I was far from disappointed with the 8, but if I could go back I would have flipped that order, the 10 was a bit more complex and outstanding."
"Drinkability: Light body, heavy flavor, perfect drinking. Probably the highlight for me of the trappist tasting. A beer I'll make a point of coming back to. Simply wonderful."
"This was a bit of an overall let down after savoring every last drop of the Rochefort 10. Perhaps this bottle was not 100% of what it could be?? It will worth another shot down the road."
"D - A very tasty beer that is definatly easy and enjoyable to drink. It was very complex and I am looking forward to re-reviewing this beer a few times."
"Pours a deep, dark brown, permitting light only around the edges, and forming a consistent, light brown head. Visible carbonation and a good deal of sediment was noted. Smelled sweet and grapey. Up front, the taste was neutral followed by a blast of sweet malts, then grains in the aftertaste, with very warm alcohol throughout. Midway through, the hop presence was greater than in other similar Belgians. Towards the end the malts took over again, which was more enjoyable in this case. There was also a tartness to the sweet flavors, reminding me just a tiny bit of sour apples and some berries. Mouthfeel was kind of thin. A good beer, but not my top choice, though I have a feeling that this beer could vary quite a bit from glass to glass. I will certainly be up for multiple tastings."
"Drinkability/Overall: amazing ""sneaks up on you"" development from dark, roasted yeast and floral notes to rich, sweeter fruit and liquor. The big winner of Trappapalooza/Trappaganza '06, knocking off his big and little brothers and a host of other Trappists for the crown."
"Pouring a nice head, the beer itself is brown and cloudy. The head lasted for several minutes. The smell is of a strong malt. The taste is that of a creamy malt flavor, with a slight hoppy taste. The mouthfeel is thick, but smooth. This is certainly a drinkable beer."
"This beer poured a brown cloudy color with a thick persistent head that cascades down the glass when tilted. The smell is malty. The taste is malty and a bit alcoholic. The aftertaste is slightly sweet like caramel. The mouthfeel is thick and bright. This is a delicious beer that should be consumed whenever possible."
"I'll have another... and @ $4.75 a pop?... maybe I'll wait a while..."
"bit of frothy head and a whole lot of lacing. This is one of the finest beers I have ever drank."
"Drinkability is high. The richness, high carbonation, and alcohol burn make it a sipper, but I'll keep sipping."
"Overall, this is a very drinkable brew and excellent Belgian strong dark ale. Personally, I prefer the complexities of the quad."
"This is another case where I think aging will do a whole lot of good. In the meantime, I'll give Rochefort the benefit of the doubt given their clear potential as evidenced by the Rochefort 10."
"A dangerously drinkable strong beer. There's a ton of flavor but it's not at all heavy like the 10 which I feel compelled to sip (and love). This you could conceivably down quickly. Yummy!"
"Finish is somewhat sour and reminds me of burnt apples. Can I just nose the beer? Is that permitted?"
"I thought this would be a great ale for tailgating to a college football game with a mix of cheeses and heros as it could be served to anyone easily."
"Admitedly, this style is not my bag, however this ale goes down super-smooth!"
"overall I enjoyed this beer very much and would seek it out again."
"Poured into a tulip glass. The body is a cloudy dark brown color with a big beige head that recedes quickly down to just a skim on top. Leaves a nice amount of lacing. Smells of spice, sweet fruit and roasted malts. Also a hint of alcohol in the nose. Tastes like it smells - sweet dark fruits, some spice, and roasted malts with a little bit of warming alcohol at the end. A very rich and complex beer but also very smooth and balanced. All the different flavors come together perfectly making this a very good beer."
"Poured from an 11.2oz bottle into an oversized wine glass. Slow pour still produced a full two finger beige head that slowly gave way so moderate sticky lacing. Appearance is an opaque mocha colored brown with a slight reddish tint to it in the light and nearing the edges. Aroma smells sweetly of malt, dried fruit, warm sugary alcohol and has a yeastiness about it. The alcohol is far from hidden in the nose as it makes itself known in both the nose and in the finish. Taste starts sweet and rich of dried dark fruits, then nicely progesses towards a stronger yeast flavor than first introduced in the nostrils. This brew is able to keep one guessing when the alchol will emerge from the sweet earthiness and bite as it tends to fade and reapppear with passing sips. One sweet and seemingly innocent and then the next you might think you're dealing with far higher than 9.2% abv. Mouthfeel is medium body with an aptly paired moderate carbonation, slight roughing of the tongue as it then washes off towards the gullet with a more smoothing feeling. Finishes with a sweet dryness in the mouth, much like a dark espresso, alongside a minimal sweet fruity aftertaste. Drinkability is scored a little lesser given the seeming omnipresence of alcohol in this ale, either way, overall an enjoyable ale."
"It all went down with a creamy smoothness and a nice finish despite the high ABV. I tasted this without any food, but I suspect it would be incredible with a grilled steak. I'm looking forward to unravelling its mysteries with future tastings!"
"Taste is rounded molasses and candy sugar. Faint ginger. Black currant and plum. Alcohol is very apparent in the finish and keeps the mouth drier than expected. Medium bodied, feels sticky at first and then the alcohol just dries it the hell out. A sipper and a good beer in its own right, not just as the 10's little brother. This beer screams for steak. And more than six-months aging."
"Overall, this beer was a disappointment."
"Poured out of it's 11.2 oz bottle into a chalice. Quickly dissapearing white head forms on top of a murky dark brown body. Smell is fruity with bananas, pears, dough and sweet malt with a noticable strong alcohol presence in the nose as well. Mouthfeel is rather light and highly carbonated. Taste is absolutely incredible! Taste is dry with fruity notes, spices and chocolate that is followed by a long warming alcohol presence. High alcohol character hurts the drinkability a bit. As the beer warms up it gets even better. Overall, this is simply a sensational brew."
"Pours a medium brown with slightly cloudy amber accents. Light tan head that sticks to the glass and refuses to leave the beer. Aromas of phenols, yeast, and some figgy fruits. Coffee, vanilla-rum and chocolate notes are laid over some light hops (styrian goldings?). On the palate, fruity (figgy) sweetness up front and throughout, along with rich yeast and mild alcoholic burn. The fruitiness is surprisingly scant. Aside from the alcohol burn, the mouthfeel is only medium-bodied, but very smooth on the palate. This is an excellent dubbel... a little stronger than usual, but wonderful flavors and good mouthfeel more than make up for that."
"Most definitely a sipping beer, one that needs to be slowly savored."
"Final thoughts: This is a fine beer, but it's certainly a sipper. Points off for the overwhelming alcoholic presence... I prefer my beers a bit more subtle. Everlasting head. Despite the high alcoholic content, I expected this to be more warming and, well, inebriating. Odd. Definitely a brew seeking out if youre a fan of Belgian darks."
"love the spicy alcohol burn play with the malty fruit tones. this is a slendid belgian trappist concoction."
"Mouthfeel- Very clear, almost sunny comes to mind as an adjective to decribe this beer. Almost reffreshing too for a beer with such a high abv. Very malty, but with lots of other nuances to divert your attention away from just the malts."
"Very strong molasses taste. Fruit esters with strong warming alcohol burn. though it does go down smooth, and finshes rather clean, only leaving a slight bitterness lingering in the back of the palette."
"I sat in sipping this one slowly and really savoring it. As it warms up, boy does the taste get big. Kinda reminds me of how a tube amp takes a while to hit it's sweet spot... I loved the mouthfeel on this one and found it very easy to drink. I will pick up two bottles of this and leave the ten for someone who may appreciate it more than me..."
"I like this, but not as much as the Chimay blue, which I had just recently. I will revist this later, maybe a side by side is in order. This was very good, but also expensive."
"This lived up to the hype for me. Not one of my favorites, but a very solid, enjoyable Belgian nonetheless."
"D: I drank this a little too fast. The 9% abv is not very apparent, and the taste is very nicely balanced. Will drink again and again."
"Trappistes Rochefort 8 pours a dark mahogany color with an off white head from a brown 33cl bottle. Aroma has mild hints of banana, clove and dark fruit. Alcohol also seems apparent from the aroma. Taste definitely has some dark fruit flavors. Estery. Alcohol is noticeable in the finish. Recommended."
"A fantastic brew. All around balanced flavor and aroma, with a nice appearance. A good choice on a nice rainy day. I would enjoy this a lot with a hearty meal, something like pot pie or shepard's pie."
"Overall, a very nice, very complex brew, damaged only slightly by a somewhat too aggressive mouthfeel. Recommended with meats, cheeses, or low-sugar chocolates. A bit sweet for anything but the very dark chocolates."
"Edit 11/26/06: Opened up a fresher bottle next to a Westy 8. The Westy barely edged it out IMO but this one is just so nice and complex that it's hard live up to something like that. I found the Westy to just be a bit more smooth. Pricewise??? C'mon, there's no need to argue. I think I paid $4.50 for this bottle and I think the Westy was $18."
"A very nice beer, though I think I prefer the 10 in the end. This one is very sensitive to temperature. If it is a touch too cold it is quite disappointing."
"Bottom line: A very tasty brew of its style that I can thoroughly recommend!"
"Finally, this ale had a hint toasty toffee/caramel with layers of soft malts and hops. A very nice beer without being heavy. Extremely well-ballanced."
"Drinkability is much better than expected. I could sit and sip this all night, and every sip brings something new."
"Great beer, has improved greatly with age since this batch was purchased. At this age I do prefer the 6 or 10 better though."
"I finished this glass in no time. If it wasn't for the price, I could pound back quite a few of these in one night, but at nearly 10% I'm not so sure that'd be a great idea."
"For some reason this does not seem to be the same beer, I tasted a couple of years ago. This beer used to have a little more body and was more outspoken. Nevertheless a good beer!"
"D - Too easy to drink. Alcohol is pretty much nowhere to be seen and a very moreish sipper. I'd rate the 10 as just a shade better, but both are absolutely superb beers."
"Taste; good malty sweetness with hints of chocolate and molasses, with a little bit of candied sugar. The fruits become more pronounced once this warms, with prunes, figs, apples and some apricots. This finishes with a bit of a peppery spiciness, and a touch of alcohol. Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied, and very easy to drink."
"Note: yeast pour doesn't affect the taste much and adds slightly to the body. I recommend pouring it in immediately."
"Glad this beer made its way down to Texas, and glad I finally decided to pick one up."
"An exceptional example of my favorite style. Pours a dark chestnut with glints of ruby. The off-white head is perfect - not small, not overly large. Aroma is immediately of bready yeast and ripe, dark fruit. Plum, caramel, perhaps some banana bread are evident in the taste, with maybe some dark grapes. The taste grows more complex as the ale warms, bringing out flavors too numerous to begin to describe. As far as mouthfeel, the phenolic oilyness makes a perfectly smooth balance to the ample carbonation. Excellent ale. Very drinkable, except that more than a few pints of this will leave you on the floor."
"Not quite the powerhouse that Rochefort 10 is, but there's still very little to complain about here."
"Drinkability- Was a bit disappointed, but it's still above average. I would buy several others over this one, but would in no way, shape or form, turn one down if offered to me. For the $5 I paid for it though, seems like I was a bit let down."
"Overall, a fine beer worthy of it's pedigree. While BSDA's aren't my favorite style, I do recognize the excellence and craftsmanship exhibited in brewing this beer. Quite nice."
" Overall, damned good. I could see myself sipping a few of these around a roaring campfire. Excellent as a mellow nightcap. The complexity is something to be enjoyed."
"Pours large, lasting head, slowly giving way to layers of lace. Hazy dark ruby/brown. Forward, sweet aroma, predominantly anise & molasses. Also shows sassafrass/earth, candied orange, raisin, and some alcohol as it warms. Flavor is complex malt. Rich, robust licorice/maple/molasses. Malt balanced with dark candi sugar, smooth, even, and lasting. Flavors and aromas mature as it warms in the glass. Fantastic. Cant (afford to) drink enough."
"I think I prefer the 8 to the 10. The 10 favors the alcohol to the point where it's a little too obtrusive, while the 8 has deep and satisfying flavors while masking the alcohol. For such a high ABV beer, this is supremely drinkable. World class stuff."
"This is my second Rochefort with my first being the ""6". They seem to be very different tastes IIRC."
"This beer pours a dark brown with a slight reddish tint. A lovely creamy off-white head sits atop the body. Head gradually settles down to a thin coating across the surface of the beer that lasted as long as the beer did. Nice lacing, even in a tulip. Aroma is caramel, chocolate, cookies, some berries and dark fruit. Mostly sweet nose, but some roasted notes. Slight aroma of alcohol as well. Initial flavor is moderately sweet, cookie dough, milk chocolate, caramel, toffee, candi sugar, figs, and raisins. The flavors compliment each other quite well and are very balanced. The beer ends with warming alcohol, and a medium length, dry finish. This has an incredible mouthfeel, round, filling, very smooth and creamy. Lively carbonation dances on the tongue. Wonderfully complex, but without the hot alcohol that ruins the 10."
"Overall: Wonderful. If it weren't so pricey, I could make this my regular."
"P.S. after writing the review above, I shook the residual yeast sediment and mix it into the beer. The smell gets dense and intensively perfumy with lots of esters. The palate gets a sharp, licorice and woody yeasty edge, and the whole experience turns more pleasant~~ though I also start to feel a bit dizzy, due to the yeasts..."
"A pretty solid Belgian, I'd sample it again at a later date, but not as spectacular as all the hype has built it up to be."
"This pours a dark cloudy orange brown with a giant tan foamy head. The smell has a citrus hoppy aroma with yeast and dark fruit scents. The taste is dark fruit, citrus fruit, Belgian yeast,and a strong alcohol flavor. The m/f is medium with a balance of flavors thats perfect. This is an outstanding beer that shouldn't be missed."
"Cheers2Beers"
"This poured out into my chalice a touch lighter than the 10, showing more ruby and brownish deep red hues. Light purple in some light. The head is a fine layer of bone-white foam, consistent and solid, leaving screens of lacing. The aroma follows the pattern of the 10. The difference is more sourish dark malts here, pronounced more under less alcohol than the 10. The 8 seems a little more spicy as well, prehaps cinnamon or tree bark. Big hits of phenol and alcohol from the 9.2%, and light hints of ground coffee and dark bready malting. All the dark fruits are here, though less noticeable than in the 10. There are some leafy green smells in here too: celery, lettuce and roasted green pepper. Hits of charcoal above the rim. The aroma is always creamy and a bit lactosy with a sweetness akin to raisins. A complex aroma, though not quite on par with the 10 for sheer variety of aroma. Woody tastes at first in the mouth, followed by a big hit of warmth from the alcohol and intense spiciness combined. The finish is very malty and bready, like a handful of barley. There is a perfumey character to the whole taste, as well as a spritzy hair-spray bitterness from the alcohol. Some sourish malts at first too, and the best of the beer's taste is on the middle of the tongue, where the sweet malts combine with a delicate carbonation and a little bitterness. A bit of saltiness in the aftertaste, and very strong grainy/woody tastes. The carbonation seems a little higher than the 10. The beer warms the innards quickly and nicely. Full-bodied, though not extremely thick in the mouth. The 9.2% is masked well and this presents an extremely drinkable strong Belgian dark ale. Fantastic, but not quite as inspiring as the 10 for me."
"You definitely sip this beer; no, you partake in this beer. A few are more than enough. The alcohol could mess with your ability to truly enjoy all facets of this beer after 2 or 3. This is simply one of the best, if not the best Belgian Strong Darks I've ever had."
"Overall: Simply too complex for me; give it a try yourself and see."
"This is among my favorite beers to date. Drinking this was an absolute experience."
"The Swedish monopoly store Systembolaget just started to sell Rochefort 8 and 10 in April, 2006. All the 10s was sold out before lunch so I had to be content with 8. Well, it wasn't a ""down-buy"" as we say in Sweden. It poured with a generous and creamy latte colored foam. The color was dark, nutbrown and the smell sweet and fruity. I found the taste a little surprising since it tasted of licorice. Although there was no alco taste it was definately chest warming. Great mouthfeel. Actually, I found it pretty similar to Traquair's Jacobite."
"This beer is very complex. Lots going here, but perhaps a little too sweet. Very good, even better when cellared. Try it if you can get your hands on it. Watch out for that ABV though, it can kick you in the butt if you aren't carefull."
"Pours a cloudy ice tea color while unleashing a huge, dense head. Aroma is of candy sugar, fruit peel and pears. This brew glides in harmony with the palate. Super smooth and silky yet very active in carbonation to give the body some attack. Taste begins with banana and other fruit tinges while spicy notes lend balance to the fruit wave. Alcohol presence weaves in and out lending the spice note, but it is never intrusive. This is top notch stuff. Definitely something to sip and savor."
"Mouthfeel is medium, crisp and well-carbonated. Good, but lacks the greatness of its #10 cousin."
"Opinion: Man, now this is a good beer! My wife isn't really a beer drinker, but I gave her a sample of the Rochefort 10, and she exclaimed ""How can anyone not like this beer!?"" I agree, and think that this statement describes this beer...excellent! I tell you now that I will drink this beer any chance I get until I am stinking drink. This (and the 10 especially) are phenomenal beers and one that you absolutely HAVE to try!"
"A beautiful color of forest fire in Fall. Pleasing aroma of berries, fruitcake, brandy soaked malts (But not fully, just partially) along with a touch of banana. Chewy malt profile with notes of sweetened dark fruits (plums, grapes), along with a hint of chocolate and toffee. A lovely beer overall. This was my staple, my session beer while I was in Belgium and at 2 Euros a bottle can you blame me?"
"Notes: this is one well rounded brew with incredible complexity. You could throw in a ton of adverbs to describe this and I don't think one could argue much with ya."
"D: It is very complex, and I enjoyed it. I will definitely buy some more. However with the high ABV, I'm not sure how many of these I could drink in a night."
"D - Okay. It isn't quite the aromatic kick in the face that is the 10, it is enjoyable, but highly overrated. Unsessionable. I had it with some lime and pepper perch and haddock. The Rochefort brews are easily the most overrated on the market."
"D: Both the Rochefort 8 and 10 are , in my opinion, overpriced and overhyped. I've had beers that are 50% cheaper than these that I would rather drink. I don't see myself trying these beers again."
"Overall: Pretty good, but I feel the drinkability of this beer was negatively affected by its carbonation level."
"My local shop has plenty on the shelf, lucky me!"
"I must say, I totally love this beer. Very refreshing, and a joy to drink. I can see why most people rate this style of beer so high. Looking foward to trying the Rochefort 10."
"Poured into a Rapscallion glass, formed a 1"" beige head above the clear reddish burgundy brew. Pillowy head is not going anywhere, period, and lacing consists of heavy foam bits all over the place. Aroma is spicy yeasts with an undercurrent of malt sweetness. Taste is what the nose indicated, but with more balance between the grain and spiciness, and a lingering flavor of same following swallow. Mouthfeel is creamy smooth, and drinkability is excellent, especially for the abv. This one lives up to the hype."
"Very drinkable. Will definitely buy again."
"D: Why is Rochefort so good?? So complex. I would love to drink this all night. I almost recommend the 8 as much as the 10, and that is saying something. Buy it if you see it."
"This one is a pleasure. Deeper flavors than I would've expected, for a Belgian ale that is powdery and slightly thin."
"World-class beer!"
"Brown sugar, vanilla, fruity, malty, and, rich scents. tastes of brown sugar, cinamon, raisins, chocolate, and spices. very sweet rich drink. It would be good to drink with a dessert. the carbonation is alright and the mouthfeel is malty/slightly coarse which isnt bad at all. I like this beer a lot. definitely something that everyone should try. Not a Rochefort Ten, but damn good."
"Review #900 by the way only 100 to #1000."
"Pours a dark brown with deep amber hues. Cap was huge right off and had to let settle a little to finish pouring. Cap is tan that leaves very nice lacings along sides of glass and created caverns as it fell. Smell is very potent with lots of fruity maltiness and brown sugar. Figs and raisins. Alcohol is very evident in nose. Reminds of a port. Alcohol taste is very evident just like the nose. Taste is very sweet with lots of fruit and like a rum ball or spiced cake. Hops has a mildly bitter finish to help mellow the sweetness and tone down the alcohol. Body is medium with a crisp amount of carbonation. It finishes a little on the dry side but leaving lots of flavor lingering. I will have again!"
"Ppoured a crimson almost brown ale with a thick rocky, tan head that stayed around for a long time a left ample lace on my Chimay Chalice. The aroma is sweet and full of dark fruits with a touch of spice, reminds me of a malty sweet holiday fruitcake. The flavor is very malt oriented and it has a strong malty sweetness in the beginning that is balanced by a light, yet noticeable, clean spicy hop bitterness and a toasty malt flavor. It segues into a fruitier drier malt flavor towards the end and it finishes with a balanced sweet/toasty malt flavor and a bit of hop bitterness to lend it a clean quality. It has a noticable alcohol level and it warms the belly nicely. This ale would be very drinkable if it was milder yet that would make it boring so I think for what it is it's drinkabilty is as high as you can get with this high of alcohol level and flavor."
"11.2 ounce bottle ($5.99 ouch!), with some sort of dating(?) that I can make no sense of. Pours muddy medium brown, with a long lasting tan head and leaving moderate lacing. Nose is mildly of cola and brandy. This is a full flavored brew, lots more cola flavors as well as figs and brandy. Cant say this is my favorite, I recognize the quality and intensity of this creation, just too much cola sweetness going on here. Worth trying this quality brew, but drinkability is not super high, IMHO"
"This was a treat."
"Mothfeel is incredibly smooth, malty and fizzy. Definite alcohol warmth is noticeable."
"Overall it was a great beer. Not my favorite style and I admit I know very little so far of this style but this is one of the better examples I have had. I would give it another tasting."
"Drinkablility I'd say is high, it hides the alcohol fairly well, and is quite well balanced."
"Taste was about the same as the smell, but the citrus was lost and replaced with vanilla hints. Good feel to it, enough tingles to wake up the buds."
"I'm finding that Belgian Strongs typically have pretty interesting, layered aromas. This entry from Rochefort is not bad, but also not perfect."
"Very drinkable. The alcohol, while present, does not detract from the flavor. It is a bit filling, but still one of the best I've ever had."
"Poured into a wide-mouth goblet from a 33cl bottle. Appeared as a slightly hazy brown color with a light cocoa head and inticate lacing. Nose is wildly exciting with alcohol up front, a good rum perhaps. Banana, raisin, and tropical fruit notes are also asserting themselves here. Velvety taste, as the alcohol retreats in the beginning. Meduim-bodied malt character, slightly exotic and spicy. Again, spiced rum comes to mind. Some sweet darkchocolate flavors erupt as well ... blended with the fruitiness of the malt/yeast chemistry. Alcohol is assertive throughout, with a medium, to heavy mouthfeel. Sweeter than dryer finish. Little carbonation. In every respect, a great beer. Very, very complex flavor profile. and the smell is epic. One of the best for sure, and one that needs to be in every beer lovers adventures. I prefer drinking this one alone ... that is, without the accompaniment of any food. Fine to drink with other beer lovers!"
"This is a potent brew with obvious alcohol taste and effects. Very filling. One in a sitting will do for me, but this is a beer that deserves being revisited for another great drinking experience. $6 a bottle is the limiting factor."
"Drinkability: This is one sexy beast. A great combination of melded and unmelded taste and smells. The alcohol is well covered up in the drinking. The only way I knew the alcohol was there was that consistant warming sensation."
"Some thiness on drinking, and flavours that are too quickly overwhelmed by the alcohol. Good, but needs polish."
"flavor is surprisingly weak. as a huge fan of the 10, this is a bit of a shock; flavor is astringent, bitter, and oddly empty. bit of a sweet aftertaste; a bready brown sugar flavor. sharp carbonation gives it a soda-like mouthfeel. i'm hitting the bottom of the glass and finding little else to note. oddly enough, i prefer the 6 and the 10 to this one."
"Pours nicely and then the head falls into a nice lacing with a good, creamy head. An extremely dark to amber color tones. A light scent of very sweet and hoppy Belgium ale that smells carbonated and warms you up right away. The hoppiness is very noticeable and balances well, it has a very light orange undertone with a super slight coffee smell after it leaves the tongue, and it becomes more prominant as it warms. The sweetness and hops aren't only blended well, but the pepper really supports the flavor well."
"The moderately decent flavor, combined with the high alcohol leads to a low drinkability for me. I may try this again in a year or two when my tastes may have changed, but for now there are better ways to spend the six bucks or so I spent on this 11.2 oz bottle. I can't believe this beer is as highly-rated as it is."
"wonderful deep rich brown color, poured with an inviting off white head. Sweet aroma, intense sweetness, caramel, dried cherries.This beer is big in the mouth, nice mouthfeel, the alcohol is there but it doesent overpower the sweet malty goodness. I love the balance of this beer, the alcohol, almost like a sweet vapor as you indulge in a complex mix of raisins, burnt sugar, toffee and even slight hints of coffee. This is a great beer."
"For a beer with 9.2% this is a highly drinkable beer. It is a smooth, complex gem."
"Overall: I think I got this on a pricing error for two bucks a bottle, which is a fantastic deal. It's a good example of the style, but maybe not worth the huge premium it usually commands."
"I love this beer. With such a great flavor you can't go wrong with it. Nothing bad I can say... well worth the 7 bucks..."
"The perfect releif from all of the bad beers that I've drank lately. After passing on this beer for my entire life, I finally got arround to nailing it. Now, I feel stupid for not doing it sooner. The beer is nearly flawless. A muddles brown hue promises thickness, fullness, and complexity. Lightly carbonated and with a firm foamstand. Aromas show dried dark fruits, muskiness, tartness,and a hint of chocolate. Flavors don't disapoint. Dehydrated fruits form pineapples to dates and figs. Rich chocolate and malts meld together, showing firm alcohols throughout (kinda like a bourbon ball). Heavy sweetness is balanced with tartness and woodsyness. Full and rich, yet heavily drinkable on the palate and down the throat. Mouthwatering down to the last sip. Only the alcohols become a little phenolic. Otherwise, flawless."
"Had the bottled version of this beer in a beer tasting event. This beer has a thick cloudy deep brown color with a thick even light brown head and good lacing. The smell is rich with fermented fruit and leather. The taste, like the 10, is still lighter than I would expect, but better than the 10. The taste, although light, is of nuts and fruits and a bit of tannin. It has all the tags to be a great beer but it lacks a full flavor. It is better than the 10, Im looking forward to drinking a 6 for the final comparison."
"Put me down as one craft beer drinker who is unimpressed with Rochefort ales. I think they are well made and have some interesting distinctive features but they are overrated. If I want this type of stiff drink which I have to eat food with or else 3 or 4 on an empty stomach are trouble, I'll do the job better with a rum drink or a sherry."
"This brew pours into a chalice with a nice foamy tan head. The color is a dark brown almost opaque. The aroma is alcohol soaked raisins and plums, dark chocolate, candy sugar, and pumpernickle bread. The taste comes through as a chocolate, malty sweet delight. The flavor is much the same in profile to many of the big Beligum brews, but this one is the best IMO! The body is filling; not enough to fill you up though. I could drink this one everyday but, probably no more than two."
"Pours a dark hazy brown, with a tan head. Smells strongly of purple-flavoured candy. A bit of yeast rounds out the nose. Fruity taste, with a strong alcoholic bite. A little bit of hops in the finish, but they're not the centerpiece of the flavours. There's a darker taste to it, but more fruity than roasty. Feels a bit overcarbonated ever so slightly, but is very drinkable nonetheless. Not my choice for something to drink everyday, but very tasty."
"Beautiful pour, thick head that remains throughout entire glass with noticeable lacing. Dark brown in color. Slightly sweet taste of raisin and plums. Very easy drinking for such a high alcohol content. Drinks much smoother than it looks. Wonderful beer that only improves with time if you have the self-discipline."
"Overall - An exceptional beer.... Highly recommended..."
"Rochefort 8 pours well with a nice medium head that stands long after poured. The rich, dark amber color is ever present along with smells of caramel and raisens. The alcohol content while high is very discreet and I could see myself getting in trouble drinking this quality Belgian ale. The best beer I have had in awhile."
"D- This beer taste very fresh and the flavors are more distinct and have not blended together. It has lots of good flavors but the alcohol and fizz are a bit strong."
"Drinkability: A bit lighter in body than most BSDAs, a nonetheless satisfying sipper"
"An excellent trappist beer, the bottle I had was approximately a year old so the beer did have suffecient time to age a little bit without becoming oxidized. To steal a partial quote from Tim Webb, it is a potent warming cosmic meltdown of a forcefully contemplative brew. Color was a nice deep brown, had a fair amount of sediment in the bottle. Carbonation was still good. This is a world class beer and one of my favorites amongst the trappists. Not as sweet or as big as the 10 but very very drinkable."
"This is a balanced and complex beer, and surprisingly drinkable for the high abv. Delicious."
"Drinkability: An excellent beer, I enjoyed it about as much as the 10."
"Overall drinkability is very good. This is a very well-made beer, if not a bit sweet to drink too much of. An excellent dessert beer."
"Overall: I feel like I am missing something when I drink this. I guess that being a newcomer to beer may explain this but while I recognize that this beer is very good I can't say it has stood out for me."
"My first taste of a true trappist and I am not dissapointed. If it was only a little more afordable I would drink all the time. A great treat to have once in a while. If you have not tried this, what are you waiting for? Search it out and try it. Can't wait to try the 10 in the cellar."
"Quite a nice pour, dark brown, almost as dark as a cola with very strong head retention, head stayed thick and puffy for a few minutes. Smell is interesting but very good, hints of bubblegum and mint. Taste is equally as interesting, Earthy, grassy tones with a slightly bitter finish. Alcohol not very prevalent in this brew which makes it easy on the mouth, and not difficult to drink at all. Carbonation is not excessive at all, this is a nice brew, looking forward to more of these in the future."
"330ml bottle Pours abrown almost like coke. A good tan head which is fizzy and deminishing leaving no lacing. Has a malty chocolate aroma. Taste is sweet and sour, very differnt but excellent. Fizzy carbonation with the texture of a fine wine.Sort of sour aftertaste. This is very good with a taste explosion. I feel like I could drink 100""s of them and never get bored with it."
"Carbonation is well done; this is not bubbly or fizzy but does not come off as an oil slick. Overall a great Belgian beer. I continuously question myself as to why I've ignored Belgian beers in the past."
"I don't want to stop drinking this. Why did I only buy only one bottle? Oh yeah, because they're $7.... Bummer... What a treat!"
"Pours a reddish brown color with a smaller head than I expect. It diminishes fairly quickly. Smell is sour cherries with some floral notes. There is also a good amount of maltiness in the aroma and on the palate too. Taste is somewhat vinous at first but finishes with a good heat. There is a nice standard Belgian effervescence as would be expected. It is a nice beer but I think this sample is not as fresh (or good) as the last one I tried."
"Poured into a John's Grocery chalice. Pours a deep dark brown, with about an inch of fluffy head. Smell, from chocolate to dark fruits, figs and raisins are just two of the flavors you can expect to find. Taste is malty and sweet with hints of dark fruit, alcohol is wearing a camouflaged suit, very deceptive. Mouthfeel has room for improvement, it is a little light. Drinkability, I would definitely have a few of these in a night, if I had a fatter wallet."
"Overall a very tasty trapist ale, not the greatest, but basically decent. The carbonation really overpowered the taste."
"Delightfully complex, but not overbearing. Printed on the label are the characters L 29 06 10 followed by 07:43 below."
"Fruitier, and not as much chocolate flavour as the Rochefort 6... à chacun, son goût!"
"The is a malty, infinitely complex beer. Truly a beer to be sipped and savoured. Its better than I expected. Even better then the 10 to me."
"Mark"
"Pours amber in color with big bubbles and a head that falls quickly to a single bubble sustaining film. Wow, this smells exactly like a port. Theres some big fig smell with some white raison and tootsie roll. My mind is telling me that theres alcohol here, but its wonderfully camouflaged. Tastes like some sort of divine dopplebock. Theres a cola like caramel, some prunes and a nice lime finish. There are also a few slight spices mixed in here. Really warmed up my stomach too. The mouth feel was a big disappointment. The carbonation kept stealing the flavor, so frustration is giving this a lower rating. This is a very nice beer."
"Pretty good, but Ill have to revisit in the future."
"If you have not tried this, get it as soon as possible, have it after dinner in a Trappist chalice, sip, drink deep, whatever. You will not be disappointed."
"this beer deserves much less thinkin and much more drinkin...Im off."
"330 ml bottle, served just below cellar temperature in a chalice. Pours a deep garnet/brown with a 2 finger tan head of variable sized bubbles, looking pillowy soft while subsiding to a half inch of very fine foam that leaves lots of beautiful lacing. Smells fruity sweet - like a fruit roll-up (black cherries?, currants?). Tastes very much the same but with notes of alcohol and medicinal phenols, anise, chocolate, some hops and hop bitterness, caramel?, melons?, apples?. A lot of guesswork on this beer - the flavors are hard to pinpoint, but they smell and taste kinda like a sweet candy. It has a body that is thick and smooth, and although it is a good beer, after the 10 I had really high expectations for their other beers or thought they might taste similar. This one's good in a different way than the 10, but still doesn't compare to it."
"The mouthfeel is very good. Perfect carbonation, smooth. Overall, this is an exceptional beer. I had this with some very good steak and BBQ'd vegies. Absolutely perfect match! Wow!"
" Taste is complex and fruity. A toasted biscuit character is also there. The hops are very understated, but they are noticed. Mouthfeel is velvety smooth. Sessionably drinkable."
"This beer positively frothed out of the bottle to form a big head topping a very deep dark brown body. The nose is subdued fruit notes and old leather. The taste is truly remarkable; complex earthy body with a dryish finish. The plummy flavours taste aged and regal. This is a beer that can stop you dead in its tracks by its bigness and complexity. Freakin brilliant."
"This is really an exceptional beer. From the first sip to the last it is very enjoyable. Great hops and a nice after taste. It leaves you craving another and another. The biggest problem was running out before I got my fill. Buy it! Drink it! If you can find it."
"D = Still a great beer. Not as complex as the 10 but a great beer none the less."
"Pours dark brown color with a hint of red. Has a nice quarter inch head. Has a mild fruity and maly smell. Mouthfeel is highly carbonated yet smooth. Taste is unbelievable. It's lightly hopped and the spices and malts are perfectly balanced. The alochol is well hidden and very deceiving. You'd never guess it's 9.2 abv. This is one spectacular beer. It's just as good as Rochefort 10. No beer drinker will want to miss this one."
"The mouthfeel of this beer is excellent. It is full bodied and fairly high in carbonation. As I have said with other Belgian Strong Dark Ales I believe that higher carbonation adds to the overall character of the beer. If there were less carbonation it might taste as if the beer were flat. The beer also leaves and oily feeling on my tongue after I have swallowed it, perhaps this is one of the reasons why the taste still lingers in my mouth for a bit (longer than most) after I have swallowed it. I would definitely buy this brew again. It is an excellent beer and is definitely one of my favorites (out of the few styles/beers I have had at this point)."
"-UF"
"This brew pours a brown color with a lot of visible floaties. The head is unimpressive. It is small and white, and disappears within seconds. I started writing this review the moment I set the glass down after I poured the beer, and the head was gone before I was finished typing the opening sentence. All that is left now is a thin ring around the edge, and a thin cirrus cloud of foam on top. Caramel, and dark fruit dominate the aroma, while spices linger in the background. It is not what I would expect from a Belgian strong dark ale, but it is not unpleasant either. The taste is quite fruity with caramel tones. Spices and alcohol don't voice themselves until the aftertaste. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with nice carbonation. Overall, this is not my favorite Belgian strong dark ale. I think that the extra fruitiness of this beer would be easier for me to like if it were spicies."
"Decent beer, but not terribly impressive."
"A complex beer. Flavors change in the mouth and as it warms. Truly enjoyable and one I will buy whenever I can. It would be great to age some."
"My first experience with Rochefort and Im thrilled. I cant wait to try the 10 thats waiting for me in the fridge."
"Pours a dark plum color with a head of fine bubbles. Looks spectac in my St. B glass. Aroma is of chocolates, plums, fruits, yumminess. Taste is big chocolate, a sweetness and fruitiness do die for and a finish that is akin to dark chocolate and a dryness that is completely unexpected. It's almost tart and vinuous. Yeah, it's dry and chocolatey and a bit sour and bittersour in the dry finish. It's complex and... I don't know. I can't tell, but it's very fascinating. No notes of spices, but it's quite spectacular. Mouthfeel is good, fine bubbles dissipating on the tongue and leaving the chocolate. Drinkability? One could kick these back all night... Excellent overall."
"Rochefort 8 is an excellent bottled beer that is probably even more divine served up on tap in the town of the monestary with the appropriate accompanying cheeses."
"if I had a choice the 10 is better but this one is damn good."
"Overall, for my 200th beer review on Beer Advocate, I finally hit a 5 on flavor! What a long strange trip it's been!!! One of the best I've had! However, don't drink more than 2, you'll be incapable of operating heavy machinery!"
"Notes: Excellent. I may have a new favorite here. Definitely one of the best beers I've ever tried. I recommend it to any fan of Belgians or fans of any dark beer in general. Enjoy!!"
"In the end this beer is definately in my top ten of beers, due a lot to the aroma and flavour. A noble beer to sip on a Sunday afternoon."
"Smells of brown sugar and dark fruits. There's a rich, sweet fig flavor that blends well with the slight warming efffect of the alcohol content. The alcohol taste never overpowers the other flavors, but it makes it's presence known through a nice belly warming. Very nice mouthfeel. Thicker than usual, but very smooth. Seems to dry out slighty as temperatures increase. Simply put, this is just a wonderful beer. One of those drink any time brews."
"Overall, not a bad beer though not quite as good as I was hoping for after trying the 10."
"A total classic and world class beer. Poured out to a cloudy hazed dark cider color that turned to an almost raspberry like color when held to the light. Thick foamy head was cream colored and about 1 inch and consistant. Rings of lace surround the interior of the glass. Aromas fo dark fruits, huts, earth and malts blend well, hinting at the flavors to soon follow. Taste was wonderful; flavors of spice, malts, dark fruit and a touch of warm alcohol mesh in a plethora of delight for the consumer. Mouthfeel was excellent; perfect carbonation balanced with superior smoothness and body. Good drinkability; this brew has got it all. Highly recommended."
"pours a deep brown with fluffy head that recedes quickly leaving very little lace. there is a pool of bubbles on top leading me to believe that it's going to be very carbonated, maybe even over carbonated. smells of musty dark fruits, brown sugar and something that almost reminds me of mud. tastes of molasses, malts, raisins, some hop bitterness in the finish. there's a sweetness from the alcohol that is very pleasant and not at all hot. this is a very good beer that i should drink much more often than i do."
"Smooth. This beer went down surprisingly smooth. Poured a dark, dark, dark amber in color. Some red light peeked around the edges. Thick foamy head that receded to a sheer veneer of bubbles. Lace coated the inside. Flavor is very malty with a quick hit of some spices that does a great job concealing the alcohol--which there is a lot of booze. But that booze is tough to pick out. Little roastiness in the middle, but there is some nice fruit (black cherries and prunes). Even a slight hint of vanilla. Mouthfeel is full bodied and a bit creamy. Very drinkable, plus it is nice that the ABV is so high but when drinking you would never realize it."
"Drinkability. This one is a sipper for sure. Goes down easy with a nice warming alcohol glow. A beer to enjoy slowly. Very good, worth seeking out."
"Rochefort 8 is an excellent sipper, perfect for sitting around at 11 in the morning and watching a Jesse James biography oh the History Channel while waiting for a job to fall into your lap. Oh, and my cat likes the way it smells--Fancy Feast beer!"
"Aroma is rising now as the beer warms. Raisins and malt... a touch of bread..."
"The colour falls somewhere between tan and cloudy copper. Powerful aromas of red licorice, alcohol, and spice. Caramel features prominently in the flavor profile, along with more licorice, wood, raisins, and other fruits. It has quite the heavy palate as well. A huge beer, yet still very drinkable."
"This beer is exceptional in just about every way. It pours a dark brown color into a snifter glass. The aroma is warm, sweet, almost sherry-like. The taste is wonderfully balanced. There is a hint of sherry, chocolate, and a fruity tart flavor. Despite it's 9.2 percent alcohol content, other than a certain warming quality, one can barely taste the alcohol. The mouthfeel is just exactly right, not too heavy and not too thin. As long as one treats it with respect(no gulping here), this is a sublime beer and one of the very best anywhere."
"Probably the best brew I've had. Pours a dark reddish color with a really big head which dissappears quickly. Lots of lacing afterwards. Scents of malts, hops, and fruits. 8 has an awesome taste the alcohol content is hidden very well. Mouthfeel is a medium body with a great after taste. This trappist brew is very drinkable. I will buy more of the 8 and get some 10's as well."
"Akwardly spills dull cold coffee colored into a Holiday Inn glass tumbler. Perhaps a bowl might have charmed more foam; I'm just happy to have glass. On the bill it's all nuts, like Iron Chef, a dozen nut dishes, black walnuts in maple over baklava over pecan logs over marzipan. A dose is creamy, sweet, a little hot, fused. I rather like it."
"This is miles ahead of even Rochefort 10. Easily the best trappist I've ever had!"
"Murky dark brown colour with a light brown head that forms a ring around the glass and leaves some lace as it settles. Light fruity aroma with sweet malt, light alcohol and a bit of yeastiness. Kind of mellow. Malty and chocolatey flavour with a dryness from the grain. Light fruitiness as well and it finishes with some alcohol warming. Again, sort of mellow. Full, round body with plenty of carbonation that gives it a bit of an airy texture. This is a great, drinkable trappist ale. Highly recommended."
"All in all a good beer."
"i prefer the richness of the other, but still very nice"
"Pours a dark brown, hazy and opaque, little bit of red is visible, small off white head and lots of lace. Smell is cherries, chocolate, molasses, apples, some toffee and a little bit of alcohol. Taste is rich chocolate, dark fruit, sweet malts, some liquorice near the end, then some more chocolate and a bit of alcohol. Mouthfeel is nice and chewy, very warming with a dry bitter finish. Very tasty."
"Presented in a 330 ml brown bottle with a best before date."
"A must try for any beer lover...Brasserie de Rochefort makes heaven in a bottle with this one."
"07 07 04 Poured dark brownish/crimson color with a thin foamy head and some nice lacing. Sweet, fruity, some alcohol as well in the aroma. Dark cherries and chocolate taste. Finished rather spicy (cinnamon) that was nicely carbonated with a moderate alcohol burn."
"The middle child in the rochefort family. This stands up next to the 10 and comes almost on par, very drinkable and so much depth"
"Trappist 8 is truely World Class! (Ranks in top 50 Best of BA list with the lowest rating of 3.95)"
"Once it warms it's quite nice, but the alcohol can be distracting."
"Reddish brown color. Huge bubbles, think head. Smell is sweet, slightly over ripe fruit and alcohol. Slight musty smell. Lightly sweet flavor. Dry, bitter aftertaste. Unexpectedly light flavor. Nothing overpowers. Notes of ripe apricot and plum, brown sugar, then a hint of burnt/roasted flavor (not exactly coffee though). Nice lacing. As the beer warmed, the blend of flavors was enhanced. Nicely complicated. Drink this one at cellar temp, not refrigerator."
"Pick up at least one of these up if you can. I have another one in the cellar. Two bottles of Rochefort 10 are waiting for me, and I'm confused at how this can get better, and I really can't wait to try it."
"Notes: It was OK and strange, but not close to my favorite Belgian..."
"Great beer but between the availability, price, and abv I don't think I can rate this as an exceptionally drinkable beer, but highly recommended."
"though this could end up on my christmas list."
"This one pours the color of a dark ice tea with an off-white head. The head was nice and fluffy but fizzled down to a ring around my glass in short time. The smell reminds me of beef bullion mixed with a sweeter candy aroma. The taste is different than what I would have thought. It seems to have a flavor that holds the had of the bullion smell I mentioned. There is also a decent alcohol presence. Not that great for a monastic brew but still good. The mouthfeel is good, give it a swish to get those lesser flavors to show themselves. It's a good beer. I think I had higher hopes for this beer."
"Pours a dark brown with hues of ruby red throughout and a big beige head that sustained well. Nose is sweet smell. It is comprised of bananas and caramel. Taste starts malty with a hint of the caramel. In mid stream the fruity flavor kicks in. Mouthfeel is very good for this style, fairlly full and creamy smooth. Overall it is an extremely drinkable beer as the high ABV is well masked."
"Wow. Smooth and creamy...I've never experienced a beer like this before. The high alcohol content is masked nicely. Only thing that would keep me from drinking more is the price."
"What an excellent brew. Pleasantly spicy and dryish, but balanced. Pours a beautiful color with a ponderous head and foamy lacing. Carbonation level is a little higher than I expected, which suits this beer wonderfully. Many layers of flavor that I'm sure others could detect better than I, but suffice to say that an entire bakery of rich, biscuit/muffin flavors can be found here. I really enjoyed this 11.2oz bottle. I opted for this rather than the 10, not sure whether I would like what Rochefort was working with. I'll probably try the 6 and 10 having sampled this."
"Bottle obtained from John's Grocery (Iowa City) in June 2005 and consumed later that same evening. Pours a two finger light brown head over a brown, slightly cloudy, liquid. Smells chocolate brown sugar, alcohol, licorice, and molasses. Tastes wet sweet and silky smooth. Rummy bread, with chocolate, licorice and a gentle alcohol presence. There is candi-sugar, but it's like I'm munching on a crystal of rock candy. Interesting. While this beer is extraordinary, it really does taste like a tamed down version of Rochefort 10. Medium thick body and mildly carbonated. Nice lacing on the inside of the glass."
"I found this one much more enjoyable than the 6... and I look forward to trying the 10, on the next special occasion when I crack open a great one."
"Pours a very dark brown with a dark tan head which diminishes to a thin layer and remains throughout. Aromas of Chocolate, raisins, brown sugar, liquorice and plums can be found. very well bodied, with a long dry finish. I was expecting a lesser version of the Rochefort 10, but the chocolate comes through stronger here and i was able to appreciate the 8 in a different way, a superbly crafted beer."
"Bottle has a drink by date of 12/28/05. Pours a dark murky brown with hues of ruby red throughout and a big beige head that dies pretty fast. Minimal amount of lacing. Big sweet smell --a mix of bananas, candied sugar, and caramel. Taste opens strong and malty, with a bit of a caramel bite, but quickly transitions into a big fruity flavor--bananas, cantelope, pumpkin, cherries. Towards the end of the beer the alcohol creeps in, but just a little. Medium bodied, this has a creamy smooth mouthfeel. Overall an excellent and tasty beer, however still a bit short of the masterpiece that is Rochefort 10."
"Conclusion: One of the best"
"Alcohol actually comes though pretty strong in the smell, on top of dark fruit flavors and a hint of chocolate. Malts don't really come through until the taste, where they are joined with another blast of dark fruit. Alcohol is also apparent but very well blended with other flavors. The mouthfeel is very rich, while the drinkability is good."
"Drinkability: Absolutely wonderful. The alcohol is strong but the earthy flavors cover it well. Very pleasant and refreshing."
"mouthfeel: light and bubbly. smooth. drinkable. a near perfect beer, comparable to the best."
"I love the 10, and this one is very good - but not nearly as good as it's big brother. Tasty for sure, good balance. Not too sweet. Fruity notes, but lighter than the 10. I had a Westy 8 after this, and the Westy was better. This is a good beer, but I can't see any reason to buy this instead of the 10. The Westy 12 and 8 are very different in character, the Rochefort 8 seems to be a less potent version of the 10."
"In the mouth, expect a congruent comparison to the nose. All that I have described, with a sweet maltiness that finishes among the best of this style. The alcohol will make its presence felt by the end of your journey, but not long before. Outstanding and recommended highly."
"Pours a dark brown, with a nice white head. Smell is sweet, floral, with some chocolate and cherry. Creamy mouthfeel and wonderful taste. I get some caramel, a sweet aftertaste. Drinkability is low because of high ABV. Went nicely with a big grilled steak. A wonderful brew from the monks I continue to admire."
"A+"
"Drinkability: Oh, yeah. A great session beer, a wonderful closer on a night's quaffing."
"But in any case, two great beers."
" Kind of a lingering tingling burn, A very peculiar finish! Some chocolate, apples, and sweet candy flavors. A nice balance and mouthfeel overal"
"This beer has been a big disappointment, given other reviews and word of mouth. I have one more waiting in the cellar, I hope it proves to be better."
"alcohol is well hidden."
"The taste hits you with a little hoppiness at first and then lots of fruit flavors and complexity. Apricots, plums, and figs come to mind. Great tasting beer. Not overwhelming at the first sip, but the more you sip it the more flavor comes out, and you appreciate what this beer is then."
"WOW! Pours a dark hazy brown color with little to no head. Smell is surprisingly pungent and like sweet apricots and malt. The taste is exceptional. The plethora of flavors all seamlessly blended together makes for a wonderful symposium of goodness. The most prevalent of the tastes is that of candied fruit, sweet and natural spices. Its really hard to explain the large amount of flavors that are coming together to make this beer, as they are so goo together it's hard to distinguish them!"
"The taste and mouthfeel are equally bold. Sweet malts paired with dry hops and a dry finish that slowley fades into warming alcohol. Very complex and satisfying."
"I realize that this is a short review, but there just wasn't anything else going on with this beer to describe. What was there was uninspiring."
"Last swigs: Sugary cocoa & vanilla. Totally hidden ABV until the warmed up finish."
"Overall, really and extraordinary beer. I wish there was a ranking for ""balance," because this one would be an easy 5. On the sweet end of the spectrum, but never crosses the line. I really can rave about this one. Like it a bit better than the 10. A must try for anyone interested in the style."
"Bravo!"
"Drinkabillity is fantastic! What an absolutly great beer, can't hardly set the glass down, has everything you want, superbly complex yet seems simply good at the same time. Perfectly balanced!"
"Overall Impression: I have to admit, since the Rochefort 10 is my only straight 5 beer (so far) I built up to this tasting for a week. Ive cut back to two meals a day (something Ive needed to do after the holidays anyway) and consumed only Belgian (or Belgian style) beers. I have to acknowledge a deep gratitude to Stonecrusher who sent this (and the Rochefort 10) godsend to my doorstep. While this beer didnt make me cry like the 10 did, it is truly a world class beer. Even my wife, who only likes Lindemans Framboise and Corona, could see the exceptional quality of this beer. Simply outstanding, I just cant recommend Rochefort beers strongly enough. Seek, buy, enjoy. I know I will."
"From the bottle, this poured a hazy, deep brown color with a thick and dense cream colored head. The nose has an up front doughy character followed quickly by a spicy touch that blends quickly with citrus hops. The taste has the spicy character immediately accented by a caramel malt. The doughy character is not present in the flavor. The hops are there, more as an accent than a distinguishable flavor of its own. This has a very layered character. Smooth, slightly oily mouth feel and a mild alcohol warming lend to a high drinakbility,"
"Great beer, very complex and long lasting. Tastes better a little warmer than out of the fridge."
"Not as good as the 10 in anyway. The fizzyness just doesn't fit the flavor. The fruity and sweet notes are rich and potent, and smell wonderful, but it's just another Belgian Dark Strong Ale that doesn't have anything too unique about. I mean I really like the stuff, but compared to the 10 it falls short."
"EXCELLENT!!! I'm not a big belgian fan...but the darker belgians tend to hit the mark for me."
"[Drink by 8/19/08]"
"Dark fruit mixes deftly with malty sweet goodness. Moderate bitterness leads to a dry finish. Raisins & figs linger on the tongue along with a hint of orange. Medium bodied, prickly robust carbonation. Masterful!"
"Very nice, somewhat cloudy brown in appearance. Good sized head,most of which remains all the way down. Wonderful aroma-almost like fresh baked cookies. Brown sugar,caramel and a few spices-cinnamon and ginger come to mind. Big malty flavor upfront-slight yeast flavors. Very bread like. Clean finish. Good body-""bright"" on the palate. Very,very drinkable-well worth finding you some. Thanks to axisjones for the sample."
"Nothing much more needs to be said, though the alcohol level is quite high to warrant a perfect drinkability score regardless of how much I'd like to give this beer a perfect 5. I do want another though, for sure. I am looking forward to the Rochefort 10 I also purchased in the same pack. I am also looking forward to buying more and starting my first cellared stash."
"The first smell is like chocolate malt with a hint of alcohol. The initial taste hits me immediately with an alcohol then quickly fads into a very nice roasted malt flavor. It finishes with a fruity, almost cherry aftertaste. The aftertaste is a little thin and that would be my only disappointment. The lingering flavor is a yeasty, fruit flavor. Very nice beer with a medium mouth feel and carbonation. I would say this is one of the great beers in world, not the best, but up there."
"Alcohol well hidden. Nice complexity. A very good beer. My only wish would be that it be a little more robust."
"Wow! Excellent trappist ale. A couple of these on an empty stomach would do you in just fine. Deep brown color, great head, no belgian lace....belgian CURTAIN! Nice full mouthfeel. Alcohol is easily perceived upon smelling the beer. The first sip reveals an enjoyable roasted character."
"The drinkability is perfect for what this was designed for which is a refreshing beverage. Not a session beer but quite an apealing change up."
"Tastes like it smell, but a wee bit sour. Very full mouthfeel. lots of sweet, fruity notes (mainly banana and pear). A delight on my palate! Finish is long and warming. This is a good beer to try!"
"Overall, excellent beer here, one of the best I've had yet. Although it's quite expensive, I'm definitely trying this one again. Although next time, I'm going to use the proper glass..."
"Still a truly excellent brew. The 2nd best I've ever tried."
"This fine brew pours into my chalice a murky brown color with frothy head and chunky yeast sediment. The smell is like malt with yeasty fruit. The taste is slightly sweet up front followed by a bitter-tart taste of apples and grape skin with a metallic zing. All of this is delivered with a smooth but fairly thin mouthfeel with vibrant carbonation and warm alcohol. Overall a nice satisfying ale, but lacking some depth of flavor that I was hoping for."
"Very drinkable. Dangerously so for a 9.2% beer."
"This poured out a murky opaque brown with a tan foamy head that filled the goblet. The head stayed afloat for a while decorating the glass with rings of clumpy lace. The aroma is sweet and malty with a good amount of fruitiness to it and a touch of alcohol as it warmed. Caramel covered fruit was the main ingredient in the taste. There was a bit of yeastiness to it as well as a slight spiciness. Aftertaste was a sweet malt and spicy mix. Body was medium to full with a creamy smooth feel to it. Pretty drinkable stuff but the sweetness would keep me from having more than one. Good overall beer that I would pick up again."
"Mouthfeel was so soft and smooth. You want to savor every sip for this beer. I'll have to revisit this during the holiday time, the spiciness is pretty good."
"33 cl bottle. Code on botttle 28 12 05. The real winner to this beer is the ability to restrain the alcohol and still make a well balanced beer. The alcohol warming after consumption was still on the lower side and the beer was highly drinkable for the level of alcohol it contained."
"A very nice beer to kick off my birthday night."
"Had this after the 10, in many ways I actually like the 8 better. As all three Rocheforts use the same recipe, the appearance is about the same, beautiful, burgandy-brown with a tan head that laces and never completely goes away. The smell has a little more plum and less of the hint of alcohol the 10 has. The taste is almost the same, with that same incredible finish and smoothness that I will love forever like a long lost lover. I find the 8 a little less decadent and more drinkable. I somehow knew that I would love Rocheforts, and all that is left on my quest is the Westies..."
"Notes: I enjoyed this very much. From what I've heard about the 10, which I was unable to get a hold of, I will probably like that one a lot better, but this was good. Really very complex, but I thought the flavors were all too subtle."
"Certainly not a session beer, unless it's a short session. Very drinkable, but one at a time. Singular, complex, delicious."
"Definitely on par with the Rochefort 10 and very close to the Chimay Grande Réserve (Blue Cap/Label) wich I still like little better than this one. Nonetheless, ... a world-class beer!"
"Smell starts with a lot of maltarome, slightly roast followed by some fruit and a little hops. Taste is slightly roasted but mostly fruity and a nice bitterness follows afterwards. The aftertaste is mostly straw but pleasant. A good beer that doesn't taste to much alcohollike, like I would expect for a 9,2% beer."
"Poured a dark, murky, brown like really cloudy tea. Nice thick slightly off-white head with a nice sticky lacing. Very attractive. The smell was quite strong of yeast and spice. Like a very faint clove/nutmeg spice. The taste was very good with plenty of the same spice in the smell, some caramel and a very slightly noticeable cooked fruit taste in the background of the finish. The mouth feel is awsome on this one! Very smooth. Heavy, but smooth and with a nice warming effect from the 9.2%abv. Not overpowering at all, but you certainly know what kind of brew you're dealing with. I really enjoied this one and to tell the truth, I think I liked this one better than I liked the #10."
"A great well-rounded beer with world-class qualities."
"Wonderful head, perfectly dense and creamy, lasting on the dark mahogany color body. The smell is very enjoyable: yeasty with notes of pineapples, mangos and red fruits. Slightly nutty too, with pleasant notes of chocolate. The taste is great: red fruits with some exotic notes and smooth an creamy dark chocolate flavor. The thickness of the hops appears in the aftertaste but in a great harmony with the other elements of this great brew. The alcohol is superbly hidden. The mouthfeel is very rich and bready, nicely smooth and round. Such a good beer."
"Paid $5.99/bottle. Solid opaque brown. Dark tan head. Molasses and rushes of spice, alcohol and fruit behind oppressing malt. Good beer, very ""Trappist"" in style and taste - kind of overpowering and strong. I can imagine what 10 must be like. For the price I would not buy this again, but it is a good brew."
"The beer pours a nice dark brown color with a huge 2 finger latte-colored head that doesn't fall much at all. The nose is more sweet than other beers of this style that I have tried. There are some fig scents in there, but the sweetness of the malt is what prevails. After letting the beer sit, the head has fallen just a bit leaving a thick lace on the side of the glass. The alcohol is not hidden well in the initial sips, and this is not a flavor I like to have shining through in my stronger beers. As I let the beer sit and warm, the alcohol subsides and becomes more what I like. The fig and malt sweetness are there, but not overly powerful. This is not my favorite in the style, but still a good offering. The beer is a little thinner in my mouth than I like, but it's still good. The drinkablilty suffers due to the thinness and lighter flavors of this beer, but it would not be a far stretch to sit down to a few of them in a night. I would drink this beer again, but there are a few other Belgians I would pick first."
"I bought this case to the tune of $140 about a year ago. I'm sure it sat in the store for probably another year beforehand. Dated best before 9/8/04. The bottles we have where I work are dated sometime in 2007. Decants a deep ruby brown with lots of flaky protein coagulation and yeast suspended. Pillowy beige head that leaves excellent lacing on the Rochefort goblet. Complex aromas of yeast, esters, carob (almost chocolate) and gourmet caramel. This beer transcends words. It's malt profile is a bit reminiscent of a chocolate-like character, but more tame and subdued. Yeasty in the sense of it's unique yeast strain. Aging this beer really mellows it's characterisitcs. Velvety mouthfeel as well as being very drinkable for it's alcohol strength. Very smooth, or should I say smoov."
"Mild apple with acaramel malt body comes to mind as I first sip. Nicely light and moderate mouthfeel and body. almost feels like an apple puree. Don't ask, it just does. Cinnamon, anise, and clove all kick in for a slightly astringet and bitter ending. Yeast coats the tounge and leaves me wanting more."
"Overall: I like this brew very much. My first impression wes not all that great, because I felt the alcohol profile was too strong. Some beers do such a great job of masking the alcohol, and I didn't see that here. But after another try on another day, I really began to appreciate the complexities and richness of the flavor. I adjusted my review accordingly."
"Full bodied, syupy and lip tingling."
"I look forward to the next sample of this beer :)"
"i found it to be qwuite drinkable but I will not plop down the 9 bucks per bottle for this one again. on to Rochefort 10 for a taste..."
"This beer is delicious, maybe too delicious for a brew so potent."
"Very high cost at 7$ for a small bottle, but well worth it, I'd be glad to have this again!"
"ng"
"Poured out of the 11.2 oz bottle into the goblet with a very murky brownish red appearance. A lot of little Belgian yeast floating was observed around in the glass. The head was about an inch in height and died down pretty quickly. There was a generous amount of lace on the sides of the glass. The aroma was sweet-sour with cherries, licorice, molasses, and Belgian horse blanket smells wafting through. The taste was a balance between dark skinned dried fruits and dry peppery spiciness. The malt exhibited a roasty burnt quality, but not to a degree found in a stout or a porter. A more pronounced hop bitterness than that typically found in Belgian strong ales was also detectable. The beer was medium thick on the palette, and never felt watered down compared to its bigger and bolder brethren. This is one masterful brew thanks to those Trappist monks. If they did not require celibacy, Id have joined the order a long time ago."
"The taste is pretty excellent, sweet and malty like most trappist ales are and full of alcohol. I don't think I would recommend more than one at a time though, as it is not a quick drink."
"The taste, on the other hand, although good, is rather a bit to sweet. Very fizzy as well and the alcohol is (à mon avis) a bit too present, but is still well off. Slightly bitter end, rich body."
"Wonderful stuff, and something I would gladly purchase again Full of flavor, mellow, and drinkable....this reminds me of Jack Daniel's Tipsy Cake. Recommended Trappist."
"The mouthfeel is smooth and has a creamy consistency. Medium bodied. The caramel and pepper linger well into the aftertaste. The alcohol is not as noticeable as I thought it would be. Very drinkable and an absolutely enjoyable brew."
"This beer must be drunk on its own. To pair this with any foodstuff would only detract from the endless complexity and satiating aspects of the brew. One of my favorites."
"This is a ruddy, earthy, dark-brown beer. It presents a blanketing foam-like headtruly foam-likeits solid and full like a polyurethane cushion or acoustical foam (in a good way). Malty aroma, mixed with fruitsplum, cherry, rasin. Less phenols than I expected.yeasty, with a fresh bread-like smell, and slightly sweet-smelling. Serious carbonation in this brew: never ending streams of little bubbles crawl up the sides of the glass. Taste is sweet and slightly peppery. Very faint hoppiness, and very malty. The carbonation seems to help the beer spill throughout your entire mouth. Very full and rich. This is an extraordinary beer. I dont think its one of the best of the Trappist ales, but it cant be missed, and is certainly world-class."
"Overall, this is yet another excellent Belgian dark. Either I'm appreciating these Belgians more, or this one is just better."
"I got a marvelous big tan head ( almost meringue like ) on top of a very dark reddish body and left a nice lace. A slightly sweet aroma with a kind of bannana bread scent to it. As it warms up the alcohol smooths out the sweetness in the aroma. The alcohol asserts it self right away in the flavor but gives way a warm spicey bitterness that finishes very clean and smooth."
"My sample was only 7 months old, according to the bottle. This is an intriguing and sublime beer that I will buy again, this time to cellar."
"Sampled 12/14/03"
"My, my, what these yeasties can do! They make this Belgian complex and simple at the same time, defining refined and smooth. It exists on multiple levels, and each is full and satisfying. The ABV is not exactly sneaky, making a real and solid impression, but that's certainly to be expected, and the complete flavor profile does well in overcoming the alcohol's barriers and making another a virtual certainty. I've never been there, but I have to believe that Belgium is one very lovely, wonderful place."
"$4.99 for 12oz"
"A nice farewell beer to PA,(Iam moving in two days)at the Drafting Room in Spring House my favorite restaurant in the area.Pours a medium brown with some burgundy hints thru out with a nice big fluffy head that leaves some real nice lacing,aroma was top notch I would have to say one of the most aromatic brews I have had intensly fruity and juicy with a light spicey yeast aroma in the background.Taste is fruity and smokey with an underlying sweetness, just a whopper of a beer.I really hope to have again sometime what a treat!"
"I picked this up along with a bottle of Rochefort 10, and after sampling this I can't wait to try the 10. An excellent, very flavorful beer hurt only by a little bit of obvious alcohol presence. After taking one sip I realized what DFH was trying to nail down with their Raison d'Etre, but this is way better. Would be interesting to see how Rochefort 8 holds up in a cellar, given how far away the freshness date is."
"A cloudy chestnut color with a tan head. Acidic aroma with some chocolate,tobacco, and alcohol on the nose. A very bubbly light to medium body with a bit of a buttery texture. Flavors of sweet dark fruits (cherries,plums) and tobacco balanced with an alcoholic finish. A nice Trappist but not a standout."
"Pours out to what can best be described, as a cloudy, iced tea appearance in the glass with a very, decent head. Aroma is that of fruit, with figs, plums and raisins prominent. The taste is excellent and exhibits the yeast profile that it shares with with the ""6" and the ""10"" offerings. Extremely drinkable for a beer that clocks in at over 9% ABV, although the price prohibits drinking this in copius amounts. The ABV is exceptionally well-hidden. Another fantastic offering from this brewery and a must try."
"This beer does not even come close to the character & depth of either the 6 or the 10 from Rochefort. A bit dissapointing really. There is some dark fruitiness in the taste, but it is somewhat muted, and there is a musty, perhaps wet cardboard, flavor, which makes me think that perhaps this beer has been mistreated. I can't quite place it as oxidation damage though. This beer should be strong enough to shrug off any rough treatment it recieves during importation though. I will definitely have to try another sample later for a rerate."
"Equally delightful in its flavors. Yellow raisins and tropical fruits blend with spiced alcohol and a distinct cinnamon/nutmeg flavor. Very exotic and enticing. Alcohol hits you pretty well, but even as this warms, the full intensity remains caged, unlike this guy's big brother."
"cloudy brown with a thick light brown head. lots of yeast floating aorund. fruity aromas of figs and grape flavors. bready aromas from the yeast with mild chocolate too. a hint of apricots? bready fruit flavors. figs, raisins, white grape, a little of that apricot flavor (like dried apricots). some nutty flavors a bit of cofee underneath. aftertaste brings a slight peppery flavor. pretty sharp carbonation with a thicker side if meduim body. overall quite an experience. i wish i had another bottle, each sip changed my conception of the beer."
"Drinkability. Great. I could drink these sweet bad boys all damn night. Whoa. Wait a minute. There's the alcohol."
"Murky deep brown color with a low, off-white head that sinks quickly. No lace is left around the glass as I drink. Aroma is cinnamon and pear, some cocoa as well. Flavor is rich, with a mix of sweet fruit and cocoa, a tiny bit of hops, and a definite alcohol tingle in the finish. No strong or dominant flavors. Fig and raisin emerge as it warms. Good selection, but the ABV seems to take away from the flavor."
"Sparkely iced tea colored look in the goblet with yeasty floaties (they are my friends). Initial fluffy off white head leaves quickly .. disapates to a fine sheen on top of the brew. Sweet ripe dark fruits (plums) and sweet malts surrouns the nose. Very pungent smell. Initial taste of plums, red grape skins, and a sweet malt touch of brown sugar. The tongue is surrounded by tiny bubbles of lively carbonation and at the same time the thickish smooth mouth lets the brew nicely slither down the gullet. The finish leaves a slightly dry white pepper and sharp yeast tongue. Complex and crafted... a nice sippin' beer."
"Appearance: Deep ruby brown plum mahogany tone with a nice fluffy tan head leaves behind beautifully patterned webbed lacing so nice layers thick and coat on the sides of my WATOU St. Bernardus glass. Aroma: Pine cone scented hops are the first scent to fill up my senses, with a plethora of fruit tones apricot, mango, pineapple, rich fig brandy mixtures awesome esters at work adding crisp red apples tops it off. Taste: Banana like characteristic followed by a flood of alcohol taste the fruit tones in between the wave of alcohol and sweetness is soothing complex huge ale that has earned it's way to the top 50 Best of BA list. When you stop and think about it, it is pretty amazing that such a small bottle packs such a powerful punch. Mouthfeel: Silky soft tone medium bodied ale this brew is silky smooth. Drinkability: Besides the higher abv not much stops you from wanting another bottle the Trappist ale in all it's glory simply amazing brew must try for any beer lovers out there."
"About 8 years later, a wonderfully complex and easy drinking beer."
"Happy New year. Cheers."
"Crackles like a soda when poured. The head is oatmeal in color with a few brown floaties in it. Lots of sediment at the bottom of the dark brown beer. The aroma is of malt, nuts, caramel, and a little alcohol infused plum. Slightly bitter chocolate, roasted malt,and a bit of hazelnut coffee round out the flavor. The body is lighter than I expected, but solid enough to hold the flavors. A good beer, but I don't think I'll be plopping down the $4-5 a bottle very often."
"Another excellent Trappist, though not quite as good as the 10 (then again, what can be?). Still, if you prefer a drier taste, this will interest you. I still will likely have this one in the future."
"A fine Belgian, but not in the same league as its big brother, Rochefort 10, which I gave 5's across the board. I found the carbonation and alcohol burn distracting, which I didn't detect in the 10."
"The flavor at first matches the late nose, all cinnamon and ovaltine with a touch of grassy hop character, but as the beer transitions to the finish it grows progressively drier and nuttier allowing the spices to pick up and blend into the next sip."
"Notes: I understand what other people may see in this brew, but it's just not me. A little too intense overall."
"Great, smooth creamy mouthfeel with good carbonation. Rich and belly warming."
"This is one tasty brew!"
"bottled from bistro des bières belges: Dark and brown body with almost no carbonation. The small head doesn't last long. Complex yet light aroma of malt sweetness from chocolate and blackberries. Well-hidden alcohol in mouth, very malty. Complex in the sense I've got a hard time identifying the flavors.. what fruit was that? was that chocolate hiding in that black corner? was that toffee for a second? A fun game for a few sips which I rapidly replaced by the desire to drink it slowly while balancing and dreaming of a better world."
"Deep Chestnut colored body is topped by a thick fluffy tan head. Dark fruity aromas accented by roasted malt and a touch of hops. Wow, the taste is powerful, yet subtle. Fruity, yet not sweet. Solid, but finshes dry. Alcoholic warmth in the throat, but not on the nose. Powerful brew, light body. A great example of craftmanship. As it's nearly a religious experience, I'll savor this one into Sunday Morning."
"A damn nice brew! Change your mind about beer if you taste this one for the first time perhaps. Awesome deep orange/ruby color. Decent head and stick yet neither retain, and lose points because. Deep and perfumed aromatics-vannila sugar and english toffee. The mouthfeel is medium to full bodied with perfect carbonation. The baby sister to the #10, this beer is relatively crisp and less cheesy,still brings on the blue cheese, yet in a mellower manner. Some melon and soft chocolate notes can also be found. The beer finishes clean and bright-a super beer to stuff a stocking with!"
"Tawny, muddy brown hue with a sticky, creamy head that leaves great lace and sticks around for the duration of the brew. Aromas of yeast, sweet, candied malt, chocolate and esters revealing dark fruit fill the air. One sip reveals a wonderfully complex brew. Dried apricot, chocolate, dates, and sweet malt enlighten the palate while traces of alcohol and delicately spicy hops linger on the finish creating a somewhat vinous character. Wonderfully smooth, immensely creamy mouthfeel. It doesn't get much better than this. Incredibly drinkable, this is one awesome beer from the masterful monks at Rochefort. Like the Rochefort 10, this is simply a must-try."
"Appearance: Brown, dark, slightly cloudy. But head is pale, and rocky. Aroma: Candy sugar, dark malt and spices (including coriander). Big sweet aroma. Flavor: MaltyMalty, raisiny carmael malt flavors. Spices evident.Finish: Very dry, because of nicely balanced spices. Drinkability: is quite high for such a strong beer, added immeasurably by dry finish."
"OK, LongBeachBum took the words out of my mouth on this particular masterpiece. Simply put, one of the finest beers in the world for all the right reasons. Murky brown pour with smallish off white head. Sweet and dark, fruity notes along with plenty of malt and Belgian yeasty funk, this smells wonderful. Taste is oh so smooth and so very complex, it makes it difficult to analyze. All I know, or care to know, is that this has everything I love in a Belgian dark ale and nothing else. The aromas translate well into the taste. Ridiculous drinkability, and a smooth and creamy mouthfeel that is beyond. Wow, I am truly blessed ot have been able to sample this in my lifetime. Highly recommended!"
"Dark brown color. Large head. Aroma is malty, cherry with a touch of chocolate and brandy. A full bodied trappist ale. Big malt flavors. Chocolate, cherries and toffee. Touches of banana, vanilla and raisins. Well balanced. Extremely well balanced. Hides the 9.3% alcohol very well. I think I like this one better than the 10. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is lightly bitter."
" ...you would hear no complaints from me!"
"Murky brown hue, good depth, thick beige head. Sunk down like it was a nitro cool. Excellent retention. The bouquet blasted my sense with big, harsh, dry chocolate but that only lasted for a spilt second (and it never really returned). Sweet alcohol emerged as did tart dark fruits, candy-sugar good potency inviting. Dry, roasty malts, wood, faint pepper, sweet maltiness, distant alcohol construct a very tasty palate but its not very boastful. In the finish a note of fruit arrives the aftertaste is softly woody. The warmer it got the yeastier and breadier it became (but not irately so like Chimay). Complex this beer is tranquil. The mouthfeel is lightly creamy, smooth but thin. Chill out and sip this lovely treat. Very charming find it, try it, love it! Id buy this over the 10. Blasphemy?"
"And to think, I can just go down to my supermarket to buy it for about 1 euro (less than a dollar)! (Sorry, I couldn't resist rubbing it in!)"
"Overall, a good beer I enjoyed drinking, but not one I'll be in any hurry to pay $6 for a bottle again. Not a great beer to me like it is to a lot of people."
"Zowie!"
"Hazy chestnut color with no light transmission and a minimal 1/8 inch tan head that forms slight rings but minimal lace. Aroma is kick-ass and dank, with apricot and a spicy Fig Newton impression. Wonderful mouthfeel, coating and slightly oozing alcohol -- and marked with a malt monster medley of rum-soaked holiday fruit, molasses, bitter java, distinct carob, and re-inforced by aroma. Fully rounded profile, nicely mellow yet spiced in a thick manner above and beyond tossing stuff in an ordinary Ale. An equal or better (need a face-to-face) when compared with its big brother Trappistes Rochefort 10. Great beer, great drinkablity for style."
"All in all it was a good beer, but not up to my expectations. Plums,pears, bananas and spices all appeared, but none stole the show in the aroma department. Malty with a nice bitter finish. Alcohol was well hidden, appearance was good...not much else to say. There are better examples of the breed."
"(330 ml bottle). This superb Trappist ale pours with an enormous thick head, colour is cloudy dark brown. It has a lovely aroma of oak, leather, dried fruits and a hint of cigar tobacco. Flavour is malty and spicy with a warming mouthfeel, otherwise alcohol is well hidden. Dangerously drinkable! Moderate bitterness, rounded aftertaste. This ale truly belongs in the Premier League of Beers!"
"Update: The 2004 vintage is more of the same. Recently, I was able to pick up more complexity in the nose. In particular I found some darker fruits like dates and figs and raised the Smell rating by 0.5."
"Medium bodied, nice fullness to it. Depth of flavors that grabs your attention. This one is to be savored. Selling at $8.99 locally but worth every penny. I would much rather savor this and keep it for a special occasion than your regular old $15 bottle of wine. Unbelievably great tasting. Who would have thought I would find so many great tasting beers in Florida ? You just need to start looking."
"In some sense I was disappointed with this one, it's certainly a really good brew but this is what a high rating does. I'd recommend everyone this but don't expect anything over the top and you will like this alot!"
"Drinkablilty: A world class beer like this one is a year round favorite for me. I could have one anytime, with chocolate or as a night cap."
"Dark brown colour going a little bit on the red. Nice head when pourred that does not disapear too quickly. Roasted malts and higher alcohols are first impression. Very hearthy beer with a caramalized aftertaste. As usual with Trapist, a very fine beer."
"This brew poured a very large envigorated head of creamy fine light brown bubbles and a yeasty opaque light brown body. Its aroma was of a medium strength roasted malt. It had a very smooth complex palate with flavors of caramel malt and a very smooth but slightly tingly mouthfeel. I liked it better overall that the3 Rochefort 10. It had an excellent lacing."
"33cl bottle. Best before date of 11/12/07."
"First of all, I very, very much liked this brew versus the Rochefort 10. This was a much smoother tasting Rochefort than the 10. It poured a large invigorating tan head with fine-small bubbles. It had a fruity aroma to it and the lacing on the sides of my glass was fair. The body was light brown, yeasty, and murky. This was one fine smooth and enjoyable drink. However, I still prefer a Westy 12 over a Rochefort."
"Excellent stuff, yum!"
"Drinkability: Quite good for it's strength. This brew would match really well with a cold night and a good book. Strange that I finally get around to reviewing it in June..."
"Deep amber color with flat dense tan head. Fruity yeasty aroma with significant malt presence. Flavor is sweet with hints of berries. Malt is a near perfect blend. It's warming now and the flavor of cherries is coming out a little. Alcohol is not overbearing but effect is almost immediate. Mouthfeel is high effervescence yet smooth on the palate. Overall a well balanced and complex ale."
"Oridark red/brown color w/ a large tan head. Rochefort 8 has an aroma of a wonderful bakery. The flavor has lots of notes of sweetness along w/ a not so subtle presence of alcohol. This is a world class beer. Originally sampled on 3 October 2002 from bottle."
"This is the kind of beer I want to have in my fridge all the time but unfortunately it's availability makes that impossible. But that's the way it always is, right?"
"This ale poured (carefully) a clear, deep garnet brown color with a few millimeters of creamy tan foam that settle to a film and left no lace. The smell was very nice: sweet, figs, raisins, caramel, oak, biscuit, vinous grapes, and a mild alcohol odor. The taste was mildly sweet with flavors of caramel, fruit (figs, apples, faint banana), and alcohol. There was also a bit of tartness, and a hint of floral hops in the background. The mouthfeel was creamy and smooth, medium-full bodied, with low carbonation. This was very drinkable as an after dinner drink. This beer tasted much better just below room temperature, and suffered when initially poured directly from the refridgerator."
"-F"
"This beer pours a dark murky brown with hints of red. This is the best beer I've ever had. It smells great and it tastes great. The aftertaste is even better than the flavor. Very smooth and completely satisfying. Extremely easy to drink and the alcohol is well masked."
"This bottle went down verrrrry nicely. I'll be looking for this one again."
"This wasn't quite as good as the ""10"" but still a very good beer. Pours a pretty dark reddish-brown with a very thick and foamy beige head. Aroma of chocolate, cherry, malt and cloves. Smooth-drinking, with flavors of banana, malt, sherry and chocolate all vying for attention. Great finish, if a little carbonated toward the end for my tastes. All in all another fine effort from Rochefort."
"I often find Belgian ales a little on the sweet side, but here I felt that the beer could benefit from a little sweetness to balance the bitter finish. Overall, I found the beer to be rather harsh and unfriendly."
"Deeper in color than its younger sibling, Rochefort 8 presents itself as a dark red beer with a finger-thick creamy head. Persistent with a decent lace, though surprisingly not as much as the 6. The aroma, however, is far richer, with a solid base of roasted, coffee-like malt, hints of fig and vanilla, and a slight alcohol nose. The alcohol is also much more noticeable in the flavor  its actually almost a bit overpowering in the first sip. The second sip, however, is much kinder. Bready flavors dominate, with a sweet malty flavor showing up first, followed by dark fruit, and finally a lovely bittersweet chocolate finish. A bit spicy throughout as well, perhaps ginger? As the beer warms, the alcohol mellows to a gentle peppery flavor which blends nicely into the overall flavor profile of the beer. Fuller in mouth and dryer in finish than the 6; Rochefort 8 is a really splendid beer."
"33cl brown bottle, served close to room temperature, entire bottle poured. It's very murky, just slightly opaque brown. The head forms quickly and is enormously fluffy. It's always a treat to admire the appearance of beers like these. An awesome aroma of dark fruits and malty sweetness is easily noticeable. It's very sweet up front, with zingy carbonation, then a very smooth dark fruitiness as well as some caramel come through. The finish is kind of dry with noticeable alcohol. It's a pleasure to drink this, quite a pleasure."
"Drinkability: A beer that was really ""filling"". I thought this would be a little less sour that it was. I didn't find myself constantly reaching for the glass for another sip. I really nursed it. Not that it was bad by any stretch of the imagination. Perhaps my taste buds were recovering from the liquid assault."
"Taste: Maple, alcohol and overripe, almost rotting fruit. This is like eating a rye bread and banana sandwhich with brown sugar powder."
"Decent, but there are many better examples....especially given the price."
" Boy oh boy is this good. There is a little roastiness from dark malts. Spices come in a bit later, and the finish has the alcohol. The alcohol is well-hidden, and it is balanced with a nice dry roasted finish. This is a marvelous brew that i will enjoy many more times. I can't wait to try a few more from these guys."
"436"
"Other drawback is that the only place I've been able to buy this was in a wine shop that overprices and undersells it's quality beer. It was in a clearance bin, marked down. Maybe a better cared for bottle would have tasted differently?"
"This beer poured a very dark amber and formed a light tan head that left circular lace. There were small particles present due to the bottle conditioning. A heavy aroma of malt and caramel with a hint of citrus. A flavor of malt and caramel. A slight tang to the finish is present."
"""WHOA BABY!"" is that a ""Rochefort"". ""Darn straight", you can tell it by that ""Fantastic"" aroma, that of a fine brandy, malts and some plums ""WOW""! Pours a nice deep cloudy brown, luxuriant light chocolate head and the lace in layered sheets to coat the glass. Big malt start, the top is middling, the finish is meticulously hopped, masterfully carbonated, droughty alcohol bitter aftertaste. ""Alcohol"" definitely rears its head at the finish as it warms you pleasantly, what a great beer!!!"
"The 8 has a cottony mouthfeel that seems to be common in the lighter belgian strongs, but this one isn't as abrasive as some. Aroma and flavor are scuppernong grape fruitiness and alcohol. A lighter and softer beer than its big brother."
"Hazy deep chestnut hue, topped by an formidably thick, almost animated light tan head supported by prodigious bubbles.  After what seems to be an eternity, the head settles and leaves signature lace.  Tart cherries and mellow chocolate upfront in aroma, along with raisiny notes and caramel from the dark candi sugar. Buttery malt becomes noticeable as the beer warms and breathes. Mild chocolate and banana are perceptible at first in flavor and are ensued by notes of darkly caramelized fruit and a date - like sweetness.  Hop bitterness is only indirectly noticed by its offsetting of malt sweetness. Full in body, w/ a dextrinous, liquid velvet mouthfeel.  Finishes w/ waves of dark caramel lingering.  Alcohol warmth slowly emerges as an afterthought.  Rochefort 8 is fabulous.  The residual sweetness is well controlled and the combination of chocolate notes and fruit is superlative.  Although very flavorful, Rochefort 8 maintains a elegant mellowness. Outstanding to say the least.  Rochefort 10 should be a treat!"
"This brew is a murky burgandy. Big crop of light beige head adorns the surface. And retention is outstanding. Nice looking piece of work. Nice aroma! Subdued fruitiness, oak, dried prunes and spices (nutmeg and cinamon come to mind). Sweet candy and bubblegum as well. This is one of the best tasting belgians I have tried so far. It has a very refined taste. Woody, nutty and slightly fruity. Some subdued spice notes (slight ginger, anise and pepper). This beer is 9.2% a/v?!? Couldn't tell. No alcohol on the buds and very easy drinking and mellow. Can't wait to try the 10."
"Notes: Hard line in the aroma and flavour with a mellowed aged flavour from a bottle that has been around for a while, this age has not taken way from the beer at all other than its head retention perhaps. Ripe and fruity, malty and alcoholic. The complexity alone is staggering for the taste buds."
"Prosit."
"Very tasty, chocolatey, spicy, complex. Not as complex as the 10, but a bit easier to handle, i can dig it."
"This beer is exceptionally smooth for being at 9.2. This one, like the 10, is all about the malt. It has an expectional dark red/brown color, it has a nice body but is significantly lighter than the 10, along with a higher more prickly carbonation. Promenant sweet plum like flavor. If you thought the 10 was too thick and rich this may be more to your liking being lighter in body and brighter / fruiter in flavor. I'm going to do a side by side against 8 and Chimay Red and 10 and Blue for fun."
