"Depending on how cold you keep your fridge, this needs a few to warm up a little to let all the goodness open up. Pours a dark, murky brown with a fizzy tan head that burns off quickly. There is no lacing. The aroma starts out a little tight, with some pleasant dark fruit notes but really comes out a little warmer with some nice caramel notes and more robust fruits. The body has a nice weight, not heavy or thin and a smooth finish."

"Pours a slightly hazy dark brown with orange tint, big but fizzy light brown colored head, spray of lace trailed down the glass. Smell: pear, red grape, brown sugar and bread notes, slightly peppery. Taste: brown sugar, peach and orange notes, brown bread, spicy, into a peach skin finish. Light upfront for the style into fluffy feel, quick on the tongue but easy drinking. Tasty."
"Complex flavors a bit weird for a  scotch ale. But good!"
""
""
"Uniquely fruity with cherryy hints perhaps.   Interesting."
""
""
""
""
"AS time goes by the back half o f the bottle yields a much richer flavor & texture. This is a fine beer. Not the usual Belgian nor the usual spiced  winter warme, just a good solid cold weather brew that needs to be barely chilled."
""
""
""
""
""
"Colour is  between red en light brown. Bittersweet taste with some plum and raisin details. Good beer, but not d'Achouffes greatest work though."

"A lot lighter bodied than anticipated, light effervescence, slightly warming and a faint dryness."
""
""
""
"Overall, this beer didn't quite live up to expectations, although I'd get it again. It offers a different take on a brown ale."
""
"Finishes smooth without lingering too long. Easy to drink for an 8% avb."
"O: This is a really nice brew. It's rich and chocolatey yet relaxing and mellow. The Belgian yeast adds a lovely tanginess to the chocolate flavors. Feels like I'm back in Belgium. Just a tiny bit on the sweet side."
""

""
""
"O - tidy beer, well balanced taste, and im impressed with both the mouthfeel and muted alcohol.  The only let down is the smell - the fresh yeast smell isn't pleasant, so block your nose when you drink!"
"I could drink this stuff by the bucketful. Smooth, packed with flavors of figs, grape, pepper. So easy to drink. Medium body. Some spiciness and bitterness. Dangerously delicious."
""
"Feel: medium+ carbonation is soft but seems a little bit too high; medium body."
""
""
""
""
"11.2oz bottle. Pours a dark cloudy brown with a medium lasting beige head. Aroma is sweet dark fruit, plums, Belgian yeast and bread notes. Taste same as aroma with mild bitterness and tart notes. Palate is a medium body with good carbonation. Finishes with dark fruit, plums some raisins, Belgian yeast, bread and tart notes followed by mild bitterness on the end. Aroma and taste get stronger as it warms up. Overall a very good, full flavored brew."

"DATE REVIEWED: June 6, 2014... GLASSWARE: Chimay chalice... OCCASION: a week of returning to workouts--protein is welcome!... APPEARANCE: dark purple body; soft, wispy off-white head that thins out to an uneven, varied density; nice, intricate lacing... AROMA: immediate prune and apple; hops are aromatic and yeast adds some funk to an otherwise sweet malt... PALATE: thick, creamy, a bit chewy, and warming; easy-drinking and dry at the finish; a fleet, discrete presence--good, solid brown ale base... TASTE: grape and prune are the dominant flavors; smoky malt surprises, as does the lack of alcohol; rather flat at the finish... OVERALLL: a classy, slightly subdued version of tits usual and Christmas varieties; situation is key--introduced this at Thanksgiving a decade ago, but it didn't pair with the main courses well; as a nightcap, it can open with its complexity or close with its strength...."
"Don't have time for tasting notes on this one. Just want to update: Opened a bottle from April '12 and it's still excellent. Not preferred cellar temp (~60F). Very enjoyable right now, sweetness has subsided into a very relaxed melange of brown Belgian goodness. Nary a breath of alcohol and pure delicate quench on the back of the tongue. Hope my ambiguity inspires you to try and/or pop it now."
""
"O: not a bad brown ale, but I wouldn't go out of my way to find a store that sell it"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a great Belgian Strong Dark Ale, well balanced, tasty and pleasant to drink. Not overly complex at first, but reveals its notes throughout the degustation. Not really a sipper once it can be very drinkable, but you still want to take it slowly to harvest all it has to offer."

"33cl bottle (08 2016) into a tulip. Brown color, two finger tan head that settles down pretty quickly, some lacing. Sweet malty aroma. The taste starts spicy, followed by a sweet but not sugary taste of roasted malts that grows in the mouth, finishing with a dry malty aftertaste. Slight alcohol in the taste. Medium-light body with a medium carbonation, smooth mouthfeel. Overall an enjoyable beer but not that special."

"O: having had this a few times, really enjoying it some of those times, it's frustrating when it seems not quite on... I would venture a loose comparison to a Belgian homage to Traquair House Ale, mostly in its expression of dark-sugar flavors - not nearly a parallel in overall composition... the proprietary Achouffe yeast factors relatively moderately into its taste, for better or worse"

"The dark offering from this fairly well-known brewery in the Ardennes. I have read that these guys only use malt syrups rather than whole grains ... True? In any event, this is certainly a well-attenuated and thin-bodied dark ale that does indeed capture some Scottish flavor elements, albeit with a decidedly Belgian profile nonetheless. A dark reddish brown brew, maybe leaning towards the red, with a moderate amount of light tan head and an aroma that is equal parts fruity esters, spicy medicinal phenols, and sweet caramel or toffee along with a vinous wine or cider-like note. Nice balance between the caramel elements and Belgian spice although I am less wild about the cidery component. Palate largely reflects this, such that I initially get some apple and pear fruit followed by clove spice, golden raisin, musty white peppercorns, faint molasses and bandage-like phenols, and perhaps a whiff of citrus rind. Rather dry, powdery mouthfeel and this brew just screams thinned down with a healthy sugar addition to the kettle. Some alcohol is apparent but not over the top in this regard. Really my main issue is the ultra-thin body and correspondingly airy mouthfeel but the flavor is solid."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A solid BSDA. Perhaps, a sweeter example."
"O: I didn't feel there was anything special here, just a solid offering. I can't tell if part of the profile is similar to the Houblon Chouffe, which I thoroughly enjoyed, but it was mildly familiar."
""
""
""
""
"O: Good, a beer without obvious faults, only minus point was the fact it can be interchanged with quite a few other BSDAs."
""
""
""

"Ardennes water at the core, this is a must try."

"MF â€“ Medium bodied, with a dry finish. Sharp in the middle. 3.75"
""
""
""
"Overall 4.0: Pleasant, but very complex and enjoyable. This is a beer that deceives you with its goofy little smurf-like character and its whimsical talk on the back of the bottle about the Chouffe and his Scottish friend, but make no mistake. This is a serious brew from artisans who are experts in the art of brewing. I would recommend this beer to any and all fans of Belgian beer, especially those who are fans of the Dark Side...er, style. ;)"

"Overall this is enjoyable on this beautiful fall day defiantly worth a try if you see it on a shelf near you."
""
"o: good strong dark ale, drinkable"
""
""
"Impressive offering here. Well worth exploration. It's not exactly cheap, so that could scare some people away. However, if you can get past that, you're in for fantastic big beer."
""
""
""
"From my tasting notes: The McChouffe was touted as a Belgian Scotch Ale and was the obvious darker beer of the night. It came with a fluffy tan head and more Belgian yeast notes in the aroma with some sweet malts as well. It was much maltier than the La Chouffe with hints of toffee and dark fruits with the signature Belgian yeast notes as well. Another well balanced and drinkable beer that I will need to try again."
""
""
"O: a nice beer, pretty basic and straightforward for a BSDA. I like the warm feeling that it leaves and while not the best I've had, it is a good beer and easy to drink."
"Feels pretty sweet upon finishing, maybe just a bit much for my taste. The balance is nice and the flavors are plentiful making it a satisfying experience. All in all the flavor is just nice."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is the best beer of its style that I've found...at least to my tastes."
"Mahogany pour with an off-white two finger head with nice retention and great lacing. Very malty nose with hints of Belgian yeast, brown bread, banana, nuts, toffee, caramel, and dark fruits. The taste follows suit, dominated by malty caramel sweetness. Hints of tobacco, dark fruit, molasses, Belgian yeast, bubblegum, banana, brown bread, and nuts round out the taste. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate to fizzy carbonation with a syrupy sweet finish. Overall, this is a solid Belgian Bruin, albeit a bit sweet for more than one."
""
""
"McChouffe has a malty enough anchor, but its mossy, woody sweetness is overlaid by a light Belgian yeastiness and, I suppose, a touch of hops. And so, the beer is not as cloying as a Scotch ale can be. Whether that's a good thing is a matter for debate. One can also argue the merits of the beer's texture, which is noticeably more prickly than creamy. We can agree, however, that McChouffe is wee light, and that such a brew has its place. A tip o' the tam-o-shanter to Achouffe's agents in Cooperstown for making this one available."

"I had 4 shots at this beer, 4 bottles over the course of three days. Really unique beer I thought, nver had anything quite like it. I would add that there was a strong smell and taste of green apples to this beer and it really seems to have something that stimulates your blood to flow making you feel pleasantly warm and relaxed all over. I will see k this beer out in the future, a real favorite for me."
""
"O: It's a good example of a Belgian Strong Dark Ale even though the alcohol wasn't that much dissimulated to be able to get more complexity out of the beer. Basically there was too much alcohol for this flavor. Yet, it might've been one of the best BSDA that I've had for months."
"One of my favourite this great McChouffe!"

"O: Awesome Belgian Brew â€“ great flavors and aromas."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Good beer. Not what I was expecting. It was a lot sweeter than I had hoped but thankfully it is a really fresh sweetness (not sticky/suffocating at all). Definitely not the best Belgian Brown I have had DEFINITELY not as good as their sweet, sweet IPA. But good. Would have again, but probably would not buy it again. If that makes sense."
"O- A very enjoyable beer, and has held up impressively well after this amount of time."

"O: certainly an odd beer. I wouldn't jump at this one, but not that I can't appreciate it's quality and uniqueness."
"Overall this beer is okay. It is kind of one dimensional when it comes to the malt and the hops. What makes it impressive is the yeast strain. The phenols and pepper are rather enjoyable."

"O: This is a very enjoyable and drinkable beer. It is not overly complex, but the typical Belgian flavours you expect are present. Alcohol is there, but not overt as to highlight that it is 8%."
""
""
""
"Overall a solid beer, I usually prefer my dark ales a little sweeter and more fruity but this is an interesting 'different' offering."
""
""
"Overall â€“ Quite enjoyable and a nice mix of flavours. It was a touch cloying as it warmed up, but still tasty. I'd drink this one again but there are other belgian darks I'd drink before it."
"O-The first belgian dark I've tried. A nice complex and clean drinking beer. I really dig the look of this beer. Spot on for the style from what I read at least :p"
""
""
""
""
"The beer is chestnut brown with a thick, khaki hued head. Lasting retention with ample lacing. The aroma offers a prominent dose of Belgian yeast right up front. Distinctly Belgian all the way. Brown bread, brown sugar, light spice, a bit of toffee and caramels. Relatively light bodied and fairly sweet. Moderate carbonation with only a touch of alcohol. A really solid beer. A nice beer to revisit now and then."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - This is a clean, dry, well-made beer. It is only lacking in some complexity to make it truly great."
""
"A nice but, I would say I enjoyed it more than La Chouffe that I tried early last year but it's not a classic Belgian ale really."
"Overall a pretty good beer."
""
""
""
""
"O: Alcohol shows a bit too much, but otherwise I like this yeasty BSDA."
""
""
""
"B-"
"On tap at Kickbacks in Jax. Poured into a snifter. Light beige head, moderate retention with sticky, clear lacing on a light brown almost tudor brown body. Aroma dominated by raisins and dates with a touch of fig and a touch of some brown sugar. Taste is very raisin like with nice caramel malts and some candi sugar, brown candi sugar if there is such a thing. Either way, classic Belgium and classic Chouffe. Way to drinkable and totally delicious."
"O-a nice beer. Not overly anything. Soft mouthfeel and pretty easy to drink"
""
""
""
"Overall: I decided to try this brew after having La Chouffe, which I enjoyed immensely. Unfortunately, McChouffe is not nearly the same quality. This is not a bad beer but there is nothing special about it."
""
""
"Overall - This is really tasty. A combo of brown ale,wee heavy and belgian strong ale. Loads of flavor, smooth and really easy to drink. Had no idea what to expect. Balanced and unique, this beer is different from anything ive had before. Each time i take a sip, i discover something else. THis is a excellent beer, i hope you give this a shot."
"A good beer malty and sweet but perhaps a bit too sweet but none the less a good robust beer."
""
""
"Lovely wooden brown in color with a medium fading lightly tanned head. Develops aromas of basement and dust, yeast and hints of roasted malts. Fizzy on the tongue building up a slick bit thin texture but which develops some mouthwatering bitterness. The roast pertains on the palate but which is not unpleasant, far from it, it actually adds to the finish and makes the body. Amazing beer!"
""
"O - Not too bad at all. Would enjoy again. I wonder how the green bottle affects what's going on inside."
""
"Poured into a tulip glass, colour is a dark malty brown, with a nice creamy head of tan white film that lingers to the end very impressively. Smell has rich malty esters, some coffee, molasses and roasty malt, but fairly mild. Taste has a big rich malty, molasses, slight nuttiness and a slight bit of earthy bitterness. There is also a bit of boozeyness that creeps through on the finish. Mouthfeel is big and rich. Although this is a nice BSDA, its a bit unbalanced in comparison to Chouffe's other offerings and doesnt really display the same great complexity. A very pretty beer nonetheless."
""
""
"I could finish a few bottles of that one and would not regret it"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this is a wonderful dark ale by brewers who clearly know how to brew great beer. Belgian brown ales (Dubbels) are normally a seamless melding of malt, hops and yeast and this is no exception. Not exactly brewed to style, more brown toasted malt than dark fruitiness but I enjoy the change here."
""
""
""
"Review from 5/2010 notes. Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Pours a dark orange brown, nice long lasting tan head and lacing. Aroma of sweet and caramel hops, light and dark fruit, Belgian spice. Medium bodied. Dark fruit, hops, Belgian yeast, a touch of sweet malt throughout. They nailed a cross between a Belgian and Scotch ale. Flavors increase as the ale warms. Medium bodied. A nicely balanced, tasty ale. Well done."
"The feel is pretty creamy but mingling with a moderate crispness in about a medium body. It gets a little smoother as the sip lingers, though, and everything works together well."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a clear honey brown with a foamy beige head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, caramel, slight smoke, and some fruity aromas. Taste is much the same with a mild level of bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer and a nice Belgian take on a Scotch ale."
""
""
"Dark raisin brownish red in color. Poured with a short rich foam. Smooth, rich delicate feel. Lighter on the front end but the body grows as the light, lazy rich carbonation rolls through. Earthy dark fruit aromas with a hint of sweet dark malt. Dark fruit flavors up front and into the middle. Pleasant spicy hop bitterness at the middle that leads to sweet dark malt and chocolaty flavors to the end. Finishes with a tangy spicyness and lingering ripe dark fruity sweetness."
""
"D - petty good if a bit odd. The malt is a bit heavy for the yeast character but the spicy hops."
"Overall: This one is almost too sweet ad lacks a little balance on that way. It's still good and overall drinkable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours dark brown, reddish tints, some foam sits atop. Good lacing, light malty and nutty smell. Some caramel but faint. Taste is very smooth and even lightly sweet brown ale. Some nuttiness, some cola and root beer buried. Creamy mouthfeel almost reminds me of a soda beverage. Very good."
""

"750 ml bottle into tulip glass, best by 2013. Pours cloudy reddish brown color with a dense 1-2 finger khaki head with good retention that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Some nice soapy lacing on the glass. Aromas of caramel, plum, molasses, raisin, pepper, nuttiness, light chocolate, and yeast spices. Fairly nice and well balanced aromas with good strength. Taste of toffee, molasses, plum, raisin, biscuit, pepper, chocolate, dark candi sugar, nuttiness, and yeast spices. Lingering notes of molasses, caramel, dark fruit, pepper, chocolate, and yeast spices on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance of flavors. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a fairly creamy and slightly slick mouthfeel. Very smooth to drink for 8%. Alcohol is well hidden with only a slight warming after the finish. Overall this is a very nice Belgian dark ale. Nice complexity and balance; and very smooth to drink. Really enjoyed this one."
"Mc Chouffe is a cloudy raspberry brown ale with clumps of yeast swirling around in it. It has a huge head that leaves great lacy foam on the glass. Foam started blasting from the bottle after I opened it. There are herbs and bread in the aroma, along with something tropical like melon and a note of phenol. It's pretty full bodied and super soft with a dry, chewy finish. It's almost a hint sweet with a spicy herbal bitterness. The malt is thick, like caramel. It tastes earthy and perhaps slightly resiny. The slight sweetness stays steady as the juniper-like bitterness grows. Both flavors linger for a while after the swallow. There's almost a hint of anise and some sort of herbal tea. This is a real treat to drink: Well balanced, flavorful and interesting."
"Poured, from a 330 ml bottle. Very dark brown colour which turns to a deep amber against the light, with minimal bubbles. Head is brownish, leaving a light lacing on the glass as it fades out (fast). Nice sweet aroma of vanilla and fruit. Taste is bitter and follows the aroma, the 8% alcohol is not so obvious. Medium thin bodied on palate,lightly carbonation. Overall a great brown beer that I would happily suggest."
"A good beer and one I will go for again."
"O - very tasty, phenol dominated is always a treat relative to most big belgians I have access to, while not a 'regular' per say this is definitely a go to dark Belgian for me"

"Overall: A Scotch Ale style mixed with a good Belgian Dark Ale...great idea! The extra malts and slight smoky/peaty flavors go really well with the sweeter Belgian yeast and higher ABV sweetness. I really like this one!"
"I've never had a Scotch Ale before, but this seemed more like a straight up Belgian to me than anything."
"I think this beer can only be properly presented whilst pronouncing its name in a crappy fake Scottish accent. It pours a deep sienna topped by a finger or so of khaki foam. The nose comprises toffee, light nuts, light brown sugar, light dark fruit, and a touch of Belgian yeast. The taste brings in more of the same, though the toffee seems to flatten out a bit and cover everything else in a fine veneer of itself. It all comes out spicily bland, but in a good way...if that makes any sense... The body is a light-leaning medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a sorta/kinda dry finish. Overall, a nice little brew, nothing in any way exciting, but I would definitely not turn down another if it were offered to me."
""
""
""
""
""
" Overall, a great belgian brown, but doesn't have the strong alcohol punch. Very easy drinking for the style, just a touch weak (alcohol) and a little sugary. Still, very glad I tried this. Easy and creamy and a beauty in the goblet."
""
"Really great beer...tasty and unique. Worth drinking for sure."
"One of my favourite!"

"As I looked at the selection, I instantly wished that I knew more about Belgium beers. I understand a little French and shopkeeper was willing to bring to me some of the local beers and the traditional favorites. (Side note: it is *very* helpful to have a wife that speaks and understands French!) She pointed out which beers were still made by monks (down to five, she said), and those breweries which tend to create craft beers. She loves to make gift baskets, filled with beers, glasses and other treats. I can't wait to return!"

"Medium bodied with a nice balance of zesty spice, sweet malt and dark fruit. Â Lots of peppery spice up front followed by sweet malt flavors, notably caramel and toffee before finishing with a prominent dark fruit presence. Â Hints of plum, raisin, currant and other dark berries. Â Subtle alcohol sweetness but not much heat. Â Could use a stronger malt character to balance out swet fruits but still pretty good."

""

"Nice deep amber color capped by a small sized off white heads. Scent trends sweet with caramel, plum, balanced by light grass. Taste is also sweet, caramel, light plum and cherry. Wish the flavors were more pronounced but tasty no the less. Light bodied, yum."

"I uncorked this expecting a decent, yet overall mediocre beer with my meal. I was taken back by the robust flavor of the beer. It was not only outstanding on its own, but enhanced the flavor of my meal (burger). I found myself savoring every sip of this fine drink. A complex and greatly enjoyable drink. If you are a fan of belgian ales, this will not fail to impress. I will be buying this regularly."

"O - can't complain at all about this one. very solid for the style and a very good beer all around"
"O - I liked this beer. Not a bad offering from d'Achouffe."
"Overall, the flavour leaves a bit to be desired, but this is still worth checking out. An interesting take on a Scotch Ale from a belgian brewer."
"O: A better than average Dubbel that would be better if the alcohol taste did not come through as much."
"Overall nice Belgian strong dark/dubbel style, a bit much on the esters and sticky sweet flavors, but nice fruits balance it."
"O - A good double, no doubt about it, nicely balanced."
"Nose brings loads of dark fruits and a bit of sweetness. Flavor falls along the same lines, though the two don't mix quite as well as in the nose. Medium body and good carbonation. Semi-dry finish. Well made and quite tasty."
"I bought this at a Belgian beer festival, and the promoters labeled this in their Specialty beer unfiltered brown ale category. I think that this is a better classification than BA's 'Belgian Strong Dark Ale'"
"T: Similar to the nose with heaps of peppery brown bread crust which were ever so slightly burned. While not overwhelming dry, but all flavors tends to be dry. Dry pepper and complex spiciness, dry brown toasted quite melanoidin-y malts. Very little malty sweetness though. However, an overall lack of bitterness saves the palette from an unpleasant onslaught. Light mint, herbal hops round out the middle. Finish has a touch of minty herbal hop to it with lingering dark cocoa and spiced brown bread."
"O - A sweet, spicy nectar. No heat to it even as it warms. Delicious, just falls below the top BSDAs in terms of complexity."
"O - Aside from the low carbonation (which is still enjoyable), I have no complaints whatsoever. It seems like more of a slightly-strong dubbel than a strong dark ale, so for the price I'd probably grab a case of Westmalle Dubbel instead (just because that's one of my favorites). Nevertheless, I'm very glad I picked this up. If you like strong, dark, fruity, Belgian ales, you will not be disappointed by this."
"Overall: Anything with a gnome on the label has my attention and this certainly did. It was a good beer with some good flavor, but nothing I would actively search out. Good overall."
"Belgian character underneath a lot of sweet malts. Not very Scottish, in spite of what they were aiming for. Berry too up front. A sipper."
"jd"
"More Belgian than Scotch but never-the-less a very tasty brew. This has been on my to-do list for quite a while so Iâ€™m glad to finally have gotten around to trying it."
"Edit: Turns out this is a scotch ale. Weird, wasn't expecting that. Explains the lack of yeasty/fruity notes, obviously, but it still doesn't cut it overall."
"Pours a hazy deep amber to brown in color with a light tan head. In the aroma, earthy and candy sugar. In the taste, earth, peet, malty, and a small candy sugar. A yeasty and sugar bite and medium bodied mouthfeel, with a small dry earthy aftertaste. Almost saison like, small dry amlt and great."
"O: Overall a very nice brew. Great fruity notes, meld with grain and classic belgian yeast characteristics."
"Overall a great beer, especially on tap."
"O: Pretty good brew, not one of my favorites, but easy drinking with a good flavor profile."
"750ml bottle at Winstons in Saskatoon. Pours into a goblet a ruddy, muddy brown color, couple fingers of khaki head. Smells of grapes and light cherry esters, toffee and bread. Flavor follows, candi sugar, grapes, cherry, plums, rye bread, hints of coffee. Easy and not too complex, perhaps a little thin in the body. Hides the ABV well, easy to drink, nothing wrong here."
"Overall: This was awesome. Had no idea this was even available on tap. Not cheap, but worth it. Will definitely look for in bottles."
"Supposedly this pays hommage to the Scottish influence that Belgium received during WWII. More of a Belgian-y interpretation of a Northern English brown than anything resembling a Scottish ale. What a bummer. I expect more of Achouffe and their gnomish minions."
"Now, Iâ€™m not saying this beer is badâ€¦ but to come all this way from the Belgium and just be this good, I am hurt! Come on beer guys, you can do better than that. I would buy a bottle of this again, but it would have to either be on sale or the liquor store would have to be out of everything else! I like the story of the hobbitâ€¦ but sadly, that is more exciting than what lay in the glass. Bottoms upâ€¦ if you can stomach it."
"This poured out as a dark brown color with a tan colored head. The aromas were sweet and really interested me in the beer. The malts kind of gave me an earthy aroma too in the faint distance. The taste was on the sweeter side, a little more like a sweet version of an Abbey Dubbel. The mouthfeel was pretty smooth and found myself enjoying this brew for the most part. I don't know if I'd ever buy a whole lot of it but I'd try it again one day."
"( 33/50, 8.5% alc/vol, Home) Unfiltered red ale that leaves a brown head of average height. Very fizzy. Metal, sugars (the belgian candi kind). Fresh, like cotton candy. Brown sugar, sugar canes. So sweet, the malt nuances are killed off almost completely, although it is quite tasty. Hops flavours are very good, kills sugars and adds a strong dry finish to the beer. Bee-wax, acidic palate. Very sugarry with some metallic tones due to alcohol (and since it's SAQ, its probably aged and badly handled). Definite sweet belgian strong ale. Would drink this warmer at next attempt. Good, but overdone in my opinion. Lets give this a try with coffee cakes and sweet deserts."
"O: Excellent beer as expected"
"A great Belgium strong dark. The light body makes it easier to drink and a little more approachable for beginners than some. All in all, a solid offering."
"drinkable - one, maybe two. overall - great brew."
"The mouthfeel is creamy and smooth and the flavour presents a dark, fruity sweetness followed by a gentle finishing bitterness."
"Cheers!"
"Medium brown cloudy brew. Lovely malty aroma withsubtle fruity Belgian yeast. This is smoother, dryer and more subtle than many Balgians, thi smust be the Scottish influence. Still more Belgian than Scottish. Very nice and good with food."
"An interesting beer, though beyond the increased maltiness I don't get much Scottish Ale character per se. Would pair well with a variety of dishes - I picked up another bottle to try in place of my usual Chimay Grand Reserve (Blue) in ""Konijntje met Trappistenbier en Oesterzwammen," my favored Flemish rabbit recipe."
"Good beer!"
"Overall and Drinkability: I thought the drinkability on this one quite good and I'd not hesitate to have a second, either right away or in the future. This is definitely a beer to drink with only a light chill. Over all I quite enjoyed this beer."
"At the Thirsty Monk on tap. Pours a brownish amber with whitish head. Yeasty nose with notes of caramel, malt and alcohol. Taste is very complex and requires some sorting - belgian sugar, caramel, belgian yeast, toffee, candy, pilsner malts, saaz malts and light alcohol. Finishes clean. Nice scottish ale."
"Overall: very good beer. Amazingly refreshing for a strong Belgium beer. In my opinion better than the blonde version. A must try."
"Drinkability: Possibly my favorite beer from the Achouffe brewery. Drinks like a beer half its strength. Awesome stuff."
"M/D: Fairly carbonated, which works well for this beer. Easily drinkable, even with a higher percentage of alcohol."
"D - While this is a good beer, it's not something I'd be interested in having a whole lot of. One better split."
"Flavor is a nice mix of mild and funky, with toasted brown barley and cocoa up front, finishing with overripe banana and spices. Hops are also somewhat floral and add a prick of pepper. Alcohol is quite muted. Well brewed, and quite nice all the way through."
"Drinkability: not one I would get every day. The nose is amazing, but the flavor is lacking."
"D- Really easy to drink (almost no taste of alcohol) but it leaves on the palate a dull sweet taste that gets you bored after a while"
"Pours a hazy dark brown color with a light but foamy head. Aroma is dark fruits, caramel, and spices. Taste is also dried fruits with caramel and a gentle earthiness. The beer is light on the palate and easy to drink. Even with 8% abv, you don't get much of the alcohol in the flavor."
"The taste is quite good. For a Belgian this is quite smooth and creamy, and it doesn't have the prickly mouth feel and overcarbonation on the tonge that is typical. The booziness is subdued, there are plenty of sweet candied sugars, darkish malts, but no real spiciness to the beer. There may be a touch of coriander or star anise, but it is mild. The beer is quite pleasant. It isn't overly complex, but quite nice. The Belgiany candied sugars are very evident. The caramels and some darkish malts are quite evident as well. The aftertaste is mild. This one is worth seeking out for its overall pleasantness. The ABV is also well hidden which is appreciated."
"Though not as complex or as good as some beers of this style, I'm glad to have found this one as it is quite enjoyable nonetheless. Rich and malty, with plenty of flavors, both subtle and not, this tends to showcase more of the dried [dark] fruit flavors generally found in this style - and it does it really well. I must confess, though, that I don't entirely get the whole supposed Scottish inspiration/connection with this beer, but who really cares: it is a great beer!"
"750 ml bottle, best before end 2013. Served in a tulip glass, the beer pours a murky reddish/brown color with a tan cola-like fizzy head. Head retention is good, with a decent amount of lacing. Aroma is dark fruit, brown sugar, caramel and a bit of spicyness. The brew tastes like caramel, dark fruit, nuts, bready malt, and a bit of nutmeg along with an earthy taste. There's also a slight bittersweet finish. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit creamy and is well carbonated. Drinkability is good, it's smooth and enjoyable. I think it's a good solid brew."
"As I continue to sip, the spiciness only seems to increase, and open, making this more and more enjoyable as I drink. On this night, I could not ask for better. Stellar"
"Drink - High alcohol, so eat with it but it goes down so smooth..."
"D: Very well balanced. Flavorful and not too heavy, the large bottle was a perfect serving. Enjoy it."
"Immediate taste of dark crystal malts, toasted malts, and Belgian yeast phenols. What a great combination -- the spices and cloves of a good Belgian yeast like the Chouffe strain go so well with the lightly-kilned aromatics of a Scottish ale. This beer is light on the hops, which are floral and mild, and heavy on the light and sweet caramel flavor that comes from dark caramelized sucrose. Like a good wee heavy, you are simultaneously overwhelmed by malty sweetness and looking forward to your next sip. The dark caramel malts and caramelized sugar are nearly indistinguishable, with flavors of toffee, rum, and raisins. The aromatic malts and yeast give cloves, dark spices, and a nice earthiness coming from either yeast or dry-kilned malts. The body is on the lighter side of medium due to always-appreciated sugar additions, and the color is dark and rich without being black or opaque. The head is fluffy and dense like frosting on a desert. It's the contradiction between intense flavors, sweetness, and the surprisingly light (but not dry) finish that makes the beer so damn drinkable. The phenolics will send your mind into fantasy land, and the balance will send the beer to your belly."
"In the past I've often found d'Achouffe beers to be somewhat muddled in flavour for my liking but this one is full of definition. Truly greater than the sum of its parts. Yum."
"Deep brown pour with a gigantic, rocky, tan head. Complex aroma of figs, cocoa, nuts, leather, tobacco, alcohol, fall leaves, and soft peat. A lot of that aroma gets hidden in the flavor but it still has some nice warming layers of peat, caramel, cocoa, nuts and alcohol. Dry, medium body with plentiful carbonation."
"I recently had a twelve ounce pour at the Amsterdam Ale House. There it was listed as a scottish style dark belgian (Hence the Mc). Not sure why. It basically tasted like a dark belgian. As per my review above, great for what it is but not my favorite style."
"I'm a big fan of LaChouffe, so let's see what it's other sibling has to offer. Dark brown in color with some dark red streaks at the very edges. The slight tan head clears off quickly and leaves a few small dots of lace to and fro. Aroma involves big dark fruits (cherries, grapes, figs) up front and a slight malty sweetness in the back. Tastes Vinous and sugary with a big alcohol heat in the middle. A bit of graininess exists. Goes down clean, dry and a bit thin. A Belgian Strong Dark that leaves a bit to be desired, especially when compared to it's lighter, spicier brother, but worth a try."
"D - like it a bit more than the blonde but it's a bit too simple to drink very often."
"Not too heavy, with just the right amount of taste left behind."
"D - Too sweet to session. Good for a few sips from a big bottle but I couldn't have much more."
"Textbook stuff. A lovely sunburst tobacco kind of colour. Dense head and decent lacing. Some dried fruits, baked bread, cinnamon, nutmeg. A meal in itself - quite chewy and thick (in a good way), some serious phenol action which isn't too unpleasant with a long yeasty finish. Ticks all the boxes. Yummy stuff."
"D: Nice and easy drinking, though a touch heavy. Good beer."
"Served: Aug. 2010"
"D: The beer is rather easy to drink because the alcohol is well hidden from both the smell and taste."
"D: excellent and very drinkable, good both with red meat or just by itself"
"This is the first time I've tried a second beer from the Chouffe stable (after sampling La Chouffe on countless occasions). Happy to say this did not disappoint and will look forward to (hopefully) sampling on tap when I'm in Belgium later this month."
"OVERALL: As solid a brune as their pale is a pale, though the palate is a little bigger on this one. Enjoyed this and would pick it up again at a bar or restaurant. Solid effort."
"2004 Vintage. Served from bottle into a tulip. Pours a dark brown amber with a one finger off white head. It maintains decent lacing throughout. The aroma was comprised of bananas, alcohol, malt, and brown sugar. The flavor was of fruit, massive malt, and slight alcohol. It was medium on the palate with high carbonation. Overall, this beer was excellent. Couldn't find a single thing wrong with it. It definitely aged very well if you can get ahold of an aged version you owe it to your taste buds to try it."
"D - A solid Bruin without grabbing you by the balls."
"Not bad but not something I'd rush out to get again."
"Chose this beer after touring the Achouffe Brewery in Belgium. You leave there and go a Cafe Chesar about .5 miles away for your 2 tastings included with the tour. Of all the beers we tasted while in Belgium, this was my second favorite beer behind Westvleteren 12. I love the malty, carmel, toasty aroma followed by the sweet fruit variety of tastes taste on your tongue with the smooth dry finish. I found it to be a great complex beer with changing notes as it warmed. I thought it was outstanding and since I can't get Westvleteren 12 in the States, it is my new favorite for home drinking."
"Another 'not quite what I expected' beer on a night that seemed full of them, but I really enjoyed this BSDA / dubbel hybrid, and found it ridiculously drinkable considering its ABV. A touch more heft to the flavour and this one would be competing with some of the better dubbels out there, but as it stands it seems more dubbel-Belgian strong dark lite."
"D: This was an interesting beer with a nice blend of flavors. The Belgian and Scottish styles were well integrated - almost too well because it ended up seeming more like a standard dark Belgian ale. Regardless, it had decent body (would have preferred a bit thicker), and it hid the alcohol well, so it was easy to drink. This would possibly improve with some age, but it was still enjoyable fresh."
"M & D - The mouthfeel could be a little fuller in my book but its still very nice and frothy with good CO2. Delicious offering and not bad for 8%."
"D: Yep, this one's drinkable. For a dark beer at 8% I'd have to make this either a 4 or 4.5. Probably a 4.5 actually, the sweetness is the only thing threatening this high score. 4.5"
"D: A beer I've always loved, but for some reason I've never reviewed. The late legend Michael Jackson said Scotch Ale is an institution in Belgium, with Saison de Silly and this brew I can see why. The legendary Gordon Christmas beers are still out there, and I hope to try them someday. This is really good, D'Achouffe makes consistently amazing beer."
"I'm not a big fan of dubbels in general, I'd sooner have the bigger, bolder taste of a dark strong, or else the lighter/brighter/hoppier flavours of a tripel/blonde. Regardless, this is a nice dubbel - if they are your thang, you definitely need to give this one a try."
"Notes: Outstanding!!! (IMO) I love the balance, the complexity and the feel."
"Did not blow me away. Would buy it again if I had money to spare.."
"D - Nice balance of flavors and feel make it quite drinkable."
"D-- ABV is extremly well hidden. Feels and acts so much lighter than the listed 8%. Very different smell and taste as opposed to others in this category and it does make this stand out. Nice beer and in some ways this brewery is very overlooked as a top notch brewery. Very strong line up of beers."
"Not a mindblower, but one I would welcome in my glass at any time. As noted on the back of the bottle, this is meant as a hybrid of a Scottish Ale and a more Belgian-style abbey beer. They nailed that for sure."
"M - Slightly sticky, medium bodied, decent carbonation."
"mouthfeel is adequate carbonation, clean finish, this is definetly a sipper. A really good brew that I would have no problems drinking again."
"Nose very fruity and winey enough, he reminded the grapes and prunes. It also reveals hints of sangria. The body is lighter than expected. The palate is fruity, slightly sweet, yeast and feels it is palatable for full flavor. The finish is slightly bitter and alcool warming aftertaste. A good beer that is similar to scotch ales from UK but with a touch of true Belgian."
"Mouthfeel was medium bodied. Not enough carbonation which is surprising considering this is a bottle conditioned beer."
"This beer pours murky brown and smells mildly like raisins, brown sugar, tart red fruit. It it sweet, but not cloying, with plum and and light caramel flavors. It is finely carbonated and very very smooth. In spite of being mildly sweet and 8.5%, it finishes fairly dry. I could easily drink a liter of this."
"On tap at the sierra grille in northampton. Hazy golden brown with a small head that reduces to a ring and some clouds on the top. Smell is not particularly strong. Dark fruits and some bread. Taste is belgiany spices, some dark fruits plum and raisin with a metallic finish. Medium mouthfeel. Good drink nothing outstanding."
"Ok, but @ $5.00/cdn per 500ml bottle there are several beers you can buy that are better for the same do-ray-me."
"D - Above average for a 8% beer. I had the whole 750ml bottle to myself, and started to feel the warming sensation after a while."
" D- The apple and dark sugar malts flavors are nice and full but not sweet and not much depth."
"D: A good beer overall, but resembles a thin version of the N'Ice."
"A dark brown with an appealing ivory head. Not much of an aroma. Perhaps some brown bread. Taste is excellent. Caramel, malt, brown sugar, toast. It's rich and smooth and kinda sweet. Very well balanced. Great mouthfeel and quite drinkable. All in all, not spectacular, but very very tasty."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, slightly oily and smooth with medium low carbonation."
"Drinkability: Because the beer has a very malty taste with a nice bitter after taste, it is very easy to drink."
"Pours with a lively, bubbly, loose head that erupted with smells of yeast, dark bread, mushrooms and citrus. The beer color is similar to weak coffee. Has an instantly-identifiable Belgian body: dense with a reasonable amount of fizz, and a certain quality of thickness that reflects the yeast level, I suppose. Not strong in taste, but there's still plenty to like: the aforementioned bread and mushrooms, with oranges and even some peas. A nice treat and well worth the cost."
"Overall, this is a really good example of the style and one of the better offerings I've had from Achouffe. The more beers I have from them, the more highly I think of their brewery, and this one is no exception. It has a wonderful interplay of spice and sweetness that makes for a very complex brew. What it lacks in boldness it makes up for in smoothness and drinkability. This is an excellent beer and a terrific example of the style."
"However compared to other beers in its genre, I would say it lacks a certain presence that lets you know its a true dark ale. Otherwise I could easily drink this all night.. wait. I did... and loved every minute of it."
"Overall I thought this was a good beer that wasn't quite a BSDA but obviously wasn't a BSPA. Interesting, nicely done, and worth a shot."
"D - A really solid and enjoyable Belgian Strong Dark Ale... While the name may hint at Scotch Ale tendencies, it's Brown Ale that shine through... Gains a lot of depth and complexity as this one warms... Quite quaffable... I would gladly welcome the opportunity to enjoy this brew in the future..."
"D: Seems reasonably drinkable, although the alcohol flavor and numbingness."
"I kind of feel like this is an underrated beer, but maybe age (potentially) has really evened this beer out and turned it into a really exceptional beer. I've had this before, and I don't remember being nearly this impressed. But, I wonder if it's possible that since it's pretty widely available and not too pricey, it might not be getting the hype it deserves. Of course, a B+ is a perfectly respectable score here."
"Drinkability- This beer was okay but I have had many better of the style, was definitely a slow sipper and after one I wasn't even slightly tempted to go for another with many other nice beers on tap, just a little bland, not bad but just not amazing"
"D - Very drinkable. Would definitely drink again. This beer is very enjoyable in cold weather."
"A smooth and comforting dark Belgian ale. I had this while in Amsterdam at Cafe Belgique. I had this right after trying the La Chouffe (pale ale) which was less than impressive. I prefer dark ales as a whole and this one did not disappoint. I was just drinking it by itself but think it might go well with a nice beefy meal."
"If you try this, you won't complain. There are more superior brews coming from Belgium, but nevermind that."
"Claims it's a ""new style"" abbey/scottish ale. All the way. Crafty brewing by the little gnome who, as the story goes, met himself another gnome who wore tartan. This would all be much less charming if the beer wasn't so dang tasty."
"T: Again, potent. Full-mouth unique tingly, rich, sweet, dark roasted caramel and brown sugar. That's all contrasted by bitter hops at the end. Sweet, bitter, bold, and fun!"
"Upon first opening the bottle and catching a whiff of the aroma I'd feared this beer would be far too cloying and sweet to be enjoyable. However a sip put that concern to rest and it became even more enjoyable as it warmed."
"MF&D - the feel is a bit too carbonated for the style, but the body is right. the drinkability is hampered by the amount of yest which imparts that weird bubblegum flavour."
"A pretty enjoyable, if not overly complex BSDA. The players are all there - beefy malt, yeast, spice, fruit, and simmering alcohol, sure, but I suppose I expect a certain extra je ne sais quoi, an indescribable elan, when it comes to these kinds of offerings. Unfair to most? Yep."
"Brownish amber colored beer with a slowly fading head.Aoma is fruity and spicy.Taste is dark fruits,spices and scotch.Very bland and unimpressive.There is an alcoholic warmth at the end of each drink.Overall something that was nice to try once but something I ever doubt I would buy again."
"Kind of nondescript malt, and not much more. Not bad, but nothing that really gets me excited."
"Overall: Alcohol is too much present, but in general a decent brew. However, there are so many better beers in this style. I prefer the La Chouffe by far!!"
"Drinkability: Would be better if it didnt have floating particles, but thats partly my fault. Overall, I really enjoyed this. A little experimentation is good. A Belgian-Scottish ale is a great idea, and works pretty well. Good, not cheap though."
"As advertised, an attempt to marry a Belgian to a Scotch Ale. Solid contender. Makes me want to see what else these gnomes can cook up."
"Dark sweet malty relaxing."
"D- A fine and very drinkable beer, although I prefer La Chouffe Mc Chouffe will do if the former is unavailable."
"D: Looks good, smells good and tastes good. That pretty much sums it. A better mouthfeel would put it over the top, but three out of four ain't bad. Overall, a very nice beer."
"Tastes damn close to as a good as it smells. Sort of a very pleasant mix between a Belgian Brown and a BSD. Fruit nodes are more apparent but overwhelmed by the sweet grain and chocolate complexities of the aroma, all backed up by a little kiss of alcoholic burn."
"this beer is a good value(10$canadian) and you should try it , its not amazing but well worth a try"
"A nice beer but I'm not pining for another bottle. There is some good flavour going on here but it doesn't stand up to some other brews and at 8% it does seem worth my while."
"D- Moderate. Good, solid brew, unique enough to warrant trying. Not my favorite Chouffe, but worth it, esp. if you dig the darker side of beers. Be careful, though, not like your usual Belgian (strong) Dark Ale"
"Overall, mildly complex and a bit refreshing."
"D - I'd probably drink it again but it's nothing to rave about."
"It does have a little too much of the alcohol character to be more than a sipping beer, and I think having this served to me at 11 was a really bad idea, but it's reasonably smooth, and the body is pleasantly light. Overall, a nice Belgian. I don't think it's quite as good as the better examples, but it's still very pleasant."
"As much as I'm not a huge fan of the flavour here, it's very drinkable and pleasant, goes down smoothly, because its tart and phenolic characters aren't quite sharp enough to make me recoil. Could disguise its alcohol better but otherwise pretty fine."
"The changes from harsh to mild in each sampling does not help it drinkability, however. I had two glasses for this sampling, but could not bring myself to have a third. Definitely a one-and-done beer for any particular evening."
"As with other d'Achouffe beers, this stuff is of high quality. I think it's probably my least favorite of their main beers, but being that this stuff is really tasty, that mostly speaks to the strengths of La and Houblon."
"overall a nice smooth beer with a hint of spice."
"An enjoyable ""Belgian Wee Heavy"". Nothing more to say."
"Drinkability: A reasonably pleasant, enjoyable ale, and, though the alcohol isn't entirely hidden, it isn't ever glaring, making for a relatively easy-drinking brew. Paired well with the rockin' mid-90's tunes playing at Taco Mac."
"tasted like a belgian dark ale, mixed with a little bit of scotish ale( which is pretty much what it is) the esters of the belgian yeast dominate, but you still get the malty goodness of the scotch ale. Great beer, loved it."
"T/M: Initial taste, a dry brew with a nice quick kick in the ass-end. Medium body with a creamy smoothness that disguises the alcohol bite in the back. Semi-sweet malts present as a mix of raisin and some other esters. There is almost a candy like medicinal quality in the back of your throat, but not an aftertaste."
"Good stuff"
"Very impressive. The thick mouthfeel and rich body go down greatly with the smooth carbonation. The flavor is rich and sweet, but not overpowering. Though these styles are better sipped alone, this scottish/abbey hybrid pairs well with a wide range of foods including spicy/flavorful pizza, barbecue, rich meats, and various cheeses."
"Poured out of a bottle into a Duvel glass. Pours a nice brown color with hints of red in it. Foam subsides to a minimal in a few minutes. Aroma of raisins, light brown sugar, and some caramel. Taste has more of brown sugar raisins, and light orange(?) Smooth malty finish with the belgian yeast flavor. I liked it. A Belgian version of a scotch ale. I loved it - the best of both worlds. I liked it better than most scotch ales(which is not one of my favorite styles). Will definately try again. I do want to try this on tap."
"Mouthfeel is decadently creamy, full but still a bit light, carbonation is superbly subtle - soft and creamy with just a bit of bite at the front of the mouth. Delicious, superbly crafted beer."
"Beer poured into a Duvel tulip glass. Mahogany brown in color with a reddish tint and a nice head that vanishes quickly. Beautiful lacing on the glass as I drink it. Dark fruit and spices in the nose. Beer is very smooth and drinkable. Carbonation and flavors dance all over your tongue. Flavors of malt and spices dominate the beer with some flowery hops in the finish. Very well balanced beer that got better with every sip. Bravo!"
"Pours a very dark colored body, with a big tan colored head, very quickly diminishing. Has a dusty, musky aroma, with some dark fruit. Alcoholy taste. Has a dark fruit taste, with some musk, and some alcohol. Strongish alcoholy taste. Kinda flat."
"Definitely an enjoyable Belgian strong dark ale and a must try."
"Fruity sweetness at the first sip, but after a good exhale the complexity shines through. Some nutty smoke, hazelnut perhaps, then some woody earthy molassas. Nice spice at the finish, and the alcohol makes another showing. It's a great drinker, smooth and just the right amount of belgian yeast flavors. It's a tad on the sweet cloying side, but i think that just makes it a slower drinker, i dont mind it at all."
"D: High. Well balanced tasting beer makes it easy to drink. Since the body is a bit small, it helps too. Alcohol is well hidden too."
"D- Quite drinkable but would be much better with improved carbonation"
"I had this on tap at High Street Grill. It was presented in a La Chouffe goblet, dark brown in appearance with a slight white head. The aroma was a bit sweet due to the malt, supposedly a Scotch ale hybrid I did not detect any peat aroma. It is some what sweet on the palate, coriander is also noticed. The beer is medium bodied and a bit of a sipper. Of the 4 beers I have had of this brewery this is my least favorite."
"Pours dark brown color with nice off-white head. Smell - malty fruitiness with some yeasty notes. Taste - plums-like fruitiness, maltiness. Very high carbonation, champaigne-like notes. Alcohol is very well hidden, medium bodied, very drinkable. Great session beer. Recommended"
"d - can finish the bottle very easy, because the drinkability is so pleasant"
"D= I have to admit I was disappointed by this ale. I am a huge fan of the other Chouffe beers and I also love Scottish and Scottish-inspired ales so I probably had some difficult expectations to meet. Anyway, I would drink this again if I saw it on tap just to compare but otherwise this is one I will likely skip in the future."
"Drinkability is only OK but still worth a try."
"Bottom line: I don't know how I got it but I'll likely get more of it."
"Overall, a wonderful beer, certainly one that I would buy again. Pleased to be able to drink it in a McChouffe logo tulip - one I had bought years ago but had never gotten around to filling with its namesake."
"D: A good dark belgian, maybe not as complex as some of the better ones, but still worth trying."
"D - Good that the alcohol dissipates from the nose. An interesting quaff as a Belgian takes on West coast hops."
"The nutty yeast is a nice touch and the sugary start/spicy finish is very pleasing. Somewhat refreshing. However, it has a fairly thin body and while it is an enjoying sipper, it is not something I would actively seek out. Solid brew, just I feel that something is lacking in the taste/aroma department for a Belgian dark."
"Pours murky brown with a medium-sized tan head. Lots of molasses, yeast, dark fruits, candi sugar, and grapes in the nose. Great taste. Funny how the Scotch ale qualities compliment the Belgian strong ale qualities. Sweet caramel and banana flavors. Fair amount of licorice, toffee, and raisin. The funk comes through in the end with a earthy/wood quality. Good stuff."
"D - Easy-driking and a definite sipper due to the ABV. Would have liked more of a prominent flavor. Very thin in my opinion compared to others."
"nice chestnut brown in the glass with a fluffy off white head however there are a lot of floaters in this beer even with a careful pour more than I would expect anyway. The smell is of Belgian yeast phenolics with a bit of peppery spice and alcoholic pepper, slightly stale and musty in the background. The taste is reminiscent of a typical English brown ale a lot of chocolate and toffee and a slight nuttiness blended with the yeast character of spice and earthiness weak for a Belgian strong dark ale but not bad for a brown ale. The mouthfeel is slightly thin the finish is fairly clean slightly sweet with a touch of spice from the alcohol. Drinkability for this beer is quite good the flavors blend well and the smoothness is refreshing and rather delightful."
"Had this with the Turkey dinner on Thanksgiving. Perfect compliment to dark meat and gravy. It had a nice fluffy head. It was spicy and fruity. Pepper and phenols you would expect from a Belgian. It was suprisingly a little thin with the mouthfeel. I didn't find this a fault though because it hid the alcohol and added to the drinkability. The thinness made it slightly refreshing and the caramel and slight choc coupled with the spice made it a great drink. Great balance of complex flavors and drinkability."
"An overall pleasant Belgian, not something I would actively seek out again though."
"This sweetness carries on to the palate and is a touch cloying towards the end. Alcohol is very evident. Medium carbonation."
"Pours brown and hazy with a decent head. Not much lacing in my glass, but there's enough carbonation to last through the drink. I absolutely loved the smell of this, chocolatey, with some sweet fruits from the yeast and subtle hop profile. The taste is just what I expected - sweet and malty, not much hops (at least in the sense we Americans seem to think of them) to speak of, but I think they support the beer well, saaz and goldings is what the bottle says, to give it a bit of fruitiness to compliment the sweetness. It may be the 750 mL bottle, or the 8% alcohol, but I wouldn't drink more than one of these, though I did enjoy drinking the one I had."
"HIGHLY drinkable, and dangerous at 8%. Could be a little more complex, but that makes it go down quick. High acidity would make it great with food."
"Overall, a solid entry in this style. This has become one of my favorite beer styles, and this is a nice to to have tried."
"11.2oz. bottle served in my DT snifter. Best before end of 2007 indicated on the bottle. Poured the color of cola with a 1.5 inch loose, fluffy, off-white head that sizzled and popped as it receded. Some strands of sticky, random lacing present during the tasting. Nose is somewhat vinous and yeasty with a hint of oak - nose might be a little off. Flavor profile is difficult to describe - muted candi sugar, a little herbal, a little vinous, earthy/woody/must. Mouthfeel falls somewhere between light- and medium-bodied with a consistent background carbonation present from sip to swallow with a light, lingering burn at the back of the throat. Finish is on the dry side. Fair drinkability. Not sure if it's past it's prime, but it was interesting to say the least. Might need to re-compare with a more contemparary vintage."
"Great stuff!"
"Pours a dark auburn brown with some clarity and a two-finger head that dies quickly and leaves some lacing. Some malts in the smell and they contain a little sweetness; cocoa, caramel; only hints of dark fruit. First thing that hit me was a dryer, nuttier taste. Still, it is somewhat sweet and smooth over the tongue despite a little syrupy stickiness and it is almost full bodied (thanks to decent carbonation). There are figs and some roasted malts as well, plus a dark fruit sensation although it finishes dry. ABV hidden well - a good beer to relax with."
"Â¡Salud!"
"Drinkability: Rather enjoyable, but definitely on the sweet side"
"Drinks pretty easy for the ABV, although the booze does peak through a bit. This was better on draft across from the brewery! Not bad, but there are better Belgian darks out there"
"I'd been eyeing this one at the store and then it appeared on tap at American Flatbread so... off the tap the beer came to me a deep garnet color leaning towards brown. The tan head was about a finger thick and retained very well. Gorgeous curtains of lacing. The aroma was truly a bouquet like a florists shop with lots of sweet malt, citrus and aromatic hops. The flavors were also good, citrus candy, tropical fruit, berries and some hops though the malt profile is a little subdued. Alcohol heat appeared as it warmed up but otherwise it was well concealed. The carbonation was just a little prickly but generally it was clean and easy to drink. Yum!"
"Drinkability is there but I'm just not enjoying this as much as I want to. With some aging, I bet the flavors will come out more."
"Drinkability: Not bad but not my favorite of the style."
"Drinkability is pretty good. As mentioned in taste, all around this beer is very rich. So it will go well with a shepard`s pie or other hearty meals."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability: Medium in body, seems a bit lighter than a Belgian Strong Dark should be, but that's just my opinion. Low and delicate carbonation, so low that when drinking this beer its not noticed until its thought about, until one is looking for it...I like that, subtle. Pretty much average all around. This is one I""d not be opposed to drinking again, but there are many others that are much better. Easy to drink, but again, pretty much average."
"Drinkability: A little heavy after a while, but nice."
"Mmmm, mmmm, good. Nice brown color with hints of a deep red when held to the light. Smells a little malty but the taste! Ah! The taste! The taste! Excellent, to be exact. Slightly sweet at the start and then finishes with a nice hoppy note. And really, is it possible to go wrong with a beer championing gnomes on the bottle? Certainly not!"
"Shared a 750mL bottle with a friendly Antwerp(en?) at Kulminator. Served in a McChouffe branded glass. Dark brown, moderately translucent look, head is tan and doesn't stick around. Malty aromas, bit of spice, caramel, etc. Sooo easy to drink, very dangerous, we slid back quite a bit at the bar.. well balanced and carbonated to ease it down. Classic Belgo."
"Not a bad choice, but not something I'll seek out again. The other offerings I've had from chouffe have been much stronger IMO."
"Taste is light, notes of molasses and caramel coloring, which a little astringent. There is a slight warming feeling to the beer, despite it's insane drinkability. The yeast adds a great profile and is herbal and peppery. The absence of caramalt, as confirmed by the brewery itself, creates a beer that lacks the extra bit of depth that a BSDA needs."
"The good ole Chouffe gnomes have done it again; brewed a delicious drink of a beer that is. Earthy colors with thick head that stays around for a while, what a good brown ale should look like. Not too overpowering of a smell but rather a soothing cocoa bean aroma. Mmmm, smooth, malty, coffee roast with a touch of chocolate spice for an aftertaste and I am transported to Belgium hanging out with midgets. No alcoholic bite to be found despite the 8.0% ABV, it is masked behind the deep flavors that coat the tongue. A tasty Belgian mudslide that's enjoyable any time of year."
"D, notes: This is a top shelf beer. It's heavy so its sessionability is limited but this is a great sipping beer."
"A bit too sweet for my palate, but definitely not offensive. A decent brew."
"D: An incredibly smooth and silky Belgian brown that went down effortlessly. Very good drinkability."
"D - In spades, perhaps too drinkable! I can see this being swirled down year 'round with no problem. Cheers!"
"This one pours a rich, almost opaque chocolaty brown. Aroma is strong and malty and just a touch sweet. Flavor is rich, remarkably sweet but not cloying, strongly malty with hints of fruit and butterscotch and a nutty trace. There is just a tiny hit of hop bitterness. Very smooth and pleasant to sip."
"D - Not your standard Belgian Dark, nevertheless, this drinks beautifully. Kick back, relax and enjoy the contents of the 750ml bottle. This cross between BSDA and Scottish Ale is not as daring an idea as the Houblon Chouffe, but the deft touch of a master artisan brewer is still quite evident here. You can't go wrong with Brasserie d'Achouffe."
"D = A good drinkable beer for a relaxing evening."
"McChouffe is a very nice beer. BSDA or Belgian Brown as the bottle claims, I don't really know? I do know that it has a great nose, a nice tasty balance, and a classic mouthfeel. Well done."
"Pretty good drinkability. Another enjoyable beer from the guys at d'Achouffe."
"Overall an easy drinking brew."
"($7.99 / 25.4 oz. / 75 cl tall green lithographed champagne style bottle - capped)"
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, good kick, good representation of style, this one isn't one of my favorites but it's a good beer that is worth sipping for a while."
"Ah, McChouffe. One of my first Belgians I ever had, and it still holds up. Pours a murky brown with a strong head. Smell is very sweet; sugar and malt mainly. Drinking this beer is like drinking subdued caramelized brown sugar. A very satisfying brew. Absolutely outstanding!"
"D: The beer drinks extremely easily. I was almost ashamed to look at the glass when I was finished tasting if for the review as it was empty and it had only been five minutes."
"M- Silky, weighty and very pleasant. A 750 ml bottle is a good serving choice alone or with a buddy."
"Poured dak earhty/reddish brown with a creamy off white head on top. Looks nice. Smells of earth and spices with sweet tones in as well. Tasted sweet mild caramel malt at first but phenols and peppery flavors were very present. Also had a fruity flavor of darker fruits but not a dark fruit cake flavor. Mouthfeel was creamy but still ahd good carbonation and I know I could drink a few of these. I'm really starting to enjoy Belgian Dark Ales and this one is tasty."
"D: nice belgian ale, good taste, good aftertaste. nice ale"
"Drinkability- While drinking this I found it hard on the 'drink a lot of this beer' scale. Many Belgians are like this but this one was a little high on the yeast content making it that much more difficult. 8.0% ABV also makes this one pretty hard to session."
"D - This tastes great, but it was alot to drink in one sitting. Next time I should share it with a fellow BA."
"750 ML green belgian bottle purchased from Gary's in Madison... Pours a dark-brown and slightly purple hue with minimal head that left distinct lacing... smell was replete with currants, raisins, caramel, and dark brown sugars... slight alcoholic aroma is also noticeable...This artisinal Belgian brewery produces some pretty fine quality beers, and this one certainly fits the bill, complete with quality, character, and substance... taste is very complex and intricate, with a nice combination of figs, prunes, raisins, and noticeable malts and caramel... dehydrated fruits are also noticeable, and the malt factor really pours through... mouthfeel wasn't as rich or thick as some other samples from Brasserie d'Achouffe, but this one was still satisfying, with an extremely easy drinkability despite the 8% ABV which is more detectable in the nose than in the mouth... good stuff and an interesting depiction of the style... Recommended..."
"I'm not sure exactly what the ""Mc"" denotes, and I'll admit, I'm not inspired to do the homework to find out. I don't like it as much as La Chouffe, though I wouldn't kick this one off the bar either. The ABV is not as big as its announced presence might lead one to believe, but it's certainly worth of note. So this may not be the first Brasserie d'Achouffe offering I'll reach for, but failing other options, I'd not be too disappointed."
"Out of a 750ml capped bottle. Pours a mud puddle brown color with an average cream colored head that left a sparse cap. The smell is of bready malt, some typical Belgian spice/yeast aroma. Has a slightly dark fruit scent as well. The taste starts off with an earthy Beligan yeast flavor, there is a hint of candi sugar sweetness, not much of a fruity flavor as there is a woody flavor. Rounds out nicely with a slighty bitter end. The feel is moderate with tingly carbonation and finishes well balanced. This doesn't feel like a big beer at all, quite sessionable. The taste doesn't blow me away but it sure does drink easy."
"You can see through the clear mahogany colored darkness. A gentle pour yields a huge fizzy light tan head that resists fading and settles to surface leaving a spotty lacing pattern. The smell has that earthy Belgian yeast with brown sugar, graham cracker and a little caramel. Nicely carbonated, the mouth feel is light and effervescent. The taste is interesting as well. I like the association to a Scottish Abbey Ale. The flavors are similar to the aroma. There is a light after taste, almost like a cola, with the spicy note of a Scotch Style that lingers nicely. I'm already seeing signs of wide interpretation with this style. A decent drinker; the 8% ABV is warming. Cheers!"
" Like all of the craft beers and imports that I've enjoyed in the past, this one is definitely a keeper. I'm going to buy a bottle of each and cellar them to see how they improve with age."
"750ml green bottle from The Lighthouse in Manchester. Pours a slightly hazy copper-brown with a good inch of light tan head. Smells fruity - grape, cherry, citrus - with hints of caramel, chocolate, and smoke. Tastes fruity also, with strong roasty chocolate and caramel, with hints of peatiness. Slight alcohol warming toward the finish, though it is less noticeable with the vigorous carbonation. On the lighter side of medium-bodied. Very very drinkable and extremely tasty. Nothing wrong with this one IMO. One of the best Belgian darks I've had in quite some time."
"D - Very drinkable - pungently fruity without being heavy, well balanced and tasty."
"I will only buy this brew again simply to see if this review was overly negative, or to share a ""training-wheels Belgian"" with micro noob."
"I wish everyone a happy 2008!"
"has an exceptional color, a beatiful ruby color without hardly any head, the smell is really good, citrus and yeasty wonderfullness. has a strong alcohol note to it, but the taste is awesome, i really enjoy it mouthfeel is full and good. the drinkability is very high, a good beer like this without a crazy price.. belgians might be the best thing ever."
"Pours a clear, but dark, ruby. Some tan head. Nose is slightly sweet with a fruit edge. Flavor is mild with a strong sweet tone that has hints of a slight spice and a barely noticeable alcohol tone on the end. Feel has a slightly thicker bubble on it. Easily drinkable."
"Not offensive, but utterly devoid of character. A hint of sweet malts to taste and the slightest whiff of alcohol in the nose, but after that, almost a non-beer. Packs a bit of a punch with a high alcohol content, so good for a quiet buzz I suppose, but not something you would drink to savour in any way. Good to wash down a sandwich I guess. Certainly not like anything I'm reading about below ..."
"This seems like a nice sipping beer for a cool fall day. I am not generally a fan, but I found this quite drinkable, if somewhat high in alcohol taste. Not heavy - all flavor. 4.20 overall."
"Pours dark mahogany with a good head with lacing. Dark fruits, malts, caramel, and alcohol are in the nose, which follows into well balanced flavors of sweetness (fruits and malts), spice (nutmeg and something?), and bitterness (hops and alcohol). Easy drinker for the style and ABV, highly recommended."
"Just like irish stouts and belgian strongs, nothing is quite like a scotch ale from scotland. But one the closest is mcchouffe. technically its a belgian scotch style winter ale, but it is quite good. the scotch ale flavors come out but are a little hidden by hop flavors and excessive carbonation. sips a little abrasive as I think it is overcarbonated and feels watery for a scotch style, but it does have the warming effect of a wee heavy or a winter ale. This is good beer, but not quite accurate to its claimed style, but a good valiant attempt. worth buying"
"Mouthfeel is actually quite nice, thick and almost meaty but not too chewy. I like it. As far as drinkability, well, after I got past the initial shock of the off-flavor, I think I can finish this. But I get the feeling I may have grabbed the wrong bottle. I don't know what could have caused this, but I really like all the other Chouffe beers, so I am prepared to call this one an anomaly and try it again...but for now I can only judge it on what I have in front of me. Not so great."
"Easily drinkable and mellow with an interesting malty taste. The nose is rather grainy and even ""stinky."" There's a subtle element of the taste that seems a bit out of place but this is somehow subsumed within the other flavors. It could use a bit more carbonation, I think. In any event it tastes unique and I'm enjoying it."
"Light-medium in body, smooth and creamy. Good carbonation. Great drinkability, enjoyable, and a very interesting beer."
"Review translated from french 5/7/9."
"Ok, that sounds a little bad, but it tastes like dandelion or some similar plant was thrown in the pot. Spice aside, the malt follows that of a scotch ale with with sweet roasted caramel and chocolate. I can't tell if there's any smoked malt, but I wouldn't put it past this beer to have a little. Worth a try if you want an odd twist on the classic brown abbey ale."
"Opinion: This is a pretty good beer. It is what it is...a Belgian Scottish Ale. It definitely has a lot of Wee Heavy character, and thankfully has a lack of the floral Belgian yeast character that would ruin this presentation. I like the Scottish styles, so I would certainly try this beer again as it is in that realm."
"Very light mouthfeel. Not viscous at all. Rather thin, but nice."
"I find it hard to believe I liked this more than LaChouffe. The lower carbonation and deeper flavor put this one even a step above it. I will be having this one again."
"D - A very drinkable brew I could have several in a night. I enjoyed the last sip as much as the first"
"i can taste the ""mc..."" but it's not definitive. i would suggest, however, that this beer was fermented fairly cool for a belgian. the flavor is quite malty. ok, so this does seem alot like a wee heavy fermented with a belgian yeast"
"D--This is pretty good beer, if you enjoy belgians like me, this is definitely worth a try"
"This would be an excellent brew if the flavors were a little more bold. Mcchouffe is a hybrid Scotch/Abbey ale but the flavors are much weaker than what I'd expect from either of those styles."
"McChouffe pours a clear light brown with a foamy head that doesn't linger. The aroma is slightly metallic caramel and roasted malts, not a lot of hops and some fruity, yeasty esters. The flavor is slightly sour and bitter up front, giving way to sweet dark fruity malt. There is some yeast flavor but its in the background. Creamy and smooth, there is a hint of alcohol flavor, but not too much, the beer is a smooth 8.5 %."
"$3 at Maduro in a McChouffe glass."
"Green capped 750ml bottle poured into a Duvel tulip glass. Pours a dark and murky brown color with a light tan head. The aroma is malty with some dark fruit and a touch of spices. The taste is pretty complex with some dark fruits and a nice dry and spicy finish. Mouthfeel is light bodied and heavily carbonated. Overall, this is a tasty brew that is recommended."
"Overall: I need to sample this beer againÂ…and againÂ…and again."
"good for me to sip on it over an hour with food and water. Signing off here... (still pretty tipsy)"
"D: Served way too cold, I think. Muted the aroma too much. But thatÂ’s no fault of the beer. Liked it once I let it sit for a while."
"Another nice brew from Beligium (though doesn't quite stand up to La Chouffe and other some other Belgians that come to mind - nice, but a tad too sweet, IMO.)"
"The beer pours an orange brown color with very good head retention and good lacing. The nose is a bit backward initially, but one gets a hint of sweetness and Belgium spices. Smells quite enticing actually. On the palate this is a very nice beer indeed. I get some milk chocolate, citrus and a hint of cherry. There is also a bit of tartness, which keeps the sweetness at bay and keeps the beer from becoming tiring to drink The beer has a nice plush mouthfeel to it, and the abv. is well disguised. It comes across as quite drinkable, and frankly was too soon gone before I noticed it. A very nice offering Brasserie d'Achouffe."
"or aperitif situation"
"Drinkability - Good. I really enjoyed this beer. At 11 bucks a bottle its a little pricey to drink often, but I wouldn't turn it down. I just wish it came in a regular sized bottle."
"As is typical for a BSDA (or a Wee Heavy for that matter), not super-drinkable owing to the ABV and the sweetness."
"D - It tastes like fricking cigarettes! Come on!! This is just absurd. I guess I see why they have the Scottish element. If you coat anything with cigarettes it suddenly earns the qualifier of ""Scottish."" Ridiculous. Did I mention that I hate cigarettes?"
"overall- Very solid belgian. Lacks the complexity of others (st.bernardus 12) but makes up for it with a nice clear flavor."
"Cheers!"
"Was able to give this brew a try last evening as I absolutely enjoyed the NÂ’Ice Chouffe during the holidays. Once again I was very impressed with the offering. Brew poured to a nice vibrant brown color with a perfect sized head that filled the tulip glass to its rim. The head had a cream color to it, maybe even hedging on tan with good retention and a nice amount of sheeting lace. The aromaÂ’s where very enticing, molasses, brown sugar, nutÂ’s and dark fruit to name as many as I can remember. The taste was similar to the aromas that where mentioned along with a nice hop taste that adds to the pallet. This is a very nice sipping brew, not due to the alcohol (8%), which is actually hard to notice, but due to the complexity of the flavors that where noticed. This was a great brew and one of the highlights of the evening."
"Not sure how well the classification fits, but it's a good beer regardless"
"The taste is quite delicious, there's a delightful caramel sweetness to it. It has a smooth and medium body. I'm thrilled that it comes in a 750 mL bottle because I know I want more."
"D: Excellent. Could have a few. Very smooth. Alcohol was non-present, which could sneak up on you if you have a few. A good beer from a great brewery."
"D: This brew is made with elfin goodness, are these the same elves that work for keebler? A great beer and very smooth you don,t even notice the 8.5abv until you finish the 25oz. bottle. I liked this brew a lot. I would recommend this Belgian to try for yourself if you can pick it up."
"It generally tastes quite generic although very diferent than many of its dark ale brothers and is perhaps a tad over-carbonated, as well as watery."
"The taste is both complex and well balanced, with subtle creamy malt and a raisiny plum and sour mash blend that lets you know the hops are in effect. Exceptional mouthfeel, semi-thick and bubbly up front and across the palate, leaves a slight hoppy aftertaste. Great carbonation. There's a lot going on in this beer to keep your tastebuds happy...definately recommended by this reviewer."
"Cheers!"
"Overall: A good, mellow, yet overall unremarkable Belgian brown."
"Pours a clear dark brown/ruby red with a giant tan foamy head. The head is huge and lasts forever leaving fantastic lacing. The smell is pungent with bready scents along with alcohol, sweet malt, candy sugar,and chocolate. The taste has aton of carbonation along with a ""bisquity' flavor along with alcohol, alot of candy sugar and some dark fruit. The m/f is medium with all flavors mixing well. A damn good beer that should not be missed. You can't go wrong with this brewery.Cheers."
"This is a special Belgian. 1pt, 9.4oz bottle at 8.5% and well worth the purchase. Using a deep tulip glass, it pours a lovely dark chestnut brown with an ample tan head. Moderate carbonation. Hints of sugary sweet chocolate in the aroma. Malty, chocolatey taste with a smooth yet hearty mouthfeel which carries through to finish. Lace hugs the glass throughout the experience. Highly drinkable. A wonderful Belgian brown."
"This beer got better as it went along. Poured to a hazy brown with hints of orange. Aroma was apples and a hint of malt. As the glass warmed, the alcohol crept in to nicely round out the aroma. Flavor was good, though nothing really dominated, although hints of spice, possibly cinnamon, were evident. Mouthfeel was spicy, and the finish was smooth and somewhat warming. Not a bad beer."
"Give me more. Very enjoyable complex offerring. I will be adding others from the brewery after finishing this."
"D: This is like a Belgian take on Newcastle, but much better. Its very simplistic but tasty none the less."
"Mouthfeel is rich without being heavy and drinkability is very good. Not quite a session beer because of the 8.5, but a few of these with good friends and without having to drive afterwards would be a good evening."
"A pleasant and drinkable Belgian, but with a rather ordinary flavor compared to others in this style. Still, I had no problems consuming the entire bottle..."
"It was very earthy and mild, overall. The alcohol is well hidden considering the strength and for that it's impressive. Something that I may grab on a cold winter night by the fire."
"I'm becoming a big fan of Brasserie D'Achouffe! This was a very nice beer!"
"Drinkability: I would definetly get it again very drinkable, very delicious."
"I am sure I have had this beer before, when in Brussels, years ago, and enjoyed it, sadly, this review doesn't reflect that memory, only what I had tonight."
"Overall Impression: A nice beer. It has a strong grape soda element to it that is enjoyable, but gets to be a bit much in the bomber. The more I drank and to warmer it (and I) got, the more Rochefort qualities came out. IÂ’m impressed with this one and would suggest it."
"Lightly syrupy, medium bodied and well carbonated, this has a pleasing mouthfeel. A highly drinkable Belgian dark ale."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability; the mouthfeel is medium bodied with a very smooth but active carbonation, and the drinkability is just great. I'm having a hard time putting down my glass."
"The beer tastes very sweetÂ…very much like a wee-heavy but with some interesting spice in the aftertaste. The mouthfeel is a little on the thin side but this doesnÂ’t seem to detract from the beer. I would highly recommend this beer and I am interested in sampling some of the breweryÂ’s other styles."
"D: For a relatively big beer, this is supremely drinkable, would make for a lively and short session. Good Stuff."
"D: I have no idea what an ""Artisanal Belgian Brown Ale"" is, and I've read quite a bit on Belgian beer. But categories be damned, this is a really nice beer. I haven't had too much from this brewery, but what I've had has been very, very good. I'll be going back to this beer, for sure."
" Wavz"
"This is a solid beer. Nothing outstanding but very reliable."
"Drinkability: Absolutely wonderful stuff, and it makes me love the style even more, as I can't get enough. It never ceases to amaze me how nuanced some of these brews in the style are, and this is surely one of them without a doubt. Looks like I'll be getting as much from the brewery as I can to see if any can match this. I've seen them, but I was always hesitant for some reason to pick up more. Things are gonna change now."
"This is a very tasty treat. Certainly worth seeking out."
"Very drinkable, a tasty belgian treat I will look forward totrying again."
"Overall, this is a decent brown ale in all categories except for its superb nuttiness and curious sourness. It has decent drinkability and a very good mouthfeel. Recommended."
"This beer poured a dark, cloudy brown with a tan head. The smell was malty and slightly sour. It has a definite malt taste, but was more delicate than expected This was a full bodied beer but not heavy. I've taken delight in every drop of this brew."
"Another good beer from an outstanding brewery. Gotta love those gnomes!"
"Body is ruby and brown with an intense head that looks like silk foam. It has to be about 3 fingers worth. Artisanal lacing coats the glass with every sip. Nose is a bit floral and very sugary. It smells good but I do wish there was more going on. Taste is the sugar of pear juice, a bit of smokey caramel, and maybe some dark fruit. Pretty nice. Mouth is punctuated by delicate carbonation that hits here and there and feels creamy. In all, I've never met a Chouffe that I didn't like and this one begs to be bought again."
"Overall, very drinkable. Quite smooth and wonderful tasting. The ABV is hidden quite well."
"Very interesting and complex. In my opinion, better on tap than in the bottle."
"Dark brown with dense tan lacing that (mostly) fades quickly. Looks great, in short. Smells a bit acidic, with only a hint of caramel in the background. Taste is much better, with notes of caramel and rasins. The aftertaste is a bit metallic, echoing the acidic smell. Mouthfeel is very good, with good carbonation & lots of small bubbles adding interest to the silky overall texture. Drinkability is good, although the aftertaste may wear on me before too long. Overall, a very good, though not great, beer."
"Drinkability/Overall: smooths out as it warms, still not as balanced as some of the previous browns/darks in the session. Still a well-made, complex brown that nicely complements its brother, LaCouffe's, fruity lightness."
"Drinkability: A nice dark ale with some signature d'Achouffe notes and spices. From the bottle, the malts were a little subdued giving this some ""flat"" moments. But certainly worth checking out."
"Poured into a Chimay chalice, this beer is a translucent orange-brown, raising a rocky light tan head. The color is a marvel, very rich and inviting. So is the smell, being entirely sweet malty caramel. The taste begins the same way, albeit more intensely, and accompanied by roastiness and hints of cocoa. It then moves to a slight, short biscuit phase. ending on a juicy-sweet note, which is slightly citric. In the mouth, it's medium-thick, and carbonated enough to be nice and tingly. Overall, I rate this so highly because it's complex, sweet without being cloying, and very warming. A most enjoyable Belgian melding of the Scottish tradition."
"Mouthfeel is medium, not real heavy, could pass for a dubbel. Nice and drinkable Belgian brew, the text on the label (besides the name) leads me to believe this may have some Scottish influence but it isn't obvious. Good but not exceptional."
"Lots of good flavors here, but overall, they don't work together real well. I find it vaguely...disappointing."
"""McChouffe""...hummm. I wonder if they have been sued by McDonald's yet? Call it what they want--this is great beer! A style-typical dark malt color with browns, rubies, mohogany colors that swirl around a mild haze. Firm and fluffy carbonation that deserves a '5'. Smells candy sweet and fruity fresh with an underlying berry tartness, hoppy spiciness, and vineous alcohol. Flavors unlock the same character but with more power that the aroma suggests. Fruity with dates, figs, grapes, blackberries, and a hint of raisons. Sweet with a light molassas, cotton-candy, candied sugar flavor. Hopped / spiced with a peppery, earthy, musky, nutty character. Throw in a bit of red-wine just for good measure. The beer feels full, but light (carbonated) in the mouth. Mildly prickling and numbing. Leaves the mouth a bit sticky sweet, but not off-putting. This is indeed a super beer!"
"This was a 11.2 ounce bottle with a cool screenprinted hunchback guy on it. It poured a gorgeous orange amber with a huge cratery tan head. The body was hazy and had a moderate amount of junk floating around in it. Very carbonated. The aroma was mostly of apple and pear to me mixed with some darker fuits and a kinda of medicinal smell. This smelled like it was going to be a yeasty delight. The taste came through with lots of dark fruity flavors. Incredibly rich but not bitey. The mouthfeel is quite full; Thick and slick. This is incredibly drinkable. The alcohol is barely noticeable but there is enough to warm you up nicely. Overall this was a little too carbonated but still quite intriguing."
"Very drinkable, and sharable with a 750ml bottle. Another well done brew. I'm sure anyone who enjoys belgians in the least bit would enjoy this one."
"This is a beer I was expecting far less. It seemed gimicky to me, but this beer is very flavorful and enjoyable."
"I must say, this began much ""brighter"" than it concluded. Poured a cloudy brown orange colour with plenty of debris, as expected. Foamy khaki head with loosely knit bubbles, subsided to a blanket of frost in about 60 seconds. The smell was exceptionally fruity and malty. Smelled delicious. Plenty of stewed fruits and raisins. Then came the taste. It was decent, I suppose. Not very complex, and no one flavour profile really captivated me. I thought it was rather boring and simply an average Belgian at best. I also thought it had a bit too much carbonation. The mouthfeel wasn't smooth and seamless, as I had expected. Instead, it was abrasive and almost offensively carbonated. Good thing this was given to me and I didn't have to pay for it."
"I'm told that this is Chouffe's take on Scotch Ale, which admittedly I don't know much about. This is good, I wish I knew how faithful to style it was."
"D - Nice enough and not as much going on as others in the style. Certainly drinkable."
"The 8% alcohol is well hidden behind the sweetness. Pretty easy drinking and pretty smooth but over all I found this to be pretty average, if not lacking, for a Belgian strong dark ale."
"This is a very interesting belgian ale. A little confusing overall but maybe its supposed to be. Crazy gnomes..."
"Definitely good, and great if you love dry spicey hops. Aroma is mild but you can certainly pick out yummy things in it. Taste is different from any other versions of this style I've had and I like it. Nice."
"Small bottle, allowed to warm up, out of the fridge for about 30 mins. ""best before end of 2006"" printed onto the bottle. Pours dark auburn, murky with a HUGE thick, creamy and long lasting head Leaving oodles of thick and sticky lacing and sheeting. Malted milk, peat, alcohol on the nose. Bold and smooth brew. Smoky, malty notes of more peat, earthy, slight soapyness. Nice dark brew from d'Achouffe. Well worth picking up some of this widely available brew and enjoying with a hearty meal."
"The beer poured a dark amber with a respectable tan head. The aroma was simply of good malt. The taste was very light malt a tad sweet. The feel was medium and dry. The label declares this a scotch belgian cross for me it just doesn't work. You basically took two things I love and combined them to give me something that weakly resembled both at times, but did nothing to make me go this is good."
"Pretty tiny bubble lacing. Dark mahogany brown. Aroma offers soft complexity. A number of different features are tasted in the mouth. Soft backbone of Belgian yeast, on first thought this is a bruin. Some notes of toffee. No alcohol, some warming. Medium lingering. Not positive I taste Scotch notes, this is far too light. There is however some gentle liquere like notes as it warms. A very sweet brew. Perhaps some Belgian sugar in there? A gentle balance overall and very enjoyable. Against others similar to it, this beer sadly doesn't offer as much to celebrate - not the same level of strength, depth, or complexity. On its own however, this is a lovely beer - very easy going, light and most defintely enjoyable"
"Poured from the 750ml capped bottle into my La Chouffe tulip glass. Brownish-ruby body is topped by a huge, foamy tan head that disippates into a good one-finger or so after a couple of minutes. Good carbonation. Aroma of some lightly sweet, medium-bodied malt, tasty Chouffe Belgian yeast, and an underlying clove spiciness. Palate features the dueling influences of some rich, lightly roasted caramel malt, a bit of Euro hops, and the somewhat overpowering yeast. Notes of clove, white pepper, biscuit, and a touch of caramel. Massive alcohol presence on the finish leads to a nice warming sensation all the way down the throat. Nice, medium body is not too fizzy and conveys the flavor quite well. I was, um, forced to finish the 750 bottle by myself. Not like it was punishment."
"Taste is bland. Teetering on boring. Some alcoholness, some dark ripe fruits- but you have to dig for it. Just... bland. Mouthfeel is full and sudsy- the best part of this brew, in my opinion. A good feel. Fairly drinkable, especially considering the alcohol content. But this did not live up to the hype. Meh."
"Spicy aroma with brown sugar notes. Brown with a fat white head that faded fast. Grassy, yeasty and ample spice. No real smokiness for a scoth ale..even if it is a Belgian attempt at one. Comes across as a less gassy version of a belgian strong ale (as it is listed here) with less spice and sweetness. Different and fun to drink, but not a world beater."
"Pours a beautiful big head that falls into a small persestant head and leaves a strong lacing in it's path. The color is dark and burgandy-purple, very hard to see through. Smell is sour with dark fruit tones. You can smell the Belgian very nicely. The taste is not overpowering, it's delightful. It feels like silk in my mouth and leaves a wonderful aftertaste. I really enjoyed this beer."
"Great mouthfeel. Alcohol is warming. I can actually feel the heat of the alcohol. Perfect carbonation. Meduim to full bodied. A very nice example of the style. I cant wait to try McChouffe's cousin LaChouffe; she now resides in the back of my refrigerator tempting me every time I open the door."
"Another fine offering from d'Achouffe."
"Saw this eer in the store. Am looking forward to their upcoming Tripel, thought this would be fun to try. It was a medium brown color with a thick white head. It had a malty caramel odor and a sweet taste with some spice in the background. Felt OK in the mouth. I thought it was a good, but not great beer"
"This offering poured with a frizzy, tan, and quickly dissipating head but that doesn't rob from the fact that it was mountainous to start. A true deep brown color preserves. The nose is inviting, as its fresh, bready, with a spicy pepperness. The body is medium with a spicy and tad prickly mouthfeel. There is a very fresh feel to the beer. Among the mingling flavors are cloves, nuttiness, and saaz(?) hops. Overall, a very earthen and handcrafted feel, which is always appreciated. I'm floored at how the complexity keeps the mouth refreshed. The finish is very peppery, with sweet clove, and is not entirely bitter. Very drinkable overall and is a good experience."
"this is smooth and easy to drink. listed here at 8%, the bottle says 8,5%. overall not bad, but not a lot of character by itself. great with a sharp cheese."
"D - A great tasting dark ale that satisfies to the last drop. Not overly complex, but maybe a nice intro into the world of Belgian beers. Alcohol doesn't hit you hard at all."
"Presented in a LaChouffe tulip. A 3/4"" tan head over the light brown brew, with ample lacing. Aroma is sweet malts, with spiciness and light alcohol notes apparent. Taste follows the nose, with the spiciness and sweetness balancing each other, and light alcohol warming. Mouthfeel and drinkability were both excellent, I look forward to enjoying this brew again."
"Had this one on tap at the East Point Corner Tavern (on tap)! It pours a murky brown color with a very bubbly massive head that laces nicely in the McChouffe snifter. It has a nice floral and fruity aroma. The taste is sweet but not overpowering and has a slight warming quality. It has a slightly fizzy and full mouthfeel. It has a very drinkable quality; I could get trashed easily on this drinking it like ginger ale. Very smooth and very drinkable."
"This is a Belgian beer for people who think they don't like Belgian beers. Lots of everything, and nothing to excess. Funky, fruity yeast flavors well melded with moderately tart Flanders sourness, and then some nice malt to hold everything in check. Had this with a ""ploughman's supper"" of sorts - cured meat, sharp cheese and chewy bread - an it went with it better than about anything I can think of. This may find its way into the dedicated beer fridge with some regularity."
"Poured from a 750ml bottlecapped bottle. Pours a chestnut brown with a 1 1/2 finger head with OK longevity and good lace. Smells of deep caramel malt and candy sugar with hints of vanilla and fruit. Tatse of Heavy malt again with candy sugar, vanilla and fruit. Slight phenols and hop bitterness. Alcohol is not as well hidden as it could and should be. High carbonation reduces drinkiability as it increases bloating. Not a bad Belgian, but there are far better ones out there."
"Overall - An excellent beer.... Recommended...."
"...However, the flavor profile of this beer, along with its fast dissipation on the palate, bring to mind, to me, a session beer rather than a Belgian ale. This beer would be highly drinkable in a low-alcohol version that could be consumed in many pints over the course of an evening. As a high-alcohol beer, it has to lose some points in my mind... there's no reason to choose McChouffe over some other sumptuous Belgian beers."
"Drinkability: Even at 8%, this is very drinkable. The spices are somewhat muted, so if you are looking for a stronger spiced beer, pick N'Ice Chouffe."
"Drinkability is a little less then the norm for a Belgian Dark ale. Quite plain, but seems like the effort is there and comes across well made, just not much going on with this one."
"I'm a huge fan of the La Chouffe, but I'm not entirely crazy about this one. It's good enough, but it doesn't really dazzle me. Pours an excellent looking brownish amber color with a decent head though, and smells great. Nice and musty and spicy, with a bit of herbal grassy hops and some sweetness. However the taste is a little less expressive. It's nice to see some subtelty now and then in beer, but I found this beer to be a little uninteresting. Yeah, it had some nice candy sugar qualities and some nice grassy hop tastes, and even some spices, but it didn't all come together as well as it could have. A tad light and thin in the mouthfeel. Not a bad beer, but not a great one."
"Notes: Very odd that the taste just disappears. I don't think I'll go for this one again."
"11.2 oz bottle: This one opened with little evidence of carbonation, but poured with a fairly large head anyway. It died off rather quickly, however. It is a fairly opaqur brown color. The nose was nice, with notes of caramel, yestiness and fruits, although there was a slight hint of a peatiness. The taste has a bit of a roasty taste and dryness that wansÂ’t expected. A bit of the peatiness in the taste also, as well a a bit of caramel and smokiness. Interesting..."
"Notes: Although this strong dark doesn't fit the mold it is a nice offering worthy of a try."
"The taste is rich with a fruity sweetness that is a mix of raisins, figs and a hint of toffee. The finish has a light, though sharp bitterness and a certain astringency or spiciness that is fermentation driven. Either way these notes in the finish provide a great balance to the sweet, fruity caracter found up front. This beer has a really nice balance to it that makes it quite enjoyable. It is rich and satisfying with out being cloying, or even without destroying the smooth drinkability of this beer."
"I highly recommend this one."
"Drinkability- A great smelling beer and a better than average tasting beer. Probably will try one in the future. Getting one to age might be a really good idea."
"Entry is silky with a palate pleasing mouthfeel supported by perfect carbonation. Midtaste is robust with earthy malt, woody fruits, and a beautiful Belgian yeast. The finish is a long malt fade complimented by spiced apples and would compliment roasted beef."
"Ruby brown with a tan head that leaves a nice lace that sparkles in the light. Definitely pretty. Smells somewhat of bready light malt and yeast, but overwhelmingly of metal. Smells like I'm biting into a cheap restaurant fork. In the taste teh metal continues to dominate and makes this beer not terribly drinkable. I did finish my first, small glass but declined a second pour."
"Dark brown in colour with an off-white head. Lots of carbonation. Aromas of caramalized malt, yeast, and cut grass. The flavor is an odd combination of sweet malt and spritzy saison-like flavors (citrus, yeast, etc...). It tastes good, but still somewhat muddled. I couldn't detect any of the smoke flavors that you'd get from a beer influanced by the Scotch ale style."
"Mouthfeel is decent. A hint of spice in this slightly malty brew with a dry finish."
"La chouffe is one of my favorites, so I was happy to find this on sale in small bottles. They need to make more of these small bottles available (the big bottles are green and I don't trust them)."
"D: Something that should come in a six pack!!!!"
"Drinkability - Too much sweetness for my liking. I would have liked to have had this in a 12 oz instead of a big 1 pint 9.4 oz bottle. Didn't even finish it, and needless to say I probably won't pick another one of these up again."
"Creamy mouthfeel...I like it. Drinkable, but not all night."
"The mouthfeel seems to be a tiny bit weak to me, but this is obviously a forgivable trait for such a fine beer. It's a little bit creamy and grainy, but the body lacks oomph. The high alcohol content is very well hidden, however. Drinkability is good, all points considered."
"An unremarkable brown Belgian ale. Vague hints of complexity in an average and over-carbonated beer."
"Pours a light tan, two-finger head, fades slowly and leaves a good lace. Light carbonation and medium bodied. Cloudy amber color. Nose is slighty malty. Starts just on the sweet side, finishes mellow, better as it warms; label has the ABV at 8.5% but there is not a trace of alcohol. $8.90 for a 750ml bottle from Colonial Spirits Acton, MA."
"The taste is a surprise.. toasty malt (like charcoal) with an almost roasted peanut flavor. Drier and lighter bodied than the nose would lead me to believe. It's not sweet at all.. this ale would be good for when you don't want another sweet Belgian Dark Ale, it's practically savory in character. Reminds me of soybeans and other earthy flavors."
"Pours a deep dark burgandy red, which in the first pour is very clear, and has a big rocky beige head with good retention. Smell is hay, sour cherries, apples, pineapple, clove, pepper. Taste like biscuity malts upfront mixed with some sour cherries, with a spicy and flowery finish. Taste very crisp and dry and the palate is refreshed quickly after each sip. Not as complex as most of the Belgian ales I've been trying, but goes down very easily and would be great with a meal."
"McChouffe, no matter what style one chooses to call it, is a wonderful dark ale by brewers who clearly know how to brew great beer. It's a seamless melding of malt, hops and yeast that gives pleasure whether one attempts to tease out every flavor nuance or whether one wishes to simply drink and enjoy. A fine achievement."
"750 ml green silk screened crown capped bottle. Best before end 2006 on bottle. Purchased at Total Wine in Chesapeake, VA."
"Whoa, an eclectic and gratifying experience. A much more subtle dark ale, but filled with flavour and complexity. Dont expect serious, abrasive flavours, this is no rochefort 10, but it is a great belgian brown ale"
"Pours a deep brown with some reddish tint with a nice fluffy head,big fruity aromas along with some yeasty-like spiciness.I picked up some sour cherry up front along with some caramel and some spiciness coming in in pretty ubrupt finish.A real solid brew not overly spectacular but had nice strong dark ale characteristics a pleasure to drink."
"Pours a clear dark ruby red under a 1.5 finger beige head that settles ever so slowly but leaves only a few wisps of lace on the glass. Little disappointed in the visual experience. The second pour was a bit cloudier, but the head was thinner. The nose features mild apricot and malt. The mouth is very prickly and quite light when cold, but getting heavier as the beer warmed. The tastebuds first experience a mild, soft-spoken sensation that hides the alcoho9l content extremely well. A fine bready malt underlies a light fruity bouquet of plum and grape - more sweet than sour, but not very sweet, either - just present. The malt became much more obvious as the brew warmed, essentially burying the fruit by the last sip of the second pour. Hops are also present, adding a nice dryness and a hint of bitter in the finish. I could see enjoying this more than once, as the complexity and taste change so radically with temperature variations. Definitely worth more than just a dabble."
"Taste is very smooth, malt heavy with a spicy yeast presence. Flavors of plums or raisins dipped in caramel. Nice level of carbonation that makes this very drinkable at 8.5 % ABV."
"An enjoyable, straightforward beer."
"Got this as a gift. Pours dark with a somewhat frothy head that stays a bit before settling. Nice carbonation without being overbearing. Lots of caramel, raisons, earthiness. Slight hoppiness, lots of malts. Real nice. Packs a punch at over 8 percent alcohol without tasting like medicine. Lots better if allowed to warm a bit. Great Winter warmer."
"Pours deep in color with red tints. A thick head formed at first but completely dissolved. The aroma is sugar-coated grapes and slightly of hops. The taste came across as as smooth malts, with a slight hop bite to it. I am also picking up more raisin, and slightly under-ripe melon. The mouthfeel is thick on both the palate and in the stomach. I ahrdly notice any of the 8% ABV. An interesting beer, but not something I may neccesarily hunt for again."
"This was left after a tasting at my house. Best before end 07. Tihs pours a slightly ambered brown color with a billowing 4.5 finger head that falls to gererously coat the beer. The nose is malty, with some roasted and some slight sweet raisin tones along with some peppery tones. I like the flavor. There are raisin tones, but they are creamy. Slight pepperyness comes through as well. the feel is thick, with very nice creamy texture. The carb is nice and light. I enjoy this one a lot. The flavors are very mellow and meld together well. I like this beer."
"I'd had this on-tap before, and was mildly dissapointed. This bottle conditioned version was a nice surprise. Deep brown color with copper high lights, it pours from the bottle slightly hazy with a thick rich cream colored head, and leaves lodes of lace down the side of the glass as the beer settles form the pour. The nose has a nice yeasty bread character along with ribbon candy from the malt and a mild hop flower aroma. The taste has the bread character present in the aroma along with malt sweetness. The hops do not carry over like I had expected. There is more fruit in the flavor profile on the finish. The mouth feel is fuller, smoother than I caught from the draft version. ItÂ’s also less Â“boozierÂ” than I remembered the draft version to be, there for, more drinkable. This has definitely frown on me."
"This beer has a nice dark reddish amber color with a thick foamy tan head. Lots of tiny bubbles racing to the top. It has a strong Belgian aroma, very spicy and yeasty with a slight musty or earthy tone. The flavor is great, very fruity but not too sweet. The mouthfeel is a little thin for my taste in an 8% beer, but for this style it's probably about normal. Drinkability is ok, but I think I'd have a hell of a headache if I spent the night drinking these."
"Reviewed from a capped 750ml bottle on 12-28-04. Pours out a reddish brown color with a tall bubbly tan head. Decent lacing was left decorating the glass. Aroma is fruity, with notes of apples and other fruits. There was a bit of sweetness and also a good bit of spicy hops. Taste starts off a bit fruity sweet with various fruit flavors melding together. There is a decent bit of spiciness to it and some hop bitterness. Finishes on a spicy sweet note that lingers a bit. Body was about medium with a creamy smooth feel to it. Fairly easy drinking and tasty this is a solid beer. Not my favorite for the style by any means but a good beer no doubt."
"McChouffe in the hizz-owwzz!"
"A great beer. I did see La Chouffe there too."
"This brew is extremely smooth and drinkable. 'Tafelbier' on steroids, great stuff!"
"Not the craziest Belgian out there, but at the same time yummy. A classic but simple Belgian dark ale. I dig the gnome, but IÂ’ve had better dark ales."
"Tasted at cellar temperature, as close to 10 to 12 degrees as I could get it, as the bottle suggests. Popping the cap of the 750 ml bottle, I first smelt a soft vermouth/sake aroma from the bottle. Unique labelling with some sort of elf or dwarf holding a stock of grain. In the chaliced glass, this beer is extraordinary. Rich chestnut hues with dark rosewood, on the verge of ruby. The head is creamy, sometimes fizzy, tight, and went quickly to a fine layer of light brown/cream. Mix of large and fine sized bubbles in the viscous lacing. The aroma is everything a good brune Belgian should be. Dusty smoked malt, complemented with sufficient but not overpowering yeast, and musty fruits. Freshly baked bread, and extreme sweetness at first, with the head still at its fullest. Grape juice, slight salmon smells, soya sauce, and numerous other aromas make this an extremely complex-smelling beer. Some definite wood in the smell, dust, and strong malt dominance, almost like a fine scotch. Dare I say it, I sense the peatiness of some Island Scotches. There is soap, caramel, roast, vanilla, salty water, and an aroma I cannot fully describe which is new to me. Grassy, spicy hops are there in the background as well. The aroma is extremely appetising, with great complexity, but at the same time it is not off-putting in the least; it is accessible. The taste is all chewy, delicious malt on the front of the tongue. Smooth on the middle, with tart characteristics appearing; nuts, more grainy malt, and dry bread. The hops are detectable, but this is by far a malt offering, with sour lactose in the finish. Some muskiness, some treacle, and definite grist, this is a delightfully full and grainy drink. You can taste the grain as if it were fresh from the stock. Limited carbonation, making this a smooth, creamy beer. On the tongue it seems to turn to foam immediately. Belying its 8%, this beer could pass for a 5 or less. No excessively strong taste means this is an easily quaffable brew, but do not think for a moment that it lacks complexity. As long as supply lasts here, I will be buying these regularly. I imagine it would pair perfectly with a cheese-pasta dish."
"Attempted to pour some of this brune into the aforementioned glass, and was assaulted by a massive creamy off-white head. When it subsided I managed to get a bit more of the ale in. Very impressive head and head retention, plus the lacing is rather intense. The colour of the body is a cloudy deep mahogany, very inviting earthy/wood hue. Light effervescent nose, I'm picking up some sweet preserved fruit and some nuttiness, some yeasty phenols, and a light detergent character that dances in and out of the fruitiness. Only after it warms a great deal can some malt be discerned. The alcohol can be immediately tasted upon the first sip, and has a warming effect on the palate. There is also the presence of vodka preserved dried fruit, some earthy spiciness to the malt in the middle, and a light fruit finish that gets spicier on the aftertaste. There is a lighter mouthfeel than the alcohol content would bely, but it is also very smooth as well, no real bite to it, or burn. A drinkable brune, but pretty one-dimensional flavour-wise, I wish it had come in a smaller bottle to sample. It's not something I'd buy on a regular basis, but I'm sure I can put that tulip glass to some good use anyways."
"In the end, I'm pretty happy with McChouffe, and I wouldn't hesitate to have it again."
"Pours a dark brown color with a medium head that drops fast and leaves some lacing on the glass. The aroma is of caramel and spices from the yeast as well as some dark fruits. Nice. The flavor is nice and spicy with a fruity character that I really enjoy. Lots of malts and caramel. Very nice body and easy to drink. Solid."
"Bottle: Poured a brown color ale with a huge bubbly off-white head with average retention. Aroma is comprised of strong Belgian malt with a side of floral hops and a top of yeast. Taste is somewhat spicy, creamy and ends with a dry bitter aftertaste. Another quite complex beer from this fine brewery. IÂ’m not sure I really detect the scotch ale influence in this one but I enjoyed it nonetheless."
"Poured a dark amber brown with a light thin head, sweet fruity and yeasty smell. Back when he used to make wine, my dad once threw a bunch of stuff at random into the bin just for the hell of it - grapes, plums, pears, etc. It ended up being a fantastic dessert wine, but of course he could never duplicate the recipe. Mix some of that with caramel malt and caky yeast, mellow it down a few notches and you have the McChouffe. Well-balanced hoppiness makes for a nice finish, a bit of a sugary\alcohol mouthfeel but still very drinkable beer."
"Always strange to see these beers with the litle ones on it. Normaly the beers from D'Achouffe are not counting to my favorites; just to much koreander but this one is actually good. Nice appearance, fine smell from yeast, hops&malts delicate in combination. Taste is easy and accesible; bit of malts, litle sweet and nice and dry aftertaste. Good beer!"
"Prosit!"
"A dark brown ale with marvelous mahogony highlights. Has a big foamy beige head. The aroma is light with hints of malt mixed with apple.The mouthfeel starts out like a cider thin and slightly acidy on the tip of your tongue. That gives way quickly to a more beer like thickness and a little chocolate flavor. Which is followed by a hint of tabacco just before the dry clean finish. As it warms the pleasure in drinking this beer increases."
"Beer is good. Happy beering."
"The beer pours a dark amber color with a thick frothy white head that fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a nice complex malty scent that boasts of Belgian pale and crystal malts. It also has a zingy Belgian yeast fruitiness. The taste is good. It has a dry, yet malty flavor that goes down easy and finishes on the fruity side. The mouthfeel is good. It is a medium bodied beer with adequate cabonation. This is a good drinking Belgian. It has malt complexity and a wonderful yeasty aftertaste."
"The first time I tasted this beer I was stunned because it was everything I liked in a Belgian ale. Wonderful deep rosy color, noticable spicy aroma, most impressive taste and a drinkability to last a lifetime. The alcohol left we warm & mellow after a difficult week at work. To me Friday's are McChouffe days. A wonderful brew, indeed. Give this one a try if you like complex brews with multiple tastes for the palate. One of my favorites."
"Drinkability: Great dinnertime beer, very much a damn solid brew."
"Ruby red colour and different spice than the regular La Chouffe from this Brasserie. Appearance and taste of a top Belgium, from aging. Taste more from malt and carmel sweetness, corriander and pepper, but then a Good hop kick aftertaste. Acidity just demands food."
"The beer after disassociating itself from the 750ml dark green bottle sets in the glass a brilliantly clear brown color with a semi-creamy tan head piled high on the body, lace a thick and sticky sheet to obscure the glass. The aroma of yeast, hops, sweet malt, a bit of peat smokiness, all rolled up into one, crisp and fresh, the start is inconspicuous in its sweetness, the malts plentiful and the top fair to middling in its feel to the palate. The finish is unrelenting in its acidity, the hops pleasing it their spicy presence, quite dry aftertaste and a fine drinking beer."
"Nice dark cherry color with a nice head that quickly dissipates with minimal lacing. Smell is a bit brandy-like with malt elements. Taste is lighjtly sweet, with an extremely dry mouthfeel and finish. Alcohol presence is there but not slam bang. Definitely not a guzzler..the extremely dry finish is somewhat distracting. Paid $7.99,,,,probably prefer a Unibroue offering instead."
"Super smooth at first followed by semi-sweet malts with some fruit characteristics. Finish is hoppy but not bitter. An outstanding brew!"
"The aromas are spices, fruits, and even a little sweetness. The flavor is has a distinct spiciness that cuts across the pallet in crisp, slightly bitter fashion. Slight caramel hints present themselves throughout, and a peppery, alcohol feeling is left in the back of the throat. As far as mouthfeel is concerned, I couldn't be happier. Perfect carbonation and medium body that has a coating effect on the tongue that I found surprising in Belgian brewed ale. Great ale, with great drinkability and I hope to get some more ASAP...."
"This beer introduces itself with a serious peppery phenolic smell. ThereÂ’s also a heavy, sugary-malty aroma, mixed with yeast and a touch of alcohol. ItÂ’s a dark brown beer with a moderate, creamy head. ThereÂ’s a lot of fruit in the tasteÂ…ripe cherries and plums, also yeast and generous brown sugar flavors. Pleasant malt backbone. ItÂ’s sweet, with a medium body. Alcohol warming sets in after the first few sips. Finish is peppery and lingering, with a little hop bitterness. ItÂ’s a solid and drinkable beer."
"Dense frothy head, similar to frothed milk the color is of the deepest brown with some haze. Smells if phenols and earth, bubble gum and sangria soaked fruit. Wet and a little thin on the body, the inner lining of the maltiness holds a hermit like character. Peppery snap of the phenols and some hop bitterness wake the palate up. A solid caramel and wavering alcoholic character meld middle to end. Finishes spicy sweet."
"Nothing to indicate this beer is 8.5%. Should have bought two..."
"What no cork? Interesting. Anyways, this beer poured a murky brown color with a tan head that was fizzy (weird). The nose on this beer was amazing! Very vinous with spicy notes. Herbal and sweet. Fussel alcohols as well. Unfortunately the taste was not near as good. The vinous flavors are very weak. Caramel is the main flavor I get but it does not have staying power either. Also slight woodyness to it along with a bittersweet chocolate flavor. But all of those flavors are quite weak and don't mesh together. Just one at a time. Strong alcohol flavor comes in the middle and lingers until the finish and beyond. Yeast is not really noticeable (weird). The bottle says for this to be consumed before end of 2006. I'm betting that this beer could age well beyond even that, and maybe be a much better beer."
"Not a bad dubbel-style at all. More hopped than most of the ones I've had, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. This is one I'd have again."
"Deep brown body with a thick, light tan head that sticks around for hours. Perfect. The smell is sweet, with a hint of peppery spicy flavors. The taste is smooth and mellow with an almost herbal finish. Incredibly smooth. The mouthfeel is nice and warm, very inviting, coating, yet light on the palate. Very nice, extremely drinkable."
"Taste is big rich malt. Fruity yeasty flavors and smoky caramel. Luxurious caramel and molasses. Bitter as it finishes. Sticky on the tongue. Sweet malty aftertaste. Oh yeah, smooth as silk. Very drinkable for 8.5% ABV. Really, really good beer."
"All in all a good beer, but I prefer it's cousins La and N'ice."
"carmel colored mahogany with a lucsiously thick and creamy looking off white head. grainy sweetness on the nose, with hints of melon, clove, and yeast. more than ample carbonation. a little bit thin in the body. quick dose of slick carmel sweetness, cut by a peppery clove sensation and a kiss of saaz like hopiness. gets a little fuller as it warms. alcohol is cloaked well, and this beer went down with no problem. not hugely complex or overbearing, but a nice dark ale that cloaks is strength well and consistently invites another sip. enjoyable."
"750ml, aged 1 year, from a douglas scotch ale glass. Burgundy-brown beer with a big foamy and frothy off-white head that holds the glass reasonably. Flavor profile is yeasty, deeply malty, caramelic and notes of licorice and cloves(which I usually dont particularly like, but fits well here). Bitterness, Astringence. Rather complex, with everything well balanced and pleasant. A beer I love, typical belgian spiciness with a charming round body and dangerously drinkable given its ABV. Belgian take on scotch ale? Sounds about right!"
"Big Bottle of McChouffe: Layers on a nice full two finger sized head with cream caramel colored head with a tan brown ambered bodied ale leaving thick patches of lacing. Aroma: Nice mellow spiced fruit tones with mildy toasted malts that fullfill the beer loving soul. Taste: Mild chocolate fulfiling notes of fruit and mild farm house spices excellent beer. Sweet finish not overally sweet nice scotch smokiness going on in the background. Mouthfeel: Fluffy effervescent carbonation mild body great taste. Drinkability: So good it's hard to imagine a Belgian this smooth and tasty."
"VERY drinkable, to bad it is expensive."
"11.2 oz bottle served at at 55 degrees into a goblet. Pours a nice ruby mahogany with a small beige head that left considerable island lacing. Aroma was not as profound as most Belgian strong dark ales, but still interesting. Spices(cloves), dark fruits, bananas, and a hint of toffee on the nose. Mouthfeel is thick and rich, medium carbonation. Taste is the surprise here. If I was rating this one blind, I would have guessed it to be an excellent English Bitter, or ESB. Lots of walnut nuttiness, toffee, and biscuit. Approaching room temperature, a plethora of sensations delight the palate. Fruits of all kinds, spices, and even florals seem to be here. Alcohol is cleverly hidden away by all the pleasant qualities going on. Carbonation lasts all the way through, and the finish is dry, with a hint of fruity butternut. This is one of the best ales I've ever tasted, and I can't hardly wait to cellar a few of these."
"11.2 oz bottle. Poured a hazy dark copper color with a decent head that didn't stick around but did leave some lacing on the glass. Aroma is mildly caramel and malt. Taste starts slightly sweet. Thin mouthfeel and moderate carbonation. Finishes with a bitter twang, and a slight astringency. Not bad, but there just seems to be something missing."
"750ml capped bottle, cloudy hazy reddish-copper color, nice big foamy off white-tan head that leaves good lacing in the glass, yeasty, fruity and spicy aroma. Bready malty fruity flavors, full and crisp palate, yeasty banana sweet sugary finish, good stuff."
"Mmmm. I got a bunch of beers to serve at our Christmas eve dinner and this was my favorite. It smells like you might expect, nothing outstanding, but the taste is excellent. There's a slight sourness at first and then malt through the rest of the taste. A bit of the sourness comes back in the aftertaste, and I'm left wanting more. No one else was drinking it so I finished the bottle by myself. Get this if you like trying different Belgian darks or if you just want a quality beer with an interesting and substantial flavor."
"The mouthfeel was buttery smooth, and dryness developed on the tongue after swallowing. The malts last a while into into the aftertaste. Medium bodied. Drinkable and very enjoyable."
"Overall, a very tasty beer that I will be having again. Not quite world-class, though."
"This beer has very tough competition and falls a little short. Not bad beer but not up to the top shelf Belgians."
"Maybe itÂ’s just the fact that I view this beer through my rose-tinted beer goggles perhaps! Still this is an OK beer, but it falls way short of the Â“classicÂ” I thought it was from my ailing memory. Time goes by and we all move on I suppose - Damn, I must be getting old! Or this beer has been messed with, or perhaps IÂ’m drinking better beers - Or all of the above perhaps? NOT worth $8 IMVHO!!!"
"Damn nice little elf! Pours a dark murky brown/amber and has an almost Oktoberfest look. Very decent lace and a solid cap of head throughout. Aromas favor the sweet, malted/dark candy sugar side, and in the mouth more of the same. Flavors are deep and caramely, with dark candy sugar chiming in hardcore. A touch of that blue cheesy, botrytis flavor I find in the Rochefort Trappist brews? What in the hell is this flavor anyway. Some fruitiness as well here in the way of chocolate covered raisin. Somewhat winey, then turning malty on the finish to boast its beer side. This is cool stuff, and I recommend it highly!"
"Mildly hazy brownish-cherry/tawny hue, impressive colors intricacy. I was surprised at how large this head got, a good two fingers, on a soft pour, of rocky beige bubbles. The head did fade quickly to half of that size, the remainder hung around awhile, it stayed soapy throughout consumption. However, it did not lace well. The nose was intriguing, very airy with pepper underneath, which was quickly followed by Saaz hops spiciness, distant maltiness. The bouquet needed more pizzazzÂ… thankfully the palate does not! Damn that first sip was great! Much hoppier than IÂ’d ever guess, a pleasant surprise, spicy Saaz upfront, hot and tasty! In the middle a note of flowery-pepper emerges, as does a hint of clove but it gets drowned out by a dry maltiness. I canÂ’t say the finish impresses me much, forgettable actually. As it warms the sweetness increases, it is not cloying or tacky but noticeable, yeah, it is a good addition, just subtle enough. The 8.5% abv escapes detection, a marvelous accomplishment. The taste is unique enough to warrant a visit, lovely and complex. The body is medium; carbonation is firm, but not forced. Very drinkable, too bad I only had a small 11.2 ounce bottle; it cost me $4.00 in Des Monies. It is very much worthy trying, recommended."
"Good moderate mouthfeel, washes things down nicely. A very good scottish beer, went fabulously with a Belgian chocolate cake made partly out of St. Bernardus Abt 12. A great scottish ale though could be better; though it was deep and dynamic, it did not possess or culminate toward a high point that wowed me back to it. Regardless, a damn fine beer."
"Update Â– I first reviewed this in 2003 a month after joining the site so thought it would be interesting to re-review it with a 2004 vintage. It didnÂ’t hold up nearly as well after tasting over 200+ Belgian ales over the course of the last year, but it was still a good beer and a joy to consume. I dropped most of my ratings by half points but still would recommend."
"It pours a dark brown with an offwhite head. Most of the head disappears after a while but it keeps some right around the edge. It has an estery smell, very fruity and also some caramel. I can pick up on the Belgian candy sugar as well. Tastes like caramel, a little chocolate, & alcohol. It is sweet but not overly. The taste is very complex. It starts out more chocolately and becomes more fruity towards the middle and into the aftertaste. The mouthfeel is just right. Moderate carbonation, though the head on mine didn't stay to long. I might of had a soapy glass. Overall a damn fine Belgian Ale."
"F"
"Appearance: dark red/amber color, a nice full rocky, tan head--lively and effervescent. Good head retention and a resilient lace. Aroma: spicy, cloves, and alcohol. The taste is complex: creamy and somewhat sweet, but not overpowering. The taste seems to change and develop more character in the middle and toward the finish. Very drinkable beer."
"Its hazy, ruddy-brown body appears as a deep amber when held to the light; and its tall, creamy head of light-tan foam holds exceptionally well and leaves sheets of sticky lace at the outset of the glass. Delicate fruit greets you in the nose with soft prune, delicate raisin, light summer berries; and a touch of mild toffee and caramel to round it out. Some hops appear in the background but never come forward enough to be recognized. Its very fine, natural carbonation caresses the tongue with a thousand soft prickles before warming to become lightly creamy, and then simply sliding away - yet it's medium/light bodied still leaves a memory. Very nice! All of the fruit found in the nose finds its way into the flavor with the addition of a light, milk-chocolate note and some spicy hop flavor. And although it appears quite straight-forward at first, some acetaldehyde and phenolic notes awaken as it warms; the alcohol becomes more apparent, and it becomes dryer in a finish that lingers with some scortched-caramel and dark-fruit sweetness. It's very well balanced and none of it's components (fruitiness, caramel sweetness, alcohol, hop flavor) ever run out of bounds. Nicely drinkable despite it's solid 8.5% abv; and rich without becoming at all cloying - this is an impressive Belgian brew that defies categorization. Well worth trying!"
"Nonetheless, overall this is a very drinkable beer. Certainly is one I'd try again. This work work well for those winter holidays with similarly spiced food."
"This is kind of a run of the mill Scotch ale. Dark, cloudy reddish brown with a nice glow. The slightly tan head is thick after the pour but fades completely although slowly. A mild bit of peat, wood. Thin but not bad. Not rich enough or enough complex malt to be a good scotch, but it's a easy drinking scotch ale that should go well with mild beef dishes."
"When this beer was poured into my glass, it had a large tan head with fine-small sized bubbles that was fully diminishing. The body was mostly clear with lively carbonation observed. The nose was that of alcohol and some mild clove. The flavor was spicy and malty and the mouthfeel was tingly along with a burning sensation as it is swallowed."
"A nice dark honey-toned amber with a huge head and beautiful carbonation, a good looking brew. Apples is what is smelled at first, but that was quickly taken over by the malts and hints of spice. The dark amber translates into the taste, the sweet malt and then the warmth of the alcohol, finishing with a metallic like bite. Spices dance around in the mouth, perhaps cinnamon and a touch of nutmeg. The alcohol does let you know it is there in the taste. It is a smooth beer and finishing with a crisp finish."
"This dark ale poured a hazy iced-tea brown with rich, tall, tan foam that settled and did not leave much lace, if any. The smell was nice: apples, malt, biscuity aroma, citrus, and a flowery smell (perhaps the bog myrtle that is listed as an ingredient?). The taste was very good: smooth, caramel malt, apples, a bit of candy sugarl, a biscuity taste, a hint of alcohol, a slight hint of hops, and a trace of bananas. The mouthfeel was smooth and creamy, and slightly sweet but clean. This ale had aged well and was very mellow and very pleasant to drink leisurely."
"Dusky chestnut, highly carbonated, forming a huge, peaking light tan head with sea foam consistency atop small to medium-sized bubbles. Retention and lacing are excellent, but it is difficult to pour without billowing out of the glass. Gobs of head stick to the edge of the glass, and head always remains at least 1/2"" thick. Aroma is spicy and phenolic with notes of cloves, alcohol, hay, wheat malt, yeast and perhaps hints of ginger. No mustiness or sourness appreciated. Mouthfeel is bubbly, but very smooth and light in body despite it's high ABV of 8.5%. Taste begins with spicy phenols, leads into earthy amber malts with the slightest hop bitterness. A peppery wave of alcohol is noticeable but not intrusive. There is a brief slightly oxidized, rubbery note, likely due to the green bottle, but it thankfully quickly dissipates. The lightly dry, oaky finish leaves a saccharin sweetness on the back of the tongue. The alcohol is concealed for the most part...drinkability is good despite it's strength. A 750ml bottle gives me a pleasant buzz. While not imparted with Belgian FunkÂ©Â®Â™, it is a satisfying, drinkable brew."
"This beer is more brown than black, but it seems as if very few rays of light get through it. The creamy beige head that sits on top is substantial and long lasting. Aroma is sweet, fruity, musty and herbal. My first impression upon drinking is the solid earthy foundation of this brew. A leathery and musty presence. Then I am bombarded by an herbalness that is wrapped in spicy hop tones. And I discover the sweet malt that is blanketed with candy coated goodness. I love the taste of this beer. Mouthfeel has a nicely carbonated effervescence about it. Body is about medium. And the drinkability is substantial given that this brew is 8.5 a/v and I can't uncover any signs of ethanol."
"Deep dark murky brown color, small, but simmering, tan head. Aroma: mollasses, nuts, butter, cream, dates, raisins, dark rum, all the rich flavors one can imagine. Thick, full, hot mouthfeel, full body, tingly hops. Super-charged with hops, the flavor keeps on coming, simmers and stews, with a long lasting, rich, satisfying finish! Takes the cake for all brown ales everywhere, past, present, future. Round, delicious, sensuous, and utterly lip smackin'!"
"Flows burnt and murky under a fine gluey head. Trippy nose of mushrooms, bagged grass and woodpiles with some light gingerbread notes. A draught is earthy, a mouthful of tasty dead leaves, bittersweet turns hop and lingers under a muted shadow of savory spices and alcohol. All this funky flavor hitches a ride on an effervescent rocketship destined for galaxy gut. Unique and tasty, but truly odd, I'm still trying to figure out whether I like it as much as I think."

"I liked the way it poured with a dark brown apperance and a nice foamy head. The aroma was of a spicy nature with a complex smell of malts. Although the taste was of malts and spices, the carbination is what turned me off. If not for the carbination, I would have really enjoyed this beer."
"The fact that this is so young will require me to go grab a few to age.  This is a very nice one...likely great with a little time."
"This beer poured a dark amber color and formed an off white bubbly head that left some circular lace.  Some carbonation present.  An aroma of malt and caramel.  A flavor of malt and caramel.  Some dry elements in the finish.  A good beer."
"Two thumbs way up!  (in the words of the inimitable mainstream critic Roger Ebert)"
"pours with a mass of foam. strong alcohol in the smell. it goes down smooth, but there is a very noticeable taste of alcohol. you just know it is gonna kick you in the pants. it is definitely one to go with if strong ales are your style"
"The fluffy, mountainous, thick light tan head sits atop a hazy deep garnet hued brew.  The aroma is dominated by an assertively spicy Saaz hop nose accompanied by an overshadowed floral Goldings note.  Unripe plum - like, tart fruity esters are secondary and quite refined.  Mellow roasted barley, caramel malt and trace diacetyl become perceptible as the brew warms and the hop oils dissipate.  The flavor profile is not unlike the aroma-- An initial snap of hop bitterness quickly yields to spicy hop flavor that's almost sharp.  Light chocolate flavors then emerge only to be offset by a combination of green apple acetaldehyde and light clove phenols.  A light and pleasant molasses sweetness persists as a constant undertone.  Residual sweetness is well controlled in this brew and never becomes cloying.  Moderate in body, with an agreeable, but somewhat drying mouthfeel.  Flavors of grain reemerge in the dry finish, which is comprised of notes of biscuit malt and a touch of roasted barley sharpness.  Satisfying alcohol warmth stately creeps in after a significant deliberation.  Mc Chouffe is absolutely a unique and delicious brew, being reminescent of a Wee Heavy and Dubbel hybrid.   The drinkability is superb and belies the relatively high strength. . Further cellaring may tame the esters, but it's delicious in its current state.  ""Best before end 2005"""
"Good beer, malty, spicy, and perhaps a bit sugary (which i didn't particularly like), chocolate and candy sugar flavour, i liked it, but it could have been better, apparently its better when you put it in the cellar for a couple of years, maybe i'll give that a go."
"This is a great Belgian interpetation of the style. Beautiful reddish brown. Woody hop charater with rasinious/dried fruit flavor. Malty sweet having a great character that will improve with age."
