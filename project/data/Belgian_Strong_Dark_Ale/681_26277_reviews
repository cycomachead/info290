"Overall a very good complex belgian dark ale. The dark fruits are delicious and the 9% abv is barely detectable."
"The taste is very good with nice complexity from the yeast adding some dark cherry and slight spice flavors iwth gentle malt sweetness with a mostly dry tangy yeast flavor in the finish. Overall I was glad I got to try this - a very tasty strong belgian ale."

"A Belgian brown that tastes like a really good hefeweizen."
""
"Overall: I can't put my finger on why this beer is so weird to me.  I like it a good deal, but I wouldn't say I love it.  It's still a beer absolutely worth trying, however, perhaps especially for its weirdness."
""
""
"First impression: Medium body. Tastes grassy/earthy, woody?, sweet. Dark fruit like figs or prunes. Has a well-worn flavor - earthy/leathery. Reminds me a bit of Westvleteren. Medium acidity leaves a thinner lingering high-note finish."
"Feel: medium-full body with light carbonation."
"Overall, this is a great choice for the style, and if I can find them pre-aged like this I will buy more."

"Follow up beer: had the same ugly presentation:, and the nose was about the same.  The feel definitely improved as this bottle had some decent carbonation.  Upped review from 3.3 to 3.4, still think I got a less-than ideal 4-pack, though."

"A clean drinking brew that does not tastes of its ABV. This is an interesting Belgian brew that tastes towards a sweet English barleywine."
"Appearance 3, Aroma 4.25, Flavor 4.5, Palate 4, Overall 3.9375"

""
""
"Overall: This is recommended. The aroma to me is the showcase of the brew. The flavor is well balanced but not as interesting as the aroma. Will have this again further down the road."

"It pours into a nice head. It comes with chunks of something other than yeast. Smells like raisins. Guess what, it has raisins. That tiny spec floating on top of the head is fermented raisin. Very nice smell. Medium carbonation with a heavy body. Very very rich. Too rich and too sweet. This could be a meal. I prefer the regular non grand cru."
""
"O: a very nice, big Belgian brown ale... I'd recommend it to malt lovers - just be careful pouring it"
"WILL have again; worth seeking out."
""
""
"O: Bought this in Canada a year ago, been cellaring in China. Heard it was sweet, so wanted to let it mature a little."
"When opening, this beer gushed out a bit. My hand was very sticky. Also, this beer had some sediment that looked like cinnamon or nutmeg."

"O: Very interesting and unique BSDA. I honestly can't decide if it's good or bad. Lots of fruit and poundcake. Kinda odd flavors overall but at the same time I can't call it truly bad. Not sure if it's just old or if it just doesn't suit me. I gave it sorta middling scores, I didn't particularly enjoy it though I liked most aspects of it (none of that probably makes any sense). I tried to be nice due to the age (past the ""best by""), this one clearly does not age well as I'm reading past aged reviews."

"Final Grade: 4.34, an outstanding A grade. Abbaye des Rocs' Grand Cru Belgian Special Brown Ale is an excellent strong dark ale, and in my opinion it's a total steal at its LCBO price point ($3.00/bottle). I don't profess to be an expert as far as BJCP style guidelines go, but from a personal subjective standpoint, I am looking for four things from these types of beers - bold, complex malty flavours; lots of fruity, Belgian yeast esters/spice character; a full body; and well-integrated alcohol. This isn't the most complex Belgian ale I've ever had, but it still tastes great and is balanced beautifully. Highly recommended to any fan of Belgian sippers."

"O/D - A nice BSDA. Typical flavours, no alcohol, and great drinkability. Solid."
""
""
""
"Nice aroma and coloring. Banana notes and estery aromas and flavors typical of the Belgian Dark style. To much alcohol on the middle and end and the flavors in-between are lost to the strong alcohol. Somewhat of an astringent bitterness also that, while not overpowering, is noted in the middle taste. Likely a better winter beer than summer. Might be slightly better oaked or fresh from the tap."
"Simply pleasant to drink. Well done."
"Well worth seeking out."
"This is a fantastic Belgian Dark Ale. Huge malt flavors with incredible complexity combined with the high ABV make this one to savour and contemplate. A must try for any beer nerd and RUN don't walk if you're a malthead."
""
""
"O: A tasty beer! It has pronounced nose and tastes of plums and raisins at the start balanced out by a sweet biscuit, bready malt profile which finishes dry and clean. This is a very smooth and drinkable beer."
""
"M - Medium body; creamy. Moderate carbonation."
""
""
""
"Deep brown colour, cap of eggshell white head with a bit of lace. Smell is of overripe dark fruits backed with spices and dark breads, rich malt bill and a bit of cocoa, lots of plum and raisin, mildly yeasty. Taste is initially rich and malty followed by dark fruits, pretty big spice profile as well, coriander and a bit on anise, some yeast, cocoa powder, plum and raisin bread aftertaste. Medium but soft feeling carbonation, chewy medium body. Quite a nice dark belgian beer, ABV goes largely unnoticed, would certainly entertain this again."
"(4.0) D: This is kind of like a lighter bodied dubbel with a touch of sour, and I find it tasty and dangerously easy to drink."
""
"Cheers!"
"'Grand Cru' is a wine term borrowed in the beer community to refer generally to an offering the brewery feels is particularly great or special. Despite this offering sporting that moniker, I personally think the Brune, Triple Impériale, and La Montagnarde are all more deserving of special denotation than this. They're also, in my opinion, more deserving of my next ADR purchase."
""

"Cola brown colour. Poorly-retained fizzy beige head leaves no lace. Aroma is malty and estery with toasted nut, brown sugar, caramel, dried fruit, and banana notes. Light alcohol nose. Malt-foward and fairly sweet with a bready and nutty character, also caramel, then raisin and gentle black pepper mid-palate. Fruit continuing into the finish alongside a very subtle bitter note. Banana burps. Medium-bodied with light, soft carbonation. Feels smooth and deceptively light for its weight, if that makes sense. Alcohol is well-hidden, with only the slightest hint of warmth. Straightforward but big and boldly flavoured. Very good beer."

"Overall – Another winner from this brewer. A little bit more bitterness than I was expecting, but still a complex and interesting flavour. I picked up a dozen bottles to see is they change with some age. Worth picking up."

"750 ml bottle into chalice, best before 4/5/2013. Pours very cloudy deep ruby red color with a 1-2 finger foamy cream colored head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with plenty of carbonation streaming up retaining the head. Aromas of big raisin, fig, apple, pear, prune, fig, caramel, molasses, toast, toffee, dark bread, light chocolate, clove, pepper, and earthy yeast esters Fantastic aromas with great balance and complexity of fruity/spicy esters and malty notes. Taste of raisin, apple, pear, prune, fig, caramel, toast, molasses, toffee, pepper, dark bread, light chocolate, clove, and earthy yeast esters. Lingering notes of light and dark fruits, caramel, pepper, molasses, toast, toffee, dark bread, floral, light chocolate, clove, and earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Fantastic balance and complexity of fruity, peppery, and dark malt flavors; with zero cloying sweetness present on the finish. Medium-high carbonation and fairly full bodied; with a creamy, fairly slick, and lightly prickly mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Very smooth to sip on for 9.5%. Overall this is an absolutely incredible Belgian strong dark ale! Big complexity and balance and fruity, malty, and spicy flavors; and extremely smooth to sip on the for the strength. An extremely delicious offering."

"O: Excellent drinkability. Excellent beer. An authentic Belgian Ale. Masterpiece. Did I forget something? :)"
"This beer is full bodied, silky and creamy smooth, medium carbonation, velvet texture, warm boozy alcohol and great to drink. I enjoyed this beer a lot. I pretty solid BSDA and happy to be enjoying this during hurricane Sandy."

"330ml bottle. Orval Chalice glass. Revisited on jul´12. Brownish color, reddish to the light. Light brown head & thick lasting crown. Belgian yeast, lots of sweet & fruity –caramel, brown sugar, figs & prunes- aromas to the nose. Flavors as expected: sweet & spiced, toasted malts. Chewing yeast sediments. Full body. Moderate carbonation. ABV well masked by dark ripe fruits in the middle. Kind of sweet flavor & gentle warming sensation in the finish. Delightful."
""
""
"Medium to full bodied with low carbonation. Has a bit of a sweet aftertaste, and has a sticky feeling to it. Overall a pretty good beer, but not the best BSDA I have had."

"In all a good strong ale, very good with ripe hard cheese."

"Overall a very nice beer from this brewery. Well balanced and very drinkable.  good to comme back to belgian style beer after a few years of ruining my tastes buds with american hops. Very very pleasant."

"A nice robust Belgian ale. It's at the end of it's life according to the label, but I think it'll do fine for years..."
""
"Pours out a medium mahogany color with pristine clarity aside from the huge chunks of particles floating around the bottom of the glass. The head is tan and thick and durable. There isn't too much lacing but enough to satisfy. The nose is full of dark fruits and candy sugars, with hints of spice. Figs, raisins, brown sugar, nutmeg and Belgian yeast make up and excellent and complex nose. I'm surprised alcohol doesn't come into play. It's completely hidden. There is an immediate candy sweetness in the taste, but not a cloying sweetness. Sweet figs take center stage here only this time the alcohol comes through just barely. The mouth feel is on par with the rest of the beer. It's full bodied, soft and with moderate carbonation. Some of the yeast particle can be felt on the tongue as the beer finishes from the glass. As far as Belgian Strong Dark Ales go this one is above par. The taste, smell, feel and appearance are second to none. Highly recommended to any Belgian lover. It makes a great substitute for a fine port as well."

"Notes: Best before 9/1/2012, drank on 2/1/2012."

"A nice chestnut color as it pours into my goblet - much like the Abbaye Des Rocs Tripel. This beer too has a lot of sediment, chunks even. Little to no head. I'm going to be a bit more harsh this time - taking a few points off for those last two. Aroma is sweet and tart. The sour apple, pear, plum, brown sugar, chocolate malt, and fig flavors are very pleasant. Flavor - Very interesting and not quite what I expected - I am getting much more of a baker's chocolate and malt character coming forward rather than the fruity phenols that dominated the aroma. Still, the enhance the flavor and make it subtly more complex. After letting the cold temperature come down a little, I can pick up a more distinct raisin as the beer touches my palate, dark chocolate, and the pear/sour apple fruit flavors are soft and in the finish, along with a little spice. Medium bodied - not too chewy or watery - just right. There is no warning in the flavor regarding the alcohol strength. This beer is an absolute joy to imbibe. A+"
""
"O: Like I wrote above – a fun mix between a Oud Bruin and this style. Fantastic."
"Pours a murky dark brown with a 2 inch foamy dark khaki head that settles to a small cap. No lacing forms on the drink down. A ton of sediment is suspended in the beer after the pour. Smell is of toasted malt, dark fruit, toffee, spices, leather, and alcohol. Taste is of toasted malt, dried dark fruit, leather, clove, and an alcohol kick. There is also a slightly metallic flavor that comes out as the beer warms. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly thick and sticky mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer with some nice and interesting aromas and flavors."
"The draught version is similar, though with no yeast sediment."

"2010 vintage. pours a seductive amber dark maple syrup color with a hazy red glow, some yeasty floaters, and a receding off white head that falls back to a quarter inch. leaves not lacing but pancake batter like froth on the sides of my tulip glass. smells is crazy, funny fruit up front, almost like a white grape juice, mellowed out with a raisiny like sweetness, and a funky tart musk vibe from the yeast. flavor is extraordinarily complex. only noe does the brown ale part of this start to make sense, roasty sweet caramel malts dominate, with all kinds of subtle action, dried fruit again, almost winelike. huge belgian yeast profile too. mouthfeel is quite good, a little sweet, but thats just me. really a nice evolving aftertaste and good carbonation, alchohol kick as well. overall an excellent beer, ive got food pairings dancing in my brain"

"Overall - Drainpour and two dirty glasses. Great. Clearly an infected bottle and not a nice infection, either."

"Looks very strange. I have had many of these an most have floaties. Scratch that, chunks swirling in your glass. They look like the chunks that form when milk starts to curtle. I don't mind a bit. Smells fantastic, like molasses and apples. Tastes better, like sublte burnt sugar, or caramel corn (without the corn...). Scary that there is 9.5% alcohol. So subtle there isn't even a warming sensation. One of the best from our friends in Belgium! In fact, I can't think of a better strong dark!"

"Solid carbonation; just a little sticky; lingering sweet and sour aftertaste. Slight alcohol warmth in the end. Very good BSDA."
"Amber brown in color - relatively clear, with minimal head and little lacing. Strong aromas of candied fruits - some brown sugar and molasses. Flavors were terrific - sweet, a hit of raisin, very smooth and minimal alcohol notes. Medium body with a lingering sweet finish -- improving as it warms to room temperature. Outstanding!!"
"Beautiful beer. Will definitely pick this up often."

"Bottle says best by 2007 – and they weren’t kidding. Still, how something has turned this rank, I have no idea. The beer is an absolute pleasure to drainpour. It smells like an NYC alley, but worse, or like hot garbage, with a strong metallic-rust note to boot. Also like vomit. Just horrible. Also, overly foamy, like a Coke-float or something. From the appearance to everything else, nothing is even moderately acceptable about this brew."
"O: Very nice. This is an excellent Belgian strong dark ale."
"Great beer! Very complex taste and mouthfeel. Really coats the mouth with all the great flavors without being too heavy."
"jd"
"Smooth, medium-full palate. Good stuff."
"Overall a solid beer. I highly recommend it. Not too expensive either at 11 bones."
"The aroma was rich, lots of caramel and brown sugar mixed in with a fig and prune like fruit. Dark, with a touch of alcohol, though I have to admit, very well hidden indeed. The flavor was more of the same, rich and decadent with a large dose of sugar balancing it out quite well. All hotness had faded from this one now, as it was mellow and smooth as hell."
"Overall very underwhelming. Lacks complexity and is too sweet."
"I'd have to have this with a desert with some nice sharper or more acidic fruits like oranges or berries."
"I tried this beer on December 15, 2010 at ""Smokeless Joe's"" in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The beer poured a translucent reddish-brown (when held to the light) with a huge genrous foamy light brown head that lasted long after the beer did. The aroma was dark caramel malt, candy sugar, plums, and yeast. The mouthfeel was full-bodied with ample carbonation. The flavour was sweet malt, candy sugar, yeast, dark fruit...and a nice bitter finish. An excellent beer."
"Overall, this beer from Brasserie des Rocs is a vast improvement of their ""Tripel Imperiale"" that I had earlier tonight. This has more unique flavors and doesn't just rely on base sweetness. If you like brown ales then this is something you should go out and try."
"All in all, it's just alright for drinkability. The taste is respectable but it's not all that inviting from the get-go and probably not worth a revisit from me. One positive note - had no clue this was 9.5% until just now. Very little abv presence in this drink."
"This is one of the nicest Belgian Brown's I've ever had."
"Decent beer not quite my style."
"This is really a pretty good beer. While it meets what I expect from the style, and the taste is great, it lacks the complete package of what I expect from BSDAs. If you're into the style, I recommend checking it out; if you're just dabbling with Belgian beer, your money might perhaps be better spent elsewhere."
"Pours a moderate caramel-red color with loads and loads of floaties. Bit of a light tan head that goes away fairly quickly and doesn't leave behind much lacing. The nose has some dark fruits and a bit of sweet malt. Some dark sugar there and a bit of yeast. The flavor is along the same lines. It's nice and smooth, but there isn't much complexity to it, especially considering its age. Feel is medium with low carbonation. Somewhat chewy, adding a breadiness to the flavor. Pretty good, but not earth shattering."
"Pretty excellent. Get after this one for an authentic Strong Dark experience."
"A bit on the expensive side, but for a special occasion, this will be a go to beer for me to have in my cellar."
"D - It's a pretty solid Belgian brown ale. I'd have it again, but there's nothing mind-blowing or totally unique here. I also don't see how this is different from the Brune (or if it is at all)."
"Overall, a very good beer but does not really stick out as a top-notch Belgian dark ale compared to others at the top of the style."
"D a very good beer. Would have another. 4.5"
"I appreciated many aspects of this beer but the yeast chunks greatly detracted from my overall experience. Perhaps I will seek out a fresher bottle next time."
"Overall a good taste, but a great aroma."
"Opinion: Well, this is a well blended beer, especially at this point. I remember when I got this beer that it was really balanced toward the spice, and it was all so fresh and new that I knew that this beer had to cellar for a while to soften up. Well, I didn't intend on letting it sit for over 5 years, but it has definitely done this beer well. If there weren't so many floaters, this would be pushed up a lot higher for me...but I am not a big fan of chewing my beer unless it is an imperial stout, you know what I mean?"
"D: a little yeasty for my tastes; however, a pleasantly refreshing and positive Belgian Strong Dark Ale"
"Overall: I've complained about the lees enough. This is an exceptionally tasting beer. Perfect for cold nights and desserts."
"Pours reddish brown with lots of white head that sticks around forever. Sweet tart on the nose. Some citrusy smells coming through with lots of sour. bitter tart on the tongue. a lot of fruit coming through with a very dry feel. Great mouthfeel... nice carbonation. A sipper for sure. Too sweet to be drinkable"
"Notes: very complex. gotta keep swirling and smelling to get this brew to reveal all its secrets. more on the Trappist side of BSD's"
"Brasserie des Rocs Grand Cru was dark brown in color with lots of yeast floating around. It had a huge beige head with good retention and left a little lacing behind. The smell was brown sugar, dried fruit, and spices with a touch of alcohol. The taste was very good and complex with toasty malt, fruit, yeast flavors and spices, and a hint of alcohol. It had a long dry finish. It was medium-full bodied with medium carbonation. Drinkability was outstanding. This is a very good beer and worth seeking out."
"11.2oz bottle poured into my Narke tulip...Shiney medium copper, much lighter on the sides. Lots of yeast floaties throughout. A tope head rises about two fingers, then falls quickly to a half finger full cap, decent lacing...The aroma is challenging to say the least, tea, yeast, alcohol, and vomit...The taste again is lots of yeast and iced tea, just not feeling this beer at all. Pass."
"Drinkability: This is a pretty good BSDA. A bit too musty/spicy/sour, but overall its got a lot of complex, interesting flavor. Not the best of the best, not even close, but good."
"Abbaye des Rocs remains one of my favorite breweries although their dark strong ales are are somewhat alike and hardly distinguishable."
"Lots of complexity in the taste, and it isn't too sweet (like I was afraid it would be from the smell). Very enjoyable!"
"Drinkability - compared to other BSDA's I've had, this is far down the list in terms of beverage quality. I may have gotten a bottle that wasn't stored in optimal conditions, but with all the nice choices out there for BSDA's and factoring in the price (~$6 for 11.2 oz) I can't see myself re-visiting this one."
"Poured into standard cervoise, no head, runny lacing, deep clear brown in color. Aroma of amazing toasted malt, almond, and a sweetness like lactose. Taste was sweet, like milk-sweet, so lots of sugar and almond. Extremely complex. Slight sting, but sweet on the palate. I wish I had more time to write about this beer, as it was SUCH a complex Grand Cru."
"Beer is medium in body and heavily carbonated on the palate. Its bright up front with a mixture of citrus and sweetness, good malt backbone. The finish has a slight roast to it but overall its a really nice beer. Well balanced. I think the brightness of the citrus gives this one some character the others were lacking. It's a very good beer."
"A very good BSDA. If you like the style - I can't imagine not...pick it up, you will not regret it."
"750 mL green champagne bottle with an indecipherable best-by date; purchased 2-3 years ago. No adjunct sugars in this Belgian brew. Deep amber, with a fluffy tan head and turbulent carbonation that makes the chunks of floaties swirl around like crazy. Smells very rich, almost vinous, with fruity orange notes and a sugary caramel backing. Dense, malty flavor. Nutty, spicy, warming, with mild yeast, and sweet, but not cloying malts. Little, if any, discernible hops, with cherries, plums, raisins and some kind of spice (orange peel?). It is fullish, warming, with numbing carbonation and, apart from the occasional glob of yeast, feels very nice. This is a solid beer that has stood the years very well. Sweet, spicy and malty, and easy to drink despite being all-malt."
"Hazed, russet brown with a massive creamy tan head and some visable chunks of yeast circulating through the bubbles that jet off of the bottom of the glass. Dark fruit, musky hop and apple cider in the aroma. Alcohol is barely detectable. Tart and cidery with raisin and sour plum flavors and a touch of coriander and herbal hops. Medium bodied with ample carbonation. A nice example of the style."
"D: This is a good beer to sip and appreciate the complexity in the flavors."
"D: Complex and lovely in 4 of the 5 or so stages. The finish itself is immaculate, at least 2 stages to it alone, and it goes on for days. Beautiful beer. Beautiful."
"I'll be revisiting this again. I'd love to experiment with this one for sure. Great solid belgian."
"O - This beer was a nice surprise, above average in almost every aspect. If I hadn't been looking for extras I doubt I'd ever have picked this one out, but I'm very glad I did. The price is in line with quads and tripels, so I'm putting this in my rotation for when I need a sweet, yeasty fix."
"D- Great brown and easy going!"
"The mouth feel is a little carbonated but acceptable. Alcohol is warming and the taste makes this quite drinkable. Very good dark Belgian. Reminds me of a quad."
"Notes: BA lists it as a retired beer but my local store has about 10 of them with an expiration date in 2012 so maybe it is not retired?"
"I truly like this beer. Despite it being ugly as hell (seriously, I wouldn't even pretend to be friends with it), it's a enjoyable, smooth Belgian strong dark ale and one that I would gladly purchase and drink again."
"D: A very nice Belgian ale, but not the best. Easily quaffable, and overall an excellent pick. Recommended."
"An enjoyable beer."
"D: A solid Belgian Dark, this needs some aging for sure to lessen the EtOH, not too drinkable at this point, but something to retry with a couple years on it."
"The beer pours a murky brown color with a cream-colored head. When poured, huge chunks of yeast come out of the bottle. The aroma is a mix of dark fruit, alcohol and candi-sugar. The flavor is a mix of caramel, yeast, brown sugar and alcohol. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"Crisp, carbonated, fruity, funky. Over-ripe fruits on the palate. Booze isn't very noticeable until a small warmth torwards the end. Overall, very solid...but not the best out there. Very enjoyable though."
"Ok, you need to get past the floaties with this one, if you are bothered by this yeasty surprise don't even try this beer. If you can get past that singular issue it's a great beer, a really great beer."
" All in all this is a good beer that really goes down easy. I look forward to another one. I hope they are not all this full of floaters. I think it is a decent representation of the style."
"M/D - Mouthfeel is a bit rough, only because the large clumps of yeast. This is reasonably drinkable, the complex flavor makes this a sipper and not a fast drinker."
"Overall Impression: This is billed as a Belgian Special Brown Ale. It is a very interesting & complex beer to say the least. While it was tasty, perhaps I was not in the mood for the style, so it did not live up to the hype. Then again, it was ratebeer that gave it a 100 rating, so I should have known better, since that site sucks! Anyway, it is worth checking out!"
"D: Would go great with a desert or complex enough to drink on it's own."
"D: Goes down easily and every sip is enjoyable...if it wasn't strong, it would be one to enjoy several of."
"D: Extremely drinkable, wow, 9.5% never would have guessed, the alcohol is there but balanced in to the flavor profile so the drinker does not notice."
"D: Really good, sweet and savory and easy to enjoy with a high ABV."
"Drinkability - For the abv, incredibly drinkable. I'd love to have this on tap."
"A fantastic Belgian ale!"
"mine had a lot of sediment, i don't know if thats normal....?"
"This beer was awful. Based on the overall ratings on BA my guess is that it is a hit and miss of getting a stable bottle, but I am not playing Russian Roulette at $6 a pop. I will stick with Rochefort, Chimay and Westmalle among some other top Belgians. The brewery and the importer should be sending refunds out for their unstable product."
"D: For 9.5% this is an incredibly drinkable beer, the sweetness comes across heavy but is not cloying...pretty smooth and drinkable."
"D: This one was not my favorite. Not the worst thing ever, but definitely not a winner."
"D) This is my second try from seperate purchases -- both were a bit flat."
"I'll have to check this one out again on a fresher bottle, this one isn't doing it justice I'm sure."
"This struck me as essentially the same as the Brune, so I won't waste my time reproducing my review. Suffice to say that it's chock-full of bready, plummy goodness. In fact, now that I think about, they would both be great Christmas beers. Hope you like sediment, though."
"it is slightly over-carbonated and the resulting airiness makes it seem a little thin. the drinkability is pretty good, though, like most brown ales, the sweetness might get to you after a while."
"D: This one NEEDS some cellar time -- too boozy for me but I bet it grows into something impressive."
"MF/D: Very smooth and creamy, spicy/yeast finish, very nice to pair with an Asian chicken dish."
"Overall - This one just became a new favorite of mine. I'll definitely be buying this one again!"
"Well balanced complex malty version of the style. Seems like this would be even more enjoyable paired with (this may sound strange) a savory breakfast (e.g. smoked salmon hash or even just eggs and hash browns)."
"Creamy body has a soft carbonation. Fantastic stuff."
"This is a good Belgian strong ale. Something I would highly recommend."
"this is a damn good beer. dark, heavy malts, complex finish, high in abv but not even noticable. doubleish tastes pure quality. drinkability very high, mouthfeel great. this is probably the best of this particular style ive had yet."
"D - This was a very good beer, complex and filling, all the things I love about a good heavy Belgian beer, do yourself a favor and pick this one up for a try"
"D: An ok mouthfeel and taste combination. As I noted earlier, the alcohol makes itself evident as the beer warms up, adding a slight tartness and biting warmth to contend with the sweet toffee taste. Overall, a nice tasting beer."
"D- hard to finish. beer should not be chunky. strong candidate for my first drain pour. never again for this one."
"Mouthfeel was almost velvety and went down amazingly smooth. For the amount of alcohol it was not at all harsh. Alcohol does creep but it is a very good beer."
"This beer was quite the gusher. The color is an amber-brown, nearly mahogany with an exuberant, if briefly lived, head. The nose smells strongly of caramel malt, brown sugar and sweet stone fruits. The flavor is sweet without being too boozy. It's an earthy flavor, a nice and complex Belgian yeast flavor. There's a fair bit of spice and sweet molasses/brown sugar. It's a very good BSDA. The mouthfeel is smooth. It's definitely a strong beer but not hard palate. The alcohol is well-hidden behind some strong and well-crafted sweetness."
"Came out of the bottle gushing and a large tan head in my snifter, which was well-needed as brown yeast floaters were in the head - some quick swishing mixed them in and released a great smell that was balanced between sweet caramel malt along with some fruit notes like orange, some yeast and a hint of spices. Mouthfeel is more of the same and covers all the bases. Sticky, sweet, smooth, creamy, has a bit of dry backbite thanks to some hop bitterness and spice. The taste is comprised of sweet malts like caramel and cocoa, maybe some roasted, and also has some heavy fruits like orange in there along with some yeast, figs and a hint of spice like clove. A great example of how the Belgians can make a complex beer and I really enjoyed this brew."
"Notes: Well, this would be great beer...if it weren't for all of the coagulated protein! Damn it! They hurt the appearance score, the mouthfeel score, and drinkability score due to the blubbery consistency that really kills what would have, and could have, been a really great brew. But, if you want to be considered amongst the best brews in the world, you can't have such glaring Quality Control issues. Take the chunks out and you could have one of the best BSDA's out there. I will try to get a chunk-free bottle and re-review this in the future."
"When poured in a pint tulip glass, the color was a medium bark amber reddish brown. Abbaye des Rocs Grand Cru has rich flavors reminiscent of cherries dipped in caramel, finishing with notes of dried chocolate, roasted almonds, and a hint of molasses."
"NOTES: I like it, a little to sweet though."
"A truly exceptional beer, world class in every sense. Will buy again."
"33cL bottle with BBD of 2011. Pours a hazy red-brown with a creamy beige head and a good deal of sediment. Smells very fruity with a bit of caramel. Plenty of orange makes it reminiscent of Cointreau. Sweet malt and dough taste. Lots of dark fruit character and a bit boozy with an almost cloyingly sweet, warming finish. Moderately thick body with a lot of carbonation."
"D: This is infinitely sippable. Love it."
"Damn smooth. Tasty too, with apple, sweet raisin and thick malt, bit of sharpness, and some serious but refined heat on the backend."
"D - I'll stick to Rochefort, St. Bernardus, and Chimay. This one just doesn't cut it."
"Drinkability- Extraordinary tasty beer that is one I definitely will be having again every so often when mood for good Belgian style beer, this is a strong beer that will knock you on ur butt before you even know it with its great flavor giving you know idea of how hard its hitting you, if you can get it near you definitely give it a try you wont be disappointed"
"D- This one is pretty damn drinkable for a beer pushing 10%. Overall, another solid beer from this wonderful brewery that is highly recommended."
"Re-review December 2010: Yup, the beer is yeasty all right. The beer has a very sweet brown sugar maltiness, with plenty of booze soaked florals. There are definite dark roasted malts, with candied sugars, caramels, raisin type fruits. This is a very good beer well worth seeking out. The nose has an oaky aroma too. It is a sipper however. L'Chaim."
"Picked up a bottle at Abe's Cold Beer for $8.50. Like every Des Rocs beer I've had, no pour is complete without floaties. Otherwise, the appearance is a hazy ruby-brown with a short tan head. The aroma and flavor are heavy with sweet grape, maple syrup, and dates with mild dark chocolate in the background. The body is a touch thick, normal for the ABV, and dries out toward the finish, making it deliciously drinkable. Still, because of the sweet lean of this beer, I'd save it for an after-dinner beer. Definitely worth a try, especially if you like the dark Unibroues."
"Poured from a bottle purchased at Whole Foods Market in Los Angeles, CA. Great pour, lovely brownish head that stuck around for a good while. Some major floaters in this one. Pretty dreamy on the palate, with major yeast, chocolate, and malt. Grapes, also. Incredible flavor. This beer is relatively heavily carbonated, with a great mouthfeel after the beer's left my mouth. A really, really strong Belgian Strong Dark Ale. Got much more interesting the more it warmed."
"Solid, delicious, complex, comforting, artistic--wonderful stuff."
"this beer pours a reddish brown with an awful lot of floaties and a decent amount of off white head that fades slowly to a ring of lace. the aroma gives a lot of fruity esters with a distinct tart backing. the taste delivers a lot of earthy fruity roasted goodness. the dry finish and the low carbonation make this treat almost dessert like. it's pretty drinkable for a belgian, but not something I'd drink every day..."
"The taste is surprisingly dry and slightly acidic, as you are fooled by the sweet nose of this brew. Very well balanced having a rather light to somewhat moderate mouthfeel; again this is somewhat shocking as the nose would suggest a much more opulent and full bodied brew. This is not a criticism at all. The balance of flavors and the manageable mouthfeel make for a brown ale that has superb drinkability and is certainly not tiring should you decide to go the distance with this brew."
"This rating speaks more of that actual experience drinking the beer rather than the actual beer itself, if that makes any sense. This is one of the hardest reviews I've ever complied and is a beer I don't think I will soon forget. It is mind bendingly complex, almost teasing you with hints of something here and then hints of something there, almost daring you to try and come up with an idea of what it is you are tasting. But this has the adverse effect of having everything sort of blend together if you let it happen, and if you do this beer becomes rather bland, muddled and listless, where you almost forget what you are drinking. But if you give it a chance, this beer has a lot to offer."
"The beer pours a translucent brown color with a thick frothy tan head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is great! It has a fantastic balance of roasted and crystal malts along with a wonderful fruity yeast aroma. The taste is good as well. It has a smooth, malty flavor that is sweet and fruity with esters in the finish. There is a subtle roasted character that balances out the sweet caramel malts. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is an excellent beer. It's quite flavorful and a fine slow drinker that would compliment a good dinnner."
"7/4/6/4/13 (3.4/5)"
"Pours a very dark red, almost brown color with slightly carbonated head that fades rather quickly. Nice fruity aroma that was't too sweet balancing out the roasted maltiness. Very smooth enjoyable beer that balances out the sweet fruit flavor with a spicy malt character."
"25.4 bottle. Served at the correct temperature, but unfortunately, exploded out of the bottle, and some of the precious liquids were lost. Thin creamy light head, with minimal duration, no lacing, over a cloudy, yeast chunked body (it reminded me of some of the stages one sees in waste water treatment plants- when floculation occurs)....nose is very complex, malty, yeasty, phenolic, licorice, cherry and other fruits...tastes are spicy, malty and fruit with cherry dominating the latter, a sweet malt finish. Mouthfeel quite good. This reminded me of Ommegang's ""Three Philosophers"" with added refinement."
"Good brew that met my expectations."
"The aroma is very complex. It has raisins, prunes, figs, brown sugar, bananas, spices, yeast, and biscuits. The appearance is purple brown with a medium, foamy head. The flavor is sweet with all the elements from the aroma and a lightly bitter finish. The palate is creamy. This is a nice beer with the alcohol well hidden."
"Yeasty bread and and toasted grain up front. Quickly pushed aside by sweet fruit. Kiwi, Concord grapes, and a little strawberry all mix with some caramel and spice--nutmeg I would say. More grapes in the finish, along with plenty of spicy yeasty malts and plums. Full bodied with a creamy feel. The yeast chunks are a little distracting, but this is an otherwise tasty beer."
"D- If it weren't for those damn massive yeast floaters, I would be all about this... hell I still am all about it, even if it isn't the prettiest beverage. The deliciousness of this far overrides the 10% ABV. This is going to be a fast one."
"Brownish amber color with flashes of orange, fizzy head on top. The aroma was pleasant. Dark fruit, raisin, dates....this seems to be the standard aroma of the style. In the mouth....boozy with a kick on the palate. Dark fruits, raisins, plums, and pear in the taste. So yes, the flavor is good, but it doesn't quite soak on the palate like others of the style do. That being said, I would still recommend this."
"Darkish brown body, fizzy w/sediment suspended but quickly settling. Foamy off-white head, average & somewhat lasting. Very strong dark grape/plum aroma. Some alcohol, some floral. Some bourbon-like aroma. Some of that bourbon in the taste, floral aftertaste. Some alcohol but mostly dark plummy taste. Goes good with chocolate, it mutes the flavors. Better as it warms."
"Drinkability: This is a very very good beer, hard to find these days, but worth seeking out. I had another of this brewery's beers for Thanksgiving a couple of years back, and this beer would pair perfectly with that kind of hearty meal."
"Therefore, drinkability is a one. Try one on it fits rather nicely!"
"Not too sour, and the 10% is very hidden."
"I think if I lived in Belgium, this one would be a regular for me. Highly recommended."
"just average drinkability because although this is a damn good beer, i'm sick of drinking it by the time i'm halfway through the bottle because it's like drinking stagnant slimy water. good beer though, too bad."
"Very interesting brew. Recommeded trying this beer at least once. A bit pricey. Aging is a near must with this one."
"Overall a very drinkable beer, I'll be picking another one of these up the next time I make a stop by the market."
"This beer isn't a drink, it is a meal. It should be nibbled in small, fully experienced sips on the back porch at sunset with a plate of stinky cheese and fruit. If you can be in the woods or a small village with cobble stone streets, all the better!"
"Drinks a touch slow from the complexity, but the ABV is well hidden. Not the best Belgian Dark out there, but worthy of respect & adulation"
"Appearance was a bit odd, brown and orange. Didn't matter as this is a solid brew. Somewhat sweet but not persistant as the complexity takes over. Distinct with clove, spice, brown sugar, slight malt and mixed dark fruits. Nicely balanced with some acidity and some interesting funk. I liked the finish. Was out of a 12oz or maybe 33cl bottle. Will be interesting to try later on out of 750ml I have coming. This beer could be aged for several years."
"Pours with a medium sized head for a belgian strong .. smell of grape, tar, molasses, plums... abv well hidden... nice flavours with this one, sugary plums and fruits.... good stuff but possibly falls short of the 'grand cru' title.. a very decent and enjoyable pony in this fine stable of beer horses.."
"D: Overall a soft roasted malt palate and fruitiness from the yeast makes for a standout beer by style."
"D - Hmm overall this is the hardest aspect to judge. The beer itself is sweet, tasty and has a great mouthfeel. I want to keep drinking it but I don't know if I would buy another for the single aspect that this beer has a protein coagulation problem. Overall, though a very good beer and I hope to try others from this abbey."
"Overall, a very good beer, if you don't pour it like a moron."
"D- a great siper and delicious"
"One of the most well-crafted, well-rounded Belgian Strong Ales I've ever had. Full of complex fruit and honey notes, but enough balance to not be too sweet. Heavenly."
"drinkability is good. this is a rich brew with a notable amount of sediment in the brew (which was unavoidable from the pour), but that does not take away from the flavors present. a solid belgian."
"Very well balanced, and when filtered, an exceptional beer. The floaters, on the other hands, are hard to explain. I heard a lot of people talking about the floaters, and a few people that did not see it. This is my sixth different Abbaye Des Rocs bought in the sixth different place, this one kept in the cellar for a month, served without agitation. I imagine these are not supposed to be here, but the beer is clearly prone to develop it. A significant blemish in an otherwise fantastic beer."
"Drinkability: I really felt that this beer didn't have much to offer, except for the fact that it masked its alcohol content. There wasn't much of an aroma to it and there wasn't much of a taste to it either. I know I said it before, but it's true. This beer was a let down. I won't be forking over any more money for this Belgian beer."
"Pours with an amber colour and with a nice off-white head. Aroma of floweris, green, earthy hops and caramel. Citrus and caramel flavour with lot of hops. Honey texture. Full bodied. The strong alcohol is just present. Long nice finish. Very enjoyable."
"Smell is of sweet fruits and malt. Flavor is special. Very good. Again sweet. Plums and carmel are strongest. Banana and green apple are there as well. Syrup like on the tongue with a very malty finish. Carbonation is delicate. The shear quantity of floating yeast will never fully appeal to me, and I don't remember seeing this amount in the smaller 11.2oz bottles I have tried in the past, but this is a damn fine beer. If you don't mind chewing on it a bit, you will understand the great rating too."
"Smooth on the palate, well carbonated."
"p.s. When I opened this beer, foam came rushing out and it didn't look like it was stopping anytime soon. After about a minute or so of waiting with no sign of the foam stopping, I went ahead and poured it...and the foam stopped."
"Thanks Joe, Prosit MK"
"D - A thoroughly enjoyable Belgian strong dark ale. Normally I enjoy the strong pale ales better, but I could drink this one everyday. Alcohol is not a factor for such a high ABV beer. Pick one up if you can find it."
"This is excellent beer, even with the annoyance of ""floaties."" It's fresh, flavorful and in balance. Friar Tuck provided me with plenty of good options, and thankfully I chose well. Excellent."
"Not my favorite Belgian strong, but it's pretty good. At 9.5%, i doubt I could finish this whole 750 by myself tonight."
"D: Is actually quite drinkable at 9.5% ABV, finished all I had and still wanted more. Its on the sweet side but accompanied nicely with the fruit flavors and a very light hop character."
"Yesterday, I sampled Brasserie des Rocs ""Triple Imperiale"" and absolutely hated it... rated it very poorly... this one however, is much, much better... definitely quality stuff, and the flipside from the ""Triple Imperiale""... Pours a very attractive dark brown color with a frothy and foamy head... smell is replete of brown sugars, figs, and dark malts... taste is saturated with prune and malt flavors, plums, dark fruits, esters, alcohol, and yeast... really good, warming, wholesome taste true to the Belgian style... a very satisfying and pallate-pleasing brew that is rich and thick without being too cloying or overbearing... mouthfeel was good... creamy, rich stuff with a pretty easy drinkability considering the hefty 9.5% ABV... alcohol is not as noticeable as the wonderful combination of flavors that permeate from the terrific interwoven style that tackles this beer... Certainly Recommended..."
"D: I had no problem polishing off the bottle and lusting for more. This is a rare bread of Belgium's that is complex enough to make anyone addicted to having just ""one more glass"" yet high enough ABV to pack a punch."
"A fine strong dark ale."
"Ok lets not pull any punches the floaters take away from the experience but the flavors make up for a lot. I would get it from a tap or a large bottle again anytime but the small bottles seamed a waste to not pour the last little bit (Ill admit I did strain the last bit it was that good) I liked the old grand cru better but this one is a good representation of what I expect from one"
"A great beer from a great brewer."
"Excellent beer and very drinkable. This really hit the spot."
"Drinkability: Masks its alcohol well. Drinkable, definitely."
"Pours a very murky amber with some head. Nose is extremely sweet. Cherry seems to be on the nose. Flavor is strong with caramel, but doesnt stay constant. It moves and shifts and takes you on a bit of a ride. Starts off extremely sweet and smooth and then gets calmer, though not for lack of character. Feel is nice. Smooth with a touch of bubble. For a 10% you dont really feel it...extremely drinkable."
"This is truly an exceptional beer. Tried it at a new Belgian gastro-pub in DC called ""Granville Moore's."" It was recommended by the server after we tried a few other styles and described to her what we were looking for. She gave us this and it hit the mark.. and then some! Poured an amber body, with an off-white head. Smell was of cherry, caramel, and citrus - perhaps lime? The taste was incredible. Soft and chewy, with a fruity, yet creamy, mouthfeel. So well balanced, and so satisfying. I could have had 5 more. Definitely worth a try if you can get your hands on one."
" ~ I really hope I got a bad batch/bottle because I've read great things about this brew. The other possibility is that I incorrectly poured the beer. If you read this and have some insight, please, drop me a message."
"Interesting beer...Pours rich brown into chalice glass with good thick head with great retention, very little lacing. Lots of sediment! I've never seen anything like this, I dont know if its this bottle of what but there are large chunks, the settle in the glass leaving the last drink undrinkable. Smell is of alcohol, yeast, bread, and sour tart fruit. Taste is good, they got something right here. Taste is of raisin and some alcohol, tart cherry, a bit of apple, and a warm caramel sensation as it goes down. Lower carbonation with a medium mouthfeel. This beer tasted good to me but I couldnt get over the large amount of sediment in the little 11.2 oz. bottle."
"Overall, this is an amazing beer from an amazing brewery. Every beer of theirs I've had has been very good."
"Smell is solid and appealing, with hints of fruit and a deep bread-y aroma. Taste is sublime. Mouthfeel is thick and creamy, this is lavished with apricots, apple ... citrus of too many types to name (with a lemon zest), and some sort of malty tropical backbone that's reminiscent of guavas and mangoes."
"A really good Belgian. I recommend drinking this brewerie's beers out of the larger bottles. I enjoyed the flavor much more out of the 750mls than the 33cls. I am glad that these are now available in Texas."
"A good beer!"
"Pours to a 3 finger off white head that almost completely disappears. Weak sporadic lacing. Cloudy mahogany in color with an abundance of suspended yeast clumps. I'm picking up a very fruity nose, a bit of banana and spices. No doubt the yeast strain contribute a lot of the characteristics. This is a very rich beer to the palate, similar to other Belgiums. I can taste a bit of belgium sugar candy, hints of plum and raison with a slight hop bitter finish. A bit thinner mouth feel then I would expect but not thin by any means. Its a good beer however I think the bottle was about as much as I can handle personally. A bit too rich to consume in large quantities."
"Picked up a bottle at Bauer on Newbury Street for this past Friday night. After popping the cap, I got some overflow, not quite an explosion, but enough to spill down the sides. After letting it settle down a bit, I poured myself some into a Belgian chalice. Wow, there were a lot of chunks of yeast. Too many, almost to the point of distraction. I let the glass sit for a bit, and upon first taste, I liked it. The taste was of caramel and fruit, with a smoothness that hid the alcohol level. But those chunks, they are hard to ignore. For the second glass, I poured extremely slow, and most of the yeast stayed in the bottle. This was an enjoyable beer now. But the third and final glass was 1/3 yeast chunks, so not so great. This is a great tasting beer, but I think I'd only get it on draft, and never in a bottle again."
"D - I see myself buying this again, if for no other reason than to match with some good salty bleu cheese."
"After my experience with another beer from this brewery, I opened and poured this very carefully, but I still ended up with tons of chunks of yeast in the bottle. On the one hand the beer is a beautiful color with an almost perfect head. Unfortunately the floating chunks really ruin it for me. The aroma is rich carmel corn with dark fruity esters. The flavor is more dark fruits, sweet and malty, with a delicious complexity. The low score on mouthfeel is from the chunks that really ruin it for me. They're very unpleasant and ruin an otherwise very good beer. I was hoping that the bottle of Tripel Imperial I had the other day was just a bad bottle, but with the same experience I have to assume its a brewery wide problem."
"Tastes of dark fruits, spices ( pepper comes to mind again) and some sweetness. A very drinkable beer, I would like to try a fresher sample and compare notes."
"Highly recommended. I know I've had this before, but I forgot it was that good. And, whatever you do, make sure you serve this warm enough - it truly shines at warmer temps."
"This pours a murky brown color with a moderate head. Little bits of yeast chunks swirl around a bit before settling. Highly fruity aroma, with notes of caramelized cherry, both tart and sweet, followed by a faint hoppiness. Very nice flavor. Fruitiness follows the nose, but adds a grapy tannicness and light sourness that makes it particularly delectable. A yeasty cloviness with a hint of anise rounds out the finish."
"Overall, a very nice beer which somehow hides its 10%. Very drinkable considering the ABV. Complex and unique. Highly recommend it if you can find a bottle."
"Had this on-tap at the Surly Girl Saloon in Columbus. Poured into a tulip glass, the server did a good pour on it. Super hazy light brown color that gleams reddish in the light. Perfect foamy head on the beer, right to the rim of the glass. Aromas and flavors of apples, bananas, heavy yeast (all sorts of sediment in the glass), tiny bite of alcohol, and a definite aroma of sweet white wine. Nice medium body that complemented the crisper flavors in the beer. Overall, a very enjoyable drink. Not as dark as I would have expected from a Belgian Strong Dark, but not disappointing. The alcohol is hidden well, so watch out. A fine example of the style, a pleasure to drink."
"Overall Impression: A tasty beer. Im a little disappointed that I let it go so long and let it go all lava lamp on me. I guess I was waiting on a special day. Turned out it was the first day back at work for Fall 07."
"Poured into a trappist goblet. Pours a brown color with a creamy thick off brown head that lingers. A lot of chunky sediment is floating around, moreso than I have ever seen. Smell is slightly vinegar and apple. Taste is more green apple and other dried fruits with sweet belgian candy sugars. Towared the end I was able to taste some honey and molasses. Once you get past the sediment it is a good belgian brown brew."
"D- I ended up dumping the first glass because of all the chunks an after the beer was open for a bit the carbonation settled and I was able to decant off a few glasses of almost jetsam free beer. The flavor was nice and although not really complex did have some nice depth to it."
"Its about time we broke this one out after buying it more than half a year ago. When we popped the cap off, we had a gusher. Not a big deal really, but it did disturb the yeast quite a bit giving the beer a more murky appearance than was probably intended. Pours a dark coppery brown color with a slight reddish hint. A soft, whipped foamy light tan head sticks to the surface for a while before eventually fading away. Dark, tart, fruity aroma resembles apple cider, cherries, and sweet, sticky bread. The slick, creamy mouthfeel is low on carbonation after the explosive beginning but still very nice in its full body and mild warmth. Rich, dark fruity esters start out the flavor before giving way to a delicious sweet, nutty, creamy maltiness. Yummy."
"This is high on the yummy scale and I think I might have sucked it down a little too fast."
"Another tasty treat from Des Rocs. My only complaint of their beers are the huge amount of chunky settlement. Des Rocs beers are excellent but if the sediment was taken a little better care of they would be world class."
"Wonderful beer...! Was a bit worried about the floaters at first but really didn't phase me after it was poured. Excellent beer for sure."
"Front of the mouth is loaded up with brown sugar and molasses. Towards mid palette it shifts to a spicy yeastiness and some residual sugars before taking on a burnt spice aftertaste with brown sugar kicking back in. Mouthfeel is kind of weak (probably due to the damn thing exploding). It's on the watery side, but that doesn't mean it's not enjoyable. Hard to believe this is 9.5, but the alcohol does start to show itself a bit after it warms."
"D - Too sweet for my taste, but I'm sure my wife would have liked it if it hadn't been for the detritus."
"Poured from a double magnum into a chalice glass. Deep red-brown in color with a dense tan head that just keeps giving. The smell is malt with citrus, sour cherries, and nutmeg from the yeast. My mouth is watering. The taste is very sweet at the front, almost syrupy. The finish dries it out nicely and gives it a great balance. The alcohol follows the liquid down & gives you that glow that says the beer loves you. Really. I promise. The finish is bitter after a few sips but once the alcohol kicks in you really don't mind so much. The mouthfeel has great carbonation held in check by a silkiness that's just sexy. The drinkability is good. Good enough to finish 1.5 litres of the stuff, I'd say. This one has potential. I think I need to get another bottle & age it. This one may have died too young. A moment of silence, please."
"Very drinkable, but the Triple Imperiale is still the tops."
"Thanks to jcwattsrugger for sharing!"
"Drinkability- Very nice. I would drink this again and will as it came in a 4 pack. Rich and delicious, very good for unwinding in cold weather."
"Drinkable but i'd prefer a more fig-like flavor."
"A very nice BSDA. Not quite as classic as some other breweries, but still quite delicious. Recommended."
"-Oelergud"
"Great beer."
"Granted, this beer is a bit simple and a bit more complexity would be nice, but for all that it was a very nice beer to sip on."
"From reading other reviews I see this ""chunkiness"" is rather common."
"Taste isn't as rich as the aroma. Same flavors; yeast, citrus and honey, but not as rich. This helps the drinkability, though. It's a smooth beer, touch of sourness at the right moment to wake you up."
"Flavor is not as multi-dimensional as many Belgium's I've had. I catch the sweet amber malts, the brown sugar, the caramel, and a little of the dark fruits, but somehow it doesn't hit me like others. Possibly because I just finished a Trappist Rochfort 8, but then comparison is how you can rate equitably, no?"
"The aroma and flavor are both fairly simple, belgian yeast and lightly toasted malts. Not terribly complex, but extremely balanced and tasty. The mouthfeel is smooth and creamy, and the 9.5%ABV is nowhere in evidence, making for a ridiculously drinkable beer."
"I'm sorry that I lost a little of this great-tasting beer, but my personal rating for drinkability would have been no more than 2.0 for the first bottle. This was much higher; probably higher than desired for something of this strength."
"Bottle says best before end of 2008. Served in a chalice, the beer pours a brown/ruby red color with about a half inch tan head. It smells like dark fruit, pepper, raisins and caramel. It tastes just like it smells, and it has a nice spicy, peppery finish. Mouthfeel is medium, it's smooth and a bit creamy, and it has a lot of carbonation (but not too much). Drinkability is good, but this is definitely a sipping beer. Overall, I think this is a pretty decent beer."
"Drinkability- This was my 3rd of 6 bottles purchased from this store. The reason I purchased so many without trying is because they were not marked and I got them for $1.50 a pop. Once they figured out their error, they were marked up to $14.99 for a 4pk. Anyway, each bottle I have has been infected. I'm assuming so since the huge foaming head occurs each time. The taste seems ok, but I'm not sure about the no carbonation mouthfeel. Something is fishy here. I will have to revisit this beer for sure to get an accurate reading. As is, it has good texture and pretty good flavor. I think the fresh unspolied version should be a bit better though."
"Wow, truly exceptional beer! Especially well balanced. Poured with a nice tan frothy, textured head with brown highlights; lace is the same way. Nice nose of malt, caramel, vanilla, lots of dark ripe fruit like dates, raisins, cherries, blackberries, peaches. Tastes likewise, but, more of course. Very velvety texture. Ditto drinkability. No indication of alcohol. Does seem to have needed decanting; however, I didn't eat my wheaties this morning...."
"Pours very dark brown with ruby highlights, off-white head with no lace but some staying power. Aroma hints at sweet tastes that lay ahead. Savory spice, beet sugar sweetness, and dusty yeast aromas compose the nose. On the palate, big carbonation first off, then nutty sweetness and a touch of fruity acidity. For a big, rich, beer this has a surprisingly light touch -- the yeast has left over plenty of fruity esters and, along with some bubblegum flavors and big carbonation, this makes for a light touch. On the bottom end, the palate has plenty of malty, dark candi sugar sweetness, along with some earthy, tobacco-like notes. Mouthfeel is pretty heavy, but lightened somewhat by present alcohol and big carbonation. Overall, this is a very good Belgian strong dark ale. Lots of sweet notes, good carbonation level, a bit heavy in mouthfeel, but all this is counterbalanced by light yeasty and fruity notes. Quite good."
"Very nice, deep, somewhat muddy brown in color. Huge, huge off white head on top. Very musty and earthy aroma. Wonderful flavor-has a honey like taste to it. Reminds me of a mellow tasting mead. Almost a citrus like, lemony flavor. Good belgian yeast flavor in there. The whole thing is well balanced though not overly complex. Very creamy mouthfeel. Hard to believe this puppy is 9.5%. Extremely drinkable and enjoyable."
"Bottom like, the Gran Cru is just awesome. I've been drinking some great beers lately, but this is really fantastic, right up my alley. The taste reminds me a bit of the new Pelican Grand Cru, which I was lucky enough to taste at a Barelywine and Strong Ales festival last weekend. The irony is that beer is brewed 60 miles from my house and cost twice as much at the grocery store as this Belgian OG - thats right, I grew up listening to ganster rap, bitches!"
"Drinkability: I am glad I have some more bottles of this stashed away. I could drink a couple of these with a detriment to my sobriety."
"First off, opening this resulted in a carbonation emergency with foam and beer everywhere. The color is deep dark mahogony with a ton of carbonation that leaves a giant tan foamy head,but the lacing is almost nonexistant. The smell is pungent with roasted malt,dark fruit,nuts, and alcohol. The taste is nutty, sweet with malt,and filled with alcohol. Dark fruit along with roasted malt and Belgian candy sugar makes this beer very sweet and delicious. The m/f is medium with the abundant mix of flavors matched perfectly. This is a great tasting beer that should not be missed, but I have to go and clean my rug now."
"The first drink is sweet, fruity, musty, and malty. Maybe too sweet for my mood at the time. I should have one for dessert, because it is good."
"Another outstanding beer from Abbey. Pours a creamy, craggy head, leaving lacing down the glass. The smell? Geez, you name it..oranges, plums, raisins, bit o' chocolate, all kinds of nice, light spices. Oh, and don't drink this cold, it kills the great flavors. Also, is a very dark brown color. Tough to top this belgian great."
"It's so smooth and sweet; I'll take another please."
"Thick, sweet boozy quaff, whats with the anise in here? Thick and creamy, they dumped a fruit basket in the mash. Tastes great, not a hot alcohol burst, but subtle and lovable. What a great sipping brew, along with a fire in the fireplace, golf on TV, and Amsterdam Old Age cheese to snack on. Glad I have two bottles of the brew."
"This beer poured a cloudy brown with a big head with beautiful lacing. The smell is quite malty and a bit sour. The taste is malty and spicy. The mouthfeel is full and has a nice carbonation tinge. The drinkablity of this one.wowgreat flavor, everything balanced well, without being overpowering. Delicious!"
"An aromatic beer, with both malty caramel and peppery spice competing for dominance. Flavour was extremely malty, caramel and bread, with very little hop presence except for a little bit of that 'pepperyness' coming through. Great mouthfeel, sweet aftertaste. Liked this one a lot, and was glad to be able to share it with these guys!"
"Drinkability: Not the best in the category, but certainly a quality brew that deserves a try"
"Over rated in my opinion. At least I scored another 11.2 oz bottle for homebrew"
"The body is massive, thick and chewy, with a good smooth mouthfeel and the right amount of carbonation to give this strong ale a good drinkability...the alcohol is well burried in the malty thickness. A good solid drinker that deserves a try for this style...another unique Belgian for sure."
"Nice and easy to drink."
"Taste is sweet malts, a bit of yeast, some spice, and has a little longer finish than I was expecting. There is also some faintly noticeable alcohol, but faint none the less. Mouthfeel was quite average for a Belgian Brune. Very drinkable, though, considering its style and 9,5%abv. A lovely ale."
"I'm still a bit saddened to see that the former Abbeye Des Rocs Grand Cru is no longer being made. It was a favorite. I enjoy the Special Brown but it's really not in the same league. But still, it's a fine Belgian brew."
"drinkability is great. well balanced and very enjoyable. liked this one alot."
"I like their beers and this is one that everyone should try."
"My first two bottles of Belgian Special Brown ('best by' dates of 2007) were drainpours due to an overwhelming amount of chunky, proteinaceous garbage. This bottle ('best by' date of 2008) is nothing but sweet, sweet beer. If you can find a fresh one, this is a BSDA to be reckoned with."
"Mouthfeel is smooth, creamy, sugary, fruity, and semi-dry in the finish. Carbonation is well done and gentle enough to let all the flavors and textures flow evenly."
"This ale poured a very hazy, red brown color with light tan foam that settled and clung to the glass a little bit. The smell was malty and fruity with a touch of hops. The taste was malty and fruity with a light sugar sweetness and moderate hoppiness. The mouthfeel was smooth and malty with full body and good carbonation. There was a residual sweetness and fruitiness in the finish and aftertaste. This was a very nice and enjoyable beer."
"This is a quality beer to had here. My first ale from these guys, though with my love of Belgian Beer and if this is an example of what these guys are capable of, I hope to try some others."
"D: This one opens up smelling like their Triple Imperiale, but the taste doesn't have the same complexity. I would try it again..."
"Quite drinkable for a brew of this abv. 9.5%, youve got to be kidding."
"review from notes about a month ago....red and cloudy with floaty sediment. nice white head. great fruity clove odor. oh man, oh man...mmmm....smooth with delicious cloves and red fruits (plums?). soft malt and slightly sweet. alcohol not hiding very well. a good one."
"-UF"
"M&D: absolutely great, creamy, silky smooth, and rounded on the mouthfeel, yet much lighter than its abv. tends to suggest!! It's so hard to believe this is a 10%abv. beer--it's rather like a medium-bodied malt soup with plenty of crushed fruits in it. A superb balance between yeasts, hops and malts realises in this sublime and super-approachable ale, that it's slightly too dangerously easy-drinking. Highly recommended!!!!"
"A mean-looking beer. It's a clear red/brown, but with evil little chunkies floating in it. Good lacing. The nose is sweet and syrupy, with some sweet and tangy apple and a whiff of alcohol. Taste is again sweet and syrupy (a little too syrupy) but has some good hop flavor. Mouthfeel is fine, and drinkability is not bad for the ABV."
"In one sense (the hidden alcohol) this beer is dangerously drinkable. In another sense (do I want another one?), I'd have to say that it's merely good."
"Had it again four years later and noticed the lace, a pleasant yeast treat."
"Finish is cloyingly sweet. Hmmm."
"Pours a reddish brown with big chunks circulating around, even with a gentle pour. Thin head of brown bubbles. The head is ever replenished due to the high carbonation on this one. Ginger immediately comes to mind in the aroma. Mild alcohol and a hint of spicy yeast. Taste follows suit almost to a tee. Light to medium body. I think this one is a bit past it's prime. Good, but glad it is retired..."
"D: The drinkability is determined by the temperature. Avoid is beer when cold! The abv is a little tough but not a deal breaker."
"Notes: It was above average but for me this was just good. Not such a bad thing by any stretch. Worthy of a grand cru status...ehhhh not in my opinion."
"Great beer for my 800 th review!"
"D: I could probably deal with the sediment if the taste was better, but alas. I'll finish the bottle without too much trouble, but I won't be buying this again."
"Velvety mouthfeel, pleasant for sipping, and definitely drinkable."
"I open this bottle which has been hanging around my place for a bit longer than I thought it would when I bought it a couple of months ago. A flood of foam comes out from under the bottle cap. Sucks to see it go down the drain, but most of it is still in the bottle. It pours a dark brown color with a short but thick ring of head. A lot less than I would expect after the erruption I went through. It has a nice smell. Grassy, earthy, a bit spicy. Also a bit fruity or citrusy. Just a pleasant smelling beer. Very delicious taste, it carries a lot of the earthy and citrusy flavors. Somehow it actually tastes like my favorite cologne smells and I enjoy it quite a bit. Not really as dry as I might like, but the alcohol is completely covered up until quite late after drinking when I feel some warmth crawl up my throat. It has the sort of mouthfeel of a witbier. An enjoyable beer that is worth being a beer advocate favorite."
"[Edit]: Such a shame that they retired this beer. I'm grabbing every bottle I can find."
"D: I could drink alot of this in a night, and I would be 1 buzzed happy BA then. Great beer all around and I want to try the rest from this brewery."
"Overall: Wow. This beer is great. It might be one of the best Belgians I have ever had."
"Beer is very interesting to look at, poured a reddish-brown with a nice lasting head with lots of floating yeast. Nose is a combination of dark fruits, doughy bread, and sweet wine. Taste is a combination of fermented plums, sour apple, and bread. Mouthfeel has the classic Belgian feel, very nice to swirl across the palate. Drinkability is good. The alcohol was present with the first sip but it is very well disguised afterwards."
"D: Awesome, but certainly not a serious session beer."
"Poured from the tap at Lucky Baldwin's in Pasadena. Appearance was dark brown almost black with a thick off white head. Lots of earthiness and sour yeast in the aroma. Taste does not differ except some caramel present, hops add a small amount to the finish.. Very drinkable and a nice carbonation gives it a bite."
"This is probably one of the best Belgian ales I've had. Everything about it is quality. This is a must have!"
"Overall. A very interesting beer. Quite light for a strong dark ale (in mouthfeel). But the flavors are solid. There is something about the beer i am drinking right now... I think this beer normally tastes different, but there is nothing with this beer in front of me, so i guess i'll just have to get another bottle and re-review."
"D: Great beer. Unique in the medley of peach, wood and almonds. Not sure what more I can say other than I recommend it."
"great beer."
"Note: reviewed as listed stylistically on this site, I realize that this is not A Strong Dark but is really Brown Ale, ohh my first one."
"slighty cloudy brown body with some reddish hues. Large tan head that disappeared quickly leaving medium lacing. More sediment floating around in this beer than just about any other I've tried. Nose is not what I expected and it is not nearly as strong as I expected. The yeast and roasted malts that I normally smell in Belgians is hardly noticeable in this one. The smell is mostly of fruit, but not just of the darker fruit, this has some citrus to it. Taste is very sweet and malty. The citrus in the smell is not near as evident in the taste. As it warms, spice and alcohol start to come through at the end. Mouthfeel is full and creamy. Very good beer but drinkability is hurt a little because of how sweet it is."
"Taste is sweet and spicy. Clove and ginger. Caramle. Peppery spice int he finish. Alcohol is evident throughout but not overbearing at all, just warming. Mouth is mudium bodies, kepps the sweetness from being cloying. Nice bitter finish. I don't like the chunky yeast, kind of gross to feel in the mouth. Takes from the drinkability too. I'll try again and decant more carefully. Outside of the yeast, it's money."
"Cheers!"
"Drinkability: Out of context, it's pleasant enough, but given all the hype surrounding this one, I was genuinely let down. I simply didn't find anything that made it stand out from any number of BSDAs or even a few winter warmers, for that matter. Didn't find this cru that grand."
"Taste: sweet toffee and brown sugar hit me up front, as well as cocoa and sugar cookies. The fruits filll out the middle with apples, plums, cherries and apricots. The finish is slightly nutty and yeasty, with a mild peppery spiciness, and just some hints of alcohol. The flavor is just what you would expect following the aroma, just wonderful. Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied, and so drinkable that...damnit where'd my beer go?"
"Mouth: Sweet and creamy with flavors of peaches and oranges. Also has sweet/spicy flavors of laurel and cinnamon."
"Easy to drink, but the sediment was a little much by the end."
"Drinkability: Light/medium body balances the booze and makes this an eminently drinkable beer. While I enjoyed my first two glass a little more than subsequent ones, it is nonetheless one of the most complex and yet most drinkable beers I've tried. Dangerous, but worth the risk."
"Drinkability: One of the most drinkable beers Ive ever had (top 5 of all time drinkable)."
"In the scheme of things, it's better than most beers, but it needs more kick. Hopefully one day I'll get my hands on the Grand Cru that actually gets some BA love and really learn what this brewery is capable of."
"Excellent beer and one to try, though I prefer their triple imperial, amber/montagnarde, and noel beers better."
"Good stuff but not an everyday beer. Also 11.2oz is just enough. I bought this at Beverage Warehouse in LA for about $4. I wish the small bottles were available here in OH..."
"Would like to try a newer bottle."
"Very enjoyable complex sipper. Delicious beer but not for everyday drinking."
"This was an excellent beer. I was a bit put off by the chunkiness at first, but then quickly got over it as I tasted this beer. The high ABV means drink with caution. Nice beer, especially for a treat as it is a bit on the expensive side compared to other beer."
"I would describe the taste similar to how I described the appearance (if that makes any sense). It comes off kind of like a Flemish red ale; a cloudy burgundy yeasty color. However, this beer had a nice little bite, with a pinch of something peppery (which was delightfully augmented by the carbonation) and some strong malts that were subtly blended to be incredibly smooth (adding to its drinkability). This beer makes me think of Ghent - it's in Belgium, and it has lots of French Belgium characteristics, but everyone only speaks Flemish."
"This is a very drinkable beer considering the alcohol content but is a bit too sweet for my palate to handle more than one, but very enjoyable and incredibley tastey."
"I've had this several times and my perception curiously changes each time I drink it. Color is a hearty chestnut-auburn hue with a fairly respectable head and lacing to go with it. There is a pungency to the aroma, which is rather pleasant and, like the taste, distinctly citroen-ish. Winter holiday flavors - especially spiciness - are unmistakable, and extrememly tasty. The fizz starts fine, then quickly aggregates, creating a pleasant airiness if you hold it for a while before swallowing. You are physically vetoed from drinking more than a pint or so - a regrettable fact. I get a wallbanger headache from all the de Rocs, which tempers my entry of even higher scores possibly due them. In short, a masterful brew."
"Overall: This is a dangerous beer. They just slip away so fast, but are just so enjoyable to drink. I really don't pick up on the alcohol hardly at any point. Very powerful flavor that just continues to evolve. Even now I'm finding more complexities to the flavor that I just can't describe. This is definitely not one to miss if you enjoy the style."
"750ml bottle capped green bottle with a best before end of date of 2008. Upon opening foam rolled freely out the top of the bottle. Pours a medium dark mahogony with a big head, longevity OK and just OK lace. Fair amount of sediment in the bottle, but not chunky sediment as I found in the standard brown ale. Lots of old malt smells. Dried dark fruits, brown sugar, yeasty and earthy. Big malt flavors up front again with dried dark fruits. A bit of an ""off"" flavor but I am not quite sure what it is. It's kind of an weird tartness/sourness, similar to what I had in a batch of homebrew once. Still drinkable but just an off flavor. Alcohol lingers in the finish. Overall an average brew and nothing to write home about. IMHO the standard brown ale is better."
"The flavor of this one just shines with quality and intricacy. My review cant even to begin to describe whats going on. Ive read others reviews, and I nod and smile and say, yeah, thats another way to say it. Its one of those flavors that just isnt in our language. Theres only one way to figure this one out. Try it yourself!!!"
"330 mL crowned bottle, 9.5% abv. After uncapping, a slow, steady stream of foam snaked its way out of the bottle. A murky, reddish mahogany colored beer with a thin sandy ring inhabits the oversized wine goblet into which it was poured. I tried to avoid pouring the thick protein globules I could see floating in the bottom of the bottle, but they all started glugging out the mouth of the bottle, even with a slow pour, so I just said, ""fuck it," and emptied the thing into my glass. Long story short: there's a ton of floating protein-yeast chunks in the glass. ""Good," I guess? Anyway, aromas of cherry soda and prune juice predominate; a slight yeast scent and a scant vapor of alcohol show themselves as well. Cherry-prune juice blend with caramelized sugar added as an additional sweetener! Aftertaste of Bing cherry skins. Alcohol is mildly detectable in the taste, but the flavor profile is so big that it's most noticeable as a buzzy numbness on the tongue afterwards. Near the end, a characteristically ""Belgian"" yeasted flavor comes in as well. Mouthfeel is thick: syrupy with expansive carbonation that lightens it up a bit. Still pretty full-bodied, though, and not because of any slimy floaters! Although sweet beers are usually less drinkable on my scale, this one has enough funky Belgian yeast character to keep it extremely interesting. ""Best Before End of 2008."" A couple more years in a cool, dark place would probably meld the alcohol a bit more, making this one truly sublime. World class, and then some."
"Maybe I'm picky but this doesn't have a great drinkability level. Good for the alcohol percentage though."
"My low rating of mouthfeel only applies to the presence of the yeast flakes, most certainly not the effervesence or flavors of the beer."
"Very nice Belgian ale."
"Best Before 2008. Pours a ruby tinted brown with a big, creamy, off-white head. Mostly lasting, nice lacing. The aroma is ripe, sweet apples, raisins, cookie dough, corriander and lavender. The flavor is very fruity - apples, golden raisins, peaches, with lots of caramel and toffee. Delicate spicing with a touch of oakiness. Mouthfeel is very soft, smooth and creamy. Finish is long, with a touch of bitterness."
"Drinkability: I'd like to try this again, because I have a feeling this bottle was something of an aberration in all departments. Still, it is not a bad beer, and it hides its alcohol well."
"Extremely hazy brown with a chunky off-white head. Mild stream of champagne bubbles streams to the top. Spicy aroma. White pepper, coriander, light orange. Theres also a hint of toffee, and just a touch of bread dough. Spicy flavor too. More of the white pepper, and coriander. Lighter on the citrus than the nose led me to believe. The malt lends a fig character to the beer. Slick mouth feel with just a bit of alcohol warming on the finish. Very drinkable. Good beer, not a great one. I expected a little more complexity, and a little less heat."
"Overall, an excellent Belgian ale! I was worried that this might be too old, but I thoroughly enjoyed it."
"I always have my doubts about my reaction to the best 100 beers of BA, but the flavor of this beer made things very clear. There is no doubt why this beer is one of the best beers on BA or in the world. This was a very rewarding beer."
"Had this on tap at Taco Mac. This is one of my favorite brews, but this is the first time I've been able to have it on tap. Served too cold. After I let it warm up, it was great. Could really smell the cherries and dried fruit. Nice creamy head with wonderful lacing. Seems quite different than Chimay Bleu, but outstanding in it's own way. Even though I've never rated the bottled version, I don't remember the bottled version having as strong a dried fruit aroma and taste. I'll have to break open one of the bottles that have been in the cellar for a while."
"malty, sweet and a touch alcoholic. thick and richly smooth. toffee, cherries, yeast, and a sweet alcoholic kick. sweetness and alcohol get to be a little overwhelming after a while."
"Flavor Is slightly sweet, but has a bitter finish. Bittersweet chocolate is prevalent, along with coffee, coriander, caramel, and a hoppy finish. Alcohol is warming after only a few sips. Mouthfeel is full and creamy, but does not linger on the palate for much time."
"The smell is fruity malt, with candi sugar. The taste is very nice. Sweet malt, dried plum, candi sugar, with a slight hop bitterness at the very end. This is a nice complex beer. A little alcohol warming as well. The mouthfeel is medium. I would say this is one of my favorite belgian beers. It is well balanced and has some complexity. I highly recommend this beer and will continue to seek it out."
"Poured into a Rapscallion glass, formed a 3/4"" beige head above the deeply reddish amber brew. Note that it's hard to call this brew clear, as even with a careful pour there is so much chunkage spinning around in the glass that it scares me. Effervescence allows the head to last and last, with tons of heavy sticky lacing. Aroma is a tantalizing combination of spicy yeast and malt sweetness. Taste is spicy malts, with notes of dark fruits, and slight alcohol warming on the close. Mouthfeel is nice and smooth, excepting that pinch of whatever that keeps getting caught between my cheek and gum, and drinkability is nice as well. Still, the big bottle is the way to go here."
"2002 Vintage, the bottle was covered in a heavy amount of dust, tuck away in the back at Max's and for $30 it was sold. Poured hazy brown with a slight red tinge and a small bubble white head that receeded just to hang out. Smells of old red apples ready for juicing, strong malt with a nutty quality and a charged spice with the yeast. Taste is a melding of several flavor from the nose but it brings a sweetnes that is at first strong but the dryness helps settle it out. The mouthfeel was a little too slick but overall fine. Very drinkable, but this is a rather elusive find around here."
"Bottle (courtesy of Xproudfoot) : Poured a deep brown color ale with a huge foamy off-white head with perfect retention. Aroma of dry raisins, caramel malt and a touch of spice. Taste is also dominated by raisin-like sweetness with a very distinctive yeast signature. Body is full, alcohol well hidden and carbonation is almost off-the-wall. Nice strong Belgian ale the way I like them."
"The taste is sweet. I detect what seem like cashews mixed in with the aforementioned prunes. The beginning is a little watery, but it has a creamy finish. As I said, this is a sweet beer, a little too sweet. It seems like this one is just packed with sugar, and I can feel it on my tongue and lips after each sip. Not that great, I'm sorry. Above average, but not good."
"From a 750ml bottle. This beer poured a hazy reddish brown color with a 1 inch light tan head. The beer left some nice lacing on the side of my Duvel glass. The aroma was sweet, candyish and spicy in the nose. Taste was wonderfully malty and fruity with notes of spices, honey and maple syrup. This brew was medium bodied and very easy to drink. The alcohol was just barely noticeable as the beer warmed. Another winner from Abbaye des Rocs and a bargain at 6.99 a bottle."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Good for the style; consistently slick, with just the right amount of carbonation to lift the flavors up and off the tongue... and the drying finale works nicely too. Try it with some strong cheese, I know it worked well for me."
"Strong alcohol warmth with a decent carbonic bite."
"Poured over my sink due to extreme fizziness. Pours a dark amber, opaque, can't see a damn thing through it. Off white head dissapates to about nothing quickly. Aromas are very yeasty and barnyard like, some super funk going on. Flavors are a rush of craziness. Not altogether really sweet, a little bitterness and some sourness in the finish. A little too funky for me, rather go with a Rochefort 10 (dissimiliar style?). Mouthfeel is lighter than expected, not so heavy and syrupy as other strong Belgians. This beer is basically a loaf of bread in flavor, not sure if I enjoy that (I have excellent nearby local bread I'd rather eat). Alcohol isn't too discerning, but is warming. Still not quite sure if this ""Special Brown"" is in fact the same as the original, but still a good brew IMO."
"Best before 2007. Pours a swampy brown liquid with a light brown-caramel head of two fingers. Froth crowned out the bottle when opened. Smells funky phenol, belgian candi sugar, chocolate, yeast, pepsi, and clean fresh straw. Tastes mild phenolic edge. Chocolate malty sweet with some candi sugar. Yeasty. Raisins and caramel. Mild alcohol. Overall, a nice deep and wide dark character. Md body and moderate carbonation."
"Awesome! I was really looking forward to trying this beer, and have been storing it for a few weeks. A bit of a wild mood was enough to dare me into popping it open for a glass. Definitely deserves to be rated so highly."
"It's basically all in there. If it's every been in a beer, then you'll find it in this Grand Cru (except for, perhaps chili peppers and chicken wings...don't ask). Right from the pour, a muddy bronze, rust color emits aromas that are distinctly Belgian, but with even the kitchen sink. Aromas lead right into the flavors with: bready, malt, spicy, fruity, vineous, musky, grape, figs, dates, nuts, toast, candy sugar, yeasty, astringent, sherry, citrus, alcohol, peaches, woody, pears, mangos, fruitcake....the list goes on and on. All of the flavors meld together and are well aged into a delicate, yet bold prague for the beer lover (it's all in there). The feel to the mouth is everywhere from astringent to sweet to dry to full. The finish is lightly dry, tart, and sweet. One of the more complex beers out there, but difficult to put into perspective. Could be a bit cleaner."
"Great stuff. If I ever see it again, I will have another."
"This belgian pours a cloudy brown with lots of nice yeast floating around the body. It leaves a thick frothy tan lace that sticks to the glass and looks magnificent. The aroma is fruity peach, plum, raisin, dates, figs, honey, spicey vanilla the nose is so complex. The taste is so smooth, is this really 10% abv? cause it can't be found in this brew it is very well hidden and the fruit, and the slight hops in the beer just compliment each other so well. It finishes bitter sweet syrup thick and creamy. This is one of the best crafted brews I've had in awhile, fantastic."
"Drinkability: a real slow sippin' beer. The flavors are well balanced but the alcohol levels cut into the overall drinkability here. One bottle is sufficient in a session."
"Drinkability: For 9.5% it is very drinkable, though I doubt I could have finished the whole 750 by myself. I would definetly try this again, or at least try the other Grand Cru that looks so similar..."
"Notes: 750ml bottle, with freshness date."
"Pours a nice dark brown/amber, about a finger and a half of very fluffy off-white head with significant lacing. Smell is very much of dark fruit, very sweet, and slightly alcoholey, like most belgian strong darks I've had. Taste is similar to smell, but less sweet and alcoholey. Dark fruits, spices, yeasty and somewhat malty, with a nice slight warmth obviously due to the alcohol, but not too much flavor due to it. To be honest, I wouldn't've minded a bit more of the alcohol flavor, I think it would have gone well with the present flavors, but thats just me. Smooth beer, smooth finish, delicious aftertaste, very drinkable. I could definitely drink more than one."
"This beer poured a nice head that dissapated into a small head with a lacing that's slighty sticky. The color is bright red to dark. Smells very nice, pretty sweet and it's very smooth on the palate. It also has a little nutmeg flavor in it with some slight orange undertones. It's a little smooth and slightly crisp. I feel like it could've had a better head and mouthfeel, it seems like this beer had been abused and incorrectly aged."
"An excellent beer that hides the alcohol exceedingly well and has evolving sweet flavors that entices and mystifies."
"drinkability: great, so long as you're only gonna have one 750ml of this bad boy."
"""Your going home by the back roads, right?"""
"When removing the cap, this one burst forth with explosive carbonation, making a hell of a mess. After a things calmed down and were cleaned up, the brew revealed itself as a murky, muddy, reddish-brown color with a bulbous, towering light-tan head. Brown sugar, plum, sour apples, alcohol, yeast, and spice all mingle in the aroma. Its a funky, spicy, musty, earthy, resoundingly intense aromaintriguing to say the least. The taste is only a little sweet, with a serious meaty yeastiness. Stingingly high carbonation. For a such a high ABV, this one hides its alcohol welltheres a little in the aroma, and just a slight warming, but it doesnt overwhelm the taste. Full and complexno question about it."
"Many thanks to Brewfan for trading this to the Left Coast!"
"Upon reading more reviews I'm noticing that few others have called this hoppy - my bottle says best by 2008. Did I get a different year than what other people are reviewing? I'm aware I've presented the lowest rating so far and I'll stand by it."
"Overall and interesting brew, but not overly impressive."
"Deep ruby/brown, fairly clear from the initial pour, but with lots of tiny, suspended yeast particles. Fine, light tan head with decent lacing and good retention. Mild aroma with some bread, apple, and chocolate. Malty, but subdued. Moderate malt character with chocolate and orange, and slight raisin. There's a nice breadiness and apple flavour that runs throughout, and it finishes with lingering fruit and mild chocolate. Fine carbonation and a silky texture. An excellent beer, complex without being overpowering, and the alcohol is completely hidden."
"D: A little on the sweet side to drink a lot of this stuff, but still a winner. This is perhaps one of the best brown ales I've experienced... and I mean experienced, not consumed. Very good to curl up with, especially on a cold winter night and enjoy with the closest of friends!"
"Beer is good. Happy beering. 197/4.35"
"Pours a chunky ruby red/brown, medium off white head, lots of sticky lace. Smell is sweet, molasses/caramel, orange, spice, alcohol, chocolate/coffee, yeast, and cherries. Taste is molasses/brown sugar, apple/pear, cherry, yeast, chocolate, caramel and orange. Mouthfeel is smooth, medium to high bodied, medium carbonation, lives up to reputation. Thanks DrJay!"
"A brew I couldn't wait to open, and it left me somewhat disappointed. Gets better as it warms. I just don't like phenolic beers, period. Even though this is only slightly so, it steals a bit from me. Still a fine beer, but not the kind to knock me for a loop."
"I thought this beer was amazing. The high Abv is dangerously hidden in the interesting array of flavors. I would highly recommend this brew."
"Nearly perfect synergy makes it exceptionally drinkable and smooth in spite of its high alcohol content. Great beer."
"I can't wait to get to UJ's for another one of these. This is a truly awesome beer, well worth the price of admission. I hope I can get it in a 750."
"Poured gently from the bottle, it looks like a nice mixture of caramel and honey. Creamy looking head sits about an inch tall. In the nose I get a strong tart apple smell mixed with rose petals and pepper. The taste reminds me of a good English Pale Ale, but far more buttery caramel and a sweet aftertaste that I'm tempted to describe as vanilla. Very pleasing. No complaints when it comes to the mouthfeel, not too thin and certainly not too thick. I could have a couple bottles of this and not get tired of it. Too bad the ABV would decide for me!"
"Notes: Try it, regardles of the price. Definitely one of the best beers I've ever had, in all aspects."
"750 ml, best before 2007. Deep chestnut-colored liquid, with auburn highlights, supports a column-like head of dense, finely interwoven biege bubbles. Lacing is fair to middlin'. No carbonation is visible, though there are a few globs of sediment floating around. Smells fruity and alcoholic, with rum raisin and a vague spiciness that eventually comes closest to cinnamon. Nosefeel is clean, penetrating, and liqueurish. After an initial flavor of brown sugar, the taste becomes like drinking a fruitcake... dank, rum-soaked fruitcake laden with candied fruit and pecans. Apple butter rounds out the finish and burps of dried pineapple soon follow. Alcohol is very notably warm without being at all harsh in the mouthfeel, leading to a smooth, dry finish. Everything just adds up to give this beer fantastic drinkability. Very satisfying."
"So this wasn't the prettiest beer ever, but this was tasty."
"Pours a murky dark brown with big fluffy chunks of yeast suspended beneath a creamy cloud of speckled khaki head. Nose is flush with spicey and yeasty notes with a cidery backbone. Taste is dominated by a bitter spiceyness over baked apple, pear, and dark fruits, caramel/toffee malts and a hint of chocolate. Champagne mouthfeel, crisp with a dry finish. Alcohol is present but fairly well-hidden for 10%, nevertheless, I felt it a few minutes after the final sip. A pretty tasty BSDA, though I think I'd prefer a Trois Pistoles any day."
"from the bottle. poured brown with lots of bubbles and with a big and I mean big fluffy light tan head. aroma lots of fruits going on here, cherries, peaches, and a trail mixture of dried fruits, malt. flavor, malts all those fruits, honey . caramel, chocolate covered cherries and brown sugar as it warmed. like this one nice and smooth very drinkable"
"Overall: Wow, this one is killer. One of the better Belgian ales I've tried, and that I got it for seven bucks a bottle makes me even more excited. You could pay a lot more for a brew, but I'm not sure you could find one that tastes much better."
"Alcohol for the most part is hidden well, starts out not noticable but as it warms in the glass it starts to peek out and burn the throat a little."
"Pours a nice, clear amber with some ruby hues and a huge, frothy tan head that retains very well. Aroma is intriguing with notes of candied sugar, dark fruits (plum, fig, grape, blackberry), funky barnyard yeast, cocoa, toffee, and some toasted bread as well as alcohol. The flavor begins with some big fruit notes (blackberry, plum, fig, grape) followed by a candied sugar sweetness, horseblanket/hay funkiness, some floral and mineraly hop bitterness and some alcohol notes in the finish. Very complex and intriguing, but the funky horseblanket flavor is slightly overwhelming in my opinion. The mouthfeel is full and rich like a quad and the drinkability is ok. A nice, complex belgian that hides it's strength well."
"Quite a tasty experience!"
"This is a Belgian Brown but that choice is not listed in styles."
"This is one of the better dark Belgians I have had. I really like the unique carmelly taste and smell. I would definitely recommend this one."
"T - I blew through an entire chalice of this beer in just 5 minutes while condicting this tasting... drinkable? You do the math."
"330 cl bottle. Pours out a dark, brownish red color with a dense head. There are a lot of small chunks suspended in the beer. The aroma is rich and malty with toffee and tropical fruit. Big malt flavor with lots of toffee at first. Becomes fruity in the middle, especially plums. The finish is nice and spicy, like a winter warmer. Alcohol is noticable, but doesn't get in the way of the flavor at all. The mouthfeel is incredible. This beer coats the mouth, and the flavor lingers. Much more drinkable than any beer should be at 9.5% abv. This is an amazing beer."
"Brown leahter head--tinged with some purple--with a slow developing head that stuck around for a bit. Very rich and deep. Nose is like plunging my head into a candy bowl filled with Deccos. Oh, so sweet smell. Flavor is complex at first, but breaks down very simply. Heavy malt flavor with lots of prunes and sugars. Some cherries and molasses too. Flavor does not cling to my taste buds either but allowed me to enjoy my meal in and of itself as I ate. Mouthfeel was quite medium body, but spread the palate out and was surprisingly a good complement with my barbeque. The alcohol is greaty hidden behind the beer and I hardly notice it until after I feel the effects. Very difficult to separate from my hand as I picked up my ribs."
"This is the good stuff. Wonderful color and head retention. The beer is highly aromatic, and the flavors are deep, rich, round, and robust with complex fruits and malty sweetness all sharing the same bottle. This is an extremely substantial and satisfying beer. A classic for sure. I'm coming back for more!!!"
"You won't find a much more complex brew..seek it out and try it..there will be no regrets...unless, of course, you only buy one bottle."
"Rich malts and sugars, Belgian yeast character, all very subdued. Ruby/garnet with a lasting dirty white head. Nice clarity. Very soft flavor. It will kick you in the ass if you are not carefull. Lots of bubbles as it folls over the tongue. I enjoy this a lot."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a more mellow carbonation. Fills the mouth nicely and goes down easily. This is a treat to drink and another testament to the amazing brewers at Abbaye des Rocs. I'm having no problem indulging and hope to have the chance to visit the brewery in Belgium one of these days. A truly great brew that lives up to its name."
"750 ml bottle pours a cloudy bright reddish-brown with a lot of floating yeast particles that has a nice creamy light brown head that lasts and leaves sticky sheets of lacing in my glass. Spicy ginger and chocolate aromas, ginger, nutmeg, pear, caramel, chocolate and plum flavors. Full bodied with a perfect soft and creamy mouthfeel, lasting spicy finish."
"A rather pleasing shoe brown in hue, with a thick, developing and lasting white bubble bath head, chunks of sugary patches that last as well. Where to begin with the aroma  an onslaught and mixture of fresh bubble gum, nuts, caramel, mango, pineapple, cinnamon and malts are all noted, and the aromas develop even further as the beer matures. Large malt based undertones, combined with port like tastings, peppers and slick Belgium spices. Brown sugar, raisins and wheat bread are tasted towards the finish; its a sad finish though, one of the best; oh so tasty and enjoyable; drink ability is off the charts!"
"Delicious. A great piece of work, and a nice canidate for the table."
"Overall a great beer. ""Top Tier"" for sure"
"Best version of style I've had so far. Bold, but not overpowering. Unique flavors with great blending and no excesses. The fruit flavors temp quicker drinking, but other malts require slower sipping. Wow."
"Drinkability is fantastic on this great beer, has quickly become one of my favorites."
"Drinkability: This is a lovely creation, and the price is difficult to beat. Grows a bit heavy on the palate near the room temperature finish, but this is really created to style and very well constructed. Can't wait to try the Tripel later today. Highly recommended!"
"One of the best beers I've had and a pleasingly different experience in the bottle and on-draft. The bottles have more wine-like acidity and are dryer, more champagne-like. The draft is intensely yeasty, with superb cherry and caramel malt notes."
"A good Belgian strong dark ale that's on the malty side of things."
"Nice head and lacing on a dark brown body on this one. Long awaited, has sat in my dedicated beer fridge for 3 months. Planning a trip to Belgium in two weeks, so a true Belgian beer sounded good. Smell is basically sweet fruitiness with some strong medicinal phenols. These disappear however in the taste (which is good) which definitely exhibits a lot of the fruit in the smell. There is also a mild spiciness in the taste, and a very intriguing bubble gummy flavor, which I think is the best feature of this beer. Other than that, I don't find much to really rave about, though this is certainly a very good beer that I would drink again. All in all a bit too subdued for my tastes. Oh wait, I forgot the mouthfeel, which is excellent. Nice and thick and creamy, it really stands out as well."
"Big body on this one with a rich and chewy texture and a creamy malty mouthfeel. Lip smacking sweet without being cloying."
"This review probably sounds like I didn't enjoy the beer, but I did. Maybe it was just the mood I was in last night, but I wish I would have bought about three or four of these. I could easily drink these down fast. Quite a thirst quencher in my opinion."
"Overall a good belgian dark. Its hard to stand out with so many good examples of the style, but this one does its part and hangs in with the best of them."
"Cheers."
"Amazing shit. I could drink it all night long until the stealthy abv caught up with me."
"Translucent dark ruby with mellow golden edges, so beautiful under the light. Chucky yeasts floating around and a prodigious head that lasts for many minutes before leaving a latticework of lacing. Smell is that Belgian candi smell, but with some alcohol and a mildly bittering odor, nuts maybe or a spice. Taste is not as sweet as I expected. Mildly malty with a trace of hops, wonderful dark fruits bathed in alcohol. I love this kind of stuff. I wish 5% beers would taste like this so that I could have more on a school night. Mouthfeel is slick, medium, super long finish and that alcohol warmth. Not a great beer for a 90+ F day, but I'm in air-conditioning...I can wear shorts and a t-shirt and put my feet in a bucket of ice. This brew is worth it."
"Overall I'd say this is a good beer, but the drinkability factor, not so much. It's too heavy, and way too sweet after a while- and it's just so bumming when things don't taste the way they smell, especially when you think they smell soooo good."
"This wasn't the miracle of a beer I was hoping for but I would love to have a glass of this from time to time."
"Overall: Amazing, amazing beer. Grand Cru alright. This is probably the most crisp 10% abv beer I've ever had. Defintely a step up from the normal Abbaye which is a great brew in its own right."
"Overall: I really enjoyed this Grand Cru it's a top notch dark strong ale for sure. I look forward trying more from the brewery, the Imperial Triple is next."
"What's all the hubub? I was really pumped to try this and honestly I was a bit let down. Sure, it's a good beer, but not particularly amazing, not even within its style. Appears a ruddy light brown, bubbly with a decent head. Smell is sweet and spicy, with pepper and a whif of orange or some fruit. Taste is much the same. This is a complex beer, certainly, but something about it just doesn't get me going. It really just reminds me of a beered-up tea or something, with some nutrasweet. Really I'm being a little harsh, it's a good beer, but judging by the scores here and reading the top reviewers takes on this one I was surprised when I found it to be a pretty typical Belgian Ale."
"Label says ""Brasserie des Rocs," Belgian special brown ale, 9.5% ABV."
"Reviewed 03-23-05, but realized I reviewed the Brune instead. Thanks for the delete function."
"Drinkability: Way too amazing to drink all the time, unless you're a celebrity who has a lot of money and somehow can afford cases and cases of good beer. But if you're a celebrity I imagine you'd know nothing about beer, even if you said you did. Regardless, this is a fantastic example of the style, and I think it may be bad that I tried this Grand Cru when I have so many others sitting to try. However, the fact that I have 2 bottles left makes me a happy man. They will be a cause for celebration, and I'd suggest you try this beer immediately and also buy at least one more, just in case you think it's as good as I do."
"taste: pretty much the same as in the bottle. smoother perhaps with a denser carbonation and more life. all the characters in the aroma come out in full saccharin force, leaving no bitterness, hops, malt aftertaste or anything other than ambrosian sweetness. drinkable when you're talking 8oz sample, 750mls would be a tough feat at this point for me."
"This beer hides the 10% ABV very well. Maybe a slight too carbonated but it feels great otherwise. Very drinkable. So much so that you need to be careful with it given the 10% ABV."
"Drinkability and Overall: Thanks to GCLarkage for the fabulous brew. It's one of the better beers I've tried in a long time. So full of complexity, so balanced, yet so fun to drink. This one is a must try, and could quite possibly be one of the kings of Belgian beers."
"A glowing maple with a head that is sizzly at first with quick-rising bubbles keeping it afloat. It settles and fades a bit early, but leaves a little lace behind. The aroma is very strong. In fact, my friend walked into the room just after I popped the cork, and could smell it from five feet away. I really do not want to list all of the things I found to be in the aroma or flavor, because it would be long and do it little justice. Suffice it to say that there is a little bit of everything in this brew, and it is blended perfectly - the sweetness, the spiciness, the fruitiness, the alcohol, the body, the feel, and a very impressive drinkability for such a strong beer. Divine."
"This improved exponentially as it warmed to the recommended serving temp. It's my own fault for initially serving it 10 degrees cooler, but I guess I'll have to live and learn. It didn't affect the above review. At 52 degrees, it was wonderfully complex with wave after wave of different flavors surprising me at each sip. A first class beer and well worth the price. Like many Belgian ales, flavors become even more complex and interesting if paired with the right food."
"Give me more! Give me more! Drinkability is high only because I'm saying screw the alcohol level. Let's drink this all night until we fall asleep in our glasses..."
"Candy apples all in an easy to drink package. Its been a while since I had this beer and it is much smoother than I remembered. The aftertaste lingers pleasantly. Its good they make the 12oz since it would be too easy to drink a whole 750 ml. Got it at Plumpjack for 4 bucks."
"Pours a very pretty burgundy brown with a cream colored head and multitudes of yeast floaters. Aroma is dominated by a sugary sweetness, subtle fruity esters and alcoholic undertones. Big rich malt flavor, lightly hopped. There is a soft lingering vinous quality that I love. The alcohol is well blended, noticeable but not overwhelming. Thick and full bodied."
"ng"
"Drinkability: Very nicely put together, this beer is satisfying and complex. It's certainly one worth seeking out."
" Drinkability is good alcohol well hidden just a warming sensation is all that is felt a nice Belgian Strong Dark Ale but hard for me to see why its rated as high as it is good no doubt but not the best by anymeans."
"I have been thoroughly impressed by this beer. Words would fail to express my love of this beer, so I will simply express it in an array of symbols that may or may not mean anything:  ₫   ◦ ▬  ▒ ≡  ☼"
"25.4 ounces of green glass bottle, very fancy looking, all capped and corked. Very loud pop when the cork is pulled. Pours a dark but crystal clear and brilliant cranberry/scarlet color. Very light tan head is massive, even after a conservative pour. Smell is rich and earthy, spicy and sweet. Light alcohol in the nose. Taste is full and satisfying. Bitter and slightly musty, so much going on throughtout the beer which ends mucgh drier than it starts. Very warming on a cold February day. Excellent beer, demolishes many others in the style."
"I promised myself that I would save any 5-star ratings for only world-class characteristics, but this beer gets just about everything right. Unforgettable..."
" I like this beer but am dissappointed by the bitterness. It is too present. The Abbaye des Rocs Belgian Burgundy is much better alone and I assume with food. Whoo Hoo to the dubbel once again. The dubbel trumps the Grand Cru."
"Corked and capped 750ml bottle. Ive had this one before but lets just say my palate wasnt very acute after a full day of beer festing. Do yourself a favor, dont try to get the cork out of this one without the proper implement, its a rugged one. When poured out into my La Trappe goblet the body of this beer is ruby brown and hazy, topped with a meringue like head of off-white foam. Flecks of sediment can be seen sinking to the bottom. This is one delicious smelling beer, lot of vinous notes with hints of brandy soaked fruit. Sweet malt, toffee, and spicy, musty, delicious yeast. The flavor is candy sweet without being cloying. There is a pear-like fruitiness across the front of my palate, combined with suprising sweet coffee like notes. Then that flavor that I often Belgian Strong Darks that I refer to as dates rolled in attic dust, I love it really. The finish is musty, nutty and delicious, with a robust spicy alcohol punch. What a really great frickin beerone that I will definitely be picking up again."
"Thank you Half Time for carrying this beer. Pours a moderately clear brown with a super thick beige head. Retention and lacing are as good as it gets. Just a beautiful beer. Smells lightly orangey with a bit of ginger. Perhaps a bit of bread but not overly yeasty. Inviting. Mildly fruity in it's malt. Almost like a light bock, but different. Hints of milk chocolate pop in and out. Peppery, fuity, funky. Finishes mildly tart and a hint of yeast twang dryness. Everything about this is understated. It's sublime."
"Really stood up nicely against the lamb shanks my roomate made for dinner. And its hard to stand up to the meatiest of meats."
"Sampled at From The Vine beer tasting Jan 14th, 2005: Hazy amber with a thick and foamy beige head. Decent lacing. The aroma is sweet with malt, yeast and melon. Full-bodied, creamy and satisfying with a complex array of flavors from ginger, caramel and malt to fruit and even chocolate. I was blown away by how flavorful even a small glass of this was. The finish is sweet and lingering with roasted malt and spices (cinnamon, figs). Outstanding Belgian!"
"cloudy deep garnet with a thick head that dissipated into a spotted coating. caramel and toffee on the nose, with some floral hops. dried cherries and other dark fruit bring a tart flavor that is slightly refreshing along with the nice carbonation. noticeable bitterness with a nutty finish. ooh! i could drink it all night (weekend)"
"Pours a medium brown with a nice off-white head. Aroma isn't strong (surprisingly), slightly sweet and malty. Flavor- alcohol profile on top of a nice brown ale at first. In fact, at first, I couldn't get past the alcohol and wasn't going to like it at all. However, it's a good thing I am a patient person. Because, as sometimes happens, it gets better (ok, much better), more complex (dark bready and spices, among others) , and more balanced as it warms towards room temperature. Mouthfeel is nice and bold, but the alcohol profile still holds it back at he end (for me)."
"Large bottle, with cap and cork, no freshness dating. Pours dark garnet,brown. Poured with a gassy release, lifted a large and rocky tan head, which slowly morphed to a blotchy film. Leaves some thick, stringy lacing. Yeasty chunks abound. Nose is rum raisins, murky funk and sweat malts. multilayered, complex flavors and sensations on the tongue. Obvious and unrelenting waves of interest and intrigue. World class sipper. Dangerously drinkable. Seek out this nectar and enjoy."
"750 ml deep green bottle, capped and corked."
"Pours an amber color with a nice head and nice retention. Leaves some lacing on the glass. The aroma is malty and fruity. Orange mostly, some yeast, and some alcohol. Very nice aroma. The flavor was malty and sweet but very well balance with a subtle hop character. The mouthfeel and drinkability for this beer are great."
"The one poured a nice amber red color with one finger of head. The nose is both sweet and spicey, with some cherries coming through most prominently. The taste is great, a nice peppery spice, sweet caramel, sweet cherry. A treat to be consumed. The mouthfeel was moderate to thick. Drnkability is huge on this. I will be getting a few more of these next time I see them."
"Brown in hue with noticeable tawny influences, when held to a light a lovely ruby tint develops. At this point I could notice some suspended yeast sediment in the dense liquid. The head was beige in color, frothy, at the apex of the foam reached almost two fingers in height. Head retention was decent, after a few moments it faded to a modest cap. This cap lasted the entire consumption, impressive. However, subsequent lacing wasnt that impressive, there were a few patches and that was about all. Still the appearance is excellent. Eye-candy. Sometimes the potency of the nose in big beers is disappointing to me, it is never as lively as I like. Very few Belgian beers have lived up to my expectations when it comes to pure potency of the bouquet. I am very pleasant to say, the power of the smells of this ale is second to none! Wow! The nose has strong malty aromas. Not only is the malt deep, it is very wide with so many layers! At no time does the malt standalone. The sweet chocolate is infused with cinnamon and orange. Sugar cookies. Coffee cakes soaked in OSA, you pick the vintage. Yeasty. Lemony at the back with a trace of mustiness. To say this nose is inviting is an understatement. I dont take sips of the beer until Im done writing about the nose. I seriously had to force the glass away from my mouth. But finally, Im done writing and I can take a drink. Allow me to pause The palate is very, very good. I thought Abbaye Des Rocs was fantastic. While Im not going to compare the two, I will say the palate of the Grand Cru is not as impressive. With that said, the palate is surprisingly spicy. Cinnamon, ginger, coriander, peppery qualities too that play devilishly well with the fruitiness. Melons, grapes, figs, and dates laced with brandy, dusted with brown sugar. There is a doughiness that reminds me of OSA bread I made once. Oranges stand alone from the other fruit as it comes off with a liqueur quality to it. The malt is not as deep as the nose lead on, I am disappointed about that; yes, I like the sweetness of the chocolate but I need more than that. Sure the maltiness is nothing to complain about, beside that I find it a tickle shallow. Since the rest of this beer is near perfection whining about the malt seems to be nitpicking. Maybe it is. But I did anyway. The aftertaste is modestly hot; this is the only point of the beer that the alcohol seems noticeable. But no way does it come across at 10% abv. Otherwise the aftertaste is a mix of fruit and spice. Very nice, it reminds me of alcoholic marmalade. Is it complex? Yes but it could be more multifaceted. Would I drink this again? Hell yes! But seriously, more malt backbone is needed. Medium in body, fizzy carbonation that plays perfectly with the spice and fruit; I am very impressed, however, it is too thin. The mouthfeel has fizz but no pizzazz. I really enjoyed this beer. It is great. I understand why this beer is in the BA Top 15. Amazingly tasty and equally as drinkable but, me personally, give me the regular Abbaye Des Rocs! I purchased a bottle in Burnsville, MN for $8.40. Recommended."
"Later note: Too much protein/yeast glop seems to plague a lot of bottles of this beer as of late."
"Bottle, thanks to mat. Just tasted like regular Abbaye des rcos, which is a good thing, great fruitcake, spice aroma, great hous yeast. Gotta love this stuff. Well, yes of course it seemed a little sweeter and fuller than the regular, but there isn't a huge difference."
"This came in a green 750ml bottle. The body was a deep brown with reddish highlights and a giant fluffy off white head peaking over the top of the glass. As this was consumed sticky rings of lacing were left hung around the glass. Very good head retention as even the last sips had a nice covering of the fluffy head still floating. The smell was sweet with a slight spice to it as well as strong fruit notes. The taste started off with a fruity caramel sweetness that mingled with a bit of spice and yeast flavors. Not overly sweet but just right, the aftertaste is a bit tart as well. Very good taste with a lot of things going on that I will have to have this again to pick up on more of them. This almost has a full body but just falls short not that it hurts it in any way, and its very rich and creamy on the tongue. This stuff was way too drinkable to be 10%, no real hints of the alcohol anywhere. I will have to pick up a few more bottles of this to keep around."
"Ruby-brown body with substantial carbonation and a soft spumous buffy head. Sweet aroma of vanilla, rum, bubble gum, cherries, caramel malt, yeast, candy sugar, maple, flowers, and wet grass. Wow. Basically I can smell most things that I can think of here. Big malty flavor but less sweet than expected. Has some leathery bitterness and a turpentine quality that reminds me of Orval. Freaking delicious. Nice long finish. Smooth, round body. I'm a sucker for a great Belgian Strong Ale."
"Drinkability: For a beer this size, there's not much hint of alcohol. But the flavor doesn't just blow me away. It's solid, but nothing spectacular. Which means that this is a beer I'd return to, but not in a much anticipated, overly enthusiastic way."
"A big thank you to Rajendra82 for the trade!"
"Carefully poured from a long-standing bottle its body is a brilliant dark ruby/chestnut beneath a creamy cap of off-white (almost tan) foam. The head retention is quite good, and it leaves splashes of lace about the glass. The nose combines a sweetish, caramel-dripped and subtly buttery biscuit-like maltiness with some fairly bold fruitiness (flashes of orange, raspberries, cherry, and a waft of lime). It's airy in the mouth with a combination of dextrinous mouthfeel and CO2 breakout that billows up softly and then fades away with just a light zest on the palate. A richer maltiness and some exceptionally nice, delicately spicy alcohol appear in the flavor; as well as some floral hop notes and wider range of fruitiness (papaya, cocoanut and pineapple perhaps?, and some green apple). It's much more balanced (less sweet) than the standard Abbaye Des Rocs; and it offers exceptional drinkability with a certain level of richness and complexity that does not overwhelm the tastebuds but certainly keeps you coming back for more. It finishes dry with some lingering alcohol spice (although the alcohol never hinders!) and maltiness that reminds you of the beautiful flavors you've just savored. This is an exceptional beer that probably deserves more notoriety, and should not be missed. Brilliant!"
"750mL bottle poured into a tulip-style glass. It pours a deep ruby red color with four fingers of off-white foam. There is lots and lots of lacing, which is something you don't see out of too many high alcohol brews. The smell has lots of sweet plum, cherry, and red grape mixed with a subtle but solid alcohol aroma. The taste has lots of malt and sweetness, more of those fruit flavors coming through. The different tastes are very layered, and come together very nice in the finish with just a splash of ethanol. The mouthfeel is thick and strong, yet smooth as silk. The drinkability lacks some due to the 10% coming through, but who cares? This is a brew I could sip on for hours!"
"Taste: Very spritzy initially, with slight alcohol burn. Sweet initially, but dries out quickly after the swallow. Oaky, with vanilla notes accentuated by the strong presence of alcohol bite, which also seems to accentuate the spice matrix. Caramel and toffee nose through in the finish. After-finish is dry, crisp, and known to induce a desire for another sip."
"A bold roasted, caramel malt initial taste is replaced by a toffee flavor at midtaste and remains to the end. Grain and menthol influences blend in and out throughout the taste. A nice alcohol warmth emerges as the flavor fades. A complex flavor overall, is enhanced by exceptional carbonation. A very drinkable brew."
"This is a hell of a Grand Cru and a great beer....what I wouldn't do to be a millionaire with a cellar full of about 100 of these on hand at all times..."
"Full and thick, I couldn't drink a lot but it's very good and the 750 ml afforded me a second glass to enjoy with a cigar."
"Sampled 4/2/04"
"Poured a deep brown with strong ruby highlights. Head was off-white, and quickly receded to the edge of the glass. The smell was dark rum and fruity, a very faint toasted caramel malt, lots of sweetness masking a very fainy alcohol. The flavor is medicinal bitterness at the front, followed by a huge spice wave, and brief sweeping sweet dark malt, and a tongue pounding alcohol finish. Whoa. The first sip, everything goes by so quickly, the mouth cannot keep up. Earthy yeast character becomes present in the beginning after the second sip, and a wave of dark fruit takes over the middle of the tongue. Mouthfeel is similar to the Burgundy Ale, very sharp and crisp, bordering astringent. Very carbonated and prickly on the tongue. If someone asked me to choose between the two, I'd recommend to buy both and decide for yourself. The alcohol finish is a bit much for me on this one, but everything up to it is angelic."
"Drinkability: Who couldn't drink this beer. Its just fantastic and goes down oh so smoothly."
"This ale hints at brandy and reminds me of something under the tree on Christmas morning, full of rare spice and excitement. A magnificent creation."
"Poured a reddish amber color with a small white head that did not leave any lacing. Aroma of dark fruit, also including apples as well as some alcohol. The taste was very vinous, but also including tastes of apples, plums, grapes, slight chocolate and some alcohol was welcomed as the beer warmed alittle (way to cold when initially served). Also present as it warmed were some spices and some candy sugar."
"pours a very, very nice cloudy amber colour with a fairly large tan head. stickiness was nice as well. this one looked like it was goign to be big and bold. the re is a nice fruit smell here wit ha hint of sour grapes and some spice notes. bits of wood, butter and caramel were also detected. this one was damn tasty as well, with sweetness up front, dry earth in the middle and back. the middle has some burnt wood flavour as well. it's smooth and creamy, which i was a bit surprised about, but won't complain about either. also surpsing was the fatc that thre was no real alcohol flavour present, especially considering the 10% abv. an excellent brew overall."
"this was one outstanding ride. very very similar to westy 8 in my opinion and at 7.99 a 750 compared to 8.99 for a 12ounce bottle of westy this dog will hunt. I will definitley be drinking this one over and over."
"An interesting beer. Im not really crazy about it. Very sweet and malty, it actually kind of reminded me of a cross between a barleywine and classic belgian. Nice beer, just not my cup of tea."
"Nice looking ruby brew with a long lasting off white head. Aroma is biscuity, malty, sour and slightly fruity with a musty touch. Flavor is very complex whith overripe fruit, bannana, melon and more. The malty, sweet taste gives way to a spicy then sour finish. Mouthfeel is moderate. I rate it above average in taste and drinkability only because it is a very engaging beer. Theres so much going on that its hard to put down even if it does taste a bit funky."
"Update: The beer is now available in 330 ml. four packs in Georgia, so I decided to try it again (since I had traded away that other 750 ml. bottle picked up in Chattanooga). Either the beer was more fresh, or my palette had evolved, but gone was the cloying sweetness that bothered me so much last time. Instead this bottle displayed a perfect balance between sweet, spicy, tart, yeasty, and bitter flavors. 9.5% ABV was not evident anywhere in the taste. I certainly enjoyed it a lot better this time. And the heady carbonation, and the resulting full burps were an outstanding finishing touch. And there was no way to sip this one. It just begged to be quaffed. Liquid Crack."
"A great find at Monk's back bar. It poured a clear, dark brown with some reddish tint and a good light head. The aroma is malty and has a lot of dark ripe fruit. It starts with the dark fruit (plum and raisin especiall) and then it gets a little spicy with some anise and a touch of choclate and caramel. It was exquisitley smooth and went great with dessert."
"Very cool having this beer on-tap, thanks to FeloniousMonk for getting a keg of this for the Nile."
"The feel was full, round and creamy, no doubt due to the fine effervescence. Overall, quite a tasty strong dark ale. I can't envision drinking it very often, but for a special occasion it would be great."
"While I generally do not like to keep repeating myself and fall back on the descriptors, this flavor is deep. And just as impressive as the profundity is the artfully blended balance of a number of components. You drink it, and as a reward it caresses the palate, and that's why sipping this is an addictive enterprise. But yes, take note, I did say sipping, because that's certainly the way to go. The potent ABV tries its best to hold you back, but the sense want more, and in my case, they gladly get it. As long as the flavor's warm glow may linger, the contented smile my memory brings to my lips will remain even longer."
"Very drinkable brew, a sipper not a chug beer."
"A fine beer all around. Though it seems to be a bit of a Westy clone, that's not exactly an insult. A nice presence and a very low price make this one that I'd gladly have again."
"Poured a deep cherry stained mahogony color with a volumenous, rocky, yellowish, off-white head with craggy valleys and hills and plenty of sticky lace. Smell was effervescent sweetness, a lot of grassy barnyard notes, a lemony tartness way in the back of the nose and some whiffs of cherry and orange peel. Taste was plenty estery(10% is a lot) with more sweetness, dried fruits, slightly grainy, tart finish with an aftertaste that moved back and forth between a woody smoke laden pallete and a slight metallic/soapy effect. Mouthfeel was creamy, but agressivly carbonated with the small bubbles all over the place. Of the grand crus I have tried this one struck me as the most banal. Maybe I just like the american intepretation better, but I thought the Southampton blew this out of the water and the Allagash a close second. Gotta find me some of that Rodenbach."
"Appearance is a murky brown, even more so when pouring the immense amount of yeast into the chalice (which helped a lot to release the subtleties of the awesome aroma). It seems paler than the regular abbaye des rocs. Relatively high apparent carbonation level, huge head with irregular bubbles, but quite spectacular. It slowly fades away, but still sticks to the glass. Aroma is very complex if not too intense. This is ultimate belgian goodness and balance between brown sugar malt sweetness and yeast funkiness. Ultra-complex fruity profile (berries, cherries, plums, pears, apples), very spicy also (sage, parsley, cinnamon cake). That's all great by itself, but what makes the aroma truly unique is how it combines the above flavours with the belgian farmhouse character from the yeast which lends it a unique hay-ish and floral side that I love, almost a Fantome. The taste also contains this good dose of funk and spicy unexplainable weirdness, wet fieldish hay drying under the sun, pepper grains, basil, thyme? full of subtleties and perhaps the apotheosis of a spiced belgian strong dark ales with masterfully hidden alcohol, very sweet, bready and yeasty with a creamy, silky crème caramel medium-full body. Plain delicious and worthy of world-class status."

"What a great chance to have this on tap yoday at a Belgian beer dinner at the Spring House Drafting Room.Pours a rich brown color with a sticky head,aroma was rich and nutty with some nice warming alcohol with some fruity estures.This Belgian Dark has a real nice hop profile to go along with a rich nutty flavor and some spicey/yeasty notes.Glad to finally try this beer and it was on tap to boot."
"A very good beer, and a complex one at that. Enjoyed this with my nephew (and fellow BA) Dennis as our after-dinner beer. Poured out to a copper/amber color in the glass with a generous head. There was quite a bit of floating yeast in the glass as well. The aroma is fantastic with notes of plum, raisins and bread dough coming to the forefront. The taste is exceptional as well, with said fruits mentioned also being present on the taste. The ABV is well hidden and it got better as it warmed. We made my father, an O'Doul's and Miller Lite drinker taste this and his only comment was, ""Skunk piss."" Oh well, I guess you can't teach an old dog new tricks. As for this dog, I will drink this one again, anyday. Delicious."

"Abbaye Des Rocs Grand Cru was served from a green 750 ml bottle into a Duvel tulip. The beer was an attractive deep reddish-orange hue and was topped with a rocky tan head that left thick and fine lacing. The nose was powerful and loaded with funky spices such as clove, star anise, and orange peel...an overall medicinal effect. Underlying the spice was a smell resembling decaying detritis and earth. The flavor profile was extremely complex. A rich and lively sweetish malt body contained flavors of dried fruit, raisins, molasses, scotch, and slim jim spice. The finish was satisfying, with a good bitter cap and lingering clove maltiness. The body was very full and silky smooth, with fluffy carbonation. The Grand Cru was a challenging beer, and grew on me by leaps and bounds as I drank and acquired a taste for it...distinctive, unique, and very complex. I found it similar to the regular version in its flavor/spice, but much better overall."
" This is simply an amazing beer. The drive and service I dealt with to get this were very unpleasant, but I just may have to do it again. This is a not to miss beer."
"Mouthfeel is great, smooth and creamy, very chewy. Given the 10% ABV deceptively easy to drink a 750ml bottle. Drinkability rates very high but it is a very filling beer."
"Poured a giant light brown head that was very active and foamy. The head left a smattering of lace as it sank back into the opaque mahogany beer from which it came. Tangy aroma, a bit of pepper, Soft and smooth mouthfeel to the beer and a medium body. Plums, spiced orange peels, and creamy malt make up the flavor which is followed by a moderately bitter aftertaste. A sort of metalic sensation hits at the beginning of the aftertaste. Hardly any hint of the alcohol at hand. A very fine beer, the blend of flavors along with the mouthfeel of this beer make for one awesome combination."
"Poured with gusto into the glass, raising a massive rocky ivory colored head over cloudy reddish/brown liquid. Lots of malt in the nose, with notes of brown sugar and horse blanket yeast esters. The taste is layers of fruity and malty sweetness mixed with hints of black pepper and chocolate. Alcohol is very well cloaked here. Finishes lightly bitter with residual maltiness. Mellow yet complex."
"FANTASTIC!"
"Taste is very complex and incerdibly inticing. Whew, what a mouthfull of things going on here. Simply amazing and fine with nothing to overpowering really other then the alcohol hitting fast as it goes down very nicely with a smooth zesty fullness that begins to make your head swoon just after half a glass and there's yet a whole nother serving in that 750ml bottle yet to come, oh boy...a long night ahead. Flavors are quick to enter with sharpening tones of citrus zest from lemon and orange with some light pineapple, white grapes, dulled grapefruit, and sweet mango inscribed within the mix along with small added notes of yeasty spicyness with kinda of a peppery, clove, nutmeg, citrus peel zest thing. Lots of zest! Lots of softened spicyness. And what makes it even more remarkable is there seems to be a very nice dark malty sweetness of toffee/caramel that kinda keeps those spices from getting out of control and too strong. Beautiful medley of flavors that intermingle and dance with each other in perfect harmony. Full bodied feel with a bit of sharpness and yeastyness that takes away just a nudge for me, but not by much. So goes the feel so goes the drinkability, in most cases anyways, and it does with me with this, by just another nudge mainly due to the untraceable alcoholic effect this has and smallish sharp tone of zest and yeast. But damn this is some very good stuff! Thank you very much ManekiNeko!!"
"Medium bodied with a soft carbonation that makes this a very drinkable offering. The 10% alcohol is hidden well until it warms up the stomach. Very well done."
"As David Farnsworth (owner of Lucky Baldwin's) put it, ""This is liquid heaven, is there anything better?"" My only response is ""Yup.. to be having it in Belgium."" Heigh thee forth to Lucky's and get a sip of this, but if you don't do it soon David will have drunk it all. Jeez.. my first 5."
" I wish it would never end."
"Review #666 - More Beer Vicar?? Vicar !"
"Cheers! - Maybrick"
"Brownish ruby in color with a nose that screams: ""I'm the finest chocolate covered cherry you'll ever come across."" Not alot of head or lace retention though, but the taste is knock out! Again, chocolate covered cherries. Gobs of kirsch liquor, bitter chocolate-the good stuff, and throw in a freshly laundered horse blanket to keep this one honest! A rather fruit driven offering with delicious malt flavors and a very fine velvety texture. This sucker goes down easy and gets tastier as it goes down. As the beer finishes it displays a hot buttered rhum like profile. Good heat, slick texture and a hint of spice. If this don't warm ya up, I don't know what will."
"Before I get to the specific review, let me note that Grand Cru is NOT a style. It simply means the best beer from the brewery. The fact that this beer, Rodenbach Grand Cru, and Hoegaarden Grand Cru are all listed in the same category proves how useless the definition is. This beer is more of an strong belgian ale, with a color right on the border between pale and dark. Appearance: Beautiful reddish-orange color. Big, thick, creamy had, with very good retention, and noticeable lace. Aroma: complex spiciness, and a candy-like sweetness. Flavor: sweet, caramel, with a balancing tartness and spiciness. Mouthfeel: creamy, rich, with a nice dryness from the spicing in finish. Drinkability: The delicate balancing act that this beer performs makes it incredibly easy to drink for such a strong beer."
"Pours with a thick tannish head. A beautiful deep garnet color with a slight chill haze to it. This beer smells fruity (apricot being the most predominant aroma, followed by orange). There is a certain candy sweet aroma as well, maybe a hint of butterscotch. This beer has an outstanding aroma and I could just sniff it for ages. As I sniff it the head has barely lost its 2 inch thickness, it is well carbonated. There is a bit of maltiness in the aroma as well. It is definitely well carbonated tasting as well. It is lightly sweet, with a fruitiness that was promised in the nose. There is both a candied apricot and orange flavor here. There is also a slight sense of the alcohol in this one. The taste doesn't quite live up to the aroma but this beer still need to warm up a bit. I detect a hint of astringency in the finish, there seems to be some nice Belgian yeast fermentation byproducts here as well. The beer has some slight Belgian lacing in evidence as I slowly work my way to the bottom of the glass. As it warms up the beer becomes softer, though the alcohol is still evident. Becomes sweeter and maltier. the beer color clears up a bit as it warms too, it displays some nice orange hues as it is held up to the light."
"This was my wife's first true Belgian beer. I couldn't be happier that I chose this as her introduction. My first Abbaye des Rocs, and far from my last. Finally, perfection!"
"750ml corked bottle. Deep amber with a reddish hue and tan head. Superb aroma of fruit and malty caramel. Dried figs,cherries and something nutty. Lively carbonated mouthfeel and a full body. Has a nice warming sensation. This is a high quality Belgian. Nice."
"This had a great cherry and cotton candy aroma on the nose. The beer has a nice head on it with the color hinting at cherries as well. The cherry was a little less apparent in the flavor but the candy sugar flavor ther, almost a brown sugar flavor. It was a little too sweet almost."
" Full bodied with incredibly intense, complex flavors Ive found in no other beer. A truely remarkable and highly recomended Grand Cru, however, I drank a full bottle on my own ( it was just too good to stop!) and it put me on my butt. Enjoy with food and friends is my advice."
"Everything about this beer is great. From the label to the bottle to the taste. I served this beer in a tulip glass, not sure if that is correct but it worked."
"This rare beauty pours an orange-tinted amber with a firm rocky beige head, and tons of sticky lace. The aroma is complex mix of crushed berries, damp earth, apples, sweet malt and light alcohol esters. A candy sweet flavor melds with fresh bread, caramel apples, mild lime-like bitterness, light pine, a hint of chocolate, and an ever so faint astringent camphor taste. A warming alcohol works its way through the crowded flavor field. The mouthfeel is buttery and smooth just after an initial fizzy effervescence. This should be a ""must try"" beer."
"Drinkability: Freeyow! I picked a good 'un for #50. I picked up an extra bottle of this for a trade just to make sure the supply wasn't skunked (green bottle, ya know). At $7 a pop, I'll definitely be picking up a few bottles of this for the cellar."
"This one was dark brown with a huge candy sugar aroma mixed with a sourish, spicy yeast. Smooth was the key word here, medium bodied with sweet dark fruit flavors (plums and cherries) with nice bubbly carbonation and a long fruity finish drying with cinnamon,vanilla and oak, and so very slightly acidic in a nice way. A very complex brew and very satisfying."
"Update - It's been awhile since I updated this wonderful ale so popped a 2007 in 2008 and decided to compare. It is as great as ever and that collection of fruit flavors is unbelievable."
"Poured a resplendent mahogany color, with a head that exploded and then fell faster than any beer Ive ever seen. Had tons of carbonation so the cream-colored foamy head sat well. Surprisingly, had mediocre lace. Smelled of cherries, oak, and an alcohol scent, but rounded nicely. Taste was oaky from middle through finish, with a nice true cherry flavor up front. Tasted some roast and green flavors at the end  hops, yeast, both?. Left an oily and creamy coating on the tongue. A decent example of the style, but a bit basic and not as fascinating as some others (Allagash, hmmmm....)"
"Fruity caramel nose. On the initial pour there is a huge fluffy beige head. Deep plum color with lots of carbonation in the goblet. Rich regal smelling. Fruity mango-ish sweet malt taste. Rich smooth malty mouth. Quite full on the tongue as well. Overall very regal tasting. Rich, fruity, full and inviting. One to snuggle up to... Slight touch of white pepper in the finish. Nice."
"orginally sampled on 25 March 2003. Huge white head w/ big bubbles & a slightly hazy golden brown color are the first things that catch your eye. It's very thick on the tongue, notes of honey & dried fruit abound. It has some complexity, but not on the order of some other well known beers. It's an elegant brew."
"This beer poured a very dark brown amber color and formed a huge bubbly off white head that left laticed lace as it subsided. A large amount of carbonation and some sediment is present. It has a wonderful aroma of malt, caramel, raisins and other fruit with a touch of pepper. A heavy flavor of malt, caramel, raisins and a warming touch of the alcohol. The finish is of a medium body and slightly sweet and creamy with a warm aspect of the alcohol present. Another one I wish we could see in Ohio with our new laws and I think I picked a winner for my 500th review."
"Medium brown color. Medium head. Aroma is fruity and malty. Big bodied Belgian. Malty and very fruity. Traces of raisins, pears, peaches, apricots and more. Spices were coriander, peppers, brown sugar and chocolate. Extremely smooth, very creamy. Hides the 10% alcohol very well. There is a touch of an alcohol bite, but it could just be the peppers. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is very smooth. Aftertaste is slightly sweet."
"Amber color with offwhite head -- not nearly as carbonated as I was expecting for some reason. Baskets of ripened plums. Sugary sweet aroma pushes into a sweet palate highlighted by the way roses might taste if one were to eat roses. Something of an herbal tea taste. While more fruity in aroma, very floral in taste -- if that makes sense. I suspect that the semi-sweet finish is derived from some type of hops -- not really bitter but not really sweet. Just delicately balanced. Chunks of yeast sediment settle around the bottom of the glass but are easily stirred -- gives the beer a slightly heavier feel as you gulp a little much of it at the end. All in all, the sweetness is a tad powerful. But considering the abv on this, it's impressively well done."

"Yippie! Id been looking forward to this one for a while, but it takes a special occasion to break open a bottle this big of a brew this potent. On second thought, no it doesnt. Being alive is occasion enough! Lovely garnet in color with some sediment floating about. Medium sized, light tan head fades to a moderate, creamy and persistent top. The aroma is simply to die for. Malty sweet, maybe a bit nutty, with a healthy dose of candi sugar and a deep fruitiness. God I love these Grand Crus. Taste starts off sweetly malty, perhaps just a bit toasty, then becomes fruity with an ever-so-slight hint of tartness. Lightly peppery toward the finish. Sheesh, is there alcohol in this beer at all? If there is, its damn hard to find amidst the big creamy and oh-so-smooth body. Delicious. Treat yourself to a bottle  if you havent done something to deserve it yet, this beer will certainly inspire you to do so!"

"Big 750 ml Euro bottle. Deep mahogoney roasted brown color. Subtle hints of ruby along the edges. Head was thick, dense, full, beige and creamy. Super smooth looking beer. Aromas of fruit, rum soaked rasins, and big malty sweetness. First taste had a shot of high abv heat. Settled into a creamy full malty sweet and balanced beer. Hints of plums, candied apples, rum soaked rasins, and full yeasty goodness. Lots of suspended particles, I think helped the alcohol settle down. Nice crisp, bitter finish. Then the alocohol presence shows again in your belly. Super smooth, creamy, full bodied beer. Silky. A top notch beer in every respect. Worth the wait, I've had it in my fridge now for 7 months. I will seek this one out again."
"Another fine example of a great style. Very creamy, full bodied and sweet. Alcohol not noticeable in taste, but in effect! Goes down easy, flavorful and subtle. Different enough to distinguish itself. An excellent Belgian, from a terrific brewery. Don't hesitate!"
"For my 100th review, I chose something from my favorite style that has been highly recommended to me. Let's see... Pours a deep mahogany brew, which is slightly hazy. A thick cream-colored head forms on top. A beautiful beer. The head retains quite well. Well, this has to be one of the best beer aromas I've ever smelled! All kinds of complexities in here. Most obvious I'd say is a sweet raisin aroma. Many spices are present that I wouldn't expect out of a beer in this style, but that just makes it all the more unique and wonderful. Kind of hard to place, but I'd say cinnamon, allspice, nutmeg... things like that. It's also very fruity, like passion fruit or something tropical. There's a hint of sourness in there as well. Maybe some banana? It's just a pleasure to sit back and take in this aroma! Now for the flavor. A wave of caramel sweetness with the aforementioned spice twang riding in on top enters your mouth ever so smoothly. A bit of hop bitterness is detectable when it hits the middle. Cherry bourbonish flavor. Dark fruits are present throughout (raisin and plum). Some berries here and there. Slightly bready in the malt department besides the caramel. Wonderful mouthfeel. Smooth, thick, and rich. The finish is just as smooth as the rest. I want to say it's full-bodied, but it's so subtle. I'd say medium-full. I would never have guessed at the 10% abv if I hadn't looked at the bottle. A great beer to relax with, incredibly drinkable. Overall, this is one of the best beers I've ever tasted! An excellent pick for my 100th, I must say. I'm speechless!"
"Now this is what Belgian beer is all about. It pours a beautiful reddish brown with a smallish head that disappears rather quickly. The smell is absolutely remarkable, with floral, fruit, and pepper/spice aromas on top of a slightly musty smell. I was almost afraid to start drinking it out of fear that I'd be left without that wonderful smell. However, the taste makes the next step more than worth it. Cherries, flowers, caramel, pepper, and a host of other flavors swim around and work together perfectly in this spectacular beer. The alcohol is warming but certainly not overwhelming; it doesn't taste or smell like a 10% beer. If you see this don't leave without out it. I can't wait to try the other beers from Abbaye des Rocs."
"To start with... the appearance of this beer is excellent. Pours a moderate brown colour which is topped with a nice head which settles rather easily. The smell is quite good with hints of caramel. The taste is simply STRONG and makes your mouth really feel this beer. A very good Dark Strong Ale with 10% alcohol level. Especially with this beer DON'T drink and drive"
"I wonder how this might pair with a ripe real Epoisses(?). A Taleggio in good condition might be easier to get a hand on though..."
"The pour a clear deep garnet, the head pythonic in size, frothy, long lasting, the lace in lusty sheets that last till the last drop is wringed from the bottom of the glass. Nose has a nice sweet malt aroma along with hints of over ripe plums, earthy, exceptionally ""Sniffable"". Front is engagingly sweet, the top light, the finish is forcefully acidic, cleverly hopped, the aftertaste droughty. A great beer, that deserves a try, the high ABV, not really noticeable, but the 25.4 ounces in a setting can be a bit overwhelming!"
"Cloudy brown with floating and suspended yeasties. Head is quickly reduced to a creamy, swirly layer of foam. Aroma consists primarily of dark ripe fruits, carmelized sugar and a whiff or two of alcohol. Initial taste is tart with tight carbonation. Mouthfeel smooths out as the brew warms. Flavors are a blend of fruity esters; raisins, prunes, dates and a bit of a yeasty tartness. A mild ethanol burn follows each sip. The sweetness of this beer has moments of stickiness, but is never cloying. Not quite as spicy as some grand crus, but a solid, very tasty dark Belgian strong ale."
"Two fingered, uniform off white head tops a clear dark ruby hued brew if decanted off the yeast. True lace is left down the glass. Crisp, vibrant fruity esters reminescent of slightly unripe raspberries and citrus in aroma, accompanied by sweet biscuit and notes of buttery malt. Heaty alcohol is perceptible only with a deep inhalation. As the brew breathes the aroma takes on a floral, red rose - like character. Very enticing, and highly appetizing aromawise. Fruity sweetness upfront in flavor yields to a light malt profile comprised of bready and buttery malt. Sweetness becomes floral and perfume like mid palate. When combined with the malt profile, I am reminded of raspberry preserves on rustic bread. Moderate to full in body, with a smooth mouthfeel lent both by the relatively low carbonation and residual dextrins. Hop bitterness is appropriately low and would only detract from the layered sweetness. Yeast fermentation byproducts are surprisingly mild and consist of trace green apple acetaldehyde only. Finishes pleasantly sweet, w/ lingering rose petal notes. Abbaye de Rocs has produced a stellar Grand Cru. It's complex and enjoyably sweet, yet unbelievably clean, with a striking deep floral character. The drinkability is simply unparalleled."
"Pure enjoyment from the 1st sip.  The aroma was that of fresh baked fruitcake.   The taste was like chocolate covered cherries, with it starting off sweet and finishing dry.  The creamy texture stays in your mouth and in your glass forever. I took a chance on this beer and it was a chance worth taking, truly an amazing tripel, and a must have no matter what time of year."
