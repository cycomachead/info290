"Overall, great tasting beverage, hides its strength well with great malt presence and subtle yeast off flavors."

"From my tasting notes: New Belgiumâ€™s Abbey Ale is one of their best beers and this one kicks it up a few notches. It has a very deep and intense flavor that strikes all the right Belgian Abbey notes with hints of raisins, figs, and that distinct Belgian yeast. I remember having this on draft previously and it blew my socks off. The bottled version, while still fantastic, didn't quite blow me away. Still a great beer."

"Bottle: Poured a clear brown color ale with a large foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of dry caramel malt with a bready yeast is interesting. Taste is dominated by dry caramel malt notes with very subtle residual sugar notes and some bready notes. Body is about average with good carbonation and light warming alcohol can be detected. I am not sure where all those high ratings are coming from. I was expecting more complexity from the yeast ester which I could find here and I thought the beer was too dry for the style."

"Belgian lace covers the glass round of this ruby colored beer. Nose is sweet, yeasty, very Belgian styled. More specifically, notes of sweet cherry and dark malt sweetness. The flavor offers some cherry and chocolate notes, a little heat from the alcohol to keep the sweet flavor in check, and is complemented with a full, yet silky body. Quite nice indeed."
""

"Very clear ruby with no head, but is coaxed out with a swirl. Tan and clings to the glass. Lots of sweet candied sugar, confectionary sugar, like a red vine. A little cedar and some berries; strawberry and cherries, all this is faint though. Tastes like a double. Pungent and bordering on too sugary as it warms. Light body and dry finish. Very good cold to middle, dies a little warm. This one was hinting towards interesting but ultimately isn't something special."
""
"This is quite tangy and sweet. There seem to be a lot of melon tones to it on the nose and tight nectarine ones on the flavor. It works as a Belgian ale, but it's a bit loud and not entirely smooth with such a boisterous profile. Easy to drink, but a bit too loud to be considered entirely smooth."
""

"O- A good offering from Lips of Faith, but not their best offering."
""
"O - A strong resemblance of regular Abbey. Good beer, but really just in that 3.5 range."
"Good flavor but ultimately unimpressive."

"I think I might not be partial to the style -- I've been disappointed with Trois Pistoles, Maudite, and Brother Thelonious. And now this. (But wait, I love La Terrible.)"
"On-tap at the brewery. I was really impressed. Smooth, clean, and dangerous. Deep notes of toffee, caramel, carob, anise, and milk chocolate. Bitterness is mild and hops lend just a hint of earth and herb. Cinnamon and clove spiciness add plenty of depth. Where the hell is the alcohol? Complex and satisfying."
""
""
""
""
""
"The sweetness and in your face Belgian phenols and esters leave this one a slow, laborious sipper for me. I prefer my Belgian Dark strong ales with much more dark fruit malt complexity and much less banana and clove forward. Alcohol is a bit too overstated as well. Not a top notch American-made Belgian style ale and not worth seeking out."

"{2nd bottle consumed July 2013 - delicious. Light revision of rating}"

"Overall - A really enjoyable beer that I would drink again in a heartbeat. It rivals some of the beers within this style from Belgium. Worth picking up."
""

"D - Very drinkable. Surprisingly smooth with a nice super rich malty flavor. The balance is really nice all around."

"O-good solid beer loaded with flavor and complexity"

"Abbey Grand Cru pours a dark ruby-brown with a dense off-white head that leaves tons of lace. Fruity aromas of banana and clove are off-set by caramel malt, dark fruit, alcohol, and even some bubble gum. Malty sweetness dominates the pallet, with spice, clove, banana, bubble gum, alcohol, and a hint of citrus noticeable. A dry finish is met with medium amounts of carbonation in this medium-light bodied ale. Very complex and delicious, this brew supposedly comes around every 1000 barrels, and we cannot wait for more!"
""
""
"O: I was impressed by this beer -- the pear juice is undoubtedly there but is measured and the double Fat Tire base pushes the body up without overdoing the caramel sweetness. I would definitely buy this again and look forward to seeing if a year or two does anything to my other bottle."
""
"Smelled amazing. Great beer overall, excellent job."

"Poured from a 22 oz bottle into a goblet, not sure of the bottle date but probably 6 - 12 months old. This pours a dark brown color with a decent off white head. The smell is pretty good, some dark fruit, sugar, Belgian yeast esters, a good Belgian copy. The feel is medium to thick, high carbonation. The taste is pretty good, dark brown sugar, dark ripe fruit."
"Reviewed on: 03-07-2011 17:58:42"
"22 ounce bottle into tulip, no bottle date. Pours a clear, yet finely cloudy, reddish orange color with a nice 2 finger fairly dense off white head with good retention that reduces to a thin cap. Some decent lacing on the glass. Aromas of big banana, molasses, caramel, clove, pepper, plum, cherry, apple, bread, light fruits, and yeast spices. Some nice and well balanced Belgian aromas. Taste of big molasses, nuttiness, banana, clove, caramel, raisin, light fruits, biscuit, pepper, and yeast spices. Lingering notes of light fruits, pepper, clove, banana, and molasses on the finish for a good bit. Not overly spicy from the yeast at all; yet still has nice balance with no cloying sweetness. Slightly above medium carbonation and medium bodied; with a slightly creamy and slick mouthfeel. Very smooth to drink but it is still a bit of a sipper. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming well after the finish. Overall this is a very excellent Belgian style offering. Great flavor balance and complexity; with smooth drinkability for the level of alcohol."

"This was a good-looking beer with little else going for it, in my opinion. At least I didn't hold onto this for any longer."
"Overall a sweet strong ale with a nice mix of flavors, but mostly reminded me of a alcohol infused Bazooka Bubble Gum..."
"m- medium bodied, and overall, pretty well-balanced. i can hardly taste the alcohol, which is surprising considering the high abv (but i guess dangerous, too,"
""
""

"One of the first belgians I tried. Nice amber/bronze color with a thin bright white head that dissipates quickly. The nose brings a good hit of sugar and alcohol, with that classic Belgian tone. Sweet beer, sweet malts, a little bit of roastiness. Alcohol is pervasive throughout. Finishes dry. Like other belgian ales, it tastes better (to me) cold out of the fridge."
""
""
"Malty sweetness dominates the flavor. Hints of fruit, but lacks the spicy herbs that are the hallmark of this style. Decent body and not bad overall, but misses the mark on the style IMO. Just too sweet."
"O - It's a fine beer that doesn't bring anything very exciting or different to the table."
""

"3.5/3.5/3.5/3.5/3"
"A brownish red brew with a lot more foam than carbonation. The aroma was light, I was able to pick out grapefruit and plumb. The taste is close to what I remember. It hits strong with plumb, grapefruit, and a hint of cherry. There's also a slight sour element I don't remember from my first tasting. The body is thick and it doesn't hide the alcohol. This one is good but I'd rather go for Chimay if picking this style."
""
"Enjoy!"
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Not bad, not great. Ended up drinking like a boozy Saison. Since Saisons aren't all that complex as a low ABV style, it just doesn't make sense to boost the ABV on the style. I've had much better, much more complex Belgian Strongs. If it wasn't for the ABV, I would almost consider this a light drinking beer."
""
""
"o - overall a pretty solid american belgian strong dark ale. doesn't hold a candle to the classics, but enjoyable none-the-less and worth a try if you like the style."
""
"M - Some tingle from the carbonation and some serious bite from the booze. Not to the effect that it's unenjoyable or grimace-inducing, but it's definitely there and makes its presence known."

"New Belgium's Grand Cru Abbey Ale pours a good looking clear maroon color, with some nice amber highlights that shine through when given the occasion. The khaki foam that serves as a head comes up to between two and three fingers in height on the various pours. Head retention is just alright, and lacing is very inconsistent. There's a nice bit of plum in the nose, as well as a markedly peppery phenolic character. Those are joined by a slightly abrasive fusel alcohol aroma. There's just a hint of caramel to play off the dark fruits in the malty opening. The booziness from the nose is still present, but a little bit more subdued. It also serves to help highlight the prominent pepper notes in the close. The body is on the dry side, yet with a creamy edge to it, really nice for the style. The carbonation is just a touch too flat though, which keeps the beer from hanging with the best in terms of mouthfeel. Grand Cru Abbey Ale is a fairly well executed BSDA. That said, as someone who lives outside of New Belgium's distribution range, I wouldn't go out of my way to get my hands on some more of this over what's readily available here in NJ."

"Poured into my New Belgium goblet and man that sweet, Belgian sugar aroma is perfect. It is a dark brown but still can see thru it. The head settles quickly to just lacing. This is the aroma that made fall in love with Belgian ales. That sweet, buttery, toffee aroma with just a bit of banana and malts. Man, this one packs a punch. The alc is there but not too over powering. You get that sweet banana sugar taste with some Belgian malts and then a somewhat light finish. This is so good. Every sip is enjoyable at various temps. To me this is very drinkable but the alc does creep up on you. Really enjoy this one."

"D - Pretty standard for a spiced dark belgian. A little more spice character than I like but not bad."
"Overall: excellent drink ability. Not the best representative of its category but a very good beer overall."
"D - drinks a lot easier than the abv would suggest. Sweet, but not cloyingly so. I'd definitely suggest this one."
"Overall Impression- I'm VERY glad I was able to catch this one before it was never on-tap again! Always a shame that the Lips of Faith series is only a once released series of brews (except for finding stray bottles around all the time). I'm going to be getting more Growlers of this stuff so that I can enjoy more of it at a later date with friends. I suggest you do the same! Cheers!"
"O - A great Belgian-style brew overall, there's quite a bit going on here but, it never becomes too much; too cloying. Nuanced and quite tasty."
"I haven't been drinking abbey ales for a while, but it's cold and gloomy out today so I thought what the hell. I poured into a goblet and couldn't seem to produce much head. Fine lacing sticks to the glass a little while you drink. It's sitting in the goblet with a nice deep red hue. This beer has a lot of flavors going on in it. Very nice. I'll have to compare it to others of this style, it has been so long I'm not sure how this beer stacks up to the the best of this style, however, I'm extremely pleased to be drinking this at the moment. What a complex, balanced beer! Yum. Sit's on the mouth very lovely. I'm eating some alfredo sauce pizza with chicken/artichoke/tomato/feta/basil on it and it is pairing fantastically!"
"D/O - Well hidden but strong abv. Nice winter warming to it, both in a dark sugar malt base and some hot alcohol. A bit heavy but certainly enjoyable."
"Beer is medium in body but has a slightly dry finish. There is a mild grain bitterness at the end but the lead off here is some nice caramel with a strong body of yeast esters on the midpalate. Overall a very nice little beer, I'd have it again but probably not a whole bomber alone again."
"I'm glad to drink this on tap, but I'll be looking for some bottles to cellar before they're gone."
"This is a hefty-looking brewâ€”impressive lacing tops the dark amber, almost burgundy-colored ale. Hermit cookies, raisins, cotton candy, faint Band-Aid and green plantains. Creamy smoothness, a body almost like a fine sherry. Mildly boozy, alcohol stays mellow but very warming. Broth, bread and fruit, all of which are savory. Mild hopping, though the phenols help to balance. Plums? Ripe cherries? Sweetness is not overbearing; lots of layers peeling back here. Malty and spicy finish with more of that alcoholic warmth. Such a striking beer, but well maturedâ€”a choice pick, for sure."
"This is an average strong Belgian. Not enough body or complexity to rate the A's."
"Very credible effort."
"Overall this is a very good beer. It is not going to give you anything especially unique but it stays true to style and delivers an enjoyable drinking experience."
"Overall. Nice beer. Alcohol is very well hidden. Not my fav style but a good beer nonetheless."
"This pours deep copper almost brown color with not much of a head. No lacing on the glass. Smells of nuts, malts, and alcohol. Smell is not doing much for me. Taste is mediocre. Lots of malts and a syrupy texture. Some raisins and figs are also present. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and pretty well carbonated. Overall this just isn't doing that much for me. Some many amazing belgian darks out there that it needs to stand out to be remembered."
"The beer tastes a bit on the buttery side with a fair amount of hops. The beer finishes very well with a sweet malty-raison finish."
"Overall a very complex brew. A great late night brew with a cigar."
"Silky, smooth, medium mouthfeel. Hotter on the alcohol than I would have preferred. An excellent brew that I will be very happy to have again in the future."
"D: Perhaps I am just used to the regular Abbey from NBB, but I'm not convinced that the higher ABV serves this one any better. Still a solid brew...I would certainly give it a go. ABV is very well hidden."
"Overall: Unimpressive, I was tickled with Terroir but this and Clutch have been major disappointments."
"O- this is another sensational lips of faith. Great variety in flavors and hides abv well."
"I love New Belgium most of the time... they take the time to craft their specialty beers right, and their profit margin gives them ability to tweak recipes to the maximum effectiveness. In this case, they landed at the pinnacle."
"D ~ Didn't care for this one too much. Not very balanced, making it not very drinkable. I poured out my last 2oz to make room for better things. My first disappointment in the LoF series."
"This is a tasty Belgium-styled ale. Well done."
"Getting a B rating is not a bad thing - It only means it isn't amongst the best belgians I've had. However, I would drink this one anytime."
"This is thoroughly drinkable, well, sippable, with it's complex flavors and long spicy nose. This should be on everybody's must try list. Should taste this with the Lips Of Faith Dunkel Weiss to see if they're actually different beers."
"It's really good for its style, but not the best I had."
"Pours a clear, brownish red color with a medium off-white head that diminishes quickly. Scent is packed with dark fruits and banana. Lots of banana and a little clove. Some brown sugar as well. Taste is initially banana with figs, raisins, and some caramel malt. There are some nice chocolate and nutty flavors as well, with just the right amount of boozy flavor. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and a little syruppy. Drinkability is high. Overall, this is a tasty beer and I would definitely drink this again!"
"The beer is a dark amber/ copper color with a filmy off-white head. It smells heavily of Belgian yeast with hints of grape, cherry, clove and banana. The taste consists of raisin, Belgian yeast, clove and alcohol. The beer is medium bodied with lots of carbonation and a long finish that leaves a nice aftertaste."
"Quite a tasty brew. Keeping in trend with my Lips of Faith Belgian experiences lately, this brew as I've already mentioned is quite clean. Nothing incredibly spicy, musky or unbridled. Just forward, sweet flavors and enough of them in a solid balance to be delicious."
"Solid and somewhat complex...and also a bit different for the style, yet respectful of it at the same time. Definitely recommended."
"Mouthfeel is dry, thin, and a little flat (I think someone once told me I should use the word ""still""). Overall, this is a pretty good beer."
"On tap at the Clips of Faith event in Santa Cruz. 3 ounce sample pours dark amber with a khaki head. Bready/fruity aroma, raisins and dates with cloves, light roast, bananas. Fruitcake malt flavor, lightly acidic fruits, leather, coriander. Maybe a bit overboard with the spices. Not a fan of the finish, the roast and spice don't mix well to me. Decent enough beer though."
"O: This wasn't really a great beer with the first sip or two (didn't like it much at all, in fact). But after letting it sit for a moment, it improved significantly."
"O - Very solid, well-crafted beer. Again New Belgium comes through. Think I'm going to have to grab a couple to try down the road."
"Overall: There is a nice complexity here, which I appreciate, as it signifies the brewer's effort to make an interesting and unique beer. However, the sweetness up front and the combination of flavors are not that appealing to me overall, so I would not order this again."
"O: An interesting beer, this ""double"" Fat Tire... the unexpected clovey-ness and spice bend this one from the regular amber version to more of a Belgian (hence the style characterization of BSDA, I see)"
"Poured into a snifter this ale pours a brilliantly clear deep ruby red with a long lasting off-white head, a beautiful beer. The aroma is rather malty and loaded with yeast character. The nose brings about dark fruit, especially cherries, a bit earthy, and lots of peppery, spicy esters, quite nice. The flavor is quite malty, rather toasty, lots of caramel, and some sweetness. The malts are balanced by medium-low hop bitterness and spicy/peppery yeast character. The beer finishes with just a prick from the carbonation, a subtle warming glow in my belly, and pleasant lingering bittersweet malt presence. The carbonation is medium-high and body, smooth and medium-full. Overall this beer is wonderful. A sight to be had, with great aroma and flavor to back it up. My one mistake was picking up only one bomber. Highly recommend."
"D: Dangerously drinkable for 9.5% and overall a really great brew from New Belgium. I will definitely seek this one out when given the chance again."
"Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. A very nice Belgian-style ale that I hope to have again."
"Final thought - 9.5% ABV and $6 a pop. Try this before it is gone"
"4/4/3.5/4/3.5"
"D: A good drinkable beer and good rep for the style."
"O- this is a decent american attempt at the style, but it has nothing on the traditional belgian brewers. they need to tone down the sweetness and alcohol. maybe it would benefit from some time in the cellar."
"The beer was a reddish brown with fairly thin head. Bruised apple and cherry in the nose complemented by Belgian yeast esters. Fruity with a slightly sticky sweet, light spicy finish. An easy drinker that doesn't have the darker fruit flavors, spice and deep complexity that the better SDA's have."
"It's like what I want the original Abbey to taste like, but still not anything to supplant the better beers of the style."
"Medium-full bodied, with an initial surge of CO2 that dwindles over time. Flavorwise, it's probably one of my favorite American Dubbels (or Imperial Dubbel as we'd tend to call it), it just needs a but of airiness to bolster the carbonation and head to seem as though it was brewed at Old Belgium."
"Mouthfeel is chewy, medium bodied, spicy, smooth, and warming."
"Taste is of fruits and light chocolate like the smell promised, a little bit of heat in the middle, finishes with the copper alluded to in the appearance. I can see the similarity to the original Abbey, but this one is much bolder, almost irresponsibly so. Kind of reminds me of the Pink Panther remake, the one with Steve Martin."
"I most definitely recommend this beer. Im always very skeptical about malty belgian beers but this does not disappoint in the least bit."
"This beer pours a thin dark molasses brown in color with a heaping cream colored head. It is very clear and translucent. The beer resembles a dark iced tea after the head dissipates. It smells of banana bread, cloves, toffee, molasses, and has great breadiness. The flavors are very sweet and bready. It's like banana bread in a glass. If I didn't see what I was drinking I'd mistake it for a light, light bodied dunkelweizen. The flavors are really nice but it's a little sweet for my liking. It drinks extremely thin and you can't detect any alcohol. It's also extremely thin, especially for the style. It's a decent beer but nothing special. At $7.99 it was worth it."
"This is one of the better New Belgium beers I've had though it's crazy sweet. Still, it's a great dubbel."
"Overall: The sweetness and alcohol leave this one a slow, laborious sipper for me. A glass of water and a few necessary refills (and, later, a pat on the back for a job well done) were a must here."
"The mouthfeel is creamy, full bodied and smooth. An excellent, delicious beer to sip."
"O - Overall this was a good solid beer, but would want a little more taste profile and variation. A good Belgian and nice to have after a meal on a warmer day, but would want a little more substance."
"D - Overall, I thought this beer could stand to use a bit more flavor; I really felt that this beer was kind of all over the place; not really sure what the brewers were going for; I was shocked that this received better reviews than the Super Cru; I had both this evening and this doesn't even come close to touching the NB Super Cru"
"Malt and yeast are the stars of this brew. I get stewed red apples, funky banana yeast, syrupy bread malts, and a charming hint of booze. I'd like the mouthfeel to be a bit more viscous, but this is a great beer regardless, easily my favorite new belgium brew. Other Belgian strong ales I've had have tended to stunt my palate with their fermented booziness that is nice for the first few sips and boring for the rest. AGC is a beer that is able to balance its strengths, and is one of those rare beers where smelling and drinking it are almost equally enjoyable."
"O: On the whole, a generally well made and enjoyable beer."
"O â€“ a nice brew, nothing jumps out as unique or spectacular. Then again, there is absolutely nothing wrong with it either. I probably wonâ€™t go out of my way for it, but Iâ€™d definitely enjoy one if I happen upon it again. Only complaint, nice dry alcohol taste got a bit old toward the end of the glass."
"O- This is a good beer but isn't anything special. Ive had better offerings from New Belgium. Even though this was still a tasty brew, it didn't live up to my expectations of this particular beer, nor of the style in which it was created. For 9.5 it has quite good drinkability though."
"O: Really enjoyable beer, if you're a fan of Abbey, then by all means snag some of this while you can. Lots of enjoyable flavors that really blend nicely. It will be interesting to see how this continues to mature."
"Drink- For the style its very well done. Its soft, tasty and easy drinking"
"although i really enjoy drinking this and will have no problem doing so!....to live up to a belgian dark strong it def falls short"
"The body was crisp and clean, but thinner than I like for the style. Drinkability was good, I'd have a couple. Overall, a nice little beer that's worth trying when you see it."
"A pretty good American Belgian-style ale, lighter fruits and a decent hoppiness. Not as creamy as I would've liked, but the taste and smell are quite good."
"overall: I didn't have high expectations and this guy exceeded."
"This is good quality, but I don't think it really reflects an elaboration of the Abbey style. It's more alcoholic, but more flavors and complexity aren't really introduced as compared to the original version. Regular Abbey from New Belgium was quite good, but I don't find myself needing a more alcoholic version of it, which is essentially what this is."
"Poured amber color, with a nice white head. Smelled was intense to me, very malty, with some banana, clove and maybe raisins. Taste again was very malty, some brown sugar. Overall its a nice drink. Not anything I would go out of my way to get again, but if I saw it on a shelf I may buy it. Though, at over 9% alcohol I will need a friend to split it."
"The Grand Cru seems as if it relies more heavily on malt than the Belgian yeast it uses. Itâ€™s dark and sweet, though lacks the depth of most authentic Belgian darks. A drinkable high-ABV Belgian, but it won't change your life."
"O- Overall this beer was good. There was something about it though that didn't sit right with me to go after another pint or two if I had the option. The ABV was not really a problem although I suspect the underlying sweetness is what turned me off of other glasses of this. A nice try for New Belgium but they missed the mark just a little."
"Overall, a solid Belgian. The banana is a little strong for me. I recall this being better balanced on draught."
"Maybe not the perfect beer while out grilling chicken in this heat but it wasnt a bad choice.Poured into an Ommegang chalice a chesnut infused burgundy with a one finger slight off white head atop.Aromas of candied sugar and spicy phenols,flavors are somewhat cakey at the onset,and phenolic,but the sweetness is held at bay really well in the finish.Its a nice Grand Cru, it has all the character but its not over the top with yeasty phenols and sweetness,I will say its not overly complex for the style though."
"Lingering, boozy finish. Body is sticky and hovering in medium. Finishes less overtly sweet - the aftertaste is the fructose sweetness of banana rather than a candi sugar bomb. Balanced and interesting, but it does seem more German than Belgian.."
"it's a B+ if regular abbey is a B. let's see where the numbers land it.."
"2011 bottle. Pours medium brown, cola-like in color, with medium sized off-white head. Sexy appearance. Nose is quite enjoyable with moistened black tea leaves, dark dessert breads, and a trace of juicy fruit bubblegum (in a good way). Palate offers a mineral-like quality with toasty brown sugar sweetness, more bready qualities, and some of the black tea into the finish. Delight to drink, though my memory is more fond of the early 2000's releases."
"Overall Drinkability - Light and smooth for a Belgian strong dark ale. Doesn't offer as much complexity as others in its style, but sort of creates a style of its own. Cleaner than its brethren."
"O-Good for the price. I look forward to seeing how it ages."
"O. Overall I think this has the potential to be a better beer than it is. I really dislike the malt flavor in almost all of New Belgium's beers, and this one is no different. It does taste quite a bit like their Abbey Belgian beer. Does not resemble almost every other BSDA. Not bad. Could be better."
"Broken Wings Brewing Co is taking a break from brewing to enjoy the Lips of Faith series Abbey Grand Cru. Strong fruitiness upfront with banana, caramel, bread & mild sweet tart fruits a la cherry & strawberry. Good blend of fruits with a abv kick in this strong dark ale make this brew drinkable & quite enjoyable for all seasons."
"Drinkability: I wasn't a huge fan of some of New Belgium's earliest entries into the Belgian styles, but they keep getting more and more respectable. This beer definitely goes a long way towards furthering that cause. This is an excellent American interpretation of the Belgian Strong Dark Ale style. A good warming high ABV, sweet malts and tasty yeasts all make this a top notch beer for the style. Will definitely buy more of this to store for the fall/winter months...but it tastes just as good on a nice spring day like today."
"Overall a very solid beer and one worth seeking out if you like New Belgium's dubbel."
"O: A good but not great example of the style. Worth a try if you can find it. After standing out in the very cold rain for 8 hours today watching the boys play soccer, this is really the beer that I need to recover."
"A good drink, very easy drinking. Nice flavors."
"The brewery does a good job keeping everything consistent with this brew despite the increased ABV. Scaling up is not always easy, but GC Abbey is just every bit as amazing as their award winning staple."
"Not at all like it's predecessors... Not sure if that's a good thing. Kind of disappointing for it being NB's first release of Abbey GC in ""production"". Bummer. Maybe in the next 1000 batches they'll find they're ""old recipe"". The old recipe was almost perfect ""5" across the board... The current recipe is all over the board, needs to be honed in. Try it if you're able, a very good brew nonetheless."
"Up for review is Abbey Grand Cru. Poured cold into a small wine glass. On tap at Backcountry Pizza in Nederland, CO. Pours a nice brown with a tan head. Nose has Belgian yest and sweet malts. Not alot of complexity in the taste. Decent beer, drinks well. Go get some, try it for yourself."
"On my first trip to Denver, in October 2002, in between visiting my kids, looking for a place to live and attending GABF, I managed to find a bottle of this beer at a local shop. Poured a medium brown color, with a good off-white head. Aromas of green raisins, light brown sugar and Belgian yeast. Medium bodied and drinkable, with flavors of raisins, honey, bubble gum and spice. Very good, better than the regular version."
"D- Outstanding. This Abbey- Style Ale is a treat to the senses. As it is in limited supply, enjoy, but do not over-indulge. Allow others to imbue it treasures."
"had this in a top hat at the eastside club and we argued over the color. seeming ruby, it was then pointed out by a third that there was too much ambient red. held to a fluorescent, it was beheld a translucent penny color. now, i've had some of the more recent delicious offerings of the new belgium in the nw, but this one is special. candy sugar and malt greet the nose and as the candied cane slides down the throat, you cannot help but engage in merriness and bawdy language. sticks around with its sugary business but the alcohol slowly washes it away. had to go for a second one.. glad to see new belgium bringing their A game national. or at least to the pac-nw."
"Not a bad beer from New Belgium and a little different than what I am used to from them, hope to see it again when I am Denver in a few weeks, look forward to sampling this again, recommended"
"D: Decent, but far too phenolic for my taste."
"A very drinkable beer and though there are better examples of a Belgian style/Grand Cru, I still rate this highly..Exemplary effort for a US brewery."
"Flavor profile matches up well with the aroma, as complex layers of dark Belgian candy, wheat, pepper, toffee malt, and fruity yeast notes all combine to achieve a palate-pleasing experience. Mouthfeel is perfectly carbonated with a medium-thick body, and finishes semi-dry with a lingering fruity sweetness. Still getting the whole Weizenbock vibe from this beer, but either way, it's a damn tasty brew. Cheers to New Belgium--bottle this thing already!"
"D- Abbey Ale is one of my favorite go to brews, and if I could find this in the bottle in Chicagoland, this would fall under the same category. For its ABV, this is dangerously drinkable."
"This has a nice balance between the sweet, fruit driven notes and the spicy fermentation character, but somehow it seems to be lacking a little something to be really balanced. It is very tasty though, and I am quite pleased to finally get a chance to try this beer."
"Overall: Good beer, and I am glad to have been able to try it on tap."
"A great beer in a great beer hall."
"Drank pretty good, I probably would've bought this more as Weizenbock, but very nice none the less!"
"D - Pretty solid and easy to drink. Overall enjoyable"
"I absolutely loved this beer. I had it on tap at the flying saucer in Little Rock, AR. All I can say is wow. I could taste bourbon and the funky Belgium flavor and all I can say is wow. The beer was dark like a porter or a stout, and it was very drinkable. This is a must try beer."
"Drinkability is high, this is very tasty. Too bad they didn't make it another value offering in a 12 oz format, like their trippel and dubbel. Solid, if not spectacular, at least flawless."
"D - This is a delicious brew. I'm thrilled Sycamore has started carrying the Lips of Faith series."
"Flavor was likewise sweet and rich. Liquid caramel, candi sugar, with spicy phenolics that gave it a drying finish. Savory feel with slightly lower carbonation that was still perceptible. No hint of the alcohol, but it's definitely a slow sipper. Somewhere between dubbel and quad, entirely delicious."
"On tap at City Beer Store. Wow, this is a delicious cerveza. Malty, sweet, candi sugar, pronounced carbonation that retained some lacing throughout my enjoyment of it. Medium mouthfeel, and susceptible to being consumed in large quantities, notwithstanding the high ABV. I will be a repeat drinker of this if I see it again."
"really good beer, i can't believe that this is from the same people that make fat tire."
"By the way, this is my first beer review. i hope I did well."
"D - An excellent brew overall. I could drink 10 of these, and I would if there weren't other beers to try and a little annoyance called having to drive."
"I was told that this was the last batch that was bottle conditioned. No oxidation was apparent, and the aromatics were outstanding."
"Had on tap in Seattle. Served in a New Belgium goblet. It's a clear but deep red brew with pink tints. Has a decent white head that fades. Nose is very sweet fruits mixed with dark plums. Taste is syrupy sweet balanced with hops and a malty backbone. Great example of the style. Alcohol comes through in the finish. Mouthfeel is excellent, nice and thick and creamy. Drinkability is good but may be hurt by the ABV."
"Taste: Caramel and bourbon flavors... toffee and malty... quite sweet... a touch of licorice and smoke... dried dark fruits.... definitely pick up the cherry..."
"Bottom line: A *great* sipping Belgian Strong Ale. I'm glad I got this bottle in a trade as I tried a small sample at the brewery and I wasn't that impressed. As BA advises you, don't review a brew based on small samples and boy, is that ever true. I highly recommend this one!"
"Overall a good brew.I did like it."
"D- Very easy to drink. very good. Wish this was made regularly. Like it a lot."
"Pours a nice clear dark mahongy color, nice carbonation, nice fizzy one-finger head which leaves some nice islands and sticy lacing afterwards. The nose is of malts, yeast, plums, grapes, figs, raisins, slight caramel. The taste is very nice, sweet malty, yeasty, slight tangyness from the fruits, and a nice clean finish. Medium body, a well rounded, complex brew. Very drinkable, a very nice compliment to the style. Highly recommended."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability; mouthfeel is medium to full bodied, and with the alcohol and chalky feeling this is a little drying, but otherwise very good. Drinkabilty is good, and would be even higher with a lower abv."
"Drinkability is fine probably because this seems to be a bit under-flavored. It seems that the alcohol is diluting out the taste and the mouthfeel in this one. An OK beer but not a great one."
"The body is smooth for it's 10% build. I did sample side by side the Abbey and the Grand Cru, and I would prefer the Abbey, but its nice to see NB creating new things."
"Take a pass on this, and try one of NB's other fantastic brews."
"Wow, just noticed this beer is 10%. The alcohol is very well hidden. IMO, this could have used a bit more umph in the plums"
"Overripen fruits dominate he palate, mainly dates, figs and plums. Chocolate and caramel as well with a dry, chalky, lingering finish."
"Reddish brown mostly clear body. Light brown head displaying good belgian lacing. Very malty aroma with nutty, toffee aspects together with dark fruits (dates) and maybe some licorice. Spicy on the tongue, yeasty and bready while just being very malty and candi sugar sweet. Nice velvety mouthfeel, mostly thick with gentle carbonation. Mild alcohol warmt in the finish. This does right just about everything I expect from a dubbel which really seems to be a tough style to make a great example of."
"The beer as it debouches the 22 oz. bomber is a quite hazy mahogany color with a portly head that is spumescent in texture and a winsome light tan in color, as it evaporates, it leaves behind a fine curtain of lace to drape the glass. Nose is sweetly malt, hints of fusel alcohol, fresh and pleasing to the senses; start is ambrosial, rich in malt and the top middling to full in feel. Finish is meek in its acidity, the hops delectable in their spiciness, dry and somewhat sweet aftertaste, and a definite belly warmer, still good after 4 years, well I wonder what it will be like next year?"
"I'm not sure if this is filtered or not, but if it is, it shouldn't be. The lack of body and yeast flavors. Please bring them back."
"Thanks to Gusler for the bottle!"
"Medium copper color, large creamy head. Very rich malt taste. Very full rich flavor, expansive and fruity. Mouthfeel is very round, full and smooth. Good hop balance. Re-fermented in the bottle with Belgian yeasts, there is a near vinous like quality to this beer. Reminiscent of a Belgian Red. Very complex flavor, somewhat thick. High Alcoholl is really not that evident. Finish is very smooth. Aftertaste is malty and sweet. VERY NICE beer."
"# 3 in a tasting of 4 Cru's. But this one was the looker. A beautiful deep red color with tannish head. A very spicy aroma of dark fruits (raisins and plums) and yeast. Full body on the tongue, heavy concentrate of dark candy sugar, raisins, cherries which are still present in the long finish. Very smooth considering the heft, still highly recommended."
"Comments Â– True, this brewery has put out some duds. But, mostly, they are innovative and strive to hit the style dead on. This was a bullÂ’s eye."
"Nice rich complex flavor that's smooth on the palate"
"Pours a clear, very deep orangish-mahogany body that appears to have an almost burgundy cast in the full goblet; and displays some crimson/ruby highlights. Beautiful! Upon inspection, hundreds of tiny bubbles can be seen streaming to the surface, helping to support the short but creamy bone-white head. It holds fairly well, but eventually the circle cannot hold and it drops to a creamy collar and minor whispy surface foam. It leaves some transient spotty lace, but nothing of substance. The aroma, however, is much more noticeable and displays a softly toasted malt amidst sprinkles of peppery spice, dollops of dark fruit (prune, raisin, fig) and to a lesser degree some almost cake-like sugariness. It's firm body is rounded by the gently effervescent carbonation that caresses the tongue, and it's surprisingly smooth across the palate. The flavor is rich with maltiness that's at first lightly toasty with just a mild acidity; then soaked in ripe dark fruits; and finally followed by some peppery spice and alcohol in a long-lasting drying finish. It's really well-balanced and quite excellent! I'm immediately reminded of Chimay Premier, although this is softer; and the De Koninck Cuvee comes to mind as well. Wonderful. A real treat! The alcohol is extremely well-hidden; and it's drinkability is quite good! This is a beer that I will seek out to enjoy again and again!"
"Despite all the great characteristics to this brew, I was a little disappointed that there wasn't just a little more carbination in this one. Despite bottle fermentation, complete with a small amount of yeast particulate in the pour, it severely lacked in the spritz department. Not necessarily bad when taking the style into account, but definitely lacking all the same. It would be very interesting if they corked this one rather than capping it, and then letting it cellar for a couple of years to see the effects. It has great future potential but is still an enjoyable today just as it is."
"Reddish brown w/ a slight haze. The head settles quickly into a thin layer that leaves a respectable lace. Assertive bubblegum ester in aroma like New Belgium's normal strength dubbel.  In this kicked up brew the bubblegum ester isn't overbearing & is accompanied by toffee, a bit of banana, raisiny Special B notes and phenol; heaty fusels are there as well if you inhale deeply.  Quite complex in aroma-- I'm reminded of an overly phenolic & caramelly Dunkelweiss. The initial flavor is of sugary sweetness, but heavily caramelized sugar flavors from the Special B & dark candi sugar follow along w/ subtle chocolate notes.  The hop bitterness is virtually nonexistant & lends a syrupy sweet but smooth quality to this brew.  Banana flavors from the yeast persist from start to finish. Finishes sweet, caramelly, & with mild alcohol warmth. This brew could age for a while & will gain complexity through time.  This would be great with a rich banana split topped with chocolate syrup."
