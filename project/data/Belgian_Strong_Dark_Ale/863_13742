Served fresh at the wonderful Russian River Brewery pub, only one word for this, if you understand Belgian Style Dark ale, excellent. Perfectly balanced, subtle but substantial. Sweetness controlled by excellent malts and the background caramel simply teases the taste buds for a smooth finish that lingers on a tantalizing thread of wonderful elegance. Word association: chocolate, molasses, cherry, black grape. One review of this Salvation said this is not an everyday beer, it's a very substantial 9% ABV, lets hope it doesn't get to be too everyday. It is a sip and enjoy a beautifully crafted jewel from RR Brewing Co.","JimTeal","Apr 13, 2013"

The malt is s bit heavy on the dark barley malt which has plenty of roast and slight chocolate flavors. Smooth in body with the alcohol well hidden into the finish of this brew. A nice beer. Better than many of RR other ventures into the world of yeasty Belgian beers this beer has some character and decently complex flavors.","deebo","Feb 16, 2013"

Very very creamy kahki colored head. Aroma of raisins, cherries, and possibly a hint of smoke. Belgian yeast comes through and this gives of fruit qualities of a dubbel or quad. Some prickle up front from the carbonation and spice as a blast of fruit heads down your throat. Plums and berries all over. Very smooth. Finishes with a burst of unexpected chocolate and a lingering nuttiness. Chocolate really starts coming out with some more sips. Pretty thick mouthfeel, bigger than a porter but less than an impy.

4,-2.2,4,4,4,4,4,"375ml bottle courtesy of Callmecoon. Batch 010 served in my DT tulip. Pours a dull mahogany hue with a hazy clarity and a dense, 2.5 inch, tan-colored head. Head eventually settles into a sold, half inch cap with textured clusters of lacing revealed during the tasting. Nose expresses dark fruit, tannins, spice, candi sugar and toffee notes. There's also a trace of ethanol towards the back. Taste consistent with nose; however, there's also a bready quality. Dark fruit character (plums, figs, prunes) is more consistent with the skin than the meat and is interlaced with a considerable malty presence. Ethanol present in the nose is also manifested in the flavor profile. Mouthfeel is medium-ight in body with an assertive, almost prickly carbonation. There's also a bit of acidity to this beer. Overall, a solid offering from this brewer, but not my favorite. I would, however, like to see how this beer develops with some cellaring.","Jwale73","May 30, 2012"

Aroma of dark fruit, malt and a bit of spice. Flavor of malt, dark fruit, somewhat subdued. Finish is a bit dry and spicy with no distinct spices. Thick and creamy. An interesting, if understated ale. Flavor progression somewhat abrupt from dark fruit, malt to dry spice.

Served from bottle into a Russian River -tion Chalice (how appropriate). Poured a deep red brown with a two finger cream colored headed that subsided to one finger slowly. Maintained phenomenal lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, spices, dark fruit, and dark chocolate. The flavor was of sweet malt, wood, spices, dark fruit, and dark chocolate. It had a medium feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this wasn't a bad brew at all. If I'm honest my palate went into shock on the first sip as it was a little harsh. It started to 'adjust' after about three sips and the beer became much more palateable. This one was quite complex and everything blended quite well together. The spices were definitely present and reminded me of a Saison only not as harsh. But the dark fruit and dark chocolate helped to tone the spices down quite a bit leaving a nice sweet/bitter combo going on. Definitely worth trying if you get the chance.","thagr81us","Jun 26, 2011"

There's a voluminous, dirty ivory foam crown topping the beer. It gets up to about 4 fingers in height before very slowly creeping down the glass. Lacing is very spotty though. The nose is pungent as all hell, and is everything I'd want in a BSDA. The dark fruitiness is what shows up first, figs and plums and a little bit of bruised banana abound. A solid clove spiciness comes in to act as a counterpart, and I can't imagine a better balance between the two. The flavor brings more of the same, though everything doesn't quite pop as much as in the aroma. The body is picture perfect, remarkably creamy for what really is a dry beer. The carbonation isn't quite expansive and active enough to match with the best Belgian style brews though. Despite one or two minor missteps, Salvation is one of the absolute best dubbels/BSDAs/quads I've ever had. I was quite shocked to see it's 9%ABV, as it drinks a bit smoother than that.

Yep, this is damn good, and about as close as one can get to the true examples (St Bernie Abt, Rochie 10, etc).

Roasted malts in the mouth with nice carbonation and a hoppy bitterness and a touch of spice - the initial nosing is really the star here.

Unlike some of my colleagues, I thought this beer almost smelled like nothing. The little bit I picked up was Belgian yeast and minimal hop or other source bitterness. Not only was the nose a let down, but it gave me no idea what was to come. A touch of candied sugar accompanies that Belgian yeast flavor with a grainy dryness. I wasn't a fan of the first sip, but this beer grew on me a bit as I made my way through it. It went down fairly easy and had a decent mouthfeel, which I won't overly comment on having limited experience with the style. To me, this was an interesting beer that lacked something. As a relatively high ABV brew, I was expecting a bit more flavor or nuance. I didn't really feel there was enough of either.","seeswo","Jan 20, 2011"

The taste was very similar to the nose with big belgian yeast character but had nice spice, slight cocoa, caramel, and toffee accents. There was some dark fruit flavors but it also had some boozy undertones on the tail end. The brew was medium body with a moderate amount of carbonation which had a slight toasty but sweet finish.

Loads of caramel and cocoa dominate, a hint of dark fruits in there, roast, coffee, toffee, a light spiciness. A pleasing bitterness and dryness still in the finish, not dominating but enough to tweak the sweetness of this brew - perhaps if anything I would go a little dryer/bitter to counter the sweetness. Thought the mouthfeel could also be a little more robust but in all honesty these are minor quibbles - this was one of the smoothest brews I've had in a while; simply top notch.","ritzkiss","Jul 17, 2010"

Banana and spice again, with toasted bread and yeast. Caramel and brown sugar interplay nicely and never become too much. A solid mouthfeel with ample carbonation. Light spice and a touch of tartness, it's very smooth with a light tickle on the tongue. This is quite easy going down as well.

On the end you get an almost bitter edge which seems odd to me off this style. Feel is decent. Not a ton of carbonation and bubble over your tongue, but it is thick with character from ingredients. It is drinkable, yes. In a blind taste test, I doubt anyone would be able to tell that this one came from the U.S. (and not Belgium). However, I feel as if it lacks a level of maturity and oomph that would ever send me back to drinking it again.

4.35,6.4,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Batch #004. Poured from a 750 ml bottle into my DT snifter. It was a dark rich mahogany color. It had a small light tan head that quickly settled into a thin collar. The aroma was sweet with fruit and a spicy undertone. Could also sense a bit of the alcohol. Unlike most BSDA's that I've had this year, this one didn't have an over-reliance on dark fruit (raisins mainly) and alcohol. Most BSDA aromas bug me with those but this one was very enjoyable. The same went for the taste. It had a much richer flavor for me than the others which I found too raisiny and hot. It has a sweet taste that stays well short of cloying. The aftertaste builds on the sweetness in a good way. Gotta say this is one of maybe 2 BSDA's that I'd look forward to drinking again right now. Highly recommend. It's not available here or it'd be a several time a year player. For now, I'll have to rely on my best friend's brother to ship us some a couple times a year.

Flavor settles nicely after a while and becomes a nice complex Belgian. creamy and puffy mouthfeel. full bodied. Overall, too much for me, especially for the first glass or so.

Beautiful aromas coming out of the chalice, including plums, sweet and sour fruit, some cinnamony esters, and a pronounced sourness reminiscent of a flanders red- this scent does not come through in the flavor. The flavor itself is wonderful, however. Very creamy, with a taste as of plum and cherries marinated in balsamic vinegar, water, and honey. Rich darker fruit follows with some immediate bitterness and then a long creamy sweet finish that is divine. Really a work of art and a little more fully integrated and creamy after some extra time in the bottle. The sourness seems a little more interesting as well. The mouthfeelis phenomenal- light and airy, it seems to float on the palate, and with a wonderful creaminess.

Flavor is a quite sour malty flavor, with some cherry. thai lemongrass and galangal, but its not particularly nuanced or distinctive. Composed with some long caramels and a bit of sour oat saltiness. Ebbs lemon tangy on the backend and this joins some bland grape skins. Bite of almond. Not cloying. Yeast begins to dominate.

Aromas of cloves, bananas, spiced prunes and only the faintest whiff of yeast. The aroma is much brighter and cleaner than batch 001. Strong clove flavors are complimented by a lush, slick sweet yeastiness. Some banana tones are present, and the finish is much warmer and wet than batch 001, and is also a touch sticky. Longish finish punctuated by clove oil, pepper, and dark fruits. Medium-full body and fine carbonation, this felt bigger than 001.

Tons of yeasty bread, dark berry fruit in the from of black cherry and black berry tumbles from the glass. Figs, dates, all of the dark caramel essence you would expect from a fine Belgian style ale. The flavor reflects the aroma quite well. The dark berry character comes up front. The black cherry is very prominent. Nice fig element mid drink with just a touch of orange citrus on the finish.

Certainly banana & spice in the aroma as advertised. Also some background hints of caramel malty sweetness & really ripe peach. Moderate quantity of caramel malt provides a foundation for the yeastiness to shine. Deep & dark fruit flavors seem to come & go as a subtle bitterness & almost clove-like spiciness make brief appearances. Ripe banana and sweetened raisins in the finish.
