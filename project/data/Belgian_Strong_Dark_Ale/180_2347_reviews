"Bottle was aged 3 years, buttload of sediment but very tasty when aged"
"Dried fruit aromas, dark pitted fruits, spice, dark sugars and a suspicion of fruitcake, traces of alcohol and some earthiness on the nose. Pours brilliant chestnut under a 1” white foam cap that slowly dissipates to a thin whisp of a head that never the less produces lace. Also has some legs. Fruit cake components start the palate with fig to dates, a hint of toffee, prune, dark cake, a little spice (coriander and anise) alcohol and an earthy hop finish. There is also some warming but the alcohol is not solventy or hot. It is surprisingly light for all it has going on and the alcohol levels – medium to medium high on the body and medium carbonation. A big beer with the presence of a port or a bourbon."

"I'm not impressed with these Belgian golden strong ales.  The taste is basic pilsner like with some spice & metallic?  A+ All the way for the bottle though, its one of the few that I keep around."
""
""
"Very drinkable with a nice aroma and good head.  Like all Delerium bottles... expensive and for the $$$ you can find better value."
"Strange metallic after taste bit over vs carbonated"

"Overall:  This is another goddamn excellent Belgian Christmas beer!!  I love the strong Belgian yeast flavors as well as the strong citrus notes.  Absolutely delicious!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Aroma of caramel malt, spices, Belgian yeast, dark fruit, candidate sugar. Taste sweet dark fruit, malt, yeast, brown sugar, spice."
"Good color, decent head that lasts awhile.  Pleasant taste, but doesn't stand out.  Drinkable.  Nice label."
""
""
""
"Wanted it to be good but just want happening"
""
""
"Not the most mind bending brew, but a great take on Delirium with a real neat taste."
""
"Overall - While the Belgian yeast really dominates, it doesn't have some nice flavors that manage to shine through."
"Interesting and complex taste, great after bite, good head."
"There are not many bad things to say about this brew. It hit the spot on a bitterly cold night. We could sit here all night and talk about everything this beer is not like, but that’s a waste of a good night."
"Mouthfeel: Well hidden alcohol, and very drinkable."

"Good beer for the holidays"
""
""
"33 cl. bottle. Big head that fades soon, leaving a tiny disperse lace. Smell of spices, cinnamon, candied fruits, brown sugar.  Light body, sticky palate, normal carbonation.  Taste of spices, caramel, dark fruits. Not the best of the Deliriums, IMO."
""
""
"3.33/5: The Noel is a bit weak, but the Delirium is really nice"
""
"Worth a try.. A very well made beer! 10% abv I detected no alcohol. Good Belgian ale"
"Overall, the beer is a bit of a let down, especially if you were expecting a complex Christmas ale or something similar to Delerium Tremens.  Still it is a decent Christmas ale."
"I think this thing foamed more than anything I have ever had. Decently good strong ale though."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall I like the original better but still pretty good"
""
""
"Cool bottle. Complex taste but not that smooth. Overall not worth the cost"

"O:  Many have said this is the best of the Deliriums and I'm not disappointed.  A great sipper with friends.  Toast the season with this little elephant."
""
"O: This is a big beer and one that I prefer to sip slowly when I enjoy it - there is a moderate amount of complexity and the beer is not too sweet making it pretty easy to drink. Definitely one I look forward to during the holiday season. Complexity increases as the beer warms up."
""
"Overall = 3.5 / 5"
""
""
""
"Huge pear and dark Belgian sugar yumminess, with caramel and melanoidin notes. Flavor is more green apple, with rummy dates, figs, and brown sugar notes. Very rich and delicious."

"This is a big, assertive beer that's perfect for cold nights. One of my all time favorite beers."

"O – Excellent balance and a complex aroma and flavor profile, washed mostly away by the millions of scrubbing bubbles. Would love this with some roasted, garlicky meats, or crispy potatoes."

"Overall – Pretty tasty stuff.  A nice amount of juicy dark fruit flavour and the ABV is well hidden.  Not a whole lot of a christmas flavour going on though, which is maybe a good thing."

"750 ml bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 5/6/2013. Pours light hazy deep ruby red color with a 2 finger light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big raisin, plum, fig, pear, apple, apricot, banana, caramel, brown sugar, toast, bread, clove, herbal, light nuttiness, and yeast earthiness. Fantastic aromas with great complexity of fruity/earthy yeast and dark/bready malt notes; with great strength. Taste of big raisin, plum, fig, pear, apple, apricot, banana, caramel, toast, brown sugar, bread, clove, herbal, light nuttiness, and yeast earthiness. Fair amount of earthy yeast spice on the finish; with lingering notes of raisin, plum, fig, pear, apple, apricot, banana, caramel, brown sugar, toast, bread, clove, herbal, light nuttiness, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a while. Damn nice complexity and robustness of fruity/earthy yeast and dark/bready malt sweetness; with a great malt/yeast flavor balance and zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a smooth and fairly slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is an awesome Belgian strong dark ale. All around great complexity and balance of fruity/earthy yeast and dark/bready malt sweetness; and very smooth to sip on for the big ABV. A highly enjoyable offering."

"O: I make sure to grab as many as I can every winter. It's a great beer for the season without being too ""seasonal"" (i.e. fruity/fake-tasting). If you're a fan of the style at all, it's a must-buy. Absolutely delicious, warming, and in ways comforting."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Taste is heavy on the fruity qualities, with a sweet character (witness the berries mentioned before) and a slightly spiced, warming finish. I get plenty of carbonation here (indeed, the caged & corked bottle popped loudly upon opening). This is a beautiful brew, packed with complexity and well worth a try for anyone into classic Belgian ales."

"A very decent christmas beer, but I will stick to others instead."

"World class brew from a world class brewer, got a couple of these in the cellar. Apparently these are peaking in 2 years, like a lot of offerings from the brouwerij huyghe"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Fairly typical of the Belgian Christmas ales I've tried, with perhaps a bit less orange flavor. Spicy, festive, could be smoother. Recommended."

"Presentation: Packaged in a one liter brown glass bomber coated in white enamel and sealed with a cork and cage. Bottled in March of 2010."
""
""
""
"The nose was very nice on this but the flavor had some odd stuff going on. Lots of oxidation and the alcohol paired with the herbal notes was not what I would call tasty. This is a one and done for me."
"O) A strong dose of alcohol in this mildly spicy winter warmer"
""
""
"Pours a beautiful deep red that forms a gigantic lasting head with excellent lacing. Smells of red fruit, plums especially on the nose with a strong malt back bone. Slight souring on the palate possible flaw. Caramel notes with some nice malt on the palate. Small crisp bubbles with a fairly light body."

"Not nearly as good as the two other Delirium beers I've had. Not a bad beer, just a bit disappointing based on what I was hoping for. For what it's worth, it comes in a cool bottle."

"Pours medium amber with a red hue. Massive thick off white head that lingers with superior lacing. Light nose of dark malt sweetness, Belgian yeast and alcohol against a backbone of dark fruit. Light medium body that matches well with the somewhat high carbonation level. The taste is pleasant with notes of spice against an alcohol base. It finishes with a note of spice and alcohol. The alcohol leaves that nice pleasant burn. More spice or lower alcohol would improve the balance and make this outstanding."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"notes: a remarkable, tasty, complex sipper that is like a cross between a Dubbel and a Tripel."
"O: Did very well in all areas except taste which wasn’t bad without exceling, pretty good but could have grabbed more attention."
""

"Better than Tremens."

"Overall, a decent Belgian, but overly sweet and not too complex."
""
""
""
"33 cl. bottle @ ‘t Waagstuk – the only Delirium beer I hadn’t tried yet, always passing it over in favour of better options – colour is an incredibly bright ruby amber with a grey white head, volatile herbs, dissolvent, windex, churned cough syrup, rotting malts, plastic fruits, revolting Belgian yeast, this is artificial & downright gross and nasty. Awful stuff which is not particularly surprising given the fact that Huyge made this."

"Overall, this is excellent ale, bringing a full complement of fruits and sugars to the table, with an excellent balance of spices and very light dark breads to keep it from becoming cloying."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Solid carbonation still left on this one. More more focus on red fruits, but still plenty of the spicy profile. Mellowing it out does good to this."
""
""
"Overall, this is a good version of the style, but I prefer Delirium Tremens."
""
""
""

""
""
""
""
""

"Overall: probably would get again next year if I saw it on the shelf while shopping but not somthing I will seek out and would probably skip over in preference of other holiday beers. It will definetly get you feeling good at 10 abv."
""
""
""
""
""

""

"This pours a medium brown color with little floaties in it along with a creamy light brown head. The scent is sweet, malty, mixed with spices. The taste is smooth, flavorful, and delicious. The flavor is full of yeasty malt flavors that make for a well carbonated brew that leaves a good, lingering after taste."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Not the best Dilerium beer but definately a good Belgian example."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - a sweet winter warmer. Does get sweeter as the bottle goes on but lots of complexity to this one."

"Not bad, solid belgian ale with some great flavors. I still prefer Delrium Tremens to this though."
""
""
""
""
"Poured into a Delirium Tremens glass. Pours a clear amber color with a large, lasting, frothy, creamy, beige head. Very pretty. Smell is tart cherries and yeasty funk. Nice smell. Head won't dissipate! Waiting...waiting...*Final Jeopardy tune ensues*...waiting. OK. Let's do this. Taste is leathery and doesn't really follow the tart aroma. Sort of bland and a lot less flavor than expected. Bit of fruit. Slight booze and breadiness. I just haven't been impressed with the Delirium line. Expensive, bland, and an ugly bottle to boot. Sad face, as I was excited to try it :-("

""
""
""
""
""
""
""

""
""
""
""
""

"Pours a golden to amber - depending on the light. Good head at pour reduces down to a thin head just on top with a trace of lacing present. Smell is somewhere between a strong Belgian ale and a hint of sour. Taste is more Belgian ale up front but then fruit - fig, plum, prune - and Christmas spices take over on the back end. This beer should be drank on the colder side - too much sitting brought out less desirable flavors."
""
""
"Overall: This is definitely a beer for the cold months. It warms you up when you drink it. The spices are a bit too strong and this makes the brew a bit messy and unbalanced. That being said, it's still very good, but not the best in the Delirium lineup."
""
""
""
""
"I loved it."
""
"Overall a rather enjoyable beer. It is somewhat sweet in the finish and no hops make an appearance. It is big and warming and a wonderful winter treat."
""
"Enjoyed this one while jazz club hopping in New Orleans! Served from tap into a Chimay goblet. Poured red-brown with a half finger off-white head that subsided to a minimal amount quickly. Maintained nice lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, bread, spice, fruit, dark fruit, and subtle sweet alcohol. The flavor was of sweet malt, fruit, banana, spice, grain, earth, dark fruit, and subtle sweet alcohol. It had a light feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a good brew. I really like the aspect of the sweet alcohol taking place here to let you know that even though this brew has pink elephants on it, it still has a set of balls! There was also a very nice spice aspect going on in the flavor which kept your palate interested in what you would find next in it. Really glad I got the chance to try this one on tap and was really surprised I found this at a jazz bar of all places. Definitely worth trying if you get the opportunity."
""
""
"O- I enjoyed this beer much more than the Delirium Tremens. Tasty, but not something I'd like to drink a lot of."
""
""
"The beer is not a bad brew but I have had better strong dark ales. That being said, I think that it is worth having at least once but I probably will not be picking this brew back up again next year."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Lighter bodied and more drinkable than expected. I thought it would be darker in color and much more spiced. I like the flavor a lot, definitely a good noel and will buy again. Strange how drinkable it is, i'm enjoying this. I can seriously drink this all day..."
""
"Overall: probably would get again next year if I saw it on the shelf while shopping but not somthing I will seek out and would probably skip over in preference of other holiday beers. It will definetly get you feeling good at 10 abv."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall it is solid Noel Beer. It's higher alcohol content will definitely keep you warm on those cold, wet winter nights."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: represents Christmas flavors work and could pare well any Christmas meal. That isn't it this is a really solid beer on its own with great taste and mouthfeel I will be back next Christmas season"
""
""
""
""
""
"A really enjoyable holiday strong ale. Nice all-around balance of flavors and alcohol and nice enjoying with holiday company gathered around a wood fire..."
""
""
""
""
"O: Overall it is a really good Belgian Strong. It is heavy on fruit character and less on caramel sweetness. If you don't mind really strong Belgian flavor then I would recommend the beer. It is not for a person who wants a more mild tasting Belgian. Personally I enjoyed the beer."

""
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Eerily drinkable, delightfully effervescent, there is no hyperbole great enough to even take a shot at this titan of a fermented beverage review. Legitimately one of the great ones."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Not something I would drink everyday, but overall a decent beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- A quite tasty and enjoyable Belgian strong. It has a somewhat complex but very enjoyable taste with a feel that complements the flavors and alcohol nicely."
"This is dangerously drinkable; I'm not sure if it's a good or bad thing that I bought the 11.2oz bottle. I'll probably have to give this another shake sooner than later."

""
"O- I love delirium noctrum.. and this almost reminds me of it but on a Xmas front... but it just falls short for me and I'd take noctrum any day over this."
""
"O - Always satisfying and smooth. Hardly any alcohol taste (until you're done)."
"Overall, a decent brew, but the weakest of the Delirium bunch. Tasty, but I would probably pass this one up in the store next time, for either a better Belgian style or a different holiday seasonal offering."
""
"chalking this up to maybe a bad batch or bottle. ive drank worse... i think"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"There's a brandy sweetness to the beer that reminds me of raspberries and apricots. Lightly sour in the swallow. The alcohol is quite prominent in the swallow. The aftertaste is short lived. Full bodied with a respectable level of carbonation. There's a touch of spice (all spice?, white pepper)"
"O: Overall, this was somewhat of a disappointment, for 2 reasons. One, I LOVE the regular Delirium Tremens, so I had high hopes for this. And two, I recently had St. Bernardus Christmas Ale which is a BSDA that just blew this one out of the water. There is a lot going on here, but for me the characteristics just dont blend very well. Not bad, but I certainly wont have more than one in the holiday season. Maybe Ill have another next year though."
"O: A solid holiday-styled BSDA with nice complexity and good fruit and spice character. The alcohol is well hidden and accentuates the flavors nicely. A solid holiday sipper"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a clear orange-brown with a foamy khaki head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Foamy swaths of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, brown sugar, fruits, spices, and a slightly tart aroma. Taste is much the same with a mild spice bitterness with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer but the tartness is unexpected even though it works out with the aromas and flavors."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Carbonation is ridiculously high."
"Body is of medium heft, with fairly prickly carbonation, which is somewhat surprising given the minimal amount of visible carbonation. Resulting beer is at first sharp, then creamy due to the foaming characteristics from the carbonation."
"A very nice Christmas beer to slowly sip by the fire with some snacks. My major complaint is the booziness, although at 10% it is quite mild. Dark and fruity, a Belgian through and through."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Certainly a treat, fruity, drinkable, great aroma, and nice to behold, I'll have to age another a bit longer and compare"
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Buy it, age it, then drink t. This is a pretty damn good beer if you ask me, I am not saying this because of any bias I am saying this because it is that appetizing. Salud!"
"Quite a tasty treat to help celebrate kicking Winter in the nads and saying hello to Spring!!"
"O: Drinks very easy and has a solid flavor profile. Nose is a little weak and it could use a bit more complexity but it's a well done beer."

"Overall: Not bad, but not excellent. The body is cool, does that count for anything?"

"Delirium Noel lacks the “wow” factor and special character of other Christmas beers. However, it is a good sipping beer to enjoy while reading or listening to music."
""
"Overall a decent brew, and worthy of drinking again next winter."
""
""
"Overall it's good. It's not a home run for me, and in comparison to the Tremens, this one is not quite there. Worth a try, not worth searching the globe to find."
""
""
""
""
"O: This is a great looking beer. It also has a very nice sour fruity aroma that reminds one of a lambic or red ale rather than a noel. The fruity flavors are right upfront, and the creamy mouthfeel is nice (though it could be heavier). The finish is almost metallic, too sour, and the alcohol is too present. The beer could be balanced a bit better."
""
"O: Good overall"
""
""
""
""
""
"Glad it wasn't a huge glass I had: this beer has more hype than substance."
"Overall- The drink gets a little too spicy and warm on the palate compared to the nose. The soft and sweet profiles recognized on the nose would have served this beer better."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Though, i prefer the tremens and nocturnum. But deffinatley worth trying."
"O-well hidden alcohol for 10% the metallic start to the taste was a little disappointing other than that it was enjoyable"

"O: decent but not something I will rely on."
""
"O: A little over spiced for my tastes. Solid malt tones of bread and molasses underneath. Decent, but nothing that I'll search out again."
""
"The biggest problem this beer has is the smell, much too smokey. The fluid is amber coloured. Taste is very weird, i had some problems with this taste. To be honest i had much better Christmas brews!"
""
""
""
""
"Overal a nice beer, nothing wrong with it, not too special and very sweet."
""
""
"Drinkability: A very solid and enjoyable brew; perfect to enjoy with a nice holiday in the winter. Nothing too complex but this isn't a brew that leaves for any type of desire except for more."
"O- Drinkable beer, but not as robust as I'd imagined. That's not a slight, I just don't think I've tried enough Belgian strong / holiday ales to have informed expectations. Would buy again if it were convenient and reasonably priced."
""
""
""
""
"Overall a good beer for a cold winter night."
"O - Not a bad beer, but there are just too many other Belgian Dark Strong Ales (like their own Nocturnum) to get this again."
"Notes: I really do fear these brews keep on riding on some sort of iconic popularity, specially among the non-aficionados… And sure enough, they are quality and fair, but nothing remarkable, and surely not of my particular liking."
""
"It's probably worth noting that this beer ages pretty well, too. I got a chance to try one that had been aging for 3 years at a Christmas tasting last year and it had developed a lot more dried fruit and caramel notes, too. If you can hang on to it - give it a try."
""
""
""
"O – Very nice brew that just feels like Christmas. Perfect sipping with the cold weather. Tasty and warming."
""
"Aside from its redness, this is not christmas, rather a pleasant, strong and almost devilish experience."
""
""
"This is a great beer. I recommend picking up a bottle before the season is out. This brewery is amazing. Another great example from Belgium."
""
"OVerall, my least favorite of the delirium i've had, but certainly went well with a meal."
"D - Both an outstanding season offering and an outstanding Belgian Strong Dark Ale... While the bottle and dancing elephant is a nice gimmick, more importantly it has come to symbolize quality and outstanding craftsmanship... Excellent beer..."
"This is one of my favorite Christmas Belgian ales - not too sweet, not to bitter, nothing is off-putting. I think I'll have another one of these tomorrow."

"A lovely, complicated, but remarkably easy to put back (not that I did) strong Belgian ale - and the plucky dryness sure helps when sided with yet more of my Mom's good ol' Christmas baked confections."
""
"Overall this is a solid dark pale ale, just really well put together."
""
"Half finger head with a lot of lace. Clear and crimson with amber hues. Aroma is almost like a wild ale, sour dark fruit , mostly cherry. Taste is very different however. Not a typical Belgian dark strong flavor but close. Initially a little bland and malty but finished with a nice but mild slightly sour dark fruit and fig flavor. Medium body and moderate to high carbonation. Overall a good beer, fairly drinkable for the genre but not the best I have had."
"Overall: A wonderful Christmas experience, recommend holding on to a bottle or two for Christmas Future, just watch the second pour."
"Overall I would say it is worth the $12 I paid for it simply because it was 10% and a 750ml, but on flavor alone I'd say it is a one time buy."
""
""
"O: Overall a great beer love it."
"There is an underlying slick feeling, almost like orange oil. That orange feeling lies underneath (Curacao oranges are nice) all the yeast and makes the beer nice and complex."

"I was able to try a glass (tulip) of Delirium Noel at the Kendall Pub in Yorkville, IL. The beer has a nice deep amber color with a decent off white creamy one finger head. Their is a nice lacing around the top of the glass and it is well carbonated. The smell comes off malty, a sweet fruity smell (almost dried fruit) and a hint of carmel to it. The taste has a lot going on with just a great blend of sweetness, carmel, fruity, and a nice malty finish..it just comes together well. The mouthfeel is decent as it lingers with some bitterness from the malts and almost a little piney taste that hangs around. Overall, this is a decent beer and im curious of buying a bomber and keeping it cellared for a couple of years to see if it gets more complex. A decent xmas beer."
"The smell is a strong malt-forward fruitiness with light phenols and a touch of a vinegar-like astringency. The taste is nice, primarily that malt fruitiness and some spices. I have a hard time with such a gassy beer. I think they need to drop some of that carbonation. Worth a try, but I won't be picking this up again next year."
""
"Enjoyable overall but not really worth seeking out every year. Take away the metallic taste and boost the malt profile a bit, and I think I would like this brew a bit more."

"From a caged, corked 25 ouncer from the 2011 batch. Sampled on December 20, 2011. The top was also covered with tin foil glued on so it was a bit of a task to open the darn thing. Eventually it poured an attractive dark amber sort of like mahogany with a short-lived head that leaves little in the way of lacing. This is most definitely an aromatic beer with a variety of sweet malts, apple, yeast, and some alcohol in the character. The body runs in the medium range. The taste starts out with sweet, oily malts followed by a notable, dry hop afterbite. The 10% ABV comes on strong and I feel it pretty quickly but that is what Belgian Strong Ales are supposed to do. This will warm you up on a cold winter night."

"pours christmas approproate dark red with a nice belgian tan head. smells yeasty, sweet, and moderately spiced, which is exactly how it tastes too. the yeast makes this beer for me, bright and doughy at the same time, creating a really lively mouthfeel and a great aroma. taste is lacking something for me though, especially for a ten dollar beer, it seems so generic in a way, which is hard to imagine from this brewer. its of course a well made belgian, so it will score well, but it just didnt wow me like i hoped it would. way better and more affordable seasonals out there to be enjoyed"
"It's a holiday favorite, what can I say? Slightly overrated, but a must have every Christmas season."
""
""
"Aroma is your prototypicial malts yeast and candied sugar. Sweet and malty tasting some yeast and brown sugar. Has a alcohol induced harshness when swallowed. The ABV is a bit high for me but it does drink fairly well."
""
""
""
"O- a good strong ale very crisp and sweet alcohol is present, a good one to have on tap"
"The body is full, but just shy of cloying. The spritzy effervescence fades fast."
"OK, NOT MUST TRY!"
""
"o: as much as i liked it, after this four pack is gone, i just dont know if i would purchase it again."
""
""
"Edit: It mellows out a ton while you're in the process of drinking the bottle. Maybe that's why I loved it before - definitely recommended."

"Overall - This is probably the first dark beer I've had that DIDN'T make me gag haha. But it's still not my style.. but I won't knock it"
""
"...this a quality brew deseves a quality pairing iwth only the best. I recommend a milky buttery oyster stew with oyster crackers while chillin' to the noises of beautiful Christmas music from the amazing and icononic guitarist John Fahey!!"
"Two fingers off white head, small bubbles, medium dissipation with significant lacing over dark brown opaque body, no visible carbonation even when held up to light, a really dark beer. Light golden raisins in the nose, some plums, a bit of earthy hops for presence. Taste mirrors the nose, though the hops are a bit more floral on the tastebuds, a bit of light spice presence, cinnamon. Mouthfeel is well on the full side of medium, good effervescence, a slight bit sticky. A nice Belgian Holiday Ale, though I'm guessing this taste a bit better in the big bottle where the bottle conditioning is more effective."
"I would never turn one down."
""
""
"But take note: I found little balance with this beer. It was a strong, funky party in my mouth. I still don't know if I like it, but I appreciate what the brewers have done here."
""
"This beer has earned its status as a Delirium and is a beer I would enjoy on any occasion. I would especially recommend this to anyone who appreciates Delirium's other offerings."
""
"I admit that I don't have the largest knowledge on seasonal spiced brews, as I'm not a huge fan, but most that I've tried in Europe have been very enjoyable so far. This IS a good beer, mind you (although I prefer their flagship beers way more) but it does at times resemble a dubbel gone kind of haywire. The spices don't excite me as much as they should, but the malts and yeast taste great. Worth a try but would recommend starting with Delirium Tremens or Nocturnum before this one."
""
""
""
""
"The feel of this beer is so smooth it feels like silk on the tongue and goes down so easy that it is barely putting any kind of aftertaste in the back of the throat."
""
"O: A good beer. Not quite as good as Tremens, but tasty."
""
""

"Overall, a great Belgian, with a nice holiday warmth."
"Poured this slowly to not disturb the yeast. Pours a pretty clear ruby red color that left a one finger head that sizzled away like soda. Aroma smells surprisingly like a hefe. I'm getting banana and clove up front. I also smell some vanilla. Smells inviting. Drinks just like the smell. Banana and clove dominate. I'm also getting hints of some dark fruits: maybe plums or raisins. Mouthfeel is unexpectedly thin and watery. The alcohol is very well hidden. Overall, pretty tasty. This is a relatively sweet brew, but not cloying. I would have liked to see a fuller body and some more complexity. This is a good beer, but not an ideal candidate for a cold winter night as other Christmas ales tend to be. Probably not worth the price tag, but definitely worth trying."
""
"This beer has some potential, but it isn't spectacular. However, it's quite pleasing in general and the bottle is awesome. I'll try the other Delirium beers, but I won't be dying to do so."

"Drank this with Thanksgiving dinner. Looks great in the glass. Smells vinous and malty. Taste is vinous with some darker fruit. Soft mouthfeel and gentle on the palate with barely noticeable alcohol. Really good stuff and the perfect accompaniment to a rich holiday meal."
""
"O: Not one of the best Belgians on the shelf, but a welcome distraction. Enjoyable."
"Not especially intense or flavorful compared to the best examples of the style, but it makes for a very pleasing winter warmer none the less."

"O - overall, a disapointment. I had high hopes but this beer just didn't work for me as much as I wanted it to. This is my first sampling from this brewery - hopefully the other hold up a bit better. I will avoid this in the future."
"Drinkability/overall- i would say for the most part this beer was a little to simple, while it wasnt bad it just lacked that little something extra to make it great, not as good probably as there two regular offerings, certainly quite easy get down and the booze quite hidden but id say a bit lack luster"
""
""
"O: The smell is better than the taste, and on top of that the taste isn't all that exciting, so I'll stick to the usual nocturnum or tremens."

"Pours a brown color w/ a two finger cocoa head. Big time pop from the cork, and massive carbonation ensues. Not much lacing here though, it just doesn't stick to the sides of my snifter. Smell is peaches, apricot, fig, date, yeast and malt. Very nicely blended together without being too sweet. The 10% ABV is absent. Taste is right along the same profile w/ a medium alcohol burn on the aftertaste. Feel is malty/nutty silkiness w/ a carbonated bite on the back end. This is a totally solid brew- not my favorite x-mas style ale, but it's one I'd definitely pick up again. Cheers."

"O: Very delightful. Strong but light enough you aren't weighed down. Good for any winter day. Though don't plan on driving."
"O: Overall, this one was very enjoyable and a pleasure to drink. Brouwerij Huyghe puts out a very good BSDA, and I highly recommend it."
"O Overall this is a very nice beer and would get it again (if i can find it again in the new york area)."
"O - Wonderful Christmas beer and very drinkable. A nice flavor and complexity. I look forward to the Christmas beer of 2011."
"D - Drinkability is moderate. For a brewery that produces one of my all-time favorite beers in Tremens, I can't say I'm not disappointed in Nocturnum and now Noel. Noel starts promising enough with a tantalizing nose, but much of the spices fall away in the taste and are replaced with a bit of an overwhelming kick of alcohol. It doesn't make me feel like this is a Christmas beer in the slightest. Not awful for a Belgian Strong Dark Ale, but if I wanted one of those, I could pick a few others I'd take over this."
"O: This is one fruity and sweet beer but very complex and drinkable. I especially loved the flavors left on my palate after the swallow. Great aftertaste. Cheers!"
"Opened a bottle of this one Christmas 2008, The beer poured out as a bubbly amberish brown color with a light tan fizzy head. The lacing a minimal. The smell of the beer is yeasty and has some spice aromas on the nose. The taste of the beer is a little metallic if it's too cold. Once it warms up the spices and some Belgian yeast start to work together and create a really nice warming brew. The mouthfeel has a bit of a bite to it. It's carbonated generously. Overall I thought this was a pretty good Winter brew."
"O: I thought I’d pretty much be eating oatmeal when I first poured this beer, but, thankfully, it turned out better than that. For Brouwerij Huyghe, it’s probably just another reason to love Belgian yeast; for me, it’s another reason to love Brouwerij Huyghe. Though this has been my least favorite of the Delirium beers, I’ll still probably be adding it to my shopping list come winter. Nothing like pink elephants in Santa hats to get me in the holiday spirit…"
"Overall I really enjoy this beer and I usually pick up a bottle every holiday season and I will continue to do so."
"Wow. I am thoroughly impressed. It says its 10 percent alcohol. It's so fruity that's all I can focus on. Complex fruit flavors. Don't be afraid to follow an imperial stout with this one. Damn I wish I could tell you what fruits. Some people say cherries but I don't get that. Maybe fresh plums and dark grapes. It's unique but totally enjoyable. Get ya two. Drink one and squirrel away one for later."
"O - This beer is quintessentially Belgian. It has flavours that no other country (despite trying) can produce with any authenticity. If you see it, buy it."
"Dr: Given the other brews in Delirium's repertoire, I expected far better. This beer was a damned disappointment. She's priced a bit high for the lackluster quality. She drinks easy but doesn't offer a whole lot. Give her a spin at your own risk, but I'll take me Delirium Red over this shite any day of the fortnight."
"D: Well made and very enjoyable."
"Overall, this was one of the better Belgian Noel's I have had. Very rich and complex, and delightfully smooth I could have had this one again and again."
"Not a bad beer. I'm glad I tried it. Not something I'd go out of my way to git again, but well worth a try."
"I don't remember entirely was this was like, but I don't remember being very impressed. I'll stick to Tremens."
"D: Pretty good for a 10% ABV, however this one was a miss."
"Pink elephants are in abundance during the holidays--we're sure St. Nick is seeing them on his last night of work each year. Clear mahogany color, crackling head downsizes to a thin ring of lace. Smooth and slick, creamy body. Malty with a toastiness throughout; hint of caramel soon leads to a very warming alcohol. Candied tropical fruit and raisins mesh well with a spiciness from the alcohol and hops. Ghost-like herbal phenols barely make any noise. Hint of yeast and more spicy warmth in the end. Tastes like the holidays and drinks like a Belgian beast, pink elephants and all."
"Drinkability: I don't know how to feel about this beer- it's all over the place. It's very good in some aspects, and underwhelming in others. Still, this is an interesting beer that is great for the winter, but inconsistency means that this one is not a favorite."
"Quite a tangy fruit nose on this- cherry pie, lemon, white grape, green banana, cloves. A gentle cascade of tiny bubbled carbonation lends a soft and smooth feel that works well with flavors of cherry liqueur, orange marmalade and candi sugar. The spiciness of the cloves has been smoothed out at this age. Buttery toffee sweetness lingers in the finish. I'm tempted to grab a few bottles to cellar; this was very enjoyable."
"Delirium Noël has a cloudy dark brown colour and a head that goes away quick but maintains lacing. The smell is sweet and malty with hints of honey. The taste is sweet with hints of honey with a toasty malt finish. There is the tang of belgian yeast at the end. This beer is thick and carbonated, so it felt very nice in my mouth. Three words to describe this beer: yummy; roasty; warm."
"D: Nice beer and complimented my xmas dinner quite well. I would love to have this aged."
"D-Not a bad beer by any means, but I was expecting more spice and a richer body."
"D - Really drinkable as the alcohol is hidden well."
"Picked this up for next to nothing at a supermarket in Luxembourg. Super fizzy hazy ruby-amber pour with a two finger head that disappeared in record time and no lacing. Very herbal, spicy, and bready nose with hints of dark fruit and a touch of metal and alcohol. The taste is complex and more malty then I expected. Brown sugar, caramel and molasses dominate with hints of cinnamon, banana and figs and a touch of apple. The mouthfeel is a bit thin. The alcohol is well hidden which makes this sipper fairly drinkable. I was expecting a bit more, but still a decent Christmas beer."
"D: A sipper, not a chugger. Drink more than one and the alcohol is gonna catch up to you quick. It's a nice beer to savor and enjoy with food, or when you have to nurse a beer and want a little flavor in your sipping."
"Pours dark mahogony brown with touches of white foam around the edge. Cloudy some sediment. Malty smell, with hazelnut and chocolate. Smooth rich malty taste, some chocolate, other candied sugar taste, Very light carbonation. Smoother than counterparts. Full of flavor + easy drinker."
"The Rest: Body is full and creamy and drinkability is good for this big of a beer. Very tasty!"
"750ml bottle poured into trappist glass. Pours amber red with a small, disappearing khaki head. The aroma is fruit and spices; mostly cinnamon, apples, plums, pears, and a bit of brown sugar. It's has a surprisingly weak body and little complexity. Kind of a boring beer that I expected more from Delirium on their popular Christmas beer."
"I like this beer -- it doesn't blow me away, but I appreciate it for what it is. The high alcohol is masked well with the caramel malt tones and the abundance of spiced fruit. Considering I bought it on discount, I can't regret giving it a try."
"This beer is absolutely delicious. I have had this and the tremens many times, and time and time again, this stands out as the better tasting beer, regardless of its 10 percent alcohol content.Poured about a finger and half to 2 fingers of head, that dissipated rather quickly. Poured a dark, deep brownish red color. I always notice a bit of sweet taste when I first start drinking this, but it's not an overpowering sweet taste. This beer is just extremely delicious and really stands out. My friend likes this beer more than the tremens as well. It's a bit sweeter and has less of a ""bite"" then the tremens all while having a higher alcohol content."
"D- Solid beer and very easy to drink and I will look forward to this next winter and the ones to follow"
"D: An enjoyable beer, but a little too sour for me."
"Mouthfeel is very smooth. The alcohol is well masked by the flavour. The beer lacks of the carbonation, but overall it's ok."
"Cheers."
"Overall, a very good christmas beer. I will definitely be seeking this out again next year."
"At 10abv the alcohol is very well hidden. Good drinkability but the sweetness wears on you after a while."
"Overall: A solid offering although it does not stand out to me as a true Christmas seasonal."
"Look for this at your local store"
"D: This is solid but not great."
"D-this is a wonderful belgian brew that i'll look forward to every christmas. it took me awhile to finish, but only because i wanted to savor the flavor. the taste stays great."
"D: Flavorful with nice interaction of yeast, malt and spices. Big ABV keeps this one a sipper."
"D: A very fine Christmas ale and, as I've said, far and away the best Delirium I've had. Definitely recommended. A sipper -- I split the bottle and only barely regret it. I'm still not a big Delirium fan, but I would buy another of these. The label is simply awesome...flying pink elephants pulling Santa's sleigh full of beer."
"All-around, this is pretty decent. Very drinkable for something 10% ABV."
"Overall impression: this might have been spoiled, as it had minimal carbonation and a tangy taste. however, i've noticed the same characteristics in the last two years."
"It's hard not to compare this to Tremens & Nocturnum, both which I prefer to what I just had, which is why for the low score. I've had plenty of BSDAs I prefer to Noel, that's for sure. Kind of a bummer, I have to say, but like I said before...maybe next year I'll give it another shot."
"Rather light (in both taste & color) for this type of beer. Certainly enjoyable, but not much spices, and virtually no dark fruits, for an Xmas beer just doesn't seem right."
"D - This has pretty good drinkability. It goes down smooth. I think this is a good christmas beer, and I would definitely try this beer again."
"Have not had any other brews from Brouwerij Huyghe, but this makes me want to consider their other offerings. Overall a tasty holiday fare."
"d - good beer but it doesn't leave me wanting more."
"I think this is a good Christmas beer, not as good as a Corsendonk but very drinkable and something I won't ever turn down."
"Also reviewed by JAbel9"
"This is a sweet, malty beer that hides its 10% abv well. Great for a Christmas feast."
"Verdict: Just like the other two beers from Huyghe I've tried, this is an incredibly solid and thoroughly Belgian experience. I think I've found a new entry for my winter seasonal must-buy roster."
"After having this beer on tap and not being very impressed, I decided to give the Noel another try from the bottle. Delerium Noel is not necessarily my favorite seasonal beer, but I must say that the bottle was much better than the draft. I noticed differences in the carbonation and the spice between the two, and felt that the bottle presented these aspects in a stronger manner than the draft. Overall I still feel that the beer is muted. I wish it had just a little more ""oomph"" to the spice or to the maltyness. I know I can be a bit of a difficult judge regarding the winter season of beers, but after multiple exposures to this beer, I feel it is just a bit overrated and feel it to be quite average."
"jd"
"Drinkabilty - Its for sure a christmas beer. Due to it being seasonal and 10%, this for sure is a session, 1-2 and done beer. Very tastly, this for sure is my favorite delirium ale!"
"Pours a much darker color then expected, nice foam head. Smell seems a little off not sure if bottle experienced heating etc. Taste is very smooth for a 10% brew and I would seek another one out given the opportunity. I actually like this one much more then the original delirium tremens."
"I would highly recommend this beer. My wife and I drank it together on our snow day from work, and we enjoyed it immensely."
"O: This is a great beer for the winter season, warming with flavors that evoke the Christmas season. I can curl up with this by a fire while watching It's a Wonderful Life."
"A very good seasonal offering. Glad I found it and yes, I will be back for more..ho ho ho!!"
"Yawn. Lacking complexity. Poor value."
"CHEERS!!"
"I could drink a few of these myself, however because of the high ABV, this would be a one pour for most people. This is great beer, and another great Deliruim brew. Great Holiday Brew!!"
"D: Quite drinkable and one of my favorite Christmas seasonals every year. Very smooth for a 10%er. Highly recommend."
"Overall, pretty good, pretty much what I would expect from a Delirium. Could easily return to this, perhaps in front of a fire on a snowy evening."
"It's like Delirium's spicy cousin that comes to holiday parties. Awesome every once in a while, but you wouldn't want to live with them."
"Aged very well, I prefer it to the fresh. Recommended for cellaring. Would love to see it with another 2 years on it."
"A good xmas ale, a slightly sour entry that is unusual."
"D: One thing that I don't recognize in tasting this beer is the high alcohol content. Very dangerous beer indeed, yet with its price tag...not so much. Easy sipping beer on a cold night approaching the holidays. Not sure I will be splurging to grab more of these though."
"A worthy offering - I think I prefer the regular delirium, but as a Christmas brew this works."
"This brew pours a very dark amber hue with beautiful carbonation that leaves behind a creamy two finger head that stays with heaps of sporadic lacing and a nice rim aswell,the smell is basically pretty much like xmas pudding with hints of brandy,cherries,caramel coated bread and some dried fruits,it has a rather beautiful mouthfeel which is dense,thick,creamy and nicely carbonated and the tastes are what you expect from the aroma with flavours of cherries,brandy coated fruit,bready malts and finishes with a bittersweet strawberry finish and overall i cant believe i have not sampled this brew before as it is a quite exceptional drop and given its 10%ABV it really hides it quite well so therefore i say its definately a sipper as the sweetness in this brew makes it easy to knock back."
"D: Quite drinkable for a high ABV beer, I will absolutely be adding this beer to my seasonal purchase list as it makes a great Christmas beer."
"D- since I love beers that have very apparent high abv, I could drink a couple bombers to myself. Otherwise one pour is probably good for most people. Its a great beer, I like most of what they put out anyhow so I am pleased that I really enjoyed this"
"Pours a clear dark amber with highly active carbonation. Scent is yeasty and boozy with notes of watery and dark fruit and minimal spice. Taste again brings a big punch of yeast and alcohol up front, the nice notes of watery and dark fruit a bit difficult to appreciate and the light spicing even more so. Lighter side of medium bodied, active carbonation, dry and lingering. I will revisit and this bottle just seemed way too boozy, disguising all the other flavors and scents."
"Poured this into a tulip. Pretty standard looking on this one. Dark mahogany colored body with about a finger of off white head that settles down to a thin layer of foam in moments wit decent runny lace. Lots of malt right away in the aroma with kind of a banana bread aroma. Alongside all that is hints of seasonal spices like nutmeg and cloves. Overall the aroma is pretty sweet, but I like sweet things. Again, real sweet and malty with spices associated with the holidays coming through in the pallet. It starts malty with a toffee undertone with a gingerbread kind of flavor. It's actually really enjoyable, but I'm only three sips in. Not quite as heavy as I had imagined this to be, but not much to complain about in the mouthfeel otherwise. Kind of a sipper and I feel like this is a bit on the sweet side. I only had the 11.2 ounce bottle but I still feel like I could have shared it rather than go it alone this time."
"nicely balanced seasonal brew - The spices are more evident as it warms- Enjoy it slowly and you will be enjoying a great seasonal selection by Delirium - Cheers !"
"Value wise this beer was a real disappointment. It's very expensive ($18 a four pack), it looks awful and doesn't really stand out in any other way."
"M/D - pretty lively. leaves a nice alcohol tingle. nice treat, not really something i'd drink regularly."
"D: So so, The sweetness and the high ABV does have me wanting more than 1 in a single sitting."
"D: Good. No mistake, another delicious Delirium specimen. Enjoy it!"
"D- alcohol is extremely well hidden and this beer was much easier to enjoy once i decanted it. ran through a tight mesh strainer from my delirium glass and into my duvel tulip, carbonation has been enlivened and flavors enhanced either due to warming, agitation, or both. treated as one of the above mentioned fortified wines, this lil elephant fares much better with me and has in turn generated a much better score than it would have otherwise."
"P- Overall a nice winter beer. A few bottles will probably accompany me on snowboard trips this season."
"Great brew... I liked this one a lot. Puts me in the Christmas spirit even if its only November..."
"I am not impressed with this beer. It is almost watery tasting, yet strong. I am hoping I just have a bad batch or bottle. I really enjoyed other Delirium beers much more than this one."
"D: I still think Tremens is the best of the bunch, but this is by no means a bad beer."
"D: The alcohol is very well masked from the taste, which makes this beer not too difficult to drink, although it is better sipped considering the alcohol content."
"D: A cool beer and definitely appropriate in the pantheon of great Christmas beer. The label's a classic. A clear must try."
"I couldn't see drinking this on the reg but definitely a nice change up every now and then. Not too malty either which is a plus."
"Taste: Smooth with a moderate bitterness. Belgian yeast, apple, and unidentifiable dark fruits. Alcohol is noticeable but not unwelcome. Gives it a nice warmth in the finish."
"D- overall a damn drinkable beer once you get over how ugly it is, esp. for 10+% ABV, reminded me of an o'fest on belgian steroids, but still had to take off for those nasty chunks, i actually had to close my eyes at one point"
"Notes: Not sure if this was a slightly compromised beer with the way it poured and smelled. However, it still tasted good. If this beer was not up to what it should be then it would be a great beer sampled fresh. I'll make sure to get another bottle."
"D: Some nice flavors, but it was just missing something. Keg was recently tapped but sometimes they have some issues with Belgian kegs -- might give it a second chance next winter."
"D - Overall this is a big step up from my Edition 2005 I had last month. Solid brew but I think it might be better with less age..."
"The tartness is a little unappealing and takes away from the drinkability of this brew IMO."
"Pours a clear dark amber with a thin line of offwhite head. Lacing clings just about everywhere all over the glass. Aroma of malt, citrus and some subtle spices. Sweet malt taste that is quite warming. Dry fruit character is throughout the taste before finishing dry and quite warmng. Low amount of carbonation with a medium feel. Yeast comes through more in the taste as it warms. Despite the draft pour being too cold, it stood no chance in trying to help mask the ever present and forward alcohol warmth and character. Overall not bad but not something I would seek out."
"Drinkability: Can enjoy one or two glasses but the alcohol will catch up after that but otherwise the alcohol is well covered so the few glasses are very enjoyable."
"Beer is smooth and medium bodied. Slight metallic flavor to the whole thing but overall the flavors are solid. Sweet, bready, yeasty flavors throughout. Carbonation in the mouth is good, the sweetness is the star of this beer. Mouthfeel is OK and drinkability is good. Not my favorite but I wouldn't actively avoid it either."
"D- I can drink this Christmas brew ANYTIME. I thought it was so tasty and well rounded."
"Overall - Good base flavors, but a few elements knock this one down - namely lots of flaky yeast, a bit too strong on the sweet side, and distractingly vigorous carbonation."
"D: Low drinkability. This one is complex and powerful. Definitely a sipper."
"Aroma is typical of the style, very belgian: dark fruits, raisins and sweet malts. Flavor is similar, sweet clean and malty, slightly spicy and fruity. Carbonation is high and mouthfeel is crisp and clean, not syrupy. I'll easily drink the whole bottle of this."
"Pretty good BSDA here. A nice dark brown with an inch or so of tan head. Second glass has a tremendous amount of sediment floaties in it. Smell is good, dark fruit and raisins, a bit of alcohol. Taste is pretty similar, a nice strong BSDA, raisins, overripe fruit, alcohol. MF is a bit thin for me, I would like a bit more creaminess. Drinkability is also good, a nice sipper for sure."
"Drinkability- Very Nice, I loved it. It is a very good belgian dark ale."
"Eric"
"The one downfall of this ale is the thin mouthfeel. For the strength of the flavors it seems that there isn't enough textured support for the tastes. Perhaps more age would do the beer well. I found the drinkability decrease as the glass emptied due to the slight pungency in the thin liquor. A little more robustness and denser malt flavor may have balanced it out a bit for me."
"Beware! Sip with caution as this ale is extremely easy drinking with the 10.0ABV almost not evident and well hidden, like an elephant in the tall grass, waiting to charge."
"D - Very drinkable and alcohol is well hidden. Great ale for the holidays."
"D- I will continue to get this once a year around christmas time. Im celebrating the new year with this one though. I would have no problem taking down a bomber of this. A great beer that was one of the first beers I drank about nine years ago."
"D - characteristic belgian strong ale. Easy to drink until alcohol takes over!"
"D: This was my favorite of the Belgian Strong Darks I had on Christmas Eve. A perfect compliment to a cold evening."
"D - This Noel is quite a beer, and a wonderful use of clever label art, makes this one a welcome Delirium"
"I put the entire 750 down over about 4 hours. I like this beer aged, and recommend taking the time to do it if you like it ""new."""
"Poured cloudy orange color with white miniml head fir a Belgian. Aroma has the Belgian yeast smell I expected, and dark fruits as well. Taste is a wonderful assortment of dark fruits from raisin and plum and fig, get candied sugar as well, but what I don't get is the 10. Abv which is astounding. Mouthfeel us medium and a but creamy actually. Great beer. This might be my new holiday brew to have every year at christmas."
"Drinkability: Relatively simple Belgian Christmas Ale but still quite nice and that 10% abv is very well hidden."
"D - Didn't even notice that this was 10%. Could have easily knocked out another. Always one of my Xmas favorites."
"Drinkability: The extreme amount of sediment took me by surprise. Had I known there would be so much, I would have eased up on my pour a bit. That being said, this is a tasty and highly drinkable beer, and one of the better choices of beer my wife has gotten for me."
"Pours with very little head and only manages to maintain a thin cap of foam. A bit disappointing in that regard but the warm coppery color is inviting for whatever that's worth. The nose presents some spiciness, yeast, and a candy sugar quality. Overall, a pleasant and alluring aroma. The flavor carries much of the same with an added hint of oaky vanilla and rum-soaked fruit. The mouthfeel is nicely carbonated and has good body but the alcohol peaks through a bit more than I'd like. It was a bit hot and could be more balanced in this respect. Generally speaking it's a good beer that I would recommend trying but it could certainly stand some cellaring. I drank this one a month or so after it's release. Definite aging potential but in it's youthful state I found it missed the mark slightly."
"I'm not sure where the penny/copper taste came from, the beer was fresh and the cap opened with an audible noise of releasing gases. But that taste did throw off my enjoyment of the beer."
"Medium carbonation and mouthfeel. Pretty drinkable as it's not heavy and the carbonation is lively."
"I'm impressed. Delirium Noël's probably the most interesting BSDA I've ever had. It's a little left of center in that the spices and dark fruit are more subtle and complementary rather than being front and center. Since it's so tasty, I'm okay with that. There's plenty of flavor to make up for whatever shortcomings it may have. What a Christmas beer! Go find a bottle before it disappears until next year."
"Not much of a head, thin layer of dark brown bubbles across the surface with minimal retention and no lacing. Kind of an orange to brown hued liquid, mostly transparent with some light bending of the light, widely dispersed bubbles. The nose comes across with peat, flint, tar and earth, borderline sweaty, before orange peel, peach pit and hard toffee candy appear, pinch of clove spice. Light to medium-bodied with a fast rising carbonation, within a nanosecond starts foaming up towards your mouth roof. Only slightly sweeter here, noticeably dry on the whole. Touch extra caramel, toffee and depth in the orange citrus and pear, apple, fig, apricot fruit. Retains sourness via the forest floor, peat moss, tarry earth elements, you never really stop puckering. Even at warmer temperatures does not smooth out or deepen as one would hope. Maybe I'm missing something here."
"D: Very drinkable for a rich, flavorful beer. Smooth considering its strength."
"M&D: very mild in carbonation, full-bodied yet just slightly alcoholic when it reaches the finish. Although there's hardly any sign of real spices used in this ""X'mas beer", the flavour shows some input of spicy yeastiness, hence a decent drinkability overall."
"D- This beer is awesome. I would neveer say that I have had a better winter/christmas beer."
"Overall a unique Christmas brew but not my favorite, still damn good though."
"The beers from the Huyghe brewery really have to be enjoyed on tap. Having tried this beer in the bottle, it is good. On tap, unbelievable. It becomes fresher and more flavorful, it's more carbonated which helps balance it; the beer almost pulls a night and day comparison with the difference. That being said, not easy to track down on tap unless you go abroad (this took me two years to find, but well worth the wait)."
"Pours with no head at all into a goblet. Color is a thick looking amber. The nose is primarily fruity with cherries, and almost smells like apples. The taste is very very sweet and fruity with no bitterness at all. There is a noticable alcoholic aftertaste though that is slightly unpleasant. Mouthfeel is very thick and syrupy, I'm not totally surprised though given the alcohol content. The bottle I'm drinking is a 750ml bottle o the 2009 vintage and it seems to me that the beer could do with a little bit of aging to let some of the burn mellow out."
"Quite a good beer, by far one of the better imports in this style!"
"Overall, a disappointment. Too sweet and candy-like. I figured that the age would help round off the edges but this one still seems too sweet."
"The beers from the Huyghe brewery really have to be enjoyed on tap. Having tried this beer in the bottle, it is good. On tap, unbelievable.

That being said, not easy to track down on tap unless you go abroad (this took me two years to find, but well worth the wait)."
"Drinkability: A highly drinkable beer considering the high abv. I will look for this again but only one per session as the alcohol is very present. I really like the apple taste in the beginning."
"D: Very tasty, goes down easily, highly drinkable for such a high ABV."
"This is a dark brown colored beer with hues of purple. Head retention is okay in this beer. Its aroma is very potent. Lots of pear, grapes, figs, and a kick of alcohol. Served cool, it is great tasting. The alcohol is there, but kept more at bay. There's some tasty grape, candi sugar, some pear, and the yeast is working in some otehr fruity flavors. As it is consumed warmer, the alcohol heats up and slows down the enjoyability of this beer, but it is still a beer to look forward to this Christmas."
"Note - Decent beer? yes. $100+ a case beer? No"
"Not the greatest beer but def decent IMO. Maybe have again but a lot others i would get before."
"Drinkability: Its not the greatest BSDA, but its a tasty beer with well hidden alcohol. At roughly $30 for a six pack (by volume), its not a good deal. There are much better BSDAs for the same or less. Mine was undercarbonated, and that may play into the evaluation, but I dont think my overall thoughts will change."
"Drinkability is pretty good! It goes down pretty easy for the style. Drinking the whole bottle would be no problem in one sitting. It may not be the best example of the style in terms of complexity but its stil a pretty tasty brew. I wouldn't mind having it again."
"The consistency and balance are lacking. Sweet/sour components are dominant here, with a strange, off-putting character because of the earthiness in that mix."
"D- Drinks really well for a high abv and has a nice flavor, can easily enjoy a 750 without much effort."
"Drinkability: I'm loving the flavors, but that super sweet maltiness is a bit much after a while and the 10% ABV would be a bit much after a while as well; but definitely not a disappoint drink at all and I will gladly drink it again at some point."
"Recommended music pairing: Louis Armstrong - What a Wonderful Christmas"
"It is interesting. Difficult and strong, but interesting. It's got a lot going on. Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't. It's one of the more complex BSDAs I've had. I wouldn't let the relatively low average review here. including my own, dissuade you from trying this."
"It had a nice dark red color, smells malty, brandy and fruity. I like the mouthfeel with it's medium density and tight bubbles. Tastes of sweet carmal and notes of brandy and fruit."
"D - Excellent drinkability for a strong ale. Light and smooth enough for longer drinking sessions. Rich and hearty enough for a winter session. Alcohol is masked very well."
"Delirium Noel warms me with each sip, making me appreciate the bounty of flavors it offers. Great beer! Each new Beligian beer I try shows me what I've been missing."
"D: The 10% is virtually undetectable. The only thing that this beer is missing on the drinkability category is due to its high level of sweetness which after a while could become cloying."
"D: I wish they had this on rotation earlier in the night. Being the DD required me to only have a little bit of this one. Excellent beer."
"Has a very bubbly mouthfeel and gives a nice warm feeling going down. This beer is easy to drink and the 10% ABV isn't anything to shake your finger at! A decent brew."
"Perfect nightcap, I savored ever one of the 750ml in my bottle and it was enough. (that's not to say I couldn't have more, however I cannot say that I am not satisfied."
"Drinkability: This is a nice drinkable beer that is worth trying and drinking. And I certainly would be willing to have another (except for the ABV ☺ ). However, that being said, there are other Christmas ales that I prefer over this one."
"D- A very good Christmas beer, the alcohol level is the only thing to slow me down."
"salud!"
"Light to medium body with lots of active carbonation initially, but rather smooth shortly thereafter. Really not bad, but not what I typically expect from the style. Great aroma, but the sweetness on the tongue is a little overdone and hinders overall drinkability somewhat for me. The spices mellow it out a little by the end, but the middle of each sip unfortunately was the low point. Good to try once, but I probably won't revisit...well at least not until next year."
"Spicy amber with lots of rich malt, in a brew with extremely clear malt. Easy drinking, especially for the style. Only a slight touch of the yeast associated with the Tremens, but the fruit flavors are there. There almost seems to be a bit or sourness on the finish though.. I am wondering if this is intentional."
"Not disappointing for a first try, but from the reviews, it appears there are much better Deliriums out there."
"Overall, a pretty enjoyable brew, though lacking the complexity that had anticipated. There are definitely better examples of the style out there, but this is definitely worth a shot."
"Overall, a decent effort but there are better Delirium offerings."
"A good beer, I suppose. Fitting for Christmas, but pales in comparison to Nocturnum and Tremens."
"d- fairly drinkable, at first I didn't really think of this as a Christmas brew, but as the malt and fruit came through I could see why this is their Christmas release,"
"Drinkability: This is a nice Christmas time beer to enjoy in the evening with a few logs on the fire, but the alcohol will keep you warm as well."
"A fairly unremarkable seasonal offering. I'm not saying it was bad, just nothing really special about it which made me yearn for more."
"Overall, decent, and very typical of Belgian style brews. Warming and festful!"
"Cheers!"
"Light brown with a thick white head, long retention with good lacing. VERY sweet, malty aroma, heavy on the caramel. Medium mouth, subtle vanilla flavor, maybe some light spice, lots of malt with some hops to balance, but not enough. Little aftertaste. ""Quick and done."""
"glassware: tulip"
"Fizzy raisin-rum cake gives way to Saaz bittering hops on the back of the tongue. Yeasty sourdough and vegetation make an appearance alongside dark fruits, spices, and warming booze. Well-hidden alcohol given the ABV. Mouthfeel is bubbly and of medium thickness, with a sticky, spicy finish. I encountered Delirium early in my craft beer-drinking career, and I didn't quite care for it then. It was good, just not as great as it had been touted by some. Over four years later, I've reached the same conclusion."
"D: I could have one or two of these beers no problem."
"A feb 2008 vintage.Poured from a 25.4 oz bottle into a pint glass. It poured coppery,brown with a moderate tan head that disapates quickly. . A moderate amount of sediment. The smell is sweet and banana fruity. The taste follows suit with a mild sweetness and a very smooth mouthfeel. The carbonation is about medium. The alcohol is well hidden. I'm not a big fan of the Belgian ale this is one that I would drink again. A very fine beer though I think that aging may have helped."
"Overall this is surprisingly my second favorite brew from this brewery beaten only by Delirium Tremens. Nocturnum is a close third. I would get this again around xmas in order to fully enjoy it in the northeastern winter."
"A very nice Belgian with great Brown sugar sweetness and earthy dark stone fruits. The beers pours a translucent deep red with good lacing. The aroma is a tad sweet but still very good with bursts of raisins, brown sugar and vanilla. The flavor is similar, caramelized brown sugar and dark sweet dried fruits. The feel is wonderful, particularly as it loses carbonation over time. I'm giving it a high drinkability score for a sweet Christmas Belgian ale. It's a bit too decadent for me to want one every night, but I'd certainly enjoy one during the holiday season. I cellared this bottle for about 6-9 months, so it was fairly fresh."
"D- easy to finish and im left with the desire to grab more of these before theyre all gone. ill be waiting to check this one out when fresh."
"Conclusion: Not nearly as amazing as when fresh or on tap (one of my favorite Belgians in both cases)...decent here, but nothing all that remarkable"
"Notes: This is a wonderful and very enjoyable beer. Very well done, cheers Delirium Noel!!!"
"Mouthfeel was medium to full in body with lots of tiny carbonation bubbles."
"Nice dark fruits and spice up front. Not nearly as sweet as it smells. No alcohol taste whatsoever. Nice sting on the tongue. Fairly dry finish. Fuller body than expected, but a really creamy, plush feel. Carbonation level is appropriate. Pretty easy drinker."
"d - The 10% ABV is almost totally masked and I enjoy the taste. Yeah, that counts for a pretty high score."
"From a 750mL bottle with several elephants in Santa hats being driven by Mr. Claus himself. Corked 2006, foil covering. Nose was of bananas, pears, apples, and some alcohol. Pours a ripe peach with off-white head that stuck around for a bit, but formed quickly. Translucent, with some carbonation visible; light came through pretty clearly. A nice beer to look at. Taste of phenols, spice, currants, belgian yeast. The finish was disappointingly syrupy, sticking to my tongue a bit more than I would have liked. Seems like a very Fall-ish beer. Mouthfeel was lightly carbonated, with medium mouthfeel; probably won't be able to finish the entire bottle. A decent seasonal brew, but there are too many other worthy Browns to make this one a future purchase."
"D: This beer is simple and easy to drink, not harsh or off putting. However, for the price, I expected more in the way of taste."
"Please do yourself a favor, and if you do decide to pick this up and try it, don't drink it at refrigerator temperature or out of a regular pint glass. Find a proper Belgian-style goblet / tulip glass or at least use a snifter. And serve it at 55 or so degrees. Otherwise you'll miss out on so much of what this beer has to offer in scent and taste."
"Pours a very dark brown colored body, with particles suspended. Also, a big foamy white colored head, quickly diminishing. Has a dark fruity aroma, very floral. Alcoholy, and floral taste. Thick tasting palate. Very tasty."
"A nice example of the style. Not the best but still quite drinkable."
"This beer is a favorite of mine and I was happy to be able to obtain a bottle of it to drink this year. I like the darker malt and fruit tastes that I get with the beer and also the characteristic acidity that most belgians have. Good buy, go try."
"Certainly the best Christmas beer I have tasted so far."
"Overall good seasonal beer, not the best though. Alcohol was the main flavor i think, wouldnt be my first choice for a belgium, but like most belgiums its still very drink able"
"Good Belgian strong ale. Solid dark brown color with a sizable head that fades quickly without maintenance. Smell is a bit strange, slightly off from the taste. It is ridden with spices. Coriander and orange peel, it's all there. A little over-the-top. The taste, however, is wonderful. Well balanced sugar and alcohol. Slight burn in the throat but not unpleasant for a winter seasonal. Given time in the beer locker I would imagine this beer developing extremely well. The spices are actually balanced well with the sugar and add a complexity to the beer that a lot of dark Belgians can't claim. The alcohol is a bit much and detracts from drinkability. Great winter-warmer, recommended in season or out!"
"A very flavorful strong Belgian. This offering is more of the rich variety than others. One holiday offering that I will return to year after year."
"The body is moderate and some warming effects. Sure Belgian x-mas beers are all over the place, but this one just seems to be lacking that definite Belgian and spice character. Some noticeable off notes, there is more to desire for this one."
"Received a bottle of this beer for Christmas and was eager to break it open, as I have yet to be disappointed with a Delirium selection. Color is dark with just a hint of amber. Surprisingly little amount of head and very little lacing on the glass. Very fruity aroma with a nice subtle hint of clove and nutmeg. The taste is sweetly fruity up front with an earthy, malty, and slightly alcoholic finish. Very soft mouthfeel and pleasingly warming. Despite its high alcohol content (10%) it is not overwhelming. Very enjoyable on its own, but would also pair well with pork dishes or as a dessert beer. Not the best beer to come out of Belgium (or even the Huyghe Brewery), but certainly worth a try."
"Pours a dark amber with perhaps a purple tint. Head dissipates rather quickly, leaving no lacing in its path. Aroma is filled with strong dark fruit, followed by clove, pepper and a touch of alcohol. Taste is sweet sweet sweetness. A symphony of dark fruits. Prune for sure. Cherries. Plum. Fantastic, but very very sweet. Maybe too sweet. Mouthfeel is rather normal, a light effervesense. A little sticky in the finish. This is a nice beer if yoru a fan of the fruit foward flavors. For me its a touch too sweet, some more spice in the palate could cut the sweet nicely. At 10% alcohol though, the alcohol is nicely hidden. A nice warm, sweet xmas brew, but short of remarkable."
"D - This beer made a good start to my Christmas vacation it has a very good taste with just a little alcohol warmth for the season worth trying"
"The question now is do we try the other Delerium products based on a seasonal that wasn't."
"D - Christ, what was I thinking opening this whole bomber by myself? John (macktbone), you're helping me drink the other seven bottles!"
"Delirium Noel pours a copper color with a white head and lot of floating yeasties from a brown twelve ounce bottle wrapped in a gray coating that looks sort of stone like. The aroma reminds me of grapes. The flavor definitely has a wine like character that I find enjoyable. This isn't something I'd want to drink everyday, but it's pretty good."
"This poured a hazy mahogany with light tan head. It smelled like sour but creamy yeast, copper and lemon hops, caramel and oak, with a bit of chocolate malt. It tasted like sweet caramel and milk chocolate malt, creamy yeast with lemon hops, and a bit of nutmeg. It was thick and creamy with a bit of carbonation, and had a bittersweet aftertaste. Overall this was very tasty! It had a good, clean flavor and great body. It hid the alcohol very well and was quite easy to drink. I imagine this could get even better with some age, but it's very nice fresh. It wasn't as good as St. Bernardus, but it wasn't terribly far behind either."
"Pink Elephants aside, Delirium Noël looks like a beer that intends to be a beer. It came in a stately (sans elephants) 75 cl bottle, corked and basket, in opaque glass. There's little notable about the pour, beyond the deep amber colour, and the thin head. There's apples, cinnamon, and what seems to be a few light, phenolic hints in the odour. In the mouth it's smooth, not at all thin, and with perfect amount of crispness to counter this sweet, malty beer. Little citrus zest, though not much, and it first, I confused it with a more peppery flavour. The alcohol becomes apparent as it warms, but so does the `roasted fruits` of indeterminate origin. A heady beer, sweet enough that people must take pains to pace themselves."
"For a 10 percenter, this was quite drinkable in my book. Wish I had more!"
"D - a most pleasant drinking experience."
"Great beer all around, drinking it a bit after the holidays this year, but was able to enjoy on tap over the past 2 months as well and this is just a great warming Belgian Dark for a cold night with some good friends."
"A little hot in the mouth, thanks to that alcohol tinge, but decent beer."
"M/D: Medium to high carbonation with a medium body and smooth finish. I would try drinking this out of a wider-mouth glass to see if it would change the character at all if some of that carbonation escaped a bit more effectively."
"D-Enjoyable and festive, warming."
"Sweet malts and brown sugar up front, before a dry roastiness takes over for the finish with a little bit of hop character. Dry, dark fruits over a spot of spices, like cinnamon or ginger. Medium-bodied with a spot of breadiness giving it a fullness. Balanced mouthfeel, very refreshing. A little boozey, but nothing at all overpowering. If I had to declare it something, I would declare it a Belgian winter warmer. Nice and light on the spice backing a refreshing malty beer. May not be my favorite belgian, but I will be sure to seek it out again."
"Delirium... kudos on this one. Even the gf loved it...!"
"Pours out a very nice mahogany color with somewhat of a disappointing head. I was expecting it to be much bigger and rockier. It also resided rather quickly. The nose is wonderful. It is incredibly spicy and kind of funky, which I know cannot be what it really is...at least to my knowledge I don't know of any wild yeast in the Noel. Nevertheless, it has a wonderful aroma. The taste is much maltier that the nose but less than what I had expected before opening the bottle. There is a also funk-type flavor and spices in the flavor as well. It is definitely light in the mouth for a Belgian Strong Dark. Awesome beer...hands down my favorite of the Delirium series that Huyghe makes."
"D- Very nice here above average beer but not the best."
"Not easy to drink, but great to sip. Pretty good flavors."
"m&d: nice creamy mouthfeel, very drinkable for a 10abv beer"
"A bit thin for something this big. Still, the carbonation isn't out of control and there's a creaminess to the finish that makes for a pleasant drinking experience. Surprised it's taken me this long to try this beer."
"Not my favorite from Delerium, but it is worth a try."
"Taste was a bit fruity again, at first then followed by some rich malts. Deffinatly can tell it's belgian."
"Filling, yet somewhat, and somehow, underwhelming."
"Although it has a 10% alcohol content, it is not as strong and overpowering as other dark, belgian related fare from the monasteries of divine inebration"
"For a 10% ABV offering, this goes down wayyy too easily. This was a good opportunity to revisit an offering I haven't had in a few years. As always, good stuff."
"A good beer that I will probably try again next year."
"D-This is an interesting beer and I'm glad to have enjoyed it with my family. However, not the best of the various Belgian darks I've enjoyed. Still, a complex and festive beer."
"Overall: I am a little disappointed. This beer is good, but not great. I was hoping for more from the the maker of the beer. It seems that there is a separation between the alcohol, malt, and hops. I was hoping that the beer could hid the alcohol better. I did like the fact that there is a very nice hops to the beer but the malt didn't back it up. The mouth feel is astringent with a bitter finish that last for a few minutes. Overall a good beer, better than most."
"A good holiday brew for fireplace sipping and friendly chat"
"Overall - A pretty good Christmas brew... not a great deal of difference between this and the Nocturnum but certainly worth a try..."
"Notes: It may not be fair but I cannot help to compare this ""Delerium"" product with the other two, more popular offerings, Tremens and Nocturnum. As you can tell, it was difficult to differniate this beer from the Nocturnum. This has happened several times, that a beer's ""Christmas"" offering is at or near another of their beers. Count me as dissapointed with that but this remains a great beer."
"D: A nice beer, albeit odd. Lacking some of the complexities someone would expect in a Belgian or a Christmas beer."
"EDIT: A friend came onto BA when I was still logged in and tooled around with my beer notebook in tow. This has been heavily edited, but now properly reflects my notes and opinion."
"Drinkability: By no means my favorite, but it's still a fitting, well-balanced choice for your holiday drinking. I'll give it that much. It is, after all, the holiday season!"
"not too bad."
"Pours murky brownish copper with lots of visible carbonation and medium to large persistant off white head. Aroma is yeasty and phenolic with some earthiness and an herbal note. Taste has a definite sweetness but it is not too prominant. There is a bit of tartness. Fruit notes- pears, plums, and darker fruit. Herbal character as well- there is a juniper/gin note I'm getting from this. Again, as in the nose, phenolic and earthy yeastiness. Well carbonated and medium to full bodied. Very interesting and complex beer. I think it works. A very good and unique Christmas beer."
"Drinkability- very nice Christmas beer, spices and fruit, the warmth of high ABV, without the taste. Not an every day beer, but to share a bottle with a loved one on the holiday, very drinkable."
"The taste is different then what I expected after drinking the other delirium brews. Very light mostly fruit almost prickly on the tongue. For 10% abv this is an extremely light tasting and feeling beer. Its has almost a lambic like taste qualities, yet i can't quit sipping this despite being a malty man stout fan. The best thing about this beer is how easy it is to drink. A few sips into this and I all ready feel more jolly. I think this is a perfect winter warmer, different, balanced and strong."
"Honestly, Noël is a disaster and was a drain pour for me. This was no fluke, mind you--this is my second time trying this one. It fits the typical Huyghe model: lots of sugar, high ABV, and no substance."
"Purchased 650 mL bottle and poured into a pint glass. Was a cloudy mahogany color with a large head. Has a very fruity and malty smell, and this comes across in the taste as well. In addition there is a lingering sour taste afterward that is interesting. Relatively complex beer, and it is very drinkable. High alcohol content prevents one from drinking more than a bottle."
"Pours black with hints of burgundy. Thick, creamy head leads to moderate lacing. Big strong fruity aroma with cherries leading the way. Chocolate sneaks in towards the end. Initial hit is smoother than a fresh bottle, and the beer finishes very well - just the right mix of tart and sweet. 18 months seems about right to age this one, but I'm not sure I'd want to drink it in warm weather!"
"This beer has a pineapple and banana nose with herbs and a little caramel too. The taste is lean with yeast sting and spice, hops and mild caramel in the middle and in the finish. The front of the taste is similar to the nose. The mouthfeel is good and the drinkability is better."
"D; While this beer has its good points, it's not as interesting as some others from Belgium. The taste is simply not as spicy or complex as I'd like. Not a bad beer, but not great either."
"Not too drinkable, the phenolic tastes kind of get in the way, and I wouldn't want more than two glasses."
"Despite the alcohol content, this is a delightfully playful yet complex brew, perfect for sipping in the company of friends during the holidays."
"D: The taste is definitely imbalanced toward the sweet side. Would not be a good session beer, although I am glad to have it as a sipping / dessert ale. The alcohol warms nicely. I would certainly have another bottle next winter, but I see no strong reason to have it again soon."
"M/D: the feel is syrupy and soft with out any grainy bite to it. The drinkability is good but it is not something you would want to go back to often."
"This is a very nice Belgian dark with the sugar and fruit sweetness really dominating throughout."
"Extra: On tap this beer was very good. I bought a bottle the next day, and I believe it was skunked because it wasn't as good. But with that said it was still a very good ale."
"D - Just OK for me, at least compared to the price. Lacked some of the complexity I expected from a seasonal beer."
"D - Strong but nice winter brew."
"Out of a 750ml corked and cage bottle. Pours a hazy honey brown color, somewhat clear, small head that settled into a very light ring, flat looking. The aroma is light, some honey malt and light candi sugar. The taste is sweet, candi sugar and a honey malt; some berry sweetness perhaps some cherry. A nice and simple sweet brew. Raspberry sweet with honey malt; some Belgian yeasty spice, though not strong. Interesting. The feel is fairly light, soft carbonation, a bit sticky. A golden BSDA, a bit one dimensional for a BSDA. Definitely worth a purchase."
"Drinability is good considering the style. Finishing this was not a problem."
"D: alcohol is hidden well and the flavors are nice which makes this pretty drinkable for me"
"D - Good, but could have more viscous to support the mouthfeel."
"D-High, I can enjoy a bomber by myself with no problem. Nice Christmas brew."
"Dark golden color with very little head. Apple is found in the aroma if you look for it, but my first smell gave me nothing but the yeast. Tasted like a very generic belgian ale. No hints of anything that would make this a winter beer, nor anything that would make this worth 10 dollars a bottle. Really dissappointe as I had been really looking forward to trying this. The one upside is that it hides the 10% abv very well, making it very drinkable."
"Turbid,burgundy amber with tons of suspended yeast particles. Fine tan head with nice lace. Smells of mascerated fruit, spices and lemon zest. Tastes of peaches, tobacco and candy sugar all dance together without any one overpowering flavor, nice. Medium sticky mouthfeel with lively carbonation, warming alcohol in the finish. A really good beer, I still like the tremens better though."
"Overall this is a beer right in between Tremens and Nocturnum. A solid beer that's worth a shot."
"Jorge: B (3.7)"
"I really enjoyed this. A great X-mas beer. Bring this to an X-mas party instead of wine and see how people react. Highly recommended."
"Medium amber pours from tap. Nice complex funky smell. Taste is rather thick and straightforward. Flavor is bready with an overwhelmingly dark fruit sweetness. Alcohol is not overwhelming but does provide what they must have been aiming for with the noel name."
"D - overall a good holiday beer. goes down easy with only a slight alcohol burn."
"An awesome beer for the Holiday season that lives up the Delirium reputation in my opinion. Very rich and rewarding but goes down surprisingly easy."
"Pretty easy to drink for the high abv. The alcohol is very well-hidden and the flavor profile is pretty balanced. Not a bad take on the style at all."
"taste is thick, very carbonation, burnt caramel, roasted malt, dark fruits, white pepper, and spice, ends somewhat bitter and with a definite alcohol warming."
"This beer pours a rich ruby brown color. It has smells of fruity malt with a slight alcohol tone. The initial flavor is fruity malt that transitions into a slight alcohol flavor and finishes malty and dry. This is a very nice Belgian Dark and very good for the holidays."
"D: For a 10% beer, this one goes down really easily. Almost zero alcohol flavor and a lighter body. I really enjoyed this beer and will definitely look for it again next winter."
"Pours a cloudy reddish brown with a short off-white head. Dense aroma of malt, cherries, corriander, and dried fruit. Pleasant, velvet mouthfeel. Smooth flavors of candi sugar, malt, nutmeg/cinnamon spice, and alcohol. Sweet without treading into sticky. Definietly a winter warmer."
"On tap at The Red in Santa Cruz. More amber than dark. Tan dense head leaves a ton of lacing. Aromas of orange peel, phenols, and a nice toffee base. Mushy apricot, candi sugar, big orange peel, and earthy and spicy notes make up the flavor profile. Mouthfeel is a little flat but that could just be the tap. Pretty nice beer."
"M = Medium-heavy body, light alcohol burn, good frothiness."
"A lovely sweet-ish, spicy-ish, brew. A nice winter sipper that is easily drinkable because of a nice balance - though has a wintery sweetness - and a reasonably well-covered alcohol for abv level."
"Overall a pleasant winter brew that I will definitely have again."
"Pours a dark blush color with a foamy head that dissipates into a lacing that lasts. Aroma consists mostly of cherries, honey and alcohol. Smooth creamy cherry taste with a decent alcohol presence and slight peppery finish."
"Very good mouthfeel on a curious beer. Not as good as the other offerings from Delerium."
"While a good brew I would not want to drink more than the bottle in front of me before moving on."
"Overall: A very solid strong dark or whatever you want to call it; it's dark and it's strong. Flavors are a bit muted with nothing really standing out: no strong fruitiness, sweetness, caramel, etc. Very well balanced, perhaps to a fault. Overall a very solid brew and definitely worth a try."
"Served a nice crisp ruby red with a thin quickly diminishes to a thin layer. Aroma was nice sweet fruits and candy with some Belgian yeast. Taste is very sweet, almost gelatin like, but tolerable. The mouth is only slightly heavy with some warming alcohol. This is a decent beer for a cold November night."
"I love the balance and the strength of flavors. This is a serious(ly-good) beer."
"D - extreamly drinkable for 10% nice and light taste and feel"
"Fantastic beer."
"Pours a relatively clear reddish-mahogany in color with only about a /4"" of bone white head that quickly dissipates. Nice aroma, lots of fruity esters, some malt and spicinesses with minimal amounts of alcohol. Esters are mostly of darker fruits like plums and cherries but there do seem to be some pears lurking beneath the surface. Phenols are peppery, malt is mostly caramel with a touch of bread and alcohol is light with a slightly perfumey character. Taste is reminiscent of the aroma in the all the above aromas are present in the flavor but they are present in different intensities. Malt seems to be much more prevalent here with bready/caramel undertones. Esters are again plums and dark cherries but pears and some other lighter fruits remain. Towards the finish there is a more notable alcohol presence than in the aroma. The alcohol is distinctly rose-like and very pleasant. Esters seem to linger into the finish and are joined by the peppery phenols that were found in the aroma but, until this point, absent from the flavor. Good mouthfeel, medium body with moderate carbonation. Drinkability is quite good. Very enjoyable and while not perfectly to style an excellent beer to drink in the cooler months (or any other time for that matter)."
"Taste is a delicate array of caramel,spiced prunes,pears,rum-soaked raisins,cherrys,nutmeg, spicy gingerbread. What a perfectly balanced array of holiday sweets with an equal array/balance of spicy nutmegs, cinnamon, and gingery-alcoholic warmness. It is full-bodied and warming at the same time a great cup o' ""nog"" if you will. I will look foward to this one each year."
"The mouthfeel was heavier than expected with a suprisingly bubbly texture. The taste initially came off as caramel, cinnamon bun with malty and boozy finish. Nice warming finish. As the beer warmed up you were able to taste hints of cherry and strawberry."
"Drinkability: Overall a decent beer, but the spices are too prominent in the flavor profile and dominate the overall taste. It's not nearly as good as Delirium Nocturnum from the same brewery, and really not worth the cost in my opinion. Probably won't buy again soon."
"Pours with a nice amber appearance with a solid half inch head. Smell is a great blend of fruit, wine and yeast. Taste maintains some of the qualities of the aroma, with a winelike presence and distinct tartness. Mouthfeel is dry and crisp...very refreshing. Overall, the qualities make for an extremely drinkable brew despite the high abv."
"D - Gotta let it warm up for sure. But a little better than the taste would allow you to be."
"The mouthfeel was smooth and viscous with a good balance of bubbles"
"D - Excellent beer but I'd like to see the heat and carbonation turned down. Good for something different come Christmas time."
"Smooth and velvety in the mouth with just the right amount of carbonation, this Delirium is mild and fairly quaffable. Pink elephants make me happy in general, and the flying ones are really kickass! Delirium Noel  is another winner from the elephant trainers at Huyghe!"
"This brew is fantastic on its own or paired with the right food. It has the classic Belgian candy sugar tone to it nestled nicely within all that complexity. I should note that the beer I sampled was from the previous years Christmas stock (from Christmas 2007) and I don't really know if that was for the better or worse. All I know is that this stuff rocks and I would highly recommend it to anyone interested in a beautiful Belgian dark ale."
"It smelled yeasty with maybe a tinge of apricot there. Nice creamy mouthfeel with only a slight carbonation. The taste was of malted fruit with a slight alcohol finish. A nice warming drink that I probably wouldn't of sampled on the ninety degree day that I did had it not been brought over by my buddy to sample. Would be better on a chilly winters evening or around the campfire. I will try again under these circumstances for sure. But the price was right so I said ""hell let's have Christmas in July"""
"Picked up this one out of season, must have been a left over. Served it chilled in my Duvel chalice. Poured a rich mahogany with a wee lacy head. Smelled almost like a fresh holiday fruit cake. Candied fruits and hints of brown sugar riding pink elephants danced in my nostrils. The taste was like a fine Belgian Kreik with a distinct black cherry flavor riding on pink elephants on my palate. The same alcohol overpowered the pink elephants though leaving a nice warmth that would have been perfect on a icey winter's morn'."
"D- This is an amazing brew. I feel sad that I haven't tried any delirium up until this point. If youhave not yet tried this brew I definitely recommend that you do. The aroma alone is worth it. The taste is also incredible."
"I'll stay away from this."
"D - Meh. I just didn't go for this one. It was a little bit of good, but mostly discomfiting. I don't think I will have again."
"I can't say much wrong about this beer other than that it did not engage me. The pale Delirium is a lot better, for my money. But try this one once, 'cause it's alright."
"Alcohol is completely hidden. This one is a true gem."
"US version with X-mas name. Pours dark with some head. Aged about two years. Yeast and spice in nose. Drinks very well, with light chocolate. Absolutely dark fruit.10% is hidden but everpresent.Smooth drinker, though significant candy has been added."
"Pours brownish-red, more red than brown, with not much of a head and a lot of floating particles. It smells very candyish, with a dose of alcohol. The taste is very distinct, a little syrupy and sweet with tart green apples, but not over the top...it is very enjoyable. It goes down nicely, with a slight burn an leaves your mouth dry, wanting more. I really enjoyed this brew...it is more distinct than other holiday offerings I have had from other breweries. Can't wait for next holiday season to pick up some more..."
"Recommended, especially if you like stronger, more full-bodied beers..."
"Drinkability - Maybe it's not as bad as I think. I'm kinda biased as I don't care for Delirium anyway, but I found the Noel to be worse than the average Nocturnum."
"Beer poured a cloudy amber with very little head on an agressive pour. Nose is very sweet, of ripened fruits primarily. Taste is of the dark fruits, candied sugars, with a slight alcohol burn on the finish. Mouthfeel is medium bodied but not overly smooth as expected for the style. Drinkability is pretty good. This is not an overly complex beer and was somewhat dissapointing given the style and origin. Will not try again."
"Drinkability- I like this one a lot, both in the bottle and on the tap handle, it is worth multiple pours."
"Split a bottle of this with my brother around Christmas, another fairly dark ale with a tart fruity taste. had a white foam head. The smell was of fruit particularly cherries and apples. The taste was somewhat like a fruit salad in a good way having different flavors arise at different times when sipping. The mouthfeel was similar to a sparkling wine, not as heavy as some beers I've drank. At 10 ABV in a 750 for the price it is, not one I'd drink by myself."
"Delerium Noel pours a hazy amber with a nice creamy head but a lot of suspended floating chunks. The aroma is sharp and fruity with plenty of yeasty esters. The flavor is crisp and moderately sweet and estery and a bit medicinal. The alcohol leaves it with a slightly vinous character. Overall not a bad beer, but the floating chunks kind of take away from it."
"It is a light-bodied beer with a slight citrus taste, but more or less a grainy spice is on the palate. Somewhat of a backbite but it finishes smooth. Somewhat springy and hoppy, not too much else. An alright brew, but nothing I am really going to seek out again."
"Poured into a Delirium Tulip a very nice dark amber color, very nice carbonation, nice one-finger plus creamy tannish head, lots of nice creamy sticky lacing follows. The nose is malty, some yeast, figs, prunes, plums, and a nice touch of caramel. The taste is somewhat sweet, malty/yeasty, dark fruits, and caramel. Medium body, a well-rounded/complex brew. Alcohol is hidden very well for a brew like this. Very drinkable, this is a very tasty brew and highy recommended if you can get your hands on some."
"Pours a dark ruby red with a decent head that thins and laces the glass. Cherries, red win and other fruits in the aroma. The cherries shine through in the taste with other dark fruit like plums and raisins; definitely a bent towards the sweeter side in this ale. Very smooth, hides the alcohol well. Tasty, sweet and very drinkable. Not as good as Tremens, but very solid."
"D: To me, this tasted good, but the rest of the package was average, if not worse. It's been a long time since I've had the other Delirium beers and I think it might be a little longer."
"D: A+ I found this beer very easy to drink. It is not heavy on the carbonation and it is smooth all the way down."
"D- Very smooth and drinkable for such a high ABV, but the sourness does hurt the overall drinkability a bit. Overall a decent brew, but not one that I will be spending four dollars a bottle on again any time soon."
"Overall: A strong and interesting Belgian. Not as strong (in overall character) as the other Delirium offerings, but not bad in all."
"D: Very potent, but very drinkable."
"Great example of the style. Very complex, yet well balanced and drinkable."
"For 10% ABV, this is incredibly drinkable, so beware. I'm very impressed with Noel, and will keep my eyes open for it from now on. Excellent beer."
"Had on tap at the Brick Store Pub in the appropriate glasswaree, of course. This is one of those breweries that I've kinda outgrown. Theire stuff is pretty good, but not great, but I used to think it much better a decade ago. Quite simply these are simple interpretations of Belgian styles and perhaps very good introductions for people weening opening theeirr eyes to the wider world of beer out there. Pours amber with a good head and decent lacing. Smells lightly grainy, slightly sour, with some sweetness and a touch of banana. The taste is light, herbal, honeyed, spiced and even a bit silky in the mouth, but nothing all that complex going on here. Light and grainy in the mouth. Not my favorite with so many other great Belgian options out there."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability: As mentioned before the alcohol warms as it goes down. This beer is higher in carbonation and lighter in body than I expected, finish is dry. This is one that is definitely a sipper. I'll probably buy it next year around the holidays and drink it on Christmas eve for gimmicks, I'll wear a santa hat just like the little pink elephant...Overall this is a decent beer, awesome in appearance and aroma, but that just led me to a let down in flavor-which effected mouthfeel (too much alcohol in my opinion)-which in turn effected the drinkabilty for me."
"Ahh, a clear orangey bronze fills my glass with a big frothy, creamy, head the off-white color of a peeled apple. The nose is sugary sweet with sour fruits. A real caramel apple smell along with belgian yeast, clove, bubble gum, and spice. Very nice. A lush and creamily carbonated light-medium body has just a little bit of light, dry, Belgian candi sugar sweetness. Bushel's of lightly tart fruit load the palate: apples, white grapes, and apricots all come through. Belgian yeast and a mild spiciness slide over the back of the tongue but don't linger. A hint of warming alcohol is faintly detectable on the way down, but not unpleasant in the least. I am just getting in to Belgian beer and it's depth and complexity never ceases to amaze me. This one is really good."
"Drinkability - Interesting beer in a style I need to become more familiar with. Christmas label is confusing to me, but fun. Drinking this feels like an event."
"Still, super drinkable for 10% and worth trying if you're into spice and dark Belgians."
"Rusty brown appearance. Thick white head with lots of lacing. Smells of spicy yeast, pears, apples, and carmel. Tastes as it smells but with a hint of clove and has a slightly roasty flavor to it. Some alcohol warming was detected. Mouth feel is creamy and slightly thick. Overall, drinkability is great for this cold weather. A must try seasonal!"
"I don't particularly care for Delirium Tremens, so I wasn't sure if I would enjoy this beer. I'm so glad I tried it, it's definitely my favorite seasonal brew, and perhaps my all around favorite. It's not as heavy as the other Delirium varieties and has a really smooth taste. It's a fantastic beer to sip, I wish I'd bought more bottles during the holidays."
"I popped the cork on this 750mL tonight, a few weeks late for x-mas, and poured into chalices. The beer was hazy pale brown colored, riding the line between pale ale and dark ale. The aroma was not what I expected, I'd hoped for something along the lines of the other Deliriums (Tremens, Nocturnum) but this was in fact sour smelling like a Flanders Red. There was sour apple or cranberry involved in the smell and the taste, with some nice sweet malt left-overs in the after-taste. Overall OK, definitely not bad per se, but not my favorite from Brouwerij Huyghe."
"At 10% alcohol this one could quickly get you into trouble. Very enjoyable and the best Christmas beer I have had yet this season."
"Deep mahogany body with a reddish orange tint topped by a creamy, fluffy head. Aroma is heavy on fruit aromas, mostly dark cherry, complemented by vanilla and caramel. Really nice surprise. Flavor also follows the berry/fruit theme with decent caramel malt and a hint of vanilla creme soda in there as well. Really complex and enjoyable as a winter beer. Mouthfeel is also really robust, drinkability is great. this may be one of my favorite Belgian offerings."
"Perhaps a bit sweet and simple, but still a very good beer. Perfect for cold winter nights."
"Pours a orange-ish copper color with a small white head. In the aroma, alcohol, cherry and caramel and somewhat like sweedish fish. In the taste, cherry and a small hint of caramel, sweet to dry. A small alcohol burn, smooth mouthfeel and a clean cherry and small alcohol presence in the aftertaste. Ages very well, nice cherry presence and small hints of smooth alcohol."
"Pretty good overall, the coriander is faint, but since that is one of my least favorite flavors in beer, I have a bias against this one. It is a decent beer, tho."
"D: This is a wonderful seasonal brew. It has a sweet and spicy flavor a robust ABV and zesty clean mouthfeel. I could drink this long into the night."
"This is a tasty and enjoyable beer. Great holiday beer, although one that should be enjoyed slowly due to the hefty abv."
"Medium body, with adequate carbonation. Warming alcohol presence, but still does not seem to be as big as it really is. Pretty nice."
"I had this seasonal brew from Delirium at a bar in Connecticut last week. It was served in a 12oz serving. Since, it was listed on their recommend list on the chalk board, I decided to have one. It had been quite a bit of time, since I drank anything from Delirium. It had a decent head, and smelled good. The taste was nutty and spicy. It went well with my food, and was a good choice for a beer this time of the year."
"M/D: Body is a little thin, could use a bump up on the carbonation to try and bolster the body a bit. Drinkability is fine, but not that great, it's just not something I would want to reach for when deciding on a Christmas ale, especially one from Belgium."
"Side Note: I dislike the way that the Delirum bottles are meant to look ceramic, but in reality, are brown glass covered by a plastic layer of ceramic-looking film. Brouwerij Huyghe, either make the bottles ceramic or not, but don't try to front. We aren't fooled. And it makes us feel like we're spending extra money for your bottles to look different. Get over it."
"Label was numerated/coded 1-10 and the 3 & 7 were clipped. I don't speak Pink Elephant (yet) so not sure the date."
"Great bottle art and this thing hides the alcohol well what more could ask for in a Christmas offering"
"drinkability is good. the high alcohol and mild CO2 levels make this one a bit less drinkable, but the exceptional balance and profile make it one to remember. cheers!"
"This is very nice though I'm having trouble distinguishing it from the other Delirium beers. Especially as to what makes it a Christmas ale."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied and slightly chewy. Drinkability is decent, even if the sweetness is somewhat over the top."
"I will get more of this, and I suggest it if you enjoy Belgian beer."
"It makes me wonder what would happen if you poured a little woodchuck into a lighter Belgian strong ale."
"poured this treat into a chalice and it had a beautiful ruby red hue to it, really unique and pretty. had a decent sized head that slowly subsides. the smell is good, apples, and yeast are the most prominent scents. the taste is awesome, completely awesome, warm alcohol on the tounge along with a cidery main flavor with yeast and malt at the end, spectacular taste. mouthfeel is full and wonderful. drinkability is good, but at 10% its kinda strong"
"D- This is a big and rich Belgian Christmas Ale that reminds me a lot of Corsendonk. The alcohol is somewhat hidden and this is a drinkable treat-but a little bit to rich for me. I may buy this one again next Christmas."
"D: Tasty, goes down ok, slightly filling, strong kick, decent representation of style, despite the uniqueness I found in this beer, I consider it to be just an all right beer. Given the array of choices for Belgian beers, I probably wouldnt drink this one again."
"Pours cloudy dark bronze, with a head of large bubbles that fades very fast. Aroma is big alcohol upfront, with dark fruits and some candi sugar and malt backing it up. Body is suitable medium to thin for a Belgian beer. Flavor is very fruity, sweet malt, with some balancing hops, an d a bit of sharpness from the alcohol. Finish is sweet but not heavy or cloying."
"D: Gimme another!"
"Poured the color of unfiltered, unpasteurized apple cider (reddish-brown in appearance). Luscious foamy head dissipated into a thin skim with belgian ringlets and generous fine lacing that adhered to the glass throughout the tasting. Smell of yeast and dark fruit (plum, raisins, cherries). Taste similar to nose. Mouthfeel was a little too lively as a result of the carbonation, which detracted from the flavor. Very crisp, tart finish with the flavor of fermented fruit lingering in the mouth. Very pleasant seasonal."
"Aroma is strong, malty, with plenty of spice hints and even a bit of an odd, rubbery odor that still was not unappetizing. It pours out a dark amber-brown, almost the color of cola with a decent head. Flavor is strong and mouth-filling, malty and quite spicy, with a touch of hops. This ale is quite smooth but has a good bite to it."
"I am not sure if I would consider this very seasonal. There is plenty of spice, but they do not strike me as being particularly holiday themed. Maybe the color threw me. I was expecting something something more brooding. In any case the beer is very flavorful and quite digestable. Recommended."
"a hard drinker at 10% abv, this one hits fast too."
"Drinkability - this is a good ale, but it is not one that I'd go out of my way for, but it is good nonetheless. And of course, its high abv naturally limits sessionability."
"Bought a 2007 750 to celebrate the completion of the semester. Cork popped with a good bit of force and I poured it into a Duvel glass. Pours a transparent orangish-brownish-ruby color that when held to the light was really very pretty. Off-white fluffy head took a while to settle down to a solid film that left a great deal of lacing. The smell is sweet fruit, plum, and candy sugar. The taste is good but a little disappointing when judged against other belgian strong dark ales. Its a little too light and fruity as opposed to the rich and deep flavours I have come to expect from this style. That being said it is well balanced and very drinkable with the alcohol content well hidden. The mouthfeel is velvety and the beer goes down with dangerous ease. I would certainly partake again."
"A sort of hybrid between the Tremens and Nocturnum, this is by far my favourite of the Delirium trio. At nearly two years this is drinking wonderfully. I'm curious now to try it at different ages. I hope to find this in my stocking every year."
"I'd recommend this beer, despite its challenges."
"D- Very nicely balanced winter ale full of seasonal fruits and spices, alcohol is well-masked for a strong ale"
"All in all a good beer, but not special enough for the price. Good flavour, but I wanted more complexity. I'll stick to Chimay if I want to splurge."
"This beer poured a nice amber color with a fluffy off white head which disappeared quickly. The smell was okay. I could smell a hint of cloves and banana. The taste was disappointing, The first thing I could taste was metal and that was it. I let the beer warm up a bit and the metal taste went away and then I could taste bananas and yeast. No hops at all. The mouthfeel was medium body with medium carbonation. The overall drinkability of this beer for me was poor. I expect more from this company and for $8 a bottle I was disappointed."
"deep amber with ruby highlights. fluffy light tan head that had okay retention and okay lace. looks didn't impress me too much, but weren't bad. nose was very nice. it got more medicinal as it warmed, but the banana, tropical fruit and candi sugar scents were great. spicy yeasty smell as well. Tastes was similar, but i wished that the booze and medicinal/herbal/spicy taste didn't play such a prominent role. i really liked it nonetheless. nice medium-full body with a slightly bitter finish. i found the beer enjoyable for sure, and even better when enjoyed with some homemade chocolates and rum cake that my friend brought to share with this one. not my favorite brewery, but most likely my favorite beer from them."
"I've had this beer every winter since I moved to Boise, but I DO NOT remember liking it this much... Tonight, my initial impression of this beer was WOW! Big and up front. I don't know how this will cellar, but I am going to give it a try for a 4-pack... After a little while longer, I think this will keep nicely and really get a chance for everything to come together."
"D: Had this on the winter beer tour at Old Chicago and year after year its a favorite. Nice balance of fruit and malt. This one makes Belgium proud and takes my back to my Christmas spent over there several years ago. I love it."
"Served on draft at the Bavarian Lodge in Lisle, IL, in the proper Delirium snifter, pink elephants and everything. Cool, huh? A slightly cloudy dark amber color with a solid head that dissipates into a ring around the sides, leaving a little lace along the way. Great Belgian aromas of solid malt with an aromatic cornucopia of fruit, mostly peach/plum varieties, plus a little bit of nutmeg and clove spice notes. Smooth, sweet malt body with just enough of a hint of hop bitterness to keep it from becoming cloying. Fruity flavors still present, and the spices dance in the distance. You know they're there, but you really can't name them. All in all a very nice holiday brew that goes down as well as any high ABV Belgian brew. The ABV is very well hidden, so it's easy for gravity to warp while you're on the barstool."
"Mostly clear, darkish amber body with ruby highlights and a finger of gauzy, lacy, light khaki head. Tropical fruit malt aromas mix with toasted caramel, bubblegum booze, and holiday spices. Very heady aromas are nice and complex. Sugary malt: tropical fruits and candy sugar. Caramel and figs mix with spices: big anise and licorice. Warming, boozy finish remains sweet. Not bad. Full-bodied with a syrupy, almost cloying feel. A little strong on the anise (for me), but a nice holiday ale."
"Drinkable as can be for half the weight of a cordial. Great with warm, savoury winter food like macaroni and cheese and sausages!"
"A 750ml bottle with 2.006 stamped on the cork. It was a red/orange color with a very small head. Fairly still. Fruity aroma, raisins mostly, with a little bit of spice. Pleasant fruity taste, again the mild spiciness, and a hint of licorice at the end. Nice beer, easy to drink."
"D: Just about non-existant alcohol presence makes this one dangerously drinkable."
"D--eh, not that great. worth a try I suppose...the corsendonk was superior."
"D- Very drinkable brew. You cannot tell how much alcohol this one has in it. Very well hidden. I really like this one!"
"Perfect Belgium yeast candy cane, molasses, nutmeg and winter spices in the aroma, and quaff. This is one spicy brew, black pepper seemed to make its way to the top too. This babe starts sweet, and then finishes on the hot side. The alcohol seeps into the finish, but not strong enough to negatively influence this fine brew."
"D - This is a very good beer. Great malt flavor and subtle spiciness."
"D - A warming sweet but smooth, boozy Holiday ale with spicy yeast and fruity esters. One to be reckoned with since it's balance makes it easy to forget the 10% potency it possesses."
"Especially easy to drink the only words to describe this is just damn good."
"Highly recommended, just not to everyone. The more unexpected the flavor is, I'm afraid the less likely it is to agree with you."
"The drinkability is terrific considering the ABV. This beer is extremely similar to Delirium Tremens, only darker, maltier, more complex and better in every conceivable way. I don't understand why it's not getting more love on here..."
"Nice smooth, full mouthfeel with a crisp and clean finish...the more I drank, the better it tasted...very nice Belgian!"
"Thin and slick. Lightly carbonated, but not under-carbonated. Finishes relatively crisply. Fairly easy drinking for the ABV, but not as deceiving as could be."
"A romantic cloudy and deep warm brown color with a beautiful light off white head. While the head does not stand long the light effervescent clings to the glass.Quite a bit of carbonation but not as much as sister Delirium. Aromas of malt are masked by an under layment of caramel and spices. Nice finish and while similar to a variety of Belgium Ales it is a nice seasonsonal surprise and more"
"Alcohol is a little too pervasive. I know it is ten percent but Belgians usually do a finer job of masking it. It is winter now and cold as bizarro hell right outside, so I welcome the alcohol."
"There are better beers, but this is a nice one to have on occasion."
"Smokey and creamy. Bitter fruits give way to a dry finish. Spicing is lighter than expected... subtle and complementary."
"Taste is sweet candy sugar, with some estery notes which remind me of chewing gum. In the middle there is some spiciness like nutmeg. Aftertaste is dry and spicy. Body is thin, too thin for my liking, it tears apart the balance of the beer and make all the nice spiciness and candysugar appear to be less intense. I have seen this with other Christmas beer where there is just too much sugar in it."
"Very drinkable for a 10%... it's a bit hot, but still, pretty nice. Most of that odd metallic flavour was gone by the time I got through the bottle. All in all, is it something I would purchase again? Sure, why not... but I doubt I would seek it out. Still, another solid offering by a fantastic brewery."
"Drinkability is actually quite good considering how well hidden the alcohol content is."
"D - Not as I expected...I'd like to try another and enjoy it over the course of 30 minutes to an hour to see if anything changes...maybe I didn't get the full effect. I'm very thankful to Phatz for giving me the chance to try this, and I do look forward to sampling another...if the taste doesn't change from an intense spicy-ness to a more rounded Belgian Strong Dark Ale, then I won't consider it to be too drinkable."
"Cheers!"
"This beer poured a very reddish amber color with a nice head that slowly became nothing more than a tiny little lace around the glass with good retention. The smelled sweet and had a bold fruitiness to it. Predominatly malty notes than anything hoppy. It had a nice bold strong taste with alcohol present in every sip. A nice slick slightly fizzy mouthfeel with a very ncie alcohol kick on the way down. Perhaps I should age it this one next time as the alcohol seemed to overwhelm the other flavors and scents."
"Pours an opaque reddish brown with a thick medium-density off-white head. Smells of candi sugar, cinnamon, and peppermint. Tastes entirely different. Dark malt, dry fruit. Prunes, raisins, and nutmeg. The alcohol comes on in the finish. The mouthfeel is carbonated and oily. Nice. Drinkability? mmmm... Dangerous in a ten percenter. Sneaks up on you like a naughty Santa."
"From a 750 into a pint glass, pours with a thick uneven head that quickly fell, clinging to the sides of the glass. Smells sweet and spicy, notes of caramel and evergreen (or is that the label swaying my nose?) . Tastes rich and complex, something spray and yeasty in the background. The alcohol comes through before the end, 50 it's hard to nail. Finishes Spicy with some carbonation coming back, but the sweet is Still under it. I could sip on this all night, if I could resist the temptation to drink too much. Very good stuff."
"Pours with a two-finger creamy head that goes very slowly and leaves a good lace. Medium carbonation and medium bodied. Clear amber color. Nose is prunes and alcohol. Starts sweet becomes spicy, prickly finish. Alcohol aftertaste. $8.99 for 750ml bottle from Tulley's Beer and Wine Wells, Me."
"Delirium Noel, while not quite the equal of Delirium Tremens, is a tremendous beer in its own right. Even if it doesn't fit easily into any one particular style, it delivers the goods like the Jolly Old Elf himself. I wish that I had had the opportunity to enjoy this bottle on December 25th. I'll be sure to keep that in mind for next year."
"Overall: An excellent brew to celebrate the holidays with.Once a year is good enough for me though."
"I've been waiting to try this one for some time now and it was well worththe wait! I could smell it's fruity aroma as soon as I opened the bottle, it has a nice dark cloudy amber color to it that is topped with a nice thick head. It goes down very smooth and just warms up your mouth, and you can really taste the spices in it."
"2004 bottle. I was worried that the cork had gone bad since there were dried brown drops runnig down the neck. Cork released with a reassuring pop. Light brown head that fully vanished. Hazy and murky, dark amber. Heavy yeast, but also some barnyard and mold aromas. This is a bit skunked, me thinks. There was still some good carbonation. Could taste some dried fruit. I guess this one is best drunk fresh. It was properly stored since I bought it in 2004."
"A great tasting Belgan ale. Pours a deep mahogany red color. Nice size off white head and good lacing on the glass. Good aroma, fruitinesss and astringent. Tastes great. The 10 percent abv is completely hidden. Taste is astringent, cherries and slightly malty. Mouhfeel is incredibly rich. Drinkability is good for a high abv beer, This is one to savor. Not as much ""in your face"" taste as some other Belgian ales."
"D: I love delirium brews, but this one was a tad on the thin side, mouthfeel wise. Tastes were there, making it a nice holiday/winter brew to drink. Not a sipping brew--it's easily drinkable and goes down smoothly."
"Drinkability is below average. The flavors of this beer are really confusing with an over-stated oak flavor. I can't imagine purchasing this again."
"750ml cork & caged painted white bottle with no freshness date other than 2005 on the cork. Pours a cloudy medium amber with a two finger head, decent longevity and decent lace. Lots of good malty smells mixed with brown sugar, dried dark fruits, sherry and yeast. Slight notes of banana and clove. Lotsof good smells but fairly average as the style goes. Flavors are not nearly as strong as the aroma whould lead you to believe. They same flavors are there although mixed with a fair amount of hop bitterness - that quickly fades. Not a great deal of carbonation. Fairly easy drinking as the style goes - although some may consider it watery. A decent beer but not a great one."
"Not enjoyable as expected. Tastes like a good beer with a shot each of booze and Listerine added. This beer wants to be good, it just isn't."
"D= depending on how much 10%ABV you can tolerate, you might really like to session on this, especially during a cold winter or holidays."
"this thing is all kinds of spicy. some aging would behoove to mellow out the sharp spiciness"
"This is a solid Belgian Christmas offering."
"All in all, a good Belgian ale. Not what I would normally expect from a winter ale; whether that is good or bad is up to you. I could personally see this as being a year-round release as there was nothing ""Christmas"" about it that I could tell."
"Thanks, beerhandy, for the opportunity"
"Not back, packed with fruit flavors and a toasty maltiness that is common with the Delirium line. Recommended."
"Appearance was reddish, slightly caramel colored. Head was off-white, sort of an eggshell tint. Smell was smoky, peppery, with just the slightest hint of sweetness. Taste was very smoky, it left me with a strong impression of oak. Hints of coffee, cocoa, and a very slight sweetness, but I noticed these almost as afterthoughts. Mouthfeel was smooth, almost velvety. Personally, I found the strong smoky flavor almost overpowering, which really hurt the drinkability for me. Overall, not a bad beer, but I was left feeling let down after my amazing experience with Delirium Tremens. Still, I'd recommend it."
"Poured a very red red hue. I asked for an xmas brew at the liars club and was presented with this. this tasted of candy sugar and cherries. A strong cherry taste dominated this brew and it was way too sweet for me. Cloyingly sweet wouyld be an apt description. i will not be having this again. it was obvious some care went into this brew but the outcome was not for me."
"750 ml. bottle- color of amber , small stark white large bubble head - nose of prunes , yeast , molasses , dark fruit , mocha , malt , and spicy  taste of red fruit , tawny port , red wine , milk chocolate - body is low in carbonated , and creamy  aftertaste is slightly acidic Citrus (mostly orange) and red fruit"
"Drank okay for the abv, this didn't really get me too excited, but a a solid warmer upper for sure"
"Reddish brown fairly translucent body with ruby-red highlights and about an inch of off-white head. Smells like citrus and grape with just a hint of banana. Tastes like citrus, apple, and grape, with hints of what tastes like banana. Fairly crisp and dry on the finish with a little alcohol flavor and warming. On the lighter side of medium-bodied. Pleasant, but not sure something I'd get again. There are beers that are cheeper and just as good."
"I had this next to a 1 year aged St. Feullien Noel and it was there was no comparison. While this is a decent brew, there are some better choices out there."
"This definitely makes me feel festive for the holidays!!"
"D - An excellent beer for the Christmas season. I like this quite a bit better than Delerium Tremens, and I will certainly buy this again next winter. Next time I'm getting the big bomber though."
"Pours a half-clear, caramel brown with a dense off white head that leaves some nice lacing on the sides of my Duvel glass. Aromas are fruity and phenolic, reminiscent of some abbey brown ales. Pears, a bit of white grapes, and some solvent grain alcohol underneath. A touch of sweetness initially on the palate, but that fades quickly to a well-balanced sweet/dry combination. Sharp, prickly carbonation on the sides of the tongue, along with some acidity, with apple esters and some phenols coming out in the mid-palate. Mouthfeel is lighter than I expected, with effective carbonation and some nice acidity that would aid in pairing with food. This is quite a nice beer, with the fruity esters, acidity, and sweet malts playing very well together. I imagine this would be excellent with holiday meals featuring rich, sweet meats and such."
"Served on draft in a Delirium snifter (unfortunately, not the Noel version with the little Santas). The appearance is a ruby color with a nice creamy head and fair amount of carbonation - very enticing. The aroma of this beer is absolutely fantastic, sweet, cidery and grape like, it bore a strong resemblance to Rodenbach Grand Cru, although not as intense. I couldn't get enough of the smell, and the active carbonation maintained the aroma to the last sip. The taste was incredibly smooth, slightly tart with traces of fruit and sweet malt, but much less flavor then the aroma might indicate. However, when a beer is as well executed as this, I find it difficult to pinpoint dominant flavors, but each one I tasted was more enjoyable then the last. The mouthfeel was very nice, a perfect amount of carbonation to balance the richness, although at 10%, this was not nearly as syrupy as lesser made strong ales. The complexity of taste and perfectly balanced body really hide the high alcohol content, which combined with the wonderful aroma make this winter warmer dangerously drinkable! After tasting so many other holiday beers that are overwhelmed by a particular spice or flavor, it's the balance of this one that really makes stands out."
"A difficult beer to score, as it's pretty good in all categories, but slightly disappointing in that it's not great in any category. Surprisingly drinkable for a 10% holiday beer. I'd order it again, but not before I tasted most of the other fun, big beers a place had to offer."
"Notes, 12-26-08: 2 years later and I had this one for Christmas. Reviewed it without looking at the old review and my opinion hasn't changed, with one exception: second time around I would've lowered the score of the nose to 4.0, as I think it's too sugar-centric. But the general descriptions are the same, as well as the overall impression that there's a lot of candied sugar and fruit in this one, though with a semi-dry bitterness at the finish."
"Overall, this is an extremely well made beer. I wouldn't expect any different from this brewery. Outstanding job, and well worth seeking out, whether in bottle or on tap. You may find other Christmas beers that are more interesting to you, be it due to spicing, hop selection, etc. But you'll likely not find many made better than this, when all is said and done. Good job."
"A solid ale. Nothing really jumps out at me apart from the nice balance between its various flavors. A highly enjoyable sipping brew."
"Pours a clear amber with little to no carbonation but still produced a great thick tan head with dense bubbles. Aroma was overpowered by the yeast. I was a bit disappointed because none of the spice could make it through the bready yeast aromas leaving the smell just like Tremins. Taste was what the nose promised at first, bready yeast, but develops more in the mouth. Great maltiness up front balanced perfectly by hops with hints of clove, fruits and some vanilla. Mouthfeel was smooth. Lighter than I expected and very nicely balanced. Easy to drink for a 10% beer."
"The mouth is"
"D: i JUST looked up at the alcohol percentage. WOW, it sure didn't taste like 10 percent. I could drink this all night long.... And then another when I wake up."
"A nice beer to sip with friends. Though the malty-sweetness was a bit much for me at first, as I mentioned, it rounds out nicely. I like it, but would prefer something with a little bit more spice to it for a winter ale."
"Sweeter, spicier, and and with more even more effervesence than I remembered. But the beer carries a LOT of sediment that causes the beer to look choppey, chunky, and overall unappealing. I'm all for yeast sediment and doesn't allow for a detrement in review, but this is such an affect than it interferes with the taste and mouthfeel."
"D: Promising, except for the oxidized taste. Probably just a bad bottle, so I may try this one again."
"Drinkability: Decently drinkable, but perhaps a bit too fruity for some."
"D: This is one of the sweetest beers on the market. But what's absolutely remarkable is the fact that its not cloying, the drinkability remains very high. Craftsmanship at its finest. I applaud this beer and the brewery."
"-Oelergud"
"Pretty drinkable considering the 10%abv, but the sweetness as well can hold it back. Very good nonetheless."
"Has the recipe changed or did this age well? It's much better than any Delirium noel's I've had in the past."
"A pretty good winter warmer overall, but coming from a brewery that I personally feel is overrated. This is very decent, but it is not noteworthy in any way. For the price, there are a handful of other belgian Noel's that I would rather buy. Is it worth the money? Yes. Is there better out there for the same price range? Absolutely."
"Very nice beer, but far from great."
"well, this is straight from the case that apparantly was just delivered to the store....so i assume this is this year's release. pours red/brown with some floaties in there, nicely carbonated with a big ol foamy head. smells spicey, fruity, plummy, and malty...altogether a promising nose. Taste is...and i can't believe no-one else has said this about this beer (at least on the most recent page)....really, really, smoky. its like they took a nice belgian, spiced it up, and smoked the shit out of it. well, not really that much, but its got a nice hickory smoked taste right up front on the first few sips and then for a long time on the finish. also in there are the plums and spices i got on the nose. yeah, its really just liked a smoked version of tremens. maybe this year they've changed the recipe and added some smoked malts? anyway, its pretty good and certainly interesting."
"Poured from corked and caged ceramic 750 ml bottle with a dark, murky brown appearance. There was a fair amount of carbonation at first which dissipated after a few minutes. Aroma was spicy and fruity with some hints of roasted malts. Taste was quite malty and sweet with some flavors of chocolate, spices, prunes and cherries coming out as the beer warmed. I could also detect a winey note in the finish. Mouthfeel was medium bodied and not too heavy in the palate considering the strength of this beer. Drinkability was good, but watch out as this one can sneak up on you in a hurry. I stood up after finishing the bottle and nearly ended up laying on the living room floor."
"Mouthfeel fair carbonation. Taste: you can tell it's Belgian but the predominant effect is cola/root beer sweetness without a lot of complexity. Didn't enjoy this very much, won't buy it again...I have no idea how old this was or whether I experienced the desired effect...definitely not on par with standard Delirium Tremens which is a good Belgian ale."
"I look forward to Christmas beers all year long, but I wish I hadn't spent the $11 on this one."
"D- something to crack open for some kind of celebratory occasion, I plan to buy more of this beer and stow it away for a special occasion"
"Notes: I love this brewery but this one simply doesn't do it for me. Its an odd mixoligy. This is on the complex side of the house which sometimes is good and sometimes bad. In this case its interesting but doesn't mold together well."
"I bought three bottles, all labeled as Delirium Noel, however one bottle had a different label than they other two. Apart from the picture they appear identical....I'm not extremely familiar with the brand and wonder if perhaps they have changed the label recently and two bottles were of a different year than the other."
"Poured a copper amber color with a fair amount of head. Aroma was an earthy yeast, honey, fruit esters and cotton candy (must be all that sugar). Flavor was very sweet, with no hops to be found. Raisins, grass and bread were apparent and the alcohol was very well hidden, just peeking through at the end. Mouthfeel was slick, with carbonation almost imperceptible. As far as drinkability, it was excellent in taste, but not something you could drink a lot of."
"This is quite a beverage, and I recommend it to anybody who can find it."
"The only problem with the drinkability was it's ABV content, which was hardly noticeable, and the fact that it's a seasonal Christmas beer. Otherwise, the beer is excellent and is something I would most definitely reach for again."
"Mouthfeel is creamy, smooth, full yet light. Almost a well-made whipped cream type feeling. Extremely drinkable- especially considering alcohol content. Tasty, yummy, not too heavy- just a great brew."
"Bottle: Poured a medium amber color ale with a super huge foamy and creamy off-white head with perfect retention. Aroma of cinnamon and another spices which results in a weird perfume that doesnt excite my olfactory sense. Taste is also dominated by that weird perfume that I have a hard time to pinpoint. I also noticed some sweet malt. Body is real creamy with a good lacing. Alcohol is very well hidden. Even though Belgian Christmas beer is not a well-defined style, there are still some things that I expect (high ABV, full body, spice mix) which I couldnt find in here."
"pours out of the 750 ml bottle a clear amber colour, with a thin head that reduced to nothing quickly leaving no head and no lace. aroma is heavily influenced by the malts...but other than some earthiness and brown sugar and faint ripe fruitiness...it's pretty tame. the flavour is all stocky malt, alcohol spice and a welcome woodiness that means business. mouthfeel is is full....body is potent. i was expecting more complexity but the robust nature of this offering is equally compelling. it's dry, woody and delicious and an awesome example of a x-mas time quaffer. it finishes clean and warming. this should sipped by the fire on a cold winter night."
"Bought a big bottle 750 of this on discount! Gotta love a great brew at a REALLY reasonable price. I love the little elephant santa on the bottle! This one poured amber with a pretty creamy head that stayed quite thick. There were nice fruity smells mild bananas a hint of ctirus(!) and some dark plummy scents too. I did not pick up much alcohol in the scent. Surprising as this is a beast of an ale. The taste was unbelievably smooth for the strength of this and mouthfeel and drinkability are much better than I would have thought considering the power and complexity of this ale. Very tasty and a nice special treat during the holidays. I will likely stock up on a case of this to see how well it ages..."
"A fine fine beer. It would be interesting to try this with more age on it."
"the taste and mouthfeel save this one. it does not taste like 10%. definately strong, but so smooth and light as a feather, tap dancing on the tongue, interesting and fun to drink. half-way through the bottle i am feeling it. after the last pour, it takes on a darker, thicker hue, and tastes creamy. quite a difference in mouthfeel, but still wonderful. this is my first delirium, i look forward to trying the rest."
"The aroma announces this brew as distinctly Belgian from the get go, with a fruitiness coupled with mild tart/sour elements. Flavors alternate rapidly and fluidly from spicy, to sweet, to sour, and then bitter. The finish is long and easy. On the whole the easy, refreshing nature of this beer belies its robust alcohol strenght. Highly enjoyable."
"Overall, a fun brew. Fairly simple and easy to drink. I'd definitely recommend it!"
"Wonderful winter brew. I think my bottle could've benefitted from aging. Next time I'll be sure to look for an older bottle. Maybe I'll even pick a fresh one next time I see it, and cellar it for a few years."
"Good mouthfeel, and very, very drinkable for the style. Good stuff, and more impressive then what I've had from this brewery in the past."
"Mouthfeel- Excellent carbonation with some sweet fruit sweetness. Excellent nightcap beer."
"Nose is a nice harmony from anis caramellic malts, cinnamon and clove with nice alcoholic note in there. Taste is spicy, alcoholic and a sour twist. With that good and full caramellic malts. Nice taste but very strong and maybe litle overspiced. Good and moderate carbonisation balanced mouthfeel and taste make this one into a fine brew that I enjoyed."
"Edit--I'm upping the taste to a 4.5. It gains considerable character and complexity as it warms."
"An excellent beer....I think I'll have another."
"Man, they're not kidding about the pink elephants on the label! Packs a punch that sticks with you and grows exponentially for an hour or so after you finish. I knew about the 10% abv before the first sip, but forgot about it soon after because this seasonal is super, super smooth. A most enjoyable pint from the tapper that was velvety and well-balanced all the way through. I recall caramel and mulling spices being the most predominant flavors, with just a hint of apple maybe and a very clean, long finish that leaves you excited for the next sip. It's like a moth to the fire."
"Very, very nice -- a pleasure to pour, to smell and to taste. I've never been disappointed by any of the Delirium offerings, but this, the Noel, may be my favourite."
"750 ml painted (mock stoneware) corked bottle, now available in Norway (despite some objections by the humour & morality police). Amber to brown colour, large off-white head with an orangey hue. Malty sweetish aroma with strong notes of caramel, treacle and Christmas spices, also notes of yeast and oak. Flavour is very spicy and sweet (candy sugar) with a pleasant warming mouthfeel. Theres a hoppy and spicy (and slightly alcoholic) bite in the finish. A demanding beer, but not bad."
"Big 750 mL bottle with 2.005 on the cork. It pours a deep garnet with a 1 finger khaki head. It smells of cinnamon, clove, alcohol, sweetness, and some fruits toward the end. It has a medium to thick body and tastes of cinnamon, sharp cloves, anise, caramel, and hints of other malt flavors. Drinkable, but not that complicated and didn't keep me interested for too long. My second Christmas Belgian and they both tasted about the same."
"Drinkability: Have to take some off for the 10% ABV; that really limits what you can do. Still, tasty and much more musular than the soft aroma would lead you to believe. Very unusual, very good."
"The color is crimson with a huge, light brown head. Retention is solid, with moderately thick, creamy lacings. Aroma is a mixture of citrus and spices, with a vague underlying sweetness. Smell is good, but doesn't stand out from other beers with similar characteristics. The taste is of dark, fruity malt joined by orange peel and spices. Surprisingly, at 10% abv, only a touch of alcohol is noted. Finally, a sip is rounded out by sugariness. This is pretty awesome stuff, and the alcohol is almost too deceptive, this is something I'll pick up again next winter."
"From a growler shared with friends, picked up at the beer store: This one is a beautiful, deep bronze color with a light tan head. The head is appropriately creamy and lace-producing. A fruity, spicy aroma is dominant, mingling with alcohol and esters. Banana, spice, sugar, and (again) a lot of alcohol. The taste is sweet, peppery, and very warming. Theres a hint of a tart-sourness that never fully presents itself. A Medium-low carbonation. Peppery finish. This is one very fully bodied and very enjoyable sipping beer."
"Taste; really nice ripe plums, a good bit of banana flavor stands out along with a bit of sweet caramel maltiness, and some alcohol bite in the finish. It has the nice yeasty and spiced smells that I've come to expect in Belgian style beers. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and smooth, with nice carbonation."
"D: I should note that I have a little bit of a cold, so my taste/smell may not be quite up to par, but this seemed to come through okay. I thought this was going to be richer than it was, but that said, it was a very good beer and I had no problem finishing the bottle. I have a second bottle in my fridge and I look forward to revisiting this in a month or two (or maybe next X-mas)."
"good drinkability an excellent choice for sipping on christmas.."
"Definitely ins to sip and enjoy with friends."
"Finish is dry and clean. Mouthfeel is medium, lighter than would be expected. Faint alcohol presence in the vapors as it's consumed but not really enough to characterize it as a burn. I like the Tremens better, but this one is great in its own right."
"--Joey"
"Large bottle, capped and corked, opened with a fairly mellow amount of energy and the cork says ""2005"" Pours with a moderate tan head, doesnt leave very exciting lacing. Slightly cloudy, dar/medium auburn. The nose is where things get exciting, scotch, dark sugar and mustyness picked up. This is a darkly rich and flavorful elixir. Lots of dark caramel, candi sugar,toasty malts and complex yeast and light holiday spice notes. Subtle smokyness comes foward as it warms. More rum soaked toastyness also becomes evident. Warming and glowing with alcohol. One of my favorite holiday style brews. Superb winter sipper and Christmas dinner night capper. Gotta give em props for a great looking bottle and label art as well!"
"CAVEAT REMINDER: This beer rates so far below other reviews that I believe it is my obligation to re-review another bottle. When I do that, any changes to my review will be added in parenthetical note format to the original review."
"Drinkability: Frankly, this is an ok beer. For a holiday beer I was disappointed. I would have prefered more spicyness. I do not know if this beer would benifit from cellaring. I like the other beers I have had from this brewery"
"I love me a Belgian Strong Dark. Pours a beautiful garnet/amber with a steady stream of bubbles contributing to a steady khaki head. Nose is festive and crisp - with floral hoppiness, caramel malts and spicy Belgian yeast. Taste is predominantly spicy Belgian yeast, cinnamon stick, pine tar, tropical fruit esters and strong caramel malt husk. Mouthfeel is remeniscent of champagne, rich and carbonated. The 10% is certainly present - adding to the winter warm-ness of the brew. A spicy, floral brown Belgian brew. Definitely worth a go. A flavorful winter Belgian no doubt."
"Medium bodied with ample carbonation lending to a light and fluffy mouthfeel."
"This beer came a dark red copper with a small head that quickly faded to a ring around the edge of the glass. Smelled of cherries, raspberries and a slight spicy yeast. Tasted of peaches, raspberries, cherries and a sweet wheat malt. Mouth feel with slightly vicious, yet thin. The fruit complexity of this beer was nicely done with low sugars, and a thinner mouth feel. Also, at 10% abv, this was quite an accomplishment."
"This beer can be classified as a the dom perrione of Pruno!"
"Starts almost sugary sweet, then hits with a blast of spices, finishes slightly dry and yeasty. Spices linger on in the aftertaste with a definite alcohol warmth at the end. Kind of a cross between a Belgian strong dark ale and a winter warmer. A little sweet and spicy for any other time but appropriate for a holiday warmer and the 10% alcohol should help get the party going."
"In my opinion, this is a special winter beer and can't be made to compare with the tremens and nocturnum. They are all good; this is a nice belgian imperial winter warmer- not a true strong dark ale, not a strong pale. Drink it for the season and celebrate winter, don't overthink the comparisons between apples and oranges.."
"I'm glad I tried this one, but at $9 a bottle, I'll probably stick to Delirium Tremens next time I buy one of their products."
"The mouthfeel is a bit astringent and plenty sweet. After warming up to it, it gets better. Not one of the most drinkable beers I've had, but it was a good one to try. Certainly better than the Nocturnum I just had, but I don't quite know whether I like it better than the Tremens."
"Definitely a good winter-warmer, and once again, not disppointed by Delirium."
"Opinion: This is a pretty tasty beer. It is hard to compare it with St Bernardus Abt 12, because it is in the same category. This beer is a lot lighter on the fruit flavors, and adds a lot of spicy complexity. Overall it is a very approachable beer, but it is not one that I would seek out too often."
"The best of the Delirium series."
"On draft, the carbonation level of these beers is hard to get right, which means the head retention is going to suffer a little. In a bottle, it's probably well carbonated. Also, this was a little too cold. When it did warm up, the flavors and aromas came through beautifully. It's a real good holiday beer. Recommended. Oh, by the way, this one will hurt you bad."
"W00T."
"Hippity hoppety."
"A great overall beer. Pours a reddish brown with a medium head. The smell is pleasant like a fruity IPA. The taste is very textured, with a sweet start, then a more deep middle consisting of candied fruit like apricots and plums. The finish is back to the fruity taste that goes down with a lot of sugar. I prefer this to the Nocturnum for sure, but its on par with the Tremends."
"I could drink this again."
"This a very pretty beer that pours an almost dark purple. The smell is fruity and alcoholic with wonderful spices. The flavor is much fruitier than expected. The complexity is wonderful, and aftertaste lingers on so wonderfully. The mouthfeel was a bit thin for the style. The only thing that brought the dirnkability down was the fact that the spiciness gave me a little heartburn."
"Mouthfeel is crisp and has a dry finish. Nicely drinkable, very enjoyable. A winter brew I'll pick up every year.."
"I couldn't bring myself to finish even one glass from the bottle. It just wasn't good. Completely raw, rough, and unrefined. Maybe it needs more age? A LOT more age."
"Beer is good. Happy beering."
"Not a pleasant Christmas day treat."
"The beer pours a deep dark brown color with a thick frothy offwhite head that quickly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a nice malty scent that boasts of pale and Belgian crystal malts. It also has a very tart, yeasty aroma that seems a bit dry. The taste is great. It has a nice, smooth malty flavor that goes down easy and refreshes on the finish. It's not at all dry, but does has a lingering alcohol aftertaste. The mouthfeel is good. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a fine noel. It has great aroma and taste; an excellent sessions brew."
"I love the West Lafayette Village Bottle Shoppe. Picked this one up for about 8 bucks there. Poured into my Gulden draak tulip, it produced a wicked 3 finger wispy white head atop a supremely dark orange / light brown color. Smell has a lot of roasted notes with a subtle fruityness surrounded by a gentle spice. Taste starts off malty but gently fades into a spicy orange peel a la trois pistole. Nice sipper. Mouthfeel is nice and full. Drinkability is decent for a brew of this strength. Will purchase again next year."
"We closed out Christmas with thisone since Santa's flying off. We listened to some christmas tunes one last time and took down all the stuff!"
"I hated the DT i drank earlier this year. Having had this from Huyghe, I think i'll give it another try, on the notion that my bottle was off."
"Nearly perfect! A very nice Holiday treat."
"Drinkability- Again, my trip to the Toronado today was worth every penny. Three great beers and one good one. This one was the best of the four or damn close to it."
"($7.19 / 750 ml / 25.6 oz corked and caged white ""ceramic"" champagne style bottle with red foil)"
"2004 Bottle: This beer is a hazy brown color with a foamy thick beige head with decent retention. Nice lacing. Aroma of yeast, apples and malt. Medium-bodied and spicy, with fruit, yeast and hops flavors as well as a light malt balance. The alcohol is not overly noticeable but I was definitely feeling it after this large bottle. The finish is tart and lasting. Very enjoyable overall."
"On-tap poured into a pint glass (yes, I know, but they were out of the Delirium tulip glass, so I got more for the same price anyway). It pours a hazy medium copper color with two fingers of head. There is a little bit of lacing left on the glass. The smell is light and fruity. Caramel aromas with some light sweet cherry and citrus. The taste is also fruity, with some more cherry and a hint of pineapple juice. There's even a touch of brown sugar and hops. The mouthfeel is fairly thick and smooth. The drinkability is good for a 10% brew. A nice holiday selection."
"The smell was extremely strong and very enticing, seemingly composed of a nice mix of fruit. The taste follows that up with a hefty dose of fruit surrounded by malts and candy. The flavors don't come in complex layers, but what is there sure is good."
"Beautiful amber and semi-unclear, with a thick creamy head that settled as a nice thick layer. Nice gueuze scent to it. Very nice soured, aged, lightly wine cellery scent. Very smooth and creamy mouthfeel. There is a good amount of carbination, but you dont feel it swirling around and foaming, you just notice it sitting on your tongue after a moment, but it is not too much. Very nice. Tastes of sherry and port. You can really tast the alcohol. Caramelly, maple sweetness, bit of sea water, bit of dark fruits. Granny smith apple, maybe a bit of raisin. Good flavors. The 10% may keep it from being a session, but it has such nice flavors and does feel so damn good. Very enjoyable."
"A dissapointing beer concitering the good reputation of the brand. It poured a nice amber color with a small head that had faded once it got to the table and settled into a froth. The smell was of light pepper and clove. The taste was quite subtle for a beer of this size, and had a bit of a thin mouthfeel. The flavor was nice enough but seemed like it was holding back a bit with just a bit of belgian yeast and pepper flavor shining through. I think I'll pass on this one next time."
"excellent"
"had this a month or so ago in a 750ml bottle from a local pub, and it was labelled ""Noel"". to me, it tasted slightly different, or maybe because that night it was my first beer. would like to know the difference (perhaps its just a labelling issue?) either way, im recommending this beer as perfect for pink elephant fans around the holidays."
"Off tap poured into a Delirium Noel snifter. The beer poured a slightly amber golden color with one finger of head. The nose was nice and sweet and fruity, maybe some strawberry and a hint of peppery spice from the yeast. The flavor was good. Some fruity tones and caramel sweetness with a nice spicey finish. Good beer. The feel was thick and creamy and just good. This beer was nice to sit down to after finishing grading finals and collections and all that comes with beig a TA. What a nice beer. I like it better off tap than the bottle."
"I really enjoy Belgian beers and this beer is one reason why. They are so distinctive, rich, multi-dimensional, and wonderful to drink. This Noel is like a a great yuletide milkshake. Ho Ho Ho and all that stuff."
"Quite tasty, easy to handle, even at 10.0%. Flavor is definately there, but it a bit rough in some spots. Spiciness seems to be less of a character boost and more of a character flaw further in. 1 bottle definately enough, once a year, sure."
"This was pretty similar to the Nocturnum, as far as I can tell. Sweet, but fairly well balanced. Plenty of ABV (although not noticed much in the taste). This is a good, dark Belgian, fairly complex and certainly warming. The Delerium beers are a notch below the best Belgians, but always good."
"Taste is of those tart spiced apples again. Cloves and cinnamon. Somewhat yeasty and spicy. Sticky sweet, dare I use the dreaded ""cloyingly""? A bit too sweet which cuts down quite a bit on the drinkability for me. But not a bad beer to sip on for an hour or so. Very thick and chewy. Good thing it's a seasonal, once a year will suffice for me."
"Very, very nice offering from the pink elephant folks."
"A thin head, but overall a very solid appearance, almost a little golden. Aromas in the brandy snifter were especially pronounced, detected a little spiciness. A slightly complex taste, slightly tart but aided by the spices in the brew. Due to the high abv, not something you'd want to take too fast, yet still drinkable."
"This was my first time trying Delirium Noel, had it on tap last evening while at Mahars. It was poured to a clear brown color with red highlights with a nice off white head that broke down and left nice lacing through out the brew. The nose of the brew was highlighted by a spiciness with cinnamon, fruit, alcohol and malt all coming together to give off a nice aroma. The taste was very smooth, sweet tastes of candies up front with spices all balanced with a nice malt backbone. Gave a nice warming sensation, good on a cool night! Can also notice a slight alcohol taste but being that this brew is 10% it is not over the top and goes well with the other flavor although I think I can only have one of these per session. This was a beer that I was not going to try, as I have not been a huge fan of Belgium brews although I think this is changing! If you get the opportunity give it a try."
"This beer poured a murky medium amber color and formed a small off white bubbly head that disappeared quickly and left circular lace. Some sediment was present. An aroma of yeast, malt, spices and honey. A flavor of malt, caramel, spices and some bread aspects. The body was slightly creamy with the finish of it being slightly sweet. Considering the alcohol level, it is hidden quite well."
"Dark reddish-copper in color. Billowing off-white head fills up the goblet. Some lacing. Aromas are all infused with a strong sense of alcohol: cherry candy, sweet caramel, some chocolate. Flavor...hmmph. Flavor is a boxing match of the aromas trying to gain your attention. Not quite unbalanced, but close. Finishes with a hot alcohol infusion. I'd expected some sort of spicy character to this one, but didn't taste it. Surprisingly thin mouthfeel. Not for the timid."
"Poured a cloudy rusty reddish brown. A bit darker than I would have thought it to be. Off-white head dissipated quickly, but still laced the sides of the glass nicely. Just like the review next to mine, I too smelled cherry pie, and there is clearly no question that this is high in alcohol content. I liked the smell, it was just that you could plainly tell that there is alot of alcohol present here. The taste was quite malty with a very slight banana tone hidden in the finish. Truthfully, it seems the alcohol concealed most of what potential flavour profile was there. I like this one, it's just heavy on the alcohol and one should know that up front, lest they be quite dissappointed. The mouthfeel was quite nice in that it wasn't too heavy or too light, and the carbonation level was right where I like it to be for this style. Drinkability? This is a really big brew. One 75cL bottle is fine. Perhaps if there were a span of 3 or 4 hours (at least) I might be able to drink 2 of these. Overall, I think I really like this one."
"Clear dark amber body, frothy head, nice carbonation. Smells sweet and a little fruity. A little roasted malt, and caramel. Tastes a little sweet, decent fruit presence. Nice carbonation bite, and a mild roasted malt / caramel aftertase. Nice carboation to the mouthfeel, evaporates nicely off the tongue."
"Slightly hazy medium copper with a vigorous, thick light tan head. Sweet malt, bananas, and candy sugar on the nose. Little bit of spicy tones noticable. Tropical esters fight for control with the malt sweetness. Slight vegetal finish. Dry, but lingering finish. Coating mouthfeel, but not too heavy. A good beer, but the finish is throwing me off. Drinkable, but nothing too special."
"I sampled this beer on vat at Anam Cara as part of the Belgian Beerfest pre-party. The ruby ale was served in a tremens snifter, and wafted an aroma of alcohol, sour cherries, and hints of chocolate. The flavors were strongly dominated by the alcohol, and sour cherry notes. There were hints of chocolate and cream making the drink vaguely reminiscent of those gooey covered cherries that my mother enjoys finding under the tree. It would have been nice if the alcohol and the cherries didn't unite to generate some nightmarish medicinal notes. Unfortunately, the brew wasn't as drinkable as I had hoped. The watery, yet textured body also confused me."
"Nice white 750mL bottle. Appearance is darkish orange, very ncie color actually although the head is limited to an off-white ring. Extremely sweet and phenolic aroma, tons of belgian candi sugar, powder sugar even. It feels very candyish yet has a big yeast backbone though seemingly not adding much to the melting pot. Surprisingly thin body, like thicker sparkling water. Huge sweetness on the tongue in an herbal fashion(clover and the likes). Very warming sensation, spicy alcoholic middle-mouth to finish. Notes of honey, sucre dorge, plums. A bit cloying."
"I have always wanted to try this ever since I first saw it. I came home from work and my wife left for a business trip in Chicago and she had this was waiting for me (what a wonderful woman!). I poped off the cork and there wasn't a huge carbonation buildup. I was thinking that this would be perfectly aged since it was from '01'. The appearance is very nice. It poured a cloudy rust color with a smooth belgian-style head. I drank this in a snifter and the lacing was very nice. The smell was pretty typical of this style. It had heavy malt tones with the alcohol seeping through. The taste was decent, but a little too thick. This one was almost ""chewy"". I was hoping for a little spice kick in this to distinguish it from there other brews, but I didn't get it. There was just not a lot going on with this one. As far as belgian darks go, this was worth a try, but not comparable to the others available. At least the bottle is pretty cool!!!"
"My only detraction here is that the relatively light body of the brew doesn't mesh very well with the huge flavors and big alcohol. Otherwise a great strong dark."
"This beer performs a balancing act between the usual winter/christmas beer flavors and the flavors that characterize the other Delirium beers. Somehow, they manage to make the spicy, gingerbready flavors work in concert with the fruity, floral, sweet taste. It is a beer that is good months, probably years, after it was originally bottled. And let's not forget the 10% abv kick that helps shake off the cold."
"750ml champagne corked bottle under the name ""Delrium Christmas"". Crimson/brown colour. Aroma of cork, rubber and glace cherry, some fairy floss. Pretty sweet, but not as sweet as expected, but, as expected theirs a pretty big shot of alcohol at the end. Palate is a little short and one dimesnional aswell, some spicyness, yeasty. Dissapointing, and a bit ""crude"" as silktork would say. I guess it was kind of what i expected though, typical Huyghe- i.e pretty lame. This stuff ain't cheap either, bloody hell."
"Tough foil to get off the bottle. Cork says 15/03 I assume it is a 2003. Bright deep brown look with a nice large persistant densw pale beige head. Slight detergent/maltysharp smell. Upfront the taste is malty and sweet and then the brew becomes spicy and fruity. Prominent in the spices are corriander and nutmeg with some hints of pineapple and sour pear. Very nice smooth coating mouth. Quite an impressive feel to the brew. Good drinkability."
"and the flavorings they added. The cork also was printed with the year 2001, so it must have been quite old."
"This beer pours a dark tea-like/amber color with a nice tan head. The strong smell of fruit, musty yeast, and spices smell nice but a little lacking in some way. The taste is sweet apples, raisons, spices and a warming alcohol with the musty yeast in the background again. This is a light bodied brew with a sweet spiced finish. This beer drinks down too easy for a beer with this alcohol...might prove dangersous! Op uw gezonheid!"
"2002 - It pours a hazy orange-brown color. The aroma is earthy and yeasty with some oxidized notes. The body is smooth with some cirtus, spicy, and fruity notes. There is also some faint molasses in the finish. Overall it was just okay. Maybe it is better when it is fresh."
"Pretty cool ceramic looking bottle with a red foil top and decorated with pink elephants pulling Santas sleigh. Pours a dark brownish copper color with a tall mountainous light tan head that very slowly dissipates leaving coats of sticky lace on the walls of the glass as it does so. Nose is dark caramel and honey malts blended with some tropical fruit and a bit of bubblegum. Fairly full in body with a slightly chewy texture that envelops the tongue. Taste begins with caramelized malts and a bit of candied sugar followed by some notes of molasses and butterscotch and finally by some peppery and spicy alcohol. A great winter warmer and a very drinkable brew considering the 10% ABV."
"Pours a deep color of red, off white head on top; long lasting and fine lacing. Aroma of plums and dark fruit come to play with spices and a mild musty yeast scent. Taste is smooth and silky to start with the dark fruit, candy, and alcohol then the spice hint of bitterness. For such a strong beer I felt that I could enjoy it all night. Nothing to overpowering here. This beer is Liquid Christmas in a bottle. Enjoy!"
"Drinkability: Oh yeeeaaah!"
"This holiday beer pours a pretty amber-deep copper color that is quite striking in the light. It is topped by a thick tan head. It is well carbonated with bubbles escaping from the bottom of my glass in a frenzied stream. Smells lightly musty with dark fruit overtones that are accompanied by a slightly sharp spicy aroma. Tastes smooth and rich up front. A prickling carbonation coats the tongue as it slides down my throat. Finishes with a musty-yeasty-fusel type character which is a bit sharp. The fruitiness of this beer combines really well with the sweet-caramel-raisin dark malt character. This beer is dominated by the dark fruit character. It has a medium light body, which works well here. There is also some spice notes in this beer that remind me of coriander."
"Pours a clear dark brownish-garnet in color with a creamy light tan head. Aroma consists of sweet fruity overtones, candied sugar, peppery yeast and alcohol. The mouthfeel is medium-bodied, creamy and smooth. Some sweetness upfront that is followed up with spices. Caramel malt and honey flavors near the middle. Alcohol is blended nicely and detected toward the back of the throat and provides a nice warming feeling on the way down. This is the first offering from this brewery that I've tried and so far, I've been impressed."
"A bit more muted than I expected. Alcohol popped up right away with a peppery sharpness, and then a softer, slightly tart caramel wafted in to smooth things out. Some wine-like fruityness toward the finish. Very drinkable, particulary for the high abv. At an annual holiday beer tasting, among the 20 sampled this year, this was a crowd pleaser, even among the non-beer geeks."
"The tiny, tan head disappears leaving a gorgeous, bald, clear garnet beer. Pay no attention to the two spots of lacing left over. Smell is faint. Sweetish, maybe. Peppery in the front with grapes. But it blooms quickly to a thick, caramely sweet middle. Not sweet like the Tremens. The beer finishes dry. Spicy with some nice grains and plenty of alcohol (better hidden than the Nocturnum). This is a very nice, sweet Belgian."
"The best description of the taste of this beer at first is ... eggnog. A beer-version of the classic holiday drink. Yum. It's incredibly thick and hoppy (but not bitter). There's orange and honey and vanilla and raisin and caramel notes. Wow. Amazing. I'll be buying a lot more of this stuff next winter."
"Good drinkability for a 10% abv beer. A real belly warmer."
"Overall one of the better beers I had over the holiday season. Very tasty."
"Gently poured from the lees it's a clear, deep chestnut with an orange cast and brilliant ruby highlights. A full (but not huge) head of creamy, slightly yellowish foam very slowly receeds to a thin cap, holds throughout the entire goblet, and leaves splashes of lace about the glass. A slight mustiness parts readily to reveal a lively, slightly tart and juicy fruitiness (berries, cherries). Some yeastiness develops with notes of sugar candy and bubblegum spice. A delicately toasted and caramel sopped maltiness hovers beneath but never really comes to the surface itself. As it warms, notes of clove and honey become more dominant. Refreshing and enjoyable! The aroma alone is worth the trip! The body is light-medium and it's exceptionally fine, natural carbonation slides across the tongue with just enough of a caress to awaken the tastebuds before fading smoothly away. More caramelization appears in the flavor than the nose suggests, although it remains somewhat sugary and honeyish like cookie-dough. The fruitiness isn't nearly as bold as the aroma suggests, and what remains is more similar to sweetened blackberries. A clear note of alcohol becomes apparent but not distracting. Some mild spice carries through, and a very sublime bitterness helps to anchor it along with its drying alcohol. It finishes fairly short and dry with a delicate note of lingering honey-berry malt and subtle spice in the aftertaste. A most impressive holiday ale, and certainly worth a try!"
"The alcohol was not readily apparent, so this little baby kicked me in the head."
"750ml bottle love the lable very festive.Pours a amber brown with nice tanish head. Very fruity dark belgiam smell, with some spice and yaest coming out. Tastes excites and tickles the tounge, bubbles, malt with fruit (plums raisins bananas nothing really sticks out but great taste) and a touch of hops thrown into the mix. Warms the body and the soul, or could be the alcohol warming me, not strong in taste but kicks in on the way down. Great mouthfeel love the way the bubbles add to the flavor, medium body. If you can't tell I like this beer, best christmas beer I have had as my first year as a BA apprentice. Wish everyone a good Christmas and thanks for expanding my beer knowledge."
"Capital Ale House 10 ounce draft."
"2003 Version on tap at Monk's Cafe in Philly: The color is slightly reddish orange. Slight whiff of alchohol to the nose. A bit of alcohol to the taste, but still a very sweet malt taste. Not what you would expect of a Christmas beer, but very good nonetheless. My overall rating from my 750ml bottle hasn't changed. Perhaps some fruits hiding in there with the malt sweetness to the nose. Very warming."
"Noel came in the beautiful bottle and went up from there. It pours a clear brown color with some amber tinge with a considerable brownish head. The lacing is strong but fades fast. It has a malty, fruity aroma with hints of nutmeg, cinnamon, and clove. It also has the distinct aroma of a strong ale with yeasty undertones. I love the taste of this if its served at about 50 degrees. Once it got really cold in the fridge, it lost a lot of the explosion that I got from the warmer brew. Its taste is malty but with hints of many spices. It fades a little in the mouth for a beer with this alcohol content. It packs a wallop so drinkability is good if shortened."
"Pours a clear brown with copper highlights. Tan head that dissipated and leaves minimal lace. Sugarplum maltiness mixed with spice and a significant alcohol-laden esteriness in the nose. Smells more alcoholy than it tastes. Beautiful, subtle spice and sweet fruity malt kick to it, a nice malt and yeast coalition leaving it dry and fruity in the finish. This beer is a ""sneaker"" if you're not careful. It's that tasty."
"Served on draft at the Map Room, Chicago, bless their hearts. Dark body that glows with brown highlights around the edges. Slightly minty taste like a root beer, then a little bit of fruitiness. Finally resolves to a winey taste at the end. Complex brew that you dont realize is overpowering you until its too late."
"Amongst the most interesting labels I've ever seen, pink elephants with Santa hats pulling a sleigh. The beer is quite interesting as well. Though it's not a world-beater, Noel is certainly a good winter warmer, and a nice treat while getting snowed in."
"Beautiful bottle, but the foil was a pain in the butt. Just didn't want to come of in one piece. Pours with a deep copper color with a head that just doesn't want to go away. Very peppery with a caramel like sweetness. Some tropical fruit thrown in there as well. Christmas is the perfect time of year for this. I wouldn't mind finding a couple of these under the tree."
"A nice beer. I definately enjoyed it!! But, 9 bucks...damn."
"Let's state this at 10% a drinkable Belgian Christmas ale is intimidating, a drinkable Belgian Christmas ale like this ON TAP is just dangerous. Appearance: Ruby copper tone nice full white cream colored head lacing is full and webbed, Christmas is at hand my friends. Aroma: Sweet candied sugar, sugar plums, cinnammon and nutmeg combo dance through the air with each sniff and oh so pleasant pine scented hops. Taste: Full spicy nutmeg, with syrupy layers of pine cone flavored hops loads the palate with an alcohol tinge warming me up for the winter weather. Mouthfeel: Syrupy textured full to medium but each sip is definitely classified as rich, gotta love a winter warmer. Drinkability: This beer is another Belgian Christmas favorite doesn't do what Corsendonk Xmas does for me but this one is still on the lines of downright drinkable and incredible tasting."
"Had this one last night, out of the ceramic style 750ml corked and caged bottle. The red foil wrapping was a pain to peel off, but I liked all the yule themed pink elephants on the label. Pours an almost clear cherry mahogany with a serious off-white head. Chains of lacing prevail down the glass. Nose is fruity banana mango with Belgian malts in evidence. Mouthfeel is light to medium with carbonation evident. Taste is of a fine Belgian strong dark ale that puts the sweet malts to battle. Fruity sweetness seems to dominate the palate, but overall a nice departure from the norm. I like it a lot. Really too sweet, but with the 10% abv it hits the spot for me on a cold night."
"Pours a translucent reddish-brown with a smalll tan head. Smells sweet and malty with all kinds of fruity aromas going on. The various fruit flavors carry over to the taste--plums, raisins, and light citrus. In addition to a symphony of fruit, there is also the trademark coriander and light spiced feel in the mouth that makes for a most interesting seasonal brew. Overall, not the best offering from Huyghe, however it certainly will warm you up nicely on a cool winter evening (note: I live in Florida and it doesn't get much colder than ""cool"".)"
"Spoils of the 10/11/03 Knoxville Raid."
"Deep copper color.Minimal head & almost zero lace. Fruitcake/spicebread, candied citrus, coriander and orange zest in the nose. Rich and chewy mouthfeel, and a creamy texture. The taste mimics the nose with spicy fruitcake, and candied citrus. The beer is nicely malted and hopped to a good balance providing a slight bitter finish. The alcohol hides well and the beer finishes mildly sweet. Probably just the thing to drink around the fireplace with friends and family."
"Drinkability: Not as intense as i would have liked for a Christmas beer. There are other Christmas beers i would definitley prefer. Having said that, it is still a worthwhile beer...hey, i've tried pure crap in the past and this isn't crap. It's good."
"Very, very storng beer that comes at a very, very high price. I bought a faux-earthenware bottle of this stuff for $7.50. It pours a very deep brown, and reminded me of wine than beer. Deep flavors of raisins, burnt malt, strong alcohol, lots going on here. Great on a cold night, will definitely warm your fingers and toes."
"Update  The 2006 vintage if more of the same without the buttery taste. Maybe the 04 I had was an anomaly? Anyway, an all around excellent brew."
"Wow what a good beer!!This would be a great beer on a cold winters night to warm the cockels of your heart!!Not to mention a cool looking bottle!This beer poured a medium sized ivory head with fine-small sized bubbles that very quickly dissipated.The first glass poured a very dense, carbonated body and the second glass poured a clear body.The hue was light brown and the nose was definitely alcohol and fruit...apples?The initial taste was that of alcohol and some apples and spices.It had a smooth and tingly mouthfeel along with a burning sensation as it was swallowed.Aw yes, a Belgian Strong Ale...one of my favorite beer styles and a high ABV to go along with it!"
"This beer pours a hazy yellow color with a thin white head that leaves some lacing on the glass. The aroma is spicy and yeasty with some citrus notes. The flavor was very spicy and enjoyable. Very easy to drink, but lots of alcohol that is well hidden. I think this is the best offering from the Delirium company."
"Deep reddish brown, looks illuminated and attractive. Nice head formation and delicate lace that sticks well to the glass. Nice complexity to the aroma, spiced mulled fruits and a bit of sour dough yeastiness. Mouthfeel is medium, slightly sticky but with medium carbonation, though not as creamy as some. Flavor lacked some of the holiday spiciness I was looking for, quite a lot of wine-like tartness and lacking some of the fleshy fruits and cinnamon bits. Some pepper and a bitter ginger bite leaven the acidity late and there is an alcoholic rummy sense at the close. Always good to save a ""big one"" for the Summer months, but this was a slight disappointment..."
"Medium brown color. Small head. Aroma is malty and yeasty. Medium bodied. Malty, yeasty and fruity. Spicy, but not overly so. Slight vinous quality. Drinkable, and hides it 10% alcohol content well. It is a little disappointing as a xmas beer, spices do not add to the quality of this beer. Mouthfeel is full. Finish is crisp. Aftertaste is slightly bitter."
"Pours to a ruby-brown color with just a ring of lacing. The aromas are sweet, fruity, and somewhat medicinal. The flavor is medicinal/herbal, and yeasty, with a sweetness that flows to a drying finish. It also has somewhat of a spicy flavor to it as well. It is a beer with a strength that will catch up to you. A very enjoyable beer."
"At first, I liked this beer; by the time I was 2/3 through, I wanted to pour it on the ground. Very strange. There is something unsatisfying about this beer. It has a kind of stale, gassy aftertaste, like freezer burn on a good steak."
"Beautiful orange color with a slight head.A slight phenolic nose with a hint of banana.Alchohol is right up front on the tongue with a nice warming after effect.Great mouthfeel-more complex then the ""delirium tremens"" triple.A great drinkability at a mild 10%-perfect for a Winters night-or a nite cap in July if you ask me."
"Color is a dull scarlet red. A sticky ivory white head sits on top and lasts a while. The aroma is very sweet and fruity. Pears, apples and grapes come to mind. Mouthfeel is of light and spritzy carbonation and body is medium. Definite pear tones in the flavor. Acidic to an extent. Alcohol is splashed all over the place, but is not flaming. Some slight bubblegum esters. All in all, this is very drinkable. The aging has taken some of the flame away. Decent beverage."
"Drinkability & Notes: A mediocre brew, actually I was quite disappointed being that I have been quite happy with the rest of the Dellirium brand. I could hardly finish the bottle."
"The flavor was a great complex mixture of holiday spices, fig, and some other fruit tones. Unfortunately, this was a little too sweet for my taste. The sweetness came through on the end and in the after taste. I will drink if someone offers it, but I will not go out and buy it myself."
"Deep amber-orange in color with a highly carbonated eggshell head that fades after a couple of minutes. Left no lace on my glass. Fruity aromas dominate the nose. I smell cloves, alcohol, and raisins. The taste is very smooth, fruity and dry with a nice alcohol warmth. A very well balanced brew. Finishes with a crisp sweetness that is just right. Way to quaffable far a 10% ABV but I like it. I'm glad I stocked up on these but I really don't think I'll have the willpower to sit on them too long."
"Bottled 2001. Clear deep ruby hue. Fluffy, thick, loose slowly receding vanilla white head. Rounded wisps of lace remain. Snap of bright, sugary red fruit reminscent of candied strawberries upfront in aroma, immediately followed by mellower caramel sweetness, and mild bubblegum esters. Trace clove phenol. Tame, but pleasant aromawise. Honey like sweetness initially in flavor is ceded by notes of bready malt and molasses. Fruitiness then sets in mid palate and doesn't waver, and contrary to the aroma has a vinous, alcohol soaked, fermented berry nature. Moderate in body with a well attenuated, dryish, deceivingly crisp mouthfeel. Subdued hop bitterness and clove eek along as an undertone. Finishes w/ residual sugars briefly lingering on the palate quickly offset by darts of peppery alcohol. Although not as substantial in overall character as other Dark Strongs, Delirium Noel exhibits excellent balance. Smooth, delicious and dangerously bereft of alcohol harshness. This bottle has cellared very well."
"A good first beer to ease me into the 2 day festival ... lovely stuff."
"I had the prvilidge of tasting this one a beer tasting event out in Long Beach with several other B.A.'s.Just by looking at the bottle and the logo of Pink Elephants is rather intersting to note what can be the outcome to this.The appearance of this has a nice somewhat cloudy amber color with a medium head. The first sip was a quick hint of either milds pears and spice with a good bitter taste. I've heard its a season brew, but I have been getting some recent info on it being served on tap in some locations, if its spotted get a pint."
"I more or less agree with other reviews on this beer. This beer has a lot of potential I believe. There is a good hop blend, and great bouquet and the initial taste is excellent. But he finish is rough with a little of the ugh factor sneaking in on the finish. I would recommend shelving hits one till next Christmas. with the large volume of alcohol is it going to be hard for the yeast to refine this some more. But it will refine. To me this one just wasn't ready to drink yet. It needs more time in the fermentation stage to get the flavors a little more mellowed out and refined. Right now there is just to much contrast with the varying flavors."
"F"
"This poured into the glass with a high & tight head, just this side of off-white. Reddish-amber liquid. Nose is wonderfully fresh, malty fruity and a bit hoppy too. Taste starts with a blast of medium maltiness then the healthy amount of hops mix with alcoholic warmth. Finishes up dry and very drinkable, I would recommend this to any fan of ""Big Beers"" without hesitation. Delicious!"
"All in all another winner from brewey Huyghe. Good by itself or with seasonal treats. In the end the pink elephants say it all."
"2000 750ml grey bottle with pink Elephants pulling santas sliegh, pours a bright cloudy reddish-orange color. Fruity aroma of pears and tropical fruits, small bubbly head, bready, spicy fruity apple flavors, soft and full palate, nice lasting finish, very well hidden alcohol at 10%, warming feel, a great winter ale."
"Happy Holidays"
"Now this is a Belgian! I had this on tap, and it was my first time, so I was pretty excited to see this one. Rich dark amber color, not a lot of lace left in the glass as I enjoyed this one. A light malt taste with a prominent belgian yeast profile. A very full-bodied beer, but I didn't really pick out too many flavors individually. I drank this one along side a glass of water to keep my palate cleansed and also to ward off what seemed to be a high alcohol content. The alcohol aftertaste didn't register that high, I just 'knew' this beer was strong, although I didn't know how strong until I checked it out here at BA. I don't think I could drink more than one at a sitting, but I will definitely order this again. If you like Belgians, this is a very good beer, you will like it!"
"Overall I am very impressed with this beer. Again, another one that I would like to cellar for awhile. Buy one (or five) this holiday season and drink it next holiday season."
"Always a pleasure to drink this beer on a cold night. But remember the label has Pink Elephants with Santa Hats  so dont take this beer too seriously!!!"
"428"
"Delirium is one of my favorites, this is no disappointment. Pours a medium brown with a nice head that laces throughout the glass. Murky aroma, and, stay with me, floral, fruity, dry, somewhat licorace like first taste. Very complex, very nice. You can almost smell the carbonation, effervecence. Crisp, dry finish with hints of plum. Just a damn good Belgian, Seasonal or not."
"On the pour a delicious orange to cherry red color as it sits in the glass. The body covered by a voluminous head, frothy in texture that melts to a fine sheet of lace that drapes the glass. Aromas of ripe fruit, such as pineapple and banana with hints of yeast also a underlying malt sweetness, quite a refreshing. Start is agreeably sweet, the top voluptuous in feel, the finish has a razor-sharp acidity and the hops scrumptiously hopped, malt dry aftertaste that has a slight alcohol bitterness. The big 10% ABV, warms the tummy and seals off a quite quaffable beer."
"A dizzying onslaught of divine taste!"
"Color of iced tea or a dark cider, with a thick, almost tan-colored head. Simultaneously sweet and sour in the nose; some yeast and barnyard aromas as well. Medium carbonation. Taste definitely runs toward the sweet side, but not too syrupy or cloying. The Belgian candy sugar is apparent. Pleasantly warming on the way down from the alcohol. The sweetness and alcohol become more pronounced as the brew warms, with brandy and port-like characteristics emerging. Will keep you warm on a winter's night for sure."
"Not a bad Belgian brew.  Delerium is one of my favorite Belgian brands and Noel is no exception.  It is rather fruity to the nose, drinks a bit harsh at the start, but finishes extremely well.  With the high ABV, not for the faint of heart.  Bottoms up!"
"They advertise as the best beer in the world, well I wouldn't go that far but it is a very good one.  The alcohol is hidden well and will slip up on you, after four I could feel it..LOL.  The smell woldn't bring me to this beer but it did have a very interesting taste.  Not for the novice beer drinker........CHEERS"
"Oh, and VENOM, I agree...the foil top is a pain to remove."
"These Belgians always taste so sweet to me..like straight cane sugar...I think I read somewhere they use like candy sugar or something like that...I'm no expert on this style, but I'd prefer a barley-wine when opting for the high alcohol beer..This is pretty smooth...creamy...sweet.....sweet....sweet.....minimal if any hopping...I had a much better belgian at a bar this dude bought me around Christmas but I can't remember the name...it was a treat...this is very good but not at that level..."
