"No notes at this time?! You people are retarted!  What a crappy website!  Thanks for nothing!"

"Interesting but not overly impressive. Aroma is a bit stale and is more reminiscent of an English Ale than a Belgian.  Plum, spices and some cola flavors."
"First time trying this holiday bier...Outstanding!"
"Reddish brown with a fine white head. The spice aroma comes in right away with a subtle sweetness that has a brown sugar tinge to it. A bit of estery yeast in the  nose, not much. Pretty mild hops, had hoped for a piney profile. Didn't get it. The flavor is spicy in the initial with some clove-cinnamon, followed by the dried fruit of what to me was fig, raisin, and date which lent a brown sugar-honey combo. Very nice. Finishes with  the sweet and yeast for the signature Belgian flavor. As expected, the dried fruit, sweet, and estery  components increase as the beer comes to temp."

"Candi sugar and spicy yeast profile are the bulk of this intensely smooth 9% Belgian brew. Doesn't even drink nearly like 9% ABV."

"Delicious winter ale. A bit on the sweet side but a delicate finishing touch with a nutty/flowery (a bit contradictory, I know) taste."

"O - I really enjoyed the Affligem Dubbel and Tripel, and once again they have impressed. Right up there with my favorite Belgian Christmas, the St. Bernardus. Would gladly purchase this beer again, maybe even go out of my way to seek it out."
""
""
"Medium bodied, light but tangy effervescence. A bit of warming develops after the temperature comes up some and some of the liquid goes down. Reasonably smooth to drink if not smooth across the tongue. A really fine brew."

"O: Delicious. It has that orange flavor to it that (along with the season's spices, of course) is characteristic of Belgian winter/Christmas ales. This is one of my favorites of the style and from the brewery."
"O-great winter ale with a little alcohol heat great dark fruit and spice flavor"
""

"Overall: A nice brew for this Nor'easter coming our way. Good to be inside with this tasty brew."

"O- fantastic, absolutely fantastic."

"This brown, explosively effervescent beer is the epitome of a Belgian Christmas brew. Sugar and spice. Malt and caramel and yeast. The head is enormous and long lasting. Warmth and spritzy liveliness. Full body...the beer is a very enjoyable seasonal treat."
""
"Mouthfeel is good. Dry, sweet high carbonation and medium bodied."
"If you are looking for a damn fine Christmas cookie in a bootle, this is the top of the 2013 class I've tasted to this point (I'll save my St Bernadus for Christmas day). The whole toffee/malt/spice flavor vulcan mind meld is a step beyond other seasonal beers and Affligem's trippel. It is almost Christmas... if you've not earned your lump of coal yet, after a couple of these you may."

""
"Pretty darn good, all things considered. A lot of beer. Festive."
"A rosy walnut brown color with a scant bit of off- white head that essentially disappears quickly and leaves no trace of lace. The aroma suggests vinous fruit and malty grain, tart and crisp. The flavor offers deep malts and a slighly grassy bite. There's some dark fruit presence and pineapple highlights. The body is medium with fair carbonation for a relatively smooth feel. A solid brew"

"Overall- Good to very good. Not overwhelming as this beer thrives as result of its mellow character. Definitely worth a try if you like Belgians and at this age, it's very accessible for non Belgian drinkers."

"750 ml bottle into signature chalice, bottled on 8/16/2012. Pours slightly cloudy ruby red color with a 1 finger fluffy light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty lacing clings on the glass, with some moderate streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of raisin, apple, caramel, molasses, nutmeg, cinnamon, toast, candi sugar, light clove, bread, and yeast earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of deep malt with yeast esters and spices. Taste of raisin, apple, caramel, molasses, nutmeg, cinnamon, toast, light clove, candi sugar, toffee, pepper, bread, and yeast earthiness. Lingering notes of light fruits, caramel, molasses, nutmeg, cinnamon, toast, candi sugar, light clove, toffee, bread, pepper, and earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice balance and complexity of malt flavors with fruity yeast esters and spicing; with a great malt/spiciness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a fairly slick and moderately prickly mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a small warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is an excellent spiced Belgian strong ale! Great balance and complexity of malt, yeast esters, and spices; and very smooth to sip on. A very enjoyable offering."

"Murky chocolate brown with creamy head, but no Belgian Lace. Dried fruit- raisins dominate while black licorice comes out. Taste of spices and dried fruit (plums and raisins). A bit sharp- lots of carbonation. Nice alcohol warming. A good winter beer, perhaps with a little more conditioning the sharpness will mellow out."
"The flavor is quite sweet thanks to the malts and Belgian sugars mentioned earlier. Molasses can be tasted too. Not much in the way of spices but the sweetness makes up for that. Low to moderate hop bitterness lingering on the tail end. Easy to drink even at 9% ABV."

"O: This is a very good Christmas ale, but not overly compelling. I would have again, and somewhat recommend, but there are better alternatives out there."
""
""
""
""
"Overall nice, almost a staple for a Belgian Xmas beers, most of the typical nice Belgian characters with light Xmas spices in there too."
""
"Pours a hazy reddish-brown with a foamy khaki head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small streaks and dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, brown sugar, dark fruits, spices, and an earthly, honey-like aroma. Taste is much the same with a dried dark fruit flavor and a slight alcohol kick on the finish. There is a mild amount of spice bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that I noticed gets markedly better as it warms up with time."

"O - In a more tradtional style this is a nice after dinner holiday beer. Was happy to share this with family. Open it and let it warm a moment in the glass before enjoying."
"O: It was what I expected and more, provided lots of holiday cheer, very delicious and well balanced and finely crafted beer, a must have on anyone's Christmas list."
""
""
"Beer is medium to medium-heavy in body, with quite active carbonation typical in Belgian beers. The result is a mouthfeel that is at first fizzy and somewhat prickly, but which quickly converts into a foamy, smooth experience. The result is sensation that at first wakes you and your palate up, then soothes them shortly after. Ethanol is detectable, but never burning or excessively hot for the ethanol content. Closes semi-dry with substantial stickiness remaining across the palate."
""
"O-A nice beer to try. Nice spice, taste. My wife who isnt even a beer drinker enjoyed this."
"Pours a syrup colored brown with a bit of foamy head. Nice bannana and spice belgian-syle dubbel...dried fruit, molasses, spice, and some nutty flavors. Relly well balanced, easy to drink, and good all around flavor. A bit over spiced - but nice brew."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: this beer is tremendous. Complex as all hell, flavorful and very well done. Enjoy next to a fire during the holiday season."
""
""
""
"O: This is a fantastic beer. There isnt a single part of this beer that lacks and I really wish this was year round. For a 750 at $6.50, that cant be beat!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A great beer, I honestly sometimes I wish I didn't share it. I know I sound greedy but this beer was damn good, priceless to time watching MMA with my dad. Salud!"

"Overall a very nice ale. Very Belgian tasting with spices."

"Well, it's discounted, but the sample I took before purchasing told me this stuff has held up just fine over the past couple of months. It pours a dark ruby-brown topped by a finger of khaki foam. The nose comprises dark fruits (focus on the fig, as per usual in this style), light red apple skin, cinnamon, brown sugar, clove, light cream, and a firm undercurrent of sweet caramel. The taste brings in more of the same, along with raisins, pumpernickel, and a light wisp of cocoa powder. The body is a lithe medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a generally smooth feel. Overall, a very nice BSDA, one of the best of the Affligem line in my eyes."

"I only had a few X-Mas beers during the season so I was looking forward to this, but eh. Darn good but not real exciting. Guess everyone can't be St. Bernardus."
""
"O: Cant wait till next year to open the other bottle ...mmmm"
""
""
""
""
"Mouth feels comfortable, medium tingle with a good fluff from the head. It is slightly creamy."
"It pours a ruby brown cup o love with a respectable 2"" head and long legs wearing fishnets for lacing. It's bottle conditioned, so watch out for the yeast at the bottom. Smell is malty, bready and yeasty. Taste is nice, rum raisin, cinnamon and coriander with no discernible hops and warming alcohol on the backend. It's a rich beer and while not as complex as some other examples of the style, it's good and worth drinking."
""
""
"The taste was also sweet malts but with some liquorice and spicey hop content too. Must not forget the yeasty feel to all the flavours and smell, this hung over the whole tasting like a ghost: reminding you that it's a Belgian Christmas beer you're drinking."
"750ml corked and caged bottle served in a chalice. Poured a dark copper with a finger of off white head. Bottle conditioned. Spicy aroma also seemed like there was some pine/spruce. Plenty of carbonation, medium bodied. Some caramel and burnt sugar, fair amount of malt sweetness. More spice in the finish. Also thought I tasted a little licorice. There was a lot going on here, I liked it."
""
""
""
"Overall: Its a tasty little beer. Lots of cherry and raisin flavor. Solid, but not mind blowing."
"There's no hop bite to create a crisp back, leaving it slightly lacking and an almost marshmallow/icing texture."
"overall - eh, nothing special - I was expecting a better beer for a Belgian Christmas beer."
""
""
""
"sticky on the tongue. though probably fairly sweet in its own right. spices shine through in the beer's tasting than in its sniffing. i suspect coriander and allspice were added but the rest of the phenolic elements were yeast related"
""
""
"Overall, I'm impressed. This beer has amazing flavor, balance, and is extremely smooth. I can't believe it's 9% ABV. A tremendous beer to drink during the Christmas season."
""
""
""
"D: This was a very nice BSDA with tasty scent and flavor. Not too spicy for a holiday ale. The body was phenomenal and the alcohol was super well hidden, so it was ridiculously easy to drink. Could probably cellar well, but very nice fresh. Recommended."

"In my house, Belgium dominates the Christmas seasonals every year. The winter seasonals and winter warmers pouring out of American breweries are fine - even better than fine. But the rich and textured tradition of Belgian Christmas brewing really shines in the weeks leading up to the biggest Christo-secular commercial frenzy of the year. One of my seasonal regulars is Affligem’s Noel. It pours dark brown and red, dotted with bubbles, and crowned with a great blustering head. Warm scents of apples and pears invoke the sweeter side of winter cooking, the scents soft, mellow and a hint of grainy dryness. The taste is less meek. Beginning with the apple and pear flavors, it shifts to a richer and savory palate of flavors: cream, cedar and a cheesy umami. The savory cascade ends with a light aftertaste of wheat, completing the cycle of flavors and beckoning another sip. The Affligem Noel runs through old world flavors at a comfortable pace, and orchestrates disparate flavors into a single, delicious beer. The Noel is a welcome new tradition to my present and future Decembers."
"This is really a great Belgian Strong Dark/Belgian Christmas Ale. Exactly what I had hoped for."
""
"Lost of carbonation and due to the yeast its pretty foamy. The head did dissipate quickly. Somewhat tanish whitish head and very mahogany brown. Kind of like a dubbel. The smell is very subtle tropical fruits to strong dark fruits. No hops in the smell at all. In the taste, there is a ton of sweet malty fruits and it leaves a tropical fruit tang. Very nice and the spices are subtle but they are there. The mouthfeel is medium sticky and leaves a pleasant flavor. Overall, this is a top notch beer. As it warms, you get the flavor of the grains to balance the sweetness. An amazing beer indeed and perfect for the holidays. Not as spiced as I thought but I must say its not as warm as I would like and as it does I am sure it will have flavors jumping out of it."
""
"A great beer for Christmas Eve in front of the fireplace."
""
""
"O-A nice beer to try. Rich yet not too overpowering. A great winter beer!"
""
"O: This is a good seasonal beer with enough reminisces of autumn in it's profile to put you in the holiday spirit, but as an example of the style itself I wouldn't choose this over Chimay or Gulden Draak on any given weekday."
""
""
"As I try more Belgian winter ales I am confronted with the fact that I just don't like winter spices in beers. If the Belgians can't make it work, what hope do I have? Metallic flavors or aromas are never really good qualities in beer. I'm hoping mine acquired this aroma in transit and it isn't built into the recipe. Candied sugar is too strong in this one, which is an unfortunate pitfall in many Belgian dark ales. Let's try to balance high alcohol content and bitter malts with sweet dark fruits and delicate carbonation next time."
"Probably the best Christmas beer I've had this year. The spices are really pleasant, and this is a very fun beer."
""
"O: It's okay. Smells alot better than it tastes. It's odd to call this a Noël as it's basically the same as Chimay, Duvel, or any other common Belgian. Warming it up doesn't help, either."
""
""
""
""
"Overall it is a good beer, but I expected more. I would have liked to have tasted a fuller, richer malt flavor."
""
""
""
""
"I'd like to re-review this one down the road to make sure the beer is A-ok...because i give this one high marks as is."
""
""
""
""
"O - for me this is a must try for those who enjoy a well made Belgian brew or those who just may be in the Christmas spirit. First time I've seen this on the shelves and I hope it's not the last. It's very tasty and the aroma is wonderful."
""
"O- Good Christmas beer, but maybe not especially memorable. Don't know that I'll go out of way for it next year."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Drinkability and Overall Impression: I found this one quite drinkable and an easy sipper with each sip leading naturally to the next. I’ll certainly be happy to have this again and may even decide this year or next to order a case and have it be my Christmas beer for the season. My overall impression is that this is first rate beer and flawed only by a lighter bodied mouth feel and a touch too much sweeness that doesn’t get balanced out by the hop finish."
""
""
"O - A very nice Christmas ale, not very special but very tasty and worth having a try."
"Pours a copper color w/ a one finger cocoa head. Fairly average lacing on my tulip glass. Good looking holiday brew. Nose is malt, Belgian yeast, spices, and bread. Really nice, although it could be stronger- it's a little on the weak side. Taste is better than the nose, w/ toffee and caramel coming out in addition to the nose profile. Excellent. Feel is medium w/ good carbonation and a nice malt backbone. Overall, I really enjoy this beer- a great holiday brew when it gets cold outside. Cheers."
"A solid beer and a suitable choice for the holiday season."
"This pours a nice clearish tea color with a decent white head which quickly dissipates. The smell is pretty great some fruit like banana and a pretty decent malt smell, nice brown sugar and caramel. The feel is medium with high carbonation, very tingly. The taste is wonderful, lots of malty tastes, some dark fruit and a nice dry finish. Overall an excellent winter weather beer, glad I bought this."
"A quality beer."
"Dark reddish-brown with a nice thick beige head. Aroma is fruity and dubbel-ish with dark fruits, caramel, brown sugar, and Belgian yeast. Flavor is more of the same with dark fruity notes, a little sour apple, and winter spices thrown in. Medium body and smooth on the palate. A decent Belgian x-mas ale."
"Overall: Good brew"
"O - Had this on tap and I liked it, the bottle was lacking. Maybe if I waited a year or so this would have been a better experience."
"Overall: its a very nice beer but nothing great above average"
"Mellow, easy drinking beer that's moderately complex and great for the holidays."
"Had this on tap at Cole's in Buffalo. Pours an amber-brown colour with thick off-white head. Lots of lacing around the glass. Smells of licorice, dark fruit and some spices to go along with the Belgian yeast. Some alcohol is noticeable in the flavour, I find the licorice sticks around as an after-taste. Fairly smooth mouthfeel for the style. A really nice Belgian xmas beer."
"A good beer that's nothing special."
"D: Big ABV is a little daunting, but worth a try. Flavorful and interesting; complex."
"M, D- Medium bodied with lively CO2, the drinkability was good."
"Notes: This is an excellent holiday classic that fills you palate with wonderful flavor and warms your body and soul."
"This beer is perfect for a cold night, inside or on an enclosed patio, enjoyed with friends or family all night long."
"D: Another very good Belgian Christmas beer. I will have to pick up some more of these for next year."
"Poured from 750ml bottle into a heavy chalice. Poured bright clear amber with a off white bubbles, fragrances of dark candy, carmel, malt, soft spices of pepper and cinnamon, taste of of lightly sweet malt and hops, has mixed signals, this had the fragrance of a triple & dubble, and taste of a dubble. One of my top winter brews."
"d: A bit sweeter than I prefer generally, but I think this was an aged bottle. Overall this worked surprisingly well."
"The beer pours a dark amber/brown color with a thick frothy off-white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is great! It has a rich, malty scent that boasts of crystal malts and dark fruit. The yeast esters provide a good deal of character. The taste is good. It has a smooth, dry, malty flavor that's rich and warm with some excellent dark fruit character. It's sweet and fruity with a touch of warmth in the finish. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a terrific winter seasonal. It's a mellow, easy drinking beer that's moderately complex and great for the holidays."
"Overall impression: similar to a dubbel, this is a great noel, however, the overall acidity takes away from the true flavor."
"Very drinkable for such a high abv. One bomber was just right for the second half of the Jets/Patriots game. Seems like this could be called a dubbel to me."
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied and retains a chewy quality, while the suddenly fleeting carbonation is perfect for the style. This is not a breakthrough beer but is a runner-up for expressive yeast strain. Most of the alcohol is well concealed and some yeast and spices linger. Nicely drinkable, but playing second fiddle to other Belgian seasonals like St. Bernardus Christmas."
"Smooth very smooth, I regret getting only one bottle this holiday season"
"D: For 9% abv this is very drinkable, the mouthfeel is a lot like a soda so its tough to drink it quick as the carbonation attacks your tongue a bit, but thats not a problem as I like to sip on this one. Very nice example and great for the holidays!"
"D: Great to share and drink 750mL all 750mLs would could be too much with this one."
"Pours a clear reddish-brown with a LARGE off-white head. I mean, this head is huge, and it doesn't mind hanging around for a bit. Poured the beer two minutes ago and the head is still at about an inch and a half. Scent is strong Belgian yeast character with delightful spices and caramel. Smell is very lovely. Very grainy and spicy with evident alcohol presence. Taste is initially a lot of dark fruit and caramel...maybe even hints of toffee. Very strong flavors of spice and malt with grain. Smells more boozy than it actually taste. Taste is very complex and well balanced with the flavors. Mouthfeel is very smooth and full bodied...nice and slightly creamy. Drinkability is fairly high."
"Flavors really stand out as it warms. Alcohol becomes noticeable too, but still well masked."
"The only thing I don't love about this Jesus juice is the carbonation. Just a little too much for me. Otherwise it's as much a Christmas miracle as the virgin birth."
"jd"
"D: A tasty Belgian Strong Dark. Nothing outstanding, but good all around."
"I really enjoyed sharing the large bottle of this with my friend. I'm fairly inexperienced with ""wintery"" styles of beer and I know that most of what I have tried, I haven't been too fond of. I enjoyed that this beer seemed to have more carbonation to it, I felt that it balanced the high alcohol content well. It has a bit of spice, and a nice malt and I give the fizz credit for the exceptional mouthfeel though I could see how some may not enjoy that aspect as much as I do."
"Overall: This is a great Christmas beer. It has complex flavor and is not to heavy thanks to the carbonation. It has a great aroma and finish. I have one that I plan to age for a year. I will update this when I drink it next year."
"Notes: Their offerings are typically rather remarkable but this seasonal one is among the best I've tried from this brewery. And true, the price/quality ration was quite remarkable too..."
"Recommended as a Christmas beer."
"I expected a great holiday beer from this brewery, and I got. Happy holidays are even happier with a fine Belgian ale in hand..."
"D: The beer is extremely easy to drink because the alcohol is well masked."
"A very good seasonal brew that did not dissapoint. I should have bought 2 bottles to share!"
"Typical strong, dark Belgian but that's what I like."
"D - The mouthfeel description continues to the drinkability, does not feel to heavy at all. Spiced beers can be overdone so easily but their restraint makes this beer a joy to drink."
"Medium bodied with lots of peppery spice as well as hints of cinnamon and nutmeg. Picking up notes of nut, cherry and plum. Slightly oily with soft carbonation up front. Sweet yet with a nice malt backbone and a dry finish that has some slight alcohol warmth."
"D: A well made, drinkable beer."
"drinkability: strong yet mellow, it is very drinkable, higher abv, dynamic flavor that is festive but does not overdo it."
"D: A nice dark ale. Tastes like a dark ale, but feels like a lighter beer."
"D - A middle of the road at best in terms of both Belgian Strong Dark Ale and winter seasonal offerings... Not terrible, but nothing to right home about either... I will manage to get the bottle down, but probably won't seek out in the future..."
"After pouring from this pint bottle, the foam was dark wheat in color and smooth. Color was a deep auburn with amber, gold, and maroon highlights. It had a dominate hops (yet subtle) with hints of roasted barley and spices. It had a dominate hops taste but was balanced out by the underlined orange peel, and spices like nutmeg and cinnamon. Mouthfeel - full-bodied and clean. Drinkability - With the nice balance of hops, roasted barley, orange peel and spices, it made a great holiday beer to be sipped upon like a brandy."
"D: it's good, just not the style that I like. I also have to admit that I'm a little bored by these strong, super sweet beers that have no hops or malt, it reminds me more of a liqueur, or cough syrup, than beer. I know that I'm probably alone in this, but they really all seem to taste the same."
"The body was full and rich, coated the tongue nicely. Drinkability was very good for such big brew, smooth and flavorful. Overall, a very nice brew, certainly worth seeking out."
"Solid on the drinkability meter for a 9% beer - good combo of aromas and flavors, but the aromas were the real winner here."
"It wasn't quite the big Christmas beer such as Delirium Noel that I had hoped. However, Affligem Noel is a fine BSDA, tasty with an excellent texture, and very likable. Well done."
" M- This beer has a medium-light mouthfeel with no alcohol heat noticed. D- This beer has a caramel and cidery flavor to it but not much depth beyond that. Just not very interesting or rich in flavor."
"D-Interesting, but there are others out there I prefer."
"Drinkability: A tasty brew with good balanced flavors. I like the spices and juicy malt. Though it is a strong beer I find it dangerously drinkable."
"This is a solid Belgian though it's not quite as big and complex as similar ABV beers in the style."
"D - It'll take me all night to put this 750 down myself but it can be done. It's more of a sipping beer and could have waited til next year for the alcohol to cool off just a bit. Good though."
"D: Good."
"Drinkability- really good I liked it a lot."
"Notes: A really good Strong Dark Ale and a nice tribute to Christmas from Affligem, all of whose beers I found to be very solid indeed."
"D: The drinkability is average to me although it's very palatable. The brew tastes good, smells good, feels great but too sweet and more of a two and through for me."
"D - This is a great Belgian holiday seasonal that drinks very well. It would also be a great candidate for aging as well. This was Santa's little helper on Christmas Eve assisting dad in the gift build-out and wrapping process. :)"
"D: A fantastic Belgian dark ale for the winter season. At 9% it has the warming sensation and rich meld of dark Belgian sugars to create a rich, full-bodied fruity ale without creating too many harsh alcohol flavors. An excellent sipper for a chilly winter's night. Open a bottle and split with someone who enjoys the finer points of Belgian brewing as well."
"D - This is a good Belgian ale. It was great to drink on Christmas eve."
"Got this on on tap at my Favorite local bar, while the wife got a rasberry lambic, it looks like an apple cider, a cloudy brown brew with a small head. Smell is kinda weak, some light hops and spices are the most prevalent, taste though is very good, full robust flavor, the warmer it gets, the more flavors start to come out. Mouthfeel is awesome, a thick syrupy body to it makes it extra good, very good beer overall"
"D) A well crafted brew. Festive in flavor and taste."
"D: Of the three Belgians I had on Christmas eve, this was the third place finisher. But it's still an excellent beer that I will revisit on a future holiday."
"D: Tasty, goes down ok, not too filling, good kick, good representation of style, it's a decent beer overall and if you're into the sweetness I can see how someone would like this beer."
"Mouthful is a little creamy, but not overly thick...yummy...satisfying!"
"The mouthfeel was about the most attractive part of this beer. It was not overly carbonated but I would say perfect. Almost to the point of being lively. Drinkability was pretty good being my 2nd 750ml bottle of the night."
"D: A tasty, pleasant Belgian winter seasonal. I would prefer a bit more robustness here, particularly in the somewhat underpowered nose. Still, a very nice ale to sip on during a cold, snowy December night."
"A perfect way to celebrate Christmas. Hides the alcohol well."
"Deeeelicious, and quite appropriate for sharing with my in-laws today. One of the better strong dark Belgian ales I've had in recent memory. Thanks, Meghan."
"ABV is noticeable."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability: Very crisp carbonation makes this beer a real treat. It goes down smooth and goes great with food."
"Sante!"
"D: Drinkable enough, not great but OK."
"A sipper for cold nights but one that is easy to keep sipping."
"It is very drinkable. Affligem provides a warming alcohol feeling and a leaves clean hoppy taste on the palate."
"D - Not quite as good as other Belgian strong dark ales available, but still very enjoyable. Great flavor and body. Overall a good Belgian style at an affordable price."
"The taste is convincing in its crisp power. Yeasty, bold and fruity with a distinctly alcoholic finish. This beer reminds me of dark chocolate-covered cherries served topped with the tiniest trace of nutmeg. It lives up to its name as a ""Christmas Ale"" because it certainly does remind me of a crackling fire, chestnuts roasting, and warm spirits."
"OVERALL pretty easy drinking, but oughta be savored. Very well done. Super smooth."
"The beer pours an amber brown color with pretty good head retention and lacing. The nose is spice filled, wtih mandarin orange, clove, nutmeg, holly and maraschino cherry. Flavors replicate the nose, but with considerable vanilla, spice and citrus. Mouthfeel is medium bodied; nothing extraoridairy here. Drinkability is very good for the abv., though the combination of moderate sweetness, spice, and alcohol make it difficult drink more then a small glass. Still, this is very nice, very solid beer from Affligem. Nice beer."
"Poured from 750ml bottle into a tulip. Has a reddish caramel color with a very large tan head that has good retention before settling to a thick cap. Moderate amount of lacing is left on the glass. The aroma consists of sweet caramel malt, candied sugar, and dark fruit. Also has some vinous qualities. Alcohol is well hidden. Mildly spiced and just slightly sweet tasting. Flavors of caramel, plums, figs, mildly spiced, and some vinous flavor. The substantial ABV is not detected. Medium bodied and has a nice texture. Not quited silky smooth but it is getting there. Affligem did not go overboard with adding spices to their Chrismas Ale so it is not much different from standard strong dark ales. Despite the high ABV I found this very drinkable and one of the better choices to enjoy on a brutally cold evening."
"This is a tasty little brew. While it's not as good as their tripel, this is a really quality BSDA. It definitely has a winter warmer appeal. Oh, and at less than $8 for a 750ml, it's a damn good deal."
"D: One of my favorite winter seasonals, relying on quality brewing rather than spices to dress it up."
"Hands down, the best Christmas beer I've had. I'd love this to be available year round. Dark mahogany brown with a nice ruby edge around the glass. The tan head was thick like whipped eggs. Chocolate and dark fruits are quickly apparent in the nose. A hint of spiciness, but definitely not overdone. There's also a nice banana note mixed in. Caramel/bready malts are also in the mix. I didn't notice the 9% ABV a bit. This goes down very easily."
"Recommended music pairing - A Mormon Tabernacle Choir Christmas"
"A solidly tasty Belgian, but it doesn't particularly stand out other than being well-priced."
"D: Nice example of the style, while being less-cloying enough to resemble the taste of Belgian Strong Pale Ales."
"D - Such a big beer, but nice for one!"
"A solid, drinkable dark Belgian."
"Sweet without the complexities one might expect from the style. Yet as a 'Noel' perhaps I should hold it to a different, yet lower, standard? The beer does indeed improve with warming, exhibiting some favorable yeast notes and a better malt balance, yet still seems a touch off the mark.."
"Merry Christmas in July"
"The taste is heavily of caramel and some type of fruit. Perhaps apricots and rainsins. Not the easiest drinker, but gives me a nice warming feeling in my stomach. I might have to pick up another bottle to cellar for the holiday season. Definitely worth the seven dollars I paid for the wine-sized bottle."
"'"
"2008 is the likely year of production for this light copper color holiday ale, that pours with a nice white head. Hint of sweet fruity raisin in the nose. Big and very well balanced flavors with big malt and hints of sweet spice, orange peel and candi sugar. Finishes long and a bit hoppy. Very nice!"
"Finish lasts forever, chalk full of spices, sweetness, and a lingering sourness."
"D - Way to drinkable, I love this in the bottle as much as I love it on tap."
"D- This is a great beer to sip on a cooler night in front of the fireplace as you ponder the complexities. Highly Recommended!"
"Breadiness is dominant in the flavor while there are also some notes of holiday spices...perhaps some nutmeg and cinnamon. Sweet caramel malts abound at first then finishes quick and clean with more than a mere touch of hops. Not bad, not bad at all."
"D - Could be a session beer, nice around the holidays."
"7/4/7/3/16/3.7"
"Overall very interesting: a real tongue-twisting, style-bending beer."
"750ml bottle on sale for $4.99, nice. Ruby red color, good white head, clear and transparent. The label says this is brewed with spices and caramel color added. I have to wonder what is the point of adding artificial color but maybe they add actual caramel? Smells like a dubble, fruity but tastes like a quad. Flavor is intense malty spices, perfect for Christmas time. Easy to drink despite being a little sweet and I sure couldn't beat the price."
"Picked up a bottle of this the other evening as a treat during the Saturday football games. Brew poured to a murky brown color with a thick and sticky tan head that had incredible retention leaving chunks of lacing down the side of the glass. The aroma was nice, the malt aroma had a lot going on with caramel, nuts, dried fruit mixed with spices and a candy like smell. The flavors where close to the aroma, though at room temp there was a decent alcohol flavor. The feel of this brew was enhanced by the warming nature of the alcohol. Nice carbonation. This brew was good, would get this brew again."
"D- a tasty brew and slyly strong, alcohol doesn't become to pronounced until the end of the glass and by then it's too late. not too sugary and not too dry and full of interesting flavor."
"Poured this one into a large Belgian goblet. Well carbonated, produced a pretty golden head of about 3/4 inches, some thicker foam mixed with finer silk froth. Retention was decent but could have been a tad more lasting. Aroma was excellent -- a nutty fruit, with caramel, molasses, and a tad of spice. Taste matched the nose and was superb -- rich and well balanced. Some mild apple hints but not the cheap overpowering effect that you find in some of the less refined Belgians. Mouthfeel was light and a tad on the watery side, but not in a bad way, making for a very drinkable ale that could leave you blitzed in a hurry if your not careful. This liter left a very cheerful holiday buzz. All in all a very lovely beer."
"22oz. ""bomber"" bottle with a cork dated 9/07. Pours (into a tulip glass) a spectacular iced-tea-ish brown color with a large, foamy off-white Belgian head. The typical pillar of carbination rises from where the stem meets the bottom of the bowl. The aroma is rich & sweet, with hints of dark fruit, molasses & honey with a slight hint of the alcohol. 1st sip is rich with a dryness that belies the sweet aroma. Notes of raisin & plum come to mind, with a slight hint of honey. There's a hint of spice (cinnamon & nutmeg) on the swallow with an oh-so-slight alcohol burn. Mouthfeel is sparkly & effervescent! The 9% alcohol is very well hidden, almost TOO well!! DAMN THIS IS GOOD!!! I grabbed a bottle just for sampling & rating purposes...I hope there's a few left!!!"
"D - Awesome holiday ale, very drinkable for the style and ABV. Wouldn't mind having one of these on a cool night down at the beach."
"Defiantly a good beer to finish the holiday with"
"D: Pretty high. I drank most of the first one and then left it for a bit; by the time I returned, it was too warm to drink. I ordered another one later and enjoyed it. The flavors really come out as it warms, and it needs to be finished within an optimal temperature range."
"drinkability: Quaffable, but there are better winter warmers out there, both import and domestic. I may buy another bottle and sample again to give it a fair shake."
"D - Really good beer. Very impressed as most Affligem products are mostly so-so with me."
"D: A nice light holiday ale. I often drink the Tripel because it is a good value, this, I think, is a similar value. Gets a buzz on early. Nice holiday session beer to drink slowly."
"Not impressed by this one, maybe I got a bad bottle. Pours clear copper, thanks to the artificial caramel coloring, with a medium off-white head. Flat flavor. Caramel, malt, apple, corriander, nutmeg, and yeast. Problem is nothing really popped out, so everything seemed to drown in a soup of spice and malt."
"On tap at The Red in Santa Cruz. Pours a dark mahogany with a thick creamy head. Great lacing and retention. Aroma is prunes and caramel, with a nice spiced note. Flavor is burnt toffee, earthy pepper, allspice, bruised apple, and ginger. Pretty nice complexity. Mouthfeel is a little flat. Earthy and tasty, one of Affligem's best."
"D: Had two glasses and wanted a third. Tasty sipper."
"D: Not one to drink a whole bottle of yourself, but great to share."
"Pours a dark brown with a silky tan head. Excellent lacing. The nose has dark fruits, sweet candy malts, Belgian yeasts and Christmas spices. The taste didn't quite hold the complexity found in the nose. A nice blend fo bready malts, peppery yeasts and warm spices. Full body suits the style well. A great beer from Affligem."
"D: Really pleasantly suprised by this one. You think holiday beer and you think about the brewer bad touching you with cinnamon and other heavy spices. This was really well balanced. A very nice example of a winter beer without a pine tree garnish."
"A very nice offering for the holidays that I look forward to every year."
"The aroma is very citrusy and sweet with alcohol and caramel. The appearance is light red/brown with a large head. The flavor is not great but not bad and very much like the aroma. The main flavors are citrus and soap with some sweetness and toasted malt. The palate is smooth with some spices in the finish. Overall it's not a disappointment but not great."
"Cork dated ""9/07", bottle coded ""7 214 11"""
"Average body, too much alcohol and marzipan in the aftertaste too."
"This bottle's been waiting since last Christmas but I finally remembered it. The cork exploded out of the bottle as soon as I unwound the cage, luckily it was just air as no beer came out. The beer is dark and murky, a brown color with a little orange. The head was big and frothy, tan colored, and left no lace that I could see on the glasses. The smell was similar to several other Belgian strong ales I've had, it brings to mind Grotten Brown and maybe Nostradamus. The main aromas were dark fruits and yeasty esters. These came out in the flavor (plums, figs maybe) along with some alcohol burn. The body was OK, thick enough to match the flavors, and drinkability is good but tempered by the taste of alcohol."
"Bottle courtesy of Indybigtom: Poured a cloudy lightly filtrated brown color ale with a large foamy head with good retention and good lacing. Aroma of sweet malt with some nice fruity ester. Taste is a mix between some sweet malt with some fruity ester and some dry fruits such as raisins. Full body with limited filtration and no apparent alcohol. I have to admit that this one was quite good and exceeded my expectations."
"D - Tasty beer. I had it on a warm day but this would make a great holiday sipper. You wouldn't want to pound this but that's not what this is for anyways. Pretty drinkable for the style."
"Drinkability is solid for a holiday beer, one of the best that I have ever tasted in this category, can`t wait until next Christmas."
"Overall, this was one of the better Belgian Noel's I have had. Very rich and complex, and delightfully smooth I could have had this one again and again. Seemed to go over very well with the family, as it was the first bottle that was emptied. Come next year I will have to pick up another of these to try. Definitely have to recommend this one."
"A wonderful Belgian offering for those who harbor a sweet tooth."
"D--An hoiday special, so a spicy, sweet, rich, higher-ABV sipper...but drinkable and enjoyable nonetheless."
"It poured a Chestnut brown with a nice thick tan head into a tulip glass. I could smell chocolate, caramel, nuts, and spices right off the bat. The taste was pretty much the same and the flavors just pop on the palate. It has a great balance between the spices and the sugars. I feel that the '08 batch was right up there with the Bernardus Christmas Ale. Very tasty beer and very easy to drink. I am glad that I had it this year."
"Pours out a beautiful ruby tinged garnet with a ton of carbonation in the body and a huge, overflowing, foamy head that I had to ""cut"" off with a butter knife. Leaves some great, thick, full lacing. Smells of mild cinnamon, nutmeg and anise in the spicing category. I also get some spicy yeast, some orange, honey-covered fruits, and warm alcohol. I'm pretty unimpressed with the flavor here. Just has a vague (and overbearing) malt sweetness with some spicy, phenolic yeast tones and warming alcohol. Although, I don't like it when beers are spiced over the edge, they would have been more than welcome in this modest beer. Admittedly, there is a pleasant dried fruit thing going on in the middle and a really nice grassy and floral hop character in the finish. Finishes sweet. Mouthfeel is moderate with a great carbonation. Very bubbly, but the bubbles only make this feel fuller in the mouth rather than pricking the tongue. This is decent, but kind of sweet for me and without much that grabs me. It will be a bit of a chore finishing this big bottle."
"D - Pretty good. This is a great Belgian beer. It is not leaning too far to the sweetness and it has the exact amount of requisite Xmas sort of flavor to make is seasonally essential. I am very pleased and will likely find my way to this one again. An exceptional Xmas beer."
"D- I enjoyed this one a lot. A pleasure to pop open after stepping in from the 10* weather."
"Tasty with a fair amount of smoothness for abv. I've had more Christmasy (and fuller) Christmas beers, but this one does the job well enough and is tasty and warming enough to do well on a wintery night!"
"From a 750 ml bottle copped at Bottle King in Livingston, pours a beautiful caramel, light-brown color with incredible frothy, foamy head with real staying power... aroma is rich and thick, full of caramel, malts, spices, sweet candy, and brown sugars... taste strongly complements the smell, very creamy, rich, and thick, with incredible heavy flavors that continually linger on the palate... great mouthfeel... very creamy, with excellent drinkability for a 9% ABV... fig and prune taste do well to mask the hefty alcohol percentage... Loved Affligem Blonde, and this goes one step better... excellent beer... Definitely recommmended..."
"·	Drinkability: Very enjoyable and easy to drink. As I try to identify more flavors, it leaves you trying it again and again. Good Christmas style."
"D- High in alcohol so not too drinkable. Belgian styles are growing on me with help from such brews as this."
"Cork exploded out, pours a five+ finger light tan head that fades very slowly leaving some lace. Cloudy amber/brown color. Strong carbonation and medium bodied. Malty nose. Flavor sweet, raisin, some spiciness. Clean finish high ABV is not noticeable. $7.70 for a 750ml bottle from Colonial Spirits Acton, MA."
"From bottle, at home. Simple, pretty one-dimensional, but not in a bad way. Tastes like a very simple Belgian trippel with a little bit of Caramunich and some coloring agents. Good fruity esters in the middle of the palate. Reminds me of a Westmalle yeast at moderate fermentation temperatures, slight pepper. Very clean finish. Enjoyable, but kinda forgettable."
"Drinkability is pretty good, full and tasty, perhaps a bit to spicy right now, I'll bet it would be nice with a year one it. At less then $6/750ml, I'll get a chance to find out. Served strait from the cellar (only a few weeks old)."
"This Brouwerij Affligem offering is solid, if unspectacular. I can't see myself buying another bottle (even at a reasonable price of $7.49), but I'm beginning to get into the holiday spirit thanks to the sneakiness of the 9.0% ABV. Merry Christmas to all, and to all a good night."
"Drinkability is very smooth, but with incredibly high alcohol content, drinking many of these could be a serious task."
"Spicy, rich, regal toastiness in the nose. Sticky and...champagne-like mouthfeel. Begins sweet (freshly made toffee?) and slowly segues into a kalidescopic, all-enveloping/lingering warm alcohol finish. The sweet and the heat become one in an orgiastic furor. Yowza."
"Poured out of a 750ml corked and caged bottle. The appearance is a mud puddle brown color with a decent tight tan head that dissipated into a slight cap. The smell is of wine grapes, raisins, dates, prunes; a strong dark fruit aroma. The taste is a bit deeper than the aroma. There are notes of carob and chocolate followed by the dark fruit aromas; dark cherry & prunes. There is some subtle spice flavor. The feel is moderate with tight fizzy carbonation, finishes sweet yet bitter. A very good BSDA, though nothing that would make this stand out from most BSDAs. Probably the best Affligem brew tried to date."
"One word, Fresh! This beer pours a deep orange/brown color with cloudiness and a good head that recedes to a thin ring. The nose is very fruity, like fresh, fresh fruit. I can smell some spices. reminds me of some kind of spiced papaya or mandarin orange salad, that is what i would drink this with. The taste follows the nose, and the abv is almost indetectable. A little overcarbonated for a dark strong but by no means abrasive, good kick in the tongue. aftertaste lingers for weeks, and spices stick to the side of your mouth as the fructose taste syrups to your lips. It smells and tastes like some kind of body lotion or scented soap. I'm pretty sure if they churned this with butter, girls would rub it all over them. Maybe im just saying that cause im tipsy and alone, im gonna go to another site, ill be back in a few minutes. Good fruit flavors, but by no means overpowering. suttle spice and great drinkability for the abv. fantastic beer."
"Affligem Noël holds the honor of being my first ""aged"" beer. Tasted several years after it's release, its mellow compared to the fresh sample I had a week ago. Whenever the bottling was, this is one you can put on your Christmas wish list."
"Dark opaque amber color. Average one to two finger head when poured in wide chalice. Light malty aroma followed by a note of cloves and cinnamon. Up front rich malty and caramel sweetness accompanied by clove and cinnamon flavors. Tapers to smooth crisp finish. Lighter body than expected with soft carbonation. Good beer."
"Overall an excellent beer I'll be drinking more of."
"Pours a deep amber/ burgandy color with a tan head. Aromas of a sweet malt, alcohol, and spices of cinnamon, corriander, nutmeg. In the taste, cinnamon, chocolate malt and alcohol. A smooth and spicy mouthfeel, and a dry alcohol, cinnamon aftertaste. A fantastic beer, nice spice. Can't wait to have more."
"This is such a great beer! I have been drinking bottles ever since purchasing the 12 750ml bottles in January. It was such a great deal I couldn't pass it up. This is the second to last I have, and I plan on drinking the last on Christmas, which is appropriate. I imagine that this beer would hold up well for another year, depending on how funky one would want this beer to go. Earlier on this beer was maltier, but has taken on such wonderful characteristics during the 11 months so far."
"In the end a decent holiday Belgian Ale, but not all that memorable."
"Taste/mouthfeel: Bold flavors of caramel, burnt sugar and cinnamon. Sticky and fairly heavy, the beer finishes dry, lingering on the palate for quite a while. The 9% ABV is completely undetectable. This is really nice stuff, and at $7 a bottle it's pretty affordable too. Recommended."
"This is a very good Christmas ale. So often, seasonal ales based on Christmas don't tend to be very special. This one is."
"M/D-Medium bodied, lots of carbonation, and very smooth....the best part was that the 750ml bottle only cost me a $1.69(hence my drinkability)!"
"Pours a very dark, crystalline amber that looks too good to be real. Turns out it isn't -- this beer is colored with caramel. Why bother? Ugh. The aroma is quite spicy with coriander and cinnamon, and joined by some mild molasses notes. Rich and sweet on the palate, with plenty of spicing present from the start to the finish. Light fruitiness crops up at the mid-palate, but the emphasis is more on spices and sweet malts than fruit esters. Rich yeastiness comes out at higher temperatures. Mouthfeel is big in body and carbonation, although the carbonation is less than some other beers in this one's class. There's some residual stickiness in the back of the throat left by the caramel coloring. Overall, this is a good winter beer, and one that will probably age well, but I still don't get the caramel coloring thing -- it seems unnecessary and creates problems with mouthfeel."
"This is an ok beer for this style. The taste of alcohol is a bit too much, as is the carbonation. The taste in general is lacking a bit too, as it's almost like the spice cabinet fell in the beer. If you like this style of beer it's worth a glass if you come by it, but otherwise I'd pass."
"Mouthfeel is lacking and slightly watery. Overall an enjoyable beer that is average for the style."
"Drinkability - I'm not much into Belian beers, but I would try this one again."
"This beer looks as good as it taste. The lacing will last forever and as the beer warms you senses pick up more and more things happening with this beer. A must to try on any occasion."
"Overall: Solid offering and a good beer. Not up there with the greats but still solid. I'll be aging a few for sure."
"Poured into a St. Bernardus Chalice. Bottle says ""caramel color added"" so the appearance mirrors that - this is a nice cloudy reddish brown. The head is about a finger or so and the lacing is incredible. The smell is spicy and fruity - reminiscent of Christmas cookies, which means there's some bread/yeast in the nose as well. Taste is tart cherry in the front with a spicy malt middle and a bit of floral finish - very complex & delicious. This is well carbonated, which brings out the different flavors while adding another layer to this brew. This is an excellent Christmas beer, right up there with Delirium. Highly Recommended."
"Like the clerk at the liquor store said, ""You're going to love this one."""
"Happy Drinking!"
"A fine Belgian holiday offering."
"Pours a cloudy chestnut brown color with a creamy tan head that fades into a heavy lace. Nose is sweet, rich malt and Juicy Fruit bubblegum. Taste is caramel and dark fruit along with Belgian spice and yeast. Notes of chocolate malt towards the middle with a dry semi-spicy finish. Nicely done."
"A decent beer, very drinkable, but not nearly so complex or interesting as I might have expected. Basically a big, darkish Belgian session beer AFAIC."
"Affligem Noel pours hazy brown-red in color with an ample tan head. The smell is dominated by grassy notes and alcohol. The taste is hoppy at the beginning and end, the center of the taste is bready with a note of anise (black licorice) and other spices. The mouthfeel is full and somewhat creamy. As for drinkability, the beer is a solid sipper. I received it as a gift, but I will seek it out again."
"D: Good drinkability, as long as it's kept below cellar temp."
"D: Pretty tasty winter or if I were being pc, ""holiday"" brew...read=nice Christmas brew. Get it if you can, but there are others out there that I think are better. Nice high abv will warm the chest and make you silly like the fat man if you drink it by yourself..."
"Drinks great for the abv & a great Christmas ale. This really worked for me. Worth the $7.99 IMO"
"Body is just below big, with a perfect mouthfeel that is full, yet soft and creamy. An absolute bargain at $6.50 for a corked 750. I will certainly seek this out again before it 's gone for the season!"
"from Affligem. Very good!"
"Sip this one on a winters night."
"D - Mouth and taste lend this to being a very drinkable winter warmer. Now, you probably don't want to go out and session this, but I can't think of too many better beers to sip by the fire on a brisk winter evening. Cheers!"
"If you are looking for a good, rich (and possibly spicy) holiday beer for the cold, dark, rainy evenings, this isn't the one for you."
"Very drinkable. I wanna say almost a Quad."
"Christmas in early October, why not? Poured from a corked and caged 750 ml bottle a turbid brown color with a huge pillowy head that took forever to go down. Aroma was malty and spicy, with some ripe fruit mixed in the nose. Taste was of toasty malts, dark fruits(plums and figs), spicy hops and maple syrup. There was also a winey, vinous note that added to the experience. The beer had a medium to full bodied mouthfeel and was rich and warming. Alcohol was there but it didn't detract from the overall enjoyment of this brew. Very nice and one that I will drink again, especially during the colder months."
"I found this to be a very drinkable brew for its 9%ABV, as it warms it just became that more delicious. I poured the sediment into my last glass and it was amazing, give this one a try if you come across it."
"Not a bad little Christmas brew, here. Certainly the best offering Affligem has at present, in my opinion. Recommended."
"Dark brown  tan frothy head ; however , the head does not last long  nose of mocha , malt , red fruit , tawny port , and slight earthy  tastes are red fruit , tawny port , milk chocolate cameral subtle brown sugar - creamy , silky body- at chocolate slightly bitter with sweet brown sugar"
"A very good brew, except for the lack of aroma. It purs a beautiful ruby color with a beautiful head. However, there was very little bouquet, just some light malt notes. The taste was much better, presenting itself with a nutty, malty quality that was almost wine-like. There was a pleasant, slightly sour quality present. The mouthfeel was smooth and refreshing, witha very nice tart finish. For the high abv, it was refreshing and easy to drink (could be dangerous!!(lol))"
"Last swigs: Reminds me a little of Rochefort 8. It is with little wonder that this is in the Michael Jackson Beers of the World book. Glad that I found this at the Beverage Castle, even if it is a little overpriced."
"Opinion: I am really enjoying this beer. It has a really deep and complex malt profile going on that nicely compliments the esters present. It seems to change minute by minute, so you really can't get bored with this one. It is a little dry for my taste in beers like this, as I like them a little sweeter like Rochefort and such. This is still a mighty fine brew and one that I will surely partake in again."
"A bit after Christmas for sampling this beer in March, but the beer had no trouble waiting - this would hold up for much longer. Dense, robust flavor profile with caramel, prunes and brown sugar - just what you'd expect from this sort of winter fortifier. Surprisingly easy to drink for the heft - the alchohol was apparent, but not too hot. A beer for sharing on cold night."
"Dark ruby chestnut with a nice head of gap khaki foam. IT lasts a while and leaves some nice lacing. Aromas abound of fruit and spice, very festive, and this is a vintage bottle from 2003 we are dealing with hear, mind. Taste is all dark fruits, cream sherry, and some nuts blending together in a sweet malty diabetic alcoholic haze of flavor meld. Mouthfeel is sweet and viscous, drinkability remains high, but more than one 750 of this will put you in a sugar induced coma. Happy Holidays!"
"Handsome dark brown appearance, with initial pour thick foaminess. Creamy mouthfeel, goes down nicely. Great meal accompaniment. Well malted combination of spices: cinammon, allspice, pinch of pepper, chocolate. This bottle's age is unknown, I picked it up in Severn, NY, and I am sure by the dust it was already aged. And so the yeast was abated somewhat, it's in the creamy mix but not prominent. Wonderful."
"Unlike most Christmas beers that are usually a big amber or brown ale with a bunch of spices added, Affligem's is a beer brewed specifically with the nature of such spices in mind. Hazy brown with nice carbonation and proteins. Rests on natural spices already exhibited by Belgians. The added spices add not only spice flavor, but roundness, meldedness, and aged flavors without the sharpness usually shown in seasonals. Obvious spices added, but difficult to pinpoint the cinnemon, nutmeg, allspice, or any others. They come together well to contribute to the beer, not over power it."
"It pours a hazy tawny brown color with a tall billowy tan head. Aroma is complex and deep- cherries, plums, cloves, cinnamon, orange peel and nutmeg all seem to float on a platform of caramel and molasses. Some medicinal phenols are well hidden and integrated. The flavor is rich and dominated by the molasses and orange peel. The palate is full with sufficient bitterness and a warming sensation of alcohol. But what starts out as intriguing eventually becomes overbearing by the end of a 750ml., and those phenols become too prominent."
"D - An excellent Belgian Strong Dark Ale that could double as a Winter Warmer. Well crafted and very satisfying."
"Drinkability: Good. It's actually a lot lighter and in control than you'd expect a big-ass Christmas Belgian to be. And it IS big, don't let it fool ya. Still, if your liver can handle it, this is actually something you could drink quite a bit of."
"Aroma leans toward caramel malts, sweetbreads, rum-raisin, spice, candy sugar and white fruits..pear and apple. Color is a dark red/brown and the head is a firm, creamy two finger thick tan beauty. Flavor is moderately spicy with sweet malts and candy sugar some hints of toffee and apples. Mouthfeel is somewhat thinner than anticipated. The flavor concentration could be higher, but it has a good flavor range."
"Drinkability is higher than most Noel beers of this sort because it isnt overly sweet, spiced, or just plain candied citrusy."
"Drinkability- The great flavor makes it hard to not go for another 750ml bottle of this liquid magic. But the abv. makes it tricky to have another bottle in one day without taking a nap in between."
"I have been cellaring this bottle since September and it was worth the wait! Very smooth and well-balanced. If you can find it, it's a great brew to split with a friend."
"Notes: In my experience this would be a run of the mill Belgian Stong Dark...which still makes it a great beer as the style is phenominal. To be average is an accomplishment in itself."
"Drinkability: Very sophisticated holiday seasonal; a great offering to include on the winter drinking list"
"This is an impressive brew. It seems to have stronger spice character than the typical Belgian dark. Very smooth and easy to drink. The only drawback is tha alcohol flavor makes this brew a little more harsh than I would like."
"Drinkability is good on this holiday treat. Thanks to Blakaeris for this cool holiday beer."
"Poured from a 750 into my new Chimay glass. Pours a cloudy brown with a 2 finger head, very good longevity and equally nice lace. Smells of chocolate, brown sugar, molasses, dried fruits and a bit of alcohol. Big tastes of ripe fruit mixed with spice, brown sugar, chocolate. Creamy and buttery. Alcohol comes through. A nice brew but sip this one or it will get ya."
"750 ml. Good price, good brew. Sweet, but well balanced. Tastes like a good dubbel. Not spicey like I have come to expect from a Noel, but a tasty, creamy brew nonetheless. Nothing to stand out, but quite drinkable. Reminded me a bit of Ommegang. Worth a try, especially at this price ($6.99)."
"Full mouth with slight residuals, very drinkable until the abv gets on top of you."
"Overall: Nice, nice stuff, especially at the five bucks a bottle I shelled out for it."
"Really not that much has changed in 2 plus years. Maybe a touch more sweet caramel malt. Carbonation is just as brisk and still retains all of it's dark fruity goodness. Probably wouldn't change my rating though."
"Smells are subtle- sweet, berries, a hint of chocolate. Nice, though. Taste is similar to the nose, with more candy notes, and it reminds me a bit of a good red wine. The mouthfeel is good, not too thick, not too watery, a good amount of bubbles, no bad aftertaste. It's quite drinkable, especially for 5 bucks, but probably too sweet after a while. A tasty brew."
"I'll look out for this one again, even if it costs more."
"Marvellous offering from Affligem, perhaps their best beer."
"Great Belgian Christmas beer that usually won't break the bank. I liked this beer a lot. Pours a rich dark brown and has a nice dark fruit nose, maybe some figs in there? Taste is smooth, lots of dark fruits, plums, etc and some subtle spicing. Nice warming sensation. Good carbonation and head retention. One of the better Christmas ales I had this season (it was a 2004 vintage). I think it'd be great with a year or so in the cellar as well."
"Drinkability: Although this used to by one of my favorite beers, and I did drink this at basement room temperature (about 60F), and although it may have lost some cache with my palette with this version, it is still a very good Belgian beer. My hopes is that they 're-beef' it up again."
"Overall Impression 4.5: Crushingly drinkable, only playful hints at the 9% monster that lurks within. Truly a great winter/Christmas beer that gets much better with some aging."
"Very dark brown hazy body, ruby red in color when light is held to the glass. Really big head, tan and foamy, fades to an uneven rocky surface. Smell is pure beligian. Spicy and woody, slightly musty, with plenty of alcohol aromas. Taste is very alcoholic, spicy and earthy with plenty of hops on the fade. A nice big beer for the winter months. I am celebrating the Super Bowl with this stuff, which I would be celbrating like Chriitsmas if the Vikings were still in seaon. Good stuff, get it."
"The holidays are over, but winter is not. Large bottle, caged and corked. Opened with a flourish of escaping energy, poured with a vigorous head, leaving a puffy, fluffy head, leaves the expected respectable sticky lacing. Dark almond in color, cloudy. Nose is of ripe fruit. This is a tasty, warming ale. Lots of yeasty, bready goodness. Slightly prickly on the tongue. As it warms, notes of clove, yeast, licorish, and smoke come foward. Very nice winter brew, lacking the depth of complexity of the higher rated BSDAs, but still well worth a try."
"Murky brown, orange shades displaying a generous off-white head. Plain fruits (banana, dates, plums) aroma, yeasty pudding flavors, fluffy character. Sweetness delicately balanced by a tart rhubarb-like layer and cinammon. Perhaps a slight vegetal tone. Highly carbonated, almost bubbly though not disturbing. Pineapple bite in the finish. Good, answers the usual christmas beer anticipation, if not as spicy as some. A solid all-around 4"
"Taste was very nice. No huge flavor hit you because its blended so well that you get a hit of all the flavors at once. Fruity, Sweet bread and malts. Beautfiully balanced. The alcohol was never present in the noise or taste, even as it warmed up. Not typical of a noel as more spice tends to be the major player. I thouroughly enjoyed this one and would buy it again for sure."
"Overall, this is a very tasty Belgian, one that gives me a nice warm feeling. Even though it's well after Xmas, this is a nice winter's treat for me."
"Nice presentation; rich brown-amber color, decent carbonation with a cream -colored head that stays around for much of the duration. Also a fair amount of lacing as the level drops. Very subtle aroma; yeasty, not in the least overwhelming. Flavor seems to improve as the beer warms (or maybe as I get closer to the end of the bottle!). Hints of raisins, malty, with little in the way of hops. Very drinkable Belgian; I'll have to make this something of a Christmas tradition!"
"($7.19 / 750ml / 25.4 oz corked and caged champagne style bottle)"
"I have not had this beer in about 7 years, and I remember it fondly as being one of those beers that I looked forward to picking up every holiday season. It is about how I remember it, rich, sweet and chewy, perfectly appropriate for a cold winter evening. It is not the most complex beer but it hits the spot. Nothing in particular is stunning about this beer, but the combination leaves me with a great beer sitting in my Tulip glass. Cheers and happy new year."
"750 ml bottle, corked and bailed. If the beer did not have so much alcohol presence it probably would do more in the drinkability department."
"Overall, I was a bit underwhelmed by this beer. The malt and caramel sweetness was laid on too thickly and the alcohol content was too thinly disguised for my liking. Still, not a bad way to end a Christmas day."
"(I've only gotten halfway through this bottle and I suspect that I'll like it more as I drain the thing...yup, it's happening...yum, this is the epitome...boy, oh, boy, how can you get any better?)"
"This is a remarkably smooth beer. While a winter warmer, this beer is very easy to drink. This beer has it all--fruit, spice, sweetness and alcohol--all that blend nicely in this delicious Christmas ale."
"Recommended for the Holiday season - July 4th to Easter..."
"Very drinkable. Got on sale for $5.99 so QPR goes way up."
"A real sipping and warming brew, perfect for Christmas it is READY to mull straight from the bottle."
"Draught: This one is a dark amber color. It was also fairly clear with a minimal amount of head. the aroma has a bit of malts, with some spices and maybe some dark fruits. A somewhat spicy taste to go along with their typical sweetness. This was actually quite nice for a standard bar beer."
"Sedimented and opaque, a burnt umber overall color. Yellowish head of bubbles tending to larger sizes, rises to a good inch in the glass. Fat dots and strings for laces. Smells of candied pear, lots of cinnamon comes through in the aroma. Medium body and carbonation, nicely composed. Treacle flavors, yeasty background, but establishing a malty overall tone, embellished by a peachiness. Nice sense of balance, hops are peppery and somewhat background in impression, but combined with a lively mouthfeel and a menthol sense and a building alcohol warming. Well-done and nicely complex, the beer takes on a candy-like impression as its temperature rises, you can really taste this characteristic by licking your lips."
"Pours to brownish-ruby color with a thick, creamy tan head. Leaves a lot of lacing down the glass. The aromas are of brown sugar, malts, yeast, and some dark fruits. It is a bit yeasty and herbal as well. The flavor is malty sweet with brown sugar, and an herbal taste. It has a slight dark fruitiness as well. It is smooth and creamy in texture with a semi-sweet finish. This is one tasty Belgian brew."
"Really quite a yummy beer. A classic big Belgian perfect for the holidays or just sipping any day of the week."
"Pours an auburn color around the edges with woody colors in the middle. Large head that settles quickly leaving a thin layer of foam along the top. Smell is yeasty, slightly fruity, and slightly spicy. Taste has a strong spice precense. Maybe some ginger and orange peel, but the orange peel is subdued. Taste reminds me of gingerbread cookies. Sweetness is very sweet like molasses but its not strong enough. Body is decent but its mostly comprised of spice and alcohol, which is fairly noticeable. Needs a little more substance in the middle. Hops appear toward the end but are faint, the finish is strong spice. Overall a good beer, but im happy with one."
"The beer after its extrication from the 750ml bottle pours a slightly beclouded burnt umber color with a modest semi-creamy light tan head that upon its demise leaves a thick and clingy blanket of lace upon the glass. Nose is plum like with nice sweet malt back round, crisp and fresh to the senses; start is somewhat sweet with a nice malt presence and the top middling in its feel to the palate. Finish is prickly in its acidity and the hops spicy in their bite; the 9 percent ABV leaves a nice warm feeling in the tummy, a quite nice beer. This one I share with the Veterans, past present and future, and especially to those who gave the ultimate sacrifice."
"This beer just became available in Arizona and is great. Split a bottle of it at Papago Brewing this past weekend. Color was a nice dark amber color. The beer was malty sweet but not cloying like many Belgian beers can be. You could tell that there were spices in it but they didn't overpower it, just making a great balanced spiced Christmas beer. Aroma was of malt, no hops. I'm going to put it on my Christams wish list and stick a couple bottles away to age another year."
"A decent brew for the style."
"This is a well flavored but ultimately very commercial beer. This much alcohol and spice should be accompanied with some real viscosity and chew. Unfortunately shortcuts pay the bills."
"This was a wonderful ale, and I regret that I have not been able to find it again. One I would certainly like to have again, as it has been some time."
"Pellucid deep ruby hue. Mountainous, steadfast, fluffed light bister head yields coating lace. Gorgeous. Upfront in aroma is an egalitarian mélange of fresh grated cinnamon, orange peel and floral, nectar like esters. As it warms trace bubblegum and clove add subtle candylike and herbal tones, respectively. Judiciously spiced and welcoming aromawise. In flavor, incipient is a transient, citric, lemon like acidity. It is ensued by a dubbelesque combination of raisin, carob and yeast derived must. Spicing is agreeably understated and complementary. Mellow ground coriander melds with the sweet, woody undertone to lend a sandalwood smoke impression. The taste reminds me of the aroma of the markets in Riyadh I used to go to as a kid. Lightly bodied and surprisingly rather dry, but superbly quaffable as a result. Becomes more honey like in its malt character, while carob and dark fruit notes diminish as it breathes. Residual sweetness never becomes cloying. Finishes soft, with trace dark malt and hop bitterness lingering parallel with dilute orange sweetness. A delicious, complex brew that sits dangerously light on the palate. Akin to a traditional dubbel / spiced dark strong hybrid. Outstanding. I should've cellared this for longer. Bottled 10/03."
"Merry Christmas to me!"
"IMHO: A decent beer, but overdone on the hop astringency bit. Not well balanced."
"I liked this Belgian style beer more than some of the others I've tried because it wasn't as yeasty and citrusy as they were."
"This is a great beer. In my mind this is the way a beer should look when you pour it in the glass. Great color, thick foamy head that laces down the glass nicely. Feels good on the tongue and is very drinkable. I would like to kick back a few of these in a single sitting but the price and high ABV (which is barely noticeable) make that difficult to do. This is a beer that I buy a bottle of whenever I see it."
" Note: This one came out a bit cold, but it really thrived when it warmed (more so than other brews)."
"Huge, coarse, maple-tan, hilly head on top of a deep, garnet, clear beauty. Foamy, clump, thick lacing. The smell is sweet candy, fruity grapes and a little yeasty toffee. Nice. Sweet, sweet grapes and alcohol give way to a tangy, sweet, fruity, full, creamy middle. Alcohol in the finish and some nice bready grains surprise me. This is just a nice, strong, sweet, fruity Belgian. Perfect for Christmas."
"75cl bottle cork dated 10/02. Poured an attractive ruby red color with a tight thick head that had some staying power. Aroma is a classic Belgian one of fruity malt, yeast and candy sugar. Very nice aroma. Body is medium and crisply effervescent. Flavor not as good as aroma unfortunately. Has some metallic issues with a fruity malt flavor. Just average in that department. Finishes slightly dry and tart. Overall not a bad one, just nothing really interesting to me."
"Pours a copper/maroon color with golden highlights. Decent head retention and grat lace on the glass. Aroma was candy sugar, coriander, hint of cinnamon, dark malts, yeast and dark bread. Flavors that I found were a deep malt finish with a hint of cinnamon, a biscuity nad buttery middle and yeasty and spicy finish. Very complex flavors that really worked well together as the beer warmed. Mouthfeel was ""chewy"" and alive with slight dryness on the back end. Very tasty and very warming beer. I drink this on draught all night (and the pass out)."
"Having had this beer before, I knew I was going to enjoy it. Immensely rewarding, it produces tight foam bubbles that persist almost until the glass is empty, Fresh smells of corrinder and or other spices are present, but take a backround to the tast, which is sweet with an underlying bitterness tha balances this beer out wonderfuly. As big as this beer is, (and high in alcohol), it's so smooth. Great choice for a Belgian X-mas beer."
"The flavor was full of malt and yeast, with a light balance of bitterness. Reminds me of a big brother to an abbey dubbel.The mouthfeel was smooth and a bit of crispness was noticed on the tongue due to the high carbonation level. The malt rides the tongue long into the aftertaste. Quite drinkable as the high alcohol level is not as noticable as in some other xmas ales."
"Pours a cloudy brown color with a good size head that seems to last and last. The smell is sweet with hints of figs, raisins and nuts. The taste is great. There is no trace of any alcohol notes at all. Although, I would say this is about at it's prime. The carbonation is starting to get very high and it is picking up some smokey notes. I don't see how this beer could improve any more. It could only drop off in terms of quality. It held up well. I think that I will save a Corsendonk Christmas for next year."
"750 ml bottle, corked and caged. Aged for a year and a half (dated on the cork 6/02). A huge head of creamy light-tan foam resides over a dark chestnut body that teems with streaming effervescent carbonation. When held to the light, the clear brownish body displays ruby and brass highlights. The head retention is excellent, and it leaves wide creamy rings and craggy splashes of lace throughout the entire glass. And although the nose remains quite contained beneath its creamy cap, a distinct candy-ish character, some mustiness, dark fruit, and a touch of toffee come through. In the mouth, its very fine and natural (bottle-conditioned) carbonation warms to become quite airy, giving its light-medium body a bit of a bigger feel, and it passes across the palate with a quick zest that becomes pillowy soft & smooth before it reaches the throat. The flavors reflect the aroma with a candyish malt that's tempered by some sublime phenols and peppery spice. A touch of herbal hops and some minimal drying alcohol rounds it out. Along the way some subdued dark fruit, some nuttiness, and even a hint of cocoa appear; yet it finishes dry and powdery. Impressive! It's bold without being overwhelming, and it never builds on the palate. The alcohol is well-heeled and it finishes clean. This is a really nice beer to enjoy at a quite time during the holiday season, but I don't think it's subtle complexities can really be enjoyed within a party atmosphere."
"Pours a ruby color with a nice amount of head and leaves a decent amount of lacing on the glass. The aroma is of sweet malts and fruits. The flavor is a little sweet with some malts and a nice bit of spices to make it interesting. It has a thick mouthfeel and I thoroughly enjoyed it."
"This is one of _those_ beers. You know, the ones where you take your first sip and say ""Hey, this is pretty good!"" and by the time you're done with your first glass you're ready to give the brewmaster a kidney. The taste is big, smooth, round, and buttery. If I had one word to describe it, it would be ""sumptuous"". It's not tremendously complicated, but it's constructed so well - out of just a few perfectly-tooled elements - that it brings to mind a masterfully carved piece of woodwork. Incredibly smooth despite its richness, it sweeps over my palate like a thick sheet of velvet. This is one exceptional beer. I'll be getting a bunch of this and aging it for next Christmas."
"A fantastic winter offering. A nice yet uncloying sweetness combined with an unnoticable alcohol leads to a drink with a deceptive goodness to it. Quite good, and on the short list for Christmas in years to come."
"Whaddya mean you want me to put the tree topper on top of the tree? I still have half of a glass of Affligem left! Can't it wait? You sure you want me to put on a 40 year old ornament after a fifth of 9% brew? Ohhh-kayyyy... it's your mom's ornament!! (sounds of nothing crashing) Ahhh, now back to my brew..."
"Rich ruby brown color with a decent tan head. Aromas of malt, some Christmasy-type spices and a trace amount of hops. Big malt taste, and, of course, some candi sugar of the dark variety, finishing clean and smooth with the spice showing up again in the finish. Candied raisins, trace amount of anise in there, too. A small bit of astringency, but definitely not off or overbearing. I liked this beer a great deal last year and this year's no exception. A mighty fine winter seasonal."
"Cork was dated 6/03 so this bottle was moderately fresh but I would imagine this beer would only improve with age."
"Tons of pears, apples, cinnamon, sweet malts, yeast, caramel, dried orange peels and alcohol. I really enjoyed this!"
"ng"
"Poured from a caged and corked 750 ml. bottle, it's a beautiful mahogany with a thick head that lingers to the end. Dark fruit and spice with noticeable yeast make for a wonderful smell. The taste is just as nice: complex and fascinating. Peppery flavors play nicely against the taste of raisin and cherry. With fairly high carbonation, the mouthfeel is nice and chewy. As for drinkability, the 750 was gone before I knew what happened. This is a beautiful beer and one I'll revisit as we get even closer to Christmas."
"Pours a deep reddish brown with a huge foamy head,aroma is very malty and sweet like candied sugar and juicy fruit.Taste is of dried fruit and sweet candied sugar with some light smokiness that liners.A very rich somewhat complex brew good for after dinner like me right now."
"Gee, is that bottle empty already ?"
"Update - Tried a 2008 right off the shelf and it definitely needed some time in the cellar, so I would suggest at least a year to get your money's worth out of this wonderful ale."
"Dark brown color, medium white head, creamy and very thick. Aroma is malty and a little spicy. Full-bodied Belgian Ale. Malty and slightly sweet. Typical Belgian yeastiness and fruitiness, orange, dates, raisins and chocolate. Spices come through all these flavors to add too a really nice tasting beer. Very smooth taste. High alcohol is warming without any typical alcohol bite. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly bitter and somewhat malty."
"Red/Brown color. Rich thick lasting inviting light brown head. The head is sticky and clingy on the sides of the goblet. Rich caramel sweet malt and fruity yeast nose. Mellow soft flavor starts out sweetly with a soft caramel marshmellow taste which is then cut well by a sturdy yeast and hop bitterness on the tongue. Very balenced. A well rounded brew that is sweet upfront with a nice backbone of hops and spice in the finish. Wonderful smooth as silk mouth. WOW what a mouth. A very smooth rounded subtile drinkable beer esp. at 9%. Cheers to Jay V for this present during the holiday season! It won't be the last time I drink this beer!"
"This big beautiful 2002 Christmas Seasonal is pouring a nice burnt umber (reddish brown). The head is thick and lively with a wide variety of bubble sizes that eventually settles to a moderate head leaving lace down the sides of the glass. The nose is mild spiced malt. The taste is sweet malt, and strong hops with a distinctive alcohol flavor. There is a pleasant and subtle spice to this and notes of citrus. Overall a better than fair seasonal but not the best one I have had."
"Comments: This has to be one of my all time favorites. If I could live on this beer alone, I would. It is to be treasured. As the tag that came with the bottle says, ""Brewed to be Shared."" Thank you Stu (from Shoreline Beverage on Long Island) for recommending this to me. After having this one bottle, I went back and bought the other three that he had left."
"NB: I saved the second half of this bottle with a Vacu-Vin and finished it almost exactly 24 hours later. Flavors filled out just a bit and carbonation was remarkably preserved. Over-poured it, thinking that carbonation level would be down, and ended up with a huge cap of foam!"
"Pours a slightly hazy mahogony brown color, with a massive thick and creamy tan head, heavy carbonation, and lots of broken lace. Spicy and potent aroma of alcohol and dark fruit. Taste begins with rich malt flavor, cloves, cinnamon, and a surge of stinging carbonation, gives way to strong pepper and alcohol notes, finishing with bitter chocolate and strong hops. The alcohol is quite warming and very potent, devastatingly so. An absolutely superior beer - one of the best I have ever had."
"Dark mahogany brown color, two fingered off-white head that is very thick and creamy. Aroma of musty cork and vinous undertones with bigger aromas of chocolate and tropical fruit as it warms up. Flavor is a brilliantly evenhanded mix of caramel, dates, raisins, chocolate bitter orange, and spiciness. A good amount of yeast as well let alone the big warming alcohol that holds faint solvent and tropical fruit in the back. A full bodied and rounded brew, a dollop of residual sweetness. Creamy on the tongue. A sipping brew to have with some holiday dessert, one of the many winter seasonals that should be on your list."
"Poured a reddish brown with a light brown foam. The smell had a malty aroma with a hint of spicies. The taste was creamy and malty with a hint of spicies also. I would not buy this brew again, but it was nice the first time!"
"Hazy Orange-brown color, huge frothy head that leaves a clingy lace in the glass, sweet bready floral aroma, sweet caremel malty flavor, nice light bitterness in the finish, medium body with a pleasant creamy mouthfeel, a great seasonal ale."
"I dont want an Aston Martin DB7 GT anymore; just leave me a Crate of Affligem Noël instead."
"427"
"Pours a dark brown, almost black. Nice aroma of fruits, plum, raisons, and the taste to match. Tart, sweet, malty, almost bread like mouthfeel and nice, crisp, dry finish. Very drinkable, very nice brew. Did I mention very drinkable? Yeah, worth trying!"
"This beer poured a dark amber color and formed a light tan bubbly head that left some circular lace. A good amount of carbonation is present. The aroma is of malt, cinammon, chocolate and some other spices. A flavor of malt, chocolate and spice. A slightly tart finish due to the carbonation."
"Foamer. Murky brown color with a slight ruby hue to it. Super charged beige head. Excellant seasonal aroamas spicy nutmeg, cinnamon, chocolate and everything else. Nice super smooth taste. Starts with all the spices up front but very sublte. Nutmeg Cinnamon, chocolate and yeasty belgian goodness combine with a very soft roasted fruit plum taste. Finish is a nice and rich, very balanced with a hot spicy flash of warming alcohol. Vey rich, perfectly balanced, moderately carbonated. Consistent flavors beginning to end. One of the best Christmas beers yet. Go find this one."
"Pours with a lasting and vigorously effervescent light tan head that settles over clear ruby-red liquid. Nose is yeasty, fruity, chocolatey, malty, with alcoholic notes. Taste is rich, sweet & warming, with raisiny notes mixed with chocolate, hop bitterness and spiciness...nice and complex on the palate. Finish is warm and delicious! A superb sipping ale that no doubt would kick my ass if consumed in any quantity larger than a 750ml. bottle. One Xmas beer you should be on the lookout for!"
"This has been aging for a little over a year (Date on cork says 10/01), so I pulled it out to give it a taste. Let me start off by saying, I thoroughly enjoyed this beer. It poured out a nice reddish brown with good clarity and ample head that soon diminished to a thin layer. The nose was rich and sweet with a great fruit cake aroma. Sip after sip revealed an ambrosia of sweet fruit and rich malt. The finish was suprisingly dry with peppery notes way in the background. Carbonation was prevalent but fine and champagne like helping produce a smooth and satisfying mouthfeel. A warming alcohol character was also present and quite pleasing, especially during these colder month. Great beer for the season. Eager to try this years iteration."
"Very smooth with a lovely deep reddish color. I'm not good at describing all of the flavors and nuances of different beers, but this was an incredible brew imho. Nice thick head and left nice trails down the glass. Had an almost peppery finish to it on the back of the palate. Great beer at a reasonable price."
"Excuse the weak technical review here, but I had this beer after I had already had many other fine beers, guests were over, Christmas songs were on, dinner was served and I couldn't have picked a better beer to go with the festive atmosphere.  It was simple exceptional.  Merry Christmas."
