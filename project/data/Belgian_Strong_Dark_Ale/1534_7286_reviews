"Pours very dark. This is a strong dark ale."
""

"To licorice'ish for me. Better Christmas ales out there."
"Taste is sweet but mostly dominated by licorice. mouthfeel is medium to full."
""
""
""
"An anise flavour I don`t like"
"good xmas beer a little heavy on the liquorice though"
""
"If it didn't taste like a soda maybe I would like it."
"One of the best Christmas beers. And I'm not a fan of licorice and many other Christmas spiced ales."
"Beautiful color...deep amber brown with an average head of large bubbles.  Nose is underwhelming with some stale euro hops, malt, allspice, and stale raisins.  Taste is better with full sweet malt and very good mouthfeel...a hint of licorice and dates, and some warmth from the ABV.  Overall, not as good as I was hoping for, but reasonable for the price."
""
""
"Overall:  Goddamn, this is an absolutely awesome beer, but not quite as AWESOME as the aged 2011.  I love the strong flavors of the dried fruit and candied sugar, which is balanced perfectly with the malt and yeast.  Absolutely delicious!"
""
"Deep broown colour, with red reflections to the light. Medium beige head that does not hold for too long, but leaves a good lace. Smell of earth, spices, maybe pepper, vanilla, cinnamon, clove, dried fruits, candy, anis, licorice...  Medium body and carbonation, it felles great in the palate, creamy and rich. Taste of licorice, dried fruits, clove, vanilla, cinnamon, caramel. Great."
""
""
""
"Overall: One of the most delicious ""holiday"" beers I've ever had. I will buy this again next December."
""
""
""
"WTF is this? I'm not shure if I like it or hate it... Not what I expected. Almoust like a big bottle of Jägermeister. Well I have to decide... For this money you can buy great beer - This is not great, it is strange... I don't want strange... So conclusion - Buy something else!"
""
"Mouthfeel: Full bodied, with a warming boozy finish."
""
"overall: Great beer. Had this lined up for Christmas eve and we never got to it. Wish we had."
""
"Cheers."
"Heavy notes of fig newton and black licorice."
""
"I really enjoyed this beer, but I'm hesitant to seek it out bottled based on what I'm seeing from others. If not, we'll always have the Hopleaf. Hoping it's back on draft there next winter."
""
"The ""peppermint"" flavor threw me a bit.  This beer is a tad confusing, it has some good things going for it, but also some iffy notes."
"Can't get past the menthol I taste. A bit disappointed with this."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I’ve heard that this beer is really hot when it is young.  I can’t say because this aged beauty was my first try.  I can say that I definitely liked the four-year old version quite a bit."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a very good beer that I enjoyed a lot."
"Had this on draft last night. I enjoyed it. 3.75-4. It didn't blow me away but it was tasty. Very solid for the style. Definitely something I'd order again, though this isn't my favorite style and I'm not overly crazy about Belgian beers."
""
""
"Poured a dark reddish brown with a sparse tan head that faded immediately to a thin film. The aroma is sweet, with lots of licorice, some dark fruit notes and some spiciness. The taste is licorice and more licorice, with some cherry, raisin, figs, and kind of a ""winey"" taste. The mouthfeel is medium to light, with a bit of alcohol burn, very little carbonation.  It seems like there's a lot of different flavors in this beer, but they aren't melded well. Not the best Christmas Ale out there, but a solid drinker nonetheless."

"Brown and not bad flavor going down. However, licorice aftertaste is terrible. I feel like I'm drinking Jagermeister. No thanks."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I found balance in the beer with touches of bread like malt and yeast so no too sweet and has a mild finish thanks to well hidden booze."
""
"Sweeter than I had hoped, but the complex ester character is phenomenal. Still boozy and warming, this could probably age a few more years. Some oxidized sherry notes would counter the sweetness well, if they developed. The longer this beer lingered open, the better it got. Slightly tart sherry notes came out more, making it much less cloying."
""
"The anise and clove hit you immediately on this one. Bottle date is August 2013 so it has aged quite a bit. Abv says 10.5 but seems closer to 12. Very smooth and abc doesn't hit you you until 1/2 way. Certainly more of a Christmassy beer but had to open 1 of 2 I had. Glad I did."

"MF – Medium-bodied, some alcohol warmth in the finish and lasting on the palate, not solventy but close. 3.75"

"Paired well with the chicken, mashed potatoes and beer-based gravy on a cold day, if you ask me, and I’d gladly drink it again. Quite strong, however, so be prepared!"

"Taste-Sweetly spiced figs, raisins, plums, anise. Very rich and smooth for strength. A bit on the sweetish side for my taste. A slow sipper."

"750 ml bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 8/6/2012. Pours lightly cloudy very dark reddish brown color with a 2 finger dense khaki head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with moderate streaming carbonation. Aromas of big raisin, cherry, plum, prune, fig, licorice, molasses, toast, candi sugar, brown bread, herbal, light clove, and yeast earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great complexity and balance of dark malt/candi sugar and fruity yeast ester notes; with good strength. Taste of big raisin, plum, prune, cherry, fig, licorice, molasses, candi sugar, toast, herbal, light pepper, clove, and yeast earthiness. Lingering notes of raisin, plum, prune, fig, cherry, licorice, molasses, toast, candi sugar, pepper, light clove, herbal, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible balance and complexity of dark malt/candi sugar and fruity/spicy yeast ester flavors; with a great malt/yeast balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a moderately slick, smooth, and slightly syrupy mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is an outstanding Belgian strong dark ale. All around awesome complexity and balance of dark candi sugar malt and fruity/spicy yeast ester flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the big ABV. A highly enjoyable offering."

"Great beer! For Me definitely something to reserve for the cold weather. It definitely has a holiday flair to it. My friends took a taste and they said they'd drink it year round. Not a year round beer for me personally but delicious nonetheless. An herbal and licorice flavor is prominent. Cheers"
""
"O: A delicious combination of fruit flavors, though perhaps not as christmasy as some other winter abbey ales."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this isn't my favorite style. The licorice flavor just overwhelmed the rest though my second bottle a couple weeks later wasn't so overwhelming. Only my third strong dark belgian so experience is limited. Like Delirium Tremens much better."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I tend to avoid Christmas style beers but this is a very good one. The spiced tones are done well without completely taking over this brew. Outstandingly drinkable especially at 10.5%."
""
""
""
"In honor of loving memories of a morning in Mechelen. I was stoked to get a 5-year old bottle of this at a very fair price @bottleworks. This is pretty spice forward, particularly clove, ginger, and mint. The body is a little on the light side - fading dark fruit and tempered alcohol. Not at the top of my list of belgian christmas ales, but still a sentimental favorite."

"Pours very dark brown almost black, 2.5 fingers width of tan head and a small amount of lacing. Aroma is heavy black licorice, anise , and peppery spice. Taste follows the nose with black licorice, but also has lots of dark fruits, a bit of clove spice and toffee. Mouthfeel is full bodied, heavier carbonation, no hint of ABV and good drinkability. Overall, a great BSD Christmas ale. I really enjoyed this one."
""
"Mild dusting of a head across the surface, dark tan brown, swiftly pulls back to the glass sides, the lacing streaks are quite thin but have some stick to them. Murky dark brown colored liquid with more of a yellow tint than anything else, not a lot of visible effervescence, nothing truly remarkable about how it looks. The nose offers licorice, cola, orange spice, lightly roasted chocolate, fig, date, banana and hint of green apple, pleasing for how it does not overdo the sweetness and stays openly knit and airy, finishes with lingering nutmeg, cinnamon and splash of witch hazel. Medium-bodied, for its relative sweetness and mouth grip it has decent fluidity. Carbonation is light but generally up to the task. Initially tastes like a root beer float. Vanilla, malted milk balls, ginger, licorice, orange citrus, Brazil nuts and butterscotch predominate. The fruit has a darker complexion here with prune and cherry trumping the date and fig, not really showing a lot of esters nor breadiness. Likewise, no boozy “heat” on display although you can feel it once a good portion of the bottle is gone. Gains peppery bite as it warms. Fashions a dry, punctuated finish which helps it marshal an argument for being a good food beer and not just an after dinner sipper."

"Pours a translucent dark brown with a thick tan head that lingers and laces well. The nose is of dark sweet malt with a hint of dark fruit and chocolate. Medium bodied and well carbonated. This beer is full of flavor that masks the 10% alcohol well. Extremely well balanced. The taste is dark malt, with chocolate undertones, blended with spice and licorice with a very slight alcohol finish. Finishes clean with a burst of dark malt against spice and alcohol. An excellent Christmas Ale. I just did a side by side against St. Bernardus Christmas ale, on 12/4/13. Gouden is far superior in terms of body, complexity and flavor."
"A nice Christmas ale, not the sweetest of the bunch, but still for people with a sweet tooth. Perfect for the season."
""
"Sweet tasting beer with nice carbonation."
""
"O: This is a great beer for the winter/holiday season - perfect for sipping along side the fireplace on a chilly. A very nice representation of the BSDA style, especially since it has strong dark fruit aromas/flavors but without very much sweetness."

"O- This was pretty bad. The anise, sweetness and vinous flavors are all in the wrong proportions, and produce a beer that doesn't fit together and isn't fun to drink. Pass."
""
"Pours very dark brown, some maroon hints and a layer of foam. Chocolate cherry nose, and other assorted fruits. Cola too. Sweet belgian candi sugar taste but balanced well. Earthy hop close - not in a bitter sense, but in a flavored one. A bit boozy. Rich."
""
"O- Booze-bomb and it tastes like it."
"o: a very pleasant ale that, though high in alcohol content, is extremely drinkable brew. one to enjoy with friends on a cold winter evening."
""
"Pouring a very dark brown, black almost, with reddish brown highlights, this beer is capped with a dense, light brown head with excellent retention and very nice lacing. The nose is a spice bomb. A blend of mace, nutmeg and anise, with some eucalyptus, cola, mildly burnt sugar, this is a little too spiced for my liking. The cola notes here bring to mind discount sodas. Alcohol is reasonably well hidden. In addition, there's quite a bit of dark fruit present, with prunes and figs."

"First off, let me say that the cork is a nice touch. It pours a deep, beautiful, transparent Mahogony with a tan head. The head begins to recede, but never really dissapears. The lacing is exquisite. It holds for a second or two and then forms rivers and trubutaries through itself that all eventually lead to the sea of delectable belgian ale that lies below. The aroma carries warming notes of anise, dark fruit, yeast, and alcohol. The palate is very much like a nice glass of cabernet. It is a bit tart up front but then it rounds off nicely with rich notes of bread and anise. The anise carries over into the finish and joins yeast in a wonderful union of flavor. The carbonation is a little heavy, but its full mouthfeel counteracts it. It leaves a slight tackiness on the lips from it higher than average gravity. I usually frown upon this and I think that it is the downfall of many winter brew's, but somehow this beer makes it work. This beer forced a smile across my face from sheer joy."

"11.2oz. bottle served in my Gouden Carolus chalice. Lot number 12071 indicated on the back label. Pours a dull mahogany hue with a consistent, 1.5 inch, light tan head the sizzles and pops as it slowly recedes into a clumpy quarter inch cap. Nose suggests dark fruit, anise and orange Aspergum. Tastes pretty much like it smells - no real surprises here. There's also a slightly oxidized quality that comes out towards the finish. Mouthfeel is light-medium (but closer to light) with an even carbonation that falls just shy of being lively. There's also just a kiss of residual heat that lingers between quaffs as well as a slight acidity. Overall, not a bad example of the style, but not my favorite from this brewer. Not sure what a little age might do to this, but it might be worth laying down a bottle for a year or two."
"Overall- This is a rather nice Belgian Christmas brew. It has a decent boozy flavor, but yet is still very flavorful and pleasant to drink."
"The mouthfeel is on the heavier side with carbonation being about average for the style. Overall, I thought it was a very good holiday spiced beer. They didn't go overboard on the spices, which I appreciate. The dark fruit flavors were also particularly nice in it. It came together very well and is one of the better holiday spiced beers I've had in a while."

"Overall, a nice Belgian strong Christmas ale, but probably not my favorite (Corsendonk, Delirium or St B). The licorice notes were a little offputting for me. Nevertheless a relatively complex and well-assembled ale. I recommend letting it warm to 50 - 55F."
"The beer manager at Total Wine & More loves Belgian beers. He likes this one and the Gouden Carolus Easter. This is better than the Easter offering. But they are both good beers. We drank this one cold, but it has been sitting out for a good thirty minutes. If you have the chance to try this, get two. Throw one in the cellar for a few years… because this beer will only mellow out with time. Hands down the best Christmas offering of 2012. Can’t wait to try this again next year!!!"
""
"O: I was let down with this one. The licorice was way too powerful and the customary flavors were faint and hidden. Once it warms it become much easier to drink but is still far from great. A hot mess of a BSDA that is not one to hunt down."
""
""
""
""
""
""

""
""
"Overall a fantastic brew, this one really hits the spot on Christmas night. I love licorice and this beer has that flavor in plenty, but if you're not a licorice fan it has much else to recommend it."
"Merry Christmas to all, and to all a good night!"
""
"The taste is like a fruity barleywine with lots of alcohol-enhanced malts, sweetness, and a kind of dark fruit juiciness with a slightly lingering finish. Something I will remember."
""
""
"O-a solid beglain dark ale with spices. Its dangerously drinkable at 10%. Either its so well balanced out, or I can't detect it as easily anymore. I have other favorites out there when it comes to xmas ales (corsendonck probably still being my favorite), but this holds up pretty well. A bit disappointed, however, being that I really enjoyed this brewery's kaiser blue I had too high expectations"
""
""
"Pours a dark amber with a one and a half finger off-white head. Above average retention and abundant lacing. The nose is complex, some orange peel, boozy, rum-soaked burnt raisins, light earthiness and a bouquet of spices. Caramel and vanilla notes right off the bat, prunes, date, dried black cherries join in complemented by brown sugar, anise and ginger. Finishes semi-dry with warming alcohol. Smooth, silky, light syrupy mouthfeel, low carbonation. Overall a very nice holiday brew. Throughly enjoyed this one and won't hesitate to revisit it next year."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: at first I did not like this and then when I started to think about what I was smelling and tasting then, I started to like this ale. After all I love a good stick of black licorice but, this strong of licorice in beer ..."
"Will be enjoying this one again next christmas."
""
""
""
"This beer is incredibly unique and it's hard to say I've had anything quite like it before. TONS of flavors in the aroma and on the palate, I'm sure I missed a ton of stuff even. Super complex and ever-evolving, this one gets even better as it reaches 60 F. Certainly a treat, might be too powerful to have more than one, but that one should be savored and handled delicately."
""
""
""
""
""
"A warming ale for sure but the licorice was a bit strong for me."
"O - fruitcake in a bottle - everything from Het Anker is a malt bomb - this is no exception, but there is a ton of spice to provide balance and contrast - the complexity is what makes this beer"

"Pours a murky dark brown with a foamy tan head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Foamy rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, medicinal spices, and licorice. Taste is much the same with a licorice flavor on the finish. There is a mild amount of spice bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer with some nice aromas and flavors that make it easy to drink."
"Overall the Gouden Carolus Noël represents a decent Christmas beer. There are better and there are certainly worse. Though on tap this beer was not the best, the flavors that emerged from that serving far outweigh the cloudiness of tastes that take over after aging."
""
""
""
"Beer is medium to medium-heavy bodied, with medium level carbonation that is rather ""soft."" Alcohol is fairly well felt, warming and mild burning along the tongue, nostrils, and back of the throat. Aside from the ethanol, the beer is pleasant to sip, the mouthfeel being smooth and pillowy, aside from the heat of the fusel alcohols. Finish is semi-dry with little remaining stickiness."
""
""
"I've had this in years past, but found it pretty unexciting this time around. I've only had it on draft before and found it to be more enjoyable in that format (or at least from what I can remember). I'll have to buy and drink a fresh bottle next winter and see how it compares."
""
""
""
"This is a big/sweet monster. The anise flavor is almost overwhelming, but the overall complexity of the yeast and other sugars dials this one in for me. It is very sweet and more of a nightcap or dessert beer, but I really enjoy it. I'll buy this one each Christmas time, and I even was inspired to brew something quite similar."
"The palate opens with the mildly burnt sugar and cola being most noticeable, with the spices following. Again, the dominant notes are mace and nutmeg, with a little bit of clove and cinnamon thrown in. The burnt sugar does pair well with the fruity notes, making this rather dessert-like.The mid-palate is moderately sweet, with buckwheat honey, more cola and a mildly minty alcohol note. A little sweet yet drying on the finish with lingering burnt sugar, cola and mace, this beer is medium bodied and has a nice, creamy carbonation. One thing I haven't mentioned yet is the yeast, which adds a mildly bubblegum-like flavor. The flavors here are nice, but really, not quite for my palate. Recommended, this is one of those beers where the whole is better than the sum of the parts (and hence, my overall score of 4 despite the S/T/M being 3.5s)"

"A nice beer with conversation or reading. Late peppery notes lend themselves to compliment a sirloin in this excellent holiday beer."
"It's not a bad beer and it's something I could drink a couple of an not be disappointed, but there are some rough edges to prevent it from being a really good beer."
""
"I know 5's are supposed to be rare, but I truly believe, personally, that for me this beer could not be improved. It's an awesome beer, I'd easily buy a case to keep on hand for friend and family occasions."
""
"Overall a very tasty brew, definitely fits the mode of the style. Glad i had a chance to try it!"
""
""
"Two year old cellared bottle. Poured into an Ommegang flute. Pours a very dark red brown. Half finger fine light tan head with good retention and nice lacing. Looks good. Aroma of dark fruits, sweet dark malt, cherry and brown sugar with the dark sugar dominant. Delicious dark and light fruit, malt with the typical aged malt component. The sour fruit flavor has attenuated and blended in the the dark fruits and dark malts. Nicely integrated now. Full bodied and creamy, complex and a delight to drink. This two year old aged bottle is still an excellent strong dark. I'm not sure if it has improved, but it doesn't matter much."
"Pours a dark rusty copper/brown color with minimal cap of khaki bubbles, little lacing. Strong notes of anise with notes of prune and fig lead with notes of brown sugar and light molasses. Taste leads with initial bite of spice from the anise, sweetness expected from the nose isn't as pronounced and gives a light pastry like quality - pizzelle cookies come to mind and peg the season perfectly. Rum soaked prune and fig on the back end and settles into a pleasant, lightly sweet brown sugar note. Medium bodied, could use a touch more heft to stand up to the bold flavors. Overall, pegs the season perfectly and quite unique with its flavor profile - only a few minor concerns with body and ability to drink more than 10oz or so."
"O: This beer is a good representation of the style and has good drinkability because it’s neither too fruity nor too sweet and has a nice malty backbone. It is a good selection so sip next to a fireplace on a cold winter night."
""
"First impressions when tasting was of a velvety smooth beer, any heaviness lifted by the carbonation, a great wet kiss of liquorice dominant in the mouth with a complex aftertaste, plenty of spice such as anise, cinnamon, plus sweet malt. Very pleasant, hardly notice the alcohol content and a real hit with the Badminton group."
""
""
""
"Overall not one of the best Belgium's I had on tap, sweet for sure but ABV was kind of noticeable."
""
""
""
""
"Fuller body, decent carbonation, a little chewy and soft on the tongue. Pretty much middle of the pack for the style here, but not bad."
"This is a very good sipping beer. I really enjoyed sipping it while watching the Jersey Shore. They paired well."
""
"O-this beer is going to age very well. Really good and smooth with lots of character and body. A really good beer and what I expected."
"D/O: This is a prime example of why I disagree with people who write reviews based on a 2-ounce pour. 2 ounces into this glass, and I was really digging the strong licorice notes. Half way through? I'd grown weary of it, it's imbalances became more noticable, and notes of banana started to show through as it warmed, which I really didn't think worked with this brew. Drinkability is not ""high"" here. I suppose I would be willing to revisit at some point, but this is far from a ""must have"" Christmas beer."
""
"Very much an interesting beer, it's a bit spicier than I expect for the style. There is no doubt this is a holiday beer, the smell and taste fit in perfectly with that time of year. A bit too strong to drink a lot of, but a good one to have on a cold night, it will warm you right up."
""
""
"A beer enjoyed more by myself in the past two years. It's been ramped back on the spices, but it still fits for what it is... a well-made Belgian Christmas beer."
""
"They trew a lot of 'anijs' in this beer and that makes this beer very nice to drink. Very soft and round drinkable."
"Overal a very nice Christmas beer."
"O: A fantastic example of holiday winter warmer. Who needs a fireplace when you can have a Carolus Noël?"
""
""
"O- Definitely a taste bud pleaser. Could not imagine attempting 3 of these. Atleast not if I were driving. YUM!"
""
"I’m yet to have anything close to a bad beer from Brouwerij Het Anker. That places brews high quality beer. Gouden Carolus Noël is exactly that. It’s deep, complex, and packed with flavor. It’s impressive. If you see a bottle around, grab one. You’ll thank yourself for it."
"Great Belgian Christmas beer. Just the right blend of traditional Belgian Strong Dark characteristics with the woody and spice notes one may expect from a Christmas brew."
""
"Overall a really nice strong dark ale that hits all the right sweet spots on Christmas Eve."
"Overall I like it, but I am not loving the orange taste. I really wanted to like this since I like Het Anker a lot, but this one just isn't grabbing me. After finishing the beer started to grow on me, it is very mellow and has a nice complexity to it."
""
"Overall - If you are not a fan of Christmas treats and toothaches, then perhaps this is not for you. A plethora of sweet notes, whiskey (wood and smoke), brown sugar and cherries with anise. As far as brewing goes, I am fairly confident that this is the Classic aged in wood barrels each year. I am not entirely sure if it is scotch or whiskey, but nonetheless, it is aged and perhaps a few more ingredients are thrown in as well. Amazing and festive. Love this beer!"
""
""
"Overall a delicious and enjoyable holiday brew, but I've had a few Belgian christmas offerings I'd pick before this. Still, nothing to turn your nose up at."
""
""
"Half finger light brown head, quick dissipation resulting in thin broken layer of head on top of dark brown body, several streams of slow rising bubbles visible around edge of glass. Stone fruit dominated nose, plums and currants, big dose of dark candi sugar, floral hops. Taste mirrors nose, more plums than currants or raisins, sweetness from the formidable dose of candi sugar, a bit of spice vanilla, floral hops not bitter. Mouthfeel is medium, decent effervescence. Wondering if this taste a bit more full in the big bottle, I preferred the St. Bernardus to this, might benefit from some aging."
""
""
""
"The beer appears dark chestnut brown with a formidable khaki head. Ample lacing and lasting head retention. The aroma offers malt, sweet spice, brown sugar, dark fruit, alcohol. Sweet breads, dark fruit, spices, malt, brown sugar, and Christmas cookies in the flavor. Quite sweet throughout - I am glad to be splitting this bottle. Licorice, candies, decadent holiday sweets, fruitcake. Complex and well done, though a bit cloying for my taste. The feel is thin to medium bodied with adequate carbonation. Overall, a bit too sweet, though well done and enjoyable. Best in small quantities."
""
""
"Overall nice except the earthy herbal tannic taste I'm not a fan of. Decent spices held in check, great almost barleywine malt profile, tasty and decent booze profile."

"there is just a bit too much heat on this one, and the minty spice is just overbearing, but damn is it something else."
""
""
"M: Even the alcohol is high in this beer the sensation is not bad, it start with some sweetness and changes slowly and smoothly into a little bittersweetness with a pronounced ending that remains long in the back of the mouth."
""
"Overall – You'd never know this beer had 10% alcohol. My bottle was best before Nov 2011, so I'm assuming it's been aged to some extent. It's so smooth and delicious. It's a perfect sipping beer for the holidays/colder weather."
""
"O - Overall I think it could use some aging, as the alcohol is pretty noticeable and seems to wash away the flavors off your tongue. I think the beer looks fantastic, and although the alcohol is a bit strong for my liking, I would buy this again and age it just a bit. Definitely recommended to Belgian brew fans. Cheers!"
"at 10% ABV, i like this more than i thought i would but it's, end the end, still a bit boozy for my preferences."

"Gouden Carolus Noel pours a dark mahagony color w/ a one finger perfect cocoa head. Great lacing on my snifter glass as well. Even when held to light, you can't really see anything other than orange highlights. The smell is fantastic. Fig, prune, raisin, licorice, and some spices are the main things I get. This beer smells like a holiday beer should. It's super complex, and just keeps getting better w/ every whiff. The taste is great too, just not to the same level- I'm nitpicking here. Huge malt backbone, w/ just the right amount of fruit, yeast, and spices. All melded into a giant cyclone of Christmas cheer. The only thing I can ding it on is that I'd like to have it be a little less sweet. Otherwise it's where the smell score is. Feel is decadent. Amazingly complex, smooth, silky w/ a bite at the end. I imagine this beer would age really nicely. I don't really get any of the 10.5% ABV in this either. Maybe a lingering note in the aftertaste if anything. All in all, a world class brew. I will buy this whenever I find it. Cheers."
"Hours of time can be spent with this Wonderful Christmas Beer, contemplating the end of the free world, or enjoying an Episode of Southpark."
"O: If it's Christmas time, you know an unbecoming beer geek, who is just getting into the hobby, and Belgian beers are his/her thing... direct them to this beer."
"O - Excellent Noel and in my opinion one of the best. I highly recommend it."
"I visited my family in Germany early september. took a trip to Belgian beer weekend in Brussels. My son and I were tasting for about 3 hrs. I'm 63, think of myself as one who enjoys good microbrews,never wrote a review before now so, I really can't get ""descriptive"" in my review. I will tell you this.After tasting many the only one that really sticks in my mind is the Gouden carolus noel/ christmas. It had a deep dark and heavy fruit bread flavor. I beleive the Alc. was 10.5 I hope I hope can find it at home in MA."
"A bit sticky, though not thick. Well balanced. Fine, fine compliment to the style though out of place with the majority of the BSDA's you see out there today. Looking forward to my next."
"O: This beer fast-forwarded me to Christmas with its spices and other flavours. A beautiful and smooth beer."
"O: Absolutely delicious; absolutely recommended. I love this beer, and can't wait to drink it again. Quite drinkable, despite the ABV and heaviness."
"Through my extensive beer sampling over the past decade, the tap version of this beer remains the single best beer I have ever had. While the bottled version has slightly less vibrant color and isn't quite as flavorful, the tap version I had several years ago at The Brickskeller in Washington D.C. remains the only beer I have ever gone back and ordered a second time the The Brickskeller. It has a beautiful color, and more importantly, the warm, rich flavor of a Belgian winter ale, topped off with a hint of sweetness. Fresh off the tap, served in a thick goblet, this beer is truly unequalled."
"O-this is just great tasting. i could drink this all night long, which is hard to say for many beers of this weight. i like the Noel spin on the style. it doesn't get old, in fact, i wish i could've had a lot more."
"This is nice, and I say that as someone who holds the bar pretty high for Brouerij Het Anker. A bit more Christmasy than Gouden Carolus Classic, and not as sweet as Kaiser Blauw."
"Overall: Highly recommend. My favorite style is Christmas beers so perhaps I am biased, but this is definitely one of my favorite beers overall. Wam, Bam, thank you Ma'am."
"O: I'm quite pleased with this one. It's sweet, creamy, aromatic, and has a hint of spice that seems to blend well and is rather balanced."
"Opinion: This is a pretty good beer. The sweet balance is a little high for my taste, and that is surprising as I am a malt-head. The high carbonation really does a lot for this beer to make it more drinkable. I don't know what else to say other than that this is a good beer and that I would be proud to have brewed the equivalent...but there are a number of other beers in this category that pass this one up. This is a tough category. This beer is no slouch, but is only ""pretty good"" when held up to the greats in this category."
"Body is very creamy and rich. If black liquorish wasn't so dominant I would really like this beer. Slightly above average though, not bad for the $3 discount bin at my local Hy-Vee Spirit shot...This is one to share with a friend, you're basically drinking 3.5 normal beers given the bottle size and alcohol content."
"D. The high alcohol will sneak up on you in this one, I would say that it's pretty drinkable."
"This beer has what it takes to be a great beer (a big and yet smooth body, a great range of flavours) but it is badly balanced. That's a shame"
"D: this is basically liquor liquorice to me, quirky once but could not even imagine drinking this ever once again but who knows"
"D: I can't drink more than a bottle of it. It has a very high alcohol content, and when drinking it you can taste it. The roasted flavor amplifies the alcohol flavor somehow and just makes it hard to stomach. It's not blended together well. I would not drink this again."
"Holy damn anise-sweetness-coholy! This is an intense brew. Could have use a little more subtelty. But still, it's a straight to the point X-mas brew that will warm you up. Syrupy, heavy, intense."
"D - The alcohol is very well hidden in this brew. While mild, the spice and fruit aspects really make Nöel a nice holiday brew."
"Drinkability: Incredibly complex. Not something to drink on a whim. By the time I got to the end of the bottle I poured the rest of this beer out. It's a shame; I really can't put my finger on what's wrong with this beer."
"D - generally sweet and rich fruitiness, the alcohol is strong but well balanced and works with the flavours, a high octane holiday treat"
"Poured from 750ml bottle into snifter. Clear dark brown with ruby tinges and a thin, tan head. The aroma immediately lets you know what youre in for. Rich winey alcohol hit followed up by powerful orange-tart fruit notes with cinnamon and spice in the background. Flavour is packed with dried fruit, dark muscovado, figs and cherries. Chocolate malts also feature. Superbly balanced sweet-spice finish. The alcohol has an immediate impact with a warming glow spreading outwards. Very rich, full palate with light carbonation it carries the alcohol well."
"D - Overall, I don't care for this as much as the standard Gouden Carolus. There are nice flavors and aromas, but they get muddled by a heavy sweetness and vinegar note that leave an overall cloying impression."
"D - Tastes really good but that odd saltyness throws me off. Light mouthfeel is good but some aspects of this dark ale could be better."
"Mouthfeel is medium with a smooth amount of carbonation. Has a sticky, syrupy finish which works well with the sweetness."
"Had this on tap at Burp Castle in New York City. Pours a dark brown colour with thin off-white head and nice lacing. Smells strongly of black licorice, with cinnamon and brown sugar. I cannot stress how strong the black licorice was, which was too much for me. Trying to keep an open mind since it isn't my favourite flavour, but it was too much. A little bit boozy as well. Big carbonation level. I could only get through about half of this and gave it to a friend. Though he did enjoy it."
"I sip, anise. I gulp, anise. Everything I taste, anise. Bullshit, anise. Unbalanced, overspiced, kinda gross. This will be my last affair with this beer. I'm actually exceptionally puzzled that this was deemed a worthy affair by these brewers whom I consider to have mastered the art of not deluding me into thinking their beer is good. Unfortunately, this will make me think twice of ordering any of their beers in the future."
"Overall - An excellent Christmas beer - perfect for a cold winters night. Highly recommended..."
"A whole lot of modern Christmas jammed into this bottle, yessiree. However, it's less the obvious sweet and spiced usual suspects, and more of the relaxed and mellow, but also an underlying restrained insanity so currently associated with the season - simpler than you imagine, but easily dismissed until it's all over..."
"D: This is a bit boozier than I'd prefer and it wasn't very complex."
"D: I did not enjoy this one as much as I had hoped I would. The hot alcohol in the finish is not very pleasant."
"Pours a clear, dark brown color. 3/4 inch head of an off-white color. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of mint, spice, slight hop, sweet malt, and slight licorice. Fits the style of a Belgian Strong Dark Ale. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of spice, slight sweet malt, cream, licorice, and hint of yeast. Overall, an interesting beer - good appearance, aroma, and blend."
"D - A fantastic way to celebrate Christmas!! Drink this beer it's very very easy!!"
"Price = $4.99 at Whole Foods"
"Draft at The Trappist. Dark amber-brown with fair clarity and a sticky off-white head. Smells strongly medicinal; herbal with black licorice, cough syrup, menthol, caramelized malt and solvent. Palate is similar, huge kick of anise and mint, strong on the herbal/medicinal flavors. Alcohol is less noticeable on the tongue. Finishes with semi-sweet dark candi sugar and an herbal astringency that reminds me of bitters. Not particularly enjoyable."
"D - Its very tasty, but you are done after 1."
" Mild fruity and spicy aroma. Deep reddish brown body, light tan head. Flavor is very rich, moderately sweet. All kinds of ripe fruits, yeasty malt, and a lively highly carbonated mouthfeel. Warming alcohol in both the flavor and the finish. All in all, this is a extremely tasty beer."
"D: Between the sharp sweetness and the alcohol I didn't find it very drinkable."
"D: I really enjoyed this, but I can see how people see it as a jam-like sugar fest as it is very sweet. I am glad the spice components are background but they don't forget the hops and the alcohol contributes a warming, complement to the sweetness."
"Anker matured this specially for two years, I thank them for that."
"interesting brew, a hint too sticky-sweety for my taste but definitely worth a try"
"Overall, a very nice beer. Worth seeking out."
"Warming aftertaste, very malty, with marzipan."
"In general, this beer has potential. I like the smell and the attempt at a very festive fruit-forward beer, but it falls way short. The alcohol is way too high and just ruins the whole experience. Maybe if they had kept the abv to about 9% max, it would be a lot more balanced. I don't regret buying this beer, but I'll definitely think twice before purchasing it again."
"D: Not really a brew for me, high on alcohol taste."
"D- Great brew. A bit sweet, but the quality of this brew is incredible and it is a true experience for the palette."
"This style can be particularly difficult to drink, at least relative to the manner in which most drink other beers. But truthfully, when I drink a belgian dark, the warm alcohol taste and feel is of course expected, but I'd like to get cozy with a little more than that. This beer kind of fails in that area, as I wouldn't seek this beer out again, though I still think its a good beer/winter selection."
"At the Mohawk House in Sparta, NJ. Into a tulip, it poured an opaque brown, with one finger of tan head that both retained and laced well, with no visible carbonation. Smelled of big spiciness, sour plums, candied pears, and a hint of alcohol presence. The taste confirmed the candied pear presence first and foremost, along with sour plum and black cherry, and then finished on a sweet note, with the alcohol well-hidden throughout, or at least much moreso than in the nose. Smooth and of medium thickness; very little carbonation. Tastes like a nice warming beer, though the abundance of sour plum and pear almost made it too fruitcakey for me."
"Drinkability: A warming winter offering from Gouden Carolus. The black licorice is a love it or hate it thing, and is the main flavor in the beer. Would go nice with some gingerbread cookies."
"D - Overall, this was one tasty ale. That being said, I'm not certain I could take down more than one bomber of this stuff. The ABV is relatively well hidden, but at 10.5% it's tough to be inconspicuous. The flavour bouquet is quite unique and intense, and a worthy offering for any fan of dark Belgians."
"A rich full holiday ale with spices blended to perfection. Dark and lovely in the glass with a thick head and plenty of lace. Notes of rum, port, spiced cakes and dark fruits. Taste is all that and more with a gentle alcohol warming. Caramel center sits atop dark sweet breads. Mild hops let the sweetness linger in the finish as the heat subtly glides in. Dry and mostly clean with a bit of sweet port. Feel is almost quad like in its richness but not quite. Smooth full carbonation with a nice weight to the fluid. Goes down quite well and the abv never really shows itself until you feel it. A new fave for the holiday season."
"Body is medium and carbonation is light. I am not able to distinguish individual spices but I believe they're there, working at the complexities in my glass, begging me to try this again in a different mood, a different context, so I might find them. Others may have dinged this beer for its unique phenolic flavors, but I find them to be just as weird as anything else! This beer gets high marks from me for its dry finish and complex port-like aromatics, mixed with a sweet middle of caramel malt."
"Aging is strongly recommended. After 1 year the body and smoothness that didn't met my expectations last year (that doesn't mean I didn't enjoyed this beer ;) ) are now very satisfactory"
"Drinkability is very desirable, but truly a Christmas beer. I can't see myself having this in July when it's 90 degrees out of course ;) but... why would you want to ;)"
"D: Average. Interesting"
"Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"D: Very enjoyable beer, very drinkable. Not what I would expect from a Christmas style beer though. So judging this stylistically it is a great beer, but when they slapped the word ""Noel"" on it I would hope for something that reminds me of the season."
"A very nice Christmas beer, rewarding to just sip and enjoy."
"Notes: Sure the booze has a bit of a prominent edge, but it is not out of sync with brews offering a similar profile or some of the other Gouden Carolus I've tried, for instance it may lack some of the nuances and complexities of the reserve but this is worth picking up and repeating in any case."
"Overall, a very good beer, if not particularly unique."
"A very nice Belgian Christmas-time ale. The flavors here are a bit different from some others, but it works quite well. The alcohol gives it a nice ""winter warmer"" effect too, without actually tasting the alcohol."
"Big points on drinkability - this would be a lot of fun on draft, and if you ever need to choke down grandma's fruitcake, just pour one of these to pair with it - it would make it taste good."
"Sugary licorice really overpowers this beer, rendering it cloying and almost Jägermeister-like. Hard to have too much."
"Notes: The brew has a lot of interesting characteristics and an expansive flavor profile. And I love Het Anker. But ultimately there's just too much going on and the multitude of tastes almost confuse your palate. Although I like beers with unique and complicated profiles, I like the flavors to blend into a sort of singularity. This brew's flavors, although interesting and distinct, are conflicting and awkward."
"Very good Christmas ale. This would make an excellent accompaniment to Thanksgiving dinner."
"drinkability is good - very easy driniking for a 10.5% brew"
"Flavor early on was mostly dark fruit and bananas. As it warmed the banana flavor faded slightly and a ton of koolaid like cherry introduced itself. I was patient with this beer as I thought it would be more quad like and less fruit. Overall i was satisfied but wouldnt buy it again."
"This was supposed to be my after work Friday treat. I'm tipping it and switching to my Bunnahabhain single cask. So there."
"jd"
"Pours a nice dark brown with some garnet hues. Nice of white head. The nose brings forward some dark fruits, booze, and quite a bit of wintry spice. Lots of black licorice. The taste is caramel, bread, dark fruit, dates, alcohol, and some nice nutmeg, clove, and a bit of other spices. Loads of anise. Overpoweringly so. Medium mouthfeel; a bit creamy. Drinks quite well and is a nice addition our holiday lineup."
"Drinkability: Meh -- not something that I'll be seeking out as it's too sweet and medicinal; the ABV would also prove to be a bit much as well; ultimately, if the sweetness is something you like, this may be your beer, but as for me, I like a bit more balance with the spices, and if it's going to be sweet, I like it to be more from the caramel maltiness as I feel it blends better and allows other aspects to come through."
"Wow, this is tasty! It starts off with the figs and dates with a finish that is sweet like cotton candy. This is a great noel."
"Drinkability: I've a hard choice here, as it is hard for me to rate something with 10+% ABV as very drinkable. But I love the flavor, so here goes: I would go out of my way to have this beer again."
"D: would be better in winter or at least on a cool day....but even on a warm day the alcohol taste was not over the top and blended well with the figgy, date, raisen essence."
"M&D: full-bodied and delicious. Easy to drink if you're into spicy winter brews. Recommended!"
"Wow, I gotta say that nearly 2 years did wonders for this beer. Very balanced and delcious. Another winner from GC. Cheers!"
" D- This beer has a dry but fruity quality to the flavor and it rich but well blended in its complexity with flavors working well together. The alcohol is very well hidden."
"Pours a dark reddish brown with a thin, dark tan head. Almost no lacing. Aromas of dark stewed fruit, anise, chocolate covered cherries, pumpernickel and the obligatory nutmeg and cinnamon. Strong flavors of brown sugar, overripe banana, caramel, and anise. A flavor reminiscent of ""circus peanut"" candy in the back palate. The body is milky and rich. It seems to melt into the palate, creating a lingering finish. Very pleasant fresh, but I prefer bottles with a few years on them."
"Really lingering taste still hours later. Unpleasant."
"D - This brew is very nice, not tremendously challenging, but very easily appreciated and enjoyed."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability: Very drinkable for such a big beer. Smooth and full with a good carbonation."
"D: Delicious on it's own, or would go well as a dessert beer. One of my favorites Belgium Christmas beers, what a pleasant surprise to see it available in the Spring."
"d - I thought this was an above average Belgian. I enjoyed the sweet smell and taste of dark fruits and sweet malts, and would definitely try this again."
"Notes: The final in my short series of Het Anker beers, likely my favorite."
"Overall this is a very nice Belgian Strong Dark Ale with a winter seasonal flair. With about three years of age under its belt, this beer as matured nicely and seems superior to it fresh. Recommended."
"D: Definitely wouldn't recommend more than a sampling of this...too sweet."
"Recommended music pairing: Ray Charles - That Spirit of Christmas"
"Overall: I don't know if they have changed the recipe since the Bros reviewed it, but, it was a great beer for me. There is a lot going on, and it could be restrained a bit better, however, the flavors do work together, particularly in the finish. There is a bit of sweet and alcohol that is not blended completely out by the hit of spice at the end. Overall though, one of the better noels I've had this year."
"D: This is one tasty brew, along with one heck of a heavy hitter. A couple of these and you'll be wearing the old wobbly boot."
"D: Low drinkability. Too strong taste for me. Might be a good beer but overloaded me..."
"O: great sipping beer, very rich and sweet, nice spiciness, complex, very quad-like"
"Overall, not a great the feel is to light, the taste is light and too much spice."
"D - I like this beer quite a bit I will definitely buy one again next year."
"Very pleasant, another winner from Het Anker. Not your typical Christmas fare but I would gladly grab for this one again next Yule season."
"Mouthfeel is a little thin for me, but the carbonation is pretty crisp. I think is would go with more body and less carbonation, but that's me. For a 10.5 it goes down really fast. There is a mild alcohol burn, but the spices keep it shadowed."
"D: Tasty, goes down dangerously easy, not too filling, deceptively strong kick, good representation of style, this is a nice stronger Belgian-style beer to drink for a while until it starts to catch up with you."
"Taste is malty and sweet. The beer is syrupy without being overly sticky. The spices are a little less present than the smell would make me suspect. Some Christmas beers have a thin mouthfeel, but this beer is full-bodied. The mix of the malt and the spices combined with the strong caramel malt base make this a great Christmas beers."
"Some interesting flavors but too hot and estery to be very drinkable."
"Had a bottle aged a few years and dang was it good. it was lightly headed an light colored tasted initially sweet with a tangy sour finish. Smell was also sweet. The predominate flavors were almonds. It had a smooth flavor. I could have sipped on this all evening."
"Of all of Belgium's great breweries I'd have to say that Het Anker has to be one of the greatest. And while I recognize this as just my opinion, I'd leave it up to anyone to try this Noël beer (or their Tripel or their Classic or their Cuvee de Keiser, etc) and try and argue me. I just assume the town of Mechelen has a traditional Christmas carol that makes some mention of this beer - because if it doesn't already, it definitely should."
"D: Way too drinkable for it's size, great flavour, this beer could be dangerous at a Christmas party."
"Very nice. Excellent Belgian style Christmas beer!"
"Decent chestnut hue with a sizeable tan head-typical big Belgian carbonation level. Nicely sweet and deep aroma-a lot of dried fruits and caramel sugars. Very malty and sweet flavor. Mildly spicy but more from the yeast then any spices per se. Sugary. Lingering bite though not bitter. Heavy mouthfeel. I quite like this though I could se how someone might find it over the top in sweetness and the like. Taken for what I think it is I like it in moderation. Nice full dessert like beer."
"Drinkability: Its a nice beer, a Christmas treat, but not something you'd really want to buy over one of several better Belgian darks. The sweetness would be fine, but there's not quite enough huge maltiness to balance it. The bitter orange and pepper also becomes overbearing."
"Still a very interesting beer! Love how they have gotten such an intense liqourice-attack without it just mashing the rest of the brew to shit, try it if you can, special!"
"D: Incredibly easy, although the anise taste is a little much towards the end. One and done for me, but glad I could try this"
"Drinkability: The tussin quality kills this one for me."
"salud!"
"This poured a hazy ruby mahogany with lots of light tan head. It smelled like licorice and dark toffee and dry roasted barley, with some creamy yeast. It tasted like banana nut bread and cocoa powder, with some pear and licorice and creamy yeast. After warming some, it tasted much like root beer. It was oily with some smooth carbonation, and had a mild aftertaste with slight alcohol warming. Overall this had a good clean taste with great body, although I wasn't a huge fan of the flavor. I really prefer the rich maltiness of Van De Keizer, and would love to try that with a bit of added spices."
"This one pours a dark, semi-translucent brown, definitely a good start. Aroma is strong, sharp and more like a good rum than a beer. Biting flavor is fruity, syrupy, sweet but not cloying. Texture is smooth and yet rough and strongly fizzy, biting the tongue and leaving a finish like an angry tomcat scratching on its way down."
"Overall: A rich, dense, chewy slightly carbonated, and creamy. The body of the beer is thick and the finish is medium full. This beer has a lot flavor and complexity. I was rather surprised by how good this beer was. I am enjoying it very much."
"An absolutely spectacular nightcap, which won many people including non beer geeks. Definitely need to get more for next year. An absolute must for a Christmas party finish."
"Overall, this is a nice brew. It's relatively complex and pleasantly flavorful. Warming alcohol makes finishing this 750 ml bottle a bit of a challenge, but I'm willing to take one for the team."
"not the most enjoyable christmas beer ive had, way too much licorice not enough malt...have had this out of a bottle and dont remember it being like this..."
"Summary: One of my top three winter warmers. I will undoubtedly be drinking this one again."
"The sheer viscosity and complexity of the beer can be a bit overwhelming at first, but as the carbonation winds down and the beer warms up, the beer reveals a sour, unbalanced construction that I did not expect from Brouwerij Het Anker. It doesn't break the beer, but it does make it a bit difficult to drink."
"Dark reddish brown color with a thick white long lasting head. Chocolate and roasted coffee aroma. Very strong alcohol taste throughout. Some notes of semi-sweet chocolate and malt with used coffee grounds. Slightly bitter finish. Average all the way."
"Pretty drinkable beer overall; a little boozy-tasting though."
"D - A definate choice for those christmas times. I drank it in the summer and still enjoyed it though."
"(The third time I've had to edit this review before i finished the bottle) as it warms the flavors really come through and add to its complexity. Please don't drink this cold!!"
"Medium drnkability."
"Drinkability : a good beer in the style Belgian strong dark ale (to drink at cellar t°)."
"Overall a tasty and complex strong ale."
"This Noel is a fine Yuletide quaff that makes me realize why I like the holidays. Bon Noel!"
"Mouthfeel/drinkability: Full body and medium carbonation make it easy to drink. The after taste is not as good as should be expected."
"Drinkability:it`s very complex and open to alot of interpretation ,is it christmasy ? i don`t know, maybe with a fruit cake but that has alot to say ."
"An enjoyable beer. I can tastes every bit of the 10.5% ABV. Similar to Cuvee Van De Keizer. Fans of that beer (like me) will enjoy this, but this seems to lack some of the complexities that Van De Keizer has."
"Much smoother than Cuvee VDK, which is also very good. But this is creamy and leaves only a slight tingle on the tongue. Despite the high a.b.v., I'd still love to drink these all night. Just wish it was easier to find."
"A good beer but not a great Belgian."
"5 M&4.5 D: incre...dibly smooth and light on the mouthfeel, where the ultra-subtle carbonation is balanced well with the velvety-smooth texture and a slightly tangy kickback as a healthy balancer. Overall, not terribly complex, but this bottled-version outperforms the tap version by a mile, for its delicate body and balance, easily tricking one (me, at least) to believe it's a 7-8%abv.(at most) dark ale. Extre...mely dan...gerously drinkable it is, yet utterly enjoyable be it X'mas, Easter, Chinese New Year, summer solstice, or whichever else occasion.... Cheers!!"
"Bottle at the Abbot on the Hill. Pours a lucid mahogany with a generous tan head that slowly fades, and laces well. Very spicy, sweet aroma, with hints of caramel and cinamon. I'm getting lots of caramel in the flavour, which is very malt-forward. Lots of dark fruit too, with cheeries, raisins, aniseed, chocolate and spice. There's a lot going on here, and I don't think I'm quite nailing it. The carbonation contributes to a smooth body that goes down well. An excellent winter beer that disappeared all too soon."
"Body is medium and very drinkable."
"nice, but overall just a little TOO much going on with the sweet/spice spectrum."
"Overall I just didn't really care for this one too much, it's a shame I was really looking forward this one as I usually really enjoy winter Belgians."
"D- At 10.5% this one's a sipper for sure and i'm glad i shared the bottle as I probably would not have finished this alone. Not the best BSDA but worth a shot. The balance of the flavors could improve."
"This dark reddish-amber brew has a fantastic aroma. The smell is, at first, dominated by lightly roasted malts, but soon a load of esters pop forward. Banana, clove, and peach are prominent. By the time the beer warms a little, though, the aroma is full-on licorice. The licorice flavor is intense and penetrating. Wonderful range of smells! The flavor is also interesting, although it tends to be a little too sugary for my tastes. Malt is the foremost taste. Lots of residual sugars (you can taste them on the lips). There's a little yeast, and a little alcohol. Nice warming...nearly tongue numbing by the end of the bottle. The beer is medium in body, and lower in carbonation than it could have been. Firm, long lasting, soapy head too. Not bad at all.."
"Not my favorite. This brew is all malt. I prefer some more hops to balance the tastse. Abv is 10.5% so drink carefully"
"I'm not too far removed from my paperbagging 40oz days. Some think too much alcohol and sweetness ruins a beer - too bad for them. Not amazing, but on a lonely Christmas Eve, I'll curl up next to a warm sidewalk grate with one of these bottles."
"D- I had a hard time finishing the first glass. The flavor is too tart, too sweet, too much. I feel it was overdone and it was hard to get through the bottle."
"D - This is the apex of Belgian brewing. One of the finest brews that I've ever had the pleasure of enjoying."
"I reviewed this by bottle but have had this recently on tap. I feel it is much better on tap. Much more complex with the flavors really expressing themselves."
"Mouthfeel is decent, as it has somewhat of a soda-like feel to it. Very odd. It's full bodied with a slightly syrupy mouthfeel. This is not a poor brew by any means, as it definitely has one of the more unique and pleasing aromas I've encountered recently. It's just not my thing, way too sweet. The mouthfeel is kind of ""off"" as well."
"Not a bad beer, good for winter months and holidays. Very sweet, making it hard to drink a lot. Not bad though."
"D-I like the complexity of this brew. It's quite different, which helps with its drinkability, but besides being different, it's also very enjoyable. I was saddened when I completed my bottle. I look forward to finding this one again, even if it's until next Christmas."
"This was a sweet ale that was very easy on the palate but not too sweet like some winter seasonals. Weighing in at over 10% this beer has a well balanced list of highly prized characteristics that make this beer surprisingly enjoyable. I bought this beer at Whole Foods in Westwood."
"I really enjoyed drinking this beer. Didn't have a strong alcohol flavor. Had a beautiful malty fruity flavor. The Map Room in Chicago described a banana flavor and although I'm not one to compare beer to fruit very often, I would say their description was pretty good. The taste is very complex where every sip evolved into a different flavor."
"Im gonna go out on a limb and say this one is kinda rare... but even it isnt drink this one up and enjoy"
"This is one of the better Belgian holiday ales I've had, mainly because I actually enjoyed having that slightly peppery finish which differentiated it from a normal BSDA. Tasty."
" Body is medium to almost full tho something seems missing- this has all the components yet fails to impress. I think this may mellow in the bottle in 2 - 6 months into something a little more rounded and complex - complexity and meshing of flavors may develop with a few months age. Very easy and tasty to drink - went real well with roasted and salted pecans and brie on crusty bread."
"Rum butter, toffee, candied fruit, roasted malt, a little chocolate, and bubble gum sneaking through; but intensifying in the finish with chocolate covered raisin and blue fruit. Gentle hop bitterness in the back. Fantastic mouthfeel and very good drinkability."
"D - Even with the high ABV this is more than drinkable and will be a total pleasure to enjoy during the coming holidays. Cheers! :)"
"Quite spectacular. Perhaps a bit too sweet, but a really nice bottle to pick up for the holidays."
"A big beer as far as Christmas ales go. Slow down and enjoy this one."
"D: I could not think of a better beer to go with various occasions. A wallop of sweetness packed with power and a smooth delivery make this an exceptional beer."
"Drinkability - I enjoyed it. It is a slow sipper, a good choice while watching Christmas shows or wrapping gifts. Probably worth aging one to see what time would do the the hotness. A fine choice to celebrate one more week until Christmas Day. :-)"
"Drinkability: Excellent. I had it by itself, but would be perfect for an after-christmas dinner treat."
"Notes: A little out of balance right now, it might fall together better with some age. The spices are really loud and I can't hear the beer itself. A decent effort, but I'll stick with the Cuvee and the Classic."
"I have half a mind to stay right here and finish the keg. Sounds like a plan..."
"somewhat violent pop. pour was at first 80% latte head with tight bubbles. let it sit for a few minutes. head is still belgian massive. tastes quite nice and creamy. nice contraction. big lace. beer is a dark chestnut, almost cola. nose is light belgian cane and malt... st. bernadus proir 8 style. cotton candy and cardamon and sweet orange peel. quite a nice density. cane sugar is there but not masking everything else. honey malt, banana, orange peel, cardamon, walnut, pollen and very gentle cane sugar floral led hop finish, clove maybe. lots of stuff in here but it seems the beer takes a bit to open up due to that aggressive carbonation. don't burn on the palate though so its not that harsh. burps up banana/pumpkin bread. the alcohol is faint on the nose but hidden quite well in the beer. i like the foam but i can see it being a turn off for some."
"This beer pours a redish brown color with a nice two finger tan head. I gotta say this one looks great in my Duvel tulip. Smells of sweet fruits - cherries, figs and raisins and a cherry, a liquor smell that i can't quite place and alcohol at the end. Tastes of tart/sweet fruits - raisins, dark malt and alcohol at the end. The mouthfeel is light yet very smooth. Drinkability is decent but I don't think I would have another because of the high alcohol content and high price tag."
"On tap at The Red in Santa Cruz. Dark cloudy brown color with a creamy tan head that leaves nice lacing. Aroma is boozy with lots of orange peel, cinnamon, and fig. A little too boozy for me though. Flavor is similar; there's a sweet dark maltiness doused in fusels with tropical and dark fruits and heavy spicing. Full bodied and warming, not hugely drinkable from all the alcohol."
"D- Because of the heat, this isn't extremely drinkable, but wasn't un-drinkable. I'd say, worth a shot."
"Overall this is one of the more interesting Christmas beers that I've tried. Give this one a shot if for no other reason than for how unique it tastes."
"Dark in color with a nice off-white head. Smells and tastes of dark malts with a heavy anise overtone; very smooth and rich, with a medium body. Drinkability suffers a little from the heavy taste of anise and the high abv, but it's still an awesome beer that's definitely worth trying."
"Drinkability: Grr, when I get my hands on whoever dropped a shot of Jägermeister in my Gouden Carolus Noël, I'll take my shoe to them!"
"Pretty weak offering from an otherwise strong brewery."
"Pours a dark chestnut brown with a large forhty head. Very malty, spicy aroma with hints of dark fruit, chocolate and pepper. Sweet matly alcohol taste up front with a dry, peppery finish with hints of raisin and dark cherries."
"A bit too sweet, boozy and almost too syrupy for me to really enjoy this one too much. It has a nice enough sweet candy, with a bit of a fruity character for slow sipping, but too sweet for the whole thing - Glad to have shared it."
"D. I probably expected too much? but is is not a bee I will recommand, tomorrow I will have a hopsinjoor in order to go on with a positive image of Het Anker"
"Serving type: bottle"
"Dark mahogany with a thick tan head. Excellent lacing. The nose has spices, Belgian yeasts, dark malts, ripe fruits and candy. The taste is again a delicious blend of sweet fruity malts and Christmas spices. Full body holds a delicate carbonation. Another great brew from Het Anker."
"D: wonderful beer. needs a little time to mellow out IMO. very nice flavors and a great seasonal belgian strong."
"Overall, kind of a mess. Too much alcohol in the taste and feel makes for an unpleasant experience. A lower alcohol content could have made for a much better beer."
"D - Tasty but a little too sweet for me."
"The taste is equally as sweet and very fruity with some notable clove spice. Again, lots of banana, plum, cotton candy, yeast and a very subtle note of alcohol. Overall just a little too sweet with a lack balance to the finish. Light-medium body with acceptable carbonation for this style, the mouthfeel is a bit watery and the sweetness becomes a bit much, before long. Although quite drinkable with the alcohol hidden fairly well, my expectations for this brew were a bit stifled. Probably opt for a tastier holiday selection next time."
"Drinkability- Good, but not great. The taste had e a bizarre cafeteria feel to it."
"D: A must try but one may be enough."
"The appearance did not do justice for the beer. Understand that beer is 10% + so the light appearance of the beer, lack of lacing was a bit surprising."
"An excellent X-mas beer. The best I've had this year so far. Good stuff."
"Lovely x-mas beer!"
"Pours a clear dark red/almost purple color with some sediment. 2+ fingers of foamy beige-tan head made up of tiny bubbles has good retention and leaves nice lacing. Smells of caramel, sugar plums, bananas, molasses, butter, Christmas spices, bread, and alcohol. The taste follows the aroma; caramel, banana, molasses, bread, cinnamon, nutmeg, clove, and dark fruits with a touch of licorice and enough of an alcohol warmth in the finish. Medium to medium full in body with good carbonation, syrupy but smooth with a nice sweetness from both malt and fruit but a little medicinal as it warms. A nice holiday ale, but the high alcohol notes leaves it at a once a year type brew."
"Creamy-looking small-bubbled lace retains well, and the dark brown color displays a glowing clarity. Heavy aroma of dark malts, black pepper, bitter orange peel, earth, faint vanilla, black currants, lavender, a hint of fusel alcohol and other vague spice tones. Smooth and creamy mouth feel off of a full body. Beefy, with a juicy caramel malt splash up front. An alcoholic bite thrashes the taste buds. Spicy, with suggestions of white pepper. The fruity, alcoholic esters drop a tropical bomb. Kiwi, pineapple and papaya come to mind. This has hot fermentation written all over it. Unfortunately, the ﬁ nish and aftertaste is dominated by this hard, lingering alcohol character, and it does not get better as the beer warms up. A mess."
"Superb drinkability with the 10% alcohol well hidden behind the plethora of flavors. A real classy holiday treat, even on a warm May night in Florida."
"D: Quite drinkable for its strength."
"Taste is way too sweet, syrupy and sugary for its own good, nice buttery slickness though, heavy malt presence that dominates any subtle spices, some dark fruit lingers around but is also pushed to the back."
"The pour was a nice one, a nice dark brown with a thick fluffy three finger head with great retention. The head laces the glass for a good while. Right off the bat I could catch caramel and chocolate in my first sniff. There may even be hints of nuts and fruit, but I definitely caught the alcohol fragrance. It tasted almost like chocolate cake with caramel and roasted malts at first, but after a few sips I caught the strong alcoholic after notes. The mouthfeel is chewy and thick and drinkability is good, but this is definitely a beer to sip and enjoy."
"Dear Nebraska BAs, I will do my best to get this beer into Nebraska next winter. No promises of course but God do I want it! This beer freaking rocks... it is so rich, so complex and yet so light and easy to drink. The alcohol is hidden aside from the belly warming and brain fuzziness. I bought my 750ml bottle in Lawrence, KS and if I knew it was anywhere this good I would have bought more. I can't overstate how lovely a quaff this is. Wow. Highly recommended!"
"Tremendous BSDA, one of my favorites."
"Poured into a tulip a nice brown color, nice carbonation, nice one-finger creamy off-white head, some nice sticky lacing follows. The nose is malty with some yeast, figs, raisins, plums, and some nice tones of caramel. The taste is slightly sweet, malty, very nice tones of dark fruit and caramel. Medium body, a nice balance/complex brew. Very drinkable, another awesome brew from these guy's, highly recommended."
"This is my very first review so please bear with me! I will get better at this!! Had this beer on draft just before Christmas at my local pub. Served in a snifter. Smell extremely aromatic. Taste Heavenly. Definately a holiday beer with many complex spices and fruit flavors. Heavy, full bodied, nothing missing in this beer. One glass per sitting for me. Loved this beer so much I searched high and low to buy some for my Christmas Eve party. Needless to say, everyone wanted more and it can't be found!!! Next year I will buy a case and HIDE IT!"
"Overall, an interesting beer that's flavor is quite different than most others in the style. I like it, but i think there are others i would go after when in the mood."
"This is a damn near perfect beer. In my opinion, it is everything Maudite wishes it was.. a kick ass strong red belgian. I am drinking this bottle way too fast, but I honestly don't care. It's THAT good. Can't wait to try out the other offerings from this brewer that are lurking in my beer fridge..."
"Had this on tap at the Brick Store Pub in a Gouden Carolus glass. Poured a very dark brown, almost black with a decent head that fades somewhat quickly but that leaves some excellent lacing. Lots of licorice and anis aromas coming from the glass, and the same is true of the flavors. Licorice up front, followed by a delicious sweet breadiness, followed by a hit of anis on the finish. The mouthfeel is big and creamy, and though it's got a high abv, its not hot at all. Overall it is a wonderful winter warmer with a slightly different flavor profile from the rest."
"All in all, a nice BSDA, but not a world beater."
"IDefinitely a winter warmer at 10.5% abv, just not my favorite."
"Had this at the Dive Bar in Worcester, MA. It was cellared for 2 years. By far the most complex beer I've ever had. Very hard to pinpoint all of the flavors. Definitely some licorice but not overpowering. A whole variety of fruits and spices including cinnamon, raisin, plum, cherry, etc. All these flavors blended well. This definitely is the type of beer that you'll want to sip on to really appreciate the complexity. I recommend this brew, but only if you cellar it. I'm not usually big on the overly spiced Christmas beers, but this is one of the best I've had to date."
"Drinkability is ok just a little to much liquorice for my tastes but if thats not a problem for you probably, you will enjoy this one a bunch."
"Pours dark ruby-brown with a small head. The aroma is sweet malt and fruity. The taste is slightly sweet malt, with dark fruits and complex spices and molasses. Nice mouth feel and warming when swallowed. We enjoyed this as our Christmas Eve beer. The high ABC went down very smoothly."
"Smooth and a bit syrupy with a velvety texture on the tongue. Plenty of warmth and moderate carbonation. A nice fruity/sweet/Belgian holiday treat. Not something I would necessarily drink during the warmer months though."
"Some one read the recipe that said 1 teaspoon and accidentally put in 1 tablespoon. Tooo much spice. It's like drinking nyquil beer, or beer mixed with black licorice. I like the idea of the spice beer, but this is just too over the top."
" The 750 ml bottle poured amber -ish brown the head for how long that it lasted in my Chimay challis was brownish but it turned to a nice lace. The mouth feel on this is incredibly smooth and it has a nice carbonation on the tongue. Aromas of sweet candy sugar along with Christmas spices (cinnamon, anise, cloves) with some dark fruit thrown in .Flavors of sweet malt , licorice along with a nice clean bitter finish to me it taste more like a spice than a hop bitter . It has a warming alcohol effect as well so this is a great winter sipper I will be looking for another one of these to put away for next year"
"Pours a brown-ish amber color with a light tan head. In the aroma, cinnamon and licorice. In the taste, licorice and hints of alcohol and cinnamon. A spicy and alcohol bite in the mouthfeel and a dry cinnamon and sweet alcohol in the aftertaste. Shows a small amount of alcohol but mostly hidden, nice flavors and very tasty."
"Drinkability: Kinda of boozy and lots of phenols, but this is a winner. Spicy with Belgian yeast but nutty. I didn't know this brewery made a Christmas ale! Perfect for an Eve like this one! Cheers!"
"M/D: Full. slightly creamy bodied, a bit high on the carbonation, drinkability is good, but not great, as this is quite the hardy ale and at 10.50% you aren't going to throw very many of these babies back. Overall, this one is a seasonal treat."
"Not much in the way of drinkability."
"Drinkability is rather high, as the taste is good and the finish is pretty clean and quick. If you like it, then you'll probably really like it."
"Quite nice. Ignore my scoring and get some as soon as you can."
"This beer is everything I want in a Belgian Christmas beer. I will buy more before the season is up."
"Lots of deep notes of sweetness and spices and a warming alcohol effect make this a perfect Belgian beer for sipping by the fire during those cold winter nights."
"Overall, a good choice and a very distinctive first tasting for the season. I will probably snag another bottle of this before the end of the holidays because it's a good example of the broad 'style' of spicy holiday Ales."
"Heady and warming, yet very drinkable. Great enjoyable beer."
"pours dark brown with little head, but more than classic. nose is spicy and sweet. at first one tastes the sweet ambree taste of most het anker brews, but quickly licorice and alcohol tones, maybe some coriander emerge. not as smooth as i expected from one of belgiums finest brouwerijs, but very unique in style and a great winter warming effect."
"I poured this gross beer into my tumbler at 50 degrees. It was a nice mahoganny color with a pretty tan head that was teaming with tiny fine bubbles and looking great. Then I smelled, whew, sour apples or vineger. Then I tasted and again sour yuk to me. Some like the sour brews but since tis is my review I say YUK ! I will not buy again/"
"Pours black, almost opaque, until raised to the light, when beautiful garnet highlights shine through. Head is huge, leaving a tan lace on the glass with each sip. Aroma is dark malt, candi suger and loads of dark fruit, including figs, dates and even some figgy pudding. Alcohol notes shine through in aroma. Flavor reveals more candi sugar, alcohol and dark fruits. Warming all the way down, leaving rich dark chocolate aftertaste. Body is suitably light for a Belgian style beer."
"Pours dark brown with a very high and creamy head that is sustained for quite some time. The smell is of licorice and raisons, with dark malts and spices. Flavor-wise, the front is sweet and full of dark fruit, while the finish is bready and slightly hoppy. There is also a smokey character to the middle and finish. It's very smooth, but a bit thin for my taste. I love spicey Christmas ales; this may be one of my favorite versions!"
"Pours out the color of water after having soaked raisins in it with a thinnish, off-white, frothy head. Leaves some scattered lace. Smell is of anise, all-spice, cinnamon, ginger, and citrus peel along with some spiciness from the yeast, some dark, brown-sugary malts, and a touch of alcohol. The licorice/cinnamon thing reminds me of biscochitos which would be very apropros for a holiday beer. Taste is overwhelmed by anise and fennel seed flavors with the other spices regulated to the background. Malt sweetness is prevalent though. Mouthfeel is not too thick or heavy considering the sweetness and the carbonation is lively. The anise is a bit much for me and hinders drinkability."
"D- Smooth and fruity beer full of winter spices, alcohol presence is stiff and limits drinkability"
"Don't know what to say about this brewing company, I remember loving their amber and triple... but this was something pretty special. I will probably pick up a 4-pack for the cellar even though I don't believed they're bottle conditioned."
"Even though this one tastes like it was ""dry-hopped"" with kielbasa, it still seems to be a pretty good brew. I'm sure other people will interpret the flavors as something else. Recommended."
"Finish is very long, with cocoa powder, and alcohol. Warms you up quite well."
"D: I drank a few of these and they went down with ease. For the style, very easy to drink."
"Pours redish brown,with a thin tan head. Not much retention,and just a bit of lacing. Aroma is of cherry cola,licorice,spice,and dark fruits. Body is medium to heavy with a bit of carbonation. Taste is of dark sweet cherries,spice,and black licorice.Excellent!"
"poured a ruby reddish brown with a big, light tan colored head. great head retention and beautiful lace. from the nose, i got fruit (just a little banana and some dark), spice (clove, cinnamon, ginger, pepper, licorice), roasted malt and some dark sugar. taste exhibited all the same and was definitely full of different tastes every sip. full, soft, creamy, velvety and well carbonated. only the belgians seem to be able to make their beers so full bodied and so weightless feeling at the same time. a little bit of a booze finish and some spice that might not appeal to everyone, but i can imagine this being near perfect as an after Christmas dinner beer."
"This beer pours a sheer brown color. The head is massive, billowy, and off white. The aroma is immense. It was noticeable even during the pour. Soft spices, lavender, and flowers. The taste is very floral, with a hint of cream. The mouthfeel is full bodied with a velvety texture. Overall, this is a very good beer."
"Drinkability: Well here we have Christmas in July; the beer has settled down somewhat, based on some complaints about fusel alcohol; it should be cellared for six months to a year to let everything mellow out"
"D- Sipper but nice and fun to share."
"Overall: A decent Belgian beer that's a little rough around the edges. I'm hoping the alcohol fumes calm down when i age a few bottles."
"Mouthfeel is medium/full bodied, sugary sweet up front with a smooth, warming cake-like dessert enjoyability."
"D: Great great great. I love this beer. Could drink all night, but would end up on the floor if I did!"
"This one goes on to my ""Buy List"" next time I'm in Belgium. A very good beer."
"<grin>"
"thanks for bringing in IPFreely."
"Bottle: Poured a deep burgundy brown color ale with a huge foamy head with great retention and good lacing. Aroma of sweet candy and anis is dominating and quite enjoyable and almost reminiscent of Rochefort. Taste is a nice mix between strong Belgian malt, sweet candy and anis. There is some sweetness but it never goes overboard and provides great balance with some light typical Belgian yeast. It appears that this brewery just wont stop to amaze me with all those great beers."
"This brew has a very full body. It is also very warm to the palate."
"Really, this beer is simply delicious. I wish I had some almond biscotti, as I think this would be the perfect accompaniment. Definitely my favorite Belgian Noel, and also my favorite Carolus. Seek it out!"
"A 750ml bottle. Medium brown color, thin head, well-carbonated. It had a fruity and spicy aroma. A dark fruit taste, with warming spices. Pleasant enough, but I wouldn't want a lot in one sitting. I'm not sure the fruit and spice combination works that well for me, but at the same time it does seem a little different from the typical Christmas beers."
"Pours a two-fingered creamy white head that fades slowly to a thin layer leaving some lace. Cloudy mahogany color. Strong carbonation and medium-heavy bodied. Raisin/plum nose. Flavor - sweet raisin, caramel and spices, high ABV is noticeable. Nice Christmas ale. 750ml bottle, gift from Liquid Solutions Oregon City Or."
"This stuff is deceptively drinkable, an absolute pleasure to imbibe. Mommy I want more! Best to stock some of this away to share with special people on special occassions, it's just not for Xmas anymore. Wow. I haven't felt this happy drinking a beer since my last bottle of Unibroue 10."
"D: This is a one-and-done beer for me because of the abv, but is certainly something I'd get again. Is a nice change of pace from Christmas beers that load up on the nutmeg and cinnamon. I'm going to buy up a few bottles and stick 'em in the cellar for next Christmas."
"This one is certainly a classic. Possibly even better than the Kaiser."
"Once again I must admit that this is a grand beer indeed. A little less carbonation and alcohol and it would have been perfect."
"I passed this up on Christmas for something else I cannot recall. I would not have forgotten this. It's not really spectacular, but rather it's a zesty Belgian Yule celebration. The ABV is as it should be, big and glowing, but it warms and wraps and works as a nice cozy bonus. Next year this beer will be sure to garner holiday billing."
"Dangerously drinkable, slightly thinner than I expected, but still very smooth. Het Anker is still yet to disappoint. I plan on aging a couple of bombers of this one."
"I love this Belgian ale. It pours dark coppery-brown, with a nice beige head and great lacing. The smell is rich and strong. A lot of malt and fruit is apparent, with some sharp qualities. The taste is rich also, with a dense sweetness mixed with some fruit. It's quite creamy and is very full bodied. Very drinkable, despite knocking you for a loop with the 10.5% ABV. I can't wait for next season!"
"High carbonation, fairly well-hidden ABV. Complex, unusual flavors make this a good choice for slow sipping."
"Super drinkability for the abv! This a interesting/complex, beautiful winter warmer that is helping fight off the chill here! One of the better x-mas begians I've tasted, If not the best"
"That nice complexity doesn't transfer to the palate, however. Sharp alcohol, black licorice and a strong medicinal taste preface a dry, powdery yeast finish. The carbonation is moderate and the body feels right, but I just never warmed up to this beer  and not for lack of trying."
"Quarter inch haed tha's gone in a minute. Very bark brown. Could smell this bad boy from 2 feet away. Light yeast, light bread, and light maltiness. Strong cherry, with maybe a hint of allspice and vanilla. Moderate alcohol taste. Good, but not outstanding as a ""Christmas"" beer."
"¡Salud!"
"Pours almost clear red-tinged chestnut. Little head and thin lace, but relatively good carbonation for a strong aged ale. Pretty strong smelling. Lots of alcoholic grape bubble gum, banana, black pepper in the nose. Bitter-sweet tasting. Heavy bubble gum stickiness vies uneasily against spiced medicinal alcohol notes. Some toasted malt shows through in the finish, but not enough to offset the tenacious bubble gum. Body is heavy and limp; sticky and not very exciting. I don't particularly enjoy the other Gouden Carolus beers, and this one is in the same mould."
"Smell and taste are exciting, but taste is actually unremarkable. However, the experience of a beer this drinkable and this strong is something to be sought. A near-perfect expression of the concept of very strong beers, suited for both the newcomer and the snob alike."
"¡Feliz Navidad!"
"952"
"What an amazing Christmas brew! I could easily drink this one year round. The flavors really come out at room temp but a slight chill will help mask the alcohol content."
"Poured this into my new AleSmith tulip that I received from b0ldfacelies -- a perfect vessel for a special Xmas beer. Cherry-blood bronze with a smooth and creamy dust-khaki foam cap. Aromas of overripe banana, nutmeg, clove, powdered ginger, cinnamon, farmyardy yeast funk, lemon zest and a finishing scent of earthy grain husks. Tart applesauce and raisin puree flavor mixed with mashed banana and a funky vegetal spiciness in the aftertaste -- sort of like brussels sprouts. Lingering ""country"" yeast flavors. Noticeable alcohol buzz all around the flavor and mouthfeel, but nothing that's too distracting from the overall taste experience. Surprisingly light in body for such a big, flavorful beer. Moderate alcohol slickness is barely perceptible, leading to extremely easy drinkability, especially given the big flavor and high alcohol content. In all, a very nice choice for a special holiday beer."
"Drinkability is very good. It would be very easy to drink too much of this even with the big alcohol presence. One of the preimiere Belgian seasonal brews."
"Drinkability - this is very good, but the high abv makes it not sessionable."
"Gouden Carolus Noel is one of the best Christmas beers that I've ever had the pleasure to drink. I'll have to check my reviews to be sure, but it might be the single best. I haven't yet completed my Christmas list this year. Given the fact that I've thorougly enjoyed the top half of this 750 (and can't wait to savor the bottom half), I'd have to say that a case of this incredible ale has just made its way to spot number one. I'm feeling pretty merry right now and expect to feel even merrier with each passing ounce. This is glorious, glorious beer."
"Full of malty complexity in both aroma and flavor. It seems there are some spice additions, but they are properly done and add complexity without standing out as spices. A great winter-time sipper."
"D: I love this beer. In a world of copy cat beers, this one stands out as unique. I can see how some dislike it though, perhaps too much licorice. Personally, I think its near perfect. One of the best Xmas beers ever made."
"D - Absolutely superb. Has the seasonal feel without being overbearing in its flavours. Far too easy to drink for the potency it has."
"Glad to find this on-tap at Ashley's. Served in a tall tulip glass. Dark ruby body with chestnut brown edges. Sticky, off-cream head. Nose is full of rich fruit and sugar malts adorned with light cloves, yeast, toffee, sugar cookies, and some vinous notes. Sweet and malty; dark fruits blend with sugary cookie malts. Yum. Mild and appropriate spices (clove, anise, and vanilla). Alcohol doesn't hide in this one, but it fits in nicely. Warming, but not boozy. Full-bodied, slightly syrupy feel. A very well done and not over-spiced xmas ale. Must make this a staple every December from here on out."
"Full bodied, creamy smooth, easy to drink, but this one is for sipping and savoring. Finishes still sweet but offset by the spices and substantial alcohol warmth. This one doesn't sneak up on you like some Belgian strong ales. You know the alcohol is there but it is just so smooth. Not an everyday beer but would be great after dinner on a cold winter day."
"D: Drinkable? Smooth and subtle, this is a wonderful example of the style. One of the most drinkable beers I've had. Abv goes completely unmasked, until it warms in the chest about three quarters of the way through the bottle."
"My first impression with this brew is that it is a dead ringer for Three Philosophers. I'd have to try them side by side, but the similarity is uncanny, with the sweet, almost cherry -like taste. Seems sweeter than the normal Gouden, but very good and quite warming. Dark, deep, and substantial. Not to be missed as a seasonal..."
"Damn , this stuff is good. This is a dessert beer....although I enjoyed it with roasted chestnuts...it would definitely stand up alone. Quite the brew."
"Drinkability- Let's see... I've been sipping and reviewing this beer for over an hour and a half. I still have ½ remaining in the bottle, with no desire for this tasting to end anytime soon. In a nutshell, it would be a tragedy to miss out on sampling this wonderful beer."
"yum yum"
"The head is khaki and short-lived, with a spotty lacing, like Indonesian islands all around the inside of your glass. Aroma is sweet and musty, like warm candy in the cellar, with a backbone of something sharp that slides through the fuzzy sweetness. Mouthfeel is smooth, creamy, just shy of thick, with alcohol burning along the edge. Taste is very complicated. I am picking up cherry, chocolate, a hint of coffee, a drumline of hops. The tongue is coated, at first, with sweetness, and ends with a tingle of hops. A nice, complicated, sip-through-the-Sunday beer."
"-Oelergud"
"D: A wonderful beer to sip on after dinner on a rainy, cool evening. Excellent flavor and balance make this a winner. Not just a winter beer - I give it a strong recommendation."
"Rich sweet malt and dark fruits flood the nose. There is a musky perfumey flourish as well. Body is a murky brown and holds two fingers of mocha thickness in the creamy, but bubbly, head. Fore is somewhat toasty with malts and there are mild sweet fruit flavors. Alcohol is fairly hot and assertive through the middle and the finish is midly bitter and almost tart and acidic. Some very mild spiciness as well. Overall a good beer, but doesnt tie things together nearly as well as the Carolus Classic."
"Updated August 19, 2013 - In the intervening seven years since I first reviewed this beer, my palate has gravitated more towards IPAs, than the darker, sweeter beers which I was formally so fond of, but even so, this beer is every bit as good as I remember it and definitely a classic."
"With this beer you can taste Christmas all year round!"
"Decent body. The alcohol is fairly well hidden beneath the spices. It stands to be much more drinkable without the medicinal phenols, but otherwise it is an excellent beer."
"Paired it with some smoked gouda and that worked well. However, I would choose something a bit more sharp next time."
"A sweet, smooth, complex, creamy holiday ale that I can't wait to drink again next holiday season."
"Mouthfeel- Good carbonation and a pretty light body make this beer very enjoyable. It is nice to notice the flavors change with each degree rise in temperature. The licorice flavor becomes more prevalent as the bheer warms."
"Whoa Boy!! This brew is not for the faint of heart. No, Nooo, its not a hop bomb to make ya shiver this is a malted, sweet black liquorice induced stong ale. Spicey edge (Ginger creeps in?) is the biggest seperation from the emperor. Cinnamon some sweetness that is dark, maybe some brown sugar. Sharp closure as the carbonation is snappy. Bigtime nightcapper material. Hits with a huge warming effect, Yum. A tinge of sour at the end in the aftertaste. Awww Fuck this is a goood beer."
"Quite a nice brew. Would enjoy a younger version to compare."
"Enjoyed every last drop."
"Drinkability: Nice winter warming, sipping brews and unwrapping presents beer."
"Mad Mex Robinson I'm going to say thanks to Nick, he's one of the bartenders/servers who has had experience working at the Sharp Edge Creekhouse. Needless to say I know he's a fan of Gouden Carolus Tripel and if he saw that they could get a keg of the Noel I'm sure he swayed somebody to make that decision. Appearance: Deep ruby brown light white bubbly effervescent head scattered lacing on the chalice. Aroma: Deep plum spiced nutmeg and other chirstmas spices infused with warming alcohol fruit notes of raisins and apples, nice. Taste: Strong sweetness layers of spice, fruit, and alcohol complexities. Not quite as solid as it has been in the bottle, but damn good nonetheless one of the best Belgian Christmas offerings. Mouthfeel: Medium bodied solid carbonation effervescent tickles the palate a bit. Drinkability: A winter warmer of a devine caliber draft was an experience definitely amazing in the bottle but still great flavorful experience on tap."
"Poured a dark brown/amber with about a finger of slowly dissipating head, leaving a couple millimeters of creamy head at the top. Little lacing while head dissipates, but considerable amount while being drunk. Very strong smells of cherries, spices like cinnamon and maybe some clove. Slight alcoholy sweet smell as well. Similar tastes, with loads of cherry and sweet alcohol. Mouthfeel is smooth, slight warmth from alcohol, with a sweet aftertaste. Fairly drinkable, one bottle is more than enough (as it is with most 750 mLs for me)"
"So close, but yet so far from being a great belgian Christmas beer..."
"Drinkability: this is a wonderful ""sittin' by the fire"" sipping type of beer. I finished the bottle in a little over an hour. Worth seeking this out."
"A strong and delicious Belgium ale with multi-faceted fruitiness: certainly dark fruit flavors (raisins, dates, etc) but also some light fruits as well, such as some appely sweetness up front and a touch of acidic green grape in the finish (just a hint though). Of course there is the robust, sugary maltiness with notes of caramel, toffee, and even chocolate. Thrown into the mix is a pleasant spice profile featuring nutmeg, cinnamon, and some clove. A sharp alcohol bite tops of this brews flavor pretty much from start to finish. Highly recommended!"
"Being that the Belgian brews are my favorites, I loved this one. It had a very dark and opaque amber/brown color with a nice head that faded rather quickly. I loved the aroma of the beer which had some cinnamon and nutmeg standing and also a slight fruitiness. I picked up a ton of molasses flavor with some berry notes along the aromatic flavor mentioned before. This is a truly exceptional beer and made my Christmas Eve evening a memorable one."
"750 mL cork-n-cage bottle that could be a year or two old as the label has some wear. Served in a Chimay chalice on Christmas eve. Pours a deep garnet with a 1 finger tan head that reduces to a quarter inch of creamy foam. Smells of holiday spices and some malts. The most prominent flavors are cinnamon and anise, but they're followed with spiciness, yeast, ginger?, clove?, and alcohol. Good spices, but not enough beer flavor. The body is medium to thick and it's easy enough to drink for the 10% beer it is, but I was expecting something more from my first winter Belgian."
"BB16-10-06. Good brown head and nice darkbrown almost black beercollor. Nose is very esterfruity making it into a bubblegum and bananamix. Some darkmalt arome comming trough aswell as some candy and high alcohol content obvious. Taste is sweet and alcoholic with good roastnote that goes well with the alcohol and bitterness aswell as a good nutty arome. Highly carbonated with it making taste even more bombastic but IMO very unbalanced to the sweet and alcoholic side. Certainly something else and drinkable but to me one glass is enough."
"Dark copper to brown in color. Very hazy with a light fluffy tan colored head. The nose is a mélange of toffee, nuts, dates, cinnamon, all spice and mild orange on the finish. The flavor is spice up front. Coriander, and orange peel. There is a lot of malt sweetness. Figs, dates, and toffee come through in the middle. Then some fresh bread. Mild bitterness throughout accentuated by the orange in the finish. This has a thinner mouth feel than the Cuvée Van De Keizer. A bit slick. Mild alcohol warming and a nice drinkability. Merry Christmas."
"drinkability: excellent. despite the high alcohol content, this beer could be drank, or sipped and enjoyed rather, until memorial day."
"i'm never going to drink wine again. why waste your time with that shit when there's beer out there like this. complex, powerful, creamy, bitter dry and strong. if i had to come up with any negatives, i would say this is perhaps a bit rummy. maybe it's intentional for the christmas style, but i taste rum and eggnog. not a bad thing at all. this is an excellent one to sip and quaff, sip and quaff ..."
"After the other 2 I tried, I wanted another of these."
"750 ml corked bottle. Gouden Carolus Noel pours out a dark brown color with a big tan head. The aroma is nutmeg, licorice, and fruit. Lots of licorice flavor in this beer, along with dark fruit and spices. A little caramel and some flavor that is sort of smokey. Surprisingly smooth mouthfeel. Alcohol is pretty well hidden. Great drinkability. This 750 ml bottle went down very easily, and it's at 10% abv. Perhaps not as complex as some Belgians, but the flavor is very nice anyway."
" Taste is really good. I usually steer clear of holiday spiced beers, but Brennan at Kahn's seemed pretty stoked to have this on the shelf, so I got two. This beer is heavily spiced, and I expect to buy more for cellaring until next year. Mouthfeel is heavy, and moderately carbonated. More drinkable than I expected, 750ml is no problem."
"D: A little on the strong side to drink more than one in an evening, but a wonderful winter beer nevertheless. This is one of my all-time favorites!"
"I probably couldn't have more than a couple of these, that cherry thing is weeeeird."
"This was a dark-amber pour, with a small head dissapating quickly. It smelled of cinnamo and sweet malt, with dark fruits and a lot of complex spiciness. The taste definitely confirmed all of this; lots of dark fruits and spices (cinnamon, nutmet, pepper), alcohol, hops, malt. The finish was once agin very smooth and crisp, pleasant, very warming."
"This is supposed to be an exceptional beer but I have to say that I was not that impressed. It had a nice dark red-brown color and good beige foam. But the smell was rather faint. The taste was sweet and fruit-candy like with a streak of must. Alcohol burn in the throat and some liqourice taste after a while. It's a beer that will not disappoint anyone but I think it lacks a distinctive character. Maybe I got a bad bottle?"
"2004 Bottle: Sample at WFM. Dark brown with a thin beige head and decent lacing. Lots of sweet malts and spices in the nose. The body is pretty chewy with more sweet malt, ginger and fruit flavors. The finish is flavorful, with more spices and a nice woody character. The alcohol is kept in check very well too, making for an enjoyable brew from start to finish."
"World class all the way."
"Abelgian corked beer in 3/4 of liter bottle; smell tarred scent, also presents displays fruity touch, carbolic too; full bodied taste, thickness, a little carameled; serve in a belgian goblet glass, try with variety of goat mexican cheese, a premium gourmet beer, try too with mexican haute cuisine, like appetizer; 90% recommended."
"Nice full velvety mouth, no oils left in its wake. Delicious. If it wasn't for the abv I could sip this in front of the fire all night."
"750 ml bottle, corked ""champagne"" style. ABV is 10.5%. Deep chestnut colour, large light tan head, nice lacing. Malty sweet and spicy aroma - aniseed, cardamom, ginger, nutmeg, cloves(?) Notes of oak and leather too. Flavour is also dominantly malty sweet (too sweet) with caramel and spices, a certain hoppy bite too. Alcohol is evident, but not overwhelming. A fairly complex beer, but too much malty sweetness keeps me from giving it a top rating."
"this is a huge beer, a special occasion beer. as far as their dark offerings go, het anker remains one of the top shelf belgian breweries doing business today."
"Beer is good. Happy beering."
"Even with all its finely set warming and spice this makes for a really nice drinker and an even finer treat. I'm becoming more of fan to these Noel/Winter Warmer-type brews and I'm thinking Winter isn't really that bad here in MN as long as I have this kind of beer around to keep me company."
"Overall, a pretty fine winter sipping Belgian strong dark ale, but the black licorice/anise component is somewhat overdone."
"Pours a cloudy leathery brown with a bubbly tan head that flattens out and breaks up across the surface of the body. Sweet candied aroma with a pleasant fruitiness. There's some yeast and anise in the nose also. Mouthfeel is full-bodied with moderate carbonation. Sweet molasses-like front with a nice candied fruitiness to it. Bready malt steps up right behind it. Black licorice follows. Somewhat sour and vinous finish has some very subtle and slight chocolate tones to it. Alcohol is masked nicely when chilled, but becomes more noticably when the ale warms to room temperature. This is a nice Chirstmas/Winter brew to warm the heart during the cold winter months."
"Arrives with a 1/4"" beige head above the dark caramel-hued brew. Head is somewhat short-lived, yet exhibits good lacing. Aroma is sweet malts with an alcohol tinge. Taste follows the nose, with spicy Belgian notes. Mouthfeel and drinkability both excellent. Excellent holiday brew."
"ABV is well hidden, so use caution when drinking."
"Large bottle, cork and cage, pours dark brown, murky and cloudy, dark tan head, good retention and well developed sticky lacing. Nose is strongly anise, ginger, alcohol and burnt fruits. this is a lovely and complex BSDA. Alcohol evident, warming. Notes of dark sugars, burnt fruit, smoke, vanilla, bananas, jam, dark malt. This strong brew has it going on in many directions. Fine winter treat."
"Drinkability- Very new and odd taste to me, but was fantastic. I will be looking for this one in a bottle if I can find it around here. Glad I venutred off my path to try this one at $7.00 a glass."
"($8.09 / 25.4 oz corked and caged champagne style bottle)"
"Still a very nice and drinkable belgium that I would buy again."
"The beer came in a handsome 750 ml. bomber with the obligatory wire cage and cork. As the cork was pulled the wonderful aromas of cherry, brown sugar, and slightly grass hops filled the air. The pour revealed the body to be quite dark brown, with a small head that was short lived. The carbonation level was quite low. The taste was spicy, roasty, and not the least bit boozy. Brown sugar, cinnamon, mint, and nutmeg were the stars of the show here followed by a crackling dry hoppy finish. Mouthfeel was full but not overbearingly so. The alcohol was sneakily hidden under these layers. This is good craftsmanship."
"750 ml corked and caged, Dark and cloudy reddish-brown in color, big thick clingy brown head, sweet fruity and bready aroma, full bodied, alcohol hidden very well, smooth and velvety mouthfeel, finishes a little sweet, this is a great Belgian ale, very drinkable and tasty."
"Drinkability: Anything this unbalanced, and/or requiring three hours to grow on you in order to appreciate it is not drinkable to me."
"Overall: Superb, excellent value for money Christmas Ale from Belgium and definitely worth picking some up for the Cellar, I suspect a year will take a little off of the alcoholic edge that it displays right now. Powerful and Fruity right now but Im sure this will mellow into a beautifully smooth mature monster with 12 months cellaring under the belt."
"Dark rum colored with a small beige ring of bubbles. Complex aromas; star anise, prune, gingerbread, an all-round malty and spicy smelling beer, even down to the subtle hopping which comes across herbal and minty. This is one syrupy muther of a beer. Good thing it is amply carbonated to keep the maltiness of the beer in check. It does retain a slickness on the tongue. Flavors abound similar to the aroma; but more molasses and brown sugar come through in its heavy maltiness. The finish gets drier and more medicinal as all the flavors meld together. A nice Christmas offering."
"Glistening varnished wood look with a blistering tan head. A slick, not-quite-sweet assortment of licorice fragrances. Jagermeister, plum skins, dried roots, and cooked brown sugar highlight the aroma. Baked woodchips and sweetened caramel malt are initial notable flavors on the palate. Allspice and cardamom, some roasted chocolate, and rich, dark pumpernickel. Just spicy enough to fit the Xmas beer mold but not wild or outlandish. A solid holiday beer for anyone."
"Overall, this was a wonderful winter warmer, even on a warm afternoon in SoCal. Deliciously complex and great to look at, Gouden Carolus Noël is one holiday ale worth going to great lengths to try."
"Mahogany in color with a creamy tan head. Nice lacing after each sip. The aroma is malty sweet and spicy. It has a anise and nutmeg aroma, along with a bit of mint. It has some oily, resiny aromas as well. The flavor is malty with the nutmeg and anise. It has a hidden Anchor OSA flavor to it. Kinda resiny and piney. It is smooth and creamy. It is medium-full in body and very easy drinking for its strength. Very nice."
"On tap at Lucky Baldwin's, it's reddish-brown with a thick tan head. The smell is a tantalizing mix of dark ripe fruit, sugary candy, and spice. The taste of plum and grape bounce off anise and hints of cardamom. It has a a nice, chunky mouthfeel. This was my first beer of the evening (on an empty stomach). Neither the smell or taste hinted at the 10.5% abv. However, the warming effect and rush of alcohol to the head told a different story. The whole affair seems like a nice take-off on Grand Cru of the Emperor. It's most certainly another winner from Anker."
"I am a fan of all other Het Anker beers, so hard to fault this for anything other than personal preference, which makes this review harder. Will review again in a few weeks then again in a year or two, but this I will need to warm up to a bit. A great candidate for cellaring and I'm sure that the strong anise will die down after a long cold conditioning."
"This is a gorgeous beer."
"Just a hinted swirl of carbonation to begin, with more piling up on the edges. Claret, thick brown hue that echoes. Juicy plums, raisins, and juniper on nose, with a touch of port-like sweetness. Lovely malt gush with a brown sugar melt on the tongue. Lucious overall, and one I would gladly order up continuously throughout the holiday season, and beyond."
"The beer pours a deep dark brown color with a 1/4"" tan head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is great. It has a dry, yet quite fruity scent that boasts of pale and crystal malts along with many spices and a yeasty finish. The taste is good. It has a sweet and fruity malt flavor that goes down easy and finishes dry, creamy, and a bit warm. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a damn good brew. It has excellent flavor and aroma; a good drinker."
"Another excellent brew from Anker."
"Take the time to find one every year."
"Cloudy dark brown, good off-white film, fully lasting. Spicy nose, christmas spruce, minty. Mild alcohol comes through, but youd never guess 10%. Spiced old ale reminiscent. Very yeasty, cloves, maybe chocolate, christmas cake fruitiness+prunes+dates and other dark fruits, leafy, coffeeish. Complex like most of its kind. Red licorice and toffee malt sweetness, very tea-like in mouth, lemon notes. Fluffy heavy body, high carbonation...Marvellous christmas beer, stylish and flavorful. Props to you Larry!"
"750 ml bottle. I've had this puppy in cold storage for quite some time just waiting for the right chance to open it."
"Carefully poured, it's deep ruby body is just slightly hazy and appears almost brown beneath its full head of frothy tan foam. The head retention is quite good and it leaves some very nice lace as well. The nose is rich and exciting but not overtly bold, revealing more and more of itself with each sniff. Cola (cardamom) is evident upfront, backed by a note of sweet black licorice (from star anise) and some prune-like fruit. Nutmeg and cinnamon creep in along with some tropical fruit, the suggestion of caramel and cocoa, and a splash of thin alcohol. It's lightly tingly across the tongue with an exceptionally fine, median carbonation and a medium light body. In the flavor, fruit is initially suggested with a combination of berries, cherries, pluums, and tropical notes that quickly become drenched in cola syrup. Chocolatey notes approach but hesitate to actually make an entrance; and sweet anise becomes dominant at the swallow. Alcohol skirts around the edges as well, always present but without ever really making itself known. It finishes dry but with the suggestion of sweetness, similar to molasses; and with a light dusting of ginger and peppery spiciness. Quite remarkable! As complex as it is, it's actually very focused. An impressively spiced holiday ale that deserves a place at the dinner table: working equally well as an apertif, mid-meal accompanyment with a wide variety of dishes, balancing dessert beer, after-dinner drink or night-cap. A brilliant diamond in the rough!"
"A good one here."
"Probably my last Belgian Noel for the year (sadness), but what a one to end with! This is one hell of a beer! Can't wait for next year."
"75cl Corked bottle No date. Poured a hazy deep amber color with a thin tan head which settled to a thin film. Aroma has a sugary sweetness to it, some bready malt and fruit overtones. Alcohol shows up as it warms. Has a medium body that is smooth with a crispy finish. Flavor is sweet with malt almost barley style. Some fruit and a bit of spiciness also detectable. Overall not a bad seasonal."
"Though very interesting, this beer was very hard to drink. Maybe it would be easier if consumed with some red meat, but it's certainly not a sipping beer."
"A tasty beer, and one of the best Christmas beers. A big, strong, and impressive beer."
"It takes me a lot of examination to figure out the procession of tastes in this one, mostly because the licorice/anise wallop covers up some of the secondary tastes. The first stage is well-rounded, and when I look beyond the blast of licorice I see that this comes from the overtones of bitter caramel and syrupy fruitiness. The second stage is highly carbonated and laden with anise. The finish is extremely dry and tingly, with a smoldering finish way on the back of my tongue. Again, there's some molasses in there, but it's almost smoky in its texture. It's also tangy but not overly sugary or cloying; it reminds me of bitter apricots. The bottle says that it ages well, and given the tastes I just experienced I'll bet that's true. I plan to get a few bottles of this and open them next year to see if the hard edges on this beer have been rounded out. If so, it will move up in my estimation from very good to excellent."
"Very good brew."
"The finish grows drier as spices take over finishing with the growing heat of ginger combined with alcohol."
"Recommended at any age."
"(I cannot wait to see how this one ages; I'm afraid I'll have to ask my girlfriend to hide the key to the cellar, lest I prematurely break open one or more of the eight bottles of Gouden Carolus Christmas I've stashed there...)"
"Tawny port and alcohol nose that opens to a wildly sticky sweetness reminiscent of toffee and candy corn. This beer is held together by a solid bittering and light graininess that isn't as yeasty as most Belgians. The finish has a touch of alcohol and spice, perhaps licorice. Gouden Carolus is an angry mother -- punishing, bitter, and firm, but ultimately warm and sweet."
"PS: LOL at my original 2003 comment that only 22 BAs had reviewed it. It's like over 200 now."
"The taste; a rich brew, though light bodied given its 10.5% alcohol by volume, by no means light though. There is some definite spiciness here, seems like some coriander along with some other spices have been used, though because this beer is so rich and fruity it may just be the Belgian yeast character. This beer finishes with a definite alcoholic bite, though it is not overbearing and goes well with the spice notes. Lightly sweet with raisin and other dark fruit notes are in the fore front of this beer. There is no real bitterness, the spices and alcohol counter-point the sweetness and fruity flavors. This beer is incredibly good, and incredibly under-rated. I am certainly going to get a couple more bottles of this to age, next winter these could be stunning. This is just a damn good winter seasonal beer, certainly the best I have had yet this year."
"finish is long and sweet. perhaps a bit flabby, but good nonetheless."
"Drinkability: not my favorite of all the christmas beers but a fine drink nonetheless."
"This belgian beer was hardcore. This poured a nice dark golden/amber colour with a huge cap of white foam. The aromas were of alcohol, and were medicinal and spicy. The taste was spicy with a strange after-taste. The mouthfeel was just right and the drinkability was decent. This was an interesting belgian x-mas beer to say the least!"
"Dark brown with a snapping, dissipating head. Big alcohol aroma that's port-like. Some butter, herbal and fruitiness. Semi-prickly start on the palate, smoothing into a big malt character of caramel, toffee and coffee. Notes of grape. Spicy alcohol. Dry, yeasty finish. Warming."
"This beer has a murky muddy brown appearance. A slight beige head sits on top. Lacing is only adequate. The aroma has a sweet rock candy like presence. Very inviting. A little malt as well and hints of alcohol. This beer is nicely put together. Many layered complexities emerge through the drinking process. First, the alcohol makes its presence. But that takes a backseat in no time at all as the waves of candy, fruit and malt take over. But then the alcohol comes back and stays for the duration. Signs of wood and yeast come and go as well. But the alcohol taste is the mainstay, and for that reason, I dock the drinkability and give it an avg. rating in that department. The lingering bitter alcohol taste is not pleasurable. Looking past that one minor fault, I'd say this is pretty good, but I'd not spend the big bucks for it again."
"Brilliantly clear deep crimson hue. Ominously thick, stiff tan head with rounded peaks leaves parallel bubble rings interconnected by web like lace. Banana esters and ripe cherry like fruit dominate the aroma, w/ notes of mellow carob and dark caramel malt secondary. Hints of spicy cinnamon and ginger surface as the beer breathes. Chocolate laced sweetness upfront in flavor leads into a malt profile comprised of biscuit and butter contrasted by a light fruity melange of woody maple syrup and dried date notes. Sweetness takes on a molasses note mid palate and couples with the subtle ripe banana esters to lend a brown sugar sprinkled banana split impression. Hop bitterness struggles to assert itself, but soundly loses to resounding, yet judicious malt sweetness. Medium bodied and superbly smooth in mouthfeel. Finishes w/ a fading light caramel and bittersweet chocolate combination. Carolus Noel is a delicious brew. Its rich, yet simple malt character, stately fruitiness and well controlled residual sweetness lend it superlative drinkability. A perfect brew for a five degree Fahrenheit Kansas night."
"This beer poured a deep reddish amber color and formed a light tan bubbly head that left some circular lace. Quite a bit of carbonation is present. An aroma of malt, caramel, spices and dark fruit. A flavor of malt, caramel and fruits. Some elements of spices such as cinnamon and nutmeg are also present. A very heavy flavor presence to this beer."
"A slightly hazy deep reddish-brown in color, with a cream-colored head that disappears quickly. Very nice aroma. Many spices are present. Belgian candy sugar, clove, nutmeg, cinnamon, even some eggnog. Banana and yeast spiciness also play a part. Alcohol is noticeable. Quite complex. On to the flavors. Cloves, candy sugar, and sweeter winter spices (nutmeg and cinnamon) are noticeable at first. Yeast spiciness comes in next, along with some bready malt and alcohol. I think I'm picking up some caramel malt as well. It's such a complex brew, it's hard to pick out everything. Definitely Christmasy. Full-bodied and rich. Nice and smooth in the mouthfeel department. Excellent brew! It could definitely be cellared for a while. My mom bought this bottle for me for Christmas. It's very much appreciated and enjoyed!"
"Murky brown color, like the Ohio River in the spring. Head thicker and more dense than your average Denny's Nightime Dishwasher. (Sorry..that was uncalled for.) Smell was super smooth and rich. Full of fruits, and traditional Christmas spices. First taste was a rich combination and ample amounts of plums, figs, earthy fruits and a bottle and a half of cinnamon. Taste stayed creamy and rich. Sediment swirl yeiled anouther explosion of smells.Christmas in a bottle about sums it up. Alcohol sneeks by at 10.5%, but at one point was just shy of Cherry Nyquil. I guess you could say, slightly medicinal. Not a bad thing at all, IMO. This bottle got better and more flavorful as the night went on. Took me about 2.5 hours to drink, and savor. Medium bodied, perfectly carbonated, and super smooth. A Christmas beer to enjoy. Cheers to all the ba's who tried this before."
"Beautiful clear dark mahogany color with a 1/4"" brownish head that sinks to a thick, creamy film that has a nice lacing effect on the glass. Huge sweet maltiness with big dark candy sugar aspects in the nose. Some very nice, and nicely subtle, fruity and spicy qualities. Getting some light nutmeg and cinnamon along with some nice fig and raisin aromas. Big sweet candy maltiness all over the tongue right off the bat. Lightly spiced fruits in the background. Some nice cinnamon, nutmeg, and peppery spices with some tasty raisins and light baked apple dumpling characteristics. Slightly thin body through the middle of the brew before finishing with a nice malty sweet flourish that is accompanied by a nice warming alcohol quality. Warm and tasty but a little thin in the middle that drops the mouthfeel a bit. An excellent brew with good warming qualities for the cold Holiday season. The slightly lighter aspects of the brew lend to an even better drinkability. I could both drink several of these and would definitely be willing to get a few more at a later date. An excellent brew and worthy of a purchase if you see it. A big thanks to Bill at the Alexandria Whole Foods for letting me sample this one and enticing me to buy it."
"Wow, a really nice holiday treat. Deep brown-ruby-ginger in color, with an inviting tan head that fades to wispy laces across the surface. How to describe the smell? Anise definitely comes to mind, and mince meat pie. There's a fresh loaf of cinnamon bread baking in the background as well. There's anise in the taste (or maybe horehound?), definitely caramel-sweet, with a spicy, peppery alcohol finish. Nice. Keeps you warm and toasty, and is worthy of sharing with close friends in front of the fire."
"Big hazy ginger brown with a large bottle-conditioned tan head (in a Duvel glass)...laces are thick rings with underhanging tracks. Very fruity aroma, lots of cling peaches and syrup and definite ginger impressions. Wow, smooth as a molasses cookie with a mulled pear cider, counterpointed by a crisp but non-assertive hopping. Aftertaste is just slightly vinous with continuing fresh fruit and ginger. This puppy is a fine holiday brew, a little on the hepped-up alcohol but nice light-medium body, lower carbonation, and fresh flavors."
"Aftertaste & mouthfeel: Fruity flavour keeps fruit-acids as characteristic. palate is rather thinnish, but with a throat-warming alcohol effect."
"On the pour, the beer appears to be a somewhat caliginous cherry red color, the head Bunyanesque in size, the texture creamy, with sticky sheets of lace to caress the glass. Nose is fruit sweet, over ripe apples and or banana comes to mind, malt tones and light caramel hints also present a treat for the old honker to sniff. The start is honey sweet, the top lean, the finish is pleasantly acidic, cheerfully hopped, dry and somewhat alcohol bitter aftertaste. Yes, it does Warm the Tummy, and should definitely be put in the Winter Warmer category. If you like strong high ABV beer this is a must try, but you may find it a bit pricey at $10.49 a 750ml bottle. Personally I dont mind the price, because Im Worth It Baby!"
