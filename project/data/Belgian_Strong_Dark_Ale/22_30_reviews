"Very strange beer, tastes like wine to me... not my thing"
""
""
""
"Pours murky, muddy brown. Raisins, and plum dominate the aromas. Palate is thick and slightly sticky. Tastes are the aforementioned raisins and plums, but some up front mint is on the tongue too. Maybe a bit of sweet molasses on the swallow. A good solid craft brew, but the hyperbole swirling around this one, exceeded the actual experience of drinking it."

"Glass- Goblet"
"Overall - Just a really expertly put together BSDA. Very complex, very smooth and dangerously drinkable for its heft like any big Belgian worth its salt should be. Great beer - stands up there with anything from Belgium in my book."
"Pours cola in color with a big billowy head with great retention and leaving curtains of lace.  The nose comes with some toasted malts, dried fruits and yeast.  The taste is dominated by that wonderful ‘Belgian’ profile of yeast, bread, candied sugar and caramel.  The high carbonation keeps this 9%’er highly drinkable."
""
"I'm a relatively new reviewer so pardon the simplicity. Look:  a very deep coffee/dark chocolate brown.  2 finger tan head that lasted 2 mins on the tulip.  Smell:  very rich-- again some chocolate and sweetness.  Taste was awesome as I'm a big fan of smoothness over bitterness.  This 9%'er nailed it and had a sweet spice aftertaste that made me want more. Overall, great deep and smooth flavors that (along with La Fin du Monde) has made this newbie a fan of Unibroue."
""
"3/22/15 (Bottle) - Excellent dark pour with a nice white tan pillow head. Several fruits including raisins, cinnamon as well as caramel and others. Very pleasant taste, light texture and mild carbonation, but heavy kick and ABV - you feel it after drinking."
""
"Final Score: Poor it down the Drain."
"Drank an entire 750ml bottle.  Pours a copper reddish brown with big carbonated head that lingers.  Not dark like a stout.  Opaque.  Aromas of fruit such as raisins or plums.  Slight hint of spices such as cinnamon, nutmeg maybe.  Tastes extremely smooth for a Belgian dark ale.  You'll taste the raisins or plums, cinnamon and sugars.  Not sweet though.  Very mild and abv is unnoticeable even though at 9.  Easy drinking beer you can enjoy over a long sporting event.  Excellent BDA."
"Great beer. I've had it a few times this week and it definitely hits the spot. good game to slowly drink on to last you through those March Madness games, and will help you relax in those tense ot's"
"So here's why i say deceptive. There is no real alcohol  blast at the finish. This does not bring the Belgi-funk hard even though it is bottle conditioned. It may just be an ideal intro to the genre of Belgian Strong Dark - but beware. This smooth, drinkable brew sits at 9ABV, so perhaps have some poutine before hand."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - A rock solid rendition of a BSDA.  Quite full and robust."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Medium body, bold dark fruit and just sweet enough. Very easy to drink. The fact that it is relatively easy to get is a real bonus."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"12oz bottle poured into tulip. Very dark brown with a half-finger of tan head that recedes to a ring and some cells of bubbles. Smells of cherries, chocolate, brown sugar, caramel, bread, and fig. Taste is grassy, pear and apple on warming, cherries, figs, dates, spicy alcohol notes, and grains. Medium-full body, oily and creamy texture, lively carbonation, dry and spicy finish. Definitely improves as it warms."

"-great beer one of my favorites from this brewery love the flavor and how long it lasts while not being overpowering"
"Trois Pistoles pours a lovely brown color with red highlights. It's topped by a soda like head that is retained fairly well as one sips. I found the aroma to contain nice elements of Belgian yest and dark fruits. The flavor has wonderful fruit esters of apple, pear, cranberry, and black cherries. It's smooth, bready, and balanced and has a nice spicy finish - maybe a bit of clove? Hardly any alcohol heat is perceptible. Overall, it's a superb pleasure to drink!"
""
""
"Unibroue never fails to impress! It has that distinctive yeast flavouring with great malty greatness. It just coats your mouth in luxury. The high ABV is not noticeable until about 2/3 of the bottle is enjoyed! Good game!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"On draft at Ordinary in New Haven Ct. Wonderful smell of cherries and plums. 1/4 inch head that dissipated over time. Dark color like a stout. The taste blew me away. Sweet, a slight slight hint of tartness but the sweet over takes its. Mouthfeel is perfect. Doesn't coat the mouth. Great beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"Blended absolutely perfect! One of my favorite beers ever!"
""
"Wow, this is a fantastic brew!"
""
""
"Not a huge fan of Belgians....but this is a good one.  The beer pours dark with thick white head....but no lace.  The scent and taste are common to Belgians.  Overall its worth a try."
"Overall: Belgian beers have never been my favorite - probably because of the yeast and dark fruits. This is pretty much what this beer takes after. And it does a good job at that."
""
"I earned this one after 3 1/2 hours of shoveling the driveway and raking the roof. Trois Pistoles by Unibroue of Quebec, one of the best breweries in the world.  This is a ""dark ale on lees"" (meaning the leftover sediment and dead yeast - don't let that turn you off) with spices. Smell is heavy with dark fruits, like prunes and raisins, and some pepper. Nearly pitch black color with nice head. Taste is smooth and heavily malty with the same dark fruits but minimal pepper. No hops detected here even though I know they're there. Very smooth mouthfeel with a sweetness that lingers. At 9% ABV it is a true sipper."

"first beer from unibroue. very good"
"I think the bottle I got was a little under carbonated but overall it's a great beer"
""
""
""
""
"O: Outstanding Belgian dark ale. More session able (even at 9%) abv than most Belgian strong dark ales. The funky tart finish is what makes this my favorite Unibroue ale. Worth cellaring to see if it improves - their website suggests 5 years."

""
""

"V - Good Value."
""
"A very unique blend of flavors."
""
"stumble upon it at the bar its very good"
"I'm surprised that the initial head seems more bubbly than I expect, but it fades quickly to a light cap of foam.  Clean on the glass with no lace.  Aroma is lacking.  I get a hint of what I would expect from a BSDA, but little more.  And the taste.  If I were to do this blind I seriously doubt I could distinguish this from any of my favorite Belgian ales in this category.  Perfect balance.  Bready with dark fruit mixed in.  Nice.  Excellent carbonation and medium body.  Finish is just barely dry.  Just enough.  Maybe a touch thin."

"The reputation brought this beer to my home. I found it to be repugnant.  Very little carbonation, boozy, wine like finish. It tasted like old cellar stored raisin wine. Maybe because I am in Hawaii but I found it to be putrid."
""
""
""
""
""
"Has that Belgium taste but bland.  Not a big fan of the ""fruit"" in this one."
"  Taste is everything you want in a dark Belgian strong...sweet, smooth with a little spicy bite...dry finish...super easy to drink for a 9%'r...dangerous and delicious!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A well made beer. Nicely integrated flavors, aroma, and mouthfeel. Smells of overripe bananas and tastes like root beer."
""
""
"One of my favorites, great fruit and spice notes"
""
"Very easy on the buds. Strong , but not an  overpowering fruit sensation . All and All an pleasure to drink"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The main thing I would point out is how easy this is to drink.  Really smooth.  Unreal how easy this is to drink for a strong dark belgian which is my favorite style.  Comes off as a light version, with the texture and ease to drink but still pack the taste and the ABV.  Overall an excellent beer that I hope to enjoy very often.  If I had to only drink one beer forever I would not be averse to this being the one.  Plus, for $7 a bomber this in an unbelievable value."

"FURTHER UPDATE - Another four pack yielded nothing but pure bliss. BSDA are probably my favorite style, and this is probably my favorite of that style. I had to bump my ratings up another .25."

"Great beer - I enjoy this almost as much as La Fin du Monde."
""
"Taste shows such a soft, brown bread and malt interplay. It is just fantastic to go back to a beer like this after always trying to pursue the latest limited release. The yeast is fantastically complex, with both fruit, bread and cloves all coming to the forefront. Excellent beer. If Unibroue cant ride out the current hop/sour/limited local craze, then there is no hope for humanity :)..."

"Overall -  Still a world class beer, rich and full of flavor, however I had been expecting this to challenge La Fin Du Monde as my favorite Unibroue beer ever. Unfortunately, it can't quite live up to those expectations, however still something enjoyable that is perfect for a cold Sunday in November."

"43/50"

"O: This beer is a spectacle. It has everything you could want out of the style, and then just shows off for good measure. Quite possibly the pinnacle of Unibroue."
""
"Overall: Well done Belgian Dark. It reminds me of a dense brown bread studded with dried fruits."

""
""

""
""
""
""
""
"Look, Smell, and Taste were all rated at 4.5  The feel I only gave it 2 due to  the over-carbonation (too fizzy).   That was the initial taste and letting it sit for a while."
""
"Overall - I could drink this year round; truly an outstanding brew!"
"O: This is a very full bodied and complex beer. It has many different flavors from fruitiness to maltiness along with the typical spice and yeast notes that most Belgian styles usually possess. Alcohol is slightly detectable on the nose, but is masked very well when it comes to the taste and mouthfeel. An excellent representation of the style that I will surely be having again."
"Fruity taste. Not much carbonation. Amazing Belgian Ale coming out of Canada."
""
"O: Unibroue knows its Belgian ales, that is indisputable. This is one of the finer offerings along those lines I've had, and I come back to it time and again. Should I ever get to Belgium itself to sample ales from the source, my opinion may change, but until then - bravo, Quebecois!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I am really starting to like what Unibroue has to offer. 750mL poured into a Unibroue chalice. A: Pours a dark brown color with a 1 finger tan head. Head quickly fades to a ring, a little swirl of the glass excites the brew causing some nice lacing. N: Aroma is of bread malts, plum, red grape and pears. P: The aroma accentuates the taste giving you a mildly carbonated dark fruit and malty smooth mouthful. Followed by a slight and pleasant alcohol after taste. O: I really enjoyed this brew. The flavors coming through make this almost like a dessert brew. It's not too filling so it's easy to drink. A very enjoyable Belgian style Dark Ale."
"Not an Ale Fan-this one has a nice color but weak taste, not much aroma. would not purchase again"
"From 2009. It certainly aged well! Lots of cola flavors. Not much carbonation left, but not flat either. You wouldn't think a 5 year old beer could be this awesome."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Taste / Palate: Like the aroma it’s flavor follows in its footsteps. The has a good full body with loads of malty, yeasty and dark fruitiness. I also get nice mild notes of vanilla extract along with some alcohol which adds another nice layer of complexity. Mouth feel is smooth and full with lots of soft carbonation."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"500ml bottle. Nice herb aroma. Pours black with tan head. Medium sweet taste. Full bodied with creamy texture and average carbonation. Very good strong beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"Wonderful brew pours dark with a off white head. Toasted coconut undertones in both smell and taste. Feels creamy, thick, and has such a balance between hoppy and sweet, that it almost feels like a dessert."
"Superb beer, plus a unique flavor and aroma like few beers I've had, this beer deserves more love. 4.2"

"o: my favourite from unibroue, an absolute treat. this 4-pack is nearly a year and 8 months old, so i'd like to re-review this when it's fresh. do yourself a favour and grab some of this beer because it's incredible"

"The main thing that ticks me off about this beer is if it gets shaken in the very slightest way in a bottle it'll foam like a volcano when you open it...wasting most of the beer. It foams like crazy too! A slight shaking in any manner will make it seem like you opened a bottle of beer you JUST vigorously shaked like crazy! And it's not cheap so seeing it fuzz like crazy after a simple car ride and losing half a bottle is annoying!"

"Bucky bought a 6 pack of Unibroue's Trois Pistoles at The Beer Store for $14.95... about $2.50 per 341 ml bottle. Trois Pistoles was 9.0% alcohol by volume, with a production date of September 11, 2011 printed on the neck. This particular bottle has been sitting in my cold seller for about 14 months. A warning for those of you who have aged your Trois Pistoles for a while...about two seconds after you open the bottle a whole lot of foam will come gushing out of the bottle, so be ready with the glass. Trois Pistoles poured a dark mahogany colour, with about 2"" of fizzy beige head that faded to a thin cap and collar within 3-4 minutes, leaving a little spotting down the glass. Its aroma was fabulous...plums, powdered sugar, pink bubble gum and red wine. The beer's taste began with sweet ripe plums and raisins, which gave way to powdered sugar and pink bubble gum, ending with a red wine flavour which lingered for a few seconds as an aftertaste. There's very little bitterness here, but beer's sweetness is kept under control. The 9.0% alcohol is very well hidden, both in the aroma and the flavour. The mouth feel is smooth with the carbonation being much softer than previous Unibroue beer's that I've sampled...possibly as a function of being cellared? I'll have to try a fresh bottle some time for the answer to that question. Trois Pistoles is a medium bodied brew. The verdict...yet another winner from the good folks at Unibroue, and the price is not unreasonable. Looking forward to trying the remaining bottles after they have aged even more!"

"Another beer that drinks more like a wine. Belgian influence is clear. Though not my typical style, I enjoyed this beer. I wouldn't necessarily choose it over say something with more of a hop presence."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Has some characteristics of a Belgian abbey beer as well as a Scotch ale. Whatever it is works well."
""

"Pours nearly black with a bubbly light brown head that lasts and lasts. Smells of plum and yeast. Both carry over to the taste, along with alcohol. Just a touch of sourness. Medium mouth with lots of carbonation. The aftertaste doesn't linger long. This isn't a bad beer, but it's not my favorite style."

"Dark fruit and spices dominate the flavor. This is a solid Belgian dark."
"Poured into a Chimay goblet, it came out a deep slightly cloudy ruddy brown. A small amount of light gets through towards the bottom. A nice thick off-white head settles in at about half a finger and lasts well throughout the beer. The aroma is rich with spices, alcohol esters, and dark fruit sweetness. The taste is a little less explosive, but mirrors the aroma closely, spice and fruit in the forefront and a little bit of alcohol in the background. It wasn't as heavy as I expected given its big aroma and taste, but it certainly isn't lacking. This is a delicious Belgian-style dark ale."
""
""
"O: Very nice. It is an unusual interpretation of a belgian strong dark ale. Cant wait to try this again. It is a pity that this isn't being imported to Brazil."

"Probably my favorite dark Unibroue offering. Has some wine-like qualities and I love how it flirts with malty sweetness without getting syrupy or cloying. The smoothness is a little dangerous at 9%, but makes it a perfect after dinner beer or nightcap sipper."
"O: A lot of people seem to dislike Unibroue's yeast profile - I'm not one of them. As always from Unibroue, the alcohol is concealed marvelously, without sacrificing anything in the way of richness or depth. Thank cripes this is very readily available, because I'll definitely drink this again."
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured from a bottle into a plastic running water bottle--just fished a 5-mile training run and no glassware in sight. Develops a 2cm tan head, then thick clinging lacing. Te aroma is incredible--plums, figs, malt, a bit of hops. The flavor is very rich with dark roasted malt, fruit, and hops. The mouthfeel is the only part that I an not extatic about--it's a bit too foamy for me. Overall a truly outstanding ale that I am very glad to have sampled."
"Overall, this one just doesn't stack up to other BSDAs that I've had the chance to sample--not even Unibroue's other offering in the style, Maudite. Admittedly, they are very different takes on a somewhat broadly interpretable style, but I would choose that one over this one any day of the week. Luckily, they do enough other outstanding beers that this one doesn't bother me--you can't be perfect all of the time."
""
""
""
"O: Much too sweet for the style, the yeast esters are excellent but a little overpowering. I typically expect a dryer finish, a little more body, and WAY less carbonation."

"12oz bottle into clean tulip glass, looks superb! Dark mohagany with a light brown-white head. Little spice on the nose, as well as the palate. Dark fruits as well as a little nuttiness throughout. Very smooth for the abv, Unibroue is very unique with the packaging which adds a little to the stigma of this Dark Ale. Great brew, cheers!"

"This is one of my all time favorite Belgian ales and was a gateway beer for me when it comes to the whole craft brewing phenomenon. To call any beer flawless is a tall order, but I must confess I have a really difficult time identifying any here."

"Overall, a pretty great beer. Carb is a litttle higher than most belgian darks. great for the price too. Hard to find ""cheaper"" Belgians"

"O: Quite drinkable, super fruity, and interesting flavors which integrate very nicely. Not entirely unlike some sort of fruit cola. Very good stuff."
"This is my favorite Unibroue brew. There’s complexity and everything works together. There’s nice fruit flavor, but not too much sweetness. Alcohol is extremely well hidden. The carbonation scrubs at the palate leaving a lighter body than what one may expect. This drinks easily, almost like a dark cherry soda. I would argue it stands up against classic Belgian brews and even better than Rochefort 8, comparable brew."
""
""
""
""
""

"pours nice and heavy, i got a small half finger head. Scent is nice and sweet, with some earthy tones like a damp fall forest in New England. almost like run rasin on the nose, with a little nutty finish. Taste was great, lots of malt and lots of raisin almost a sweet pumpkiny carrot cake sweetness that finishes with a mild tart. excellent beer, i really really love Unibroue and seem to fall deeper into their beers after each dabble."
"From start to finish it's impossible to find a flaw in this beer's characteristics. Distinct notes of plum and a satisfying body allow this beer to be drank with multiple foods, but I'll always remember my first time as the best."
"12 oz. bottle from Gator Beverage in Gainesville. Pours a deep dark brownish purple with a nearly two finger creamy off white to khaki head. Big time dark fruit aroma , candy sugar, molasses, spicy Belgian yeast funk, as expected. Flavor is sweet and fruity up front with plums, cherries, pears, raisins. The finish ends with a good bit of spices that linger and play around with the sweet fruits on the tongue afterward. Medium heavy body with medium carbonation. Plenty of body but not chewy, which makes this plenty drinkable and pleasant. Nice for dessert or for anything else. Excellent BSA and there is a reason it is up there with the best of the style. Right on with all the flavors."

"This appeals to me with a bit of age as the sweetness is usually cut down dramatically with a bit of time. This delivers all the goods that a spiced, dark ale of this nature should have - dried, dark fruitiness, some spices, minimal sweetness, and little bit of that unique, wild Belgian yeasty character. This isn't even from Belgium and it's more enjoyable than half of the basic dark ales that come from there. I don't usually drink beers like this anymore but this is a very welcome addition to my cellar from time to time."
""
""
""
"Enjoy!"
"Notes: Perhaps the most authentic Belgian, not brewed in Belgium that I have had."
""
""
""
"This is certainly a very well made beer. Very complex with a feel that really supports the flavor. Worth trying and I'm curious to see what a bit of age does to this one."

"Final Grade: 4.55, an excellent A. This is the first time I've had the opportunity to try Trois Pistoles side-by-side with Maudite for comparison purposes. While I love Maudite, I think this one has a slight edge overall - the malt profile is a bit bolder, and the nice range of fruity flavours is guaranteed to satisfy Belgian dark ale fans the world over. One of the best beers in its style, bar none - you'd be a fool not to give this one a shot or two."
""

""

"Pours a very dark brown and is almost black in color. Has a 2-finger tan head that left some good lacing when sipped. The aroma is of cocoa with some dark fruits and some roasted malt. The taste was even better than the aroma and is very complex actually. Has a light smokey finish which is nice. No harsh or bitter aftertaste and goes down too easy. With the high alcohol, after a few of these you will be buzzin' real good. LOL! A great brew overall."
""
""

"O: Yet another solid offering from Unibroue. On point for the style. It's a very good beer, what else is there to say?"
""
""
"Overall 4.5: Certainly the best Unibroue I have tasted so far. Refreshing, complex, smooth and dry. Flavor notes are nuanced and balanced rather than IN YOUR FACE. I have had many Belgian ""Strong Dark Ales"" and this is the best so far. Hint: do not drink it at fridge temp. Let it sit out for an hour at room temperature and then drink it. So many more of the dried fruit flavors come out when you do this; at least this is my experience. Recommended."

"O - The 'horse with devil wings' part of the bottle art is disturbing but everything else about this is pleasurable and intense without being mixed up or overpowering. The flavors and aroma of this are bold and well put together. An intense beer experience. Outstanding."
""
""
"It is a Belgian Style Strong Ale that pours a dark opaque brown with aromas of Belgian yeast and dark fruits. This is a beer you have to allow to warm a bit for all of the complex flavors and aromas to completely reveal themselves. Once it warms its deep rich dark fruit and roasted malt flavors come through the Belgian yeast tones. The very smooth and mellow flavors mask the high alcohol content and make this an easily quaffable brew. The Trois Pistoles is a great example of the Unibroue quality and an excellent beer."

"At first look, I was not too impressed with this beer. Average looking pour, dark muddy brown with golden tinge, and a very light head that dissipates quickly. Smell goes a long way for me with beer, and this one didn't really draw my attention. Belgian yeast, some earth tones and hints of apple make for a decent, but lackluster nose. But man, does this taste truly wonderful! Lots of fruits up front, green apple, cherries, grapes followed by darker dates, brown sugar, and figs. Lots of Belgian yeast, and clearly has some Tripel influence. No booze whatsoever. Body is damn near perfectly fitting, perhaps could use a touch more carbonation. Overall, a wonderful drinker, but missing some of the other elements that can make a craft brew a truly all around great experience."

"O: A very good beer, great balance, depth, and badass artwork. Not quite up my alley as far as taste goes, but exceptional for its variety- it will stand up to the best Belgium has to offer."

"Overall: One of the best beers I've had, and a great beer to enjoy as the seasons change and the temperature drops and things get cold and damp. I would certainly buy this again."

"o: Unusual, not nearly as pleasant as La Fin du Monde. Frankly disappointing, because I love the story related to the label and the name, and as #237 on the BA top 250 list I was expecting something exceptionally good. This is obviously a quality made brew, but the taste is not something I would likely seek out again."
"Poured from 750 ml corked bottle at cellar temperature. Unique murky brown color, like dark chocolate syrup mixed with root beer and some tan froth. Aroma is a deep rich blast of dark fruits, cherries, strong Unibroue yeast, dark sugar, herbs, spice. Palate is also deep and dark, dates, raisins, dried cherries, brown spices, chocolate pudding, rum, molasses, and grassy hops. Sweeter and less spicy than Maudite. Finish is semi-dry with some hops like a Belgian dubbel; some sources consider this beer to be an example of this style. Some vanilla notes reveal themselves as the dark fruits recede. Some woody flavors recall a barrel-aged spirit but not overpowering. Stands with Maudite as one of the world's finest."

"Poured out of a bottle. Had a date on it - didn't care to look. This poured a deep dark caramely brown color. Little head and little lacing. The smell was a very pronounced fruity aroma - very strong. Smelled like raisins. The taste was great - the caramel and dark fruits seem to work well together on the palate - this is even better than Fin Du Monde. This is a smooth well balanced beer. A very strong Belgian Dark. Great stuff"

"Golly. I was floored by the price then floored by the taste. I won't go into articulating all the freekin' raisins, chocolate, and pears while others can broil up that bafflegab better than I can. Alls I no is that it was delicious, beautiful looking with a commendably stellar head of foam, and remarkably easy to quaff into the second giddy round. I'm going to look into making something like this for my private stash for sure. If anyone's got a 5-gallon recipe that they've tried and would happily share, I would be eternally grateful."

"12oz foiled, screw-cap bottle served unapologetically in pint glass. Best before 10-26-15. Beer is dark brown with hints of red and forms a massive head, with giant soda bubbles. Yeasty, fresh aroma. Flavor combines bright Belgian ale malt flavors with rich date, sour cherry, and plum fruit flavors. Spicy up front (cinnamon, clove). Raisiny dark fruit really comes through in the aftertaste. A healthy dose of carbonation keeps the beer refreshing and prevents the beer from getting heavy on the palate. Extremely drinkable."
""

""
""
""
""

"The Verdict: Delicious. If you're looking for a Belgian dark strong ale, this is a good place to start. Smoooth, complex, and balanced. It's on the sweet side of bittersweet, but only by a few inches. Good stuff."

"Pours a deep dark brown with a flourishing head of beige foam that recedes to a very thin cap. Soapy lacing and alcohol legs. On the nose it’s cherries, bready yeast, strong malt undertones, sticky fruit and some horse blanket. The hops are forward on the palate with a little pepper accompanied by the yeasty sweetness and the ripe fruits. The malt is good and strong like a dark beer should be but the balance is perfection. It has a medium-heavy body but it’s practically weightless on the palate and finishes off-dry with some alcohol warming. This ale has dash and a soaring spirit. One of the best."

"Overall nice, a long time favorite for me, nice dark malts and fruit flavors as well as sweet flavors and the Belgian characters, even the light spices were nice. the booze gets a little too strong overall and might be the only downfall."

"Overall: This is a fantastic example of the Belgian strong dark ale style. For the most part, it is very classic, but the shift toward drinkability greatly benefits the beer overall. Based on this and La Fin du Monde alone, Unibroue is most deserving of its sterling reputation. This beer is up there, though not better than, the great examples of the style, and it is certainly cheaper. If you, like me, have been waiting to pull the trigger on this or other Unibroue beers, wait no longer: you are missing out. 17.5/20"

"O-Along with La Fin du Monde, Trois Pistoles was one of my early craft beer experiences, so it is nice to get around to reviewing it. This is a big strong beer with lots of flavor and great mouthfeel. However, with lots of other big strong beers to compete against now, it may lack the complexity that the best examples of this style possess. That being said, I would happily drink this as dessert six days out of seven because the sweetness really is delicious and the 355 ml bottle is easier to justify on a work night."

""

"D -So many north American ""Belgian style ales"" are cheap jokes of imitations that couldn't find Belgium on a map but this one could easily pass a blind taste test."

""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a black color. 5/4 inch head of an off-white color. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of sweet malt, pale malt, yeast, slight hop, spices, and an earthy grass aroma. Fits the style of a Belgian Strong Dark Ale. Mouth feel is smooth and clean, with a low carbonation level. Tastes of sweet malt, slight alcohol, slight pale malt, slight hop, slight yeast, hint of wheat, spices, and a hint of dark citrus. Overall, good appearance, aroma, body, and blend."

"O - Belgian-ish cola and spices. Pretty boring actually."

""

" Far more estery than I recall. Could be the age. Would prefer more dark fruit prudence and more malt character."
""
"Genuinely delicious beer. I am kind of at a loss of words for how to describe it. It is not super bitter, nor is it super sweet. It is warming and refreshing at once. Super good. I tried a couple of their beers before and wasn't really convinced about how good a lot of folks think they are. I am definitely starting to come around."

"This pours a medium brown color with a foamy, beige head. The aroma is slightly yeasty and malty with some dried fruit. The taste is very rich and bold with lots of complex flavors. There is mostly dried fruit and spices that finishes with a lingering yeast after taste. Gives off a good little alcohol warmth as well. Very well made!"

"O: I'm not afraid to say I have a soft spot for unibroue, and this beer is one of the reasons. It may have been the first craft type beer I had. The yeast profile and dark fruityness made me say ""wait what? There's more beers that taste like this"" and from there I was gone. Trois Pistoles is a fine example of a BSDA done right in North America."

"Maybe I was being a little too critical because I had such high hopes for this beer after many recommendations from friends and such high ratings on this sight. Don't get me wrong, this beer is damn good, balanced excellently, and certainly unique. But it doesn't quite hit ""blow-me-away"" status. Something I definitely wouldn't turn down if offered, and certainly not bad at only 8$ for a bomber."

""

""
""
""

"A great Ale. I've been drinking Trois Pistoles for a while. A great price considering the quality. Whenever I drink this, I taste a lot of fruity notes.

"Pours a thick, dark ruby-burgundy with light foam. Wonderful bouquet with stone fruits dominating. The flavor shares an equal profile, with some plum and fig as well as a date-like sweetness standing out. What I find remarkable is how smooth (and smoothly sweet) this is. I mean, almost velvety. While not unusual I forget. (Belgian Strong Ale is not as clearly defined a category in my mind as say a dubble or triple and the wide variation is part of the reason.) This one won over some new converts recently and I can’t wait to share some more soon."
""
""
"O - I love the feel of this beer from start to finish. The flavors are very crisp and refreshing, and surprisingly well-balanced given the alcohol level of the beer. The bubbly carbonation makes this beer stand out from other Belgians I have tried, and I really enjoyed it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"From a 750 mL bottle this poured a dark brown. The smell was of citrus and fresh fruit. Carbonation was sharp like Champagne. The taste was oak-y and nutty with hints of freshness and citrus that the smell suggested. While still being a strong dark ale, this feels lighter than and crisper than others."

"Poured this 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. This Belgian Strong Dark ale poured an amber to brownish color, produced a average tannish head, decent retention and left an average amount of lacing on the glass. The aroma of this ale consisted of malted grain and grassy hops. Medium in body, this Ale has a foundation of toasted malt, spicy pepper, and dark chocolate. The finish contains grassy hops and is somewhat dry-. Great Winter Warmer/Session beer. Wonderful Belgian Style Ale- This is a must try."

"Pours a ruddy brown with hazy garnet highlights and a thin off white head that quickly dissipates to a ring on top. Brown sugar, light fruit and lots of yeasty esters make up the bulk of the aroma. The flavor is yeasty and bready with a lot of burnt and brown sugar. Light non descript fruity flavors and a touch of alcohol round out this out quite nicely. Medium body with a spirited level of carbonation and a sweet bubbly mouthfeel. I really liked this beer. I know its appropriate for the style, but the carbonation in this and most Belgians for me ruins the mouthfeel."

"Wow, this is interesting. Had this one to celebrate new years seeing as how i didn't have champagne i figured a craft beer from a pressured bottle would be better anyway. Pours a dark mahogany with a bit of cloud. Looks very fizzy. Thin head. Smells strongly of citrus and another fruit, possibly cherry. The mouthfeel is the kicker. Very carbonated but delicate on the pallet. Perfect mouthfeel for the style. The taste is much like grapefruit and cherry with a slight anise/licorice finish. Very complex beer with a great mouthfeel. I will definitely drink this one again. Happy New Year indeed!"

"all unibroue beers are awesome, but this may be their finest offering. it pours a unique mahogany color, with a touch of something dark purple even in there. a nice white head stays around awhile, leaving lovely lacing down the glass. the nose of this beer is powerfully alcoholic, intemixed with a bouquet of fresh and dried fruits. plums, rasiins, candied pears, and figs come to mind, this is a rich nose. the yeast is also a classic belgian strain that really brings the smells together in a synergistic way. the flavor is equally complex and decadent, with the fruits taking center stage. its sort of sweet and thick like a port wine, but much brighter and lighter despite its full body and sticky texture. it finished boozy, and when it warms up its very intense, but this is a beer that opens up beautifully in the glass. it gets more and more yeasty to me, and less and less sweet. the mix of fruit and spice makes this a perfect winter warmer or holiday beer, although i dont think it is intended to be such. wonderful carbonation makes it more drinkable than it should be. this pairs well with red meat, boldly seasoned seafood, and caramely bread pudding. overall a world class example of the style."

"Deep dark ruby in color with three fingers of bubbly off white foam. Leaves a thin tan cap on top. Looks very lively. Smell of dark cherries, raisins, rum and sourdough. Bold flavors of fruits and a sort of cocoa taste. Slight sweetness. Full bodied and bubbly, alcohol warms you quickly but the alcohol taste is well hidden. Dry finish. Dynamite beer from one of my favorite styles."

"On tap at Kickbacks in Jax. Poured into a snifter. Very light beige head on a deep mahogany body. Oily, clear lacing. Aroma dominated by a Belgian yeast, candi sugar licorice and spices. The spices are maybe some clove and white pepper? Taste includes sweet caramel malts, some fig, some overripe banana, and again, some spice that is hard to describe. A taste unique to this beer. Another classic by Unibroue."

"I'm highly pleased with every aspect of this beer. From the first whiff to the last sip, it's quite an enjoyable experience. It's smooth and complex without being cloying. Recommendable."

"O-Nice delicate flavors that are rich and complex with a smooth moutfeel. I've this numerous times but just got around to reviewing it. Great beer"
""

"O- This is an outstanding belgian strong dark ale and makes me wonder why I have not revisited Unibroue aside from La Fin Du Monde in such a long time."
"O: A great beer all and all. Not too over the top on flavours yet they are all very present and balanced."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The taste starts almost fruity which lingers and a big yeast clove and spice enter and dry the mouth. Not my favorite style but true and as good as any from Belgium."
""
""
""
""
"O- A malty red wine. That's the easiest way to describe this. It's packed with dark fruits, balanced by creamy caramel malts. For 9% abv, the alcohol is very tame and only makes a slight appearance at the end. I'm slowly starting to realize how much i like this style. This is a great example."

"	Overall Impression: it gets much better as it warms up, the flavors come out more and the carbonation isn't as aggressive as it when it was colder; it is a nice fall beer, a little hearty and sure to warm you up some; it's got some layers of flavor in it that I cannot quite identify and had some trouble describing-a complex sipper (which seems to be something that Unibroue is known for); I think my favorite taste is the end, as all the flavors kind of come back together one last time as you swallow, but I think it smells even better than it tastes"

"O - OMG, what a beer, so so good... I had it on tap and what a delight... Wish I would have ordered a second one! It was so so good!!!"

"An enjoyable beer, the ABV is quite well hidden, even with the subtle, yet complex flavor profile."
"Overall. A very well made beer. The flavours are balanced nicely with enough compexity to be interesting, but still easy drinking."

"Trois Pistoles is one of the most interesting beers I have ever had the pleasure of tasting. The flavoring is absolutely massive in itself. There are big hits of chocolate and smokey coffee, but they are complimented by a big hit of cherry and grape. It is a dessert beer that stands as a meal in itself. There is a ton of alcohol however, which shapes the beer very differently than anything I have ever had. The alcohol pairs hand in and with the deeper fruit notes creating a sweet wine finish. Trois Pistoles tasted like a fine port mixed with a delicious quad, I have not had much like it."
"Overall - For a Strong Ale, it's different and unlike any I've tried before, which is good or bad depending on who you are. As a beer, it's a nice enjoyable ale that you should check out."
""
"Outstanding, highly accessible brew."
""
""
""
""

"Bottled. Dark reddish brown colour with a nice creamy off-white head. Malts, dry dark fruits, slight yeast and caramel in the aroma. The flavour is very full, dry dark fruits, caramel malts, vanilla, slight roasted twist along with berries and yeast. Also some spices in it."

"O - This one used to be one of my favorites. I haven't had it in a while and didn't review it. Having it again, it seems very roast-forward. Not sure if it's just this batch or if my tastes have changed, but the roast is a bit too dominant for me."
"Overall: While described as an ""Abbey Style Strong Dark Ale," it was not as strong tasting as expected. The lower alcohol warmth - especially for a 9% ABV ale - surprised me, as did the substantial fruit tastes. At times, the taste was a bit like a fortified digestif wine (say, a port or very fruity brandy) without the syrupy wine texture, but never lost it's beeriness; it also didn't have the nose-confusing, overwhelming alcohol delivery of a digestif. While not a fan of sweet beers, this is a nice blend of fruits and dark abbey ale which balances the best of both. Perhaps an all-time favorite for blending so many distinct flavors and characteristics in such a balanced way. In the end, I'd give it a 4.75 (I've yet to find a 5), but that's not an option here."
""
""
""
""
""
"T: A rich, almost bready mouthfeel with lots of Unibroue yeast, chocolate covered black cherries, raisin and some malty sweetness. Really good stuff."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This is a great example of this style of beer, very well made and easy to get. I am glad to have access to most of the Unibroue line."
"O: A super fruity BSDA. Most BSDAs are fruity to begin with, but this one is loaded with a variety of strong and sweet fruit flavors. Very complex, very nice balance and very tasty. Surprisingly mellow and easy drinking."
""
""
""
""
""
"The taste is scary good. The carbonation is very prickly, much more than I expected after the flat look. Plums, prunes, and molasses come to mind. The slight hint of booze is like a sweet dark rum, but in a good way. Its sweet from the molasses and brown sugar flavors. Not a ton of malt flavors shine through, but this is an amazing dessert beer for cooler days."

"This is simply the finest beer I have ever had to pleasure to drink. It pours a beautiful dark maple syrup color with a nice 1 and 1/2 finger head. Lacing is minimal. The smell has some fruit, bread, grasses and maybe some other notes. Mouthfeel is delightful. A fullness of flavor with the perfect amount of carbonation. Taste is extremely well balanced. Sweet malt with some fruit notes (not overwhelming) and some toffee. The finish is smooth. Even with the high ABV, it is well hidden. It is near perfect in every way!!"
""
""

"O: Really nice and complex. Up there with the best Belgian darks available. Will definitely re-visit soon."
""
""
""
""
""

"Dark reddish-brown pour with a foamy off-white head that retains well and leaves a bit of lacing on the glass. Aroma of malts and sugars, fruitcake and spice. Lots of dark dried fruit in the taste, raisins, plums, figs, sugary malts, a dash of spice and hoppy bitterness with a slight alcohol bite. Medium body and decently smooth. Nice overall."
"Won't Make"
""
""
""
"Nose of plums, caramel, prunes, burnt sugar, and some toffee. Taste is sweet, grapes, caramel, brown sugar, dark fruit and molasses. This is awesome, one of my favorite Unibroue beers, maybe my favorite. Good stuff. I feel like there's some ginger and cinnamon in there too."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Excellent job. This beer belongs even higher than the #7 or whatever spot it occupies on the Belgian Strong Dark Ale top 100 list. It rivals Chimay, but falls just a hair short of that. I was rooting through my beer fridge wanting something dark to sip on, and I found a doozy in this beer. Very well put together."
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel is light and airy and effervescent. Overall, this is a very good beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a very good beer. I prefer this one to Maudite, personally."
""
""
"Having not been particularly in love with some of the other beers from Unibroue which I've tried (particularly Maudite - just not for me), I found Trois Pistoles to be a rather delicious offering that has renewed my interest in the brewery. All of the great things I've heard about Unibroue make more sense now that I've tried this one. It's complex and remarkably tasty. The cherry notes are my particular favorite part. Alcohol is nice and warming. Not a beer to take lightly, but a glass of Trois Pistoles every now and then is quite worthwhile."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Unibroue was one of the first brewers of interest when I got into craft beer, so I have a soft spot for them, but this is also a very fine dark Belgian-style ale worthy of appreciation."
""
""
"O:  Super spicy but delicately sweet. I recently reviewed Muadite and I'm having trouble picking my favorite. This delivers more raw spice and boozy flavors and not as much candy sweetness. The raw character creates a complex yet balanced brew. I will have to do a blind side by side tasting of these two. It's good to see that a brewery can create two ales of the same style and have both of them be great and so different. Well done! "

""
"Overall - Good, but really not all that dark. Certainly not as dark as the advert would have one believe. A lot more on the sweet and creamy side. As with all Unibroue beers I've had, the smooth creaminess is the star attraction of the show, much more so than the flavor itself."
""
""

"O-well-balanced flavorful dark ale, a pleasure to sip and savor"
"Pours a dark brown, huge head, great lacing. Smells of port, fruits, and cinammon. Taste very unique, similar to other Unibroue fare that I've had, quite carbonated. Somewhat sweet. Strong and complex fruit flavors, apple pear raisin. Balanced and dry. Another excellent beer from Unibroue."
""
""
""
""
""
"Yeasty, but very interesting. A lot of dark fruits, Belgian flavors, and other things going on. I had this a few years ago and enjoyed it. Thankfully, I still enjoy it."
"Overall: The best application of Unibroue house yeast. Incredibly sweet."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O. A very yummy beer that is very well made and i'll be adding it to my regular rotation of beers. For anyone that loves a nice strong ale that has not tried this yet please do, I am very glad a friend of mine recommended this to me."
""
""
"This is a warmer beer. One to be best had when you need a little inner warming. Definitely an enjoyable brew as many of the Unibroue beers are. Please try!"
""
""
""
"O- Rich and tasty, another winner from Unibroue. Easily beats many examples of this style that are priced at twice what I paid for this. It paired very well with some Pad Thai. The lime and tamarind balanced the malty sweetness nicely."
""
""
""
"Palate: full-bodied with fermented fruit the strongest flavor. Hits fairly quickly and tastes of raisin. Feels heavy in the mouth and finishes with a slightly choppy sensation."

"Vero Beach, Fl"

"A good dark Belgian ale that I could see myself buying regularly. Unibroue never disappoints."

"A quality dark ale. It was a bit lighter than I expected and it had been a good while since I've had it."

"Overall – A very nice tasting Belgian dark. A great flavor profile with a wonderful aroma and feel. A brew to try."
"Ovrall: A great beer. One is enough since its rather sweet and heavy on the tongue. Also a good one to end the night with considering the texture and flavor/smell. Im still astounded at how similar the smell and taste are. Another good Unibroue brew."
"Notes: Severed in a tulip glass."
"Overall this is an awesome brew that I can't believe I've passed over as many times as I have. I finally got a bottle because I looked at it and saw something in the stores description that it ""rivaled a fine port"" and I just happened to be in the mood for something. I'm definitely going to buy this again, and likely will age some too."

"Overall: another excellent beer from this brewery. One of the best in a genre with some big name and very well made beers in it."
""
"O: Fragrant, flavorful, smooth, awesome overall, but given the aging on this bottle, and the fact this a Unibroue product, I can't say I'm surprised"
""
""
""
""
"O- A bit more slick on the palate and rich in the flavor than Maudite, it is another homerun from Unibroue. I (only slightly) prefer the flavor profile of Maudite, but Trois Pistoles is an amazingly rich and satisfying brew."
"O: A really delicious and complex Belgian dark ale that perfectly balances sweetness, spiciness, bitterness and booze."
""
""
""
"Poured into pint glass. Rich darkish color beer. This beer and small to medium head and tasted like malts, chocolate and carmel. Very smooth beer going down. Was intrigued by the bottle at first thinking it might be wine, but an excellent dinner beer"
"I enjoy it's smooth approach, sweet and tantalizing with a bit of a dry wit and smooth talk that hints at it's darker boozier side. Everyone left the table satisfied."
"It's a beauty, eh. A Canadian beer with a great, complex flavor without being too heavy. We split a big bottle between four of us. One guy noted a citrus flavor, I thought of walnuts. There's alot going on here. 9% abv, but you wouldn't know it, because the of the wonderful flavors, the high alcohol content is hardly noticable. It is highly recommended."
""
"O: Very good"
""
""
""

"O: Pretty good brew. Not a beer you want to take huge gulps of but something for sipping for sure. I would drink it again."

"Simply in love with this ""Broue"" from Unibroue."

"This is very easy to find in New Jersey. Just because it is always there, don't pass it by."

"Overall, an excellent beer that fans of abbey-style ales should be sure to try. It's not the most drinkable beer, nor is it the best tasting, but the flavor is so complex and unique that it demands respect. I can't wait to try it again."
""
""
""

"Overall a pretty good beer, has all the Belgian characteristics you would expect."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Truly unique, even for the broad category that it belongs to. The red/port wine flavor, lack of yeast, and unique alcohol flavor make this one different. Like most Belgian ales, best served around 50-55 degrees F."
""
"I couldn't tell. I'd like to age one of these for about 3 years to see what would happen. Overall I liked it but didn't looove it, but I would say it is solid representation of the style."
""
"O: I'm mostly impressed with this one, big wow, will come back to this again"
""
"This stuff is kind of an acquired taste, but it's so interesting and complex it's worth trying. The four-pack of 12 oz bottles is great for getting people to taste and compare a few of their beers."
""
""
""
"Main scoring for the fresh bottle; 2009: 4/4/5/4.5/4.5 reflecting the mellow aged flavor and higher creaminess developed over the aging."
""
""
"An amazing, world class ale at a great price. Pairs well with salty and fried foods, red pasta sauce, sharp cheeses and wheat-based crackers."
""
""
""
"O: Quite tasty, an excellent and full-flavored example of the style. Definitely worth trying, and trying again."
""
""
"If all Belgian Strong Dark Ales are comparable to this one, I really have to look further into this style. This is a beer that is quite close to being perfect. Definitely one of my new favorites."
""
""
""
"Great beer! Complex and delicious!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Such an easy drinker. Wow. The drinkability is insane on this. The subtle complexity of this beer makes it so good."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Despite the lackluster head retention by any beers standards (let alone a Belgian Strong), and weak nose, Trois Pistoles is an excellent beer. The mouthfeel is amazingly delicate despite having 9% ABV. Although this ale is a little less complex than I was hoping for (perhaps my expectations are too high), it is nonetheless delicious and highly drinkable. Will definitely purchase again at world market."
""
""

""
"Overall: A-/B+"
""
"- I've 3 other bottles of this in my possession and will hold onto them for a while to see what changes. (With my memory being the only enemy between now and then.)"

"O: Trois Pistoles starts strong, hooking you with the savory power of its rich malt profile and mouthfeel. After a while, though, the novelty starts to wear off and it’s not as satisfying (though it’s a good drink the whole time). Another Unibroue win."

"O- pretty damn good beer, lots of flavour and complexity. delicious. pity there no longer being exported to australia."

"A dark pour with minimal head for a Belgian, and no real outstanding smells (except a slight hint of Belgian yeast). However, the taste is amazing. Fruity and some nut flavors come out in a flavor bouquet. Very complex beer that maintains its flavors in the mouth for a good duration. It has that perfect Belgian bite. An overall masterpiece of flavor."

"O: Overall a very enjoyable beer. The flavors blend well. Not a very overpowering beer, but again very enjoyable."
""
""
""
"O: Really good, I enjoy Belgian Dark Ales more than almost any other Belgian style. The depth of character, fruitiness keeps the maltiness in check."
""
""
"Overall: I love everything about this beer from the initial pour to the very last sip. I would be remiss if I didn’t mention how cool looking the label was too. A ""session beer"" this is not. If you’re looking to try something different and enjoy the dark Belgian style and want lots of flavor, then this is a “must try”. I will definitely buy this again. Heck, this is so good I’m going to commit to a 1/6th keg for the dual-tap kegerator @ my basement bar. Unibroue makes some tasty beers. I haven’t been disappointed yet...Outstanding in every way!!!"

"O - I enjoyed this one. Lots of flavor and an awesome feel make this one fairly easy to drink. If the booze would die down a bit this one would be really good."
"It has been a year or so since I last had this beer, and it really holds up to the pressures of a developing palate."

"Overall, I hated it. And at $8 a bottle, I hated it even more. It might be great for some, but it is by far one of my least favorite beers. If I were at a party and there were only two beers (trois pistoles and PBR), I'd take the PBR."

"Pretty good flavors. Crisp and refreshing. Could be had by itself, with food, isn't heavy at all."
""
""
"O - This a complex, but well balanced & drinkable beer. The alcohol is very deceiving in the beer, would never know it was 9%. This is an outstanding beer & a must have for all beer enthusiast!"
"Overall--This was my first encounter with Unibroue's stuff, and I'm hooked. It deviates from the traditional Belgian style just enough to grab your attention, but without coming off as a genre-bending Frankenbeer. This is one of those beers that you can instantly identify as having received detailed attention from the brewer. I would classify it more as a dessert beer to be enjoyed exclusively by itself, but I'm sure it would pair well with a meal due to the complexity of flavors."
"It poured nicely, but had a bit horse of horse blanket on top of dates and roasted malt. Taste was also a bit dank for me, but the mouthfeel was crisp and pleasant, which makes this more drinkable. It is a bit on the sweet end for me, and would not make a good session beer. A decent strong ale for the 410 four pack price, but I would not go out of my way to pick this up."

"D - A sweet, dark, and fruity BSDA with a fair amount of complexities in the flavor profile. A tasty mixture of dark malt, dark fruits, and yeasty goodness makes this a deceptively easy beer to drink. Despite the big flavor and high ABV this ale is remarkably easy to drink. Overall, this is probably a touch above Maudite."

"750 ml bottle into globe glass, best by 11/18/2013. Pours clear dark reddish brown color with a fairly dense 2 finger khaki head with good retention that reduces to a nice lacing cap that lasts. Some spotty lacing on the glass as well. Aromas of big raisin, molasses, fig, chocolate, caramel, tart cherry, and spicy yeast. Very nice aromas with good strength and complexity. Taste of big raisin, chocolate, fig, prune, molasses, caramel, tart roasted grain, and yeast spiciness. Lingering notes of raisin, prune, chocolate, caramel, molasses, and spicy yeast on the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a fairly creamy, smooth, and lightly prickly mouthfeel. Alcohol presence is basically non-existent for being 9%; with only a slight warming on the finish. Overall this is an outstanding and highly enjoyable Belgian strong dark ale. Tons of fruitiness and complexity; with easy drinkability."

"O: I really enjoy Unibroue's offerings, but this one seemed a bit off. I wasn't a fan of the big medicinal and phenol attributes. With some cleaning up, this could be a great beer. As is though, it is just an average BSDA."

"Poured from a 22 oz bottle into a tulip, best before 5-26-14. This pours a nice dark brown color, almost black with a massive light tan head. The smell is of rich malts, lots of dark ripe fruits. Feel is medium to light with very high carbonation. The taste is of the same, lots of sweet dark fruit, a little alcohol taste is obvious, this would probably be better with a little age."

"Drink- I've had many a Unibroue beer and I can say I like their dark offerings better. The balance of malts, fruit, yeast and bitter is one of my favorites. I'll always come back to Unibroue."

"Tremendous beer."

"O - Only my second Unibroue beer and although I liked this less than La Fin du Monde, I still enjoyed sipping on it while sitting around with family. I might revisit this one again sometime."
""
""
""
"O: another great Ale from Unibroue. I could easily stick with Unibroue Ales if I had to choose a session beer. They're high in alcohol but extremely drinkable. This is a beautiful dark ale, unique flavor and easy to find in NYC. Definitely an 'A' in my book."
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"It's another enjoyable beer from Unibroue. Tastes a bit different than a lot of other Belgian strong dark ales, but it's a must try nonetheless."
"O: One of the better if not the best Belgian Strong Dark Ale I've had. Very complex and drinkable."

"Overall, a great beer, best enjoyed slow, while watching a movie or reading...or studying! Better without food"
"This was overall good, but I expected something great. I think this one smells better than it tastes, but is still a fine brew. Flavors were a bit on the weaker side, but they blended very well."
"Overall: I do not know if there was something wrong with my bottle or if this is just what it tastes like. I may have to buy another bottle to try and give this beer a chance, but this was by no means a good expierence for myself"

"Overall-A good beer. Could be a little beer for a belgian strong dark ale but good."

"Pours a rich, dark, deep brown with a nice head of off white. Lots of dark fruit on the nose and the taste follows suit- raisins, prunes, plums. Earthy notes follow also. Medium body with interestingly high carbonation released in tiny superfluous bubbles. A little distracting but true to style. Smooth as butter and overall a pretty solid brew. However, I don't know if I'll be purchasing much more of this as there are better examples at the same price point."

"O - an amazing example of a belgian dark strong ale."
"Overall: A very good beer, I believe Unibroue doesn't make anything but A class beers."
"Overall: This is something I would order again."
"O: I love this from the first sip. A very flavorful beer with good malty taste mixed with fruit. I like this a lot."
"Not bad. Trois Pistoles has more spice and citrus than I'm used to, and it’s a bit lacking in the complexity of established Belgians. But it’s different, at least."
"I cannot wait to explore others like it!!!"
"Overall, this is a nice representation of this style and keeps it very traditional and tasty."
"If I had the money I would buy this by the case!"
"One of my favorites from Unibroue, and an amazing value for the price!"
"In other words, try this if you have the chance. Skip over other Unibroue offerings and tap straight into their gold supply with Trois Pistoles."
"O - Complex and beautiful beer. Abv very well veiled by the cornucopia of Belgian flavours and aromas."
"Overall – very interesting and good taste. Fun to think about an analyze as well as to enjoy."
"Overall: Very good beer overall. I love most everything Unibroue puts out, and I'm a big fan of Trois Pistoles in bottles. On draft, it's still very good."
"Poured out as a deep brown color with a nice looking tan head on top. The lacing is pretty good here. The smell of dark malts and fruits blend with the Belgian yeast aromas creating a slighty sweet aroma on the nose. The taste of the beer is lightly roasted, the sweetness of the fermented fruit flavors come through and leaves a dry finish in the mouth. The mouthfeel of this brew is a little creamy and had some light carobnation making this brew an easy going sipper that can be enjoyed for a while. Overall I found this to get better as it warmed up, this is a really nice brew."
"The beer is a dark hazelnut hue, with a half inch of beige head that leaves a decent amount of lacing on the glass. The aroma brings malt, yeast, caramels, dark fruit. The flavor is fairly sweet, with dark fruits and yeast. Alcohol warmth emerge in the finish. Lingering notes of sweet, dark fruits soaked in alcohol. Medium bodied with moderately high carbonation. While not as delectable as the upper tier beers of this genre, Trois Pistoles is ubiquitous and enjoyable."
"On the flavor, it is a beer that I would recommend anyone try, beer lover or not, although for those who are not fond of alcohol's flavor and heat it may be prudent to chill the bottle a bit (JUST A BIT), before serving. As I just said alcohol does come through relatively quickly but not before the chocolate flavor and malt character shine through with wonderful balance. Banana esters and spice linger on the palate with a length and mouth feel, much like that of a good Bordeaux. The finish is extremely long and extremely well balanced with a nice alcohol warmth in the belly. Overall, if this beer is available try it, especially if the prices are comparable around the U.S. as my 750 ml bottle was just over $6.00 (which is a steal in my book). A beer as refreshing as returning to Beeradvocate to write a review!"
"This is a good beer from Unibroue. I hope to try more of this style. The large flaw in my mind is the dry finish, it doesn't work well for this style."
"Overall: One of my favorites from Unibroue. Definitely worth a try."
"Overall: Another style I would not reach for on a daily basis, but definitely a well crafted, great tasting beer. I'll give one away and cellar the other two!"
"O - in my opinion this is the best of the bunch from Unibroue with is big flavour, easy drinkability, and dangerously well masked high octane, a must for any beer advocate"
"Overall - Excellent Abbey Style Strong Dark Ale. Very good in all areas of what I look for in a brew. The rum scent was a nice touch that didn't distract from the rest of what this has to offer."
"O. A really good dark ale, I would like this beer on a cold winter night, sharing with friends, and family. Prosit."
"O - Overall I just don't love it the way I love most of their other beers. Not sure I can pick out why, but maybe the body doesn't quite match the flavor, and it tastes a bit... busy. I'll take a Terrible, thanks."
"This is a great belgian-style dark ale, and very reasonably priced in Canada. It's been a long while since I've had this, and now I remember why I liked it in the first place!"
"$8.99 (-$1.00 coupon) = $7.99 at Total Wine & More. Not bad, but not a do again."
"Medium bodied with excellent carbonation, this beer is very drinkable. The body coats your mouth well without becoming sticky. The carbonation fizzes away when held in your mouth but does not seem to detract from the taste."
"This is a strong dark ale which is refermented in the bottle. Trois Pistoles has a sweet taste as well as a pleasant aftertaste. You only catch a hint of chocolate, brown rum and spices. I ended up drinking this beer by the pool but I would not recommend it. It would be best enjoyed chilled in a glass and sipped on while perhaps smoking a cigar with your friends."
"not the best Unibroue i've had. i liked Maudite better. still, this is a dark ale well worth trying."
"as a lover of unibroue im surprised it took me this long to try it. looking to take a trip to enjoy this from tap"
"O: This is a nice belgian strong dark. I like everything I've had from unibroue so far, so I'm looking forward to trying more."
"I bought this on a whim the other day and I don't regret a second of it. Appearance was dark brownish red, with a one inch head leaving decent lacing. The smell was excellent, spicy and fruity, almost a raisin smell. Reminded me of a spiced wine. Taste was surprisingly fruity, with strong fig and prune flavors. Flavor turned a bit more spicy as the bottle warmed. Mouth feel was good, not as thick as I expected though. Overall I intend to buy another bottle and store it for bit, break it out for a special occassion."
"This is an outstanding beer!!!"
"A nice, affordable fruit forward Belgian-style dark ale with a niec yeast presence. Not something I would prefer to drink all the time, but it is nice to have once in awhile."
"This is complex and a bit of a challenge. Spend some time with Trois Pistoles and you'll appreciate it better. I usually like the dark Belgians, but this one just came out of left field with all the fruit flavors and complexities. I feel the spices really throw off the balance, but the taste that lingers always begs me to take another sip. Not sure what to make of it or how to compare it with other dark, high ABV Belgians I've tried. Guess I'll have to have another..."
"Overall Drinkability - Overall good beer. Refreshing if you're in the mood for a medium-bodied, refreshing beer."
"O: A very enjoyable beer. A little dry overall, but lots of good, complex flavors in here. Will definitely buy it again."
"Pours a dark brown, close to black w/ a mountainous 3 finger head, even w/ a careful pour. Decent carbonation and good lacing. Impossible to see through this beer. The nose has prune, fig, bread, and some other spice I can't quite place. Alcohol is in there as well. Not quite balanced or strong enough for the style. The taste is exactly the same as the nose. A little out of whack and weak taste for the style w/ a massive alcohol burn which shouldn't happen at 9%. Feel is very dry, sweet and on the thin side. Overall, this is a good beer, but far from world class in the style. This is a style loaded for bear w/ outstanding world class beers, and this falls short. Still, I would have this again if nothing better was in my beer fridge."
"Overall: A very solid dark Belgian ale. Good balance of dark fruit sweetness and yeasty spice."
"M - Clean very dry finish."
"D - An excellent complex beer. Very little alcohol comes through, making this very drinkable, which is impressive for 9% ABV. As the beer warms up, the flavors seem to open up and become more potent. Very impressive."
"O - Delicious. So many flavors going on. This is my second favorite Belgium Strong Dark Ale."
"O: As others have said, yet another winner from Unibroue. Very enjoyable."
"Pours a deep caramel brown color with a tall fluffy off white head. Brown sugar and mission figs on the nose, baking spice and a bit of green fruity note almost like green raisins. Medium plus body with a nice bit of sweetness that is not the least bit overpowering. Caramel and deep toasted malts on the palate with more of the green grapes adding a tartness that keeps the sweetness in check. A really nice creamy carbonation that ties everything together. This is a beer that if you were tasting it blind, you would think it was most certainly an actual Belgian beer, not a Canadian one."
"Overall pretty good, but not mind-blowing."
"D: an enjoyable bel dark from unibroue. the nose was a little more exciting than the palate but not completely overshadowing. good brew."
"O- A very nice beer, and something I would enjoy on a much colder day. (Reviewing in summertime!)"
"Overall- I feel like Unibroue can't make a bad beer. I definitely prefer Maudite over Trois Pistoles, but nonetheless a really good beer."
"It's another damn fine beer from Unibroue, one of the best beer brand values I've seen in the states, imported or not. This stuff isn't at all expensive, and I highly recommend you try stuff from these guys. Great job!"
"NOTE: Frankly, I'm shocked at the number of reviews that claim the alcohol is ""well hidden"". This brew is fairly boozy and very warming to the body. There's no hiding those facts. Let's just say that the alcohol flavor is not off-putting, but by no means is it hidden."
"O: This is one robust beer! This is huge in the spice & yeast department so if you don't like clove, coriander, cinnamon, peppercorn or funky yeast you won't like this. This might be a good beer to cellar to help mellow out and bring the dark fruit flavors forward. Still a very enjoyable beer with no sign of the 9% abv."
"This beer pours a nice dark brown color with a nice offwhite- tan colored head. the smell is sweet, spicey with hints of dark fruits. the taste follows the smell with dark fruit flavors and a nice spiceness from the yeast. the mouthfeel is medium boddied and very well carbed. overal a very good beer."
"Cheers!"
"O: Outstanding beer, one of the best I have had to date. Virtually no hint of the 9% ABV. Great choice for any occasion, even a quite evening."
"O - A good representation of the style with a fantastic flavor profile. A sipper that should be enjoyed slowly."
"slainte!"
"O: very nice brew, a bit too deep for my particular taste but by no means unappealing"
"DRINK (4/5) The lighter body makes this a bit more drinkable, though. I like the flavors so much, but they're a bit too dark for a good session. Really tasty, though!"
"O: Excellent beer that you can find just about anywhere, which makes me like this beer even more. This beer introduced me to the style and I haven't stopped loving it since."
"O- I need to run out and try to find some more old stock of this brew. Really nice mouthfeel, amazing nose! This brew should be enjoyed any time that you'd drink a nice Cab! Nice thick aged Porterhouse with cherry glaze for example... damn... now I'm hungry!!!"
"All in all, this is a solid brew. I haven't had too many offerings of Unibroue, but I've never been overly impressed. They do tend to make some authentic Belgian imitations, though, and this one is no exception."
"O: Maybe it was my glass, but this beer hint a faint soapiness to it that I didn't like. 3.5"
"O: This is pretty good, as expected since it is brewed by Unibroue. It is quite unique tasting and I will definitely buy it again, but it isn’t quite as good as its brother, La Fin Du Monde."
"Edit: I drank this from a 750 mL bottle and the last 250 ML or so is just magical. If only the whole beer was this smooth, thick, and tasty it would be an A+ and be better than Chimay Blue overall."
"It seems that everyone knows these guys for La Fin Du Monde, but there are plenty of better blonde tripels out there. This one is relatively unique."
"O: Overall, just an amazing beer. For the price, I dont know of a better Belgian style beer. Stimulates your tongue and tastebuds with its amazing mouthfeel and flavors. Highly recommended."
"Notes: Long time since I had a Trois Pistoles. It was one of those that I bumped into years ago when I was expanding my interest in craft brewing and for some reason or another it faded away from the radar. This try rediscovers a brew richer than what I had stored in memory, maybe it is not for the ages, but it is quite pleasing and solid all around."
"Pours a dark purple color reminiscent of a very dark red wine. pours with basically no head despite a decently aggressive pour. Lots of carbonation bubbles visible in the bottom of my Chimay goblet. Aroma is incredibly fruity, almost like juice and hardly reminiscent of beer. The taste is sweet and also fruity. Very good actually and not what I expected. It's light bodied and lively. Overall, this drinks very nicely. Reminds me a lot of what I liked about BSDA's when I first tried them and was introduced to what belgian beer can be all about. Classic taste. It's hard to tell how much age has improved this beer since it's been at least two years since I've had its mates and I did not take notes, but I can't imagine it hurt. i don't remember liking this one as much as I do now."
"O- I've been into Belgian's lately and this beer is only steering me further away from the stouts that I love. This will be my go to beer whenever I go to The Yardhouse."
"A very worthwhile, reasonably priced BDSA."
"Bottoms up people!"
"overall, another great brew from Unibroue. For the price, I dont know if I can find any belgian style ales. I think I prefer the Maudite over this one, but it changes every time I try it"
"O - I really do love this beer and I think I prefer it slightly to the Maudite (splitting hairs) - I would give it all fives but I am not going to make that call until I have had some of the highest rated beers to compare"
"A very well made beer. A little cleaner than Raison. After drinking this for a little while all I could taste was banana. A little annoyed that I picked up on that."
"D-Overall this was very good. might be alittle dry for some but overall this was very good. will get again"
"O: Sorry guys, I just can't get on board with this one."
"Quite delicious, and a standout, for sure."
"O - Not my absolute favorite BSDA, but the value and availability cannot be overlooked. I certainly will not hesitate to spend another lovely evening with one."
"Overall: A very good ale. One of my favorite beers. Decievingly alcoholic, I suddenly feel warm on my ears.. very easy to drink a whole large bottle in a sitting."
"Very crisp and drinkable for a 9%, which was also well hidden. Nice and tasty, but I'd prefer a fuller one. this one is above average, but nothing stellar."
"O: Probably my favorite Unibroue ale... which is saying a lot. Its an interesting, enjoyable beer. Very drinkable. Complex without being over the top. 9%??!! Hard to believe -"
"M - Slightly thin and watery, but with adequate carbonation. Has a sweet finish that leaves the mouth feeling sticky."
"O - overall, very nice. Not as good as a Rochefort or St. Bernardus but definitely delicious and can also be had for a very fair price considering the high quality."
"Poured into a tulip. Pours a pretty dark and bold brown with a white head that disappears in a hurry. The scent is strong of fruits and spices. It also gives you the hint that it'll have a strong alcohol flavor. The taste is of strong spiciness, alcohol and some fruity sweetness. A combination that was hot, boozy and just didn't work at all for me. The mouthfeel was medium with more carbonation than I expect from this style. I typically really enjoy BSDAs and Quads but this is not one that I would recommend to my friends."
"O - foreboding appearance (would look like a Coca-Cola in an opaque glass!) dampened my high expectations, but the exceptional aroma and flavor make this easy to recommend."
"O: Pretty good beer that can be purchased at a relatively low price. Tastes similar to red wine in some ways actually. Extremely drinkable."
"Back in the day, I was enticed to buy this beer by the lovely label and seemingly exotic cork-and-caged presentation. Now, I just remember it being damn tasty. It pours a dark burnt sienna topped by a nice finger of dirty off-white foam. The nose comprises clove, pumpernickel, black pepper, nutmeg, black cherry, cinnamon, candi sugar, and Belgian yeast. The taste brings in more of the same, along with some red apples, black grapes, raisins, figs, and rye bread. The body is an ephemerally light yet still pretty strong medium, with a very light moderate carbonation and a strangely crisp finish. Overall, a very nice BSDA, one I'll probably be returning to many times in the future."
"Overall: A spicy, tasty, carmelly, and enjoyable dark Belgian-style ale. Highly sessionable, but be careful. The 9% ABV is well concealed..."
"Felt warm and creamy then a cleanliness that was apprciated in the end. Not as good as Chimay (blue) Grande Reserve but a solid drinker."
"D - Goes down very smooth, leaves almost no alcohol burn. Great drinkability."
"O: As solid as this beer was, I'm not sure I can give it it's average for the"
"O: A pretty good beer, overall. Nicely attenuated, though the flavor doesn't quite live up to all the nose promises."
"Overall, another great beer by Unibroue. Rivals La Fin du Monde as my favorite from them. Affordable and delicious."
"O- very nice brew, another solid offering from Unibroue. This would make a nice close to the evening and could be well received by craft and non-craft drinker alike."
"D: Very nice. Possibly my favorite now that i know how close fin du monde is to it but with a better body."
"Overall a rich but not overpowering strong ale. A real nice balance between malty and lightness."
"I've waited almost a year for this, absolutely fantastic!"
"Overall this was a good Belgian Strong Dark Ale. I had Hell Hath No Fury yesterday and it was just about as good but this one was a lot more traditional and truer to it's style. Everything was pretty spot on for the style with the aroma being the highlight of this beer. This brew didn't disappoint and was about as good as I remember. I would for sure buy this beer again, its a nice beer to have on hand. If you like Belgian beer you will like this one. A good well rounded beer from Unibroue."
"This is one of my favourite beers of all time (so far haha). It's a sipping beer, layered and complex. And did I mention it's 9%? If you can find this beer, it's not one to miss."
"What the heck is it with Unibroue and these beers sometimes? They seem either really great or incredibly.. bad isn't the word.. it's more as if they are dysfunctional. This one... hard to put into words, but I know I wont be having it again (except maybe on tap if I don't have a choice). Still... doesn't stop me from trying their goods!"
"(750ml bottle at Sean's Unibroue tasting). Pours caramel color with a thin off-white head. Aroma of caramel and anise which is really nice. Taste is sweet like a tootsie rol. Medium bodied with an oily mouthfeel. I forgot how good this beer is. This is a really nice beer."
"I love this beer and it is in my top ten."
"O: A damn good beer from Unibroue. I could drink this until I passed out. It's a bit too high in ABV to session but it is most definitely pleasant to drink and the alcohol is hidden quite well."
"Overall- Haven’t had a beer yet from Unibroue that didn’t almost completely knock my socks off and this one is no different, a great smelling, great tasting dark ale that has all the qualities of a world renowned beer. If you’re a fan of darker ales and have this readily available, pick it up, you won’t be disappointed, and at the 9% ABV it goes down very smooth."
"Overall - Tasty, but nothing I'd order again (especially at $7.50 a glass...wow). Finished the glass easily without feeling as though I had drank a 9% alcohol beer."
"overall i aged this beer almost a year and it was def. worth it!"
"Excellent."
"Overall- A very nice ale! I wouldn't be able to drink all night, but enjoyed thoroughly. I would say the La Fin Du Monde is still more of a favorite for me but this one was also a hit for me. I like how all the ales from this Brewery are very complexed and are presented well. Will be having more!"
"Really enjoyed this brew, nice complexities and great balance."
"Really this beer is an A-? There are just so many better beers in this style....from all over the world even."
"Overall, I am extremely impressed with this beer on what is my first tasting. Unibroue rules and this beer is no exception. I see this as a winter beer , and look forward to having this with a rich meal in the colder months next year, (even though it is in the 30s in late March right now.)"
"Drinkability: It's a very smooth drinkable beer accompanied with great flavours and aromas. The complexity of this beer definitely hides some of the alcohol. It's an overall great, tasty, complex and distinctive Ale. Unibroue has impressed me once again."
"O: Overall this beer is quite enjoyable to drink. Love the variety of subtle flavors keeps me interested and wanting to try more. For a Strong Belgian Dark Ale this one is very easy and nice to drink."
"O: Overall I like this is a good Belgium Strong worth trying if you are a fan of the style."
"O: Good, just not quite the orgasm in a glass that everyone else seems to think about this beer. The slightly sour cherry flavor isn't a fave of mine. I enjoy La Fin Du Monde much better."
"o - a very good beer, love this style. i'm definitely planning on purchasing more of this in the future, possibly aging a couple of bottles as well."
"The beer is a very dark brown with mahogany on the edges of the glass. The head is off white and extremely lofty, it stuck around throughout the process. The beer smells of orange and grape and has a bit of sourness to it. First you taste fruits such as dates and plum, a smoothness washes over the tongue leaving a sweet, bready aftertaste. The beer is medium bodied with lots of soft carbonation, does not have a dry finish. This beer is a must dry, Unibroue has failed to disappoint so far."
"Excellent."
"Trois Pistoles is a deep brown color, almost black except for around the edges. Off-white head transitions nicely into a moderate head and patchy lacing. Smells of wet malts, some zesty citrus hops. Bitter yeast scents and dark fruits. Taste is spicy and alcoholic is hot. Some sweet plums and cherries but the bitter hops keep this under control. The hops are very zesty and herbal but the aftertaste is bitter.Mouthfeel could use to be a little smoother. The alcohol is very prevelent and this takes away from the drinkability. This is a belgian strong dark that represents the style very well although I did wish Trois Pistoles was a little more balanced."
"Drinkability: A definite sipper but the alcohol is well hidden. A pleasant drink. Will have again."
"D: a pretty delicious, though a little too sweet for my tastebuds, but it's definitely a legit BSA."
"Overall, this is very drinkable and very tasty for the style."
"A very good beer, I just wish I had a better way to describe it."
"Drinkability: Oh man is this a dangerous one. The alcohol is so well hidden I could see having two of these in no time and then realizing how much alcohol I've just had. I could drink this all on its own but in this case, I had it with a meal, which it went really well with - cinnamon + curry beef stew over couscous. I could easily have this again and again. Amazing beer."
"At no point is the 9% aggressive and the nice sweet balance of fruits and malts makes this a good compliment to a slightly spicy meal."
"The CPJ"
"D: For a 9% ABV beer, this was fantastic and one of my favorites from the renowned brewery."
"Mouthfeel is complex -- thin at first drinking with very high carbonation. Then you swish it round your mouth a bit and it foams up into a big, rich mouthfull of beer. A nice drinking beer -- both complex and highly drinkable."
"D=Excellent taste and lighter body make this downable"
"I don't know what it is, but if it says Unibroue on it I love it. Poured from the bottle into my Duvel tulip. Dark brown color with an awesome head. Smell was bready with just a touch of hops. Taste was similar to other Unibroue's which must be why I like it so much. Mouthfeel was medium-heavy and drinkability was easy for such a strong brew. Nice stuff."
"The alcohol? It's present - but not enough to be remarkable in any way to this reviewer."
"D - It's a good beer, very drinkable, but it just seems like there's not enough there to make me wanna have another one."
"The taste was very clean, no hops, just a good mouthful, a bit malty (or perhaps yeasty) What I found really great about this Ale, was the LOOONNNNG aftertaste. The taste lingered on and on, and it was something that you almost didnt need to take a second sip, since the first was was taking care of everything"
"Not 100% to my taste when I'm looking for beer, but I can certainly enjoy it. I see it as a solid Belgian style beer that lots of people who may not normally like beer could enjoy."
"I will continue to sample this one. Cheers."
"Overall, this was my first Unibroue beer and I was a bit disappointed. This beer just wasn't anything I look for in a Belgian Dark Strong. Maybe it was because it was on tap, but I've had BDSAs on tap before and loved them. Perhaps I'll give a bottle of this a try after I give some of Unibroue's other beers a chance, just going on Unibroue's reputation. Cheers!"
"Poured from a bottle into a tulip glass, the beer is an extremely dark, almost opaque amber-brown coloring with a bubbly, biege, airy head. On the nose, you get a whiff of the carbonation from the yeast in the bottle, as well as lots of dark fruit sweetness (plums and dates), and a little booze. The beer leaves a great lace along the glass as you move it around and drink. The beer is heavy, but crisp at the same time. Malty sweet flavors, with slight hints of spice to balance. Tastes like coriander, mostly, but it's too subtle for me to be sure. The fruit sweetness is a highlight along the molasses characteristics of the malt. Very heavy and robust flavors, but the light body does well to balance all of this. The aftertaste is extremely mild, with the slightest hint of spice and malt, but only a whisper. Clean, neat finish makes this one an easy drinker."
"Kind of ironic that this is probably my least favorite beer from Unibroue so far, yet I have the Trois Pistoles goblet."
"D: Good with seafood or a steak meal, or just a few by its's self."
"drinkability; Tasyy but the aftertaste and alcohol make it a little much to drink in quantity."
"D- I've never dared to drink more than one in a sitting, but the goodness of this beer makes it a highly pleasurable experience. One of my favorites in the style."
" An excellent example of a Belgium dark ale, Unibrou knows how to make a Belgium-style beer!"
"D - This beer is a great drink and another quality brew from Unibroue; nice strain of yeast in this beer"
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: Medium to full bodied feel, carbonation is good. Another winner from the Unibroue line, this is a nice go to beer and is certainly worth the endeavor. Good stuff."
"D: This is very port like in flavors and sweetness and is very fruity for its style."
"drinks well. nothing spectacular, failing to separate itself from the trademark unibroue yeast profile, but tasty and enjoyable nonetheless."
"D: Strong at first but smoothes out and builds in flavor. Very strong beer, hard not to want another."
"D. Far too easy...it doesn't hold you down...on tap I'd be in trouble!"
"D-lacking no negative qualities, the is one of the more drinkable strong belgian dark ales that i've tasted. it has a lot of good flavor in a nice light body. in fact, this is almost dangerously drinkable for the ABV, i know i could get the 4 pack of this beer and drink it all in a night and then possibly regret it the next morning."
"Poured from 12 oz bottle into a chalice glass. Pours a deep black with a half finger creamy light brown head. Nose is like most other Unibroue offerings -- heavy on the plum/raisin with a slight spice and yeast. This one was a little sweeter though, almost as though the fruit were slightly sweetened or barely dessicated. Very smooth and velvety in the mouth with a light carbonation that enhanced the sweetness of the fruit and allowed some spice to develop after. Alcohol was very well hidden again."
"Pours a very nice deep brown (pretty much black) with a bit of decent head and some decent lacing. Nice deep malty scent, with a slight spiciness in the nose. Excellent deep malty flavor, with excellent hints of roastiness, tastes of fig and plum, and a nice spicy yeast/hop finish. Goes down a bit rough, alcohol heat is noticable, but not bad."
"M, D- Medium bodied. The aroma and flavors tempt drinking. ABV imperceptible."
"Drinkability -- Overall, pretty good. Great aroma, balanced and subtle. A solid drinker that is readily available and at a reasonable price. If only this tasted as good as it smelled..."
"Drinkability was what really got to me on this, though. The high levels of not very mellowed alcohol and sugars (and active yeast?) made me a bit queasy halfway through, and, despite having a rye ale halfway through for something cleaner, I never quite finished the glass."
"Very drinkable indeed."
"D - Definitely a sipper and very enjoyable."
"drinkability - flavorful and complex, would appreciate a bit more body and lower carbonation"
"An excellent choice, will definitely drink again."
"Poured from 12oz bottle to a Duvel tulip glass. This beer pours dark very dark with a thin white head and white bubbles shooting to the top. Almost has the appearance of a dark cola or root beer, and has a nice crackling fizz . The smell on the nose is absolutely amazing, almost like fresh figs and berries chopped and sitting above your upper lip. Very rich,fruity and malty. Very strong spicy sweet, fruity taste with a nice presence of alcohol. This beer is extremely drinkable, delicious."
"D: it was tasty drinking great and is probably my favorite offering from unibroue."
"D: This is very drinkable. It's subtle and very pleasant to drink. It's really that simple."
"Poured all head and took a long time to settle down. Very dark clear brown, kind of a VanDyke brown. Smell has yeast, a hint of smoke in my opinion, and dried fruits. Taste again is dried fruits with raisin and fig. Moderately rich body. To me this reminded me alot of DFH Raison D'Etre except that one's richer and cheaper."
"Full in body and a little heavier than I would prefer but enjoyable nonetheless. This is most certainly a sipping beer and I'm fine with that."
"Feel nice on palate, with the consistency of the beer (average/thick) allowing it to sit on your tongue and bring about a new flavor every couple of moments. Very drinkable beer, and a great offering from Unibroue overall."
"D: This brew is divine and I continue to love this brewery. The alcohol is well hidden, often I split one of these with my father (he is NOT a beer drinker, but he agrees that this is amazing). This is mandatory pleasure for your palate."
"Overall: Kind of a hybrid drink. 1 beer + 1 wine = 3 Pistoles."
"Pours very dark. Almost has the color of dark blood. Has a great fruity and slightly sour aroma of figs or raisens, possibly some peach. You can also get a very slight scent of alcohol. To be honest i kind of find the smell a bit overwhelming. So many smells and its kind of hard to pick out the individual hints of each. Tastes just as it smells. Alcohol does not hide itself from you and is very present from the beginning. After taste is fine as well. Easy to drink but wouldnt drink all the time. Really have to be in the mood to enjoy this beer."
"This is an excellent belgian dark. easier drinking than I expected, especially at 9%. No overwhelming alcohol tones, and I reviewed this on a clean palette."
"D: A lovely brew and the best of the style I've tried yet. Unibroue has an army of winners and this is amongst it's best, those French Canadians really know their Belgian brews. A must try, seek this one out."
"A bit thinner than Maudite, both in flavor and consistancy, but nevertheless, this is another fantastic offering from one of Quebec's finest breweries. Perhaps the most drinkable Belgian Strong you're ever going to encounter. While not as rich and hearty as others of the style, Trois Pistoles more than makes up for this in terms of sheer drinking pleasure."
"Mouthfeel is medium with a high level of carbonation in this pour. Fairly drinkable for the high abv. Dry finish like a good wine. Highly recommend this one."
"I finally got around to reviewing this, 12 ounce bottle into a SA perfect pint glass. The pour is deep and dark, light fizzy white head, a bit of lacing. Lots of plums and sweet dark fruit on the nose. Taste like it smells, dark fruit, plums, dates, finishes with lingering sweetness. The body is medium, light carbonation. A good beer, would be better with a bit more body."
"Bottle poured into a Ommegang chalice. Dark brown color, light brown head. Smell is mostly yeasty, slightly sweet with some hints of grapes and plums. Taste is a nice blend of dark fruits, grapes, and plums... slightly sweet. Mouthfeel is surprisingly creamy. Drinkability is excellent for 9% ABV."
"O: Just a great Canadian interpretation of a Belgian Strong Dark Ale. Definitely in the top tier of BSDAs. A great compliment to Flemish Beef Stew. Trois Pistoles should be savored over about an hour, perhaps enjoying the Jayhawks pound some poor team."
"Alcohol is a bit too obvious, but doesn't detract, with any patience I will buy more and put away for a year. Another great from Unibroue."
"D - This beer is drinkable and tastes good. High alcohol comes through a bit but I definitely felt it after a while."
"The beer pours a dark brown color with some nice red highlights and a huge tan head. The aroma is Belgian yeast, sugar, cherries, plums, alcohol and maybe a little bit of anise. The flavor is Belgian yeast and cherries, along with some candy sugar, raisins and some darker, but not roasted, malts. There is a little bit of spicyness in the flavor as well as some alcohol that is very warming. Very drinkable. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. A classic Belgian-style ale that I could drink everyday."
"A bit fruitier and a bit lighter than I anticipated, this beer is still a pretty good find."
"D - Not something I am to interested in trying again."
"This is my third Unibroue and I would place it the same, behind La Fin du Monde and Maudite. Definately enjoyable, however."
"Overall: Overall, the beer was exceptional. I would highly recommend this beer to any beer drinker, you will not be disapointed."
"Drinkability- Astoundingly drinkable for a beer of 9% abv. I would not hesitate to purchase and drink more of this."
"D - A very sophisticated and worldly sipper of a Belgian Strong Dark Ale... Not bursting with aroma or flavor, but its there and it is very well executed... A very nice offering from Unibroue..."
"Serving type: bottle"
"Good drinkability. A couple would be great. Another solid Unibroue beer...definitely my favorite."
"I liked this quite a bit. My only real complaint would be, ""not as good as La Fin Du Monde""! I prefer the golden cloudy yeastiness of La Fin. This is much darker, but not thicker or more filling. A very nice beer. I would definitely get this again as part of a mixed six, and I'd like to try it on tap if ever I see it."
"Price = $7.99 at Witherspoon Wines"
"Post tasting note: I am a fan of Unibroue and Maudite is their #1 for me but this is a very close second. I was afraid that this would have excess belgian candi sugar flavor or too much of something else but these two beers from Unibroue continue to impress."
"Overall, while this may be harsh, I've had much better for the style, and this time around, I was not impressed. Will update this review the next time I have a bottle for a fair review/comparison."
"Overall, what we liked best about this brew was the heavy esters and clovey phenols that are predominate in both the aroma and taste. It is highly complex with nice fruity inclusions, and is ultimately a great brew from a fantastic brewery."
"I wouldn't buy this one again, but judging the beer for what it is, the mark is pretty dead on for a Belgian Strong Dark. I wish there was something else giving this a bit more depth than is displayed."
"Trois Pistoles was dark brown with a beige head. The head was rather small and didn't last with very little lacing. The smell was dark malt and some dried fruit. The taste was full of dark malt and fruit flavors with a touch of peppery spice. It finished dry and throat warming. It was medium bodied with fine carbonation. Drinkability was good. This is a tasty brew and well worth trying."
"Complex enough character once the ale eventually warmed, but too many strikes against it to fully embrace this offering."
"D - The carbonation makes it feel simpler than it is. There is a lot going on in this beer."
"D: Sweetness makes this a slow drink for me, one bomber is my limit here."
"This is a solid beer with a great smell but the taste does not match up to it."
"D: This is a very good beer, but is not a bargain next to the real (Belgian) thing. I cannot see spending the same money for a lesser beer."
"D - I could rock this stuff as a session beer no problem. Delicious. Not overly complex but you get a quality beer and the price is always good."
"Drinkability - This has been a great beer to end a decent beer drinking day! The beer is one id stock for sure and want to share with friends. Canada's struck again with a top beer!"
"Not bad, this used to be one of my favorite beers, haven't had it for about a year, until this review. Can't help but be a little let down by my old standby, sweetness was a bit too much with a weird lingering fruity aftertaste, too thin mouthfeel as well..."
"750ml Bottle ---- Pours deep mahogany with a nice, off-white head. Yeasty aroma, with fruity and brown sugar notes. Medium, tart body. Flavor is of yeast, dark fruit, brown sugar and some unpleasant chalkiness. There are much better Unibroue choices."
"It's pretty potent and pretty rich - definitely one a night for these. For that one beer, however, it's pretty easy to pick up and awfully difficult to put down."
"Drinkability - very drinkable, a heavier beer so it fills you right up"
"D - Very nice. Definitely a sipping beer at 9%, but a fine sipping beer for sure."
"Clear, brown, one finger tan head. No significant lacing. Strong wheat in the nose - reminiscent of a dunkelweizen. Perhaps a slight spiciness in the hops. Fruity start, then strong yeast presence. Dark fruit, raisins in the aftertaste. Heavy mouthfeel, decently carbonated. Drinkability is just so-so."
"O: Well balanced. Neither the sweetness, fruitiness or spiciness is overwhelming. The best part about it is the clean finish, which is hard to find in beers of this style, and makes it delightfully drinkable. Personally, though, I can't drink such sweet beers too much or too frequently."
"I had high hopes for this beer, but it ended up being my least favorite Unibroue offering that I've sampled (aside from an Ephemere). I'm surprised the ratings were this high."
"D - Considering the ABV, you better really watch yourself when your throwing these back or you may not be able to finish your review. Amazing."
"D- Very enjoyable and sweet. Slight bite is nice and warming. Very good beer."
"D- overall very enjoyable, but not blown away."
"99th in my bottle collection, hoping i can find some don de dieu soon."
"Picked up a handful of Unibroue beers recently, and this was the first one I cracked. Poured a clear, deep garnet color, with a little off-white head. Aromas of molasses, red grapes and plums. On the palate, full bodied, nutmeg, molasses, caramel and brown sugar. Heavy, and tough to drink a lot of these, but a good beer nonetheless."
"Pours an opaque black colour with 1/2"" of head that settles on top of the beer and stays there the whole time. There is a lot going on in the nose its almost overwhelming. Bready yeast, leather, plum, dried fruit with a touch of port wine kicking around. Also lots going on in terms of taste. Yeast, dried fruit and ripe plum with a nice effervescence, very complex. Medium mouthfeel that is just perfect. This drinks a little too well for 9% glad I have 4 more to put away for a while because this has made its way to my top 10"
"D: i find the alchohol content to be nearly none detectable, it's excellent and a little less yeasty to me than La Fin Du Monde. i could drink this all day, if only it weren't for the ABV that sneeks up on ya!"
"Overall this is a very good Belgian dark ale, but one of the lighter tasting versions I have experienced. A distinct apple/grape white wine qualities. Excellent nose, flavors, and mouthfeel. ABV is well hidden and it is drinkable but there are examples of the style I prefer."
"This is a fantastic beer and once again I'm impressed with Unibroue! Such beauty and depth to this beer. Rich red wine / port flavors mixing with Belgian candy and sweet malt along with a yeasty spice."
"Mouthfeel has a medium body, a little thick but not too heavy. Carbonation is mild, just enough to keep the body from being syrupy. Together it creates an image of Fall leaves."
"Great medium bodied mouthfeel. The drinkability is good for a beer this heavy."
"Pours a dark mahogany color with small cap of yellowish head and decent retention and lacing. Scent is of dark ripe fruit, sweet malts, touch of molasses, alcohol esters, strong yeast. Taste brings a fantastically complex blend of sweet, ripe fruits (prunes, cherry, raisin) with a delicate background of yeast, molasses and a big taste of booze on the back end. Medium bodied, active carbonation. A great tasting brew that has a touch of harsh alcohol on the nose and tongue and some fairly high carbonation from the bottle conditioning."
"I'm not a huge fan of the style, but every essence of this is a credit to the style itself"
"Overall, this is a very good beer. Not overly sweet or alcoholic and very drinkable, which could get rough if you have a case. Would highly recommend."
"This beer is definitely drinkable but lacks something that makes it truly stand out or allows it to be a session beer. ABV is reasonablly well covered and it is solid in the fundamental components."
"D - This beer is easily drinkable and tastes great. High alcohol doesnt come through at all but I definitely feel it after a while."
"D: Awesome."
"Medium body. Extremely well balanced. Complex and drinkable. A top shelf brew."
"D - I really enjoyed this one and was surprised at how well the ABV is hidden. There's a reason this one has a spot on the Top 100, and I would definitely recommend this to anyone who has the opportunity to try it."
"Overall I thought this was a pretty good strong ale, the harsh carbonation definitely brings the experience down just a little notch though."
"D: Quite drinkable. Though I personally dislike the vaguely sticky mouthfeel and that brief metallic flavor, I still enjoyed this beer."
"D-A good beer, but surprising that it is among the Top Beers on the Planet according to reviews on this website. Wouldn't make my top 100 and I won't buy this again. Novelty of it being in the top 100 has worn off for me."
"Drinkability- Tasty, and interesting, but I wouldn't go so far as to call it highly drinkable."
"Picked up a 4 pack of Unibroue from Rays in Wauwatosa. This is a excellent Belgian dark ale. With a medium body, this pours a rich brown mahogany. The taste has a lot going on; powerful fruits, yeast, and spice. All the flavor strikes a great balance with the 9% alcohol."
"D: Nice and relatively complex, but there are better brews to be found in this style; Belgian Strong Dark Ales are a loaded category, since they can describe such a gamut of flavors and aromas."
"Drinkability: While not your average beer, I expect big strong flavors from BSDAs. The aroma is fantastic, but complexity of the taste leaves something to be desired."
"750mL bottle poured into a La Fin Du Monde glass. Dark brown color with a tan head that fades away and leaves little lacing. Sweet aroma with dark fruits and yeast. Flavors are a bit light, the taste is malty and sweet with some dark fruits and spices. Alcohol is very well hidden. Fairly thin body, and over-carbonated. Not bad overall, but this is definitely not my favorite offering from Unibroue."
"D - This is more of a quad for me. To be a harsh critique I would say that it it lacks the authenticity of a Belgian Ale. A St Bernardus Abt 12 is a much better option."
"I was really expecting more from this beer. This score seems harsh, but at the same time I really feel that this is barely above average in the Belgian Strong Dark Ale style."
"D: This is an good example of the style, but I would like a little ""more"". From what I remember, I like Maudite better, going to open one of those next for comparison. Well worth trying for someone who likes Belgians."
"Pours a dark brown-ish color to almost black. In the aroma, roasty malt, white grape fruitiness, ad a caramel like hint. In the taste, white grape sweetness, and a bit boozy, and a caramel like end. A smooth and medium to bigger bodied mouthfeel, with a semi dry fruity aftertaste. A bit boozy, and a nice fruit presence. Not too shabby."
"It has a fair amount of carbonation that balances the alcoholic kick that this 9% abv puts out, but is still smooth and relatively drinkable."
"D: Medium. Nothing exceptional, but very drinkable. The bark was definitely bigger than the bite, as the flavor and mouthfeel missed their mark."
"Overall: I'd buy it again. Good solid beer."
"Dark mahogany colored pour with a massive, frothy, off-white head. Creamy dark fruit aroma with notes of toasted nuts, cocoa, raisin bread, clove, nutmeg, port, and some lightly floral funk. The flavor is a nice delicate balance of figs, plums, candi sugar, cocoa, almond, bread, raisins, and a little bit of alcohol with a floral spiced finish. Velvety medium body with moderate but soft carbonation."
"I plan to pick this up whenever I can get a hold of it."
"D: It is a sipper in a lot of ways but it drinks like a champ. The body is so smooth and the ABV is well hidden. I cut my craft teeth on them and Ommegang and they never disappoint. Also their beers age really well..."
"Yup a great brew worth the time to try. It is a fantastic desert brew. The price cant get any better for the quality of the brew."
"Overall an excellent brew. Rivals any belgian strong dark I've had."
"D - very drinkable."
"Very hearty and quite delicious throughout. Very very well balanced, though not as complex on the palate as I might have wished. Enjoyable none the less."
"While slightly disappointing considering the fame, very drinkable. Also, the warmer the better!"
"Very sweet aroma of ripe fruits. Smells of prunes, raisins, plums, and maple syrup. Poured ruby/purple in color with a huge tan head that mostly diminished but lasted throughout. No lacing. Cloudy. Almost opaque. Purple color looks like a Port or red wine. Sparkling. Flavor is moderately sweet and matches aroma well. Tastes of cola, grape, plum, raisins, and dark malts. Medium body. Very fizzy carbonation. One of Unibroue's better beers imo..."
"drinkability is fair, it is pretty tasty and easy drinking, just watch out for the 9% abv. And since it is a bit on the pricier side, i will not be drinking as many."
"9% ABV is hidden well with just a gentle warming finish. This is quite enjoyable, I'm not sure which I prefer - this or Maudite."
"Pour from a 12 oz. (too high) into a tulip glass; large head that lingered before dissolving into lacing. Nose is of dark cherries, taste has cherry as well alongside some dates and faint barleywine taste. Mouthfeel is unassuming; not heavily carbonated, but there is enough present to keep it from being wine. Taste seems... watery? Could be that I failed to dry the glass after washing, but still. Dangerously 'drinkable,' even sessionable; flavor is not potent at all considering the ABV; curious. Flavor improves on the second pour; likely some slight agitation will improve flavor overall."
"If you love strong, dark Belgians and are looking for one that's more available and affordable - you can't do wrong with this Quebec brew. It outshines many a 'real' Belgian."
"Taste is very Belgian inspired with some rowdiness and a bit of a sweetness. Mouthfeel is rich and full, prett easy drinking given the abv."
"D: An awesome beer... one of my favorite beers from Unibroue to date, and that's saying something with their line-up. Fantastic."
"Pours a dark brown with hints of red. Nice off-white head and ok lacing. Smells of dark fruity cherry and a hint of chocolate. Taste is really complex, the fruit with some mild bitterness. Quite a sweet beer. Quite aggressive carbonation. One of my favourite beers from Unibroue."
"D: The alcohol is very well hidden, which makes this beer relatively easy to drink."
"Don't get me wrong, this is a damn good beer, but it falls a bit short from great."
"Served from bottle into an Allagash flute. Poured dark brown with a one finger off-white head that quickly subsided to minimal. There was no lacing evident throughout. The aroma was comprised of malt, bread, citrus, and sweet sugar. The flavor was of malt, spice, and subtle citrus. It was light on the palate with mild carbonation. Overall this was a nice brew. Not the best of its style, but a pretty nice example. The flavor was very pleasant and the aroma was very complex. Worth trying for sure."
"D: Pleasantly sweet dark ale that makes for an excellent accompaniment with dessert or, as the label alludes, a great substitute for a port. Smoothness and light carbonation make it quite drinkable despite higher ABV."
"Consumed while grading papers : probably to the students benefit... ; > }"
"D - wonderful beer, nicely complex yet not flashy. alcohol, though not hidden completely, is kept in check and adds another dimension. a great one fro Unibroue."
"Drinkability: Overall, I would say this is a sipper, and I would probably try this beer again."
"Medium to light bodied, prickly on the tongue, with a fairly high level of carbonation that keeps the beer very drinkable and offsets the richness of this beer. Solid."
"Unibroue often falls short for me when I pit it against the big boys, most notably with Fin du Monde. Trois Pistoles on the other hand is a welcome addition to the world of BSDAs. Less aggressive than Huyghe, smoother than Bernard. Not necessarily ""better"" mind you, but it fills a space that no other beer quite manages to fill. Prost!"
"A solid offering from Unibroue. I enjoy their pale Belgians a bit more, but Trois Pistoles is a great beer if you're looking for something darker or to pair with dessert. I'd imagine this would be heavenly with some fruit-laden Crème Brulée. It's also a great beer to give to red wine drinkers to get them interested in the better form of alcohol!"
"The body is nice and thick. It's a cloudy brown that's very hazy creating a boatload of head. This is certainly a complex with a lot of flavors mixing together. There is some banana bread and what seems like some plumb and a touch of lemon. Think of it as a slightly toned down version of Aventinus that doesn't require as much chewing. A great find!"
"Nice rich flavors while remaining pretty light and drinkable."
"D: this is my favorite from Unibroue, nice balance, great overall execution and very authentic"
"D: Pretty good stout but not one I would want to drink very often. Blueberry works well with the roasted character of this beer, but it's not that noticeable and doesn't really add enough to this beer to make me want to choose it over a number of other stouts."
"Drinkability: The alcohol in this beer does become evident, but in no way is it too much. Great beer to sip on, or have with a meal."
"(Note: Just looked up homebrew recipes for this beer and saw that orange peel is indeed included in the recipe. So I'm not too crazy tasting orange in this beer.)"
"Overall this is a very drinkable dark Belgian. I was pleased."
"Deep chestnut with a ridiculously creamy head. Unibroue beers always have amazing, lush bubbles and mouthfeel. This one pretty much has to warm up a bit before being consumed, or else a trademark cardboard flavor will dominate. Prunes, malt, almost red-winey flavor. Still a little of that cardboard. A bit boozy, but still covers the 9% decently."
"D: This was a good beer, but typical for the style with no unique character or complexity. It had good body and hid the alcohol well, so it was easy to drink. It might improve with age, but it's only slightly above average fresh."
"D- I really enjoyed this. Unibroue is one of those breweries that doesn't make a bad beer. While Maudite and Fin Du Monde are more towards my liking, this beer definitely has the goods in its own right. A bit of aging could help this one as it seemed pretty hot."
"3.5 D: This is a pretty tame beer overall and one that just about anyone could enjoy. Indeed, I enjoyed it, but it isn't mindblowing. I love the flavor of Unibroue yeast, but prefer it in a better application (such as Maudite)."
"D: Very easy and pleasant to drink. Doesn't need any accompaniments. For it's dark color and high alcohol content, it's a surprisingly easy beer to drink."
"Medium body beer lingers on your tongue with the fruitiness, encouraging the next sip to reacquaint your tongue with the beer."
"Drinkability is pretty good, as it's a very nice-smelling beer with a decent taste follow-up. The booziness isn't masked all that much, but it's not an overpowering alcoholic quality, making Trois Pistoles easy to drink. Just be prepared to be a bit surprised. I know I wasn't."
"Mouthfeel is medium-bodied and silky. And drinkability is moderate and very easy to finish. The score suffers due to the slight muted flavors in the taste. Not bad, but not the best BSDA by Unibroue."
"Notes: Pretty good beer, but a little light (on both flavor and body) for the style. Nice rum/port like flavors in the background. Didn't taste extremely Belgian, but was tasty. Worth trying although maybe not worth stocking up on."
"M/D - Perfectly carbonated, medium body, finishes semi-dry. Grain dryness clears the palate quickly and leaves mouth dry. Very easy to drink, lots of flavors to explores and changes as it warms. High alcohol content not present."
"Overall this beer is dark, complex and rich but leaves me wanting a bit in some areas."
"Drinkabilty - What a great beer. SO much to offer. Its high alcohol keeps me from drinking 3 or 4 cause i like to find new flavors as i drink it. Doesnt get much better, world class"
"i'd say it has a medium bodied mouthfeel, creamy, with above average carbonation. all in all a very well built BSDA, just lacks that certain something which separates the very good and the great."
"750ml poured into a Duvel Tulip Glass. Very nice amber brown color, it glows to an amber/orange when you hold it up to the light. It's hazy can see some yeast bits floating around a little. Pretty thick head, lacing is nothing to really write home about but it's better than average I'd say. Smell is strong, mostly of Belgian malts and yeast, some dried fruit smell too. Taste is about on par with the taste, but I think I like it a little better, it's really strong, bold. Smells of dried fruit as well, figs, maybe cherries or cranberry it's tart as well. A little bready as well, would be a great deer around the holidays. Mouthfeel is pretty good, could be better. Has sort of a medium feel overall. The yeast makes it a little bigger in my opinion. Overall the drinkablility is good can easily polish off a bottle if in the mood for a Belgian. I'm actually still in the process of learning to like Belgian Beers, I've found a few that I enjoy and this one was pretty good. Taste has a lot going on, very full."
"Drink - Truly world class, and perhaps the best of the Unibroue's beers I have had thus far. I would glady purchase this beer again."
"I always enjoy the beers from Unibroue. Magnifique!"
"Overall: The taste and smell for me were kind of difficult to retrieve but overall it was good, the 9% ABV leaves you a nice buzz and its a very round beer."
"This beer has zip! Nice dark fruit flavors that are tart, rich and sweet without being heavy. I love the dry finish. A very easy drinking beer. Great job!"
"Sweet and spicy with some alcohol burn going down. Enjoyable and recommended."
"The mouthfeel is on the thicker side with a nice creaminess. Carbonation is moderate to slightly above average. Drinkability is good, it's a very tasty and easy drinking beer. Very nice version of the style and a nice beer to sip on this evening."
"It is a very good beer but not as yet complex as others I have drunk after. Doesn't live up to the memories, but still nice to revisit."
"drinkability: not a session beer, but nice an dry. good sipper for sure."
"d: an awsome beer that goes down easy. the 9% abv could sneak up on you."
"D-this is quite tasty and has a nice balance of a strong fruity malt presence and a nice citric hop finish. it is very sweet and juicy but not cloying at all."
"Full palate with lively carbonation. Drinkability is not great, but the beer is very enjoyable overall."
"D: Sweet, but quite drinkable. The 9% is not obvious in the taste, but the similarities to wine foreshadow the blow to come...Trois Pistoles can easily sneak up on you, especially if drinking from a 750mL bottle. I recommended sharing this brew betwixt friends; one glass is more than enough for me."
"O: Very solid showing from Unibroue, but not one of the top Strong Darks I have enjoyed."
"D: Nice to sit down and relax after work. Very good with some sharp cheddar and wheat crackers."
"It's like the dark, hedonistic brew of the gods!"
"This is almost dangerously drinkable. Great depth of flavor and no hint of the alcohol."
"Unibroue makes very drinkable and tasty high-octane ales, and this offering is no exception."
"Pours a very dark brown with a good sized oatmeal colored head. The head thins out but remains, lacing is pretty good. smell is ok, bit of fruitiness with a malt backbone. The taste is much like the smell, fruity with the sweetness of the malts. There's a lot of stuff going on, and it all plays well off each other. The mouthfeel is good, there's a little bit of heaviness there and the carbonation is good, but maybe a bit too much of it. Somehow even with all of the carbonation it still seems a bit thin. The drinkability is good, it goes down easily with little unwanted aftertaste."
"D: A very decent BSDA. It didn't quite knock my socks off, though. Still, recommended for fans of the style."
"This beer poured a very dark brown color with a good size tan head that stayed throughout the beer. It had a overall fantastic smell. Very heavy and a nice amount of a spicey note, also a little bit of a sweet smell. It tasted light for a belgian strong, but still flavorfull. An easy beer to drink flavor could have been stronger. Overall a good beer, there are better belgian strongs but this is still very enjoyable."
"Out of a Chimay goblet. Smells fruity and spicy, like you'd expect (says so on the label). That yeasty-belgiany-fruit flavor, however, it isn't as pronounced as some of the other beers of this style. You can taste the alcohol for sure. Nice and warming. More carbonated than I had anticipated but maybe I'm dumb and haven't had a big Belgian dark ale lately. Sweetness comes out more as the bottle warms."
"D- Very enjoyable and easy to drink. This would make a great beer to server with a nice dinner. I will be buying this again to age and keep around for something special."
"Drinkability - This one isn't as drinkable as many 9% abv beers I have tried, but it isn't bad at all. Seems a little warming at 9% so I probably won't have this one again until it gets a little cooler outside. Overall it was definitely worth the try."
"d: good..."
"D - One of Unibroue's better tasting offerings, I found it quite enjoyable and will come back to this as a great after dinner sipper, or perhaps paired with some figs and cheese. Despite the noticeable alcohol it was easy to finish off."
"Not much to look at, this has a great aroma like most of Unibroue's beers. Good flavors but nothing really spectacular to me. It's interesting especially in the fuzzy linger which in conjunction with the foamy mouthfeel, tend to overwhelm the flavors. Not my favorite from Unibroue but still very good."
"D: Not bad, but I don't see it as being as great as I though. Good brew from Unibroue."
"Verdict: Thoroughly satisfying, Trois Pistoles has lots of character and depth with surprisingly drinkability given the potency. It's just shy of earning top marks."
"jd"
"Drinkability: Due to the uninhibited alcohol taste, and the sticky aftertaste, this beer is 	fairly difficult for me to get through. Have to drink slowly and leaves me wanting more."
"d-Suprisingly drinkable for it's ABV. I think this beer would really be in it's element right after doing some work out in the cold. It's a real warmer."
"Drinkability- I would say it's really good. I will surely end up drinking more of it."
"Id rather sniff it then drink it."
"The best part about this beer is the high ABV and the ability to drink it. A 4 pack goes a long way, but disappears before you know it."
"D: The 9% alcholol is well hidden. Very drinkable."
"D - Very drinkable with the 9% ABV being dangerously hidden. I really liked this one, I'm not big on the style but I can see myself buying this one sometime in the future."
"d: Enjoyable to say the least. I had no idea it was 9%, i honestly thought it was 6.5-7.5% which i guess, really adds to this beer. Very nice but too clove-like to drink more than two of."
"D - Very high except for the 9%."
"d - good sipper that has wine-like characteristics."
"Poured into a Ommegang chalice a ""transparent black", or deep purple color. Thin white head and no lacing. Scent is of grapefruit notes with raisins and malts. The taste is about the same, grapefruit and raisins being prevelent. Not much of a yeast taste to it. The mouthfeel is highly carbonated but no alcohol burn."
"D: For the ABV, this ale is quite drinkable. A nice blend of flavors witch are rich and complex. Making this an all around drinkable ale for the style."
"D - For me, it was hard to put down. Once it's down, it stays down fairly well, though."
"D: rarely would one want another immediately after the first."
"D: A delicious complex beer which goes down very easily, but is noticeably intoxicating. A real joy of a beer that I will certainly have again."
"D - Goes down smoothly. Somewhat filling though."
"D: Complex and flavorful. This is a good sipper to relax in to."
"Drinkability: great flavor and drinkable body, the high alcohol content is the only thing holding this back. I recommend it."
"d - Another solid beer from Unibroue. I enjoyed the smell a little mroe than the taste, but something I would definitely try again."
"drinkability: alcohol well masked. Nice sipper."
"Its not my favorite, but would gain a recommendation for sure. My only complaint is that the flavor is so prevalent and ""unique"" that it does not go well with too many foods, and drinkability is diminished."
"overall this was a good beer, but not top notch and unfortunately i was slightly disappointed in it, i was expecting much more, but still this was a good drink, and i enjoyed it."
"d: still a good beer; seems to have mellowed after 2 years"
"Buy Again? Yes."
"Darkish red pour. Spice and citrus come through in the aroma. Great complexity like most Belgian styles. Spicy and grassy to start but then dark fruits, roasted malts, a little sweetness and a faint taste of alcohol. Great combination of flavors and perfectly carbonated."
"Overall, a good beer; great smell, taste and appearance."
"This is a very good beer. The clove spiciness could be a little less, but the flavors all meld quite nicely to make a delicious beer. This is a beer that could definitely improve with age."
"The feel of this beer is a bit light with a low amount of carbonation. There is a bit of a dry finish as it goes down but is smooth."
"Poured into a large wine glass. hazy brown color and bubbly sudsy head that falls to a thin ring. Aroma is complex: spicy, fruity and vinous. Flavor is a very complex mixture of fruit flavors, some dark malts, brown sugar, alcohol sweetness, spiciness, and aged hops. Mouthfeel is medium and warming and carbonation is strong. Overall, this is an excellent sit-down and sip beer and the beer world's answer to dessert wines such as port."
"D: this one grows on me. I can certainly put away a fair amount of wine, which this reminds me of, so it would be unfair to rate this harshly. 4"
"D - A beautiful beer. Different and exciting. Another good offering from Unibroue."
"Overall: The body of the beer is medium and the finish is medium full. This beer has a lot of flavors but it isn't uniform. I did enjoy drinking this beer but it lacks a lot of character."
"Drinkability: Goes down really easily for a 9% beer, probably because it's not overly sweet."
"This beer poured a dark, thick, brown, almost black, with a nice thick off white head that dissipated slowly. The smell was mostly of dark fruits, especially cherry. This showed through in the taste as a rich, fruity taste. Again, while there was the suggestion of several different kinds of fruit, I feel cherry was the stand out taste. Strangely enough, this beer's intense flavor didn't make it taste too heavy. With a surprisingly light mouthfeel, and a high ABV this could be a risky beer to drink multiples of as you might have the alcohol sneak right up on you. A delicious beer."
"Excellent beer. Another must have on hand from Unibroue."
"D - Well balanced and a definite crowd-pleaser. I am certainly glad I picked this one up."
"Libation: Anytime ABV creeps up near double digits, I'm concerned about how well the flavor balances it, here the ABV is near undetectable. This beer presents itself well, but isn't a world beater in my opinion."
"I certainly have gained much respect for Unibroue over the years - this beer did not hurt their rep one bit."
"Excellent beer yet another ""must have on hand"" year round. For the price a great bargain."
"Easy to drink, once the carbonation is gone. Its a great beer, just for $9 a bottle (Albertsons) I won't frequent it often, too bad cause if it was cheaper I would by alot more of it."
"D: Highly drinkable. Big fan of this all around and have to say I enjoy it quite a bit more than La Fin du Monde."
"D - Very drinkable for a 9% strong ale."
"Mouthfeel is good, not overly carbonated. Drinkablility is fair, I could see this one sneaking up on you pretty quickly."
"Beer is rather thin but really good. Sweet and bitter at the same time. It finishes cleanly with a light body but nice carbonation in the mouth. This beer is really good. not feeling very verbose tonight but I""m really enjoying it."
"Wouldn't drink as regularly as La Fin du Monde, but still a great brew. Excellent pairing with dark chocolate."
"D: I've always been impressed with Unibroue, and currently have the impression that they are the only ones on this continent that really capture the style that the Trappists have created. This is definitely worth picking up."
"This beer is 9% ABV so I caution against downing bomber after bomber. However, this is an easy-drinking beer despite its darkness and full body and you'll want to open another."
"From the 750 ml. bottle dated 06-12-10. Sampled on May 7, 2010. The cork pops off loudly with a good dose of mist filtering from the bottle. It pours just about black with a long lasting soapy beige head and light lacing. The aroma reminded me more of a wine with a kind of fermented fruitiness mixed in with the roasted malts and light hops. The taste is more akin to licorice and hard liquor than beer but I do get a hint of malts in the sharply bitter offering. Even though it is noit really my style, Unibroue continues to live up to its good name with this one."
"Caramel and alcohol. Sediment despite the careful pour. Fruity Imperial Newcastle? Have aged this a few years, is much better imho. BSDA is just not a style you should come to me looking for direction on. I'm not into them. This one was really no different, even though it was better than 90% of BSDA's I've ever had."
"What a great beer! Pours dark...seems black with hints of amber. Decent head although it didn't last long. Lots a smells from a seemingly endless supply of fruits. Taste was the same to me...dark, rich, fruity, load of flavors...almost hard to describe. All I know is that I really enjoyed it and would drink this beer anytime."
"Drinkability: Very nice BSDA, with lots of complexity, but a little subdued and watery. Still great, just not the best of the best."
"D: Too drinkable. Could probably clear a 6 pack of this stuff if I didn't pass out from the alcohol first. Really hides the ABV, great friggin' quad."
"I have had this beer many times but am just getting around to reviewing it. It reminded me why I like quads and suggested that this may be the perfect cold, rainy-day beer. I would normally reach for a porter or stout but I think this is so much more than most of those could bring to the table. It pours a deep, cider like reddish-brown. There was a two-finger head which quickly settled, leaving only light lacing. The nose was a blend of alcohol, raisins, cherry, clove, sweet malt and a yeasty aroma I can't describe. Carbonation is heavy. The taste follows the nose perfectly with the addition of some slight bitterness to temper the sweetness - a lovely interplay that really works. At 9% I certainly couldn't drink this all day/night but I might want to. This isn't my favorite Unibroue beer, but it is a great one, nevertheless."
"Mouthfeel and drinkability are standard."
"Very smooth drinking beer and at 9% ABV be very careful, this one could sneak up on you. Highly recommend this beer."
"M & D: There are several consistent qualities across Unibroue's spectrum of beers: The sound upon opening a bottle rivals a gunshot, the head fills the glass and fizzes out quickly, lacing will not happen, the taste lacks depth, the mouthfeel too light and thin, and then there is, of course, the trademark super fizzy effervescence which is almost always the highlight of the beer."
"Mouthfeel was medium bodied and it had some nice fizzy carbonation to it. Drinkability is good, definately not a brew to be chugged."
"Overall, a great beer, I don't drink a whole lot of bottled belgian, but this was one of the most balanced and easy drinking I've had. Was a perfect beer to break out the Tripel Karmeliet glass and get nice."
"Notes: Complex and very tasty. This is a dangerous brew, I could easily drink three or four glasses of this, but at 9% ABV you need to take it slow with this one."
"Drinkability: Very ""Drinkable"" as it's not to sweet nor does the alcohol show itself to much. Fits the style, it's complex and interesting but lacks an extra ""oomph"" in the nose and tongue to warrant a 4.5."
"D - for a 9% abv ale there is no trace of alcohol in the nose or taste. very flavorful with out being to cloying. one of the better belgian style darks i've had."
"Easy to quaff and overall unpretentious and inoffensive. This has a very well hidden alcohol and could likely be enjoyed by those who aren't beer savvy. My second favorite offering from them behind the great La Fin."
"D- What an excellent beer. I will pick this up again. Unibroue has never dissapointed. Ever."
"D - Very drinkable for the 9% ABV it carries. One of my favorites from Unibroue."
"Creamy, dense, flavorful. Hard not to like."
"Poured from a 12 ounce bottle with freshness date on back label. Dark brown, burgundy color with about an inch and a half of head that quickly fades to about a third of an inch. Sweet strong scents of fruits. Dark grapes and fermented scents. Heavy yeasty smells. Flavors of green apples and some fermented apples and grapes. No real hop flavor. Balanced malts. But more yeast flavors. Alcohol is well balanced with the flavor. Very drinkable and relaxing."
"Pours dark, Brazilian rosewood brown with a nice parchment head with fine bubbles. The aroma is sweet, with the essence of dark fruits. Prunes, black sweet cherry and blackberry. Also has spice notes of clove and pepper. Flavors include plum, cherry, port wine and clove. Also sensing some musty character and alcoholic warmth. This beer has a tartness to it that I think really brings everything together and takes it to the next level of enjoyment. Body is medium with smoothness at the start and sticky dryness rounding out the finish. The tartness lingers on the palate long after one swallows, leading one to take another sip. This leads us to the drinkability, which I think is pretty damn good for this style of beer. The first beer I tried from this brewery, and still my favorite. If the taste wasn't enough it also has sweet bottle art with Pegasus seemingly emerging form a fiery sky. Badass."
"Overall, this is among my favorite beers ever."
"Poured from the bottle, into my St. Bernadus goblet. Dark brown with an orangish-ruby tint. Head is ample, and tan in color. Laced slightly. Smell is greatly complex with the typical Belgian spice combined with some dark fruits and citrus. Taste is similar, with the various flavors molded together very well creating quite a smooth ale. Feel is lighter than expected and very smooth. Carbonation starts aggressively both smooths through the bottle. Really enjoyed this beer and will have to keep an eye out for it at the stores."
"There is the normal Unibroue fizz. I like Belgian Strong Darks now; Unibroue has helped with the approachable fruity, non-yeast dominated Maudite and now Trois Pistoles."
"I met Unibroue at an Oyster/Beer tasting ... the oysters were all Crassostreia Virginicas except for one Kumomota Crassostreia Sikameia. The concept was 12 oysters and 12 beers. 11 of the beers really sucked . . . Unibroue, on the other hand, was an interesting product ... and 3 Pistols was the best of the lot. Drinkability? I LIKE Imperial Stouts, Porters, etc. But I especially like versions that you can drink in some quantity, i.e., not excessively powerful. Ergo, I'm off to drink another 3 pistols ... except, BTW, the Unibroue La Fin de Monde is a slightly better oyster quaff for those who really dig the tasty bivalves!"
"Drinkability: This has that Unibroue taste. This is an above average dark ale where the alcohol is hidden for the strength. I could have a couple of these max. Complex, yet nothing I am going to rush to get again."
"This was a great beer to finish out the series. Really easy to sip on, and it had a nice fruity and spicy blend in the nose and on the palate."
"D: Very drinkable, alcohol is not very prominent so I'm sure it'd be easy to go overboard with this one. I intend on having the whole 750ml bottle though."
"D: decently easy drinking for a dark Belgian strong, but one bottle is plenty for me. An enjoyable drink for sure."
"Drinkability: Definitely a dangerously drinkable beer because of it's fruity tones that hide its ABV make it a deceptively delectable brew."
"Unibroue Trois Pistoles pours a bright deep red brown, with a nice creamy light brown head that lingers. The aroma is fruity, estery and slightly phenolic. Tons of dry yeast aroma and sweet dark fruit mingling nicely. The flavor is fruity and sweet upfront with the yeasty flavor giving way to a creamy, dairy like flavor. The dark raisin caramel maltiness comes through in the finish with a bit bit of bitterness. The alcohol is there, but pretty well masked."
"Another fantastic beer from Unibroue, making them one of my favorite, if not my favorite Canadian brewery. The wonderful appearance, combined with the layers of complexity in both the nose and palate, excellent mouthfeel, and dangerous drinkability makes this an exceptional brew. I enjoyed one of their other BSDA's, Maudite, just as much. Highly, highly recommended."
"good, strong beer,"
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a very dark brown color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of fruitsand spices, slightly sweet. Taste is good, dark fruits, spices, just a touch of alcohol, very balanced. Feels full bodied and tasty in the mouth and has good drinkability. Overall this is a fine quality beer."
"Overall Impression: This is truly Nectar of the Godz, and my favorite ale from Unibroue. The slightly higher carbonation is the only thing preventing it from being a perfect 10"
"winter and its perfect smooth dark and bubbly taste is what we need on a cold day. I like all of the Unibroue beers and I think they are among the best I've ever tasted, and I spent some time across the pond!"
"D - Overall very good beer, smooth and tasty."
"12oz. bottle served at 50 degrees in a tulip. Best by 02-18-11 indicated on the bottle. Pours a hazy brownish-maroon with a one inch loose, off-white head that begins to dissipate form the center outwards. Head eventually disperses into a tight band and some swirls - some lacing, but weak legs. Nose reveals dark fruit with a hint of yeast and candi sugar - takes on a slightly vinous quality towards the back. Taste consistent with nose - some acidity and carbonation level makes it taste a little soda-pop like. Mouthfeel is light-medium with a fairly aggressive carbonation that weakens the body slightly and leaves a residual burn at the back of the throat. A very respectable Belgian Strong Dark. Maybe a little too much carbonation, but not gassy by any means - another solid offering from Unibroue"
"Drinkability: This is definitely a sipper. Tasty, complex, and superb. It's a great brew."
"Poured into a pint glass this brew is almost a deep dark purple with a thick creamy head that leaves a 1 finger head with slight lacing on the glass. The aroma is of sweet plum, clove, mild malt and some raisin. The taste follows a traditional Belgian style with a nice clove and almost cinnamon spice start, sweet plum and raisin, with a touch of cherry left on my tongue in the finish. This is smooth brew but not sure how many I could session."
"Seriously, it was freakin' excellent. Nice, slightly fruity taste, just the right level of sweetness. I got this as part of their sampler case (La Fin du Monde, Maudite, and that strange apple stuff-think the wit beer woulda been the better fourth beer) for about $45 US at that famous and very large beer distributor in Emmaus, PA."
"A dark unibroue beer with the familiar unibroue fruitiness.Smooth taste with a nice head of foam after pouring into a tulip glass.Alcohol very hidden in this one. I personally cant keep drinking this one.Two and I move on to more of my beer collection.Unibroues beers are unique and uncomparable to the other beers out there. If you want to try something really different in flavor,go for the Unibroue."
"This is such a smooth, tasty and complex beer with everything you'd expect from a Belgian brew except for the price tag."
"Drinkability? This is no session beer, but as a sipper it's beautiful. I'll take drinkability to mean I could spend an hour with this glass and be happy straight through."
"J"
"I believe this is my favorite Unibroue beer now! A very nicely done strong dark ale, but then I do like dark beers. Highly recomended!"
"drinkability - this is one of my all time favs - so drinking a whole 750ml is no problem"
"Drinkability: Given the ABV of this beer it is very drinkable. Definitely an enjoyable beer and I certainly plan on buying more."
"Mouthfeel some carbonation not real full,a nice dry dark ale."
"Drinkability - I like this beer a lot, as I do most of the Unibroue beers. It's not my favorite Unibroue beer (that honor goes to 'Don De Dieu""), but it's a very close second and a good representation of the BPSA style with a little more emphasis on the malts. I would drink this again for sure."
"Overall, not a bad beer, but I'm still a little unimpressed with Unibroue."
"Pours a deep ruby/chestnut/mahogany hue with a foamy light beige head out of a 355ml bottle. The head has little retention, but loads of carbonation are constantly rising from above. The nose was overwhelming grape juice. There are other dark fruits like cherry and plum, but the grape dominates. You also get a hint of alcohol in the scent. Has a grape juice/wine blast at first. Then there are subtle hints of the Belgian influence. Lots of clove and a tiny banana note. The carbonation was just over the top for me. I enjoyed the taste but felt the biting carbonation detracted from the overall enjoyment of the beer."
"This is a good effort."
"Overall, this is not one of my favorites from Unibroue, but still a pretty dang tasty beer nonetheless."
"*= ideas from fellow taster"
"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a goblet. Bottle has a ""best by"" date of 7-14-2012. Pours a coca-cola black, with a slight tan head. Decent lacing, but not much head retention. Smells are dark fruit, caramel, touch of chocolate. First taste gives a huge alcohol burn, spices, molasses, very sweet. Drinks thick, rich, medium body. Medium-high carbonation which seems to be a recurring theme in Unibroue brews. Drinkability is good, definately a beer that is meant to be enjoyed and not guzzled. Excelent beer!"
"D- Smooth with a bite on the back of the tongue as it goes down."
"Drinkability is pleasant. A nice take on the Belgian Strong Dark Ale."
"(draught) very dark with creamy light brown head. Nose is like most other Unibroue offerings -- heavy on the plum/raisin with a slight spice and yeast. Sweet and smooth with a light carbonation. Alcohol was not overbearing! Another good ale from Unibroue."
"Drink is good. A little dissappointing seeing how this was such a highly rated beer. I wasn't all that impressed."
"Body is medium, yet it feels light and alive. The initial feel is good and sharp from the carbonation, it soon settles down to a smooth creaminess. Finish had a somewhat interesting slimy feel. Despite the 9% ABV the beer goes down really smoothly, better watch out after a few though."
"I would have liked this even better had the alcohol been masked a little more. Overall, this is a nice Belgian style brew that I would't hesitate to revisit. Unibroue, as usual, impresses again."
"Pours a very dark amber, nearly opaque. Carbonated bubble float quickly to the top to take care of what small head this beer produces. Smell is earthy and dark. Sweet fruits, raisins, cherries, and hints of chocolate. Taste is quite bold, with cherries striking me followed by an some subdued earthy hops. The carbonation is is balanced well in the medium feel of this beer. Delicious."
"(12 oz bottle into tulip) Pours a deep black with a half finger creamy light brown head. Nose is like most other Unibroue offerings -- heavy on the plum/raisin with a slight spice and yeast. This one was a little sweeter though, almost as though the fruit were slightly sweetened or barely dessicated. Very smooth and velvety in the mouth with a light carbonation that enhanced the sweetness of the fruit and allowed some spice to develop after. Alcohol was very well hidden again, so be very careful if you want to try more than one! Another top notch ale from Unibroue, which is quickly becoming one of my favorite breweries!"
"M/D: Body is light to medium, excellent carbonation, certainly not as creamy or as thick as expected. The beer is smooth and easy to drink."
"Got to be may favorite Unibroue offering. Nice!"
"I highly recommend tasting this beer on tap. It is an ENTIRELY different experience. At least twice as flavorful. Definitely inching up the list of my favorites."
" A wonderful Belgian-style ale, my favorite of the Unibroue line."
"Cheers."
"Value: As with most of the Unibroue brews I have tried, worth every cent."
"D - very good but not as complex or rich as other belgian strong dark ales. still a very good beer"
"D - great fruity bread/grain flavors"
"Overall I really enjoyed the beer but it seemed to good to have it along with other expensive beers so I may try this again some time this year."
"D - Flavorful and easy to drink. High ABV makes a 750 enough for an evening and the rich flavor medley is a bit filling."
"Pours a dark copper color with some red edges and almost no head and no lacing. The aroma is of sweet malt and caramel malt with dark fruits, plums and black cherries present. There is also some yeast notes as well. The taste is of a caramel malt backbone with hints of plums, cherries, and raisins in it. The taste isn't as big and bold though as i had hoped for it was a little disappointing compared to maudite. The mouthfeel is moderately carbonated. The drinkability is average you could drink a lot and enjoy them but I was left wanting a big flavor."
"Notes: I was a little bit let down with this beer. La Fin du Monde is the only Unibroue I had drank before this, but I'm not sure Trois Pistoles quite lives up to that."
"Drinkability: I've enjoyed this beer before, and will do so again in the future. It is well balanced and complex. While it doesn't rock you back on your heels the way some of the top Trappist BSDAs do, it is much more approachable and quite tasty. Definitely recommended."
"Fermented on the lees this dark ale has immensely enjoyable creamy mouthfeel. At 9% it doesn't taste like it. Aroma has a hint of grape and it pours dark with a hint of ruby which belies its port wine flavors in the finish. Great beer I enjoyed every drop and it was gone all too quickly."
"This is a great beer, one I would drink regularly if it were available to me in such a manner."
"D – Not my favorite, but well-crafted and certainly worth considering."
"For a drink with such high alcohol content, it does have a great drinkability to it."
"Good stuff but after hearing so much about this beer I was expecting to get my socks knocked off. Much to my chagrin, I am very much still apres socks. Regardless, $7 a bomber for good Belgian ale--I'll take it."
"D: The alcohol content at 9% is evident with every sip. Luckily, the complexity of this beer mask it as much as it can. Great beer to drink slowly and enjoy, not one to crack open again and again."
"Drinkability is initially very high. As the beer warms, the alcohol and strength of the brew become more present. This is a sipper."
"This was delicious! But very alcoholic. Pours to a cloudy dark brown almost like coke but a little bit lighter. Alcohol shines through in the aroma with some sweet notes. Strong yeasty flavor and alcohol are most prevalent with some sweet notes that I couldn't place."
"Overall what can I say, another really great beer from Unibroue that is extremely enjoyable by itself or with a meal. This beer is best enjoyed a little slowly, but I prefer it with a bit of chill so don't let it sit too long. A great keg that I will enjoy. Cheers."
"O: Extremely drinkable beer. Dispite of the Belgian influence, the Canadians of Unibroue were able to do it their own way. Unibroue beer have personality and are well done"
"Very drinkable , glad I bought a four pack of 12 oz's instead of the 750 ml bottle for saving for later...."
"Overall, an elegant beer with a load of complexity, yet an overall soft character."
"D- Because its complexity , high carbonation and alcohol volume it is a one time beer to enjoy slowly for the night.Good job as usual from Unibroque brewery."
"Medium bodied, high carbonation, and the alcohol is not hidden at all. A nice beer to drink all the same, and I can honestly say that so far every beer I have had from Unibroue has been a winner."
"D: I used to regard this one as the best Unibroue beer, but after having had it a few more times over the course of my palate evolution, I think it was more nostalgia than anything. This was one of my first gateway beers into the craft world, and sadly, it's not able to be much more than that. It's been relegated to my standard of an ""average"" BSDA."
"D: Due to the complex flavors and high ABV, this is an excellent sipper but not exactly a session. Would make a great aperitif along with dark chocolate or sharp cheese."
"I enjoyed this beer when I was able to try it at a beer tasting. I found it had more interesting flavor when aged for 1 year. It quickly became a favorite when the aged version was introduced to me. As for the overall taste of the beer when enjoyed fresh, I fel that it was a decent beer with a bouquet that was not overwhelmingly unique and muted flavors."
"Good sweetness and fruit makes Trois Pistoles stand out from the already strong Unibroue lineup. Dark, nearly opaque burgundy liquid with a creamy off-white head. The aroma is maltier and doughier than most from Unibroue. With notes of raisins, plums, bananas and clove, there are many dark Belgian-style fruit flavors from the yeast and malt. The flavor is mildly sweet for the style but still right in the normal range for a good quad/BSDA. Mouthfeel is full and lively. All of Unibroue's beers are well-made. Trois Pistoles is a very nice BSDA. I have no real qualms with it, but I'm not sure how well it would stand out against a field of the top examples of the style."
"Superior. Not the best thing Unibroue has made, but not one to miss. If you've never had a beer from this brewer and like the dark Belgians, recommend trying one or two."
"D: So So drink ability, I like this beer but I won't want another one tonight, it's not heavy but is 9% alcohol by volume."
"D- It's a little sweet to drink a lot of, but I felt 12 oz was a very manageable portion. It's more of the style than the beer itself and not necessarily the alcohol, more the flavors."
"Drinkability: Just 2 please. I'll be good for the rest the night."
"I love this beer, one of the best from Unibroue."
"D: Not nearly as good as the Maudite I just had. Damned decent none the less. Certain sipper, not much of a quaff."
"Very dark brown, almost black, pour. Translucent. No head on the beer. Spicy Belgian nose with some dried fruit (raisins maybe?). Moderate alcohol up front. Lots of carbonation. Sweet fruit and some spicy Belgian finish. Bitterness afterward. Nice palette. Overall pretty good, but not my favorite Unibroue offering."
"Something for a nice evening in winter around the fireplace, or a similar setting."
"Poured a nice deep brown/black with two fingers of sepia-colored head that laced very well, into a snifter. The nose yielded molasses, caramel, cocoa powder, bittersweet chocolate, dark plum, and malt. The flavor yielded all of the above in copies amounts, but also revealed more sour/tart fruitiness..plum and cherry...which surfaced mid-palate through the finish. Furthermore, the finish also revealed the alcohol content, and left some alcohol-induced warmth afterwards. Silky, medium body; just a fantastically flavorful beer to sip appreciatively, or pair with a good meal. My only knock on this beer (if I was forced to pick something) is that when it warmed to room temperature, the sweetness was a little too much."
"D - Drinks easily if you're accustomed to these kind of beers. But watch out, the alcohol will hit you if you don't stop before it's too late!"
"Overall I find this beer to be an exceptional North American representation of a Belgian Strong Dark Ale. Unibroue has quite the line up, but this Maudite and La Fin Du Monde slightly stand apart from the rest. Recommended."
"D: 9%? uh oh this beer is far too drinkable can lead to disaster, drink with caution."
"D A little sweet with a bit of funkiness, but not overdone. A somewhat complex beer with higher alcohol that is still quite drinkable."
"overall i remember a night a while back that involved this brew and a bonfire which ended in some charred crocs for me..but i still come back for more.."
"This is full bodied and the carbonation does a great job of softening and melding the flavors together. Very smooth. Highly drinkable."
"Final Notes: It's an interesting, albeit not extremely inventive, take on the style. Probably my favourite of the Unibroues. Still theres something about the yeast that I just am not a huge fan of. Also, their beers never give enough head for my personal taste. But enough about that, this beer is pretty damn solid and is better than a lot of stuff Ive had."
"Damn. Unibroue is just killer. I want to drive out there and give them all a sincere hug. This beer to me really does seem like Fin's cousin. I guess that should be expected. I think it should also be appreciated. The fact that I can get it from ""The Beer Store"" in 6's makes it a highly rated ""go to"" beer for me now, because frankly, I couldn't care less about it's appearance."
"Nice chocolate malt flavor that is roasty, but not too much so. Lots of estery dark fruit notes, especially raisin, fig, plum and sour dark cherry along with sweet candy sugar notes. Very well balanced. Highly recommended!"
"overall a really great quality beer, the smell is really something else, and the taste is just complex enough to be interesting. Good stuff, definitely recommend it."
"Very nice dark appearance. Has a near perfect mouth feel with just the right amount of carbonation. The smell is really nice and makes you excited to start drinking it. Has a very sweet bite at first that then dissipates into a mellow after taste that makes me feel like I just took a bite of an apple. I could probably drink this beer all day long and never get tired of it."
"Drinkability - This is a beer to reach for to enjoy for the rest of the evening. Excellent burst of flavor, only slightly sweet, many wonderful complex flavors, mild bitterness, clean finish - Extraordinary!"
"the drinkability is great for the alcohol percentage"
"When I first got in to craft beer I just didn't get any of unibroues offerings until I had this one. Now I enjoy them all, but this is the one that started it for me. I've got a bunch of these in the cellar now, I can't wait! As a side note, this went really well with the spicy peanuts I had."
"Taste is incredible. Definately pick up the dark fruits. Very smooth. Leaves a nice flavor on the tongue, almost resembles wine."
"Complex, but balanced taste overall. Definitely taste the sweetness, but it is very drinkable. Masks the alcohol very well and is very enjoyable. Label art is an added bonus."
"Poured a dark, brown, cloudy color with 2 big fingers of head that faded slowely. Smells of roasted malt with some grape and yeast aroma in the mix. Taking a sip, the flavor fills the mouth with a chewy sweetness. A mild bitterness builds on the back end followed by a surprisingly clean finish that leaves you wanting more. The only downside is a slight medicinal note, probably due to the high alcohol content. Overall, a freakin' awesome beer!"
"Overall a memorable and enjoyable beer. I got this in a very affordable Costco four-pack that only set me back a few bucks for the bottle. If I see them come up again, Trois Pistoles will be a good reason to snag that Unibroue mixed pack."
"Had this again over a year later. Really enjoying it this time around. Have had a better appreciation for belgians lately, and this is quite delicious."
"Not particularly complex with alcohol to evident the beer is to sharp to go down smoothly. Anyway, this is a decent dark strong Belgian but only if none of the originals is available."
"D. An elegant and uinque beer. Very delicous."
"A very good example of the style, but lacks the remarkable alchemical synergy of La Terrible. Perhaps a year or two in the cellar would be the remedy - I'll have to report back after concluding such an experiment."
"Overall - This is not really one of my favourite Belgian style dark ales, but it is still very good."
"Pours a magnificent dark brown with a thin head and some lacing. Smells of chocolate, vanilla, very sweet with a hint of some spices as well. The taste is incredibly complex. First it hits you with a bit of the spice, then it mellows out to a sweet, fruity blend, including apples. Extremely well balanced between the two. No hint of the alcohol, which is interesting considering its 9%. This makes it extremely drinkable."
"Exceptionally smooth, velvety mouthfeel. Highly drinkable for the amount of alcohol in there. By far one of the best Unibroue beers and the best BSDA I've had to date."
"Overall, an exceptional beer. BSDA is a hit or miss style from me but this one knocked it out of the park. For me, this is the best BSDA by far. Outstanding. Rotation: avail here. Now that I've rediscovered it this one will be in the regular rotation."
"Smells like a plate of alchohol-soaked burned brownies (in a good way) with a leafy/grassy high note. Tastes is dry and clean, but thick and chewy going down. A bit of tightness, mineral aftertaste."
"Mouthfeel is spot on for the style. This is a great beer other than that tiny bit of metal I tasted. It was a small enough amount though that I began to not even notice it after a while."
"D: Very drinkable almost to a scary point due to the high alcohol content. You definitely need to drink more than one to truly appreciate the complexity of this brew."
"I can't say that I'm blown away by this beer in any way, but it doesn't do anything wrong either. It's just a very, very good beer all around."
"I liked how, even though it was a high gravity beer, it was uncharicteristically light and balanced, not EXTREMELY heavy on the fruit or the warmness of the alcohol, but a bit too much sweetness for my tastes."

"medium bodied,a little bit more carbonation than average.overally a really drinkable belgian strong dark.one of my favorites and a definite go to. goes well with a wide variety of foods too."
"We've been aging a bottle of TP for about 2-3 years now in our cellar, and we decided to open it tonight for a special occasion. Huge pop of the cork, and some foam starts to gush out. Certainly did not lose any carbonation over the years. In the glass, it formed a huge head. But, it did look really good and fluffy. Dark brown color, with an amber glow. Smell was loaded with ripe fruit like plum and fig. Taste was exceptional. This rivals any Trappist dubbel I've had in a while. Fruity and sugary, but balance with a slight hint of alcohol. Very velvety mouthfeel. A pleasure to drink. Great pre-dinner drink paired with a wedge of blue cheese. Will be re-stocking the shelves with more bottles of this for sure."
"Pours a clear, super dark brown, almost black, with a thin tan head. Smells of ripe plums, and freshly cut wood. Taste is of ripe fruit up front, smooth malt middle, spicy belgian yeast, and a dry, dextriny, woody finish. A hint of alcohol, but barely detectable. Mouthfeel is smooth, slightly high carbonation. Very drinkable, this is an excellent Belgian Dark ale, I certainly plan on getting this again."
"The carbonation is very nice, even and not too intense, but lasting across the whole palate. Like the head, this beer held up nice throughout the session from a carbonation standpoint. I felt this beer finished a little hot with alcohol present in the close. I think this hurts the drinkability, though I am not sure you group a dark belgian ale if you want to knock back a few quick ones."
"I'm still getting used to the Belgian style brews but they are definitely growing on me. A definite recommendation."
"The mouthfeel is great."
"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle in to a Chimay goblet. Dark brown color with great head and froth. Some lacing down the glass. Smell is amazing, dark fruits, sugar (candy). Taste is even better, especially as the beer warms in my glass. Tastes are complex; fruits, malts, sugars; the combination is incredible, and very delicious. Mouthfeel is also awesome, carbonation surrounds the tongue and throat. Drinkability is high, as the taste is super. I vow to always have this beer at hand in my house."
"Mouthfeel: Slightly thinner than expected, but certainly not watery. Moderate to light carbonation throughout."
"Drinkability: this is a sipper, if only to appreciate its qualities, notwithstanding its high alcohol content. Very tasty, but not a session drink for me."
"D- I really enjoy a good belgian ale and could definitely work this into the rotation this winter as it cools down."
"D-Wow, this is the stuff. Now I can't wait for cooler weather."
"This is my second Belgium strong. I still need to develop my palate for this style, but I am very intrigued by the feel and flavors. They are very mysterious and complex. This beer is amazing."
"yet another new favorite from Unibroue I cant get enough of their strong ales. i said this about la fin du monde and I'm saying it again the best value i can buy in Calgary"
"Drinkability: I like this one better than Maudite, which seems to be more highly regarded. This one is more like a real Belgian dark than Maudite is, but still not quite there. A little to thin and lacking the dizzying complexity found in the best examples of the style. Overall though, its a tasty, inexpensive alternative."
"bubbly and airy, goes down smooth, with a hint of alcohol."
"I personally liked this beer, was different, but good. For such a strong beer I didn't notice the alcohol. Smell was like fresh fruit apricots or plumbs. Taste was definitely strong of plumbs and spices. Color was a rich ruby color with a tan head. Was very fruity. Was allso a fairly thick and bubbly beer. Overall I could handle a couple of those beers despite the high alcohol unlike the maudites which for some reason hit harder despite the lower abv."
"Drinkability: Excellent beer. Something I would like to get again...and again and again."
"D: I don't know, even though the ABV isn't TOO high and it's not TOO heavy, I think this beer would get to me pretty fast. Too fast."
"D - goes down easy, this makes for a great after dinner beer. this reminds me of the months to come. I am actually looking forward to kicking back by the fire w/ a few of these and some good old movies this winter."
"The mouthfeel is fairly smooth and creamy, but is then interrupted by a little too much carbonation and harsh wine like flavors. I feel like the drinkability and overall flavor of this beer could be enhanced if the malts were allowed to come through more. I've had other beers with a strong wine presence that I've liked but this one doesn't really do it for me. Not a bad beer, but not the first dark Belgian or Unibroue that I would go for."
"This is drinkable, and I would say it is more drinkable than others given the thinner feel."
"This is one hell of a beer."
"Opaque brown with a respectable bubbly head that quickly dissipated. The aroma of aged dark fruit was there for me. It had slight cola taste to it, and also sour black cherries. No aftertaste. A little carbonation left even at the end for the tongue to play with, medium bodied. No discernable difference as it warmed up. I found it similar to Rochefort 8, which I was not impressed with. I will probably drink again, especially if I can find it on tap.	I think it could be that I do not like the style Belgian strong dark ale."
"This is damn near perfect. Now which is better, this or Brooklyn 2? My money is on this...."
"D - @ 9% ABV it's moderate to low, but it isn't out of character for this style at all."
"This is one tasty beer, highly recommended."
"D- Me second beer from Unibroue, and I enjoyed this one a lot more than the first. Really an amazing beer. I'm looking forward to trying some more from them."
"Poured into a Chimay goblet which allowed the brownish plum colored brew to retain a small amount of head. The lacing was not there, but it was still a pretty beer. Dried fruits and great smelling spices and esters throughout. More raisins and old dried dark fruits in the tastes. It is supposed to be an old beer and it is. Taste like something that has tons of character. I love the diversity and complexities here. I didn't feel like I had 3/4 of a litre of 9% liquid either. Nice drinkability. I like this one much more than the Maudite I had the other day."
"D: Big, bold, and sweet, but it's still a pleasure to drink. An excellent strong dark ale, probably one of my favorites to date from Unibroue."
"Pours a dark brown, almost black and opaque with a three finger head that recedes quickly to a coating on top of the beer. The head is very fizzy, light tan and not creamy at all, not lacing is left by it down the glass, this takes away from the appearance. The smell is good, belgian yeast, a good amount of fruits/citrus, maybe some raisins in there too. Tastes of belgian yeast, fruits, definately heavy raisins in here, good spice, alcohol comes in here but in a good way, malts, a very complex overall taste. The mouthfeel is good here too, smooth medium body with a PERFECT amount of alcohol warming on the tongue, mouth is coated with an aftertaste of raisins and dark fruits. Alcohol in this beer is great, it is used tastefully, there is presence but it does not taste chemically or over the top. Drinkability is good here too, it is not too heavy, the alcohol presence is good but not over the top, you get a good example of a dark belgian beer for a good price, have had this before and will continue to drink it and other Unibroue brews."
"D- A little boozy upfront but still goes down very easy."
"Drinkability: Because of how light this beer is, but yet so complex in taste and aroma I can drink this all day. I mean WOW I am in love with this beer. Also, even though I can feel the 9% alcohol there is no way I could tell from drinking this beer. I mean this beer is DEADLY. Deadly delicious that is."
"This seems to have a less dominant yeast character (than the other Unibroue beers), I'm pretty sure that's why I've rated it so much higher."
"Another great beer from Unibroue. I have yet to have a bad one from this brewery."
"drinkability: this is a thoroughly drinkable brew from Unibroe"
"I could see myself having more than one of these, if I had a designated driver. Still, pretty drinkable for the style."
"The complexity of this beer is seemingly endless. All of a sudden the flavour seems to have shifted to chocolate and roasted red peppers, but still all the while maintaining its intricate port-like temperament. How can this be so supple and smooth, both warming and mellow, spicy yet sophisticated? Bordeaux, Chianti, Rioja, Madeira... what's missing? Chambly."
"drinkability: overall I appreciate it and it';s a great example of a belgian dark ale"
"Mouthfeel is mostly smooth with just a touch of prickly carbonation. Finish is somewhat dry. Pretty good stuff here, I never would have known this was 9% just by tasting it. Everything is very well balanced and there's enough going on in the taste to almost completely mask the alcohol."
"MF&D - the body is not quite right, too thin and not enough muscle, carbonation is a bit weak to."
"D - Very drinkable. This is complex and well balanced with great dark sugary character that does not become the least bit cloying. It is hard to believe, but this is a sessionable beer despite its 9%ABV."
"The taste is typical to that of a belgian strong dark ale. Not nearly as complex as a Trappist ale, but the yeast strain is very smooth and really strings all of the flavors together. Nice rich dark cocoa, some vanilla, some sweet banana, belgian candied sugars, and clove. Really nicely done from the homies up north. Some nice fruit flavors rise out of the malt sweetness as the beer warms, mostly plum and raisin. The mouthfeel is a well carbonated and dances well on the palate. Would definitely go with this any day of the week."
"Pours a very dark brown, nearly black. Seems to be very well carbonated, although the foam doesn't seem to last. A swirl brings it right back. Nose is characteristically Belgian with a nice fruity spice despite the dark hue. There's also a bit of chocolate aroma with a faint alcohol sweetness. This is a medium light bodied drink, which I always love in big dark beers. The taste is particularly fruity and spicy with a sweet malty finish. Hops are not in the forefront by any means, but there's a slight bitterness that really ties this whole thing together. This is a wonderfully delicious beer and I look forward to enjoying a LOT more of it in the future."
"ENJOY."
"(D)- Despite its 9%abv, this brew certainly doesnt feel as such. However, I remember this beer to be much better than this. I think it is much more successful from the larger 750mL bottles for some reason. Still a solid beer though."
"D - Not my favorite beer from unibroue. This is more of a dark, imperial witbier."
"Unibroue, as usual, did a fantastic job with this beer and I will try it again when I can find it."
"Nice brown color with a tinge of red. When I first smelled it I got a nuttiness that reminded me almost of Amaretto then a fruit smell. The taste reminded me of fresh figs. I expected the beer to feel thicker than it was. I also found the carbonation to be nice. Everything I have tried from Unibroue has been different and interesting. This beer is certainly worth exploring."
"This beer is my introduction to Belgian strong dark ales. Hopefully others will be as good as this."
"D: A very fine Unibroue brew. Robust without being overly heavy with a dark, earthy quality that is inherent in Unibroue beers."
"That this is a 9% ABV I find alarming. Much, much too drinkable."
"D: Probably my favorite out of the Unibroue's I've had, I could see myself drinking a couple of these without a doubt. I will most likely get this one again."
"12 oz bottle into a tulip, poured a beautiful dark, brown with a nice head and great carbonation from the yeast. Smeeld malty, sweet and a bit like coffee. Coffee hints were presnt in the tase as well, along with notes of licorice and rich caramel. Deep fruits and banana scents also lingered. I loved this beer and would love to drink it all night."
"d- ABV creeps up quickly. Big time sipping beer, and one at that. Has a lot of character and is quite complex. Back of my mind so thinks Chimay blue in every respect but this is a dark ale. Biggest negative is the sweetness in this beer. Has a coke like quality to it in the sweentess. An excellent beer but in my mind a late fall/winter beer. Not nearly as good as La Fin Du Monde is but an excellent beer still."
"D: A fantastic offering from a fantastic brewery, almost light enough to qualify as refreshing, if of course the alcohol were not factored in. A great sipper, though would probably be more fitting as a winter brew instead of a hot and heavy summer night sipper as it is at the moment of this review."
"Overall, very easy to down this - even at 9%. Could easily have two in one sitting."
"Overall, one of my favorite offerings. Damn near perfect broue."
"M&D: at 9%abv., this full-bodied beer drinks very light indeed, as the carbonation level is most smooth and any alc. feel is kept at bay by the slightly lower serving temp. A delicious ale all round!"
"Overall I really like this one, its not the best unibroue beer but its definitely a good one. As far as Belgian Strong Dark ales, it fits the characteristics but its not breaking any barriers."
"This onee is going down fast for 9%. Really easy to drink -- terrific stuff and by far my favorite from Unibroue."
"The yeasty character from the lees added later brought a fullness to the beer but did not overpower. I would enjoy with the lees at the end."
"taste is fizzy, prunes, raisins, malt, cocoa powder, and a few hops in the back, ends dry and a little bitter."
"Drinkability is pretty high if you like this style of beer. I've always been a big fan, although it's been awhile since I've had one of these classics, and admit it seems a bit simple."
"Overall I have to admit this one was pretty damn good. Not the best, but very solid and I am glad I got a chance to try it on tap."
"Goes down smooth and smells real nice, but I'm really not picking up that much flavour here. It definitely doesn't taste bad, just doesn't taste like much. I would still buy this again though, as a good smooth, strong dark ale. I just wish it tasted like it smells."
"12 oz. bottle into tulip. Pours a very dark, murky brown with moderate beige head which mostly dissipates. Thin lacing throughout. Very, very pleasant aroma of dark fruit (raisin, fig, plums), slight caramel and vanilla, wood and hint of alcohol. Also well-carbonated throughout. Wonderful flavor and excellent finish of dark fruit. Yes, it has a kick but to me is well hidden. It is enticingly smooth & mellowfor its style and ABV. Yeast formations remain with head. Getting better as I partake of this great beer - a rival to the trappists IMO and cannot wait to have my 2nd - Cheers!"
"Pours a deep murky dark-brown with a booming slightly off-white head that is very bubbly and quickly dissolves to create a nice layer across the glass. The aroma is full of fresh berries with some yeast and a touch of alcohol. Flavor is sweet plums, slight bready malts and some dried fruits which I'm having a hard to naming. Its a very light beer and more than efficiently carbonated. Even before I knew what good beer was all about, this beer had me hooked from the first time. Extremely enjoyable."
"Drinkability: Absolutely great for a beer with a high ABV, you obviously couldn't drink many, but you'd want to. I think its less intense then la fin du monde so its a faster drinking beer. I still prefer la fin, but this is a different style. A great strong ale. Not complex enough for my palate to award an A+, but it is up there."
"Overall a recommended try for all Belgian lovers which I am myself!"
"Very smooth with a nice full carbonation. Unibroue very rarely disappoints."
"The mouthfeel on this beer dances on the edges of being full and delicate. Very nice Strong Dark. Highly recommended."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with strong carbonation."
"- Would be more drinkable if it wasn't so carbonated... way too much bubbly... although the strength was hidden very well and it had a very smooth and crisp flavor... but I probably wont buy this one again. I like the La Fin Du Monde much better... and look forward to trying the Mudite or whatever its called.."
"Unibroue proves again that drinkability, complexity, high alcohol, and a reasonable price for the quality of the product may dwell in harmony in the same bottle. And yes, harmony can require a small sacrifice from everyone involved."
"A very nice beer, didn't really blow me away, but very solid belgian that is very drinkable and not overly sweet. Dry, spicy and delicious."
"Trois Pistoles is more delicious and refreshing than the smell and alcohol content would indicate. This would be good at the end of a long summer day or with a rich dessert after a winter holiday meal."
"Sampler best before 9/3/11"
"Finish contains a grainy winterwheat finish with a touch of sweetness and yeasty sugars. Strong 9% ABV, but finishes remarkably well."
"Mouthfeel- rather vinous with some sweet flavors. Fruit flavors that bring out some of the cidery flavors/ some tartness. Good but nothing too complex, not bad. A froth on the palate releases the alcohol which is well-hidden. the label says it hints a port wine and that flavor is present to me at the finish. The grape comes through. I received a Unibroue sampler for my birthday. I have never really been drawn to their brews, but impressed so far."
"This is a good beer, but certainly not my favorite from Unibroue. I'd probably grab a Maudite instead."
"Overall, this is a great interpretation of strong belgain ale. Unibroue makes a number of excellent ales, and this is one of them."
"Drinkability - Not bad but this spicy stuff is not for me."
"Tremendously drinkable for a 9% ABV beer. Well controlled alcohol as expected for a dark belgian, no syrupy sweet, nothing crazy about it. Just nice."
"A beautiful sipping beer that goes well with chocolate and I could imagine it going well with a nice wildberry compote."
"I haven't had alot of Unibroue brews, but this one is the best I have had. Its got a great dark fruit flavor and is very crisp and bubbly. 'I want to go to there' Liz from 30 Rock."
"This is like an expensive, very fine cigar. You don't chain smoke these things. Besides, you'd drop after a few. An exquisite brew."
"This has become my favorite Unibroue beer along with 17 and La Fin Du Monde"
"Pours a muddy/murky brown with a nice looking tan head. Smell is sweet, with brown sugar dominating. The taste is great, with more brown sugar and plums. Not as much of a raisin flavor as other Belgian Strong Ales and I like this one better because of it. Drinkability is pretty damn good for a 9.00% Belgian Strong Dark Ale. I hadn't stopped wanting more even after finishing off the 750mL bottle."
"Pours from the bottle a deep brown with about half an inch of head that quickly boils away. Interestingly, I smell and taste the orange peel and coriander flavors I'd expect from a wit. Also present in both the aroma and taste are cherry and whiskey notes, with a bready flavor also in the taste. The spiciness in the taste and finish is strong and leaves my stomach a bit unsettled. Mouthfeel is quite carbonated, but on par for the style, and this is a pretty heavy hitter where the ABV is concerned. I enjoyed this bottle, but I think I'll save my Unibroue dollars for La Fin Du Monde in the future."
"Legendary beer!"
"M-D- Smooth enough mouthfeel for 9% alcohol and sticks to the tongue with massive estery alcohol notes. Nice change in flavor. Will drink again!"
"Really a nice beer from Unibroue (shocker). Their production is world class and this is certainly one of the better ones - my only complaint is the carbonation."
"D - Very drinkable though with the amount of spice and the high alcohol, I can't see being able to drink more then a couple."
"Mouthfeel is full and has plenty of carbonation. Drinkability is pretty awesome considering the 9% ABV and the heaviness that I usually associate with the style. This one definitely goes to the top of the list along with my Chimay Blue."
"Overall- another pleasing beer by Unibroue. Well-crafted strong ale."
"A delicious Belgian-style dark ale and another solid offering from Unibroue. The flavors are complex and yet not too in-your-face which I have heard is one issue new beer enthusiasts have with many Belgian strong ales. I would like to have this beer again, and I would also like to seek out other strong dark ales to see how the flavors compare, but this is a good first experience."
"D - Easily drinkable despite its foreboding packaging and color. Totally awesome!"
"It's a bit syrupy, and the ABV is quite high, so it's not exceptionally drinkable, but the prominence of the dark fruits (though, in my beer, they're not really my thing) make this warrant at least one try."
"Overall a very good version of the style, worth seeking out if you haven't had it, and worth having again if you have."
"Keeps you coming back for more. A very nice offering form Unibroue and quite a value as this can reasonably be compared to Chimay Blue. I will try to make sure this is always on hand."
"Drinkability: perfect, can drink this all day, a classic"
"D - A pretty good beer. I've had better examples of the style, but it's fairly drinkable."
"Great nose, chocolatey truffles and vanilla with some black fruits in the background. A fine, smooth drink with some nice liqourice and spice coming out with that Belgian yeast. Was lucky enough to enjoy this with some Belgian chocolates. Very tasty. Cannot believe this is 9%.These guys don't seem to be getting much competition in the ""best Belgian beer outside Belgium"" category."
"Drinkability: excellent for such high abv beer."
"The taste is very refreshing, quite light, not at all syrupy, very sweet. The beer has some caramels, some clove flavors, orange rind, some other vague florals. Boy, this is very smooth, with just a touch of the yeasty Belgian-esque prickliness underneath and the efforvescence to keep this more of a sipping type beer, but not by much. There is some hop presence, a slight brown sugar sweetness, with a dash of spices in the cardoman family. I'm enjoying this beer with each sip. This is truly an excellent option from the best brewery to our North."
"the best thing is, this gets smoother as it warms. seriously classy beer, well made and it shows. a pleasure to drink."
"Yet another treat from the October case... a fragrant yeast grabs the nostrils with that Belgian crispness distinctive to Unibroue... thick, dark body with an equally thick yet diminishing off-white head--substantial and worthy of its label... a mellow, even body--quite surprising--with a soft, retreating aftertaste that makes the drink that much more enjoyable.... a pleasant, refreshingly light mix of Belgian hops and something darker that makes this a perfect after dinner desertif. Something sweetly mingles with the beerish properties to bless Trois Pistoles with a light yet filling end. And where is the 9% alcohol? Perfectly placed somewhere, I believe...I could use the word ""perfect"" a few more times, but one gets the picture..."
"M/D: Full bodied, carbonation is just right. Drinability is exceptional. I could really drink this beer one after another. A very good example of the style."
"Drinkability: Very nice, moderately high. I'm expecting the ABV to play into this though as I continue to drink it down. This is a tremendously enjoyable beer and great for a long night of sipping -- not sure if anyone would dare call that a session, but something that I am preferring to take my time with."
"Overall, this was a very solid, and flavorful, Belgian Strong Dark Ale."
"Taste is all there - a little leathery fruit, the big black caramel malts, the belgian yeasts...bomb diggity."
"D: According to everyone else tasting with me, this is a highly drinkable beer. In fact, we ran out of it almost immediately. That said, the alcohol was noticeable, and the lack of sweetness may turn off some."
"Overall: There are a lot of similarities here to most of the other Unibroue beers I've had. As someone who just can't get past the yeast in these beers, I'll say that this is not my favorite. That is not to say this is not enjoyable because I liked the entire bottle. I dig the fact that this one is dry and the flavors are still able to shine through, but I probably won't be knocking anyone over to get to this beer again."
"Overall - Unibroue continues to impress with their brews. Trois Pistoles is a well rounded Belgian Strong Dark. Excellent!"
"Pours black with a very thin head. Smells yeasty and spicy. It had a rather unique flavor. The belgian yeasts and coriander spice with an alcohol warmth and black licorice flavor. Also thought I tasted some fruity/peachy flavors. There is a strong alcohol flavor when you first start sipping this. It settles down as you drink and gives way to a more fruity flavors."
"smell is pretty boozey but has a yeasty sweet bite in the nose."
"Nice beer, I am liking this brewery more and more as time goes on."
"Notes: Yet another great Unibroue beer & highly recommended! I was apprehensive because the label compared it to a Port wine because I'm not a huge fan of wine but I was delightfully surprised. Great stuff."
"Overall, its very good and complex... I'm very happy with this one. Nicely balanced. I would recommend this one for a try."
"D: Very drinkable, especially for style. ABV very well hidden. A widely available, excellent beer. I let this one cellar for a while, will be interesting to compare with a younger version."
"This one has become my daily staple (hey, I'm getting my vitamin B fix) - and I always have some on hand nowadays. I do try to limit myself to one per session - that high ABV will sneak up on you something fierce. My favourite brew from one of my favourite breweries. Merci, Chambly!"
"A nice brew from Uni. One that I would drink again but I doubt I seek it."
"Another nice 'un from Unibroue. This dark ale on lees poured a dark brown to near black with a fluffy beige 2 finger head. Full of tiny bubbles rapidly pushing to the head saw it diminish to 1/2 finger and lace was medium in clinging. You could actually hear the fizz as these bubbles churned up, although in tasting, they did not seem present & definitely did not detract. The mouthfeel was smooth with a bitter plum skin flavor, with black coffee & hints of pear-banana-& lemon towards the end. Very interesting, to say the least! Slightly sour with enough bitter & sweet malts, it hinted at red wine-lambic in some respects. The 9% alcohol is not overwhelmingl, but definitely is warming. Very nice indeed!"
"Drinkability = Yeah .. this is probably meant to be sipped, but I love taking big gulps and letting the beer rest in my mouth while I absorb all the complex flavors."
"well, this is an unbelieveable specimen. do all belgian dark ales carry this amount of sweetness and flavor? I don't know but I am going to check. great, spectacular drink."
"D- Its another solid Unibroue beer. Although I'm feeling that most of them other than La Fin taste pretty much the same."
"I received two bombers of this beer in an alcohol exchange at Christmas. Poured a dark brown color in the glass with two finger head. Very spicy aroma with a hint of alcohol at the end. At the first sip the high carbonation is noticeable but not unpleasant. The taste is phenomenal. Very full flavored without being overpowering. Spicy hops with smooth malt finish. No alcohol aftertaste despite 9% ABV. Excellent beer all around."
"Dark amber with a thin tan head, but has decent retention. Not much lacing. Smells of cloves, malty, with some blending of citrus, raspberry and a little vanilla in the background. The taste is heavy on the malt, the fruit comes through well and mingles well with the cloves. Lighter than expected, a little estery and some butter keeping things mellow and smooth. Easy to drink, and that can be dangerous with the high ABV, but it's just hard to resist. Probably my favorite Canadian beer."
"D: Totally, I first got this on tap, and wasn't overly impressed, but the second opinion proves that this is a beer that will last. Quite Delicious."
"D - The sweetness is a little heavy but this is quite a beer. Not sure if I would drink more than one though."
"Mouthfeel is full bodied and medium-high carbonation. Not over the top like some I've tried. Nicely done for a Belgian style. I could certainly have another or enjoy a 750ml over a long relaxing evening. It only gets better over time."
"Another excellent brew from Unibroue - very interesting beer. Reminds me of a fine wine..."
"Nine percent? You wouldn't know it from the way this stuff goes down. Like all of the Unibroue beers I've had, Trois Pistoles is immensely drinkable. I would give it a 4.5 if it wasn't for the abv. The price and overall quality of the brew is top notch. Why must the French Canadians be so good at brewing beer?"
"The feel is smooth and buttery but a little thick. Not at all gritty. Milky but smooth. It's like a sour, ripe barleywine or strong ale. Tremendous to nurse for a long time. Great."
"Overall, a pretty good Belgian Strong Dark Ale. Although the taste isn't what I wanted it to be, it is still intriguing in it's own way. I enjoyed this, just not one of my favorites."
"Overall it's a great beer and a very good dark ale. So far I've liked everything I've tried from Unibroue."
"Dark berry flavors just like the smell. Almost like a black licorice. More carbonation than average and a thinner mouthfeel. Nice beer that I shouldn't pass up."
"d - thanks a lot, Unibroue. Just when I think Don De Dieu is my favorite I try this one. Now it's a toss-up. Highly drinkable at 9% ABV. A treat I will be sure to stock up on."
"Excellent offering by Unibroue."
"This is a best value for those who like the style of Dark Belgians. Very dark in color and highly carbonated, this brew has a unique fruity taste that is hard to describe. Easily drinkable and packs a punch, ABV is well hidden. One of my favorites from Unibroue. Definitely deserves a try."
"This is another well crafted beer from our friends at Unibroue; made to mirror the Belgian Trappist style"
"Very good brew."
"Blackish purple vacuum under a light beige head. Bottle exploded upon opening and poured an erupting volcano head that retains after. Aromas of blueberry, elderberry, strawberry, with a hint of dark chocolate. Powerful driving carbonation propelling an explosion of tart, fruity flavors tied together by tangy, bitter chocolate. Aggressive and brightfully complex. Crisp carbonation stings the palate, washing away the zest to usher in dry, cocoa, coffee, and rasberry. Excellent balance. An eloquent, explosive dessert."
"Pours an opaque plum color with enlivened off-white head. Strong scent of ripe dark fruit, grapes, plums, syrup. Light crisp in taste with notes of fresh plums, grapes, spices, slight alcoholic booze in the center that gets washed away by medicinal fruit tang. Very much like a good wine. Light oil on mouthfeel that slicks the tongue. Alcohol takes a back seat to the fruit while spice rides shotgun; a mystical potion of a brew."
"Another gem from Unibroue!"
"D - alcohol is hidden well and the beer is delicious, you want to drink it fast, but you must go easy with the ABV"
"Overall this is a great brew! Would definitely get this one again. Highly enjoyable."
"Overall I liked this beer, though it was very filling. Not sure I could have a lot here, but enjoyed this one."
"Brown/amber pour, large lasting whitish head. Sweet aromas, some malt, yeast. Suprising amount of red fruit with caramel/toffee. Has a stick to it, but rather medium bodied. Quite a bit of carbonation, but it does not get in the way. Does improve as it warms. Not quite sure what to make of the Unibroue brews, it's like they're all the same beer with different flavorings added. Good but not great. This is my favorite however."
"D: This got better for me as I drank it. Right out of the gate, I found it to be pretty bland for a Belgian Strong Dark. Thankfully, it got more complex as I continued to drink it. The lack of much head and the watery mouthfeel makes me think that perhaps my bottle had a leaky cork. I might visit this again to see if I got a bad sample."
"Solid one finger head, active turnover of micro-bubbles, light brown in color, rapidly slides off the glass sides. Dark brown mahogany color with zinc orange accents. The nose is an avalanche of ginger, cumin, clove spice, spiced orange peel, caramelized brown sugar and attractive floral musk, as it normalizes in your nostrils the cherry, black raspberry scents come through, not anything here of note by way of hops. Medium-bodied, big foaminess which initially has your mouth as full as if an car safety airbag was activated in it. After that it becomes super-smooth and fluid, glides through the mouth. Huge inner mouth perfume of ginger, clove spice, swirls around unveiling orange peel, pine needles and chocolate covered raisins. The yeasty notes are like honey braised phyllo dough."
"M/D - decent carbonation, a good smooth beer, but there was something about the flavor that makes it not a completely pleasant experience. It was a good flavor, but maybe just a little too strong for me."
"I'll definitely look to buy this again but I still feel it has a way to go to be at the table with it's Belgium brothers."
"Trois Pistoles is one of my favorite strong beers. It reminds me of caramel, grapes, figs, with malt thrown in for good measure. Has some hop character but doesn't beat you over the head with it. Has a nice brown appearance decanted. Smells wonderful with a a bakery appearance in the smell. Smells like Banana nut bread with some malty notes. Tastes like caramel, figs, bread, hops, and a smooth finish. This beer's alcohol content is very deceptive as it is so mellow. It's easy to drink for a high ABV beer and demands slow sipping to appreciate it's qualities. It grows on you in a quiet way. Subtle and powerful, feline in quality. Mellow and relaxing on the other hand. Complex and rich and better with experience. One of the finest ales extant."
"This was a wonderful beer that stays crisp and carbonated throughout the whole drink and doesn't reveal the alcohol it contains, very drinkable!....also I was lucky enough to get this in a 4-pack for $3.99!!! at Primo Cigars, Wine and Spirits in Woodbury, MN...the store should be listed here on BA soon!"
"My only dissapointment was finding out it was made in montreal. Me being a die hard bruins fan, I was not amused...Great beer though!"
"Drinkability: A thoroughly enjoyable brew, and one that must be savored over a long period of time. I don't know if it's one I would buy on a regular basis, but I'd definitely have it again."
"It is a shame to do any thing but sip (savor!) this one. It goes down fine with a little warming in the end. I have come back to this one again and again (and will repeat in the future)."
"D: A good tasting beer, I couldn't spend an evening with it but nice for a conversation. The warmth becomes more present after the first glass. Body is nice, but not great, flavor is very good, but something needs to tie the flavors together better..."
"D- At 9% two and through for me. This really doesen't warrant excessive amounts as the flavors are just not all together and integreated. The alcohol is also not masked too well. This is nice enough though to keep in the cellar from time to time."
"DRINKABILITY- CANT BE BEAT FOR 9 PERCENT TRY IT NOW!"
"D: Not the most drinkable and not its greatest aspect. A little heavy sitting but still a pleasure to sip on. Not something I reach for a second bottle of if I had it but something that I will lean on more often moving forward."
"Don't misinterpret my review, I thought this beer to be pretty enjoyable. The alcohol was almost unnoticeable and it has a spiciness that intrigues your tastebuds. A complex experience."
"Thanks to Don H. for this bottle."
"Pours a cloudy, very dark mahogany with a light brown head. Smells of rich, dark fruits, sweet and tropical fruits, spices, and yeast. Taste is out of this world. Complex, dynamic interplay of dark fruits, Bazooka bubblegum, cloves, there's a LOT going on and it is all delicious. Medium body is packed with lively carbonation that lifts the liquid immediately off the tongue and fills the mouth. This beer is nothing if not a treasure."
"Delicious."
"From notes 1/5/09"
"A rather enjoyable version of a BSDA, as there isn't any overly obvious astringency from the 9% ABV, which makes for surprisingly good (if slow and steady) drinkability. A pretty decent selection for the beverage component of the beer and pizza remuneration for an afternoon of helping friends move, I'd say."
"The mouth is somewhat overpowering. Quite crisp, watery and overcarbonated. The aftertaste is of grapes. Lacks the silky smooth characteristic I look for in a Belgian Dark."
"not impressed. the beer pours dark brown, almost black, with a white head. smells of all different sorts of sweetness, but mostly black licorice. the taste is of malt, licorice, and the beligian yeast that haunts me so. ill admit that it is fairly complex, but this is not in a good way. it is overly carbonated, and has little drinkability."
"D--Not much to say. It goes down so easy that I am not sure exactly where mine went to. It appears to have disappeared."
"This beer poured the color of rich earth with a tight, caramel colored, well bubbled head that dissipated quickly. The aromas of licorice, and malt promised that the best was yet to come. On the palate it's vigorous carbonation was followed by a thick and smooth and creamy feel with a rich, roasted malt taste and a fruity finish. Certainly, the commercial description of a Port wine and ripe fruit is completely accurate. The complexity of this beer made every sip an adventure."
"I expected great things from this brew after loving La Fin du Monde and Maudite, and was a bit let down. It doesn't offer the complexity I was looking for or the bold aromas and tastes that I've come to love from Unibroue. A good beer overall, but far from Unibroue's best."
"Overall, this is a solid beer. It is extremely easy to drink and the 9% abv is masked pretty well. I could definitely handle another, but that would probably be it. I highly recommend this beer."
"Drinkability- This beer gets better the longer you sip it. It seems to balance itself out after it sits for 15-20 minutes. It is well-balanced to begin with, but really takes it up a notch as time passes. I grabbed this after a friend of mine got an assortment pack and broke the lone Trois. Good price on the 4 pack, so I went for it. I promised him he could have one, looks like I might have to ""break"" one too!!"
"This one is a keeper!"
"The mouthfeel is medium to thin bodied with a sharp carbonation. Good drinkability all around."
"Drinkability: I'd been putting this one off far too long, and it was a pleasure to finally try it, even if it wasn't under the best of circumstances (I only picked it because it was directly in front of me, so I knew they had it in stock). Pretty much a classic Belgian dark, and though nothing here took me by surprise, I didn't want nor expect it to. I'm glad 750s of this are only $6.99 at Beer Run here in town."
"d : I would be able to drink a couple of these, but due to the high ABV it is not a good session beer. It however is not so heavy that it would be a bad beer to drink on a hot day (I know)."
"Pours a very dark red with a slight off white head. Head has very little retention, but does develop a decent collar and a slight laciness. Very fruity aroma, reminds me of a wine, a lot of belgain sugars. Taste is very fruity, but sharp, and complex. Also a lot of belgain sugars in the taste. Light and thin texture, but beer sits very heavy. Overall this beer has good flavor and is enjoyable. A little on the sweet side and is high in alcohol."
"Drinkability: I think I initially poured this one a little too cold, as the flavor and mouthfeel both improved significantly as the drink warmed. All in all, a very flavorful and full bodied example of the style."
"Mouthfeel full bodied, peppery, yeasty, spritzy up front, with creamy, sugary, alcohol finish."
"D-Well, this is a tasty beer. It's a bit different than many of the Belgian brews that I've encountered, but I did enjoy it. The flavor profile was complex, making it very nice."
"Overall - I don't even know what to say. This is such an immensely good beer that I just want to sit back and enjoy it. Great after dinner! Well worth the money. I have a few of these aging right now :)"
"This is a drinkable beer. Very sweet, very rich, and goes well with bleu cheese."
"Robust and complex in flavor and nose. Strong alcohol taste and dry finish. This is not for everybody, but definitely something to sit and sip. The nose plays a big part in this experience. If you like a strong Belgian (there's a joke there somewhere), this is definitely worth a try. Overall, solid quaff."
"Date consumed: 22 September 2008"
"D: This one drinks pretty easily despite the complexity, and has some delicious flavors at work. My first from Unibroue, and I'll definitely be checking some of their other offerings out in the near future."
"I'm not really sure if the bottle was labeled correctly. Some of the other reviews could be similar to mine, but I would have areally hard time describing this beer as a strong dark ale. It was much more light and fruity. The beer had a strong yeast flavor and some hoppy fruitness that was very sour and citrusy in nature. I don't really like those flavors in my beer, so that's why I gave the beer a generally poor review. It wasn't awful, and I should say it had a really unique flavor. I will give it another try, but this time it wasn't that favorable in my mouth."
"If you have the means- I highly reccomend it."
"D: Smooth, very well refined, with a great drinkability."
"Scott"
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, strong kick, good representation of style, there are certain things that I've come to expect from Unibroue and at the same time I've come to know that they can throw a curve-ball once in a while. This beer has the Unibroue qualities I expected and also has the curve-ball with its fruity and candy-like taste. Overall, it's a well-made beer that is worth drinking for a long time if you're in the mood for this type of beer, but it's not one that I would want to drink consistently."
"I have to edit this review with one remark after the fact, as I tried Trois Pistoles from the smaller (regular-size, not 750ml) bottles a couple of days ago and it seemed to not be as good... I don't know why. Something about it tasted harsher. I would suggest being wary of this!"
" I have yet to run into a beer from Unibroue that I haven't deeply enjoyed. This one has been added to a list that could be entitled, ""I like it a lot, but not enough to search for it and pay the arm and a leg being asked""."
"D - Highly. I will now pick up more of this. Very high in my books. Reminds me of a fantastic apple, pear beer with hints of raisins and prunes. Exceptional."
"Overall the drinkabaility is fine. It came off as a bargain version of true Belgian dark ales but it was priced as such as well so I can't complain too much. It still beats your generic macros by a mile."
"Note: Pairs well with blue and gargonzola cheeses and crackers"
"This is one of my first craft beers which I am revisiting and will do so again. A very enjoyable beer for after a large meal consisting of red meat."
"I mean, give me a friggin' break. Pick 5 out of 11, and maybe we'll have a clue."
"12oz bottle. Dark, good head height - no head retention (bigger, darker bubbles and - oops! - gone!). Smells sweet and earthy - a bit of the mold from a dry blue cheese, you know? Bitter, dry chocolate (no sweetness to that). Some brown sugar taste without the sweetness. Fizzy in the mouth. I won't be seeking this one out again."
"overall very very good, but best shared. the opposite of a session beer. although i've had this beer many times, it always surprises and delights."
"mouthfeel is bitter, sweet, fruity, dry yeastly/residual alcohol/ almost tannic lingering aftertaste, great carbonation, a great sipper, can't believe this was one of the first craft beers i'd tried a few years ago and haven't revisited since!"
"amen"
"D: I would definitely have this again. The food I was eating it with (something quite creamy) was probably not the best choice, but something tells me this beer would go very well with some kind of food..."
"I enjoy Unibroue's beers, and this beer is certainly shares strengths with the rest of Unibroue's line. A great beer, especially remarkable for its ability to hide its 9%."
"Drinkability- Unibroue likens this beer to an aged port; and not for nothing. Like a good port, however, this is something to be enjoyed sparingly; you wouldn't want two glasses in the same night, probably not even in the same week,; but you will look forward to having it again, eventually, because it is very delicious."
"(rated Jan 22, 2007)"
"Poured this crude oil black colored beer into a pint glass. It came off with a nice amount of head and lacing after it settled. The smell of fruits greets the nose and makes a pleasant aroma of yeast and raisons. The taste follows suit of the aroma. Overall a great beer to enjoy."
"This is deffinaly a sipper at 9% but oh boy does this baby have some well balanced and complex flavors. ***tip*** let her warm up"
"A nice brew but being one of my favorite styles their are others out their that I prefer."
"D: The spicing, carbonation, and alcohol cause this one to be a bit of a sipper for me. However, many in the style have that same characteristic."
"Wow, didn't expect it to be rated so high. Pours dark brown with a huge tan head. Aroma is full of malt and dark fruits. Lots of raisins and some apple. Taste was kind of thin. Almost nothing up front, then a burst of alcohol, sugar, spice, and grapes. As soon as these flavors appear, they disappear in the back. The aftertaste is nice and smooth, with malts and the port they advertised. I let it warm, and it was nearly the same. I just got tired of trying to appreciate this beer."
"Tastes of ripe plum and dark chocolate covered cherries. Somewhat sweet but not overly so, a well balanced malt structure. Carbonation is a bit high thus shortening the finish of the beer, though the feel and finish do improve with a bit of warming and outgassing of the carbonation, thus yielding a slightly chewy malt finish. Decent drinkability for the style as the carbonation masks the sugar and alcohol reasonably well."
"It's bubbly and feels light in my mouth, perfect for a Belgian, this 750ml will be easy drinking... I'm glad its Sunday."
"Drinkability: Outstandingly drinkable for the abv, you can only feel it after the cumulative warming in the stomach."
"Overall: Great beer, probably my favorite from Unibroue so far. For 9% ABV, the alcohol is very well hidden and it drinks with ease, so watch out. Could have a few of these... in fact I already have!"
"Another good, but not stellar, beer from Unibroue. From all the publicity this brewery gets I've almost been disappointed from them so far.. this is my 4th offering from them and nothing has really stood out. The positive thing about this one is how good it masks the alcohol... it's barely detectable but really knocks you back with the 9% ABV. Pours a cloudy brownish color with minimal head and a little bit of lacing down the glass. Smells of dark fruits and has a very spicy taste to it. Enjoyed it, but thought it could be better."
"Taste: Flavor is also a lot like Maudite except that the alcohol is more hidden. Apples/pears, and some cloves as well."
"I'm a big fan of the Unibroue offerings. Unfortunnatley for this beer, the distinguishing characteristic in my opinion is its a little watered down. The flavors are more subtle than what I'd prefer. Still a very good beer, though."
"This one poured a nice dark color with a light tan head and left beautiful lacing over the glass as the 1 finger head dissipated. The aroma was estery with some dark fruits- dates and cherries come to mind. This one didn't do too much for me overall- I can see the appeal but I wasn't getting too much in the taste other than a hefty mouthfeel with some molasses-like sweetness and dark fruits. This is a pretty heavy beer- both in ABV and in mouthfeel, I dont think I could tackle more than a 2 in a night. I might have to try it again down the road though."
"Pours a dark brown body, almost black, with a small light brown head that is diminishing. Has an aroma of hops, some sweetness, molasses, and citrus. A taste of molasses, heavy body, slight coffee, plum. Tasty."
"Notes: This is a damn tasty brew! Mellow, rich, very complex, and extremely pleasant with a good alcohol punch as well. Looks good, smells great, and tastes even better. What a treat for the senses. Highly recommended!"
"My first hack at the Unibroue line. I'm pleasantly surprised. The taste of this Belgian style is just as good as its aroma, which is nothing short of amazing. I'm excited to try La Fin Du Monde and Maudite."
"Very nice beer. I consider my self an amateur of the style, but this one is damn solid."
"D: Balanced, easy to drink, not overly cloying."
"I enjoyed Trois Pistoles however; I prefer La Fin Du Monde or Don De Dieu - can't wait to try Maudite for a better style comparison. This Belgian Strong Dark Ale is another fine offering from one of the better brewers."
"D - One hell of a beer that continues to impress and is consumed, only wanting more of it"
"D- as with all unibroue beers, this one is easy to drink. the 750 was shared with my wife and i was left wanting more. for something this available and cheap, its one hell of a beer. i feel this beer/brewery is pretty under rated because theyre so easy to get and usually overlooked on the shelves. check this one out if you like the style and havnt had it yet/"
"An all-time favorite that deserves a blind tasting vs. Chimay Grande Réserve, Brasserie Des Rocs Triple Impériale, N'Ice Chouffe and Gulden Draak."
"d - this is a fantastic beer, a 4 pack makes you feel warm and fuzzy, and is a bargain for the quality you get."
"Pours a dark brown color with garnet hues and a thin off white head with the lacing falling back to the head. Aromas of vanilla, sweet malt and dark fruits- raisin, prunes, figs. Same flavors as the armoas, with some alcohol warmth. High carboation, full body this is a very smooth drinking beer. The flavors all come together very nicely with each taking a turn as the lead."
"would love to try this one on tap i have yet to have a beer from Unibroue i didnt like. i suggest everyone try this one it is very close to the belgian style it says it is"
"This beer improves greatly upon warming. Though I started with it out of the fridge, everything really blossomed when it hit about 10-15 degrees below room temperature."
"D - Pretty good stuff but over carbonated in my opinion."
"D - too heavy to be very drinkable but the high alcohol is not seen"
"Unibroues best beer! Maybe the only one which didn't dissapoint me though..."
"Drinkability- A homer, this beer is lovely on all fronts."
"This beer has a nice creamy mouthfeel and decent drinkability. Another great beer from Unibroue that's a bit overshadowed by some of their other offerings."
"one of my favorites from the brewery. they really did a great job on this one. quite dark with medium head, latte foam color. not too tight of bubble though. still has great density overall. smell is of a subtle dubbel, not as cane sugar. some brown sugar, plum, blueberry. taste is a deep dark fruit ester, some banana and walnut malt too. smooth without a track of any alcohol. really something. extremely easy to drink too. would go well with just about anything to eat as well."
"D: Very drinkable brew, Unibroue continues to impress. High ABV not apparent."
"Notes: Does anyone else think like I do that this beer, while great, is a lot like Gulden Draak?"
"This beer captured the essence of a Belgian Dark ale without the flavor weight of a stout."
"D- This will kick your ass if you have more than 3 in sitting. Easy to throw back though but it fills you up."
"D: This is a pretty damned good brew. Unibroue has made some pretty solid beers in my opinion and this is one of them. Very nice and easy to drink. This is a very good looking brew to look at even when served in a Mason jar. All other categories are solid and this brew proves to be an enjoyable experience."
"D: Good but too sweet to be considered better."
"M/D - Medium bodied, highly carbonated. Bubbles dance on the tongue. Sweet and bready makes it easy to drink and hard to put down."
"3.5/4/4/3/3.5"
"D: This is a great way to end a fun weekend, I'm enjoying this and will revisit"
"A: Cola brown, frothy head which dropped quickly and became a wafer thin layer of creamy carbonation - 4.25, S: Spicy aromas, what I perceive to be orange peel and lemon zest, Belgian yeast is obvious - 4.50, T: High alcohol is evident, sharp tang, sugared dates, some subtle golden raisin - 4.00, M: Quite dry - 4.50, D: Unibroue continues to impress me, a solid interpretation of the style, quite flavorful and one that I'd go back to - 4.00"
"With its high alcohol percentage, it's not a quaffer, but it's quite sippable over an evening. Wonderful, complex brew."
"D: Considering its high ABV, the drinkability is very easy...thoroughly enjoyed it."
"Pours a very dark brown with a 1/4"" of light tan head that quickly dissipates. Aroma is quite nice although subdued, malts, fruity esters and some light phenols. Taste is like the aroma. There is a distinct caramel maltyness the supports the other flavors (and aromas). The esters are mostly of darker fruit, think dark cherries, etc. but there is also a touch of green apple that actually melded well with the other flavors here. The very light phenolic spicyness in the aroma is a bit more amplified in the flavor. There is a distinct alcohol presence in the flavor that I initially did not find in the aroma. However as I sip this brew I begin to detect some perfumes from the alcohol that are quite pleasant. I was looking for a bit more in the way of the esters here but this ""style"" is open to considerable interpretation. Mouthfeel is pretty good, maybe a bit too heavy (I prefer more highly attenuated trappist versions) with medium+ body and moderate carbonation. Drinkability is pretty darn good. This really wasn't quite what I was expecting (it seemed to lack some complexity) but I really enjoyed it none the less."
"Not a bad beer at all, but this one is hard for me to place. Maybe I'm stuffed up too much right now or something, but I'm not catching all the flavor I know should be there."
"And there you have it."
"You know it when you have a Unibroue. There is a distinctness to their wares, much like the distinctness to a Dogfish or a Flying Dog. You just know it's one of theirs. For Unibroue, it's the aroma. Especially with Trois Pistoles, it packs a punch that reels back and hits you in the nose. To describe it as a bouquet doesn't do it justice. Spice and fruit and floral and citrus and sugars all wrapped up in one, and that's just the aroma. The taste doesn't disappoint either. Dark and rich with fruits and roasted malts, a slight burnt molasses undertone. 9% ABV but no burn at all. I'd say this is the closest to a North American St. Bernardus as one can get."
"Future outlook: I can't wait to get my hands on another bottle of this."
"d - I would have another but not too many - boy it's powerful on flavor, taste, and booze."
"d: Another great one from Unibroue. Careful, your head will warn you of the high ABV before your tongue does."
"Notes: Will likely try a different service glass next time, likely oversized wine glass, as I have a few more from a four pack. In general a nice strong dark, but I prefer the Maudite from Unibroue. Though a nice twist, and one I would certain give a thumbs up to per recommendation."
"[Mouth] Nice sweet malt characters, excelent body and good and gentile carbonation. This beer has one of the best after flavour that I´ve tryed. wuauuu!"
"Sweet and has a relatively high abv. A sipper, but a pretty easy one at that."
"D: One of my favorite after-dinner sipping beers. This and La Fin Du Monde are my favorite regular Unibroue offerings."
"It pours brown, with a kind of thin head. It has this very deep, sweet smell, somewhere between roasted barley and sweet malts mixed with a hint of fruit. I really loved the taste. There is a bit of the typical sweetness of strong Belgian ales, but the darker malts help to subdue it so that it's not cloying. I found myself wanting to taste more and more, but I'm not so sure that I could drink more than one or two. I'll definitely try this again when I'm in the mood."
"Pours a dark brown with dark amber hues when held to light. Nice creamy, light brown head that retains very well. Little lacing. Smells of belgian yeast and spices, clove, ripened dark fruits, amaretto, slight alcohol fumes. Taste is huge sweet malts intertwined with the belgian yeast flare, spices ala clove, coriander, hints of caramel, those bright red dessert cherries whose name eludes me at the moment, and an alcohol bite/warming in the finish that is more noticeable on the first sip but blends in a bit more with each sip, leaving only the warming sensation in the chest. Plenty of carbonation of tiny bubbles that prick the tongue, medium bodied, wet. Very enjoyable but one is definitely enough for me."
"The mouthfeel is a little light and fizzy. I think this one is a bit overcarbonated. Perhaps I should have aged this one a year or two. It would have been good until 2011 - or so it says on the bottle. Overall this beer is tasty, refreshing, and it hides the alcohol nicely."
"Clean taste upfrount with a dry dusty spiceyness,tart with subtle dark fruitiness and hints of green apple,just a hint of yeast. The 9% alc. is almost non-exsistant,could be dangerous. Has a nice light peppery mouthfeel,very smooth and drinkable. Amazing just can't belive this beer is 9%. Very light mouthfeel,airy,goes down almost too easy.I'd love to try this one on draft if possible. Must try beer in my book with definatly drink this one again."
"Not bad at all. As always, I love their artwork; but the beer itself is probably the best thing I've had from Unibroue."
"I was really happy with this beer and would definately get it again and recomend it to people."
"Drinkability: Flavor is really pleasant, but I don't think I would last long drinking these pups. ABV is high and hits you quick. Other than that, a really solid beer. Way to go Unibroue (once again)!"
"This is a dangerously drinkable beer, considering its 9% alcohol content. Exceptionally drinkable, you don't even sense the extra alcohol. Watch out!"
"This company has continued to impress me with their Belgian style beers. I also like the artwork on the bottle and unique names."
"D: I found this to be very drinkable. It's sweet, but not overly so. The fruit flavor to me sticks out the most, but it's not overdone like in some beers I've tried. Definitely worth a try, I wouldn't complain if I had a chance to drink more of this."
"Had the unique pleasure of sampling this on tap at American Flatbread. Poured a deep and ominous maple color with a fluffy tan head of tiny bubbles. Soft aroma of figs and the so called 'horse blanket' mustiness. Bold flavors of dates, raisins and figs, rich malt in the middle, currants, hints of ginger and some alcohol esters. Very complex and layered . The high ALC% is well concealed by the sugars and the slap-you-around flavors. Light to medium carbonation and a rich mouthfeel. Lots going on with this one and quite challenging without being unpleasant. A great example of the style (Belgian Dark) and yet another reason Unibroue is one of the best breweries on planet earth."
"D: Exceptionally drinkable, especially given it's 9% price tag"
"It is very possible that this brewery from Quebec is becoming my all time favorite. This delicious brew makes for a 3/3 tally in favor of Unibroue. Will be making it a top priority to finish off what they have to offer in a reasonable timeframe."
"D - Very drinkable -- perhaps too drinkable -- at 9% ABV I could scarcely detect. Would be great with grilled meats."
"Mouthfeel is quite full. There's a relatively small carbonation presence, and the co2 zing is very mild."
"Pours a hazy dark brown color with a thick off-white head. Alcohol, yeast, dark fruit and sugary aroma. Slightly sweet tasting with vanilla yeast, some dark fruits and a roasted chocolate flavor with some caramel but not crazy over-powering like I was expecting and the alcohol seems to be hidden very well. Very good beer."
"I very complex beer, best enjoyed slow to savor all of the flavors."
"Medium bodied, smooth and sippable. Take your time and enjoy it the flavor develops as it starts to warm a bit. Very nice."
"The beer is poured with a dark brown and a fair amount of carbonation. The head retention isn't that great, but I wasn't really expecting much more. The nose on the beer really reminds me of a dark wheat beer mixed with the ale yeast and spices; it's very complex. The taste is filled with complexity, like this style is supposed to be. It's fruity, has the usual Belgian spice to it, and a nice roasted maltness that brings out the plum flavours. This is quite tasty. The mouthfeel is a bit thin. It's drinkable for a Belgian style beer."
"Pours black with a substantial fluffy off-white head. Heavy Aroma of raisins, plums, spices, roasted malt, and alchohol. Taste has bits of smokey apple pie and roasted coffee. Flavor gets more and more complex as it warms. Lively carbonation and mouthfeel. It can taste and feel a bit boozy but overall it's a nice treat."
""
"Drinkability is moderate. Flavor is ok, but alcohol is high. I'm pretty indifferent on this one."
"Drinkability: The best of the Unibroue beers."
"Not a session brew, but one to savor."
"Unibroue has not let me down yet, and consistently makes high quality Belgians. Highly recommended."
"Dark Red, opaque. Pours slowly. Smells.... Cherries, almost like a glass of red wine. Pours into my chalice with a good head initially, which dissipates quickly. Tastes fruity, with a sweet taste that lingers. Very smooth and drinkable. I found myself drinking most of a 75cl bottle without realizing it. Given I'm not personally fond of red-wines, I found this beer slightly less than amazing, but for what it aspires to be, those who are looking for this sweet, edged flavour will not be disappointed. The Alcohol is deceptive, in that it doesn't seem to hit you for an hour before it rears its head all at once. It's worth noting that this bottle wasn't cellared at all, but bought and consumed on the same day. I strongly suspect this beer would benefit strongly from cellaring."
"d: One of the best I've tried from these guys. Definitely on the list of beers to buy again."
"Very nice brew. Heavenly."
"Wow, what can I say to best sum up the overall experience of this remarkable brew. Got it in a 750 ml bottle (which I will be keeping for my home brew). Poured into a wine glass a very dark reddish purple with a big foamy head that soon diminished. I allowed this one to warm up a little before sampling. The aroma consisted of sweet fruits perhaps grapes, cherries, and maybe even plums. Finally it was time to try a taste and the flavors burst inside of my mouth. This dark ale is very unique in that it drinks like a beer, but finishes almost like a red wine. Good carbonation and rather smooth to drink, I enjoyed sipping on this for a good while. The strong alcohol content is masked by all of the complex flavors in this beer. Wonderful experience, not an everyday selection but worth the price for a long cold night."
"overall, i got this in a make-your-own-6'er that was $7.25 a very nice beer for a very nice price"
"high alcohol masked wonderfully by unibroue"
"Drinkability - Really sweet at first then gets better, would go great with a huge meal or with like... turkey. Or for the alcohol content, a perfect nightcap drink. Great beer, but, of course, not for a beer session. (one bottle of this is equal to 3 and 1/2 BudLights, haha)"
"Overall I would definitely recommend this beer, it has a very distinct flavor and for the price there's no reason not to give it a shot."
"Love it!"
"D - This is an excellent beer its pretty easy to drink and has a treat taste to it worth trying"
"D: Definitely more of a night cap beer. It is not something I would want to drink all night long, but the alcohol is extremely well masked, and the flavors are delicious. This is one beer that is really worth trying."
"Highly drinkable brew here. Nice, sweet, easy drinking. Unibroue does it again."
"The flavor starts out with a blast of sour, dark fruit, yeasty spice and sweetened booze before quickly mellowing to a bubbly, smooth vanilla note. Crisp mineral finish lingers effortlessly on the back of the palate with a fruity bitterness. The alcohol is a nice touch, complementing the flavors without heating the tongue. Mouthfeel starts out a bit overly carbonated, but give it time and Trois will mellow. Overall, a pleasing brew and one of the best that Unibroue makes. A classic that I will surely revisit."
"Smooth and medium-bodied with plenty of carbonation that didn't show well in the pour, but performs true to design on the drink."
"I have to try it again to be sure on my rating."
"A pretty darn good brew. I'm (somewhat kidding here) a bit tired of Unibroue being so consistently good - will they ever be able to release a beer that truly, utterly stands out?"
"D: Very strong and a sipper but definitely my favorite Unibroue beer. In my experience tastes great freshed or aged for a year or two."
"Overall, I thought it was quite good. It seems like it's hard to find anything bad from Unibroue. It's not top of the line, true Belgian, but it's also much cheaper. For what it is, it's damn good."
"D= This is one drinkable strong Belgian dark ale. Unibroue is reliable outstanding and this is no exception!"
"D: while it didn't have the complexity of a Trappist, this was a very easy and good drinker, although at this abv one has to be careful. An enjoyable experience all around. I happened to be eating a Chicago-style hot dog at the time, and while not expecting a good match, the beer was able to hold its own and not get crushed by the tangy condiments. With chocolate this would have been heaven."
"Drinkability: Very tasty. I'd been quite some time, years in fact, since I'd last had one of these. I oughta be ashamed of myself."
"750ml corked bottle served in a chalice. Poured a dark copper with lots of carbonation. Two fingers of off white head. Fruity with some spice in the aroma. Smooth, medium bodied beer with some malty sweetness and a little spice in the finish. Sometimes the Unibroue beers blend together with me. Nothing really jumps out at me, but I still enjoy them on a purely hedonistic level. Good value for your money."
"This beer is drinkable in a four pack. I would, could and have and will again drink this wondrously magic brew from the crazy canucks up above me. My favorite from these guys!"
"Pours a deep, dark mahogany, quite cloudy and a massive, big bubbled head that soon diminishes to a covering. Aroma is classic Unibroue, plentiful fruits: cherries, grapes, raisins followed by rich toasty malts, hints of chocolate, and spicy alcohol. On the palate, its richness is quite nice, it starts of big and bold malty, plenty of toasty malts and fruity esters. A mid palate sweetness finishes relatively dry given its high carbonation. Overall, a solid offering from Unibroue, one of my favorites and one I too often overlook at the store."
"Brought a couple of these over to a BBQ for me and one of my friends. I found out firsthand that the other partygoers had brought Budweiser, and would not stand for that. Looks like a ruby black, if that makes any sense. A pretty frothy head and a lot of bubbles along the side of the glass. Smells like dried fruit with hints of cocoa. Tastes like prunes, raisins, spices, not unlike port. A very effervescent mouthfeel. Not the most drinkable beer due to the higher ABV. These things pack a punch."
"Hm. I remember this as being a little better. Perhaps it's not the wonderful one-off of my memory. Check it out for yourself."
"D: My first exposure to this brewery. I'll be buying everything available from them. A great representation of the style, actually my favorite I've tried. A great balance of strength (alcohol), spice, fruits, and malt."
"I haven't tasted many Belgian Strong Dark Ales, so I wasn't sure what to expect. I was so impressed with Maudite that I could only expect a darker version to be even better. That's usually the case with English ales, so why not Belgians? What a letdown. This beer looks so good, dark brown with a rocky tan head that filled my glass and never fully receded. But that's where the fun ends. This doesn't smell like something I want to drink. It's not inviting or malty, more a sort of twisted fruitiness that I can only describe as ""rotten flowers"". The taste follows the smell - it's sharp and dry in a way that defies description. I was hoping for some imperial stout-like dark fruit or chocolate or something, and all I get is... I don't know. I can't describe the taste other than not my cup of tea. I'll stick with Maudite next time."
"Simply a wonderful brew."
"I tried this beer on January 17, 2008 at ""Smokeless Joe's"" in Toronto. I've been trying to get a hold of this for a while but it has been rather elusive. The beer poured a dark brown, with a thick creamy tan coloured head that lingered a few minutes. The aroma was sweet malt, some yeast, some dark fruit, and some spices. The mouthfeel was creamy, full-bodied, with high carbonation. The flavour was malty, sweet, yeasty...with a little licorice."
"D: Tasty and easy to drink. What more do ya need?"
"D- Definitely. Goes great with a meal. The alcohol is definitely there, but is rather hidden."
"A great beer that goes down smoothly."
"Poured a dark mahogany color with a quickly dissipating head. I was quickly hit with fruity esters which seemed to overwhelm a backdrop of maltiness. It has a sour aftertaste with no hop presence. Very crisp carbonation that settles nicely. For a dark ale it is not overpowered with malty sweetness but rather more subtle fruit essence. As the label says ""remarkably mellow""."
"Overall, this beer needs it's own category, I don't think I've tasted anything that comes close to it. In my opinion, Unibroue's best, not as in your face as the others, yet extremely complex. A dessert amongst beer!"
"I remember being blow away by this ale, it seems to have been ""melowed"" down from what i remember... a good dubbel, but not a extraordinary one like it used to be."
"Taste is a rich, hearty blend of slightly sweet and toasted malt, raisin and faint dried papaya with uplifting spicy yeasts that carry the ale though a smooth finish. Nice, medium body and the carbonation picks at the tongue and soft palate just like a nice champagne, leaving the same dry mouthfeel at the end. The body is lighter than other varieties of this style, but it marries up perfectly with the spice and flavor. This is a delicious, well-balanced beverage. There is also a veil of mineral presence that lingers in the aftertaste along with some faint hops that cleanse the palate just enough to make you want to take another draw. The light sweetness lingers on."
"Pours what could be black, but black doesn't quite describe this color. Black is for stouts...this is more of an extremely dark wood? It has an incredible, thick, fluffy, beige head that seems to be sticking around for a while. No webbing on this one; a solid layer of head sticks to the walls of the chalice. An immense cotton candy-like essence radiates outwards and is followed by malty, fruity, and spicy undertones. Surprisingly floral as well. The taste is complex beyond belief. It starts out sugary (candied sugar) and spicy (cloves for sure) followed by some oak, vanilla, and earthy tones, and finishes with rich bread and malt characteristics. This brew has is full bodied and very rich. Trois Pistole is something else."
"Not blown away, but this was pleasant and well done."
"Good dark beer. I've had better, but I like this one. Maybe a bit too sweet for me, but the sugary taste drops as it's being consumed. Tastes a bit too much like wine for my preference, however. Another good Unibroue brew!"
"Nice brew."
"The taste is unique and reminds me of a custom made root beer. The alcohol character is well hidden in the taste. It is sweet bready malt. In the mouth is mealy with a slight bitterness that goes away quickly. Overall a solid brew which I will definitely drink on a yearly basis."
"I really like the mouthfeel and the aftertaste on this one. A real nice sipper. One of my favorite Unibroues."
"D- I could not drink this all the time, but when you are craving something that stands out in complexity, this one takes the cake."
"D: Alcohol presence is virtually non-existant. Have two in a row of these and you'll certainly ""feel"" the alcohol, but never taste it. Awesome!"
"Pours out very dark, with a purplish hue under the light, almost like a very dark red wine. The aroma combination of malts and fruits is very pleasant and unique. The complexity of the flavors is something else -- the mix of malts and fruity esters is complemented by a nice bitter finish. The mix of sweetness, sourness and bitterness masks the alcohol pretty well and makes this very drinkable. A terrific and tasty beer."
"Drinkability is good. I now pick up one or two of these everytime I go beer shoppin'. Not my favorite beer but my favorite from Unibroue."
"Poured a dark brown color with fluffy white head that stayed for a while. Aroma was of sweet dark fruit. Flavor was dark fruit and sweet maltiness with a touch of spice. A bit of chocolate taste at the finish. Mouthfeel was pleasant, and this beer hid the 9% abv very well. Great beer."
"Not a beer to be trifled with...this is a very good strong ale that will leave you pleading for more."
"Drinkability - Great to taste this beer year after year. Keep it in my fridge at all times. It's a juggernaut of a brew! One of my favorite all time Belgians, and the best Unibroue has to offer. This beer was one of the treats that opened the window to the Belgian world for me. It truly belongs among the all time greats!"
"Overall a damn good beer, one that I will be buying in the future."
"An excellent beer, and my 100th review (yay). A malty, tasty treat that I would recommend."
"Pours a dark, slightly cloudy raisin color. A big head quickly dissipates, leaving only a thin skin of off-white foam on the surface. Above-average, lively lacing keeps minimal head constantly replenished. Nose is fruity and sweet, full of malt character. Slightly thicker-than-water mouthfeel marked by a noticeable astringency (almost a pleasant burning). Goes down smoothly. Flavors of raisin/figs/dates and malt (as in the nose) mingle on the palate with a bit of vinous acidity. Sweet, but not overwhelmingly so with hints of spice (cinnamon?). Clean finish with fruity aftertaste is both agreeable and short-lived."
"D: Good for a Belgian strong... not the top of the pack, but respectable effort from those Canadians"
"Verdict: Though it's not my favorite Belgian-style ale, I admire this beer's individuality. It doesn't taste a whole lot like many of the other Belgians I've tried. Definitely worth a try for fans of good, strong ales."
"Poured this into my chalice and receive minimal head that stuck around and had lacings clinging to the glass. With a dense, dark brown body this beer has a very good smell. Dark currants and citric flavors like cherry give it a sour, hoppy smell although the yeat presence is strong. The first thing that hit my tongue is the malts, which seemed sweet and maybe a hint of rosting. There are traces fruits in the beer but more importantly there is caramel (it could be chocolate) in there that gives it a very smooth, almost slick driving force down your throat. There are some spices/pepper in there, natch, that give a slightly dry feel but they are not overpowering, and neither is the high ABV. If it weren't for that ABV I would session this in a second."
"I gave my Trois a furocious spin around the glass to reveale an aroma of raisin bread, cloves, nutmeg, unidenitiful herbs and spices, and a slight hint of banana bread. Taste....my god...Dark chocolate, rasberry, caramel, candied apples, chocolate covered cherries. Mouthful is somewhat cabornated, full bodied, smooth, gracious, velvety. Hell of a damn beer. Treat yourself to what is Trois Pistoles!"
"After having this a number of times from the bottle, this is my first time on tap (and my first review of it). I have never been disappointed by this brew, and I can probably say this is my favorite of the consistently excellent Unibroue selection. Fantastically complex beer that is easy to drink, despite it's high ABV. I whole-heartedly endorse this one."
"Overall - An outstanding Dark Ale - up with the best of the Belgians... highly recommended..."
"Having had a few strong dark beers from Belgium, I can safely say this fits in well, not a leader, but OK. The flavours and smells stay within the feel. A sweetness comes into the mix as the beer warms up, which I don't like much, but all in all a fine beer."
"12 oz. bottle, best by 12/13/09. The beer is a highly-carbonated, opaque, reddish-plum, topped with three fingers of khaki head that leaves decent lacing. Smells sweet and malty, with dark fruits, pear, apple and orange. On the palate, it's almost candy sweet, with caramel malts and a big nuttiness. Some yeast and banana in the mix, and fruity esters taste of green apple and melon, while the hops are spicy and peppery. The medium body is tingly at the beginning, but becomes smooth by the end, lingering nicely on the palate. A delicious, very easy to drink Belgian - I can't wait to see how it ages."
"Pours a dark brown with ruby highlights. Smell is wine like with lots of dark fruits. Plums, grapes, it's all in there. Taste is much the same, with some belgian candy sugar. Mouthfeel is creamy velvet. This is an easy drinker. There are definite port like qualitites with it."
"D- It's a slow sipper. Robust flavor and ABV quelch any hopes of chugging this beer. It's pretty solid. Although I didn't agree with some of the spicing, the complex flavor gave it a bit of a ""wow"" factor."
"D: Great brew to sip on for an afternoon."
"Part two of the UNIBROUE review for tonight. Now is a time for a dark Belgian style brew. Trois Pistoles poured into my tasting snifter and deep darkness, with a small head that quickly vanished. I didn't notice much of a difference between this and the Maudite, except for two main instances. While the smell was similar, it wasn't as pronounced and second, the finish was a lot different. There isn't that ""champagne-like"" finish that you get, which I'm guessing has to do with the yeast used to ferment. It is still a very enjoyable beer, worthy of your time."
"Could drink more of this than expected; alcohol is there but hidden well."
"M + D: Warm, rich, almost silky. Could be a LITTLE fuller on my palate, but that's certainly not to say it's light... and it's definitely delicious. Unibroue has managed an incredible brew each time I have tried them, and this is no exception... it makes it a little tough to pick a favourite."
"Tasted on 1/22/08"
"On tap in Quebec City. Very dark plum coloured body, with an off-white head. Very fruity aroma, full of rich dried fruit. In the flavour I taste sour cherry, vanilla ice cream, dried fruit, figgy pudding and brown sugar. Finished with the signature unibroue yeasty aftertaste. Alcohol is very well hidden."
"notes - fast becoming probably my favorite beer, a staple for me. hooray for unibroue"
"From a 750ml bottle . Best before 06/12/2010.. so a newer batch. Nice enough looking ale, turbid dark brown with a lovely light tan , thick creamy head. Very prominent yeasty aromas,, dark sugar,slight alcoholic aroma, i get raspberries too. Taste is actually pretty tame compared to the aroma,typical belgian yeast and ""spice, yet it is somehow subdued by a stronger malt base, again I get warm alcohol., sweet at the end. Palte to be hnest was pretty average. This is a good beer, but IMO not the great beer which its percentile on here denotes. I wonder if this one was too new, or that its gone downhill since Sapporo took over?"
"A strong good beer. Well i think it's my favorite beer from unibroue. This beer have a good appearance. A beautifull brown-black color. The smell is good, i reconize some chocolat and frouts. In my mouth that better, we have these aroma but with houblon aroma. So, this is a good beer!"
"Poured into a Unibroue glass. Trois Pistoles pours a rich balck color with a slightly off-white head that fills the glass at first and then drops off to about a quarter of an inch. Beautiful fall fruits on the nose. Pear and apple particularly with a ton of cloves. The flavor of the beer matches the baked apples and pears and cloves from the aromas perfectly. Warm mouthfeel, but not from the high alcohol. High carbonation as well. This would have to be my favorite Unibroue overall."
"Overall, the sweetness hurts drinkability. I'm glad I tried it, and I'm sure for some people this is a world class beer. But it didn't quite hit the spot for me."
"D - Not your everyday suds."
"D: This is a great beer for drinking. It is very easy to drink considering the ABV. It is not too sweet or overpowering it is just a perfect balance of flavors."
"This is an incredibly drinkable beer, one that goes down pretty easy and will warm you up."
"I love this beer and it's so tasty. Perfect after dinner sipper, especially on a freezing evening like this. Well made Belgian ale with an elegant nature."
"Nice and sweet example of the style. Good stuff."
"D: Near the top of my BSDA list of favorites. A sipper for sure, and a solid performer..."
"This is an interesting and quit tasty brew. It is a sipper and I may have trouble finishing the bottle. A glass would be enough."
"Drinkability is very good - most of the heavy hitters in this style are quite drinkable for their strength, and this is no exception. This passed the test with flying colors; I'll pick up the 750 next."
"D: This is a very good beer, possibly my favourite from Unibroue, definitely one of the tops in the style, highly recommended."
"This thing is either a dark purple or completely black, some brown hues when held to the light. Very large tan head on the top leaves a fair amount of lace behind. Fruity scents, plum, spices, other dark fruits. Large malt presence on the taste, hints of chocolate. Spice with different fruit tones. Warming alcohol pops its head in as the beer warms. A nice treat indeed."
"Yeah, what a fantastic beer. Is it my favorite? That's a tough call - one too tough to make. But let's just say that I'll be stocking up for as long as this beer exists."
"What an invte this was, five of Unibroue's other beers, one which came out victorious here. I feel priviledged to try them all (yes, even Éphémère, which I disliked), and now I have more confidence for which ones I'll be going back for more of. You can check the previous results of the invite to see what you missed. Good night everyone!"
"I Love this beer."
"Tremendous work from Unibroue, the first I've had from this Quebec brewery and certainly not the last of either Unibroue or Trois Pistoles. I'll be sure to grab a few more of these in the near future for another cold, snowy day. Don't pass this by."
"This is my third sample from Unibroue, and after already trying a couple, I must say that every beer I've had from this brewery has been world-class... Their Trois Pistoles failed to disappoint... top-notch flavor and quality that reeks from this brew... great dark-grape appearance with decent foamy, frothy head leads to a fig and prune aroma... great dark taste, full of caramel, malts, and slight cocoa flavor with underlying sweetness that truly satisfies... despite a hefty 9% ABV, you would never detect any strong alcohol behind a sweet, satisfying combination of ultra-rich, thick flavors that dominate the palate... definintely a top-contender brew, one of the best in my opinion, with a characteristic flavor that is truly unique... Definitely a must-try, a very unique representation of the style that really hits home... Definitely recommended..."
" Oh, and by the way... it's 9 % Alchohol... The folks over at UNIBROUE are alcohol magicians. Definitely try the Trois Pistoles siblings who don't quite offer the fruit complexity, but can hide up to 12% ABV like it was a dirty magazine."
"On a quality/price/strength ratio this is a knockout. You could drink better at higher prices and you could find a lot of mediocre beer at the same price level. This is a damn fine beer that works as a sipper and as a food pairing with roast meat or spicy food."
"D- Amazingly drinkable for a 9% --i could down these better than any macro. This is one of the best tasting ales I have tried easily as good as some beers that are twice the price."
"Overall: An interesting, if mild, brew for a beer drinker. It's to be savored."
"Poured this brew into a chalice and it poured to a deep rusit brown color with a thick off white head that had very good retention and left a fair share of lacing down the side of the glass. The aroma has a lot of interesting smells to it, dark fruit of raisins, plum and maybe a hint of grapes? The flavors are very good as well, make this an easy sipper even at 9%. Has a nice sweet profile that lingers with a yeasty break near the mid section and lingers. Caramel notes seem to come to mind more and more. Spices coe out more and more as it warms. Overall this is a great brew, very sorry that I have not had more of this in the past but there are just to many brew out there. The majority of the time I am very impressed with Unibroue and this just shows why."
"Overall- Nice beer that is true to style. Complex and very enjoyable as a stand alone or maybe have 2 or 3 to really catch a heck of a buzz. Solid."
"Zesty carbonation gives this a great feel, while still not too heavy to sit down and enjoy. The alcohol is masked well, and this one is a great late night sipper."
"D - exceptional brew; it doesn't get much better than this."
"Pours a nearly opaque ruby with a tan head. Nose is yeasty with rubber tones. Flavor is robust with hearty tones, though not overdone. Sweet a fair bit, but also like a grapey caramel. Feel is decent. Smooth with a fairly good level of carbonation. Pretty good as far as drinkability goes, but for the style I think there are stronger examples. Seems to be a bit too sweet overall, which leads me to judge that it has a more immature overall profile. Nice to try, but not one I would return to most likely."
"it really is all over the place, spicy but sweet. i enjoy it, another very good beer from unibroue, i just discovered this brewery and they do some awesome beers."
"Drinkability: Complex and flavorful. Very easy drinking."
"This is another good offering from those crazy french canadians. Pours blackish brown with a thin slightly tan head. The nose is of some spice and dark malts, but mostly grainy belgian yeast. this beer has the good flavor of a belgian, but as is common with unibroue (IMO) the mouthfeel is way too thin to be convincing. You do taste the belgian yeast and dark fruit flavors in the beer, but it does not hit you like it should. Too thin in the mouth. Not sugary enough to belgian. However, it is incredibly refreshing and is dangerously drinkable. possibly one of the most refreshing ""belgian styles"" there is. Very thirst quenching, not afraid to take fat-ass gulps. It has that classic unibroue taste, and is very drinkable. Any beer that has that is ok in my book."
"Pours dark brown with some yeast dregs floating within. Has an almost immortal, prolific tan head that dares you not to destroy it with a drink. Smells of dark fruits and some chocolate in the background. Tastes slightly bitter up front then some breadiness, alcohol heat, coriander and white grapes to round things out, leaving things complex yet balanced to perfection. Fairly light-bodied and very drinkable with a unique residual alcohol heat that warms the palate throughout the session. I will be revisiting this one many times in the future."
"Overall another good beer from Unibroue, although not my favorite."
"This beer is an opaque dark copper with a large fizzy head that fades to a light laceing. The smell is of dark almost burnt malt with a notablely strong phenol smell that seems to volitalize and dissipate after a short time. The remaining aroma's are fruity and spicey and are most closely described as clove-like. The taste is slightly dry with a malty, but not overpoweringly sweet, finish. Some fruityness-grape, plum, etc.- with phenol's coming through as well. Medium to light body with sharp carbonation and minimal cloyingness. Alcohol is hidden decently well, goes down easy. Decent beer."
"Great beer. Plenty of character and a pleasure to drink."
"Pours a dark, cola-colored brown with a bit of yeasty sediment. The cap is two fingers high of a delicate light-brown that descends slowly and leaves large, lingering lacing. The aroma is quite mellow and pleasant. Lots of yeasty breadiness with delicate notes of citrus, light fruits and a perfectly faint hint of alcohol. The taste is perfectly balanced, delicate, mellow. A harmonious blend of bready sweet and light citrus flavors, very little alcohol presence. The same characteristics linger on seemingly forever (and wonderfully) in the aftertaste. Medium and with enough carbonation to add a lightness. Trois Pistoles is a dangerously drinkable offering. It holds up to the bottle's claim of being ""remarkably mellow"" and is delicate and perfectly balanced. I am most impressed at how perfectly the alcohol is presented, hidden enough to be incredibly drinkable, yet present in both aroma and mouth just enough to let drinker know Trois Pistoles is a serious, sophisticated drink to be sipped and enjoyed."
"D: A highly drinkable, highly enjoyable dark beer from Unibroue. Makes a great winter session ale given it surprisingly light body and hides the 9% ABV very well. I highly recommend this one and I can't wait to try it again."
"Drinks okay, maybe with a year or three aging this would mellow out, just a little too hot alcohol-wise for me, you get every bit of the 9% abv along with some complexity. This is alright, but not getting the vibe that had this in the Top 100 other than taste, maybe"
"Drinkability: Definately a sipper.... perfect for the cold winter months."
"This one is chewy but still a little thin for the style which actually lends to a bit of a crisp, refreshing character. I've always been a fan of La Fin du Monde but meant to try other Unibroues, but unfortunately have always ended up going back to an old favorite. This thing however does not disappoint, and I must admit I'm a little upset that I hadn't decided to venture into unfamiliar territory sooner."
"Drinkability- Overall a very good and balanced beer that's easily quaffable, but not something to be guzzled. Like most good belgian style beers it's meant to be enjoyed at a reasonable pace so that all the complexities reveal themselves as the beer warms."
"Taste - More sweet than dry. Chocolate and dark fruit; notes of date and fig. Mild hops but heavily spiced; difficult to pick out specific flavors (a bit of clove, possibly). Moderate carbonation. Medium-bodied; lighter in body than it looks."
"Great beer, I had this over Turkey day and was very impressed. This was a beer I was very happy with, I do like the Chambley that Unibroue offers but this was a pleasent supprise. The first beer from this company was La fin du mond, or the end of the world. I did not like that beer all that much, very drinkable, but not that great, This and the Chambley, were definately beers I would purchase again."
"Good beer for certain. I think I could polish off a 750 by myself. Lay down your 3 gold coins and give this one a try."
"# 3 was, well, trois ; pours a hazy deep ruby-brown w/ a fluffy off-white head leaving some broken lacing in my glass ; a bready/fruity, clove-like aroma, mainly an apple-banana i dunno, kiwi maybe, no hops present ; a very complex flavor, starts w/ a tart, crisp, yet sweet, applish-clove flavor w/ a toasty, nutty note halfway through, a bit of citrusy hop & clove in the end, warms well w/ the alcohol ; a nice surprisingly light and dry body for something this volatile, nice co2 level, sticks around perfectly, to make what i'd say is actually a med. body and still be somewhat sweet ; this is def. drinkable , i consider this one of Canada's finest beers and an excellent belgian strong dark..."
"We're getting 10cm of snow (in November) and I'm happy clutching a BSDA of this caliber. Excellent brew."
"D: This is a solid BSDA. It has the complex flavors and warming ABV. I could work my way through a handful before realizing that I was ""working"". The sweetness and high ABV would eventually limit my consumption."
"Given the ABV i can't drink a ton of these, but it certaily isn't because the flavor either fatigues or gets boring. This is good all day, as long as you aren't going anywhere."
"Mouthfeel comes off as a little too thin, but has a proper amount of carbonation. Drinkability is neither exceptional nor difficult. One 12oz. is good for me, but it's enjoyable until the last drop. Not the most amazing BSDA, but a good example from a North American brewery."
"I love La Fin, but the rest of the Unibroue lineup is either extremely similar (Don de Dieu), or just doesn't measure up. And they all smell the same! I don't mean to be so harsh, it is a good beer, but I wish it had more of a dark fruit character, and the alcohol seems a little too warm. It does however go quite well with a nice piece of dark chocolate."
"Pours a deep brown with an average tan head, little lacing. Rich smell of raisin/cherry, and slight smell of alcohol. Taste is not too bitter, not too malty, not too yeasty, not too alcoholic...just right on all flavors, and very balanced. Incredibly smooth for a 9% brew. A great brew, and one of my new favorites!"
"Wow. How did I go so long without trying this one...this is wonderful."
"Served in a tulip style glass it had a wonderful deep reddish brown color with a nice full head. It smelled of dried fruit, raisins or cherries. It's taste was wonderful, dark malt, fruit and Belgian yeast. It had a smooth creamy mouthfeel and was easy to drink. I've had this in a bottle as well, but I think it was better from the tap. This is easily becoming one of my favorites."
"Tasted really great; my daughter identified ""berries"" in the taste (and I wouldn't dispute that) and I also definitely detected bread there. Nicely complex taste, very drinkable - an excallent beer."
"D - High ABV obviously you're not sessioning this..alcohol his hidden well..a very good beer..would have over and over again"
"Medium bodied, smooth, with a prescient carbonation. Big, but dry and very drinkable."
"Overal, not bad Unibroue has better beers, but this is as good asmany of the Belgian ales out there."
"Drinkability : bière (version 33 cl) voulant s'approcher du style Trappiste Belge, il est préférable de goûter la bouteille de 75 cl."
"This is right up there with Chimay Blue in this (one of my favorite) style."
"MF/D: decent, could be a little smoother, but it definitely does not take away from the beer. Fuller body for the style"
"Drinkability: Very good beer. This is only the second beer that I have had from Unibroue and I am very impressed. Slightly high ABV, but complexity and flavor make this a very good brew. I look forward to trying more from this brewery."
"11.3 oz. bottle gushed forth with carbonation when opened. Pours a dark almost black with reddish hues when held up to light. Nice fizzy off-white 2 finger head, leaving some lacing. Aroma is of malts, chocolate, caramel and some fruitiness a little miskiness detected. Tastes similar to smell, with some bananas, and lots of over-ripened fruits (raisins or prunes), maybe some fig flavors and a nice alcohol warmth in the belly. Mouthfeel is medium viscocity and mouthcoating, but as it moves back, a nice carbonated fizziness is felt on the tongue. Very pleasant indeed. Overall this is another excellent beer from Unibroue. At first I was unwilling to try it, but after trying their Maudite, this is definitely my mug of beer. Will be purchasing and enjoying this much more in the future..."
"d: smooooth & subtly hits you - another great beer from the folks at unibroue"
"not as strong a beer as i had imagined (and i don't mean in %)"
"I could drink this dark beer even on a hot day and it would be refreshing. Has a very good drinkability all year around."
"D - A very nice Belgian dark that I could see myself drinking regularly."
"Dark fruit flavors (plums, raisins, apples) come through strongly, with only minor hints of Belgian spices. There is almost a red wine quality to this beer. The alcohol is masked almost completely, which makes it seem a bit more approachable. However there is a warming finish. Mouthfeel is medium to thick, and well carbonated. I found it to be quite similar to their other dark Belgians, but I can't say if it's better or worse. Just that you know you're getting a quality beer whichever way you go with Unibroue."
"Poured dark and clear into a tulip with two fingers of head that receded quickly and eventually down to a thin film. The smell was fruity with some bubblegum as well, I actually didnt like the smell compared to the other unibroues that i have had. The taste was similar, tasted a bit sweet. The alcohol isnt present in the taste but it does warm a bit which is nice. Carbonation was good but the beer was a bit too full-bodied for me. Overall a good beer but, at least for me, does not stack up to the rest of their lineup."
"Pours a color like brown color with a disappointing head, didn't last long and dissipated into nothing, very flat looking. The smell is typical Unibroue with pronounced corriander aroma, not much else. It has a cola like base that is followed by spice, mainly corriander, with some dark fruit notes & semi-sweet chocolate. It almost has a cola mixed with red wine flavor, not awful like it sounds. The feel is kind of light and very fizzy. The carbonation probably takes away from the taste a bit. The brew starts off quite dry but finishes slick with some alcohol belly burn. A bit of a jumble going on there. All in all a good solid beer, not sure I'm sold on Unibroue. Good beers but they tend to taste similar."
"Unibroue is really turning out to be one of my new favorite breweries. I find myself simply loving everything they make."
" ~ Two sips and I'm lovin' life. This is a very good brew with an excellent 'head'."
"This is my second try with Trois Pistoles. The first time the beer was somewhat cooked and became overly sweet, so I didn't review it. This bottle was treated better but I still was not impressed. Unibroue tweaks its flavor profiles so subtly, is it remarkable how different the results are. For me this one is something of a miss, although it is by no means a bad beer. There are just more complex and tasty BSDAs out there."
"Drinkability? It's 9%, so you may have two, young man, but no more!"
"D: I give it a Lionel Richie... ""All night long"". Oh yeah, I went there."
"Pours a deep brown color, fine off white head that settles fairly quickly. Aroma is somewhat oakey, with hints of dried apricot and a faint yeastyness. Flavor has some grape notes, along with a slight oakey bite. Very nice. Mouthfeel is very smooth to start, but seemed to finish somewhat harsh. Not sure if that was the alcohol peeking thru or not. Drinkability is fairly high. A nice all around brew which, due to the abv, would not make a good session beer, quite possibly would make a good nightcap, which happens to be how i enjoyed it."
"Recommended."
"D- A really good beverage, so far my favorite of all the Unibroues I've had."
"D- impossible to tell it's 9% this beer is so delicious i could drink it like gatorade."
"A pretty descent beer not one of my favorites but worth trying again. I couldn't drink more than one of these as it hits you with a ABV of 9%"
"Could drink a pretty good amount of these, interested in trying on tap if available that way"
"Poured from a bomber and watched the head slowly fizzle away. The color was a dark mohagany. The smell was all over the place. I got fruits, chocolate, you really have to try it yourself. The taste is excellent another great one from this line. I will be buying this one again and recommend this one to anyone that can find one."
"Poured from 750 ml bottle. Pours a deep brown with nice tan-ish head. Thick head at first but quickly dissolves leaving behind a good layer that stays for the rest of the beer. Smell is of yeast, sour fruit (mainly green apple) and some alcohol. Taste is great. Tastes is of some fruits, some alcohol, and some chocolate. A very complex drink. High carbonation leaves a slightly creamy feel and a distinct after-taste. This is a tremendous beer, the only low marks are on the drinkability as this high alcohol content makes it hard to enjoy more than one or two without seeing double!"
"Quite an stellar brew in my book, and just a step below their some of their other offerings (Don, Fin and Maudite). Usually a ""second-tier"" beer in a brewery's repitoire is nothing to get overly excited about. But Unibroue is an exception to all rules. Everything they touch is gold."
"Pours an opaque darkness with a thin wispy light tan head that is kept alive by small surface pools of tiny bubbles that are a give away to the immanent mouth feel. The smell is aggressive and interesting. There is a dark fruit base that is seriously 'kicked up' with something else. All i can associate it with right now is bubblegum which i know doesn't sound flattering, but it complements the flavor. Medium bodied, the tiny bubbles lend a silky creaminess to the entire experience. There are caramel notes in the nose and in the flavor as well. It finishes very clean. A really nice drinker; this one's a keeper..eh!"
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability: Well, I could drink this all night, in fact I plan to, its my first day off in a long while and I feel like getting wasted, and this beer will do that-at 9% it only takes a few. Anyway, the feel is medium-heavy with low carbonation, which befits the style. This beer is easy to drink, hell I just said I was going to drink it all night. Ha! This is a great brew, I recommend it for anyone who is interested in Belgian Strong Dark Ales. So far for me, its this and Chimay Blue. Rochefort 8 is also great, but one can get the to afore mentioned in larger bottles for a cheaper price/oz."
"I will be adding these ""three French coins"" to me fridge more often."
"12oz bottle. Pours a dark brown with lots of head and carbonation. Aroma is divine - smells rather wheaty and yeasty, kind of like Unibroue's Maudite. Flavour is wonderful - again it feels somewhat like a weizenbock. Delicious stuff, with a bit of fruitiness creeping in. Maudite is a regular beverage in my fridge, but this one hasn't been. I'd like to taste them side by side to compare as I feel there are some similarities."
"D - Easy to drink and refreshing on a warm summer day. Could easily consume more of this if it weren't such a strong beer."
"Drinkability- A wonderful sipping and relaxing beer."
"A strange concoction that doesn't quite live up to the fantastic, dreamy aroma. It's big and bold, but interesting. Brace yourself for this one, but isn't that defeating the purpose?"
"Shared this bottle with a friend, and we both agreed that it was a shame that we only had one bottle. Will definitely drink more of this."
" It is a deliciously sweet beer so it is going quite well with tortilla chips and salsa right now. Try this one to start out the night with and be quite impressed by it's flavor and strength."
"Drinkability is pretty good for a beer boasting 9%"
"Medium bodied and smooth mouthfeel. I'm in love with this beer by the time I finish it."
"D - I drank the whole 750ml + was still craving more after the yeast was decanted w/ the last drops of ale. The abv is well hidden it drinks like a rich rum cake in beer form- spicy and sweet."
"12 oz. single bottle from Whole Foods Raleigh"
"I love the label and the beer looks even better. A dark purple almost black with a frothy white head not much lacing. Smells of Unibroue yeast, fruits, and a complex spiciness. A nice fruity, spicy, bitter mouthfeel followed by a warming alcohol finish. Tonight I am drinking with the angels or the devil himself. Either way I am happy."
"If you can afford the $7.99 pricetag on this beautiful temptation of the underworld... Do so of your own accord, for I am forever indebted by the intoxicating hedonistic forbidden affair."
"Poors dark but transparet brown, with a soda-like head that dissipates quickly. The smell is a bit lite, with some fruityness and malts. The taste is quite complex and enjoyable. The fruit that is apprent is subtle and compliments the malts and beligian yeast well. The mouthfeel is a bit lite, which in turn makes it a bit more drinkable for me. Very tasty, very good beer"
"Very drinkable for its potency, and with a great thick feeling that is pleasant rather than cloying."
"My father brought this down from Quebec for me. At first I didn't know what to think of it for the simple fact that it had a cork in it. But i chilled it down and popped the cork. I smelled the cork, even though it isn't a wine, and was pleased with the scent it gave off. It was a fruity scent put i couldn't place, but it tickled my nostrals. I poured it into a pint glass and to my surprise it had a color close to Guinness, but not to dark as to not light a little light through. It had a nice head to it, not to frizzy. When i took a sip, i know i was in for a pleasure. It had a taste that words can't do justice. It had at first the taste of your average Canadian beer, but the after taste was a fruity and enjoyable. It went down quickly and before I knew it i drank the 24 oz bottle in the matter of minutes. I had a good buzz for a while. I highly suggest it you try it for the first time, don't read the bottle. It gives away a lot of it's secerts."
"Overall what else is new. Another desirable beer from Unibroue. This truely is an admirable beer. Ive shown it to wine connoisseurs and they truly believe that it is one of the best beers in the world which in my opinion, is right on the money. Enjoy!"
"Mouthfeel and drinkability are quite good. I myself found myself sipping this rather than gulping, again bringing comparisons to wine. While carbonation is apparent, it's very mellow for a beer and soothing. This is a unique brew to be sure, and I can see those used to drinking macrobrews finding it a bit too strong. If you like good beer though, especially if you also can appreciate a good wine from time to time, Trois Pistoles will satisfy."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable, and very accessible. I feel like I could put quite a few of these down. I may regret it a little after, but it's cheap enough (about 2$ a bottle) that I wouldn't feel like I was wasting something special. A more accessible (and cheaper!) version of a Trappist ale, I'll definitely pick this up again."
"D - This is a great beer. No surprise for a Unibroue beer."
"Had this at Alefest, and enjoyed it better then. Might have had a not so great bottle."
"D - Excellent. I could never get bored with this stuff. Its light and fruity enough to be refreshing in warm weather, and its rich and warming enough to enjoy in the winter months. This is a nearly flawless brew....the only downfall is that it could be a bit too sweet. But that's just nitpicking."
"Very tasty beer which is quite drinkable given the high ABV%. Definately an occasional beer given the price."
"Drank Ice cold, but as it gets warmer its better."
"Edit: Second sampling of this beer bumped the score from 4 to 4.35. Definitely drank too cold first time around. Excellent."
"This beer is truly special. The pour is nice leading to a robust head that is known for its long good-byes. On the nose this beer has a slight sweetness followed by a well rounded malt. The taste of this beer is brilliant! Moreover, it is very drinkable, exceptionally balanced and suited for any occasion. Bravo. One note on the closing, this beer packs a punch."
"Overall, a fantastic beer. Once again I'm very impressed by Unibroue. Highly recommended."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: It's medium bodied and very smooth. Very well carbonated. At 9%, it's strong, but you really can't tell. It's masked very well and it's very drinkable. Certainly not a session, but very drinkable all the same. Overall, it's very good."
"Sweet and delightful, very fun brew."
"fruit taste turns out to be my favourite taste (for now) in Boutique Belgian Ales."
"Pours a deep, opaque brown with a thick and rich head. Aroma is nice, unusual, very fruity, more like that of a cider. Very pleasing flavor has strong pear overtones, is mostly malty with some smoky hints; in a way it tastes more like a cider than a beer. This is a brew to be sipped and savored by itself, rather than chugged or consumed with a meal. I strongly recommend this one."
"D- You could have a couple. It's very very good. mmmm."
"This was my first Belgian Strong Dark Ale and it must be my immature beer palate because I only mildly enjoyed it. The appearance was spectacular with a champagne like head that dissipated fairly quickly. I could smell fruit, maybe cherries, that was pleasing. The taste was a little sweet for my liking and fairly light. The mouthfeel was one of high carbonation. I wouldn't want to drink more than one of these in a sitting. I want to try this style again now that I know what I should be expecting in this type of beer. I'm a stout and porter guy and this was far from those styles."
"Beer pours dark with a reddish hue. Aroma is somewhat nutty with mostly alcohol showing through. Taste is interesting though. Tart and strong with an alcohol backbone. Mouthfeel is warm, almost too warm. Leaves a tartness on the tongue reminiscent of cherry. In fact, cherry is one of the flavors that seems to be in this beer. There's also some raisin hint. Overall, another quality Belgian Strong Ale from Unibroue. Definitely might go well with dessert."
"Drinkability - Not one for everyday of course, but i can see this as a great dessert beer. Probably a good for Christmas. I liken this to Orkney Skullsplitter - another favourite of mine. Trois Pistoles is a fantastic beer."
"This beer is quite drinkable, but with 9% abv, I wouldn't want to sip more than one or two at a sitting. Highly recommended."
"I've been dying to try more Unibroue beers ever since I first had a sample of Maudite on tap, but the price has kept me from it. Now I know what I'm missing. Absolutely amazing."
"Gotta say this is some tasy stuff. I think this cements Belgian Strong Dark Ale as one of my favorite styles of beer. Real deep & rich beer, but not overly heavy on the verge of syrup tasting. Nice clean beer overall. Thanks Fred and Jeff for the reason to buy and drink!"
"D - An excellent beer, although the appearance didn't really show it off as such"
"D- this has similar drinkability to a wine. Its not bad and its definately a different experience that is worth a try."
"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a pint glass. I allowed the bottle to warm for about half an hour before opening. The bottled bubbled over as soon as I popped it open. The beer looked very dark in the bottle. As I poured it, the color was coffee brown. There was a big active head at first, but it quickly faded down to almost nothing. Aroma was strong, alcoholic, fruity, and a little bit spicy. The mouthfeel was thick and smooth. Flavor was malty, fruity, and maybe just a little bit smokey. With some sips I got a slight solvent flavor in the aftertaste; I didn't like that so much. The first time I tried this beer, I found it overpowering; I am happy to have enjoyed it this time. It paired very nicely with the barbecue beef I was eating and held up against the strong flavor of the food. It also served nicely as a dessert afterward."
"D: Goes down too smooth for 9%! Very nice, refreshing, powerful. Great, great beer."
"Considering how rich this beer is, it's remarkably drinkable. One would never guess the 9% abv., at least not while drinking it. Another excellent beer from the folks at Unibroue."
"Another excellent beer from Unibroue."
"Excellent sipping beer. Gets better as it warms up."
"A careful pour, my goblet only holds 12oz, reveals a deep mahogany brown to black beer with medium clarity and a thin layer of tight bubbles on top. The smell is of sweet dark fruits raisins and plums with a touch of an oaky and peppery character along with a slight cloviness and earthy smells from the yeast. In the taste the sweet dark fruit comes through up front along with a decent alcohol flavor and port wine like complexity and warmth. There is a bit of earthy grassy flavors in the taste as well that could possibly be attributed to the yeast, I'm not sure about that though. The mouthfeel is spot on, this beer is very full but has enough carbonation to keep it active on the tongue. The beer finishes very dry with a good deal of pepper and alcoholic spice. A sipping beer but yet dangerously drinkable, it has highly complex flavors but no single flavor or aspect of this beer comes through to overwhelm the senses and make it difficult to drink. I would like to see how this changes after some time in the cellar."
"Due to that issue, I could hardly say it's a session beer, but I could easily knock back a couple without too much trouble. A must try for any Belgian beer fans - I dare say Unibroue is as close as you'll get to the real deal!"
"Final Statement: My second run at Unibroue is much more enjoyable. My palette has really developed over the last 6 months or so, and I find myself really enjoying this one. It's a sipper best suited for winter months. Tonights cold rain is welcomed as well. I think I found my beer for next christmas eve."
"for a beer so strong it is very nice. A brew to be sipped slowly due to the ABV and the overall sweetness, not to mention the complexity in it's flavours."
"This beer provides a great experience! The head is pretty much perpetual until the end. As it continues to warm it continues to get creamier and more frothy. Definitely a warm feel. I really like this beer."
"Pours a dark brown thats somewhat translucent with a decent head and lacing. Aroma is pretty typical strong dark, with light toffee, fig, banana,and clove. Fairly light, though. The flavor is more of the same,somewhat subtle flavors.There are also some vanilla notes and some dark fruit flavors. The mouthfeel is creamy and medium bodied- the creaminess is delicious and makes it worth drinking."
"This particular bottle is still pretty hot and I find myself taking small sips. I won't have any trouble finishing it, but I find I still prefer it aged."
"Pours a cloudy, slightly grainy reddish brown into our crystal sampling glasses. A good half-finger head, white, if poured correctly. Smell is excellent -- that famous Unibroue yeast, mixed with some fruitiness (cherry and other field berry), sourdough bread, caramel, and a hint of molasses. Taste is mildly fruity but very yeasty, especially if you pour some of the ""lees"" in with it. Very mild combination and an excellent moderate mouthfeel make this an incredibly drinkable beer. Were it not for the 9% alcohol, I would love to drink this all day! Wish it were more easily locatable in Ontario!"
"D- good, would only have a glass or two though, pretty potent stuff"
"Medium body, full mouthfeel, with little bitterness."
"Not bad, but I won't readily seek it out."
"The taste of this beer was fabulous. Always a fan of Unibroue products it a rare treat when i see this in a store. I can't find many strong dark ales in my neighborhood but this is a wonderful example. The smell initiailly has a strong yeast smell but it settles to hints of fruit but I can't discern what. It almost has a cedar-like scent. Flavor, mouthfeel and drinkability are all rated highly by me."
"Highly carbonated and medium bodied, coats the tongue in pleasant way. Highly tasty, but high alcohol and high carbonation make it hard for me to drink a lot in a sitting."
"The head on this beer when poured is immense. Its a dark colored beer, with a tan color head. The smell is of faint fruit. the taste confirms this. I bought a 4 pack a couple of months ago, and am just now revisitng this beer. I do not know if the age has dulled the intensity or not, but i enjoy this beer more now than i remember. I could have also just changed taste, but holding one back for a while might be worth trying. The flavors are layered, but im not sensative enough to figure out what they all are. it is a great beer considering the strength and easy to enjoy. I would suggest giving ths beer a try."
"Pours very dark, pretty much black, with only the slightest russet highlights poking through at the edges. Initially the head is thick and off-white, but it fades quickly and leaves little lacing. Aroma is thick with spices and fruits: coriander, anise, maybe some cardamom(?), dried dates. On the palate, a sharp, lightly sweet blast of fruits hits first off, along with a blast of juicy carbonation. Sweet, smooth malts kick up at the mid-palate, then the spices come out before things dry out a bit toward the finish. A final flash of fruit crops up at the very end, then there's a long, dry, buzzy finish that lasts for 30 seconds or so. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, with big carbonation -- it's pleasingly un-syrupy and un-chewy. Overall, this is a fabulous strong dark ale -- one of the best, in my opinion. Great spicing, very good fruit character, and that wonderful Belgian sweet-but-dry character. Wonderful."
" Excellent after dinner or dessert beer, with rich game or roasted red meat. Hell - this would be great with sloppy joes and oreo cookies!"
"Strong is definitely an apt name for this beer, but it is very enjoyable. I definitely wouldn't recommend drinking many of these in one night, unless you want to be on your ass. Recommended."
"Best before 9/8/2008."
"Great brewery that Unibroue."
"This is truly one of the best beers I have tasted from Unibroue. The other beers appear to use the same yeast, which basically give all beers the same yeast profile. I did not taste any of these flavors in this beer."
"Poured an off amber brown with a creamy off white head. Aroma of sweet malt, fruit maybe dried fruit and apple. Taste is spicey, fruity with evident plums and cherries. A medium mouthfeel that is a smooth, easy go down style of belgian strong ale, a definate do over."
"Ridiculously easy to drink, another Unibroue masterpiece. Will be getting a lot of this."
"Good balance in flavor and mouthfeel. The 9% abv is hardly noticed. Probably my favorite Unibroue offering to date."
"Overall: This is a very good interpretation of a Belgian-style dark ale. I prefer the La Fin du Monde, but this is a very nice beer. I won't weigh in on the debate as to whether this is a strong dubbel, a quad, or a ""strong dark ale," mostly because I don't think it matters."
"This is a very good example of the genre, and another great offering of the Belgian style ales from Unibroue. I have yet to have any I did enjoy very much, and would definitely drink this again as well as recommend it. It should pair well with about any red blooded meat based meal, as well as a strong, creamy cheese like a good gorgonzola."
"D- Very complex and a great balance to this brew. It is one of my favorites from them."
"This is one of my favorite beers, the one that really got me into trying Belgian beer."
"Drinkability: Trois Pistoles is an excellent example of the BDA style that has a tremendous amount of complexity. That being said, it does a fantastic job at hiding that complexity when you want it to, and you could drink it for hours on end if not for the ABV. An achievement."
"Poured from a 750ml bottle into my Duvel tulip glass. Appears a dark mahogany brown with a huge two fingers of dense light tan head. Aromas of sweet dried fruits, possibly apricots and caramel malt. Tastes of spicy dried cherry, sweet caramel malts, slight citrus and melon notes. Medium to full bodied with moderate carbonation. Quite refreshing, tasty and very drinkable, but the 9% could sneak up on you. Excellent."
"Pours with a vast amount of CO2. Produces a beautiful light tan head that sticks around forever. The body is dark amner in color. Gives off aromas of fresh baked bread. Slight hints of sweet molasses and bubble gum. This has a sweet pretzel kind of taste to it, without the salt. Feels a little warm and inviting too. This is an outstanding beer. One of the best I've had from Unibroue."
"Pours a very dark brown with some reddish hues into a snifter. There is a nice tan head that has decent retention. Aroma is of cocoa, raisins, bananas, yeast, spice, brown sugar, and alcohol with the taste more of the same. Mouthfeel is a little more thin than I want from this beer, although this may lend to its drinkability. Pretty solid beer."
"I enjoyed this on tap so I thought I'd give it a try from a 750ml bottle. I wasn't disappointed. A rush of ripe fruit as I removed the cork. Even a short-lived wispy cloud eminates from the bottle...very spooky. Poured this into my Duvel tulip glass. The appearance was deep burgandy; a suprising level of carbonation in the head which is not viscous and disappears shortly after your first few sips. The aroma is fruity from raisens, plumbs, dried apricots. Licorice too. Undertones of dates, raisens in the initial taste with carbonation in the finish...not a bad thing but unexpected. Thick, chewy yet smooth mouthfeel. This is a very drinkable Belgian."
"Good stuff."
"Overall this is a nice smooth drinking strong ale. Definitely worth giving it a try."
"Purchased a 12 oz bottle at GrapeVine Market in Austin, TX. As a dark Belgian fanatic, this is easily my favorite beer. I won't bore w/ details, since that's already been done many times over. All I'll say is it has an incredibly complex flavor profile, it's very smooth, and can be enjoyed again & again w/o getting boring."
"It's a quite drinkable beer, although I'm giving it a bit of a hit there compared to the other scores mainly because it does start to feel quite heavy towards the end. Can't drink more than one of these in a session, but that in no way makes it a bad beer. This is truly an excellent beer. I'm glad I have another waiting for me for a future date."
"Absolutely delicious, and perhaps my favorite beer ever. I'd drink it all the time if I could, but it's strong and a little on the expensive side."
"Drinkability: A unique, interesting, and tasty beer. Very drinkable despite the strength."
"Thanks for these Wasatch!"
"I would no doubt revisit this offering from Unibroue. It just can't be beat. It goes down easy, and is just... amazing."
"Like a previous reviewer, brought a four pack from Quebec and poured it into a Trois Pistoles glass. A very dark, brown colour with serious head filled the glass. The head quickly dissolved, but it revealed an intense, yeast aroma. I also noticed a slight odor of fruit. The taste is is my favorite: quick and to the point. The taste of malt, fruit, and spices did not hang around in my mouth as some other Belgian types tend to do. It left a sweet taste on the palate. This beer goes well with any poultry-based dinners. One of my favorites from Unibroue."
"Had this for the first time the other night at Flying Saucer. had a decent sized head that lasted a good while in the goblet they provided. Very easy to drink for a beer that strong. Had a very complex taste, fruit and raisins. Over all, very enjoyable. A little pricey, but for complex beers such as this, it's to be expected."
"drinkability is good. very tasty and enjoyable beer that hides its 9% very well."
"Poured into a Trois Pistole glass. Murky dark brown with a small head. Sweet candi sugar and dark fruit aroma. Tastes of fruit (plums, raisins), licorice, sweet malt, Belgian yeast, chocolate and berries. An evolving flavour. Medium to full bodied mouthfeel. An outstanding strong warming dark ale."
"Unibroue wants to drive me crazy. They brew strong, complex, challenging beer, that I still don't know if I LIKE."
"As usual, incredible artwork on the bottle from Unibroue. This beer poured into a snifter with a menacing dark raisin color, topped off with a foamy light cola colored head. This beer emanated smells of yeast, currant, and subtle alcohol tones. The flavor was a malty dark fruit combo, that drifts into a mild finish of spice. Medium bodied at best, but not a session type beer. Paired great with an assortment of strong flavored cheeses and fresh figs (not the newtons)...Enjoy"
"From the Northcoast Coop here in Eureka, CA. I paid $6.49 for a 750 ml bottle corked & caged. It poured an opaque and cloudy brown with large off-white head that diminished slowly with average lacing. The nose was of burnt caramel with overtones of plum and berries. Flavors were simply explosive in the mouth and were sweet malts, caramel, citrus like touches of oranges and grapefruits, grapes, tantalizing spices, berries and chocolate. Mouthfeel was smooth and rich. Finish was great with just the slightest hoppy and dry bitterness. If it didnt cost quite so much I would drink this all the time"
"I enjoyed this, as I've enjoyed just about everything from Unibroue. I may have even enjoyed this one more. A great strong dark ale at a great price. $6.49 at TJs for a wonderful evening. Can't beat that."
"Trois Pistoles pours a very dark brown with an off white head that fades to a circle around the edge quickly from a brown 12 ounce bottle. The aroma is ripe dark fruit and is quite good. Dark fruit is dominant in the flavor, but there is defintely carmel that is noticeable too. Definitely worth a try."
"T/M/D: Tastes is up front fruit, with what i think is unibroue's unique yeast flavor, subtle clensing hops in the finish. It is dry with ample sharp carbonation keeping your tongue going nuts. High abv is disturbingly hidden. The complexity of this beer is amazing and almost too much for the palate to handle. Nevertheless it is an amazing brew and statement that great belgian beers can be made outside the country."
"I poured this ale into a snifter, it came out a very nice dark amber that almost looked black - even when held up to the light.this was nicely contrasted by lovely light tan head and very little lacing. Trois Pistoles has a sweet slightly woody smell to it and goes down pretty smooth with a mild alcohol after taste. It doesn't have a drisp mouthfeel to it but it is refreshing and has a warming feel to it."
"Feels fairly heavy although bubbly in mouth. Finishes with a dry with a chalky vitamin flavor. A most perplexing beer, but I had trouble finishing my glass, and would not seek to try again. I keep thinking my bottle went bad, but i really don't think that's the case."
"Thanks go out to Wasatch for providing this!"
"Lots of bubbles with this one, had it sitting in the fridge about 2 months and when it was opened the beer acted like a volcano. A nice deep red color this beer is with an aroma of vienna malt and alcohol. Being bottle conditioned it pours much like one of my homebrews, a little yeast sediment on the bottom. Very tingle on tongue with a high carbonation. Has a dry finish with hints of fruit, a complex beer all in all."
"Frighteningly drinkable for the alcohol content."
"Pours a cloudy dark burgundy, with murky orange-amber emerging when held up to very bright light. The head is two fingers high and slightly purplish beige, settling a wee bit too quickly and quite evenly, generating no lace, contour or stickiness at all. The nose is strong and lovely, of plumbs and yeast, plus a bit of indeterminate spice. The mouth is a bit too light, and a bit too well carbonated. The tongue is bombarded with taste sensations, full of fruit and spice. There are no sour notes, neither is it sweet. Rather, the fruit and spice blend nicely and smoothly, complemented by a very subdued hops presence. Coriander determines the aftertaste, which lingers nice and long. A good, solid, drinkable brew worth seeking out. I expected my world to be shaken, but will settle for a very pleasant experience."
"The brew is smooth and dry, with coffee like sweetness. Spice comes after with warming alcohol. Goes down nice an easy, not a chugger so sit back and enjoy."
"I got this in Utah. This was an unbelievably beautiful beer. It poured a deep color, almost black. The head was like four fingers and a light brown color. The retention was very good, but there was no lace. The smell was kind of ansent, but there were malty hints. The taste was also malty. The mouthfeel was sooo smooth. Don't drink and review."
"Excellent beer. Like a dark version of Unibroue's La Fin du Monde. Slightly sweet, with notes of cherry, caramel, and chocolate. Poured a decent head that dissapated slowly. Much better as the beer warmed, and flavors of almonds and sugar came out. One of my favorites from this brewer, definitely worth a try."
"another unique treat from Unibroue."
"Good beer but due to price, $49.99/case for me, more of a once in a while addition for special occasions. Good product!"
"Clearly, this will be an oft repeat purchase, and has merely reinforced the case for exploring the rest of the Unibroue range."
"M/D- Medium bodied and slightly thick mouthfeel, but the carbonation and hops lighten it up significantly....and the sweet malts hide the alcohol...so drinkable its kinda scary...and excellent beer."
"too sweet for me but excellent none the less!"
"Overall, there is so much to enjoy in this beer, it deserves multiple sittings. Classic."
"Impressive in its own way, but the oxidative style and vinegar flavors just don't appeal to me."
"Overall, this is wonderful digestive. The strong alcohol would not make it a session beer, but the few I can drink are greatly appreciated. Sheer pleasure. Would also go nice with a burger/steak."
"This beer hardly tasted like 9% ABV, although I did feel the effects by the beer's end."
"Drinkability: One of those beers that I'd save for a nice special occassion, and open up a bomber between friends. For now the 12 oz version was enough for me. A good solid beer, certainly along the lines I expect from Unibroue."
"Drinkability is excellent. This ale is deliciously balanced in flavor and presentation. Sessionability is limited only by the ABV."
"I didn't like this the first time I had it years ago. Despite the fact that I have grown to like dark beers and strong ales, this one still doesn't do it for me. Not worth the relatively high price."
"Bit more of a fruitier and sweeter variety of a Belgian Strong Dark Ale from Unibroue, and still enjoyable."
"Definitely a good ale from Unibroue. Perhaps not as complex as some other versions I've had (including its sibling Maudite), but very nice nonetheless. Recommended."
"A rich deep sweetness consumes my tongue, smooth and silky. The carbonation cleanses the tongue as it rolls on through. This is one the best beers in my regular Belgian Style rotation. Absolutely love it!!"
"Only bitter and dry enough to force you to raise the glass again. Unbelievable drinkability for the content of alochol. Hands down my favorite accessable dark Belgian. Can't say enough about this beer. Cheers, Unibroue!"
"Three pistols eh? Maybe that's not what it means and why would it? But I'm sticking with my ignorant observation in lieu of something more intelligent and learned sounding. All of the Unibroue selections that I have tasted make me think of hefeweizen to some extent and this one is no exception. Normally I say that with a thumb downturned, a nose upturned(as if!) and no glory whatsoever but not this time. Not my favorite type of beer but this is quality like all of their brews are. There's a bockish caramel-wort taste and a little licorice? Root? Something with a black hand grabbing the tongue and stretching it to places unknown. There are minor flotilla which seem to be little more than garnish, but hell maybe they are giving off all the taste. Anyway lots of leafy and minty essence here. Almost like an icy hot peppermint stick with a candy bar rhythm jumping through a mist of alcohol sprinkler and sliding all the way to the edges of the boneyard invigorating even the dead."
"¡Salud!"
"Thus far this is the best beer I have had from Unibroue which is saying a lot. If you haven't checked this one out yet please do. A fantastic interpretation of the style."
"If you haven't already tried this, and you like the Belgians, then what on earth are you waiting for?"
"forgive me for not spending any more time describing the tastes and smells of this bottle. i am pairing this with some rembrandt aged gouda and the combination is really fantastic. if you've never had this beer, all i can say is that it is the best digestible bargain on the planet (the sticker on my bottle shows i picked it up last year at world market for $5.99!). after the first sip i started planning on picking up more bottles and putting them away in my cellar. enjoy!"
"This beer poured opaque. It has a nice head that lasts for quite a while. The lacing is thick. The smell is somewhat sour, but not overpowering. The taste is lightly malty with a hint of hops. The mouthfeel is not heavy but is bright with carbonation. This is a very drinkable beer that could be enjoyed on a variety of occasions."
"My first taste was simply duplicating what I had inhaled, but there was a thin body of burnt malts and funky raisins. Okay, so I kept drinking it to gather something else from it. After the ale warmed up, it seemed a little better in taste, but I thought that I might return another time to this ale, which is so highly thought of by the BA."
"Mentioned previously, the mouthfeel is great and the alcohol is not immediately noticeable, making this (at 9% ABV) a dastardly drinkable concoction."
"Poured the 12oz. bottle into a tulip glass. Pours a dark murky brown color with a large fizzy light tan head. Aroma is grassy and tart that is filled with many different rum soaked fruits. A light maltiness dominates the start that finishes sweet, tart and dry. Mouthfeel is light and crisp with a high amount of carbonation. Overall, this is another good brew from Unibroue even though I was expecting a little more. Nonetheless, it is recommended."
"One of my favorites, finally got around to reviewing it!"
"Trois Pistoles pours a dark, hazy brown with a light tan head. Effervescent at first, the beer smells of cherry liquor with grapes and a grassy, Belgian spice typical of the style. The flavor expands with wild fruit flavor of figs and dates, along with apples and berries. An earthy, herbal spice accompanies the fruit until the ale finishes with brandy and port taste."
"Another incredible offering from our friendly neighbors to the north."
"This is a very good beer that would be a good example of the style. Quite drinkable and refreshing. Heavy and chewy but not over the top. Go after this one, it's worth it."
"D: Let's just say that I bought the 12 oz. bottle this time. I'll be looking for the 750mL size next time. Fantastic, and one of my new favorites."
"D- This is a great drink. It is great for late night sipping or before dinner because it's very similar to a red wine for me."
"A little too sweet for me to consider more than one glass."
"The Blanche de Chambly is too weak for me, and I really didn't care a lot for their 15th Anniversary Ale, but, I don't think you can go wrong with 90% of their other offerings. My .02¢"
"Presently my favorite beer made by Unibroue. (warning, you may become quite fickle and fall in love ""with the one you're with"" when you taste Unibroue's products for the first time. Trois Pistoles has the wonderful taste and drinkability of Irresistible Brune (sadly no longer made) with a slightly more mild aroma and kick of La Terrible. If you're still upset about the Irresistible, try their Chambly Noire. You'll get over the loss!"
"For the high alcohol content it is easy to drink, going down smoothly."
"Well, this was my second offering from Unibroue, and while I did like this much more than the Fin du Monde, it will probably be my last. I'm just not feeling what makes these beers so desireable to most. Again, not bad, just not my thing."
"Good beer, I would have a few subject to the ABV."
"The appearance is a dark reddish-brown with a big tan head that goes down a bit but lasts throughout. The smell is sweet and fruity and reminds me of red wine. The taste is complex and also reminiscent of red wine. Sweet dark fruits like cherries and figs are evident. I can barely taste the alcohol. A very, very tasty beer. Mouthfeel is carbonated but goes down velvety smooth. This is a very drinkable beer, especially for its ABV. Overall, this is another excellent offering from Unibroue. I love this brewery."
"Beads of carbonation form a lining at the bottom of the glass and then subside to reveal an opaque earthy dark brown liquid with orange tinges. The initially large head subdues to little more than a thin ring. Smells are suggestive of toast, dark fruit and raisins with a distinct hint of black pepper. Sweet caramel and molasses is first to hit the tongue, and is then rounded out with some dark candied fruit and spiciness in the middle. The flavors meld into a long warming finish that is reminiscent of tawny port (as accurately described on the bottle). A slick mouthfeel and very smooth for its hidden strength."
" drinkable beer to be savored slowly"
"D: One of my first craft beers and still a favorite. A great beer at a good price that is readily available. Can't beat that."
"Dark reddish-brown body with very thick khaki head (the bottle almost overflowed on me!). Smells sweet, citrusy, kind of earthy/peaty (sp?), similar to a scotch ale or wee heavy. Tastes malty and citrusy. Relatively smooth. While it's high in alcohol, you almost cannot tell that that's the case. Fruity. Tasty but not overly strong or unbalanced. Medium-to-full body. Definitely a sipping beer, but not overpowering. Good alcohol warming. Another good ale from one of the best breweries in North America."
"Taste with a few other people just in case it's not one for you."
"It's almost like a cross between a belgian dubbel and a winter warmer but it doesn't totally work for me."
"This was fun. It's something that I might buy again on rare occasion, or with an appropriate complementing meal. Or maybe for an interesting carbonated apertif'. Otherwise, not really in my ""drinking beer"" category."
"Mouth is light, sweet, and fruity with a drizzle of syrup. Very bright, dancing all over the tongue. This beer is sweet, but in a such an elegant way. For a 9% beer the alcohol is well disguised. The only thing out of personal preference I might ask for would be more spice. A delicious concoction for sure."
"Another great brew from Unibroue. A wonderful example of the style as well."
"Damn, what's not to like? Plenty of depth, great balance of the sweets and bitters, even a cool label. Bravo."
"Overall...again...it's a Unibroue, which means quality, flavor, and attention to detail. Just another example of their fantastic skill as a brewery. Simply, this beer is phenomenal. A definite MUST have (several times)."
"This is pretty strong brew and is meant to be savored over an extended period of time. The amazingly complex taste keeps you wanting more despite the alcohol content."
"A great brew and my favorite from Unibroue thus far."
"Right away, I knew I was in for a treat. Powerful carbonation , which formed a huge golden-brown tinted head. The head (very) slowly became a swirling island of foam in the middle of the glass, leaving behind sticky lacing along the way. Raisins and toffee in the nose, with undertones of estery-banana and bread. Tastes of rich chocolate, caramel malts and very subtle alcohol. Banana in the finish. Smooth and bubbly mouthfeel. A highly drinkable, yet full bodied brew. This beer is outstanding."
"D: For a beer this high in alcohol, I was pleasantly surprised at how drinkable this was. As it settled a bit and I got nearer the bottom of my chalice, it felt a little heavier, but it was still a real treat for my mouth."
"Mouthfeel was like velvet. This went down very easily. I'd give it a 5 on drinkability except the ABV would limit how much you could drink in one sitting. Overall an exceptional beer."
"This is a great beer that one could drink three or four at one sitting."
"Good beer, not the best but I could enjoy another of these. It went down fast tonight, but I don't think I would reach for a nother just yet, unless it was all I had. Unibroue hasn't disappointed me yet!"
"750ml Bottle. Poured into goblet style glass. 3 finger head developed but quickly dissipated into lacing that lasts until finished. Smell: Plums. Definitely plummy. Taste: Cannot describe. Palate not refined enough, but...Very damned good. Mouthfeel: I'd agree that it's harsh. Not bad though. I'd definitely bring a few bottles of this to a family gathering."
"Drinkability: Eminently drinkable beer that stacks up well against other beers in the style - this really should be the jewel in Unibroue's crown. Exceptional. I can't say enough good things about this beer, so I'll stop."
"Overall: My comments for this beer are similar to those for Maudite."
"Mouthfeel is a little harsh, I believe. The beer could benefit from a lighter carbonation. Drinkability is good - the taste is great, but the mouthfeel could use some work, I think."
"D - Very nice overall, although I found the carbonation a bit much for the style. Recommended."
"Something about the smell & taste is very mysterious & dark -- in a very good way! An imaginitive, tasy, and exciting beer. Unibroue does it again! Great for a special occasion on it's own, or with a somewhat heavier meal. Lovers of both Belgian beers and great, unique-tasting beers will enjoy this."
"This beer might have the best presentation that I've ever seen. The artwork on the bottle and foil top make for a very appealing package. With that out of the way, this beer pours a deep and cloudy brown with reddish hints glinting around the edges. Extraordinarily effervescent, I'm caught by surprise as the head erupts out of the bottle and all over me and the chair I'm sitting in. In the glass, the head is a light tan, and builds to a quite substantial hight before settling in, thick and fluffy. Smell is sickly sweet, with loads of grapes and berries, along with yeast and spices. Taste is better balanced, with the grapes and plum still playing a prominent role, but supplemented with vinous notes and a spicy alcohol bite. Finish lasts well, dry and woody, thanks to the spectacular mouthfeel. Clinging and thick, with just the right amount of carbonation. Drinkability is good, a nice brew to savour and appreciate. A real winner from Unibroue."
"Too much spice for me too drink more than 1 or 2 but a damn solid brew."
"Who says that Belgian beer has to be brewed in Belgium? These guys do a great job and this is one of their best. Poured from the small bottle, pours almost black with a frothy, light tan head that quickly dissipates and leaves very little lace. The bubbles aren't the microscopic, persistent ones of some of the trappists and the dissappearing head is probably the beer's achiles heel. Beyond that, though, very few complaints. Smell is sweet, with notes of bananas and...figs? Taste is fruity, then notes of chocolate, with a warming alcohol finish and those figs again. Very smooth, satisfying mouthfeel, really lets you know you're drinking a beer without making you feel you have to chew it. Drinkability is excellent, I could sip these all night. Sip. They are 9%."
"Very dark brown apperance with fizzy head. Gone pretty quickly and with very little lacing. Aroma is very fruity as I would expect. Typical cherry, apples, red wine, and bread. A lot of carbonation, which I've come to expect from this brewery. A bit of a shock to the tongue. Good long finish. A very good example."
"This was my second Unibroue sampling and Im looking forward to trying more!"
"Aroma of ripe, dark fruit....mostly plums and grapes. Very carbonated taste at first, warms to a very tasty, thick bodied beer. The alcohol becomes more noticeable late in the glass, and leads to a very warming finish. This is most definitely a beer that I could only enjoy sipping slowly, and one a night (Max), but a very good drinking experience."
"Always seem to be having this after I have tried several others - this is worthy of trying solo to allow you to fully enjoy its complexity."
"Drinkability - Dangerous. 9% ABV in a smooth, refreshing, sweet beer. I could drink this all night till I am no longer standing. This is among the best beers I have ever had."
"D - mmm, delicious! I think if it were 60 degrees cooler outside and I was by the fire I would not mind enjoying this again. Pretty heavy and potent beer so don't look for to be refreshing but absolutly delicious none the less."
"Very dark, almost black in the center with a redish-purple hue close to the center and around the edges. Good sized caramel colored head that lasted as a 1/2 cm thick film throughout the beer. The aroma was of Belgian yeast, thick and syrupy, lots of esters, a bit like a hefes banana/clove smell, with some brambles in the background. The taste was of course very Belgian, yeasty and bready, but very sweet as well. You can tell it's a toasted malt, but the malt is not really a bitter toast, it stays very sweet and fruity, I really like the hint of rasberry I got in the finish. The mouthfeel is very light, sweet tingle, much like a wine. This beer is so very drinkable, the bottle went down easy and fast. Forget ""drinkable for a 9% beer," it's drinkable compared to any."
"Drinkability: one was enough. I had high expectations for this one, and maybe they were too high. It was good, don't get me wrong, and more drinkable than a lot of Belgian-style ales because it's not overly sweet, but I just didn't get the complexity out of this one that a lot of other reviewers seem to have - maybe I'll have to come back to it sometime."
"Drinkabitly is great , the alcohol is well hidden in this beer."
"Jen: For Unibroue, this seems to have very few bubbles in it, although, it does have a very smooth flavor. The color of this beer is a rich and dark. I get a nice warm feel from the slight alcohol twinge in it. There is a mild presence of some fruits and sugar with a mild spiciness to it that leaves a tingle on my tongue. Other than their Ephemere, this is my most liked Unibroue's."
" For me the ABV makes this drinkable, but in moderation only."
"Cheers!"
"I like this beer a lot. Its a staple around the house for me. Unibroue has hit the mark again."
"GO TO REDBONES TO TASTE IT ON TAP!!"
"This is a sipping brew through and through, and one that I wish I had purchased in a 12 oz. packaging. Still, a nice belgian style ale."
"delicious"
"Poured a dark brown color with a medium sized head that left very light lacing on the glass. Aroma was very fruity, must be the plums with a light cheesiness, perhaps from the yeast.. Taste was very similar to plums as well, very fruity, with yeast, and some light alcohol. I don't see this as one I could drink everyday."
"The flavors and feel of this beer mask the 9% alcohol to the point that it would be very easy to drink more than one in a sitting."
"Poured into a chalice style glass. Color was a very dark, rich brown, with a minimal, cream-colored head and no lacing. Smell was very fruity, with hints of plums and cherries and some subtle spiciness. Taste had a very mild sweetness to it, with the fruity notes of plums and cherries, spiciness, and hints of chocolate. Very tasty. Medium-bodied with warming alcohol. The myriad of flavors could be a little bit of a turn-off for some people. Very rich and flavorful beer."
"Taste is sweet, rich & mellow. Full of raisins, plums and dark cherry with hints of molassas which all work together to hide the advertised 9 % ABV whos warming presence is felt by mid glass."
"Medium body, a rewarding sipper."
"Pours deep chestnut with amber highlights and hazy clarity from the yeast pour. Pale biege head fills glass, then slowly sinks to three fingers and holds well. Leaves sticky patches of lacing. Phenolic aromas like cloves, plums, and raspberries. Spicy alcohol and some weak roasted malt in the background. Steely caramel and evident alcohol at first sip. Massive phenolic yeast character, cloves and fruit, followed by a faint touch of styrian goldings that gives the aftertaste a dry tone. Lingering caramel and alcohol taste. Medium body, highly carbonated, the crisp body softens the blow of booze and phenols. Finishes residual but with a comfortable dryness. A little on the sweet side, but the crisp mouthfeel and yeast bite round out the flavor well enough for a decent drinkability."
"Good beer, needs to be layed down for a couple of years"
"The flavor follows the aroma, as complex flavors initially bite, and mellow to a smooth aftertaste. 9%, but the alcohol taste is masked well. Definately a beer to try, to sip on, to enjoy. I'd drink it again."
"-Oelergud"
"Drinkability - this is good, goes down well, high abv limits it to one 750 ml serving in a session."
"I forgot to mention: I sampled some dill havarti and Parmesan with the beer just for the heck of it. The Parmesan was definitely more interesting. Side note: the havarti went great with the Erdinger Dunkel I drank last night."
"mf/d- Tingly and smooth. Very slick and thick. I could drain these all night. This should be sipped though because it will kick your ass."
"Delicious."
"The mouth is very nice, it is fruity, very grassy, and the alcohol gets you after you drink it down. Nice beer and nice trade."
"Taste is extremely potent, an explosion of complexities. Tons of spice, the comfort of all that Autumn fruit combined with the zestiness of coriander, cloves, and maybe even a bit of cardamom. Some caramel perhaps, and that wonderful wheatiness and yeatiness that truly makes this an incredible dessert beer. Well hidden alcohol. I could seriously savour this for hours. Zippy on the tongue, but soft in the throat. Slides down like nothing, but I can't help but savour each mouthful for an extended period of time. This is a great sipping beer. An excepional offering from Unibroue, cheers to the greatest brewery in Canada."
"Another outstanding beer from an outstanding brewery."
"Another good brew from Unibroue"
"I would recommend this for anyone and I'm thinking of picking up a second bottle for extended cellaring (even though this brew was nearly a year old when I tried it)."
"I keep buying singles, then going back for a 4 pack. (yep, I buy the little bottles...they seem perfect for me)"
"These bottle ripened beers never cease to amaze me. They are full bodied and contain odd yeasty notes that can be compared to an almost fruity flavor. The head rolls out at you when you open them and stays for the full ride. The aromas and over all look of this beer are very unique and beg you to taste it. With an almost sweet initial taste the drinkability of this beer is high with a definate ""here taste this"" appeal. One of my favorites."
"What can you say about this one?? Trois Pistoles is a fabulous beer. Really fruity, especially in the smell, with ripe fruity plums being the main smell. Pours a nice head that sticks with the beer all the way through. Reasonably priced for a belgian, and I don't know if it is the water Unibroue uses, or what...but it has that great Unibroue taste to it. I think Unibroue makes the best dark belgians out there. Extremely drinkable as the alcohol is not overly detectable. One hellava brew!"
"Drinkability: With all of its complexity, this is a very approachable beer and one of this brewery's best"
"Drinkability: Probably the best Belgian strong dark ale I've had."
"Overall: An outstanding strong dark ale, one of my favorites and enthusiastically recommended. Though Unibroues La Fin Du Monde (a strong pale ale) is rated higher (35th vs. 58th), I still prefer Trois Pistoles."
"Dark borwn color witha finger width white head that left a nice ring around the glass and spotty lacing. Plum, raison, red grapes, cloves, and fig were all noticed in the smell. Taste was of clove, plum, vanilla, candi sugar, spices, and yeast. Medium bodied with a good carbonation. Gets better as it warms and will try this one again."
"Feels very light on the tongue. Fizzy like a champagne, almost no indication of the high alcohol content. Smells of green apples and honey, taste lets the sweet come forward into caramel, but all very understated beneath fairly belgian-tasting hops. Ends with a mineral bitterness that actually pretty refreshing. Not a beer you need a drink of water after."
"Served in Unibroue glassware at the Flying Saucer."
"Pours dark, nice color with a moderate head. Aroma is very mellow. Flavor is noticably alcoholic, with mild sweetness and fruit flavors. I was expecting more dark sugar flavors, maltiness and body; the mouthfeel was just a tad too light. Not my favorite strong dark Belgian-style ale out there, for sure."
"I forgot how good this was."
"This pours a dark red/purple with a giant foamy head that lasts forever, very impressive looking. The smell is strong alcohol, dark fruit, grapes, Belgian sugar, and some sweet malt. The taste is strong with brandy, dark fruit, grapes, sugar, and some oak woodiness. The alcohol is not strong in the taste at all. The m/f is surprisingly light with a nice blend of all the flavors. This is a classic beer that if you can't find it, drive to Canada at once !"
"This was served in a beer goblet, and the beer is brown with a bit of purple/red tinge to it. It produced a big, carbonated head that lingered around for a few minutes. There's a light fruity (prunes/plums/raisin) smell to the beer, very nice and not overpowering at all. It's not as ""thick"" as I expected it to be, but I could definitely feel the carbonation while I was drinking it. Even with the carbonation, it was very easy to drink. It tasted pretty much like it smelled, nice and fruity but not very strong at all, at least not as strong as I expected a 9% ABV beer to be. There's a fruity aftertaste to the beer too, but it doesn't last too long. I really couldn't feel the alcohol in it when I started drinking it, but it kicked in closer to when I finished drinking it. Definitely an excellent offering, and I'll definitely try it again. It's the first beer I've had from Unibroue, so now I want to try the other ones I've seen too."
" Eric"
"Full bodied, frothy, creamy mouthfeel with some deep down warming that's easy to consume, but not a sessioner in my book...more like a night capper or cold weather blanket. Not for the faint hearted, cheers!"
"dark, kind of purpleish and brown. no head really. looks like a red wine. smells like dark fruits and ethanol. malty fruity taste...prunes, plums and molasses. some spicy notes too. i also get some raspberry/strawberry in there as well. very thin, surprizingly so. but pretty darn tasty and very easy to drink. another good bottle of beer from Unibroue."
"D: Definately a drinkable beer. Unibroue has great offerings and they just keep me wanting to try everything they've got."
"Tasty stuff, but watch that alcohol!"
"This beer poured into my Chimay chalice a deep mahogony color. There is a thin head. There is also lots of yeast that has settled to the bottom of the glass. The smell is sweet and a bit like plums. The taste is very powerfull and fruity. The mouthfeel is overpowering at first and then calms down into a lasting aftertaste similar to apricot brandy. The drinkability would be better if not for the overpowering abv. I probably will not have this beer again."
"D- pour me another"
"-UF"
"Mouthfeel is medium, very smooth, finish is clean with a small acidic bite. Stands up as well or better than just about any native Belgian ale. I've had this beer many times before without being impressed but this bottle really just struck me the right way tonight."
"Potent abbey dubble from Unibroue.. copper and opaque with fruity notes and smooth malty overtones.. this beer is quite drinkable yet very full bodied and high in alcohol.. a great beer with cheese and spicy food as well as chocolate. enjoy in slow sips to fully appreciate this strong dark brew."
"Eh, I don't know why I'd drink it again-- Fin du Monde and Maudite are much better crafted. I think this was much too sweet and just indecisive in terms of its flavor. I heard good things, but I was generally unimpressed. Nice to have tried it though."
"Drinkability: Another excellent beer from Unibroue and a must try beer from this brewery. Even though I couldn't feel the ABV it's probably wise not for me too drink too much of this beer in one sitting. This is something I would consider purchasing agian in the near future."

"A dark ruby colored pour, looks rich in sweetness. Has a raisiny scent with strong alcoholic overtone and heavy carbonation. This a gret Belgian strong but not my cup of tea. This style and taste I'm just not fond of ....yet still another great brew from Unibroue"
"I'd drink it again, in a hearbeat."
"Brew poured a Burgundy-Brown color with a tan bubbly head that sustained well. Upon initially popping the cork, the nose was like a merlot. Dark fruits and malts did dominate the smell upon warming. Tastes noted were the presence of Belgian yeasts, dark fruits, and light hops. Initially the warming alcohol was dominate in the finish but towards the end of the bottle it was not noticeable. Mouthfeel had the classic Unibroue feel to it. There is almost a champagne like feel but it is more velvety smooth than champagne. Overall drinkability is that at 9% it packs a punch which makes this a one at a time brew for me. The initial warming makes this a great winter brew. This is definitely another very good beer that I would recommend."
" There's a lot here to like. Although cleaner and not as heavy as many similar beers, Trois Pistoles is an authentic craft Belgian with a full taste and satisfying body. A little steep in price but take the splurge at least once, this is quality stuff."
"This has long been my favorite of the Unibroue beers, and one of the reasons I enjoy Belgian beers as much as I do today. I hadnt had this beer in a while, but Im glad to say I still love this beer. Had it on tap at Zenos in State College. Attractive dark, hazy brown with a small, creamy, off-white head that quickly diminishes to a thin film. Wonderful wine-like aromas and flavors, dark fruit, berries, oak, spice, and warming alcohol that kicks up a little on the finish. It feels light in the mouth yet is huge in flavor and feels big on the finish. This is the reason why at beer expos, I still have to stop off at the Unibroue table for a beer even if I have had all the beers they have at the time. Fabulous!"
"D - medium, must like spiciness, but good"
"Mouth feel was smooth with low carbonation. Great beer for the style."
"Drinkability: The high abv goes completely unnoticed, while the carbonation really keeps this beer going all the way to the bottom of the glass. This is simply an excellent beer."
"12oz bottle: This pours out a dark, mahogany color. There was somewhat of a tan head, but it doesnt last long. The aroma contains many of the dark fruits that are indicative of this style. Also a touch of breadiness and yeastiness. The taste is very smooth. It is full bodied, yet the individual tastes are quite subdued. They all blend together to form something quite nice. A definite keeper. Dont mess with this beer, Sleeman!!"
"This has to be one of the best Belgians ever, Canada or not."
"This is a special beer. So rich and complex...so very good... A damn tasty, first rate Belgian (from Canada)."
"I think this would be a great beer to enjoy with a cigar."
"The beer pours out a hazy, and has a magnificent head that stays around for minutes and leaves lacing down the side of the glass.. Has a very clean taste. The beer is very strong, but the alcohol is subtle. This is the first dark Belgian style ale that I've ever had, and it was delicious. I'm now determined to go and try an example of this style that's actually from Belgium. Delicious beer."
"This from a 750ml bottle with drink by 8/9/08 on the label. It was a hazy dark brown color with a thin coffee-colored head. It had a pleasant fruity (raisin/currant) odor. A wonderful spice/fruit flavor, with a touch of alcohol. A little too carbonated for my taste, but all in all a very good beer."
"Note: I tried it with some cheddar cheese and I felt like that was a mistake. The cheese just pulls all of the alcohol through to the point that it's almost unbearable."
"Unibroue, what can I say. So far everything I've had from them has been great. Trois Pistoles is no exception. Pours a very hazy dark brown, Smells like dried fruit and malt. Taste? Again like dried plum, apricot and malt. Mouthfeel is very nice, not too thin or thick. Overall very drinkable, definetly for savoring."
"overall, i am not as impressed as i was hoping to be, i guess i just haven't really latched on that well to Belgian styles, i will probably keep trying though."
"The taste is spicy and fruity. Like meaty plums and black cherries married with spices. Mouthfeel is robust with just enough carbination to fill ones mouth. I love this stuff!"
"Ah Trois Pistoles. Poured dark , cloudy ( more opaque ) blackish brown with tinges of deep purple. Head was lively and large , about 2 and a half inches of tannish foam. Once this dark belgian ale is taken to the nose, aromas of sweet, dark, ripe fruit , dark roasted malts , bit of chocolate, some yeast and well hidden alcohol implore you to taste. Flavor is rich , round , and dark blend of ripe fruits and dark malts , yeasty characters , mild spicy-grass hop tastes , a tad bit of bakers chocolate and slight but warming alcohol presence. Mouthfeel is smooth and heavy. Very drinkable dark ale , especially for its ABV. Man this is one great beer invention!"
"There's lots of reviews on this already so I'll only add this. If you can get this on tap do it. There is a nice evening out of the carbonation and yeast flavors others have noted since it's not bottle conditioned to go along with the wonderful malty / raison / spice flavors. Very well balanced, nicely flavored and a treat to drink. I will order this again and again!"
"An excellent brew, highly recommended."
"Beautiful tan head that clings to the glass. Leaves a solid curtain of fine lace. Dark with ruby hilights. Wonderful aroma but the mouth feel is too carbonated and bit rough. However that being said it goes down nicelyand tastes rich. Bottle feremented so there is a yeast flavour along with complex fruitiness."
"The taste, similarly, was complex, but I thought it was well-balanced between roasty malts and hops. I loved the nice warm alcholic finish, though  that part was unmistakable. It had lively carbonation and I only marked it down slightly in drinkability because I felt its hefty 9% ABV revealed itself a little more than other Unibroue beers of the same strength."
"Overall this is one fine beer. Its not my favorate from unibroue, and its also not my favorite style. But this is a great beer i wish i would have right now in front of a fire. great cold weather beer."
"I had high hopes for Unibroue Trois Pistoles. Why, exactly, I have no idea, since nothing that this brewery has yet released (that I've tasted) has lived up to the hype. I've found that the higher alcohol brews (Maudite, La Fin Du Monde, Don De Dieu) have been more to my liking than their lower alcohol counterparts. That said, they still can't hold a candle to the Belgian originals. This is good beer, but it isn't even close to special."
"M/D - Begins with a mere hint of sweetness and finishes on the dry side. The alcohol is hidden well enough to climb up the drinkability ladder a bit, but all in all the beer is a bit thinner than I would have liked to see."
"Corked and caged 750mL. Clear, dark burnt orange colour with a generous, moussy head. Good retention and lacing. Really cool aroma, with lots of plum balanced nicely by cloves. There's a bit of berry and citrus that help make this quite a unique combination of aromas, of course backed up by some bready yeast and light alcohol. Interesting flavour with lots of complexity. The spice ties things together and there's a solid malt backbone there as well. Fruits and alcohol waft in and out throughout, each character there for an instant before making way for the next. Hints of tartness and malt peek through. Sweet, spicy finish that's just off-dry, and there's a hint of lemongrass here as well. Medium bodied yet quite airy - the beer almost seems to disappear on the palate due to the full, well-integrated carbonation. Alcohol is very well hidden, but shows itself in a delicate warmth. A superior offering from Unibroue. This is incredibly easy to drink given the strength. Superb!"
"Drinkability: nicely drinkable even with the higher alcohol levels. More than one bottle can be easily consumed, but you will be feeling it even if you are slowly sippin' this."
"Drinkability is truly great and, all things considered, this really is another solid entry from Unibroue. I'm going to pick up some more of their stuff later this week and re-review. I think they have a knack for creating beers with complexities that are worth exploring more than once. This one is recommended."
"Pours a nice dark brown with hints of ruby and a fat and lively head that lasts and lasts. As the glass emptys the color gets more dusty and brown, with some nice yeast suspension. The smell is sugary with dark fruit and yeast. The taste is huge and malty. Lots of complexity. I get some dark fruit notes like dates, raisins, and a little bit of plum, yeasty esters, alcohol flavors, and big doughy malts. Mouthfeel is slighly thick, a tiny bit astringent, and sadly, there is even some undesirable alcohol burn to the throat. The alcohol could be masked a bit better. Overall, I would say the beer is well balanced in all respects. Drinkability is only inhibited by the ABV. This is certainly a pleasant brew."
"Pours a very dark brown with a slightly reddish hue, leaves a thick, two finger foamy beige head that falls quickly to light off-white lacing. Aroma is yeasty, along with rich and dark sweet fruits, primarily plums and dates, along with slight hints of cherry. Taste is well balanced between a sweet maltiness and lighter hop flavors, cloves present as well as some nutmeg spiciness. Can't help but mention that the overpowering carbonation is hiding a great deal of the flavors in this brew. Mouthfeel is smooth past the heavily carbonated medium body of this beer. Easily drinkable, intriguing beer, overall very enjoyable, might seek out again."
"Poured into a large tulip-style glass as a very dark, slightly reddish black. Ruby-like. Light sand colored head that didn't persist. Sporadic lacing. Nose betrays the ""Uniboue"" yeast scent right off the bat. Accompanying plum, exotic spice, and dessert wine notes. Very complex and very lively. More balanced flavor between maltiness and hops than I would expect. Hops are more assertive here than anticipated. Very strong flavors, further accentuated by the hop presence. An almost biting finish that is medium-bodied. Another great, great offering from this Canadian brewery. I've never had a bad, or even average, beer from these gentlemen. Get it. Love it."
"Santé"
"Super easy to drink, a fine Belgian dark."
"Beautiful deep, dark brown color with a massive tan head that's three fingers thick, and would be more if my snifter was bigger. The smell is a nice mix of dark fruit, belgian yeast, and mild alcohol. Taste is initially fruity, like raisins and bananas, and becomes sweeter with hints of cocoa. Its a bit spicy and alcoholic in the finish, maybe a bit sour also. I might detect some clove in there also. The mouthfell is nice, rich and semi-thick, good carbonation, it coats the palate well. Alcohol rides a bit high so its hard to drink alot of this, but its very tasty and a good end to the night..."
"This beer pours an attractive hazy, dark brown color with a fluffy 1 and a half inch head that sticks to the glass. The aroma is sweet, with hints of ripe fruit, toffee and spices. I can tell this is gonna be damn tasty! The first taste confirms this as my mouth fills with a cascade of flavors, including ripe fruits, citrus, toffee and spices. The finish is sweet with a hint of hop flavor at the end. This beer is very rich and full bodied and was just what I needed on a cold winter night. Not a beer for the faint of heart. Excellent."
"This is my favorite offering from Unibroue with its sweet tastes and smell. This sample was from a 12oz bottle. Pours a dark redddish/brown color with a giant head. Smells of fruits are exploding from this beer and the tastes are similar with plum, strawberries, and a smooth malty finish. This is one beer I love to give to my BMC friends and show them what they are missing."
"This beer pours a weaker head that dissipates right away leaving a kind of sticky little lacing and head. It has dark to amber color tones. Smell of sweet candy and hops is strong, and it's coupled with some breadiness and yeastiness. The smell has also plum, nutmeg and very strong clove. The taste has a vanilla undertone that I noticed right away and the taste also had plum, nutmeg, and clove. The first mouth feel is a little watery, but gets better as it warms. It's definitely intriguing and makes you want to have more."
"Overall a very full and complex brew. Lots of flavors swirling around to keep your interest through the entire beer. The high ABV is well hidden. This is the 2nd offering i've had from Unibroue and i've enjoyed them both tremendously."
"Lovely beer all in all. If you like dark beers I highly recommend it."
"Pours a 4-finger caramel-colored head over a slightly particulated dark brown liquid. Smells musty phenolic. Funk. Clove and candi-sugar. Chalk and wet sand. Tastes fizzy carbonation with some sweet. Unfortunately, the carb is the most notable feature. Clove and pumpkin pie spice. After swrling heavily several times to release the pent up carb. Coffe rum raisin with chocolate. Caramel and dried stick. Ashes from a wood fire-pit. Md-light body and potently carbonated. Pretty tasty once I released most of the carb."
"This beer poured a dark dark amber, with a tall white head. It smelled slightly fruity and malty. This beer was very smooth, and malty, with strong molasses and caramel flavors, some fruit and a very present alcohol flavor. this beer was very dense and smooth but not to heavy. I definatly liked this beer a lot and intend on getting it again."
"There's an alcohol spiciness on the back-palate which nicely cuts through the sweetness. Richly layered. This is a very fine beer. One I'll enjoy again and again."
"It's nice, dude, I really like it. I mean, it's not Chimay Red, cos my pants aren't white and sticky, but it's nice. Very nice. Surprising, really."
"Pretty tasty. I like it alot more than the only other Unibroue brew Ive tried (La Fin Du Monde). Packs a nice punch."
"This is a wonderful brew. Unibrou makes great beers and to me this is one of the best of them. If you like Belgian dark you need to try this one."
"It may have been too thin, but nice to sip a sixer, even with the 9% hammer. Im really looking forward to the other strong dark ales from Unibroue."
"Overall I'm a little dissappointed. Favor lacks vibrancy (due to cellaring?). Blending is only okay with a heavy alcohol presence."
"Very nice dark brown pour with thick tan head. Smell is of mellow spices with just a touch of sweetness. Taste is very good, nice carbonation, sweetness comes through at first touch and fades into more spice. Provides just enough aftertaste to make you want to take another sip. Alcohol is very well hidden, but it's definitely present. This beer is just an absolute pleasure to drink."
"750 ml bottle, cork and cage, cool label. Pours a deep and dark chestnut color, thick tan head, lots of lace. Lots of aromas including caramel, spices, and apricot and other dark fruits. Full flavor of sweet malt, caramel and toffee, a bit woody almost oaky, some spices. Also a touch of sweet cherry. Full bodied, leaves a nice alcohol warming sensation. Full flavored, yet still refreshing with a long smooth finish. I had a hard time finding this one, but definatley prefer it to Maudite (although there is nothing wrong with it either). Must get more - some for now, some for the cellar."
"Very nice. Had the bottled version of this in a beer tasting event. It pours a very nice dark amber brown like cherry cola. Has very little nose out of the taster glass even though the glass has a bit of a bell. Too light of a scent to describe. The taste is a nice balance between hops and malt. A smooth mixture of fermented fruit and caramel flavors. It has a bit of the warming afterglow from the alcohol. Very drinkable. I will be trying more from this brewery and will defiantly get this beer."
"Drinkablilty: This whole review is just me making up stuff to say about a great beer i thought was unbelievably good i didnt examine it or anything i really didnt expect to like it because im not a belgian style fan because they are usually sweet and im not into that but wow this beer is definitely on my list for a ""must have again"" in the near future ...only problem is its pretty strong and id probly get hammered if i drank too many pints of this....but i never wanted this one to end....bravo"
"Overall impression: Very well balanced example of a Belgian style - well made, balanced, and quite complex."
"Whoo! How to rate drinkability? Could I have another? I dunno... I'm happy just enjoying one! This beer definitely has everything covered. There isn't anything in the scent, flavor or feel that dissappoints me at all. Cheers!"
"12 ounce bottle. Trois Pistoles pours out a very dark brown color with a reddish tint. The aroma is dark fruit, caramel, and spices. Flavor is dark and malty with lots of yeast flavors. Fruity flavors include plums, grapes. A sweet candy like flavor comes in at the finish. Peppery spice. Full mouthfeel. The 9% abv is well hidden. What a great beer! I love how Unibroue makes all these Belgian style dark beers that are similar but have enough subtle differences to make you appreciate each one."
"I want another already. High ABV will lower the drinkability a little, but I could easily down two or three of these and call it a night."
"This beer pours a dark coffee brown with hints of burgundy and mossy green that is surprisingly transparent considering its darkness. The head consists of a thin film of bubbles. Smells of musky yeast, root beer and sour red grapes. Tastes of sweet and dry wheat, a mild yeast with a mild coffee-like bitterness. There is also a metallic tang of plumb skins and sour cherries. The mouth feel is medium bodied with an intense carbonation. The flavor of this beer appears to be a bit subdued, but its dryness is well blended."
"very drinkable"
"Trois Pistoles pours a dark cola color with an average-sized, creamy, light-brown head. The aroma is of rich, dark malts. Dark fruit smell and sweet sugar are most notable. Rich, dark malt taste dominates here. Dark ripe fruit flavor mixes with an earthy malt. Light toasty flavor is also noted. Sugary flavor bursts through every now and then. Just a taste of alcohol is noted in the finish. My words cannot describe delicious and complex of Trois Pistoles. Wow, this is rich, flavorful, awesome, and kinda ""mellow"" like the label states. This is world class and is a ""must sample"" beer."
"Another incredible brew from Unibroue."
"The carbonation was very strong (I almost lost the cork when popping the bottle) and complented the body beautifully. Dark, and still refreshing. A 750 would be easy to polish off alone if no one else wanted any (on second thought, screw them they can have the other beer). I'm going back to the store and grabbing all their bottles of 2004 before I go back to Maryland (Uncultured heard I found some 2004 and demanded some, and I owe him for the Unibroue 11 he shared)."
"The taste was very similar, although the bitter, almost sour yeasty punch that you fel with the first sip fades into a pleasant sweet, dark-malted fruit flavor, all the while maintaining a pretty fizzy champagne-like mouthfel. Very well balanced and full-bodied beer, almost too strong on some of the flavors. Very interesting and another triumph as far as I'm concerned from Unibroue."
"Pours a hazy brown, with some orange, small tan head forms, goes pretty quick but leaves a lace ring around the glass. Smell is sweet, spices, orange, brown sugar, prunes, yeast, and some alcohol. Taste is sweet brown sugar, dates, spices, and orange. Mouthfeel was medium bodied with high carbonation. This one has been cellaring since february so it was pretty smooth, need to bust into my 750 ml of 2004 soon."
"This brew pours an opaque black color. The head is one-finger tall, but recedes quickly into nothing. The aroma is of spices, dark fruits, caramel, and more spices. The taste starts with dark fruits, then gets spicy during the finish, while alcohol coats the throat on the way down and during the aftertaste. The mouthfeel is meium bodied with a lot of (maybe too much) carbonation. Overall, this is a good beer, but not great. I would choose La Terrible or La Maudite over this brew anyday."
"i like what i taste from unibroue, shall try maudite next"
"I could put this away for awhile, but I'd be completely smashed after a few."
"Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: Dam this is good. The beer is full bodied. The carbonation plays nicely with this tasty beer. I wish I had known about Unibroue sooner."
"Opinion: This is an incredible beer! This is probably the only beer that I have tried in recent history that I think would give St Bernardus Abt 12 a run for it's money. The aroma and flavor is rich and complex, and you can notice something new just about every time you raise the glass to drink. I have tried this beer before, but it was after quite a few others before hand. As one of my first beers of the evening, it is much more enjoyable. Take your time with this one."
"The feeling on the mouth is smooth and gentle, not harsh in the least. This is a beer with excellent drinkability and is certainly makes for a nice treat every once in a while."
"Pours a black, opaque color with a tan-colored head. Aromas of raisins, plums, and alcohol come out. The taste is great with a malt flavor upfront followed closely by a plum/dry fruit finish. The ABV is somewhat hidden in the fruity flavors. A sour aftertaste that leaves behind a warming alcohol sensation. Good drinkability."
"Floral. This beer is very flowery. Jasmine, Coriander, andAsparagus? This is very interesting. The bouquet is just grand. Taste is mixed berries with a sweet front that gives way to complex tart oak notes. Jasmine wraps the toungue half way through each sip and gives way to a dry asparagus. The color is a brilliant deep brown with amber hues. The head is fairly thin but lasting. Lacing is decent. Carbonation is exceptionally aggressive. Texture is meaty like a rib eye. Drinkability is flawless. This is a dangerous fellow to dabble with. My taste buds wish to consume far more than my kidneys could bare. Well done."
"A drinkable brew."
"tastes like pleasure. this is good shit, and very drinkable. hard to believe it is 9% abv ! spicy and crisp, buttery on the tongue, awesome. i think i prefer la fin du monde, but i will definitely get this again. yummm"
"Drinkability: Dangerously drinkable."
"Incredibly pour off this beer. Two fingers of deep rubied brown liquid sits below 3 fingers of moderately fast dispersing head. After things settle, I get 2 fingers of an off-white head. Nose is very fruity and spicey. Notes of orange and raisin sit under a coriander spicyness. Touches of brown sugar sweetness come through as well. Flavor is solid. Good sweet raisin soaked in orange juice and brown sugar. Very well blended. No hint of alcohol, which is awesome. Feel is moderate with a moderate carbonation. I'm very impressed with the drinkability of this brew. I'm really not having to take time between sips, as would be expected from the alcohol content. A very good brew."
"I am hooked on belgian ales."
"I really like this beer, a very drinkable dark begium style that hides the achohol very well."
"Overall Impression: A slow sipper to be sure, but a wonderful way to pass an evening. Dont try to slam this one; it needs to be slowly enjoyed. Massively drinkable, I just want more. You have to like the yeast strain to enjoy it, but I do so this is a treat. I could see this one being a nice compliment to turkey, think Ill try to get one for Thanksgiving."
"perfect gourmet beer, double fermentation, depp dark color; like folgers coffe; malt, rum , caramel toasted hops are presentin its smell; taste fruity like bananas, and full bodied; try with cheese, and high cuisine; serve in a classic goblet, or champagne glass; 90% recommended."
"Unibroue Trois Pistoles is a great tasting Belgian strong dark ale but not something to have on a regular day home from work. Instead enjoy this beer with someone who will enjoy a unique Belgian and flavor."
"A very smooth and slick mouthfeel. Nice amount of carbonation. I like this beer a lot. It may be a new fave in the fridge."
" notes: this beer is an event in and of itself a great way to wind down on a weeknight evening. just the cure for pale ale burn out. so far my favorite from unibroue. will get this again...soon"
"The beer pours dark brown with a cloudiness caused by the lees. The nose is old fruit and leather. This is a full bodied beer in the tradition of Rochefort 10. The finish is big and crisp. Aging will soften the big notes and bring into a harmonious focus."
"Poured a nice reddish/brown, small head, tons of lacing thorough out the drink. Scents of malt, sweet caramel. Awesome taste nice and sweet a little bitter at the start, but finishes strong. Medium body. Very drinkable even at the 9% ABV. Another awesome brew from Unibroue."
"All in all, it is a quality beer, as all of Unibroue's offerings are. And for only $6.50, I'd consider it quite a steal. In addition, I love Unibroue's label art... it's just so epic and cheesy, that you have to love it."
"Served in a chalice from a 750ml bottle. Extremely dark brown/ruby color, with almost no head. Aroma is a fruity, malty pleasure. The taste is even better. Sweet, malty, with the big alcohol nicely hidden. This beer goes down wonderfully, especially on cold, rainy nights like tonight. Another classic from Unibroue, my desert island brewery."
"D: Dangerous at this alcohol level."
"quite possibly one of my favorite beers. A little off from Unibroue's typical offering. Much darker than anything else I've tried from them. Would love to try this on tap sometime, but don't see how that's possible without making a trip to Canada. Enjoy!"
"Strong and flavorful, this is some good stuff!"
"I just cannot find anything offensive about this beer.... very well rounded. Another great beer from Unibroue"
"Notes: My favorite dessert beer. In fact, I first tried it last weekend when my sister and I cooked a little beer dinner when she was home visiting from Washington, DC. W paired beers with different copursed. Since we both suck at preparing deserts, the Trois Pistoles was the dessert. I enjoyed it with a nice Don diego cigar and it was a great experience. I highly recommend you try i."
"I had to force myself to sip, because I really wanted the glass to last forever."
"Trios Pistoles is a wonderful beer that can't quite rival the great Westvleteren or Rocheforts but settle in nicely behind the St. Bernardus Abt. 12's and Westmalle's. A joy to drink any day, and for the price a bargin."
"Pours a deep, dark, cloudy brown with an immense, off-white, Nerf-like head. Five minutes later, I was finally able to get the rest of the bottle into the pint glass. Once the head fades to normal levels, 3P is quite a pretty beer. Smells and tastes pretty similar to the North Coast Pranqster I just had: yeast, cloves, citrus. Also: dark fruits, anise, and a touch of mustard? More phenol, and no toastedness here. Extremely sweet. Mouthfeel is nice, but this beer is just a touch too candied for me."
"Carbonation on this one was NUTS. Like a Coke it was. The bubbles burned and made it difficult for my taste buds to appreciate the amazing flavor of this beer. Wayyy overdone. Don't know what happened, but the fizz on this really detracted from the experience. Hope it was just a fluke. I have one more i shall consume at a later date to test..."
"Pours an incredibly dark brown, very close to pitch black with a nice tan head that retains well enough for a 9% beer...looks magnificent in my chimay chalice. Aroma is very nice, dark fruits (grape, plum), sweet candied sugar, some light grassy hops and slight traces of phenols. Flavor is very complex, notes of ripe grape and plum, spices (corriander and black pepper), dry grassy hops flavor and a sweet candied sugar flavor. Extremely well balanced, complex and delicious, and a bargain at $1.75 for a 12oz single. Mouthfeel is suprisingly light for the style but makes it very drinkable, with moderate carbonation."
"Poured this beer into a chalice style glass. Nice thin head with a dark ruby red clolor. Smell was very much like chocolate and plums. The taste was amazing smooth for the alchol content. Very well hidden for a 9%abv beer. Very light in the hops and very smooth finish make this beer a true winner."
"D = Pretty good. Its a bit expensive though."
"Kind of a heavy beer to have more that one or two of, but very good."
"poured a deep brown color with foamy tan head. Some particles of yeast notes. Smell is deeply fruity with prunes, rainins, figs noted. Also a hint of burning wood. Taste is absolutely suberp with toasted malt, prunes, raisins and all sorts of things that I can't describe but that taste great. Finished fantastically pleasant with no nint of alcohol present. This is a mighty beer."
"Although the 9% strength prevents this being a session beer, a single bottle is a beautiful companion on a cool fall day, sipped slowly, enjoyed through all its changing character as it warms."
"D - Nice. Goes down really easily, could be drank all night, just like all other Unibroue beers I've tried. They seem pretty good at that. Delicious, would pair well with foods."
"Pours a murky, dark, cloudy, rusty mahogany that only allows the faintest light to pass through the edges below a sturdy off-white head that vanishes under the 9% abv weight. Smell is...well, Belgian...dark fruits, sweet malts, a bit of olive. Taste....wow....starts off like a good Belgian dark, plums and raisins abound, but instead of the funky, alcoholic olive aftertaste I've grown accustomed to in a Belgian, I was greated with a sweet, crisp fruity/malty aftertaste that really sat well with me. Very subtle, but that's why it's so brilliant and mysterious. Mouthfeel is crisp and refreshing, drinkable to no end. This beer really crept up on me. Its unassuming start transitioned into a real treat. This beer somehow makes it into my top three all-time. Kudos, Canada."
"This isn't the kind of beer that you can just swig back at random. More of a sipping beverage, plan for this to last awhile. While it is interesting, I didn't really find it very refreshing. I was actually quite tired of it by the time I got through the bottle (I'm glad it wasn't a big one)."
"overall- very well balanced and smooth flavor. after taste is a bit strong and lingering, but it doesnt hurt it to much. very refreshing depsite the 9%. Ide save this stuff for a special occasion or something of that nature. drinkability might go up if you pair it with a good meal to even things out"
"Pours black with a very thick frothy tan head. Smells like sweet berries with just a faint hint of yeast and alcohol. Taste is initially roasted malt with lots of fruit complexity. The taste lingers for a while - very nice finish. There is also a little bit of yeatiness present but very little sign of alcohol except for the pleasant warming effect. This has a very good mouthfeel. It's heavy and creamy. Coats the mouth and is a joy to drink from my goblet - that wonderful head persists forever. This is quite tastey but it's not stuff I would want to drink all night. Definitely needs to warm up a bit for all it's flavors to come through."
"Dark fruits and yeasty up front with a heavy malt backbone.. Metallic/medicinal evident and was unfortunate but it was subtle and not disturbing. Warming alcohol smell was evident (bonus). Unibroue brings us some fine brews. I guess Canada is actually worth having around as long as this brewery is alive and well."
"This beer has become one of my favorites. What an amazing beer! Pours a very dark brown with a light tan head. Smells incredibley sweet. Immediatley recognized some nice plum and prevelant cherry aromas. Nice light chocolate character that seemed to be wrapped in the sweet fruity flavors of the plum and cherry with a bit of a tartness that sits on your tongue and stays on its way down. Malty, yeasty, and delicious."
"Taste is quite malty and yeasty. Lightly tart apple and plum. Vanilla, spicy like pepper and coriander. Lightly bitter in the finish. Mouth is rich and lightly sticky. Good stuff, I can never do the Unibroue beers justice with my words."
"Dark color, very decent head, foamy with bubbles. Sweet smell, malt, and a touch of caramel and fruits. Amazing taste, thick mouthfeel but not execive, the alcohol is very well hidden behind the sweet flavor. Caramel, a little bit of chocolate and the fruity-like flavor make this beer really desirable. The flavor stays in your mouth for a while letting you remeber the complexity of the beer you have just tasted."
"Brownish purple in colour, with a fair amount of carbonation. Lots of yeast, spice, and dark berry fruits on the nose. Very yeasty flavor profile as well, with the fruits taking on a sour note. The syrupy raisin malt favors were balanced out well by the carbonation.I was expecting it to be a bit more ""port like", but this is still great. Very mellow indeed."
"Poured into a tulip glass, lots of foamy head. A creamy quality that doesn't dissipate. The taste is sweet candi sugar and malt. There is a fruity twang to the aftertaste, which stays with you for some time. I believe that due to the aftertaste the mouthfeel suffers a little. The alcohol is there, though it is not up front. I can enjoy about two of these at a sitting and then I'm done!"
"Pours a lovely brown. By this time, the head is kicking up pretty frothily, understandably. Has a great taste that to me gave just a light impression of cherries, likely from the yeast. Also a well-balanced spiciness that stays in the background for support. Overall great malty taste. This probably wasnt the best condition for trying it out in, but it held up very well. I even filled a growler for later!"
"Overall, I'm not quite as impressed with this one as I was with Maudite or Fin du Monde. Great brew regardless."
"Notes: Exceptional, I love this stuff. It's a staple in my fridge."
"Update, actually for my own notes on 6/7/2013 - my wife didn't care for it, the spices were too strong and it had a bitter finish bite to her that made it difficult to drink. I did not edit anything from the original review in 2005, but I think it is a bit thinner than noted in my original review. I guess the rest is pretty much the same."
"Overall: I felt like this beer was just turned down a smige from the true belgian classics like St. Bernardus and Westy. The taste smell and mouthfeel were all just slightly below those two, but I would put this right behind those two, and that's saying a lot. This is definitely a beer I will have again and again."
"I could drink this one anytime, but I live in México and the weather is always a factor. Trois Pistoles is more for my winters, when the temperature drops maybe to the lower 40s (the last 15 days the minimum was 72° early one morning and highs around 110°)."
"This one is a good beer, but nothing in the flavor department really stands out to make it a unique brew."
"The carbonation is plentiful, which I personally enjoy, and plays on your palate, adding a necessary lightness to this otherwise sweet and slightly heavy beer. Completely adds balance to it. Helps the drinkability factor, and makes each sip burst on your tongue. A sweet treat."
"750 ml bottle. 2004 stenciled on bottle."
"Slightly bitter at first. This beer is warming up! Carmel flavors are coming alive on the second glass. I just raised taste from 3.5 ro 4.0. Yeehaw!"
"Trois Pistoles has always been my favourite of the Unibroue labels; a true work of art, and somehow nothing less would do for this beer. Classy, elegant, with an almost sacred air surrounding these bottles of Trois Pistoles. In the glass TP is a very dark, almost deep purple colour. Held to a light it is dark brown. It looks thick and inpenetrable, appearing black from a distance. The head is light beige and brown, leaving large bubbles of lace. The head from this particular bottle was not that large, and actually I have found the head a little inconsistent for TP, but this is still a magnificent looking beer. The aroma is musty and exceptionally complex. From above the rim I can detect some maltiness mixed with charcoal and black licorice. In closer is where all the fruitiness exists, and the detectable but not overpowering phenols. Red grapes, grapejuice, black currants, figs, dark malts and alcohol, baking bread, and a great balance of sweetness; a sugariness that is always there, but very subtle and a little hard to coax out of it. The website mentions aromas of chocolate, but I get very little, if any chocolate smells. Similar yeast aromas to the other Unibroues. I get red apples and faint pear aromas as well. Swirling the glass releases some saltiness, like a seasoning. The aroma is also quite spicy if you sniff close enough, and that combined with the 9% really can tickle the nose, and numb it. As it warmed I started to smell soil in the aroma. Taste at first is dusty sweetness of dark malt. Again I get a lot of grape taste up front, more fruits, horehound candy, and mollasses. The alcohol makes it presence known fairly rapidly, and it definitely lingers in the aftertaste. The finish also gives some cream and iron metallic tastes. The taste to me is much like a fortified grapejuice, but not exactly wine-like, because it is too sweet. There are definitely some cabernet or merlot flavours though, along with a little bitterness akin to tannins. And I do mean little: even for the style this possesses very little dryness. Full bodied and warming. Despite the volume of alcohol, very drinkable and absolutely stunning as an after dinner drink with a rich, sweet dessert. A beer that lives up to its label. This is a brew I love to introduce to people as one of Canada's best craft beers."
"The beer isn't as dry as the La Fin Du Monde. Very impressive creamy mouthfeel, though. Also provides a great residual sugar taste in the finish. Drinkability is extraordinarily high considering this brew is so extraordinarily high in alcohol (which is quite well hidden by the way)."
"4/26/04: Reddish auburn with a light beige head that sticks around for a minute before receding to a lacing. Smell screams unibroue with that house yeast of their's contributing great esters and phenolics. Also big are raisins, chocolate, and coriander. Plummy in the flavor with a very smooth long finish. Feels good, the carbonation bites just a bit on the sides of the tongue. A gorgeous beer, and almost too easy to drink."
"Decent mouthfeel which is a little on the lighter side as well. I did find this beer to be very drinkable however. I finished off the 750 ml fairly quick and could definitely go for another."
"Overall, I think this is a really nice beer, one that I will probably buy again. It certainly makes me want to try other Belgians. But the three I've got left in my closet will likely last me a little while, as I don't intend to drink these too terribly often. Your wine-drinking friends might find this to be an ""in"" to good beer, however."
"Drinkable? Oh, yeah.This mighty brew beat down the flavors from a smoked salmon chowder and came bursting through in the tastebuds. It is a definite contenda and should be exhulted with the other big Belgians out there."
"Very enjoyable. Beyond the appearance, its all-around tremendous. Its as 'terrible' as La Terrible as far as Unibroue is concerned."
"Carbonation introduces the palate to a multitude of flavors. Taste hints at sweet fruit. Alcohol warms the face and the spicyness of the brew. Not overbearing, but well balanced for a brew of this potency. Another Unibroue gem."
"Poured out to a dark amber red color with a nice head. Medium to medium/low carbonation. Aroma of dark fruit, spices and herbs were most present. Flavor was complex, with overtones of fruit, cocoa, spice and burnt brown sugar. Very nice. Thick mouthfeel, like i'm almost drinking thin pancake syrup. Finished smooth with a nice sweet smoke aftertaste. Nice brew from Unibroue. Wouldn't drink more than one in a sitting, as it goes down a bit on the heavy side. Nevertheless, a good beer. Recommended."
"A fountain soon after the cap is popped. Body is dark brown, making this almost impenetrable to light. Not much of a head, just a small ring around the glass, with an uneven layer in the middle. Smell is fruity and dark, with rum and raisin present. Taste is crisp and murky, with a good amount of hops, and dark fruit flavors abounding. Crisp mouthfeel, with good hops and body. An excellent beer with lots of unique character. There are better offerings from Unibroue."
"Notes: Im not terribly impressed. Ive tried a few strong dark Belgians and I have mixed feelings. This has a bit of a sour aftertaste. Not sure what to make of that."
"I would say that the body is the strongest attribute. I am also surprised at the lack of apparent alcohol, although this ale has 9% content."
"Drinkability and Overall: This beer is roughly 6 months old, and it's wonderful now, but I had one recently that was just over 2 years old and it was superb. The best state it's been in. I can't wait till this gets older."
"Ut Vivat, Crescat, Floreat!"
"This is pretty drinkable given the alcohol content, thinkness and complexity. Definitely a slow sipping beer of course. And given the slightly cloying sweetness, I'm not very interested in more than one at this point. Perhaps this bottle was a little off??? Or maybe it needed to age a little more? I'll try another one in a year or so to give it (and myself) another chance."
"Drinkability: It's a good beer, but, IMO, it's not that exciting. I'll admit it's hard to believe it's 9%; the alcohol is very well concealed. Otherwise, a bit light-bodied for a BSDA and tad bland -- not their best."
"A lovely beer all around. I'm thinking paired best with beef or pasta. would make a great winter warmer."
"Really nice mouthfeel. Light carbonation and a smooth creamy body. I could go for another one once I'm done. I'll grab another bottle soon I'm sure."
"Slàinte!"
"Poured a rich dark reddish brown with an offwhite head the writhed a frothed for awhile then it settled into a thick creamy layer of tan foam. The aroma was alcoholic with a clovey spicyness and a touch of dark fruit. The flavor was very dry in the malt department with a very nice fruity flavor and a spicy undertone that finished very clean. The mouthfeel was of an average viscosity for a brew of this high of a gravity and the carbonation was soft yet lent a bit of a refreshing sharpness though not as clean in the finish as maudite. Nice beer to have at the end of the night however if i was given the choice I would probably go for a maudite instead."
"Cracking the bottle and decanting into my tulip leaves me with a beautiful ale, potent in appearance. Color at first appears black, with a dominating white head. Further inspection reveals the hue to be closer to a very dark brownish garnet. Powerful estery aroma of blended tropical and dark fruits, a zing of citrous hops, and a little bready malt. Slight wine-like character to the nose. Taste is an interesting blend of dark and light malts, slight breadiness and yeastiness. Nice dark fruits and berries in the flavor, think red wine with lots of malt. The more this beer warms, the more wine-like qualities come out - very tasty. Zesty hops tantalize the tongue with orange peels and lemons. Hops come in big and bold, but aren't able to dominate the huge malt bill. The hops relinquish their hold on your palate; the flavor moving back to huge creamy malt with a little bread and some alcohol. Finish is has some chewy malt, and is slightly acidic, but is mostly dry and vinous. Wickedly drinkably and devilishly delicious."
"Excellent beer. One to keep around."
"The finish is clean with a sinful saison-like fade of yeast. Wow!"
"This introduction to the Unibroue line of beers continues to be impressive. Trois Pistoles is labeled as dark and strong. They're not lying. Pours a deep blood red, very dark. Smells of plums and brandy, the most pungent aspect is the overpowering alcohol smell-not a bad thing! Taste is pretty typical of a bottle-conditioned ale, musty, tart but sweet. Sickly ale all-round a very strong, not a beer to be taken lightly."
"Comments - This beer is better than I remember. Recommended. Thank you, Canada, for producing Unibroue. Let us all hops that Sleeman does not screw this up."
"Overall, this is an excellent beer of great quality, and great to drink (in small quantities)."
"D- This is a nice beer but it doesn't have the malt complexity or the alcoholic warmth that I would expect from this style."
"Lke another Unibroue ale that I had this evening, I enjoyed this with cambozola and lox. It's a finely suited beer to pair with any pungent cheese."
"Unibroue is slowly becoming one of my favorite breweries, and this Trois Pistoles is only perpetuating this. Can't wait to try more and more, and luckily at Carytown Wine and Beer they have a fantastic selection of their products."
"Deep brown ruby pour with a big white head and some yeast. Very complex smell. Lots of dark malty fruit and winey aromas. Grassy notes in the scent as well. Cherry flavors with lots of spice to go with a dry mouthfeel. ABV is high but well hidden, and it can sneak up on your pretty quickly. This is my first Unibroue brew, and I'm really impressed. The flavor is so complex and deep, and the aftertaste, which the bottle describes as port, is pleasant and lingering. A great selection."
"By itself I'd say the drinkability is a 4 or less, but paired with the proper food this could be ambrosia."
"There was a great texture to this brew. The mouthfeel captured the attention before the taste was even considered. Nectar like. Pleasantly sweet and juicey with a cream and nut oil finish. Oh and the taste; superb. The spice aspects of the nose were a touch threatening, but did not offend in the taste. Mildly caramel and dark fruit sweetness remained mellow without throwing their respective weights about. The well administered spice character showed up in the latter stages of the flavor revelation. Very nicely crafted. The taste showed itself and departed without lingering or pestering. The lack of aftertaste prompted rapid sipping in an attempt to keep the flavor constantly atop the tastebuds. More, more, more! Good trick by my brothers to the north. Bravo!"
"Oh my god...this is 9% ABV? This stuff is evil, because you don't notice it until it bites you on the behind. Even though I served it too cold at first it was still a taste explosion which obviously improved as it warmed up. Pours from the bottle murky brown with reasonable light tan head. Aroma of raisins and brown sugar which extended through to the flavour along with hints of bitter dark chocolate towards the end. Luxurious mouthfeel, with a hint of viscosity from the high alcohol. I think I have fallen in love with Belgian Dark Brown Ale."
"This beer pours an amber color with a tan, creamy head that never seams to fade. It leaves a thick lacing on the glass. It smells malty. It smells of fruit. Cherries and rasberries. There are hints of vanilla also. It tastes fruity. There are hints of chocolate also. Almost like mild chocolate covered cherries. It is carbonated a bit much in my opinion. It is a meadium bodied beer. It leaves a fruity aftertaste on the palate. This beer is not the best session beer due to the somewhat high alcohol content, and because it is too carbonated. It is definatley worth a shot though."
"These flavors abound in the first sip. Further dark fruits are revealed. Plenty of clove and allspice sweetness, brown sugar, plum-pudding, and banana. On the sweet side, but not overly so. Absolutely smooth and highly drinkable. A silky body and a spicy, yeasty finish remind me why I love this beer. Top notch."
"This is an absolute beauty. What else can I say? Highly recommended."
"The last time I had this was New Year's 2 years ago, and I questioned my palate in hindsite. I've got to learn to trust my inebriated taste buds, just not my inebriated judgement as a whole."
"Despite the high abv that sneaks right up on you, this one is very drinkable. I often have to pace myself when enjoying this one, my taste buds want more!"
"In the goblet Trois Pistoles is almost black beneath its tall head of frothy bone-white foam. If you tilt the glass you can see tiny bubbles steadily streaming upwards, adding to it's head, and helping with its retention. Lacing about the glass, however, is a bit more limited than might be expected given the head retention. In the nose dark fruits greet you (not unlike port wine in many ways). It's initially zesty in the mouth before it warms a bit, but it still leaves with a bit of a zing until it warms a bit and becomes more airy. The flavor is drenched in soft, tanninc dark fruit that's been dipped in liquid sugar; but it's not particularily complex. As it warms, however, more caramel notes and some subtle hops become apparent, as does a touch of spicy alcohol (and some actual spice perhaps?) and some very low-key notes of licorice or soft molasses. It's really well balanced, with it's spicy alcohol and delicate bitterness balancing the dark fruits and restrained sugars. It's really quite enticing in that it's flavors are somewhat restrained and ""mellow"" as the back label suggests. This is a beer to be savored slowly, enjoying it's subtle complexities as they emerge. Magnifique!!!"
"An excellent late-night beer from Unibroue. It seems they just cannot brew anything that's less than wonderful."
"All in all, an impressive offering from Unibroue."
"Dark cloudy chestnut color, some mohogany edges. Thick foamy white head, disappears eventually. Not much lace on the sides of the Unibroue goblet. Strong dark fruity smells, along with yeasty spices, almost like corriander. Caramel flavor, along with spices. Ripe fruit, dark fruit. Pretty carbonated, medium body. A very interesting beer. Some funkiness along with it. Interesting. Not the most drinkable, but a good one to try."
"Drinkability: hell yes!!! This is a great example of this style, I highly recommend this brew, for that matter, this brewery."
"Beautiful purple-black with a thin head that has the same subtle purplish tones. Huge aroma consisting of grapes and other ripe fruits. Very complex. Taste is grapes, peaches, caramel malts, becoming sweeter and more alcoholic as it warms. It might sound funny but I always get this mental image of purple (grape) Laffy Taffy when I drink this beer, I guess due to the fruits and candy sweetness. Very well carbonated and a great winelike aftertaste. One of my favorites."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable for a 9% ABV beer. Probably dangerously so. Very good."
"Pours a deep, mahogany red body, cloudy from the yeast, and a big, off white head. Nice lacing, great looking beer. Aroma of prunes, dark fruit, yeast, caramel, cherries, and a slight medicinal flavour. Taste is wonderful. So juicy, and full of fruit. Plums, prunes, caramel. Deceptive alcohol. Great balance with some hops in the background. Truly a well crafted ale."
"Tasted awsome (as if it wouldn't). All the aromas tranferred to the pallate, followed by the evident alcohol of 9%abv, and a spritzy mouthfeel from the carbonation. Very easy to drink, and as usual, a winner for me!"
"This is one of those dark, wonderful ales that you should surprise guests with by serving at a party in lieu of wine. It would go great with red meat. And hell, you can get a 750 ml bottle of this for much less than a bottle of good wine--and this is better than good wine."
"Would be an excellent accompaniment to a meal. A fine, fine brew."
"A heavy hitter that doesn't taste like one. Could drink this every day."
"Got this botle in Holland and didn't know what to expect from this one.... well after pulling it out you notice as soon as your nose gets near the the beer that this is somthing great! Very fruity, hoppy( is it saaz?) don't make you think that this is a strong dark ale. Hardly anything to motice of the 9% and hardly any maltarome in the nose. Nice darkbrown colour and a lasting head. Then the first sip... this brew tastes fullmaly, caramellic and only litle roast( is there?). Not to sweet but full and almost the same aftertaste. Wonder how so litle bitterness gets such a great hoparome.... must be dryhops in there! Good beer I will go for again when I find it...."
"This is a great beer, a true classic, and always fun to pick out the flavours."
"Big head on this one sit atop a dark ruby beer. After I got through the head the smell of this is fruity of cherries and grapes spiced with pepper and a lurking malty sweetness. This beer is a mouthful even at a sip. Highly carbonated and full bodied. It has a taste the flood over the tongue and gives you spicey notes of yeast that fade to fruity malt sweetness and end with a lingering aftertaste that reminds you to drink more. The alcohol hides well in this dark Canadian treat."
"Drinkability- As of now it's extremely drinkable. All depends on how the alcohol makes me feel after I finish it. 2 thumbs up, and not far from being a bit better."
"Big props to my buddy Paul for this one! Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a tulip glass. Nice presentation here. Very dark black/ruby color to it with a 1-finger head. I love the aroma this beer gives off. The first thing I noticed were apples and pears followed by bananas and then a hint of dark chocolate. Nice and complex. Overall, very fruity aroma. Some of the fruitiness disappeared upon tasting it and it transformed into a nice, subtle, malty brew. A slightly sweet finish. I could drink this baby all night long, but it is a bit of a sipper. Very enjoyable and highly recommended. Cheers!"
"Alcohol is well hidden, and it sneaks up on you."
"Drinkablity is very good, goes down especially easy for a 9% beer, in fact I'm glad I got the 750ml so I can go get another glass. Highly recommend this one."
"Not a bad beer. I haven't had too many nor liked high abv brews but this is ok stuff."
"I haven't had the pleasure to try this beer from the 750 ml bottle yet, so this is from the 341ml bottle. It pours a dark brown colour with big off white head. The head disappears rather fast though. It has a lovely smell of molasses and raisins. The taste is a little bitter. Fruity and malty but balaced. The mouthfeel is very smooth and you get a warming feeling from the 9% ABV. The aftertaste is a bit sweet and malty. This lovely beer made me warm on a cold November night."
"This definitely could be the sole beer for a whole evening. It's a bit much for everyday, but there's a reason that this one's on my short list."
"This is one hell of a Unibroue beer. This sample is a one and a half year old 750 ml corked bottle. It pours dark chocolate brown color with a massive khaki billowy head that leaves sheets of thick lace. The aroma is of intense plums, raisinbread, caramel dates, passionfruit and green apple skins, with a generous spicey hop character. The taste is an impeccable mix of pale, crystal and roasted malts. Theres a great, bready flavor, A caramelly flavor and a toasted malt flavor. Theres also a fruity yeast flavor. Hops are evident but rightly subdued, This is a malt beer. The mouthfeel is very smooth with torrents of tiny carbonation bubbles. The finish is quite crisp and also bitter, surprisingly so. This is one hell of a good Belgian style beer. A must try."
"The taste is pretty amazing. The blending of all the flavor components is excellently done, very balanced. Flavors encompass the sweet malts which were detected in the aroma. A blendy of dark fruits, mainly subdued raisin and plums. The immediate aftertaste is very crisp. The aftertaste doesn't last long though, I'd like it to stick around a bit to savor the flavor, but I'm sure this is due to the high ABV of this beer. Even with the 9% content this brew goes down nice and smooth. Perfect for sitting around one cool evening to savor the flavor and be warmed up a bit."
"Excellent beer to sip at and enjoy."
"Pours a rich, slightly cloudy, dark copper and brown. Very little head that quickly dissipates, leaving a thin film of lace. Dark, sweet, raisin and cherry fruit and alcohol aromas. Rich, roasted malt and dark fruits in the mouth with an excellent, slightly bitter and very dry finish that leaves you wanting more. A medium-heavy body that seems very appropriate for the style. An excellent interpretation of the style, and a beer I'd be happy to sip for a few hours after dinner."
"Rich mahogany foams to a narrow cream, with a nose somewhat off-balance: sugar and spice tones brimming on alcohol. First taste is rich pure beer notes and bountiful, with a middle proliferation of Dolcetto esters maturing into thicker, dark fruit; a deeply hidden but powerful bitter is subdued underneath a late-blooming verge of Godiva. The body royals in purple, finishing superbly complete--skeining tan lace."
"Mouthfeel is good as well. A nice full body that coats the mouth and goes down smooth. Drinkability is nice here too. Not a session brew, but a couple on a cold night would be nice. I'm looking forward to trying more Unibroue products."
"Drinkability is good but I would rather split this with 3 or maybe 4 people as it gets a bit filling. Would be an excellent choice to pair with dessert."
"Overall, this is a substantial and delicious Belgian dark, with plenty of complexity and an intriguing finish."
"Pours a beautiful cinnamon brown color with a nice frothy head that shrinks to a constant miniscule lacy head skirting the edge of the liquid. The aroma I could inhale all day: Molasses, figs, raisins, clove, chocolate, cinammon. It almost shares an aroma profile with a dopplebock, or dare I say an eisbock. The taste reveals a very vinous quality, but like a good sherry or port. The palate is inundated with chocolate and molasses and raisins, just a beautiful sensation that I want to envelop me. Really, this is like liquid chocolate-covered raisins. There is a slight roasty aftertaste that brings just enough bitterness to the table to keep this from being cloying. The mouthfeel is stout and the carbonation is just wonderful if not a bit filling, coating every corner of the tongue. The drinkability is exceptional as the alcohol content is well-masked. Ohhhh, I want another. Unibroue makes good beer, and that's all there is to it."
"Although I could drink this all day, and probably will, I must admit that the first Unibroue in a night is usually the best. This is a slow sipping beer."
"12 oz. bottle with twist-off bottlecap under silver foil dated best before 1-28-2007. Pours a murky ruby with brown highlights, sometimes bordering voilet hues. Roasted malts, yeast, various spices (I discerned some cinnamon, ginger and cardamum), and a currant-like fruitiness are evident in the nose. Roasted candi sugar and malts are upfront, followed by a grape/currant-like fruitiness and backed with a healthy dosage of yeastiness and hops to keep it dry and palatable in the finish. Not bad; I'd like to try it in the 75 cl presentation. The alcohol is noticable, but barely. A slight bit of burnt cideriness at the end of the goblet."
"Appearance was a murky cedar water color with a thin, light tan head. Aroma was ripe fruits and cloves. Taste was spicy and fruity with a nice, smooth finish and only slightly bitter... I would've liked it to be more complex. Carbonation was solid. Medium mouthfeel. The higher ABV was very noticeable and warming was felt almost immediately. For me, this was just an average Belgian ale that never reached me and not Unibroue's best offering."
"Deep soil brown colored beer with a cream colored head. Head is on the small side, almost creamy in texture, and leaves a sheet of lace as it fades slowly to a scatered film. Aromas of brown sugar, dark fruit (plums and apples?, I can't figure it out) and a bit of yeasty goodness. Dark fruits, raisins and plums, some cocoa, dark candied sugar, and possibly some other stuff. There's a bit going on in there and it's hard to seperate out. Finish is smooth and lingers for a while drawing you back for more. Moderate bodied beer is smooth on the tongue. Yeah she's a nice one, getting close to that Abt 12 (St. B's of course)."
"I thought I might as well review this, before it gets stolen. Pours a dark caramel colour, with a bit of chocolate black. Yeast gives it a clouded, almost spooky colour. Big, two finger head that's thick and strong. Lace sticks to the glass like post-it notes. Big smell of cherries, alcohol, chocolate, plums, raisins, malts and dark chocolate. Taste is a bit more subdued. The above ingredients make a thick sweetness that is balanced by, of all things, the alcohol. Instead of hops for balancing the sweet, this beer relies on the kick of the alcohol. It works well. Mouthfeel is dry and has an oatmeal thickness that's a bit unexpected in anything liquid. Good drinkability. Would be nice on a winter afternoon, sipped like brandy."
"Very nice. Poured darker than I would have expected it to. Poured a cloudy reddish brown like tea with too much lemon juice in it. Nice colour. Monster slightly off-white head that settled to a little more than a thin haze over the top. Laced the sides of the glass quite nicely. The smell was just as good as everyone said it would be. The presence of alcohol is certainly detectable, but not overpowering. A little bit of spice and malt. Very pleasant; I couldn't wait to have a sip. The taste, too, has some spice to it and plenty of malt. There is no question that this is a higher gravity brew. Certainly not unpleasant, but there is indeed a warming affect from the 9.0%abv. Would be absolutely ideal for a cold winter night. The mouthfeel is nice and smooth and it goes down easily. There is some carbonation present, but a pleasant amount; just a little bit more than a trace. Overall, I'd say I'm quite impressed with this one. Excellent!"
"A value beer."
"Nice one..."
"Comes in a 750ml corked bottle. Best before date is clearly labled. Pours a dark, deep brown, ruby when held to the light. Very subtle head, very low carbonation. Smell is musty and fruity. Taste is malty, dry and grape-like. Like the label advertises, this is port wine-like in taste. Very smooth, and very drinkable. A good showing by Unibrue."
"This is a deep, complex beer that begs one to continue to drink it to try to figure it out. A fine offering from Unibroue, and one that definitely can be enjoyed right up to its best before date if cellared properly."
"Drinkability: This is such an intensly quaffable beer. I don't know how else to describe it."
"I know I emphasized the wine-like qualities, but its not overpowering in that department as I dont like most wine but loved this bad boy. Like my other Unibroue fave, Maudite, this one is complicated in the flavor department and well worth a try."
"Very dark ruby, almost brown. Pours with a delicate head of foam that leaves some nice lacework as it falls. The delightful aroma is full of plum and fig with a hint of smoke. A bit uneventful up front and not very complex, quite thin in body and overly carbonated (reflected in low points for drinkability and mouthfeel.) Hints of tobacco are hidden behind the sharp, prickly carbonation. The finish is powerful, laced with sugar and rum-like flavors, bit of tobacco and smoke, quite complex. There's some interesting stuff going on in this beer. Unfortunately, most Unibroue beers are way too spritzy for my tastes; I usually have to decant them a couple of times into a pint glass to release a lot of the carbonation, which vastly imporoves my ability to enoy this beer. My wife used to go to Key West each year and was astonished to find Unibroue beers at the corner liquor store by her motel. She has a theory that the champagne-like carbonation of the Unibroue beers makes them more appealing to drinkers in tropical climates."
"As with most Unibroue products Trois Pistoles is dangerously drinkable as the sweet, fruity taste hooks you in. Definitely a tasty beer."
"The spices threw me off a bit on this one, but they really do add to the flavor. Not a beer I jumped in and loved right away (this is actually the last bottle of a four-pack I bought about a month ago), but it does grow on you. On my 'to drink again' list."
"well done!"
"I am enjoying the Belgian strong dark ales. They are different and very tasty."
"This was the first Unibroue I ever tried and I'm still drinking it over a year later, so drinkability is good for me. Nice."
"The bottle art is your first indication that this is a beer to be reckoned with. A menacing looking winged horse hovers in the storm clouds over a very dark castle (or is it a church?)--it is very eerie. The beer pours out dark brown, like used motor oil, but leaves a nice but short lived head. Verry little lacing to speak of, but lots of carbonation and light fizz. Smell is fruity, fresh and floral. Taste is nothing short of remarkable. It is sweet and just slightly tangy, light on the palate and smooth. I taste some strawberry in there, some ripe plums and maybe some mulberry. The bottle says that there is ""a pleasant aftertaste that lingers on like old port wine"". It does leave a nice aftertaste, but it is smoother than any port wine I have ever had. A remarkable beer in every regard, highly recommended."
"Note: 750 mL bottle, best before 7-15-06"
"Drinkability/notes: An absolutely superb winter or dessert beer. This would be a stunning finish to a fine meal."
"I know I'm a newbie but this has been one of the greatest beer experiances of my life... and it is still going on... I have only finished half the bottle. Now leave us alone, I have fallen in love"
"Poured a deep brown in my chalice, with a perfect, 2 finger, tan, head. The head dissipated quickly with light lacing left. Smell was cherries, malt, a hint of chocolate and finished with a soft alcohol bite. Tasted was exceptional! Fruity, with a malty backbone and high carbonation. I must confess, I am usually not a big fan of high carbonation, but it worked here!! Finishes crisp and clean, and as usual for Unibroue, the alcohol is well hidden. I could drink several of these at a sitting, but I would stop short of calling this a session beer. Another outstanding offering from Unibroue, I think this is my favorite from them."
"You've been warned. ;)"
"Smooth in the mouth but has a mildy aggressive carbonation; nothing to complain about though. Good all around; warms your insides and pleases the palate."
"This 750ml bottle will probably be all I have tonight. This is a pretty complex beer I will say. Looks like wine until you see the bubbles. Still might be hard to have too many but what I'm having will drink fine....and yeah it goes pretty good with this dessert."
"The tartness of Belgians always makes me knock Belgians a couple points, and this one is no exception, but the rest of it is so well balanced between sweetness and sourness that I have to rate it highly on every other element. A very good beer!"
"Pours a deep amber color with a tanish, light brown head that is not that thick or long lasting. The aroma is dominated by concentrated fruit aromas (cherry, fig, and raisin). There is a hint of alcohol and notes of spice cake also found in the nose. This is fairly light bodied given the intense fruit aromas that are in the aroma. The alcohol is evident in the light burn as it reaches my stomach. There is a hint of coriander in the finish. The fruit notes of raisin and fig are here in the taste as well, but they are not as intense as the aroma would suggest. The finish is fairly dry, though it is lightly sweet up front, which helps to accentuate the fruit notes. Definitely an elegant brew, pretty subtle and I can imagine that some age brings some added complexity to this brew. I'll have to stash a few to see how they age."
"I have had this unibroue offering from bottle before but recently the best local beer bar (Pazzo's) got this on tap and I had to oblige myself. The high alcohol content is a real attractor for many, apparently. The beer pours relatively dark, looking like a bock in the pitcher with a relatively thick carbonation head on top of it. The beer tastes somewhat minty but is very complex and covers up the alcohol excellently. It drinks quickly and smoothly, one could easily have several of these. This is absolutely my favorite unibroue offering and I recommend it to anyone who likes Unibroue or high alcohol beers."
"no lacing at all. color is to my liking. head is all fizzy and loud. strong fruit smell. taste is different. very complex. don't know where to begin. definently a strong alcohol taste but there is something in the rest of it that makes this taste seem justified and right where it should be. there is alot going on in this beer. you don't realize how smooth of a ride it is until the drink is done."
"($2.33 / 12 oz.)"
"12 ounce bottle. Pours dark brownish, plumlike. Off white head, Tad of lacing. Big nose of cherries, must and malt. Malty, Full flavor Belgian style ale. Notes of raisins, cherries, chocolate, musty stuff. Not for beginners, this is a classy, powerful rendition of the style, get out the stinky cheese and enjoy this sipper."
"The beer pours a dark brownish color with a thick frothy off-white head. The aroma is awesome! It has a nice malty scent that is complimented with a fruity Belgian yeast aroma. It is very sweet and refreshing. The taste is very good. It has a rich and intense malt complexity. It has a toasted malt flavor that goes down easy and finishes dry and a bit fruity due to the Belgian yeast. It has great flavor. It has a dark beer taste, but without the black malts. The mouthfeel is excellent. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a damn good brew. These guys only produce winners."
"I'd say this beer is realy right on for a Dubbel, but I'm not super familiar with the Strong Dark ale, but I think its a little thin compared to a Gulden Draak say."
"When I opened this attractive foil covered 12 oz. bottle, the beer gushed out and kept coming. The body is reddish brown and opaque when held up to the light. The head was a couple of inches tall at first, but died down pretty soon. Minimal lacing, which I presume is due to the high ABV. The nose is apples, pears, bananas, and other assorted fruits. Taste is cherries, raisins, plums, and toffee. There was a strong medicinal alcohol presence that reminded me of cough syrup, which is good, since I am battling sinus trouble as I write this. This is a complex brew that I will be looking out for, when it becomes available locally."
"Pours dark amber with a thin off-white head - crackled and popped nicely as it settled into the glass. Aroma of very sweet fruit, especially strawberry creme, countered by a vinegar presence, and even some wacky meat-like character - pot roasty. The taste is initially sweet and fruity, giving way to a huge mouthful of earthy wood-like flavor. Intense full mouth with an easy buttery aftertaste feel. The complex flavors in this brew kept me thinking - an excellent drinking experience. Will definately enjoy again -"
"A solid beer that was good, but not outstanding. Hides the alcohol very, very well."
"Goes down extremely easy. I'm gonna drink plenty of this stuff. I would have never guessed this stuff is sitting at 9%abv. The alcohol is barely present in the taste. Very good stuff."
"Poured out a brownish/amber color with a little bit of carbonation in it. Aroma consisted of a lot of ripe fruit with some malts mixed in. A little wiff of some grapes and rum mixed in as well. Very nice. Taste was pretty much the same as the aroma. Also some earthy tones kinda came into the middle I've noticed with some ever so slighty spicy taste for good measure. The only complaint I have is that it's a little too thin. But other than that it's an exceptional beer."
"Drinkability: Dangerously drinkable, given the alcohol content. I can, and have, thrown back 3 or 4 of these in short order, only to regret it later."
"12 ounce bottle that reads a 'best before date' of 02-20-05. Tough poo. I can't wait that long. The beer has idiot proof warnings about pouring it into pilsner glasses, so into the tulip it goes. Nice deep brown color with red hints. A vibrant head rises and then falls. Small lace remains throughout. Large sediment chunks in the very bottom, even with a slow pour. A rich malt smell rises and then wet leaves and carmel notes dominate. The standard fruity-alcohol flavors are there also, with cherries and fresh plums. Taste is very smooth with an interesting hop bite in the aftertaste. Again, uber-chewy malt gives this a heavy sweetness, but there is just enough balance to pull it through. Very much like Celebrator, with some New World kick to it. It's not quite authentic, but it is tasty. Probably Uni's best offering, IMO."
"This beer poured a dark, rich brown with a thin tan head that did not subside throughout the tasting. The aroma can best best characterized as very malty, with a nice fruit scent and a hint of chocolate. The taste is extremely smooth and filled with dark roasted malts, sweet fruits, and a slight hint of chocolate. The high alcohol content is very well masked by the overall rich taste of this beer. The mouthfeel is extremely pleasant due to the slight carbonation and the drinkability is dangerously high. This could very well, without a doubt, become one of my all-time favorite beers!"
"Drinkability - very tasty, worth a repeat performance, even at 9% abv."
"Poured a dark rich brown with an enormous white head, I wasn't watching my pour and ended up dumping the sediment straight in, oh well. Smell is very full of fruit. Plums, raisins dominate my perception. Taste is pleasant, but i was kind of expecting something on the level of St Bernardus abt 12. This is very solid but just didn't seem to have the same depth. It's fairly complex, just not something i could get lost in. Mouthfeel is good. Drinkability seems to be decent as well. I love the Unibroue line, this is definetly a beer a will purchase again. Just not my fave."
"An enjoyable beer."
"Another solid offering from Unibroue. Not as complex as some of the higher end Belgian offerings, but a nice take on the Belgian Strong Dark Ale style. If you like Imperial Stouts, you'll probably enjoy the influence of that style on this beer. My only real complaint with this beer is the mouthfeel, which hurts the overall experience. Still, very tasty."
"Beer is good. Happy beering."
"It's a very good beer, and stronger than Maudite, but it may not be as well balanced. Still, the layering in the taste makes one come back for subsequent sips out of curiosity."
"The flavor is a mixture of hops and dark fruits - they combine in the mouth together for a very pleasant, big flavor that lasts well beyond the actual sip."
"Serve this on nitro mix and rename it ""Trouble."" With a capital T."
"This is very drinkable. It's just as well that there is a dark bitter aspect, otherwise someone might be tempted to drink a lot of it at once. At 9%abv, this would be a bad thing come morning. I think I have now tried every Unibroue offering that I can get around here. Hopefully a journey to an area with more beer options - like, say, Seattle or Portland - will change that."
"Lots of carbonation, gives the mouthfeel an airy quality that's pleasant, but leaves some puckering stickiness on my palate."
"Poured into a Rapscallion snifter, hearty inch tall tannish colored head formed on top of an extremely cloudy reddish-mahogany hued brew. Good lacing, after swirling it justs hangs on the sides of the glass. Sweet, malty aroma, with a tinge of alcohol. Nice, hearty, bready flavor, with hardly any taste of the alcohol, just the slow, warming trend down the esophagus. Nice. Just what I expect from a dark Belgian-style ale."
"I could drink the whole 750ml bottle... probably the best tasting beer I've had."
"Trois Pistoles was served from a 750 ml. corked and caged bottle. It poured dark brown but in a Duvel tulip it was nearly black, and glowed a hazy reddish-orange-brown with backlighting. It was topped with a beautiful creamy off-white head that left very nice lacing. The fantastic nose was beaming with fruity esters, dominantly cherries, dipped in fine chocolate. Other esters were noticable just outside of the spotlight, such as cantolope and coconut. A tad of alcohol was present from time to time. The taste closely reflected the nose, but was much more complex. Again, the dominant sensation was one of sweet, dark cherries and chocolate, but this time, a whole world of other fruits/flavors danced over the palate. I imagined notes of cola, melon, pear, apple, banana, and bready yeast. All of this was presented with an active bite from the start, which contributed significantly in launching the flavor score to ""exceptional"". This wonderful world of flavor was followed by a sensation of warming in the throat and lingering flavors of sasparilla, cola, chocolate, and cherry. The body was fluffy, very smooth, and full. In conclusion, Trois Pistoles is a superb creation: Big complex flavor and strong, yet meticulously balanced and deft enough to make for easy drinking. This is likely my favorite Unibroue!"
"I'm a big fan of Belgian Strong Dark Ales and Trois Pistoles is an excellent example. Unibroue maintains its reputation for quality with this ale."
"This pours a very dark marroon color with a fizzy tan head that disaptes quickly. No lace left behind. Smell is of dark ripe fruit with plum and raisin coming to mind. Very sweet smelling. The taste is extremely sweet with dark roasted malts and a very slight hint of chocolate. The fruits really bring out this beer with plums, raisins and figs. The alcohol is well hidden under the rich taste of this beer. The aftertaste is just as the bottle says ""old port wine"". A quality product from Canada."
"Overall a high quality brew...but I'll take ""Terrible"" any day over this..."
"Mouthfeel: Full bodied and consisten with enough carbonation to make the exprience very pleasureable."
"Poured kinda cloudy and the head disappeared quickly with no lacing. But the beer was great in all other categories. Amazing flavor, smell etc. You can kinda taste the alcohol, but its not overpowering. Very good beer overall. Definitely in my top 10-15."
"This poured a nice brown color with a good-sized white head. It smells of malt and delicious spicy fruits. The taste is very much like the smell. The fruit is definitely more noticeble at the end. There isn't much sweetness here either. It's just right! This feels great in the mouth and has just enough foamy thickness to enhance the flavors. This is a drinkable brew and I'd like to have another. Alas, there is only one."
"Alcohol is hidden enough to make this beer drinkable, perhaps dangerously so. This one is destined to become a staple in the beer fridge."
"The beer was black, without much head. It smelled good, a berry type of smell. The taste was pretty good, you can certainly taste the fruit, as well as a somewhat chocolate taste. However, I didn't like the mouthfeel of the beer, since it had very little carbonation, and by the time I finished the 750 ml bottle, I had had enough of the beer."
"Trois the crown jewel of Unibroue's all around marvelous line of craft beers. Balanced, beautiful, and tasty. A must try experience for all beer fans."
"Not an impressive looking beer at all in the glass. Pours a coppery brown with a minimalist(I'm being kind)head. Perhaps I had a leaky bottle but the carbonation is just not showing itself. Smells weakly candy like with some sugars and nutmeg coming through. The taste is rather flat off the top with a real nice ramp up to the spices and brownie like texture. Carbonation is a little more present on the palate. Extremely easy on the tounge with a real smoth mouthfeel. Slightly sweet and very dry. Definitely a sipping beer."
"Pours out with a huge, bone-white head of small, dense bubbles that quickly fizzes out like a soft drink. Bah! (Disclaimer: I have had samples that look much better, easily worth a rating of ""4."") Threre's a bit of oozy cling to the liquid itself. Color of beer is near-opaque ebony; just a little bit of light comes through at the sides. Aroma is sweet from across the room; up in the nose it suggests fresh, sugary plums and black cherries; baking spices (mostly nutmeg?); and a strong, persistent yeast backbone that is somehow not bready. It's like they took my mom's black forest cherry cake and turned it into a beer. Despite the imposing appearance, nosefeel is delicate, cool, and expansive. Sweet taste (again, fresh! plums and black/sour cherries) would border on cola but a zap of spice (cinnamon especially, but also clove/nutmeg) levels it out, getting quite spicy in midpalate. The label suggests ""port wine," okay, I can see that; there's a continually developing tannic/dusty grapeyness to it. A combination of fresh fruit ""plumpness"" and dry fruit sweetness... Bold carbonation in a near-fudgy mouthfeel dries out to a very full, dry, powdered-chalky finish that takes its time moseying away. No alcohol detectable at any point, even at 9 abv. Superb as a digestif and bordering on decadent. Mm."
"Pours a dark brown with a moderate head. Muted aromas of nuts, plums, roasted meats. The flavors are similarly soft, of mild meats, slow roasted vegetables, and overipe fruits. The mouthfeel is well balanced and the beer goes down smoothly with little of the alcohol taste present in this offering (9%). A decent beer, but not as up front as some other of this style, and less so than this brewers other offerings."
"I will go out of my way to get this one again."
"As expected, another victory for Unibroue. Straight out of the bottle, Trois Pistoles is mean. Like the image on the label, this beer is dark and broody with more than a few surprises up its sleeve (like the unnoticably high 9.0% abv). From its black body arises the aroma of fruit, like unripened pears. On the tongue, it feels at once crisp and dry as well as mellow. No hops are needed for this to stand tall like the Three Towers of its name. Very drinkable, but probably not recommended for long sessions, unless you've got the liver for it."
"An exceptionally easy to drink brew, very mild. If you like strongly flavored beers this will not satisfy you. If you like subtle flavors then this beer is for you."
"Again, it's not complicated, it's just great! There's no need to hunt and peck through the flavors; each piece fits well and compliments the others. Each character is enjoyable and alluring. In spite of the very present high ABV, I'll brave the alcohol for future indulgences. There's just enough of each thing, and never too much of any one thing, so three cheers for the Three Coins!"
"pour. Dissapates at a moderate pace but never fully disappears. Smells a lot different than other beers I've had. If you let it warm up in the mouth you can faintly taste the alcohol. Its a little fruity, very malty, and has a very good wine-like aftertaste. With a 9% ABV, it is deceivingly drinkable. A very fine brew indeed."
"This one is a murky amber mahagony color and is topped off with a thin off-white head of foamy goodness. Sweet sugary fruits in the aroma -almost like a pre-made sweet and sour mix. Deep and complex sweetness in the taste. There's a touch a smoky caramel malt, sweet spices, fruits and licorice. Very nice. Alcohol is well hidden behind all of the strong flavors. It's a medium bodied beer that is very flavorful and very much enjoyable. Not a session beer, but an enjoyable treat."
"This brew is eye candy, with its chocolate brown color and thick, bubbly head. It just looks fantastic in a glass. The complex aromas of sweet, ripe fruits (cherries/plums) billow out of the glass. It has a full, sweet body holding flavors of caramel, chocolate, and cherries/raisins, finishing alcohol dry. The finish looses it a bit for me with the strong alcoholic bite but otherwise a great evening drink."
"Very drinkable with food. You can easily put away a big bottle of this (or two) despite the ABV."
"Well, I think I am finally able to constructively evaluate stronger brews. In the past the alcohol was usually evident and that influenced my evaluation. Now I am able to pick up more of the subtleties and this offering has some great subtleties. Appearance was like dark cherries witha beautifully carbonated head that remained, though somewhat diminished down the glass. Smell..mmmm..cherry-like IMHO, alcohol undertones, with some yeasty elements... a great blend. Taste was equally complex...fruity, alcohol, yeast, wine-like elements. Mouthfeel...medium with a beautiful astringency at the finish. For the abv (9.0) very drinkable."
"Served from a 750ml bottle. Pours a dark mahogany with a decent head that disspates fairly quickly. Smell is of fruit, a little sweetness and some alcohol. There was a lot of carbonation to this bottle. I've read other people saying theirs was undercarbonated. Not this one. If anything, it got much better as the carbonation mellowed out. Flavor is of ripe fruit, spicy, a little bit of chocolate and rich malt. Just a little hops and an amazingly dry finish. There was also a little alcohol present in the taste. All in all this is a very good beer, but I think it still has a little ways to go before I'd put it up there with strong ales such as St. Bernardus Abt 12. There's nothing that I dislike about this beer... however, it didn't knock my socks off either."
"Wow, this stuff is fantastic. Pours a deep brown/mahogany with a beautiful light tan head. Aroma is grassy, alcohol and berry-like. Very dry, but smooth mouthfeel. Taste is spicy, berry (or perhaps cherry). A little bit of chocolate perhaps. Some caramel, and minor hops. Very earthy. This may be one of the best Belgian dark ales I've had in a while. Fairly cheap too."
"What the gods would drink. Dark brown brew with slight hint of red nice tan head that subside to a ever clinging ring of foam. Smells of dark wonderful fruity paradise, plums, raisens, bananas list goes on. Tastes the same fruity flavored malt slight yeast taste with a small touch of hops, and a nice dry finish.Sweet wonderful brew this must be what Homer is thinking of when he says"" ummm beer", definatley better then any Duff I have ever had. Extremely drinkable must always have some on hand, if you have not tried it please do yourself a favor and buy some."
"Poured a very deep reddish brown and clear with a tan head that dissapears quickly. Wonderful fruity malty aroma that reminds me of a good Belgian ale. Mouthfeel is lively and medium bodied. Has an excellent balanced flavor of malts that gives a fruity roasted malt flavor that could equal many of its Belgian cousins. Finishes with a sugary sweetness that is abundantly pleasant. Probably the best widely available ale of this style."
"Note - This is my third bad bottle from Uniboue (2 maudites)"
"Deep brownish-red hue, dense and murky with minimal light penetration, the beige head reached a good two fingers in height. The retention was excellent; the pack of bubbles lasted the entire quaff. Unorganized sheets of lace doted the side of my glass. The aromatics on the nose were impressive and deceiving. The bouquet was surprisingly light and airy with pleasant whiffs of pepper, traces of marshmallows, bready-yeastiness and yeasty fruitiness too. Plus there is an excellent hint of chocolate malts. While the potency is modest it is inviting and complex. The palate is light, with subtle fruitiness upfront, apples mainly, a kiss of marshmallow that is engulfed by the pepperiness and then lightly roasted, chocolate malts of the middle and finish. In the end the maltiness is pleasantly secondary, as hints of dates, raisins, and horse blanket shine more. The aftertaste is unearthly with apples, pepper, fruitiness, and maltiness, somewhat dry. A stunningly well crafted beverage, devilish really, the 9% abv is absent on the palate. I did, however, notice the beer on the brain. Warming. The body is medium; excellent levels of carbonation it is just firm enough. Wow, the ease of consuming this ale is scary, considering it is an extremely complex brew. If, for some odd reason youve failed to try this beer, you must. Trois Pistoles is simply lovely. Unibroue has sold me on their greatness. I scored this 750 ml in Kansas City. I want more."
"The taste is out of this world! Admittedly, I typically don't fall head over feet for Belgian ales, but this strong dark ale is the exception. I place it above Maudite, Chambly, and La Fin Du Monde easily. If it weren't a bit pricey I'd keep it around at all times."
"Outstanding flavor! Raisins, yeast, plums, prunes, buttered bread and alcohol. Very smooth going down with great mouthfeel."
"This beer grew on me a little. I'd drink another sometime, but I'm not in a hurry. It was drinkable, and enjoyable as a flavor excursion, but not remarkable."
"A lovely brew that satisfies the need for complexity. A great looking copper/dark amber body is covered with a rich, thick head of cream that laces throughout the glass. An aroma of fruit greets the drinker with a smell of grapes and cherries, perhaps even a bit of raisin and plum. The spicy, fruity flavors are just as complex with a strong sense of vinous quality. A bit of spice and cloves carries through as well. The medium body is lasting and gives a bit of strong aftertaste, almost syrupy in its finish. The drinkability is good considering the high ABV."
"Overall, I don't think I'll be able to finish the bottle. Just not my cup of beer."
"Dark brown with a red gleam. The head is dense, generous and it accompanies you through your journey. Malty and fruity aroma of grape. The taste is complex: an adequate balance of chocolate, roasted caramel, cherries, grapes, spices, yeast (less than Unibroue's standard). A light alcohol (not quite well-hidden, but about what I expect from good belgians of this ABV) Bitterness joins you until the end. It's a rich and complex beverage, but while it's probably not overrated, I prefer many other belgian strong ales to this one.."
"Medium feel, and very drinkable at least to the point you're still able to lift your glass."
"Belgian Dark Ales aren't my favourite, although I think I can appreciate them - and this is a great one. Well balanced, great nose, doesn't look bad in the slightest... easy recommendation for anyone."
"One of My favorite beers. Every sip is a different delicious taste sent to the brian. Top pick from Canada's finest brewery will hold its own against Belgian ales. Nice at the end of a meal or for lunch instead of a heavy latte. Five and a half years till finally found on tap, at Volo's, and really not as good on tap, not as much body and taste, though aroma was there."
"The label art on this one is just evil, it looks very dark and demented. Alas, I was disappointed when I poured it and it came out, red! What the dark ale on lees is going on around here? In reality it is more of a dark reddish-brown than red, and one can see through it as well. It pours quite a creamy-whitish head and the aromas that dance off of this one are quite crazy. This definitely well hopped but with a spice kick of some variety. Perhaps bitter orange peel, coriander, pepper, or even ginger? I couldn't quite place it. This is truly a very unique beer that falls within the belgian variety. I very impressed with what these French Canadians can do with & to beer."
"Basically, I was blown away by this beer. Its so simple with all these fruit tones and mellow dark malts. I swear the brewers at Unibroue are really Belgians. This is an amazing beer, and for the price a steal."
"Surprisingly light body , dry but a bit fizzy mouthfeel - this makes the beer seem lighter than it really is..."
"This is a wonderful balance of many complex flavours and aromas. Very finely crafted by the Quebec Unibroue folks. This could become one of my all time favourites. Geeez..I'm starting to spell stuff Canadian(flavour, favourite). This stuff is hard to find in Kentucky, so I guess I will cellar my remaining two bottles, eh!"
"Drinkability: A great sipper... could easily do 2 or 3 of these."
"$5.99 for the mag."
"Pours a full tan head, a deep brown color, hazy, opaque. CO2 rolling up along the edges of the lacing. The aroma is malty, spicy, and earthy with a background presence of alcohol and some tartness. The taste is sweet, roasted, and spicy, with a tart middle and a dry finish that lingers with liquorish and sassafras. A medium bodied mouth-feel with sufficient effervescence. A well-rounded brew. Not overpowering for such an intense style. Taste was best around 53 degrees ? started loosing its balance as it warmed more. Might have needed some more aging."
"A difficult beer for me as I will always remember it as the beer I drank as the Cubs lost to the Marlins in the NLCS 2003. And as I forgot to respect it, it got the very best of me the next morning!!! Be Warned!!! The beer poured a very orange/red almost wine like color. The stick was rock solid. Aromatics were fruit driven and complex-melon,sour cherries, botrytis-where's the blue cheese? Medium in body with soft bitter chocolate and light buttery fruitiness. A faint peach and tangy raisin note adds to the finish of this very, very complex and intriguing brew. This is a more wine like offering where the malt plays a second to the fruit. I'm thinking pear and blue cheese-seared foie gras?...incidently, my notes say ""...end of the 9th..Cubs down 9-6...I need four pistoles!! all I can do to keep from throwing this glass to the floor....we got Wrigley?!"" God the hangover sucked the next day."
"Overall, this was one great beer. Drinkability suffers a bit due to the alcohol it packs. Nevertheless, it's a superbly crafted beer that's just right for slowly drinking over the course of a quiet evening."
"Taste is of sweet, candy malts, tart grapes, Unibroue yeast, and oak. Finish is wheat bitter with lingering, warming alcohol and grapes. Mouthfeel is big and champagnelike in carbonation--a little syrupy at the end."
"Drinkability wins high marks for being flavorful and complex without feeling heavy or thick or ""big"". This will most definitely be granted a residence in my beer cellar."
"I liked the strong carbonation, which gave a clean feel to the mouth during and after drinking. It packs a wallop of alcohol, whch I think adds quite a bit to the flavor. Overall, an excellent beer."
"Dark brown brew with a creamy dark white head. Real fizzy, I still had bubble coming on top five-ten minutes after the brew was pourred. The alcohol was not too prevalent and the taste was sweet and fruity. Usual malt taste from Unibroue. Very nice brew overall."
"Dark purple color. Small head. Aroma is slightly vinous, fruity and dusky. Malty and fruity. Very complex flavors; raisins, grapes, figs with a musty undertone. This is a very nice beer. Very smooth, it hides the 9% alcohol very well. There is a hint of alcohol tartness on the tongue. Tasty beer. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is slightly bitter."
"Poured a black color that refuses to let light through the glass with coffee colored head and medium carbonation. Delicious aromas of fruits and spices. Starts very thick and builds to a wondrous full body punctuated with fruit and nut and chocolate tastes then finishes with warmth and a lingering port wine taste"
"So smooth, velvety texture. High carbonation, but not altogether unwelcome. The biting subsides and the warming begins soon after it's gone down. Sweet chewy malts make their way to the front, and a nice warm, dry alcohol finish. A superbly crafted, truly BIG beer! Cheers Unibroue!"
"very dark brown with a light tan head. the smell is fruity like marachino(sp?) cherries and vanilla, a little citrus behind it as well, and a bit of a mild wine smell too some roasted malts in there too maybe. the taste is fruity (cherry, raisin), but mild, slightly peppery. starts sweet and then finishes with a little bitterness to clean things up. at times just a little boozy. i think that the carbonation should be a bit lower and the mouthfeel a bit thicker, but no real problem here. overall one of the best beers i've had the priviledge to drink. try it if you haven't i'm gonna move onto some other unibroue if they're anything like this one"
"Nice dark thick brown color with a nice thin amount of head. The smell is of yeast with a slight fruitiness along with a raison aroma. The taste is smooth and subtle yet flavorful with hints of fruits and a light aftertaste that tends to linger. Very nice mellow tasting beer that isn't overpowering because of the good balance. Slightly bitter to end with. Though I like the mellowness of the beer I do wish there was a little bit more fullness to the taste but overall a really good beer."
"Drinkability: A lot of factors at play that could slow you down, but everything here is in perfect balance. Bravo!"
"Perhaps the best beer in my stop in the US, and, oh lord, canadian. Wow."
"Pours nice dark brown with light tan head. Dissappates to a nice light lace. Vanilla and fruit in the nose. Very bubbly to the tongue. Tastes a little like rootbeer. Some vanilla and fruit. Nice velvetty mouthfeel. Very similar to Belgian beer. Another fine Unibroue offering. This is a very enjoyable beer to drink."
"Pours a dark, caramely brown, with a think, light tan, foamy head. Aroma is a bit sweet. Floral and fruity (cherries?) scents issue forth. Taste is mellow and nicely sweet, with fruit flavors (plumes, cherries, others) coming through. Almost reminds me of wine in flavor. The finish is dry with a very pleasant, lingering in the mouth. A hint of alcohol is present in the taste as well, but does not take away from the overall wonderful and complex flavors. Very smooth and highly drinkable despite the deceptively high alcohol content."
"Update  I reviewed this initially with a 2003 and thought it would be interesting to review a 2004 vintage. This beer just blows me away. I cant believe that its not brewed in Belgium. I just love so many things about it, but that dark yeast flavor just puts me in heaven. I juggled some ratings around to include upping the Drinkability to a perfect 5.0."
"Bonjour mon amis Unibroue. Is that flying horse going to kick my ass? This imposing brew is very dark crimson little if any light can break through. Fizzy brown head eventually fades to coat the top for eternity. Smells fantastic, a wine like aroma with dark ripe fruits--grapes, plums, and a pleasant yeast aroma as well. I can taste the ripe fruits, and the sweetness is balanced by the mouth numbing Unibroue yeast and hints of alcohol. These mellow dark flavors are sublime."
"Pours a nearly opaque, dark mahogany with a thick head of fine bubbles. Little lacing as the head recedes. Aromas are sweet, figs, plums, perfume-like. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy and definitely of fuller body. Flavors are all sweet and reflect the nose with fragrant plums and a hint of licorice. Incredibly smooth and balanced despite the 9% ABV. Overall this is a fine example of a belgian style strong dark ale, with only a slightly reduced drinkability because of the high alcohol."
"Never seen a beer look like this one. Pours out a solid brown color brew with a thick frothy head that diminishes half way through to a thin lacing. Yeasty, grainy and a bit of malts made up the aroma here actually and a hint of alcohol. Taste was exceptional yeasty and chocolatly also a bit of alcohol and some raisons or some type of fruit. Very drinkable and very good..."
"Drinkability: Most decidedly not a session beer. Cries out for food like cheeses and properly crusty bread. Still, it goes down quite smoothly."
"This beer has a very dark ruby red color - a fine off white lace is clinging to the side of the glass but not much else in the way of head. It has a very fruity, almost wine-like smell to it. The taste is wine-like, as well - full of fruit, with a slight astringency and a prominent ethanol burn and aftertaste. A full mouthfeel. Not nearly as drinkable as Fin du Monde, however."
"Much better than La Fin. Huge medium-coarse head that stuck around for some time. Way too much carbonation to start, but after some time it was alright. Dark ripe fruit from the previous sip is scoured away by the bubbles and replaced with another dose to contemplate. Some bittersweet chocolate and spices come and go throughout the glass. This one does the Unibroue name justice."
"Dark ruby-bronze with a huge, frothy Belgian-style beige head. Terrific fragrance that is nearly indescribable, but suggests roses, berries, and a woodshop. Pleasing complex, organic flavor. Moderately sweet flavor of nectar. Soft palate. I feel like a happy hummingbird feeding from my favorite flower. I totally dig this beer."
"I had this right after the Maudite, and I think I slightly prefer the Maudite's sweetness to the fruit flavors of the Trois Pistoles. This, however, is really nitpicking because Unibroue's beers are all simply awesome, and the Trois Pistoles is no exception."
"ng"
"This is a big beer, 9% alcohol. I think the beer would be better if they made it a little sweeter. As it is not the high alcohol gives you a very warm drinking feeling. The brewer used to brew at Chimay and makes a good beer. For the style this isn't my favorite but it is a good beer and well worth the money. Wish they had a draft version."
"Pours a nice medium brown with a medium sticky head,aroma is sweet and spicey with some alcohol notes.The taste is sweet and and malty with some real nice spicey notes,very clovey and sweet very appetizing.The alchol really comes thru as it warms,a real true belgian stule ale,very appetizing."
"Notes: Delicious. Prefer this to La Fin and Maudite."
"Pours a brown with a nice head. Nice and spicey with a touch of fruity (cherry perhaps.) Malts are sweet and strong, but the flavor balance is nice. Very complex, even for Unibroue. The 9 percent is very hidden. Perhaps too hidden. Quite the drinkable!"
"Drinkablility: A nice beer but not somethig i would have everyday. To me this is a sweeter, less spicey version of Maudite."
"Poured from a brown 750 ml bottle, it is a heavenly cherry oak tone, frothy tan head that recedes to a thick ring and some lacing. Nose contains cherries, caramel, spices, mild herbal tones. Flavour is immediately that of sweet malt, sour cherry, some citrus, a bit grassy, a bit woody, then on to a spicy finish, some floral hops, and a boozy sherry-like aftertaste (to be expected with the 9% abv). The flavour then comes back again with a caramel/toffee taste that lingers in the mouth long after it's been swallowed. This ale is utterly remarkable, only the second time I have ever tried it. I am kicking myself now, as I'll soon be setting some bottles aside to mature. If I were a genie, this is the bottle I'd choose to live in."
"This is a huge pleasure of a beer. It isn't the first time I've had this one and definitely not the last. It pours with a pleasant head which dissipates to a golden ring which never really leaves. The color is cinnamon. It forecasts that this is a beer for food. With cinnamon I'd expect a dessert but this beer is firstly a steak beer (trust me here.... I've been drinking it for years) and then with aged goat cheese....it's a pairing to revisit. It tastes wonderful by itself and with food it matures into the straight man in an improv sketch. It's an all night beer. The ABV makes it a short one but worthy."
"To quote my fiancee, ""This is the best beer I've even had."" I don't know if its the best but definately in the top 10."
"750ml bottle. Poured a hazy amber brown with a good head that slowly receded to a fine ring, leaving sone thin lace behind. Aroma is sweet, fruity, and slightly malty. Very appealing! Taste is sweet, with a cream sherry like flavor and finish. Good carbonation, with a smooth mouthfeel, and a slightly bitter aftertaste. This is pretty good, but needs some aging to mature."
"Pours an amber brownish color that looks thick and has a good sized head. Looks very good. And the taste is equally as good. This beer has a very sharp taste to it (probably from the high amount of carbonation). The sweet malts (namely caramel) are noticeable but not dominate, they just hold the other flavors together. Other flavors include some spicyness from the hops, a dark fruit taste mixed with a dark wine taste. Alcohol is only apparent in the spicy, dry finish. Another great one from Unibroue."
"The alcool is a little too evident."
"Appears a deep amber brown hue almost opaque with a tawny cream colored head with little or no lace forming in my snifter. Aroma really full hop aroma here pine cone scented this hopped up Belgium style barley wine harmonizes with spices and peppery ripened fruit tones and just a touch of an alcholic finish. Taste is difficult to describe teh complexity of this beer is so vast, I will say I love it. A spritzy ginger like sweet tone blended with a nice amount of ripened fruit awesome beer in my opinion. Mouthfeel has a nice carbonation buttery mouthfeel with a medium to full body very well built cerveza. Drinkability is addicting, in the sense that I could sit and daydream about having another one of these beers although feasibly probably a one at time 9% abv big boy."
"Certainly, this is a well-crafted brew, but it just doesn't do as much for me as Don De Dieu, Maudite, or La Fin Du Monde. The light metallic note, overly spicy spritzy mouthfeel and phenolic finish take some getting used to compared to other Unibroues, but it is still a very good beer compared to most."
"I pored this 750ml bottle for a myself and a friend. After the initial pour, the thick head continued to swell, overflowing all over the coffee table. Cleaning up the mess, I noticed the malty, dark, almost sticky sweet murky odor. The lacing remained crusted on the glass until I scrubbed it the next day. The table had a sticky feel the next morning. It tasted malty-sweet, slightly like cherries, or even cherry flavored cough syrup. It also reminded me of sourdough bread, thick and bready, with that sour, mulch-like taste. The high alcohol content knocked me on my ass, and there were no seconds! Not for the meek."
"Pours a out a lightly cloudy brown with a nice head that holds the lacing very well. Smell is on the sweetish side, with malt and a little chocolate overtone. Taste is complex, with cloves and raisins feeling the mouth with the alcohol touching the edges of the tongue. Well balanced and tasty; a brew I'll go back to again easily."
"This Dark Ale is a deep brown color with ruby highlights and tan head. The complex aroma includes roasted barley, spicy hops, fruit, cloves and fumes of alcohol. The deep rich malt houses flavors of caramel, toffee and a hint of banana. Highly hopped with spicy and lemony citrusy bitterness along with ripe mixed fruit. A powerful, well made brew!"
"I had this one in a 12oz. bottle poured into a tulip-style glass. It pours a very dark brown with 2 fingers of head that die off slowly. There is almost no trace of lacing left on the glass. The smell is a sweet aroma of banana and toffee. A strong smell, but not overpowering. The taste has a bit of fruit and caramel to it, with just a hint of toffee. The balance is a little on the malty side, and there is an alcohol taste to the finish. The mouthfeel is okay, but a little bubbly. The drinkability is just fair at 9% abv."
"Overall, a good beer, but I prefer Don de Dieu or Maudite. I think those 2 both have a better flavor."
"This brew poured a large invigorating tan head with fine-small bubbles that quickly dissolved. The lacing was sparse on the sides of my glass. The body was a reddish brown. The aroma was fruity and sweet. This brew had a smooth taste and a good mouthfeel. I REALLY, REALLY enjoyed drinking this brew!! Do we have more of this one thedm??"
"This brew poured an envigorated large head of fine to medium sized bubbles that left little lacing and lasted a good length of time. Its body was a very cloudy semi-opaque deep brown color. It has a very nice strong malt aroma and a very smotth initial flavor that finishes much more complex than it starts. its high alcohol content is well hidden in its flavor. The flavoe is very hard to describe. It is highly complex with a lightly fizzy, tongue tingling sensation of malts and spices. Extremely good brew. I will definately try this again in one of their larger bottles."
"This is one awesome brew, I could drink alot of these but the 9% hits ya if you drink it fast, but its so good why not, you gotta go sleep sometime. Excellent stuff."
"Originally sampled on 17 June 2002. Cloudy, dark brown color w/ a nice head, this beer is elegant. There are so many subtle fruity & spicey flavors that it was like tasting a fine wine. Don't miss this one. Take your time to savor it. great job unibroue"
"First off, wow. A beautiful brownish-ruby color with a nice tan head that dissipates somewhat, but a nice thin line remains. The taste was somewhat fruity to begin with (banana-nut bread), then finished spicy and crisp. Perhaps the taste was more like a spicy port wine. There was definitely something about the flavor that I can't even imagine to appropriately describe, and I loved it. The drinkability of this dark ale was surprisingly high. I'm certainly a huge fan and I'll be buying this one many, many more times."
"aroma of alcohol and a malt or port wine. flavors of malt with rasins or fermented grapes (yeah, ok) there is a quite spicy nip that says nice things to the tip of the tongue. it finishes nicely: warm spice and carmel balance on ripe fruit. some hints of cinnamon, coco. mouthfeel is thick and crispy too, alot of bubbles help convey everything. burps high into the nose with spicy Co2. this is a very good beer as far as i am concerned. thanks for reading my review."
"Drinkability: Scores well in it's drinkability. This is a delicious beer and it's hefty strength is the only thing that prevents me from drinking bottle after bottle of it. More please..."
"Easy mouthfeel: none too creamy, oily, or watery. This beer doesnt come off as a heavy dark brew, as it was not heavy in scent, body, or taste. Thus it is very easy to drink, as the short finish helps and hurts it. Overall, I expected a little bit of punch or complexity of flavors."
"This beer poured a cloudy mahogany that when held to the light the edges glowed with an orange hue, not overly cloudy though, I could see the carbonation bubbles escaping from the bottom of the glass. The head that was produced wad thick, rich, dense and lasting, and was tan in color. As far as lace, it started from the top of the glass and lasted until the last sip. The aromas that came from my glass (sniffing outside in the fresh air) were as follows  dark malts, caramel, dark fruits (black cherries), alcohol (slight), baked apples, spices (black and red peppercorns), grass and a hint of yeast. Very complex. The tastes that I experienced were of dark malts, cherry wood oak barrel that might have been used to age, alcohol (slight), citrus, dark fruits (dark cherries), melted brown sugar, baked apples, ground black pepper, and a deep port wine to finish. This beer was far more complex then I would have believed. It was thick, creamy and chewy all at once. Amazing how Unibroue hides all that alcohol behind all those complex flavors. This is a great beer that can be sipped for some time by itself or drank with almost any full flavored meal that is served with. Amazing!"
"The body was rich and full, and very luxurious. Overall an excellent beer! I'm starting to understand Unibroue's fame."
"ABV limits the drinkability."
"Vive le Trois Pistoles! Merci, Unibroue! C'est une bonne biere!"
"Amazing color: a deep, dark purple. It has a thick, creamy head that's in no hurry to go anywhere. Smells fruity. There is not a tremendous amount of aroma there, but what you do get is pleasant. Tastes smoky. Feels foamy, but ends refreshing and not very sweet. Leaves hardly any aftertaste. Very mellow. Amazing drinkable."
"This beer pours a really dark amber color with a medium dingy head that fades quickly. The aroma is very sweet and promising of a good taste. Upon first taste, this reminds me of a very sweet wheat beer. It has hints of fruit in the taste and the carbonation is very apparent when drinking, but overall it reminds me of a really smooth wheat beer. It is not excessively smooth to drink and it is pretty flavorfull. I could not see myself drinking more than one of these at a sitting because of the fullness of the flavor and the fact that I am not too fond of it. Nothing special about it in my opinion."
"Drinkability  This went down very well. It was gone before I knew it."
"Pours with a thick white head, but quickly dissipates into nothing. Cloudy dark copper in color. I was not impressed with the appearence. I'm glad I didn't judge a book by it's cover though. Wonderful spicy aroma. The label even has a little warning not to use a pisner glass. You'll want to use something that shows off this aroma. Very fruity and spicy with littly to no hoppiness. I'm thinking belgian dubbel, but the high alcohol content suggests something different. The alcohol content is very well hidden in the intense fruitiness of the malt."
"Pours a brown with amber hints and a long lived tan head that is lively and sinks down the sides faster than the middle.. The nose is spicy and malty with a tinge of alcohol. The flavor is rather good with sweet malt and spice as well with a distinct and noticeable alcohol finish as well. The hops are well blended but mild. Overall very decent - Drink at a cool but not cold temperature."
"The smell is sweet, with fruits and berries, slightly malty. The front shows sweet caramel and spice giving way to apples in the middle, with a notice of alcohol. The finish is crisp but dark. Again, I notice some alcohol at the cooler temps, but overall this is a great beer. It used to be my favorite U, maybe still."
"The flavor is just as smooth. It had a bit of yeasty spiciness to it, and a slight sweetness that followed a mild hop bitterness. Very fruity, delicious, and highly drinkable at 9%. Another great one from Unibroue."
"Mahogany in color with a tan head. The aroma is sweet almost like brown sugar. There is also a faint fig smith with a bit of fruitiness. The flavors that jump out are an herbal/medicinal flavor, sweet candi sugar, and alcohol. It is a medium-full bodied beer that finished semi-sweet, and alcoholic. A very tasty brew."
"My list of favorite beers is dominated by Unibroue. I recently did a head to head comparison between this and Chimay Blue. It was very close, and the differences are subtle. The Unibroue is perhaps a bit spicier, the Chimay slightly smoother. Trois pistoles pours the usual magnificent head, with good retention. Very dark, looks almost identical to the Chimay. Has a quenching, yet substantial taste. As is the case with the other Unibroue offerings, almost a wheat-beer like refreshing quality, but is complex and packs a quite a punch. No alcohol noted in the taste, but certainly in the effect. With all of the varieties, I could drink Unibroue almost every night (if not for the fear of overwhelming my liver, I probably would!). This can't compare to Rochefort or Westy, but for the price and availability, you can't really go wrong. Make sure to let this warm up. Cold, it tastes like a rum and coke!"
"Murky brown appearance. Decent sized light tan head fizzes away until all that remains is a thin film and nice looking collar. Aroma is sweet like candy and musty like the ocean breeze. A little grape as well. And some cherry syrup drizzled on top. The feel in the mouth is slightly airy and a bit carbonated. Not like a champange though. Body is roughly medium. Flavor profile is subtle yet complex. Sweet malts, biscuit and a bit of bitter hops are detected. There's a unique mustiness present that throws me into a big Deja Vu. Flavor's also a little medicinal and phenolic, a little yeasty and quite fruity. All in all, an agreeable Belgian style beverage."
"A very dark brew with hints of a red hue here and there. Very nice head on top, off-white. It doesn't stay as well as I'd like it to, though. Nevertheless, this beer is quite beautiful when presented in its signature glass. The aroma doesn't fall short of this either. Sharp and spicy with dark fruits such as plums and currants. Very reminiscent of a great dubbel. A strong caramel sweetness is present in the background, holding everything up. On the palate, it's again in the range of a dubbel. Initially it's very smooth and caramelly sweet, then in the middle the huge spice and fruit characters really kick in. The fruitiness is currant and plum again, with some grape in there as well. A sharp hop twang backs all of it up, pairing perfectly with the spice and currant. In the back, the fruitiness gets kind of rind-like, like plum skin. Finishes with a smack of spice and hops and a bit more sweetness. Malty smoothness throughout. Just a touch of pepper here and there. Some leafy hop character in the aftertaste, along with some other things that are hard to pull out of the flavor when it's actually in your mouth, making for a very pleasant aftertaste. A wonderful dubbel overall. That's what I'd call it, it fits that description more than dark strong ale, in my opinion. Very much a warming brew. I think some aging would smooth this out in a good way. I wish I had a cellar or a nice cool closet that stayed that way year-round. Another strong offering from Unibroue, always one of the best when it comes to Belgian-style ales."
" Smooth like a sharkskin, just don't rub it the wrong way."
"Wow! I liked the la Fin Du Monde but this is much better! A dark brown color out of the bottle. Nice tight white head that hangs around forever and doesnt leave much of a lace. (Could be my glass) A fruity aroma hits your nose. I think it has a high carbonation content. Nice. A fruit flavor comes across your tongue. Not too sweet, hints of caramel and a slight finish of hops."
"Talk about a a good brew Ay! This is my first venture into Canadian brews, other than the regular macro stuff. I must say, that this is quite impressive. Just like the bottle suggests, it has a similar taste to a port wine. There is definately a taste of grapes in it too. Has a very dry finish, but it still coats the mouth well and leaves a little bit of an alcohol taste about it. I will definately get this one again."
"Dark, cloudy brown in color with a very nice head that lasts. I have been waiting to try this beer for a long time. The smell is fruity and sweet with a hint of malt. The taste is very complex. Very effervesent with flavors that change over and over. The beginning is more of the fruit and citrus. The middle and ending are more sweet, dry and warming. An amazing beer that I can't wait to have again. I have a bottle ageing nicely!"
"Other comments: The bottle didn't make much of a pop when I uncorked it, so it must have lost some carbonation over the years. However, extended aging did not harm this one as much as it harmed the bottle of Maudite I cellared next to it. This one is still a drinkable, fairly interesting beer."
"Trois Pistoles is the probably the closest attempt at a Canadian Trappist Beer that you will ever experience."
"Overall a very nice Belgian style dark ale. Plenty of malt, and alcohol along with a wonderful yeast. It looks good, It smells good. It feels good. It taste wonderful. And it will make you forget all your worries and cares."
"A real treat of a beer, and a rare delight. Only the finest of human beings should put this to their lips, as a benedicton and reflection of the worthiness of their souls. So, all you slobs, go better yourselves before daring to crack the cage and cork. So go do community service, adopt a stray kitten, give a street urchin a quarter, let someone on the freeway before you, be kind to our fine feathered friends, turn a Bud man on to oatmeal stouts, just do something to realign your karma to make you worthy enough to pour this fine beer down your gullet."
"Acquired via trade, although it took me so long to get around to drinking it that it became available in Ohio in the meantime. D'oh! Anyway, this beer pours a deep ruby color with a medium beige head. Aroma of cherry, vanilla, figs, and raisin. Fruity flavor of plum and raspberry, with a lightly chocolate malt finish. Very easy on the tongue, unlike a lot of Belgian Ales. Absolutely smooth and easy to drink. Very good."
"If you like dark belgian beers I would definetly recommend this one. It's full of flavors that leave you wanting more."
"Absolutely delicious. Pours out to a plum color in the glass with a decent, brown sugar-looking head. The aroma is all over the place, with fruit, plums, yeast and although it sounds strange, a sweet tart candy smell. Taste is excellent, with a variety of spices lingering in the mouth. Mouthfeel is near perfect and the finish, while warming, masks the high ABV. Yum."
"Notes: This is the second Belgian beer out of a 3 pack from Unibroue that I have tried. Maudite being the first, I enjoyed Trois Pistoles a lot more. It more smoothly tasted to me, and had a better aftertaste as well. These beers are my initiation into the world of Belgian Ales and I like this style of ale so far. I highly recommend this beer for anyone like me who is just getting into the style."
"Drinkability: Dangerously good."
"Open carefully, this one likes to overflow maybe because it is refermented in the bottle, very good carbonation and head but not much lace. Cloudy reddish brown, nose is raisiny so is taste. Smooth, full bodied and malty - very easy to drink but savor at 9% ABV. $1.50 for a 330ml bottle from Capitol Convenience Concord, NH."
"Note:"
"Pours brown like a deep varnish. Smells of raisins. Taste is hard to describe but in a good way. Sweet tasting, figs, raisins, dark fruit. This bottle sat in the beer cellar for about 9 months. Best before 9-4-04. 12 fl. oz bottle. Fig newtons flavor. Don't notice overpowering alcohol presence. Worthy of contemplation and reflection."
"Poured a murky reddish brown with a foamy tan head. Aroma has a strong fruity boquet to it consisting of raisins, caramel, malt and chocolate. Mouthfeel was smooth and mildly crisp from the carbonation. Alcohol isn't overpowering, but does lend a nice warming effect as it goes down. Ale does have a port wine like quality to it as the label states. Being my first Unibroue beer I didn't know quite what to expect, but this was truly a delicious treat."
"Chestnut brown in hue with a thick tan head that lasts for quite a few minutes. Toasty malts and pine on the nose. Nice clean roasted and caramel flavors. Pretty strong carbonation and medium body. There is a nice alcohol warmth that comes through the middle and a dry finish. Darn good brew!"
"The beer after disemboguing from the 750ml brown bottle takes up residence in my Unibroue Trois Pistoles glass a murky plum color with the head Bunyanesque and the texture spumous, the lace a sticky thick clinging sheet that completely obscures the glass. Aroma of malt, hints of ripe fruit I like to say plums, sweet and quite a clean and fresh nose. Malt dominates the start, sweet and the top middling in feel, finish is stingingly acidic, hops robust and plentiful, quite dry aftertaste also long lasting. The high ABV makes this a fine winter warmer and a good beer to sample on New Years Eve."
"After the first sip, I told my wife this is my favorite from Unibroue. She quickly reminded me that I said that after La Fin Du Monde, Maudite, etc. Pours a dark brown with a big foamy head that lasts, and laces well. Slight aroma of fruits, maybe bigger, but I have a slight cold. Wonderful dark fruit taste and smooth mouthfeel. Silky going down. Clean finish with hints of pepper and spices to go with the fruits. Just a great Belgian Dark. Big alcohol prevents me from having more than 3 or 4 or....."
"Deep brown reddish color with a thin tan head and an attempt at lacing that slides down the sides after each sip. I notice a bit of everything in the nose from vanilla, to fruit, and malt, and hops, raisins. The taste is much more simple yet great. It is sweet with a thin malt slap, followed by some alcohol kick - which is a good kick. Great finish, smooth and easy. This is a great beer, my favorite so far from Unibroue."
"Cheers"
"This beer poured a very dark reddish amber and formed a light tan bubbly head that left some circular lace. Some carbonation is present as well. An aroma of caramel and spices. A flavor of chocolate, a hint of caramel and spices. Some of the alcohol is present in the finish which was a touch astrigent. A very nice beer."
"I understand this brand is very highly thought of, and I understand that Belgian Ale is supposed to be on a higher plane in the beer world. I'm sorry but I don't agree. I consider myself to have a wide range of tastes and I'm very open minded of beer like all of you advocates out there. I even went out and bought a goblet that is appropriate for this style of beer. Dark brown color was nice and different, however I was very surprised by the lack of lacing. Taste was full of yeast, fruit and I think clove. Carbonation a bit more than I am used to. A good beer for sipping on a cold night and maybe I'll like Belgians more someday but for now I'll try the one I still have in the fridge (Piraat) and If that dosen't do it for me, see ya."
"With me being a big fan on Unibroue, i really wanted to try this beer. I was happy to see when i was pouring a nice dark ale, or what i thought. I smelled some yeast, so i was really geared up to drink this. It took about 15 mins to pour the bottle with letting the head to settle down,but when i took my first sip, all i tasted was fruit, which made it somewhat hard for me to drink, since i am not that big on fruity beers. Very strong peppery flavour. I only sampled one of these 750ml corked bottles, right when i was starting to try belgian-style brews. I will try this again, and possibly re-do the entire review. But for the people who love fruit beers, grab this one right away."
"750 ml corked bottle Dark orange brown color, big thick clingy head, sweet fruity, bready aroma, full bodied, alcohol hidden very well, smooth and velvety this is a great belgian strong ale, very drinkable."
"Formidably thick, creamy, and stiff beige head akin to chocolate dusted egg whites beat to a soft peak. Hazy garnet hue. Sweet lemony citrus and perfume like sweetness upfront in aroma w/ a hint of fragrant pine. Pleasantly mild green apple acetaldehyde is secondary. Hints of raisin and trace chocolate emerge as the beer breathes. Trace phenol in aroma. Date like fruity fructose sweetness is perceptible at first, then is supplemented by lightly raisiny, dark caramel sweetness. The initially sugary fruitiness widens into a ripe, prune nature that melds well with the understated chocolate character. Clean in terms of yeast byproucts, with only a trace of clove present in flavor. Light in body and correspondingly light, but certainly not weak, in mouthfeel. Hop bitterness is appropriately light, and only barely offsets malt sweetness. Finishes clean, w/ sweetness briefly lingering on the tip of the tongue. Although Trois Pistoles is not the most complex example of the style, its overall soft, pleasantly sweet character lend it unparalleled drinkability. Superbly masked alcohol content. Highly enjoyable. This was a 12 ounce bottle. ...Perhaps one of the finest beers with a twist off cap. I look forward to eventually trying a well cellared 750 ml bottle."
"Good with casseroled mushrooms, baked onions, tongue..."
"A very good beer from Unibroue."
"This is certainly a change of pace from the beer I'm used to drinking (Lots of HopDevil and Shakespeare Stout).  I bought a four pack of Duvel one time and I hated it.  I poured one of them out because I thought they were skunked.  This beer tastes similar but way better.  I'm not sure if these beers I've been getting are skunked, or is it's that I'm just not used to the flavor of Belgian beers.  Do they all have a certain sourish medicinal quality to them? Help me out here someone.  Anyway, this stuff is pretty carbonated and has the malty characteristics of a stout except this beer is not very heavy at all.  It is quite drinkable and has a decent ABV that will sneak up on you.  I've had better beers but it's still pretty good."
"smells fruity, and has a slight fruity flavor in the backround. it is dominated by sweet malts. it goes down incredibly smooth and is a wonder to drink. this is a belgian ale, and everyone should have it."
"P.S.  Oh yeah, dont be blasphemous and drink this ice cold, okay?"
"Trois Pistoles pours a deep ruby, amber color with a big, frothy tan head which retains well. Nice Brussels lace is present with some yeast particles floating about. Notes of yeast and spices are present in the nose. Taste varies from sweet to tart, acidic to spicy. Notes of fruit, yeast, spicy hops and alcohol present themselves nicely. Mouthfeel is appropriately carbonated, leaving an almost prickly sensation on the tongue. A choice sipping beer, this is a keeper."
"Some months later, EXTREMELY smooth, drinkability is raised to 5..."
"The taste was very complex, with deep rich malt tastes like licorice, dried fruits, and anise.  The alcohol was noticeable throughout, from the aroma, throughout the taste and the warmth thereafter.  Not bad, but not worth the money I paid."
"Deep chestnut brown with dark amber highlights topped by a creamy white head.  This is an impressive looking beer, with an equally impressive bottle.  The aroma is very complex, with yeast, fruits, and other scents.  Reminds me of a ggod red wine.  The taste is sweet, fruity and slightly overpowering.  I did not find it to be as well balanced as some of the other Unibroue offerings.  The mouthfeel is good, but the alcohol is a little too prevalent, creating too much astringency on the finish.    Not many people could have more than a couple of these in an evening.  Another nice beer from Unibroue that I must purchase again."
"This is one great beer, the dark mahogany appearance is pleasing and the tan creamy head with a nice lace all the way through adds to it.  IMO the aroma had a sweet hoppy scent to it.  Good mouthfeel that makes you want to savor it and an excelelnt taste. ABV kikcs in a little but not overwhelming and I could drink this beer alone or with a nice med rare steak.  Beautiful labe also as all the Unibroue beers have.....CHEERS"
"Really, this beer is just outstanding. Big, complex, balanced...one of the best in world, without a doubt."
"Like the horse on the label, this beer swirls around my head after two. A very down to earth taste, almost as if a monk was brewing it for you next door. This will be a cold weather beer for me, its rich hoppiness ans spices warming my cocals on a snowy night. My second favorite from Unibrou, drinking it almost makes you feel like a rebel."
"Pours with a large foamy head over amber/red liquid. Nose is very fruity, almost grape-like, and sweet smelling too. Taste is sweet as well, with a Port wine-like tanginess, heavy on the maltiness without being cloying. Very unique tasting with some hops detected in the finish. Warming alcohol noted as well. This seems to be a good candidate for cellaring, perhaps some time would dry things out a bit...I just couldn't get too excited about it now though."
"Dense head that quickly settles to a solid quarter inch or so.  Deep mahogony color.  Amazingly complex nose of malt, sour cherry, and blackberry.  Simply mouthfilling, with wonderful fruity notes on top of the beautiful malty base.  Great length.  Outstanding beer.  9% alcohol not apparent at all.  This bottle was cellared for about 2.5 years at 62 degrees."
"I have found my god. It's lives in all bottles of Trois Pistoles -- 3 year old bottles, but godly nonetheless."
"wow.  this is really really good.    a ton of head, but lots of flavour for it to hold.   and excellent dark appearance, with a good dose of peppery spice over the fruity flavour.  Yes, the alcohol's there, but it's the good type of strong.  I really liked this beer.   .... now to find some magnums of it."
"Huge head with cavernous pockets and oversized bubbles.  This is a very pretty beer.  Typical yeasty Belgian smell.  Taste is of dark berries with a peppery characteristic.  Mild alcohol taste that's well meshed with the taste.  This is a winner."
"Cloudy brown/amber with a persistant lace.  Fruity and spicy aroma, with buscuity notes as well.  Flavor is malty and sweet, with a hint of dried fruit.  Very crisp and carbonated for a Dark Strong Ale.  Definately a potent, sipping beer, with a nice warming effect. This is one I'll return to on many occasions.  Another strong Unibroue offering."
"Wow. There's really a lot going on in this beer.  Very drinkable, very mellow.  This one definitely goes on the monthly rotation."
"Pours a  amber / brown color with a thin tan lace. On the nose you can smell the aroma of caramel malt, toasted bread smell, and alcohol. On the palate the you more malt caramel, toasted bread, chocolate hints, dark fruits, slight graininess. Alcohol taste goes away as it warms and caramel malt steps upfront and complex flavors as well. Good stuff"
"This may sound odd but the flavor reminded me a bit of watermelon. Maybe it was the esters combined with some of the other yeasty flavors but it was interesting. Smells like a good belgian should. Not as spicy as some, but the estery fruitiness is good. Having trouble with some of the spicier belgians, this is a good beer to me. It had less of the fuzzy mouthfeel that a lot of Belgians have. I think that's a good thing as some feel too fuzzy."
"Now here we go!  Finally, I've hit a Unibroue product that I rate beyond good.  This brew pours a dark chocolate color with a light tan 3 finger head.  Fairly hoppy brew but not over-hopped for the style and alcohol content.  At 9% ABV, you know that you drank something.  The taste is well balanced with a sweet finish and the mouthfeel is great.  It is fairly thick without alot of stickiness.  This one is done right!  A votre sante again!"
"Tried it a second time and got a complete different taste and aroma than the first time. Just a fantastic beer. Don't know what happened the first time, but, a complete change this time. I've gone for a 3 average to a 4."
"The bottle says that it has a port like finish and it does. This dark colored strong ale would be great for sipping in front of the fire on a cold winter night. Has a leathery taste with hints of dried prune fruitiness. You can feel the warmth of the alcohol but does not overpower the other flavors. Finishes somewhat dry in the mouth. Had this with some Chinese food and it cut the greasiness wonderfully. Not my favorite Unibroue beer and I would not seek it out on a regular basis, but this is a decent strong ale."
"Fruity/yeasty nose with a hint of sweetness.  Dark cloudy black cherry color.  Lots of little bubbles from bottle conditioning.  Fruity original taste with a smooth spicey finish.  Very well crafted, with a finish that leaves your tongue ready for more sparkle and a little alcohol warmth.  The original feel is one of action and the finish is smooth and balanced.  There ia alot going on here, but that is what is so impressive.  There is a very fine light lace on the glass.  Curl up with a bottle and enjoy the complexity.  This vintage was listed best before: 5/8/04.  Tasted in chimay goblet."
"This could very well be my favorite Unibroue (at least so far, anyway). Deep hazy garnet with an ultra-foamy tan head. Smells of apples and cloves, with a touch of pepper. Smooth, fruity, spicy taste, with a bit of an alcohol burn in the finish (quite nice, actually). The overall effect is quite warming and pleasant. Yum! I continue to be very impressed with these guys."
"I have to give BA credit for introducing me to Unibroue. Trois Pistoles was the first Unibroue offering that I tried. Dark color, creamy head, multi fruit flavor, belgian strong ale is becoming a new favorite."
"Big grape aroma (fresh red grapes).  The aroma is unlike any other I have encountered in beer.  Alcohol flavor is present and it offers a dry finish.  Slight lactic acid sourness accompanies a very winey (Sangria?) flavor."
"dark brown color, think foamy brown head. The head settled quickly but was still very good. Smelled alot of spices and fruit. noticable alcohol and very very smooth for the higher abv. Very sweet on the tongue and almost no bitterness. Not a beer to down several at a time, but very very good. The taste improved as it warmed in the glass. Cool looking bottle too. Exp. date is 9/4/04 Wow."
"Pours with a nice foamy head and is a nice garnet in the glass.  A raisin/date smell and taste are fruity but not overwhelmingly so.  The flavor is complex, and Unibroue's comparison to port is not far off.  Although I gave up cigars a few years back, this one would probably go well with a full-bodied Churchill."
"Very poor, thin, cloying, slightly sweet, and just nothing happening at all, i'm sorry if everyone else liked it, but i didn't, did nothing for me."
"Another good beer from Unibroue.  Pours with a large dark brown head.  The beer is a clear dark brown color.  Smells of alcohol and dried fruit, very nice.  Tastes of raisins and dates, alcohol present throughout but not overpowering.  Some gingerbread spiciness in the finish.  Medium body.  Warms you up nicely."
"Another incredible beer from Unibroue. This beer has it all great color, aroma, taste and drinkabilty. The 9% a.b.v isn't noticable when it is cold but when it gets to room temperature look out."
"81"
"Notes: Another spectacular brew from one of the best breweries from Canada. Big enough to pair up with the most robust meals or just to sip the cold winter months away. Packed with complex flavours and deviously drinkable at 9% abv."
"Quite an stellar brew in my book, and just a step below their some of their other offerings (Don, Fin and Maudite).  Usually a ""second-tier"" beer in a brewery's repitoire is nothing to get overly excited about.  But Unibroue is an exception to all rules.  Everything they touch is gold."
"I really enjoyed this beer, one of my favorites of the Unibroue line. Has an almost sherry like aftertaste with smooth body. I didn't find that the alchohol was very pronounced. Excellent."
"What a smooth beer.  I have not tasted a full bodied dark Belgian style ale that was this smooth.  It had a creamy texture that made this a wonderful beer to sit and sip all night"
"Dark cloudy brown color.  Beige head. A complex, spicy aroma with a hint of yeast, fruit and vanilla.  Definitely a sipping beer.  Dark fruit, vanilla, chocolate and caramel notes with a strong alcoholic finish. Lingering malty, fruity, alcoholic aftertaste. A tad too much alcohol and carbonation for the mix."
"Huge complexity in flavor. Sip, savour, enjoy."
"Very assertive and no-nonsense, with lots of caramel and alcohol notes."
