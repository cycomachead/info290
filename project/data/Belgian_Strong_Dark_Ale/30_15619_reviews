"Even the high alcohol content couldn't hide the awful after taste of this one!!"

"O: I really dig this beer.  Big, bold, boozy, flavorful.  Very well done.  4.25"
""
"I think I'll definitely be getting another of these in the future. Throuroughly enjoyed."
"Overall:  Not a style I usually partake of, but this was a pretty nice experience.  Probably would not purchase on my own but glad I tried it."

"it tastes like Iâ€™m drinking a big ball of cinnamon pancake batter dipped in whiskey; that is all..."
""
"O: A big beer for sure.  Tasty, but a little hot."
"Harsh, chemical-like alcohol taste. Not sure what they were going for here."
""
"Pours clear dark amber with nice head. Aromas are raisin, alcohol heat, molasses, red fruit. Flavors are similar with the heat dissipating with time."
"Very sweet and still has a bit of alcohol to it. Very fruity. Probably past but nice to try."

"Batch 9. 2011. February 2015. Four years in the bottle, and still feels new. Had only one bottle and wish I had kept it longer. The hops has begun to drop out, allowing a ton of stuff to go on with the many sugars in this witches' brew. Molasses in the nose and entrance, candy sugar and raisin sugar are prominent, and black strap is strong on the long finish. Pretty sure I'm growing new chest hair as I write this. Reminiscent of Sierra Nevada Bigfoot after a few years, but oh so much bigger than even that. Passes the Big Beer smell test with flying colors."
"Not one of Avery's best, it just seems extreme for the sake of being extreme."
"It's good, I liked this"
"2014 Vintage. Very strong brew. I feel it might be necessary to grab another bottle, age it for two or three years, and enjoy it then. Despite the strength, I sat with this beer for a good hour and a half and enjoyed each small sip I took. No rush. Why rush with a good beer?"

"Great beer,crew is great for the price"

"Had a generous sample of this at my local taphouse. $15 a pint kept me from going all in. It was a very interesting brew. Do I have to tell you that it is really big? Notes of a high-octane Flanders Red on the nose... big warm alcohol bite on the back red of the palate. Bravo to Avery for aiming high. In this style, prefer the lower ABV fare as they are more delicately balanced. This is worth a try, by far, but I don't think it would become a regular fridge stocker (as if I could find it)."
"I received a bottle from the 2013 batch. It was delicious to my taste but a little hard in the bite for my wife."
""
""
"2014 Edition: Poured a seethru light brown body with one finger head and lace ring .  Aroma is dark fruit filled with raisins, figs, even plums, and I do get a bit of the honey (thanks, label) and chocolate...and some booze, natch.  Thick bodied, slow drinker thanks to stickiness and this beer will give off a little booze with a hot finish.  Dark fruits make up most of taste as I get raisins, prunes, figs in the beer and there is a bready, cracker like dryness to the beer that adds balance as well as touches of caramel and toffee sweetness.  I like this beer but there are not hops for more balance and I think the alcohol mutes a little bit of the fruit and sweet tastes so not my one of my favorites (the price doesn't help)."
"Excellent and worth trying again.  Avery has never let me down."
"O - This is a great beer.  Although it hits extremes in alcohol level, hops and oxidation, altogether the impression is of a balanced and enjoyable beer."
""

"O - 1.5 - I've, so far at least, noticed a trend with the Avery ""Demons of Ale"" series. THEY NEED TO TONE IT DOWN A LITTLE! I understand these are supposed to be these MASSIVE, monstrous beers that have huge ABVs and flavors. I LOVE when brewerys do this kind of thing, I'm REALLY into massive and experimental brews. But even with massive beers, you HAVE to have BALANCE. Balance is the theme of the lesson here. You can talk a pretty game and have awesome curb appeal with your label art, described flavors and massive ABV, but if you aren't properly balancing your two MAIN aspects of flavor, the salt and pepper of beer, sweetness and bitterness, then you've done your entire effort a massive disservice. This could be an absolutely astounding brew, and perhaps its somewhat my fault for not aging it long enough, but I can't imagine, even with multiple years that this amount of cloying sweetness could be toned down. If you see this brew and you are compelled to grab it, let it age for many a year!"
""
""
""
"Overall:  Jesus, what a spectacular, amazing, exceptionally, awesome beer!  Avery has knocked it out of the park with this one!"
"Drank the 2013 version on tap first. Fell in love with it..2014 is great just a little smaller kick."

"2007 vintage. Totally kick ass. Very complex. Lots of raison and date with a little caramel. Very subtle alcohol for  16+abv. Highly recommend."
"tastes like an english barleywine without the bitterness, this is indeed a beast of a beer, take it 4 oz at a time folks, with the stature though it kinda goes a little beyond a pleasant enjoyable beer bc, even with time to enjoy this beer, shitfaced or a least a heavy buzz are non optional"

"Overall I thought this was a nice beer and a nice example of the style, the Belgian aspects came through even though it was pretty much dominated by the sweetness there were still some nice flavors and aromas that showed up.  This beer didn't have good drinkability, it was not the smoothest, a little crisp, fairly cloying, slightly sticky, very warming, slightly filling and the taste did an ok job of holding my attention, but I think half the bottle is a good amount for me, anymore than that and it might really start to wear on me, especially the warming aspect.  What I like the most about this beer was the appearance and the Belgian Strong Dark Ale aspects that came through, to me those were the highlights of this beer.  What I like the least about this beer was the sweetness and the mouthfeel, those two aspects need some work.  I wouldn't buy this beer again, I'm glad I tried it, but I see no need to revisit it anytime soon and I would only recommend it if you like really sweet and strong beers.  All in all I liked the beer, but didn't love it and in the end it was the sweetness that really held this beer back.  It isn't a favorite Avery beer or a favorite of the style, it falls in the middle in both aspects.  I appreciate the effort it took to make this beer, but in the end it's just not for me, better luck next time guys."

"I'm not always a fan of Belgian-style beers, but this one was satisfying and one I would drink again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I think if I was going to buy this one again I would probably let it sit for 2.5-3 years. I probably should have let it sit longer, but I forgot to double check my notes from the 14 month tasting before cracking this one. I don't know if the flavors I'm getting a strictly alcohol based, but it feels pretty hot still."

"This is certainly a beast... in a good way, I just hate to say that. Has an Old Ale feel for the most part but also brings a lot of complex dark sugars, a slight fruity feel and Belgian yeast spice."

"The beer tastes towards an aged American barleywine that Belgian style brew. The alcohol is extremely well hidden for its over 15% ABV."
"O - I like this beer.  Definitely a cold weather drink for me.  I kind of wish I was sitting outside around a fire.  With the high alcohol it has a warming feel as you drink it."

"Pours a very dark amber/red with very little head.  The aroma was strong dark fruits, vanilla and bourbon.  The taste matched the smell, with the alcohol very prominent along with fig, apricot and date flavors.  The mouthfeel was pretty nice and smooth, considering the high abv. Overall this was a pretty good beer, although a little heavy on the burn side."

"Deep, dark ruby explosion of fruity complexity covered with a thin layer of lacy foam.. Sip slowly and allow it to warm as the high alcohol warms you. Savor each drop for its multiple fruit flavors; plums, dates, raisins and figs. Full bodied and port like. Make sure you have time to settle in and relax while you enjoy this one."
""
"Batch 8. Pours a deep dark red orange. Aroma is sweet dark fruit, dried plumes, Belgian yeast and honey notes, citrus and orange marmalade. Taste is a combination of all the aforementioned aromas and nuances. Palate is a full rich body, slight creaminess and full flavored. The finishes is a combination of sweet caramel malt, Belgian yeast, fruity notes of dried fruit plums and honey followed a good kick of bitter hops and a good punch of alcohol on the end. Aroma becomes overwhelming as it warms up. Overall seems A bit too strong for my taste."

"The beast is a monster! Heavy-duty malt character, strongly sweet yet very bearable, especially when bounced off the huge ABV. Wild, complex, huge depth with flavors and mouthfeel. Personally, I don't mind drinking these kind of beers year-round, but this would really make for an awesome cold weather/holiday beer."

"Cloudy mahogany color yielded a tan smooth head. Nose is quite loaded with fig. Do get some caramel, mint leaves and alcohol. The nose translates the taste as this is a Fig bomb. I do get a mint and caramel background with a boozy finish. The feel is thick and alcohol laden. Just not my style, big and bold, but just not for me."

"O: This beer is nearly 5 years old, and I'm happy that I did not drink it in the last year since I had it. I'm curious to try other Avery demon-line beers that have been aged this long as this one was such a great sample. I would like to do some additional vertical tastings, but that requires getting several people involved due to the large character of these beers."

"If the booze wasn't so prominent this could be a really excellent beer. It has some fine characters of caramel malts, licorice, burnt wood, and overripe fruit. Definitely a beer to have on a special occasion rather than on a daily basis. This will set you out for a loop."

"Well, then - this seems like the ungodly stepchild of the biggest, baddest BSDA, and an even bigger, badder American Strong Ale, the kind of attractive urchin that lures you in, settles your nerves, and then BAM! - blood and weakly scripted chaos reign. Anyways, one hell of a strong ale, Belgian-influenced or otherwise, where the grandiosity of the kitchen sink approach is somehow more than enough to ward off the liqueur-esque ABV. Yeah."

"I first tried this back in college, mostly for its then-ridiculous ABV. It was very hard to put down. Now, a few years later, I feel I can tame this Beast... It pours a deep auburn-ruby topped by a small sheeting of off-khaki foam. The nose comprises rich caramel, booze, a melange of dark and stone fruits, and an underlying strata of straight barley. It's all a bit much, with the booze really muddling things up, but it's not hard to deal with. The taste brings in more of the same, with the booze coming through stronger than expected and mixing with some candied orange peel for a strong, boozy, and bitter flavor; this leads the way for some grainy sweetness and a touch of toast. The body is fairly hefty, with a rather light moderate carbonation and a drying finish. Overall, this is indeed a beast, perhaps too much of one to really allow the flavors to coalesce without the undue influence of the booze. It's truly not bad, just not something I'd really wanna drink again."
""
"I'm going to have to pass on the rest of this one. Couldn't finish it. I was hoping this beer would age like Samael does, but unfortunately it's just a different beast."

"O: A boozy beer with some fruit and spice that has a high enough alcohol content that you'll want to share. It shows little signs of mellowing in the past few years. The flavors make more sense after reading the bottle that it was brewed with honey malt and actual honey."

"Overall â€“ Thick of a hot boozy and mediciney flavor; this is a very sweet and slow sipper indeed. It is rather odd, while it has some more off characteristics like the medicine flavor and huge sweetness, somehow it goes together to make something rather palatable and somewhat enjoyable. While not one I would ever want to frequent, it is one I think that should be experienced, and one to come to every so often when you feel like something intense and hot."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- A Beast indeed. As long as one's not put off by a sweet, heavy brew, this is certainly worth trying. I'd definitely consider picking up and stowing a few away, but I wouldn't crack one very often. One to savor, heavier and boozier than some of the other uber-strong ales on the market but unique and assertive enough to be worth revisiting."
"The beer pours a very creamy off-white head that dissipates quickly. The beer itself is an opaque plum purple with a bit of red notes. The beer smell has strong dark fruit notes such as plum with a bit of raisin and honey notes. The smell also has a slight hint of alcohol to it. The taste is very strong compared to the smell. The beer has strong dark fruit notes and raisins in addition to an alcohol note that gives a little burn and improves the sweet flavor from the other notes. The honey also makes an appearance in the aftertaste. The mouthfeel is fairly smooth but still a little thick to the tongue. The carbonation is minimal, which allows the beer to be pretty smooth. Overall, the beer is pretty good and not too bad even though there are better strong dark ales. The flavors mix well enough to provide a fairly fruity and sweet beer that is worth getting again."

"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, 2005 vintage. Pours a cloudy very dark reddish brown color with a small dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a thin lace that lingers. Slight spotty foamy lacing on the glass. Aromas of huge raisin, prune, fig, toast, toffee, chocolate, molasses, earth, licorice, tobacco, honey, dark bread, candi sugar, and light earthy yeast esters. Incredible and highly complex aromas with great balance and strength. Taste of big raisin, prune, fig, toffee, molasses, toast, dark bread, earth, tobacco, candi sugar, honey, light licorice, light hop spiciness, and light earthy yeast esters. Lingering notes of dark fruits, toffee, molasses, toast, dark bread, earth, tobacco, light licorice, candi sugar, honey, and earthy spiciness on the finish for a while. Damn nice malty flavor balance with big complexity; with a good balance of maltiness with light earthy spiciness; and slight lingering sweetness on the finish, that is minimally cloying. Light carbonation and very full bodied; with a creamy, slick, and syrupy mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is extremely well hidden at 15% with only a moderate warming noticed after the finish; definitely a sipper. Overall this is a highly excellent Belgian strong dark ale. Huge flavor complexity and balance of malty flavors; and very smooth to sip on slowly. A very enjoyable offering with this amount of age, though I have never tried it fresh."

"O â€“ This is a really nice beer and actually much better than I thought it was going to be. It has a very high ABV at 16.83%, but it ends up being very drinkable. It is decently complex, very sweet, and pretty tasty. Unfortunately for this beer score-wise, it happens to be a member of a style that holds some of the best, most complex beers in the world. So while the score may not reflect how good the beer is (I rate in reference to style always), this is definitely a very good beer."

""
""
""
""
"O - Great balance for a beer of this size. I would enjoy another of these in the future, granted I could never dream of throwing back a pair."
"This is probably the best beer I've ever had. It's intensely sweet, but it makes up for it by having a malt character reminiscent of scotch and by tasting like many different dried fruits at once. The typical raisin/prune flavour still dominates, though. This is the ultimate sipping beer. I need to get another one to do a better review, but I needed to leave something here so I'd remember how amazing this was."

"O - This has held up surprisingly well. I can't say I feel inspired to buy any more of this, but I'm glad I finally caved in to try it. I feel like this beer is just over the hill."
"Pours jet black with a teeny tiny brown head even with a relatively aggressive pour. Aroma of heavy bourbon and more vanilla than I have smelled in a barrel aged before. Small bit of roasted grain. Bourbon flavor explodes on the palate up front even more than I expected. Lasting vanilla & cocoa after swallowing that is pretty intense. As it fades there is an additional punch of chocolate and hint of espresso out of nowhere. Very complex. Heavy on the palate, very warming. Just the right level of sweetness. Want more..."

"Drinking from a 4-oz snifter; still, good head...half inch; still fizzing as it sits; dark cherry in color; says its made with 6 hops, 6 sugars, 6 malts; smells very malty, sweet; on a first sip, it's got serious punch; tastes ALOT like Samiclaus; very cherry sweet; has a bread flavor on the backend, oddly enough; I can't get over the malt taste in it; love the experimentation here, although there's a flavor profile that is a little bitter; this has to be the last beer I try here...it's a palate destroyer!"
""
"OVERALL: For a lot of breweries this would be their best effort by leaps and bounds. In Avery's case, it is not their best, but it is an excellent showcase of what they can do with malt. Of course, it still has 63 IBUs. Great celebration beer. Grab a couple bottles and save them for future Christmas gatherings, that would be the perfect time to break them out."

"B+/A- (major points for subdued alcohol w/aging and nice melding of sweet date and caramel flavors, esp. since this was not cellared under anything like ideal conditions for 2 of its 4 years)"
""
"Overall this is not the beer for me. I thought I'd like it, having very much enjoyed JW Lees harvest ales but this beer seemed considerably less balanced. There are some great flavors but they just get overpowered by the body and alcohol."
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a snifter, July 2012 release. This pours a dark mahogany brown, with a surprisingly large (for the abv) tan head which has a longer than expected retention which leaves a lacing. Right away on the nose I get a big load of alcohol, the potency of this isn't hidden, there is a little vanilla and some caramel but its hard to smell past the alcohol. The feel is mostly thick. The taste is okay, the alcohol burn is very present and that's the dominate taste, beyond that you get some sweetness, but its all secondary to the alcohol."
""
""

""

"batch 10. pours a caramel color without much carbonation and a very noticable density wel above normal brews. it smells like booze, very sweet, like molasses and brewing sugars. there is also some whiskey characteristics to it, charcoal and vanilla. the flavor is very very sweet, much more of a spirit than a beer i feel like. there is some definite spice to it behind the sweet, the alcohol is intense, and there is a sugary film left in the mouth after each sip. its really potent, but its not overwhelming until it warms up to room temp, then it can be pretty punishing. its a nice beer to share after dinner, but not something you drink several of to your head. avery has got these big beers pretty well dialed, but this is perhaps my least favorite of the bunch, just due to the crazy sugar levels."
"O: This is a decent beer, but nothing crazy. I would for sure try it again if I had the chance, but I wont go out of my way to get it though."
""
""
""
""
""
"This is definitely a sipping beer. Let it age to mellow out the alcohol and share with friends."
""
"Overall, just too strong. Perhaps I could appreciate the flavours more if the booze was tuned down, but as it is this is just not very enjoyable. Also too sweet."
"I'll admit that I like sweet beers, and those who don't might find this one unpalatable. But there's so much to it, so much variety in those sugars, that I find it hard not to like. And I honestly cannot imagine a beer that better masks its alcohol."

"I can see where there going with this one and perhaps I'm not doing it any justice drinking it ""fresh"" (6 months old), the booze is killing the good qualities but it's still a pretty decent beer today. Yet another big thank you to Rutager for killing another want from my list, I need to make a new want list after trading with him because he killed it"

"Pours a murky brown with a foamy khaki head that settles to an oily film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, dark fruit, and somewhat intense alcohol aromas. Taste is the same with some oxidized flavors and a fruity finish. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer but itâ€™s quite strong and oxidized at this point."

"Poured into a 20 oz Duvel tulip, bottled in 2009. Poured aggressively and got a large 2 inch off white, that leaves some lacing. The beer is a cloudy brownish red. Smell is strong brown sugar, fig, prunes, banana bread, and some booze. Taste is very pungent burnt brown sugar, dark fruits, banana bread, and warming alcohol. Body is large, good amount of carbonation for its massive ABV, a little dry, and a sipper for sure. This is a hybrid beer, quadish/english barleywine, not my favorite flavors. Love Mephistopheles, Meph Addict, Samael Ale, but not this one."
""
"Batch 6. Bottle to tulip. Looks okay; brown and opaque with very little head. Smells pretty good; sweet and BOOZY! Tastes a little too strong for my liking. It's like a BB barleywine that is lacking balance. Mouthfeel is average, even for the high abv. Overall, I'm glad I got to try it, but I wouldn't seek it out again."

""
"The best thing about this beer is the cool looking bottle"
"O - As good as a Grand cru can get in my opinion. 16% ABV is well hidden, but it definitely hits your head by the end. I think aging this beer did alot for it. The sweet malts and belgian yeast dominate."

"I see what this beer is going for and it fails. The problem is it is completely unrestrained and unrefined. Truly a beast."

"Pours a dark dark redish black color with absolutely no head to speak of. Starting off poorly. The beer is absolutely dead, no bubbles at all. The smell is similar to the un-aged version with a little more sweetness and a more well rounded smell, still harsh and not welcoming at all. Honestly I was really scared to try this beer but wow, well done Avery. The taste is nothing like the harsh smell, there is a nice vanilla/creamy taste to this beer that is unusual with a grand cru. Smooth taste throughout with a kick of the alcohol at the end, being a 15.7% it drinks so much easier than that. With trying both the 2011 release and now the 2004 I would recommend aging this beer for sure. The mouthfeel is about what you would expect from a beer with such high alcohol, you get an oily residue throughout the mouth after tasting, which is not a bad thing. Overall this beer surprised me 100%, I love Avery and am upset that they pulled out of Indiana but as far as this label is concerned I did not enjoy the 2011 release but am really enjoying the 2004 release. Age this beer if you have the means."

"The aptly named Beast pours like oil, raisin-y in color, syrup-y in complexion. A huge bouquet of booze and caramel streams from the glass. It smells extremely sweet and boozy, like a liquor. But the taste doesn't follow - still strong and 'beastly', but there's nuance and subtlety. Raisin sweetness meets a buttery creaminess meets a touch of floral hop astringency. The alcohol warms, but for 17%? It's actually quite balanced and drinkable. It does have a sticky complexion...I think there's a bit still stuck between my teeth. But damn, surprisingly quaffable for such an extreme beverage."
"Appearance is light brown with an orange hue. There is a finger of head with little appreciable retention, but some nice lacing left behind. Pineapples and oranges in the nose make for a promising offering. The mouthfeel is thick with a flavor of sweet raisins and molasses dominating. There is a slight alcohol bitterness at the finish, but it is hardly noticeable considering the high ABV of this offering. There is a little pepper flavor at the end as well. This is a perfect beer for sipping by the fire with your sweetheart and a rich and sweet desert."

"Poured from 12oz bottle (Batch #9 - August 2011 release). Only available in 619 cases. Pours a cloudy nut brown with almost no head. Aroma is mostly booze but also has some dried dark fruits, a little Belgian sugar and a little caramel. Taste is heavily sweet. Has a huge alcohol burn with a good bit of Belgian sugar, caramel, raisins, molasses, and dark fruit. Some bourbon barrel wood and a little vanilla in there too. Almost reminds me of a less sweet port wine. Full bodied with a thick texture. Soft carbonation and a long finish. Overall, an interesting beer that complements well with the Mephistopheles' Stout."

"O- This is a big sugary but not cloying sweet, bright beer with big alcohol heat that is a bit to hot but welcome in these arctic conditions. Age would do this wonders but it has a very nice complexity now."
"Overall: Very good. Rich and complex flavors, but the heat makes it tough. Thanks to my brother Ben for the Christmas gift."
"This is a very flavorful beer with many intricacies and complexities. Ultimately, it loses some points for me because it's overly boozy. The flavors are great, but can't stand up to the overpowering alcohol. With that being said, I enjoyed it, and I look forward to more in the future."

"O - 6 years of aging. 5.5 in the bottle shop and .5 in my cellar. I haven't had this beer without aging, so I don't have a good comparison, but for the high ABV, it is very smooth and I can only imagine the sweetness has increased as the alcohol has mellowed over the years."

"A HUGE BSDA that is truly a demonic gift."
"This is what amazing beer is meant to be. Bottle was from 2007 and enjoyed Dec 2011. Amazing mouthfeel. Shared with a person who is new to ""good"" beer and they almost fainted. Dark beautiful and thick, it pours without much head but with good carb. Strong notes of dark candy and malt. This is the kind of beer I want to curl up with in the end of days."
"This is a hard beer to drink, the definitive slow sipper, and I didn't find it to have many of the complex and interesting flavors other beers of this nature do. Still it is worth trying, especially if you like your beers sweet."

"Pours a dark brown color with crimson highlights. For 16.83% ABV, I was surprised that there was a one finger cocoa head, and good lacing. The nose is raisin, fig, molasses, some grain, and a whiff of alcohol. Very nice, and the alcohol doesn't overwhelm. The taste is good, but it's obviously a young beer that should be aged more than I have. The nose profile comes through with a little bit of honey sweetness added. Nice alcohol burn on the aftertaste, which sticks around for a while. Feel is full, with a malty backbone and an alcohol bite on the backside. Overall, this is a very enjoyable beer- definitely a sipper. I imagine the taste and feel score would go up with 3 or 4 years on it. Still, I would buy this again. Cheers."

"2004 bottle of batch ONE. Direct from Adam Averyâ€™s cellar to my friend, to my glass, to my mouth. 22 oz bomber pours Dark brown with light bubbly off white head. Incredible rich caramel aroma, hints of chocolate and bread. Full bodied, super sweet. Rich and well balanced with a deep molasses finish. Almost LIke a rich English barley wine with a belgian yeast underneath. This has aged incredibly well and it feels like it could hold up for a few more years at least. Definitely appreciative to have tried this batch one."
""

"o - Overall a decent beer, but way too sweet in the taste. Alcohol is there but not as bad as I expected; may be due to it being 2 years old. Worth trying and probably ages well, but a bit too sweet for me."

""
""
"Final thought - $8 a pop and 17% abv? What!?! Awesome!"
"Poured on draft into a 9 oz. snifter at TJ's Anniversary event. Pours a beautiful ruby gold with a thin veil of a head. The nose is unsurprisingly boozy with loads of caramel, vanilla, and more booze. The taste is sweet. Way sweet. More caramel, toffee, and sweet whatever. The mouth is. Ery smooth with a touch of heat on the finish. Overall...very nice."
"O: Another big beer winner from Avery. Worthy of another purchase to drink now or cellar."

"Delicious monstrous brew, doesn't even try to hide the booze. Definite sipper, and flavor-wise much more like a barley wine than a Belgian dark. Definitely would have again, but slowly."
"This beer pours a deep reddish copper color. It has a finger of off-white head on top. The head recedes pretty quickly leaving just a few specs of lace behind. The nose has a big fruity aroma and a nice sweetness to it. There are some scents of dark fruit and some alcohol presence as well. The taste starts off with some nice dark fruit flavors. There are flavors of fig, plum, cherry, and raisin. There is some hop flavor and some booziness. It has a syrupy sweetness, but it isn't too much. The finish leaves some lingering fruity sweetness, light hop flavor, and a bit of booziness. This has a fully body and low carbonation. It has a smooth mouthfeel that has a bit of a chewy quality to it. It is sweet and there is some bitterness to it. There is also some alcohol heat here as well, which is to be expected. This has good drinkability. It is a sipper, but the flavor is great. I really enjoyed this beer. It has a deep sweet fruitiness that I really enjoyed. Overall, I think this is an awesome beer, and I recommend trying it."
"O - Definitely a Beast of a beer, but a surprisingly smooth, complex sipper!"
"I enjoyed this, and would seek it out again as a great sipping beer."
"This beer poured out similar to the Samuel, the color was a dark brownish amber. With a small thin head on top. There isn't much lacing from the head but the beer itself is thick and coats the glass lightly with a swirl of the glass. The smell of the beer is also very boozy and sweet smelling. The taste of the beer has a oaky sweetness to it with a slight tart flavor in there too. The beer has a big amount of complexity to it. It goes through several changes from start to finish. The mouthfeel of this beer was pretty thick feeling and smooth. Oily and dry as well. Overall it's a pretty intense brew. Fits well in this series."
"O- Not my thing, its just far too sweet. Maybe because of the aging, I'll definetly have to try this fresh to test it out."
"O: The Beast Grand Cru is interesting, but is a heavy, ponderous beer even by quadrupel/strong dark ale standards. Drinkability is low and sessionability is completely nonexistent. I'm glad I tried it, but it is definitely one of those once a year types."
"O: This is a perfect beer to share after a hearty dinner, to serve as a dessert drank in wine glasses like you might take a good porto. Drinking alone might get you a little tipsy, as one of these bottles packs the punch of about 3-4 normal beers. In short, this beer is a great wine."
"O- Truly a ""beast"" of a beer. I'd love to see what an extra few years could do to it. Fits in the Demon Series nicely. Enjoying this slow sipper."
"O - Like a shot of Tequila, you can feel it all the way down. An awesome brew, it just needs a moment or two to breath..."
"The strength of this is impressive, but it isn't particularly enjoyable to drink. More than a bit ""over the top."""
"Good flavor balanced by lack of drink-ability. While I did enjoy this, the 8 bucks and the 2 years of waiting was somewhat of a disappointment. For the same amount of money, Dogfish has some brews that are much more impressive."
"O-My second foray into the Demons of Ale series,after Samaels,was another nice beer.Good balance on an extreme beer."
"O - Overall, I liked this beer, probably alot better than I would the fresh version. Wouldn't mind trying an older one."
"SkÃ…L!"
"Review # 666 poured from a 11.2 ounce bottle into a snifter. My bottle is from 2010, 16.1% alcohol. The pour is murky, and muddy, big white head. The aroma has alot of alcohol, caramel sweetness. The first sip hot alcohol is all you notice, once you get past it the raisins, and honey shine through. The beer is very sweet, and the finish lingers with hot alcohol. The body is medium, good carbonation. I felt this was a nice treat for review 666. I enjoyed it, if they could tone down the alcohol a bit it could be even better."
"PP (Price Point) - $8.99 for a 12oz bottle that is 15.07% I would definitely say this is a must try and a good value for the money!"
"O: Not a bad beer. Avery does the dark fruit flavors well and this beer only pushes that reputation further. I could imagine enjoying this beer with a dessert, but on its own it maybe a little too much flavor and alcohol punch. I continue to respect avery as a solid brewery, and this beer only continues that trend."
"Thick and vicious with boozy burn, but nice balance for such a high alcohol beer."
"Pours a muddy garnet-brown with a thin off-white head that falls quickly, leaving a few spots of lacing, a thin collar, and a nice galaxy swirl. Nose brings forward all sorts of dark fruits plus a strong coat of brown sugar and caramel sweetness. Slight cherry and beautiful oxidation. Flavor is so mellow and smooth. Quite complex and incredibly delicious. Thick, chewy body. My only complaint is that there really isn't much yeast presence here. However, the booze is nearly non-existent and the malt has done wonders. Oxidation has done its duty on this beer. Well done."
"So, if you like extra strong Belgian-style beers, you should give this one a try (at $13, it's not something to get 4 of without having tried it first), but if you aren't so enamored by the style, this is one you may want to pass up."
"This beer is definitely a desert beer. And it is an EXTREMELY well done one. I will DEFINITELY get this again."
"O: Quite boozey and a bit of a sugar-bomb. Vinous with some nice dark fruits hiding beneath. Rather cloying and the 12oz bottle should be shared with a friend."
"O: For me, this beer is just too alcoholic. I believe that it is well crafted for the style of beer that it is. In order to enjoy this beer though, one would have to sip on it the entire evening, and given that fact the flavors are just not interesting enough for me to do this a second time."
"O: I found this beer too sweet for my likiing I don't mind high alcohol as long as it's well hidden and it definitely was not in this case, otherwise it was pretty good, probably won't try this one again"
"O- im not super excited about this one, its pretty darn sweet and its like drinking caramel, super alcoholic to boot, okay to try once but i wont pick this one up again"
"This is really a beer to enjoy in very small portions with good mature cheese to balance the nearly overpowering sweetness and flavors. Vintage 2009, small bottle."
"O: Due to its high alcoholic content, it is definitely a sipper. It a pretty bold drink, but quite enjoyable."
"Overall: A well crafted and interesting version of a Belgian dark ale. Definitely a slow sipper."
"Narrative: ""NOBODY CHARGES ME FOR ADDITIONAL SAUCES, NO BODY."" His neck strained with rage and a sweaty brow.

""YEAH SO THATS WHY THEY CALL IT A JET BOAT, I am sorry, too much for you? Too much speed? Or you just dont know nothing about boats? Don't touch me bro, I am hollering at this girl, OH IM SORRY, SORRY FOR BEING SO EMBARASSING YOU, CAPTAIN NO SEX WITH HAYLEY SINCE 5 MONTHS AGO. ""We should do this more often, check please."""
"The flavors are so prune, fig, and raison packed it's ridiculous. There is alcohol poking through, but this is just a sticky syrupy boozey bottle. i have been sipping on this bottle for 2hrs, and still have half left. it's hard to get though. Not exactly what i was expecting honestly. The strong alcohol flavors are the only thing saving this at all, i enjoy the aroma honestly."
"Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"( 40/50, 14.9% alc/vol, Home, after a good writing performance) Dark, deep red body, shrouded in a veil of thin black sediment suspended in mid-glass. No real carbonation, nor head. To be expected from such a strong brew. First off, I am floored by the alcohol in this baby. 14.9%! But even at that, it does not smell of alcohol. I get roasted walnuts, prunes, figs, dark sweet raisins. Licorice. The mouth is a strong, syruppy mountain of malted sweets and hops resins. Strong prunes, molasses, and has the most wonderful yeast esters of cherry pie and manderines. The mouth is as sticky as it comes without being glue or caramel. It is only at this stage that one can appreciate the alcoholic warmth in the belly. It commands respect. It does feel like an english barleywine as I have ever had one. Belgian, maybe for the yeast strain, it does have those red-fruity esters and residual sugars to prove it. All in all though, this is one nice sipping beer, and although commanding a hefty sale price of 5.53 (on sale for its age) totally worth every pence."
"Anyways, this one poured a dark amber color with a barely noticeable sheen of beige foam on top. Aromas of dark fruits, candi sugar, yeast and booze. On the palate, this one has a somewhat sticky, almost candy like sweetness, along with light brown sugar, caramel and a lot more booze."
"The 2006 bottle allowed for the booze to calm down and the complex malt notes to shine. There was a hint of oxidation to the bottle, but for the most part the super sweet,almost syrup textured beer was very good. Lots of dark candy sugar notes, dark fruit, and even a bite of bitterness on the tail-end."
"O â€“ Superb. I actually opened this brew in the hope that it would satisfy a cheese pairing as part of a craft beer dinner with friends. Having exhausted several theoretical brews as potential matches, I was finding difficulty justifying beer over port. Needless to say, The Beast Grand Cru re-instilled a sense of confidence in the versatility of beer in general, and is, in a word (or 5), the Port of the Beer world. Bravo Avery, Bravo."
"Overall: A very potent brew, even after 5 years. I bet this one fresh would peel the paint off the walls. Guess I should try it fresh..."
"Edit: I'm drinking a 2006 bottle today (5/2/11) and the flavors are all about the fig/date thing as per above. But there's no booziness at all here, just super slick sticky sweet malt. A big ol' syrup bomb without any bitterness or heat. Wild."
"The beast wasn't as beasty as I expected. By that I mean it was well balanced, smooth and not over the top as Avery tends to do sometimes. So I was pretty pleased getting this, the price is ridiculous at the brewery, but it's a damn good beer, maybe buying it in the store is better for the wallet, not sure."
"Overall: This is too intense and unbalanced. Drinkability would be ""2.5", but I like the taste, nose and else so the overall goes up. Eight ounces were fine, and even that small amount hit my head. Would not have any more than that."
"Overall not bad but before I have another one I need to let it age and mellow."
"O - I was very excited about this one because it was a bday treat to myself. I found a distributor that has a whole vintage and rarity shelf. It's incredibly bitter sweet like dark chocolate while having a strong rum flavor almost like drinking a glass of Gosling's while eating a chocolate bunny... Not a bad idea either. Next time i try this one it'll be room temp. Over all it's an excellent sipper and enjoyer. Even now at the end of the review I've still got half the glass left. Can't wait to try the rest of the demon Avery series"
"The Beast pours a crystal clear, vibrant cherry. The off white foam crown is massive, hurdling up to and just past four fingers in height and threatening to spill out of my glass. Retention is very good, and gobs of lacing are left all down the side of the glass. The nose is way off for a big Belgian, it smells much more like a heavy English Barleywine. The nose is heavy on caramel/toffee sweetness, with a pronounced boozy quality. The flavor is just a little bit better. It takes those same notes and adds some fruitiness to the mix. Primarily dates and figs, but there's just a bit of raisin mixed in as well. Still though, no clove or peppery yeast notes, no real intense dark fruits. There's not much of anything here that suggests a dark Belgian ale. Again, the mouthfeel doesn't have a trace of Belgian-ness to it. The body is excessively heavy and the carbonation doesn't come close to cutting through it. In a word, syrupy. The Beast isn't as bad as the final score would indicate, it's just grossly miscategorized. As an English Barleywine I'd say it's just a little bit hot and needs some more time. As a strong Belgian dark ale though it's entirely off base."
"Everything about The Beast was unexpected, from color to flavor to mouthfeel. It's most definitely a heavy sipper, and if this is what four years of mellowing have done to it, I can't imagine what this beer tastes like fresh, and nor would I want to. Nice to try once, but I probably won't look for it again."
"syrupy, medium-full mouthfeel with adequate carbonation. the quintessential sipper."
"2008 bottle. Pours hazy, translucent dark brown with a small, lingering tan head. Smells of boozy dark fruits and raisins and a bit of caramel, similar to a booze bomb english barleywine. Front is caramel, bready, dark fruit goodness with an awesome butteryness. Finishes with a slightly unpleasant hop and booze combo. In addition, this beer right on the border of being too sweet to enjoy. The mouth is creamy and hot with low carbonation. The finish, mouthfeel and booze (even after almost 3 years) makes this beer not particularly drinkable."
"Five ounces is plenty, anymore is overkill. Not very drinkable and too big for it's own good. With that said, there still is some nice Belgian fruity ness coming out, just buried beneath alcohol, that's all."
"D - A sipper, but the booze enhances the beer. I could sip it for hours, making it a delicious and drinkable brew. Certainly can't drink it down quickly, though."
"D- well for what it is I guess it succeeds but as far as being drinkable not so much. Its an alcohol bomb and for those in the hunt for the heat a fresh bottle of this will sure do it for ya. Maybe some more time will finish the mellowing this needs."
"Find it and try it."
"As a sidenote, I'd be kind of interested in trying some of the more attenuated batches of this beer. Batch 4 is 14.6% ABV, the lowest of any batch, and I believe the original gravity was pretty much constant for all batches. Batch 2 was 18.1% ABV, and all the recent batches have been around 16%~ ABV. After sufficient aging, I'd like to try this beer with less residual sugar. I'm not positive, but I think it might fix at least some of its problems."
"It's good, especially if you like sweet beers, but with such high alcohol and heavyness, I can't see trying more than one at a time."
"This is a beer that is not in my rolodex. I like sipping beers, but I don't like sipping beers. This sipping beer is one that I'm not goo-goo ga-ga over. Is it tasty? Yeah. Does it deliver a unique experience? Yeah. Can I recommend it? Only to lovers of strong beer who have large mustaches and smoke out of old time pipes."
"Huge abv detracts from the drinkability. But, this is one strong brew. Not for the lighthearted."
"I didn't know that this was belgian while drinking it and now that I do, I can say that I think the yeast must get lost in the sugary sweetness. I now wish I had gotten more of that aspect of the beer."
"At 16.21 abv, I would be very carefull with this beast. A very sippable brew yet to young to judge accurately, 2010. Would like to stock up and try again in a few years."
"Well this actually retained a surprising amount of CO2 which detracts a bit, as the CO2 admittedly livens the alcohol. But, 7 years has helped the cause, both in carbonation and definitely in alcohol liveliness. I don't know that it'd follow style for the CO2 to deaden out more, but overall it'd help the cause, as this starts to drink suspiciously barleywine like anyways. Honest to God this Beast has become a champ with age. I sincerely wish I had laid another one or two down back in 04. Call me a heretic if you will, but this is quite good."
"D: Delicious beer but too heavy to have more than one. Still worth a try for anyone who is into a finely crafted ale."
"D: For the Grand Cru/Belgian Dark Ale style this is a fair example and definitely worth getting. The entire style though does lend itself to easy drinking. I think of it more as a fine brandy or cognac. You pour it into a goblet or snifter, sit down after dinner, and grab a nice cigar if so inclined. This is almost a dessert beer and with the high ABV, one glass sets pretty well for the evening. If you plan on trying this, save it for last, because otherwise, you've thrown off your pallette for other beers for a while."
"D: also very good, especially for something this sweet and strong"
"I like it as it is now, but additional aging couldn't hurt. I sometimes worry about these extremely high ABV beers, but in two trials with Avery in this department (the other being Samael's Ale), I can be confident the day I open the bottle of Mephistopheles' Ale."
"definitely a new and interesting experience, but I've no intention to try this beer again. Just too damned sweet."
"I don't advocate drain pours and didn't on this one, but it was as close as I've ever come. No doubt. I'll never have this again."
"I'm sorry if my review might seem a little biased.... I very much enjoy Belgian-style strong beers and a good deal of high ABV beers, but this brew doesn't do anything for me but make me want to pass it to someone else."
"I shared a 12 oz bottle with somebody and it still took me a while to finish it, not very drinkable, but decent as a slow sipper."
"D - Obviously, it's a sipper. But, it is very easy to drink with the alcohol being mellowed and infused over the years."
"This is an interesting beer that I will drink on occasion. There is no hiding the alcohol content in this one. The first sip was surprisingly more thick than I thought it would be. It has a lot going on as far as the flavor goes. I can enjoy one and move on to the next."
"ok can you say HARSH .. there is a reason the alcohol content is WAY up on this brew and you taste it IMMEDIATLY !! I did not care for it though i bought 3 of these and still have 2 in the fridge. If you dont mind drinking nyquil chilled then this is for you !"
"It's quite drinkable for what it is, but that's not enough to make me love it. Not a bad idea, but it needs a bit more age on it to make things work."
"Ranges between 14-18% ABV depending on the batch. I've had the 2008 (16.3%) and the 2011 (16.2%). Good, but it loses drinkability due to the high ABV, though for a high ABV it isn't as harsh as you'd imagine. Just not as tasty as say, a DFH World Wide Stout."
"drinkability is not good - best bet is buy one and wait i dont know years before you open one up - pricey and extremely hot - true def. of a sipper beer"
"Alcohol comes first, it's there and it's strong. Taste is quite sweet and malty, lots of raisons and sweet fruit. Mouthfeel is pretty light but sweet without being sticky. Fairly drinkable given the abv."
"Approaching the bottom of the bottle, I suddenly remembered trying this at the brewery on a trip through Colorado back before I was a connoisseur. I didn't like it then - it was too hoppy and hot. Looks like nothing has changed. Several years of aging would likely greatly improve every aspect of the Beast."
"jd"
"A rich, rich caramel reddish color. The head doesn't pour very tall but appears to be very thick. The nose is full of a dough and Fig Newton's. A lot of dried fruit and sweet! The taste is extremely sweet with plums and raisins jumping out on the first sip. The sweetness just kind of hangs out until some alcohol heat finishes this big beer out. The mouth feel is the richest and thickest I have ever tasted in a beer! Difficult to drink with the over abundance of sweet fruit and alcohol. Still it's a fun drink to sip on. It might take a while to drink this one."
"I bought this based on the abv to share with a friend. It definitely did the trick, and while it was a touch disappointing considering the price, it wasn't a bad brew, and I may in fact try it again in the future."
"For its alcohol content, this is ridiculously smooth and dangerous. The four years of age must have definitely eased the alcohol making it way too drinkable at refrigerator temperature and beyond. Luckily there is a bit of bite and the sweetness makes it sippable, though still fantastically soft and velvety."
"Split a bottle into a New Belgium wine glass. Poured deep dark red with very minimal white head. There was no lacing evident throughout. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, fruit, alcohol, and a subtle sour note. The flavor was of sweet malt, sugar, and massive alcohol upon swallowing. It had a medium feel on the palate with zero carbonation. Overall this thing was boozy as a mo-fo... Big malt up-front that tries to mask the alcohol, but ends up being beaten into submission by the alcohol in the end. This one is harsh to get down at first but mellows out slightly upon sitting. Wish the alcohol was masked better, but at this precent, that is kind of hard to do. Worth trying at least once though..."
"I started drinkability out at a 3.5...but I was wrong. It goes down smooth and every sip makes me want more. It's not too dry or sweet on the finish, but it's absolutely a sipping beer. One bottle over the course of a couple hours' reading/writing is a perfect way to cap a night."
"Overall, better than I expected, and extremely well suited to aging. I'll have to pick up a couple more."
"The '10 on tap I've had as well, it is a little less sweet more hop and alc dominant as well."
"D: This beer is surprisingly easy to drink while it's nice and cool. Normally for a beer like this, I like to let it come up to temperature a little bit, but I do not advise that with this particular beer (things get a little rough)."
"Full bodied, proper carbonation, and syrupy. A nice Belgian Strong Dark Ale, but I am glad it is in a 12 ounce bottle. Any more than this would have been too much to handle."
"This is probably my second-favorite of the demon series out of avery. All-in-all this is a tasty beer, but doesn't stand up to some of the other things Avery has done."
"Drinkability - I had about 3/4 of the bottle before I decided to switch to something else. Split it with a friend. It's good, but not chasing-innocent-child-baseball-players-down-alleys good."
"After two years, the beer still has a very syrupy mouthfeel, and combined with the high alcohol content, makes this beer a sipper. I think it could use more time to mellow out, but I don't know if more time will make it less sweet."
"Drinkability is very good. It's very rare that I give a beer above 10% ABV a score above 4 in this section, but this beer is dangerously drinkable with 4 years on it. The flavor is great. Lots of complexity and a smooth body. This is an excellent option for dessert. I will definitely be picking up a few for the cellar and I'd like to see where this beer goes with 5-10 years on it. Nice work Avery."
"I wish I had more of these already aged. They will be great in the cold winter months by the fire."
"O - I'd love to have this with a few years on it to lower the heat. I can imagine it'd be really good in 2012."
"Batch 4 2006. Poured a dark dark red. Nice initial 3 finger tan head which quickly subsided. smells of belgian yeast and burnt sugar. Initial taste, I was suprised by how sweet it was. Alcohol is present. Definately a sipper. Taste of Candied figs, Raisins, dark brown sugar, I like this alot. I'll definately pick up another bottle just to cellar for a few more years."
"Overall I would rate this as a novelty beer, something enjoyed with friends. It has big character and is quite a good discussion beer. It's BIG on alcohol but I quite enjoyed it. Final score, 8 out of 10 based on the WOW factor."
"D - Glad I finally got to add this one to my list, great sipper, enjoy one or share with friends, but definitely give this one a try!"
"I feel like it is probably still very young, and will benefit from several years in my cellar. The heat that comes from the heavy malts and alcohol will smooth over into less of an abrasive port feel, and more of a creamy malt. Avery claims that it can be aged for over 10 years. We'll see if I have the patience for that..."
"D: This beer is definitely a sipper given its alcohol content, but the sweetness does help in masking most of the alcohol from the smell and taste."
"Definitely a sipper, but I mean this brew is great, I like pretty much every aspect of it to be honest. If you haven't had this one before and you like the belgian darks then this one should be moved up a couple notches in your list I think. In my opinion it's better than the belgian imports i've had."
"D= Wow not too sure how to attack this one. A sipper for sure. After a few sips you can feel it hit ya a little. Avery is very accurate with their ABV so I have a good grasp on how this is gonna hit me and it's hard. A one of a kind beer."
"D: While I'm not sure I'd readily go back to this beer, it is surely drinkable."
"Smells of brown sugar and liquor. Some malt/sugar aromas are hidden in the back, but not dominating. Not what I imagined, but definitely good. The first few sips remind me of Lagunitas' Gnarley Wine, but not entirely, but I notice many similarities. Malty, sugary and hints of alcohol are in the flavor. For a beer so strong it does a good job of hiding it's punch. Juicy and medium mouth feel. After this beer as been left to sit a bit, the malt and alcohol start to come out. Hop flavors are present but severely downplayed. Alcohol and hop aftertaste. Now it's starting to taste like sugar. Definitely worth waiting. I still have the other two bottles in the series and they will be opened soon. Even though this comes in a 12oz bottle, you're going to want to split this with someone. Worth drinking once every few years. Great to bring out for tastings. You don't need much of this one."
"D: Oddly enough, it went down easy."
"This is my 50th review and my final in the Avery Demons Series. Overall it is a great collection of high alcohol beers. I did feel that Samael was a big disappointment and will not be buying it again , but I will be buying The Beast and Mephistopheles over and over again as ""cheap"" replacements for DFH 120 and WWS."
"Nearly sweet enough to make your teeth hurt."
"D: I really wouldn't have this beer again unless it was forced on me. Too hot, too boozy, and too much of a mess. Good complexity but what's the point if the alcohol covers it all. So sweet and heavy in the mouth that 4oz. too seemingly an eternity to get down. I appreciate the effort but I won't have this again."
"Drinkability - Avery never seems to disappoint. A very good example of an American version of a Belgian Strong Dark Ale, that's easy to drink. But, I don't really feel the kick in taste that the abv would suggest, which makes this a dangerous beer in terms of repeated drinkability."
"D: Not a half bad brew, but very sweet and not very Belgiany. Drinks more like port. This beer tastes a lot like eating figs, dates and raisins. The mouthfeel is fantastic. High ABV sneaks up on you, but this makes for a mighty fine afternoon sipper. I bet this could be even better if it were aged even longer. Worth the steep price."
"Mouthfeel is good, nice carbonation for a Belgian style, even after all this time. Good drinkability here, the alcohol content is hidden very well, so well that you cannot really detect it, except for the smell. I will surely have to revisit this one a few years down the road, maybe at eight and ten years. I cannot wait to see how the Beast holds up over time. Truly, an excellent brew. A must try if you have the chance."
"D: Certainly a sipper, but as this is smooth and goes down easy, worth finishing the bottle. The alcohol hits you mostly out of nowhere."
"Review must be over 250 characters and less than 5,000. Apparently we shouldn't be snobs, but shouldn't not be snobs, either."
"D - Not at all. One off for the night."
"Certainly a very drinkable beer, but I will note that just as I had Avery's Samaels Ale on tap at the brewery, I believe this beer would show MUCH better on draught! Obviously you can pretty much only have one of these before you feel it, so obviously NOT a session beer!"
"I'm a big fan of this series from Avery."
"D- I was surprised that after 3 years the booze is still fairly aggressive; I wouldn't call it overwhelming, but I expected it would mellow a little more; a couple more years of cellaring for this would be interesting. None-the-less, this is still quite a beer."
"D: This beer reminds me of a Vin Santo, but with less residual sugar. While it doesn't strike me as a bad beer, it's a little out of my normal style preferences and hard for me to really judge the beer. This wouldn't be a regular in my cellar, although it would be interesting to sit on another 2007 vintage for a couple more years to see if the heat backs off a bit."
"Goes down surprisingly smooth, considering how strong it is. Not a bad sipping beer."
"D: it's hard to get around the high booze content, but this beer is a pleasure to drink. It's exceptionally smooth for a brew this big, and it truly leaves you wanting more after each sip. Honestly not difficult at all to drink, unlike some other big beers I've had (Goose Island's Bourbon County Stout comes to mind). Hats off to Avery -- this one's a winner!"
"A red foil wrapped 12 ounce bottle - vintage 2005. Uncapped and poured into a shaker glass. The Beast appears a cloudy chestnut brown color with barely a finger of quickly fading light tan foam. Nose and flavors consist of raisins, prunes, plums, sweet and dark candied cherries, candi sugar - a boat load of it. Decent carbonation after 5 years, with a thick syrup-like body. Very little alcohol heat. The sweetness forces you to sip this one slowly."
"Overall impression - Very rich, thick, intense beer. A definite sipper. Out of the series, I prefer Samael - but will buy this one again."
"The feel is medium to thick, but very smooth and silky. The drink is good, considering this is, ""The Beast""."
"The 2009 release was good but not as great as past releases. This beer pours areddish brown with fine khaki head. On the nose you pick up sweet malt aromas with hints of plums, cherries and honey. The palate has a nice sweetness that helps balance out the heat of the alcohol with fine bubbles from the belgium yeast. Full bodied with flavors of dark cherries and maple syrup. The cherry flavors really linger in the mouth after the finish."
"Bottle at Beer Bistro. 2008 edition at 16% plus. Spicy aroma, pours a dark orange colour with Belgian yeast style head. The taste is sweet and spicy. alcohol warming. Not very complex. European hops, altogether drinkable but not all that interesting."
"Good drinkability for a boozy beast. Complex and delish. One and Done."
"M/D - A dry beer for being so sweet. Not as thick as one may imagine for a 14% beer. Definitely a sipper, but not a pain to drink."
"Over all this was a great drinking experience, however, I doubt I will try it again."
"D â€“ This is a rare treat. But I will order it on-tap anytime I see it. So, very drinkable."
"3.5/4/4/4.5/4"
"A smooth velvety mouthfeel and very sweet but not something you go back for seconds, each sips like taking three of any normal beer."
"M - Mouthcoating, thick, substantial. AAAND WHAMMMY."
"i edited my review twice, as this beer seems to warm VERY POORLY."
"This beer is decent."
"Drinkabiliy: an undrinkable beer. This is a sipper all the way. I did not like this one and couldn't finish it."
"The beer was served from a traditional 12 oz. In my pint glass the beer appeared to be a medium brown with ruby highlights. After one wiff, you will determine...""This is a big-ass beer!"". It had a pleasant malty-sweetness with a butterscotch undertone (probably a contribution of caramel malts and higher alcohol). No hops were present in the aroma. After one sip, you will further determine...""This is a really big-ass beer!"". The flavor was extremely sweet and malty. There was a low hop bitterness present, but nothing could balance out this jem. The alcohol was perceivable in the flavor as well. At times, there was an underlying toffee note like you were biting into a heath bar or something. The body of the beer was full and complex and the finish was sweet and fruity (dark fruit-plums, figs, ect.). Overall, the beer could be summed up like this...a big-ass beer. This is a sipper through and through."
"This is one that I'm not sure if I could drink more than one of in one sitting. Overall, a pretty big beer that was not one dimensional. Really enjoyed the complex malts and honey sweetness that sort of offset the alcohol."
"A very interesting beer, and pretty hard to review. Complex and strong as hell!"
"This is a bottle that should be shared. 12oz is more, more, more than enough for any one person - more on the body than the alcohol though."
"Drinkability: Way strong and it is still showing after 3 years of aging."
"Drinkability: Well, this one pretty much kicked my ass. i can barely type after 22 oz of 18.1% beer. A great sipper that presents powerful flavors without being overwhelming in an y one area. Would I ever get another one? Sure, if I see a 6 year old beer sitting on the shelves, I'll grab one, but I imagine this was kind of a one shot deal. Glad people like sprinkle exist to run beer stores with vintage brews."
"Very little head with a deep orange color. The taste is very flavorful with strong hints of fruits, sugar, and molasses. Full-bodied taste and certainly a sipper. The high alcohol is as expected very warming, but complements the beer nicely. Overall a very complex and interesting brew."
"Notes: Ironically having had the bottle version before, the freshness from the draft serving seems to be a bit compromised by a minor lost of complexity. Decent glassware but not the best here, and a bit of a colder presentation than what would be most beneficial, cuts the brew a bit short. It is still a remarkable brew, and a great finding on tap."
"Poured a dark deep brown with a thin head that disappeared in a matter of minutes. Looks like a huge glass of bourbon. Carbonation is mild but present, perfect for this beer. Smell is of vanilla, caramel, and dark fruits. Maybe a little tobacco and a healthy dose of alcohol. Superb. Tastes much of the smell. Slightly sweet and syrupy but not cloying, tastes of raisins, dark dried fruits, vanilla, caramel, and a bit of funk. Nice alcohol bite but not overpowering - well balanced with the rest of the flavor profile. Feels good on the palate, coating but not overly thick. Drinkability is a bit low just because of how big this beer is but 5 year has mellowed it significatly. If you can get your hands on a bottle, 5 years seems to be the ""sweet spot""."
"This bad boy is a sipper. Probably best shared with a friend."
"Appears a murky brown, much like an iced tea (and a sugary one at that). Little head after an aggressive pour leaving an ivory ring around the edges. Aroma has plenty going on, evoking thoughts of wine and spirits, let alone beer. Certainly boozy, but that's stating the obvious after reading the abv on this one. Smells tangy with caramel, tropical fruits including pineapple, bread, dried fruits, and bubble gum. More caramel and toffee in the flavor along with bitter orange, prunes, and raisins. Has an immediate warming effect, and the syrupy mouthfeel with low carbonation can only be sipped. Not as beastly as anticipated, but this one probably mellowed since being brewed in '05. Fresh, it could have been a different story. Not sure if it's worth the money as I don't think it would leave a lasting impression, but it did make for a relaxing evening."
"Popped a bottle to celebrate the completion of the construction phase of the shelves that have filled my last two weeks. Pours ruby-tinted brown and leaves a razor-thin light tan head that leaves lacing that just won't give up. Smells like port. Very strong alcohol smell. This is scaring me a little. Tastes like caramel, wood, and butterscotch. And scotch. Well, alcohol. Waka waka waka....that's warm going down. Mouthfeel is buttery and a little tingly. And warm. Drinkability is, well...wow, this is boozy. Its a very interesting take on the style. I love that they're not afraid to experiment. Well, played, sirs, well played."
"Tawny orange body with a decent head. Smell is of pineapples and vanilla. Taste is similarly heavy on vanilla and tropical fruits. Also plenty of alcohol burn. This is a decent sipper overall, but it isn't even remotely Belgian in its flavor profile. If you're a fan of rum, though, meet your new favorite beer."
"D. A definite sipper that tastes great on a cool fall evening"
"I Like Avery that much more :)"
"O: Need to get another one and put it to bed to test again in 6 months."
"The Kings Of Hop"
"In late 2009, this 2005 Beast Grand Cru isn't much of a beast. Instead, it's a curiously delicious big beer that is keeping me enthralled all the way to the bottom of the bottle. When sips equals smiles, a purchase price of $7.99 for 12 ounces is well worth it."
"(D)- What a fantastic yet unique beer! Very much not what I was expecting, but I really respect this beer for throwing me off guard like that. The incredible alcohol integration is really impressive. It still hits you really hard about 1/2 way through the bottle. This is a definite sipper that is a good after dinner beverage on its own for dessert, or it might even pair well with a light to medium bodied cigar! I would love to see how this ages after a year or two. This really separates itself in uniqueness from any other strong ale I have had to date!"
"D: A big abv and overly sweet palate may limit this to low moderational sips and servings"
"Ahh...this one goes down smooth, almost like a cognac. I just wished I had saved this for a cold and snowy winter night in front of the fireplace."
"Small dogs should stay on the porch or be eaten, only big dogs run with The Beast. Very nice."
"The body is typical for the style. As for drinkability, well I'm not sure any 16% beer can be overly so, but this one may be. Overall, a good example of the style, certainly worth seeking out."
"Notes: Almost has 120 essense but don't mistake very STRONG ALE!!"
"The name is most definitely not misleading on this one, it is a true beast. Batch 6 (2008) with ABV at a sweet 16.31%. Beautiful sweet smell from all of the sugaring agents and a taste that will blow most others out of the water. Somewhat strong alcohol burn but evened out by the smooth flavor and soft aftertaste. Reddish brown in color and medium to dark haziness. High alcohol content makes this a great candidate for aging. Wish I had a couple cases to get me through the year. Unfortunately I bought this out of town and can't get it here but I can't wait to get another chance to enjoy this beast once again."
"Avery The Beast Grand Cru: Reddish brown colored brew that looks thick and hazy. Had a sugary syrup aroma. Initially creamy full, soft and sugary but immediate as it goes down the warming blanket of alcohol hits. Hot liquor burn coats the throat and stomach right from the get go. Burnt brown sugar in the aftertaste. Medium full body. This is one gnarly Beast and should be locked away for 5 years, at least. Great beer but way to strong for me."
"TOTAL:4.4 (A)"
"Drinkability: I'm not sure how this is going to hold up over the years. The sweetness is just way too insane here. Like a candy drink. Raisin soda that someone poured even more sugar into to try and get it right. Again, would waiting make things better? I'm not sure. I don't think so, though. Give it ten years and see maybe? Again, I don't know. I wouldn't. I wasn't a fan of this, especially when you have brews like Olde School, which I think handle everything a lot better. I hope to try this again, though. Maybe it's the batch. I don't know."
"A definite cold weather beer! Nicely done by the Avery folks."
"Thanks to KAggie97 for that awesome beer. Bottled in 2006. The bottle looks really good. The beer in the glass also, quite dark, almost oily, not much foam. The beer starts strong-alcoholic, quite malty, modest smoky. Warming and intense finish, sweet notes. Very good beer!"
"Drinkability: Although I enjoy this beer way too much the drinkability on this is low, as you only need one for the night."
"Mouthfeel is really creamy. Drinkability is pretty low."
"Drinkability: This thing confuses me. I enjoy it more when its not in my mouth. It might sound like I really hate it, but that's far from true. Its too big for itself, as I assume its supposed to be. This is not a beer you regularly consume, its a novelty. If they wanted to make a normal, big 8-10% belgian dark, they could have, but they wanted a 16% one. Thats going to suffer drinkabilty, but its a fucking 16% Belgian dark. By that criteria, I completely enjoyed it for what it was-- totally worth $8 for a 12 oz. However, compared to other belgian darks, its just not as good because the absurd alcohol content really screws up what would otherwise be top notch taste, smell, and mouthfeel. I'll buy another one and let it sit for a long, long, time."
"Mouthfeel is sugary, doughy, chewy, boozy, and warming. Despite the high abv, it's actually quite delightful and enjoyable. I could see how some would be turned off due to the amount of residual sweetness but I'm perfectly fine with it. To me, it's not cloying. It's just a sipper that's been smoothed out with a countering of hops and age. Lay it down for 3+ years and you'll be glad you did."
"If you like DFH 120 min, this brew might remind you of it, even though they are supposed to be completely different"
"D - Definitely a beer to share. My friends and I tried all three of Avery's ""Demons of Ale"" series and, after drinking one on my own, I HIGHLY recommend. Just gets too powerful towards the end...almost feels like you're drinking scotch"
"This is a great beer to sit and relax with. The full flavor and big mouthfeel make it a sipper. A must try, excellent palate, and all around enjoyable."
"I think this kind of beer is bound to get a slightly different reaction from every single person, so try it out and see what it does for you. I won't be buying a case of it, but if you can get ahold of a bottle, check it out --- it will be an interesting experience."
"drinkability: hey, its not bad...this is certainly not a 6-pack beer. the Beast is to be respected; please fasten your seatbelt snugly before dipping in."
"This was one deceptive beer, I tried it originally with an herbal chicken dinner and cous cous. Cracked it open and WOW the taste was amazing, for about the first half of the beer, after that I could really taste the alchohol and it started to taste a little too strong and had way too much of an alchohol taste to it. Impressed at first but I later became dissapointed. I may have to try it again just to be double sure."
"Drinkability: I shared this 12 oz'er with my buddy. just enough. and at $10/per - plenty"
"While I expected a 14.9 ABV beer to taste like it was a high alcohol beer, I was also looking for a bit more to find during the considerable period I sipped this concoction. Perhaps additional ageing might have been of benefit. It's a beast alright, with ample brute power but not all that refined in the final analysis, the complexity that the ingredients might have conspired to bring to your pallete was compromized by the high alcohol that was squarely in your face for the duration. Approach with caution."
"Drinkability: A dangerous beer to say the least, at 14.9% ABV, this one is a sipper, yes, but I found myself taking big gulps for the hell of it and not actually being taken aside from it. Easily goes down, but the after effects are what this ""beast"" is all about. One of the most flavorful yet easiest drinking Belgian strong's I've tried, unique and to the point. I paid only $2.99 for this bottle and I honestly must say it was the best beer related purchase I made all year. This one holds a place in my fridge anytime! If you can spot this, don't hesitate to let this beast take you on a long ride!"
"Drinkability= Sipper. I'm going slow, real slow. Dude. This thing is a beast. Just fucking me up. Wow. Did I say wow? Overwhelms the senses, but I really dig it."
"Feel and Drinkability: Heavy bodied with low carbonation, perfect for what this beer is. This is one that I'd pick up more of were the price a bit cheaper, at $9.99/12oz its a little steep. This is one that I'm not sure if I could drink more than one of in one sitting, so perhaps its price is about right."
"Overall, a pretty big beer that was not one dimensional. Really enjoyed the complex malts and honey sweetness that sort of offset the alcohol."
"Mouthfeel/drinkability: Very full bodied. It feels thick and creamy in the mouth."
"D. I can say that I am happy that I have tried this beer. The Beast definitely packs a high octane punch. Its a sipper for sure, but one I wouldn't mind sipping on again."
"Overall this is a tasty high ABV beer that's worth a shot."
"D=not really, alcohol is over the top, not very hidden, and sweetness is too much."
"Drinkability - Ouch.. this one stings. Flavorful, but hard to drink, this is a few steps below Mephistopheles in my mind."
"Pours a dark reddish/brown with just a slight haze. A thick frothy 2 finger yellow head crowns the brew. Smells of sweet malts, dark fruits, and a ton of alcohol notes dominate the nose. First sip is all sweet malty goodness, plums, apricots, and warming alcohol that just screams high ABV. The sweetness remains throughout as some bitterness appears in the finish. A creamy mouthfeel that is perfectly carbonated just adds to the experience and for a moment distracts from the beer's in your face boozyness. The lacing covers most of the glass."
"Mouth is obviously viscous and leaves a layer in your mouth that is sickly sweet. Drinkablity is laughable, there is none, its a sipper at best and a thing to force down at worst."
"Mega flavored complex sipper here, alot going on in the flavor. Very much reminds me of port wine. First, the alcohol slaps you around like a dirty pimp, then the nearly ridiculous levels of residual sugars and dark fruits hammer away at the tastebuds. Everything about The Beast is big - flavor, body and smell. All that being said, I enjoyed the experience and might buy another, even at the steep price of $8 for a 12oz. Crazy, crazy beer."
"D: High, surprisingly. This is one tasty beer, worthy of the Grand Cru moniker - at least among the three big Avery beers (Samael, Mephistopheles and this)"
"The carbonation sets off an excellent mouthfeel, which is the approved gateway to the ridiculous drinkability of this brew. Just be careful, once the beast is out its out. Drink safely...at home."
"2005. Murky reddish brown. Looks thick and flat during the pour, but tiny bubbles rise to the surface and form a thin beige ring. Fine spotty lacing, decent retention for what's there. Lots of alcohol in the aroma, some fusels, with plenty of fruit character - pineapple, generic tropical - and caramel sweetness. Lots of fruitiness in the flavour too, tropical and strawberry, with caramel sweetness backing it up. Alcohol was all over the place as well, with mild solvent character. Texture was a little rough, plenty of alcohol warmth, lowish carbonation with a heavy body. Fairly underwhelming, not unpleasant by any means, but it didn't come together for me."
"D: ABV alone enough to keep ut from being very drinkable. I grew tired of the hot alcohol and the way it masked most anything else that may have been in the beer."
"Wow. I was drinking homebrews for most of the night and found a Beast sitting in my fridge. What a great way to end the night! Holy smokes, I was not expecting this. The color is a beautiful amber with a trace of a head. The smell is slightly aromatic. The taste is more than I expected. It has a slightly sour/acidic taste with a strong fruit presence. Mouthfeel is very thick, almost syrup-like. Drinkability is very good, but I don't recommend drinking this after afew rye home brews. The two don't mix. Cheers to ABC for this fine beer."
"D: Like I mentioned before, a sweet syrupy sipper."
"Taste: Very sweet. It actually made my cheeks pucker when I took my first mouthful. Raisins are definitely in the flavor."
"D- If you can handle an extreme beer, this one is a must. Alcohol is high but does not detract from flavor. Drink slowly and carefully. I drank 1/2 a bottle and recapped it because I was getting heartburn and I wanna drink some ""clean"" beer with dinner."
"D-Great drinkability, in moderation :D very complex flavor and a smoothness that hides its high ABV."
"Not a bad drink, but I wouldn't get a sixer of it. Maybe on of those one time things."
"D - You won't fill cooler with this one prior to your next fishing trip, but, as I often say, ""it fits its intended purpose"" (my perception anyways). I'll probably find myself buying it again."
"12/30/07 Bottle Batch 2 from Dilly Delli. Much better balanced beer with a strong sweet flavor with a good burn. This is a now a stand out brew."
"Mouthfeel is medium heavy bodied and creamy smooth."
"Mouthfeel: Sugar-thickness with a very odd soft-drink fizz. Too much like spiked sugar-punch."
"12 oz bottle. Pours a red-gold with a smallish head. Delicious aroma of caramel, bruised pears, dates/raisins, and very mild, earthy hops. Palate is sticky and mouth-coating. This beer pounds your tastebuds with sweetness, giving you all sorts of forbidden fruits to play with. These include apples, pears, figs, plums and dates with a healthy dose of caramel for good measure. Wonderfully complex, it warms as it goes down (2007 vintage listed at 16.42%, but you don't feel it much until afterwards) and leaves you wondering whether beer is the work of some god, or something more sinister. Will enjoy this again soon."
"As a side note, this 12oz bottle was like $8.50, making it one of my pricier beer purchases."
"D - Great beer. I love Grand Cru style beers."
"Served in tulip glass."
"Dark amber pour with a minimal tan head. Port, malt, spun sugar, and dark fruits make up the aroma. Heavy taste. Thick with sugar, yeast, and malts up front that glides into a sherry and finally ends with a hop bitterness. Sticky, lingering mouthfeel and aftertaste. Gets better as it warms. Very good, just wish it was not $8 for a 12 oz bottle."
"12 ounce bottle, bottled in 2005, 14.9% ABV. Served in a chalice, the beer pours a reddish/brown color with a half inch off-white head. The head went away quick, but the lacing is good. The aroma is sweet, fruity and boozy, it smells like raisins, plums, caramel, candy sugar, port and brandy. The taste is the same as the aroma, but the sweetness shows up more and the brandy/port flavor is strong too. Very nice. Mouthfeel/body is full, it's syrupy and chewy. Drinkability is good, considering the ABV. It's a sipping beer, but it's pretty easy to drink. I like this beer a lot, I'll definitely buy this again in the future. And since this one was a 2005 bottle, it ages pretty well. Recommended."
"The aroma of this beer is so complex it's hard to describe. There is definitely a wood characteristic along with caramel, honey, malt, vinegar, fruity, and yeasty. The appearance is reddish brown with a medium foamy head. The flavor is equally complex. There is molasses, fruit, malt, alcohol, and astringent hops. The palate is thick and oily. The aftertaste is medicinal. This beer is like no other I have had. Sadly there is just too much here that is not pleasant to rate it higher."
"Beer was tasty. Very dried fruit pallet. Also the sent of a freshly broken stalk of celery was there. Finished with a maple prune alcohol lingering."
"D- Given the alcohol content, this beer is very drinkable. It's not hot with alcohol, but the alcoholic flavor is a little too dominant."
"D - This is a great tasting beer when it has aged properly. The '05 is far better than an '08."
"This beer kept my belly warm and put my mind in a pleasant place on a cold midwestern evening. I would definately drink this again, although I will plan to drink it next time."
"Overall, I would say it was too much. A great experiment in excess but for strong dark beers I prefer something around 8-9% alcohol. Above that, and the alcohol dominate too much for my taste."
"Great beer for a flavorful taste and aroma."
"Big body and plenty of carbonation enforces the fact that this brew can take on years of proper cellaring. It's nice to sip now, but it's just a bit much of an overload in the malt, balance wise. A BIG kick-ass malt bomb for sure!"
"The bitterness is striking and lends a certain balance to the overall malt bomb at hand. The mouthfeel is great; the drinkability is tough because it's so damn hot. I'll compromise and go with 4. Badass ale."
"Truly a 'beast' of a concoction. Great, intense flavors with a hefty, yet complex alcohol character. An immediate classic for the balancing of flavors alone."
"Well I've tried to and concluded that maybe they are right. Sure there's molasses, and dark fruit and honey, but foremost there is spicy, sugary warmth. Therefore as a Belgian Strong Dark Ale it's alright; but as a warming intoxicating seducer: it is truly a beast."
"Poured a copper to brown color with a decent tan head. Smelled like rubbing alcohol. The first sip almost came across that way too, but it quickly smooths out. You can definitely taste the high ABV throughout but not too bad. I am certain this beer was enjoyed as much as it was because of the cold conditions I was in when I drank it, it is a winter beer for sure. I won't be getting this one again but I'm glad I could say I had it."
"The Beast pours a hazy orange with a yellow/light tan head resting on top. The aroma is sweet malt and medicinal booze. The flavor can best be described as a barleywine on crack. Even after 4 years it is still a boozy hooter of a beer. A little too much for me."
"Now for the scary part the taste. Very,very sweet taste right from the start,too sweet for my taste. Very syrupy,not a boozy as expected,but it's definatly there.Dark fruitness throughout dates,figs,prunes.Has a lighter bodied feel then you would expect,yet it has lots of syrupiness. Already 2 years old don't know if aging more would help out or not. Not my kind of beer,very hard to finish. Not a beer i would want to try again."
"Mouthfeel is thick and chewy. It coats the mouth as it goes down. Mild carbonation prickle and a moderate alcohol burn. For a higher ABV, the alcohol is kept in check nicely. A very slow sipper indeed."
"D: A big abv and overly sweet palate may limit this to low moderational sips and servings but otherwise is quite drinkable if respected."
"O-At 3 years, this is worth trying again. Doesn't measure up to Mephistopheles or Samaels, but worth trying. Will check it out again when it hits 5 years. I have a sneaking suspicion it will still be boozy as all hell."
"The beer is crystal clear (like all Avery beers I've tried except Mephistopholes), tan copper color, extremely thin wispy head (my guess = too much alcohol). The smell is similar to Gulden Draak mixed with tomato juice, that's just what comes to mind. It's a barley wine in my opinion, very malty and sweet. In fact the taste is syrupy sweet, intensely alcoholic, almost like cough syrup. Thick body, the alcohol burn lasts a long time. I guess this will be appreciated by many drinkers, but not by me. This is a hot sweet barley wine, hard for me to drink."
"this is probably not a good starter beer by any means. i would only toss the beast to a well seasoned vet."
"The mouthfeel is fairly silky for having such high alcohol level. This beer is made for sipping. I really like how complex this beer is, the finish leaves a clove and menthol taste on your tongue for quite some time. Warning this brew is not for the weak hearted. Once again Avery shows why their the best brewery in Colorado."
"D: See above. It's way too high an abv beer to drink regularly. This 12oz bottle is almost too. But a very delicious beer."
"This is a very nice beer. I am enjoying this as much as the Samael. A unique interpretation of the style, and recommended to the experimental beer lovers. I always enjoy this during the cooler months."
"I'm afraid that this is too much in so many ways. If I let myself drift into the thought of having a smoking jacket, a wingback chair and an English Setter by my slippered feet, then every sip is grand. Alas, I have none of those except for a weathered (and quite pedestrian) set of slippers."
"More big and evil goodness from Avery, the Kings of the beer underworld. Or something like that. High expectations for this one. Let's see what we got. Poured reddish amber into a snifter. Very slight head with quick dissipation in the retention department. Interesting aroma bringing forth raisins and candy. Tastes of slight hops. Syrupy and sticky like you've been sucking on some candy for awhile. There's a lasting alcohol burn which is not surprising considering the alcohol content, but the drinkability is not that bad considering the 16.42% ABV. While brews of this magnitude and gravity are not going to be a staple of a brew lovers diet, they are fun and interesting for something different and keep things moving forward in regards to experimentation. This is one of the most wicked labels I've ever seen."
"Poured out of the bottle a garnet color with an enormous cream colored head. Good retention of the sticky cap and it became rocky after a while. Aromas are very sweet, candy sugar, alcohol esters and caramel malts. The liquid is just as potent and much like drinking syrup. Overripe fruit, raisins and alcohol. Unfortunately, it's just too much. Genuinely cloying. Would be better with years of age and only with years. Good mouthfeel but just not drinkable."
"D- I think its worth the $8.49 and that such complex beers are very hard to find these days. When i get a couple other bottles of beast, they will be aged and appreciated heartily."
"D- This is a sipper by all means. I struggle at somep oints just because of the alcohol potency. One of these and you are done for. Two your in a stew, three you cant see and four your on the floor."
"Poured into a snifter, it had nice light tan head about a finger and a half thick, bubbly and had some good lacing. The body is a beautiful deep amber color, a bit hazy and filled with carbonation. Its aroma is filled with lots of dark fruits, raisins, prunes, some mild citrus smells (grapefruit) and has some hints of alcohol and a semi dry bite to it. The taste is very smooth, a bit spicy on the edges and finishes dry; it's mildly sweet over all, and filled with dark fruit flavors. It definitely has a full body and leaves your mouth nice and warm and refreshing when you inhale. This is a good beer , but there are plenty of better Belgian strong dark ales out there."
"D: For as high as the alcohol content highly drinkable. I would be curious what this tastes like after aging."
"Two years aged, this poured a very hazy mahogany with tan head. Its smell was powerful, like sugary caramel malt and honey wheat, with citrus hops and alcohol. It tasted so sickeningly sweet it hurt my teeth. It had flavors of raw sugar, honey, caramel, raisin, and molasses all mixed together, with noticeable alcohol. I couldn't even tell if there were hops present, because the sweetness was so dominant. It was syrupy thick with no carbonation, and had the sweetest aftertaste ever (to a nauseating degree). Overall this beer was simply undrinkable. It was worse even than the 120 minute. The worst part is that it had a lot of potential, and could have been great like the Thomas Hardy's Ale if Avery used any moderation in its brewing at all."
"This beer is good new but just gets better as it ages.... The 2005 seemed to have the best balance, the 2004 was very malty and I prefer a bit more hop flavors.. Overall you can't go wrong with any of these."
"The beer really has some depth to it. The alcohol gets smoothed out half way through the trip. It seems to mellow quite a bit once it warms. It was very enjoyable journey. I think Avery does a wicked solid job. It reminded me of a dessert wine."
"With the earthy fruit and the mack-daddy sugar content, about the only thing keeping this from tasting like sloe gin is the teaser of malt. I just can't use the word sweet enough. And the hot and heavy ABV is no friend, almost daring you to have the guts to take another sip. I'll take the dare, but when this is gone, I'm done."
"What a warm, inhalation of relaxation. This is a fireplace beer. Maybe in front of a campfire, when you can just zone out on the flames for awhile. Stretch out and let it consume you. This beer is a bit harsh, yet mind mellow."
"D - You need to take your time with this beer its a good beer that you have to enjoy slowly worth trying sometime"
"Edit - An hour+ later, the remaining 3/4 of the bottle got the drain treatment. I just couldn't stomach it. Unfortunate, and a waste of 5 bucks I could've spent on something I would've enjoy. C'est la vie."
"D: Nope, can't do this one. Kinda what I was expecting. This is just all sweetness. This makes a barleywine look like an amber ale. If you're into malt bombs, I suppose this is worth a try, but I need a little more balance than this. I couldn't finish it...I couldn't even begin to drink it. I took a few sips but the sweetness is just too much. Ah well...an expensive experiment."
"Too much alcohol. If ageing will cut the heat down then this should of stayed on the shelf for 5 more years."
"I rate the drinkability high simply because while this is a sipper, it's not so punch-in-the-face strong that one cannot have a few gulps. More importantly, it's a beer well worth savoring, really the main and more positive consideration instead of the very high ABV (14.9%). It's strong, and it certainly catches up, but it isn't painfully strong. Very delicious, and one I'll gladly have again. Excellent."
"M/D: A little slick, carbonation is slightly high, alcohol isn't felt on the tongue but on the way down. A sipper for sure. This one could catch up quick and the sweetness slightly takes away from the drinkability."
"D: A huge beer, massive flavors and an intensely alcoholic experience. This is definitely one you have just one of and one I struggled to finish 12 oz. of. One to sip on and while away the time, but not really as captivating as I'd hoped for. Worth the experience and one I'm glad to have tried, but perhaps not one I'd need to have again."
"Bottle picked up form City Wide in South Bend. Its always been something they have in stock, but ive never gone for it. Poured red to crimson and very dark. nice quick, short head. big ol' rangy legs. Little floatie flecks. vinous rummy odor...dates, prunes, ethanol. taste is ... whoa...a taste explosion. dates, raisins, sweet toffee and malt. notes of chocolate. sweetness works well with the huge alcohol presence. hot, but also smooth. roasted malt and alcohol on the finish. leaves the impression of a tasty, well aged old ale. velvety and full bodied. my second of these massive avery brews, and ive been blown away by both. time to go for that big stout of theirs."
"Drinkability: This is another one of those once in a great while brews because of the price, ABV%, and the overall sweetness of the beer. For me, I wouldn't mind another one of these after it's been aged for another year or two."
"Not an everyday beer, but definitely worth trying."
"This bad boy was bottled in 06 and could still take paint off of the w wall."
"It isn't bad, but I thought the oak balanced out Samael, whereas this beer is just sweet and boozy. Not bad, there is a good deal of complexity to it, but I can't say it is my bag."
"Not a huge fan of Avery's big beers and this was no exception, too strong for my palate and would never be able to finish a bottle of this by myself, have heard some people say they really enjoyed it, the four of us did not so much last night, would not drink again, might be worth trying maybe once"
"Smell is rich, malty, with maple & oak notes as well as caramel, dark fruits and smoke. Taste is all of the same, like drinking a rum-soaked fruitcake. Smooth, rich and creamy, a very good beer with great complexity and good balance."
"Pours a beautiful deep mahogany color with a bright head that settle fairly slowly. Aroma is a very malty, somewhat woodsy, with just faint hints of the alcohol to come. Taste is very sweet, hints of cane sugar, apricots, oak, and surprisingly, the alcohol is very well hidden behind the sweetness. Mouthfeel is very smooth and sticky, almost syrupy. A beer that seems to get stronger as it goes along. Great flavor. I'd love to try this again in the future, but it'd be hard to drink more than one in a sitting."
"As can be expected from something with that many different brewing sugars (turbinado, raisin, dates, molasses, honey, and dark Belgian candi), there is a pervading sweetness that certainly isn't for everyone. I'm intrigued to cellear this one for the recommended 10 years and see how it matures/mellows. If I can convince myself to get past the sticker shock again."
"DRINK ON!"
"Drinkability is dangerously good for size of this 'beast' , the ABV is really well hidden, save for the tingle on the tongue. Obviously one for the cellar, pushing two years old right now, I'd say this bottle is still on the young side. This is the first bottle I've aged, but it will not be the last. The Beast is on my short list of beers that I'd like to try to age 20+ years."
"This is almost to candylike to drink. I have some more in the cellar, I hope it mellows out. If it wasn't $6 a bottle I would pour it down the drain."
"This is a big big beer, and gets kind of brutal after a while. Almost becomes a bit of a chore to drink."
"It's a little boozy, but sweet overall. The body is very heavy, but there is still a little carbonation. This is a sipper if I've ever had one. Delicious beer, but I don't think I'd have another one by myself. This is the sort of thing I'd like to share with a couple people."
"Drinkability is good for a beer of this size. I had a 12 oz bottle. Couldn't imagine drinking a bomber of this by myself!!! I would definitely have another at some other date though."
"Once again, Avery proved to me they really know what they are doing. Although not my favorite tasting brew, this one is a hell of an experience. I'm very glad I picked this one up. I'll have to try it again and hopefully get one that hasn't lost its carbonation."
"Not an easy drinker by any means, but then it's not supposed to be a lawnmower beer, is it?"
"The beer pours a dark amber/brown color with a 1/2"" offwhite head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is great! It has a kick ass burnt toffee and warm alcohol scent. It's sweet with some roasted malt aroma. You can really smell the raisins and molasses; not much yeast in yeast fruitiness, although the presence is noticeable. The taste is great also. This beer is so smooth and flavorful. It's sweet and sugary on the lips. It goes down slow and warm with a slight raisiny finish; very nice. The mouthfeel is awesome. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a truely great beer. I let it warm up before drinking. I'm glad I did. The complexity is off the charts."
"After that first sip It became interesting until about halfway through the bottle, after that I began to wonder how I would ever finish. It was a battle that was won with great effort and eventually, drunkenness."
"Avery The Beast pours a dense, opaque, dark, amber peach. This appearance lightens over a period of around thirty seven minutes. The smell is thick of malts with a slight fruit back. The taste is strong of apricot, and malt beer. Mouthfeel is dense, and slightly to medium carbonated. Half glass: this has thinned, but if you consider the ABV, carbonation is medium to high. The finish of this Beast is fantastic, very similar to Harvest Ale. Overall, I would say this is what one needs to finish off a good night of beer drinking with a plaster. Goodnight."
"Drinkability is ok. But the alcohol is way too much. I've had other very strong beers that hid the high ABV well, this didn't. Still, it's a very tasty and interesting beer that is worth trying. If I decide to buy another bottle, it's going to sit in the cellar for a year or more..."
"Batch 5 (2007) 16.42% ABV. Wow, and now for something completely different. . . Aroma is complex. Caramel, resin, raisin, apple, banana, honey, dates and figs, as well as alcohol. Pours with a small off-white/to almost yellow head. Excellent Lacing. Body is clear and an amber red/brown. Really shocking taste. An explosion of flavor accompanied by an explosion of alcohol, it may be a bit too sweet. Starts off quite sweet and goes a bit acetic. Body is creamy smooth offset by lively carbonation and a strongly alcoholic and mildly astringent (not really in a bad way) finish. If you like your hard liquors then the palate is awsome but very much unlike any other beer that I have found so far."
"sweet looking bottle, the more cool bottles i have bought, the more i wish i would keep them, but thats another story. poors with absolutely no head, just a few bubbles from a tiny bit of carbonation, its like a dark cloudy opaque brown syrupy miracle of beer, the smell is fantastic, just wonderful sweet apples scents with a strong yeast and alcohol smell, which leads me to the taste, holy crap this is STRONG beer, its almost too strong, its like a thick alcohol beer syrup, each sip brings different flavors, from citrus, to malt flavors, the only reason it isn't an exceptional is because of the alcohol its just a bit too much for me. just way too much. if you can handle it, good luck"
"This one has a big body and then some. A huge profile leaving a creamy finish. Overall this is a fantastic beer that is best aged. Fantastic"
"Not a bad beer considering a hell of a lot of candy sugar was added to boost the alcohol. Not as spiced as a lot of other belgians and I like that. Definetly would only have 2 of these maz before I passed out, but very easy to drink surprisingly."
"Taste is sweet with hints of dark fruits. Is a tad bitter, but pleasant. Definitely a sipper to be enjoyed with a meal. Mouth feel is very filling with nice hints of sweetness on the finish. Bubbles do not attack the tongue - that is left to the full body of this brew. All in all, a nice one."
"D = A very drinkable beer but in moderation, the taste is strong and it packs a wallop."
"Yesterday, I sampled Avery's other big brew - Samael's, and the overbearing and overwhelming taste were too noticeable for me to actually enjoy a beer that I spent almost $10 for a typical 12oz bottle... much was the same with this one... an almost identical beer in appearance, taste, and aroma... Dark, ruby-red, grainy appearance with nice frothy head... Smell is very thick and powerful, with a caramel and malt aroma where the 14.9% ABV is very apparent... As with Samael's, the flavor was once again too thick, way too sweet, and too overwhelming to really be enjoyable... you can certainly split this 12 oz with one or two other people... a real sipper that you should try to enjoy over a space of at least an hour... Taste was ultra-rich and way too sweet... the alcohol flavor was surely noticeable, and the overall mouthfeel and drinkability suffered... I would consider the drinkability similar to drinking a batch of sugar bathed in gasoline oil... Not something I enjoyed, and for the ridiculous price, I would never purchase this one again..."
"Overall: Delicious, warming, very drinkable, and amazingly well balanced for such a huge beer. It feels better balanced than the first time I had it in 2005, despite this batch apparently having reached a higher ABV. Delicious stuff -- I'll buy it again even with a single bottle costing close to many micro/craft six packs."
"D - It's a sipper. I think it's too warm though and the alcohol stands out too much. It would benefit from a spell in the cellar I expect."
"A very unique and enjoyable beer. However, I feel that some of the complexities are overpowered by the alcohol. Still very hot after 3 years of aging. Best enjoyed at cellar temp in 4oz servings"
"Bottled in 2005. Pours a dark and cloudy amber with almost no head whatsoever. The smell is very rich and sweet with dark fruits and some rather apparent alcohol. The flavor is overly sweet with candied sugars, but very complex with raisins and molasses flavors. The alcohol is somewhat subdued (i dont want t know what it was like 2 years ago) and some belgian spices round out the complex flavors. The mouthfeel is very syrupy and the extreme sweetness makes this a sipper. I would rather have someone to split this one with, an interesting brew, but finishing even 12oz is going to be tough"
"I think that the thick flavor is necessary to hide that nasty alcohol flavor that too many brewers leave in high ABV brews. This is a beer drinkers beer and not for the faint hearted, though we all know it would probably be best after it is allowed to mature."
"Overall, I was disappointed with this offering. This is really the one beer from Avery that I do not particularly care for."
"Thanks to Wasatch for the recommendation."
"Overall I really did not know what to expect ofut of this but was pleasantly suprised. The alcohol was there but it was understated for the volume and I had ni issue finishing this despite being so strong. I would pick up another if I saw it."
"this is a very cool brew. 2007 vintage, at 16.5%. Pours a transparent dark glowing amber. Nice head that is retained unusually well for high abv's brewed in america. The nose is of date, raisin, and sugar, with only a slight bit of alcohol. At first taste it is the dark fruits that make themselves known. The sugary taste comes in after that. The alcohol rears its ugly head just for a moment in the finish and the aftertaste brings out the six kinds of hops in this Grand Cru. A good shot by avery, much better than the samaels. The texture is nice and chewy and the sugar sticks on your lips. The dark fruits are intense, as is the candi sugar. The alcohol and hops are not overwhelming at all but do show up in the finish. suprisingly smooth for the abv, and worth a try. Im sure this beer will cellar quite well over the course of many years."
"Picked up at Brawley's in early 2006 during my trip to Charlotte, this 2005 batch of beast at 14.9% was a little too strong to pass the Georgia ABV cap. I chose an EKU goblet to pour it into, and there it sat deep red, with a small head. The smell was honey, orange marmalade, and fruit punch, but amazingly not boozy at all. The taste was very sweet indeed, as if someone had blended a jar of apple and grape jelly with beer. Molasses and maple syrup appeared in the taste well. There was a hint of spice and a touch of citrus, but sweetness was far too strong to call them any kind of a counterbalance. No hops anywhere. Very warming in the finish as anticipated. Sticky in the mouth, but the aftertaste was a simple fading sweetness. Worth a try if you are a fan of big beers, and don't mind a malt bomb."
"I'm well buzzed after a bottle of this. I recall some friends breaking this one out several years ago at a beer tasting in the 22oz form, and being taken aback by the heat. I believe it was a measly 14% at the time. This time's no different. Not exactly tough to drink, but hard to get through the sweetness. Very slow sips through the evening will get you through."
"Personal score- 76/100"
"a great sipper for this winter"
"D: It's 18%. I mean how much can you take? It's good, but man, a bomber is a lot for 1 night. Recommended."
"D: The alcohol content doesn't hurt the drinkability as much as I thought it would, though this beer definitely is a sipper. A complex, big beer, very interesting, on par with the infamous Dogfish Head 120."
"Please note that if other reviews are correct, and I am assuming they are, this is not the same ""beast""; the different ABV and bottle size hint to a step down in alcohol that contributes to its drinkability. It is still quite heavy, a ""sipper", and a good ""winter warmer""."
"Is this really a summer release?! Can't be. This is a winter warmer if you ever wanted a warmer winter. Sheeminy... Great ruby to amber color & champagne bubbles. Head is decent, retention, ehh... Smell is sweet, candylike, and burning with alcohol. This beer warms very well... I didn't care much for it at first, but it's growing on me. Doesn't taste much like a Belgian Strong Dark to me, at all, actually. More of a barley wine. Too hoppy, and at a complete loss for the fruity esters expected from a BSD. Nice, but won't go out of my way to track down again..."
"I want to say that my bottle was just an oddity but at $7 a bottle, I guess I won't know for a long time."
"I didn't see any yeast at the bottom of the bottle so I really don't know how this beer would age, but if there is in fact still live yeast in this beer, I wouldn't mind laying one down for a couple of years to see what happens. But for now, its a bit too strong to drink any more than half a bottle or so at a time."
"Recommended."
"Overall I think this is a good beer. I enjoy the fact that the alcohol can be disguised with the great characteristics of this beer. I do think in fact it may have put my reviewing to a stand still as I'm not sure I will be able to accurately review any future beers ;). A-"
"I also just opened a bottle (couldnÂ’t wait to age it) of the 2007 and actually find it even better than last years. This is a bit higher in abv at 16.42%."
"Poured into a Duvel tulip. A 1 finger head that holds fairly well for a 16.4 % beer. A deep deep golden/amber color with a creamy tan yellowish head. Smell is pretty darn sweet of candy sugar. The pungent sweetness. Its a bit bitter on the taste but silky smooth syrupy mouthfeel. The taste is sweet, apricots, biscuit and finishes bitter and slightly dry given the sweetness. I love it, but I'm partial to monster beers. I'm not sure I'd give it great marks against the BJCP style guidelines for a Belgian Strong Dark Ale, but its a hell of a lot of fun to drink. The name of the beer is all too fitting. Good stuff."
"Poured into a pint glass. This beer was a 2007 vintage, poured into a pint glass. The smell was very hoppish. and the Color was a brown, with a tint of red, and a white head that went away quickly with no laceing. The taste of the beer was strong, but more hop strong and a little bit ot malt aftertaste. It's a ver complex beer. Hard to really review it. Overall, i could probably drink one of these agian."
"Batch number three. Poured a reddish brown color that was lighter in color than I had anticipated. Aroma was sweet and dominated by the smell of dark fruit (rasins, dates?). Taste is of dark fruit, caramel, and molasses. Strong, so this must be drank slow. Very good, but not outstanding, to me"
"It has a full body and the carbonation is lightly done and the finish has a slight bitterness to it that lingers for a while. Nice. I'm going to save my other bottle(also 2007) for next year and see what happens but in the mean time, while I'm in Colorado for the GABF Saturday, I'm going to buy some more. I'm pretty darned impressed."
"Pours a slightly muddy reddish brown. Thin head. Smells of soy sauce, figs, candi sugar, and spice. The taste is sweet and strong. Sweet sherry, cherries, hot alcohol, candi sugar, and spicy fruit, plums and apple especially. Especially spicy finish. Warming and tasty. Mouthfeel is unctuous- just what its aiming for. Drinkability is actually pretty good for such a high abv, This is obviously a postpriandal sipper."
"Drinkability: A bit to sweet for my taste and at the alcohol % I wouldn't want more than 1 in a night. Still pretty good"
"05 vintage. Pours dark copper to amber in color, mainly clear with a bit of sediment, a small cream to tan head fades quickly. Aroma is big on sugary sweetness and booziness. There is also a bit of apples, cinnamon and breadiness. Taste follows with a huge sugary sweetness, nice breadiness, ripe sweet fruits like prunes, raisins, and figs and a large boozy bite and warmth at the finish. Much like a dessert wine, very strong and sweet. Mouthfeel is thick and a little sticky but nicely cut by the alcohol bite and warmth. I enjoy this beer, nice as a nightcap. Definitely not one that you will drink a lot of and also would be hard to follow this with something else, but nice to finish with. Sugary and booziness makes it not fit the category but call this a barleywine (its not totally unlike samaels) and it would 'fit' better."
"My drinkability level for this beer might be a bit harsh. A 12 oz. bottle of this can be enjoyed amongst three drinkers. That being said I ended up drinking 2/3's of this no problem since my friend did not enjoy the taste. Far from a session beer, but a beer I will return to if I find a good deal or if it's aged some more."
"Tremendous. Incredibly delicious and insanely drinkable for a 14% beer. But be warned: this is a total dessert beer, rich enough that pairing it with another dessert is pretty much unthinkable."
"D- A bit too sweet and cloying to enjoy on a regular basis, but still well worth a try, I recommend it for the experience."
"Drinkability - this is an excellent ale. This is more of a sipper than a session beer, due to its rich taste and also very high abv."
"Poured into a chalice a beautiful dark amber/mahongy color, very nice carbonation, awesome two-finger plus creamy tan head, tons of creamy sticky lacing throughout the drink. The nose is malty, lots of dark fruit (plums, raisins, fig's), some spices, slight oak, vanilla, and a good dose of caramel. The taste is absolutly delicious, malty/oak, sweet, good presence of dark fruits, and caramel. The alcohol has it's presence at the beginning, but fades nicely, the sweetness is left and warming of the throat. Medium body, a well rounded/complex brew. Very drinkable, absolutly a fabulous brew, way to go Avery. Highly recommended."
"Now I like extreme brews, and Avery does a great at pushing the envelope, but for me this was a miss. I let this one age hoping to tone it down, but no luck. Poured a thick light amber, and the alcoholic aromas were out- hard unrefined sugars, spicy and burning on the nostrils. Mouthfeel was thick and syrupy with a lasting burn I have not felt before from even stronger beers. Taste was overly sweet with hints of woody resin and a nasty medicinal character- definately needs refinement."
"D - Less than average because of the HUGE differentiation between the hops / malt balance. One of athese was more than enough for me, especially at 14% alcohol."
"."
"Cheers!"
"D- no matter what, for its strength its amazing, however this is a little too sweet for me. this was a highly enjoyed beer, but i dont think ill be looking for another for awhile"
"woah... this is what i call a nightcap for sure... poured a dark, almost blood red. little, off white head that went away pretty quickly and left a little clumpy lace. smells of raisins, figs, port, dried fruit, sweet bread yeast and just a little booze. very syrupy taste that pretty much mimmicks the smell. the alcohol is balanced out pretty well. i expected a much more boozy finish. like i said, very syrupy on the palate, but for such a strong beverage, it goes down quite smoothly. very drinkable, but absolutely not sessionable. a great dessert beer or just a fine choice when you decide the night is over. this will put you to bed."
"An interesting and pretty good beer from Avery. I believe this is the strongest beer I've had (at least until I crack the Avery M. Stout) but the sweetness overcomes the alcohol bite. A definite malt bomb which would be nice for a cold winter's evening."
"Well...close anyway and perfect for tonight."
"well, friends, what a beautiful beer to look at. This poured a dark, dark reddish amber, and it is absolutely gorgeous. I am reminded of that red-headed asian I once datedÂ… The head sticks around, minimally, at the edges of the glass. Upon drinking the taste is very, very good, though somewhat too sweet. There are dried figs and raisins in here and I am loving that. There is also alcohol, and at nearly fifteen percent, I am surprised it is not overwhelming. I feel it a bit, pleasantly, by the end of the beer, but I do not taste it. This is one great beer of the truly alcohol-heavy beers, though it is missing that hoppy bitter kick that I love. Enjoy this one, friends, just enjoy it at home or with a friend driving you home."
"D- feels like overkill, too sweet for me, a sipper, bottle best shared between a couple people, not much of a beer, kind of leans toward soemthing else"
"Avery put a lot of work into this beer, it's evident. It's a huge beer that nearly entirely masks the immense ABV, which in itself is an accomplishment. The fact that it does this while maintaining a complex and not overwhelming flavor balance is incredible. This is a world-class sipping brew."
"Drikability? I'm sure there are people out there who love this but for me it's a struggle. It's so sweet and sugary and with a big alcohol kick that it seems strong just for the sake of being strong. (I'm sure they're proud of the 15+ percent.) But it ends up being a big alcoholic mess."
"A definite sipping brew, can't see consuming a lot of these. Worth a try, perhaps the one beer to have when you're only having one."
"In the land of big beers I've had stronger and weaker. This one has many of the complex qualities I enjoy in a stronger beer without loosing sight of staying in the realm of drinkable. If I had this in my market I'd put 6-12 in the cellar and enjoy over 10-20 years."
"Yeowzers! This is from a 2005 (I think I can safely clain that this is a:) vintage. 14.9% Intense red/brown color. Ho hum head with minimal lace. The aroma is BIG with very ripe dark fruits like plums, dates, figs, sesame; lot's going on. Flavor is the same but intensified. Shazam! A sipping beer, no question. Long finish, mainly sweet accented with a bit of bitterness and a hint of sour. Great beer."
"D- Good dessert/night cap beer but I could never have more than one."
"How do you score drinkability with these? Overall it's well done, but no Belgian strong is ever a quaffer."
"Drinkability - I have another of these cellared but I don't think I will be revisiting it for some time. The alcohol warms you as you drink and is masked pretty well, but it is a little too syrupy for my tastes."
"Beer is good. Happy BIG BIG beering."
"Pours a four finger light brown head that fades slowly leaving a good lace. Cloudy amber color. Light carbonation and very heavy bodied. Sweet molasses nose. Sweet molasses flavor dominates, the high ABV is noticeable and warming. 12oz bottle a gift from Vintage Cellars Blacksburg, VA. Label has the ABV at 14.7%."
"Cloudy, medium-dark brown, carbonation sticking to the sides of the glass. No head, surprise surprise. This smells a lot like de dolle beer IMO. Rich, bold, strong, rum soaked raisins, dark chocolate, bread, yeast, butterscotch. The taste is interesting. Definitely way too much alcohol to be covered up. The underlying flavor is extremely complex, though. Nutty, sweet, almost an oatmeal like malty taste. The alcohol creates a spike of sweetness around it leaving an almost sour buffer around the alcohol. The finish is super-sweet with a touch of that bready nuttiness again. Lots going on, but still too much alcohol for its own good."
"Honestly, I think I bought this because of the huge ABV. Maybe this is for someone, but not me."
"Keep doing what you're doing Avery... I love it!"
"Mahogany body topped by a very long lasting sand colored head. The head is reinforced by a multitude of tiny carbonation streams. The beer almost sparkles, like a metallic red paint. Aromas are dominated by alcoholic bourbon notes. This stuff s about 1/3 the strength of bourbon, so not a huge surprise I guess. Also some nice dark plum scents. I take a sip and then 'WOW!' man does this stuff have an alcohol burn....sugary sweet as well. I think they forgot the hops on this batch. Is punishing, but I canÂ’t stop sipping it. Definitely a night-cap or dessert type beer. I also think it could use a couple years to mellow a bit. Mouthfeel is thick, but still has enough carbonation to lift the layer of sugar off the tongue. Drinkability - well, not a beer to power through, but still interesting enough to stick with it. Wish I had several more to stash away. Think it will only get better."
"rummy-sweet dark fruits dominate the flavor. bordering on cloying, but balanced with a gentle carbonation and a slightly bitter hop presence in the finish. alcohol peeks through slightly, but not as much as you'd think given the 15%. warming, complex, and drinkable until the alcohol wears you down. a seriously well-crafted high gravity beer."
"This beer could benefit from at least 5 years of aging. Fresh, it is too sweet and way too hot. Although, even in 5 years, this could still be too sweet. At least the alcohol would retreat some. This beer will knock you out. I don't know if I would recommend this - but it is interesting."
"I wonder what aging would do. Hopefully it would make the alcohol quality less intense, but would that simply bring the sweetness to the forefront? I may have to find out..."
"I feel bad that I'm not giving this beer a better rating, but it was simply a case of ""too much of a good thing."" Dark brown with no head - had to look closely to make sure it was carbonated. Sweet, with a first impression of maple syrup that deepened into molasses, brown sugar, raisin and prune. That is a lot to pack in there. The abv was not too harsh, but no question about the alcohol being there. Finished a sweet as the start, with some hops bitterness struggling to reach through. As good as all this sounds, it was just too dense and powerful to enjoy for more than a few sips."
"D - Not that bad. It is waaaay too strong. It is always strange when you are hammered after one 12 oz beer. It is is tasty and goes down pretty easily though. I would say this is an old ale over a Belgian strong though. I will probably try this yearly from now on. Note: I cellared this one for about six months before consumption."
"poured from a 12 oz, into a Small tulip glass. Got moderate head over a dark amber body. Smells very sweet, a little spicy, and of grainy malt. Tastes sweet. Very sweet. A little of that grainy malt, and maybe they hid some hops in there. Did I mention it's really sweet? 'Cause it's really sweet. Oh the alcohol comes through after some of your sweet taste buds have died off. It's really heavy on the tongue - not like you'd expect from a Stout, but syrupy Sweet. It has a huge sweet finish cut short by a bite of alcohol , then lingering sweetness. This is really good stuff, but too thick, sweet, and strong to have more than one."
"Only a 12 ounce bottle, IÂ’d luv to have more of these down the road. And I will, as I look forward to the next release"
"This beer is light bodied, but the sugar content renders it quite syrupy. With the alcohol burn and syrupy body, this one ain't all that drinkable. Overall it's not awful for a Grand Cru, but lacks the complexity and bouyant nature of say, the Rodenbach Grand Cru. It's not the best Avery has to offer."
"Compared to other beers of the same style, this one has a softer looking head, and a higher sweetness in both the smell and taste. Somehow, the alcohol blends in rather than taking over the palate. The feel is also thicker than others. Compared to Samael's Oak Aged Ale, this one is much easier to drink, as you can take large sips rather than small ones, and the alcohol doesn't dominate. The small bottle size allows you to finish this one on your own, rather than needing a drinking buddy or significant other to help you out. I find this one enjoyable, with the sweet flavors being inviting rather than repeling. Others may object, but either way it will probably wind up as a good experience."
"I have mixed feelings on this beer. On the one hand, it has a very pleasant aftertaste, kind of a spicy feeling in the back of the throat, a kind of ginger taste long after swallowing. But the first tastes are overwhelmed by the sweetness of the beer. There is little character and it is almost syrupy enough to be described as oily. On the other hand, it has a fantastic reddish color and thick, shaving cream density head and the smell is spicy and sweet (of course). I would humbly recommend the Mephistopheles stout to anyone over this beer."
"Overall: Not bad, nice enough, but just too damned sugary sweet for my liking."
"This is one of my favorite beers. I'm honestly not a fan of Avery's normal line-up. They are a bit too hoppy for my taste. But these big beers like The Reverand, Samaels and The Beast are in my opinion, world class. The Beast pours a beautiful color and just the right amount of head. The nose is fruity and provides a solid hint at how stong this ale is. The taste is astounding. Sweet but not too sweet. Very well balanced. It's a good thing it's so expensive because these things go down way to easy. -And at 14.9% ABV, you could get yourself into a heap of trouble if you're not careful. I highly recommend The Beast."
"Poured into a Kwak Specialty glass, poured a nice brown with a minimal head that leaves a bit of lace, not much though. Smell is pretty amazing you can smell all types of different smells in there, I notice some sweet bread, molasses, raisons, olives and hay dates and whiskey. The flavor hits you like a ton on brickes it is heavy and the alcohol present can be a bit overwhelming to my likes, It is still pretty good and one that needs to be sipped to truly enjoy this remarkable addition. 2006 Edition."
"A fine sipper by the fire this holiday season. The 14.6% ABV is no joke. I may have had this one much to soon. I would like to have this beer two years after having some time to mellow out. I appreciate the excess nevertheless."
"Cheers!"
"A very fine end-of-the-meal beer. Enjoy it as dessert."
"Notes: This is a sipper for sure. It grew in complexity as a friend and I let it warm. Body was a bit light when comparing it to the thoroughbreds of the style. Alcohol was a bit harsh but far from annoying. Money to Value ratio comes up short for such an expensive brew. Try one for the curiosity factor at least."
"A fitting beer for my 666th review on BeerAdvocate."
"I think this one is a little sweet for my tastes but my gf loves it. I think this one is pretty good...just a little sweet...."
"This beer pours a clear ruby-brownish color. The head is three fingers in height, rocky, and recedes slowly into nice lacing. The aroma is enormous. Malt, honey, plums, grapes, figs, and caramel. The taste is sweet; this is probably the sweetest beer I have ever had. It is a complex sweetness though. All the fruit and honey from the aroma are present in the taste, yet none of them are too brash. Surprisingly, there is absolutely no indication of the 14.6% ABV in either the taste or the finish. The mouthfeel is full bodied with nice carbonation. It is fairly silky now, but I suspect that it would smooth out more with age. Overall, this beer is really good. It seems to be beer like, wine like, and mead like all at the same time, and I like that."
"12 oz, bottled 2006 and found at Sam's. Poured this guy into a chalice. About three centimeters of tannish off white head. The body is a deep mahogany with dark red highlights. Smells of raisons, sweet sticky plums, and molasses. Taste is a real kick in the mouth. Tons of sticky sweetness matched with some hop bitterness toward the end of the mid section and then some nice alcohol warm to finish. This beer is definitely different and I can completely understand why some people would be against it's intense mead like sweetness, but with an open mind I drink this to it's end. It smells like any decent BSDA and then tastes like a barely mead mix, which If you don't like mead then sorry. But from reading reviews I expected much less and got so much more. In my book this is a great winter sipper, even if I'm not sipping."
"About all this beer had going for it was the appearnace, which was hazy reddish-orange with good brown head and excellent lacing. Unfortunately, looks ainÂ’t everything. This was so incredibly sweet, in both the nose and taste, that it overwhelmed everything else. I kept sipping it slowly as it warmed, hoping that something else would pop through, even the alcohol, to tame the sweet, but to no avail. It was like drinking a bottle of Karo Syrup, without the corn flavor. This ended up being one of the 3 or 4 on my ratings list which I have drained-poured before finishing. Sorry, but this crap was really nasty."
"If you are a fan of barley wines, old ales and such, this is definitely reccomended."
"D - The high alcohol content alone makes this tough to follow up, with another of this or a different beer. Add in that strong sweetness and it all becomes a little overpowering. I can't imagine wanting anything else afterwards, or wanting to drink another one of these for a good while."
"Overall- Disgustingly sweet. Can't get more than half a pint glass down. Maybe this needs to age a few years to settle it down. Definitely a HUGE letdown!"
"2006 edition. Pours a gorgeous deep mahogany with ruby highlights. Perfectly clear, with russet bubbles streaming upward to a thin but lasting taupe head. Very pretty. Huge, flowery sweet aromas hit the nose first off, along with very sweet-smelling caramel-and-figs. On the tongue, this beer is almost astringently sweet at first, before a dark, honeyed sweetness, coupled with pears and dates, breaks in. Hop bitterness and raw alcohol come in toward the finish; both are felt distinctly, with the alcohol being both distinct and a bit overdone. The finish is quite long and sticks to the tongue tenaciously, with lots of buzzy activity all over the palate. This is one thick beer, with little carbonation and much alcoholic burn. Overall, lots of complexity, some real depth, and definitely need of some aging and a creamy, funky cheese pairing. This could be great in a few years."
"D: The drinkability is severely limited by the sweetness and the intense abv (14.9% for this version, per the bottle). Treat this beer as a nightcap."
"D- It is alright nothing good. It is drinkable but a BIG sipper. Kind of sickly also. Avery lets me down once again."
"Right from the pour I knew I was in for another large beer from Avery. An amber almost burgundy hue on the halo, with a very slight head to it. I actually poured this beer into a reisling wine glass to get a better look at what I was drinking. Nose was of molasses, honey, sweet roast malt, with some alcohol burn but not as much as expected with a 14.6% abv. First taste was of strong honey, malt, raisins, almost tawny port mouthfeel as well. Half a bottle of this stuff almost did me in for the evening because of its commanding way. Only drink this if it is the ONLY thing you drink that night. I opened a Stone IPA afterwards and couldn't taste very much at all. Excellent for a one and done evening."
"Pours a clear mahogony some yeast sediment and a large tan foamy head. The head leaves good lacing,but disappears a little quickly. The smell is very pungent with alcohol,dark fruit, and brown sugar or mollasses. The taste is very fruity,dark fruit, with alcohol, brown sugar, vanilla, maple syrup, and mollasses. This is very sweet, a real sipper with the high alcohol. The m/f is heavy with the flavors mixing OK, but the harsh high alcohol content make this a perfect beer for cellaring and sipping. Not a bad brew,but it could use some cellar mellowing. This is a real sipper like an after dinner drink. Cheers."
"I only wish I had purchased two of these to age one for about four years. I could see this beer being regarded very highly after some time to mellow out."
"A magnificent, warm, complex Winter sipper. Superb all around."
"Bottle courtesy of Brentfeesh: Poured a deep clear burgundy color ale with a small slightly-off white foamy head with average retention. Aroma of sweet cookie dough with some plums and dry fruits is quite pleasing. Taste is mostly dominated by the sweet (maybe too sweet) cookie dough malt and plums, which are quite pleasant, but also a strong shot of alcohol which I couldnÂ’t cared for and kind of ruin it for me. This beer remind me of a 50/50 mix between a sweet barleywine and a strong Belgian ale but really lacking in balance. Body is too light and less filtration would have benefited this beer."
"Overall, this is a beer to have once. It's not good enough to pay such a high price for regularly. But if you are a fan of extreme beers, I'd give it a try."
"overall an incredible accomplishment considering the ingredients and strength of this beer. that being said, I think Avery should do us all a favor and put a few years of age on this beast before release. so complex it seems the beer is fighting itself to come together. not sure when in 2005 this was bottled but considering we are already into mid september of 2006 and its still a little chaotic, I would prefer another year or so on this. wish I had several of these to lay down myself. cheers to avery!"
"received from BeerBeing on the return leg of No BS BiF...the other bottle I have, purchased just about a year ago, is going to be sitting for at least two more years. If it ages as I think it may, it should easily break the 4.0 barrier. Can't wait to try it...later; and thanks to BB for making that possible."
"One of these will do me a very long time."
"mf/d: The feel was thick and syrupy. This was fun to drink but i can't say it is drinkable. It is definately a sipping brew but it is wacked out of blanace by the insane amount alcohol."
"I've never seen so many ingredients in a beer before, and they all get lost beneath the oppressive sweetness and hot alcohol. There are hops in this? I for one cannot tell."
"Interesting...the date on this bottle says 'bottled in 2004' just like the 18.10% version does. Doesn't really make it any easier to drink. It still comes across like Vicks 44, but with more knock-out power. A serious punch to the taste buds. So much going on with beautiful fruity, sweet, nutty, alcoholic aromas. But once it goes into the mouth, play-time is over. Seriously alcoholic for any style. Very hot and fusal, with timid counter-acting sweetness, hoppiness, and character. The emense alcohols thin the what-would-be thick brew. Add in the abundance of carbonation and this beer kicks my ass. Seductive sweet flavors, but with a difficult-to-drink attitude. The beer seems a bit darker and richer than the 18+%er, but it still needs a thousand years to mellow out. Kick me in the Jimmy!"
"Pours a hazed dark amber inot my wine glass with very little head that quickly turns to film in my glass. This beer pours heavy. The smell is of sweet, dried, sugary, raisins, honey, and a decent wiff of alcohol and a subtle hop bitterness. The hops is the only thing that would deter me from thinking this was a dessert wine with my eyes closed. The taste is the same way. The initial hit is of sweetness which is followed by a sharp alcohol hit. Next the flavors progress and separate into raisin, caramel, maybe a overripe apple, and finally some bitternign hops. Finally alcohol hits. This beer is very warming. This is a chewey beer. It is thick and rich and very coating. There is a very long lingering alcohol astringency that makes drinking this beer alittle harder. I dont know if i'd call this as a belgian strong dark ale, but i think i'm learning that belgian strong dark ales have a large variety of flavors. Great for a winter night and especially great as an after dinner drink this beer is def worth a try."
"Pours a med-dark copper with burnt orange hues. Almost no cap at all... very light lacings on the surface right after pour. Pours very thick and syrupy. Aroma is lots of molasses, plum and raisin esters. Touch of bubblegum. Flavor is... hang on still chewing... very syrupy sweet. They have boiled a little too much water out of this one. Very strong sweet honey and molasses right up front, followed closely by vinous and raisiny fruit. There is some bitterness from hops and a bite from the alcohol, but not enough to balance the sweetness. Very dry finish from the high alcohol content and warmth that hangs in the back of the throat. Carbonation is med but hidden from the thickness. Overall a decent beer to get relaxed on a cold night... and for a dessert."
"Overall, an excellent one to try. A very unique beer that i think many would enjoy trying. But as a beer, i see it as a novelty beer for me. I wouldnt mind getting it again, but i wouldnt be in the mood much... i'd pretty much only buy it to let others try it. But still a nice beer to have."
"Alcohol warmth is pretty noticeable right away. Balance is ok, leaning towards malty...alcohol finish could be a little smoother. Definately not a session beer...as for a repeat performance, I wouldn't mind having another, but I wouldn't go out of my way for one."
" As it warms the clarity improves greatly and the mouthfeel becomes more syrupy."
"This is an '04 bottle that has beenproperly cellared. I had been looking forward to drinking after letting it mellow for two years. Unfortuanately, I don't think it has gotten anybetter. About all I could smell was dark cherry, almost like cough syrup. Virtually zero, light-brown head with a fair amount of lacing. The body was a bit hazy. Flavor was incredibly sweet that stayed a long time. I could definitely feel the alcohol as it went down. I was not impressed with this. It was tough to drink the whole bottle. I have a few more in the cellar, but I'm not sure what to do with them."
"Note: Whoa, this will sneak up on you...make sure you have a DD."
"A fairly syrupy consistency and some alcohol kick."
"This was amazing with an old crusty chunk of stilton. The hop flavors actually combined with the ugly moldy dark brown rind to create a little miracle inside my face. Too much alcohol to drink it alone though."
"Over all, I think of a nice barley wine when drinking this."
"The dynamic between sweet and coriander oak makes this beer a superb sipper. Also, this beer does a phenomenal job of masking its sizable ABV."
"Presentation: Packaged in a twelve-ounce brown glass long neck bottle with a pop-off crown. Crown is red foil wrapped."
"Da: Medium. If you are getting mixed signals about this ale - join the club. It has a mix of really good, and some less so, points. Well worth a try if you are into the big ales."
"Cheers2Beers"
"A little to much alcohol up front for the kid! But a very nice beer that would hold its own in Belgium, just doubt it would sell to well @$6,25 ,er 5 euro a bottle. My only real gripe, the price! Having said that, i wish more brewers would go this route versus the $20-30 bomber or 750ML bottles"
"12 ounce bottle. 14.9% ABV version."
"Mouthfeel- Very port like with a syrupy mouthfeel. The sugars really hit the sides of the tongue hard. Might be a little cloying, but a great nightcap beer."
"This is a very drinkable beer, but only modest amount at a time."
"The body is very thick and syrupy. Coats like pepto bismol. Also puckeringly sweet. Very, very undrinkable. I knew what I was getting into, but fuckin' eh, this is too much."
"Batch # 3. Wow, a huge improvement. I would provide some notes, but its getting me to drunk to think."
"This is definitely a hard-kicking sipper. However, what it is IS ""THE BEAST""! Extreme in every way."
"Fairly drinkable, though I feel it would do well with more time in the bottle. Back in the day, this may have overwhelmed the typical palate, but with the explosion of big beers over the past few years, some might see this as the grandfather of the current wave of extreme contenders."
"I'd recomend sipping on this one over a nice dinner. Just smile knowing that you're drinking something far more sophisticated than your dates wine."
"So The Beast, finally. 12 oz. brown bottle, red foil around the neck. Head is small, body is clear brown/red, visible carbonation. I have smelled something like this beer before. Very sweet and malty, but has a rounded, somewhat mellow character to it. It is Samichlaus that I am remembering. Taste is waaaay over the top, sweet, strong malt, raisin, but overdone. Slightly fruity quality to it, but it is hard to get through the brash and obvious alcohol presence. Hard to drink, I like the thought, not the final product."
"The name describes the beer well , it is the beast."
"Urine and syrup. Not good at all. This beer does not seem to be fully fermented. The aroma is dominated by a sickeningly sweet rotten corn husk, urine like odor. Flavors of candied fruits and snow cone syrups overpower anything interesting going on here. The alcohol burns the mouth, nose, and throat. ItÂ’s overwhelming. Finishes sticky like maple syrup left spilled on a counter on a hot July day. Rubbing alcohol flavors linger. Ick! This is one case where bigger is not better. IÂ’d take MilwaukeeÂ’s Beast over this one any day. I suppose that in about a dozen years, this one might be drinkable. IÂ’ll consider revisiting then."
"The alcohol flavor (and 15% abv) makes this difficult to drink. I usually love the high octane stuff, bot not this one."
"Revelation 13:18, KJV"
"Smooth, rich and creamy, a very good beer with great complexity and good balance. Having said that, Avery's Samael is better with about 1% less ABV."
"A surprisingly solid light brown head forms on the pour. Wasn't expecting it with such a high octane brew. The body of the brew is burgandy tone. Lace is sparse, but there nonetheless. Very sweet nose. Raisins and figs and port and molasses and dark fruits...oh, and a little diesel fuel in there as well. The beer is full bodied. Talk about some viscosity. Tends to be syrupy in the mouth as well. Carbonation is minimal. Sweet sensations strike the tongue first. Malty sweet, but also sugary sweet. More sugary sweet. The alcohol really lingers on the tongue after the sip. Leaves a spicy bitterness in the mouth. Decent enough concoction, but it's got a little too much of that ""spiked punch"" feel to it to really enjoy it much."
"Drinkability: hardly... too much alcohol to really enjoy more than one."
"Drinkability: Looks good, smells great, not drinkable yet; maybe in a few years after this beast settles down"
"Pours out a thick burnt brown color, with little head that fades very quickly to nothing. Smell is a heavy, sweet smokey fruit, a raisin or prune quality. Taste is sweet fruits and a light syrupy flavor, finishes with warming alcohol that tingles the throat on the way down. Feels very thick on the palate and is very filling, definitely a sipping beer. Decent at best for this style, I would be curious to see how it ages but probably won't go out of my way to do so."
"2005 release aged properly for about 6 months in my cellar. Pours super-thick to leave a half-finger light brown head over a very cloudy dull orange-brown liquid. Many particulates floating in the beer. Smells sweetly of brandy, a hint of funk, caramel. Has a fruity sweet ester that isn't quite oranges. Some darker character I find in the St. Bernardus series of beers. Molasses and raisins? I love the smell. There is an enticing aroma I can't place. Sweet, yet edgy. Familiar, but fleeting. Almost biscuit or munich malty. Taste starts with an alcoholic umph that is not a nice introduction. Dry, somewhat phenolic. Just overall rather edgy. It has some sweet caramel character but is way over-played by by the alcohol. The thick body allows a rich dark sweet to persist in a manner similar to a barleywine. A hint of darker grain flavor and bourbon smothness. Superthick mouthfeel with modest carbonation. The carb rises through this syrup like the carb in some meads. Definitely an intriguing and challenging beer. Not quite to style or to my flavor preferences."
"Drinkability - criminy, no way. This would be the thing you want tied around a St. Bernard's neck if you're rescued in the tundra, but that's it. I think 'The Beast' would never truly approve of something this sugary."
"Clear reddish-brown. Plenty of fine Belgian yeast sediment floating around and slowly settling to the bottom. Says on the bottle it uses six different varieties of hops, but the hops are so blanketed by thick sugary malts that you can't pick them up very well in the taste or aroma. Hands-down one of the sweetest beers I've ever had. The character is unlike any Grand Cru I've ever had..more like a super-sweet barleywine with a Belgian flair. The brown sugar character is laid on so thick that you'd swear it's liquified sugar you're drinking. Mouthfeel is as thick as cough syrup. Surprisingly, as strong as this baby is, I didn't have any problem putting down the entire 12-ouncer. Would love to cellar this for a decade or so and see how it turns out.. An interesting, ominous brew from Avery."
"Drinkability: I had a very hard time finishing the glass. I like some of Avery's over the top beers, but this one just doesn't work for me."
"Talk about in your face! This one was way too strong for my buds and I normally like the higher alcohol beers. I think this one's alcohol was just a bit too much ""out there"" and not hidden enough, or balanced enough with everything else. Very malty, with some hints of darker fruits, faint hops, and strong smell/taste of alcohol. This one went down more like a whiskey than a beer. I honestly couldn't finish it, so I gave it a bad rating on the D scale. Sorry, this one was just too much over the top for me. I think they could do better."
"Hmm... pours a reddish/ copper color with the minimal head expected from high ABV brews. What the heck is that smell? Kind of a pleasant solvent smell with cantelope, strawberries, deck sealant... singes the nose a bit. A bit harsh on the first sip, with different waves of flavor... a bit of pine resin, toffee, roasty notes, and again, a solvent/ oily feel. This is pretty syrupy, and if it weren't for the coarse slap in the face bitterness and intense alcohol burn, I would be able to tell that it's sweet. As for drinkability... well, we'll see if I can finish this. It's not that it's bad, it's just... challenging. It reminds me of the first time I tried grappa."
"Pours a dark brown-reddish color, slightly off-white head, with a complex aroma: flowery, hops, alcohol, molasses, syrupy. Has a sweet bitter taste-molasses, thick & syrupy, spices, cloves, lightly acidic, soft carbonation. A little too sweet/thick for drinking on its own. Update: letting it warm up clears the thickness, but it's still very sweet. A lesson: temperature matters a lot. This might be more palatable after cellaring."
"Flavor is very sweet and fruity--even more of the raisins and prunes. The alcohol is admirably (and impressively) hidden. Very vinuous and sticky. The fruity raisin flavors really kind of stick to the cheeks, gums and teeth. Strong caramel--very rich--tones. The alcohol becomes more noticeable in the burn as the beer warms. Kind of warming actually. I like this beer a lot, but one bottle and I am done."
"Pours a light amber with a light head that falls to patchy coating over top. Very good clarity too. Nose is sweet...sweet with almost a smokeyness and dark fruityness coated in brown sugar and rum. Awesome. Flavor is thick, but not big or alcoholic at all. I get a super concentrated brown sugar infused with a very light smoke. I'm impressed with this one, as the 03 version I had a while back was really hot and not good. Feel is uber-thick, lightly syrupy. I am really impressed with this brew. Avery has done good with this recipe. I am enjoying it a lot."
"My first encounter with the beast its been a long time comin,poured a very nice deep ruby red with a fluffy 2 finger pinkish colored head that leaves nice sheets of lace behind as it settles.Alcohol dipped cherries really jump out at me in the aroma along with some raisin and maybe a touch of spice perhaps cinnamon,thick mouthfeel that coates the mouth but is very smooth on the way down,whoo this baby packs a wallop like the aroma the alcohol infused cherry is predomenant in the flavors as well with more alcohol and candied figs.One thing I did notice is a light herbal hop underneath all that massive malt and alcohol wich was nice.The Beast left its mark on me no doubt whoo it was damn good but definent one and done for me."
"All I really got to say about it is: whoopeee!"
"Poured into a goblet this beer has a nice ruby/amber color with a pretty light head. The head was short and now pretty much clings to the edges of the glass. The smell is very fruity and sweet. I'm getting mainly dates and molasses, but there is a little yeast and other sugars to detect as well. This is probably the sweetest beer I have ever had. It is so sweet I can hardly detect any malts or hops at all. Pretty much all I'm getting is sugars, molasses, some fruit, and a little sour twang at the end. The mouthfeel is pretty much pure syrup. There is little carbonation, and the mouthfeel is way off balance. The flavor is way off balance too, sickly sweet and verycloying. I was hoping for a little more charecter, or complexity, but whatever depth this might have is totally destroyed by the sweetness. I could maybe... maybe see this being good to cook with, or bake with, but otherwise... at $7+ per 12oz... a real disapointment. Very hard to drink."
"Opinion: Oh my God, how do I describe this? Well...it is big...REAL big with some meaty malt and other flavors that make up this beers personality. It finishes with a warming liqueur like finish."
"Deep garnet color, mildly hazy and topped by a tan head of small tight bubbles that leave a nice sheet of lace on the side of the glass as it recedes. The nose has spice in the front with pepper, coriander, a little orange. The bread/yeast aroma follows next followed by fig from the malt. The flavor has a sweet orange flavor backed by coriander and all spice. The yeast adds a little mid flavor, and then the malt kicks in with the fig and a little toffee. A little alcohol heat on the finish. Nice full, rich mouth feel, decent drinakbility. Many people seem hot or cold on this beer. It seems like a nice beer to me."
"Overall the drinkability is lessened by the extreme alcohol flavor. It is not a bad beer, but I won't be drinking this on a regular basis."
"Drinkability is very average, the flavors aren't bad, just so extreme this can only be enjoyed in small doses."
"One of those beers you either love or hate depending on your view of ""bigger is better."""
"This is probably Avery's best, and it's unusual at that, as they seem to try to hit the mark for the style on their other beers (and grand cru is not a style, it simply means ""great vintage""), but this one is way out there. And, the alcohol is kind of a defect as well, yet all of their other beers are very well done. Let's just call this one a 'crazy-assed enigma'. But I do have one final note... why was this not put into the 12 oz bottles? 22 oz is enough for 4 to share!"
"Drinkability isn't so high. I get the idea drinking this that I am drinking Bourbon and prune juice. It is OK but I won't buy it a second time."
"All and all a pretty good barley wine. It was alot smoother and more drinkable than I expected. I would love to get another one of these and put it away for a few years to see what happened to it's flavors."
"Coppery and clearish, head is greatly diminished and leaves only traces of faint dots on the glass. Impressive aroma, malty to the point of being almost organically vegetal -- a big sniff brings out celery leaves and a soil-like humus. Body past medium with very subdued carbonation, somewhat lighter than I figured. On the sip, there's an immediate prickling of the tongue and lips, like a thousand little paper cuts. Hugely alcoholic -- of the petroleum distillates, maybe closest to laquer thinner by the time the beer makes its way to the throat. Way too stinging, there are some sherry and vanilla tones but they are almost completely obliterated. I don't hate this beer but its too frying in character and its drinkable only to the point that a small glass is plenty."
"Pours a nice reddish amber with a tiny, fleeting light brown head. Aromas of DME and alcohol, along with some spice notes. Mild tropical tones. Alcohol controls everything in the palate. Malt, molasses, honey and ALCOHOL. Very hot on the palate. Did I mention the alcohol? Mouthfeel is astringent, syrupy and very warm. A very over-the-top beer. Part of me enjoyed this beer, but the rest of me realized it is way too much. The alcohol burns the throat. Clad to try it, but way too bold for my taste. If I wanted to drink brandy, I will buy brandy."
"This review was a joint effort between Sean, Mateo and Derren."
"What can one say. This is an intense experience. However, it is far from well balanced. I found it to be crude in its presentation and the alcohol burn was like that of cheap vodka. Quite Beast like. Sampled too early?"
"2003 vintage sampled at OÂ’Briens from a 1.5L Chimay challace. A year of aging does wonders for this beer. Dark mahogany in color, creates a HUGE offwhite head. Aromatics are rich and sweet of carmelized bananas, cherries and yeast. Flavor is loaded with dark dried fruits... figs, raisins, dates, prunes and lots of caramel and a tinge of alcohol. Very full bodied on the palate, with a thick syrupy quality. Excellent dry finish with a very minor alcoholic burn. Top notch."
"Easy to sip, this bottle was gone much sooner than expected, though peer-pressure might have had something to do with it. It proved to be both a good way to start and end the evening. Don't ever think you won't take a shot of tobasco sauce until you have the Beast egging you on."
"Disciples beckon."
"Drinkability? Well, if you're smart, you'll stop at one."
"Deep amber red color, very clear. Very little head, but an attractive color. Smells incredible- I can't wait to get it in my mouth. I smell pineapple and honey. Smell is very sweet. Upon my first sip, the sweet smell disappears into pretty impressive bitter hops and assertive alcohol. Finishes bitter for a split second and then goes sweet again. Very interesting. Mouthfeel is interesting; the hops and alcohol together kind of burn my mouth. I would put drinkability not so high at all, even though I like it. A little has been enough for me."
"Overall, the alcohol is too dominant in aroma and taste for me. A miss from one of my favorite breweries. Rotation: one was enough originally and the re-sample didn't change that. [1x]"
"This beer poured a nice deep mahogney with a 1/2 finger off white head which quickly dissipated into fine lace on top of the beer and around the glass. Was pretty excited at first site. Had a really sweet nuance of molasses and suger. Mind started to wonder at this point. Took my first drink. I was expecting a whole lot more. Flavors of molasses, figs, and dark sweet fruit met my palate. The taste finished with extreme suger after taste. Mouth puckered and decided to wait another couple of minutes to let the beer warm up. Second taste was just like the first. Way to sweet and syrupy feeling in my mouth. Will never buy another Beast. Sticking with The Reverend and The IPA. IMO, Avery's top brews."
"The next morning when I woke up I could still *feel* the beer inside me. It haunted my soul. I felt off, like I had internally soiled myself. Buyer beware."
"I had a chance to try the 04/05 release version at a beer tasting in RFD. the brew was young, and randalized, and fantastic. Adam refined the recepie for the 2nd batch, and I can't wait to try the mature version!"
"Drinkability: I attended a bourbon tasting recently, this reminded me a bit of the Booker's bourbon. Adam stated that this had just been bottled 4 weeks prior, so I'll give the benefit of the doubt. 4 weeks down, 4 years to go."
"Sampled at From The Vine beer tasting Jul 9th, 2004: Pours a ruby brown color with a medium thick and creamy beige head. Decent lacing. You know you are in trouble when you smell this one. Raisins, port wine, malt and chocolate abound. The body is very thick yet startlingly smooth, with flavors of dark fruit, malt, hops and dark chocolate. The alcohol is felt on the throat more than it is tasted. The finish is sweet with roasted malt and caramel. I was really suprised at how easy this beer is to drink, but taking on an entire bottle by myself might be a chore."
"Some day, this might be exactly right....you know, those days when you're chompin' for some prune-and-molasses-augmented diesel. Other days, you'll likely prefer the unadulterated gas to this. And that's probably a cheaper way to go."
"I'll slowly savor it's sweetness, and abide by it's booziness through the end of the evening, and give thanks to ColoradoBeerMan for delivering it to my door!"
"This is a special beer for when the time is right. The alcohol is a bit intense for the size of the bottle, but hey just plan for it!"
"Cheers Raindog for ruining my palate Copper body, rather clear. Off-white film which is actually raher impressive for a 15% beer. Nose is very alcoholic, overpoweringly so, but I must admit thereÂ’s lots of good stuff under. A huge fruity malt of plums, peachs, maple, caramel. Subdued hops profile hide behind the nose burning alcohol. Palate is rather complex of an undescribable intensity. Every bit of your mouth is attacked with flavor and such a beer just canÂ’t be balanced, no matter the malt/hops effect. Beyond words sweetness of maple, toffee. Burning lingering bitterness attack. It honores its name as being a mere agressivity piece of a beer. It would actually be very interesting to contemplate without the gross alcoholic burn. This is tongue-messing, a tongue sunburn, but so complex underneath.. yummy chocolate, plums, dates.. Very full bodied, low-medium carbonation level. Anyway, you know what youÂ’re in for when you buy this, donÂ’t you? ItÂ’s worth trying."
"This is a beer that truly knocked me on my ass! After a night out with xlperro and the gang, this was the final nail in the coffin. But what a good nail it was. This beer poured a dark amber color with a minimal head that did not last long at all. This is a beer that you could smell forever with it's great raison, plum and heavily sweet notes. The taste was so very complex, i'd have to really drink this one before drinking anything else next time to decipher all of the nuances in this brew. The abv is not even detectable due to the fact that the great fruit and hop taste along with the great dark sweetness of the malts cover it up so well. I will be on the lookout for this one again!"
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a frothy 1"" of beige head. Brew is a deeply red amber shade, and lacing is excellent. Aroma is deeply of fruits, with a slight alcohol tinge to it. mainly of hops, but the malt is also evident, just in the minority. Taste is WHOA. Burns my slightly chapped lips with all the alcohol floating around, similar what I would expect a mouthful of rubbing alcohol would be like. The malt and fruit flavors are present initially, but are quickly and completely run over by the alcohol. Disappointing to not even be able to appreciate some of the aspects of the brew, since other aspects are so overpowering. Mouthfeel rating isn't as low as the taste or drinkability, because eventually the mouth goes a bit numb to the alcohol taste. Drinkability is low, because you certainly wouldn't be drinking more than one at a sitting, and the presentation of a 22oz bottle of 15.7% beer is kind of dumb, in my opinion. It'll be lasting the rest fo the evening for me, and I do not foresee restocking another one for my fridge, unless it were for a tasting with visitors."
"I am glad to say I have encountered ""The Beast"" and survived, barely. This is the biggest beer I have ever had, by far! Bottle says brewed in 2004, so this is very young. I could tell it was young just upon the opening of it. Strong alcohol scent burned my nosehairs. The pour was very nice. It had a mohagany red color with a full light colored tan head. The aroma is alcohol solvent and maybe a little dark and dry fruit flavors. The taste was extremely complex. Too many flavors to mention. It really opened itself up the more it warmed and became much more drinkable. The initial flavor when cold was straight alcohol and red grapes. As it warmed more fruits like apples, pineapples, pears, and a little nectarine flavor emerged. Ester alcohol was there the whole time though and dominated my palate. I could taste the added Belgian candy sugars and brown sugars in it. Hops weren't strong enough IMO but were there towards the end. The finish was quite acidic and alcoholic flavored as well. Needless to say the mouthfeel was huge and thick and chewy. I had trouble drinking too much of this though and drinkability is definitely limited. Maybe it should be made in smaller bottles as well? This beer could age for many years and produce numerous different flavors. I applaud Avery for this attempt but it was not ready yet IMO. I don't think that this is a Belgian either, more of a strong ale. I need to get some and age them, just like the Czar."
"BEWARE THE BEAST! It's easy to ignore the high abv in this, due to all the malts, yeasts, hops, and Belgian sugars used in its construction. This is one helluva Belgian style strong dark ale, or whatever you choose to call it. Another excellent brew from Avery. I must admit, that having just one of these will render you useless for doing anything constructive for the rest of the evening."
"Sampled at the Blind Tiger NYC, Bomber bottle. Pours dark amber, tiny bubble head, leaving nice lace. Obviously strong stuff. Bold, complex and nicely spiced. On the sweet side. Alcohol present. Yeasty, malty, nice crunch of drying hops. Not a beeer for a newbie. Belgian lovers and big beer lovers rejoice. This beer has alot going on, wish it was more available in the east"
"This is a big beer and seems like something youÂ’d want to share at a tasting instead of drinking the whole thing. ItÂ’s good but the beer is in between worlds of Grand Cru and Barley wineÂ…I think IÂ’ll move on."
"I gave this thing a pretty violent pour and was rewarded with a small, tan/yellowy head that died fast to film. Oh well. The beer is a dark, dark red and clear. It almost looks like a red wine. Mondo Sucro in the nose. Also: grapes, spicy Belgianity, tangitude and ripe fruit. Alcohol interrupts the sweet, cloying, syrupy front. Middle turns thick. It's buttery, sweet malty, fruity. Alcohol reappears at the end, tying together overripe fruit, grapes, butter. And hops, to be sure. Some nice heat in that alco. This beer is very sweet. It's very strong. But there's some nice butter and malt in there too. I guess it's a little too sweet for me, but it's still a nice drink to sip over an evening."
"A coppery red brown color in the glass, not much head, or lacing. Little carbonation. Okay. I cannot remember the last time I actually poured a beer down the drain. But I made an exception for this one - I drank about half of it, and then in a fit of disgust, dumped the other half. I know. I did wrong. I should have gagged the rest down - after all: 15% ABV... But PLEASE! What were the brewers thinking??? Dates and molasses and raisins are actually used in the beer. Not that it just TASTES like them, they are really there in your mouth!!! Good Lord!! Talk about yucky! AND harsh. I REALLY tried to like it. I LOVE Paulaner Salvator, a similar idea, but a hundred times better. Carob, alcohol and hot molasses burn your throat and stomach. Chewy texture. Ghastly aftertaste. Slightly clove-like Chimay Blau Belgian taste - kind of like drinking cough syrup!!!!"
"This came in a cool 22oz bomber. Pours a dark amber color with a red tint, nice full head and leaves a little lacing on the glass. The aroma was very strong, with hints of alcohol, lots of malts, fruit. The taste is extremely strong. The strong malts are there as is the alcohol taste. At first I didn't like this at all, but then I looked again at the bottle and realized it was nearly 16% abv - allowing me to realize why alcohol was so strong in the taste. This is definately a beast of a beer, but I didn't like the flavor very much. Not very balanced in taste."
"Is it necessary to say the mouthfeel is huge? This is a big beer, but one which bears its alcohol well -- I really would have never guessed the ABV is as high as it is. It contributes in all the way it should to the rich flavor profile of the beer, but is not overbearing at all. Lovely, lovely stuff. (And a sweet looking bottle, I might add!)"
"Overall, I can appreciate the Beast as quite the complex brew. It's just not my bag...too sweet, too much alcohol and I didn't personally care for some of the flavors. It kind of reminded me of a too far over the top version of New Belgium's Abbey. It would be interesting to see what aging does for this beer...I think it could mellow out nicely."
"22oz. Bomber: WOW! Coppery dark amber color. There was about no head at all. The nose contains alcohol, clove, caramel, fruits, god knows what else: there is a lot in there. Sweet taste with smokiness, fruits, caramel, and a bit of alcohol. Very warming. I'm sure there a lot of hops in here, but their flavor is masked by everything else. This is really exceptional."
"Pours a deep dark red-garnet color, it is very clear and is topped by a reasonably persistent amber-tan head. The aroma is strong, sweet, fruity, malty, hint of alcohol, and a hint of smokiness to it. The taste is thick and sweetish. The alcohol is still hot, but it should mellow with age. This beer is definitely fruit, there are notes of plum, banana, and raisin. There is some serious malty action going on here as well, almost approaches the soy-sauce factor. This is most certainly a sipping beer. How can one person finish a bottle, very slowly over the course of an evening, is my answer. This beer is interesting, but I am not sure if I really like it. The beast is certainly an apt description for this beer, perhaps this beer is just a bit too much."
"Drinkability is relatviely high for such a powerful beer. Excellent representation of style."
"There's a good ruby brown body with a fleeting head. It has a slightly medicial aroma and that's accentuated by the alcohol smell. There's butter and a good caramel malt. Not a lot of fruitiness. Actually, I was a bit surprised when I logged in to rate it and found out it was supposed to be a Belgian Strong Ale."
"OK, after Darrens tirade, i'll keep my review short and to the point. The beast comes in an imposing 22oz bomber bottle (complete with red foil around the neck), with a lovely ""black on black"" label that sort of imitates a basil relief. When the crown is pried off and the beer is poured into two chalices it is a dark red colour. The head is small, and loud, and quick to die as well. The aromas immediately remind me of Unibroues Trois Pistoles multiplied to the 10th degree. There is the lovely fresh belgian yeast, the luxuriously complex malt base, the six different types of hops, the raisin and date sugars, the belgian candi sugars, and more! The taste is quite harsh, yet excellently blended considering this brews potent ABV%. The first taste is sharp booze up front with a lovely snap of bitter hops and incredibly sweet, tongue coating malts. The second taste reveals a complex interplay of the many malts and hops used in this brew. This all ends in a fiery, boozy burst of sweet, hoppiness that lingers on the palate for hours, and creates strangely metallic ""beast burps"". The mouthfeel is suprisingly light, and airy for something called the beast. I really expected this to be syrup-like (ala triple bock), but it was not syrupy at all. The drinkability was great for such a strong ale, and i'd definately try this one again in a year or two..."
"PS: I think TheLongBeachBum is following my review with one of his own, and he is an excellent descriptor of Belgian Ales."
"The beer disembogues the bottle a deep sanguineous color with the head Bunyanesque in size, creamy in texture and a toothsome light tan color, the lace a thick and glutinous sheet to conceal the glass. Nose is sweet malt; hints of pineapple, caramel, and the hops also make an appearance, also just a light whiff of fusel alcohol. What a treat for the schnozzle, and the start rich in malt, somewhat sweet, the top full in its feel to the palate. Finish has a stern acidity, the hops masterful in their spiciness, dry and lightly sweet the aftertaste, and just a modicum of alcohol bitterness but overall this monster hides it strength beneath a plethora of flavors to lull the palate and the drinker into to a state of euphoria, then Â“BLAMÂ” the 15.7% ABV, knocks you on your butt, so beware of this Â“BeastÂ”, but do give it a try, another winner from those Â“Masterful BrewersÂ” at Avery, thanks your a Â“HootÂ”!"
"This beer with the menacing beast to fit my wildman image. It poured a dark red amber color and formed a small medium tan bubbly head that receded leaving trace lace. A small amount of carbonation was present. An aroma of malt, chocolate and raisins was present with a hint of alcohol. The flavor was of malt, chocolate and raisin, with a heavy hint of the alcohol giving a warming background to the taste. It had a medium body with a sweet finish, but I somehow expected it to be a bit heavier than it was."
