"Malty, bready, bitter and maybe a little sour."

"Overly sweet taste, can't say I'd recommend this to anyone.  They definitely have better offerings."
""

"Overall: again, this is not a bad beer, but I do prefer this style to be a little fruitier.  It's hard for me to specifically pick out any shochu characteristics here, though I probably haven't had shochu more than about half a dozen times so perhaps that's not unexpected.  Still, I don't get much of anything resembling barrel characteristics."

"Tremendously drinkable and not excessively strong. It's complex, intriguingly fruity, and has that mysterious Belgian yeastiness. From the 3.75 ml bottle purchased in Tucson (thanks, Jason)."

"The overall impression, particularly after a few sips, is one of maltiness with a dark and mild fruity accent. It's pretty tasty and satisfying, though not especially complex overall."

"This was new and sorta weird for me, but i liked it. Sake barrels dominate as it warms, so it gets a bit more boozy and quite dry. Really cool."

"This is one of those beers that have a bit of an identity crisis. Though it's labeled a Belgian ale, I would equate it with malt-forward, lightly bitter, darker-hued DIPAs more than anything Belgian. But it is, nevertheless, fairly enjoyable and unique."
"Not much nose, the scent isn't strong. but the beer has great body, a nice round texture. just the right amount of acidity. sweet, caramel-like cask flavor. Very malt forward with just enough hop finish flavor for excellent balance. delicious. great lacing from the head."
"A good effort, but not without it's problems. Drink it fast, and don't expect any sake influences."

"O: very much in line with the qualities of their other stronger ales... dunno if it's good practices or having fortunately stumbled upon a long-chilled bottle, but their (stronger) stuff seems to hold up and age fairly well... got lucky I suppose"

"Pretty much a “meh” beer, but with the potential to sneak up. This is 8 % and drinks like an unassuming bland session beer, although with the weak flavor why would you drink more than one?"

"o - pretty good beer. definitely tastes like a hitachino, they all seem to have this specific creamy backbone. wouldn't have picked up on the sake if I wasn't looking for it."
"Overall: Very much impressed by this one. The tones of this beer mesh together well and create a unique brew. It's been hit or miss from this brewery for me but this one is definitely a hit. Highly recommended if you are looking for something a little different."
"O- Interesting. A little too fruity. I think the sake character is pulled out quite a bit, especially in the feel."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I dig the sake influence on this one. The sake aroma is very very faint and not perceptable at all unless you know you are looking for it. This beer has a nice head and aroma. The taste is very Belgium like in that you have that aged oak barrel flavor. A nice beer with a traditional old world Belgium flavor. I recommend this one for the novelty of the sake and aged oak barrels alone. The beer itself is pretty darn good."
""
""
""
""
"Notes: Dunno, I liked it, but I was surely expecting a touch more in the barrel/sake edge. Nice brew in any event."

"O - Wouldn't go out of my way to have it again. Unique though."

"Poured a nice, cloudy dark amber with half-finger white head that receded to nice ring of white foam. It looks good, but not as good as some examples of the style. Scents of candi sugar, fruity esters, slight sake and shochu hints, faint nutty hints, very faint hints of alcohol, some Belgian yeast, sweet spices, faint oak, sweet caramel malt, and faint hints of vanilla. The aroma is mild and subdued, but very complex once you smell it for a while and focus on the various aromas present. It's a scent profile that is simple on the surface, but amazingly complex beneath. Flavor begins with an earthy, mushroom-like flavor, sweet candi sugar, slight hints of alcohol, hints of sake, a bit of dark fruit, sweet caramel malt, faint hints of floral and earthy herbal hops, hints of citrus zest, hints of Belgian yeast, slight spiciness, more pronounced on the finish and a roasted flavor on the finish with a bitter, lingering aftertaste. It's an earthy, complex, boozy and very Japanese take on a Belgian Strong Dark. It's got the usual flavors of a strong dark, but with hints of sake and earthiness from the barrel aging and a nice level of complexity. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, with moderate carbonation and a slick finish. Quite nice and easy to sip, and about right for the style. Overall this an excellent take on a Belgian Strong Dark Ale. It has the scents, flavors and feel of the style, but some very unique, Japanese flavors added to the beer, resulting in a very complex, very well executed beer. I recommend this one."

"Pours out a caramel color. Smells of caramel, nuts, and a lot of booze. The flavor is about the same, but with less booze. Lots of sweetness. Not getting a whole lot of ""shochu cask"" (shochu is pretty tasteless anyway). Mouthfeel is pretty full and with a lively carbonation. Overall, this is decent."
""
"Bottle is labeled as 7% ABV for the record. XH looks very nice with its bubbly, auburn look, capped with a foamy tan head, leaning towards the shade of brown. Excellent retention as well. The aroma was a bit earthy, however I did pick up a bit of the Shochu and some pineapple fruit esters. The taste reveals much evidence of aging, with a yeasty, wine like character and the taste of fading hops. That's not to say that the hop flavor was not present at all - much to the contrary - quite a hoppy beer for a Belgian style ale. It's also very bready. Sharp was the finish with some woodiness from the barrel. It felt moderately heavy in the mouth and in regards to perceived ABV. Overall, I quite enjoyed it, as I like aged beer, however if you're looking for a hallmark Belgian Strong Dark Ale flavor, definitely look elsewhere."

"O - Wouldn't try this again, having a very hard time picking any distinct flavors out of this."
""
"(4.0) D: This is very good – Easy to drink with every flavour provided in just the right amounts."
"I picked up a bottle from Hop Jacks in Pensacola. Pours an amber brown color with white head that dissipated quickly. Smells of sweet grass, caramel, touch of sour notes. Taste is mostly sweet caramel and some tartness. Mouthfeel is rather watery. Otherwise, I'm glad I only bought a single bottle of this beer. Not great"

"o/D - A decent Belgian strong (dark) but I don't think it really distinguishes itself. I heard this might be aged in some way, of which I'm curious. I can't read the label to confirm. A bit filling, but fits the role as a sipper."
""
"Pours a murky orange with a foamy bone head that settles to a partial film on top of the beer. Small streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Small particles of sediment are seen floating around in the beer after the pour. Smell is of malt, grain, honey, and fruity aromas. Taste is much the same with malt and slightly sour dark fruit flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer with some interesting aromas and flavors but I am not getting any sake influence on the final product."
""
"Huuge brett aromas are so noticeable now. Im convinced this has brett and it works so well here. Its somewhat sweet but very oaky and really dry. I think the bottling date suggests June 2013...if so, this brew is fantastic if you let it age for a few months. I will definitely pick another one of these up."

"Pours a cloudy, copper color. 1/2 inch head of a white color. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of sweet malt, slight spice, hops, hint of roasted malt, hint of citrus, and a hint of alcohol. Fits the style of a Belgian Strong Dark Ale. Mouth feel is sharp, crisp, dry, and has a average carbonation level. Tastes of sweet malt, hint of roasted malt, citrus hops, hops, hint of sugar, and a hint of rice. Overall, good appearance, aroma, and decent body."

"The beer is a clear, deep copper color. Medium white head. It has a spice and mild vinegar scent. Some vegetable smell as well. Interesting. The taste s equally curious. Semi-sweet. Not much malt flavor, but lots of the vegetable and wood quality. I can only assume that this comes from the sake casks. It is unlike other beers. Moderately bitter. Interesting beer, but not not one that I would have often."
"Poured from a bottle into a snifter, the beer is a muddled, hazy, amber-copper coloring with a very thin, small bubbled ring of white around the surface. Aromas of strong sake overtones with a subtle blend of fig and date in the background. Some cherry and bread in the nose, as well. Smells very rich and boozey at the same time. Flavors are very well blended, almost to the point of neutralizing on the tongue. The sake does give a very wine-like and boozey forward flavor, with a bready backbone and tart cherry and white grape end flavor. The beer loses a lot of the dark, old world fruits on the nose under the influence of the sake characteristics. Tangy and sharp aftertaste, with an earthy, tannin, and boozey blend. Clean, slightly drying finish. Interesting idea for a beer, and I do enjoy the influences imparted from the sake barrels. Would be interesting with a more powerful base beer."
""
"O- I'm sure some people would say this is great, and I know the sourness is intentional, but I can't get past it."
"Overall: $4.69 a bottle. Great beer, very interesting. Would buy again. Sake barrels gave it a unique taste"
""
""
""
"O: Another unique offering from Hitachino Nest. Probably not a beer I would buy again given the price point, but definitely highlights the sake influences present in all of Hitachino's offerings."
""
""
"O: Interesting brew from Japan. Nice sipping beer at 8.3% abv."
"O: Fine beer. Nose is a little stuffy at the moment, so my nose and palate are probably missing out on some stuff. A bit confused. I was doing some research, and other people who reviewed this beer said that it had many qualities similar to a flanders red or an oud bruin, and had a definite sour note, but I am getting little to none of those notes. Also, the bottle that I have is different than others (including a different ABV). I am wondering if they released a non belgian version of this beer. I am confused. Fine beer though."
""
""
"Really interesting beer, I was not expecting such complexity from a Japanese beer. Although a Belgian Brown Ale, it reminded me of a Barley wine, too."
""
""
"Overall: not a bad attempt at a Belgian heavy, but at AU$10 a bottle, it is far, far too expensive - more expensive than most of the highest quality Belgians I have had. Add the awkward flavour combination to that, and it's a Lexus for Rolls Royce-and-a-half price. Not bad, but not good enough to warrant the exhorbitant cost."
"Drinkability: This is a unique and strange little beast. Loads of complexity and I like the fact it is aged in sake casks. Tasty and powerful, this is well-made stuff."
""
""
"Cheers!"
"O - Overall this was worth the wait for me. The sake really compliments this beer. Very interesting and unique flavour profile. I dig it."
"330 ml bottle into tulip glass, 11.03 bottle code. Pours very hazy dark reddish brown color with a 1 finger fairly dense khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of big raisin, apple, pear, prune, pepper, caramel, molasses, clove, earth, toast, chocolate, oak, and yeast spiciness. Damn nice and very unique aromas with good balance and complexity. Taste of raisin, prune, molasses, grape, toast, chocolate, caramel, pepper, clove, earth, oak, wheat, and yeast spiciness. Lingering notes of dark fruits, chocolate, caramel, molasses, clove, pepper, oak, earth, and yeast spiciness on the finish for a good bit. Excellent balance and complexity of flavors; zero cloying flavors after the finish. I have no idea what sake tastes like alone, but I would imagine the unique fruitiness in this beer is that character. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a slick, creamy, and slightly syrupy mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with only a small warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice Belgian dark ale! Very unique with the sake cask aging, and it seems to work out great. Nicely complex and balanced. Really enjoyed this one."
"O: Surprisingly awesome! It just may be my personal taste though, but I thought this beer was unique and tasty."

"Not dissapointed with this brew one bit. Happy to have it again if I can only remember where I bought this..."
""
"Overall, pretty good, and pretty different. It's not my favorite beer but it's definitely worth trying."
"Appearance is brown with some amber in its color. Decent head at pour but disappates,to some head remaining around the reim of the glass. Smell is of molasses but also comes with a decent amount of booziness - definitely can detect the presence of Saki but it's not overpowering. Taste is consistent with the smell but leaves me wanting a bit more."
""
"O. It's a balanced sweetness with hops, but a unique under current that is good, but the first sip is intense."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"not a bad beer, more of an old ale than a belgian dark though. nothing to write home about, but i don't regret trying it!"
""
"Overall/Drinkability: A very interesting beer and it's hard to characterize. It has aspects of a Belgian dark...and it's not a Belgian dark. I'd almost say it would be a better match for a Belgian Strong Pale Ale instead - reminds me of Duvel at times. But even if it is misclassified, it's still a good beer. A slow sipper and a one-at-a-time beer (I don't think I could finish a second in one evening) it's definitely something that grabs your attention. Interesting enough that I could see buying it again though, and so while only one per evening with this one, I think it's still quite drinkable in that I'd be willing to lay down some money again for this one."
"O: While the ABV is not that high for this beer, it is very strong tasting and not the easiest to drink. Enjoyable but one you have to slowly sip on and not one that you could have multiple in a session."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The spiciness of the brew was quite nice, but it did muddy things up a bit. Also, the finish was a bit messy. It's a beer worth trying, but I can't see myself picking this up again."

"Poured into a chalice. Pours dark caramel brown with lots of bubbles and a half-finger length biege head that dissipates, leaving a cap of lace on the surface. The aroma is of toffee, dark roasted malts, dark fruits, and yeast. There is some sake in the aroma as well. Flavors of sweet fruits hit the mouth on the first sip. The sake is detectable in the taste. There is some bitterness on the back end as well. The alcohol also detectable in the taste. This is a very unique tasting beer. This beer has a medium to full body and the lively carbonation makes this very easy to drink. Overall, this is a solid beer and an interesting take on the style."
"Overall a pretty good beer. While some aspects were really great like the smell, the taste was good. I wish there had been a little bit more distinctness in the taste but still a really nice drink."
"Pours a hazy dark gold color with one finger of a slight off white head which retains well. The head leaves nice lace on the sides of the glass. The aroma has a sweet dark fruit smell up front along with a slight oakiness and then a sake aroma to finish off the beer. The taste is very intense at parts. Up front there is a sweet dark fruit and slight citrus taste, that taste gives way to a big sake bomb in the middle and back end. The sake flavor comes in intense and dominates. The mouthfeel was low to mod carbonation. Overall this is a very interesting beer, the taste is big and bold, but it is rather unbalanced. I really liked the taste but it needs some smoothing out."
"O: Very good. Would buy again once in a blue moon."
"C+"
""
""
""
"A decent brew, which gets better as it warms. The sake casking it quite evident in its aroma and somewhat in the taste. Pleasant enough, but not one I'd rush out to have again at $4 a bottle."
"O: Overall this beer seems heavier than it's ABV. Good well done Dark Ale from Hitachino. Another great beer from this brewery."
""
"Overall this is a pretty interesting beer. The variety of flavors is quite interesting but the intense dryness can get to be a bit too much. If that was tuned down I could score this a few points higher."
"Pours a murky brown/ruby with massive, healthy carbonation that produces dollops of tan froth, probably two fingers worth. The smell is complex - an array of fruits from light to dark and most noticeably plum. A touch of funky yeast bits but it's primarily a dark and well-balanced sweetness. The taste is deceivingly soft and delicate. The bits of Shocyu come through in a tart burning bitterness on the far back of the tongue. A bit of sweet grains and soft fruit. The creamy dense cap on this makes it fun to drink, adding a velvety drinkability. Overall, this is a very unique beer that I'll likely seek out again in the future."
""
"DRINKABILITY: This beer took forever to pour due to its heavy carbonation -- too much in my opinion. Other than that, it was an interesting brew. A bit on the high alcohol side for repeating too much, two would probably be my limit on this sipping beer. I have to say that I've had many strong dark Belgian ales and this one didn't particularly stand out. Probably would choose something else next time but certainly wouldn't turn one down if it was offered to me."
""
"D- what a tough call. This beer is obviously made with integrity and quality care, but the mix of flavors just don't agree with me. I like sake and I like barrel aged things and hoppy things but I feel that to better suit my tastes, a fruitier strain of yeast would better compliment the woodsy oak flavor and keep this one from being so scratchy and rough."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, an interesting beer. I wish I had more experiemce with sake to be able to pick more of the sake profiles out, or attribute them to sake correctly. Not something I think I will buy again, unless its to revisit after some sake tastings."
"O: Definitely not a traditional strong ale. It came off as interesting… Adequate, but I don’t think I would buy another anytime soon. I think the Espresso Stout is best brew I’ve had from Hitachino so far. I can’t in good faith recommend this one, unless you get it for a good price. Cheers!!!"
"Bought this in Kyoto for a trip on a night bus back to Tokyo. Thought the relatively high alcohol content would help me sleep. I'm a big fan of Hitachino, but this brew missed the mark with me a bit perhaps due to the aim of this beer. Advertising it as an Extra High alcohol content, the taste is a bit sharp and abrasive in place of moments where more flavor or subtle notes could have shown through. Don't get me wrong -- it is an amazing dark brew with lots of caramel and coffee scents that instantly warms you the way a good strong brew should. I found the scent to be a little harsh on the nose, but the mouthfeel was spot on. I was a bit torn over this particular Hitachino, and while I enjoyed it, I don't think I will be buying it too many more times. I respect the XH idea, but not at the cost of potentiality in other areas such as flavor."
""
"D - Could have a few. BTW, mine was 7%."
"An enjoyable, easy drinking beer for rare occasions. Possibly best as an after dinner beverage."
""
"This beer poured a hazy orange, with a white head, the aroma was malty with a hint of the saki smell. The taste was good with a slight citrus but mainly malty and the aftertaste was really a saki taste, overall this tasted like a Belgian strong ale with a unique after taste that I truly enjoyed."
""
"anxious to see what else is on offer from Kiuchi."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The pour is a somewhat murky light brown color with a finger of off-white head. Wow, a really strange aroma to this. It's got an almost grape soda kind of note to it. Seems like a little bit of chocolate and anise not to it as well. Maybe a light fruity tartness. Tastes quite toasty with some more of the sweet grape soda flavor. A bit of grass and bready malt is also there, maybe a hint of chocolate. On the light side of medium body with medium carbonation."
""
"This brew is different than most. It has a dark, almost musty flavor with a slight bitterness."
"Pours an opaque, warm-glowing copper color with a solid finger of foam and effervescent, champagne-like bubbles rising to the surface. Lacing sticks thickly to the glass wall, and retention is very good. Smells like warm caramel malt with spirits (I guess the sake), along with a slightly boozy, fermented apple and some oak (opens up more as it warms). In the taste you get more of the fruit you would expect from a Belgian which mixes with a hefty dose of alcohol spirits. Very dry. Medium body and carbonation. Overall, an interesting interpretation of the style. I'm all for experimenting with barrel aging. Although a little fatiguing to drink an entire bottle, I may have to try this out with Asian food. I can see that working well."
""
"Looking at other reviews I wonder if my bottle went bad. What I had was something like a Sake-Beer with almost none of the Belgian characteristics coming through. This beer needs some sort of richness from the malt to better balance, too much sake going on for my tastes."
""
"Poured from an 11.2 oz bottle into a chalice at cellar temp. Bottle says abv is 7.0%; BA says 8.0%. Perhaps this is an older bottle? Forms very little head; there's some white lacing on the surface and a ring around the beer. The liquid is a clear dark amber. The nose is plum, cherry, red fruit. Maybe a trace of clove? More of that on the tongue, with a delicate hint of wood and some yeast character right before the fairly dry finish. It's light on the tongue, and prickly. Overall, a pretty nice beer, well balanced though tending toward the lighter side of the style. More of a dubbel than a strong dark, I think."
""
"Easily my fave from Hitachino, to date."
"Tasty little ale, not sure what I was expecting but I'm not let down. BA classifies this as Belgian Dark...tastes more like a double IPA with the hoppiness cut in half. Either way, worth a try from this intriguing Japanese brewery."
"O: Not too bad for a strong ale. It is unique in the fact that it is aged in something besides an oak or bourbon barrel."
""
""
"O: High hopes for this one after the smell, but the taste of it just doesn't hold up to it. Its just missing a finish and some complexity, and it would be an easy A. But until then, its in the B range for me."
"Another very intriguing and interesting beer from Kiuchi. While this doesn't smack me across the face to open my eyes like the Japanese Classic Ale does, it lends some interesting twists to a genre, and delivers a fine beer-drinking experience along the way."

"I bought this one for a novelty as much as anything else: I was just curious to try something from a sake cask. I liked the aroma a lot, and the flavor seemed to grow on me as I sipped it. This is one I would recommend that anyone who is interested in it should try for themselves."
"Overall a nice beer which seems miscategorised as a BSDA. Seems far more appropriate to call it a Barleywine."
"Overall: An interesting beer, kind of all over the place. Mimics some of the great sours of Belgium, but in a confused manner. I find it somewhere between bad and great, but I can also understand it being revered as both."
"O: I feel honored that I was able to taste this beer. Hitachino Nest has never disappointed and this is no exception. I only wish this was easier to come by so I could experience it more often and share it with friends. I never thought I'd try a better beer than Hitachino Nest's Red Rice ale, but I think this may be my personal holy grail."
"This is a tough beer to rate. Comparatively to other Belgian Strong Dark ales I've had, this one is lacking in a lot of areas. The hints of sourness are... atypical to say the least. The funkiness that I typically associate and enjoy with Belgian-style beers is not really present. However, the beer itself is actually pretty good. Great alcohol content, great body, and a flavor profile that is pretty tasty. Not a bad beer guys."
"Taste is rich malt with a kind of dry bite. This is a really different kind of beer. There's no real yeast aroma or taste as I've come to expect in a Belgian ale. Hops are present, but very subtle, only to balance the malt. Mouthfeel is crisp and dry, presumably from the sake barrels. I still can't reconcile the aroma with the taste. There's really not a lot of complexity in the taste, I'm just getting dark malt."
"This beer sings, and I'm all ears (and tastebuds). I immediately returned and bought every bottle they had at Whole Foods. This is going to be a cornerstone beer and one that I will love fooling beer geeks with blind tastings."
"Overall a very good, intriguing beer!"
"overall: unique variation of the Belgian style, some may be a bit dissuaded by the inherent dry and somewhat flavorless sake notes, but they serve to contrast and make the Belgian notes stand out, definitely worth a try."
"Pours a murky dark caramel with moderate beige head that lasted all the way down. Nice lacing. The nose has a pronounced fresh green apple, fortified sake sweetness, and a really great funky presence. Reminded me instantly of oerbier reserva. Flavor is bright with a balanced backbone, but hits a bit hard with the acidity and finishes syrupy sweet. The flavor imparted by the shochu casks is a great marriage with the style, although it would be much more quaff-able if it were more attenuated. Worth checking out, though I recommend splitting a 12 oz bottle."
"D -- I have to admit, I didn't know what to expect and this wasn't even on the radar. Well executed and novel, but I'm not sure if this would appeal to many. I definitely appreciate it, but wouldn't see having it on the regular."
"CONCLUSION: This is only my second All-5's rating. I find no faults with this beer other than that it's so hard to find! It's a very unique (and Japanese) take on both the barrel-aging concept as well as strong Belgian ales (Yes, I do not think this should be called an “American Strong Ale”. “Belgian Double Ale” would be more appropriate, in my opinion). I'd never heard of, or even thought about aging beers in sake casks so this was my first sampling of such a style. So, Kiuchi Brewery is setting the bar pretty high for future tastings!"
"Overall - It's tough to rate this, since the initial flavors aren't bad and the aroma is actually nice, if not kinda weird. The aftertaste and finish is just disgusting, though."
"Overall I am not too crazy about this one, much of the excitement generated from the smell doesn't come off in the taste. It's a great looking beer though I must say."
"O: This beer had some interesting parts to it, especially the unexpected sweet fruitiness. At the same time, a lot of mediocre qualities took a lot of attention in this beer and made it hard to give it credit for being anything other than just a bit above average. I like Hitachino and they've really impressed me a couple of times, but this is one of the weaker offerings I've had from them. Wouldn't recommend going to any exceptional length to get a hold of this, or even recommend trying it unless you have some strong interest in doing so."
"O - I'm a big fan of this beer and always happy to find a bottle. Delicious."
"Overall: The sake cask aging was interesting, but the feel is so light, and there is a lingering dryness that makes it tougher to drink. The complexity redeems it somewhat, but I still probably won't have this again."
"O: Read above."
"I'd love to have this with some sushi--something tells me it would go great with albacore..."
"I ordered up a glass and it was brought to me as a hazy orange color with a pretty nice looking head on it. The retention laced the glass with every sip. Had the look of a really good brew. The smell was a little different then expected. The smells of some hops and some wood came through along with some light fruit aromas. The taste wasn't really what I was expecting. I thought that it'd have some dominant Sake flavors throughout, but it didn't. The flavors were a little bit herbed and a little bit bitter. The mouthfeel was decent, overall I would drink it again to give it another shot."
"Finish: Clean ,tasty and of medium length. The taste of Cinnamon and Coriander come through, even some really ripe orange and cherry explode on the finish."
"I like the creativity with the sake casks. The alcohol is a pretty dang strong however. This tastes and feels like a twelve percent beer, not a seven. Definitely worth a try if you are into sake or want a beer that is one of a kind."
"Light brown almost brunt orange color to this brew; some decent lacing which quickly deteriorates. Aroma is spicy; some figs and vanilla and a dominating woodsy characteristic left over from the cask aging. Also an alcohol tinge which I can only assume is sake mixed with a sour citrusy flavor. Sweet malts with a slight bit or sour and oak stand out in the taste. Boozy aroma is well hidden in the taste, though this is a big brew. One of the most unique brews I have had."
"D: Very good drinkability and a fantastic beer! Very unique! I will be picking up more of these."
"I had looked this one up the other day then found a single bottle behind a bunch of clutter at work. Score! The second I even thought about popping it open it began foaming. It gushed all over my counter but I only lost a couple ounces. This beer pours a muddied brown with ruby highlights and a one finger light beige head. The foam dissipated over a couple minute span and laced the glass. The aromas are pretty sweet. I didn't expect that at all. I've never had sake, so don't know what it smells like, but I'm pretty sure it doesn't smell like this. It's very fruity. It really reminds me of Dogfish Head's Red and White. It smells like it has light wine barrel aging to it. The flavors are sweet and fruity. There are dark fruits as well as some citrus and it finishes with an alcohol flavor that I can't quite pin down (probably the sake). Unfortunately, this off alcohol flavor is the main flavor of the after taste. It too bad because it is pretty fruity and pretty flavorful. I like it for the most part but the off flavor drives down the drinkability a tad. Pretty good beer overall."
"O: not sure what to do with this one; if you sake notes were gone, I think I'd like it a lot more; I really like sake by itself, but it just doesn't work when combined with the beer"
"Surely this is a bad bottle. May revisit but considering the price, I'd hate to be disappointed again."
"D - A very tasty take on a Belgian Dark Ale and definitely worth a try. Hitachino seems to offer some very tasty beers, and I will be sure to check out more of their product line in the future."
"I've never thought an 11.2 oz beer was too small for a review but my glass is gone and I'm still trying to decide what I wasted. Extremely drinkable though a touch too watery for its own good."
"The complexity of the beer reaches very high marks although the base beer claims more unresolved sweetness than dry maltiness. But the harshness of alcohol and tanin seem to be unnecessary and provide the only real detractions."
"I really enjoyed this one!"
"D: Although the alcohol is well masked from the taste, the beer needs to warm up before it becomes drinkable. There's no way that I could drink more than one of these in a sitting."
"D: Interesting beer. Worth trying and worth buying again to show your friends, as the Sake profile is pleasant and unique. However, I would say that this beer is too big for it's own good. The alcohol is too overwhelming for the body and other flavors to handle. A promising concept."
"It's a deep brown pour, with a foamy tan head that disappears quickly. The smell is like a biscuit that was flavored with unfermentable sugars. The taste is basically the same although a lot more depth with wood and hop, but with a little too much sweetness. It's good for a first beer after work, just to kill the tension. It could use some more hops to balance that sweetness. These rednecks need to get a hold of some cascade hops. There's more to making a good beer than slapping a pretty label on it and charging a fortune. This is why I stick to Oolonghais most of the time. Oh and it's 8.00% ABV. It's not retired, they probably just don't export it to the U.S. anymore. I live in Ibaraki-ken. On Wikipedia it's listed as a Belgian strong ale, not an American strong ale. Which is right? Dunno. For anyone living in Japan and wants quality alcohol at a reasonable price, you should switch to shochu."
"D - the flavours are very unique and pungent, you would never guess this to be an 8% beer, this could be sessionable"
"Whether or not this is what the brewers intended, it is enjoyable."
"This didn't do it for me. Maybe I just don't understand what it's supposed to be?"
"This is another good beer. I'm kind of curious about the heavy foam up. Makes me think that this could have been over sugared when it was time for bottling. I guess that means more testing is in order, dang :P So to wrap it up I think this is a good beer and it had a very interesting flavor from the sake barrels, which has to be unique to this brewery. After now trying two beers from this brewery I really want to try all of their offerings. If you like belgians then try this one out. My local beer store is selling these for $5.99 for a 12oz single."
"D - hey, I love me some sour/funky ales...and I could drink this one all night."
"I didn't realize this was going to be a sour ale, and I am not sure if that's what they had planned, but this is very enjoyable. This would probably age well for many new years to come."
"T: I was surprised to find that this beer was pretty sour. I got a lot of apple cider vinegar with hints of brett and tart green apples in the taste along with some nice sake dryness. Pretty solid."
"Pours a murky orange with a bit of crisp white head that dissipates quickly. smells hoppy and sweet. very odd combination with the sake smells. Tastes a bit sweet. mostly dry with very unusual Sake flavours. Definitely unique. Decent mouthfeel but the strange flavours definitely hinder the drinkability"
"Drinkability: Love the complex layers within this beer, while remaining compulsively drinkable."
"Pours an amber color. Medium to fuller body mouth feel. Slight funk - sourish yeasty taste. Wood is on both the nose and palate. Sake flavors are very subtle. Green apple flavors. This beer is very approachable and one of my favorite cask aged beers."
"D: it actually drank quite well and kinda reminded me of a wild ale with the bretty character and intresting choice of barrels to age in."
"Had this after a few winter warmers and it fit right in with its nuanced mix of hops and malt and a dark caramel note on the finish. I detected more British than Belgian in the flavour profile but thought it a very well done beer that would stand some cellaring"
"one and done, but i would drink this again. this to me is exactly like a belgian flanders red/ oud bruin. a nice beginners sour. the funk is definatly there, but nothing overpowering. worth one bottle."
"Not a bad beer, but not sure if I would seek this out again considering the price per 12oz."
"D - An unusula take on the style then again i'm not suprised from the brewery. Thoroughly recommended."
"Not a bad beer, but it does not seem to come together."
"D - A pretty good beer but I wish the taste was more on the sake side. A overall good belgian that I want to revisit again."
"D: The higher potency of the sake doesn't register in the ale (under 8%, really?). The lack of depth beyond the barrel is the biggest complaint."
"An interesting brew. I'd never tried Hitachino Nest before, and I was impressed."
"This beer is just a little odd and fails to work for me. WHile I can see elements of what they were aiming for it doesn't hit any real high notes for me."
"fairly high drinkability; almost wished the sake were a bit more forward; however I did enjoy the subtle and nuanced flavors; will seek out another bottle..."
"Totally Hitachino. A nice twist of sour and tang thrown together well enough for a fun experience."
"D - This is a good interesting beer I enjoyed the tartness in the flavor very enjoyable worth hunting down to give it a try sometime"
"D: A unique beer thanks the the ageing process. Full of flavour and at 8%, it's ideally a slow sipping beer but I found myself going through it rather quickly (perhaps a bad idea). I really like it."
"D: Unique combination of elements feels like a mash-up between a Farmhouse Ale and a Strong Ale. Will try again."
"Pours a super-cloudy orange amber. Heavily carbonated, and pours a creamy two-finger head that is persistent. Leaves excellent lacing. Aroma packed with funk, cherries, some mustiness. Maybe even a little pine nut. Flavor is bizarre and carries a lot of the aforementioned mustiness. Super tangy upfront, too. Very unique. Some barnyard-ish qualities fill up the middle, and the finish is very long, dry and bitter in sort of a good way, sort of a bad way. I'm guessing rice is used in the brewing process, as it has some malt-liquor like qualities. Very unique, as I stated, all the way around. Pricey at $5.49/11.2 oz. bottle, bringing down the drinkability. Not terrible, not great...somewhere in the middle ground between unique in both a bad and good way."
"This beer has a kick, the taste of sake is very noticable with a wheat finish. It pours dark red and smells kind of like sake. Has alot of burn alchol burn in the mouthfeel. Certainly wasn't what I was expecting (normally in my experience with japanese beers they use alot of gimmicks to appeal, this beer really does have a sake taste though). Despite this though I'd say it is a very enjoyable bitter beer."
"This is a very interesting beer. It has a lot of barrel flavor. Caramel, oak and sake are all strong. It also has a vinous, cidery note. The beer tastes somewhat sweet. The fruitiness is more apparent. The mouthfeel is smooth and full. It suits the beer well. It's a very enjoyable beer with big full flavor."
"The store in Tuscaloosa, AL that I purchased this bottle of Hitachino Nest XH from has essentially an entire case of it left. I am pretty sure that no one else will buy any. I am pretty glad that I can go an pick up a bottle whenever I want to. This is one of the rare beers that I come across that is completely unique. You must try this if you haven't already."
"Mouth feel is good. The beginning is quite carbonated but that clears up and goes to very smooth mouth feel. Overall, this is an appealing and easy to drink beer."
"D: Can't do more than sip this."
"Good drinkability for a bottle-full, but would not want to seesion this beer. Feels like it would actually make you more thirsty. glad I got to try it, not sure if I'll pick up more. Maybe to cellar a few, though."
"Good carbonation...fizzy on the tongue, but a nice brew."
"Overall: Let the beer come to room temp before drinking to smooth out the sour taste. I would recommend trying, as this is very unique tasting beer."
"Nose is somewhat floral, I'm not a huge sake fan but this is surprising me. Very sweet, like many Hitachino Nest beers. ABV is well hidden. Goes down very smooth. Little bits of oak on the tongue, but the nose, my god, this doesn't even smell like beer! I could enjoy quite a few of these!"
"What a unique and interesting beer. Straight off the bat I am going to say that it tastes like olives and almost reminds me of a gin martini in beer form. It really is quite nice. There is a delicious sake overtone masking the hops when you smell it. This complements the gorgeous amber color very well. The only thing that this beer loses points on is the head. It is huge and it is very hard to pour this beer. I thoroughly enjoy this even though it is a little pricey. I would love this with some sushi."
"overall - very interesting beer. probably not my favorite style of beer with the sake aging, but its pretty good."
"Right off the bat I thought this was going to be a drain pour. Fortunately I gave it some time and ended up really liking it. Give this one a fair chance. If nothing else, it is one of a kind."
"D- It was alright, not something I'd buy again though. Stick with the Espresso Stout from Kiuchi and you're good to go!"
"Thanks to a74gent for the want!"
"Moderate and medium carbonation and body with a non-traditional package of flavors, this beer drops its character on you upfront and a complex fade towards the end when it dries away rather nicely."
"D - unique one here...i can taste (and smell) the sake influence though i wouldnt think it was sake-aged. much more hoppy than expected, goes down considerably easy though wears after a bit. leave it to the Japanese for something like this."
"Overall, a little pricey, but still a well made beer."
"I'm in a good mood and I had just finished a glass of quality sake before I had this which I think actually enhanced the phenolic influence from the sake casks. Every now and then you have a beer that reminds you that it isn't a competition to see who can make the best beer in the world. If there were more beers like this in the average bar or bottle shop I would be a happy chappy. Dark ochre in colour with some pleasant pine driven op aromas up front tailed by caramel malt goodness. A full bodied mouthfeel with some more of those piney hops and phenolics, balanced with unobtrusive but obvious bitterness. Smooth, tasty, delish."
"I guess I'm not a fan of sake casked beers because I had a hard time finishing this one."
"D= I'm not too sure what category this beer would fit into. American Strong Ale is a catch all but I don't think this fits into that category. Decent brew but nothing spectacular. I wish I had more sake cask beers to stack up against this."
"d: I wasn't sure what to expect, but I was excited to try something so exotic sounding. I was let down though, this just wasn't for me."
"D: This was an amazing beer, but ultimately it bordered on being just a bit too complex. One serving was great, but I feel it'd be pushing it with two."
"This is a really good beer. I am glad I gave it a second shot. I would definitely go for round #3."
"Well I'm getting more of this stuff, this is good enough for a case purchase IMO. I cant believe I held out this long. Great stuff with great drinkability with a light alcohol level considering the barrel aging. If your into weird beer, this will be right up your alley with weird being a good thing."
"D- we got some very interesting stuff here. Extremely complex but very drinkable. Ill have to try some more of hitachinos offerings."
"D: The astringency/bitterness in the funky flavor is too much to drink multiple of these. Still, very surprising and quite different from what I expected, definitely one I will revisit."
"Based on other posts, my insane carbonation on this little guy seems par for the course. As a result, a huge frothy head sits on top a hazy, cider-like color, accompanied by some sticky lacing. Surprising barn-yard nose afronts pear and grass notes. Grape and faint citrus notes on the front and mid palate, along with some soft vanilla and very faint smokiness. Nice smooth mouthfeel despite high carbonation accompanied by a nice warming finish."
"D - Drinks very nicely. Somewhat light, very enjoyable."
"D - Dont see why one couldnt have a few of these. Would want it at the end as the bite could kill the pallet for later."
"D - A nice enough beer worth trying."
"D - Pairs exceptionally with spicy food."
"Basically, for someone who isn't necessarily a fan of strong beers, this one was very drinkable and the taste or smell of alcohol wasn't too overwhelming."
"Not bad, but I doubt I'd go for it again. Possibly if I became more familiar with sake my appreciation of it would grow. Can't say I love the interplay of sugary & dry, but definitely had something to offer."
"drinkability: finish makes it a little challenging, but this is a beer worth seeking out for sure"
"Not very drinkable overall, with the flavors seeming all a little out of balance. I was hoping for a bit more sake character, but being aged in casks that held distilled sake, that could explain things a little. Still, a pleasantry if only a once-in-a-lifetime quaff. The concept of aging in sake casks sounds interesting, though, and I'd certainly like to see some brewers (Japanese or otherwise) take up the practice, perhaps with lighter base beers that will allow the character to show through better. Some interesting brews would undoubtedly result."
"The taste was nice and tart with some fruit notes. It reminded me of a flanders style beer at first. Some wood came through as well. I'm sad to say that I've never partook in drinking sake so I cannot report on any influence in this beer. Overall it had a decent funky brett flavor profile but everything seemed muddled and sloppy. The carbonation was on the high side and became distracting forcing me to take smaller sips in order to savor the beer properly. An interesting beer for sure and glad to find it on tap."
"There's some sediment on the bottom. I was surprised how quickly the infusion of sake and cedar grew on me. By the end of the bottle I was positively enjoying it!"
"Im starting to really appreciate this brewery after their first few brews that i tasted as they have definately been different and tasty whcih is a good thing in my books anyways this brew pours a deep mahohany hue with nice carbonation that leaves a one finger creamy,cloudy head and a subtle ring of lacing which clings to the glass after every sip,the aroma is sweet but not with toffee,caramel notes first up followed by an underlying piney hop aroma,it has a full mouthfeel almost like a fine whiskey with carbonation and has tastes of cherries,toffee,caramel and finishes with a citrus,bitter piney finish and suprisingly the 8% ABV is very well hidden,overall not bad and will buy again."
"The beer pours an orangish-amber color with a tan head. The aroma is basic caramel malt with some fruit and yeast. The flavor is completely different, with brett funk, citrus fruit and a good amount of tartness. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"Served orangish amber with tons of head and carbonation. According to the bartender at Monk's, I had one of the first pints off the keg, so not sure if that was the reason for the crazy carbonation or what. Whatever the reason I ended up getting more beer as she topped it off when I was half done. Hooray! This beer had a definite cedar smell. Aroma was a of brett funkiness and then plenty of wood, no doubt from the sake barrels. Taste is very earthy with more wood. It is initially sweet, but with a sour bite in the finish. Some caramel notes but it seems like this is one of those beers that is dominated by the aging vessel. The alcoholic strength is definitely well hidden and integrated. I found this beer to be on the heavier side of medium, but with a surprising smoothness that gave way to a slightly sticky finish. A tasty and interesting beer, but not terribly drinkable. To be honest I had also hoped it would be weirder."
"Definitely enjoyable and I will have it again."
"I Pop!ped the cap and began a heavy-handed pour that caused a pseudo-cascade, settling into just over three fingers of dense, French Vanilla-colored head with good retention. Color was a hazy Amber to Deep Amber/Light Copper (SRM = > 9, "
"Pours a nice, slightly hazy golden amber with a decent, fine-bubbled off-white head. Aroma is yeasty and malty with just a hint of fruit, not anything special but still appetizing. Flavor has a strong alcohol bite, perhaps a result of maturing in sake barrels. Otherwise it is fairly malty, a little fruity, a little yeasty and slightly sweet. Texture is smooth, edgy and quite lively."
"Greater than the sum of its parts, unique and enjoyable by the end of the glass, a beer definitely worth revisiting."
"D - Very good and similar to the Red Rice Ale. I wonder how this would be with a Sushi made of stronger flavored fish."
"Medium-light body. Carbonation level is appropriate. It's an easy drinker, but not a particularly exciting one."
"d: i'm not sure i would try this again; it was interesting and sour with lots of wild yeast notes but was not my favorite; it is probably worth one try, though."
"I wasn't expecting this to taste so much like a Japanese barrel-aged DIPA, but it surely does. If we're seizing that thread, then maybe this is a little restrained on the overall hop and malt profile in comparison to the NA versions, but enjoyable nonetheless. As a BSDA, however, this is as confused, but still as determined, as a first-time condom purchaser."
"(D)- Definitely a different beer that caught me by surprise, but still delivered fairly well. An interesting body & profile that I enjoyed, but i dont know if it fits into the style due to its sourness, maybe its just a japanese thing? Definitely never have heard of a beer aged in sake casks before."
"Poured a tawny leather couch brown with foamy, gushing head that caught me off guard that died quickly and left lace patches. A strong caramel and sweet malt smell along with hints of dark fruit (like berries or cherry or something) and bits of hoppy bitterness and faint roasted smell, which I am assuming is coming from the casks. Strong malt presence when I first sip that leads to a sweet base that underlies a sharp, sour tasting hopiness (cherry, berry, lemon/citric). The sourness passes over the tongue sharp and prickly thanks to some lively carbonation and the finish is a warm, dry finish that gives off a little woodiness. A sipper with some balls, to put it bluntly."
"D: Interesting and flavorful, yet light enough to be incredibly enjoyable."
"D: Very interesting offering from Hitachino--great to see unique things like this from abroad."
"O: The best beer I've ever had from the land of the rising sun, yet underwhelming in the grand scheme of things. It is quite possible that I am looking for flavor that this beer never intended to produce, but I find the flavor lacking a complexity that I seek for this style. The amazing aroma makes me look forward to trying more brews from Kiuchi Brewery in Naka City, Japan, though I may not pick this one up again."
"Purchased from Blue Max Liquors in Burnsville, MN. Pours a murky, dark reddish brown body with a huge pillowy off-white head. There are globs of sediment floating around and settling in the bottom of the snifter. The aroma is one big sour mish-mosh of belgian yeast. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and highly carbonated. The bottle actually foamed out a little after I popped the cap. Sweet syrupy flavor that has a tart and sour finish. I can't detect any sake. I guess this is what you get sometimes when you buy ""experimental"" beers. I couldn't even finish this one."
"NOTE: I recall having a bottle of this stuff a couple years ago, and I don't remember any infection at all..."
"This is my first sake cask aged beer and I am not sure what it really adds. A little over priced for what you get. Still a nice, balanced beer."
"Ordered a bottle at the Acadia Cafe. It was import night and $5 instead of $10. I was expecting sake and barrel character, but instead I got a surprisingly good sour strong ale. The brett is right up front with a sour citrus and earthy notes following. There's a bit of orange rind and grapefruit that could really be wild yeast or hops, but it tastes good and the source doesn't matter. There's a slight sugar candy taste I assume comes from the sake barrels, but this is really a big sour beer."
"Beer is low bodied, much lower than I expected. Finishes cleanly. There is a definite flavor of alcohol and there is an odd bitterness and spice character. This could be from the barrels I suppose. I'm not a sake fan and this beer tastes nothing like sake. I'm not sure how well it picked up the flavors of the barrel. I am currently unsure which of their beers to compare it to. Oh well. Mouthfeel is a little odd, not much connectivity and the beer is really thin. Drinkability is OK. The beer gets better and the spice and bitterness makes more sense when the beer approaches room temperature. Wasn't my favorite."
"D: I very interesting beer that blends several elements to create it. I would be hard pressed to seek a lot of this out often, but a great chance to knock another beer from Kiuchi down. I typically reach for their witbier."
"D: Good. I really liked this one a lot. I served it alongside sukiyaki and worked very well. From my perspective, the sake is quite noticeable, but not overpowering, as the malt balances it out well. Interesting, playful, and complex."
"Drinkability also suffers. Just too eclectic, if it's even an intentional thing. Not impressed with the execution, but the idea still has merit."
"Drinkablity: A decent brew, but not the standout that I had hoped for."
"yet another intriguing Japanese micro brew, I'm so stoked that there's several more hitting the shelves here in Alberta that I've yet to try. not sure why I gave Japan so little credit when it comes to craft beer cause from what I've seen so far I would say I got a lot of drinking ahead of me, quality drinking"
"D: An interesting beer, not a must go out and buy, but worth a chance for something different."
"An interesting idea. I haven't tried it in a bottle, but those who did might want to give it a try on tap."
"Gushed out of the bottle and poured murkey and over carbonated. Smells of oxidized alcohols and acetic taint. On first wiff I thought it might be a wild/sour ale, but I think it was just a contaminated attempt of a cool concept. It tastes of oxidized malt, bitterness and sour contamination. The sourness really clashes with the bitterness and nothing about the beer comes off well. I like the sake flavor in there but I can't get past all the flaws. I'm bummed. I was really looking forward to this beer. I think a sake beer could be done really well, but this one is a dumper."
"sake sake sake. bit funky birdsnesty flavor. Poured uber extra foamy with an off white head and a load of lace. Color is medium dark amber. Aroma is heavy yeasty malty vineous. Flavor is a bit boozy, heavy on mustiness, yeast, funk, earthy, Maybe some of this is from the sake. Never had sake out of the cask, can only imagine. Big beer. Good body and great carbonation. Strong finish."
"This is a very unique beer from Hitachino and one that I'm quite impressed with. It's a solid Belgian style beer with the added complexity of a sake barrel character that brings something original to the table."
"O: Good, but not great. Worth a try."
"Drinkability: This is a very good sipping beer!"
"Oaky barrel wood is pretty pronounced in the flavor, as well as some rotting logs from what seems to me to be brett. Burnt, crusty malts provide a nice backdrop for the heavy dose of alcohol and citric bittering hops. Tastes like a bit of the floral, tangy sake residue has found it's way into the beer along with some brown sugared figs. This is one of the most unique beers I have ever had and the first Hitichino 12 ounce bottle that I dont mind shelling out the 5 bucks for. I feel like this could age quite well and I will be picking up a couple for the cellar next time I see it."
"D: Over all I think this is a very pleasant beer. A good change of pace and a great beer to explore. There is a lot going on in this one, and it's one of a kind."
"Overall, a nice and interesting brew, but this would be a rarity in terms of flavor for me in the future."
"D- Great beer, the high alcohol and beer style probably wouldn't make for a session, but I would definitely have a second! American strong does not do this beer justice."
"This is a nicely balanced beer, providing a unique addition to the craft beer scene. I find it a very pleasant beer, even to one who is not a keen sake drinker. I will definitely consider this in food pairings. Seems higher in alcohol than the 7 percent advertised, but maybe that is due to the association of sake and higher alcohol."
"mouthfeel is fullbodied. drinkability is below average."
"now i must admit that my sake expertise is very limited. in fact, to refer to it as such is downright dishonest. my experience with sake was nasty and this is tasty so i suspect that there is no sake here. there is a sharpness that i am used to attributing to brett, which i suppose could have an entirely different source--sake?"
"Drinkability: I would have this again but only one."
"Clearly not an everyday beer, here's another beer for sipping, contemplating, sharing. Highly flavorful, unique and strong, I can't imagine wanting another soon after throwing one down."
"Drinkability - Classifying this as an ""American Strong Ale"" leaves a lot of room for variety and also HUGE competition. Think about the others in this category: Angel's Share, SA Utopia, Stone Brewing offerings. In my opinion, this is the ""hidden gem"" in this vast category. As mentioned above, this is my third Hitachio offering, and I have YET to be able to understand the construction of these beers. What I do know, is that they are outstanding, well-constructed and defy style classification. This one is a nice sipper, the white is a great ""summer beer"" with great complexity, and the ""classic"" is an outstanding standard by by which to measure them all. Well done all around."
"Be cautious when obtaining their beers in Los Angeles."
"While it seems like I like this beer better than some other reviewers, it still wasnt my favorite. I've never tried a beer from this brewery before and this one finally intrigued me enough to get it. Pours a hazy amber with off-white head. Good retention and little lacing. A pretty good looking beer. Smell was very sweet and sugary, some caramel and noticable alochol. A bit of ""cask"" smell to it (some old wood, musty). Taste was of a caramel sweet malt with some straw and grain. A lot of ""earth"" tastes I thought. Not your typical bitter or citrusy hops. I thought there was defintely a saki presence in the taste though I should say I havent drank a lot of saki. The alcohol was noticeable. Mouthfeel was light, somewhat warming as it goes down...relatively crisp. Overall a good beer. I'm reviewing this around the average range because I cant really tell how much I liked it. There are certain qualities I liked, certain ones I didnt."
"D: On the whole, a drinkable beer, though it doesn't necessarily match up with the style 100%."
"This poured a hazy copper with lots of tan head. It smelled like chardonnay, lemon and tart apricot hops, and sour yeast, with a bit of oak and spices. It tasted like white wine, lemon, and apples with sour yeast and spices. It was watery with lots of carbonation, and had a tart aftertaste. Overall this was a very strange tasting beer with lots of subtle spices that I couldn't decipher. It didn't taste bad, but it wasn't really a flavor that I enjoyed either. It didn't have a very good body either, and the sourness / tartness made it not really easy to drink. This was interesting to try once, but I wasn't a big fan."
"This is definitely an interesting sipper. The main source of taste and scent in this beer is the sake, very well rounded, seemingly more alcohol present than the abv. Delicate floral notes mix well with some oak and alcohol. Initial pour is pretty, the head faded a bit too quickly. Overall, an incredibly interesting beer, worth a try without doubt. This brewery has impressed me twice thus far."
"M - Medium bodied, decent carbonation, nothing special."
"Pours a nice dark copper color with huge amounts of foamy head, and a bit of nice lacing. Very strong cask aroma, huge overtones of sweet sake and sweet malt make for a very sweet scent. Interesting flavor, very sweet with a slight tinge of alcohol from the cask; noticable malt and hop characteristics, well blended to the point of not making much out over the sake. Goes down fine, except for a slight burn on the tongue and alcohol kick. Huge sake aftertaste as well."
"XH is not that bad, but you have to love sake to love this beer. And I don't love sake, so there you go. Aw hell, I couldn't come to a conclusion as to whether I liked it or not, but I do know I like elements of it, and I greatly respect its complexity. Most definitely worth a shot, as there's no other beer like it on the planet, to my knowledge."
"Probably only one bottle per sitting for this strong, but really well crafted beer."
"XH is one crazy unique brew from Hitachino. This is obviously my first sake aged beer and it made a good impression. I'd recommend this to friends. Pick it up if you see it around people, it's worth a try."
"This is a very interesting beer, the sake cask aging definitely adds a distinct, interesting signature to this beer. The base beer easily stands up to this though, and the two combine to form a pretty well integrated, interesting whole that is likely greater than the just the sum of the two spirits."
"I definitely think that sake barrel aging is cool though."
"Poured slightly heady with a very cloudly light brown color. The smell is not good at all. liquor with yeast. Reading other reviews that claim to get oak flavors, I'm getting nothing like that. The closest example I have of this is when I tried to drink a room temperature brooklyn monster ale. Has way more of an alcohol taste than I prefer, likely as a result of the sake casks. All I have to say is that for most beers, tasting of rice and liquor isn't a ringing endorsement. I'll take a scotch or bourbon aged beer anyday. Sake casks are a mistake."
"d: interesting and easily approachable beer i'd like to try again"
"A bit strange with the funkiness, but an interesting experience."
"Hitachino Nest XH is surprisingly good beer. A little odd, but I like it. The strong oak flavor gives it a little bit of a weird flavor that keeps it from reaching the elite level, but the flavor is overall nice and well-done. Dialing down the carbonation a little would be beneficial. Other than that, it's a solid, impressive beer. Definitely recommended."
"11.2 ounce bottle. Served in a snifter, the beer pours (after a slight gushing after popping the cap) a cloudy orange/copper color with a half inch off-white head. Head retention is good, lacing is decent. It smells like sour/tart fruit along with some brown sugar, funk and oak. However, the taste isn't sour at all which is a bit disappointing. It tastes like grain, fruit, yeast, brown sugar and some oak. Mouthfeel/body is medium with high carbonation. Drinkability is decent, but it has a bit too much carbonation for my liking. I think it's a decent enough brew, but it's something I wouldn't pick up very often. With that being said, it's definitely worth a try."
"Mouth is a little thin and dry, some definite woodiness going on. This one would be better on a hot afternoon I think."
"The drink is fullish in body, smooth, rich, and creamy, with a sizzle of fine carbonation that helps keep it light and pretty drinkable."
"Drinkability- Not one I'll pick up again, as the strong phenolic flavor is one I don't particularly care for. I love sake, and the idea was an intriguing one. Unfortunately sake flavor was not present, as far as I could tell."
"j."
"Tastes slightly sour, enough to be pleasant to someone who isn't entirely fond of such a style, definitely get the rice and the smooth sake-like mouthfeel, well hidden alcohol, very little oak if any, very light on the typical beer (barley & hop) flavors. Final thoughts are, sour and smooth and somehow well balanced on the atypical qualities it does have."
"Completely forgettable. Even if I was desperate for a sour, I'd avoid this."
"Overall, interesting is a good description, leaves a vague bitter/sourness on the pallet, as with most hitachino it leaves me needing to buy another bottle and try it again."
"Overall, a fantastic beer. Very familiar yet unique if that makes any sense. One of my favorites from the tasting."
"I would find this very drinkable if it wasn't so damn expensive (4.75 for a 12 oz bottle)"
"Its alive!...A spooky beer. Thick retaining head; the yeast topping off the pillow is amber brown, creating lil Mars mountains. Dark, blood orange body with microscopic carbonation cutting through the cloud. Smells like horseshoe, with the horse's foot still nailed to it. The acidity cuts through the senses. Complex on the taste; an array of flavors, hitting note after note. Dark cherry, plum, raisin, sharp tangy tangerine, bitter funky orange. Tastes much better after it breathes. Streaky lacing and a trip to the petting zoo, what more could I ask for?"
"D: Goes down pretty easy; hard part is mustering the desire for any more. ABV actually feels stronger than 7%. Not a bad beer, but not at all worth the price either. Sake aging was worth a try, just not a repeat (from me anyway)."
"Drinkability: I might buy it again sometime but wouldn't drink it often."
"Poured from an 11.2oz bottle and served in a tulip. This beer poured a dark, glowing orange/amber with a solid haze and a thick head of foamy, light tan bubbles. Excellent retention and lacing. The aroma included crisp fresh citrus, sour cherries, lightly toasted oak, and a moderate amount of funkiness. Very inviting. The flavor didn't quite pop like the aroma, but it was still very nice. Notes of subdued caramel, citrus, sour pited fruits, followed up by an unexpectedly hoppy finish. Slightly woody and quite dry. The mouthfeel was medium-bodied and had crisp, assertive carbonation. This was a pleasent surprise. Very enjoyable."
"D: Pretty drinkable."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a bite form the carbonation."
"Overall this was a good introduction to this brewery. This beer is very interesting, and I'm looking forward to delving further into their lineup. Try this one if you see it around."
"Drinkability's medium. It's a sipper for sure. But I wouldn't turn down another ..."
"I've always liked this brewer's beers partly because so many of them are so unusual and well made. This is no exception, at least as far as interesting goes. The one problem I have with this beer is that it was a gusher upon opening and had a slight sourness to it as well. Now, this is often the sign of an infection, but in this case I'm just not sure. This beer was aged in Shochu casks after all, and I think that the beer picked up some bugs from the cask instead, and in this case it isn't a bad thing- the taste is mild and goes with the overall flavor, so I'll assume the best. After the gushing this beer pours a hazy orange with some suspended sediment and a nice head that settles to a finely beaded thin cap. Smells a bit sour with cedar notes and some plummy fruitiness. The taste is complex with some of that sourness up front, then some of that same fruitiness, and a long, funky cedary flavor. Definitely a bit phenolic. Long, spicy mouthfeel with a bit of phenolic tang in the mouth. It's interesting, but a bit hard to drink. I keep wondering if this is intentional or not."
"first from this brewery for me. My brother is a big fan of their and if this is any indication I need to try some more of their offerings."
"Drinkability: Definitely one of the more interesting beers I have tried, with a flavor profile that is all over the palate; a little more carbonation would be a plus but this is an otherwise extraordinary beer"
"Hitachino Nest XH (Matured in Shocyu Sake Casks) pours a hazy dark orange-brown color with a tan head from a brown 11.2 ounce bottle. The aroma is interesting, a bit of clove, some funk, some wood. The mouthfeel is on the thin side. The flavor is, well, different. Wood strikes me first, a good dose of funk comes next and there is a bit of caramel mixed in too. Unique and interesting. It didn't blow me away, but it's quite decent."
"This is a distinctive brew, unlike anything I have tasted before. Different isn't necessarily better, but in this case it works okay."
"Interesting and different type of beer. The appearance is an attractive color of orange, hazy, witha strong off-white head. The aroma is very unique; I sense something akin to a sour ale, but I get unmistakable sake, and oak. The flavor is of rice, sake, a little sour. The wood comes through in this as well. The mouthfeel is a little thick and oily. The finish is a bit sour, with a mild hop bite. fairly clean finish. This is a unique and enjoyable beer. I wouldn't make it a staple, but I enjoyed trying it."
"This beer need more kick to it to compete with awsome woody sake notes. Need more body.Flavors did not blend well to me."
"Notes: This is a better beer than my scores suggest. Definitely one of the more interesting beers I've had in recent memory, wonderfully unique"
"D: It is at least interesting. I would not have two in a row, and probably would not buy another one again considering the crazy price tag, but I would recommend that given the chance, you should try this once, especially if you like Flanders Oud Bruin."
"Kiuchi beer is expensive (this bottle was $4.79), but if you pick and choose carefully, it's worth it. Hitachino Nest XH is outstanding beer for a whole host of reasons: it tastes like nothing else, it's captivatingly complex, it's decidedly delicious, and its dangerously drinkable. Two thumbs up."
"D - An interesting beer that unfortunately never really comes together for me. Appearance was outstanding, but the taste didn't live up to that high precedent. Probably my least favorite offering from an otherwise outstanding brewery."
"Very nice... different, but nice. Not one I could sit and drink repeatedly."
"This beer pours a deep, slightly hazy amber with a thick, lasting, creamy head. It has a nice sour aroma and flavor that is balanced with a little underlying sweetness in the body of the beer. There are some woody notes followed by a balanced finish. Tasty. I'll definitely get this one again."
"Pours a murky reddish color, not unlike the color of some barleywines I've had. Nice foamy tan head settles quickly into a sudsy collar around the glass. Some definite sourness in the nose, fruity & yeasty, and a slightly eye-watering alcohol smell. Taste is softer than the nose would imply, some oaky flavors, slight tartness, some bitter green apple skin. Nice thick mouthfeel on this one, even though the ABV isn't raging high, it's still a slow sipper. All in all, a very interesting brew, but not something I'd actively seek out on any kind of regular basis."
"interesting, but not necessarily all positive. ""american strong ale"" is certainly a broad category, so it's not so out of place here."
"Bottle: Poured a deep cloudy dirty beige color ale with a large foamy head with good retention and some good lacing. Aroma consists of a sweet barley malt base with some distinctive notes of light sake. Taste is also dominated by a barley wine type taste of sweet malt with some distinctive notes of rice and sake, which I must admit are quite pleasant. Full body with some great carbonation and no apparent alcohol. Another winner beer from a great brewery."
"pours up an orange-amber color with an orange tinted cream colored head. the nose is strange like a fungus (among us). smells like Brettanomyces! destroyer of worlds! j/k... slight sourness. smells of candy sugar in a sour ale. the taste is sweet with a dry finish, full bodied. funky but good brew. could this be a Wild Ale? the world may never know...."
"enjoyed at the second Stumelagram tasting ... a weird fruity bretty aroma ... quite sour bite, with a strong bitterness ... combined with a strange steel drum sweetness .... good lacing ... crazy stuff ... enjoyable and a bit insane ... a good brew to share with a couple of people, a whole bottle could be to much.."
"D: only one of these for me. I enjoyed the uniqueness of it but one is all I can do."
"Pours a hazy copper/ orange-ish color, with a tan head. In the aroma, sake aromas, touch salty and smokey, hints of cinnamon, and mostly tart. In the taste, tart green apples and a small presence of cinnamon. A spice bite, medium mouthfeel, and a dry, tart green apple aftertaste. Not expecting the tartness at all, but good flavor and aroma, a really interesting, good beer."
"Orange colour and bubbly head, floral aromas. A different culture and a different measure of what bitterness is. A definite woodiness, without too much of supporting flavours other than alcohol and a bitterness from the ale itself. I do not believe it was greatly drinkable, by different standards it is a successful ageing/barreling."
"I'd try it again, but only if I was sure of it's freshness, alot of stufflike this gets too old."
"Overall Impression: Once again I'm nothing but impressed by Hitachino. This beer is anything but conventional, but boy is it good."
"D : Not being a fan of sake, it's probably one I would skip. It's not bad, just not my style."
"D-went down with ease. if you like sake even a little bit you should check this one out. id drink another one if i was offered it, but i feel it was a little expensive to want to buy it again."
"Rock on Kiuchi!"
"D: Yeah, I would love to get my hands on a few more bottles."
"Short and stubby 11.2oz bottle. Pours a magnificent orangish amber color with an off-white head that leaves a solid coat of lacing all over the glass, even after consuming the entire beer. The sweet floral aroma is very aromatic with a good amount of oak, and sour cherries. The taste is slightly funky with some oak and a very dry and slightly spicy hopped finish. Wow, I am very surprised with this one. It is a very beautiful pours and is complex in both the aroma and taste with the flavors meshing extremely well. The mouthfeel has a really nice smooth feel to it with a perfect amount of carbonation. Overall, they really did it right with this brew. It is a little on the pricey side, but it is well worth it. I will have to pick up a couple more bottles of this. Recommended."
"Pours out an amber color with a nice, tan, fluffy head. The smell is heavily of citrus and bitter fruits and sake, with a touch of oak. The taste is strongly influenced by sake and the sake casks...it's actually a little overwhelming. Fruits also make an appearance. This brew has some very interesting qualities...some are good, but they are a bit too overpowering. Nice to try though."
"Complex nose of sweet fruits and funk. Awfully aromatic. Dark orange color, with a huge and lasting foam. Unique tartness with exotic fruits and interesting flavors. Really nice and delectable, bottle conditioned ale. Hitachino Nest is quite a brewery."
"This is surprisingly good.. Enjoyed this throughout.."
"Note: Had occasion to revisit this beer again at Pizza Paradiso in DC the other day. While every bit as wonderful, the stuff I had in DC had an interesting sour, funky component that I don't recall this beer had when I had it in Seattle. Regardless. This is an exceptional beer, though my guess is there probably is some variation from keg to keg."
"I was excited that this beer made it's way to America and I picked up a bottle as soon as I could and tried it right away. I shared it with a friend who really likes shouchu so I was looking forward to her reaction to it as well. It poured a golden yellow with a thick white head. I noted some floral notes to it as well as some spice and a bit of the shouchu which I was really looking for. It's a bit dry with tight, gentle carbonation. A nice beer to savor."
"D:Definitely worth a try."
"I like trying diffrent/unique beers. Overall I would pick up another every now and again."
"Was this bottle ruined? I may never know; the first one traumatized me too much to buy another (not to mention it's overpriced at >$5 for around 10oz)."
"Drinkability: The bitter harshness pulls through too much for me. Not my favorite but worth a taste. Certainly seems stronger than 7.00% ABV!"
"Poured into an oversized wine glass producing a good two fingers worth of tan head with lots of lacing and looked mahogany in color. Peculiar smell to it almost like green olives. Tasted a little sour up front with hints of green olives and finished with a dry and bitter taste in the mouth. I thought this was a lot better than their milk stout but still a little too funky for me. I don't think I would try this one again."
"Im a big fan of sake, so i really enjoyed this beer. Very unique flavors in this one. I will probably try and pick up a few bottles if i get the chance."
"This one poured a hazy deep amber colour. The cream coloured head settled quickly to a long-lasting collar with a skim of fine bubbles, which produced some sticky and spotty lacing. Red wine and fruit in the aroma, along with wood, earthiness, and a hint of grass. Ripe fruit flavour, mild bitterness, with definite wood character and a bit of booze towards the finish. Medium bodied with moderate carbonation, slightly dry. Very nice. Quite an interesting flavour combination and the sake casks are a nice change of pace in the wood aging department."
"Not sure why this is called an ""American"" Strong Ale since it's wholly a product of Japan."
"D - Drinkability is good. This is different but Kiuchi was able to keep it quite interesting from start to finish. Once it warms the balance of sour and sweet only gets better. I would recommend giving it a try."
"I don't think I'd pick this up again, but it's pretty interesting."
"Pretty unique overall. Yeast, wood, sweetness...my first Hitachino beer and its a good one."
"The merging of fermented rice essence with a solid malt profile leads to a nicely blended, highly original presentation. This is why we try new things. The ABV is warmer and more open than expected, but then, it's not designed to be a session brew, so it doesn't suffer. Maybe it's not quite eXHilarating, but it is an eye-opener and well worth enjoying to the bottom of the glass."
"This is a very unique tasting strong ale and definitely takes some getting used to. I definitely recommend this beer as a must-try."
"Pours a clear ruby hued brown. Crème head. Nose is thick with wood and it almost seems like cherries? There's definitely an odd fruit edge to it. Flavor is amazing, but mysterious. Clearly the cask aging has provided a depth of character that the western palate might not be able to fully comprehend and fully appreciate. Excellent carbonation and a smooth liquid feel. This is one of the most oddball beers I have ever had and I love it. Every beer lover needs to give this a shot at least once."
"Drinkability: I paid $5 for the bottle, but Hitachino stuff's always worth it to me. They seem to be one of the most underrated breweries doing great experiments. I imagine if DFH did a beer like this (and please do, DFH) everyone would be all over it, but Hitachino doesn't get the hype. Still, an amazing and crazy brewery that doesn't skimp in the experimentation (or the price, clearly). I may pick another one of these up and see how it ages, because I imagine the yeast and bottle conditioning could do some great things. But an overall singular beer and a great experience, one I'd recommend highly, especially if this really is a one-time thing..."
"Quite interesting."
"Drinkability: I can assure you that it is interesting, but I keep going back and forth on whether or not I actually enjoyed it..."
"D- I loved this beer. I could drink a few of these. Enjoyed this with my dinner and could not help but want another one."
"Very unique...very unusual."
"Another nice one from the creative brewers at Hitachino. Similar to sour Belgians, but has unique qualities that definitely make it worth a try."
"Bold flavor profile, quite unlike any beer I've tasted, except for Hitachino's Red Rice Ale. Like RRA, XH packs some tart citrus, spice, and hops into its brew. A big carbonation level leaves me thinking that I'm sipping on some type of alcoholic, grapefruit soda (Squirt & Sake??). The alcohol feels stronger, here, even though it's only 7% to RRA's 8.5%. Carbonation is high, and the mouthfeel is sticky and crisp. Some chewy malts pull through as it warms. Overall, I enjoyed this more than the other Hitachino's I've tried, but it's still a taste that I can't quite get used to."
"Drinkability - I'm enjoying the education with this one though I don't think I'd drink this much. Maybe the oaky flavor would pair up with some smoky 'cue, but price and availability are a hindrance. Oh well, it was a worthwhile experience."
"Even thought I've been to Japan and have a bottle in the fridge, I have never had sake before, so I can't really comment on the aspects in this brew. But this one has some very interesting qualities. During the first few sips, I thought I was going to give it slightly lower marks. The funky, tartness of it were unexpected but it really started to become more pleasing the more I had."
"Interesting stuff, and if you're in the mood for a different type of experience, this one is worth a shot..."
"The best Hitachino brew I've had yet. This one has a smell that'll push your boundaries for how you describe beers. The actual taste has some off notes that are a bit overpowering, unfortunately. Still, this is worth grabbing since it's so limited, and I imagine a year in the cellar might do wonders for the hurricane of concepts that attack you when you sample this one."
"Herbal hop presence up front. Acidic, slightly citrusy (grapefruit), and tart funkiness set against barely sweet fruits. Vinous, slightly vinegary, with definite cedar/wood presence. Tart and sweet fruits with vague bitterness in the finish. Low-key carbonation with a creamy feel. An interesting and well-conceived beer."
"D- A decent sour/tart beer, nicely balanced with solid aromas, alcohol is well-masked, easy-drinking"
"Overall, a strange beer, but a decent american strong ale. A thought of arrogant bastard, a little old foghorn, and some japanese lager (to lighten it up) is sitting in my glass. It's a hard beer to review as i get a good amount of flavors that gives the beer a complexity, but not sure how much i like the beer. I dont dislike this beer, but i do not think i will ever get it again."
"I highly recommend this one."
"I wouldn't particularly recommend this beer."
"It works for me but I would imagine a lot of people will be put off by the sour/wild flavors."
"Mouthfeel-The first wave is that of a strong ale. Not much hop profile there at all. It has been a long time since I even tried sake. I do get flavors of whisky. There is a complex bitterness that is obviously the sake and the barrel. It is not a bad flavor, and I have never been fortunate to have any barrel or sour/funky beer styles. This would be good as an after dinner long-sipper. I appreciated this one and I like Hitachino's offerings. I might have given a higher drinkability, but my palate was so new to this one. Definitely worth trying, but hard to describe."
"I couldn't drink this regularly, but I would say this is one of the superior versions of strong ale."
"An interesting beer that is strongly reminiscent of an Oud Bruin in my opinion. In fact, had I tasted this blind, I'm almost certain that's the style I'd have assigned it. I'm not very familiar with sake, so I don't know how much the flavor was influenced by the sake cask aging. It's well worth the try, especially for fans of slightly sour beers. Recommended."
"Interesting to say the least! This is probably one of the most unique beers on earth, and probably worth trying for that reason alone, although I enjoyed it immensely when consumed slowly, one sip at a time. I think it wouldd make a great beer to enjoy while reading a good book, or watching a movie, but I'd avoid it at the bar. Take a bottle home and savor it slowly."
"What a weird beer. It's unique and tasty, but not terribly drinkable. In sum, it's a tough beer to describe and one you should experience personally."
"D- The wood and fusel alcohol heat really comes through this beer but the malt flavors are strong enough to stand up to them. The sake flavor really doesn't work with the malt flavors."
"I enjoyed the experience of this beer though I can't see myself drinking it too often"
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- The slick, rolling texture is surprisingly good here... again, ""creamy"" does it justice in more ways than one. Still a bit hot for me personally, but this is a nice sipping beer that stands apart from all other strong ales as far as I'm concerned."
"D_this almost drinks like an oak aged double ipa. Nicely done"
"Man what a different beer. At first my thoughts were ""what the hell is this"" and now they are ""this is some good shit"". Thick buttered toffee mid palate with multiple fruit rushes from all angles. Tannin from the barrel is present in the early finish and dies out quickly. Dates and more buttery aspects but not diacetyl. Rotten pear and some old red apple flavor almost even cideresque. Mouth is slightly thin and silky but fits the beer nicely. So odd yet I could drink a couple on a cool fall evening."
"I'm not exactly sure what aging this beer in sake casks gave to the overall flavors but it is a nice strong ale. I think the initial taste and the aftertaste are quite nice."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a sweet, plum-wine finish."
"Poured from a squat fattie ($3.50 at Whole Foods) into a tumbler. The beer was dark copper colored and murky, with tons of yeastie floaters. The smell is robust with alcohol and a little sourness, not really the sake flavor I half expected (and I've tried a crapload of sake in my several short visits to Japan). The taste is very rich, malty and bitter and a little unique in the beer world. Almost Belgian-esque, a little sour with hints of cherries or plums. The mouthfeel is full even though there isn't a great deal of carbonation. A little too strongly bitter aftertaste for me to rate drinkability too high."
"Pours a dirty auburn brown body with a small beige head that quickly falls to a cap. Some rings of lace aound the snifter. Aroma of wood, sake, and fried rice. Mouthfeel is nice, medium body and crisp carbonation. Taste is better than the aroma with prominent oak wood tones and a faint note of berries. As it warms, the sake becomes dominant imparting some harsh alcohol which lasts into the finish. Not my favorite Hitachino Nest but one of the most interesting."
"DISCLAIMER: It's not often that I'll review a beer tasted at a Festival, but I'll make a handful of exceptions from the past weekend's Portland International Beerfest. This came from a 33cl bottle, chilled on ice and poured to a clear (plastic) 4 oz. tasting glass. As this was my wife's first pour on Saturday (which I wound up drinking most of...) and my first on Sunday (from 1 of 2 bottles set aside by the event organizers and sampled well after the rest of the limited stock had run out - thank you very much, Chris!), I started with a clean glass and palate both times, so I have no problem writing a 'proper' review."
"Cheers"
"Drinkability: Easy to drink and pleasant to savor despite its sweetness and ABV. Another winsome ale from Kiuchi."
"ABV can creep up on you in this one, easy to drink with its medium body and well masked alcohol. Overall drinkability good, though the strong bitterness might throw some off. Definitely recommended for a try."
"This ale poured a hazy golden amber color with white foam that settled and left a coat. The smell was a strong, ""chewy", citrusy floral hops aroma - very nice. The taste was dominated by floral hops but with a good bit of malt sweetness to balance, and with some grapefruit (hops), caramel, and molasses in the mix. There was a pleasant hop bitterness in the finish. The mouthfeel was dominated by the hops, with a little sharpness and dryness on the tongue. The body was medium full and the carbonation moderate. This was quite a suprisingly good ale bursting with hops."
"Same as above, but the alcohol is just overpowering. Can bearly drink it."
