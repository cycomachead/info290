"Medium bodied. Gotta sip this one. Pretty decent carbonation."

"Overall: Tastes like sweet sweet malts, caramel, slight alcohol tinge and burn, medium finish, pleasant, medium bodied. A really unique, delicious and excellent beer."

"Very good strong heavy bodied flavoursome beer"

"I prefer the 9000 version of the beer which is slightly more boozy in flavor (and reality). But this is a solid second."
"O-  This stuff is awesome."
"Poured two fingers light brown sudsy head, excellent retention and sticky lacing. Dark orange and brown, with some amber shining through. Quite clear, minimal clouding. Smells of raisins, brown sugar and sweet malt. Notes of other dark fruits like plum and cherries. Aromatics have a lot to say, and loudly. Upon tasting, higher alcohol content is apparent, but well disguised behind a menagerie of bold flavors, matching aromatics. Brown sugar is apparent up front, followed by a lingering aftertaste of the dark fruits. Wonderful mouth feel, chewy, syrupy, foams up on the tongue, but not overwhelming in terms of acidity or carbonation. An incredible balance. Flavor lingers on front of tongue for several minutes. What an amazing beer. I picked up a 750 for $13, not the best price I've found it at, but well worth it for such a spectacular treat. Very highly recommended. Even my burps are delectable."
"On tap at Belgian Beer Cafe - NYC."
"Gulden Draak is a one-of-a-kind Belgian. You can tell upon inspection that it's going to be rich and imposing. The beer pours a surprisingly dark, turbid shade of molasses. The aroma is somewhere between caramel and dulce de leche with some earthy notes, maybe raisins and cloves. It has the familiar sweet lace of all tripels with some well-balanced savory malts. The combination produces a boozey mouthfeel like a fortified wine or grappa. It's a strong, unique beer."

"Top notch world-class beer that is a real treat to sip on!"
""
""
""
""
"A superlative brew and one I'd keep on hand at all times. Unique, yet meets one's expectations and thus provides a certain comfort."
""
""
"Bottle of Gulden draak drank."
""

"Overall: I usually prefer lighter brews, but this one is smooth, delicious and dangerously drinkable."

"carmelized ripe banana, full bodied"

"Caramel, brown sugar, and malt. Terrific Belgian."
""
""
"This beer is just like one of my favorite beers! This is rich and creamy and also has a nice strong bitterness, but not overwhelmingly so. This beer also has a high alcohol content that is not at all apparent when drinking it. The smoothness of this beer is incredible, but finding this beer is quite difficult."
""
""
""
"Smokey, Raisins, Prunes, Hides the 10.5 ABV very well"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"How this is classified as a tripel is beyond me. This brew is awesome, but it's more like a quad. Very sweet, but not cloying. It pours with probably the biggest head I have ever seen on a beer. Complex taste of spices and honey. Simultaneously crisp and creamy mouthfeel. I don't drink Belgians all that much anymore, but this beer kicks ass!"
""
""
""
"Very smooth almost sweet enjoyable. When poured huge head of foam died down after a few minutes but nice layer of foam lingered a while.I would have again."
""
"Amber to brown colour, with an off white medium head that leaves a good lace. Smell of spices, dark fruits, chocolate, hints of red wine, candy, prunes. Medium body, I expected some more, Alcohol is there, but does not seem that much. Taste of prunes, banana, dark fruits, chocolate, hints of red wine to. Classic. And cool bottle, label, and cap."
""
""
""
""
"first dark triple i've had in a long time. great"
""
"It's a little too strong for my taste."
"I absolutely love everything about the look of this beer. From the iconic white bottle, ominous red letters and legendary dragon ship, it promises to be a bad ass experience. Very medeval. The appearance of the beer itself is equally impressive. Like rich, raw maple syrup in color. It poured in to a small snifter with a towering head of loose foam. The beige 3 finger crown resembled swiss cheese, with its loose, large bubbles of varying size and consistency. The beautiful and unique cap settled gradually, leaving soapy residual lacing on the glass. The nose on this beer is incredibly complex. As the beer reached room temperature more and more layers of aroma continued to present themselves. Toffee, burnt caramel, banana esters and slight booze come together in such a wonderful way as to conjure thoughts of bananas foster. Slight mineral notes and clover honey add even more depth to the bouquet. The taste is brimming with candy sugar sweetness and a little fusel alcohol heat. Sweet candied fruits, dried banana chips and a honey crisp character yield to a tart, tangy finish of mild puckering green apple. A peppery spice from the alcohol compliments the assortment of flavors. The finish imparts a slight suggestion of pumpernickel & caraway seed. Extremely complex. As I sample each sip, I believe I could continue to pull additional flavors and aromas out of the experience. Remarkable. The mouthfeel has a lively, creamy texture. Rich and inviting. You just gotta love the big authentic Belgians. They're just so full of character and complexity. A+"

"Excellent beer.. The deal,,,, delicious strong and like drinking a barley wine!"

"Overall I give it a 92. im actually surprised by how massive yet inoffensive this was. glad I picked up this bottle of Gulden Draak. Very pleased. Hope to revisit this beer (and style) again sometime in the near future."
"Not a fan of this flavour, but can appreciate the brew"
""
""
""
"It's a boozey beer, a bit too boozey. The 9000 has all the good qualities of this beer without the heavy sweetness."
""
"Flavorful and balanced well against the sweet. Great dark Belgium"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Smooth"
""
""
"This beer is one of my favorites.  Its a dark color for a triple and it smells great.  The flavor is bolder than most triples and that's why I like it so much.  Get it, if you can."
""
"Packs a real punch, but the high ABV (10.5%! Whew! Dragon indeed) is reasonably hidden. I've heard this one called a barely wine, but I wonder if that label was thrown out there just do to the ABV. This one is a legend in any case, and I'm glad to have tried it. Will definitely come back to ride the dragon again sometime."

"Final Grade: 4.51, an A grade. Gulden Draak is an excellent strong Belgian dark ale that is guaranteed to put some hair on your chest. Rich-flavoured is almost an understatement, as the dark fruit and sugary, boozy flavours make this feel like a dessert in and of itself. Easily one of the better examples of this style that I have tried - worth seeking out, worth the price, and any Belgian dark ale fan worth his or her salt should consider this one a must-try."

"Of the three (this, 9000,Piraat), I liked this one the best.  Each had its own unique strong points and none were the same, which is funny considering there were so many similarities amongst them.  I gave them a the full calculated range between 3.75 and 4, but I think they all fall into a certain flavor profile that is common to the brewer (which itself is not uncommon).  I would have any again, but this exercise, on this day, showed me this one was slightly better."

"Intense taste of malt, sugar and lots of alcohol, ending with a bitter alcoholic finish, which warms up the belly. Perfect beer for a cold winter night, spices add a decent complexity. I recommend todrink this nearly at room temperature,lots of tastes get noticable while the beer warms up, taste becomes more balanced. Carbonation supports the taste very well, helps to not make this too heavy."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Enjoy!!"
""
"This is one of the best beers I have had. Sweet taste that dissipates quickly, leaving smooth ever slightly bitter, hops flavors . Carbonation is just right.  having one right now and the bottle just emptied .gg"

"O: Perhaps not my favorite of the style, but a very well done big beer."

"Don't drink at refrigerator temperature - the flavors open up more when the beer is allowed to warm slightly. Overall this is an excellent and very well balanced beer although it's a touch too sweet for me."
"Poured a very dark, nearly opaque brown with a huge head that settled down to a half inch retention. Not much lacing, but that's not surprising considering the alcohol in this beer. The aroma was fantastic, with raisins, toffee and dark fruit notes. The taste is phenomenal, with lots of dark fruit flavors and some malty sweetness and a bit of grape must flavor- simply outstanding! The mouthfeel is creamy and silky smooth, with just a bit of alcohol burn. This is just a great beer!"

"Dark fruity flavours with hints of burnt caramel. Good body on the palette and taste lingers in the mouth. Definitely a favourite!"
""
"Overall – I like it and would recommend it to most people. The flavour is well put together and it goes down very well so it is a good sipping beer for an evening of posting reviews."
"The gold standard of non-Trappist produce tripels, Gulden Draak is an excellent beer. Fruity and earthy, it has an almost pungent flavor that encourages small sips, but rewards the palate with an elaborate, complex flavor. A bit on the pricey side, this is a special purchase, but often worth the price."

"O: Not the prettiest beer, but what an amazing flavor profile! It has a huge earthiness, but still a ice light crisp finish that balances out the big flavors so well. I could really go for a lighter version of this so I could drink more without getting obliterated from tho high 10.5% alcohol."

"Overall I thought this was a decent beer and I thought it was a pretty average example Belgian Strong Dark Ale, the brewery claims this in a dark Tripel, but to me it's just an average Belgian Strong Dark Ale and there isn't anything about it that immediately makes me think of a Tripel. This beer didn't have the best drinkability, it was a little smooth, slightly cloying, a little sticky, fairly crisp, a little filling and the taste didn't do the best job at holding my attention, so I think one bottle would be my limit and even that is a little more than enough, I wouldn't want to have another one in a row. What I like the most about this beer was nothing, there wasn't one single aspect that stuck at as being better than the rest. What I liked the least about this beer was the sweetness and lack of complexity, that seemed to be this beers biggest downfalls. I might buy this beer again if I knew it was fresh, but I'm in no hurry to find a fresh bottle and as it stands now I can't say I would recommend it. All in all I just wasn't too into this beer it seemed a little bland and with the sweetness sticking out the most it didn't really make for the best introduction to a dark Tripel. This isn't my favorite beer from this brewery or my favorite BSDA. Better luck next time guys, this one just wasn't for me."

"Pours the characteristic medium-brown you would expect from this type of beer, and the head never stops growing - it's like a magic trick. Smells of licorice, cherries, and loads of malts. The taste basically follows along, but has amazing complexity with the added alcohol esters. Almost perfect mouthfeel, quite dry, with smooth, bubbly carbonation that just won't give up. This really is a top-notch beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Hazy red colour, rich head. Smell and taste of honey and dark fruits. Very sweet, possibly  one of the sweetest BSDAs I've tried. A bit of acidity when warmed. Similar by sweetness to La Trappe Quadrupel and Urthel Samaranth, which are slightly better. Not bad, but I wouldn't recommend it to someone who wants to discover Belgian strong dark ales."
""
""
""
""
"O: little bit sweet, but not cloy, finishing very dry. nice beer"
"I'll never pass up on the Draak when I see it at a decent price. It's deceivingly smooth and hits all the right notes when I'm in the mood for something sweet, complex, and strong."

"I've never had a beer with such a distinct grapeskin taste. I wonder, given the region this brew stems from, if grapes may indeed have been used as an adjunct to malts. This is a very complex, unique and enjoyable brew, though I wouldn't rate it as highly as some other dark strong Belgians I've tried. A very good but not outstanding beer, considering the cost of the bottle (about 11 bucks)."

"Served on-tap in downtown Janesville, WI. This pours a brown color with a light beige head. Not too much of a scent other than a little malt aroma. There is a sweet, malty flavor that erupts with delicious flavors. A little bit of alcohol burn given the A.B.V. but very well made."

"Not sure if I like it fresh or with age on it, but it still is a classic, even here. This was one of the greats for me when I first started drinking better beer, and revisiting it with age on it was a pleasure indeed. I don't usually drink Belgian beers of this kind anymore, but it works joyfully as a dessert offering even at this point. This is also one of the most recommended offerings to present to people that have a skewed viewpoint on beer. For a monster beer, very drinkable and definitely enjoyable."

"I do not need 250 characters to review this beer. Bla bla Bla bla bla I just like it , i am not a critic to spend 1 hour writing stuff."
"Overall this is an excellent beer. A little pricy when I bought it as a four pack but hey, a Sam Adams at a sports bar would be the same price as one bottle of this at my local craft beer store."
""
""
""
"Picked this one up due to ratings and I tend to very much enjoy big Dark Ales and Quads, so figured this was must try. Outstanding looking and smelling beer, nearly perfect. Taste lives up to billing, extremely tasty. Over 10%, no way, not heavy at all. Big bonus points for drinkability. This one is excellent and one I will buy again despite its cost. Very much worth it."

"O - Gulden Draak is a classic example of big, dark Belgian beer at its finest. Truly one of the best ales ever created and its traditional recipe paired with that Belgian brilliance makes for one hell of a beer. I have at least one of these every year. Most folks will have tasted its greatness before, but for those who haven't I insist you grab a bottle of Gulden Draak and experience this outstanding ale. Forever a world class creation."

"O: A solid beer for sure and much fruitier and sweeter than I'd remembered. Solid complexity though I'd like a bit more substance in the physical body of the beer. I've been spoiled though: this is no Westvleteren."

"Dark brown with reddish hues transparent body below a beautiful white head and lace that sticks to the glass. Smells of malt, creamy and alcoholic. Some herbal spices and pepperiness with some sweet fruit to balance it out. Raisins and bubblegum. Very nice mouthfeel, thickness from the malt. Sweeter and fruitier in the beginning, the warming alcohol and a little bit of hops then break through and the aftertaste is toasty and malty with a little bit of dried fruits. Bready from the malt. Honestly, hard to describe as every with every sip I seem to find new characteristics. A great brew and good treat, ABV definitely noticeable."

"I tried this because of all the good things I've read about it. Even though it's a tripel and ""should be"" lighter, the darker appearance was intriguing. Once I tasted it, I decided that I would always have some of this around; it's just too good to pass-up; maybe even too good to share. Now I know one more place to stop when I eventually take that beer/winery trip to Belgium..."

"Be careful drinking this beer. It will knock your d.kk into the dirt. I had some in California, then met some Hispanics, with whom I naturally drink tequila. Well shooting tequila and chugging the beer two or three times caused me to lose my coat and get a cut over my eye. I haven't drunk it since."

""

"Overall / Drinkability: A definite treat of a beer, worth savoring slowly after a meal, but I think I could pair this with the right meal and/or desert and it would go equally well. Alcohol is dangerously hidden, as I know if I had another one of these I would be in trouble. So one is enough per evening, but it is so tasty I would not mind a bigger glass / bottle to enjoy slowly over an evening."
""

"A Belgian classic, though sweeter than I remember it. Perhaps the age of the bottle has resulted in a touch too much oxidation? Looks decent, with a superbly rich aroma and flavour of dried fruit and booze. Body is OK, though the carbonation could be toned down a tad. An excellent beer, particularly for winter, but one to be savoured at leisure. Add this one to your must-try list."

"Will have again without a doubt; worth clamoring to get ahold of."
""

""

"O: A very intriguing brew. Bottle states that this is a ""dark tripel"" and I kinda agree. It has that high carbonation and big bright fruity crispness of a tripel but with lots of brown sugar and dark bread flavors. It's like a cross between a tripel and a quad. Very unique and very tasty."

"Poured a deep ruby red, semi-opaque, with a one finger off-white head that receded to a white ring rather quickly. While the head was nothing to write home about, the body color was fantastic. Scents of bubblegum, apple, pear, banana, fruity esters of a less describable sort, Belgian yeast, candi sugar and faint hints of alcohol. A good, fruity, yeasty, sweet and complex Belgian aroma. Taste begins with candi sugar, notes of apple and pear and some yeasty dark bread, moves into raisin, prune, sweet bready malts, caramel and some earthy Belgian yeast. Finishes with more bready malt and just a touch of alcohol. Quite nice, rather sweet, but not overly so and very complex. Mouthfeel is medium-heavy bodied, with moderate carbonation, a slight alcohol burn, and a drying finish. Very nice sipping mouthfeel. Overall this is an excellent Belgian Strong Dark. Its got the complexity in both aroma and flavor that defines the style, and a very nice profile to both to boot."

"Other reviews seem centered on bottled examples. I tasted in Middleton Ma at Maggies Farm on draught. Served in a tulip glass and poured with a large head. Unlike bottled reviews, I did not get an expected alcohol nose but rather a sweet malty aroma. In drinking, I found a very well balanced experience and a warming feeling (obviously from the gravity). Overall, one of the top ten brews I've tasted this year."
"Overall - This is a beer that gets straight to the point does not beat around the bush and try to trick you into what it is: a serious and delicious Belgian Strong Dark Ale that is extremely well crafted and will put you on your ass if you don't respect it. Definitely a sipper. Personally one of my two favorites from the style with the Rochefort 8 yet how they achieve their excellence couldn't be more different. A huge recommendation for anyone wanting to try something in the style."
"Very impressive."

"Overall - I really like this beer and I am savoring my bottle, it was well worth the money spent on it. I like the complex layering present in taste, smell and mouthfeel. Once again, a great beer, very European."

"o: Fine follow-up to the St. Bernardus Abt. 12 I had last night. Less persistent flavor, but enough to keep you wanting to taste more. If this was $2 a bottle instead of $5.25, I'd buy it often. Will definitely want to try the 9000 Quad soon."

"O: I love Belgian Strongs and this was a good one. Not with the elite of the bunch, but certainly a great beer worth enjoying when you are in the mood for a Belgian."
"I had it at a bar in Tilburg, The Netherlands. The appearance of the beer was okay, a nice, dark color. The smell was pretty neutral, nothing special. The taste was surprisingly sweet, fruity. But not too sweet like some other beers, the fruity taste was done very well. Overall a good beer."

"Bottle at World of Beer in Tioga. Pours purplish reddish brown with a nice cream colored head. Aroma of plums, booze, and yeast funk. Flavor follows with yeasty bitter on top of sweet dark fruits, raisins, figs, etc. hit me hard as I have not eaten and this drinks pretty easy. Solid Belgian brew."
"I don't think I've ever had a beer this strong that didn't taste or feel it, as the alcohol was extremely well-hidden and almost undetectable at the end of my drinking session. Most beers like this feel strong but this one was an exception and felt more like a Dubbel than a Strong Dark Ale. This may be the best Belgian beer I've ever had and given how many other strong candidates are out there, that's no small feat. A must-try for any aficionado of beer, regardless of stylistic preference."

"Gulden Draak set out to be a dark Belgian Triple, it succeeded. The bright, snappy hoppiness is there, as well as the fruit forward yeast and solid bready malt backbone. Unfortunately, there is also a lot of alcohol phenols in both flavor and aroma that really interferes and covers up the above said qualities as the beer warms in it's glass. This is a decent beginner Belgian beer, but it can't hold its own against the big boys of Belgium."

"750 ml bottle into tulip glass, 8/20/2012 bottle code. Pours lightly cloudy deep ruby red color with a 2 finger dense and fluffy cream colored head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Nice foamy lacing clings on the glass, with a lot of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of big pear, apple, grape, raisin, plum, banana, clove, pepper, dark candi sugar, honey, herbal, toast, brown bread, and yeast earthiness. Fantastic aromas with great balance and big complexity of fruity/spicy esters with moderate malt sweetness; and good strength. Taste of pear, apple, grape, raisin, plum, banana, clove, pepper, herbal, dark candi sugar, honey, toast, brown bread, and yeast earthiness. Lingering notes of light and dark fruits, banana, clove, pepper, dark candi sugar, honey, herbal, toast, brown bread,and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Awesome balance and complexity of fruity/spicy yeast ester flavors; with a moderate dark malt balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a slick, crisp, and moderately prickly mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a fantastic Belgian strong dark ale! Big complexity of fruity/spicy esters with moderate malt balance; and very smooth and crisp to sip on. A highly enjoyable offering."

"*Addendum: To echo the advice of BuckeyeNation, do be sure to incorporate the sediment at the bottom of the bottle into the pour (especially with the bomber). The difference in balance is like night and day. The sweetness is tempered a great deal, thereby making this much more drinkable. I wish I would have known in advance, as my palate is probably pretty well skewed at this point, but the difference is hard to miss nonetheless."

"Overall: Belgian strong dark ales are among my favorite styles of beers, the Gulden Draak is an exceptional example of such a beer. If you like Belgian quads and other strong dark ales, and haven’t tried the Gulden Draak yet, do yourself a favor and pick up a bottle. You won’t be disappointed."

"O: An interesting beer; glad I tried it; very smooth and drinkable at 10.5%."
"O: While this beer is certainly a treat on occasion, there's just something about it that left me overall yearning for more. Maybe it was the hype surrounding it that clouded my judgment? Nevertheless, this beer is a nice change of pace compared to my usual choices. Complexly flavored, full-bodied, smooth brew, and kind of dangerous because it doesn't drink like a strong ale. It's just not something I'd write home about; it straddles the line between good and exceptional, but falls more along the lines of good."

""
""
""
""
""
"I love this brew. It is very malty, and somewhat intense...however in excellent ways. The sweetness and pepperiness combine to give this an all around excellent drink with an alcohol intensity that doesn't give that cheap vodka aftertaste. This is a must get."

"This is one of the funkiest tripels Belgium has produced. Normally tripels have either a clementine, orange, or at least another citrus fruit within the flavor of the beer, but with the golden dragon not a one. This beer caught me off guard and I'm down to try it soon. By the way, This beer goes very well with an Italian sub with heavy mayo and oil"

"Gulden Draak pours a dark brownish color, with a nice large and lacing head. There is a sweet and slightly sour aroma. The taste has a profound sweetness and a slight sourness. Good full flavor, and nice to drink. Overall a very good solid beer, there is a nice fruitiness that is similar to a nice wine."
"Overall – Strong dark fruit flavors with a good balance in warming boozy flavors, yeasty flavors and spice. A nice slow sipping Belgian strong dark,; great for a relaxing evening on a cool night."
""
"Compared to my favorite, Trois Pistoles, it really does lack in the champagne carbonation. However, it's dangerously drinkable with its 10.5% ABV. What lovely and complex full flavors this beer has."
""
"Delicious beer. Think the aroma trumps the flavor. But highly complex malt and yeast esters. A little too sweet mid palate, and the finish is somewhat of a disappointment."

"Gulden Draak is a classic Belgian ale and a gateway beer for many. At its price point, it cannot be beat. My only complaint was the amount of alcohol heat on the finish. Even with a year-plus of age on this bottle, it was still quite hot."
"D: Overall this is a phenomenal brew and an outstanding example of style. Excellent drinkability, especially given the ABV."
"O- good strong ale, nice sweet flavors and dark fruits. I bet with some age the alcohol would mellow and the carbonation might lighten as well."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"After giving the worst pour of all time into my Duvel glass, I think that I am ready to try Gulden Draak. Thankfully I am not disappointed. The smell of this beer is almost that of a tripel, with clove and banana flavors. On the other hand, it also produces a dark fruit smell, of plums and licorice. Alright, I'm pretty intrigued, so let's get into the taste. Holy damn. I am not disappointed, as a rush of plum, fig, raspberry and clove come to destroy my palette. The lacing on this beer is extraordinary, as it goes down all the way throughout the glass. Mouthfeel is pretty good, with high carbonation, not as much as Duvel, but still pretty high for a BSDA. Overalll, this is one of the best dark ales that I've had, and am looking forward to trying this again in the future."
""
""
""
""
""
"A very well done BSDA. Complex flavor profiles, and while the alcohol is noticeable, it really serves to compliment the flavors, rather than distract from them."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Deep copper and clear with a huge beige head. Very inviting. Aroma is spicy with hints of brown sugar. Rich, malty and slightly sweet. Good depth of flavor. The alcohol isn't hot but it is there. The mouthfeel is thick and creamy. This is a rich tasty beer best enjoyed slowly."

"Overall: one of the better triples I've had. More on the aggressive side then an easy drinker but forces you to love it. Definitely an elite brew"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Wonderful flavor. Smooth start with nice Carmel and fruit back end. The only down side is that's a little thick on the tongue, but that's very minor. Other dubs and trips are overly sweet, The Draak isn't. Would love to find bars that have it on tap."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O: For a 10.5% beer this does not feel like it. Very well balanced, clean belgian yeast, carbonation makes it great to clean the palate. This beer would go great with blue cheese, olives, pickled eggs."

""
""

"I haven't had this particular brew in awhile (and, it used to be a Belgian bar staple for me back in the day). I can't say that I still enjoy it as much, but it's still a fine ale, worthy of a recommendation."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - There's a slight harshness in the finish that detracts from this beer. Hard to believe the ABV is that high as the alcohol isn't too obviously although it is noticeable. Still pretty good and easy to drink."
""
"O: This is a great Belgian strong dark ale that you can find just about anywhere."

"Very fine dark ale. This is what Belgian ales are all about."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, there are really quite a few complexities in this beer and it really has a lot of fruit notes from tropical to dark. With a little less sweetness this beer would be really outstanding."
""
"A careful pour produces a clear ruby brown liquid with an overflowing beige head that dissipates rather quickly. Smells of wet cardboard, rich caramel malts, bits of dark fruit. Airing it for a bit thankfully removed most of the aromas of oxidation. The flavor is sweet with lots of brown and caramelized sugars. Deep rich dark fruits mixed with a hint of alcohol round out the flavor quite nicely. Medium to thick body with a moderate to high level of carbonation and a sweet bubbly mouthfeel. This is a nice dark ale I quite enjoyed it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-Lots of flavor, a big time appearance, this beer is tasty and one to savor. I would best describe this as a Barleywine/Quad hybrid."
""
"I would consider this one of the best beers I've ever had!"
""
""
""
""
"None the less it was unlike any other beer I have ever tasted before in my life and was quite an experience and pleasure to taste this beer, just not up my alley as far as favorite tastes."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: The smell and flavors don't seem to work together for me. The fruitiness seems to lean more towards a Belgian Pale than a Belgian Dark. I didn't finish the entire bottle; that being said, I'm scoring '4' here to raise the overall score to a more adequate overall number."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I’ve had more a few of this style and I’d have to say that this is more of the most compelling versions. I really liked the complexity of the malts, especially with that cigar/tobacco note that was played up. I think the spiciness and bitterness were great foils for the otherwise overwhelming sweetness. Kudos to the brewers!"
""
"Complex and sharp. Pours deep copper red with ample, frothy head that delights. Restrained fresh citrus nose. This welterweight packs an acerbic, powerful, deeply-sugared malt bite that lingers, dissolving into alcohol-laced bitter, peppered finish that dissolves surprisingly quickly. Rewarding and sometimes overpowering, not for the faint of heart."
""
""
""
"O: I'm really quite pleased with this; I'll certainly be getting more of this to enjoy, and I'll be looking for other brews by Van Steenberge."
"O - Not surprisingly this brew did not fail to deliver, offering up loads of flavour and an incredibly well hidden ABV. Delicious is an understatement, well worth trying out."
""
"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a goblet, no bottle date.his pours a reddish brown tea color slightly cloudy with a nice tan head which dissipates down to a thin head. The smells are somewhat good, you get some dark fruit, candied sugar and alcohol. The feel is medium high carbonination. The taste is good but very potent alcohol burn and a level of booziness, the taste is also of candied sugar and dark fruit."
"Wow! One of the best heavy, dark brews I've had in recent memory. Incredible balance and complexity in this big, bold beer. It is a areal pleasure to sip such an immense beer that emphasizes the malt, hops, and other ingredients while taming the relatively high ABV and not letting it dominate the overall flavor."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a deep reddish amber in color with a big white head and some nice lacing. The smell is of mostly candied sugar and dark fruits, and I pick up hints of bourbon as well. Tastes of molasses raisins heavily laced with belgian test notes and spicing and very little booze shows through. The mouthfeel is a bit thick but style appropriate. A very solid Belgian offering."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A tasty deep ruby hued brew, grape, candied sugar, sweet bread, belgian yeast, warm alcohol, booze is present but works with the other flavours, medium to full bodied with little carbonation, this is a concoction that would be great for an hour by the fire"
"notes; WOW, what a great beer!!"
""
""
"Overall, this may be my favorite dark Belgian. Great beer."
""
""
""
""
"O: Just an excellent beer all around. My hasty review really doesn't do it justice. It's an absolute must-try. It paired very well with a nice French Munster, but it could probably complement a lot of big, assertive cheeses. The scrubbing carbonation does wonders to lift some of the heavier, creamier cheese textures."
"O- Great, complex beer. Very drinkable for the alcohol level."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

""
""
"This is no mythical beast of awesome power. It's a solid take on the style and brings some unique malts to the party, but it ultimately lacks depth and an overall appeal."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Haven't had this one in a while and it's pretty much just as I remember it.  Solid strong Belgian flavor that's complex but still approachable.  I used some salty Danish Havarti to cut the sweetness and slight booze bite."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Bottle from Belgian Beer Shop.com. Hazy amber. The head is thick and off white. Leaves a very nice lacing on the glass. The aroma is filled with fruits. It's sweet, vinous and yeasty. A very intense smell. The taste is very complex with licorice, spices, malts and yeast. The mouthfeel is very full and rich. A very long medium bitter finish. This is one of my all time favorites."
""

"I am enthralled with this beer yet dismayed at the other reviews regarding taste and smell. One reviewer mentioned creamed pears. I believe it is more like bittersweet prunes prepared with the smokey essence from french pine bark. This also correlates to the hint of bakers chocolate. However, that is a false tasting note which can fool the novice. You see, as the french pine bark tree is expertly roasted, it will certainly lend itself to the essence of bitter chocolate. It is this essence which has been expertly infused within this fine beer. Bottom line is... I kind of like it. Im gonna buy it again when i have a hankering for some sweet light wood."
""

"M - Medium-to-thick body. As the beer warms I get more and more booze warmth. Pleasing and balanced carbonation. Overall, a great mouthfeel and makes for a great sipper."

"O – This is a beer to grow old with, I love this beer, I will have this beer countless times again over the course of my life. I’m sure I’ll find beers I enjoy more in the years I have left to me, as my exploration is still just in it’s infancy, but this beer is one of the first beers I have ever fallen truly in love with. It is a sonnet, a cool and refreshing breeze, the welcome company of a good friend, and a solemn promise of good things to come. Thank you gulden draak."
""

"This one's a powerhouse. It's surprisingly easy to drink considering the potency of it. But I've chosen to sip it very slowly considering the complexity and cost of it. At $5 per bottle this is a nice ""special occasion"" beer - not something I would drink on a regular basis but worth every penny when I do."
""
"O / long aftertaste. Excellent and complex belgian ale. One of my favourites."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a very delectable Belgian ale which, at a well concealed 10.5% ABV, can sneak up on you if you're not careful. If it wasn't for the large price tag, I would drink this beer much more frequently."

"O - a fine ale with good flavor, relatively high alcohol but not overpowered by the alcohol. Definitely one for sipping on cool nights, not gulping after mowing the lawn in July. Definitely a re-buy."

"Would I buy it again? Yes,"
""
""

"750 ml caged and corked bottle. Served in a Unibroue tulip, the beer pours a murky reddish/mahogany brown color with about an inch light tan head that stayed around a little while. There's also a good amount of lacing. Aroma is very nice, it smells like dark fruit, caramel, yeast, spice and some candied fruit. Taste pretty much is the same as the aroma, but there's also some candy sugar and bready malt noticeable. It's a very sweet and malty brew. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's smooth and creamy with moderate carbonation. I think this is a pretty good beer. I know I'd buy this again."

"overall? this was also a part of a sampler pack (again). not bad stuff overall in the sampler pack and it's not not a bad brew, but there are certainly some better brews from belgium. considering all beers i've had from all nationalities, this is a fine beer for having a 10.5% content. but comparing against other belgiums, it's a little too tart, tangy, bitter, dark-fruity for me. still drinkable and always welcome, though..."

"Taste is smooth and similarly fruit-oriented, with a hint of yeastiness at the end. Also, near the finish, there's a definite alcohol warming. Overall, this is a world class brew, exquisitely drinkable and complex. A must-try for anyone interested in fine, true Belgian ales."
"Food match: Its a tough beer to match - the headiness and bold flavours make it sit between the boundary of heavy roast game meats and dessert. In a way both would work well so my suggestion would be: roast haunch of venison with roast vegetables and a thick pepper gravy, followed by a dark chocolate and baked fig ganache with a berry compote."
"O- An obvious Belgian Strong Dark Ale. Would be great on a crisp, cool evening...not a cold night or a hot day."

""

"Gulden Draak – The bottle says: “NA”"
"Poured into a chalice. Pours dark caramel brown with a light tan head that dissipates quickly. Plenty of bubbles can be seen rising from the side and bottom of the glass in the initial pour, but not much is seen after that. The booze is strong with this one in the aroma. I can also pick up the dark candi sugar, Belgian yeast, and bready malt. I can also pick up that dark fruit aroma that is common with this style. There are good flavors here. I can pick up the bready malt, sweetness from the dark candi sugar, and the fruity flavors from the yeast. I can also pick up the alcohol here. The body is full with moderate carbonation. The finish is dry. This is a good sipper. This is an excellent beer."

"1/4 of a sampler. Body is a deep amber with an appropriate white head. The smell is just loaded with bubble gum. I was blown away. More bubble gum than any other German hefeweizen. The taste is very candy sweet. It goes down so easy and smooth, with enough backing from the malt to make it palatable."

"Pours a cloudy mahogany red with a two finger slighty off white head. A nice banana strain comes through on the nose, plums and rasains follow, finishes with a toffee meets alcohol touch. Carbonation right on the tongue opens the mouth up for more banana, some citrus, dark fruits and slight lingering vanilla. Biscuity malts fill up the mouth and give a metallic sorta flavor, slight detection of alcohol heat and finishes with a nice cheery wood flavor. Full bodied beer, moderate carbonation, leaves the pallete dry and wanting more. Great beer, dont know where ""dark tripple"" comes from this beer drinks like a BSA like any other, very complex, fruity, and extremely delicious. Cheers."

"I refer to this beer as the ""Hair of the Dog"" beer. Best for a hangover! I went to the Redwood City Brew Haus and was recommended along with the German food to help me from the wine party the night before. It worked for the high alcohol level. With that said, I didn't know what to think at first with the distinct white label and wasn't prepared for the full body taste. The after taste is a tad bitter but not overwhelming. This is a sipping beer like a good scotch. Tiny sips at a time not a drink it down quickly style of beer. One to be enjoyed slowly to enjoy the smooth texture. Cheers!"

"Pours a clear brown with a tan head that settles to an oily film on top of the beer. Small streaks of lace form all over the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, caramel, toffee, brown sugar, and spice aromas. Taste is much the same with a mild spice bitterness on the palate after each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer with some nice aromas and flavors but I am not too sure I could drink too much of this one at a time."

"Poured into a snifter, this living beer poured a reddish tinted dark brown and emitted a generous head. Apparently, the yeast was tired of being bottled up, and wanted out desperately. When the bubbles mellowed, the aroma was mildly sweet. Hints of banana and dry malt were present. The initial taste was sweet and smooth. Certainly, this is an easy drinker. A sweet banana flavor made an appearance with a mild spiciness. The flavor in this one is pretty close to perfect, it does not overwhelm and is not too mild. In the aftertaste, the tart fruit of a triple such as prune and over-ripe are present. The warming sensation of the alcohol does not burn like a a hard liquor, but is quite gentle. The aftertaste almost has the flavor of a good sherry. Like sherry, the first few sips are the best. If you drink to much, you risk failing to appreciate the complexity of the drink. This is one by favorites, and it is very accessable."
""
"I would recommend it any given time!"
"O: A nice dark belgian that’s a bit atypical to many others. Although the alcohol is high, this seems like it would be fairly approachable for Belgian newbies."

"Gulden Draak pours a hazy chestnut brown, with a voluminous four fingers or so of very light tan foam. Head retention is outstanding, it positively creeps down towards the body of the beer. Lacing isn't quite up there with the best Belgians though, it's fairly spotty. The nose is wonderful, heavy on figs and raisins and brown sugar, with just a little bit of alcohol creeping in in the background. The flavor profile can't quite follow through on all that though, as it's very heavy on plums, and the booziness (while still not harsh) is a bit more prevalent here. The brown sugar is faded significantly, an the dark fruit aspect of the beer doesn't have the same depth, it's much more one note here. The body is sufficiently light for a high ABV Belgian beer, but the carbonation just doesn't quite have the activity/effervescence that some of the best do. This is my first time trying Gulden Draak in a couple years, and I'm enjoying it a bit more now than I remember. It's a well above average Belgian Strong Dark Ale."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a classic example of a traditional Belgian strong dark ale."
""
"I can add this to the “Why did I wait so long to try that?” list. Gulden Draak is a widely available, high quality Belgian offering everyone should try. I will look forward to having this again. It would be a good one to split between friends for a nightcap."
""
""
"Overall: Lots and lots to savor here. Just excellent. I used to be a fan of exclusively US craft breweries, but this one is hard to top by any US brewer. You just can't find a perfect balance like this anywhere else."

"O: Used to drink this quite frequently. Haven't had in over a year, and really can't figure out why it's been so long. A fantastic beer, definitely worth seeking out. Quite sweet and makes a complete dessert on its own."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Very enjoyable, doesn't taste or feel as strong as 10.5% which makes it dangerously drinkable, complex flavors keep you coming back for more."
""
""
"o: lots of different interesting flavors, but the alcohol presence and sweetness really got to me. at the end, it was difficult to finish rather than enjoyable once it had warmed up considerably. interesting beer, but flawed."
""
"O - There's plenty going on here, a top beer no doubt but just a touch to much sugar for my taste."
""
"Bravo!"
"not as good as i wanted it to be. pours a mahogany brown color with a bubbly tan head that almost immediately fades away. smells like dried fruit, belgian yeast, and big bready malts. flavor is less fruity than the nose but otherwise similar. the yeast is rich and unique in this one, really imparting an interesting flavor. mouthfeel was a letdown for me. it got flat as it warmed up and didnt hold any of its nice initial head. flavor was fine, but it didnt stand up well to highly seasoned prawns, which i was hoping it would have done brilliantly. in any event, its a good beer but at 16 dollars a bomber, ill drink another belgian."
""
""
""
"A nice level of carbonation opens the palate to sweet bready and fruity flavors of plums and raisins. The alcohol is not hidden at all. It comes in around mid-palate and warms things up substantially, lending the beer a distinct sherry-like quality. Very firm, almost oily mouthfeel. The beer is extremely strong and definitely a sipper. An outstanding beer to be sure, but the alcohol presence is a bit strong and may detract a bit from the overall drinking experience for some."

"Not going to do a standard review. Just wanted to say that I love dopplebocks and went into this beer expecting it to be similar to one since it was a triple. That being said, I was sadly disappointed. Maybe its just not my cup of tea. But it had no carbonation in the mouth, and was just like taking a bite out of fudge with nothing to wash it down. Just too much sweetness, mixed with the thickness of this beer was hard for me to get around. The biggest disappointment I had was the smell, So complex and inviting, makes your mouth water just thinking about it. Then the taste just doesn't do it justice. Overall I wouldn't buy one again."

"Poured from a 330ml bottle to my duvel tulip. Body of the beer is a hazy red-brown color. The pour yields a tan head about 2 fingers tall, carbonation can be seen rising in the beer. Retention isn't spectacular, but that is to be expected when this registers at 10.5 ABV. It recedes to a ring and an island of foam in the center of my glass. The smell is of rich sweet barley malt, some caramel, apple, Belgian yeast. In the taste I get a hint of apples up front as well as an acute candy sweetness. Towards the middle I notice more dark fruit, sweet heavy malts. I also detect some alcohol in the taste. Mouthfeel is on the thicker side, but some assertive carbonation livens it up. This is a really interesting beer, I like the idea of a dark triple, and this one is put together really well."
""
""
"Mouthfeel is very much lacking- I like a well carbonated beer. This one is vert syrupy and has no carbonation. If it was better carbonated I would love this beer- however, I've had it on tap and out of the bottle and both are extremely flat. I won't try it again."
""
""
""
""
"O: incredible, this beer has such incredible taste and flavor profile, this is absolutely going to be purchased again and again, wow"
""
""
"Bottle split and shared with a friend. Pours a very dark cherry wood color. Capped off by a good amount of fluffy foam. Retained fair enough. The nose was very fruity with plum, strawberry, pineapple. Finished out with a mild yeast aroma. Good heft to the feel, stands under the weight of the alcohol quite well. Fruit flavors carry over where the aroma started things off. Plum, raisin, sweet pale fruitiness. The yeast character is not as pronounced as other BSDAs I've encountered. This is not a bad thing. Not a style I usually stock my fridge with, but this is not a bad beer at all."
""
""
""
"Overall- Very Drinkable Belgium beer that is acutally rather complex.At 10.5 abv you wouldn't know it as it is so well balanced."
""
""
"- Hard to find, expensive, and rare in these parts. I'm glad I ran across it. Your average consumer won't be out looking for it. I suggest anyone reading this to go seek it out. It's a stellar beer. It's to be had slightly warm, and is a sipper. Drink it, and pair it with some nice red meats and crisped veggies. Perhaps some spicy stuff as well. It's solid and truly shows the art form of brewing."

"O: Overall this is a quite nice beer and very enjoyable. I would definitely enjoy another of these (even right now if I had one on hand). The high ABV is well hidden in the taste and it kind of sneaks up on you."
""
""
"I have never given all ""5's"" on a rating as to date. I had to bow down in awe at this beer! It is an absolute MASTERPIECE! Nice white cap head with a tremendously appealing dark brown color. Scented of light apricots with a splash of maraschino cherries. The taste is so clear and clean. I couldn't even fathom that this brew was 10.5%. Despite that I could session this beer, well maybe for about 90 minutes. It goes down with a slight oft-plum taste with crazy belgian yeasts and smooth, crispy effervescent flavors. I could not find a morsel wrong with this one. It should be on the USA banned substances list!"
""

"for under 4$ I really can't complain, not the best Belgian I've had recently but certainly nothing to be ashamed of"

"330ml bottle. The beer pours a dark brown color with a large off-white to tan head. The aroma has a lot of Belgian candy sugar as well as some dark fruit and a little bit of toffee. The flavor is full of dark fruit. I get a lot of raisins, as well as some cherry and plum notes. There is a little bit of sweetness from the candy sugar, as well as some brown sugar and molasses notes. The alcohol is very well hidden and is barely noticeable. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. A very nice beer."

"Overall this was o.k. Not as good as I had hoped it would be. Have one cellaring and I hope it improves."

"O: Yum. 4"
"Poured on-tap and served in a chalice, the beer is a clear, dark, orange-hued brown coloring with no head. Beer is very clean in the glass. Aromas of toffee and caramel sweetness, with a slight hopping to balance. The nose is balanced amazingly, and very subtle. Extremely smooth in mouth, with a boozey kick right off the bat. Flavors are toffee sweet malt with a ton of old world fruit charcteristics, including dates, currants, and some raisin. The aftertaste is rich and tangy sweet, with a touch of toffee and hops, and a little bit of warmth at the end of the palate. The finish is slick, and almost creamy. Delicious beer! Masterfully blended and balanced."

"O - A top class Belgian brew that is a must try."
"Beautiful beer that has an extremely unique flavor profile for this style. I very well might consider trying this one again. That said at 10.3% it isn't something I'll look for often."
"Overall: I rate it a 4.5."
"Poured a cloudy reddish brown with a light tan head and some sticky lace. Good head retention. Nose has some dark fruits, grapes and raisin, and some gentle spicing. Taste has more dried dark fruits and grapes, some vinous notes, booze and some toffee-like sweetness. High carbonation that is a bit peppery in feel, and a heavy moderately boozy body. Long sweet finish. Solid but not great, I wouldn't have this as a first option in light of other BSDA's on the market."
""
""
""
""
"Overall I will have to be back to get another 5oz pour for 2 bucks. It drinks like heaven on tap a great strong ale."
"Let it warm in the glass for about 5 mins, it really does breathe well. A great taste, not too harsh, but you do taste a bit of the alcohol. The reviews I've read are a bit mixed, but I'm glad I pulled this one off the shelf. A great brew to end my long day at work. I'll definitely buy again if I can find it. Cheers!"

"an awesome creamy thick tan three finger head sits atop a body of beer that changes color with every direction i look at it. i see shades of brown, purple, mahogany and amber. retention and lacing is outstanding.nose is kinda faint with some malt, candied fruit and earth tones mixed together. taste is really sweet. i can pick out notes of grapes, prunes, spice, malts but mostly alochol. mouthfeel is thick and syrupy. great carbonation and a warming finish. this is a big time beer in a little bottle."

"O: This was one of the first authentic Belgian ales that I really became attached to, and as such, I can't help being a little bit biased when I review it. I still think Gulden Draak is an exceptional ale, and I seem to return to it again and again. In my opinion, this is the best beer made by Brouwerij Van Steenberge."

"Dark brown with diminutive cherry hues and covered with a quickly disappearing tan head. Nose consists of rum, plums, raisins, spice and diacetyls. Aroma is robust and concerted. Tastes of more dark fruits and has a definite vinous feel. Behind that are some sweet caramel notes, more rum booziness and a hint of butterscotch. Slightly syrupy with a creamy core and dry edges. Medium to heavy mouth-feel. Alcohol is noticeable. Brand new Belgian for me, and one of the best I've had in a while."

"Deep chestnut brown colour, ruby highlights, collar of white head that pancaked on top with some lace. Smell is full of dark fruit and brown sugar, yeasty, raisin, plum, dark bread, sweet scentd, quite malty. Taste follows the nose with dark fruit soaked in alcohol, yeast, raisin, cherry, quite sweet and at times bordering on cloying. Medium carbonation, full body with a nice overall feel. Pretty solid stuff, I remember liking this much more the first time I tried it and found this bottle a little underwhelming, that being said it is still rather enjoyable."

"O - This is world class stuff, and definitely a definitive example of the style. Maybe the best example. In order to see if it trumps Chimay Blue, I will have to do repeated tastings of both. Lucky me."
"O - a very interesting ale, perfect for winter/cold weather consumption."
"Appearance is amber in color and pours nice with a nice balance of foam. Smell, there is a hint of hops and notes of roasting. Mouthfeel is clean and crisp, no after taste. Taste, HOPPY, yea, Oh this is a barley wine in our book. Overall this is a nice drinking beer. This will go well with fried oysters.."
"Overall – What a fantastic tasting beer. I can't believe how well the alcohol is hidden and it is truly a dream to drink. I was a little disappointed in it's boring appearance in the glass but the taste and smell more than makes up for it. This is a world class beer that is a must try."
"Overall, this is one of the best beers I've had in a long while. Great stuff!"
"O- A well-made BSDA, but in comparison I'd prefer Trois Pistoles, especially given the price."
"O: A nice, rich beer that packs a kick and represents its style well. While the mixture of fruits and sweetness was appealing, I would have liked to see a slightly more complex malt bill. I imagine some more burnt notes would go well with this beer. But hey, that's just me. Definitely a keeper, though, and worth going back to."
"D: I might have to put aside a couple more bottle of this to age (although it will be hard to do). Without a doubt, aged or not, one of the best belgian strong ales I've ever had. This is definitely the measuring stick for me when it comes to this style."
"Overall: A great beer that gives an amazing head with the sweet smell of caramelized plums and an almost syrup like mouthfeel, much like the women I prefer. Highly recommended."
"Gulden Draak pours a hazy red brown with a beautiful fluffy, foamy off white head that doesn't quit. The aroma is sweet, with tons of ripe fruit and estery, slightly chalky yeast. Sweet, syrupy malt hits upfront in the flavor, dying down just a bit as the esters fade. The fruitiness in there, with some nice, slightly burnt caramel. There is some bitterness in the finish, and the fruity esters linger. Dark malty flavor lingers in the aftertaste. The alcohol is present, but light considering the strength. The mouthfeel is smooth and creamy, with plenty of fizzy carbonation."
"this is so damn good. i really cant wait to try their quad thats coming out."
"D: nice to see such a recently bottled brew that is not too hot. especially on this big of a body. great fruit and sweetness. very enjoyable belgian."
"Overall: This is a wonderfully complex beer, very much a sipper. I do not think I could drink these every day, but when the opportunity arises, this is a great beer for sharing with friends."
"Drinkability: Outstanding! This is an excellent example of a Belgian Strong Dark Ale. It has a unique flavor profile with a lot of complexity. It's a fantastic sipping beer that tastes even better as it warms. I have a new favorite Belgian ale!"
"Overall a good beer, worth trying once in awhile. Just too pricey."
"Very complex, intriguing beer. Not for the faint of heart!"
"Big fizzy cream colored head which recedes within the first couple sips leaving a small amount of lace. Smells of alcohol and sweet roasted malt, raisins(?), sweet bread. Pours a very dark colored brown. Some light visible through the glass, but not much. A kick ass Belgian Ale. This is what Belgium is known for. So so smooth and a “big” beer for sure. Very complex. It only gets better as it warms. Enjoy with a hearty meal."
"This beer pours a brown color with a decent off white head. The smell is sweet and lightly spicey with some definite dark fruit notes. the flavor follows suit with some brown sugar dark fruit sweet flavors followed by a little spiceynesss from the yeast. the mouthfeel is medium bodied with a good feel. overall this beer is damn tasty and veryu sweet"
"O: Very fruit and sweeter than most but it’s still a pretty good beer. There are other’s I’d pick first though."
"O - Super glad I got to try this one. I will age one and report back in a few years. Until then, cheers!"
"O - I feel there are better strong dark ales than this. It was goos, but way, way too boozy for my liking."
"Strong, potent and heady, this really is a cheek burner which is sure to warm your cockles in the coldest, wettest and dampest of Scottish Winters. Makes sense now really."
"D - Great beer, I picked this up in Italy at a local grocery store, brought it back to the states and finally had it; I wish we had more beers like this in the US; anyway, its a great drink with great dark fruit flavors and fantastic nose; not for the faint of heart"
"O: This is a very, very nice Belgian Strong Dark Ale. Complex but still modest."
"O: A good solid beer. Not my favorite BSDA but solid. A bit pricey to buy regularly when there are others I prefer."
"Great Belgium beer that won my vote over the other 5 purchased in the mixed pack."
"overall, an excellent beer. can't believe it's taken me this long to try it. can't place it among my favorite belgians, but very, very good nonetheless."
"O - a nice BSDA that is tasty, but there are definitely others I prefer to it."
"Overall, this is a solid beer. A bit sweet for my liking, but solid in each of the components and overall enjoyable."
"Paid $13.99 for a four pack of the Draak in Atlanta, GA."
"On the tongue, the fruity spiciness is full and ever-blossoming, starting off with huge caramelized brown sugar and dark fruit esters, and progressing from even there into a heady brew over which gods probably fight wars. Vanilla, oak, apricot, plum and some port-like flavors mingle with champagne sweetness, with just enough hops to balance everything out and keep the brain from leaping out of the skull in sheer joy. A slight alcohol tinge colors the edges, but this enhances, rather than inhibits the overall effect. This is truly an astounding ale."
"Overall Drinkability - Delicious. Absolutely awesome. One of the best beers I've had in months."
"O: A pretty solid beer, not something I am running out to drink all the time, but would grab it once in a while."
"The CPJ"
"O - Gulden Draak is one of my all-time favorites, and this review reflects that. It retains all of the gloriousness of a quality Belgian brewed tripel, but the darkness of it adds a dimension that not many tripels can match. Its fruit profile is darker than most tripels (dark fruits, fewer of the lighter fruits you sometimes get in lighter tripels), almost making it Quad like. But this is a superb beer, among the best ever crafted in my judgement. That's kinda why its part of my avatar."
"A little alcohol comes through, but is not too distracting. Different but excellent BSDA."
"M&D: smoothly-carbonated, full-bodied and, as experienced throughout the drink, fantastically drinkable; this is a creamy-malty and yeasty ale that doesn’t come very complex but surprisingly easy-drinking amongst its counterparts."
"O: A unique Belgian triple. A delight with every sip. Maybe needs a bit more hop, but other than that. It's pretty much perfect in my eyes. Would recommend and buy all the time. You can also have this at room temp. Doesn't need to be that cold in my opinion."
"I love it when a beer sexy on the outside turns out to be sexy on the inside too. Poured almost all head in a light beige color. The body held to the light is a deep brown with reddish tinge. It smells of malt but also dried fruits. Taste is double what you'd expect from the smell plus there's nice caramel. Although the alcohol content of 10.5% is noticeable I think the booziness complements the flavors and experience. Throw in the unusual bottle shape and lovely golden dragon label and you've got one heck of a fun beer experience."
"Atmosphere is pretty good. Nice body with a bubbly head. Settles qucikly though and no lacing. Nose is a combination of malt, and sweetness; with something of a woody body. Flavor is malty but sweet, with a lightly bitter finish and a high alcohol profile. Overall, this is a really good quaff."
"The great body of this beer can be perfectly combined with a light, vegetarian dinner of pasta, tomatoes, aubergine, courgette and garlic. Like I did today! Lovely."
"Overall: Too alcoholic, too sweet and not a very good mouthfeel"
"O - A sturdy, strong beer with a complexity and roundness to it."
"O: Good beer, easy to drink for the ABV. Can be slightly warm on the finish at times, but otherwise, very well done beer."
"This is a different BSDA. I like that's it's very sweet without being cloying and finishes very dry. Lots of cocoa in there as well."
"Overall not too bad an interesting take, not getting the hop presence it mentions so much on the bottle but an otherwise enjoyable beer."
"O-I've run a bar for years and drank many styles of beer but I'm gonna say that this one is my favorite so far. So delicious in fact, I EASILY downed the whole 750ml bottle feeling absolute euphoria after. I think I could have had one more glass but I wonder what that would have done to me. You forget the ABV because it's like eating a chocolate cake. I'm not gonna give it a perfect 5 only because even if I like it myself, it does not represent its style well and I'm sure that this is a ""Black or White"" beer. You either hate it or love it. It's hard for me to imagine someone not liking it but oh well. All I can say is BIG, ROBUST and SATISFYING! DO IT!"
"O: great belgian dark for certain occasions but not one I would buy every day."
"O: A very luxurious ale that should be sipped slowly to enjoy all the flavors and because of the high alcohol content. Highly recommended!"
" Belisimo, Bravo!"
"O- A decent belgian dark ale, not quite as complex as chimay but still ncie flavor and the fruit flavor is really enjoyable. Appearance could have been improved with higher head retention. Still a great beer."
"Opens big, malty and sweet with suggestions of dark fruits -- primarily raisins and plums -- and toasty roasted malts. A toffee-like sweetness surfaces, balancing any evidence of bittering hops. Smooth and chewy mouthfeel throughout. Warm and peppery notes emerge before finishing dry. 10.5% ABV is well concealed. Pairs well with a tasty BLT and side of pommes frites."
"Heck of a lot of head on this one! Beautiful amber/brown color and a slightly spicy aroma. The spiciness continues from the front of the tongue to the back of the throat and the flavor sticks with you for a while without changing into an odd aftertaste. I think 'warming' is the best way to describe how it feels in the mouth. This is a beer to be enjoyed slowly in front of a hot fire."
"This stuff is really great, one of my favorites I've had recently."
"Overall, very good beer. Interesting hybrid between a tripel and a BSDA. The typical flavour profile of a triple is certainly present, though modified in a rather unique way. Very enjoyable."
"Small light brown head. Moderate carbonation. Medium brown in color. Aroma is a bit light, maybe because it's a bit cool, maybe some apple and dark fruit, alcohol. Apple, slightly bitter, some dried fruit. Somewhat warming. Medium body. Slightly fruity sweet finish."
"O- This one doesn't really grow on you. As it warms more flavors becomes present, but not necessarily for the better. It works... it's strong w/o being overbearing, and it has a unique flavor profile. Beyond that, I think it's another overrated Belgian beer that is too quirky for it's own good."
"This beer poured out as a light brownish color with a light tan colored head. The head is a little fizzy but does have a little bit of retention to it. The lacing isn't strong but it's got just a little bit going on from time to time. The smell of the beer had an earthy spiced aroma to it mixed with some bright fruity notes and a touch of booze. The taste of the beer had a subtle sweetness to it upfront and had a slight bite to it in the aftertaste from the settling spices. There's a little bit of bread in the taste too. The mouthfeel is well carbonated and almost medium bodied. Overall this beer is good on mostly every level and really worth trying if you haven't already."
"Cheers!"
"D: Great but a knockout with the alc %"
"I realize this is supposed to be strong, but I much rather prefer the taste of alcohol over super sweetness. I’ll keep this one in mind next time my sweet tooth is craving some candy."
"O: When I think of this style, I think ""Duvel with heavier malts."" While Gulden Draak isn't exactly on Duvel's level for me, it fulfilled my definition of the style quite well. It's malty, strong, but a little too light for me to love it."
"Sweeter than other Belgian tripples and quads. No off flavors. Good but not great."
"Excellent mouthfeel with a heavy front end of wheat that dissipates quickly, leaving a sweet malty taste on the palate. Very good dark Belgian. Not my favorite, but certainly authentic."
"Drink- I can't believe I have never had this. I thought for sure I had. Oh well, stranger things have happened. This was a good BSDA but needed more pop."
"I don't think I could physically stomach more than 2 or 3 of these in a night--they are so rich. However, I would happily drink this night after night. Very good beer."
"O: This was an excellent beer. I can see people saying it might be a little too sweet but I really enjoyed it. I’ll definitely be buying this beer again."
"(revisited and tweaked in Jan. 2015)."
"Overall - Good flavor, for sure. Nothing I haven't tasted before, but still good. I just don't like the dryness in the finish."
"O: Tangy, malty, and somewhat sweet; this is the perfect beer to have beside the fire on a cold winters night."
"Dr: Hides its ABV quite well. Affordable and worth a try for any beer fanatic."
"Drink and overall: Nice Belgium triple. The color is beautiful and the brew is inviting."
"Overall a solid beer."
"Creamy finish with a long caramel toned after tase."
"Gulden Draak is 4 sure one of my all time fav beers. This belgian strong dark ale has some amazing toffee like smell and sweetness that few beers can match. I've had the pleasure of having this in both bottle and on draft in the same night, not many beers i can say that about. This beer just tastes great, not for everybody though, the sweetness factor gets some people, but i thing the 10.5% of the beer evens the sweetness out to a pretty close to perfect beer!"
"This is a beer that really succeeded. That having been said, I didn't love it. It has a sweet and sour taste that blends very well and it us a nice drinkability to it. Sweet and sour just isn't what I like but for a Belgian, which are often too sweet for me, this is a goof option."
"Excellent, loved the flavors in this beer, very fragrant. Classic example of a well made Belgian."
"O: A very good BSDA. Good aroma, flavor, and a nice high attenuation to keep it from being too sweet. Not the best bang-for-your-buck, but one of the better examples of the style out there."
"Poured into a signature stem glass. Rich, hazy, dark, mahogany color with a nice tannish finger of head that retains well. Toasted biscuits and dark fruits in the aroma. Taste starts off with toasty caramel malts and some caramelized sugars and a touch of molasses, with yeasty biscuits and grainy, unsubdued alcohol following. Dark dried fruits in the background. Medium mouthfeel, and can be a bit syrupy, but overall nice and drinkable, though on the strong side."
"Great beer."
"aromas of toffee and sourdough bread. tastes slightly sweet, caramel, biscuity malt. finish is slightly herbal and boozy. smooth mouthfeel, medium body. carbonation enough to tingle."
"Overall I like it but think it can be intense."
"O (D) - This is a real good beer. Tasty, and interesting, offering something a little bit different from what I expect from a BSDA, but it's definitely solid."
"Gulden Draak has a medium body with light carbonation. I'd describe it as ""chewy"" and smooth. Even with an ABV of 10.5% it's drinkable."
"I tried this brew on tap at The Good Life in Massapequa Park, NY. The brew poured a dark mahogony with a cream colored head. The ose was of malty sweetness. The taste was sweet and not the least bit boozy for such a high ABV. This is a very drinkable brew and will certainbly be on my list for years to come. A mainstay ond always front and center on tap at TGL. Enjoy!!!"
"Overall, a very good BSDA that can hang with some of the tops in the style."
"O: Not my favorite tripel, largely because of the absurdly alcoholic character that overwhelms the other flavors. Still, if that doesn't bother you than there is a lot to recommend this beer. The yeast and malts are balanced nicely, and the sweetness is nice."
"Cheers!"
"Pours a dark cooper color with a tight head. The aroma is of dark fruits plums, raisins, and dark cherries along with a hint of apricot and beligan yeast. The taste has a nice yeasty sweetness to it, very enjoyable with an apricot flavor in the middle. The mouthfeel is moderate carbonation. Overall very solid the alcohol is well hidden and the flavor is nice and well balanced. Overall you could easily enjoy a lot of these."
"O: Very solid beer but a little too carbonated for my tastes."
"Tasting this beer you will immediately fall in love with this perfectly measured fruit composition up front, being met with a sensitively calculated amount of malty flavors. At the end this full bodied beer finishes up with an immaculate hop, that rounds the beer up with a beautyful mouthfeel. The alcohol is nicely hidden. This beer is a work of art. Buy it wherever you can. I would drive 25 miles just to get another bottle.what a great beer!!!"
" ~ There's a reason this beer is considered one of the best on the planet. Try one for yourself so that you too can witness a great beverage."
"A decent strong Belgian dark ale - fairly rounded, despite the obvious focus on the fruit character, and a pleasant and recommended version of the style. Oh, and that 21-proof dragon of booze? Well domesticated, to say the least."
"Overall- Dark Tripel? Whatever that means... This is a fantastic Belgian dark ale, one of my favorites!"
"O: One of those classic beers and one that I still enjoy a decent amount. Not a favorite, but solid."
"O: This was a somewhat unique beer in the idea of a dark triple. While I do generally like my BSDA thick with light to moderate carbonation, I thought the triple aspect of this worked quite well because of how the foam helped smooth it out and create a creamy mouthfeel."
"Another classic brew from Belgium"
"overall this is a good beer not as crazy about it as other people are but its a very solid belgian strong ale."
"O: This is no doubt one of the defining beers in the category, and rightly so. It offers beer lovers plenty of complexity and is a great example of brewing craftsmanship. While I can appreciate the beauty of this beer, personally I feel that it is overly sweet, fruity and astringent (the high ABV certainly does not help its cause). I certainly could not drink more than one of these. Perhaps it's an acquired taste?"
"Notes: Quite iconic, while nice it does not drive me particularly crazy, but socially it is not that unapproachable brew to offer, and I understand the iconic reputation."
"O: This is very good but certainly not world class. I am reluctant to drink it again because it is $4.99 per 330 mL and $10.99 per 750 mL."
"Tan red with brown at the top and towards the center. Cloud of thick off-white foam on top that sticks around for a while. Aroma of rock candy, sugar, dark fruit, grapes, fig, and some bread. Strong flavor of belgian candy sugar, raisins, prunes, cola, echo of spice, malty sweetness, and slight warming booze. Heavy in body with medium carbonation. A thick, sweet drink that is insanely drinkable despite the ABV; it's almost thirst quenching. Rather satisfying for the palate and the belly as well."
"Overall- Very solid beer, seems like it is it's own style as I haven't seen any other dark tripels one of my favorites now."
"D - Overall, a good beer, just I expected more with the hype"
"D-Seems like a beer to sip on occasion. I wouldn't go buy 6 of them (especially at 3.50-4.00 bucks a bottle) but every now and then it's nice to drink something different and delicious. Reward yourself with this ale, you won't be dissapointed."
"Poured into oversized wine glass. Huge frothy light brown head. Coloring is a dark brown woody color. Very dark beer. Light does not pass through it. Think I will have to let this one warm a tad before I go further. The nose is very sweet. Has a good sweet burnt sugary smell. A twinge of the plum smell but mostly the sweet sugar with a bit of an earthy tone. Taste is a nice spicy sugar mix. Dried plums with a twist of a slight hop bitterness follows it up. The sugar, fruit, bitterness and earthy notes all come together nicely in the middle even though they are distinct in the front and the back. Does have a slight burn in the throat but I noticed most Belgian Strong Dark Ales do. Actually this is the first Belgian I have had in a long time. At least a year. I do have a hard time picking out the differences between Quad and this style but I can't complain because they are both great."
"The only downside is that, at the time I didn't realize that it was 10.5% ABV. My advice would be to drink this slowly and enjoy its brilliant qualities, because it can and WILL put you on your ass if you're not careful."
"Pours a dark caramel color, w/ a nice three finger head into my gulden draak glass. This looks like a serious beer. The smell is sweet, fruity, w/ a alcohol whiff as well. Really improves the warmer it gets. Some spice, raisins, dates and malt in there as well. I love the taste of this beer- it's definitely one of my favorite tripels. You get a nice sweet, sour, malt, fruit and alcohol taste all combined in a nice package. Nicely balanced. This beer definitely opens up nicely the warmer it gets. I'm thinking almost room temperature is ideal for Gulden Draak. Mouthfeel is nice, velvety- w/ the sweet, sour, and alcohol all in play. Smooths out quite a bit the warmer it gets. Drinkability is great. This beer is a sipper at 10.5% ABV, but it goes down a little too easy, and the alcohol will catch up to you quickly. Gulden Draak is world class- but do yourself a favor and drink it slightly chilled at almost room temperature."
"Mouthfeel / Drinkability - The alcohol is pretty well hidden for being 10.5% ABV. A very sweet and dark fruity beer. Most of the alcohol taste comes with the sweet fruit finish. I enjoyed this beer. For its style, it is high up on my list."
"The appearance is quite interesting, a chocolate cloudy look."
"I'm going to eventually give this beer another shot but it'll be awhile."
"Pours a cloudy dark mahogany with minimal head fading fast. Aromas contains some spice, roasted malts, and a hint of fruit, but dissipate soon after the pour. Taste is comprised of rum-like spice notes, dark candy, and roasted malts with a hint of bitterness from the hops peeking through. Smooth and sweet through the swallow with a slightly dry and bitter finish. Fairly well balanced, and warming, but lacks significant complexity and character. An above average brew, but nothing overly exceptional about its quality."
"D: I, for some reason, was expecting a Duvel knockoff. What I got, however, was one of the most delicious Belgian Strong Dark Ales out there. Much lighter and cleaner than many of the other examples, but with all of the complexity. This is definitely worth a shot for any fan of the Belgian style."
"This is a great way to get people to appreciate Belgian ales. And it works good accompanying a meal or as a sipper later on."
"This is a strange brew. I am surprised that the ""dark triple"" concept never caught on, for this style certainly has some interesting aspects. I think Gulden Draak is an incredible dessert beer, if nothing else."
"One of my favorite beers - ever!!!"
"D- Oh yes."
"Pours into custom glass with enormous head and very black coloring, with whitish tan head. Smell of faint alcohol and carmel malt with some slight yeasty notes. Fantastic flavor, slightly sweet with malty and roasty undertones, very refreshing despite the appearance. Dangerously easy to drink, as the soft mouthfeel coupled with the large head on the glass make it almost seem like you didn't get enough. Very drinkable, but more alcohol in the flavor than most will enjoy. Overall a very good beer that I hope to keep enjoying for many years."
"The alcohol is evident, but it is an enjoyable brew. Best to sip this one due to the alcohol and sweetness. Really an enjoyable beer though."
"In my opinion this is the best the beer I ever had. From this day on, I will cite this page whenever I feel a beer is the best I ever had."
"I would definitely try this beer again."
"Carbonation is crazy high."
"D - drinkable, but very heavy and full and also strong, so be carefull"
"This one could have been better if not so boozy. Yes, it has a high ABV, but it's just not as well balanced as some othre representatives of the style."
"This has some great fruit flavor. It is not weak by any means. The fruit flavors are more pronounced than the rest of the brew, but it seems to balance out in the end."
"D: This is an amazing beer and one that should be put on a pedastal for Belgium beers. This is a sipper and one that should be shared amongst friends over a fire in leather chairs smoking a stoggie. I would give this beer as a gift to anyone I truly cared about and share it with only those that could appreciate it."
"This is one of my favorite beers. This beer pours a very dark, brown, redish color with a small head. Smells sweet, you can smell the roasted malts. Taste's even sweeter. And being 10.5 % ABV, it's extremely drinkable. Does not taste like a 10.5 % beer at all so be careful with this one. This beer is definitely a special treat on ocasion type beer for me. I would enjoy this an hour or two after dinner for desert. Not for everybody, but give it a try. This is definitely one of the tastiest beer's I've ever had. I love it"
"Poured from 750ml bottle into tulip glass. Pours a bright copper colour with a beige head that's short lived. Nose is fairly subdued with hints of toffee, fruitcake and sweet malts, and the flavour is fairly similar, but less restrained. In the mouth brown sugar, caramel, apples and pears all join with the elements of the aroma to create a very nice, pretty unique (in my experience) quad that hides its alcohol well and doesn't cloy on the palate. One of my favorite Belgian strong dark ales that's usually widely available at any restaurant I go to."
"Drinkability: Very very good for such a large, complex beer. Very happy that I gave this one a try."
"This is a well made beer, but the alcohal is a little too up front for my taste. Worth trying and as a bonus a very cool bottle wrap."
"Gulden draak Ale was brown in color with good clarity ( the second pour left it a bit hazy). It had a bubbly light tan head with average retention and minimal lacing. The smell was malt, dark fruit, and a little alcohol. The taste was toasted malt, dried fruit, and yeast flavors and spices. It had long dry finish with noticeable throat-warming alcohol. It was medium-full in body with medium-high carbonation. Drinkability was good. This is a good Belgian Ale and worth trying out."
"I don't know about all this ""dark triple"" business. Kinda tastes like a dubbel or a light quadrupel. So can I brew a classic Belgian triple and call it a dubbel blonde?"
"Drinkability. A bit on the sweet side. One will do."
"Two finger head, with good lacing. Color is a 28 on the SRM beer color chart. Smell is enveloping, with aromas of coco, coffee, toffee, and caramel. Taste is a wonderful mixture of caramel, coffee, molasses, raspberries, apple, grapes, vanilla, black pepper, cinnamon, malt, and licorice. There are more flavors in there, but the more you taste the more buzz you get and flavors become muted. Rich, full body of heavy cream passes over my tongue and teeth, added with the wonderful prickly feeling of carbonation. This is one masterful brew which took many many years to perfect. I want more of this fine brew."
"Gulden Draak is a delicious beer, but a slow starter, and an even slower sipper. I would recommend letting it warm up a bit before partaking with any sort of diligence. The noticeable alcohol and aggressive effervescence make it a difficult beer to drink more than one of, but it definitely grows on you. It reminds me of Hair of the Dog's Adam, with a little more complexity, a lot more carbonation, and a slightly heftier price tag (though both are great values). Bottom-line: it's strong and a little scary, but I'll get it again."
"I expected something a bit more complex, but the beer is very drinkable. I can't decide if it should be grouped as a strong Dark Ale, dubbel, or dark tripel. Decent, but not my favorite of any of those styles."
"D: I could drink this all day. The alcohol isn't overpowering and the taste is very interesting."
"Small Duvel style bottle into a snifter. Pours a dark brown that really darkens up in the glass even more, pretty much opaque, with a generous energetic head. The nose isn't quite as funky and impressive as I was expecting. It's more malty than yeasty and quite sweet. It's also fairly sweet on the tongue and quite malty. The yeast does come through when drinking, and it's quite delicious. Perhaps the best beer I've had from Van Steenberge and certainly the heaviest."
"Drinkability: definitely a great choice for a dessert beer. At 10.5% abv, it is deceptively balanced. This is a little too sweet to drink much of."
"Extreme amount of head. The body was dark brown and was nearly opaque. Smelled like it should: malts with a slight hint of nutiness. Taste upfront was of fresh baked bread and lingered from the beginning until the sip was long gone. Although this is a sweet brew, it was balanced nicely with hop characteristics represented as a pecan/pine flavor."
"That being said the beer itself was good at best. A beer I'm glad I tried but there are many in the same style that are more unique or tasty."
"D- A really different brew that grew on me quite a bit as it warmed up."
"Drinkabilty - If it wasnt 10.5% alcohol id be higher. This was a strong bold and sweet drink i really enjoyed. I would actully drink two of these then for sure eat something next. It reminds me of a quad actually."
"D: A nice tasting brew and definitely one to at least try."
"This reminds me more of the quads I've had than other tripels."
"Drinkability: for a beer of this strength, it is scary how drinkable it is. You could sip these all night. However, I would not make it past two."
"D-I can't finish this. I'm used to drinking some high alcohol content beers but this one is just way too much of a mess. I hate it."
"Drinkability: An enjoyable beer with some good flavors. I could definitely see myself picking up some more of this brew."
"Drinkability: A lack of head retention is this beer's only fault. I could drink this just about everyday. Definitely world class."
"probably belgium's best non trappist beer."
"D/O- No way is this 10.5%abv. Entirely too drinkable. Definitley would sneak up on you if you let it. Very nice beer."
"D - Oh yes...just mentioned why it was so drinkable, great taste and not too heavy."
"Drinkability - Good beer, a little fruity for my taste. Heavy Alcohol weight, 10% ABV, so not a session beer. A nice winter warmer."
"Drinkability: difficult not to drink quickly. It's very tasty. Like, to the point where I want to take the bottle straight to the face. This may sound exaggerated but it's not. Don't believe me? Try it. If you don't like it, well, sorry. We all perceive these things differently. I just would be hard-pressed to find many people who really disliked this beer."
"Now this is beer!"
"I have to say that I am astonished by how well this flat, old beer tasted. I guess dragons don't lose much with age."
"D: A good beer, but not my favorite BSDA. Still, it's a solid beer and one I will continue to enjoy on occasion."
"D - Great flavours but far too sweet. A good beer nonetheless. A good dark strong Belgian ale. One of the first where I began to pick up dark fruit notes so it has a bit of nostalgic clout in my books. Mellow, smooth, boozy, and highly drinkable."
"D - This is a good beer and one worth a try. Sweet, but not cloyingly so. The ABV and the price are the biggest hindrances in the drinkablility. I would recommend it, if not just for the experience."
"Can't believe it's taken this long for me to try Gulden Draak."
"D: Definitely a sipper due to the abv and warming feeling in the taste. Good, solid beer for the winter. Surprisingly like a dubbel rather than a dark tripple (whatever that means, I am referring to the dark part of that style designation)."
"A nice slick beer. This was the 2006 vintage, enjoyed at Akkurat in Stockholm, Sweden. In company of great beers man stands small ..."
"drinkability; Too strong to be a session beer for sure, still easy to drink but the alcohol could be better hidden."
"Purchased as part of a 6 beer mix pack from the Control Board in Ontario. Pours a dark brown colour, with a hint of amber around the edges. Fairly thick off-white head, some mild lacing on the glass. Smells of brown sugar, molasses, dried fruit with the Belgian yeast. Flavour is quite sweet, though the alcohol is somewhat noticeable. High carbonation level. A nice dark Belgian ale."
"Reviewed 3-12-10"
"O - A little too sweet. It almost drinks like a desert beer (more ice-wine than port), but still delicious."
"No hint of the ABV, though the sweetness deters the drinkability. Middle of the pack."
"This beer was pretty good but not a real standout. Color was a dark amber with a dark head and low to medium carbonation. Aroma was typical for a quad, yeast, dark fruit, very little hops. The flavor as well had a lot of malty and dark fruit characteristics. Good if you like quads."
"The ABV is not completely hidden here, but at the same time it can be still be quite deceptive, especially at cooler temperatures. This is very sweet, but is a fantastic sipper and would maybe work well as a dessert-style beer. I'm having trouble deciding between this and Piraat for my favourite out of the brewery's mixed 6'er."
"D - Drinkability is moderate. The flavors are strong and smooth, but the sweetness is just a bit too much as I continue to drink. Pretty heavy bodied and a bit syrupy, it's a nice treat to start but a sugary at the end."
"The drinkability is decent but there's no getting around the 10.5% alcohol and the innate richness. Given that, though, it's about as drinkable as you could hope for."
"D- Sweet, sweet dessert. Delicious. If you like dark chocolate and black cherries you'll love this. The balance is elequant and the flavors bold yet subtle. Nothing is overpowering. Excellent beer. One to savor."
"The drinkability is there, but I feel as the beer warmed up the ABV became more noticeable, i was tempted to bring down my score because i drank the beer as I was writing this review, but in the end I decided no. Though have no fear the beer seems to taste better as warmed though as well. These like any high ABV beer can knock you on your ass, and this beer is pretty deceptive when still cold."
"I can't help but think that this would make a great beer to braise lamb with. I just might have to try that. Ultimately, this beer does what a dark tripel should do, it has the fruitiness and mild sweetness that a more traditional tripel should, but only with dark fruits and dark sugars. Quite unique IMO."
"D- This is an excellent beer, and one of my favorites from Brewery Van Steenberge. It presents a lot of character, and hides the ABV considerably well. I noticed very little heat even when looking for it. The only way I did notice was in the buzz it gave me. This is one of the ones that makes you sad when it's gone. I definitely plan to pick up more, and recommend everybody try it at least once."
"D - This is good Belgian, and one I'd gladly order again."
"drinkability - a sipper for sure, nice beverage that I would happily go to again"
"Pours a dark plum with two finger off white head.. some lacing.. aroma is dark fruits, candi sugar, prunes, spices and yeast.. taste is super sweet and heavy.. lots of dark fruit, dates, black cherry, spices and boozy alcohol. Mouthfeel is pretty good with plenty of carbonation to combat the sweetness. Drinkability is okay. Its a bit too boozy and sweet to drink more than one."
"The beer pours with a slightly tan head. The beer itself looks brown, and is almost impossible to see through. The smell of this beer has hints of malt and belgian candi sugar. The mouthfeel is heavy almost like a brown ale. The taste starts out sweet, and ends with the flavor of dates, maybe raisins? There is a sweetness to which im assuming is from belgian candi sugar. It would be interesting to find out the malt bill on this beer, I have a feeling there is maybe belgian biscuit malt? The beer is 10.5% abv, but you do not get any of the burning sensations from the alcohol."
"Drinkability - I can see why this beer is sold in a 330 ml bottle! The beer packs a punch, you can taste the liquor but also some amazing sweetness. I would have this beer again just not hunt it down."
"D- Paired great with my meal, also goes very well with desserts, mainly chocolate and orange flavored. Very drinkable and extremely tasty. Alcohol becomes a bit much after one bottle, but this is one of my all times favorites."
"Pours a nice dark brown colour with a nice head that stays forever :) Initial smells slightly fruity with a nice caramelized sweet malt and hops and alcohol. Tastes quite the same. Very nice finish and all around very distinct taste. Very nice beer, could go for another one but i would have to stop at two or three as the taste is not exactly my favorite style out there but it is definitely enjoyable and at 10.5% abv it sure makes for an enjoyable time. This is my first belgian strong dark ale and thanks to gulden draak im not afraid to explore it. good stuff!"
"Medium body. Very smooth and well balanced. A masterful big beer. Very drinkable in spite of the high ABV. You want more even though you know you shouldn't"
"Drinkability... well its enjoyable, but this is one hell of a beer. You only need one of these in the night, but its worth it."
"D-a really good beer. need to sip slowly and concentrate. as I said, this is a cognac tasting of beer. I love cognac so it fits perfect to my taste. I only wish it had a fuller mouthfeel and tasted less like syrup."
"O: very pleasantly surprised by this one! Never was appealed to the bottle, but once poured, loved it. This one isn't a fast drink, alcohol definitely is present. Will buy some more and see what a couple of month time will do"
"The taste was so good I wanted to chug this ale - but refrained as to really enjoy a really good brew - very drinkable."
"D- Very tasty beer. Alcohol is deceiving but I would drink this any time. I only briefly tasted this one but I plan on buying more in the near future. Would definitely seek this out."
"Very enjoyable, but the alcohol puts a damper on the drinkability. 1 is satisfying."
"As a ""dark tripel," Gulden Draak is a unique Belgian ale that makes for a great digestif...or nigthcap, in my case."
"Tasty!! A sweet treat, like a dessert to itself. I definitely enjoy this beer, but at this price and ABV, it's a sipper. Even after one, I could feel the warmth."
"This is a decent BSDA. The flavours are good, the alcohol well integrated and the finish dry enough not to be cloying. The aroma could be better but on the whole its decent."
"D: Sit back and enjoy 1... that will be all you need. At 10.5% ABV it is very strong. One and done. It is a very nice sit down and enjoy on a nice cool evening... Lots of great flavor and very warming.... it is almost like sipping a very nice cognac.... Give this one a try..."
"I'll be cellaring some (if I can bare it) to see how it does over time."
"I have mixed thoughts about this beer. It's just OK. The amount of candi sugar they put in this is overwhelming. I'd rather have more malt and less sugar so it didn't taste like cola, but as it is, it's drinkable...just not something I'm inclined to purchase again."
"Overall: Excellent beer overall. The flavor is near perfect. I would very highly recommend this."
"The explosive flavors of this tripel are so wonderful. Nothing I have tasted compares. This is not for the bud light drinker. This beer is only meant for those who appreciate quality and substance in their beers."
"A big, tasty treat here; complex, yet dangerously inviting, as the sweetness melds well with the alcohol. Reminiscent of a young Port wine, so obviously Gulden Draak is a perfect candidate to throw at just about any cheese that has a blue vein running through it."
"Still blown away @ how enjoyable this beer was. Smooth, flavourful, not overbearing in any category, yet makes me immediately wishing I had more in the cellar to enjoy."
"Pours a bright, deep gold bordering on amber with a nice white head. Smell has a bit of hops alongside some citrus and sweet, sweet malt. Taste is quite sweet as well with a good amount of grassy, floral hops to balance is out. The mouthfeel is quite full. Nice body without any real alcohol taste. Drinkability is on the high side. High in ABV, but quite delicious. This is a sipper."
"Drinkability: Very good, enjoyable, a solid example of a Belgian strong dark ale."
"Overall impression: tasty and sweet, this is an incredible beer. anytime. any day."
"poured from a 330 ml bottle to a mahogany color with a small head fresh tan collar and great lacing..smell was sweet currant dark fruit with caramel sugars roasted malts with nice yeast ..taste is sweet like a tripel big dark fruit tastes plum and fig its followed by roasted malts candied sugar yeast some clove and spice just delicious and gets better as it warms...mouth feel is full as in full of flavor alcohol is not detected its 10.5 but i never tasted it..its a beautiful brew as a strong dark it pricey but really good"
"Nicely balanced and a wonderful sipper. It's ABV is well masked. Savor and enjoy!"
"D: i liked it a bit more for sessions than Trois Pistole's from Unibroue. definately not an everyday for me, but two and three go down as easy as one... 4 is on the way, but i won't be right minded after all that 10.5 kicks in."
"D: Quite dangerous. Without knowing the number, I would guess this was 7-8% abv at most. Gulden Draak drinks impressively well for a 10%+ brew. Bravo!"
"D-this is a well balanced brew with plenty of sweetness but nice levels of complexity to keep this well balanced and very enjoyable. the alcohol is present in a good way and in no way shows the true power of this brew."
"Drinkability: Superb, I could have easily finished a 750 and will most certainly have this beer again."
"D: I could drink this every day for ever, if it weren't so hard to find. I plan on hunting this beer down for every special occasion."
"Drinkablility: I liked this beer a lot. Mouthfeel wasn't quite what I hoped, but definitely worth a try."
"drinkability: This beast is amazingly mellow."
"D: Would definately drink this again."
"A good beer - and I can see how others would love it. But not quite there for me."
"This is a beer that I used to recommend as a interesting and a bit unusual Belgian beer. But now when I think about it, it is not that special. Still an OK beer, though."
"D-- Very much a sipper. Quality sipper at that. Great nose and look but after a while the rum and cognac taste is very aggressive and overpowering. Also gets a bit sweet for my taste. Darned good beer though. Good nightcap though one is enough and hurts the drinkability of it, as one is all you need."
"A good sipping beer for an evening on the couch, in my case watching ""Clash of the Titans"" with the kids."
"D Very good complex beer, worth seeking out. I would have a hard time drinking two back to back, due to the alcohol, but the flavor was good. 4"
"jd"
"From the 11.2 fl. oz. bottle no. 01LI. Sampled on July 31, 2010. The pour is dark amber with a finger or so of foamy beige head that bubbles slowly down but hangs around for the full period. A nice smokiness erupts from the yeasty, malty aroma. The texture is on the chewy side and the taste combines a number of ingredients in a delightful way including malts, hops, and some kind of pepper-like dash that gives it a little bit of a punch. Very nice."
"This is a beer greater than the sum of its parts, it falls a bit short in some areas but makes up for it where it excels. A very tasty, very drinkable high alcohol Belgian ale, perfect for pairing with food as well."
"D - Nice sipping beer. Needs a touch more crispness, but a bit too sweet and alcoholic to be a real quaffer."
"This is a very nice beer, but the sweetness definitely limits my intake."
"Ran out of time to buy ale today and had to ""settle"" for this from the store. Didn't pour with much of a head and no real lace to speak of. Color is a grand amber with hints of red. Wonderful aroma of figs, candied yams, yet no alcohol which is surprising given the 10.5% ABV strength of this here brew. Flavor starts off incredibly robust - full of good maltiness, that awesome Belgian yeast, some alcohol that carries over into the finish. Not as complex as I would have hoped, but great flavor. Very robust as I said and pleasing. Finish is long and only slightly bitter. Pretty darn good but expensive at $4.40/11.2oz. bottle. If you see it try it"
"All in all truly an excellently brewed BIER!"
"drinkability: nice Belgian beer."
"Overall: this an excellent beer. It is a little to malty for me, but is still wonderfull. As a lover of tripel, I had to try this when I heard that it was a dark tripel. It would make a good alternative to port or sherry as an after dinner drink. Drink this one slow it is a whopper of a beer."
"I had a pint of this on tap at The Yardhouse. This is very, very strong beer. The aroma is crisp and strong, the beer itself sweet and tarty. The beer is definitely not smooth or for the faint of heart, but this is a great beer. High ABV and a strong sugary taste, not too sweet, not too bitter, but will definitely leave a strong aroma in your mouth"
"Back in the day, I was jazzed to try this beer because of the opaque white bottle. Good to see not much has changed. It pours a surprisingly clear garnet topped by a firm finger or more of ecru froth. The nose comprises figs, raisins, rye bread, strawberries, lightly roasted malts, and nutmeg. The taste follows pretty closely, with a blend of dark fruits interbreeding with caramel, toffee, rye bread, and a nice spice blend that I assume would make a good banana bread even better. Good times. The body is a hefty medium, with a moderate carbonation and feel that borders on the chewy, but never quite makes it (and that's not necessarily a bad thing here). Overall, a very nice brew, better than I remember it being."
"RBESG 2006 in Göteborg, Grand Tasting. 750 ml bottle, ABV is 11.5%. Chestnut colour. INTENSE sweet aroma of oak and fortified wine, spicy notes. Oaky and spicy flavour, warming mouthfeel as expected from an 11.5% ABV beer. No thirstquencher this one, but an interesting sipping beer."
"Drinkability- This beer is dangerous because you can hardly taste the alcohol at all. I've been drinking it over the course of this review, and my typos have increased substantially by this point. It is supremely drinkable and a wonderful experience. If only it were more affordable."
"Poured from an 11.2 ounce bottle into a tulip glass. Dark with a bit of orange. A small head with fine bubbles. Smells sweet and a little like figs. It tastes bigger than it smells with a syrupy richness and a thick feel that lingers but not in a bad way. Not too carbonated. Definitely drinkable. I would buy this again."
"Overall a very fine ale I would try again."
"Drinkability: Very good. Try it if you find it."
"this is some strong shit, and it doesn't hide it. I'm happy to sip a single 11.2 oz bottle; a 750 would be too much for me to finish in one sitting."
"Drinkability: hardly noticed the 10.5%. Dangerous brew. Very tasty. Worth seeking out."
"drinkable as hell, but be careful..."
"This is dangerously drinkable for such a potent bere. Full bodied and smooth, with just the gentlest of warming sensations from the alcohol."
"I considered giving it a 5 in drinkability even, though the alcohol content precludes the possibility of drinking a lot of it in one sitting."
"D: The alcohol content of this beer was very apparent in this brew's smell and taste. More so than the other styles I've had at comparable ABV. This is only something to keep in mind, not something to discourage me from buying more in the future. It had lots of great flavor and had a nice smell to it too. I enjoyed this and would buy more later. Wondering if a little age might dull down the aggressiveness of the alcohol here though, I will have to try later."
"Beer pours a dark brown with little to no head. I poured super slow so that may contribute to the head. When I first started to smell the beer was during the pour. The yeast was definatly present. In the tulip I got hints of bubble gum and some ripe bannanas. A little alcohol. At first drink I get a caramel malt over powering flavor. Mouth feel shows plenty of carbonation from the second fermentation. I then get lingering bubble gum as it finishes. The beer will compliment some grilled potatoes. I enjoyed this one."
"Overall a really nice example of the style and one worth having if you're a fan."
"I would whole-heartedly recommend this beer. It's very drinkable, is complex without being overbearing, and absolutely delicious. Well worth the $5 I paid for the bottle."
"The alcohol burn is made pleasant by the sweet fruitiness and I can see this beer really taking you for a ride that would require bail money and really good friend. Careful with this one! It warns you up front that it's potent, but the flavors make you forget that immediately."
"Summary - This was the beer that got me into drinking beer for the taste of it. I never really knew what beer was until I tried this on tap. After this, my affection for fine beers has grown immensely. If you haven't tried Gulden Draak, do yourself a favor and have some."
"D: Very smooth and could be a session beer if judged on taste alone, but the 10.5% ABV could cause some problems."
"I'll buy this again."
"Adding the yeast left in the bottle to the last third of the drink seems to mellow some of the flavors."
"enters the mouth light and tart, almost champagne like. i get the malt first but then there is a smooth velvety feel in the mouth as the fruit flavors are released. taste like a typical belgian tripel but leaves something on the palate i cant quite recognize. finishes very nicely"
"Not sure how these ratings will calculate out, but I'd call it a B+."
"RECOMMENDED"
"D: the high ABV makes it less drinkable for me; the 330 size helps and I had to drink this very slowly; but I must admit it's more drinkable than I expected at the first sip."
"D - This is a very well-made beer. I just found myself wishing it had a little more complexity and maybe was more cloying! Can a beer this flavorful be faulted for being too drinkable? I find it hard to argue that point. If the carbonation was higher more characteristics might come out."
"D-its quite nice; the lingering aftertaste is quite nice; one is enough for the evening and it's a bit pricey"
"D- This beer is good but nothing special. I think it is a bit too much money."
"This is a great example of an excellent Strong Belgian Ale. It is a beer that should be appreciated with a great dinner and should be paired with a meal with strong flavors (gamey meats, meat or fish topped with a sweet sauce or smoky flavors)."
"D- Not very drinkable due to the combination of high alcohol and high sweetness. One bottle of this every once in a while more than does the job."
"Nick"
"Man, I love this beer. Rich and malty, smooth and easy. A real creeper of a beer. You don't know its 10% while you're drinking it, but in 10 minutes..."
"Corked bottle. Brownish amber color with a tan fine bubbled head. Fine bubbled lace trails behind the liquid in sheets but always leaves some splotches behind. Smell is sweet and dark fruits up front. Plums come to mind. First taste was beet sugar sweetness but the more complex fruit flavors push to the front. Heavy carb level gives this one a smooth mouth. I think this helps hide the ABV. Some of the alcohol shows itself in the slightly burning finish. Across the board 4.0 good beer. Nothing outstanding but nothing lacking either."
"Not-so-simply-put, this beer is a Druggernaut of boose, malt, and complexity. I just bought a four pack of this stuff to age, and of course I had to get a single to drink now. The smell is of caramel, toffee, and butter scotch. It's intensely rich, and very complex. I can't wait to get into some of these years down the road. Warms the soul as well as the brain. Truly one of the world's great beers. When I die, I hope to be embalmed with Gulden Draak."
"this one was poured from tap into a gulden draak goblet with a two and a finger long lasting foamy head. deep rich amber, and pleasant slightly caramel nose. very smooth, malty, brown / belgian sugars way up front and the high abv was all but not noticed until well afterward."
"An amber and light brown with reddish highlights that more than one surprise. A fruity nose that also draws on toasted malt. The palate, meanwhile, is soft and caramelized (we note the presence of typical Belgian candy sugar), slightly vinous with discrete traits acids and presence alcoholic noticeable but not intrusive. Some point to the body of the beverage as tiramisu. The finish gives the pungent bitterness and alcohol, but as a rule, the ABV beer is not felt and it is only beneficial."
"D: It's rather drinkable and the alcohol is hidden very well, although you really need to sip this beer because it's strong."
"Pours a dark copper/rusty/ruby brown with about a finger of off-white head. The scent is a mix of pepper, alcohol, spice, and dark dried fruits. The first scent is fruity (dates, plums, and bananas) which are quickly joined by alcohol finishing with spice. For me the scents seemed to be in stages. The taste was much of the same other than a slightly different order. Dark fruits and spice on the front coming in front of a wet bready malt. The alcohol finishes things off and lingers for a bit. Pretty dry finish. Sweet, but not overdone by any means. This is a pretty solid ale and one of my favorite styles."
"D : The unique flavor and 10.5% ABV keeps this from being overly session-able. The dark fruit flavors and dry finish make this a specialty brew for specific occasions and pairings."
"Mouthfeel is good, tiny tingly carbonation, not to sticky or thick. Does not taste like 10.5% alc."
"(Bottle into tulip -- Sampled 2/21/10) Pours a clear dark brown with a small creamy head the stuck around with beautiful lacing through the glass. Nose is heavy with the molasses sweetness of the malts as well as a macerated fruit smell, chiefly of plums, dates, apples, banana, etc. Full bodied in the mouth, as advertised, the carbonation is just right to allow all the fruit notes to pop on the tongue and really develop. As expected with this style, the banana and spice dominate, and the alcohol is very very sneaky. At 10.5% this could be a very good or very bad thing, depending on what you are looking for! Easily one of the best I have tried so far this year."
"Stubby 330ml brown bottle that is powder coated with a white (paint?) in a clever way to both prevent the light from intruding and make the bottle immediately recognizable. Pours a clear amber color with more than 2 fingers of somewhat yellowish/tan stained head. Significant amount of lace clings to the glassware and the head retains fairly well. Continuous bubbles rise to the surface in support of the head. Nose is fruity sweet and quite pleasant with the malt character being a mix of something like caramelized raisins and a bit of nuttiness with alcohol coming through from the back and a faint touch of hops make themselves known in a partially grassy way. Taste has a big alcohol presence that is somewhat solvent and quite warming. Upfront the flavors of malty sweetness meet the bittering hops and are eventually overtaken by the big alcohol character. Alcohol reigns supreme throughout the tasting experience with notes of caramelized malt sweetness and slight bitter hops in the finish. There is a lingering taste left in the mouth that is a mix between the lingering alcohol, caramelized malt sweetness and hop bitterness all fighting for the attention/last impression left in your mouth. Feel of this big beer is medium with a moderate amount of carbonation that fits the bill perfectly. Clearly a sipper, it is strangely drinkable for how much alcohol presence is displayed."
"It poured out a hazy amber color with plenty of carbonation topped with a thick light tan and bubbly head with some light lacing. It has a mild bourbon aroma along with some smoked malts and an earthy plant smell is hidden behind everything. It has a medium-to-light body and is quite crisp on the tip of the tongue; slightly bitter overall. There is a strong roasted malt flavor mixed in with a little hops. It is sweet overall and has a slightly dry, alcohol aftertaste...I will be buying this one again."
"Overall Impression: This is a funky, complex beer, just like me, except with more alcohol! If you find this beer...DRINK IT!"
"D: easy sipper, easy drinker. a great Belgian to start with, i believe it was my first almost a year ago."
"Overall: The mouth feel is creamy, carbonated, and slightly astringent. The body is medium with a medium finish. This is a really good beer, I enjoyed it."
"D- Worthwhile to keep a few of these little bottles around for decadent cravings."
"Overall a really good beer. This is one of my favorite styles, and this is a great example of why. Nicely balanced taste, and just a really good beer. I expect to be buying more of this in the future."
"Sweet and a little yeasty. Sour cranberry and grape flavors up front then some orange and a tiny bit of ripe banana. Big caramel malt and mellow spicy hops. Alcohol is right out there but for some reason still seems very balanced. Finishes with some toffee."
"D - Goes down easy,"
"D: A tasty, fruity Belgian Strong Dark."
"Drinkability: I wouldn't pick up this beer again. The nose had me excited and ready to dive in, but the combination of yeast, alcohol and dark fruit was a combination of flavors that just wasn't very attractive to my palate."
"D – This beer will tank you; it is super strong and tastes like candy…"
"When I drank it, there was little to no head when poured. The taste is strong, and somewhat sweet. Color is dark, more so than a brown ale, but not quite what you'd get from an Imperial Stout."
"Poured from a white 11.2 oz. bottle. Has a dark brown color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of dark fruits and alcohol. Taste is good, fruit and spice, some alcohol. Feels full bodied in the mouth and has decent drinkability. Overall this is a high quality brew."
"Pours a nice hazy ruby-amber color with sandy head. Nice lacing, beautiful color. Nose is fruity, with cherries, raspberries, and a bit of yeastiness. Taste follows with some good grape, cherry, raspberry, and malt flavors. A really good BSDA, though I'm not convinced that it's better than the cheaper offerings from Unibroue. Delicious as it warms, cloves and other spices come out. Very smooth MF, though a bit thin, could be creamier for my tastes. Very drinkable, had no idea this was a 10.5% beer. Great one, worth picking up."
"Notes: Would be a great dessert beer, especially on a cold winter night. Fairly sweet and alcoholic, with a good amount of warming."
"Verdict: Try this beer."
"* = ideas from fellow taster"
"one of the fullest bodies I've had in a beer. A bit subdued in the carbonation department."
"not a huge fan of belgian beers but i'd give this one another shot. pretty complex beer with a good amount of layers in the smell + taste. well done."
"Overall, an excellent beer."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, but the alcohol is pretty upfront. Put one down and felt the alcohol when I got off my stool."
"D - Very smooth and easy going dark ale. ABV is extremely well hidden and not noticed at all. Excellent ale overall and would love to drink more in the future."
"NO ME GUSTA !"
"D: Very high. This feels sessionable but if treated so would be a time-bomb. Be warned!"
"D: extremely drinkable. You would never know that it was 10.5 percent if you didnt read the label. Its super smooth and only gets better the more you drink."
"D: Very good despite of the high ABV. Very ""Belgium"" dark ale. Strongly recommend"
"Serving type: bottle"
"I had passed this by many, many times, despite the beautiful bottle, being under the assumption it was a golden triple which isn't one of my favorite styles. Really glad I tried this, Gulden Draak is incredible, highly recommended. Great depth, evolves tremendously with temperature. Not your average Tripel by any means."
"Mellow alcohol, but overpowering sweetness hinders drinkability. Some additional bitterness, especially in the finish, would have been a nice touch."
"The beer is well carbonated, medium bodied and the flavors balance each other fairly well. This one is a little hot, I have definitely had strong darks at 10% that were a little less harsh, but this one is good."
"Long finish. Active carbonation. Good alcohol burn. Good drinking Belgian. Recommended."
"Rich mahogany brown in colour and slightly hazy. A fingers worth of off-white head quickly fizzles away, leaving some lace on the glass and a thin covering of bubbles over the body. The sweet smell of caramelized sugar and toasted bread is complimented nicely by cherry and plum. Dried fruit flavour shows notes of prune and raisin with a sprinkling of brown sugar. Much less cherry than the scent suggests. There's the slightest hint of pepper. Starts semisweet before drying out with a kick of booze and floral hops in the finish. Medium bodied with prickly carbonation. The effervescence makes it feel very light and airy on the tongue. Some beers glide across the palate, this floats. This a wonderful beer, and I wish it was available to me year round. Delicious."
"Medium body with a weak but soft carbonation."
"Will buy again."
"D: Nice flavorful beer. Fairly complex. ABV limits drinkability a bit, but well worth a shot."
"The body is on the lighter side of heavy, has a slight prickliness on the tongue, and incredibly drinkable. I could sit and have a few of these and easily lose track of the number. For a beer I've never heard of before, I'd definitely buy this one again - worth checking out."
"Drinkability: A strange beer, and I can't say I'm a fan of the candy malt. Not much depth in this, but still worth a try- I seem to be an exception."
"A superb example of a dark Belgian ale, this is probably one of the better I've had in my day. Quite complex yet still very drinkable despite the high level of alcohol and the interplay of flavors. I must admit that my pleasure was dampened a bit due to a full stomach, but undoubtedly this would be even more enjoyable on a different occasion. Certainly world class."
"Overall, a fantastic BSDA. I enjoyed this more than Chimay's Grand Reserve, and I really liked that beer. Without a doubt this beer is sweet but at the same time, it's excellently balanced, creamy, full flavoured, and the sweetness is not cloying. I'm already buzzing and I haven't even finished the bottle. The alcohol is a real creeper, so beware. Highly recommended."
"Poured into a tulip glass. Color is deep brown with redish highlights when held up to the light. Smell is thick, dark fruity sweetness...plum...raisin, a little alcoholic...bourbony. Taste is very nice, very much like its smell. Dark fruitiness, mostly plum like... sweet and sour. One of the more flavorful BSDA's I've had. Alcohol is noticeable but not overwhelming. It's full bodied. It's a mouth full. This feels like a meal. Drinkability is good. It's pretty thick and flavorful, so it's a sipper, but an enjoyable sipper. It's just a little too sweet and syrupy for me to want to try again."
"Drinkability: A decent beer. Not the greatest example of a Belgian beer that I've had but not bad nonetheless. It's worth a try but not something that I'll seek out time and again."
"This beer is fantastic, it has a nice frothy/foamy head, that dissipates with great lacing. It pours out, thick, dark and like chocolate but without the favor of chocolate of course. This beer is excellent, it did not let me down. Good favor, all around good beer. Sweetness, but not too sweet or overwhelming. One of the best Belgian beers I have ever had. To beer lovers this is Gold."
"D- a nice sipper drink. Downing this too quickly will result in ending up on the floor. Very nice flavor and smell makes it nice to put down at a slow yet steady pace."
"yummy."
"D: With all the great flavors, this isnt one you can drink a lot of. One is perfect..."
"Feels like a holiday beer to me. Like Sammy Smith's Stingo it's sweet spices, rich texture and dark fruits make it a fantastic compliment (a definite dessert possibility) to a great feast of beef, potatoes and Christmas pudding. I love it!"
"When my finances allow this beer will be a regular part of my beer rotation. As it stands it will make for an enjoyable time to time treat. Smooth and tasty."
"D: So smooth and easy going for a 10.5% beer"
"After reading some other reviews I am thinking I got a bad bottle or something for most of you are saying this has alot of carbonation and I barely got any of that. Ah well."
"Poured a 11.2oz stubby into my Bell's tulip. This beer pours a dark, prunish brown with a massive, three inch, beige cap that leaves sticky lacing all the way down the sides of the glass. The aroma reminds me first of dark fruits. Hints of ripe, red apple, sour cherries, plum and just a bit of prune. Carmel and toffee come out in the middle of the nose with just a hint of Belgian candy sugar at the finish of the aroma. The flavor is rather vinous to me. Grape jelly, apple and just a bit of prune come through. To me, it reminds me of a sweet wine, where the grapes flavor is very concentrated, like an ice wine. Big sweet malt notes dominate the middle of the flavor profile and it finishes with just a hint of booze mixed with brown sugar. They really do a wonderful job at covering the 10.5% alcohol. As it warms, sour cherry notes really start to dominate. The mouthfeel is light for as dark as the beer is. I understand, it's a stereotype that darker beers are normally heavier in body, but this one really surprised me. The carbonation is crisp and fits really nicely with the body. All in all, this is a really good beer. I'm sure it won't be the last time I drink it."
"Pours a dark reddish brown with a huge off white head with huge fat lacing. Smells like apples yeast banana with good amount of spice. Taste is the same with a bit of alcohol comin through. Mouthfeel is subpar with weak carbonation. Very drinkabe for the abv."
"D - A little too sweet for my palate, but it's got an excellent complex flavor."
"Quite good, but unlike any beer I've had; BSDA, Tripel, or other. If it looks like a duck, smells like a duck and tastes like a duck; is it a wine, I mean a duck? Who cares, it is impressive."
"A unique Belgian style beer in that it is very dark and full bodied. Rich, creamy head that lingers in the glass and holds together well. The taste has a interesting blend of pepper and fruit. The richness and complexity of the pepper is balanced by the dried fruit taste that lingers longer than the peppery flavor. An easy beer to drink and a credit to the Belgian Tripel class. Highly recommend!"
"Sweet and malty to start and the volatiles from the ABV bring out some of the fruity complexities of the yeast. Notes of strawberries and cherries."
"A bit strong to toss back, but certainly a tasty beer."
"Cool looking white bottle with a pissed off dragon on the label. Pours a dark hazy brown with a thin, sticky head. The smell is amazing. Spicy pepper, sweet prune, medicinal herbal tea with an almost menthol quality. Earthy, leathery with a bourbon like alcohol burn. This is some harsh stuff. I get a warm boozey alcohol burn at first, then a ton of different flavors come out. Sweet and tart cherries, black pepper, spicy, earthy, oak notes. Green tea with lemon grass. There is some understated hop bitterness. Lots going on. It's 10.5 abv, but it drinks more like a good 80 proof bourbon. This is for sipping. I can't imagine the skill that must go into brewing something like this. My hat's off to the the Belgian craftsmen responsible for creating an amazing drink."
"Amazingly drinkable, great, well balanced beer - a great combo between bitter, fruity and malty. wow!"
"D: Like a lot of Belgians, this one conceals its ABV extremely well. You don't feel it until you stand up. Extremely tasty beer, one that I wish were more widely available in my area"
"In one way I like the over-the-top heavy sweetness, which is good for a long winter's night of sipping. But for the style, I prefer something a little drier and lighter in body. So I'm torn even though I dig it. Either way this is not for the feint of heart."
"Reddish brown color with a 2 finger off white head with large bubbles and decent lacing. Smell is dark fruit, especially plums. raisins, and cherries, as well as sweet caramel malt. Same for the flavor which mixes sweet malt with some bitterness to make a pretty nice beer. Creamy, full bodied, and nicely carbonated. The only drawback is the alcohol is not hidden, and packs quite a punch at 10.5%. Still quite good though."
"This was my first taste of a Dark Triple therefore I have nothing to compare it to, it was decent, more fruity than I was ready for though."
"I had this on tap and it was poured into a Gulden Draak tulip glass. It is a dark amber/brown color with a beautiful thick, creamy head. The nose was kind of weak, but consisted of raisin, alcohol, and very malty. The taste was pretty good and got better as it warmed. There was a lot of raisin, very malty, with a nice spiciness. I could feel the alcohol on the back of my throat. It seemed almost too sweet. The mouthfeel was pretty syrupy with a touch of carbonation. The sweetness cuts into the drink ability of this beer, not to mention its high alcohol content. However, if I wasn't driving I could have had at least one more of these before trying something else. This beer does not match up with Chimay Grande Reserve in my opinion, but overall I was very pleased to try this beer and would like to have it again."
"I have had this beer prior to reviewing it. Last year my mom bought me a bottle for Christmas, and I liked it, but that was before I was really into beer. So I decided to revisit it and I was not disappointed."
"Pours a hazy, dark amber color. 3/4 inch head of a pale tan color. Great retention and good lacing. Smells of hops, sweet malt, yeast, dark citrus, alcohol, and slight bread. Fits the style of a Belgian Strong Dark Ale. Mouth feel is smooth and crisp with an average carbonation level. Tastes of dark citrus (cherries), sweet malt, hops, yeast, and slight alcohol. Overall, a good body, blend, alcohol is well-hidden, and good aroma."
"Overall a nice Belgian that I was happy to try on tap. A great beer that everyone should have the opportunity of trying. Well done."
"Gulden Draak is deceptively easy drinking -- watch out for that 10.5% ABV -- but first rate nonetheless. One of my favorites."
"D: A big, complex beer. This is definitely worth trying. Drinkability is high, as this is a unique brew, but the sweetness and alcohol make it a slow sipper. A malty, hoppy, dark tripel."
"D- A little goes a long way, a nice treat from time to time, but the alcohol content will hold me back."
"Drinkability - I think one in a row of these would be the max. Certainly a nice evening drink, sit back watch a movie or read in front of a fire-place. This would be the perfect beer to warm you up."
"D - The alcohol of this beer does kill some of the exotic flavors you find. The first gulp was magically delicious, a real candy store of smells and tastes, however the last few sips were not as good. However this is a beer that stands out among most."
"Drinkability: Well, its pretty good, not great. I'm not a real fan of the strong booziness in this style, or the sourness (although its slight). I would drink it again if given to me, but I wouldnt buy it-- there are better choices for the money."
"I wouldn't ever turn this beer down when offered, but from now on I will definitely make sure to drink it after it's been out of the fridge for an hour. That's when it moves from being just a strong and interesting beer to one that is smooth and enjoyable."
"D- Great aroma and wonderfully rewarding and complex initial taste are brought to an excellent alcohol warmth and hop climax. However, the finale is a disappointing alcohol dominance, with malt and yeast flavors almost completely masked. Initial nirvana seems acheived, then abruptly shattered."
"D- love this belgian ale. only got better as the beer warmed. could drink one every night and never tire of the complex flavor profiles."
"How could I turn down the fierce clawing dragon tap-head? A nice pour from the Independent, definitely now one of Boston's best beer joints (thanks Evan!). A dark reddish smooth pour with fine bubbles settled to a thin head that soon dissipated. A sweet malty caramel aroma, and similar flavor, with yeasty honey qualities, sweet dark plums and anise. The alcohol (10.5%) is not hidden, but rather pointed out by the sweetness, although there is enough tartness to balance. Smooth and creamy, but not so much as to have more than one, this dragon is best sipped by a fireplace on a cold rainy night."
"Overall, I really wanted to give this a little bit of a higher rating, but it just has a few things I had to knock off points for."
"This i a really good consistant beer. I've enjoyed it every time I've had it. It's not something I keep around but It's one that I like going back to. The taste is malty and sweet without being cloying. This is not a beer I'd drink a lot of only because a little goes a long way."
"Overall: An exceptional beer! I have some serious reserve on beer claiming >10% ABV, but this one is a gem. Complex and full of flavours. very nice beer for a late evening drink."
"D- It didn't last long for me but I was a little light-headed after. One at a time people, if it's the size I had."
"Loved every minute of it!"
"I still have a few more bottles of this in the fridge and I will enjoy then as a good session beer."
"DrinkabilityL: My bottle has a bit of age on it so the hops that others have tasted are somewhat muted in my sample; nevertheless, this is a very fine Strong Dark"
"D - Average-plus."
"Tasty for sure... not an overwhelming alcohol presence at all. Very very solid beer but not a top 5 brew."
"D: Pretty solid beer, good complexity lots of little avenues of taste to explore with each sip, but I prefer others in this style over this beer and the mouthfeel knocked off some points in the drinkability department as well, but other than that, this beer is worth a look."
"Drinkability? Triple red flag warning for extremely, dangerously, fantastically drinkable. This beer fucking rocks. Wish it were less expensive. Lotta nickels for this one!"
"D - Very complex and enjoyable."
"One of classic Belgian Strong Dark Ale examples."
"Sweet, soft and yeasty finish. Sharp and a bit awkwardly over-carbonated (think Pepsi instead of Coke). Well-balanced for a sweet Belgian and very yeasty on the back end, with a surprisingly supple finish."
"A sipper, but not like a super thick cordial. This one can go down faster than expected, although at $5.80 for less than 12 oz., it won't be a six-pack weekend for me. Just loved this one. Well made and well overdue for me to try."
"Drinkability is a bit low just because there is so much going on, it'll kill your pallet pretty damn fast."
"D -- Definitely very drinkable, for a beer with a high alcohol content, this is very easygoing. A repeat purchase is in order."
"The flavor of this beer is very odd to me. It definitely is distinct. I do enjoy it though. The other areas do not impress me."
"D - One of my first forays into Belgian ales; it certainly challenged my palate. Complex & highly enjoyable. I would like to visit this one again."
"M/D: Nice full body with a generous amount of carbonation. This one is bottle conditioned, however I did not see much yeast toward the end, only a few black specks. The high amount of alcohol present takes away from it's drinkability."
"This beer is almost dangerously drinkable.. The ABV is fairly well-hidden under layers of surprisingly complex sweetness. Yummy."
"D - This is a pretty solid Belgian ale. Great flavors and aromas."
"Tonight having one of these with a year of bottle age.  It has held up well and if anything is a bit smoother and rounder with such things as the fruit and chocolate flavors/note becoming more well integrated and less isolated from each other.  Definitely a safe bet for holding onto for a least a year."
"Drinkability: good flavor but it's more of a slow sipper."
"2.5 not that it's bad beer, but it's hard to find under all that solvent."
"OVERALL: One of the better dark Belgian ales I've ever had. Would definitely recommend you give it a try."
"Drinkability- Strong, unique, One is enough."
"Drinkability- even though its 10 percent alcohol you cant even notice it a damn bit, so enjoyable and well balanced, a definite sipper and a great after dinner beer, its creamy sweet and delicous search it out, I got this 4 pack for 9.99 I feel I got the deal of the century, yummy."
"never judge a beer by the cover this beer was surprisingly delicious! im gonna try the vintage next which im hoping is a lil hoppier! although this one packed the hopps and weighhing in at 10.5% is no joke this is on my x mas list and the price being a lil steep but you pay for what ya get most of the time"
"D - Above average. I wouldn't mind another."
"D - enjoyable flavors, but the medicinal taste is overbearing"
"One of my favorites, easy to drink, so much personality to offer, and far too easy to enjoy."
"The Rochefort 6 is my measuring stick for all these styles, and while this one is tasty, I wish it had a little more Jesse the Body Ventura than Jesse the Mind Ventura."
"Dark amber color with a smooth beige head. Smells mostly of spices with a hint of semi-sweet fruit. Taste matches the aroma only that the alcohol starts to kick in as the beer warms up. As a tripel, very drinkable; creamy and heavy but a sipper as it should be."
"Poured out of the white bottle into a Leffe goblet. Light tan head that quickly faded, with minimal lacing. Nose of dark fruit, some spice, some alcohol, but all very faint. Taste was stronger with some sweetness. Definitely a smooth mouthfeel, but a heavy hitter at 10.5%. Overall a good beer, but could use a little more of that sweet aroma."
"A nice offering of the BSDA style, definitely worth a try"
"You do tatste and feel the alcohol well before finishing a bottle"
"The somewhat lifeless look and aroma are very deceiving, the taste and mouthfeel are superb. Incredibly drinkable too, I'm kicking myself for waiting so long to finally try this beer."
"I gently pour the squat white bottle into my glass and out pours a dark brown-redish liquid with minimal head. The scent is unbelievably sweet. It smells like cotton candy with a hint of scotch. That's a good thing. The flavor is very spicy. Sweet orange juice flavors with a caramel tone. I can tell it's 10.5 abv but it's not offputting. The mouthfeel is lighter then I expected with lots of carbonation. I'm halfway through my glass and I'm already feeling warm all over. This beer will kick your ass if you don't pay attention. A sipper for sure."
"Poured this 330 into my chimay glass. Dark bronze color, head is was kind of weak and hard to produce, almost like soda fizz, retreated quickly. Carbonation slowly trickles to the top. Fruity raisin-like and a bit of alcohol in the nose. Alcohol is prevelant in the beginning, as it warms and the flavors come out it is masked a bit more. It tastes like what it is: a dark tripel. Almost like ""hey, you got your dubbel in my tripel"". Fruity flavors. Mouthfeel is enjoyable, it doesn't fizz away immediately like the head. Solid beer, maybe not for one of the hottest days this summer so far, but I will return to the one in the future."
"Particular and quite decent one, but there is an undefinable something that I dislike in this beer. One at a time is enough."
"D: higher ABVs slightly hidden. Good belgian, very good drinkable strong dark."
"What can I say about this beer that hasn't already been said. 11.2 oz bottle served in a goblet. Beer is dark brown, nearly black, nice head, steady carbonation. Beautiful ether smell associated with strong Belgians. Taste is sweet and balanced alcohol. No hint of roasting in the flavors, except maybe slightly. One of my all time favorite beers. Excellent, you have to try this beer."
"Complex brew, and a lot of flavor in this little bottle! It's sweet, even cloyingly so, and the ABV isn't very noticible but will effect its potential as a session beer. Will definitely come back to this one."
"Very nice beer to sip and savor."
"I had never seen this beer until trying it last night (Flying Saucer was giving away the tulip with a purchase, natch). I'm glad that I was able to discover it for myself. It really is a great beer."
"This was a beer that greatly impressed me with the first sip, but the more I sipped, the less impressed I was. Plenty of flavour, enough complexity and quite easy to drink for the strength. Much better than the likes of Leffe, but a little oversweet, not quite up with the best. Still a must try for anyone who likes Belgian ales. Best when quite cool (perhaps 10 degrees celcius) to avoid the sticky sweet finish."
"Bravo!"
"I got to try this treat at the local BJ's restaurant. The waitress gave me the bottle with a glass to pour it into myself. Very nice of her. Poured a dark tea like brown with a small pillowy head. At first sniff I get that nice Belgian triple aroma of figs, black cherry, brown sugar, and a hint maple syrup. The taste was wonderfully complex with swirls of fig, caramel, spice, and baked apples with a mild alcohol finsh. very nice."
"Overall really enjoyed this and definitely something I want on rotation. Normally I'd say the sweetness would take away from the drinkability for me but rather than be balanced with a bitterness it was successfully toned down with a herbal earthiness so really just an all round winner in my books."
"D - I don't know about you, but I can't put back too many 10.5% beers in a night without getting sloppy and slow. That said, this would be the beer I'd get tanked on if that was my goal..."
"Gulden Draak pours out steaming from this very cool white-washed 750 ml bottle which masks the beast's secret! Dark brown with fiery red accents. I was shocked to see the bottle say ""tripel"" and have it pour out dark brown as I am used to seeing tripels in their traditional golden color. very nice looking rocky brown head about that took up about half my my tulip glass. This beer smells fiery peppery and fruity. Taste overwhelms the palate at first and is hot and spicy throughout with some serious alcohol and flavor. Substantial body and did I mention it is a spicy brew that really warms you up. Good stuff here."
"A fantastic beer that I will be revisiting again in the near future."
"***Note: second half poured into unibroue tulip and the head was MUCH improved. Big 4 inch head and it made the aroma stand out much more as well. Scores have been updated respectively."
"D- I must have been in a good mood this night... all I wrote for overall impressions in my notes was ""Great!!!."" This one was very satisfying and the bottle is pretty neat too... looks good with the growing collection above my doorway. (Decorating tip: door + crown molding + hot glue = awesome bottle displaying potential). I chose this beer to make a clone of... currently in fermentation. I'm sure it won't be as good, but should be interesting to compare."
"D - Very drinkable, it never shows its alcohol or becomes cloying. The malt character is complex and spectacular. I really can't come up with anything critical to say about it. A very nice example of the style and much more drinkable than most."
"D - easy to finish the 750 by myself, not sure i want another though. the abv is kinda high, and the taste is just too damn rich. the 750 was a perfect night cap though."
"An interesting beer that appears to defy classification."
"11.5 oz bottle. Poured a dark chocolate with a very small creamy head. Aroma of figs, brown sugar, and hops. Alcohol subdued for a 10.5%. Accents of cherries, bread, bleu cheese, and brown sugar. A magnificent beer, and a meal in itself. Thicker than a normal triple. Would probably very nicely compliment a piece of fresh bread and a nice salty piece of gorgonzola or stilton."
"Served: in an oversized wine glass."
"OVERALL: Definitely a good brew. This bottle might be a few years old, which sometimes hurts the head on a Belgian, but the nose and taste have matured quite nicely. The palate is a bit thin and airy, which holds it back a little bit, but non-the-less, this one is certainly worth checking out."
"Drinkability- very drinkable, really enjoyable, intend on drinking it again"
"Taste, at warmer temps is rich. Sweet yet rich in flavors, so much going on here. Nice brown ale type of flavor but with some spice. Mouthfeel was good; nothing incredible but goog. Drinkability is good IMO, especially with food (meat, pizza). Very delicious, but packs a punch."
"I would highly recommend this beer to anybody."
"D: close to average in drinkability; strong ABV"
"D- A bit of a sipper, but very enjoyable."
"BB June 7/09. One finger tan head on the pour, sits atop a dark rust coloured brew. The head gently subsided to a cloudy, splotchy consistency with moderate carbonation and lacing. Smell is sour fruit, black cherry, pumpernickel loaf. Sour and sweet notes alternate with dark fruit, prune tort, bitter sour aftertaste. Mouthfeel is lively with a bit of tartness and malt backbone that comes through in the finish but is overshadowed by the sweet and sour mix. When cold, the alcohol is hardly noticeable but with air and warming there is a cherry brandy quality with enhanced sweetness although the sour kick also sticks around. This is not only very tasty but also very interesting for anyone with an interest in beer."
"D - Very good stuff. All the sweetness and breadiness make for an extremely complex flavor profile, and the mouthfeel accentuates this fact in addition to making the brew go down ultra smooth. Another top notch beer from our friends in Belgium."
"D: Quite good, especially considering the strength."
"M + D: That big, sparkling presence that I love in a good Belgian style. A little bit of tackiness, more oily, really. I found myself sipping away at it quite briskly, but that alcohol content does deserve a little bit of respect and modesty. An excellent beer all around, and certainly something I see myself indulging in again."
"Highly charged carbonation does not quit, tiny bubbles dance upward the entire quaff duration. Damn fine frosty."
"One great beer and a must for just about anyone"
"D - Better once it warms up, you get more of the body and fullness to offset just the sweet."
"D - I rated average on drinkability. It goes down without a fuss, but I certainly couldnt gulp it. This is a very good beer overall and I wouldn't turn one down if it were offered to me, but its not something I will be stocking in my cellar."
"Easy drinking, powerful, and delicious."
"This beer poured an opaque brown with a single-finger tan head. The smell is some bready malt with some dark fruit and spices. The taste starts off with some great thick malt that gives way to a bit of candied orange peel and peppery spiciness that compliments the alcohol on the back end. The mouthfeel is thick with some moderate carbonation and some warming from the alcohol. This is a surprisingly drinkable beer for one that's so big and complex. Definitely one of those milestone beers that you end up comparing others to down the line."
"this feels like velvet on my tongue"
"Great flavor, but at 10.50%ABV, this one will put you down, quick. More of a dessert brew, anyway. It's super-tasty, but slightly on the sweeter side of things."
"D- easy for a while then gets slightly harder."
"unfortunately the carbonation lets this beer down. best before date is about a year away so guessing they give this beer five years from bottling that makes this one four years old. mayeb too much time conditioning? i shared a bottle of this with my bro-in-law (think it was a larger bottle, not the 330ml) and it was fantastic. this one has been about two notches down from what i remember."
"Meh. OK but not life changing bu then again I didn't think it would."
"This is a great beer. It has a wide range of flavours. It's strong though, and the alcohol is present, not making it a beer for all occasions."
"Drinkability- Though the ABV is up there, I think this is one beer that I couldn't resist a second or third round of."
"A fun beer that packs a punch if you aren't careful. Thought its a dark trippel, this is a good one for people who like dubbels."
"d - tangyness balances ABV. Smooth. Some alcohol on finish but we're talking 10.5% here. Good stuff."
"This is drinkable beer, but be careful because the 10.5 percent ABV will sneak up on you."
"goes down easy, it's on the sweet side, but it's pretty well balanced"
"D - A most certain sipper but really worth trying. Great brew."
"D: yes indeed. high acv makes it a sipper though."
"Very good brew that poured with little head; nice spicy brown ale that had a fruity, bready, spicy smell; good malty and fruity flavor with a raisin or rum finish that went down smooth. Overall, a very good beer with a sweeter taste than most Belgians that I've had. The alcohol content does not rear itself, but this beer has a kick and makes it that much more enjoyable."
"For the price I was expecting more. It was dark brown with little head and came out like liquid caramel. It went down smooth unfortunately, like caramel it was way too sweet and reminded me of a Sam Adams Seasonal. It is very unique though. Just not my bag baby!"
"The taste is fruity, raisiny-spicey with hints of spice, caramel, molasses, caramleised bread crust. It's zesty and lively. The main defect is that it is a touch too consistently sweet but otherwise it's wonderful."
"D: the last point basically touched upon the pure consumability of this fine brew. If susceptible, one very well may find one's self in an ackward situation. Take care and control."
"D: Really good beer that's not too powerful, but definitely a sipper."
"Nice reddish translucent brown with a thin head that builds around the edges of the glass from a thousand tiny bubble trails. The smell is maple syrup and soft wood. Notes of fruit and promises to come. The taste is cherries and wood, then a peppery finish and a crisp, granny smith apple aftertaste. The afertaste melds into a dusky malt that never gets too dry. Outstanding. Nice tingly carbonation up front, a soft buttery feel and then the crisp finish that is as much feel as taste. Very drinkable, hiding its alcohol content well. Not a session beer but we knew that when the style has ""strong"" in the name, didn't we? A bit warm. An excellent beer and a new addition to my rotation for sure."
"Pours dark, clear amber. Lots of bubbles. Has the appearance of a cream soda. Caramel, chocolate malts on the nose, some cherry and cinnamon. Taste is caramel and molasses, dark fruits, pears, finishes with cloves and cardamom. Mouth is sticky and thick; leaves a resin on the mouth between sips."
"D: Drain pour. I should have left this dragon in its lair. I'm going to have to have a Saison Dupont just to cleanse my palate."
"The bubbles are fine, as with most Belgian's I've had to this point."
"D, it`s a very cool beer, from the bottle to the pour and all the way until your finished it`s a exciting beer to drink . cheers.."
"gulden draak is a treat for sure. it is really good and its price usually reflects so. ive had it in the 750ml cork bottle and in the regular 11.2fl. oz. bottle, i have to say if your gonna pay for gulden draak you might as well go for the 750ml botttle because it tastes better in my opinion and youre gonna want more than 11.2fl. oz."
"Mouthfeel is buttery, with lingering spiciness."
"Poured a deep amber color with golden brown highlights, crowned by a good two fingers of sticky, foamy head that hangs around a good long while. Nose of sweet, bready malt, raisin, and a hint of spicy hops, along with a touch of yeasty funk. Taste is mildly sweet up front, then becomes richer and maltier as it goes down."
"Pretty good dark tripel. I love the bottle and the art on the cap too."
"D - Not very drinkable for me but I will definitely go out and get another bottle to try again. I must have had a bad bottle."
"Thin, sweet and different are the first things that come to mind upon quaffing. I also taste some fountain cola syrup and heavy toasty malts. Almost seems like it has too much unfermentable sugars, and that may be on purpose, but it does not quite do it for me. Fun to try, but at nearly $5 a pop, I believe I'll pass next time."
"Taste is much the same, and it's very good. Very creamy, full on the mouthfeel. This stuff is fantastic. This is dangerously drinkable, you never notice the ABV. This is among my favorite Belgian's, right behind Pannepot and Rochefort 10. Delish!"
"Notes: definitely a great brew. I still prefer the Piraat Ale from this brewer, Brouwerij Van Steenberge. But this is a close 2nd!"
"Mainly a sipping beer but still drinkable considering the ABV."
"On a final note: One of my favourite brews. Should be elevated to be the Standard for the Belgian Strong Dark Ales. Will have whenever possible."
"Very good brew."
"750ml bottle served in a tulip. Poured a murky reddish-brown with a quarter inch, tan-colored, effervescing head embedded with tiny bubbles. Head eventually dissipated into a swirl with strands of lacing revealed as the brew was consumed. Nose is predominantly dark fruit, definitely some cherries in the mix. Taste follows nose, but quite a bit of alcohol heat, as well as a slightly medicinal, cherry cough syrup quality with a light, hoppy finish. Mouthfeel fell between light- and medium-bodied with an appropriate amount of background carbonation. In terms of drinkability, I found this brew a little too close to cough medicine to be enjoyable."
"..or, if you like pina coladas, and getting caught in the rain, if you're not into yoga, if you have half a brain..."
"In front of the fire this is a nice way to spend a couple of hours."
"Remarkable bitter end with huge standing, which is a surprise regarding to the initial sweetness, and that makes me appreciate this brew ."
"pours brown in color with a light tan one finger head and a nice sticky lace that held to the finish. mild caramel and pepper nose. smooth malty taste, black pepper, spice, hint of caramel, hint of coffee, has a rock candy sweetness to it. light to medium body and carbonation ok. got it in a six beer sampler so i do not think i would buy it again."
"D: Really like the unique flavor of this one. Would have it again despite my minor criticisms."
"Tremendous example of the style, a well-crafted and great tasting beer."
"Very drinkable brew to be savored on a winter night by the fire. To really appreciate it's sophisticated character try a lager after you had a Gulden Draak and you will see just how bland it is in comparison."
"MF&D - this is an incredibly smooth and creamy beer, and makes the drinking process so damn easy. the only thing holding it back from a perfect is the carbonation could have been a bit more crisp. this is not to say that there wasn't any carbonation, it was just very dull on the tongue."
"D- At 10.5% this one is nothing to take lightly and I would take my time with it to get the full effect, Letting the flavors integrate & develop more. Glad i bought a small version as anymore would be overkill for me, but i would share a big bottle in a minute as this is quite accessible given the style. This would go great during a holiday dinner."
"Pours a murky brown/amber with a nice rocky creamy head. Smell caramel upfront with some fruit maybe? Taste is malty sweet with the caramel flavor prevalent and definitely a dark fruit or fig flavor. Well balanced with nice amount of carbonation. Full bodied but very drinkable."
"Drinkability: Maybe a little too on the sweet side, but overall a complex and refreshing Belgian."
"Complex flavor, with great after taste. Very strong and bitter. Be caution when you drink, the alcohol does not appear very strongly, deceiving the drinker into becoming intoxicated."
"D: This is a drinkable beer, but it's one with a big, bold flavor. Might not be for everyone."
"Appearance was almost a maroon/brown with a clearly unfiltered presence. It pours a tad difficultly, maybe it's cause I'm new, but after pouring the second glass the smallest head I got was 3 fingers thick, and FULL of large bubbles. It's smell was rich with plenty going on, very much consisting of dark fruit. Taste was more of the same, it comes on strong as it works it's way back on your tongue. This was where it becomes difficult because I hate the taste of raisins and that taste is VERY strong in this beer. I could swear apricots are in this one as well. Mouthfeel was a high amount of carbonation that dissipates quickly. Drinkability for me was not great due to the raisin taste as I found myself looking for more tastes with every drink. An enjoyable one time beer, I respect the craftsmanship, but won't purchase again."
"Rich brown color with an orange tinge closer to the rims, large frothy head that refuses to dissolve, strong visible bubbles. While there's caramel and chocolate in the nose at the same time it's malty with a sour edge, dried black fruits, muscular in a sinewy way, not heavy in spite of overall sweetness. In the mouth it shows sufficient carbonation to relieve excess weight. Caramel, butterscotch, raisins, grapes and cinnamon, nutmeg spice. Orange marmalade citrus accents. Relentless presence, this is a beer that does not want to be washed out of your palate."
"D - this beer is wayyy too easy drinking for a 10% ABV beer."
"Notes - Wow, this one's good. It's hard to overstate that. This one may give Trois Pistoles and Brasserie de l'Abbaye des Rocs Grand Cru a run for their money for my favorite Belgian Strong Dark."
"Notes - There's sort of an extremely earthy quality of the beer that clashes with the strong alcohol finish that just doesn't quite do it for me."
"Pours reddish brown really deep red when held to lgiht. A light white head not much lacing. Smells fruity, sweet, belgian candy like aroma. Big taste of figs and raisins with that belgian bready-yeast flavor in there as well. Very smooth beer with little to no detection of the alcohol. The slight sweetness hides it well. Overall not too bad, but not a standout, one I would have again."
"This is a drinkable beer. I had no idea the ABV was so high, I definitely would have guessed it to be around 8% instead 10.5. All around a good beer, a nice representation of a Belgian Strong Dark Ale."
"drinkability: This is something I'd almost recommend a brandy glass for. Lovely."
"Notes: This was such a pleasure to have I just wished I had the words to describe the complexity. A stand out beer with a stand out bottle."
"A carmel cloudy appearance that expels notes of coffee and chocolate. Crisp and bold at the first sip followed by a sweet and smooth sugary finish. This beer was very easy to drink and full of flavor, the only problem that I had with the ""Golden Dragon"" was that it became a bit too sweet for my palate towards the end."
"Mouthfeel is sweet, syrupy, hot, spicy, and smooth in the finish."
"Overall: Easy to drink, well balanced. Could have a few of these, but the ABV could prevent having too many."
"D - This beer is so delicious, I would want to drink a ton of them, but at 10.5% it's hard to put down more than one or two."
"Body is full and the carbonation right on for the style. Overall this is a great Belgian Ale that I will be enjoying again."
"D: Pretty drinkable. A lot of alcohol so it was a bit daunting, but a solid beer nonetheless."
"D: Tasty, goes down dangerously easily, not too filling, strong kick, good representation of style, this beer takes flavors that I don't normally like and used them well to make the beer quite pleasurable to drink."
"Mouthfeel & Drinkability - Mouthfeel is great due to the roundness complimented by the mouth pucking acidity. Drinkability suffers due to style which is substantial."
"D - Great beer, beautiful example of why people love beer....I can't fully express, but its wonderful"
"and as far as drinkability to it, i just wish i had bought more, its awesome"
"This is in no way a chugging beer. This ale needs to be savored."
"I would probably not buy this again but I would happily receive and drink it if it appears under the X-mas tree this year. Santa?"
" Medium complexity with a strange balance, but it's got flavor!"
"This is great as an appetizer with cheese, as the caramel sweetness paired great with a soft sheep's or goat's milk cheese."
"D- i am totally on the fence with this damn beer. i'm not a man with a sweet tooth, so naturally the sweeter things don't appeal to me as much, but as many pros as this beer has for me, it has an equal amount of cons. potency being the least of my concerns, the sugary sweetness seems to drown out other subtle flavors and i would gladly trade the high abv for something a bit more...nuanced. or should i say, something that allows the nuances to be appreciated."
"Taste is overwhelmingly sweet. Like, a Belgian candi bomb. There'a yeasty breadiness to it, as well. Brown sugar, candi, dark fruits ... it's a sugar bomb. I enjoyed it quite a bit. Mouthfeel was nicely chewy."
"D- had some trouble finishing this one. its not that i hated it, its just that 750 is too big. next time ill go with the smaller 330ml. certainly not my favorite for this style."
"Skunky tripel. Dark amber pour with a thick tan head. Aroma is oakey malt with some prunes and raisins. The taste is very disappointing. Musty and alcoholic the whole way through. Somewhat sweet at the end, but not in a good way. Thank God I only bought the little bottle."
"Easy to drink and satisfies the sweet-tooth nicely."
"Nice medium body on the feel. Rich enough to cover up some alcohol and provide a drinkable brew yet not so much as to detract from the complex malt flavors. Add a good amount of carbonation and it's all good. Interestingly, this beer had a notably lower carbonation than other beers from a mixed six pack from the brewery. And that's a good thing, very well balanced in that regard, and yet can renew a bit of surface film/head with ease. Nice dessert beer or Port wine substitute."
"Drinkability : a good beer in the style Belgian strong dark ale (too strong). To drink at cellar t°."
"Doesn't go with everything, so don't plan on serving it with every meal. But it goes great with strong-flavored meats, and as a dessert."
"D: A good Belgian, not amazing in my opinion. It's relatively inexpensive, drinkable, and easy to find, I'm sure I'll have it again at some point."
"Thanks to midnite2sixman for the recommendation, he is an admirable bartender and a cunning patriot and chronicler of beer!"
"Overall, an excellent beer to accompany any meal, especially on a cold autumn day."
"Pours a dark chestnut brown body, clear. Average creamy light tan head, somewhat diminishing. Very floral aroma, some dark fruit. Some alcohol in the nose. Some nuttiness too. Somewhat watery body, soft. Floral taste, some fruitiness like strawberries. Toned down taste compared to the nose. Maybe some toasted or roasted notes. Definitely some dark fruit."
"Drinkability: Obviously one of my favorites here. With a high ABV you certainly can't drink any more than a 750 of this, but it no doubt would be enjoyable throughout. Well masked Abv, and just a pleasure to drink."
"M/D-This is very smooth hardly any carbonation and just a great all around beer. I would drink this all night if I could but the high ABV probably limits people."
"The appearance of this trippel is one thing that automatically sets it apart from the rest. This beer pours a rich deep brownish color that has a red tinge when held up to the light. The head when poured is somewhat thin and then dissapates fairly fast and leaves some lacing behind. At first smell I think of cherries and a little carmel, with further exploration I smell a little of the hops and yeast. On the tongue this beer is feather light and bubbly but not overtly so. After a few sips you may notice it packs a little wallop, that kind of takes away from it's drinkability; while it's stellar you may not want to drink this all night. I usually cap off at about 2 or 4."
"The mouthfeel is tart and sweet at the same time with a medium to full body in its style. This one is very tasty."
"For it being a 10.5%, the alcohol is very well hidden and this is a very drinkable brew. Just wished it was a bit smoother/silkier, especially for a Belgian."
"This is a very good beer, and is really easy to drink. There's nothing 'in your face', everything is just subtle and nice. Highly recommended."
"D: I love this, all round its very nice, but boy it is strong (Alcohol wise, very heavy), & It has left me feeling i have just downed a heap of alcohol (which I have)....hence I cannot see me drinking too much of this in a sitting."
"Tasting Note: After the rating, I popped a Cinnabon into the microwave to warm it up nicely, and had this beer with it. Holy cow! As I was enjoying the two together, I felt very reminiscent of the Holidays... I could actually imagine it was flurrying outside, and that I was going to see my Christmas Tree in the living room as I went to put my fork in the sink. Awesome."
"D- Drinkability is only killed by alcohol. Share a big bottle with a friend. Drink a small bottle all alone on a cold night. Drink anytime but not too much. The candy sweet figs hide every bit of alcohol in this creeping widow."
"An exceptional beer that is simply outstanding. It will have you talking to yourself with each swallow."
"My favourite beer from Belgium that's not black as night (so far...)"
"Glad I tried this, it's become one of my favorites. Awesome on tap as well if you can find it."
"The aby really didn't seem to make it presence known as was well hidden in the background. It was highly carbonated and very creamy. Wicked solid brew. I would buy this one again for sure."
"Drinkability is high on my list. Very smooth, carbonation is just right and I can actually tell the flavors better. Not muddled like a few other examples I've had. The alcohol is barely present, which is the work of a skilled brewer. Worth another bottle for aging because at 10.5% this beer is deceptively drinkable!"
"D: High ABV and sweetness would probably limit this beer to one in a sitting."
"D - Easy to drink and very enjoyable I look forward to getting more of this"
"Notes: A real treat to have on tap at the Bier Markt. I am glad to have tried it."
"Overall: I drank this in Brussels in July 2007 after seeing an American tourist walking in the street and drinking it. Quite a nostalgic beer for anyone who had it for the first time in Belgium-since it is such a memorable brew, you are transported right back to where you first tried it."
"I would prefer a bit less sweet of a beer, but this is still pretty good."
"Wonderfully soft and mellow with perfect carbonation, Gulden Draak doesn't make a wrong move. It looks like a winner in a gold-rimmed goblet, for sure. It smells great... it tastes great, feels great, and drinks great.... Hmm... that's all I can score it on? Well, ok, so, I guess I'll be going with 'Great'? Or maybe I'll go all Tony the Tiger on it and call it 'Grrreat!'"
"D - Good beer. It is not a standout for me but is definitely a good beer."
"All in all, exceptional in all respects, and worth the extra mile or extra bit of cash to get. One you should at least try once in your life."
"D: A very nice finish despite an otherwise rough first sip. The beer progressively drinks better as you go along with a wonderful spicy dark fruit and caramel finish."
"D- Easy to drink."
"D - easy drinking brew."
"i am missing some smells probably due to low temp"
"Drinkability - Excellent Belgian that you would have no idea its approaching 11%. As with most Belgians, this one is done well in moderation due to the high carbonation and high ABV."
"d: still a really good beer; has mellowed with age and is different but still just as good"
"The flavor of Gulden Draak is everything a Belgian Strong Dark Ale should be. Complexity is an understatement, here, as rich caramel malts are awash in a sea of syrupy, dark fruit notes, spice, and musty hops. Mouthfeel is top-notch, with an uppity carbonation level that would be off-putting in other brews. Here, it envigorates the palate and releases some of the more intricate flavors before a warming, boozy alcohol presence grips the back of the palate. Not only is this 10.5% ABV beer delicious, but it's highly (if not dangerously) drinkable. A true belgian beauty."
"D-Very rich and should be enjoyed in moderation."
"Picked up a single bottle of this from the local beer store and had no idea what to expect from this...but wow, it's amazing. The 10.5% isn't apparent at all until you start catching a buzz. Of all the Belgian beers that I've had this is definitely one of the most complex. Great stuff."
"What a kick and what a taste. This is the boozy man's Chimay Blue, and a score that should put it in the competiton for winner of the Stubby Belgain Invite. We'll comclude the Stubby Belgain tomorrow night with, wait for it....another Belgian beer in a stubby bottle."
"This is certainly one of the most gratifying Belgian Strong Dark Ales there is. Fresh and aged, I have had this now on many occasions and never finished the glass anything but satisfied. This is an essential for the cellar and to have on hand. I'm glad this is exactly as it is."
"Poured a deep copper/mahogony into thw glass that prodused a coppery white head. The head dissipated rather quickly. The aroma of malty bread goodness coupled by a sweet spice came through. It tastes remarkably like it smells. The alcohol is well hidden and the spiciness lays over the malt really well. There is a realy clean mouthfeel with this beer with little to no aftertaste. Very drinkable triple. Seek this one out!"
"An entire evening can be devoted to complex beers like this. Just be careful to sip along the way, as this one packs a wallop."
"D = It's clearly a quality brew but, for my taste, I just think that it's a little too sweet to get a better score or to entice me to drink more than one in a sitting. I enjoyed this beer more after I was halfway through it and got used to its sweetness."
"Medium-dark ruby-brown with a medium-sized, light tan, slowly diminishing head. Smell is sweet and malty and big. Belgian yeast, candi sugar, dark fruit and alcohol. The taste is huge. Very complex. Figs, dark cherries, raisin, and tobacco to name a few. It's complexity is matched by thick, full body and syrupy texture. This is one beast of a beer. Fantastic! I definitely recommend seeking out this beer."
"Pours a dark brown with hints of amber, decent amount of foam in the snifter that goes away quickly, leaving no lacing. Smell is super sweet, grassy, and slightly herbal. Taste is ultra-malty, slightly fruity, with hints of dark fruits (plums, raisins) and roasted malts. Good mouthfeel, very high carbonation gives this one a nice body. A good BSDA."
"This is a fine beer. If you haven't tried it, well, you should. One of the better Belgian strong style brews out there."
"Finish is creamy soft and rather sweet."
"Love it, love it. On of my favorites, a damn fine beer."
"Notes: This is an excellent Belgian Strong Dark Ale with all the complexity and strength that I love in Belgian ales."
"D,notes: A great sipping beer. Very well balanced with nice phenolic compliments."
"D: An extremely high ABV, but it is oh so good. Definitely a sit back and sip on beer, good for the winter."
"The smell - slight nutty and candy left me wondering what I was in for. Turns out it was one of the finest beers I have ever had."
"This dark triple pours a deep mahogany color with an active head that settles to a silky cover. Perhaps my nose if off, but I don't find much in the aroma department. Sweet candy malt, dark fruits and a collection of Belgian spices. The taste builds on what I found in the nose. Again an impressive malt structure with ripe berries, toffee, caramel and peppery alcohol. A crisp yet creamy body has a good feel. A well balanced brew considering the strength."
"Pours a cloudy, medium caramel color with a massive, well supported off-white head. Aroma is quite fruity with plenty of plum and raisin notes, caramel, minor clove phenols. On the palate, the incredibly highly carbonated brew brings a rush of bready, melanoiden rich fruits, spicy alcohol and finishes quite dry and clean driven still by the high carbonation. Quite the clean and complex beer, incredibly drinkable and quite enjoyable. I'd really check this one out again."
"Appearane is a murky deep amber brown with a lingering frothy tan head. Malty aroma laced with essence of plum, cherry and very faint flowery hops. Taste is full of the same malty flavors of plum and cherry. Low hop flavor and bitterness takes a backseat to the malt flavors but complements nicely. Mouthfeel is bordering on chewy but not quite like a barelywine. Finish is slightly sweet and dry but not cloying. A beautiful beer all around."
"Mouthfeel is thick, but doesn't feel sturdy enough for the best of the best. I enjoyed the goblet, but won't be clambering for another."
"A very, very good beer. I do not imagine I would purchase a bottle, but for as long as it's available on tap, I will continue to order it."
"Not a starter beer, pretty good for a dessert beer but one is enough. Too sweet!"
"Very highly recommended. Definitely something I would drink again. Probably something I would want to save as a treat for myself to keep from having too much of a good thing too often."
"Served in a bizzare, white bottle, the beer pours a muted hazelnut color with a thin head. The nose is sweet and orange, with raspberry and a metallic element. An initial bitterness to taste turns quickly into an ULTRA sweet bit, fading nicely into spices in the finish. Mouthfeel is medium-to-full, and with good carbonation. This beer is highly drinkable *IF* you can stomach that crazy sugar shock half-way through."
"I tried this beer on December 28, 2007 at ""Smokeless Joe's"" in Toronto. The white bottle caught my eye. This beer poured a dark murky brown with a generous tan coloured head. The aroma was strongly yeasty with a fruit backdrop, possibly plums or raisins. The mouthfeel was medium bodied, and very champagny. The flavour was malty, yeasty, and slightly sour."
"Poured into an oversized wine glass producing two fingers worth of light brown head. It looked a dark brown color that turned more reddish along the edges. Aroma of dark fruits, sweetness and a little alcohol. Had a funney taste to it up front that wasn't too appealing almost like body odor but after that the slightly sweet fruits like figs and grapes kicked in. Had a nice feel to it, not too much carbonation and alcohol wasn't too noticeable."
"D - I really enjoyed this Belgian strong ale. It was the first I remember having it on draft, but I have enjoyed it many times in bottled form. The balanced sweetness w/ dry alcoholic feel is just superb and I recommend it highly. This is well crafted and restrained for the high abv, A welcome ale to my tastebuds."
"Absolutely delishious. This is the best BSDA I've had yet. Drink it warm and you'll have a satisfied grin on your warmly buzzing face by the time you are done."
"Dark brown, lively looking brew. Very bright. Loose but ample light brown head. Smells like candy sugar, molasses, and sweet vanilla. A dark tripel -- cool, why not. Pretty high residual bitterness over a mildly roasty, sweet and juicy flavor. The beer is surprisingly well balanced for 10.5%, with alcohol certainly being felt, but not tasted. Sweetness becomes a bit cloying. Too spritzy and boozy for me to want to enjoy more than one of these, but nice on a warm day fowsure."
"D - Small servings only please, the large bottle of this was difficult to finish, even sharing it with friends. It seems that Steenberge loves high alcohol brews, I just wish they'd make a session brew. They obviously have great talent, but does every beer need to be over 10%?"
"drinkability is good. this is a complex brew with many flavors and aromas, and a notable alcoholic tag. the richness of the profile makes this one more of a sipping brew. a very enjoyable belgian strong dark."
"D - While it feels light, the sweetness to me begins to get tiresome. A full 750ml is a bit much for one."
"Poured from a bottle into a goblet. It had a deep reddish brown color and a creamy tan half inch head. Brown sugar was my first thought after smelling with some sweet malt and caramel hints. The taste was super sugary sweet caramel and maple flavor with hints of berries and a warm alcohol feel as it goes down. The sweet creamy feel balances the carbonation and makes it smooth enough to have another. Reminds me of a dark Jamaican spiced rum."
"Definitely one the the best beers out there."
"When you're in the mood for a big, powerful dark ale, this is a great choice."
"feels smooth and extremely creamy. very easy to drink. a great beer."
"Drinkability: It's a tripel wrapped in a +2 Cloak of Maltiness. For that, it's okay, as long you don't mind the high level of sweetness and glaring alcohol presence."
"I can appreciate this beer for what it is, it's just not for me."
"After Georgia popped the cap in 2004, this was one of the first Belgians I picked up. I thought it was good then, and I think it's great now. Pours a deep brown with a strong head. Very bubbly. Smells like dried fruit and prunes. Taste is sweet fruit, sugar, alcohol, raisins, and prunes. The taste is very complex, but it comes together and is absolutely delicious. Mouthfeel is rather effervescent, but it's a Belgian brew, so that's expected. One of my favorite Belgians and brews."
"Overall, I would have to say that this one was excellent. Really, a top notch brew that I would love to be able to try again. Luckily, it is everywhere that would not be an issue. One of the most solid representations of the style, and truly an ale that cannot be ignored."
"D - Too strong to have more than one. But the taste is so good it might make me think twice."
"Drinkability - I was lucky that this was my ""gateway beer"" to Belgians back in the day. This brew rammed home all the variety that is present in many Belgian Strong Dark Ale offerings. This is not for the faint of heart nor is it for someone who is expecting a typical ""beer"". This will make you a believer in the value of going beyond the water, malt, hops doctrine."
"D- Very delicious apéritif. A strong drink, so hard to recommend more than one, but perhaps something worth keeping on hand for when the occasion arises."
"A unique style of beer, this poured a very hazy burgundy with lots of thin tan head. It smelled like dark fruit and caramel malt, with noticeable alcohol scent. Its flavor was super sweet, tasting like strong caramel malt with some lemon hops. It was thin but oily with some carbonation, and it had a caramel aftertaste that ended more salty than anything else. Overall this was a very sugary and interesting beer, good as a novelty but not as a regular drinker."
"As for the pairing, I could not have been more pleased. Smoke and fat love this beer. And frankly, so do I. So sad the dollar is down against the Euro..."
"D: Pretty strong, but a six pack of these is just right for a strong healthy man. I'll have two please."
"This pour's color and aroma is present before it hits the bottom of the chalice and exhibits an inviting comfortability. you sense alcohol but not the 10.5% it carries. I don't taste the chocolate like others do but I'm sure this beer is good with it. The taste is robust with few hidden features-like browned almonds in butter & demerara sugar. Liquor proceeds the tasting but not to the point of overpowerment. Like the Maredsous, one is sufficient and should be appreciated like a brandy, not like a Sunday afternoon 12 pack."
"M/D: Feels fairly carbonated after first swallowing. Medium bodied. Couldn't have more than 2 of these."
"Body is very rich and creamy, just what you want for a dessert beer. I've had quite a few light tripel style brews over the years but this is a first in the dark tripel category and I must say I am quite impressed. I'm definately putting a few of these beauties away for cellaring one could only wonder the improvements this beer will make over a year or two."
""
"I was very impressed with this beer, and will happily buy it again. Not my favorite of the style, but fairly close."
"High Carbonation and Medium body. Tingles on the tongue from the alcohol. Couldn't drink more then one of these in a sitting, as it really hits the palette."
"A real nice beer, there's a reason why this is available out here in the middle of Oregon!"
"Pours three inch off-white and highly carbonated head. Very cloudy, dark amber color. Smell has fruit and spice. Good lead it to a very good taste. Hints of ginger and other spices. also hints of some citrus. Very drinkable. pretty happy with this beer."
"It's by no means bad. I'm just not getting the same thing out of it as everyone else. It feels surprisingly smooth, but I couldn't have much of this."
"If this beer isn't highly drinkable, I'm going to MAKE it highly drinkable. 1/2 of a beer is an experience. A great session beer if you are in for a SHORT session. Lots of alcohol, hidden but substantial carbonation challenge your ability to continue enjoying this long term. But you know what? YOU are the boss of you."
"Pours hazy red-brown with a bit of a diffuse vermilion glow - rather gorgeous color. Head is massive and all bubbles, no cream whatsoever; very odd. Dies down quickly to thin, bubbly lacing here and there. Aroma is deep and rummy with characteristic Belgian yeast tones. Notes of walnut and honey dominate with nice raw malty undertones and cake sweetness. Mouthfeel is surprisingly hot and sharp with a medium body that has a lightly juicy character. Flavor is very well matched to aroma, but the sweetness comes through a bit more than the nutty flavors. Molasses, dark fruits - raisin, prune, tempered by a touch of apple skin and flour. Fairly strong cake and cookie malts. Yeast comes through present but nicely rounded out. Finish is sweet and lightly sour with a long, warm, and dry aftertaste."
"I cannot say enough about the taste--flush with fruit, chocolate, perfectly carbonated, and with a head that won't quit. I'm completely wowed. The very high ABV (10.5 %) catches up eventually, but this is not one to be missed. A beer that deserves to be described in superlatives, Gulden Draak is sumptuous, serious, and outstanding, a gem of a BSDA and superior to most I've had, and I've had a few. Great."
"D: Did not seem like a 10.5% ABV beer at all. For its class found it very drinkable, which for me would mean once in a while given its richness."
"A complex, delicious sipping treat!"
"Mouthfeel was good and the drinkabilty was high as well. It took me a while to ""get"" this beer, but once I did, I could easily drink this daily! Definitely a great beer that I will enjoy again and again."
"the first crusades; hence of course the form of a Viking ship that the beast was given. Approximately one hundred years later, Boudewijn IX, Count of Flanders, was the Emperor of Constantinople in one of the following crusades. Because he found the statue so beautiful, he simply took it back to Flanders with him. In 1382, the cities of Bruges and Ghent even did battle for this statue."""
"Excellent dark belgian. I will definitely seek this out again."
"From a short, fat, 11.2 oz ceramic white bottle with a black back-drop with a dragon on it, this powerful Strong Dark Ale pours a magnificient ruby-red, copper/brown color with a tremendous, impressive head... smell is slightly malty with caramel and bread aromas bursting through... taste is equally dominated by a caramel essence with bread and butter flavors, and a nutty, sweet, honey essence that completely takes hold over this brew... very unique and intersting... copped as part of a six-pack ""Living Beers"" gift set from the Van Steenberge Brewery in Belgium... spicy, rich, thick, and full of flavors, this is definitely a top-notch beer... 10.5% ABV is slightly hard to detect, so go easy with this one... awesome rendition of the style... Definitely recommended..."
"Bottle conditioned and courtesy of the LCBO as part of a mixed Belgian sixer. Deep brown body with a long-lasting tan head. Aroma of caramel and vanilla. Extremely sweet, chewy flavour, with the caramel coming through again. Goes down very smoothly, and I imagine would pair excellently with desserts."
"D - Would pair excellent as an after-dinner or with a cigar."
"Pours a really nice deep brown, think oak. Very high carbonation, lessens with some time in the glass. Creamy white head, great retention. I pick up a big honey sweetness in both the taste and smell. Althought it has a high ABV, it drinks like a lager half it's strength."
"Poured into a chalice a nice light brown color, nice carbonation (Big POP on opening), nice little creamy tannish head, some sticky lacing follows. The nose is malty, nice touch of dark fruits, and caramel. The taste is malty, dark fruits, caramel. The taste is also slightly sweet at first with a nice tangy finish. The alcohol is hidden very well for a brew with this high of an ABV. Medium body, complex brew. Very drinkable, I like this one, at first I thought it might be like the Piraat Triple, but a dark version, too my surprise it is an excellent BSDA, and very tasty, recommended."
"Pours a cloudy brown that has a big touch of amber to it. Minimal head. Nose is slight with a lean towards marshmallows. Touch of citrus. Flavor is very well balanced with a strong sweet tone that stays constant. Strong and steady. After a while you get a slight alcohol tone that has stayed masked consistently as you drink. Tons of things rolling over your tongue on this one. Caramel is another. Mouthfeel is a bit too high on the carbonation, which drops the drinkability just a touch. Overall damn good. Worth trying. Worth trying again."
"Poured this one from a 11.2oz white bottle. Dark brown color, Incredible head! a very, very foamy beer. Very malty nose, yeasts, dark candied fruits,almost gingerbread-like aroma. smells delicious. Very full on the palate. overwhelmingly good flavors of yeasts, malts, very sweet-almost candylike mouthfeel. A good choice around the holidays most definatley. This beer is one to savor very slowly."
"That's probably why I don't ever see this in 6-packs."
"Overall, fantastic. I love the style, and I've only tried a few of varieties out. Will easily make it amongst my top favorites."
"Poured into Gulden Draak snifter at 57F. Massive head stuck around for a bit leaving some intricate lacing. Color is somewhat lighter and redder than I was expecting. A very presentable pour. Nose was malt, candi syrup, slight dark-fruit; not sure if it was my nose today, but not much happening on the aroma side for me. Taste was spot on, with fabulous carbonation fanning the sweet vapors back into my nose. Lots more going on here than in nose, with figs, tobacco, cherry notes. Belgian fruity yeast character present but not over the top. All in all, a fine beer."
"At any rate, Gulden Draak is a Belgian that I'd like to meet with much higher frequency. Cheers!"
"The taste is fairly sweet but finishes slightly sour and bitter. Also has hints of caramel and dark fruits."
"This was an interesting beer as it seemed to change with the temperature as different tastes would invite you to wait and then try again. A beer to be savored and drank when you have time to ponder all the different nuances to it."
"D - Good solid beer. Too boozy to session but very nice."
"This beer i suspect will get better with age. It pours looking like a dubbel, and is kind of a mix between dubbel and trippel. It pours dark brown with a thin white head. smells like a strong ale, but doesnt taste like one. at first it feels and tastes like a dubbel in the mouth as the carbonation is more flat than most trippels but more abrasive than most belgian strong dubbels. an interesting and certainly good beer but i found it a bit watery by belgian standards and for its color. But nothing to snuff at. I bet it will be delectable with three or four years of cellar time. abv is hidden well"
"Search it out, and when you find it - hoard it."
"Drinkability: I could probably drink a lot of this, but I have a big love for the golden dragon and the town of Ghent... oh and a bigger love for tasty beer."
" Body is rich and creamy, just great for a Belgian dark ale. Velvety smooth in the mouth, without being foamy on the swallow. This is an excellent example of the style, and one that I wish I drank more often. Hopefully I'll amend that soon."
"Poured cold into a Chimay glass. Deep brown with a luscious head, slow to dissipate. Nice lacework. Strong swirl produces aromas of malt, caramel, & raisins. Initial taste is surprisingly tart, notes of cranberry or grapefruit, malt and alcohol. Heavy on the carbonation. I remember enjoying my last one a lot more. Should be served warmer is my guess."
"Somehow this brew balances nicely. It really is a top notch treat from across the pond. love it!~"
"I think this is a relatively drinkable beer given its strong alcohol content but I wouldn't want to drink more than 1 or 2 in a row. Overall this is a flavorful, complex beer and I can see where Unibroue gets its inspiration for Chambly Noire. Not personally my favorite beer but objectively speaking, this is a great Belgian beer."
"But, no doubt, a good brew!"
"Id recommend this."
"D: Not bad. The flavor is a little underdeveloped. A bit too carbonated for my taste as well. Not a bad beer, but as far as Belgian beers go, you can do a lot better. Maybe Trippels just aren't my thing. I dunno."
"Cloudy dark mahogany body with no head. The smell is very malty and fairly sweet with just a hint of spice. The combo of sweetness and spice is a bit overwhelming at first. The malt profile is a bit muted especially in the presence of the blast of sweetness. The body seems to get a bit heavier at the back of the palate and it's possibly the best part of the beer. Not a bad beer but a bit too sweet compared to the malt profile for me."
"Opinion: This is a really nice beer. It certainly isn't your average Tripel in that it is so dark and doesn't showcase the spicy hops like the others do. This beer has a wealth of malt complexities that almost put it in with the strong dark ales as much as a Tripel. The dryness in the finish is more characteristic of a Tripel. This is a really nice beer nonetheless and I would drink it again. I especially think that this one would be nice in Belgium. The next time I am there, I will seek this one out...along with Orval and some others."
"This one is a fantastic beer. I highly recommend it."
" Prosit, MK"
"Drinkability: As it warmed up in my glass, I began to enjoy this beer more and more. The coldness made it seem a bit harsh to me, but I think next time I would have this at room temperature. The heaviness of the beer, not to mention the 10.5% ABV, makes this a beer that I would want to spread out over the course of a night (I can only find this in 750ml bottles), but it is very enjoyable."
"750 ml bottle poured dark reddish brown whith an off white billowy head Aromas of grapes (almost vinegar) and yeast fill the nose thru the tulip glass . Smooth rich palate with a slight alcohol burn . The taste of malts, fruits, and alcohol are wonderfuly filling my mouth a well made ale and great bottle design keeps out the uvs"
"BIA (Buy It Again?): Absolutely. Wonderful stuff. I love the presentation in the bottle. White heatshrunk Duvel-type ""pony"" bottle. Very unique. Certainly keeps it well protected against the UV!"
"Drinkability- It's ok for drinkability, but the 10.5% ABV would kill the average person trying for a session here. I'm glad I'm cooking with the rest."
"Notes: This is the last of the 4 pack I purchased of this. I made it through all of them, but my mouth feels bruised every time I finish one of these. Maybe too complex for it's own good, this beer is a good choice, but a very tiring drink that can't be rushed."
"Pours rich tea color with reddish hues and a small loose light tan head that recedes quickly, but is kept alive by small surface pools of visible effervescence. Spotty lacing observed. The smell is sweet, dark fruits and yeast. Medium-light bodied, the mouth feel is conditioned by tiny little bubbles that lend an overall smooth and creamy character. Full flavored, the taste is mush the same as the aroma. The 10.5 is extremely well hidden...i would have never guessed that it weighed out that heavy. Really glad that i had the opportunity to try this one."
"Great aroma, smooth flavor, and a full pallet of flavors.. Poured into a glass makes a fine creamy head, and releases the fine odors that you and your company can enjoy together. A little high on the alchohol aftertaste, but I still highly recommend this beer for the true Abbey Ale lovers."
"Poured into my Chimay goblet, Gulden Draak has an attractive dark ruby color with a few centimeters of foam. The aroma is fruity and sweet. Dark and ripe fruits like figs, plums, raisins, and a touch of sweetness that comes across as molasses. The taste is superb, very similar to the aroma and the alcohol is just a bit noticeable in the finish. Great velvety mouthfeel and lots of carbonation in this one. A very enjoyable strong dark ale."
"A tawny amber gem in the glass, champagne bubbles like fireworks, and an incredible mountainous head. Smell disappoints a bit after this, as in addition to the suspected notes of bananas, cloves, etc, I found it a bit metallic. Upon ingestion, the front half of the tongue is coated with syrupy rum raisin flavors, with little on the back. The mouthfeel is ok, until late in the game when one is left with a sensation not unlike one might experience after dispensing the contents of one's piggy bank into ones one's mouth. I've been craving a great Belgian all day, and frankly I'm disappointed. Especially after I spend 12 bucks on the damn thing."
"T: This beer is absolutely jam packed with flavor. Good fresh or aged, its takes on different personalities as time goes on. This is a keeper."
"Poured from a 750 ml corked and caged bottle. The beer has a deep reddish brown color with a huge, pillowy head that leaves plenty of lacing behind. Aroma is malty and spicy with a little bit of flowery hops detected in the nose. Taste is nice and malty with notes of caramel, molasses, Belgian candi sugar and rum soaked cherries. Alcohol is there, but it just adds to the complexity of the beer. This is without a doubt a rich and warming beer that goes down way to easily for it's strength. I'll be picking up some more of this for the upcoming Fall and Winter months."
"Drinkability - this is good ale, but not great ale, so that suppresses sessionability for me - that, in addition to the high abv."
"Purchased a 12 oz bottle in December 2005 and I have had this in my beer cellar until I decided to drink it this past weekend, July 2007. Poured it into a Duvel chalice, which produced a nice large fluffy white head that only lasted briefly. The smell was like candy, very sweet tasting. The color was a dark red, almost bordering on brown. The taste blew me away though. Malty, and with huge notes of sugar and fruit. It was a pleasure to just sip and enjoy. The taste got even better as it warmed up to room temp. The only drawback from this beer was that it's high in alcohol, I felt it after barely finishing one. So I am glad I had just this one on my evening's menu."
"Pours a dark mahogany color with a thick billowing tan head. Excellent head retention. Pleasant malty aroma with hints of cane sugar and black licorice.Tastes very much like licorice, almost to the point of being like cough syrup in it's flavor. 10.5% abv is very upfront and apparent. Thick and syrupy mouthfeel. As far as drinkability is concerned, it's a bit to much like cough syrup in it's taste and feel to be TRULY enjoyable to me, but not so bad as to be dumped out. Maybe i've stayed away from truly flavorful beers for too long...."
"Splendid! Pours a deep, opaque brown with a very thick and remarkably persistent head. Aroma is malty and inviting. Flavor is strong but not fierce, with sweet overtone like molasses and some smoky hints, and just a dash of bitterness. Jazzy and tingly, this is a beer one should sip and savor."
"appreciate and enjoy."
"M&D - smooth and delectable for such a strong beer the ABV is sneaky, an amazing beer, great with a meal, and very attractive in a snifter or goblet, or even a wine glass, a hall of fame beer, that i will revisit time and time again"
"Love the bottle."
"Corked bottle after a good day of work...thin, transparent body with a reddish-brown hue in a Chimay glass...a citrus (grapefruit?) aroma...smooth back-of-mouth malt/hop balance. The effects of the alcohol grow slowly, warming yet heightening the sensesa pleasat digestif, indeed...."
"Much to my suprise she came back with a 750 ml corked and caged bottle. She even had a special snifter glass with the Gulden Draak name. She poured it perfectly with a thick and foamy three finger head. The aroma was wonderful and the taste sublime. Slightly chilled, the malts imparted a cacaphony of flavors. This triple was so fine that I never noticed the 10.5% ABV. At $19 for the one bottle, thank goodness for business trips."
"Nothing annoys me more than the lack of a date stamp on the bottle. Without it, you don't know if the aging process has impacted the beer and why. In this instance, I experienced argueably the best triple I've ever had, but I'd like to know if I should expect that every time or if I just got lucky and bought a bottle that was perfectly aged and uncorked at the right time. Anyway, it poured a lovely copper color with a thin but creamy head into my Chimay goblet. Carbonation was active. The large and unusual white bottle makes me feel like I'm drinking from a milk bottle. The nose was cheery with fruitiness and hints of cherries and cherry licorice. Honestly, not flavors I normally seek out, but somehow this really works. The taste reflects the aroma; fruity with cherries and strawberrries. Very bouncy with candied sugar making for a smooth, sweet but balanced and pleasant experience. Incredibly smooth and drinkable...I'm very suprised, since I don't expect any of these qualities from your average triple. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy. The lovely fruitiness bathes the palatte. This is a highly drinkable triple. I never expected such sweetnes and smoothness from a triple, but wow ! This is a must have. Maybe I just lucked out, but I will be sure to seek this out again and check for consistency."
"It pours into a Gulden Draak glass with a deep amber hue, with a off white lacing of foam. In the nose, I get dark fruits and a small presence of alcohol. It has the characteristcs of a nice barley wine, with the smoothness of a great Belgian triple."
"This is a very strong beer. You really have to drink this one with caution. It would be a dangerous session beer. None-the-less it's very tasty."
"Very drinkable, need more 750's of this. Glad I finally got around to trying this."
"D: This is a great after dinner/dessert beer. I paired it with some Belgian chocolate and it matched perfectly. I really enjoyed it, I'll definitely be having it again."
"An excellent beer. An absolute treat whether on draft or on tap."
"Had this served in a Gulden Draak glass (neat glass too). Light head which is long lasting. Plenty of lace. Sweet estery aromas with lots of caramel, malt, hint of roasty and yeasty. Big flavor! all of the aroma, except the esters which translates to nice fruitiness. Lush body. Alcohol is subtle but there. Killer beer. Sweet caramel finish. One of my all time favs. Better on draft than bottle."
"Not bad..."
"very smooth, reasonably drinkable, but I've had easier drinkers at 10%."
"Drinks very easy for such a complex beer, very pricey, but a nice inulgence at $5.50 a bottle"
"Delicious! A must try for any who have never tasted it."
"Yum. This will become a staple."
"Pours a dark brown with decent head and carbonation. Aroma is a slight lemon with a noticeable alcohol tinge and spicy florals. Taste is a strong spicy and thick flavor with noticable alcohol overtones. It's still smooth, however, and even sweet. A great brew, and one I would seek in the future."
"D: This is definetly a keeper and should be enjoyed for all it's worth. Highly impressed with this style and brand."
"I poured this at about 55 degrees (F) and I'll not let it warm too much. Pretty solid Belgian. Enjoyable, but the alcohol burn DOES hinder it just a bit in my opinion. NOt the best of it's style, but nice, and I love the bottle; it'll fit nicely on the shelf."
"drinkability is ok too. the alcohol is a little on the warm side, and the bit of sting from the carbonation takes away from the drinkability a bit. however, after swirling it for a minute the carbonation had subdued to a much more pleasant level and the sting was pretty much gone."
"this beer is delicious and strong"
"D: A wonderful beer that is enjoyable on all levels, pleasing to all the senses. Paired with food or sipped alone, there are a select few beers that can compete with GD. Will enjoy this one again and again, 4 thumbs up (me & my wife)! Thanks to Jef and the team at Van Steenberge for making this fine stuff!!!"
"An exceptional beer and one of my favorites. It's not always that easy to find, but if you do, it's definitely worth a try. A real treat."
"Gulden Draak (Dark Triple) pours a dark reddish brown color with an enormous off white head from a twelve ounce brown bottle that was painted white. There is serious lacing of my Gulden Draak tulip. I smell dark red fruit, maybe some candy sugar. There is a little red fruit in the flavor, but not much that starts the taste, then it becomes more phenolic with some alcohol spiciness. Interesting, definitely worth a try."
"All in all a wonderful beer, one of my favorites."
"Tastes of grapes and sweet malts. Maybe a bit of fig or date in there as well. Very full, creamy mouthfeel. The only downside at all is the drinkability. Very powerful abv. Just one of these belgian behemoths and I've got a mean buzz."
"D- Very, very dangerously drinkable."
"Pours a slightly cloudy brownish/red with a large tan head that leaves great lacing. A very impressive looking brew. The smell is pungent with sweet malt, alcohol, and some different dark fruits. The taste is creamy with dark fruit,sweet malt,candy sugar,alcohol, and a carmel/like smoothness. The m/f is medium with all the flavors mixing very well wgile doing a good job of hiding the 10.5 alcohol. The warmth is there,just hidden in the first sip. This is a true Belgian classic that should be had by all !!!! Cheers."
"Simply an outstanding Strong Dark Ale..."
"750ml bottle, corked and caged. Poured into my small Piraat goblet. Pours a wonderful shade of brown with nice ruby highlights hidden within. Big fluffly white head that dissipated to a nice glass coating lace. BIG hints of dark fruit here particularly raisins and dates soaked in a bit of alcohol. Underneath that I found a faint, buttery malt sweetness aroma. This beer smells really big! To my surprise, it did not taste very big...meaning that it hid its palatable alcohol pretty well. On top of the raisiny flavor I also got a nice refreshing apple taste. Also present is a subtle caramel malt backbone with little bits of butterscotch here and there. This is super tastey. Normally I'd think carbonation would be weird in a beer like this, but the bubbles are very smooth and enhance the creamy mouthfeel which leaves behind a pleasant sweetness that is not sticky. And finally, this beer will kick you to the curb if you're not careful...it hides the booze extremely well."
"The appearance of this beer is very dark with a slight amber hue. The carbonation gushed and left a thick off-white persistent head with nice lacing. The smell is sour and spicy  definite malt as well. The taste is malty with sourness. There are some citrus notes.excellently balanced. This beer has a full feel, just shy of chewy. The carbonation lends a refreshing surprise This is an excellent beer that Im thinking is very drinkable!"
"Absolutely exceptional appearance! Poured a huge very thick beige head that actually retained its height. Reduced a bit which revealed evenly thick lacing that encircled my glass. The color is a very dark red. When held up to the the light it is clear which no sediment or hazing. Bubbling carbonation is seen rising from the bottom up. First sip was extremely over-powering and hits you hard. 10.50 ABV is not hidden. Very thick bodied.. Doesnt really leave a long lingering bitterness, but has a dry finish. Great carbonation.. There is so much going on in the taste its hard to rate and describe. Sweet malts with hints of molasses and raisins.No hop flavor I could detect. Aroma is all malt and alcohol. The mouthfeel is very harsh and doesn't go down smooth. This beer makes no attempts to please the masses and doesn't hold back on anything. This came in a special 6 pack of Exclusive belgian Ales. This is a complex beer that takes no prisoners!"
"This beer poured into a Chimay chalice a chestnut brown color, with a small white lace head that held up quite well. Smell was through the roof with overly ripe fruit flavors, and some chocolate. Sort of reminds me chocolate covered cherries. Taste was also big on the candy-like fruit, and also a bit of spicy herb as well. Mouthfeel was medium bodied, and high on the drinkability factor. The alcohol is really well hidden on this beer. I never would have guessed that it was anywhere near 10% alcohol. I will definitely be coming back to this beer in the near future."
"The bar area was dark, but so is this beer itself. Some crimson peeked out from the dark murk when I exposed it to the light. A really nice, foamy, off-white head on this one that persisted long enough that I had to ingest some of it to get at the liquid foundation. The nose is potent, though less of alcohol than sweet grains and dark, fruity notes. The taste is sweeter than I had expected, and the alcohol was not quite in balance, though also not unduly assertive. A bit of chocolate/red wine and hops makes things interesting. The mouthfeel is nice--substantial but not clingy. Our server pushed this as ""what some have called the best beer in the world."" That lowered my expectations for it, actually, but I'm glad I gave it a try."
"Pours a dark ruby color, with a moderate off-white head that dissipated into a slight cap that left some spotty lacing. The smell is of light candi sugar, dark fruit, not as strong as a tripel. The taste is slightly sweet, a hint of carob, light raisin/plum flavor. This brew would benefit from less carbonation as I think it takes away from the taste. It has tight carbonation, champagne like, finishes smooth. A very nice balanced beer & quite drinkable though the carbonation needs some dulling down."
"Cheers!"
"Served from draft into a Gulden Draak tulip, this is a dangerously wonderful beer. The Appearance is a deep ruby with a very tall, creamy off-white head that leaves a very sticky lace and nice-sized collar until then end...which I have to say, never lasts that long for me, and I've had many! The aroma is very sweet, malt and brandy, slight spice but not to complex. The taste is much deeper, initially a bit sweet and vinous, then opening into fig, toffee, prune and toasted malt, and finishing with a strong boozy kick that is a bit on the fusel side. There is not much effervescence and a nice creamy mouthfeel that is well balanced with a bit of diactly butteriness that really works well here, adding up to a very drinkable beer."
"As it is, I do not really like it, but will give it another try."
"Draak is one of the best belgian strong ales I've ever had. Highly recommended!"
"Drinkability: One of the more drinkable Belgians in my opinion, I would actually beable to drink more than one. Most Belgians are either too sweet or a little to dry. The"
"enjoy and cheers!"
"Drinkability- Pretty drinkable for a 10.5% beer."
"Drinkability - A good beer that has a lighter body than the color implies. A great match to Indian food and other foods with a bit of spice."
"Just plan on falling asleep soon after..."
"An a-grade acomplishment and definately worth trying if you haven't. It's perhaps the most well-rounded (appearance, aroma, mouthfeel and taste) brew I've had yet, but ensure you drink it at around 10 degrees celsius because anything below just won't do it justice."
"I enjoyed this beer after a long night of work and it definitly hit the spot. I will be sure to buy this one again and again."
"Traditional trippel--high alcohol and high malt flavors. Smooth and full flavored."
"I thoroughly enjoyed this beer. While I am very particular to the dark strong ales, which is my drink of choice, that bias makes me picky. I would purchase Gulden Draak again in a heartbeat."
"An interesting brew. There are some characteristics that seem to draw from the dubbels bag of tricks, despite the main thrust of the ale in the dark strong direction. Dark triple ehh?-- those wily Belgians, you just can't pin them down. Makes for interesting sipping. The label art is pretty wild too."
"Taste; cherries and plums greet the tongue on the initial sips, followed by a little bit of chocolate and caramel. There's a bit of a floral quality in the middle, and a fairly large alcohol presence in the finish. If it were not for the strong alcohol presence, this beer would be really damn good. Mouthfeel is full bodied with a nice smooth natural ccarbonation, and due to the alcohol the drinkability takes a significant hit."
"I loved this. Just a real powerhouse Belgian. Just the prospect of relaxing with a glass of this and good book at the end of a long day could keep me going for a while."
"Full bodied with a well-carbonated, fizzy mouthfeel. This is a delightfully drinkable sipping beer."
"Overall, a generally cloying and sweet beer, but a wonderful look, smell and great taste. Better when warmish."
"A exquisitely crafted beer, and a very fine example of a Belgian ale. Very recommended."
"Poured out a dark reddish brown, with a bubbly off white head, great lacing. The nose offers lots of dark fruits like plums, cherries and raisins, followed by sweet candy sugar. There's a bunch of alcohol in the nose too. The taste is sweet sugar, bubblegum, cottong candy, and spice up front. The finish hits you with dark fruit again, then some faint chocolate and alcohol. Mouthfeel was creamy, with a long burning finish."
"Drinkability: A tasty and very drinkable ale. The alcohol is masked very well. Rich and hearty with unique flavor."
"Appearance: very deep golden colour with a large very thick creamy biege head, excellent retention and glass-coating lacing. Smell: very sweet alcohol, bubblegum, caramel and fruit aromas: pear, some cherries and banana too. Taste: woomph, there's the alcohol; dark fruits, some spiciness. Very sweet plus sour and bitter. A very long bitter-sweet aftertaste. Lightly carbonated. Drinkability: there's certainly reward for the very strong alcohol sweetness, and I'm left wanting more. This is a beer to grow and grow on you."
"The nose is nicely coincident to the taste values. This sibling to the strong pale ale Piraat belgium is equally great. It is a tad heavier, consistent with the Strong Dark Ale belgium that is GD."
"D: Very nice and easy to drink, alcohol is not really a factor in the taste but in drinkability its always there in the back of my mind. This beverage would pair well with so many foods I would have to say its would compliment almost any meal thats not spicy."
"I've had this twice and find it really enjoyable, nearly comparable to to Belgium's Trappist beers. The smell and taste are exceptional, but that same richness makes it suffer a bit in mouthfeel and drinkability."
"Found this one during my birthday dinner @ Mac's Speed Shoppe in Charlotte for 6 dollars a bottle. Poured in a beautiful Belgian glass that they sold to us for $3. Nice dark, full of malty goodness. Incredible lacing & carbonation. One of my favorites in quite awhile."
"Beautiful dark amber color, with a decent head that kept pace with the beer as I drank it. Sweeter taste than I had expected, with a definite almond flavor. Could taste the alcohol as well, but it stood up to the comlexity of its flavors. Reminded me of an almond liquor, only with carbonation. Be carfeul to drink slowly, and try to pair it with a game bird or sharp cheese."
"Not as smooth as Chimay Blue but still very enjoyable. This is a good one for the LAST beer of the evening."
"Good and interesting beer, aggressively distinct personality."
"11.2 fl oz bottle obtained at Florian's in Auburn as part of a variety 6-pack. Murky brown body with light tan head that's a couple fingers thick. Smells yeasty, fruity (dates? plums?) and roasty. Tastes roasty, fruity, somewhat chocolatey maybe? Complex and unique certainly. The only dark tripel I know of, so I'm not sure what to compare it to. Rather pleasant and tasty. Good for anyone who like dubbels or maybe stouts."
"D: I'm just now starting to get into the belgian style beers, and I think this was a good start, definatly something I'd get again."
"Notes: One of my favorites. This is one serious Belgian ale that will knock you on your ass if you're not careful. If at all possible, enjoy this in its proper tulip glass."
"Dark murky brown color nice thick tan head , small bubbles  nose of caramel , cereal , yeast , orange peel , floral , vanilla , honey , and alcohol  tastes of caramel , mocha , yeast , honey , and sour red cherries  palate is creamy and light - aftertaste caramel , cereal , honey and acidic"
"Mouthfeel is medium but the alcohol leaves the palate sticky. Leaves the palate with a dry malt aftertaste. Could almost make it as a Belgian wee heavy. It hurts so good I can't stop."
"to cheese or dark sauces."
"Poured into a tulip glass it has an inviting deep reddish brown hue. I poured it very slowly to compensate for the extreme growth of white head after pouring. It grows like a chia pet to about three fingers big. After taking a few sips the head reduced to 1 finger with light lacing around the glass. I get sweet smells along with dried fruits and spices. Taste starts out sweet and then slightly sour with flavors of prunes and dried apricots; then moves to more roasted malt flavors. It warms the throat as the alcohol is present right at the end, especially when it warms up. Mouthfeel is rich, but not overly viscous. It has very good drinkability, and its a pleasure from start to finish...I wish I had some more!"
"Mouthfeel is very good, with the carbonation spot on. Drinkable, spare for the high ABV. Another very good Belgian!"
"It is highly drinkable. The only thing keeping my drinkability number from being higher was the elevated ABV."
"The mouth is well-rounded, not overly complex, and smooth. The sweetness nor the alcohol overwhelms the palate--thus resulting in a very drinkable brew, for those who enjoy the style. Very solid overall. And again, the golden dragon on the label is very cool."
"Pours dark, almost black with some light amber reddish high lights. Nice thick half inch head that doesn't seem to be going any where. Sent is subtle with smells of butterscotch and notes of caramel, cloves and bread. Taste is nice, sweet, mild barley, sweet caramel, bread, little toasted malt, hint of bitterness mixed masterfully with fruit I can't name. The after taste is nothing too crazy, but enough to keep you coming back for more. The burden and blessing with this beer is it's alcohol content. Its great that such an intoxicating beer is so good, but I can only drink so many before I am sauced. All the same I enjoy this beer and its adventures once every other week."
"Dark amber in colour with medium carbonation. Aromas of berry fruit, bubblegum, sweet malts, and caremel. More sweet malts in the mouth, along with notes of black pepper, wood, brown sugar, and red grape skin. Heavy in the mouth, but the carbonation level keeps it from getting too cloying. Pretty good, but not as good as I had hoped it would be."
"D - The first thing that comes to mind is that this is very warming. It has a such a heavy boozy presence that I would have trouble downing many of these in a sitting (never mind the actual abv that would knock me on my ass in a hurry). This isn't a bad brew mind you, but did not meet my expectations. A little rough around the edges."
"The mouthfeel is very bubbly and effervescent. Finishes crisp with a lingering barley sugar taste left over. Its not too drinkable with this high of an abv. A good beer to split with a few friends. As far as my overall impression of this one, for its style--it seems there are much better examples. Good but nothing to seek out."
"D :: Whoa - one is enough for me. Overly sweet to continue drinking (unless you've got a sweet-tooth), but darn good!"
"Overall, this is a damn fine beer. I wish the alcohol was hidden a bit more, but this more of a personal preference than a real criticism. I wouldn't hesitate to drink this again. Just watch out for the 10.5% abv, it'll kick your ass if you're not careful!"
"Overall, this is a much higher quality brew than I expected. The most impressive thing was the outstanding floral character of the hops and the surprisingly full body for the style. It was close to some of the lighter stouts. A must have for certain."
"Many thanks to Aaron for sharing this wonderful beer."
"My aggressive pour created a brilliant tan head that eventually faded on top of a ruby-brown body. Alcohol looms over fruit, caramel, and dry hops in the nose. The taste has a ton of caramel to go with anise, and dark fruit. The mouthfeel is full bodied and dry. Fantastic beverage."
"Luscious and creamy, this is a beer, albeit strong, that I could drink alot of. Fantastic."
"Sweet Chelsea Monday."
"D: I could try and drink a few of these in a night and it would be a grand night indeed but at 10.5% abv I would prolly end up sleeping on the floor. I will buy this one whenever I can find it."
"This was recommended to me by my friend ""cypressbob", who just recently returned from Amsterdam, where he had tried it. This turned out to be spot on!...thanks mate!...highly recommended!"
"Drinkability- This dude is strong. Drank this on an empty stomach right before lunch (may regret that, but I still have a bottle of Beatification and Stone 2006 Old Gaurdian to consume before the day is over). Quite the tasteful one and worthy of considerable praise. Will have to find a large bottle of this. Still trying to figure out what bottle I am going to break open once my child is born in March...this ain't a bad prospect. Again, will have to steal the Rachel Ray catch phrase...""YUMMO""!"
"reasonably light with strong sweetness but also pretty boozy, good drinkability, but not great."
"High alcohol ensures that I do not drink this one too quickly. However. for the high ABV it is quite drinkable. There are too many excellent Belgians available for me to return to this one for a long time."
"A light brown head formed but faded relatively fast. The coloration was a very nice chocolate brown with some pleasing gradations, looking a bit like cider and sometimes wine. Some vinegar-like sourness found its way into the nose, which was also reminiscent of cider and cherries. The taste was, well, absolutely fantastic! A nice balance of malts and alcohol persisted, with caramel, cider, apples, rum, and maple tastes. In some ways, this reminded us of Chimay. The mouthfeel was thick and delicious; carbonation just right. Of course, this is a fairly heavy, alcoholic, dessert-like beer and so a bit less drinkable, but let me tell you that, aint stoppin me. My buddy suggested warm apple-pie a la mode as a pairing, and I think that sounds great. Van Steenberge once again ladies and gentlemen!"
"Overall, a very impressive brew. I will definitely have this again very soon to see what else I can add to this review. Amazingly drinkable given the ABV. Certainly one of the best in this style."
"Mouthfeel is nice and frothy but still drinkable."
"Nice tan head on this beer. Malt aroma hits you hard after pouring. The first sip smacked of the 10.5% abv right off the bat, but seemed to settle down after several more (sips), but the warming feeling as it flows down the esophagus is actually nice. The taste is slightly sweet and pleasant. It's a decent beer, but I've always felt that higher OG beers detract from the flavor a bit. No different with this one, but still a very drinkable beer."
"Overall Impression: Fantastic! Served on tap at the Staminee De Garre with a side of mild cheese, simply heaven on earth. One of the best beers of my Belgian trip!"
"Crimson, with a big white head. not much odor, some alcohol noticeable. ethanol is the main flavor of this beer...it hangs out in your mouth along with a sweet flavor like unfermented malts. alcohol hits hard with this sucker. it is a real bastard. mouthfeel quite thick. not easy to drink because of the alkee-hol. unfortunately it packs a punch without any real desireable flavor to go with it. an experience but not necessarily a delicious one."
"Ultra smooth, with an immediate warming quality in the mouth, imparted by the high alcohol. Alcohol is cut by fresh dark ripe fruit (cherries, plums). Finish is chewy and textured with a long intriguing aftertaste. Not the greatest belgian ever, but this is quite tasty, and worth seeking out. Nicely complex, though marred by too much alcohol presence."
"Taste is very rich. This beer packs a serious punch, chock full of fruitiness. Definitely dark fruit flavours, some breadiness and nuttiness in there, caramel, figs, and a very pleasant yeastiness. Mouthfeel is strange, thick like molasses, very creamy, but very carbonated and zippy as well. I like a tangy mouthfeel so that dosen't really bother me much. Good for dessert or relaxing after dinner. Not one you can chug but one you can enjoy sipping for an hour. Lovely."
"Perhaps I just got a bad one. I am in no way discarding this beer based on this try. I will be buying Gulden Draak again based on my first exhilarating experience with this brew."
"I just got my Mug! Hell yeah."
"Mouthfeel: moderate to low carbonation silky smooth full body definitely makes my top 10"
"A nice dark pour with a bit of head. Smells spicey with a little dark fruit. Tastes nice, but is a touch simple for such a strong belgian. Flavor sticks with the belgian spices and dark fruit and does expand within those tastes. Yes there's a nice figs flavor, but thats it. No alcohol present, and thats inpressive for a 10.5 beer. It's a good dark belgian, but I didn't find anything new or surprising. Reminds me of Chimay Blue."
"Drinkability suffers a bit due to the strong sweetness and the high ABV of 10.5% that becomes more noticeable as the beer warms."
"I have had and reviewed this before about 2 years ago, but a friend of mine gave me one and I figured I revisit it simply because my palate may have changed a bit. Poured a red/orange/copper colour with a bit of chill haze. Khaki foamy head subsided to a patchy frost in only 40 seconds or so. The smell is very sweet with lots of stewed fruit, a bit of candy sugar, and lots of alcohol. Smells fantastic. The taste is quite good, with the exception of a very pronounced bitterness on the finish that I could do without. Plenty of sweet fruit flavour profiles present here. Also, they seemed to do a wonderful job concealing the 10.5%abv. Mouthfeel is fabulous with an amazing carbonation. It's perfect. It's enough to ""stir the senses", but it isn't offensive and it doesn't ""sting"". I have had plenty of good beers before with a pleasant level of carbonation, but this is really nice. Even though the high abv is concealed well, it is still a big beer, but considering what it is, I still think drinkability gets a 4."
"Overall: A nice sweet, spicy and strong dark ale."
"D-This beer has nice dark malt flavors and the alcohol helps keep it in check."
"Mouthfeel is supple and succulent but there is some alcohol burn in the throat and chest hence a hit in drinkability. Great belgian!!"
"Poured out of its short and stubby white painted 11.2oz bottle into a tulip glass. Body is dark brown with a monsterous head with great retention that produced lacing throughout the duration of the drink. Smell is sweet dark fruits (plumas and raisens) and alcohol. Taste is fruity with a potent alcohol bite dominating the very dry finish. This brew definately gets better as it warms up in the glass. While it is not an absolutely stellar brew, it sure does hold its own as a great beer."
"11.2 ounce bottle."
"man i love the draak, of of belgiums best exports, a world class beer."
"in alcohol."
"sweet and incredibly pleasant. candi sugar and prunes appear once again in the flavor, with a touch of sweetness and alcohol in the finish. sweet but in a subtle, enjoyable way. prickly carbonation and a medium mouthfeel. nothing incredibly adventurous about it, but it could be a regular dessert-type sipping beer."
"Who doesn't love this bottle?! It pours out dark red/brown with a big off-white head with some staying power. The strongest scent I could detect was, strangely, rootbeer! It doesn't taste like a rootbeer of course. It's more like a roasty wine. Very smooth though. And pretty drinkable, but not entirely my style."
"Pours dark auburn with minimal cream colored head and moderate carbonation. Smells of faint spice, fresh malt; not an overwhelming nose for a Belgian but definitely smells fresh and inviting. Mouthfeel is very heavy, the weight of the ale virtually sinking down on the tongue; dense tingling carbonation Tastes of coriander, licorice, a bit of hops and alcohol at the finish. Overall, the alcohol is not overwhelming tastewise but will certainly creep up on you. This is a find Belgian easily consumed in moderation due to the availability in smaller 11.2 oz bottles, although in my area these are less frequently found than their bomber counterparts."
"Opened and poured the 330ml bottle dated best before 08/06/07. Slighly dark brown colour with lots of head. The smell is of sweet wheat with a light trace of alcohol. The initial taste is of a sugar like sweetness. This is followed by plunge of slightly smokey raisiny taste. The aftertaste is slightly bitter and quite tart, a tartness similar to the white layer of Brie cheese. The alcohol taste is well camouflaged, but its definately there. I wished I hadn't knew that this beer had 10.5% alcohol content before I tried it."
"-Oelergud"
"Dark amber/caramel in color with a creamy tan head. Smell is fruity and spicy with some rubbing alcohol twards the bottom of the glass. Taste is fairly boozey, not well masked for a belgian, and very sweet, with some rough yeast flavors as well as fruit and spices. Mouthfeel is real heavy, not enough carbonation, but has a mellow charecter because of that. Overall, not my favorite. Seems like a lot was sacrificed at the expense of an extra 1% in the ABV, but still a fairly enjoyable brew."
"A little ""too"" drinkable for this amount alcohol."
"overall i felt that this was an excelent rich beer and will definatly get it again"
"D: A bit strong, but nice drinkablility overall. Lacking the complexity to make it a top beer in its class."
"I poured this beer improperly, because an accident has left me without the use of my left hand. Colour looks like tanned leather and dry apples. HUGE head due to improper pour. After 10 minutes, it subsides to about 2 fingers of tanned, dense foam. Smells of caramem malts, citrus(lemon? grapegruit?), spices and... the smell of a mowed lawn about 4 hours and the cut grass has dried in the sun. Big malt and candy sugar taste, with some maple syrup. Very sweet. Any sweeter, and it'd be nauseating. Mouthfeel is thick and creamy, with an almost syrupy texture. Very drinkable and goes great with a heavy meal of beef wellington."
"Drinkability: I definitely appreciate this one more than the first time I tried it, 2 1/2 years ago. It is a solid and delicious example of BSDA, a style crowded with so many great beers, this one definitely brings it's own qualities to the table, and doesn't dissapoint."
"D - A bit too heavy to have more than 2 or 3."
"Easy to drink but take it easy and savor it a bit. I recommend this to lovers of strong ale...Cheers!"
"Yum, Yum, the Gulden Draak is certainly a beverage taste treat. Pours a nice dark cloudy color. The head is off-white and plentiful. The smell is malty. The taste is malty sweetness, There is a malty after taste, but this does not really distract from the overall pleasure of this brew. Highly drinkable at relatively high ABV, be warned and enjoy!"
"One of the benefits of Beer Advocate is finding out about beers such as this one, which I probably would never have tried on my own. This beer poured a cloudy brown color with a small head. It had a sweet fruit odor with a little malt in there. Wonderful taste: sweet, dark fruit with some hops. Slightly noticeable alcohol. A very robust beer. Eminently drinkable, but at 10.5%ABV, you've got to take it easy."
"Very nice."
"Impressive"
"11.2 oz brown stubby bottle painted white with no freshness date. Pours a dark amber with a good frothy 2 finger head and very ggod lace. Good strong malt aromas with some sherry and brandy like aromas. Dried dark fruits - raisins etc. Again with big malt flavors and dried dark fruts. Alcohol is present but not overpowering. Sticky on the lips and warming all the way down. Definate winter beer. Creamy and smooth. Not a beer to gulp but for one with an ABV of this magnitude it is very easy to drink. Tasty and well made."
"It's rich, very rich. Chocolate coated fruit, I'll get back to you on the particulars someday. Dark brown sugar but no burnt toffee. The alcohol steps up and says hello. Very fiery but the dragon's breath hath no boot polish."
"Drinkability: A tad heavy, and the elevated ABV is somewhat prohibitive, but besides that this is very drinkable."
"Cheers!"
"Dark dark rusty golden with a big head of slightly off-white head that hangs around forever and ever. Aromas of dark Belgian candi sugar, spicy yeast complexity, alcohol, fruits, and more. Taste is fruity and boozy with a very sweet caramelized burnt sugar, sort of creme brulee thing going on. Very nice, but after a while a bit much. Mouthfeel is sweet and heavy, syrupy and almost cloying, and the drinkability suffers a bit after time. This is a very nice and intense dark tripel...but it's just so damn sweet after a while that it is not my favorite..."
"Ok, so it's 10.5%, but I find this to be easily drinkable. Not a lot, not as a session beer, but there isn't a day in the year I would turn it away. Absolutely delicious."
"Worth a try, I could see it being a favorite for some."
"Edit: Had this on tap a year later, and prefer it from the bottle. Bumped up the appearance a notch, too. It tastes richer and sweeter and smells better from a bottle, IMO. Surely more research is required...."
"From the bottle into the appropriately screen printed Gulden Draake Tulip glass. Hazy, murky medium brown appearance let no light pass through. Big head of tan foam, and notes of lace were present. Aromas of spicey sugars and malts, with a tame backbone of earthiness. Taste was quite spicey and sweet. Lots of malty caramel notes, with pronounced spices adding zestiness to the beer. Smooth and rich mouthfeel was mixed with bubbly carbonation, very nice on the palate. The drinkability was just not there for me. This is a well made beer, but not one I think i'd want to revisit."
"Poured a hazy dark reddish-brown color with chunky white head, that lasted throughout the glass, leaving very attractive lacing on the side of the glass. The smell is fantastic with strong dark fruit (prunes, plums, dates, raisins) dominating. Light toasty notes are also present. Taste is strong on fruit and malt with a magnificent creamy feeling that literally coats the inside of the mouth with the strong fruitiness. Absolutely no alcohol flavors to be found. Nice carnonation also adds to the creaminess. Finish malty and fruity with a hint of hoppy bitterness, but very little. This was an extremely enjoyable beer, The drinkability was too good for a beer of this strength."
"Ahhh ... one of my very favorites and a culprit in my love of dark, strong Belgian ales. For the purposes of this review, I poured the ale into a Gulden Draak goblet from a 750 ml white coated bottle. Poured a deep, rich burgundy color that highlights red in the light. Displays a huge, mountainous head of light tan. Nose clubs you with dark, hearty fruits and spice. Dark raisins, cherries, and dates with a yeast bath. A special sweetness is present here as well ... a bit candy-like due to the use of Belgian Candi sugar in the bottle conditioning. Slightly alcoholic nose is present. Palate is extraordinary ...so complex. All of fruits mollases malt, and alcohol - rum like in some ways. The suprise ... this ale is rather hoppy, creating a marvelous balance in the flavor profile. This is master work, really. Full bodied and agressively carbonated, avoiding any semblance of a cloying effect. Though hoppier than many Belgian Strong Darks, Gulden Draak is not at all bitter. Finishes very smooth with a touch of residual sweetness. Gulden Draak is one of my favorites of all time. I love the name, the bottle, the beer ... I could go on and on. This is a world class ale. You need this beer!"
"D - Very drinkable, I will buy this again and again. Not overly sweet but not bitter at all. Nicely balanced, hops are not obvious as they are in IPAs but they certainly round out the sweetness of the amount of malt necessary to get an alcohol of 10.5%"
"Drinkability: This is an eminently drinkable ale, but the 10.5% abv is a dealbreaker, too much alcohol makes me sleepy..."
"To me, this beer is just as a tripel should be. It pours cleanly without too much foam, and smells simply wonderful - caramel and spice and minty herbs. Dark and sweet, more like a dubbel, really, but with the kick of a tripel. I frequently compare the taste of dulden draak to that of sweet wine. There is no hiding the 10+% acohol, but the flavors ride well on top of that base. Just the right amount of very bright hops (mint and lemongrass) and sweet, buttery, syrupy malt (black tea and cornsyrup, if not chocolate). Despite the sweetness, there's not sticky mouthfeel, and it drinks like red wine - that is to say very easily, especially if you don't mind the high alcohol. This beer could not be better balanced."
"Big mouthfeel, good carbonation, really coats the inside of your mouth. There's no doubt you're drinking a 10.5, but the alcohol isn't overwhelming because of all of rich malts. Having one of these for desert pretty regularly would make my mouth happy."
"A good beer for every now and then, but not one I'll keep going back to."
"drinkablilty: one bomber was good enough for me. felt full once i was done. like a hearty meal"
"I remember liking this better the first time I had it at Smokeless Joe in Toronto, but still quite good. I've got another bottle someone gave me for Christmas too, so we'll see how it goes the third time around."
"This is definitely something I could drink a lot of, but slowly. This is a beer to savor, not chug."
"I beleive that I could drink this beer till I fell off of my stool."
"Drinkability: Well, nose is off the hook, amazing. Taste, though, is too much, waaay too sweet for me. Still, at this ABV, you'll feel good about it in the end -- trust me. Enjoyable in moderation."
"Overall = This is a great Belgian dark ale. Drinkable, delicious, beautiful. Quite possibly the best I've tried so far."
"The alcohol presence is not hidden, but the different flavor profiles are enriched by it. A nice, dynamic strong Belgian."
"D: Quite good, especially considering the strength."
"Malty, sweet, easy-drinking, heavy on the booze, this Belgian's pretty rad IMO. Wish I'd bought another."
"Drinkability is very good, especially considering the strenghth of this brew. Very enjoyable."
"Drinkability: OK, here is where I got in trouble. I liked this offering on tap so much, I enjoyed 3 large, Belgium tulip glasses in less than 2 hours. It was my birthday and everyone was buying me a round, so I couldn't resist. Long story short, the Drak kicked my assk. I should have known better to do a session with a potent brew like this, but it was pleasure and then pain the next morning. Overall an enlightening experience one I won't forget!"
"Pours out of the cool ceramic- like bottle a murky red tinged cloufy brown with tan head. Smells of noble hop, slight apricot and apple. Taste is really something- caramel, toast, fig, sherry. Very malty and filling in the mouth- I mean, tremeandous mouthfeel. Definitely a little bite and warmth when you swallow. Mine had a tiny but of harshness that I'm sure would mellow if I was a little more patient and gave it some age."
"If I could get my hands on it, I would drink this brew quite often. Very nice."
"This is a very nice beer thats a lot of fun to drink. The intense carbonation and high ABV unfortunately detract from the drinkability."
"This beer pours a nice finger width of head. It's a nice dark color that looks frothey on the top and inviting. It holds a good lacing and smells like a sweet and hoppy beer. It tastes sweet and hoppy with a wonderful balance of both flavors. It feels like silk and slides down my throat very easily. It's a very drinkable, an excellent beer."
" To me this is a real classic and on the must try list for everybody. I'm pretty sure it's the same yeast as Trois Pistoles, but this is a bigger, more maltly beer, more likeable, a more . Both are favorites of mine. i drank this a bit colder than cellar temp."
"Drinkability: I'll definitely be trying this again, as the on tap brew was a great experience. Maybe next time it will be from the bottle."
"Beer to the point. True greatness. Ill be picking up a few 750s of this one."
"Less wine-like than some and wonderfully fulfilling. Very nice."
"The taste was enjoyable. I was reminded of a honey like quality in each sip. There was a subtle sweetness. Overall, a good drinking experience. I will be looking on the shelves for this beer in the future."
"330 mL stubby with no freshness date needed due to the ABV and the painted bottle. Pours a reddish color that is bright red when light shines through. It has a 3 finger rocky head that pokes above the rim of the tulip and leaves a lot of foamy lace. Toward the end I poured in the rest of the bottle, which gave it a murky, more brown color. It smells of raisins and orange predominantly, but has banana, sour apples, pepper, melons?, bubblegum, and maybe some hops. The first sip is heavy and very sweet with a touch of metal, which is not quite what I was expecting, but let's work with it. As I drink, there are also raisins, apples, cloves, pepper, oranges, and a sweetness that is still there, strong, but not as cloying as it could be considering how malty this brew is. The body has more initial carbonation than I would have thought, but it smooths and becomes near flat by the end of the glass. The drinkability suffers not from the high ABV, which is only evident in a slight warming sensation, but from the strong sweetness. However, it is still a good beer and it's getting me excited about the other Belgians I have stashed away"
"Perhaps this can best be described as a dark imperial tripel. What it lacks in sweet-bitter balance, it regains in its balance of light and dark. In heaven, at the annual golf tournament, at the 19th hole, while celebrating a round of perfect hole-in-ones, you forgot your wallet, but guess what? Jesus buys a round, and its Gulden Drak, and all you can think to say is thank you lord."
"Definitely glad I have this on-tap at my local bar..a Belgian ale of standout caliber. Kick ass."
"Long live the Golden Dragon!!"
"Pours a murky mahogany brown with a short off-white head in my sweet new Schlitz chalice. That's right - Schlitz chalice. Anyhow, nose is warm and spicy with apple cinnamon and nutmeg over Belgian yeast. Tastes like chilled sparkling apple cider - winter spices, fresh pressed apples, figs, and some light bready yeast. Quite sweet overall, not a whole lot of bitter to balance it, but I didn't mind. Like a much more refined version of New Glarus' Apple Ale. The 10.5% is almost nonexistent, expertly hidden without bitterness. Another pleasant surprise for the night after DFH's 90 Minute IPA. Good beer night for me. Wish this wasn't so damn expensive, so a rare treat for me that I will surely enjoy again."
"poured 330 ml white bottle with no freshness date. pours dark dark brown with a hint of orange around the edges. small head w/ good retention. minimal lace. nose has malts, yeast, raisins (?), and super alcohol. however, the most prevalent thing in the smell is definately the apricots. sweet malty flavor. the malts remind me vaguely of milk chocolate. really almost to complex to put into words, you've really gotta try this to understand the taste. this is totally full of flavor! definately has an alcohol taste to it, but it's not strong at all."
"I highly recommend Gulden Draak."
"D - This is strong and sweet, yet I had no trouble drinking it. I tasted it before and had to have a full one for myself. Very nice. I just wish it were cheaper."
"Overall - An excellent dark ale... one of my favourites..."
"I have been waiting to try this beer for a long time and it surpassed my expectations. I highly recommend this beer."
"I most definitely could not drink more than one of the 330 mL bottles of this even if I wanted to."
"A treat for all the senses. Looks dark ruby to dark brown in color, nicely carbonated for a Belgian. 1/2 inch head, laced wiell, and shows nice legs (sounds sexual). Aromas and flavors meld together nicely. Thick and creamy with barley malt, caramel, toffee, port wine, good hop flavor and balance, noticable alcohol throughout. Full rich body--would make a great after dinner beer. Finishes sweet, alcoholic, and tingly. It's a sipper, but worth the patience. I had this on tap durring the winter and it was more creamy and more refreshing."
"alcohol sting in the end is a bit of a bitch, but sweetness is right there to assist with the balance. a little overcarbonated, but goes down easy regardless. notmuch about this beer to pick on, i'm really stretching to find a flaw. i can still taste it in my cheeks and it makes me want more. what a superb beer."
"High alcohol content is fairly well hidden but at 10.5% its impossible to hide. This one warmed me up good."
"Overall: A friend gave me this one. Never heard of it. Now I will confidently rank it as one of the best beers that I have ever tasted, Belgian or other."
"What a fucking treat this one was....I must have more of this...I must move to Belgium soon."
"Pours a dark brown color with a big off white head. The aroma is sweet with caramel tones. The taste is as big as the smell. Dark fruits, caramel, and alcohol. The mouthfeel is thick with low carbonation. Overall, this is a pretty good brew. Definitely worth a try."
"So tasty, almost in between a pale and dark, like a tripel mixed with a strong dark ale or dubbel"
"Drinkability: even at 10.5% ABV I'd gladly drink several of these bad boys (11.2 oz. bottles). Not the greatest of the style but well up the ladder and well worth the time."
"From the Belgium sampler pack. 330 ml/11.2 oz bottle. Pours dark brown coffee color with light brown, copious, foamy head that fades slowly. Perhaps some yeast residue but hard to tell due to dark color. Very few bubbles precipitate. Nose is quite pleasant with a pronounced scent of fruit, perhaps cherry or strawberry or watermelon or some similarly sweet fruit. Initial taste is fruity yet slightly bitter. The alcohol is there but at 10.5% ABV, it is remarkably well masked, or perhaps integrated. Crisp, bubbly mouthfeel. Slight metallic iron/blood finish. Overall interesting and remarkably drinkable for a triple-malt, but not a favorite. Rated at a 90, Ill have to give this one a second try. Perhaps Im not ready for this beer yet, or perhaps this particular bottle had a bad metallic aftertaste not characteristic of others."
"Purple color with a large dense dark tan head. Lacing around the sides. Aroma is sweet with toffee and plum and chocolate. The transcends to the flavor. Chocolate dominates in my mind. Roasted coffee is there as well but is soon tempered by the plummy flavors. There might be some candi sugar in here as well. Alcohol smooths and dries in the finish but I'm still left with a little residual sweetness. The best part of this beer was its body. Really luxurious, vicous, and smooth. It made the beer a quality drinker. I bet this could age really well but too sweet as of now."
"Appearance is a cloudy mahogany with some foam that lasts a while. Aroma has citrus and plums, mixed with toffee malt. Initial taste contains a biting jalapeno pepper, honey and beef broth. Terrific  sounds like a great combination, doesnt it? Finish is strange, with ethanol and Earl Grey vying for dominance. Um, Ill pass on this one. Might be good with certain foods."
"Hazy reddish brown with a very light brown head, slightly rocky. Aromas of alcohol, rich malts, ripe fruit, and a little spiciness. Very sweet, like candy sugar, with dark fruits, alcohol warmth and a bit of pepper at the finish. Medium/full body and moderate carbonation, just a bit sticky with residual sugar."
"Darkish, murky, russet brown, with amber edges, topped by a two finger cushion of light khaki head that laces nicely. Nose is tangy and oaky, with caramelized brown sugar, yeast, light fruits, and faint pepper. Intense malt flavors up front: sugary sweet tropical fruits (banana, pineapple juice, kiwi) dominate, but are somewhat tempered by a toasted bitterness. Sweetness easily wins out. Brown sugar and caramel flavors mix with yeast. Light spiciness noticeable near the finish. Finish is sweet, yeasty, and very warming. Full-bodied with a near syrupy consistency toward the finish. Somehow avoids being cloying, but very sweet nonetheless. Oh, and quite good!"
"Mouthfeel & Drinkabillity: Full and thick, yet smooth and creamy. The alcohol has a warming effect, but is otherwise hidden really well. The 10,5% really doesn't show, and the beer is -surpisingly- not very heady and amazingly drinkable."
"The mouthfeel is full enough for the style, but the alcohol and carbonation make it a bit awkward. I love BSDAs, but this one doesn't do it for me. My next round would be something else."
"This pours with a nice carmely-brown color, almost opaque, or at least very dense. The head is off-white and at least a couple of inches which settles to about 1/2 inch after some time. The smell is sweet with hints of fruit and perhaps cake, perhaps even a little nutty. I'm not so crazy about the first sip, all I'm tasting is alcohol. Second sip I the sweet malt takes over. The aftertaste is powerful and not unlike that of a good port, albeit a bit smokey and most noticably not a port. Long term after-taste is almost astringant and I can't help but want something else to wash it away. The mouthfeel is odd to me. It looks like it should be heavier, and it's anything but light, but it isn't heavy, either. Confused? So am I. Very complex. Perhaps too much for my taste. I think I'll have to try a few more before I have a solid opinion."
"330ml belgian ""stubby"" bottle..1 year 3 months old. Poured an opaque brandy-red color. Tight mocha cap, soft carbonation. Nose is tart-sweet like mulled apple wine with rasins and some mustiness with light chocolate tones. Viscous body, vinous character....Wonderfully complex flavor substantial malt spine mingles with plumbs, figs, cocoa, tangerene peal bitters. Finishes wet and very brandy like in character. Warming. A great Belgian warming ale with substantial complexity."
"This is one of my favorites. Don't miss it. The complex flavor will force you to recall that there's just nothing like a strong Belgian ale."
"Classy and a benchmark for the style, this is an all-around selection of goodness in a bottle. I am splitting a glass with my girlfriend pre-dinner. It's starting the evening off on a most sultry note."
"Mouthfeel is quite awesome. It seems almost chewy while still seeming light bodied in a way. Drinkability is brought down a bit with how much the alcohol sensation lingers. Not a session beer by anymeans, but something Ill be sure to return to."
"Taste/Drinkability: A nice malty flavor that is a little bit too strong and striking for my tastes."
"Mouthfeel is large, full, and sticky. Yet is finishes with a deliacte dryness that is unexpected. Not an everyday beer for sure. But a welcome change when you're in the mood."
"Draught@ Sharp Edge Creekhouse: They had this listed on the menu as a ""Barleywine"" which is obviously wrong. This pours a cloudy, reddish brown color. It had a fairly large off-white head. This was a very nice beer. The aroma has notes of yeast, alcohol, caramel, fruits, and probably a lot of other things. It is very rich. The taste follows suit. This is a wonderful variation of a Tripel. Full bodied and smooth."
"The main reason I gave this a 3.5 in drinkability is mostly due to its sweet nature. It's like eating too much pecan pie. It tastes really good at first bite but it is just too rich to eat the whole pie. I will have to say that like wine, it gives you a great relaxed feeling."
"This is a beer for the one beer a night plan. I cannot imagine tasting anything after this one. There is nothing subtle about this brew. It assaults your senses and takes no prisoners. Like sipping a fortified wine or a dry cordial. A night cap of a brew if there is a such a class."
"Liquid pumpernickel. The beer looks like liquified pumpernickel and smells like it. Filtered mud. There was a thick and stubborn head on top. The nose is bready and yeasty. The taste is very fruity--but dried and earthy fruits like raisins, prunes, apples, apricots and bananas. Also, just a hint of honey. A very full bodied beer that clings to the palate.Would make a great beer to go with a dessert tart."
"Gulden Draak (I can't say the name without sliding into a bad Scottish accent) is a beer that grew on me substantially over the course of the bottle. When--not if--I drink my next one, I'll allow it to warm and will gently mix the bottle before opening to get bring the good stuff into play from the start. I'm sorry I doubted you GD, you're pretty G-d good after all."
"I'll need to try this again to really get a handle on it. Happily."
"Am I confused? I expected the Piraat and the Draak to be exactly the opposite in color than they really are. The Draak pours a nice mahoghany color with a slightly off white head. It has a wonderful malty aroma, a blend of sweet caramel and nutty Munich malt, and a nice yeast finish, that reminds me more of a lager than a Belgian ale. The taste is similar to the aroma, malty with some bitterness, and surprisingly no sign of that 10.5% it lists on the label. The body is also good as well not dry as one might expect with a strong Belgian. Overall this is an excellent beer that is highly drinkable, especially for a big beer."
"The ABV is questionable for this reason, because it's well hidden and very, very slightly felt afterwards. this is an excellent brew. best i've had in a while now."
"The flavor can be overpowering—I can’t see myself drinking more than a single stubby of this (the 10.5% ABV also factors in), but this is a truly great beer that everybody should try."
"gulden draak pours walnut brown with a huge rocky head that stays huge for 5-10 minutes before falling to a 1/4 inch towards the bottom. the smell of tart apples is big with strong sweetness and a bit of bubble-gum? taste is almost cidery. alcohol is present in the back but, a over 10.00 abv would you expect anything else. mouthfeel is moderately carbonated with a drying effect from the tartness and alcohol. heavy body. drinkabilty is high and dangerous considering the abv.. a delicious triple."
"%10.5 ABV. An exceptionally well balanced Belgian."
"A two and a half finger foamy head was produced and went down relatively slowly with practically no lacing. The color was a nice ruby with just a hint of brown. Some cloudiness and bubbles from the bottom. The smell was peach and strawberry with a sour backbone. The taste was spicy, hint of cherry and strawberry, very slight, and clove. Wine-like lightness and feel. Mouthfeel was not heavy or overbearing but left a nice coating in the back of the throat. Not that bad at all."
"This is a simply wonderful brew and a new a favorite."
"Dark cloudy brown with a nice creamy head that lasts and sheets the side of the glass. Very fruity aroma of over ripe pears and banannas. There is also plenty of spice, mostly cinnamon and clove. Slightly sweet body. Caramel malt. Fairly creamy body. Not bad."
"Hazy. Amber in hue, it is darker brown in the middle and tawny around the edges. The head was rocky, easily two fingers in height. The beige foam sat there like a rock, head retention was excellent to say the least. A modest, tight cap lasted the entire consumption. It was welcomed company. The subsequent lacing was spotty and fairly widespread. In honesty the appearance isnt ground breaking in anyway but it is pleasant to look at. Hey, its beer! The nose has always been charming. Chocolate malts provide a lovely foundation that allows an array of spices, fruits, and phenolic characteristics to stand on. There are hints of sweetness upfront with figs, lavender, raisins, tropical fruit, alcohol, and cherries in the middle. Traces of medical qualities and even some herbalness, it is these aromas that I adore in this bouquet, as they really round out the nose. They are strongest at the finish. Moderate potency. The nose is articulate and I can smell, and thus enjoy, every little detail. Sure I wish it was louder but I cant complain. The palate is lovely. Wonderful. It seems so simple but it is beautiful. At first there is a heavy, sweet maltiness that has influences of chocolate and cola. Cherries, prunes, and raisins are soaked in brandy and then they are added to a chocolate purée laced with medicinal spiciness. Clove with hints of banana. Band-Aids. Caramel is also in the mix. Hot alcohol that is close to being distracting, but as is, it adds a fantastic dimension to this beer. There isnt much hiding the fact this beer clocks an abv over ten. The finish is juicy with dark fruits, alcohol heat, spice, and the medicinal qualities. Hot aftertaste, like sucking on rubbing alcohol and Band-Aids; who do that would taste so good? I really like this beer, is it the most complex Belgian Ive tasted? No. Does it strike all the right cords with me? Yes. Medium-full in body, the carbonation is quite active but it feels natural and it works well for this beer, the mouthfeel is pleasant, I like the creaminess. I also like the heat that cuts the sweetness; at times this beer actually seems dry. Exceedingly drinkable, this beer is the perfect nightcap or serve it with a chunk of cheese and a hand of red grapes. I really wish this beer were available in Nebraska; of course it is not. I purchased this bottle as part of a sampler-pack in Ames, IA. Thankfully it can be had in Des Moines or Iowa City. I need to have this on-hand more often. It is a unique treat with enough uniqueness to make me want to come back for more. Recommended"
"11.2 oz white bottle from a Van Steenberge sampler box. Served at cellar temperature into a chalice, it pours a clear, cola brown body with a small, large-bubbled head that left behind minimal lace. Aroma has overripe bananas, prunes, figs, raisins, a hint of spicy clove and pepper, and fusel alcohol. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with effervescent carbonation. The taste features candy sugar, prunes, nearly rotten bananas, danky yeast, clove, and warming alcohol. Finishes slightly bitter, leaving a feeling of alcohol infused prune juice. I really didn't care a lot for this one."
"I love the white opaque bottle with black label, very curious as to what lurks inside. Pours a dark cloudy mahogany, with a big sinister off-white head. Aroma was floral and fruits, with a very seductive alcohol vapour that is very appropriate somehow. Taste was strong caramel, with a lot of warming alcohol as well as dark fruits and toffee. Very smooth, and while the alcohol is prevalent, it was also very tasteful and appropriate to such a sinister brew. I was almost positive at one point I could see the alcohol vapours on my breath. I want to find a big bottle of this for New Year's..."
"Pouring from the faux-ceramic white bottle with the strangely Asian-looking black label, Draak poured beautifully into my abbey-style glass, revealing an extrememly rich-toned beer. At first I seen light ruby, and a dark brown with hints of red, with the slightest touch of light orange.Thick, sedimentary and caramel-thick in body-appearance. A mocha-coloured head formed, which was solid and thick, but was not very consistent throughout my drinking it. Swirling the glass from time to time kept it creamy. Patchy lace, sticky but not screening the glass. The aroma is rather complex, with dark mustiness and phenols dominating. Dark fruits, richly sweet malt. Hints of licorice and leather, horehound, medicinal syrup. Prunes and dates also were quite easy to smell. Initially, the aroma with the glass a good distance from my nose was mouthwatering fruitiness; in closer, the alcohol is immediately evident. Later I sense sourdough and sharp blue cheese. Beastly malt, huge alcohol, and yeast. The flavour at first was metallic, like iron, followed by intense fruit like a cherry brandy, or mollasses. A finish of yeast and oiliness, the everpresent alcohol, and a great deal of bitterness for me. The aftertaste is initially all sweetness, but after a few seconds it leaves the throat very dry and dusty-feeling, which is why I rated mouthfeel and drinkability quite low. The feeling left in my mouth disappointed me: alcohol combined with extreme must is far too dry; mouth-puckering muskiness. Dry tannins as in a rich red wine. This beer literally seemed to purge all saliva from my mouth, and I could actually feel my glands pumping to hydrate my mouth. For me personally, this greatly reduces is drinkability value. Others may not have the same experience. The least taste is in the middle, though it remains full-bodied and resiny. Oily yet gaseous in the mouth. The lees were less sweet, with a strong iron taste. I enjoyed this beer up until the mouth could not handle the dry dustiness. Too much alcohol in the character of it."
"I wish I could get this on it's own instead of in a gift set with a bunch of other beers."
"This a beer that I order when I bring people to try good beers at the Sharp Edge for the first time. Most people are impressed by the 20oz. tulip shaped glass with the golden dragon on it, plus I know that the imbiber is going to get happy real quick. Appearance: Deep mahogany huge velvety tan light brown head extravagant fine lacing very detailed and webbed. Aroma: Deep mulilayered with fruit and fusel alcohol contains a nice balance between sweetness and the herbal hop profile. Taste: Mild chocolate notes with raisin and apple tones that come out slightly caramelized ripened fruit with a toasted nut edge to it all with a slight spiciness that brings the mouth a full orgy of flavors. Mouthfeel: Medium bodied effervescent a true gem in the realm of Belgian beer. Drinkability: Dangerously easy to consume try to keep it to just one of these bad boys in a sitting, definitely one of my all time favorite Belgians."
"This is a dark brown ale with mahogony highlights and a foamy dark tan head that leaves some lace. The aroma has a plummy rich dried fruit characteristic that sheilds most of the high octane alcohol from your nose. That same sweet dried fruit characteristic starts up the flavor and blends nicely with the peppery hop finish. Then you get that tummy warming alcohol sensation. Yum."
"Well, despite its name, this beer pours a deep amber color, with ruby highlights when held up to the light. The head is midsized and light brown in color. The aroma is of dark fruit (plum and raisin), rum, and a sort of spiciness that reminds me a bit of coriander. The beer is fairly well carbonated as it fizzes on my tongue. It is sweet and fruity with raisin definitely dominating the fruit component, but notes of figs and prunes are evident as well. The combination of the sweetness and fruitiness gives this beer a certain richness that I was not expecting (you can tell it has been quite a while since I last had this). Overall this is quite a tasty beer, nothing that really makes it stand out and perhaps a bit too sweet, but it is a well built tasty beer."
"Nice white botle; great name.... what to expect? Nice darkbrown colour with a lightbrown head that lasts. Malty nose that tends to sweet and hardly any caramel but litle hops. Tast is sweet and full bodied and aftertast starts sweet but finishes bitter. To sweet( and alcoholic) to drink more than one."
"There's one inch of fine, tan foam over a hazy, dark brown beer with reddish highlights. Sugar and bread in the strong nose. Is that figs? Toffee? Burnt caramel? A strong, sweet, grapesy/raisiny front gives way to a full, fizzy, sweet middle. Almost sweet chocolate. Hot alcohol in the finish with loads of overripe fruit. Bready burps. This is a very strong tasting beer. It's sweet, fruity, bready. Almost too sweet for me, but very good."
"Taste: Caramel, but with a bit of butterscotch diacetyl. Really thich mouthfeel and aftertaste that lingers for a long while. In the land of strong dark ales, I'd put this in the upper middle."
"The appearance is a bit darker than expected with the body being a dark reddish brown crowned by a nice head of off-white foam. The head recedes to a nice lacing engine of about a quarter inch. The nose is of spice notes and fruit and this follows in the flavors. The body is full and creamy, almost of a syrupy nature. The drinkability is hampered by the fullness and ABV."
"Very dark amber, nice head with excellent lacing. Smell was fruity (cherries) and very inviting...entices you to drink. Taste is full and fruity...definte cherry presence imo. There is a richness here that would probably do well if served warm as a winter brew. Mouthfeel is full-bodied and suggests an alcohol presence in its syrupy feel, but the alcohol does not overwhelm. For such a high abv,,,not bad on the drinkability scale, either. Great bottle too..defintely recomemnd."
"This is an enjoyable beer. I cannot imagine why I would ever buy one again, though. I mean it does not go with food, and if we are thinking of an after dinner drink, then port wine or barley wine has my vote."
"High ABV is well hidden."
"I waited a long time to try this one, and I finally grabbed both a 750 and a small bottle. I had the small one a couple of weeks ago, and the 750 tonight. Unfortunately, I really didn't like the flavor that much either time. A strange, almost soy-sauce like taste, different than any Belgian I've had previously. Lots of foam, nice looking glass of beer. Smell doesn't put me off, but that strange taste never really fades. Also, not as rich in body as the true greats of the style. Worth trying (and a cool bottle), but I'm disappointed after the hype."
"Sticky maltiness, a strong bite at first. Once the alcohol numbs your tongue a little bit there's a good bit of fruit there too. This is a great brew, but maybe it was a bit old. Or just the bottled version isn't as good. Either way, I'd not but it again."
"Pours a rich dark amber, orange on the corners. Pours outstanding thick brown-white head that lasts throughout the beer. Smell is potent, malty and sugary. Taste is all right, malty and sweet, with the alcohol becoming a part of the taste. Yet, like many of Brouwerij Van Steenberges beers, I am left wanting more. Drinkable, and a good beer, but for the price I expected more."
"On tap at the Tap Room in Bedford NY. In a Gulden Draak Belgian style glass. Yeehaa, top rated brew on tap in the appropriate glass. This stunning brew pours ruby, brownish, and cloudy. Dark tan head, leaves nice wavy lacing. Exotic nose of cherries, fruit,alcohol,cloves,apricots. Flavor notes figs, raisins,nuts, sweet malts,vanilla,oak, Belgian yeastyness. Can you say complex? Soft mouthfeel, this is terrific stuff, bold flavors, strong and intense. A Belgian lovers dream. Seek this stuff out and enjoy!"
"Must remember to sip. Must remember to sip."
"Final Thought: Despite it's killer looks altogether, it's a solid Belgian ale."
"Rich coppery color with a tan head, smells like fermenting fruit. Superb caramel-sweet, malty and fruity taste with a backhand of alcohol. A chewy and candylike mouthfeel but remarkably mild to no aftertaste, with its light carbonation it goes down easy. If you like sweet, high-abv stuff, this is top-notch."
"The beer pours a dark brown color with a thick frothy off-white head. The aroma is good. It has a nice malty aroma which boasts of Belgian caramel malts and a fruity yeast finish. The taste is good. It has a rich malty flavor that goes down easy and finishes fruity, yet dry with Belgian yeast. It is a smooth beer with a creamy malt palate. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with good carbonation. This is a fine triple. It has good flavor and aroma; a quality brew."
"Beer is good. Happy heavy beering."
"edit: Just have to note that I was back at The Drafting Room in Springhouse to have a bit more with drinking buddy blitheringidiot, and decided to make my Memorial Day weekend much more memorable by taking a growler of it with me! Sorry everyone in this area! That kicked the keg! But man it made me happy!!!"
"The white bottle is very cool looking and the mahogany brown brew inside is equally interesting to look at. It has a massive craggy head with copious lacing left behind. The carbonation is remarkable. A whole universe of tiny pin prick bubbles with bigger ones interspersed. The nose is mainly of fruits, like plums prunes, maybe cherries and Im not sure what else. The taste is dominated by fruity flavors, mostly plum, there are also sherry/port alcohol elements and an interesting yeast character. The hops are very subdued. This beer is quite good but it is definitely not the best Belgian strong ale I have tried, its too malty and sweet (though by no means cloying). The finish is sweetish and somewhat bitter. The ABV is very well concealed. This is still a good beer and I would definitely have it again if given the oppurtunity."
"What a pleasant departure for me! Not sure I would do this very often but a nice change of pace. Served in a brandy snifter type glass which helped bring out the nectar-like aromas. Color is reddish-brown with a nice but not over-powering head. Very silky in the mouth and a sweetness that could get over powering. A good starter or finisher but not sure I'd hang my hat on this one the whole night. If you want a refreshing change, this is a winner. Went great with the chicken quesadillas I had."
"Deep and cloudy chestnut brown with a fair amount of tan foam. Aroma is sweet and spicy. Flavor is spicy with a lot of dark fruit and sweetness barely reigned in by the bitterness. Mouthfeel is a bit syrupy, and with the sweetness has a sticky quality to the aftertaste. Strong but still quite drinkable."
"Pours a dark brown, with just a hint of red. medium sized head that really stays. Good lacing all the way down the glass. Smells extremely odd. Very pungent, spicy, sour. This brew is extremely thick. It just sticks to your mouth and is a slow drinking beer. Its just overpowering how malty it is, how strong the mouthfeel is, and the sweetness. Not very hoppy, has a citrus flavor to it. Also its 10.5% abv, but you can hardly taste the alcohol at all. Definitely worth trying, at least once."
"Notes: At 10.5% abv it holds together quite well as there is enough body to match the alcoholic character. Veal Marsala with Parmesan coated linguini is a great pairing, try using this beer in a redux sauce with mushrooms and shallots over the veal."
"This brew is a thick, cloudy brown/purple colored brew, decent sized tan foam head. Sweet grape, cherry, fruit scent, very nice. This brew is delicious. Lots of different fruit, sweet sugars, alcohol spice, hop bitterness on top of everything. This beer is damn good, and makes me quite interested in this style of beers."
"This is a very interesting beer to drink. Lots of interesting things happening in the aroma and flavour that make it worth savouring. Perhaps a little too much alcohol presence, but quite enjoyable overall."
"Gulden Draak pours ruby brown, almost clear with no traces of yeast?, but a generous sticky head for this ABV. Aroma is vinous, very malty (caramel, butterscotch) with a tickling grapes character melted with ashes. The taste is as sweet as anticipated, very caramelic, but mostly floral clover honey and licorice with a slight medicinal note and more brown sugar toward the finish which is all malt. I couldn't drink too much of this myself, but I appreciate the sipping experience and the medium body fits well. I think this would blend together better being forgotten for a while in a cave. Thanks Martin!"
"Overall, this was a nice brew, and I enjoyed it, but it did not wow me. I guess the balance wasn't quite what I hoped for, and the aroma was disappointing."
"$2.99 a bottle"
"Gulden Draak is another winner from Belgium. Bless those brewers, for they have brought so much beer-laden joy to the world."
"Gulden Draak was served from a white ""ceramic"" coated 330 ml bottle. When poured into a Duvel tulip, a large rough tan head rose up, then settled to become a thick, rich, and creamy blanket, which left extremely thick and sticky lacing when the glass was tilted. The beer itself was a dark and murky reddish-chestnut hue. The nose was big on rich figgy malt, with rich accents of pumpernickel bread, and indecipherable spice. The alcohol was completely hidden in the hearty goodness. The real experience started with the first taste. The beer began with a bold, moderately sweet, spicy, malt base that quickly let loose a wonderfully zippy fig/dried tart fruit explosion at the sides of the tounge. This melted into a spicy peach, rum-nutty, warming finish that lingered long after a sip was take. The dragon was a rollercoaster ride of delicious flavor... no spills just thrills and balanced like a yogi. The mouthfeel was richly smooth and full, but not syrupy or sticky. Completely satisfying and extremely delicious, Gulden Draak is simply one of the finest Belgian SD ales available."
"Drinkable? Just keep them coming Bar Keep!"
"Alcohol becomes screamingly apparent in the finish as all of these other flavors drop off, faint touches of raisins and sulfur lasts through to the next sip. A faint touch of metal is in the final approach."
"Poured into a tulip glass, humungous meaty brownish head formed, possibly due to aforementioned foaming issue. Foam still alive and kicking five minutes later, with extensive lacing. Nice deep reddish-brown color to the beer, which is surprisingly opaque, allowing no light to pass through. Smells of yeast, malt, yeast malt, and alcohol proliferate. Tasting the liquid does not disappoint, tastes reinforce the aromas, and the 10.5% alcohol is not so much tasted as felt, warming your mouth and everything on down the body. An excellent cool weather beer, and, well, wouldn't be so out of place in warmer times either."
"I agree with other reviews that this beer may be best enjoyed after a big meal, as a dessert. While I don't think its big flavor would detract from a good steak or grilled burger, I do believe that the mix just might not fit too well. I strongly recommend Gulden Draak to anyone -- both the newcomers to Belgians and the guys who are knee deep in the rich traditions. What a fantastic beer."
"750ml caged and corked bottle with no apparent date. I love the idea of an absolute lightproof bottle. Poured a very dark garnet/brown color with an almond head that reduced till it sat on top. Initial aroma from the bottle was cotton candy, but when poured it was spicy and like a fresh cut field. The taste was heavy malts and brown sugar with brandy soaked cherries and plums. There were some faint hints of caramel in the finish, perhaps burnt. There was a little hoppiness to the finish, but not much. Alcohol is masked well, making this quite drinkable. A complex ale in a sweet-kinda way, would have liked to see more hops here. But over all it was a great experience that I would love to have again."
"Seemed as if it hadn't fully fermented, almost like malt extract."
"This beer seems to me like a good example of the Belgian strong dark ale style, but does not seem any better or worse than other brands out there, such as Unibroue Maudite."
"Pours a hazy red with some dark orange hints with minor head and lace. Citric smells or orange and lemom with some spice and faint malt. Flavor is much stronger than aroma, peppery with some malty, almost molasses like sweetness. Aftertase has some serious residual sweetness, yet it is not cloying but rather neat sweetness."
"Update  The 2007 is a real gem. It's buttery smooth, shows some killer yeast, and hides every bit of alcohol."
"Amongst the best Belgians brought into the US. Beautifully sweet, and drinking much underneath its ABV, Gulden Draak is simply a fantastic beer, and certainly one that I will have again!"
"Nice beer that I'll be sure to sample on tap when I am in Belgium this summer."
"Never had a dark triple, so I thought this to be a solid ""good"" brew. Dark and fruit driven with moderate headage and generous though not stunning lace. Aromas seemed to focus on dark, fruity caramel-almost burnt sugar like. The taste is odd, while attractive all the while-burnt caramel and stewed prune, over ripe-almost rotten banana, and a touch of roasted coffee bean. Some bitter chocolate chimes in on the finish. This one gets better, as the taste buds acclimate to the burnt caramel/fruit profile. I'll come back to this one for sure-quite a pleasure."
"Seems very different than the draft version that I had at Redbones. I love both but the bottle is better. Now to try the 750ml."
" bottle."
"11.2oz. bottle poured into a tulip-style glass. It pours a very dark brown color, almost black, with 4 fingers of light tan head. The head retention is just incredible. Go ahead, take it out of the fridge ice cold and pour it. You'll have to wait a good 10-15 minutes for the head to die down enought to get the first taste. There is tons of lacing left as well. The smell is full of burnt malt, plums, and raisins. Very sweet smelling. The taste is also very sweet, with bits of sugar and malt on the tongue. There is a bit of fruit and spices present as well. The finish has just a hint of alcohol to it. Bits of plums and pepper, a little caramel. The mouthfeel is super thick and strong. The drinkability is fairly good for a 10.5% brew. A very good Belgian!"
"Deep, deep ruby hue with a huge tan head. Be careful when uncorking or opening the bottlecap, I've seen plenty of gushers with this beer. Beautiful lacing in the unique tulip-shaped Gulden Draak goblet. Another example of why a goblet is so big whereas the bottle seems so small. Now you know why... Succulent dark fruit aromas interplayed with some mustiness and a big alcohol nose; throw to smallest amount of cocoa butter in the nose and call it well-rounded. Sweet malt texture with some notes of prune and candied dates. Alcohol presence is not in question, it's most in-your-face. Very drinkable for it's ABV. Carbonation plays on the tongue balancing out the high gravity of the malt. I've enjoyed this beer for a long time, and a long time to come."
"Poured into my chalice an appeallingly warm dark ruby hue. The head, tan in color, was thin and short-lived, dissipating to film and collar quite quickly. I can't say the head disappointed, though, as beers this strong rarely muster a healthy head. Now the first sniff. Mmm. Sweet and fruity, but not overly so, with good malt and, dare I say it for a Belgian?, hops. Very, very smooth. Oh, and there's alcohol, too. First sip - smooth and slightly sweet, with a nice blend of sour cherries, molasses, caramel and barley. What really won me over, hophead that I am, was the finish. Along with a healthy alcohol punch, there's a good portion of hoppy bitterness here. It lurks in the opening, but comes out nicely in the finish, and sticks around to balance the aftertaste in a way that feels just right. Given the ABV, I'm not sure how many of these I could drink in one sitting, but I'd be happy to push that envelope. Yum!"
"Only problem is a slight syrupy mouthfeel."
"Drinkability - definitely not one to handle lightly. Refill with caution, this one will get you there in a hurry. If you're at home, fine, but I wouldn't have a 2nd one otherwise."
"It pours to a brown raisiny color with a thick tan head. The aroma is sweet, malty, and somewhat herbal. It has notes of dark fruits as well. The flavor is sweet and herbal, with a a spiciness and a brown sugar flavor. It is a full bodied, warming brew. A really enjoyable beer."
"I love this beer. It is one of the greats."
"Not sure why this is labelled ""dark tripel"" here...I've never seen it labelled that way in Belgium. At any rate...Appearence: Reddish brown, dark with highlights. Big rocky head. Clear. Aroma: Malty, sugary, noticeable caramel. Flavor: Sweet, malty caramel. No roastiness.Mouthfeel: Smooth, cream. Finish: Smooth, clean, with a lingering caramel."
"A birthday present from my housemates. Poured a faded mahogony with a dried buckskin colored head that frothed and bubbled. Smell was deep and rich with esters a plenty, fig, current and ahint of deep red fruits. Taste was hearty and full bodied without too much dominence by the alcohol. In fact the only indication was the warming throat sensation. The taste abounded with figs, mollassas, syrup more dried cherries, and scoops full of brown sugar. Mouthfeel was bubbley but remained full bodied and plentiful. Great autumn beer to warm to as the sun draws low and frost begins to creep like spiderwebs up the window panes."
"Tastes of big malt. Sweet and smooth. Apple flavors are evident. The ABV is listed at 10.5% but you would never know it from the taste. There is no alcohol bite. It is amazingly smooth. Finishes with a sweet/sour aftertaste. Big full bodied beer but subtle as well. It doesn't bludgeon you over the head with its strength but takes you down slowly and sweetly. A great brew to end an evening."
"WOW!!!Pours a deep ruddy brown color.Great aroma with hints of malt,chocolate,fruits.An extremely smooth taste-again notes of chocolate and fruits-figs and currants.A minimal hop bite-great overall malty flavor.Absolutely no hint of the 10.5% abv.A wonderfully smooth beer-full bodied.A great beer-goes down perfectly whether its your first or last of the day.THE BEST Belgian I have had in ages by far!!! I have wanted to try this one for ages and was not let down in the least bit.Wish I had another."
"The body is full, and flavor jumps all over you. Masses of fruits and malts with some nice spices. The complexity is not out of this world, but it sure kept me interested. Smooth and rich, it is a great treat to sit down with. The alcohol is almost invisible to the tongue which is very nice for 10.5%. Do not pass by this beer because it is definitely one of the best."
"Dark red brown color, small head. Aroma is fruity and sweet. Very malty and sweet. Slight hop bite. Smooth taste. Large body. Mouthfeel is full and round, slightly sweet. Finish is clean. Aftertaste is malty and slightly dry. Alcohol bite is prevalent, 10.5 %"
"It feels bold and crisp. A heavy touch to the mouthfeel. If you like sweet brews give this one a try."
"This beer pours a dark amber (mahogany) color. It first pours with no head, but quickly turns into a thick, white foamy head. The aroma is that of a very sweet malt - very nice. Possibly some fruits in there as well. The flavor is wonderfully odd - very refreshing. It has a sweetness to it with just a tiny bit of spiciness for the perfect blend. The high alcohol content is very well masked and almost non-detectable. The aftertaste is a little sweet malt that lingers on the tongue for a fully enjoyable experience."
"Poured an brown color with a thin head that stuck to the sides of the glass. A pleasant aroma that borders on flowery with some lingering yeasts. Strong malt flavor with a good balance of hops. The higher alcohol content did not overpower the flavor like some others do. Extremely drinkable as malt aftertastes linger nicely on the tongue. Once my glass was empty, I wanted more but I only had one bottle. I will definitely buy it again."
"Pours out a raisiny brown with a small tight head that lingers. Aroma is fruity with a faint touch of bread and molasses. Taste is divine, lots of fruity hints with that malty backbone. Well balanced with just a touch of bitterness throughout. Eminently drinkable, hides the alcohol content well behind that great taste. A remarkable concoction..."
"Huge dark head that disapear a little bit too quickly for my liking (this seems to be a problem withVan Steenberge). Really yeasty but not as thich as I was expecting from the description. The ABV level is too much apparent for my liking. Extra point for trying to be different: dark triple and cool bottle."
"Pours a slightly hazy brown with a burgundy cast and dark amber highlights when held to the light; and a full, rocky head of light tan foam completes the appearance. It holds exceptionally well and leaves solid sheets of lace, although they eventually reduce to just some spotty residue. Some chocolate and dark fruit (raisin, plum/prune, cherry, red wine) appear in the nose. The body is medium and nicely creamy due to its very fine, natural carbonation. The flavor is as the aroma indicates with a combination of rich cocoa and ripe dark fruits. It warms across the palate to reveal some softer caramel and alcohol; and a touch of background floral hops. It's very well-balanced by a solid, low-key bitterness. The finish is dry with some residual dark fruit; a wash of alcohol; some leafy hops; and a dull, lingering bitterness. Impressive!"
"Normally high abv Belgians like this aren't my favorites because they usually fall into two categories: syrupy sweet or heavy-handed with the alcohol. This golden dragon defies both camps. Murky reddish brown - the aroma is a caramel sweet invitation. 10.5 abv, but no fusel alcohols are present. The flavor is a hodge-podge to search through - rock candy, caramel malt, prune, apple - all in harmony. Despite the overall sweetness, it is not cloying and, while the finish can not be described as clean, it is surprisingly light. And where is the alcohol? Only a peppery bite on the tongue gives it away. Astoundingly smooth and drinkable."
"Gulden Draak -- now I know. Out of the white bottle comes a dark mahogany chestnut color with an enormous, incredibly durable and creamy khaki head. It laces well down the chalice. Very impressive looking. The bouquet is nutty and sweet, with notes of chocolate, mild alcohol, and, surprisingly, herbal hops. The taste of this beer is ever-evolving as the brew warms. I detected sweet, nutty malt, candy sugar, moderate alcohol, dark chocolate, allspice, nutmeg, cinnamon, a bit of pepper and twangy hops. The finish has somewhat of a warming alcohol and spicy, twangy hop character. The variety of flavors this beer possesses is incredible. The mouthfeel is velvety smooth with a very mild, subdued carbonation that fits perfectly. The potent alcoholic strength of this brew is hard to detect if you don't read the label first. This is an outstanding ale and is HIGHLY recommended!"
"Quite an enjoyable experience."
"The main reason I gave the appearance such a high rating was the massive, impressive head that it had. This head was sooo thick and sooo creamy, it is the best head I have ever experienced(jokes aside). The color was a very nice brownish-red, kind of like georgia mud water. The taste was beefy, just like most strong belgians. I really enjoyed this one, but it would have been even better in the dead of winter."
"That is why we drink it here!"
"Originally sampled on 5 May 2002. This pours a beautiful mahogany color w/ a frothy head. The flavors are complex w/ the usual Belgian suspects: dried fruit apples etc. It has a very nice sweet finish. I'm surprised to see that the alcohol level is 10.5%. I couldn't taste it. Very smooth, this is an elegant beer."
"What can I say about this beer? IMO, if the gods had a favorite drink, it would be Gulden Draak! This beer poured a beautiful, slightly hazy, deep reddish carmel color with a generous, thick, creamy white head. The aroma was a fantastic blend of alcohol, carmel, and spices. As I tipped the tulip to my lips, I could taste the sweet juice before it touched my mouth! The taste was an extreme blast of sweetness, a complex and wonderful blend of malts and a definite alcohol flavor that swirled my taste buds into a frenzy. I swallowed, and to my delight a wonderful hops bitterness came through, riding along side the flavors of coriander and sweet orange peal. My mouth was in heaven, and my pallet demanded more of the heavenly nectar, but my brain cells warned me of the effect that 10.5% alcohol would have on my ability to drive home. So much for driving home, I'm headed to the store to buy more Gulden Draak!!"
"A volcanic eruption of bubbles greeted me as I poured this one into it's, short term, new home. It is dark brown with some reddish/orange highlights and an airy tan foam, with lots of carbonation at first. After it settles down it has a big candy sugar aroma with raisins, syrup, and alcohol. Taste, at first, is obscured by the carbonation,this leads to an airy texture that improves if you give it time.The flavor is lightly fruity with powdered sugar, baking spices and a bit of plum, as the carbonation relaxes I can get tobacco and cedar in the finish with plenty of alcohol. The slightly lighter texture and womp of alcohol is a bit much for my 'buds to carry it to the higher scores. A great cigar beer I would imagine."
"To taste it is to have your mouth set aflame with darker fruits. One sip and you know that it'll hit you harder the more you drink. Very strong but sweet with a warming touch at the end. Sticky mouth feel and goes down fast, too fast if your not carefull! I would love to have this with a favorite cigar and a roaring fire. I'm looking forward to this again!"
"Perhaps I am just not a Belgian triple fan, but this beer...with its high alcohol content and overwhelming sweetness was a chore to drink."
"I love the bottle. A great way to keep light out. I would like to talk to someone who has aged one of these."
"Pour is a beautiful dark brown, with a large and long-lasting tan head which leaves great lacing. Aroma is of dark fruits, grape, raisin, plum, some cherry, mild hints of alcohol that become slightly more pronounced as it warms. Flavor is graps, cherry, raisin, and some of the alcohol in the end. Carbonation is fairly lively on the tongue, body is pretty full. Extremely tasty brew here."
"This superb brew pours a deep brownish-red akin to a dark, stained wood. A fabulous redolence -- complex and multi-faceted to say the least -- featuring red wine, grape soda, ripe fruits, and brown sugar. The gustatory sense delights as the flavors are primarily the same -- very sweet and delicious, ambrosial even. The mouthfeel is marked by a clear alcohol presence and a lively tango between the tongue and the natural carbonation. A gentle suggestion of dark plum skin graces the mouth as the sip is finished. From its handsome bottle through its delightful finish, this is simply excellent."
"Even before I opened the bottle I knew this would be a good beer. The white coating on the bottle is simple, yet makes it stad out from all the other beers on the shelf. It has a dark amber color with a huge tan head that is very well retained. One of the best visual beers I know of. Even if it doesn't taste good, the beauty of this beer is worth noting. But fortunately, it does taste wonderful. At 10.5 percent alcohol, gulden draak avoids tasting like whisky like some other high alcohol beers. The caramel-like sweetness hides the alchohol very well. The alcohol taste is apparent, but does not distract you from the malt character."
"This is a very interesting and exciting beer to drink. With every sip I enjoyed it a little more. I'd drink and everytime it would hint at a huge hop taste, but then quickly change to the sweet fruity flavors. A wonderful play with your taste buds. It was heavy yes, but easy to drink, like a chilled melted caramel. An exciting beer for a winter evening or if you're up for a nice beer to just slowly sip and enjoy."
"had this beauty at lucky baldwins in pasadena. good times. the appearance was a murky brown with a think, thick head, reminding me of a root beer float. the aroma is full of fruit, yeast, tiny hint of sweet malt and hop spice. the taste was floral and fruity. with sweet and almost sour at times mild grape flavor. it is a medium bodied beer with sweet fruity yeast aftertaste."
"Served with a moderate sized, dense tan head atop a red copper body, the beer displayed excellent head retention. The aroma was a well balanced malt and hops aroma which was appealing and begged me to take a drink. Upon taking the first sip, I was hit by a very sweet kaleidescope of flavors, all soaked in alcohol. Then a surprising roasted malt note crept in, with an ever so faint note of hop bitterness in the finish to help sweep away the chewy sweetness. The mouthfeel is excellent, very moist and supple feeling as it coats the tongue. The drinakbility is good considering the sweetness in the flavor and the ABV. This was a very pleasant experience that I hope to repeat sometime soon."
"I was lucky enough to find this on tap at Teller's in Hyde Park. Served in an authentic Gulden Draak tulip glass. Dark brown/amber pour with a nice frothy head. Spicy nutmeg aromas. Silky mouthfeel. Light malt profile. Lightly hopped. Very yeasty and bready. The taste of the high alcohol is muted by the spicy malty notes. Very nicely balanced. A good beer."
"Had a 11.2oz.er for the purpose of this review, and I felt it terribly the next day. How to rate the ease with which one drinks the Dragon, when the Dragon always slays you? ""Yes, I'll have another""...some other day...."
"Nice and foamy head with big bubbles that settles fast on the copper colored liquid. Leaves a little lace on top. Big and fruity smell that reminds me of raisins. The taste is very rich, sweet and fruity. However I think the taste is a bit too sticky sweetish and it reminds me alot of sherry. :l"
"The drinkability was good. Fruity and hoppy."
"The fourth beer of my Valentine's sampler. Nice dark amber color, and a good head to boot. The first sip stiffened me in my chair. I could taste the ABV, but for some reason, it didn't have that ""liquir"" taste that turns me off. The fruits and the hops were there, but the ABV presense never left."
"One of the more drinkable strong beers I have had. A truly excellent beer."
"Thai dessert plate nose of mango, lime and rice pudding emanates from this deep rosewood brew. Begins semi-sweet fermented fruit to meet up with a few hop vines growing in an alcohol desert oasis. Maybe a wisp of chocolate in there too, but more like a memory than concrete. Kahlua & Tonic? Nah, it's better than that. Bubbly and tasty!"
"This is a Bentley of beers: big, powerful, expensive, rare, and intoxicating. Everything a Belgian triple should aspire to. Enjoy."
"This beer pours a very dark brown with more than ample white head. The aroma is sweet. The smell of fruit is dominant. Raisin is the first smell, but this smells like a very complex beer. The taste is very smooth and sweet. There are not a lot of hops in the flavor; it is really malty. There is a definite warming as this beer goes down. Medium bodied. This is a beer that I will try again and again until I completely figure it out."
"This beer poured a very dark cloudy amber color and formed an off white foamy head that left circular lace when it subsided. An aroma of malt and spice. A flavor of malt, caramel and spice. It has a medium light body and a sweet, slightly sour finish."
"Dark brownish amber in color (not an especially appealling hue) with an incredibly fluffy head. Very honey-like smell with a honey-like sweetness and a bit of peppery spice towards the end. Somewhat smooth-drinking, however the high alcohol content, and overpowering sweetness cause this beer to lose points in the drinkability category. Definitely an after-dinner beer."
""
"This potent brew pours a hazy deep brown with a blush of orange around the edges. The head is a creamy, dense, quiet crown that lasts to the last sip. While the nose screams alcohol the taste is velvet malt. Intense in it's fruitiness with toffee and caramel notes this Belgian barleywine also exhibits a subtle, rounded hoppiness to add to it's profile. The mouthfeel is an exquisite, smooth, thick wonder. I can imagine medieval monk's drinking this brew for dinner with a smile on their face. I had one on my face for sure. Definitely an after dinner or dessert beer, it would be hard to down many of these with it's alcohol content."
"On the pour a murky plum color with a prodigious beige head and tons of lace to conceal the glass. Nose is malt, earthy, sweet, also a bit like an over ripe apple. Starts malt, top is light, potently acidic, scantily hopped, long lasting somewhat sour aftertaste. Alcohol also makes itself known as there is a bitterness I attribute to the high ABV. Not bad, different for sure, will have to sample a few to make a true determination about its suitability."
"This is dangerously drinkable for such a potent bere.  Full bodied and smooth, with just the gentlest of warming sensations from the alcohol."
"Deafening rim shot like pop upon release of the cork. Initial gushing diminishes to allow pouring. Deep crimson in hue, w/ a light haze. The dense, thick, sticky dark tan large bubbled head leaves rough lace. Light bubblegum esters are perceived at first in aroma, then are ceded by a pleasantly tart, unripe citrus fruit. Mellow sweetness then follows and is of a dark, molasses and/or dried date like nature. When the brew warms and breathes, dry, powdery chocolate and raisin - like Special B add richness and round the aroma out. Phenol and higher alcohol are present only at a trace. Very enticing and refined aromawise. Caramelized sweetness from both dark caramel malt and dark candi sugar is perceived at first in flavor, then yields to a yeast derived melange of light clove phenol and esters that mirror the aroma, albeit with banana esters more pronounced. Chocolate malt, although somewhat overshadowed by sweetness and yeast byproducts, contributes a subdued, yet rich undertone that bolsters the malt profile and adds to the complexity of this brew. Full bodied, and once the initially high carbonation dissipates, the mouthfeel is rendered agreeably smooth. Hop bitterness is virtually absent, and although malt sweetness is strong, it never becomes cloying. The lack of alcohol flavors and smooth malt profile renders this brew dangerously drinkable. Finishes w/ a hint of biscuit malt giving way to clean caramel sweetness. Gulden Draak is softly sweet, complex and deceivingly light on the palate. Akin to a tripel in overall character w/ mellow chocolate undertones. Delicious! Superb drinkability due to the nearly complete lack of alcohol heaty harshness. Somewhat smoother in the 750 ml bottle versus the 11.2 ounce."
"A huge long-lasting coffee and cream-colored head is what you'll get when pouring, settling over opaque reddish-amber beer...a visually stunning combination. Some notes of dark fruits greet the nose along with some estery yeastiness. Tasting shows fruitiness, alcoholic warmth..sweet first, then drying out due to the hoppiness. A great mix of many taste sensations...truly a remarkable beer! Finishes with some more dark fruitiness & alcohol. This is a real heavyweight of a beer...even by Belgian standards! 2 bottles worth of flavor seem to be packed into 1, very cool white Duvel-style bottle too."
"Smells like an old tyme candy factory with strands of taffey, fudge, vanilla and subtle spices (cinnamon). Notes of chocolate ice cream, date syrup, pepper and alcohol. A creamy, frothy mousse establishes a rich, chewy, melt-in-your-mouth texture. A fantastic beer. From the realm of Baron von Munchhausen. The only possible fault is the aggressive, unmitigated alcohol flavor which keeps the drinkablility score down."
"This beer doesn't pussy-foot around. It's serious, complex, mysterious (alcohol-wise), demands respect and if you're not careful it'll walk up to you and kick your freagin' ass! One of my favourites, and simply a classic amongst Belgian beers."

"This is the best dark ale I've drank so far from Belgium. Nice tight with foam on the glass. Complex aroma mixed with a pleasant spicy taste. Not a big bitter after taste on the palate!"
"This beer is an experience in itself.  It's a beautiful dark brown beer with a full, thick and creamy head.   Heavily carbonated: If you hold it to the light, you'll see a constant billowing of bubbles from the scorings on the bottom of a belgain beer glass.  Spicy, complex aroma.  Pleasing warming sensation from the first sip.  Full, creamy, and very malty beer.  I loved it."
"Tried this one on tap last night, and it was everything I remembered and more... beautiful cloudy dark amber, with a creamy head.  Yeasty, sweet, and spicy... notes of dried fruit and maybe even cinnamon.  I've been looking long and hard for a beer that I like more that this, but as of now, Draak rules."
"Right at the top of my list of favorites"
"Gulden Draak:  White stubby Belgian bottle.  I have never seen a pour like this one:  the entire glass is filled with foam, and the beer had to work its way down through the foam, like water through sand.  Reddish, clear in appearance; needless to say, huge dense head, tan, very long lasting (five minutes after the pour, I still have not tasted it).  Thick, rich molasses syrup, very sweet.   Long lasting sweet aftertaste.  Very nice, once a week."
"0.33L white painted bottle. Rich, hazy bronze color. Tight tan lasting head. Prickly carbonation. Unique flavor...has the traits of a trippel, but with the malts kicked up making this a toasty and rich trppel. Some oak and yeasty notes impart their own characteristics. Pleasant alcohol warming. Quite nice."
"Big bubbled head, settles at 1/4 of an inch for a while. Murky brown color. Complex smells, malts and slight citrusy aromas. Noticeable carbonation in mouthfeel but ""beer-like"" presence of dense raisins and an acidic wine quality with more than usual hoppiness. Alcoholic...but clears from the palate pretty quickly. Best when inhaling the aromas while tasting. I'm not a monstrous fan of some of the more acidic Belgians, but this was nice. Cool ""milk"" short and stepped glass bottle."
"I had the little white bottle, pours dark copper brown, with a big foamy head.Cloudy appearance. Darker than most wheats beers I have had.  Heavy yeast smell. Tasted very sweet and delicious, like alot of the beligium wheats. Alot of fruit and spices that match up well with my grilled chicken dinner. Nice warm finish with 10.5 % ABV. Very drinkable though. I would buy this again and keep for nice dinners."
"Sticky, syruppy, sweet,malty and just a bit over the top. I like beers with a big complexity, but this is perhaps a bit too much. But its not bad, could have been better."
"The golden dragon does live up to its rep.  Beautiful bright copper/red.  Good nose you can tell its going to be rich.Pour slowly cause this beer gives you a nice head no matter how you pour it.Rich and malty taste,slight toffee and sweetness.Nice balance,great for dessert."
"Just an excellent beer, too bad its $3.99 for 330ml, thick long lasting head.  Reddish color.  Easy to find white bottle at the largest liquor stores.  Also available 750ml - $10.39."
"An excellent beer.  I tried a single bottle one weekend and was hooked!  Unfortunately supplies in Indy are a bit limited.  This brew is best when slightly chilled on cold evenings."
"Definitely an exceptional beer.  Hard to find here in the states, but a treat when you get a bottle.  It's a classic example of Belgium's best.  This one will lay you down if you're not careful!!"
