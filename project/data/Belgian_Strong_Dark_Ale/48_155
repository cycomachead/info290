4.75,12,4.75,4.75,4.75,4.75,4.75,"Poured two fingers light brown sudsy head, excellent retention and sticky lacing. Dark orange and brown, with some amber shining through. Quite clear, minimal clouding. Smells of raisins, brown sugar and sweet malt. Notes of other dark fruits like plum and cherries. Aromatics have a lot to say, and loudly. Upon tasting, higher alcohol content is apparent, but well disguised behind a menagerie of bold flavors, matching aromatics. Brown sugar is apparent up front, followed by a lingering aftertaste of the dark fruits. Wonderful mouth feel, chewy, syrupy, foams up on the tongue, but not overwhelming in terms of acidity or carbonation. An incredible balance. Flavor lingers on front of tongue for several minutes. What an amazing beer. I picked up a 750 for $13, not the best price I've found it at, but well worth it for such a spectacular treat. Very highly recommended. Even my burps are delectable.","sporklift87","Mar 18, 2015"

The beer pours a surprisingly dark, turbid shade of molasses. The aroma is somewhere between caramel and dulce de leche with some earthy notes, maybe raisins and cloves. It has the familiar sweet lace of all tripels with some well-balanced savory malts. The combination produces a boozey mouthfeel like a fortified wine or grappa. It's a strong, unique beer.","mdexter","Mar 15, 2015"

4.63,9.2,4.75,4.75,4.5,4.5,4.75,"I absolutely love everything about the look of this beer. From the iconic white bottle, ominous red letters and legendary dragon ship, it promises to be a bad ass experience. Very medeval. The appearance of the beer itself is equally impressive. Like rich, raw maple syrup in color. It poured in to a small snifter with a towering head of loose foam. The beige 3 finger crown resembled swiss cheese, with its loose, large bubbles of varying size and consistency. The beautiful and unique cap settled gradually, leaving soapy residual lacing on the glass. The nose on this beer is incredibly complex. As the beer reached room temperature more and more layers of aroma continued to present themselves. Toffee, burnt caramel, banana esters and slight booze come together in such a wonderful way as to conjure thoughts of bananas foster. Slight mineral notes and clover honey add even more depth to the bouquet. The taste is brimming with candy sugar sweetness and a little fusel alcohol heat. Sweet candied fruits, dried banana chips and a honey crisp character yield to a tart, tangy finish of mild puckering green apple. A peppery spice from the alcohol compliments the assortment of flavors. The finish imparts a slight suggestion of pumpernickel & caraway seed. Extremely complex. As I sample each sip, I believe I could continue to pull additional flavors and aromas out of the experience. Remarkable. The mouthfeel has a lively, creamy texture. Rich and inviting. You just gotta love the big authentic Belgians. They're just so full of character and complexity. A+","JohnnyI","Jan 19, 2015"

Rich-flavoured is almost an understatement, as the dark fruit and sugary, boozy flavours make this feel like a dessert in and of itself. Easily one of the better examples of this style that I have tried - worth seeking out, worth the price, and any Belgian dark ale fan worth his or her salt should consider this one a must-try.","thehyperduck","Nov 27, 2014"

I gave them a the full calculated range between 3.75 and 4, but I think they all fall into a certain flavor profile that is common to the brewer (which itself is not uncommon).

Not much lacing, but that's not surprising considering the alcohol in this beer. The aroma was fantastic, with raisins, toffee and dark fruit notes. The taste is phenomenal, with lots of dark fruit flavors and some malty sweetness and a bit of grape must flavor- simply outstanding! The mouthfeel is creamy and silky smooth, with just a bit of alcohol burn. This is just a great beer!","timontheroad","Oct 26, 2014"

3.25,-23.3,3.25,3.25,3.25,3.25,3.25,"Overall I thought this was a decent beer and I thought it was a pretty average example Belgian Strong Dark Ale, the brewery claims this in a dark Tripel, but to me it's just an average Belgian Strong Dark Ale and there isn't anything about it that immediately makes me think of a Tripel. This beer didn't have the best drinkability, it was a little smooth, slightly cloying, a little sticky, fairly crisp, a little filling and the taste didn't do the best job at holding my attention, so I think one bottle would be my limit and even that is a little more than enough, I wouldn't want to have another one in a row. What I like the most about this beer was nothing, there wasn't one single aspect that stuck at as being better than the rest. What I liked the least about this beer was the sweetness and lack of complexity, that seemed to be this beers biggest downfalls. I might buy this beer again if I knew it was fresh, but I'm in no hurry to find a fresh bottle and as it stands now I can't say I would recommend it. All in all I just wasn't too into this beer it seemed a little bland and with the sweetness sticking out the most it didn't really make for the best introduction to a dark Tripel. This isn't my favorite beer from this brewery or my favorite BSDA. Better luck next time guys, this one just wasn't for me.","StoutHunter","Jun 24, 2014"

Smells of licorice, cherries, and loads of malts. The taste basically follows along, but has amazing complexity with the added alcohol esters. Almost perfect mouthfeel, quite dry, with smooth, bubbly carbonation that just won't give up. This really is a top-notch beer.","Intrinsic","Jun 10, 2014"

This was one of the greats for me when I first started drinking better beer, and revisiting it with age on it was a pleasure indeed. I don't usually drink Belgian beers of this kind anymore, but it works joyfully as a dessert offering even at this point. This is also one of the most recommended offerings to present to people that have a skewed viewpoint on beer. For a monster beer, very drinkable and definitely enjoyable.","magictacosinus","Apr 21, 2014"

Some herbal spices and pepperiness with some sweet fruit to balance it out. Raisins and bubblegum. Very nice mouthfeel, thickness from the malt. Sweeter and fruitier in the beginning, the warming alcohol and a little bit of hops then break through and the aftertaste is toasty and malty with a little bit of dried fruits. Bready from the malt. Honestly, hard to describe as every with every sip I seem to find new characteristics. A great brew and good treat, ABV definitely noticeable.","cambabeer","Feb 22, 2014"

3.96,-6.6,3.75,4,4,3.75,4,"A Belgian classic, though sweeter than I remember it. Perhaps the age of the bottle has resulted in a touch too much oxidation? Looks decent, with a superbly rich aroma and flavour of dried fruit and booze. Body is OK, though the carbonation could be toned down a tad. An excellent beer, particularly for winter, but one to be savoured at leisure. Add this one to your must-try list.","jazzyjeff13","Dec 21, 2013"

It has that high carbonation and big bright fruity crispness of a tripel but with lots of brown sugar and dark bread flavors. It's like a cross between a tripel and a quad. Very unique and very tasty.","Dope","Dec 14, 2013"

4.47,5.4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Poured a deep ruby red, semi-opaque, with a one finger off-white head that receded to a white ring rather quickly. While the head was nothing to write home about, the body color was fantastic. Scents of bubblegum, apple, pear, banana, fruity esters of a less describable sort, Belgian yeast, candi sugar and faint hints of alcohol. A good, fruity, yeasty, sweet and complex Belgian aroma. Taste begins with candi sugar, notes of apple and pear and some yeasty dark bread, moves into raisin, prune, sweet bready malts, caramel and some earthy Belgian yeast. Finishes with more bready malt and just a touch of alcohol. Quite nice, rather sweet, but not overly so and very complex. Mouthfeel is medium-heavy bodied, with moderate carbonation, a slight alcohol burn, and a drying finish. Very nice sipping mouthfeel. Overall this is an excellent Belgian Strong Dark. Its got the complexity in both aroma and flavor that defines the style, and a very nice profile to both to boot.","Auraan","Nov 25, 2013"

Unlike bottled reviews, I did not get an expected alcohol nose but rather a sweet malty aroma. In drinking, I found a very well balanced experience and a warming feeling (obviously from the gravity). Overall, one of the top ten brews I've tasted this year.","DRStaples","Nov 09, 2013"
4.53,6.8,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Overall - This is a beer that gets straight to the point does not beat around the bush and try to trick you into what it is: a serious and delicious Belgian Strong Dark Ale that is extremely well crafted and will put you on your ass if you don't respect it. Definitely a sipper. Personally one of my two favorites from the style with the Rochefort 8 yet how they achieve their excellence couldn't be more different. A huge recommendation for anyone wanting to try something in the style.","DenisKolkin","Nov 09, 2013"

Most beers like this feel strong but this one was an exception and felt more like a Dubbel than a Strong Dark Ale. This may be the best Belgian beer I've ever had and given how many other strong candidates are out there, that's no small feat. A must-try for any aficionado of beer, regardless of stylistic preference.","JerzDevl2000","Aug 02, 2013"

The bright, snappy hoppiness is there, as well as the fruit forward yeast and solid bready malt backbone. Unfortunately, there is also a lot of alcohol phenols in both flavor and aroma that really interferes and covers up the above said qualities as the beer warms in it's glass. This is a decent beginner Belgian beer, but it can't hold its own against the big boys of Belgium.","flayedandskinned","Jul 23, 2013"

Pours lightly cloudy deep ruby red color with a 2 finger dense and fluffy cream colored head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Nice foamy lacing clings on the glass, with a lot of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of big pear, apple, grape, raisin, plum, banana, clove, pepper, dark candi sugar, honey, herbal, toast, brown bread, and yeast earthiness. Fantastic aromas with great balance and big complexity of fruity/spicy esters with moderate malt sweetness; and good strength. Taste of pear, apple, grape, raisin, plum, banana, clove, pepper, herbal, dark candi sugar, honey, toast, brown bread, and yeast earthiness. Lingering notes of light and dark fruits, banana, clove, pepper, dark candi sugar, honey, herbal, toast, brown bread,and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Awesome balance and complexity of fruity/spicy yeast ester flavors; with a moderate dark malt balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a slick, crisp, and moderately prickly mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a fantastic Belgian strong dark ale! Big complexity of fruity/spicy esters with moderate malt balance; and very smooth and crisp to sip on. A highly enjoyable offering.","superspak","Jul 16, 2013"

The difference in balance is like night and day. The sweetness is tempered a great deal, thereby making this much more drinkable.

Complexly flavored, full-bodied, smooth brew, and kind of dangerous because it doesn't drink like a strong ale.

The smell of this beer is almost that of a tripel, with clove and banana flavors. On the other hand, it also produces a dark fruit smell, of plums and licorice. Alright, I'm pretty intrigued, so let's get into the taste. Holy damn. I am not disappointed, as a rush of plum, fig, raspberry and clove come to destroy my palette. The lacing on this beer is extraordinary, as it goes down all the way throughout the glass. Mouthfeel is pretty good, with high carbonation, not as much as Duvel, but still pretty high for a BSDA. Overalll, this is one of the best dark ales that I've had, and am looking forward to trying this again in the future.","Cuttooth","Mar 09, 2013"

Deep rich dark fruits mixed with a hint of alcohol round out the flavor quite nicely. Medium to thick body with a moderate to high level of carbonation and a sweet bubbly mouthfeel.

It's sweet, vinous and yeasty. A very intense smell. The taste is very complex with licorice, spices, malts and yeast. The mouthfeel is very full and rich. A very long medium bitter finish. This is one of my all time favorites.","Marc_V","Nov 28, 2012"

I believe it is more like bittersweet prunes prepared with the smokey essence from french pine bark. This also correlates to the hint of bakers chocolate. However, that is a false tasting note which can fool the novice. You see, as the french pine bark tree is expertly roasted, it will certainly lend itself to the essence of bitter chocolate. It is this essence which has been expertly infused within this fine beer. Bottom line is... I kind of like it. Im gonna buy it again when i have a hankering for some sweet light wood.","Brian2001","Nov 03, 2012"

Served in a Unibroue tulip, the beer pours a murky reddish/mahogany brown color with about an inch light tan head that stayed around a little while. There's also a good amount of lacing. Aroma is very nice, it smells like dark fruit, caramel, yeast, spice and some candied fruit. Taste pretty much is the same as the aroma, but there's also some candy sugar and bready malt noticeable. It's a very sweet and malty brew. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's smooth and creamy with moderate carbonation. I think this is a pretty good beer.

I can also pick up the dark candi sugar, Belgian yeast, and bready malt. I can also pick up that dark fruit aroma that is common with this style. There are good flavors here. I can pick up the bready malt, sweetness from the dark candi sugar, and the fruity flavors from the yeast. I can also pick up the alcohol here. The body is full with moderate carbonation.

A nice banana strain comes through on the nose, plums and rasains follow, finishes with a toffee meets alcohol touch. Carbonation right on the tongue opens the mouth up for more banana, some citrus, dark fruits and slight lingering vanilla. Biscuity malts fill up the mouth and give a metallic sorta flavor, slight detection of alcohol heat and finishes with a nice cheery wood flavor. Full bodied beer, moderate carbonation, leaves the pallete dry and wanting more. Great beer, dont know where ""dark tripple"" comes from this beer drinks like a BSA like any other, very complex, fruity, and extremely delicious. Cheers.","gabedivision","Jul 13, 2012"

With that said, I didn't know what to think at first with the distinct white label and wasn't prepared for the full body taste. The after taste is a tad bitter but not overwhelming. This is a sipping beer like a good scotch. Tiny sips at a time not a drink it down quickly style of beer. One to be enjoyed slowly to enjoy the smooth texture. Cheers!","rmueller","Jun 25, 2012"

4.62,9,4,4.5,5,4,4.5,"Poured into a snifter, this living beer poured a reddish tinted dark brown and emitted a generous head. Apparently, the yeast was tired of being bottled up, and wanted out desperately. When the bubbles mellowed, the aroma was mildly sweet. Hints of banana and dry malt were present. The initial taste was sweet and smooth. Certainly, this is an easy drinker. A sweet banana flavor made an appearance with a mild spiciness. The flavor in this one is pretty close to perfect, it does not overwhelm and is not too mild. In the aftertaste, the tart fruit of a triple such as prune and over-ripe are present. The warming sensation of the alcohol does not burn like a a hard liquor, but is quite gentle. The aftertaste almost has the flavor of a good sherry. Like sherry, the first few sips are the best. If you drink to much, you risk failing to appreciate the complexity of the drink. This is one by favorites, and it is very accessable.","JohnnyHopps","May 05, 2012"

Head retention is outstanding, it positively creeps down towards the body of the beer. Lacing isn't quite up there with the best Belgians though, it's fairly spotty. The nose is wonderful, heavy on figs and raisins and brown sugar, with just a little bit of alcohol creeping in in the background. The flavor profile can't quite follow through on all that though, as it's very heavy on plums, and the booziness (while still not harsh) is a bit more prevalent here. The brown sugar is faded significantly, an the dark fruit aspect of the beer doesn't have the same depth, it's much more one note here. The body is sufficiently light for a high ABV Belgian beer, but the carbonation just doesn't quite have the activity/effervescence that some of the best do. This is my first time trying Gulden Draak in a couple years, and I'm enjoying it a bit more now than I remember. It's a well above average Belgian Strong Dark Ale.","axeman9182","Apr 12, 2012"

That being said, I was sadly disappointed. Maybe its just not my cup of tea. But it had no carbonation in the mouth, and was just like taking a bite out of fudge with nothing to wash it down. Just too much sweetness, mixed with the thickness of this beer was hard for me to get around. The biggest disappointment I had was the smell, So complex and inviting, makes your mouth water just thinking about it. Then the taste just doesn't do it justice. Overall I wouldn't buy one again.","Vegita182","Mar 01, 2012"

The pour yields a tan head about 2 fingers tall, carbonation can be seen rising in the beer. Retention isn't spectacular, but that is to be expected when this registers at 10.5 ABV. It recedes to a ring and an island of foam in the center of my glass. The smell is of rich sweet barley malt, some caramel, apple, Belgian yeast. In the taste I get a hint of apples up front as well as an acute candy sweetness. Towards the middle I notice more dark fruit, sweet heavy malts. I also detect some alcohol in the taste. Mouthfeel is on the thicker side, but some assertive carbonation livens it up. This is a really interesting beer, I like the idea of a dark triple, and this one is put together really well.","gkunkle","Feb 18, 2012"

The nose was very fruity with plum, strawberry, pineapple. Finished out with a mild yeast aroma. Good heft to the feel, stands under the weight of the alcohol quite well. Fruit flavors carry over where the aroma started things off. Plum, raisin, sweet pale fruitiness. The yeast character is not as pronounced as other BSDAs I've encountered. This is not a bad thing.

I couldn't even fathom that this brew was 10.5%. Despite that I could session this beer, well maybe for about 90 minutes. It goes down with a slight oft-plum taste with crazy belgian yeasts and smooth, crispy effervescent flavors. I could not find a morsel wrong with this one.

Flavors are toffee sweet malt with a ton of old world fruit charcteristics, including dates, currants, and some raisin. The aftertaste is rich and tangy sweet, with a touch of toffee and hops, and a little bit of warmth at the end of the palate. The finish is slick, and almost creamy. Delicious beer!

Aroma is robust and concerted. Tastes of more dark fruits and has a definite vinous feel. Behind that are some sweet caramel notes, more rum booziness and a hint of butterscotch. Slightly syrupy with a creamy core and dry edges. Medium to heavy mouth-feel. Alcohol is noticeable. Brand new Belgian for me, and one of the best I've had in a while.","stephens101","Dec 03, 2011"

The fruitiness in there, with some nice, slightly burnt caramel. There is some bitterness in the finish, and the fruity esters linger. Dark malty flavor lingers in the aftertaste.

Vanilla, oak, apricot, plum and some port-like flavors mingle with champagne sweetness, with just enough hops to balance everything out and keep the brain from leaping out of the skull in sheer joy.

4.89,15.3,4,5,5,4.5,5,"O - Gulden Draak is one of my all-time favorites, and this review reflects that. It retains all of the gloriousness of a quality Belgian brewed tripel, but the darkness of it adds a dimension that not many tripels can match. Its fruit profile is darker than most tripels (dark fruits, fewer of the lighter fruits you sometimes get in lighter tripels), almost making it Quad like.

The lacing isn't strong but it's got just a little bit going on from time to time. The smell of the beer had an earthy spiced aroma to it mixed with some bright fruity notes and a touch of booze. The taste of the beer had a subtle sweetness to it upfront and had a slight bite to it in the aftertaste from the settling spices. There's a little bit of bread in the taste too. The mouthfeel is well carbonated and almost medium bodied. Overall this beer is good on mostly every level and really worth trying if you haven't already.","Knapp85","Jul 01, 2011"

A twinge of the plum smell but mostly the sweet sugar with a bit of an earthy tone. Taste is a nice spicy sugar mix. Dried plums with a twist of a slight hop bitterness follows it up. The sugar, fruit, bitterness and earthy notes all come together nicely in the middle even though they are distinct in the front and the back. Does have a slight burn in the throat but I noticed most Belgian Strong Dark Ales do. Actually this is the first Belgian I have had in a long time. At least a year.

You get a nice sweet, sour, malt, fruit and alcohol taste all combined in a nice package. Nicely balanced. This beer definitely opens up nicely the warmer it gets. I'm thinking almost room temperature is ideal for Gulden Draak. Mouthfeel is nice, velvety- w/ the sweet, sour, and alcohol all in play. Smooths out quite a bit the warmer it gets. Drinkability is great. This beer is a sipper at 10.5% ABV, but it goes down a little too easy, and the alcohol will catch up to you quickly.

There are more flavors in there, but the more you taste the more buzz you get and flavors become muted.

The taste follows pretty closely, with a blend of dark fruits interbreeding with caramel, toffee, rye bread, and a nice spice blend that I assume would make a good banana bread even better. Good times. The body is a hefty medium, with a moderate carbonation and feel that borders on the chewy, but never quite makes it (and that's not necessarily a bad thing here).

The first scent is fruity (dates, plums, and bananas) which are quickly joined by alcohol finishing with spice. For me the scents seemed to be in stages. The taste was much of the same other than a slightly different order. Dark fruits and spice on the front coming in front of a wet bready malt. The alcohol finishes things off and lingers for a bit. Pretty dry finish. Sweet, but not overdone by any means. This is a pretty solid ale and one of my favorite styles.","alkemy","Apr 16, 2010"

Nose is heavy with the molasses sweetness of the malts as well as a macerated fruit smell, chiefly of plums, dates, apples, banana, etc. Full bodied in the mouth, as advertised, the carbonation is just right to allow all the fruit notes to pop on the tongue and really develop. As expected with this style, the banana and spice dominate, and the alcohol is very very sneaky. At 10.5% this could be a very good or very bad thing, depending on what you are looking for!

4.2,-0.9,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,4,"Stubby 330ml brown bottle that is powder coated with a white (paint?) in a clever way to both prevent the light from intruding and make the bottle immediately recognizable. Pours a clear amber color with more than 2 fingers of somewhat yellowish/tan stained head. Significant amount of lace clings to the glassware and the head retains fairly well. Continuous bubbles rise to the surface in support of the head. Nose is fruity sweet and quite pleasant with the malt character being a mix of something like caramelized raisins and a bit of nuttiness with alcohol coming through from the back and a faint touch of hops make themselves known in a partially grassy way. Taste has a big alcohol presence that is somewhat solvent and quite warming. Upfront the flavors of malty sweetness meet the bittering hops and are eventually overtaken by the big alcohol character. Alcohol reigns supreme throughout the tasting experience with notes of caramelized malt sweetness and slight bitter hops in the finish. There is a lingering taste left in the mouth that is a mix between the lingering alcohol, caramelized malt sweetness and hop bitterness all fighting for the attention/last impression left in your mouth. Feel of this big beer is medium with a moderate amount of carbonation that fits the bill perfectly. Clearly a sipper, it is strangely drinkable for how much alcohol presence is displayed.","stakem","Apr 07, 2010"

3.8,-10.4,4,4,3.5,4,4,"Poured a 11.2oz stubby into my Bell's tulip. This beer pours a dark, prunish brown with a massive, three inch, beige cap that leaves sticky lacing all the way down the sides of the glass. The aroma reminds me first of dark fruits. Hints of ripe, red apple, sour cherries, plum and just a bit of prune. Carmel and toffee come out in the middle of the nose with just a hint of Belgian candy sugar at the finish of the aroma. The flavor is rather vinous to me. Grape jelly, apple and just a bit of prune come through. To me, it reminds me of a sweet wine, where the grapes flavor is very concentrated, like an ice wine. Big sweet malt notes dominate the middle of the flavor profile and it finishes with just a hint of booze mixed with brown sugar. They really do a wonderful job at covering the 10.5% alcohol. As it warms, sour cherry notes really start to dominate. The mouthfeel is light for as dark as the beer is. I understand, it's a stereotype that darker beers are normally heavier in body, but this one really surprised me. The carbonation is crisp and fits really nicely with the body. All in all, this is a really good beer. I'm sure it won't be the last time I drink it.","hwwty4","Dec 27, 2009"

I get a warm boozey alcohol burn at first, then a ton of different flavors come out. Sweet and tart cherries, black pepper, spicy, earthy, oak notes. Green tea with lemon grass. There is some understated hop bitterness. Lots going on. It's 10.5 abv, but it drinks more like a good 80 proof bourbon. This is for sipping.

I could feel the alcohol on the back of my throat. It seemed almost too sweet. The mouthfeel was pretty syrupy with a touch of carbonation. The sweetness cuts into the drink ability of this beer, not to mention its high alcohol content. However, if I wasn't driving I could have had at least one more of these before trying something else.

Accents of cherries, bread, bleu cheese, and brown sugar. A magnificent beer, and a meal in itself. Thicker than a normal triple. Would probably very nicely compliment a piece of fresh bread and a nice salty piece of gorgonzola or stilton.","jballeng","Jun 11, 2009"

4.23,-0.2,4.5,4,4.5,4,4,"BB June 7/09. One finger tan head on the pour, sits atop a dark rust coloured brew. The head gently subsided to a cloudy, splotchy consistency with moderate carbonation and lacing. Smell is sour fruit, black cherry, pumpernickel loaf. Sour and sweet notes alternate with dark fruit, prune tort, bitter sour aftertaste. Mouthfeel is lively with a bit of tartness and malt backbone that comes through in the finish but is overshadowed by the sweet and sour mix. When cold, the alcohol is hardly noticeable but with air and warming there is a cherry brandy quality with enhanced sweetness although the sour kick also sticks around. This is not only very tasty but also very interesting for anyone with an interest in beer.","ThatWineGuy","May 26, 2009"

This was where it becomes difficult because I hate the taste of raisins and that taste is VERY strong in this beer. I could swear apricots are in this one as well.

Notes of walnut and honey dominate with nice raw malty undertones and cake sweetness. Mouthfeel is surprisingly hot and sharp with a medium body that has a lightly juicy character. Flavor is very well matched to aroma, but the sweetness comes through a bit more than the nutty flavors. Molasses, dark fruits - raisin, prune, tempered by a touch of apple skin and flour.

Anyway, it poured a lovely copper color with a thin but creamy head into my Chimay goblet. Carbonation was active. The large and unusual white bottle makes me feel like I'm drinking from a milk bottle. The nose was cheery with fruitiness and hints of cherries and cherry licorice. Honestly, not flavors I normally seek out, but somehow this really works. The taste reflects the aroma; fruity with cherries and strawberrries. Very bouncy with candied sugar making for a smooth, sweet but balanced and pleasant experience. Incredibly smooth and drinkable...I'm very suprised, since I don't expect any of these qualities from your average triple. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy. The lovely fruitiness bathes the palatte. This is a highly drinkable triple. I never expected such sweetnes and smoothness from a triple, but wow ! This is a must have.

Big fluffly white head that dissipated to a nice glass coating lace. BIG hints of dark fruit here particularly raisins and dates soaked in a bit of alcohol. Underneath that I found a faint, buttery malt sweetness aroma. This beer smells really big! To my surprise, it did not taste very big...meaning that it hid its palatable alcohol pretty well. On top of the raisiny flavor I also got a nice refreshing apple taste. Also present is a subtle caramel malt backbone with little bits of butterscotch here and there. This is super tastey. Normally I'd think carbonation would be weird in a beer like this, but the bubbles are very smooth and enhance the creamy mouthfeel which leaves behind a pleasant sweetness that is not sticky. And finally, this beer will kick you to the curb if you're not careful...it hides the booze extremely well.","BeerHonky","Feb 19, 2007"

Bubbling carbonation is seen rising from the bottom up. First sip was extremely over-powering and hits you hard. 10.50 ABV is not hidden. Very thick bodied.. Doesnt really leave a long lingering bitterness, but has a dry finish. Great carbonation.. There is so much going on in the taste its hard to rate and describe. Sweet malts with hints of molasses and raisins.No hop flavor I could detect. Aroma is all malt and alcohol. The mouthfeel is very harsh and doesn't go down smooth.

Taste was also big on the candy-like fruit, and also a bit of spicy herb as well. Mouthfeel was medium bodied, and high on the drinkability factor. The alcohol is really well hidden on this beer.

The nose is potent, though less of alcohol than sweet grains and dark, fruity notes. The taste is sweeter than I had expected, and the alcohol was not quite in balance, though also not unduly assertive. A bit of chocolate/red wine and hops makes things interesting. The mouthfeel is nice--substantial but not clingy. Our server pushed this as ""what some have called the best beer in the world.""

This brew would benefit from less carbonation as I think it takes away from the taste. It has tight carbonation, champagne like, finishes smooth.

The aroma is very sweet, malt and brandy, slight spice but not to complex. The taste is much deeper, initially a bit sweet and vinous, then opening into fig, toffee, prune and toasted malt, and finishing with a strong boozy kick that is a bit on the fusel side. There is not much effervescence and a nice creamy mouthfeel that is well balanced with a bit of diactly butteriness that really works well here, adding up to a very drinkable beer.","ccrida","Feb 03, 2007"

The coloration was a very nice chocolate brown with some pleasing gradations, looking a bit like cider and sometimes wine. Some vinegar-like sourness found its way into the nose, which was also reminiscent of cider and cherries. The taste was, well, absolutely fantastic! A nice balance of malts and alcohol persisted, with caramel, cider, apples, rum, and maple tastes. In some ways, this reminded us of Chimay. The mouthfeel was thick and delicious; carbonation just right. Of course, this is a fairly heavy, alcoholic, dessert-like beer and so a bit less drinkable, but let me tell you that, aint stoppin me.

The smell is very sweet with lots of stewed fruit, a bit of candy sugar, and lots of alcohol. Smells fantastic. The taste is quite good, with the exception of a very pronounced bitterness on the finish that I could do without. Plenty of sweet fruit flavour profiles present here. Also, they seemed to do a wonderful job concealing the 10.5%abv. Mouthfeel is fabulous with an amazing carbonation. It's perfect. It's enough to ""stir the senses", but it isn't offensive and it doesn't ""sting"". I have had plenty of good beers before with a pleasant level of carbonation, but this is really nice.

For the purposes of this review, I poured the ale into a Gulden Draak goblet from a 750 ml white coated bottle. Poured a deep, rich burgundy color that highlights red in the light. Displays a huge, mountainous head of light tan. Nose clubs you with dark, hearty fruits and spice. Dark raisins, cherries, and dates with a yeast bath. A special sweetness is present here as well ... a bit candy-like due to the use of Belgian Candi sugar in the bottle conditioning. Slightly alcoholic nose is present. Palate is extraordinary ...so complex. All of fruits mollases malt, and alcohol - rum like in some ways. The suprise ... this ale is rather hoppy, creating a marvelous balance in the flavor profile. This is master work, really. Full bodied and agressively carbonated, avoiding any semblance of a cloying effect. Though hoppier than many Belgian Strong Darks, Gulden Draak is not at all bitter. Finishes very smooth with a touch of residual sweetness. Gulden Draak is one of my favorites of all time. I love the name, the bottle, the beer ... I could go on and on. This is a world class ale.

Dark and sweet, more like a dubbel, really, but with the kick of a tripel. I frequently compare the taste of dulden draak to that of sweet wine. There is no hiding the 10+% acohol, but the flavors ride well on top of that base. Just the right amount of very bright hops (mint and lemongrass) and sweet, buttery, syrupy malt (black tea and cornsyrup, if not chocolate). Despite the sweetness, there's not sticky mouthfeel, and it drinks like red wine - that is to say very easily, especially if you don't mind the high alcohol.

It has a 3 finger rocky head that pokes above the rim of the tulip and leaves a lot of foamy lace. Toward the end I poured in the rest of the bottle, which gave it a murky, more brown color. It smells of raisins and orange predominantly, but has banana, sour apples, pepper, melons?, bubblegum, and maybe some hops. The first sip is heavy and very sweet with a touch of metal, which is not quite what I was expecting, but let's work with it. As I drink, there are also raisins, apples, cloves, pepper, oranges, and a sweetness that is still there, strong, but not as cloying as it could be considering how malty this brew is. The body has more initial carbonation than I would have thought, but it smooths and becomes near flat by the end of the glass. The drinkability suffers not from the high ABV, which is only evident in a slight warming sensation, but from the strong sweetness.

Quite sweet overall, not a whole lot of bitter to balance it, but I didn't mind. Like a much more refined version of New Glarus' Apple Ale. The 10.5% is almost nonexistent, expertly hidden without bitterness. Another pleasant surprise for the night after DFH's 90 Minute IPA. Good beer night for me.

I'm not so crazy about the first sip, all I'm tasting is alcohol. Second sip I the sweet malt takes over. The aftertaste is powerful and not unlike that of a good port, albeit a bit smokey and most noticably not a port.

The beige foam sat there like a rock, head retention was excellent to say the least. A modest, tight cap lasted the entire consumption. It was welcomed company. The subsequent lacing was spotty and fairly widespread. In honesty the appearance isnt ground breaking in anyway but it is pleasant to look at. Hey, its beer! The nose has always been charming. Chocolate malts provide a lovely foundation that allows an array of spices, fruits, and phenolic characteristics to stand on. There are hints of sweetness upfront with figs, lavender, raisins, tropical fruit, alcohol, and cherries in the middle. Traces of medical qualities and even some herbalness, it is these aromas that I adore in this bouquet, as they really round out the nose. They are strongest at the finish. Moderate potency. The nose is articulate and I can smell, and thus enjoy, every little detail. Sure I wish it was louder but I cant complain. The palate is lovely. Wonderful. It seems so simple but it is beautiful. At first there is a heavy, sweet maltiness that has influences of chocolate and cola. Cherries, prunes, and raisins are soaked in brandy and then they are added to a chocolate purée laced with medicinal spiciness. Clove with hints of banana. Band-Aids. Caramel is also in the mix. Hot alcohol that is close to being distracting, but as is, it adds a fantastic dimension to this beer. There isnt much hiding the fact this beer clocks an abv over ten. The finish is juicy with dark fruits, alcohol heat, spice, and the medicinal qualities. Hot aftertaste, like sucking on rubbing alcohol and Band-Aids; who do that would taste so good? I really like this beer, is it the most complex Belgian Ive tasted? No. Does it strike all the right cords with me? Yes. Medium-full in body, the carbonation is quite active but it feels natural and it works well for this beer, the mouthfeel is pleasant, I like the creaminess. I also like the heat that cuts the sweetness; at times this beer actually seems dry. Exceedingly drinkable, this beer is the perfect nightcap or serve it with a chunk of cheese and a hand of red grapes. I really wish this beer were available in Nebraska; of course it is not. I purchased this bottle as part of a sampler-pack in Ames, IA. Thankfully it can be had in Des Moines or Iowa City. I need to have this on-hand more often.

3.43,-19.1,4.5,4,4,2,2,"Pouring from the faux-ceramic white bottle with the strangely Asian-looking black label, Draak poured beautifully into my abbey-style glass, revealing an extrememly rich-toned beer. At first I seen light ruby, and a dark brown with hints of red, with the slightest touch of light orange.Thick, sedimentary and caramel-thick in body-appearance. A mocha-coloured head formed, which was solid and thick, but was not very consistent throughout my drinking it. Swirling the glass from time to time kept it creamy. Patchy lace, sticky but not screening the glass. The aroma is rather complex, with dark mustiness and phenols dominating. Dark fruits, richly sweet malt. Hints of licorice and leather, horehound, medicinal syrup. Prunes and dates also were quite easy to smell. Initially, the aroma with the glass a good distance from my nose was mouthwatering fruitiness; in closer, the alcohol is immediately evident. Later I sense sourdough and sharp blue cheese. Beastly malt, huge alcohol, and yeast. The flavour at first was metallic, like iron, followed by intense fruit like a cherry brandy, or mollasses. A finish of yeast and oiliness, the everpresent alcohol, and a great deal of bitterness for me. The aftertaste is initially all sweetness, but after a few seconds it leaves the throat very dry and dusty-feeling, which is why I rated mouthfeel and drinkability quite low. The feeling left in my mouth disappointed me: alcohol combined with extreme must is far too dry; mouth-puckering muskiness. Dry tannins as in a rich red wine. This beer literally seemed to purge all saliva from my mouth, and I could actually feel my glands pumping to hydrate my mouth. For me personally, this greatly reduces is drinkability value. Others may not have the same experience. The least taste is in the middle, though it remains full-bodied and resiny. Oily yet gaseous in the mouth. The lees were less sweet, with a strong iron taste. I enjoyed this beer up until the mouth could not handle the dry dustiness. Too much alcohol in the character of it.","Cwrw","Dec 07, 2004"

Unfortunately, I really didn't like the flavor that much either time. A strange, almost soy-sauce like taste, different than any Belgian I've had previously. Lots of foam, nice looking glass of beer. Smell doesn't put me off, but that strange taste never really fades. Also, not as rich in body as the true greats of the style.

The taste is dominated by fruity flavors, mostly plum, there are also sherry/port alcohol elements and an interesting yeast character. The hops are very subdued. This beer is quite good but it is definitely not the best Belgian strong ale I have tried, its too malty and sweet (though by no means cloying). The finish is sweetish and somewhat bitter.

When poured into a Duvel tulip, a large rough tan head rose up, then settled to become a thick, rich, and creamy blanket, which left extremely thick and sticky lacing when the glass was tilted. The beer itself was a dark and murky reddish-chestnut hue. The nose was big on rich figgy malt, with rich accents of pumpernickel bread, and indecipherable spice. The alcohol was completely hidden in the hearty goodness. The real experience started with the first taste. The beer began with a bold, moderately sweet, spicy, malt base that quickly let loose a wonderfully zippy fig/dried tart fruit explosion at the sides of the tounge. This melted into a spicy peach, rum-nutty, warming finish that lingered long after a sip was take. The dragon was a rollercoaster ride of delicious flavor... no spills just thrills and balanced like a yogi. The mouthfeel was richly smooth and full, but not syrupy or sticky. Completely satisfying and extremely delicious, Gulden Draak is simply one of the finest Belgian SD ales available.","HiroProtagonist","Feb 08, 2004"

Smells of yeast, malt, yeast malt, and alcohol proliferate. Tasting the liquid does not disappoint, tastes reinforce the aromas, and the 10.5% alcohol is not so much tasted as felt, warming your mouth and everything on down the body.

The taste was heavy malts and brown sugar with brandy soaked cherries and plums. There were some faint hints of caramel in the finish, perhaps burnt. There was a little hoppiness to the finish, but not much. Alcohol is masked well, making this quite drinkable. A complex ale in a sweet-kinda way, would have liked to see more hops here.

The taste is odd, while attractive all the while-burnt caramel and stewed prune, over ripe-almost rotten banana, and a touch of roasted coffee bean. Some bitter chocolate chimes in on the finish.

Beautiful lacing in the unique tulip-shaped Gulden Draak goblet. Another example of why a goblet is so big whereas the bottle seems so small. Now you know why... Succulent dark fruit aromas interplayed with some mustiness and a big alcohol nose; throw to smallest amount of cocoa butter in the nose and call it well-rounded. Sweet malt texture with some notes of prune and candied dates. Alcohol presence is not in question, it's most in-your-face. Very drinkable for it's ABV.

I can't say the head disappointed, though, as beers this strong rarely muster a healthy head. Now the first sniff. Mmm. Sweet and fruity, but not overly so, with good malt and, dare I say it for a Belgian?, hops. Very, very smooth. Oh, and there's alcohol, too. First sip - smooth and slightly sweet, with a nice blend of sour cherries, molasses, caramel and barley. What really won me over, hophead that I am, was the finish. Along with a healthy alcohol punch, there's a good portion of hoppy bitterness here. It lurks in the opening, but comes out nicely in the finish, and sticks around to balance the aftertaste in a way that feels just right.

In fact the only indication was the warming throat sensation. The taste abounded with figs, mollassas, syrup more dried cherries, and scoops full of brown sugar.

Some chocolate and dark fruit (raisin, plum/prune, cherry, red wine) appear in the nose. The body is medium and nicely creamy due to its very fine, natural carbonation. The flavor is as the aroma indicates with a combination of rich cocoa and ripe dark fruits. It warms across the palate to reveal some softer caramel and alcohol; and a touch of background floral hops. It's very well-balanced by a solid, low-key bitterness.

The flavor is a hodge-podge to search through - rock candy, caramel malt, prune, apple - all in harmony. Despite the overall sweetness, it is not cloying and, while the finish can not be described as clean, it is surprisingly light. And where is the alcohol?

The taste of this beer is ever-evolving as the brew warms. I detected sweet, nutty malt, candy sugar, moderate alcohol, dark chocolate, allspice, nutmeg, cinnamon, a bit of pepper and twangy hops. The finish has somewhat of a warming alcohol and spicy, twangy hop character. The variety of flavors this beer possesses is incredible. The mouthfeel is velvety smooth with a very mild, subdued carbonation that fits perfectly. The potent alcoholic strength of this brew is hard to detect if you don't read the label first.

I swallowed, and to my delight a wonderful hops bitterness came through, riding along side the flavors of coriander and sweet orange peal. My mouth was in heaven, and my pallet demanded more of the heavenly nectar, but my brain cells warned me of the effect that 10.5% alcohol would have on my ability to drive home. So much for driving home, I'm headed to the store to buy more Gulden Draak!!","jaz","May 23, 2003"
3.85,-9.2,4,4,4,3.5,3.5,"A volcanic eruption of bubbles greeted me as I poured this one into it's, short term, new home. It is dark brown with some reddish/orange highlights and an airy tan foam, with lots of carbonation at first. After it settles down it has a big candy sugar aroma with raisins, syrup, and alcohol. Taste, at first, is obscured by the carbonation,this leads to an airy texture that improves if you give it time.The flavor is lightly fruity with powdered sugar, baking spices and a bit of plum, as the carbonation relaxes I can get tobacco and cedar in the finish with plenty of alcohol. The slightly lighter texture and womp of alcohol is a bit much for my 'buds to carry it to the higher scores. A great cigar beer I would imagine.","jeffboo","May 09, 2003"
4.11,-3.1,4.5,3.5,4.5,4,4,"To taste it is to have your mouth set aflame with darker fruits. One sip and you know that it'll hit you harder the more you drink. Very strong but sweet with a warming touch at the end. Sticky mouth feel and goes down fast, too fast if your not carefull! I would love to have this with a favorite cigar and a roaring fire. I'm looking forward to this again!","Ahhdball","May 07, 2003"

4.23,-0.2,4.5,4,4.5,4,4,"Pour is a beautiful dark brown, with a large and long-lasting tan head which leaves great lacing. Aroma is of dark fruits, grape, raisin, plum, some cherry, mild hints of alcohol that become slightly more pronounced as it warms. Flavor is graps, cherry, raisin, and some of the alcohol in the end. Carbonation is fairly lively on the tongue, body is pretty full. Extremely tasty brew here.","goz","Apr 17, 2003"
4.52,6.6,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,4,"This superb brew pours a deep brownish-red akin to a dark, stained wood. A fabulous redolence -- complex and multi-faceted to say the least -- featuring red wine, grape soda, ripe fruits, and brown sugar. The gustatory sense delights as the flavors are primarily the same -- very sweet and delicious, ambrosial even. The mouthfeel is marked by a clear alcohol presence and a lively tango between the tongue and the natural carbonation. A gentle suggestion of dark plum skin graces the mouth as the sip is finished. From its handsome bottle through its delightful finish, this is simply excellent.","marburg","Apr 16, 2003"
4.85,14.4,5,5,5,4.5,4.5,"Even before I opened the bottle I knew this would be a good beer. The white coating on the bottle is simple, yet makes it stad out from all the other beers on the shelf. It has a dark amber color with a huge tan head that is very well retained. One of the best visual beers I know of. Even if it doesn't taste good, the beauty of this beer is worth noting. But fortunately, it does taste wonderful. At 10.5 percent alcohol, gulden draak avoids tasting like whisky like some other high alcohol beers. The caramel-like sweetness hides the alchohol very well. The alcohol taste is apparent, but does not distract you from the malt character.","dmarch","Apr 08, 2003"
4.58,8,4.5,4,5,4.5,4.5,"This is a very interesting and exciting beer to drink. With every sip I enjoyed it a little more. I'd drink and everytime it would hint at a huge hop taste, but then quickly change to the sweet fruity flavors. A wonderful play with your taste buds. It was heavy yes, but easy to drink, like a chilled melted caramel. An exciting beer for a winter evening or if you're up for a nice beer to just slowly sip and enjoy.","taez555","Mar 24, 2003"

4.08,-3.8,4.5,4,4,4.5,4,"Served with a moderate sized, dense tan head atop a red copper body, the beer displayed excellent head retention. The aroma was a well balanced malt and hops aroma which was appealing and begged me to take a drink. Upon taking the first sip, I was hit by a very sweet kaleidescope of flavors, all soaked in alcohol. Then a surprising roasted malt note crept in, with an ever so faint note of hop bitterness in the finish to help sweep away the chewy sweetness. The mouthfeel is excellent, very moist and supple feeling as it coats the tongue. The drinakbility is good considering the sweetness in the flavor and the ABV. This was a very pleasant experience that I hope to repeat sometime soon.","aaronh","Mar 03, 2003"
3.9,-8,4,4,4,4,3.5,"I was lucky enough to find this on tap at Teller's in Hyde Park. Served in an authentic Gulden Draak tulip glass. Dark brown/amber pour with a nice frothy head. Spicy nutmeg aromas. Silky mouthfeel. Light malt profile. Lightly hopped. Very yeasty and bready. The taste of the high alcohol is muted by the spicy malty notes. Very nicely balanced. A good beer.","mickstepp","Mar 01, 2003"

Raisin is the first smell, but this smells like a very complex beer. The taste is very smooth and sweet. There are not a lot of hops in the flavor; it is really malty. There is a definite warming as this beer goes down. Medium bodied. This is a beer that I will try again and again until I completely figure it out.","Amdahl","Dec 18, 2002"
4.23,-0.2,4.5,4,4.5,4,4,"This beer poured a very dark cloudy amber color and formed an off white foamy head that left circular lace when it subsided. An aroma of malt and spice.

While the nose screams alcohol the taste is velvet malt. Intense in it's fruitiness with toffee and caramel notes this Belgian barleywine also exhibits a subtle, rounded hoppiness to add to it's profile. The mouthfeel is an exquisite, smooth, thick wonder. I can imagine medieval monk's drinking this brew for dinner with a smile on their face. I had one on my face for sure. Definitely an after dinner or dessert beer, it would be hard to down many of these with it's alcohol content.","QXSTER1","Nov 08, 2002"

Starts malt, top is light, potently acidic, scantily hopped, long lasting somewhat sour aftertaste. Alcohol also makes itself known as there is a bitterness I attribute to the high ABV. Not bad, different for sure, will have to sample a few to make a true determination about its suitability.","Gusler","Oct 25, 2002"

4.64,9.4,4,5,4.5,4,5,"Deafening rim shot like pop upon release of the cork. Initial gushing diminishes to allow pouring. Deep crimson in hue, w/ a light haze. The dense, thick, sticky dark tan large bubbled head leaves rough lace. Light bubblegum esters are perceived at first in aroma, then are ceded by a pleasantly tart, unripe citrus fruit. Mellow sweetness then follows and is of a dark, molasses and/or dried date like nature. When the brew warms and breathes, dry, powdery chocolate and raisin - like Special B add richness and round the aroma out. Phenol and higher alcohol are present only at a trace. Very enticing and refined aromawise. Caramelized sweetness from both dark caramel malt and dark candi sugar is perceived at first in flavor, then yields to a yeast derived melange of light clove phenol and esters that mirror the aroma, albeit with banana esters more pronounced. Chocolate malt, although somewhat overshadowed by sweetness and yeast byproducts, contributes a subdued, yet rich undertone that bolsters the malt profile and adds to the complexity of this brew. Full bodied, and once the initially high carbonation dissipates, the mouthfeel is rendered agreeably smooth. Hop bitterness is virtually absent, and although malt sweetness is strong, it never becomes cloying. The lack of alcohol flavors and smooth malt profile renders this brew dangerously drinkable. Finishes w/ a hint of biscuit malt giving way to clean caramel sweetness. Gulden Draak is softly sweet, complex and deceivingly light on the palate. Akin to a tripel in overall character w/ mellow chocolate undertones. Delicious! Superb drinkability due to the nearly complete lack of alcohol heaty harshness. Somewhat smoother in the 750 ml bottle versus the 11.2 ounce.","marc77","Oct 07, 2002"

Some notes of dark fruits greet the nose along with some estery yeastiness. Tasting shows fruitiness, alcoholic warmth..sweet first, then drying out due to the hoppiness. A great mix of many taste sensations...truly a remarkable beer! Finishes with some more dark fruitiness & alcohol. This is a real heavyweight of a beer...even by Belgian standards! 2 bottles worth of flavor seem to be packed into 1, very cool white Duvel-style bottle too.","beerluvr","Oct 06, 2002"
4.13,-2.6,5,4.5,4,4.5,3.5,"Smells like an old tyme candy factory with strands of taffey, fudge, vanilla and subtle spices (cinnamon). Notes of chocolate ice cream, date syrup, pepper and alcohol. A creamy, frothy mousse establishes a rich, chewy, melt-in-your-mouth texture. A fantastic beer. From the realm of Baron von Munchhausen. The only possible fault is the aggressive, unmitigated alcohol flavor which keeps the drinkablility score down.","putnam","Oct 02, 2002"
