"I was very happy to snag this beer off the shelf.....saw it was a collaboration with Russian River and about pooped my pants.  Being in the Midwest....we do not get Russian River product!  The beer poured a dark amber with foamy head that didn't hang around long, but left some lace.  The scent is typical of Belgian Quads.  The taste was very evenly balanced and probably the best quad I have ever had.  The mouthfeel was full in body with smooth carbonation.  Overall this is a winner."
""
"Batch #8. Pours a deep clear brown with a thin creamy head that dissipated quickly. It still managed to leave a small amount of sticky lacing. The aroma is a little more yeasty than fruity and sweet but it is still pleasant. The taste is good but a little mild for me, lacking in the big punch of dark fruit and spice that the style is known for. The body has a nice weight to it, with just a hint of carbonation and alcohol on the finish."

"batch #7 brewed 02/14 don't know if each batch varies much but this was a treat imo"
""
""
""
"Pours dark amber with a small, lacy white head.  Has a sweet malt smell.  Taste is malt sweet, with little carbonation.  Overall a nice Belgian Style beer."
"This one was just ok for me. It could be the style, but I just didn’t dig it."

""

"Batch #8. Which has been getting no love on Untappd! Been waiting to try this guy, very smooth mouthfeel. Taste like fresh lemon bread. Very tasty Belgian dark."
""
""
"Sipped on draft at Sancho Pistola's happy hour on Wednesday, March 11th 2015. I paid for it with the last few bucks in my purse and it gave me the best sips I had all week. "
""
""
""
"Batch 7 (2014) with over a year on the bottle. Smell was funky (sour funky) but tasted just like a solid brown."

""
""
""
""
""
"This is a great Collaberation, since we can't get Russian River in Texas!! Don't know why.  But we do get Avery, and I love Belgians.  Really similar to the Russian River Belgians like Damnation, but much more flavor in my opinion."

"Smoothest dark Belgian ale. Excellent!!"
""
"O: Tasty, but too sweet-smooth for me to want to drink a whole bottle. Good sharer. Would have again."
"Received a bottle as a gift this past fall, and it couldn't have been a better surprise!  Incredibly smooth, and a mild warming effect that is perfect for brisk autumn or early winter."
""
"3.28/5.00"
""
"Very flavorful Belgian Strong Ale with an impressive complexity. It is a beer that grows over time. It is so balanced that I drank the whole bottle on my own and didn’t feel cloying, though I would like to be a tad less sweet. It does age well. A must for who likes the style."
""
""
" There's a funny story behind this beer! Avery and another brewery (not sure which one)  both brewed the exact same kind of and named it ""Salvation"". Rather than battling it, they named it, ""Collaboration Not LItigation""."
""
""
""
"The taste is similar to the aroma with an upfront roasted barley malt, toffee, and dark fruit character only to end with a minor bitter bite. Improves as it warms. Very enjoyable."
""
""
""
""
""
"O:  RR Salvation is better on its own than combined with this but this did help to even out Avery's rendition of this beer.  Overall, this is a really good Belgian Strong Dark.  It's very smooth and mellow with great flavors and complexity."

"Pours a deep copper with quickly dissipating head. Lightly fruity apple (acetaldehyde?), raisin, honey and floral nose. The taste follows the nose. The lightly fruity flavors are dominant but pleasant and slightly sweet. Hints of sherry, black pepper and almond/amaretto on the back end. Solvent alcohols and a slightly astringent and bitter finish. The mouthfeel is below average - thin and undercarbed. Overall, this is an interesting beer with nice belgian yeast notes. But as far as Belgian styles falling in the realm of a BSDA or dubbel, this beer is nothing special."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I should expect anything less from something Avery and Russian River got together on, and their result is just a delicious and difficult to pin down as it should be."

"O: I've only recently developed a taste for belgian styles. This is a beer that understands the concept of ""less is more."" Its has a good balance of sweetness and alcohol and spice and a tad bit of funk. It get easier to drink with every sip. I think its brilliant(I've been watching too much BBC)! Its not too sweet. Its not too spicey. I love it! If you love triples and quads then get it while the gettins good! You never can tell how american beer will stand the test of time"

"This belgian style ale pours a hazy reddish brown hue with a foamy white head that leaves generous lacing. The nose is bready with notes of vanilla, banana, and alcohol. Mouthfeel is smooth but thick and a little chewy. The flavor is a robust blend of biscuit belgian yeast, sweet malts, and a nice alcohol bite. A good beer but not the greatest belgian I've had."

"22 ounce bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 1/31/2014. Pours fairly cloudy deep orange copper color with a 1-2 finger dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of pear, apple, golden raisin, banana, clove, caramel, brown sugar, toast, biscuit, pepper, herbal, light nuttiness, and yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of fruity/earthy yeast and dark/bready malt sweetness; with great strength. Taste of pear, apple, golden raisin, banana, clove, caramel, brown sugar, toast, biscuit, pepper, herbal, light nuttiness, and yeast earthiness. Light earthy spiciness on the finish; with lingering notes of pear, apple, golden raisin, banana, clove, caramel, brown sugar, pepper, herbal, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice complexity and robustness of fruity/spicy yeast and dark/bready malt flavors; with a great malt/yeast flavor balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, fairly crisp, and lightly bready mouthfeel that is very nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent Belgian strong dark ale. All around great complexity and balance of fruity/spicy yeast and dark/bready malt flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the big ABV. A very enjoyable offering."

"Very good ale, similar to Pranqster. It's a great sipping brew to end a day with. Sweet flavor with a great nose and mouthfeel. The taste and appearance are typical to many Belgian styles. Would definitely buy in the future and recommend to fellow Belgian ale fans."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Very enjoyable Belgian strong ale. It's so easy drinking that the ABV can sneak up on you."
""
"O- overall this has aged pretty nicely with lots of cherry flavors coming through. I haven't had it fresh to compare but it's held up pretty nicely"
""
""
""
"A very nice stronger brew which goes down easy and has no negative characteristics. My only knock would be that it's a little boring in the taste, but otherwise an above average specimen worth trying."
""
"I know this batch was good as others did not get the same taste profile as I did so I review this based on solely on my experience."

"Overall a rather sweet, but still easy drinking Belgian strong ale. A rather easy drinking brew overall."
""

"This beer meets all the criteria for a Belgian strong ale: big malt flavors, spicy, boozy, and they all blend together and play well together. Bold and memorable."

"Overall: A very good take on a Dark Belgian. Good mix of fruit esters and spices. The two beers are combined very well and avoid becoming a overly sweet mess."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall it hits the spot. It's a solid belgian from two breweries that are deservedly well regarded. Not out of this world, but steady, and sometimes that's just fine."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Nice bouquet of fruitiness but overall detracting alcohol."
"O/D - While seemingly a bit tame, this packs a big punch, the body is spot on, and the flavour is decent. It lacks a whole bunch of flavours that typical BSDAs typically require though, and falls short in so many ways. Maybe it's the youth of the beer, but this just doesn't cut it for the style, and falls even shorter for a collab between these two breweries who are clearly game changers in the craft beer scene. An expensive letdown. While it wasn't a bad beer, you'd expect much more from this stuff."
""
""
""
"Overall it's not that bad, but I don't get excited about this style as much. It doesn't come off as a collaborated mess either like many collaborated beers I've had too."

"Delicious beer from two great breweries. I've had both Salvations hat are blended to create this beer and believe they may be better as individuals. The distinct characteristics of each beer is dulled. Nevertheless a nice Belgian ale that hits the spot."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this is a pretty tasty beer with interesting complexity."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Two awesome breweries join forces to fight the evil of litigation resulting in a beer that is...just not for me. It has been a while since I've had a beer this sweet and the Belgian yeast further pushes the dark fruit envelope to Scars on my palate which told me to run away and never return. A must try just for the sake of craft brewing camaraderie. I really should get the next batch and try it fresh."
""
""
"A great beer, but damn is the flavor different from the nose. It's definitely recommended @ $9/22oz."
""
"Waited a while to try this as I am a huge fan of both breweries. Have not always been a big fan of Belgian dark beers, but this is a great one to share with a few to sip and enjoy."

"4.25/5"

"O: Having not had this beer fresh, I must admit that I have no real basis for comparison. However, this beer is still pretty hot, and I would only expect that to smooth out over time. It's very vinous and fruity, but still not as complex and refined as I was expecting. Just a decent blend as it stands right now, but I'll have to dig up a fresher specimen and see how it compares."
""
""
""
"it's a little thick. the appearance I mentioned was a 'thin caramel' meant to describe the caramel portion of the color, but this is kind of chewy. overall, I like it, though. seems everything Vinnie touches turns to gold. more people know of him than he knows of them, for sure.... this is good."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a great beer. I would like to try this on tap, too. You know, this beer might actually produce several more purchases. I want to try both the Salvation from Avery and the Salvation from Russian River, I want to try this on tap, AND I want to have all prior batches. Avery is a good brewing company and Russian River the same, and this is a great collaboration. Love it!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - a sour Belgium style ale that in my opinion doesn't have a lot of depth. Typically I like this style of beer but was not impressed with this one."
""
"So all in all, I'm not a huge fan, but it's probably worth a try, especially if any of these tastes sound appealing to you."

"O-As a litigation attorney, this beer holds a special place in my heart and, honestly, it is not a bad brew. The sweetness is a touch out-of-balance, but perhaps I sat on this bottle for a little too long and it might be better fresh with a little more carbonation and alcohol heat to counteract the sweet malts. Anyway, as is, this would be a decent choice for a desert beer and it would probably form a nice reduction or sauce for red meat or game."
""
""
""
"Overall: very tasty. I love the strong barley with subtle notes of the rest. The smell could be a little more like the taste but this is a great beer"

"A well blended brew that went down smooth. Not as good as I was expecting but still good. Glad I got to try it on tap though."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I like this beer a lot. I can't get over how smooth it tastes, especially considering its relatively high ABV. I'll buy this one again."
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Hazy faded amber. strong fig jam aroma, tootsie roll. Offensive nose but thankfully the flavor is much more delicate and a lot smoother. Nice almost sherry like sweetness on the tip of the tongue along with some of the flavors found on the nose. Carbonation is almost gone giving the beer a nice creamy body. Definitely worthy of ageing."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"OVERALL: Excellent beer from two class breweries. Everyone can learn a lesson from this. Don't sue each other, just make great beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"D - Very drinkable. Very well balanced with a great blend of body, malts, and yeast character."
""
""
"O- I was kinda disappointed with this beer. But then again, I'm not super pumped on the style."
""
"Overall, what we liked best about this brew was the smoothness of flavoring, sweetness, and surprising saltiness. Both the nose and flavoring gave big buttery qualities, which matched nicely to the heavy, syrupy sweetness of the caramel malt flavoring. The nose was equally as robust, with great butteriness as it warmed. Finally, with the feel following nicely this is a fantastic collaboration between two exquisite breweriea."
"O - An easy drinking Belgian ale with subtle yet complex flavors. I only wish the mouthfeel was a bit heavier. This beer starts to shine as it warms up, as the malts and dark fruit flavors become more prevalent."
"D - Overall its a very good Belgian Strong Dark Ale; balanced deep roasted malt flavor; love the visible yeast sediment"
"O: Overall a pretty solid example of a BSDA. Sweet and fruity with lots of malty flavors and some belgian yeast flavors as well. Mellow and drinkable to boot (perhaps a product of the aging). Enjoyable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Enjoyable and the beer is rather easy to drink for the style - the alcohol is pretty well hidden. I like the story behind this beer and both these brewer's earned respect from me for not litigating. The flavors and aromas are very true to the style."
""
"Overall - Excellent beer that I would highly recommend. Stays true to style, very close to the bellwether of the style, which in my opinion is Chimay Blue. The two beers are very similar in all aspects. Go try this out!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"overall an EXCELLENT beer. i know it's just a cuvee of both salvations, but this is just damn great."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this was a nice beer and I appreciate the story of how it was formed but I feel the authentic Belgian examples are better and would always prefer them over most if not all American interpretations. Definitely higher on the drinkability scale but somehow just doesn't enthrall me enough to want to revisit anytime soon."
""
""
"There's some oxidization, but still, it's drinking pretty good IMO. The age has smoothed this one out and I don't think it's getting much better. I'd probably drink any bottles I had in the cellar, but alas, this was my only one. Decent stuff."
""
"O- Stays on par with Russian River quality on the smell and aroma. I'm not too impressed with the appearance of the chunky floating yeast, but on a good note it didn't change the flavor or aroma of this beer. I could drink this beer with any meal easily."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall I am on the fence with this one. I never tried the Russian River Salvation but I can tell it's very fruit forward and sour. Not bad for a collab."
""
"Medium carbonation with a slightly higher than medium body. The alcohol in this beer is going straight to my head, and I don't know how I feel about that. It's a sipper for sure."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"overall: I don't often give a higher overall score than any of the individual scores but in rare cases like this, it's warranted. Nice job."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, good stuff. Not a standout, but good all around."
"Tasty but a little sweet. I thought the aroma was a little more balanced than the flavor."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - I think this is a bit past prime, as i had this same batch about a year ago and ran out to get another bottle. Still a pretty tasty BSDA."
""
""
""
""
""
"Really liked this beer overall. It went down easy and smooth."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: a superb beer. I regret buying just the one bottle and will try to add more to my cellar. {success: and review tweaked on Aug. 2012)"
""
"Overall a nice collaboration beer, will certainly drink it again."
""
""
"O- Pretty enjoyable, had a nice Belgian feel to it, wouldn't mind picking up another"
""
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel is also great- medium body with moderate carbonation. Pretty rich and smooth. Seek it out!!"
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Quite awesome, but I would expect nothing less from two first-class breweries."
"A delicious beer that has a great story to go along with it."
""
""
"O- tasty beer. I like it. I definitely will buy it again...maybe buy 2 and hold one back for a year or so."
"DOA"
"Overall its a drinkable beer but could use a tune-up. It needs a bit more ""kick"""
"O: This is a phenomenal beer that i cant help but keep buying. And i cant wait to try the Batch 5 that has been cellaring in my basement for over a year. A flavor bomb that does nothing but please my taste buds. Highly recommended."
"Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Pours a dark orange amber. Fine two finger off-white head with good retention and lots of lacing. Aroma of Belgian yeast and spices, dark fruit. Taste follows with intense sweet dark and dried fruit, especially sweet raisins and caramel malt. Spicy and a bit dry in the finish. Nice flavor progression. Approaching heavy bodied with a nice creamy and spicy carbonated mouth feel. Very nicely made take on a Belgian strong dark."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured into a chalice, a ruddy red-orange color, murky, with a solid, off-white head and moderate carbonation. Blatant Belgian yeasts and esters in the aroma, candi sugar and dried fruits. Basically the same on the tongue, Belgian yeast, dried papaya, banana esters, raisins, cloves, with a subtle citrus character. Medium mouthfeel, and pretty drinkable overall."
""
""
"This is a fine ale; I'm glad I got to try it. I'm not sure it has improved with the years I've been sitting on it, but it was a fun experiment. I'd certainly drink this one again, as it appears that it is still in production."
""
""
""
""
""
"D ~ Letting this reast before opening was a great idea. Way better than Avery's Salvation, that one was a letdown for me. I have Russian River's Salvation that I will be trying a few days after this. This beer is excellent. I would love to make a sauce out of it, if only I didn't drink every drop."
"O- really enjoyed this beer. Very drinkable for the style and loved the sweet dark fruits in this beer."
""
"O: A good example of a Belgian Strong Dark Ale. Was hoping for maybe something unique added to the taste or aroma that would set it apart from other BSD's, but I wasn't able to distinguish anything like that."
""
"22oz bomber poured into my Chimay glass. Bubbly beige head atop a rusty, orange-reddish ale. Good lacing, decent head retention. Aromas are fruity, Belgian yeast, maybe some apple, boozier as it warms. Tastes are also fruity with notes of green apple, apricot, well balanced with the alcohol well concealed. Mouth-feel is medium bodied and well carbonated. Overall, very drinkable and enjoyable. Nothing fantastic, but couldn't find anything wrong with it either."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I have enjoyed the Avery Holy Trinity series in the past and was excited to try this one. For sure would like to try the Russian River Salvation. Very nice mix."
""
""
""
""
"not as good as i wanted it to be, but still exciting. batch number 6. poured a quad looking red brown color with a modest off white head into a la trappe goblet. smells belgian yeasty, and like a less sweet salvation from avery. i think the russian river salvation is much darker and potent, almost dominating in this blend. flavor is belgian candy sugar, molasses, caramel malts, dried fruit, and yeast yeast yeast. feel is nice, smooth and bright, strong and easy down. i like this beer a lot, i like it as much for the idea as for the final product, and in fact, i wasnt that impressed with this, but i support the concept fully. they should team up and do a big stout..."
""
""
"O: This isn't bad at all. If I happen upon another bottle of this, I'd pick it again. Solid."
""
"Pours a deep amber with a thin finger head that disappates quickly. Smells of caramel, straw, dark cherries and raisins. Comes off tasting a bit oaked, malty and a bit syrupy. Carbonation is pretty mild and it is a tad thick, fitting of the style. Overall a solid beer that I would enjoy again."
""
""
""
"This is a dark, orange brown beer with a off-white head, with a medium-strong hold. It smells a little sour with some fruity properties. Has a yeast flavor to it and it finishes very bitter. This beer is very complex and has a lot of qualities to it. I enjoyed it very much."
""
"Overall, it is a great beer with interesting flavors and tastes. I enjoyed the live yeast. I would buy this again for sure."
"Overall, I wasn't a fan of this beer at all. The think mouthfeel combined with the umami taste was too overwhelming for me."
""
"Low carbonation with a low hold on the glass. Low head as well. Amber color. Aroma smells like dark chocolate. It is a little spicy as well probably because of the Hops. It has a malty/ vague sweetness to it. Light mouth feel. Excellent beer to drink and rare as well"
"Overall: I overall enjoyed this beer a lot. The chocolate flavor is what made this beer great. This is the first beer that i tried where I can see live yeast which adds aesthetic appeal to it when poured. I can only imagine how much more flavor will come out of it if it was aged even longer."
"Collaboration not Litigation- another delightful smelling beer. My second favorite smelling beer so far. It has a strong scent of soy sauce and it is very appealing! The dark, brownish color of this beer is lovely as well. There are particles that float to the bottom, must be the live yeast that gives it its taste! The mouthfeel is not too heavy, and overall this is one of the best beers I have tried!"

"This pours a copper color with a quick fading off white head that leaves some lacing on the glass. Smells of some funk, pear, grains, and raisins. Pretty good smelling beer. Taste is pretty smooth and mellow. Some fruits with a slightly alcoholic finish. Medium bodied. I enjoyed this."

"Appearance has a hazed copper color producing a thin head with moderate dissapation leaving spotty lace. Smell of Belgian yeast, spice, dark fruits having a light barnyard note. Taste as with the aroma thats a little musty maybe even a little more barnyardy. Mouthfeel is medium with good carbonation. Ok for the style, have had better."
""
""
""
""
""
"Cheers."
""
""
""

"Overall: Might need to be little tweaked. Little more alcohol taste might help or maybe a hint of fruit. Sorry I have built a slight bias when is comes to anything of Belgian ales and the way they should taste and obviously feel. Try it for your self and cheers to all!"

"Medium bodied, it coats the mouth well and soothes going down. After letting it warm a little I did detect just a little alcohol in the background, with a little burn building near the end of the beer. Very solid offering."
""
"O: I would say if the taste lived up to the nose, i would have been much happier. still this is a fine offering and I think the 1 year of age did this some good."

"O: Was happy when I seen this on the shelf. Never heard of it and it was already aged for me. Glad I only paid $6.99. Not digging this at all."
"O: While this beer has some good qualities, it comes off the rails at critical junctures (i.e., the taste). Very uneven."
"High C+"
"Batch #5 Bottles Jan 2011"
"Overall: I sure expected more from an Avery/Russian River collaboration. Not bad, drinkable despite the ABV, but just not something I will revisit. OK but disappointing."
"A certifiable miss."
"Fuller body, slightly lower carbonation, sticky and coating on the tongue. Pretty decent, some age has mellowed this but there's still some decent heat in the nose."
"Smells of dark fruits, raisins, a little molasses, and candi sugar. Similar notes in the taste, with that nice chewy, sweet yeastiness that you find in well-made Belgian Strong Dark Ales. With nearly three years in the bottle this developed some nice character and was thoroughly enjoyable, like Leslie Nielsen. I hope to have each of the respective Salvations blended to make this some day soon, assuming I survive the lunar landing."
"A very interesting and very complex brew. Evidence of the collaboration is definitely present. Two complaints: the musty character is off-putting to me, though it is appropriate in this beer. Second: the amount of carbonation leaves something to be desired."
"O-oh wow i'm a fan of this. much more so than i expected. i actually enjoy this more than the Russian River Salvation itself. its a great BDSA and does a great job setting itself apart from others. this is so much more than a cute little concoction of the 2 breweries striving to be clever, its an outstanding example of the style. its so smooth and can either be quaffed or sipped for extended enjoyment."
"O: Yum. 4"
"O- Sat on this for a couple of months...atleast. Really enjoyed this beer. Would definitely purchase again."
"D- Overall, I'm not a huge belgian beer fan, but this beer grows on you. Tons of malty goodness with plenty of complexity to balance the sweetness. By the second half of the bomber, I'm actually really digging it. The sticky toffee dessert character is just hitting the spot with all the other complex belgian beery flavors going on."
"This is a terrific beer that exemplifies great execution of a Belgian strong/dark, even if it's not quite as dark as I would have liked. One thing that's strange about this beer is the accuracy of its abv (down the the hundredth!). Even if 8.72% is a strangely accurate number, it does a nice job to amplify, yet not overpower the beer's other flavors. This beer is worth the money and definitely worth trying."
"This is a medium bodied brew with a light level of carbonation. It is fairly decent drinking and a fair take on the style but not something I would seek out again. There is nothing wrong with it but it is pretty average across the board and well... forgettable."
"The mouthfeel is on the heavier side with a nice creaminess to it. Carbonation is a little below average. Overall it was a pretty solid beer, it had some very nice malty flavors to it and the yeast spice wasn't overpowering which I liked. Very drinkable and tasty beer overall."
"Final thought - at $8 a pop and 8+% abv, this is a great deal. I love collaboration beer that is good. Much love to Russian river and avery"
"PP (Price Point) - $10.99 for a 22oz is a somewhat average bang for the buck, Definitely worth it if you are a Belgian Ale fan!"
"This was split between a few people at the Farmhouse in Emmaus. The pour was a dark brown, and had a quick fading fizzy tan head on it. The smell of the beer was yeasty and had a light nutty aroma and some sweetness to it. The taste of the beer was rich with dark fruit and brown sugar, there is some nice yeasty flavors also. The mouthfeel was a little on the thinner side, has some little bubbles on the tongue. Overall this beer was just above average. Nothing too fantastic here."
"the beer is drinkable and decent nothing to go crazy about"
"Note: Batch #5, Bottled in January 2011"
"The taste is along the same lines. Belgiany, like a dirty, dark saison. Nothing great or special. It's a bit too thin, but it is drinkable and smooth. I'm not going to say no to the rest of the bottle, but frankly, I kind of wish I was just drinking my homebrew. That's not something I want from what could be a good BSDA."
"Batch 4"
"O - This was very good. I happened upon this by chance actually, was just walking towards the register and saw the avery silver foil from the bottom shelf of a rack. I was pretty stoked when I grabbed it and read the label and the batch #. Age did some good things to this beer, and this might be the best stab at a Belgian from an American brewery that I've tried. Collaboration sucess!"
"Overall Drinkability - Top notch. Like a cross between a quadrupel and a tripel."
"O - It was certainly an above-average brew, but that's as far as i'm willing to go. It was my first taste of anything with the Russian River name on it and I was slightly disappointed. I could drink this daily, but it would never stick out as one of the great belgian ales i've had..."
"O - I picked up pretty much what I expected by looking at the style. It's a nice beer but for the price I'd probably go with something else next time. Overall It's pretty drinkable for the ABV, and I enjoyed it's bready and malty flavors with it's smooth, creamy feel. I say pick it up for sure, especially if your a Belgian brew fan. Cheers!"
"o: Not bad at all. Alcohol is well hidden. Not too heavy. Priced a little high for what you get but overall, great beer."
"We had this one on tap yesterday at Avery. Poured a nice deep, dark brown color, with a smallish light brown head. Aromas of dark caramel, candi sugar, malt and light hops. On the palate, this one was medium bodied, with dark fruit, milk chocolate and a bit of spice. Nice to see a collaboration of this sort."
"Overall this is all right, but not the sort of thing I'd get again. I tend to be a bit suspicious of mixing two different styles to begin with."
"O: Ho-hum...: I never thought I would use that to describe a RR (or even an Avery) beer. I had this one once last year before I started reviewing and didn't think much of it then either. It certainly looks like my taste for this one hasn't changed..."
"Looking forward to Batch #6..."
"Strong flavored beer up front muddies up a bit the longer it stays on the palate and as the bottle wears on but lingers nicely and sticks to the ribs. Despite the flavor being overshadowed, the other qualities make up for it and make an interesting and overall pleasant beer."
"Pours a reddish brown with a thick, creamy off-white topper. Good retention and pretty good lacing all the way down. This brew smells of Belgian yeast, dark fruit, brown sugar, sweet biscuit, spice, with some fruity esters and some faint booze. The taste follows the nose but adds some earthy notes to the mix. I find that the flavors play nicely together. Medium body and medium carbonation round out this beer. Good and tasty for sure! Unique idea (not suing) and I hope they do it again soon."
"Would be good with some Asiago cheese for sure."
"A delicious Belgian-style strong dark ale."
"D: All things considered, this is very drinkable, even beyond the 220z serving, which is a good indicator for a beer of this almost 9% abv. I would usually lean away from beers of this strength and knock them down on drinkability due to sweetness or maltiness issues leading one to feel overly stuffed, but this doesn't impart that feeling."
"O - Very enjoyable beer. Somewhat heavy on the palate. Alcohol is very well hidden, but there's a lot going on here."
"D: This is a very good collaboration from two great breweries. It's complex but a very easy drink. It has a higher ABV but it's hardly noticeable. Not quite top tier BSDA, but a nice intro beer to the style."
"overall - I've never had either beers separately, but it's a blend well done."
"Looks simple as any brown ale could: brown with orange highlights. The smell is a wonderfully layered blend of big malts, floral notes, and spices from the Belgian yeast, all subtle, yet noticeable. The taste brings in more earthy notes and dried fruit sweetness with a velvety feel and an excellently masked %ABV. Top notch."
"-Cheers"
"O- I don't know how old this is or how long it sat on the shelf but it seems to be a slight bit oxidized. That or there is something a little off about it."
"Fairly delicious beer that I'm happy to have tried!"
"Draft to pint glass. It's good, but not quite as good as I expected. Of course, I had inflated expectations because the name on the board read ""Avery Collaboration BSA," so I thought it was an inter-brewery collaboration beer, which set my expectations pretty high. Good color, forgettable boquet, good flavor. I could take it or leave it in the future; depends on if I'm buying or not ;)"
"I have always loved this beer, and I dranks it up. Off tap, in bottle, from the faucet, I would drink this beer. A bottle is plenty late at night and 22oz is the perfect size. One year is a great time to pop one if ya gotz it. I think these have some cellaring capabilities, maybe i'll put one down for a while."
"Drink- Great collaboration. Nice to see some people working together. A well done rep of the style with nice flavors and not overbearing. Id like to have an aged bottle to see if it becomes a bit thicker on the feel."
"One of my favorites from Avery which has a dickhole bartender from Scotland."
"Overall: Different than the rest, which I like, but only a good beer, at best."
"Batch #5, bottled January 2011. Pours hazy and reddish brown. Stiff and foamy off-white head that lasts and leaves good lacing. Bready malt aromas, some hints of chocolate and dark fruit. A bit of spiced yeast notes as well. Rich malty flavor as well bready with a touch of caramel sweetness. A little bit of spicy esters but overall the Belgian character is a bit weak.. The taste is a bit underwhelming but the beer has a rich, creamy, full mouthfeel."
"M/D: Medium bodied with nice carbonation. Overall a pretty good beer, wouldn't expect anything else from these two breweries."
"Awesome, I would recommend this to all, I wonder how RR's is?"
"Atmosphere is really solid. Dark cloudy appearance with a decent enough head, and some nice beer ring lacing. Nose is great combination and balance of malt and sweet notes. Flavor is malty and sweet, and a thick syrupy body. Well-balanced. Overall, this is a great quaff."
"Drinkability: Its a really tasty beer. The gimmick of combining these beers somehow worked great. I wish it was slightly less spicy, but overall, very good."
"A slightly hazed copper color with a decent white cover and nice lacing. The aroma brings pineapple clove and nutty caramel, and deep hazlenut. Very classy smell. The flavor says spicey grass hop with a sweet malt-honey with lemon bite. This is complex and improves as it warms and the clove qualities mellow into the malty sweetness. It has a refined carbonation and is medium-plus body with a tingly, easy flowing feel that is drinkable enough considering the presence of some alcohol. Good stuff which we had aged for nearly two years."
"D - The drinkability here is good. I really like this beer. It has a nice deep rich flavor. I hope I get the chance to try this one again, and I definitely recommend picking it up."
"This beer proved to be more interesting than I had expected. Someday I hope to try the constituent parts."
"D: I wonder if this category shouldn't be Drinkability/Memorability. With the ABV being what it is, this is a beer to be savored and appreciated, and I will remember it fondly for some time to come."
"Matt"
"This is batch 1, dated January of 2007. This beer pours a dirty muddied amber/brown with a reddish tint. It featured an off white head which laced the glass. It smells of sweet California raisins, banana, yeast bread, figs, and dark malt. This beer tastes like raisin bread plain and simple. It has good flavor, moderate sweetness, and is very drinkable. Being four years old it is maximizing its potential right now as a Belgian Strong Dark. I may have to buy another while I still can."
"I love collaborations like this, especially if they're not one-offs and I get to try future batches. Cheers!"
"D: Starts out very good. And gets better with each sip. I love how this beer transforms in such a short period of time. Drinking incredibly well (and fast) right now."
"Poured from a 22 ounce bomber into a pint glass. The beer pours a deep, cloudy copper-amber color with a thin, quickly disappearing head. Heavy hops on the nose, with fruity sweet and some spice on further inhales. The beer has a bold bouqet of flavors that blend together extremely well. Sour backbone, with some spice notes to it, and a huge projection of bitter hops. The beer is forward, strong and full in mouth, but transitions to a surprisingly smooth and crisp finish. There is a lingering sour and spice balanced aftertaste. The beer is pretty impressive; very well blended and balanced, and the strong flavors do not limit the drinkability in any way. This is a good, strong (pun intended) beer."
"Drinkability- too heavy to be anything but a sipper."
"Had this on tap at Rattle N Hum in New York City. Pours a copper-amber colour with thin off-white head. My cell phone auto-correct seems to say I wrote ""old"" lacing, but I'm going to assume I wrote there was ""some"" lacing. Sweet toffee and brown sugar aroma, still some hops come through. A very sweet flavour, balanced off by faint bitterness. Medium bodied carbonation."
"D: Good beer. If you like aged barleywines, but don't want any bitterness or hops, this is a great alternative. Also would be a great suggestion for someone who like Marzen style beers and wants something stronger."
"D - 1 is enough for now. I will drink it again though."
"I might recommend this too someone timid about the strong flavors of Belgian beers looking for something more middle of the road."
"Highly drinkable. It smells and tastes great and despite the alcohol, there's no burning. With the alcohol and spices you keep expecting some heat, but it's just a happy sweetness."
"D: I could have quite a few of these. Outstanding offering. I will purchase again, if I can."
"Quite drinkable, I was worried when I realized this bottle was about 18 months old. I was pleasantly surprised when I had it, and if I could find another of this vintage, I would."
"jd"
"Would be nice with coq au vin. Or even warm German red cabbage with cloves and vinegar."
"Mouthfeel is a bit lighter than I'd like but the finish is nice and smooth, it's very bready and yeasty with a light tartness that's nice but not over the top. Something is a bit odd about the beer though, I guess it's just an odd mix of beers. Super cool concept, not the best result."
"Drinkability: An interesting beer from Avery and Russian River. I enjoyed this as the style isn't one that drink regularly, but I do enjoy this one. Will probably buy again."
"Great mouthfeel, good carbonation on the tongue. The drinkability would've been a bit higher if this agreed more with my tongue. There is also the high ABV to consider."
"Pours a hazy orange-ish to copper color with an off white head. In the aroma, a caramel like malt and light pine hops. In the taste, caramel stickiness and a gingerbread like malt sweetness. A small bite and medium bodied mouthfeel, with a semi dry caramel and dry coffee aftertaste. Interesting representation of style, sweet to dry, and quite nice."
"This beer is what you'd hope for when you hear two world class breweries like Avery and Russian River are collaborating on a beer. In lieu of writing some sort of summary type thing, I'll note that I paired this with some homemade banana bread, which turned out to be an unsurprisingly good idea."
"D: I'm not a huge fan of this one. Perhaps fresh is better. I found this to be too sweet and fruity without enough spice. Not too hard to drink, but the aftertaste is a big unpleasant. I didn't slam it in the score because I don't think it's a bad or not well crafted beer, it's just not for me."
"It's nice to see a collaboration turn out well between two highly respected breweries."
"Highly enjoyable beer...Almost a perfect beer!"
"D - I'm impressed and could have a few."
"D: Good beer, I'll have no trouble getting through this 22oz. Would buy again."
"While writing my notes and then typing them up, I drank 2/3 of the bottle and definitely feel a nice head buzz occurring. Very tasty, and for someone that is learning the ropes on beer reviewing, it is quite a nice treat. At $8.71 per bottle in my location, I think it is money well spent. Compared to the Russian imperial stouts, this is a faster drinking, smoother, and somewhat less complex beer style, but nonetheless very good. This ale would be a good one for a hot summer day while grilling some chicken or pork. 7 out of 10 beer mugs is my final score."
"In the mouth feel, it there is a lot of carbonation as usual, and the alcohol is hidden decently. This beer is a kind of let down, but not a horrible beer... I just expect more from Avery than this."
"D: Like most dark belgian ales it's not something you're going to just pound back, especially at nearly 9% ABV. The smoothness of this one makes it go down pretty quickly though. I could drink it till I fell off my chair."
"D - Very good beer, I am sure I will enjoy another in the future."
"This was a good beer. Definitely not one I'd revisit often as it's a bit much; but great for celebrations and special times. Recommend."
"Luckily for me, the beer tastes better than the aroma. The flavor features brown sugar, caramel malt, and phenols. Tastes better than it smells. Medium bodied, nice carbonation, smooth, easy to drink, and the alcohol is well hidden. A nice collaboration which I recommend trying."
"D - A very good beer. One of the better Belgian Style Ales that I have had."
"Overall, this is a rather nice Belgian. I'd say I'll be sure to have some again, but unless they rebrew it that looks unlikely."
"D - Good think I shared this bottle. It's a good beer but a bottle alone would definitely be a little much. Tasty and well-blended, it's just a bit too sweet."
"Interesting, but not something I would seek out again."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied. Drinkability is complicated. The alcohol is not present, but the intense tongue numbing effect make it slightly hard to drink."
"Excellent carbonation and layers of sweetness and bitterness that keep a medium-heavy body. Very drinkable for the style."
"DB- Nice fruit on top of the standard Belgian flavors. Price was not bad at all. Still good aged."
"D: Good"
"D-I polished off the bomber effortlessly. Really goes down nicely, and the alcohol is hidden fairly well. This isn't the most complex I've ever had, but it sure is tasty and easy to drink. Definitely worth picking up a few bottles if you see it locally."

"D - Good beer with a weird bitterness to it. I like the idea of mixing brews from different companies after each brew has been made (as opposed to a single brew that is made using ideas from different companies like the Stone collabs)."
"an easy drinker with a good amount of flavor."
"Alcohol somewhat hidden."
"D: Wow, this beer has reached a good point in the aging process."
"Served from bottle into a Chimay goblet. Pours copper with a small amount of tan sediment present with a one finger white head that has a dusting of brown sediment that subsides to minimal upon sitting. There was nice lacing throughout. The aroma was comprised of bread, malt, and fruit. The flavor was of fruit, bread, small hint of alcohol, and a hit of sweet malt upon swallowing. It was medium on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was quite an excellent brew. It is by far one of the best brew mixes I have tasted to date and will be hard to top. It really makes me want to go back and drink Avery's and get ahold of Russian River's to pick out the aspects of each and compare them to the 'collaboration'."
"It has a good fresh fruit taste to it with some bread and smoky malts. I like that it isn't too sweet, it has a moderate thickness and goes down smooth. Glad they joined together for this brew."
"D: truly easy to drink with mild alcoholic warmth. Wish I hadn't shared this bottle!"
"I've had this a few times in the bottle and have always liked it. Not the best from either brewery but pretty good none the less. The draft version is good as well. The flavor and aroma have a good dark maltiness. Hops is present but not overwhelming. A very good beer if you can find it."
"Taste: Sweet, ripe plums up front with candylike sweetness. Some herbal hoppiness. The middle gets a little dry and more bready than fruity with complex phenolics. Finish is bready, yeasty, drastically increased spiciness and is moderately bitter."
"bounces back and forth between nutty and spicy. These flavors are complemented by notes of orange zest, coriander, baking spices and light, dry hops. The hops emerge as the dominant flavor on the back end,providing a dry, pleasant finish. They have improved on this beer since the first batch. Looking forward to the next one!"
"I'll enjoy a big 22 oz bottle of this. I would like this very cold on a cool spring or fall evening and warm on a winter's eve. Well done ""collaboration"" between Avery & Russian River."
"3.5/3/3/4/4.5"
"D: Quite a drinkable brew from Avery."
"Edit: Lowered my ratings of taste and smell by 0.5. Revisited the brew, and I think I exaggerated the ratings a bit because I had been on a run of so-so beers. Either way, still a solid offering."
"Carbonation is assertive and the mouthfeel is fairly dry. This will go well with food. I think I'll have my second glass with some cheese and crackers."
"This seems like a solid Belgian Strong Dark, that isn't very dark, on par with the two Unibroue offerings I've had."
"Pours a rich amber color with lots of pale, frothy head. Large particles float to the top of my glass; this beer might contain more sediment than any commercially-made beer I've had. The smell is sweet and yeasty - not exactly what I anticipated. Feels wonderfully silky and smooth on the palate. Sweetness is dominant, as the Belgian candy and turbinado sugars really show through. This is definitely a well-crafted beer; I've never had anything quite like it. My main quibble is that it's too sweet for my taste, but that's clearly what they were going for, so I can't complain too much about it."
"D - Not my favorite BSDA by a long shot, but I couldn't resist trying the product of a Russian River and Avery collaboration. All in all, not all that impressed. Glad I tried it, but I won't be seeking it out again."
"D - So much spice it becomes hard to drink. Very dry finish doesn't help, but for the alcohol it's not bad."
"Overall, not great, I wouldn't recommend this."
"M/D: Medium body with good carbonation. The beer was easy to drink and the alcohol was hidden well. A good beer and while this style is not my favorite typically, this one I enjoyed."
"D - Not tremendously impressed. It is generally okay, but unspectacular and not a combination of flavors that I appreciate particularly. Someone should consider litigation over this collaboration."
"Gotta say, this was pretty disappointing. The flavors were too heavy & muddy, alcohol too alcoholic. Really wanted to like this one, but it struck me as a generic Belgian-esque interpretation."
"This drink holds much pleasing complexity, especially in the flavors. Every sip is an adventure, although it is rather consistent throughout. The lightness aids in drinkability and the alcohol is blended well. A long dryness at the finish helps increase the desire for another take."
"d - Overall I loved this one. I had several bottles of Batch #1 of this beer a few years ago and remember enjoying it, but had always drank them fresh. I think the 2 years on this bottle has definitely helped it. Very smooth and easy to drink for almost 9% ABV, and I did not get any hints of alochol in the smell or taste. A nice subdued dark fruits and malts smell and taste made this a great beer. Would love to try again."
"D - This isn't super complex, but it's a very drinkable beer and interesting enough to pair with a lot of different foods, especially spicy foods, I think."
"D: A surprisingly good brew with an interesting spicy, sour yet malty flavor. I wish all collaborations were this good. I think the year helped tone down the sourness and gave it a nice fruity yet tart and dry flavor and feel."
"It's pretty drinkable. It goes down easy for a high alcohol beer."
"Overall: Though my general dislike for belgians may have affected my scoring, This one's a keeper."
"Drinkability: Not a session beer for sure but was surprisingly great with my food."
"Easy to drink."
"drinkability - hey when the taste is not there - why do i want to drink it"
"Delicious nose... rich, herbal, slightly hoppy. Definitely stands out as a Belgian-style ale. The taste is a little bitter up front, the herbal notes come through as well. It's good but a little harsh and tougher to drink. Not quite up to par with the best of the style but still a damn fine beer."
"Great nose right out of the bottle, strong malty aroma. Firm head with a nice golden brown appearance. The first taste left me wanting more but after a couple sips the flavor really came out. It has a good malty flavor and a slight bitterness at the end. There's not a strong alcohol flavor considering it's a 8.97%. I wasn't overly impressed but I'd give it a second chance."
"Decent drinkability, but I'm not thrilled with this one. Don't think I'll seek it out again."
"Two finger plus head of light tan foam, dense but dissolves speedily, you can literally watch the bubbles pop, thick ring of lacing around the entire insides of the glass. Heavy cloudiness darkens the amber orange color, fully opaque with minimal lightening at the rims. The nose goes heavy on the clove, ginger spice, banana, apricot, cherry fruit, raisin bread, malty chocolate, light sweet smoke and tar accents, mixed grapefruit and granola, hops display a subtle influence, particularly in checking overall sweetness level. Full-bodied, not quite ""foamy"" but the carbonation creates a mouthfilling sensation. Sweet, yet, achieves a noticeably dry finish at the same time. Clove, ginger, anise spice, here less overt fruitiness, more raisin, fig with touch of apricot. Yeasty, but raw not bready. Caramel, maple syrup, chocolate powder, maltiness restrained. The citrus more muted and mixed here. As nothing gets exaggerated it maintains a high level of drinkability, even if it's not that intellectually compelling."
"Mouthfeel is rich and spicy. Drinkability is very good. I split the bottle, could have easily finished it."
"CHEERS!!!"
"Skål!"
"While I like a lot of what is going on with this beer, the lack of balance and the high alcohol content means it will only be an occasional addition to my fridge."
"The body was very good, fulfilling without being dominating. Drinkability was very good for a brew of this strength. Overall, I wish I had had this beer sooner, it seemed rather muted. I suspect when fresh it would have been an explosion of flavor in the mouth. Still, it's worth trying if you can."
"A fantastic, heart-warming American story, resulting in a pretty good, and drinkable, analogue to the Belgian greats."
"D-this is big and tasty. i actually really like it but i don't get any hint of a belgian ale here. more like an english barleywine."
"D - very well done"
"I poured this screwed up brew into my tumbler at 45 degrees. The beer was cloudy and kinda of orange. The beer was full of black flakes and all kinds of junk. The beer had a sour smell and sure had a sour tase with a sweetness that was sickening. I poured the beer out and will not buy again. If this is what they are going to Belgian to learn how to make I pity the fool that buys the beer."
"Notes: Unable so far to reach Russian River, this is a close as I've got for now, and the brew leaves the expectations still very high. With Avery I have a hit or miss relationship, I had not tried their Salvation either, but this is one where the final craft works rather well regardless of what is Avery or what is RR, and it makes for a very pleasing and recommendable BDA."
"(D)- Probably a great beer earlier on in its life, but still decent in its near 2 year aged form. Not too bad. Definitely starting to show its age though."
"HIGHLY RECOMMEND!"
"Cheers"
"D - I wish I could have gotten my hands on both Avery's and Russian River's Salvation Ale, so I could tell what characteristics of each beer are lent to this one, but a blind tasting will have to do"
"Drinkability: decent beer. i'd get it again."
"Drinkability is superior to many others out there. This is a great beer, so much going on. Happy to have had the chance!"
"Pours a hazy, cider brown with a frothy, yet quickly diminishing khaki colored head. Good retention. The smell reminds me of a barrel aged American Wild Ale... yeasty, slightly sweet light fruit, hints of dark fruit. Taste is pretty different from the smell... bready malts, almost a brown ale in quality. Light and dark fruits mix - pear, apple, raisin and plum. Mellowed yeast impact. Body is medium, slightly undercarbonated at this time, still smooth, but would prefer prickly. An interesting beer that trues to be too many things at once, plus the 2 years on it may have impacted it negatively."
"A nice homage to the strong Belgian ales, this brew is a nice mix from two brewers and a fine beer that I would definitely have again. I look forward to trying the other collaborations as I very much enjoyed this beer and it's sweet complex flavors!"
"D: split the bottle with my lady, and while this was good enough that i might come back (or try to get both salvations and then do the trio with a cheese plate!) we're switching over to sophie..."
"Medium-bodied with some alcohol slickness and perfect carbonation (probably a result of three years in the bottle). A very unique beer that almost defies categorization."
"D= Really a solid collab. This is as close to Russian River beers that I'll get in MN and it delivers quite well. I actually think I can taste characteristics of both brewerys in the beer. Very cool beer by some very cool guys. Worth checking out."
"All in all, a great idea and a great brew!"
"D - Very good. The high abv cannot be felt at all which makes you crave another glass."
"Drinkability: Sitting at 9% ABV, it's been a tough one to drink on a weekday. I probably should have cracked this bottle open a little sooner. It's an enjoyable beer, but I don't think I'll pick it up again. Perhaps the style isn't to my liking."
"D: Pretty good offering, solid and tasty with a fair amount of complexity that stacks up pretty well to some of the other good BSDA out there."
"Overall a likeable beer."
"Very pleasing aroma, smells creamy and rich. Medium Brown coloring with a ton of particles floating in it. Light, creamy head. Low hop flavor, very rich, creamy flavor with hints of citrus. Slight alcohol burn. Aroma and flavor stay in your nose, making you crave another sip. Damn fine beer!"
"Wouldn't mind trying the other batches."
"D-Nice but I don't know if I can finish a bomber of this stuff, one glass was nice though."
"uscaptainsblog.blogspot.com"
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied with good carbonation and slightly slick, coating the tongue with the sugary flavors. All in all, it's a decent Belgian style ale but not one I would go back to again."
"D - for me, low. not a fault of any particular characteristic other than the taste. one time only for this beer for me."
"Best Avery beer I've tried."
"This beer had a decent amount of sediment which hurt my opinion of it but I am leaving an unbiased review of the beer as if it had none. Just thought potential buyers would like to know. Average IMO. The Avery Salvation was much better. Off flavor somewhere in this bottle. Dark raisin and prune juice. Red apple and fig jam. Silky,foamy and dry texture. Wasn't bad but I won't buy it again."
"This is from the first batch, I believe; Jan 2007. Poured into my basic snifter glass. The ale appears a hazed amber brown color with about an inch of creamy light ecru foam. Nice head retention with minimal lacing. Nose and flavors are of caramel, raisins, plums, brown sugar, molasses, sweet bread, yeast, ripe pears, dates, bananas. Approaching full bodied with ample carbonation. Wish I had another bottle of this vintage to try again in a year or two."
"If possible, I would drink this all day, but I only have one bottle"
"I wasn't blown away by the bottle I had a year ago, but this old keg is great."
"This is a tasty beer and quite good across the board. It's different than I expected, although I haven't had either of the two original beers. It's really fruity and I was expecting darker malt flavors and darker fruits, but I'm still pleased with the brew. Definitely worth picking up."
"Poured from a 22oz bottle to a pint glass. Very cloudy caramel brown with a surprisingly thin head that didn't lace. Caramel, toffee, malt, and wood all evident in the nose. The taste featured all of these flavors and a thick body at first, which evolved to include a slight alcohol burn, and finished abruptly, with very little after-effect aside from a warm alcohol-feel. The lighter than expected finish certainly helps the sessionability of this beer (in spite of the alcohol content), but the body..thick at first, thin at finish...had me scratching my head. Going back to the store to grab another bottle of this to see how it ages, as I get sense that this one will smooth out over time nicely. Hopefully I'm right."
"D - Quite drinkable for the style and ABV. Good balance and a nice combination of flavors. I'm glad I picked this one up before it disappeared."
"This looks quite nice, a pretty ruby brown color with big tan head and mild turbidity. The smell is pretty nice too, big notes of clove and toffee. It goes down pretty easily, quite a light body. The clove note is similar to that of Duvel, actually, which surprised me. The taste is good, with toffee, brown sugar, cloves, and some bready malt, but there is a bit of a metallic taste there too, which is off-putting. All-in-all, this is a great brew that's worth trying. I'd reach for a Maudite first, however."
"This beer was quite fantastic in my opinion. Dark in color- nearly brown/purple with sligh head. Lots of dark fruits: plum, grapes and dry malt. The Russian River influence is quite apparent and appreciated. Mouthfeel is medium with good carbonation. Drinkability is great."
"Batch # 2, bottled February 2008. Deep, cloudy brown in my Affligem glass, the head is a scant motionless film although a thin ring is quite pronounced and did not diminish. Lots of suspended particles. Smell of raisins, prune tort. Taste reminds me of a rich Belgian strong dark ale, which might be overstating the obvious, but the flavour and texture seem right on the mark. Taste is sweet candied dark fruit, English toffee, sour dough bread notes, banana, bitterness comes through in the finish. Long aftertaste features candy apple, caramel, wafer, decomposing peach. There is a bit of citric acid but it hardly detracts from the overall presentation. Very rich, smooth, rewarding flavour profile, nice texture, bit of alcohol heat but overall smooth and tasty, try one if you get the opportunity."
"CNL is a well crfted, Belgain-styled beer brewed in America, collaboration or not. It's worth keeping your eyes peeled for."
"D. Easy to drink. I expected more flavor and complexity from the style."
"T: Overwhelming flavor! Warm brandy intensity upfront that carries through! Just...intense flavor. Tangy, puckery bitterness towards end. Overall, it has a thick, caramel and toffee sweetness."
"This brew is easy to drink, but I'm not sure if they get easier to drink. The first one is great. After that it might lose some luster, but That first one is so good it deserves a nice score."
"D- Drinks like an american barleywine, just overly not impressive. Only Unibroue and a true Belgian can pull of this style it seems."
"Drinkability: Goes down smooth. Pretty decent for the style. The snifter definitely brings out the aromas. Would drink again as it is an easy drink."
"Drinkability - Too sweet and filling to be sessionable. Much better in a sample size or being shared."
"Poured into a chalice, this beer was red-brown in color with a good bit of turbidity and little to no head. The appearance was, to me, unappealing reminding me of dirty water. Aroma was pleasing, consisting of a sweet fruitiness, honey, and alcohol. Taste largely follows the nose. Most prominent was the flavor of caramelized fruit; apricot, cherry, and overripe plum. Notes of honey were also present along with alcohol, ending with a dry finish. Overall, I found the flavor to be overly sweet and syrupy. Mouthfeel was smooth, of medium body and carbonation. While this is an interesting offering, due to the overt sweetness of this beer, I would not have more than one."
"Pours a dark orange red with fading two finger eggshell colored head, lots of sediment, thin sheet of lacing. Smell: sweet, caramel, clove, raisin, soft banana, somewhat muted. Taste: dark caramel, red plum, some raisin, a sweet bready thing going on, a touch of spicy hop to go with spicy clove note, and a bit of mashed up ready-for-banana-bread banana. Something else... can you hybrid pear and ginger? I'm not a huge fan of this style but this one was fairly interesting but unexciting. Cool story behind it though."
"D- not bad but the beer fills you up quick. Being a mixed brew i wasnt sure how to approach this but it was good overall. The overly sweetness of the beer takes the rating down a notch but good brew."
"I haven't tried either of the component ales so I can't really comment on the effectiveness of the combination. On its own merits though, it makes for a solid Belgian dark ale, perhaps lacking in complexity."
"Taste is all bananas upfront with raisins, plums and a little bit of breadiness on the mid palette, the finish is more bananas and a bit of heat as well. I am really underwhelmed to be honest. Its flavors are disjointed, and too weak, the heat is a big distraction, this beer is a mess. Given Russian river and Avery's track records i expected this collaboration to be better, but its mediocre at best."
"Hazy, light rust hues with little to no head except for the final pour from the bottle. There is very little carbonation visible but the debris present makes the difference. The malt overtones are exceptionally balanced with the hop finish and fruity undertones. The sweet candied hops and fruitiness is nice and made crisp with a nice floral/citrus hop finish. There is some chewy stickiness to this brew which is quite pleasant as the body stays even without too much thickness or syrup. The body of the brew reminds me of apple cider, and even more so as my pint sat and came up to room temperature. The rise in temp also increased the ease with which my pallet could detect a nice hop finish. This is a really good style interpretation and a testament to what two quality brewers can do when their not suing one another over copywrie issues."
"medium body, acidic mouthfeel, great carbonation. very good drinkability as well. a good beer, but not the best belgian dark. the story behind this makes this even better."
"D: I wasn't really sure what to expect from this, and must say it was a fairly pleasant experience."
"Final thoughts: THe beer starts good but seems to get that strange wild-saison-like taste that is pretty unpleasant after the Belgian tripel. I remember the last batch being better than this I think. I could see some people liking this one, but its not for me, its even hard to continue drinking it, the unpleasant finish makes me want to keep drinking it to get the good start that will go over the finish."
"Good one to try to see what all the hype is about. Not one I'll go back for though."
"Purchased from Consumer Beverage in Hales Corners, WI. Poured from the bottle into a snifter yielded a deep, dark orange body with a thin cap of foam. Aroma is mostly of yeasty esters with some hint of malt sweetness. Mouthfeel is full bodied and syrupy. Extremely malty and sweet. The alcohol is well hidden. This is a decent beer, but didn't win me over."
"Having heard the back story on this beer, I was quite curious to try it. I can't say that it wowed me, but it's an interesting combination of styles from two distinctive and excellent breweries. Ultimately, my opinion is simply that each brewery does a better job on their own than in collaboration. This beer pours a lighter than expected though still quite dark golden brown color. The aroma is of nectarines and earthy yeast. The flavor is quite fruity but doesn't pack enough depth for me to really enjoy it. The caramel malt character is good as is the blending of yeast flavors. The flavors just come out a bit too close to a bubblegummy weizenbock for my taste in Belgian ales. The feel is strong and drinkability is pretty good."
"D: Fairly sweet from the predominance of malts but not at all a noticeable correlative alcohol taste."
"I like this better than the version I tried last year. Last year's was too yeasty and unrefined, whereas this one seems to have a few flavors coming forward. The alcohol bite takes away from drinkability, but overall its fairly palatable."
"Easy to drink and I actually wish i would have grabbed a couple while they were on sale for 4.49 a 750. I could have more than one of these easy in a sitting"
"Odd, because the mouthfeel is really much thinner than it should be with makes the carbonation seem overactive (it's not). Strangely, this actually ups the drinkability by quite a bit. Like this beer so much more than I remember!"
"An interesting mix, not quite sure it works. I feel like the taste falls flat, not enough spiciness or fruitiness to cut through the heavy chocolate and dark malt feel. Too bad."
"Mouthfeel: Coats the tongue. Thicker feel but better carbonation would be nice."
"Mouthfeel/drinkability: Medium bodied with moderate carbonation. The alcohol is not as pronounced as I was expecting after having several other beers by Avery. Overall a good beer but nothing special or outstanding for the style."
"Garnet like color again with a bit more red than I expected and a near-white head that faded quickly and laced cleanly. Quite malty, spicy, and decent yeast on the nose. I'm not picking up any hops on the nose at all. The taste is about the same with some clove present and the missing hops. Good carbonation and body. The finish was ever-so-slightly harsh which makes it only average drinkable."
"The mouth is thickish which I liked. Not a session beer for me, but a very tasty treat."
"The mouthfeel is a bit thicker than I was expecting, but it really did a nice job of bringing everything together, very nice beer that drinks well."
"D- Not a session beer by any means, but a nice sipper. This is a very tasty beer from two great breweries, I love it! Recommended!"
"Pours a cloudy, dark maize color. Sediment is apparent. 1/3 inch head of an off-white color. Good retention and good lacing. Smells of coriander, pear, yeast, tart malt, alcohol, hops, slight pine, and sweet malt. Fits the style of a Belgian Strong Dark Ale. Mouth feel is smooth and slightly thick with an average carbonation level. Tastes of slight alcohol, coriander, yeast, tart malt, slight hops, and some pear. Overall, a stronger brew that isn't too tart, but well blended and good body. I highly recommend this brew."
"D: A little tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, good kick, good representation of style, I was expecting a little bit more out of this beer but it's still a solid Belgian to drink for a while."
"D: This was a good choice for review number 450. The high strength makes this a very fine nightcap beer. The piny hops seem a little outside of this style, but this is still a solid offering. I'm quite happy I picked this one up."
"Candidly, a half of the bottle was left overnight and was better the next day; sorry-that's the way it was but it tasted as stated and was nice. It was a bit more integrated and elegant the second day. Either way, just popping the cap and consuming or after some time....nice drink."
"Great mouthfeel, really love this beer. Excellent blending of both styles. Like in Ratt's Round and Round Video where the high class society is having dinner and Ratt is upstairs playing rock music. Classic beer."
"THANKS ADAM AND VINNIE !"
"Batch #3. Poured into a Westmalle glass maple brown with a thin off white head that dissipates quickly. No lacing. Smell has belgian yeast smell, and so does the taste. There's a slight hop bite up front that mellows into orange hints and then malted sweetness. The mouthfeel is a little high in carbonation for this style, which is suprising the way the head disappeared so fast. Overall, this is a nice ""mixed"" beer. I might buy another and let it age."
"Drinkability is good not something i would buy on regular basis but defiantly worth a try."
"Drinkability? For me, it's excellent. Tasty, smooth drinking, great mouthfeel and alcohol nonintrusive, that makes for a damn good session of a very nice Belgian Strong Dark Ale."
"Pours a hazy amber with a thick but rapidly dissipating head. A good whiff of banana, lemon zest and clove on the nose. Sweet malt definitely takes the lead with molasses and toffee flavors up front with a bit of citrus hanging out in the background. Sweetness generally stays on your tongue for a while, but it's rounded out nicely with a touch of hop bitterness and alcohol on the finish. Sweet enough to stand up to more briny shellfish (mussels / oysters) but would probably overwhelm lighter seafood. Definitely a collaboration worth trying. Going to take a crack at aging this and seeing what happens, but it tastes pretty darn good fresh."
"Medium-full body, moderate carbonation. Slightly thick, and chewy. Overall smooth, but certainly malt dominant. Alcohol warming is evident, but alcohol is otherwise hidden well. Enjoyable, but probably only good for one in a sitting."
"Over all it is a very good, highly drinkable beer. Fruity yeast and roasted malt are a very good combo. Recommend everyone to have it on their Wants list"
" This brew could probably stand to be cellared for a year, to let the alcohol and sugars calm down a bit. It is however, a decently drinkable beer in its current state."
"For its abv I would say this is a pretty drinkable brew. Not an exceptional beer but its worthy."
"Decent beer, but I'd leave blending to more sure things... like Shirley Temples. :P"
"D- This beer is a good beer but not what I am really looking for most of the time. I would pick this beer up again when I was in the mood for something different."
"pour is a dark amber with murk. a medium mild head. smell is simple wheat malt, and ethanol. banana and belgian sweetness. palate is that with a coarse hop character. a bit peppery. a bit of dark fruit in there but not something i can pick up on tap for some reason. had it better in a bottle... more balenced."
"Notes: Well it's a tasty brew overall and by all means for it's style as well. Cheers."
"D: Really good the style. Disguises the abv well."
"Pured a cloudy orangish body with solid two-finger head that left lace down the glass. Some light herbal hops and sweet caramel notes are in the smell, while I also pick up hints of that typical Belgian yeast/orange smell in here. Also some aromas of dark and tart fruits. They really nailed the aroma. Smooth and slightly sticky at the same time, there is a good yeast twang in this beer and a good amount of fruit tastes - citric with orange, heavier fruits like grapefruit (subtley, I should say). Mixed with a good batch of sugary sweet malts - caramel, gum - think sticky. Has an added touch of clove and a hidden ABV to make this dangerous. A great sipper to enjoy and a must-try."
"It makes for a good story...to think of Vinnie and guests sitting around Russian River with all the customers clamoring about (can't do that anymore), and trying to determine the name for this. Though its not my favorite from RR or Avery I would probably pass it along, just to be able to tell the story."
"pours a orange/copper. murky, too. absolutely no head, hair-line lacing. the first smell had a mix chocolate and cola, pretty good if you ask me. dark sugar yeast flavors. this is the easiest on the pallet of the three batches so far. This batch was brewed with a previously brewed batch of avery's slavation, a golden ale, which might be the reason this batch is so different. A great light brown ale, always a pleasure to find this beer. I've aged previous batches, wouldn't age this one."
"*Edit* As this brew warms the complexity really comes out, B+ to an A- for me. Will grab another #2 for sure."
"Drinkability: This guy's a sipper. The closest I'll get to tasting a Russian River beer here in South Carolina!"
"Pours reddish-brown with an orange tint. A decent sized tan head fades leaving some broken stripes of lacing behind. Aroma involves sour and tart dried, dark fruits (figs, prunes), yeast, faint alcohol and a subtle candy sweetness. Tastes of more dark fruits, matls, taffy and grain. A very faint alcohol heat slips in at the very end. If the taste was as bold as the smell, we'd have an exceptional beer here, but it's a bit understated for a beer of this magnitude. Mouth-feel is medium plus. It's well carbonated. This is a really good beer, but just a little tweaking on the taste would make it near perfect, so here's hoping to Avery and RR getting together again and create another fine brew for us."
"Good."
"Pours a nice looking bright amber orange. Decent two finger head that fades quick. I like the hazy glow of the beer. The smell isn't the best. Pretty standard light malt sweetness, pepper notes, not much interesting scents. The beer does taste pretty good though. The only thing that I don't like is that it tastes more like a saison. The carbonation is light and refreshing very enjoyable. And the brew is really drinkable, nice alcohol warming. It won't put you to bed though."
""
"D: Highly drinkable for the style and abv. Perhaps too much for an extended sitting, but something I'm glad I can get in bottle form back here in Chicago."
"Pours hazy bright orange. Slight head but fabulous lacing. Aroma is assertive and plummy, marmalade like. Flavor is sweet and slightly spicy, with an apricot character, a hint of orange marmalade. Spicy, phenolic, slight Belgiany. Finish is spicy, allspice, carbonation. Mouthfeel is smooth but spritzy. Refreshing and drinkable. Not sure of the point, though."
"Batch #3. Pours a dark, murky amber with a large white head. The foam disappears to nothing quickly, but leaves a lot of lacing. Strong aromas of banana, apple, clove, tangy yeast are present, along with a general sugary sweetness. Tastes quite spicy and fruity initially, with a strong, slightly toasty caramel malt character to back it up. Hop bitterness is there in the background, but acts to balance out the sweet components pretty nicely. Though the finish is slightly warming, it's not boozy. This is not normally my style of beer; I find them to be big sugary messes, in general. Avery's normal Salvation was terrible. This brew, however, was a pleasant surprise that worked well."
"D- Interesting brew. I enjoyed this one but just don't think I could drink a lot of these or drink them often. Kind of a change of pace beer for me."
"d: I wouldn't want to drink too much of this because it's very strong flavored, but the one goblet was just enough."
"Bottom Line: Buy this beer and try it. An awesome collaboration from 2 awesome breweries. I'm excited to see more from these guys!"
"Good full mouthfeel and an easy drinking beer for the style. Abv not noticable."
"Smell from bottle is a smoky flavor. A dark, golden color with a little fizz rising to the top. Smell in a pint glass is also smoky. Nice, mellow taste with a very slight candy flavor. ABV doesn't overwhelm the drinkability of this beer. Little sediments floating in glass as I pour the rest of the beer in it. A decent beer to try at least once."
"Overall, not bad, but not good."
"Initial sweetness is tempered by a nutty-flavor, hopped to balance without being overly bitter. A bit of spiciness, maybe clove. Mouthfeel is a little overly medicinal, but the carbonation is right on target. The hoppy nuttiness is what lingers, the malt is soon forgotten. Medium in body, fairly easy to drink if you can adapt to it. I wasn't a big fan of Avery's Salvation, and this one seems to pack a little more flavor and variety in. I think it would do better being a little sweeter, but the nuttiness adds a new dimension to it. Not quite true to Belgian style, but still interesting to try nevertheless. This one is probably one and done for me."
"D-First you have to like this style of beer. If your not a fan or at least tolerant of the style, you wont like this. A lot of beers get dinged in this category and this is no exception. I can't get over the alcohol aftertaste. I personally like Avery's Salvation better than this. It's good, but I'm not wowed by this."
"D: This was an interesting study in beer combinations, and I enjoyed the exercise. However, if you put your mind at ease and just sip it, it can be quite pleasant and refreshing. Although my wife couldn't even finish 1 glass..."
"fans of the salvation will like this one. the label is great the smell is average nice beer smell taste is a nice mixture of dark and light flavors the mouthfeel and drinkability are pretty good. i had it in the 22 oz bottle and it was nice. fans of avery beers or limited release beers should definately give this one a try."
"Batch #3. This poured a hazy amber color with light tan head. It smelled like wild Belgian yeast and salt, with some lemon and soy and a bit of orange and caramel. It tasted like salty lemons and sour orange zest and wild Belgian yeast, with a bit of cream and caramel. Sweet caramel became more apparent as it warmed. It was watery with moderate carbonation, with a smooth tart aftertaste. Overall this was a very sour beer, but it was very clean and well constructed. Definitely more of a Belgian light or tripel than Belgian dark or dubbel, the flavors just never reached that delicious level that I was hoping for. But it had good body and hid the alcohol well. The big flavors made this more of a sipping beer, but not really in a bad way. I expected a lot of good things from this beer, and although it was enjoyable, I was somewhat let down."
"The mouthfeel slips a little from the excellence of the taste due to a sugary coating left in my mouth. It's not horrible but a little on the sweet side for my taste. Other aspects are near perfect like the moderate carbonation that accentuates the spices. Kick ass beer well worth trying."
"M - A little thinner than medium bodied, fair carbonation."
"Notes: While this is a good, solid brew that drank easily, I expected a little more from this collaboration of two great brewers. The nose is kind of underwhelming, the flavors are good, but the mouthfeel just felt a little off. Didn't strike me as an authentic Belgian-feeling ale should. Still definitely worth a try if you like BSDA's."
"I haven't had the pleasure of a Russian River brew but I've been happy with my experiences with Avery. Unfortunately this doesn't follow that trend. Nothing about this brew stands out to me except the high ABV. It's not one I'd get again."
"Others have said it - this beer just seems a little bit muddled. Every characteristic seems relegated to such bit parts that they are largely overwhelmed by the spice and alcohol notes."
"Sure I can drink this all night, but would would be the point really. I can drink cheaper and get a buzz or I can spend as much as get something amazing, delicious and interesting."
"Another good American/Belgian, easy to drink, great body, enjoyable, but not outstanding."
"The Closest I can get to a Russian River for now and I loved it, i would have another if I would of bought two."
"D: Not being the biggest fan of RR Salvation, I didn't know what to expect. Avery's beer is excellent, but in the end the combo fell short for me. I can drink it, but it's too expensive to buy again."
"RR Salvation is one great beer, Avery's Salvation is a pretty good BSPA. Though the combination is a little less than what I was expecting. I enjoy this, but not something I am going to get often."
"1 pint and 6 ounce bottle poured into a Chimay chalice. Label reads batch # 3 with a bottled date of February 2009. After the pour, a very small head forms initially and disappears in less than a minute. Little bit of lacing appears as you drink it down but it doesn't really hold on the glass. Beer has a nice light brownish orange color. Thought it was interesting that the color of the beer pictured on the label looked nothing like the actual beer. Smell is yeasty with some citrus and flowery notes. Taste is very, very smooth. Yeasty bread taste dominates and reminds me of a strain of yeast that is common with many belgian brews (not sure what it is though). Beer is well balanced, the hops come through at the forefront and methodically creep away as you make your way to the somewhat dry finish. The hop bite initally appears to be strong but is restrained just enough to make this superbly well balanced. The smooth mouthfeel and well balanced taste make it a beer that you can enjoy again and again. Was hoping for a bit more in this ""collaboration"" given the quality of many of these brewers' standalone beers but all in all, a solid beer that I would enjoy again. Haven't enjoyed the two Salvation beers from Avery and Russian River but would be curious to see how they compare to this one."
"Drinkability: A solid more-so BSPA, which it seems to be more than the BSDA. I'm a huge fan of both breweries, and though I can't comment on each single, I'm a fan of this and like what they're doing with the collaboration."
"Overall: Interesting concept. It has been a while since I tried Avery's Salvation and I've never tried Russian River's. I'd be interested to compare this against each individually, but as a blend it DOES work, though not without its flaws."
"Quite an unusual beer, but after getting used to it, the flavors blend surprisingly well. A worthwhile experience."
"Very drinkable Belgian ale, nice result of a team effort from two stellar breweries. very enjoable and left me wanting more."
"22oz bomber - batch no. 2 feb 2008 - good tasty stuff here - pours cloudy - smells malty - taste is pretty well balanced - goes down easy - interesting story if you can read the #1 font size type on the label - these guys should get together more often."
"Orangish color with a tan head. The nose has candy malts and spicy Belgian yeasts. Taste is also sweet with fruits and rich malts but well balanced by the herbal yeast presence. Medium body a bit over carbonated. Nice brew from these two guys, but seems to be more on the Avery side."
"Very good beer with a nice assortment of belgian and hefe type flavors. I really enjoyed this one."
"M/D - decent mouthfeel and carbonation, very good tasting with the spices and malts, it maybe be a bit much for more than just one glass though for me."
"I wish they would make this a year-round offering. It is very tasty and easy to drink. The almost 9%ABV is very well hidden."
"Drinkability: A fairly tasty and enjoyable beer made from one good beer, one so-so beer, one sweet story, and one dopey name."
"D- one bomber was plenty, if not a little too much. A great bargain brew, just not something I would find myself craving that often."
"Overall- This is a pretty good beer the aroma is fantastic but he flavor is a little light, I would like a little more in this area."
"This is a smooth complex standout beer"
"Taste is a Belgian yeast explosion! Brilliant use of bittering and flavoring hops to provide a clean finish to this wonderful concoction. I also get a bit of sugar-toasty sweetness in here. A top notch beer. While the Avery Salvation is good, this beer is great. Makes me want some Russian River stuff even more now."
"D) While it went down smooth, I'm not craving another bottle. I wouldn't turn one down though."
"Not too much head on this one and real syrupy look to it, same in the smell and, to some degree, the taste. This one improved for me as it warmed up; took almost 1.5hrs to finish the bottle. Left feeling heavy, a little sweeter than I favor, but a steal at $2.99 - thanks to the sam's beermart in durham, a great deal on a respectable brew."
"Batch #2. Pours a murky reddish-brown with a large off-white head that has very good retention. Large amount of sticky lacing is left on the glass. The aroma is rich consisting of dark fruit such as figs, dates, and raisins. A touch of cherry as well as alcohol is also detected. The flavor does not follow up with the big flavors. It is still quite good with a sweet, brown sugar flavor. A definate cherry finish. Alcohol is very well hidden. Just seems like this is missing something that would make it truely exceptional. The body is big but lacks a good texture. Maybe a bit overcarbonated."
"D: This beer was easy to drink and I would certainly enjoy another. However, the moderately high alcohol content could make functioning a little difficult."
"try for yourself and see."
"Overall impression: Very complex and interesting beer. I had this one fresh on tap, and I think its drinking better now than it did then. Nice to see 2 great brewers teaming up."
"D-Very enjoyable...pretty complex and well worth trying. Quality collaboration."
"I am more of a Belgian Pale than Belgian dark fan, but I can really appreciate the flavors going on in this beer. There's a good bit of caramel maltiness in there, but it is balanced well with everything else going on to keep it from being too sweet. Collaboration Not Litigation is a great beer worth trying. Here's to Double Salvation! Double the salvation, double the fun!"
"Drinkability: This is highly drinkable, even at 8.72% the alcohol is burried beneath the creamy malts. Very smooth! I'm not sure how it compares to the 1st batch, but if #1 was this good, then let's keep funding those ""educational"" trips to Belgium."
"A huge beer. Mahogany pour with a thick off-white head. Dense aroma of yeast, malt, bubblegum, spice, and a good kind of funkiness. Viscous, oily mouthfeel. More bubblegum and malt in the flavor, with some molassess, spice, and eartiness. A little alcohol at the end. This one is really good."
"3.5/5"
"Pours a very dark amber color with a thick foamy white head. Aroma consists of dark fruit, spices and a nice malt presence. Very quaffable with a lot of maltiness, dark fruit (plum, raisin, fig, date, etc.)and spice. Nice combination of swet dark fruit, maltiness, spice and sweet alcohol. Very good."
"The aroma has spices like coriander and anise with yeast, herbs, and bread dough. The appearance is hazy amber with a two finger head. The flavor is like the aroma but with more bitterness and alcohol than was detected at first. The palate is smooth with a spicy, peppery aftertaste. Overall it's a nice collaboration."
"22 0z bottle batch 2 bottled 2/08 poured a murky dark amber color with a thin light tan head . aroma has sweet over ripe dark fruit, light yeast, chewy underlying malt, and candy sugar sweetness. mouth feel is a solid medium with low carbonation. flavor has loads of dark ripe fruit, rich complementing malt, high sweetness, and slightly funked fruited yeast. fairly hefty and rich but comes off smooth and well balanced."
"Notes from 3/18/07"
"D - If I had to, I could drink a couple of these. It's a bit cloying, so I don't know that I would want to. Not bad."
"Pours a large head, yellow-white, big bubbles, somewhat lasting. Cloudy brown color, fizzy. Belgian hop aroma, sweet, floral, inhaling deeply brings out more dry hops, but still sweet. Floral, some malty taste, dry sweet taste typical of belgian beers. Letting warm up a bit...Waming up takes away some flavor, leaves the floral sweetness. A little too sweet."
"D- Very drinkable, for a strong (abv) beer. Goes down smooth!!!"
"Smooth, creamy, light effervescence with a medium-full body. Quite good but a littleweak on the complexity. The least of the many Avery brews I've had, but still a good beer."
"I haven't had the RR Salvation, and I didn't enjoy the Avery - a bit too boozy and overly hopped for the stated style. This is a solid ale, without a good style. Keep an open mind and you should enjoy this one."
"Quite an interesting concept behind this beer as it's always good to hear two brilliant minds in the business, joining forces. Unfortunately, this offering doesn't meet the expectations I have for such a collaboration. A decent Belgian-style brew, but nothing spectacular."
"D: Amazing for 9%, an easy drinker."
"D - Was not expecting this to be a bev that would require a second opinion. I want and need to get my hands on some Russian River stuff cause Avery kills it with many a brew and this combo will definitely be added to the repeat drinking lets get fucked up on any given night list."
"Pours a caramel color, appearance somewhat like apple cider. Not much head to speak of. The aroma has hints of fruits in it along with a yeasty undertone. You get more of that yeast in the flavor, along with the familiar fruit/spice combination of belgian ales. There is a nice hoppy bite to the mouthfeel, and a warming alcohol residue. This is definitely an interesting offering from the guys at Avery and RR, it may have just been my bottle but the yeast really showed up in this which i'm not a huge fan of. Def worth a try for belgian strong ale fans though."
"Nice combo of 2 brews I don't visit often. Will be fun to sample all 3 side by side."
"This beer was a hazy light amber color with some residual head. The aroma had figs, raisins, and some alcohol present, along with some typical Belgian characteristics. It's a little thin on the palate and has quite a bit of carbonation. It finishes solid, but overall, did not live up to its billing."
"D: Not highly drinkable, i'd like to drink another, but i feel one is more than enough. Great beer all around, but not exactly something i'd reach for every afternoon."
"Beautiful orange/amber pour, nice clarity and a great looking foamy white head. Smells of caramel malt and dark fruits. Taste is malty and sweet, again with the dark fruits, and a lingering trace of alcohol warmth. Pleasant, creamy mouthfeel. Quite good. I'd definitely drink this again (this is far from my first) but one per sitting is satisfying enough."
"This one is very reminiscent of Matilda from Goose Island. Perhaps that is not appropriate to compare as it probably matters which I had first. But, in direct comparison, for my money I would probably go with the GI offering. That is not an indictment of this beer, but rather a value statement. CNL Ale is a great one for the special occasion."
"Overall, a great drinking Belgian dark, which is not always the case."
"Great session beer. Would stick to one bottle per sitting."
"Pours a slightly cloudy dark amber with a restrained off white head that laced the glass. Aroma is heavy on the caramel malt and spicy, floral hops, but there is some clove, banana, and phenols hiding in the background. Taste is excellent! Kind of like and IPA mixed with a Belgian strong ale. You get all the goodness of the caramel malt and hops with a restrained Belgian yeast feel to it. Great brew, wish I had more bottles."
"The beer suffers just a tiny bit in the mouthfeel department and needs a bit thicker malting in order to work. I may try this again in the future or see how it ages."
"D: This beer is decent. It could be a hell of a lot better. I can see where they were headed. It has its high points and low. It is easy to drink making it nice. The nose and the taste could be much better. Still, not bad and I would have another."
"I love the concept here and wish more brewers would consider collaboration projects. It would be great to have the opportunity to try both salvations individually and then try the collaboration to see how the three compare."
"Drinkability would be medium to high for me. If my palate develops a taste for these Brett beers, I'm sure it would be much higher. But a good beer all around, I've nothing bad to say about it."
"mouthfeel is creamy, heavy, delicious, sour, smoothly blended goodness - very nice!"
"Pretty good drinkability. Very enjoyable and one I would like to get a hold of again."
"D: This beer is easy to drink. It is complex, but well balanced at the same time."
"D: Up there as far as abv% goes, but it's both pretty tasty and pretty interesting - recommended."
"I truly enjoyed this beer. Russian River is not yet avaliable in NY.so Ive only tried the Avery,but this was that beer and and more, so collaborate!!"
"It's an interesting beer, though not quite what I was expecting. It's a well done beer, but I don't think it agreed with what my tasters were expecting from it. Worth a try for sure, and I will have to try it again another time."
"Pours a semi-transparent, dark, golden amber with a very thick, fine-bubbled, cream-white head that sticks around a while. Aroma is rich and malty with fruity and yeasty hints. Mouth-filling flavor is very toothsome, mostly malty with some hints of hops and undertones of bananas. Texture is pleasantly smooth, but this beer still goes down with just a little sass."
"D - I liked this beer a lot its a good Belgain style beer that I enjoyed sipping on worth a try sometime"
"D - This is such an interesting concept and it works quite well."
"Sadly I've never tried each of these two on their own, but I'ave had Avery Salvation. This brew was late years better than that brew, anyways appears a murky mahogany amer ruby hued slightly clouded cider like tone as you pour more sediment into the glass. Head forms thick brown nice and smooth velvet texture fine bubbles form nice lacing around the chalice after each sip. Aromatics bring heavy spices with apple cider and raisin complexities. Matched with lactic notes of wild yogurt and thick yeast infused bread notes rolling on. Flavor is refrehsingly tart and creamy with more signature yougurt and lactic notes, pepery and citrus with raisin and caramel sweetness. Solid fruity healhty balance from all aspects more mild spice flavor comes through as it warms, Mouthfeel is a full medium body with even carbonation that comes across the palate with a soft and smooth presence. Drinkability was excellent really effortless to share this with my BA buddy jcdiflorio awhile back, can't wait to try any Russian River brews. By the way thanks to SurlyDuff for this fine offering."
"Not the most drinkable Beer. I liked the idea, not so much the execution."
"D: Excellent. Went down amazingly well for an almost-9% ale."
"M + D: Zippy carbonation, a little stickiness, and a touch of alcohol finish. A gentle sipper... not a favourite, perhaps, but a decent ale, nonetheless."
"This beer is pretty tasty, definitely worth a try."
"D: This is a very nice belgian ale. a nice Collaberation between Russian River and Avery. probably the closest I'll ever get to trying any Russian River beers. very nice"
"Drinkability is fairly high. Good flavor, and alcohol is well hidden."
"D: Pretty drinkable especially for a beer of this gravity. Interesting mix of flavors really is an intriguing beer. Definately worth a try. I also like the story behind the beer's name."
"22oz. bomber: This one pours a darker orangish/amber color. There was a full tan head on it when first poured, but it drops off to a thin ring rather quickly. The aroma was a bit lighter than I would have expected for a beer of this style. Still, it was good, with notes of caramel, breadiness, yeast and spices. The taste is good. The sweetness is more subdued than I would normally expect with a brew of this type. Caramel and fruit tastes, but they are subdued. Nothing really pops out, just a good blend. A bit of dryness to the finish. Nice."
"D - Went down very easy for me, thanks to the mouthfeel. Pretty much all there is to say here...a very drinkable beer for the style. Only drawback is the high abv."
"This was a great idea to blend the two brews. Ill need to try the two originals and then compare"
"D: Actually quite drinkable for a big Belgian-style beer. The well-balanced flavor makes it quite enjoyable and easy to drink. I could blow through a couple of bombers of this stuff and put myself in some real trouble."
"Na Zdravje!"
"D- A nice beer to sit and take your time and enjoy."
"Drinkability is moderate, initially pleasing flavor profile quickly fades from the palate leaving very little to linger, alcohol and carbonation are both on the verge of being distracting, expected more bold flavor for this style"
"Having said all that, my original 2.80 rating was a bit harsh in retrospect so I bumped most of the scores up a notch."
"Mouthfeel is a bit creamy with a nice smoothness."
"D - More please. Interesting beer, Vinny and Adam fight a death match with collaboration."
"The beer poured a slightly hazy honey-amber with a thick, white head into a chalice. The smell was the classic bubble-gum Belgian yeast profile - very nice. The taste was more of the bubble-gum Belgian yeast profile, with hints of candy sugar and a significant hop bite - very tasty. The carbonation and lacing was excellent, with a smooth, lingering, alcoholic finish. A very drinkable strong Belgian ale and another great offering from Avery."
"OVerall: This is a very interesting beer, a lot going on in here although I would be hard pressed to finish a big bottle, i could barely even get down the little snifter. Certainly worth trying for the uniqueness."
"Highly recommended."
"The spiciness really does not bother you much. A very well done belgian, and easy sipper. No problems getting through this 22."
"Light-medium-bodied and well-carbonated, this is a nicely drinkable beer."
"D: This is decent, but didn't really live up to my hopes for it. There's nothing I really dislike about it, aside from it being somewhat watery, but there's really nothing out of the ordinary about it either. I guess I would have to say its impressive that they were able to take two different beers, combine them, and still have it taste pretty good...but I was hoping for something a little more interesting."
"Rich and full mouthfeel. Fairly drinkable, but a bit overly yeasty and phenolic for my own tastes."
"Poured into a goblet, it is a clear, brown/caramel color with a thick head that quickly thins out into a thin layer of bubbles, there is very little lacing and some good carbonation going on. There are some good sweet aromas like sugar, apples and a little bit of cinnamon; some faint hops and a little yeast and a slight alcohol smell. It feels slightly crisp, dry over all with a slight bitter aftertaste that's mixed in with some alcohol; you can taste the malts in it... it really warms up your mouth. It has a medium body that's more on the light side of things. It picks up a slightly sweeter taste as it warms up, not bad overall..."
"D - One is enough at this setting."
"Definitely yeasty taste with some banana that gives way to a subtle sweet and toasty malt flavor. Hops and carbonation kept the flavors in check. I could go for this brew every now and then, but no more than once in a sitting."
"I certainly couldn't drink this regularly. I wish it were a little more complicated."
"D - Killer. This is a very high quality brew that I would enjoy sipping all night. Couldn't really session this one at such a high ABV, and it could be dangerous since the alcohol is not apparent in the least. I would not have guessed that this was over 6% when drinking it!"
"Overall, this is a nice Belgian-style ale, not quite a strong dark ale, but nice and interesting nevertheless. I consider it well worth trying, but I don't particularly feel the need for a 2nd try at it..."
"Note: I am a homebrewer, and I notice that I get a different feeling when I get drunk off homebrew as opposed to commercial examples. With this beer, it felt like homebrew. I dug it."
"D: One glass is enough, the ale is a great digestif or before-bedif (if such a thing exists)."
"T/M/D - Subtle caramel flavor up front with a slightly chewy malty structure. Sense of cloves in the middle, spicy in that sense, maybe cinnamon. Finishes well, slightly warming, yet I was not aware of its ABV when consumed, and it surprised me. Quite drinkable in that sense, to a point."
"D: This one is too drinkable for its own good. I could knock this one back easily bottle after bottle. There is a bit of alcohol warmth, but the rest makes you want to come back early and often."
"Great beer had it on tap tonight at tjeverydays in Paoli PA. Terrific flavor, nice dark color out of the tap, little or no head, almost an oak taste. You would hard pressed to guess it was 9%. I was with 5 other people who all tried it and they agreed a terrific beer."
"D- if it weren't 8.99% abv this would be all that I drink for the next week. A very interesting Belgian. A mix of an Avery and a Russian River beer of the same name."
"Though I haven't had Salvation from either brewery, I find this to be very enjoyable (but at nearly $10, also expensive). Definitely worth a try - especially since it supports a good cause and may encourage further collaboration! (They say the profits go toward a trip to Belgium for the guys from Avery, Russian River, Port, Dogfish, and Allagash)"
"D - Merely good. The sweetness is just shy of cloying and that prevents me from scoring it higher. I could easily kill a bomber but wouldn't open a second."
"Pours a reddish brown color. Aroma is fruity and yeasty, also a bit spicy. Taste sort of sweet and sour. Lots of candied sugar combined with a cherry like tartness. Very musty like yeast flavor here. Mouthfeel is medium. This beer doesn't really do anything for me."
"D- a good beer, really enjoyed it, but should prolly age a little to let the maltiness smooth out, still seems a little too fresh"
"This beer is not all that strong, or dark, but nonetheless it is a worthwhile effort. Unfortunately having never tried a Russian River beer, I cannot say whether or how well it takes on the characteristics of their beers."
"Very very drinkable for the abv.... quite a dangerous brew. Avery has really outdone themselves with this one. Congrats to a brewery which has impressed me more and more in recent years."
"D- Sweet and malty with warming and noticable alcohol tastes take away a little from the drinkabilty factor."
"A typical dark Belgian ale, nothing to set it apart except a little more sweetness than usual. Worth trying for lovers of the style."
"Undistinguished for this style though. Lacks complexity."
"Surprising this one's called a dark. More likely it's a medium. Nice deep amber color with a couple fingers of white head on top that leaves okay lacing. Nose is strong on spices, citrus, wheat, and some light caramel. Taste is similar, with a nice batch of alcohol tossed in, along with some dried fruit. Feel is better than average, fairly thick and tasty. Overall, this one's a solid beer, although nothing too out of control."
"In terms of an archetypal Belgian strong ale this nails it very well. Dark walnut amber with modest head, nose of baking spices and aromatics, malt, fruit, dried apricots, apples, chewy and sippable; I preferred it as it warmed up. The sweetness and fruitiness become better resolved and clarified as the chill dissipates."
"Batch 2, 22oz bottle served in a chalice. Poured a hazy amber/gold with a thin off white head. Clove spiciness and some burnt sugar in the aroma. Medium bodied with some malt sweetness. Nice spicy flavor, a slight mustiness in the finish. A slight hop bitterness. Very drinkable and enjoyable to me. Nothing mind blowing however."
"Batch #2, bottled Feb08. An amber color with a medium sized white head. Nice aroma of banana and bread. I tasted bananas pretty much all the way through, but got a tinge of perfume at the end. Not unpleasant, just a bit surprising. I thought this was a pretty enjoyable beer."
"d: Great concept, good beer. I loved RR's Salvation, now I just need to try Avery's for comparison purposes."
"Drinkability: This is a very interesting Belgian dark ale, though I must say, it's not as interesting as I had hoped/expected. Still very good, and I'm pretty thrilled to have found a bottle - in Japan, no less!"
"Very drinkable despite the high alcohol content."
"D: overall a very enjoyable beer. I picked up this beer not knowing what to expect, and my second experience with an Avery beer is very favorable. Not as delicate as a Trappist-style strong ale, I detect more bitterness in this version, which puts a nice touch and differentiation on this. Well worth trying."
"Very drinkable considering the alcohol and quite enjoyable."
"Pours a rubbish amber hue with very thin sediment hanging amidst this rusty amber beer. No head and very light bubbling. Great color, but not the look I as expecting from a Belgian. Very caramely fruit, and a little spicey alcohol in the nose. Light maraschino cherries, caramel coriander, and walnuts. The palate is slightly sweet and syrupy. Very warm, but not not very smooth or soothing."
"Low carbonation, a bit syrupy. Very yeasty in the aroma and taste. Sweetness coats my entire mouth. I felt like there was something lacking in this strong dark Belgian ale. When the alcohol did make an appearance after the beer warmed a it, it was sort of an off-putting flavor. I'm glad I tried this beer, but I probably wouldn't go out of my way for it again."
"An interesting brew that is well worth a try. Although not quite what I would expect for the style. Overall a sweet, but rather mild brew."
"T: Medium bodied, creamy, adequate carbonation, slightly watery finish. Taste follows the nose, slightly cloying, lots of sweet, spicy maltiness with a little caramel. Slight taste of alcohol, but no burn. Not best of this style, but very nice. Liked this better than RR's Salvation."
"Pours a hazy light coppery brown into a chalice, with little head to speak of. Nose is fruity and flowery, with caramel and Belgian yeast. Taste is sweet, fruity, and caramelly, but balanced with a bitter bite at the end. Its a fairly heavy brew, but creamy at the same time. Enjoyable, but I probably won't go out of my way to find it."
"Were it not for the high ABV, this would veer on the verge of being a quaffer. A dangerous combination--creamy, smooth, flavorful, and potent. Highly recommended."
"I am liking the dark. Good job Avery. Pours a cloud covered dark amber. Smells of yeast, banana, cherries,hint of clove. Tastes dancing on the tongue, bready with a hint of banana and clove, maybe some orange peel. Refreshing and well balanced. Easy drinking. I enjoyed it in a bubble glass."
"The body is closer to mid but has some fuller aspects. Overall this is a fun beer but best to age. After some time I will have to revisit this beer."
"D - I am going to get a second bottle and age it to see what happens to the alcohol presence. This isn't a session beer but it is a darn good beer."
"Drinkability> Great for one or two, but I'd be ruined if I had more than that... I certainly wouldn't be able to pronounce the full name of the beer if I did."
"D - A nice crafted beer that may be past its prime. Alcohol is very well hidden amongst the complexities. A great collaboration between two top notch breweries. - 4"
"D- take this one slow as its intended to be. This is a good one to split."
"D: Super easy drinking. I would love to have this one tap. Hopefully Mahar's will get it. Wonderful blend from two good breweries."
"Drinkability- A deceptive Belgian styled ale that isn't quite as warming as it should be. A good rainy-day drinker (as it is here today at Boston's)"
"I would definitely give either of the original Salvations a try (I haven't had them before), but the mixture, while good, is not spectacular."
"Overall this stuff is pretty good, but I was expecting a little more. Oh well."
"Pours a rich golden amber with a creamy beige head. A malty faint belgian yeast character and wheaty, caramel in the nose as well. Taste is creamy, smooth and simple with brown malt and yeast flavors. On the lightly sweeter side. Softly carbonated and medium bodied. Drinkable."
"D: It hides its ABV fairly well and with less carbonation than expected from a Belgian, it's pretty drinkable."
"D: Definitely worth a try. very nice."
"Has this beer really been retired???"
"I think this is not only a good beer, but a good idea that I hope to see other brewers doing in the future. I will have to pick up a few more bottles before they are all sold out. Overall a must try."
"This beer is a true testament as to why the craft beer culture and industry is like no other...everyone should experience this brew."
"At the aforementioned abv drinkability is a relative term. It encourages frequent trips to the glass with its hidden alcohol. Beware though it does show up. Having said that it lends itself wonderfully to a night of session sipping after the first bottle."
"The aroma is caramel maltiness. It is a spicy brew to say the least. It tastes a soft spicy that stays with you the whole drink. The alcohol is pretty well hidden and not noticeable. It had a 8.99 ABV call on the bottle. It is a mostly malty ale with some faint phenols. I found it to be a wonderful beer. Maybe they can collaborate again someday."
"The flavor in this one will take you for a ride, and the mouthfeel is almost perfect as well. Let's get this oak-aged and served out of the cask!"
"Pretty tasty. Rounded out nicely when it warmed to room temperature. Deeper layers of flavors blossomed as I neared the end. Quite enjoyable."
"Tastes of warming alcohol, fruits, more sweetness from the malts and hop bitterness."
"M/D: Medium to full bodied, carbonation is medium, alcohol is hidden. Drinkability is pretty good. I was expecting a much ""bigger"" beer. Not that this isn't big, it's just that it exhibits a lot of character found more in lighter beers. A really good offering."
"D: Very solid beer. A good balance between malty sweetness and a tart and tangy Belgian. A very drinkable beer that I will definitely drink again."
"Drinkability: Heck yeah.... go out and get some of this... Batch #2 is now in wide circulation!"
"This one's good for some snifterin' and sippin'"
"Drinkability is good, as this goes down very effortless. However, I recall a bit more depth in the first batch, which I ultimately preferred. Not sure if the difference was the bottle conditioning vs. draught, a recipe change, or just a hazy memory. Either way, a good BSDA."
"A moderate amount of carbonation stayed in the body, but despite that, it was thick and velvety with a little bit of warmth going on. This stuff is a lot of fun to drink."
"D- If you enjoy this style, you will most likely enjoy this this one, as well as the story. I do enjoy this style and this beer. I hope to try the 3 of them in a blind tasting."
"D - this is a really enjoyable beer, but I don't know that I could do more than a glass due to the strength. Still, what a great a story behind it, and it was quite enjoyable!"
"Poured this one into a tulip glass. The liquid was a bright orange/red color. There was a small two finger head which lingered throughout the glass, never going away. Smell was spicy and yeasty with a hint of fruit (maybe apricot?) The flavor was peppery, extremely spicy (cloves, cardamom?), fruity- grapes, apricot, peach, raison, prune. Mouthfeel was clean and fresh. I was getting some burning towards the end, but not much detection of the alcohol. I thought this beer was so well done. Great interpretation of the style and an easy drinker."
"Drinkability is overall very nice. ABV prohibits drinking a lot, but the taste is very pleasant."
"d: High drinkability. I wish I had tried both Salvation prior to collaboration for a better sense of perspective. I will say that the end result is a great flavor."
"Overall, a decent Belgian style."
"Pours a three finger off-white head that fades slowly to a thin layer leaving some lace. Cloudy amber color. Good carbonation and medium bodied. Raisin/caramel nose. Flavor is almost sweet to start, hints of yeast and caramel, clean finish. Warming. $7.05 for a 22oz bottle from John's Marketplace Portland, OR."
"DRNK - 3.5"
"D - Will drink anytime I get the chance to. Thanks to Drdogbeer and if any one wants to trade let me know!"
"Bummer."
"Cheers"
"I have not tried either Salvation, which I now look forward to do side by side to see where each of the two is adding it's characteristics."
"A perfectly nice belgian dark ale. I was certainly expecting something that would knock my socks off given the brewers involved. Still nice to be able to give it a try though."
"Special thanks to Kyle from Gary's in Madison for this one... From what I understand, this beer got its name because both Avery Brewing Co. and Russian River both had beers named ""Salvation", so they decided to combine their two beers into this one special brew... The result is a very unique, rich, thick, example of an outstanding beer... Pours a purple, dark, ruby-red hue with minimal frothy head that soon dissipated... Smell was very sweet and rich, with obvious prune, figs, and caramel notes pouring through... Taste strongly complements the aroma, with rich brown sugar, malts, and a distincly sweet honey taste... the dark, dehydrated fruit flavor is really present, and makes itself very well known in this particular brew... overall, the taste was top-notch, a real stand-out... mouthfeel was ultra-rich and creamy and really enjoyable... drinkability was equally very good, and the hefty 8.99% ABV struggles to make itself known behind a wonderful cornucopia of thick and sweet flavors... Definitely recommended..."
"Russian River Salvation: 4.5, 4.0, 4.0, 4.0, 4.0... ... 4.05"
"D: I love good belgians, i'll drink them all night. This one is no exception."
"D:Good. If not familiar with Belgium beers, this would be a great introduction."
"I remember a lot of buzz about this beer when it first came out. I like it, but Im not overly wowed by it either. Maybe Id simply heard too much about it beforehand and my expectations were too high. Its a good beer, Id buy it again, but I think Ill try some other beers first before I go back to this one."
"22 oz. glass bottle- color of reddish brown, with a thick tan head - nose of prunes, brown sugar, dates, and slight alcohol  taste of tannins, brown sugar, molasses, earth, alcohol, and port - body is medium, and with low carbonation  aftertaste of molasses, vegetation, and port"
"Overall this is a very interesting beer indeed. I personally feel like I can really tell that there are fighting sides going on here. Perhaps it is my past experience with Salvation by RR. I guess it's all conjecture really. Overall, I think this is a very interesting beer. Definitely one worth trying. I should have tried it a long time ago."
"Pours a murky dark amber color with small floaties (more than traditional sediment) throughout the glass. The aroma and flavor are a surprisingly simple Belgian spice - very mellow overall, but bold and like tangerine jelly with cream. I guess it's nice overall, but I was hoping for something a little less run of the mill."
"Drinkability: Pretty good, it's tasty with some nice elements."
"This one... Comes across, to me, like Hennepin but a touch lighter on the spices. At least... That's how I remember it. I suppose I'd have to do a side by side tasting to really know. And, well, yeah. A couple of big bottles of big beer? That's gonna happen? Not soon! Anyway, it's a fine beer."
"All BAs should take note of how this brew was born before drinking, as it is the ultimate story of two breweries that came to a civil agreement when it could have been adjudicated for years. Instead, this beer is available to all without retainers, fees or litigation."
"I have been anxious to try a russian river brew; while I have yet to try a true RR, this one was a bit of a disappointment after having Avery's salvation. A nice beer, and definitely worth a try."
"D - I remember having this one fresh and I could disticntly taste each beer. It tastes a bit messy after giving it some age. Much better fresh."
"d - Id love to get my hands on as many of these as possible. I wouldnt drink them every day, though I imagine these would cellar very well. Id be curious of how they are after 2+ years."
"Could drink several bottles of this, pretty light although alcohol content is fairly high, very good, one of Avery's best, buy this if possible, even spend the extra dollar if necessary because it will not be brewed again, highly recommended"
"Now, besides your Black & Tan and such, this is my first of the new mixing fad, and I have to say, whatever ratio they settled upon, it works marvelously."
"Pours a slightly cloudy red/orange, nice off white head, some lace spots, head settles down pretty quick to a thin ring. Smell is sweet and malty, sugars, floral, some acidic fruit, light funk. Taste is similar, malty, very fruity, bread, light sour funkiness, dates, nice. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with low to medium carbonation, goes down pretty smooth. A nice product from Avery, definately at the top of their list, thanks Russ!"
"This beer pours a cloudy brown color with a light amber hint. The head large, billowy, and off white. Lacing is thorough with chunks sticking to the side of the glass. The aroma is of caramel, nuts, anise, cream, and dates. The taste is a lot more lively than the aroma. Anise and dark spices play a much more pronounced role in it than they do in the aroma. The mouthfeel is medium-full bodied with lively carbonation, and a smooth texture. Overall, this is a nice beer. It might not be the best dark Belgian ale around, but it is still tasty."
"A decent selection. I would like this witch a rich apple dessert. A great blending from two great brewers. Definitly one to sample for Belgian lovers."
"Upon its dismissal from the 22 ounce bottle, the beer shows off a creamy light tan head that piles high on the mahogany body, after its disappearance, the lacing forms a tight sheet to obscure the glass. Nose is a conglomeration of aromas, sweet malt, bread dough, port wine, cotton candy, caramel, and spices, clove I think. Start has a deep malt sweetness, some alcohol bitterness at the back with the top moderate in feel. Finish has a personable hop spiciness, acidity tolerable, and the aftertaste dry. Magnificent beer, as Belgian Strong(s) are my favorite style, this was a most enjoyable beer."
"D: This is a good Belgian ale, with a unique story behind it. Blending the two brews gives it an interesting character. Nicely done."
"Medium to full body with a natural feeling, subtle carbonation. This is a pleasant and easy drinker, the alcohol is hidden and the overall effect is quite pleasant. Thanks to orrshow for splitting the bottle."
"Drinkability/Notes: Gald I had the opportunity to give this a try. A nice Belgian Strong Dark, lighter in color than most I have tried previously. Very fruity and malty with plenty of belgian dark sugar though rather light in the mouth. A very drinkable beer for sure. Seek and Enjoy."
"Sampled at From The Vine beer tasting Jan 26th, 2007: Hazy dark brown color with a medium thick bone white head that has good retention. Stringy lacing on the glass. Aroma of spices and yeast, along with touches of sweet caramel and malt. Rich body with an interesting flavor profile. It doesnt seem to exactly fit in the Belgian category but you can definitely tell it is part of the blend. Flavors of hops and spices are predominant, along with some yeast and dark fruits. The finish is moderately hoppy with a sweet spice aftertaste. Pretty solid from beginning to end."
"Overall, this was a very good idea that made for a very good beer. Complexity stands out. Recommended!"
"A good Belgian strong with pleasing wine-like tannins and a bit on the tart cherry side. Not for the novice as much as one who appreciates the above. Dark reddish brown and yeast and wine-like aromas. Medium mouthfeel. Very quaffable. One of the best Avery products."
"22 oz bomber. The beer is very deep amber in color with a 2-finger off-white head that sits very strong over the brew. Clarity is excellent, at least to start, and there is a modest carbonation working up. The aroma is a dichotomy between sweet and spicy. There is deep caramel and brown sugar with prevalent fruity esters in there. The spice is almost a little allspice in nature. I think this one smells nice. The flavor is more slanted towards a raisin fruityness and light brown sugar sweetness, with a solid spice that moves into a light bitterness on the finish, along with some distinct ""green"" flavors from the hop. It is very flavorful, with solid complexity I like the little kick from the hop on the finish that rounds the flavor out. Mouthfeel is thick, with a very light carbonation, almost none at all. This one is deceptive, as it drinks like it is about 6%, but it certainly packs more than that. This one is good."
"Drinkability- Not bad. This beer goes down fairly easy considering the alcohol content but it isnt the best Strong Dark Belgium Ive tried (although definitely the best American SDB Ive had, though this may be the first). Im really excited to try each beer that makes this brew up individually. Thanks again to BeerTruth, another great trader!"
"Split a bomber of this with my good friend kboett77. Poured into a tall, rounded white wine glass. Great retention and decent lacing. It's a cloudy reddish-copper with a thin, off-white head. I can see sediment suspended in the beer. Looks like a fresh apple cider. Smells like one, too. Green apples, burnt sugar, tea, and a very green hops. Very fresh and malty character. Flavors of the cider and tea, plus a slightly biscuity malt. Again, the fruity and malty character. Slight hop bitterness on the middle and back of the tongue. Almost like the bitterness of a very strong tea. Medium-bodied mouthfeel. Very drinkable beer. One the most enjoyable Belgian Strong Darks I've ever had. Glad to see what came of this collaboration, and I look forward to more!"
"D: More drinkable than either of them by themselves due to the English Brown Ale flavor."
"Drinkability - grows on me as I progress through the bottle. I would not turn down another tonight in spite of the potency."
"Mouthfeel was typical for a belgian beer, not too heavy not too light. Very drinkable beer, quite smooth. Would like to have more of this to get me through the hot days ahead."
"Definitely drinkable, but not something I'd seek out."
"this is nice brew. next up i see the Czar blended with Supplication"
"Drinkability- This beer is going to age really well!!. I liked it, but couldn't drink another one of these single handily again.It knocked me on my tail, it is a really big beer! Best enjoyed with a good friend. I expect that this one will really shine if you cellared it for a couple years"
"In all I'd take the RR Salvation alone over this, but this is a fine tasting experiment."
"I think I've had Avery's Salvation and recall not digging it so much. If I had to guess it's the Avery brew that's responsible for what I'm not liking about this brew. I find myself not wanting to finish the bottle."
"Drinkability- About what I expected going in. A very tasty beer that I would definitely have again in a minute. Not sure how much aging would do to this one though. May drink my other fairly soon."
"Thanks to Demcorhip for the bottle!"
"Beer poured a reddish brown with a beautiful long lasting off white head. Nose is very nice, of Belgian yeasts, dark fruits and spices. Taste is very much of Belgian yeast with initial alcohol warming, ripened cherries, and finishes somewhat dry. Mouthfeel is very smooth but a bit thinner than hoped. Drinkability is good. This is an interesting collaboration. Having recently visited RRBC and previously enjoying a bottle of Salvation, the qualities of the smooth mouthfeel and dry finish are very familiar. I have had the Avery version as well and the lighter qualities of a strong pale ale are definitely evident. This is something one should try as this collaboration may not happen again!"
"A neat 'collaboration'. A very cool concept that was well marketed and a good reflection on both brewers. Nice to see big name breweries work together on such interesting projects. I wouldn't say this was a natural, sublime mix - the beer really was quite average - however it did make for a tasty treat. Thanks Grub!"
"Leaning medium-full in the mouth, it is given levity with a steady carbonation. Solid all around, and a pretty nifty experiment to boot."
"If you prefer your Belgian Ales on the non-sweet side, you will probably enjoy this one. It has good flavor and complexity, but it doesn't taste like an alcoholic jolly rancher. Recommended."
"drinkability is good. well balanced and enjoyable."
"D: Definitely a sipping beer. Very enjoyable!"
"Avery's Salvation is up next. This is a very nice beer but seemed a bit scaled back when done as a side by side with RR's version."
"Drinkability: I prefer the RR to the Avery and I notice that this beer starts out like the RR but the Avery elements become more apparent after the swallow; letting this beer age a year or two tones down the bitterness and makes it a superior BSDA, in my opinion"
"M/D: Nothing really wrong here. No limitations in any way. The beer is pleasant and nice to drink."
"Still, this is a tasty beer that should be tried by all."
"All in all, an enjoyable, leftfield BSDA - I wish we'd see more collaborations of this type. Big high five to Avery and Russian River for this."
"Drinkability/notes: Very pleasant and drinkable, with a wonderful palette of complexity. There is much to admire in the collaboration of Avery and Russian River, both from the brewing and the ethical standpoints."
"This will be the second time I have had this brew, the first time was about six months ago. It has virtually disappeared from metro Denver and the fine folks at Liquor Max still had a couple bottles. I thought Avery did not bottle condition their beers but there appears to be a layer of yeast at the bottom of the bomber. The beer itself is dark ruby red in color and translucent. It smells like sweet sugar and fruits. The smell really lets you know this beer is going to be good. This has a very good taste, with only the slightest medicinal twinge, which doesnt detract from this beer in the least. This beer is actually easy drinking for such a high ABV but it does eventually start to warm the belly. I am looking forward to trying both the Avery Salvation and the Russian River salvation in the future."
"Very velvety mouthfeel. Smooth yet substantial. Quite drinkable. I think the notes from the golden ale really help to balance out some of the sweeter notes in the dark ale, which overall helps drinkablility. An interesting blend, I didn't expect to enjoy it as much as I did."
"Not a bad combination. I'm a big fan of the russian river salvation, but haven't sampled the avery version. This beer was a caramel color with about a two-finger head. There was a sweetness to this beer, reminiscent of toffee or burnt sugar. Not a lot of complexity or development of the flavors. Despite the nice head I found this beer to be a little flat. I'll have to try the avery salvation before I make any final conclusions, but I think I'm more of a fan of the rr salvation unmixed. This isn't a bad beer, but the bar was set pretty high for this one by it's components."
"Tastes much sweeter and less attenuated than RR's Salvation. Also what makes RR's version so enjoyable is the astronomical level of delicate complexities provided by their yeast strains; this quality is kind of diminished by the sweetness of Avery's. That being said RR's beer is much more noticable in the finish product. Very good beer but I'll stick with RR's Salvation."
"Poured into my RR tulip glass. Cloudy prune brown, huge off white head. Smell is sweet belgian candi sugar and dark fruit. Taste- initially quite sweet, but finishes dry due to the sugar. Lots of dark fruit, spice and complex malt. Hops are more noticable than in the average belgian dark and are a welcome presence. Mouthfeel is smooth with medium carbonation. A great brew. I have not tried either of these individually, but have a bottle of RR Salvation in my cellar ready to compare on a special occasion."
"Taste is mild as well, with lots of nice warming alcohol off the top. There's some mild citrus-peel notes that lend a refreshing bittering sourness to offset the malt monster that this is. Caramel appears again, along with that mild banana flavour. Big bready flavours, yeast, it all points to a delcious piece of cake in your mouth. Belgian sugars and a peppery spiciness back all that up. Not too heavy in the mouth, which is nice and makes the brew slide down nicely, as does the not-overbearing carbonation. Dry and spicy in the finish. This is a respectable American take on a Belgian Strong, but it just falls short of great for me. That said, it's extremely drinkable for such a potent brew."
"A great team is greater than the sum of it's individual players. This is more like the 2006 Yankees. Hall of Fame players, disappointing result. The beauty of RR's finesse is obliterated by Avery's power."
"Poured into a chalice a slightly cloudy light amberish color, nice carbonation, small off-white head, very little sticky lacing around the edges. The nose is malty, citrusy, figs, raisins, plums, and some caramel. The taste is malty, tangy, citrusy, slightly sweet, spicy, nice touch of caramel. The finish is slightly dry. Medium body. Very drinkable, a nice little together brew, recommended."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: It's medium bodied and a bit chewy. It's pretty drinkable though. I'm sipping it just to see how much the flavor comes alive as it warms, but it's definitely not hard to drink. Overall, it's good and intriguing. Certainly recommended."
"Nearly clear, deep amber colour with a short, fine head that produced solid sheets of lacing. Nifty aroma - citrusy, yeasty, spicy, and fruity. Solid bitterness with citrusy undertones and a moderate sugary fruit sweetness. Chewy malts throughout with a spicy alcohol finish. Full bodied, delicate carbonation, creamy with some pleasant warmth. This stuff hides its alcohol well. Nicely balanced and easy drinking."
"Body is a hazed orange/brown hue with a large offwhite head that hangs around for several minutes. Generous amounts of sheet lacing drape the goblet. Inviting aroma of dark fruits, musty yeast, bubblegum, guava, prunes and a hint of licorice. Mouthfeel has medium carbonation and body and some alcohol burn. Taste has lots of dark fruits, mostly figs and prunes. Bitter citrusy hops and yeast are also noted. Somewhat phenolic and abrasive with some harsh alcohol tones. An interesting concept here but I was hoping for a better result."
"This beer is a nice reddish brown with a lasting head. The smell is smokiness and alcohol. The taste is caramel, smoked salmon and there is a nice alcohol finish. The alcohol lingers in the aftertaste and burns a little in the finish. The beer is a sipper that gets better as it warms. A very good beer that should age well."
"What an interesting concept. Russian River and Avery making a hybrid of their beers called Salvation. It smells amazing, but the taste and balance are completely out of whack. Not to say it's bad at all, but it might do well with some serious aging."
"This is certainly a slow sipper. I'm glad I've had the opportunity to try it, but I don't think I'll seek it out again."
"Bomber, bottled Jan 2007. I have been chilling this for a few months, waiting for a good moment to savor. It pours lighter than I expected. The head is a good one finger and lingers with lacing. The aroma is faint, not very strong at all. The first flavor for me was faint banana. Some slight spice and fig flavor but it's not very pronounced. Although it is a good beer, i would not call it exceptional or unique to my palate."
"Pours a somewhat hazy, orange to brown color. Slightly phenolic aroma-quite yeasty and bread like. Very phenolic tasting. Bordering on astringent and solvent like. Slight spiciness to it. Again with the yeast characteristics. Medium body. Overall I cant find much here to get excited about. While a notch above average it doesnt overwhelm me in any way shape or form. I have had much better from Avery. Try it yourself and form your own opinion."
"Pours a slightly hazy golden dark brown color. Thick foamy slightly off white head settles slowly. Nice aroma of fresh bread is very pronounced, along with some brown sugar like sweet smell. Tastes amazing with a very good balance. At first, the hops seem like they want to overpower the flavor, but the added sugar along with the barley and wheat help to balance it out nicely. Mouthfeel is nice and full bodied, a little thick, not overly carbonated. A Very nice and drinkable ale. I'd love to try the two respective beers that go into it, and see how each contributes to the flavor. It's amazing. I could drink this every day."
"Bottle courtesy of Demcorhip: Poured a cloudy deep copper color ale with a nice foamy head with good retention. Aroma of sweet malt and medium funky yeast is pretty interesting. Taste of sweet malt is mix with some subtle sour notes and some light funky yeast. Body is quite full with some adequate carbonation and no alcohol was discernable. Overall, this seems like a good concept but I still think I would prefer having my own bottle of RR salvation instead of this."
"This is a really good brew but lacks that certain oomph that just makes me want to drink it all night. It reminds me of Matilda mixed 60:40 with Pere Jacques. The roasted malt and bitterness add to it's complexity but also limits it's drinkability. Kudos to Adam and Vinnie for the collaborative effort. More brewing companies should act the way these guys do."
"A collaboration well worth the time. A nicely put together beer, that offers a lot of complexity. Recommended."
"drinkability: nice"
"For my 100th review I thought how awesome it would be to review a fine collaboration of two awesome breweries into one amazing looking ale. Poured into a stone russian imperial stout snifter, pours an amazing copper redish brown with a fluffy 2 finger head that leaves some serious lace on the glass. Smell is of fresh malt and bread also a bit of figs and dates in the nose and just a hit of hoppy finish as well. Taste is a bit of malt of upfront with some fresh grapes and also a bit of earth, a little bit of bitterness and a bit of a alcohol burn. This is a extremly good offering and such a great idea of mixing the 2 together, awesome job and hopefully will follow with other great collaborations."
"An interesting beer, and a good one, though not one I'm likely to order too often in the future. There are more interesting Belgium and Belgium wannabees out there."
"If this one wasn't so funky tart, it would be much better, but that keeps the drinkability fairly low. The last few sips were a little tough to polish off, but it's definitely worth a go if you can get your hands on a bottle. Or I guess you could just blend them yourself with a heavier hand on Avery's Salvation."
"I don't know - something about it just didn't work for me. it didn't have the standardness throughout - each taste was something new, and whenever it worked, it wouldn't work in the next sense."
"Poured into a tulip glass with a thin head that quickly dissolved. Color is an opaque bourbon with a relatively non-descript aroma of fruit and clove. The taste is, as it should be, the best part of this beer. Smooth and malty with a slightly sugary, molasses taste that is cut by clove and fruit tones. The alcohol is pronounced, but not overpowering. While overall, I don't think this is a top notch Belgian style, but it is pretty good and the backstory is great."
"On-tap at Zenos in State College. Dark, cloudy amberish-brown with a medium-sized, creamy, off-white head that slowly diminishes to a tenacious film. Smell is fairly busy with prune, alcohol, clove, earth, cherry, and a little raisin. The Taste follows suit with its flavors. Wonderful, long, sweet finish of prunes and cherries with a nice bit of alcohol warmth. It has a medium body and lightly syrupy texture. Just a little bit cloying, but still I found this to be a fantastic beer. Definitely worth a try."
"M/D: Nice carbonation kept it from tasting heavy."
"Overall this is an excellent beer, as should be expected from the world class Russian River and the excellent Avery. Good work, gentlemen."
"Poured into a chimay chalice. The head was lacking for the style. The color was a murky light brown. The sediment in the bottle was pured into the last glass and there was a good amount of particles. The aroma was of sweet candi sugar and sweet malted barley. There is a faint scent that is close to pears. The taste is the same sweet malt and candi sugar. The coating of your mouth is strong. Not my favorite from either brewery."
"The Collaboration has a clear, amber appearance with a foamy head withich dissipates a little faster than the Avery Salvation. It smells of carmel and malt with a slightly musty scent picked up from the Avery. Taste is nice and malty with a hint of roasted nuts. Mouthfeel is nice with medium to full body and smooth. Flavorful but nor overwhelming, I wish I coudl get more."
"Thanks Pwoody! (04/09/10)"
"Not entirely sure what to serve this in so i went with my Orval goblet. Oaky brown and bubbly with a nice quarter inch of tan colored head. Odor is sweet and a little Brett-y (does R.R. use Brett in their Salvation?) Other odors of apples and cloves as well. smells very good. Flavor overall is spicy and sour. very clovey, even peppery, with sweet maltiness and some bitter orange as well. I'm also getting a hunk of barnyard in the flavor too, which i'll chalk up to the real or imagined presence of brett in here. Full bodied, maybe on the edge of being syrupy. Very good, I'd definitely get this again if i saw it again."
"The beer was a dark mahogany with an inch of sticky head which subsided, but left some short-lived lace on the glass. A lot going on in the nose -- starts with dried fruit (raisins, plum, cherries), but I also got roasted malt, anise, brown sugar, toffee, and a slight leafy hop. Tastes even more complex -- would be a 5 but for some heat from the booze -- a heavy fruit-malt combo which is fairly well balanced (for the style, which can get fairly sweet) with the herbs & spices (light herbal/floral hops, anise, coriander). Creamy carbonation offsets the syrupiness, and, though it was incredibly delicious, I'm glad I wasn't drinking this 650ml alone... Recommended, but share."
"This is a very interesting creation"
"A very nice example of the style. Flavors are kind of mellow, but it lends to the drinkability. The alcohol is barely noticed. A nice example of the style."
"First off, I really like both these breweries, but I was skeptical after first hearing about this beer and for very good reason. Blending two Belgian style beers both called Salvation just seemed a little too convenient to me. It pours light brown, much more similar to the color of RR Salvation. The nose is rather dull, revealing light notions of spice, bubble gum and fruit. On the palate, up front, there is not a lot there. Some muddled fruits toward the mid-palate with some black licorice hints on the extremely short finish."
"Collaboration Not Litigation is sold under the Avery name, but they and Russian River deserve equal credit in crafting this fine elixir. Though it'd be nice if the two beer were indistinguishable from each other in the taste, one can still say that both Salvations contribute equally in this offering. It's a really great thing that two breweries could work together to create something so unique, and I hope to see (and taste) more beers like this in the future. Thank you Avery and Russian River!"
"Poured from a 650ml bottle that was bottled in Jan 07 into my NBB snifter. The label had an interesting story of how this beer came together as a collaboration between Avery and Russian River. It had a rich mahogany color that had a 2 1/2 finger head. It slowly settled into a constant foam feed by a steady stream of carb. The aroma was sweet malt with dark fruits and strong yeast. Didn't get much of a hop presence. Had a good balance and wasn't overly sweet like I find some BSDA's. The taste was really good and again had a very great balance. It starts out sweet in the middle of the tongue than the flavor hits the sides and finishes strong without a heavy alcohol presence or too much sweetness. The mouthfeel is nice and solid with a gentle attack of carb to round it out. Overall, I really enjoyed this one which suprised me since I'm finding that I don't like too many BSDA's. This one gets the job done without overplaying the ABV or over-relying on raisins for flavoring like some. Highly recommend. (4, RB, T, Y)"
"Drinkability: I've never had an Avery Salvation or a Russian River Salvation before, but I can tell you that both of these combined make for a very good brew that I could easily enjoy again. I'm glad I got to try this one. I sure as hell didn't have a problem drinking a whole bomber by myself. If you Avery and Russian River beers, then you don't want to miss this one. After this, I wish I saw more beer collaborations."
"Medium bodied, smooth brew with a long lasting aftertaste. The abv was felt more than smelled or tasted. For me personally, one bomber would be plenty of this one, as it got a bit heavy towards the end."
"I'd guess that a little more conditioning time would allow the Russian River beer to shine through a little more. I'd like the funky flavors to come through more. I'll have to sit on my other bottle to find out."
"D: I can't really detect the alcohol in here by taste, but by the end of my glass I could start to feel it. This is a great beer and the drinkability is very good, but a bit high on the alcohol to consume a bunch of. I would start off a night with this beer though."
"D: Somewhat drinkable."
"Very drinkable. Note to self...ought to be sitting down for this one. The 8.999 AVB is pleasantly hidden, a tad of warmth in the crest along with a not so subtle surprise if you're not sip'in this one (that's got to be a miss print). Russian River and Avery; you've gotta love it when we all get along!! Cheers!!"
"This is a sipper, but I think will only get more drinkable as it mellows. This this is one to lay down for a year or two, if you have the paitience!"
"The beer pours a ruby red color with a thick frothy offwhite head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is great. It has a wondeful malt scent along with loads of fruity yeast esters. The taste is good. It has a smooth and creamy malt flavor that goes down easy and warms on the finish. It's fruity with Belgian yeast and a bit dry in the finish. The mouthfeel is good. It is a full bodied beer with a adequate/good carbonation. This is an interesting beer. It's got some excellent malt complexities along with a wondeful fruity finish; a good drinker."
"Drinking a cellar temp bottle poured into a snifter. The beer is a clear mahogany with several yeast chunks floating throughout. A minimal edge layer of bleached white head is all that forms. Aroma is fairly fruity with berries and pears mixing with floral hops and some caramel. Average body with a sticky syrupy texture and very fine gentle carbonation. Flavor is very complex with sour cherry, red grapes and general fruitiness rolling to a lingering black pepper spiciness on the finish. No hops on the taste and I dont think the black pepper is from ABV but is a yeast by product. Quite a tasty beer, glad to have tried a bottle."
"This is a cool concept and a one-of-a-kind beer, offering its own take on the style, not straying too far either. I haven't had Russian River's Salvation, and thought the Avery version was good but not mindblowing. Think the Czech and US Budweisers would make as interesting a mixture? Nah, didn't think so."
"Bottled in Jan 07,poured into a fish bowl glass murky tea-like color with chinks and floaties swirling about a thinner head than expected leaving only a tace amount of spotted lace as it settled rather quickly.Mild phenolic aromas hit upfront along with some sweeter bread dough and a hint of wood nothing jumps out all are a bit tame but noticable.Phenolic and spicey with an underlying woddy graininess the fruit is a bit subdued pretty dry on the palate in my mind.Although not a huge fan of the style I was craving it and this although pretty good didnt really give me my fix I was looking for."
"Poured into a tulip glass at Pizzeria Paradiso in Georgetown, Washington, DC. The beer formed a light tan glass ring, with very little cling in its lacing. The body was a translucent honey-amber with red highlights. The nose was lightly fruity, yeasty, and malty, but not pungeant enough for my preferences. However, the true power of the beer was expressed far more so in the taste, which was rich with dark fruitiness, berries, cherries, a touch of an herbal character, some chocolate, and pepper. It hid the alcohol magnificently. The mouth was medium, with very tiny but many bubbles, which led to great carbonation. I would have liked the body to be a tad thicker, though. Overall, a well-balanced brew that I'd be happy to drink often."
"This beer is a treat. I really like Salvation, and this is quite similar. It's an interesting concept. Has a cloudy appearance, thick with floaties. Sweet and fruity, great drinkability. ABV not noticed in taste. Really defies category, as Avery Salvation is a golden ale. This is not as dark as other Belgian dark ales either. Also, not quite a dubbel. If you find it, give it a shot. Unique, high quality brew."
"Drinkability: Very unique ale, the aroma is intense, the flavor is quick. All in all, tasty, even pretty hoppy, less malty than other Belgian SDAs."
"Drinkability: The bitterness/cough medicine-like quality to this brew keeps it from being very enjoyable, or drinkable."
"Drinkability: This is a decent beer that I probably won't revisit unless it's the best thing available. For $10 a bottle, I could do much better."
"'Tis a tasty collaboration. (Review 400)"
"A good choice and a delight to drink."
"Poured into a heavy glass chalice, formed a 1/2"" beige head over the cloudy reddish amber brew. Head holds strong, with heavy, non-falling lace. Aroma is yeasty spicy dark fruity. Taste starts with spicy maltiness, segues into a dark fruit presence, and closes with some earthy hoppiness and an encompassing warmth. Mouthfeel is creamy smooth, and drinkability is excellent for the style. A great collaborative process has yeilded a great beer."
"Flavor was heavy on wholesomeness. Surprisingly wheaty. Yeast very pungent and seemed to coat the cheeks. A tad sour as well. Picked out some light fruits as well. Mouthfeel was a tad short of full and perhaps a bit syrupy. Served a bit too cold and I hate to let it warm up to really notice the flavors."
"good drinkability especially when the abv is considered, though not a session beer by any stretch of the imagination. a real nice rendition of the belgian strong dark."
"With a high %abv I wouldn't consider this a great session beer but it is still a very nice mixture of two great breweries/Russian River and Avery."
"D - I really expected something more over the top on this one. As it turned out I got a very drinkable beer that captures the Tao of the Belgian strong dark style in a quiet way."
"The body is medium with a crisp carbonation and a decent bitterness. The finish is long lasting. Mild alcohol burn. I enjoyed it. Even though I still like the individual beers better on their own, I think it is great to see two great breweries collaborating like this. Whether it be as simple as blending their respective brews, or actually brewing a totally different beer, I think more brewers should be doing this."
" Well done, good drinkabilty, alcohol is well hidden, flavors are bold and refreshing."
"To me, NO alcohol presence, very subdued and subtle. Thanks to Colorado again."
"Drinkability:"
"Overall- I drank 2 pints of this and it became too cloying. Not a bad tasting beer but very its very sweet and the alcohol is always present."
"Really unique, and really enjoyable!!! However, I should note that this is one of those beers that you either love or hate. If you're on board for Orval and clovey-phenolic Belgians, then you'll probably go ape-shit for this one. If not, avoid it like the plague (to use another cliche). For me, I'm going to stock up on as much as I can afford right now. A new personal favorite :)"
"Purchased: Plaza Liquors, Tucson AZ"
"Mouthfeel is nice. Moderate carbonation, not enough sweetness to be an issue. Quite drinkable with ABV remaining where it shoud - In the background. A great beer. Already purchased another."
"Very Nice!"
"Deep shade of mahogany. Slightly hazy. Thick crop of frothy white head. Lacing is quite full. Got a little sweet and sour aspect on the nose. A little sweet cherry mixes with a little sour ""Brett"" like character. This experiment tastes pretty good. Nice belgian maltiness. A little biscuity. Pretty warm overall. Some candy like sweetness comes into play as well. A little fruitiness. Like mangos. Carbonation is nicely subdued. Light to light-medium body. The alcohol is held in check nicely. Very enjoyable brew. Good experiment."
"Certainly easy to drink but this beer lacks the flavor to deliver on the promise the smell promises. Worth a try but there are better versions."
"Overall: This beer was good, and I am glad to have had the chance to try it. I might buy it again in the furtue."
"Typical Avery bomber, silver foil top, bottled in Jan 2007. Pours murky, cloudy light brown/dark apricot, head is active and long lasting medium tan and this creation leaves nicely developed and sticky lacing in sheets and splotches. Nose here is fruity, raisins and some light smoke. Be sure to let this one warm up and get a chance to breath. Fruity, more smoke, raisins, warming alcohol well dove-tailed into the mix. Quite drinkable and balanced, abit differant from some of the other Avery offerings (which I love anyway for their boldness). Spicy, peppery, mild smoky hot sauce, drying finish.Drinking very well at this early date, seems it would only improve with some time. Go get some to enjoy now and in a year."
"What it lacks in complexity and character is made up in the drinkability. Unfortunately, at $7.99 per bottle, this will be the only example that comes out my cellar."
"A well done collaboration. Recommended."
"Pours a hazy amber with a thick head of small tan bubbles. Smell is caramel candies and a hint of musty Belgian yeast. As it warms, more yeast and a nutty, roasty aroma comes out. Tastes follows suit with aroma, add a touch of fruit. Figs, raisins. Aftertaste is yeasty and dry, in a good way. Toasted grain is evident in the finish as well. Awesome collaboration that (in my opinion) surpasses either single brew in complexity and enjoyment. Well done Avery and Russian River! I will gladly help fund your next visit to Belgium with results like this."
"In a blind taste test, I would have a hard time telling the difference in this and Chimay Blue. A nice beer overall and I like the name of the beer as well. The only complaint is I wish this was available in a smaller beer, like a 12oz. That way I could save some if I didnt want to drink all 22oz. Definitely drink this one!"
"This is a solid beer, produced by two solid brewers. It just slightly misses the mark in a couple of categories."
"Pours a somewhat hazy medium dark brown with a fairly short head and quite good lacing. The smell is interesting- Belgian yeast esters up front and hops on the rear. Cherries, cloves, banana, and spicy hops. The flavor is a similar cross polination of Belgian yeast and hops. Flavors are similar to the smell with notes of wax, cream, and an additional non-hop bitterness as well. Quite delicious, but not a perfect marriage. If anything, the bitterness is even more prevalant than the Avery Salvation alone. Good creamy mouthfeel and pretty interesting drinking."
"Smell is yeast / dough, some caramelised sugar, a bit of a roasted grain note, and some dark fruit. Taste is almost like a rich hefeweizen. A bit of spice, and of course yeast. A bit of confectioner's sugar, as well. Plenty of nice flavours present here without being too sweet or assertive in any way. I nice beer. Glad I have several of these stored away."
"Poured into a tulip glass from a bomber. Poured a dark amber almost purple in some light. Big thick head with good lacing. Strong aroma of plums and raisins. Taste was fruity and spicy with some hop bitterness and a bit of an alcoholic bite. Went down very easily. Excellent blend of talents of two great brewers, I can't wait to see if they come up with more."
"Pours a nutty brown color, like the shell of a Brazil nut, with a delicate head that leaves a lot of lacing. Enticing candi-sugar-and-ester aroma, with an interesting mix of light and dark sugar notes and lots of phenols. On the palate, the first thing that hits are sharp carbonation and hops. The palate is zesty and light for the style, which is a welcome change from most US Belgians and highlights the strengths of US beers brewed in the Belgian style rather than the weaknesses. After the hops, some slightly sweet malts crop up, but they serve to strengthen the mouthfeel more than they sweeten the palate. Some fruits pop up toward the finish, but they're subdued compared to the hops. Overall, this is quite an interesting beer. It seems to me more comparable to an Abbey dubbel than a strong dark ale -- it's got a dryness that many strong dark ales lack, especially those made in America. Regardless, its very good and welcome as a departure from thick, overly sweet Belgian-style beers made in the USA."
"Good feel, nothing too sharp or sweet or syrupy. Easy drinking, alcohol remains a bit hidden."
"This blend of two Belgian style beers with the same name came in a 22 oz. bomber with a silver neck foil. When poured, the reddish brown body looked closer to the Russian River Salvation part of the mix than the paler Avery Salvation. The overall appearance was similar to a Dubbel, with the exception of the clarity of the beer. Nice fizzy head, and thick lacing made this look quite good. The smell was that of sour cherry, banana, clove, and mandarin orange. The taste was dry, earthy, and spicy, making this quite a departure from the typical Avery Belgians, which I usually find to be floral, and a little sweet. This was quite a yeasty beer, with dusty tongue tingling phenols. The mouthfeel was little thinner than I would have liked. A little thicker, and it would have reached the lofty silkiness of Aventinus, which it kept reminding me of. Vinnie and Adam should think about having more collaborations in the future (despite the beer names being different). Pliny the Elder Maharaja would be hard to pass up."
"A nicely blended brew (s?). An interesting convept that worked out very well and a worthwhile endeavor!"
"Cheers2Beers"
"On tap obriens. Medium brown pour into a chalice. Not much head to speak of therefore no lace either. Sweet with hints of cherries, plums and a strong hop finish dominate the nose. Taste is more of the same with some pepper notes and the definite cherry/plum sort of sweetness. As it warms a sort of smoky malt character comes through. It isnt cloying because the finish is rather dry. Body is light with a medium-high level of carbonation. Something a bit raw tasting here. D is decent. The alcohol is well hidden."
"Collaboration Not Ligitagation Ale pours a hazy copper color with a thick tan head from a brown twenty two ounce bottle. The aroma is kind of mild, and fruity in a Belgian sort of way. Taste is malty and fruity. I've never had either version of Salvation(can't get the Russian River version here, but I do have the Avery version in the fridge), so I can't compare, but this is definitely worth a try."
"So when Rocky Mountain High meets California Cool, it might not be a big crackle, but it does ignite some nice sparks. There's a neat story here, and the beer is a worthwhile venture. The ABV is a mother, gutsy and just short of hot, but it's a part of a gladly drinkable package. When all's said and done, the Avery/Cilurzzo detente ends up being an engaging endeavor."
"Well done Avery and RR. I really wish we could get RR beers here in TX..."
"D- This beer didn't really have that much complexity or richness and was a bit thin. I thought the flavors of hefe-weizen yeast really came through stronger than I would have liked."
"As a side note, egajdzis poured each of the Salvations into a glass as a comparison and it tasted exactly the same as the preblended Collaboration."
"Quite a nice brew, absolutely gorgeous, containing so many excellent attributes of better Belgian-style brews...lovely, lovely...yummy, yummy..."
"I can't detect very much of Avery's Salvation in here. The carbonation is similiar but everything else is very different. This is a fun and enjoyable beer though and a great idea. Hopefully we can see more brewers coming together like this in the future. I just need to get my hands on Russian River's Salvation now to complete the trilogy."
"Drinkability: This is what I would label as a special occasion beer or maybe a fire side beer. All in all this is a great brew and a great story to go with it. Great job guys, I really enjoyed this one."
"Beer is good. Happy collaboration beering."
"Opinion: This is a pretty decent beer, and I think that it will really benefit from cellaring for a year or two at a cool temperature. Right now it just tastes a bit green and the flavors haven't really melded yet. It is good, and I like the fact that I am supporting Adam, Vinnie, Tomme, Sam and Rob to go to Belgium. It is some gimmick, but I think that all of us beer snobs will benefit from them going on that trip. I will probably pick up a few more to support the effort, and maybe review it again in 2009 or some such."
"Since I have never had either of the Salvation beers that were blended to make this, I can't comment on how they mix, but I can say that this is a nice, easy-drinking ale. Good work and thanks for collaborating!"
"This blending of RR & Avery salvations is pure gold..."
"Creamy tan head, dried orange peel nose. Body is creamy and smooth, no alcohol presence. Spicy citrus and chocolate flavors. Very earthy, nearly soil notes in the aftertaste, dry,chalky, herbal."
"Thin to medium bodied and again not really my style."
"For sure haven't had RR's Salvation, and I can't remember if I've tried Avery's. Would be interesting to have both Salvations and this beer together for a tasting. Overall nice beer."
"Nice beer overall...nothing amazing but pretty solid collaboration. Worth trying a bottle for sure."
"Notes: I would have liked a sturdier body and a bit more of the woody side that I liked. Ehhhh....this isn't that good of a mix to me. I thought it would be solid gold and bought 4 bottles, no worries though as its just below average."
"Drinkability - With the high alcohol and seeming lack of depth, this really isn't one that I'd find myself drinking too often (if again.) I typically like Avery beers, haven't had any Russian River but certainly have heard the hype, and I have to say I'm a little disappointed in this."
"An interesting beer, though I can't tell where the Avery ends, and the Russian River begins. I think I like the concept more than the beer it produced."
"Interesting brew."
"D - nice, very nice, don't know if i'd get it again, but very nice. though, since this is closest thing we have in portland to a true russian river brew... who knows..."
"drinkability: pretty easy"
"Verdict: more collaboration please. One or two of these are more than enough, but damn that flavor is awesome."
"D: A nice collaboration, no pun intended! Interesting with a nice fully body. I hope they sell every last one of these so those guys can make that trip to Belgium. I played my part in sending them---you'd better also!"
"very drinkable and enjoyable. drinkability gets a bump in score due to the concept of the beer. being a blend of two already established recipes, there's a certain amount of questioning/probing that doesn't need to take place. relax and enjoy!"
"The finish does get a bit syrupy sweet, but not too sweet I couldnt finish the bottle. ABV is well hidden too."
"D - Well, I have never had either of these beers before. I won't have this again, but I do plan to try both salvations. Love the name though, enjoy your trip to Belgium. I sure hope the consumers can reap the benefits of that excursion. The mouthfeel really kills the beer."
"Drink: Yes, bring more. Brew more, in fact! Not likely. In ol' PA it's pricey but I'd get several bottles otherwise and would love to see how this grows and changes over a year or so."
"really interesting beer, definitely check it out, I want to put some age on this one to see where it goes. went well with a mixed plate of mild cheese."
"Highly drinkable and enjoyable beer, I hope to see more collaberations in the future. In the meantime, stock up on this."
"d: very nice surpise, especially considering avery salvation wasn't too memorable when i tried it in the past (makes me want to try it again to re-visit the palate). very smooth, good belgian interpretation by 2 brewers -- maybe there should be more microbrew collaborations."
"P.S. damn it I want to go on that trip with them."
"This one pours leaving a thick off white head over a half-inch and it holds well. The beer is a chocolate amber color that that is barely tranlucent with some decent clarity. Spiced aroma of corainder and yeasts, seeming very ""authentically Belgian"". The first sip starts out very tangy with lots of dark fruit, and then quickly changes to a strong nutty finish. At first the finish tastes like peanut butter, and its very dry, but after a few more sips I realize there is a bit of DMS flavor there perhaps, although this is only a minor distraction. Thankfully, the alcohol is not too overpowering. I enjoyed the full, silky mouthfeel of this beer. Plenty of foamy carbonation. This beer is good, but will probably seem a bit overhyped being partially from Russian River and all. Worth getting a bomber or two, and if you like it get some more..."
"D- a good beer with a great concept behind it, I would love to see more breweries do things like this, definitely try this while it is available"
"Two perfectly good Belgians mixed to the betterment of both."
"This beer captures the best of both of these beers. I was hoping for a bit more funky bret in this beer. Perhaps that would have ruined the blending. I am glad I have a few more of these on hand."
"I hope that someday soon Russian River will start distributing to Ohio so I won't have to wait for the occasional west coast business trip to pick up their awesome beers."
"Cheers!"
"The mouthfeel is pretty solid with upfront tones of dryness that sets the stage for the rest of its character. Beyond medium in body with barely a slice of dark sweetness to keep it backed up in balance as it stays fairly straight up dry with the yeast and earthy settings. It has a tendency to change its balanace from time to time, especially as it warms, regardless, its heavy ended towards the dry at first so be patient if that's not your thing. But its not overwhelmingly so; its quite manageable really, and a pleasing combo, or blending, of styles that most will like. Quite nice once its been breathing a while."
"Poured a beautiful clear brown with a huge frothy head. Smell was very spicey, grassy and earthy tones with a hint of sweetness. The taste was classic belgian and very nicely done. Fruitness and spices predominate, no hint of alcohol, which at 9%abv is incredible. Really smooth and effortless in drinkability. This is a fantastic brew, way too easy to drink, honestly the easiest 9% I have ever had. This is a must get as it is remarkable."
"Very nicely done, but @ $7/22oz., once is more than enough."
"This is a nice offering and am looking forward to drinking some more. If you get the chance definitely give this one a shot."
