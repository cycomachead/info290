Poured a murky light brown with tons of sediment with a two finger khaki colored head that subsided to half a finger very slowly. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, bread, dark fruit, and raisins. The flavor was of sweet malt, bread, dark fruit, raisins, and cream. It had a heavy feel on the palate with medium carbonation which reminded me of a thin milkshake. Overall this was a decent brew. At first this one was a little off-putting due to all of the sediment present in it. Even with all of the sediment present in this glass the flavor and aroma on this one was still quite nice. There was a ton of dark fruit going on here, specifically raisin. This was definitely the factor that made this brew enjoyable. Definitely worth trying with or without the sediment.","thagr81us","May 10, 2012"

A frothy, off-white head appears but dissipates quickly, leaving only a thin covering. The aroma is extraordinary - with spices and many fruity elements, such as green apple, pear, and plum. Flavor - has some tart cherry that I did not detect in the aroma as well as the apple spice. Begins very sweet and has a touch of bitterness in the finish. I am noticing a woody earthiness, that comes off a little chalky to me. I'm taking some points off for this. The beer coats the palate nicely and the alcohol heat only reveals itself once it's down.

3.46,-17.2,3.5,3.75,3.25,3.5,3.5,"Yeah, that's right, this is the Emperor's tripel, boy! Anyway, this stuff pours a mostly clear sunset bronze-amber topped by a finger of off-white foam. Some floaties show up, but nothing much to speak of. The nose comprises plenty of dark fruits (primarily figs, though some dates shine through as well), Belgian yeast, clove, light cinnamon, candied orange peel, and good amount of sweet biscuit. The taste brings in more of the same, leading with the spices, then into a sweeter version of the fruits, then a strong wave of caramel, biscuit, and booze. The body is a lithe medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a sorta/kinda drying finish. Overall, a nice tripel, but the booze is a touch off-putting, and it comes across more like a spicy BSDA than a tripel, but it still ain't bad.","TMoney2591","Mar 08, 2012"

4.2,0.5,4,4,4.5,4,4,"I warmed up to this beer as it warmed to ambient temperature. The label of a dark Tripel really threw me off. This is a Belgian Strong Dark in my opinion, and it should flaunt this fact, as it is a great showcase for the style. All the good qualities are there: high ABV that's well hidden, stone fruit prominent in the nose and flavor, great body, and rich flavors that are offset by the barely there hops, used only for bittering purposes. The only complaint or word of wisdom would be to watch out for the temperature for this beer, because I let it sit out too much and it started tasting like grape juice a little too much. Grape juice with spices and bitterness, that is.","Philousa","Feb 11, 2012"

Pours a murky mahogany with a dense and frothy two inch, cream-colored head that eventually settles into a solid quarter inch cap. Lots of floaties present in solution and also dispersed across the surface of the head. I'm really digging the nose on this - candied dark fruit (figs and prunes) at first, but there's also an earthy woodiness present in the mix, as well as a trace of spice. Taste follows nose - not as sweet or cloying as suggested by the nose. A bit of caramel or toffee follows that candied fruit before revealing some cherry tartnesss towards the finish. Mouthfeel is medium-light with a pleasant, even carbonation and a light bit of astringency towards the end. A truly top notch example of the style. Easy drinking and complex without being overly sweet. Alcohol is extremely well-hidden as well at 10%. I'll have to pick-up a newer vintage to see how it compares.","Jwale73","Jan 21, 2011"

A real smooth, medium body that borders on creaminess. Has a strong, sweet taste of caramel, chocolate and some sugary/sticky like maple or...a touch of breadiness gives the malts balance and a bit of its dry edge. There are also some citrc hops and something akin to tropical fruits in the backend, giving a slightly fruity taste as it finishes which works well w/ the malts.

Fleeting tan head, thick solid ring remained, some lacing in sheets easily regenerated with a swirl that featured small-bubble clusters at the centre. Small bubble carbonation hidden in the murky haze but continued to drift upwards. Smell of caramel, sweet molasses, brown sugar, yeast. Taste is caramel, sweet dark fruit, raisins, figs, bitter, touch of sour, long drawn out finish with alcohol weighing in with a warming affect, although not offensive considering the ABV.

Overall this was an odd one, there was nothing really bad at all about it, but it just did not really stand out to me as anything fantastic other the very smooth nature of it. Almost silk like it was solo smooth. This was definitely a nice triple, but to be honest I have had better. Thats ok though it is still a very good beer and something I would say you should definitely try if given the chance.","mikesgroove","Oct 10, 2007"

Nose is rich with the aroma of black cherries, walnuts, sweet malt, hints of alcohol, and fresh toasted bread, what a treat to just smell this beer. Start is sweet with malt and cherries, touch of spices, and the top medium to full.

4.97,18.9,4.5,5,5,5,5,"From the moment I unrapped the foil, I knew this was going to be something exceptional. First time I've come accross a brew that was both bottle capped and corked so that a corkscrew was necessary. The cork was simply drenched in sticky candied sugar which was a spectacular first glimpse of what was to come. At first, I thought this was a traditional chocolate brown brew, but once I brought it up to the light I was amazed to find a ruby red elixir with specks of yeast, like a snowstorm in a glass. Wow. The head was modest following the pour, but foamy traces were found with each swirl of the glass. Very surprinsing appearance and just another indicator that this was one unique Belgian. The smell of sweet candied sugar was very pronounced in the nose with aged strawberries and other like-fruit. This is an expressive nose moreso than any other I can remember. So far, I love the aggressiveness of this beer. The taste was incredibly fruity. Strawberries again with cherries drenched in candied sugar and maple syrup. Alcohol was evident in the finish, but fruity sweetness preavailed. Mind you, the sweetness is strong, but in a very, very pleasant way. It's not sweet like a lambic. It's more like an aged port wine with perfect fruitiness and sweetness in harmony with one another. The mouthfeel is viscous and chewy. The beer bathes the tongue in a thick blanket of candied sugar and fruit. With each pull from my tulip glass, the aroma and taste made for an incredibly consumming sensory experience. Some alcohol notes in the finish but the fruit and sugar rule the day. This is an excellent, drinkable treat. So suprising in so many ways and so very worth it. Highly distinctive from all the rest and that is precisely what makes it worthwhile. I very much recommend it.","jim102864","Apr 03, 2007"

Unfortunately, I didn't realize just how much sediment was in this, when I threw it into a cooler and drove it across town. Hence, there were very large yeast chunks floating about in my Chimay chalice. This definitely hurt the appearance, but I'm sure proper storage and slow decanting could save this from happening. Otherwise, the beer had a thin, but lasting, light tan head over a murky brown body. The nose was strong on burnt caramel, with dark fruits and yeast there, too. The taste was slightly burnt caramel, with dark fruits. Very rich, and hid the alcohol well. The mouth was medium-thick, with low carbonation.

Its like smelling a glass full of fresh fruit. Cherries, peaches, plums, grapes, raisins, bananas, and berries, all mingling with yeast. Theres a little Belgian malt in the aroma as well, but the fruity character of the beer is the most amazing quality of the beer. Its a sweet beer, with a spice balance.

Scents of the attributes of Belgian yeast and dark malt are present as well, with hints of chocolate, plums, dark grapes, toffee and maple. The front palate begins with hints of burnt black currants, anise and a touch of cocoa beneath, which leads into the mid-palate, which is full of juicy bright red and dark fruits and light toffee.

Huge thanks to LuckySevens82 for providing me with this one. Reviewed from detailed notes taken yesterday. Pours a three finger frothy caramel head over a dark amber (somewhat brownish) liquid with large flakes whirling around. Smells of alcohol, candi-sugar, caramel, toffee, hints of chocolate, bready, and just a touch of cherry sour. Tastes smooth creamy. Chocolate, caramel, yeast, and mild phenol. The aftertaste persists a long time with rising and falling caramel, toffee, coffee, and alcohol sting. This is a beer for times when you would like to ponder. I spent the whole evening sipping on this beer and contemplating the aftertaste. Pheonlic funk is minimal, but noticable. Not tremendouly funky...more of an edgy phenolic that's tempered quite well by caramel flavor and a dextrinous mouthfeel. Soured grain flavor, somewhat cherry upon the swallow. Like a caramel covered cherry. Md carbonation and md-thick to thick mouthfeel. Whoa, there was a bunch of yeasty flakes in that last pour from the bottle. Overall, this was an enjoyable beer that I was happy for the opportunity to try...but, I'd much rather have an Abbot 12 or Rochefort 10.","mentor","Oct 31, 2005"

Aroma has a lot of sweet candied sugar notes, dark fruit , some toasted bread, some funky yeast character...pretty typical strong dark ale but with a bigger sweetness. The taste is instensely sweet also, with big dark candied sugar and molasses notes, toasted bread, funky yeast, and some mild alcohol notes.

I just don't find this many floaties attractive. Tremendous yeast on the nose, cherries, raisins, plums and spice--and my nose is stuffed beyond belief. Rich full body complemented with perfect medium carbonation, creamy and palate coating(maybe the floaties are helping out here). Incredible malt depth. There's a continuous interplay of flavors on the tongue in no specific order. It's nutty, spicy, clove, cherry, apple, strong single malt scotch characteristics floating around too. Really quite amazing and while tremendously malty, never cloying or overly sweet at all. Dries in the finish with a spicy hops, almonds, coriander, black pepper and scotch. Simply incredible. There's so much here that i want to chew on it. 10% alcohol drinks like 5. Slight warming in the throat. Perhaps my favorite belgian yet, indeed I think I prefer this to westy 12.","numenor1","Oct 08, 2005"

Smell is huge: super fruity, rich, caramel, very sweet like candy with raspberries and sweet potatoes. Mouthfeel is lighter than hoped. Taste was disappointing at first because so much smaller than the nose; but caught up, at warmer temperatures, with some rich, darker flavors like prunes and raisins. You can feel the warmer alcohol as you go on; drinkability is high, but this beer demands to be savored, with the rich flavors and the warming alcohol, so can't drink too quickly.","texashammer","Oct 04, 2005"

4,-4.3,4.5,4.5,4,3.5,3.5,"The beer is quite dry up front, almost surprisingly so, but it quickly moves to a full sweet flavor that dominates the beer through to the finish. There is a nutty, almond note here, think of Amaretto, that really comes out with the sweetness. I also get hints of cherry, vanilla, toffee, caramel, clove. The finish has a light astringency to it that is quickly followed by a light bitterness that makes a faint attempt at balancing the sweetness. This beer is definitely quite rich, and actually has quite a similar flavor profile to the other beers I have had from this brewery. It is perhaps a bit too sweet though, which seems to drown out what might otherwise be a pretty complex beer. Though it is certainly is drinkable, almost as an after dinner desert.","Gueuzedude","Sep 25, 2005"

Head lasts incredibly well, and when it does start to recede, leaves heavy sparkling lace coating the sides. Aroma is tart dark fruits, with an unlying malt sweetness and some spiciness. Taste is not quite as pleasing as the nose to me, with the dark fruits almost seeming overripe, and the alcohol more pronounced, rather than lining up nicely with all the other flavors. Mouthfeel and drinkability are limited a bit by the flavors noted above, although for the style not totally out of line. Had high expectations, and was disappointed a bit here. Still worth your time though, for sure.","ppoitras","Sep 21, 2005"

Light could penetrate when held up to a light source, but it would have difficulty piercing through. Nose was sickly sweet malty with some rpunes and figs. Flavor was not nearly as yeasty as I was expecting. It was kind of flat and dull. The malts came across as a bit too sweet and the fruit I picked up in the aroma came through as overripe. Picked up some cherries too which kind of saved this beer for me. Alcohol was also very nicely hidden. Mouthfeel was surprisingly lighter than I thought.

Fat upcharging head of well over an inch, rocky and leaving plenty of attractive laces on the glass. Strong aroma, light alcohol, rummy molasses, and cling peaches. Mouthfeel is medium, carbonation follows suit, fairly smooth and somewhat creamy. Very fruit initially, lots of candied fruit in syrup, fortified wine, yeast. An accompanying dessert quality of baked rum and banana bread, cinnamon, mace, and decided ginger. There is some alcohol heat and the beer flattens to an apricot syrup as it hit the throat in the back.

Poured a blondish, reddish amber with a very nice head which had amazing retention. Also produced some of the best and most consistent lacing I've ever seen, certainly the best I've seen from a Belgian ale. Smell was of dark cherries, grapes, currants, a deep molasses, apples, fig, apricot, cinammon, a variety of spices I couldn't quite put my finger on more due to my lack of spice knowledge than anything, caramel, all completely distinguishable and yet not at all overpowering. Definitely one of the highlights of this brew was its virtually one-of-a-kind ability to maintain complexity AND mellowness, nothing at all was overpowering about this ale and yet it was likewise in no way underwhelming. This carried over from the aroma to the taste; slight grain, but mostly a wonderful cherry, molasses, apple spicy quality. Some hints of cocoa in there as well. Hoppy bitterness and some alcoholic quality showed through upon swallowing, again somehow completely balancing with all the other flavors for an incredible smoothness. Mouthfeel was a wonderful fizz due to the incredible bubble retention throughout the experience. A surpirsingly drinkable brew as well. Wow, just amazing.","RidiculedDisplay","Beers"

The nose was subtly spicy (pepper, saffron), and fruity (apples, pears) with a tinge of earthy yeast, which was hard to keep in the little bottle. The taste was a revelation of lightly sweet and sour fruit flavors with a good deal of spiciness and some woody and herbal bitterness. The body felt oh-so-light and airy, and there was no hint at all of the 10% ABV. In the blink of an eye the glass was empty.

Sherry and brown sugar surge upward, and the brighter tropical notes are suppressed. Figs and molasses, with drier walnut nuttiness. This is a malt bath that hasn't radically changed since it was fresh and could easily go another 5-10 yeast.
