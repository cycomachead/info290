4.09,7.3,3.75,4,4.25,4,4,"Pours a dark, murky, medium brown producing 2+ fingers of moderately lasting, tan, frothy head that leaves nice strings & rings of lacing. Aroma pumpernickel, dark fruits, roast, molasses, faint cocoa & floral hop tones. Taste is similar but more robust with cherry, coriander, hints of anise, cloves & more cocoa than in the nose. Finishes very peppery/spicy with a chocolate cherry cordial, molasses, coriander aftertaste. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, medium carbonation, silky/creamy but with a light spice bite in the finish.","mothmanscott","Apr 01, 2015"

3.98,4.5,4,4,4,3.75,4,"O: A nicely layered American-made BSDA with plenty going on. Drinks very easily for being 8.3%, with the alcohol being hidden mostly by the yeast and complexity. Definitely worth picking up if you're into BSDAs, as it's interesting to compare to the Belgians","BEERMILER12","Mar 29, 2015"

4.24,11.3,4,4.25,4.25,4.25,4.25,"Poured a dark red with about a finger of off white foam. Good amount of effervescence. Smells of toasted grain, prune/raisin, hint of vanilla. Tastes malty, sweet forward without being overpowering, dark fruit (prune/fig), nice mid note twang, almost metallic taste, bit of oaky, vanilla notes and transitions a pretty clean finish. Carbonation more appreciable as it warms, as is the complexity of the flavors. Medium bodied and very smooth. Well balanced overall. Purchased in a pack of four – good price point for a solid and tasty beer. ABV well hidden. It reminded me a bit of Three Philosophers – another great beer.","ThaneMcC","Mar 27, 2015"

Aroma of fresh and dried dark stone fruit, particularly plums, sweet caramel malt, Belgian yeast. Flavor follows with semi sweet dark stone fruit, caramel malt, light Belgian yeast and spicing, hints of vanilla. Medium bodied with nice carbonation. A quite nice domestic take on the Belgian strong dark style with some dubbel characteristics. Enjoyable. 21st Amendment beer seems to be uneven, probably due to the fact that they are brewed at different locations, I've had one canned beer months apart that were alternatively great and truly awful.

Aroma consists of dry figs with quite a bit of residual sugar and some caramelized malt. Taste is also dominated by caramelized malt with too much residual sugar and some dry figs. Body is about average with good carbonation and light apparent alcohol. I thought this one was lacking balance with too much residuals sugar. It could be my mind playing tricks but I prefer my Belgian ale bottle conditioned not in cans.","Phyl21ca","Aug 18, 2013"

Aromas of molasses, banana, clove, pear, fig, cinnamon, allspice, dark bread, candi sugar, oak, pepper, and yeast spiciness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity. Taste of prune, brown sugar, fig, dark bread, toast, cinnamon, clove, ripe banana, oak, candi sugar, earth, and yeast spiciness. Lingering notes of dark fruit, brown sugar, dark bread, toast, candi sugar, clove, cinnamon, banana, earth, oak, and yeast spices on the finish for a good bit. Solid flavor balance and good complexity; a touch too bready and spicy; with zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a creamy, slick, and lightly prickly mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a very good Belgian strong dark ale. Nice complexity and solid flavor balance; and very smooth to sip on. I enjoyed this quite a bit.","superspak","Dec 13, 2012"

The taste is definitely dark fruit coupled with moderate carbonation and a hint of fig. The alcohol is pretty well hidden in the taste. A bit of spice also came out, specifically cinnamon. The body is a little lighter than expected, but very pleasant. This is definitely an easy Belgian style brew to drink and if not for the alcohol I would.

Maintained excellent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, red wine, spice, dark fruit, and plum. The flavor was of sweet malt, fruit, grape, spices, dark fruit, and subtle dark chocolate. It had a light feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a pretty decent brew. This one really reminded me a lot of a more toned down red wine when it came to the aromas given off here. There was a nice spice character here that was very similar to red wine as well. The addition of the dark fruit profile helped to balance this one out. The alcohol flavor was non-existant for me as the dark fruit and spices seemed to cover it up quite nicely. Definitely worth your time to try if you see it in your area.","thagr81us","Jul 16, 2012"

Small dots and streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of toasted malt, dark fruits, vanilla, brown sugar, and some woody aromas. Taste is of malt, prunes/figs, vanilla, brown sugar, alcohol, and a dry woody flavor on the finish. There is a slight hint of spice bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel.

Served in a ball-stem goblet, a hazy, dark, reddish-brown color with a small off-white head. Aroma of bready malts, caramel, soft fruits and spice. Taste was a bit muted at first, but fleshed out a bit mid-palate onward. Caramel and candi-like sugars, bready, cinnamon and spice, and more of the soft, indistinct fruit I got on the nose, hints of cola and some phenol. Medium-bodied, fairly chewy, some alcohol warmth.

It's a tangy sweet, and I'm delighted that it's not that dark-candied sugar so prevalent in other BSDAs. The feel is SO light for what I thought would be kind of a thick and chewy, Belgian yeast-dominated beer. In addition to that cinnamon and vanilla, there's only a slight Belgian twang with almost a cherry almond finish. It's like a light dessert, yet thin enough for an aperitif. In sum, it's probably the best beer I've had from the brewers at 21st Amendment.","marvin213","Mar 18, 2012"

Aromas are strong and sweet, with a nose heavy in fig and dates, with some boozey kicks. Some light spicing and rich, heavy malt, also. Flavors are rich, with a roasted, tangy caramel sweetness, as well as some dark fruit highlights of date, fig, and raisins. Some very subtle spicing throughout, with hints of clove and all spice. The aftertaste is tangy and slightly boozey, with all of the dark fruit sweetness carrying through into the finish. A slow, smooth transition over the palate leads to a somewhat abrupt, clean finish. Slightly cloying at the very end, this is a decent Belgian Strong, and I think it's the first one I've had in a can. Very interesting.","GarthDanielson","Feb 07, 2012"

Quite a bit of solventy alcohol, tannic woodyness and sharp bitterness prevent anything from shunning through. Medium bodied, appropriate carbonation. The listed ingredients made me very interested in trying this beer, but when they are hard to pinpoint under some harsh notes, it makes for a disappointing beer.","rfgetz","May 03, 2011"

Though alcohol is not extremely well-hidden, it actually adds to the beer and gives it a bit more depth of flavor.

The flavor starts off quite sweet and malty. Not sugary as such, but a bit sweet. Moderately balanced by a roasted maltiness and some warming alcohol. Dried fruits picking up in the flavor as well, along with a bit of Belgian yeast in the finish. There is also a tart fruit note in the finish, almost like a good kriek, albeit much more subtle.

Mouthfeel is on the full side, not a lot of effervescence, with a fairly dry finish. Certainly the best BSDA I've had in a can, but I was a bit perplexed to see this was contract brewed in Maryland.

It smells to me of banana, coriander, cinnamon, and brown sugar. The taste however is mainly of the banana and clove from the Belgian yeasts used. There is a booze flavor to it that can be detected through the clove. The best part of the flavor is definitely the aftertaste which comprises of mainly a marshmallow flavor. When combined with the caramel and chocolate malts it gives it an aftertaste that seems almost to be like a s'more. This is really a very tasty brew and even at it's higher ABV, I feel that it's rather smooth and easily drinkable.","Vdubb86","Aug 16, 2010"

Cinnamon. That's what I'm smelling, but it's faint. Rich malts and dark fruits dominate my pallet on this. A caramel sweetness is present and it finishes with just a little spiciness from the cinnamon and a touch vanilla. This is very rich and the flavors are nicely layered.

This is a full bodied, Belgian dark, with lots of ABV, wooden and oaken notes, lots of spices, lots of candied sugars and probably some brown sugar too. This is a really malted up affair. There are slighly booze soaked fig or raisin notes, there are almost some nutty flavors coming through too. There is a nice dash of vanilla, although I'm not getting much cinnamon as the label proclaims. The oaky almost cherrywood flavors are the most pronounced. This is a really fine beer.

The aroma was heavy on malts and fruits - bread and toffee, raisins and figs, earthy, slight alcohol, brown sugar and cocoa. Sweet toffee flavour up front, spicy notes appear mid-palate along with dried fruits with a fair bit of alcohol and grain character bringing up the rear. It's not immediately clear to me whether the flavours are just subtle, or are a little thin when compared to the aroma, but it's pretty mild tasting overall. Full bodied with very fine carbonation, alcohol warmth, decent texture. Not bad, but a little underwhelming.

With a big fruity character, there's also some cherry juice and a mild tartness. Oak and vanilla appear mid-palate with a moderate grainy astringency. Quite cola-like, this is drying on the finish with a blend of cherry juice and figs, this is not particularly exciting.

Lots of different things going on here, sweet, oaky, with a touch of vanilla and some very soft vanilla. Not picking up on too much figs, but there's a definitely a dark fruity background. The alcohol is a bit hot, however. I think this one will actually age pretty well as some of the additional flavorings added will fade and the alcohol will mellow.

I'd say it's roughly in the style of a dubbel, though its 8.3% ABV pushes it toward being a Belgian Dark Strong Ale, like the Chimay Grande Reserve or Rochefort 10. It pours a deep, rich brown, with a rocky tan head. The aroma speaks of the spices and the figs, perhaps with a touch of alcohol. On the tongue, it is gratifyingly complex, with the dark figs very evident. Perhaps a little too evident, as they make the beer seem a bit too sweet.

The flavor is more of the same with dark fruit and vanilla with some sour aspects, but not quite as much sourness as was in the aroma. The vanilla is strong in the aftertaste.

Ah, a can of Monk's Blood, and there's something all too appealing about craking open an aluminum tin of high-grade craft brew. Typically dark-ish and unassuming in its look, no head to speak of, with a withdrawn but unusal nose of grape soda and gummy cola bottles. There's a neat prune taste in the background which gives it an overall Dr Pepper quality, like a Beer Soda theme that could benefit from a little more carbonation. Does it go well with the wasabi peanuts and straight-out-the-package deli ham slice I'm ""pairing"" it with? How should I know, and who the hell are you to ask?","Rizow","Jan 09, 2010"

2.92,-23.4,3.5,4,2.5,3.5,2,"Taste: Like a black forest cake. Initially sour but then becomes quite sweet with some cherry and ripe fruits along with brow sugar, but then this is partially balanced out by bitterness. However, a third, very interesting wave of dark chocolate dries the palette up nicely. Medium body. Finish lingers for a very long time and is really delicious, chocolate, bitter, and cherry.

But Brothers Nicolas and O'Sullivan had other plans. Working in the brewhouse all day, they were forced to repeat the same old recipes the elder monks had unveiled years before. They needed a little diversion. And found it in the cellar with a fresh must they put on the beer and the way they enjoyed it. Brother Nicolas (or 'Nico' to his close friend) brought some hand rolled cigars. O'Sullivan, the outspoken one, broke the vow of silence by spinning a remix of some Gregorian chants. Together, they'd throw down a couple nice hands of Texas Hold 'Em and savor the handcrafted brew they'd created in secret. Everything was good. Or so it seemed. But deep in his heart, Nico knew they were delving into the 'dark side' of beer. Next thing you knew, they'd be skipping Lent. Then one night, they'd face the Judgement for their actions with a hard knock on the door. Outside, the Abbot and elders would be holding stones in the air. A threat the brothers were sure would lead to the spilling of Monk's Blood. Belgian-style Dark Ale brewed with cinnamon, vanilla, oak chips, and dried figs."" Whew!","woodychandler","Jan 04, 2010"

Alcohol definitely shows through towards the end, carbonation was low but overall mouthfeel felt a bit flat.

This one held up a lot better in my opinion, although I'm not sure how Belgian-y it was - seemed a lot more like a US stout with a little extra sugar, but that's just me. It was mostly what you'd expect - dark brew with a solid head, then lots of chocolate, dried fruit, and molasses. Solid, if perhaps unexceptional (not a Gouden Carolus by any means). Would probably get it again, though, given the remarkably cheap price tag.","soupyman10","Dec 29, 2009"

The aroma is vanilla, cherries, caramel, cognac and some sweet fruitiness, which may be from the figs but it's more sweet than figgy. The flavor is just a bit too sweet, throwing the whole package off a bit for my tastes. I'm not saying it's terrible, but I think the beer could have really benefited from more attenuation.

There is no hint of roast or of hop based bitterness leaving the back of the palate blank when confronted with the sweetness from the alcohol and malt up front. Beer seems to be disconnected.

The can pours a dark reddish brown beer, with about two fingers of white heading. Sort of looks like blood too. Has a red wine like nose, and something slightly sour, or vinegar like. Also I get some touches of herbs or spices. Taste is grainy, slightly sour in the middle, and ends on a note that makes it almost resemble a Flanders Red. Mouthfeel is a bit on the thin side. This one does not feel like it has a weight of 8.50. Drinkability is not too shabby, I suppose I was just expecting a beer that was closer to a Dubbel than a Belgian Strong Dark. The third release from these guys in cans is not a bad beer by any means. Hopefully they will continue to can new beers, and send them out here. Cheers","jamie2dope","Dec 13, 2009"

It's very clear you can see right through it pretty easily. The aroma is a malty candy smell and it's pretty big. I can smell it a couple of feet away from my beer. I also pick up some alcohol raisin notes. My initial taste I get a fig, plum character also I picked up on a nut like flavor as well. Subsequent tastings a yeasty or a doughy feel mixed in with a brown sugar like quality is also present as well as a mild floral hoppy note but it is really in the back ground. The finish is a slight cloying taste with a mild bitterness or alcohol bite. Overall, I really find myself enjoying this beer a lot.

The nose is loaded with darker ripe fruits, cherries and figs come to mind as well as raisins and light rum. Flavorful and quite tasty, with more dark fruit notes, raisins, figs, dark grapes, vanilla and perhaps a wiff of the advertized (on the can) cinnamon. Great winter brew, pleasant and easy drinking.

Aroma is fairly strong and sweet, dark fruit, figs, yeast, lots of sugars. Mild tangy sourness to the nose but little presence of hops or whatever oak aging occurred. Flavor throughout is dominated by tangy and sweet notes, very little alcohol presence. Flavor starts on front of palate with sweet dark fruits, figs, candi sugar, raisins, etc before becoming drier and more tangy toward the finish with a light hop bite. I also pick up a little cinnamon in the finish, but little in the way of other spices. Mouthfeel is medium full, with low carbonation, probably more carbonation would help clean up the finish.
