Super easy drinking while having the body of an oatmeal stout.  Really good.  Belgian stout indeed!","cosmicevan","Nov 25, 2014"

4.13,2.2,4.25,3.75,4.25,4.25,4.25,"BOD 156/14.  Pours almost black with a quite a bit of dark ruby.  Normal head with above normal lacing and retention.  Light nose of chocolate, Belgian yeast, candi sugar and hints of dark fruit and roast.  Medium bodied with a nice slick texture that hints at creaminess.  Above normal carbonation with effervescence in the middle and finish.  The excellent flavor profile is of reasonable intensity, quite complex and exceptionally balanced.  It begins with semisweet dark chocolate over a very mild roast character.  As the effervescent middle begins, the chocolate fades to candi sugar sweetness and more of the roast character is noted.  As this sweetness fades, dark fruit notes come to the forefront.  The finish is smooth, but has dry characteristics, and a bit of hop flavor and bitterness in addition to hints of coffee.  A slight dark chocolate note lingers.  The alcohol (7.5%) is totally hidden.","tillmac62","Nov 14, 2014"

Not as much Belgian influence as I expected, but just enough so as to not discredit the claim of ""Belgian Style Stout"".","TheSixthRing","Jul 28, 2014"

Despite my very slow, gentle pour, I still garnered a finger of foamy, light-tan head with decent retention. Color was a deep, dark reddish-brown (SRM= > 27, < 34) with good clarity and mahogany highlights. Nose was reminiscent of Belgian chocolate - sweet, but not cloying, plus the yeast gave it a slightly vinous quality. Interesting. Mouthfeel was creamy. I have to say, there was an initial fusel alcohol heat with this one. It mellowed out to create a semi-sweet chocolatiness, but when coupled with the yeasty flavors, I am glad that it is not classified as a ""Stout"" on here. It was Stout-like, but at the same time, it was not a Stout. Finish was semi-dry with it being a battle between the chocolate malt and the yeast plus alcohol for supremacy. I was glad to have been able to drink and review one, but it is not the sort of thing that I would normally buy for myself.","woodychandler","Jul 20, 2014"

Head has great retention and leaves some nice lacing. Aroma is an interesting blend of traditional roast notes and hints of Belgian yeast. The flavor is interesting, as well. The roasted notes from the dark malt are significantly mellowed out by the Belgian yeast. There is a nice interplay between the two. The weight of the beer is a little lighter than a more traditional stout but with the lighter flavors it matches well. This is an excellent twist on a traditional stout and Belgian dark.","delta490","Apr 19, 2014"

It has a great lack of complexity and yeast character. It does quite well as a stout, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for that. I feel that the minor contribution of Belgian yeast flavor does add enough to make it more than your standard stout, so those looking for a delicious stout will undoubtedly agree that this is an outstanding beer.","teromous","Apr 14, 2014"

The snifter definitely accentuated the smells and it was a divine aroma of dark chocolate coffee and maybe BlackBerries. I was just slightly less whelmed by the taste which had more of ground-up cigarettes to it. I was underwhelmed by the finish which was a little rough. Overall this was an okay beer I can't say that I'm going to go out and get another one especially considering the price.","SteveTheDog","Jan 25, 2014"

Aroma of yeast, candi sugar, some chocolate, spice. Flavor follows with a similar profile: candi sugar and yeast, some light chocolate, sweet and spice finish. This tastes closer to a Belgian Strong Dark ale than any stout, but good in that vein. Medium mouthfeel with medium carbonation, rather light for a stout. Overall this was a pretty good beer but not one to go for if you’re looking for a creamy stout. Definitely Belgian inspired.","BMMillsy","Dec 29, 2013"

This is delicate and can leave you wanting something more out of it. The feel on this beer is where it really lets me down. The body could be more fuller and smoother for being a stout. Maybe it is, but the carbonation makes sure your attention is more on the poppy sensation on your palate. This is very polished and well crafted. Just some of my pet peeves at work. This one just isn't all that entertaining in my opinion. This ale was still worthy of my time.","Shroud0fdoom","Nov 03, 2013"

Pours nearly pitch black color with a 2 finger fairly dense tan head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of dark chocolate, roasted malt, cocoa, pear, apple, raisin, clove, pepper, toast, floral, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of malt and fruity/spicy yeast notes; with good strength. Taste of dark chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, pear, apple, clove, pepper, raisin, toast, light char, herbal, floral, and yeast earthiness. Lingering notes of dark chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, pear, apple, clove, pepper, raisin, toast, light char, herbal, floral, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and complexity of roasted malt and fruity/spicy yeast flavors; with a nice malt/spiciness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a crisp, moderately prickly, and lightly chalky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice Belgian stout style. All around nice balance and complexity of roasted malt and fruity/spicy yeast flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Sep 06, 2013"

The nose comprises light dark chocolate and very light roasted malts. Everything is too vague and ethereal to get a good read from. The taste brings in more of the same, though everything is quite stronger, and there's the added bonuses of some very light anise and a hint of a spice medley. The body is a stolid medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a fluid feel. Overall, despite a meek smell and a slightly thin body, this stuff ain't half bad. As the prototypical Belgian stout in the States, I can easily appreciate the effort.","TMoney2591","May 09, 2013"

Aromas of roast coffee, both bitter and warm, with a meaty heartiness and touch of smoke. Some funk from the yeast, too. Flavors of dark fruit sweetness, with plum and date in the backbone, and a coffee highlight, bitter and roasted. Very well blended. Roasty and bitter aftertaste, with a touch of campfire. Light, filmy, slightly effervesced finish, with a roasty linger. Tasty brew.","GarthDanielson","Apr 16, 2013"

Since the carbonation was somewhat high, it helped to take the bite off of the stickiness from the sugar and made this relatively easy to down.

The taste follows soft and nondescript allowing the flavors from the nose to flow over the tongue. If you really rough it up there's a sour note from the burnt candi sugar. What really stands out about this beer is the soft mouthfeel rolling smoothly to an easy finish with no harsh carbination or alcohol burn despite the lingering head.","templar316","Feb 04, 2013"

I can smell chocolate, caramel, and spicy wheat with a bit of pepper and a hint of oxidation. Light sweet fruits mixed with a bit of yeasty funk and fruitiness round out the nose well. The flavor is chocolate and caramel up front followed by a huge ashy and then oxidized taste that seems odd. Light fruit and yeasty phenols sweep in to mop that up then a chocolatey roasty ashy flavor lingers long into the finish of every sip. Medium body with a high level of carbonation and a sweet bubbly mouthfeel. This one isn't bad, it actually grew on me through the glass, but I'm not sure I'd grab it again.","johnnnniee","Dec 21, 2012"

The rich body holds up perfectly to the carbonation creating a truly layered flavor experience. So many flavors hide itself in this dark brew including bananas, hazelnuts, plums, and leather.

The body was a moderate thickness with very low carbonation. The alcohol was also really well hidden. The finish lasted awhile with the roasted malts that were apparent in the taste.

Maintained phenomenal lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, roasted malt, dark fruit, wood, fruit, banana, and subtle spice. The flavor was of sweet malt, dark chocolate, roasted malt, fruit, dark fruit, wood, subtle alcohol, and subtle smoke. It had a medium feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a pretty decent brew. There was quite a bit going on in this one that definitely kept the senses guessing on what to expect next. The aroma on this one was definitely the highlight of this one though as it was quite inviting and very nicely balanced with a nice roastiness and fruit profile going on. The flavor wasn’t too far behind, but the dark chocolate profile going on definitely added just a touch more roastiness than was needed in my opinion.

Nice aroma of cocoa, coffee, dark malt and dark fruit. Flavorful dark and roasted malt, dark fruits, cocoa; almost like a spiked malted milk. Belgian yeast and spicing is present and well integrated. Slight hop kick at the finish. A complex, great tasting ale or stout with a very nice flavor progression. Medium to creamy body. Impressive.","LiquidAmber","Mar 18, 2012"

Smell is of dark malt and Belgian yeast. Taste is of dark roasted malt, burnt coffee beans, and slight yeast flavors. This beer has a higher level of carbonation with a nice crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good Belgian style take on a stout.","UCLABrewN84","Feb 05, 2012"
4.25,5.2,4,4,4.5,4.5,4,"Served up in a snifter this beer is nearly black in the glass the head is thin likely due to a soft pour but the dark khaki colored bubbles around the edge of the glass don't appear to be going anywhere anytime soon. I'll agree with others in that the smell is a bit heavy on the malt for a belgian strong dark ale. However, I'm not going to fault the beer too heavily because i think it works. Malt is the focus in the nose with roasted and chocolate and dark coffee coming through. Below that there is some dark fruit and yeasty esters. The taste follows the smell quite closely with the malt focus clear. Coffee, bittersweet chocolate, roasted malt a bit of caramel and then some bitterness and the yeast. The carbonation is high and bitterness through hops appears relatively low but the coffee like character adds additional bittering. The finish is quite dry and lingers with the coffee character last to leave. Overall this is somewhat of a mix of styles rather than a pure belgian strong dark or I suppose you could just call it an interesting take on that style. Quite good and definitely recommended.","fank2788","Feb 05, 2012"

Listed as a ""Belgian stout"" I didn't completely know what to expect, but the ""Belgian dark ale"" label makes a little more sense after drinking it. Aroma was rich with dark malts, leather and charcoal, with touches of fruit in the background. The taste was similar, and quite complex, with nearly 100% dark maltiness up front, giving way to the leather and charcoal sensed in the aroma, hints of peat and of Belgian yeast, cocoa, and dark fruits coming through near the end. Very interesting. Heavier-medium mouthfeel, rich, and drinkable enough to make me desire another glass right after the first.","Rifugium","Nov 05, 2011"

The other flavors of some soft Belgian Yeast and a little spice come in after the metallic flavor fades by mid glass. The mouthfeel had some decent carbonation to it.

Kind of unsure of itself, honestly, like it could have gone one of many directions a little bit further. Still an awesome brew, and maybe it's just that lack of commitment to one ostentatious note that makes it such a stable, staple beer. Really, I just shouldn't drink it alongside the Odyssey.

What impressed me most about this was the full flavored yet delicate mouthfeel that prominently displays its roasted coffee and cocoa malt notes without losing its smooth texture.

As I was tasting this I kept thinking I had already tasted a similar beer, and finally remembered the taste from Basha by Stone/BrewDog. The style of this beer is a Belgian Stout but the body being as thin as it is, and the hops being fairly prevalent, make it almost a Black IPA. Belgian Black IPA is what Basha is.

Very nice blend and a very pleasant, near velvetty feel with subtle carbonation. This has a beautiful grain hop mix that is pretty drinkable and just pleasantly tasty.

A solid yeast aroma as well and a little bit of orange/citric feel (hints of bread, figs, black cherry and maple are all scents one might pick up). Typical meal in a bottle as a medium-bodied beer passes that is smooth and creamy and yet also has a stickiness on the back end. Has a large sweet malt base of cocoa, vanilla, caramel, candy sugar. Also a roasted, touch of coffee, malt base for balance so it not only has sweetness but a dry edge around the beer. A nice citric sharp twang along with some fruit falvors like black cherry and a noticeable orange taste (possible grapeskin taste as well).

I do find a hint of belgian yeast in the nose. The taste is almost like a Black IPA with belgian yeast. Dark carmel malts with a hint of a hop bitterness. Then the belgian yeast adds to a complexity. Mouthfeel is a little thin in body for my likes to such a dark brew. But that really doesn't take much away from this being a really good dark ale.","whoneeds8","Oct 26, 2010"

The head is a delicate, silky tannish color. Yeast, malts, cocoa, and spices highlight the well-balanced and inviting aroma. The body is rather bold but the fluffy head tickles the lips. The taste is a well-balanced combination of malts, wheat, and yeast with a little hoppiness around the edges to give it a little zing. A wonderfully well-rounded beer.","puboflyons","Aug 14, 2010"

There was a nice combination of chocolate, cocoa, and roasted barley, but the mouthfeel was a lot more smoother than a normal stout. Also, the abv was in a manageable range, so it was an easy beer to drink. I like this beer because it satisfied the stout lover in me, but hit the spot for a nice dark ale with my meal.

That said, I am not sure how much I will be drinking this one in the future as there isn't a whole lot about it that stands out to me. I believe that I paid around $10 for this bottle, which is about the same price as a St Bernardus Abt12.

Brewed with German 2-row, oats, torrified wheat, roast malts, dark candi sugar and their house Belgian strain; bottle conditioned. It pours near solid black, with an inch of almost fluffy, tan head that doesn't leave much lacing. Nice chocolatey roastiness in the nose, steely, with a drop of licorice. It gives the impression of an oatmeal or Irish stout. Similar in flavor, but it tastes a bit sharp, minerally?, with prevalent green hops that impart a medium bitterness. Not incredibly Belgian at first, but after some time to breathe it picks up a bit. It has a well-attenuated medium body that at times pushes to thick, with very fine carbonation and a dry finish. The beer comes across as a mishmash of styles at first, but it does improve a bit. Good, but not great, just make sure not to drink this one too cold.","mmmbeer","Nov 30, 2009"

Sticky tan head, decent but not outstanding retention. Smell is superstrong yeast - like a burnt yeast, in keeping with the stout theme. Taste just like it smells - sweet like a milk stout, yeasty like a belgian, with a slight roasty overtone bringing the two together. It really is almost more like a belgian strong dark, but it lacks the complexity you like to see in the style. Slight roastiness lingers on the palate, but it's like drinking a Coffee Coolada compared to the real thing - kind of artificial sweet, meant to approximate the real thing, but not to be the real thing. Overall medium body, definitely on the lighter side for a stout. No real depth to the roastiness at all, like imitation instant coffee is to real coffee. Almost tastes watered down. Drinkability is OK, not really hampered by the alcohol content, but by the way the yeast and stouty bitterness merge - not offensive, but a bit disconcerting.

I was not terribly taken with the nose. Husky, corn-like, slighty witte-like nose belying the yeasty belgianness of the beer. It has almost the same exact nose as the Allagash Witte. Meh. The taste however, was infinitely more to my liking. Had the rich coffee flavors of a stout mixed with the cherry sweetness native to the dark Belgian ales. Very delicious.

Bitterness was average, making its presence known but not getting in the way of the malt. Not overly sweet though, with a bit of alcohol towards the end.

I prefer a somewhat lighter color for the style but again this beer does not seem to be trying to compete with classic Belgian Strong Darks and certainly looks nice in the glass. The smell is sweet but well-balanced. You can certainly smell the Belgian candy sugars. There are notes of vanilla, oak and earthy Belgian yeasts. It's a refined scent but not exactly my cup of tea at this point in my tasting life. I can imagine warming to this beer in time. The taste gives further signs of the care put into the beer. This beer certainly spent some time in fine casks. There are a lot of understated sweet notes and both rich chocolatey malt and perfectly balanced hops. However, it just doesn't quite add up for me. It's too sweet and too refined. It doesn't help that the feel is so light. I don't think anything about this beer is unintentional, so I'll just put it down to difference in taste. I'm sure that the most people will enjoy this beer and it would certainly make a good gift. It's a bit like a good dessert wine. I just don't happen to be a fan of that kind of thing. I aspire to like it even more, but this is my review for now.","popery","Dec 05, 2008"

Head dissipated into a thin skim that coalesced around the perimeter of the glass; lacing was spotty and sparse. Nose presented with dark fruity esters and cocoa with a trace of alcohol. Taste consistent with nose; however, a light roasted coffee character is revealed in the mouth with a bit of char at the finish.

All in all I was pretty impressed with Allagash Black and would drink it again for sure.","Blaise","Jun 11, 2008"

The smell is an ever-so-slightly roasted malt chocolate, NECCO wafer aroma. Adequately carbonated, a small tingle of hops and alcohol, the mouth feel is light-medium bodied. The flavor and the nose are quite similar. There is a subtle tangy character of the mouth that's keeping things interesting. I guess i shouldn't be as shocked as i am about the enormity of acceptable interpretations of the ""Belgian Strong Dark Ale"". I've come to expect an earthy yeast component and a dark fruit character, neither of which was predominant in this sample. Goes to show...keep your expectations in check.

It tasted like dark chocolate and creamy coffee hops, along with wild yeast. As the beer warmed, the yeast flavor faded, and the coffee flavor really came out. It was watery with slight carbonation and a mildly bitter chocolate aftertaste. Overall this is probably my favorite Belgian style, great to drink by fireside, but this particular beer missed some of it potential.

This is very effervescent and it brings the cloves out right away, then giving away to the chocolate/coffee smoothness. There is a bitterness component here too but the dry finish gets rid of that quickly. A very unique beer, not a stout, not a belgian strong dark ale, I would call it a dark triple.

4.25,5.2,4,4,4.5,3.5,4.5,"Out of a 750ml corked and caged bottle. Pours an almost near black color with an average tan head that dissipated quickly into a ring around the glass. The smell is of Beligan candi sugar, light fruit, light roasted malt and mocha. The taste starts off with a nice Beligan dark fruit esters and candi sugar. The dark fruit esters are not as pronounced as a normal BSDA because they are quickly matched with a roasted malt/coffee balance. If find the taste to be quite unique and enjoyable. The feel is moderate but lighter than expected. The carbonation is a bit more fizzy than I expected as well. The brew finishes well and has nice balance. I didn't know what to expect with this one. I does seem to fit the Beligan stout label. A must try.","Gmann","Jan 19, 2008"
4.47,10.6,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"This is a great blend of an American/English style with a Belgian brewing technique. It doesn't taste forced at all. It's like this has been the main tradition for centuries. It's a Belgian Strong Dark Ale by name only, it's more of a Belgian Strong Stout. I think this is one of the better ultra-dark Belgian ales. Recommended.","BeerSox","Jan 19, 2008"
4.08,1,4,3.5,4.5,4,4,"M&D - smooth and fill bodied at first, then followed up by that aforementioned alcohol burn, this is pretty good, at least off tap, i would like to try a bottle of this","sinstaineddemon","Jan 15, 2008"
3.95,-2.2,4,4,4,3.5,4,"This is definitely a good beer, although not one of the best I've had. It's a unique combination of flavors for sure, but nothing really stands out, and there's not really anything new here. Regardless, it's still very good and I recommend it.","vtfan77","Jan 13, 2008"
3.56,-11.9,4,3,3.5,5,3.5,"This is another interesting variety from Allagash coming in their 750ML bottles. This beer pours a very blackish color with a nice tan head that certainly retains. The beer doesn't lace particularly well. The appearance is quite good, but the smell diminishes the experience to a degree. You will definitely encounter earthy tones, coffee aromas, burnt or roasted grains, perhaps a bit of chocolate, and then something else not so pleasant. At first I thought it was like a stale soy sauce smell, but other reviewers call it a lactic aroma. I'll go along with that. It's not pleasant. The one characteristic of this beer is its incredible silky smoothness on the tongue. This is like drinking milk chocolate in terms of mouthfeel. The taste is quite tart and sharp in the finish. The mouthfeel is delightful and the mid sections give you that roasted maltiness that is pleasing, but then you come up against too strong an astringency that is off putting. The alcohol is warming and about right, but this beer just comes off as too sharp for the style. The beer is moderately carbonated, medium bodied, and just wonderful on the tongue. It's too bad that the flavor and aroma could not follow suit with the creamy consistency.","albern","Jan 13, 2008"
3.96,-2,4.5,3.5,4,3.5,4.5,"Overall, a damn fine beer from a fantastic brewery. If I were tasting it blind, I wouldn't have thought Belgian stout, I'd have thought coffee stout for sure. Well worth trying.","phisig137","Jan 12, 2008"
3.53,-12.6,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"D - the lactic aroma/flavor fades as it warms but this one just doesn't blend together the best.","brewcrew76","Jan 12, 2008"
4.03,-0.2,4.5,4,4,4,4,"definitely not a brew that bashes you upside the head and says this is the dominate note. this is a brew that confidently and quitely says there's a flavor to contemplate and savor in here!","barleywinebrewer","Jan 11, 2008"
3.27,-19.1,3,3.5,3.5,2.5,3,"D - This beer really didn't work for me. Body was too weak, flavors were jumbled and didn't seem to compliment each other. Might need another taste, but seemed bad to me today.","SammyDavisJrJrJr","Jan 10, 2008"
4.25,5.2,4,4,4.5,3.5,4.5,"On tap at Deep Ellum in Allston, MA. Showed up an opaque black with a soft light-brown head that reduces reasonably quickly. A lot of creamy milk chocolate on the palate -- very rich and smooth. The mouthfeel was satiny smooth but without a lot of heft in its presence. Pretty drinkable -- like a serving of mocha iced coffee. Really didn't strike me as a Belgian-style ale -- I'm not totally sure how I'd categorize it. It was a strange one, but a highly enjoyable one nonetheless.","eberkman","Jan 10, 2008"
4.22,4.5,3.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,"The taste is of roasted malt and a lingering coffee aftertaste. The carbonation dances around the mouth with a crisp feel, not quite like a typical stout and I agree it's more of a dark Belgian ale, but it could certainly be a class of it's own.","deltatauhobbit","Jan 09, 2008"
3,-25.7,3.5,3.5,3,2.5,2.5,"It's black with a thin and rapidly dissipating chocolate milk colored head. - you can find a variety of lighter hues depending upon how you struggle to hold it up to various lights at various angles in various glasses. Pardon me for being cynical on that score. There is an aroma of roasted malts - some cocoa and black coffee with hints of phenols appropriate to Belgian ale yeasts interacting with ""a large addition of Belgian dark candi."" The flavor is roasty, acidic and bitter - the qualities that cause most people to insist on cream and sugar with their coffee. The mouth feel is thin with prickly carbonation that lifts the acidic coffee flavor to the roof of the mouth and up the nose through the back door in your throat. This may very well benefit from some aging, though not for too long. Maybe up to a year? As it warms up, the aroma becomes more stout-like, and the flavor more Belgian. Objectively speaking, this is an interesting study for my palette. Subjectively speaking, I'm not very fond of it, but don't worry, timtim is on his way here within 48 hours with a disorienting rave review.","dedrinker","Jan 04, 2008"
4.25,5.2,4,4,4.5,4.5,4,"good drinkability not a booze bomb, as this type of beer could be, and all the flavors remain in check. a complex in interesting beer.","kmo1030","Jan 03, 2008"
3.59,-11.1,3,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"I poured this big beer into my tumbler at 50 degrees. The beeer was certainly black with a big tan head that was impressive at first thenn fell away. Lacing was really nice also. The smell was thick of coffee. The taste was a little fruitty and had a roasted coffee taste that was good. I would buy this beer again.","Minkybut","Jan 02, 2008"
4.03,-0.2,4.5,4,4,4,4,"There are times where I wish certain breweries would brew a particular style of beer. This is one of those cases....never expected that Allagash would brew a stout. Poured in to my new Allagash goblet a chestnut brown, with a large tannish white head that has good retention. Many earthy aromas are in the smell, along with a faint milk chocolate. Taste continues on the milk chocolate note, with some buttery caramel, and a somewhat spicy bitter finish. Mouthfeel is somewhere between medium and large. Certainly an easy drinking beer here. Goes down silky smooth, and the alcohol is not in your face. Quite an interesting brew we have here. Has stout characteristics, yet falls outside the realm of anything the English or other American breweries have done with the style. Without a doubt this should be a style unto its own. Another great job from Allagash.","jamie2dope","Dec 23, 2007"
4.38,8.4,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"The mouth feel is light and this is very drinkable. I could easily see myself polishing off two or three of these 750s, except that they aren't cheap ($13.50 for the bottle). Absolutely recommended if you can find it.","jburks725","Dec 20, 2007"
4.35,7.7,4.5,4.5,4,5,4.5,"Pours black in color, with a soft, nutty, off-white head that fades, after a while, to a collar. The nose is that of a lactose-sweetened English stout, softened by Belgian yeast esters and phenols. Some chocolate or carafa malt also makes its way into the aroma, along with a nutty creaminess. On the palate, malt bitterness crops up first, then some fruity sweetness and cream stout kind of flavors at the mid-palate. The finish is full of yeasty flavors. Mouthfeel is what you'd expect from a Belgian/stout hybrid -- very smooth and slick on the palate, with alcohol that is just about imperceptible. Overall, this is a wonderful beer, and exactly the kind of genre-expanding efforts you'd want from the special line of Allagash beers. Well done.","geexploitation","Dec 16, 2007"
4.23,4.7,4.5,4,4.5,4,4,"Drinkability: This beer really is what it claims  a Belgian style stout. As such, I am at a loss to classify it given the BA categories. It has the sweetness and smoothness of a milk stout, but the sweetness comes largely from the Belgian yeast. So, since there is no Belgian stout style, for now I guess I will reluctantly place it under the Belgian strong dark ale category. Whatever you call it, this is one of the most drinkable stouts I have run across. I would down quite a few of these, without realizing it has a 7.5% APV, making it delicious and dangerous stuff. Congrats to the crew at Allagash for another wonderful creation.","Bassetdawg","Dec 13, 2007"
