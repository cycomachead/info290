4.1,1,4,4,4,4,4.5,"750 ml bottle into tulip glass, best before 1/28/2015. Pours crystal clear deep ruby red color with a 2 finger fairly dense khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of big raisin, plum, fig, pear, apple, banana, caramel, toast, biscuit, candi sugar, light chocolate, bubblegum, herbal, floral, light pepper, and yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of fruity/earthy yeast and dark malt notes; with great strength. Taste of raisin, plum, pear, apple, fig, banana, caramel, toast, biscuit, candi sugar, light chocolate, light bubblegum, pepper, herbal, floral, and yeast earthiness. Fair amount of earthy yeast spiciness on the finish; with lingering notes of raisin, plum, pear, apple, fig, banana, caramel, toast, biscuit, light chocolate, candi sugar, light bubblegum, light pepper, herbal, floral, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice complexity of fruity/earthy yeast and dark malt flavors; with a great malt/yeast flavor balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a smooth, crisp, and lightly slick/pricky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a excellent Belgian strong dark ale. All around great complexity and balance of fruity/earthy yeast and dark malt flavors; and very smooth and crisp to sip on for the ABV. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Apr 24, 2014"

3.86,-4.9,3.75,4,3.75,4.25,3.75,"A friend brought this 750ml ""Belgian brown"" back from Missouri last week. No dating indicated on bottle. Interesting ""trippy"" label. We consumed this beer from Rose and Crown Pub English nonic style glasses. The cork released with a loud ""pop"" almost propelling itself from my fingers as I broke it loose from its firm grasp of the bottle. Quite chill hazed and bronze in color with some red hues in the mix. Off white 2-3 finger bubbly head leaves behind large webbing of lace. Highly vinous but slightly sweet vinegar to the nose backed my nutty brown malt. Flavor is very fruity, sweet, and quite tart verging on sour. Toasted malt lingers but is overcome by the tartness. Really not much in the way of hop bitterness. There is an obvious woody oak character in the back of this beer. Carb is pleasant and somewhat silky and feel is full. 9% abv provides dryness and warmth. All this leads me to think of this as a Flanders red ale more than what I perceive as a Belgian Dark Strong. The abv and location of the brewery in extreme South Belgium just miles from France has much to do with this terminology as well. I feel this is probably a beer that should be savored slowly with a meal at the dinner table to fully appreciate it.","DelMontiac","Oct 17, 2013"

Complex flavour - plum and cherry notes are underscored by a finish of gentle acidity. It's malty and slightly sweet as well, with cookie dough and toasted nut. This hides the alcohol well on the palate. Medium-bodied with abundant carbonation. Feels light in the mouth, but not in the thin sort of way.

More sweet than sour for sure, but a subtle tartness keeps the sweet aspect (tempered by a delicious Belgian yeast strain) from ever becoming cloying. Cherries and yeast are the star of this show.

Taste holds some brown sugar, caramelized dark fruits with a relatively substantial alcohol punch. Lighter chocolate notes, and the mildest of metallic notes.

3.79,-6.7,2,3,4.5,3.5,4,"The beer pours a fairly deep brown, without creeping into black territory. There may be a hint of maroon in the color as well, and Nostradamus has faint amber highlights. The head is somewhere between bone and khaki, and a decent roughly two and a half fingers in height. The problem is that retention is below average ofr the style, and and lacing is 100% nonexistent... very disappointing. The nose is a bit weak, and all I can make out are notes of chocolate and some plums and figs. It doesn't smell bad, but I hope there's a bit more to the beer than that. Nostradamus is a bit of an odd duck for a BSDA flavor wise. It's possibly the cleanest tasting beer of the style I've ever tried in that flavors imparted by the yeast are kept to a minimal clove background note. A wonderful bouquet of malty notes provide the lion's share of flavor. There's a very smooth milk chocolate presence, which I guess shouldn't be surprising given that the bottle identifies itself as a Belgian brown ale. There's also the expected sweet dark fruits showing up, noticeably so. Caramel plays more of a background note. There's also a slight warming sensation from alcohol, but Nostradamus stops well short of being boozy. If the chocolate was a little bit less overpowering I'd probably give it a 5, but as is it's just short of perfection. The body is very good, manages not to become to heavy, which is always a concern with such a big, malt forward beer. Carbonation is a bit uneven though, it explodes when it first hits the front of my tongue, but fizzles out quick, so that the beer starts edging into being syrupy by the end of the sip. It's a shame Nostradamus isn't much of a looker, because it's a pretty tasty beer, and a nice changeup from the standard BSDA.","axeman9182","Dec 26, 2010"

The beer has a dark copper color. t is translucent and has a thin tan head that dissipated quickly. After a few minutes there was hardly any head left. There is a robust caramel aroma. I am also picking up on some slight pine tones as well. The beer has a sweet flavor, but nothing overwhelming or indicative of the higher ABV. I found this up front malt quality to be very good, but was incredibly impressed with the finish. There is a slightly sour taste in the finish and after taste. It is reminiscent of a Flemish Brown. I found it to be totally unexpected and very tasty. For a strong dark ale, there is a rather light body to this beer. It also has a lot of carbonation, but not enough to distract from the flavor. There are some welcome estery alcohol vapors in my mouth after I swallow. As I seem to find many Belgian beers, this one is very drinkable. I can see the sour aspects being a limiting factor for some drinkers, but personally, I could go for multiple rounds.","ToasterChef","Feb 25, 2010"

A medium-bodied beer that made my face turn sour for a second, but then the beer flowed over my tongue smooth and a little creamy. Even finished sweet. A fruity taste along with sweetness with citric notes and touches of heavier fruits. Slightly dry hopping along with spices balance the beer out and complement its finish, although they're might just a touch of alkie burn.

Subtle peppery spice, alcohol & faint yeast round out the experience as it finishes plenty dry and warming.

Taste I did love though, I think this is the first beer I've had where I genuinely dislike the smell but love the taste.

Brightly carbonated, giving the mouth feel a lighter texture. The 9.5% ABV is really well hidden in the taste, but there is some heat on the way down. Really quite drinkable.

The head dissipates slowly, eventually forming just a thin film after drinking for a while. The smell is complex, moderately malty with nutty and bread influences and a hint of brown sugar or caramel. Yeast is also apparent that is somewhat earthy, and there is a delayed truffle aroma. Very interesting. The taste is fairly sweet malt with some sourness and a hint of the earthiness noted in the aroma. The aftertaste picks up a little bitterness and enforces the earthy malt of the IF. TTh aftertaste is relatively long-lived and finishes up a little sour. The mouth feel is medium bodied and a little chewy with active to fizzy carbonation, giving a little bite on the tongue. The finish is moderately alcoholic. This is a tasty, complex belgium beer that goes great with game such as wild boar of venison. Also nice with a slice of artisan bread such as volkornbrot or pumpernickel.

Strong notes of candied sugar, ripe pears, orange peals, raisens, and dates even. Yes, finally an aggressive brew and not just from an alcohol perspective. More ripe fruit in the taste. You really can perceive the candied sugar. Nice, full mouthfeel. Slightly bicuity. Chewy but not overly so. This brew just embraces your palette. It's sweet and then migrates its way down and the alcohol presents itself; it's light but oh so nice. I'm a virgin to this brew no more and will make an effort to seek it out again.

The smell was classic Belgian: a bit of raisins, candied fruit, and alcohol; generous amounts of each. Almost reminded me of a tripel, only I don't care for most tripels, and I am really enjoying this. Taste was quite malty, plenty of candied fruit in the middle, and then a punch in the face with alcohol burn. It wasn't unpleasant, just strong. It is what you might expect a 9.5% Belgian to be. The mouthfeel was magnificent. Silky smooth with zero carbonation sting. Very pleasant to drink. So far, I have savoured each sip, rolling it around in my mought before I swallow it.

The flavor starts off with some big dark fruit flavors (plum, fig, grape and cherry), followed by candied sugar, funky barnyard belgian yeast, toasted bread, alcohol and some light mineraly hops. This is quite a nice belgian strong ale, reminds me of the abbaye de rocs beers without the overwhelming funky yeast. The mouthfeel is full and rich, but drinkability is only slightly above average.

More prevailant with plumbs, dates, figs, cashews, and a touch of chocolate. Not quite prunes or raisons, which is a good thing. Slight toasted character. Body is a touch fuller than most Trippels.

4.04,-0.5,3,4,4.5,4,3.5,"To begin with, this beer was not much to look at. It was a clear reddish brown, with no head. When poured, or swirled, there was only a sudden bubbling, but then ever so quickly the tiny bubbles got shy and faded away. The aroma of this beer was great though. It was almost like a vanilla pound cake, a very desserty-type smell. Sweet and warm. A bit spicy but really a brown sugar or vanilla smell to it. Taste was even more of the same, and then some. Molasses, vanilla, alcohol, a tiny bit of spicy cinnamon or clove?, caramel, no, toffee, and a tinge of a roasty aftertaste - actually what it really reminded me of when I swallowed was raisin bran, strange as that may sound, before morphing into a very dry grapey aftertaste. That's the redeeming quality of this beer- if not for the dry aftertaste, it'd be like drinking syrup. Too sweet. Hot too. When I was nearing the end of my glass, I was reminded of Oerbier, which I hadn't had in a while. But yes, it is a bit similar to that, in it's toffee-roasty-dry-sweetness. A world of contradictions, yes, but the only way to describe this one. Mouthfeel was average- fizzy despite its appearance, and it had a bit of a numbing effect on my tongue and slipping down my throat it warmed me up all over. Drinkability was so-so, mostly because of the sweetness. Although the dry finish does wonders to cut the overwhelming sweet taste, it still is in the front, so would get sickening after more than maybe 2 of these. Plus the high alcohol would, like I said earlier, send me stumbling home if I treated it like a session beer. It's a good beer overall, and I will have it again. Just not a whole night of it.","erica","Jun 28, 2005"

Dark tangerine perhaps, but suffice it to say there are a great deal of different shades in the beer. The head was not overflowingingly massive, but just right. Dark cream/coffee colour, intensely creamy with slow moving screen lacing. In the aroma I first detect must, dark mouldy yeast qualities, which is not unpleasant. Next I smelt the dark malty sweetness, a warm alcohol note, and spicy fruit, nuts. There are strong grape juice aromas, and I definitely smell sharp aged cheese, which is singular. Sweet candy, with some sour/acidic smells too. The sweetness is not cloying, but complements the dry musky yeast expertly. The taste is quite unique, with dark malt sweetness and fruity yeast. Sugary sweet liquidy fruits, dry yeast finish, smooth syrupy on the middle. Prunes, overripe peaches or tangerines, and some caramel, bready cereals, toasted flavours, and saltiness. The lees tasted separately give all the same flavours except the potency is doublefold, and it looks as thick as melted caramel. Mouthfeel is full, lingering, syrupy, dry, with medium carbonation. High alcohol, extremely sweet mouthfeel followed by high dryness does not render this extremely drinkable. Perfect for an occasional indulgence, though.","Cwrw","Jul 28, 2004"
4.5,10.8,4,4,4.5,5,5,"Poured a deep rusty brown with a white head. The head receded to lace fairly quickly, but there is more than enough carbonation in the brew to keep that up to the bottom of the glass, I think. The aroma is sweet, with hints of currants, plums, and an alcoholic caramel malt. The flavor is sweet and rich, with a neat spiciness about halfway through and lingering in the finish. Alcohol notes cut through intermittantly, but it's a swirling mass of caramels and fruit. This beer is very carbonated, and blinds the tongue with each sip, letting the thick malt character in through the back door unnoticed until he cracks you over the head with a pipe wrench. Very good beer, definitely on the ""will purchase again soon"" list.","jlervine","Jul 15, 2004"

The head is thick and full of little bubbles, leaving little spots all around the glass. It smell of dark, ripe fruit with the musty smell characteristic of many Belgians. The taste is raisin and ripe grapes at the start but continues to develop as it sits a while. It's a bit like drinking a goblet full of thick sugar water but somehow it manages to avoid being cloyingly sweet. Just a bit of hop bitterness keeps things nicely in check. In short, the taste is pretty remarkable. The alcohol, while warming, is almost absent in the smell and taste, making it dangerously drinkable. Very nice stuff.","mickeymac","Jul 08, 2004"

This beer may have some interesting things going on in it, but the alcohol was so overpowering (both on the palate and in the effects it had on me) that I could not enjoy it. I've had stronger ABV beers where you barely notice the alcohol; in this brew it was all I could notice. I split the 750 into two sessions and tasted on two different days to make sure it wasn't bad biorythems or something. Maybe it was a bad bottle. Having said all that, it was a medium brown (translucent- almost thin looking) with a small head that quickly vanished. Aroma had alcohol, malt, sweetness, vanilla (?) and slight yeast. Flavor was alcohol, alcohol, and alcohol. Hidden behind was some malt, soft bread, nutty tones and perhaps a bit of bite from hops. Drinkability- I could barely finish either glass in two sessions because of the alcohol.","Dukeofearl","Jun 14, 2004"

This is simply one of the most well-rounded Belgian ales I've had. The sweet and yeasty character hits you full force, but a dark, fruity underlay is there to catch your fall. An argument for Belgian nationalism.","86MonteSS","Apr 24, 2004"

Aromas of raisins, apples, plum, candied fruit, bit of tropical fruit, and malt. Predominantly sweet and quite carbonated. Finishes with a yeasty astringent bite and a tannic edge that helps to balance the sweetness. The alcohol is just evident in the finish as well. This is quite a fruity beer, the sweetness definitely picks up this perception. There is a bit of a acidic sourness in the finish that really sets off this beer, I wish that it were even more sour (but I am off like that). This is pretty straight forward, with nice fruity notes being dominant. As it warms up the fruitiness combined with the sourness gives me notes of cherries. This is quite a tasty beer, at first I thought it was not as good as the others from Caracole, but this one is growing on me and I definitely like it.","Gueuzedude","Apr 20, 2004"

Smooth on the tongue, quite malty and rich with a bit of diacetyl - which I don't mind. Sweetness lingers on the tongue for a while to give a smooth aftertaste; this is very dangerously drinkable and doesn't easily give away that it is as strong as 9.5% ABV (unless you read the label, that is!).

Not sweet, and perhaps just a bit more fruit sweetness would have added some dimension. Not a great deal of bittering, nor significant yeasty phenols. As the beer warmed, a little caramel malt was present, but, again, not enough to make much of a statement. Really quite average in every department. I suppose the bottle art lead me to expect some creativity, and I was let down.","Brent","Jan 23, 2004"

Nose is rather complex with aromas of rum-soaked raisins, fig preserves, and some faint musty undertones. Fairly full-bodied and a bit syrupy in texture. Taste begins on the sweet side with notes of brown sugar and sweetened raisins leading to a bready and yeasty flavor. A mild spiciness follows along with notes of caramel and a bit of brandy that rounds out the finish. Thoroughly enjoyable brew here with a sweetness that becomes more pronounced as the beer warms. Some interesting pairings with many desserts could be done with this beer.","Morris729","Dec 27, 2003"

Things looked good right from the pour. The beer is a deep, deep ruby in color, with a moderate-to-thin sized creamy and persistant light tan head. The aroma was an enticing blend of slightly sweet toasted malt, peppery alcohol spiciness, and lingering must. The flavor contines in much the same vein, though it adds a surprising character of dry fruit -- berries, grapes -- to the mix, substituting for the bready flavors often found in these beers. Toasty malt remains the dominant flavor, however, and lingers pleasantly in a long-lasting aftertaste. Saaz-like hop finish is mild but lends some balance. Full bodied with a overall dry finish, this isn't the most complex Belgian dark ale I've had, but it's pleasant and surprising nonetheless.","mzwolinski","May 11, 2003"

Although not abundantly complex Nostradamus sports a somewhat sweet and fruity flavor with an alcoholic spiciness. Mouthfeel is nice with a mouth-coating creaminess and slightly slick and oily character. This Belgian definately gets good marks in the ""bang for the buck"" catagory.

Sherryish alcohol upfront in aroma, followed by sweet, fruity esters akin to ripe strawberries. As it breathes, maltiness and darker fruit esters become more pronounced, consisting of bittersweet dark caramel and chocolate malt and sugary figs. The aroma becomes progressively more toffeeish over time. Heaty fusels and phenol surface as well. Boldly aromatic, but not as seductive as other Dark Strongs. It's quite enticing nonetheless aromawise. Flavorwise, fruity, raisiny sweetness is perceived at first, then pronounced clove ensues. Pseudosweet, lightly peppery ethanol combines with the clovey phenol to form a mellow black licorice note. Both dark caramel derived and residual sweetness are left relatively unhindered by the paltry hop bitterness. A touch light in body, w/ a dry, alcoholic mouthfeel. The apparent copious use of dark candi sugar lends a combination of constituitively expressed cidery sweetness and heavily caramelized, molasses notes. Malt character is somewhat overshadowed by dark fruitiness and alcohol, and other than dark caramel malt, mild chocolate malt exists as an undertone. Finishes cleanly sweet with a light sensation of alcohol spice on the lips. Nostradamus is a raw, flavorful and complex brew. With adequate cellaring to smooth out the slightly rough edges, this will be outstanding. Although tasty in its current state, both ethanol and higher alcohols deter both the malt and ester profile from reaching their full potentials. Bottled Jan 2002.","marc77","Dec 04, 2002"

4.1,1,4,4,4,4,4.5,"750 ml bottle, corked & caged. The cork is dated 1/2002 so it's just 10 months old. As is the case with most Caracole beers, I feel this needs to age a bit to dry it out a little and increase the carbonation level. This bottle is a bit young and I'm disappointed that I didn't age it. That said... ... A rough pour brings up a short and foamy light tan head that rests shortly over a slightly hazy and deep copper body. The head drops, but keeps a good collar and light surface covering throughout the glass. The nose expresses mild dark fruit and sweet toffee-ish malt with some clear alcohol. The body is light/medium with an exceptionally fine but limited carbonation that's very soft and smooth in the mouth. The flavor starts malty and stays malty, displaying a lightly woody character, some fruitiness (including ripe berries and a gentle cherry), a mild but quite sweet toffee-ish note, and a noteable alcohol. It's rich but not really complex. The bitterness is limited but balances well, and makes a minor appearance at the swallow. It finishes dry - probably more from a high alcohol content than bitterness - with a mild licorice-like note.
