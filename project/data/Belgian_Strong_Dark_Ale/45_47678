4.22,4.2,4,4.5,4,4,4.5,"750 ml bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 7/19/2012. Pours fairly crystal clear dark ruby red color with a 2 finger fairly dense khaki head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Nice soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a large amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of big caramel, raisin, prune, orange peel, red grape, pear, apple, dark candi sugar, honey, toast, brown bread, light chocolate, clove, pepper, herbal, light must, and yeast earthiness. Fantastic aromas with great complexity and balance of dark/bready malt, sugar/honey, and fruity/earthy yeast ester notes; with great strength. Taste of big caramel, raisin, prune, red grape, pear, apple, orange peel, dark candi sugar, honey, toast, brown bread, light chocolate, clove, pepper, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Lingering notes of raisin, prune, pear, apple, orange peel, caramel, dark candi sugar, honey, toast, brown bread, clove, pepper, herbal, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a while. Very nice complexity of dark/bready malt, sugar/honey, and fruity/earthy yeast ester flavors; with a great malt/yeast flavor balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a smooth, fairly bready, and lightly slick/prickly mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is an awesome Belgian strong dark ale! All around great complexity and balance of dark/bready malt, sugar/honey, and fruity/earthy yeast flavors; and very smooth and crisp to sip on for the ABV. A highly enjoyable offering.","superspak","Feb 22, 2014"

I was fortunate enough to share this bottle with some good friends, but would have had no problem consuming the entire thing by myself. this is really outstanding, every bit as entertaining as the local 1.","StonedTrippin","Apr 12, 2013"

4.44,9.6,5,3.5,5,4,4.5,"Overall - The wildflower honey and subtle light fruits such as honey dew, lemon, orange peel and cherry really make this beer unique. Based off of Belgian classics, it manages to borrow from Trappist recipes, yet somehow induces its own beast. By taking said innovative ingredients and adding subtle elements, Brooklyn Brewing may have even accidentally created a monumental Belgian quad. Even though it is NOT a quad, again, it really shares many similarities to one. One of my new faves!","Agent1","0"
3.87,-4.4,3.5,4,4,4,3.5,"Pours a thin brown caramel color with a super big slightly off-white 4 finger head that takes up about 40% of the pour. It dissipates rather quickly leaving plenty of lacing. Smells of Belgium yeasts and sweet malts dominate the nose. First sip is all Belgium from the yeast to the malts. Plenty of figs and dried plum notes here too. Not much hops either as the yeast yields plenty of spice. Mouthfeel is amazing and really makes this beer worthwhile.","ATLbeerDog","Dec 12, 2011"

3.89,-4,4,5,3.5,2.5,4,"I've had this in the basement since 2009, someone talked me into opening this today, you know who you are ;) Pours a solid dark brown with a tightly bubbled off white head that dissipates rather quickly. The smell on this is just short of amazing. Citrus like orange and lemons on top of caramel and burnt sugars mixed with sweet fruity malts that remind me of sweet cherry, raisins, and apricots. Almost mead like honey aroma on this one. Taste is a bit on the sweet side but more caramel and burnt sugar than fruit on the palette. Still a bit of ethanol in the flavor even after 2 years; this seems to be a recurring issue for me and Brooklyn's bigger beers. Medium to thin body, high level of carbonation with a sweet syrupy although somewhat bubbly mouthfeel. Decent brew that smells fantastic, but fails to deliver on taste. For me this is a bit over carbonated, which ruins the mouthfeel, and still somewhat hot for a brew that is only 9% abv.","johnnnniee","Sep 28, 2011"

Not complex, but elegant. More cherries and malt in the mouth with the spice taking a subdued role in the taste compared to its upper hand in the nose. Dry end that finishes nicely.

The aroma was a little bit of a let down. Far from the best in the style. I pick up some floral elements along with some candied sugar. It just does not flood the olfactory senses with the elements that this style is know for. What this lacks in aroma is made up for with taste. Dark fruit and yesty esters makes this beer. Perhaps not as deep as other BSDAs but has sufficient flavor to make this enjoyable experience. This beer is perhaps the driest example of the style I have drank. I do not mind as I prefer beer on the dryer side of the sweet/dry spectrum. There is also some alcohol flavor and warmth in the finish. The body is a little thin but not too bad.

The nose had hints of clove, coriander, orange peel, caramel, and vanilla/chocolate, but tilted towards the sweeter end of the spectrum, with surprisingly strong hints of bubblegum and cotton candy too. The taste yielded all that the nose did and more, starting with a fruity/spiciness and then progressing to a brown sugar/cocoa powder/hazelnut sweet (not that dry) finish.

There is not much lacing on the glass. Smell was sugary and floral. Taste was very enjoyable. Lots of notes of caramel and honey, and also dried fruits like a nice Belgian quad. Slight cocoa aftertaste. Mouthfeel was a bit thin, and the carbonation too much on the palate. Would have preferred a bit more body and somewhat less effervescence.

This is not bad, I just think the recipe needs a bit of tweaking; actually the recipe is likely just fine, I think a slightly different fermentation profile would help quite a bit.

Those carry through on the palate with a chocolate/caramel quality becoming more pronounced. There's an initial fruity sweetness hinted at in the beginning that quickly turns into a wonderfully dry finish. As far as American-made Belgian styles, this has been one of my favorites thus far.

It would also benefit from more body. It's not a disaster by any stretch, but I'm now convinced that Brooklyn does not excel with Belgian beer styles. Local 2's worth a try.

A Belgian dark ale sounded perfect & while it lacked some Belgian qualities, I still think it's a fine dark ale, robust & tasty. The pour is a dark ruby-red to dark brown with a nice sticky, dense tan head about 1 finger. The aroma is a fruity flower with cinnamon which led me to expect a sweeter & tacky dessert beer. While the flavor is somewhat sweet, it is not too sticky and rather drinkable with nice tart grape, clove & of course rich chocolate qualities.

The yeast character adds a few spicy phenols, and a touch of bitterness is apparent at the end.

The taste is well balanced, but I am having trouble finding the honey advertised on the back of the label. There is a sort of mapel taste upfront, maybe that's what they were talking about. The spices from the belgian yeast is there, just not very strong. The mouthfeel is way way way too carbonated. So much so that it almost takes away from the flavor.

The flavor is interesting...the effect is bitter an dry, at first it seems that the malt is not balancing the bitterness, but as you drink there is lip-smacking sweetness and gradually the effect is a lot more drinkability than if massive sweetness was there at the outset to balance all the alcohol and bitterness.

In my opinion carbonation coupled with the spiciness is a good thing, but on the other hand, it gets in the way of everything else thats going on in this beer. Carbonation paired with the spicy character leads me more to say that this beer is much more ""tripelish"" than BSDA, as far as what I've enountered so far in BSDAs. Sure this is a Belgian Strong Dark, but it has more of a tripel quality to it. When I think BSDA this isn't what I think of, not even close, yet technically it is one...its dark, belgian, and strong. This is one that I'll probably buy again and compare it side by side with a really nice tripel and see how similar they are. Notes on that tasting to follow.","becktone","May 16, 2009"

It sort of dissipates quickly, leaving little bits of lacing. Looks about normal. The smell is filled with toffee, raisins, honey, sweet alcohol. Very nice, though it starts out with quite a strong whiff of carbonation and gas. The taste follows through on the smell. Rum, raisins, dates, overripe fruits, a tad of spice and earthiness. I can almost sense the citrus peel, but its hard to pick out among the other flavors. A bit of a tobacco flavor, which I've found many times in BSDAs. The complexity carries this one to the finish, makes it nice and enjoyable. The mouth is nearly overcarbonated, which is kind of common, which lends it to feeling thin. I'd say this one fits with the middle of the pack in that respect. The drink is really nice. Smooth and easy, tasty, the carbonation slows you down, but this is a beer of interest.

Overall this didn't have a very bold or complex flavor, but it was very clean and enjoyable. It had a nice smooth body too, and hid the alcohol quite well.

The lack of hops in taste is more than made up by the brown sugar sweetness and harmony of the flavors in this beer. Calling it beer is a bit of a strech since this has a taste and feel all it's own.

Taste is quite good. Malt character is a bit more subdued and both hop flavor and bitterness a low. Fruity esters are the centerpiece here with green apple giving way to some plums. Clove-like phenols are present in the background. The late palate and finish are dominated by a very rose-like alcohol.

The pleasing appearance got me further excited to taste this latest offering from Garrett Oliver. The smell was a mix of floral and orange peel aromas and was wonderful as well. The taste perfectly captured the essence of orange peel and honey used in this construction, and the zesty sweet taste was rapidly followed by a dusty dryness as a result of the judicious use of all consuming Belgian yeast. There was some cherry and apples in the flavor as well, but the taste was fleeting and basically begged to be sipped again. No sign at all of the alcohol. The high carbonation kept the body airy and soft. Just like the darker versions of superheroes, this beer is what Duvel would be in opposite world.","rajendra82","Apr 16, 2009"

Slowly pouring this deep dark brown liquid into my tulip it created a ton of head, some staying for a few minutes but not the lacing. Once in the glass there were Belgian style smells, yeast and sweet hop aromas. A kick of spicy citrus slams into my taste buds at first sip, accompanied by notes of caramel, raisin, and honey followed by an after taste of alcohol.

It doesn't have that earthy feel that some Belgians' posess. The taste is great as well. It's incredibly smooth with huge bursts of fruit. The malt bill provides a ton of sweetness along with the candy sugar. The honey adds alcohol and a thin finish. The yeast esters really make this beer. The mouthfeel is good.

Brew poured to a deep and cloudy brown color with a thick medium tan colored head that had incredible retention leaving thick frothy chunks of foam down the side of the glass. The aroma was very sweet, candy sugar is very noticeable in this one, at least that is what I am figuring it is. Also some orange notes come to mind. The flavor is very good, again sweet with a nice belgiumesq yeast taste that I notice straight away. Also there is a nice fruit like flavor, maybe green apple. Numerous complex flavors seem to be there on this one that I am having a hard time putting to words. Alcohol is noticeable in this one but is nice. Finishes on the dry side. Overall I like this brew, think it is a little rough around the edges and wonder if it sits for a while it might lose some of that roughness.

The mouth feel is tangy and substantially effervescent with a ton of tiny bubbles lending to a creamy feel that finishes clean and dry.

The taste has some similar qualities as well as quite a bit of citrus laced throughout and less of the bready and apple notes. Still, very nice overall.

Kind of like an apertif. Mouthfeel, like the Local 1, is great. If the alcohol were not so pwersistant, I'd score this much higher for drinkability.

Anyway, poured in to my Ommegang Chocolate Indulgence goblet a nice burgundy color, with a small amount of white heading. First things that came to my mind in the smell were cola or perhaps rootbeer. Sweet honey and a little bit of spice are in there too. Taste has a mix of dark fruit, chocolate, some chalky esters, overall very complex. Body is medium to heavy, never boozy, and a lot more carbonated than I was expecting. Drinkability is good, I would have no problem clearing this bottle. Some have commented that this beer is a little green at this point, which I agree with to some point, but I still think it drinks fine now.

Medium-bodied, would be heavy if not sloth-like were it not for the foamy carbonation to mask a good deal of the sweetness. Date, prune, raisin, plum, cherry fruit leads with moments of apricot, banana. The floral side lacks clarity, muted by honey, molasses, brown sugar flavors.

4.45,9.9,4,4,4.5,4.5,5,"The first thing that stands out in my mind is how smooth the honey added to the beer makes it. Upon first taste, it is like a standard belgian dark. Little bit of yeasty pop, belgian sugars balanced out by an off-dry earthiness, and an undercurrent of dark fruits with a splash of brown sugar. But at the phase where you might normally expect hop balance, you get a blast of cool, smooth honey, belgian sweetness and a little kick that sends your tongue for a loop. It's this honey-smooth yet slightly sweet and earthy flavor that lingers, that makes this beer so gorram addictive. Mouthfeel is nice if not amazing, the honey is a little medicinally cloying, but thanks to the nice carbonation it is helped along. Very creamy, though, almost silky in complexion. This beer has amazing drinkability. Not just a sipper, I can't put it down. So smooth, no alcoholic presence, kick, bite, aftertaste, none of it. Simply sublime.

There were definitely some very good aspects to the flavor, but between the high carbonation and the medicinal quality I had a hard time focusing on them. The sweetness was a little cloying, and the bitterness although unexpected did not offset it quite enough for my tastes. As the glass progresses it gets a bit better as the carbonation drops off some. I really enjoyed the wildness in the aroma and flavor too.

Rich with dark fruits (date and plum), ripe fruits/fruit peel (some peach and apple come to mind), with hints of candi sugar and even banana. The yeast flavours dominate much of this brew, but some soft hops for flavour are apparent along with the modest maltiness. Body offers that 'traditional foamy feeling' in the mouth... that assertive carbonation that breaks down with each sip and dries away as quickly as it came.

Medium-bodied and slightly sticky at times, this beer is mostly a smooth sailer with light yeast notes making that typical Belgian taste. Has sweetness to it, mostly caramel and butterscotch (think mild sweetness and sticky) with some roasted notes. Also has an orange fruitlike taste and finishes dry thanks to some hop bitterness and the ABV warms the tongue a little. A good offering from the BB and a nice sipper to relax with.","clayrock81","Mar 04, 2009"
4.18,3.2,4.5,4,4.5,3.5,4,"I'm going back and forth on this one trying to decide just how much I like it. Do I like it a lot, or do I like it a lot lot. Either way I like it a lot, but it's the difference between very good and great that I'm grappling with. I think it's very good, and quite complex, but it doesn't quite seem great to me. Still, I would be very happy to enjoy this with regularity. Very well done, Brooklyn.","number1bum","Mar 04, 2009"
4.26,5.2,4.5,3.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"I am drinking this as I am doing the review, and the flavor, most noticeably at the end and the aftertaste is constantly changing as it warms. A very interesting beer.","dohastmich","Mar 03, 2009"
3.86,-4.7,4.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Pours a very deep chestnut amber brown color with a massive tan/beige head that stuck around for most of the glass, thick, swiss cheese-like holes cratered the surface like a giant soaked sponge. Good nose here, floral with definite notes of lime blossom, aged orange skin, chocolate malt, caramel and a distinctive but subtle Belgian-esque yeast strain. Flavor is much the same, chewy, sweet malts, lacking any hop character or true bitterness for that matter. Caramel, brown sugar, butterscotch, chocolate powder on the finish, a little bit of alcohol heat dries out the experience but is no where near offensive. Upon constant smelling of this beer, it smells a little too perfumey for me, almost overpowering to its flavor. Medium bodied with a lively mouthfeel. Layered but remaining simple enough for a true breakout beer for the public market to enjoy at an excellent price point. Quality materials no doubt, well made just the same","ATPete","Mar 03, 2009"

4.38,8.1,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"This is one scarily drinkable beer. Nary a hint of alcohol, and the lightness is remarkable, but you'll definitely feel this one. Floats like a butterfly, stings like a Mack truck. Fantastic effort.","JohnQVegas","Mar 02, 2009"

3.95,-2.5,3.5,3.5,4,3,5,"The aroma is very much like a belgian ale with it's fruitiness. There is only a little bit of honey and citrus. The appearance is red brown with a super large head. The flavor is like the aroma. The palate is a tad thin but smooth. Overall it's very good.","nick76","Feb 28, 2009"

4.35,7.4,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Very mellow and good for the style. The orange peel adds a bit more depth to it. It's well-crafted and shows that Brooklyn knows their stuff with Belgian-style ales. I would recommend that you pick up a bottle.","Brad007","Feb 22, 2009"
4.42,9.1,4.5,5,4,4.5,4.5,"Rich in Belgian sugar and dark fruits like plums and raisins. Their is the typical strong Belgian yeast flavor which is almost nutty. The malt is not overly sweet which is nice. The first thing that you notice when you drink this one is that it has a good amount of carbonation and the second thing is that a good amount of aging will only improve on its all ready stellar characteristics.","Hokies","Feb 20, 2009"

4.2,3.7,4,4,4,4,5,"Out of a 750ml corked and caged bottle. Pours a dark brown color with some golden highlights, a fizzy soda like head that dissipates fairly quickly. The aroma is sweet from the candi sugar, with some honey notes, a bit flowery, and some yeasty phenols. The flavor is of raisins, plums, honey, and dark candi sugar. Some nice yeasty flavors and a balancing hop presence. The flavors are nice and smooth and work well together. Nothing is too powerful or overly sweet. The feel is fairly light with loads of carbonation, perhaps too carbonated. A sweet brew overall but that is offset with the hops. A damn drinkable BSDA. No outrageous BSDA flavors but what it has is good and in nice balance","Gmann","Feb 16, 2009"
4.5,11.1,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Poured this into my Chimay chalice just below room temp. The cork came out real easy. Pours a creamy dark brown color with big thick head, despite a real gentle pour. I had to let it sit for a few minutes before the head faded, and it left all sorts of sticky lacing. Smells malty sweet and I get a hint of smokiness. There is some spice in the smell as well, with a bit of alcohol mixed in. A balanced aroma...no single scent jumps out. The taste follows the nose. Sweet, malty, spicy. A touch of honey in there as well. A surprisingly dry mouthfeel. Heavy, but dry. Leaves a bit of stick behind. Minimal carbonation. A very nice, drinkable beer.","mtbbaboon","Beers"
4.5,11.1,4,4,5,4,4.5,"D- At 9% not an everyday beer but this size botle was fine over an hour and change. A great example of the BSDA style and I look forward to local 3, if that ever happens. cant wait to see what some time will do.","BARFLYB","0"
4.73,16.8,4.5,4,5,5,5,"For me this is what Duvel is to Belgian strong pale ale. What Chimay Reserve ( blue ) is for strong Dark ale. A paradigm. While it does not establish the style, ( as does Duvel ) it certainly lays down a marker of what the style is and should be.","scootny","Feb 09, 2009"
4.27,5.4,4,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,"D - Very drinkable. I kept wanting to pour another hit from the 750. Many Belgian-style darks force me to slow down, but this was damn the torpedoes, full speed ahead.","Patrick999","Feb 06, 2009"
3.67,-9.4,3.5,4,3.5,3,4,"Brooklyn completely re-ferments in the bottle (100%), so this one will grow with time.","jessecarr","Beers"
4.28,5.7,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,"Local 2's deep chestnut body is capped by a fluffy head of light tan that displays excellent retention and leaves almost solid walls of lace about the glass. The nose is floral and sweet with a hint of candy and some mild caramel. In the mouth it's delicately spritzy with a very fine-bubbled, natural carbonation from bottle conditioning. The flavor is as the nose suggests with sugary caramel and delicate fruit (apple, lime, grape) peppered by yeasty spiciness and moderate phenols. The bitterness is restrained allowing the maltiness to shine, but it also pushes back at mid-palate, and then ushers in a dry finish - no doubt bolstered by the alcohol, which only presents itself at the end. Perhaps I'm swayed by the label, but I also get a hint of honey on the tip of the tongue in the finish. Very nicely balanced, and remarkably drinkable.","NeroFiddled","0"
