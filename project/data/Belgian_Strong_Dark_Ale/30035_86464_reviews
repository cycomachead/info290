"While more sweet than my impression of this style would anticipate, Gregorius is enjoyable. Lacking layers and complexity expected of a Belgian Strong Dark Ale, this could be considered an entry level, after-work, relaxing beer."
"Pours cloudy dark brown beer with 0.5-finger off-white head. Smell of dark fruits, apple and honey. Taste of dark fruits, candy sugar, raisin, warming alcohol. Medium-bodied, good brew."

"This is medium bodied and moderately carbonated. Overall not a bad brew but I wasnt the biggest fan of the strong cider flavors which comprised most of this beers profile."
""
""
"Overall: A somewhat fascinating specimen, and yet, the flavor and aroma beg for a bit more complexity. The harsh mouthfeel is interesting, but perhaps not I the best of ways, as it begins to distract and detract from the flavor."
""
""
"Very murky, dark brown color.  Little foam head.  Scorched malt flavor on front and back.  Sweet, nutty flavor.  Crisp finish.  For how high the ABV is you don't detect heavy alcohol."
"Pours a murky, prune juice reddish-brown producing less than a single finger of tightly bubbled, tan, shortlived head that leaves minimal lace. Aroma is malty burnt brown sugar, molasses, dark fruits, anise, spice, earthy hops, some wood & musty hay/hints of dark honey, Belgian funk & light alcohol. Taste is dark malts, sugary dark bread, anise, fig, prune, raisins, soured fruit, brown sugar, smoke, earth, alcohol & faint honey with lots of lively pepper & spice especially from mid-sip through the lightly bitter & warm finish. Aftertaste is malty, earthy woody & sweet with an alcohol prominence that fades to a faint bitter astringency. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with lively carbonation, spicy/prickly & crisp & somewhat dry late in the sip."

"Overall: I like this beer quite a lot.  It hits my favorite areas for the style quite nicely."
""
"O:  It's a very complex beer.  Kind of driving my taste buds crazy right now, not in a bad way.  Alcohol is well hidden throughout the beer.  I like this beer more than most of the Americanized versions of a Belgian strong dark."
"Truly fascinating to the palate. Nice sour and bitter finish balanced perfectly. The honey sets it off with great complex flavors as well."
"very complex but too sweet for my taste.  let it warm and it gets better."
""
" The taste is somewhat date-like with sweet dark cherry-like flavor and earthy vinous  and slightly toasted malt flavor with slight alcohol emerging as it warms with a tobacco-like earthy element with a burnt sugar flavor and dark caramel quality almost prune-like with a full sweet and dried fruit flavor. Overall this is a pretty excellent dark belgian ale with some nice yeast complexity and very drinkable in general for the 10% abv"

"This is an excellent quad, on par with the best American versions I've had.  That lasting overripe sourness, however, keeps it firmly from the territory of Rochefort et al.  A wonderfully crafted and delicious beer."
""
"Aside from a rather rough mouthfeel, this is a fine tasting, great smelling strong ale. Huge dark ale flavors of ripe, dark fruits with a nice, stinging twinge of alcohol and coarse bitterness."
""

"O:  So thrilled to have found this at Bruisin Ales in Asheville.  A year and a half earlier, a misinformed tour guide at a brewery told me that beer from this brewery was only likely to available in the next 5 years by going to Europe.  Never saw it in Belgium.  Thrilled to have seen it at least in two places in the US recently.  Drinking this one in my Orval chalice in Kunming, China as my 1000th beer reviewed on Beeradvocate."
"O: Disappointing; particularly the gunk in the bottle. Unpleasant looks, while the aroma and flavour are rich and sweet with harsh undertones. Body is OK. It resembles a quad but hasn't aged as well as I might have wished. Fruity but plagued by off-notes and generally unsatisfying. Perhaps this is just a bad bottle - the potential is certainly there. I may re-review if I get the chance. That said - caveat emptor."
""
""
""
"Overall, this beer is just not that refined and complex. It is actually somewhat disappointing for a Trappist beer. Nothing to go out of your way for."
""
""
"I poured the beer into a chalice. Unfortunately I lost a little beer because the beer foamed as soon as I opened the bottle. I suspect there's a little too much yeast in the bottle. The beer was a good dark color. The head never completely dissappated. I smelled fruit, like figs and raisins. The taste was rich with malt and fruit. The beer had a creamy consistency."

"Overall: Very enjoyable beer to start my birthday. Might have to go fact and get another bottle."
""
"Dark brown to nearly black in color. An inch of light beige head rests on top. I smell dark malt and honey. I taste earthy dark malt and honey but it just seems a bit too simplistic. The mouth is fairly carbonated and tastes of alcohol. There's a moderate dark malt aftertaste."
""
""
""
""
"Nice addition to the trappist lineup. I'd like to think with the malt they're separating themselves from the default more northern standard for the style."
""
""
""
"Drinkability: Very interesting, complex and pleasant. The high alcohol content starts to strike you after the first half."
""
""
""
""
"O: Just didn't quite cut it for me. Pretty good, but a little too timid on the aroma and taste- possibly suffering from the high alcohol?"
""
""
""
""
""
"A tasty Belgian beer, but might be the weakest of the Trappist bunch. Quite some off notes, hopefully there wasn't something wrong with my bottle. I'll try more, but i don't really think the review will be different."
"Overall: This is a great beer with good promise. I think stylistically this is more in-tune with a dubbel or doppelbock rather than how it's currently labeled. Comparing this with Trois Pistoles or Maudite is like comparing two entirely different beers because, well, they are. Elimination of the yeast clumps would make this beer significantly better in appearance and mouthfeel, but the taste is quite good and largely redeems this brew."

"Overall I was a little underwhelmed after being excited after seeing this new beer with the patented Trappist stamp on it. Not bad, but also not great. Really tastes like a middle of the road dopplebock to my taste."

"Gregorius may lack that certain 'je ne sais quoi' of time-honoured Belgian monastic Quads, but Austria's first (and thus far only) Trappist brewery seems to be off to the right start. This is a very serviceable and satiating strong, rich, dark ale. The use of honey is purely incidental amidst such spicy yeast, formidable alcohol, and heavy maltiness, but still this recipe needs no changing."

"If I didn't know this was a Trappist brewery out of Austria I'd think it was an American brewery trying their hand at the style, what with the seemingly aggressive hopping to keep things balanced. It's a good beer but not nearly as refined as the established Trappist offerings."
""
""
""
""
"There are some better Strong Dark Ales, but this one is quite enjoyable. A great slow sipper on a cold day."
""
"Not too similar to most belgian trappists, much more farmhouse ale type flavors than the rich tripple malt that I was expecting, but nothing wrong with that. This is good, and definitely one to have."
"Atmosphere is pretty good. Slight bubbly head and some fair lacing. Sweet fruity components mostly overshadow the light roasty, chocolate, and earthy flora components. As in the nose, sweet fruity components are the most prominent characteristics, pungency and light bitterness are also present. A little hot and boozy. Overall, this is a pretty good quaff."
""
""
"The bottled product was also very good. It continues the high expectations and traditions of an excellent Trappists beer."
""
"O- This beer is a classic in the abbey style. Great subtle depth that grows as the beer opens, making it simple yet elegant. It really helped to take the chill of coming in from the cold."
"Overall, this is solid stuff, albeit not up with the best examples. It's fairly well constructed, and has some interest and complexity to it. Something I'll certainly revisit at some point."
""
""
""
""
"Hmm- a Trappist beer from Austria- I must not have been paying attention. Definitely tastes like a quad- vinous and strong with some herbal and stewed fruit notes and the distinctive twang of Belgian yeast. The aroma, particularly, is well done. The taste adds some notes of chocolate and some red fruit in the finish. The abv is well hidden, and the finish is exuberantly fruity- perhaps even a bit sour from the fruit. It lacks the depth of the very best quads, but is still a nice surprise."
""
""
""
"500 ml bottle. Pours hazy brown with long lasting, creamy, tanned head. Aroma is of funky yeast, dark fruit, brown sugar, and hints of chocolate and herbal hops. Body is full and crisp. Taste is of chocolate, dark fruit, brown sugar, herbal hops, toasted malt, and hints of wood and alcohol. Finish is long and dry. Wonderful, delicious brew."
""
"Poured a nice reddish brown with a one finger tan head, leaving little lacing down the glass. Quite nice and true to style, a good appearance. Scents of Belgian yeast, some wild, sour aromas, faint candi sugar, overripe fruit, grape, plum, slight cocoa, dark chocolate and some brown sugar. A very nice, complex aroma, true to form for an Abbey strong dark, very well executed. Taste begins with dark fruit, prune and raisin with some sour funk in the background. White grape appears in the middle, along with spicy yeast and sweet spices. Towards the end of the sip better sweet chocolate and bready malt come forward. A good amount of alcohol is present in the flavor. A sweet brew, with the usual Belgian spiciness. Very well done, quite complex and enjoyable. Mouthfeel is medium-heavy bodied with medium low carbonation and a semi-drying, chalky mouthfeel. Very good, very much a Belgian. Overall this is a good Belgian Strong Dark. All the usual flavors and aromas are on display, the complexity is present and its a very good beer. Its not quite on the level of Rochefort, Chimay or Bernardus, but its very good regardless."
""
"330 ml bottle into chalice, bottled in 1/2013. Pours murky dark reddish brown color with a 1-2 finger dense khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big raisin, plum, prune, fig, pear, apple, caramel, toast, molasses, dark bread, honey, herbal, light clove, light bubblegum, and yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good complexity and balance of dark malt and fruity yeast ester notes; with good strength. Taste of big raisin, prune, fig, pear, apple, molasses, caramel, toast, toffee, dark bread, honey, herbal, light clove, light bubblegum, and yeast earthiness. Lingering notes of dark/light fruits, molasses, caramel, toast, toffee, dark bread, clove, honey, herbal, light bubblegum and yeast earthiness on the finish for a while. Big robustness and very nice complexity of dark malt and fruity yeast ester flavors; with a good malt/fruitiness balance and no cloying sweetness after the finish. Medium carbonation and very full bodied; with a very slick, creamy, and lightly syrupy mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is well hidden with only a small warming present after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice Quadrupel style. All around good complexity, balance, and robustness of dark malt and fruity/spicy yeast flavors; and quite smooth to sip on for the ABV. A very enjoyable offering."

"3.5's across the board."

"O: Certainly not as complex as its Trappist brethren. Not bad stuff, but the expectations will be very high. It just feels a little too plain-Jane, especially when compared to a Chimay or a Rochefort, which is exactly what consumers will do."
"O: Good drinkability. The Trappist stamp creates some expectations that this beer cannot accomplish. An authentic Belgian Strong Dark Ale, however, a less remarkable Trappist Ale"
""
""
"Overall, decent, but the booze is way too prominent and it is too sweet."
""
""
""
"Overall: I will be picking this up again. If the Benno is as good as the Gregorious, Engelszell shall be named among my top favorite Trappist breweries."
"Nose of raisins and honey. Relatively spritzy mouthfeel. Deep raisin and plum. Dark caramel and honey. Very full flavor as Trappists should be. Very warming. Perfect for an autumn day. Belgian yeast is up from with the esters. Doesn't linger on the tongue too long. There is a roasty or hoppy dryness at the end that does not dry up completely. Very warming alcohol. The honey is on the lips when you lick them. This is very excellent and pulls its own weight in the Trappist world. I'm quite glad the honey is noticeable, sometimes it ferments out completely."

"What brewer gets the Authentic Trappist label next some western Russian monks, sigh."

"A very good flavorful ale, great body, and interesting aromas and balance. There are still better dark Belgians than this but it's still a great representation of the style and worth trying."

"Thanks to Woody for the brew. This looks like the stuff. An almost black brown with a very minimal creamy tan head. Smells of raspberries, cherries, and pipe tobacco (I only know because of my Pop and do not condone said products. Blech.) The taste has a lot going on, grapes, cloves, that tobacco thing, and something that tastes like plants smell. I know that's vague, but this review is free, so you get what you pay for. Mouthfeel is slippery and carbonated in a very controlled way. Overall, I don't like this beer quite as much as I want to. It has potential, but the taste just doesn't quite pull things together the way I'd hoped. Still. You won't go wrong. Especially if Woody is keeping you supplied."
""
"T: Lots of dark fruit and yeast upfront. Slight hint of spice, plum, chalky yeast and a hint of banana bread and chocolate."
"11.2 ounce bottle, label says Brewed in Year 2013/01. Served in a DFH Signature Glass, the beer pours a murky mahogany brown color with about an inch tan head. Head retention and lacing are both good. The brew smells like dark fruit, dark bread, sweet spices, clove and honey. I think for the most part the taste is the same as the aroma, but there's also some herbs, molasses and some nuts noticeable. This is definitely a sweeter tasting brew. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's slick, smooth and easy to drink. I thought this was a good beer, I wouldn't mind trying this one again in the future. $5.99 a bottle."
""
""
""
"D: This was a nicer beer than Benno, but still not an impressive quad. The scent was great, but the taste was more like a brown ale. The body was ok, and the finish was reasonably smooth, so it wasn't difficult to drink. Would probably benefit from some time in the cellar. Decent fresh, but nothing special."
""
"Later notes: This does mellow and the sweetness does become bearable. Notes of oak show themselves. I have changed my scores accordingly."
""
"Overall, not bad. I'm not super impressed, either, though my first impression of cleaning up half the beer from my counter and seeing only the other half in my glass likely did not help. I may have gotten a weird bottle, though."
""
"Interesting but less compelling than hoped."
""
""
""
"Overall: Okay Belgian Strong Ale. Simply too sweet and ripe. I prefer their Benno beer by a wide margin, which is some kind of Saison/BPA/Braggot concoction."
""
""
""
""
"O: Great overall Trappist product. not in the same league as the Belgian counterparts but delicious nonetheless."
""
"OVERALL: This is a humdinger of a beer brewed by Austrian Trappist monks. The use of honey was an interesting twist, but very traditional at the same time. I want to wear a hooded robe and drink this all day transcribing manuscript, these monks are the real deal."
"A new Trappist beer that will hopefully be around for centuries. It meets my stamp of approval, no problems here. A wonderfully rich and textured beer with lots to appreciate in flavor and aroma. Great mouthfeel gives it class. Support the monastaries. Enjoy a Gregorius."
""
"Very, very dark head with an acceptable head. Smells malty and sweet. Strong flavor, slightly bitter on the back of the throat, slightly sweet on the tongue. Decent in the mouth."
""
""
""
"So much power and it is truly a meal in a glass. Nicely made."
"This is definitely a dark ale. Carries robust character. Feel is good. I do have to note that it seems almost Flemish in execution. It has that cherry wood character thing going on. I don't think this would be intentional, but I like it. As a Trappist production, I would expect it not to be."
""
""
""
""
""
"Gregorius pours a muddy brown with a dense head. The aroma is sweet with dark fruits, and slightly tart. The taste is fruity up front, with a bit of darkness from the malt brewing in the back the whole time. A bit of tartness and Belgian yeast round out the flavor. Overall, Gregorius is a tasty beer, if not jaw-dropping. A solid introduction from the new Trappist brewery."
"I think this would get more of a pass if it weren't a Trappist, but really has some rough spots to work out. I can definitely see potential there, & what's good is really good."
"O- I will try this on draft and see if it is different, but would think twice about spending the large amount of money I spent on this one again. It was priced quite high since it is still somewhat hard to find."
"Pours a black color. 1/4 inch head of an off-tan color. Slight retention and slight lacing. Smells of sweet malt, alcohol, slight roasted malt, hint of hops, and a hint of spices. Fits the style of a Belgian Strong Dark Ale. Mouth feel is smooth and clean, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of alcohol, sweet malt, hint of roasted malt, caramel malt, hint of pale malt, and a hint of syrup. Overall, the body is not reminiscent of a Belgian Strong Dark Ale, but more closely resembles a Doppelbock in flavor."
""
""
""
""
"Overall – A rather decent Belgian Quad that is on the sweeter side but still quite appropriate in taste in terms of its quad classification. Even though it is under most of the other Trappist beers, in my opinion, it is still rather tasty and well worth a try."
""
"Very flavorful, but not really balanced. The mouthfeel is closer to soda than most beers."
""
"I am not sure what happened to this beer, whether it was the dregs of the batch or not, but the bottle was around 50% sediment. I poured it into a tulip glass, and it clugged like a spoiled bottle of milk. One sip was all I could handle, and the smell was musty. I don't think I am going to try this again, given that it was not cheap, and there are better beers out there."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Overall, this is a very nice beer and worthy of the Trappist Product designation. It's not quite on the same level as best in class quads mentioned above, but it's well worth searching out and trying, especially if you are a Trappist Explorer!!"
"Poured from a 330ml bottle. Pours a beautiful deep mahogany red. This beer has quite a robust nose that's redolent of red wine, cooked fruits and booze. It smells amazingly rich and fruity. The taste is similar, with a lot of sweet fruit notes, caramel malt notes, plenty of booze and a tart, dry finish. Great post-meal sipper."
""
""
"Pours a five+ finger light tan head that fades slowly leaving a good lace. Opaque dark brown color. Good carbonation and medium bodied. Dark fruit and honey nose, flavor is more molasses than honey and earthy coffee. Pricey at $6.99 for a 330ml bottle from Julio's Liquors Westborough, MA. Brewed Nov 2012."
"And with the same type of satisfaction of Koningshoeven La Trappe Quad, Gregorius has fit the Trappist Strong Dark Ale taste, complexity, and drinakability to a tee."
""
""
"The honey is a little difficult to find in the flavor. Instead my taste buds are teased with dark malts, cherry, licorice, coffee, and a slightly lingering bitterness at the end. There are some characteristics that I like about this one."
"Pours very dark brown/purple with about a half finger of head. The lacing seems to cling fairly well, so I will give them that. The aroma comes off as very earthy almost chocolatey and the typical BSDA fruit flavors are muted. There is definitely a lot of fruit here compared to other beers, but for the style, I don't think I've smelled anything like it. The flavor it a bit more typical, but I think this beer is trying to do its own thing. I've got lots of cherry and bit of fig, but that dark earth also really comes through due to the dryness of this brew. It's quite a bit different than its Trappist brethren, but that is quite alright. It also is a little untamed, as in hot. After the monks perfect their brewing arts in the coming years [I assume they are getting help from the other Trappists], we will have a world-class beer here."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: not bad at all... a little rough around the edges... all in all, Trappist worthy?"
"This one doesn't have all the big but balanced richness of the greats, but it's certainly not bad. It has enough body, though I might prefer a touch more, and displays a little dryness coming into the finish."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O) A good example of the Trappist Belgian Brune"
""
"Pours a murky brown with a foamy dark khaki head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace slowly drip into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is of malt, honey, dark fruit, and some earthy hop aromas. Taste is much the same with toasted bread and fruity flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of spice bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp but medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer but it's much more earthy and slightly rough compared to how I thought it would be."
"jd"
""
""
"An interesting, and tasty enough take on the entrenched Trappist BSDA - the initial delta indicated on the label - the honey - really taking a back seat to the skulking sour fruit character that comes to fill one's perception of this offering. Which I suppose is just fine, as who really wants another Rochefort/Westy/La Trappe clone (as good as those are), when there's new ground to break? Beer-speaking, of course, as the Abbey itself was founded back in 1293."
"Has the appearance and body of a great dark trappist beer, but lacks the candy sugar / yeast balance I love in this style."
""
""
""
""
"Bottom Line: Like Trappist bier....here you go!"
"O: the nose was initially very interesting, and the continuing lingering taste is cool however I don't care for the actual taste that is lingering."
"Drinkability : a good beer in the style Belgian quadruple (trappisten bier)"
""
"330 ml. bottle. Dark brown colour, off white head, not big and not much retention. Smell of figs or raisins, fennel, clove and some cinnamon. Astringent palate, with some medicinal flavor. Light to medium body. Taste ia acid, fennel, cherries and chocolate. A bit messy, not really one of the best trappist I've tasted. I'll to keep one bottle aging and try again."
""
""
""
"Pours a deep, rich brown. Thick beige head. Sticks around well. Very good looking beer. Unfortunately, the rest of the beer didn't live up to that appearance for me. The aroma is a mix of medicinal yeast and toasty malt notes. Little bit of nail polish remover and wood. The malt has some nice things going on - toffee, dates, plums, caramel, bread and molasses - but it's still kinda simple. There's just too much sweetness mixing with those medicinal Belgian esters, and it doesn't really work. The taste is quite sweet. Somewhat cloying. Oddly vinous and still fairly toasty. It's kind of a mess. Fair bit of booze. Fairly heavy feel. Coats the mouth more than I'd like, but that might be more a flavor issue than feel. Carbonation is normal. This was a disappointment. I was pretty excited to find this beer and try a new Trappist brewery, but it's just not very good."

"Bottle purchased from Beer Planet in Brussels - Was really excited to give this one a try. Pour was just as I hoped it would be, nice and dark and full rocky head. Nose was crazy complex, strong aroma of smoke (if not charring), as well as dark bitter chocolate and black coffee. Good, full mouth feel but just as the nose suggested strong smokey rauch flavor. Almost burnt taste. Taste changed little as the beer slowly warmed. Not bad, but not great either. I would argue the Austrians still have a thing or twto to learn from the Belgians."

"Overall, very interesting and certainly unique for a Trappist beer. The honey and molasses notes were interesting, with slight spice through the background. I'm looking forward to seeing how this beer/recipe develops over time."
"Poured into a Gouyasse tulip glass. Pours a very dark mahogany brown with a fine two finger light tan head with great retention and lacing. Aroma of dark fruit, dark malt, winter spices (clove and cinnamon), slightly vinous. Dense flavor of concentrated dark and dried fruit, dark malt, chocolate, aged wine, hints of cinnamon and clove. Integrated and woody flavors similar to a barrel aged ale. Medium to heavy bodied with excellent creaminess. Complex, unusual and interesting, I enjoyed this new entry into the Trappist beer world very much."
"new trappist brew, cool! pours super dark brown, pushing black, no glow at all, with a few inches of bubbly khaki head with fine retention. the nose is quite understated, with some smoked malt and Belgian yeast being the only real obvious notes. the flavor is very opposite, extremely robust and aggressive. its malt heavy, but not sweet, its moderately smoky, but not heavy, its really roasty, but not bitter, just chock full of contradictions. complex and will all the fine mouthfeel characteristics we now expect in trappist brews. its brightly carbonated and its fuller body is made light in this way. texture is a little runny, but it doesn't hurt the outcome. kind of a hard beer to classify, but the alcohol is extraordinarily well hidden and the yeast used is new to me, and I like it a lot. overall a tasty brew, new to shelves, and im curious to see what else they make. would not have known this was made with honey if it didn't say so on the label."
"Poured into a snifter glass. Pours dark brown to black with a two-finger length of light tan head. The beer appears to be well carbonated and the head dissipates at a moderate pace. The aroma is fruit forward, smelling a little like cherries and bananas. There are dark roasted malts and caramel. The flavor is much like the nose, which is fruit and malt forward. I get those cherry and banana notes from the yeast as well as dark fruit notes and some mild caramel with the roasted malts. The body is medium to full with strong carbonation. The finish is a little dry and there isn't much of an aftertaste. It's fairly easy drinking despite the high alcohol content. This is an excellent beer, but just so. I would recommend trying this beer if you're a completist for the Trappist breweries or you just like this style."

"A lovely Trappist Ale. This is from an early batch and given that is very good. The ester profile is a little excited but I do like it."
""
"Good, but nothing paradigm shifting."
"O: Okay, it's super rare, so it is worth a buy for ""rarity sake"". But I wasn't very wowed."
"O: Considering its strength, the alcohol is remarkably well hidden from the taste, which makes this beer very easy to drink."
""
""
""
""
"Tastes a bit messy and disjointed. Perhaps some aging would help smooth things out. At this point, though, it's a mishmash of massive candi sugar and dark corn syrup sweetness coupled with a somewhat artificial tasting tangy fruitiness and a ton of alcohol. Just big and boozy vs warming. Milk chocolate, vinous, sugary, woody, cherry pie filling. A lot going on here. It's kind of a mess, truthfully, although I suspect it might be a pleasantly surprising cellar experiment. Pretty nice coating mouthfeel. I find myself unusually intrigued by a mediocre beer."
""
"tastes a lot like the smell. a bit medicinal and booze, very musty semi vinious but not like a good wine. drinkable and good but I'm not sure if it's up to trappist standards"
"O: A solidly made, drinkable beer. I'm surprised this one has as low a rating as it does. Still, a tasty beer."
""
""
""
"O – This beer is not great. It’s not so bad if you can get by the Robitussin, but it just takes so much effort to do so. The phenols are just too pervasive in the aroma and flavor. By looking at the current reviews, I only see a couple other people even mention phenols. Maybe others don’t see it or maybe it doesn’t bother them, but it’s too much for me. In my opinion, there are much better Belgian strong dark ales out there."
"Overall: Not at all what I was expecting, and not really sure how to categorize this one. Sometimes not fitting within a style or definition is good, but this beer is a bit of an enigma, and I have nothing to really compare it with, but also nothing to truly define it. In the end, I just didn't really love the taste. While Stift Engelszell's other current beer (Benno) is also beyond style boundaries, I quite enjoyed that one. I'm not sure I'd pick this one up again."
"Body wise it is fine and I thought the beer well worth finding and tasting. A long way from being the best or even one of the best ’Trappist’ brews but never the less a good beer."
"O: Definitely one of the better trappists, but so unusual it's hard to brand it as thus. Nice roastiness that's reminiscent of a decent stout, but it's mostly the muddy brown color and strange powdery mouthfeel that just don't do it for me. Would recommend and drink if given to me, but not likely buy again until it drops in price here, which is likely to happen in the next few years."

"I got this bottle from a friend who works at a distributor. I really wanted to like it- 8th trappist beer, from Austria, made with alsatian wine yeast, etc. etc., but it was just a boozy mess. Unimpressive appearance, strong phenols, and lackadaisical finish. At 9.7 abv it packs a punch, but it is a boring, slightly off, punch."
"OVERALL: This is quite good and somewhat unique in flavor for the style. Good and interesting flavor profile and a full, creamy feel for the style. The look could use some more work, but this is still a solid, solid beer. A wonderful addition to the trappiste lineup. Cheers again Doops!"

"A FaceBook alert had me out on the trail for this draft. Deep brown with a sweet head made this an attactive tulip. This is a complex, big beer but tart enough to desire a second. Although Belgian style through and through, the Austrian have provided enough of a different take to stand out. Thanks, Paul, for getting this one on."

"Overall: Quite different from the other Trappist ales I have had. It will be on the World Tour at the Winking Lizard in 2013 and I look forward to a second look."

"O. Fits the trappist mold pretty well, especially for a first try."
"Overall: A weird beer, but it does have some redeeming qualities (notably aroma and mouthfeel). The fermentation procedures and quantity of adjuncts do not seem to be typical. However, this beer does have a lot of potential."
"I had to start off with the newest Trappist brewery, didn't I? This stuff pours a clear topaz topped by over a finger of khaki foam. The nose comprises caramel, toffee, stone fruits, fig, and light clove. The taste brings in more of the same, though unfortunately accompanied by some musty apple/white wine grape character throughout. This flavor just ruins everything, literally leaving a bad taste in my mouth. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a fluid feel. Overall, it seemed as though the Local Option crew agreed with me that this beer, though well-looked-forward-to, really fell flat on its face, especially with that weird flavor in there (which is exacerbated by the alcohol level). Without any hesitation, this is the worst Trappist beer I've ever had. Hopefully I can try more from this brewery in the future, though (meaning: Engelszell, don't try to be Orval, 'cause this nonsense ain't no Orval, homies!)."

"O- A very interesting beer, it definitely sets itself apart from its Belgian counterparts, definitely give this a try, although the fruity, rich sweetness makes it a sipper."
"I have a couple bottles of this, and I'd like to cellar at least one to see how it holds up over the years, seeing how it is the first commercially available batch from Stift."

"PS the alcohol tends to make it more of a winterbeer"
