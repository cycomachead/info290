"If you're into Belgian beers, this hits the mark. It's not my preferred style, but tasty nonetheless. Roasty, toasty malts and some sweetness from the sugars and yeast make this a decent beer. I'd stick to the RR sours though if I had a choice."

"Draft @ City Beer Store on 1/19/15.  Pours a dark brown/burgundy with minimal tan head.  Aroma of malty, raisin sweetness with some banana, cola nut and spice.  Mouthfeel is medium bodied and creamy.  Palate of dark fruit, malty sweet, cola and spice.  Well balanced dark belgian with great aroma and flavor."

""
""
"I was surprised how dark this poured a nice dark brown. The flavor was really nice the hops and malts were perfect together. I'm glad i have another one of these to enjoy."
""
""
""
""
"O: I thoroughly enjoyed this one."
""
"Batch 6 bottled January 2008 and consumed a few days short of seven years later. This one is aging wonderfully. Dark fruits, brown sugar, yeast. Solid brew."

"o - another complex winner from RRB."
""
"O: Overall, excellent beer. Very smooth, refined and slightly dry. This isn't as thick as other top and readily available beers in this category, but it does drink VERY well. Will drink again when the opportunity arises."
""
""
""
"Worth a purchase if you see it."
"Smells like dark cherry, granola, and almonds. Bottle was purchased in 2012 at the brewery. Nice brown body with a light creamy head. Taste is similar to smell with dark fruit, nuttiness, and some grain. Really interesting beer and enjoyable. Not sure what age did if anything."

"Note: Some detail has been lost, since I tried this a while back. Also, I tried this with 15 other beers, half of which were sours in a sampler at Russian River. I highly recommend doing so, if you live reasonably close to Santa Rosa, CA."
""
""
""
""
""
"Not a favorite of mine because I like, either, more sweetness or more richness. Or both. The spice elements are nice. But, I'm a little disappointed in Russian River right now."

"solid beer but not the best I've had from RR, impressed by how well they made the booze vanish, this one went straight to my head"
""
""
""
""
"Bottom Line: Legendary beer!"
""

"Overall: One of the best. Happy to have made this my 600th review. Wish I had more. Might have to grab 2 next time."

"Enjoyable beer from Russian River. I liked this one better than NG's 20th Anniversary Ale, for instance. In terms of BSDAs, this is probably one of the better ones I've had. Highly recommend trying if you get the chance."
""
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel is good, full bodied. Nice carbonation level, a little rough and earthy. The flavors overall mesh well together, a nice dry finish. Pretty drinkable, a nice sipper. Good beer from Russian River, thanks for the sweet extra Geoff."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pretty good beer."
""

"Overall: The single best BSDA made in North America, delicious. If you like the style this one is a must try."

"Overall- Another winner from Russian River. Haven't had a bad beer by them yet!"

"Verdict: A nice Belgian Strong Dark Ale from Russian River that vastly improves as it warms. It does lack the deep complexity from a more authentic Belgian Dark, but this is one of the premier examples made domestically and a worthy brew for any Belgian lover."
"Feel [4.25]: Fairly acidic. Well carbonated. Slightly chewy. Goes down nice for the style and abv, maybe a little too easily."
"O - a well made BDSA that is relatively conservative in flavor and aroma. Not nearly as impressive as Rochefort, etc."

"O-A good beer for the style. Not my favorite however. To much licorice/prune taste that does not leave a pleasant after taste."
"O- A very good offering, like all of the Russian River -tions. Solid and worth a try."
"Just trying to keep it within the lines. This is one hell-ova beer. Served fresh at the wonderful Russian River Brewery pub, only one word for this, if you understand Belgian Style Dark ale, excellent. Perfectly balanced, subtle but substantial. Sweetness controlled by excellent malts and the background caramel simply teases the taste buds for a smooth finish that lingers on a tantalizing thread of wonderful elegance. Word association: chocolate, molasses, cherry, black grape. One review of this Salvation said this is not an everyday beer, it's a very substantial 9% ABV, lets hope it doesn't get to be too everyday. It is a sip and enjoy a beautifully crafted jewel from RR Brewing Co."
""
""
"on tap a much nicer brew; not so figgy fruitcake"
"Overall - A lovely beer. Nice, complex flavor that, unlike several of it's Dark Belgian counterparts, doesn't fall victim to an oversaturation of sugary sweetness. Great balance. This is one I'll definitely have to revisit when I make it up to the RR pub."
""
""
""
"Overall, excellent beer. Perfect balance of sweet and roasted. Huge fan."
""
""
""
"O - I feel like this is a very good representation of the style with good depth of flavor. However, style is just not for me."
""
""
""
""
""
"Quite a subtle brew in some ways, and well balanced. Yeah, everything gets a look-in here, and it's very nicely crafted. Doesn't really sing to me, and yet I feel like there's a lot of love in this beer."

"On tap at the brewery this beer is served in a goblet with a thin skimmed layer of tan head. Clear and garnet. Aromas of rich toasted malt and hints of estery banana belgian yeast. Taste is decidedly Belgian. Rich malt backbone with a sturdy enough yeast character to carry the flavors thru. The malt is s bit heavy on the dark barley malt which has plenty of roast and slight chocolate flavors. Smooth in body with the alcohol well hidden into the finish of this brew. A nice beer. Better than many of RR other ventures into the world of yeasty Belgian beers this beer has some character and decently complex flavors."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a solid example of the style. What I enjoy the most about this brew is that it has better than average balance. For example, the Belgian yeast does not overpower. It's great to be able to taste the malt backbone. My only critique is that I would like the alcohol to be better hidden. At the same time, it's not as off-putting as I have experienced from other Belgian Strong brews."
"Overall: A good beer for the style. not my usual but a good all around beer."
""
""
"In a trade from a very generous trader. Batch 11 printed on the corked and caged bottle. Poured 1/25/13. Dark brown with very little light coming through. Very very creamy kahki colored head. Aroma of raisins, cherries, and possibly a hint of smoke. Belgian yeast comes through and this gives of fruit qualities of a dubbel or quad. Some prickle up front from the carbonation and spice as a blast of fruit heads down your throat. Plums and berries all over. Very smooth. Finishes with a burst of unexpected chocolate and a lingering nuttiness. Chocolate really starts coming out with some more sips. Pretty thick mouthfeel, bigger than a porter but less than an impy. So creamy. I liked this!"
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This beer has a nice mix of dark fruits and yeasty flavors. No traces of alcohol are detectable."
"O: This is an interesting beer but not one of the best examples for the style in my opinion. I was hoping for a little more sourness in this brew but it did not come through for me in this one. Not the easiest to drink, more of a slow sipping beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O: A superb BSDA. One that begs to be sipped and enjoyed. Could enjoy another one soon."

"This Russian River Winter seasonal pours a deep, dark brown, and it is capped by a fluffy, off-white head and a good deal of clingy lace. Dark fruit (plum, raisin, and plums), candied sugars, and Belgian yeast create a classic Belgian Strong Dark ale nose. The flavors follow the dark fruit and candied sugar from the nose, with a good bit of breadiness as well. This 9% ABV brew is medium in body with a prickly carbonation."
""
""
""
"Perhaps more depth in the flavor and finish would really knock this out of the park for me - it's almost there! This is definitely something I would love to drink again. Great balance and that's what counts the most!"
"O: A great Belgian Strong Dark that isn't very sweet, which I like and has a bit of a tartness which I really like."
"overall this is a decent offering from russian river.. one of their weaker beers i've had - hell they're only human!! still pretty high rating for their ""decent"" beer.. i want to try avery's salvation next since i already had the collaboration ale between them."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I liked this beer except for the price tag. It is moderately flavorful and has an incredible feel but the muted aroma and heavy yeasty nature keep it from being top-tier."
""
""
"O: To my surprise but in a good way, this was totally different than what I was expecting. Low carbonation, great great aromas, and mild smooth taste made this RR brew quite enjoyable. I might have to get a growler next time instead of just a single 330ml bottle."

"Medium body, slightly creamy, good lively carbonation."
"more affordable than some of the othe beers in this series, unless i got lucky. paid just under 7 bucks for a 12.7oz. pours dark brown, thin looking, with a big bubble white head on top with pretty good retention. the nose is like coffee cake or fruit bread or something. lots of interestign spice and fruit from the yeast, which seems to be the dominant smell, in front of a nice chocolatey malt body. the flavor is equally yeast forward, not quite as spicy as the nose, but there is a lot going on here. also quite a bit of sweetness from the malts, roasty and dark, molasses, booze. the mouthfeel is lovely. very active carbonation makes it feel lighter than it is, and the fuller body does not prevent drinkability. i also love the aftertaste on this. overall another real solid russian river brew, but not my favorite from this line."

"O: Great balance going on here - not too dry yet not too sweet."

"O- A great beer from RR! It's a nice change to see some darker beers in bottles from them. I plan on snagging a few bottles of this soon!"
"This poured a rich malty dark hue with creamy foam. There’s aromas of plums—stone fruit, really, followed by a flavor with hints of tobacco & plum. I get some coffee as it warms, a light molasses, and leather mixed in with the stone fruit. There’s a sweet tinge to this and a delicate malt characteristic. Terribly enjoyable."
""
""
"O- This definitely wasn't my favorite beer from Russian River, but it was fairly well done even though the tastes weren't exactly to my liking. There was a decent amount of dark fruits balanced with some light spices rounded out with out with an almost candy like sweetness. Everything was fairly well balanced, but I wasn't a huge fan of the dark fruits. I enjoyed this but I probably wouldn't try to get it again."
""
""
""
"O - Salvation is a pretty enjoyable beer - not one of the best Russian River beers I've had, but proof positive how great a brewery they are."
"Overall: I thought there was some interest in the smell and some complexity as well, but the taste really didn't match up. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed it, but I'm not sure it lived up to the hype Russian River typically garners."
""
"O: It's a Russian River bottle-aged ale. What are you waiting for?"
"O- Rediculous! Enough said!"
""
""
""
"Recommend to try."
""
""
"Overall: another nice beer from RR. The Belgian character is excellent and the malt base and dark fruits are well integrated."
""
"Taste is sweet belgian malt and dried fruit, corriander, banana, and chocolate flavors. Really nicely mellow and balanced...just a good all around beer. Worth a try and then another!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Russian River doesn't make bad beer; Salvation is further proof of this."
""
""
"D - This one has a lot of really nice complexity and was fun to drink. Really rich and full of nice flavors that weave in and out of one another gracefully. Great BSDA from this side of the Atlantic."
"I didn't realize as I was first drinking it that this was the same Salvation that was blended with Avery's to make Collaboration, Not Litigation. That only dawned on me as I searched for this to review. CNL is an awesome brew too, so no wonder this is awesome."
""
"O- I continue to be impressed with Russian River. Their beers are well worth trying."

"Overall, a nice strong dark ale."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O. Solid, but nothing more. The appearance looks like dreck and the mouthfeel is overly carbed. The nose and flavor are pretty good, but it's a little boozy and unrefined. Needs some more bready malt to balance out the sweet fruit. Worth a visit, but probably not a repeat."
""
"O: Lots of nice malty fruit flavor. Bonus points for bring lighter in body than the typical Belgian, which improves the drinkability."
""
"A very good take on the style, showcasing depth and complexity. Delicious."
"D - Very drinkable. Really nice BSDA. The balance of flavors is really nice with the dark fruits and yeast flavors complementing each other nicely."
""
"375ml bottle courtesy of Callmecoon. Batch 010 served in my DT tulip. Pours a dull mahogany hue with a hazy clarity and a dense, 2.5 inch, tan-colored head. Head eventually settles into a sold, half inch cap with textured clusters of lacing revealed during the tasting. Nose expresses dark fruit, tannins, spice, candi sugar and toffee notes. There's also a trace of ethanol towards the back. Taste consistent with nose; however, there's also a bready quality. Dark fruit character (plums, figs, prunes) is more consistent with the skin than the meat and is interlaced with a considerable malty presence. Ethanol present in the nose is also manifested in the flavor profile. Mouthfeel is medium-ight in body with an assertive, almost prickly carbonation. There's also a bit of acidity to this beer. Overall, a solid offering from this brewer, but not my favorite. I would, however, like to see how this beer develops with some cellaring."
"Pretty good Belgian Dark Ale, but I've had better examples that are much easier to obtain for somebody out east. Was really hoping for more due to all the praise RR receives."
""
""
"Overall this is a delicious well constructed bsda. Excellent."
"O- A great beer from RR! It's a nice change to see some darker beers in bottles from them. I plan on snagging a few bottles of this soon!"
""
""
""
"The finesse and dry finish of this brew are amazing for 9% abv!"
""
"Overall - Really good flavors with a bit too much yeastiness and off flavors killing what could be really tremendous. Otherwise, it's pretty damn good, though."
""
"Another winner from Russian River. Perhaps my favorite of their Belgian styles, would love to have again down the road. Thanks stupac2."
""
""
"Overall I would say this is good for a try. You'll find better Belgian darks out there. Could be more impressive when fresh, but I don't have that luxury."
"O: Wonderful beer. This is definitely the penultimate winter beer. I am wonderfully impressed."
""
""
""
"Overall, this was even better than I expected - and I've come to expect a lot from Russian River. A very solid BSDA, among the best I've had."
""
""
""
"O-a tasty Belgian dark ale, but a little too sweet and carbonated to be among my favorites"
""
"This is a top notch beer and can compete with the best. If you can find it, drink it."
""
""
"Den"
""
""
"Overall: This is a fantastic smelling beer. I felt like the flavor lost some of the complexity that was showing up in the smell. Good and I would have another but not spend a ton of time searching it out."
""
""
"Review from 5/2011 notes. Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Pours a dark mahogany brown. Thick two finger light brown head with foamy lacing. Aroma of dark fruit, malt and a bit of spice. Flavor of malt, dark fruit, somewhat subdued. Finish is a bit dry and spicy with no distinct spices. Thick and creamy. An interesting, if understated ale. Flavor progression somewhat abrupt from dark fruit, malt to dry spice. Well made and may be worth cellaring one to see if it balances out."
""
""
"Overall, not one of my favorite styles, but Salvation is the best strong dark I've had so far and I'll pick up another bottle again if I can."
""
"I liked the smoky flavor i'm getting from this, and I don't remember that in having this beer before. A very nice dark ale."
""
"O: This is pretty good stuff for what it is. I wish the carbonation was knocked back about 2 volumes. Still a nice beer from RR, and one that would be interesting to age for a while as I really like the coffee/roasted flavor that lingers on the finish."
""
"Overall: I liked it better than I expected, but this is still not an outstanding Belgian ale. The flavor is a little lacking and the carbonation is a tad too heavy, but it does drink rather well."
""
"Serving type: bottle"
""
""
"M/D - medium bodied with a good amount of carbonation. Its slightly syrupy but not in a detracting way. Very enjoyable to drink though I think the sweetness might end up being a hinderance towards the end of the bottle."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is the first Belgian-style ale I've ever tried from Russian River. Impressive!"
"O: A goodish beer, but not one of my favourites. I would maybe recommend it, but I wouldn't have another."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Its alright. Nothing I'd rave about, nothing I'd seek out again."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Overall a very sumptuous beer. Really delicious, with a great combination of flavors. One of the best Belgian Strong Dark Ales I have had. Choosing between this and Maudite is difficult, but I think I'll give it to the Canadians in this round. Great beer."

"Overall: A very good and complex Belgian Strong Dark Ale. Not the best from Russian River I have had but one of the better in the style. Its dryness would only make me want one glass at a time though. This one has elements of a Flanders Oud Bruin which I enjoy. I will look for this the next time I am in the Philly area."

"On tap at Capone's Black Friday event. This poured out as a pretty nice looking dark reddish brown color with a thin white head on top. The smell of the beer wasn't funky at all which I was really happy about. The taste of the beer had some really nice dark fruity flavors with some vanilla in the mix. The flavors that this brew has are rather impressive. The mouthfeel of the beer is pretty thin a but not watered down at all. Overall this brew is great I think. One of the best from Russian River I think."
"O: I dug Russian River's Salavation. Not their best beer by any stretch of the imagination, but it's a well put together little beer that I look forward to having again. Don't let me stop you from getting into this one - thumbs up."

"This is a fine beer but the cost on the east coast is a bit prohibitive. I would probably turn to Rochefort 8 nine times out of ten in the future as it’s nearly half the cost per bottle and maybe slightly better. Worth a shot for sure, though."
""
""
"It's strange. Everything about this beer is strong, except for that odd taste that comes on half-way through. But that takes it down a huge notch for me."
"""Batch: 010"""
"O: Pretty good beer. Probably not something I would go to often, but done well with a solid flavor profile."
"Salvation may not have the depth of some of the classic Belgian dark strongs, but it boasts a straightforward flavor and mouthfeel that brings an irrepressible smile to my lips. Quality stuff."
"Overall, very true to the style of a classic Belgian dark ale. Very well rounded, great flavors. Another great beer from RR."
"HV"
"O: This is tasty, but by no means the best BSDA I've had. It defines the style pretty well though."
"A very solid beer, while it didn't blow me away like some other RR beers, it is quality."
"D: Vinny don't play. Every style he makes well. Really impressed with this one and I have waited a long time to try it. Very nice."
"Had a bottle at the Spinnerstown Hotel. It poured a deep reddish brown with a tall tan head. The beer was a touch overcarbonated off the bat, but it eventually settled down. It had big fruit up front that reminded me of Unibroue's dark offerings with a rich fig and berry taste. The beer feels light though, and is backed by smooth, dry caramel. I'd like a bit more complexity, but this is still one of the best American-made Belgian-style ales."
"D - Very mellow, easy drinking Belgian dark ale. The alcohol however is well hidden and sneaks up fast. Although the flavors are rather subtle, I thoroughly enjoyed this beer and is a fine example of the style. It leaves you wanting more after every sip."
"Overall I can see where this gets its accolades, but it is also my least favorite Russian River offering to date. Ohh wait a tick... I still need to review Blind Pig. Erm, tick Blind Pig ;-)"
"Overall, this is a great beer and true to the style. A good intro beer for people who want to get into what a Belgium style can offer."
"Bottle to tulip. Appearance is good; looks like a Belgian strong. Smell is average; nothing special here. Taste is average too when comparing it to barreled brews; slightly above average otherwise. Mouthfeel is its best feature, which let me be clear, is not a good thing. I do love the carbonation of sours though. Overall, an overhyped Russian River brew that's a disappointment - especially for the price tag."
"Drink- This was pretty good. Not the best beer from RR but I liked it. I haven’t had too many of there base series without sour so this was good."
"Note: I had another bottle of this the other night and was still was left wanting more. I edited my original taste rating from 4 down to 3.5."
"O: This beer is amazing and should be enjoyed now. It is a very sessionable Dark Belgian Quad which drinks like a sweet, raisiny brown ale. This is quite amazing, it has a rich full malty background that is not overly sweet. This beer is amazing!"
"O- Complex beer, another solid beer from Russian River, not the best Belgium Strong Dark Ale I’ve had but definitely a quality brew."
"So I'm scoring it decently, but I'm unimpressed. I can't knock any particular quality but I just don't love, or even really like it. If you're like me maybe you should ""save"" your money."
"Love RR and most of their beers, wish I loved this one. Oh well, you can't love everything."
"D - A definite let down in terms of both the style and the continual high expectations of Russian River... Not terrible, but not something I would opt for nor recommend in the future... The 9% ABV is surprisingly well hidden... Far from a drain pour, but I was very happy (and not in a good way) once this one was completed..."
"O: Good, but nothing amazing."
"EDIT: After rating this one, I felt like maybe I was off-base a little...BUT then I read some of the other reviews below and people said things like ""Not my favorite RR brew"" and gave it a ""B" so I think I'm on par here, maybe just being a little more ""honest"" with my rating."
"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was its sweetness. Although at first the flavoring appears to be almost too sweet, as the tasting progresses and things meld together what is presented is a supremely well blended and balanced beer. Even more surprising is how successful this rendition of the style is coming from an American brewery. This brew stays wonderfully to the style, but is quite fresh and impressive."
"Review #667, poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a snifter, batch 10. The pour is murky brown with a fizzy 2 inch white head, leaves pillows of lace. The aroma sweet dark fruit. The flavors of dark fruit are prevalent, some alcohol, finishes dry. The body is medium, good carbonation. Decent ale, there are better ones available"
"poured from bottle into RR tulip. The color is a rich burgundy with a nice 1/2 inch head with a little bit of lacing present. Took several drinks before I could describe the taste. Tobacco and dark fruits are the most prevelant taste. Very bubbly, almost dances off the tounge. Faint alchohol resonance. NOt my favorite, a well put together beer, just not one for me."
"O: I like this beer, I'm interested in the prospect of aging this beer. Interesting little bugger."
"A smooth yet strong dark ale with nice esters and malt character. Well balanced."
"I love Russian River-- but this is officially the worst beer I've had from them. They have a stellar lineup of beers, and the -ation beers are particularly enjoyable... This one however is just barely drinkable by comparison. This is am average beer from an outstanding brewery. Perhaps it is my fault for having set the bar too high..."
"O- very nice beer. Good flavors that balance well. Would drink this again for sure."
"O ~ Smooth and warm with abundant tastes and smells Would enjoy with a nice juicy steak. Especially grew on me towards the end. Will definitely enjoy this beverage again!"
"Overall: Nice beer from Russian River. Wish that the carbonation was a bit much, but I would not change to much else here. Solid brew!"
"Overall, I love this beer. I want to try some with some age on them to see which flavors start coming out as the alcohol fades into the background."
"Unlike the other RR sours I've had this is not dominated by the sourness, rather, it is balanced by the dark fruits normally found in a belgian dark ale. The sourness blends well with the fruits to give a completely different character to the beer, which is defined less by dark, ripe fruits and more by fresh, unripe fruits."
"Thanks to hurfer for the opportunity. "
"O-An amazing beer. Not the most overwhelming in flavor but full of nuanced flavors."
"The mouthfeel is on the heavier side with carbonation being moderate. Overall this was an excellent beer that aged very nicely. I really loved the dark fruit, raisin flavors to it. One of the better versions of the style I've had and probably the best American brewed one that I can remember having."
"Overall: a very good beer; though, like I said, it reminds me a little more of a dubbel. Nothing wrong with that, though."
"O: This is a great beer to just relax and really dive into. It would be a real treat on a cold winter night sitting by the fire. Its also great proof that Russian River does more than just really hoppy or really sour beer. A great American-made Belgian."
"Pours very dark amber, hints of chestnut. Nose is simply incredible with spicy baked desserts, herbal notes, hop tingle, and a musty attic component that is enchanting. Some tea flavors appear on the palate, sourness, brown bread, baked holiday desserts, and holiday spices. Silky smooth mouthfeel with abundance of carbonation. Long finish, sour."
"Russian River products are not simply about deliverance from mass-produced beers, they are an entirely higher power of beer consumption. These ales - masterpieces, really - are the mark of an artisan and, unlike industrial products, are intended to be shared and savored. They are redemption for the years where fizzy, light lagers dominated store shelves and honest, artistic products were run out by multi-million dollar ad campaigns. They offer true salvation."
"Overall: Masterfully-brewed, extremely well-balanced Belgian Strong Dark Ale. I have a feeling there's no such thing as a bad Russian River beer... Two things that bode well for this one are: 1. it's a stellar brew to begin with, and 2. it's not put through the shipping/storage punishment that its Belgian counterparts are."
"-Cheers"
"o - overall a good beer. nice take on the style, but not russian river's best. as a big fan of the style i'm glad i tried it. this beer is far better than most other american takes on the style, but doesn't hold a candle to the originals."
"Overall not bad, dry and malty, lots of dry belgian crazy yeast flavors and aromas, and light spices."
"Overall, I was very impressed with the balance in this beer. Most of its characteristics were very bold, but the diversity in smells, tastes, and mouthfeel qualities offset each other nicely, and the result is a strong ale that drinks easily, finishes pleasantly, and leaves you wanting more. Of course, it's no surprise with the quality of beers the RR consistently attains. Bravo!"
"Like the other two I've had in D.C., it's hard to find a flaw beyond the price. Grab it when you can, and hopefully for something shy of $10."
"O- A very good beer, but I can think of several Begian Stong Darks ales I'd much rather have than this. Not my favorite from RR."
"Drinkability is pretty high, it's so smooth and flavourful. Layers of complexity I just didn't have time to get into, I'd love another chance to explore this one. Amazing stuff."
"A nice modern example of a belgian classic. A little to bubbly for me but overall still a great beer that stands out in the crowd of belgian style american craft beer."
"Well built."
"O - Really nice offering and it was nice to try another Belgian style offering from Vinnny and the crew. Passed this one so many times, I'm glad I finally picked it up."
"Incredibly drinkable, probably incredibly well-pairing."
"Pours a deep amber to black, with a tan head. In the aroma, white grape sourness and some candi sugar. In the taste, dry candy sugar, a small tartness, and with hints of fruit. A sour bite and medium bodied mouthfeel, with a dry candi sugar and small tartness in the aftertaste. Nice tart, but candi sugar overrides it, hides 9%, quite nice."
"O- A truly outstanding Belgian style ale. The flavors are just incredible, it gives some of the best abbey beers a run for their money."
"O-a very decent stab at the belgian tradition from a great american brewery. i still personally prefer the belgians themselves though.it was fun to drink but i would only drink this as a cheaper alternative to Chimay."
"A decent belgian strong ale...Id prefer a little less spiciness, carb and alcohol taste but still a solid overall beer. I expect nothing less than ""solid"" from RR and this delivers, but regardless it might be my least favorite brew I've had. I'd rather stick to their hoppy IPAs or sours."
"O: I would have to argue this is one of the best Belgian strong dark ales/Quads produced in America to date. Everything flows amazingly together to produce one awesome ride."
"Massive thanks goes out to billinlafayette for sending me a bottle of this in a past trade as it is another tick on my Russian River -tion Quest! Batch 006! Served from bottle into a Russian River -tion Chalice (how appropriate). Poured a deep red brown with a two finger cream colored headed that subsided to one finger slowly. Maintained phenomenal lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, spices, dark fruit, and dark chocolate. The flavor was of sweet malt, wood, spices, dark fruit, and dark chocolate. It had a medium feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this wasn't a bad brew at all. If I'm honest my palate went into shock on the first sip as it was a little harsh. It started to 'adjust' after about three sips and the beer became much more palateable. This one was quite complex and everything blended quite well together. The spices were definitely present and reminded me of a Saison only not as harsh. But the dark fruit and dark chocolate helped to tone the spices down quite a bit leaving a nice sweet/bitter combo going on. Definitely worth trying if you get the chance."
"mouthfeel - smooth, medium to light body, good carbonation, leaves mouth pretty wet"
"Delicious but I think I would prefer an older bottle."
"I can't believe it took me so long to finally try this beer. For $5 it's a steal. The sours always get more hype but beers like this are why Russian River is the best brewery in the U.S."
"O: Very nice belgian strong dark beer. Sweet but not overly so. Alcohol well hidden except for the drying aftertaste."
"Overall, Vinnie does not make a bad beer, while some may be better than others, they are all to style and fit perfectly. Salvation is no different, it sets out what it wants to do, and that is be a BSDA. I need to track down a bottle or two more for a two year nap in the basement because this will do wonders with some time, like most RR bottles. I just need more restraint so I don't open it up, this is too good."
"O- overall, i find this to be an acceptable example of this style but not the most complex. good for an american effort, which is not the typical russian river result."
"The carbonation is perfect for the style and the beer is extremely drinkable. Proof that Russian River is one of the best breweries in America when it comes to brewing Belgian-style beers."
"Salvation pours a rich, deep plum color, with some very attractive cherry highlights shining through and tracing the outer edge of the glass. There's a voluminous, dirty ivory foam crown topping the beer. It gets up to about 4 fingers in height before very slowly creeping down the glass. Lacing is very spotty though. The nose is pungent as all hell, and is everything I'd want in a BSDA. The dark fruitiness is what shows up first, figs and plums and a little bit of bruised banana abound. A solid clove spiciness comes in to act as a counterpart, and I can't imagine a better balance between the two. The flavor brings more of the same, though everything doesn't quite pop as much as in the aroma. The body is picture perfect, remarkably creamy for what really is a dry beer. The carbonation isn't quite expansive and active enough to match with the best Belgian style brews though. Despite one or two minor missteps, Salvation is one of the absolute best dubbels/BSDAs/quads I've ever had. I was quite shocked to see it's 9%ABV, as it drinks a bit smoother than that. I'll definitely be seeking out more of this."
"I'm happy to have tried this, especially as an extra!"
"Salvation is further proof that Russian River can make good beer that is neither sour nor hoopy. If you hadn't seen the bottle, you might have thought this was from a traditional Belgian abbey."
"O - Ok, but a little too sweet, almost on the verge of being cloying. One glass was enough."
"Overall: Most definitely a sipper and a beer that would be better in the winter as opposed to the warmer humid night (but that's my fault, not the beer's); great flavors and a big warming presence of alcohol, this would make for a great after dinner treat, or split it with a friend for a nice night cap. While I'm definitely enjoying it, this one would have be had in strict moderation due to the warmth and ABV. Nice offering from Russian River, as I've come to expect from them."
"Should have this on tap at the brewery but bought a bottle instead and here goes....Pours a dirty brown with a nice off-white foamy head. Fruity aroma with apples, pears, bananas, figs, slight coffee and slight leather....and a whiff of chocolate. The taste is way too carbonated with bubbles taking over the entire sip but after the bubbles die down there is a dark fruit taste with a tobacco-like swallow and almost a cigarette taste. Mouthfeel is lower as too much is going on to really enjoy the drink as much as possible. Overall I wasn't too impressed with this effort. Too much carbonation was happening to enjoy the experience. I will definitely try at the source and see if this is a bottle issue. Worthy but just a little disappointed."
"Overall it had good drinkability. No signs of ABV."
"This is my second Salvation in about a month or so. Overall a quality beer but I have other belgians I'd go to first, as well as other RR offerings."
"O: Excellent. Highly recommended. The sum is certainly greater than the parts and I wish that I had more than one more bottle. Could drink a couple slowly consumed bottles happily over the course of an evening."
"Rating: 94 out of 100"
"Overall another nice ale from Russian River, well balanced, defined and consistent throughout."
"9% abv shouldn’t be this harsh, intense, or any of this. If Russian Rivers wants me to wait a few years to drink this they should put a best after date to let me know not to open it. I think age will help this beer but this beer needs a LOT of help."
"pours a really dark color, especially for a BSDA. Near black, but with a bluish hue. Very light tan head that pours strong. fresh belgian spices in the smell. hints of fruit and cinnamon in the smell. taste is different than most BSDAs. a little bit of toffee. spicier than most and a little lighter, especially in the mouthfeel. overall, not my favorite BSDA. I've grown accustomed to the similarity in yeast strains of the most popular brands and this differs significantly to the point of being too ""different."" I get the same feel, but it's not the same."
"This is a good brew. It is smooth and flavorful without being very powerful."
"Overall its a good BSDA. Going to age a few to see what this one can do."
"O - Nice Belgian-style, maybe could have used darker flavors and stronger profile."
"375 ml bottle. Batch 10. Pours a dark brown with a small very light tan head that sticks around for a while and leaves a good amount of lacing on the glass. Aroma is big dark fruit with raisin and plum, spicy Belgian yeast, candi sugar, and a breadiness. The initial taste has a sweetness with some candi sugar then goes into some raisin and plum. The finish has a breadiness with some spicy yeast. Medium body. Low carbonation."
"O - Beer is better than average, but I'm not a huge fan. At 9% it's decently drinkable, but this is probably one of my least favorite Russian River offerings."
"The mouth is smooth upfront, followed by a sizzle of carbonation and a resonating dryness. It's restrained for the style and I feel like it's tasty and original enough to go head to head with any of Belgian's top ales."
"Cheers!"
"Really balanced with almost no discernable boozy character. Sweet (but not too sweet), easy-drinking, and delicious!"
"D - extremely drinkable: very smooth, not too sweet, not too bready, not too alcoholic. Not the best BSDA I've had, but pretty exceptional and well-balanced."
"Overall this was an odd one, there was nothing really bad at all about it, but it just did not really stand out to me as anything fantastic other the very smooth nature of it. Almost silk like it was solo smooth. This was definitely a nice triple, but to be honest I have had better. Thats ok though it is still a very good beer and something I would say you should definitely try if given the chance."
"Overall an excellent version of the style. It's a little expensive at $6.99 but worth a try if you enjoy the style."
"O: ABV a little daunting. Solid strong dark; flavorful, nice balance of malt and yeast characters."
"D: This is a must try for anybody. Despite the higher ABV, this complex beer is easy to drink."
"Big thanks go out to kevinv for hooking me up with this long time want as an extra! Pours a very dark mahogany brown color with a HUGE three finger head that becomes rocky and frothy in the Duvel tulip. I don't think this head is ever going away! Thick rings of lacing everywhere. Damn, this looks great! Aroma decidedly Belgian in essence, lots of grain, straw, yeast, caramelized sugar, a touch of chocolate, and light booziness. Very nice! MmmMmmm! Yep, delicious caramelized wort in the flavor, along with some raisin, milk chocolate (which is surprising), a touch of banana, more grassiness, red wine, and a chalky Belgian yeast finish. Yep, this is damn good, and about as close as one can get to the true examples (St Bernie Abt, Rochie 10, etc). Carbonation is very lively and rather sting-y, had to do a lot of swirling to get this where I wanted it, and the result is a lucious, creamy, sweet, full-bodied brew. Yep, this is great stuff. Another RR brew that does not disappoint. Thank again for this one, Kevin!"
"The beer is chestnut / mahogany in color, with a full figured head that leaves a healthy amount of lacing on the glass. The aroma consists of yeast, malt, dark fruits, spices. The flavor is well balanced and pleasant. This doesn't quite measure up to the great, authentic versions of the style, but is quite enjoyable nonetheless. The feel is really smooth on the palate, with alcohol content well hidden. Overall, another solid effort from one of America's finest breweries."
"All and all one of my least favorites from Russian River but hey it isn't bad by any means."
"Overall: Not bad, just nothing that stood out to me. Worth the lower $6 price for a RR beer but i'd gladly pay the $12 for any of their sours before this one again."
"O - I want another one. Or two. But the wife only bought me one."
"D- Lively carbonation, a touch oily in the mouth."
"Batch 10. The beer pours a very dark brownish red, with a fluffy white head that sticks around for most of the beer. Smell is full of belgian yeast, some banana, clove, and dark fruit. Taste is nice: fruity, earthy, not much booze, pretty solid. Mouthfeel is a little bit thin, with high carbonation, and finishes pretty dry for a belgian strong dark. Overall this was a nice, american made, belgian dark ale. This, along with a couple of Allagash beers are the best american efforts at the style I've had. They just don't quite stand up to the originals. I would gladly have this one again though."
"Just an average Strong Ale. Really not much else to say about this one."
"Taste, damn thick fruitcake like bread with dates in it. Turned me off, reminded me of that crappy stuff that gets put on the table to eat around the holidays. Clove sticks its head out. One aspect I was able to appreciate was the edge of cocao. Still can't overcome the date and plum dominance. One of my least favorite Russian River beers (drank this at the brewery). Come to think of it, this IS my least favorite."
"O: Was impressed but not blown away, waited a while to try a RR beer and it is good for the hype. A very nice Belgian beer, but not the best"
"This is a cloudy blond unfiltered beer with almost no head. No problem though, the beer is good with some nice spices in it. We enjoyed this beer Matt, thanks!"
"Although not a bad beer, it seems to be a bit vacant."
"Narrative: ""we should do this more ofTEN!"" you open up your posture and lean hesitantly back ""oh yeah...i know why dont we, yeah we should!"" a slight wavering in your voice. This was all going so well, but God does she grate on your nerves relentlessly. ""I've got this thing next month and you know, the week is always hectic"" you look down at your shoes, the lies in the air palpable in a thick mist that she seems impervious to. ""well totally, I will work around you, I will call you tomorrow ok? 2 pm?"" You can't believe you are still standing in the entryway of this apartment complex, this could not end soon enough, yet it started so pleasantly. Maybe it was the way she smacked her food, told the same story 6 times with slight variations, smacked her gum, or asked you prying personal questions. ""Yeah no 2pm is rough, pretty much all times are tough, so hey I gotta do this thing but...keep in touch k?..."" You rock back on your heels and slink towards your car. ""Sure, well I will touch back and we'll work something out"" For all your will, for all her shortcomings, you know in 6 months, your curiousity will return and you will inevitably come back to her. The exotic sweetness, with all its lack of grace, becons."
"O: Would definitely say this is a solid American take on the BSDA style. Has its ups and downs and certainly is no Chimay Blue, but for $6-7 a bottle it may be something to revisit."
"D/O - Drinkability is high. For a brewery half a world away from Belgium, Russian River certainly doesn't disappoint with this beer. In terms of the buying again in the future, I'd like to stock up some for aging, but as I can't get this near me, I will have to seek out some alternatives that can compete with this."
"D - very, for the style. It could be a little less drying, but overall not a lot of complaints about this offering from RR."
"O: This is a great example of an American Belgian-style SDA. I shared a three-year vertical at a past tasting, and found that the beer ages remarkably well: it becomes slightly drier, and flavors of plums and brown sugar develop. I've socked away a few bottles of this to recreate the experiment. I'm not bowled over by a young bottle, though."
"Well managed alcohol and smooth flavors, but this is still a sipper. Not the best RR or best of the style, but pleasant."
"a great offering from RR. delicious and highly drinkable. they hould sell these in a 4-pack"
"O: Great Belgian with huge character. Only wish it was available in the midwest."
"Missing some of the malt complexity you find in some of the world-class examples while still maintaining a very drinkable beer. More depth and complexity would help increase interest and this seems to lose its luster after a pint."
"Argh, some street vendor is cooking bacon wrapped hot dogs, onions and peppers and the aromas are wafting up here. Not exactly odors worthy of this brew. This is a nice offering, although up against some tough standard-setters for the style. I view Chimay Blue and Rochefort 8 as the benchmark by which I judge all other BSDAs. A very enjoyable beer, but probably a full rung below the gold standards."
"Worthy."
"I'll say that this is one of the better American made BSDAs. It has the color, body and carbonation down pat. At this juncture, however, the beer is very sweet and brash. Its still gonna look nice along side all of my other -ation bottles."
"A really solid Belgian strong dark ale."
"O: Wow. Russian River comes through once again."
"D - A bit too much for a session."
"The cpj"
"* Black BSPA is obviously a parody in response to Black IPA."
"Pours a murky dirty iced tea color with a 2 inch light tan head that fades to a small cap. Decent rings of lace that drizzle back down into the rest of the beer over time. Smells of dark fruits, spices, Belgian-type yeast, and oddly enough - rubber. The rubber scent I am getting is off-putting and detracts from the overall smell of the beer. Taste is of sweet dark fruits (plums/raisins), spices, and the typical Belgian yeast. Strong carbonation on the beer with a feel of thousands of tiny bubbles washing around in the mouth. A little bit of alcohol warming in the throat. Overall, this is a good beer but nothing too great in my opinion. I am glad I got to try this one as this is the first time I have seen this one in bottles in my area."
"Very much a Belgian Dark Ale, was a great example of the style."
"Pours a dark, reddish-brown color that is a clear ruby red when held up to light. Large white head that diminishes quickly. Scent is pleasant with intense dark fruit aromas and nice spicy scents. A bit of chocolate and booze as well. Taste is DELICIOUS! I was not expecting this beer to taste this good, as I'm normally just a fan of Russian River's sours and hoppy beers. Very lovely dark fruit flavors with a hint of brown sugar and chocolate. I also get some delicious malt and slightly roasted flavors. Great spices reign throughout. Mouthfeel is full bodied and well carbonated for this style. Almost perfect in body. Drinkability is high for such strong ABV, and alcohol is well hidden in the taste. Overall, this is just a fantastic Belgian-style ale from RR. Glad I was able to pick up a few 375ml bottle from the brewery this weekend."
"Overall: I had a Rochefort 8 a few nights ago that was not as good as this, but that could have been a bad bottle. This beer is balanced, clean and drinkable for its strength. A very well brewed beer, worth the $4."
"another wonderful beer from Russian River, it feels like trying to find any faults with any of their beers is like splitting hairs. not my favorite by them, but still very tasty."
"Overall - Pretty impressed with this beer. No alcohol noticeable in the flavor or throat. Can't wait to sit on a few of these for a few years and try them with some age on them."
"drinks easy, tastes a bit fresh, funk is far more subtle from the smell."
"O: Good but not great. Not very boozy for the high abv however I do feel it has flaws and thus I think I will not being having another anytime soon."
"Overalll: A solid rendition...I would revisit"
"Over all is this an amazing beer. Really one of the best that I have had. Can't wait to head over the Russian River to do a tasting up that way."
"Mouthfeel is a point of contention for me, as I'm torn between appreciating how rich and creamy the beer is, but also wish it was a little bit thinner and crisper at times. I guess excess fine carbonation allows for an awesome look, but not always the most balanced feel. Drinkability is tough to judge due to that, along with the flavors being strong but not completely pleasant, but it's definitely above average for the style. This isn't my favorite kind of beer, but I can appreciate a well made one."
"Probably going to lay a bottle or two down and see what happens in a year or so."
"O-Definitely not my favorite release from Russian River, but a solid rendition of the style that is very drinkable. If they could pull back a bit on the intensity of the clove flavor, I might like it a little more."
"Batch 10 poured into a tulip, the color of coca cola with a thin tan head. Beautiful aromas of freshly baked banana bread, vanilla coke, toasted candied coconut. Very in your face and complex on the nose with maybe a touch of sweet tea too. Roasted malts in the mouth with nice carbonation and a hoppy bitterness and a touch of spice - the initial nosing is really the star here. Definitely will be cracking some more of these open in the future, alcohol is well hidden and I tend to consider RR a bit too hyped but this is a very nice beer."
"O - This is a good Belgian Strong Dark Ale. In its class i think its a valiant effort from an American Brewer but falls a bit short from the Native Belgian brewers. I still thoroughly enjoyed this beer and would drink it again."
"Taste delivers very much the same. Sweet and smooth, nice tingle from the carbonation. Relatively quick on the palate, solid but not too complex."
"Pours a hazy medium to dark brown with a small tan head. I don't really have any idea what to make of what is to come. Unlike some of my colleagues, I thought this beer almost smelled like nothing. The little bit I picked up was Belgian yeast and minimal hop or other source bitterness. Not only was the nose a let down, but it gave me no idea what was to come. A touch of candied sugar accompanies that Belgian yeast flavor with a grainy dryness. I wasn't a fan of the first sip, but this beer grew on me a bit as I made my way through it. It went down fairly easy and had a decent mouthfeel, which I won't overly comment on having limited experience with the style. To me, this was an interesting beer that lacked something. As a relatively high ABV brew, I was expecting a bit more flavor or nuance. I didn't really feel there was enough of either."
"d - pretty easy to drink. no sharp flavors, just not my favorite flavor."
"I'd have to say this is the weakest of the Russian River beers I've tried, and yet it's still very solid and a good representation of the style despite the thin mouthfeel."
"Alcohol is well hidden on the taste despite catching whiffs of it on the nose. Fairly drinkable strong dark ale, but the complexity int he mouth is a bit lacking compared to other offerings similar to this. Good and I wouldn't mind drinking this again."
"D - extremely drinkable: very smooth, not too sweet, not too bready, not too alcoholic. Not the best BSDA I've had, but pretty exceptional and well-balanced."
"Pretty good, but I've not had many Quads. This was my fourth fairly strong beer of the evening, and even though I had been sharing I could use another shot at this beer. This is my least favorite Russian River beer so far."
"jd"
"Pours cloudy chestnut brown with a light tan head. The aroma has lots of caramel, dates, raisins and other dark fruits. Medium / full body that gets bigger on the finish and has a nice amount of sharp carbonation. The taste starts with lots of rich dark fruit, mainly dates and figs, and a nice balanced taste. The finish gets drier with a good amount of fruit and lingering funky earthy yeast taste..."
"D: even at the ABV it is very drinkable"
"Poured a deep reddish-brown color with a fluffy whitish head. Aromas of light brown sugar, cloves, golden raisins and bananas. Smooth and moderately sweet, with spicy yeast, a little hop, brown sugar, and dark fruits. I've always enjoyed this one as one of the components of Collaboration not litigation, and it is quite good on its own as well."
"EDIT: Batch 10 consumed fresh is better than the aged bottle I reviewed. Sweeter overall with more of an alcohol presence. I'd drinking this with only a slight bit of age on it rather than cellar it long term. -Cheers."
"D - Drinkability is pretty good for Salvation. For some reason, this one comes off immediately as a big brew that might qualify as a sipper. That's alright though. Lots of great flavors add much to the experience. This really is a well made Belgian style ale. Maybe it could benefit from 8% instead of 9% but that is just a minor qualm with a great brew. Russian River once again comes through."
"Poured a hazy caramel brown with a half finger of head and left good lacing sticking to the glass. The aroma consisted of pleasent belgian yeast notes with spices, caramel malts, slight booze, toffee, and faint cocoa notes. It also had hints of dark fruits llike figs and raisins. The taste was very similar to the nose with big belgian yeast character but had nice spice, slight cocoa, caramel, and toffee accents. There was some dark fruit flavors but it also had some boozy undertones on the tail end. The brew was medium body with a moderate amount of carbonation which had a slight toasty but sweet finish. It drank really good and I'm glad to have had the opportunity to tried multiple times."
"It's hard to find fault with Russian River Brewing Company beer. Salvation is simply another fine beer in its roster. This bottle is approaching three years old and it's held up very well. I don't have any experience with a fresh one to compare it to. Personally, I think it has a tad too much of a tangy dark fruit presence, but that's about the only complaint I have. Pretty impressive stuff all-around."
"After some time in the cellar, this is drinking so smooth. Alcohol is imperceptible, mouthfeel is silky, flavors are well integrated. Loads of caramel and cocoa dominate, a hint of dark fruits in there, roast, coffee, toffee, a light spiciness. A pleasing bitterness and dryness still in the finish, not dominating but enough to tweak the sweetness of this brew - perhaps if anything I would go a little dryer/bitter to counter the sweetness. Thought the mouthfeel could also be a little more robust but in all honesty these are minor quibbles - this was one of the smoothest brews I've had in a while; simply top notch."
"An excellent beer, with only a minor flaw (appearance). Its impressiveness may well be due to aging, but all the elements are there for a fantastic drink, and I fully expect this would taste great fresh as well."
"d - A pretty nice Belgian dark ale. Lots going on and nice balance in the smell, would definitely try again."
"Dark brown pour, bananas, figs, brown sugar and prunes are the first things in the nose, perhaps some caramel and toffee. Definitely some coffee also. Taste is similar, not particularly crazy about this one. Mouthfeel is creamy but not exceptional. Just seemed a bit bland, which made an impact on the drinkability. Probably one of my least favorite RRs."
"D- Very good and super easy to drink."
"D - I'm downing this 750ml bottle on my own, and it seems to be about right. Taking it slow thru dinner and into after dinner watching some baseball on tv. Definitely not one to slug down, but a fine companion for the evening. Alcohol is on the high side at 9%, but it works nicely here...a light warmth, some flavor character and deserving of a bit of respect. This should take me thru the rest of the night. Defintely glad to be able to try this one. Another fine Russian River brew."
"D: A solid representation of the style with a sweet chocolate and molasses character that I don't get out of most others. Great complexity and body here also. A beer well worth seeking out and another example of how Russian River just can't seem to go wrong."
"It should be noted that this beer went directly from my ""cellar"" (read closet) into my glass. Drink this beer too cold and I think you'll miss out on a lot of the malt complexities."
"D: One of the better Belgian styles from Russian River, but the alcohol presence in the flavor was a bit of a downer for me. Still a nice beer, however."
"While Russian River's IPAs are superior on-tap, their house yeast strain seems to deliver more when given a chance to work its magic in a bottle...I've enjoyed all their Belgian style offerings much more in this modality (bottle-conditioned) rather than from a keg."
"The downfall of this beer was a moderate to strong alcoholic nature that was overpowering some flavours. Took away from the feel and drinkability. Hopefully this would mellow with age."
"Drinkability - Quite drinkable."
"Despite the odd smell, I love this beer! This is an exciting time of year!"
"This beer has a medium mouthfeel and body to it. Its completely sweet and has a slight alcoholic flavor to it. Lots of syrupy malt flavors in the front of the mouth and there is a yeasty funk to the whole thing. Overall, its hard to believe that Consecration could come from this thing but its possible. The side-by-side with Consecration was a no-brainer. It was a great exercise but I don't think I'll do it again. Salvation, as a Belgian strong dark, was a good beer, but not my favorite."
"Perfect level of carbonation and a great medium-full bodied brew. Incredibly drinkable for its ABV. I liked this substantially more than when I have had this in the past and look forward to trying it again and pairing it with a hearty dinner. Another winner from RR."
"Very drinkable, rich, yet tart, with a touch of horse blanket funk. HIghly recommended, and something i would love to drink again."
"-not a fan...would definitely not order it there again, especially with all the other great stuff they have to offer"
"an amazing dark ale - another hit from Russian river"
"Easy enough to drink, but fairly strong so one has to be a little careful. I wouldn't want to drink only this beer in a long session. It's got some interesting flavors and aromas, but I would still need a little something more to drink a beer like this all night. Still a good product though. I'd drink it again."
"Overall, a really nice beer. A little too much funk for me, but so smooth and I really like this part of the beer."
"D: Nicely balanced flavors, feel somewhat muted but that enhances this beer. Goes down easily and is a nice beer to really sit with and enjoy."
"Drinkability: The abv is a bit high but nothing else holds this one back from high drinkability."
"Draught at the brewpub during RBSG09. Hazy brown with a thick light beige head. Intense aroma of dried fruit, caramel, and berries. Starts sweet, with some dried fruit , yeastiness, and caramel, and finishes dry and lightly peppery. Medium bodied with medium-high carbonation. Very nice strong dark ale."
"Overall I wasn't sure what to expect with this beer but was pleasantly surprised. While the nose is a bit better and more complex than the flavor this is still a very well made beer and one worth seeking out."
"D: This is a must try for anybody. Despite the higher ABV, this complex beer is easy to drink."
"Sweet, smooth, easy drinker. Enough complexity to keep it interesting, if not the most outstanding of the style."
"D: Quite drinkable, and one of the most drinkable of this style that I've had."
"D-Good and well made brew but not my favorite RR -tion concoction. This one lacks the Wow! factor I am so use to from RR beers."
"Unfortuatly, it's a slow sipper. The flavors are deep and intense, not crisp and sharp. Take your time and enjoy this over an hour. Also make sure it's not ice cold! The pub did a good job at this, so really this is just a warning for those who get bombers."
"A corked 750ml bottle - Batch 006. Poured into my trust Duvel tulip glass. Salvation appears a crystal clear dark chestnut color with a healthy looking two fingers of fluffy ecru colored head. Nose and flavors consist of chocolate, mainly bittersweet, some dark cocoa, a touch of raisin, a good amount of caramel, medium sweetness, prunes. A notch better than medium bodied with decent carbonation for a Belgian Strong. Hard to believe this is 9% as I had no problem emptying the 750. Worth seeking out."
"D - This is Damnation's darker, more evil (and tastier!) twin brother. Huge flavor right off the bat with this one. Really tasty, complex stuff!"
"A great Belgian dark I haven't been disappointed with this brewer yet and looking forward to drinking some more."
"D-very tasty beer. I am not a Belgian beer fan but this was very good. If in the mood for belgian beer, I would have again."
"The taste has lots of rich fruit - raisins, caramelised figs, some plum, and dried fruit, plus general toastiness, a hint of chocolate, and spice, including black pepper and hint of licorice. It is smooth, full-bodied, slightly oily yet also lively and zesty. it is slightly on the sweet side, but complex and very characterful with light spicey bite and a light bitterness to balance things out. It is extremely drinkable and goes well with pizza."
"D - The weird yeasty metallic twang is off-putting enough that I really didn't want so much of this one. Probably my least favorite RR brew, although still not bad in the grand scheme of things."
"D: Pretty highly drinkable, you can't tell it's 9%, the flavor is a little lacking, while still being tasty...I just wish it tasted more intense and complex."
"D - Alcohol flavor well balanced making this a very drinkable beer."
"I drink this beer 3-4 times a week. I have the pleasure of living in Santa Rosa and thank god every time I put my lips on a Russian River Beer. Dark amber, last batch a little cloudy, with caramel and molasses finish. I usually start and finish my sesh with this beer. I cook for a living and would pair salvation with Duck, Pork, Foie Gras, and any poultry."
"Drinkability: Pretty good. I would have another, if there were another to have."
"D - quite good for having the alcohol content. It's pretty sweet but not cloying, it's on the borderline here. But I'd still drink this all day :)"
"03: 2.0"
"D- Good beer, no off flavors that I could tell, but might start to lose interest in this towards the end of the glass."
"Crystal clear and dark, sort of a deep ruby red with slight amber hue. It was topped by a fine cream coloured foam that coated the glass and surface of the beer. Great head retention. Malty aroma, sweet and sugary with notes of dried fruit, sugar coated raisins, faint spice. Quite fruity too, with tart apple and pear appearing as it warmed. Mild bitterness with plenty of sweet molasses and sugary malt flavour. Cherries, caramel, a bit of toffee and chocolate, brown sugar, and a spicy finish. Creamy carbonation, medium to full bodied, mild warmth and a hint of stickiness. Very good with a refined texture and flavour."
"I could have another at the brewery but It wouldn't be my primary choice. I don't plan on purchasing another bottle."
"Mouthfeel is full bodied, with a fluffy lightness from the carbonation. Drinkability is certainly not something to laugh at in a beer this size, but it's not quite world class either."
"clean body, heavily carbonated, which creates a crisp finish that is an asset. The drinkability of this beer strikes me as just about perfect for the style. This beer keeps you interested, 'understated' comes to mind..."
"It is well off the style, but still a very nice, tasty brew. Worthwhile, and better a bit warmer."
"Not quite as lupastic as the on-tap version, but I could drink a few of these. Very, very good beer, & another winner from Russian River."
"Overall: Pretty easy to drink, some alcohol present, and it is pretty sweet. Overall a great example of the style."
"Drinkability: Very enjoyable. Flavorful, dry, and alcoholic. I could sip on this for a while. I'm not too good at rating Belgians, but I like this one quite a bit."
"Pours a light brown with reddish hints. Very minimal head that left slight lacing. The smell was on the sweet side. It consisted of yeast and dark fruity smells. The taste mirrored the smell. There was a nice sweetness. Dark fruits. Raisins. Hint of some malt. The mouth feel was great. It was very smooth and almost syrup like but not in a bad way. The drinkability was good, and I would have loved to have a second glass. Ill be on the look out for an opportunity to try this again."
"Smooth body with creaminess and perfect carbonation. A tasty treat that has aged quite beautifully in my opinion. I will have to seek this one out again and would love to try it on tap someday."
"8/4/8/4/16 (4.0/5)"
"D: Decent. Hurt a bit by the finish. Would certainly have again, but not in the same sitting."
"The beer is pretty light for such a dark color. I expected more carbonation, and I was a little bit disappointed at the smoothness. I like my Belgian Strong Ales with a bit more twang...the beer seemed to lack some character, and as a result, I wouldn't come running back to it, through it was good nonetheless"
"D: I liked this but at 9% it's kinda high to enjoy several of them. Very good though"
"Overall, this was a great beer to start the night off with. I would like to get another and lay it in the cellar for a few years to see how it matures."
"D. Very drinkable. The complexity is amazing. So much going on, so little beer. I wish I had more of these."
"Overall impression: Glad I got a chance to try it. Not exactly what I expected for the style (is this seriously the same style as Rare Vos?), but pretty good."
"D: Very smooth and well-balanced. Hides it's 9% abv very well, making it great drinker."
"Three fingers of rocky tan head quickly climbs to the top of my goblet. It slowly fades and leaves waves of considerable lace. Body is a very deep dark warm brown tone. Nose is crisp with dark fruit, green apple, pepper, clay and rustic malt notes all laced together nicely. Enters the mouth with an initial yeastymalt mix. This quickly yeilds to a dominate slightly soured dark fruit feel that is very well balanced and enjoyable. A consistant sweet-tart like sweetness is all over the palate from start to finish. Very crisp and lively on the tongue. Tartness meets the sweet and malt for a great beer. Mouthfeel is ever so slightly thick but very attractive. Nicely drinkable but the 750ml bottle should be split with someone you love."
"Dark, maybe reddish brown in color. Taste had dark fruits, brown sugar, carmel, figs, lighter in body than I expected. Not my favorite Belgian strong dark, but it's up there. I'd like to see more bottles of this make it out onto the shelves like damnation."
"Pured a robust brown with garnet hues and a slight white head that left a little lace as I drank the ale. Many different smells like candy sugar, raisins, dried fruits, some light malts, etc. The punch of alcohol and sweetness was well rounded out by the matls and soft tartness. I could have drunk this all night if the Brickskeller had another bottle."
"It was an easy beer to drink. I'd drink it again, but wouldn't go out of my way to drink it."
"The color is reddish brown, not super dark. A moderately sized head forms, maybe a couple cms, an off-white color. The head stays around and leaves decent lacing on the glass. The smell is chocolatey sweet primarily, and after the head subsides a little bit you get a bit more of the alcohol scent. A really nice smell. The taste comes immediately as chocolate and ripe fruits, like raisins and such. There's also a decent alcohol burn and some estery tastes. The alcohol does taste kind of funny, but overall the taste is smooth and rich. A great rush of carbonation comes with each sip, and the beer itself is full-bodied, but the bubbles lend themselves to an odd burn. I could probably drink the whole 750 mL in one night, and that would be it. I enjoyed it, and would love to have more, but can't say that it's at the top of my list to get again."
"750 mL bottle poured into a goblet. Dark ruby brown with a beige head that leaves thick lacing. Aroma is sweet with a surprising tartness. Brown sugar, licorice, dark wheat bread, raisin, plum, banana, pudding. Flavor consists of a nice blend between maltiness and esters, accented with an oud bruin tartness and some phenolic spices. Very full flavored and full bodied, with the fine carbonation found in all RR Belgians. Awesome beer, and one that can go head to head with a lot of genuine Belgian strong dark ales."
"Murky brownish red color with a white head that has good retention and lacing. Smell is of dark fruit, clove, and pepper. Taste seems to remind me of Trois Pistole, in that it is a rather spicy Belgian Dark Strong Ale, and I also get the same clove and dark fruits in this. Light bodied with medium carbonation. Very well done, I'd like to give this another try."
"Extremely enjoyable brew. My bottle is from batch 002 which I picked up on my visit to Santa Rosa brewpub two years ago (in 2006). Wonderful sipping beer."
"Probably the most complex Salvation I've tried, but the oxidation takes away some of the fun."
"Pours clear brown with an off-white head. Rich, dense aroma of brown sugar, corainder, clove, and a bunch of sweet malt. The flavors follow through without being heavy-handed or syrupy in the mouthfeel. Malt, caramel, figs, yeast, banana, cinnamon, and even some hops all shine. Very, very, good beer."
"Notes: Russian River does it again. Time and time again I'm blown away by their brews. They live up to the hype, I'll say that."
"Taste & mouthfeel: An even mix of chocolate, dark fruit (figs and banana) and molasses. Heavier on the roast and bitterness than most dark Belgians. Medium-bodied, quite drinkable for the ABV and pleasantly dry in the finish, leaving a lingering note of bittersweet chocolate on the tongue."
"Pours a dark cloudy amber with a thick foamy white head. Aroma is a balnce of maltiness and crisp and dark fruit. Very quaffable well balanced beer. Dark fruit flavor is excellently balanced by a healthy amount of malt."
"D: Since I bought a growler, obviously it must be somewhat drinkable. Or else, I'm just a college student noticing the 9% abv and trying to get a good deal. A friend and I are splitting the growler over a couple of days. Overall, a pretty drinkable belgian."
"Batch 5. Very attractive dark mahogany colored ale, with an authentically Belgian looking head that lasts and laces well. Nose lacks depth and descriptive character. Has some nice elements of dark fruit and toffee, but it lacks intensity and complexity. Batch 5 seems like it's not a great batch."
"Salvation is a good brew, but it lacks that special something to make it great. Try it if you can, but methinks this was a bit overhyped."
"D: not sure if RR makes a beer that is not drinkable, unless it is a bad bottle. very nice, and well worth getting."
"D: Very, they served it in a 1/2 pint tulip but could have easily enjoyed several."
"It is silky smooth - full, yet not thick. Rich, but oh so drinkable. Alcohol is deceptively well-hidden - as much as could be for abv level, IMO. An awesome rich maltiness that is well-balanced. One of the all-time best beers, IMO!"
"Had this on tap two weekends ago at Falling Rock in the aftermath of GABF. Dark brown with lacing that sticks around for a while. Smell and taste of lots of dark fruit, sweetness, spice, and malts. Medium body and carbonation. Highly drinkable. One of my favorite Russian Rivers."
"D - I love Russian River's IPAs but I really didn't expect the quality to translate into their Belgians. I was wrong. This beer stands up well with the true Belgians."
"Pretty drinkable, a little boozy still. Overall, a good brew."
"Pours a brownish color, slightly hazy after a second pour, with ruby orange highlights. Medium tannish head which is somewhat fizzy and good balanced carbonation. Smell is good. Some toasted banana bread and sweetness along with a nice spice. Taste is just great. The sweetness isn't there on the scale I thought it would be. Banana and spice again, with toasted bread and yeast. Caramel and brown sugar interplay nicely and never become too much. A solid mouthfeel with ample carbonation. Light spice and a touch of tartness, it's very smooth with a light tickle on the tongue. This is quite easy going down as well. I enjoyed the limited sweetness of this beer and how it worked with the rest of the components. Reminds me somehow of a bigger Brown Ale with a Belgian influence."
"Pours a hazy brownish orange, very thick off white head forms, tons of lacing, settles to a solid ring, this looks good. Smell is neat, dark fruit, caramel, toast, a bit yeasty, some citrus and floral, chocolate, touch of roast, quite nice. Taste is sweet, very fruity, cherries, chocolate, raisins, yeasty bread, quite rich flavour, but a little sweet I found. Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied with low to medium carbonation. Nice beer, but I found it a bit cloying almost and heavy due to the carbonation being low. Maybe it will be higher in the bottle, but still a nice beer."
"Great balance and clean mineral taste that is something I find unique in this brew. Drank from a pint, was on the road so no tulip which would of helped. Some dry herbs, almost fig / blueberry type flavors also. Didn't get banana like others, some spice and anise and vanilla. Very interesting and a great and memorable brew."
"I really enjoyed drinking this beer and would recommend that you try it if you can get your hands on it."
"Based on the nose, I think I was expecting this one to be slightly sweeter and fruitier, as I sometimes prefer in this style. This one, however, achieves a very nicely constructed balance of mild fruit and grains with a distinctly Russian River yeast binding. A very pleasant ale that's easy to drink and seems to grow assertively in character with each sip."
"Drinkability, like this beer, is just great. I really love this beer, but it's an obtuse take on the style, a very hybridized strong dark. I normally grade more within style, but this is too enjoyable to be a stickler - killer! Not that it's a score factor, but this glass is lame, and after just picking up the fat Lost Abbey glass, I'll probably not even bother using this for my next standard issue RR...still, I wish I didn't just get a 2nd bottle from the brewery, but they say this one should be available around here soon - in which case it will be a cellar staple!"
"Decent feel and drink. Rather light bodied for the style"
"I am a fan of this beer. I just can't get enough"
"Overall a great beer and I would definitely get it again."
"Edit: I tried this beer on tap at RR (10/19/08) and liked it even more, so I've raised the scores somewhat. This is an absolutely delicious beer with some of the best coloring that I've ever seen. It's brown with golden highlights at the edges. The flavor is complex, and it succeeds marvelously as a BSD. Wonderful."
"...poured at the Stone Brewery."
"D: An OK beer from Russian River, not one of their best IMO, but I'm glad I finally found it to try it, all right drinkable dark ale."
"D_Another winner from RR. The alcohol is really the only thing I find off here but they could ave been going for that. Well worth seeking out."
"Drinkability is fairly high. Nice flavors and the alcohol is hidden very well. Really enjoyable."
"nice, heavy black licorice at first, good flavor, I wish we got this and perdition in addition to the beers they currently distribute to Colorado."
"D - Very good. Going to be hard to limit as this tastes better than most session beers."
"4.75/4.25/4.25/4.25/4.25"
"Recommended. A very solid BSDA from Russian River."
"D: It's been ages since I've had a non-Hop Bomb or Barrel-aged Sour from RR and I like the change of pace. This is the kind of beer that you sit and nurse for several hours, enjoying each sip."
"Thank god for Vinnie..."
"D - Overall, an okay beer from RR. It was my first experience with them and have to say I felt a bit disappointed. The falvor was good but the carbonation mixed with the taste was just a bit too much for me. I really had to think hard about whether I wanted to have the rest of the bomber or not. Still want to have some other beers by this brewery just not this one."
"M/D: Goes down really well and is very drinkable considering the alcohol level. Has some carbonation in there do to the bottle fermentation and be careful for the yeast cake at the bottom of the bottle it comes out quite easily."
"Really tight cork, could not twist it off, I needed to use my wine opener! Pours really nice and the spicey aroma made my nose happy and I knew I'm in for a treat. The flavor is huge, malty and just enough dark fruit. It's a very complex beer and I'm not sure I can label all that I'm tasting but it really lasts for a long time. If this had good availability in my area, I think it would enter my regular rotation! Great beer."
"Pours a dark ruby brown with a nice espresso like frothy head. Smell is wonderful dark fruits and some belgian yeast. Taste is more, plump, juicy dark fruits. The label dictates banana, but I'm getting some juicy plums, grapes, and possibly even blackberries. This is a real gem. Creamy with the perfect amount of carbonation. This is a winner."
"D- This would be a five except for the alcohol in the equation. I could have a few glasses of this (and I will!) but the alcohol catches up quickly. Another great one from Russian River!"
"This is a keeper, without a doubt. Will definitely seek this out whenever the opportunity presents itself."
"Ah timing is everything. Stopped by RR Brewing on my way home from San Francisco and there was Salvation. While I waited for them to fill my Growler with Pliny the Younger I pleasured my way through a glass of this sublime brew. In the glass it sat a beautiful ruby that was so dark is looked almost brown, and had a small but attractive head and good lacing. Nose was of ripe fruit and flowers, Rich mouthfeel. Flavors are ripe fruit with raisins and plums, and some spices hanging in there at the finish. Delectable brew."
"Overall: Another great beer from Russian River. I would drink this beer again in a heartbeat."
"It's rich and enticing, involving you in each sip - but not so overly complex that you can't just enjoy it straight out. It's more of a sipper that you can enjoy slowly after a good meal. And I'd imagine it might be a good cigar beer, although I'm not sure. Highly recommended!"
"d: I'll probably never get a chance to try batch #3 again, but I'd certainly love the chance to try later batches to compare and contrast with this one. An outstanding offering from Russian River."
"D: A good ale, certainly not the best that Russian River makes but worth a try."
"Been wanting to try this for some time, I was curious to see how Russian River did with darker ales, this exceeded all my expectations, highly recommended, cannot wait to drink this again some time, it is supposedly becoming a year round brew like Damnation, amazing beer"
"This beer is very impressive and I must say I quite liked it. I would always order this beer any time I see it; it competes quite favorably with some of the Belgium strong dark ales I've had. Very solid and highly recommended."
"I'm not sure if I caught Salvation too early or too late. This bottle is about 18 months old and the brewery says that it can go 4 years at least. Alternatively, maybe it was never destined to be one of Russian River's masterpieces."
"Overall- Enjoyable. Probably won't drink again, but definitely worth it."
"delicious brew."
"The body was medium/heavy which is what I would expect from a RR brew. There was some fizziness to it and some bite from the alcohol. Again, I think I would like to try it a few degrees cooler becuase that may squelch some of the alcohol presence. Other than that its a very drinkable beer."
"Overall: A very nice American style Dubble. The yeast goes great with the dark malts and the mouthfeel really caps off another amazing beer from Mr. Cilurzo and the Russian River Crew!"
"Pours a clear dark ruby brown with a tan head. Massive lacing. Nose is slightly sweet with a touch of yeast influence. Also heavy amounts of caramel as well. Flavor is tart and tangy. There is a pungent sweet flavor mixed with a slight citric/fruity one. Caramel tones very present. On the end you get an almost bitter edge which seems odd to me off this style. Feel is decent. Not a ton of carbonation and bubble over your tongue, but it is thick with character from ingredients. It is drinkable, yes. In a blind taste test, I doubt anyone would be able to tell that this one came from the U.S. (and not Belgium). However, I feel as if it lacks a level of maturity and oomph that would ever send me back to drinking it again. In the back of my mind, I do wonder if it needed some more age on it."
"Batch #004. Poured from a 750 ml bottle into my DT snifter. It was a dark rich mahogany color. It had a small light tan head that quickly settled into a thin collar. The aroma was sweet with fruit and a spicy undertone. Could also sense a bit of the alcohol. Unlike most BSDA's that I've had this year, this one didn't have an over-reliance on dark fruit (raisins mainly) and alcohol. Most BSDA aromas bug me with those but this one was very enjoyable. The same went for the taste. It had a much richer flavor for me than the others which I found too raisiny and hot. It has a sweet taste that stays well short of cloying. The aftertaste builds on the sweetness in a good way. Gotta say this is one of maybe 2 BSDA's that I'd look forward to drinking again right now. Highly recommend. It's not available here or it'd be a several time a year player. For now, I'll have to rely on my best friend's brother to ship us some a couple times a year. (Reg rotation (if was avail))"
"D: Easier as I go."
"I drank this one on my 40th birthday amongst great beers such as unibroue 2005, Deus and other big Belgians. I noticed the complexity and drinkability of this beer stood out for me. Vinnie has the ability to create beers that have many levels and yet nail the styles attempted .I loved the dark fruit notes and the endless finish on this brew. A true American classic."
"Bottle picked up at City Beer Store in San Francisco. Pours coca-cola colored, brown to red. Thin but resiliant tan head. Quick lacing. Smells of bananas and other fermenting fruit. Taste is overly alcohol laced, at least at first. Aggressive fruitiness and heavy spice comes through to balance out the ethanol punch. Flavor settles nicely after a while and becomes a nice complex Belgian. creamy and puffy mouthfeel. full bodied. Overall, too much for me, especially for the first glass or so. Flavor is slightly muddled and too much of an obvious alcohol presence. My least favorite of the Russian Rivers i've tried. Maybe im just more of a fan of the wild ales."
"Drinkability: a real slow sipping beer that will last you through the evening. Flavor profile seems to get more intense as it warms. Everyone should give this complex brew a try."
"Yet another great beer from a brewery that can apparently do no wrong."
"batch 003. pours a hazy ambery/brown/mahogany with a big tan head that leaves some serious lacing. i could smell it while i was pouring, but the nose ended up being not as strong as i expected. still good though. sweet bread, figs, raisins, and a bit musty. similar to rochefort 8, or all the other incredible beers in this category. taste reveals a few more fruit flavors like a hint of banana, some spice, and alcohol that seems dry at first, but doesn't burn going down. it kind of floats around and hits my olfactory station while the rest goes down to my belly. that was interesting. hops also come through ever so subtly, like they'e just there to enjoy the brew like me. on the heavy side of medium body and ever so drinkable and enjoyable, this brew has some serious serious competition. if i had never tried a ton of other brews in this style that are simply gifts from the heavens, i would have thought this brew was the best thing ever. i still think that the RR crew is super talented, and that this beer is also a gift from God. I believe it is a must try and a company that all of us BA's should be proud of. thanks RR, keep 'em coming!"
"Beer poured into my Duvel tulip glass with a nice tan head emerging initially. Nose is of Belgian yeast, banana, and other fruits. Taste is awesome! A complex medley of chocolate, pepper, banana, raison, rum alcohol, spices, and the classic abbey dry finish - amazing! Mouthfeel is very smooth across the palate and is medium bodied. Drinkability is very good. The alcohol is not prevelant in the taste but warms as it goes down. Excellent beer that must be tried if you have an opportunity!"
"Poured into a chalice a nice clean/clear mahongany color, very nice carbonation, awesome two-finger plus creamy tan head, lots and lots of creamy sticky lacing throughout the drink. The nose is malty, nice touch of yeast, figs, raisins, plums, and a nice touch of caramel. The taste is also awesome, malty, sweet/tangy, got the RR touch of yeast they are know for, dark fruits/caramel. The alcohol is hidden very well, you would never know this was a 9% ABV brew. Medium body, well-rounded, complex brew. Very drinkable, MAN! this brewery knows how to brew awesome beers. Highly recommended."
"Aroma is rich and tart. Taste follows starts with hearty dark maltiness, coupled with potent spicing, goes a bit tart in the middle, and then fades away with alcohol notes. Mouthfeel is incredibly smooth and drinkability is top-notch. Another exciting -tion brew from RR."
"So good."
"Overall a pleasant Belgian Style Golden Ale."
"A great and characterful beer."
"Drinkability: Truly extraordinary; why this isn't in the Top 100 is beyond me"
"Drinkability is great. This is a very nice Belgian Dark Ale, a great example of the style. Russian River hits it out of the park again... what else is new?"
"This is a must try if you can get it. I love this beer."
"The abv limits this to one bottle in a session, it's easily enjoyed though. It's good, but not as unique as RR's barrel-aged offerings. Still leaps and bounds over any other American BSDA."
"Dear God, is this beer a sight... Nearly opaque and topped with one of the most lovely heads I've ever seen. Tightly bubbled, its sits up proud then slowly likes to fall, but its former self clings tightly to the side of the glass. With nose to glass, I get caramel and bread, with nuts and spice. If this nose is any indication, this would be insane with some rich bread pudding. Down the hatch.... Man is it tasty! Caramel, like the nose suggests, along with raisins and a bit of rum. Alcohol is evident in the finish and it warms the whole chest. There is a medium finish with the snappy hops rolling across the tongue. Nothing short of astonishing. Mouthfeel is creamy, with a slick lovely texture. Carbonation is spot on. This beer is dangerous. At 9%, its insane how easy this bastard is to drink. Almost perfect... Kudos to Russian River. And to think, the brewer behind Pliny also makes this dream beer. Amazing!"
"Drink - Very drinkable. I wish I could buy it in New Mexico"
"Flavor is not in comparison with the aroma. Heavy malt base followed up by a Belgian sugar sweetness. Then a coating spiciness matched with a slight buring from the alcohol heat. Little bits of fruits too such as cheerry, prunes and pineapple. Medium body that fills out a bit as it warms. But I like this beer a bit colder and lighter. Excellent drinking for an afternoon where you are looking for something more than a session beer."
"Drinkability - A good American BSDA."
"The mouthfeel is thick and creamy. Very smooth. The alcohol is nowhere to be found, as opposed to the Avery, which was damn near brutal with the burn at the same 9% ABV. Very drinkable for such a strong beer. Definitely the stronger of the two, but again, I love them both."
"750 ml, batch 001. This batch is even more delicious after some aging. Pours a murky copper brown with a moderately large fine grained head that retains very well and leaves some sloppy lacing. Beautiful aromas coming out of the chalice, including plums, sweet and sour fruit, some cinnamony esters, and a pronounced sourness reminiscent of a flanders red- this scent does not come through in the flavor. The flavor itself is wonderful, however. Very creamy, with a taste as of plum and cherries marinated in balsamic vinegar, water, and honey. Rich darker fruit follows with some immediate bitterness and then a long creamy sweet finish that is divine. Really a work of art and a little more fully integrated and creamy after some extra time in the bottle. The sourness seems a little more interesting as well. The mouthfeelis phenomenal- light and airy, it seems to float on the palate, and with a wonderful creaminess. Tremendously drinkable, the abv seems to just not be a factor."
"Pours a deep, dirty orange colour into a sample glass. Little bit of head, and some lacing. Sour apple or pear aroma. Muted but very interesting flavour: sour cherry and pomegranate, maybe? Smooth mouthfeel and pleasant, lingering sour cherry aftertaste make this very drinkable. Nice!"
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, sugary, creamy, and smooth."
"Thanks for the sample Sammy!"
"drinkability is great. very deep and interesting beer. my favourite of the night. really good and a beer i look forward to trying again."
"Verdict: a damn good strong dark. A lot of layers, and a wide variety of fruity flavors. One of the better offerings of the style, especially for being brewed in the U.S., but not quite the tip of the iceberg."
"Definitely a sipping beer, and definitely a pleasant pairing with a book on a cold, windy night. Much, much better as it warms, so mind the suggested serving temperatures."
"Batch 002. Faint wisp of salty malt aroma. Nice clean amber pour, shrouded with off-white rim. Flavor is a quite sour malty flavor, with some cherry. thai lemongrass and galangal, but its not particularly nuanced or distinctive. Composed with some long caramels and a bit of sour oat saltiness. Ebbs lemon tangy on the backend and this joins some bland grape skins. Bite of almond. Not cloying. Yeast begins to dominate. Crisp lemon leaf hop finish. I was looking for more. Thanks Andy!"
"Appeared a medium-dark brown with a frothy tan colored head. Plenty of bubbles glued to the surface. Some lacing was apparent in my cup. Aromas of plums, raisins, and toast. The taste followed suit with sweet fruity flavors dominating. A hint of smoke and cream also came out. Quite flavorful and enjoyable. The alcohol is detectable but it blends right in. I would very much like to have this one again."

"Somehow, the flavor contradicts what I was expecting from the aroma. This beer is tart leaning to sour, but not cloying or offensive. I've definately tasted better in this style (Begium brewed mostly), but for an American brewer I think they are getting closer to getting the style right. Now if I could get my hands on some Pliny...."
"split courtesy of dirtylou while in Madison...batch 001"
"drinkability: good"
"Cheers!"
"Drinkability: Very drinkable. I could drink a 750ml bottle without any trouble. It would be great with a nice dinner. Would definately purchase this one."
"A year later bottle just as good, more yeast in aroma and taste. Thanks Crushinat0r for that one."
"D - A very drinkable and tasty beer."
"Flavor...wow not so nice as Borat might say if hed had this. Its got a lot of tart and spicy notes with some hot alcohol and a lot of peppery zing, but the fruity notes from the aroma are gone daddy gone. Aggresive yeast? I dont care. I paid money for this and unlike most RR beers this is very blaaah. Little flavor concnetration and little range."
"D- This beer is very smooth and subtle. I liked the flavor but they were very hidden and it would be nice if they came through even more or had a big flavor or two to anchor the beer. The flavors were very well blended and it was hard to pull out a lot of the flavors."
"Mouth: Chocolate immediately upon entering the mouth - dry cocoa powder. Then malty flavors of maple syrup. An amazing mouthfeel that carries the flavors from front to back on a wave of bustling carbonation. Hops are light but noticeable and enjoyable as a dull green bitterness that shows its face directly preceding the swallow. Roasted malts break through in the finish and last with a dark sour cherry flavor and burnt toast. Alcohol flavor present and warming, not unpleasant, even as the brew warms."
"Clear cordovan with fiery ruby highlights. Tall small and medium bubbled khaki head topped with crema fine bubbles. Possess a core of steady, but paced, small bubbled carbonation streams. The head slowly settles to a short collar and a thin skim, leaving draped veils of lace. Aromas of cloves, bananas, spiced prunes and only the faintest whiff of yeast. The aroma is much brighter and cleaner than batch 001. Strong clove flavors are complimented by a lush, slick sweet yeastiness. Some banana tones are present, and the finish is much warmer and wet than batch 001, and is also a touch sticky. Longish finish punctuated by clove oil, pepper, and dark fruits. Medium-full body and fine carbonation, this felt bigger than 001. Superbly drinkable now, but will evolve and dry out with some time."
"D: This beer was much too young. 18 months would do this one some good. The sugars would chill forming a quality caramely flavor."
"D: Strange beer, sweet but not too sweet not hoppy either. Pretty complex flavor, really grew on me toward the end of my bottle. Thanks to GClarkage for this bottle"
"Dark brown color, reasonably clear with dark ruby highlights. The beer formed a nice head that showed good retention, but there is no lace left on the side of the glass as it recedes. Nice full nose. Tons of yeasty bread, dark berry fruit in the from of black cherry and black berry tumbles from the glass. Figs, dates, all of the dark caramel essence you would expect from a fine Belgian style ale. The flavor reflects the aroma quite well. The dark berry character comes up front. The black cherry is very prominent. Nice fig element mid drink with just a touch of orange citrus on the finish. Spice comes through late in the finish, just a little nutmeg character. Nice smooth, and full mouth feel. No alcohol heat (surprising at this strength. Really wonderful beer."
"Drinkability & Notes  The smooth flavor, and a lack of higher alcohols makes this an easy drinker compared to other big Belgians. However overall I'll just call it solid, that is to say one of the weaker offerings that I have had from RR. I am happy I got to give it a try, and with the way Vinnie seems to keep tinkering with his recipes, I'm sure I'll give it a try a few batches down the road."
"Notes: While I find this brewery to be outstanding this is not one of their better offerings. This was purchased online and the packaging was excellent with all 6 750ml bottles in perfect condition. Thanks Vinnie, I'll order from you again very soon, just not this product for the price."
"Mouthfeel I'd rated as good, but my notes are murky here. Drinkability isn't rated high though, between the rich flavors, the sourness, and the alcohol, one of these is all I want at a time."
"Color of dark brown - thick tan head - nose yeast , wood notes , malts , some pine hops , tobacco , sour cherries and sour / bitter chocolate - taste is sour red fruit , tobacco , grass , sour yeast , and malt - champagne with sour body  aftertaste chocolate cherries"
"Mouthfeel is medium, well carbonated and very drinkable. Much lighter than expected, lighter than most other Belgian ales of the same style, which makes it much prefereable. A great American version, actually better than some Belgians I've had, one I would drink again."
"Thanks for the nice brew Darren!! Appreciate it!!"
"Elements of Unibroue La Terrible (the good elements) and 2004 in this impressively complex-yet-mellow Strong Dark Ale. Glad I had the chance to try it and can't wait to try more from RR in the future."
"A solid beer, lighter in most aspects than many others in the style and more about subtlety than in your face bold complexity."
"Drinkability: The complexity of flavors and the alcohol in the finish would keep me to 2 or 3, but the fruity flavors and nicely rendered malts definitely make this a drinkable beer. One to check out for the complex combination of flavors and the nice balancing act that makes this drinkable."
"I probably will not order this one online again, like I would the Damnation. If this were on-tap near me, I would probably give it another go."
"I thought this was pretty drinkable and worth recommending."
"a decent beer but not one of the standout examples of awesomeness that RR is known for. an ok example of a belgian dark."
"I'm glad I gave this beer another chance. It's not perfect, but it does present some enjoyable flavors while still giving me a substantial buzz to let me know who's boss. I think I'll let at least one of the last two age for six months or so and then give it another run to see how it matures; I have a feeling it will treat me even better next time."
"Drinkability- I really enjoyed this brew. Not up to the benchmark Belgian ones, but for an American made one of this style, I give two thumbs up. Gee, another good beer from RR....what a suprise."
"Mouthfeel and drinkablity are also nice. Very good stuff from one of the best breweries on the planet."
"Bottle (Courtesy of Jimbowood): Poured a dark brown color ale with a huge foamy head with great retention. Aroma of spices with strong malt presence and funky yeast. Taste is at first dominated by some spices with some semi-sweet dry fruits. There is also some subtle sourness, which doesnt dominate but is very enjoyable. Body is above average and alcohol is well hidden. Another winner from this great brewery who in my mind is probably currently doing the best Belgian in North America."
"Flavor ir rich, malty, roasty, with dark fruits (cherries, figs, dates), cinnamon, generally pleasant. But unfortunately, it ends with a very strong alcohol burn- much too strong. Not as bad as a few others I could name, but it's up there. This just brings the beer down in my mind, quickly lowering the overall enjoyment, and it kills drinkability. Too bad too, because the rest of the beer is quite nice!"
"This beer pours a deep red with a big off white head that holds well and laces fantastically. This beer smells up front with the beligan yeast along with some fruity esters. Some aromas may include apples, bannanas, and plums. The beer also exhibits a strong taste of yeast but more flavors open up through the taste including some spiciness and sourness. The mouthfeel is decently thick with serious amount of dryness. Overall a very good belgian with still some room for improvement."
"The dry finish ruins this one a little for me. It's a very interesting drink with tons of flavor. The sour flavors threw me off a little. I'll pick this up again if I find it in a store or have it a little more readily available. I don't know that I'll order online again."
"Bottom line: Yet another winner from Russian River that does not fail to please my palate. I recommend it!"
"Another delicious beer from Russian River. It is wild and funky without descending into flavor anarchy."
"This bottle was part of my stash I had shipped from RR to a relative in Minnesota and then my wife brought it back in her luggage from Mn along with 11 other RR bottles. The things you have to do to get great beer when living in Pa. Batch 001. This beer poured a brilliant dark amber color with a slight tan head. The aroma is a bit malty, caramelly and with a touch of fruit, maybe raisins. You also get a bit of the abv in there. Very pleasing to my sniffer. The taste is big. There is a great malt backbone with more raisins and figs. I also got some toasted notes, a bit of chocolate. The body is medium and makes for a pretty drinkable beer, even with an abv of 9%. Another fine beer from RR."
"a nice beer, that drinks on the light side. a good afternoon sipper, but not on the knock your socks off leval, of say Gulden Draak or Trios Pistoles imo, but this beer is different ground so that is ok. well worth a try, (order it from the website if you can't find it), but don't lose any sleep over this one if you can't find it...love you russian river.!"
"From my notes on recent trip, poured into a sampling glass, arrived a dark amber bordering on brown, with a fair head and lacing down the glass. Aroma is caramel malts and ripened fruits, like raisins. Quite nice. Taste is likewise with dark fruits of figs and raisins and such, with slight chocolate and coffee notes, i love these malts. Mouth is good, medium with ok carbonation. A very drinkable beer in my book."
"750ml bottle from Batch 001. Deep dark amber brown colored body with a nice foamy light tan head. Some light lacing was left on the glass. Aroma of ripe fruits with caramel is strong. Some light spices and yeast notes round it out. Taste starts off a bit sugary with some more sweetness from some figs and raisons. Light spiciness cuts through the sweetness. Mild roasted notes towards the end where it finishes up with more fruits. Solid body thats well carbonated and carries the flavor well. An easy drinker for the strength. Another solid offering from Russian River."
"Russian River suggests, All in all, this beer could use some bottle age to mellow out. I think this is quite delicious right now, but I do have one saved cellaring. Russian River never lead me wrong before."
"This is quite a good beer, but I think that it will improve quite a bit with some age, it should soften up and mellow a bit with at least 6 months or perhaps even a couple of years of age. As the beer warms up it becomes a bit drier and the chocolate and toasted malt notes become a bit more prominent. It also becomes a bit softer and rounder, and just a bit more easy to drink. All in all a very interesting, characterful, complex brew. I certainly think this will age quite well for many years."
"Overall: Reminded me of Alesmith Decadence in some respects, not so much flavorwise, but in the fact that it needs some warmth and probably a little aging, but not much, maybe just 6 months, to really improve this one. It may be suitable for 4 years, but I will be back in the Summer to revisit this one!"
"though i've never demanded excitement from my beers, this one was not overly complex. my least favorite of RR's offerings so far"
"Dark ruddy orange/brown with a nice head of light brown/tan foam that leaves some nice lacing patterns. Aromas are all malty sweetness, dark candi sugar, toffee, and more. The taste is malty sweet, bready, and full of caramel notions, but the hops that are in this brew are really muted and subtle. The mouthfeel is thick and almost cloying, and the drinkability is pretty damn good as well. Not my favorite RR beer at all, but still very nice, and very good for this often dissapointingly made in the US style."
"Drinkability  This one is closing on 10% ABV and it is smooth as smooth can be. What a great beer!"
"Tap@Russian River Brewpub. Heavy sweetness, lots of figgy caramel flavours, with some late acidity to balance it out, bit too sweet though. Some sweet vanilla and pear also noticed, but not quite my cup of tea in the end, will definitely try again one day though."
"Sampled on tap at Father's Office in Santa Monica. This brew poured a deep amber with a massive rocky tannish head which was mostly gone within a few short minutes. Certainly banana & spice in the aroma as advertised. Also some background hints of caramel malty sweetness & really ripe peach. Moderate quantity of caramel malt provides a foundation for the yeastiness to shine. Deep & dark fruit flavors seem to come & go as a subtle bitterness & almost clove-like spiciness make brief appearances. Ripe banana and sweetened raisins in the finish. Full bodied & wickedly dry, this is a very nice brew."
"The taste is primarily of a fruit and berry mixture. Not like a fruit or berry beer, mind you, but like a well-done belgian ale with good layers of flavor. The grains are somewhat apparent in the finish. The alcohol content is evident in the smell but not the taste."
"Compared to other Belgians my ranking of this one must appear pretty high. This 9% monster poured a nice copper color, off white head lasted long and left decent lace patterns. Aroma was of some banana and of course yeast. While taste profile was on the smooth side, there was noticible alcohol. Banana was on the mellow side and some bready yeast was detectable. A well made brew that once again just does not do it for me. I wish it did."
