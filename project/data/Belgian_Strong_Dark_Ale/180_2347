4.5,16.3,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Dried fruit aromas, dark pitted fruits, spice, dark sugars and a suspicion of fruitcake, traces of alcohol and some earthiness on the nose. Pours brilliant chestnut under a 1” white foam cap that slowly dissipates to a thin whisp of a head that never the less produces lace. Also has some legs. Fruit cake components start the palate with fig to dates, a hint of toffee, prune, dark cake, a little spice (coriander and anise) alcohol and an earthy hop finish. There is also some warming but the alcohol is not solventy or hot. It is surprisingly light for all it has going on and the alcohol levels – medium to medium high on the body and medium carbonation. A big beer with the presence of a port or a bourbon.","pat61","Mar 16, 2015"

4.22,9,4,4.5,4,4,4.5,"750 ml bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 5/6/2013. Pours light hazy deep ruby red color with a 2 finger light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big raisin, plum, fig, pear, apple, apricot, banana, caramel, brown sugar, toast, bread, clove, herbal, light nuttiness, and yeast earthiness. Fantastic aromas with great complexity of fruity/earthy yeast and dark/bready malt notes; with great strength. Taste of big raisin, plum, fig, pear, apple, apricot, banana, caramel, toast, brown sugar, bread, clove, herbal, light nuttiness, and yeast earthiness. Fair amount of earthy yeast spice on the finish; with lingering notes of raisin, plum, fig, pear, apple, apricot, banana, caramel, brown sugar, toast, bread, clove, herbal, light nuttiness, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a while. Damn nice complexity and robustness of fruity/earthy yeast and dark/bready malt sweetness; with a great malt/yeast flavor balance and zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a smooth and fairly slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is an awesome Belgian strong dark ale. All around great complexity and balance of fruity/earthy yeast and dark/bready malt sweetness; and very smooth to sip on for the big ABV. A highly enjoyable offering.","superspak","Jun 09, 2014"

The taste is pleasant with notes of spice against an alcohol base. It finishes with a note of spice and alcohol. The alcohol leaves that nice pleasant burn.

Nice smell. Head won't dissipate! Waiting...waiting...*Final Jeopardy tune ensues*...waiting. OK. Let's do this. Taste is leathery and doesn't really follow the tart aroma. Sort of bland and a lot less flavor than expected. Bit of fruit. Slight booze and breadiness. I just haven't been impressed with the Delirium line. Expensive, bland, and an ugly bottle to boot.

Smell is somewhere between a strong Belgian ale and a hint of sour. Taste is more Belgian ale up front but then fruit - fig, plum, prune - and Christmas spices take over on the back end. This beer should be drank on the colder side - too much sitting brought out less desirable flavors.","Oakenator","Jan 04, 2013"

4,3.4,4,4,4,4,4,"Enjoyed this one while jazz club hopping in New Orleans! Served from tap into a Chimay goblet. Poured red-brown with a half finger off-white head that subsided to a minimal amount quickly. Maintained nice lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, bread, spice, fruit, dark fruit, and subtle sweet alcohol. The flavor was of sweet malt, fruit, banana, spice, grain, earth, dark fruit, and subtle sweet alcohol. It had a light feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a good brew. I really like the aspect of the sweet alcohol taking place here to let you know that even though this brew has pink elephants on it, it still has a set of balls! There was also a very nice spice aspect going on in the flavor which kept your palate interested in what you would find next in it. Really glad I got the chance to try this one on tap and was really surprised I found this at a jazz bar of all places. Definitely worth trying if you get the opportunity.","thagr81us","Dec 31, 2012"

4,3.4,4,4,4,4,4,"I was able to try a glass (tulip) of Delirium Noel at the Kendall Pub in Yorkville, IL. The beer has a nice deep amber color with a decent off white creamy one finger head. Their is a nice lacing around the top of the glass and it is well carbonated. The smell comes off malty, a sweet fruity smell (almost dried fruit) and a hint of carmel to it. The taste has a lot going on with just a great blend of sweetness, carmel, fruity, and a nice malty finish..it just comes together well. The mouthfeel is decent as it lingers with some bitterness from the malts and almost a little piney taste that hangs around. Overall, this is a decent beer and im curious of buying a bomber and keeping it cellared for a couple of years to see if it gets more complex. A decent xmas beer.","WoodBrew","Dec 22, 2011"
3.65,-5.7,3.5,3.5,4,3,3.5,"The smell is a strong malt-forward fruitiness with light phenols and a touch of a vinegar-like astringency. The taste is nice, primarily that malt fruitiness and some spices. I have a hard time with such a gassy beer. I think they need to drop some of that carbonation.

The top was also covered with tin foil glued on so it was a bit of a task to open the darn thing. Eventually it poured an attractive dark amber sort of like mahogany with a short-lived head that leaves little in the way of lacing. This is most definitely an aromatic beer with a variety of sweet malts, apple, yeast, and some alcohol in the character. The body runs in the medium range. The taste starts out with sweet, oily malts followed by a notable, dry hop afterbite. The 10% ABV comes on strong and I feel it pretty quickly but that is what Belgian Strong Ales are supposed to do.

Taste mirrors the nose, though the hops are a bit more floral on the tastebuds, a bit of light spice presence, cinnamon.

Aroma smells surprisingly like a hefe. I'm getting banana and clove up front. I also smell some vanilla. Smells inviting. Drinks just like the smell. Banana and clove dominate. I'm also getting hints of some dark fruits: maybe plums or raisins. Mouthfeel is unexpectedly thin and watery. The alcohol is very well hidden. Overall, pretty tasty. This is a relatively sweet brew, but not cloying. I would have liked to see a fuller body and some more complexity.

I noticed differences in the carbonation and the spice between the two, and felt that the bottle presented these aspects in a stronger manner than the draft. Overall I still feel that the beer is muted. I wish it had just a little more ""oomph"" to the spice or to the maltyness. I know I can be a bit of a difficult judge regarding the winter season of beers, but after multiple exposures to this beer, I feel it is just a bit overrated and feel it to be quite average.","Samashley","Dec 23, 2010"

Lots of malt right away in the aroma with kind of a banana bread aroma. Alongside all that is hints of seasonal spices like nutmeg and cloves. Overall the aroma is pretty sweet, but I like sweet things. Again, real sweet and malty with spices associated with the holidays coming through in the pallet. It starts malty with a toffee undertone with a gingerbread kind of flavor. It's actually really enjoyable, but I'm only three sips in. Not quite as heavy as I had imagined this to be, but not much to complain about in the mouthfeel otherwise. Kind of a sipper and I feel like this is a bit on the sweet side.

Sweet malt taste that is quite warming. Dry fruit character is throughout the taste before finishing dry and quite warmng. Low amount of carbonation with a medium feel.

Overall, a pleasant and alluring aroma. The flavor carries much of the same with an added hint of oaky vanilla and rum-soaked fruit. The mouthfeel is nicely carbonated and has good body but the alcohol peaks through a bit more than I'd like. It was a bit hot and could be more balanced in this respect. Generally speaking it's a good beer that I would recommend trying but it could certainly stand some cellaring. I drank this one a month or so after it's release.

Light to medium-bodied with a fast rising carbonation, within a nanosecond starts foaming up towards your mouth roof. Only slightly sweeter here, noticeably dry on the whole. Touch extra caramel, toffee and depth in the orange citrus and pear, apple, fig, apricot fruit.

Translucent, with some carbonation visible; light came through pretty clearly. A nice beer to look at. Taste of phenols, spice, currants, belgian yeast.

Slight burn in the throat but not unpleasant for a winter seasonal. Given time in the beer locker I would imagine this beer developing extremely well. The spices are actually balanced well with the sugar and add a complexity to the beer that a lot of dark Belgians can't claim. The alcohol is a bit much and detracts from drinkability.

The taste is sweetly fruity up front with an earthy, malty, and slightly alcoholic finish. Very soft mouthfeel and pleasingly warming. Despite its high alcohol content (10%) it is not overwhelming.

Fantastic, but very very sweet. Maybe too sweet. Mouthfeel is rather normal, a light effervesense. A little sticky in the finish. This is a nice beer if yoru a fan of the fruit foward flavors. For me its a touch too sweet, some more spice in the palate could cut the sweet nicely. At 10% alcohol though, the alcohol is nicely hidden.

There's little notable about the pour, beyond the deep amber colour, and the thin head. There's apples, cinnamon, and what seems to be a few light, phenolic hints in the odour. In the mouth it's smooth, not at all thin, and with perfect amount of crispness to counter this sweet, malty beer. Little citrus zest, though not much, and it first, I confused it with a more peppery flavour. The alcohol becomes apparent as it warms, but so does the `roasted fruits` of indeterminate origin.

Nice aroma, lots of fruity esters, some malt and spicinesses with minimal amounts of alcohol. Esters are mostly of darker fruits like plums and cherries but there do seem to be some pears lurking beneath the surface. Phenols are peppery, malt is mostly caramel with a touch of bread and alcohol is light with a slightly perfumey character. Taste is reminiscent of the aroma in the all the above aromas are present in the flavor but they are present in different intensities. Malt seems to be much more prevalent here with bready/caramel undertones. Esters are again plums and dark cherries but pears and some other lighter fruits remain. Towards the finish there is a more notable alcohol presence than in the aroma. The alcohol is distinctly rose-like and very pleasant. Esters seem to linger into the finish and are joined by the peppery phenols that were found in the aroma but, until this point, absent from the flavor. Good mouthfeel, medium body with moderate carbonation. Drinkability is quite good.

Quite simply these are simple interpretations of Belgian styles and perhaps very good introductions for people weening opening theeirr eyes to the wider world of beer out there. Pours amber with a good head and decent lacing. Smells lightly grainy, slightly sour, with some sweetness and a touch of banana. The taste is light, herbal, honeyed, spiced and even a bit silky in the mouth, but nothing all that complex going on here. Light and grainy in the mouth.

A real caramel apple smell along with belgian yeast, clove, bubble gum, and spice. Very nice. A lush and creamily carbonated light-medium body has just a little bit of light, dry, Belgian candi sugar sweetness. Bushel's of lightly tart fruit load the palate: apples, white grapes, and apricots all come through. Belgian yeast and a mild spiciness slide over the back of the tongue but don't linger.

The taste is good but a little disappointing when judged against other belgian strong dark ales. Its a little too light and fruity as opposed to the rich and deep flavours I have come to expect from this style.

Aromas are fruity and phenolic, reminiscent of some abbey brown ales. Pears, a bit of white grapes, and some solvent grain alcohol underneath. A touch of sweetness initially on the palate, but that fades quickly to a well-balanced sweet/dry combination. Sharp, prickly carbonation on the sides of the tongue, along with some acidity, with apple esters and some phenols coming out in the mid-palate. Mouthfeel is lighter than I expected, with effective carbonation and some nice acidity that would aid in pairing with food. This is quite a nice beer, with the fruity esters, acidity, and sweet malts playing very well together.

The appearance is a ruby color with a nice creamy head and fair amount of carbonation - very enticing. The aroma of this beer is absolutely fantastic, sweet, cidery and grape like, it bore a strong resemblance to Rodenbach Grand Cru, although not as intense. I couldn't get enough of the smell, and the active carbonation maintained the aroma to the last sip. The taste was incredibly smooth, slightly tart with traces of fruit and sweet malt, but much less flavor then the aroma might indicate. However, when a beer is as well executed as this, I find it difficult to pinpoint dominant flavors, but each one I tasted was more enjoyable then the last. The mouthfeel was very nice, a perfect amount of carbonation to balance the richness, although at 10%, this was not nearly as syrupy as lesser made strong ales. The complexity of taste and perfectly balanced body really hide the high alcohol content, which combined with the wonderful aroma make this winter warmer dangerously drinkable! After tasting so many other holiday beers that are overwhelmed by a particular spice or flavor, it's the balance of this one that really makes stands out.","ccrida","Dec 13, 2006"

The taste was very smooth, sweet tastes of candies up front with spices all balanced with a nice malt backbone. Gave a nice warming sensation, good on a cool night! Can also notice a slight alcohol taste but being that this brew is 10% it is not over the top and goes well with the other flavor although I think I can only have one of these per session.

I liked the smell, it was just that you could plainly tell that there is alot of alcohol present here. The taste was quite malty with a very slight banana tone hidden in the finish. Truthfully, it seems the alcohol concealed most of what potential flavour profile was there. I like this one, it's just heavy on the alcohol and one should know that up front, lest they be quite dissappointed. The mouthfeel was quite nice in that it wasn't too heavy or too light, and the carbonation level was right where I like it to be for this style. Drinkability? This is a really big brew.

There were hints of chocolate and cream making the drink vaguely reminiscent of those gooey covered cherries that my mother enjoys finding under the tree.

Pours a dark brownish copper color with a tall mountainous light tan head that very slowly dissipates leaving coats of sticky lace on the walls of the glass as it does so. Nose is dark caramel and honey malts blended with some tropical fruit and a bit of bubblegum. Fairly full in body with a slightly chewy texture that envelops the tongue. Taste begins with caramelized malts and a bit of candied sugar followed by some notes of molasses and butterscotch and finally by some peppery and spicy alcohol. A great winter warmer and a very drinkable brew considering the 10% ABV.","Morris729","Mar 22, 2004"

Taste is smooth and silky to start with the dark fruit, candy, and alcohol then the spice hint of bitterness. For such a strong beer I felt that I could enjoy it all night. Nothing to overpowering here. This beer is Liquid Christmas in a bottle. Enjoy!","Stubbie1","Mar 14, 2004"

4.22,9,3.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,"This holiday beer pours a pretty amber-deep copper color that is quite striking in the light. It is topped by a thick tan head. It is well carbonated with bubbles escaping from the bottom of my glass in a frenzied stream. Smells lightly musty with dark fruit overtones that are accompanied by a slightly sharp spicy aroma. Tastes smooth and rich up front. A prickling carbonation coats the tongue as it slides down my throat. Finishes with a musty-yeasty-fusel type character which is a bit sharp. The fruitiness of this beer combines really well with the sweet-caramel-raisin dark malt character. This beer is dominated by the dark fruit character. It has a medium light body, which works well here. There is also some spice notes in this beer that remind me of coriander.","Gueuzedude","Jan 21, 2004"
3.91,1,4.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Pours a clear dark brownish-garnet in color with a creamy light tan head. Aroma consists of sweet fruity overtones, candied sugar, peppery yeast and alcohol. The mouthfeel is medium-bodied, creamy and smooth. Some sweetness upfront that is followed up with spices. Caramel malt and honey flavors near the middle. Alcohol is blended nicely and detected toward the back of the throat and provides a nice warming feeling on the way down. This is the first offering from this brewery that I've tried and so far, I've been impressed.","Winter","Jan 20, 2004"
4,3.4,4,4,4,4,4,"A bit more muted than I expected. Alcohol popped up right away with a peppery sharpness, and then a softer, slightly tart caramel wafted in to smooth things out. Some wine-like fruityness toward the finish. Very drinkable, particulary for the high abv.

Peppery in the front with grapes. But it blooms quickly to a thick, caramely sweet middle. Not sweet like the Tremens. The beer finishes dry. Spicy with some nice grains and plenty of alcohol (better hidden than the Nocturnum). This is a very nice, sweet Belgian.","kbub6f","Jan 17, 2004"

4.48,15.8,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,5,"Gently poured from the lees it's a clear, deep chestnut with an orange cast and brilliant ruby highlights. A full (but not huge) head of creamy, slightly yellowish foam very slowly receeds to a thin cap, holds throughout the entire goblet, and leaves splashes of lace about the glass. A slight mustiness parts readily to reveal a lively, slightly tart and juicy fruitiness (berries, cherries). Some yeastiness develops with notes of sugar candy and bubblegum spice. A delicately toasted and caramel sopped maltiness hovers beneath but never really comes to the surface itself. As it warms, notes of clove and honey become more dominant. Refreshing and enjoyable! The aroma alone is worth the trip! The body is light-medium and it's exceptionally fine, natural carbonation slides across the tongue with just enough of a caress to awaken the tastebuds before fading smoothly away. More caramelization appears in the flavor than the nose suggests, although it remains somewhat sugary and honeyish like cookie-dough. The fruitiness isn't nearly as bold as the aroma suggests, and what remains is more similar to sweetened blackberries. A clear note of alcohol becomes apparent but not distracting. Some mild spice carries through, and a very sublime bitterness helps to anchor it along with its drying alcohol. It finishes fairly short and dry with a delicate note of lingering honey-berry malt and subtle spice in the aftertaste. A most impressive holiday ale, and certainly worth a try!","NeroFiddled","Dec 25, 2003"

Warms the body and the soul, or could be the alcohol warming me, not strong in taste but kicks in on the way down. Great mouthfeel love the way the bubbles add to the flavor, medium body.

A bit of alcohol to the taste, but still a very sweet malt taste. Not what you would expect of a Christmas beer, but very good nonetheless. My overall rating from my 750ml bottle hasn't changed.

The lacing is strong but fades fast. It has a malty, fruity aroma with hints of nutmeg, cinnamon, and clove. It also has the distinct aroma of a strong ale with yeasty undertones. I love the taste of this if its served at about 50 degrees. Once it got really cold in the fridge, it lost a lot of the explosion that I got from the warmer brew. Its taste is malty but with hints of many spices. It fades a little in the mouth for a beer with this alcohol content. It packs a wallop so drinkability is good if shortened.","rdrummer","Dec 19, 2003"

Sugarplum maltiness mixed with spice and a significant alcohol-laden esteriness in the nose. Smells more alcoholy than it tastes. Beautiful, subtle spice and sweet fruity malt kick to it, a nice malt and yeast coalition leaving it dry and fruity in the finish. This beer is a ""sneaker"" if you're not careful.

Aroma: Sweet candied sugar, sugar plums, cinnammon and nutmeg combo dance through the air with each sniff and oh so pleasant pine scented hops. Taste: Full spicy nutmeg, with syrupy layers of pine cone flavored hops loads the palate with an alcohol tinge warming me up for the winter weather. Mouthfeel: Syrupy textured full to medium but each sip is definitely classified as rich, gotta love a winter warmer.

The red foil wrapping was a pain to peel off, but I liked all the yule themed pink elephants on the label. Pours an almost clear cherry mahogany with a serious off-white head. Chains of lacing prevail down the glass. Nose is fruity banana mango with Belgian malts in evidence. Mouthfeel is light to medium with carbonation evident. Taste is of a fine Belgian strong dark ale that puts the sweet malts to battle. Fruity sweetness seems to dominate the palate, but overall a nice departure from the norm. I like it a lot. Really too sweet, but with the 10% abv it hits the spot for me on a cold night.","merlin48","Nov 29, 2003"

In addition to a symphony of fruit, there is also the trademark coriander and light spiced feel in the mouth that makes for a most interesting seasonal brew.

Flavor lacked some of the holiday spiciness I was looking for, quite a lot of wine-like tartness and lacking some of the fleshy fruits and cinnamon bits.

Snap of bright, sugary red fruit reminscent of candied strawberries upfront in aroma, immediately followed by mellower caramel sweetness, and mild bubblegum esters. Trace clove phenol. Tame, but pleasant aromawise. Honey like sweetness initially in flavor is ceded by notes of bready malt and molasses. Fruitiness then sets in mid palate and doesn't waver, and contrary to the aroma has a vinous, alcohol soaked, fermented berry nature. Moderate in body with a well attenuated, dryish, deceivingly crisp mouthfeel. Subdued hop bitterness and clove eek along as an undertone. Finishes w/ residual sugars briefly lingering on the palate quickly offset by darts of peppery alcohol.

A very full-bodied beer, but I didn't really pick out too many flavors individually. I drank this one along side a glass of water to keep my palate cleansed and also to ward off what seemed to be a high alcohol content. The alcohol aftertaste didn't register that high, I just 'knew' this beer was strong, although I didn't know how strong until I checked it out here at BA.
