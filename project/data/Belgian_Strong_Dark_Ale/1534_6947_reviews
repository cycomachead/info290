"O - Wonderfully tasty beer.  Even non-beer drinkers could enjoy this one."
""
"Opaque brown body. ecru colored head with a bit of lacing but not as much as i would expect from a Belgian ale of this pedigree. Smell of dried fruits and chestnuts. Getting a real nutty flavor mixed with dark fruits, a bit sweet. The feel isn't really full and while good, it ends a bit too abrupt. I expected more from this one and have to admit to being disappointed."
"Pretty sweet overall, but also very complex and well-balanced for a dark Belgian strong."
""
""
""
""
"750ml bottle poured into a shaker pint. Three fingers of tan head settle to a nice cap and patches of lace leave evidence of the once great height. The beer is dark drown and mostly clear with sediment coming with later (or less gentle) pours. Aroma contains raisins, fig, caramel, cherries, and alcohol. Taste is sweet with molasses, candi sugar, dark fruits, and raisins. There is some spicy and mildly hoppy bitterness as well. Certainly a boozy burn on the swallow, but it doesn’t detract. Medium-full body, lots of creamy carbonation, creamy texture, semi-dry finish that allows the residual sugars to leave their mark."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Very nice brown beer, with a beige head. Malty aroma, combined with plum and raisin accent. The alcohol is remarkably present in the taste which causes for a port- or sherry-like taste. There is also a taste of spices to detect. Unfortunately the bottle was already opened a while before I drank of it, which compromised the taste a bit, especially the aftertaste. Will rate this again in the right circumstances."
""
"Very nice! Limited quantity at times, but should stock up! Recommended!"
""
"This is an awesome beer that should be on everyone's list to try.  Seeing other recent reviews, I guess I should get another and let it age?  Where's my car keys?"

"very rich, a real sipper.  taste of sweet raisins, tobacco and leather. need to share this one too rich to drink a full bottle."
"O: Overall this is a very smooth beer.  This beer has been crafted carefully over time and it is a mature and very well crafted brew.  Strongly recommended if you have never tried this before.  I had seen this for years and passed it by, probably due to its labeling which for whatever reason did not appeal to me."
""
"The 2014 edition pours a splendidly foamy 3 finger tan head over a dark chestnut body. There is a pleasantly musty yeast aroma. The mouthfeel is spectacular: lightly carbonated for the style but nonetheless with a lingering effervescence that I found unusual, and quite pleasing. The dark fruits, banana, and yeast are there with a mild sweetness that just manages to stop short of being too upfront.  The higher alcohol content is virtually unnoticeable. This is a spectacular BSDA that is a must try for anyone who is a fan of the style, or just anyone."
""
""
"A bottle of the 2014 edition.  Very dark brown, nice light brown head.  Smells nice and spicy.  Overall very well balanced.  I would like to put one of these down for a year."
"Smooth, full mouth feel. Sweet, complex fruits and mellow spice. An enjoyable beer, worth the wait."
""
""
"Sweet alcohol soaked dark fruits of raisons and plums, cola, Belgian yeast which flows into sweet cherries. Amazing brew."
""
""
""
"This is an ok beer"
""
""
"Overall, this was a really nice Belgian Strong Dark Ale. It really held up well from 2013."
""
""
"I'm really fond of this one. It has potency of flavors, and also balance. Not too sweet, nor too bitter. A quintessential example of a dark Belgian ale, if I do say so."

"O-I had been sitting on this bottle for a while and I'm glad I finally popped the cork because it was great. There is no barrel aged business to alter the flavors or provide unnatural sweetness and there is no effort to bury the alcohol -- you get what you get here, and what you get is a great, big beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"Serving type: bottle"
""
"In addition to previous comments, I'd say that the carbonation, although present, is very light so it doesn't get in the way of a spectacular flavor.  After nearly 2 years of searching for a beer to match or exceed my favorite - I have found it!"
""
""
"One of the better quads you can find."
"Bottle dated Nov. 21, 2013, pours a deep brown with a short-lived beige head. Light soapy lacing. The aroma has hints of dark fruit, caramel and spice. The taste is nothing short of spectacular. The aroma, plus vanilla and a delicious sweetness. Incredibly smooth body. This is a world-class Belgian beer."

"2014 (bottled in June, so slightly "
""
""
""
""
""
"O-what a great beer, could savor this all night"
"I really enjoyed this beer tonight.  Maybe it's a situational thing, as I had some salty food earlier, and the dark sweetness of this beer may have balanced that perfectly.  Definitely gonna grab this to make sure."

"O: A well constructed ale, but it’s a style I don’t really know what to do with it, being super fruity, sweet, and high alcohol.  I don’t partciularly feel like drinking it on its own, but I could see it pairing well with some beef stew or other dark meat dish."

"Poured a deep black with the slightest hints of deep amber. Bananas come through in the aroma predominately with hints of oak,plum, raisin, and vanilla. A lot of the same flavors come through in the taste with some cherry, chocolate, and red wine on the finish. Thick body with little carbonation. Alcohol is hidden fairly well. Great pickup! I can see how aging would make this golden!"

"O: Drank Feb 25, 2014 and this was a 2012 vintage brewed as stated on the bottle from Feb 24th, 2012.  Drank in Kunming China, so its practically the 24th in Belgium, and I only noticed this before pouring it and after chilling it tonight.  Coincidence?  I think not. Its been sitting on my shelf for months."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"This beer was such an interesting twist on what I had expected. First off the beer pours like a quad, light brown with a good amiunt of head. That was the best part of this beer. After that all I could smell and taste was sweetness. It's like the brewer took tons of sugar and mixed it with a pound of yeast and hops. A lot of these reciews say to age for 4 years before it becomes good. But why would you want to buy a beer you have to age that long before it becomes good. To me if they would have lowered the sweetness it could have been much better."

"Bit sweet for me, but there's a fair amount of love and care, and interest in big, boozey beers that's really plain here. I couldn't drink it all night and I probably wouldn't order another, but, you know, kudos?"

"O: This is very tasty. I have read some great reviews saying I should age longer... I would agree. I think this is fantastic brew, but slightly green. 2 years are just not enough to really pull the flavors that other reviewers are finding."
""
""
""
"The recommendation on this one it to age it for at least 4 years, we had a special occasion and had it 6 months early."
""
""
""
""
"O: that chick wasn't kidding - this is a real treat - she hoards this stuff like its a vaccine for the plague, always informs me that we are close to being out of stock... there seems to be a new case in every week, so I pay no mind... this may very well be in the top 3 of quintessential Belgian ""strong dark"" ales one must try - one to measure the style's greatness by"

"Final Grade: 4.26, a fabulous A-. Cuvée Van De Keizer Blauw is a world-class beer, but it's definitely not for everyone. The flavours are quite bold and the sweetness can border on cloying at times, with the high alcohol content being immediately noticeable. That being said - none of those are necessarily deal-breakers in this style, and it's probably my fault for cracking open such a young bottle anyway. This is a very solid Belgian strong dark ale that is worth seeking out for cellaring purposes. I know I'll be on the lookout for it, especially if the price remains so staggeringly low - $7.80 for a high-quality 11% Belgian beer is a virtual steal!"
""
""
""

"A great tasty BSDA, nicely in control of its abv. Pretty sure a wine barrel aged version of this would be incredible, until then, just very good."

""

"This is an excellent beer. The aroma and flavor are strong, complex, and truly delicious. Aging has worked for this beer. The oxidation qualities have completely worked alongside the already complex and delicious flavor. I didn't drink this alone, but I could have. It's a very good beer that deserves more attention than it gets. I wish I would have tried this side by side with a new bottle."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A perfect belgium beer, I will be buying again for sure"
""
""
""
"I'd say I'm not as blown away as I was the first time I tried this beer, but it's an excellent beer all the same. I may be biased because part of my mind wants me to love this beer as much as I did the first time, but it's not far off from that first experience."

"OVERALL- I have at this point had 3 or 4 bottles of Cuvee van de Kaizer, both blue and red. I am in the habit of consuming them between 3-5 years old. I have been both beautifully rewarded and horribly disappointed. I'm sure it all comes down to storage practices. If you are into cellaring beer, this is certainly one to try, and I'm sure a vertical project would be a very enjoyable experiment. I am always caught off-guard over and over by how Het Anker's huge, full-bodied beers float on the palate and offer up so many bright and spritely flavors."
"Overall: a classic which should be on every beer geek's list."
""
""
""
"O: Great, well crafted beer. Very delicious. Could drink it over and over. A good drunk too."
""
"O: Among the best belgian ales I've ever had. A great example of the style."
"Uma cerveja com certeza muito poderosa e de valor. Uma coisa que me incomodou um pouco foi o excessivo dulçor. Mas mesmo assim ela tem muita personalidade. É forte, marcante e com uma notável licorosidade. Foi uma honra degustá-la. Uma ótima experiência."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I expect a big Belgian to be on the sweet side, and this certainly hits that... maybe a little too sweet on the front of the tongue. Slight hop bitterness adds some needed contrast, and while some fruit esters are evident, they are somewhat mixed and indistinct under the sweetness. It would be interesting to see how this one ages further, but overall just too sweet for a 5 star rating in my estimation."
""
""
"This is really a great dark Belgian ale, but the sweetness is almost cloying and holds it back from being epic. Still makes a great after-dinner sipper."
"Overall this is a sweet but not overly so beer. Lots of malt complexity and fruityness and the very high ABV is surprisingly (and dangerously) well hidden. Try this."
""
"Very good. Worth trying if you like their other dark ales or Rochefort for example."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Price Point - $17.99/4 pk 11.2 oz bottles"
""
"I shared this with several friends and no one else liked it either. We can't all be wrong about this highly rated beer can we? Is it possible I got a bad bottle? I hope so."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this ale is delicious. The sweetest beer I have ever had."
""
""
""
""
"Overall this is a very nice Belgan Strong Dark Ale which I've enjoyed and am looking forward to seeing what happens to it by next year at this time.  However, that said I'm also thinking that I'm, to a degree, losing my taste for beers with much ABV regardless of how much I enjoy the flavors.  But for those who have not tried it I am happy to recommend it as something that has a well deserved place among those beer considered to be world-class."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: wow. Just... Wow. Yes please more."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is up there with the best of the Belgian Strongs I've had. YOu could use this for a clinic...the esters, the oak-y dryness, the body and balance. I'd like to see what this tastes like after a few more years in the cellar."

"Fresh from Ohoove's cellar into a pint glass this fine 2008 vintage brew shows a deep dark root beer color with a solid but thin light tan head and a nice broken sheet of lacing. The aroma brings a delicate but sweet currant and red wine theme with dark fruits. Very refined with none of the classic Belgian traits I often expect. Very nice but definitely concentrated on the wine idea. The flavor hits with more dark fruits over deep chocolate malt and champagne - red wine. There are some floral hints and cotton candy sweetness, but again, the dominant flavor combines red wine and sugary malt. The body is at least medium with modest carbonation and a pretty aqueous feel. Quite a tasty treat worth waiting for!!"
""
"EDIT ** March 8, 2015 - Had a bottle of this the other day and I actually feel like I've underrated this beer a little, as it was magical, velvety and really damn easy to drink especially as far as big beers go."
"The alcohol is well hidden. Granted, I'm having a 2012 vintage and it is over a year old, but still, so drinkable. A lovely sweetness and a great dessert beer."
""
"This was a great beer to drink. I just know what I like and this us one that works for me. I liked the way it pored into my tulip glass. At first it was a little over powering but as I got further into the beer it turned out great? Will be drinking this again."

"Has a sharp alcohol nose but the sweetness and mouthfeel hide the alcohol well. Slightly warming with a distinct raisin-like quality. Lacked the yeast candy of a bottle conditioned beer, it would be better with this extra yeast."

"A review of the 2013 batch:-) possibly the best looking brew I have seen in a while. Pours a dark ruby held up to the light it almost glows. A rocky head that persists all the way threw, sticking to the glass as you drink. Not the best smelling brew. Not a foul smell just not much to it. Heavy booze not with the slight fruity esters of Belgium yeast and not much else. Fortunately this does not translate over to taste. A taste of booze fruity esters, darkfruits , candy sugers . the mouth feel is smooth and velvety like an imperial stout. The carbonation seams to only add to head retention and does not dull the flavor at all. Trying to broaden my Belgium horizons, not a dad addition"

"750 ml bottle into tulip glass, 2010 vintage. Pours moderately hazy and cloudy dark reddish brown color with a 2 finger fairly dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Good spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of big caramel, raisin, plum, fig, molasses, toast, toffee, brown sugar, dark bread, dark candi sugar, pepper, light clove, light chocolate, light roast, and yeast earthiness. Fantastic aromas with huge complexity and great balance of dark malt and fruity/spicy yeast esters; with big strength. Taste of caramel, molasses, toast, raisin, prune, fig, brown sugar, toffee, dark bread, light chocolate, herbal, light roast, and yeast earthiness. Lingering notes of caramel, molasses, toast, brown sugar, toffee, raisin, prune, dark bread, light chocolate, light roast, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a while. Absolutely incredible complexity and balance of molasses/bready malt and dark fruit flavors; with a big malt presence and zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Light-medium carbonation and full bodied; with a creamy, slick, and lightly crisp mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a small warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is an absolutely incredible Belgian strong dark ale! All around incredible balance and complexity of dark malt and dark fruit flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the gravity. An insanely delicious offering."
""
"Very good, but I think the uber high score is due to the plethora of average Belgian Darks that are considered better than they are."
"O: Great beer. would definitely enjoy again, and will look for the RED to compare."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: a little disappointing given my very high expectations."
""
""
""
"Deep brown/ruby color with half finger of white foam. Nice sweet dark malts and dried fruit aroma. Similar flavor...dried fruit and dark coffee and lots of chocolate malts. Scary easy to drink as the abv is +10. Really nice brew, but a tad over sweet for me."
"A: Finger of foam that fell pretty quickly leaving a few spots of lace along the interior of the glass, deep burgundy to maroon in color, nice presentation in a caged and corked bottle – 4.25, S: Strong aromas of plums, figs and molasses, lots of distinct smells that remind me of maraschino cherries and fruitcake, some chalkiness and a touch of candied sugar – 4.50, T: Slightly medicinal, significant alcohol burn, sweet caramel malt flavors as well as dark fruits including, sweetness borders on cloying, great deal of spiciness and even a bit of port, lots going on in this beer – 4.25, M: Creamy and velvety with a drying aftertaste presumably from the high alcohol – 3.50, D: A very nice example of the style though a slight departure from the Belgian Strong Dark Ale that I tend to prefer, incredibly complex and turning up new flavors and smells by the sip – 4.00"
"Beer is medium to medium-heavy in body with medium-low carbonation intensity, resulting in a foamy, smooth, fairly thick mouthfeel. Ethanol heat can be slightly felt in the nostrils and back of throat when the beer becomes warm, quite good for an 11% ABV beer. Closes semi-dry, with substantial stickiness on the palate."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The 2000 years bottles are quite rare to get. Hopefully if you will find one! Than you have a very special and a fantastic collector's item."
""
""
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel & Overall: soft and lubricating on the palate, this full-bodied and fulsome vintage strong ale is absolutely gorgeous, ageing well following a good 7 years in the bottle, never tasting sickly or heavy as far as my palate is concerned. The time has been well spent, I think, but this is not to say a younger vintage would’ve been any less complex."
""
""
"This is a beer that lives up to its reputation.  Pours a beautiful deep dark brown with a thin head.  The smell is pure Belgian. Dark fruits, malts, Candi and yeast. The taste is rich and sweet and has potential to improve with age.  One of the standards of the style, and a fantastic sipper."
""
""
""
"O: I'm amazed that such a monster can be so well balanced, and the obvious lack of hops presence (whatsoever) can still lend to a dry, balanced beer. The beer is tilted toward the malt, caramel, and dark fruit flavors of a classic quad/strong dark ale, but this one remains a classic in my eyes, and the expected gummy/ sugary flavors of the Corolus yeast are tamed by the candy sugars and residual sugar of the malt monster. I will continue to buy these each year for the rest of my life."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - A touch of tartness adds a twist to the Belgian spices and earthiness."
""
""
"Overall. Much better than I expected it to be. Good stuff."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Bottom Line: Well made beer!"
""
"This beer is fantastic! Normally for beer, or any kind of liquor, one has to search for flavor and have an immensely discerning palette in order to extract all of the flavors; not this time. This beer aged is probably the BEST DARK BEER EVER MADE, or at least that I've tried. This beer brazenly smacks you in the face and tells you what it tastes like; it's like hunting in a forest with no trees and large game animals at a stand still; the flavors are immensely dominant."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Overall I really liked the beer and I would most definitely drink it again. It's a very good example of a Belgian Strong Dark Ale. I did not find it too sweet, malty, or syrupy. I did find that it had a lot of flavor, complexity, and body. It is very easy to drink, but a person should be careful because of the high alcohol content that does not rear its head too much in the flavor or mouthfeel."

"pours a darker brown color with a very light head. smell is very sweet and the taste is even sweeter. strong raisin / fig taste. i wasn't expecting this to be so sweet, but it's a very nice surprise. tastes more like a quad. alcohol is very well hidden, i'd guess this was an 8%er as opposed to the 11% ABV. overall obviously this one is a sipper but one i'd seek out again. i'd like to try different years to experience the difference aging makes."
""
""
"Not real high on my list of Belgian Darks."
""
""
""
"Pours a dark brown color. 1/4 inch head of an off-tan color. Good retention and good lacing. Smells of tartness, sourness, sweet malt, slight pale malt, and a hint of hop. Fits the style of a Belgian Strong Dark Ale. Mouth feel is smooth and clean, with a low carbonation level. Tastes of sweet malt, alcohol, slight pale malt, hint of roasted malt, slight hop, slight dark citrus, and slight yeast. Overall, good appearance, feel, body, and complexity."
""
"Carbonation could be just a bit higher."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall – A rather nice Belgian strong dark with a big sweet dark fruit flavor and a nice lighter boozy and yeasty spiced flavor that rounds out the sweet well when mixed with a lighter malty taste. It is overall quite enjoyable."
""
""
"Pouring a very dark brown, black almost, with reddish brown highlights, this beer is capped with a dense, light brown head with excellent retention and very nice lacing. The nose is a spice bomb. A blend of mace, nutmeg and anise, with some eucalyptus, cola, mildly burnt sugar, this is a little too spiced for my liking. The cola notes here bring to mind discount sodas. Alcohol is reasonably well hidden. In addition, there's quite a bit of dark fruit present, with prunes and figs."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a lovely beer. I'm sure it would age well, and I would recommend letting it warm to 52F before even popping the cork. Not something you could session and definitely a slow sipper, but this is a lovely , big Belgian Strong Dark Ale, with all the intricacy you would expect, and more."
""
""
"Appearance is near immaculate: deep ruby red with a dense light tan head. Lacy residue coats the glass interior over the course of consumption. Smell is fruity & delightful: prune notes over warm malt. Mouthfeel is smooth, rich, and creamy as all-get-out. Tastes royal: the prune and the malt play hopscotch across the courtyard of my tongue, like an emperor in waiting. Finishes as smooth as it began. Deceptively alcoholic. Please be sure to have a comrade to help you with the bottle. Who is Keizer Söze?"

"D: do yourself a favor and let this thing warm up. I didn't even realize that this beer had a year plus on it when I picked it up from a Total Wine in VA. Glad it was tucked away on the bottom shelf and out of direct light. im would imagine it is not much different fresher, but I like it just like this. well done."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I didn't find a great deal of difference between this Belgian Strong Dark Ale and a top shelf Belgian Quad. I've had Westvleteren 12, and my 2011 Cuvée Van De Keizer Blauw (Blue) was not far behind. Both are great examples of the sweet candied fruit, high ABV, complex flavored, and finely crafted beers that Belgium is noted for. I've cellared some of my stash to drink in later years to see what changes occur. This was a beautiful thing to sip and savor from a snifter."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Simply amazing. This is one of the most complex beers I've ever had, but it's so balanced. The taste is maybe a tad sweet, but I'm splitting hairs. An array of dark fruits, spice, a bit of caramel, what more do you want in a BSDA?"
"Stellar stuff. Aged vs. fresh is no comparison, although, no need to mind snagging one off the shelf and cracking it open that night. It's still that good."

"On tap at Kickbacks in Jax. Poured into a snifter. 1/2009 vintage. Light tan head, moderate retention on a hazy, murky greyish, tudor brown body. Aroma includes notes of vanilla, cherry, some alcohol still, fig, raisin, molasses. Taste follows suit, actually no alcohol noted on tasting and the syrupy/molasses dominates with some sherry and port notes added in. Amazing beer, highly drinkable with such a high abv. Extra layers of complexity added with the 4 years of age."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Het Anker and their Gouden Carolus brews are thoroughbred Belgian ales. This is the best of the best and is done in a traditional Belgian style. Its complex yet balanced flavors are truly stunning and it's beautifully colored body claims perfection. Perfection is a word that's boldly used in the craft beer world, but this Belgian gem just may be what perfection is all about. I'll buy this beer everytime I see it. I'm going to seek out the 2013 when it's released to try it fresh, but for now the 2011 that's been sitting awhile is out of this world good."
""
"O - A tasty brew that loads the palette with sweetness, but is easily enjoyed without worry of overwhelming the palette. An incredibly tasty and easy drinking 11% brew that is dangerously easy to consume. Glad I was able to grab a bottle because it was well worth it."

"O: a very complex and interesting beer. As a Belgian Strong Dark, it has the qualities that make this style great, but perhaps it needs to be turned down a notch. It's cloyingly sweet, yet tasty. Give it a go."
""
""
"very very nice BDSA, not too sweet, definitely packs a punch, tasty and complex, evolves well as reaching room temp. i will have it in any special occasion, its a sipper thou, took me a whole afternoon to finish the 750 ml."

"Cheers!!!"

"O - tremendous beer. Extremely drinkable at this abv."
""
""
""
""

"O: Wonderfully crafted yet immensely enjoyable. Right up there in the same conversation as Rochefort 10 and St. Bernardus 12 in my mind."
""
""
""
"M - Medium body. Creamy. Moderate carbonation."
"A dark Belgian ale that holds up in size to the big quads like Rochefort 10 and St. Bernardus Abt. 12. I wouldn't say I like it quite as much as those two beers, but it comes close enough and offers enough of a unique flavor that I will make Cuvee Van De Keizer Blauw part of my rotation of dark Belgian ales."
"Overall: all around great Belgian beer. Verdict A+"

"Wow I wish I picked up more then one bottle of this. Pours a dark reddish brown with good head. Tastes on the sweet side, with dark fruits and brown sugar coming through. Incredibly easy to drink for being 11% alcohol. I was really suprised by that, no burn what so ever. This is one of the better belgian strong dark ales I have had in awhile. Delicious stuff."
""
""
"Medium body, decent carbonation, sticky on the lips."
""
"I had the lions share of the bottle and knew I'd had enough when I stopped drinking and started making my notes: just about readable!"
"Brown with ruby highlights, cap of off white head, lots of lace here as well. Smell is full of dark bread and fruit, plum, raisin, bruised banana, lots of sweet caramels and dark sugars, some yeasty notes in here as well. Taste is full of dark bread and brown sugars, dark fruits, plum, raisin, dark berry and jam like, a bit of yeast, fairly sweet darker sugars, just a small hint of alcohol. Light-med carbonation, full bodied with a creamy smooth feel. Solid stuff here, alcohol goes largely undetected, good stuff that will get better with age, perhaps a bit too sweet to tackle a full bottle alone again though."
""
""
""
""
""
"Very nice strong ale, will certainly get again. Lots of complexity, good flavours. Nice evening sipper."
""
""
""
""
"O- damn good... up there with the trappiest quads"
"Overall - Quite the beer.. the scent is pretty basic for a belgian dark, but the flavour is very complex. I can pick up on the booze a bit but this is a 2012 so some age would help with that I'm sure. Every beer from this brewer is a winner in my books."
""
""
""
"O: Very unique BSDA. I have a hard time deciding if I like it or not. Loaded with fruits but has a certain odd tart wine-like aspect that I'm not a fan of. Very complex, yes. But tasty and enjoyable? Not so sure about that one."
""
""
""
""
""
"This was the 2012 vintage that I got a glass of at a tasting. I've seen this on the shelves plenty and never bothered to pick one up, good thing. Dark brown almost black color. Smell is sickly sweet fruits and belgian yeast. Flavor is more of the same, a heavy melange of spices, fruits, sugary sweetness, just overwhelming. This was not bad it was just too much."
""
""
""
"Overall? LORD YES. If you pass this up count yourself a fool. Remember Het Anker for it is a world-class 19th Century Belgian jewel. And YES I did stay overnight there in 2012."
""
""
"O: It is so incredibly difficult to match what the Belgians do so easily with their big beers. In an era when sub 300 bottle counts are king and the readily available is oft avoided, this is a reminder to pick up these traditional beers off the shelf more often."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A beer like a fine port wine. Lots of sweetness and complexity. Wonderful brew for sipping."
"This is one of my favorites. The fruit aroma is so strong and the malt presence in taste is so different. A very complex sipping beer that hides its alcohol well."
"Overall A very good brew, will drink again"
"This beer is monstrous and rich, very heavy, and definitely a sipper. It's almost overwhelmingly rich and flavorful and borders on being just a tad too much. It's very sweet and will not appeal to fans of dryer, more tart, or hoppier beers because of this. However, it is quite good for what it is and I am going to thoroughly enjoy this experience. However, there are a number of other Belgian ales in this class that I think balance their flavors a little better."
"O- Now I see why this has such high acclaim. Sure, it's a bit hot but it's a perfect wintertime brew...too bad it's August but that's why I'm definitely cellaring one of these bad boys!"
"I tried this beer based on the amazing ratings. It tastes like wine. I don't recommend this beer if you are a fan of IPAs, ales, or beer. It tastes like wine. Pick up a St Sebastians golden Belgian ale instead. I would have trouble picking this over even budweiser to be honest."
""
""
"Great beer. A brew that will sneak up on you at 11%. Easy to drink"
"Review from 2/2010 notes. Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Pours a dark mahogany brown with ruby highlights. Nice off-white one finger head with good retention and lacing. Aroma of dark and caramel malt, dark and dried fruit, slight cherry and a hint of Belgian spicing. Flavor is intense dark and dried fruits, caramel malt and delicious light tartness with fruits dominating middle and finish with slight hops in the finish. A bit on the sweet side, but the complex flavor carries this ale through. Medium to heavy bodied with some creaminess. A very nice dark Belgian."
"Overall: This beer is a gem, I honestly couldn't push it any more. You want to talk about a quality brew this is it. I absolutely cannot complain, well maybe only one I want more! Salud"
"B+"
""
"Absolutely fantastic stuff. Clean, balanced but also masterfully complex and deep. The alcohol is so well hidden, and hidden in a light, airy way that only the Belgians do. It makes it supremely drinkable despite its hefty ABV. Oh yes, this is a phenomenally good beer: and so effortless. Absolutely amazing."

"What a gem and a lucky find on my part. Now I have to try to find a better BSDA (which is going to be tough)."
""
"Fantastic, non-hyped beer that I can't wait to age."
""
""
""
"Overall this is exactly what I was hoping it would be. So glad I took other BAs' advice over the year and picked up a few bottles from each vintage: 2010, 2011, and 2012. Will continue to do so as long as they keep making it."
""
""
""
"O/D - Absolutely delicious. A great example of a dark Belgian beer. Flavourful and so balanced. Easy to drink but so worth savouring. Probably one of the best beers I've ever had."
""
""
""
"Overall: what a delicious beer. I was worried from the low-key smell that this beer would not be as wonderful as I'd hoped, but in the end it's delicious and drinkable despite its huge ABV. Wonderful stuff."

"originally reviewed: 11-15-2010"
"Overall - It's got good flavors but so much sweetness and booze that it's not quite a good beer. Above average at best. I'm surprised by the reviews. Perhaps this needs time to mellow."
""
""
""
"D - Dense, sugary malt with lots of yeast character but an excessively sweet finish. Oddly cloying for a beer that I remember being much dryer and more balanced the last time I had it. Not a drain pour but a bit of a disappointment."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Damn tasty beer right here. Dark chestnut brown in color, mostly translucent, with a small off-white head that receded to a tiny ringlet, but still left a bit of lacing on the glass. Aroma rich with honey and dark fruits. Taste is dominated by rich sugars--honey and molasses, mainly--and prunes, afterthoughts of bready yeast, raisins, cotton candy, earthy hops. Full of flavor, heavy-medium body, and quite a pleasant drink overall. Cheers!"
"O: very good beer, but tough to drink half of the bomber. I'd grab it again some time, even at $8 per bottle or whatever it was. The sweetness I got from this 2011 version kept this beer from being absolutely fantastic."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Very enjoyable, the taste and the smell of the alcohol are very well hidden. A really great beer though I would recommend more sipping (considering the ABV) than as a session beer. I will get this one again."
""
""
""
"O- 11%ABV? This look like 7-8%ABV, showing amazing balance and drinkabilty. Still it is highly complex and satisfyingly rich. An awesome beer"
"A very good beer. One I would enjoy again."
"O- Very good Belgian strong dark ale! Like the sweet dark fruits and flavors from the yeast as well."
""
""
"Overall, an excellent beer. No disappointment here. This is a wonderful beer and one of the best BSDAs I have had."

""
""
""
""
""
""
"Perfect for contemplation of memories or reading as one sips. Enjoyed this in a tulip glass, as that is what was available, however, I would have preferred a chalice or snifter."
""
""
"O- Pure decadence from start to finish. A must try for any belgian fan. Also a great beer to have in the cellar for an impromtu celebration. So stop reading the reviews and just get some already."
"OVERALL: Really flavorful and enjoyable, but could have used a touch more bitterness after the swallow. A slightly heavier feel would have added a touch as well. Still, these are minor points, as this is a world-class brew for sure and I’m not surprised it gets such high scores on this site. Worth drinking lots of, and worth tracking down if it isn’t distributed to your area, especially if you’re a fan of the style. Highly recommended."
"O - A great belgian that I finally got around the try. Can't wait to try this with some age on it."
"O- i like it, very alcoholic and tasty. had half a mind to give the taste a 4.5, really wish i could give it a 4.25 but anyway, its a tasty drop. and i would definitely have it again."
""
""
"O: This is one of the more sugary Belgians on the market, but that is part of its charm. the licorice elements sort of reminds me of their Easter entry."
"Malty, caramel and with a bit of chocolate. I'm just not impressed with this beer. But then I'm never been impressed by this brewery either. Bit mucky and one dimensional for my tastes."
"O - A really sweet, complex and delicious beer. Quite filling, in fact while it's sweetness and mouthfeel, make it delicious, they also make it very filling. Not one I can have more than one or two of after a meal. I always keep at least one bottle in the cabinet."
""
""
"Medium bodied with excellent carbonation, this beer is deceptively drinkable at 11% ABV. The body may seem a bit light but certainly does not hinder the flavors nor become sticky. The carbonation is rather fizzy when the beer is held in the mouth but does not seem to effect the experience much."
""
""
""
""
"I don't recall where I got this, but I want some more."
""
""
""
"Wow - tremendous stuff here. Sip and enjoy this one. Excellent."
""
"O-I'm a fan but not a big fan of the style,yet. However from where I stand(sit) this sample is quite impressive. My Belgian adventure will continue thanks to this high quality brew."
"I love this style and this is simply a must try. An amazing brew here."
""
""
""
"Overall - An excellent beer... Up with the best of the dark Belgain ales... Highly recommended..."
""
"Overall, just another winner from Het Anker."
""
""
"O: Decent. Given the ABV, I was expecting more intensity or something more pronounced in the flavors."
""
"We really enjoyed this beer I will be looking for it again as a great holiday treat."
"I bought this on a whim and I'm glad I did!"
""
""
""
""
"This thing is pretty wonderful. I was hoping to keep it around for a little bit before cracking it, but I broke down and I'm glad I did. If the sweetness and alcohol levels were toned down ust a tad this would be a home run. It's still amazing, like a Bengie Molina triple."
"wow this is really something special. on tap at the bull and bush in denver. 10oz goblet for 7 dollars, reasonable. looks like a holiday beer, with a deep mahogany color and a thick thick white belgian head. smells very fruity with a fresh baked bread sort of aroma as well, mild spice. flavor is dried fruits and a touch of spice. its a little sweet but incredibly well balanced and interesting. alcohol pokes through a little in the finish. mouthfeel is fantastic, smooth and fuller bodied. this is an outstanding beer, one i had never heard of before, but one i will absolutely seek out in the future."
"Notes: smooth, sweet & warming. I can hardly wait to see what cellaring will do to this tasty beer."
"Overall I like this but I'm wondering if it would benefit from some aging as it's a little hot and a little one dimensional. I plan to pick up another bottle or two and try it again after some time."
""
"O - Overall, this is pretty good. A little sweet but still has enough going on to make it an enjoyable beer. It's not quite in the same league as some of the other major Belgians dark ales and quads. Would recommend giving it a try."
""
"Pours a hazy burnt copper hue which leaves a one finger head and a rim of lacing,the smell is really strong boozy alcohol and i mean strong with also raisins soaked in brandy and xmas pudding,the mouthfeel is like a liquid pudding its thick and fullfilling with tastes of cherry brandy,raisins,candied figs,brown sugar,port,apple crumble and the finish is like a nice port sweet,warming,dry and very boozy and overall this one bottle is more than enough thank god i didnt get a 6litre but its a great Xmas drop in my eyes and palette cheers."
""
"O-This is my favorite beer of all time and ive had many! Just a beautiful well rounded beer that has so much to offer."
"O- One really nice brew. Easily up there with Abt 12, Rochefort 10, and Chimay Blue yet it doesn't seem to get nearly as much attention. The only real knock I have against it is the murky pour but maybe I hadn't given it enough time to settle after grabbing it from the fridge. Very tasty and one I will pick up again."
""
""
""
""
"Formidable - but it could use some food."
""
"Although present, the alcohol isn't nearly as pronounced in the taste as it is in the smell. A superb balance makes this brew dangerously drinkable. Sweet and spicy plums are present with delicious Belgian candy and a gentle alcohol warming. I plan to grab a few to cellar for later if I have the patience."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I would really put this beer out there as a good example of luxuriousness in beer."
"A unique take on the style, though not one I'm particularly crazy about. It seems a little over-the-top, a little out of control for me - I would be interested in trying an older bottle."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured from a 750 ml bottle into a goblet 2010 edition. Popping the cork I can smell the dark fruit from 3 feet away, I have high expectations. This pours a hazy dirty dark brown with a small off white head which almost instantly dissipates. The smells are strong full of ripe dark fruit along with a little alcohol. Feel is medium with high carbonation. The taste is like it smells, lots of ripe dark fruit, some brown sugar a little alcohol born all around tasty."
""
"O: For a brew of this ABV with such a multidimensional taste and smell, the drinkability factor is fantastic. Well done!"
""
""
""
"O: A very good example of the style. It is a bit young and bold right now, but with another year in the cellar I can see this one becoming something extraordinary."
""
"This is an excellent beer. It would be great for dessert. More sweet and caramelly than other quads, but it does it right. Not cloying, just outstanding."
""
"Overall this is one of my favorite beers from one of my favorite styles. I believe that I enjoy the 2008 vintage better than the 2010 that I had a few months ago."
""
""
""
"Overall: i'd buy this and cellar it in a heartbeat. we had another bottle of this that we opened 2 years ago and we were relatively unimpressed. this cellared one, tho....yeah. me likies."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"D/O: As I worked through the 22-ouncer, the sweetness began to wear on me. It's a good beer, but I think I only really enjoy it in smaller quantities."
"O: This was the first ""expensive"" beer I bought when getting into craft beer. Really opened my eyes back then and was just as enjoyable the second time around."
"O - A very nice after-dinner beer. One has to try this and buying it over and over again!"
"O - This 2010 bottle isn't very impressive. It's not a bad beer, but just rather average. Reading some other reviews, it seems I may be in the minority with my opinion, but when compared to the various Trappist strong dark ales, this one just doesn't stand up."
"Ultimately, there isn't much sifference between the 3, but they're all very good. I prefer the 2009, but it's a very slight difference. It's just a bit smoother and not quite as sweet. Still, I think this beer could age well for 5+ years."
"O: A good beer that would probably be best aged, so that the alcohol is muted. However, I believe that Unibroue's Terrible is a similar and better Belgian Strong Dark Ale."
"O: A solid beer and easy to drink. Rich flavors were smooth and complex."
"Excellent beer. Everything you want from a Dark Belgian Strong. Nice sweet burnt sugar flavor with a few tricks thrown in to keep it interesting."
"Pours a clear root beer color with a 1/2 inch tan head that fades to an oily film. Broken rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is awesome with sweet biscuit-like malt, caramel, molasses, dark fruits, and alcohol aromas. Taste is exactly like the smell with a very sweet and rich set of complex flavors. This beer has a good carbonation level with a crisp and slightly prickly mouthfeel. The alcohol hits the back of the throat with each sip and creates a warming on the drink down. Overall, this is a very good beer with awesome dark fruit/molasses flavors."
"Overall: very smooth given the abv. Good mix of flavors, would have it again."
"Overall: I am picky about my belgian strong dark ales beers and this one is not one I loved."
"A bit too heavy and sweet to drink it very often, but great as a finish of a wonderful dinner."
"O: Overall, this is really quite a fantastic beer. I would say its significantly better than any other Belgium Strong Dark Ale I’ve had and that includes Chimay Blue and Rochefort 8. If the palate profile was a little more complex (some other characters to match that sugary dark fruit sweetness) it would be in my top handful of all-time favorite beers, but nonetheless, it is very good and definitely a must try for fans of Belgium ales."
"Overall another excellent beer from Het Anker, incredibly drinkable, complex, and smooth. Will continue looking out for more beers from Het Anker which is becoming one of my all time favorites"
"D - amazingly complex and full flavor. Body and aroma are everything you would expect from a Belgium beer. Definitely a beer to savor and sip."
"Overall Impression- For having a ton of Belgian Strong Darks lately (multiple Grand Crus), this one is highly recommended by me! Rich, Complexed, but even better has a gritty taste that makes you want more of it throughout each drink. Perfect brew to share with someone. I'm not sure if I would drink a whole 750ml by myself, unless I was only having 1-2 in a night."
"Appearance 4/5; Aroma 4/5; Taste 4.5/5; Mouthfeel 4.5/5; Overall 4.5/5"
"T: Burnt raisins, brown sugar, brandy glazed fruitcake and baking spices. Mouthfeel is a little on the thick side, but this is an amazing beer."
"O: Extremely enjoyable to drink. Fruit overpowers the malt backbone. This beer is a liquid dessert but not so sweet as to limit it's drinkability."
"Deep ruby/burgundy brown, tan head with good lace, slightly bubbly/soapy, smells of cherries, plums, chocolate, alcohol, and yeast. Tastes amazing; a lot of banana, cherries, raisin, plum, a bit of alcohol and caramel. Very complex. Mouthfeel is perfect: on the fuller side of medium bodied, smooth and creamy with bubbly carbonation in the middle and a resinous finish...Just spectacular overall...Reminds me of Three Philosophers and Quad (weyerbacher) with a bit of Unibroue Terrible but is definitely it's own unique beer. Well-crafted, and will be an addition to the ever-expanding cellar."
"The feel is less appealing than the taste which carries a nice spice flavor with gentle cinnamon and come cocoa from the malt which also provides a light biscuit element and a mild flavor of apple from the yeast with mild molasses tinges and slight grainy flavor with some dark sugar notes in the the later sips as it nears cellar temperature. The flavor becomes more alcoholic and spicy as it warms with some slight cedar elements and mild medicinal tinges which augment the deep molassess quality from the malt. I enjoyed this -it was certainly a nightcap beer for me -the intensity at 11% makes that seem a reasonable statement and it displays some of the abv in the flavor and aroma which detracts from an otherwise top quality quad."
"This beer poured out as a brownish red color in the light. The head was fluffy and light tan in color. The smell of the beer is slightly sweet, lots of Belgian yeast and dark malt aromas in this one. The taste of the beer gets better as it warms up, it had some really nice spices in there that mixed well with the malts. The mouthfeel is medium bodied and had a pretty good amount of carbonation to it. Overall it's a pretty good Belgian brew, not much to complain about here."
"I tried this during Julio's Belgian Beer Festival on August 14, 2011. It pours a handsome looking dark amber to mahogany brown with red hues affixed to the side of the glass. The head is thin but long lasting. There is an enticing balance of sweet malts and a zing of hops on the nose. The body ends up at about medium to good. As for the taste think of smooth candied sweetness and a slightly harsher finish to remind you of what you have just experienced. Very drinkable in the end."
"Sustained Taste: Nice lingering of booze, maple, licorice and vanilla. Seriously, there is just no room for improvement."
"Overall an excellent beer. I've had several vintages aged at various lengths. My favorite has been 2006, but aged for four years, the 2007 is also quite delectable."
"Overall this has some nice, sweet flavors and quite an enjoyable taste. I keep going back to this between other tastes to sip on."
"Pours a hazy brownish orange. A nice touch of yellowed head. Looks pretty decent. Smells heavily of raisin and plum. A nice touch of vanilla. Tastes boozy and sweet. Raisin and vanilla with a nice thick mouthfeel. Caramel and burnt sugars. Smooth and rich, well carbonated and very tasty."
"Overall, exceptional so long as you are in the mood for sweet."
"O: I like this beer for what it is; Its very solid for the style. I think I expected more from this from it's place on the top 100 and mentions of it all the time. It fell slightly short of my expectations but is still a solid BSDA. I'm positive I would enjoy this beer with a lot more time on it though, it is a very hot %11, it makes no efforts at hiding it. I want to grab another bottle and hide it to enjoy years from now."
"I think this is part of what beer tasting is all about. There have been some brews that I have enjoyed more than you can imagine and can not wait to have it again, while there are some while others rave about its characteristics, it all becomes so subjective in the end"
"Notes: Cuvée Van De Keizer Blauw is brewed on February 24th every year on the birthday of Charles V."
"O: Really good. This is all around tasty and wonderful. Quite drinkable, I think. But look out, it's 11%. Go have one."
"O: Amazing brew. Got this on a recommendation from the guy at the liquor store, and I'm glad I asked. Will definitely buy this again."
"Smells of lemon zest and fruit. Pours a rich mahogney hue. Smooth, balanced taste, like liquid fig/fruit cake. Rich in raisins, currants, and candied sugar that masks the alchol beautifully. Not heavy, not light, a sipper beer that goes down way too easily. Highly recommended; extremely palatable; very delectable."
"O-this is a great beer. i highly appreciate the uniqueness in this one. i rarely get a new belgian that really surprises me. i could this whole bottle and will be searching this one out."
"A very good beer, although the feel was a bit thin, but not in a way that really detracted from overall enjoyment."
"O: Really, really pleasant. A sipper that could sneak up on you."
"Overall: really good beer, that you can just go buy in the beer store at any time. I really dig this one, might have to age one."
"O: A very well made beer, not sure it lived up to my expectations, but its still very good. Would like to try it again someday."
"Poured a brown body with minimal head that dies and leaves lace patches. The malts come out in full force in the aroma, complete with a dry woodiness/nutty yeastiness and there is a minor sweet touch and some fruit flavors I pick up. Smooth, medium-bodied, almost creamy mouthfeel that makes for an easy to drink brew. I pick up tart fruit like cherry and something akin to apple or plum and also a touch of citric like orange. Also a good deal of residual sticky sweet malt. Caramel, figs, possibly chocolate (possibly) - no matter there is some definite sugary goodness in here and it is balanced w/ the fruits and combines with the yeast for a sweet and also dry (also bready) malt balance. Lots going on and then it finishes real crisp, not due to ABV which is well-hidden, but due to some minor clove and pepper spices. All in all a fruity, sweet and dry ale that doesn't taste heavy and is a dangerously great sipper."
"If you are a fan of the Three Philosophers, Black Albert or other strong Belgian style beers that are just a touch sweet, then I would definitely give this beer a try."
"O- This vintage of Gouden Carolus Grand Cru of the Emperor is simply the best I've had. It's definitely one of the best beers I've ever had, and I will continue to look for this one everytime I go beer shopping. Highly recommended, especially if you like this style. Cheers!"
"The beer pours a dark brown color with slightly ruby highlights. The beer is capped with a creamy foam that left lacing down the glass. Dark fruit, raisins, dates and the like, mix with boozy esters in the nose. Layers of aroma waft into the nose. A significant body to this brew, and lots of character. The dark fruit is overlain with dark roasted malts. Sweet but not quite syrupy. The alcohol peppered the profile and provided ample warmth. The beer has respectable complexity and depth of flavor, a certain desired richness. This beer is well suited for yet another chilly May night in Minnesota."
"The CPJ"
"O: Blauw is probably one of the best beers in its style and one that I'm sure would benefit greatly from a little bit of age. The flavor, complexity, and body is there, but this beer needs to be just slightly less alive and a bit smoother. Still, I haven't come across many other BSDAs that are better than this offering. Definitely worth a try."
"Re-reviewed November 13, 2011. Part of the QuadShowdown. Beautiful softness to the nose, plums, dark fruits, sugar/brown sugar. Concise, condensed and exceptional bouquet. Taste reflects the nose quite well. Plums, brown sugar, vanilla, light syrup. Gentle and complex. Soft carbonation, full feel and a touch of back-end alcohol. Absolutely outstanding BSDA/Quad, great complexity, feel and smoothness. 4/45/45/5/5"
"O - This is a really beautifully-crafted beer. It tastes fantastic, looks and smells quite good...A really great beer. I am going back and buying the store out of these bottles. Would love to see this one age a bit more."
"Mouthfeel is good, simple and drinkable."
"The flavor brings more of the same, with an awesome bouquet of Belgian yeast and dark fruit. The beer is still a bit sweet, and could easily sit in the cellar for a few more years. Alcohol presence is noticeable throughout, particularly in the finish. Overall, a terrific beer and a great addition to one's cellar."
" D: Quite drinkable. Split this one with my wife"
"D: One bottle is definitely enough, but this brew is extremely deceptive because the 11% is nowhere to be found in the taste or nose"
"I've been passing this beer by at local stores for years. I finally decided to grab one, and I am sure it will not be years until I buy another. Complex, balanced, and strong without being unpleasant, this beer is a classic."
"D: Honestly, I do not find this beer drinkable at all. It is way too sweet, and I don't even know if I can finish a single glass, let alone an entire 750 bottle. So unbalanced, and if I wanted something that tasted like this I would buy some grape syrup."
"So incredibly rich that it might be difficult to finish. This is absolutely one to share, so while tasty, this begs for moderation."
"D - While this is a bit expensive for a bottle you get a lot so is very drinkable."
"Overall, this really is an outstanding beer. It's been sitting on the shelves at my beer store for years and I've always overlooked it, well I'm glad I finally jumped on this as it's a fantastic brew."
"Truly terrific!"
"D - A very solid quad but will get better with age, at least five ye4ars on this one. Good job I bought two !"
"Thick, syrupy, and delicious. A nightcap sipper and should be shared with a friend."
"Drink- After it's done the 11% really hits you. Big Flavor, Big Beer. This was really good. Couldn't do two in sitting. One and done."
"jd"
"Despite the very perceptible sweetness quotient, a decent balance is deftly maintained - so no real sugar overload manifests - all amidst an agreeable, and at times, locally inexplicable drying character, though booze and underground hops seem to be the prime suspects. Not so weirdly drinkable, as flavour trumps strength, until that inevitable wall is met, QED."
"A sipper, but with well hidden alcohol and no burn. A nice beer I will seek out to lay down and age for later."
"Gouden Carolus Cuvée Van De Keizer Blauw has a cloudy dark brown colour and a cream-coloured head that starts out about 5 mm thick and fades to excellent lacing (especially considering the ABV). The smell is very malty with a hint of toffee and alcohol. The taste is very sweet, dark and fruity. The finish is extremely smooth and sweet. There may be a hint of sourness there too. The texture is thick and slightly syrupy. This is a very nice and very strong Belgian. Yum."
"Medium bodied beer with ample soft carbonation that just keeps the tongue engaged in flavor. Lingering alcohol flavor on the tongue ensures that this is a bottle to share, and to savor slowly."
"D - This is good, but considering it's ranking and style, I expected to love it. Maybe this needs some age on it before I try another one."
"D: A very nice beer. This a beer for connoisseurs. I guess it will take me all night to slowly enjoy this one."
"D - Really enjoyable beer and one that I will definitely seek out again. The alcohol does make itself known as the bottle disappears. Overall a really great beer."
"Dark brown with a nice fluffly marshmellow light brown head. I could sit back and star at this beer the same way one admires a fine painting. Smells of maple(both the wood and syrup) and fresh pipe tobacco. Taste like raisin bread, plums, lot's of sugary sweet flavors. Overripe banannas and what sets this apart from others is the big bold grannysmith apple flavor. I love Grannysmith apples. Carbonation is spot on and the body is on the lighter side of full. This one is a sipper for sure but it's nice to just enjoy over the course of an evening. Great beer!!"
"D/N- So drinkable and flavorful. Lots of fruit flavors in this one. Excellent beer. Im going to buy some more for sure. Try this if you get a chance."
"Pours an attractive auburn color, cap of dense khaki colored head, good retention, mild lacing. Scent is of spiced apple cider opening into notes of plum, burnt sugar and alcohol as it warms. Taste begins with the spiced cider qualities, notes of plum and sugar more forward, touches of wood, vanilla and fresh bread and only a mild kick of alcohol. Great smooth creamy body and perfect level of moderate carbonation. A pleasure to drink slow as I enjoyed the bottle over 3 hours."
"D - Almost perfect. The flatness keeps it from getting a 5 on this one."
"Impression: For any lovers of this style- GET THIS. All others? GET THIS. Absolutely, stunningly delicious."
"D - Very tasty sipper! A little on the sweet side for my personal preference, but overall really nice and very enjoyable."
"D. Drinkable for sure. Hides ABV flawlessly. I have to say I find this one different in the flavor than many other BSDAs. I didn't get a lot of the dark fruit flavor in the taste as I was expecting. It was present in the aroma, but not the taste. A great beer nonetheless."
"Bought 750ml from Whole Foods and poured into a dimple glass. Poured a slightly hazy chestnut brown with a wispy head. The aroma was quite light, with subtle brandy/caramel notes. It somehow doesn't do justice to what comes next. A sip reveals a deliciously balanced sweetness of figs, melted brown sugar and nutmeg. My two-year old bottle may have softened out any bitterness, imparting a feather-light mouthfeel at the end. One of my favorite Belgian strong dark ales indeed!"
"I split a 750 ml bottle with a friend, poured into oversized wine glasses. The pour is a muddy plum color with a moderate white head, light lacing. The aroma is sweet, spicy and has a hint of bubblegum? The flavor is great, cotton candy, bubble gum, and dark fruit, with a lingering sweet finish. The beer is full/medium in body, average carbonation, and the alcohol is well hidden. The beer went down way too easy for such a big beer, highly recomended."
"This is a very nice sipper, a robust, warming sort of beer that's perfect on this snowy evening. It's a little hot and I'd like to try a vintage with a couple of years on it to see how it melds together and smooths out. I'm sure it's a real treat with a couple of years on it."
"Probably best to cellar for a year though I believe 2 years to be ideal. I have an '07 I plan to pop soon."
"Overall, the extreme malt bill and high ABV are so well-integrated that any warming present is easily mistakable for the spice of Belgian yeast. This is one of the most velvety smooth and crazy drinkable Belgian quadruple/dark ales I've had to date."
"This is a medium to full bodied brew with a modest amount of carbonation. The alcohol is very evident throughout the experience and it is quite drinkable. My only gripe is that this brew was a little too sweet for me to enjoy more than a single glass of. The bold combination of alcohol and sugar would present an interesting example for aging. I'd give it a try again if I could get an older bottle."
"(D)- A world class Belgain Strong Dark. Ripe full of jammy flavors. Easy on the palate and downright enjoyable to drink, but it definitely fills you up with how rich & sweet it is."
"Note: 2010 vintage"
"The Belgians really know what they are doing. This brew has a hefty percentage attached to it, but it drinks very very easily. It was pretty filling due to the sweetness."
"D: A great quad though the alcohol and cherry sweetness become a tad wearing"
"Drinkability: I enjoyed this for the style, I've passed this up a lot in the past, but that will change after I had this."
"D - Definitely a sipping beer with alcohol not masked at all. It dominates everything else. I would avoid this beer in the future."
"I probably wouldn't want to drink a whole bottle of this by myself, but due to the high alcohol content, that's not really an issue. I find this beer extremely delicious, and have loved it everytime I've had it."
"Not as good as the 15yo bottle of this I tried last year, but still a great beer."
"D: I wish I had more of this, it's such a great brew. Besides it's appearance, it's perfect."
"D- Very fine brew. Very strong flavor wise and booze wise, so it isn't the best session selection. I'd drink it again."
"If it had even a slightly dryer finish, I would gain a lot of weight from drinking it too often, and would up its drinkability score. I guess I need to try the 2010, and the 2009 again!"
"You must get yourself a few of these if like me, you love this type of complex brew."
"I had the 2009 vintage, Christmas 2010. It's not Christmas beer, but I think that it is. This beer feels like a mouth full of liquid velvet, thanks to the unctuousness of the liquid and its myriad tiny bubbles. Divine. The aroma is fruity, vinous. The taste is complex, definitely, banana, dates and figs. Only its cloying over-sweetness (excessive caramel?) lets it down. Great with Christmas cake, Christmas pudding, or to send you off to the land of nod when a day with the relatives has been just too exacting."
"D: nice sipping beer"
"Simply fabulous coupled with dark bitter chocolate (70% and a cru 100% cocoa) and an home made shortbread apple pie Recommended +++"
"Really enjoyable. Sipped for 30 or so minutes."
"Poured from a 750 (2009 batch) into a delirium snifter. Very light white head that does remain with a lot of legs. Smells uber fruity and tastes like the entire spectrum of fruit. There is a lot of alcohol present and it hits you fast. It may taste great but that booze catches up fast. I split a bottle but could have had it to myself but was careful. Great for the price. I recommend."
"Cheers!"
"This beer has a wonderful mouthful and is very flavorful. Nice soft carbonation up front with lots of peppery spice that is nicely balanced by a slight medicinal presence, dark fruit and alcohol warmth. Hints of chocolate, caramel, fig, raisin, date and dark cherry all bouncing off of each other. Incredibly complex with the perfect balance of roasty, spicy, sweet and heat. The high ABV is excellently masked however, making this beer dangerously drinkable. Highly recommended!"
"d - A very good Belgian dark ale. It smells really great and has a great mouthfeel. The smell and taste are very complex and enjoyable; I wish there was a little less alcohol in the taste but at 11% ABV what can you do. None the less a great beer I've had several times and will certainly have again."
"Excellent offering I feel fortunate to have had the opportunity to taste from the tap. It would definitely keep one warm & happy in the winter months."
"Pours a five+ finger pillowy, cream head that fades very slowly leaving a good lace. Deep cloudy amber/brown color. Nose is dark fruit and some alcohol. Good carbonation and medium bodied. Flavor is sweet dark fruit and hints of alcohol. $12.99 for a 750ml bottle from Beverage Warehouse Winooski, VT. Bottled 2008."
"Drinkability : a very nice beer in the style Belgian strong dark ale. To drink at cellar t°, you can taste it with chocolate ;-)"
"This was the 2004 vintage, enjoyed at Akkurat in Stockholm, Sweden. In company of great beers man stands small ..."
"Medium to full bodied and well carbonated. This beer is unbelievably smooth and easy to drink. The alcohol is noticeable, but not in the way at all. The mouthfeel on this beer is incredible. I need to buy several bottles of this to cellar."
"Really nice Belgian dark ale here. One of the best I've tasted."
"I could see serving this with a desert in small servings...."
"Overall this is a great beer. I am not a fan of very sweet beers but this is very well made and complex sweet beer. Though it is sweet it is complex and it is not one dimensional."
"has a full bodied mouthfeel with adequate carbonation; very drinkable for a beer this big. exceptional belgian strong dark ale."
"Verdict: Too expensive to be worth it, many better in the style can be found."
"D and Notes: What a great beer. I had high expectations coming into this one, and it definitely did not disappoint. The beer is just so flavorful and complex, but still somehow approachable and avoids being cloying. Incredible and I will definitely pick this one up again."
"drinkability is crazy good for a brew @ 11% abv - drinking this beer makes me happy to know that there are still plenty of beers still out there that will amaze me"
"D: Couldn't drink more than 5 ounces due to it's sweetness. Dessert beverage."
"This is among my favorite Belgian brews. My own preferences are for sweetness over dryness or hopiness, but with a reasonable balance. If your tendencies are in this direction try this one!"
"D: This is a sipper for dessert for sure. A solid brew all around."
"This was nice but i think it could use a nap in the cellar."
"Drinkability: Really good on your own or sharing with a friend. This beer deserves it's ranking (on BA) above many other BSDAs only behind 2 really great beers. This one is a natural with a nice, strong flavored cheese. A great one worth a try."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable, maybe too much so due to the high ABV. It was very easy to down this whole bottle pretty quickly because it goes down so easily and so flavorful."
"D - I wish I could have split this and shared the experience with someone who would enjoy it as much as I am but, the fact is, I can get this beer any day of the week! How awesome! For the percent and flavor perfection, I can't think of a more drinkable beer in this style. Better yet, I can't think of a better beer in this style period!"
"D- for 11 abv its masterfully used but not hot in any way. This is a great bsda."
"A brawny sort of Belgian dark strong ale. Assertive malt with moderately sweet dried dark fruit notes and sharp yeast flavors of banana and plum. Alcohol is evident and just a tad rough around the edges, but the beer is more than substantial enough to handle it. Very lively carbonation."
"A classic and superior example of the style - a great value and well suited to the cellar."
"Really an excellent beer. Hard to complain. Possibly not on the level of the best examples of the style, but just a slight step down. I'm sorry I ignored it for so long."
"D: Just an excellent beer - I just drank the 2009 version and this drinks amazingly easily for 11% abv. The alcohol is still abundantly present, but it adds as much to this beer as it has with anything else I've tried. Supremely well-blended and articulate. Instantly one of my favorite Belgians."
"Cheers!"
"Medium to full bodied, creamy, and overall a vibrant and crisp, flavorful beer; slightly tongue drying. The soft, creamy, coating mouth feel is just fantastic. Texturally this beer could not be improved. Despite high gravity, it is an amazingly easy beer to drink."
"Bottle, 2008 Vintage, second tasting. Dark brown with a thin white head and heavy lacing. Aroma is definately heavy on pears, carrots, caramelized sugar. Taste is fruity, pears, small fruits and alcohol. Good mouthfeel. It is an awesome dessert and ages beautifully.The sweetness can be cloying, you have to be in the mood."
"Bottle. Shared amongst several people who all wanted to try this highly rated beers. I don't drink too many Belgian Strong Ales so this is fairly new territory for me. Pours a dark reddish brown mahogany color with a tan head. Smells of sweet dark fruit and raisins. Boozy but smooth. Medium mouthfeel. Almost has ""legs"" like wine. Good but this would be tough to drink a lot of IMO."
"This was a very significant beer for me, I have already started contemplating it as the best beer I have had in 2010, and among the best I have ever had. I would easily recommend this as a game changing beer, but its exclusivity and high cost makes it more of a treat for celebrations."
"I could see this aging for quite some time, and mellowing beautifully. Still very good young."
"For a strong Belgian dark, I find this beer to be very drinkable. The heat makes me think it would be better to consume it during the cooler months. I'll finish this 750ml, but it is certainly worth sharing if you think you may not like it (or want to consume that much strong beer at once)."
"Mouth feel is carbonated and creamy, but somehow a little watery. Alcohol is strong but still drinkable. A very fine beer. Two years of aging did not hurt this one. It still tasted fresh and great. One of the best I have had."
"Notes: This was a great beer, but I think would have been better shared with someone else. A little challenging to kill a whole 750 by myself."
"A beautiful looking beer with a tan cottony head. Smells wonderful and sweet. But the pleasure ends there. The taste starts lively and fresh but quickly goes way too sweet for me. Can't taste anything but malt, sugar and alcohol. Thick and syrupy mouthfeel. I would rather have a coke but it may just be a style preference. Sorry."
"Notes: Vintage 2009. Great beer that is very complex and has a lot of bold, big flavors. Inclusion of licorice and bubblegum flavor is interesting for the style. I really liked the beer, like I said before, some may think it is a bit too sweet, but it makes a great dessert or night caper (although I could see me drinking this other times too!)."
"D: Big beer. Complex. Definitely a sipper."
"One of my all-time favorites. The traditional BSDA characteristics are enhanced by a larger than usual presence of rich malts. A prime candidate for cellaring, especially since they bumped up the abv % from 9, and a prime candidate for a special day, or to make a regular day special. Also, only $10 for this?! Crazy good deal, considering all of the $15 and $20 beers who should bow their heads in reverence to this gem."
"Drinkability - this beer is IMO stunning. One bomber is absolutely enough for one person but Had I access I would definitely buy a case. This beer is truly orgasmic :)"
"Notes: First Carolus I have had, and as a slow brew with a broad range it is rather pleasing. A bit overpriced on this draft import serving, but that aside the experience was well worth it."
"DB- Great price for such an amazing vintage. Love the taste and balance, age has really improved this ale. Hard to explain the flavors at one point but I know one beer that I will age for 3.25 years."
"According to the label this ages very well, but I'd like to try it fresh. A little more carbonation would've done well here, this was nearly flat. Booze is there but held back and has a nice warming quality."
"Poured into a large tulip glass. 2009 bottle consumed 7/10. Head was respectable but brief. Color, on the other hand, impressed. A wonderful deep red. Smell of fresh cut sour apples, brown sugar. Slight hop bitterness on first contact with the tongue is quickly pushed aside by a wonderful sweetness, apples, cherries maybe? Almost more of a carbonated red wine. Complex taste that changes dramatically from sip to sip as the beverage warms. Nicely carbonated. Thickens as it warms as well. Alcohol is present but subtle for the 11%. A superb beer all around, a real pleasure to drink and savor. Will buy a few to cellar."
"D: definitely a sipper, tough to finish."
"D - This is a big time offering... Enjoyable all the way around... Memorable... A stellar BSDA that is bursting with complexity... Sophisticated and worldly... A sipper that is terrific to relax with..."
"Overall, a very well done BSDA. Lots of good flavors. A sipper at such a big beer, but I do like it. Fairly drinkable. This is a beer that you need to be in the mood for big time."
"Exceptional."
"Seems well carbonated with just a nice slightly syrupy coating in the mouth. It is a very flavorful beer, and I'm glad I tried it but not sure I'd seek it out again - the funky taste and alcohol flavors that come through just don't really float my boat."
"I'll likely buy another one of these bombers (and open it in the shower) to see if my opinion changes after attempting to avoid an eruption. I will update this post When I do. Despite the overflow, this beer is intriguing, but too sweet to drink repeatedly."
"Overall: What a beer! I tried it to soon, it has a lot of potential. I couldn't stop myself from trying it and it was still delicious. It has a lot going on and is as complex as some great wines."
"D - Not an especially easy drinker. All of the flavors are on the intense side, alcohol is noticeable, diacetyl is high and a bit distracting (but I am especially sensitive to diacetyl). Came in really wanting to like this beer, I do - but not nearly as much as I wanted to."
"D= Great beer. I would drink this again in a heartbeat. Worth every sip. A little different but what you want in a good Belgian. Worth seekng out."
"2009 bottle. pours a dark amber color with good to large off white head and lacing. lively fizzy carbonation. sweet raisin like smell, taste is the same with hints of carmel, and molasses. very sweet with a slight bitter finish. medium body, thin oily texture, and average flavor duration. very good brew. alcohol is fairly well hidden but creeps up on you fast."
"D- I'm really hoping that this was a bad bottle. The buttered biscuit is quite overwhelming and masks the more complex components of the brew. I am willing to give this another try-but couldn't finish it this time- luckily this was shared amongst a few of us do it didn't go to waste. Side note- I don't like their tripel either..."
"D-seems to be a bit of a mess and shows a good bit of alcohol in the back. also has a fair amount of diacetyl. must need age or something imo."
"750ml corked and caged bottle. 2007 vintage served at 53 degrees in my Gouden Carolus chalice. Poured a hazy mahogany with a half inch, loose, off-white head that quickly dissipated into a broken skim and a band that coalesced around the shoulders. Nose is vinous, with lots of dark fruit (figs and plums) and a slightly caustic alcohol nose that somewhat drowns out the other characteristics. Taste follows nose, but there's also a hint of chocolate in the mix, as well as an artificial sweetener quality, toffee and a buttery character. Mouthfeel is medium-light with a smooth, even carbonation. I've been looking forward to trying this one for a while, but I have to say that I was a little let down. The alcohol is a little too forward and it definitely crosses the line between complex brew and muddled mess. Probably my least favorite offering from this brewery."
"Mouthfeel is on the heavier side and carbonation is low. Drinkability is very good, the malt flavors are delicious. This is usually one of my least favorite styles but when done so well as this I really enjoy them. I love the big malty and fruity flavors this one had. One of the best of the style I've tried for sure."
"3.5 D: Good brew, but the carbonation is too high and the brew itself is a bit too boozy for this to be very drinkable. I bet this ages well."
"Brewed on: Feb. 24, 2009 (bottled 14 months ago)"
"D: Very drinkable Abbey Ale, one of these large bottles is great to split with one other, or have alone if you feel like getting a good buzz while enjoying a refreshing sweet beer"
"There isn't much I can verbalize to set this apart from other top notch Belgian strong dark ales. I guess I'll just say that it delivers on the promise of its style, and its unique character is (like most beers) easier to appreciate by drinking than by reading about it. It's a solid representation of the style; not the exemplar, but possessing a delicious flavor and no flaws in the aroma, taste, or feel to note."
"Pours darker than expected. Maple syrup sort of color. Big head on it but disappears. No lacing to speak of. Aroma of plum and dark fruit. Flavor also has the plum or prune flavors. Dark candi sugar comes out after fruit subsides. Thin body. Sweetness grows as it warms. Starts a little sour. 2007 vintage has aged nicely, but its on the verge of cloying."
"Note: I have a few various ages of this beer now and it tends to develop a very nice sipping spicy, boozy fruit quality right around the 2 year old mark which seems to be the best IMO."
"D- This is a big, strong beer. I can enjoy this glass by myself very easily. The entire 750ml is another story."
"D: Excellent. I wouldn't even know it was 8% ABV, let alone 11%!"
"At 11%, you likely won't be drinking much of this beer, but you sure as heck will savor and enjoy it. Positively great BSDA."
"Highly recommended."
"4/4/3.5"
"Overall, probably the best result I have ever had from aging. This beer is just phenomenal. Tons of layer and depth, yet balanced and cohesive. Really wishing I had another bottle in my cellar."
"Overall a great beer. I'm glad I picked it up and will definitely buy it again."
"I love it. Great beer, I'll be annually seeking this out - or having others buy it for me and sending it to me."
"Note: I've had the bottled version from 2009 as well which was not nearly as impressive. This brew improves SIGNIFICANTLY with age. Draft might be important as well."
"Pretty high on the drinkability for the ABV (11%). Nice balance of sweet and tangy, I like this quite a bit. Top 100 worthy, maybe, maybe not. Probably so, just quite a bit different than what I was expecting."
"Verdict: While I'm a little disappointed that it didn't quite live up to the hype I've seen, Cuvée Van De Keizer is still a solid, complex, and thoroughly drinkable Belgian Strong Dark Ale well worth a try."
"Overall, this beer is a winner and is most definitely a world class BSDA. Rich and complex, yet easy drinking for the ABV. Right up there in the conversation with any top Belgian beer you can name."
"Overall a nice Belgian Dark."
"Strong Dark is not my favorite Belgian style but this is pretty good considering. Very strong in flavor, a little lighter than expected in color, more coffee than chocolate, great carbonation, decent aroma. I'm looking forward to trying some of their other varieties."
"D - Well, it's great if you have enough, hehe."
"M - Waterier than I expected. Mouthfeel usually isn't a huge issue for me but this detracts just a bit from the overall quality."
"D - I'd held high hopes here and the beer showed initial promise. Let down by its complete imbalance. Might revisit with a fresher bottle, but can't imagine the overpowering sweetness being brought into check."
"D: Not as complex as some other Strong Dark Belgian ales, (Chimay Grand Reserve) but still amazingly drinkable. I think the first time I had this, I thought it was going to be a golden ale, and was disappointed to find it was a dark ale. This second time around, knowing what I was getting, I've appreciated this that much more. Excellent interpretation of the style, and quite possibly one of the top ten in the style. Wine drinkers, or those who do not like excessively hoppy or bitter brews, could appreciate this one."
"Once poured in my goblet ""Gouden Carolus"". Look: Purplish brown, thin foamy head with a thick finger, seems ice cream, very good lacing; Smell: Roasted malt, coffee, purple grapes and figs; Taste: Similar, roasted malt, coffee, purple grapes and sugar, few traces of alcohol without being disagreeable, grapes prevails over the other ingredients; Mouthfeel: Clean, very bitter with sweet moments, extra thick body, creamy and robust; Drinkability: Like drinking wine-beer, very good, combining the warmth of the wine with the freshness of beer."
"Seriously, if you like liquor you may like this way better than the bottle version, my wife did. I don't like a beer that tastes too much like liquor and use the descriptor ""unbalanced"" to describe it. Both flavor and drinkability suffer."
"Love the beer, love the bottle -- GC can do no wrong."
"Poured a deep reddish brown color with great caronation.Nose is rich caramel, dried dark fruits and candy. Taste is caramel, sweetness, dark fruits, booze and candy. Mouthfeel is booze, sticky, sweet and dark fruits. This is a big, rich beer and it is very good."
"The mouthfeel is pleasing. The soft smooth texture is complimented by a peppery spice, slight sizzle of carbonation and healthy warmth of ABV. Quite drinkable. Good thing it was a $10 bottle or I would have bought them all and drank to a problem because it's so easy and good. Great find."
"Sweet, and I mean very sweet, malts mingle with an uber-heavy Belgian yeast bread and fruit ester profile. Very crazy beer, even a bit sour. Residual sugars are high, but there is a nice alcohol and grape-esque clensing of the palate. It is kind of like a quad, shall we say quasi-quad? ABV is fairly well hidden but still noticeable. I think a few more years on this would be a good idea and plan on aging the other 2 bottles I have for a while. Could use some more melding of the flavors."
"Overall, this beer is excellent. I would consider this best session beer ever because of its drinkability, and with abv it'll get your cracked twice as quick."
"D Only fair. This is a huge beer with a robust 10.0% ABV and so I cannot report that it is particularly drinkable. This is an apertif beer meant to be savored and enjoyed. I plan on doing just that after typing these words. 3.0"
"High degree of drinkability. Excellent carbonation and balance of dried fruits, some initial sweetness on the front palate with a crisp finish at the back. The high gravity is masked by the complexity of this beer."
"Very rich and delicious beer overall. Glad to finally try this one."
"One of the more interesting and challenging Belgian ales I've tasted."
"... and with the last words written, it is 12:03 AM! Happy New Year, 2010, and prost!"
"I have been meaning to try this for a few years and finally got around to picking up a bottle. Pours a deep, dark clear mahogany with a thick, dense tan head that appears to have an imaginary slight pinkish hue. Glass is coated sticky lacing and overall has nice retention but eventually fades a large bubbly cap. At cooler temperatures the aroma is rich with dark fruits, yeast, sugars, etc and is very pleasant but as it warms up the alcohol dominates and detracts from the nose. The mouthfeel is my favorite part of this beer. Medium full, silky with light carbonation and a rich, sweet fruity finish. Like the nose, the flavors become dominated by alcohol as this beer warms up. Even when cold, flavors are dominated by ripe, dark fruits, sugars, caramel malt, light spices, occasionally tart and all of these flavors are intensified as it warms up. Overall, an amazing Belgian, probably should have let this sit a little longer and a little too sweet for my own personal tastes, but the amazing mouthfeel and carbonation nearly makes up for those points."
"Just heavenly, dangerously alcoholic, filling, great looking, what more can I say. I love it."
"i tried it once and for some reason, i don't think i liked it (or it was another beer from gouden carolus im confusing this one with), but having re-tasted it i can say this beer is awesome. i wanna cellar a bottle."
"2006 Bottle Rating: 4.5, 4, 4.5, 4.5, 4"
"Fabulous stuff. If you don't like this, then you probably don't like beer. Yummm...."
"Funny contrasts (see flavor notes) that ultimately leaves me wanting more (even with the richness). So many flavors appear. Each drink is a new experience. This leads to higher drinkability. Sweet enough to use as syrup on ice cream. Lives up to its ranking. Even my youngest chillin' could tell this was an exceptional beer."
"D - I am happy this is in 750 ml and not just 12 oz. I could drink a bottle of this in a night and be quite satisfied."
"D) A tad too sweet for me"
"Certainly one of the better Belgian Strong Dark Ales I've come across, and more complex and balanced than many of its compatriots. Only a slightly mediocre appearance lets things down, but that aside this is a phenomenal brew, and one of the best from an excellent brewery."
"Perhaps not as rich or complex as a few other examples I've tried but those few would be hard pressed to match the smooth drinkability of this one - well put together, everything blends seamlessly."
"Very easy sipper. A good way to end a chilly sunday evening."
"Cuvée Van De Keizer is only brewed on one day a year, February 24th. I don't see much need to brew it more often than that. It seems to be in fairly wide distribution and, although it is, in all respects, a very good beer I would consider the other Gouden Carolus offerings to be great beers. Keep in mind, however, as the high score posted above shows, that even this brewery's ""good"" beer ranks above the average brewery's best."
"A really solid, loveable Belgian. A pleasure, too bad it's the last one of these at my local store."
"All in all, a complex, balanced and tasty beer. Due to the sweetness, it gets quite demanding after a while."
"This is a keeper! One to sip & enjoy & hope it never ends."
"The Kings Of Hop"
"Overall: Great beer, love it. Also had 5 or more year old vintages several times, and I can tell you, it is even better than the fresh one! Highly recommendable."
"drink this beer whenever you get the chance, it is worth looking for if not available at your local beer store. I'm so pleased with this beer I'm wondering if it's worth aging"
"Would be great with Thanksgiving food, say Pumpkin pie and turkey."
"Na Zdravje!"
"2008 vintage. This poured a dark clear ruby with moderate tan head. It smelled like chocolate covered cherries and rich plumb and brown sugar, with some bready yeast and maple syrup and subtle spices. It tasted like chocolate covered cherries and plumbs and brown sugar, with some candied oranges and a bit of sour yeast and spices. It was thick with smooth carbonation, and had a bittersweet aftertaste. Overall this was a super rich and sweet and delicious beer. It had fantastic flavor that was complex but clean, and hid the alcohol all too well. The body was fantastic too, making it fairly easy to drink, but the richness made it much more of a sipping beer. As with the red labeled Van De Keizer, I would love to try it fresh, and also see how it tastes after a lot more years. Regardless, I'm pretty sure this one is amazing at any age."
"One of those beers you can can sit down with and really inspect the rainbow of flavors. It is a bit sweet for me, but that said, an incredible beer. The interesting mix of flavors could best be described as the love child of a Belgian Quad and a German Hefe."
"D: Drinkable, but not very high drinkability to me. Much too light, though the ABV is well hidden."
"A very tasty beer, but one I think needs to be treated with a lot of respect. Very much a sipper, and a good one to warm you on a chilly night. Very much a winter beer, I wouldn't want this on a hot night, but on a cool night, it will warm you in a very pleasant way."
"750 ml caged and corked bottle from 2007. Served in a chalice, the beer pours a hazy dark brown/mahogany color with a very thin tan head that went away quickly. Not much lacing at all. The aroma is mostly dark fruit (raisins, plums, cherries), along with some molasses, banana and Belgian yeast. Taste is similar to the aroma, but there's also some booze and licorice noticable. But like the aroma, the dark fruit taste is the strongest compared to the other flavors. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit creamy and coating and has moderate carbonation. Drinkability is good, it's easy to drink and goes down smooth. However, this one is a sipper because of the 11% ABV. I think this is a good overall brew, I'd buy it again in the future."
"D: Quite drinkable. Split this one with my wife and glad that we had a whole 750 to split."
"I say drink Cuvee Van De Keizer fresh. It's really not worth your patience waiting for it to age."
"Great beer and a real treat late at night."
"Tried the large format bottle poured into my favorite snifter. Pour a dark brown almost mahogany color with a course tan full head. The head had good retention but ended with little lacing. The smells at first hinted of yeast and some dark full fruit perhaps blackberries with a strong sweet edge. The taste was full with hints of caramel, dates, apricot and plum. The carbonation was low but appropriate for the style. The bottle I enjoyed was a 2008 and could stand up to another year or so of aging. Overall this was a good beer and I would try it again soon."
"Vintage 2007 drank 9/11/9. Cork pops off nicely and aromas of dark fruit and yeast fill the air. Pouring brings out some sweet carmalized malt and bannana. Pours brownish-red with a head that dissipates fast to an off white lace around the glass. Flavor is sweet, there is some bannana that hits you up front and a nice caramel and fig finish. A little alcohol burn in the finish but not too bad for a big beer. Mouthfeel is oily with low carbonation. Overall this brew hits you with strong fruit flavors and a shot of alcohol in the finish. This brew had 2 years on it, I think it can go easily 2-4 more years possibly up to 10 years."
"A well-crafted Belgian Strong Ale overall."
"D: Despite its 11% ABV it doesn't seem ""hot"" to me. Very nice to drink start to finish."
"Awesome ale, I wish I had purchased more than just the one 750 ml bottle."
"This is a very good beer that I am happy I could get the opportunity to try. Appearance is thick like velvet with a dark brown hue and slight head. Smell and taste are fairly similar, however the complexities of the beer are just more overwhelmingly apparent in the taste. Brown sugar, milk chocolate are the dominating flavors up front. Very sweet but not overpoweringly so. Lots of dark fruit esters make the slight boozy taste fade away at the end. Very complex and delicious. Mouthfeel is thick and velvety, amazing. Drinkability is so good, expecially given the alchohol content."
"A very well done ale!"
"Overall Impression - Wonderful beer! My favorite beer, in fact. This is a review of the 2008 vintage. I love every aspect of this beer. I encourage everyone who can get this beer to go buy it immediately. What more can I say?"
"Drinkability is ok not great but not really bad either."
"D= Good complexity here and despite the ABV, this never really feels too hot. Nicely done!"
"Every year on the 24th of February Gouden Carolus brews the Cuvee de Keizer Blauw, or ""Grand Cru of the Emperor"" to celebrate the birthday of Charles V. The Cuvee de Keizer is brewed uniquely with only fine Belgium hops and with it being 11% ALC/VOL. this beer will age extremely well over the next several years with a complexity and intensity usually reserved for only the finest wines. This beer pours with a deep caramel color and golden tan head with aromas plums, raisins and wood leaping out of the glass. The palate starts of with sweet caramel that soon gives way to fruity flavors of figs and plums with a slight tart quality. The finish is long and mouth filling as the Belgium hops flex their muscles making it both sweet and bitter at the same time. It is still a little young so if you can keep your hands off of it the 2008 Cuvee de Keizer will only continue to develop over the next couple of years. What a treat!"
"Like a fine port this seems like it would get better with age. Go slow with this one and savor every last drop."
"Banana and spice on the tongue, with tart sweetness of cherry and plum and roundness of fig and oats. Finish is sweet and tart with a pourous balance and barely-noticeable 11% ABV. Flows smooth from front to back."
"I haven't had the classic Gouden Carolus in a long time, long before I started reviewing, so I cant compare to that. I can say its about as good a BSDA as I've had, and its hard to imagine much improvement."
"An amazing piece of beer craftsmanship, and one of the best beers I've had in months. Every part blends together perfectly, each component delectable, but it's the beer as a whole that's truly wonderful."
"One of my favorite beers, had it on tap a month ago and thought it was excellent then as well, a definite must whenever you see it!"
"Fantastic all around beer. I think this one would age very well."
"(2008 bottling) Simple, presentable one finger of light brown micro-foam, more lacing than expected, very credible. Offers a red-brown base color with an orange tinge, you can easily see the steady streams of bubbles which reinvigorate the head. The sweetness in the nose is consistent and stays within bounds, mix of poached apricots, maraschino cherry, golden raisins, caramelized brown sugar, glazed nuts and cinnamon stick, looks more for balance and follow-through than any one big thrust. Full-bodied, there's a broad, creamy foaminess to support the concentration and prevent heaviness. Here the caramel, molasses, brown sugar leads clearly into the cherry, apricot, peach, pear fruit, less emphasis on raisin or fig. At times you get banana notes. Serves up nutmeg, cinnamon spice with a hint of clove. Some licorice too. Retains that creamy texture to extend the finish. Even with its relatively high density easy to quaff."
"Drinkability overall is excellent a brew that you should share with friends or indulge in alone if your feeling up to a big brew like this. Great complexity and flavor brings you back for another sip again and again, quite dangerous."
"Too strong and too sweet to be terribly drinkable to me, but still a good beer. Maybe it need to breathe or warm up a little, or maybe it needed to spend some time in the cellar, I'm not sure."
"D: This is a wonderful beer. A bit to rich to be more than a slow sipper. Can't wait to get this beer again every year."
"My first thought is: ""Holy shit, this is 11%??"" Needless to say, the alcohol is well-hidden, except for a tiny evaporative heat on the back of the palate. Rich, creamy malts coat the front and sides of the tongue, while the yeast adds fruity esters of raisin rum and currant. Body is thick, but doesn't weigh heavily upon the palate, thanks in part to an uppity carbonation level that blends well with the spiciness. A sipper? Certainly, but less ""laborious"" than most other 10%+ Belgian bigs. Quite drinkable, in fact. Glad I have the rest of the bomber to keep me company."
"This is a tricky brew. Light, but sweet, coating, and filling. The alcohol and sweetness make it interesting for a glass, but wearying after that."
"An odd Belgian. Tasty, but different."
"Corked bottle labeled 2008: This brew is a stark black color with crimson highlights if held to a strong light source. The head is thick, tan, and long lasting. What a smell! Incredible fruit smell...prunes and molasses, peaches, cherry, pear. All of the fruit smells are very ripe and vivid...it's almost like fruit on the verge of decaying. The smell is intense, and backed with just a shade of alcohol. The brew's taste is sweet and malty, with lots of raisin and chocolate (think good milk chocolate). The beer is very thick...thick and almost sticky-sweet. Mouthcoating. The flavors are so strong that they obscure the alcohol, which creeps up on you. Great beer!"
"75cl, 2008 vintage bottle split with LarryLSB at Brasserie Beck. Dark caramel brow color with a lasting beige head of fine bubbles. Vinous, yeasty, and fruity aroma with dates and cherry. The flavor is sweet, yet well balanced, with complex yeast, brown sugar, and dried fruit flavors of dates and prune. Medium-full is body with lively carbonation that lets it glide over your tongue. This was outstanding with chocolate mousse for dessert. Wonderful on its own, but the pairing was truly sublime. I was looking forward to this, and it more than delivered."
"An excellent version of a Belgian Strong Ale because it's not overwhelming for those not ready for this style and easy to drink. At 11%, could not tell the alcohol content at all. Nice balance, good notes of prunes and candy sugar. Not the absolute best, but worthwhile. One of the cooler bottles as well."
"Sometimes it's too sweet to be sessionable, but very drinkable."
"Poured a light brown cloudy caramel color. Very thick with two fingers of head. For being 11% I taste no alcohol at all. I love the initial taste, but the thick caramel taste follows and stays on the tongue for an extended period of time. Pleasant to drink. More of a dessert beer, or something I'd drink with food than a beer I'd just kick back with. Fortunately doesn't get any worse as it warms up a little because there was no way I was going to finish this quickly. A solid buy but there are better belgians out there."
"Poured 2008 bottle into a Duvel glass. Appearence of dark reddish brown with a rather quickly dissipating head. Aromas of mostly raisins and dates with light brown sugar. Quite sweet in the taste. Tastes of mostly raisins and brown sugar. Has a long sweet finish that lingers for a while (the best aspect of the beer). I think this beer will pair well with Creme Brulee. I couldnt have more than one glass in a sitting. Not bad."
"Overall, not a bad brew, but definitely not worthy to be put among giants like Chimay Blue or Rochefort 8. Its average rating of 4.3 is way to much."
"D: Decent. I feel there are other Belgian and Belgian-style ales available in this flavor profile for a cheaper price and more regular attainability. I don't doubt the quality of this beer but I don't think it's worth waiting a year for. Also, despite proper hydration and eating with this beer, I had a headache the next morning -- and it was the only thing I drank. I blame the fusel, but who knows..."
"D - Just about as drinkable as you can get for an 11% Belgian very good taste that I enjoyed a lot worth trying"
"I had this exquisite pour from the taps of TJ's Everyday in Paoli,PA. Deep reddish pour that left light lacing. Nose of dark fruits, alcohol...and various spices I couldn't individually identify. Taste of sweet malts, sugar, fruits...this Belgian Dark is caramel deep and rich in flavour! I like this brew so much, I bought a bomber, and will savor it soon!!!"
"Poured into Duvel Tulip. Deep, dark ruby in color with a massive and rocky off-white head. Amazing retention and lacing. Smell was instantly of dark fruits, alcohol, yeast, and bread...pretty much what I'd expected. Taste was really strong of cherry, raisin, pear, and grape with a sweet malty undertone. A warming alcohol burn as it goes down the back of the throat. Really nice taste but at first it was not what I expected. Carbonation was slightly high with a thicker, smooth mouthfeel. Overall a great beer, the ABV will kick ya in the pants but sip it slowly and enjoy."
"D: I really liked this beer. It's a perfect sipping beer to share with friends. Definitely worth the price of entry."
"very good, but i'm interested in seeing how this ages."
"D: I don't know what happened. When I had this back in December, I liked it a lot. This time around, it was way too sickeningly spicy and sweet and I had to do a drain pour. Maybe I got a bad bottle."
"On the sweet side, lingering impression on the palate is very sweet malt. Also got something funky going on that's hard for me to pinpoint, either it's licorice, or something similar. Sweet malt and candied sugar, raisiny, very lightly hopped. A very rich, thick beer with those layers of complexity that you love to feel. A bit spicy at the end. Chewy, yet super smooth, and it just loves to roll off the tongue. Pretty high carbonation for the style. Drinkability is high because of the above, but I also think it's a bit boozey, and that detracts a bit. It's been a great sipper for me tonight, where normally I would be all over something like this. Still very worthy, though."
"At 11% I dount youd be knocking many of these back, but the mouthfeel is quite light for something that appears so dark!"
"Notes: Damn, this is fantastic! I love BSDA's, but this one really stands out to me. Deeply complex with some great dark fruity flavors atop a huge malt bill that I just love. Throw in some nice spiciness and you've got probably the best Belgian Strong Dark Ale that I've had to date! Highly recommended"
"I poured this (newer label) 2008 beer into a Chimay goblet. It looked enticing, but the aroma wasn't very good. As I inhaled, I detected some phenols that weren't pleasant. Upon the first sip, the funky phenols came into play. Now, the funkiness wasn't like a Lambic or red/brown Flanders ale with a ""good"" funkiness. This funkiness wasn't acerbic, but it was a bad funkiness that rested lightly in the background of the more dominant candy sweetness of this brew. The bad characteristics reminded me of a mix of: hints of Testors Glue, some sweaty neoprene, perhaps some ""new tire", and/or wisps of unwanted phenols (like when some American breweries let a German weizen yeast get totally out of control). All of this is then wrapped up in a dominating sugary sweet glaze. Sound appetizing? It wasn't, and I ended up doing a drain-pour. I've had this one on a couple of occasions in the past and thought I remembered it being pretty good, but this latest bottle has discouraged me from buying this brew again. I know sometimes a person's tastes and preferences change, but I don't see how they could have changed *that* much with me and this brew. I don't know...maybe this is a brew that just needs lots of aging before it becomes drinkable, and I've only had aged versions in the past? Now that I think about it, I've had some brews with perfectly ""good"" phenolics which were aged, and those characteristics sadly disappeared. I think this is a brew which needs some age so that the ""bad"" phenols will disappear. I bet that's why I liked the aged versions of this brew I had in the past. Whatever the case, and whatever vintage you might find of this brew, hopefully you'll like it...and I still have hope that it can be a good brew."
"I have several of these in bottles from vintage 2004-2008. It seems to be growing. It certainly is one of them keeper beers."
" -Dotson"
"I really don't see what all the buzz is about with this beer. Had the 2008 version. It was way too sweet with a super thick mouthfeel. I can't put my finger on it but I think it is the huge amount of Belgian esters combined with a ton of candy sugar and malts. I think it's too much and I drain poured."
"It's been aging since 2002, so don't expect the more beer-ey tones to be present, but my God, the flavors are incredibly sweet and powerful, yet smooth. No yeasty alcoholic taste, just pure fruity goodness. Retains all of its alcoholic properties, as my rapidly progressing inebriation can attest to. Very enjoyable, and not because it's less attainable. Get thee to Lucky Baldwin's for this aged version, the unaged, and what is presently three or four other Gouden Carolus beers. Nummy num."
"D - Very drinkable. Almost scary as it's 11%. Beware the sweetness and just keep in mind that it packs a punch."
"D - Very big in every way. Would tire."
"I've sampled this beer a few times over the years and have thoroughly enjoyed every bottle I've come across. This year-plus old bottle is outstanding just like the others. This truly is a classic and one of the best in its loose fitting style."
"2007 version 3/14 @ Armsby Abbey. Pours dark caramel brown with minimal white lacing. Aroma of molasses, caramel, and candied sugar. Delicious flavor. Sweet malts and caramel descend into a candies sugar, yeasty finish. Very sweet, but not overly so. Thick mouthfeel with minimal carbonation. Super delicious beer."
"Wine Specialist/$9.99/750 ml"
"No real head that last any amount of time, dark brown body. Nose, banana bread, alcohol, hypothesizing smell as it warms. yum. Alcohol comes out more as it warms up. Taste, great, some cherry licorice in there, banana. Mouthfeel is nice, carbonation great. Drinkability is supurb. I'm really diggin this one but I'm a Belgian nerd. Highly recommended."
"Could go down smoother. A bit crisp from heavy carbonation. Still relatively creamy and thick. Medium to full bodied. Great drinkability."
"A very good experience. I will buy more."
"This is a great beer. A beer to savor every drop of. Highly recommended, and something for the cold winter months."
"Overall, a rather good BSDA that I really enjoyed. Highly recommend as it's a great example for the style. For me, one is enough unless the circumstances were just right."
"D - Drinkability is good. This is a very well rounded Belgian ale. The only real flaw is a light over carbonation. All other aspects of this brew are very nice. The 11% stays out of the way and only adds a nice subtle heat throughout. Het Anker has something special with the Cuvée Van De Keizer. Highly recommended."
"The taste is full of thick, rich, raisen and date like malts. Slight peaty roastyness. There's a nice sharp alcohol plus hops finish. A great beer that I highly recommend. Not very drinkable to the average drinker but a must have for belgian and strong ale fans!!!!"
"Poured a medium mahogany color with an insubstantial light tan head, though it did retain some nice lacing. Initially smelled of figs and currants though later I detected a woody scent. Easy to drink with little to no alcohol detected despite the advertised 11% abv. Taste was on the thin side -- not a lot of complexity while in the mouth or after swallowing. Easy on the pallet but harder on the wallet."
"Another excellent beer to add to my list of great Belgian strong dark ales! Despite being a tad more expensive than other similar beers (Chimay Blue, etc.) this is definitely worth trying for the couple extra bucks. I'll definitely get this again the future."
"Poured a deeper and cloudy/muddy brownish color wih virtually no head. Aromas of dark fruits (prunes and raisins) and fruity. Tastes of the same dark fruitiness (plums and raisins), caramel, toffee, and some lighter spiciness. All around on the sweeter side. Lighter alcohol in the finish."
"D- 11%, you kidding me. A night time beer for sure. The 9oz serving I had was a good size portion for a beer this complex. I would never think of drinking a whole bottle to myself, even though i would like to try a bottle to compare. I was not impressed with Het Ankers Noel offering but this restored my faith in this brewery."
"I probably would have gone a 4, but my two companions let me finish the last third or so. Big and sweet. Methinks it would age well. I'd have it again."
"Pours a dark ruby reddish-brown with a light brown head. Aromas of caramelized raisins, cherries, licorice, and alcohol. A lot of the same flavors with a touch of smoke and heavier on the cherry. Full body with lots of carbonaton. Semi sweet finish. This is pretty damn yummy."
"The Goulden Carolus Cuvee van de keizer is an outstanding Belgian Strong Dark Ale. It is a silky and smooth sipping beer with a very refined taste and aroma. I had the pleasure of pairing a 2007 vintage bottle with a Gurkha Centurian Perfecto cigar and the combination was superb. Liquid dessert!"
"Drinkablility- This is a rare treat. Seek out if you are at all into quads."
"Still quite sweet after four years, and the carbonation is low. Otherwise a world-class Strong Dark or Quad."
"Easily one I could ssip all night long. Very tasty and very drinkable!"
"This beer pours a dark brown with a light tan head and some lacing. The smell is big of malt and chocolate. The taste is very big and well constructed, flavors of choclate, malt and soime fruity flavors. The mouthfeel is nice, a slight dry aftertaste. A highly drinkable brew for 11%"
"This brew has risen towards the the top in my list of favorites. One of the great Belgians. On the sweeter side of the style, but only by a shade. Great taste and full body. ABV very well hidden. So much better than the GC classic, so don't confuse the two. Once you get past Westy and Rochefort (which we can't get anymore anyways), and possibly St. Bernardus 12 - this is as good as any other Belgian as far as I'm concerned."
"Mouth: Flavors of dark caramel, cocoa, pumpernickel, tobacco, banana pith, honey, bubblegum, cherry, dates, peanut skins, and alcohol. Nice complexity but still too hot. Carbonation is obtrusively high; some swirling and time is needed before I can comfortably sip this beer. Dry warming finish."
"drinkability: very drinkable beer, especially on a cold winters day. Perfect call in sick and drink all day beer in the winter."
"The pour yields little head -- just some froth that quickly dissolves. The color is very dark brown, sort of burgundy at the edges. The smell is heavy on the alcohol, with notes of apricot and leather. The taste is sweet up front, almost maple-syrup in intensity, with hints of dried fruit; the middle is dominated by rich malt and yeast, with a sharp alcoholic finish and a lingering aftertaste of grain. It's very mildly carbonated -- I could be convinced it had come out of a cask, almost -- much thinner than I'd expected, which is to say that it is full-bodied without being overly meaty. It's easy to drink, despite the considerable alcohol burn, but this is for sure a sipper. I'm going to hold onto my other bottles for a couple of more years and see if they mellow."
"I would recommend this beer. SurlySober brought this over to my house for a tasting with Flyer. We had Beatification, Allagash Black, Westvleteren 8 and Westvleteren 12 before this beer, so maybe it was just upstaged and I might have thought it exceptional on any other night."
"D - Pretty enjoyable and easy to drink but to strong to session"
"Drinkability - I think someone before said ""scary."" Definitely. Delicious, alcohol flavor is disguised but abv is high so beware."
"D- As mentioned in the description of the taste, this one is pretty drinkable considering the high ABV but it will eventually catch up to you as the bottle gets a little emptier. This review is based on a fresh bottle, things should get even better with some age. Highly Recommended!"
"All in all a good BSD but the lumpy appearance and overly sweet flavor hinder this one."
"notes: This is a very different strong belgian ale, shares little in comparison with a traditional SBA like any of the Chimay's. This is one that I will come back to again. Age helps this brew achieve an amazing flavor."
"A great beer that is strong yet not hot."
"Finish is on the sweeter side and alcohol is disguised."
"Beautiful head with great lasting power and lasting. Opaque brown/dark brown in a clear way (not muddy but you can't see through it). Smells like candi sugar - cooking gently on the stove. Rich, dark, sweet, mouth-watering, bitter. Some brown sugar, bitter right in the middle of the tongue (not back or sides at all), tiny hints of grapes up front but not much else in the way of fruit. Fizzy, of course. Interesting. If I could get it easily I'd have it more often given that I think it's pretty good and the wife loves it!"
"overall emperor did not seem as carbonated as the blue."
"Decent beer, would go good with desert."
"(2008 bottle) Pours like a cola with a slight red tint; very minimal carbonation. Has a spicy taste that flows off the palate. The only beer that remotely resembles this one is the Delirium Noel for is spiciness.This has a fantastic lingering finish."
"As it warms, this beer only becomes smoother and more enjoyable. Awesome."
"A 2008 large bottle pouring chestnut brown with an intense frothy head and a mild fruity nose. Sweet on the tongue, a hint of cherries in the backround with a forward alcohol flavor (which at 11% abv, I suppose is not all that surprising!). Best served with dessert -- some kind of pie and fresh raspberries, dare I suggest a scoop of vanilla to cut the thick molasses of it all? This one is rich!"
"D - Good overall, but slightly too sweet and rich for me."
"UPDATE: Had a 2006 Vintage bottle of this; found at The Beer Depot in Ann Arbor, MI. This bottle was similar to the vintage above but with even greater pungency in smell and taste. Especially in taste, the ""chewiness"" of the middle completely shines through with a Belgian truffle/ maple syrupy-flavor. Absolutely gorgeous. However, this needed to be taken in even smaller quantities to fully appreciate the aroma and the complexity of every meaningful sip."
"Overall, this one lives up to its name. It is like no other beer I have had"
"2007, on tap at Pizza Port, Solana Beach. Much better this time. hazy mahogany pour with a short white head. More sherry and plum aroma and taste. More vinuous. Lighter mouthfeel. Less syrupy sweetness. All around an excellent beer."
" The flavor's are not in perfect harmony, you will not find the balance of something like a Westy 12, but the flavor's are intense and unique. Age this puppy!!"
"I may blame this on a bad bottle, but I won't pay the price of admission on this one again."
"Drinkability: Just a really great beer in about every category imaginable, and well-deserving of the praise it gets. This is drinking pretty well at 2 years old, but I imagine another few years could still do a little more for this beer, so if you got 'em, save 'em - you'll thank yourself. The alcohol is a little high on this one ... ""you know you're a BA when 11.0% is 'a little high'"" ... but it's for the most part hidden well, so that's where the dock comes from, but it's a minor quibble. This is one of the better Belgian beers out there, and is truly an impressive exemplar of the style. Seek it out, age it, drink it, enjoy it. Cheers."
"Poured a flat headed brown ale foggy. not unexpected for an old strong ale, but everything else combined didnt leave me too impressed. smell was of fig and raisen, some dark maltiness. taste was very smooth, but not much else beyond the necessary fig and raisen and other dark fruits. some light cherry. heavy body, remarkably high in alcohol, but a lil bit of a disapointment. all indications are that it aged exactly as it is supposed to, and this is a style that should age well, so im not gonna go crazy with my ratings."
"As seen in the aroma, this beer is just as complex on the palate. So many flavors coming out it so many directions (all listed above in the scent). It all blends so nicely together, with nothing standing out, or too over powering. There are some sweet bourbon tastes to be savored here."
"D: So damn tasty that I don't want to stop drinking it. The potent flavor and very present alcohol slows ya down, though."
"Bottle shared at a tasting. Pours dark maroon with a thin beige head. Smell is dark fruit, bubble gum and is slightly vinuous in the nose as well. Taste is dark fruit, winelike and semi dry in the finish with some belgian candi-sugar. Medium to thin body and lightly prickly carbonation. A touch boozy, and pretty nice for the style, though."
"Poured this from a 25.4 oz corked bottle into a Koningshoeven goblet. Pours a deep molasses color with a caramel cream colored head. Very active. Smells like a candy store that specializes in caramel and chocolate covered cherries. Taste is sweet with a slight tingle on the tongue and a cherry aftertaste. This is a great Strong ale and definitely a must try!"
"There some flavours of sweet rum a sweet alcohol hint that comes in and tickles the palate with a shy carbonated herbal notes, very smooth and end with a very shy caramel touch."
"Nice beer to have with spicy food."
"No question this is a good beer, but the alcohol cut into the overall enjoyement of this beer. My bottle is one year old, so maybe more time underneath the cork will cool it off. But how much remains the question."
"D: This just goes down too easy. Very well balanced in every way. This beer is just so rewarding to drink. If I had to be nit-picky I'd say it might be a little sweet, but it really doesn't bother me at all."
"I had very high hopes for this one. 2007 750ml. I poured it into a pint glass (sinful). As I pored the dark concoction into my glass it seemed thicker than I expected, almost like a stout. There was very little head but it was a very nice tan that left plenty of lacing. Here's where it went downhill. The aroma... full of raisin and fig and brown sugar. All kinds of maltiness. Usually that's the start of something good, but it was overwhelming. Too sweet. The flavor was once again too sweet. Just a thick mouthful of sugary raisin-like liquid. No hops what-so-ever. No underlying teaser of complex flavors inherent to Belgian beers. It was lightly carbonated and very creamy. But in the end I begrudgingly poured the rest down the drain."
"Tasty, but not a session beer."
"My local store still has 3 cases of the 2006, have revisted this beer twice in the last two weeks and tonight I followed it up with a Rochefort 10. Let just say not even close. Guess I am going to buy a case of the 2006 for my cellar.My local store still has 3 cases of the 2006, have revisted this beer twice in the last two weeks and tonight I followed it up with a Rochefort 10. Let just say not even close. Guess I am going to buy a case of the 2006 for my cellar."
"Drinkabilty is moderate. This bottle has a little age on it and it's still boozey, I wonder how aggressive it would be fresh. It's a good tasting beer and I love the mouthfeel though. Definitely a nice sipper, especially on a cool evening. Consider me a fan."
"Drinkability - This bottle is going to do me just fine I can tell, but its going to be no hassle to finish it. Fine tasty brew here."
"D: This beer is so easy to drink. Goes down nice and crisp. The flavors and smells are just damned perfect. I want more. Lots more. These flavors are awesome. This beer is amazing. Big props to Will at Five Points talking this brew up. This beer should be enjoyed by all. It truly is an experience. Fine beer. Expertly crafted."
"D: Definitely a treat. Exceptionally drinkable for the ABV. Great example of a BSDA. I think it might actually do better with some more age on it. I have an '06 that I'll probably keep around for at least 5 more years."
"Lightly toasted malts are a quick prelude to sweet, doughy caramel and toffee malts. Sugary, yet not cloying. Very caramelly. Deep fruit notes mix in. Rummy pears, cooked apples (think apple pie), and a fruit punch/tropical milieu. Figs and dates near the finish, with hints of vanilla and sweet cherry. Wow. Yeasty, sweetish finish with a mild earthy bitterness--very mild. Amazing complexity and off the scales delicious. Full-bodied and almost chewy with a smooth feel. Fantastic!"
"This beer, referred to by many as Grand Cru of the Emperor, is by far one of my favorite beers. Due to the price and ABV, it's not an every day beer. But, it's excellent for special occasions! I am thankful to have been introduce to this beer by a friend!"
"This beer pours a dark mahogany color. The head is a billowy three inches in height, and recedes very slowly into a thick cap of lacing that lasts until the beer is gone. The aroma is of anise, dates, caramel, and a soft candy sweetness. The taste is well rounded. Largely sweet, with enough spices to make things interesting, and a slight alcohol presents in the aftertaste. The mouthfeel is full bodied, with a silky texture, and lively carbonation. Overall, this is a very good Belgian Strong Dark Ale. I will certainly drink this again."
"Complex with balance in abundance. This is immense and a pleasure. Sip and savor."
"I've got another one of these stashed away, and I can hopefully track down a few more before they disappear off the shelves, but right now, I'm going to enjoy every last drop of this bottle on my own."
"Nose is of stewed apples and cinnamon, pear and candied fermented cidre. Taste is sweet similar to nose with cidre, leather. Honeyed and candied. Shoe polish solvent with apple and acidity from yeast (presumably). Bready and malty. Finishes clean with Belgian yeast flair."
"D - Very sweet caramel overall."
"Pours a slighly hazy dark copper with a big off-white head that shows great retention and lots of lacing. The aroma is dominated by the sweet sugary malts and dark fruits - figs, raisins, grapes. The taste is just as sweet as the aroma would indicate. Huge caramel and candy sugar sweetness with vanilla and dark fruit. The mouthfeel is sticky and the sweetness just coats the mouth from the first sip. This is a very complex and enjoyable Belgian ale."
"My favorite at the moment, almost the perfect beer. Hell, maybe it is the perfect beer."
"This is an excellent beer for sure. Highly recommend picking up a bottle of this if available."
"This is an absolutely outstanding Belgian Strong Ale."
"The drinkability is very good a very well done brew some thing I way try to cellar. Prosit, MK"
"D: Goes down very easily, almost too easily for the ABV this is a very balanced, sweet, drinkable beer. Easily one that could get someone in trouble!"
"One of the best belgian beers I've had. Amazing!"
"The taste is like the smell, but even more. This is quite a sweet beer actually. But there is a huge complexity to the sweetness. Some notes of caramel, nuts and raw sugar are found in there too."
"Overall: worth a try"
"[Mouth] Sweet malt, fruit and fresh. Strong and sweet. notes fruit of apple and bananas, a little touch of yeast. i will storage some bottles for the next year."
"pours a nice dark mahogany, though clear. Bubbles nicely, with a soft light brown head, bordering on pillow-y. Laces uniformly. Smells of sweet malt, red fruits, strong alcohol...though not overwhelming. Plummy, pruney, malty flavor...rich and caramel-filled. Mildly roasted quality to the malt. I also get flavors of demerera sugar, cherry juice. Overall impression is a smooth, malty treat with a slight spiced note and a nice warming alcohol presence. Very, very good. Extremely smooth, creamy mouthfeel. An eminently drinkable and digestible quad. Delicious on many levels and a real treat to enjoy."
"I'm a strong dark ale fan, and this is just heaven... esp a $12 bottle bought at $5 on clearance! I had no idea what a gem this was when I came across it at Charles St Liquors, Beacon Hill."
"UPDATE 18MAR12: I forgot I reviewed this. I had an aged version of this beer last year and wow, did the flavors ever come together nicely. It rounded out to be a very smooth and rich tasting beer, from what I recall."
"Review from tasting notes. Dark red/brown, lots of foam, nice amount of lacing. Very boozy aroma, with a strange hint of Cachaca, Rum and Cola. Lots of chocolate notes in the nose and the palate. Cola, rum, dark fruits and chocolate brownie flavors round out the palate. Creamy and buttery feel on the tongue, average carbonation. Very boozy, alcohol can be felt. A sipper, but wonderful nonetheless."
"An excellent Belgian strong ale. Liked the cherry and dark fruit overtones. Maybe a little bit too alcoholic but overall great."
"Pours a deep mahogany brown color with a tan head. Powerful nose. Caramel, cherry, and oak tones are notable. Powerful caramel taste builds off the nose with a slightly sour and acidic cherry balancing. Very unique for a quad and surprisingly good. Well-balanced and highly drinkable. Medium to heavy body that is slightly oily and clingly with an overriding smoothness to it. Very drinkable and very enjoyable as well."
"Gouden Carolus Jaargang 2008 is a great BSDA, one of the very best I've ever had without question and probably one of the top 2 or 3 on my personal list. This is not to be missed. Brilliant."
"Glad I got the chance to try this. I'd buy this if I could find it. Very sippable."
"2008. And I must say that is quite the pretty bottle. Got a gusher here. Slightly fogged gold with a thick off-white head. Nose is sugars and citrus. Slight funk. Flavor is nice. Sugary citrus funk and a slight alcohol burning edge. But it doesn't really mess with things. Real rounded flavor profile. Feel has a smooth liquid touch and the carbonation is low. Extremely easy to drink. I don't really want to think about this one too much. I just want to sip, savor, and enjoy."
"Overall this is an exceptionally smooth beer. Good and thick and goes down smooth. It's very sweet, but not quite too sweet. It's almost like a smooth liquor, but in beer form."
"Never considered forking over fourteen dollars for a bottle of this stuff, so I figured I should try it on draft while I could, probably will not drink it again at its price but glad I tried it, recommended"
"Opinion: This is a really nice beer, and is wonderfully complex. The alcohol is a bit much for me, and I wish that it was a bit more subtle. Other than that, it has a really nice depth of flavor and doesn't leave you wanting for anything...except maybe a glass of water to keep the palate fresh between sips. Either way, I have never been disappointed with a beer from Gouden Carolus, and this is no exception. I really like their tripel, but this is a fine brew nonetheless."
"Cheers!"
"Wonderful beer, one of the best Belgian Strongs I have ever had."
"I would for sure drink this again, but wait until winter time. It's definitely not a summer time beer at all. Flavor, alcohol content, even bottling suggests a solid cold weather beer."
"Considering that strong, dark ales are not my ""thing"" and I actually really like this, I think that those who love this style would be missing out if they didn't give it a try. Plus, I suppose because of the ABV, it stores well - mine was labelled 1996 and here I am drinking it in 2008 and it is outstanding! If you see it, pick it up..."
"Although you get alcohol warmth with this, it's well-controlled for a 10% beer (says 11% on this site, but 10% on the label). Along with its exquisite flavor profile, it's an amazing, slow-sipping, near-transcendent Belgian ale."
"Good amount of carbonation feel and pretty drinkable, even though the abv is high and the fact I can really taste the alcohol. Great belgian style!"
"This is a strong beer with strong flavors. It's great as an extreme beer but I couldn't regularly drink it."
"If you like your Belgians sweet, fruity and boozy, I would definitely recommend you try this Belgian strong dark ale. Pair it with some raw milk morbier and summer stone fruits for a savory after dinner treat."
"D- Way too strong to drink all day, but if it tastes like this id be tempted. the bottle i had is just over 18 months old (bottled feb 24 07). im going to search this one out fresh. highly recommended"
"drinkability - This beer is good. Had it at a beer tasting event, and then had it on tap the next day! Must try, and should be great to age. Website says 10 years!"
"D: This was a great beer. I have had this before but never have i enjoyed it this much. As it warms the bouquet of flavors came out even more. This was an incredibly complex and great ale."
"Drinkability - I would kick another man in the nuts to drink one of these fresh! An example all other Belgian dark brewers should follow or bow down too. It's July and 100 degrees and this is incredible. I would destroy bottle after bottle of this during the holiday season."
"The beautiful bottle is just the tip of the iceberg where this beer is concerned. The beer pours a very rich brown color with a rocky tan head. The aroma is great. A spicy aroma that shows off the nice belgian yeast charecter and aromatic spices. No hops. It has a very smooth and sweet malt flavor. The mouthfeel is good. Lots of alcohol and Belgian lace. It is a full bodied beer with good co2. A really nice Belgian Strong Ale that is good year round."
"Drinkability: Very good beer with great complexity and great flavor. 11% ABV may limit your amounts, but this is a great beer and definitely worth picking up. Highly recommended."
"As these are made in Feb, this one 2007, it has aged nice for almost 1 1/2 years, great."
"I've seen this brew in Colorado before and have always passed on it. I'm glad I decided to give it a try as it is some seriously good beer!"
"Pretty drinkable beer, though the ABV doesn't really allow for it. Overall, pretty impressive."
"No hint of alcohol whatsoever detected in the amazingly-smooth drink. The drink is deceivingly burly! It was gone in a curious sip plus five intrigued near-gulps. I could have enjoyed this light-medium bodied beauty all day...or at least right until it knocked me flat on my ass!"
"The beer pours a burgundy-brown with a frothy tan head. The head dissipates down to a thin film, leaving minimal lace. The aroma is full of caramel and sweet dark fruits. The taste is up front with chocolaty and caramel flavors and is then followed up by some dark fruity sweetness. The beer finishes with a spicy yeasty character. The alcohol presence is surprisingly at a minimum. The body is medium-full bodied with a creamy carbonation. Overall, it is a good Belgian Strong Dark Ale with plenty of complexity. Quite a nice beer."
"Drinkability - with the exception that it's 11 percent alcohol, I could drink numerous of these. Very easy to drink, not to over the top and really well balanced. Does not drink like an 11 percent ABV."
"D: I don't care what the ABV is, this is one delicious beer that I could drink until I passed out. I still think Maudite is amazing, but this one is very, VERY close. Drinkability 4.5"
"Notes: Incredibly nice beer. Although now it is 4 years old and all the hops are gone, it still has a good balance, though now slightly leaning towards the malt. The beer is sweet and very dessert like, but it’s not cloying. Dangerously easy drinking for 10%."
"Bottle says it improves with age, but I didn't have the patience!"
"D : An awesome beer. The alcohol sneaks up on you. Definitely one I will have again."
"This is the definition of dessert beer at its best. Pours a deep brown - nearly black. Moderate carbonation in this one. Smells like sugar, prunes, dried fruit, and a lot of yeast. Taste is brown sugar, alcohol, caramel, and sweet fruit. VERY tasty. One of the better Grand Crus I've had in a while. The moderate carbonation makes this one go down easy without making it feel flat. A little strong to drink more than one, but this is one outstanding brew."
"Very nice brew, sweet and tasty. Oh, and it looks superb in my Maredsous tulip glass. Presentation is everything."
"D: Very sweet beer. Probably couldn't drink a couple bottles of this, but would make an excellent desert beer."
"Drinkability: After a big bottle I feel ready for another one. Not a session beer, but definitely something to sit and enjoy on a rainy day."
"What a divine brew!!"
"With their high price point, BSDAs aren't beers I drink too often, but a beer like this is great for a special occasion."
"Aroma is fairly strong, malty and yeasty with an undertone of hard apple cider. Color is a clear, dark reddish brown with a thick, fluffy, light tan head. Flavor is malty with a hint of molasses and a fairly strong alcohol bite - not surprising since it has an alcohol content comparable to a barleywine. Texture has quite an edge to it, and the malty aftertaste has a little sweetness. An excellent Belgian, worth seeking out."
"Overall, a good brew. Nice sipper after dinner."
"D: This is one of those beers I can respect more than love. It's undeniably well made, but there's a certain harshness to it (possibly due to the alcohol in the taste) that would make me think twice before getting it again. Still, you can't argue with quality."
"This was a 2006 bottle. I loved this beer. Deep deep red to brown. Frothy off white head. Smells of peach, plum, raisins. Tastes alot the same except it finishes with a nice vanallia oakiness. I was suprised at how little to no alcohol heat there was. I would buy again if found. Great beer to have after a big meal or sitting around a fire in the winter."
"Dark beer loathers, and pilsner quaffers need not apply! This is exactly the antithesis of lighter beers, in my opinion."
"Not at all weak or thin, this dark ale is very satisfying and full with good fruit depth. Very well crafted, only lacking in drinkability due to strength of abv, and the sweetness that makes it great for sipping."
"2007 750 ml bottle. Dark reddish brown color with a thick head that that quickly dissipates. Heavier alcohol smell than I was expecting but was not bad. Also smells of yeast, rasins, and spices. Taste is sweet with a bit of alcohol burn at the end. A heavy malt taste with fig and rasins. Feels good in the mouth with the right ammount of carbonation."
"Mouthfeel is almost creamy, really nice amount of carbonation. Not syrupy like some Strong Belgian Ales can be. Although it took me almost 2 hours to finish a pint, it was very enjoyable from start to finish. This beer was so delicious, I will absolutely pick it up again."
"D-Too much for more than 1 750-ml bottle at a time. Could drink a couple of 12-ozers."
"So, the Grand Cru of the Emperor, eh? Well, the emperor has excellent taste. I'll give him that. This is an excellent beer. Go find one...now!"
"D: Very drinkable. A solid, great Belgian brew. Not quite excellent, but close. Strong similarity to St. Bernardus Abt 12. It has aged very well over 3+ years."
"I find the phenolics in this one a bit overpowering - would like to see more complexity and balance with other flavors. This is a very highly rated beer and it was not as good as I had expected. Overall, certainly a good Belgian dark but I believe there are better examples of the style out there."
"A very deep dark and rich Belgian ale. A must try if you enjoy big Belgians."
"D - exceptional. of course."
"Would definitely try this one again."
"D- Other than the 11% ABV which isn't that noticeable, I could and might have a couple glasses. This is a really nice Quad!"
"Mouthfeel is slightly syrupy and full bodied. Sticks nicely to the surface of the mouth and leaves that sweet taste. Mild carbonation leaves just a hint of prickling on the tongue. This is a very, very tasty beer and one that I will be going back to."
"Conclusion: I've had different vintages of this brew before which failed to impress me nearly as much. Most probably I was just too impatient though because this 2003 brew shows me what a helluvah beer the Cuvée van de Keizer can actually be. If conserved right & long enough, this one's a true gem."
"Pours a deep amber color with a light tan head. In the aroma, a mixture of white grapes and licorice. In the taste, grapes and licorice, again, also a small corriander bite and just a hint of alcohol. A somewhat bitter mouthfeel with a dry licorice aftertaste. Quite easy to drink, and lots going on in this beer. Very complex and good."
"Worth a try..."
"Wish I hadn't waited so long for this. I'm going to revisit this ASAP. Seems like a great social beer for hanging out."
"D- I really wanted to not like this beer. I often find myself not liking a lot of Belgian beers unless they are done really well ... and this one is. That being said it is going to be hard for me to finish this whole bottle, I think sipping on one glass is awesome though."
"I would buy again next time I make a trip to Delaware."
"I was thrilled to have this, especially after the Kwak I had two days ago that was God awful (similar beers, for those who don't know, but avoid the Kwak like death). Poured with a slight 1/4 inch head. Balanced taste, with the hoppiness undercutting the sweetness, but a nice a finish. Very drinkable, and I could certainly see buying it again later on."
" Admittedly, this beer is not cheap but in this case the kingly price tag does reflect the quality of the product inside. Almost always listed as one of the best beers in the world, I have to imagine that the Grand Cru of the Emperor would please the palette of Charles V and meet his holy roman hopes."
"S - Wonderful dark fruity smell."
"Drinkability: A brew that I imagine could certainly be cellared for a long, long time. It was around $8 for the bottle, which is good considering how long it took me to drink it by myself, as this is certainly a sipper. The Gouden Carolus Trippel is one of my favorites, and this ranks up there with it. Huge complexity, tons of flavors, and continually changes and grows as it gets warmer. I have another bottle cellaring, and I hope I can wait at least a few years until it gets cracked open. A fantastic brew overall -- pick it up if you can."
"D: Pretty damn good beer all around. A bit high in the ABV for drinking too much."
"Truly marvelous. I do wish, however, that the mouthfeel was a tad bit thicker. But, a small quibble, overall."
"Good, but a bit of a sipper at warm temperatures."
"Overall, a standard strong dark ale. Good, but I've had much better."
"Taste is very close to the smell department, with lots going on from the dark fruits to the malt to all the various spices intermingling with each other. Carbonation was a bit low but it worked for this, although I couldn't see myself drinking too much of this beer, the complex tastes would be too overwhelming."
"The Emperor can reign over me anytime. A perfect substitute for a late bottled vintage port."
"Notes - This beer has a port-like quality that makes it very unique to me. Excellent stuff."
"Overall this is an excellent beer. Especially considering its price. Highly recommended and well worth seeking out."
"Body is a deep dark brown with hints of ruby red around the edges when held to light. Head is a even tan fuzzy foam with very nice retention. The nose you actually pick up as you open the bottle but once you pour it into the glass, wow! This is a hugely fragrence loaded bomb that is almost overtaking. Notes of Belgian waffles, ripe bananas, vanilla, and soft zesty spice. inters the mouth with silky sweetness and a real mouth filling doughy spicey richness. hints of buttered rum, and earthy vanilla grace the tongue. Mouthfeel is long and sticky thick from the sweetness. A wonderfully big beer. Sweetness is maybe a little to much, and slightly hampers the drinkability."
"Thanks to Wasatch for the recommendation! One of the best beers I've had to date..."
"D: This is one of the standards for this style, I think Charles V would be proud, a really good ale."
"M - Thick and free from the carbonated feeling often associated with ales. Slight resistance in the swallow accompanying the bitter flavor."
"Poured into a chalice a brown/mahongy color, very nice carbonation (POP upon opening), nice creamy off-white head, nice creamy sticky lacing and small islands abound. The nose is malty, yeasty, lots of dark fruits, and caramel. The taste is absolutly delicious, sweet, malty, slight yeast tones, figs, raisins, plums, caramel. Nice little chewiness, smooth as hell, alcohol is hidden pretty well, nice warming effect. Full body, complex brew. Very drinkable, AWESOME brew, highly recommended."
"Very, very impressive."
"This is the type quality, that I will pull out of the cellar and give to some of my more micro-novice buddies and coworkers and proudly exclaim ""This is what beer CAN taste like."""
"A very nice example of the style reminiscent of Westvleteren 12."
"Jaargang 2006, Appearance is a murkey brown with a thin off white head. Smell is soft with dark fruits, caramel and belgian yeast. Taste has a creamy richness to it that masks the alchohol quite well considering the ABV. Mouthfeel is creamy medium+ that goes down smooth with a slight bite of carbonation, making it one of the better belgian strong ales that I have tried."
"If i could find this beer again, i would buy several cases and drink it almost exclusively. Again, i cannot emphasize enough how much i enjoyed this beer. Worth a try or seven!"
"drinkability: wish I had more of this year"
"D: Not a beer for a summer day that is for sure, an interesting beer to try and not bad at all, just very sweet and rich so it would be a good idea to share this bottle or buy a smaller one for personal use."
"This is an incredibly easy beer to drink (especially considering its strength) and a new favorite."
"Christmas Eve beer. Poured a very dark brown, reddish hues when held to the light. Very little head, even with an aggressive pour. What there was, was white and left some lacing. Potent aromas let me know that I am in for a pleasant evening. Sweet berries, figs, sugar and spice vie for my attention. No auslese wafts of alcohol getting in the way either. Very nice. These aromas are less evident in the taste. What is quite strong though is the overwhelming sweetness of this beer. Surprisingly, this is not a cloying sweetness, but fades rather quickly, leaving you ready for the next sip. Mouthfeel is a bit thin, but does not detract. Drinkability is quite high considering the sweetness and the alcohol level. Wonderful stuff for a special occasion. One of the best sweet beers I have had the pleasure of drinking."
"Overall - A great beer. In league with Rochefort 10 and Westmalle Dubbel."
"750ml corked and caged bottle with 2006 printed on the neck label. Poured a medium slightly hazy brown with a 1 finger head, OK longevity and lace. Aromas of candi sugar, sherry, dried fruits and somewhat yeasty and bready. The alcohol really comes through upon tasting. Its sweeter that I expected. Lots of sherry and dried fruit flavors but not as rich as is needed to tone down the 10% abv. If this beer was about 6 or 7% it would be awesome, but the alcohol is just too potent. It's going to be tough to down this 750 myself."
"I cannot beleive this beer does not have more reviews! This is by far one of my favorite belgians. This beer pours a deep dark brown with little head ( this varies by vintage). The mouthfeel is incredibly smooth and creamy, by far the smoothest beer i have ever drunk at 10% abv. taste is typical of the het anker brewery, similar to the classic but much richer and warmer. impressively almost no alcohol on the finish. tastes of dark fruit and a tasty version of a strong french or belgian amber. This beer only improves with age and should be appreciated slowly ( as hard as that may be) in front of a warm fire on a cold night alone or with a very good friend. Zalig Genieten!"
"D: A dinged it a bit on drinkability due to the alcohol. The delicious flavors make it an outstanding beer. A great brew for my 100th review."
"For me the alcohol content is way too much, what is the point of having 11% alcohol and let it cover by a huge sweet body? So for mouthfeel I took some points off, nevertheless a good beer."
"If you like complex chewy Belgians, buy this, you won't be sorry"
"Pours a deep, almost burnt walnut with almost no haze. The head is thin, but retains on the surface. The aroma is of rasins, caramel, and vanilla, with a hint of oak. Upon tasting, the beer begins with dark fruit. Prune, fig, and banana pour through. The finish is strong and sweet. with toffee and vanilla. This beer is full-bodied, strong, yet amazingly smooth. It's not what I expected. For it's strength, it is almost too easy to drink. I had to hold back from taking it all to myself. It's not for the beginner by any means. This is one that needs to be worked up to. It's definitely a beer that I will buy in future vintages. The bottle I had was from 2006, and it would probably hold up to at least another five to ten years of age."
"D - For an 11% beer I could carry around a snifter of this all day! Truly fantastic. I made sure to go out and purchase another bottle to let sit for a few years....will see if that one comes out as good..I hope so!"
"On tap at the Bodega in LaCrosse, Wisconsin. Pours a dark amber with a short, creamy head. Nose is slightly spicy, notes of cinnamon and a faintly cloves. Decent mouth feel, thought not the same velvety smoothness of the bottled version. Good body. Nice clean finish. While this is better than 90% of the beers out there, the bottled version blows this away. That being said, still a great beer."
"D = Very VERY drinkable."
"I just had the 2008 version. I think I bought it without remembering my previous review. Which was a good thin, because this was far better than last year. The aroma was dark fruit and licorice. Taste was anise, dark fruit, and a good malt presence. Much more fun to drink."
"2006 vintage. Pours a cloudy dark brown with amber hues, a medium sized light tan to cream head slowly recedes with minimal lacing. Aroma is sweet dark fruits, plums and raisins and overripe fruit. Also a softer sweetness of brown sugar and caramel, nice breadiness and hints of banana as well as some vinuous qualities like cherries, very complex. Outstanding aroma, at times there are some classic Belgian qualities while at others it is like a nice aged English barleywine, sweet and malty. Taste follows suit with strong aged barleywine characteristics of sweet dark fruits and caramel malts. Still some hoppiness in this vintage with some hints of crispness mixing with a bite of the alcohol strength. Medium to heavy in body, carbonation is low, but soft and creamy where present. Outstanding beer, very unique and quite complex, cant wait to try some older vintages and see how it progresses."
"2006 vintage, 750ml bottle Poured a wonderful burgundy color with a slight white head . Aromas of wine fresh bread and malts . Medium-bodied and slight carbonation . This Ale drinks like a cognac . Big fruity flavors along with some malty sweetness but not overly sweet .This bottle was a well balanced. I will enjoy this Ale watching the Red Soxs tonight nomatter what the outcome (Go Soxs)"
"-Oelergud"
" Overall I really like this. I did not know what to expect when going in, but this was really quite fantastic. It had a full body and feel, and such a robust and complex flavor profile, that at times you just did not know where to turn to next. A more then balanced feel and approach led to this being one of the favorites of the night. Now dont get me wrong this was not for the faint of drink, rather something that was to be appreciated by those who knew how to appreciate it. A fine choice that you should definitely try and seek out."
"Kind of heavy, but not too much so actually, lightly carbonated. Very smooth and silky. Huge taste for such a smooth beer. This was absolutely wonderful!"
"Comment: After a couple of brews that left a bitter chemical aftertaste this was a treat. It really makes one appreciate it when a brewer gets the concepts of balance and subtlety."
"D: Very drinkable, to say the least. The 11% is incredibly well hidden."
"Cuvee, Grand Cru, call it what you will, it is bold, blended, and craftily marvelous with a full flavor slate and an impressively assertive character. The ABV is mighty and apparent, but it also works in smooth step with a fetching result and a very drinkable sensibility. Hell, call it anything, call it Ishmael, I don't care, but please just make sure you call me when you break one open."
"Everytime I drink this brew I get amazed how complex it is. One of the best Dark Strong Belgium Ale's you can find. Highly recommended."
"Pours a medium brown in color with a large, creamy tan colored head. Head disappears a little quickly and leaves some sticky lacing along the side of the goblet. Smell is of belgian candied sugar and some sweet malt. The taste on this beer resembles somewhat of chimay at first then other flavors come in and almost overpower. Figs, raisins, molasses, almost overpowering... but good. Medium to full bodied makes this a sipper with a slight warming presence. At 11% this is a nice heavy beer that I am intimidated to finish since I work early tomorrow, but I think I will enjoy it!"
"Gouden Carolus Carolus D'Or - Grand Cru of the Emperor 2006 pours a medium brown that has cherry highlights when held to the light with a thin off white head from a brown 750 ml Bottle into my Cuvee Van De Keizer chalice. It has a nice aroma that's mostly dark fruit, perhaps some honey on bread too. The mouthfeel is quite nice, a little on the thick end of the spectrum. The flavor is nice, dark fruit and brown sugar come to mind. A very enjoyable brew."
"Pours a dark belgian with a huge creamy head that sticks to the glass throughout. This is a big boy no doubt about it. Smells of fig, dried fruit, molasses and malt. Tastes nicely sweet with sugar, caramel, fig, apricot, and butterscotch. Feels like a delicous dessert with alcohol warming throughout. Medium to thick on the tongue. Nice carbonation finishes this tasty brew. If you want a trappist like beverage this dark beauty is a winner. Could have another but I would be drinking my dinner. A must try."
"I certainly wasn't disappointed. This is one to keep around for a day when you really deserve something special."
"Overall, this beer started off slow for me, but really impressed in the end. The head retention, or lack there of is probably because of the high abv. The heat provides a solid backbone for both the nose and the flavor profile. Packs a punch! Recommended."
"D: I'll probably never try this beer again. In my estimation, the beer is overspiced and way too sweet. Some, however, may enjoy these qualities and would appreciate the beer more than do I."
"Final Comments: I had this on a Friday night and on Saturday morning I was back buying every bottle they had left. It would definitely age nicely but whats the point when it is already so fuggin fantastic?"
"Great beer."
"I've now had the four most widely distributed Brouwerij Het Anker offerings and I've been gobsmacked by each and every one. I had no idea this was the case, but on scores alone, this is my favorite Belgian brewery. Grand Cru of the Emperor (as my bottle reads) or Cuvee Van De Keizer... whatever you call it, call it an outstanding example of the brewer's art."
"Besides the accumulative sweetness of the beer, this is a masterpiece. A true treat for anyone. After having tried a string of mediocre Belgian beers, this is one that made me stop and remember just why the Belgian's are masters at this craft. Prosit!"
"Dark brown with a good head and good lacing.Head fades a little quicker than I would like. Aroma is very nice indeed,very full bodied, a little sweet, a little alcohol.Sweet malts and spice predominate. Taste is similar, but with a nice depth. More sweet malt and spice, as well as brown sugar and dark fruit. Very balanced and creamy. Although a little on the sweet side, the beer isn't sticky or tiresome at all. Delicious, and my favorite from this brewery."
"Drinkability - Wow, this is a Cadillac.. so to speak. Really glad that i had the opportunity to experience this one...and fully plan to cellar a number of these to experience the improvement with age. Ranked 3 or 4 in the Belgian Strong Dark Ale style!?! My FAV style is being re-considered."
"D - Boozy but still extremely drinkable."
"The beer poured a dark amber with a lovely white head. The aroma was of toasted caramel and sweet malt. The tase stared with toasted caramel malt and then closed with a fine alcohol burn. The feel was heavy and dry giving a pleasant weight to the drink. A very wonderful grand cru that I will be searching out in the future."
"D - Delicious worth having, I'll definitely have this again (if I ever come across another oppurtunity to have it). A little too sweet perhaps."
"my corked and caged bottle set me back $9.48 at my local North Coast Coop. Poured a dark red to brown with a moderate tan head that left really sticky lacing as it settled. This was the 2006 version and checked in at 10% ABV. Nose is very fruity, with banana first, but in the background is a very complex set of odors with plums, raisins, and citrus. Mouthfeel is very full bodied and rich and sweet, and flavors are molasses, fruit, and chocolate malts. Finish is sweet. Very unique strong ale,and I guess I will have to go back and get some more and let it age some more. I plan to open a bottle every February 24th."
"Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied, with a very smooth almost creamy carbonation. The drinkability is pretty good, put is hurt a little by the alcohol and sugary sweetness."
"D - This is a very good Belgian beer. Great character and flavor. Next time I'll try an older Grand Cru."
"Belgian Strong Ales are not my absolute favorites, but there are many that I have really enjoyed. Unfortunatley, this was not one of them, and I finally poured the last quarter down the drain...which really sucks given the price."
"this beer holds up like christopher walken over time, and still tastes like a fresh bottle with minor age adjustments. could easily go another two years with happy results. as far as anker's beers go, this is top-shelf. it was my last bottle and by god i sure as shit enjoyed it."
"Pours a rich brown color with minimal head. Smell is malty and sweet with some mild fruity notes - prune and plums mostly. Taste was sweet with lots of caramel flavors and some mild chocolate. Thought it was close to a dubbel with the high caramel taste. Sticky sweetness on the tongue. Overall, I thought this was tough to drink, but I am not a fan of dubbels and this one reminded me too much of that style. Not a bad beer but not a fan of beers with lots of caramel flavors and taste."
"This is a good one to split with some friends, a very rich Belgian strong. Try with some bittersweet chocolate."
"I poured into a chalice - dark reddish brown with a nice 1 finger white head that goes away quickly and leaves some concentrated lacing. There's also tons of sediment floating around, as you might expect. The smell is all kinds of wonderful - grapes, red apple, & honey - all of it melds together well and is totally inviting. The taste is like candy - there is a port like sweetness followed by an green apple like sourness and it finishes clean. There is no cloying sweetness - a wonderfully balanced taste. The slight carbonation offers more complexity and adds a slight chewiness. Man, this is easy drinking - quite simply a delicious treat. 7 years of aging was no problem for this brew. Highest recommendation."
"drinkability: very easy to drink almost like a dessert. went great with carrot cake. however, alcohol became present about 2/3 of the way through, and i would recommend sharing it with someone if you get a 750ML."
"Nice Belgian brew overall. Not my favorite style, but I appreciated this one."
"This is one of the finer versions of Gouden Carolous, and a pleasant after dinner treat. It drinks like a port wine. In fact, I've heard unsubstantiated reports that port is actually added to this brew."
"A real eye-opener. I've had countless Belgian Strong Darks before, but this one really showed me what one can be, and how well this can represent the style. I'm very appreciative of what they've done with this and will seek it out again."
"I just happened to read from a fellow BA about a package store in Manchester that was highly rated when I found this absolute gem of a Belgian. Somewhat suprising, given that overall beer selection was good but not as strong as my usual place. The appearance of this 2004 Belgian got me stoked up right off the bat. I'm a big strong brown fan, and this one did not disappoint. A beautiful molasses brown with a thick tan head as I poured it into my Duvel tulip glass. The lace graced the glass deep into the session. And the aroma ! Sweet, candied sugar with an alcohol accent. Dates, raisens and prunes rose from the glass and again presented themselves in the taste. The candied sugar was highly evident along with hints of cinnamon. Mind you, the aroma and flavor were balanced with sweet overtones, but the sweetness did not overwhelm either. A warm, alcohol presence with explosions of flavor with each sip. The mouthfeel was thick and chewy, precisely what makes for a wonderful strong brown belgian. This is a highly drinkable session brew that the Belgian fan will absoultely savor. It is also added to my personal favorites list."
"T:"
"Drinkability: Tremendous flavor, with an alcohol presence that remains well hidden throughout. Superb beer."
"this is an exquisite beer."
"This is my new favorite beer. Picked up a dusty 2005 at a bottle shop in Littleton CO. I won't name the place because they were a-holes and I will never shop there again. Anyway, the beer - what a wonderful discovery. The color as it pours out into my Duvel glass glass is a lovely sight to behold, the smell is fantastic and really accounts for a good percentage of this beer's quality. The taste is truly amazing. Sweet, but not too sweet. Wonderfully balanced. Mind you, I am NOT a hop-head so anything too bitter will end up down the drain at my house. Anyway, this beer is SO good. If anyone knows where in Denver to find more, please let me know. Cheers!"
"D: Delicious. Tremendous depth with awesome flavor. Could even use a few more years of aging to showcase the tastes. Really a proper example of a good dark Belgian ale"
"The mouthfeel is smooth and velvety. This beer goes down a little too easy. This is a very good candidate for cellaring. One of the best, highly recommended."
"Bottom line: this is a killer brew, pick some up now while you can; I'll definitely be picking up another bottle soon."
"This offering has been aged since 2004, so it is about 3 years old. It pours a dark brown, with some light penatration. Leaving no head at all, the aroma is dark pitted fruit, plum, pears, raisins, dark syrup, wow so complex and sweet leaving a port like quality for all to admire. The taste starts cordial, moving to just a faint amount of hops but showcasing a malty, sweet, syrupy delight. The taste mirrors the nose dark fruit, raisins, plums, prunes, and finishes syrupy in the back of the palate. This is one fanastic aged brew and I'm glad I got a full growler of this one."
"Strong yet not even close to overpowering, very easily drinkable and only a slight bitter ."
"D: Im a fan of it, nothing special nothing uperb but a good overall beer which I may buy again."
"This is an exceptional beer here. It has it all."
"Vintage 2006. Served a deep ruby amber with a decent frothy head. The aroma was charged with spice followed by a very complex malt profile, burnt caramel and molasses. The first sip absolutely knocked my socks off, it was likely the best sip of beer I've ever had. After that, for some reason, it wasn't quite as good, albeit still very enjoyable. The taste was almost like a blend of grape juice and caramel malts. There was a sweet gelatin character in the mouthfeel. The alcohol was present, but not overpowering. This one is a very enjoyable sipper."
"D: Would only have one of these."
"D: A fine ale, perfect for sipping on a special occasion (Happy Birthday!) and for pairing with foods. In our case it was a terrific medley of cheeses and meats on our weekend excursion to the rainy and cold Oregon coast. Not every cheese or meat was perfectly matched, but throughout it all, this fine beer was a nice compliment, spicy, warm and rich. Highly recommended."
"Very nice, not sure which I liked better."
"I gave this beer a ""3" in the drinkability category only because with a beer as rich and complex as this, I really wouldn't want to drink these all night. In fact, I was glad I didn't have to tackle that 750 alone. That being said, I wish I had one right now..."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, sugary, somewhat syrupy, and a bit boozy."
"Drinkability: As big and complex as any of the Belgians, the sweetness factor limits its drinkability to a modest amount after dinner"
"Thanks for the sample sammy!"
"drinkability is good. alcohol is kind of warm, but very nice."
"Poured into a chalice with an impressive unfiltered raisin hue. A gentle dark tan head dissipated into a foam-like halo halfway down the glass. This beer had wonderful smells of sweet malt, brown sugar, and mild trailing yeasty tones. The taste was fairly close, warm banana bread, sweet figs, and subtle appearances of malt. This medium to heavy bodied dark ale finished with semi sweet, fresh wheat bread-like notes. This beer paired great with Port Salut cheese, double cream brie, and tart green apple wedges...Enjoy"
"Thick mouthfeel and heavily carbonated. Nice, but not one I'll buy for myself. The phenols got a bit over-persistent for my funk-sensitive palette by the end."
"One of the best beers I've had during the wonderful Lucky Baldwin's Belgian Beer Festival. I really cannot fault the beer in any way. It's just a delicious beer. Try it if you get the chance!"
"Santé"
"Clear, deep chestnut with a strong reddish hue when held to the light. It poured with a modest cap of light tan foam that left a solid sheet of bubbles on the glass as it subsided. Subsequent sips yielded plentiful streaky lacing, right to the end of the glass. Sweet, boozy aroma with lots of plum and figs. Notes of caramel and bread crust were also evident, along with brown sugar and plump raisins. Toffee and honey sweetness hit my palate right away, evening out into a more fruity middle with prunes and plums taking over. A little spicy as well, but very subdued. Bready towards the end, it finished with lingering earthy raisins, caramel and soft alcohol. Medium to full bodied, the carbonation was well integrated and supported the near syrupy texture. Significant alcohol warmth, particularly in the finish, with some creaminess. Very tasty and highly recommended. I really liked the way the flavours balanced each other without the need for much bitterness. It went down very smooth, even with the high alcohol, so watch out!"
"Tiny bubbles let you know the carbonation is there, but they didn't break up the smooth, easy-drinking texture. I downgraded the drinkability slightly only because I found the sweetness a bit overbearing after awhile."
"Overall this beer is a sipper and worth aging, will stock the cellar with a few of these."
"Very drinkable. Strong and boozy yet easy to down. A 750 is gone in minutes."
"2005 vintage. Pours a fairly clear burgundy-brown with ruby red highlights. Creates a beige thick, rocky head which maintains a thin covering throughout the glass. Lots of sticky web-like lacing as snifter drains. Incredibly rich, intense aromas of brandy-soaked dried dark friuts, plums, cherries, brown sugar, bubblegum and oak all amped up by a big alcohol punch. Mouthfeel is well balanced; smooth, full and silky with a pleasant spritzy carbonation. Big and round for a 10%er. Flavors very similar to the nose. Head spiningly sweet intense notes of brandy soaked black cherries, raisins, figs, caramel and plums. Just a hint of anise, wood and spice in the background. The 10% abv comes to the rescue here with a faint hop presence to prevent this superb Belgian from becoming too cloyingly sweet. In the final analysis a rich, pleasing, complex and very warming slow sipper to be enjoyed on a cool winter night."
"The head poured out well and left s little small lacing. The smell was very nice with sweet and very dry tones. The taste was very nice and dry with the sweetness that wasn't too dry. The mouthfeel was very nice and not unpleasant at all. Overall this was a great beer and I will have more in the future."
"I will have to grab another 2006 while they're cheap and put it away for two years, and update accordingly. I think this could be an incredible icon of the grand cru world, given it's time."
"My first beer of 2007"
"Poured out of a 750ml cage & corked bottle. Pours a cola like brown color with an average tan head that dissipated into a ring around the glass. The smell is of figs and the newton, brown sugar, prunes, roasted/bready malt, spicy. The taste is of alcohol soaked rum raisin bread, cane sugar, and red grape juice. The feel is moderate to well bodied with tight and fizzy carbonation that finishes slick and syrupy; sticky and sweet. A very flavorful brew but is almost cloyingly sweet and sticky and the ABV can put a small horse down."
"Big body, big alcohol that leads to big smooth and full mouthfeel...rich and rewarding, thus highly recommended. You really don't want to pass this one by...truly, Belgian!"
"¡Salud!"
"Drinkability: Smooth and sweet. Neither the alcohol nor sweetness is overpowering."
"Vintage 2002. Not much head and a brown beer with wite fog under it. Nose is lots of port , musty, burnt arome, alcoholic andvery heavy oxidised overall. Taste is also strong and porty, quiet sweet, wood, roastyness decent but there and backed by medium bitterness that's quiet far gone and warming alcohol. Certainly well brewed but kind of shocked that this one ages obviously quiet hard and don't think it will gain much more but certainly some will disagree. Still good adchievement and something ellse as the fresh version. Must like port though to really like this."
"Pours a dark brown caramel color with a one finger cap that settled to thin fish-eye lacings. Aroma of dark caramel, raisins, toffee, rum-soaked currants, vanilla, oak, sour cherry, slight banana, candy and earthy wheat. Some alcohol on the nose. Flavor is powerfully full of fruity esters of raisins, sour cherry, and pomegranates. Deeply malty with caramel and honey. Vanilla and Oak hang in the background and there's a slight sourness to break up the sweetness. Bitterness is mild with slight spicy/peppery notes. Alcohol is noticible and warm. Body is medium-full, and carbonation is medium. Very excellent beer!"
"It pours a deep, rich mahogany brown. Clear with a thick persistent foam. The scent is sweet with tones of caramel and candy. The taste is even more forceful. Again with caramel and candy. Aftertastes of toffee and praline. It is very smooth, as you'd expect a beer this sweet to be. It feels like a double or triple and at times is cloyingly sweet which at times detracts from it's drinkability. Overall, this is a masterful brew and definitely should be on the list of ones to try if you can get your hands on some."
"Drinkability - this is excellent ale, very complex and rewarding. High abv obviously limits sessionability. Enjoy with food."
"Second time on this one. Pours a hazy brown/ruby, big off white head, nice lacing, great retention. Smell is sweet, tons of toffee, alcohol, spices, yeasty, some banana, real strong. Taste is very sweet at first, big toffee and apples, alcohol, spices and banana. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium to high carbonation, lots of heat, but a nice strong Belgian."
"Purchased at Sam's the bottles says 2005. Poured into a chalice a hazy dark brown with warm red high lights. The head rises to a nice thickness and then slowly dissipates to a point and lingers, leaving lacing all around. It smells predominantly of sweet malts, candied apples, or even the smell of a half eaten apple set out a while (which honestly is nice because the sugars come more forward) brown sugar, figs, caramel, bread and minor toasted notes. For me some of the fruit esters really come into their own and then fall back on old, but excellent standards. The taste is sweet with mildly bitter caramel notes, then some brown sugar onto a slightly carbonated taste of banana, apple bread. The drink finishes with a mellow cooked green apple flavor coupled with well-balanced raison and supportively helpful hops. The mouthful is nice on this one. Honestly the 11%abv was not present in the smell, but has come to full strength after the beverages was imbibed. This is a wickedly strong, yet tasty brew, totally Belgium and kick ass in a very pleasing way. Its like every sip evokes a history and intoxicates me all the more. There is no question that I will buy this again, its more do I buy one to show a friend or two so I always have one around for special occasions."
"A wonderfully full-flavored Belgian strong dark ale. The flavors are fantastic and complex, and it has a sublime mouthfeel. A must have!"
"I think that a few years in the bottle really allowed this beer to some into it's own. I haven't yet reviewed a young sample, but the ones I have tried are not as smooth and complex. It's insanely drinkable for the ABV and just a stellar beer all around. If you have this one available to you, throw it in your cellar for a few years - it will certainly be worth the wait."
"I'm not a huge fan of the Belgians but this beer was enough to almost turn my head around. Had it on tap at Max's this week and I'm glad I did. It came out in a goblet without any head to speak of but had a deep, rich mahogany color that hinted of complex flavors yet to come. This is probably the best smelling beer Ive ever had, lush and malty with toffee, plumy notes. It just wafted out of the glass. The taste was great, all kinds of malt, not sweet at all, jammy, pruney flavors and no real alcohol bite. Its a sipper but why hurry? The mouth feel was extremely smooth and drinkability was right up there. Wow! I like these pleasant surprises. Truly a great beer and a once in a long while on tap availability."
"D- Very sweet, but it would go great with something sweet and sour I think. This is luxury in a glass."
"There is no need for me to have 750ml of this beer. Unless you are sharing this with someone else, there is no reason for you to do the same."
"This ones tasty, and really easy to drink. Over all, I thought the banana was a little much but for a beer this strong, it went down surprisingly well."
"I will definitely be getting more of this and will seek out other vintages."
"Drinkability: This is a big one that will demand some slow sipping. It gets easier with each sip, but I cant imagine having more than one or two of these in a sitting. Overall, a well-crafted beer that was very much enjoyed."
"Mouthfeel is sublimely smooth. First flavor to strike the palate is an intense sugary sweetness, followed immediately by a portlike robust flavor that is coupled with some nuttiness when aerated. Finish is exquisite, with the nuttiness giving way to a warming balanced alcohol sensation that glides down the throat, as your taste buds beg for another sip. A simply amazing beer!"
"Poured this out of a brown 11.2 oz bottle, ABV 8%. This ale has a great color, a dark copper accented with a cranberry glow. A rather weak, though lacey, head disspated quickly in a large tulip glass. The pleasing bouquet was filled with notes of chocolate, plum, and rich malt. The taste offered malt and various spices on the front palate, moving to a candy coated and stong alcohol finish. Mouthfeel was lively and full, yet the candy-alcohol finish was overpowering and almost deadened my tongue for future sips. However, I grew used to the finish and it compared nicely with other ales of its ilk."
"However, electing to select this beer for consumption while attempting to work from home was a bad idea. My head started getting fuzzy before I had even finished half the bottle."
"Even at room temp, this is simply a privilege to drink..the flavors absolutely jump out at you. Fantastic brew."
"Pours a moderately dark brown thats very hazy. Head is generous and continues to grow long after pouring has stopped. Smell is mostly of alcohol, and faintly resembles candied fruits and caramel. The taste is big and intricate, but oddly simple at the same time. The two most dominant tastes are of the aforementioned alcohol and candied fruits, but the amount of carbonation makes it so neither one can take hold on your tongue and leaves you begging for more. It's also reminiscent of Belgian quadruples, but much more drinker-friendly and a little less intense. This beer also goes down easy, something I was not expecting."
"D: Very drinkable, even at 10% or so. The spices keep the taste buds guessing and the beer itself is not overpoweringly strong."
"Poured dark scarlet brown with a meek white head. The dominant note in the nose is cherries and maybe rum. Maybe a little red licorice too. Taste is kind of syrupy sweet cherries, lots of floral notes, caramel, and more red licorice. Mouth is nice. A bit thick with carbonation that feels active as you let the liquid play around the mouth. If I had money to burn I could see buying this often. Luckily I have access to many aged vintages ... for the right price."
"Drinkability- Wonderful brew here. The 10% hits pretty hard and fast. I shared the bottle and was feeling pretty good after the 12oz I had. Will seek this out in the future for sure. Not sure how it fares fresh, but the 2 years I had it didn't hurt it, that's for sure."
"D- only lower than the rest because this is a serious beer, a definite sipping beer, Grand Cru's are very strong"
"I wanted to taste the 2005 and 2003 side by side, but it wasn't to be. I don't care. This is an instant all-time favorite."
"Taste is very sweet. Candy sugar and black fruit, spiced raisins and cream sherry. Orange zest and coriander. Lots of flavors jockeying for position but somehow they all mesh wonderfully. Mouth is rich and sticky yet wonderfully smooth. A bit sweet but a nice sipper."
"D- If this bottle is old...then let me drink it all the time."
"Poured from a 750ml bottle. Appearance was a light/pale brown color with some copper hints. Head was smallish and tan in color. No haze, virtually clear. Aroma was malt first, followed by caramel and bubblegum. Alcohol peeked through. Flavor was extremely complex, with caramel and honey dominating for me. The mouthfeel was creamy, and this is really where the alcohol could be picked up as a warmth. Otherwise, 11% was well hidden. I enjoyed this, and would have again."
"The smoothness is incredible; top notch. The warmth will catch ya every time, nearly every sip in fact, which slows it down for enormously fine, big, sippage. Damn fine stuff!"
"This is one big beer, sumptuous and bold, one to savor. This is so rich that it should be paired carefully -- only the richest meats, creamiest/funkiest cheeses, or earthiest desserts will survive."
"Drinkability: very enjoyable slow sipper, but the alcohol reminds you this can be a dangerous brew if several glasses are consumed. This is a must find and try."
"This was a pretty good beer. Poured a dark red with a tan head and a bit of lacing. Smelled and tasted of dark fruity malts with a touch of yeast. Taste is a mix of plum and raisony goodness. A thick, rich and sweet beer, the kind you can sip for a couple hours. Go find a bottle and split it with your best friend."
"750 mL bottle, corked and caged, with ""Jaargang 2005"" printed on the cork. It pours into the balloon glass a deep, sedimented garnet with a 1 finger tan head that leaves a decent amount of lace and reduces to a cap of fine bubbles. It is hugely aromatic with a chalky yeast character hidden behind rich, fruity malts that contribute cherries, pears, banana/plantain, honeydew, watermelon, green apple, anise, and a bit of a floral character. The flavor mimics the bouquet quite nicely, tasting almost the same, on top of a medium to thick body that begins almost prickly, but smooths out as I drink. This is a truly wonderful Belgian... I need to go get another bottle before they sell out."
"2005 edition. Pours a dark brown with ruby highlights. The off-white to tan head starts off at about two fingers and fades to a small ring of lace. The nose has dark fruit, toffee, brown sugar, fig, liquorice, mocha, yeast, and booze. The taste starts with sweet malts, brown sugar, dark fruit, liquorice, and mocha with the 10% ABV constantly looming. I'm glad to revisit this gem now that I've have the palate and experience to truly appreciate it."
"Maybe I'll try it again someday to see if it's different fresh."
"A great reward for a hard week's work."
"D - I cant abide by this unbalanced sweetness. This beer is to sweetness as Stone's Ruination is to bitterness. Only times two."
"The first pour from the bomber brings cleaner fruit flavors with a less muddled character; however it may lack richness and complexity. Later pours bring a deeper, maltier flavor from the sediment in the bottle, and left the beer less dry and palatable. I prefer the later pours after the sediment had been aroused. As for Strong Dark Belgian Ales, this beer applies a very fruit-driven signature rather than a malt-forward base as do most."
"This beer has been in the cellar for a year and a half. No real difference from a fresh version. Long lasting off-white head. Strong aroma of grapes and dark fruit. A bit different than a Chimay Bleu, for example. Can't really taste the 11% alcohol. Doesn't seem to have the richness of the Chimay. I have a few more 2004's that I hope to try in another year or so. Will re-rate at that time."
"Mouthfeel- Good carnonation mixes weel with this light to medium bodied brew. Lots of strong sugars that remind me of molasses."
"Drinkability: Excellent a smooth sipper that is very tasty on the way down. I bet this one would age excellently, and mellow even more than it already is. Fantastic."
"Ut Vivat, Crescat, Floreat!"
"I picked up this 2004 vintage corked and caged bomber from Bullocks in Marietta. Although great care was exercised in not shaking the bottle during the uncaging and uncorking ceremony, I still found a gusher in my hand that lost about an ounce of liquid on the desktop. I had never seen a beer form a head in the bottle before this one. The body was deep burgundy in color and after the initial rush of carbonation; there was little head to speak of. The beer looked cloudy in the wine glass, while little light coming through. The bouquet was rich and layered with aromas of fig, plum, raisin, toffee, chocolate, and maple. The malt also presented itself on the tongue as a sweet and warm taste reminiscent of port wine. Alcohol was not as well hidden as I though it would be, with distinct warmth that was pleasing. Not much to counter the sweetness, as there was hardly any hop presence. The beer was smooth and slippery on the palette with a prickly, peppery, and alcoholic aftertaste. Two years of aging was not enough, as the rough edges were still a little grating. Can do better with eight more years I think."
"750 ml bottle. This beer pours out a partially hazy brown color with a large head. The aroma is chocolate, licorice, spices, and dark fruits. The flavor is very malty, with chocolate, cherries, cloves, and pepper. There is some licorice flavor, but not as much as the aroma would have you believe. Hoppier than the average dark Belgian ale, but not overly hopped. The hops lend a welcomed bitterness to this otherwise sweet beer. Thick mouthfeel. Drinkability is good, considering this beer is so high in alcohol. This beer is good in the bottle, but it's excellent on tap."
"Ruby ruby red tawny brown with off-white edges and a big head of close-to-white foam. Head has good retention. Aromas are spicy and big with an alcoholic kick. Typically Belgian in its spice profile and clean biscuity maltiness and light hopping. This is a showcase for sweetness and spices and it shows. In a good way. The taste is a bit hot with this young example, but this is only a small hindrence. The spices mingle well with the clean malts and hops and the alcohol, whilst hot, is warming and pulls this one together. The mouthfeel is a bit oily for my liking, but it works, and the drinkability is nice for this 11% famed Belgian. He is a good emperor."
"Happy birthday to Charles the Fifth (Im four days early) and praise be to the Anker brewery of Mechelen! This bunch knows what they are doing. Too bad this masterpiece is only brewed once a year. Trying to pick apart the complexity of this ale nearly overloaded my neural circuitry, yet it is so smooth and well balanced that I can just as easily sit back and sip this to my hearts delight. Fine, Ill do just that."
"While this brew is thoroughly enjoyable, and not offensive at all for the abv, I couldn't drink more than a couple of these. That being said...this is a very unique brew.. unlike any other brew I have ever had of this style. If I was Charles V, I think I may have been a lush =D."
"Flavor is thick and syrupy in feel. Very sweet with hardly a hint of hops (I think I ma have noticed them towards the finish of the finish. Extremely sweet. Would make a wondeful dessert beer like a glass of port in Porto. Also got a bit of spiciness... some pepper and just a slight hint of coriander. Thick and full mouthfeel that was a bit cloying. Such a nice dessert wine."
"this is a fantastic brew. goddam"
"Quite drinkable for the alcohol content."
"Served in a snifter. Only about a 1/4 inch head on top, it dissipates speedily. The color is a deep brown/red or plum. Very cloudy. Somewhat bubbly. Smell is captivating with notes of wine, citrus fruits, honey, and alcohol. The taste is intense. Very strong malt flavors including rasins, candies, grapes, and brown sugar are present. Finish is strong and phenolic, and the alcohol rides a bit high. Has a rich feel with perfect carbonation. Very strong on malt, low on hops, its a slow sipper as the alcohol is not artfully hidden, but good nonetheless."
"¡Salud!"
"Drinkability - it's a beer dream come true. Worth keeping a few of these around for special occasions."
"d I would drink this again and again. Too expensive to be an everyday beer but I will enjoy this ale many more times."
"D- This is a nice smooth beer that has very good complexity although subtle. The dark sweet malts in the front are balanced by a dry light malt in the finish similar to that taste I get from a good fresh Kolsch. The alcohol is smooth but adds some character. My bottle says 8%ABV but it doesn't taste like that at all."
"Pours a rust-brown color, almost crimson with loads of foam that rests at the top of my glass and dissipates slowly leaving behind some lacing. Aromas of alcohol, plums, baked peaches, and melted sugar. The taste is just incredible with a blend of sweetness from different souces (various fruits, candy, etc.) that never overpowers but simply persists. Subtle spices and fruit flavors seem to pop up at different times. An elegant beer that exudes excellence and smoothness. The softness of this beers texture leaves a bit too be desired in the mouthfeel and aftertaste. However, the alcohol is well masked (seems more like a 7%-8% ABV) and the richness of the beer lends itself to be had again and again."
"Medium-high body."
"It had a nice sweet/chocolately taste but not overpowering or too syrupy. What a rich and complex beeer. I think they get better each year they release it and the older bottles get better with age as well."
"I have some friends that are almost religious when it comes to this beet. OK, it is a very fine Belgian ale, but not exceptional. Maybe it needs some more time to mature?"
"drinkability: one was it for me. couldn't finish the bottle. had this one in 2 sittings. very enjoyable. i will definitely be trying this one again in the newar future. it was an awesome compliment to my thanksgiving dinner. cheers!"
"Body is just huge, with a creamy thick texture that glides down your throat like warm butter. Delicious and perfect for dessert."
"Poured into a Rapscallion glass, formed a 1 1/2"" tan head above the bright burgundy brew. Headgrows for awhile, before settling down to drinkable levels after 10 minutes, with heavy foam lacing. Aroma is lightly spicy, with a banana sweetness . Taste is as good as the nose portended, with perhaps a little room for more flavor intensity, but I'm nit-picking. Mouthfeel is oh-so creamy and smooth, and drinkability is tremendous, especially for something of this abv. Just stupid drinkable. A brew fit for a king, in my book."
"I will go on record to say that this is the most exciting and complex brew I have ever had the pleasure of partaking. It is indeed a nectar of and for the gods, formulated and prepared with the utmost of love and respect, it is a rare opportunity that simply cannot be missed. Bravo!!"
"Dark brown color, very clear with a thick off-whiye head. The head leaves a nice lace as I drink the beer. Wonderful aroma of caramel, figs, sherry, and a little bit of mandarin orange. Theres just a little spice (cloves I believe) on the back end. The taste has a bit of toffee/pralines with more of the sherry. Orange and clove come across in the finish. Just a touch of alcohol heat. Full, mildly oily mouth feel. Good drinkability. Thanks so much to Jake of 33 who got this for me."
"D: Very easy to drink despite alcohol content. Don't know if I'd be able to polish off multiple bottles, but it's a wonderful beer that is wonderful in every aspect. Highly recommend!"
"Go grab one. Now!"
"I have never reviewed a beer as a perfect 5 before, and I do so with some trepidation. How can a beer be perfect? Can it not be improved upon? Questions that I don't take lightly. The only answer I can come up with is that this is simply the best beer I've ever had. Every aspect was perfect in my mind: sweetness, fruityness well blended alcohol, etc. This is the standard to which I'll hold all Quads and Belgian Strong Darks to. The bar is set."
"Definitely recomended."
"The drinkability is high on the ""would I try it again"" scale, but on the sessionability scale this scores very low. This stuff is hella strong... a sipper to the core of its very being. Quite savoury indeed."
"An opaque brown beer . Has a small egg shell white head and a little bit of lace. The aroma is a strong sweet dried fruit , figs, raisins and plums. There is a soft doughy aroma in the background with the alcohol. The taste is ful of dried fruit, some fig, then some raisin, some plum, then back to fig etc. All with a hint of tabacco at the back of the throat and a dry finish. I finisihed off the whole bottle while eating dinner . That is how easy drinking this is. A real treat. I Will Be Looking For More!"
"750 ml corked and bailed bottle. 2005 on neck label. $8 at Wine Warehouse in Charlottesville, VA. Label says 10% ABV."
"mouthfeel is somewhat slick, very full and kind of syrupy. not something I'm terribly excited about."
"If you like sweet dark Belgians this is a keeper"
"750ml bottled corked and caged with 2005 around the neck label. Dark and murky reddish brown with a quickly erupting tall light tan head. Great lacing was left as a tight cap of foam held together. Sweet ripe dark fruit really come on strong with a bit of caramel coating. Some mixed spices come out nicely as does a bit of yeast aroma. Big fruitiness starts off the flavor also with figs, raisins and plums covered with a bit of caramel and a light alcohol. Good spiciness and yeast flavor add to the complexity. Ends on a spicy sweet dark fruity note. Pretty thick body with a very creamy smooth texture to it, though I think a touch more thickness would be nice. Greatly drinkable as well. Overall a great fruity Belgian dark that is all around delicious."
"2002 Poured a hazy reddish brown color with no head or lacing. Aroma of apples, plums, cardamom, sweet caramel malt, chocolate, and some alcohol. Sweet malty, and spicy (cinnamon) taste with a dry, earthy finish. Light carbonation, and alcohol was noticed at the end."
"Well-rounded all the way through, this stuff whips the pony's ass, I could easily revert back from my hop-head ways for more of this malty goodness, I never knew it was ever made so well. Exceptional in its execution of its flavour profile, a limited edition, but I hope they make more along this line in the future, this is the alpha and omega of fine malty Belgian goodness. I've had hits and misses regarding Carolus, but this reaches the top of the mountain and lets off a shower of fireworks as far as what they are capable of producing. A deep bow to Phyl21ca for the trade, he is a gentleman for his good taste."
"Pours a ruby red color, with very little of a head. Nose is quite sweet, very raisiny. First sip is overpowering with it's sweetness! Deliicious malty flavor, with a strong, rumcake-type of flavor that goes down very easily. For 11% ABV the alcohol flavor is masked quite well. The complexity of flavors definitely improves as the beer warms from the fridge. The sugary flavor also makes this beer quite drinkable, which is a little scary for something packing such a punch!"
"Honestly though.... this beer is pure nirvana. I find it to be similar in flavor and character to Rochfort 12, but for some reason, I give the edge to the Cuvee Van De Keizer. Simply the best beer in the world. Unmatched in every category as far as I'm concerned!"
"Notes: We paired this beer with some chocolates from Belgium including Galler Lait (bar), Cote D'or Lait with hazelnuts (bar), Callebaut Lait (bar), Demaret Lait bar, and Demaret Lait assorted pralines. The Galler bar was by far the best pairing with this beer but the Demaret chocolates (from Verviers) were the best all around chocolate and would go well with any beer that matches well with chocolate. I recommend pairing this beer with good Belgian chocolate."
"This is simply one of the greatest beer I've ever consumed. I was looking through the coolers at Naja's in Redondo Beach and was deciding between a saison and a grand cru. Jason the owner suggested this is a perfect nightcapper BOY WAS HE RIGHT!!! Pour is so silky just like the mouthfeel it curls its way around every taste bud. some chocolaty/fruity aroma's. A full flavored boquet ready for gobbling. I just about fell of my bar stool after the first drink I was so impressed (or buzzed). Nutty up front with a malty/rich body that finishes sweet/Fruity with a slight bitter cleansing. I don't know how they could improve this beer as it is fit for an emperor. I will now go on a quest to get one of my local stores to order a case for me. I will beg, barter, bribe."
"Overall an extremely drinkable beer that I highly recommend."
"Wow, this must be the smallest 750ml bottle ever. It seems like I just cracked it and now its gone! Good sized cap of off white head and a dark burgundy body with good lacing. Sweet fruity aroma with just a touch of alcohol sneaking in. Flavor is sweet with dark fruits and little bitterness. Alcohol is noticable in effect, but not taste. Amazing. If it wasn't $9.50 a bottle I could drink this all night!"
"I have a new favorite belgian. Do your soul a favor and get a bottle of this ASAFP!!!!"
"Had this on-tap at Roman's Pub. Poured a very dark brown with a small off-white head. Smells like ripe, almost overripe fruit, cherries, and kind of like licorice. Also smells faintly spicy, and with a deep breath you can smell the 11% alcohol. Tastes intensely of Twizzlers licorice. The alcohol becomes more apparent as it warms. Very thick, coating mouthfeel. One of the most interesting beers I've ever had, and one of the best."
"Taste was all malt, caramel, sweet, raisiny with hints of dried fruits. It was full bodied yet smooth and danced on the tongue slightly leaving a nice alcohol warmth in the stomach. Very nice beer indeed."
"As for drinkability, I think after a while, the sweetness would become cloying, and the alcohol would knock your dick in the dirt, but overall, a very fine brew! Kind of reminds me of Kasteel."
"Tasted side by side with a bottle of the Classic Carolus, this is clearly just a bumped up version of the standard that might include better malts (perhaps some Munch malts) and a longer, cooler fermentation and maturation period. They are very much the same beer, but this one is much more nicely done. It's thoroughly enjoyable, and as it can age at least 3 years, I'd highly suggests you grab a few bottles and pull one out during special occassions each year. I can easily see this working with a Thanksgiving dinner (before, during, or after), or as a toasting beer during the holiday season. It will work with numerous food pairings, including glazed pork chops, BBQ ribs, and char-grilled steak. Highly recommended!"
"Pours the color of fine cognac with a large bubbly head, plenty of lacing, and fountains of carbonation. Nose is bread soaked dark fruits with some alcohol. Taste is a delicious blend of citrus, malt, raisins, cough syrup, and bing cherries. It's a beer sangria, only with a wonderfully full mouthfeel. This big beer goes down smoother than a lot of lighter brews. This is a personal favorite."
"Nice beer that certainly made a great choice after dinner. Fairly complex and alcoholic, nice brew either way you look at it."
"What a rich rich beer. Reminded me of eating a rich chocolate cake. Very yummy and a beer I wouldnt hesitate substituting for or including with a rich dessert."
"Taste is a bit sweeter than I expected. At least in the beginning. The middle and end give way to more of the chocolate and sugar as well as a slight alcohol note. Overall a wonderful beer. I would love to try any of their other beers as well."
"Total Respect."
"Definately worth a try. I payed $9 for the 750mL bottle and I'd consider doing it again."
"Not too shabby at all. A beer worth looking up again for this dude."
"Excellent strong dark ale. Poured from a 750ml into a goblet. 2005 vintage. Nice, lasting head. Aromas of fruit, some spiciness. Taste is quite intense and complex. Pretty sweet, rich, malty, some ripe fruits, spices and alcohol are present. A touch of port wine perhaps also. Mouthfeel is full and rich. Drinkability is limited only by the intensity and alcohol content. I feel as though this beer could benefit from some signifiant cellaring to mellow the beer and make it a bit more subtle. Still, an excellent beer when fresh. Drink some now, save some for later."
"750ml 2004 edition. Sampled April 2005. Pours a deep cloudy brown with small tan head which diminishes quickly and leaves light lace. Smells of sweet candi malts, dark fruit, and vinous alcohols. Tastes quite sweet. Lots of sticky malt sweetness on aged, port wine-like base. Slightly dry and yeasty finish. Quite syrupy in the mouth, with only a slight prickle of carbonation. Not a bad beer by any means, but too sweet for my palate and lacking any significant layers of complexity."
"Now this is waht I call a beer. Absolutely wonderful. It poured a nice ruby color with a fizzy beige head. The smell was of caramel and wood. The flavor provided incredible complexity yet wonderful balance. Wood, caramel, fruit, and so much more combine into one of the better tasting beers I've ever had. You absolutely have to try this."
"I have a picture of myself and three other friends standing under a train depot sign in Belgium. The sign reads, 'Mechelen'. And to think that the first time I ever had this beer was, in Scranton, Pa., three months after coming home from Europe. Hopefully, I will tour Europe again this year. I have got to try this, if available, in it's home town. I had this on tap after the keg traveled 3500 miles and it was incredible. I can only imagine how good it must be in Belgium. This brew IS fit for a king! Complex, to say the least. Banana, brown sugar, vanilla, homemade bread, plum, sweet, and malty. A very light head sits on top of the lightly carbonated reddish/brown liquid and laces till the very end. As with most Belgian browns, I took my time and let it warm a bit. The taste and the aroma just explode. One sip yielding banana, the next, maybe some rum and so on, till the very end. The high abv isn't really hidden in this one but your taste buds and olfactory glands are working overtime, leaving little time to worry about alcohol. After two half liter chalices, I was ready to call myself king. Instead I called the bartender and had one more. I gave this a 4.5 on drinkability only because of it's sweet taste. (It's similar to a Kasteel Brune a far as sweetness.) That, not the 11% abv, only prevented me from having anymore than I did at one sitting. I went back a few days later only to learn that the Carolus had kicked. Since their tap stock is rotated I will have to wait some time before they have this on tap again. Maybe, until I get back to Europe. This one though, is worth the wait."
"I would accept purgatory for this one, a truly masterful preparation and clearly one of the best brews I have ever tasted!"
"Beautiful looking beer, Brownish/mahogany with little light showing through, tan coloured head that is dense and pillowy. The head eventually degrades to delicate lacing around the rim of the glass. An absolute smorgasbord of aromas are immediately detectable. Dark malt, plum, raisin, licorice, apricot. All of this rides a yeasty undercurrent. The flavors are layered and seem to come in waves. Toffee, prune, brown sugar, spice, dark rye bread, plum, yeast, milk chocolate, orange rind. Full bodied, with seemingly mild carbonation. Beutiful for sipping, though I would certainly pair this with some big cuts of beef, game, barbecue, and really strong cheeses. There was a slight cloying character that I took off points for, though I think If I let this age for a year or two it would have been 5's across the board. Stellar stuff!"
"Huge plume subsides to an active, fine mesh of lightly singed matrix. Impressive, succulent mahogany hue that is quite deep and cant be penetrated. Plum and raisins are huge on nose with an acidic malt tinge and red licorice thrown in  aroma is quantifiable nine inches away. Molasses sweetness with a juniper hit and a port-like front that is blasted through with a pile driver of malty alcohol that subsides quite neatly. This seems to be so much more complex than others in style, and that much more enjoyable."
"Drinkability: Very good but a bit too sweet to drink several of. Also, the $18 I paid for one 750 will prevent me from drinking as much of this as I would like."
"Woozy, laden with sweet incense, it is undrinkable now. All indications are that this will drink better in decades to come."
"Beer is good. Happy beering."
"This one pours a dark brown with a good, tan head that that is slow to fade. The carbonation is high and it continues in sheets of bubbles long after the pour. The aroma is heavy in overripe and dried fruits with a noticeable alcohol presence. The body is very sweet, almost cloying and heavy in the overripe bananas and raisins. Perhaps it woudl be a tad better if it were dried out a touch, but its possible the alcohol would be too strong and unbalance the beer that way."
"2003 Bottle: Poured a rusty and cloudy amber ale with a medium brown head with surprisingly great retention. Aroma is quite port-like sweet with strong malt also noticeable. Taste is sweeter then expected and I was glad I drank this after dinner since the sweetness would have been too overpowering before a meal. Body is quite full and alcohol is not discernable which I always appreciate. Overall, I would say that this si another great beer from a sometime underappreciated brewery  I very much appreciated the creamy, fruit/sweetness of this one."
"The only bad thing about this beer was the fact that there where other people who had to share it... (very selfish I know but it was really tasty...) At 11% or whatever it is you couldn't get through too many but all the better to let it age I suppose..."
"2003 corked and caged 750ml bottle, pours deep cloudy reddish-brown, foamy tan head that lasts and clings to the sides of my glass, sweet malty, chocolate and brown sugar aroma. Dark chocolate, fruity and yeasty flavors, full body, perfect creamy mouthfeel, finishes sweet. This is an awesome ale."
"2004-Corked and caged 750ml. Paid 8.99 for this at Yankee Spirits in Sturbridge MA. Deep mahogony with reddish hints with some light peaking through.One finger tan head that settled fairly quickly.The nose was a generous amount of malted cherries.Quite a full mouthfeel with strong carbonation felt on the tongue.Taste is somewhat alcholic, sweet, creamy, and fruity.Pear and cherries definately come through.This beer kind of reminded me of Three Philosophers in smell and taste, which is not a bad thing.Watch out for this one the 10% abv while tasted is still fairly well hidden."
"Just finished a bottle of the 2003 vintage. This is very dark brew, full of sweetness, dried fruits, nuts, and malty goodness. This is big beer. The alcohol is obvious on the nose and tongue, which accounts for my 4.0 rating on drinkability. Otherwise, the presentation, pour, and overall experience are excellent. This is something to save for a special time."
"Damn, what an outstanding beer! The flavors effortlessly meld togther for a singularly wonderful drinking experience. This Grand Cru is just about prefect. You have to be in the mood for sweet but I can't think of many nicer liquid desserts than this. Very highly recommended!"
"Deep, murky looking burgandy tone. Thin cream of light brown coloring tops the brew. Retention is adequate. Lacing more than sufficient. Aroma is quite pleasant. Notes of yeast, candy, musty, raisin, rum and fruitbread. Palate follows suit. Boozy rum cake. Raisins, dates... Sweet candy tones. A nice unassuming body and mouthfeel. Light and airy. This is a beer I'd return to, although I'm not sure if it'll be available again soon."
"pours a dark brown and unasuming. Smells deep, dark and malty. Aromas of caramel, tobacco and leather. The taste is deep malt, spicey, sweet, but not sugary. Caramel flavors dominate with very little alcohol, despite the 10% abv. Wow, drink slowly and enjoy, this is a dark, enjoyable beer. I highly recommend it"
"This beer poured a dark brown-orange color. The head was slight and looked tan and slightly green. Head left a nice ring about the glass and left some lacing. Smell was a melange of fruit, chocolate, and roasted malt. Taste was overall very sweet and was composed of chocolate and fruit with a hint of spice. Mouthfeel was smooth and rich. This was a wonderful beer, but, in the end, the sweetness proved to be overpowering."
"Many thanks to StevieW for the sample!"
"Had a 2002 8 years later and it really mellow and gave forth dark fruit. Smooth."
"The beer pours a very dark brown color with a 1/4"" tan head that fades to lacing. The aroma is great. It has a warm and spicey scent that boasts of a complex crystal malt arrangement and fruity Belgian yeast. The taste is great as well. It has a very smooth and sweet crystal malt flavor that goes down easy and warms a little on the finish. It is sweet with malts and a fruity on the aftertaste; very mellow and flavorful. The mouthfeel is good. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a damn fine brew and an excellent drinker. It has everything that I look for in a beer: good aroma, complexity, and mouthfeel."
"750mL bottle poured into a snifter. It pours a murky brown color with two fingers of head. The smell is sweet and has a touch of tart cherry to it. The taste is very malty, slightly sweet with more overripe cherry and other dark fruit coming through. A little bit of spice on the finish. The mouthfeels is very nice, thick and heavy, yet smooth. The drinkability is good as well for an 8% brew. Nicely done."
"This beer poured a dark brown color with a large tan head that died off quickly and left very little lacing on the glass. The aroma was fruity, with orange being the most upfront and there was a yeasty spice as well. The flavor had a nice Belgian spice character and an orange citrus flavor. Caramel and other malts give it a nice body and flavor. Seems just a tad thin, but very enjoyable."
"2003 edition. This poured a dark brown/tea color wtih one finger of head that falls to a ring around the top of the beer. The nose is sweet cherries and sweet caramel, good malties. The taste reflects the smell, with some cherry and caramel notes. The feel is relatively thick and the drinkability is good, easy drinking on this beer. Overall a good find."
"This brew is carbonated cognac; Excellent."
"Thick, light cocoa colored, head faded quickly to a film island. Opaque mahogany colored beer. Fairly strong aroma of dark candy sugar, alcohol, and plum. Lots of interesting flavor, some sweet caramel and vanilla, it's got that barrel aged creamy alcohol flavor even though it's probably never touched a barrel. Feel is kind of slick up front but dries out towards the end, definitely a good thing. A full bodied beer that leaves your stomach warm. Besides the dissapointing head (snicker) this beer is great, a big beer with a delicious flavor and inviting aroma."
"The sweetness is not cloying, just nice. Alcohol makes it's presence know, but is not overpowering and does not keep this from being decently drinkable. This is damn good stuff!"
"Pours a deep ruby highlighted brown with a very minimal beige head in an authentic little Gouden Carolus ""Cuvee of the Emperor"" 5.5 oz. chalice. Pruney like fruit smells; medicinal and dark roasted malt and candi sugar aromas, too. The taste is equally pruney and medicinal, how I'd like my Geritol to be when and if I get to that stage in life :). Light chocolate reminiscence as it warms. Slight sweet/sour finish. Lower carbonation level is perfect for a ""nightcap"" type of beer that this is. Mouthfeel is nice, slick on the tongue. I'm glad this beer was only served 5.5 oz. at a time, because 12 oz. would have taken me too long to drink."
"Overall an interesting spin on a Belgian dark, leaning towards a holiday brew with its intense spiciness, even though the nose is more like the complexity of a port."
"Oh, wow, this is good. goodness upon goodness, tasty to the max...I haven't said yum yet, but it'll come in handy here!"
"Enjoy."
"Whenever I cook a good steak, this is the first beer I want to grab out of my cellar. I try to keep this stocked at all times."
"I enjoyed this Carolus greatly. It poured a ruby color with a tannish head and lots of lacing. The aroma was heavenly with lots of sweet malt and some fruitiness. The taste was an amalgam of sweet malt, spices, and fruit with just a hint of hops and alcohol at the end. The spices appeared to be some sage and perhaps basil with some citrus fruitiness. The beer is a nice thick bodied beer with a lingering sweetness that is very pleasant, but drunk in too much quantity could become cloying. The alcohol also contributes to feeling done with the one bottle."
"Pours muddy, dark amber/brown. Saw some red at the end of the glass as well. Volumous white head boils down to a small cap. Malt aroma is like a dark and wet forest - woodsy. Alcohol scent present, with some noticeable yeasty sweet aromas. The taste is initially fruity yeast that is very light on the tongue due to the incredible carbonation. Alcohol is present thoughout, with a woodsy flavor appearing. No bitterness - hops hardly discernable. The aftertase is smooth, light and malty. Mouthfeel is strongly malt and especially yeast emphasized - a chewy intricate brew! Enjoyable."
"Murky, chestnut red in hue with strong brown influences, the color has great depth and is very attractive. A smallish beige head reached a sad half finger in height, the head retention was poor and it quickly dissipated to a sparse, bubbly cap. The subsequent lacing was almost zilch. This aspect of the beer is disappointing. The nose is awesome, great potency, alcoholic black licorices upfront, supple warm maltiness follows, lots of plums and soft grape notes, figs, raisins, a bit of raw rubbing alcohol too but it is largely rounded and blended perfectly with a yeasty spice. Im in love with the nose, there is so much going on yet every aroma has a voice and I like what it is saying. It is time to drink-up! Upfront the palate is momentarily empty, I could sense the flavor sensation ready to explode but for a brief moment there was anticipation, a pause, it was like Christmas morning as a kid. Man, I knew this was going to be good! And then it happened, I swallowed this nectar and I finally tasted it! At first it was very peppery, clovey, green grape skins, citrus zest, rubbing alcohol, a bit of spiced rum, juicy maltiness, and caddied sugar. This beer is just a puppy, it has bite and it could use some maturing but I really like it as is. I do think the mouthfeel is a little too empty; it is a little over-carbonated yet I cant downgrade it that much. Maybe I am nitpicking. This is a lovely beer, very drinkable and very wantable; I bought a 750ml corked-and-caged bottle in Lincoln a few months ago. Sadly, the last time I checked there was no more. Damn. If you see it, buy it, and then enjoy it. Recommended."
"Dark ruby color light biege outer ring of a head. Sweet candi sugar and malt sweetness in the nose. Taste of sweet port, raisens, plum, and corriander, and a finish that has a dry touch of white pepper. Lively mouth upfront mellows to a coating thinner but smooth mouth. A nice sippin beer and one to drink with a good steak."
"2000 Vintage in 2004. After 4 years this beer was very alive with a nice fizz and a great nose of ripe bananas and malt. The color was a radiant red with a brown blended in. The taste was like a light abbey ale - light in the body but still good in the taste. The taste was good but fleeting. As it warmed the flavors of raisins and honey malt come through much better. For the vintage dating this was a bit disappointing as age did not really improve it."
"This beer came in a beautiful bottle, so it must be their major holiday promotion. This beer poured a reddish amber color and formed a small light tan bubbly head that coated the glass with lace as it subsided. A medium amount of carbonation is present. An aroma of malt, cherries, vanilla and a hint of chocolate. The flavor was of malt, chocolate with a warming aspect of the alcohol present. The finish was sweet yet slightly sprite. The body was not as heavy as others of this style. Aging would probably help this one."
"2002 Vintage - I has cellared this particular beer for a little over a year and it has made a huge difference in it. Its cloudy, dark-ruby color is not much to look at, but that is the worst part of it. The aroma has vanilla, oak, and maple in the nose. The taste has more of the same plus other complexities. It is very smooth and finishes mellow. I wish there were more of these in my cellar."
"Chimay chalice, close to room temp From a ruby brown body mounted with a fully diminishing big light brown head emanes a powerful sweet aroma. Ultra-sweet in fact, full of red licorice flavours, almost too much for its own good, but decadent nevertheless. Quite spicy as well as you'd expect from a belgian grand cru (herbal thyme and sage), lots of fruits (orange, lemon peel). Just a big malty nose altogether with restrained dusty yeastiness. As it warms, it acquires a powdery chocolate feel as well. In mouth, it's still very sweet, with more alcohol than I expected, vious candi sugar. Lots of malty flavours to decorticate: mint, grapes, orange with floral qualities... Aftertaste is long and made me think of a banana split with touches of alcohol and licorice. A complex beer, definitely a sipper with this big medium-thick body and a low carbonation level. A dessert by itself."
"Pours a ruddy reddish-brown with a dense tan head that recedes after a few minutes. Aroma is simply sweet, with a hint of spicy alcohol. Taste is much more mellow than I remember, although I have only previously had this beer in the smaller, 12 oz. bottle. Mostly sweet apple and light caramel with just a hint of acidic bitterness. A small piece of ""Red Delicious"" Apple with the peel, dipped in caramel... Mouthfeel is medium-bodied and drinkability is very good, when considering the 8% abv."
"A beer that dont come around often,pours a deep brown with some reddish tints with to be expected a hug rocky head.Aroma is of spiced cherries and alcohol,taste is spices and of dried fruit(cherries) and ginger-like and the alcohol really comes thru as it warms.It would be tough to finish a bottle of this brew but it is very appetizing to say the least."
"The predominant smell and taste is of alcohol. But what else does this beer offer? Not much. The taste was bland and lacked complexity. I couldn't make out much flavor, just the taste of alcohol. The aftertaste was stale. This one is only brewed once a year, on February 24. Why all the fuss? There's nothing special here. This one is unworthy of the great Belgian suds tradition."
"2003 corked bottle. Cork explodes out. BE CAREFUL. This is a monster of a beer, not for the faint of heart. Currents, prunes and figs in the nose. sweet with very present alcohol. silky, oily mouthfeel. Tastes kind of bready. Lots of fruit. Makes you want to sip and try more to explore the complex flavors and layers of intrigue. would go well with hearty meats and dessert"
"Screw eggnog; give me this at Christmas time!"
"This is quite good, very rich and a definite brew to savor. Could perhaps use something to balance the sweetness and fruitiness; maybe some Belgian yeast complexity or some off-setting spice notes. This beer is very smooth, with no harsh components despite the high alcohol."
"Unbelieveable!"
"750cl Corked bottle dated 2002. Label has a blue banner reading ""Grand Cru of the Emperor"". Poured a hazy firey reddish amber color with a thick head which reduced in size quickly. Aroma is a malty fruity one with notes of caramel and vanilla. Has a sugary brandy like quality as well in the nose. Mouthfeel is full and velvety smooth with a crisp finish that couldn't be better. Flavor is fruity and delicious with sweet candy sugar and yeast creating a complex and flavorful ale. The 2 years of aging has served this ale well. Alcohol is unnoticible and flavors are pronounced and soft. Nice Belgian!"
"I just tried this again six months later and am upping my review. It has opened up a bit more. It still has an amazing array of ripe fruit, but it's not quite as overwhelming as it was at the beginning of the year. This may be one of my top 5 beers by '05."
"This one does improve with age  so get two if you havent tried it, and thank me later for that advice. Ill be back to this one in a years time."
"Thanks to Pabobcat!"
" This is an excellent beer on those gulps where the alcohol is kept in check. The flavor, aroma, and drinkability would be better if it were hidden more. I found that once it sit in my glass a bit, the alcohol spice died down a bit. Very nice."
"Update - I had a 2010 in 2010 just to test my theory that Grand Crus are really just cellared BSDAs and I think I proved my point. This is smooth, well-aged, with even some musty characters, and is incredibly drinkable after just a few months in the bottle."
"Dangerously tasty. My first Grand Cru and something I'd drink again without much thought..."
"Sampled at From The Vine monthly beer tasting Oct 13th, 2003: 2003 Bottle: Dark ruby/amber with a medium beige head and nice lacing. Aroma of plum, malt, caramel and banana. Fairly rich and complex with a nice vinous blend of fruit (apple mostly), malt, chocolate and a little alcohol. The finish is sweet and lingering. Definitely worth getting again."
"This one is stated Gouden Carolus Grand Cru of the Emperor (pretty high accomplishment if you ask me). But this didn't quite live up to its self proclaimed greatness. Pours a muddy reddish brown color with basically no head and little lacing. Lots of floating yeast sediment in the beer. But the nose on it is terrific. Lots of sweet maltiness. The initial taste backs up the nose. Plums and raisins combined with a hit of sharp carbonation. But this follows with a buttery diacetyl taste that starts out nice but eventually becomes too sharp and ends up tasting like scotch. Finish is dry and yeasty with some more raisiny sweetness and it lingered for a long, long time. Good, but I couldn't drink too many of these. I would definitely age this one if I get it again."
"Gouden Carolus Grand Cru of the Emperor: Kind of a fancy pants name for a beer that I did not think was all that good. Big bomber bottle marked 2000 around the neck ring. Corked bottle. When pouring, I quickly noted substantial chunks of sediment, and this beer poured into somewhat of an unappetizing murky reddish brown color, with not much head. It did taste better than it looked, with predominant tastes of dried fruits, raisons prunes, etc. I did sense a tiny taste of sourness that was not all that unpleasant. All in all, Id pass."
"Bottled 2002. Murky chestnut brown hue. Creamy beige head with homogenously sized bubbles. Intricate webs of lace remain. Vinous waft of sherryish fruit upfront in aroma tapers, allowing sugary dark caramel and clove to emerge. Hint of must and butter. Mellow banana esters surface as the beer breathes. Functional, but not overly enticing aromawise. Mild honey like sweetness hits the palate initially, then yields to a bitterish melange of bread crust and powdered baker's chocolate. Sweetness then resumes, this time of a clean, molasses tinged dark caramel nature. Herbal, clove phenol appears late, and detracts from the malt character, which had almost developed into a rich, carob undertone. Lightly bodied and well attenuated, but the paltry hop bitterness leaves overall balance well skewed towards malt sweetness. Finishes with a snap of clove laced sweetness, but otherwise dry and clean. It's certainly a flavorful brew, but residual and caramel malt derived sweetness clashed somewhat with the phenols, thus preventing greatness. This bottle was quite young. Definitely a beer worthy of cellaring."
"While this is decent, and somewhat interesting, a few critical flaws keep this from being anything special."
"The beer pours a bemused cherry red color, the head prodigious, creamy in its texture, the lace fine sheets to cling to the glass. Nose is malt, ripe cherry sweet, hints of fusel alcohol, also present to this old nose. Front is sweetly malt; the top is middling in feel. Finish is potently acidic with the hops being apropos to the style, quite dry aftertaste. The high ABV, warms the tummy, and adds that just right character to the beer. I could not wait to sample this beer, but I have two more to age away as recommended. It will certainly improve with age, as I think it needs to mellow a bit, which what a year or two in the cellar will do."
