"Dark reddish-brown pour with thin tan head. Smells of raisins, toast, and alcohol. Heavy fruit flavor with some alcohol, but finishes pretty clean. What’s left is a nice malty lingering aftertaste."

"Overall: This is drinking like a dream.  Toffee, vanilla, dark fruits, and rye bread all come together to create a heck of a drinking experience.  Well done Green Flash."
"O - An awesome Grand Cru.  Green Flash always impresses.  Glad to finally find this one.  They don't ship it to GA for reasons unknown."

"Green Flash's Grand Cru pours a dark brown with tan head that forms into a tight beaded foam that seems to not go away with little lacing on the glass. Smell of brown sugar, dates, apples, and a hint of black licorice. Taste is nice with brown sugar and candy malts up front, a light licorice taste on the back, light herbal spice and mild hop bitterness on the aftertaste. All in all a good beer, but as a Grand Cru the hops are a bit too pronounced. Better on tap from recollections. Cheers."

"O - Green Flash seems to be at the top of their game when producing west coast IPA's and PA's. This beer is fairly well balanced, but just forgettable."

"My brother in law brought this one over and I decided to give it a go, I had no idea what to expect as I did not really know what it was, but the two Green Flash beer I have had I enjoyed so I figured here we go. I was very pleasantly surprised, the look and smell of this beer had me very optimistic. Definitely rocking the Belgian which had me look closer and realized that it was 9.1%. The flavor was also outstanding and it hides the ABV very well. Overall a very good beer that I hope to have again."

"Malty and spiced yeasty Dark Strong Ale. Interesting that it feels like it I poured a Belgian and American brew to the same glass. A bit cloying though, given its sweetness, this is in theory appropriate to the style."

"Pours a reddish brown with more than two fingers of beige head that dissipated at a slow but steady pace. The nose is bready with the hint of dark fruits. The flavor profile is malty, but the entire offering is on the thin side. The finish is pleasantly dry."
"This is very good and my opinion is that each bottle is vastly different, especially with age."
""
""
""
""
""

"O - Another reason Green Flash has become a regular for me. This has a lot of great flavors that I find well balanced. To some it might be cloyingly sweet, but for me, the hops were enough to cut it."
"overall - even though this style typically benefits from aging, I'd advise to drink yours fresh."
""
"O: Yeast character is pleasant. Candi sugar comes through a lot. Not a bad offering, bit the flavors are very distinct and separate. It really doesn't come together as I'd like it to."
"Mahogany brown in color with a light head that does not cover the whole top of the beer. I get some raisins and figs in the aroma along with some caramel tones. It's a bit thick in the mouth and you can tell there's alcohol. You get some serious sweetness in the flavor with hints of raisins,caramel,and molasses."

"this comes in four packs now, a rich malty brown ale type, with maybe a little more malt complexity, but rather straightforward for a grand cru, a meaningless word in beer. chocolate brown on the pour with a rising tide of tan foam with little volcanic geothermal sort of bubbling on the surface of the head. the nose is alcoholic and sweet, with just a hint of Belgian yeast in there. immediately I notice its not as hoppy as all green flash beers usually are, but it is indeed well hopped. the yeast does a good job limiting the sweetness in the flavor, but the grains themselves don't provide a ton of flavor. its rather muted, and the roast and chocolate malt flavors are barely there. instead I get yeast and booze, two things I really like, but this beer is kind of missing its middle. the finish is bitter from the hops, and it cleans up the palate well. nice feel though, well carbonated and smooth and rich medium body. its simple as they go, maybe not as enjoyable as some other green flash beers, but not a bad beer. overpriced at 12 or 13 bucks a four pack though."

"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 10/30/2012. Pours lightly cloudy dark reddish brown color with a 2 finger dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of raisin, fig, plum, pear, caramel, toast, chocolate, clove, pepper, dark candi sugar, dark bread, light roast, light banana, floral, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark malt and fruity/spicy yeast notes; with good strength. Taste of raisin, fig, plum, pear, caramel, chocolate, clove, pepper, toast, dark candi sugar, dark bread, light roast, light banana, herbal, floral, and yeast earthiness. Lingering notes of dark fruit, caramel, toast, chocolate, clove, pepper, dark bread, dark candi sugar, herbal, floral, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Nice complexity/balance and solid robustness of dark malt and fruity/spicy yeast flavors; with a nice malt/spiciness balance and no cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, crisp, and lightly slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very good Belgian dark ale. Good balance and complexity of malt and yeast ester flavors; and smooth to sip on for the big ABV. A nicely enjoyable offering."

"Mouthfeel is thickish and slightly sticky. Overall, this is a pretty good beer."

"O - Having a hard time with this. Perhaps a bad bottle. Even for a whiskey the ash tray taste and finish would be barely tolerable."

"Overall Its ok but probably wouldn't buy again"
"Pours a dark brown, much like a brown ale. The smell is decent, I'm prepared for some dried fruit, maybe prunes and dates. The taste is pretty smooth with a good blend of fruit. Definitely some plum or prunes of some sort but not overpowering. It's a nice drink with a good finish. Not something I'd want a lot of but for what it is its pretty good. I'd definitely like to try again."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This really drinks like an American Barleywine in both taste and mouthfeel. I actually like it quite a bit, but am deducting for style. From now on, Ill stick to Belgian for my Belgium's. Certainly worth a try, but dont expect a BSDA."
""
""
""
""
"O This is a hard style to attempt given the hundreds of years of collective experience that you're up against. The beer itself is pretty good, but it is not what one expects given the brewery's description. A very hop-forward interpretation of the style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: More malts wouldn't be a bad thing. That's really the only thing holding it back. I went in not knowing what to expect and was pleasantly surprised. While this is not the best Green Flash beer I've had it's worth picking up a single to try. Paired really nicely with some English Seaside Cheddar."
""

"Overall: this brew might need a little tweaking but I will take it the way it is. Honestly for your buck it feels more like a steal....this brew plus a glass and you're good. Salud!"

"It's a decent Belgian that I would buy again, but a bit pricey."

"O: I'm a hophead and this is a cool beer for me. Unlike many other Belgian dark ales, this lacks some of the sweetness and throws in some hoppiness that is a bit unexpected. The taste could be a little bit more robust and sweet."

"O: good but not the best I've had. there are others in the style that I prefer around the same price point. the nose is great and the flavors are good but it kind of falls off mid taste and never picks itself up again until the swallow."
""
""
""
""
"This beer really hits the palate with soapy Belgian spices and earthy flavors, very phenol heavy. Really not for me flavor-wise, I've been really sensitive to metallic flavors in some beers lately. Quite a different take on a Belgian strong ale. Happy for the chance to try this one though."
""
""
"This isn't a bad beer at all. It has much of what I look for in this style; dark fruit notes balanced with funky, spicy Belgian yeast. If I were to have complaints it would be that this beer doesn't have a rich maltiness that I desire and I find it to be a bit crisp. Otherwise, I thought this was a nice take on the style."
"Dark brown pour with a half inch or so of foamy off-white head; moderate retention and lacing. Caramel malts in the nose, stone fruits and a bit of citrus. Sweet malts taste, dried fruits, candied citrus zest, some herbal hoppiness. Medium body. A pleasant drink overall."
"This Grand Cru's American-ized technique causes the beer to taste and feel slightly barleywine-ish but with the phenol-ester balance of Belgian versions. It's creamy and rich rather than racy and dry, making this type of taste and texture familiar with American-brewed Belgian-style ales."
""
"Pours a hazy dark orange with a foamy beige head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Foamy rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, brown sugar, spices, and dark fruits. Taste is much the same with a hoppy flavor on the finish. There is a mild amount of spice and hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that is pretty tasty but has a better smell in my opinion."

"M- Smooth. Not strongly carbonated. Seems kind of light for such a dark beer."
""
""
""

"The nose was big and boozy. Bourbon, rum, raisin, and malts. The taste was similar , boozy, dark fruits, warm banana bread, with some nice spice added in. Medium to low carbonation. Mouth feel was in the middle. Overall: I didn't like this in the beginning but as the beer warmed up, I warmed up to it or may be it was the ABV? Either way I was happy when it was all done. Put this in a snifter with a fine cigar and your in like the butchers dog."
"I'm not crazy about the taste, but everything else is right on. I'm a huge fan of Green Flash, but this isn't a winner like most of their beers, in my opinion."
""
"Whereas the aroma is subtle and played down the taste erupts with dark sweet malts and yeast up front and then a biting but still low to moderate bitterness pulling up the rear. Mellow to bold in one motion. Kind of interesting and likable."
""
"Poured into a 13 oz tulip glass, bottle dated 11/06/12. Pours a brownish red,with a three inch light tan head, that dissipates quickly, leaving plenty of lace behind. Smell is powerful, banana, clove, brown sugar, and dark fruit. Taste is all of that, that just as pu pungent as the nose, banana and clove up front with some sweat brown sugar and rum soaked raisins in the finish. Body is medium large, enough carbonation for the style, a little dry, and goes down easy enough. This isn't my favorite style, but I like this beer. Excellent example of the style."
"O- Average at best. Very dissapointing when compared to most GF brews. I wish they'd get they're act together on this one. I had such high hopes."
"Poured into a tulip glass. Pours dark reddish brown with an off-white head. Some ruby light is visible along the bottom of the glass. There are visible tiny bubbles rising in the beer. A ring of lacing is left where the head once was when the head dissipates and a thin film remains atop the beer. This lacing also travels down the glass as the beer is consumed. There are aromas of bready malt with fruity esters. I get banana and bubble gum as well as some spiciness. Bready malt, fruit, and spice hit the tongue on the first sip, masking the 9% alcohol very well. The fruit notes are dark fruits like raisin along with some banana. It has a really solid malt backbone. There's some hop bitterness on the back end. The body is medium to full with moderate carbonation. This beer is dangerously easy to drink and finishes slightly dry. This is an excellent beer."

"Update: tried on draft yesterday, and it lacks a lot of character. Was dominates by floral hops, had little malt or yeast character, and was decidedly bitter. Wouldn't drink it again."
""
""
""
""
"This tastes like a Belgian mixed with a smokey porter, fare enough it's interesting but I don't think it works all that great."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Not a bad beer at all, but not quite as polished as other Green Flash creations. Still, a drinkable brew."
"Body on the grand cru is on the lighter side of full with a light carbonation for the countries style, I was expecting more bubbles, it kinda dulled the taste a bit, or perhaps this should lay down a bit, but what i tasted today, i would not risk aging any bottles. I struggled to get through the bottle and will be keeping my dollars with Rayon Vert"

"- It is a big brew, and does contain some lovely esters and dark fruit in the flavor. For me many Green Flash beers are just too heavy and thick with the caramel malts. This one is quite sweet which I can't say I like rather well. I like more dry, less sweet, and more bready in a grand cru.. which isn't really a style in its own, but most often a blend, or mixed bag even. If a big Green Flash fan... worth a shot. Like sweet? Worth a shot. But otherwise, I wouldn't buy it again."
""
""
"O: It's a rather unique Belgian ale. I would recommend picking up if you find it. I like the transition from fruity esters to a clean roasted malt finish."

"It's a shame. Green Flash brews some of my all time favorites, but this one is a miss."
""
""
"I thought this fully lived up to the name. Poured a 1.5"" velvety beige head which lasted quite a long time. Dark burnt umber brown body. The smell struck me as soon as I popped the top. Roasted malt, caramel, honey, and hops. The taste is rich with maybe the most dark chocolate I've had in a beer which didn't directly add it as an ingredient as well as complex roasted malts. Taste is also sweeter than most beers so I'd call this one a dessert. Fairly long slow burn finish. All in all a big declicious beer."

"O: Definitely disappointing with a disjointed flavor profile which emphasizes bitter spices rather than the caramel and dark fruit flavors of the aroma."
"While this navigates a moderate course through the big malt swamps, it lacks much spunk or funk either. Quite sippable but less interesting that lots of other big beers."
"O - Overall, this is an above average example of the style, and worth seeking out. Green Flash does it again!"
"M + D: Medium bodied... a little bit of a bite in the finish. While it's not all that boozy in flavour, there seems to be a good bit of peppery alcohol on the way down.... almost enough that it makes me wonder if there are some chilis in here. That is a little unusual, but not terrible. A decent experience, and one I wouldn't mind repeating to really get a feel for the beer as I don't think one bottle quite does it justice."
"Thanks Jimmy Mike!"
"jd"
"O: A good Belgian Strong Dark Ale, but a bit too smoky for my liking."
"O: Pretty decent, a few quirks for me, not the best Grand Cru but not toshabby either"
"PP (Price Point) - $6.99 for a 22oz. bomber, Delivers on the ABV with its 9.1%, flavor profile wise its not doing too much for me other than the smoke. For a Grand Cru its not living up to me personally."
"22oz. bomber. Served slightly chilled."
"Good beer."
"Not mind blowing, but pretty good tasting beer that goes down easy."
"A very interesting beer from one of my favorite brewers. It hits some interesting notes with more of a sour/dark fruit flavor compared to the usual hop bombs."
"Beer is thin and really sweet with overwhelming yeast esters that dominate the mid and late palate. The esters are so overwhelming that I end up pouring it down the drain."
"Drain, beer. Beer, drain. No me gusta."
"The body was full, well-rounded and smooth. Drinkability was very good, for big beer this goes down way too easy. Overall, another very fine beer from a very fine brewery. Worth seeking out."
"overall - nice dark Belgian, maybe a little too sweet."
"O- not a bad beer, but would enjoy more in the winter. A nice attempt at the style, but doesn't unseat the greats."
"D – Nummy nummy! Would love to try on draft."
"O: A very nice brew. 4"
"D: This was weird. The scent and taste and looks just didn't match, but none were bad on their own. The alcohol was well hidden, so it wasn't difficult to drink. Worth trying once, anyway."
"It's very drinkable and I like it but it's just a little out of character."
"Green Flash has brewed some real gems over the years. This is not one of them. In fact, it's rather a disappointment, and not one I'll grab again."
"Verdict: Not good enough to justify the high price tag."
"D- not the most exciting example of one of my favorite styles, but nothing offensive either. the cost is also a little cheaper than most at $7.99. ill try this one again with some time on it."
"Being totally honest, I could not wrap my head around this brew, I have had their Tripel and American Tripel and enjoyed both (have not reviewed yet on BA) I struggled with the smokiness. To the point of wondering was I picking up rauch malt, or was something amiss with the beer. I default to the former, but being fair was disappointed and not into this particular offering. I like Rauch beers, but the smoke just did not work for me in this one."
"This beer pours a deep brown with some purplish edging against the light. Very minor head formation, even with slightly vigorous pour. Smells of belgian yeast funk, candy sugar, plums and currants. Taste is much the same, very good balance between the candy sugar sweetness and the dark fruits. I did pick up some vanilla notes as well as a smoky, almost woody aftertaste. Mouthfeel was decent, tacky from the sugars. A medium bodied beer that is easily drank and enjoyed. Solid beer."
"Sipped the 09 & then decided to give the 2010 a shot on tap while at rattle n hum's green flash takes over the taps night. Brew arrived in a tall glass. In the dar bar the beer appeared to be a deep purple filled to the top with no head. Smelled of dark fruit. Camze alive on flavor. Dark fuits but very sweet. Ezremrly drinkable and after tasting the 09, glad I got a full pour of the 2010."
"Altogether this is a good beer. Perhaps a bit different from its Belgian counterparts, it certainly has a lot to offer and is unique in its own way."
"D - It's a sipper, but good for the style"
"Heavy body, sticky, and lingering feel. Definitely a slower drinking beer, despite the quality flavors. The viscous consistency is pretty capable of slowing you down, but this is still more solid beer from Green Flash."
"Overall impression: nothing remarkable about this Belgian strong. interesting and worth a try."
"Overall, I didn't really care for this - it seemed like a pretty simple Belgian strong. I thought is was overly sweet and alcoholic."
"Picked this one up on a shopping trip, a few dollars more than the standard Green Flash bombers. That said: This one poured a medium to dark brown color, with a small, yet substantial, light tan head. Aromas of light caramel, spicy yeast, dark fruit and a bit of hoppiness. On the palate, this one was nicely balanced, spicy, a little hoppy, sweet with a subtle kick of alcohol on the finish. A nice beer."
"What I find here does make me interested in trying a vintage model at some point."
"Taste starts sweet, spices again in the middle, and then comes on with a gradually hops bitterness, but controlled. Mouthfeel is very smooth, and drinkability is way too easy for the style. Good stuff."
"Mouthfeel is medium-full with a smooth amount of carbonation."
"Chocolate and marshmallow sweetness is offset by a pretty hefty dose of hoppy bitterness. Alcohol also makes a strong appearance and dries things out on the finish. Maybe even borders on solvent-ishly harsh. Yeast is fruity...actually, I wouldnt mind a bit more of a fuller, bready flavor from it. Good flavor package going on here but turns a bit near the finish and leaves you wanting a silky smooth ending. Might be a fun experiment to throw one of these in the cellar to see if things smooth out after a year or so, but I wouldnt get my hopes up too high."
"pours a muddy dark brown color; small head with no real retention to speak of but plenty of lacing. sort of odd. nose is of dark fruits, yeast, and malts. pretty typical for the style. taste backs it up, though maybe more hoppy than what i noticed in the nose. alcohol is not as well hidden as i would prefer. still, quite tasty, and becomes more complex as it warms. mouthfeel is borderline decadent: rich, full, and creamy. well done there. i'm enjoying this, i would definitely have it again."
"Pretty nice drinker, but alcohol can be too warming"
"D: This is a beer that definitely needs to be sipped or the alcohol will quickly catch up with you."
"Drinkability: A slightly different kind of BSDA with a hoppy edge. I really like it quite a lot."
"Beer poured a dark brown with garnet undertones, little head on the pour. Nose is sweet suggesting dark ripened fruits are to come. Taste is interesting, sweet brown sugar, some roasted malts, and dark ripened fruits. I picked up chocolate with the first sips. Dry hops are in the finish. Mouthfeel is good, medium bodied, low carbonation, belgian yeast smoothness is there. Drinkability is good. The style is tough to peg. Basically it is a strong dark belgian but not in the traditional sense. An interesting beer to try."
"D- A decent beer. This merges Belgian darks with West coast hops."
"Was this a beer worthy of being crowned the brewery's 'grand cru', a term traditionally used to indicate the potential of the quality typical of the producer or their unique brand of terroir? Well, this is good beer, no doubt, and is fairly representative of the brewery's usual standard of quality. But if you want to truly taste San Diego terroir, stick to a hoppy IPA - dark strong ales like this are better left to the monks in Belgium."
" complex, intersting and unique, not exactly then poster brew for the style, but i'm enjoing it totally."
"Decent beer, worth a try if you like the style."
"Good beer. Bit sweet as a whole and strong. Poured with a small fine cream colored foamy head that quickly subsides and some lace. Color is a very dark cherry wood. Aroma is sweet malty a bit yeasty and roasty. Flavor's mainly sweet with the other aroma qualities larger also. Good full round body and good carbonation. Finish is mainly sweet with some bitterness at the very end. Not really a session."
"Not bad, but does not compare to other Belgian dark ales. There are much better examples of the style."
"Rosewood with dark red highlights and a creamy peanut butter colored head that leaves sheets of lace on the glass. The nose is rich and fruity with some alcohol and belgian spice notes. Big and boozy..but darn tasty too! Cocoa powder and mascerated dark fruit with banana, coriander and enough Belgian tasting yeast to stay within the style guidelines. The flavor complexities grow as it warms up a bit. Fairly light bodied with milder carbonation. Not truly Belgian tasting to me, but a still a fine beer that is worth the price of admission."
"Surprising bit of hop flavor and bitterness as well as thrashy tannins. Dark sweet malt, kind of thick. Some bitter compounds suggesting dark roast. Alcohol notable and pleasant. Tastes pretty good. Feels pretty good. Good drinkability."
"D - This is so delicious! It is on the sweeter side, though, so you wouldn't want to drink too much. I think a pint serving would be great. The bar has a policy of pouring beers over a certain ABV in half-pint servings."
"While little carbonation when poured, and fizzy at that, the beer is quite full of carbonation when it hits the tongue. Md-thick, but a late dextrinous thickness helps the body. Overall, a flat presentation of what can be an engaging style."
"Pours a dark amber to cola brown color with reddish highlights and a thin off-white head. Aroma is malty and sweet with notes of ripe fruit, caramel, honey, grains. Flavor is sweet and floral with notes of honey, spice, flowers, caramel, anise. Generally medium body with a sweet malty finish. Not a big fan of the style, but this one was drinkable."
"D - Great. Will seek out again, fantastic beer. Almost tastes like its made with a Belgian Abbey and California Ale yeast (cherry flavors)."
"Pours dark brown with a white head. The aroma is very sweet with dark fruit. The flavor is Belgian yeast and cand-sugar with some dark fruit mixed in. The alcohol is present and is warming. A pretty basic Belgian-inspired beer, but nothing special. Still, I don't think anyone will be disappointed if they try it."
"I understand this isn't a cherished Green Flash beer, but I think it's wonderful. Despite calling this ""Grand Cru"" (bad choice) and despite the use of Belgian yeast, it's unfair to judge this by Belgian dark ale standards. Just too much of a belligerent west coast vibe here; the label reads ""mysterious dark ale," and that's exactly right. Seems obvious Green Flash attempted a hybrid of two different worlds here. I'd put it closest to whatever a Belgian Black IPA might taste like, which probably gives style-purists a heart attack. Is there nothing Green Flash does that is less than mighty?"
"This would probably be better with strong-flavored foods like fatty, creamy dishes. The astringency prevents this from being considered a sipping beer."
"Drinkability is ok, I like the Belgian porter style, but could do without the spices, namely anise. It is also a touch heavy for a BSDA."
"Drinkability: nice overall flavors, but alcohol level knocks this down a notch. Slow sipping but more than one glass can be enjoyed here."
"Le Freak is a rock-solid example of an American-brewed Belgian IPA. Grand Cru isn't quite as solid, but it does have a certain amount of Big Beer charm. As long as you don't go in expecting the moon and the stars, this brutish brew delivers just enough enjoyment to justify the purchase price."
"Overall... this is just an ""Ehhhh"" beer for me."
"I really enjoyed the beer and think it represents the style very nicely. I would recommend trying this to anyone who likes BSDA."
"This is a pretty tasty beer...not the best, but very drinkable. The alcohol is very apparent in the smell, but not in the mouthfeel at all. It is sweet, with a slight bitter hint on across the tongue...the yeast used here lends itself to the banana and clove flavors, while there are some true Belgian-ish flavors coming through in the body...brown candy sugar, and that very earthy flavor."
"Overall this is one of my least favorite Green Flash beers I've had to date but it's still a solid effort. Try the DIPA and West Coast IPA first then give this a shot."
"Pours very dark brown to neear black with tan head that is very generous. Nose is dessert-like with sweet bread aromas, brown bread, brown sugar, and at least one more brown something or other. Palate is malty sweet with a brown sugary, perhaps cocoa-y flavor that has the yeasty bready flavors as well. More candy sugar flavors midway through the finish, and it finishes lightly sweet."
"Very good Belgian ale from a great West coast brewery. I aged this bottle for about 9 months in my makeshift cellar. I initially thought of Green Flash as another San Diego brewer of hop bombs. While I dearly love their various hoppy beers, Green Flash brews some big, complex styles that have much less to do with hops and they do it well (and, to be fair, all of the big SD area craft brewers do too once you get past the hop resin-covered surface). This beer pours a deep brown, only translucent at its edges, with very nice lacing. The aroma is rich and deep with good doughy malt character and lots of Belgian yeast. It reminds me a bit of Rochefort's quad without quite the heat or extreme complexity. The flavor doesn't quite live up to the nose. I'm not getting the sweetness that some people seem to report. It's very yeasty with dark stone fruits and a strong caramel malt flavor. The finish lingers pleasantly. The feel is rich and full. Drinkability is good, but how could that not be the case with a good Belgian-style ale."
"-couldn't really reach for this all that often based on my distaste for Belgians for the most part. not to mention the fact that it is pretty strong"
"drinkable to an extent. to be honest, I'd have a tough time putting down a whole bomber of this... but I'll admit again that I'm not the biggest belgian guy... literally or figuratively."
"Drinkability - It really isn't bad, but it ain't no grand cru."
"Full mouthfeel and very drinkable. I wasn't sure what to expect from this brewery(I assumed huge hop), but this is a very nice belgian style beer. I wish this was available locally."
"D - Pretty intense nose and flavor profile. This is no session beer, but if you're in the mood for a spicy, fruity interpretation of a Belgian dark ale, then give this a try."
"Very nice grand cru though on the sweet side. Pours dark and rich chocolate looking, with a thin bubbly head surrounding it. Malty aroma. A sipper with rich malt taste, above average mouthfeel. Satisfying and spicey,sugar, cardomon, not as yeasty as predicted."
"This one, a 22 ounce bomber, starts off well- a nice looking deep murky brew with a small head that is jsut right for the style. The aroma hits several of the BSDA notes- rich chocolate, hint of sweetness, hint of coffee. The flavor even starts out well- definite rich chocolate and chicory, pleasant mouthfeel, but then it goes south when I swallow. I would charitably call this an espresso bitterness, but no, it's way beyond that- it's harsh, medicinal, reminiscent of picking weeds as a kid and tasting them, only to find out that they taste horrible. Burnt grains, don't make me take that antibiotic pill again, please! I'm sorry, such promise, but there are so many great examples of this style- I just cannot drink this one."
"Green Flash did a nice job with Grand Cru and came close to brewing an amazing beer. The flavor is very deep, complex, and impressive. At the end of the day, alcohol just seems to be too prominent and warm. I'm guessing that this would be better at 7% or 7.5%. Nonetheless, it is very good. It's not very competitive with some of the best BSDAs out there, but it's easily competitive with the second tier. Well worth picking up if you run across it."
"Poured into a chalice a nice dark brown color, nice carbonation, nice little fizzy off-white head, with some sticky lacing. The nose is malty, with some yeast, figs, raisins, plums. The taste is sweet, malty, yeasty, nice dark fruit notes. Medium body. Drinkable, this is a pretty tasty brew."
"D: Okay, tasty but not my favorite style."
"Pours deep black with fluffy slightly off white head. Surprising aroma, more like a Belgian golden, spicy, fruity, phenolic and sprightly. Taste is surprising, roasty and sharp, with nutmeg and cinnamon, slight hoppiness, fruity esters. Mouthfeel is thin and carbonated. Very puzzling and surprising. Surprisingly dry finish"
"D - Aftertaste not neutral enough for me as a session. Besides, 9%..."
"I was very surpised at how good this was. Definately a candidate for long-term cellaring. Nicely done."
"Dark, dary brown ale pours a tan one finger head into my Rochefort chalice. Nose is yeasty with fruity esthers, pear and apple, and some malt. Taste is sweet molasses and belgian yeast up-front with a warming alcohol finish accompanied with a mild bite from the hops. Beer has medium to heavy body. Nothing too impressive here compared to other BSDAs, but still a good beer that I'd prefer over many other ales outside this style."
"Body is decently sized, carbonation is pretty high to offset the otherwise large barley load. A little different for this style, but I like it quite a bit."
"Drinkability- One of the most drinkable of the American made Belgians I have sampled. Very nice flavor and I would love to revisit it."
"D- It's more drinkable than the AleSmith Grand Cru. Definitely not one you'd want to have more than 1 bomber of in a night, but pretty drinkable while you're on that one."
"Pours a black to dark purple with good clarity and a well-retained brownish head. Sticky cobwebby lacing. Nose is roasted dates, prunes, with some dark chocolate and dark malts. Yeasty and earthy notes in there too. Fruity, dark roasted flavor. Biscuity quality, with chocolate, graham crackers, prunes, raisins, ethanol. Alcohol approaches an over-aggressive state, but barely manages to maintain a balance with the rest of the beer. Finish is sweet dates rolled in burnt breadcrumbs. Full bodied, approaching syrupy. Drinks well...its a brute if the whole bottle is taken on alone, i imagine. My wife was happy enough to help drink this one."
"7/5/7/4/15/3.8"
"Potent, almost port-like. Rich, bitter-sweet and spicy."
"Interesting beer, not one I'll seek out again but one worth trying."
"Good brew."
"This brew appears light black--kind of black like a malty stout, but light in that you can see light make it thru if you tilt it just right. Both head and lacing were present throughout the drinking session. The smell is Belgian. Though the label says ""mysterious," the smell is distinctive Belgian. I smell no malt, no chocolate, no vanilla, no oak, and--not saying there should be any of those flavors--all I smell is Belgian. I don't drink many (b/c I don't really like 'em all that much), and it took me a while to recognize the aroma. Eventually (and perhaps clued in by mention of Belgian yeasts on the bottle), I remembered this Belgian smell. The taste--what do you know--Belgian. That's all I can say--it tastes similar to every genuine Belgian I ever remember having. I'm sure it's a result of inexperience with the style, but that's all I can report in regards to taste. I really can't even call it malty or sweet; I just call it Belgian. The mouthfeel is good--I taste the alcohol and the carbonation allows the beer to sort of thinly coat my mouth. As I allow the beverage to just rest in my mouth, I can feel the taste disintegrate into layers...layers of Belgian taste. If you like Belgians, this has got to provide for you a drinkable brew. Since I don't really like but respect them, I'd call this a slightly better than average (Belgian) beer."
"The drink is medium-bodied with perfect carbonation and is entirely quaffable if you're down with getting floor-knocked by the bomb-your-ass 9.1% ABV. An excellent and surprising offering from a brewer that has yet to fail me. Green Flash rocks, and Grand Cru in particular is a whipass brew."
"Pours dark brown with a pretty nice head that leaves some lacing. Smells sweet with bubblegum as well as quite a prominent aroma of tangy Belgian yeast. Tastes quite complex with a lingering bitterness, more sweet bubblegum, and the usual panopoly of spicebox flavors derived from the Belgian yeast. Nicely balanced, and nicely done. A bit tannic in the mouth, but the lingering bitterness plays off well against any residual sweetness. Nice effort."
"Purchased: Plaza Liquors, Tucson AZ"
"smooth, medium body, slight resins and acidity or astringency in the finish. lively carbonation."
"Clear chestnut colour with a reddish hue and a thin beige cap. Spotty lacing with good head retention. Nice aroma, banana, yeast, bready, nutty, and spicy. Quite sweet and malty, nuts and toffee, dark chocolate, fruity banana, and a bit of alcohol. Medium bodied with low carbonation, very smooth. Pretty good, tasty and easy drinking."
"This deal takes a while to warm up to, but in the end, it's solid."
"Mouthfeel is medium full and rich with a good amount of carbonation."
"Sinkability - It's not often I dump a 9% ale down the sink, but now that I think about it maybe that is why I did it. You can't down too many more beers after a strong bomber like this and I just didn't want to waste my alcohol intake on something so lacking in quality and appeal. Probably one of the worst Grand Crus that I've ever had."
"Received in a tulip glass for a thick, blackish body with one-finger head that receeded slowly. A good sweet malt and hop mix in the smell, but nothing stands out. Smooth and creamy, with a fuller-body that mixes the sweet and roasted malt tastes (I'd say caramel and maybe toffee for the sweet, no coffee malts though) and dry, citric hops. Finishes with a prickly, dry hoppy backbite after a sweet and not heavy (ABV hidden well here) beer passes the tongue. A very enjoyable beer."
"A nice, spicy, bready, dark sipper. An interesting brew - ""Belgianesque", but ""American"" in character, as well."
"Drinkability- a nice winter sipper, didn't than traditional Grand Cru'. recommended to try something a little different"
"Overall a very nice brew."
"Pours a deep brown, almost black, with a slight red hue. Slightly tannish one-inch of foam. Beauiful. Palate is filled with cherries, dark berries and red liquorice. More than a hint, but not overdone either. Interesting and tasty. A slight amount of carbonation makes the flavor pop. Could use a little more hop presence. Has a pleasant feel on the mouth, very light relative to its very dark color. Alcohol is extremely well hidden. Very round beer."
"Drinkability- Quite different in flavor than tradtion suggests. It has the spot on base of candied sugar and yeast, but gives it an added kick with the hops and deep malt. Interesting experience and quite tasty. Recommended to at least give it a try."
"Pours a deep brown color with ruby highlights, nice dense khaki colored head that settles into a solid cap. The aroma is sweet and spicy. Strong presence of candi sugar and banana/clove, candied cherries and floral hops complete the aroma. The taste is of candied cherries, raisins, honey, clove, hints of carob and a subtle bitter hop in the end. The feel thick and well carbonation. The carbonation keeps the brew from being slick. The BSDA is a bit harsh, the ABV is noticable. Could use a few months of cellaring to mellow out the booze. A very good American version of the BSDA; Green Flash can make a good Belgian style brew with an American twist (hops)."
"Mouthfeel is full bodied, lightly carbonated, with a creamy booziness in the finish."
"Overall, great example of the style and very much above my expectations. Green Flash is definitely an underrated brewery IMO. Recommended."
"An OK beer but I didn't find this to be memorable."
"This beer poured a very dark red, almost solid black color and formed a nice foamy light tan head that left latticed lace as it subsided. An aroma of malt, coffee, chocolate and dark fruit like plums, etc. The flavor was of malt, coffee, chocolate, Belgian yeasts, and some hops. The body is medium light and the finish slightly sweet yet astringent."
"The body is closer to full than moderate. A lot going on here. Carbonation is a bit low. This could see some improvement with age, but overall a pretty tasty beer."
"Drinkability is good and hindered only by the alcohol, which isn't even that noticable while drinking it. Well hidden, it creeps up on you later."
"Pours dark brown with a squatty off-white head. No lacing to speak of. Deep, dark fruit aroma; prunes, plums, raisins, and concord grapes. Caramel candy, yeast, and musty malt as well. Sticky, yet carbonated mouthfeel. Compliments the sweetness of the beer, but gets to be a bit much towards the latter half of the bottle. Lots of sticky malt and dark fruits throughout the taste. Slight phenols pop up as it warms. Molasses, plums, and confectioner's sugar accompany the malt towards the back. A true Belgian, but leans into the dubbel category."
"Not nearly as sweet as many syrupy iterations of the style, quite drinkable."
"A delight several times on tap as part of the Belgium to Brooklyn fest at Muggs in Brooklyn, NY, last week and reviewed from notes. Poured dark mahogany, murky under a medium tan head, gobs of fine lace on the glass. Dark fruits in the nose. Full flavor, complex offering, dark dense malts, more dark ripe fruit, figs,rum drenched raisins. Buttery mouth feel, initially a bit sweet, but hops drop in late for a dry long finish. Simply yummy, big, bold strong and @ 9% quite heady stuff. Fine sipper/night cap. I don't recall seeing bottles of this one available in the my usual NY/Ct/Ma beer spots...what a shame"
"D: Another real good beer from Green Flash, it seems they can do no wrong."
"Pours a mahogany color with a tan head. The nose has dark fruits, candy malts and spicy Belgian yeasts. Taste is also on the sweet malty side with subtle floral hops and peppery yeast. Medium to full body is a bit over carbonated. A good beer, but not the same quality as le freak."
"Drinks pretty, good, this a good stab at the style that I bet will age nicely. I'm sure that booze warmth will mellow over time, well done Green Flash!"
"Chocalately flavors with a violet middle. The belgian spices add a soft creamy character with a long finish. Very easy drinking with the alcohol well hidden. Bold fruits lead by plum with a pruny ending. Some fig and quince paste as well. Nice and very palatable beer."
"D - ok but the sweetness with the bitter finish hurts the drinkablity for me"
"22oz bottle $6.49. I am always game to try a new Green Flash beer, some are great, some are good, I have only had one that I considered bad. This was dark, dark, brown, almost black with a head that is huge and fluffy. It smells like spice, clove, banana, standard belgian yeasty smells. Flavor was also clove, spice, and licorice as well as something that reminds me of westmalle dubbel. Easy to drink despite the alcohol which is not offensive but make no mistake it is not hidden."
"Medium bodied, moderate level of carbonation, dry on the finish."
"Sidenote: Green Flash is really stepping it up with their beers as of late. Here's to hoping Chuck keeps pumping out some incredible seasonals to complement the already solid year round releases."
