I disagree with most posters who state this is an overly sweet beer and do believe the use of raisin is both subtle and interesting at the same time.  I would not call it a brown ale and would classify it In a general fruit/veg category.","TomIvan","Feb 07, 2015"

I didn't have a chance to try Midas Touch or anything too wild, but I quite enjoyed this one along with a precisely medium lamb burger. All in all a good experience from start to finish. A spicy Belgian malt and yeast taste serves to excellently compliment a color and faint sweetness which are not entirely unlike Russian kvass (a beer-like soft drink made from fermenting roasted bread rusks together with a variety of fruits and herbs). Definitely something I would order again or buy in stores.","MaddestHatter","Apr 28, 2014"

I would not accompany this with a grilled steak as is suggested by the brewer, but rather a rich flavored, savory stew with a large chunk of crusty homemade dark bread and butter. You need rich fats to accompany this properly. So, also enjoy this with rich, flavorful artisanal cheeses and crusty breads.

The nose has notes of raisin and malt but doesn't have much to it besides that. It is decent and delivers what the beer is meant to smell like, but no further phenols. Tastes of malt and raisin but the alcohol destroys the balance, overwhelming the beer. The mouthfeel is good, medium bodied with nice carbonation.

Beet sugars keep that vegetal note intact, but the boast of fig and raisin flavors have evolved into a complex fruit element that includes plum, date, and dried apricot.

There are a few elements that detract from the overall impression, such as the watery texture and the hint of cough syrup in the flavor. Still, a very well done version of the style that doesn't need to try too hard to impress. Would recommend this to someone just starting to get into big beers.","BethanyB","Nov 16, 2013"

I assumed it was categorized as a fruit/vegetable beer. When I tried it, I thought it's flavor profile reminded me a lot of a dubbel, only lacking some of the rich maltiness. When I saw this was a Belgian Strong Dark Ale, I definitely agreed. It's a very nice beer and I'm glad we have a brewer like DFH who is willing to constantly try new things.","deadonhisfeet","Oct 14, 2013"

I was very off-put on my first bottle, but after subsequent drinks I've come to like this a little more. I would drink it if offered, but probably won't be buying again. That said, I appreciate what the guys at Dogfish Head were trying to do; I just feel like they could have executed a little bit better.","Caj1","Jul 01, 2013"

Most of the head disappears pretty quickly, but a little lingers on and leaves a little lacing on the glass. Aroma is mostly sweet malt notes (caramel, fruit) and a little bit of spice. The taste is very similar, with just s hint of hop bitterness on the finish. A little heavy on the carbonation and little thin on the mouthfeel but neither is really a detriment.","delta490","Apr 03, 2013"

In terms of taste, the beer is very sweet, almost overpoweringly so. The raisin and sugar are apparent, masking the alcohol until the aftertaste. Overall, the sweet mixture gives this beer a unique and strong character that can at times be overwhelming. Consuming a single bottle of this beer, in my opinion, is enjoyable for its unique and sweet flare; anything more would be a bit too much sweetness.","stride28","Feb 04, 2013"

Fun to try, but best in small quantities. Too sweet. I don't consider this in the Belgian style at all.

3.71,1.4,3,4.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Raison D'Etre pours a fairly translucent ruby red, with a good amount of lighter red highlights. Maybe a finger and half of cream colored foam rises up atop the beer. Head retention is alright, and lacing is fairly disappointing/nonexistent. The nose is simply wonderful. Raisin centric dark fruits lead the charge, braced by a firm supporting aroma of brown sugar. A light clove note completes the picture. The flavor profile doesn't quite follow that layout, to somewhat ill effect. Everything starts out fine, with the raisins, plums, and figs taking the spotlight, but leaving some room for the brown sugar. The finish though is pretty harsh. I don't know if the phenols are just too intense, or there's some unnecessary hop bitterness exacerbating them, but the beer just doesn't close nearly as smoothly as it should. The mouthfeel is decent, with a nice, vibrant carbonation. The body is just a little bit full, but it's a close thing. Raison D'Etre is another solid offering from Dogfish Head.","axeman9182","Nov 14, 2012"

The taste is dominated by the strange taste of beets. Off the bat I'm not really a fan. The deep malt taste isn't offensive but it can't do much to save this beer from my judgement. It has a nice carbonation and a light body. Overall I can't say I'm really enjoying this beer at all. That's Dogfish Head for you, it can be really hit or miss!","dontpanic5","Oct 04, 2012"

Smell is of toasted malt, brown sugar, and some slight dried fruit aromas. Taste is of roasted and toasted malt, burnt sugar, spice, and some fruity flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of roasty and spice bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel.

I'm typically a whisky connoisseur when I have a real meaty meal but the other night I decided I was going to branch out. I was at as small plate restaurant called "girl and the goat" which I highly recommend in Chicago. Any ways I told the waitress I wanted a full body beer that had somewhat of a bitter/sweet finish, she recommended the Raison D'Etre. Needless to say this beer did not disappoint. The brew was full of flavor and match quite well with my steak and fish. This has become my new favorite beer when I only want one or two drinks with a nice steak. I hope this review was helpful.","thebeerarchitect","Jul 05, 2012"

It does finish a tad hot, that is the biggest fault I can find with this beer. It has a good amount of carbonation, not enough to over power the flavor of the beer, which is substantial. Overall, this is a pretty good beer. I have had it before, years ago on draft, picked based upon the interesting name. I feel good about my decision then, and even better about it now. Quite a different beer than what I have recently been drinking.","omokoro","Jun 30, 2012"

Smells of amber malts, sweet dried fruit, and a hint of vanilla. Taste is of very malty dried raison. Some boozey vanilla notes. Seemingly hidden flavors at fist taste, but they really develop on the tongue in the aftertaste. Its fantastically smooth and really full of hidden flavors that linger. Overall, this is a great brew. Not sure if id classify as a belgian though. Its taste a little closer to a a Strong Ale, but either way, its a great brew and worthy of a try.

3.47,-5.2,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Poured a mahogany color (this is good), but minimal head, some bubbles but no retention. Sweet aroma of molasses and sugar, are dominant. Some fruit (green raisin?) and herbal hops. Nice mixture of smells. Complex pile of flavors. Some of the same sweetnes from the sugars, molasses and caramel flavors. Some spiciness, almost yeasty notes as well. Herbal, earthy hop finish. Lots of alcohol coming through as well. Medium body and carbonation, not really as smooth and creamy as I was expecting, a bit of a hot finish from the alcohol. Overall this is a complex, and flavor filled beer, but just didn't do anything for me. I guess I had a different idea for a Belgian Dark Ale. It is good, but just not for me. I still have a couple bottles - maybe the flavors will grow on me.","BigBry","Mar 06, 2012"
3.92,7.1,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"Pours as described: mahogany, with a finger of honey cream foam that falls to a scattered surface leaving cobweb lace. Smells of raisins, honey, candy, and the slightest hint of brown sugar. Flavor is sweet and malty. Plenty of the candy sugar comes through, and the malts seem appropriately oxidized adding just a hint of woody character. There is a nice, subtle belgian character in the yeast, but not nearly as dominant as the homeland offerings. Nice, moderate body is matched with a good, smooth and prickly carbonation. I dig this offering, not so much fresh, but at this point, I really enjoyed.","harrymel","Mar 05, 2012"

Aromas of big molasses, raisin, candi sugar, plum, caramel, herbal spiciness, chocolate, toasted malt, biscuit, yeast spices, and a touch of alcohol. Nice and well balanced aromas with some good complexity. Taste of big molasses, caramel, herbal spice, chocolate, raisin, candi sugar, biscuit, toasted malt, and yeast spices. Lingering notes of caramel, biscuit, dark fruit, molasses, toasted malt, and spiciness on the finish for a bit. Nice balance of flavors with good malt balance without being cloying. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a fairly creamy and slick mouthfeel. Alcohol is well hidden with only a warming on the finish present. Smooth drinking for the alcohol level, but is still a sipper. Overall this is a very nice Belgian dark ale; with nice complexity and good flavor balance.

2.07,-43.4,2.5,3,1.5,2,2,"The palate, on the other hand, is a bit of a mess. Spicy alcohol and phenols combine to make a rather paint-thinner like beer with a mild raisin sweetness in the mid-palate before a moderately strong bitterness takes over in the finish, completely ruining everything. The sugar beets add plenty of sweetness. Now, the paint thinner dissipates as the beer breathes, making it moderately more palatable and brings to mind cheap rum, but the bitterness on the finish really clashes with the raisins and the fruity yeast. Full in body, mildly soapy and slick, this beer is lightly carbonated and rather disappointing. I can't imagine drinking more than 4oz at a time, let alone a 4 pack.","DefenCorps","Dec 01, 2011"

It is just a little TOO sweet to be a session beer, but it desperately wants to be a session beer. I've written too much about this beer. It's worth a try if you've never had it.

The smell of the beer is a little boozy but has a nice sweetness to it that gives off a Raisin and brown sugar aroma. The taste of the beer is pretty sweet and has lots of dark fruit and sugars in there. It's more like a dessert beer I feel personally. The mouthfeel is slick and almost oily but has a good carbonation to it still. Overall I like it, I choose it over most of the other DfH beers are festival for some reason... Not really sure why.

3.28,-10.4,4,3.5,3.5,2,3,"Pours a rich mahogany color with dense, creamy medium-tan colored head. The aroma definitely features raisins, and there is also some brown sugar, caramel, and even some white wine as the beer warms. The flavor has a muddled blend of molasses, raisins, plums, a spicy combination of hops and alcohol, and even a little chocolate. The fine, selzer-like carbonation, assertive booziness, and the drying finish all distract from the flavor profile, however. Overall, this one is not quite so "off-centered," as it actually seems mostly on-style, but the off-putting mouthfeel and alcohol presence really drags it down.","devilben02","Aug 10, 2011"

3.6,-1.6,4,4,3.5,3,3.5,"Poured on-tap into a tulip, the beer is an auburn-brown color with a thin layer of off-white head. There are aromas of grape sweetness, with a sweet malt highlight. Very rich on the nose. The beer's flavor is strong, with a merlot character, and a tangy, sour fruit undertone. The aftertaste is minimal, with a bit of the fruit sweetness again. The finish is dry, and it keeps the flavors from being overpowering or cloying. Deep, dark, and heavy flavors make this one a sipper. Unique and interesting beer.","GarthDanielson","Aug 07, 2011"

2.7,-26.2,3,3,2.5,3,2.5,"Overall I thought this was a pretty average beer that I really wasn't that into. In theory it sounded like a good choice since I like that raisin taste I get from malt heavy brews but this one was just far too sweet and unbalanced for me to like. I really don't like overly sweet beers so that was what I liked the least about this beer, but the flavors in the background that I picked up when it warmed up were nice and would have suited this beer better if they took the reigns and let the sugar and alcohol take the backseat. I don't think I will buy this again, if I am craving a Belgian Strong Dark Ale I will stick with my go to brew for that style, Trois Pistoles. I can't say I recommend this brew since it doesn't do a good job at representing it's style. This beer just didn't do it for me and is now my least favorite Dogfish Head Brew, sweet and boozy just don't work for me.","StoutHunter","Jun 29, 2011"

Cherries again on the tongue, smokey toasted malts, red wine character, and alcohol all over the place on this thing. Medium bodied, dry dry finish, so very sweet, tingly tongue from the carb. This isnt very good. For starters, the alcohol burns and dominates like crazy for an 8 percent beer it shouldnt do that.

There was no lacing evident throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, dark fruit, and sugar. The flavor was of sweet malt, dark fruit, brown sugar, and slight alcohol. It had a medium feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. The flavor was very well balanced with no sign of alcohol anywhere to be found. Not sure if it was the ~1 year of age in my cellar or what, but I found this one to be very subtle on alcohol and all of the other flavors were very nice and robust.

The taste is of sweet malt and beet sugar. Personally I do not like it, think it's kinda gross, but I get what they were going for. It's just an over malted ale to me. I'm not getting any raisin at all. Like a lot of DFH's beers, this drinks exceptionally smooth. I just can't like this. It's flavors are odd and the 8% is pretty noticeable.

The aroma initially has the tartness of the golden raisins, but is quickly overpowered and masked by the caramel malts. In addition there is the pleasant aroma of honey which is muddled by the smell of liquor on the back of the nostrils. The taste is of caramel malts and the booze. There is a significant bitterness that goes with both. There is the distinct flavor of golden honey which is this beers saving grace. The aftertaste is the only place that you'll find the raisin flavor. The bitter astringent nature is more akin to an Old Ale than the BSDA. It's drinkable in the sense that you can consume it no problem if you sip it. Dear lord don't drink it too fast. Too much on the mouth makes this beer taste worse.

Its so well masked for 8 percent and it doesn't even have that many hops to cover up that alcohol! Which is very impressive. It smells like a dark fruit and can definitely pick up the raison smell. Behind those smells is a very deep rich roasted malt. The taste has that deep rich sweet malt backing and the raisons and hops come together to have that earthy very slight bitter finish. Very well crafted. I hardly taste any alcohol in this as well. That doesn't mean though that you can't feel it. At 8 percent its a high alcohol beer so you can only have a few which is its only downfall. At least you'll be keeping the 6 pack longer than you usually would though!

Full mouthfeel with low carbonation, a bit heavy feeling at times, though I keep trying to remind myself that this is 8%. Not much desire to keep drinking it as my glass sits around the halfway point. Not a bad beer, but there are many others in their portfolio that I would rather have.

Afterward, two flavors hit a wall: a bitter green leafiness (or unripe coffee bean), and a sharp, metallic sweetness. The finish is alcoholic, sticky, and lingers, but ultimately feels way too flat.

First impression on sipping it is the massive mouthfeel - hugely thick, sugary slickness. The sweetness lingers throughout and is backed up by a strong second-string malty presence. Flavors take a back seat and are hard to discern on this palate of mouthfeel, but I'd summarize it as raisins, grapefruit, hint of pineapple, oats, maltishness?","BeerNinja007","Mar 08, 2010"

The figgy waves, though, are the ones that hit the hardest once the tasting begins, the malts and raisins rowing ashore bedecked in full ninja regalia. This covert crew and their more ostentatious front-line compatriots sit somewhat heavily on the tongue, almost languishing there, but are saved by the grace of a very smooth texture, keeping them from malingering in Limbo with Virgil and his cohorts, but not raising them too far up the purgatorial mountain.","TMoney2591","Feb 02, 2010"

The smell is a little unique, very sweet smelling, much like sweet roasted malts. A slight smell of hop, but clearly a malt dominated beer. The taste is very similar to the smell. Sweet roasted malts, toffee, caramel, brown sugar and a bit of a buttery taste. Much like the smell, there isn't much of a hop taste to it, dominated by the malts agian. The mouthfeel is good. Pretty smooth, nothing bitter about it due to the lack of hoppy flavor. I think this is a pretty drinkable beer, I was finished with it before I really knew it.

As you drink, several layers of lacing form, which equals cool. The smell on this one is currently faint, I blame it on the cold, but the smell (as I remember and can pick up) is peculiar. There's some definite sweet characteristics to it, brown sugar, a little bit of fruits - presumably the raisons - and possibly the last hard to identify smell is the freaking beets! I have to remember this was made with beet sugars, I love Dogfish Head. The taste is fully backed up by the smell! I hate it when I become fully enamored with the smell of a beer and the taste doesn't follow suit, fortunately that's not a problem with this beer. In the taste you get the malts, the raisons, the sweetness and some sort of other added spices. All of it works beautifully together and it's a freaking joy to drink.

Which made it very easy to taste all the wonderful flavors of this beer. Had barley any head at all, but that's what I like. Goes well with spicy foods. Just be VERY careful.

Aromas are very thick of molasses and some alcohol sweetness with no discernible hop characteristics. The feel is pretty slick and very coating with barely enough carbonation to balance the heavy syrupy body. Flavor is very chewy with lots of molasses, brown sugar, and the SLIGHTEST bit of raisin (though if you weren't looking for it, it could be pretty hard to find). The finish has a very modest bitterness that is not really from hop character, but mostly from a roasted barley character. Above all, however, the lasting finish is really a continuation of the wave of thick chewy flavors from earlier. I guess I don't particularly perceive this as very complex, just big really and I have a very difficult time categorizing this as a Belgian strong dark ale. It's really more like, Dogfish Head strong dark ale. Overall, it's not as balanced as I would I like and it seems a bit heavy handed.

It smells of subtle roasted caramel malt, bittersweet chocolate, a little vinous essence, and a bit of bitter coffee. The taste is lightly roasted caramel malt, a tad chocolate candy-like, a bit of booze, dark fruit, and earthy hops. The carbonation is moderate, the body thick and viscous, with the booze well-integrated, and an off-dry sweet candy malt finish. This seems much more like a brown ale, a style I don't usually care for, but is also more of a ramped-up American version, and is thus quite tasty.","biboergosum","Jul 06, 2009"

3.49,-4.6,2.5,3.5,4,3,3,"Pours mahogany with a head that lasts the first few sips. Rich raisin and buttered toffee aroma with some faint bubblegum. The flavor is almost exactly like my first attempt at homebrewing a brown ale: slight suggestions of over-ripe bananas that turn to bolder flavors of sweeter brown sugars, followed by alcoholic phenols and a roasted cocoa finish. Mouthfeel is nothing special, but I wouldn't want it any more or less carbonated. Nitro might be interesting though and might fix the quickly dissipating head and add to the general richness surrounding the beer (maybe too much). Overall impression is that there's a lot going on, but I found it pretty damn enjoyable. I do agree though that it seems way more like a light-bodied wee heavy (with all the complex flavors) rather than a belgian strong dark ale.

Poured a deep dark brown color with a really weak head and no lacing to speak of. Aromas are those same meaty, chocolatey maltiness with some strange over-ripe fruit. Body was alright, but still.

4.01,9.6,4.5,3.5,4,4,4.5,"Ok... first off, I have no idea why this beer has such a low rating, I think its awesome.. However I do notice it is listed as a Belgian strong dark.. Never would I have assumed this was a belgian dark (I dont even like Belgian darks! Ever!!) I know Dogfish says they used Belgian-style yeast, but, again, I would say this is more of a sweet hybrid-brown ale or something... Anyway.. The appearance is a beautiful ruby, almost burgundy when light passes through it reminiscent of the beet sugar in the ingredients (not that I know if a beet's sugar is the same color as a beet).. The aroma is bit of a weak point, its definitely nice with malt and a bit raisiny with a presence from the grapes used, but its sort of subdued and would be nicer if a bit more prominent. The taste has a lot of malt but, like aroma, in a more subdued way.. It doesn't have a huge presence like a doppelbock or Dogfish's Palo Santo or such, but thats sort of nice for this beer, giving it a bit more drinkability in a social setting. There is brown sugar in the taste and a bit of dryness in the clean aftertaste. Mouthfeel is really nicely balanced, a lighter moderate with carbonation thats not biting. I think its pretty great, maybe the characteristics could be a bit bolder, but their subtlety may be the beer's strength..","BirdFlu","Mar 16, 2009"

By the end, it has turned into a slightly sour raisiny flavor, and not sour in a real good way. Like an ascetic burnt bitterness. There doesn't seem to be much of a step B between steps A and C. Mouth is hugely cloying and coating, but there really isn't much carbonation to move things along, which in this case would help bigtime.

If we're rating as a strict Belgian Strong Dark, it fails miserably, but I really just think DFH wanted to make a strong brown brewed with raisins and beet sugar. In that respect, it's a very good beer. If we're judging it against Chimay Blue or Gulden Draak, it's a failure. I prefer to think of it in terms of the former - a nice strong, malty American Brown brewed with raisins. In that context, it's a success.","Patrick999","Dec 02, 2008"

Medium light bodied, full flavored the malt character finishes beneath the smoky spicy sweet aftertaste. The earthy yeast and biscuit malt are overshadowed.

There is a thick head that eventually settles down and a few lingering spots of lacing that lazily attempt to cling to the glass. The aroma is a subtle mixture of dark fruits and sweet malts accompanied by a sugary afterthought. As I sip from my glass the flavor comes alive. Sugary and sweet there is a dominant malt presence that tangles all of the fruity and spicy flavors together followed by a nice warming alcohol effect.

The smell is sweet, with notes of prunes and not surprisingly raisons, as well as a dark malt. Seems slightly cloying in the nose, and this translates to the flavor, cutting back on drinkablity. Though otherwise the flavor is nice, with sweet dark fruits up front going into a rich and coffee/espresso malty finish that finishes nicely. As said before it is a bit too sweet, but an interesting beer for sure. My only real complaint is that there is very little Belgian about this beer to me. I don't know what style to call this beer, but where Belgian strong dark ales have a refined complexity this beer has a loose impressionistic flavor that seems to fall in with american craft brews.

What you will get are lots of heavy fruits - figs, rind, raisin -- blended quite nicely. This is a nice, enjoyable, full bodied beer with complexity. I don't know if it's a very good Belgian, per se, but how often are labels misnomers anyway. As the Bros mentioned, the ABV is a bit too pronounced.

As it warms in the glass it takes on more of a spiced wine taste but still holds a distinct character. It finishes with a creamy and caramel like flavor. I wouldn't suggest it as something when the months get warmer and the days get longer but in the cold times were in right now, this is an enjoyable beer to curl up on the couch with the wife, a big quilt and a movie.","Dalem","Dec 27, 2007"

I taste a little bit of vanilla and malt in the sweetness but it is most powerful in it's fruit wine-like qualities and it's a little too strong in that way for my tastes.

All in all a good beer but must be drunk cool, the ABV keeps it from being a quaffer. The syrupy quality keeps it from being a sit back and relax beer. A nice change and that's it.

This is a sweet smelling beer. The first aroma that hit me was raisins, there's also some brown sugar, molasses and caramel. The taste is very malty and sweet, like raisins, figs, brown sugar, caramel, butterscotch and an herbal taste that reminds me of Jägermeister. Finishes with a bittersweet aftertaste. Mouthfeel is medium, with it being a bit syrupy with just the right amount of carbonation. Drinkability is good, the alcohol isn't too noticable but it does hit you after a while. Aging this beer for a year hasn't hurt it at all, it's pretty tasty! Another good brew from DFH.","bluejacket74","Jun 23, 2007"

Definite candylike flavours, butterscotch-caramel, along with the juicy plum and the raisins I caught in the aroma. Nutty flavours, and a sharp, almost metallic note in the finish. Nothing comes to the forefront, it just seems a bit messy to me. Way too damn cloyingly sweet as well. Mild carbonation in the mouth, extremely heavy body, thick and leaning toward syrupy. Wet and creamy texture. I like dessert, but with less sugar. This is like a store-bought cake with that icing that gives you instant hyper-sugar-rush.

This beer hits hard with sweet malt flavors and follows up with raisin aftertastes. For 8% alcohol, it hides the taste well and is incredibly smooth.

The flavor is exceptionally fruity, but it takes a while for this to be completely apparent. At first is seems like a brown sugar/molasses, with dark fruits type beer, and it is. But as it warms, and as you have more than one or two, more and more flavors become noticeable, red and white grapes, plums, dates, figs. This beer remains sweet with the Belgian beet suger always there, but the darker fruit flavors, and some hops keep it pretty balanced as well.

Appearence is the same as the fresh, but that's it. The smell is much stronger - you pick up the raisons in a bit of a spatlese bouquet. The taste also exhibits more of the raison/spatlese taste, but unfortunately the bitterness has been enhanced to almost an unshakeable sourness that is not at all pleasant. Mouthfeel and drinkability are also different. No trace of carbonation at all - very smooth and more like a port wine or a brandy. This is the second Dogfish I have aged over 2 years, the other being an Immort Ale. Both have taken on this smoother, more brandy like taste and texture. If the sourness were absent, I would say that I prefer this one aged just for the other qualities it seems to bring out.","Onibubba","Nov 02, 2006"

4.05,10.7,4,4,4,4.5,4,"I really enjoy this beer. I keep going back for more. It's almost an after dinner beer, and it's rather on the heavy side  it's just massive on several dimensions. It's a deep woody brown clear beer with a foamy head that has not much retention due to its high alcohol content. There is quite a lot in the smell and it's sweet and molassesy and thick smelling. There are spicy, cherry, nutty and caramelly notes in the nose. It tastes all at once toffee and bready and raisinesque with spicy hop notes throughout. This is a BIG beer. The finish is note as long and bitter as one might expect from such a huge beer and I suspect it's partially due to its serious sugar levels; it's just a very sugary finish leaving a candied sticky taste (but not a bad one) on the palate. I find this beer does well at 45 degrees as suggested but is also really great at 60 degrees. The mouthfeel is full and expansive and sticky.

Decent lacing has been present till now, about two-thirds of the way through. The nose has a lot of figs and pecan pie, but you have to really dig your nose in the glass to find out. Taste starts of with the figs, along with some raisins, leather, and cigars; then moves to a very delicate oaky scotch with a pruney finish. Light carbonation helps this brew out signifigantly. I will be picking this one up again, mostly because I like the flavor combinations, rather than a particular complexity.","thinkfull","Aug 15, 2006"

Creamy off-white head barely reaches one finger and shows lacking retention leaving scarce spotty lacing. Phenolic notes of raisins and a rose alcohol aroma. Taste is very sweet upfront; roasted barley and toasted crystal with a tart, phenolic plum flavor. Dry aftertaste with a mild alcohol bite, some english hop bitterness and raisin sweetness. Just slightly crisp low-medium carbonation accentuates the alcohol snap in a silky medium-full body . The finish is residual and slightly boozey, but fades quickly enough for a decent drinkability. The alcohol does however meld with the hops to balance the sugary/tart flavors wonderfully.","PBRstreetgang","Aug 08, 2006"

It certainly didn't have the signature Belgian fruity esters. To me it tasted like a blend of a Scotch ale and a Belgian dark, but that is in no way a criticism. Dogfish Head has made a business of breaking the mold when it comes to beer and this is simply an excellent beer that stands without the pretense of stylistic categorization.","SacoDeToro","Jul 26, 2006"

Cocoa seems to round out this one with dark malts and a faint hint of cherry tartness mixed with a dulling raisin character.

Aroma is mostly sweet booziness -- dates and dried figs soaked in rum, but mostly just a vapor of alcohol. Prickly sweet alcohol flavors at first; cherries, prunes, and date sugar sweetness. A vanilla-marshmallow taste is also detectable. The finish is a pleasant toasty malt flavor -- unexpected and appreciated. Mouthfeel is definitely the strong point here: full, expansive, briefly fluffy, then chewy, and overall, at once both effervescent and smooth. Such a complex mouthfeel is always a high point for me.

Definitely worth the $1.99 at Liquor Max, and thanks to Nick ("Crosling"), the beer side manager there, for the recommendation.","ColoradoBobs","Mar 13, 2006"

Someone else actually pointed that out to me; the candi sugar is really, really strong. The taste follows up, with lots of sweetness and some fruits in the background, though they're once again overpowered by the sugar. The mouthfeel is syrupy; it sticks in your mouth and lingers for a while. Had to rinse with some water before trying other beers. This ain't a beer you want to drink a lot of.

The biggest surprise, however, was that this tasted pretty much like any other ale that I've had. What makes it impressive is that it's 8% abv.

The taste is mild for this style with the interplay between fruity bitterness and specialized candy sweetness not as well as could be. The raisins definitely dominate the brew as it warms to such an extent, it detracts from the overall taste and texture. Though the alcohol was well concealed, when mixed with the raisins, it created a sour taste in my throat, hence the reduction in drinkability. Worthy of trying for it's unique take on this style.","jaluria","Jan 03, 2006"

The alcohol is forefront, with a sweet tartness behind it. The "green raisins" used in the brewing impart a fruity taste. Mouthfeel is good, non-slick, smooth.

Whether you're brewing beer, playing music, or writing stories, when you take changes and do things differently, you will sometimes produce a bad result. This is what happened to Dogfish Head with Raison D'etre. The tastes are oddly cobbled together--raisins and hops and who knows what else, mingling awkwardly like incompatible members of a reality show. For all the oddness of the beer, it's actually bland in many ways, particularly during the first few sips. The more I drank, the more the odd and unpleasant tart and sweet fruit tastes came forward. I would have preferred the relative blandness of the first few sips.","GnomeKing","Aug 01, 2005"

I also like to swirl the glass and savor each sip, that wasn't the thing here either. This is a disappointment but then I thought, Dogfish must be going for this. If this is the case, and you love the raisin taste of shiraz,(try "Jake's Fault Shiraz" out of California) you will love this and think it is the best beer ever.

I read about this beer, and brew my own; so I boiled raisins one time and know exactly what they taste and smell like. I can definitely taste them in here. The mouthfeel is definitely one that I can't say I enjoy too much. Its too sharp on the palette, and not easy to take. This is definitely out of the box thinking for brewing. Sam is definitely creative. But for myself I think this might be an aquired taste. This was also sitting on the back of a warm shelf for a while in the store. It was dust covered and bent up.

Tan / burgundy head falls to a trace, laces well, nice oily cling to the glass. Smells of cocoa, deep dark friuts, all hidden behind a malt base. Lightly hopped and tart. Tastes fruity sweet with pruned, dates, raisons, figs. All the goodness that you'd like from these fruits with only a mild tartness. A red wine-like muskiness in the body. Silky smooth rich body that nicely fades into the finish. Very consistant flow down the throat. Mild cherries show up in the finish. Mildly drying and mildly sweet. Dangerously easy to drink.

Where is the 8% abv? The folks at Dogfish Head are masters at hiding the alcohol in their high octane beers. Wait, there it is, a subtle burn on the swallow followed by a nice warming feeling going down the chest & into the stomach. Again, very well hidden, almost TOO well hidden. No more than 2 of these if you're planning on getting behind the wheel (and even that's pushing it). Nice, almost chewy mouthfeel, you know you're drinking a brew of substance here.

The taste is an intricate amalgam of different malt flavors. There are dark fruit, chocolate and bran flavors that get breadier as they mingle with the hops. Hop flavor is perceptable though very subdued. Hop bitterness is evident in the finish. The alcohol is definitely noticable, though its pretty modest for its ABV.

I'm thinking belgian style deserves a belgian glass. Was I wrong? Beer pours a red wine and brown colour. Pretty much no head. Violently poured, it comes with maybe a double fingernail thick that quickly disipates to nothing. Not a very good appearance. Smells of brown sugar, wine, alcohol, caramel and butterscotch. Not too bad, but a bit off with the sugar. Taste is too sweet. It's like red wine. Actually, it reminded me of Jewish wine. Very, very sweet. Raisins, sugar, malt, caramel, sugar and raisins. Mouthfeel is harsh from the alcohol, and actually quite thin for something so syrupy tasting. Drinkability is low. It's just not a good beer.","slitherySOB","Dec 04, 2004"
4,9.3,4,4,4,4,4,"Bottle: Poured copper color ale with a very small head that disappeared a tad too fast. Aroma is quite sweet with alcohol soaked raisins being quite noticeable. Body is quite full and carbonation is very low. Taste is very interesting resembling more like a barley wine (sweet raisins, warming alcohol) then anything else. The Belgian yeast must have been covered because I had a hard time detecting it. Overall, this is quite different but very enjoyable.

The beer is lightly sweet, yet rich and creamy, with perhaps a hint of butterscotch. There is a lot of great fruit flavors here, there is some definite raisin notes here as well as Muscat, and flower nectar. There are also some subtle spice notes here that seem to be yeast/ fermentation derived. This beer is quite interesting, and in some ways quite light, yet it is still quite rich tasting. This is quite tasty, and is certainly proof that Dogfish Head certainly likes to push the boundaries a bit.","Gueuzedude","Nov 30, 2004"

The flavor is nice, slightly malty sweet, but also a lot of alcohol noticable and touches of honey, dried fruit, and a slight bitterness at the end.

I did not notice the alcohol as much as some others did, and the balance is actually more on the subtle side (my wife had an Ommegang while I was drinking this, and the Ommegang's flavor was much more pronounced - and sweeter). Pours a dark ruby shade, with little head, no lacing. Raisons certainly come to mind. For those who enjoy a dark Belgian-styled ale, (and also fans of Baltic porters?)it's worth trying.

A fair bit of yeastiness in the aroma, too. Rather sweet right of the bat, then mild fruitiness kicks in and the finish is light, hoppy and estery. Pretty interesting and unique.

First sip, light-moderate carbonation. Wow this beer is interesting. Very malty, pretty strong sweetness. It is also hopped just right. Light bitterness is present in the entire sip. Finishes dry and lightly bitter, and you can definitely feel the alcohol evaporate off the inside of your mouth when you exhale. It definitely warms me up.

Under that, lots of alcohol with little to no carbonation. Hops are not used to the best of their ability. Nice malt flavor on the finish, but a bit too dry. Not enough carbonation in the mouth for me. And, alas, not an incredibly quaffable beer. All in all I'd say a bit too complex without having any focus. Tastes all over the place.

The metallic quality ebbed as the brew warmed and I noted what seemed like cherries?....it took on an almost wine like quality and ended with a lightly carbonated finish that was somewhat refreshing.

The aroma has a hint of sweet malt and a fruitiness that is either contributed by esters or from the green raisins. The flavor is definetly Belgian as it reminds me of a good tripel yet the color throws me off as i keep tasting for sweet malt and carmel flavors. The carbonation of this ale lends more credibility to the Belgian qualities as it just has that Belgian feel that is hard to describe unless you have tasted hundreds of Belgian beers and talked about many of them. Flavor has a slight carbonic bite followed with sweet malt and with a clean finish but with a lingering flavor of malt. I can't taste the green raisins but i do think that the beet sugar gave it that belgian candy sugar quality.

Aroma was complex and interesting. There were notes of rum, raisins, licorice, and candied apples on the nose. The taste was similar to the aroma: fruity, peppery, vinous, and dry. The alcohol content is high, but very well hidden. I think they went overboard with the adjuncts and neglected the malt in this beer. The result is a thin, watery, and disappointing mouthfeel.

I guess before I even start to explain my review, I must say that I reviewed it as a strong belgian dark ale, and this does not have the ideal characteristics of one that I have ever come across. It lacks the initial sweetness that I look for in a good belgian. One thing this beer does have on its side is a complexity of flavors hitting the mouth. From start to finish, you pick up many "different" flavors. The finish isn't bad, but not what a good strong belgian normally has.

It'll get you when your not looking. It poured out a nice dark brown in color. The nose was pretty sweet but it also smelled like it could have a bite. (and did) The head came and went rather quickly. You could definetly taste the green raisons which was much nicer than I thought. The flavor lingered long after swallowing.

At first the melding of the raisons and the belgian beer sugars is interesting, but eventually it kinda overpowers your taste buds. The alcohol is very evident... not bad on a cold winters day, however. This stuff I've found is better on tap. Out of the bottles its just too syrupy.","ChrisBowers","Jan 10, 2004"

Lots of bubbles racing to the top on this beer. The smell is really strong with alcohol and has a slight brown sugary sweetness. The taste is malt heavy on top. It's sweet but not residually sweet. Maybe thats the belgian beet sugars coming into play. There's a base of caramel malt in here also but it only hints at coming out never really becoming a strong flavor. Alcohol is present the whole time and becomes exceedingly strong towards the end. Belgian yeast provides a slight offset to the alcohol but not enough and is different in its own right. The body is rather thin, maybe because of strong alcohol precense or lack of carbonation, and it's not the smoothest beer. But the complexity and originality of this beer make it something unusual and well worth trying. What style is this anyways?","granger10","Jan 07, 2004"

Very silky to the tongue with light carbonation -- there really was almost no head on this beer except with a brutally aggressive pour. Alcohol gets obvious pretty fast. Aftertaste has an odd, almost-roasted bitterness that sweeps up everything but a barely lingering SunMaid raisin kick.

4,9.3,4,4,4,4,4,"Pours a fairly clear chestnut color with a creamy light tan head that quickly fades into a thin and patchy lace. Nose is candied sugar, sweet grain, light chocolaty malts, rum-soaked raisins, and a bit of spicy alcohol. Moderate in body and slightly syrupy in texture. Taste begins quite sweet with flavors of brown sugar and lots of roasted malt. However, even with the strong malt presence, its not quite enough to counterbalance the intense winey alcohol that follows with notes of raisins and tawny port with a bite of peppery spice in the finish. Of course, a beer need not necessarily be balanced to be enjoyable. An intense and very complex beer. Thanks to faernt for the sample!","Morris729","Jul 17, 2003"

Aroma is a malty light caramel and dark fruit ensemble of softness - raisin, plum, and apricot with a fairly solid amount of alcohol in the nose as well. Taste is smoothly subtle and calm with an easy caramel malt start that flows into the dark fruits of mostly plum and raisin, slight molasses and banana, notes of cinnamon and sugared beets. Finish is a nice candy sweetness of caramel and yes, more raisins, quite nice in its subtlities throughout each sip. Smooth, light creamy body feel with a small warming alcohol kick in the finish. I really liked the subltities in the flavors of this beer but lacks in richness and some bolder character in the feel and smell.

The high ABV of course gives the flavor a little bite, and there is also some candi sugar thrown in here for more sweetness. Alot of malt makes this a treat, along with a good medium body and a somewhat chewy texture. Drinkability is good, but it would be better if this weren't so drinkable with 8% abv one is enough.

It's not bad, just odd. There seems to be a bit of spice in there as well, but it's hard to pinpoint. Soke residual sweetness on the finish, with just a touch of bitterness. The mouthfeel is very full and smooth. The alcohol warms a bit as it goes down, like a good smooth bourbon. The drinakbility is average due to the odd yet complex flavor profile.

3.58,-2.2,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"I couldn't get excited about this beer. Everything is there but not put together in a sophisticated fashion. Deep copper color, and a non-existent head. Nose is sweet and phenolic with some fruitiness. The taste is one dimensional, a bit grapey but nothing jumps out to grab your attention. A wouldn't call this a Belgian style, the complex yeast notes and intense flavors just aren't there. It didn't improve with warming either.","QXSTER1","Nov 13, 2002"
4.34,18.6,3.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,"Yeah!!! Very nice stuff. The only downer was it maintained zero head, beautiful mahogany colour. Lots of raisins, caramel, touch of port and some smoke. Palate is complex round, raisiny, port-like, toasty, oaky, spicy, with some peppery alcohol in the finish, very resiny, oily, creamy and round, lots of flavours to describe in this one, excellent stuff","rastaman","Nov 04, 2002"
4.19,14.5,3.5,4.5,4,4,4.5,"This beer poured a dark reddish color and formed a small bubbly white head that didn't hold and left little lace.  Some carbonation present.  An aroma of caramel and other candy frangrances.  Flavor of caramel and raisins with a slight hint of the alcohol present.  A good beer, but not a traditional style belgian.  Typical Dogfish experimenting.","Wildman","Oct 30, 2002"

4.2,14.8,4,4,4.5,4,4,"The last line on the label says "brewed with a sense of purpose." Well the purpose is to make me happy! Pours a dark mahogany color with a limited head that leaves patchy lace. First aroma is of fruits, not sweet, not sour. A taste of Belgian candy, alcohol, and a crisp finish. For an 8% ale, very drinkable. Excellent ale.","HopheadEd","Oct 27, 2002"
2.67,-27,4,2,3,2.5,2.5,"I picked up a six-pack of this beer with high hopes, based on a friend's recommendation and the great reviews that it had received.  Nice mahogany color.  Thin head dissipated quickly.  At room temperature aroma has hints of carmel and raisin.  Initial bland fruit taste surronds then is swept away by overpowering alcohol flavor.  Combination of carbonation and  alcohol tingles the tongue.  Complex finish gives the ale its "sense of purpose" as the label states.  Flavor definitely seems to improve as the beer warms to room temperature.  This is the first Dogfish Head brew that I've tried and it has taken 2 separate attempts at drinking it to warm up to it.","Winter","Oct 18, 2002"
4.32,18,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Deep burgundy color, thin beige head. Lots of rich warm smells of rum cake. Candied fruit apples and raisons are very noticable. Taste is smooth, sweet, and very inviting. Bready flavor matched with nice warming alcohol. Taste is much of liquid rum soaked raison bread. Very smooth, and rich going down, but also matched with a slippery candy, syrupy feeling. HIgh abv does catch up with you. One of these a night. This was a much anticipated beer, had multiple samples at the 2002 GABF.","StevieW","Oct 17, 2002"
3.06,-16.4,4,3,3.5,3,2,"As the bottle states, this is a deep mahogany beer, to which I cannot disagree.  Rather attractive in the glass, the nose is bread-like with hints of caramel and a bit of mustiness, which seems both promising and forboding.  As could be expected from a beer of 8% abv, alcohol plays strongly in the flavor.  Unfortunately, the alcohol was a bit too strong on the opening of the flavor, rather than rounding it out with some warmth.  Once past the alcohol, candy sugars dominate with the green raisins surfacing nicely to give some identifiable flavor to the otherwise anonymous swetnesss.  Not quite as much body as anticipated but decent warmth due to the alcohol.  Undoubtedly some credit is due for a bit of uniqueness, but I felt the alcohol could stand to be tamed a bit.  Didn't find myself longing for another.","jmatthew","Oct 16, 2002"
3.7,1.1,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"I've never had "rum soaked raisins" but have probably used the description in past reviews.  After this beer I can more confidently say that I've actually had them.  Other than that, it seemed a little flat and alcohol-laden to me, but it was fun to drink one of them.","pbrian","Oct 07, 2002"
3.44,-6,2.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Not too bad, you just have to remember that it is 8.0% abv and not to suck it down like any other beer that is on-tap.","Jason","Aug 24, 2002"
3.45,-5.7,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"Garnet hue w/ good clarity, topped by a quickly dissapating head.  No lace is left.  Leafy tobacco & raisiny, dark caramel Special B (and / or real raisins?) sweetness in aroma.  Light acetaldehyde as well.  Deeply caramelized sweetness hits the palette initially, but vinous flavors & mild bubblegum esters quickly follow.  A bit cidery from the dark candi sugar in the grist. Hop bitterness is mild, but manages to offset the relatively high residual sweetness.  Lightly bodied, w/ a mouthfeel that borderlines on being thin.  Finishes clean, dry w/ a fading molasses flavor.  Although a tasty brew, I was expecting greater complexity and richness.  Raison D'etre is without flaws, however.","marc77","Aug 01, 2002"
4.6,25.7,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,4,"An incredible beer. Pours out to a darker than expected amber with a slight head. Smell is that of fruit. The taste is fantastic. Fruit and licorice seem prevelant and the alcohol is hidden quite well. As it warms up, it gets better.","proc","Jul 18, 2002"
4.05,10.7,4,4,4,4.5,4,"An unusual and interesting beer, but then aren't all of the Dogfish Head beers? It took a long time for this beer to grow on me. It pours a deep crimson-mahogany with a creamy light tan head that drops quickly to just a collar (probably from the high alcohol). I like the aroma of dark caramels (toffee) and fruit. The flavor offers up a lot of alcohol, some dark fruity (raisins) maltiness, and some balancing bitterness. The flavor is actually quite toasty with a fig-like fruitiness. The finish is dryish and not nearly as complex as the flavor but does have a lingering sweet raisin-like note that's quite nice. The high level of alcohol is quite hidden. Overall, this is an expansive beer that doesn't reveal itself at first and deserves some extra attention and a few re-visits. It's a beer that I drink when I know I'm not having another but I still want something unusual and rich. Very well done and certainly worth a try. I've also noticed that this ages exceptionally well with bottles that are at least 6 months old becoming much smoother, and bottles that are a year or more old revealing a deeper character.","NeroFiddled","Jul 15, 2002"
2.93,-19.9,4,3.5,2.5,3.5,2.5,"I find it to be overly sweet with brown sugar and raisin flavors that don't blend well with the alcohol flavors. I will say that this is a well crafted and complex beer, but all the different flavors just don't seem to come together. That makes me 0 for 2 with Dogfish Head. BTW, it totally ruined the flavor of the nice Cuban I was smoking.","Longstaff","Jul 12, 2002"
4.58,25.1,5,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,"I was really blown away by this. I guess it is considered a Belgian Ale, although it does not taste much like Chimay or the others. I actually like this a bit better than the usual Belgians. It is very full, somewhat heavy, and awesome all around! The smell is that of raisins and a touch of alcohol (but not overpowering). The taste is bold and fruitlike (raisins, currants). The alcohol comes through in the taste but in all the right places. Exceptional beer!!!","Jdiddy","Jun 15, 2002"
4,9.3,4,4,4,4,4,"I drank this in contrast to the Chimay Red I tried tonight. Less of the Y-grass/raw carrot taste than the chimay, but more of the raisony flavor a lot of belgians have. Perhaps because I also drank the World Wide Stout on the same tasting, I also noticed a lot more caramelly/toffeeish flavors than in a typical belgian. I like the dark malt flavors in this beer. Makes for a nice twist on a Belgian. Palate still heavily carbonated, but less fuzzy than chimay. This beer is also more ruby and less brown than the Chimay.","aracauna","Jun 14, 2002"
4.08,11.5,4,3.5,4.5,4,4,"Clear, deep-brown color, controlled 1/2 inch head.  Aroma is a little fruity, touch of sharpness approaching skunk.  Dense initial mouthfeel, lower carbonation.  Sweet and just a touch of raisin and other dried fruit flavors.  Actually, more of a plum taste in some ways.  Hops are reserved to my tongue.  Nice mixture of robustness and lack of greasy slickness.  Sturdy without being heavy or overly fruity.  Alcohol content was pretty unnoticed by me until close to the end.  Cool brew, quality.  Thanks to Bighuge for dropping off a sixer.","ADR","May 31, 2002"
4.32,18,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"This brew pours pretty dark.  Dark Ruby.  Has a thin laced tan head that laces nicely.  Interesting aroma.  Like brown sugar and rock candy. Some malt tones too.   Nice.   This beer has some definite sweet tones mixed in with alcohol.  It's a nice taste.  Rock candy comes to mind again. An undenying sweet flavor.   Some lingering alcohol and bitterness on the tongue.  Body is medium to full.  Nice brew here.","Bighuge","May 08, 2002"
3.8,3.8,4,4,4,4,3,"Something completely different. Poured from the bottle to not much head. Chemical fruit aroma, like cherry cough syrup. You can smell the alcohol. Initially like wine, then chocolatey sweet, fruity but an alarming finish - incredibly bitter. Cleans out the back of the throat as it goes down. I'm getting very medicinal qualities from this. The alcohol is blatant. I like this beer, I admire this beer... True, I wouldn't want to drink more than one at a time, but hey, this is art, right?","Thrasher","May 06, 2002"
4.45,21.6,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Very different on tap than in the bottle.  Here is a bottle review:  Pours with a quickly dissipating head.  Dark ruby color.  Aroma is big alcohol, sweet sugar, and some nutty like cashew with spicy, yeasty hints.  Complex flavor, sometimes mellow, with deep peppery hints and some yeast bite.  Finish is smoky like true scotch ales.","Andy","May 05, 2002"

4.13,12.8,4.5,4,4,4,4.5,"Pours a beautiful deep red/orange with a thick creamy head that lasts well.  Smell is of sweet malt (caramel?), tartness of the raisins and slight alcohol.  The first taste is of a slight roasted malt bitterness that is quickly erased by the sweetness of the brew.  Not a sticky sugary sweet but a natural one that goes nicely (from the beet sugar?.)  There is also some tartness from the raisins.  The beer is creamy and smooth across the palate.  The surprising lack of alcohol in the taste makes this beer extremely drinkable.  I really liked this beer.  Very different, this is one of my favorite things about this brewery, there products are always different.  Even when they fit into a style they put a nice twist on the style.","Murph","Apr 19, 2002"

4.5,23,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"12 oz bottle.  Deep red sweet belgian ale. Smell of sweet, malt, and belgian yeast.  Complex flavor, tart raisins, malt, and lots of alcohol.  Not a drink for the timid.  I like this beer very much as a nightcap.  It is a change of pace.  It is perfect to unwind with but, @ 8%ABV be careful.  Well crafted with unique flavor, it is rare to taste these divergent flavors of beet sugars, candy sugar, hops, and malt in an American Brew (or any brew). "A" for effort to the Delaware guys.","frank4sail","Mar 28, 2002"

It's definitely complex, and I admire Dogfish Head for the effort. Just a bit too much going on, in my opinion, to add to my list of favorites. Of course, that will not stop me from drinking it when I'm visiting my folks down in Lewes!","mophie","Mar 28, 2002"

It has so much complexity that it could be integrated into a fancy meal, yet it's cheap price and sweet taste make it an ideal beer to drink for a night of interesting conversation.  A superb brew.  NOTE:  I just had another of these beers in March, and it was not near as good as the batch last November - too flat and sweet.  There seems to be some inconsistency in their brews at Dogfishead.","mmthompson33","Nov 09, 2001"
