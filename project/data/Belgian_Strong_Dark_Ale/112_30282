3.55,-6.3,4.25,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"750mL bottle served in a Belgian tulip glass.  Beer pours chestnut brown in color with an ample head.  Classic, yeasty aroma.  Flavor is traditional BSDA: rich, yeasty, Belgian.  It's rich but not complex.  Dark, but there's no depth of grain flavor.  Dry in the finish, hoppy even.  Very drinkable, and perhaps a great introduction to the style for novice advocates of high-octane beer.  A solidly mediocre offering of a style with great potential.","hreb","Friday at 09:27 PM"

Other reviewers mentioned it is a bit thin or as having a one note of sweetness, and I get that too especially cold.

APPEARANCE: effervescent off-white bubbles light up an otherwise dark-as-ebony-keys  body; two-finger brown head is sudsy and substantial... AROMA: heavy plum and apple early; approximates a red wine with some astringent, brackish notes... PALATE: wow--full-bodied, raking the tongue with a dry finish that demands another sip; warming and hearty; thick and creamy....TASTE: plum indeed, and secondary fruits include apple, pear and lack currants--big and flavorful; stoutish at its finish... OVERALL: a BIG beer that warmly mellows--not as complex as Monk's music, but no argument that it pleases as ""Straight No Chaser"" might on an autumn night...","dacrza1","Nov 22, 2014"

The beer smell is a bit sweet and dark fruity. The notes include plum and raisin. The taste is very similar to the nose with the same dark fruit taste. However, the taste also has a slightly sour note as well. The malt notes also come out in a caramel form that gives it a bit of sweetness with a roasted finish at the end. The mouthfeel is a bit heavy bodied and fairly smooth but feels slightly watery. Overall, an okay bee but not one I'll pick again.","HattedClassic","Sep 27, 2014"

The yeast doesn't quite compare to a good Belgian version of this style, and the finish is a little too dry. On the plus side, I'm a jazz fan and at least the money I spent on this beer is going to a good cause.","Phocion","Jul 19, 2014"

Flavor is toasted malt, fruit--figs, a bit of toffee and yeast, delicious and unique! Overall this is a very good to outstanding medium brown ale.

It’s sweeter than most beer I like, but it is so pleasantly so… some of these strong abbey’s can have almost a syrupy sweetness that is too much. But this is the most well balanced and blended beer of this style I’ve ever had. It is sweet… it’s supposed to be, but something in the smokey malt flavors really balance it. I don’t directly taste it and find ‘hops’ but there is some element of a dry bitterness there subtly in the background. It washes so cleanly, that it makes a great sipping beer. One of the few beers I consider too good to chug.","burntoutphilosopher","May 17, 2014"

Imagine my excitement when, soon after returning to the Ohio Valley, I spy a 4 pack sitting oh so obligingly in a local beer spot. I took her home, chilled it a bit but not too much and the rest, as they say is history. Sweet and Delicious, plus you can't beat that label. Who doesn't want to promote Jazz music?

Not sure if it was a different batch, the brewery or just being on vacation, but I enjoyed this a lot more when I was out there.

Easy enough to drink but not worth any extra effort, the complexity just isnt there and the balance lacks as well.","mick303","Nov 27, 2013"

The aroma is a dense, spicy dark fruit that give you a hint of what your tastebuds are in for. The taste is a very deep and intense spiceness that exudes the Belgian yeast flavors with a sweet caramel and molasses. Brother Thelonious is very complex from the banana and bubble gum flavors of the Belgian yeast to the spicier and sweet dark fruit. I really enjoyed this beer and for an American version of a Belgian Abbey Style Ale it is fantastic. It is thick and complex and gives you a lot to chew on.","brurevu","Nov 14, 2013"

The head is voluminous and creamy, but quickly subsides into a narrow, persistent band. The scent and flavor are matched. There is a touch of an alcohol bite, but not much considering the ABV. Then, a flood of raisin and prune, sweet and malty. I am very much reminded of the Corsendonk Christmas Ale.

I detect the fruity bubblegum type aromas from the yeast, some sweetness, and some malt. The alcohol does have a strong presence in the aroma. The taste up front has all the characteristics you'd expect from a good Belgian dark ale. There's some darker malt flavors with caramel and dark fruits. Then I get that alcohol kick right afterwards that overrides quite a bit of those flavors. That's a bit disappointing because I wanted to really taste the other stuff that was happening here. The body is medium to full with moderate carbonation. The finish is slightly dry. This is a good beer, but could have been better if the alcohol flavors were masked better.","acevenom","Sep 07, 2012"

Aroma of dark fruit and light caramel malt. Light to medium body. Lightly sour and malty up front with light and dark fruits, boozy. Malty middle. Tart and sweet malt finish. Medium bodied.

Some nice soapy lacing clings to the glass, with a fair amount of carbonation streaming up. Aromas of big raisin, plum, banana, molasses, pepper, clove, caramel, toasted biscuit, dark candi sugar, yeast spices, and a bit of alcohol. Some pretty nice aromas, with good complexity and balance. Taste of big caramel, raisin, toffee, prune, molasses, banana, chocolate, dark candi sugar, light pepper, toasted biscuit, and yeast spices. Lingering notes of caramel, molasses, raisin, prune, banana, candi sugar, biscuit, chocolate, and light pepper on the finish for a good bit. Very nice flavor balance with no cloying sweetness at all. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with fairly creamy and slightly slick mouthfeel. Very smooth to sip on; with only an alcohol warming present after the finish.

There is a slight bitterness which tends more towards the charred malt side than the hoppy side, there is no obvious hoppiness, perhaps some to cut the sweetness of the malt. This is actually a very drinkable beer, and goes down very easily, but in my opinion the balance is just a little off.","ribby","Feb 27, 2012"

It leaves the mouth a little numb and gritty. It kind of tastes like fruit cake, but not so sweet. Plum and molasses are detected. There a light bitterness at the finish.

From what I can recall about the first three, the aging did it some good in terms of blending the flavors. It is definitely on the sugary molasses side, but it remains rather drinkable right up to the end. The alcohol scent doesn’t translate into the taste, which I find to be a good thing. The alcohol and sugar does start to dominate the nose after the first half of the beer is down. I think this beer is much better with some age on it.

The pour is a decent looking reddish-brown but the head dissolves quickly. The aroma tends to remind me more of wine than beer but it has an inviting character with its toast and apricot fruit. The body is around medium. The 9.4% ABV is noticed in the flavor right off and it certainly smacks me across the face with its potentcy. It tends to take over the taste.

There's also a trace of oxidation that comes out towards the back. Mouthfeel is medium-light in body with a lively carbonation. A pretty tasty brew that has definitely held up well over time.

The overall taste/flavor is of carmel, fig, sugar, alcohol, malt and mellow ""un""hoppy hops (if that's possible). Brother T is a smoother, deeper, sweeter and more 3-dimensional inviting drink than Chimay Blue, which I felt was good, but more one-dimensional and less ""crafted"" tasting.

However, he was the best analyst at Association for the Study of Peak Oil and Gas.

But it was once I took a sip that everything really came together for me. A wave of cascading brown sugar and tart apples just rolled across the tongue. Enormously rich and vigorous, this was just a wonderful thing to behold. Nice touches of chocolate and rich toffee like notes were all balanced well in advance of a lovely dark fruit tone that led the charge once the yeast kicked in. Nice notes of prunes and rasins, hints of plums and dark cherries were all very much evident in the profile. The carbonation was spot on, as the rich, velvet like bubbles converged on the tongue and added to the prickly pepper like spices that lasted long into the finish.

Sour notes at the back of the tongue, with caramel, raisin, and apple flavors. The beer feels awkward in mouth, and the flavors don't seem to blend well.

Otherwise there's a bit of spice, but this beer needs a bit more complexity to stand up to the leaders in the style.

It maintained nice lacing throughout. The aroma was comprised of malt, fruit, and a subtle hint of alcohol. The flavor followed the nose with malt, fruit (mostly bananas), and a slight alcohol burn upon swallowing. It was light on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was not that bad.

The flavor also starts out with huge fruit notes (blackberry, cherry, raisin, date), along with some burnt bread, candy sugar, molasses, esters, yeastiness, flinty hops and alcohol.

The taste runs along somewhat similar, though darker, lines: notes of figs, raisins, cinnamon, sharp bitterness, cracked pepper, and light vinegar pervade the tongue. Something seems off...I can't put my finger on it, but the combination just leaves a bad taste in my mouth (literally). Well, not bad, but definitely not good either. The body is a surprising light medium, with light carbonation and a very fluid feel. Overall, I've gotta say that I'm pretty disappointed in this brew.

Rich chocolate with just the right balance of bitter and sweet are the first big tastes. Mild phenols and a very slight flavor of ethanol spill into the finish, which fades all to quick leaving no real residual cloyingness. The mouthfeel is light and bubbly. Obviously some adjuncts are used to cut down on the body and/or bump up the abv. Great example of proper use of adjunct. Excellent drinkablity. A dangerous 9.5% abv beer.

It does leave behind a film that is slow to recede. It has a slightly spiced plum aroma with a hint of sweetness. It reminds me of a dubbel. It isn't overly complex, but good. The flavor is very malty. I can taste caramel, plum, and toffee. There is a tart fruitiness in the finish and a mild chalkiness in the aftertaste. I'm unable to taste any of the alcohol. It has a medium body and a lot of carbonation. It leaves behind a full coating of my mouth. This feels like a big beer. There is some stickiness in my mouth but not on my lips. This beer is very drinkable. I'd like to keep a few bottles of this on hand.

Really, the malt profile is the only thing holding this back from true greatness. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with tons of effervescent carbonation but just a small sting.

This American Dubbel from North Coast smells of sweet dark fruit, alcohol and a bit of sweet malt. The fruits are the expected raisin and fig, with some brown sugar and vinous notes. The taste is an amplification of the smell, with certain elements becoming more prevalent, The raisin comes forth as well as molasses, with some sweet malt coming through towards the end and a hot alcoholic finish.

Dark brown, almost no head or carbonation but you wouldn't especially expect a beer like this to have either of those. Nearly 9% ABV and this was a big bottle, it packed a wallop. It wasn't the easiest beer to drink. The sweetness of the malt and the sweetness of the high alcohol were not as balanced as I would have liked. There is definetly a market for this beer though, it just may not be me. I have seen this beer (and maybe you have too) and have been curious for a while.

It taste like there is a bitter and a sweet taste are competing for dominance in the beer and it is ruled a tie. For someone that does not usually drink black beer, its pretty good.

It's a lot heartier than most of the other dubbel's I've tried, it is almost what you see from Strong Dark Ales in terms of substance. Bold belgian flavours, buoyed by just the right levels of carbonation and stickiness. Drinks absolutely exceptionally and easily, to the point of being dangerously so.

I found Brother Thelonious tasty, but not overly complex, though I may have drank my pint a bit cold (frosted glasses--seriously???). Most clearly present was the same sweet fruit, particularly cherry and raisin, as in the smell, with some maltiness. The stickiness and dry finish of the beer also brought to mind licorice flavors.

Nice and complex. Taste is also sweet upfront - a candy sweetness -hints of licorice, rum soaked raisins, and the bubblegum that came through on the nose also makes it's way to the tongue.

Once in the glass it was a little less yeasty, but still very vinous. Plenty of toffee too, plus some plum and raisin notes. Pretty much the same in the flavour. There was a bitter edge that became more pronounced in the finish along with some alcohol flavour and warmth. Quite fruity overall. Light spice in the finish. Medium bodied with moderate carbonation, decent texture, slightly dry in the finish. Not a bad drinker for the abv, but a fairly mediocre dubbel.","DrJay","Nov 04, 2008"

This promptly degrades, however, into complete blandness with merely overly strong, persistent tartness being the main quality, with only very weak hints of cranberry and burnt dried fruit. It rapidly becomes tiresome and boring, the tartness which at first seemed like a nice quality utterly dminates the drink, leaving almost no other taste or character.

Dark, black and ruby color with a decent sized head that leaves copious lacing around my Duvel glass. The taste was pretty good, considering I consider Dubbels and darker styles of beers to be less appealing to my palate in comparision to tripels and pale ales. Overall, an above average dubbel.

The color of the head is great but it is not full and sticky like those of the the Belgian beers. The aroma is wonderful: candy, brown sugar, malt, cherries, lots of biscuit, and maybe a little banana. The taste is also splendid but the flavors are more central: brown sugar, dark sugary dough - lots of dark sugary bread-type qualities, actually - malt, dark fruit, bananas, a little oak, candy, spices, and alcohol, which tends to add a little spice itself. Also, I feel like there is a little bit of a tobacco character, but in a good way...kinda weird...but good. It has a full body, but I wish it were a little heavier in the mouth.

It has a dark (stewed/fruity?) character in the aroma. Taste further supports the aroma, but it does add a bit more complexity. There's a hint of bock/melanoidan character (different, but OK here) with a healthy dose of aged character too (which I don't necessarily like here.) I wonder how old this brew is, but I have no idea from the bottle. Come on breweries...give the end-user some sort of date! Whatever yeast is used doesn't add much of an abbey/trappist flavor to the brew. That's too bad because certain trappist yeast strains might make this brew better. Still, this isn't a bad brew.

The first taste reminded of a Blackened Voodoo, but then, an overture of complexities took over. This is quite the brew! I almost always take 20-30 min. to consume 1 bottle when reviewing...and I'm glad I did. The warmer it got, the better it was. Usually, you get more alcohol forcing through, but not w/ this one.

When the head finally decides to fade, a two tiered lacing is left behind. That is, a somewhat thinner layer surrounding the glass sits atop a thicker layer that resided right above the brew. The smell of raisins, white grapes, grain, malt and an undercurrent of sweet syrup makes for intriguing contrasts. Tastes a bit sharper than the nose would lead you to believe, although the end is rounded off. A slight sweetness comes through just before the alcohol heat reveals itself. Dark chocolates and licorice lurk in the shadows. Carbonation is excellent and opens the beer up in your mouth making for a pleasant, almost airy mouth-feel.

The flavor was a bit of a disappointment, salty and sour at first followed by a very strong copper aftertaste. Good attempt at a Belgian strong, but I know that North Coast can do better. According to my dad this is a very good attempt at a common Belgian street ale (although being well traveled, and a great ""nose"" my dad drinks beer more for pure enjoyment at the moment rather than rating them like he does wine).

Purchased in a four pack of 12 ounce bottles, this deep colored dubbel style ale should be approached with respect. To drink more than one of these at a time just means you are seeking inebriation using, or should I say misusing, a very carefully and lovingly created ale, that is indeed a fitting tribute to the musical composer genius who was known as Thelonious Sphere Monk. There is big time complexity here: spicy with dark fruit notes, chocolate, vanilla and plum, to name just a few. Although I did not have a goblet present when I sampled this.

The beer pours a nice cloudy, tawny brown, with a caramel consistency, and a smallish head. The head dissipated quickly, no lacing either. The smell is caramelized, yeasty, perhaps a tinge of some fruits, such as apple, rind, and lemon. The beer is medium bodied and then it goes down hill fast. This beer does a terrible number in terms of masking its robust ABV, in fact, I got nothing but harsh, throaty alcoholish burn. The beer had none of the candied sugar fermentation, the sweet yeasty malts of a Belgian, or the complex fruity carbonation and warming notes. This beer just hit all the wrong notes. I drank a small glass and got rid of the rest. What a disappointement. It seemed that they just let this one ferment too long until it carmelized what should have been warming notes, and lost its redeeming Belgian character.","albern","Jan 04, 2008"

Lacing does not linger but the initial lacing is a complete curtain-like covering of the sides of the glass. Nose is pretty good, dark fruits, a little astringincy and alcohol. The St Bernadus is more complex. Brother Thelonius has the sweetness and dark fruit (plums and cherries) taste. It is missing the astringency and malty and astringent tastes that wend their wy through other Belgian style beers. Mouthfeel is rich. The alcohol taste is a bit too forward. Drinkability for a Belgian is fairly good...for beers in general, a bit lower based on abv.

Taste is quite malty with slight bitterness of figs/dates/sugar (although its not really that complex), fairly thin mouthfeel for a true dubbel. Its a good American Dubbel, but not extraordinary due to thin body and lack of complexity. The alcohol is handled fairly well with only a light phenolic taste coming through. I smile at a 9% dubbel.

The mouthfeel is dry, smooth, crisp, and mellow as Thelonious himself. A great fruity finish caps this one off, as well as a bit of bitterness.

(9%) the taste is even more complex. its similar..starts out more with the fruity part which mellows out and you can pick up on more of the yeast flavor. once again theres other flavors too here and there that i'm not sure what to liken them to. the flavor is a bit strong, but its very good. not something i would want to drink all night for sure. it was 7.99 for a 750ml bottle, not as expensive as some of the other large corked bottles, but i would say its up there with them in taste.","xgrafcorex","Jul 04, 2007"

It's full of malt flavor especially the crystal malts and a bit of special roast. It has a solid yeast fruitiness with a warm raisony finish. The mouthfeel is fine.

It really has a typical dubbel taste profile, but for some reason it deosn't seem as balanced as some better examples.

3.92,3.4,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"Pours a deep, rich burgundy tone, with a bubbly off-white head that dissipates quickly to a thin layer. Appears very effervescent. Spotty lacing in the goblet. The nose is of dark roasted malts, stewed fruits, sweet caramel, and some spice thrown in. Some alcohol in the nose. The palate is what you'd expect from the nose, and carries a very sweet, cloying flavor up front. A combination of the (very) active carbonation, high ABV, and a good, solid hop backbone, turn this brew quite a bit drier quickly, however. The palate is left somewhat decently balanced, but definitely leaning heavily toward the sweet side of things. Not unexpected for a dubbel, but maybe a bit too cloying. Mouthfeel is a tad sharp and biting, with an abundance of carbonation creating a froth in the mouth and revealing an aggressive alcohol burn. This aspect calms down as the beer warms from cellar temperature to ambient a bit. Finish is only semi-dry, with some sweetness lingering too long. Over all, not a bad dubbel, especially considering this is a domestic abbey-style ale. At 9% ABV, this one is no session beer. Worth a try, however, especially if you like the dubbel style. It's no Trappist ...but what else is?","beerphilosopher","Apr 06, 2007"

Taste is moderate grain upfront, quickly overpowered by some fruit tartness and drying alcohol, which warms the gullet as well. Mouthfeel seems a bit thin for such a substantial brew, and drinkability is really not that great.

Moderate bitterness with an extremely dry coffee-like finish. The mouthfeel lacks carbonation and is a touch watery. The high ABV is very evident and felt after about five sips. Lacks the typical Belgian Yeast aroma and taste I've come to expect and love with just a tiny showing in the taste. I think U.S brewers should leave Belgian Strong Ale's up to the Belgians. The is a feeble attempt to perfect greatness. After about five minutes the head completely dissapeared and gave it a look of flat cola. The cork gave a loud pop when opened so I know there was no leak that might lose carbonation. I wouldnt reccomend this and wouldn't try it again.

Maybe a passing wiff of chocolate, but is that the best this accomplished brewery can do? I expect more for the price. The taste is equally understated and unremarkable. Some maltiness but what is the dominate taste? Chocolate maybe? Nothing more than a hint of brown sugar. The mouthfeel was smooth and void of any hop bitterness. Some carbonation.

The cork and tie-down, the label, and 750 mil bottle all make a convencing Belgian look; even with a bit of sarcasm in the image. Pours a rich, rust color with a 50% haze and good head retention. Very sweet in the nose--some of malts, some of complimentary grains, sugars, and fruity esters. Tastes very sweet with barley malts, candy sugars, wheat malt, and an underlying confectionate sugar flavor. Balanced with a mild hop bitterness, alcoholic bite, and fruitcake variety. Still, lacking the complexity and true Belgian yeast characters. Not as tart or pepery as I like in true Belgian varieties. Just not funky enough. The feel is nearly sticky-sweet, rich, and full; helped out with some alcohol thinning, but remains very sweet well into the aftertaste. Overall, a fine brew, but cannot compete with the Belgian greats, especially for the price.","BEERchitect","Jan 28, 2007"

The beer poured a mahogany color and left a very thin layer of amber head atop a rather fragrant brew. The aromas are of citrus and carmel/toffee, this beer has that distinctive Belgian abbey ale fragrance. After the first sip, I could not help to say WOW! The glass has a very light layer of lacing. Brother Thelonius has a very distinct bing cherry overtones followed by the typical sweetness found in most dark Belgian ales. The 9% alcohol content is masked temporarily by the cherry flavors, but it is definitely present. My over all opinion of the North Coast Brewery is that they are amazing for an American brewery. I have been an avid fan of Red Seal Ale and Pranqster for several years, but this beer just put North Coast into my top ten favorite breweries. This beer comes highly recommended from me.","paulthebeerguru","Jan 23, 2007"

I paid $6.35 for a 750 corked and caged bottle of this while a four pack of the same breweries North Coast PranQster Belgian was only $6.85. They tasted very similar, the biggest difference being the higher alcohol content of Brother Thelonious. Poured a rich ruby red color and left a nice tan head and nice rings of lacing as it slowly settled. Nose is of yeast, flowers, malts, and hops, with banana.. Palate is of alcohol, and flavor is sweet and light hops which makes it really clean tasting and easy to drink. Finish is stongly of alcohol with a slight bitterness in the finish. Good brew and while I like it I can suggest saving a bunch of money like I said in the beginning of this review .

The burn was a bit too much for my liking and the mouthfeel was too strong with alcohol. I let the beer warm up a bit thinking I could get more of the underlying taste, but to no avail. I am a huge fan of North Coast, but this beer was just too abrasive for me. I took my time with this beer and eventually had to give the rest to my roommate.

Emerging are notes of raisons, plums, soft spice, smooth nutty malts, and the background buttery and toffeish. Increasing towards the end are spicy hop characters.

I'd like to see more maltyness in this one. The flavor is definately dominated with the esters, with the spiceyness associated with the yeast playing second string to this. The dark fruits from the malts are in the background, but still detectable. I was a little overwhelmed by the esters in this bottle. The feel is thick, with a lighter carbonation. It is not too filling though. Overall, this is not a bad beer at all. I have had it on tap and I would take that over the bottle any day, as it didn't seem to have the same estery profile.

The head stayed around for a long time, and left wonderful, thick lacing on the sides of the glass. Smell was sweet malts, alcohol, and stewed fruit, and in that order. Taste was aggressively sweet, followed by assertive alcohol. In fact, the finish, as well as the taste left in one's mouth several seconds after swallowing a sip, is quite alcoholic. Almost like someone took something like Gulden Draak and put just a pinch of sugar and a half a shot of vodka in it. I think this could benefit from lying down for 15 - 24 months. You could do much worse, and I certainly won't pour it away, but if I buy another, I'll cellar it for sometime.","SilentSabre","Aug 31, 2006"
3.75,-1.1,4,4,3.5,3.5,4,"The name is a nice memorial, but while the beer is fairly present, I can't help but feel it falls short of where they were aiming. The style itself sets some lofty expectations that many beers meet and exceed, but this one doesn't quite get there. Still, it mostly suffers by comparison. The ABV kicks and is hotly apparent, and serves a minor challenge to the drinkability. So, it's not as otherworldly as its namesake, and while that's to be expected, it's just not up to its name.","Foxman","Aug 31, 2006"

3.9,2.9,4,4,4,4,3.5,"This is quite an interesting take on this Belgian inspired brew. Quite a bit sweeter than many, though in truth I have had quite a few increasingly sweet examples from Belgium, so perhaps I should say it is sweeter than my favorite examples. This does strike a nice richness to it, and is quite an appropriate way to end off an evening of culinary indulgence. This beer hides its strength fairly well. Also it is fairly light despite the sweet fruit character. Certainly an enjoyable tipple and I think I might just need to stash a few of these away to see how they age over time.","Gueuzedude","Aug 20, 2006"

3.6,-5,4,4,3.5,3,3.5,"Out of the 750 ml. bomber, and into the St. Bernardus chalice, this Belgian style Abbey Ale poured out deep red. The head however was quite small, and not anything like the overflowing glass that Mr. Thelonious Monk is shown holding on the label. The aroma was a mix of floral and sweet smells, with a hint of spice. It smelled quite strong at first, but after starting the sipping, it became less aromatic. The taste was quite a bit tamer than the real Abbey Ales. I could detect some brow sugar, raisins, and chocolate, but everything was marred by the thin body, and the ever present alcohol. This beer was quite a bit less filling than I was hoping for, and lacked the complexity that the best Belgian style beers exhibit. On the plus side, it was quite easy to drink. In the end this felt like a sweet and alcoholic ale, with little else to remember it by.","rajendra82","Aug 18, 2006"
3.57,-5.8,3.5,4,3.5,3,3.5,"Taste is the same rich tones as the smell. Hint of alcohol, a bit of port. Lots of sour cherry and rich malt. A bit less body than you would expect. More medium bodied than heavy. The flavors don't quite mesh. Maybe with age? Mixed feelings on this one but not a bad Belgian-style American ale.","ViveLaChouffe","Aug 14, 2006"
4.15,9.5,4.5,4.5,4,4,4,"Pours a dark brown murky in appearance with a thin tan head. The aroma is brown sugar, cinnamon, cookies, vanilla, malty and fresh. The taste starts syrupy thick, with a pancake syrup sweetness balanced quickly with a bitter hop spiciness that is delicious. This is a quality brew but a little heavy on the sweetness needs more hop balance IMO but good brew overall.","Franchise","Aug 10, 2006"

Taste is a bit sour..cherry-like...alcohol elements..a bit harsher tha expected, expecially with the aromas present. Mouthfeel suffers from the alcohol notes and unexpected tartness. Drinkability also suffers because of the above mentioned characteristics. Not really a great value at $7.99 a bottle.

The smell is weak with only abit of candy sugar and malt detectable. The taste is malty with an alcohol presence along with dark fruit and a ""bisquity"" flavor. The m/f is light,but the flavors don't mix all that well. This is a beer that I was disappointed with.

Dark fruits, nothing too sweet, with some coffee notes in the background. Fair amount of malts and breadyness. Taste is kind of harsh, alcohol wise. More dark fruits, lots of malts, a bit of roastedness. This just tastes like it might be a bit too young, still a bit too harsh on the alcohol level. Mouthfeel is a bit thin for me, and flat-ish, but chewy enough. Drinkability wise, it's a Belgian, it doesn't suck, but it's just a bit too young...","scooter231","Jul 23, 2006"

Helps support Jazz Music by brewery making a donation for every case purchased. Pours medium brown, cloudy minor tan head, with so so retention, and just a wisp of lacing left. Nose here is milk chocolate and some raisins. Notes of bananas, chocolate, sweet bready malts. A bit on the sweet side, might benefit from some time in the bottle, still tasty and enjoyable, I'm a bit suprised by the low marks for this one, as somebody else noted, this one will benefit from some time to warm up. I'd like to try it with a chocolate dssert.","Billolick","Jul 08, 2006"
3.47,-8.4,3.5,4,3.5,3,3,"Aroma is nice Belgian ale style with raisins and dates and other dark fruits, sweet in its overall neighborhood. Flavor is much the same, nice, but a little too sweet. Considering the alcohol content (which I can feel in the back of my throat, much to my chagrin), it seems like it should be a little better developed than this. Maybe it's just too young. If it could turn some of these sugars into more complexity with time, this could be a really nice, affordable version of the style. Don't get me wrong, enjoyable now, but since I had (in my humble opinion) a world class BSDA recently, this one could use a little more complexity and excitement.","Dukeofearl","Jun 19, 2006"

This has just hit the shelves in SoCal; so perhaps some time in the bottle may diminish the sweetness, given the price its worth taking the chance to see if it does. By the way, I fucking hate Jazz.","TheLongBeachBum","May 17, 2006"
3.33,-12.1,2,4,3.5,2.5,3,"In the end, this is a beer that is so typical of American brewers - it is a misinterpretation of a Belgian... So many American-brewed Belgian-style beers don't have their yeasts pushed to their outer limits, so there's too much residual sugar, insufficient esters, and frequently, insufficient carbonation. Why do they do this? Are American brewers (outside of Vinnie and Tomme) really so cautious?","Crotor","May 17, 2006"

All the right flavors but way too subtle  candi sugar, raisins and bubble gum. Drinkability and mouthfeel were good which leads me to believe that this needs at least 6 months to come together.
