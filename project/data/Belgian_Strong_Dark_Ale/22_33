4.29,2.1,4.25,4,4.5,4.25,4.25,"O - a brilliant dark ale from Unibroue. This may be my favorite offering from them and that's saying something considering all the fine ales they bottle. Pure class of a brewery and their creative brewing and style are on full display with Maudite. Fantastic Belgian style ale.","BradtheGreat7","Sunday at 07:47 PM"

As I said, this one I could drink anytime, anywhere but I could really see it going good with mussels. Two thumbs up.","TheHammer","Friday at 07:35 PM"

Hovering at 8% ABV, it's on the lighter side of the BSDA game, and the body is so masterfully done that it feels like a 5% beer.

Nonetheless, for its availability and (relative) affordability, this beer and Unibroue in general are a great accessible way to scratch your Belgian itch.","Phocion","Nov 26, 2014"

An amber ale that focuses less on excessive hops and more on bringing out yeast esters and malt sweetness makes for a wonderful beer.

Some thick lacing is seen when sipped but then slides back down to leave spotty areas above the drink line. Lots of sediment is seen in the bottom of the bottle. Lots going on with the aroma as there is some sweet caramel malts, spice and yeast. Even more going on with the flavor with some light plum, pear and even banana. Finishes nicely that is actually pretty smooth with just a light sweet dry finish. A great brew but not a 'chugging' type by any means. Just kick back and enjoy this one.","BeerWithMike","Oct 06, 2014"

4.39,4.5,4.25,4.5,4.5,4,4.25,"Maudite poured a murky brown/amber colour, with plenty of small carbonation bubbles rising through the murkiness. Pouring produced about 1.5"" of long lasting beige coloured foam that eventually faded to a 1/8"" cap that lasted all the way down the glass, leaving some lacing and spotting as it retreated. The beer's aroma was of orange peel, spice and alcohol. Its taste began with orange...a sweeter orange at first which gave way to orange rind, followed by coriander, with a mildly bitter finish. As the beer warms its 8.0% alcohol becomes more noticeable. I would describe Maudite as medium bodied, with a crisp carbonation and creamy mouthfeel. Unibroue rarely seems to miss the mark, and they have another winner here. At $14.95 for a 6 pack, equal to $2.49 per bottle, Maudite is reasonably priced.","BuckyBeerBeaver","Jun 15, 2014"

The smell is captivating-- I can't stop swirling the glass and huffing the fumes. Flavor is a semi-dry and crisp mix of spices (coriander?) citrus (orange?) and sugary malt finish. Strong flavor with a tart edge but no excessive bitterness. Mouthfeel is effervescent with ample CO2 and a clean finish. Overall, a crisp, delicious belgian dark ale.","EagleTalon","May 15, 2014"

Spice jumps out in the smell, there is dark fruit, bread and plenty of that belgian yeast smell also.  Taste follows the smell with some clove in there that I had not noticed in smell.  Just a hint of hop bitter on finish.  Rather thin but pretty smooth.  Overall a very nice beer that I would throw in as Winter or Christmas due to the amount of spice.","JamieDuncan","Apr 18, 2014"

4.56,8.6,4,4.25,4.75,4.5,4.75,"A dark brown with orange highlights, this world class Belgian style dark generally yields a small amount of light butterscotch colored head and releases a complex aroma of sweet malt, molasses, citrus, spicy esters, and the faintest whiff of aromatic alcohols. The palate is deep dark complexity that somehow manages to make the aroma seem tame. I get molasses, chocolate brownie, a bouquet of spices including lemony coriander, cloves, nutmeg, and cinnamon, sour curry, dried dark fruits (raisin and prune), some overripe cherry notes, and some green hop flavors that appear after a few sips. Finish is sweet and rich, you will get tipsy if not careful as the alcohol is almost undetectable (had a bottle mid-afternoon for the purpose of writing this review and should have eaten more beforehand). In my view this is among the best beers in the world and is quite easy to track down here in the West. Compare with Chimay Grande Reserve and be surprised by how well this stacks up.","CalgaryFMC","Sep 14, 2013"

Stepping a little bit out of my comfort zone with this one as Belgians are not my usual go tos. This beer looks great when poured though; rich amber that freely effervesces and keeps a thin, but perpetual head. Smell is dry, hints of vanilla, green apples, bananas, coriander and yeast. The taste brings more of the apple tartness, with some spice, and a hint of caramel sweetness. No real hops to speak of. Notes of bread are left on the pallet. Medium bodied, crisp, and a touch tart and very easy to drink. Some warming from the alcohol but no booze in any part of the profile. Terrific beer.","Samuel906","Aug 19, 2013"

Complex with lots of Belgian yeast dominant. Thick fruits and a little spice. The sweet malt in the background comes to the nose like temptation. The hops are revealed on the palate floral and herbal. The malt is especially deep and full. Peaks smoothly with moderate carbonation and devilishly plays tricks in the glass with a slight reddish tint. Not too heavy to enjoy and lightly boozy at 8%. It’s demure but not afraid. What a wonderful way to keep your eyes on heaven.","utopiajane","Jun 11, 2013"

The last time I had a Belgian style red ale this good was when I was in Belgium. The beer pours smoothly into your tulip ale glass with a substantial head and a bouquet of early sumer floral tones that whet the palate for its imminent arrival. A sip will not last long, as you will want to recharge your tastebuds posthaste and repeatedly. The colour, as you would expect, is on the red side of amber, but not crystal clear, nor too cloudy. As you can probably tell I liked this beer a lot and will search high and low for in on my many road travels. Frankly, I've had three different Unibroue beers over the past several days and they have all been brilliant.","AlfaMale","May 23, 2013"

They do Belgian styles wonderfully, perhaps the best outside of Belgium (though perhaps Ommegang and certainly Allagash could give them a run for their money). They are always very true to style, and Maudite is no different, and the price point cannot be beat next to the Belgian imports. This sampler pack was an excellent decision, and I encourage all those not on the Unibroue love-train to buy it or throw caution to the wind and purchase four four-packs of Maudite, La Fin du Monde, Trois Pistoles, and Don de Dieu. 17.5/20","THANAT0PSIS","May 07, 2013"

Taste is of roasted caramel malt, yeast, dark fruit of plums with some bitter notes. A full bodied brew on the palate, nicely balanced with good carbonation and a slightly smooth mouth feel. Finish is roasted caramel malt, yeast, bready, with some dried fruit flavor with some bitter notes ending is slightly lingering sweet alcohol.

There are lots of visible bubbles in this beer, which is expected for a bottle conditioned beer. The beer has the classic Belgian dark ale aroma with those fruity esters that give off smells of apple and pear. I get some sweetness from the malt and those cloves. I don't pick up much booziness in the smell. The taste closely follows the nose. The dark malts, spices, and Belgian yeast deliver the desired flavors here. I get those fruits and the bready and malty sweetness. It is not too cloying in the mouth. The body is medium with lively carbonation. The finish is clean and this is easy to drink for such a big beer. This is a very good beer. It is a solid representation of the style.","acevenom","Oct 03, 2012"

3.99,-5,3,4,4,4.5,4,"Maudite pours a fairly clear chestnut, with some burnt orange highlights. There's two to three fingers of cream colored foam crowning the beer, but head retention is average and lacing isn't there at all. The nose has lots of fruit present, plum and figs and even some banana. There's also a firm supporting note of clove and pepper. The flavor profile leads off with all those dark fruits and banana from the nose, everything coming across as being a bit more intense than in the nose. The spicy phenols follow, similarly flavorful, but the beer finishe rather abruptly, rather than a graceful exit. The body is light and nicely dried out, and the carbonation, while very active, feels like it has rounded edges, and is fair to describe as creamy. Maudite isn't quite perfect, but it's a very good Belgian Strong Dark Ale from a brewery that's as locked in on Belgian style beers as any on this continent.","axeman9182","Apr 28, 2012"

The smell, however, is very complex - hints of sour cherry sit atop a strong yeast component with nice malt base. The taste is incredible and very closely follows the smell. It's perfectly balanced. Wow. The mouthfeel is great too - very dry, yet creamy. I'm lucky to have this brewery so close to my house. Since it's so prevalent around here I'll definitely be buying this again.","Intrinsic","Mar 25, 2012"

4.2,0,4,4,4.5,4,4,"750 ml bottle into signature tulip glass, best by 4/6/2014. Pours slightly hazy reddish orange color with a foamy 2 finger off white head with good retention that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Slight spotty lacing on the glass. Aromas of big apple, banana, pear, plum, apricot, grape, molasses, pepper, clove, biscuit, citrus peel, candi sugar, and yeast spices. Nice and well balanced aromas with good complexity. Taste of apple, pear, grape, banana, raisin, pepper, clove, biscuit, candi sugar, molasses, and yeasty spices. Lingering notes of pear, apple, grape, pepper, and yeast spices on the finish for a bit. Great balance and complexity in the flavor; with no cloying sweetness at all. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a fairly creamy and chewy mouthfeel. Alcohol is well hidden at 8% with no alcohol noticed at all really. Very smooth to drink but is still definitely a sipper. Overall this is an excellent and very enjoyable Belgian ale as expected from Unibroue. Nice complexity and great balance; with smooth drinking for the level of alcohol.","superspak","Mar 24, 2012"

Good spicy kick leads off the beer, clove, typical spice flavors found in belgians, as well as some cracked pepper and yeasty notes. The spices turns into a sweet, fruity malt. Big pear notes and some apple flavor as well. Nice. Finishes dry with a really bubbly mouthfeel. Lighter, fruitier version of the style, especially compared to Trios Pistoles, but a welcome take on the style.","uustal","Mar 05, 2012"

Currently we have bottles as old as 1998 and presently drinking a 2005. In recent years this beer as disappointed me as young bottles are more a kin to spice soup. Older bottles turn into a spicy Madeira sipper tonight although this bottle had a big pop and poured with a great big head it seems a bit oxidised oh well the price was right.","hoser","Jan 02, 2012"

The nose, while not bad, is a little on the light side for me. I get malt, orange, pear, plum, spices, and a hint of caramel. The taste is a little bit better. In addition to the nose profile, the yeast is present in the taste. Like all Unibroue beers, this one isn't quite up to the best from Belgium. It's too dry, and not complex enough in the flavor profile for me personally. Still, it's a solid beer. Feel is medium, with a nice malt backbone and good carbonation. Overall, a good beer- but in a tough style category... you can easily find better. Cheers.","jayhawk73","Dec 16, 2011"

I'd probably rather have a Chimay Red... and I guess that explains why this solid beer won't be getting a score with an A in it from me.","UTCengOwl","Oct 10, 2011"
4.05,-3.6,3.5,3.5,4.5,4,4,"This sure is a spicy Belgian! The first tastes I get are sweet toasted malts, and spices that remind me a lot of wintertime cookies.

The aroma offers yeast, pears, alcohol, light spices. The flavor follows suit, with a strong apple / pear presence. Yeast is there, but plays a secondary role. Malt and spices meld nicely with the fruit flavors. Brown sugar and caramels emerge more as the beer warms. The beer warms the throat and chest in the finish, with a delicate alcohol presence.

Carbonation throughout the entire volume with a generous and fluffy head too. Smell is mild hops balancing sweet malts. Exceptionally clean. Wish there was a bit more yeast character in the nose of this one. Bitter sweet with layers of complexity at the first sip. Wonderful taste in the great tradition of Corsendonk and others.

Aroma of caramel maltiness and bready yeast. I didn't really get the fruity taste that many other people seem to be getting from this. Rather, a clean nuttiness with some subtle spice, cloves and aromatic wood. A little bit flat and woody. But it's still good, and goes extremely good with Oreos, I discovered.

4.25,1.2,4.5,4.5,4,4,4.5,"During my early birthday steak celebration, this was my beer of choice (a complete shock that stuff like this and Bernardus 12 were even available, and on draft no less!). It pours a cloudy amber-tawny topped by a healthy finger of off-cream foam. The nose comprises bready Belgian yeast, figs, black pepper, cardamom, nutmeg, candi sugar, mandarin oranges, clove, light banana, and a touch of red apples. The taste tones things down a bit, focusing on the yeast, the figs, the clove, the pepper, and the nutmeg. A touch of apple-y fruitiness comes through as well, diluted a bit by some red grapes, but this is secondary to everything else. The body is a hefty-leaning medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a feel that longs to be as chewy as it feels it is (if that makes sense...).

The head is a lighter off white color with close to one finger in height, it sticks around for a while and laces some as well. The beer smells very Belgian in nature with darker fruits and spiciness. Smell faintly reminds me of a cabernet. Breadiness is more apparent in the taste, with the spicy, dark fruits still available. Great carbonation that dances around quite well, and for an extended period. Overall a very enjoyable beer, in the Belgian Strong Dark style that is becoming one of my favorites.

The aftertaste seems to make the salivary ducts under my tongue drool, tho maybe that's just because I want another swallow real soon. The yeast is so strong here that malt barely peeks out, and the hops don't show up till a few moments after swallowing. A mouthful held before swallowing blossoms with thick creamy foaming ale joy that you might imagine a bit too sweet and yeasty, but when swallowed it all goes down clean as a flash of orange brown light.","jameswaldo","Apr 14, 2011"

Scent is big on the carmel and fresh yeasty bread, very pastry like, notes of watery fruit and some light roasted nut. Taste was not as sweet as expected, instead the taste of dark baked white bread is about even with the sweet carmel notes, again watery dark fruit and roasted nuts present. Medium bodied, lighter carbonation for bottle conditioned. A nice beer that doesnt overdo the sweetness but maintains a big malt profile.","rfgetz","Mar 01, 2011"
3.95,-6,4,4,4,3.5,4,"Poured from a bottle into a tulip, the beer has a hazy, ruby-brown coloring with a thin layer of dense bubbled foam that starts around an inch thick and quickly recedes to a filmy covering. Aromas are fantastic! Good, sweet blending of caramel malty notes, with a great balance of pretty strong coriander characteristics. Also some hints of dark fruit sweetness buried in the smells. The beer is initially very light on the tongue, and quickly unfolds to a crisp, spicy-malt blend that is a little roasty/toasty sweet, while at the same time slightly sour with a heavy undertone of coriander and nutmeg spice. The lightness of the body does a good job to keep the flavors from being overpowering. The beer transitions to a slightly sour and spiced aftertaste, and a moderately lingering finish. It definitely doesn't let you forget what you are drinking, and makes a great sipping beer. The body, despite being light, reveals a decent lacing on the glass as you get towards the bottom, also. Impressive. A little lighter and bubbly than my preference for the style, but impressive nonetheless.","GarthDanielson","Feb 28, 2011"

The hops are not very noticeable and if you are a big IPA fan you may not really appreciate this one.

4.04,-3.8,4,5,3.5,4,4,"Overall, the best thing about this brew is its fresh aroma. While related, it is almost more reminiscent of a Belgian tripel, rather than a strong dark ale. It remains clean, spicy, and vibrantly complex, with a nice helping of sweet, balancing esters. When you then taste, it is almost underwhelming. You are expecting this creamy and sweet, yet spice-laden brew, but are presented with something a bit lighter and less robust than one would expect.","TheBrewo","Dec 15, 2010"

The smell was citrus herbal tones of malt and bread with a small amount of alchohol in the nose.

The beer smelled wonderfully complex with clove and banana aromas that opened up as the beer sat. A deeper smell pulled up some toasty biscuit and sweet caramel malts. This complexity was reciprocated in the taste: assertive spice, with fig-like fruit that provided a flavor without the sweetness. The body was full despite high attenuation.

This beer smelled of yeast, and some fruityness. It tastes of darker fruits, malt, a little bit of yeast, and some spicyness. This beer is light with lots of carbonation.

The taste is sticky and malty up front with banana and yeast being dominant, some slight sweet honey and mild bitterness are in the finish with a dry alcohol after taste.

Medium mouthfeel sweet up front and in the middle, again with a nod to apples, with very little bitterness in the back end. Lots of carbonation bite.

Ripe dark fruit pops up first in the flavor, with plenty of estery sweetness. The perceived sweetness fades into the dry, yeasty flavors. Hops are muted, some herbal flavors, but it is hard to distinguish them from the earthy flavors from the yeast. The alcohol is well hidden.

Also has some clove and other spice. Smells fairly malty. The flavor is much more heavy on the clove and pepperyness. Fruit definitely takes a back seat, but there are still pear, sour apple and blackberry notes. Malty, but balanced with a sourness that gives this beer a pretty good finish. The body is medium with somewhat spiky carbonation and really does not do anything for me. I would say drinkability is just okay, as the alcohol shines through more than I would like. This is a solid beer, but not a great one.","zoso1967","Apr 01, 2010"

Taste is the real treat here. Fruit tones abound, though it is difficult to discern. Nice and malty is what comes to my mind. Carbonation gives this a nice, tingly feel, seems to dance on the the taste buds. Feels mighty light for a strong ale, though it is highly drinkable because the alcohol content is well masked.

Taste is great, reminds me of a BSDA combined with a tripel. Apple, pear, raisins, sweetness, light spicy yeast, floral notes. Alcohol well-hidden.

The tartness surfaced mid-palate and stayed through the finish, which didn't taste as alcoholic (or leave warmth) like Trois Pistoles did, e.g. the alcohol content was very well disguised.

The smell is very malty and full of dark fruitiness, with hints of fig and dark cherries with some brown sugar. As it warms, the alcohol scent and a sort of spiciness, like a cinnamon, becomes detectable. The taste is full of the fruits with a slight breadiness from the malt and yeast. At 8%, the alcohol can be tasted pretty easily. The mouthfeel is smooth and light; not much carbonation going on throughout the ale. There is a tiny bit of bitterness that coats the tongue, but not one that is overpowering. And to end it all, the alcohol warmth comes in.

The taste is hugely complex without being overwhelming. There's an ethereal alternating fruitiness and spice that's difficult to put my finger on or call out as specific flavors that accurately describe it. It's also worth noting that even though this beer weighs in at 8% I was barely able to detect any alcohol at all. The mouthfeel is thick and almost chewy with a decent amount of carbonation.

Aroma of dark fruits. In the snifter, everything was overwhelmed by the carbonation as beer turned to foam as it hit my mouth. If I had drank this entirely out of a snifter, I would have rated it about 2.5. In a glass, I tasted plums and cola. Feel, nothing but carbonation in the snifter, nothing special in the glass. Good drinkability, only in the glass. Maudite is remarkable similar to Trappistes Rochefort 8, which I was not overly impressed with.

The head hung around all too briefly, which was another surprise: in this style I think I've seen better. But these are piddly concerns. The aroma is thick with yeast, orange and apricots, and the taste hits hard with all kinds of things: malt, fruit, bread, even a few mushrooms. Dense body, cloudy orangish in color and lightly fizzed. There was a bit of lemon at the back but otherwise very little hop taste. Worth the price in any size.","gfreed","Jul 19, 2009"

Overall a very drinkable beer, but I'm not sure it's one of Canada's best. A bit too malty and kind of boring, if you ask me. I think Dieu Du Ciel pulls off the Belgian style much better than Unibroue, mostly by adding more hops to their beers.

The carbonation on this beer and pretty much all Unibroue beers is huge, I usually swirl my glass around for a long time trying to tame it.

Little aftertaste and balanced flavors on the tongue are a plus, even as the throat feels the gentle heat that its name implies. Spices abound in the tastebuds, with a bit of cinnamon, nutmeg, and a few unidentifiable bits taking the flavor to a complexity most winter warmers would dream of--no syrupy drip or spruce tree pine corniness here... I could see this beer posessing a dinner-table versatility as well as being a desertif.

The taste is nice, wheat that has a toasted character, fruit, clove and a slightly banana yeast flavor. Some alcohol flavor as the brew warms.

A mix of sweet malts and some bread/yeast aromas peek through, along with some very light hops. This ale is unbelievably smooth and creamy, never had a Belgian that I could say was this smooth. Sweet malts like caramel and maybe something like gum/cake icing (sugary) along with toffee or roasted malts to keep it balanced and give it a dry backbite. Also contained citric and dark fruit tastes in the hops; I could detect orange and possibly banana but I couldn't decipher the rest.

Had I not already seen the 8% ABV on the bottle, I probably would've figured it out from the scent alone. Taste is very complex. Sweet and light. The alcohol content isn't nearly as recognizable in the taste as it is the smell. I think the mouthfeel is excellent. The collection of small bubbles caress the tongue and throat, and the beer leaves a slight spicy aftertaste.

It was somewhat thick with some carbonation, and had a lasting bitter aftertaste. Overall this had a fairly complex and clean flavor, although it had too much sour yeast for my liking.

The taste is similar: Malty and sweet. Some caramel, some bitterness, and yeast rounds out the taste. Not a very strong taste of alcohol. Very well balanced taste. A fizzy mouthfeel that leaves some stickiness but drinks real easy. I will definitely buy some of this...it's a delicious beer and easy to drink.","mtbbaboon","Oct 14, 2008"

Poured a murky plum color with a two inch rocky off-white cap. A furious, initial effervescing of tiny bubbles began to slow in tandem with the subtle collapse of the head, which eventually settled into a fairly consistent skim of foam. Some lacing present during the tasting, but poor adhesion. Complex nose; dark fruit (perhaps prunes & plum) as well as a spicy character and perhaps a hint of candi sugar. Taste follows nose with some citrus astringency revealed, culminating in a dry finish. Mouthfeel is between light- and medium-bodied but seems to be slightly overcarbonated.

Various dark fruit syrups mixed with Robitussin. Slightly astringent finish. Warming. Full body with good carbonation.

A quick coffee snap at the beginning, then black pepper, toasted malts, balancing hops, some citrus and general fruit. Exactly what a Belgium strong should be. Smooth, med to light carbonation and easy to drink. Lingering finish. Especially because you can't tell how strong it is. Goddamn. A beer for all occasions and all drinkers.

4.97,18.3,4.5,5,5,5,5,"I love everything about this beer - the taste, the appearance, the macabre label. Unibroue does everything right with this brew. It pours an impenetrable dark brown color that takes on an almost plum color in the glass. There is a slight head which evaporates quickly leaving a bit of lacy head retention. The nose is very fruity, with pear and apple notes as well as a peppery spiciness. The taste reflects the excellence I have generally come to expect from Unibroue. It has a complex but perfectly balanced flavor that contains fruit notes, bread maltiness and hints of clove and nutmeg. The finish is fruity, with a slight hint of wood. This is a fine example of a traditional Belgian Ale and a really satisfying beer. In spite of the high ABV, I could see myself drinking this as a session beer.","jenbys2001","May 05, 2008"

Typical aromas of Belgian yeast with a bit of spice, some coriander, and pepper as well as a nice breadiness. Quite carbonated, and thge taste is a little thinner and spicier than I'd like. A bit more breadiness and even a bit more sweetness would be welcome. Quite spicy with pepper, more coriander, and orange peel. Quite herbal and very drying on the finish.

The Maudite poured into my tasting snifter a deep mahogany with a foamy vanilla head. The aroma was fruity with hints of dates and figs. The taste was spicy and sweet with a champagne-like finish, probably due to the yeast used. There is a bitterness quality to Maudite but not overpowering. It almost reminds me of a ""light"" Barleywine. It has the same aroma and flavor characteristics, but isn't as dark or deep. Maudite is definitely worth your time.","steelcutoats","Feb 19, 2008"
4.63,10.2,4.5,4,5,5,4.5,"Wow, what a surprise. I've had the other Unibroue beers and I bought this to round out the experience. I didn't realize this was a Belgian, and what a fine Belgian it is. The beer pours a nice brown, tawny color with a nice thick, creamy, off white head that retains and laces. The smell is candied sugar malts, some spices, typical Belgian yeasty aromas, only not excessively. The smell is the low point, and at a 4, it isn't that low. The beer is a full bodied, slightly syrupy, thick, and very complex Belgian. The taste is just wonderful. You get the full gamut of candied sugar malts, Belgian yeastiness, a slight fizzy snap, lots of apple, coriander, clove, and maybe a touch of dark fruits all nicely settled in. What makes this just an exceptional beer is that you'll get none of the heavy ABV throatyness found in so many other other thick syrupy Belgians. This one does an incredible job masking it all over. The 8% ABV comes through ever so slightly on the very tail end, but that's all. In addition, you can expect some caramel malts, some peppery bite, some citrusy tang, and God knows whatever else. The style is great and this beer is about as good a representation of the style as you'll find. This one is well worth seeking out. L'Chaim.","albern","Feb 19, 2008"

It has a nice slightly off-white head that leaves good lacing and keeps a thin layer above the beer. The smell is of fruit, malt, and various spices: cinnamon, cloves and pepper even. The taste mirrors the aroma but displays even greater depth and complexity. As the beer warms up, it becomes a bit spicier (originally poured at 52 faren.).

There so much going on with the taste, but the flavors are all very subtle -- fruity, citrusy, with the finish of the spiciness from the aroma and a hint of hop bitterness.

3.92,-6.7,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"A great Belgian brew, bottles ""on lees"" as the label has it. Pours a light yeast-cloudy brown with a thick, persistent, head, that leaves more lace behind that a showgirl revue. Spicy malty aroma that segues into a big malty flavor with just enough tartness and active carbonation to keep it from seeming heavy. The 8% ABV is well hidden, and the carbonation and spicy yeast tartness make it dangerously drinkable. All in all a very well done Belgian.","MillRat","Nov 08, 2007"

The mouthfeel is smooth, flavours are big and nicley in-sych and there is a warm rye or malt whisky backdrop, all of it held together nicely considering the high alcohol content.

The body was initially very clear until I got around to the clouded yeasty pour. It looked reddish amber in color, and amply carbonated, forming a three finger head readily before the glass was fully filled. Aromatically, this was a mild beer, as the light spicing, nutty malt, and musky yeast smells were all quite subtle and well blended. The taste was quite dry and and rather spicy with a lot of clove and and saffron flavors. A touch of sourness and warm alcohol showed up in the finish. Very light and lively on the palette as a result of the carbonation. A little different take on the Belgian Strong Ale category, as this came somewhere between the sneaky beers like Duvel, and the very overt beers like most Quads.","rajendra82","Sep 14, 2007"
4.83,15,5,4.5,5,4.5,5,"Poured into a goblet, Maudite is truly a beautiful thing. The deep red brown color is actually a close match to the walnut desk I'm sitting at as I type this. A quickly forming light, fluffy 1"" head dies down and leaves a delicate scalloping around the perimeter of my glass... Fruits abound in the nose and I can smell a lot of banana, pineapple, and maybe a little grape. Cloves also come into play, and with the aroma of yeasty bread, the different fruity esters all come together wonderfully... All that description of smell and yet the taste is what truly makes this beer one of the most complex I've ever tasted. I get all the fruit and hints of the hop character right off the bat. While these flavors meld and then melt away, the cloves slide in riding the slightly elevated ABV, bringing a pleasant spiciness to the whole mouth. As I exhale, the heat and the spices stick around while the fruitiness, slight hoppiness and that distinct yeasty bread vibe make a triumphant return... The complexity of flavors, combined with the light tingly carbonation create a tremendously harmonic mouthfeel, helping to make this the most drinkable Belgian style beer I've had to date...","beergynt","Sep 13, 2007"

Starts with a fruity (banana) taste, a slight taste of alcohol, and some yeast. Then it takes a complete 180 and has a great malt taste as it goes down. My very first sip it was almost hefe like but ended up like a amber. Great aftertaste, somewhat high in carbonation and that adds a nice crisp element to it.

Rocky soap-bubble head finally settles to a one finger cap and holds well but leaves poor lacing. Spicy belgian phenolics and ripe tropical fruit aromas like orange peel and apricot, with toasty malt and rose alcohol in the background. Sweet pale malt and mild steely caramel upfront, followed by the typical phenols of the propriatory Unibroue strain; peach and apricot, white pepper, hints of coriander and melon, etc. Their house yeast is not for me; as usual it lends a particularly dry and boozey aftertaste that mutes the delicate noble hop flavor and the alcohol warmth is more obvious than it should be for 8% ABV. However, the mouthfeel is again quite nice, and as the bottle states, even smoother than usual. Sugar thinned body with ample carbonation to help cleanse the palate and keep the malt and yeast character from becoming distracting. Finishes dry and a little boozey but fairly clean, a respectable drinkability. Not exactly a textbook Strong Dark Belgian ale; and the yeast accent is less aggresive than most of the Unibroue line. Some people will appreciate that fact and find this a milder but still complex and fair-balanced choice in the Unibroue line-up.","PBRstreetgang","Jun 30, 2007"

The only disappointing element is that the alcohol is not all that well hidden (Rochefort 10 at 11.3% hides it's alcohol better).

The caramel comes through in a big way, and the breads provide a strong background for it all to rest on. A bit of grain and lots of spiciness in the finish, though a bit of alcohol shows as well.

The assualt on my palate was total- sweet malts and a huge, sour, flowery yeast character followed by a spiced aftertaste. Body was light and alcohol undetectable.

I unfortunately don't have the proper glassware for a beer of this style so it was consumed in the traditional pint glass, and for that I am sorry. First thing I noticed was the aroma. The aroma does not match the flavor at all in my opinion. The closest way for me to describe the aroma is to say it smelled like wort during the boil. If you have homebrewed, or taken a brewery tour, then this will hopefully make sense. The aroma smelled somewhat hoppy, maybe a little earthy. The flavor though, was pure Belgian delight. It has a fairly malty backbone, with a hint of sourness, and a nice touch of hops. Taste had a hint of alchohol hotness present, reminding the drinker that this is a higher ABV beverage. You definitely do get a nice mellow warming feeling while drinking this. Color is a somewhat dirty brown, very hazy, and fairly carbonated.

This poured a gorgrous hazy as hell brown with a gigantic head that tapered as it grew because of the glass. The head did not go down for about 7 minutes which kinda pissed me off but gorgeous nonetheless! The aroma was huge on the malt and was incredibly fruity and yeasty. There was also a hint of caramel and clove. There was not much in terms of hoppage but thats allright as there was plenty of happy spice and yeast to keep it plenty interesting. Alcohol is simply not detectable, at 8%. There was also a yummy hint of banana. The mouthfeel was moderately carbonated but not too much. The feel was slick and chewy. I could down a whole 4 pack of this with no problem. All of the Unibroue brews seem to share that quality.

Has a nice complexity with caramel, esters, and some sort of spice. Maybe a little like nutmeg, it is perfectly balanced.

Smells of that Unibroue yeast which is along the lines of a pear sweetness with an almost powdery sugar air to it. Like most Unibroue beers the yeast takes center stage with other flavors rounding it out. This one has a light citrus throughout that becomes more apparant as it warms, like biting into a boozy pear. There is a little bit of alcohol warmth, but it seems to aid the taste and the mouthfeel. Nice carbonation throughout.

Taste is pleasant with biscuity malt up front, fruity ale yeast in the middle and a a dry light hop finish.

Smells like all good belgians, fruity with yeasty notes but this one also possessed some unusual earthy woody notes as well which make it especially appetizing. Taste is huge and bold with floral yeasty notes up front and followed by a darker more malty finish. Full of complex suggestions of spices, in a way reminding me of a belgian style american winter warmer, if that makes any sense. Finish is alcoholic and peppery, very warming although eight percent is fairly high, i'm definitely feeling it a bit more than I would expect.

4.12,-1.9,4,4.5,4,4,4,"From the 750ml bottle...amazing picture-label as always. The cage over the cork says this is the 2005 edition. This is one of those Unibroue beers I drink all the time, and yet I had never reviewed it. Maudite pours into my chalice glass smoothly, creating a puffy but fizzy and large-bubbled head. Why is it I can never get a good, creamy head from any of the Unibroue beers anymore? They all seem way too fizzy, and then they recede to a very thin covering...my glass is clean, etc, etc. The head is a bone-white colour. Big webs of lacing. The beer's colour is wonderful: a light chestnut, reddish honey hue. I love Maudite's spicy/sweet aroma. The aroma also possesses tree bark, or even oak. A solvent pungency lurks in the background. Big wafts of perfume, of yeast, red licorice, vanilla wafer, and roasted malts. The alcohol is really quite hard to find at all in the smell. In closer the beer exudes a very strong meaty smell, like roasted beef. Other aromas: light honey, cereal cream, nutmeg, chestnuts, cinnamon, caramel, and bitter chocolate/mocha coffee. The hops are quite strong when the beer warms more, coming through as hemp or marijuana. There exist also some aromas quite hard to define, which keeps me smelling the beer throughout the bottle. Complex. A fine smelling Belgian dark. The earthy tree bark exists for me in the taste too. Up front the beer gives spicy warmth, light hopping, and some meaty malts. The middle adds the honey-like sweetness, and the finish is all about the malts and a certain dry graininess. Not quite as fulfilling as the aroma, but nice. The floweriness comes through in the taste, as does a metallic nuance. Pairing it with 2-year aged cheddar mellows the spiciness and the bitterness, and really enhances the malts nicely. Also paired it with Danish havarti, but the beer was a little overpowering for it--it was still good though. The mouthfeel is not quite as thick as I should like--this is more medium-bodied. A warming beer, and with little astringency of alcohol, Maudite is very drinkable. Another feather in the cap of Unibroue.","Cwrw","Dec 22, 2005"

Further again candysugar and koreander that's majorly there again. Not overdone but nice and clean bitterness with it and showing good brewerskills. Fine mouthfeel also except the IMO overdone spicyness of the koreander. For the rest a great brew though that's quiet impressive to me.

Unibroue manages to pack all of this elusive fruitiness into one tightly packed, refined little package. Mouthfeel is champagne smooth and dry. Insanely drinkable for 8%.

I almost did not know where to being with this one. Starts off malty sweet and nicely envelopes the mouth. The maltiness is then replaces by some spicy sharpness. A little hop flavour as well to keep things in check. Overall one hell of a Belgian. If I didnt know any better I would say this definately came from the Continent.

The taste is a combination of dried fruit with a slight caramel aftertaste and alcohol warming sensation. The taste is not overpowering but definitely an acquired taste especially since the alcohol makes itself known up-front.

Being classified as a Belgian Specialty, there are a whole lot of other really complex beers that we have to put this beer against. It is pretty good, but it only has a few prominent dimensions of flavor. It has some sweet caramel, some fruity esters, and a touch of spice.

The yeast makes an appearance to add some dimension and sharp spiciness as well, and the breadiness ties everything together. There is certainly some sugar in the back too.

Tropical fruits blend with crisp lemony citrous and waltz with bready malts, also some peppery spicy notes, with a touch of alcohol thrown in for good measure. The taste is damn complex - where to begin? Malts are big and form a bready, toasty backbone. Some semisweet caramel is present as well. Prickly lemon and bitter orange peel hops are strong but do not take control of your palate. Instead they fade into candy sugar and a spiciness that leads into the slight alcohol flavor. Also present is some banana and clove flavors, and a touch of yeastiness. Mouthfeel is very complex - creamy malts lay it down smooth, but the hops are very exciting to the tongue. Very nice and full. Drinkability is top notch, a devil of a brew. Maudite? Well I guess I am damned then.","BeerFink","May 02, 2005"

I have increased my previous ratings for smell and taste upon trying it again. The fruits really stand out and the aroma is more than pleasant. Taste was much better as well. The mouthfeel is the same as a result of the high ABV leaving my mouth a little dry. The presence of alcohol also keeps the drinkability down. Towards the end of the beer you realize that it gets increasingly difficult to finish, but is still enjoyable.

The yeast provides the perfect base for the myriad flavors that begin to emerge as this ale warms. I taste wheat, white grapes, mango, plum, nectarine. I taste perfectly placed hints of spices: ginger, cardamom, cloves. The hops, yeast and malt are perfectly balanced in this ale. Of course, I may be a bit biased, as this is my favorite style by far.

4,-4.8,4,4,4,4,4,"Popped the cork out of the 750ml champagne bottle and it flew across the room above the Thanksgiving turkey. Poured into my Duvel tulip glass a dark brown hue that becomes more and more murky as it nears the bottom of the bottle, almost like apple juice. Great carbonation - tiny, tiny bubbles just keep on coming. Slighly sweet aroma of roasted malt, prunes, brown sugar, light hoppy bitterness, and some serious alcohol. Incredibly complex palate. Notes of brown sugar, sweet malt, dark, sweet fruit, and earthy yeast. Highly alcoholic finish is very warming. Mouthfeel is thick and slightly syrupy, very nice for the style. Takes a while to drink, but is imminently satisfying even an hour after pouring.","ElGordo","Nov 25, 2004"

Aroma is very complex with sweet malts and a lot of alcohol and yeast fruitiness. The flavor is a rush of a barely perceptible hop bitterness and a sweet malt flavor balanced by a dry estery finish that has a lingering alcohol prescence and a mineral water like taste. The mouthfeel has a fine belgian style carbonation that rushes a lot of small bubbles all over your tongue without having the bite of arificially carbonated beverages. The body of this ale also has a Belgian feel to it too as I am sure they achieved the high alcohol of this brew using kettle sugars. Very drinkable on a cold night when this ale is at about 50 degrees F and poured into a snifter like glass it is very expressive of it's flavors yet has a refined balance.","RenoZymurgist","Nov 12, 2004"

Rather fruity, maybe taking on fresh fig, mango and pear, very subtle vegetal notes, too. Alcohol is pretty well hidden, which is a plus.

Definitely suggests a larger serving due to complexity. Good lord does it make you feel good, too! Smooth, not too carbonated, creamy. A simply fun aftertaste.

Spice is the dominant flavor, a little more balance would be nice, speaking of balance, no alcohol was detectible, and just a very little hop at the finish. With the flavor mostly being spice I would have given it less than a 4, but for some reason the spice can earn a 4 all on it own, with out the help of other flavors.

The flavor also was a bit small but along with the fragrance it grew as the bottle warmed. The good thing about the larger bottles is that they last long enough for you to get the variations from change in temperature. The taste was spicy with a variety of fruit accents swirling around.

The amount of lacing was disappointingly minimal. The bouquet is, well, yummy to smell. Notes of spiced cake soaked in cola, hints of pepper, faint suggestions of bubblegum and bananas, a vague hint of alcohol as well. The potency is modest but it gets its point across: inviting. The palate has a lot going on, at times the maltiness is very cake-like and yet at other times it is toasted biscuits. When the cake speaks up I noticed the alcohol more, conversely when the biscuits shine I noticed a basket of fruit lead by green apples, bananas, and array of tropical fruit. No matter the malt construction the spiciness is solid throughout, pleasantly peppery. This is obviously a well-crafted beverage. The carbonation is big and forceful, maybe a little too much so, it is around medium in body, I found it just a tickle too thin but not enough to downgrade it. The 8% abv seems very appropriate for this beer, it is big enough to add complexity but low enough to quaff a few, granted you would feel it. Maudite is a highly drinkable beer; it is another winner from Unibroue. I wish I could drink this regularly; I purchased this 750 ml in Kansas City.

Aftertaste was kinda like dead air. There really wasnt a strong malt backbone on this brew, Granted, you can taste it and all, but there's no structure at the end. Just my thought on it.

4.33,3.1,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Poured an amber honey color with a fantastic white head. The head disappears slowly into a lump in the middle of the beer and lining the edge of the glass. The smell has a sweet citrusy note to it that does a fair job of masking the alcohol. The taste is ultra-smooth. Notes of raisins, plums, caramel, citrus - but very light on the tongue. Leaves a bit of dryness that succors you into taking that next sip. Bit of additional sweetness as it warms, along with ginger and cinnamon. Very tasty, glad I waited this long before popping the cork. Deceptively tasty, this beer could have me plastered if I wasn't too careful. This beer is my celebratory beer - it shouldn't be too long before I can buy Maudite in my own state, as opposed to driving to Tennessee for it!","jlervine","Feb 05, 2004"

The beer was hazy and nectar-like, with particulates. The color was a gradient of red to orange, starting with red at the bottom moving to orangish near the top, when a small lamp shines from above. The nose was subtle yet complex, with strong notes of yeast and banana, and subtler whisps of alcohol, coriander, orange peel, and vanilla. The beer felt full and fluffy, with flavors of chewy fresh bread and honey malt, and notes of coriander and peppercorns, finishing with a satisfying and well-balanced bitterness. A very satisfying set of flavors and aromatics. I really enjoyed the 12 oz serving, but I could certainly have had another glass, as it wasn't overly sweet.

My buddies and I didnt really agree on the taste but I felt that strong flavors of cherries and other bittersweet fruit flavors were most dominant. Other strong flavors include figs as well as a general bitterness which makes the flavor all that much harder to describe. Extremely complex. Mouthfeel is chewy, full, and assertive.

Pours a cidery amber similar to Ressurrection Ale. Hints of cloves and maybe a little plum are evident in the smell. Taste is excellent with a rich fulfilling mouthfeel. One thing I did not like about this beer was that while it was balanced while cold, surprisingly it became slightly unbalanced as it warmed up, as is usually the opposite with more Belgian style beers.

The nose displays crisp, fresh-cut apples and soft, sweet vanilla with a delicate backing of spicy/peppery yeast characteristics. It's just a touch creamy and very smooth across the palate with a very-fine and gently effervescent carbonation accentuating its medium body. The flavor exhibits some fruity toffee and lightly candyish/slightly toasty malt; and it finishes a bit honeyish. The alcohol rises a bit at mid-swallow, and it finishes short and dry.

I also nosed a peppery aroma. This beer tasted very complex, beginning with a fragrant, fruity taste, and ending with a peppery finish.

The head stood around for a little while, but died out to a laceing, due to the carbonation. That was the only reason the apperance didn't get a 5 in my book.

Aroma is complex, sweet and toasted malt, cirtus tones, bitter orange peel, some coriander, hint of pepper, even some bubble gum. Flavour hits you like a velvet canoe paddle, nothing subtle about it. Malt is quickly over-run by the spiciness, yet different flavours roll onto the tongue, wave upon wave, a little too quickly to pick them all out seperately. Finishes with pepper however.

There was a definite peppery spice that gave this beer a little kick. I picked up on some caramel malts and also a woody flavor.

4.35,3.6,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"With a moderate length finish and a slightly oily mouthfeel, this beer gave no sense of the alcohol. I've had 330 ml bottles in a bar and I had a 750 bottle aged for about a year or so, and the former is much better than the latter. With age it mellowed without anything new emerging, and this beer is much better when it punchy.","nomad","Jun 02, 2003"

When I went for my first whiff if aroma all I heard was the head fizzing in my ears. There is a malt aroma thats accompanied with hints of citrus and yeast. The taste is smooth. It started with and is mostly malt with a smooth sweet finish. This is a very drinkable brew BUT watch out for the 8.0%!","Stubbie1","Jun 01, 2003"

4.47,6.4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"This beer poured into the glass an amber/orange color that was cloudy but not overly cloudy as I could see plenty of carbonation bubbles trying to escape the glass. It produced a light beige colored head that was thick, rich, sticky and long lasting. Decent lace was produced from top to bottom. The aromas that came from the glass were of big fruits (oranges, pears and apples), deep malt, caramel, bread, pine nuts, alcohol (slight) and spices. The flavors that danced across my tongue were of fruits (oranges, light pears, and apples), roasted malts, sweet malts, hops ( pine and floral in nature) slight alcohol, bread, and spices. As far as aftertaste, I noticed that when first poured (cold) a dry hop taste was present, but as it warmed, it changed to a sweet malty  with a slight alcohol  taste. This is a creamy, sweet and chewy beer. Easy to drink and very flavorful. This beer seemed different then the others, seemed to be more simple in nature, not overly complex, but I enjoyed it just as much as the others I have had from this brewery. 2 thumbs up.","Jarod","May 12, 2003"

My first tasting was at the very beginning of my discovery of craft beers, and since then I?ve sampled Maudite 3 other times, tonight being the 3rd time. Each time I?ve tasted this wonderful beer I?ve enjoyed it more. This wonderful ale pours a hazy deep orange/amber with a decent head and reasonably good retention. The smell is yeasty yet buttery with hints of fruit and spice. The taste is also wonderfully spicy and fruity with hints of yeast and just a touch of alcohol. Maudite exhibits a near perfect combination of flavors. The mild carbonation and medium body combined with the tremendous flavor and aroma make this an extremely enjoyable drink. You get no sense of the 8%ABV. This is a truly amazing beer and I?m glad I gave it a several more chances.","BittRnessabounds","Apr 30, 2003"

It pours a dark orange/brown color topped off with a huge fluffy, white froth that settles down leaving a bubbly 1/4-inch head. There is a nice burnt aroma that escapes from the glass with some sweet plum scents intermixed. The taste is extremely complex, there are so many flavors going on. The first taste was of charred wood, followed by the richness of malt and sweet caramel, finished off with an ever so slight spiciness of clove. This a good, solid medium-bodied beer. The only thing that lowers the drinkability rating a bit, is the high alcohol content, I cant have more than 2 or 3 in one setting.","Scooter77","Apr 07, 2003"

Oh yeah...it smells absolutly amazing, I just loved the sweet spicyness, lets see, theres some fruity sweets of orange peels, some nutmeg, ginger, clove, belgian-like yeast, and heck through in some roasted peppers. Then the taste is super rich and creamy smooth with lots of spicy action and tingly sweetness with a great roasty caramel malt backing thats very bold and smooth. The spice is peppery and fruity. Its got alot of things happening in the taste and feel, its just great to sip and ponder what the hecks all in this thing. The feel is medium heavy bodied, solid, silky smooth and a little bit creamy, that starts sweet, citrusy and malty then goes into the spice level and fades nicely into a fresh and drying bitter hop. Nothing here is overwhelming or overpowering, its all balanced in so softly its hard to phathom. This is one super awesome beer, highly recommend getting some.","tavernjef","Apr 04, 2003"

As for the demon and the flying canoe on the bottle, heres the story from the Unibroue website  Maudite has a typically Quebecois name that is reminiscent of the legend of the Chasse-Galerie (the legend of the Flying Canoe).

4.52,7.6,4,4.5,4.5,4,5,"Dark bronze in hue, topped by an ivory white, bumpy, well retained head that leaves spotty lace.  Sweetness in aroma is a combination of notes of honey, medium caramel malt and ripe, sugary citrusy fruitiness.  Buttery biscuit malt and mellow banana ester add additional complexity, while mild notes of powered cocoa surface as the beer breathes.  A snap of unripe citric lemony tartness yields to a deeply caramelized, yet restrained dark candi sugar sweetness.  Yeast contributions in flavor are comprised of pleasant clove phenol and understated banana esters.  Mild hop bitterness, along w/ dry biscuit malt surface mid palate and provide a delayed offsetting of the caramelized sweetness.  When the yeast is poured, this brew gains a nuttiness and mellow mustiness that adds to the overall depth in flavor.  Light to medium bodied, but once the initial high C02 level dissapates, a dextrinous mouthfeel conducive to superlative drinkability is revealed.  Finishes lightly sweet, bready w/ a hint of dry chalkiness.  Maudite is a truly unique and delicious brew.  It possesses the citric qualities of a tripel, the estery, chocolately traits of a dubbel and the rich deeply fruity notes of a dark strong.  A refined, yet robust stylistic hybrid.  I could drink this all day if my liver would allow it.","marc77","Oct 15, 2002"

On to the palate... so very many flavors appear! Spicy and fruity overall, but this, of course, requires an in-depth commentary. Black pepper tickles at the tongue first, then coriander and sweet plum come into play. Tart and dried fruit character are also found among the many flavors that run rampant on your palate. Many of the subtleties are hard to catch! Alcohol is only detectable in the warming effect. Yeast is only slightly detectable, but its presence increases as more of the 750 ml. bottle's contents are emptied into the glass. Grainy malt finish with a bit of spice. A distinct black pepper tingle is left on the tip of your tongue. Massively complex, yet medium-bodied. Almost a full-course dinner in a bottle. This is a ""damned"" (get it?) wonderful ale!

I can mainly taste ripe plum, but I am reminded of a good sweet red wine.  The best (or perhaps worst) characteristic is it is a pleasure to drink.  Again, this is an elite beer from Unibroue.

The initial aroma is yeast and bananas, with hints of Christmas spices.  My notes indicate black licorice, coriander, cider, spices, and port, with a crisp bite of hops.  Fantastic!","jackndan","Sep 26, 2002"
4.38,4.3,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Pours a dark, slightly hazy, ruby/amber color with a thick, creamy tan head that rings the glass nicely.  Sweet candy sugar and fruity aromas rule the nose which is slightly muted compared to the rest of the beer (although this may be due to my headcold.)  Huge sweet candy flavors make this brew very smooth across the tongue.  There are also some very big dark fruit presence as well.  The alcohol level is only perceived as a warming quality.  The smoothness of this brew is nicely offset but the intense carbonation that is so typical for the belgian strong ales.  The lack of any real alcohol presence and great smooth qualities make this brew excellently drinkable.  Yet another excellent brew from our neighbors to the north.  Unibroue makes some damn fine brews and that is all there is to it.","Murph","Sep 23, 2002"
4.22,0.5,4,4.5,4,4,4.5,"Pours with a champagne like fizziness.  A bubbly head dissipates rather quickly.  The beer is a murky brown/orange hue.  Spicy and yeasty nose.  (Pepper, corriander, ginger, bready and doughy.)  Nicely carbonated mouthfeel.  Drinkability is high for an 8% a/v.  Taste is similar to the aroma.  Yeasty doughiness.  Spicy zip (pepper and orange curacao).  And some bitterness attributed to the hop load, though not high.  High quality again from Unibroue.","Bighuge","Sep 11, 2002"
3.91,-6.9,4.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Hazy amber-orange color with a big, impressive head.  Yeasty, spicy nose, but not as pronounced as I expected.  Very carbonated.  Alcohol warming is present, but subtle for the 8%. Spicy and yeasty, smooth and rich belgain style beer.","Suds","Aug 31, 2002"
3.49,-16.9,5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,"341 mL bottle.  I dunno.  Maudite let me down, I was expecting something wonderful, but it was just kind of average.  The appearance, however, is really cool - the dark cloudy auburn colour and the massive head.   The taste is a little spicy, but the alcohol shone through a little too much for my taste.  Drinkable, but I woudn't go for more than one in a night.  maybe a magnum of this will taste a bit better....","the42ndtourist","Aug 27, 2002"
3.85,-8.3,4,4,4,3.5,3.5,"Deep amber / copper with a thin lace.  Very yeasty nose and flavor, with fruity esters and a pretty fair amount of spice.  Others referred to black pepper, and I would probably agree.  Very high carbonation, almost like a dry champagne.  Medium bodied, and quite strong.","zerk","Aug 21, 2002"

4.5,7.1,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Amazing beer, pours almost like a champagne. A brilliant amber colored beer with bubbly head. A beer that is not for the faint hearted at 8% definitely not a session beer but more of a sipping beer.","Reverand","Jul 14, 2002"
4.5,7.1,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Pours a dark, opaque amber color.  Aroma is slightly malty with the overtones of yeast, but the yeastiness isn't overdone in this particular brew. Complex flavor, some fruitiness that turns to a pepper flavor on the back of the tongue.  Easy to drink and definitely leaves you wanting another. One of my favorite beers from Unibroue.","LarryV","Jul 14, 2002"
4.23,0.7,4.5,4,4.5,4,4,"It's been a great adventure in Unibroue land, but all good things must come to an end.  But now I know which one's to grab when they are staring at me from the shelf.","BeerAngel","Jul 13, 2002"
4.15,-1.2,4,4,4,4.5,4.5,"Strong bold yeast alcohol nose.  Pink champagne looking with wisps of white lace on the surface of the brew.  Slightly fruity tasting with a big yeast tongue.  Slightly sweet malt base with layers of soft flavor.  Very soft on the mouth.  This should be the introductory unibroue product for newbies, because it is soft and easy drinking in every way.  It is not as bold as their other products, but it does stand on its own as a smooth, uncommon, wonderful treat.","frank4sail","Jul 02, 2002"

But was pleased after I did, very strong alcohol aroma, nice dark appearance and it kicks.  I would recommend this beer to belgian lovers ouot there I think you would enjoy...........CHEERS","tigerpaws","Jun 25, 2002"
4.31,2.6,5,4,4.5,4.5,4,"A darker color, color is like the paint ""Burnt Umber""...upcharging bubbles contribute to a head thats big at first but then mostly sticks to the side of the wine goblet's edges. Muted somewhat fruity aroma cut with some allspice. Mouth-coating impact, spicy like a pumpkin pie in flavor. Carbonation persists to finish, muting a slightly alcoholic presence and adding a nice touch to the mixed citrus/apple alternative taste. One of my favorites in this style, not excessively wine-like but with good complexity. The color of this brew is unique and the flavor is complex but balanced. A beer of distinction, worth sharing the uncorking with some buddies on special occassions. A perfect ""first"" beer before switching to some Porters and Stouts.","ADR","Apr 29, 2002"
4.05,-3.6,4,4,4,4.5,4,"Looks like apple cider -- cloudy, copper color, with a nice, full head. Mildly fruity aroma of apple and spice. Taste is not as full as I expected at first, probably because I needed to let it warm up a bit. Once warmed, there was a perfect balance of sweet malt and fruity tang, with a rather powerful spicy finish (pepper, coriander, and clove). Nicely carbonated as well. I liked this beer during the first glass, but truly appreciated it during the second. Unibroue is awesome.","mophie","Apr 16, 2002"
4.5,7.1,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"This is a truly exceptional beer. It has a nice malt flavor, but the spicy and sweet undertones really set it apart. From the first sip, I was hooked on this one. Fortunately my corner store always has it in stock. However, after drinking this on a fairly regular basis since my original review, I'm lowering my review on taste and mouthfeel jsut a bit.","mickeymac","Apr 09, 2002"
4.3,2.4,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Maudite pours a nice, cloudy, dark copper color. The big creamy head, which I almost misseddwindles to nill. A faint fuity aroma on the nose, and on the palate a little zestiness as well. Medium body w/ light carbonation. The finish is that of zestiness and a bit of warming action going on. Overall a good la bière!","WilliamPhilaPa","Apr 04, 2002"
3.85,-8.3,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"i like it a lot, very smooth, not to cloying and sweet and good malt profile, a very very decent beer.","rastaman","Apr 03, 2002"
4.14,-1.4,4,5,4,4,3.5,"The color is nice. Medium dark reddish brown and cloudy. The head is a bit foamy and dissapates quickly. It has a mild pleasant smell. The flavor lacks some of the complexity that I would expect from a Belgian style brew, but the more I drank, the more I liked it. The alcohol only leaves the slightest footprint on the tongue -- just enough to let you know it's there. Overall, a good beer.","aracauna","Apr 01, 2002"

I got a lot of the spiciness, and it was very pretty looking, but I didn't taste any fruit, and the spice was overwhelming.  Although I might have just had a bad bottle...I'll try again sometime.","bk3nj","Feb 01, 2002"
