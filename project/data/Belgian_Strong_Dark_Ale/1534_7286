The mouthfeel is medium to light, with a bit of alcohol burn, very little carbonation.  It seems like there's a lot of different flavors in this beer, but they aren't melded well.

4.3,9.1,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"750 ml bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 8/6/2012. Pours lightly cloudy very dark reddish brown color with a 2 finger dense khaki head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with moderate streaming carbonation. Aromas of big raisin, cherry, plum, prune, fig, licorice, molasses, toast, candi sugar, brown bread, herbal, light clove, and yeast earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great complexity and balance of dark malt/candi sugar and fruity yeast ester notes; with good strength. Taste of big raisin, plum, prune, cherry, fig, licorice, molasses, candi sugar, toast, herbal, light pepper, clove, and yeast earthiness. Lingering notes of raisin, plum, prune, fig, cherry, licorice, molasses, toast, candi sugar, pepper, light clove, herbal, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible balance and complexity of dark malt/candi sugar and fruity/spicy yeast ester flavors; with a great malt/yeast balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a moderately slick, smooth, and slightly syrupy mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is an outstanding Belgian strong dark ale. All around awesome complexity and balance of dark candi sugar malt and fruity/spicy yeast ester flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the big ABV. A highly enjoyable offering.","superspak","Feb 05, 2014"

4.2,6.6,3.25,4.5,4.25,3.75,4.25,"Mild dusting of a head across the surface, dark tan brown, swiftly pulls back to the glass sides, the lacing streaks are quite thin but have some stick to them. Murky dark brown colored liquid with more of a yellow tint than anything else, not a lot of visible effervescence, nothing truly remarkable about how it looks. The nose offers licorice, cola, orange spice, lightly roasted chocolate, fig, date, banana and hint of green apple, pleasing for how it does not overdo the sweetness and stays openly knit and airy, finishes with lingering nutmeg, cinnamon and splash of witch hazel. Medium-bodied, for its relative sweetness and mouth grip it has decent fluidity. Carbonation is light but generally up to the task. Initially tastes like a root beer float. Vanilla, malted milk balls, ginger, licorice, orange citrus, Brazil nuts and butterscotch predominate. The fruit has a darker complexion here with prune and cherry trumping the date and fig, not really showing a lot of esters nor breadiness. Likewise, no boozy “heat” on display although you can feel it once a good portion of the bottle is gone. Gains peppery bite as it warms. Fashions a dry, punctuated finish which helps it marshal an argument for being a good food beer and not just an after dinner sipper.","farrago","Dec 17, 2013"

Medium bodied and well carbonated. This beer is full of flavor that masks the 10% alcohol well. Extremely well balanced. The taste is dark malt, with chocolate undertones, blended with spice and licorice with a very slight alcohol finish. Finishes clean with a burst of dark malt against spice and alcohol. An excellent Christmas Ale. I just did a side by side against St. Bernardus Christmas ale, on 12/4/13. Gouden is far superior in terms of body, complexity and flavor.","tillmac62","Nov 19, 2013"

The head begins to recede, but never really dissapears. The lacing is exquisite. It holds for a second or two and then forms rivers and trubutaries through itself that all eventually lead to the sea of delectable belgian ale that lies below. The aroma carries warming notes of anise, dark fruit, yeast, and alcohol. The palate is very much like a nice glass of cabernet. It is a bit tart up front but then it rounds off nicely with rich notes of bread and anise. The anise carries over into the finish and joins yeast in a wonderful union of flavor. The carbonation is a little heavy, but its full mouthfeel counteracts it. It leaves a slight tackiness on the lips from it higher than average gravity. I usually frown upon this and I think that it is the downfall of many winter brew's, but somehow this beer makes it work. This beer forced a smile across my face from sheer joy.","silverking","Jan 09, 2013"

Pours a dull mahogany hue with a consistent, 1.5 inch, light tan head the sizzles and pops as it slowly recedes into a clumpy quarter inch cap. Nose suggests dark fruit, anise and orange Aspergum. Tastes pretty much like it smells - no real surprises here. There's also a slightly oxidized quality that comes out towards the finish. Mouthfeel is light-medium (but closer to light) with an even carbonation that falls just shy of being lively. There's also just a kiss of residual heat that lingers between quaffs as well as a slight acidity. Overall, not a bad example of the style, but not my favorite from this brewer. Not sure what a little age might do to this, but it might be worth laying down a bottle for a year or two.","Jwale73","Jan 08, 2013"

The sour fruit flavor has attenuated and blended in the the dark fruits and dark malts. Nicely integrated now. Full bodied and creamy, complex and a delight to drink.

Strong notes of anise with notes of prune and fig lead with notes of brown sugar and light molasses. Taste leads with initial bite of spice from the anise, sweetness expected from the nose isn't as pronounced and gives a light pastry like quality - pizzelle cookies come to mind and peg the season perfectly. Rum soaked prune and fig on the back end and settles into a pleasant, lightly sweet brown sugar note. Medium bodied, could use a touch more heft to stand up to the bold flavors. Overall, pegs the season perfectly and quite unique with its flavor profile - only a few minor concerns with body and ability to drink more than 10oz or so.","rfgetz","Jan 23, 2012"

Huge malt backbone, w/ just the right amount of fruit, yeast, and spices. All melded into a giant cyclone of Christmas cheer. The only thing I can ding it on is that I'd like to have it be a little less sweet. Otherwise it's where the smell score is. Feel is decadent. Amazingly complex, smooth, silky w/ a bite at the end.

Smelled of big spiciness, sour plums, candied pears, and a hint of alcohol presence. The taste confirmed the candied pear presence first and foremost, along with sour plum and black cherry, and then finished on a sweet note, with the alcohol well-hidden throughout, or at least much moreso than in the nose. Smooth and of medium thickness; very little carbonation.

Mild hops let the sweetness linger in the finish as the heat subtly glides in. Dry and mostly clean with a bit of sweet port. Feel is almost quad like in its richness but not quite.

Very spicy, sweet aroma, with hints of caramel and cinamon. I'm getting lots of caramel in the flavour, which is very malt-forward. Lots of dark fruit too, with cheeries, raisins, aniseed, chocolate and spice. There's a lot going on here, and I don't think I'm quite nailing it.

Banana, clove, and peach are prominent. By the time the beer warms a little, though, the aroma is full-on licorice. The licorice flavor is intense and penetrating. Wonderful range of smells! The flavor is also interesting, although it tends to be a little too sugary for my tastes. Malt is the foremost taste. Lots of residual sugars (you can taste them on the lips). There's a little yeast, and a little alcohol. Nice warming...nearly tongue numbing by the end of the bottle. The beer is medium in body, and lower in carbonation than it could have been.

Smooth and creamy mouth feel off of a full body. Beefy, with a juicy caramel malt splash up front. An alcoholic bite thrashes the taste buds. Spicy, with suggestions of white pepper. The fruity, alcoholic esters drop a tropical bomb. Kiwi, pineapple and papaya come to mind. This has hot fermentation written all over it.

Smell is of anise, all-spice, cinnamon, ginger, and citrus peel along with some spiciness from the yeast, some dark, brown-sugary malts, and a touch of alcohol. The licorice/cinnamon thing reminds me of biscochitos which would be very apropros for a holiday beer. Taste is overwhelmed by anise and fennel seed flavors with the other spices regulated to the background. Malt sweetness is prevalent though.

Cherry-blood bronze with a smooth and creamy dust-khaki foam cap. Aromas of overripe banana, nutmeg, clove, powdered ginger, cinnamon, farmyardy yeast funk, lemon zest and a finishing scent of earthy grain husks. Tart applesauce and raisin puree flavor mixed with mashed banana and a funky vegetal spiciness in the aftertaste -- sort of like brussels sprouts. Lingering ""country"" yeast flavors. Noticeable alcohol buzz all around the flavor and mouthfeel, but nothing that's too distracting from the overall taste experience. Surprisingly light in body for such a big, flavorful beer. Moderate alcohol slickness is barely perceptible, leading to extremely easy drinkability, especially given the big flavor and high alcohol content.

Aroma: Deep plum spiced nutmeg and other chirstmas spices infused with warming alcohol fruit notes of raisins and apples, nice. Taste: Strong sweetness layers of spice, fruit, and alcohol complexities. Not quite as solid as it has been in the bottle, but damn good nonetheless one of the best Belgian Christmas offerings.

3.43,-12.9,4,3.5,3,3.5,4,"750 mL cork-n-cage bottle that could be a year or two old as the label has some wear. Served in a Chimay chalice on Christmas eve. Pours a deep garnet with a 1 finger tan head that reduces to a quarter inch of creamy foam. Smells of holiday spices and some malts. The most prominent flavors are cinnamon and anise, but they're followed with spiciness, yeast, ginger?, clove?, and alcohol. Good spices, but not enough beer flavor. The body is medium to thick and it's easy enough to drink for the 10% beer it is, but I was expecting something more from my first winter Belgian.","mmmbeer","Dec 26, 2005"

The head retention is quite good and it leaves some very nice lace as well. The nose is rich and exciting but not overtly bold, revealing more and more of itself with each sniff. Cola (cardamom) is evident upfront, backed by a note of sweet black licorice (from star anise) and some prune-like fruit. Nutmeg and cinnamon creep in along with some tropical fruit, the suggestion of caramel and cocoa, and a splash of thin alcohol. It's lightly tingly across the tongue with an exceptionally fine, median carbonation and a medium light body. In the flavor, fruit is initially suggested with a combination of berries, cherries, pluums, and tropical notes that quickly become drenched in cola syrup. Chocolatey notes approach but hesitate to actually make an entrance; and sweet anise becomes dominant at the swallow. Alcohol skirts around the edges as well, always present but without ever really making itself known. It finishes dry but with the suggestion of sweetness, similar to molasses; and with a light dusting of ginger and peppery spiciness. Quite remarkable! As complex as it is, it's actually very focused. An impressively spiced holiday ale that deserves a place at the dinner table: working equally well as an apertif, mid-meal accompanyment with a wide variety of dishes, balancing dessert beer, after-dinner drink or night-cap.

3.96,0.5,4.5,3.5,4,4.5,4,"It takes me a lot of examination to figure out the procession of tastes in this one, mostly because the licorice/anise wallop covers up some of the secondary tastes. The first stage is well-rounded, and when I look beyond the blast of licorice I see that this comes from the overtones of bitter caramel and syrupy fruitiness. The second stage is highly carbonated and laden with anise. The finish is extremely dry and tingly, with a smoldering finish way on the back of my tongue. Again, there's some molasses in there, but it's almost smoky in its texture. It's also tangy but not overly sugary or cloying; it reminds me of bitter apricots. The bottle says that it ages well, and given the tastes I just experienced I'll bet that's true.

This beer finishes with a definite alcoholic bite, though it is not overbearing and goes well with the spice notes. Lightly sweet with raisin and other dark fruit notes are in the fore front of this beer. There is no real bitterness, the spices and alcohol counter-point the sweetness and fruity flavors.

But that takes a backseat in no time at all as the waves of candy, fruit and malt take over. But then the alcohol comes back and stays for the duration. Signs of wood and yeast come and go as well. But the alcohol taste is the mainstay, and for that reason, I dock the drinkability and give it an avg. rating in that department. The lingering bitter alcohol taste is not pleasurable.

Chocolate laced sweetness upfront in flavor leads into a malt profile comprised of biscuit and butter contrasted by a light fruity melange of woody maple syrup and dried date notes. Sweetness takes on a molasses note mid palate and couples with the subtle ripe banana esters to lend a brown sugar sprinkled banana split impression. Hop bitterness struggles to assert itself, but soundly loses to resounding, yet judicious malt sweetness. Medium bodied and superbly smooth in mouthfeel. Finishes w/ a fading light caramel and bittersweet chocolate combination. Carolus Noel is a delicious brew. Its rich, yet simple malt character, stately fruitiness and well controlled residual sweetness lend it superlative drinkability.

Excellent brew! It could definitely be cellared for a while. My mom bought this bottle for me for Christmas. It's very much appreciated and enjoyed!","hyuga","Jan 03, 2003"
4.7,19.3,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,"Murky brown color, like the Ohio River in the spring. Head thicker and more dense than your average Denny's Nightime Dishwasher. (Sorry..that was uncalled for.) Smell was super smooth and rich. Full of fruits, and traditional Christmas spices. First taste was a rich combination and ample amounts of plums, figs, earthy fruits and a bottle and a half of cinnamon. Taste stayed creamy and rich. Sediment swirl yeiled anouther explosion of smells.Christmas in a bottle about sums it up. Alcohol sneeks by at 10.5%, but at one point was just shy of Cherry Nyquil. I guess you could say, slightly medicinal. Not a bad thing at all, IMO. This bottle got better and more flavorful as the night went on. Took me about 2.5 hours to drink, and savor. Medium bodied, perfectly carbonated, and super smooth. A Christmas beer to enjoy. Cheers to all the ba's who tried this before.","StevieW","Dec 30, 2002"
4.3,9.1,4.5,4.5,4,3.5,5,"Beautiful clear dark mahogany color with a 1/4"" brownish head that sinks to a thick, creamy film that has a nice lacing effect on the glass. Huge sweet maltiness with big dark candy sugar aspects in the nose. Some very nice, and nicely subtle, fruity and spicy qualities. Getting some light nutmeg and cinnamon along with some nice fig and raisin aromas. Big sweet candy maltiness all over the tongue right off the bat. Lightly spiced fruits in the background. Some nice cinnamon, nutmeg, and peppery spices with some tasty raisins and light baked apple dumpling characteristics. Slightly thin body through the middle of the brew before finishing with a nice malty sweet flourish that is accompanied by a nice warming alcohol quality. Warm and tasty but a little thin in the middle that drops the mouthfeel a bit. An excellent brew with good warming qualities for the cold Holiday season. The slightly lighter aspects of the brew lend to an even better drinkability. I could both drink several of these and would definitely be willing to get a few more at a later date. An excellent brew and worthy of a purchase if you see it. A big thanks to Bill at the Alexandria Whole Foods for letting me sample this one and enticing me to buy it.","Murph","Dec 25, 2002"
4.4,11.7,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,"Wow, a really nice holiday treat. Deep brown-ruby-ginger in color, with an inviting tan head that fades to wispy laces across the surface. How to describe the smell? Anise definitely comes to mind, and mince meat pie. There's a fresh loaf of cinnamon bread baking in the background as well. There's anise in the taste (or maybe horehound?), definitely caramel-sweet, with a spicy, peppery alcohol finish. Nice. Keeps you warm and toasty, and is worthy of sharing with close friends in front of the fire.","mophie","Dec 23, 2002"
4.32,9.6,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Big hazy ginger brown with a large bottle-conditioned tan head (in a Duvel glass)...laces are thick rings with underhanging tracks. Very fruity aroma, lots of cling peaches and syrup and definite ginger impressions. Wow, smooth as a molasses cookie with a mulled pear cider, counterpointed by a crisp but non-assertive hopping. Aftertaste is just slightly vinous with continuing fresh fruit and ginger. This puppy is a fine holiday brew, a little on the hepped-up alcohol but nice light-medium body, lower carbonation, and fresh flavors.","ADR","Dec 13, 2002"
3.92,-0.5,4,4.5,4,3,3.5,"Aftertaste & mouthfeel: Fruity flavour keeps fruit-acids as characteristic. palate is rather thinnish, but with a throat-warming alcohol effect.","JorisP","Dec 10, 2002"
4.07,3.3,4,4.5,4,3.5,4,"On the pour, the beer appears to be a somewhat caliginous cherry red color, the head Bunyanesque in size, the texture creamy, with sticky sheets of lace to caress the glass. Nose is fruit sweet, over ripe apples and or banana comes to mind, malt tones and light caramel hints also present a treat for the old honker to sniff. The start is honey sweet, the top lean, the finish is pleasantly acidic, cheerfully hopped, dry and somewhat alcohol bitter aftertaste. Yes, it does Warm the Tummy, and should definitely be put in the Winter Warmer category. If you like strong high ABV beer this is a must try, but you may find it a bit pricey at $10.49 a 750ml bottle. Personally I dont mind the price, because Im Worth It Baby!","Gusler","Nov 24, 2002"
