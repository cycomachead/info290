"750mL bottle served in a Belgian tulip glass.  Beer pours chestnut brown in color with an ample head.  Classic, yeasty aroma.  Flavor is traditional BSDA: rich, yeasty, Belgian.  It's rich but not complex.  Dark, but there's no depth of grain flavor.  Dry in the finish, hoppy even.  Very drinkable, and perhaps a great introduction to the style for novice advocates of high-octane beer.  A solidly mediocre offering of a style with great potential."
""
"Rich dark copper with Amber hues, light creamy head.  Smells of hops and spice and everything nice.  Lightly carbonated and very smooth you can taste the high Alcohol in the finish."
""

"The guy below me must be delusional. This is a solid american made abbey style ale. The only copper I got was from the beautiful hue of the beer. North Coast makes some really solid brews and I'm not sure what took me so long to finally try this one. Mild spice and dark fruits come through nicely as it warms. I really enjoyed this one."
"If you want to drink liquid copper; be my guest. The only thing Belgian Style about this beer may be the yeast......it's garbage!"
""
""
"Lovely chunky mess of a head that sticks around for a bit, dark and warm, boozy smell with a bit of spice. Less complex taste than one would expect, and underwhelming mouthfeel, but a decent yank quad (or dub?). Had this in 12 oz 4 pack. Big bottle might be a bit much with only 1 or 2."
""
""
""
""
"Ill just say this. Really awesome and complex beer. Really tasty, really fruity, really malty. Raisins, sugar, hops, grapes!! Beer Advocate people, this is an awesome beer!!!"
""
"Says review is optional. It is not"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Not bad, not bad at all.  Seems a little weak in smell, scents don't stick out as much as some others; taste is a little flat, very little depth.  Still, for the price, it's a good buy."
"Bottle of brother thelonious  drank."
""
""
""
"No head or what was one dissipates really quick pours dark brown has a pretty fizzy taste once hitting your mouth but the tail end is where its at not as sweet as some other american quads i tasted which is a good thing for me. i like the boozy taste where you can breath it in. Def not a bad buy for a 25oz was $7.89 at bevmo. If youre into quads like me this is just another to try and knock off the check list"

"Has a wine-like quality, I'm very disappointed"
"a great representation of a belgian"
""
"- overall a very standard strong dark ale, good beer but not a lot stands out as individualistic"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Deep, dark red-brown pour with off-white head that quickly disappears. Aroma of sweet fruits and malt, translate well into the flavor with some alcohol, and as some have mentioned - a bit of red wine, especially on the finish which is dry. Tasty stuff."
""
""
""
""
"O- It's alright; I like BSDAs to have more of a roasted malt, smooth flavour that isn't as sticky or yeasty as this one is."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"It actually tastes really good, it just has a slight off smell, is a bit chewy, and the head runs off pretty quickly. I liked it tho"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A meal all by itself. Prevalent molasses notes. Great conversation ale, especially with the right musical setting."
""
""
""
"Deep brown muddy color. Very low light brown head the fizzled with at soapy rainbow effect and disappeared. Heavy chocolate and boozy aroma with a whole lot of steel smell. Taste is again quite chocolatey with thick booze undertones. Dark earthiness of wet oak and cedar. Just the right amount of hops finishes the big sweet chocolate and heavy booziness. The finish is truly top notch. It's a nice well made beer."
"Honey brown pour with a pale, airy head.  Thin feel with plenty carbonation and strong alcohol finish.  More metallic than fruity, but malty and semi-sweet.  Overall an easy-drinking copper brew.  Highly enjoyable."
""
""
""
""
""
"Drank 1.22.15 at Giant eagle from the singles vault.Alcohol not covered up well but assuming it's a strong ale I can let it slide. Bottle shape is unique in a sense, shorter and wider. Smell isn't offputting, but it's not spectacular either. Bitterness is subtle, and I am tasting a good amount of malt throughout. Lacks carbonation but I see that as a good thing."
""
"Beautiful appearance and great smell of yeast, bread, malt sweetness. Warming beer alcohol-wise, excellent for pairing with foods like steak, mushrooms and potatoes or good bread.  Other reviewers mentioned it is a bit thin or as having a one note of sweetness, and I get that too especially cold. Some better Belgian brewed examples of the style are available but I do like this one along with those. This does warm up nicely imho overcoming some of the one note sweetness with vanilla, figs and caramel  scents."
""
""
""
"O - Had a couple bombers of this several years ago, and just getting back around to it. Seems like revisiting past likes is harder these days with all the new releases and new brewers. One of my favorites in this style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Beautiful ruby red pour. Small big bubble head. Semi sweet bread yeast aroma. Very tasty. Tastes like a real Belgian beer. I usually get this fake taste in American Belgian style beers, but this one tastes authentic. Sweet thick, but not that sticky, malty taste. Similar to a caramel banana dessert. Mild fruit raisin taste. Really enjoy it."
""
"Awesome dark Belgium.  Definitely need to try."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I loved everything about this beer"
"Its a good beer when nothing else is available"
""
""
""
""
""
"Sure, the booze was here but the whole bottle had to be polished off before I could feel it. While a Belgian-style beer at heart, there was so much missing from this that should have been present from the get-go. I would have called this ""The Loneliest Monk"" as this was not quite like other Belgian Strong Dark Ales that I've had, and not in a good way. Easily the weakest offering from North Coast and only worth a go for fans of the brewery or of dark beers that handle light - this one hit too many wrong notes to be rated higher in my book."

"Absolutely delicious. Lead my to brew a Dark Belgian for the first time"
""
"Had this again after several years - was not as impressed as I was the first time. It seemed somehow thin, with a trace of the yeasty goodness and malty sweetness of a great Belgian but lacking something. It became quite one-note after awhile."

"DATE TASTED: November 6, 2014... GLASSWARE: Duvel tulip... OCCASION: Browns get their one prime-timer tonight, so time to break out the bomber in celebration... APPEARANCE: effervescent off-white bubbles light up an otherwise dark-as-ebony-keys  body; two-finger brown head is sudsy and substantial... AROMA: heavy plum and apple early; approximates a red wine with some astringent, brackish notes... PALATE: wow--full-bodied, raking the tongue with a dry finish that demands another sip; warming and hearty; thick and creamy....TASTE: plum indeed, and secondary fruits include apple, pear and lack currants--big and flavorful; stoutish at its finish... OVERALL: a BIG beer that warmly mellows--not as complex as Monk's music, but no argument that it pleases as ""Straight No Chaser"" might on an autumn night..."

"Overall: A good attempt at the style, but lacks the well rounded character of the best examples. Booze and slight roastiness compete with (rather than compliment) the fruity esters."
""
""
"Terrifically smooth malt taste with bitter and alcohol taste at the end."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Fruity. I tasted plums and fig and maybe other dark fruits. I thought I was drinking a quadrupel. Very good flavor. As for look and smell and color I couldnt care less. Its all about taste."
""
"I am a BIG fan of Thelonious' music and the beer is just smooth.  It has a warm brown color and a deep malty flavor.  It leaves you with bit of a bitter aftertaste kind of like the last note of a Monk tune."

"The beer pours a tan fluffy and foamy head that dissipates quickly. The beer itself is an opaque ruby red with brown notes. The beer smell is a bit sweet and dark fruity. The notes include plum and raisin. The taste is very similar to the nose with the same dark fruit taste. However, the taste also has a slightly sour note as well. The malt notes also come out in a caramel form that gives it a bit of sweetness with a roasted finish at the end. The mouthfeel is a bit heavy bodied and fairly smooth but feels slightly watery. Overall, an okay bee but not one I'll pick again."

"Heavier than it seems, but still has that belgium sweetness to it.  A bit bitter and very malty.  It's thick going down.  Has a nice smell and a dark color.  I imagine it to be a good beer suited for colder weather."

"This beer has a very nice color, it is pleasing to the eye. It has a Nice reddish color; it almost resembles red wine when put in the light. Brother Thelonious has an Intense nose, but a smoother flavor. Oddly enough it reminds me of Sam Adam's Boston Lager...? It definitely does not taste like a 9.4%"

"The worst part is that I didn't even mean to purchase this beer. I bought a four-pack of Three Philosophers--at least that's what the carrier packaging said. I didn't look at the actual bottles at the store, and when I got home, lo and behold I was stuck with four of these. And now I have three more of them to suffer through. I'll update this review if the boozy Brother Thelonious somehow grows on me."

"Overall, this is a good American attempt at a BSDA. The flavors are all there but it's just lacking a little something. The yeast doesn't quite compare to a good Belgian version of this style, and the finish is a little too dry. On the plus side, I'm a jazz fan and at least the money I spent on this beer is going to a good cause."
""
""
"Poured from a bottle into a pilsner. No head, crystal clear medium brown color, no lacing. Aroma is fruity floral hops, and toasted malt. Flavor is toasted malt, fruit--figs, a bit of toffee and yeast, delicious and unique! Overall this is a very good to outstanding medium brown ale. Hint--drink it closer to room temperature, not ice cold."

"O – 9.4% alcohol, and you can’t even taste it. This is one of my favorite beers. I’ve had this about five times now. It’s sweeter than most beer I like, but it is so pleasantly so… some of these strong abbey’s can have almost a syrupy sweetness that is too much. But this is the most well balanced and blended beer of this style I’ve ever had. It is sweet… it’s supposed to be, but something in the smokey malt flavors really balance it. I don’t directly taste it and find ‘hops’ but there is some element of a dry bitterness there subtly in the background. It washes so cleanly, that it makes a great sipping beer. One of the few beers I consider too good to chug."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours dark amber with a small lightly foamy head. Smell is boozy and fruity.. Can tell this is a strong ale. Cider-y. Flavor is bitey with booze but tastes sweet...almost a cane sugariness to it..definitely a dessert like barley wine. Mouthfeel is thin and boozy with some mild heat. Overall not this biggest barley wine fan..but this isn't bad."

"O: overall, rough around the edges - looks-wise - but very nice flavors, despite lacking some dynamics and dimension"
""
""
""
""

"O) A Belgian Dubbel - no doubt. Just wish the taste profile was a bit more complex."
""

"I heard about this abbey ale a few months ago while traveling in California. Unfortunately I had so much my palate during the trip I was never able to make time for a Brother Thelonious. Imagine my excitement when, soon after returning to the Ohio Valley, I spy a 4 pack sitting oh so obligingly in a local beer spot. I took her home, chilled it a bit but not too much and the rest, as they say is history. Sweet and Delicious, plus you can't beat that label. Who doesn't want to promote Jazz music? Nobody, that's who."
""
""
""
""
""

"O: Outstanding abby style ale. Very good representation of the style and helps a music that I love. Part of the proceeds go to promoting jazz organizations."

"Overall: An enjoyable Abbey style ale. A very pleasant aroma and taste of dried fruits and sugary dark malts. The alcohol warmth makes itself known but only as a positive, “floral”addition. I’d like to try this aged on fresh oak or some kind of spent spirit barrel."
"Overall: Not super complex, but still pleasant, and easy drinking. Pretty ok."
"O- Though it's nothing incredible, the drinkability would have me coming back for more as long as the price is reasonable. Unfortunately, with North Coast, that doesn't seem to be the case very often."
" Opinion: North Coast brewery was the brewery we visited when my wife and I went to Northern California last year. We enjoyed this place a lot. Not sure if it was a different batch, the brewery or just being on vacation, but I enjoyed this a lot more when I was out there. Definitely not a bad beer, but not my favorite Belgian Dark by a long shot."
""
""
""
""
""
"o - a great sipper, enjoyed it more as it warmed up."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall – A decent but nothing too exceptional Belgian strong dark ale. Worth a try, but one I wouldn’t take over most other Belgian strong darks that are readily available."
""

""

""
""
""
"O: Very flavorful dark ale with style characteristic flavors and aromas."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a deep amber with ruby highlights in color. A very thin off-white head was seen with some spotty lacing when sipped. the aroma is of sweet dried fruits, caramel and toffee. the taste actually has more going on than the aroma. Goes down pretty easy but you aren't going to have too many of these at all due to the high alcohol content. No harsh or bitter aftertaste. Perfect carbonation as well."
""
""
""
""
""

"O: Well worth a try. I love this brewery."

""
""
"O: This is a beer I remembered much more fondly from the early days of my foray into better beer. It's not doing much for me now. It feels half-baked and far too sweet in both taste and texture, even for the style. Pass."
""
""
""
""
"Pours great with a large head that has a brownish tint too it. You can taste the Alcohol coming through a bit, witch adds to the taste in my opinion. The only way I can describe the other flavors is Rich. Rich smell and Rich taste. Try it."
"Highly recommended for getting into Belgian Strongs. One I think is a bit underrated here."
""
""
""
""
""
"Brother Thelonious does not disappoint. I love Belgian style beer, and this one ranks among the best I have tried."
"Brother Thelonious is a good drinkable American brewed Belgian Strong Dark Ale. Remember, do not drink too cold as the Brother benefits from time to warm up."
"O - don't read reviews when you seek this out. Just buy a 12 oz bottle and give it a shot. It's a damn fine Belgian style ale from a classic american craft brewery. It's probably my favorite offering from North Coast and in my book is one of the best American made Belgian Strong Dark ales ever created."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Not at all what I was expecting. The beer looks and tastes like a high alcohol version of a thin English Brown Ale. The metallic smell/flavor does not add to the experience. I wanted to like this beer as I am a big fan of Thelonious Sphere Monk. Unfortunately, the beer is not as good as the musician."
""
""

"Not a bad beer , but I've had better from North Coast."

"Strong flavor, can taste the alcohol but doesn't overpower. Reminds me of a less sophisticated Piraat. Can definitely taste the Belgian abbey homage. Overall a very good, solid brew. Powerful hops with a very small hint of fruitiness. Purchased at the Craft Beer Cellar in Newton, MA."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Average all round. Not a bad beer and glad I tried it, but I wouldn't seek it out again, not very much going on and it seemed underwhelming in a lot of respects, too much sweetness and it can't cover some of the alcohol volatiles and spice. Besides those two combatants theres not much else, but there is a decent spice profile that blends subtly along, a decent afterdinner desert sipper. Easy enough to drink but not worth any extra effort, the complexity just isnt there and the balance lacks as well."

"On the sweet side, with good yeast esters and moderate complexity. Lots of raisin goodness and rummy alcohol character. The cloying character overwhelms. Not as complex as some."

"The Brother Thelonious is an outstanding Belgian Style Abbey Ale. It pours a dark brown and amber with a nice creamy head. The aroma is a dense, spicy dark fruit that give you a hint of what your tastebuds are in for. The taste is a very deep and intense spiceness that exudes the Belgian yeast flavors with a sweet caramel and molasses. Brother Thelonious is very complex from the banana and bubble gum flavors of the Belgian yeast to the spicier and sweet dark fruit. I really enjoyed this beer and for an American version of a Belgian Abbey Style Ale it is fantastic. It is thick and complex and gives you a lot to chew on."

"Decent. A good beer, but there are plenty of better options on the shelves. Certainly not worth the price point."
""
""
""
""
"Overall- Nothing amazing and the presence really mellows as it opens up. I rather like that. Pretty dry for a BDSA and it works. Definitely worth a try but it won't dethrone the greats in this style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Definitely not a Belgian strong ale. Absent are the strong yeasty malty flavors and it lacks the sweetness. Color was very dark. Not especially full bodied. Somewhat thin mouth feel. It was drinkable after it warmed up bit. I will try something else next time."
"Medium bodied. Effervescence is bold at start but subsides quickly. Warming from the first inhalation. A hint of drying finishes it off. Smooth except for the initial effervescence burst."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall 3.50: A good beer on its own, but as a representative of an ""Abbey Ale"" or a ""Belgain Strong Dark," it is laughable. Interesting to me that this beer just happens to use one the same hops and (probably) some of the same grains as the brewery's flagship ""Rasputin."" Guess they didn't start back at ""zero"" to brew this baby. Ultimately, I think the imbiber should just ignore the supposed ""Belgian"" relation (which is impossible) and drink this beer for what it tastes like, not for what it claims to be."

"Wow. I don't normally drink this style of beer. It is pricy at $5 for a bottle at retail, but worth it. An amazing aroma and mouthfeel. A full, rich head and a beautiful clear bronze color. Great balance. Definitely much better than the BA rating of 85."
""
""
""
""
""
"I wish I could remember how much I pad for this beer, because that definitely factors into the rating. I think it smells great. Definitely has that wonderful aroma of strong dark ale. The flavor is nice and it as nice mouth feel. There could be a bikt more casrbonation. My bottle seemed a bit flat. I liked it, but if the price is the same as the SDAs from Unibrue I would buy line of those instead."
""
""
""
"Had to try as I like Belgian style ale and Thelonious Monk is an American Original jazz composer. I wasn't disappointed as the first taste hit the back of my mouth. Very easy to drink, goes well with curries. Really as good as some Belgians. I would get this again."
"overall. a good beer that fans of dark ales will enjoy but will be appreciated by people with milder taste as well. still lacks wow, the brewery has better."
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Probably not something I'd seek out again but would have no problem drinking again. DIdn't really get any outstanding characteristics from it and it was personally a bit sweeter than what I'd like out of this style of beer. In short, worth a try if you can, it seems like the opinion on this beer forks pretty heavily between reviewers."

"Very dark and very full bodied. Quite foamy on the open but settled down after a few minutes. Initial taste was somewhat over the top and sweet, expected from a darker beer. The flavor mellowed and balanced and became much more enjoyable. Not my favorite darker beer, but would like to try again."
"MF – Med to full bodied, smooth, creamy, warming."

"A pronounced and bold flavor that has hints of caramel, figs, and toffee with a large alcohol bite. To me this beer has layers of flavor and each sip seems to reveal another depth to the beer. I wouldn't just put this above all other Belgian style beers, but all beers period. This is not a mellow beer by any means, it is a reach out and grab you by the jugular beverage."
""
""
""
""
"Bit of a let down here. There are far better dubbels out there, and this one - despite the fantastic label and great cause - just wasn't the ticket. Oversweet, boozy, and lacking in the complexity I can find elsewhere."
""

""
""
""
""

"O: Not sure how well it meets the style, but I enjoyed it quite a bit. I was surprised but pleased with the restrained sourness/sweetness, and that smokey finish was very unexpected, but again, pleasant. Another victory for North Coast."

"O - I was expecting something less than stellar based on the reviews, but I have to say, I came away very impressed. It may not look or smell like it's about to rock your world, but give it a taste with an open mind. This was better, for me, than the Allagash Dubbel I had two days ago, and I was expecting the exact opposite result."

"Loved this from the look of the bottle so I had high hopes that were QUICKLY confirmed. Poured up a nice cool tall glass. The smell wasn't as murky as I thought it would be. A strong thick, deep bodied, ale. I keep a bottle or two stocked in the fridge."
""
"O: A decent Abbey Dubbel but certainly not in the top tier of what the style has to offer. As with a lot of Belgian beers, you can't get sidetracked with okay beers when there are so many exceptional examples to choose from. A good, drinkable and easy to enjoy beer but not great when you consider what else is out there."
""
"O- Solid Belgian abbey ale. All the requisites of Belgian yeast, fruity esters, nice color, etc. etc. Something is missing that would make this a divinely sublime Belgian. Did I just say ""divinely sublime""? I really am not one of ""those"" beret wearing dudes who think they are special but reading this it looks like I am. I think it might be the 9.4% ABV talking."

"O-A pretty good BSDA, nothing exceptional. At first taste, I thought it was out of this world, but when I realized it was classified as a BSDA, I thought it was too tamed to be considered an exceptional BSDA.

Prickly bitterness up front, coriander, this fades quickly leaving sugary, plum after taste. Medium carbonation and medium body in general. A pretty good Belgian style ale overall, just not quite on par with the others I have had. Worth a taste."

"Overall: This is one of my favorite brews...I don’t normally fall in love with Belgian style beers, but this one is an exception…the sweet, caramel malts combined with spice and yeast bring a very drinkable brew that should be sipped on and appreciated…with it’s higher ABV (and fantastic taste) it’s not a beer to be filling up the beer pong cups with, this should be enjoyed in a circle of friends or by a fire with a loved one…if I had four of these, I could drink four of them, but as it is, I will enjoy just this one…I will definitely be getting this again for future pleasure…yum! (4/5)"

"Easily one of the best domestic versions of this style that I can recall having. This is light years better than the original version I can recall having back in 2005 or 2006 (and oh so much better than the crappy draft versions I've seen here on the East Coast). Very, very impressive...."

"Overall, it's a delightfully rich Belgian amber, very smooth, and almost syrupy."

"Having read another reviewer who noted the same problem, I wonder if the brewery knows about it? Someone should tell them -- Great beer at first, strange and awful secondary flavor / aftertaste...."

"For me, drinking this beer was like eating a choice cut, New York Deli sandwich between two slices of Wonder Bread. The meat's clearly there, but the bread just isn't strong enough to keep up. I'm a big fan of this beer, but I really wish it was consistently terrific."
""
""
"bread crust. Tastes are dark candi sugar, banana, spice, cinnamon, bready, molasses, tea leaf. Mouth-feel is creamy and smooth with ample carbonation. Overall, it's good, but the cinnamony spiciness is too forward. It's almost like a winter warmer Belgian dark ale with all that spiciness."

Very warming effect from the high alcohol. Subtle spiciness in the finish. Body is well carbonated. Overall this is decent. Not the best I've had. Could see this getting a little sickening though this style certainly isn't for sessions. Just a little too sweet and rich for my taste."

It wasn't awful, but things just didn't seem to come together well. The smell on the other hand, is the highlight, and quite something. It is very pleasing and I may just sacrifice the last oz. and use it in my oil burner."

""
"O: pleasant representation of the style. Slightly over powering sweetness, but over all nice balance."
"Pours a slightly murky honey brown with a foamy khaki head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, brown sugar, caramel, yeast, and spices. Taste is much the same with a mild spice bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer that is tasty and easy to drink."
"O- an interested strong ale, the flavors don't quite mesh for me but it is a nice warming drink for a cool all night. It will definitely sneak up on you."
""
""
""
""
"O - A tasty Belgian Dark Ale that nicely captures the flavour profile of the style. Glad I picked this one up an certainly worth checking out."
"Overall: The body of the beer is medium and the finish is full. This beer has a lot of potential, but fell down on a lot of fronts. To me, this beer could have had more body and could have been more refined in the flavor department. I felt that here is the flavors in the beer, take it. If the beer could have been finessed, this would be an outstanding dark ale. Alas, I am not the brewer, maybe this is how they intended to make it."

"O- I dont see myself revisiting this one again, My taste buds just don't agree with this one."
""
""
"Brother Thelonious begins with the familiar champagne ritual - untwisting the wire bail, edging the cork out a millimeter at a time until it comes free with a pop. The head is voluminous and creamy, but quickly subsides into a narrow, persistent band. The scent and flavor are matched. There is a touch of an alcohol bite, but not much considering the ABV. Then, a flood of raisin and prune, sweet and malty. I am very much reminded of the Corsendonk Christmas Ale. Since I haven't been able to find that around here the past few years, Brother Thelonius is a welcome addition!"
""
"O - Good complexity in the nose and great complexity on the tongue, I enjoyed that it stayed away from a big sweet profile yet still being full bodied."
"Big bottle from Tipples in Gainesville. Pouring lighter than expected, a light brownish red hue, with one finger off white head. This one smells of alcohol and a good bit of molasses and a hint of spicey fruit. The alcohol taste overwhelms the flavor. There are some dark fruits in the background of the booze, some spicy yeast. But mostly this has an astringent alcohol burn that covers the other flavors. Strange for something that's only 9%. Mouthfeel is medium with medium carbonation, but maybe it needs to be aged. Could use some work here."
"O - Good beer but I feel like it needed more carbonation. It was heavy, sweet, and rich but needed something to cut though that."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- I really like Northcoast, but I have to admit, this was not very impressive or well balanced to me. So many things could be different about this belgian, but it is a manageable beer. Personally, for the style, I doubt I would make my rounds to this again."
""
""
"O- A sweet tasting beer with a Belgian profile but a bit too cloying for my taste."
""
""
"A nicely balanced, richly complex example of this style. Very tasty if you are in search of a malt-forward beer with a decent alcohol kick."
""
"Poured into a goblet. Pours opaque dark caramel brown with a quickly dissipating two-finger length eggshell colored head. The aromas are typical for a strong Belgian ale. I detect the fruity bubblegum type aromas from the yeast, some sweetness, and some malt. The alcohol does have a strong presence in the aroma. The taste up front has all the characteristics you'd expect from a good Belgian dark ale. There's some darker malt flavors with caramel and dark fruits. Then I get that alcohol kick right afterwards that overrides quite a bit of those flavors. That's a bit disappointing because I wanted to really taste the other stuff that was happening here. The body is medium to full with moderate carbonation. The finish is slightly dry. This is a good beer, but could have been better if the alcohol flavors were masked better."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I am only 1/3 through the glass and feeling enormously tipsy. I don't mind Belgian-style beers for their high ABV, but this, despite decent flavor and feel all-around, is a bit of an alcoholic inducement gone haywire. I realize what North Coast was trying to do here, but compared to other dubbels, it doesn't quite work out. On the bright side, I could definitely see myself listening to hard bop drinking something like this over a glass of wine!"
""
""
""
""
""
"O – This is a good beer. Very tasty and drinkable with enough alcohol to remind you that you’re drinking a strong Belgian-style ale. It doesn’t have the greatest head retention or the fullest mouthfeel in the world, but it’s still a very nice offering from North Coast. I’m glad I got to try this one, and I’ll be looking for more from them."

"I don't know what it is about this beer, but every time I try to review it, I forget myself and end up neglecting to do the work. I suppose that's a sign of how good this beer is. Also, I've had different aged versions of this, so have had different flavor experiences with it. All have been good, of course. But I just want to make the effort to mention it so that it's known that it's a nice beer to age for a while. Overall, this is as close as you're going to get to a true Belgian style ale. Always reliable; always a pleasure to drink."
"Review from 5/2010 notes. Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Pours a dark orange brown with a thin light tan head that dissipates quickly, leaving light lacing. Aroma of dark fruit and light caramel malt. Light to medium body. Lightly sour and malty up front with light and dark fruits, boozy. Malty middle. Tart and sweet malt finish. Medium bodied. A different approach to a dubbel. Slightly sour for me, but an overall pleasant experience. Nice warm buzz too."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a dark amber color with a slight light brown head. Scent is mild with hibiscus, yeast, banana, and floral tones. The taste is bold and rich! Very well blended where it tastes so good yet it is difficult to pick out individual elements. Yeast, sugars, and floral tones are evident though. Smooth, tasty, and delicious, but with this size bottle I wish I had a beer buddy to share with…then again maybe not."
""
"O: Overall all a very good beer. It has a few areas where it could improve but has many things to offer."
""
"cheers."
"The folks at 775 Gastropub seem to dig this one a lot. I, on the other hand, do not. There's nothign particularly appealing about this beer other than the cool inspiration behind it. The head dissolves instantly, the flavor is sort of bland and the tastes that stand out aren't very good. North Coast can do better."
"overall, this is an average abbey style ale.. the smell was a bit different than the taste which was off putting since i was expecting a nice fruity subtle drink. it was harsh and boozy, and all of the flavors blended together and hid behind the alcohol taste."
"Overall: super impressed, this beer is greatly under rated for how unique its flavors are; would pair perfectly with a soft pretzel and a variety of mustards"

"The beer pours a hazy brown color with a white head. The aroma has a ton of toffee malt, as well as quite a bit of dark fruit. The flavor is somewhat similar. I get a lot of toffee and grain notes, as well as some brown sugar and some dark fruit. Overall, the beer is fairly sweet. There is also some noticeable alcohol present in the flavor. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
""

"Good beer, but nothing too special. A notch above most other dark Belgians. Great if you're looking for chocolate in your tulip."

"This was on recommendation by the server while visiting North Coast Brewery. I didn't know what to think at first with the dark chocolate color and the smell was quite flat. My opinion changed quickly after my first sip. The flavor was robust and full. I also enjoyed the aftertaste. It is what I would consider a comfort beer. I just wish I could find it in more local Bay Area stores in the smaller bottles than the 22 oz bottles as it's too much for me in 22 oz. Cheers!"

"O: Decent Strong Belgian ale. Nice sipping beer at 9.4%"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I can't believe I haven't had this popular beer by now. It's great, but the complexity of flavors is missing for me. I like many others in the style more than I like this, but I still wouldn't turn it down. Maybe it's the lack of hop bitterness to balance the sweet."

"There are better belgian dark ales out there, but this is still a pretty solid beer. The candy flavor for both the smell and taste doesn't fully work with me, but it isn't too dominating."
"definitely nothing special here. let down for sure. pours a transparent deeo ruby red color with a very small head that fades to nothing. smells malty, but not in a pleasant way, like something went rotten a little bit, sugary too, and just a hint of belgian yeast. flavor is about the same, off-putting malt character, a bit metallic, and overly sweet. feel is weird in the stomach, carbonation is fine, but something is just off about this one. im hoping i just got a bad bottle or something, but this was on the verge of undrinkable for me, thick and sweet and funked out. im reluctant to try it again, but i guess i have to at some point given the largely positive reviews. north coast has been a bit of a disappointment for me thus far."
""
""
""
"Overall - Another beer that treads around the Barley Wine style taste wise. It didn't really taste all that belgian to me. Lots of bold flavours going on though.. which makes it interesting. I'd buy it again."
"O: This isn't a bad beer, but it isn't overly memorable either. Doesn't necessarily stack up to its Belgian cousins."
""
""
"Overall: An interesting American take on a Dark Belgian ale. On the sweeter side but far from cloying. Pretty solid."
""
"Disappointing. Tastes way more like an IPA than a Belgian strong dark ale. I'm a malt guy. What can I say? The hop dominance was a rude surprise. Was expecting something sweeter like Delirium Nocturnum or Trois Pistoles. But it's much more like Ommegang BPA, which has the look of a Belgian strong ale, but the flavor of an APA. Oh, well."
""
"O: North Coast is at it again, though Brother Thelonious is a different breed of tasty beverage. I’m not sure I’d buy it again, but I’m definitely not done with this brewery. Not at all."
"O: Flavors aren't bad, just strong. Nothing that would make it undrinkable, only takes back from the balance of the beer."

"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, bottled 12/13/2010. Pours slightly hazy dark reddish copper color with a fairly dense 1-2 finger dark khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Some nice soapy lacing clings to the glass, with a fair amount of carbonation streaming up. Aromas of big raisin, plum, banana, molasses, pepper, clove, caramel, toasted biscuit, dark candi sugar, yeast spices, and a bit of alcohol. Some pretty nice aromas, with good complexity and balance. Taste of big caramel, raisin, toffee, prune, molasses, banana, chocolate, dark candi sugar, light pepper, toasted biscuit, and yeast spices. Lingering notes of caramel, molasses, raisin, prune, banana, candi sugar, biscuit, chocolate, and light pepper on the finish for a good bit. Very nice flavor balance with no cloying sweetness at all. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with fairly creamy and slightly slick mouthfeel. Very smooth to sip on; with only an alcohol warming present after the finish. Overall this is a really nice Belgian dark ale. Really nice flavor balance and complexity; and very enjoyable to sip on."

"Brother Thelonious pours a very dark amber color , with very little head. The smell is a bit boozy, and there is alot of barrel like aromas. The taste is full of Belgium candies, a bit sweet, and just a bit warm from the alcohol. Nice full body flavor, everything blends nicely. Overall this is a good beer, nothing crazy, but a nice simple high quality strong dark ale."

"Poured this beer out of a bottle into a chimay glass and the result was a head that disappeared very fast. The smell was of dark fruits and maybe a little olive brine. The taste was sour, of brine, liquor, and bitter hops. The mouth feel is good, silky with good carbonation. This beer had no lacing to be seen. The color is mahogany as stated above in its beer advocate description. I was very disappointed in this brew its not worth the price i paid."

"O: Not as complex as it should be, but relatively satisfying and smooth. A must have for raisin fans."

"This poured a darked brown, without a lot of foam. The aroma is not too strong, which turns out to be not terribly surprising as this is a fairly sweet beer. There is a slight bitterness which tends more towards the charred malt side than the hoppy side, there is no obvious hoppiness, perhaps some to cut the sweetness of the malt. This is actually a very drinkable beer, and goes down very easily, but in my opinion the balance is just a little off."

"Overall - I was expecting to be blown away by Thelonious, but instead what I got was a decent beer that comes off more as a Winter Warmer than a Belgian Abbey Ale. It's an alright beer, but not worth the price I paid for it."
""
""
"O- Meh. Not my style, not my beer."
""
"O- when I first cracked this baby the smell was promising... but that was the bright spot. A slightly above average Dubbel but as it warms up the flavor doesn't hold up to the alcohol. Not at all worth 14 bucks a four pack but definitely worth a shot on tap or from a mix and match."
"O: A respectable U.S. version of the style, but far short of the best Belgians. More similar to a barleywine than your typical Belgian strong dark ale."

"It was a cold night by the fire, poured into a goblet from the bottle. Very dark brown with moderate head and lacing. The aroma was sweet, raisins and cinnamon maybe, overripe fruit but in a good way. The taste was heavy, but smooth with clean finish. I personally didn't pick up on the alchol bite when I was drinking it, but it snuck up on me by the bottom of the glass! I recommend it, but not a world beater. And remember it's a bit stonger than the average beer!"
"O: There are more readily available, and better IMHO, of this style. That being said, a solid representation of the style, albeit spicy. Maybe some aging would help tone down the alcohol."

"750ml bottle purchased at Fiddlehead Farms in Dover, NH. Pours a crystal-clear copper-brown with a good inch or so of khaki-colored head. Smells fruity with caramel and nutty notes. Fruity and spicy, with distinct caramel, toffee, chocolate, and nut notes playing fairly equal roles. Medium bodied with ample carbonation. Pretty tasty - balanced and robust without being in your face. A little less dry than many versions I've had, but I don't mind that in the slightest. Excellent."

"O - A solid BSDA, not overly complicated but quite enjoyable."

"O - An okay beer. It has some good qualities but nothing really pops for me, especially in the taste. I do like that North Coast makes a donation to the Thelonious Monk Institute of Jazz for every bottle sold. I think that helps make this beer worth a try."

"Pours out a dark cola color with a brown head. Sweetness is right upfront with candied fruits and a hint of carmel. Bready overtones too. A little more than medium mouthful and is hand in hand with the smell of candied sweetness. Definitely can taste the alcohol burn at 9.4% maltiness is pretty present over the hops. A very good night cap or slow sipping beer in my opinion."
""
"It's a nice example of the style overall, but it doesn't really bring anything very special or original to the table, especially considering the jazz legend it's named after. Still, a worthwhile beer and one I'd recommend especially to people with a taste for sweeter, spice-heavy beers."

"Overall - Overall, I enjoyed it a great deal. Gotta love the Belgian styles!"

"Not bad, but certainly doesn't stand up to it's Belgian counterparts, nor even some of the better American brewed examples. Definitely worth trying, but it doesn't make my list of go-to's for the style."
"This is an ok beer, the alcohol content is cleverly disguised as I could not detect a whiff of it. I'll have this again."
""
""
""
"Overall Impression- Would Brother Thelonious be impressed by this one? I don't think so. Needs some work. More complexity, body, and more character would make a good starting point. I'm glad I got this in the 12oz form and not the 750mL bottle! Wouldn't recommend for this style... Very average all around."

"Brother Thelonious is a cloudy, brown ale with a thin, dense, sand colored head that leaves nice lacing on the glass. It has a big, fruity aroma with notes of prunes, figs, raisins, cherries, candy, brown sugar and cookies. It's pretty full bodied but a little sharp to the tongue. It leaves the mouth a little numb and gritty. It kind of tastes like fruit cake, but not so sweet. Plum and molasses are detected. There a light bitterness at the finish. There's quite a bit of flavor here and the fruitiness lingers well after the swallow. It's pretty tasty stuff."
""
"It had been a while since I’ve had this and I must say that I really enjoyed it much more this time around. There’s lots of rich sweetness and fruit flavor to this, yet it possesses just enough assertiveness from the yeast and malt as well to help keep things balanced on the platate. My only complaint here is the overall heft of this, as it just got to be a bit taxing to finish this bottle by myself. I could have easily split this 16.9 oz bottle with another. Anyway,this is a good one to help take the winter chill of with!"
""
""

"Nothing amazing here but this is a solid dubbel. I wish they had gone for a more unorthodox take on the style for a more fitting tribute to it's namesake but I'd buy this anyway if it was available to me."
"O: Not bad, but certainly not my favorite. I have a second bottle that I'd like to see age a bit. Perhaps I'll review it again in about 18 months."
"O: reminds me of Pannepot (which is considered a quad) more than say Gulden Draak (a BSDA), but then again, it's been a while since I had a Gulden Draak. A good-tasting beer, not my favorite style necessarily, but certainly worth a try, especially if you're into strong dark ales."

"This is a bit one dimensional to me. Once the finish comes around, I hope for something more to kick in or to let my palate down a bit slow, but to no avail. Not bad, but not great. I think there are better interpretations to style."

"O: This is the fourth beer in the four pack, but I let it hang out in the fridge for 6 months. From what I can recall about the first three, the aging did it some good in terms of blending the flavors. It is definitely on the sugary molasses side, but it remains rather drinkable right up to the end. The alcohol scent doesn’t translate into the taste, which I find to be a good thing. The alcohol and sugar does start to dominate the nose after the first half of the beer is down. I think this beer is much better with some age on it. I will consider putting some away again as I enjoyed the aged bottle more than the fresh."
"Overall: A great dessert beer. Chocolatey goodness in a bottle. Nice and heavy. Drink slowly and enjoy the buzz."
"O - Average dark ale with alcohol not masked at all."
"Overall, a clean and refreshing Belgian, with a subtly distinct flavor."
"While I don't particularly care for the eponymous artist's musical style, I do quite like BSDAs. So, it somewhat irks me, that this offering is so, well, simple. Drinkable, I suppose, but lacking that usual dense, complex oomph that usually pulls me in, and convinces me to stay."
"In conclusion This is something you share, not only because it’s a tasty one but because it’s just a bit over the top on the sugary side. A solid psuedo-Abbey that obviously doesn’t play in the major leagues but is on occasion called for a try out batting session."
"Overall, its a beer that wins a spot in my fridge any day of the week. Its not a special occation beer, but it is worthy of a once a weeker."
"Overall- This is a very love/hate beer and style I suppose. This isn't a drinkable liquid to me however."
"As for its namesake, Thelonius Monk, try 'Alone in San Francisco.' One of my favorite jazz cds. Of course either of the Monk w Coltrane cds is a winner as well. Thanks to North Coast for honoring this great musician."
"I like this beer it has broad appeal but lacks depth or richness like the top shelve versions."
"This is embarrassing for this brewery - I can't believe they put this crap out on the market. They should be ashamed of themselves. I don't care if I never taste Ruedrich's Red Seal ever again - this brewery deserves not a cent of my money for putting this beer out. They will never get a cent of my money again. This beer is shameful. I don't support the idea of good breweries putting out shit beers and thinking they can make money off of them just because they have a good reputation and because THEY THINK THEY CAN FOOL PEOPLE BY CHARGING AN INORDINATE AMOUNT FOR IT. Beer drinkers are not fools, North Coast - I'm sorry. I will have no part of giving you another cent. What a joke."
"Overall, it was a fun beer to try, and if anyone want a strong one, they should try it. Although, I'd have to say, if there was a bomber of this beer, I don't think I can finish a bottle on my own without becoming a bit out of it! 9.4% ABV will do that to you, and if that's your cup of tea, go for it!"
"Sampled on September 22, 2011. When the caged, corked top is removed there is an abundance of smoky carbonation. The pour is a decent looking reddish-brown but the head dissolves quickly. The aroma tends to remind me more of wine than beer but it has an inviting character with its toast and apricot fruit. The body is around medium. The 9.4% ABV is noticed in the flavor right off and it certainly smacks me across the face with its potentcy. It tends to take over the taste. Complex but dry at the end."
"Overall: A good beer, especially if you enjoy sweeter beers. My favorite aspect was the mouthfeel which was very creamy and enjoyable. I would be happy to drink more of it, but I'm not sure I would buy it again since it is priced similarly to many other higher caliber Belgian ales."
"First taste, I cringed with how it felt in my mouth. Crazy after-taste and feel in the back of my throat and on my tongue. Very sweet malts. Toast with an apple spread and a whole lot of metal-something that makes my mouth feel like I need to brush my teeth. Unbalanced. The Belgium-style aspects of this beer are what redeem it enough to be worth of a 3.0 for taste, but the feel in my mouth was just bad. I was tempted not to finish it."
"TheBeerAlmanac.com"
"pretty good for a belgian style abbey ale. although i haven't tried to many at this point in my drinking days i can only hope they're all this good"
"This brew poured out as a dark reddish brown color, the head was a cream color and looked pretty fluffy. The smell of the beer had some dark malt aromas giving off a little sweetness and some bready Belgian yeast as well. The taste of the beer has a little bit of dark fruit in the mix along with some earthy notes. The mouthfeel was about average for me on this one, it's smooth but just doesn't wow me. Overall this beer isn't bad, I know a lot of people who love it but I've had it a few times and I still haven't been overly impressed by it."
"O: Sort of a blah Belgian, with a very saturated sugar content. I liken this to eating a mallow creme dessert during the fall season. I friggin hate those things! However, this is slightly better."
"The beer seems to lack a ""middle", it rushes to the dry finish which is a bit astringent."
"Overall: This is one of my favorite American Belgian strong ale's. It's solid in all the areas that it needs to be."
"O - I was excited about this beer, but unfortunately it did not meet my expectations."
"O/D: Maybe this beer needs some time to rest. It was tasty, but not all that enjoyable, if that makes sense."
"O: More like a malt liquor with residual sweetness and big alcohol burn."
"o: worth the try, wouldnt turn down a free one but probably wont buy again anytime soon."
"The mouthfeel is by far the best part with a fine champaign like carbonation and a great dry finish. However the mouthfeel being great doesn't make up for a lackluster taste. This beer is a solid pass if you ever see it. A shame because I love the rest of north coast's lineup that I've tried."
"O: Maybe not a benchmark of the style but this beer is a real pleasure to drink, and I’ve enjoyed it every time I’ve had it."
"O: Very disappointed with this one. I can't find anything satisfying with this beer. It's too sweet, tart, and intruding carbonation. I will defiantly wouldn't recommend and won't be buying another bottle. Rather go for a chimay [blue]."
"Overall - pretty decent brew, and fairly interesting in taste. Not the most interesting that I've tasted or that you'll find, but still captivating enough."
"O: Not as drinkable as it could be as it doesn't hide the alcohol very well."
"O- Perhaps this was a bad bottle?? I tried tweaking my review...can't....I am shocked at how bad this was."
"Carbonation could be higher, body thicker."
"O: This is a pretty good Belgian Dark Strong Ale. It's complex but the more I drink the more the flavors become muddled together. Not necessarily a bad thing, just not as exciting as the first few sips. There is no sign of the 9.4% abv and the flavors are rather pleasant. Give it a try to taste it for yourself."
"Overall a nice beer. Very sweet, but a nice accompaniment with the strong alcohol presence."
"O-This is as good as an dubbel I've ever had. Very tasty...very drinkable. Will be getting more to try again and solidify my feelings. But...I like this!"
"Complex, easy drinking, SBDA. This is one of my favorites from North Coast, and it never disappoints."
"O - Too sickly sweet for me and not really authentic enough."
"Satisfying, easy to drink but not as much depth as other fine Belgian Abbey ales."
"Highly drinkable, and an ale worth trying. However, it is not an ale I would go out of my way to get."
"O-Decent beer, definitely not the best of the style but it is a valid interpenetration of the style."
"O - I don't dislike it, but I don't taste any of the refinement of all of the abbey ales I like so much. It might just be a marketing gimmick to call it a Belgium style abbey ale. It is a fine beer, and better than most mass-manufactured American tripe. But in the end, it has no real personality or uniqueness at all."
"O- not the best example of the style. the traditional brewers in belgium have much better examples for the most part. i wouldnt mind picking up another one and sitting on it for a while. it wouldnt exactly be a costly experiment."
"Overall it was ok, but I don't know if I'd seek it out again. Not one of the better Belgian Dark Ales I've had, but wasn't the worst either."
"Serving type: draft"
"750ml bottle. 2006 vintage brought out by jdiddy. Pours a deep mahogany with a swirl of foam comprising the head. Nose expresses candied dark fruits (figs, raisins, prunes) and a boozy quality. Taste is not as sweet as anticipated by the nose; however, the dark fruit still shines through. There's also a trace of oxidation that comes out towards the back. Mouthfeel is medium-light in body with a lively carbonation. A pretty tasty brew that has definitely held up well over time. Might be worth throwing a few in the cellar."
"O: A pretty unimpressive BSDA. It's all around just bland, ugly, and has very little carbonation for a style that should have a lot."
"O- If offered, I'd try again. But I don't think I'd seek this one out again. Not one of my fav BSDA's"
"A mahogany color with a creamy fluff of white head that drops down the glass to leave a thick ring. Nose brings a lot of syrupy malt(toffee) complimented by some fig fruitiness. Flavor starts with a roasted malt and molasses sweetness. Shortly after a lot of the darker fruit flavors show through (raisins, figs and sweet plum) The ABV% quickly comes through but doesn't bite. A smooth dry finish similar to Merlot or Pinot."
"Expensive, and despite being complex, not anything that I will come back too."
"This beer is okay, but I would not go out of my way to have it again."
"Overall: A very nice offering from North Coast, staple goto beer for the style. Very enjoyable and well brewed. And the props to Thelonious Monk are an added plus."
"Overall, a decent belgian ale, but one that you need to remind yourself that it is big, a touch boozy, but a decent drop for the cooler months."
"This brew pours a rich ruby hue with decent carbonation that leaves behind a two finger head and sporadic clingy lacing,the smell is prunes,dried cherries,dark plums and fruit mince pies,it has a medium bodied almost syrupy averagely carbonated mouthfeel to it and has tastes of dried cherries,white port,fruit mince pies and finshes with a dark fruit bitterness and overall its alright"
"O: Malty and sweet with a slight bitterness for balance. Can hardly taste the alcohol"
"Mouthfeel - Thinner than I expected, but nicely carbonated and a good rich finish and aftertaste."
"good, but nowhere near great, beer."
"This excellent BSDA pours a deep brown with a hint of red, offering a decent, tan, creamy head. Lots of fig, carmel, dark fruit and alcohol all mingle in perfect harmony with this beer. Go easy, it's almost 10%. The overall taste/flavor is of carmel, fig, sugar, alcohol, malt and mellow ""un""hoppy hops (if that's possible). Brother T is a smoother, deeper, sweeter and more 3-dimensional inviting drink than Chimay Blue, which I felt was good, but more one-dimensional and less ""crafted"" tasting. Brother T is a great beer for those looking to begin experiencing the Abbey style beers. I will buy this beer for years to come."
"Overall I'm enjoying this quite a bit.  Has a nice, complex flavor, but the booziness has me sipping."
"Appearance pours a dark brown with a fair head that dissapates fairly quickly. Smell of sweet malt, belgian style yeast and spice. Taste again has thick rich sweet malt, spice, some dark fruits and the belgian style yeastiness. Mouthfeel is heavier and viscous with good carbonation. Not the best I've tried in a abbey ale, but still a good sipper."
"This a solid brew. Complex and tasty."
"Narrative: Waylon Brannings ate the same tuna fish sandwich for lunch, wore the same mauve suit on Thursdays, and was the paradigm of predictability. However, he was the best analyst at Association for the Study of Peak Oil and Gas. Some would say that he is forgettable, he would sharply reply that ASPOG is the most influential organization supporting the ""peak oil"" theory, meaning that future oil supply will be much less than commonly expected, and he will make sure that you know all about it. Specialized to a fault and forgettable at worst, his mahongany shoes click the floor metronomically while he works at the whiteboard. It is always interesting to meet someone new, however, most people forget old Waylon after he leaves the room. That doesn't make his mission any less important: To study depletion, taking due account of economics, demand, technology and politics of natural gas. Most people wont dislike him, they simply wont remember him."
"overall i like it. again, nothing here that will be in any 'world class' conversations, but a more than passable american take on a belgian dark; certainly holds its own."
"This beer is certainly worth a try and is a decent representation of the style. I would by a pint or a single bottle once and a while. Unfortunately there are far better versions of this style at the same price point. I'd rather grab a Brooklyn Local #2 or Chimay (Blue)."
"Taste has quite a bit dates in it, chocolate, and maybe fig. Overall a nice dubbel style ale, maybe a little sweet, but pairs nicely with some good meat. Medium body, light carbonation. Overall a good American version of my favorite style beer."
"I enjoyed this beer on tap at The Beer Trappe in Lexington Ky. It poured a deep ruby red with a large cream colored head. It smells of yeast and figs. The initial taste is sweet almonds almost like a cognac that fades to dates and raisins. The mouthfeel is slightly thin with minimal astringency. Overall I prefer Ommegang Abbey or Chimay Red."
"This beer enjoyed at the Abner pub in Norman, OK in an Orval chalice. The beer pours a deep red color with a trace of off white head that doesn't leave much lacing. The aroma is string with caramel and fig notes. The taste is similar but very sweet. The mouthfeel is fairly empty and doesn't finish clean. Overall worth a try."
"Final thought - $13 for 4 bottles is high. If you like abbey style ales, gotta get this one for sure"
"This beer has a decent appearance.... dark amber with a nice head. No carbonation issues as noted by previous reviewers. Honestly this is a fairly heavy beer, and it taste quite better as it warms up/as i get buzzed. @ 9.4% it is no joke. This beer is not deceptive or afraid to show it's face. Aroma like candy, caramel, and sour apple fruit. Taste is fairly bitter.. but not hops or alcohol. A little rough around the edges."
"I wouldn't suggest picking up this premium beer, unless you want to take gain from the donation made by purchasing each bottle."
"The aroma was very nice, a little bit ruddy at first. Hints of chcoalte and caramel, rich belgian spice and a wonderful bit of dark fruit all dancing around wonderfully inside of it. But it was once I took a sip that everything really came together for me. A wave of cascading brown sugar and tart apples just rolled across the tongue. Enormously rich and vigorous, this was just a wonderful thing to behold. Nice touches of chocolate and rich toffee like notes were all balanced well in advance of a lovely dark fruit tone that led the charge once the yeast kicked in. Nice notes of prunes and rasins, hints of plums and dark cherries were all very much evident in the profile. The carbonation was spot on, as the rich, velvet like bubbles converged on the tongue and added to the prickly pepper like spices that lasted long into the finish. Smooth as silk with almost all the alcohol very well hidden, this was certainly a gem."
"Overall: Absolutely a must try, not my everyday beer style, but WOW, North Coast has once again set the bar by not playing it safe and releasing a lame beer, this is a very good beer."
"Great aromas when allowed to warm up and gets high points for the appearance. The spice was hard to detect. Still don't know what style this is. Try it out for yourself."
"I could easily enjoy another one of these in the future, but it was a bit of a letdown the beer lacked a bit of character as the pieces were all over the place instead of working well together."
"M - Good carbonation. A little thin for a higher gravity beer (9.4%). If not for the alcohol, this would be very drinkable."
"Some beers are more fun because of the label/marketing and this is one. And that's okay with me."
"I think Monk would be proud of this brew. It is not a traditional Belgian Strong Dark, i.e. the head is not humongous, the carbonation is not very bright, and it is not as dry as others I have tasted, but, damn, is it one flavorful, off-beat mutha. Hey man, it don't mean a thing if it ain't got that swing..."
"O: Solid. Not world-class, but solid, and a decent drinker."
"ENJOY!!!"
"O: A pretty good beer. The mouthfeel is the best part of it. Worthwhile to have one."
"Food Pairing: Grilled Pork, Roasted Pork, Goat Cheese, Chedder, Fresh Mozz, Roasted Chicken, Vinegary Items, Ham, Chutneys, Medium Spicy Foods."
"Avarage beer."
"Overall a good beer but a bit much - somewhat cloying. There are a lot of way better dubbels to be had, although it was ok once the food came."
"Simply, I like the beer and I like the cause. Whatever the style he's playing, it tastes like the brewer loved it! Cheers, jazz and beer fans!"
"I think you can sum up this beer pretty succinctly by just saying: It's a very well done Belgian dubbel/BSDA, with some unexpected roasted malt character. Will definitely buy again."
"I would have liked to listen to some Thelonious Monk while I drank it but my wife hates Thelonious Monk so I spared her that hardship."
"Poured a dark amber red, with minimal white head, not much of a smell and minimal carbination. Could not identify many flavors other than pepper, and even a smokiness. No dark fruits, but perhaps a light citrus that was more near the back end of the taste. Some alcohol taste, but not overwhelming. A decent beer, but I was expecting a little more."
"drinkability is good but for me it had way too much carbonation. flavors are very nice though."
"Good beer, but there definitely are better examples of the style out there."
"Tastes of cherry, raisin, plum, and a bitter slightly licorice taste - very nice. Mouthfeel is beautiful with sweetness up front followed by a sting from carbonation and finishing with a crisp dry bitterness."
"D - Not shabby. Good, even. The mouthfeel kind of distracts from the taste, which makes me wish the latter were stronger."
"Drinkability is ok. Although the alcohol comes through in the nose, it's not really there in the taste, though the mouthfeel does take some points from the drinkability."
"The beer is dark brown color with reddish highlights and a thin, bubbly, tan colored head. The smell is mainly coloa, molasses, fig and spice. It tastes of dates and smokey caramel, there is a bit of peppery spiciness to it and an earthy aftertaste. It feels light, the carbonation is perfect, the abv is hidden well and it has a nice dry finish. This is a quality brew but it's not outstanding. I wouldn't seek it out but would definitely drink it."
"I am going to have to give this a complete pass. This beer is just flat our boring."
"The mouthfeel was full/medium and it had plenty of carbonation. Actually better than I was expecting."
"I've seen this bottle in stores for the past couple years and just finally got around to try it. Not bad but I'm not sure I'd make it a regular purchase although the price wasn't too bad for what it is."
"Poured into a snifter from a bottle. Has 2 fingers of tan head with lacing. Smells of dark malt with some fruity tones. Very drinkable. The alcohol was hidden well. Color was dark color of coffee. As you swirl the volatiles release more fruity and malt. Great beer."
"Mouthfeel is kind of fluffy, and a strange combination of watery and dry. Sweetness is just a little much for me, but fairly good for the style."
"D: Went down nicely, could feel the ABV, but would definitely order again."
"Pours a deep mahogany with reddish tints. Minimal light tan foam head. Nose is light and dark fruits, biscuity malt, cloves, banana esters and slightly phenol. Taste is what you'd expect but noticeably smooth and all the flavours blend together very well. There's the Belgian flavoured malt character and spices with banana and raison notes. Mouthfeel is heavy. Paired well with a grilled pumpernickle rye turkey sandwhich. If I recall, seemed pricey to merit multiple purchases. Enjoyed nonetheless and sparked reinterest in the style."
"One I will repeat in the future. Overall a very nice Belgian Strong Dark Ale."
"Insanely drinkable. ABV is incredible well hidden. I had this beer AFTER I had the 2010 Jubelale also on tap. This beer is the epitome of a sleeper. Just a great beer"
"D - Becomes monotonous the more you drink of it. I would recommend splitting with a friend. Alcohol not high enough to really give you a kick. Just a little too sweet/sour for my liking."
"For a beer that costs twice as much as the other five beers I bought tonite, I was not entirely impressed. Easy to drink for the high alcohol volume"
"I don't have much experience with the style, but overall I really enjoyed this brew. Gotta love the name and bottle and cause too."
"Overall this is a really really good beer, which I had no expectations of as it was a gift, but it was a joyous surprise. Well balanced and I think a solid brew; it's just what I look for in a Belgian abbey/dubbel."
"D - 9.4%, its drinkable! Brings a warming sensation down and into the belly. Enjoyable, especially the mouth feel."
"D= Very drinkable as it well balanced and not too ""extreme"". While there is an alcoholic ""bite", it does not come across as 9.4% abv."
"This is a good beer but it doesn't stick out to me."
"T: Yeast and malt sweetness with a creamy mouthfeel. Alcohol was a little too present for me and this one burned going down like something much stronger than 9%. Good, but not North Coast's best."
"Drink is decent, some booze, drier but little sticky finish."
"This is a nice beer, not the best BSDA but very good."
"D- Easily drinkable as mentioned before, perhaps good or not good based on alcohol and preference. Definitely not a quad but good all in all. Perhaps this is just not my favorite beer style."
"Tightly carbonated, a 750ml is more than enough."
"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass, the beer is a very cloudy, almost murky, reddish-brown coloring. Very translucent around the edges. It had a slight film of head on pour, but was gone by the time I sat down with the glass. The beer has a sweet, toasty smell to it, with bits of toffee and earth. The beer is carbonated and sharp on the front of the tongue, paving the way for a darkly sweet mid-bodied rush over the tongue. Sour notes at the back of the tongue, with caramel, raisin, and apple flavors. The beer feels awkward in mouth, and the flavors don't seem to blend well. The finish is sharp and quick, and the aftertaste is a sour earthy taste that leaves some sense of a film in your mouth. Not one that I would reach for seconds, and I'm glad I only picked up a loose bottle."
"d- I thought this was a pretty good solid beer and I will be really interested to see what this one would do with some age on it."
"I liked this beer a lot a few years ago-- and now, I'm so disappointed. I can't believe this is the same beer. I'm so sad about this. This has either changed, or I have, but in either case, it isn't for the better in terms of this beer."
"Drinkability is good for about one 12oz bottle, but like I mentioned, the sweetness is a little overpowering. Taking the rich fuit flavors and mixing in a more balanced dark malt character would make a tremendous beer in my opinion."
"This abby ale pours a dark brown with red tones when held up to the light. There is not much head bu the beer is well carbonated. Only a slight ring lingers along the glass. I smell sweet malt funky yeast, some light touches of maybe plum/ booze also penetrate the bouquet of the Brother Thelonious. I have to say the first taste of this beer is sweet sweet malt mixed with some bready yeast flavors. I also get a raisin after taste. The mouthfeel is nice and thin and the just right carbonation does enough to keep the flavors moving across my palate. I think this is a very drinkable beer that I would buy and enjoy again."
"Overall this was a beer with high potential but lacked in a couple areas for mine. Just too sweet and i feel that Belgians should be on the drier side. The flavors are great but are all competing with each other instead of blending together. Maybe it just needed some aging time. I'll have to try that next time."
"I really like an Abbey Ale with pork or beef. This one's no exception to the rule."
"dark amber/brown color and jazzy undertones. A beer with sound? Yes! My brotherman has candied sugar, caramel apples, and a rich and mellow smoothness that time has made pure. It's actually really splendid, sugary mouthfeel that isn't too sweet, just rich and delectable. I sipped and enjoyed. This beer is pure pleasure with some age on it. Not nearly as good fresh, maybe a B beer. This fella? Oahh yeah. The bubblegum that sometimes is prominent was totally faded. Just really nice malts with some hints of the yeast. Totally integrated."
"cheers"
"Drinkability: This isn't a shining example of a belgian dark ale. Pick up a Chimay if you want this kind of beer. The bottle is cool though even if the illustration of the beer is somewhat misleading."
"I've had this beer several times over the years, and it's never made a strong impression on me. Merely an OK example of the style."
"Was ok. I was excited about trying it but a bit let down. Didn't have quite the flavor I was expecting. Not bad, just nothing to write home about. Everything was average, shared it on Christmas with my uncle and we both had the same reaction to it. I won't buy it again because I'll be trying to find another Belgian SDA I like better"
"D - Drinkable, but lacking the complexity and head that an abbey ale ought to have."
"6 months later: ditto. Hmmm. It may be a little mellower. But it's not much better. Still a bit too yeast dominated a Belgian. Stong Belgian. I think I have one left. I'll let it sit longer."
"Chocolate imperial flavor,malty. Good beer when your getting close to the end of your beer session. Strong,creeps up on you. Good beer. The color and smell are the best parts of this beer. Similar to the rasputin but sweeter. Worthy for a repeat on a cold day..."
"Conclusion: I liked this one. My only real complaint was the M/F. I would have liked a more softer carbonation. Nonetheless, I liked the dark fruit sweetness."
"This beer drinkable and delicious."
"Brother Theolonius is comparable to the same brewer's Pranqster as New Belgium's 2 Below is to Fat Tire - it is mostly just a stronger version with more of the good stuff. The malts have a honey-like quality and are quite aromatic. The alcohol content will surely give you a warm feeling. This is one of the best beers I have ever enjoyed."
"drinkability is not good - off flavors - maybe a got a bad bottle but it will be a while before i buy another"
"Overall this is a must try, I had it a long time ago and forgot how great it is. Well balanced and I think a solid dessert brew it's just what I look for in a belgian abbey ale."
"A 750 of this would be perfect for sharing with a partner."
"D: Drinks like a 7% or so. Definitely one to purchase now and again. Definitely a great beer to have with a selection of cheeses or other sharp appetizer. Could also take the place of desert."
"Dark mahogany with some brown. Very clear, 1/4"" head at pour, dissapates to thin ring around edge, and some smoke on face. Maltiness in aroma, candied sweetess, dark raisiny fruit. Dark fruit also found in flavor. Alcohol burn, high carbonation. Not a lot to flavor in end, lots of sweetness up front, light caramel, almost an apply character in middle. Not much in aftertaste, slightly mediciny finish, not as dry as I would expect for style. Decent, not as good as I remembered havin the first time."
"Another fine offering from north coast, really i love what these guys are doing. Nice Dark, fruity, Carmelley intense beer. just what i am looking for from an american-belgium beer. I'll pick this one up whenever i see it on the shelves. Excellent beer here."
"Its taste has some of the aforementioned notes, along with molasses and is warming with the alcohol. MF has a good texture. Drinkability is about average with the sweetness and alcohol in the beer. It is a good beer, but not a great beer for this style."
"D Yes. Good beer, but the high alcohol keeps It from being a quaffer. 4 "
"Drinkability is very good for one, but the alcohol is strong enough to keep me from even thinking about another. Still, it's not like I can taste the full 9.4% - it's much more like 7% to the taste."
"This is a good brew. I didn't detect roasted malts in the nose, but they are prevailent in the taste. It does well to mask the alcohol."
"Drinkability: A drinkable and accessible Belgian dark ale. It certainly doesn't match up to its Belgian counterparts but it is a decent interpretation of the style. I could see it being used to introduce people to the taste and flavor of Belgian beers. All in all, it's quite tasty and I'm happy to have it knowing the money goes to a good cause."
"Overall: This beer is one that I'd wanted to try for some time, but always passed it up in the store for other brews that seemed more interesting. Seems I was right most of the time. I may revisit this one at a later date, but not anytime real soon. I feel it falls short of what it aspires to be."
"Overall: Pretty much an average dibble at best. Not a ton of mouthfeel or complexity. Drinkable though but I wouldn't really want to."
"Pours with almost TOO Much head that takes its sweet time dying down, to amass upon a bloodorange body. The smell is almost TOO muted for the strength, which is a plus, but its TOOO MUTED. I'm getting some over ripe grapes, fig, and rum raisin but thats taking HUGE sniffs. Tastes really really yummy. Everything is in balance, but its MUTED. I don't know how they made a 9.4%er this smooth. Again, props, NC. Has a slightly spicy medium body with a sticky finish. Could be worse but could be better. This is the most drinkable 9.4%er I've had. People say how Lobotomy Bock is 10.8% and smooth....yeah right that beer is like 4%....I always recommend they try this one and see which one gets them krunk first. haha cheers NC!"
"Yeah, not a bad brew, but nothing that's going to excite you beyond redemption. I'd happily drink it again, and would probably even select it again, but maybe only if there was not a new, and potentially more exciting option available."
"Poured it into to a glass, it came out a brownish red color, and gave about a three finger head that to my delight stuck around for awhile. To me it had more of a homemade wine taste, I don't no why it could have been old, but I throughly enjoyed it. I'm planning to pick up a bottle wherever I can find it. I would suggest this to anyone. Good Job North Coast Brewing."
"Don't know why it took me so long to have this one, but I'm not afraid of it any more! Smooth and drinkable but deceptively high in ABV."
"D: it is a decent belgian ale, but nothing makes it stand out"
"Pics at: http://definitionale.com/2010/10/19/tasting-the-north-coast-brother-thelonious/"
"Cheers."
"This beer wasn't great, nor was it bad. Just good."
"this is almost worth the price about 13 bones for a 4 pack, but a portion of each sale of this beer goes to a Jazz Music foundation or something. North Coast does have better beer at better prices i.e. Russian Imperial Stout."
"Kind of a boring beer, really. Mostly just a sweet beer. It isn't bad nor disgusting, however it's thin and not too complex. For style, I can get better beers."
"D- It's a good enough BSDA but not particularly outstanding IMHO. It has all the right ideas but lacks that certain pizzazz and complexity of some of the more standout examples of the style."
"I drank this with dinner, a dark beer with quite a kick. It did not overwhelm the food (ham), and was very smooth. It was in a corked bottle, very tasty. It had a very nice color, and poured with a prodigious head. Part of the proceeds goes to support the Thelonius Monk Institute of Jazz."
"D: Unimpressed, but not disappointed. Far too sweet with no cut for my taste."
"This Dubbel is just okay, nothing compared to some of its Belgian counterparts. On the other hand, if you dig jazz, grab a bottle or two--at least you know there's a good cause to get behind."
"If you like the style give it a try but for me and at 9.4% it's just a keep away."
"Pours a deep brownish red with one finger head, quickly fading. Not bad looking but not really distinctive. Aroma is a different story - a brilliant complexity increasing with warming. Note of raisins, apples, cherries and perhaps other fruit in the nose with a hint of brown sugar and alcohol lurking behind the prominence of the fruit. Taste is also quite interesting and complex. Caramel malt and all that fruit up front. Alcohol bite seems to ride in the middle. Easy on the hops bitterness, slight sour quality at the back. Sweet bread finish. Medium mouthfeel, average for style. Not grasping for more than one at once, but quite enjoyable as a stand alone experience."
"Wasn't too impressed by the bottle but really liked the on-tap version. I need to give this one another shot and would recommend this one to people who like Belgians or sours."
"Final Notes: Yet another solid (albeit high-octane) offering from North Coast. Makes a great dessert or winter beer. Highly recommended."
"While not a great beer, very much not a bad one either. The sweetness reminded me a bit of a fruit beer. Definitely worth a try, but won't become one of my regular beers either."
"Purchased a single small bottle at Whole Foods for $3.49. Poured into my Ommegang chalice. Dark color of faded ruby. Had a moderate sized head, but it faded rather quickly. Minimal lacing on the glass. Smell was very ripe with notes cherry and prunes, but also hot with booze. Taste was flavorful but unbalanced. Had a nice fruit flavor like figs and rye bread, but then it had a medicinal quality to it like cough syrup. Mouthfeel was very sticky, the body was thin, and the high abv was right up front. This beer does not feel good in your mouth. Does not remind me of other well-made dubbels I have had. Perhaps this beer could use a bit of age in the cellar to mellow out. But to drink one right now was not a great pleasure. Worth a try, but not worth buying again on my part."
"OK, now on to the beer. Dark brown color, odd colored brownish head, dissipates quickly. Man, the nose on this is quite funky, not in a good way. Definite whiff of soy sauce, not a good sign, and cardboard. Unfortunate. It really is an alright tasting beer, but if I catch that whiff before a sip it kind of ruins the whole thing for me. Sticky mouthfeel... Too bad - I really wanted to like this beer. I am a jazz musician myself and Thelonious Monk is one of my idols. Too bad the beer does not represent. Awesome label, great brewery (otherwise), yet a terrible beer. It's ok, it was worth the $9 to have the bottle on my shelf."
"Good flavour but not really Belgian in my book."
"Cheers..."
"That I could have indulged in a Bell's Expedition at about that price makes me very sad."
"Pleasant enough but not a stellar example of the dubbel style. I found the initial flavors excessively sweet and the finish to be a bit ""off""."
"Atmosphere is really solid here. Very strong, dark, and regal appearance. Nose is a nice balance of earthy and sweet components. Flavor is beautiful. Full and robust. Overall, this is a very good quaff."
"I think this beer might need a style change as it tastes and feels a lot more like a Belgian Style Strong Dark (as North Coast calls it). The beer reminded me of Unibroue's stronger, dark offerings. The malt is a bit syrupy with a mix of caramel and dried berries. Otherwise there's a bit of spice, but this beer needs a bit more complexity to stand up to the leaders in the style. Still, I think this could make a great beer to age for a couple years."
"Drinkability: This is a very good dubbel, and a very good representation of the style. Definitely a nice sipping beer, and definitely one I would like to drink again- certainly worth a try."
"Served from tap into a tulip. Pours a nice deep red-brown with a two finger off-white to light tan head that subsided to a minimal amount slowly. It maintained nice lacing throughout. The aroma was comprised of malt, fruit, and a subtle hint of alcohol. The flavor followed the nose with malt, fruit (mostly bananas), and a slight alcohol burn upon swallowing. It was light on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was not that bad. I really like the fruit flavor to it as it was not overpowering and made the brew quite smooth. I would definitely drink this one again for sure."
"Perhaps I have had way too many dubbels at this point and have spoiled myself with some great ones out of Belgium as well as from Unibroue, Allagash and Ommegang. This doesn't really measure up to those. However, it is the best Belgian style brew I've had from the West Coast."
"Overall impression: delicious, malty Belgian dubbel. The best American Belgian-style by far."
"D: Of all the beer I have tasted, which has not been that many, this is hands down the best! This will soon become a constantly stocked beer in my fridge. Highly recommend."
"Pairing: Mole Poblano deconstructed. I'm typically averse to ""un-making"" a classic dish like Mole Poblano, but the beer seemed to release each of it's classic mole flavors one at a time and I think it would be an interesting pairing (even if a lesser dish than a well-made mole) to feature the elements taken apart on the plate."
"Pours a reddish-brown that starts with a huge tan head. As the head settles down, has nice retention and lacing most of the way down. Smells of the Belgian yeast and sweet fruit. Taste is quite sweet, with minimal bitterness. Flavour has cherry and raisin, with lots of sugar. Good carbonation level. Just a bit too sweet for me, but overall a good beer."
"D: Not bad, not great... the iron-like taste kind of destroyed it for me."
"This is actually kind of a neat beer for me to have again. The first time that I tried it, as part of the beer flight at the NC taproom, it was one of the first craft beers that I had ever had. Truthfully I wasn't terribly fond of it. These many (well, ~5) years later my beer palate has changed to where I honestly think this is a really quality brew- and thats not just because it is corked and caged. This is a really good dubbel."
"D - I like this beer and I am glad I tried it, however one is probably enough for me."
"Pours a deep mahogany color with a frothy tan head that retains well for a high ABV beer, one of the better looking dubbels I've come across. The aroma has a lot of dark fruit upfront (notes of date, fig, raisin, and cherry), along with some candy sugar and molasses, toasted bread, yeast slightly floral hops and alcohol. The flavor also starts out with huge fruit notes (blackberry, cherry, raisin, date), along with some burnt bread, candy sugar, molasses, esters, yeastiness, flinty hops and alcohol. The mouthfeel is smooth and rich and drinkability is very good. An excellent dubbel, easily one of my favorites in the style (though it could really be considered more of a BDSA), it's flavorful, balanced and complex."
"Pours a clear, dark amber. 1/4 inch head of an off-white color. Slight retention and poor lacing. Smells of alcohol, sweet malt, slight dark citrus, and slight yeast. Fits the style of a Dubbel. Mouth feel is smooth and clean with an average carbonation level. Tastes of alcohol, sweet malt, yeast, hint of roasted malt, and slight dark citrus. Overall, poor appearance, but otherwise a good Dubbel."
"An alright Belgian-styled ale. A bit much alcohol and a tad too thin & sweet."
"T- As you would expect from the scent, it is a beer that will put hair on your ass. Thick malt alcohol taste. Definitely high quality. Sweet and fruity, it tip toes on port."
"D: Decent drink over all, but nothing special."
"Pours a dark red mahogany, head is fairly thin and dissipates quickly in a big chalice. Smells of toasted dark malts and alcohol. Taste is up front caramel and spice, cinnamony, the alcohol is quite evident and not well-integrated. Pleasant if heavy mouthfeel, drinkability, well, this is one that I'd order the same times that I'd order a glass of cognac--maybe after a nice meal on a cold winter's night. A decent beer but off for the style, this is practically like a light version of brandy."
"Drinkability is ok, tho not a great session beer. Good for a one beer evening, perhaps near the fire with a fine cigar."
"D: very tasty and drinkable dubbel thae wasn't as boozy as I thought it would be."
"jd"
"d - This brew is very unique, which usually means its not something you want to slam back in large quantities. Still, it has a good taste. A good brew for winter months."
"D: this dubbel is flavorful and well balanced. The alcohol stays pretty well hidden, with malt and roast in step. I could drink another with little difficulty, until the ABV catches up with me."
"Alcohol starts to hit you rather quickly, so I wouldn't suggest this for prolonged drinking. Accompanied by food, or savored like a brandy, and this is quite good."
"D--Cooler weather beer - goes down easy considering the ABV."
"Pours a reddish brown with a quickly dying head on top of an aroma that one would say is sticky caramel and a mild dose of dark chocolate. Also has some nutty yeastiness and hints of orange and citrus. A chewey medium body that is very bready and somewhat sticky with a sweet caramel base and hints of toffee along with some dry malts. Some hoppy fruit flavors and bit ofs orange, cherry, citric and spice but the malts slightly overpower and the taste is a bit off. A good ale but nothing spectacular."
"D: The beer is very easy to drink and the alcohol is well hidden."
"Another one of those constantly passed beers that I've always wanted to try. Finally! It pours a deep dark brown (borderline hazy), with a finger-and-a-half of ecru micro-foam on top, which quickly fades into nothingness. The nose comprises soap, bubblegum, raisins, banana, and pepper. The taste runs along somewhat similar, though darker, lines: notes of figs, raisins, cinnamon, sharp bitterness, cracked pepper, and light vinegar pervade the tongue. Something seems off...I can't put my finger on it, but the combination just leaves a bad taste in my mouth (literally). Well, not bad, but definitely not good either. The body is a surprising light medium, with light carbonation and a very fluid feel. Overall, I've gotta say that I'm pretty disappointed in this brew. I've had many that are worse, but this one was hyped-up a decent amount, and it just couldn't live up. If it weren't for that off-taste..."
"Drinkability: Hmmm... A monk's dream? Sure. Whatever. At least I supported jazz."
"M & D - Nice and delicious but with a bit of a watered down feel compared to other Dubbels."
"D: Strong and rich. Split a 12 oz. with my brother, and it was just enough to enjoy. Great beer, and really big for it's style. I probably wouldn't want a whole bottle for myself...but I could be convinced otherwise."
"D: above average for the style. Very little alcoholic burn on the way down, and not overly filling either."
"D: Good"
"d: not better from what i remember but different and more mellow; this beer has really grown on me"
"pours a dark mahogany color with little to no head with a small tan ring and just minimal lacing..sweet dark fruits,toffee and spice is what i smell..the taste is dark fruits like plum and prunes a little tartness and some sweet candied toffee/malt..alcohol is present low level of hops..mouth feell is full medium and coates the tongue with rich fruits and malts..this is a sweet strong dark dubbel with some candied malts dark fruits not much hop presence as it should be... its tasty good and gets better as it warms"
"Warm in the mouth. Easy to drink, so a dangerous beer. It is easy to drink but not watery... it's a complex beer. A good one too."
"Deep burgundy color with a moderate tan head. Fruity, but light smelling with some sweetness. Some yeasty scents as well. Sweet sugary taste with blackberry, bit also a fish sauce taste. Not sure what's going on, but I cannot get past the fishy taste. The flavor is just not working at all for me. Slickish feel with a dry finish. Minus the fish taste this would be an okay beer, but nothing to call home about. I would would like to give this a try again in the future to see if I just had an off pour."
"D: This beer needs a lot of time to open up. Best enjoyed, in my opinion, at room temperature or slightly colder. Carpe diem!"
"D: A nice sipping Belgian ""Dubbel"" - I thought it was a Quad before I looked it up on here. It drinks more like a Belgian Dark or a Quad IMO. Not as good as Rochefort 10 or St. Bernardus, but definitely cheaper and still pretty tasty."
"This beer is honestly not quite as good as I had remembered. It is rich, fruity, complex and delicious but I have tried many Belgian and Trappist beers since I had this last and it's quite difficult to compare to those. This one just didn't quite add up and is lacking some of the character that the genuine Belgians have."
"D: I thought the alcohol was well-hidden for 9.4% ABV. Nice beer to pair with a rich desert or on it's own as a nice sipping beer."
"D- Good! Depsite the taste not being up to the same level as the smell (which I found myself enjoying through each sip), I would enjoy this brew again."
"D- well there are a lot of dubbels out there and this one kinda misses the mark. Not bad but not great."
"This is really too sweet, I can't enjoy it even as dessert. Sorry!"
"Pours dark, just less than opaque, brown beer with less head then analogous Belgian imports. Dark cherries, chocolate, clove like spices, and Belgian yeast dark fruit esters fill the noes. Ahhh...No Chaser...Thelonious joke. Rich chocolate with just the right balance of bitter and sweet are the first big tastes. Mild phenols and a very slight flavor of ethanol spill into the finish, which fades all to quick leaving no real residual cloyingness. The mouthfeel is light and bubbly. Obviously some adjuncts are used to cut down on the body and/or bump up the abv. Great example of proper use of adjunct. Excellent drinkablity. A dangerous 9.5% abv beer. Watch out brother."
"D: A nice example of the style and one well worth seeking out."
"I must say there is something elusive in this beer as well, funky if you will. An improvisation on the tastebuds that's hard to determine where the next flavor chord comes from. An interpretation that's bold and yet recognizeable. Okay, that's my last jazz metaphor, this really is an enjoyable beer."
"Reviewed from my notes. The beer has a deep ruby color and is opaque. A huge tan head settled slowly but did not leave much lace behind. It does leave behind a film that is slow to recede. It has a slightly spiced plum aroma with a hint of sweetness. It reminds me of a dubbel. It isn't overly complex, but good. The flavor is very malty. I can taste caramel, plum, and toffee. There is a tart fruitiness in the finish and a mild chalkiness in the aftertaste. I'm unable to taste any of the alcohol. It has a medium body and a lot of carbonation. It leaves behind a full coating of my mouth. This feels like a big beer. There is some stickiness in my mouth but not on my lips. This beer is very drinkable. I'd like to keep a few bottles of this on hand. I wouldn't drink too many in any one sitting (due to the ABV), but it would be a good beer to have to share when friends visit. This is another great beer from North Coast."
"This beer is a dark dark brown with red hints that come out when held up to the light. It smells malty and sweet, maybe a bit fruity. The taste is surprisingly smooth for a 9.4% beer. As the beer warms, some of the fruity flavors that were present in the smell emerge along with a bit of the alcohol. Really good drinkability to this despite the high ABV. I bought this beer because i am a huge thelonious monk fan, and am really glad i did."
"Overall a fine Dubbel, and well worth seeking out."
"Drinkability: a very pleasnt Dubbel, I would buy again."
"The taste is overly sweet: there are tones of dark fruit like raisons and prunes but it's as if they were coated in a crazy amount of sugar. Kind of tastes like a fermented dr. pepper. There is also a very unpleasant metallic taste to the beer. The high carbonation makes the rough on my palate: it is not smooth. If you like Dubbels to have a huge amount of sweetness with no balance and if you like your beer to have the carbonation of soda you might like this. For me though, it was a drain pour."
"D- A really nice dubbel; nice sipping beer."
"Great beer...great musician."
"Taste is dark fruit with caramel malt. Plums and prunes are the most apparent; also some dark cherry. The finish is heavy caramel malt. Mouth feel was a little flat for me but overall a sweet beer. Quite drinkable and Belgian-like."
"A really great beer that I have really come to appreciate lately, happy its available all the time here in Sweden :)"
"Overall this is a solid beer, but I'd given what I've come to expect from North Coast I'm a little disappointed. I really enjoy the Old Rasputin Stout and I expected to be blown away. I'm pleased with Brother Thelonious, but not awed."
"It was easy to drink but not inspiring and I had high hopes. Over all it's a good beer but not great, I'd try it again but I'm not going to search it out any time soon."
"With the absense of a boatload of flavor and a kind of dead feel, Brother just hit the mark on being acceptable. This is good beer but it's not a game changer. I drank it with ease, there's no problems there, I was just left wanting more flavor and fruit and malt now that I think of it. This is good for a go andI think im going to try it again in the bigger version."
"D: This beer is perhaps perilously drinkable. It looks and hits harder than it tastes. Still, with fruit, coffee, and an excellent nose, I would drink this beer often. A little overcarbonated, but otherwise excellent."
"D - i like it, but can't love it....carbination is off, fruitiness is there but not overwhelming (or is it). alcohol is there, but hidden by sweetness."
"D: very nice Belgian style ale with an assertive and bold malt profile, lots of nice spicy and yeasty notes that meld well with the fruity esters"
"Overall it's a smooth drink; I found it to be adequately drinkable. That quick snap of the hop drop off was interesting, as a friend put it, ""its as though the drink hit you with a taste and then stood back to say, 'eh?'"""
"Another great brew by North Coast"
"Drinkability: pretty high, it's a good beer all around."
"D - nice knockoff but not great in any area."
"D- Goes down smooth and makes you want to go back just enough that it becomes a good beer to end the night with or finish a nice meal."
"Overall good attempt at the Belgium style. This review was short, and therefor not too in-depth. If I happen to buy this again, I will re-review."
"Drinkability: I had this with a meal (Swedish meatballs, mashed potatoes) and it went very well. I'm noticing some of the high ABV sneaking up on me towards the end so not something I have more than one of in an evening, but quite enjoyable overall. Solid good beer overall."
"This is better as a sipper, but rather lackluster for this style, and a let down because as nice as it looks and smells, ultimately the taste is what makes the beer."
"Overall, a nice Abbey-inspired offering. It lacks some of the depth of the Trappist examples, but is nonetheless a great beer with which to finish the evening."
"Overall I would say this is a good dessert beer. I drank this after having a cinnamon roll and it worked perfectly."
"Pours a solid head, with an initially thick but dissipating top. Dark in color, almost a chocolate amber color. Really only detect the amber if the light is shining on the glass. A nutty , almost malty, almost a slight hint of chocolate taste. Solid in the mouthfeel, substance without being heavy. Very drinkable considering the abv."
"D - a bit on the sweet side, could get cloying for some, alcohol is present and warming but this is a damn tasty beer"
"D: Very! typically dry finishing Belgian style has you going back for more."
"Velvety smooth medium carbonated and medium body. Good weight that accentuates the taste. Overall a complex and distinctive sipper that while tasty, is too rich/sweet to be highly drinkable."
"I poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a snifter. It pours honey brown with amber highlights. It has a strong aroma of sweet dark fruit. The taste follows the nose. Everything is in a nice balance, the high ABV is not noticeable. It is full/medium in body with moderate carbonation. A great sipper, I could sip on this all night."
"Pours a deep brown with a little bit of a head, which sticks for some nice lacing. Smell is mostly dark fruit--cherries and dates--with some caramel and malt sweetness. Taste is mostly dark fruit, residual sweetness, and some Belgian yeast. Very nice mouthfeel with good carbonation. Drinkability is very nice and smooth."
"Poured into a chalice with very little head present after pour. It has a deep brown color with a deep red tone when held up to the light. The smell is of dark fruits. The main thing I smell is cherry, but although I don't know what prunes smell like I imagine they smell like this beer. The taste has a definite fruit taste which encompasses the entire flavor. The sweetness is somewhat subdued. Overall a very clean taste, but just not up my alley."
"Drinkability: quite drinkable. Dubbels don't tend to be my favorite but Brother Thelonious is not bad. It's got a little more alcohol than most dubbels but it's still a highly quaffable beverage."
"I love dark beer. I try to buy one everytime I am at the local beer store. This beer really let me down. It had the smell of motor oil. It looked great. Dark beer with brownish head. But the taste was lame. It tasted almost as it smelled. It was like nothing I have had before. I had a hard time tasting the normal ingredients found in beer. It was more like a syrup. I will stay away from this. I am mad because North Coasts Old Rasputin is one of my favs on nitro. But this was a disappointment. IF you like abbey ales, try it but beware."
"D - This is dangerously drinkable at 9.4%."
"Overall - One of the best American examples of a Belgian style I've come across. This one is indeed worthy of your time."
"a wonderful sendoff beer hitting the dusty trail down to cali. year old thelonious. time to kick back, i know it's been a long day, but the dragon whale is ready to roll and this nectar has been aging for just this moment. you pop the top with a noisy motion and pour the heavenly brown liquid. follows the chocolate dipped blue cheese filled dates like magic, replicating some of those fine dark fruit flavors and aromas. its a sensual lover, massaging your feet if you ask. this is a damn smooth ride, the year has given this time to gel and drink magically, nothing indicative of 9%, just a slightly sweet deliciousness. i will sleep tonight peacefully, knowing that the road awaits."
"D - Decent. The flavor and aroma is quite good. I only have an issue with the carbonation and the very warm alcohol. 3.0"
"Poured from a 12 ounce bottle, the beer paurs with very little head that disappears to a thin line around the edges of the glass. Mahogany in color. There is little carbonation here. Smell is decent. Caramel and some some spice, with raisin and brown sugar. Hops are faint in the back. Taste is sweet and a bit cloying at first. That blows off though and reveals some toffee, nutmeg, cinnamon, and candied fruits. Hops dry out the finish, but ever so slightly. Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied, but is a bit much. The booziness is also a bit high, and a bit much for this style. It's a decent brew, but may need some age to come around."
"pours a dark reddish brown with no head into my snifter. smells surprisingly fruity for the style, almost weizenish. a little alcohol in the nose as well. taste is pretty plain, some dried fruit, and malt but mostly an overpowering sweetness. really too sweet, regardless of style. The alcohol in the smell doesn't come through in the flavor at which keeps the taste rating from falling too low. Mouthfeel is odd for this one. too much carbonation combined with the sweetness makes for a root beer like feel."
"Pleasant, but far from great."
"A medium body, bubbly and a somewhat creamy mouthfeel. A good beer, but rather plain and unspectacular mostly."
"Pretty tasty brew, nice character, nothing to wear down the senses. One I will certainly revisit."
"It's okay. I would say never age this though."
"Gets a bit better taste-wise but I'm still confused by the first impressions. Again, maybe I bought an off-bottle. I'll try it again some time but until then I can't really recommend this beer. I am disappoint."
"Notes: Great to have a brew named after Monk, and in its design and eccentric imagery resides quite a bit of its attractive. It makes for a good conversation, in particular good to hook up jazz lovers that are not too aware of the diversity of craft brews. Then the brew itself is good enough to provide an enjoyable drinking experience, albeit not too remarkable."
"Overall - Decent beer - may be better aged - I definitely enjoyed it and would drink again but would not search for it. Decent job North Coast, you guys brew some good beer."
"Nice job North Coast Brewing, once again."
"Drank out of a snifter and a tulip. I drank mine at 55 degrees and I think probably right at 50 would be better. It pours a huge frothy/fizzy lively white head. It has a sparkling body with a beautiful tawny ruby. Light flowers and bread on the nose the follows through to the palate. Also, I got a dark cherry towards the middle and end of the taste. Another good beer from north coast!"
"Coppery and mahogany colored. There is a touch of citrus to lighten up the 9.4%. Sweet and smooth. Heavy banana aromas coming off the creamy tan head. I think this is a great beer to enjoy slowly. Not a great choice on a hot day but a sure keeper. Wasn't expecting the sweetness of the brew to be so strong given the deep color."
"thelonious is a genius... so should ur brew drinking"
"Bottom Line: This is most certainly an above average dubbel, but not the best I have ever had. However, I would strongly reccomend this to anyone that enjoys Belgians as much as I do."
"Drinkability: Warming and sweet. Heavy hitting and sticky. This is beer is incredibly enjoyable. An excellent beer, because every sip is vibrant and full of taste."
"D- Enjoyed drinking this one. I could even have another if I had it. Go grab this one if you can. It's worth a go."
"D: Moderately sessionable. I just don't really love the nonexistent head and excessive carbonation."
"D: Extremely drinkable. True to its style..."
"D: A nice dubbel, I've had most Belgian dubbels before and this was not a bad alternative. The weak head and the rich carbonation holds back a higher grade."
"Overall, good brew. Drinkability is hindered by the 9.4%, and the richness gets to be a bit cloying. 750ml is too much, but I would be all over this if I ever saw it on tap."
"Pours a deep copper color with red highlights with no visible carbonation and virtually no head except a thin film. No lacing is present. The aroma is of deep caramel malt and some roasted malt. There are also smells of dark fruits. The taste is of caramel malt and deep roasted malt, there is a hint of dark fruits, but the main taste is the deep caramel malts. The mouthfeel is creamy with slight carbonation. Overall its a drinkable beer, you could have two or three no problem, having four or five might be pushing it."
"D: A pleasant, fruity dubbel from North Coast. Some minor things are a bit off (head and carbonation), but this is an enjoyable interpretation of a staple Belgian style."
"D - A delicious beer all around, though the sweetness would get a little overwhelming after the first one. A good sipper though."
"Drinkability: Happy new year, this is far from a crappy brew beer, the sheer nectar of the gods it might not quite be, but it's darn good, see! I've had me a few of this inebriating beverage on a number of occasions and it never seems to disappoint. I've said it once and I'll say it again: give it a go ya ho-ho-ho!"
"D - Drink 'em if you got 'em. Tonight, I sat around with the fam, had a Thelonius, watched 'Brazil', and had a real mellow time. Great evening beer."
"Jazz musicians sort of improvise and make it up as they go along; Belgian brewers do the opposite, they stick to time honoured yeasts and recipes and traditions. North Coast, a brewery way in the north of California, may have emulated the Trappists monks more than it has Thelonious Monk but it's done them both proud. Encore! Encore!"
"The taste is suggestive of fig and date sweetness, stewed prunes, touches of sour, dried cherry, blackberries. Alcohol is reasonably in check. Nice balance with a good finish that lingers, body a bit thinner than I expected from the array of flavours. Overall a decent although not outstanding example of the style in my book."
"a good double done by a very good brewery - I still prefer pranqster and old stock for their respective styles"
"D - Very drinkable, similar to Ommegang's Abbey Ale with a pleasant after taste. Thoroughly enjoyed."
"Loads of dark fruit. Maybe plum and cherries. Candy sweetness upfront then well balanced with some great malty goodness."
"Thanks midnite2sixman for being a chronicler of beer and a true patriot"
"Obviously a high ABV prevents an exceedingly high drinkability, but I still want more than one. This is a great beer from a brewery that's never let me down."
"D: Goes down easily, not very filling, definitely a beer that I would pick up again."
"Conclusion: Good stab at the Dubbel style by an American brewery; for the same price, I prefer Ommegang's Abbey for its slightly heavier malt and rum-raisin overtones"
"The taste is a bit of a letdown...that balanced complexity in the nose doesn't translate the same on the tongue. The malt profile still dominates, but it doesn't have the caramel flavor I was expecting. The spices are subdued which I am OK with. The dark fruits are in good harmony. Really, the malt profile is the only thing holding this back from true greatness. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with tons of effervescent carbonation but just a small sting. This is definitely a good dubbel, but already being from a handicapped style (to my palate) it takes something really special to stand out and I'm not sure that this is special."
"This was the sexiest beer I have ever poured, and I was not expecting it at all. Poured a brown with rubyred. The head was amazing. Nice towering ivory head that retained and laced throughout. Nice active carbonation. Great looking beer. Smelled malts, hops, barley, and dark fruits. Taste was capped off with good caramel malts, barley, and the dark fruits with some alcohol bite. Mouthfeel was nice and warming, good mouth coating. I will be buying more and drinking it more frequently."
"I'm sure I just got a bad bottle... the flavor is still there but it's just obviously gone flat. Unfortunate."
"Deep ruby-brown color, translucent with a nice compact head. I tasted more of a molasses taste in the malt profile than I remember. Very rich. I drank this the other night. Maybe I'll update this review after I have another bottle tonight."
"Bottle courtesy of HogtownHarry. Deep mahogany pour unleashed a beige foam that left minute lacing. Nose was bready, had pit fruits and tobacco with essences of yeast and caramel malts. Slightly smokey flavour profile was elevated with sweet molasses and caramel, tobacco and yeasty, bready crust like earthy flavours. Good beer. Thanks Harry!"
"In a goblet the beer was a red/orange color with a very tiny head. Wisps of lace. Brown sugar and dark fruit aroma. Taste followed form: brown sugar, dates, raisins, apple. A little yeasty. Medium bodied and smooth. A bit on the filling side; one was plenty for me."
"Drinkability: Definitely not the most drinkable in high quantities, but getting through this beer was not a chore at all."
"Drinkability: This is nicely drinkable as a beer for sipping, both because of the sweetness and because of the the ABV. Definitely a one a night beer. However, its also worth having again and seeking out if you have not tried it. I'm not sure, however, this should be categorized as a Dubbel rather than as a Belgian Strong Dark Ale."
"D - Not too shabby! Seems ot be missing some of the depth that I've seen in some other dubbels. Drinkable without a doubt, but not at the level of some of the Trappists, but for half the money I won't complain too much."
"Poured into chalice a hazy reddish brown that produces a nice creamy brownish mother of pearl colored head. As it settles it leaves a thin layer of foam that blankets the surface. Looks just like Chimay Premiere. This American Dubbel from North Coast smells of sweet dark fruit, alcohol and a bit of sweet malt. The fruits are the expected raisin and fig, with some brown sugar and vinous notes. The taste is an amplification of the smell, with certain elements becoming more prevalent, The raisin comes forth as well as molasses, with some sweet malt coming through towards the end and a hot alcoholic finish. This beer has a slick mouthfeel with some sweet malt chewiness. I think this is a very good Dubbel, American brewery North Coast did an awesome job on this Belgian style."
"Notes: Yep, another great beer from North Coast which I believe that I preferred on tap a while back. I recall that the on tap version (could it have been more fresh?) was more like candy in its malty goodness and I did not recall the bitterness or the burn of alcohol as much. This might be one of the great North American Belgian Dubbels out there (I'm looking in your general direction Unibroue!)."
"Coloring is a nice reddish brown, small head that lingers on for the duration of the glass. Smell was dark fruit and sugar, perhaps a bit of yeast. The beer itself was sweeter then I had expected, almost cloyingly so. While there were some delightful fruity flavors which popped out, the depth that I've come to expect from abbey ales wasn't present. The mouthfeel was quite thick, almost syrupy. The drinkability was certainly good, but I expected more from this beer overall."
"Slightly toasty caramel and dark fruit (cherries?) in the aroma. Similar flavors-- currants, black cherry, slightly burnt caramel. Fairly dry, slightly astringent. Alcohol comes through a little bit.`Mouthfeel is a tad thin and lacks the creaminess one expects. Finishes with a little musty yeast. Pretty decent but something was missing for me, possibly a bit more yeasty complexity and/or creamy texture."
"D-- Interesting Dubbel. Not my style though. Was way too syrupy/ sugary for me. ABV at 9.4 is not a big deal but could use a bit less carmel, sugar and carbonation. Take your time and sip this."
"Drinkability - Great beer!"
"Drinkability is decent. I found this beer easy to get into while still being enjoyable."
"It's fitting that it's named for a jazz legend, as ""smooth, yet complex"" describes it to a T. What I get from one bottle feels almost like I'm cheating somebody, definitely picking up more."
"Overall this is a well-crafted American Dubbel that captures many of the finer points contained in its Belgian style. Recommended."
"D: This is a nice dubbel overall. My sample was only a year old and felt like it would benefit from a little time in the cellar. A nice nightcap beer."
"D: A decent abbey ale from an American brewery. I would not rank it as my favorite though. It is worth trying but I would say it is too strong to be a session ale."
"Drinkablity: I have enjoyed this beer from a large format bottle a couple times to great extent so this draft experience was over all a let down."
"-Bye"
"I do highly recommend this beer, in addition to other North Coast brews. I'm happy to say that they've delivered another hit!"
"EDIT: Now I see the style is a dubbel, but I am really not seeing how this beer can be a double. I have had a few quads and dubbels and this tastes way more like a quad than a dubbel."
"Taste is quite complex. Lots of shit going on here, very typical of a belgian beer. Again this is surprising that this is an American beer. I think it's quite good, and theres not telling it was quite so strong."
"D: The thinner than expected body helps to make this sessionable, but then again the sourness detracts from it."
"They call it a strong dark which makes me think of quad. As a double this is actully much better. it doesn't have enough character to be a quad. In general and ok beer. Very dark color, a little sweet, good carbonation and not to hot alcohol-wise. Get it if you see it."
"12 OZ bottle . Slightly cloudy dark brown ale, with a huge tight,bubbles light brown head. Nice deep roasty,smoky,malty aromas with nice spice showing through..almost reminds me of a Belgian themed Scotch ale. Very malty ,slightly dry flavours, soke too, then dark fruits, spices,coriander,black pepper, demerara sugar, raw, unrefined. Thick,full delicious creamy mouthfeel to this beauty. A vertiable meal in a bottle here. Lovelly beer..I stick to my original view this is like a good Scotch Ale done with belgian yeasts. Very nice."
"This is not a beer to be trifled with. Heavy, sweet body with 9.4% is not a quick drinker - a hefty sipper. Flavors are rich and deep (though not overly complex), though they seem to stand out individually without blending overly harmoniously. I dig the slight funk and sour cherry but overall too sweet for my liking. It's a nice big brew, but certainly not the best in style."
"Feels super slick and creamy with a full body. Drinkability was meh for the style."
"D: Too drinkable."
"Another solid beer in the NC lineup."
"This is very drinkable."
"D: Hides the 9% well. One of the better dubbels I can remember having. Another great beer from North Coast."
"Taste is sweet and grainy biscuit with brown sugar. High alcohol warming with a bready yeast and rich ripe alcohol. Woody oak in here too. Mouthfeel is very full. It's a slow drinker, and improves as it warms up a bit."
"This was a pleasure to drink, Very enjoyable. The sweetness does tend to build as you drink but stops short of being unbearable. Over all an extremely enjoyable beer."
"The drinkability was not great. Lots of alcohol showing through the flavours... a good beer to taste and try, but probably not going to be a go-to brew."
"D- Even in a category that lends itself to sippers, this was a bit much. I didn't find the alcohol to be well hidden and it just came off as a bit too aggressive. I somehow prefer the peripheral qualities (appearance and smell) to the more meaningful characteristics (taste and drinkability). Glad I tried it, but I'm not going to seek it out again."
"Good drinkability, a solid dubbel overall."
"It's a pretty good dubbel, though the alcohol is washing against the top of the levees. Still....cool bottle label!"
"Overall, very pleasant and drinkable for its strength, but this one is a definite sipper, preferably on a cool night with some cool jazz(Thelonious Monk, anyone?)"
"Brother Thelonious. Apparently a purchase of this beer benefits a Jazz organization out in California, good to know. This was a standard fair, American made Belgian style ale. It was darker than I expected but it turned out to be about a strong brown ale. The mouthfeel was sweet and full. Dark brown, almost no head or carbonation but you wouldn't especially expect a beer like this to have either of those. Nearly 9% ABV and this was a big bottle, it packed a wallop. It wasn't the easiest beer to drink. The sweetness of the malt and the sweetness of the high alcohol were not as balanced as I would have liked. There is definetly a market for this beer though, it just may not be me. I have seen this beer (and maybe you have too) and have been curious for a while. I am glad I drank one and it is a good beer for me to start out my new journey on. If you like brown ales or porters and are looking for a serious one, or if you are into Belgian style ales (especially dark ales), you should check this out."
"Overall: Something about this beer just didn't do it for me. It's a fair example of the style, though a bit simple. I'd much prefer an Ommegang Abbey to this. Likely won't be purchasing again."
"Medium bodied and goes down smooth. Not quite as satisfying as a true Belgian, but still has its place. Simply by virtue of there being better takes on this style out there, this isn't something I'll likely be coming back to very often...but still I'd be lying if I said I didn't enjoy it."
"D - A tad too sweet for my taste to make it a session beer but a very nice beer."
"The body is full and smooth, coating the tongue nicely. Smooth also describes the drinkability of this tasty treat. A very nice example of the style, worth seeking out."
"taste is strong, smooth, and thick, bakers chocolate, prunes, raisins, grapes, some toffee, background is white pepper, malt, and spice, ends dry, somewhat tart, and somewhat sweet sweet."
"Not thick but a decent degree of chewiness nevertheless. Carbonation is held in check nicely and the finish is almost creamy. Highly drinkable for a dubbel and one I'll have to keep in mind alongside the Chimay Red and Ommegang Abbey for future fixes."
"Overall- A good effort in recreating the Belgian dubbel."
"Hearty, has depth and character. Great brew."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, strong kick, good representation of style, this might not be the best Belgian-style beer I've had but it's a solid beer overall that is worth drinking for a while."
"Drinkability - Starts great with flavor, finish is average and a bit boozy."
"Normally, I do not drink black beer. But, this beer is not what I would consider normal. It pours a dark beer with little head. The smell it good. A rather fresh smell to a beer I thought would smell bitter. I does not taste bitter either. Has a slight after taste, but nothing a true beer drinker would be upset about. It taste like there is a bitter and a sweet taste are competing for dominance in the beer and it is ruled a tie. For someone that does not usually drink black beer, its pretty good. I guess I could not either recommend or not recommend this beer. One of those things one would have to judge for themselves."
"Overall drinkibility is good. I would much rather have sipped this on a cold winter night, rather than a warm spring/summer evening, but that's my own doing. Like a decadent piece of dark chocolate cake, one is enough for me. Definitely a sipper, but definitely worth picking up."
"D- A bit boozy, but tasty. A good sipper."
"Sweet fruity finish that is not unpleasant but a bit of a ""soda pop"" character all around; perhaps too much of a cherry character; may not be all that food friendly. Just my opinion, as always."
"This beer poured a beautiful ruby red with a small head. The smell is some dark fruitness of some raisins and maybe plums. The taste starts off with some malt that gives way to a lot of different fruits including banana and plums that give away to a little alcohol heat on the back end. The mouthfeel is slightly thick with some pleasant warming from the alcohol. You can tell that there's some punch behind this beer, but it doesn't really hurt the drinkability that much. I'm glad I finally got around to trying it out."
"This was an interesting beer. Frankly, not the best. Didn't have good body or enough complex flavor. That sweet raisin taste just won't go away. Even stuck around to mess up the BCS I had afterward."
"A big beer - the alcohol is there, the beer is rich, sweet and deep. A few at a time, no more - but do not get me wrong - a fantastic beer"
"Overall, its quite good. Comparable to Ommengang Abbey Ale in my opinion. A little pricier though."
"Pours a medium brown that is almost amber, standard tan head, decent lacing left. Smell is nice rich candi sugar, raisiiny fruit. Taste is much of the same. Sweet belgian sugars, a bit of hearty yeastiness, and a deep dark-fruit raisiny-ness. It's a lot heartier than most of the other dubbel's I've tried, it is almost what you see from Strong Dark Ales in terms of substance. Bold belgian flavours, buoyed by just the right levels of carbonation and stickiness. Drinks absolutely exceptionally and easily, to the point of being dangerously so. Despite the short reviews, this is probably the best American dubbel's I've experienced so far, and it definitely holds its own with the Belgians."
"anyways,i also love the name and label of this beer."
"Drinkability: A truly classic example of the style. Rich and complex; displays incredible depth. I wish it were more easily available."
"One of the cooler labels I have seen in awhile. The beer is a Dubbel that is pretty in your face with the dark fruits and yeastiness. A couple years in the cellar might tame the upfront notes but really this is very good US dubbel. The beer is quite drinkable though slightly sweet and the big mouthfeel is part of its over the top charm. I will buy again and put in the cellar for future tastings"
"North Coast is one of my favorite breweries and this is one of their better beers."
"the sum > the parts. highly lovable as a whole, even if the individual aspects may be slightly less than perfect."
"D- It's tasty that for sure. Far from boring, too, but just a little too thin for me. And damn! Watch out for the ABV (9.4%)! Sneaky bastard. I'm glad I'm at the end of this review because 3/4 of the way through the bottle and I'm feeling quite buzzed. I do feel this is a very decent American attempt at a Belgium Abbey. I would not go out of my way to pick one of up again but wouldn't say no if offered a glass at a tasting, or something."
"D: It is easy to polish off a 12 oz. bottle. However, watch out for that high alcohol content. It can sneak up pretty quickly. It is interesting enough that I would drink it again, but I am not sure I would want two in the same night."
"D: Drinks fairly easily, but the ABV and sweetness mean I wouldn't want to go through too much at a time."
"A very nice beer to sip on a cool night. Tasty, though its strength and rich sweetness will keep me to one a night."
"Cool label, with Brother T enjoying what looks like a quad on the label. The namesake brew pours a bit lighter and redder and with slightly less head, even at cellar temperature. Another Belgian style that has been lingering in my cellar for awhile. Glad I cracked it open, and I'll probably pick up another at some point, although there are others of the style that I'd probably go for first. Pretty decent beer overall though."
"The beer poured a dark amber with an off white head. The aroma was of malt and raisins. The taste was of sweet malt mixed with raisins, and some medicinal undertones. The feel was heavy and wet. This was a very nice beer on a cold winters evening. Just what I'm normally looking for in a dubbel."
"a very smooth and delicious beer. the malt body is medium body yet not overpowering or too sugary and very smooth for the alcohol. very enjoyable to drink"
"Notes: not too familiar with abbeys yet, but if they are anything liek this ill be happy. very flavorful and unique. i like NC. delicious."
"Overall, a very nice beer. Unfortunately for me it doesn't stand out really enough to warrant me buying more.. I like a little more hazelnut or cherry in this style and this just seems a little neutral... I think maybe buying the 750 would help entice me to have more. But Three Philosophers beats this hands down."
"It is a very good impression of a Belgian Style Abbey Ale, but the yeast funk had slight metallic taste (like a fishing lure) towards the end of each sip which was strong. Glad to read other reviewers experienced the strange slight metallic taste, but overall this was a very good and well balanced strong beer that has a nice kick to it."
"Overall: If I had to describe this beer in one word it would be unique. A bomber is just too much for one setting. I'd much rather have shared this one and had something else to sample in an evening. North Coast make some really good beers; their Old Rasputin is tops. This one, though, is just okay for me dog (Randy Jackson reference)."
"D: Drinkablity is pretty good, you don't notice the alcohol so much in the taste but it is a nice warming beer that goes down maybe a bit too easy. Would try this again for sure."
"Drinkability: Moderate; great flavors are present, but the sweetness of the dark fruit is going to take some getting used to on my part; also, it's a little sneaky how that alcohol creeps up on you. Pretty solid overall though and great gateway into what I hope will become a potential favorite style."
"Drinkability is quite easy - esp given the ABV. Worth a try in my book!"
"pours a very dark brown almost black with about a finger and a half worth of dark brown head. i liked the bottle alot more after i read the side and found out that the picture was of thelonious monk and that they give a percent of the beer sales to the thelonious monk institute of jazz. the smell was fine but had no obvious distinct characteristics. taste and mouthfeel can only be described as an enjoyable thick. this was my second time to have the brother thelonious and i will definately be getting it again. also my bottle says the abv is 9.4"
"D: Not too bad of a beer overall. It's a little different from the typical abbey style ale I'm used to, and that's not a bad thing. Would recommend."
"Enjoyed a pint on tap in Fort Bragg just down the street from the brewery. This beer is great no matter where it is enjoyed."
"Overall, I think this is a reasonably decent beer. There is room for improvement but worth trying. It is a bit sweet for my palate, given the level of thickness and does not quite have the balance I would like with bitterness."
"i poured this mahogany-red dubbel brew into a room-temperature chimay goblet. it poured nice and heady...with the 3/4 inch-thick head fizzilating away into a wispy, lacy residue. first smells are of dark fruit, with a sweet and crisp dryness to it. i'm also detecting the alcohol. mouthfeel, well, its just a whisker thinner than i expected, though not in a bad way, with notable carbonation and hops and the alcohol mingling nicely. the tastes on the palate are sweet, fruity and maybe caramel because there is a buttery sweet quality present, tempered with bitterness and alcohol. reminded me very much of a unibroue's maudite offering. the finish however was very nice and clean, inviting another sip. i drank the whole bottle, a 750 ml undertaking, in one enjoyable sitting. quite drinkable for its 9.4 ABV...a fine take on the abbey style ale, all the classic characteristics are there."
"-Dotson"
"Definitely a sipper. This is good, but I'm not so sure it's really special."
"Very pricey four pack. Beer pours dark brown with two finger head. Very nice taste with strong characteristic Belgian after taste. the mouthfeel is almost like a cream ale with no alcohol burn, even with the high abv. A very good beer, but at eleven dollars a four pack it is a little to steep to make a regular selection."
"Not too bad of a beer. For a take on the Dubbel style it is not bad. The nice carbonation makes the sweetness level more palatable."
"A great dubbel, I enjoyed this immensely."
"Overall a good brew. A little bit sweeter than I would like, but it was still enjoyable."
"Although I could not visualize the sediment the buttery feel and taste probably suggest the sediment was liquified. Very good beer."
"This is a very good dubbel. Bought a 12 oz. single for $3.79 and it was worth it and then some. This is not what you'd call a session beer, and the alcohol, while warming, makes this a sipper. I could have one a day, but that's about it. If you like Belgians, you have to try this one."
"D - Pretty decent. This is a solid beer... worth trying if you come across it on tap."
"I bought this in a four pack, as well as a four of their Imperial stout and a large bottle of their Saison-- at the Calgary Co-op liquor store in Forest Lawn. Apparently it's exclusive to Co-op stores, who are doing a nice job of finding and keeping good beer around these days."
"Pours a dark brown color, some head but diminishing. Light tannish head, fine bubbles. Strong Belgian alcoholy aroma, dark fruit, sweet smelling. Some earthy smells. Clean, not too strong a taste surprisingly. Malty sweet with clean finish. Not alcoholy taste. A little tempered on the taste, though. Sweet tasting. Malty aftertaste. Good."
"D - Very, I give this beer all 4's pretty damn good and I'd drink it again."
"Taste is malty but in a simple way, not a lot of depth. Sweet and a bit chewy but no notable flavors linger after the swallow. Again improving with warming. Light in carbonation and assumably not bottle conditioned given the clarity. Decent feel and drink but overall not very impressed, yet compares favorably to many of the style and hides its strength well. Noted as a Belgian Strong Dark Ale on their website. ABV of 9.4%."
"On tap at The Red in Santa Cruz. Pours a clear deep reddish amber color with a beige head that leaves some decent lacing. Aroma is peppery alcohol, red and dark fruits, and a hint of mesquite. Light and fruity with not enough body or depth for the style. Astringent and thinnish. A textbook example of a poor American imitation of a Belgian beer."
"I recommend picking one up if you can find it."
"Overall a pretty good Belgian Ale. I'd recommend it, but for the price, there are better."
"D: I wouldn't mind having it again, but its carbonation is a bit of an issue. Goes well with spicy food."
"D- Good"
"I did not care much for this beer. The second half of the beer I enjoyed much morel. Drinking the beer with my meal, the spicyness of the garlic from the garlic fries served to balance out the sweetness of the BT. Pretty good with spicy food, not so good alone."
"D- A tasty beverage, but this is just not everything I had hoped. A good American take on a seldom seen Belgian style."
"Overall I liked this beer. It's different than any dubbel I've had before - though I'm beginning to notice that dubbels are quite diverse. Certainly not may favorite (love Ommegang's Abbey), but it's different and one I wouldn't turn down."
"D) High, considering"
"J"
"Light brown and mahogany hues with an off-white head that dissipates quickly with minimal lacing. Sweet, malty aromas with mostly toffee and caramel notes. Tastes of toffee, coffee, and oatmeal with the smallest trace of alcohol. A medium body of a slightly syrupy consistency makes sure the flavors stick to the palate for a while. This pleasurable, malty brew is very easy and fun to drink. I'd only have one, but I can see how the drinkability would make it easy to keep going!"
"Brother Thelonious pours a medium, cloudy brown-tea-like color with a one-finger beige head. Lots of lacing. Smell is strong of molasses, honey, raisins, and maybe Syrah. The taste is strong of dried fruits, roasted malts, spices, & the alcohol is rather apparent. Mouthfeel is acidic, thick. Overall, a drinkable beer, however, the alcohol is quite prevalent (9.4 percent ABV)."
"D: A decent stab at a dubbel but there are both Belgian (St. Bernardus) and American (Ommegang) versions with greater depth and better feel."
"4.0 D: Only second beer of this style and I think I could get used to drinking a lot more."
"Sampled on-tap at the Elephant Room in Austin. Poured a very deep red from the pitcher with a full two fingers of thick head. I came away mainly with aromas of dark fruit and toasty bread; nothing extraordinary. I found Brother Thelonious tasty, but not overly complex, though I may have drank my pint a bit cold (frosted glasses--seriously???). Most clearly present was the same sweet fruit, particularly cherry and raisin, as in the smell, with some maltiness. The stickiness and dry finish of the beer also brought to mind licorice flavors. The 9% ABV was nowhere to be found in the taste, though its strength made a pint and a half more than enough for me. A solid Belgian offering, in any case."
"Good flavor, it diminishes quickly, but the initial bite on the tongue is nice and smooth. It does have a bit more bitterness/ hoppy taste than expected, and not as rich as some other dubbels I've drank, but definitely solid. I probably started drinking this a little too cold because the richness comes out a bit more as a swish it around in my mouth a bit. Another nice beer by the North Coast, but I wouldn't offer it their flagship tag."
"Overall, I recommend this beer if you are looking for something malty, full-bodied, and strong. Personally though, I won't be bending over backwards to try this particular style (if they all are like this, anyway) in the very immediate future."
"I love this style and this certainly is true to style."
"A Belgian style dubbel at 9.4% ABV? Gimme some of that! Poured into a Westmalle chalice, dark red, nearly brown, cloudy, no head, no lacing. Very sweet aroma up front. I immediately thought of bubblegum upon the first smell. As I delve further into the nose, I'm picking some brown sugar, dark fruits and raisins with just a hint of sourness in the background. Nice and complex. Taste is also sweet upfront - a candy sweetness -hints of licorice, rum soaked raisins, and the bubblegum that came through on the nose also makes it's way to the tongue. Body is medium and the high ABV is well hidden, but becomes slightly more pronounced as it warms. I can't believe this is 9.4%! Very smooth and easy to drink. Tasty stuff, here."
"Drinkability: Highly drinkable, nothing overly impressive or overwhelming...but extremely easy drinking and smooth. A solid beer that supports a good cause, I look forward to drinking this beer again."
"A straight forward dubbel with big flavour, and although a bit rough around the edges, it delivers goodness. I'd pick up more. A fine homage to Thelonious Monk as well."
"Overall - Pleasant but nothing special."
"D - Tasty, strong, maybe a tad too sweet for some."
"Did not live up to expectations. Mahogany pour with a bubbly off-white head. Solid aroma or malts, alcohol, and smoke. The peat, yeast, caramel, and nutty flavors are good, but really washed out. This came so close to greatness. Instead, good, but not memorable."
"This poured an opaque mahogany with tan head. It smelled like earthy wheat with some wild honey and caramel malt and wild yeast, with a bit of lemon hops and alcohol. It tasted like earthy barley and brown malts, with some lemon hops and wild yeast, and a bit of oak and alcohol. It gained a much more prominent creamy caramel malt flavor as it warmed. It was somewhat thick with some carbonation, and had a lasting bittersweet aftertaste. Overall this didn't have the best flavor cold, but it becomes great as it warms. It had good body, and a clean character that hid the alcohol decently. This is enjoyable fresh, but I could see it improving even more with age. The best feature is the more subtle yeast, as compared with the overpowering wild yeast most Belgian ales have."
"750 mL bottle. Brownish amber pour with a medium tan head. Aroma of caramel and raisins. Nice lacing, even taste of raisins, caramel, bread and malt. Aftertaste has a nice warming alcohol flavoring but not too much that gets in the way of an even finish."
"D: Excellent beverage. Not quite a dubbel. I think works better as a Belgian Specialty Ale such as Artisanal Amber or brown."
"Pours a dark, cloudy brown color with a thick foamy beige head. Nice aroma of chocolate, raisin, plum, cinnamon, brown sugar and spice. Flavor: Chocolate, dark fruit, toffee, roasted malts, caramel with slight bitter finish."
"M/D: A bit over-carbonated for this style for me. But the texture was lighter than I expected. ABV makes it kinda hard for me to give it a higher rating here because the alcohol was so evident."
"Other comments: A decent ""Belgo-American"" beer, though there is something vaguely missing in the background. Something to round it out a bit more, but I can't really put my finger on it."
"It was enjoyable."
"3.8/5"
"An elegant and well crafted dubbel. Lots of alcohol, still almost gulpable."
"D: Very good drinkability, very smooth and solid in most aspects (nose, flavor, mouthful)."
"Very good!"
"serving style: bottle"
"Quite filling and nice mouthfeel. A very nice sipper, for sure. Maybe not extremely drinkable, but I think the alcohol is well hidden."
"- ajh"
"A bit murky, tawny brown in colour with a thin beige cap when poured into a chalice. A little bit of stickage and the head settled into a collar with a clump of bubbles floating in the middle of the glass. When the cork popped there was a flash of bready yeast and wine in the aroma. Once in the glass it was a little less yeasty, but still very vinous. Plenty of toffee too, plus some plum and raisin notes. Pretty much the same in the flavour. There was a bitter edge that became more pronounced in the finish along with some alcohol flavour and warmth. Quite fruity overall. Light spice in the finish. Medium bodied with moderate carbonation, decent texture, slightly dry in the finish. Not a bad drinker for the abv, but a fairly mediocre dubbel."
"got this on tap at my local beer bar served in a 12oz tulip. appearence darkbrown with a mocha thick head, i did enjoy the aroma smelled a little of carmel and spice. Taste and mouth feel better then i expected for a belgian copy dubble. over all i would order this beer again and actually bought a bomber of this at a beer store for future drink."
"All and all, a good beer. I think a couple of years in the beer-cellar might round this one of and make it a wonderful beer."
"The aftertaste is long and surprisingly sweet with lots of dried fruits and a nice malty finish."
"Pours deep coffeelike amber with a decent head, but with no lacing. The smell is roasted, with a soysauce like character - much like a dry porter. The flavor is roasty, cherrylike, with a little woodiness on the back end. There is a nice burn of malt spiciness down the throat. The mouthfeel is medium, with a little woody cling on the back of the mouth and a nice sting of carbonation. Not bad, probably be better with food."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- The texture here is simply put, perfect. Slick and frothy going in, it remains impeccably sublime through the swallow. Considering the richness in flavor here, this mouthfeel couldn't possibly be better. This is a big beer, one best savored with a hearty meat or cheese dish. Well worth the money spent."
"D - Not bad, but I think a couple would be enough as the flavor is not a full as I would like it for having a higher alcohol content."
"Very nice foamy head, ambitious bubbles here and there, and head lasted a nice bit. Pretty amber-brown cloudy color. Aroma perfectly matched the taste: whiff of nuttiness (macademia? pecan? yes, pecan) up front then move to creamy caramel and baked, slightly burnt figs. Carbonation very nice: pleasant fizziness that lasted throughout the whole beer tasting. This beer is remarkable. After tasting this and moving to the Bernardus Abt 12, the Bernardus tasted very (though pleasantly) apple cidery. A palate cleanser after the Thelonious."
"Pours brown with ruby highlights. About a half inch of head on the pour, but it is quickly gone afterwards. Smell is very nice. Very plump, juicy dark fruit. Some ripe dark grapes, plum. There is a lot of yeast flavor in the first sip. Dominates most of the promising notes that are in the smell. Good amount of carbonation and lively bite in the mouthfeel. Easy drinking, but unfortunately more complex in the nose than in the taste."
"And the label is pretty cool too."
"Close but no cigar."
"Edit: Tried it again on tap at North Coast's taproom. The flavor was much better and lacked any of the bizarre soy sauce notes from my first review. There's complexity in the taste with a lot of fruit and a well-balanced sweetness."
"The tastes are on the faint side with a tart acidy friutiness,bitter raisins,dusty chocolate nice balance with a drying bitterness thats very tart leaves some chocolate notes lingering. Efferecent feel,the body has a light feel,has some smoothness with not much of an alcohol presence. Goes down nicely with a slight touch of heat."
"I'd consider having some more of this. I thought it was surprisingly drinkable for a dubbel."
"Nice dark brown color with lots of tannish white head. A sweet caramel smell with noticeable cherry grape and raisin. Taste is more of the same. Lots of alcohol present. Lots of carbonation. Aftertaste not as pleasant. A slow sipping beer but enjoyable."
"The taste, though, fails to live up to the look and smell. It is light, zesty, and tart, with bittersweet fruit, tart cranberry juice, cirus, hint of burnt caramel and alcohol, with brief initial promise and complexity. This promptly degrades, however, into complete blandness with merely overly strong, persistent tartness being the main quality, with only very weak hints of cranberry and burnt dried fruit. It rapidly becomes tiresome and boring, the tartness which at first seemed like a nice quality utterly dminates the drink, leaving almost no other taste or character. What compelxity it started out with vanishes and I see no point in drinking this."
"Mouthfeel is on the heavier side of medium and does a great job imitating the Belgian greats. Large alcohol volume, but mostly absent in the taste and smell. Very drinkable. Underrated brew from an underrated brewery. I should stock this more often. Plan to pair it with steak later this evening."
"I couldn't ask for better results from aging this beer. It makes me wonder what would happen if I bought a case and had one every year until I'm 40. Yikes, that's a scary thought!"
"D: Not the best of the style, but tasteful none the less. A good American take. Not sessionable, 1-2 and I'd be set."
"A drinkable beer. I like it, but I think this is a beer for sipping slowly throughout an evening. The mouthfeel is just too thick for me to fully enjoy this beer."
"Poured into Chimay chalice. Pours mahogany brown but when held to some lighyt there are brilliant ruby highlights. Thick off-white head with good retention and lacing. Smell is off raisin and other dark fruits, perhaps some dark tart cherries with a little alcohol and sweetness. Taste is on par with smell. A Belgian candi sugar malt backing with some dark fruits and bit of earthiness, if thats a word, to it. Mouthfeel was a little thicker than expected. Overall not bad, the high ABV is well hidden and it was a nice slow sipper."
"This is a very good representation and I enjoyed it enough to make it one of my picks at the Andersons."
"Enjoy this one without food - but if you must perhaps a soft goatsmilk cheese and water crackers. PROST!"
"Nice, thick mouthfeel. Pretty decent beer, but I'd rather stick to real Belgians."
"this is one the beer closest to a belgian from us of a that I've ever encountered. Bravo! Big foamy frothy textured head and plenty of lace. Soft texture, slightly perfumey. Clear dark rich amber with red highlights. Not too sweet. Great balance. Almost a session considering what it is."
"Pours a cloudy dark amber with a minimal head that dissipates quickly. Aroma is dark fruits, some Belgian inspired spice and a bit of sweetness. Smells like its going to be a sweet beer. Tastes of sweet dried fruits, a bit of pepper, and a touch of alcohol especially as it warms. Full body, sweet sticky mouthfeel, and a bunch of carbonation. Could use some more yeast character imho. Decent brew, not the best dubbel I've ever had, but nice to drink just the same."
"On the whole, definitely quality stuff, well done, and flavorful. A better mouthfeel from more effervescence would do wonders for BT, already a fine representative of the style."
"D. Very pleasant all through and a fine meal beer."
"D: A very nice dubbel, I could not have had more than 2 in one sitting."
"Superb feel and drinkability. This is a very nice dubbel I'll be sure to buy again. A quote I liked from the label, ""Carpe diem vita brevis""!"
"More like a fine wine than a beer. Still one of my favorites."
"D - This is an excellent North Coast beer. It belongs up there with Old Rasputin and Praqster."
"The appearance of the beer took me forever to get to because the cork on the 750ml bottle was of such poor quality and impossible to get off. It ended up in pieces twenty minutes later! The good news is that once I was able to do so, (extremely frustrated by now) I was surprised at the appearance. Dark, black and ruby color with a decent sized head that leaves copious lacing around my Duvel glass. The taste was pretty good, considering I consider Dubbels and darker styles of beers to be less appealing to my palate in comparision to tripels and pale ales. Overall, an above average dubbel. Next time, Ill look for it in either a four pack or on tap. Nothing is more frustrating that to NOT be able to open a beer."
"I chose a Chimay vessel to pour this beautiful ruby red delight. Poured a thin tanish head that did not linger very long. The smell was the familiar bread, yeast, biscuit, up front. The taste is oh so good, some malts with the combination of some candy apple type flavor, mixed in with the slight hint of banana. The mouth feel is full, with a lot of fizz-to-the-tongue. I will be purchasing this quality brew again for sure, in the very near future!"
"750ml bottle: First off, I love the name. It is a great play on words. This one pours an opaque reddish-brown color. Mine had a large, fizzy tan head on it that went away almost immediately. It has a very nice aroma. Somewhat candy sweetness, along with cherries, plums and yeast. A touch of effervescence on the tongue. The taste is quite good also. The taste is good. Somewhat sweet, caramel, raisins and dark cherries to the taste. Finishes a bit lighter than expected. I would definitely buy another."
"Delicious, North coast took several steps in the upward direction (as if they needed it) imo. Will look forward to having again for sure."
"D. A sipper for sure. Good to let it warm up and mellow out. The complexities come out more."
"D-Probably won't try this one again."
"Very drinkable for a dubbel. The alcohol is well hidden so you barely notice it. It's flavorful and worth the effort to try. I would recommend it if you enjoy the dubbel style."
"Aroma is very enticing, more fruity than malty; I get hints of both apple and banana, as well as a touch of yeast. It pours a rich, clear, dark chocolaty brown with a thick beige head that persists. Flavor is fruity with some malt and a fair amount of hop bitterness, as well as a hint of burnt caramel. Texture is smooth and lively, and this dubbel goes down very pleasantly. This is a brew for sipping slowly and appreciating."
"Drinkability - I wanted another right away just for the mouthfeel followed by the taste. Very enjoyable beer. I wish I bought more than one at the packie!"
"Despite a few stylistic flaws and in spite of a 9.4% ABV, this is one heck of a beer. Malt complexity is rich and varied. A little too bitter for a Dubbel. Slight increase to the ester complexity would help too. In spite of this, I'd easily drink a few pints - it's that good."
"a little expensive at 16.95 a four pack but a good beer to sip and enjoy with friends at a holiday or special time."
"Pours into my Brother Thelonious goblet a deep, dark mahogany color with a mildly disappointing head. The color of the head is great but it is not full and sticky like those of the the Belgian beers. The aroma is wonderful: candy, brown sugar, malt, cherries, lots of biscuit, and maybe a little banana. The taste is also splendid but the flavors are more central: brown sugar, dark sugary dough - lots of dark sugary bread-type qualities, actually - malt, dark fruit, bananas, a little oak, candy, spices, and alcohol, which tends to add a little spice itself. Also, I feel like there is a little bit of a tobacco character, but in a good way...kinda weird...but good. It has a full body, but I wish it were a little heavier in the mouth. Either way, North Coast has hit a home run again with Brother Thelonious. Make sure you give it a little more time than usual to warm up...it'll definitely help."
"The beer is pretty big so, although tasty, more than one could be a little too much."
"Drinkability: $4 for a short bottle? Glad I didn't get the corked and caged variety. There's some interesting things going on, but enough to keep me going back. And though I didn't expect it to taste like an exact non-domestic mimic of the style, they have a long way to go to impress me with this. I'm glad I tried it, especially for Thelonious, but man, I'm not sure he'd be too thrilled if he were to see this in his name."
"Mouthfeel is a little uneven, viscous."
"I like it, but certainly there are better examples out there."
"Brick colored autumn color with a small, well layered hour. Bubble gum and dark fruit in the nose, fairly nice, but could have more depth. Flavor has hints of honey covered fruits, decent belgian character and a decent finish. It's an ok Belgian style beer, better than most American interpretations."
"I think that this would probably be a better beer after a year or so. It would likely smooth out the alcohol that is rather dominant here. I don't want to see it go away entirely, but less of it would let the virtues of Thelonious shine brighter and overall, bring a dose of balance (to the force)."
"Overall I enjoyed this experience, although the sweetness can be a bit much after awhile. Could've been a more perfect brew if it laid off the sugar/fruit by about 25%. Otherwise, definitely worth a try."
"D: Drinkable but high alcohol content would limit multiple bottles in one sitting. Look foward to having again. Love the bottle too, Monk is a jazz king."
"Corked bottle poured into a Chimay chalice...no apparent bottling/vintage date. The brew looks nice, but the aroma is only OK at best. It has a dark (stewed/fruity?) character in the aroma. Taste further supports the aroma, but it does add a bit more complexity. There's a hint of bock/melanoidan character (different, but OK here) with a healthy dose of aged character too (which I don't necessarily like here.) I wonder how old this brew is, but I have no idea from the bottle. Come on breweries...give the end-user some sort of date! Whatever yeast is used doesn't add much of an abbey/trappist flavor to the brew. That's too bad because certain trappist yeast strains might make this brew better. Still, this isn't a bad brew. Overall, it's drinkable, but not something I will seek out again."
"D - Very excellent. Great dessert beer."
"Poured from the 750ml bottle. Nice yeasty notes: hints of plum and dried cherries. Nutty and creamy mouth feel. Little toasty malt and a smooth finish. Like most good craft Belgian style ales, the alcohol is well hidden. Would be a nice pairing with game dishes or chocolate desserts. Dig it."
"Very drinkable and highly recommended for a Dubbel. At 9%, this one definitely packs a punch; especially for how easy it is to drink. I'm curious to try others of this style."
"Poured this into a goblet. Poured a dark amber color with decent head that dissipated rather rapidly. The aroma is malty with a touch of fruit at the end. Flavor is of dark fruit with a bit of alcohol in the taste. Mouthfeel is good. Drinkability is good, but the alcohol is a bit too present in the flavor."
"D= A worthy attempt at a classic Belgian dark ale. Not as good as its pedigreed Belgian cousins, but worth a taste anyway!"
"North Coast did a pretty good job with this one. It could be improved pretty dramatically if the strong dark fruit flavor was scaled back and if the body was thickened a bit. Despite those setbacks, it still proves to be a solid Belgian style release. It's not quite on the level of other authentic Belgians. But, very respectable and worth a try."
"This would have been even a higher rating if not for the head petering out so quickly into oblivion. I got cooked sugar w/ an alcohol(ly) presence from the bouquet. I wasn't expecting much since the only other North Coast brew I have/tried is Old Rasputin RIS (not for me). HOWEVER, this Abbey caught my attention. The first taste reminded of a Blackened Voodoo, but then, an overture of complexities took over. This is quite the brew! I almost always take 20-30 min. to consume 1 bottle when reviewing...and I'm glad I did. The warmer it got, the better it was. Usually, you get more alcohol forcing through, but not w/ this one. The best taste was at the end and leaving me wanting more. Mouthfeel was smooth w/ no sticky(clear your throat) remnants and I could see myself drinking 1-2 more. This was a surprise and ""smoothy drink""."
"Overall: Very apparently american imitating belgium bot not a bad take on the style, if they backed off on the alcohol a little I feel it would be more enjoyable."
"This beer is a little on the sweet side and the alcohol flavor is strong. The bomber is large and I would encourage sharing this brew."
"I can relate with many of the reviews. I'd say this one is definitely nice for people who don't mind the taste of alcohol. Honestly, I'm a hop fiend with a liking for a nice deep barley background, similar to a lot of Stone Brewing Company brews. So that's where I'm coming from."
"When we reviewed this beer fresh, we gave it a B-. Reviewed after aging: an A-. Word to the wise: age it"
"overall i was a little disapointed from what i expected after trying the old stock ale before this (which was very impressive), but a good rendition of a dubble, probably wouldn't buy again though - however i do love the play on belgian monk's and thelonious, great bottle art too :D"
"Mouthfeel is crisp, but nothing to write home about."
"Overall, a little bit of a disappointment. Worth a try, though."
"pours a beautiful deep ruby color with a brownish head that goes away quickly. it smells great, roasted apples, sweet malt and a spicy yeast aroma all complement eachother. taste is very expansive, has chocolately malt flavor, but your belgium yeasty wonderfulness, also a fruity appleish flavor. it really hits all the good spots that makes belgians great. mouthfeel is full and rich, very good. another great beer from north coast."
"deep reddish-brown color with small, long lasting off-white head. aromatics of sweet malts, some subtle fruit, little bit of caramel. tastes is sweet, some wood, oak, light hop crispness. light bodied, low carbo, sweet aftertaste. good brew. good brewery."
"A solid beer"
"Overall: Good, sweet, and strong, but too sweet, too rich. Drink this one in small quantities. Perfect match with a cardamom chocolate, though."
"Overall a very tasty beer, but it lacks a touch of complexity and carbonation which keeps it from catching up with the big dogs of the style."
"Very tasty and there is quite a bit in the mouthfeel. I am happy with this purchase and would like to put this up against a true Belgian."
"D- Not my favorite of the style, but a good beer all in all."
"Drinkability: Old Rasputin is my favorite but I was disappointed greatly by Praqster... I'm glad I gave North Coast another shot. This one is wonderful; easily enjoyed with alcohol well hidden; a new flavor in very sip."
"This is a heavy hitter at nine percent, and 750 is a lot of MLs, but this is an excellent offering from North Coast, and at $6.99, it's relatively reasonable compared to a lot of Belgians."
"D - Pretty good. I would have it again. I've never had a dubbel this malty before. I might have it again. It isn't bad, but it isn't awe inspiring."
"D-At 9.4% abv this stuff is dangerously drinkable and very enjoyable,worth checking out!"
"This was a solid belgian style abbey ale, one that I am willing to pick up again in the future."
"D: Rather good session beer on the spicy side."
"Found it in Chicago at Sheridan Liquors...I don't believe there is a beerfly for it."
"The smell was malty with spices and spiced apples. I tasted the caramel malts with a slight bit of alcohol on the the finish. In the mouth is it gave some residual sugar on the tongue. Overall a well done dubbel and I will buy it again."
"This is a very tasty, somewhat complex beer that hides its 9% ABV rather well. More flavor comes through as it warms. Definitely use a tulip glass for this beer."
"The hops add an abundant spiciness to the mouthfeel. It's very light-bodied for such a strong beer and the only thing really keeping me from chugging it down is the sourness. I'm not overly familiar with the style but I'm sure the sour characteristic was intended. The alcohol itself isn't very noticeable but there is a sharp acidity that can be a little overbearing. Overall pretty enjoyable."
"Drinkability is limited by the alcohol content and the roasted notes that I just don't seem to enjoy in large doses. More than a little personal bias here, but I wouldn't be able to drink two of these in a row. Not bad, worth trying if it is readily available, especially if you really enjoy dubbels."
"Flavors of coco, caramel, light alcohol, dark fruits, and light grains. Faint spice profile."
"D- High alcohol, but hidden well. I will probably revisit this in the future."
"D - Not bad, darker accent than most belgians but very plesent and would not mind picking up some again."
"Overall: A very nice beer, very drinkable and sweet but not in a bad way."
"The drinkability is good, not a bat brew at all. I have seen this in the beer stores for years and fianlly snagged a small one. Quite worth it. Prosit, MK"
"D: I'm glad I didn't get a sixer. It just has too much of a bad aftertaste. This beer needs some balance."
"D: Great drinkability, my only beer of the day, and finished it in about 10 minutes, a good price one of the cheaper Belgian-style American beers out there."
"The flavor get better as the beer becomes warmer. I highly recommend this beer!"
"Perfect drinkability. Full flavored, complex, quaffable all with a good price. Brilliant."
"Into a chalice, pours a nice ruby tinged mahogany, a creamy half-inch taupe head settles a bit thinner to a good film, leaves nice lacing on the glass. The aroma gives beer soaked dark fruits, pear and apple mostly, slight candied sugars. The taste follows the vague hints in the nose, some nice fruits, sugars, a fair yeasty flair and some nice spices. The mouth has good body, almost non-existant carbonation, a bit of warming... in all, a pretty tasty dubbel."
"A decent beer, but a little bit too warming on the alcohol."
"750 ML bottle copped caged and corked from Gary's in Madison... ""Belgian Style Abbey Ale"" on the front logo sticker... pours a dar-brown, ruby-red and mahogany hue, slightly purple with a minimal head that soon receded... smell was very intense and rich, with strong malt aromas that included raisins, plums, and dehydrated fruits... attractive Dubbel taste, true-to-the-style, with noticeable malts, caramel, vanilla, and candy sugar in the flavor that was thick and rich... A very good representation of the style from North Coast... very creamy and thick mouthfeel with good drinkability... very sweet-tasting example full of flavors and character... good stuff from this brewery which usually turns out solid stuff... Recommended..."
"Pretty decent brew. Nothing really earth-shattering but very well balanced and great tasting. Got 2 bottles left and i look forward to drinking them!"
"This dubbel pours an amber brown with a medium tan head. Smell is of ripe apples. Taste is quite malty, with a hint of smokiness, caramel and dough. Mouthfeel is average, carbonation is somewhat prickly. This is a pretty good beer, perhaps isnt very true to the style, but enjoyable none the less."
"A rich thick head that hangs tough on top of the dark caramel colored brew. Tasty, sweet, heavy tongue feel. Has a kick with the aftertaste, the alcohol wraps around your tongue. Squeezes. Over all, nice beer. All the right features, but still there is something that leaves me wanting."
"$7 bucks, no way!! ..smell of faint dryed fruits and chocolate ... as it warms the flavour does improve .. dark prune brown colour ..nice on the tongue but aftertaste is 50-50 ... very odd flavour, good if you really try but is not very enjoyable.. this beer is a janky hoopty!!"
"I'm a big fan of jazz, so let's see if I'm a big fan of Brother Thelonius. Pours dark brown with a thick two-finger rumbling cloud of tan head into my ""Brother Thelonius"" goblet. How fitting. Retention is exceptional. When the head finally decides to fade, a two tiered lacing is left behind. That is, a somewhat thinner layer surrounding the glass sits atop a thicker layer that resided right above the brew. The smell of raisins, white grapes, grain, malt and an undercurrent of sweet syrup makes for intriguing contrasts. Tastes a bit sharper than the nose would lead you to believe, although the end is rounded off. A slight sweetness comes through just before the alcohol heat reveals itself. Dark chocolates and licorice lurk in the shadows. Carbonation is excellent and opens the beer up in your mouth making for a pleasant, almost airy mouth-feel. This is a superbly crafted and very complex beer that is made even better by it's uniqueness. It is quite evident that someone put some effort into this one."
"Labeled 9.4% abv. Aroma is pleasant with a light toasted sensation and moderate piney hops. There was also pear, nutmeg and cinnamon in the aroma. Appearance was nice. Average sized frothy off-white head that played the disappearing act. Color was a very dark amber or brown. The flavor was a bit of a disappointment, salty and sour at first followed by a very strong copper aftertaste. Good attempt at a Belgian strong, but I know that North Coast can do better. According to my dad this is a very good attempt at a common Belgian street ale (although being well traveled, and a great ""nose"" my dad drinks beer more for pure enjoyment at the moment rather than rating them like he does wine). I don't know, I wasn't of legal age last time I was in Belgium."
"Pours a cloudy deep amber/ copper color with a fluffy tan head. In the aroma, Belgiany candy sugar, dark fruitiness, and a white grape. In the taste, dark cherries, candy sugar sweetness and somewhat white grape sour and dryness. A malty and smooth mouthfeel and a dry white grape aftertaste. Fantastic representation of style, complex, and hides the alcohol."
"Shared it with a bunch of friends and they all agreed as well. Definitely a could winters night beer that I will enjoy again and again. Thank you North Coast!!!"
"Hrmm, this is really good. Holds court with one of my favorites, Abbey Ale from New Belgium. This is like it's big brother. A very pleasant brew, just starting to leave me with a pleasant buzz."
"As a fan of jazz, aka American Creative Music, Brother Thelonious is a masterpiece. Purchased in a four pack of 12 ounce bottles, this deep colored dubbel style ale should be approached with respect. To drink more than one of these at a time just means you are seeking inebriation using, or should I say misusing, a very carefully and lovingly created ale, that is indeed a fitting tribute to the musical composer genius who was known as Thelonious Sphere Monk. There is big time complexity here: spicy with dark fruit notes, chocolate, vanilla and plum, to name just a few. Although I did not have a goblet present when I sampled this. I would recommend it as the glassware of choice. An ale to be savored... peacefully."
"Not a terrible effort, but I was hoping for better from this brewery. At least the label (like all North Coast labels) is really cool -- the idea of Thelonious as an actual Monk. Cute."
"If I were judging this beer in a homebrew competition I would add a note that this beer would score better as a Belgian Dark Strong Ale than as a Dubbel. The alcohol is too high for a Dubbel, the body is on the low side and flavor profile is more in line with the Dark Strong."
"Overall: This beer is ok. The style is not my favorite, but the beer good for the style."
"Overall: A nice beer, not an amazing dubbel. The alcohol was a little too prominent, might have done well to age this one for a little longer in the cellar."
"Serving type- Bottle"
"Drinkability - an approachable Belgian-style beer. I'd have it again, the flavor is quite unique, beer tasting material even."
"I've heard it is better in smaller bottles v. the 750 ml bottles."
"Overall experience: This beer followed up my meal of Organic: Meatloaf, iron skillet roasted potatoes w/ onions, and a crap load of steamed broccoli. Really helps to settle a big helping. Plenty of beef flavor still hanging around that this beer just compliments :)"
"I am very impressed with this offering from North Coast. One of my favorite musicians and possibly the coolest looking bottle art ever."
"Pours a dark brown/red color with a good fluffy off white head. The nose is of raisin and belgian yeast and malt. The taste is quite good, moslty dark fruit and belgian yeast with some dark wheat flavors. A good peppery center with an unusual little hop nip on the finish. slightly abrasive mouthfeel and a little bit thin but good overall. good and drinkable for a heavier dubbel. A good american made shot at a dubbel. I like it but it has an american thinness to it. I would say it is defenitely one of the better american brewed dubbels. No lost & found but its up there."
"I'm giving this one the thumbs down. I was sorely disappointed and was hoping for so much more. The beer pours a nice cloudy, tawny brown, with a caramel consistency, and a smallish head. The head dissipated quickly, no lacing either. The smell is caramelized, yeasty, perhaps a tinge of some fruits, such as apple, rind, and lemon. The beer is medium bodied and then it goes down hill fast. This beer does a terrible number in terms of masking its robust ABV, in fact, I got nothing but harsh, throaty alcoholish burn. The beer had none of the candied sugar fermentation, the sweet yeasty malts of a Belgian, or the complex fruity carbonation and warming notes. This beer just hit all the wrong notes. I drank a small glass and got rid of the rest. What a disappointement. It seemed that they just let this one ferment too long until it carmelized what should have been warming notes, and lost its redeeming Belgian character."
"Poured into a chalice a nice dark brown color, nice carbonation (awesome pop on opening), nice little fizzy creamy off-white head, some tiny islands and sticky lacing around the edges. The nose is malty, slightly yeasty, some figs, raisins, plums, and caramel. The taste is sweet, malty, slight yeast effect, nice touch of dark fruit, and some caramel. This brew goes down smoothly, the alcohol is hidden very well. Full body, a complex brew. Very drinkable, very tasty, another great brew from North Coast, recommended."
"I have stored this bottle about a year. Pours a red-hued light brown color, with some haze, and a decent head that lasts to the end. Aroma is dark fruits, with some malt and some wood characteristics. Also hints of yeastiness in the nose. Flavor is more dark fruits, some yeastiness and chocolate malt. Hops are apparent, but very subdued. Very well balanced beer in style. Alcohol comes through, but softly. Body is suitably medium to full, with a creamy carbonation. Aftertaste is lingering dark malt and fruit."
"Overall a pretty good attempt at a Dubbel... I am glad the brewers did not ""Americanize"" this one to the point of diminishing returns... but Brother Thelonious could use more complexity in aroma and flavor and a more full mouthfeel.... that being said, I will buy some more of the 12's to put in the cellar for when I get the urge."
"Overall a pretty authentic tasting Dubbel from North Coast, nicely done."
"The body is smooth with a little bit of a carbonation kicking its way to your brain. It really sits well in your mouth as you let the flavors develop and surface. This really is so tasty, so crisp and refreshing. You must take your time with one of these. So much goodness."
"What a joy this beer was too drink. More please."
"Drinkability: Grab me a four pack and some good jazz and see if I refuse..."
"I love this beer. North Coast does a great job with this Belgian Dubble. Goes great with some Thelonious Monk music. I recommend ""Monks Music", or At Carnegie Hall (with John Coltrane), or Underground, or... well you get the picture. If it has Monks name on it pick it up, including this beer."
"Feels fizzy and thick. Bubbly but subdued by smoothness. Would prefer a bit less bubbly, personally. It's really strong and very rich. Sweet and yet also roasted, no mean feat. A Belgian Abbey to the core: good example of the style."
"Other than the slight aluminum flavor, this would be a winner. Similar to the traditional Abbeys but just misses."
"Overall: Nice Beligan brew with tons of flavors. Very nice brew."
"Drinkability- Not bad for a evening or late meal."
"Corked and caged 750ml bottle poured into a St. Bernardus chalice. Pours a dark brown color with a light tan head. The aroma is sweet malt, dark fruits (plums and raisins) yeast and spices. The taste is malt up front with a dry and spicy finish. The mouthfeel is light-medium bodied with a good amount of carbonation. Overall, this is a very nice Belgian-styled beer produced domestically here in the states. Recommended."
"While I prefer trippels and quads, this dubbel is on the par with some of the better ones I've had - not top of the line but definitely worth a glass or two."
"A nice effort on the part of North Coast. I keep picking up additional flavors and sensations in the mouth as I continue to sip. Not sure how to describe some of them but I am enjoying myself."
"I like what Brother Thelonious has to offer. At the risk of beating a dead horse, it does most everything right... except carbonation. Otherwise, it's a jazzy little number that is making my taste buds dance with joy. I consider the $7.59 money well spent and will gladly buy a few more bottles the next time I have the opportunity."
"Brown color with a smattering of bubbles at the surface of the beer. The first thing I smell is like chocolate and makes me think of Old Stock. The taste is fruity, like plums, with an almost barleywine flavor. This seems like Old Stock with Belgian yeast.This is a sipper for sure given the ABV. There is some noticeable phenolic flavor but is is not strong enough to detract from the flavor."
"My only comparison is St Bernadus Prior 8. This is a good beer but not quite up to the St Bernadus standard. Pours a hazy brown color, some light comes through the top of the glass. Big off white head that fades down to a covering of the glass. Lacing does not linger but the initial lacing is a complete curtain-like covering of the sides of the glass. Nose is pretty good, dark fruits, a little astringincy and alcohol. The St Bernadus is more complex. Brother Thelonius has the sweetness and dark fruit (plums and cherries) taste. It is missing the astringency and malty and astringent tastes that wend their wy through other Belgian style beers. Mouthfeel is rich. The alcohol taste is a bit too forward. Drinkability for a Belgian is fairly good...for beers in general, a bit lower based on abv. Would not be a bad introduction to the style, but I would take a St Bernadus over this one every time."
"I had this at the Autumn Brew Review in Minneapolis, MN. It is also available at The Cellars Wine & Spirits in Roseville in a bottle. Brownish in color with a little head. Quite a complex beer. Brown sugar, dark fruit and a bit of caramel in aroma. Dark fruit and brown sugar in flavor with a hint of alcohol."
"oh well, at least i've still got a six of ruination and a copy of hard boiled to look forward to! i'll toast to that!"
"Poured into a Duvel chalice. Appearance is a translucent deep amber/brownish with average off white head and minimal lacing. Smell is of sugar and dates, pretty one dimensional, some phenols coming through. Taste is quite malty with slight bitterness of figs/dates/sugar (although its not really that complex), fairly thin mouthfeel for a true dubbel. Its a good American Dubbel, but not extraordinary due to thin body and lack of complexity. The alcohol is handled fairly well with only a light phenolic taste coming through. I smile at a 9% dubbel. Overall a thumbs up and a solid beer but nothing I'd seek out like a world class offering. Then again, I wouldnt turn it down and would prefer this over a lot of what other american craft breweries offer."
"Looks the part. Thick looking dark auburn tone. Nice cap of dense beige froth. Retention is great as is the lacing. Nice aroma of fudge, raisin, rumcake and dates. Taste is a little hot to start with. Like a fruit punch kind of alcohol feel. Underneath the EtOH are some lighter layers of fudge and bread pudding. Dates and raisins come into the picture, but the alcohol laced fruitiness is king here. Alcoholic bitterness lingers. Has the makings of a pretty good dubel if the heat were kept in check or integrated a little better."
"A bit on the sweet side, but that is the style. Well done double - wish we had more US beers of this style."
"Not a bad beer, but if I am looking for this style there are many beers for the money I drink first."
"Recommended, but not great."
"The beer pours from the caged and corked 750ml brown bottle a hazy mahogany color with a portly white head that is creamy in texture as it slowly fades away; the lace forms a nice concealing blanket upon the glass. Start has a nice malt sweetness, hints of fruit, I say cherries, and also a bit of alcohol, top is light to medium in feel. Finish is prickly in its acidity, the hops present, and the alcohol provides a bitter bite, dry and long lasting aftertaste."
"D - I will say this, were it lacks complexity, it is expressive, and a good mix with food (an Italian veggie dish with more than a little cheese was good)."
"Drinkability- This was a great beer. I shared this one with a friend. It would have been a bit much to drink on my own."
"The brew pours a murky reddish brown. A bubbly head quickly worked down to a small thin cap. Modest lacing as the brew is drank. Smell is sweet dry fruits; mostly raisins and cherry. Brown sugar. Bread. Some alcohol definitely noted. Taste brings the raisins and cherry notes on strong. Sweet malt bread and peppery alcohol. The alcohol dominates the mouth, helping the sweetness of the malt and fruit notes from over powering this brew. Still a full mouthfeel, fairly chewy. One bomber was enough, but I enjoyed it."
"A true sipper of delicate nature. Again, the warmer the better."
"As most long time BA's are aware, I do not get the Belgian thing. Never have caught on to them like most of you. I don't like North Coast's Pranqster at all but a co-worker and fellow lover of No. Coast beers urged me to try this. Seeing as I like some jazz and Brother T, I agreed to try it. Not bad! Deep amber or even copper color. familiar Belgian yeast aroma is there but is not overpowering in the taste department. No cloves, no banana, no bubblegum notes either. I can live with this. A bit fruity and a distinct Belgian taste that I could live with. Is sit a staple for me now? No, but I did buy a Brother Thelonious T-Shirt. Will save my remaining bottles for when it gets towards winter."
"Comment: I keep The Monk in my stash. It complements a New York Strip dinner, jazz and the company of good friends."
"One of North Coast's best"
"The mouthfeel I love, but it is a little to heavy for the dubble style, more of just a belgium dark strong ale.Still a great beer, and it is wonderful with a medium bodied cigar."
"Overall, I give North Coast kudos for making a decent dubble. Seemed too sweet and lacking in complexity of a great dubbel, but a decent effort."
"Medium full in body. I heard bad things, but this is very much my speed. Need to try and get more. Nice!"
"recorked and finished a few hours later - while a glass was enjoyable, the overall drinkability isn't terribly high."
"Poured from a 750 ML bottle into a chalice glass. The deep ruby is thick looking and the head is a tight carbonation of white and a tint of red. The aroma is a slight raisin, plum, sour fruit. The flavor is close to a dubbel; the sourness and malty sweetness mix well. Body is medium to heavy; very slick coating of the palate. One bottle is all I would want and probably out of a 12 OZ. Worth a try and someone may find this exceptional."
"Too sweet without much else, for me. Worth splitting with a friend, and for a good cause. A decent stab at the style, but put it next to an authentic Belgian dubbel...and, well..."
"Pours a rusty tan color with moderate head and lacing. Fruity, sweet nose, silky mouthfeel, and very drinkable. The beer's 9% ABV is hidden pretty well under a cloak of traditional Belgian flavors. A very nice beer, indeed."
"Overall, I like this one. It has nice flavors and a good level of drinkability to make this one to really enjoy. I certainly like it, and plan to get more, but not before others in the style...i think there is better for the same price."
"The taste is creamy and malty. None of the fruits come through really. Nice smoky aftertaste with a dry finish that smacks of cloves. Nice sweetness to the brew, it does indeed taste like a dubbel! Not the complexity I'd like to see but not the hop assault I feared, either! The mouthfeel is crisp & smooth, but a bit watery, at least for something so malty. The drinkability is good. Alcohol warmth lets you know its there without beating you about the head & shoulders. The finish isn't too dry & the start isn't too sweet. Nice. Overall, a fine beer & one I'd buy again on occasion."
"A big hearty flavor, not smooth or soft, a bit wild, reminds me of homebrew in some ways. A nice experience, but tough to get a feel for it...I'd like the opportunity to try another against this first one. Maybe on-tap is the way to go next time."
"This one may have helped sway my choice of favorite style. I'll have to move one into my beginner cellar."
"Fruit dominates the palate upon the first swig, as pear, prune, and cranberry are complemented with a big alcohol presence. The alcohol gives the tongue a nice workout, but it doesn't overpower the flavor. As it warms, a huge malty backbone balances well with a touch of spicy hops. The mouthfeel is dry, smooth, crisp, and mellow as Thelonious himself. A great fruity finish caps this one off, as well as a bit of bitterness. Overall, this is a tasty, aromatic, and very smooth-drinking dubbel. Another amazing offer from the rarely-disappointing North Cost."
"Opinion: This beer is pretty decent. It is quite fruity for my taste, as I like my Dubbels a bit closer to the malt profile of a Bock. This one reminds me more of how homebrewed examples taste. The malt is a bit raw here, and this beer would probably benefit from a bit more ageing. There is nothing wrong with this beer, but it isn't one of my absolute favorites. I would drink it again if someone else was passing it around, but I doubt I will buy another bottle."
"D- It's so good. Do yourself a favor and try this beer. North Coast has succeeded in making a dubbel many Belgians would be jealous of."
"This beer pours a dark amber with a decent head that laces the glass with solid carbonation. Aroma is dark fruits, cherries, prunes, plums and raisins while the taste reflects that with dark chocolate covered cherries and raisins; eventually shows a little fruitcake taste as it warms. It's a sipper with a dark, heavy flavor like and old red wine. I like some of the lighter Belgian ales more, but this is a solid dark Belgian though I have Rochefort ranked ahead of this brew."
"Brother Thelonious isn't a bad beer, but is far from being one of my favorites. Points to North Coast for thinking outside the box and doing something interesting with the style. Try if you like Dubbels, or jazz music."
"Taste: Carbonation in the low-to-mid range, the smokey flavors come more than anything else. No real sign of spicy yeast flavors, just a bit of acidity that didn't quite make my mouth pucker. Woody, corky flavors are the only characteristics that make it seem like a Belgian ale to me. Not my favorite from this brewery, but interesting."
"Overall this is not a bad dubbel, and one of the more true to style examples of the american versions. It's not a style that I tend to overindulge in (perhaps my least favorite of the belgians, which are my favorites overall), so I sip and slow and let it linger."
"Overall an enjoyable dubbel."
"Had this on-tap at Bodega in Columbus, Ohio. Poured into a pint glass. Cloudy red with little to no head, although it kept lightly fizzing. Smells of caramel and dark fruit like cherries. Tastes of banana, caramel, toasted barley, no notes of hops. Medium mouthfeel. Higher alcohol means slower sipping. Nice, complex flavors and aromas. Beautiful beer to look at. Would gladly try this one again."
" This is a weekday sipper. The alcohol is very powerful. All in all a nice beer to enjoy."
"DRINKABILITY-Lets not kid ourselves, I drank the whole bottle and felt a bit indulgent. However I got over it and did really enjoy it altogether. With this being my first rating, maybe I am going a little overboard with the numbers but hey, its for Thelonius freaking Monk! Dig the bottle by the way, one of the best ever...I have seen hundreds along the way..."
"the beer itself is very complex in flavor and smell. it was a corked bottle which didn't overflow with foam at first, but it started slowing spilling out after a few seconds. nice head on the beer but it doesn't stay as thick and gets pretty small actually. its a very dark red but doesn't look hazy. it smells fruity and yeasty overall..but there are other spices mixed in there as well that i can't really place. maybe a hint of alcohol.. (9%) the taste is even more complex. its similar..starts out more with the fruity part which mellows out and you can pick up on more of the yeast flavor. once again theres other flavors too here and there that i'm not sure what to liken them to. the flavor is a bit strong, but its very good. not something i would want to drink all night for sure. it was 7.99 for a 750ml bottle, not as expensive as some of the other large corked bottles, but i would say its up there with them in taste."
"The beer pours a cloudy brown color with a thick frothy tan head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a nice, malty scent that boasts of crystal malts and Belgian yeast. It's sweet with the alcohol warmth and a fruity presence; raisons, figs. The taste is decent. It's full of malt flavor especially the crystal malts and a bit of special roast. It has a solid yeast fruitiness with a warm raisony finish. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a good drinking beer. It's a bit too much with the alcohol warmth. It could also use some more body and/or specialty malts. All in all, a fine effort."
"It has a decent color to it. Darker than a red but not as attractive as other beers. Nice looking head on it that fades rather quickly. The smell is very subtle. Some raison... kind of bread-y. Tastes... malty, alcohol, very little hoppiness at the end. Adequately carbonated, though I prefer the aged beers that have settled down. Feels alright sliding down my tongue. As far as drinkability... I've had way better. I probably won't buy it again, but it's better than a Budweiser."
"Overall a very good brew, it'd definitely be one I'd pick up again. Loved the smokey flavor. Big props to North Coast Brewing for this one."
"Bottle courtesy of Bu11zeye: Poured a deep mahogany color ale with a medium size dirty brown head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of sweet malt with a small touch of dry fruits is quite interesting. Taste of sweet malt is offset by some light dry fruits. Body is quite full with some adequate carbonation and no alcohol was noticeable. I thought it lack some complexities for the style but still very enjoyable nonetheless."
"Not a bad US version of a Belgian Dubbel at all, and cheaper than a comparatively-sized bottle of the real thing. I'd definitely drink this again."
"D- simple for a belgian, bland at times, nothing worthwhile, at least its for a charity"
"It poured a dark brown with a nice retention. Plenty of ripe, dark fruits in the nose such as raisins, ... On the palate, though, quite a medium bodied beer with a thick mouthfeel, which finishes with touches of roasted caramel. Very nice. This one keeps calling you back for more."
"D- Seems pretty average at first, and my description so far portrays that initial feeling. But by the time I finished my first half-pint, I was loving it. Not sure why."
"Started at first with just a hint of pear funkyness, calling to mind Orval, then blossomed with a broad caramel malt, retaining some of the yeasty Belgian nontes. Moderately sweet, with a full finish. The name is a great play on words, and the beer matches the innovative nature."
"D: Yum! I really like it. This one goes down really easy. The alcohol stays in the background despite the 9%. A beer to sip slowly."
"Pours Clear, dark amber with a good long-lasting tan head. Malty aromas with some banana and bubblegum. Slight touch of alcohol on the nose and flavor. Nice hop finish but light for a Dubbel. Not a bad beer but it could use a little more Umph to it."
"From the 750ml bottle to a Trappist glass - a rich ruby color with a marginal head. A malty citrus aroma as well as some caramel. The caramel came out in the flavor as well along with some vanilla and some fruitiness. I picked up the hoppiness at the end. Smooth and chewable. This is a very good beer - maybe a step below Chimay Blue."
"Deep dark brown with ruby highlights. Offwhite head dissipated quickly with no retention. Smelled lovely -- stewed fruit (like tsimis, for my jewish bretheren) with a heavy hand of cocoa. Tasted wonderful - not like any other dubbel that I'd ever had -- prunes up front to be sure, and a bit of a yeasty spice, but pure cocoa and alcohol on the finish, like drinking chocolate milk with a shot of jameson. Glad I found this on tap, though seeing the label on the site makes me want to buy a bottle and stick the label on my board."
"Pours a rootbeer brown. Tan head dissapates quickly with some lacing. Smells like gingerbread and fermenting dough, very nice on the nose. Tastes of some Belgium sugars, and bread. Phenols come out fast but fade nicely at the end. It really has a typical dubbel taste profile, but for some reason it deosn't seem as balanced as some better examples. I can't put my finger on it, but this beer just doesn't quite live up to it's namesake. Mouthfeel is a little light, which I think contributes to the unbalance. Drinkinbility is fine."
"Pours a deep, rich burgundy tone, with a bubbly off-white head that dissipates quickly to a thin layer. Appears very effervescent. Spotty lacing in the goblet. The nose is of dark roasted malts, stewed fruits, sweet caramel, and some spice thrown in. Some alcohol in the nose. The palate is what you'd expect from the nose, and carries a very sweet, cloying flavor up front. A combination of the (very) active carbonation, high ABV, and a good, solid hop backbone, turn this brew quite a bit drier quickly, however. The palate is left somewhat decently balanced, but definitely leaning heavily toward the sweet side of things. Not unexpected for a dubbel, but maybe a bit too cloying. Mouthfeel is a tad sharp and biting, with an abundance of carbonation creating a froth in the mouth and revealing an aggressive alcohol burn. This aspect calms down as the beer warms from cellar temperature to ambient a bit. Finish is only semi-dry, with some sweetness lingering too long. Over all, not a bad dubbel, especially considering this is a domestic abbey-style ale. At 9% ABV, this one is no session beer. Worth a try, however, especially if you like the dubbel style. It's no Trappist ...but what else is?"
"Poured a crisp brown that shows a dark ruby when held to light. The aroma is of dried fruits with maple and caramel. The taste is very complex with caramel, dried fruits, some coffee, and a nice slight spiciness to round it out. There is a slight yeast bite and the alcohol is somewhat present. This is a decent beer for the style."
"Poured out of a 750ml corked and caged bottle. The beer is a dark ruby color that poured an average tan head that dissipated fairly quick leaving no lacing. The smell is prunes, carob, and a whiff of alcohol. The taste is similar but has more of a roasted backbone to it. The feel is tightly carbonated and a bit watery, finishes a tad bitter and dry. A decent example of a dubbel and worth a try but it doesn't excite."
"DA: This was very enjoyable; although certainly not my favorite of it's kind. This beer was the last to be enjoyed out of my favorite beer vessel, my big oversize goblet...at least it went out in a blaze of glory as I listened to Thelonious and Coltrane on my record player."
"A very complex interpretation of a Belgian Ale by North Coast Brewing. I feel they did a pretty good job. Recommended."
"25 .oz bottle poured into a clean chalice . With a very aggressive pour there is little head , none . Not like the the chalice on the label . The head faded so quick , very disappointing . Smells of chocolate and fruit. Brown clear hue with no lacing as head reduced to nothing . Taste is spicy like BBQ sauce but also very watery . This not the worst brew I have had during my new hobby but this is bland , boring , brown water . Bleak . When this quest of finding "" new beer "" was started there have been some lousy beers but this is very disappointing . The 9 abv is well hidden , hidden behind a boring lousy brew for 9+ bucks a bomber . First time , last time ."
"It poured out with a nice thick, tan head that was really fluffy and slowly dissipated into a thin layer that gathered around the edge of the glass and created a nice medium lacing. It has a nice dark reddish/brown color and is really beautiful when held up to the light. Its aroma is not as strong as I thought it would be; its mild with sweet undertones and it has a bitter taste that seems to over power the sweetness in it. It also has a mild cry aftertaste that has a hint of alcohol to it."
"I suppose that we are lucky to get this one time brew in Sweden. Good old Systemet hit us with two beers from NCBC in February, 2007. The other was Rasputin. Brother Thelonius poured in a brown color with lots of thick late-colored foam but settling down to a finger. The smell slowly filled the room- apricot, yeast, caramel and licorice. The taste had an initial metallic feature followed by sweet fruits, some yeast, and licorice and alcohol in the end. The head was almost gone at this time. All and all I found it rather restrained, bordering on watery."
"All in all, a well above average strong dark. Great sipping beer. North Coast gets a thumbs up for this one."
"D: Too high ABV and slightly boozy, but nonetheless, a decent offering. Strong alcohol flavor as expected from North Coast."
"Poured in a heavy glass chalice, formed a 1/4"" tan head over the totally murky reddish brown brew. Head slowly fades to an uneven layer of bubbles, with quick-falling lacing that rathers be in contact with the liquid. Aroma is hearty malt sweetness and alcohol. Taste is moderate grain upfront, quickly overpowered by some fruit tartness and drying alcohol, which warms the gullet as well. Mouthfeel seems a bit thin for such a substantial brew, and drinkability is really not that great. I'm looking for more malt character and depth of overall flavor, don't need to be wowed by alcohol vapors."
"Drinkability- A very nice brew that has some very tasty characteristics. Definitely a nice tasty treat every-once-in-a-while but not more than one bottle type beer. An excellent cheese and cracker beer."
"Very nice dark brown color with a small beige head. Aside from a great looking color the head was unimpressive and was only worth a 3.0. The aroma is very complex and smells of very sweet malts, hops, coffee, expresso, and roasted grains. The taste is very very sweet and almost too much for me. I am not into very sweet food or drink. Moderate bitterness with an extremely dry coffee-like finish. The mouthfeel lacks carbonation and is a touch watery. The high ABV is very evident and felt after about five sips. Lacks the typical Belgian Yeast aroma and taste I've come to expect and love with just a tiny showing in the taste. I think U.S brewers should leave Belgian Strong Ale's up to the Belgians. The is a feeble attempt to perfect greatness. After about five minutes the head completely dissapeared and gave it a look of flat cola. The cork gave a loud pop when opened so I know there was no leak that might lose carbonation. I wouldnt reccomend this and wouldn't try it again. Stick with real Belgian products."
"Great colour, mostly clear medium brown pour with no head. Chocolate and toffee aroma. Strong alcohol roaming right up front, with fruity and floral hops and bready yeast notes. Bit of a watery mouthfeel and a fakey coke or candy floss aftertaste."
"Nicely balanced. A rich and complex array of flavors. Foams up in mouth just about perfectly. The hop flavor jumps right out initially, subsides, and then the malt blooms. The result is a tasty cherry/plum/grape dark fruit brew. Warmth is surprisingly low for a 9.4%. This brew is quite filling, my stomach tells me it is full only 550 ml into BT, silly stomach. Also, I feel thirsty, this brew isnt much for thirst-quenching. All things considered: the more I have, the more I like it"
"Overall an O.K beer, nice looks, a bit weak on the nose and it lost me in the taste. The flavors washed out to fast for me and left a bit of a watery feel on the tongue. With the wash out at the end leaves this brew a bit low on the drinkability."
"A somewhat disappointing beer for a beer with a great name and equally creative label. The appearance is a reddish mahogany with a modest head that bubbles away rather quickly in my Chimay goblet. The aroma was minimal at best. Maybe a passing wiff of chocolate, but is that the best this accomplished brewery can do? I expect more for the price. The taste is equally understated and unremarkable. Some maltiness but what is the dominate taste? Chocolate maybe? Nothing more than a hint of brown sugar. The mouthfeel was smooth and void of any hop bitterness. Some carbonation. Yeah, it's a drinkable brew, but somewhat unremarkable for North Coast."
"D: Good."
"amber with soapy big head, lace. Watery, sweet and orange peel, which makes it easy to drink, herbal tea spicey which turns it off for me. A tad toasted malt. Thanks Derek.Big alcohol, not noticeable, but inefficient to the taste. Serviceable beer, not quite up to its style. So passable."
"drinkability is ok. alcohol is a bit high and a touch too sweet."
"Brother Thelonious pours a beautiful deep ruby/crimson with a light off-white head. Smell is a slight sour maltiness with a hint of toasted grains, fruity with some damp and citrusy hops. Taste is rich and malty. Lots of fruity esters with a nice resiny hop bitterness and flavor more than balancing out the malts. Its sweet, but not overly so for 9% abv. Alcohol is apparent but doesn't really detract from the beer overall. Nice hints of darker malts as well. There is a bit of yeasty flavor, as well as the same slight sourness from the aroma. I really enjoyed this beer and I'll be sure to grab it again when I can afford it."
"Poured into a Duvel glass, this makes an absolutely pour: dark reddish-tinted mahogany with a huge, rocky head head of foam--nearly 3 inches. Nose is a bit light--malty, with fruity esters--but not rich. Delightful flavor, though: toffee, bread-crust malt, with a huge fruitiness (ripe cherries, soaked and cooked raisins). Alcohol is only lightly apparent by the warming at the finish. Good bodied, medium-light for the strength, as appropriate for the style."
"Pours a two-fingered light tan head that fades slowly leaving a good lace. Hazy red/amber color. Light-medium carbonation and medium-heavy bodied. Raisin nose. Starts as sweet raisin/maple, hints of the high ABV with a prickly finish. 750ml bottle gift from Boston, MA area."
"Pours a hazy dark burgundy color with a foamy beige head that recedes into a moderate lace. Nose is fruity cherry and plum along with some brown sugar and spicy alcohol. Taste begins with sweet maple syrup and dark fruit along with some bready yeast. There are more subdued flavors of chocolate and banana towards the middle of the taste. A dry and spicy alcohol flavor comes across towards the finish. Enjoyable enough now, but Id be curious to see how this develops with a little aging."
"Drinkability - The high carbonation really gives this a distinct taste unlike every other belgian dark. Has all the typical flavors with very good balance. Really enjoyable."
"Last swigs: 9.0% ABV. Wow! Well hidden until the end. I wish that this finished with a sweeter doughy finish but the harsh finish didn't make the grade."
"You really wouldn't want this as a session beer. And you might not want it again because there are so many great belgians from belgium, why mess with perfection."
"No attempt to hide any of the 9% and the distraction makes it less drinkable to me. Cool label."
"Beer poured a deep mahogany with an off white head that is hanging in well. Nose is sticky sweet malts and candies as well as hints of dark fruits. Taste is of candied sugar, malts, dark fruits. Mouthfeel is nice and smooth. Overall drinkability is good as the brewer did a nice job of masking the abv. This is not far from being an awesome beer but it lacks the true belgian yeast that would make it great. But it is definitely a nice beer and worthy of a try."
"D- It is a nice brew. As it warms I like it more and more. I had this beer when I first started getting into beer and thought it was really bad. I bought it again to just see how things have changed and already in this short of period I have come to really like this."
"After wrestling the cork out for 10 minutes, poured into a tumbler at 48 degrees. beer was auburne colored with a good head that had fine little bubbles. Beer smelled like fresh bread with a fruity apricote kinda taste. Beer would have been better tasting but strong alcohole afterburn was overpowering."
"A really good attempt at packaging of this product. The cork and tie-down, the label, and 750 mil bottle all make a convencing Belgian look; even with a bit of sarcasm in the image. Pours a rich, rust color with a 50% haze and good head retention. Very sweet in the nose--some of malts, some of complimentary grains, sugars, and fruity esters. Tastes very sweet with barley malts, candy sugars, wheat malt, and an underlying confectionate sugar flavor. Balanced with a mild hop bitterness, alcoholic bite, and fruitcake variety. Still, lacking the complexity and true Belgian yeast characters. Not as tart or pepery as I like in true Belgian varieties. Just not funky enough. The feel is nearly sticky-sweet, rich, and full; helped out with some alcohol thinning, but remains very sweet well into the aftertaste. Overall, a fine brew, but cannot compete with the Belgian greats, especially for the price."
"I poured the first glass of the 750ml Brother Thelonius into a Caracole snifter. The beer poured a mahogany color and left a very thin layer of amber head atop a rather fragrant brew. The aromas are of citrus and carmel/toffee, this beer has that distinctive Belgian abbey ale fragrance. After the first sip, I could not help to say WOW! The glass has a very light layer of lacing. Brother Thelonius has a very distinct bing cherry overtones followed by the typical sweetness found in most dark Belgian ales. The 9% alcohol content is masked temporarily by the cherry flavors, but it is definitely present. My over all opinion of the North Coast Brewery is that they are amazing for an American brewery. I have been an avid fan of Red Seal Ale and Pranqster for several years, but this beer just put North Coast into my top ten favorite breweries. This beer comes highly recommended from me."
"I think North Coast or at least my local Coop is getting rich off of this one. I paid $6.35 for a 750 corked and caged bottle of this while a four pack of the same breweries North Coast PranQster Belgian was only $6.85. They tasted very similar, the biggest difference being the higher alcohol content of Brother Thelonious. Poured a rich ruby red color and left a nice tan head and nice rings of lacing as it slowly settled. Nose is of yeast, flowers, malts, and hops, with banana.. Palate is of alcohol, and flavor is sweet and light hops which makes it really clean tasting and easy to drink. Finish is stongly of alcohol with a slight bitterness in the finish. Good brew and while I like it I can suggest saving a bunch of money like I said in the beginning of this review . Buy a botte of each and blind taste them as I did and you willl see what I mean."
" Wavz"
"The thick sweetness detracts from the mouthfeel and drinkability. This is an ale that you almost have to pair with strongly seasoned food, or as an after-dinner in lieu of dessert. Not what I was looking for, but it may have its place."
"Overall Impression: A perfect way to spend MLK day frozen into my house by an ice storm. A fire, some smooth R&B, and a banned and misunderstood beer (beer currently banned for sale by the TABC due to some label issue, I believe the abv tested out slightly differently). A toast to Dr. King and our continued struggle to the promised land."
"A decent Belgian strong ale, but the sweetness hinders the drinkability. Good one to try, but not a regular in the rotation."
"This beer looked really good coming out of the bottle into my La Fin Du Monde tulip. Nice head retention, solid lacing and a real nice brown copper hue. The smell was quite pungent with a lot of alcohol in the nose. Taste left a bit to be desired. I liked the initial taste, and then the alcohol hit. The burn was a bit too much for my liking and the mouthfeel was too strong with alcohol. I let the beer warm up a bit thinking I could get more of the underlying taste, but to no avail. I am a huge fan of North Coast, but this beer was just too abrasive for me. I took my time with this beer and eventually had to give the rest to my roommate. A decent beer, but not up to par from what I expected from North Coast. Although I don't feel bad paying 8 bucks for since partial proceeds from this beer go to charity. Worth a try but nothing worthy of seeking out."
"Mouthfeel is medium to light with mild carbonation. Still pretty smooth. Due to the complexity of the flavor, I wouldn't want too much at once. It would be a sensory overload. Still very good. I think I would want to stash a few away for later. Plus the label is absolutely gorgeous."
"Pours a good looking dark brown and hazy with some garnet hue when held to light. Thin tan head and nothing mentionable. Aromas of raisons, dark fruits, and sour cherries mingle with some faint marshmallow like sweetness between whiffs of alcohol and phenolic esters. The taste starts off general with roasted malts, medium tart dark fruits, and some character, but soon moves into deeper complexities. Emerging are notes of raisons, plums, soft spice, smooth nutty malts, and the background buttery and toffeish. Increasing towards the end are spicy hop characters. Very even, syrupy mouthfeel and little carbonation. The finish has residual hop characters with some sweet malty plum and raison. Nice complexities here and am looking forward to finding another."
"Whisky/toffee/yeasty flavors on the tongue... bready... fennel... very sweet. Complex, but not exceptionally so... a touch cloying."
"Poured a dark amber/ruby brown color and somewhat murky. A fluffy, cream colored head dissipates quickly. A touch of lacing is left behind. The surface is covered in semi-large bubbles and a thin film. Aromas of bread, honey, cream, plums, and dates. The taste follows the nose with a creamy and smooth texture. Subtle hops with a strong malt presence. Candy and juicy fruit dominated flavors. Warming alcohol sensation rounds out session."
"Pours a opaque reddish brown color with a medium sized off white head that recedes quickly and doesn't leave much of hint it was ever there. Wonderful smell of chocolaty malts, brown sugar, and a mix of spices. Very chocolaty flavor, with a strong presents of malts, a hint of hops however it seems to be just a background flavor. There is also hints of plum/raisins and nice spices to help with this one. Carbonation and the such are quite right and it feels nice and warm headed down. Overall a very drinkable beer my only real complaint is an aesthetic one and even then it isn't that bad."
"When poured it was a medium dark brown with a reddish hue. Very little foam and no lace after pouring into the glass. The smell of roasted malts and hints of fruit and spices filled the nose. The taste was of roasted malts and spices, with a hint of prunes. Not really an overpowering Strong Ale, but strong enough to really enjoy this beer!"
"A difficult style for most american craft breweries, but North Coast pulls it off well. I love the acknowledgement and recognition for the great Thelonious Monk."
"Pours a rich brown with a small head and little lacing. Smells of bubblegum and prunes. The flavor is meaty, pruney, and with stewed fruit. The finish is malty and smokey. The mouthfeel is only medium bodied, but also a little sticky. Drinkability is not bad, but overall is a little simplistic in the overall effect."
"Drinkability: Great here, provided you don't mind the alcohol burn. Sometimes it is appropriate and other times not. Try one next time you see it!"
"Poured out a somewhat dark murky brown with a tight bubbly tan head. The nose had some alcohol, sherry, and moderate spice. The taste offered some alcohol, sour cherry, spice, and a slight medicinal note. The mouthfeel was rather creamy, long finish."
"The richness is a bit overpowering, for me anyway. however this is a nice beer. I should have bought another bottle."
"Overall, this ale is deserving of high 80's to low 90's and I would personally recommend it to any avid beer drinker."
"Cheers"
"Poured chestnut-brown into a Burgundy wine glass, where a small layer of light brown bubbles top the brew. A warm, rich aroma of yeast and caramelized fruits bubbles up, preceding a taste of toffee, baked plums, and that telling Belgian je ne sais quoi that unites all of the country's brews and their derivatives. Supremely smooth, just like it's namesake on the piano. A top-shelf American version of a Belgian style."
"This is a good beer all around, and a good American attempt at a fairly difficult Belgian style. It is good, and I will buy it again, but it just lacks that ""WOW"" factor that many of the North Coast beers have. Overall I think it's quite a nice beer, but not the ""hallmark of a style"" that some North Coast beers have (like Old Rasputin)."
"Drinkability is a tough one, the alcohol is very obvious in this beer, which sort of overwhelms the senses, this is a tasty beer thats a tad heavy-handed."
"meh"
"Mouthfeel is medium, full-bodied with enough carbonation that it does not become heavy on the palate. A bit cleaner than native Belgian beers but approaches cloying to me after 10-12 ounces. This one is a real mixed bag for me."
"violant pour yields a blackish brown body with 2 fingers of tan fuzzy head. Nose is softly sweet and nicely spicey with hints of ginger and cinamon with earthy malt. Very syrupy sweet up front when you first sip, really wakes up the buds. Syrupy malt dominates the palate. You really get almost a raw molasses feel. Finishes with this same long earthy sweet mouth feeling. It does mellow and smooth out a bit as it warms. Not bad but not one of my favorite American made Belgium styles."
"pours a deep ruby colored body with a small creamy tan head which dissipates quickly down to a skim. Nose is of sweet, dark fruity (plums) malt and chocolate. Smell of alcohol becomes more prominent as it warms. Initial taste is of bready and fruity malts and is followed up by some spicy alcohol. Body is big, full and chewy with very low carbonation. Overall a decent brew."
"Drinks alright for the abv, says it's an abbey-style ale. This works for me a slightly amped up dubbel"
"Drinkability - decent, not great ale here, and the high abv also inhibits sessionability."
"A bit brash now, but delish nonetheless, and has great cellaring potential. Well done."
"Medium bodied and fairly drinkable, the most exciting aspect of this beer was it's relative dryness. Very dry for a North American Belgian beer."
"D: Definately a drinkable example of the style, though I don't think I'd search this out again. Decent brew from a good brewery though."
"Dark brown color with bright ruby highlights, this beer is topped by a thick tan colored head. The head did recede relatively quickly back into the glass. The nose has dark toffee, dates, figs, black cherry and light spice. No noticeable hop character from the aroma. The dark berry character is emphasized in the flavor, rich and sweet. The spice is light, and not overbearing. A light orange hop character comes in towards the finish and melds with the spice. Light alcohol warming in the finish. The mouth feel is full, and smooth. Very nicely done."
"This brew poured a beautiful dark ruby/red color with a 2 inch light tan head that stuck around. Aroma was spicy with a good bit of caramel malt aromas in the nose. Taste: dark chocolate, molasses, brown sugar, chocolate covered cherries and spicy hops combined with warming alcohol. Excellent! Mouthfeel was medium to full bodied with a chewy character in each swallow. Drinkability is good, but savor this one slowly. This is a solid offering from North Coast and one that fit the bill perfectly on a cold Fall evening."
"and do I need to comment on that label;? Too cool! Brother Monk holding court!"
"D: If it didn't get me so drunk, i'd drink it all night."
"Smells of spice, caramel or molasses, dates and such, with a bready, yeasty backbone. I was afraid itd be a little too sweet, but it delivered nicely on taste. Started sweet - maybe a tad too much for my taste, but has a dry, hoppy finish. Mouthfeel was velvety, not overly carbonated, and pleasant. A nice rendition of the style."
"Dangerously intoxicating at a mere 9%. Very drinkable though."
"Overall it was a fun beer though the soy sauce smell still kind of confuses me"
"Not a bad beer, but not a great one either. Seems like the spice additions were over the top. There's not a lot of subtlety and balance here."
"Very dark brown. Good clarity and color. Brilliant magenta when held to light. Quickly diminishing, sandy colored head. Sweet, malty caramel aroma. Lots of dark fruit and chocolate. An underlying boozy tone. Kinda winey, like it's got some age on it. The flavor starts with sweet, sugary caramel malt. Immediate fruity, plummy notes. Tingly carbonation foams up on the tongue. Thinner bodied than I'd expected, but nothing out of the ordinary for a dubbel or otherwise dark belgian ale. Zesty and phenolic, with spicy yeastiness and an unexpected green apple sourness in the finish. Nicely balancing. Definitely some booze in the swallow, with lingering chocolatey maltiness. Very nice with this NY strip steak."
"This is a drinkable beer with no anoying freaky aftertastes."
"Great label!"
"Drinkability/Overall: Most of y'all reviewers are crazy. This is a damn solid beer. Loads of rich, dark complexity."
"750 ml corked and bailed bottle."
"Ruby-reddish/brown color, with a tan head. Faint malty aroma. Taste is relatively fruity; raisins, plums. Good malt flavor. Strong alcohol presence from the get-go makes it a little harsh, but this is still a very enjoyable dark Belgian. Probably would benefit from some time in the cellar."
"A head and bubbles that left something to be desired. A thick, ruddfy brown and red mix. An alright head on the first pour from my 750 ml bottle, but that was right afterv the pour. My bready head quickly dissipated. The aroma was sweet breads viney malts and yeast. A little toffee and cherries. The first sip is a medium tartness with typical Belgian sweet malts to balance it out. No real noticeable hopping felt on the palate. A little vanillin zucker mixed with very red cherries. A little warmth comes at the finish of this beer for an appropriate take on a very Belgian beer with a little jazz to it."
"Medium aggressive pour leaving decent head, which dissipated and lingers around the edges. Dark coffee brown with serious reddish highlights. This beer smells of bread, chocolate, toffee, some yeast, a hint of cloves maybe, banana bread and plum. The taste is clean and rich with some nice carbonation, not at all heavy. I feeling like Im drinking chocolate banana bread with dark bitter chocolate chips and young banana. The dark fruit character surrounds the edges of the palate, then a tinge of bitterness emerges and finishes with a little residual stickiness. This is a nice B.S.D.A. I wish they had these in four packs so I could keep them around longer. Honestly this goes right up there with Gulden Draak and Maudite. This would be a good staple B.S.D.A. not too crazy or amazing but a fucking solid beer. I will definitely buy this again,"
"I dig it."
"Corked in a 25.4oz bottle with cage. Pours a brown color with red hues and a small head that fades fast and doesn't leave much lacing on the glass. The aroma is mild with a strong grainy character along with a lot of sweetness and a little bit of fruit. The flavor seems a bit harsh with either the dark fruit or the sweetness. Strong graininess comes through as well. Bready and yeasty, but just way too sweet on the finish. The body is fairly full and the drinkability suffers from the harshness and the sweetness."
"A bit hot, a bit sweet. ....out of round."
"D: A good US-made version of a dubbel, certainly worthy of a try. North Coast makes some truly excellent beers; this falls towards the middle of the pack in my opinion. Still, not a lot to quarrel with on this one..."
"Drinkability: Good vs. the style, quite a bit going on and an interesting flavor."
"Overall, very enjoyable and definitely value for money."
"Brother Thelonious pours a dark brown with a thin off white head from brown 750 ml corked and caged bottle. The aroma tends toward the malty side. The flavor has some pear notes, but candy sugar seems to dominate in my opinion. Fairly sweet on the tongue. I couldn't drink a lot of this (I split it with a couple of friends), but I did enjoy it. Definitely worth a try."
"Drinkability: I should make the disclaimer that I find nearly all real beer to be pheonomenally drinkable, so you won't see a lot of scores below 4 in this category in my reviews. This is incredibly smooth, refreshing, and satisfying. You probably wouldn't want to throw down a 6-er during the game, but then again, you're not me, are you?"
"Dark amber pour with a bit of red in it. Good head that dissipated quickly. Smell is rather mild. Malt being predominate. Taste is decent. Usually the North Coast beers are phenomenal but this one is lacking slightly. Tastes of malt, brown sugar, apple and occassionally I get a little tobacco. Doesnt blow me away though. Flavors are weak. Mouthfeel is decent. I am not getting the alcohol so that improves the drinkability factor for a 9% beer. For the price it really isnt a bad but dont know if I will go for it again."
"Medium mouth that could use just a bit more carbonation. This one has promise and might be a better drinker after some time in a cool dark place."
"Mouthfeel is accomodating, soft. My notes for drinkability say ""mmmm. 4"""
"I was under impressed by the bottled version so I decided to give it another go on draft at Mad Mex Robinson during happy hora I figured $2.50 it can't hurt me this time unlike buying the 750ml portion. Appears with no head whatsoever light cream collar of lace is left with each sip though dark ruby brown body. Aroma has light chocolate, raisin, and apple tones with alcohol evident with other over ripened fruits. Taste has a slightly spicy character with a touch of herbal hops, let me say though the flavor is so weak overall diminished by all standards trace of fruit and alcohol very watery presence espeically on draft in bottle I didn't like the way the flavors melded on tap I don't think it's flavorful enough. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied texture is way too light give me something I can bite into like Thelonious's music. Drinkability...I'm not going to bother again support his foundation I guess but this beer doesn't represent the artist or the music very well. Not too many clunkers from North Coast but this one's weak."
"I would definitely buy this again, and hopefully the reports that this will be making it's way to Seattle are true so I can!"
"Pours luminous red-tinged brown. Small film of of-white head with good lacing. Smells darkly fruity and grainy. Alcoholic grapes, plums and a hint of coffee malt in the background. Dry and slightly bitter alcoholic grape flavor up front. Fades quickly to a somewhat acerbic toasted caramel and coffee malt finish. Medium-heavy and sticky body with light carbonation. Pretty peculiar and somewhat lacking for a Belgian-style dark ale."
"Sort of like brother thelonious's music. Classic all the way around but a bit rough around the edges. Straight, no chaser. Really a very good beer though. Right up there with classic belgians like chimay, but just... rougher. Some aging could do it well, but it's still a very nice beer."
"The smell is mostly of dark malts. Some minor esters and yeast comes through too. The taste starts with dark malts and esters, with a bit of alcohol coming through in the end. The mouthfeel is fairly sharp, while drinkability is pretty good."
"Deep and dark translucent burgundy-brown appearance, rock-solid tan head of over 1/2 an inch. Laces in scattered patches. Malty aroma, not particularly yeasty, lots of pears and syrup. Mouthfeel is thick, carbonation lower, giving a nice smooth impression. Flavor works well for my tastes, deeply fruity with a candied sense, approaching a sweeter mincemeat with some tangy and spicey offshoots. The finish is especially nice, chocolate and a full sense without an astringent twang or any fall-off in body. This one works well for me, nice North American rendition, and one of the few examples when I seem to like it MORE than most of the others putting in their thoughts. There is a somewhat odd mothball kind of thing on warming, but its not as bad as that seems or pronounced. The whole Thelonious angle, fine but probably mostly for jazz posers"
"750 ml. This one pours a nice murky dark brown color with orange highlites. There is a light head over top that falls to a patchy coat that stays around nicely. The brew has a light carbonation that works up, and clarity is moderate. The aroma is nice, with a moderate raisin malt, with big spicey notes and some banana esters as well. I'd like to see more maltyness in this one. The flavor is definately dominated with the esters, with the spiceyness associated with the yeast playing second string to this. The dark fruits from the malts are in the background, but still detectable. I was a little overwhelmed by the esters in this bottle. The feel is thick, with a lighter carbonation. It is not too filling though. Overall, this is not a bad beer at all. I have had it on tap and I would take that over the bottle any day, as it didn't seem to have the same estery profile. This is good, but the fruity esters are way too much for me."
"I wasn't terribly impressed with this offering from North Coast. It looked quite nice, pouring a dark bronze red colour with a khaki coloured foamy head. The head stayed around for a long time, and left wonderful, thick lacing on the sides of the glass. Smell was sweet malts, alcohol, and stewed fruit, and in that order. Taste was aggressively sweet, followed by assertive alcohol. In fact, the finish, as well as the taste left in one's mouth several seconds after swallowing a sip, is quite alcoholic. Almost like someone took something like Gulden Draak and put just a pinch of sugar and a half a shot of vodka in it. I think this could benefit from lying down for 15 - 24 months. You could do much worse, and I certainly won't pour it away, but if I buy another, I'll cellar it for sometime."
"The name is a nice memorial, but while the beer is fairly present, I can't help but feel it falls short of where they were aiming. The style itself sets some lofty expectations that many beers meet and exceed, but this one doesn't quite get there. Still, it mostly suffers by comparison. The ABV kicks and is hotly apparent, and serves a minor challenge to the drinkability. So, it's not as otherworldly as its namesake, and while that's to be expected, it's just not up to its name."
"The first sip is delicious, but its hard to polish off the glass. Get a half pint of this one and relish the first few sips  then pass it around to your friends."
"Drinkability: pretty good in my opinion. This abbey ale is a nice version that hits the spot when you are in the mood for the style."
"D- This beer is not really complex or all that interesting for a big beer of this style (Abbey Ale) with 9% alcohol."
"This is quite an interesting take on this Belgian inspired brew. Quite a bit sweeter than many, though in truth I have had quite a few increasingly sweet examples from Belgium, so perhaps I should say it is sweeter than my favorite examples. This does strike a nice richness to it, and is quite an appropriate way to end off an evening of culinary indulgence. This beer hides its strength fairly well. Also it is fairly light despite the sweet fruit character. Certainly an enjoyable tipple and I think I might just need to stash a few of these away to see how they age over time."
"Thanks to nrrd for the bottle!"
"Out of the 750 ml. bomber, and into the St. Bernardus chalice, this Belgian style Abbey Ale poured out deep red. The head however was quite small, and not anything like the overflowing glass that Mr. Thelonious Monk is shown holding on the label. The aroma was a mix of floral and sweet smells, with a hint of spice. It smelled quite strong at first, but after starting the sipping, it became less aromatic. The taste was quite a bit tamer than the real Abbey Ales. I could detect some brow sugar, raisins, and chocolate, but everything was marred by the thin body, and the ever present alcohol. This beer was quite a bit less filling than I was hoping for, and lacked the complexity that the best Belgian style beers exhibit. On the plus side, it was quite easy to drink. In the end this felt like a sweet and alcoholic ale, with little else to remember it by."
"Taste is the same rich tones as the smell. Hint of alcohol, a bit of port. Lots of sour cherry and rich malt. A bit less body than you would expect. More medium bodied than heavy. The flavors don't quite mesh. Maybe with age? Mixed feelings on this one but not a bad Belgian-style American ale."
"Pours a dark brown murky in appearance with a thin tan head. The aroma is brown sugar, cinnamon, cookies, vanilla, malty and fresh. The taste starts syrupy thick, with a pancake syrup sweetness balanced quickly with a bitter hop spiciness that is delicious. This is a quality brew but a little heavy on the sweetness needs more hop balance IMO but good brew overall."
"Drinkability: Are you up for a decent American attempt at a Belgium style? This can be that beer. It will be that beer."
"Pours a dark, red caramel with a half-inch head supported by carbonation. Smell is yeast, malt, cherries..very nice. Taste is a bit sour..cherry-like...alcohol elements..a bit harsher tha expected, expecially with the aromas present. Mouthfeel suffers from the alcohol notes and unexpected tartness. Drinkability also suffers because of the above mentioned characteristics. Not really a great value at $7.99 a bottle. Suggest anything else in the Unibroue line as a substitute."
"Mouthfeel is of a boozy abv punch up front with a sugary candy presense that is enticing at first, leading to a Belgian, sugary yeast that blankets the palate."
"Body is on the big side and feels dense and chewy, not quite the right texture for this style. It has light carbonation and the last glass felt a bit lifeless. A hot bite of alcohol makes this one a sipper. A nice effort from North Coast."
"This beer pours a clear dark red mahogony with a huge tan foamy head. There is a ton of carbonation in this beer. The smell is weak with only abit of candy sugar and malt detectable. The taste is malty with an alcohol presence along with dark fruit and a ""bisquity"" flavor. The m/f is light,but the flavors don't mix all that well. This is a beer that I was disappointed with. I was excited to see this in the store,but it didn't live up to North Coasts usual high standards."
"Drinkability  This is my kind of BSDA. Its big but not gianormous, heavy on the yeast, and goes down smoothly."
"I feel bad for the Thelonious Monk institute of Jazz which is associated with this beer, and only receives $2 for every CASE of this swill sold. I'll finish the bottle, but I won't be trying this again anytime soon."
"A great american effort though, And I will by this one again."
"Quite a pretty brew, ruby colored cola with a creamy eggshell colored head, and fairly nice lacing. Smell is awesome- reminds me quite a bit of Ommegang. Dark fruits, nothing too sweet, with some coffee notes in the background. Fair amount of malts and breadyness. Taste is kind of harsh, alcohol wise. More dark fruits, lots of malts, a bit of roastedness. This just tastes like it might be a bit too young, still a bit too harsh on the alcohol level. Mouthfeel is a bit thin for me, and flat-ish, but chewy enough. Drinkability wise, it's a Belgian, it doesn't suck, but it's just a bit too young..."
"Still, pretty tasty and pretty drinkable. This was a pretty well cared for effort on the part of the brewery."
"Overall: A good Belgian Strong Dark, not the best that I've had, but a solid brew nonetheless."
"Drinkability: This beer has a fair amount going for it and is a good effort on the part of a US brewer to create a dubbel; it could use a bit more depth of flavor and a less harsh finish"
"Final Thoughts: I think it smells and looks better then it tastes. There are better Strong Dark Ales out there. On an interesting note, for every case of this sold, North Coast is donating several dollars to the Thelonious Monk Institute of Jazz. I suppose that's why the price is as high as it is for a disappointing beer like this."
"a good beer, not great, but tasty. I seem to like it more than my review might bear.. a nice one to split between friends with a nice cheese plate, the velvety creaminess of a soft bleu would pair nicely... I dont think fruit could cut this... some bitter chocolate could do the job, but I hate chocolate."
"Large bottle, caged and corked, picked up @ American Bev in BKLYN, NY, I didnt see any freshness indication. Helps support Jazz Music by brewery making a donation for every case purchased. Pours medium brown, cloudy minor tan head, with so so retention, and just a wisp of lacing left. Nose here is milk chocolate and some raisins. Notes of bananas, chocolate, sweet bready malts. A bit on the sweet side, might benefit from some time in the bottle, still tasty and enjoyable, I'm a bit suprised by the low marks for this one, as somebody else noted, this one will benefit from some time to warm up. I'd like to try it with a chocolate dssert."
"Aroma is nice Belgian ale style with raisins and dates and other dark fruits, sweet in its overall neighborhood. Flavor is much the same, nice, but a little too sweet. Considering the alcohol content (which I can feel in the back of my throat, much to my chagrin), it seems like it should be a little better developed than this. Maybe it's just too young. If it could turn some of these sugars into more complexity with time, this could be a really nice, affordable version of the style. Don't get me wrong, enjoyable now, but since I had (in my humble opinion) a world class BSDA recently, this one could use a little more complexity and excitement."
"This is only OK in the drinkability department. I kind of like the chocolate banana flavor but this is just too sweet to drink in any quantity. This would be an awesome dessert beer paired with a banana split."
"Drinkability- After having a Salvation last night I found this one to be another above average example of an american strong dark. Be sure to let it come to room temp first to get the full enjoyment of it. Worth trying. Pretty good job from North Coast."
"Notes: While I love north coast brewing and enjoyed this product on some levels it just seemed like it was all over the map. Once again a fine brew and with some age maybe this will work out better for me, but for today this one didn't make me a mark."
"Overall: Good value at $6.99, but that aside, it has a little harshness in the back end of the taste and too much sweetness, at least when fresh, to be enjoyed to its limits. This has just hit the shelves in SoCal; so perhaps some time in the bottle may diminish the sweetness, given the price its worth taking the chance to see if it does. By the way, I fucking hate Jazz."
"In the end, this is a beer that is so typical of American brewers - it is a misinterpretation of a Belgian... So many American-brewed Belgian-style beers don't have their yeasts pushed to their outer limits, so there's too much residual sugar, insufficient esters, and frequently, insufficient carbonation. Why do they do this? Are American brewers (outside of Vinnie and Tomme) really so cautious?"
"Good stab at a Belgian strong ale by North Coast."
"I was so looking forward to this and this has to be one of the best labels on the planet. It looked great on the pour into my chalice  dark red/amber with lots of noisy bubbles which quickly dissipated. The smell was very light of candi sugar. The taste was  less than spectacular. All the right flavors but way too subtle  candi sugar, raisins and bubble gum. Drinkability and mouthfeel were good which leads me to believe that this needs at least 6 months to come together. Ill open a bottle for Xmas."
"Worth buying for a try and the beautiful label, but not much more than that."
