Served in a tulip, the beer pours a ruby red/copper color with about a half inch light tan head and some sediment floaties noticeable. Head retention and lacing are both good. Aroma is sweet and malty, it smells like dark fruit (raisins, plums), caramel, bready malt, and some brown sugar. The brew tastes like dark fruit (mostly plums), bready malt, caramel, wood, and a slight bitter flavor that I can't identify. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit slick and has good carbonation. I think it's a good brew, I enjoyed it.","bluejacket74","Feb 10, 2012"

The smell was classic belgian, sweet, dark cherries, but hints of caramel, even maybe chocolate, very full and nice bouguet. Maybe even a sherry or bourbon smell as well. Taste was wonderful, dark fruity flavors right up front, apricots, bananas, cherry, a bit of a bready taste and a nice dry finish. The feel was so much lighter tehn I though basedd on appearence, and that is a good thing in this case.

3.12,-15.2,3.5,4,3,1.5,3,"Holy Sheet is pretty nice looking plum/mahogany, with a couple fingers of off-white head. It's not as explosive and frothy as the best Belgian style brews, but it does leave gorgeous sheets of lacing all the way around the glass. Head retention is just short of spectacular though. The nose is absolutely great, sweet dark fruits (very heavy on plum), and some bubble gum, fruity yeast esters. There's also just a hint of brown sugar. There's a big falloff when I take my first sip though, as the combination of the strong malty flavors and sweet fruity esters, without any kind of phenols or hops to balance, give the beer a profound cloying sweetness. This may also be due in part to possibly the worst mouthfeel I've ever encountered on any kind of Belgian style beer. It's noticeably underattenuated, and at the same time the carbonation doesn't have nearly the gusto to cut through it. As a result, the first word that comes to mind is syrupy, and that's diametrically opposite to what I'm looking for. As a drinking experience Holy Sheet is average, but when you're brewing in even a loosely Belgian style you're asking to be compared to some of the finest crafted beers around, and Holy Sheet just isn't on the same level.","axeman9182","Mar 20, 2011"

3,-18.5,3,3,3,3,3,"Very little head, if any, same for the lacing. Red, brown mahogany in color, dark yet equally clear and clean, shade more orange at the rims. The nose comes up with milk chocolate, date and raisin fruit, the alcohol is noticeable, malts not able to smooth out the general volatility, light aspect of candied orange peels, has adequate density but lacks expressivity. Full-bodied, the carbonation does not add much texture nor get the flavors percolating. Hence, it's a bit sticky and more or less sits there as it produces rum raisin cake, date, fig and green apple fruit in addition to mild clove, cinnamon spice. The orange, lemon citrus mutters, touch more clarity to the biscuit and scone elements. Lack of concentration leads to an emptying out feel through the finish. If there's any flaws, would be the noticeability of the alcohol. Otherwise, just a beer that's consumable but misses the general mark.","farrago","Mar 29, 2009"

Heavy carbonation brings a sparkling character to the beer. Aromas are sharply sweet with hints of caramelization, confectionate sugars, heavy esters, and an agressive ethanol scent. Flavors begin with a Dopplebock-like melanoiden caramel and worty-sweet character, along with confectionate sugars that don't attenuate fully. High esters of plumbs, grapes, and bruised fruits swirl around an agressive 'rum-meets-nail-polish-remover' alcohols, making the beer tough to drink. Finishes very alcoholic, hot, and sweet.

Aromatics offer tart raisin and apple notes with some candi sugar and caramelized brown sugar like malt tones, very fruity not much spice noted. Flavor comes off with a trace of metallic funk, super sweet border line syrupy sweet with candi sugar coming off in a bad way. Deep fruits of plum and raisin with evident alcohol notes drowning out most of the other flavors, spices are lacking seems like the yeast strain is in house. It sits really heavy with a rather cloying sweetness that takes over and doesn't let any other component truly shine. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with sticky residual sugars hanging around along with carbonation levels that I consider pretty rough especially for what should be a velvety smooth Abbey style ale.

In the taste, though, the strong vs. nuanced battle is tipped decidedly toward the strong. Very sweet and alcoholic in the way that cough syrup is. I think there was some spice trying to work its way in, but I couldn't drink more than a couple swallows of this. I like hefty Belgian ales, but this one doesn't work for me.

The layer of yeast mentioned on the neck label never got loose from its dwelling at the bottom of the sea and showed up in my goblet. The aroma was spicy, warm, and malty, but the lack of earthiness gave this away from being a true Belgian beer. The taste was fruity to brim with the rum soaked raisins, red cherries, and candied apples showing up on the tongue. Unfortunately the alcohol was bracing hot, and there was not enough complexity to mask it. If the yeast had been allowed to dry the mouthfeel some more, the beer would have turned out more charming.

Date syrup and unrefined sugar flavors emerge; then the semi-dry aftertaste reveals a smooth alcohol taste, Goldings or other mild english flavor hop notes, and a balancing bitterness. The carbonation is actually quite low- but extremely smooth. The body is medium and the lack of crispness allows a malt-centric mouthfeel with robust fruit and booze tones to hang around. Finishes a little hot with plenty of residual caramel and beet sugar; but the velvety mouthfeel alone warrents a respectable drinkability.
