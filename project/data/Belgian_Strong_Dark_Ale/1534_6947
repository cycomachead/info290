Getting a real nutty flavor mixed with dark fruits, a bit sweet. The feel isn't really full and while good, it ends a bit too abrupt.

The beer is dark drown and mostly clear with sediment coming with later (or less gentle) pours. Aroma contains raisins, fig, caramel, cherries, and alcohol. Taste is sweet with molasses, candi sugar, dark fruits, and raisins. There is some spicy and mildly hoppy bitterness as well. Certainly a boozy burn on the swallow, but it doesnâ€™t detract. Medium-full body, lots of creamy carbonation, creamy texture, semi-dry finish that allows the residual sugars to leave their mark.","SierraFlight","Feb 17, 2015"

Unfortunately the bottle was already opened a while before I drank of it, which compromised the taste a bit, especially the aftertaste.

The mouthfeel is spectacular: lightly carbonated for the style but nonetheless with a lingering effervescence that I found unusual, and quite pleasing. The dark fruits, banana, and yeast are there with a mild sweetness that just manages to stop short of being too upfront.  The higher alcohol content is virtually unnoticeable. This is a spectacular BSDA that is a must try for anyone who is a fan of the style, or just anyone.","JasW","Jan 05, 2015"

That was the best part of this beer. After that all I could smell and taste was sweetness. It's like the brewer took tons of sugar and mixed it with a pound of yeast and hops. A lot of these reciews say to age for 4 years before it becomes good. But why would you want to buy a beer you have to age that long before it becomes good. To me if they would have lowered the sweetness it could have been much better.","mlhyatt","Aug 13, 2014"

The flavours are quite bold and the sweetness can border on cloying at times, with the high alcohol content being immediately noticeable. That being said - none of those are necessarily deal-breakers in this style, and it's probably my fault for cracking open such a young bottle anyway. This is a very solid Belgian strong dark ale that is worth seeking out for cellaring purposes. I know I'll be on the lookout for it, especially if the price remains so staggeringly low - $7.80 for a high-quality 11% Belgian beer is a virtual steal!","thehyperduck","Mar 31, 2014"

If you are into cellaring beer, this is certainly one to try, and I'm sure a vertical project would be a very enjoyable experiment.

The aroma brings a delicate but sweet currant and red wine theme with dark fruits. Very refined with none of the classic Belgian traits I often expect. Very nice but definitely concentrated on the wine idea. The flavor hits with more dark fruits over deep chocolate malt and champagne - red wine. There are some floral hints and cotton candy sweetness, but again, the dominant flavor combines red wine and sugary malt. The body is at least medium with modest carbonation and a pretty aqueous feel. Quite a tasty treat worth waiting for!!","Durge","Nov 18, 2013"

A rocky head that persists all the way threw, sticking to the glass as you drink. Not the best smelling brew. Not a foul smell just not much to it. Heavy booze not with the slight fruity esters of Belgium yeast and not much else. Fortunately this does not translate over to taste. A taste of booze fruity esters, darkfruits , candy sugers . the mouth feel is smooth and velvety like an imperial stout. The carbonation seams to only add to head retention and does not dull the flavor at all. Trying to broaden my Belgium horizons, not a dad addition","Mrappinin","Sep 16, 2013"

4.42,2.8,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"750 ml bottle into tulip glass, 2010 vintage. Pours moderately hazy and cloudy dark reddish brown color with a 2 finger fairly dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Good spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of big caramel, raisin, plum, fig, molasses, toast, toffee, brown sugar, dark bread, dark candi sugar, pepper, light clove, light chocolate, light roast, and yeast earthiness. Fantastic aromas with huge complexity and great balance of dark malt and fruity/spicy yeast esters; with big strength. Taste of caramel, molasses, toast, raisin, prune, fig, brown sugar, toffee, dark bread, light chocolate, herbal, light roast, and yeast earthiness. Lingering notes of caramel, molasses, toast, brown sugar, toffee, raisin, prune, dark bread, light chocolate, light roast, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a while. Absolutely incredible complexity and balance of molasses/bready malt and dark fruit flavors; with a big malt presence and zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Light-medium carbonation and full bodied; with a creamy, slick, and lightly crisp mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a small warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is an absolutely incredible Belgian strong dark ale! All around incredible balance and complexity of dark malt and dark fruit flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the gravity. An insanely delicious offering.","superspak","Aug 03, 2013"

4.12,-4.2,4,4.5,4,4,4,"This beer is monstrous and rich, very heavy, and definitely a sipper. It's almost overwhelmingly rich and flavorful and borders on being just a tad too much. It's very sweet and will not appeal to fans of dryer, more tart, or hoppier beers because of this. However, it is quite good for what it is and I am going to thoroughly enjoy this experience. However, there are a number of other Belgian ales in this class that I think balance their flavors a little better.","Cylinsier","Aug 15, 2012"

Nice off-white one finger head with good retention and lacing. Aroma of dark and caramel malt, dark and dried fruit, slight cherry and a hint of Belgian spicing. Flavor is intense dark and dried fruits, caramel malt and delicious light tartness with fruits dominating middle and finish with slight hops in the finish. A bit on the sweet side, but the complex flavor carries this ale through. Medium to heavy bodied with some creaminess. A very nice dark Belgian.","LiquidAmber","Aug 01, 2012"

4.22,-1.9,4,4.5,4,4,4.5,"The feel is less appealing than the taste which carries a nice spice flavor with gentle cinnamon and come cocoa from the malt which also provides a light biscuit element and a mild flavor of apple from the yeast with mild molasses tinges and slight grainy flavor with some dark sugar notes in the the later sips as it nears cellar temperature. The flavor becomes more alcoholic and spicy as it warms with some slight cedar elements and mild medicinal tinges which augment the deep molassess quality from the malt. I enjoyed this -it was certainly a nightcap beer for me -the intensity at 11% makes that seem a reasonable statement and it displays some of the abv in the flavor and aroma which detracts from an otherwise top quality quad.","Slatetank","Aug 14, 2011"

The taste of the beer gets better as it warms up, it had some really nice spices in there that mixed well with the malts.

The head is thin but long lasting. There is an enticing balance of sweet malts and a zing of hops on the nose. The body ends up at about medium to good. As for the taste think of smooth candied sweetness and a slightly harsher finish to remind you of what you have just experienced. Very drinkable in the end.","puboflyons","Aug 02, 2011"

The malts come out in full force in the aroma, complete with a dry woodiness/nutty yeastiness and there is a minor sweet touch and some fruit flavors I pick up. Smooth, medium-bodied, almost creamy mouthfeel that makes for an easy to drink brew. I pick up tart fruit like cherry and something akin to apple or plum and also a touch of citric like orange. Also a good deal of residual sticky sweet malt. Caramel, figs, possibly chocolate (possibly) - no matter there is some definite sugary goodness in here and it is balanced w/ the fruits and combines with the yeast for a sweet and also dry (also bready) malt balance. Lots going on and then it finishes real crisp, not due to ABV which is well-hidden, but due to some minor clove and pepper spices. All in all a fruity, sweet and dry ale that doesn't taste heavy and is a dangerously great sipper.","clayrock81","May 06, 2011"

The dark fruit is overlain with dark roasted malts. Sweet but not quite syrupy. The alcohol peppered the profile and provided ample warmth.

Glass is coated sticky lacing and overall has nice retention but eventually fades a large bubbly cap. At cooler temperatures the aroma is rich with dark fruits, yeast, sugars, etc and is very pleasant but as it warms up the alcohol dominates and detracts from the nose. The mouthfeel is my favorite part of this beer. Medium full, silky with light carbonation and a rich, sweet fruity finish. Like the nose, the flavors become dominated by alcohol as this beer warms up. Even when cold, flavors are dominated by ripe, dark fruits, sugars, caramel malt, light spices, occasionally tart and all of these flavors are intensified as it warms up. Overall, an amazing Belgian, probably should have let this sit a little longer and a little too sweet for my own personal tastes, but the amazing mouthfeel and carbonation nearly makes up for those points.","yourefragile","Dec 17, 2009"

Taste is similar to the aroma, but there's also some booze and licorice noticable. But like the aroma, the dark fruit taste is the strongest compared to the other flavors. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit creamy and coating and has moderate carbonation. Drinkability is good, it's easy to drink and goes down smooth.

This beer pours with a deep caramel color and golden tan head with aromas plums, raisins and wood leaping out of the glass. The palate starts of with sweet caramel that soon gives way to fruity flavors of figs and plums with a slight tart quality. The finish is long and mouth filling as the Belgium hops flex their muscles making it both sweet and bitter at the same time.

The sweetness in the nose is consistent and stays within bounds, mix of poached apricots, maraschino cherry, golden raisins, caramelized brown sugar, glazed nuts and cinnamon stick, looks more for balance and follow-through than any one big thrust. Full-bodied, there's a broad, creamy foaminess to support the concentration and prevent heaviness. Here the caramel, molasses, brown sugar leads clearly into the cherry, apricot, peach, pear fruit, less emphasis on raisin or fig. At times you get banana notes.

A very rich, thick beer with those layers of complexity that you love to feel. A bit spicy at the end. Chewy, yet super smooth, and it just loves to roll off the tongue. Pretty high carbonation for the style. Drinkability is high because of the above, but I also think it's a bit boozey, and that detracts a bit.

2.02,-53,4,2,1.5,4,1.5,"I poured this (newer label) 2008 beer into a Chimay goblet. It looked enticing, but the aroma wasn't very good. As I inhaled, I detected some phenols that weren't pleasant. Upon the first sip, the funky phenols came into play. Now, the funkiness wasn't like a Lambic or red/brown Flanders ale with a ""good"" funkiness. This funkiness wasn't acerbic, but it was a bad funkiness that rested lightly in the background of the more dominant candy sweetness of this brew. The bad characteristics reminded me of a mix of: hints of Testors Glue, some sweaty neoprene, perhaps some ""new tire", and/or wisps of unwanted phenols (like when some American breweries let a German weizen yeast get totally out of control). All of this is then wrapped up in a dominating sugary sweet glaze. Sound appetizing? It wasn't, and I ended up doing a drain-pour. I've had this one on a couple of occasions in the past and thought I remembered it being pretty good, but this latest bottle has discouraged me from buying this brew again. I know sometimes a person's tastes and preferences change, but I don't see how they could have changed *that* much with me and this brew. I don't know...maybe this is a brew that just needs lots of aging before it becomes drinkable, and I've only had aged versions in the past? Now that I think about it, I've had some brews with perfectly ""good"" phenolics which were aged, and those characteristics sadly disappeared. I think this is a brew which needs some age so that the ""bad"" phenols will disappear. I bet that's why I liked the aged versions of this brew I had in the past. Whatever the case, and whatever vintage you might find of this brew, hopefully you'll like it...and I still have hope that it can be a good brew.","ohmybock","Mar 31, 2009"

As I pored the dark concoction into my glass it seemed thicker than I expected, almost like a stout. There was very little head but it was a very nice tan that left plenty of lacing. Here's where it went downhill. The aroma... full of raisin and fig and brown sugar. All kinds of maltiness. Usually that's the start of something good, but it was overwhelming. Too sweet. The flavor was once again too sweet. Just a thick mouthful of sugary raisin-like liquid. No hops what-so-ever. No underlying teaser of complex flavors inherent to Belgian beers. It was lightly carbonated and very creamy. But in the end I begrudgingly poured the rest down the drain.","soultrain19","Nov 02, 2008"

Lots of sherry and dried fruit flavors but not as rich as is needed to tone down the 10% abv. If this beer was about 6 or 7% it would be awesome, but the alcohol is just too potent.

Outstanding aroma, at times there are some classic Belgian qualities while at others it is like a nice aged English barleywine, sweet and malty.

Still some hoppiness in this vintage with some hints of crispness mixing with a bite of the alcohol strength. Medium to heavy in body, carbonation is low, but soft and creamy where present.

The lace graced the glass deep into the session. And the aroma ! Sweet, candied sugar with an alcohol accent. Dates, raisens and prunes rose from the glass and again presented themselves in the taste. The candied sugar was highly evident along with hints of cinnamon. Mind you, the aroma and flavor were balanced with sweet overtones, but the sweetness did not overwhelm either. A warm, alcohol presence with explosions of flavor with each sip. The mouthfeel was thick and chewy, precisely what makes for a wonderful strong brown belgian. This is a highly drinkable session brew that the Belgian fan will absoultely savor. It is also added to my personal favorites list.","jim102864","Mar 24, 2007"

The first sip absolutely knocked my socks off, it was likely the best sip of beer I've ever had. After that, for some reason, it wasn't quite as good, albeit still very enjoyable.

Toffee and honey sweetness hit my palate right away, evening out into a more fruity middle with prunes and plums taking over. A little spicy as well, but very subdued. Bready towards the end, it finished with lingering earthy raisins, caramel and soft alcohol. Medium to full bodied, the carbonation was well integrated and supported the near syrupy texture.

Lots of sticky web-like lacing as snifter drains. Incredibly rich, intense aromas of brandy-soaked dried dark friuts, plums, cherries, brown sugar, bubblegum and oak all amped up by a big alcohol punch. Mouthfeel is well balanced; smooth, full and silky with a pleasant spritzy carbonation. Big and round for a 10%Â’er. Flavors very similar to the nose. Head spiningly sweet intense notes of brandy soaked black cherries, raisins, figs, caramel and plums. Just a hint of anise, wood and spice in the background. The 10% abv comes to the rescue here with a faint hop presence to prevent this superb Belgian from becoming too cloyingly sweet.

Flavor is powerfully full of fruity esters of raisins, sour cherry, and pomegranates. Deeply malty with caramel and honey.

4.5,4.7,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Purchased at Sam's the bottles says 2005. Poured into a chalice a hazy dark brown with warm red high lights. The head rises to a nice thickness and then slowly dissipates to a point and lingers, leaving lacing all around. It smells predominantly of sweet malts, candied apples, or even the smell of a half eaten apple set out a while (which honestly is nice because the sugars come more forward) brown sugar, figs, caramel, bread and minor toasted notes. For me some of the fruit esters really come into their own and then fall back on old, but excellent standards. The taste is sweet with mildly bitter caramel notes, then some brown sugar onto a slightly carbonated taste of banana, apple bread. The drink finishes with a mellow cooked green apple flavor coupled with well-balanced raison and supportively helpful hops. The mouthful is nice on this one. Honestly the 11%abv was not present in the smell, but has come to full strength after the beverages was imbibed. This is a wickedly strong, yet tasty brew, totally Belgium and kick ass in a very pleasing way. Its like every sip evokes a history and intoxicates me all the more.

The two most dominant tastes are of the aforementioned alcohol and candied fruits, but the amount of carbonation makes it so neither one can take hold on your tongue and leaves you begging for more.

Although great care was exercised in not shaking the bottle during the uncaging and uncorking ceremony, I still found a gusher in my hand that lost about an ounce of liquid on the desktop. I had never seen a beer form a head in the bottle before this one. The body was deep burgundy in color and after the initial rush of carbonation; there was little head to speak of. The beer looked cloudy in the wine glass, while little light coming through. The bouquet was rich and layered with aromas of fig, plum, raisin, toffee, chocolate, and maple. The malt also presented itself on the tongue as a sweet and warm taste reminiscent of port wine. Alcohol was not as well hidden as I though it would be, with distinct warmth that was pleasing. Not much to counter the sweetness, as there was hardly any hop presence. The beer was smooth and slippery on the palette with a prickly, peppery, and alcoholic aftertaste. Two years of aging was not enough, as the rough edges were still a little grating. Can do better with eight more years I think.","rajendra82","Feb 23, 2006"

Hoppier than the average dark Belgian ale, but not overly hopped. The hops lend a welcomed bitterness to this otherwise sweet beer. Thick mouthfeel.

The taste is a bit hot with this young example, but this is only a small hindrence. The spices mingle well with the clean malts and hops and the alcohol, whilst hot, is warming and pulls this one together.

And to think that the first time I ever had this beer was, in Scranton, Pa., three months after coming home from Europe. Hopefully, I will tour Europe again this year. I have got to try this, if available, in it's home town. I had this on tap after the keg traveled 3500 miles and it was incredible. I can only imagine how good it must be in Belgium. This brew IS fit for a king! Complex, to say the least. Banana, brown sugar, vanilla, homemade bread, plum, sweet, and malty. A very light head sits on top of the lightly carbonated reddish/brown liquid and laces till the very end. As with most Belgian browns, I took my time and let it warm a bit. The taste and the aroma just explode. One sip yielding banana, the next, maybe some rum and so on, till the very end. The high abv isn't really hidden in this one but your taste buds and olfactory glands are working overtime, leaving little time to worry about alcohol. After two half liter chalices, I was ready to call myself king. Instead I called the bartender and had one more. I gave this a 4.5 on drinkability only because of it's sweet taste. (It's similar to a Kasteel Brune a far as sweetness.) That, not the 11% abv, only prevented me from having anymore than I did at one sitting. I went back a few days later only to learn that the Carolus had kicked. Since their tap stock is rotated I will have to wait some time before they have this on tap again.

Full bodied, with seemingly mild carbonation. Beutiful for sipping, though I would certainly pair this with some big cuts of beef, game, barbecue, and really strong cheeses.

Aroma is quite port-like sweet with strong malt also noticeable.

Body is quite full and alcohol is not discernable which I always appreciate.

The taste is equally pruney and medicinal, how I'd like my Geritol to be when and if I get to that stage in life :). Light chocolate reminiscence as it warms. Slight sweet/sour finish. Lower carbonation level is perfect for a ""nightcap"" type of beer that this is. Mouthfeel is nice, slick on the tongue.

The taste was an amalgam of sweet malt, spices, and fruit with just a hint of hops and alcohol at the end. The spices appeared to be some sage and perhaps basil with some citrus fruitiness. The beer is a nice thick bodied beer with a lingering sweetness that is very pleasant, but drunk in too much quantity could become cloying.

Alcohol scent present, with some noticeable yeasty sweet aromas. The taste is initially fruity yeast that is very light on the tongue due to the incredible carbonation. Alcohol is present thoughout, with a woodsy flavor appearing. No bitterness - hops hardly discernable. The aftertase is smooth, light and malty.

4.42,2.8,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Murky, chestnut red in hue with strong brown influences, the color has great depth and is very attractive. A smallish beige head reached a sad half finger in height, the head retention was poor and it quickly dissipated to a sparse, bubbly cap. The subsequent lacing was almost zilch. This aspect of the beer is disappointing. The nose is awesome, great potency, alcoholic black licorices upfront, supple warm maltiness follows, lots of plums and soft grape notes, figs, raisins, a bit of raw rubbing alcohol too but it is largely rounded and blended perfectly with a yeasty spice. IÂ’m in love with the nose, there is so much going on yet every aroma has a voice and I like what it is saying. It is time to drink-up! Upfront the palate is momentarily empty, I could sense the flavor sensation ready to explode but for a brief moment there was anticipation, a pause, it was like Christmas morning as a kid. Man, I knew this was going to be good! And then it happened, I swallowed this nectar and I finally tasted it! At first it was very peppery, clovey, green grape skins, citrus zest, rubbing alcohol, a bit of spiced rum, juicy maltiness, and caddied sugar. This beer is just a puppy, it has bite and it could use some maturing but I really like it Â“as is.Â” I do think the mouthfeel is a little too empty; it is a little over-carbonated yet I canÂ’t downgrade it that much. Maybe I am nitpicking. This is a lovely beer, very drinkable and very wantable; I bought a 750ml corked-and-caged bottle in Lincoln a few months ago. Sadly, the last time I checked there was no more. Damn. If you see it, buy it, and then enjoy it. Recommended.","bditty187","Mar 17, 2004"

Quite spicy as well as you'd expect from a belgian grand cru (herbal thyme and sage), lots of fruits (orange, lemon peel). Just a big malty nose altogether with restrained dusty yeastiness. As it warms, it acquires a powdery chocolate feel as well. In mouth, it's still very sweet, with more alcohol than I expected, vious candi sugar. Lots of malty flavours to decorticate: mint, grapes, orange with floral qualities... Aftertaste is long and made me think of a banana split with touches of alcohol and licorice.

Pours a muddy reddish brown color with basically no head and little lacing. Lots of floating yeast sediment in the beer. But the nose on it is terrific. Lots of sweet maltiness. The initial taste backs up the nose. Plums and raisins combined with a hit of sharp carbonation. But this follows with a buttery diacetyl taste that starts out nice but eventually becomes too sharp and ends up tasting like scotch. Finish is dry and yeasty with some more raisiny sweetness and it lingered for a long, long time. Good, but I couldn't drink too many of these.

Vinous waft of sherryish fruit upfront in aroma tapers, allowing sugary dark caramel and clove to emerge. Hint of must and butter. Mellow banana esters surface as the beer breathes. Functional, but not overly enticing aromawise. Mild honey like sweetness hits the palate initially, then yields to a bitterish melange of bread crust and powdered baker's chocolate. Sweetness then resumes, this time of a clean, molasses tinged dark caramel nature. Herbal, clove phenol appears late, and detracts from the malt character, which had almost developed into a rich, carob undertone. Lightly bodied and well attenuated, but the paltry hop bitterness leaves overall balance well skewed towards malt sweetness. Finishes with a snap of clove laced sweetness, but otherwise dry and clean. It's certainly a flavorful brew, but residual and caramel malt derived sweetness clashed somewhat with the phenols, thus preventing greatness. This bottle was quite young. Definitely a beer worthy of cellaring.","marc77","Nov 27, 2002"

Finish is potently acidic with the hops being apropos to the style, quite dry aftertaste. The high ABV, warms the tummy, and adds that just right character to the beer. I could not wait to sample this beer, but I have two more to age away as recommended.
