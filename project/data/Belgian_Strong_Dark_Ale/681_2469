3.5,-17.1,,,,,,"Warm, toasted malts at the beginning, which turn more present and sweeter at the same time. Carbonation is lively, vanishes soon, due to the intense malts. Interesting development on the palate, as the beer starts earthy, bready with hints of wood and rather dry, the malt needs a second to turn sweet and warming, with hints of fruit and also spices. Almost too sweet aftertaste, sticky. Refreshing at first, loosing its carbonation to the sweetness. Complex beer with a decent body, defined by malts, with an unusual high carbonation.","aleigator","Oct 29, 2014"

Smell - toasted malt, dark fruit, brown sugar, yeast. Taste - begins yeasty sweet, followed by dark fruit, raisins, plums, figs, after that an intensifying toastiness. Ending dry with a slight hop bitterness. The aftertaste comes up after a while with roasty coffee and chocolate, lasting for a long time. Medium full body, medium-high soft carbonation, ample creamy mouthfeel. Overall a fine sipping beer; a soft, flavorful and complex taste.

3.89,-7.8,3.5,3.75,4,3.75,4,"this is the beer i think of when i think of belgian browns, its just awesome, so big yet elegant, and really unique. the pour is a little off putting, i can see that, so much yeast floating around in here, chunky and never really settling out beneath the thick off white head. the beer itself, aside from the yeast pieces, as actually rather clear, caramel colored, and full bodied. a nose of melting sugar, belgian strong ale yeast, and just layers of sweet grain, with more caramel and toffee character than toast, and an invisible alcohol content. extremely appetizing. the taste is similar, with the sweetness lasting all the way though, but never being too much. they yeast is dialed in too, not in your face or real estery, just mature and distinctly belgian. a great burnt sugar finish with the yeast develops, and the beer is long on the tongue after the swallow. a little lighter than most browns, more in that copper range, but certainly not left wanting for more grain complexion on this beer. easier drinking too for what it is, on coarseness from the alcohol at all. the only critique for me is all this yeast, and i know the beer has a little age and its common for the style, but even the mouthfeel is a little granular, chunky, textured. its too much, i dont want to chew yeast bits in my beer, but its necessary, especially as the bottle pours down. not enough to turn me off though, this is great stuff.","StonedTrippin","Jun 05, 2014"

4.32,2.4,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"750 ml bottle into chalice, best before 2/12/2013. Pours moderately cloudy reddish brown color with a nice 2 finger fairly dense and fluffy cream colored head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty foamy lacing clings on the glass, with plenty of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of big raisin, prune, fig, apple, caramel, molasses, toast, toffee, brown bread, pepper, light clove, and earthy yeast spiciness. Incredible aromas with big complexity and great balance of dark malt and fruity/spicy yeast ester notes; with good strength. Taste of raisin, fig, prune, apple, caramel, molasses, toast, toffee, pepper, light clove, brown bread, and yeast earthiness. Lingering notes of light and dark fruits, caramel, molasses, toast, toffee, brown bread, pepper, light clove, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a while. Fantastic complexity of malt and spicy/fruity yeast esters; with a great balance of malt/spiciness and no cloying flavors after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a creamy, slick, and moderately prickly mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a fantastic Belgian strong dark ale! Great complexity and balance of malt and fruity/spicy yeast esters; and very smooth to sip on. A highly enjoyable offering.","superspak","Apr 20, 2013"

4.17,-1.2,3.5,4,4.5,4,4,"Abbaye des Rocs Brune pours a deep ruby red, lightening a bit around the edges. Three fingers or so of khaki colored foam come together to cap the beer. Head retention is just alright, and lacing is minimal. The nose is very nice, redolent of candied dark fruits with just a little bit of a gentle alcohol aroma present as well. The flavor leads off with the same fruity presence from the nose. It's not all plum, as there's plenty of raisin and other dark fruits, and there's an undercurrent of sweetness running through them all. The warming booziness that comes in mid palate transitions beautifully into a lightly intense clove finish. The body is well dried out, this beer would serve as an excellent example to show someone that final gravity does not necessarily correlate with sweetness in a beer. There's a little bit of a spark to the carbonation, but for my taste it could stand to have even a little more kick. A beer like Abbaye des Rocs Brune is why I like being in a BotM program. I might never have picked up a bottle of this on my own, but it's a pretty great Belgian Strong Dark Ale.","axeman9182","Sep 14, 2012"

The bartender had then brought out the bottle of Des Rocs for me and started pouring it out. I asked what it was, he said it was a Dark Belgian Strong ale that they had just gotten in. He told me it was on the house for being a such good customer to them all the time. I thanked him and proceeded to enjoy this beer to it's fullest. The beer poured out as a really nice brown color with a tan foamy head. The lacing was pretty good on the glass. The aromas of brown sugar and dark fruits flooded my nose, there was also some yeasty aroma in there and some fresh wood also. The aromas were all very well balanced. The taste of the beer was lightly roasted, the sweetness upfront from the fruits carried over into the caramel wooden aftetaste. The mouthfeel was elegantly smooth and very eacy to drink. Overall I found this beer to be very good on just about every level. I'd love to have it again one day.","Knapp85","May 26, 2011"

From the first second of the tasting up to the last, the texture remains moderate, but quite "a mouthful" still, as it goes neither thin nor cloying.

Finishes bland and semi-metallic, with no aftertaste from either hops or yeast. Mouthfeel is nicely carbonated, but the medium body takes on a syrupy, sticky-sweet consistency that disagrees with my palate.

Actually I don't really appreciate the cough syrup, but it's there in the Abbaye des Rocs beers I've tried, and several other breweries too (Gouden Carolus, even very aged St Sixtus ABT 12).

Adequately carbonated, there is an immediate tingle of hops and alcohol. A little unsettling, the suspended particles actually have a pulp-like presence in the mouth (not expected or desired...a tad scary). Full flavored, the taste is i sweet figgy dark fruit and molasses, but its on the light side as opposed to being thick feeling. The 9% ABV is blended well. The drinkability suffers due to the irregular texture from the sediment. The rest is hype...something can be said for Quality Control and consistency.","jjayjaye","Nov 24, 2007"

Yeast gives the beer a nice chewy bread backbone that keeps all the sweetness in check. The alcohol, whole just ever-so-slightly noticeable, provides further balance. Nice full maouthfeel that just allows this beer to slide past the palate into the throat. THen it wafts up to the back of the nose to some fruity esthers. Would be a great dinner beer.

The taste is initially sweet, but quickly shifts to a lingering, dry bitterness. I find it hard to describe the middle, but it seems to have a dark breadiness, or perhaps sourdough hiding in there. There seems to be some complexity that I can't describe. My distinguished associate, Br. Forner, describes the taste as "church wine."

The aroma was very malty and caramelly, with a hint of hop spiciness. Taste was damn good. Very malty and chocolatey with hints of spice, dark fruits and maple syrup.

Lots of prune and raisin smells. Some roastyness and chocolate. Some vanilla. A bit sherry like. Again good prune and raisin flavors. Brown sugar and dark candy flavors. Slightly alcoholic but still well hidden for 9%. I have to score low on the mouthfeel due to the sediment. You can feel the solid "chunks" in your mouth and that is just a turn off to me.

The bottle really pissed me off. Upon poping the top, it's gushing made a mess of the counter top. I managed to pour a goblet and sat down to drink. Upon returning, the half-full bottle continued to cascade over the top and created, yet another mess. After that, good beer! Malty, prune-sy, raisons, woodsy, vineous, tart, spicy, and lightly barnyard-ey and leathery. Moderately full and rich with a less-thn-thick feel. Carbonation gives way to a smooth, tart finish.

Taste starts with sweet caramel , some dark ripe fruits and more of the sugary sweetness. Nice bit of spice cuts through the sweetness towards the middle.

The aroma consists of caramel, molasses, sweetness, fruits (plum? apple?), raisins, green hops?, carob?, and yeast. It has a medium to thick body with winey, fruity malts, mild hops, yeast, a medium bitterness, and some suggestions of the aroma.

Nose is all spicy malt and Belgian yeast. Dark fruits and candi sneak through. Taste, and maybe it's the power of suggestion here, but is does have a brown ale flavor done in a Belgian way. The Belgian in it is the fruity, spicy kick, the dry middle, and the luscious long finish. I wish the mouthfeel was just a touch fuller. It's good, but this particular one could be improved.

Personally speaking, a mild allergic reaction also limits it's drinkability. Considering the rave reviews, I'm glad I've tried it.

Not as "burgundian" as some in the style (notably Ommegang's), but that is not a bad thing - rather than tasting like a malty red wine, this was much more sophisitcated and well mannered - like beer that had been fermented in a red wine cask. Quite mellow for the style, with the abv hiding below the surface.

Medium-sized spongy tan head, it leaves a thin cap all the way down the glass. Very fruity aroma, raisins, dried dates and currents, ripe papaya, and some vinuous white grape as well. Rich malt beneath all of that, I'm even picking up some brown sugar and chocolate. Intense brown sugary malt at first, sour cherry, treacle and some brandy alcohol in the middle, the flavour starts to become a bit sour towards the finish where all the more fruity esters start making an appearance. For me the aftertaste is predominated by dates and black currents. Incredibly full and creamy rich mouthfeel, yet light and fluffy as well in parts.

The taste is lightly sweet, fruity, with perhaps a hint of sherry. The fruity notes are reminiscent of sour plum and apricot. Quite a bit of musty cobweb type notes going on here as well.

3.88,-8.1,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Poured from a 750ml bottle into a Tripel Karmeliet glass, with an ample tan head rising up and settling to leave thick blanketing lacing behind. The color was ruby-orange, and with large flakes of precipitate swirling around the cloudy liquid with vigor. The smell was...curious. The earthy spice aroma had components of anise, beef jerky or Slim Jim, and a slew of spices I was not able to decipher. Taste...the beer had a light malt backbone with heaping accents of molasses, cane sugar, nutmeg, rum, and coriander seed, finishing rather dry with a satisfying bitterness...quite delicious. The mouthfeel was right...full, smooth, and a bit fluffy. All in all an innovative and enjoyable beer.","HiroProtagonist","Jan 12, 2004"
4.75,12.6,4.5,4.5,5,4,5,"33cl brown bottle. Pours into a Belgian goblet a ruby hued cherry wood colour. Quite impressive. Healthy beige head with patchy sheet lacing. Aroma is interesting. Freshly tanned leather, a new aroma to me, is apparent. Apple molasses, served with cinnamon butter, on banana bread is the taste I'm getting, as well as the aroma. Fascinating! Toffee and caramel also jump into the profile.Mouthfeel is medium bodied, and is appropriately carbonated. Taste has some of the best malt notes I've ever experienced. This one will proudly reside in my top ten. Very similar to a Rochefort 10.","merlin48","Jan 09, 2004"
4.47,5.9,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"A wine-like finishing beer. Excellent. One mate wanted more aftertaste. Orange brown. Complementing mix of Hops and malts and spicy cinammon works and worth paying for. Buy the right glass for this classic. Orange and candy sweetness. Alcohol basically hidden.","Sammy","Dec 12, 2003"
4.12,-2.4,3.5,4,4,4.5,4.5,"Pours an almost clear amber witha thick head that settled down quickly. Has huge yeast sediment chunks floating everywhere in the glass. Aroma is a strong fruity one with hints of plums that also is a bit musty smelling. Mouthfeel is full and smooth with a nice crisp effervescent feel. Flavor is much like the aroma. Fruity and malty with a nice yeasty flavor as well. Alcohol is unnoticable in both aroma and flavor. Overall a fine Belgian ale.","BierReise","Dec 11, 2003"
4.72,11.8,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,5,"Pours with a big light brown frothy head and lots of large bubbles around the outside of the glass. Clear reddish brown in color with some bubbles rising to the surface. The head slowly recedes to a thick frothy lace. The nose is quite heavy with all sorts of aromas. Dark fruits, vinous notes, oak, brown sugar, and a hint of cherry are all noticeable. I can keep my nose to the glass for ages. Tons of flavors on the palate. I cant believe that this one is 9% ABV. The drinkability is outstanding. The start is slightly bread with good malt tons. Fruitiness of plums and raisins along with some cherry hints stand out. Vinous flavors are apparent (port wine?) with oak notes that sneak in toward the end. The finish is slightly warming. Spices are present, but to a much lesser degree then other Belgian Ales. No worries though. This is an absolutely wonderful brew, that probably couldnt be better if it tried. So many flavors and aromas all melding together perfectly.","byrd","Dec 07, 2003"
3.31,-21.6,4.5,3.5,3,4,3,"Smooth and easy mouthfeel is very nice. But seriously, this is not one Id necessarily go back to. Had the exact same experience with their Grand Cru. This never tastes that good, ever, no matter how many times I've tried their beers. The hops are nasty and overtake your mouth in the finish and the malt has little character. Maybe their results are inconsistent like Dogfish Head, because none of the charming scents and flavors are found in their beers when I drink them. Flat malt, doughy yeast, and distasteful hops. I love a delicate and subtle beer, but I'm catching none of what everyone else is heralding, only lackluster versions of what they're describing (i.e. spices, fruits, wine, etc.)","nomad","Dec 05, 2003"

Poured out of a 33cl bottle with a nice head and deep brownish-red color, the smell was incredible. Chocolaty and malty with a spicy tinge to it. The first sip was incredible. Unbelievably balanced for a beer with such a high ABV. It was like having all the best characteristics of every belgian beer you've had rolled into one: Chocolate, Coffee, Fruit, Wine... All in perfect balance. A very warming beer, Do yourself a favor and go get some of this today.","ChrisBowers","Nov 20, 2003"

4.45,5.5,4,4,4.5,4.5,5,"750 ml green bottle that's capped and corked. Pours a clear copper with an unsustainable light tan head. Aroma consists of apples, candied raisins, malt, some spiciness and alcohol. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied and smooth with an effervescent crispness around the edges. Very nice. Initial taste reminds me of brandy. Caramel and candied sugar flavors populate the front. Ale glides over the tongue and some alcohol is noticed in the middle, though not in a bad way. The 9% abv is handled very well. Some spiciness and malt, right before the green apple finish. Warming sensation from the alcohol permeates the chest. I'm glad I was able to find it around here. Definitely worth it.","Winter","Nov 17, 2003"

4.94,17.1,4,5,5,5,5,"Swampy amber teeming with schools of yeast chunks under an elephantine egg cream bonnet. The aromas! Caramel coated fruit, honeysuckle, ripe cantaloupe and August wet pavement, history and future and life seething. Sweet on the attack turns beech and maple old growth forest and the leaves and brown ferns and fungi filling the air with scents of existense and then a little sour finish and a need for more. Meaty this beer, yet light and fanciful. It's all in there and I haven't turned into a blueberry yet.","inebrius","Nov 05, 2003"
4.47,5.9,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Awesome deep amber in color, head starts fairly ambitious then fades after a minute or two. Firm and generous lace with good stick throughout. My only complaint is that this thing looks like a back woods pond in terms of floaters. I'm talkin mega chunks here-big ones that go plop when they enter the glass. Aromas are similar to the grand cru, with first impressions again of very fine dark choclate, then a fruitiness redolent of kirsch, and the inside of a really good chocolate covered cherry. Candy sugar and soft malt also comes through. The mouthfeel is rather buttery and warming-the alcohol is very nicely hidden. Rather wine like and very easy to drink. In fact, I'm heading into the bedroom with a second glass to see how it pairs with my newest read. Buy it if you find it! You might want to strain this sucker through a coffee filter if any guests are the faint of heart type.","moulefrite","Oct 26, 2003"
4.67,10.7,4.5,5,4.5,5,4.5,"Sampled at the Kulminator in Antwerp, BE. This was a 1999 (?) vintage. The aromas are that of spices, alcohol, red wine (port?), yeast, candy sugar, and more.

4.55,7.8,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,5,"One of my very favorite beer styles! It poured a medium sized tan head that contained fine-small sized bubbles that was mostly diminishing. The body was carbonated, there was floating particles observed and the body was hazy with a copper hue. The nose was malty, caramel, sweet, and had various fruit notes to it. The flavor was a bit bitter, acidic, caramel, some alcohol notes, and a bit tart/tangy. The palate was smooth and light-medium bodied. This beer had excellent lacing to it. The appearance would have received a 5 rating if it had not been for the floating particles.","hotstuff","Oct 09, 2003"

4.25,0.7,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,3.5,"Overall Impression: Having been "talked-up" by many people, the reputation of this beer was built up quite a bit, so I was setting myself up for potential disappointment. However, as you can see, that wasn't the case. There is as much delicacy in this beer as there is brute force. Plays out like a barleywine, done Belgian-style. I can see why it's a big hit with malt-fiends and strong ale fans. This 750 ml bottle is a bit much to take on alone... I'm going to have to sequester myself!","GreenCard","Sep 30, 2003"
4.3,1.9,4,4,4.5,5,4,"Medium brown color, cloudy with lots if suspended yeasties. Medium beige foamy head. Aroma is fruity (bananas, cherries and plums), malty (bready and grainy) with all the typical Belgian sweetness, spiciness and complexity that you would expect. A full bodied Belgian Ale. Malts are bready, fruity and sweet. Touch of spiciness. WOW There is a lot of competing flavors going on in this beer. Its mostly sweet malts, but there are hints and flavors of raisins, apricots, oranges, chocolate and toffee. Very smooth and mellow tasting. Excellent beer. It hides the 9% alcohol very well. Finish is incredibly smooth. Note the bottle I tasted had lots of stuff floating around in it, but it did not detract from the taste at all. Mouthfeel is very full and round. Finish is smooth and a touch dry. Aftertaste is sweet. with hints of chocolate.","beerguy101","Sep 28, 2003"
4.7,11.4,5,5,4.5,5,4.5,"Finally, I got to see what all the hype was about. The color is burgandy-minus -- that is, a few shades lighter, yeilding a muddled brown-red color. In the second glass, huge chunks of yeast float freely and bob around in the brew. The head starts large and puffy and retreats to a thin film atop the beer. However, the lacing is always coating the sides of the glass with every sip. A really sharp looking beer for sure. Plum skin, alcohol, sugar, banana bread, and fruit grace this beer's tremendously potent nose. I can't even begin to describe such sweet redolence -- a bouquet of purely epic proportions. The Star Wars of the beer aroma world. And it follows through. Melon, fruit, and strong sugary sweets make up a flavor profile that finishes with a slight alcohol bitterness that becomes more and more noticeable as the beer warms beyond ideal consumption temperatures. Upon first sips, however, you could never predict a 9%abv if you were unfamilar with Belgian beers. Truly a well-blended balance of unique flavors. And supremely drinkable for such a strong, flavorful brew. World-class all the way.","marburg","Sep 17, 2003"
3.71,-12.1,4.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Appearance: A vibrant glowing ruby brown tone with a tan thicket of frothy foaming head, leaving thickets of scattered bars of lacing just amazng appearance. Aroma: Doughy yeast spreads into a vegetable tone with a warming musky combonation of alcohol and yeast notes simply nothing like it out there in my opinion. A floral pine musty hop with a decadence of following flavor what a complex belgian style ale. Taste: Musty stir fried vegetables especially peas and carrots but somehow it works as a flavor with a woody finish and genuine sweet vegetables, it's a big question mark of what the fuck happened to this beer. Mouthfeel: Fuller bodied orgininal true to a mindblowing experience of flavor brew, very interesting could take some getting used to. Drinkability: Althought musky this beer does every questioning to one's senses I can imagine, wow I guess all I can say is try it and hope I am ready for this caliber of complexity.","WVbeergeek","Sep 15, 2003"

The aroma is malty, with a sort of melony fruitiness to it and a noticeable yeast character. Quite sniffable, but the flavor is the real treat. It simply melts in your mouth. A rather toasty malt starts things off with a toffee-like character. A surprisingly tropical fruitiness kicks in mid-palate, followed by a moderate but pleasing hop bitterness.

Waft of sweet, ripe grape and lychee like fruitiness upfront in aroma, followed by mellow must and notes of green apple. Tart hints of acidic lime like citrus along with dark caramel round the aroma out. A pleasure to inhale. Tinge of perfume laced bittersweetness is perceived initially, then is ceded by a dark, Boston brown bread like molasses and whole wheat bread combination. Grape and golden raisin like fruitiness run parallel with a floral, rose like impression. Late surge of dark caramel. Hint of peppery alcohol and trace clove adds a pleasantly spicy and herbal undertone. Moderate in body, with a lightly dextrinous and agreeably slick mouthfeel. Hop bitterness is noticed indirectly by its superb offsetting of residual malt sweetness. Long finish of honey drizzled rustic bread, preceded by a snap of yeast must. Luxurious. Uniquely clean and light on fermentation byproducts, yet tremendously deep in flavor profile. Supremely drinkable and thus beautifully dangerous.
