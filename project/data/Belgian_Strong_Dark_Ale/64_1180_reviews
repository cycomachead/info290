"O: A big Belgian dark strong ale."

"O - Good Beer, probably wouldn't search around to find it agian."

"Another one of their great creations"
"On tap at DFH alehouse Fairfax poured into pint. Medium brown, minimal head with little lacing. Aroma is raisins/dried fruit, caramel, alcohol - all faint. Flavor is similar, with an almost figgy taste, overall, and a red wine note. Good mouthfeel, medium bodied with medium carbonation."

""
""
"Thought my inaugural post would cover one of the most underrated beers on the planet. I disagree with most posters who state this is an overly sweet beer and do believe the use of raisin is both subtle and interesting at the same time.  I would not call it a brown ale and would classify it In a general fruit/veg category."
"Very nice! Smooth, sweet, and great aftertaste."

"I had high expectations, it was a big letdown. Put this on the ""no buy list"""

"Ok ..this beer is complex it has a great smooth taste and for the amount of alcohol  in this baby it goes down like butter. Can't rave enough about it You can get this sweet nectar on tap directly at Dogfish Brew Tavern in Gaithersburg Md ..here's the key's ...more Raison Please.."

"I have had this beer many times and like it a lot so I decided to do a full review. Good looking beer that is wonderful to the nose. Very tasty, rich and full, plus bonus points for ABV versus drinkability. Dogfish hit yet again with this one, I have bought this multiple times and is definitely worth trying."

"I had this at a Dogfish Head restaurant the other night and I can say that it is certainly one of the standouts of theirs for me. I didn't have a chance to try Midas Touch or anything too wild, but I quite enjoyed this one along with a precisely medium lamb burger. All in all a good experience from start to finish. A spicy Belgian malt and yeast taste serves to excellently compliment a color and faint sweetness which are not entirely unlike Russian kvass (a beer-like soft drink made from fermenting roasted bread rusks together with a variety of fruits and herbs). Definitely something I would order again or buy in stores."
""
"Actually a very solid beer. Very tasty and balanced. Unique and different. Would buy again."
""
"This bottle was aged for two years and perhaps added to the character and variety of taste. Overall I found it to be quite exceptional."

"O: Enjoyable beer to drink, but very rich in flavor. This is a nice beer to drink from time to time. Recommended."
"O = This is a good hearty winter brew. I would not accompany this with a grilled steak as is suggested by the brewer, but rather a rich flavored, savory stew with a large chunk of crusty homemade dark bread and butter. You need rich fats to accompany this properly. So, also enjoy this with rich, flavorful artisanal cheeses and crusty breads. If pairing with food, make sure this ale won't overpower!"

"Well, I like Raison D'Être and used to pick it up frequently when it was available, but now I wish I had a few more of these in the cellar. I'm going to try to get my sister to haul back a few more. Rating is an average of the two ales; I liked the aged one quite a bit more than the new one, which was still enjoyable."
""
"Lives up to the description and pours a deep mahogany. Almost no head with a lot of disproportionation. The nose has notes of raisin and malt but doesn't have much to it besides that. It is decent and delivers what the beer is meant to smell like, but no further phenols. Tastes of malt and raisin but the alcohol destroys the balance, overwhelming the beer. The mouthfeel is good, medium bodied with nice carbonation. Overall just an ok beer."

"It is a not pretentious beer. As simple as it is offers amazing and complexes experiences. Poured solidly without excess of carbonating. Dense creamy brownish foam and delicate sweet woody smell. Tasting wise, it give the consistency enough to enjoy every single buds in your mouth some malt and chocolate smooth after taste. Every day beer for everybody. Have annotate that some of my friends (regular ale lovers) find this exemplar very attractive. Making it a nice smooth transition to more mature beers."

"Retains subtle sweetness with deep dark fruits and dried fruit/trail mix notes. Beet sugars keep that vegetal note intact, but the boast of fig and raisin flavors have evolved into a complex fruit element that includes plum, date, and dried apricot. More of that intense clove-y phenolic character with a cough medicine vibe. Carbonation is soft-medium and fills out a hefty body mouthfeel. Booze is totally a non-factor. This beer really aged well. I rather enjoy it."

"Overall: A very well balanced strong dark ale that really showcases malt complexity. There are a few elements that detract from the overall impression, such as the watery texture and the hint of cough syrup in the flavor. Still, a very well done version of the style that doesn't need to try too hard to impress. Would recommend this to someone just starting to get into big beers."

"I hate the fru-fru name, but I like the beer. The brew is sweet and heavy with raisins, dried plum and cherry, becoming a little “boozy” with some additional malty breadiness as it warms. It’s not something I’d have every day, but I’d enjoy it as a dessert drink on a cold winter's evening (when I had a designated driver)."

"I don't know how many times I passed on this one. Finally, it was offered at my weekly beer tasting. I liked it and decided to take some home. Very glad I did. I assumed it was categorized as a fruit/vegetable beer. When I tried it, I thought it's flavor profile reminded me a lot of a dubbel, only lacking some of the rich maltiness. When I saw this was a Belgian Strong Dark Ale, I definitely agreed. It's a very nice beer and I'm glad we have a brewer like DFH who is willing to constantly try new things."
""
""
""
""
"This is a really great beer to drink by itself. If I just want to sit down and have a beer this is a goto of mine. The beer is tasty and has a complex flavor to it. It can be enjoyed like you would enjoy a good wine. It pairs will with steak. I haven't had it on tap yet, but look forward to when I will."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I didn't know what to expect from this beer. This style is not one I would have expected from DFH, but I was intrigued. It seems to miss the mark a little. It is not a beer a beer I will revisit, but I am glad I gave it a try. DFH has almost always been a go to brewery for me, but I will pass on this in the future."

"The Raison D'Etre poured a deep mahogany with a fruity, malty aroma. It tasted like a sweet Belgian Dubbel with a rich and deep flavor that hints at raisins, sweet dark fruits, and a bit of caramel malt. I enjoy a good Belgian Dubbel and the Raison D’Etra hit all the right notes for me. It is a unique and complex brew that I have no trouble enjoying."

"I wish I could get excited, but once again, it's style above substance in Milton--this is certainly not the reason why beer exists."
"Complex with a very unique flavor, it felt to me like a mix of an English Bitter, a Brown Ale and a Belgian Dark Ale. Interesting beer, especially if you are in the mood for trying something different."

""
""
""
""
""

"The aroma is the only thing that I found slightly attractive. The immediate taste is strong raisin taste, almost like eating a handful of raisins that have been sitting out in the sun all day. 240 calories per bottle with 8% ABV. Not an IPA fan at all and this has a similar strong bitter flavor."

"Overall this is a pretty nice beer, but I feel like they could have toned down the abject sweetness just a tad and it would have worked a little better; that raisin flavor is just too much to handle when it smacks you in mouth, but this beer is also a grower. I was very off-put on my first bottle, but after subsequent drinks I've come to like this a little more. I would drink it if offered, but probably won't be buying again. That said, I appreciate what the guys at Dogfish Head were trying to do; I just feel like they could have executed a little bit better."
"The label states that the beer has a ""sense of purpose", and I don't know what the purpose is, but whatever it is, this beer might have a bit too much of it."

" ~ I have four of these cellared and will re-review when the time is right. I truely feel this is one of those special beers that will increase in complexity and character as it ages. I guess I'll find out. (3.5)"

"My rose garden (over 265 fragrant varieties) was in need of some TLC, several hours worth so I crank up the CD player drop in some relaxing jazz and venture later onto some Van Halen. During the course of five hours and some intensive work later, I drank the entire six-pack and I was very satisfied. Most likely I will purchase it again and not work as hard as I did in the garden. Later on that week I would enjoy some Bells Two-Hearted Ale as well."

"what a wonderful tasting beer it dances on your tongue makes you feel alive but itsa strong beer so be careful fig raisins dark fruit and other wonder things not too dark thats what i think but a beer that you can get lost for a while in enjoy it dont let it destory you happy drinking"

"It’s a very delicious beer and the adjuncts do not ruin this beer. So refreshing, reminds me a ton of Unibroue’s beers. This beer tastes like it could use some age and mellowing. It was bottled on 12/12/12."
"Overall: A good dessert type beer, and perhaps it would be excellent paired with certain foods. However, this one is just a bit too sweet for me. Would drink again, but would not seek it out."
""
""
""
""
"the label describes this beer as ""mahogany"" which pretty much nails the color. the smell is ok, nothing stands out that much in the nose, just slight dark sweetness. the taste is full and sweet full of dark fruitiness. the finish is warm, this beer feels like christmas time to me. over all i like it a good bit. i still hate that i have to go out of town to get my hands on dogfishhead....someone in my area needs to get their shat together."

"Overall: I had no idea what to expect going into this and came away pleasantly surprised. I really enjoyed this and while it is different and may not appeal to the masses it is def worth checking out. Classified as a Belgian Strong Dark Ale @ 8% ABV. Consumed 5/23/2013."

"This is the Belgian (dark) strong ale that got me hooked into the category. The beer has a terrific complexity ranging from a caramel toffee to spiced banana and each sip finishes with a welcoming alcoholic punch and smooth mouthfeel. Hard to describe but certainly worth seeking out at under $10 for a 6-pack. Well done DFH."

"O: An excellent beer. I haven't had a bad Belgian Strong Dark yet, and this one is arguably my favorite."
"overall: A great offering from Dogfish Head, while it's hard to classify most of their beers, I would say this is their take on a trappist ale with a slight raisin touch. Very well balanced and I would buy this again in a heartbeat, if you like trappist beers, belgian strong ales, or trippels (and quads) you can find some common ground here. Great beer."
"Drinkability: It's a very smooth drinkable beer accompanied with good flavors and aromas."
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall, a beer that definitely stands out yet somehow remains pretty average for me. I probably wouldn't buy this again."

"Raison D'Etre (No idea how to pronounce it...) is a beer that I'd have to recommend. I hadn't had a Belgian Strong Dark Ale before this one, so I don't know how they normally are, but this is a pleasant beer. Looks great, smells good, feels good. Like I said a couple times though, the aftertaste is a bit much. Still, pick this one up -- but maybe only a single if you can, since this really isn't a beer you won't be wanting to drink more than one of, more than likely."
""
""
""
"O/D - A nice BSDA. Complex and tasty, but with a weak body. Otherwise a good example of the style, and a good intro to Belgian-styles from North America. A touch too sweet."
""
""
""
"Consumed on 4/26/13"
""
""
""
""
"Final Thoughts: Not a style I'm crazy about but a good beer none the less. If you enjoy Belgian Ales or unconventional ingredients in beer then this one is for you. Would I drink it again? Yes, if fresh."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Raison D’Être is one of my favorite beers from Dogfish Head.  Actually, it’s one of my favorite beers period.  It’s a great beer and an excellent American example of one of my favorite beer styles, the Belgian Strong Dark Ale.  Highly recommended!"
""
""
"Bought a six pack at Table and Vine. Poured with a high head that quickly dissipated. Has a slightly amber, brown color. Aromas were a mix of sugars, a syrup-like flavor, malts, and raisins. The taste and flavoring was sweet with a slight fruit flavor and caramel. Surprisingly sweet. The drink has a medium carbonation, giving it a crispness but also not making it too strong. Overall, not too bad."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - one of the first craft brews i tried back in the day, i bought it again to review recently and it was better than i remember (probably due to a more developed palette and experience with other belgian strongs). IMHO it's rated a little low overall. it holds its own with Belgian born strongs. Love the raisin presence"
""
"O - I probably wouldn't buy it again. I enjoyed the second bottle I drank, but by the end of the six-pack I was really just clearing fridge space. In fact I gave the last bottle to my roommate and opted for an alternative I had on hand. It wasn't the worst thing I've tried this year but it certainly didn't inspire me to add it to my shopping list."

"Overall: decent beer, doesn't blow you away, but is tasty."

"O- A unique beer from a unique brewery. I really do enjoy dogfishhead a lot and i can say the same about this beer. Maybe a tad more dark malt would add some bitterness that is missing. Maybe tone down on the raisins as it's a little too sweet for the style."
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured a 12oz bottle into a Samuel Adams Glass. Poured a medium-deep brown with a light tan colored head. Most of the head disappears pretty quickly, but a little lingers on and leaves a little lacing on the glass. Aroma is mostly sweet malt notes (caramel, fruit) and a little bit of spice. The taste is very similar, with just s hint of hop bitterness on the finish. A little heavy on the carbonation and little thin on the mouthfeel but neither is really a detriment."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- First beer from Dogfish. I must say I'm very impressed. It's very complex, yet very drinkable. The alcohol is hidden very well. Everything from the look to the taste has me happy. The only thing keeping me from giving it a 5 is what I read about this style and the fact that I've never had one in this category before."
""
""
" Many beers draw you in with exciting ingredients, of which often turn out to be more or less marketing. I am happy to say with Dogfish Head's Raison D'Etre, this is not the case. Dogfish has a reputation for brewing some very interesting beers and raison d is no exception. 'Raison D'Etre' is a French phrase meaning 'reason for existence'. While this may not be MY reason for existence, I did enjoy and would recommend giving it a taste!"
""

"O-Good beer that has a fantastic smell, but seems to struggle in other areas. I've heard it's a beer that divides it's drinkers. This is definitely not my beer."

"This beer really took me by surprise. A velvety texture, with a unique finish - the Raison does not disappoint. It has a slightly tangy and subtle white grape linger with a slight sweetness to it. Definitely a conversational piece and well worth trying."

"Beer has an overpowering aroma of sugary raisins, sugars and malts. Has a very earthy body, light coloring, and a nice lace. Beer is a bit pungent and has a strange tinge to it. I expect much better from Dogfish Head, but this is not exactly he worst beer on the planet. Try it because it is a Dogfish, but stick to one bottle versus a 6 pack."
""
""
""
"Taste raisin up front backed by caramelized sugar notes. Body is a bit thin and it is woody and dry like a wine. Not a bad beer, but not great either - it is a little confusing to the palate."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Drank out of the glass bottle. The smell was pleasant, with a soft aroma that carried a thick sweetness, with definite traces of raisin carried throughout. In terms of taste, the beer is very sweet, almost overpoweringly so. The raisin and sugar are apparent, masking the alcohol until the aftertaste. Overall, the sweet mixture gives this beer a unique and strong character that can at times be overwhelming. Consuming a single bottle of this beer, in my opinion, is enjoyable for its unique and sweet flare; anything more would be a bit too much sweetness."

""
""

"O: Definitely not a bad beer. Just a bit lacking in terms of complexity and flavor."
""
"The beer is auburn hued. Autumnal colors of ruby, crimson, russet. Small off white head that fades pretty quickly to a thin, wispy layer atop the beer. The aroma offers sweet malt, toffee, raisins, brown sugar, clove, a touch of holiday spice. Really sweet throughout. Bitter kick in the finish. Sweet raisins soaked in the booze. Fun to try, but best in small quantities. Too sweet. I don't consider this in the Belgian style at all. Where is the yeast and bread character that is so appreciated and associated with a Belgian strong dark ale? I appreciate the fact that Sam brews interesting beers, but I won't return to this one."

"Overall: just outstanding. Unusual and fantastic. One of the first 'big' beers I had some 6 years ago when I was turned onto craft. Seems small compared to the monsters I've had since, but this, unlike many beers that early on seemed top tier and later disappointed, is great with every revisit."

"O: A very nice beer. Because the flavor is subtle, this is one beer you can have several of in a night and not be overwhelmed. I think this beer gets better as the night goes on (no, that isn't the case with all of them, haha.)"
"Overall, this is a very solid beer. Not one that is overwhelmingly good, but one for a good change of pace. I think this would be a good starter beer for people looking to get into the other Belgian styles (dubbel, trippel)."

""
""

"O: The fruit component is a bit lighter than you'd expect both from being brewed with raisin and for a Dark Strong although the brew calls it a Belgian Brown. When I think if this as a Dark Strong it seems disappointing thin on the flavors and note fruity enough but when I think of a Brown brewed with Belgian yeast this all makes sense as is fairly enjoyable which is how I scored it."

"This tasting was a two year bottle from the celler. served cold 40f the head was a 1 inch in frosted mug.. left fast mice lacing in the glass. nice red brown color. taste smooth and creamy no sharp notes a nice smooth finish. this beer tames out so good with age. the draw back this goes down easy and fast be careful this is in a class by it self one of the best."

"O: I recognize why some people don't like it, but I've always liked this beer."

"O – This is a pretty good beer. Unfortunately, it runs the disadvantage of belonging to a style with some of the best beers out there. As I said above, it’s tasty but just not as complex as it needs to be to graduate to the plus-4 tier. Still, I’m glad I tried it."

"I wouldnt seek this one out again. I thought this paired horribly with aged cheddar, although i blame the cheddar to try and keep my opinion beer-focused. I would, however, like to try their D' Extra version of this."

""
""
"Of the two, the thing that would drive an impulse buy would be sight-- I'd immediately order it again if I saw this served with a 2 finger head of tight Champagne yeast bubbles next time I'm looking across the bar somewhere that serves it."
""
""
"O- Just about average. Will most likely try this beer again. Feel like I was missin something. Want this beer to be better than what it turned out to be."
""
""
""
"O - decent, was recommended but wouldn't re-recommend. It's a bit smoky, very dark, which is just not my preference in ales."

"A good brew overall. I like it so far, as this is my first belgian strong dark ale. Two others from Unibroue are waiting in the fridge."
""
"Salud!"
""
""
""

"Overall it's a beer in chaos, but it's not bad. I really don't think this fits the Belgian strong dark ale category nearly as well as it would fit the brown ale category, except for perhaps the yeast. But even then, the usual Belgian notes just aren't there to the extent that you'd expect."

"Overall this beer didn't not impress me, I was really hoping the raisins or malt would be highlighted but overall I didn't enjoy the taste from beginning to end and was just left a bit confused at the inspiration for this brew. The alcohol is out of balance and nothing in the flavor profile of the beer left me wanting to try more."
""
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a snifter. Pours a nice deep maroon color with a small white head that dissipates quickly but leaves a little lacing. Smells of fruit dominated by raisins. Tastes of raisins and slight grape taste with some wine-like hints. Beer is carbonated correctly, goes down smooth with only a slight taste of fruit aftertaste. Overall, a very good beer."

""
""
"Overall, Dogfish Head is one of my favorite American breweries.... I love everything they put out.... To be ""American Beer of the Year", though.... C'mon.... I enjoy much of their other brews as much as, or more than, this particular one.... Perhaps, it's because I LOVE Belgian beers so much, and they represent this as a Belgian style.... It is still a delicious brew, because it has the taste of a ""wine-beer"".... I do like this beer."

"Raison D'Etre pours a fairly translucent ruby red, with a good amount of lighter red highlights. Maybe a finger and half of cream colored foam rises up atop the beer. Head retention is alright, and lacing is fairly disappointing/nonexistent. The nose is simply wonderful. Raisin centric dark fruits lead the charge, braced by a firm supporting aroma of brown sugar. A light clove note completes the picture. The flavor profile doesn't quite follow that layout, to somewhat ill effect. Everything starts out fine, with the raisins, plums, and figs taking the spotlight, but leaving some room for the brown sugar. The finish though is pretty harsh. I don't know if the phenols are just too intense, or there's some unnecessary hop bitterness exacerbating them, but the beer just doesn't close nearly as smoothly as it should. The mouthfeel is decent, with a nice, vibrant carbonation. The body is just a little bit full, but it's a close thing. Raison D'Etre is another solid offering from Dogfish Head."

"Not as good as I expected. The beer has a weak head that disappeared too quickly. The smell and flair. was hinting at a barrel aged quality. Overall-it was kind of average and I would not be too exited about it in the future. The beer is not that drinkable."

""
""

"It pours a muddy amber with barely any head. In the nose it's fruity, bananas are what I immediately thought of, and there's the smell of chewy malts. The taste is dominated by the strange taste of beets. Off the bat I'm not really a fan. The deep malt taste isn't offensive but it can't do much to save this beer from my judgement. It has a nice carbonation and a light body. Overall I can't say I'm really enjoying this beer at all. That's Dogfish Head for you, it can be really hit or miss!"
""
""
""
"Overall: Not my favorite of the style but an interesting and delicious entrance by Dogfish Head. Definitely worth trying and enjoying."
""
""
""
""
"This raison beer doesn't disappoint - lives up to its name. Belgian strength and flavor. Pours a deep amber with a decent head at pour that disappates. Nose is strong raisons and some alcohol despite its 8% ABV. Sweeter malts linger on the back end and some sour raison flavor on the front. This beer is about a year old and has aged decently despite its middle ABV (have also had it fresh and consistent with my memory)."

"A nice different flavorful ale from DFH. They often go too far with their flavor profiles but this one works for me."
"M: it is thin but not hot or alcohol at all comes off as about 5.5% in the mouth. Very drinkable even chug-able but I wouldn't recommend. The beer does have lacing but very little thin head more like juice but not in a bad way still without a doubt 4.5/5 beer."

"Taste is full of complexity. Dark fruits and banana with a cocoa and coffee flair. Think mocha with a light shot of banana syrup. Dry chalky finish with a pleasing pucker that while not hoppy gives a similar clean crispness. Light syrupy feel and mild carbonation. A very nice take on the style and quite drinkable. Indeed the drinkability is one of the best qualities of this beer. It is the closest thing to a session BSDA I have had. Not a standout but a definite regular on my shopping list from now on."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a clear dark brown with a 1/2 inch foamy dark khaki head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small patches of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of toasted malt, brown sugar, and some slight dried fruit aromas. Taste is of roasted and toasted malt, burnt sugar, spice, and some fruity flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of roasty and spice bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer flavor wise but I think I like the aromas I am getting over the flavors."

"I'm still new to the beer tasting seen so bare with me. I'm typically a whisky connoisseur when I have a real meaty meal but the other night I decided I was going to branch out. I was at as small plate restaurant called ""girl and the goat"" which I highly recommend in Chicago. Any ways I told the waitress I wanted a full body beer that had somewhat of a bitter/sweet finish, she recommended the Raison D'Etre. Needless to say this beer did not disappoint. The brew was full of flavor and match quite well with my steak and fish. This has become my new favorite beer when I only want one or two drinks with a nice steak. I hope this review was helpful."

"Pours a brown color with a thick three finger head. Smells of Belgian yeast and chocolate. Tastes pretty good. There are chocolate, pepper, clove, and coffee notes. It does finish a tad hot, that is the biggest fault I can find with this beer. It has a good amount of carbonation, not enough to over power the flavor of the beer, which is substantial. Overall, this is a pretty good beer. I have had it before, years ago on draft, picked based upon the interesting name. I feel good about my decision then, and even better about it now. Quite a different beer than what I have recently been drinking."

"This is a nice nutty brown ale. Smell a little vanilla/banana. The raisin flavor is subtle, but expected that. It has a nice balance of hops, not too bitter, dark copper color. Some malt/molasses overpowers as it warms, but tastes really good at first pour!"
""
"O- It's nice, and I'll certainly try it again... but I was expecting more from this Belgian Strong Dark Ale. Nothing to write home about, but certainly not bad at all. Nice nose, flavor and look... but the thin mouth was a let down on this. Too bad."
""
"Poured from bottle into NB globe. Pours a mnaple syrup looking brown with ruby red hue. No head and ever so small lacing. Smells of amber malts, sweet dried fruit, and a hint of vanilla. Taste is of very malty dried raison. Some boozey vanilla notes. Seemingly hidden flavors at fist taste, but they really develop on the tongue in the aftertaste. Its fantastically smooth and really full of hidden flavors that linger. Overall, this is a great brew. Not sure if id classify as a belgian though. Its taste a little closer to a a Strong Ale, but either way, its a great brew and worthy of a try. Im gonna age one in my closet for a few months and report back..."

This is a great beer to analyze with friends and it's got me wondering if I can make one half as nice myself. However, two of these may be my limit for an evening - between the high alcohol, complex flavors, and full body it is very filling."

"O: I really like this beer. While the flavor doesn't quite make it to a 4.5, there is something about it that's really satisfying. Will definitely buy again."

"Definitely a unique brew here using belgian beet sugars and green raisins. Some may find it extraordinary, I found it to get on my nerves after about half the bottle. It hides its alcohol well enough and has a decent mouthfeel, but the caramelized brown sugar and green raisin notes didn't work together. I suspect this will be a highly polarizing brew, but I'll pass and opt for Trois Pistoles in the future."

""
""
""
""

"Mouthfeel is good- moderate carbonation around the edges and a good medium body. This is an odd one- DFH certainly has a fascination with grapes, which I feel do not belong in beer. If you want the full flavor experience, drink out of a tulip, chalice, etc., but if you just want a reasonably priced, high ABV brew just drink it from the bottle or in a pint."

A little muddled and doesn't finish particularly clean. Not bad, but won't seek it out. I just don't get it."

"O: An overall excellent beer, nice toned-down fruit flavors with just the right amount of alcohol and sweetness throughout"
"Pleasantly balanced brew with some tingly clove spice under the soft brown sugary maliness. For the ABV it is not heavy and drinks a bit too easily. Solid brew."
"Poured a mahogany color (this is good), but minimal head, some bubbles but no retention. Sweet aroma of molasses and sugar, are dominant. Some fruit (green raisin?) and herbal hops. Nice mixture of smells. Complex pile of flavors. Some of the same sweetnes from the sugars, molasses and caramel flavors. Some spiciness, almost yeasty notes as well. Herbal, earthy hop finish. Lots of alcohol coming through as well. Medium body and carbonation, not really as smooth and creamy as I was expecting, a bit of a hot finish from the alcohol. Overall this is a complex, and flavor filled beer, but just didn't do anything for me. I guess I had a different idea for a Belgian Dark Ale. It is good, but just not for me. I still have a couple bottles - maybe the flavors will grow on me."
"Pours as described: mahogany, with a finger of honey cream foam that falls to a scattered surface leaving cobweb lace. Smells of raisins, honey, candy, and the slightest hint of brown sugar. Flavor is sweet and malty. Plenty of the candy sugar comes through, and the malts seem appropriately oxidized adding just a hint of woody character. There is a nice, subtle belgian character in the yeast, but not nearly as dominant as the homeland offerings. Nice, moderate body is matched with a good, smooth and prickly carbonation. I dig this offering, not so much fresh, but at this point, I really enjoyed."

"12 ounce bottle into tulip, bottled 12/13/2011. Pours slightly cloudy red orange color with a nice 2 finger fairly dense khaki head with great retention that reduces to nice cap that lingers. Some spotty thick lacing on the glass. Aromas of big molasses, raisin, candi sugar, plum, caramel, herbal spiciness, chocolate, toasted malt, biscuit, yeast spices, and a touch of alcohol. Nice and well balanced aromas with some good complexity. Taste of big molasses, caramel, herbal spice, chocolate, raisin, candi sugar, biscuit, toasted malt, and yeast spices. Lingering notes of caramel, biscuit, dark fruit, molasses, toasted malt, and spiciness on the finish for a bit. Nice balance of flavors with good malt balance without being cloying. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a fairly creamy and slick mouthfeel. Alcohol is well hidden with only a warming on the finish present. Smooth drinking for the alcohol level, but is still a sipper. Overall this is a very nice Belgian dark ale; with nice complexity and good flavor balance. Really enjoyed this one."

My overall impression is that this is a well made beer that is worth visiting and re-visiting once in a while. It doesn’t beat out the better made Belgian beers but holds its own amongst the many average beers made in Belgium."

"O – Kind of a strange blend. None of the individual flavors are bad, and I would hesitate to call it “unbalanced”, but in my opinion the flavors presented didn’t come together very well. A little bit of a mess, and the metallic aftertaste became a little distracting over time. I can see where they were going with this, but ultimately I think it misses the mark a little. Probably wouldn’t buy again."

""
"Overall – Not really my type of beer. It had a bit too much of a wine like flavor, almost as though a white wine was mixed with a brown ale. If I want wine I will drink wine and if I want a brown ale I will drink one; the two together don’t meld too well in my opinion."
""

"O- This is definitely an off centered ale for off centered people. Very extreme on the sweetness and alcohol content but not in a bad way. Wish the coffee aftertaste wasn't there. It's not for me but it's a pretty good beer."

"(Notes from two days ago)"
"O - Many times more enjoyable after letting it warm to mid 50's. Raw sugars are obvious, pretty sweet but the dark fruityness helps balance it well. Alcohol undetectable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: this is very good for its style and good to me"
""
""

""
""
"3.0 D: I'm happy to have revisited this beer after so many years. It brings back good memories of college. Decent beer and great for noobz."
""
""
"O - Not something I thought I'd dig, but this is awesome. Currently cooking a curry dish and I wish I had saved to pair with the meal. Definitely different, and highly recommended."
"I enjoy this beer as an inexpensive go to when I want plenty of dark fruit. Could use a bit more complexity."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Complex for sure. Just enough bite to make this one a sipper, but a savory one at that. Like a combination of a brown ale, coffee stout, and Belgian dubbel."
""
""
"It's a sweet spiced hopy taste. The flavors are nice but not very well balanced. Maybe it was the hype but I was a tad disappointed. Still a decent beer, but not all I expected I guess. Feels like a spicier brown ale to me, nothing special in my book."
""
""
""
"O: Fairly tasty, but not a stand out. I guess I was expecting a little more from a Dogfish label."
""
"I'm not crazy about dark and roasty brews but this one is nice, sweet but not super sweet. I cannot for the life of me find the raisins in this. Definitely shows its Belgian style roots."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, as expected from DFH, very well done."
""
""
""
"Pours a deep, deep mahogany with a foamy 1/2 inch off-white head. Good amount of lacing on the glass throughout. Smell is sweet and malty, with a hint of prunes, dates, and cocoa. Taste is also sweet, but considering the 8% ABV, this is very easy to drink. Really a stellar beer. Perfect for a cold winter day."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Even still I absolutely love this beer. (4,4,5,4.5,4.5)"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Final notes: So sweet, boozy, and delicious. Great nightcap."
"The beer starts off very promising. The color and aroma is certainly appealing and implies that the beer will deliver more than just that. However, the beer takes a real dive in quality when it comes to the taste. The mouthfeel is nice, but it doesn't really make up for everything else. It's very easy to drink and enjoyable as you start to drink it, but upon deeper analysis, it does not shine the way that i expect of DFH brews."
"O - This beer takes some getting used to, but it's quite complex and worth it. The 8% alcohol can sneak up on you if you have more than one of these in a sitting."
""
""
""
""
"Taste follows and has more pronounced fig and alcohol. Surprisingly hot for the style. Brown sugar, raisins (of course) and some spices. The belgian yeast is there but not overly evident. Taste is generally subdued and the beer is quite drinkable, though not my favorite style. Almost a session-able Belgian strong, other than the high abv of course."
""
"The flavors are good, but this one is a little underwhelming for a Belgian Strong Ale, especially from Dogfish Head, who are an otherwise excellent brewery."
""
""
""
"single finger off white head with good retention on a hazy crimson / amber body. No lacing. Aroma is mostly belgian yeast and esters. Mild overall. Some dark fruit and fig. Not too sweet. Flavor is like a mild belgian with mire sugar, fig and dark fruit. Again this is dogfish head taking a beer style and mellowing it out to appeal to the masses and more typical everyday beer drinker but charging the normal belgian beer price. Not a bad beer but not a good member of its genre."

""
"Overall- It's interesting, but the metallic aftertaste and feeling ruin it a bit for me. I've seen the price on this brew fluctuate quite a bit, which I assume means the brewery has gone through a couple revisions- hopefully they figure it out. I'll pick this one up once in a while in a mixed six depending on my mood, but really prefer Smuttynose Gravitation when raisins are beckoning and it's available."

""
""
"O: Overall I thought the beer was very good. It doesn't taste like a traditional Belgian beer, but it isn't supposed to be one. It tastes good, smells good, feels good...it's overall a good beer. I wouldn't say it's great."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Very sweet and malty, but I'm not complaining. Looks great, smells great, tastes great. Mouthfeel was perfect. Not crazy about the slight off-putting cleaner-ish type notes in the finihsh, much like the DFH Punk. Overall, however, it's a winner."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall I was a little overwhelmed with the sweetness, DFH captured the raisins as billed. A beer to be enjoyed after dinner in place of dessert."
""
""
""
""
"Well bodied brew neither thick nor thin, with a clean finish. Very crisp and refresing. A nice represenation of a style that I usually find too sweet and slick on the pallet."
"(12 oz bottle into tulip) I've been looking forward to this one for a long time! Poured a deep mahogany (as advertised) with a small frothy off white head that fell quickly. Nose is strong of raisin and pit fruit in general and was very appealing. The drink is very smooth and the beer has a medium body on the tongue. Hints of the alcohol dominate at first, but the aftertaste is of the fruit and malt which is a refreshing sweet finish. One of the better offerings from Dogfish Head to be sure!"
""
""
"Overall--A lot to consider. A truly robust, flavorful beer. It's impossibly heavy and probably overly sugary for most palates. Definitely worth a try, though. Perhaps not a masterful rendition of the Belgian Strong Dark Ale, but it gives your togue plenty to think about."
""
""
""
""
"It's definitely drinkable, but not my favorite. I'll have it when it's available but not seek it out."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - A decent beer, but probably not worth buying 6 of. If your liquor store lets you mix and match like mine, it may be worth throwing in a pack of some IPAs of very bitter beers to balance out the pack, but other than that I would say a one time buy."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This is a nice beer, but it is quite out of balance in my opinion and seems to suffer from it quite a bit. I liked it, but I don't think I would buy a six pack. My least favorite dogfishead beer I have had to date."
""
""

"Very deep copper brown colour, minimal amount of white head, no lace. Smell is pretty malty, sweet caramel and toffee, fruity, grapes, cherry, raisin, candy like at points, light alcohol. Taste is fairly sweet with a big malt bill, fruity yeastiness, grape, cherry berries with caramel notes at times. Light carbonation, silky-sticky texture, med-full body, nice weight. This grew on me as I drank it and by the end it was pretty good, the first few sips were a little off putting. Not my fav DFH brew so far and will probably pass on picking this up again, still pretty drinkable."

"Medium to big in body, some caramel present somewhere in the middle of the beer. Creamy mouthfeel. A strange and dissapointing brew. Not as cloyingly sweet as others I've had though"

"The palate, on the other hand, is a bit of a mess. Spicy alcohol and phenols combine to make a rather paint-thinner like beer with a mild raisin sweetness in the mid-palate before a moderately strong bitterness takes over in the finish, completely ruining everything. The sugar beets add plenty of sweetness. Now, the paint thinner dissipates as the beer breathes, making it moderately more palatable and brings to mind cheap rum, but the bitterness on the finish really clashes with the raisins and the fruity yeast. Full in body, mildly soapy and slick, this beer is lightly carbonated and rather disappointing. I can't imagine drinking more than 4oz at a time, let alone a 4 pack."
""
"Not sure if I would purchase this for myself, however it was a gift from my brother so you can't pass that up! That high ABV keeps you from drinking too many of these too."

"Notes: This is listed as a BSDA. To me it is too light both in color and in flavor for that, seems a little more like a Doppelbock to me. This is not a bad beer but overall the unmasked alcohol and lack of a strong raisin flavor which is why I bought this beer in the 1st place make it unlikely that I will buy more once this 6 pack is gone."

"mouthfeel is something i am not used to. It is medium bodied, but certainly packs a punch with alcohol. It is a great amount though. It doesn't make you pucker, and it doesn't really linger. I wish it would though because the taste and moutfeel are wonderful."

"Overall: This was a pretty good beer, a little too sweet for my liking not over the top. This would make a great dessert beer. Dogfish Head hasn't disappointed me yet."
"Not as sticky as the bottled stuff. The stiff carbonation eventually falters, & the texture becomes greasy. Alcohol seems in check until it warms up. Just limited my pours to a chilly half a pint at a time & I was able to stay awake long enough to kill the growler."
"Taste is complex because we couldn't even figure out how to discribe it. Here is our best shot: rum raisen pudding with an alcohol trailer. As it warms up it takes on a more nut-like coffee flavor. Overall, not something I would keep in the fridge but would enjoy again."
"Overall Impression- An interesting brew (like anything from DogFish!). Rich and a great Belgian. I was impressed of how the raisins stuck around in the flavor so strongly."
"O: Another interesting brew by Dogfish head - they rarely dissapoint."
"-Overall 3.5: This is a average to good beer with some very unique flavor characteristics that I now see are indicative of several brews from Dogfish Head. Not that it is a bad thing. I think that this beer is slightly better than average, but the things that make it better than average are negatively impacted by the sweetness present in this beer. It is just a little TOO sweet to be a session beer, but it desperately wants to be a session beer. I've written too much about this beer. It's worth a try if you've never had it. Give it a chance."
"O- Not a terrible dark belgian ale. Not very complex though."
"O - This is a delicious and unique beer with only one real downfall, the booze. At 8% it becomes very noticeable. I do love belgian inspired beers, and the sweet raisin flavors and aromas will keep me buying six packs of this brew."
"O - Yeah, didn't care much for this. Not really a winner here. Hard to drink. It's a bit rich, maybe some will ike this, but this one isn't for me."
"O: I'm not a huge fan of this style, but its not bad."
"a very very unique ale. this one pours a mahogany brownish with a patchy tan head an inch thick. nose is quite interesting, fruity, with that belgian yeast complexion, slightly sweet, rich. taste matches the nose, with the flavor of the raisins coming through nicely. as far as i know, there is nothing like this anywhere else on the market. worth seeking out. definitely grows on you over time, only the high ABV and high price tag keep this one from being a daily go to for me. endless food pairing potentials as well..."
"I would choose Raison D'etre above em all. It's crisp, complex, quaffable, high in ABV, refreshing, and trancends seasons. A great beer; but let it grow on you with repeat visits"
"Mouthfeel was pleasant not too much of the sticky sugar feel that will turn me off of any beer"
"O- One of the first craft brews I ever had. Though, after years of research, this isn't one of my favorite Dogfish brews, it's still a good one to have every once in a while."
"D - Very complex and shifting flavors. A great sipper that is better even than the sum of its outstanding parts. Almost like a Belgian abbey ale, but hops and body give a lighter and easier-drinking impression. I have enjoyed this beer from the bottle, but on tap its true genius comes out."
"O: a good brew, complex with a lot of character, scent falls a bit short, mouthfeel isnt the best, good brew either way"
"Overall, this is a good one. I would definitely have another, but not too many. It is a heavy one for my American blood."
"Taste includes alcohol, heavy malt, sweet dark fruit. Mouthfeel is tough...lots of alcohol and much flavor to try and mask it. To me the balance is a bit off. Overall I am glad I tried it but I am not a fan."
"Overall this is a good beer. I wouldnt go seek this out just to have a glass, but if its ever on sale I would gladly pick this up again."
"O - A good beer to be drunk slowly in small quantities by a fire. A good camping beer for a long cool night. This is a beer to tell stories with by the campfire."
"O - Very good dark ale that I would highly recommend."
"O: Enjoyable beer. Alcohol level is high but well disguised. Would suggest to friends and drink again!"
"O - A kinda boring beer. A touch sweet, but not overly."
"O: Good beer with unique flavors. I feel it did not hide it's 8% ABV very well. Almost too sweet as it could have been more balanced with a touch of bitterness. Overall, it was enjoyable and I would have another."
"I was fairly disappointed in this one. While not bad tasting by any means I just expected more from the style and brewery. On the plus side I couldn't pick up any of the 8% ABV."
"Overall: I like the color to this ale. A great ale and I would definitely drink another. My favorite part of this ale was the mouthfeel. Pleasantly surprised especially after the aroma it gave off. Dogfish is constantly wowing my platae. Cheers."
"The metallic taste leaves a horrible feeling in my mouth. I'm sure it's from the alcohol, but it tasted terrible. I couldn't finish this beer. Huge disappointment."
"Medium bodied with moderate carbonation, this beer has a smooth mouthfeel. The body is a little thick and slightly sticky. The carbonation is barely noticeable and does not seem to be strong enough to truly help this beer's drinkability."
"Overall, I think I'll skip on these next time. A mediocre beer with a high ABV. Nothing special. And where are the aromas and flavors of raisins?"
"I typically enjoy this beer when I have it at festival and whatnot. This brew poured out as a nice dark shade of brown with a creamy orange tan colored head on top. The smell of the beer is a little boozy but has a nice sweetness to it that gives off a Raisin and brown sugar aroma. The taste of the beer is pretty sweet and has lots of dark fruit and sugars in there. It's more like a dessert beer I feel personally. The mouthfeel is slick and almost oily but has a good carbonation to it still. Overall I like it, I choose it over most of the other DfH beers are festival for some reason... Not really sure why. It's worth trying!"
"O: ok not great. Not sure I'd order it again though it was enjoyable in it's own right"
"O - This ale packs a punch. An interesting twist on the Belgian ale, some may not dig it, some will love it. Try it and find out."
"O - A solid offering and a very unique beer."
"Medium bodied with medium carbonation. Interesting take on the style, but not enough balance for me to want this on a more regular basis."
"Overall, I like it. It's not overly dark and the carbonation it holds helps make it quite refreshing."
"This pours a darkish brown color with a tan head which quickly dissipates. With the smell, I get some grape, fruit, and lots of malts. Feel is medium. Taste is of grapes /raisins, dark fruit and plenty of malts, not much hop profile. Overall this is a decent beer but a little too sweet for my tastes and not one I'll get again."
"M - Medium bodied with light carbonation which I like, really smooth and pleasant to drink feels great in the mouth."
"Pours a rich mahogany color with dense, creamy medium-tan colored head. The aroma definitely features raisins, and there is also some brown sugar, caramel, and even some white wine as the beer warms. The flavor has a muddled blend of molasses, raisins, plums, a spicy combination of hops and alcohol, and even a little chocolate. The fine, selzer-like carbonation, assertive booziness, and the drying finish all distract from the flavor profile, however. Overall, this one is not quite so ""off-centered," as it actually seems mostly on-style, but the off-putting mouthfeel and alcohol presence really drags it down."
"Despite the ""pleasant but unremarkable"" vs ""high ABV"" dissonance, this beer would be great if paired with the right food. The bold aroma, reasonably distinctive flavors, and overall low flavor impact could work really well with the right culinary complement."
"Poured on-tap into a tulip, the beer is an auburn-brown color with a thin layer of off-white head. There are aromas of grape sweetness, with a sweet malt highlight. Very rich on the nose. The beer's flavor is strong, with a merlot character, and a tangy, sour fruit undertone. The aftertaste is minimal, with a bit of the fruit sweetness again. The finish is dry, and it keeps the flavors from being overpowering or cloying. Deep, dark, and heavy flavors make this one a sipper. Unique and interesting beer."
"Truly an excellent ale. It's easy to see why this one won ""American Beer of the Year"" in 2000."
"O-The beer is too unbalanced to the malt/fruit side. Overly sweet with flavors not meshing like they should."
"O - Well, I can still say I haven't had a Belgian Strong Dark Ale I disliked. This one departs from the admittedly highly variable flavor profile of this beer style. Where's the malt? It is still a moderately enjoyable if disappointing offering from DH. I'll buy another bottle but try aging it first."
"The ABV on this brew was higher than I normally tolerate, considering my checklist only allows for beers between 4%-6%, this one was 8%. It came out nice brownish hue, beautifully crafted though, the taste was sweet and fruity. A good session once only and no more, in my opinion."
"Overall, I liked this beer. It's different, but based on the reviews I read I thought I would hate it. It turns out to be a pleasant surprise. I like the choice of malts and the way the roasting highlights them. I can imagine some might find this a little too sweet, but for me the spicy alcohol balances it enough that I enjoy it. Thankfully, I have another bottle; I would like to try this on-tap."
"overall i thought this was a decent, reasonable tasty, above average beer. nothing i would go out of my way for, and definitely not the best DFH has put out, but solid."
"Not a bad beer. Definitely a unique flavor. Glad I got the chance to try it, but will probably not have again."
"A very lacklustre and very uninspired effort from Dogfish Head. Unfortunately, it falls into their regular trap of having a theoretically interesting idea that turns into a very pedestrian brew."
"Overall, it's a nice change of pace from your typical Belgian beer, but DFH has better to offer."
"Pours a deep, reddish brown color with a bit of head. Tastes and smells of malts, yeast, fruits and a bit of wine (from the raisins). It’s a pretty sweet beer on the palate, although the aftertaste is bitter. The raisins give this an interesting flavor, almost a mixture between wine and beer, makes for an interesting Belgian strong ale. Not really my style, but it’s complex and well made."
"This beer has a dark brown color body with not a lot of head to it, the head lays down quickly to a thin lace. The smell is of dark fruits and some brown sugar. The taste starts off very sweet, then a hint of raisins come through. Some hop but not a lot that i can taste. The mouth feel is kinda syrupy. Overall I'm unpressed with this beer, but glad to give it a try."
"O- A pleasant beer that is lacking a little something but still very drinkable overall. Not my favorite from dogfish but still worth trying"
"My girlfriend's mother likes to buy me beer. She bought a six pack of this, and I am still trying to think of a polite way to tell her to never buy it again for anyone. It's a sugary mess of a beer."
"It's a good beer. Well done. The appearance, smell, taste and mouthfeel all align."
"It smells a bit sour, in an estery and wine like way, and tastes like a in-between of wine and beer, carbonation is good, and doesn't really hide anything (tried it after i shaked it out) . except from that, theres no real kick in the flavors of this one, but it´s a good beer."
"Overall I thought this was a pretty average beer that I really wasn't that into. In theory it sounded like a good choice since I like that raisin taste I get from malt heavy brews but this one was just far too sweet and unbalanced for me to like. I really don't like overly sweet beers so that was what I liked the least about this beer, but the flavors in the background that I picked up when it warmed up were nice and would have suited this beer better if they took the reigns and let the sugar and alcohol take the backseat. I don't think I will buy this again, if I am craving a Belgian Strong Dark Ale I will stick with my go to brew for that style, Trois Pistoles. I can't say I recommend this brew since it doesn't do a good job at representing it's style. This beer just didn't do it for me and is now my least favorite Dogfish Head Brew, sweet and boozy just don't work for me."
"O: About what I remembered. The beer is overly heavy, overly sweet and wickedly out of balance. Really not a whole lot to recommend this beer. At least it hides the 8% pretty well."
"O: Interesting flavor, characteristics of some barley wines I've had. Probably more suitable for a winter evening."
"O - This has to be the worst Belgian Strong Dark Ale I have had to date. Smells funky. Flavors are off and carbonation is too high. I wonder if I bought a bad bottle. Glad I just purchased the single bottle."
"O: I was very impressed by this one. Really nice and pleasant to drink."
"great tasty brew..."
"Notes - i think this should probably be paired with food, and im wondering exactly what happened with this beer. I keep thinking ""maybe ill go back to it, and ill like it"" but the kind of Belgian quad or dubble thing theyre going for only works until the finish."
"Overall, full flavored but lacked in some areas, I'd get it again"
"O: A good beer and I tried to like it a lot more than I did, being a big DFH fan. However, the sticky sweet flavors and noticeable burn of the 8% ABV having an effect on the palate turned me off slightly. All in all, worth a try and maybe more suitable for cooler weather and certain desserts."
"Have been looking at this beer for a long time on the shelf and finally bought a six yesterday; wish I hadn't - have 5 more to go. As a fan of most RIS's, scottish & Belgian ales with higher abv's, i definitely think this is a fairly bland brew. The notes i sensed were the raison's, and maybe plum and some 'tangy' aftertaste. The so called ""8% burn"" wasn't really noticed. Overall, won't buy again, but will have when the good stuff is gone."
"O- its a beer to try but that is about it. I wouldn't have it again. Its unique and full of burn. Way too much compared to other 8% beers I have had."
"O: Not an overall terrible beer. If I drank this without knowing what it was, I wouldn't sayh it's great, maybe not order another but put it against other brown ales I've had and I may say it's average."
"This beer pours a clear amber color with a trace of white foamy head that doesn't retain much or lace. The aroma has hints of raisins, spice and some banana notes. The taste is similar and finishes spicy. The mouthfeel is quite overcarbonated. Overall an ok beer."
"Oh, and that Best American Beer award from 2000 came compliments of Malt Advocate Magazine....a whiskey journal....wtf."
"Overall not bad but will not order again, moving on..."
"D: I'd consider this a sipper, not because of the ABV content, but because of the strong flavor profile."
"Pours a dark chestnut red with brown and orange highlights, and a thin white lace of a head. Bready on the nose with hints of dark fruits and sour grapes, very much a strong lager backbone, with small hints of cherries. Cherries again on the tongue, smokey toasted malts, red wine character, and alcohol all over the place on this thing. Medium bodied, dry dry finish, so very sweet, tingly tongue from the carb. This isnt very good. For starters, the alcohol burns and dominates like crazy for an 8 percent beer it shouldnt do that. Second, this is s poor example of a Belgian Strong, it lacks alot of the characteristics that make this stlye awesome. I wasn't feeling this, i wouldnt turn it down, but no way will i pay for it again."
"O: Very pleasent beer in every respect. Definately not something that one would consume in large quantaties. This is a beer you savor with every sip."
"O- a little disappointing, this is just an average brew. Nothing bad here, just not up to the standards I'd expect from DFH."
"O-This beer isn't awful but I was expecting a whole lot more. It's a Dogfish Head and is supposed to be the best new beer in America and I'm just not seeing it."
"Overall an OK beer. I've never had a Belgian Strong Dark Ale, so I'm not exactly sure what to expect. After drinking a hell of a lot of this decided that its worth getting again. After all I love Dogfish Head"
"Not all that terrible, redemption comes as the beer warms but still the taste was lingering and unpleasant. Yeast and earthy, metallic hops control the flavors of the beer too much negating the sweet malts and sugars. Very hollow fruity notes that don't even explain the weird smokiness on the end."
"Medium mouthfeel and very little notice of the alcohol. A little too sweet overall for my liking, but a very interesting and worthy effort overall from DFH."
"O: This is a little odd but still flavorful and enjoyable."
"O-Overall i dont think its average rating does it justice. I find it to be very enjoyable and unique. A very good beer from a great brewery."
"Finish: Of good length and with plenty of taste. Complex but accessible. A beer that was brewed with a purpose and it succeeded."
"O - My first experiences with this beer were not positive; however, the more I examine characteristics the more I appreciate the brew. I would not openly seek this beer out, but its definitely worth a try. Definite points for uniqueness, but this beer is trending away from classic styles in typical Dogfish Head fashion. Still an interesting experiment for jaded beer drinkers."
"O: DFH's Raison D'etre is simply an off-the-wall kinda brew. I really love the complexity this one has. The way it balances the dark fruits and the flavor profiles of the Belgian Strong is really well done. Though it's not my favorite in the DFH stable, it's one I'll certainly return to. Thumbs up - well done Señor Calagione!"
"Overall - A odd, strange tasting mess. Too many differnt flavors and too sweet. The roasted malts really throw this beer off. WOuld like more of a fruit presence with the sugars and rasin flavor. Not a good balanced beer, ill pass on this one."
"O: A nice attempt at a belgian dark with DFH's signature twists and turns. A unique take on the Belgian Strong Dark and one that I enjoy once or twice a year but not much more frequently than that."
"O- Tried and not in a hurry to drink the 5 other buddies of this guy that came in a 6 pack for $12"
"Overall it was fine to drink and goes pretty dang easy for a strong 8% ABV beer."
"Poured reddish-brown, hazy with a bit of a head. Fruits and sugars in the nose. Dried fruits (raisins, of course) on the tongue right up front. Light sugars, and sweet malt, graininess in the background, and somewhat of a phenol or alcohol taste, even though the ABV is not that high. Medium mouthfeel with a syrupy sensation. Definitely drinkable, but not something I'd want to drink all the time."
"Overall this is a well played brew and certainly worth a try and especially so by those that prefer ths style of beer. Enjoy!!!"
"D/O: As a beer by itself, it is decent. Pair it up with some burgers or a steak with spices, and it becomes a different, better beer. Gotta knock it again for the alcohol, though. It just isn't hidden as well as it could be"
"Average finish that is a little more bitter than the sweetness you get up front from this beer. Full body, thick on the palate. Interesting flavors and complexities here."
"Definitely a sipper, but this one's unique, tasty, and memorable. A triumph."
"Cheers!"
"Poured a nice copper color with a white, thick head. Your nose gets hit with the rasins, very sweet aromoa with a mild sourness to the beer. At first sip you get hit with the sweetness followed up with a smooth warming effect of the alcohol that finishes with a bitter earthy somewhat woodsy taste. This is a very easy to drink beer that leave a slight dry feeling in the mouth but still very easy to drink. Over all a very good beer, full of a varity of flavors and feelings as you consume"
"D: Nice and easy to drink. Flavors are pleasant... not strong, so I could down a few of these. Not very complex, but a good beer."
"D: doesnt taste like an 8%'er. much lighter in my opinion. not really a strong bel. dark. just missing something. not quite enough in the nose or on the palate."
"Overall, a good beer from Dogfish but not great for the style. Maybe if it were not so filtered you'd get more of that belgian feel."
"O- Easy drinking, hides the alcohol well, it’s an interesting beer, not one I would return to any time soon."
"I appreciate how the dark, raisiny sweetness was kept in check here. It’s not complex, but it’s decent."
"Overall - Complex in design, but not quite as much so in the actual taste...but only because I couldn't pull out some of the flavors that they list on the bottle, which may very well be MY fault and not the brewery's. Still, very nice tasting and interesting to sample."
"Overall - Really enjoyable beer. Especially for the price. Poor man's Chimay Blue. I want to rate this beer higher, but I must grade according to style, so that's the only reason why this beer doesn't have 4.5 across the board."
"DFH never dissapoints a beer geek and they did it again with this one. It's become one of many staples to my beer consumption, as it is popping up in more bottle shops now than ever."
"Poured this ale from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. The beer poured a hazy dark red color. It produced a white head, however head retention was below average. Lacing for this ale was very much above average as it left lots of rings. The aroma of the ale smelled of raisins, prunes, and alochol. The beer was big bodied but the mouthfeel was less then ideal. This beer was very syurpey and high in alochol. The taste was very malty and a mix of green grapes and prunes. This was my first example of a Belgian Strong Dark Ale- while I won't seek this out, it was a fun beer to try."
"Overall - DFH continues to underwhelm me. Not sure why their stuff does not seems to resonate with me like it does with others. This ended up as a drain-pour as I could not see forcing this down with 40-50 other good beers on hand, as options."
"D - Meh. It's okay. I have to complement DFH's ability to hide the ABV in this one; didn't look at the bottle until I finished and was really surprised to see the 8% on there. Feels more like 4-5%."
"O: Not my favorite, overly grapey and sweet. Glad there are plenty of other DFH brews I can get instead."
"Pours a golden mahogany with an off white head that quickly dissipates and has little to no lacing. Smells very lager like with a bit of malt and raisin. Taste is kind of similar. The raisin hits you up front, but then fades off into an off putting bitterness. Not a bad beer, but definitely not one of there better offerings."
"O- An interesting flavored ale with a strong aroma"
"Prost!!!"
"Overall this is a steller beer. Great mix of belgian and american ales."
"D: a likeable enough Belgian styled beer, but it is lacking depth overall."
"Overall meh, the herbal hops hit quite a bit, little minerality, plenty of malts, sweet"
"Not really what I expected from the description on the bottle. But I could drink several of these in a row as I really like the taste, which could be dangerous at 8%."
"O (D) - I don't love it as much as I used to, but it's still pretty good. Not a spot-on representation of the style, but it's not that far off. It's a fine beer."
"Had no idea what the ABV was while I was drinking this (intentionally didn't look) and I was really surprised that this is 8% abv, the alcohol is very well masked, I would have assumed this was in the 5-6 range."
"O: Seeing as I'm not a huge fan of raisins, I was pleased to see that this beer wasn't over-the-top raisiny. Still, this struck me as a beer that might be worth trying out as a novelty, but not as something that I would drink on any regular basis. Nor could I see having more than one in a sitting. Not a bad beer, just not really my style."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with good carbonation, pretty drinkable. Not the best of this brewery, but still a good beer!"
"D - It is a drinkable belgian-style beer, but it just wasn't for me."
"Drinkability: THis was a disappointment. By far my least favorite of the Dogfish Head lineup. Try it if you want to, but it's not a ""gotta have""."
"An odd spice lingers over this one that doesn't quite make it unpleasant, but makes me want to give it time to cellar and maybe mellow a bit."
"D- Not bad, I can appreciate what Dogfish does with their ales."
"The head is very light and frothy but the lacing is perfect and gives a nice touch to the appearance, which is a very dark amber red/brown."
"worth trying if you can score a single vs. the 'spensive 4 pack."
"D: Maybe just a bit on the too sweet side. It is good, don't get me wrong but you have to be in the mood for this beer. Would go great with dessert."
"Poured a rich medium brownish red with a very small white head that was fully diminishing and had fair lacing. The aroma was heavy of dark roasted malts, light resin hops and a doughy sweet yeast with strong notes of coffee, dark chocolate and raisons. It tasted lightly bitter-sweet and quite malty in the beginning and finished about the same with notes coffee, chocolate and the sweetness of dried fruit. Mouthfeel was medium to full in body and dry in texture with a flat carbonation. Overall an outstanding, flavorful brew. Worth drinking many, many more !!!!"
"A medium body. Relatively slick on the palate. I'm struggled to finish this one."
"Notes: I would really suggest trying this one after a good meal. It really is a tour de force on its own, and might be a bit much on an empty stomach."
"Overall a OK beer, though not particularly balanced. Certainly overrated, its unclear what the brewer's vision was."
"I really like this beer. I would definitely buy this again. Another solid outing by Dogfish Head."
"Easy drinking but it's too sweet to session. Very good but not excellent."
"D: Has some interesting flavor notes but nothing unbelieveable. Completely underwhelming in the nose after the pour leaves nothing to compare the flavors too"
"D - Pretty solid effort, DFH. This one may have exotic ingredients and inspiration, but the resulting brew is very palate-friendly."
"Bottled on 03/25/10. Served from bottle into a Duck-Rabbit snifter. Poured a deep ruby red with a one finger off-white head that subsided to a minimal amount quickly. There was no lacing evident throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, dark fruit, and sugar. The flavor was of sweet malt, dark fruit, brown sugar, and slight alcohol. It had a medium feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. The flavor was very well balanced with no sign of alcohol anywhere to be found. Not sure if it was the ~1 year of age in my cellar or what, but I found this one to be very subtle on alcohol and all of the other flavors were very nice and robust. Never would have guessed at the 8% ABV. This one is definitely worth trying now and putting a few back for a year or so as I did if you have the patience that is."
"D: I'd be one and done with this one. Not my favorite example of a BSDA. I'm a fan of DFH, but not too impressed with this one."
"In general, there are better examples of the style. Though not a bad beer, if you're looking for a strong dark Belgian ale, there are more interesting choices, and if you're looking for a Dogfish Head beer, there are more interesting choices."
"D. Drinks much stronger than an 8% ABV beer, having said that it is very drinkable indeed. Love its warming character."
"Sweet but not overly so; the sweet/dry combination is very nice; alcohol a little too out front."
"D - I was bracing for a sipper but this one actually went down fairly quickly."
"Personally, this was a big disappointment - I'd been wanting to try this beer for about 5 years, and finally got the chance. I'm sure that some of my disappointment is due to my hopeful expectations, but I've reviewed it fairly (if anything, more than fairly). It lacks the richness and other general traits of this style of beer, and frankly, it is rather boring. Definitely not up there with the many other (generally excellent, or at least interesting) DFH beers that I've had."
"I had a hard time getting into this one. I didn't think that it was a bad beer at all, it was just something that didn't appeal to me."
"This is definitely a different beer. Have to commend Dogfish for brewing some really unique ale's."
"D-drinks quite easily for an 8% beer. the fact that i kept picking up new flavors as i tasted it, made this beer very enjoyable. this is the first time i reviewed this beer, but i've had it many times and i'm sure i'll have it many times again!"
"Overall, I think this is a relatively enjoyable beer, but not great. Not my favourite DFH by any measure, and if it is truly considered a BSDA, it is not a sterling example of one. I have to question its categorization, because it bears very little similarity to others of that style, in my opinion."
"Eh. Pretty drinkable. Probably my least DFH I've ever had, but that's much of a knock. Still not a bad ale."
"I love this beer. Very unique and it works. Will definitely be purchasing again."
"D - It wouldn't be my first option, but I wouldn't turn one down if it was my only option. It lacks the refreshing quality that I enjoy in a beer."
"D-The %8 is hid quite well. That beings said, I do not consider this to be a beer I would ever purchase (received a sixpack as a gift). Happy to try it for free, other than that, I won't be throwing money towards more of this."
"Not very drinkable in my opinion. If it was toned down a little it would be a decent beer."
"Both on tap and 12 oz bottle poured into pint glass. Pours deep mahogany with a medium off white head. Nose is yeasty, fruity and nutty. Hints of spices and malt. Taste is yeasty, fruity and malty. A bit sweet but not too much. Some spices. Finish is a bit sweet and a tiny bit bitter. Quite drinkable. Almost no trace of alcohol. Well made, sessionnable, nice example of the style (from what I can tell)."
"This beer is really unique but the sweet dark fruit notes are a bit too prominent, overpowering the dark malt flavor that I prefer in this style. The ABV is well masked and it's decently drinkable but it's not as well balanced as I would have liked."
"Overall, Raison D'Être is a decent attempt at reproducing a BSDA, but it lacks a lot of components that the best of them have. It's too alcoholic and it lacks the complex flavor that is characteristic of BSDAs. It does become a bit more laid back as it warms, though it's still not up to snuff. I'm glad I tried it, but there are other BSDAs I'd reach for before I had this again."
"Overall I really do not care for this beer. It tastes like a terrible attempt at a Dubbel that turned into a hot, fusel mess."
"The mouthfeel and drinkability are both solid, it's medium bodied with a bit of a crisper body. The drinkability is also solid, the Belgian yeasts kind of grate on me personally. A solid brew from Dogfish Head."
"D - Drinkability is moderate. This beer has a lot going for it in the nose, but the taste is just a bit out of balance for me. A little bit of reduction in the alcohol heat and a tad more balance with the other notes from the nose and this beer is a winner, especially for the price point. Currently it's not a bad beer, and the first few tastes are great, but as it comes to temperature it falters a bit."
"D: Extremely drinkable. With I had a few more."
"D: a nice belgian beer, some interesting flavors. Very drinkable but not a typical belgian."
"DB- With warmth, the raisin and alcohol flavors just keep building. I find it to be a bit one dimensional in that sense and a one bottle thing."
"Overall OUTSTANDING!!"
"I could keep a 6 pack in the fridge and not get sick of it. Overall a good beer."
"D: Somewhat sweet and malty beer. Finish is ok, but would prevent me from having 2 in a row, though I'd have again at another sitting."
"D: Very good! At 8% ABV, it doesn't taste like it. The sweetness doesn't bother me as much as other people have complained about. I could drink quite a few of these."
"Drink- This is unique and I liked it. A bit sweet but a well rounder beer."
"I usually like dogfish brews but this one just didn't appeal to me. It's certainly unique but the alcohol is surprisingly present and the sweetness is too intense."
"Overall, unique beer with different scents and flavors, but it was just too sweet without any dryness to keep me from coming back anytime soon."
"All the alcohol hints don't really hurt drinkability in a one bottle context. The raisins aren't blaring. This just seems like a decent BSDA."
"Overall, a unique beverage, but not one that is particularly drinkable. The 8% ABV is masked quite well underneath the flavor of the beer, and is not overwhelming at all. The flavors linger for some time, and the beer finishes with some interesting elements."
"D - I'm about two thirds of the way through a 12-oz bottle, and though I'm planning to finish it, I'd say one during an evening is plenty. Although not ""heavy"" in mouthfeel, Raison d'Etre does sit a little heavy in the belly...definitely not one I'd grab after mowing the lawn on a hot summer day, but quite tasty on a chilly winter evening."
"Drinkability: Maybe with the right meal I could make this work, but I've had far better Belgian Dark Ales, and this by itself in a snifter isn't great. Maybe it's meant to be in a different glass and the smell and taste is different. But I'm not liking it and it is a bit of a chore to finish. Oh well - one cannot like every beer you come across."
"Good all around except the scent is not noticeable enough."
"I've always loved this beer! It's hard classify the style, but the bottom line is its' well crafted. Outstanding beer to get year-round. Recommended."
"D - I have no trouble drinking the one here in front of me but I really expected more from Dogfish. I would like to try this on a nitro-tap to see if it is any different but this will not be my first choice for a Belgian strong dark. On the other hand, it is a beautiful beer to look at."
"Drinkability is fairly good. A solid, if unspectacular example of a Belgian Strong Dark Ale. I can always count on Dogfish Head to put out an interesting, off-beat brew and this is definitely one of them. It doesn't have the complexity and oomph of proper Belgian monastery beers like Rochefort and Chimay, but it's still a worthwhile thing to sit back and drink."
"Bonus: I ate a Hungry Man fried chicken dinner (fried chicken, mashed potatoes, corn and a brownie) and let me say that this beer washed everything down perfectly."
"D - Could have a few, not too alcoholic."
"The drink on this is pretty decent. For some drinkers it might become heavy, as well well as the alcohol burn might turn a few away. I am a huge fan of DFH beers, and once again, they have not let me down. This was my first time on this brew and I will of course at it to my regulars. Thanks DFH."
"The taste is of this is a brow initially sweet crystal malts. Come with the carbonation a sweet berry flavor enter as the carbonation exits and the berry taste remains. A slight alcohol on the palate lingers"
"This beer poured a rich mahogany, very translucent with a light beige colored head that quickly dissipated and laced the glass. This beer didn't smell like any fruit like others have said but kind of has a mild brown sugar, molasses like sweet malt scent to it. It's one of those smells that I just am not a fan of. The taste is of sweet malt and beet sugar. Personally I do not like it, think it's kinda gross, but I get what they were going for. It's just an over malted ale to me. I'm not getting any raisin at all. Like a lot of DFH's beers, this drinks exceptionally smooth. I just can't like this. It's flavors are odd and the 8% is pretty noticeable. The bottle says it was brewed with a sense of purpose. So I ask, what WAS the purpose?"
"d. No idea yet. Will have to revisit this beer- Probably with a meal or snack. Not a beer Id sit and order at a bar. But not Bad..."
"Drink - A nice beer that works well as a winter warmer. The alcohol is well hidden and it has a lot of taste. I'm not sure I could handle more than 1 of these in a night, but I'd drink it again for sure."
"Overall: Although out of my normal comfort zone (hoppy pilsners?), I like this beer. Definitely a beer to sip for me."
"Just Decent."
"Drinkability: I'm a fan of Belgian Dark Ales and I can drink these all night easily. As far as Fruity beers goes this one is a winner, slight fruity taste that balances well with the other flavors, unlike some other fruity beers I've tried that don't taste natural or are totally out of balance with the yeast and malt flavors."
"Overall, definitely, a well above average brew, just a little too sweet and not enough bitter."
"D - Pretty darn good for the ABV. I don't love this beer, but am glad I tried it."
"Tastes very sweet on the backend, the raisons really come through, almost overpowering the beer though. Slight bitter aftertaste. The high alcohol content is hidden well though. Mouthfeel is good, as is the consistancy. Drinkability wouldn't rank very high due to the overpowering sweetness on the backend. Overall, pretty good brew."
"for being a lighter fairly wel carbonated beer it is surprsingly heay and a slow drinker with medium drinability"
"D - Average. It's strong and sweet, so maybe 1 more, but not multiple."
"Not my favorite Dogfish product. It's not bad but I wouldn't go out of my way to get it. A previous taster used the word ""NyQuil"" to describe it and it really does have almost medicinal overtones to it."
"I wanted to like this more than I did. It is an interesting beer but I couldn't help thinking of NyQuil the whole time. The syrupy malt drowned out everything except the alcohol."
"D: The overall lightness of this beer makes it very drinkable."
"Not my absolute favorite beer, but definitely good. Can't quite put a finger on what's missing, but it's just not something I couldn't live without. Overall, a very fine brew."
"D- Its easily drinkable but this is not a very good example of the style, it makes a better brown ale. Flavour profile is faint and underwhelming with a lifeless body. No thanks!"
"OK, not sold on this one. Not enough there to be a BSDA but a bit revved up to be a straight brown ale. Don't know where it was aiming, but it missed."
"IMO Dogfish head has too many good beers to spend your money on this one."
"I found this beer to be quiet drinkable. I could have seen myself easily sitting back and enjoying a few of these!"
"The sweetness is complimented nicely with a balanced bitter finish. A fine dark ale, so tasty I could drink it all night."
"D - Don't know if I would drink several but it was an interesting ale to say the least and it looks damn pretty in the glass"
"D- Very drinkable. Medium body with nice flavor profile. Simple and refreshing."
"This one gets better as I sip. D train likes the complexity of this strong ale. And of course the 8% abv doesn't hurt."
"Two finger head of very light brown bubbles, working it's way down to a clinging lace. Color is a 17 on the SRM Beer Color Chart. Smells of raisins, prunes, peach, apricots, and malt. Tastes of raisins, prunes, apricot, peach, barley, wheat, and malt. Not heavy in my mouth, sort of lacks real body. A little sweet to drink with a meal of pot roast, but might be good with sweeter dishes, i.e. sweet and sour or teriyaki chicken, or honey ham. Overall a well balanced flavor with a little tart jab on the end. Slightly pricey, but will enjoy at medium to high end affairs."
"Poured a massive head of tiny bubbles which took a long while to dissipate. Smelled of caramel. Mouthfeel and sugars do have a Belgian influence as the label suggests. Honestly I don't taste much of the raisins though with a little imagination I could say it has a drop of prune."
"overall, this is much better after 2 years of age on it. a lot of the harsh qualities are gone. but i still couldnt see drinking more than one of these at time and not really worth buying again. if you have the space in your cellar and lots of patience, go for it, age a few, but i really wouldnt go out of my way to do so again."
"This beer is a dark amber color with a white head. The aroma is of caramel malt, a hint of chocolate malt, and raisons. The flavor is sweet, a hint of chocolate malt and sweet caramel malt. Also there is a flavor like belgian candi sugar. The mouthfeel is medium light. Overall this is a drinkable beer."
"I wanted to like this beer more than I did. seems just a little off. Maybe more carbonation? Less?"
"D-Very drinkable, and unique for its style. True to the Dogfish Moto"
"Its good. I'd buy it again. Strong Dark Belgian Ale in 6 pack. What more can you want?"
"Overall, the best things about this beer are its rich, deep coloring, and the conservative use of some of the more outlandishly sweet ingredients. This beer certainly has the potential to be offensively sweet, but due to careful craftsmanship it remains a curious and ultimately agreeable find."
"Overall: Honestly? A very solid brew. I don't understand the hate this beer gets. True its not really true to style, but its a very tasty and original brew. Approach this with an open mind and I'm sure you won't be disappointed."
"This is unique, and it definitely took about half the glass for it to grow on me. Definitely worth trying, but I'll probably pass this up in favor for more traditional ales."
"I have had this beer multiple times and I really enjoy it. The raisins are dominant in the aroma and flavor and the additional elements such as brown sugar compliment the raisins well."
"Notes: A very drinkable beer one that I would pick up again. Cheers."
"Would be glad to drink it again but probably only one at a time."
"Taken on a rainy afternoon in july 2010. Served in a gouden carolus goblet. Look: Purplish, reddish, very bright color, like a glass of red wine, ephemeral head with acceptable lacing. Smell: strong character of coffee malt, sugar and raisins. Taste: Lots of coffee malt sweetened with grape passes and a spicy hop background. Mouthfeel: Very bitter, creamy, viscous body and little gasification, no noticeable the degree of alcohol. Drinkability: a strong belgian style with a lot of coffeee, an excellent way to hide the abv."
"Probably won't be a repeat buyer of this..."
"Pours a nice deep amber/brown with a small tan head. Aroma is sweet spices, caramel malts, some fruitiness. Taste is sweet caramel malt, sweet spices, some dried fruit, caramel and breadiness and some light bitter hops. Palate is nice full body, nice carbonation, rich creamy texture. Finish is sweet malty caramel, dried fruit some breadiness with some light bitterness to add balance. Overall a very nice, drinkable brew"
"Very drinkable beer, but hard to pick out the nuances that make it different. They are so subtle, that it doesn't really come off as ""different."" Otherwise a good example, if not a bit too light colored, of a belgian strong dark ale."
"D - This is a great sipper, almost like a Rochefort with raisins added. Can't see myself drinking more then one in a sitting, though."
"This Belgian Strong Ale housed a thick dark head, a brown/amber color. The smell was reminiscent of Syrah wine, meaning that it was sweet, but sweet like how a good wine (or wino (Google image search wino)) smells. This is a thick beer, and given the immediate raisin taste, one that would serve as its own dessert. A hoppy-sweet aftertaste, with a smokiness that seals off the drink. explicitly enjoyable. You should take your time and enjoy this beer. The perfect sweet level, this beer is very complex and very well layered."
"M/D - soft alcohol sting, somewhat easy on the mouth. not too thick, not too watery...pretty even feeling. not my fav BSDA, but i do admire DFH for what they do and this brew is their take on it so it carries some sort of their general flavoring (a few breweries have this with all of their beers and DFH is one)."
"Fairly drinkable on a cold day, very sweet and fruity, with the alcohol to warm you up."
"Drinkability: I had heard a lot about how this beer was supposed to be ""different"" and ""provocative"" because they used unorthodox ingredients in it. Unfortunately, I don't think it really lives up to that reputation. What you get is a relatively straight forward Belgian ale. It is a bit on the sweet side and the hops don't come out as much as they usually do but it's still a pretty typical Belgian ale. I'm glad I gave it a try but I don't think it's something I'll ever get again."
"Drinkability- Full flavor covers big alcohol presence. No burn and little warmth produced. A nice interesting leadoff to a tasting session. Still ABV limits drinkability."
"Deep red to, well mahagony in color. Some decent but not to sticky lacing hangs around. The aroma presents cherries, licorice, belgian candy sugar some grapyness as well as a touch of tobacco and this odd raw aroma. The flavor follows from the aroma, however the flavors don't mesh all too well and there is that rawness to this beer. It is also a tad hot and harsh, and again that tobacco flavor is present too. This beer could be a little more full bodied as it presents itself a little thin. I'd think twice before picking up another sixer of these guys."
"Pours dark amber with a lasting off-white head. Aroma of caramel malt and ripe fruit with hints of piney hops. Full, tangy body. The flavors are rich caramel malt, ripe fruit, brown sugar with hops provide perfect balance. Some alcohol notes. Long, massive bitter-sweet finish. Delicious, rich brew."
"All in all, it drinks with ample carbonation but nil bite, and soft silky feel. I'm not always going to be in the mood for this, but it's just so damn good and it's almost surprising how I come back to it time and time again and never get tired of it."
"Overall: A good beer that brings the malt without being cloying. Hearty for sure. Would be great with a robust, herb-crusted pork roast."
"I really, really like this beer. Very delicious and well rounded. The BSDA category can be pretty varied at times, and this ranks among the most drinkable there is. Wonderfully fruity and sweet without being cloying."
"D - overall a quality beer; surprisingly smooth but compared to other Dogfish head beers the lack of aftertaste bite kind of feels they didn't give this the same 'total package' drink-ability some of the other Dogfish brews are know for (60-minute IPA) have; I felt like I was always looking for a little more flavor with every gulp"
"Unless presented with a Miller Lite sans vortex."
"Pours a dark amber color with a small head that left a small amount of lacing as it fell. There were also a lot of carbonation bubbles visible. It smelled sweet and of caramel. There were also notes of Raisins and prunes. The taste was pretty sweet and had notes of caramel, prunes, and raisins. Tasted pretty much like the smell. You could also taste the alcohol pretty well. The mouthfeel was good. Medium body with medium carbonation, and it went down smooth. The drinkability was decent on this one. It went down pretty smooth, but I would have liked it more if there was some hop character to cut some of the sweetness and maybe if the alcohol taste was masked a bit. I would try it again though."
"Overall impression: tasty and alcoholic but lacking in body. great for the price, though."
"D - I quite enjoyed this beer although sessioning this one is out of the question."
"D: tasty, solid beer from DFH, and despite the really sweet flavor and 8% ABV I could drink quite a few in a sitting"
"Bottle. Pours a deep mahagony rust color with very minimal head. The aroma is rather sweet but over than that is fairly minimal. The taste is very smooth but nothing outstanding. Starts off sweet and stays that way the entire time. Fruit like flavors like raisins and slight banana. Medium mouthfeel. Meh, not that great."
"D - somewhat disappointed by the dominance of the alcohol, and the flavour was more like the dunkle's I recently had in Germany than a Belgian, not a bad beer but not really what I was expecting"
"M: Medium to smooth body with a light carbonation. Gives way to a dry and estery finish."
"Beer was much darker than I anticipated however, not overwhelming malt characteristics. I could not really detect any of the green raisin flavor. Overall, it was a beer that I tried on a whim and I really enjoyed it. Dogfish always manages to make unique styles that I am always willing to indulge in."
"M- Lots of carbonation brings this medium bodied beer down a little bit."
"This was an ok Belgian, the flavor was a bit weak, I'm not sure if I will revisit this one. There are plenty of other Belgians I would prefer."
"D - The aroma is a bit weak, but the favor of this beer is surprisingly spot of for the style. The raisins bring a musty fruitiness that works well with the rich, dark caramel malt. There is an excellent yeasty note of red apple that floats throughout the experience and enhances the malt character substantially. The hops are handled nicely as well and manage to provide a light balancing bitterness without obscuring any of the malt or yeast. A very nicely drinkable belgian with an American twist."
"Poured from the bottle into my favorite snifter. Light brown fluffy head quickly dissipated and minimal lacing. Lovely sweet malt smell with a tiny bit of fruit, but not necessarily raisin. The taste was delicious malt with a touch of hops and a nice sweetness. Mouthfeel was medium heavy with tiny bubbles. The drinkability was good. I didn't get any raisin until the aftertaste. This brew had a lot going on. Nice, unique."
"Glad to try it, but this isn't a DFH brew I'll get again."
"Drinkability -- Good, but far from world-class. Unique enough to be worth trying."
"Raison d'etre? Yep, I can see this has purpose. It's not bad at all. It just needs some inspiration."
"D: An interesting brew, but not especially noteworthy. It's got a good base, but not much else. I think this beer might be more apt for a meal than as a stand-alone sipper. I could see it going well with grilled red meat, but it doesn't cut it now when I'm just sipping."
"For a Dogfish Head beer, it is not the best, but I give higher marks as this is a great beer for it's lower-than-average cost. You're definitely getting a deal on this one. Great fireside beer. I would finally recommend a pork loin as a meal choice for this beer."
"cheers"
"Seems like a lack of cohesion here, some good elements present but they aren't working together in any semblance of balance or harmony."
"The taste is strong upfront and quickly mellows with a long dry raison finish. A very good spin on the Belgian Stong! Subtle medium mouthfeel, goes down watery. Tastes like it may be a sipper. The 8% is apparant but overall it's a pleasing beer. I'll probably save the rest of these to accompany a well made dinner. Moderate drinkability puts this at ""will pick up again'."
"Drinkability- very easy drinking beer, good balance and well hidden 8 percent, very easy and dangerously smooth drinking, the beer certainly lacks a little in complexity compared to some other belgian dark ales but its a great value and extremely easy drinking, world class nah but overall a pretty nice beer for the price and value a certain good buy,"
"Overall: I like this. Not my favorite Dogfish Head though."
"Pours a nice clear mahogany red, with a finger of the lightest of tans foam that quickly fades into nothing but a slight film. The aroma initially has the tartness of the golden raisins, but is quickly overpowered and masked by the caramel malts. In addition there is the pleasant aroma of honey which is muddled by the smell of liquor on the back of the nostrils. The taste is of caramel malts and the booze. There is a significant bitterness that goes with both. There is the distinct flavor of golden honey which is this beers saving grace. The aftertaste is the only place that you'll find the raisin flavor. The bitter astringent nature is more akin to an Old Ale than the BSDA. It's drinkable in the sense that you can consume it no problem if you sip it. Dear lord don't drink it too fast. Too much on the mouth makes this beer taste worse. Having said all of that it's still a good beer, but it's a one time thing for me."
"Lighter than expected mouthfeel but I could definately drink more than one."
"Overall- A unique beer. I'm glad I've tried it but I don't plan on purchasing it again. DFH creates so many other beers that I just love but this one I feel is fairly average.As I stated above DFH is an outstanding brewery with a stellar lineup but I feel this is one of their weaker beers."
"I had the Raison D'etre at the Dogfish Head in Gaithersburg. It has a nice dark orange colour and once it was bought to our table it had very little head. It mainteained a light lacing around the edge of the glass though. The smell is mostly of yeast with a hint of sweet caramel. The main taste here is a sweet, dark caramel flavour which I assume is from the beet sugar and the raisons. There is also a nice roasty malt flavour in there too. This beer feels great in the mouth sue to the nice thick texture and the good carbonation. I really interesting and tasty beer."
"I don't know what people are talking about when they say they can smell the alcohol or even taste the alcohol in this one. Its so well masked for 8 percent and it doesn't even have that many hops to cover up that alcohol! Which is very impressive. It smells like a dark fruit and can definitely pick up the raison smell. Behind those smells is a very deep rich roasted malt. The taste has that deep rich sweet malt backing and the raisons and hops come together to have that earthy very slight bitter finish. Very well crafted. I hardly taste any alcohol in this as well. That doesn't mean though that you can't feel it. At 8 percent its a high alcohol beer so you can only have a few which is its only downfall. At least you'll be keeping the 6 pack longer than you usually would though! Also its good they put this in 6 packs instead of 4 packs. Very good decision. Thanks Dogfish Head for turning me onto more tastes than I never knew I would like."
"I guess that is the beauty of each person having their own taste and likes."
"I was expecting more from this beer, it appeared more interesting than it actually tasted."
"D - I could handle one every now and then as a departure from the IPA's and RIS' that I usually drink."
"d- its very drinkable something i could pour into glass everyday very happy i came across this one"
"Why, yes! I'll have another! Thanks!"
"Taste: Green fruit-black pepper-grassy funk-burnt malt. The sweetness up front is blasted away by the green fruit, black pepper, burnt malt taste that dominates the flavor. Fairly complex flavors but there isn't much that I enjoy. If you like these flavors then it could be enjoyable. For me, it could have been worse but this a borderline bad beer. Blech!"
"Overall: Dark, rich, and complex, especially when given some time to develop."
"D- Drinkable; a little hot"
"The drinkability is awesome especially with the high abv, it's very delicious."
"Chalk up the results of this experiment as ""inconclusive""."
"D: Tasty, all-around, but doesn't stand up to it's own hype. If they could get it to smell like it tastes, this would be a much more enjoyable beverage."
"D= I really wouldn't want to drink a lot of these and would basically save them to drink during a cold winter night."
"Notes: The first thing thing that came to my mind when I tried this was another DFH brew, the India Brown Ale. If you enjoyed that beer I think you would enjoy this one as well."
"D- The syrup and alcohol burn are a bit much, just making it so-so"
"The dogfish line is pretty awesome stuff."
"for a dark belgian ale, I would expect it to be more rich, creamy with a deeper complexity. seems to not blend well... a little imbalanced."
"Drinkability: A pretty good and enjoyable brew, with some interesting characteristics. However, this one could do with weaker alcohol notes, which make this brew harder to drink. Still worth a try, not a first choice for me, but pretty good."
"Overall a little disappointing, I'm a huge fan of DFH and haven't found much not to like about them. This just wasn't my cup of tea and won't be pursuing again."
"Overall i would not buy this beer again. I'm hoping that i just got an old bottle as most i've had from Dogfish were of a higher quality. Make sure yours is a newer bottle that's been taken care of."
"D: Could go for another but not sure how many I would have in a session. Probably no more than 2."
"It looked a nice enough deep bronze, but the smell was mostly caramel, and then the taste was a lot of interesting notes that never came together into a cohesive whole--instead of the alcohol warming and blending the flavors, I found that it just cut through them. Raw alcohol, green raisins, sweet sugar-caramel, rum--intriguing flavors, but not brought together into a beer. The mouthfeel was surprisingly nice for all that, but I always found this beer too sweet and alcoholic to really enjoy."
"D: Incredibly smooth for 8%. Sweet and strong and smooth, this beer is excellent to sit down and enjoy almost anywhere."
"D - Quite drinkable. The sweetness would keep me from having more than 2 consecutively but I'd be willing to bring a 6-pack of this to a party of non-craft beer drinkers and I think it'd convert some people."
"Try this beer."
"The mouthfeel was light for the style, but I thought it fit nicely and made it quite drinkable."
"D- Not a bad beer. It is definitely an experimental beer. While it's not the best beer out there, it is an interesting take on the style."
"Not a good example of a Belgian strong dark. Innovative, yes, unbalanced, also yes unfortunately. My second least favorite Dogfish Head beer only to the disaster that is Festina Peche."
"D: Highly drinkable for such a strong beer, sweetness is definitely there but not overpowering."
"Malty, sugary aroma. Raisins are here with some malty sweetness. Not brown sugar necessarily, but there is a caramelized character to it. Rich in a way. Some fruity yeast character, somewhat general and I cant quite place it. Taste it much of the same, with a bit more of this fruity raisin flavor than in the aroma, but mostly malty with a slight toasty/hearty nuttiness detected. Full mouthfeel with low carbonation, a bit heavy feeling at times, though I keep trying to remind myself that this is 8%. Not much desire to keep drinking it as my glass sits around the halfway point. Not a bad beer, but there are many others in their portfolio that I would rather have. I can only assume that this would be much better paired with a hearty meal."
"d - An ok dark ale, but wasn't the biggest fan of the taste. Probably wouldn't seek out again."
"D- Sam sure knows how to mesh ingredients together to make them work and this beer works. Let's drink this again."
"d- it feels drinkable...but the alcohol content will soon catch up with you...great beer!!!...not what I expected but...thats exactly what I wanted!"
"Overall a tasty brew. Not as good as some, perhaps most, Belgian Strong Dark Ales, but compared to those it has a terrific price and is readily available. All other things being equal would I rather drink Rochefort 6 compared to this? Yes. Are all other things equal? No."
"drinkability is ok - while the overall flavor of the beer is good its just not a belgian dark - reminds me more of dfh punkin"
"The brewers site sais this beer was designed as the pair for a nice steak. I tried two bottles (one with a steak, and one without) and can agree to the fact that is a very nice pairing brew. The steak-parterned beer was much more enjoyable and seem to have a stronger kick of flavors. This reviews scores reflect a combination of both tastings."
"Can't wait to brew one and try other brewery's interpretations of this style."
"a really terrible nose of grit, protein finger nails raisins, booze at first. then brown sugar and rose water. there is a nice mild sweet sugar quality to it though. palate is quite base with a rich sweetness but a poor body. that booze sort of comes through even. a bit smooth sweet and earthy nothing that is in the nose... good or bad. just solid and sort of soft on the tongue for the expected range... really do like the sugar quality though."
"D - For an 8% abv beer, this is unbelievably easy to drink. The taste of alcohol is non-existent in this, making it a very dangerous drink. I had bought a six back before this and almost lost it after drinking 5 bottles by mistake. Pay attention to how many you take down because you'll pay if you don't."
"Overall, I will only be drinking older vintages of this brew from now on. Age has suited this brew nicely."
"It's a deep amber beer with a reluctant off-white head. Minimal bubbles rising up. Sweet raisin, fig, and caramel nose, with a sort of fruitcake belgiany feel going on as well. The body and taste of this beer is quite week. A warmer, creamier body would do worlds of good for this. The finish is pretty good. It's got a toasty caramel and smoke note. I won't be jumping out of any airplanes to try this again."
"D- Medium body, very smooth, stands up well to hearty flavors. Good drinkability, but I don't know if I could have more than two or three of these in one sitting. Worth trying when you find it."
"-notes from 01/07"
"D - It I probs would only have one of these."
"D: Great beer overall and certainly capable of being complimented with a complex dinner pairing. The higher ABV prevents me from being able to drink many though, maybe two in a setting."
"D - Sure this is a session beer. if you're a sailor or a lumberjack."
"Drinkability: Very tasty, somewhat strong. I purchased a whole case of this fine Dogfish Head brew and its nearly gone. Lovely stuff."
"Value: Would not buy this again for over $7.99."
"Very easy to drink and moreish (meaning: wanting more), I liked it a great deal. Not sure it would hold up against some of the real Belgian Strong Dark Ales it has been classed with, but a very good beer none-the-less."
"Drinkability is almost non existent. It takes time and commitment to get through one of these, and a six pack has taken me a couple of weeks. I'm putting one in the cellar to see what happens over a bit of time. Maybe the booze will mellow and allow the fruit to come forward, but I'm not optimistic."
"This is a tasty sour beer. not bad (at least this one time) but i wouldnt buy a sixer. more than acceptable for a beet beer if wacko was anything to judge by. tolerable"
"Overall, I wanted to love this beer. Probably because of the nostalgia of being one of my first craft beers. But while it isn't bad, and if I was at a bar and this was my only craft option I'd be OK with it, it isn't a mind blower."
"A little on the sweet side, but the ABV is well-masked and this one is an easy drinker."
"Overall, this is easily one of my favorite Dogfish brews aside from 90-minute IPA. Not quite sure why others aren't as impressed. Sure, DFH beers are usually hit or miss, but this one is quite tasty."
"Would be a good beer paired with some food and potentially as a good marinade. Not for any drinking session. This beer is very unique and I am impressed on its shining characteristics in each category."
"Drinkability- 4 out of 5. It's far from being a great Belgian beer, but it's definitely drinkable-- almost dangerously so, considering its 8% ABV. Its drinkability is its saving grace. If you find this on tap, and there's not much else in your taste/price range, I'd recommend it, but take it slow. This is the kind of beer that sneaks up on you at the end of the night, when you lurch off your bar stool to stumble to the bathroom and realize you suddenly have four feet."
"Drinkability & Final Thoughts: Meh. Certainly not a good example of a Belgian strong dark. The aroma was disconcerting and I am just not sure if I had a bad bottle or what. I'll probably give it another try at some point just to be fair, because I know Dogfish Head makes quality brews that I have rarely had issue with."
"Drink- An over-exaggerated Belgian? It's a decent sipper, but doesn't stand out among its peers."
"I won't be finishing this one - perhaps my neighbor will take the rest of the six off my hands."
"Overall. Ok, not gonna be one I search out. This was my first DFH beer."
"Drinkability: Another great DFH beer. Good, unique flavor and a nice take on the style. Very drinkable for what it is, I can see myself enjoying this brew again. Recommend."
"D - Good drinkability for the ABV. Definitely doesn't taste like it is 8%, as far as drinkability for the beer itself, it is too sweet to drink easily, might get again just because it is fairly cheap for the style."
"D- Despite the disappointment, the overall flavor and feel did not prevent me from dumping it out. The flavor grows on you, but it's not anything I would recommend or get again"
"Pours a redish brown. Aroma isn't too pleasant. Dominated by the scent of alcohol with a whiffs of chocolate and sweet candy as well. Low carbonation and medium body. Dark fruits start off the flavor profile. Plums, dates and a bit of raisins shine through. Not enough raisins to justify the name. Sweet chocolate creates an enjoyable finish. Alcohol is a little strong and unpleasant for an 8% ABV, really shines through as the beer warms. I actually prefer this one colder than suggested."
"Pours into a imperial pint ruby red with a thin off white head. Minimal lacing. The smell shows the Raisens, grapefruit scents with a belgian yeast scent. The taste is much the same. Maybe a little too strong with the grape/raisens. There is a good amount of carmeled malt flavors as well."
"D- This is an enjoyable and drinkable beer. This is not a bad example of a Belgian Strong Dark Ale, but no where near the best. The reason I like this beer is the fact that it is a cheap Belgian, $8.99 a six pack compared to $13.49 for a 750mL bottle of Chimay, and the only thing it is missing is the complexity."
"I think the alcoholic kick at the conclusion can occasionally numb the tongue to the flavor and this palette scrape gets worse as the beer warms. The dryness and sweetness are both a bit cumbersome and some balance could be attained through aging. It's too sweet for multiple samplings, but it's decent enough to warrant a go-round."
"I can't say this brew is bad, but as a Dogfish drinker I don't believe I'll be purchasing another sixpack after this one's finished. Give it a chance if your curious, as this taste is different. Different is not always good, but this one is worth a try."
"Okay but not great. Decent beer for dubbel or quad fans but might also turn them off with the bitterness factor. Too strong to drink a lot of. Glad I had it and enjoyed it, but probably won't be back."
"I had high expectations given other DFH beers I've had. labeled a Belgian Strong Dark and ""brewed with Belgian candi sugars and raisins"" I thought this should be a good one. Very disappointed that I put back a Saison DuPont to buy a pack of this."
"Drinkability: I'm still pissed at myself that I have to drink five more of these. So disappointing. I'll choke them down, but only because of economics."
"Finishes dry but too sweet for me."
"Drinkability: This is ok, but I am really surprised at how poorly it is tied together. There are beers that completely dominate this one in every way. The best way I can describe this is clunky."
"could pound these beers but with the high alcohol i might kill myself"
"This tastes really great slightly raisony a little toffee and other dark notes. I'm a fan of darker beers and this is a perfect medium, i could drink this stuff all night. This is my favorite dogfish head beer i've had out of 4 or 5, the problems with most of their beers is they are much too hoppy for me, the finish is usually bitter and is slightly too carbonated. But they really did a great job with this beer good job dogfish head."
"If I'm going to drink something from DFH, it's not going to be this and I glad I had a friend give me one rather than springing for a whole 6-pack."
"There's nothing wrong with this beer, it has some nice malts and is entirely inoffensive. But (at the risk of singling it out), this is the poster child for a very pedestrian American beer that goes for a world class category and gets a gentlemanly ""C."" I wouldn't order this as an everyday beer, I wouldn't pick it (like a Duvel or Chimay) for a special occasion. Not even close. So what's the point?"
"D- well for 9 abv is rather drinkable. Good stuff but in the big world of bsda its not one that shines."
"The taste on this is spice and sweetness. It almost reminds me of a sweet dopplebock, with the spice up front and a slight alcoholish fade."
"D - Wouldn't buy this again. I found myself not wanting any more after just one. If you liked it, you could probably drink a few though because it is lighter than most BSDAs."
"O Tastes a lot like Belgian darks that I have had, although sweeter. A complex brew that changes as it warms toward the end of the glass. Recommend."
"D: not something I'd quaff all night, but it drinks well for the weight. A characteristically American twist on the genre. Seek this one out."
"I'd say this bottle has held up rather well for the past four and a half years."
"I don't know where to begin with this beer. Pours a nice mahogony, with a keeper tan ring. A few carbonation trailers, and that's it. The aroma starts off as an amaretto, with perfumy highlights. First taste is like a bitter porter and feels the same. Afterward, two flavors hit a wall: a bitter green leafiness (or unripe coffee bean), and a sharp, metallic sweetness. The finish is alcoholic, sticky, and lingers, but ultimately feels way too flat. A truly odd experience. Very complex, I enjoyed sampling one, but it's just too much outside of the good beers it reminds me of."
"D- i got through half of it pretty quick and then the alcohol hit me. It is a nice sipper. Smooth and great."
"Mouthfeel and drinkability are OK. I don't think I would enjoy this as much by itself. However, this was a perfect compliment to peanut sauce and curry."
"A beer one would only need one of to enjoy. Not anything I would pound out with the buddys or anything."
"I like it alot. I am sorry I only had a single 12oz. I could have easily had another. 2 thumbs up to Dogfish for this one."
"Taste is sweet with alcohol overtones followed by an astringent bite.fairly thin bodied, the alcohol certainly pokes through. Not supremely drinkable but an interesting beer to say the least."
"Smell was very interesting; very similar to an Irish Red, but with a hint of something cold and quiet behind it all. The flavor itself mimics the smell, not overpowering, but present and unique. Pleasantly made a path down to the stomach, leaving a nice glow behind. I can't really taste the raisins, but it's more of a feel of raisins than an actual flavor."
"This beer pours a nice deep amber color. The aroma is sweet and contains a nice head. The flavor is a little complex with it tasting rather sweet throughout and the raisins coming in nicely in the end. Another fine brew from the Dogfish Head Brewery."
"Overall, an enjoyable draught from DFH. I couldn't see myself drinking more than one or two of these in a stretch, but as an occasional treat, most definitely. I saved two of these from my sixer to age and try later."
"D-I very much like this beer. It is extremely well balanced, notwithstanding the unimpressive nose. I wonder about the consistancy, though, as reviews of this are all over the board. Barleywineish? Hoppy? Not at all...just a smooth creamy DFH take on Belgian goodness."
"Drinkability - Very easy to drink dark ale with alcohol that is hard to detect. Dogfish describes this beer as a ""Belgian-style brown ale brewed with beet sugar, raisins, and Belgian-style yeast."" I'd have to say they hit their mark. Malt heavy brown ale with roasted flavors that mix really well with the caramel/toffee/dark fruits sweetness. Dry feel pulls it all together. Definitely recommend checking it out."
"This is a god seasonable beer. I would recommend it at fall or early spring."
"D-eh kind of a disappointing brew from DFH; nothing about it really wowed me, i hate raisins so the idea of brewing beer with it turns me off. at no time when i was drinking this did I think of a Belgian dark ale, they didn't conform to the typical characteristics and got too far off the path with this one"
"Mouthfeel is medium and drinkability is good. Not really my type of beer, but for the style, its definitely one of the better ones."
"D: A decent beer but not top on my list for Belgian SDA's. Poured it at room temperature but the complexity didn't develop over the life of the glass. Left something to be desired..."
"The beer seems to get much better as it warms, the alcohol seems to mellow a bit and the off putting raisin/prune seem to meld with the rest of the flavors. Unfortunately they don't meld enough to save this beer for me. I really wanted to like this beer, but it didn't quite get there for me."
"D: Very smooth and easy for 8%, has good flavor...another solid brew from the great Dogfish Head."
"Not as good as the D'Extra, but I always had to go out of state for that one due to Ohio's cap, and now, alas, it's on hiatus, so this will have to do."
"D - This is a good beer - different and interesting with a somewhat complex palate. I would buy this again but I won't seek it out."
"D: In my opinion this is not a very sessionable beer, but enjoyable non the less. I am a huge fan of Dogfish and what they bring to my glass, another solid offering from one of my favorite brewers."
"An easily drinkable beer reminds me of sweet dark germans, but not a whole lot of character on its own. I would drink it again if it was free but I won't seek it out again."
"D: Sam says he made this beer to answer the question ""What beer would go best with a wood-grilled steak", and I'd have to agree. But enough flavor to have on it's own and not high enough in alcohol to prevent a second glass. One of my favorite go-to beers."
"Drinkability: this is a decent beer. Probably not the best BSDA, but tasty none the less. think the people upset with this beer just hold DFH to a higher standard and understandably, couldn't help being upset. I would get it again, not in a rush, but I would."
"D: Solid. A little sweet and a little strong too have more than one, but I definitely enjoyed it. Word on the street is that it's being discontinued, so I urge you to grab some while you can!"
"Overall, a well rounded beer, but the aroma is what really shines through. this beer would be wonderful with desert or as a spring afternoon refreshment."
"D - if it was at a party I would drink it, nut I would not buy it again."
"I still enjoy this brew, but it's not as good as I remembered it. Now I find myself wishing I had just bought 90 min IPA instead."
"Pleasant mouthfeel, but a little too carbonated it seems. Overall a decent beer but comes across as being a bit to sweet for me."
"This is a great beer. 8% abv, but it drinks very easily. It has a very unique flavor, and as an earlier person noted, the taste is that of a dark fruit. You can definitely taste the green raisins and beet sugars, but it's rounded off nicely with a bit of astringency. It gets more drinkable as it warms, and although the smell isn't phenomenal it is certainly not bad. I would recommend this if you are looking for something unique. I have a feeling that I could drink a six pack of these in one night, which is foreboding in the best way."
"Nice warmth, medium body. Pretty good, but feels like lost potential."
"D - Man this is weird but I think this is the first dogfish head I actually liked! I had the 90 back in the day and may have it again because it was undrinkable and the peach flavor sour was a drain pour. Really solid beer and was impressed."
"D: This is a good beer to sip but I can't see having more than one of these in one session. The alcohol starts hitting you after a while."
"Drinkability- Ok I suppose. It has the Belgian essence but it just feels off. It's not a bad beer but I feel like it's missing something. Dogfish Head seems to throw caution to the wind as their modus opperandi. While this can sometimes be rewarding, it also causes them to occasionally miss the mark."
"An interesting beer to say the least. I'm glad I tried it, but I don't think I'll be running out to restock any time soon."
"D- not really my cup of tea. The raisins do keep it interesting. I think one to two is enough in a sitting because of the alcohol. If you are seeking DFH brews... I would stay with their other offerings."
"I am not normally a Dogfish Head fan, but this is pretty good. Pours a rich coppery brown with a decent head. The aroma is malty and sweetish with some dark fruit and woodiness. The flavor is sweet, a bit earthy, and malty. There is some beet-like sweetness (yeah, I know the beet sugar doesn't impart flavor, but there is a beety quality anyway), a slight phenolic edge, and a carmelly finish. The mouthfeel is relatively thin and flat."
"Every once and awhile, you do need to have something to challenge your senses."
"This is a smooth and enjoyable dark ale. I grabbed a second one immediately."
"I am usually a fan of all things Dogfish, but this particular brew just didn't do it for me. I'm not saying it wasn't artfully brewed or put together carefully. To me personally, the taste is what killed it, or to be more precise, the flavor. It is not too strong or overbearing, just unpleasant to my palate. Oh well, I got 4 90 min IPAs in the fridge to help me forget about the gross aftertaste of the Raison D'Etre. Thanks Dogfish! For the 90 min IPA that is..."
"I can't see ever drinking this with dinner. I would say enjoy on its own or with some strong flavored cheese perhaps. This is an interesting and rather unique beer that not everyone will love."
"D: Eh, most BSDA's aren't highly drinkable, but this beer doesn't make you want to have another. I'll be sure to make my way through this six pack over time and probably won't be revisiting it."
"D: No thanks, I will not have another (and I only had half of one). The copper astringency is just too much for my palate to handle. Maybe aging would help this, but I will look elsewhere for examples of this style. I will say this: If the taste had lived up to the smell, I would have given this much higher marks."
"A brown-amber color. Very clear. Poured a small head that went away quickly. Faded into a film at the third sip. Smells of roasted malt, coffee, and alcohol. I'm getting a sort of dry mouthfeel. I struggle to put the taste into words. The wife says ""burnt toffee"". Maybe she's right. The bitterness is pretty high. This beer was middle of the road for me. I'd probably look to grab something else before going with this beer again."
"The color is a burnt amber with little head retention and light carbonation. It smells sweet and alcoholish as my friend has so elegantly described. The mouthfeel is flirting with a light creamy texture , combined with malty sweetness and an underlining hint of alcohol warmth. The overall taste of the beer was complex, but very easy to drink."
"I wouldn't have to be desperate to reach for this, but it wouldn't be a first choice. It's okay, but not great."
"Mouth is exceptionally smooth, a soft medium body that just goes down real easy. The taste is a little sugary. subtle hints of raisin. and maybe dates or other dark fruits. Belgian sugars and definite maltiness in the finish. Overall this is a fairly balanced, yet not overly enjoyable drink. Just a nice easy to drink starter-Belgian strong dark ale."
"Overall, this is a pretty decent brew from Dogfish Head. Decent flavor and body, but the beer leaves you wanting something more, especially when you consider some of the other Dogfish Head brews like World Wide Stout and Burton Baton. I probably won't be picking this up again, but if you haven't tried it, its worth checking out."
"D - The finish is sweet with little to no aftertaste."
"This knocks off Delirium Noel as the least favorite of the BSDAs that I've sampled this season, but I still enjoyed it in the end. It's way better than Guiness Draught in a can."
"D: I didn't find myself wanting more once I finished it. I enjoyed the sweetness, but felt it was missing a nice balance the whole way through."
"Poured from the 12 fl. oz. bottle on March 9, 2010. The color is an attractive mahogany amber with about three-quarters of an inch of beige=, foamy head. It never quite goes away. The aroma is a pleasing enough mixture of raisins, malts, and yeast but I also get a bit of alcohol.The taste is bitter and sweet with a thin but noted dry hoppy ending. Not a bad beer altogether except for that bit of alcohol scent."
"Light brown pour with a quickly disappearing head. Aroma is toffee and nuts with a hint of spice. Flavor is lightly toasted nuttiness with even lighter notes of toffee sweetness and nutmeg. Mouthfeel is medium bodied. Drinkability is low simply because the flavor profile is very weak and doesn't justify the lofty 8% ABV tag. This was tasty, but unmemorable."
"Smell is faint and complex, hard to dissect. Dark fruity sweetness, well-rounded malts, slight berry or stone fruit esters. First impression on sipping it is the massive mouthfeel - hugely thick, sugary slickness. The sweetness lingers throughout and is backed up by a strong second-string malty presence. Flavors take a back seat and are hard to discern on this palate of mouthfeel, but I'd summarize it as raisins, grapefruit, hint of pineapple, oats, maltishness?"
"It had a dark amber color with a decent head, very inviting. Aroma of figs, brown sugar, and a faint citrus undertone. Taste was hard to pin down: it seemed a bit muddled with perhaps too much going on and nothing clear. Follows the nose and is quite sugary, with very mild hop presence. Similar to an abbey ale in some ways. Feel was smooth and rich and the beer is drinkable, but I wouldn't have more than a couple."
"Overall - A pretty average Belgian dark ale but probably worth a try.."
"D= 3.5 Interesting beer with a surprisingly light body. I like the combination of the tartness from the green raisons matched with Belgian beet sweetness. It was a neat brew and surely a different style. I enjoy it"
"A pleasant cold-weather brew."
"Dogfish Head Raison D'etre pored a dark amber color, with a bit of a smaller head. It had a flavorfull smell to it. It had a heavier taste with many differnt strong flavors, while it was bitter and hoppy there was also a bit of a sweetness as well. It was heavier and had a plesent aftertaste, and it wasnt hard to drink at all. Overall its not the best Dogfish head, but its still a very good beer worth a try, and its one of the cheaper Dogfish Head beers out there."
"D - definitely drinkable just slightly underwhelming overall"
"I will try other Dogfish Head beers in the future!"
"i recommend anyone try this. give it time. and focus. not just another brew to slog down and dis...as a hophead, this is far from my favorite style. but it is brews like this that got me back to appreciating (once again) other styles."
"I like this beer and will buy it again!"
"D: For me, this beer does alot of things right and a few things wrong. It's full bodied, bold flavored, but misses the mark on a Belgian Strong Dark Ale. Enjoyable, but not my favorite offering from Dogfish head."
"Overall, not a fan of this offering. The syrupy sweetness makes it tough to have more than one for sure and I didn't find it balanced or interesting enough to make it a favored sipper. Will stick with other DFH products and file this one away under ""noble experiment gone awry""."
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a pretty dark amber color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is very mild, some notes of fruit. Taste is good, fruits, malts, a touch of alcohol. Feels full bodied in the mouth and has average drinkability. Overall this is a good quality beer."
"D: not as good as most beers in this category, this being my top style it was rather disappointing. it drinks like it is at least 10% abv; 8% abv is on the low end of the spectrum for the category and the booze should be undetectable at this level. I am going to lay one of these down for some time and see if it improves ( probably not but its worth a try). dogfish head seems to never let me down and they did on this one. I would not buy again unless miracles happen with age."
"Drinks pretty smoothly-a solid version of a Belgian Strong Dark."
"Apperance 3.0, Smell 3.5, Taste 3.5, Feel 3.5, Drink 3.5, Score 3.4"
"D: Not great, but not bad."
"-Cheers!"
"All in all, this is a decent brew to try once. Not one of the best from DFH. I'd recommend trying Santo Marron if you want to try a good DFH brew. Only try this if you've had some good brews from DFH. Not more than 1 try is necessary."
"+ a nice complex love triangle between the fruits, the caramel, and the roasted malt make this beer worth drinking. i've never been a big fan of belgian dark beers, but i think Raison D'Etre may have changed my mind."
"Of all the year-round beers from Dogfish Head, I think this is probably my least favorite. Not a bad beer by any means, this is definetly worth checking out, especially if you like Belgian Ales and raisins."
"No complaints about the mouthfeel, but I can't see throwing these back. It's hard for me to define 'drinkability' with a beer like this, but it doesn't make me excited to dirnk another, I'd rather move on to something different, so I can't give it too high of a score."
"Pours a deep crimson with a strong head of khaki that stood for several minutes (without starch, no less!) before settling away into the bloody sea. The waves smell rollingly of raisins, dark malts, and figs, each progressively smashing the olfactory rocks throughout the sniff. The figgy waves, though, are the ones that hit the hardest once the tasting begins, the malts and raisins rowing ashore bedecked in full ninja regalia. This covert crew and their more ostentatious front-line compatriots sit somewhat heavily on the tongue, almost languishing there, but are saved by the grace of a very smooth texture, keeping them from malingering in Limbo with Virgil and his cohorts, but not raising them too far up the purgatorial mountain."
"Overall, this is a really good beer, and the ABV is masked really well, It doesn't really strike me as a BDSA, but it is still a really good beer."
"Poured this dark ruby brown beer into a pint glass. The head that was poured into the pint glass was a good half an inch of head. It then reduced down to faint wisps of lacing. The aroma of smell that wafts from this beer is that of a malt and raisin. The taste follows suit in the taste but follows a sweeter taste of raison. Yet there is also a hint of plum taste as well. Overall a great beer by the brewers of Dogfish Head."
"Not bad, but by far from the best."
"This is a classic not good, not bad beer. I seem to remember enjoying it more two or three years ago; looks like my palate has changed."
"Pours a cloudy shade of maroon with about a one finger head. Retention is decent, but not great. It smells earthy. There are notes of dark fruit, molasses, and spices. Malt and dark fruit taste. It becomes more complex with 6 months of aging. It's medium bodied, with medium to low carbonation. The mouthfeel is not great, a little oily. It's not the most drinkable beer out there, and I would stick to no more than 2 or so a night."
"Pours a golden brown color with great clarity. No real head to it, there was a slight white head that went away fairly quickly and less than average lacing, but looked better than average for this style of beer. The smell is a little unique, very sweet smelling, much like sweet roasted malts. A slight smell of hop, but clearly a malt dominated beer. The taste is very similar to the smell. Sweet roasted malts, toffee, caramel, brown sugar and a bit of a buttery taste. Much like the smell, there isn't much of a hop taste to it, dominated by the malts agian. The mouthfeel is good. Pretty smooth, nothing bitter about it due to the lack of hoppy flavor. I think this is a pretty drinkable beer, I was finished with it before I really knew it. I'm generally not a huge fan of this style, but I'd certainly drink it again if I were in the mood."
"Notes: I went into this review, with the Raison D'Êtra being one of my favorite beers from one of my favorite breweries (was not a fan of the Festina Peche). One of the best part about starting the blog is the chance to re-evaluate all the beers I have already enjoyed. This beer has been compared to the complexity of red wines, and could be paired with similar styles of food. This beer is great with grilled red meats, and beef stew."
"Overall this beer has greatly improved with several years of age on it and it was a nice treat on cold winter night. I would suggest to throw a couple of these in the cellar and see how they develop. Recommended."
"Buy Again? Yes, if I’m in the mood."
"D- I can't drink more then a few of these but the first few are very drinkable."
"M, D- Too monotonous for inspired consumption, much less repeat again, the lack of interest was a surprise with this one."
"This really reminds me more of a Samuel Smith with a little more kick."
"Overall, very drinkable. Outstanding for the style. Quite impressive."
"Not the best beer I have ever had. Its a sweet malty tasting beer. I really did not get the raisin taste but the sweetness masks the 8% level of alcohol. Easy to drink and good with some sweet bread or treats. I don't know if I will rush to get it again but it was worth the 2.50 I paid for it."
"This is an excellent beer, It reminded me of a rum soaked holiday cake. I know it's not for everyone, but I would definitely recommend at least picking up a single bottle if you can. Enjoy!"
"This one is kind of weird for me. Kind of hot going down and in my stomach. I normally really like DFH too. I have five more, so I hope there's time for it to grow for me. But right now it's not too much of a pleasure to drink. Will probably revisit later."
"Not a desireable taste left, and a struggle to keep drinking it to the end. Try this one with friends, that way you don't end up drinking all 12 oz. by yourself."
"D: above average drinkability for an 8%, but it'd be much better if the flavors matched up together better. Not a bad brew -- it's just nothing special, and I've come to expect great things from DFH."
"It's perfect with my vegetable-mushroom stir-fry with peanut sauce. It harmonizes perfectly with the toasted sesame oil. It would likewise be a winner with lots of desserts: English gingerbread, creme brulee, or praline ice cream."
"This was an extremely easy to drink beer for an 8% abv beer, one I might order again to give it another try, but one that I wasn't super excited about drinking."
"Drinkability: Pretty good high abv session beer. Really flavorful and easy to go down. High abv limits a lot of these though."
"It says 'mahogany' on the label, and that is the color that it pours, and relatively clear. The head is small, although the foam is of a good, natural quality. The taste is mostly malty, definitely sweet but not overly so in my opinion, thanks to a minimal amount of hoppiness. The raisin flavor is subtle; I don't think I would have detected it without the label. This beer is quite drinkable, enough so that at 8% you better be careful."
"[Overall] - Avoid this one. Dogfish stikes again with another overrated, if not, outright bad beer. A Belgain inspired beer that is out of balance."
"Seems to be the perfect choice to help warm me up on this 20 degree New York night."
"You can taste the alcohol in this one though, that adds to the taste for me. If you like dark blegian beers, this is up your alley, just not for me, though it is drinkable."
"Pours a medium copper color with no head at all and no lacing. The aroma is of molasses and some raisins with a hint of sweet malt. The taste is of a big caramel backbone with some raisins and a slight sweetness as well. The mouthfeel is syrupy and moderately carbonated. The drinkability is okay one is good two would be okay any more and I dont know. The taste was dominated by caramel to much for this class for me."
"Dr. One will do for me. Definitely a sippy beer."
"(D)- An interesting beer with some good things going for it. My only complaint is how sweet it was. It should be better fresher."
"Raison D'etre is not a beer I could drink more than one or two in a row. It's is quite rich, but feels more sugary sweet than the average BSDA that I am used to, which brings out their character in malt complexity, rather than sweetness."
"Drinkability:Was another interesting Dogfish brew. Seems like a pumpkin brew with the pumpkin replaced by beet and a bit more sweetness than spice. I'd definitely enjoy this again given the chance just wouldn't go out of my way to."
"Drinkability- Surprisingly drinkable considering"
"This one poured a light amber hue with a minimal head that faded fairly quickly. The aroma of alcohol dominated the olfactory passageways and was followed by brown sugar, fruits, and a slight hop aroma. Upon first taste, it was sweet and sugary with a strong malty backbone that intermingled with the high alcohol content very nicely. Slight hints of plums and red grapes made their way into my senses as well. The mouthfeel was balanced well with carbonation and wasn't too thin despite the alcohol present in this one. Overall, it was a tad too sweet, though the underlying flavors were an enjoyment for sure."
"D: A bit of a wild one, Rasion D'Etre is labeled as a Belgian strong dark ale but it's more of a hybrid belgian dark ale/barleywine, IMHO. It's kind of all over the place with it's tastes and the pronounced alcohol. Veteran beer drinkers don't normally want the alcohol to be so upfront on certain kinds of beers. When a brewer is able to hide the ABV, the better the brew is, on most occasions."
"Overall - Less complex than the Belgian (and some of the other American) examples of this style, but still a pretty good beer, and very reasonably priced for what it is. Worth trying. Malt fans will enjoy it."
"A brownish mahogany color that pours a small head and doesnt leave much lacing. The smell is pretty sweet, there's a lot of flavor going on in this beer and they kindof mesh together. However, in the smell i mostly get caramel, raison, and maybe brown sugar? The taste is pretty sweet as well. It is dominated by malt and i cant sense much hops. It tastes pretty much like the smell but i also taste slight alcohol as its going down. Overall, this is a very unique beer and a very good one. One of my favorites from Dogfish."
"Overall Impressions: Flavor is similar to aroma, though not as full. Better as it warms closer to room temperature. Nice slow-drinking beer."
"Drinkability is average. I could enjoy one of these but not something I want to have much more of."
"D - DFH makes beers that you usually love or hate. This one is different for me as I see it as middle of the road. However, it is goof enough that I would like to drink more than one."
"Overall, this is not my favorite from Dogfish Head by far, but it's definitely a really nice, interesting beer to warm you during the chilly winter months. I can imagine drinking this along side a stew, hearty soup, or a rich meal like mac/cheese or even a nice burger or meatloaf!"
"Notes: Still nice, but loses a bit of touch on a glass like this, and maybe a tad to cold to make it justice but the supposed tap freshness does not make me forget its bottled version."
"I have to assume I got a bad bottle? If not, then reviews I have read are extremely far off."
"Taste is very rich & smooth with a really nice malt profile with some nice raison hints with light belgian sugars. A light hoppiness that almost evens it out t's a very awesome and drinkable for 8%."
"D: This is a beer that demands you take it slowly and patiently due to its up-front flavors and high alcohol content, but when done so, this is a real treat. While not as ""great"" as I remember, this is a fun and playful beer from a playful company. It's worth your tastebuds."
"Serving type: bottle"
"Jordan."
"I don't really know what to say about this beer. It's the damnedest thing - no aroma to speak of, with a fairly mediocre taste and down right unpleasant aftertaste. Will not be trying again."
"overall I like this beer it's really different, but not in a bad way. And on top of it all it has a higher abv, so fewer to drink to get a nice buzz going, and that's all I can really ask for."
"D: Once again, a very interesting beer from DFH. Something that would probably be great paired with certain foods, but not something I would probably want more than one at a time."
"This dark ale was amber with no head. The aroma was malt city and sweet to boot! On the palate, there was loads of sweet malt as well as dark raisins, currants, unsulphered molasses and dark corn sirup. Think I'd like to get a bottle of this an sit on it a while, then see how it tastes. Nice!"
"Poured from bottle into sam adams glass, deep red color, light head that dissipated quickly, I found the flavor to be very complex and layered with a nice well rounded mouth feel. A good beer but not something you'd want to drink a lot of in a row, well you could but ..."
"I was pleasantly surprised at this one. Pours a nice, tight white head, leaving some tracing down the glass. Scents of raisin, nuts, cherries, and candi sugar on the nose. A bit sweet, very plummy, nothing offensive. Washes down with a smooth exit, a faint touch of hops and extremely fruity. This one was well worth it and less expensive than other Belgian Strongs."
"I didn't care for this beer, and I like most of what DFH makes. I only drank about 6 oz before pouring the rest out. I'd say this is the first beer where I really tasted the alcohol, and it wasn't the warm, sweet kind, it was the medicine cabinet type. The appearance was fine, a nice dark brown. Aromas had a little zing, almost tangy, I was thinking this might be a bit sour. Then the taste, initally sugary sweet that turned just gross. Pass on this one."
"- Very drinkable... but sweet. I am surprised this got bottled, but I give them credit at the same time for doing so! Strange eh?"
"I am now very curious about this style and to read the other reviews."
"D- It is a good beer to be had if you're in to trying new ones. Every brew deserves a try. It didn't do it for me though. It wasn't bad...just not a real great brew. For me it's like cooked carrots. If you serve then to me, I will eat them and say thank you...I'll never eat them otherwise. The same hold for the Dogfish Head Raison."
"D-It is a good beer to be had in rotation with other beers of it's style....and the 8% abv. makes this a nice slow sipper."
"The feel of this beer is light. It is not very carbonated but feels that way with the slight aftertaste. This is pretty drinkable with a nice body as well."
"This is a reasonably drinkable beer, but not necessarily my favorite from Dogfish Head. If you're a fan of their beers or raisins, however, this is definitely worth checking out."
"Drinkability: Not bad overall, I would drink it again, but I don't think I'd go out of my way to pick up another bottle. If it was on tap though, I'd be excited to give it a shot."
"This beer is great with a peanut butter sandwich."
"Raison D'Être pours with two finger worth of head that stays around for a minute or two, long enough to enjoy but not too long as to get in the way. As you drink, several layers of lacing form, which equals cool. The smell on this one is currently faint, I blame it on the cold, but the smell (as I remember and can pick up) is peculiar. There's some definite sweet characteristics to it, brown sugar, a little bit of fruits - presumably the raisons - and possibly the last hard to identify smell is the freaking beets! I have to remember this was made with beet sugars, I love Dogfish Head. The taste is fully backed up by the smell! I hate it when I become fully enamored with the smell of a beer and the taste doesn't follow suit, fortunately that's not a problem with this beer. In the taste you get the malts, the raisons, the sweetness and some sort of other added spices. All of it works beautifully together and it's a freaking joy to drink. If you see this in your local beer stores selection and you haven't tried it yet, please do yourself the favor of purchasing this beer. It'll rock you from the pour to the final drink."
"Overall a great ale - however its classified."
"Mouthfeel is medium+ body & carbonation."
"Pours a dark brown with little head and a tiny bit of lace. Smell is sweet, caramel, and of course the hint of raisen. Taste matches perfectly. Very rich and full flavored. The raisen taste is very nice, but this has a great malty fullness. Not overly carbonated, but it doesn't need to be. Very well rounded and very enjoyable."
"Raison D'etre does not have the strong raison taste I feared. It's really nothing more than a complex, sweet, slightly fruity brown ale with a ton of character. It was very tasty."
"Pours a clear, dark amber color. 1/2 inch head of an off-white color. Good retention and slight lacing. Smells of sweet malt, grain, wood, slight hop, some vanilla, yeast, and slight citrus. Fits the style of a Belgian Strong Dark Ale. Mouth feel is smooth and crisp with an average carbonation level. Tastes of smoke, roasted malt, sweet malt, yeast, slight alcohol, slight hop, and some dark sweet citrus. Overall, a good body, complexity, blend, aroma, and mouth feel."
"Attractive reddish-brown color with minimal head. Mild, fruity aroma. It had an off-putting metallic taste on the first sip, but it dissipated quickly. It's a bit chewy. I taste raisins and brown sugar. Pleasant finish. Anyone wanting a ""Belgian beer"" should go elsewhere. But not a bad American craft brew."
"I was not impressed the first time I had this beer. However, as I worked through my six-pack, I discovered that this beer needs to warm quite a bit to experience the complex flavors. I may have this again as it is quite unique for the price."
"Pours a reddish brown color with a large tan foamy head which leaves a nice lace on the glass. The aroma and taste are of brown sugar and fruit. Has a sweet flavor as expected. This is a full bodied beer with good carbonation. The drinkability is good. I have not been disappointed with anything from Dogfish Head yet."
"D- Not a bad beer overall just not balanced enough to enjoy more than one."
"D - Heavy, sticky, sweet. I'm glad I tried it, but I doubt I'll buy this one again."
"D: I can't put my finger on the exact taste, but something about the lingering aftertaste of this beer is not to my liking. I don't think I'd have another."
"If I wasn't taking style into account or had never had a Belgian--I've had better at the same price point--I'd have given it a 4.5 in taste and 4.0 in mouthfeel. This does not have to be tweaked much to make it an exceptional BSD and I would definitely buy it again."
"Overall, I'm glad I gave this one a second try and its fair shake. I think its interesting to revisit certain beers and see how your perception of them have changed over time. This beer went from being utterly undrinkable to being somewhat decent, albeit not exceptional."
"Overall: This is no Chimay blue, but it is a nice stab at the style. I am going to age the rest of my six pack to see if this beer melds together a bit."
"Drinkability - 3.5/5.0 - very good beer, but maybe not what I would spend 10 bucks on regularally"
"My favorite that I've had from Dogfish Head so far. It almost has a taste of tea and beer mixed together. Kind of like a spice and fruit. When I drank this from the bottle I had an almost smokey aftertaste. Drinking it from tap at the Dogfish Head brewery restaurant, was served a beer at the perfect temperature. Which made it very easy to taste all the wonderful flavors of this beer. Had barley any head at all, but that's what I like. Goes well with spicy foods. Just be VERY careful. Don't forget it's a 8% ABV. You can't knock them down like regular beers. But you can't taste the extra ABV so again, be cautious."
"Needs a little boost in the flavor department, but still an okay beer. Lacking for the style though and there are better choices at similar or cheaper price points. I'll pass again on this one."
"Overall I do like this beer. It almost reminds me of a really light barleywine. It is missing a few characteristics that keep it from being really outstanding however. A little more flavor and complexity would do this beer wonders. I still have to say that I sometimes crave this beer because it reminds me of a barleywine but its much easier to drink when I'm not in the mood for something so powerful."
"Average mouthfeel, not too thick or syrupy and somewhat drinkable. Definately not the best Dogfish brew, and one of the least exciting Belgian Ales I've had..."
"Taste: Perhaps a little too sweet. The dark savory sweetness reminds me of a porter. I really like it, but a little bottle conditioning would have made it a bit better and added some complexity, in my opinion."
"Poured out of a growler into a chalice. Not much of a head on top, dark but clear body. Rather unusual smell, kind of smoky. Not at all a fan of the taste, syrupy and smoky, reasonable mouthfeel but an otherwise unenjoyable drinking experience. I found myself trying to down it before it got warmer, as I could tell that the unpleasant flavors were getting stronger as the glass warmed up, yet at the same time I wasn't inclined to finish the beer at all. I'm very open minded with beer and have rarely found a craft beer that I legitimately didn't want to finish, but this had to be as close as I've come. I wound up letting my housemates finish the rest of the growler."
"Drinkability: Understated complexity makes this a nice easy drinker."
"Served on draft from the Dogfish head pub in Gaithersburg, MD. Beer is clear, dark red, thin fine head rests on top, low carbonation. Sweet odd flavor, almost some smoke in the aftertaste, there is a second aftertaste that is better than the frist. Almost no aroma, some sweetness. Flavor is weak. I'm not really impressed. Mouthfeel is fine, full beer. Not sure this is one of my favorites from DFH."
"Great mouthfeel. Full and nicely carbonated, with just a bit of balancing syrupyness. Fits the beer well."
"Drinkability: I'm a little disappointed with this beer, it's a little watery in my opinion. However, it is surprising that it has 8 abv, but the taste just doesn't do it for me..smells and looks nice though. It may be an decent compliment to something bitter-sweet. Cheers."
"Overall: Not my favorite from DFH nor does it seem that it's really fitting in their lineup of brews. Not very complex nor would I seek it again but it was a decent 'once around'."
"D: This is where this beer falls short, It is much better when it is cold and as it warms it gets sweeter, too sweet in my opinion, after one, I'm moving on to something else, but I will come back someday!"
"Out of a 12 ounce bottle and into my basic snifter glass. The ale appears a clear medium chestnut color with about two inches of light ecru foam. The head lingers for a bit before settling to a thin layer. Aromas and flavors are of brown sugar, caramel, alcohol, nuts, mild hints of dried dark raisins, sweet malt. Maybe a notch better than medium bodied with ample carbonation for the style. Worth trying if you spot it."
"I'm starting a week of DFH - this is beer #1 in my custom mix sixer. Poured a clear, brilliant copper color with just a touch of head that faded quickly. Smells of roasted malt and molasses. The taste starts off bitter, but with a lot of body and then fades out into a nice, mellow, lingering finish roasted character. This beer definitely has a lot of body and some sweetness, but isn't sticky and it hides the alcohol very well. This is one I'll try again."
"Drinkability: while this beer is definitely not bad, it just doesn't happen to suit me too well. I'll enjoy this glass, but that will be it for me."
"D: Like I said, I cradled this one for a while. The sweetness was overwhelming in moments. I would suggest letting it warm substantially (30-45 minutes after taking it out of the cooler or fridge). I'm laying another of these bottles down for a couple of years to see how the fruits evolve."
"D - Quite a drinkable beer but not more than two at a time. I will definitely have again and recommend to others."
"Eh, I guess it's drinkable, but I'm just a little disappointed. The beer was a little underwhelming, but still good. I would like to give the beer another try, but I have other things higher on the list."
"mouthfeel is overly carbonated, but has a decent medium body. drinkability is damn near nil. i wouldn't buy it again, and i may drain pour this one, so as to be able to salvage my beer experience for the night."
"Pours, as it says, ""a deep mahogany"" with modest foam that hangs around with just the slightest lace. Aromas are very thick of molasses and some alcohol sweetness with no discernible hop characteristics. The feel is pretty slick and very coating with barely enough carbonation to balance the heavy syrupy body. Flavor is very chewy with lots of molasses, brown sugar, and the SLIGHTEST bit of raisin (though if you weren't looking for it, it could be pretty hard to find). The finish has a very modest bitterness that is not really from hop character, but mostly from a roasted barley character. Above all, however, the lasting finish is really a continuation of the wave of thick chewy flavors from earlier. I guess I don't particularly perceive this as very complex, just big really and I have a very difficult time categorizing this as a Belgian strong dark ale. It's really more like, Dogfish Head strong dark ale. Overall, it's not as balanced as I would I like and it seems a bit heavy handed. It's great in many ways, and is definitely worth a try, but it's by no means among my favorites of this style."
"Notes: probably the worst dogfish I've had, not very interesting and certainly nothing I'd buy again...Some good characteristics, but not well excecuted at all"
"D: could drink a few and would recommend to others"
"D: Masks the abv pretty well, would be a good party beer."
"I enjoyed this beverage very much and to date is one of my favorites from DFH (thought I havent had many). There isn't too much they could improve with this beer, in a good way. If you like a strong, dark ale thats on the untraditional side, I would defiantly recommend this."
"Yet another superbly crafted beer from Dogfish Head. This one isn't exactly exciting or anything, its just very well executed. If you like easy-drinking malt bombs, then this is a fine choice."
"D: At 8%, watch out. As you go it gets easier to drink, but foght the urge and drink slowly! Overall, a good beer."
"Overall: I'd rate it as a decent beer but not really representative of the style. If you come across it buy it, but I wouldn't seek it out."
"D- Drinkable, yes. Could I have several in a session... probably not... the sweetness would get to me and become too much. I would, however, readily reach for the D'etre when I'm in the mood for something sweet and reasonably priced..."
"carbonated mouthfeel, smooth and crisp. refreshing brew, overall very light. no astringency."
"D- ABV holds it back, but definitely an enjoyable and interesting brew."
"Notes: Taste reminds me of a Dopplebock."
"Not sure what to make of this brew. There's a lot going on in terms of tastes which on one sip I find delightful, and the next slightly off. Certainly not a traditional Belgian Strong Dark (as if DFH brews fall into categories). Certainly worth a try."
"This beer reminded me of their Indian Brown Ale. Pours a nice darker color with a decent foam head. Laced a little down the sides but nothing spectacular. To be honest I was also expecting a lot more raison taste to be present. I think it turned out a great brew that is out there and extreme but still well balanced enough for the craft brew drinking population."
"D: The abv and warming presence limits this to a nice, warmer, spicy drinking brew that can catch up rather quickly. Overall, another good offering from Dogfish Head..."
"Overall: There is something about Raison d'Etre that has always appealed to me. It was one of the first craft beers that made me think about an adjunct as something not inherently evil. It gets a few extra points for nostalgia and spirit from me (and my bias is noted here!)"
"This brew is a decent tasting brew. Nothing special - kind of an odd mix of flavors for me. It is a solid tasting brew. To be honest I was a bit disappointed. Would not seek it out again, certainly not for a full case."
"Regardless, the beer seems like a sessionable belgian which gives it a good mark by my standards."
"I personally enjoy the slightly sweeter, heavy, full bodied Belgian Ale so I would definitely have another as well as recommend it to others, however, it would not make my top 25 beers or even my top 10 of this style."
"D - yet another good brew from DFH. not my fave, but nothing to shake your finger at either. A solid American brewed Belgian Dark Ale, pleny of flavor. Solid"
"d-alcohol hidden well but comes out while finishing and lingers slightly."
"Pours a gorgeous crystal clear rosy brown color with a nice little tan head that laces with every sip. I caught some raisins and malt, yeast, bread and spices on the aroma. Taste is musty and malty. Mouthfeel is thick and drinkability is good as well."
"This beer pours a clear, dark ruddy brown colour, with minimal head, and no lacing. Quick out of the gate, I suppose. It smells of subtle roasted caramel malt, bittersweet chocolate, a little vinous essence, and a bit of bitter coffee. The taste is lightly roasted caramel malt, a tad chocolate candy-like, a bit of booze, dark fruit, and earthy hops. The carbonation is moderate, the body thick and viscous, with the booze well-integrated, and an off-dry sweet candy malt finish. This seems much more like a brown ale, a style I don't usually care for, but is also more of a ramped-up American version, and is thus quite tasty."
"Drinkability: Slow sipper, but not really the type of beer I want to sip all night long. Way too alcoholic, especially since it is only 8%. My first disappointment from DFH."
"This is a drinkable beer, but I'm not sure it's a Belgian Strong Dark. It has some of that style's qualities, but it also has some qualities of the American craft styles."
"Overall an okay if not stunning beer."
"drinkability- not bad, but maybe to sweet at times."
"Overall, this is a reasonable beer to drink. I don't believe I would want more than one in a sitting, but will certainly finish this and enjoy it while it lasts."
"NOTES: The beer is a rich, creamy, lightly carbonated 8% ABV beer that I have to say I think would be best as a desert beer. I am a big IPA, DIPA, DIIPA hop-bomb beer drinker, but I could easily take a couple of these down as an end to a meal. I think this would go particularly well after a steak or the like. Something hardy!"
"Drinkability: This beer is average for the style. While this is not a bad beer by any means, it lacks the complexity of other Belgian strongs or strong ales in general. I prefer the chimay or the unibroue offerings I've had. I'm a a fan of Belgian styles but this lacks a lot of complexity. Average at best for the style. For the money I'd step up to something different."
"Poured a hazy dark amber into a goblet, with a thin orange-tinted head that quickly receded to a thin cap and left little lacing. Aroma was dark fruits, bread, nuts, caramel, toffee. Mouthfeel was a little thick with medium carbonation which stayed throughout the good length of time I took to enjoy this brew. Taste was lots of chocolate, caramel, a bit of toasted nuts toward the finish, sweet, dark fruits, very warming. Drinkability is moderate due to the complexity of the brew. Overall I enjoyed this brew and would try it again. I have one left in the six pack and they never disappoint while watching a good movie."
"Had good intentions of liking...still trying. Appearance - Deep amber, nice frothy lingering head. Clear copper. Smell - burnt orange, cinnamon raisin toast w/ cream cheese. Taste - overly sweet, malty...candied tree bark. Styrofoam cup...stale hot chocolate. Mouthfeel - long, lingering, intense, interesting...I like the mouthfeel as is very dynamic and complex. Drinkability - to review but otherwise would never reorder or repurchase or recommend. Sorry DFH!"
"Drinkability is not great, but not bad. The ABV isn't too high so a couple could be in order. That being said, I wish that I had more than one."
"Pours a rich brown color with an average egg-shell colored head that settled into a sparse cap. The aroma is of light toasted malt and some brown sugar and vanilla. The taste is of toasted raisin bread, honey and brown sugar, a bit woody and hints of fruit. Seems to be an earthy hop presence in the end. The brew has a full body with fizzy carbonation, finishes sweet and slightly sticky. Another unique brew from DFH. Seems to be a Belgian inspired brown ale, not sure that it is a BSDA. Not much fruitiness, sugary sweet with a nice toasted malt."
"Pours mahogany with a head that lasts the first few sips. Rich raisin and buttered toffee aroma with some faint bubblegum. The flavor is almost exactly like my first attempt at homebrewing a brown ale: slight suggestions of over-ripe bananas that turn to bolder flavors of sweeter brown sugars, followed by alcoholic phenols and a roasted cocoa finish. Mouthfeel is nothing special, but I wouldn't want it any more or less carbonated. Nitro might be interesting though and might fix the quickly dissipating head and add to the general richness surrounding the beer (maybe too much). Overall impression is that there's a lot going on, but I found it pretty damn enjoyable. I do agree though that it seems way more like a light-bodied wee heavy (with all the complex flavors) rather than a belgian strong dark ale. This would pair great with thanksgiving desert or figgy pudding in the holidays, basically with anything rich and sweet."
"Well I've never been a fan of this one in the bottle - basically, it's one of those DFH experiments that just didn't quite work for me. Too many weird flavors. But I've realized that on-tap some of the DFH beers take on a totally different life, so I figured I'd give it a shot. Unfortunately, it still didn't really do it for me. Poured a deep dark brown color with a really weak head and no lacing to speak of. Aromas are those same meaty, chocolatey maltiness with some strange over-ripe fruit. Body was alright, but still. The beer's not a total mess (I mean, I'm talking relative to other DFHs, not to macro sludge), but it's just not my thing."
"The mouthfeel is full and fluffy. To style, this beer falls far short; however, as a beer in general, its not bad. I would recommend this for someone with a thing for malt forward beers with a slight Belgian quality."
"Not at all bad, but I expect more from DFH... They make some great stuff. Don't stop experimenting guys..."
"I said it's like soda and the mouthfeel is sugary sweet--it's good. That same quality--like soda--hurts drinkability. I know you're out there, but most of us don't like to chug multiple sodas."
"Drinkability - I could definitely knock back a few. It's not heavy enough to not have more than one. Might be able to be a session beer."
"A nice, unexciting but very quaffable belgian-style strong dark ale. Less head and lacing than I'd like, a funny (yet pleasing) mud-puddle brown colour to it. Taste is figgy, caramely, reminiscent of Trois Pistoles with all the KAPOW taken out (which is not necessarily a bad thing - I love that beer but it's sometimes a little in-your-face) - probably just a tad too subdued. Alcohol is present but adds to the taste rather than distracting from the experience. Low-carbonation, very more-ish. I'd pick up more of this anytime."
"I've got some moderate liking for this beer. The fruity sweetness makes for a great dessert beer. I've got to knock it a little bit for some miscues in the finish, but that didn't ruin the experience for me. I wouldn't turn down the opportunity to sip one of these again. It deserves a solid 'B'."
"A friend picked this up for me in Houston. Opened yesterday, poured a deep auburn color with little white head. Smelled toasty and alcoholic, with notes of coffee and tobacco. Tasted sweet, toffeelike, with roasted grain, and a burnt/smoky finish. Very smooth mouthfeel, almost perfect. Went down smooth, but not really a sessionable beer, can drink more though."
"Dark mahogany color, creamy head. Smell the raisins, brown sugar, molasses, definitely getting the alcohol too. Really sweet, too much so - raisins, caramel, burnt sugar, the alcohol is ever present. Mouthfeel was flat, carbonation not good at all. First DFH beer and none too impressed. Definitely unlike any quality Belgian beer I've ever had, in a bad way. Have some DFH 60 minute and a brown IPA waiting in the fridge, hoping for a better product from this brewery with those."
"This beer would be pretty drinkable, the alcohol is hidden well, the mouthfeel is very nice...but the taste and smell really just keep me from enjoying the experience as a whole. Odd, because I love the D'extra. I cannot complain at all though, it's their creativity that keeps me coming back."
"Why did this burn/tickle my tongue? Not at all distasteful, but sorta plain-jane. I thought it was bland on the nose and taste really seemed limited and narrow. No complex aromas no shifting flavors, just mild and... pleasant but weak. It was super tingle-ie and bubbly in the mouth. I love me some Dogfish Head,, but not this one."
"d- very little alcohol detected... this bee could definately get me in trouble"
"Appearance is dark amber, a small head, and with moderate carbonation. Looks excellent. Smell is of dark fruits, boozy alcohol, and malt. Taste is all malt, roasted, and slightly sweet. Mouthfeel is thick and smooth. Excellent. Drinkability is very high due to almost undetectable alcohol while drinking."
"On-tap at Woody's City Market served in a New Belgium tulip glass a crisp ruby red with a nice frothy khaki head that slowly diminishes to a thin layer and leaves decent great lacing. Aroma is a bit of dried fruit and slight spice. The taste is an interestingly complex blend of dried fruit, dark malt and a hint of spice with a hint of sourness and a touch of dryness. The beer is medium bodied with a refreshing dryness. I've had this one before and remember not liking it, but I guess my palate is much more developed since then."
"Certainly not an awful beer or even a bad one. I just expect more from Dogfish Head. I think that's the real issue here."
"D - probably my least favorite offering thus far from DFH; if you're looking for a ""belgian"" beer, this is the wrong place to go for it"
"I did enjoy the beer, and its also priced right. I would definitely recommend it and will probablly buy again."
"Carbonation is initially a bit much, but it seems to ease off a bit. Nice, but not something I can get in to."
"Bye!"
"D: The alcohol is very present in this beer. Sometimes it overpowers the other flavors that should be showcased. All in all though I enjoy the flavor and aromas of this beer."
"Pours a deep caramel that glows with a thin off-white head that dissipates quickly. The aroma has many earthy notes, maybe some brown sugar and some tart fruit? There is quite a bit going on in the aroma but I can't pin down all of the scents. The flavor upfront is dried fruits with some bitterness immediately. There is a moderate warming that tells you the alcohol is there. There is also some caramel and earthly hops in the flavor that become apparent as it warms up. Its a medium-heavy bodied beer that is a bit syrupy. Overall it really isn't terribly difficult to drink although I probably wouldn't seek it out again."
"D= not too great. I really don't find this beer to be good. Ill finish it but never think about buying it again for a very long time."
"Poured into chalice, dark copper in color with thick, creamy head. Good retention and lacing. Smell was of sugar, some dark fruit, and some alochol, a little sweet caramel too. Taste was somewhat muted with a sweet malt, sweet caramel, and some sweet dark fruit (raisin, grapes). Overall...sweet. Mouthfeel was medium with moderate carbonation. Overall a good beer but nothing really jumped out at me."
"D: Will I buy another? Maaaybe...but I'm not sure. It's a fine drinking experience, to be sure, but I have other Belgian-type ales I'd run to first. Still, it's very well done."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied and smooth with a biting carbonation."
" To be honest I think this a decent beer. I did not really enjoy it all that well. Was considering aging some to compare later but not really that enthused when fresh."
"Average drinkability might be generous. I did not dislike this beer, but it certainly takes a while to finish one."
"It is a very simple beer, but has its own layers of complexity to it. All in all a good balanced product from dogfish head"
"D. Not very complex or flavorful. I don't think this should be described as a BSDA."
"Medium body. Very smooth drinker. I'm not really that impressed."
"D- A very unique brew. One can either like the unique nature or hate it. I enjoyed the six pack I bought, but I'm hesitant to buy anymore soon."
"An interesting brew with some different flavors but nothing I really feel like going back for seconds for. Kind of a weird sweetness to the flavor. I guess thats the Belgian beet sugars and green raisins?? Whatdya expect. By the end of the beer the flavor was wearing on me and I had had enough."
"Sorry Dogfish Head, you disappoint."
"I found this to be a lovely session ale, a bit of fruit, a bit of Belgian farmhouse, but not so much a dark ale, as claimed. The pour was not so special, ruby-brown, leading to a solid color with little to no head or lace...a bit sad. A banana-chocolate aroma first was present, but soon a malty fruit one took over. The body was medium with smooth raisin-malts and a hint of lemon. A bit sweet, but with hints of red wine, the raisin taste settled more like rum along with biscuit. Not great, but good as a session."
" My only negative comment on this product would be the lacking head and there is no lacing to speak of."
"a solid beer that i would call a mood beer, good only when im in the mood for something a little bit different."
"D- rather easy"
"D: Not sessionable, but drinakable. Share the six-pack with two friends."
"D-I would start any night of semi-fancy drinking with a Raison D'etre or two."
"I really liked this beer. It's a red color with no head. Its very smooth and you can taste the mahogany and raisin. I feel like Ron Burgundy, my beer smells of rich mahogany. This is one of the best American ales I've had with a great balance of malt, hop, raisin and yes mahogany. Surpised it's rated so low. I think it's one of the more mild DFH offerings, but so what not everything is extreme"
"D: Pretty drinkable considering the funkiness of it. DFH does it again."
"It drinks crisp and lighter than the 8.0% ABV would lead you to believe. Pours nice from the bottle as well."
"Nothing Dogfish throws out there will be normal or expected. This beer is no different. The bottle says that it is a mahogany ale, and thats not far off. It might be a little lighter than mahogany, but its darker than amber ale. Smells and tastes of tons of roasted malts, some caramel, some molasses. If you think about it, you can pick out the raisins that are noted on the label. Not enough sweetness for me to compare this to a belgian dark, it seems closer to brown ale to me. It has a nice malty aftertaste. This is a good beer from an outstanding brewery, but its not something I am gonna keep around. I'll drink it again, I'm sure, but not regularly."
"Mouthfeel is a solid medium body"
"Drinkability: Rich, definitely a sipper. Not a beer I'd crave personally, but an interesting and creative take on the style. I'd recommend it for a tasting side by side with other beers in this style category. Enjoyable."
"Not a good example of a Belgian at all, and this beer says it is brewed with green raisins but I don't taste it at all. Unbalanced, hard to drink, and not recommended unless you just like to try ""new"" things. For that reason you may want to check it out. It's unlike anything I've had to date."
"Another great beer from Dogfish Head. Poured from the bottle into one of their glasses. A nice head and a dark color, darker than I was expecting. The nose is of strong mahogany and hops. The taste is also very strong on mahogany. Its an 8% beer and the alcohol is hidden very well. Don't know if I would drink more than two though in one sitting. All around a great beer."
"I would say though...that you probably need to develope a bit of a taste for it...it doesn't usually come right out as a smash hit on the first try. But it will stick in the back of your mind...and you'll return for another one someday...and that's when you'll realized how good it is."
"On the whole, this beer is just fine with me. Complex, but not too busy. Not great, for sure, and I would rather have any number of DFH beers over this one, but this is a good beer. I revisit this one once or twice a year, and I don't see that changing. Not a great example of a Belgian Strong Ale, in my opinion, but a good enough beer to drink."
"Let this beer warm a bit and you'll enjoy it more..."
"D - The alcohol is no where to be found in flavor or nose making it pretty easily drinkable. The flavor and sweetness get slightly cloying though. Great overall. Another DFH success."
"The body is a little thinner than expected, but enjoyable nonetheless. Average drinkability, you could drink a couple of these in a row, I'm just not sure you'd want to. This beer is sort of boring and uninteresting. I'm not sure what the brewers were aiming for with this beer and I'm not sure this is the proper style category either. I should rate this beer lower because it doesn't fit the style, but I did enjoy it, to a point, and will drink it again."
"Not one of Dogfish Heads best or more interesting. I expect more from them."
"This was an interesting brew, yet I can't say it made me want another. It's worth a try, but just needs a bit more oomph in the flavor profile and perhaps a thicker body."
"not gonna be able to drink many of these in a sitting, it's just too sweet and too much malt to even try to be an ale, totally different beer when cold, it'll turn your stomach when warm"
"Conclusion: I'm not sure what it is about this that I'm not really into...it's a bit too sweet, one dimensional, and just honestly a bit dull for me...definitely not the best offering by DFH"
"All and All I really couldn't find what most were dissapointed in. This is an exceptional beer. I would definetly buy this again."
"This isn't bad, but not too interesting or exciting. I really preferred its ""big brother", Raison D'extra, which I thought was excellent."
"I prefer the hoppier IPAs and the Imperial Stouts, so this one stretches me a little. Won't buy it again any time soon, but it's a good beer."
"I also had this on tap at the Falls Church ""Alehouse"" last summer. I remember it tasting much different than this. It had a much more assertive caramel malt presence. I really enjoyed it then, which is why I wanted to try it again. Unfortunately, things didn't work out so well the second time around."
"Verdict: Another solid and unique offering from Dogfish Head. Raison D'Etre has a complex flavor profile, with a hell of a lot going on in just one glass. This is a great beer to sip in the evening and ponder over."
"drinkability: easy and smooth. but not my favortie."
"D: a bit on the boring side. I felt fuzzy and warm rather fast with only half the glass gone. One and done for this guy"
"D: I want to drink it a little faster than I normally would due to the chalky aftertaste. Unfortunately, that doesn't mean its more drinkable. I like the flavor, but for some reason its still a bit of a struggle for me."
"Raison D'etre is, of course, French for ""reason for living"". To quote Norm McDonald, ""Note to self: I don't want to live!""."
"An all-around revolting little beer. Oily and thin with strange fruit like it was in an old cheap wine bottle. I guess we have the raisins to thank for that. The first second is the best with this beer, which opens up into a strange, sick-sweet flavor and finishes leaving you wanting no more. I generally love Dogfish Head beers, but c'mon, beer and raisins? This one never had a chance."
"Addendum: Cellared for a year, this is much smoother and more cohesive. I would think of this as a strong Dubbel rather than a BSDA myself with the vinous sweet aroma and strong rum raisin overtones. I adjusted a couple of scores upward."
"This is a very pleasant brew. I've seen reviews saying it's too sweet or sticky, but I wasn't hit with that at all. Maybe the way it was stored? Anyway, I've got to rate this up a little."
"pretty flavorful but everything else is just standard. not very good for drinking in the sun. it is pretty thick and it leaves you feeling pretty good feeling for its abv. because it comes in six packs and alot of dogfish brews dont, id recommend purchasing it over any of the other dogfish brews."
"Ok... first off, I have no idea why this beer has such a low rating, I think its awesome.. However I do notice it is listed as a Belgian strong dark.. Never would I have assumed this was a belgian dark (I dont even like Belgian darks! Ever!!) I know Dogfish says they used Belgian-style yeast, but, again, I would say this is more of a sweet hybrid-brown ale or something... Anyway.. The appearance is a beautiful ruby, almost burgundy when light passes through it reminiscent of the beet sugar in the ingredients (not that I know if a beet's sugar is the same color as a beet).. The aroma is bit of a weak point, its definitely nice with malt and a bit raisiny with a presence from the grapes used, but its sort of subdued and would be nicer if a bit more prominent. The taste has a lot of malt but, like aroma, in a more subdued way.. It doesn't have a huge presence like a doppelbock or Dogfish's Palo Santo or such, but thats sort of nice for this beer, giving it a bit more drinkability in a social setting. There is brown sugar in the taste and a bit of dryness in the clean aftertaste. Mouthfeel is really nicely balanced, a lighter moderate with carbonation thats not biting. I think its pretty great, maybe the characteristics could be a bit bolder, but their subtlety may be the beer's strength.."
"Overall, it seems Dogfish Head wanted to apply the extreme brewing philosophy to Belgian-style beers. The success is decidedly mixed."
"D - Finally introduced myself to the Dogfish Head Brewery, with a new style. I'm not sure if I'd know what to pair this with for perfection, but I had a strong urge to eat freshly picked figs and pears afterwards."
"Has a strong raisiny sweetness about it, but the wrong body type for that sweetness in my opinion. The strong raisiny sensation doesn't really have any balance. By the end, it has turned into a slightly sour raisiny flavor, and not sour in a real good way. Like an ascetic burnt bitterness. There doesn't seem to be much of a step B between steps A and C. Mouth is hugely cloying and coating, but there really isn't much carbonation to move things along, which in this case would help bigtime. Drinkability suffers as a result of all of the above."
"edited 8/22/10"
"D - Nice weight, balanced and unique taste would keep me coming back. Probably a little too sweet for extended sessions."
"Overall it's pretty good for what it is, I enjoyed it, but not the best representation of a Belgian Strong Dark."
"Dispite the unusual addition of raisins, the subtle complexities of this beer still excell."
"I like this beer, but it doesn't represent the style well in my opinion. I think that DFH can do better."
"Poured a slightly cloudy, dark copper with a small cream colored head. I got a sense of dried fruit, but not necessarily raisin. You get a sense of the high ABV, yet this brew is pretty easy drinking. There seem to be alot of flavors going on here, but they meld together quite pleasantly."
"D: Just got the one, and don't want a second. It's an interesting experiment, and my first raisin beer -- although I've seen a couple of Lost Abbey attempts at the store -- and I'm glad I tried it. I just don't think it's worth seeking out again."
"This was the second time I've had this, and on both occasions I bought the single beer. Glad I didn't shoot a pile of money on a six. This is a one and done at best. Even on a bitter cold day I'd have trouble getting more than one down (even one complete one down). Did not like this at all. Lots of good things going for it, but the complete picture is not there."
"glad the folks at publix did not have this one in the computer and she only charged me 7 bucks for the 6 pack so I can live with it. But I can only drink 1 at a time and that's only when i already half crocked."
"Poured dark reddish brown with a real small head that receded to the edges after about 30 seconds. Great brown malty smell, but undeniably sweet. Definitely a little thicker on the mouthfeel. Strong nutty/sugary malty tones, and the booze (8.0%ABV) definitely shows through a little at end -- but just fine with me. Good brew, but wouldn't grab more than one or two without switching it up."
"First time trying non IPA from Dogfish Head. It has a very nice color and head. first taste is sweet with spicy finish. The beer gets sweeter as it warms. Very good initial taste, but gets too sweet after a while. Good beer to have one of, but not a six pack."
"Good, almost sessionable. Excellent for cold weather."
"Apparently though my palate now likes super-hoppy things, it still does not like raison d'etre."
"I was slightly disappointed. I should have gone with the 60 minute from DFH."
"In the end, this beer is a letdown... nothing terrible, but I wanted more."
"Poured a deep amber body with no surprises. On the nose it was a bit sweet, the beet sugar and the raisin scent was a bit reminiscing yet seemed to be over powered by a pure sugar and alcohol front. The taste was not as pleasing as expected. The alcohol dominated with little or no balance on the finish, after warming up a bit the taste seemed to separate and oil out with a heavy to thick syrup body. Dried fruit was present but the alcohol was still to forward to allow a good harmony. I could see pairing this with a meal, maybe even braising a piece of meat with it furthering its unique crafting. I am glad I tried but probably won't drink again."
"The 4 pack will take me a few weeks I would guess, not something I really am craving after having one. So I gave it kinda a low score on drinkability."
" As stated above, the ABV% seems to be a bit lower than what's on the bottle. No matter, I don't get the impression that this is a belgian-style beer, but it's a welcome change from Dogfish Head's other peculiar and hoppier offerings. For a late winter night like this, this fits the bill quite nicely!"
"Overall, this is a decent beer to try but is not worh going far out of the way to try. Another good beer from Dogfish Head."
"Couldn't see buying this beer again. Admittedly, it's not my preferred style and I think the this is a fine beer, but the sweetness is just too much. I'd have a difficult time drinking more than one of these in a sitting."
"Belgians are not on the top of my palates desires but I thoroughly enjoyed this beer."
"Deep red and crystal clear with a slight off white head that leaves fine lace on the glass. Not a lot going on in the nose, faint metallic and bready notes. Tastes unusual, I can taste the raisins and beet sugar along with roasted malts and slight bittering hops in the finish. Sticky medium bodied mouthfeel. Drinkable, but not my favorite from DFH or what I really look for in the style."
"Feel and Drinkability: The beer leaves the tongue feeling thick and heavy, almost the way the palate feels when parched. Carbonation is low and suits the beer. Hints at a warming sensation when swallowed. This beer is full bodied and leaning towards thick on the palate, I feel like alot of residual sugar gives it this feeling....it does however work for the beer. This one is easy to drink, however, I'm not sure how readily I'd pick it up again. I'm sure I'll eventually be buying this and drinking it again, but I can't see myself doing it anytime soon. It's a good beer but nothing all that great. Don't get me wrong, its great, but for me it just doesn't have anything that pulls me back tot the beer, nothing that I truely love about it."
"Overall a decent, but not great, example of the style."
"It's nice. I like to keep it around. Is it on the same level as the 90 minute? Not for me. Certainly worth a try, though, as it is fairly unique and interesting."
"Mouthfeel is medium body, with crisp but light carbonation. Little bit dry on the finish as a result. A bit heavy on the raisiny-dark fruitiness in the overall balance."
"Pours an amber red colored body, clear, not very fizzy. Has a small tan head, diminishing. An aroma of dark fruit, and raisins maybe. Strong sugary malty. Malty salty taste, dark roasted malt aftertaste. Sweet carmelized taste."
"Drinkability is so/so. I'd much rather have other offerings from DFH and a true Belgian when craving Belgian."
"This very drinkable for the style."
"Mouthfeel/drinkability: Feels smooth and creamy in the mouth. Its also sweet and bitter which is interesting. I like it but I dont get this beer."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, somewhat light for this style. Has a good crispness to it though. I enjoyed this bottle but the sweetness would definitely stop me from having more than one serving. Good, though."
"Tasted a little sweet, again heavily with fruit, particularly raisins, malt and light yeast."
"D - Not the best DFH that I have had, but still an interesting beer to go along with their others"
"Nice mahogany color with a tan head. Nose has sweet malts, and spicy Belgian yeasts. The taste also has a nice malt profile, but is not super complex. A good beer, but I'd like to see more Belgian characteristics. Medium body is well carbonated and drinks well."
"Overall - I thought this was some sort of dark amber ale with a lot of malts and raisins. The balance seemed a little off centered, but then again, this is made by an off centered brewery for off centered people. Then I found out that it's a Belgian strong dark ale... hmm, I don't think this one fits the bill. Sorry DFH, although this was tasty, I really can't see this fitting into the category. A good beer, nonetheless. Enough with the labeling. This is one I shall revisit in the future."
"(D) This took a few swigs to get use to, but then I was into it. This brew has some interesting flavorings going on."
"Drinkability: This is a another unique tasting beer that needs to be drunk slow because of its high alcohol content. I would be excited to pick this one up again, although I think two is my limit per sitting due to ABV...This one won me over"
"Delicious in it's own way, but nowhere near similar to any others in it's class."
"Perhaps not quite the Raison d'Etre, but a Raison de boire? I'll buy that one."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, good kick, nice representation of style but like most DFH beers, it's not your typical beer in its style. This is a good beer to drink for a long time if you're in the mood for some thing with a little strength and a lot of substance."
"Poured this beer into my favorite Duck-Rabbit glass. This beer poured a nice head that didnt disapate too quickly, with a nice deep red color. The smell was nothing too impressive. The taste is slightly sweet, also with a hint of hops. The mouthfeel is not too thick and smooth. Overall an aright beer but nothing sticking out too much."
"I find the different flavors to be harmonious and to balance each other out, and could happily drink more than the 2 I limit myself to on any single evening, due to the substantial ABV. If not for the alcohol level of this brew, I would call it an excellent daily beer, and enjoy it frequently on a weeknight after the kids are in bed."
"I am going to try the D'Extra but if it's double the taste of this then forget about it."
"D: This one grew on me as I drank it, but it was still one of the most scatterbrained beers I've had in a long time. I appreciate it and find it interesting, but I'll probably not seek it out in the future."
"Strong work by DFH overall. More in the nose would be nice. But deceptively smooth and drinkable for a relatively big beer."
"Pours a clear mahogany with an off-white head. Smell is not attractive: noes of sweet malts and an almost locker-room scent that is a bit startling. Taste, on the other hand, is pretty good: brown sugar and toffee maltiness with a woodsy bitterness. Medium body is spot on the money. An interesting beer whose aromas are incongruous with its taste."
"D: Grabbed this on a whim for about $2.50 for a 12oz. I had once before and remember liking it a little more. A solid offering but DFH has many other offerings I would try again over this one. Figured it was a historic day thus making it as good of a day as any to have a beer."
"Overall this is an interesting beer, but it doesn't do a whole lot to excite me. Still, it's worth a shot."
"D - Easy to drink and very enjoyable but to strong to session"
"Clear brown-amber color with minimal effervescence, average head foam, dark orange rims. Roasted dark chocolate and coffee in the nose, the raisin and dried fruit character comes through clearly, texture is smooth and malty without giving up a fresh and lively feel. Medium-bodied, sweet and sugary with rum raisin, plum, molasses and candied orange flavors. Heavy, not in a pure weight sense per se, just clings like syrup. Not much carbonation, this allows the flavors to all sink in completely. Notes of cinnamon mulled cider. Not for everyone but very captivating."
"m/d - Not real thick or syrupy, not too thin. Tasty enough, but at 8% and with it being a little unique it's a sipper and I'd only have one. Not an all night session beer but I'd drink it again."
"I like the stickiness of this beer. It wasn't too much where it leaves the candy-like syrupy feeling in back of your throat lingering for too long, but was still enough to please me. It also was not too heavily bodied, which means that even though the flavor is pretty unique, it doesn't hurt the overall drinkability too badly. Can't wait to have something else by this brewery in the future."
"Mouthfeel:"
"Had some sweet golden raisins with this. Paired pretty well."
"This beer is solid if not spectacular. I would be happy to have a couple in the fridge at any given time."
"I like Dogfish's IPA's so I decided to give this a try. Has a nice mahogany color, a deep malty taste but a decent mouth feel. It's even a bit sweet. It goes down really good and does not bite back, I really enjoyed it and I would get it again. Give it a try."
"This worked when used as a beer to take the edge off of digging countless people out of parking lots at work while being hectored by a frazzled, semi-worthless supervisor, and then not being able to buy ingredients for a planned dinner entree because the store I stopped at had a roof that was in danger of collapse due to no one clearing off the snow for three weeks (not that I'm venting). However, I'm thinking any beer would taste good in that light. Otherwise, while being a decent beer, I don't think there's enough here to bring me back to it."
"I am tasting the mettalic aftertaste in this.Good beer if I could get paste the metal."
"D - I enjoyed one, but I don't know that I'd be able to finish two. It's a rich beer meant to be savored slowly."
"Pours with virtually no head in a pint glass. Smells like sugar and chocolate oddly. Deep mahogany color just like the bottle says. Taste is sweet, only thing that's hints at being beer is the malt. Overall not very drinkable. Too thick and complex to drink more than one."
"I taste raisins, caramel, alcohol, and something else. The only thing I don't like with this great off-centered beer is the alcohol sting. Too boozy! It's a little harsh on my palate, but hay, it's still one of the greatest dessert beers Iv'e had."
"5/4/5/3/10 (2.7/5)"
"M/D - It is a heavier beer with a heavy body. Not much carbonation but it is very creamy on the tongue and goes down smooth."
"Drinkability: It's an interesting beer. Definitely not a session beer, but it's a beer worth savoring every sip. It's different than anything I've had so far. This is something I'd definitely have to be in the mood for to drink. It's a beer that it's hard for me to tell if I like or not."
"I poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a standard pint glass. The beer pours a dark caramel and is very clear when held up to a light. The head is somewhat thin and does nto stick around long. The aroma is of ripe fruit, because green raisins are in the ingredients, and raisins. The taste is sweet and malty up front. The finish is fruity with a slight alcohol kick. This is less boozy than some of the other dark Belgians I have had, which is not a bad thing. The beer is medium bodied and goes down way too easily. Not the best of the style I have had. Perhaps a bit more drinkable than most."
"It's drinkable, but I wouldn't reach for another one."
"Taste was very MALTY. Some dark coffee up in the mix with again, some dark fruits. Very rich overall."
"Taste: Burnt coffee roasts, spice, and a sharp spike of carbonated alcohol give way to a smooth espresso aftertaste and dark, dark bitter chocolate-coated hops."
"D: Drinkability is pretty average, I've had belgian dark ales that went down easier."
"(rated Apr 26, 2007)"
"The best thing about this beer is it's coloring. The beer pours a rich light brown with copper hue. There is a quickly disapating off white head. Aroma is very musty and not very alluring. Flavor is disapointing too. No balance of flavors or much a direction to style either. There are rough malt flavors and some flavor reminiscent of wine. This beer leaves a sweet bitter aftertaste to it. Very light carbonation, slightly gummy or chewy ...muddy body. I've enjoyed other brews by Dogfish, but this one isn't for me."
"Future outlook: Well, it's a decent enough beer, but with so many great choices out there, I probably won't meddle with this one again anytime soon."
"Dark mahogany with a slight purple tint. Smells good but not a strong nose. Tastes of raisins and dark fruits. Overall decent but this is the first DFH I've had that didn't completely knock my socks off. I find myself wishing for a lineup from DFH more in line with that of other craft brewers. But then they wouldn't be DFH, would they?"
"Ahh, it a pun. Pours hazy gold with a tiny white head. Plenty of green raisins in this one. Aroma of a box of the things upon opening. Some honey and grain as well. The sugar gives it a trappist aroma and taste, but with more sweetness. Silky mouthfeel with a sticky finish. Enjoyable beer."
"Drinkability - Not bad on a cold night (or morning) like this... I could drink about 2 or 3 and be done. This is a good beer to go to bed on."
"3.0	4.5	3.5	3.5	3.5"
"D - As I said, I've put a few of these back in my day. I'm good for one or two, and it works very well with food. If we're rating as a strict Belgian Strong Dark, it fails miserably, but I really just think DFH wanted to make a strong brown brewed with raisins and beet sugar. In that respect, it's a very good beer. If we're judging it against Chimay Blue or Gulden Draak, it's a failure. I prefer to think of it in terms of the former - a nice strong, malty American Brown brewed with raisins. In that context, it's a success."
"D- Very drinkable and would love it as a standard at the pub, but since DFH isn't around here it's just another good beer to have while traveling."
"Pours a small head with a mostly clear brown body. Heavy on the malt and light on the hops. A plethora of smells make up this brew including cherry, wood, coffee, brown sugar, and maple sugar, but most especially the raisins which give it it's name. It is medium bodied with a creamy texture and carbonation that leans to the softer side. Very sweet! A decent beer but one that at 8% abv makes me want to drink something else after having just one."
"This beer was not a classic Belgian Strong Dark Ale by any means, but displayed gestures more prominent in the hoppiness of an IPA or the fruitiness of a cider beer. A solid offering from a fantastic brewery."
"Had this with dinner at Parrish Cafe. Poured from the bottle into a glass. Brownish orange color with a thin head. Smelled very sugary. Taste was good, but not great. Reminded me a lot like a dubbel, but thinner and much more sweeter. Had a very strong candied sugar or caramel flavor. Very faint flavor of grapes (almost port like) in the background. Should not have ordered with my meal, as it's more of an after dinner drink. Too sweet for a strong dark ale in my opinion."
"D: Well hidden alcohol content. Too sweet for my tastes really. More of a slow drinking beer."
"D: Heavy-handed use of Belgian beet sugars make this offering too damn sweet for session drinking. One and you're done."
"Overall, I would've been happier to say that it's an exceptional brown ale or even a really good bock but as a Belgian strong dark, it falls short. Still a very good beer."
"Bottle from the Clark Street Ale House in Chicago. Pours a dark brown color with a thin white head. The aroma was mostly roasted notes, and raisins. The taste was full of sweet burnt sugars and malts, some chocolate and a bit of plum. Very nice. An interesting brew."
"D. Not a bad belgian, but there are better examples out there."
"Overall I liked the beer. I might buy it again in the future but it will be up against the other Dogfish Head beers I'm a fan of and thats a tough line up!"
"A good beer, no doubt its enjoyable, but as a caveat, I'm already feeling a buzz halfway through this beer. Honestly, I'm glad I tried it, but there are other labels I would go to before this one."
"Drinkability--excellent after dinner beer. Or breakfast. I think this would be a better beer with a slightly drier finish, but a good buy if you see it in your beer store."
"Smooth and creamy mouthfeel, rich and full feel without being overly sticky or cloying. A bit sweet, would like to see how it ages."
"Pours a bright amber/brown color with a small head that fades off quickly. Smells of dark fruits, figs, raisins, perhaps some yeast, definitely malty. Taste is very ""green"" along with ripened fruits like figs and dates. Earthy, some yeast notes, malty sweet. Sort of strange flavor going on, not off taste, just strange. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, good carbonation, slightly dry. I can enjoy one of these but it stops there."
"D: A touch sweet with a considerable abv of 8.00% will limit this to a one trick pony drinkability wise, but its not to say you shouldn't try it as it provides an unique flavor and experience."
"O: Its good, but with a standard Sam sets with some of his other brews, this one barely makes the cut. Definetally a lot better paired with some pulled pork sandwiches. Mmhhmmm..."
"This is a great regular beer. The color is a light brown with great carbonation. The aroma is sweet, a little spicy, a definate aroma of green raisons. the flavor is sweet, very complex, a little bitter. The mouthfeel is a medium feel and the drinkablity is good. a great beer for malt lovers."
"This is an interesting beer for sure so I am glad that I tried it, but it is probably not something I would buy again."
"Tastes of a nice spicy clove like peppers up front, tamarind sweet-tartness, raisin sweetness, followed by malts, ends with a long tingling throat-warming finish. Mouthfeel is very palate filling, but has a well balanced finish, I find highly drinkable and enjoyable. Maybe not a quote-on-quote BSPA, but when does Dogfish ever produce industry-standard beers? This is a lighter example of the style, a more drinkable, modified version.Give it a try with an open mind."
"To me, this is DFH's best beer.. at leas so far anyway. It's a pretty high ABV but you cannot even taste it at all. Smells and tastes of brown sugar and other sweetness and the taste is so smooth and mouthfeel perfect. It's almost like liquid candy, but it's not so overly sweet that it turns you off. I've come back to this one a few times and will continue to do so."
"Very drinkable, this beer really hides the alcohol very well. Very tasty, strong beer from Dogfish."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: Mouthfeel is medium. Carbonation is well balanced. This very much reminds me of a belgian dubbel, which I was not expecting. A unique beer for sure that you should try at least once."
"This beer is excellent, I love its sweetness and complexity. It pours dark brown, recently Ive been trying to drink this beer from a snifter due to its great nose. I routinely buy 6 packs of this beer as it is pretty drinkable and just overall delicious. great dark ale."
"I'm guessing this one is not low on calories. But, with all that - this one is a good beer I'd like to see regularly in my rotation."
"Different taste, but pretty good makes this another good dogfish head beer."
"Dark amber - kinda brown with a light tan head. Faint aroma of sweet and roasted malts. Tastes first kinda smokey and roasty, then sweet like caramel. A little oxidized too perhaps. Full bodied with soft carbonation. Minimal hops is good to let the malt and ""offbeat"" ingredients stand out more. Still not quite my thing though."
"The beer poured a rich amber with a tan head. The aroma was of sweet malt and raisans. The taste is rich sweet malt, with hints of raisan. It's even a bit winelike, with no hops to mention. The feel is heavy and a bit wet. This is a very drinkable beer, a rich sweet dark lager with a bit extra."
"Reddish-copper body with a very small head that dissipated quickly. Dark fruit and sweet malt aroma, some nuttiness. Flavor mirrors the aroma - malty sweetness, some yeasty phenols and the dark fruit come through, perhaps a bit of hop spiciness, but nothing too powerful. Mouthfeel is well carbonated, about medium bodied. Overall, a fairly enjoyable beer. An acquired taste, not a session beer, but one that can be enjoyed one or two at a time."
"Overall, not a huge fan of the beer. It's very strong in what is there. The alcohol content isn't hidden very well - a bit acidic. It's not even a particularly good representation of the style. I suppose just another reason why I won't be picking up more DFH's."
"D: I like this, but I'm not too sure if I could drink a lot of them. Excellent with the steak I had for dinner though!"
"taste of caramel, spice, dark fruit, grain, nuts, some sweetness, ends oily with a touch of biter."
"2.5	D i do not plan on having more, but wouldn't completely dread"
"If the ABV% weren't so high I would rate this a 5 for drinkability, it goes down very smooth and has a very delicious taste to it that really helps but at 8% you really have to watch yourself."
"D. This is a good beer. Dogfish Head is consistently brewing good quality beers and is easily one of my favorite brewers. This is a perfect autumn beer that goes great with several firm white cheeses, Parmisan Reggianno, Compte, Fontinella, etc... or just sit back and drink a few with friends while watching the game. You will not be disappointed."
"Bottom Line: its a good get."
"Cheers"
"D: I would probably drink this a few at a time, but no more than that."
"D- Drinks great for the high ABV% if you're in the mood for something sweet"
"Poured a deep mahogany, dark ruby color with fine tan lacing. Wonderful aroma of prunes and molasses. Taste is of malty raisins, that is enjoyably unique, but just a little bit too sweet for my taste. The mouthfeel works fine with what little carbonation is present. This is a special beer that I will revisit, but not too frequently due to its sweetness. In the end, you need to at least give this solid brew a go. I have yet to be wronged by Dogfish Head."
"Like most all of Dogfish Head beers this one is more ""off centered"" sounding than it is tasting. As far as strong dark ales go this wouldn't hold a candle to Belgium's best but it does make for an enjoyable drink, and I think that's enough 'raison d'etre' to keep buying and drinking it."
"Pretty good ale. I'm going to try more from Dogfish Head. Tomorrow is going to be the 90 Minute IPA. They are hard to find though and expensive to boot."
"This pours a clear brown mahagony body with a thick tan head that settles down to patches quickly. The aroma is rather subtle with hints of a wood presence, dark fruits and just a little alcohol surfacing. The flavor is some roasted malts, a bunch of brown sugar along with sweet dark fruits. Finishes a little weak. Good beer and is very easy drinking considering the abv."
"This is the only beer i've ever had that I couldnt finish. I tried really hard to finish the bottle and man up, but this is now my number 1 least favorite beer. To each their own. I gave the other 5 away for friends to try."
"What a great tan, two-finger head this beer displayed when I poured it! The same medium size bubbles showed great retention and clung nicely to the glass leaving some nice, albeit broken lacing. Robust mahogany color. Sweet malts like malted milk balls (candy) on the nose. This persists one the tongue but the sugars quash the other flavors. I have trouble getting past the raisins, what else is there? Otherwise a smooth beer with a pleasant mouthfeel. But sadly, the head is the best part (and sometimes head is just a tease)!"
"Drinkability - The smokiness starts to overwhelm the more you drink it, but its still a solid easy drinking concoction."
"I can't see anything wrong with the brew, but something forces me to compare it to some other Dogfish makes that are much better. However, it is a sweet and easy drink, if you're into that."
"This beer is different than any thing else I've ever tried, for which I am very glad I did give this a go, but I will probably not visit this again anytime soon. Not bad, just different."
"Not an everyday beer but I found it enjoyable as a treat for something different. Dogfish Head definitely lives up to its motto of ""off-centered"" beers - I like that they try to put out something different."
"Pours a clear moderately dark amber color with a full finger light tan head that fades fairly quickly. Spotty patterns of lacing. The smell is aggressive, malty biscuit, caramel, pumpkin apple spice. Moderately carbonated, there is a tang of alcohol that mixes with a fruity spicy flavor. Medium light bodied, full flavored the malt character finishes beneath the smoky spicy sweet aftertaste. The earthy yeast and biscuit malt are overshadowed. A fairly complex beverage and a blast to consider. The 8% ABV is quite warming. Another unique interpretation. Recommended."
"D- not my type of beer, but for people into the fruity hints of simpler Belgian styles ales its worth a shot, not doing it for me though"
"It took a while but after coming back to this beer a few times I have come to fully appreciate all that there is to offer. Pours a dark amber color with a brown tint. There is a thick head that eventually settles down and a few lingering spots of lacing that lazily attempt to cling to the glass. The aroma is a subtle mixture of dark fruits and sweet malts accompanied by a sugary afterthought. As I sip from my glass the flavor comes alive. Sugary and sweet there is a dominant malt presence that tangles all of the fruity and spicy flavors together followed by a nice warming alcohol effect. The mouthfeel is wonderful and the finish is exceptionally dry. Wow this beer reminds me of a good dopplebock but with a unique twist. Much better if you allow this one to warm up for a while. Absolutely amazing."
"D- very enjoyable, but also very sweet. almost too sweet to have a couple of. a 6 pack would last me a long time."
"Poured a light reddish brown, a dark ruby in the light. A thin white head that that stayed around into a decent lacing. The aroma was a lot of malts with a hint of coffee. Taste was of coffee, malts and a hint of fruit. A little on the sweet side. Texture was good. Overall an enjoyable beer. I was a little leery about a beer with raisins in it. The balance was excellent, very smooth and not to heavy. A good session beer."
"D: There are far better beers in this category that exist. A rare misstep for DFH."
"Your average strong dark ale this beer is not. This beer pours brownish read with a small head that disappears quickly. The smell is sweet raisins. The alcohol is very upfront as is the sweet taste. The drinkability for this beer is moderate. This beer is a slow sipper for me. Overall this beer is certainly worth a try for those looking for a different take on the style."
"Poured a rich mahogany color with good clarity when held to the light. A two finger head drops to a solid cap that laces nicely down the glass. The smell is sweet, with notes of prunes and not surprisingly raisons, as well as a dark malt. Seems slightly cloying in the nose, and this translates to the flavor, cutting back on drinkablity. Though otherwise the flavor is nice, with sweet dark fruits up front going into a rich and coffee/espresso malty finish that finishes nicely. As said before it is a bit too sweet, but an interesting beer for sure. My only real complaint is that there is very little Belgian about this beer to me. I don't know what style to call this beer, but where Belgian strong dark ales have a refined complexity this beer has a loose impressionistic flavor that seems to fall in with american craft brews. I guess balance is what I am pointing towards, this beer doesn't really have it. Though it is still very enjoyable."
"Not real drinkable. Interesting brew, but I won't be needing another anytime soon. I can't always count of Dogfish for something eminently drinkable, but I'm never bored. Glad I tried this one, just like all the others."
"drinkability - Very nice sipper for late night. Lots of flavor of malts here. I have had this on tap and in a bottle. Both great everytime."
"It has a cough syrup color, reddish tint, and a medicine cabinet smell. Syrupy, sugary. The taste is one of synthetic sugars in a blender with Civil War grandma's cure for syphilis. But it has a syrupy, molasses-like taste that can be warming in the cold weather. This special beer has a great mouthfeel, it goes down smooth and leaves behind a dry sugar aftertaste. If tonight calls for strange behavior, a party with Bacchus on a rainy, cold day then this is the drink for the night."
"If I'm in a MALT mood then this is a good one."
"Notes: Nice stuff, glad I had the chance to try this. Got this as an extra from Azurelimits. Thanks!"
"Overall- Tasty but its slick alcohol/ medicine feel knocks it down a notch."
"Pours a dark brownish red in color with no head forming on the pour. It's a thin, translucent liquid. Smell is some sweetness and dark fruits. Taste is much the same, with something tart as well. Flavor gets a little cloying after a while. This is a very decent beer. Well done and no drawbacks."
"It is a decently drinkable beer, but I think that I'd wind up reaching for other ones before this one half of the time."
"M/D: Overall the beer was OK. The carbonation seemed right, but as stated above the beer seemed thick and entirely too sweet. We purchased a six pack and it will probably be the only one that we ever buy."
"Drinkability: Quaffable, but the back end is too harsh to make me reach for a second after getting through the first."
"D: A nice, drinkable beer with some warming alcohol. The alcohol was not too evident in the taste, although you will feel it. An excellent combination of mouthfeel and taste makes this beer nice and drinkable."
"d- surprised this won beer of the year, overrated and just plain not that good or complex."
"D: So So, would be more of a cordial or one I would recommend to the sweet toothers."
"D - Smooth, god beer but not my style. I liked it more than I thought I would after reading the ingredients but it's still too out there for me."
"D: Rather intriguing, but ultimately, probably not my cup of tea - or glass of beer. ;) Worth trying out, though, by all means."
"D - This is a pretty good Belgian style beer. Interesting flavors and quite drinkable."
"This did not blow me away, but was rather interesting. Worth a try."
"D- i just don't know about this one. i've ridden the bar on every DFH brew i've had and this so-called 'reason for being' is no different."
"D- Pretty solid beer overall. Probably not something I'd session but nice for a before bed beer or something on a winter night."
"This is an interesting beer. The acahol is way to strong, in the smell and on my tounge. The balance in this one is not there. I'd drink it again if it was free, but I wont buy it again."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable at the start but the finish becomes more pungent as it warms."
"Raison D'etra pours a hazy, dark, woody brown. (The bottle says mohagony and I have no reason to argue.) A very thin head sits on top. The nose has some sweet, sugary notes with some fruitiness. The taste shows some sweet fruitiness up front, followed by a light bitterness. The mouthfeel is slightly full and the carbonation is low. This beer really didn't impress me the way the other beers from Dogfish Head have."
"The color is dark like grape juice thats passed it prime by a year or two, reddish brown. Head was not noticeable a thick mocha suds. Smell is alcohol and like warmed wine with spices.The taste is like Belgian meets with raisin, and it isn't the greatness partnership of flavors. In some ways the blend almost makes me think peanut butter sandwich. Tastes, malty, sweet and rusty with a tiny hint of raisin Heavy alcohol burn to the tongue accompanied by slight bubbles. Overall not a bad beer, but not one I'd call a great beer, particularly from the standpoint of it being by dogfish head (I guess I have high expectations for their beer)."
"Personally, I love some of the other Dogfish Head brews a lot more than this one. But, thats just my opinion. Give it a shot and form your own. Nothing they brew can be considered anything but good and most of them are great. This one's unique thats for sure!"
"Nothing stands out too much with this brew. Just a very solid offering."
"I actually enjoyed this beer more than I thought I would, and would definitely drink it again if available."
"I'm glad I got to try this brew but it just doesn't do it for me, unlike the majority of DFH's brews. 1 bottle is more than enough and I wouldn't seek this out again, for sure. To me, the flavours are a mess."
"This beer is a delicacy that for some reason makes me think of a finer wine. Exquisite (with a Creme Brulee) and sophisticated."
"PS, Brothers, what the hell were you drinking? (cuz it certainly wasn't THIS beer!)"
"I must say, I think this beer is grossly under-rated. An excellent and inspiring example of how American brewers have pushed the traditional boundaries of specific beer styles."
"Final Thought: Haven't played around too much with the style, but it is a solid offering from a great brewery."
"In addition to liking cold beer, I like high alcohol content. I'm in the military, and I like my beers like I like my women: intoxicating. Sessionable? Hells yes!"
"An citrus marinated fowl woould go great with this beer."
"Biggest surprise in a while...i expected to hate this beer, the name put me off, reviews weren't favorable....but you know what this is a damn tasty brew worth trying."
"I'd certainly recommend this one, but not something I'd get everyday."
"I'm actually surprised to see that this beer is rated as low as it is, because I find it one of the most engaging beers from the American craft circuit. This beer combines some of the most desirable aspects from a good pale ale, porter, and mild stout."
"This poured a lovely mahogany, reddish/brown color. On top is a thick white head that faded off quickly to just a thin ring around the glass. The aroma is full of sweet roasted malts and raisins. The flavor is full of roasted malts, caramel, toast and green grapes. A light hop bitterness balances out the sweetness. Its medium to full body and soft carbonation gives it a velvety smooth mouth feel. This is a good Belgian ale that I will be enjoying again real soon."
"Poured a nice mahogany with a very disappointing head. Aroma is full of sugar, alcohol, and caramel and dried fruit..myabe raisins. Quite nice. The taste is nice as well, fruity, with roasted malt flavors all thru it. Maybe the sweetness is a little run in it. The mouthfeel is quite different to say the least. The ABV is 8 and it shows. No way I could or would want to drink more than one."
"In a nutshell, sweet as a game 7 victory. And there's a shark on the label."
"I love the names of Dogfish Head's brews. I enjoyed this one chilled in my Duvel bubbler. Poued a fine, clear amber color. Smells if dried raisons and mild cancied sugars. Tastes of sweet green raison with a tad alcohol dryness. This was a pretty decent brew."
"Final thought is I will not purchase this for some time. I expected more."
"Yes sir, I would like another. Two would definitely be my limit. 8% ABV is not particularly high, but Raison D'Être has a sweet flavor that could turn on my stomach if I had a few too many. I would highly recommend as a night cap any night. This is a fine creation and I applaud the efforts going on in Delaware."
"Notes: But for the smooth mouthfeel and prickly carbonation, I would not have been shocked if you'd told me this was an English Barleywine. Too sweet for me and not what I expected for the style."
"D-Smooth and tasty. Alcohol is well-hidden. I would buy this again."
"Poured into an oversized wine glass which produced a small ½ finger head that immediately disappeared. Nice reddish brown color with some carbonation. It had a strange aroma that smelled a little like bacon not too impressive. The taste was similar with hints of bacon, decomposing leaves, and campfire smoke. I really didn't care for this one at all and came close to just dumping it out. I'm not sure if I just got a bad batch of this or what because I have enjoyed all the other Dogfish Head beers I've tried. I'll have to try this one again in the future to see if something was wrong with the bottle I tried."
"Had over at my parent's house on Thursday night before dinner. Poured from the bottle into a pint glass. Pours a light brown with moderate head. Nothing in the smell or taste. A relatively mediocre beer that didn't really deliver from Dogfish Head. Probably wouldn't purchase this one at my own will."
"Smells of many things..hints of coffee and brown sugar and butterscocth. Poured into..what else..a Raison D'Etre goblet. Had it for a while but never tried the beer. Pours to an opaque medium brown that lets slight light through. Taste is very complex. Heavy texture and sweet but also sour. Malty with only trace hops evident. The AC is evident but not overly so. The lacing is incredible, looks like wine, the best i've ever seen. This is a delight in a goblet. Dogfish continues to delight."
"d - this was interesting. As a belgian strong dark ale, it's not something I would compare to a chimay blue. The alcohol is very present and the mouthfeel is a little unappetizing. It is also very sweet to the point of almost unenjoyable. I had this experience with the sam adams double bock, and this beer was running on the thin ice that the sam adams fell through. I can say I had it, but if I want a belgian strong dark ale I'll have a chimay."
"M&D: Looking at this you would think you are about to embark on a rather heavy drink but in reality this comes off rather light. The carbonation is also light, and goes well with the rest of the personality of this brew. It's smooth drinking and sort of easy going in its own way. I liked it, but there isn't anything that jumps out at me and screams ""this is great!"" I would drink it again though."
"D: DFH may not make the most drinkable brews - on this I'm definitely 'one & done' - but they certainly craft unique flavors. Be curious and give this a try - appreciate the creativity of the craft of brewing because this one definitely pushes the boundaries."
"D - I found this to be a boring beer. Not bad, but nothing overly exciting either."
"Very tasty, but really sweet and raisiny. A nice occasional, but heavy with an ABV that makes it a sipper. Not my favorite Dogfish Head offering or style of brew, but not bad, either."
"Low to medium carbonation. The alcohol taste is not very well hidden and is a bit much in this beer, but I did enjoy slowly sipping it with a big slice of Sicilian pizza. The alcohol warming would makes this a nice wintertime sipper. There was nothing really special that made this beer stand out, but I'd recommend at least trying it."
"D - A unique well crafted and complex brew... A would drink again because I think I could find new complexity each time I indulged, but not a session beer..."
"Poured a dark brownish amber color. Smell is pretty tame, maybe a little bit of a brown sugar smell coming through. I have to admit I don't have a lot of experience with Belgian style beer, but I wasn't a huge fan of this one. It reminds of a really good, low alcohol rum. It definitely a descent beer, and it's high quality, you can tell, and I know Dogfish Head is an awesome brewery, but this just doesn't do it for me. I probably won't get another one, but I would drink it if someone gave me one."
"Drinkability: I've always liked this one. I can see how it's a polarizing brew, but I'm on the positive side here and could enjoy a couple."
"D: Not a big fan of many Belgian styles, but this one is a keeper."
"It is very slick in the mouth with little carbonation, goes down easy enough though. Not a session beer but drinkable, will have one more then shelve the rest."
"D: I think the concept behind this beer is good. However, I feel that in the end the flavors do not mesh as well as I had hoped. The texture is weak and incongruent with the weight of the flavor. I would rate it low on drinkability."
"This was definitely a unique beer. It had a strong flavor of roasted malt and raisins, with just a little bitterness to make sure you still remember it's a serious beer. This was similar to a red, but with more character. It's milder than I prefer, but still pretty good."
"This isn't my favorite beer, but if offered this, I'd drink it especially with a meal."
"Overall- interesting brew all-around and nothing boring here at all, which seems to be DFH's purpose in brewing."
"I am not a fan of this beer. Some sort of metallic characteristic seems to show up in in very aspect of this beer. This is not something I will try again."
"D: This beer is a unique mishmash of uncommon flavors.... could be really good with some refinement, or possibly toned down a bit, but the heaviness of the mouthfeel is a bit much. For me, this probably works best as a dessert beer after a big meal. One is definitely enough."
"D- While I couldn't drink this beer all the time it's something I would go back to. I expected it to be sweet so it came through in that department and although it might be towards the cloying end if you go in expecting that then I think it can fit in well."
"Verdict: I'm always up for new and interesting takes on a style, but this is a swing-and-a-miss for me."
"Drinkability: Not a bad beer. It's just that its type of sweetness makes it too much of a soda/beer hybrid for my taste, and there's no complexity in there. The alcohol is too obvious too. Nothing truly special about it."
"D= While I cannot say that this is my favorite beer in the world, it sure goes down deceptively easy for such a high abv brew (8%). This beer is a good choice for those who don't like to be ""challenged"" by the taste of other high abv brews such as certain Belgian ales, barley wines, etc."
"D: Worth a try as it is a Dogfish Head, but I probably won't buy another sixer. Went well with my blackened chickend."
"Mouthfeel: The beer consistancy is great, good texture and coats my mouth well. I wish the roastedness and bitterness would subside quicker and not overpower the beer."
"d: This is a pretty good beer, but DFH has some much better brews in their lineup that I'll stick to."
"Poured a clear amber to ruby red with a thin white head that quickly dissolved but left some nice lacing throughout. Smell was of malts with some raisin and molasses. Tasted of sweet malts and fresh raisin. It brought back great memories of a growler of East End Dubbel Trubbel I had last week. There was a spicy finish with some hop bitterness which rounded it out nicely. I could drink this all night and day. I don't know what it is but raisins just do it for me in beer."
"A lot of people are turned off by this brew, but it's a nice every day beer in my opinion. Very good marks for this one."
"I enjoyed this one -"
"This is a great beer from Dogfish Head, and definitely worth a try."
"D- I could have some of these but not a huge fan. A strong aftertaste turns me off a bit."
"M/D: Full bodied, pretty high on the carbonation, a bit crisp. Drinkability is OK. This beer actually feels like a much bigger beer (although an 8% strong dark ale is no slouch). Still, it lacks some redeeming qualities in both the appearance and nose, which make it a bit underwhelming."
"Dogfish, in my opinion one of the top 3 breweries in the US. Raison D'etre is to me their greatest year round brew. so unique and tasty. Definitley a must try if you have not had one yet. pours well, strong nose and full of flavor. with just the right amount of abv"
"A dark maroon pour that still let light through, in a tulip. Uniquely sweet smell of burnt brown sugar, funky yeast, a touch of perhaps raison, and ash or charred spice. Dark flavors, but light body and easy to drink for the most part. Kind of a drying sweetness, and an odd taste, but not too bad. Not quite what I expected."
"The weak point of this beer is the aroma, which is overly metallic and not indicative of some of the complexity you will experience. The beer pours a nice deep amber, or mahogany as it is described on the label. There is a slight head that stick around a little while, not much lacing. The beer is slightly more caronated, slightly less syrupy, and has slightly less candied sugars than you will find in a typical Belgian. What you will get are lots of heavy fruits - figs, rind, raisin -- blended quite nicely. This is a nice, enjoyable, full bodied beer with complexity. I don't know if it's a very good Belgian, per se, but how often are labels misnomers anyway. As the Bros mentioned, the ABV is a bit too pronounced. You don't get a throaty burn, but there is a liquor taste to this one that you'll get start to finish. I knocked some points off drinkability as a result. Worth seeking out. L'Chaim."
"D - A nice sipper overall, but for Dogfish Head, I was expecting something a bit more complex. For a belgian style, this is pretty simplistic. Worth a try."
"D: Quite good. The alcohol is very apparent for something that is only 8% abv. I like this and will seek it out on draft."
"D: I'm a huge DFH guy, but not on this one; sorry."
"A nice Belgian Strong Ale from DFH. Not the best, but a nice example of the style."
"Overall, a good beer. I think its strong point was its appearance. It had a yellow-reddish tint to it, sort of hazy. Had a good nose, and you can definitely notice the raisins. The taste was citrus based with raisin undertones, and left a smokey after taste. Not a session beer, but worth trying."
"D-Alright in my book...goes down smooth with a decent flavor despite the mid-high ABV."
"Aroma is moderate malts, some light hops, raisins and peaches, pretty good. Appearance consits of a dark red body with some good lacing. Tastes much like it smells and goes down really well with a creamy texture and some lively carbonation playing with your tounge."
"After two these my head is warm, more drinkable than typical for the 'style' but there's no need for more now..."
"The Raison d'etre poured a nice mahogany color with very little foam head and no retention. The smell was raisins and oranges. The flavor was supremely all malt with a bit of nutmeg. In the mouth it was thin and left its mark on the roof of the mouth. Overall I have enjoyed most of the Dogfish's brew but this one didn't do it for me."
"Yet this is not a great BSDA, far from it. The bottle's label announces that it is a beer with ""a sense of purpose."" If so, it should be more readily evident to its consumers, for if anything, this lacks a strong identity, suffering from having several nice qualities but none that take this beer to the upper echelon."
"d: A lot going on, not much balance, unique for sure, but I don't think I'll pony up $9.49 for another 6-pack. In my opinion, this is one of Dogfish Head's lessor beers."
"Slightly hazy, deep copper color with a moderate, light tan head. The head shrinks to a layer just on top of the beer. A fruity smell mixed with a light hop aroma. The raisins are definitely evident. A roasted, malty smell rounds out the aroma nicely. A moderate hop character balances well with the aggressive malt profile. Caramel is noticeable along with a fruity taste on the back of the tongue. Medium bodied with a nice level of carbonation. The alcohol is noticeable and tingles the tongue and throat. A good beer to try."
"Had this before and decided to try it on draft at the Tap House in Maryland. Mistake, sort of, on my part. Came a tad colder than it should've w/ no real head and no lacings, but I didn't hold it against the beer. Had a nice dark copper/mahogany color but in the smell all I could really pick up was some spices and malts. It almost had a coffeeish or roasted malt taste when it first hit the tongue, and the hops and alcohol aren't hidden to well. On the plus side, however, it is a very smooth, thinish drink w/ mixed tart fruits in there. I just think I'll stay with the bottle over the draft though."
"Final Statement: Had better Dogfish Head brews, but this is still a decent beer. Strange, but good."
"Notes: Unique and worth trying once, but nothing to go back to."
"Tastes of a nice assortment of fruits once again but I can notice the raisins more than anything, a heavy dose of sugars and alcohol. I really enjoyed this brew. It is very sweet but it just hit the spot for me."
"D = An interesting beer, it does taste good, but I am not sure that I would rate it too highly in drinkability for the simple reason that I think there are better picks in the style. Would recommend this to anyone who hasn't tried it though."
"D - Not a guzzler by any means. A slow sipper I would say, maybe as an aperitif. Good desert beer."
"Second time through I do not feel that this beer is raw and unrefined. The flavors meld together quite pleasantly actually. It's a pretty good beer, but still lacks some intangible Belgian quality, that I think may be a yeast thing. Will drink again."
"Overall, a decent brew that is drinkable in moderation, but unless you are a fanatic of the style, I dont see this being a session beer or a daily drinker. Its worth a try, and worth picking up every so often, but not something Id keep around."
"I was a huge fan of Dogfish Head's 60 and 90 Minute IPA's, so had high hopes for this unique brew... although it didn't disappoint, I would definitely stick to this company's IPA's, as this was a very odd tasting beer that was too eccentric to be truly enjoyable... decent but wholly unimpressive appearance... ruby-red with minimal head... smell was very malty, full of caramel, dark sugars, spices, brandy, rum, and raisins... all the flavors listed in the aroma strongly complemented the taste, which was different, but dominated by alcohol-like solvents which almost seemed artificial and unnatural... good mouthfeel, but average drinkability... would not want to make this my single choice all nite, but definitely worth a try..."
"Into my new Dogfish Head glass, courtesy of drseamus, pours a ruby mahogany, an inch head gives way to a nice film, some bubblies, and decent lacing. The aroma is rich with candied sugars, some sweet fruity malt oozes forth and has some warmth to it. The taste is good, but hard to describe. I suppose one could say its Belgian-ish. There is malt and spices and warm alcohol to be sure, but I can't quite name any of it, something like toffee, something vaguely like raisins... There is some nice taste to it, but it just is a bit too perplexing. Moderate carbonation and a medium body, its quite drinkable, utterly confusing, pretty much unique. I'm still scratching my head."
"It's a good beer, will definitely buy again, unless I find a new Raison ale to try. A reddish amber in color, or mahogany as they call it, with a eggnog colored head. A lot of pit fruit going on as you could imagine. Very malty, a nice well balanced Belgian style ale."
"I was a little let down by this beer. It is decent, but not something I'd would want to shell out that much money for often. I think there are better strong ales out there that are just as unique, but also more satisfying."
"D - Quite an interesting and unique brew. I wouldn't necessarily drink this in mass quantities. It's definitely an ""in the mood for"" beer. But leave it to DFH to come up with this one!"
"D= although one or two of these should be very drinkable if you're in the mood, I think it's also a bit of a special-moment beer worthy of savoring in small quantity. Plus, at the 8%ABV I think it would be more than most would want in great quantity. This stuff really does have a reputation for catching up with you in hasty surprise!"
"Overall, a pretty good Belgian that I could see myself drinking a lot of and possibly picking up to share with friends. Seems in a way to be a bit of a starter Belgian for those who don't drink the style too much. It is not overly complex not overly simple but a nice standard example of what the style can be."
"D: A decent beer. Highly drinkable  no. Not many Dogfish Head brews are. Is this a good beer, yes. Complex and interesting."
"The beer actually poured a lot darker than most of the style but smelled and tasted very similar. I just can't get into the style. I have a Raison D Extra that I will probably be getting rid of."
"D - A good beer not a great beer but overall a good beer to relax with if you like DFH beer this is worth a try"
"Pours a dark and clear brown with ruby tones. Head is crème colored. Nose is basically nothing. I know I should be getting some raisin there, but I am not getting anything. Flavor is smooth raisins that are not overly powerful. Firm malty tones with what seems like mild hop character. Feel is very smooth on the liquid and with a pretty smooth bubble. Definitely drinkable. Smooth and even, it could easily be a session brew if the sweet tones don't bother you."
"This beer pours a deep brown/red mahogany. The nose is basically non-existent. But what there is of it is crisp cold malt. The first taste is very dark fruitish raisins and candy sugars. Clean finish but doesnt linger very long. the mouthfeel is very thin but thick enough. a bit of copper flavor on the aftertaste. The drinkability is very high. good beer. mediocre by belgian standards, but very very drinkable. a great belgian style for session drinking."
"D - Great beer. It's beers like this that make DFH one of my favorite breweries."
"Full bodied but not thick. The dark sugars and slightly grape flavors blend well with a malty dryness. Very smooth and not bitter-unless one is made aware that this is a 8% abv they'd never have an idea. It's a proverbial iron fist in a velvet glove story. As it warms in the glass it takes on more of a spiced wine taste but still holds a distinct character. It finishes with a creamy and caramel like flavor. I wouldn't suggest it as something when the months get warmer and the days get longer but in the cold times were in right now, this is an enjoyable beer to curl up on the couch with the wife, a big quilt and a movie."
"Nice off-centered beer. Unique smell. Malty, and I didn't think it was too sweet. Whole family enjoyed this one. Multiple flavors well rounded together. This one would probably go very well with a variety of exquisite meals. Drank this one at room temperature, and would recommend trying that."
"This beer poured a dark copper with a two-finger light tan head. The smell is sweet and reminds me of raisins and brown sugar. The taste is sweet and fruity, you can definitely tell that they added raisins and sugar I can also detect some other fruit such as plums . There's a tiny bit of alcohol warming that makes for a nice rich mouthfeel. This is a great beer and I can definitely see myself picking it up again sometime in the future."
"Drinkability: Another tasty brew from Dogfish Head. Very well crafted and satisfying."
"Bottled on 9/17/07. Poured into my Maudite tulip. Beautiful mahogany color (just like the label says ;) Foamy, off-white head dissipated into little more than a ring around the glass within seconds. Thin, inconsistent lacing during the tasting. Nose presented with scents of beglian yeast, malt and dark fruit sugars. Flavors consistent with nose. Lively on the tongue initially, with a nice full-bodied mouthfeel at the finish. Very complex brew, although I can't see myself having more than one or two in a sitting."
"I tried this beer a while back before I really got in to beer. I appreciate what DFH has done with this one. They always push the envelope and this one is no different. I like it in moderation, and would advise anyone who likes different beers to definitely try this one."
"D: One of my favourite beers from Dogfish Head, Raison D'Etre is a class act, one of the best American-made Belgians on the market in my opinion. However, since its not distributed here, I can't enjoy it as often as I'd like to."
"All in all, this is a truly great beer, I feel. Delicious, sweet, and awesome looking. I can see this one being enjoyed by the non-beer loving public, it's that tasty."
"Reasonably rich, but strange, different. Not bad, but I might need a few more servings over a few weeks to make up my mind."
"I poured this beer into my tumbler at 50 degrees. I have been looking at this beer for some time and was afraid I would not like, but I was surprised. It has a nice mahoganny color. Lacing and head not that great though. The beer had a bit of a smoky taste and smelled like an old barn. I think I will try again."
"D: A one"
"Fairly drinkable, but i wouldnt have more than 3 or so in a sitting. Recommended beer."
"# 2 on the list of belgians is this one ; pours a clear, dark burgundy color w/ a slight head which dissipates quickly leaving a fairly light coating of indistinguishable lacing in my glass ; a smell of darker roasted munich-type malts and an almost smoky date-like undertone, not any hops noticeable ; a rather thick, sweet malty flavor more reminiscent of a wee heavy, or a bock maybe, than a dryer, more bubbly dark belgian, not a bad thing, a rich fig/raison flavor throughout w/ hint of nutmeg/clove(?) underneath, a good complex flavor, though i'm not sure i can rate it any where near style, it's probably closer to a specialty/spiced beer ; much too thick for what i think is the style , a rich, robust full bodied brew, mod. in carbonation, i like it & hate to rate it so low ; again the thicker, sweeter flavor makes it less drinkable for the style to me..."
"d: not a bad beer from the folks at dogfish -- decent balance and packs more punch than the 8% suggests. worth a try but nothing great"
"D: Not a session beer but one to have when available and to offer to friends who think that a big beer is 16% and black and sludgy. I recommend as a definite try."
"I rated drinkabilty a little low as the alcohol burn was evident to me which makes this more of a sipper for me. I think a few more months of aging on this one and the drinkability would go up.. perhaps i will sit on the other 3 bottles i have for a few months."
"Overall a great beer, i don't feel it s a true belgian style beer as they claim, but thatsnat really a big deal to me. Excellent beer."
"Never again."
"D-At first taste I didn't think too much of this beer, however,it started to grow on me and I ended up loving the smokey sweet aftertaste.Its a pretty big beer but it's so smooth you forget about the 8%.This is my 3rd sampling from DFH,and everyone is so unique and intriguing I will try as many as I can find!"
"Enjoy!!!"
"12 oz bottle into snifter. A: Deep amber brown, the head went down after a couple of minutes, some lacing. S: Raisins, burnt malts, caramel, something vaguely metallic. T: Really thick and sweet up front, the hops are only faint. Lots of malt, caramel, raisins. I'm still tasting something a little metallic... M: Very thick, carbonation a tad high for my taste. D: I really like this beer. It's got a great malt profile, and the finish is really lingering and delicious. I could definitely go through a few of these. The high abv is almost unnoticeable."
"This one is worth a try and will look forward to some more, but not really anything completely out of the ordinary. worth a grab."
"Very tasty, very aromatic, but when I want a Belgian I look for a more true-to form beer. In and of itself, very tasty, however."
"Typical of the Belgian ales I've tried. Ok. No big deal."
"First of all, it is served in a goblet and begins with a light head that quickly fades. Mouthfeel indicated a sweetish malty taste that improves as it sits. As all BAs know, storage, temperature and proper glassware is vital in manipulating the sensory enjoyment of any good beer - particularly Belgian styles. A premier style from a first-class brewer. Reason to be .... indeed!"
"Overall, I like how the flavors come together in this one. It has the distinct fruitiness of a Belgian, which I also enjoy. Although it does ring in at 8%, to me, the alcohol is pretty well hidden. Good job DFH on yet another quality made, fine craft beer."
"This all led to a very long, sweet and well rounded finish. All and all, a most excellent offering from DFH."
"Overall a very good selection...it is a little lighter than other BSDAs and definitely is balanced a little different, but if you come across this beer, grab one or two"
"Nice off brown coloring, with just a bit of head and no lacing. It has a wonderful mahogany scent with hints of spices. Good taste, a nice mixture of spices, along with raisins and mahogany, a nice sweet taste, although a bit too much hint of alcohol. Goes down a little rough, but not horribly so. A very unique beer, its worth a try if you can find it."
"This wasnt anything like I expected. Poured a brownish/red color with small head that dissipated rather quickly. Aroma is fruity and a bit malty. Flavor is fruity. Mouthfeel is great; this beer is as smooth as it gets. This beer hides it alcohol content very well. Good stuff and very unique."
"I'll definitely buy this again. Last night I enjoyed the Chimay Reserve, which is of the same style. I really enjoyed both brews. The Chimay is sweeter and heavier. It's definitely a sipping beer. The Dogfish Head brew is a little easier to drink."
"D: I really like to have many of these, even with the high abv. Nothing deters me from wanting another."
"D - This beer is drinkable, however I wouldn't want to drink more than 1 to 3 in one sitting. When I drank the first one I didn't lik it very much, but that night I had a few various other beers before trying this. I decided to try it again the next night and I had a different opinion. I have a whole case of this stuff (bought in PA) and it will probably last a while. I definitely wouldn't buy an entire case again, but I would pick up six-pack down the road."
"I was not impressed with this beer, and would not repurchase it. That being said, this beer may personally satisfy you, if you enjoy a more in-your-face alcoholic tasting Belgian .Try Unibroue's Trois Pistoles, if you are looking for an exceptionally balanced Begian Strong."
"D: Nice sipper. Alcohol is hidden well for this 8%. The flavors and taste tell you to slow down and enjoy."
"Notes: Probably won't be picking this one up again, but I guess it was worth it to try to work out the palate a bit."
"Bottle poured into a glass. Was sceptical at trying a ""flavored"" beer, but was pleasantly surprised. Nice dark pour into the glass. Very little head. Nice flavors, detected raisins and carmel / toffee, but not too sweet, could drink more than one without getting sick of it. Will order again."
"Another good effort and definitely worth drinking."
"D: A very rich session beer. Nice, bold flavors. Great character. Will definitely return to this one."
"Pours a very deep amber, almost mahogany color, low head retention. Aroma is mainly sugary sweet grape, Taste is also sweet with hints of grape. Solid, but lacks the ""punch"" i was expecting. Hmm... Mouthfeel is fairly decent, a bit syrupy for my tastes. Drinkability is fairly high, it's really sweet, no bitterness to speak of, drinks like a lower abv beer. If i hadn't seen that it was 8%, i wouldn't have guessed"
"I liked it much better this time... now that I've opened up to Belgian styles. 1st review is pretty accurate.. I just like it better, now, lol."
"If this was a beer on its own, it would just be ""okay"" but comparing to what I had one year ago, the fresh beer was much better. Better luck next year."
"The taste is neither bad, nor phenomenal. Packs a big spicy hop note alongside a fruity/sweet, sugary body. Mouthfeel is sharp and semi-viscous with a bitter brandy aftertaste. Crisp & mildly refreshing, too. This beer isn't great, but it's definately drinkable. Say what you will about Dogfish Head, but they sure do make some interesting (and good) brews."
"This beer was good, but not great enough to make a must-have,"
"Raison D'etres 8% ABV makes it an excellent candidate for aging. I plan on purchasing a six pack and consuming at 6 month intervals to see the differences in taste. As a red wine drinker, I feel that Dogfish Head was looking out for my interest. This beer is proof that you pay for good Beer  but well worth it."
"It's good I'm enjoying it. If the mood should strike for a Belgian dark, this is a nice alternative to cracking open an entire 750mL if I don't happen to want that much. That being said, I'll probably have a second one tonight anyway."
"Drinkability is quite average for this beer. I can't see myself desiring another one anytime too soon."
"Really intriguing brew, not like any Belgian Strong Dark Ale I have had before. This needs a new category, like Belgian Brown Ale, since it reminds me of some English brown ales more than any Belgian beer."
"I can't recommend the bottle, but I do recommend trying a glass of this at the bar. Nice"
"Drinkability - This beer was okay. It was way too sweet to me."
"I had hoped for a scaled down taste of the D'extra but alas this was not the case."
"Pours a deep and clear mohogany with two fingers of cream colored head that dies a little slow and laces. Smells of big malt, alcohol and dried fruit. Taste is very complex. Caramel, sweet malt, a little bakers chocolate, alcohol, raisin. Full in the mouth with nice carbonation. Its half session, half sipper. Another interesting offering from Dogfishead."
"D - A full bodied and strong ale w/ great complexity. The best raisin flavored ale I have had and twice as fresh and sweet from the brewpub. I recommend having this on draft, since it seems more dry and less round and malty in the bottle. Not great drinkability, but for the abv, very good."
"Pours a light brown / copper color with an off white head. Aromas of grapes and a sweet malt. In the taste, dry grapes and sweet caramel, weird combo but works well together. A caramel sticky sweet mouthfeel with a dry clean end. It is a big sweetness, personally, I could not have more than one of these, although it is good."
"Appearance and aroma are up there, but this isn't one of the better offerings from Dogfish. The 60- and 90-minute brews are greatly superior. Pours a deep dark amber with ahint of purple. Aroma is fruity and malty, very nice. But taste comes through as cough syrupy. Raisins, wine, apricots can also be sensed, but the syrupy overtone overwhelms."
"D - I could drink one or two of these but the sweetness hits close to my maximum tolerance."
"Drinkability is pretty low on this one. I didn't really want to finish my glass. I'm going to keep the rest of the six pack around for aging, but I probably won't buy this one again."
"A: good beer for its style, just not my favorite style."
"I opened a bottle last night. It was slightly tart. Tonight's bottle is even more tart. It approaches a sour ale. This is not my recollection. This beer is a rich copper color with little head. Sourness is its main voice. It isn't a bad sour but it is a pronounced sour. I wouldn't age it again . I recall it much better fresh. I'll try it again fresh."
"Serving Type: 12oz bottle poured into Red Oak pint glass."
"M - Nice carbonation, enjoyed at 45 degrees with a snifter."
"The drinkability, unfortunately, not so much."
"This beer poured a clear brown with virtually no head. The aroma is malty and sweet  raisons seem to be noticeable after the beer warms. The taste is mostly of malt, caramel and has a candy flavor present. The mouthfeel is full bodied and leaves and oily feel in the mouth. Drinkability  can I have another??"
"Pours a nice, deep reddish brown color, with a nice, creamy head with good retention and some lacing (poured from a bottle into a goblet). This beer has a strong, sweet, initial aroma, mainly consisting of fruit (mostly raisins), alcohol. This beer has a very malty taste to it, it has a fairly smokey taste to it as well. Fairy sweet. Feels fairy heavy in the mouth, with some carbonation. Thick. It's a very interesting beer, and very tasty as well."
"Medium body and smooth mouthfeel. Highly drinkable at 8% ABV. Very tasty but lacks a certain something."
"Quite boozy Even two in a row is too many of these. Also quite sweet. A nice beer to have one of. Probably a waste of money to double up on this one."
"Drinkability: The only detraction of this beer is the over-abundance of carbonation (IMO). Otherwise this is highly drinkable.... I would say.... GREAT for winter-time/Holiday consumption.... I would like to pair this with a bold appetizer like a spicy crab dip or something.... but far be it from me to suggest food pairings.... I'm still a rookie!"
"D- Not too bad, but not as great as I expect from a DFH beer. It might be good as a bit of a desert beer or a change up, but not a regular drink."
"D: Goes down easy and hides the alcohol well, but you must be in the mood for something sweet."
"The Raison is just not that smooth, the low carbonation doesn't cleanse any of the syrupy sweet flavors. I might score these characteristics higher if there wasn't a claim to BSDA..simply using a Belgian yeast strain does not a Strong Dark make. Pass."
"I did enjoy this beer although the alcohol taste was a bit too much. The warmer it got the stronger the alcohol taste got but at the right temperature this beer almost tastes like a true Belgium."
"Overall Impression: Another very interesting beer from Dogfish Head. I would consider this beer more like the red wine of beers. Very complex and chewy. Not a beer I could drink a ton of but very delicious! Give it a try."
"Drinkability: I find it fortuitous that I was allowed to purchase a mere single bottle of this."
"Overall, the brew is just a mess. A pretty mess. A well-made mess. And I'm glad there's folks out there willing to take the risk. I give Dogfish high marks for aspiration. But on this one attempt, they didn't stick the landing."
"Exceptional Belgian style ale. I prefer a lot more hops, but this is the style. They use Belgian beet sugar and green raisins (a take off on the French for ""reason to be"") to raise the ABV to a respectable 8, without a loss of apparent malt intensity.(Unlike AB's rice syrups, that turn Bud into crap.) A beautiful reddish-gold color in the glass, tiny bubbles, but nice carbonation. A must when company comes, if you can part with it. A bargain at $8.99/6pk. Not really my style, but there's a case in my cellar. Excellent!"
"The color roughly lived up to its Mahogany Ale name. Dark reddish-brown with a whispy lacing, barely any head at all. The aroma is not so strong as I expected, the raisin is notable with a spicey touch to the nose. The first taste is pretty heavy, almost syrupy and is similar to some barley wines I've had. I taste a little bit of vanilla and malt in the sweetness but it is most powerful in it's fruit wine-like qualities and it's a little too strong in that way for my tastes. It's quite a mouthful with some interesting tastes going on but I don't think I will sample this again right away."
"I'll make it through one, but will not be having another tonight. At $10 a sixer, I will not be purchasing again. Maybe Frazbri and BrotherFraz2 can come over and help me with the other five."
"Pours a clear brownish with maybe some purple. Smells of raisins and brown sugar with some plum and spice. Not much going on in the head and lacing. Taste is same as the smell with a bit of bitterness in the finish. Mouthfeel got a little syrupy as the beer warmed. All in all a good beer but must be drunk cool, the ABV keeps it from being a quaffer. The syrupy quality keeps it from being a sit back and relax beer. A nice change and that's it. This did not pair well with a pizza!"
"12 ounce green bottle, bottled on 6/5/2006. Served in my Dogfish Head snifter, the beer pours a mahogany/red color with an inch white head which went away very quickly. This is a sweet smelling beer. The first aroma that hit me was raisins, there's also some brown sugar, molasses and caramel. The taste is very malty and sweet, like raisins, figs, brown sugar, caramel, butterscotch and an herbal taste that reminds me of Jägermeister. Finishes with a bittersweet aftertaste. Mouthfeel is medium, with it being a bit syrupy with just the right amount of carbonation. Drinkability is good, the alcohol isn't too noticable but it does hit you after a while. Aging this beer for a year hasn't hurt it at all, it's pretty tasty! Another good brew from DFH."
"Eric"
"Taste is swee-ee-eet. There is nothing bitter about this, be assured of that. There is a bit roasted malt, but it's a background note to all the sugariness surrounding it. Definite candylike flavours, butterscotch-caramel, along with the juicy plum and the raisins I caught in the aroma. Nutty flavours, and a sharp, almost metallic note in the finish. Nothing comes to the forefront, it just seems a bit messy to me. Way too damn cloyingly sweet as well. Mild carbonation in the mouth, extremely heavy body, thick and leaning toward syrupy. Wet and creamy texture. I like dessert, but with less sugar. This is like a store-bought cake with that icing that gives you instant hyper-sugar-rush. No way do I want more than one of these, it'll be a struggle to do that. This may be my least favorite beer that I've drank in this style. Perhaps I'll go make a dentist appointment now..."
"The beer has a nice mahogany and deep red hue to it, and as poured creates a one finger head which dissapates quickly. On the nose are malt, hops, chocolate, and spice. The first taste reveals hints of hops and molasses. The beer had a mild body to it, not overly carbonated, and leaves a nice sweet after taste in your mouth. The beer is pretty drinkable, and a nice warmth settles after a few sips."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: Medium bodied and slightly syrupy. Carbonation is good. At 8%, it's strong and a bit much to session. I couldn't drink more than two in a sitting. Overall, it's a pretty good offering. Worth a try."
"Cheers."
"This ale is a beautiful deep reddish brown and has a thick, fine-bubbled, persistent head. Aroma is strong and hoppy but not overwhelming. Flavor is mainly hoppy, but it has some maltiness and hints of molasses. The sweetness and bitterness balance each other nicely and add up to a very enjoyable beer."
"D-The sweetness becomes cloying after awhile, limiting the drinkability factor. All in all an interesting offering from Dogfish head. I probably would have liked this better in colder weather. I am having a hard time deciding what i think of this beer. It definitely tastes more Belgian style than actually Belgian."
"D- This is very drinkable for its ABV. I would not hesitate to purchase this again. Reccomended for a try. Probably great as a fall/winter beer."
"D - Pretty damn drinkable for such a big beer. A little to sweet and strong to have more than one, but I would get this again if I see it! Went perfectly with a handful of cashews."
"Maybe tastes a bit too herbal, not quite a Belgian, but it's tasty in its way. I think this one needs the right setting; I can't see making it a regular."
"Overall, this is an interesting beer that seems a cross between a Belgian Strong Dark and a Belgian Blond (imagine this beer without its candy sugar induced color). For the most part, this is somewhat of a beer geeks beer that deceptively hides its high abv and should be approached with caution."
"12oz bottle poured into a tulip glass. Pours a dark mahogany brown with an off-white head. The aroma consists of malt, some dark fruits, rum soaked raisens and alcohol. The taste is very imbalanced and is overly boozy which greatly hinders both the taste and drinkability. I definately won't be going back to this one."
"A good looking beer, poured with a cream colored had, 1 1/2 fingers. A cloudy, dark red-brown center, with the edges of the glass looking more like a light amber. Smell had a heavier malt character, with some tangy fruit compliments. The taste was solid, a solid balance of the dark, sweet malts and slight, tingling hops. The taste of raisin was definately apparent, as was some spice. It was well carbonated, which brought out the complexity of the taste and left a pleasant linger. It's definately a beer worth having."
"Thanks to demcorhip for the bottle!"
"Beautiful mahogany color with a good head and lots of fine bubbles. The aroma is malty, with some vegetable notes (not always a good thing, but here it's very pleasant). The flavor is best described as a great everyday amber/dark ale (including caramel notes) but with some raisiny tartness overlaying it all. Like all DFH beers, the mouthfeel is wonderfully full and rounded. Just a ""kiss of the hops"" leaves the palate feeing cleansed. Recommended."
"An ""interesting"" brew that doesn't live up to the hype. Nothing particularly special, other than unusual combo of flavors. Skeptical that mellowing by aging it would help, as it doesn't seem to be worth it, IMO. One of those to try once to have, I suppose, and certainly a slow ""sipper""."
"D- Not an especially drinkable beer, but a decent dessert beer."
"D: This is an interesting beer. Lots of flavor there, but I find it a bit odd I think. We'll see if the next 5 change my mind."
"Drinkablity: very drinkable, very tasty, lively and complex. However the high ABV and complexity does not make it a great session beer."
"The rich flavor and malty sweetness prevent this from being too drinkable. It insists on being savored slowly."
"This beer pours with minimal head and begins to fill the air with a sweet aroma that, so far, I have found common to Dogfish Head brews. The appearance is excellent with a very dark amber pour that look beautiful in the light. The taste is sweet like the aroma and is followed by a slight taste of raisins. The drinkability is moderate due to the sweet nature of this beer. This can fill one's palate completely."
"A decent brew, didn't really knock my socks off or anything, but still good. I could drink it if there was nothing else around and be perfectly happy."
"This beer pours a reddish brown color with a nice thick head. Aroma is thick and malty with a few undercurrents of raisin. Flavor is strong and malty with an aftertaste that tastes almost like a rusty pipe. But, that alone does not diminish the character of this beer. It starts out well intentioned but the aftertaste is a turn off. I know personally that this beer would taste better fresh. I had it a few years ago and did not like it but as with other beers, my tastes have improved somewhat."
"Definitely worth a try, although I can't say I'd ever drink more than one at a time. The sweetness could be a bit overwhelming on a second go round."
"Pours a dark brown with reddish tones and tan head. Smell had a faint sweetness and some mild hop character - nothing special. Taste was mostly raisins and plums, slight sweetness and some burnt flavors. Somewhat syrupy mouthfeel. Not that bad to drink but nothing really special about it. Not really worth the effort to seek out."
"Overall: Drinkable? yes... great? not great... good."
"Tasting reveals a rich raison and plum base and a toffee malt middle. The finish is what makes this one special: crisp, dry, and LONNNGGG lingering. Very nice. The moutfeel is creamy and smooth with that terrific carbonation. Drinkability is impressive for a dubbel-like beer. I always wondered how this one was sold in 6'ers, but I can see why now. I'd have no problem knocking back a half-dozen of these. Reminds me (fondly) of Ommegang's Abbey-style."
"So, maybe I was really harsh on it from the bottle, or maybe I served it too cold, not really sure, but I liked it a lot this time around"
"Poured a wonderful dark amber color with a fine off-white head. Robust aromas of sweet fruit and sweet malt. Flavors are again very sweet upfront with a tangy malt in the background. Fruity with some mild caramel sugar in here as well. Nice mouthfeel and fine carbonation bubbles. Overall, I found this to be an interesting brew but the sweetness got to me after a while, I wouldn't drink many pints of this."
"Definetly a strong ale, after 2 of these its pointless to review since the inebriation takes away some of the taste. Cheers to DFH for another unique beer. I'll stick to my stouts, but not a bad departure for those of us looking for flavor and variety."
"O - One of the reasons this beer suffers in my review is that I'm not a huge fan of raisins. At the same time, I don't hate them or anything. I guess this experiment just showed the answer to a question I had never before asked, ""Would I like raisin flavors in my beer?"" And thanks to DFH for asking these bizarro questions and attempting all of these unique beers. I'm always a fan of boundary-pushers in food/beverage world."
"Overall a decent dark ale and definately worth trying (as are all the brews from Dogfish Head!)"
"that doesn't cause burping"
"Drinkability - I wouldn't put this up near the top of my list of Belgian Strong Dark Ales. There are many more that have a better balance and more complexity."
"Drinkability: Certainly an American take on the style, and a pretty singular one at that. It still doesn't match the intensity of a true Belgian, as this has the sugars but lacks the phenolic qualities and interesting funkiness and complexity that could be brought along with it. That said, a tasty beer and one I like to sample every now and again."
"Mouthfeel is medium, somewhat creamy and very smooth. However after even one, the sweetness and alcohol start to wear down your tastebuds. Overall this is another winner from DFH, but not quite on par with other Belgian dark ales out there."
"Pours a ruby amber into a tulip glass with little to no head on aggressive pour. No lacing to speak of. Aroma is buttered rum, carmel malts, and alcohol. Taste is primarily sugary malts. Strong alcohol presence on finish. Mouthfeel is on the syrupy side. Drinkability is hurt by big alcohol presence. Not a bad beer at all, but nothing I would seek out."
"one kinda grows on you. If your palate is bored try this one!"
"Raison D'etre seems to be a strange brew. Poured a nice color, amberish, decent head, not much lacing. The taste is oddly astringent, while the mouth feel is cloying. That may be why I find this beer to have an unbalanced, almost creepy quality. Hard to finish a bottle. So many better Belgian strong ales to choose from. Not much I can add ..."
"This beer poured a clear reddish amber hue with a thick off-white head that died down pretty quick. Lace in this brew is quite weak, little to none throughout. Smell is of toasted raisins with a bit of fig, very malt-like scent with a subtle hint of alcohol. Taste is malty, with a bit of a hop undertone. A bit of caramel seems to appear with the raisin/fig flavor following up. Carbonation is weak, with a high drinkability for an 8% abv. Unique beer I must say, but Dogfish is known for that. Pick this one up if you enjoy trying something new, definitely worth a try."
"Mouthfeel was rich. Drinkability about average. The sweetness and lack of variety got boring....not a beer I would be tempted to drink 2 of at a session."
"Served in a pint glass on draft at DFH's Gaithersburg restaurant. Appearance was a dark reddish brown with some head. Aroma was complex raisiny/spicy, with Belgian ale yeast evident. Taste reflects the aroma, with the raisin flavor distinctly present along with the Belgian character, balanced toward the sweet side with little hops detectable. Feels a bit heavy on the palate even for a strong Belgian; perhaps an effect of the sweetness. Not a bad beer but not my favorite from this brewer."
"A beautifully colored beer (the label calls it ""deep mahogany""), with a thick off-white head initially but little retention. Shame. Smells magnificent: my first thought is rum raisin. Malt heavy with bits of toffee, dark fruit, and a touch of grassy hops. Layered taste with alcohol notes (though it doesn't taste like 8%), the dried fruit and caramel. It could use a little more bit, in my opinion -- it ends too syrupy. But for the style, it's very drinkable. I could split a six-pack before I realized how loaded I was. A nice take on the Belgian dark by the boys at DFH."
"Very nice brew that is easy to drink. Goes down very nicely with some sharp cheddar and olives."
"Excellent with olives, chicken, and savory flavors."
"I picked this up at the Willamette Market of Choice in Eugene, OR. It was wicked expensive - over $8 for a 12 oz bottle. It poured out a dark red/brown with no head and very little carbonation. It smelled fantastic - I was very much reminded of the smell of a Michigan berry wine - strong and sweet and fruity. The taste was something of a let-down though - it started out bitter and alcoholic - it didn't seem like a beer or a wine but more like a sweet liqueur. Very thick, syrupy, raisin or prune juice taste, with a bitter aftertaste. I found it kind of hard to drink - it was definitely different in both mouthfeel and taste from most other beers I've had."
"Drinkability/Notes - Tastes too much of the alcohol. I feel as if I'm missing something with many other people enjoying this brew. Its unlikely I would give it another try."
"Drinakbility: At first I wasnt sure I liked it, but its a very complex tasting beer and it grew on me. Goes down easily but packs a punch. Goes well by itself on a fall or winter night, but would definitely taste great with prime rib, roast beef, or a roasted turkey (could definitely take the place of a bottle of wine at the dinner table). This is probably one of the most interesting beers that I have tasted so far. Liked it a lot and would definitely buy it again."
"Thanks Todd1 for this...nice pick :)"
"Raison D'etre pours a deep red with a whispy head that fades quickly. Aroma is dark malts and a dry yeastiness. Taste is a dry maltiness, roasted malt is apparent. Flavors of dark fruits and toffee as well. There is a slightly chalky yeast flavor as well as just enough hops to be noticeable. This beer drinks surprisingly easily for 8%, I wouldn't have guessed it was nearly as much."
"Not representative of the style -- has it been mischaracterized on here? And a disappointing offering from the brewery that has blessed us with the sublime 90-Minute IPA. But everyone has their clunkers."
"Drinkability: One maybe two at most. I enjoy splitting one of these with a friend when we transition from one beer to another. The flavor is unique and big enough to follow any beer, yet it does not impede your ability to enjoy the next round. Also, about half a bottle is all I need to enjoy at one time."
"Like I mentioned, a new style for me. But I dig this beer BIG TIME."
"This is a belgian strong dark ale? It's a poor one at that, balance is all off, flavors are lacking and artificial and alcohol is overwhelming and highly conspicious. DFH, this deviates from your norm, you let me down this time; if you want a truly good belgian strong dark ale then buy one from belgian, if you want to kick yourself for buying this and not something else then go with this DFH offering. This beer is well suited as curiostiy and a single try but not much else."
"C'Mon the Hoops !!"
"D - Drinkable, but not the best palate presence. Doesn't live up to the style of ""Belgian Strong Dark Ale."" The sweetness is nice but there isn't much else. This is an average offering from Dogfish, but hey, not every beer from them can be near perfect."
"Drinkability - I really want to like this beer, due to the fact it's so different. Unfortunately, it's just to sweet to drink more than one."
"pours a medium-dark amber color with a small robust head. small sticky patches were left as the serving got lower. smells of grape sweetness and a bit floral. taste was up front malt, a little too sweet for my tastes, grapes and raisins, then a bit sour. just the slightest hint of bitterness at the finish. unfortunately for me the sweetness seems to only intensify as the beer warms, but on the other hand i really can't detect the alcohol. not bad by any means, but i don't think i'll be picking up any more of of this soon."
"Clear copper with a small head. Good lacing. Aroma of caramel malt, Belgian yeast and sweet fruit, although I wouldnt call the fruit raisins specifically. Maybe over-ripe apricots? Taste is sweet and vinous, with caramel malt and candied fruit. Medium body. Alcohol is well hidden. Slightly syrupy texture."
"Drinkability: Despite the high alcohol percent and sweetness I have no trouble drinking quite a few of these beers. This has amazing drinkability for me."
"Transparent brown in the glass, with no head and weak lace. Smells vaguely of toasted malts and dark fruit, but nothing much happening in the nose. The flavor begins with sweet candy sugars, builds rounded raisin and fig fruits, then toasted malt notes. These would be pleasant if a bit dull by themselves, but the beer is finished with a strong and metallic bitter green raisin tang that ultimately ruins the experience. Thin and watery mouth-feel that does not particularly enhance the beer. A creative but failed experiment from Dogfish Head."
"Beer is a mahogany color with little to no head. Nose is sweet, of yeasts and dark fruits. Taste is sweet, very malty, with candied sugar, and dark fruits. Mouthfeel is very smooth, this brew has aged well! Overall drinkability is good. This is a pretty good interpretation of the style and would recommend this to try."
"Overall: Very good, a little different. Lots of fruit and candy sugars make this a sipping ale."
"At this high an ABV, combined with the beer's sweetness, this beer, while tasty is only somewhat drinkable."
"mouthfeel was viscous and quite thick, due to mouthfeel and high alc content drinkability is average, would have several if it wouldn't put me on the floor. overall another interesting beer from dfh."
"T - Lots of dark, malty character with some chocolate and burnt toast notes. Finishes with a bitter alcohol taste, though not in an altogether unappealing way."
"D - Good drinkability. Unique - this beer left me with the feeling that it wanted to be more."
"The beer poured a mohagony color with very little head. Aroma was sour and oaky. Flavor was significantly better than that. The raisins seemed to bring a richness which was supported by light sourness. Mouthfeel was full and rich. Pretty good."
"Had from a bottle at Stone World Bistro, with my Thai Curry Pork Tenderloin. 'Twas a match made in heaven. The beer has a brilliant mahogany color, and pours with a spendid head. Indeed very raisiny, also apparent are suggestions of cognac, plums and cherries. Also present is a slightly odd aftertaste reminiscent of leather. My first Dogfish product, and definitely not my last. Wish I could find more in Los Angeles, but so far I've only found them at Stone and at Father's Office."
"Cheers2Beers"
"D---It was a very tasty offering. I really enjoyed it and highly recommend it."
"Overall, this is an incredible, complex brew. A great offering from Dogfish Head, and one I will be having more often. I'm not sure that I'm to a point where I could drink several of these in one night, but I'm getting there very fast."
"Pours a beautiful brownish-red color with a thin, bubbly head. Has a very appealing sweet malty smell to it. It drinks very easily and has a great malted mouthfeel. The head disappears quickly, and there was virtually no lacing on the glass. The finish is a little sweeter than I normally like, but it has good substance behind it that helps it stand up on its own. I will definitely seek this one out again, and I would recommend you do the same!"
"Overall it is interesting to try. I will not buy this beer again however."
"It feels thick at first, but upon swallowing it's clear that it's actually a bit watery. The apparent thickness, I realized, comes from the density of the alcohol. The pungency makes it feel thicker. I am a huge fan of most DFH brands, but this is not one of my favorites. It's adequate, but essentially a try-one-and-say-you've-had-one beer."
"Overall, if I see this reasonably priced, I will buy again. Really reminded me of red wine and I look forward to pairing this with dinner."
"D - Lacking in taste, smell and body. If the taste was just intensified I would enjoy this beer a lot more...because it does taste good. I would also like to note that the alcohol is very well hidden."
"Pours a fairly clear amber color with a one finger white head that disappears quickly and leaves a little lacing. Aroma is of brown sugar, sweet malt, and fruit. Not a very strong smell. Taste is fruity with some brown sugar notes and the alcohol is noticeable. It tastes good but it is hard to pickup exact flavors. Mouthfeel is a little more thin than I would care for. I am indifferent towards this beer. Its not bad but I do not think I will buy this again."
"This brew gives off aromas of sweet raisins and chocolaty fragrances. I even detect a slight coffee aroma too. It pours with a wet thin head that dissiaptes rather quickly into fine lacing. Just as the aroma, this tastes of chocolate and coffee. I don't detect the taste of the raisins in this brew until it warms up a bit. Overall a brilliant attempt at something unique."
"Good smooth, creamy texture with just the right touch of fizz. Avoids being overly thick and for that, mixed with an ABV of 8%, it is exceptionally drinkable. Not sure what the Bros. had aginast this brew; perhaps DFH has tweaked its recipe since then."
"I really enjoy this brew. I think I might have a new beer to grab when I can't make up my mind. This gets a definite recommendation from me!"
"Notes: While not horrible this is a mystery brew of sorts. There was a nice spiced segement but it becomes an afterthought as this medicinal theme and the covered palate that takes over and bungles it up."
"Drinkability: could drink more than one per session. Alcohol is not too overpowering. Beer seems fairly balanced. I would tend to believe this beer gets better with some age on it. Some time would probably soften some of this beer's harder unrefined edges."
"As the glass contents slowly declined, I thought only one thing could be possibly better than this: the same beer on draft. As I can see many others have reviewed this beer, I hope the draft version is truly great."
"A full inch of head when poured! Beautiful head that sustained for quite a while. Smells of malty sweetness with a bit of hop spice. A musty smell though was prominent- possibly too old? This one was bottled 7-21-06. Taste on the front very nutty- cashews, peanuts. Lots of malt character with a nice splash of hop flavor. Maybe the hops have mellowed a bit. I seem to remember it having more hop bite when I tried this before. Oh, can't forget the caramel sweetness of the malt. Quite good."
"Like I said, I dont like it as much as I once did, but its a pretty solid brew from a brewery that is still on the cutting edge (if only because of their other beers). Recommended."
"Pours a deep red amber color with no head. The Aroma speaks of raisins and malts. The initial taste is sweet but has a slight (not hoppy) bitter bite as an aftertaste. It's pretty solid. This is the first of the six-pack I just bought and I'm glad after finishing this one that I've got five more of these beauties in the fridge. :) Dogfish Head makes some great beers and this one's no exception. Well done."
"I got this beer from the brewery in early June and it has a born on date of mid May. Cellared it for 6 months and it's time to have one. This is a beautiful rich mahogany colored beer with an off white head. I only really detect slight sweet malty aromas from it. This beer hits hard with sweet malt flavors and follows up with raisin aftertastes. For 8% alcohol, it hides the taste well and is incredibly smooth. Overall, this is a medium bodied beer with perhaps a bit too much sweetness, but it is great none the less. I like this beer and I get it often."
"Very nice looking beer, deeply rich & colorful. Smells good, solidly strong Belgian and dark smelling, I guess. Taste is quite good, smooth malty with little to no hoppy character. Good mouthfeel, maybe a little rich/thick/sudsy if that makes any sense. Drinkability is good at best, since this is really a cooler weather beer. All in all not a bad beer to have on hand. I like."
"Heard alot about this brew and finally got to try it. It pours a deep amber color with no head to speak of. Smells wonderfully unique! Interestingly sweet smell. Raisons and malt. Tastes of hops with definite raison and beet influences. Remarkably smooth for 8 %. Quite easy to down a few of these, but the alcohol will sneek up on you. Well done Dogfish head. Next gotta get some Raison d' extra."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- In the mouth, the texture is extraordinary. Right away, it rolls and swirls with ease and grace... laughing in the face of everything harsh and undesirable about the beer thus far. I give DFH credit where it's due... always pushing the limits of what's possible, and staying true to its mission and purpose. I just am really having a hard time with this beer. I finished it though..."
"Thanks for the bottle MuenchenerKindl."
"Pours a dark brown with little head and a tiny bit of lace. Smell is sweet, caramel, and of course the hint of raisen. Taste matches perfectly. Very rich and full flavored. The raisen taste is very nice, but this has a great malty fullness. Not overly carbonated, but it doesn't need to be. Very well rounded and very enjoyable. I am looking forward to more of these."
"pours dark brown with a tint of red one finger tan head that fades fairly quickly and some lacing. bready fruity raisin smell. taste is sweet bready caramel raisin fruity. mouthfeel is medium, buttery smooth with a fine carbonation. really liked this beer hope to enjoy some more real soon."
"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, beer is amber/mahogany in color with no head. Smell is of roasted malt, fruit, and Belgian confectioners sugar; slight metallic smell. The taste is sweet with the Belgian sugar being prominent, a metallic tinge like with the nose. Alcohol not too noticable. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with very little carbonation. Overall, this beer is drinkable but not overly desirable."
"Coming from a wine drinker, this is not a ""winey"" brew. Its roasted character and relatively low sweetness reminds me more of a porter than your typical Belgian. As such, I think it should have broad appeal among beer consumers, and not just among Belgian aficionados. This is definitely not one of Dogfish's extreme brews. As with all other DFH beers I've had, the alcohol is expertly concealed."
"Overall, I don't know. ABV is well hidden. Unique but off putting, interesting but unpleasant, complex and unfriendly, yet shallow and heart warming."
"Give it a shot, take your time with this one."
"Presentation: Packaged in a twelve-ounce brown glass long neck bottle with a pop-off crown, served in a standard pint tap glass."
"Sadly, I have to admit that this comes nowhere close to the 'ultimate' pairing, though. I would suggest having this one on it's own to fully enjoy the more delicte flavours - which are the better part."
"DA: This is a very interesting take on a classic style that's hard to beat. The flavors are all over the map from roasty to classically DFH sweet. The Feel wasn't as clean and pure as some of the best BSDA's but not bad."
"Overall: Wow. I am happy to have finally had the chance to have this beer. I got in at O'Brien's. I will be back later this week to get some more before they run out."
"Thanks to MuenchenerKindl for the great selection of DFH brews."
"This beer wasn't bad, a hint of raisins in the back round with some caramelized malts. Nicely complex and balanced. very interesting and a little different. Has decent head and retention. Has a nice smell, but it's faint. Mouthfeel is nice and crisp, but could be a little bit thicker. This beer is easy to drink, but I don't think I'd make a sessionout of it. It's ok to have a couple of though. this is the most popular dogfish beer in lubbock, but it's no where near my favorite of their brews."
"Deep toffee in color, not much of a head, mainly a cream colored ring. The aroma is of raisins, molasses, grapes, and other fruits. The flavor is exceptionally fruity, but it takes a while for this to be completely apparent. At first is seems like a brown sugar/molasses, with dark fruits type beer, and it is. But as it warms, and as you have more than one or two, more and more flavors become noticeable, red and white grapes, plums, dates, figs. This beer remains sweet with the Belgian beet suger always there, but the darker fruit flavors, and some hops keep it pretty balanced as well. It's kind of a sugary sweet dry mouthfeel, but not quite cloying. This beer is really easy to drink, it does not seem like it is 8% what so ever."
"Drinkability - this is good, but not great. Also, high abv limits sessionabilty."
"Overall I found this beer to be enjoyable if a bit sweet."
"This is a very flavorful, high ABV beer in which the alcohol is not entirely hidden, though somehow it is fairly drinkable."
"Poured into a pint glass, has a reddish color that that leaves not much head, but the head is there. Smell is of a sweet raison with malt hints and also figs in there as well. The taste to me is awesome has that strong bite that I like it is very sweet to the tongue and goes well, I can drink and drink and drink one after another, very flavorful and for it being a strong ale one that I can have all night. The reviews on this beer is to low for my liking this is one awesome crafted beer and probably the best belgian american style in imo, truly awesome 2 thumbs up dogfish head keep them flowing."
"GET MY BUZZ ON-n"
"Just for shits and grins, I followed this with a 2 year old (at least) bottle, notched 6 on the neck. The scores are for the fresh bottle. Appearence is the same as the fresh, but that's it. The smell is much stronger - you pick up the raisons in a bit of a spatlese bouquet. The taste also exhibits more of the raison/spatlese taste, but unfortunately the bitterness has been enhanced to almost an unshakeable sourness that is not at all pleasant. Mouthfeel and drinkability are also different. No trace of carbonation at all - very smooth and more like a port wine or a brandy. This is the second Dogfish I have aged over 2 years, the other being an Immort Ale. Both have taken on this smoother, more brandy like taste and texture. If the sourness were absent, I would say that I prefer this one aged just for the other qualities it seems to bring out."
"Had this brew on staff recommendation at the brewery- very attractive deep red-amber pour and a malty sweet aroma. Fine carbonation on the tongue, with a very dry, very malty sweetness with just a hint of alcohol. Finishes with a pronounced dried fruit on the back and sides of the tongue. Definately complex in its character, but has its limits with regards to drinkability- stick to this as an after dinner dessert beer and stay happy."
"Bought as a single bottle from Keag Market. Pours a ruby dark brown with a nice light brown head. Very strong sweet malt smell. Tastes quite sweet, a bit like dried fruits and malt, little bit of alcohol in the background. Good mouthfeel. Over it reminded me of Sam Adams Double Bock, but not as sweet. It's good but probably would only have it if offered by somebody."
"M-Is very Carbonated"
"The beer mellowed nicely,still just a bit rough,a little filling.One beer at a time here. A sipping beer for dessert."
"An interesting beer. I think I had more fun trying out the more-than-twice-as-strong Raison D'extra"
"A pretty decent beer from DFH IMO."
"Has a sweet very malty/woody smell to it. The alcohol is hidden very nicely behind the maltiness on this beer. The taste of the raisons is ever so slight on this beer, but it is there. I would have to say it is well balanced with a nice sweet finish that lasts a while. It really sits well on the tongue. I could drink a few of these. I don't normally go for this style of beer but I really like this one and would recommend it."
"A deep mahogony color w/ some amber & brown tones. Small tan head that disappeared quickly. I can smell some wood and floral scents w/ a faint sweet smell. Slightly sweet, I can taste the rasin in it, also some wood tones. Slightly carbonated, creamy. Not bad."
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. Little head appeared. Not much lace either. The smell was fruity. The mouthfeel was below the rest of the beer, but still better than average. Not as strong as a typical 8% ABV. Very drinkable. Great beer. Don't drink and review."
"I really enjoy this beer. I keep going back for more. It's almost an after dinner beer, and it's rather on the heavy side  it's just massive on several dimensions. It's a deep woody brown clear beer with a foamy head that has not much retention due to its high alcohol content. There is quite a lot in the smell and it's sweet and molassesy and thick smelling. There are spicy, cherry, nutty and caramelly notes in the nose. It tastes all at once toffee and bready and raisinesque with spicy hop notes throughout. This is a BIG beer. The finish is note as long and bitter as one might expect from such a huge beer and I suspect it's partially due to its serious sugar levels; it's just a very sugary finish leaving a candied sticky taste (but not a bad one) on the palate. I find this beer does well at 45 degrees as suggested but is also really great at 60 degrees. The mouthfeel is full and expansive and sticky. The drinkability is superb considering how high in alcohol it is. I just want to have another whenever I have this beer."
"This stuff is made for kings. It made my mouth so happy I can not explain. It smelled sweet, had complex malt flavors, and a strong presence of alcohol. Afterwards, it leaves a rich and creamy yet dry feeling in your mouth. Great sipping beer, give it a shot."
"Served chilled in a pint glass. A little bit too cold for my liking. Poured a deep mohaogany (stolen from the bottle), with little head that dissipated rather quickly. No lacing. Smelled faintly of alcohol, grapes, and brown sugar. Tasted of grapes, wood, sugar with a sweet beginning and a tart , dry wine like finish. Pretty decent brew but i prefer the 'Extra."
"pours amber brown. little head. smells sweet with malt and carmel aromas. the taste reflects the aroma quite nicely. for the abv very little ethanol flavors detected. good mouth feel, low carb with a medium body. Overall a good brew. Can be sweet so watch what follows!"
"This beer poured a mahogany body with such a weak head the it faded into nothing very quickly. The aroma of the beer was very sweet with a dried fruit hints coming throught. The taste was sugary sweet with a raisiny taste. The taste was also malty with a sugary sweetness to it. The mouthfeel was lingering dry finish with no real alcohol notes I could detect. This was a slow drinking beer due to the complex tastes. It was an interesting beer that didn't leave me wanting another."
"Slainte!"
"pours a clear, dark amber color with almost no head. Leaves very little lacing. Aroma is of dark sweet fruit and a hint of coffee. Taste starts out almost sugary sweet and is followed by roasted malts, sweet fruit (raisin) and some alcohol. Seems a little thin and watery, but that may be due to the fact that I just had a DFH 90min. and this just seems thin compared to it."
"d - very easy to drink, alcohol is well-hidden. overall it is very good but at the price and with dogfish's rep and my previous experience with them, i was expecting more."
"Drinkability: Goes down surprisingly well for the alcohol content. As another reviewer put it, this is definitely an ""off-centred ale."" I kind of wish I'd gotten a single instead of a sixer, though."
"8% ABV? Sleeping beauty!"
"This would be absolutely perfect on a cold fall or winter night."
"Appearance is a brownish red. Head dissipates quickly. Smell is a muted malty sweetness. Taste is slightly better than the smell. Malt is the dominant flavor. Can taste the dark/dried fruits a little bit. Overall disappointed in this one. This was one of my first craft beers about 3 years ago and I remember being impressed. I guess as I have tasted and experienced more I have moved past this. Mouthfeel is slightly thin - no richness in it. Drinkability is slightly above average because the alcohol is hidden pretty well. Taste isnt bad but is lacking. Pretty surprising because DFH beers tend to be very good."
"Poured into a goblet...poured a nice redish amber color, small head that dissappeared quickly. The smell was like a beligum ale, but with lighter hint of fruit. The taste was malty, with a smooth 1st taste. I like most of dogfish's beers, but ive had a lot better beligum ales before."
"This beer had its high points, but they were overtaken by phenolic aromas and flavors. I wasn't that impressed with this one. However, it may pair well with getting hit in the mouth by a fresh New England snowball."
"Everytime I have this beer, its a different beast altogether. I went from loving it to hating it, and now I just feel that it's pretty decent."
"I had a Trappistes Rochefort 8 a couple days ago, and I am not certain of the age of this beer, but it tasted like a younger, more crisp Belgian beer."
"I guess I expected a little more body from Dogfish, but it is still a respectible ale."
"12oz bottled two months previously purchased from Best Cellars in Boston. Pours brown with virtually zero head. Not entirely pleasing scent of molasses. First taste: hmmmm... not entirely pleasing taste of molasses. The flavour is not as complex or interesting as I was hoping. Rather sweet. Getting a bit better as the beer goes on. Long finish. Not one that I'll try again, but not my normal beer style anyway."
"Pours dark amber with creamy off white head which recedes to a thin film. Aroma is winey and roasty. Taste is roasted malts, raisins (that's a surprise) and alcohol. The alcohol is prominant, but not out of balance, this beer has lots of flavor. Mouthfeel is slightly on the thin side of medium. Lots of complex flavors in this one, kind of reminiscent of a Belgian. If not for the price, I would drink this one more often."
"Drinkability: I think the alcohol level and syrupy sweetness of this combine to make it a one drink limit. I couldn't imagine a night of these."
"The smell is very deep and pleasing. Raison and fig come through strong. Dark malt and dark fruits add in to the taste. The mouthfeel is medium and pleasing, while drinkability is very good for the alcohol content."
"Pours deep amber, very nice orange hue. Not much head, but some lacing.Smell is of dates, and figs, with a hint of rum rasin. Body is on the thin side, with some carbionation. Taste is lighter than I expected. Sweet fruits, and rum, with a nice smooth finish."
"Very drinkable, hard to put this one down. Very unique, and another DFH classic."
"All in all, it is a pretty decent beer but not worth the 13 dollar pricetag for the 6-pack."
"This is a very drinkable beer. I've been waiting for this beer to hit my local beer store forever now and low and behold its here...finally. Buy it."
"Certainly nowhere near as drinkable as swill type brew. This is a rich, decadent, and satisfying brew, and it would be very easy to tip a few back, enjoying the complexity and interplay between the components of this brew. This is something ill pick up again from time to time."
"I'm writing this as I drink the beer, actually. This one seems quite good. It is a beautiful drink to behold, dark red with a cream- colored head. Decent lacing has been present till now, about two-thirds of the way through. The nose has a lot of figs and pecan pie, but you have to really dig your nose in the glass to find out. Taste starts of with the figs, along with some raisins, leather, and cigars; then moves to a very delicate oaky scotch with a pruney finish. Light carbonation helps this brew out signifigantly. I will be picking this one up again, mostly because I like the flavor combinations, rather than a particular complexity."
"The taste doesn't reflect the creative description above, but still this is an interesting and delicious offering from the Dogfish people."
"Pours a dark orangish brown with caramel highlights and good clarity. Creamy off-white head barely reaches one finger and shows lacking retention leaving scarce spotty lacing. Phenolic notes of raisins and a rose alcohol aroma. Taste is very sweet upfront; roasted barley and toasted crystal with a tart, phenolic plum flavor. Dry aftertaste with a mild alcohol bite, some english hop bitterness and raisin sweetness. Just slightly crisp low-medium carbonation accentuates the alcohol snap in a silky medium-full body . The finish is residual and slightly boozey, but fades quickly enough for a decent drinkability. The alcohol does however meld with the hops to balance the sugary/tart flavors wonderfully."
"Pours light brownish amber with little lacing. Smells strong of alcohol and fruit especially grapes (suppose derived from the raisens?) Also nutty aromas as well. Tastes much of the same, sweet and dry. Good but couldn't figure out how it won best American beer of 2001 (didn't check who awarded the beer but might not have been a very big deal). Overall solid."
"The saving grace for this beer's ook is its cool mahagony, merlot highlight, nut brown color. Some small length bubbles about an inch long from start to top. A little alcohol greets the nose with a liquer like raisin and prune aroma. A light gariny malt mixes with the dark yet very sweet fruits and a splash of alcohol for good measure to remind you of the liquer aroma. Clean palate but a little hot."
"Opinion: This is a pretty good beer. It isn't my favorite as it is so sweet that it is a bit cloying. Dogfish is definitely extreme as this is the malt counterpart to their hoppy DFH90. I respect a brewery that tries to make more than one type of beer. I would drink this beer again, but I probably won't be buying it very often."
"I had to drink 4 of these (on seperate nights of course) to really decide what I thought about this beer, but I think that overall it's a pretty solid beer. Not an everyday beer but worth trying and pretty good."
"Mouthfeel was heavy and syrupy."
"Highly recommended brew."
"Green raisins and dry fruit make this a very good and drinkable selection from Dogfish Head. I would recommend this to wine drinkers who don't usually drink beer - I shared it with my in-laws-to-be and they really enjoyed it."
"underwhelming and even disappointing for a brew produced with interesting ingredients. not terrible but there is no direction and the mouthfeel is lacking."
"Overall: A decent, but not great attempt at a Belgian Strong Dark. The aromas could be stronger and more vigorous carbonation would do quite a bit for the appearance and mouthfeel. The taste is good, though perhaps overly sweet without enough spice and bitterness to balance."
"And while this beer is classified as a Belgian strong dark ale, I didn't feel there was a flavor profile that made this beer patently Belgian. It certainly didn't have the signature Belgian fruity esters. To me it tasted like a blend of a Scotch ale and a Belgian dark, but that is in no way a criticism. Dogfish Head has made a business of breaking the mold when it comes to beer and this is simply an excellent beer that stands without the pretense of stylistic categorization."
"Served in a goblet at 54 degrees. Poured pretty hard, and the head flared up brief, light brown, and disappated almost immediately. Alcohol comes through strong in the nose and taste, masking any hop aroma. Malty taste, carmel notes. Beautiful shimmering ruby highlights at the edge of the glass. Overall a very good beer that I'd order up in a heartbeat."
"EDIT: It is also worthy of mention that I had poured this into a crystal goblet prior to consumption, and did not drink it directly from the bottle."
"Had a lot of doubts about this one going in, and was pleasently surprised by how much I loved it. A great brew."
"First of all, this guy has one of the best colors I have ever seen, a very dark amber with very little head. The smell really gives away the taste, a mouthful is certainly no surprise after taking a whiff. Very strong malty, musky caramel, with a vanilla aftertaste. The hops are definitely present and linger long on the tongue. A pleasant level of carbonation, but a little thick, which hurts the drinkability a bit."
"Thanks for the bottle Jonathan."
"To be honest, I'm not crazy about this beer even though I know it is award winning. Too heavy on the sweet side for me. I'm sure I'll give it a go again, but it is definitely of the one beer an outing variety."
"Overall: Not bad, but not my favorite. Seems a bit subdued. Give it a try."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable. However, I can't see myself drinking a multitude of these in one session. They're too sweet for that. However, I could really see enjoying one of these after dinner or while reading a good book."
"Pours a clear, dark mahogany color as its description implies. About a half inch of head is formed after an aggressive pour, staying around. Aromas are rich, chocolaty, sweet, oaky and vanilla. Flavor is almost stout like in texture and sweetness. Moderate carbonation floats heavy roasted flavors, sweet maltiness mingles with minimal hopping. An enjoyable beer, distinct for sure, but lacking a bit of complexity with an overall cloying sweetness surrounding it."
"Pours dark orange/amber with a nice lace. Smells of raisins and molasses. Tastes big but smooth with definite flavor of raisins and malt.The combination of flavors is reminiscent of a stone beer with its carmelised tastes. Rich and mouth coating, almost syrupy. Not my favorite in the Dogfish line, but very interesting."
"mf/d- The feel is moderate and slick. Despite the weirdness it isn't too offensive. I suppose I could have a few but this beer lacks a sense of purpose."
"I've yet to be disapointed with DFH... I really feel that thier line up is hard to beat. Also, you have to respect a beer this innovative...there is simply nothing else like it out there."
"Part of a Boom box case that I purchased over the weekend and enjoyed while tailgating at a DMB concert for my birthday. What a time. The beer poured a redish bronze color with a nice off white head and good lacing. The aroma had some interesting fruit notes (raisins) and malts and belgian yeast that made for a perfect bouquet. The taste was a pleasant balance of the malty caramel character and the definitely present belgian yeast that makes for a very drinkable representation of this style."
"I like it a lot."
"This is certainly a drinkable beer but I really expected more from DFH. The flavor is just too mild for my tastes."
"D - very tasty beer, if you like dark Belgian styles, definitely one to pick up and try. Despite alcohol content, I could drink a few of these in a night, no problem. Used to buy this beer by the case. Another fine offering from DFH."
"Very slick and lingering in the mouth, the Belgium sugar candy turns into maple syrup at times. Again, a slow sipper."
"Drinks easy for the strength, dut doesn't quite pull together for me"
"All around, it's a damn nice beer with a good easy finish!"
"Notes: Frankly, for the price, I prefer the Ommegang, which also happens to be more easily available in my region."
"I'd say give it a try, it ain't too shabby, just not particularly as full-bodied as I'd expected."
"Mouthfeel is decent, medium bodied. Not much carbonation. Drinkability suffers from the twang and the hint of alcohol in the flavor, it makes this one a bit rough around the edges. A bit too sweet to have more than one. Good and I'd have another at some point...just not tonight."
"After a half-dozen sips I figured I'd wait for some other time to try another bottle before reviewing it, but I'm not sure I want to drink another. I don't know where they're going with this stuff. I was so powerfully repelled that I feel like I have to give it another shot, but it will be a while."
"Honestly the last color I'd expect this beer to be was red, but it works. A nice dark red tint with a fleeting head that spottily covers the top and loads of beautiful bubbles streaming upwards. Smell is of cherries and syrupy chocolate with a bit of yeast thrown in for good measure. Overall though it's kind of medicinal. Taste is along the same lines except richer and more balanced. Cocoa seems to round out this one with dark malts and a faint hint of cherry tartness mixed with a dulling raisin character. Balanced in the mouth and avoids being overly think/syrupy while retaining the high abv. Another offering from DFH that manages to completely alienate the diabetics."
"Dogfish Head makes some amazing brews, and this is definitely one of them. Try one of these for a unique experience."
"The 8% ABV is masked well by the complex flavors present in this beer. I would recommend trying this to anyone who is a big fan of unique craft beers; but probably not the best for those of you who still insist on Miller Lite when bellying up to the bar. All in all though, another fantastic achievement by the Dogfish guys. Salute!"
"MK"
"Overall, this one is just over sweetened for my likings."
"Is an okay beer. Would be more drinkable and tasty with a little more fiz."
"Very drinkable! A real surprise. I expected a heavier beer. I ordered it on name alone--Dogfish Head. I'm glad I did. I will go back for more."
"Mouth: The beer enters with sharp carbonation that melts into a great creaminess on its way back, but still manages to keep some sparkle to tickle under the tongue and on the roof of the mouth. Very sweet, toffee like malts and grape juice flavors. Has a slight presence of plastic in the swallow, but even this is hardly disagreeable. It's very complex and fruity - beyond just grapes. It reminds me of a barley wine, and finishes with a vanilla/banana tainted alcoholic warmth on the exhale."
"Dogfish Head Raison D'etre pours a mahogany brown with a fluffy light brown head from a brown twelve ounce bottle. The smell is on the sweet side, with alcohol being noticeable. Flavor is estery at first, with alcohol and raisons being next up. The finish is kind of malty. Some burn from the alcohol is noticeable after the finish. Well it's different, not really my thing. Worth a try, but really didn't do it for me."
"Dark cream colored head, that doesn't last. no lace. aroma malty with some other sweetness noticed. Different flavors hit you at once. a bitterness that isn't typical hoppyness. slight alcohol feeling in the back of throat. very different tasting. Has some Belgian influences, but more fruitiness."
"All in all not a bad beer to kick around with, have with a burger, but nowhere near as good as it was when I was newer to the craft brew scene and not the ""best beer in america"" as it claims on the six pack carton."
"D - More easily quaffable than the traditional examples of the style. Would pair well with and/or adapt to many different dishes."
"bought just a single bottle because i'd heard bad things about this beer and i didn't want to waste my money. but after having tried it, i can say that i thought it was quite tasty and worth my money after all. there's a lot of malty, choco-qualities in it and while i didnt really taste raisens, i did get some sort of sweet fruit taste that was nice. a very hearty, tasty beer that i can't find anything to really complain about."
"Keep on the lookout for its big brother, D'Extra, on draft which is not to be missed."
"Drinkability - Its tasty but I don't think I could have more than one in any one sitting. Its high ABV% and high carbonation made it difficult to really thoroughly enjoy. There is also a burnt coffee note that lingers a little too long on the palate"
"Deep mahogony color. Head falls to a thin ring around the glass. Smell of some dark fruits and some heavy dark malts. First impression when i take a drink is a crisp bite right up front. The taste that follows is an earthy taste. Alcohol gives a little warming sensation on the finish. I'm kind of on the fence on this one. A nice beer that i could see enjoying on occasion but not as a regular."
"Poured a deep mahogany from a 12 oz dated bottle. Had a litte bit of head and some carbonation. Didn't have as strong a smell as expected since 8% - actually seemed a little weak. The taste however did have a bit. I'm not real big on the high alcohol beers so this one only gets an OK rating. Good for getting a quick buzz but won't be searching it out. Worth a try just to say you had but buy 1 not a 6-pack. (2, NA, ML, N)"
"In my opinion this is not a Belgian Dark, but instead would more comfortably fit under the Old Ale category. However, that doesn't mean it's not an exceptional beer. Very tasty and interesting."
"D - high, this brew is balanced, smooth, palatable, a fine brew"
"I could drink this all night, really well done beer."
"mouthfeel is a littel thick"
"Bought sometime in early fall 2005 (likely in september): Pours a slightly murky deep amber color with a thin tan head that retains well. The aroma is intensely malty with notes of caramel, grapes, candy sugar, toasted bread, belgian yeast, floral and mineraly hops and some slight ethanol. The flavor starts off with sweet notes of caramel and maple syrup, along with grape, fig and plum fruit flavors, belgian yeast, candy sugar, floral and herbal hops, toffee and honey. Mouthfeel is medium light with light carbonation; drinkability is good. When i first tried this beer fresh i was not particularly impressed, but with 7-8 months a transformation has ocurred. This beer has become a good to great belgian style beer, off-dry but complex and delicious."
"This beer poured a clear reddish brown with a small head that went away rather quickly. Aroma was malty and slightly fruity, but other than that, not much smell wafting from the glass. Taste was malty and sweet with some flavors of dark fruit, syrup and caramel and a touch of hop bitterness. As the beer warmed I noticed it had thin mouthfeel and became too sweet. Overall, a pretty boring representation of a Strong Belgian Dark and a major disappointment from a brewer where much more was expected."
"drinkability: pretty drinkable"
"Watch out"
"Another good beer from Dogfish Head."
"I appreciate the uniqueness of this ale, but I've had about 4 or 5 in the past couple years and they always impress something different upon me each time. So I guess you could call this one elusive and/or complex. Still haven't put my finger on it. Would love to try this fresh from the brewery or on-tap, as a matter of comparison."
"Pours a deep mahogany, just like the label states. Good, thich head with very small bubbles. Aroma had a mineral undertone. Tasted somewhat brandy-like with the mineral undertone as the aroma did. Wasn't much of a fan at first. Thinking that I had it too cold, I let it sit for a while which helped a lot. Still not the most impressive from DFH I've had, but still a good brew."
" I don't love this beer but I could see giving it a shot for a sixer in a pinch but not something I'll hunt for again."
"Definitely worth a try, and I appreciate the inherant adventuresome quality of Dogfish Head. However, I just do not think that the more adventurous path sought really paid off in this case."
"Dark-brown mahogany color, clear with a small head. Malty, caramel, dark-fruit aroma. Strong malt backbone, with notes of caramel and light chocolate, along with quite strong dark-fruit flavors, ripe plum and grapes. Low-moderate hop-presence balancing out things, making for a warming but clean finish."
"For me this was average for its style. Worth drinking, but not exceptional."
"Very well done. Sweet and to the point, but does not mask the alcohol as well as other Belgians. But the extra kick is characteristic of Dogfish Head, and is not necessarily a bad thing."
"I enjoyed dfh's India brown ale and I also enjoy this beer. I continue to be impressed by the quality of products DFH produces."
"Would I have another? Certainly."
"D - Alcohol is too present and taste is not interesting or complex enough to drink several of these."
"No hop in the aroma, but you can smell the raisins and the malt. Like others, that first sip caught me off guard. A little harsher than I had hoped. I was looking more at some of the smoother Belgian ales. It did get better as it warmed. I think it may have needed more of a snifter for serving, or a tulip. Probably won't get it again, but the object is to try as many different kinds as possible."
"This beer poured with a decent head that disapeared quickly. The color is a nice mahogony. The smell is semi-sweet with some fruity notes. The taste is a little fruity with some hint of caramel. The mouthfeel is fairly smooth. I could drink this again but I do not think it could be sessioned. A strange brew that I can't really compare to anything."
"This is a interesting and easy-to-drink brew for something so strong. I'm going to try and cellar a bottle or two to see what happens in the next few months. Perhaps age will impart the dryer body that this beer needs to go from good to great."
"From a DFH ""Boom Box"" purchased in Waynesboro, PA. Glowing burnt sienna/copper; the thinnest of carbonation induced foam rings the circumference of the oversized wine goblet. Aroma is mostly sweet booziness -- dates and dried figs soaked in rum, but mostly just a vapor of alcohol. Prickly sweet alcohol flavors at first; cherries, prunes, and date sugar sweetness. A vanilla-marshmallow taste is also detectable. The finish is a pleasant toasty malt flavor -- unexpected and appreciated. Mouthfeel is definitely the strong point here: full, expansive, briefly fluffy, then chewy, and overall, at once both effervescent and smooth. Such a complex mouthfeel is always a high point for me. Not always in the mood for such a sweet beer, but this is a nice one."
"Not what I expected, but I'm not complaining. If I have one complaint, it's that the alcohol is pretty obvious. What I like about this beer is the creaminess, and the stickiness of my lips that results from drinking it. I'm a sucker for stuff like this."
"-SS"
"Comments: I thoroughly enjoyed this ale. Really wonderful aroma & flavor. Excellent beer for those times you are looking for something to sip slowly rather than for thirst quenching. The care that went into the presentation of aroma & flavor deserves to be savored...."
"Raison D'etre pours a clear deep red with a thick tan head. Aroma is molasses, sour fruit and malt. Taste is more of the same, with some spicy clove notes and an off-dry hoppy slightly hot alcoholic finish. Fairly carbonated. Would be a bit more drinkable if it hid the alcohol a bit better. A tasty and unique brew."
"D - I will be having more of this beer when I can get it. One is not enough."
"12 ounce bottle pours a clear dark amber under a very thin but solid light tan head. Smell is light vinous with malt, brown sugar, grapes and lots of figs. In fact, this smells like a fig newton bar, cookie wrapping and all. Taste is sweet malt and red wine, with cracked pepper on figs. Hops are not there until the aftertaste. Fizzy alcohol warmth in the mouth, with a sticky roundness. I like it. This is not quite a ""sipper," but not one to drink very fast: the flavors round out as the beer warms in the glass. Definitely worth the $1.99 at Liquor Max, and thanks to Nick (""Crosling""), the beer side manager there, for the recommendation."
"pours out a dark brown\red beer with little head that dissipates quickly.Has a sweet coconutty type smell. Taste is sweet that turns a bit tart,,no hops to speak of and a taste i cant figure out. Alcohol taste is present but isnt too overbearing.Mouthfeel isnt bad,,drinkability is low i couldnt deal with a few of these in a row."
"Mouthfeel/drinkability: On my last beer run out of state I bought this blind. I had only had a couple dogfish beers, and I ended up bringing four back. I am really impressed. The beer is extremely drinkable(if you dig malty beers). Watch out for the alcohol it might catch up on you being that it is 8%"
"Sweet smells of butterscotch and spices dominate the first whiff. The taste is a malt dominated sugary sweet rush with hints of the aformentioned butterscotch as well as an interesting banana/raisin finish. This reminds me of an incredibly toned down version of Sam Adams Utopia. I repeat, this is not like the Utopia, but some of the flavors do bring back memories of it. Difficult to detect any hops, which dissapoints me, but overall a good tasting brew here. Carries a medium mouthfeel that goes down easy."
"It's not undrinkable, but there doesn't seem to be that sense of purpose that DFH mentions on the label. I suppose if you wanted an all sweet strong dark Belgian, then this fills that purpose, but few others. Grab a Unibroue instead."
"Dark amber/copper in color, slim head, no retention. Subtle nose of raisin, cherry, caramel, slight alcohol. Malt flavor is lightly sweet, with notes of raisin and caramel. The taste is slightly dry and nutty with a bit of a spiced alcoholic finish. Medium thick, decent carbonation, fair smoothness. Drinkablity is nice, the sweetness is subdued making a nice balance from the spiciness. Alcohol flavor is present but I don't seem to mind it in this one. Not bad, but it doesn't really come across as a true Belgian-style ale."
"Drinkability: Very good. Must have."
"Notes: Another decent offering from DFH, though not quite my favorite. I'd look for this if the store is out of 60 Minute and I'm craving something a little different."
"This beer poured a dark amber-brown with a niced sized head that only leaves a little lace and only leaves a small film as the beer goes down. The smell is mostly dark berry fruits (maybe raisins!). The taste is also the same fruity tastes you normally get from a belgain without the yeast flavor and overall its just a weak flavor but still pretty good. The mouthfeel is good on carbonation and above average on thickness but still a little more watery than I would like from a Belgian. Overall a better than average Belgian but still not the best. It was a good crossover Belgian for my roomate who would not normally try an agressive beer."
"-Adam"
"Drinkability: Couldn't drink too many of these... a little too sweet, and pretty high in abv, although you can't really taste it."
"Very nice deep chestnut brown color. Aroma of malt, Belgian yeast. Somewhat sulfury. Traces of raisens and dates. Big malty flavor. Some bitterness. Sugary, slick sweetness. Slight alcohol presence. Plenty of body though still retains a mellow softness. A damn fine beer. Batches seem to vary at times in flavor or consistency but I have enjoyed this one since it first came out. In my all round top 10 for sure."
"This pours red from the bottle, almost scarlet. A tight creamy looking head caps it off. It begs you to drink. This smell is so complex I don't even know how to begin but to say it has a fruity sweetness to it. The taste is sharp fruit, like pears or white grapes followed by just the smallest hint of grain. Me? I love it. The mouthfeel is nice and creamy, something I feel like I could drink for days. This is one complex brew. It may not be perfect from every angle but it covers enough bases to be irresistable. I will buy this again and again. Its even better on tap!"
"I'm reading the label on this beer and thinking I'm not sure I'm gonna like it, so I was probably prejudiced from the start. It was a nice brown beer with a thick coffee-colored head. It had a fruity molasses smell to it, and a very sweet fruity taste. It looked robust, but was rather bland. Still, fairly pleasant to drink."
"This beer poured out a deep reddishbrown color with a nice large head.The smells were of raisins and molassas and the taste had that as well.It was sweet and very enjoyable and you hardly even notice the alcohol.This is another fine offering from Dogfish."
"Drinkability: Despite the high ABV, this proved to be a very drinkable beer. Rich, often quizical taste that really keeps you guessing. Fine craftsmanship. Highly recommended."
"D: Very interesting beer, never heard of one brewed with rasin before. Goes down very easily for being slightly high in ABV, would recommend for sure."
"Raison D'etre might be just a little too fruity for my tastes, but overall it's another quality entry from DFH."
"This reminds me an American brown ale without any nutty component. A touch pricey and hard to find but I'd swill these all day long if I could. Goes down easy, but provides a pleasant lingering element that prolongs satisfaction. Lots of booze is always a plus. It comes strongly recommended from me though it's unlike any beer I've had before."
"Raison D'Etre is a dark reddish brown with a small, off-white head. Retention is pretty weak. Aroma has plenty of Belgian sugary sweetness with an edge of fruity yeast. A tiny trace of alcohol is also noted. The primary taste is of mild, dark fruit malt meeting Belgian sugar. An earthy, almost burnt malt flavor is also present. A spicy, peppery yeast flavor weaves nicely through the dominate malt. The overall complexity here is quite nice, there is quite alot here to enjoy. This is one of my favorite Belgian-styled beers of the few I've sampled."
"Drinkability  I really like this one. Good drinkability given the high ABV but it will catch up to you. Interesting and enjoyable even if it is not the most classic interpretation of the style."
"Like a lot of the Dogfish Head stuff, this is one weird beer. Pours the color of burnt caramel, with a decent head that fades quickly. The aroma is full of overpowering candi/beet sugar, with just a hint of golden raisin that comes through for me only with some very deep inhalations. Someone else actually pointed that out to me; the candi sugar is really, really strong. The taste follows up, with lots of sweetness and some fruits in the background, though they're once again overpowered by the sugar. The mouthfeel is syrupy; it sticks in your mouth and lingers for a while. Had to rinse with some water before trying other beers. This ain't a beer you want to drink a lot of. One, once in a while, and done. Dogfish Head beers are often like this: interesting to try, but not necessarily something to keep going back to. It's a good thing for them they've got the 60- and 90-minute IPAs..."
"Drinkable? I think so, and I am going to grab one for a night cap."
"Based on my original thoughts of this beer, I thought nothing but bad. After a year, it has improved greatly. But it still is to me only an interesting diversion."
"Overall a solid Belgian style beer from Dogfish. It's not as complex as some of my favourites, but it is an easy drinking, smooth flavoured beer that is enjoyable in the mouth."
"Overall an interesting beer. Not, by any means, a prime example of the style, but i think this one should get a lot of credit. I would love to drink this beer anytime, no matter what they called it."
"This is a big belgian style brew. Not for everyone as its finer tastes might escape some(trying not to sound like a beer snob). Poors with a white head and golden color. The belgian beet sugar and raisons mellow this one out so that you forget about the high abv nearly 8%!!! If you see it pick it up as it is a rare example of a heavy belgian pale."
"Creamy and smooth mouthfeel with a medium to heavy body. Very pleasant drinking 8% beer."
"This beer was labled as ""The best beer of 2005"" at a local beer shop. That piqued my interest. The label stated that it was brewed with Belgian beet sugars and green raisins (that's definately not passing the Reinheitsgebot!). The beer sounded pretty unique, so I decided to try it. The biggest surprise, however, was that this tasted pretty much like any other ale that I've had. What makes it impressive is that it's 8% abv. You can't tell that by taste (I didn't even realize it until I looked it up here). A very drinkable beer when you consider that it's stronger than Colt 45! Try it if you can find it."
"If you are looking for a complex and sweet tasting beer that challanges the palate then put this one on for a try. You will be glad you did!"
"Mouthfeel: a little thin considering how bold the tastes are; feels somehow insubstantial. Carbonation burns a little at the end, but again I just don't feel the high alcohol."
"Mouth feel is light with an intense small bubbled carbonation."
"Pours a deep amber/red with niced thick white head that dissipates quickly. Aroma is very sweet, fruity, and a bit yeasty. Taste is extremely sweet initially with malt and fruit flavors. There is also a distinct tart flavor present and just a bit of bitterness in the finish. It is full bodied and somewhat syrupy. This beer is quite good but it's a bit too sweet for me to drink any more than a single bottle at once."
"I am a huge fan of Dogfish for its fine microbrews, and I dare say that the Raison D'etre is its capstone. I love it's sweet, smooth aftertaste, and regard drinking it on tap as one of my favorites. It is hard to find in bottles, much less on tap. So if you do see it on a menu or in a cooler, indulge yourself."
"Cheers!"
"Another great ale from Dogfish Head."
"A burgundy colored brew that remains somewhat translucent and has a nice head that leaves behind a bit of lacing. Aromas of plums, raisins, alcohol, and burnt sugar seem to come out nicely. The raisins were a bit unexpected for this style, but a welcome discovery. The taste is mild for this style with the interplay between fruity bitterness and specialized candy sweetness not as well as could be. The raisins definitely dominate the brew as it warms to such an extent, it detracts from the overall taste and texture. Though the alcohol was well concealed, when mixed with the raisins, it created a sour taste in my throat, hence the reduction in drinkability. Worthy of trying for it's unique take on this style."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable. The 8% abv is a little tough, so beware."
"I would say this is one-of-a-kind, and an interesting experiment. Minimal head, this one pours out brown with orange hues. Smells somewhat of leather and vegetables, if that makes sense. Odd smell, to say the least. Not bad though, just not what I'd expect. A very warm taste. The alcohol is forefront, with a sweet tartness behind it. The ""green raisins"" used in the brewing impart a fruity taste. Mouthfeel is good, non-slick, smooth. Drinkability is about as good as you can get from such an strange beer. Glad I tried it, might buy again."
"This was my first and last six pack of this brew. Pours with nary a head, just a thin white film. Malty aroma with burnt overtones and a bit of bubblegum. Taste is sweet, malty, burnt tasting - don't care for it at all. Very little hops presence, just a cloying sweetness. Definitely not one of Dogfish Head's better beers, but a step above Saint Gootz (this tastes rather similar to SG)."
"Happy Holidays!"
"I really enjoyed this one. Make sure you don't serve it too cold as you'll lose a lot of the subtle flavors. Raison D'etre is very tasty and complex, and I'd be glad to have one again. In fact, seeing as I bought a 6 pack, that's all but certain. Green Raisins, if you're in there, beware, I'm hunting for you!"
"Drinkability: By no means a bad-tasting beer, but would not be suited to long sessions because of its high alcohol content."
"Drinkability: A good and interesting BSDA, but not among the elites of the style. Thanks to LuckySevens82 for the sample."
"With this one and the many others, dogfish head is slowly becoming my favorite brewery. Job well done!"
"Will revisit this one again soon and add more to the review."
"Pours a dark brown/copper color, not much carbonation, very small head which dissappeared quickly, not much lacing at all. Scents are sweet, grapes, and caramel. Nice sweet caramel taste with a dry kinda flat finish though, the alcohol is hidden pretty well. Medium body. This brew is very drinkable, another excellent brew from dogfish head."
"Since I was in a bar last Saturday and this was on the menu but not available, I was even more excited to get my hands on it. Very impressive."
"Well, this is not DFHs best endeavor, but it is not bad. DFH seems to have set the bar pretty high and it would be hard to make every beer a winner. I wouldnt suggest that you buy a sixer, just try it on tap if you can."
"Very sweet...no...extremely sweet, but in a good way. Dangerously easy to drink. Strong alcohol sneaks up on you easy. I went through two bottles without breaking a sweat early Thanksgiving afternoon. Wow, I must admit it hit me hard a few minutes after I finished the second bottle."
"Taste is different to say the least. A bitter twang resonates throughout the drink making it difficult to pick up on any constituent ingredients. It kind of tastes like water from an old lead pipe, but with chocolatey malt and a residual fruit note. This brew's body is smooth with a low to moderate carbonation. Mouthfeel is syrupy and sticky. Not terrible, but not desirable either. Definitely seems like a beer that I would have to try a couple times before I could figure it out."
"The taste began as a semi-sweet, crisp smack in the face but ended up finishing subtle but dry. Lots of flavor, lots of alcohol taste. It was suprisingly smooth, clean and refreshing, and balanced very well."
"Nothing impressive here."
"Drinkability: An ok beer to try once or twice. Dont buy the whole 6."
"One note, I purchased a six pack of this six months ago and at the time, I cared even less for the beer then I do now. My taste buds may be playing a trick on me but the drinkability seems to have gone up considerably with the brief aging period as has the orange in the noseor maybe Im just more in the mood for this sort of beer this week. Who knows?"
"This stuff is pretty smooth and fairly tasty, but I think 2 bottles would be my max for a night."
"It's got some muscle, not surprisingly, and the flavor, while rather segmented and busy, is also intriguingly unusual. The ABV is never glaring, but it becomes more apparent as the glass drains. It's reasonably drinkable, but common sense mitigates that a bit. It's a crafty, sly heavyweight, worth trying for sure."
"Pours dark brown with a beige head and quite a bit of lacing. Smell is dark fruits and a woody hit that must be from the hops. Taste was rather disappointing, a little hint of Belgian yeast and candi and then a vinous finish that seemed incongruous to my taste buds. Mouthfeel was full enough but I don't think I would want more than one. I've had these before and never have I gotten very excited about them."
"I really enjoyed this beer. Nice sipping on an Autumn afternoon."
"Velveted and smooth."
"D- This beer is dry and has some interesting flavors but it is missing a lot of complexity. The raisins and beets just don't have the complexity that are needed in the malt bill to make this a good solid beer in this style."
"Pours a deep amber with ruby highlights, topped by a half-inch of creamy tan head. Sweet nose of dark fruit, raisins, molasses, dark sweet malt, and a hint of both Belgian ale yeast and alcohol. Palate is understated at first - initially, the flavor almost isn't there. Some sweet malt, raisin, and Belgian yeast are present mid-palate, along with subtle notes of hops and dark wood. Some serious alcohol warming is present on the finish. Mouthfeel is nice and creamy, very pleasurable, then slgihtly dry on the finish. Packs quite a whallop, making it almost difficult to finish the bottle. Still, a pleasure to drink."
"Used to love this beer.. back when I had a raison to drink mediocre beers. I ordered one at a concert recently, and used it to hold down the program while I enjoyed the show. I'm sure the cleaning crew didn't enjoy taking care of the 16oz. (well ok, maybe 15) of liquid that I poured into the trash can. Sorry guys!"
"No head and brownamber beer. Nose is very malty but also lots of cardboard, candy carramellic candy. Good chocolate hint also and sweet overall caracter. Taste is also very carramellic and chocolate, sweet carracter that hides alcohol content well. Still to me an overall very oxidated impression and could well be that this one was a litle over the top. Full and thick mouthfeel though that is enhanced by low carbonisation and feels like a thick soup. Low bittered but clean. Well drinkable but nothing special IMO."
"The taste has a bit of a biscuity malt profile to it, but the sweetness balances that out quite nicely, along with the fruits. Very refreshing for such a strong beer. Little to no hops detected. This is like drinking a juice, but it's still distinctly beer. Nice job DFH. I must try the D'Extra now."
"Interesting try, but I don't find the mouthfeel to be very pleasant. Reminds me of spiked grape juice (which I dislike very much - that's about ""grape juice"" portion, I really don't mind ""spiked""). For me the value of this beer is in experimentation. I'll try it again if I see it on tap. Worth a try just for a taste of something different."
"Overall, a very good easy drinking beer even at 8%. Maybe not my reason for living, but I will buy this again."
"This is unlike any Belgian-style ale Ive encountered. I am generally a huge fan of Dogfish Heads work, but I must admit that after my first one of these little babies I had to question my perception of this brewery. After familiarizing myself with the raison of this beer I came to appreciate it a bit more. I think the key to enjoying it is drinking it on its own terms. Its not Belgian. It is strong. It is definitely drinkable--- still, I wont be purchasing another six pack in the near future."
"D - Not exactly my favorite style, but I sure liked it. It goes down very smooth, and lightens the mood with an 8% ABV."
"5 minutes later, a pleasant bitter feeling (not really aftertaste) still haunts the mouth. Great beer, looking forward to the Raison D'Extra"
"Notes: Can't say I'm too crazy about this one. SO far I've tried the 90 min IPA from DFH and loved it and also enjoyed the 60 min. This one just doesn't stack up in my opinion, however there are definitely worse six packs I could have in my fridge and I won't complain about drinking the others, just a little disappointing."
"This is a full flavored ale with lots of sugar and spices.This isn't too strong of a taste,but a full fruity flavor.A very good ale that's worth drinking as a everyday beer.Dogfish Head gets high marks for always trying different beers."
"Overall impression: Very complex beer, but very drinkable as well. Definitely an interesting offering from a creative brewer."
"Drinkability: One to savor. I could probably do more than one but I won't. Definitely works for me in the fall and will probably be even better once the temperature drops a bit more. Recommended."
"This is a decent Belgian Strong Dark Ale. There are just better examples out there."
"cheers..."
"A decent beer, but not one I will go out of my way to seek out again."
"That's too harsh an assessment. Raison D'Etre isn't a failure by any means, but it doesn't hold together well enough to be anything more than a decent, quasi-drinkable curiosity. If the rumors of retirement for this beer are true, I certainly won't lose any sleep over it."
"Pleasant and complex. Wish it had a slightly more prominent hop presence."
"this one is pretty darn smooth considering the style. it smells very sweet and malty and it is. i tried to pick up a raison smell but i couldn't really find any. there is no head or lacing on this one which was a surprise, but ti does feel foamy and full once you take a drink. i'm glad i tried it."
"A big beer like this needs to be sipped and enjoyed slowly. Not a session beer, but one that would be excellent on a chill Fall or Winter evening."
"Pours a shimmering rusty amber with one finger white head that leaves quickly with some lacy remnants. Aroma is nice, raisins, brown sugar, and sweet malts. Flavor is more of the same, sweet fruits and dark brown mapley sugar over a malt backbone. Not much of a hop presence. Mouthfeel is light and crisp, the alcohol is present but not overbearing for 8%. A nice little beer here that I enjoyed quite a bit. Sweet but not cloying, I could see this as a nice winter warmer as well."
"this is very drinkable, very enjoyable belgium ale. This is really nice, and i find it surprising that the score for this is not higher."
"This beer is absolutely great by any definition. A nearly perfect beer in every respect."
"Drinkability - A little heavy for drinking too many. This is a great after dinner or night cap."
"This beer pours with a nice copper red body, light haze, and light head. A little darker than I've seen it before, have they tinkered with it? The aroma is primarily that of apricots and alcohol, but there is enough malt and a hint of hops to keep this well-balanced. Taste is very dry, a lot less sweet than you'd expect, but otherwise lightly fruity, some malt, and a bitter finish. Pleasantly drinkable, unlike other apricot beers (like #9), I could perhaps even make this a session beer."
"Pours clean and bright gleaming ruby copper, with only a hint of haze. Tiny head that fizzles quickly. Moderate carbonation. Smells of bready yeast and ripe dark fruits. High alcohols are apparent in smell and taste, with near-solvent characteristics. Bone dry, with a smooth and slightly creamy mouthfeel and decent malt backbone considering the dryness. Peppery and slightly numbing after the swallow."
"Good mouthfeel, very nice carbonation level. Excellent drinkability. I could have gone for another of these right away, despite the fact that it was essentially a very rich and sweet beer. I'd recommend this one to anyone looking for something a little bit offbeat and adventerous. Would make a great dessert beer, especially if paired with fruits or light cheeses. Good job."
"poured a deep reddish color with only sparse head. Smell was extremely enjoyable with a mixture of dark fruits (plums, raisins) and loads of malt. Taste follows through, being strongly fruity and malty. Finish is very smooth with lack of alcohol noted. A very nice beer to have, but one is enough."
"Pours a brown-red with solid crimson/blood highlights in decent light. Dense thin head, light-brown, laced well. Smelled like an old yellow raisen and vodka 'home remedy' my granny used to make. The taste is a bit unusual to me, good but weird. I get twinges of pomegranite and cherry, a lot of sharp sweetness that instantly dissapears into a better balance. It's an odd beer and I'm rating it higher than I usually would but after an odd week it seemed fitting. Very drinkable for the ABV."
"I really enjoy this ale, but for such a complex brew I'd need to move on to something else after a couple. Still, very interesting and enjoyable - I will be getting this again."
"This one's real complexly flavorful in a quality Belgian way. I'll be getting more."
"Overall I like this brew and would say it's worth a try to those that like sweeter tasting brews. The 8% alcohol is absolutely deceptive in this."
"Pours a reddish brown color with a big white head and lots of visible carbonation. The aroma is sweet, but faint. The taste is as subtle as the aroma. Kind of sweet, kind of raisony. The mouthfeel is medium thin. Overall, this beer isn't bad, but it isn't good either. I wasn't on BA when I took notes on this beer, so I assumed the style was a fruit beer. I was suprised and disappointed when I found it to be a Belgain Strong Dark Ale. For it is a bad interpretation of that style, IMO. It's not flavorful enough, and the aroma is too faint."
"Mouthfeel is slick. Flows right down the throat. I think this is pretty drinkable considering the alcohol content, and the sweetness. Now, I don't think it's THAT sweet, but a lot of others do. I could see myself not realizing just how much of it I'm imbibing. I really like this. Thanks dogish, for making something that doesn't taste like overwhelming alcohol to me. Now, I TRULY respect you."
"I love Dogfish Head Brewery for the quality of its beers and for its daring and creativity. It is probably my favorite brewery. Whether you're brewing beer, playing music, or writing stories, when you take changes and do things differently, you will sometimes produce a bad result. This is what happened to Dogfish Head with Raison D'etre. The tastes are oddly cobbled together--raisins and hops and who knows what else, mingling awkwardly like incompatible members of a reality show. For all the oddness of the beer, it's actually bland in many ways, particularly during the first few sips. The more I drank, the more the odd and unpleasant tart and sweet fruit tastes came forward. I would have preferred the relative blandness of the first few sips."
"Medium-heavy in bidy. Mouthfeel was smooth and mildly syrupy at the start and finish. The aftertaste was long lasting on the malt. Drinkability is only average for this brew."
"Here's the rub, for me anyway, there was a way too strong Raisin aftertaste. It left a cloying, unpleasant type film on the palate, almost like a bad shiraz. I also like to swirl the glass and savor each sip, that wasn't the thing here either. This is a disappointment but then I thought, Dogfish must be going for this. If this is the case, and you love the raisin taste of shiraz,(try ""Jake's Fault Shiraz"" out of California) you will love this and think it is the best beer ever. For me, It started great but finished with the aftertaste."
"It pour a dark reddish brown with no head but high carbination. Almost like pepsi. There is absolutely no head, just alittle foam. The aromas of a red bourdeaux come to mind. It also reminescent of a saison. there are some spices in there that I can't pick out. I read about this beer, and brew my own; so I boiled raisins one time and know exactly what they taste and smell like. I can definitely taste them in here. The mouthfeel is definitely one that I can't say I enjoy too much. Its too sharp on the palette, and not easy to take. This is definitely out of the box thinking for brewing. Sam is definitely creative. But for myself I think this might be an aquired taste. This was also sitting on the back of a warm shelf for a while in the store. It was dust covered and bent up. I'm hoping the next time I taste it, there will be a difference."
"I don't know if my opinion has changed much for this beer. I still enjoy it, and it's still a great beer from Dogfish Head."
"sonofDon"
"Drinkability: For a Belgian dark, this lacks the caramel malt and dark fruit complexity that I associate with the style; an interesting experiment, but there are other Belgian darks that I prefer more"
"This brewery is incapable of brewing a bad batch. I passed on this beer for a while because I didn't think that I would fully appreciate it. I was wrong. An extremely complex and fruitful beer. Pours with a medium to high viscocity. Brown with some burgundy and purple violet tones. Tan / burgundy head falls to a trace, laces well, nice oily cling to the glass. Smells of cocoa, deep dark friuts, all hidden behind a malt base. Lightly hopped and tart. Tastes fruity sweet with pruned, dates, raisons, figs. All the goodness that you'd like from these fruits with only a mild tartness. A red wine-like muskiness in the body. Silky smooth rich body that nicely fades into the finish. Very consistant flow down the throat. Mild cherries show up in the finish. Mildly drying and mildly sweet. Dangerously easy to drink. I don't particularly like dark fruits, but I love the beers that exhibit their flavors--go figure."
"The alcohol cuts down on the drinkability, just from a taste factor. In my opinion Sam's ""reason for being"" is his 90 Minute, that's a damn fine beer."
"Pours a deep attractive purplish red but with the faintest head that disappears immediately. Very strong aroma of raisins, toffee, and dark fruits. Alcohol comes in suprisingly strong on the first sip, but blended with the dark raisin and fig flavors it's actually not too bad. Very sweet and somewhat syrupy in mouthfeel. This isn't bad at all, but I can't see myself ever drinking more than one in a sitting."
"The head is small, beige-white and dense, but dies fast. The beer is dark, clear, toffee-brownish. Nuts and sweet fruit in the nose. The front is sweet, rich caramel. Thick and sweet through the middle: toffee, malt and butter. Alcohol in the finish with sweet ripe fruit and more peanuts. Sweet after taste reminds me of baking ingredients... fruitcake? nutbars? Anyway, overall, not bad. I like the nuts. The malt is good and butter, but on the whole it's a little too sweet for me."
"On a side note...before this tasting I had this with a plate of 4 cheese tortellini and 5 cheese sauce. I recommend trying this beer with some nice italian food. It almost doubles as a sweet red wine."
"nutty brown color with no visible head or carbonation, dropped hefty into a long, tall, ""delaney's"" glass. tart brown sugar smell. fresh ground coffee notes, raisins and dates in the aroma. has a real alcohol-laden air about it. spicy with licorice, clove.. black pepper really dominates here. surprisingly drinkable for something so flavorful. can't wait to try the d'extra.. think this profile would kick ass as a bigger beer."
"Drinkability: Not bad. 8% ABV would cut a hearty session short, but I could defiinitely sip a couple after dinner."
"Drinkability- Tasty brew, original taste for me with the tobacco leaf added in. I've had many better dark ales, but this one isn't bad at all. Thanks for the sample guys!"
"No go here. I was anxious to try this brew after it came highly recommended at my local bottle shop. Poured prettily enough, but as soon as I smelled it I knew I was headed for trouble. Very strong rubbing alcohol, and the taste was no better. Very, very syrupy sweet, and heavy alcohol taste. Bleeeech. I barely finished the bottle..."
"Maybe it was because I had a St. Berny 12 last night, but I just don't like this all that much."
"Definitely not impressed. Pours an ugly clear copper color with absolutely no head after 30 seconds. Taste was metallic and alcoholic with some dark fruit and syrupy sweetness. A nice spiciness at the end is tasty though. Hardly any carbonation. Maybe this was a bad bottle. I have some more and will rereview if different."
"An interesting brew, but definitely one I'll have to try again."
"I paired this with some grilled steak and potatoes and it was perfect, an incredible meal. If you're looking for a true Belgian Dark Ale, I would try a different beer. While I feel it doesn't represent the style well, I will definitely be buying this beer again."
"Pours medium-dark mahogany, very little carbonation, no head, slight lacing. Aroma consists of strong raisins, sweet caramel bready malts. Taste is at first very sweet and immediately rather tart and strong from the raisins. Smooth malts and hops in the foundation are good, would have liked it to be a little smoother. High octane can be noticed on the swallow, burning slowly down. Decently smooth. A unique beer that I'd drink again of course."
"Pours a dark reddish brown with a small head that disappears quickly. Very little carbonation, I can almost count the bubbles rising in the glass. Aroma is of malt & sweetness (must be the raisins). Taste is an initial big hit of rich maltiness with a sourness/tartness in the middle. Some grape-y, winelike character. Very subtle hop presence. Where is the 8% abv? The folks at Dogfish Head are masters at hiding the alcohol in their high octane beers. Wait, there it is, a subtle burn on the swallow followed by a nice warming feeling going down the chest & into the stomach. Again, very well hidden, almost TOO well hidden. No more than 2 of these if you're planning on getting behind the wheel (and even that's pushing it). Nice, almost chewy mouthfeel, you know you're drinking a brew of substance here. Overall, one of my all-time favorites!! Dogfish Head is the brewery that got me into micros in the first place!!"
"Overall, I would say that I recommend it, with reservations. It's not a great example of the style, but it does all right on its own. It also is a little more fruity than one might expect, but it's still drinkable."
"The beer after its disinterment from the 12-ounce brown bottle sets in the glass a brilliantly clear burnished copper color with a personable creamy light tan head, that erodes rather quickly, leaving a blanket of lace to obscure the glass. Nose has a nice malt sweetness with under tones of fusel alcohol, raisins and a slight musk smell also present, quite a treat for the old schnozzle, start is somewhat sweet with a big malt presence, the top is moderate in its feel to the palate. Finish is benignly acidic and the hop pertinent in their spicy bite, aftertaste has a wine like dryness, a yummy beer that I finally have available at all times, Hell Yeah!"
"Slàinte!"
"Poured a neat purple-tinged brown. Finger deep head that receded to the edges of the glass with a spot in the center. Saw some sediment pour into the glass. Is this bottle conditioned? The aroma is slightly yeasty with grapes and raisins in it. The raisins also come out in the flavor, as well as prunes. Love the dried fruit. Makes me think of a dessert wine. Also, molasses and other Belgian sugars. Bit yeasty. Mouthfeel is very full, but the alcohol is a bit stronger and noticeable than I expected. Nice and drinkable, but the alcohol burn may be a bit much after a while"
"An unusual and especially pleasing Belgium Strong Dark Ale."
"The low carbonation hurts the mouthfeel. The awkward nose, high abv, and lackluster taste hurt the drinkability."
"Medium bodied with a mellow carbonation and a bit of oily slickness. Goes down easy and I find it to be an enjoyable brew. I could see grabbing a sixer of this again in the future."
"Pours a honey colour with minimal head into a Tulip Glass. The smell is of raisins, plums, dark fruit, and a bit of hops underwritten with alcohol. The taste is much the same - The belgian beet sugars make it sticky-sweet, with raisins, dark fruit and hops ... but an acidic alcohol that pervades the ale and becomes worse as it warms ruins the whole deal. This ale gives me heartburn. The mouthfeel is gooey and somewhat flat, again with an acidic alcohol kick that is unpleasant. Because of that, the this ale is very hard to drink."
"This is unlike any Belgian Strong Dark Ale that I have imbibed. Strong fits, but Belgian? Strange. Weird. This was a tough review. Raison DEtre just didnt taste or feel right. Overall, its a bit better than average but not a beer that Id recommend based on this sample."
"It's drinkable and different but not something I'd go out of my way to find or pay too much for. May go better with a PBJ than anything exquisite."
"This was an interesting and potent beer that I will have again."
"Plentiful 1/4 inch cream of fungal foam that stayed, and stuck, throughout the pour. Light claret hue with some haze, though it could possibly be due to the temperature the pour was served at; fair amount of action. Candy cane crank of sweet ice on nose, with some fruit funk as well, uh, maybe raisin. Alcohol pummeling on mouth; jam of raspberry and a crunch of light willow ghosts. Could use this as a session ale quite easily, almost too easily as it seems that this is what it quickly, and dangerously, turned in to at this stop."
"Jumped right in with a six pack instead of getting a single. Pours with very little head, but an agressive pour of half the bottle left a small but quickly disappating head. Smell is of dark fruits and a little bit of candi sugar. Nose isn't as assertive as I would've liked but oh well, what's there is pleasant. Taste is suprisingly yeasty but with a strong maltiness and a nice fruity middle. Alcohol presence is notable. Not terrible on it's own but I can pick up much more interesting Belgian darks for about the same price. Interesting but won't be revisiting again after I finish my six pack. (why can't I get Midas Touch in my area???)"
"Looks like a brown ale with ruby highlights. A one inch head soon faded to lace around my stone ipa glass. Aroma was not very strong, some sweetness, like toffee. This tasted of caramel malt and had some raisin flavor too. Slightly syrupy, and moderately carbonated. Like a poor man's Ommegang. Overall, I wasn't very impressed with Raison d'Etre in relation to the other great Dogfish brews I've enjoyed through the years, but it is still a lot better than most beers out there, but for this style, feh."
"Drinkability: The slick mouthfeel is a little odd at first, but does start to become more pleasant toward the end. Drinkability is surprisingly good. It goes down easy and hides its ABV well."
"Drinkability would be higher, but at 8% i'm not sure I could take more than a couple in an evening. As I eluded to earlier, this brew is very easy to drink, and you would have no idea the ABV was so high if you didn't see it on the label yourself."
"Pours a dark copper color. Smell is sweet, candies and some hints of fruit. Tastes of candies, figs, raisons, and a light hint of molasses. For being 8% abv, this is very drinkable. The sweet taste definatley masks the alcohol. Overall another great beer by Dogfish Head."
"Copper pour with little head. Smells like candied fruit, molasses, some sweetness, and a bit of malt. Taste is very sweet and raisiny with other fruit flavors shining through as well. The flavor didn't really do it for me, I felt it was just this side of cloying, and it needed a spicy kick to balance it out that, for me, never arrived. Moreover, I felt the alcohol was way too pervasive in the flavor. It almost reminded me of sweetened raisins if they'd been soaked in vodka. It's an interesting beer, but not one that I have any desire to try again soon. I'm going to put the rest of the six in the cellar for six months to a year and see if I'm more excited to try it."
"12 ouncer sampled, freshenss dating notched on to the label. Pours clear, almond amber, with a tad of egg shell colored head, limited lacing. nose is alcohol, raisins, rum and candi sugars. Strong flavorful brew, notes of alcohol, figs, rum soaked raisins, apricots. Complex, heady creation. Wrap your tongue around some of this stuff."
" Drinkability is good a nice strong dark ale one of my first after finding this site, still find it enjoyable and good."
"tasty. i like the affect of the raisins (inspired me to throw some in my own belgian homebrew), but not sure how many of these i could whack back"
"I loved it and will enjoy many more!"

"Bender: A 6 pack of this is clearly in order. I think that this could sway the parents to switch from Manhattans to this."
"This is another interesting brew from DFH. Appearance was kind of a bummer. It was a brown color with a very small tan head. The head died out very fast, which is a big bummer in my book. I favor the bigger headed brews. Smell was pretty nice. Had elements of various spices(one of which smelled like cinnamon), alcohol, and grapes. The taste was similar, but also had a tinge of a dark liquor, something like a whiskey or bourbon, as well as the presense of cinnamon. It is quite drinkable, just something you wouldn't pound down. Good fer a sippin' brew."
"poured amber ith a white head that did stay around very long. aroma fruity, raisins, malts, hints of choc. flavor aout the same os aroma but with hints of honey I like the way the alcohol came out.left the mouth a little dry. not to bad will drink again"
"Poured a dark amber colour, hazy, with a cream coloured head. Nose is bready, raisins and a bit of alcohol. Taste was well balanced. Plum, raisins, tart, dry, some wine like qualities and a sweet fruitiness. Got a yeasty taste to it too. Mouthfeel is a bit syrupy. Aftertaste is grainy. A great beer."
"I just finished one of these, and I still haven't really decided whether I liked it or not. Poured from a bottle into a brandy snifter. 1/2"" head, nice lacing. I really like the color. Deep reddish-brown, almost like a port wine. Smell is also very ""winey."" Taste is ok, with strong hints of red wine (Shiraz?) and raisins. As others have mentioned, however, it's too sweet. Maybe with a little less sugar this could be an outstanding beer. Mouthfeel ok... pretty creamy actually. 8% ABV as well as the sweetness hurts this one on drinkability. Like I said, I'm still not sure what exactly to think of this beer. I supposed I'd certainly drink another if it was offered to me, but I doubt I'll buy any more."
"Sip away and enjoy with some fresh greens, balsamic, black pepper and sheep's milk feta."
"Overall, it was OK. I wouldn't turn down another if someone else was paying. But I won't be going out of my way to get another."
"Pours a dark murky brown with a wispy tan head and patches of lace. The aroma is of raisins, bran, bready malts and a wiff of hops. The taste is an intricate amalgam of different malt flavors. There are dark fruit, chocolate and bran flavors that get breadier as they mingle with the hops. Hop flavor is perceptable though very subdued. Hop bitterness is evident in the finish. The alcohol is definitely noticable, though its pretty modest for its ABV. The mouthfeel is thick and slightly creamy, with a silky smooth carbonation."
"First Rogue, now DFH. I seem to be getting the lower end beers from the breweries I'd like to try. Anyways, Raison D'etre was poured into a goblet. I'm thinking belgian style deserves a belgian glass. Was I wrong? Beer pours a red wine and brown colour. Pretty much no head. Violently poured, it comes with maybe a double fingernail thick that quickly disipates to nothing. Not a very good appearance. Smells of brown sugar, wine, alcohol, caramel and butterscotch. Not too bad, but a bit off with the sugar. Taste is too sweet. It's like red wine. Actually, it reminded me of Jewish wine. Very, very sweet. Raisins, sugar, malt, caramel, sugar and raisins. Mouthfeel is harsh from the alcohol, and actually quite thin for something so syrupy tasting. Drinkability is low. It's just not a good beer."
"Bottle: Poured copper color ale with a very small head that disappeared a tad too fast. Aroma is quite sweet with alcohol soaked raisins being quite noticeable. Body is quite full and carbonation is very low. Taste is very interesting resembling more like a barley wine (sweet raisins, warming alcohol) then anything else. The Belgian yeast must have been covered because I had a hard time detecting it. Overall, this is quite different but very enjoyable. Wouldnt mind laying a couple of them down to see the evolution of this beer."
"Poured from a bottle, a kind of dark orangy red colour with absolutely no head. Smells interesting, caramel and raisin type smells. Has a sweet taste, buttery with some caramel and fruit. Burns a bit on the way down. Mouthfeel is pretty thick and creamy. Decent beer, kind of disappointed by it though, had been waiting a while and it let me down. But give it a try."
"Pours a brilliantly clear copper-amber color, and is topped by a thin tan head. The aroma is rich with notes of brandy alcohol, rich raisin, some notes of tropical fruit. The beer is lightly sweet, yet rich and creamy, with perhaps a hint of butterscotch. There is a lot of great fruit flavors here, there is some definite raisin notes here as well as Muscat, and flower nectar. There are also some subtle spice notes here that seem to be yeast/ fermentation derived. This beer is quite interesting, and in some ways quite light, yet it is still quite rich tasting. This is quite tasty, and is certainly proof that Dogfish Head certainly likes to push the boundaries a bit."
"Overall Impression: This is a dangerous being; like most things with a true sense of purpose. Subtle but driven, creamy yet strong. Too drinkable, the flavor is heavy but not intense so I could probably do a few more, but the alcohol is about to put me on the floor. A little light for sipping, this is a good I only have time for one beer beer. Another offbeat beer from Dogfish Head and like the rest, worth seeking. So, SO glad theyve made it to Texas!"
"The taste was lightly bitter, and medium malt body, but there was a little funkiness caused by the raisins. This odd taste lasted into the aftertaste. Not totally pleasant. Better than macros, but not great in terms of a craft brew. And it really hurt me to grade it as low as I did, since several of the DFH brews are my favorites, but I think they left a 7-10 split with this one."
"12oz crown top bottle. nice looking ale...dark red-mahogany color.... smallish off white head that laces well...tiny bubbled carbonation. The nose is filled with a musty grape scent from the beet sugar/rasins and Belgian yeast...pleasant aroma. Started with an oily vinous mouthfeel like a port sherry...complex... tasted of molassass, spice, herbs, grapes but this gives way to an impression of a spiced brandy as the alcohol is detected...the finish is lengthy and warming as a drying bitterness takes over. A unique strong ale...sweet without cloying, complex and vinous yet drinkable. I will be putting a 1/2 dozen in my cellar to see what age will do to this wonderful ale."
"12 oz. brown bottle with packaged on date clearly marked on the label."
"The bottle says ""mahogany", but I say it looks more like a reddish-orange, a tad dark. The head dissipated pretty rapidly, but that isn't uncommon for high-alcohol beers. The aroma has a lot of a kind of woody, higher-alcohol notes along with a pleasant caramel hint blended with a slightly musty note that is also pleasant although unusual. The flavor is nice, slightly malty sweet, but also a lot of alcohol noticable and touches of honey, dried fruit, and a slight bitterness at the end. This is good and interesting but I find it less drinkable than some higher alcohol beers, maybe because I think I can taste the alcohol. This is still a great sippin beer though."
"Not a bad mouthfeel, but you can really taste the alcohol. Sort of woody strong. While not their best effort, will do once in a while."
"Drinkability is very good on this one, the high abv is completely hidden except in the mouthfeel. This is a great beer!"
"Prosit."
"Pours a deep ambered brown with a huge off-white headskie. Taste sweet, almost but not too sweet. The beet sugar and raison flavors are kickin' it in style and 'tude. Not quite as good as the hype on the beer would lead you to believe, but a damn fine brew none the less. Certainly worth checking out. I hadn't had this beer in a couple years and tried it again and I still like it."
"This brew is all about the malts. Not bad."
"Comments - Raison d'être (noun): reason or justification for existence. I don't know if I would go that far, but I give a tip of my hat to Dogfish Head for this creative beer. Definitely purchase this one and try it out. This is no casual beer drinker's beer. I suggest something else to wean your macro-swlling buddies off their bad habit."
"Very unique, and hard to classify. Not quite a Belgian, not an American-styled ale. Fruity and reasonably complex. I did not notice the alcohol as much as some others did, and the balance is actually more on the subtle side (my wife had an Ommegang while I was drinking this, and the Ommegang's flavor was much more pronounced - and sweeter). Pours a dark ruby shade, with little head, no lacing. Raisons certainly come to mind. For those who enjoy a dark Belgian-styled ale, (and also fans of Baltic porters?)it's worth trying. I'm glad I have more, as this is a very different beer."
"Extra note: I should mention that this beer has grown on me. When I first tried it, I thought ok--nice but I don't even want a whole pint. It has since grown on me in both the taste and drinkability department."
"Taste starts with sugary sweet candy, and malt. Some plum/raisin mixed with cooked vegetable doppelbock flavor too. Slight bitterness ekes its way in, but doesnt do too much. Finish is long and more sweet than bitter. Mouthfeel is big, mouth-coating, and syrupyalmost cloying. Well made and enjoyable, but a touch sweet for my everyday quaffing."
"d - It's not offensive and quite strong so I would consider it reasonably drinkable. I don't want another, but not because it's bad, but because there are better thigns to drink."
"Nice yeast creamy yummy two dimensional Belgian style. Lower than expected aroma but delivered in beverage experience, fullmouth yeast delivery. Beautiful mahagony dark with mocha colored head, much cream that dissipates into lace. Masterfully done, like Ommegang with extra angles. Better than an average Belgian."
"Packaged 8/2004. Pours a orangy chestnut color with a short-lived light beige head. Bready, biscuity and malty; vinously wine-like nose. A fair bit of yeastiness in the aroma, too. Rather sweet right of the bat, then mild fruitiness kicks in and the finish is light, hoppy and estery. Pretty interesting and unique. You can tell this beer is 8%, there's a slovent-like burn to it. Not too bad, but it is noticable. Worth a try."
"The label is copyrighted 1999, with the 7 etched off. So I don't know how old this beer is. Pours a very hazy dark amber copper. Small head fades quickly into a lace on the edge of the glass. Nose is very malty, the darker ones because I'm picking up a hint of coffee. Dark fruits and the alcohol is quite noticable. First sip, light-moderate carbonation. Wow this beer is interesting. Very malty, pretty strong sweetness. It is also hopped just right. Light bitterness is present in the entire sip. Finishes dry and lightly bitter, and you can definitely feel the alcohol evaporate off the inside of your mouth when you exhale. It definitely warms me up. Great for a desert beer, but I don't think it classifies as a Belgian ale."
"The beer opens with a poignant hops grassiness and a sharp alcohol flavor. it then tails off without much fanfare on the taste buds. It ends with a weaker malt flavor than the aroma suggests. The alcohol/hops combination gives it the sensation of being spicy, which is nice. But it does lack a bit in the flavor department."
"IMHO: Better on tap. Not as well balanced as I had expected."
"Pours a nice chocolate brown with an impressive head. Head's gone quick with no lacing though. Smells of sweet malts, chocolate, raisens (obviously), and a hint of alcohol. Now this is an interesting tasting beer. Had to take a few more sips to figure out what I'm tasting. First the obvious - prunes, raisens and dates, OH MY! Under that, lots of alcohol with little to no carbonation. Hops are not used to the best of their ability. Nice malt flavor on the finish, but a bit too dry. Not enough carbonation in the mouth for me. And, alas, not an incredibly quaffable beer. All in all I'd say a bit too complex without having any focus. Tastes all over the place. Still a very nice brew indeed, but overrated."
"Pours a clear reddish amber color (DFH calls it magogany but it's a tad light in color for that), head fell to a ring quickly. Aroma is fruity and lightly spiced - apples, pears, grassy (?)... not sure... very hard to call. Taste is the same... crisp, fruity (green apples) and really tart, finishes dry. This is really hard to describe. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, with solid carbonation. Drinkability... I'm just not sure. It's definitely an interesting brew but I would probably not have it again."
"Drinkability is nearly as high as it can get. Often a beer with this much alcohol can be hard to drink more than one of, but this libation does not suffer that problem. I recommend this beer without any reservations."
"Pours a medium mahogany into my (gasp) pint glass. Beeswax-colored head has no intentions on staying long, with 8% alcohol to fight against. Smell is of sweet, flowery esters, rum, overripe plums, and raisins. Some malt is apparent, but not emphasized. Taste is more of the same, with a bit more malt coming through now. The beer appears harsh and sharp yet soft and cunning. I'm confused, but intrigued. I will try this again. Perhaps a 6 month cellaring will round this brew out a bit."
"In the end, this is yet another beer I wanted to like far more than I did. Kind of sad, really."
"Having only tried one Dogfish Head brew before this one I was anxiously anticipating trying this one. A medium dark amber color, but almost totally transparent. Not much of a head to speak of on this one at all. The smell on this one is very subtle. I almost can't smell a thing, but with a deep whiff I can pick up on a Belgiany maltiness. Smells sweet and nutty. Tastes better than any other American ""Belgian Beer"" I've had. Sweet, but not too sweet. Fruity characters in there somewhere. Very thick mouthfeel, clings to the tongue. Smooooth. Drinkability... well, I say this in just about every review, but; I could drink this all night. Hmmm. Maybe I just like beer too much. Is that possible? Anyway, a very tasty brew. Go out and get yours."
"I'd recommend seeking this out on tap... after trying both bottle and tap, there's something in the taste missing from the bottle."
"This beer is good, but it is a little too sweet to have more than one at a time."
"This beer would be an excellent choice for a dessert beer or a light after dinner beer."
"I bought this bottle in a beershop in London. Iy pours a hazy mahogany colour with a off-white head. The head disappears quickly though, leaving just a thin rim. It has a malty and sweet smell. Some hint of alcohol in the smell aswell. The taste is malty and sweet from the sugar and some hints of raisins. The mothfeel is smooth and warming. But you can not taste the alcohol. This is a good beer even if i don't like raisins."
"Mouthfeel was medium to medium full. It was a bit thin for a big belgian style but very enjoyable"
"Edit: Trying it again. The beer is a lot better than I gave it credit for earlier. The nose and flavor are very nice. I can't look at it in style, as I don't agree where it is placed."
"I know there were some less than spectacular reviews of this brew, but my botlle was excellent. First, it poured a dark amber with a long lastling creamy head. The smell improved as it warmed, with a definte malt and hop presence....hops had grassy and fruity notes. Taste was initially sweet and upon first taste, somewhat metallic. The metallic quality ebbed as the brew warmed and I noted what seemed like cherries?....it took on an almost wine like quality and ended with a lightly carbonated finish that was somewhat refreshing. Drinkability for the style is good....fairly smooth, but the warming quality reminds you of the ABV. Mouthfeel is suprisingly smooth and has a dry finish. I was pleasantly surprised by this offering."
"this brew looks a bit viscous when pouring it, and has a 5 second tiny head that disappears completely very quickly. sweet malt smell wafts up quickly, with what smells like artificial grape flavour following closely behind. tastes of alcohol and yeast, some apple flavour is also present. alright overall, but i am curious to see what else this brewery has to offer."
"Alcohol presence came and stayed, raisons and, ready? Feet. Very thick, chewy not good."
"Pours a deep red with a fine white head that takes it's cue to exit soon after being poured. The aroma has a hint of sweet malt and a fruitiness that is either contributed by esters or from the green raisins. The flavor is definetly Belgian as it reminds me of a good tripel yet the color throws me off as i keep tasting for sweet malt and carmel flavors. The carbonation of this ale lends more credibility to the Belgian qualities as it just has that Belgian feel that is hard to describe unless you have tasted hundreds of Belgian beers and talked about many of them. Flavor has a slight carbonic bite followed with sweet malt and with a clean finish but with a lingering flavor of malt. I can't taste the green raisins but i do think that the beet sugar gave it that belgian candy sugar quality. I love the innovation that DFH brings to the craft brew scene and i hope to try more of thier strange and interesting beers."
"Medium mouthfeel, smooth and oily with little carbonation. Finishes clean with no unpleasant aftertaste. My palate doesn't quite know what to do with this but it isn't bad. Unsure of how it matches up with the style but impresses me as sort of a hybrid lambic, sitting halfway between a gueuze and a Corsendonk. I would be real curious to see how this ages. Many thanks to spiritdeus for sharing this curious brew."
"All and all a very drinkable beer but I don't think it would go good with food. Still a great beer to sit with friends."
"This is a good beer that I would recommend. Interesting."
"This beer poured a nice mahogany color with a small off white head. The smell was malty/sweet. The taste was a little odd . It is sweet and still somehow sour . The raisins are very pronounced in the flavor. The mouthfeel is almost syrupy. I little too thick. The drinkability was good even though the ABV is high. I enjoyed my second one better. Had it two days later. Maybe this is the kind of flavor that grows on you and gets better and you aquire a taste for it."
"Sweet with raisin undertones (like the label promises) just masking strong alcohol flavors, a long smooth sweet finish(supposedly brewed with belgian beets)."
"All in all, not a bad beer, but just very unfitting of the style. Again you have to give the brewers at Dogfish Head credit for throwing out tradition and creating a unique concoction in its own right. The label reads that it's brewed with a sense of purpose...I'm just not sure what that purpose is."
"Not a very good beer. Harsh and astringant taste with a syrupy feel. Sweet and malty with a carmel taste and a touch of diacetyl. Low carbonation with minimal head and a muted aroma. Not very Belgian flavor, not very tasty either. I had to force this one down, now what am I going to do with the other 5?"
"Smooth in the mouth, bosting a medium carbonation level. A good sipper, very sugary and is a good way to finish off an evening."
"I am pleased that I picked up a single of this to sample."
"This review is based on notes from the first bottles consumed and side notes from the last bottle drank."
" this beer pours a dark amber color with a beige 1"" head that quickly disappeared. there was very little lacing through the ingestion of this tasty brew. sour grapes and alcohol dominate the palate but, with a bitchin' warming effect that follows all the way to the belly. I enjoyed this beer and would recommend and try it again. maybe not a beer that i would wack down a 12 pack of but, a great sipper nonetheless."
"($7.99 / 6-pack)"
"Guest tap at Barley's smokehouse, served in a snifter. This is an outstanding beer on draught. My wife ordered it and drank it, instead of just trying my beer as usual and I think that says it all. Pours a ruddy dark amber/copper color with a medium thin and fluffy off-white head. Thin and sticky lacing. The aroma is a complex blend of sweet fruit (raisins), malt, caramel and brown sugar. Medium-bodied and well-nuanced flavors that are alternatingly sweet and tart. It kind of reminds me of a sweeter version of Arrogant Bastard, with the fruit, hops, malt and other underlygin flavors. The finish is sweet, with creeping alcohol. Overall this is a great beer."
"This copper-brown ale pours with a sizeable head, although it leaves little lace. The sugar aroma my have hints of other notes, but it lacks complexity. The flavors blend sugar sweetness, caramel malt, and raisin flavors with a a mild alcohol flavor. The mouth feel is medium to full bodied but there are times when it felt like I was drinking sugar water. There was a peculiar texture to the fluid. For a Belgian Strong Dark Ale, Raison d'etre is quite drinkable."
"like a belgian but obvoiusly done differently, lacking the big yeasty and phenolics but it does have the fruitiness, strange beer. seems to reveal something about the belgian style in it's lack of complexity when compared to other belgian or belgian styled brews."
"Overall: This is one of the worst offerings from Dogfish Head - completely unbalanced in every way. I won't be buying this again."
"12 ounce bottle. Packaged in 4 (cannot be 2004 based upon when I purchased it)"
"Pours a magnificent dark amber. Scent is crazy complex & rich with banana, brandy, & sweet malts. Flavor is malty & sweet as well, but even more interesting. I'm detecting & enjoying hints of liquor & some mild acidity. Finish is a little watery, but the sweet is balanced beautifully by a kiss of bitter. Most enjoyable."
"Very smooth, very complex, very well rounded flavor. The palate is slighty tart, full of raisins, slightly spicy, slightly bitter and quite enjoyable. Peppery spicyness and sweet sugars are present as well. I am really enjoying this."
"This poured an orangish-brown brown color with an off white 3/4 finger head that dissipated very quickly, yet had an overall appearance of and mouthfeel of a highly carbonated ale. The aroma is of candied sugar with hints of alcohol in the background, but overall sweet smell and maybe some fruit. The taste is also sweet and a little musty. Reminds me of a brown ale, but more complex with maybe a little fig and tobacco. Sweet but not too sweet, bitter but not too high a hop presence. The alcohol content is more pronounced in the aroma and completely subdued while drinking the ale. Very drinkable and overall this is a great ale, and with the relatively low ABV could be a session ale."
"Another solid offering from DFH."
"Dogfish head defies stylistic conventions again, and in my humble opinion..its a winner! For something that is brewed with Belgian yeasts I look forward to more of that musty characteristic but its forgivable. I definitely look forward to having this beer again."
"Yum. This fine beer lacked a head, even though I poured for affect. A nice deep copper coloring. A slightly sweet smell but definitely not in anyway overwhelming. A wonderful taste-somewhat sweet but very pleasant. No hint of alcohol, although it is certainly there. Give it a go."
"I do enjoy Dogfish Heads brews and this is no exception. Not much of a head when I poured it. Smelled strong of malts and fruits. An excellent taste. Malty flavors with a hint of wheat maybe? It is very drinkable for an 8%. The alcohol is very subdued."
"Pours a pale golden brown liquid with a white thick creamy/foamy head that was white. The head disappeared quickly which was disappointing. Smells spicy to me, like cinnamon? Hard to pick up anything else. Taste begins with a decent malt sweetness, followed by a fruit flavor like banana. There was a slight spicyness to the finish. It was thin, I thought, but it was pretty smooth. This beer seemed to be drinkable, but it just didn't do it for me. Still, good to see beer like this. Nonetheless, I am glad I gave it a try."
"Dark amber color with very small head after the pour. Head disappears quickly, but leaves a nice lace 3/4 of the way through the glass. Musty, fruity flavor with a nice, but hard to pinpoint aftertaste. Finishes strong with the taste remaining consistent all the way to the bottom. Highly recommend this one."
"Notes: Quite drinkable at 8%, but I think it is lacking in the finish department. Perhaps that's what increases the drinkability because the taste ends too soon. This one is hard to explain, but it's an overall decent offering. Cheers!"
"When poured into a Pilsner glass, the body was murky reddish brown with almost no head to speak of. The carbonation lasted for all of three seconds and then left the room. Aroma was complex and interesting. There were notes of rum, raisins, licorice, and candied apples on the nose. The taste was similar to the aroma: fruity, peppery, vinous, and dry. The alcohol content is high, but very well hidden. I think they went overboard with the adjuncts and neglected the malt in this beer. The result is a thin, watery, and disappointing mouthfeel. I have had better from Dogfish Head."
"Drinkability: Easy like pie. But, why bother? I remembered this one being better the first time I had it, but even then, it was nothing to write home about. There are better DFHs out there, and much better Belgian Strong Darks."
"Despite all it's shortcomings, it's actually easy to drink owing to it's smooth mouthfeel and low carbonation. I can't normally stomach beers with this much fusel/acetone/isopropyl/solvent alcohol, but this doesn't seem to bother me. Again, it's my nasal congenstion, but the warming feeling is nice, and hey, it's opening my sinuses. I know, on any other day, the fusels would take off a point on taste, so I'll do that tonight despite the fact that my stuffy nose doesn't care. One bottle gives me a pleasant buzz on an empty stomach."
"Enjoyable."
"More of a novelty than something I'd drink regularly."
"Drinkability: Too drinkable, given the 8.0% abv."
"I noticed that some reviewers mentioned that this brew carried a pretty decent head, but mine made a quick and tiny appearance, a left immediately. I guess before I even start to explain my review, I must say that I reviewed it as a strong belgian dark ale, and this does not have the ideal characteristics of one that I have ever come across. It lacks the initial sweetness that I look for in a good belgian. One thing this beer does have on its side is a complexity of flavors hitting the mouth. From start to finish, you pick up many ""different"" flavors. The finish isn't bad, but not what a good strong belgian normally has. Overall, if this had not been labled a belgian strong dark ale (which happens to be one of my favorite styles), I may have reviewed it differently."
"Taste is of fruity sweet maltiness. Very sweet. Sticks to your whole mouth. Lightly bitter and raisin flavors. Spicy. Did I mention very sweet? Very still. Long sticky molasses and light bitter aftertaste. This is ambitious to be sure but just too sweet for me. Beyond that, a good beer."
"Notes: The apperance of this brew is the best part. To be honest, the head and color and lacing are not all that inpressive either. It's an 8%ABV, so I respect it. Money well spent if your looking for a clean buzz at a decent price from nice beer."
"Enough. This is certainly neither a disappointing, nor indeed any kind of negative experience. Someone with a steamy bowl of indian pudding with hard sauce or a slab of hot gingerbread might reach for this ale with flavors of Thanksgiving. It really seems like an old-fashioned flavor, and as I noted before, pretty darned unique."
"I found Raison to be a good beer but not a great beer. The color is a hazy ruby red to brown, which looks good. The head, though, was smaller than expected and disappeared quickly. I loved the way it smelled with the rummy, raisin aroma with a background of alcohol. The taste wasn't quite as good but still okay. Compared to other Belgian Dark Ales, it would not make the list of favorites. As a beer, it feels good in the mouth and was drinkable despite the 8% alcohol content. I know that this was supposed to be a Belgian Dark Ale, but it misses that mark somehow, even though the beer is good."
"Simply wonderful beer from DFH, easily a top five beer for me."
"Drinkability is ok, it gets a little better as it warms up a bit."
"Drinkability: Excellent drinkability...but watch the 8.0% ABV!"
"12oz Bottle packaged in Jan 03. Poured clear brownish orange with a head that thinned out quickly leaving barely a thin film. Aroma is slightly spicy and with sugar and raisins present. Belgian yeast also very evident in aroma. Crisply carbonated mouthfeel that is medium bodied and smooth. Alcohol goes undetected here in both aroma and flavor. Flavor is sugary sweet with notes of dried fruit. Very good flavors. Overall top notch Belgian style. One of the best American brewed in this style."
"Mahogany color with a light white head. The head fades and leaves little lace. The aroma is a bit sweet. Hints of candy come to mind with tones of malt in the background and fruit. The taste is a bit different from the aroma. There are more malt tone with a lightly fruit feel at the end and an ever so small flash of bitter finish. Another enjoyable beer from Dogfish Head."
"Over all not a bad brew, can see why it is 8% ABV. Cant say that it is one that I would go out of my way to get again. Interesting but not my cup of tea!"
"Took from a tulip. Orange clear to hazy robe with fizzy carbonation. Aroma is fruity (peaches and pears) and flowery hops -> Promising. In mouth, the body is medium, rather tongue cleaning. Respectable complexity, lots of yeasty fruitiness (pears, bananas, oranges) a bit like Dominus Vobiscum Ambrée, bready, malty and big notes of pepper reminiscent of Ambrel. I love most spiced ales I must say, but I didn't appreciate the finish of this one. Dry hoppiness seemed a bit off."
"Pours a dark reddish brown colour with an non-descript off white head that doesnt last but laces well. Smell is off dried fruits ( no surprise since its brewed with raisns) Taste starts off caramel like with notes of sweetness and more dried fruit. Hops arent strong, but slip in at the end to keep the beer from becoming a bit to cloying overall. Mouthfeel is a bit sweet and sticky but not overly so. Would be a really nice post dinner beer. Drinkability is good as the high alcohol never really shows its self. Not DFH best, but a pretty good beer that I had been putting off trying due to the ingredients listed on the bottle. I Hate Raisins."
"As the bottle states this is a deep mahogony brew. The head was there at first but died away after a minute or two. The smell is sweet with a bit of fruity hops. Taste is a bit like syrup and as sweet as it too. Big blend of fruits and dark strong malts. It seems to be a little blander than I was expecting. There is a sweet lingering aftertaste, I think that's just the syrup sticking to my tongue though. Not a bad beer but really nothing spectacular. The alcohol is well hidden so don't be fooled."
"A big thanks to noclueaboutbeer for hauling this one out to Kansas all the way from Connecticut."
"Personally, I think this is a nice DFH brew. I'm glad I tried it and plan to have some more!"
"This came out a thick reddish brown, topped with a strong head. Full, creamy mouthfeel, sweet and malty taste with hints of raisins and pineapple in the aroma. No noticeable traces of alcohol in the taste, despite its high abv. Overall, a wonderful beer that keeps pulling me back to it time and time again."
"This beer has a nice amber color. No substantial head. It's fruity with a slight alcohol smell. I found it to be very smooth, not bitter at all. It goes down a little too easy. It had a fruity flavor as well. The mouthfeel was light and the alcohol lingers a bit. I would definitely try another."
"surprises from the great beer brewers at Dogfish."
"Overall, this just wasn't one of Dogfish Head's better brews, IMO. There was no effort to disguise the alcohol content. If anything, it seemed to be amplified. That alone was enough for me to not want to try this brew more than once. A brew that's too off balance to be very appealing."
"poured a hazey cherry color with no head. The aromas were absent at first (too cold?) but with warming revealed green grass and sweet cooked carrots with a whiff of alcohol. The taste was unusual, like a dessert wine, but dryer with very little residual flavors after it passed my gullet. Overall I like DFH brews, but this one dissapointed."
"When I started my beer club, I was the novice of all novices when it came to beer. I did know that Dogfish Head Brewery was becoming more and more popular every day. I had no idea they offered so many kinds of beer. I picked up the Tackle Box to try some other kinds since I liked the porter so much and discovered that The Raison is not to be fooled with. It'll get you when your not looking. It poured out a nice dark brown in color. The nose was pretty sweet but it also smelled like it could have a bite. (and did) The head came and went rather quickly. You could definetly taste the green raisons which was much nicer than I thought. The flavor lingered long after swallowing. This beer definetly need a warning on the label. Dennis Learey would say the label should read, ""Don't make any f@#%ing plans!"""
"You gotta hand it to the boys at DFH for trying new things. Sometimes they may go a bit too far, and I think this is one of those occasions. It is not a bad beer, but its novelty wears off quickly. Pours a medium brown with zero head. And I mean zero. Smell is of raisons and alcohol. Taste is pretty much the same. Very sweet. At first the melding of the raisons and the belgian beer sugars is interesting, but eventually it kinda overpowers your taste buds. The alcohol is very evident... not bad on a cold winters day, however. This stuff I've found is better on tap. Out of the bottles its just too syrupy."
"This one pours a ruby woody crimson color with a small head that fades abruptly. The color is one I have never seen before but it sure looks pretty. Lots of bubbles racing to the top on this beer. The smell is really strong with alcohol and has a slight brown sugary sweetness. The taste is malt heavy on top. It's sweet but not residually sweet. Maybe thats the belgian beet sugars coming into play. There's a base of caramel malt in here also but it only hints at coming out never really becoming a strong flavor. Alcohol is present the whole time and becomes exceedingly strong towards the end. Belgian yeast provides a slight offset to the alcohol but not enough and is different in its own right. The body is rather thin, maybe because of strong alcohol precense or lack of carbonation, and it's not the smoothest beer. But the complexity and originality of this beer make it something unusual and well worth trying. What style is this anyways?"
"Pours somewhat hazy maroon with gold highlights and a minor head with some lace. Aroma has a yeasty, bread-like smell to accompany mild dark fruits. Candy sugar is very dominant in the taste. Malty but with a yeasty tint, almost Tripple-like quality as far as mouthfell goes. Hint of alocohol and sweetness on the finish. Very nice beer."
"The beer pours a hazy redish color with a lacey white head. The aroma is quite plain. There is a bit of malt scent and a little belgian yeast aroma. The taste is excellent. It is sweet and a bit tart. It has a nice malt flavor and raisin taste. This is a good beer no doubt. The mouthfeel is good. It is a medium bodied beer with good carbonation. This beer is an awesome drinker. Another great beer from Dogfish Head."
"pours a cloudy amber colour with an off-white head that has minimal stickiness to it. the smell here is rather nice. it is mainly earthy with rasin, malt, hop and wood notes throughout. the taste is similar to the smell but a bit sweeter, which is a welcome touch. there is a bitter/sour-ish finish here that is also slightly dry at the same time. a different take on the style but enjoyable nonetheless. nothing overwhelmingly good but solid overall."
"Drinkability  Very drinkable example of the style. The emphasis on fruits and the rather strong alcohol taste didnt bother me at all, but others may find it a bit too much."
"Drinkability: Straight marks. A good choice if you're looking for a one-off ale to think about while sipping, as opposed to a session."
"I have been curious about this beer. I am not a fan of Belgian-style beers but have heard good things about this beer. It is good but not anything to write home about. There is a sweet aroma that is very much in tune with the name. There is no head. The taste is somewhat layered with lots of fruitiness and maltiness. There is a citrus undertone that is quite a balance with the sweetness. The beer's alcohol content is warming and cheerful. That is the strong point, and that is not much of one. I won't seek this one out again but would choose it over many other things."
"The first few times I had this, it was almost undrinkable. I can now appreciate the flavor more, although the strong, unbalanced alcohol still detracts from the taste of the green raisins. An interesting beer and definitely worth trying, but not something I see myself going back to frequently."
"Definitely an interesting and complex beer. The beet sugar, while strange, proves to be tasty. The beer is certainly drinkable, although I don't think I could drink more than a couple pints before wanting to switch it up to something else."
"Slightly hazy copper-amber pour topped off with a small amount of brown foam. Thick, rich smell with notes of caramelized brown sugar. The substantial alcohol content is detectable in the nose as well, though not offensively. An interesting combination of taste and mouthfeel--silky sweet malts at the onset with a taste that thins out (bringing the alcohol to great prominence) while a powdery texture remains. The texture and chocolately notes are vaguely reminiscent of a glass of cocoa. This is the first Dogfish offering I've had that I would buy again."
"Cheers"
"I could take or leave it, but I wouldn't buy again."
"One of the best damn Belgian...er...American beers I've ever had!"
"A good one by Dog Fish Head. It was a nice amber color with a sweet aroma- almost too sweet I thought. It tasted good, sweet again but too sweet, a touch of spice, and some fruitiness. And I did taste that 'sense of purpose' that it's brewed with! The mouthfeel was not too thick or too thin, which I like in a beer. I dont like to feel like I might have to chew it, and if I had more than one at the time I drank it, I would've had more- great drinkability."
"This beer pours with a very nice deep ruby color with a light tan head. Aromas of smokey, dark fruit, leather and wood, oh yeah, throw in some alcohol into the mix. It has a full sweet body that finishes alcohol dry. Flavors of caramel, raisins, and even some ripe plums. It has almost a red wine aged in oak thing going for it. A nice, interesting brew."
"Pours a one-fingered white head leaving a good lace, Nice amber color. Very good carbonation. Sweet raisin nose. Starts sweet - mouthfeel is fizzy and finish is somewhat dry but good. The high ABV is not noticeable so be wary of this. A very good spiced beer."
"Aroma of dried apricots and raisins raised expectations, but initial mouthful was of carbonation, hops,and yeast. Better let this one warm up a bit. Somewhat nicer nearer room temperature, but just not my style. Bitter aftertaste left me disappointed that I've got 5 more of these to cellar."
"I like it."
"Wow, this brew definitely took me off guard. I like the fact these guys take chances and are always trying new combinations (and they are local) but this one was a little to rough for my taste. The appearance was a deep mahogany color and the pour did not produce much of a head. A clingy lace hung down the glass till the bitter (and I mean bitter) end. A heavy scent of raison, figs, etc... were a change for me but overall it was a little heavy handed for me --- the ABV was way high and actually took over the taste of the brew overall. I couldn't drink a lot of this, but every once in a while on a cold winter night, this could be a good companion."
"The beer seems to me to be seriously underrated by many of the other writers here, but here goes, anyway. Appearance: Reddish orange, clear, prominent head which leaves some very nice lace. Smell: Sweet, some fruitness and spiciness from the fermentation. Flavor: Very smooth. There is a complex flavor, with a mixture of malty, spiciness, the sugars and raison add up the a dense mixture of dates, figs, and fruitcake like flavors, but the overall effect is clean and uncluttered, amazingly enough. I remember this beer when it first came out, and it was quite tasty but much rougher than it is now. It is clearly a model in eccentric brewing these days. The mouthfeel is smooth and creamy, and the overall drinkability is very high."
"I genuinely like and appreciate this beer."
"This one kind of grew on me as I drank it. Maybe this is so because it warmed slightly? Nah, probably just the alcohol talking. Raison Detre is certainly an interesting brew. Would rate higher if it could hide its 8.0% better."
"Aroma was malty but dominated by alcohol. I couldn't make out any Belgian beet sugars, green raisins (or sense of purpose). The taste of the beer was also dominated by alcohol. Not particularly flavourful. Came across as quite astringent. Reminded me some of taking a mouthful of cocoa powder. Too dry and too alcohol harsh."
"The nose is heavily caramel malt and this carries in to the sweet malt flavor that is dedicated fairly substantially to the sweet side of beer. Notes of pungent fruitiness seem to also come through here, perhaps a bit like dried friuts such as apple. The alcohol is noticeable and also limits, to some degree, the drinkability."
"Had this in the 12oz bottle. Pours a red/brown color with a nice moderate head that leaves a little lacing on the glass. The aroma was sweet and the raisins were the most obvious part of it. The flavor was reeeaaaly sweet. It was a little malty and hoppy, but not very carbonated. The alcohol is very present in the taste, but the sweetness seems to take a little off of the 'kick' that it would normally give. Not a bad beer, but a little too sweet for my taste buds."
"Ommegang and Hair of the Dog. I can't wait to try Worldwide Stout."
"Looks like a nice mahogany almost a little redish color with a little head. It had a little fruity smell that seemed to be raisins maybe even a little sweet smell to it. It had a nice taste of fruit and a little caramel. You can taste the malts and hops but neither is to overpowering. It was not overly carbonated. The high ABV could turn some people off but it does not bother me. It is a very interesting beer. Its hard to describe but not really my favorite. I would say that this beer is kind of like a Belgian but at the same time its not."
"Had this on tap at the CTRiver brewers festival. It is a bit of mahogany in color. Much more head than in the bottled version. Head Ligners for awhile. Inhale this and WOW! Big nose very remenicent of a Belgian Strong. Sweet, strong nose. Very Aromatic. The taste is very sweet also. Caramel & fruit. This is a definite keeper. Not quite sure how this is listed in the Belgian Strong Style. There are some similarities, but I'm not sure what style I would classify it as. Still a very hard one to beet!"
"ng"
"Drinkablilty: I found this beer slightly better than average but not great. I think i will try it again down the road and see how my thoughts change."
"An initially vinous nose turns into rubbing alcohol as it warms. You can smell the grape/raisin fruit as well as other sugary fruits. Carmel melds with fruit and sugar to form a tantilzing dessert-like sweetness. Very silky to the tongue with light carbonation -- there really was almost no head on this beer except with a brutally aggressive pour. Alcohol gets obvious pretty fast. Aftertaste has an odd, almost-roasted bitterness that sweeps up everything but a barely lingering SunMaid raisin kick. Tossing any notion of style into the wind, I think this may be a bit of a love/hate beer. It's unique, and the alcohol is a bit noticeable. But it's interesting, flavorful, and aromatic -- and that counts for a lot in my book."
"Notes: A good beer to try. But not one of my favorites. Definately a sign of why Dogfish Head is a popular brewery, because they aren't afraid to take a risk or two."
"Deep Brown color, small head. "" A deep mahogany ale, brewed with Belgian beet sugars, green raisins and a sense of purpose.."". Full-bodied Belgian style ale. Deep, intense malt flavors. Not too hoppy. Belgian sugars are very evident. Complex flavor. Mellowing taste. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is malty. Some alcohol bite. Interesting beer. Well deserved of its notoriety."
"It drinks okay. Nothing special. Easy to drink down."
"This is a very interesting beer because it's not exactly trying to be any one style. It's very malty, raisiny, and has the belgian yeast flavor, but isn't trying to be a belgian. It's just a smooth, wonderfully flavorful, malty, fruity, balanced beer that's addicting to drink. A must try."
"Mouthfeel is a bit heavy. Any brew with an ABV this high deserves respect and caution."
"Overall Impression: Overall it's a really nice beer. It's flavors are full and subdued at the same time, if that's possible. I'd like to see more head on it. I don't know if DFH does this, but a bottle-conditioned corked 750ml version would be out of this world!"
"Pours a fairly clear chestnut color with a creamy light tan head that quickly fades into a thin and patchy lace. Nose is candied sugar, sweet grain, light chocolaty malts, rum-soaked raisins, and a bit of spicy alcohol. Moderate in body and slightly syrupy in texture. Taste begins quite sweet with flavors of brown sugar and lots of roasted malt. However, even with the strong malt presence, its not quite enough to counterbalance the intense winey alcohol that follows with notes of raisins and tawny port with a bite of peppery spice in the finish. Of course, a beer need not necessarily be balanced to be enjoyable. An intense and very complex beer. Thanks to faernt for the sample!"
"Dark copper color with a beige foamy head that runs away quickly. Aroma is plentiful - sweet and rich, with malt, fruit and alcohol. Flavor likewise is rich and sweet. Tastes malty with hints of apricot and honey, and a bit of yeast. Mouthfeel is lacking. It's slick and watery with low carbonation. Drinkability is on the low side due to the overly sweet flavor and unappealing mouthfeel."
"Color is deep, deep reddish brown of mahoganey, slow carbonation bubbles flowing within its dark center. Finger high head of ivory colored tight froth that faded fast and leaves lots of tiny stringed lace. Aroma is a malty light caramel and dark fruit ensemble of softness - raisin, plum, and apricot with a fairly solid amount of alcohol in the nose as well. Taste is smoothly subtle and calm with an easy caramel malt start that flows into the dark fruits of mostly plum and raisin, slight molasses and banana, notes of cinnamon and sugared beets. Finish is a nice candy sweetness of caramel and yes, more raisins, quite nice in its subtlities throughout each sip. Smooth, light creamy body feel with a small warming alcohol kick in the finish. I really liked the subltities in the flavors of this beer but lacks in richness and some bolder character in the feel and smell. Its quite good none the less; and enjoyable in my book."
"Nice and creamy, loved it, I'll try another some day, I suppose!"
"Taste is first and foremost highly fermented sugars, with an almost syrupy note of raisins. Belgian-style yeast makes itself known with moderate ester flavor. There is little traditional malt nor hop flavor to this, only raisins, sugars (from beets, according to the label), yeasty, fruity esters, and alcohol. More of a high-potency liquid candy than a normal beer, this demands respect and slow sipping."
"All in all, Id chalk this one up as Dogfish having pushed the envelope a little too far beyond the beer boundaries and into the experimental, novelty category. The concept is way more intriguing than the flavor. The beer finishes long, fluffy, slightly sour and fake. It tastes exactly like Id expect a beer with a large percentage of non-malt fermentables would tastecidery (again). Oh well, theres still the continuously hopped beers."
"Overall, it's not it my top *top* list, but among the leaders in my 'Above Average' category."
"This particular brew poured a small white head with small bubbles. The body was mahogany in color and there was no lacing on the sides of my glass. I sensed an aroma of raisins with this brew and the flavor had a hint of smoke. All in all, not a bad drink."
"Not my favorite Dogfish Head, but I certainly wouldn't kick her out of bed."
"Poured a deep copper color with slight head that was gone quickly,the aroma was complex almost meaty with slight sugary notes.Taste was somewhat fruity,like others i do pick up some grape-like flavors,with some sweet alcohol flavors rounding this one out.A very complex beer kinda hard to rate,I would try again,would love to find on tap."
"This brew poured a small head of fine to mediumly sized off white bubbles and a transparent brown body. With a very mild malt aroma, the flavors and plalate of this brew are definately its stongest points. The flavor is very complex with notes of spice, roasted caramel, malt, sugar sweetness and a noticeable alcohol content. It has a good mouthfeel with a lingering tongue numing sensation."
"I had this one in a 12oz. bottle poured into a pint glass. It pours a deep copper color with 1 finger of head that dies quickly. There is no lacing left on the glass. The smell is a mix of grapes and hops. Without the hops, it would smell just like wine. The taste is a bit of fruit and spice. There is just a little bit of hops. This is a fairly sweet brew. The mouthfeel is very thick. The drinkability is also fair for being 8%."
"A very enjoyable ale that is interesting enough to keep you on your toes but is not overly complex or earth shattering."
"This is Dogfish Head's attempt to do a Dubbel. I enjoyed this one and think that it's one of the better Belgian-styles produced in America, and hope to see DFH do more!"
"This brew pours darker than I was exspecting almost pitch black. Has a small head that subsided rather quickly. This beer is supposed to be reminicent of a Beligium I have heard but I do not think that is the case. Still, I did not think this beer was as ""off"" as other reviewers have commented. A rather unique flavor to this one, definately some raison notes as well as some dark malt flavor to this beer. Alcohol is there and this is not a beer that I would session because, unlike many beers even of this abv, it felt heavy to me. A good beer...not a great beer."
"Brought back from Chicago by trbeer. 12 fl. oz. bottle. Pours copper in color with very little head. Aroma smells of pistachios. Taste also reminds me of pistachios and small hops contribution. I just have pistachios on the brain for this review. I won't have a chance to re-review since this isn't sold in Michigan. I do get some some of nutty flavor though. Slight vegetable taste - from beet sugars?"
"Very raisony and fruity yet spicy with a mild bitterness. This beer pours great with a light head. The aroma is almost overwhelming with a slight bit of hops but mainly a sweet and fruit smell. The raisons and beet sugar really come out in the flavor that is sweet, earthy, spicy and mildly bitter. the first drink is spicy at the begining but this soon dies and you are left with almost a carbonated fruit juice type drink (but in a good way). Overall a really good sipping beer."
"this is a pretty beer in my opinion. it's got nice brown color with pale quarter inch head. It's smells like no beer i've ever encountered. there is a heavy raisin smell, almost like grape juice. i think there are some other fruity smells in there, but i can't identify them. It's taste is what i would expect from the smell of it. it tastes like a beer/wine hybrid almost. the raisins are again apparent along with some sweet malt flavor. the 8% alcohol is masked well as it does not taste that strong. it has a slight coffee/chocolatey finish. it's mouth feel is nice and pretty thick. overall a decent beer, but nothing i'm going to run out and get again right away."
"This one poured to a deep copper/rubyish color with a creamy tan head. It left behind a great deal of lace when I sipped it down. I found the smell to be wonderful. It was very raisiny, with hints of chocolate and caramel malts. The flavor was sweet, caramely, and raisiny. It is a smooth beer, medium-full in body with a slight alcoholic warmth. Another great offering from Dogfish Head."
"The taste is slightly sweet, and has a bitter finish. It leaves my mouth all fizzy and tingly. I can taste the hops, but not as much of the malty sticky sweetness I remember from the cask. Maybe when I went to the bathroom the beer troll came and took a piss in my bottle. Don't get me wrong, it still tastes good, just not nearly as good as I remember. I'll have to try it on tap again next time I see it."
"Originally sampled 28 September 2002. Loved it. Beautiful mahogany color w/ a unique taste that I can't quite place. I'm sure glad that I can now get this locally!! In a follow on tasting, I served it in a stemmed, tulip shaped glass rather than a pint glass. Wow, it improved the nose tremendously (OK, I don't have a great sense of smell). Got definite whiffs of baking chocolate w/ a hint of cinnamon. The upfront taste was slightly sweet w/ a smooth finish."
"The taste is very pleasant. Fruity, malty, and slightly warm with alcohol. Very similar in many respects to a barleywine, but not quite as spicy. Has a nice amount of chew to it, and becons for another sip."
"I had the 20 percent Raison D' extra version once and that was one isanely sweet, strong and syrupy concoction. This is like a mini version of that beer."
"The ingrediants were a little scary. Green raisons? Was this some kind of ""French"" comspiracy? I poured the beer and noted it's red amber color. What happened to the green raisons. The taste was indeed bold. Fruity, but not tooty-fruity. Good hops playing out. A definite well rounded beer."
"A pet peeve from reading other reviews- the spelling of raisin... the dried fruit ends with -in. Raison is NOT fruit, it's the French/Freedom word for reason, as in ""Raison d'etre"" -""Reason for Being"" It's fun wordplay on a number of levels, but it's not how to spell the word that describes the fruit."
"Perfect head, but it pops down a little too quickly.... haven't even smelled it yet. Nice medium-colored amber. OK, ready to smell it (head's gone completely except a tiny bit) Smells fruity, but not just of raisons. A nice bouquet, but a little ambiguous and light. very pleasant taste, Can taste the raisons, but it's not too much. Feels very nice on the palate. And it leaves me wanting more... very rich. While the taste is pretty good, as long as you keep drinking more, it's very good!"
"I enjoyed this beer a lot. Pours somewhat of a mahogany color with a fluffy off-white head that dies down, leaving a stick lace. Aromas are sweet with raisins and plums with moderate hoppy undertones. The taste is quite sweet, bursting with the sweetness of raisins and caramel. The taste of alcohol was strong, but not to bad. Finish was light and dry. This is another great beer from the folks at DFH."
"Ok, here we go...this has a massive long-lasting light beige head upon pouring, settling over clear dark amber fluid w/gold highlights. The nose is grapey and quite fruity...interesting. Tasting reveals lots of sweetness, with a green apple-like note followed by slight slight raisin flavors, then a healthy maltiness picks up. Fruity flavors then become apparent with alcohol esters close behind. Just a minimum of hopping here. Finishes dry and strong/warming. One interesting and funky beer, this one is! Would I purchase a six-pack of this anytime soon? I'd say nyet!"
"Sometimes, even great chefs lose or forget the basic principles of blending and pairing ingredients. They get off-track and begin to throw ingredients together with no apparent direction in mind. Such is the case with the brewmaster of Raison D'Etre. While not a bad beer, it's clear that this is an experimental concoction. The deep amber color with red tint would be improved with any sign of a lasting head. The full malt body is sweetened beyond any reasonable expectation. ""Oh Boy, Green Raisins! Extra Sugar (""maybe this will help", yum!) ""Let's pour some alcohol into the brew to appeal to the street people!"" The aroma is sweet and alcoholic. This is an experiment best abandoned!"
"Strange brew, but none the less a intriguing one to try. Cloudy orange in appearence with some white head and a fair amount of lacing as well. It smelled very deep with hints of currant and rum. The taste was green raisons as the bottle purported, but I think the green I tasted was an unripe one. The beer was also particularly syrupy. Cannot say that this beer is my reason for being, but I think that maybe all beer is."
"The kind of beer that one is glad to have tasted; not sure I will stand in line to buy it again. Over the top."
"In all, like a toned down triple with more hearty ale-like features: same fruity and floral hop characteristics mixed with a strong earthy side peppery yeast and woody malts. Interesting, but I wouldn't get it again until they've mastered how to mix this experiment with the ratio of it many parts."
"thanks to frank4sail for the sample!"
"I'd buy it again. Not because it is a beer I love, but because of its innovation and mystery."
"F."
"This beer is wierd one, even by dogfish head standards. It truly tastes like ""golden delicious"" apples. Aroma is nice & malty but a sip reveals the fruitiness of this beer. It's not overbearing by any means but there's not much else going on here so the appple taste stands out. This beer is warm going down....nice. easy to drink but I don't think I'd want more than one of these. A nice novelty but not something i'd get down with."
"Anytime I see the huge Dogfish Head tap handle, I have to try it. This beer was an inviting amber brown, complemented by a decent white head. The first thing in the aroma that stood out was the fruit aroma (apples and raisins) along with some traces of mellow spice. The taste is the texture of a fine spiced rum, and there are also hints of the flavor in the brew. Very complex, yet utterly enjoyable, and refreshing. The high ABV of course gives the flavor a little bite, and there is also some candi sugar thrown in here for more sweetness. Alot of malt makes this a treat, along with a good medium body and a somewhat chewy texture. Drinkability is good, but it would be better if this weren't so drinkable with 8% abv one is enough. Not quite over the top like some of the Dogfish Head beers, but not a disappointment by any means. I did enjoy her."
"I really enjoyed this brew, obviously alot more than some of my fellow BA's. The beer pours reddish copper with a thin off-white head and no lacing. There is little or no visible carbonation. The smell is of some fruit with clear malt flavors. The flavor was malty as well, but with some sweet fruit characteristsics as well. I don't know that I rate malty brews so high, this may be the highest malty brew I have rated. I just found it to be highly drinkable and enjoyable for a high ABV brew with some experimental characteristics."
"Initial taste is very sweet and caramelized. Then it's toasty, raisin sweetness of course, and a hint of chocolate as well. Alcohol is noticeable but not bothersome. The finish is dry and just slightly bitter, leading to a long and enjoyable sweet aftertaste. A six pack of this beer could last me a week or longer because I didn't find it too easy to drink one right after the other. The richness is fulfilled in my stomach after one, as well as 8% ABV taking effect. Overall, it's a very tasty beer that I will buy again as a dessert beer."
"A relatively attractive beer--Rich light brown with copper hue. Quick disapating off white head is poured. Very light carbonation and slightly gummy body. Aroma is very musty and not very alluring. Flavor is disapointing too. No balance of flavors or much a direction to style either. What style is this? Dogfish has successfully pushed the limits of a beer style before but alas, they failed here. Rough malt flavors and some flavor reminscent of a bad cheap white wine in there, but nothing to make the drinker want another. With that in mind Im gonna have a Bigfoot to cap off my evening..."
"The label makes a claim of being mahogany in colour. This is a pretty good comparison, although I might be drawn more towards a lighter-coloured indian rosewood. Head is off-white, and well-proportioned. Very nice to look at. The nose brings out typical strong Belgian ale aromas, with a light pungent sourness. Taste is very malty (nice!), sweet, with again a little sourness which goes over well. I also thought I could detect the raisins in the finish. A very well made beer: Is this truly Dogfish Head's Raison D'etre?? (rough translation: ""reason of being"")"
"Not a bad beer, but a bit of a one note beer."
"This Belgian specialty had a clear orange appearance with noticeable bands of carbonation. A decent foamy head topped the glass, but I was somehow not as impressed with the visuals here. The smell was very malty sweet, with a touch of alcohol scent. After a while I did notice a fruity, raisin-like smell, as mentioned on the label. Nice complexity. The taste surprised me somewhat. The expected maltiness was there, but the alcohol and an indescribable furity / smoked taste battled for my attention. Also very complex and hard to isolate the flavors. I see why this is labeled a Belgian specialty ale...rather uncharacteristic, but not bad. Very dry taste at the end, too. The mouthfeel was pretty average for the style, though...medium body with a nice tingle, but nothing little else worth mentioning. This is an interesting Belgian derivative that is worth trying. I doubt I'll clamor for it in the near future, but I wouldn't refuse it, either."
"Reddish brown pour. Malty sweet nose, maybe some alcohol on the nose. Taste is very complex - sweet, then bitter, slight alcohol in there, too. Too many different flavors to pick them all out. Maybe more like a wine or brandy than beer, in terms of complexity."
"Cheers"
"This is a beer with barely any carbonation whatsoever. If I'm drinking a barley-wine or a more full bodied beer, I don't mind that, but this is just weird. I like the fact that like all Dogfish brews, this one doesn't easily fit into any category, but the sample case I bought was very disappointing. Hopefully some day I can get some 90 min IPA or WWS to change my mind, but the Tackle Box sampler is wack. The Raison is cloyingly sweet. Smells weird and as the name would suggest, tastes like raisins. Anyway, it's worth a try, but I won't be buying it again."
"appearance was a rich golden amber with a small bubble bone white head poured rather aggressive, head depleted rather fast. the aroma was of malt, floral hop and champaigne (sp). the taste was so sweet. warming malt and super complex. fruity, sour apple mixed with grapes and raisin. bitter hop bite. it was of medium body with a long lasting fruit aftertaste. alcohol is present as it warms."
"Beautiful copper-orange color with amber highlights. This beer pours with a one-inch, light tan head that fades to a thin foamy film. The aroma is a little bit of sweetness mingled with some herbal and woody notes. Interesting, bordering on weird. The taste is also odd. The main taste is hard to pinpoint, but it is essentially a woody, slightly smoky malt taste. Throw in a pinch of herbal tea and a splash of vodka to get the idea of this taste. It's not bad, just odd. There seems to be a bit of spice in there as well, but it's hard to pinpoint. Soke residual sweetness on the finish, with just a touch of bitterness. The mouthfeel is very full and smooth. The alcohol warms a bit as it goes down, like a good smooth bourbon. The drinakbility is average due to the odd yet complex flavor profile. In general I like the Dogfish line, but this one is a bit too odd for someone as conservative as me."
"This beer is different and I seemed to like it less the second time I had it and now more the third time.[ I think I have made up my mind] Some decent sweet matly flavors brought on by beet sweetness and raisons. The second time i had it I did poor this beer out of a cold fridge and never let it get to a good temp so the flavors seemed separate. When served right It has a velvety mouthfeel with great fine carbonation the really slamms the flavors into your bud's. Over all I like this beerjust fine and will drink it occassionaly but for all the hype and $10 a six pack it won't make the regular rotation."
"Deep clear brown in color, has a small fizzy off white head, smokey sweet brown sugar and caremel malty aroma. Chocolate fruity caremel flavors, has some sour bitterness. Medium body, has somewhat of a syrupy mouthfeel, well hidden alcohol content, good and different."
"A very nice beer... I want another! Hope I can find it again."
"the beer is very smooth with carbonation in check. the body is medium with nice rich consistency. the malts are arranged well, and it is very easy to drink. you will get flavors of caramel, alcohol, and raisons. yes definitely raisons. i didn't expect this, but it was a really unique characteristic. definitely a new experience."
"Quite Good in a Weird Way actually."
"I got a six pack and was excited to try this. As much as I wanted to like it, I just can't. It poured a dark rich amber with very little head. The aroma was a mix of raisons and alcohol - they don't mix well. It tasted of malt and raisons with a creamy alcohol finish. I didn't like the raisons and I didn't like the alcohol taste. I'm going to age these a few months and hope they improve. On the plus side, one beer at 8% did give me a buzz on an empty stomach."
"Specialty beer, indeed. It's a nice brownish red with a smallish head. The smell is funky-fruit with a trace of hops and definitely unique. Green raisins? It sounds odd, but it works. The fruity flavor dominates, but it doesn't overwhelm the beer. The smell and taste of alcohol are noticeable but appropriate for an 8.0% abv beer. The drinkability is good, although this is certainly not a session beer. It seems to be a love it or hate it beer."
"Taste has some malt character, but sadly there are not many hops to be found. Smooth mouthfeel backed with a kick of alcohol that is quite warming and pleasant, with a bit of a dry finish. Has kind of a cheap beer flavor to it, and unfortunately it almost tastes like a fine malt liquor. Anyone seen a 40 oz of this around? ;)"
"Drinkability: Well...it's not a bad beer. The flavor is certainly interesting, but I don't see myself coming back to this one. To me, this is one of those 'try it once and move on' beers."
"Time and again, I turn folks on to incredible beer like this and they are amazed that there's great beer coming out of Kalamazoo or Pennsylvania or Delaware. Proof again that ""you can search the world over and never find a better beer"" than those made by craft brewers here in the U.S.A."
"Tried this brew and was not that impressed. The bouquet was heavy with solvent alcohol. The deep color was attractive but the taste was not that appealing. Interesting but not very appealing. The bitterness was appropriate and was followed by a strong and warm alcohol finish. The sample I tasted had virtually no head. It was not at all reminiscent of Belgians I have tasted which were all lively and bubbly. I would not buy more of this flavor."
"The taste and flavor is a complex arrangement of specialty malts followed by fruit and spice and finishing with a warmth of alcohol from the beet sugars. The alcohol stays with you long after the last sip. This makes for a very nice after dinner ale. This is also a nice sitting around the fire after long winter day ale. As the label states this ale has ""a sense of purpose""."
"I couldn't get excited about this beer. Everything is there but not put together in a sophisticated fashion. Deep copper color, and a non-existent head. Nose is sweet and phenolic with some fruitiness. The taste is one dimensional, a bit grapey but nothing jumps out to grab your attention. A wouldn't call this a Belgian style, the complex yeast notes and intense flavors just aren't there. It didn't improve with warming either."
"Yeah!!! Very nice stuff. The only downer was it maintained zero head, beautiful mahogany colour. Lots of raisins, caramel, touch of port and some smoke. Palate is complex round, raisiny, port-like, toasty, oaky, spicy, with some peppery alcohol in the finish, very resiny, oily, creamy and round, lots of flavours to describe in this one, excellent stuff"
"This beer poured a dark reddish color and formed a small bubbly white head that didn't hold and left little lace.  Some carbonation present.  An aroma of caramel and other candy frangrances.  Flavor of caramel and raisins with a slight hint of the alcohol present.  A good beer, but not a traditional style belgian.  Typical Dogfish experimenting."
"Thanks to NeroFiddled for hooking me up"
"The last line on the label says ""brewed with a sense of purpose."" Well the purpose is to make me happy! Pours a dark mahogany color with a limited head that leaves patchy lace. First aroma is of fruits, not sweet, not sour. A taste of Belgian candy, alcohol, and a crisp finish. For an 8% ale, very drinkable. Excellent ale."
"I picked up a six-pack of this beer with high hopes, based on a friend's recommendation and the great reviews that it had received.  Nice mahogany color.  Thin head dissipated quickly.  At room temperature aroma has hints of carmel and raisin.  Initial bland fruit taste surronds then is swept away by overpowering alcohol flavor.  Combination of carbonation and  alcohol tingles the tongue.  Complex finish gives the ale its ""sense of purpose"" as the label states.  Flavor definitely seems to improve as the beer warms to room temperature.  This is the first Dogfish Head brew that I've tried and it has taken 2 separate attempts at drinking it to warm up to it."
"Deep burgundy color, thin beige head. Lots of rich warm smells of rum cake. Candied fruit apples and raisons are very noticable. Taste is smooth, sweet, and very inviting. Bready flavor matched with nice warming alcohol. Taste is much of liquid rum soaked raison bread. Very smooth, and rich going down, but also matched with a slippery candy, syrupy feeling. HIgh abv does catch up with you. One of these a night. This was a much anticipated beer, had multiple samples at the 2002 GABF."
"As the bottle states, this is a deep mahogany beer, to which I cannot disagree.  Rather attractive in the glass, the nose is bread-like with hints of caramel and a bit of mustiness, which seems both promising and forboding.  As could be expected from a beer of 8% abv, alcohol plays strongly in the flavor.  Unfortunately, the alcohol was a bit too strong on the opening of the flavor, rather than rounding it out with some warmth.  Once past the alcohol, candy sugars dominate with the green raisins surfacing nicely to give some identifiable flavor to the otherwise anonymous swetnesss.  Not quite as much body as anticipated but decent warmth due to the alcohol.  Undoubtedly some credit is due for a bit of uniqueness, but I felt the alcohol could stand to be tamed a bit.  Didn't find myself longing for another."
"I've never had ""rum soaked raisins"" but have probably used the description in past reviews.  After this beer I can more confidently say that I've actually had them.  Other than that, it seemed a little flat and alcohol-laden to me, but it was fun to drink one of them."
"Not too bad, you just have to remember that it is 8.0% abv and not to suck it down like any other beer that is on-tap."
"Garnet hue w/ good clarity, topped by a quickly dissapating head.  No lace is left.  Leafy tobacco & raisiny, dark caramel Special B (and / or real raisins?) sweetness in aroma.  Light acetaldehyde as well.  Deeply caramelized sweetness hits the palette initially, but vinous flavors & mild bubblegum esters quickly follow.  A bit cidery from the dark candi sugar in the grist. Hop bitterness is mild, but manages to offset the relatively high residual sweetness.  Lightly bodied, w/ a mouthfeel that borderlines on being thin.  Finishes clean, dry w/ a fading molasses flavor.  Although a tasty brew, I was expecting greater complexity and richness.  Raison D'etre is without flaws, however."
"An incredible beer. Pours out to a darker than expected amber with a slight head. Smell is that of fruit. The taste is fantastic. Fruit and licorice seem prevelant and the alcohol is hidden quite well. As it warms up, it gets better."
"An unusual and interesting beer, but then aren't all of the Dogfish Head beers? It took a long time for this beer to grow on me. It pours a deep crimson-mahogany with a creamy light tan head that drops quickly to just a collar (probably from the high alcohol). I like the aroma of dark caramels (toffee) and fruit. The flavor offers up a lot of alcohol, some dark fruity (raisins) maltiness, and some balancing bitterness. The flavor is actually quite toasty with a fig-like fruitiness. The finish is dryish and not nearly as complex as the flavor but does have a lingering sweet raisin-like note that's quite nice. The high level of alcohol is quite hidden. Overall, this is an expansive beer that doesn't reveal itself at first and deserves some extra attention and a few re-visits. It's a beer that I drink when I know I'm not having another but I still want something unusual and rich. Very well done and certainly worth a try. I've also noticed that this ages exceptionally well with bottles that are at least 6 months old becoming much smoother, and bottles that are a year or more old revealing a deeper character."
"I find it to be overly sweet with brown sugar and raisin flavors that don't blend well with the alcohol flavors. I will say that this is a well crafted and complex beer, but all the different flavors just don't seem to come together. That makes me 0 for 2 with Dogfish Head. BTW, it totally ruined the flavor of the nice Cuban I was smoking."
"I was really blown away by this. I guess it is considered a Belgian Ale, although it does not taste much like Chimay or the others. I actually like this a bit better than the usual Belgians. It is very full, somewhat heavy, and awesome all around! The smell is that of raisins and a touch of alcohol (but not overpowering). The taste is bold and fruitlike (raisins, currants). The alcohol comes through in the taste but in all the right places. Exceptional beer!!!"
"I drank this in contrast to the Chimay Red I tried tonight. Less of the Y-grass/raw carrot taste than the chimay, but more of the raisony flavor a lot of belgians have. Perhaps because I also drank the World Wide Stout on the same tasting, I also noticed a lot more caramelly/toffeeish flavors than in a typical belgian. I like the dark malt flavors in this beer. Makes for a nice twist on a Belgian. Palate still heavily carbonated, but less fuzzy than chimay. This beer is also more ruby and less brown than the Chimay."
"Clear, deep-brown color, controlled 1/2 inch head.  Aroma is a little fruity, touch of sharpness approaching skunk.  Dense initial mouthfeel, lower carbonation.  Sweet and just a touch of raisin and other dried fruit flavors.  Actually, more of a plum taste in some ways.  Hops are reserved to my tongue.  Nice mixture of robustness and lack of greasy slickness.  Sturdy without being heavy or overly fruity.  Alcohol content was pretty unnoticed by me until close to the end.  Cool brew, quality.  Thanks to Bighuge for dropping off a sixer."
"This brew pours pretty dark.  Dark Ruby.  Has a thin laced tan head that laces nicely.  Interesting aroma.  Like brown sugar and rock candy. Some malt tones too.   Nice.   This beer has some definite sweet tones mixed in with alcohol.  It's a nice taste.  Rock candy comes to mind again. An undenying sweet flavor.   Some lingering alcohol and bitterness on the tongue.  Body is medium to full.  Nice brew here."
"Something completely different. Poured from the bottle to not much head. Chemical fruit aroma, like cherry cough syrup. You can smell the alcohol. Initially like wine, then chocolatey sweet, fruity but an alarming finish - incredibly bitter. Cleans out the back of the throat as it goes down. I'm getting very medicinal qualities from this. The alcohol is blatant. I like this beer, I admire this beer... True, I wouldn't want to drink more than one at a time, but hey, this is art, right?"
"Very different on tap than in the bottle.  Here is a bottle review:  Pours with a quickly dissipating head.  Dark ruby color.  Aroma is big alcohol, sweet sugar, and some nutty like cashew with spicy, yeasty hints.  Complex flavor, sometimes mellow, with deep peppery hints and some yeast bite.  Finish is smoky like true scotch ales."
"This may not be a Belgian-style brew per say, but a excellent brew nonetheless!"
"Cheers to frank4sail for the sample."
"Different flavor profile in the bottle than on tap, where the alcohol was much more muted. The tap brew is much more drinkable and enjoyable, IMO."
"Pours a beautiful deep red/orange with a thick creamy head that lasts well.  Smell is of sweet malt (caramel?), tartness of the raisins and slight alcohol.  The first taste is of a slight roasted malt bitterness that is quickly erased by the sweetness of the brew.  Not a sticky sugary sweet but a natural one that goes nicely (from the beet sugar?.)  There is also some tartness from the raisins.  The beer is creamy and smooth across the palate.  The surprising lack of alcohol in the taste makes this beer extremely drinkable.  I really liked this beer.  Very different, this is one of my favorite things about this brewery, there products are always different.  Even when they fit into a style they put a nice twist on the style."
"Interesting. Glad I tried it. However, I won't be ordering it again."
"12 oz bottle.  Deep red sweet belgian ale. Smell of sweet, malt, and belgian yeast.  Complex flavor, tart raisins, malt, and lots of alcohol.  Not a drink for the timid.  I like this beer very much as a nightcap.  It is a change of pace.  It is perfect to unwind with but, @ 8%ABV be careful.  Well crafted with unique flavor, it is rare to taste these divergent flavors of beet sugars, candy sugar, hops, and malt in an American Brew (or any brew). ""A" for effort to the Delaware guys."
"This review pains me somewhat. You see, I'm a Delaware native and have a special fondness for Dogfish Head. That being said, try as I might to love this beer, I can't. It's definitely complex, and I admire Dogfish Head for the effort. Just a bit too much going on, in my opinion, to add to my list of favorites. Of course, that will not stop me from drinking it when I'm visiting my folks down in Lewes!"
"Turned on to this one by Bierman9 (not a complete fool, he!!) Its dark copper color and fine head are good, and things get better from there. Sweet malty, fruity nose, and verrry good body and mouthfeel. The taste is of currants, raisins, malty sweetness and candy sugar....mmmmmm!! Easy to drink plenty o' these, especially on tap!"
"However, it is a beer that as I drink more of it, the more I like it. Surely, worth a try for anyone"
"46"
"Wow!  This 8% alcohol beer is quite a treat.  I couldn't tell it from a beer straight out of Belgium.  It has so much complexity that it could be integrated into a fancy meal, yet it's cheap price and sweet taste make it an ideal beer to drink for a night of interesting conversation.  A superb brew.  NOTE:  I just had another of these beers in March, and it was not near as good as the batch last November - too flat and sweet.  There seems to be some inconsistency in their brews at Dogfishead."
"Hugely complex as indicated by the other comments. Obvious alcohol taste and aroma. Think of dark raisin bread topped with caramelized brown sugar, add a hint of chocolate, liquify, enjoy."
"Hoo-hah! This is one serious beer!  Venom is right, this is an old-style ale, to me almost a barlywine.  Very chewy with dark fruit and a wine-like backbone.  Had it with skewered beef and a very hot dipping sauce.  This beer just laughed at the sauce and put it out without any effort."
