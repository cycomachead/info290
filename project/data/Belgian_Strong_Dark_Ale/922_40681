4.66,8.6,4.5,4.75,4.75,4.5,4.5,"Poured into a Gavroche tulip. Pours a dark., murky red-orange brown with a big, fine three finger light tan head with excellent retention and lots of lacing. Aroma of caramel malt, dark stone fruit, apple, clove, Belgian yeast. Flavor follows with caramel malt, dark and light stone fruit, apple and pear juice, clove, cinnamon and other earthy spicing, brown sugar, finishing with a semi-sweet, slightly sour burst of fruit flavors with light peppery spice from the clove and maybe hops. Beautifully integrated and flavorful. Medium bodied with really nice peppery carbonation that complements the spicing. An excellent, well balanced, complex Belgian dark that is very flavorful. The taste seems a bit subdued at first compared to the two top well-known Belgian strong ales, but the flavor builds and gets more interesting throughout the taste. Complex flavor covers the ABV well, making this a dangerous ale because it continually invites tasting. World class. Glad I finally got to try this rare beer.","LiquidAmber","Apr 26, 2014"

4.42,3,4.5,4.25,4.5,4.25,4.5,"Poured a rich, dark, almost blackish brown color, with a one finger tan head that grew to a two finger head before receding to a thick foam leaving abundant lacing down the glass. Very nice, well done example of the style. Scents of dark fruit especially plume, some fig, red grape, slight grape skin, bready malt, hints of candi sugar, Belgian yeast, and some honey and cream, along with some wild sour and tannin like aromas all mingling together. As it warms apricot enters the aroma profile as well. Very pleasant, fruity, sweet and complex aroma with some nice wild yeast detectable. Very good, true to style but also unique in its own way. Taste begins with a boozy, sweet, fruity flavors with notes of alcohol, raisin, grape, plum, prune and fig flavors along with some sugary, caramel-like flavors, candi sugar and slight bready malt. Some slight sour flavors are present in the background throughout the sip. Alcohol and candi sugar notes remain present throughout with sour notes becoming more prominent on the middle and end of the sip. Tannins and slight red wine flavors join the fruity and caramel flavors in the middle and finish, but in a subdued fashion, while the bready malts drop off. Abundant alcohol on the finish as well as faint earthy Belgian hop and faint Belgian yeast spiciness and some sour notes. Aftertaste is earthy hops and alcohol. A very fruity, sweet, yet also sour flavor profile that is quite complex, though not to the degree of Rochefort 10. Still very well executed with a variety of flavors on the display. The Mouthfeel is sticky and medium-heavy bodied with moderate carbonation, a slight acidic sting and a bit of an alcohol burn. Semi-drying. A good, pleasant sipping beer mouthfeel, true to style. Not quaffable, but that's not what the style is about. Overall quite the nice Trappist dark ale. True to the bones of the style but with a unique character due to the red wine and sour notes with a wonderful aroma and flavor and a nice sipping mouthfeel, quite nice and worth the $20 I paid to try it.","Auraan","Jan 01, 2014"

Tiny chunks of sediment are seen floating around in the beer after the pour. Smell is of malt, dark fruit, caramel, toffee, and alcohol aromas. Taste is much the same with fruit, caramel, and slight cardboard flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of spice bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel.

Pours hazy very dark reddish brown color with a nice 1 finger dense cream colored head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of big raisin, apple, pear, prune, caramel, molasses, brown sugar, toast, dark bread, light clove, pepper, herbal, and earthy yeast spiciness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of malt and fruity esters. Taste of big raisin, pear, apple, prune, caramel, molasses, toast, toffee, brown sugar, dark bread, chocolate, earth, and light yeast spiciness. Lingering notes of dark fruits, caramel, molasses, toast, toffee, chocolate, dark bread, earth, and light yeast spiciness on the finish for a while. Fantastic balance and complexity of dark malt and fruity esters; with zero cloying sweetness present after the finish. Light carbonation and fairly full bodied; with a very slick and creamy mouthfeel that is great. The low carbonation works very well here. Alcohol is extremely well hidden with zero warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a fantastic Belgian strong dark ale! Fantastic balance and complexity of dark malt and fruity ester flavors; very smooth and lush to sip on. A highly enjoyable offering as expected.","superspak","Feb 04, 2013"

The taste was mostly determined by the dark fruit, but was elaborated with some burnt, smokey tinges as well as some whiskey notes and a little bit of leather and earth on the finish.

4.36,1.6,4.5,3.5,5,3.5,4.5,"2007 bottle, aged @ about 58F, opened 1/11. Pours with an effervescent, frothy head that settles into a creamy layter that leaves nice lacing. The beer is ruddy mahogany and just gorgeous, really. The smell is raisins, cherries, cranberries, leather and a sugary caramel that makes the beer seem it will be very sweet (which the fresher examples I've had indicate it can be). The taste is just wonderful. That leather hits first, then cacao, a slight sharpness, a hint of sweet, then a lovely dry, earthy finish that just makes you want more. The mouthfeel is slight carbonation and then a slickness, a bit lighter than it looks or tastes. Drinkability is great, the alcohol is just a warm afterthought and the balance between the sweet and dry makes it go down very easy. To be honest, this has always been at the bottom of the Trappist list but aging this thing really brings out a lot that you don't get with the fresh stuff, beating out what we had at the monastery even though those glasses had the "I'm drinking it where its made with the monks after searching for this place forever" cachet.

The nose is chocked full of dark fruit such as plums, dates and figs, along with a good dose of chocolate and spice. More dark fruit and spice (cinnamon?) show up in the taste, along with some very pleasant rustic bread crust characters as well. It comes off as very juicy in all of the fruit flavor that is present.

Surprisingly soft and layered with complexity to the tongue, a rye-like spiciness tingles the tongue late in the sip. The 9.5% ABV is not apparent whatsoever.

Starting with a flash of sweetness I then tasted the heartier notes of wood, earth, toasted malt and bitter hops. Hints of leather, coffee and chocolate lurked underneath the dark fruits, caramel, brown sugar and sour apples. Tight and well organized. The coffee finish was dry and clean.

I've heard average reviews of the Brune and Blonde, but I was completely blown away by this beer, I'm glad I chose the Extra. When the cap was popped it foamed like crazy, the smell was wine-like and fruity. The taste was similar, sweet with slight sugar, and a tangyness that reminded me of Duchesse de Bourgogne. The colour was a dark brown with a strong billowy head. Carbonation was typical of trappists, although not as prickly as some.

Head retention is good, lacing is average. This bottle was definitely a gusher, it didn't take long for the carbonation/foam to come out of the bottle after opening. It smells like dark fruit (raisins, plums), brown sugar, oranges and peppery spice. Taste is similar to the aroma, but there's some toffee, yeast and bitter herbal/grassy hops noticable. However, there's also a slight metallic taste in the finish that I don't care for. Mouthfeel/body is medium, with high (but soft) carbonation which works well in this brew and makes it feel nice and creamy. Drinkability is good, it's not hard to drink at all.

Looks more like the standard Achel 8 label ... but is definitely the 'Extra' at 9.5% abv. Anyway, this one extracts from the bottle as a warm, dark brown with ruby highlights. A thick cocoa tan head appears and likes to stick around. To look at this beer, you know there's a lot going on here. Nose is glorious ... yeast, sweet malts, stewed fruits, and a hint of spice ... okay, quite smelling and start drinking, right.Palate is sweet ... sweeter than the Brune ... very malty and warm. Tastes of Belgian yeast, plums, mollases, and alcohol. Very dark, very sweet, and assertive taste. This beer is a heavyweight ... in taste more than body. This is akin to the Brune in a lot of ways, but stronger and much more assertive. I really enjoy the sheer "power" of this 'Extra' over the other Achel offerings. You know you're drinking something substantial here for sure. Wow ... I still have a half of a 750 ml bottle left. A bit too much for one sitting, perhaps, especially on an empty stomach.

Woody and slightly sour in character, the scent becomes juicier, fruitier as it sits. Candi sugar sweetness starts the sip, soon harnassed by a woody character that runs throughout. As the beer warms, this malt develops more figgy, and even grapey character. A gentle, cinnamon spice lends character to a cocoa-like malt body. Somewhat peppery in the finish where the spice kicks in, but the alcohol is overall quite unobtrusive. Mouthfeel is a bit tangy, but fairly full and coating in spite of this.

The taste easily matches the aroma, big fruit and malt flavors: currant, blackberry, fig, plum, raspberry, toasted bread, dark candied sugar, light clove and corriander spices, floral and grassy hops, and some fruity ale esters.

4.72,10,4.5,5,5,3.5,4.5,"sampled 6/03/05. Just a glorious beer. This was a hit around the table, even with those who may not have had a Belgian beer before. It poured a glowing, batter-y, leather brown and put forth a mild head and a small ring of foam. The beer emitted a rich aroma of caramel, apples, tilled earth, fruit, figs, honey and marzipan? What the..? (** Just saw V's review below and he mentioned almonds, so I guess I am not completely off with the marzipan.) The flavor is sweet and quick, a melange of the above elements with mild black pepper, perfume, and tree bark? (Damned if I know what kind of tree.) There's some candy sugar and a medium dose of alcohol, contributing to what evolves into a maple syrup character. The beer is delicate, yet forceful, with gummy hops and some strong seed flavors. The mouthfeel is good but not particularly thick; there's some foaminess in the mouth and it could be smoother on the whole. The drinkability maintains an average pace, which is actually quite brisk for such a strong beer. Highly recommended -- you should get some.","Thrasher","May 24, 2005"

4.44,3.5,3.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Overall: I really enjoyed the 8° Brune, and whilst this is supposed to be a Brune Extra, the delinquent appearance detracted from this one a little. Now, of course, this could well be the result of poor handling so Im hesitant to be too harsh here. Nevertheless, for the Extra [read Extra Powerful and Extra Raw] Brune, this one lacks the smooth rich mature aspects of the 8° Brune but it makes up for that with its fast heart beat inducing Street Racing nature. The Achelse Kluis is a Powerful Brune, which maybe needs some aging to get the best from it, though given the under-carbonated example I had, I would have to know that the sample I decided to cellar was in better shape. Still, it is worth trying and well worth cellaring.","TheLongBeachBum","Sep 27, 2004"

Achel yeast doesnt provide any dryness. Sweet and closing to licorice at times. Honeyish, herbal. Mostly malty from the beginning until the end. Finish could use some punch.

Particulary complex nose; malt, plum-like fruitiness, yeasty, cocoa and some alcohol notes. Clovey phenolic and vinous, with ample maltiness and caramelly sweetness, dark fruit notes like plum and currant, and a pungent yeastiness; lightly hopped, drying the finish a bit. Alcohol esters are sharp, but melded pretty well with all the other amalgamation of flavors. Ample carbonation keeps it light and crisp on the tongue, enhancing the overall experience. A thin cap of foam lasts all to way to the bottom of the goblet. A very nice Trappist overall, and the best in the Achel line of ales.","crookedhalo","Jul 16, 2004"

4.47,4.2,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Certainly worth trying! When I first opened an Achel 8 Brune side by side with the Achelse Kluis and tasted them cold from the fridge I thought that these beers were both born from the same grist bill with one being just slightly larger. Now I'm not so sure. I was very disappointed with the 8 Brune, but the Kluis is quite special. They initally appear to be almost exactly the same in the glass with a hazy/cloudy russet brown colored body and dark ivory cap, but the head on the Kluis is much creamier, holds far longer, and leaves some very nice lacing lace whereas the basic Achel drops and leaves next to no lace. The nose on both is similar with a sugar-cookie dough maltiness, some red grape, a splash of yeasty spiciness and some alcohol, but the Kluis is much richer and even displays a lightly cocoa-ish side. And, I guess to some extent, the alcohol is more restrained even though it's a touch higher in actual content. Hmmm.... I think more time and effort is put into this beer; as well as a bit more malt. The body is solidly medium and starts to border on full but never quite gets there; and its very fine, natural carbonation tingles the tongue. In the flavor, semi-rich cocoa-tinged sugary maltiness acts as a base while notes of grape-like fruitiness, a spray of hops, and some lightly peppery alcohol and yeasty spiciness widen its character. It's impeccably balanced despite its strength; and it finishes drying with some lingering sugar, hop, and fruit. Although the intensity of the alcohol is still an issue, this remains an impressive and majestic brew that's on par with most of the other Trappist brews... think somewhere between a Chimay Premiere and Grande Reserve. Give it a shot!","NeroFiddled","May 18, 2004"

Aroma is sharp -- raisins, lime juice, mink oil, lots of yeasty perfume. Flavor goes in a slightly different direction and is solidly matched by a good medium mouthfeel. Very plummy, clove gum, and a back up of dried current, sweeter than the aroma implies. Becomes more molasses-like on warming, a white rum kind of deal. Hopping is a trace effect at best, but the wild and slightly astringent aroma matches well with the stolid body and malty flavors. Could use just a trace more complexity to the latter.
