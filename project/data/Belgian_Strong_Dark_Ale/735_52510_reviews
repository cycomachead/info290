"Pours a dark, murky, medium brown producing 2+ fingers of moderately lasting, tan, frothy head that leaves nice strings & rings of lacing. Aroma pumpernickel, dark fruits, roast, molasses, faint cocoa & floral hop tones. Taste is similar but more robust with cherry, coriander, hints of anise, cloves & more cocoa than in the nose. Finishes very peppery/spicy with a chocolate cherry cordial, molasses, coriander aftertaste. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, medium carbonation, silky/creamy but with a light spice bite in the finish."
""
""
"O - the mouthfeel really can't stop one from not enjoying such a good flavored and tasty ale. This is Belgian inspired with American style and one I would drink again in the future. If you have the chance grab a few of these. Monk's Blood is worth the buy."
"O: A nicely layered American-made BSDA with plenty going on. Drinks very easily for being 8.3%, with the alcohol being hidden mostly by the yeast and complexity. Definitely worth picking up if you're into BSDAs, as it's interesting to compare to the Belgians"
""
""
"Poured a dark red with about a finger of off white foam. Good amount of effervescence. Smells of toasted grain, prune/raisin, hint of vanilla. Tastes malty, sweet forward without being overpowering, dark fruit (prune/fig), nice mid note twang, almost metallic taste, bit of oaky, vanilla notes and transitions a pretty clean finish. Carbonation more appreciable as it warms, as is the complexity of the flavors. Medium bodied and very smooth. Well balanced overall. Purchased in a pack of four – good price point for a solid and tasty beer. ABV well hidden. It reminded me a bit of Three Philosophers – another great beer."

"Very drinkable for the heavier style. Will definitely seek out/buy again."
""
""
""
"Enjoyable."
""
""
"Strong and bold. Like me."
"Overall a solid and unique beer. The name is more fitting when fresh, as it is more viscous and ""blood-like", but the flavor is a bit raw then. With a year on it, it is still a solid beer, but I would probably prefer it at the 6-9 month mark the most."
""
""
"Not sure what it is, but pretty good. Maybe a lager?"

"I can't complain too much as the price is not excessive for this, but this isn't a top notch version of style.   Great name."
"It's back. Sanguine with laced off white foam. Syrupy molasses, hint of cinnamon, grape juice. Lite carbonation, cola flavor with French vanilla."

"thanks to my buddy for sharing this one with me. cool beer with oak and cinnamon and vanilla and figs. all of those elements are in play in this burgundy cherrywood colored brew. the vanilla is most abundant in the nose, i hardly get the cinnamon at all there, and the figs are enjoyably forward too. not a lot of fig beers out there, so this is fun. i wish for more carbonation right away, it looks flat in the glass, and feels heavy on the palate because of its lack of bubbles. the flavors are great though, all united and mellowed by the oak, the vanilla is nice, and the cinnamon is a subtle accent that works really well with the figs and gives the whole thing a very winter seasonal feel. very holiday. its thick beer, enhanced more by its stillness, its palate coating and belly filling, but in a great way. the figs are distinct, especially in the finish, and all of the elements come together expertly well i think. cool beer, not hot on the booze at all, and very unique. good stuff, but i wouldnt do more than one can in a single sitting."

"Tastes like cherry cough syrup"

"O: A great brew, one totally worth trying. The fruity and spicy notes keep this beer relevant in a world full of great beer, this one has plenty of character."

"O: You've got to give at least a few points to 21st Amendment for the packaging here. The can itself is worthy of some praise. The story printed along the outside draws you into the experience of the brew. This is a good beer for a cold, cloudy, contemplative day when like the monks you want to reflect upon the profound."

""
""
"Pours a one finger off-white head that fades quickly leaving no lace. Dark brown color. Light-medium carbonation and medium bodied. Burnt dark fruit nose and flavor is roasted malt and hints of brown sugar. $3.99 for a 12oz dark brown can from Julio’s Liquors Westborough, Ma. Canned Mar 3, 2014."

"I am not usually a fan of dark beers but this Ale was surprisingly delicious. The notes of vanilla and figs added to the malty sweetness of this delicious brew. A higher ABV than expected, these cans pack a punch. Definitely worth a try"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- I know for a fact that this can has been sitting around for at least a year but time has actually done it justice.  It's not outstanding by any means but it's a serviceable Belgian strong that has a good amount of character and is quite drinkable."
""
"Good bitter mixed drink substitute."
""
"Overall:  Another homerun from 21st Amendment, and one of my favorite American versions of a Belgian strong dark ale.  Absolutely delicious!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O:  Really well done brew.  I now appreciate the diversity this brewery produces, from IPA’s to saisons, to Belgian dark ales.  This brew is up to standard.  Bought at Bruisin Ale’s in Asheville, NC, now drinking in Kunming, China."
""
"O: Very interesting beer; I would definitely recommend it if you're in the mood for something flavorful and just a bit different."
""
"O:  Definitely worth a quaff.  Has some interesting flavors and follows the style within a shadow of a reason.  The cherry coke and yeast are what I get from most belgian dubbel and this does not disappoint."

"Pours honey brownish with a ruby tint to it. Slight haze pretty glow. A fat head of tan foam that falls quickly and leaves a ring but no lace. Nose is soft malt with a light caramel over it. Touch of brown sugar on the nose. Soft bread and dark fruits. raisin and date, there's even some bright cherry. A touch of wood and a bit of spice. Drinks just like that. With a creamy supple mouthfeel punctuated by a touch of carbonation. It has a good lightness in the mouthfeel that I was not expecting for so high an abv. It is medium mouthfeel. A bit of alcohol grazes the palate before this sweetened bread with all it's fruit finishes dry and with a bit of earthy spice. It does finish a bit sweeter than I would like but overall very good."

"Final Thoughts: While it's very good, I have a hard time rating Monk's Blood as exceptional. This is due to the almost dabilitating amount of sweetness in this beer. Wish the oak chips could have shined through to bring a little balance. As it stands, Monk's Blood is just too sweet to be completely enjoyable. Would I drink it again? No, but I would recommend it to fans of the style."

"This is a beer you will want again and again, as I do."
""
""
""
"O - The style edges sweet, but this beer still a touch too sweet. That said there's a really nice, well balanced complexity to the flavor profile."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: tasty and complex. Worth seeking."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O- Definitely a drink that I should have left on my counter for a while before drinking it. I'm not running to the store to get another but I certainly wouldn't turn one down if it were offered to me."

""
""
""
""
"O: Delicious, excellent brew."
""
""
""
""
""
"D: I think user Sammy said it best…Not true to the style but fun to try and would definitely have again. Lots of integrated flavors built into this one and fairly easy to quaff on account of the great mouth feel. But they give you a lot to explore so it’s fun to take your time with this one. My highest score from 21st Amendment yet."
""
"O: This one has a great smell and is fairly enjoyable to the taste, though I wish the alcohol was a little more well hidden. Definitely a slow sipper."
"O – Dug this one. Not overly complex taste just plain good with a great subtle mix. You can taste all the flavors and drink this one all night long."
""
""
""
""
""
"Served in a small snifter. Dark red amber in the glass with a half finger off-white head with good retention and lacing. Aroma of fresh and dried dark stone fruit, particularly plums, sweet caramel malt, Belgian yeast. Flavor follows with semi sweet dark stone fruit, caramel malt, light Belgian yeast and spicing, hints of vanilla. Medium bodied with nice carbonation. A quite nice domestic take on the Belgian strong dark style with some dubbel characteristics. Enjoyable. 21st Amendment beer seems to be uneven, probably due to the fact that they are brewed at different locations, I've had one canned beer months apart that were alternatively great and truly awful. This was quite well made and encouraging."

"O - to each his own, totally missed the mark for me. Far better and enjoyable Belgians out there. Dispite some cellering, a boozy mess. Lacked depth, flavor, and body. Will have another down the road to see if opinion changes, and if so, will edit post."

"12 oz single can bought from LIfesource Natural Grocer in Salem OR. $2.59 Pours a brown with garnet aspects around the edges. Large creamy thick light tan coloured head. Creamy fudge like aromas foillowed by raisin and spice. Slightly cheesy and earthy ,complex. Very smooth and balanced taste with the same as the aroma, but a touch of alcohol and herbal bitterness. Palate is just fine..reasonably smooth and easily drinkable. Its OK but not up to the Belgian standards."

"More then pleased to see an American brewery nail the Belgian style. True to character throughout. Deep dark brown/ruby. with oily beige head. Nice aroma of dried fruit and wood, taste more of the same, mild hops bitterness. Would not be out of place in a Brussels street café...."
""
""
"I enjoyed it but don’t think I could commit to more than one. I remember liking this one more, but I’m going to chalk that up to my tastes in beer changing so much since it was last released."

""
""
""

""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, quite pleasant. I probably wouldn't get a lot of this, but it's a bit different and certainly worth a try."
""
""
""
"Spicy dessert in a bottle. The vanilla seems to get stronger as the Belgian yeast works on it. Fairly dry at the finish, but the next sip starts out just as sugary. From the 22 oz bottle purchased at Bottleworks in Seattle."
""
""
"Two years on this and it’s way mellow and smooth. Don’t so much get figs, but good balance of sugar and spice. Broad strokes of a Belgian more than nuance, but solid and moreish."
""
"Beneath an aroma replete with fig and sweet cherry, caramel and maple, we get a flavor that leads with candy sugar, oaky vanilla and fig before giving way to green apple, bread crust and booze in a slightly drying finish. I like to let the glass warm a bit, as the malt sweetness that makes this beer so unique and tasty becomes more apparent with heat."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured a deep slightly cloudy ruby with a short lasting tan head that hangs on around the circumference of the glass. The aroma is sweet and fruity with a hint of spice. The taste is also sweet and fruity, this time with more distinct notes of cherry and a little vanilla. The mouthfeel is thick and smooth, with a silky finish. This is a very good, moderately complex, Belgian dark ale."
""
"A- a good, but not great stab at a belgian dark"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a good beer, not an amazing representation of the style though. Goes down pretty easy."
""
"A bit too spicy and sweet for me, but it's an OK beer, in terms of complexity. Think of it as a strong, spiced dubbel."
""
"This is particularly diverse, certainly different and definitely original. Unfortunately it's not my favorite flavors but for all its nuance it deserves a high score."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I had heard a lot of good things about this and that it had just returned. Interesting and a bit different from similar beers of this style. Still good, just not my cup of tea, but this style usually is."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- I really enjoyed this beer. It was one of those I was too busy saying ""damn that's good"" to concentrate too deeply on the order of things going on. I'm already planning on going back and buying more."
""
"Pretty good take on a Belgian abbey beer."
"O - pretty good drinkable dark Belgian  enjoying the hint of spices.  Would be great for a cold winter night"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- I have had this beer in years past and it has always been a pleaser for me until this year. I had to grab a 4 pack since it wasn't available in 2013. I don't know if 21st just dropped the ball or I got a bad 4 pack. This beer tasted like a crappy home brewed Abby. I don't know if they fermented warm, if the mash PH was off or if the oak was over done. Astringent , tannins, I don't know but it wasn't the beer I remember in the past."
""
""
""
""
""
"Taste is great! All of what you pick up in the aroma translates to the flavors, the banana does not come through nearly as much in the flavor as the nose but still noticeable, great example of a Belgian dark, 21st does it again! I'll be buying a 4 pack of this guys for sure!"

"pours pretty brown. all the flavors come through in this beer, and everything listen on the can, vanilla, fig, all blended well. sweeter than i prefer, and not getting the bite that I usually am tickled by. it does have its own character, a nice variation of a Belgian dark ale. unique"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Solid beer, I was a bit disappointed as I'm a big fan of 21st Ammendment and the style. I was expecting an excellent beer, but this is only very good. I will buy again if I see it."

"Can: Poured a dark burgundy color ale with a large light brown foamy head with good retention and some light lacing. Aroma consists of dry figs with quite a bit of residual sugar and some caramelized malt. Taste is also dominated by caramelized malt with too much residual sugar and some dry figs. Body is about average with good carbonation and light apparent alcohol. I thought this one was lacking balance with too much residuals sugar. It could be my mind playing tricks but I prefer my Belgian ale bottle conditioned not in cans."
""
""
"Finish: Oak, fig, caramel and some chocolate. Overall its pretty amazing stuff. I think I like it better fresh though. I don't think that this improved any with age. But at 8.3%, I don't think it was really meant to age."

"21st Ammendment made a good brew in Monk's Blood."
"Overall, I love 21st Amendment, but honestly as much as I like the dark belgian style, this is not one of my favorites. I tend to enjoy some of their other offerings a bit more. Not a bad brew to say the least, but I was slightly disappointed for $12 for a 4 pack."
"O - One of the better US made Belgians. Particularly impressive coming from a can. Strong heavy flavors make it a great sipping beer and not very sessionable."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Rich and very heavy beer all around. Filling."
"12 ounce can into tulip glass, canned on 3/26/2012. Pours lightly cloudy red copper color with a nice 2 finger fairly dense light khaki head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Nice dense soapy lacing clings to the glass. Aromas of molasses, banana, clove, pear, fig, cinnamon, allspice, dark bread, candi sugar, oak, pepper, and yeast spiciness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity. Taste of prune, brown sugar, fig, dark bread, toast, cinnamon, clove, ripe banana, oak, candi sugar, earth, and yeast spiciness. Lingering notes of dark fruit, brown sugar, dark bread, toast, candi sugar, clove, cinnamon, banana, earth, oak, and yeast spices on the finish for a good bit. Solid flavor balance and good complexity; a touch too bready and spicy; with zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a creamy, slick, and lightly prickly mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a very good Belgian strong dark ale. Nice complexity and solid flavor balance; and very smooth to sip on. I enjoyed this quite a bit."
""
""
""
"Appearance shows a very dark brown color supporting a fair head and lace. Smell is rich in dark fruits, sweet malt, cotton candy with a light spice in the back. Taste of the rich dark fruits, light spice and having a sweetness of cream soda, hops are there but not upfront leaving a nice balance. Mouthfeel is medium with good carbonation. A nice treat to sip upon."

"Drink- I am still pissed we cant get 21st in So. Cal. This had to come all the way from DC from my bro-in-law. Oh well. Still a nice beer. Id have again, but fresh."
""
"while this one doesn't lack for flavor, the whole is less than the sum of its parts IMO. still a tasty brew i would welcome a revisit to, but not a home run."
"This won't be around in 2013 and maybe even longer so pick this up if you still can."
""
""
"How's my spelling MOM?"
"O: This has a lot of potential and I would love to try one closer to it's canned-on date. That being said, this can, while tasty overall, was too sweet/sugary for my palate."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Overall this is pretty good. Years ago the alcohol in the taste would have turned me right off, now I can appreciate how it adds to the flavour and character of the beer."
""
"Would I buy it again? Yes."
"The brew poured a slightly reddish-brown color and was a bit cloudy. The head was pure white and one finger. It dissipated after a few minutes and left some lacing on the glass. The nose presented with some booze, raisins and dark fruit and a hint of Belgian yeast. The taste is definitely dark fruit coupled with moderate carbonation and a hint of fig. The alcohol is pretty well hidden in the taste. A bit of spice also came out, specifically cinnamon. The body is a little lighter than expected, but very pleasant. This is definitely an easy Belgian style brew to drink and if not for the alcohol I would. The finish lingers a bit and for me, that’s where I got a bit of heat from the booze. This is a brew that does not disappoint. I would definitely have this again."
"M&D - however, the strangeness and uniqueness is what it has going for it. it is smooth and disappears quickly as you struggle to pinpoint the flavors, a good beer with one of the most unusual flavors (without being downright freaky)"

"O: Not a bad Belgian actually. Good drinking, pretty run of the mill. One of the better 21st A. beers I've had."
""
"12oz can. Pours a reddish brown with a medium lasting, slowly fading tan head, with some lacing. Aroma and taste of sweet caramel malt, dried dark fruits, dates, some Belgian yeast, some dark fruity esters and bitter notes. Palate is a medium body, with some lively carbonation. Finishes with some sweet caramel malt followed by some lingering bitter notes for balance, and a slightly dry alcohol ending. Overall a good, balanced and solid brew."
"O- A tasty offering from a can. 21st Amendment really has made a good beer here. Worth trying."
""
"The mouthfeel is leaning towards the heavier side with carbonation being a little below average. Overall, I thought it was a pretty good beer. I really liked the dark fruit and cherry flavors coming out of the malts. It did feel a little overly sweet at times, but overall i really enjoyed it."
"Served from can into a chalice. Poured a deep red-orange with a half finger off-white head that subsided to a minimal amount quickly. Maintained excellent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, red wine, spice, dark fruit, and plum. The flavor was of sweet malt, fruit, grape, spices, dark fruit, and subtle dark chocolate. It had a light feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a pretty decent brew. This one really reminded me a lot of a more toned down red wine when it came to the aromas given off here. There was a nice spice character here that was very similar to red wine as well. The addition of the dark fruit profile helped to balance this one out. The alcohol flavor was non-existant for me as the dark fruit and spices seemed to cover it up quite nicely. Definitely worth your time to try if you see it in your area."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall impression: A definite American version of a Belgian. Hop character seems way forward and alcohol is dominate. Could stand some age. I'm enjoying it now but I can see why some wouldn't consider it a classic."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Too sweet and sugary. If I had to describe this in10 words or less it'd be 'A sugary, fruity rum and coke'. Lots of alcohol burn on the back end."
""
"O - I haven't had many BSDAs but this drinks really well. Great for the price too. Would definitely buy again."
""
""
""
"There's a lot going on in this but the flavors muted and unfocused and the oak is barley coming through. It does it the marks for the style of being dark, rich, complex and strong and possible smooth depending on home much pepper you enjoy."
"QUITE NICE, WORTH TRYING!"
""
"O: forgot what I was drinking as I was enjoying it so much - a very good beer; I've had plenty of BSDA but this is only my 2nd 21st Amendment brew (Hop Crisis) and I'm very confident in recommending it to all prospective buyers. Why don't people like this more? I'm guessing the cinnamon may not sit right with some - fair enough..."
"Pours a murky dark brown with a 1/2 inch foamy dark khaki head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small dots and streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of toasted malt, dark fruits, vanilla, brown sugar, and some woody aromas. Taste is of malt, prunes/figs, vanilla, brown sugar, alcohol, and a dry woody flavor on the finish. There is a slight hint of spice bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer but I am enjoying the aromas coming off this one more than the flavors."
""
""
""
""
"D - Very drinkable. Very nice BSDA. I like the cinnamon and vanilla flavors alongside the Belgian yeast and dark caramel malts."
""
""
"Seems like an overly yeasty jumbled mess to me."
"O-this was a pretty good beer. Not as syrupy and sweet as some lesser American Belgians get. I would definitely get this again if I had paid less. $6.50 for the can. I might as well just get a Chimay."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a decent beer. It has good flavor and drinkability. Even more evidence that good beer can come from a can."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Full-bodied, long finish, deeply textured, with apparent alcohol. Rises higher with each additional drink. Rich, warming, and comfortable. But I couldn't more than two of this without causing trouble. In fact, I can feel the urge to raise a ruckus right about now."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"By the time I tasted this, my palate was pretty much wrecked by the terrible Iron Fist Spice of Life, but I still got a pretty good impression from this one. Served in a ball-stem goblet, a hazy, dark, reddish-brown color with a small off-white head. Aroma of bready malts, caramel, soft fruits and spice. Taste was a bit muted at first, but fleshed out a bit mid-palate onward. Caramel and candi-like sugars, bready, cinnamon and spice, and more of the soft, indistinct fruit I got on the nose, hints of cola and some phenol. Medium-bodied, fairly chewy, some alcohol warmth. Overall pretty decent, but I don't see myself having more than one glass in a session before moving on to something else."
""
""
"O: a very nice brew that displays a nice amount of complexity and balance that I have not found in many of 21st amendments othe brews... I really enjoyed this beer and understand why it has the cult following that it does. Deffinatly a must try."
"Cheers!"
""
""
""
"O: SWWEEET AND BOOOOZZZEE TASTE THE 8.3 BUT WELL MADE FOR AN AMERICAN BREW SUGGEST A TRY"
"Mouthfeel is creamy and silky smooth, with little carbonation and a medium body that goes down watery, but has enough alcohol bite to make this a slow sipper. Decent beer, but didn't live up to the hype and not one I’d seek out."
""
""
"a dark burgundy colored pour with 2 fingers of off white head. smells of grapes, alcohol, pecan, vanilla, strawberry. a very bitter sweet fruity mouthful! a hint of cherries, grapes, nuts, figs, a bit of dirt bitterness.. almost like drinking tree sap! medium bodied, nicely carbonated, light amount of creaminess. this is an overall hell of a beer. i wish it were a bit less carbonated and more syrupy on the mouthfeel, but i'll live. glad i got 3 more of these to savor throughout the next few months."
"O: The booze overpowers the fruity notes though and cut the sweetness a tad too deep. This 8.3% ABV dark Belgian strong ale would do well with some extensive wood-aging or at least to sit a while longer."
""
""
""
"O: a tasty and complex belgian strong dark. it's a little harsh at times and the alcohol isn't masked well but it's pretty good. Trois Pistole is the beer that I compare others of this style to and this one falls a bit short."
"This is the 2nd time I have tried this beer and, honestly, I like it better the 2nd time around as opposed to the first. In my opinion, there are some better BSDA's out there but this one isn't bad at all. I wish the cinnamon and vanilla elements were a little bit more prominent because this would, in my opinion, make this one a little bit more unique for the style. Still, I will enjoy the remainder of my 4 pack and would have it again (though not necessarily seek it out)."
""
""
"This one ain't perfect, but I would give it the thumbs up. The candied sugar is a little heavy handed, and the bitterness comes off like burnt sugar at a colder temperature, but both aren't as bad halfway through. It's definitely complex enough to be called a Belgian Strong Dark and own the name. Balance this one out and it's a homer."
""
""
"Overall a good strong beer that makes a nice pairing with cherry pie."

"Overall: A pretty solid and interesting take on a dark Belgian ale. Very nice dark fruit taste and the spices add a nice twist."
"Sweet aroma of bready malt with notes of dark fruit (cherries?) and toffee. Body is a cloudy brown color with a touch of creamy white head floating on top. Palate is sweet, fruity, and spicy, with notes of cherries, nutmeg, allspice, and vanilla. Finish is warm and sweet, a bit more than is my usual preference. This certainly isn't a subtle beer, but it's still pretty tasty."
""
"Overall – While it had a very nice look and wonderful aroma, it was a bit lacking in mouthfeel and taste. It was to boozy at the end and the darker fruit flavors that I was expecting to experience were rather light in comparison to a more roasty malt flavor. Overall it is an OK Belgian dark, but not one to look for with any real frequency."

"O: interesting take on the style. I like it quite a bit, though I didn't think this style would be good in a can for some reason."
"O: this is a pretty good brew, there just seems to be too much going on in the taste, i mean its just kinda all over the place, not a bad thing just an observation, on the otherhand, this is possibly the most complex beer ive seen come out of a can so its a toss up i suppose"
"Overally pretty good - the latter half of the beer was a bit tough for me."
"Overall, a very solid beer from a can and a solid belgian; flavors are interesting and unique but it's missing something in its mouthfeel and presence."

"O: One of my top three Seasonal cold brews. This is 21st Amendments best offering to date!!"

"O: A great beer but a little hard to drink more that one because it has such a richness and complexiness to it."
"o - overall, paint me impressed. it isn't often that you try an american take on a belgian strong dark that catches the style properly. this beer won't hold up to the true pioneers of the style and there are some american breweries that do it better, but this is definitely a beer on the top end of list for the style originating in the US. cheers 21st amendment...nicely done. will definitely be revisiting this one again."
"O- Overall a tasty beer and one of the better made examples of an American-made Belgian style."
"Pours a dark brown with a richly frumpy head of tan foam with excellent retention. Sweet aromas of dark fruits like raisins and dates and plums. A date-like taste dominates the front and midpalate, with a lot of dark fruity sweetness and belgian spiciness growing larger on the mid to backpalates. Extremely rich and concentrated, more so than other Belgian Strong Dark Ales that I've had. I like this a lot and will definitely buy it again."
"Overall - I really enjoyed this. Loved the oaked/cinnimon/nutmeg flavor it provided. Alot of flavors mixed into one beer. Its different, almost at times i think im drinking a winter warmer. Its got decent balance, the alcohol does overpower a little but if you want something different and high on flavor, give this a shot."
""
"O: On the fence with this one, not sure I'd seek it out again but I didn't think it was bad. The oak and vanilla, cinnamon and figs are all detectable. Pretty decent."
"Pours a diaphanous black ale with a ring and central cap of light tan foam. Smells of banana, vanilla, a hint of lemon, sugar and belgian yeast. Flavor of cola with hints of cherry/artifical strawberry. As odd as this sounds, the flavor reminds me of red twizzlers - seriously. I'm not disappointed by this, but caught off-guard. I actually, kinda dig in a novelty sort of way. Medium bodied with hi carb. Semi slick finish. Overall a decent beverage, I've got one that's a year old in the cellar, we will see how it holds up tomorrow. 2.5/2.5/3.5/3/3.5"
"Deep blood garnet, hazy mahogany body with a thick cap of khaki foam tinged red. Loads of lacing. Gorgeous. Smell is vanilla and figs, earthy, malty, sweet. Taste has a distinct sense of fig newtons..figs, cinnamon, processed bread, vanilla, raisins, spice, mildly sweet, nutty. Body could be more substantial, it falls apart just a bit. Carbonation is good. Glad I tried it, and it's growing on me with each can consumed. ABV is fairly well hidden, but not going to attempt all four cans at same sitting."

"Overall: this is a very interesting beer from an interesting brewery. I hear this beer is going away which is sad. Get it while you can!"
""
""
""
""
"D: definitely get almost all the aspects that are written on the side of the can, vanilla, oak, cinnamon, and a fruitiness. not necessarily figs, but definitely a deep, sweet fruitiness. well-made."
""
""
"this is a very intriguing beer. it deserves to be a seasonal. not something i want often or a lot of but an excellent beer on another track all together."
""
"Overall: Not too crazy about this one; Belgians are tricky and some breweries struggle to deliver the package; this beer is an example of that problem"

"2015 Notes - Had another cellared can from 2011 on 2015-03-14 (Pi day and Einstein's 100th birthday) and it's tasting pretty good. It really aged well. I guess my tasres have changed but I'm enjoying it more now than in 2012. The cinammon, vanilla and oak are very prominent. I raised my taste score a bit but didn't change the language of my initial review."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O/D-Not a fan of this beer. I haven't come across a brew with that artificial fruit flavor that I have enjoyed. Not my style. Glad I only bought one can. I did not enjoy this beer but I can understand why some people may. Once again, just not for me."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is an interesting beer. For the style, this is a departure. Far sweeter than most examples of style and far less of a full and thick mouthfeel. The complexity isn't really there, but it is still enjoyable. If you don't like strong fruit notes in your beer though, you won't like this all that much IMO."
"Poured from the can a deep ruby tinged chesnut brown with a large light tannish colored head atop.Aromas of spiced cherries,brown sugar and malt loaf,maybe a bit much on the spiced cherries wich come into play even more on the palate.Dark fruit wich mainly means cherries and phenolic yeasty spice dominat the flavors with cakey brown sugar-like notes underneath,sweetish alcohol rounds out the finish.It's not horrible but there are many more complex and not so sweet versions of the style."
""

""
""
"Overall, it is subtly distinct take on a Belgian Strong. 21st Amendment shows they know their stuff, and that they have the ability to execute their own interpretation."
""
"Pours an opaque chocolaty brown with a thick light tan head. Rich aroma has a malty core and cinnamon, caramel and apple notes plus hints of wood and cloves. Excellent flavor has malty, fruity, cinnamon, horehound and hoppy notes. Bitterness is subtle and nicely balances the sweet component. Lively, fizzy texture has firm body and leaves a woody, fruity finish. Take, drink, this is monk’s blood! :D"
""
"This is worth drinking once or twice but it tastes like some of the fruit needs to be tamed down a bit. I think I'll let a can or two age a few months and give it another try."
"The smell is a real nice cinnamon and vanilla. For better or for worse, it hardly smells like alcohol. It's a tangy sweet, and I'm delighted that it's not that dark-candied sugar so prevalent in other BSDAs. The feel is SO light for what I thought would be kind of a thick and chewy, Belgian yeast-dominated beer. In addition to that cinnamon and vanilla, there's only a slight Belgian twang with almost a cherry almond finish. It's like a light dessert, yet thin enough for an aperitif. In sum, it's probably the best beer I've had from the brewers at 21st Amendment."
""
""
""
"Boozy, hazy, iPad like with some cinnamon added. Painful to finish, first dump of 2012!"
""
"O: The alcohol is quite noticeable, perhaps a bit overshadowing for some of the finer points of the drink preventing the complexity from being more appreciated. Warming and spicy."
"Easy drinking, especially for the style, and quite enjoyable. While generally off style, this was enjoyable with an afternoon of relaxation."
""
""
"A very good American representation of the style with a fruit and spice twist that doesn't muddle the concept nor fry the taste buds. Goes down pretty easy despite the strength. A prime winter brew in a can. I have another that I will experiment with aging some more. Worth a taste, and your undivided attention."
"Bottom Line: try it you will like it! great beer from 21st!"

"Poured from a can into a snifter, the beer is a muddled, hazy, ruby-highlighted brown coloring with a thin, sparse, light beige film around the edge of the surface. Aromas are strong and sweet, with a nose heavy in fig and dates, with some boozey kicks. Some light spicing and rich, heavy malt, also. Flavors are rich, with a roasted, tangy caramel sweetness, as well as some dark fruit highlights of date, fig, and raisins. Some very subtle spicing throughout, with hints of clove and all spice. The aftertaste is tangy and slightly boozey, with all of the dark fruit sweetness carrying through into the finish. A slow, smooth transition over the palate leads to a somewhat abrupt, clean finish. Slightly cloying at the very end, this is a decent Belgian Strong, and I think it's the first one I've had in a can. Very interesting."

"An interesting dark Belgian beer. A little spicy with a big body. Kind of hard to describe in my opinion, and overall, I actually wasn't a huge fan. The whole beer just seemed kind of muddled to me. If I saw mix packs from 21st, I wouldn't be upset if this beer was in it, but I'd probably never pick up the beer on its own aging considering all the other really good beer they make."

"O - Very good Belgian. Impressed; I haven't enjoyed a 21 A beer I've had yet til now. Deep, rich, drinkable, complex. Metal/blood aroma is slightly off putting, but fades quick."
""
""
""
""
"O: An alright beer. The hairspray alcohol flavor throws it off a tad. Not really a beer for me."
"O: This is tasty and glad to finally have it. Thanks Reja!"
"Overall: Good effort with requisite flavor profiles, though not quite as tame as others in its category."
"Overall impression - not great by any means, but it's not terrible either. Consider the brewery."
"This stuff is pretty good. The first thing you get from this is the Belgian yeast characteristic. Lots of clovey yeasty taste in there. After that comes a malt background complimented by strong cinnamon. The body is nice and light, packing a good amount of yeasty cinnamony flavor complimenting the traditional abbey flavor."
"D: overall it is a tasty beer and pretty complex with the fruity, malty, and oak/bourbon all rolled into one beverage, I would definitely recommend it if you like oak aged/bourbon barrel aged beers"
"On tap at 21st Amendment during SF Beer Week. Not bad, but really didn’t do it for me overall. Dark blood-like red color with a small off-white head. Aroma of sweet malt, dark fruits, sugar, and yeast. Flavor was similar - really fruity with sweet and sour notes as well as some roastiness. Complex for sure, but I don’t think it came together all that well. Fairly full palate. Not too drinkable."
"This beer was medium bodied and only a little sticky. The carbonation is heavy, helping push the beer over your tongue and down your gullet. Very refreshing."
"12oz can poured into Duvel tulip... luscious head fills to the top and dissipates in about 2 minutes. 40 degree pour... gonna let it warm up a bit. Aroma is smooth, fruity and rich... very pleasant and inviting. Citus hops are tangy. Flavor is very smooth, dark, rich and crisp. Ladies and gentleman, we seem to have a winner. Loses a few points for arrogant booziness, alcohol would have been hidden a little better in a 5-rated brew. Mouthfeel is smooth, lightly carbonated per style,"
"91."
"Overall, this is a splendid brew, and well-worth seeking out."
"Notes: The nose is pretty friggin' great. The palate feels thin for the style and the flavors that it's supporting. Seems a bit thinned out by the alcohol presence. Solid though, my first Belgian-style canned beer."
"Overall pretty good beer, I don't think I have seen many belgian style beers in cans. Pretty suprising."
"Overall eh worth a try, I know I have been wanting to try it, but wont be trying it again."
"Overall, a good beer that I look forward to having next year. Just disappointed that I only picked up one 4 pack."
"O: Likeable! I have a couple more in the fridge in which I'll enjoy or introduce to a friend.."
"Pours a medium brown-red with a thin tan head that does not linger long. A few bubbles rising at the edges. Big oak cinnamon aroma with brown apple, clove, and prune. Taste is again oak with bourbony alcohol, brown apple, and Fig Newton. This beer is just a bit syrupy, warming, and a little spicy. Not a bad rendition although one is plenty."
"Overall, a nice offering. Not the greatest thing ever made, but a solid and creative American Belgian, especially for the price point. The fact that it's sold in a can earns bonus points, but please use a glass. Cheers!"
"O: one I always pick up as soon as it is released. Very enjoyable and a good beer to have every now and then."
"No hop presence detected anywhere that I can detect and the beer is very nice to drink. I wish I had more than the 4 pack of cans of this tasty brew."
"PP (Price Point) - Picked it up for $8.79 for a four pack in a box, though the place I purchased it from it usually about %15 off of average retail amounts. Definitely delivers, proper quality and ABV bang for the buck!"
"O- I did not enjoy this beer and will not get it again. The kicker for me - the alochol was too in my face and the burn was annoying."
"O- a good beer that is quite good tasting, but suffers from being a little one dimensial. It is really, really sweet, and doesn't give me many Belgian qualities."
"D-Pretty rough, and very alcoholic beer that's just not my thing."
"Decent offering, and my favorite yet of the three variants by 21st Amendment I’ve consumed thus far. Perfect for a random cool spring night out by the grill, but I couldn’t see making this a staple."
"I have had this beer a couple of times now, at the brewery and at home out of the can. I found that it is actually a nice beer to pair a cigar with as well."
"Mouthfeel: I like how the beer feels in the mouth it is thick but still flows around the tongue beautifully."
"Taste is full-bodied and creamy in the mouthfeel. Touches of warming alcohol in the taste are present after dark roasty malts and caramel. Hops just barely add a smidge of balance that works well for the style. The taste I've noticed in other Begian styles, the belgian yeast strain, is present in this one and adds a uniqueness to this that sets it apart from other strong ales I've had. Good beer, doesn't disappoint for fans of 21st Amendment brewery."
"Notes: I will certainly need to try more from this brewery (this was my first) due to the excellent presentation that this one showed me tonight. I think that it is a bargain at this price too!"
"The taste of Monks Blood is sweet dark fruits such plums and raisins flood my mouth the yeast spice is very subdued clashing with the mulled sweetness of the malts and hint of figs. I am not detecting much oak or vanilla. There is good mouthfeel and I find this a very drinkable strong ale. Definitely worth picking up a few to explore."
"Final Thoughts: Wow. Alot going on in this. Alot. I was a little scared for this because of the lack of head, even though the head was a nice one despite size, but this is an amazing beer. I would drink this until my final breath. This has to be one of my favorites. Home run. Fireworks. Standing Applause. It might not be for everyone, but it sure is for me."
"O- I enjoyed this beer, it had quite the alcohol kick that I was not expecting, it let itself be known but it was not too much. I was hoping for some yeasty aromas and flavors to show up in this beer a little, but there were absent. Overall a pretty unique beer that kept me interested in this brewery."
"3.0 D: This isn't horrible, but it is solidly average. I think the adjuncts might have taken away from what would have been a better beer."
"Usually it's only popular styles with lower abvs - wheat beers, IPAs, etc. - that I see canned. It's always exciting to see a rarer style canned and ready for a hike."
"Overall, very much suprised and enjoyed, would buy again. Nice abv. touch."
"Pours a dark ruby red. Nice dark head. Aroma is boozy with dried fruits and a bit of funk. Flavor is very inviting. Dark cherries and booze with a bit of sour funk as well. Each sip warms the mouth and adds different flavors such as vanilla, plum and sour fruit. It ends just a little bitter which helps balance out the sweet fruit taste. This is a really nice brew. Best beer from a can I have ever had!"
"Finish: Bit of a dry on the end with a rich maltyness and back notes of a subtle bitter hop. Very sticky on the lips"
"Pours dark red with huge head. Smells of plums and cinnamon. Taste of plums, all this plum makes the beer very sweet. First taste I get alcohol then it subsides to the sweetness and sourness but I think the sour is very nice it's not overwhelming. Overall I really like it, the sweet, fruit, and sour notes really give it a nice kick and add a nice depth to the beer."
"Date: 5/19/2011"
"Thanks Tim!"
"It's not the best of its kind but the unique packaging, reasonable price, and friendly demeanor means it's one of my favorites, a beer I share with friends whenever possible."
"O: I would love to drink this one again. It's not my favorite Belgian strong by any means, but it is a wonderful beer."
"One can only wonder how this guy would age in the can. Perhaps I'll toss one in a dusty corner and forget about it for a few years!"
"Overall: Quite good. Wouldn't be pounding these back all night but it's great for what it is."
"+1 for being in an awesome CAN!"
"Poured out of the can to a goblet. A dark cherry red. A small amount of fluffy white head settled on top for about half of the beer. The nose is mainly sweet and fruity. A tangy sweetness. The flavor has a ton of sweetness dominated by raisins,figs and earthy red grape. There is a lot of sweetness but a good tingle of alcohol. I feel like there are a lot of leftover sugars."
"Not a bad beer, but certainly not a great BSDA."
"Overall a good beer, although aging it on the oak seems to have mellowed and muddled the flavors. I'd love to try this sans the aging on oak."
"Overall not that bad of a beer. it does have it's belgium characteristics but is also a little different than the usual."
"This beer pours a brown color with amber hues. The head is one inch in height, and recedes slowly into a small cap of lacing. The aroma is of figs, cherries, cinnamon, and sugar. The taste is very sweet with only a mild yeast character. In fact, the sweetness overpowers everything detected in the aroma but the figs. The mouthfeel is full bodied with a cloying texture, and low carbonation. Overall, this beer just doesn't do it for me. Perhaps, someone with a severe sweet tooth could find this beer desirable, but I can't see myself drinking it again."
"still, a great beer."
"Pours a mahogany brown with more noticeable red highlights when held against the light. Small bit of tan head gone quickly. Scent is filled with all things Belgian - banana, bubblegum, bready yeast, spice and dark fruit. Taste comes across as very muddled and earthen - none of the components of scent stand out particularly well against a backdrop of brown sugary sweet malt. Quite a bit of solventy alcohol, tannic woodyness and sharp bitterness prevent anything from shunning through. Medium bodied, appropriate carbonation. The listed ingredients made me very interested in trying this beer, but when they are hard to pinpoint under some harsh notes, it makes for a disappointing beer."
"T: sweet, spiced, very interesting; overtones of cherry, cinnamon, and anise; I can see why some may not like this flavor because it is both sweet and bitter (esp. in the aftertaste), but I personally enjoyed this transition"
"Overall, I really enjoy this beer though it does seem a bit rough. I would really like to try an aged version."
"This came damn near to being a drain-pour (in fact, I drain-poured the last quarter - a first for me). I continued on with the beer more to document exactly why I dislike it. Blech. The bitterness in the latter half of the flavor really kills this beer. I do NOT plan on drinking this again."
"O- nicely done with lots of belgian goodness would only want one of these in an evening but do want to have this several more times"
"SkÅL!"
"O: Pretty good. There are no off flavors. After the alcohol assault, your tongue is able to detect more depth to the beer towards the end of the glass."
"O: Overall, this is quite a tasty beer, easy to drink, I'd buy it again."
"It really is not that bad. But...it is far from great."
"Pours a deep reddish brown with a bit of a purple hue. One-finger coffee cream colored head. Decent lacing and retention. Aroma of plums, raisins, cherry, bit of spice. Flavor started off with a sweet burst of cherry initially. Dark fruits, dates, plum, sticky sweet bread malt before the spicy finish. Good amount of pepper to go along with the Belgian spices."
"Not red like you might imagine, but more of the brown of a Monk's Robe, keeping with the Abbey style. While the nose is nothing but sour, it would be nearly impossible to pick out all the subtleties. Cinnamon, vanilla, wood, caramel sweetness, clove spice, sweet malt. There is some sourness at first and at the very finish, but not as much as the smell would have you expect. A ton going on with this one, and at 8.3% ABV, by the time you figure it all out, you won't be able to figure anything!"
"O- Overall a decent brew that doesn't quite stack up against other more popular Belgian Darks."
"this beer comes in a can never thought i buy in a can, something diffrent tonite, it said belgian style ale brewed with cinnamon , vanilla and oak chips and dried figs, how can i say no , pours a drak red , with a taste from that get better as you drink it , banna , oak chips and vanilla , a bit diffrent then whay i usually drink but wow a great taste in my mouth gotta drink another so try it you may enjoy it"
"O - Not a bad beer, not great, but the taste was enjoyable."
"Overall a good beer but could use some subtlety."
"O - Very noble effort and possibly better with age to calm down the heat a little."
"drinkability: It's a interesting and pretty good beer, but it's not great by any means. figuring all the additives of flavor... it should be more complex and have better balance."
"All in all, I was really hoping this one would be stellar. The vanilla and oak chips seem kind of lost to me, with the fruitiness and belgian esters taking center stage. Admittedly, I'm not a huge bsda fan, so that could be part of the deal here, but I'm just not quite as impressed as I was hoping."
"This is a nice Belgian dark from 21st Amendment though it's not all that complex and lacks the body to be considered great."
"I'm certainly glad to have tasted this, but cannot say that I would hurry out to buy more. I've got a few more 21st Am beers I wish to try, ,but I'm beginning to wonder if their vision of craft beer in a can is little more than a gimmick."
"Very good BSDA with all the fruity esters one expects in the style, although it is lacking that signature Belgian yeast kick that others have."
"Biba!"
"Murky brown color. Very slight (too shallow) head. The aroma is of sweet malt, with a healthy dose of phenolic character. Some distant cheesy hops, and a backdrop of alcohol. The taste is of spice, malt and fruit...almost citric (kiwi or papaya like...interesting...). Interesting yeast character. The beer is full and moderately heavy. Nice boozy warming. For the style, this beer has a very low carbonation. Interesting and fun, but not a beer that I'd go out of my way to have again."
"A very dark, muddy mahogany with a thin ring of creamy head that lingers well and leaves nice lacing. The smell is of dark fruits and brown sugar. Sweet smelling with ripe banana and belgian yeast. prune, raisin, dark cherry, vanilla, carmaels, oak and cinnamon. Sweet caramels, vanilla, a touch of chocolate, dark fruits, canamon, brown sugar, and a touch of earthy tones. Very sweet. Delicious. Medium bodied and very drinkable."
"jd"
"Overall, an enjoyable member of the strong Belgian dark family. I'm not going to go out of my way to trade for more, but if I come across some in my travels, I would purchase this again. I do look forward to visiting my brother out in San Fran and trying this one at the brewery. I bet this beer would shine when it's super fresh."
"Overall: I have to say that this is a pretty delicious beer. I'm just sad that I only discovered it towards the end of March instead of February when it came out."
"D: Not super drinkable, but with a decent mouthfeel. The beer is just whatever at best."
"Overall I wasn't a big fan of this beer - there was a lot going on and the levels of each flavor didn't seem to be as they should be. Far from a bad beer but one not worth seeking."
"D - 2 cans is enough for one person, very filling and rich. It overall is like a better version of Rochefort 6. I just wish they aged it on oak for longer because I did not get much of the woody aspect."
"First impression is a strange one; the can is a very cool design, but it seems odd to be pouring a can into a Chimay chalice. Color is a tawny brown with a thin white head. Sweet aroma, although not terribly strong. Taste is very pleasant; fruity, mostly figs, with a bready, malty component that melds nicely with the fruity sweetness. Alcohol is very well hidden, and the beer goes down easily, if not terribly complex. Very enjoyable beer; wish we could get these cans in Connecticut to make for easy traveling."
"Initial sweetness gives way to dark raisin and spiciness with nice depth of flavors. Lightly bittered, the finish is slight alcohol heat, oak tannin, and spices linger on the palate."
"This is the first Belgian style I've had from a can, and it did not disappoint."
"A 12 ounce can picked up at the Beer Stop for $3. Poured into a wine glass. The ale appears a hazy copper color with a bit of crimson red in the light. Topped off with about an inch of creamy off with foam. Nose and flavors consist of sweet caramel, candied cherries and figs, cinnamon finally shows through as the ale warms. Lots of esters here. Mouthfeel is a tad dry with ample carbonation and a bittersweet finish."
"Overall: A nice albeit gussied up beer. The slight rise in carbonation aids in the overall drinkability of this one, though a bit less sweetness would be appreciated. Pretty enjoyable."
"Drinkability is on the lower side style wise. I knew I'd had this before and didn't like it, and am wondering why I bothered again. Fail."
"Pours a hazy orange-ish to deep amber color with a light tan head. In the aroma, Belgian candy sugar, dark fruits, especially raisin and fig. In the taste, raisin, figs, dark fruit, and a perfect hint of alcohol. A smooth and medium bodied mouthfeel, with a dry dark fruit and alcohol aftertaste. Nice dark fruit and alcohol presence, easy to drink, and quite tasty."
"Side note: BA says 21st is from San Francisco, CA, but my can of beer says it is from Cold Spring, MN. Dunno if it is contracted out or what, but I though that was interesting to note."
"Pours an un-see-thru mahogany brown. A tan head rears back after the 1st sip and becomes a ring. Smell is of the richer malts, plenty of fruitiness, fig and cherry. A smooth top, which may be the vanilla. Taste is golden: real raisins, dark berries, hard tack candies.. all sorts of goodness. A bitterness all the while fades amongst the back. A heat for the feel is dispelled by the utter smoothness of this beer. The oak is mild at best, and the cinnamon is only a smidge, thanks. Excellent beer here, one I wish to return to very soon. The best I've had in a can so far."
"I never know what to expect when someone says they're making a ""Belgian Ale"". I'm not sure if it will be 12% IPA or a porter on steriods. This on had a smooth start with a hint of hops. Carmel flavor as the maltiness comes through. Slightly bitter finish, but fine, even for a lager boy like me :-)"
"D/M: Very drinkable overall. Lighter than I was expecting but it really has a very nice complex flavor to it."
"Pours a deep reddish color like a grapefruit or almost a clear tomoto juice with a obe finger off white head whiches gives way to some lace. The aroma is very inviting big vanilla and cinnomon notes with hints of oak and spices. The taste had a big vanilla and cinnomon taste over top of the caramel malt backbone, but there was a metallic taste in the end to the after taste that was a little off. The mouthfeel was creamy and enjoyable. Over all it would be hard to have more than one or two there was a nice start to the flavor but it faultered toward the end."
"A cup of zest. Looks good, cloudy grapefruit. Tasty, very drinkable, licorice, cinammon. Sweetish from the yeast and cinammon, some dark fruit. Yeast and spice aromas.Not true to the style but fun, would have this again.Thank Mike D. for ringing it back, via Jason."
"Overall very nice beer. I was expecting an overpowering potpourri of flavors and aromas, this was rather subtle. Had to concentrate to pick out the particular elements."
"I should note that as this warmed, I picked up quite a bit of rubbing alcohol on the palate."
"D - I like this, is definitely a Belgium Strong Ale, good balance, smooth finish, nice lingering tastes to savor."
"Recommend it highly. Somewhere between a dubbel and a imperial stout. Glad to have 21st in MN."
"I was apprehensive about Monk's Blood, but 21st Amendment did a very credible job taking on the BSDA style. It's good, not great. It needs more strength on the nose, more Belgian yeast, and maybe even a bit more body. Nevertheless, it's well worth checking out. Good stuff."
"This is just a much better beer than i expected. must go back for more. Not sure how to compare to real Belgians but this is a fine brew."
"A good comparison is a Ommengang Abbey Ale with a spike of sweetness. Well Done!"
"Notes - A nice solid choice here. All the expected flavors of a BSDA but not too rich or syruppy. Medium bodied and pretty easy to drink. Well balanced."
"pours a dark brown color with a slight reddish hue. Small and lively tan head. decent lacing. smells of belgian spices, malt and a hint of cinnamon. taste is fairly basic. slight hint of cinnamon, almost like a dr. pepper. decent mouthfeel. Overall, this is a decent beer. a little basic in flavor, but a nice sipper."
"Overall this is a good Belgian Dubbel style ale, wouldn't classify it as a Belgian dark strong because it is lacking any of the dark fruitiness that complements that style. A bit sweet overall but still tasty; worth a taste if available."
"D: Low to moderate drinkability due to ABV."
"21 Amendment's Monk's Blood pours a medium brown, though the packaging says it is red in color. The beer has an initial sting of the high alcohol content. However, the end taste and aftertaste have a very complex feeling of both different fruits and spices, including cinnamon"
"Taste is extremely bready, moderate levels of cinnamon, brown sugar, medicinal black cherries. When warmed, the black cherries match up well with the now-apparent figs. Belgian yeast flavor is subtle but makes a break backbone. Cherry attaches to the palate with some caramel and slight bitterness. Carbonation is moderate and delightful. Certainly a low-heat sipper, which is actually best between 45-50ºF. The cherries lower the drinkability. Perhaps this would be tasty with dessert."
"This is medium bodied. The alcohol is present but not overpowering for the high 8.3% given on the can. Is not bitter to say the least."
"Not recalling much that tasted this good."
"Drinkability: Alright. Wouldn't want to drink again, but not too boozy or bothersome. Just unremarkable, boring and ultimately forgettable. You can do so much better in this style! Blah."
"12 ounce can. Served in a DFH Signature Glass, the beer pours a dark reddish/brown color with about a half inch light tan head. Head retention is decent, and there's a good amount of lacing left on the glass. Aroma is dark fruit (fig, raisin, cherry), cinnamon, candi sugar and vanilla. Taste is similar to the aroma, but there's the addition of some peppery spice and a bit of oak. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit creamy with good carbonation. Drinkability is OK, it's not hard to drink at all. I think it's a solid brew and worth trying."
"An rather excellent example of the rather ambiguous ""Belgian Strong Dark"" style, the figs employed in the brew really enhance the fig notes that would normally be present in such a beer; the vanilla, oak chips and cinnamon play a bit more of a background role, though, and likely are hidden mostly by the yeast character, though they do seem to add a slight bit of character. Though alcohol is not extremely well-hidden, it actually adds to the beer and gives it a bit more depth of flavor. Drinkability shouldn't really be an issue in the style, and this is definitely not worthy of drinking in multiples. Two servings max would be a blessing worthy of monastic servitude."
"D- this beer is okay, it is entirely too sweet and has too much banana, i can drink this but only to a certain extent, considering the style there are a lot better beers out there"
"D: This isn't too bad... it is certainly worth getting a four-pack or trying it on-tap. There are much better examples of this style, though."
"Pours a nice ruby color with almost a finger of head. Every whiff seems to bring a different smell to me. Tart cherry and some fig. This beer dances across the tongue nicely. Cherry blended with oak and the slightest hint of vanilla. I seem to get a tiny bit of tartness up front, then it quickly fades. Man, I remember not liking this when I had it on tap last year. For an 8.3% abv beer it goes down easily. Actually quite a nice brew. Certainly pick some up."
"Drinkability is decent. A little heavy but not too much. Tasty so it goes down easily."
"Drink again? Absolutely. A little pricey here at $4 a can, otherwise, I'd buy a case."
"D: This is not very complex but its fruitiness really spoils my palate."
"D: All the elements of a solid Belgian are here, but it just doesn't come together. For fanatics only."
"Not a bad beer at all, but if you're seeking a Belgian fix, why settle for this?"
"D: I know I am giving this a higher review than many others on here, but I found this brew very memorable and feel it flat out deserves high kudos!"
"$1.99 for a can (haven't seen a sixer in a while) and I'm sold. I'd love to age a few and see if it chills out and shows more character and less sweet."
"A solid beer. I don't pick up Belgian-styles to often, so, I'm glad this one was nice. I wouldn't have multiples of this in one night, but, I'd look for a single every now and then."
"Well done, 21'st. Keep brewing this one."
"D-very drinkable and my taste was gone in no time. Very drinkable especially considering abv..."
"This beer tastes a bit young and hot right now. Nice flavors, but the alcohol heat is enough to make me only want one. Seems like this beer could use a bit of age."
"Definition of average beer. Nothing speacial and every aspect mediocre."
"Totally drinkable beer, nice that it is in cans."
"Too sweet to drink and almost too sweet to even sip for my taste."
"will not need to try this again unless it is on draft...."
"D - Not too bad, and definitely will be picking up again, but isn't the best BSDA in existance. That being said, Unibroue's 4-pack pricing seems to keep going up to as high as $11 or $12 and at equivalent $4.50 per bomber, this beer is going to be a great budget Belgian!"
"D: Good. Interesting flavors and the 8.3% ABV is well-hidden in the taste. It's noted in the head though."
"Drinkability: Very good, but could not have more than two of these at a time. It's just that type of brew."
"D - A respectable enough offering, but average at best both in terms of the brewery and the style... 21st Amendment and the Belgian Strong Dark Ale style both have much more to offer... I would drink again in a pinch but would neither recommend or invest in a sixer..."
"D) Is it suppose to be, is it relevant? ... but yeah, it's kind of down there for me. I'd love to have another Brother Thelonius to compare; that's the only other belgian dark strong ale I think I have had and I can't remember it but I gave it high ratings."
"Having just founf out this was oak-aged (at the end of this review), it all makes sense now. It's an interesting idea, as it makes a typically sweet beer way over to the drier side. This is a great one to try and the most drinkable beer I've had with this ABV."
"Ending notes: A complex brew. Enjoyable while sipping. This brew had a lot of hype surround it and I can't say that it lived up to its expectations. I did enjoy it, and I would probably get it again, if I came across it and was looking for something a little different."
"D: Easy drinkability. Smooth and delicious!"
"D- Delicious brew to end the evening with, pick it up if you see, it can challenge authentic Belgian brew."
"Pours beautifully, dark amber with a textbook head that lingers and invites. Scents of burnt sugar and fruit with something slightly similar to yeasty, but not very strong. Flavor is good, malty and bitter with a sweet alcohol on the back of the throat. Mouthfeel is very nice and smooth, as is drinkability but not for all night, as this little doozy packs a punch. Overall this beer was right up my abbey (wow that was a bad joke)."
"D: This was not very Belgian, but it was a nice dark and malty ale. Great body, but it was fairly hot in the finish, so this needed to be sipped. Age really might help this one. It's decent fresh, but mostly enjoyable just for the novelty of drinking a BSDA out of a can."
"Deep mahogany with ruby red hihglights and a big soft, fluffy off-white head. Excellent retention that leaves beautiful sheets of sticky froth on the glass after each sip. Buttery smooth, thick syrupy feel. Lazy, light carbonation as the carbonation fights through this heavier bodied strong ale. Intense dark fruit aromas and flavors, figs and raisins. Aromas are mostly sweet with a bit of tartness masking the higher ABV. Intense seetness and flowery hoppy finish nicely hide the alcohol. Enjoyed this thoroughly. Definitely a sipper."
"Easy-drinking, perhaps too much so; this is a light-hearted take on a sober style, adventurously crafted at the expense of style guidelines. The best Belgian-style beer I can remember having out of a can though..."
" A Belgian dark ale from a can? Seems almost sacreligious! Although Belgian brewing monks should not be worried, this brew is a pretty fine offering of the style. Sip slowly and enjoy!"
"Very smooth mouthfeel, good level of carbonation. A touch of booze on the finish, but overall ABV is well hidden. Pleasant lingering finish."
"D - Well hidden ABV, good balance and nice flavors. It's not the greatness that is Chimay Blue, but it's pretty darn good"
"Monk's Blood is light on the tongue but a little less carbonated than I would think for the style. It is creamy throughout with a dry finish. Alcohol is noticeable but not overbearing. It is really a decent example of the style."
"D - Certainly not a session beer, but it's also not intended to be. A very good ""take your time"" beer. I may have to run out and buy more before it's sold out."
"also like the 4 pack packages it comes in...make for a good Xmas gift next year"
"D - Well, this is not my favorite. I don't like drinking it very much, and I don't think it's a good BSDA."
"Better than I was expecting. Big Heavy Sweet Beer. In no way a Session beer. But it is a Fun beer to have when it's around."
"I poured from a 12 ounce can into a snifter, deep brown pour with sticky 2 finger white head, light lacing. The aroma was full of cinamon, vanilla, and oak. Lots of cinamon, but not overpowering, vanilla, and dark fruit round it out. It has a lingering sweetness. The body is medium, well carbonated. A little different take on a Belgian and I liked it."
"Can poured into a glass. The pour is very dark and cloudy with a reddish hint. The taste is very smooth i was able to pick up the oak and the vanilla but i wasn't about to pick up cinnamon. Slightly sweet and good taste with a lingering aftertaste. Very drinkable for 8.3%."
"On tap at ChurchKey in Washington, DC. Poured into a snifter glass. Beer was served up near room temperature which is the norm for ChurchKey. Pours a cloudy, muddy dark red brown color. Small tan head but fizzles quick, but retains nice lacing throughout the session. Malty aroma, sweet dark malts, some dried fruits. The flavor starts off quite sweet and malty. Not sugary as such, but a bit sweet. Moderately balanced by a roasted maltiness and some warming alcohol. Dried fruits picking up in the flavor as well, along with a bit of Belgian yeast in the finish. There is also a tart fruit note in the finish, almost like a good kriek, albeit much more subtle. Medium bodied and decent carbonation throughout. Quite guaffable indeed."
"Quite tasty with a blend of flavors that may not have fully integrated, but they didn't exactly clash either. Wasn't expecting the dark fruit elements to dominate so much, but they blended fairly well with the vanilla. Didn't detect much overt oak chip character. Definitely worth trying at least once, although the sweetness became a bit much for my taste."
"The color was of a dark brown with a reddish hue. Foam was tan that disapated in a short time, but a medium amount of lace on the side of glass. The smell had a complex aroma of roasted malts, fruit and spices, with a hint of sweetness. The taste of roasted malts, complex spices and fruit (cinnamon, allspice, vanilla, fig, etc.) A nice balance of sweet & tart, with just a touch of sourness, to bring this ale to a nice balance of all component into one way above average beer."
"A little thinner than I would had liked with a little burn but not too bad overall. Not the best drinker in the world. Had with some friends that were not big beer guys and they didn't really enjoy this one, and I wasn't too impressed either, but it was interesting I'll give it that."
"sat down with a can and found it Has a very perfumy taste to it"
"This is a real good product I am impressed. Very high drinkability for me."
"21st Amendment really never ceases to amaze me. Been looking forward to copping this Seasonal Brew and I'm so glad I did, County Wide in Valley Stream just got it in. Nice head with an average smell, nothing special in that department. Great tasting though and very drinkable for a beer with ~8%, already on my second can. Appearance wise it's a nice dark ruby red and like I said very drinkable. I just had my first can with an Italian Sub and enjoyed every bite, def. a good beer to have with food. Nothing really to complain about. Slightly sweet aftertaste."
"D - Very good Belgian-style beer. The yeast is well-done and the subtle nuances beg for another sip. A great brew all around!"
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, good kick, good representation of style, it's a decent beer to drink for a while but there are others in the style that I would choose first."
"D: Not my favorite."
"D- Overall, not a bad taste for the value- and interesting a repeatable ale that's I'd likely gravitate toward over the Christmas Holiday."
"Reviewed on 4/15/2010. Can. Pours a clear dark brown with a small white head. Aroma of sugary malt, soda, vegetal spices. Flavor of sweet, candy-like malt (like Sour patch kids), super sweet with some fruity notes. Very sugary and a touch of sour. Wow, really weird quad. Nothing really comes out except the sugary sweet candy-like notes. Sugar bomb."
"drinkable - perhaps one or two."
"Overall, this is an interesting twist on the Belgian style; it is similar enough, yet with its own character. One of the tastiest canned beers I've tasted to date!"
"Fairly tasty, but the low carbonation doesn't do the beer justice. And the can thing? Not so much."
"Overall, an interesting brew. Something is very strange about pouring a can of Belgian beer but its still damn tasty. I definitely recommend it."
"When I poured it into my DFH Glass, It looked like Cherry cola, But seamed to darken to a Clear Brown with a ruby hue.Creamy light tan head about 1/4"" high. Aroma is very slight. Pleasant flavor. Light sweetness with some hop bitterness. light body for an 8%. Clean palate. Not bad for an over all beer, but not something that stands out leagues above other trappist-style beer. Won't seek it out, but will buy it if the mood strikes."
"Overall - Definitely a dynamic beer. I recommend serving it at 50°F and enjoy it up to 60°F. Thanks again BJ! This is a great nightcap!"
"D) A well crafted Belgian brew - in a can!"
"Monk's Blood is a wonderful first effort at Belgian-style ale from 21st Amendment and is my favorite (so far) of their canned beers. By traveling to Belgium and learning at the feet of the masters, the brewers showed the BSDA style the respect it deserves. And they deserve respect for the end result."
"One finger of light brown head, very quick dissipation with minimal lacing on top of dark brown body with garnet highlights, a bit of visible carbonation when held up closely to bright light. Nose is fairly sweet, plums raisins, a bit of spice, and some floral hops. Taste mirror the nose, the plum esters predominate. Mouthfeel is on the full side, not a lot of effervescence, with a fairly dry finish. Certainly the best BSDA I've had in a can, but I was a bit perplexed to see this was contract brewed in Maryland. What gives on that??? Pretty wicked alcohol kick minimizes drinkability, one shared is sufficient. While I like the convenience of cans, I'll pass next time."
"Cheers!"
"Drinkability - the first Belgian style I've had in a can, and one of the best canned beers, period."
"Overall, this is decent but very unimpressive, a heavy beer with little character and less complexity to warrant such heaviness."
"This one pours a dark brown with garnet fringes adorned with a tan foamy head. The malty aroma is very enjoyable to myself. It smells to me of banana, coriander, cinnamon, and brown sugar. The taste however is mainly of the banana and clove from the Belgian yeasts used. There is a booze flavor to it that can be detected through the clove. The best part of the flavor is definitely the aftertaste which comprises of mainly a marshmallow flavor. When combined with the caramel and chocolate malts it gives it an aftertaste that seems almost to be like a s'more. This is really a very tasty brew and even at it's higher ABV, I feel that it's rather smooth and easily drinkable."
"M/D - Somewhat thin mouthfeel on this beer, but it does come off velvety, which is nice. Overall, an interesting interpretation on a Belgian dark ale, but it could pack more malt flavor inside."
"D - Very good drinkability. ABV is masked very well. Despite being a sweet beer, it is very easy to go back for another sip."
"overall not bad. i could drink it without issue but there is nothing really calling me back to it again."
"Drinks pretty easy for the ABV & style, but more of a good entree' to the style versus a great example..."
"D - Just cant get past the smell. Its horrific! Definate drain pour this can is. Very shocked. I was pretty sure I had drank this before and liked it so I went after a lone can of this. Just must have been a rotten can. This should be much lower rated, but I remember how good this was. Would probably be mostly 4's or so if I had a different can."
"Future outlook: An enjoyable beer that could use some slight tweaking to make really good. First BSDA I've ever had in a can, and I'm inclined to snag a few sometime to see how they age."
"D. I can easily say this is the best canned BSDA I have ever had. Easy drinking. Nice mix of spice flavors and dark fruit."
"Medium bodied brew with a light level of carbonation. This is quite an easy drinking brew. There is a lingering flavor somewhat like vanilla. Slightly drying as it warms and the spice character starts to stick to the tongue. The spices tasting increasingly more like a bland grated cinnamon hang in the mouth increasing it's drying aspect. This cinnamon flavor is a bit out of place and brings out more of the belgian yeast flavor that tastes a bit green."
"Got this one as an extra in a trade, and a very fine extra it was! The revisit was also obtained in a trade, and I was quite happy to have it again!"
"T:"
"Drinkability: It's not bad, and I kind of dig it, but I do wish the scents and flavors were much more potent and robust, and with an ABV of 8.3% and the slight lack of flavors, it wouldn't be worth drinking more than one in a sitting. Definitely worth a shot though, especially for something that comes in a can."
"A bit too smooth for a Belgian, in my opinion. It did make it very easy to drink, though. Though this beer wasn't my favorite, I would certainly drink it again."
"Drinkability: An enjoyable beer, it has some nice flavor that doesn't go overboard. A great beer to relax with and take the edge off the day. Try it if you can get it."
"Thought this one was a little too thin and just a touch overcarbonated. Overall a good american style belgian. Glad to have tried and wish I had regular access."
"Not bad, but like I said, kind of generic. Not sure the booze is worth the pay-off."
"Poured this into a tulip. Pours a dark ruby color with a rocky light tan head that is about a finger and a half. Decent head retention on this beer. I smell dark fruits; mainly cherries come to mind. Vanilla a hint of alcohol run through my nostrils. but I mostly smell cherries. Also a spice that I couldn't quite pinpoint until I read the can. Cinnamon. That's what I'm smelling, but it's faint. Rich malts and dark fruits dominate my pallet on this. A caramel sweetness is present and it finishes with just a little spiciness from the cinnamon and a touch vanilla. This is very rich and the flavors are nicely layered. Decent mouth feel, the body is a little lighter than I would expect and the spiciness from the cinnamon detracts a little bit, but nothing overly offensive. Glad I chose this as a night cap."
"An interesting read on the outside, an interesting concoction on the inside. It pours a very dark garnet-brown topped by a half-finger of ecru foam. The nose comprises figs, dark roasted malts, raisins, and a bit of oak. The taste holds notes of everything listed above, along with brown sugar and some bitter chocolate powder. The body is a heavy medium, with a light carbonation and a thick, almost chewy feel. Overall, a strong Belgian, especially considering its aluminum origins (such has been my experience). Get some!"
"The nose is woody and oaken, with plenty of ABV and raisins, and slightly rum soaked florals coming through. The taste is really complex, with a slighly different experience with each taste. This is a full bodied, Belgian dark, with lots of ABV, wooden and oaken notes, lots of spices, lots of candied sugars and probably some brown sugar too. This is a really malted up affair. There are slighly booze soaked fig or raisin notes, there are almost some nutty flavors coming through too. There is a nice dash of vanilla, although I'm not getting much cinnamon as the label proclaims. The oaky almost cherrywood flavors are the most pronounced. This is a really fine beer. The aftertaste is fairly modest, all things considered. Worth seeking out. L'Chaim."
"Drinkability is pretty good. I think a drier finish would certainly help, and maybe try to lose the alcohol presence a touch."
"This brew is a little too sweet for me to enjoy more than one or two on any given night. The fruits and spices and vanilla all make it feel like late fall or early winter, somewhere between Thanksgiving and Christmas. I would gladly sip another sometime when the weather cools down."
"D: definitely the most interesting beer I've tried out of a can to date, very complex- but its at the expense of balance"
" if this was from Belgium and in a bottle i would be completely unimpressed, but its from the USA and in a can so its pretty good especially because its in a can"
"We went back to the two places where we bought it, and it was sold out. Very disappointing."
"Poured into a chalice. Looks a bit hazy, deep reddish brown with a fine beige cap. Sticky, spotty lacing. The aroma was heavy on malts and fruits - bread and toffee, raisins and figs, earthy, slight alcohol, brown sugar and cocoa. Sweet toffee flavour up front, spicy notes appear mid-palate along with dried fruits with a fair bit of alcohol and grain character bringing up the rear. It's not immediately clear to me whether the flavours are just subtle, or are a little thin when compared to the aroma, but it's pretty mild tasting overall. Full bodied with very fine carbonation, alcohol warmth, decent texture. Not bad, but a little underwhelming. After getting through the full can, it seems like the flavour just didn't come together for me - too much alcohol for the rest of the flavour profile."
"Monk's Blood... Great name. And a great story on the can. Unfortunately, a lot of the flavors the list on the can are quite subdued all around and you're left with a decent strong dark ale in a can. Easily something to take along with you somewhere but otherwise nothing too outstanding."
"I didn't really love this one. Aroma was pretty subdued and taste was nothing special. My first 21st Amendment beer was a 'miss'."
"Comments: My first review of a beer in a can. Overall, a good beer that brings forth some nice elements. However, I really think monk's blood should be served in a bottle. In my opinion, some beers and styles just seem to lend themselves to certain containers."
"D - Well at 4 dollars a can or 50 dollars a case, PA is pretty strict when enjoying this beer in say a reasonable 10 dollars a four pack. Ow well some day yet great brew."
"Great beer that I really enjoy. Thank you to the threewisemen for the trade"
"Sampled on 12/18/2009. This Belgian Quadruple pours a medium brown color with some very nice ruby highlights. Medium sized tan foamy head, with nice lacing and good retention. The aroma is fruity, caramel, spicy and sweet. A medium bodied quadruple. The malts are fruity and sweet. There is a hint of figs and some vanilla. The hops are earthy. Nice balance. It has that Belgian sweetness (candi sugar?) yet it doesn't have that estery yeasty flavor. Nice beer, sweet without being cloying. The cinnamon shows up at the finish. A nice quad in a can. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is sweet."
"D - I thought this was a pretty nice beer overall. The nose and taste were reasonably complex, in my opinion."
"D: It was certainly complex, but not necessarily enjoyable. Perhaps it's a style thing, but I'm not sure that I'll buy this again."
"Poured mahogany in color with a thin, creamy cap. Nose reveals figs with a hint of spice - definitely on target for the style. Taste consistent with nose with perhaps a hint of cocoa. Mouthfeel was medium-light with an easy carbonation and a slightly dry finish. Style consistent and drinks quite easy at 8.30%. Who knew a Belgian Strong Dark in a can could taste so good."
"Flavor is as expected, with the same notes, but here the cinnamon gets a bit overwhelming. The first few sips are pleasant, a nice twist on the style, but by half glass it gets to be a bit too much, and drinkability suffers, a lot."
"Really does look like blood when poured-a deep coppery, pale blood color. Malty and somewhat metallic aroma. Very solid malt flavor-hints of spices. Long lingering sweetness. Somewhat of a port flavor in the backround. Good full body-has a sweet, sticky, slickness to it. A really good beer overall. Some might find it too sweet or perhaps almost too full bodied but I like it. Nice US example of a Belgian."
"D- Awesome to drink a Belgian Dubbel in a can, not my every day session beer for sure. More of my once in a while drinker. Surely have had better Dubbel's , but solid beer for sure."
"Pours from the can a muddy dark brown color, topped off with a dollop of medium-brown foam. Somewhat winey on the nose, with raisins, prunes and brown sugar. Flavors of caramel, brown sugar, dark fruits, vanilla and oak. A nice example of the style, and another good argument in favor of canned beers."
"M/D: Medium to lighter mouthfeel. Somewhat smooth, carbonation is average. Drinkability isn't the best, it just doesn't do much for me. Its worth a try, but I won't be trying this again."
"One of the worst Belgian style beers I've ever had. Worse than Leffe Blonde (which I hate), and insultingly priced at $3 a can--I wouldn't pay $3 for a 6pack of this. In fact, had I gotten this as a 4- or 6-pack, I would probably have sent most of it back to the brewery with an angry letter."
"Notes - While smooth the beer wasn't highly drinkable."
"Poured into a chalice a nice dark reddish color, nice carbonation, nice little creamy tan head, with some sticky lacing to follow. The nose is malty, slight yeast, slight vanilla, figs, plums, raisins, very slight cinnamon. The taste is malty, with some yeast notes, slight vanilla, dark fruits, very slight cinnamon. Medium body, the brew has a weird consistency, with a dry finish. Drinkable, this is a nice brew, finally got a chance to try it. Thanks Wayne."
"Wasn't too sure about this when I saw the list of ingredients on the label, but they balanced the flavors well."
"Medium body, lower carbonation. Some warmth from alcohol. A nice balance here, some complexity. Nice beer."
"Poured into 10oz glass. The beer poured a clear reddish brown color with a tan head that had OK retention and lacing. there was a sweet malty scent with some spice and fruit. The flavor also had slightly fruity, slightly sweet and malty taste with a bit of a tart finish. The body was full and smooth with a slightly sticky finish.The drinkability was typical for the style. Overall, a pretty typical example of the style."
"D: For a Belgian in a can, pretty solid. Worth picking up again for the price."
"This is truly a treat to drink and the 8.5% is well hidden. The finish is super sharp and dry with a lingering fig character on the palate."
"D-Nice beer. I think this is more like a big dubbel than a dark strong. This beer would open up with more carbonation. It would kick up the aroma and flavor a bit and make it seem drier. All and all a nice beer."
"I wanted to like this beer. It sounded so good!"
"Overall, a pretty decent beer. I think the fact that it is canned gives this beer a leg up on other beers with similar quality. Definitely may find it's way into my golf bag this summer."
"D: I think this would go great with a hearty meal, or stands up well by itself. Despite the 8.3 ABV, was very smooth -- could drink more than one of these. The cans would make it ideal for some place where bottles are prohibited like a pool, etc."
"Drinkability: This is a very nice example of a Belgian Strong Ale that somehow manages to be full-flavored yet easy to drink, while also masking its high alcohol quite well."
"Decent brew."
"D: Good, not amazing. But good. I have had this twice now, and really enjoy it, but I feel like the cinnamon, oak, and vanilla get lost. And there are a lot of other brews in this style that are excellent."
"Flavor very much like the aroma. Very dry anhydrous finish, bitter hops and long finish. Fig, and plum lead the way, alcohol burn in the chest, bitey carbonation and black cherry. Mouth is just kinda blah on this one very homebrew like."
"This is pretty tasty stuff, although as I've said a few times, with the various ingredients they list on the can it seems like it should be more complex than it is. It's also pretty lacking in any character that seems ""Belgian."" All that said, it's still pretty tasty and worth picking up."
"This one didn't disapoint. Great pairing of sweet and sour from a belgian ale. Proves great craft beer does come in a can."
"Overall - an excellent American example of a Belgian style, and at the price it goes for, a steal of a deal! (It's like half the cost or sometimes less than the actual Belgian examples). Will be buying more of this. Prost!"
"D-Very well done...I love the abundance of dark fruit like flavors and the creamy texture to this."
"D: Well balanced, rather light, but nice kick to it. Sits well on the tongue and goes down easily. Not one to kick back with all night, but a nice beer to sit and enjoy one or two."
"This dark belgian is brewed with 8 malts, Belgian candi sugar, cinnamon, vanilla bean, dried local black mission figs and aged in oak barrels. Now this wasn't the first time I have had this beer- I have been enjoying it since it has come out but I have finally been able to take some notes on it last weekend. It poured a dark mahogany. It smelled like cinnamon, prunes, dates and some cereal malts. It tasted like caramel, roasted malt, figs, stewed raisins, molasses and some cinnamon spiciness. Ironically this beer is quite light bodied for 8.3%. It goes down easily and with much enjoyment on my part. Kudos!"
"Drinkability - I might have another if the price was right. Not a very drinkable beer, in that I could not drink one after another. But hey, it has 8.3% abv, not many beers at that high of an alcohol content would be. My opinion: not bad, not great, worth trying again on tap."
"D -- Very drinkable and approachable even for the uninitiated. Solid brew all around. Outside of brand whores, I would recommend this to anyone."
"another great beer sent my way by an ever so courteous friend..."
"The mouthfeel is fairly substantial and a little bit on the heavier side. All in all, I would recommend this beer, but by no means would I point to this as best within style. OLE!"
"The flavor isn't quite as immersive as the smell, but it still shows off a lot of tricks. Bread and earth flavors are complemented by some really nice plum and toffee sweetness and even some light fruit notes at the end. The finish shows a bit more alcohol than some of the champions of the style, but it is still relatively smooth for an 8.3% beer. There is a trace of vanilla and spice in the background, but otherwise some of the complexity that showed up on the nose didn't arrive when it came time for the main event. One word of advice: the beer definitely opens up as it approaches room temperature, so try to be patient. Seems like you could work out some really good food pairings with this one(duck?, coq au vin?). On it's own, Monk's Blood is a perfectly fine evening sipper."
"D-this is quite boozy and seems a little all over the place in terms of taste. The flavors are there to be solid but they don't blend well together."
"Mouthfeel is medium heavy bodied and has a smooth carbonation."
"D: This is a beer to sip and enjoy"
"D - Very drinkable for a Belgian Strong Dark Ale. Light on the palate and I could even drink this on a hot summer day."
"Drinkability is average. I don't really like this too much personally, but it's a unique beer."
"There's so much stuff in this beer, it's no wonder it lacks some of the more familiar/traditional traits of a strong Belgian dark. I expected something different, and didn't even like it at first, but it grew on me. It certainly doesn't offer up its secrets with the first few sips. Anyone into adventurous brewing and overall complexity should check this out."
"Drinkability - for such a high ABV (8.3) the drinkability is very good. I could waste 4 cans of this stuff and still want more. 21st Ammendment is on to something."
"D: Okay, I was expecting more, but it is a solid offering. Bonus points for being in a can."
"A very unique take, this beer offers a lot to like but the tartness in the taste doesn't seem to fit. Pretty good, worth trying, but maybe a case of experimentation giving off slightly different results than expected."
"Jesus Christ, what is this shit? Well, that was my initial reaction, but as I revisit this, what I'm struck by is the massive fig character of this beer, just so in your face. With a big fruity character, there's also some cherry juice and a mild tartness. Oak and vanilla appear mid-palate with a moderate grainy astringency. Quite cola-like, this is drying on the finish with a blend of cherry juice and figs, this is not particularly exciting. Medium-light in body with a high level of carbonation, this is a passable attempt at a Belgian dark, but it lacks nuance, complexity and enjoyability."
"Dark amber with some orange highlights topped off with an inch high khaki colored head that left light lacing on the glass. Strong alcohol upon first smell, but it followed up by some cinnamon, vanilla, and Belgian yeast. Taste is stronger than what I expected. Lots of different things going on here, sweet, oaky, with a touch of vanilla and some very soft vanilla. Not picking up on too much figs, but there's a definitely a dark fruity background. The alcohol is a bit hot, however. I think this one will actually age pretty well as some of the additional flavorings added will fade and the alcohol will mellow. Medium bodied, amost creamy with light carbonation. Not a bad brew. I'm going to let a few cans of this sit in my basement for a few months and see where it goes."
"D= Pretty good. This beer is sort of candy like and I have a tough time explaining it but I like it. I feel like the lower carbonation really fits this beer despite not fitting to the Belgian style."
"VERY drinkable. While you drink this it is so mild you don't think there is any alcohol in it. Dangerously tasty."
"Also, really dig the can -- awesome art/labeling."
"Sweet, medium bodied, carbonation is decent. The alcohol is not well hidden. Still a tasty, drinkable brew, but a few notches below the better beers in this category."
"The most noticeable taste is the malty sweetness. It is a little boozy but not too much. There is a bit of clove after the initial taste. Definitely worth a try."
"Drinkability: this beer just doesn't come together for me. It's far from bad, but it has a few problems for which its redeeming qualities fail to compensate. I won't seek it out again, at least not this year, but I won't outright knock it, either."
"So what is this bloody beer anyway? Well, to start with, it kinda looks like blood. It is a brownish red colour like a blood stain that has been through the wash. This ale has little to no head, and no lacing (though I must admit I'm not sure my glass is ""beer clean"" tonight) The aroma is kinda like a rotten fruit, in a good way. Figs, some citrus and vanilla are in the aroma and the flavour. The yeast is very strong and present with only a slight bitterness from the hops. Well balanced and odd. So odd, I think I like it!"
"Drinkability- Tastes fresh and lively thanks to the storage vessel. Proof that any style benefits from being canned."
"D- Very nice ale, I drank the 21st I.P.A.before this one, which really made this Monks Blood stand out with it's different style."
"Poured from a 12 oz. can. Has a dark amber color with a 1/2 inch head. Smells of dark fruits and spices. Taste is like it smells, dark fruit and spices, some notes of alcohol. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and has average drinkability. Overall this is a good quality beer."
"F: Finishes still pretty sweet with more brown sugar and fruit. Some strange bitterness comes through on the finish too, but its a somewhat unpleasant bitterness. The sweetness, syrup, and brown sugar never wants to go away. That is probably the only downfall of this beer. I wonder if it will mellow as it ages. With how sweet it is, it makes it a tough drink actually."
"This was my first try with 21st Amendment Brewery, they make a good beer and have changed my views on canned beers."
"Hoppy taste, too. Perhaps a bit much for the style, as citrus and pine override much of the caramel and dark fruit sweetness. Drying on the finish, without much of an aftertaste beside a flash of nuttiness and a sourish, near-medicinal booze note. Medium, highly carbonated body with a slick finish that drinks well for the style. All in all, 21st Amendment has crafted an interesting take on the Belgian Strong Dark Ale, but I might pass on this in favor of the originals of the style (Gulden Draak, Chimay, etc.). Still, definitely worth a try."
"Dark iron rich blood appearance. Bubbly beige head has some stick to it. rum, figs, raisins, cinnamon, tree bark. Lots of stuff going on here in the nose. Same on the buds. Lots of flavors and depth. Cherry based fig backbone. Cinnamon and vanilla accent nicely. Raisins. Woodiness. Fairly sweet, but not overly so. This is good. I'd give it a 4.25 in flavor if I could, but this is on the 4 side o fit rather than the 4.5 side of it. Mouthfeel is very even keel. Lightly carbonated and the alcohol is hidden quite nicely."
"D - Pretty nice. It has the advantage of being on the lower ABV end for the style, which definitely makes having more than one manageable. Monk's Blood offers up a lot of complexity and a mildness that I associate with the Rochefort lineup."
"D - Very good balance, good carbonation, not to sweet and it certainly goes down easy. I can see this 4 pack going down in one night, but only if you are looking to do some chanting of your own. I could easily drink and enjoy two, but I would recommend you stop there. Respect this very fine brew, don't pound all 4 in a one session."
" The sweet dark roasty flavors combine to hide the 8.5% that slides by and warms the belly. Smells of sourdough bread fill the nose with the fruity esters of the Belgian yeast. Caramel and plums, raisins and honeydew melon. There is a slight sourness i just can not peg. This is a full flavored ale that coats the mouth thickly lasting only long enough to remind of how well the last sip went down before committing to another."
"Poured a brownish color, tints of red, with decent head that left some lace. A semi-sweet smell of minor sugary malt along with some tart fruits for a balanced aroma, although the typical Belgian yeast/orange smell I find in most ales is lacking. Medium-bodied beer that has a mix of tart fruit and some citric notes along with hints of caramel malt and some stickiness to it. Gets a tad too sticky and becomes chewey but other than that this is an easy drinker but just a tad too mellow for my liking."
"to a snifter, probably around 40 degrees."
"Appears a deep crimson mahogany red hue with light tan head and speckled lacing surrounding the sides of my Allagash chalice. Light beige head with thin speckled lacing. Aroma has a sweet sugar backing with hints of vanilla and spice. Sharp sweetness filled with raisins and plum, and I guess fig additions according to my can. A touch of cider like notes to it, very cohesive with mellow booze. Flavor is nice slightly acidic with raisins and figs exchanging strokes of flavor ample bitterness to balance it out, and a touch of mellow alcohol in the finish this brew from a can for 8 bucks a 4 pack equates to a good deal. Mouthfeel is medium to fuller bodied with slightly sticky edges a nice all around drinking experience especially for a canned strong Belgian style dark ale. Drinkability was solid a beer I will revisit during the next three cans offered by this small brewer."
"M + D: It has quite a robust body, giving it almost a chewy mouthfeel, but falling a little short of that. A nice 'end of the night' beer that has served well as my nightcap. Not bad at all!"
"This is a tale of a sweet, rich beer. Here, I can detect the slightest of hop bitterness. Lots of sweet cola flavor. The alcohol doesn't show up until the swallow. Very true to the style even with the oily body."
"This is a solid offering. Nothing mind blowing but certainly not weak by any means. I look forward to trying more 21A in the future."
"92/100"
"Other comments: I've got a bone to pick with the can/package design because you can barely read it! The font and white-on-black makes it almost illegible."
"With how sweet this beer is I can't see myself throwing a lot of these back, the one I had however was very easy to drink..."
"Monk's Blood is a Belgian-style dark ale, brewed with dark candi sugar, cinnamon, vanilla, and dried dark figs; it's aged on oak chips to add in some woody flavors as well. I'd say it's roughly in the style of a dubbel, though its 8.3% ABV pushes it toward being a Belgian Dark Strong Ale, like the Chimay Grande Reserve or Rochefort 10. It pours a deep, rich brown, with a rocky tan head. The aroma speaks of the spices and the figs, perhaps with a touch of alcohol. On the tongue, it is gratifyingly complex, with the dark figs very evident. Perhaps a little too evident, as they make the beer seem a bit too sweet. The Amarillo hops give it a few citrusy notes, something you don't really expect for this style, but not unpleasant. It finishes slightly thin, but it is still delicious and very drinkable."
"Good beer."
"Body is full, slight silken quality, medium carbonation, not too high, though it doesn't feel like the bottle conditioned smoothness I prefer a Belgian ale. This is a tasty beer, and in the world of Belgian dark ales it is not as phenolic and quite drinkable for me."
"4/3/3.5/4/4.5"
"Drinkability is fine, alcohol is not hidden but it's not in your face apparent and it's not a beer that I'd drink two of at a time but would have one at another time. It doesn't seem like any other BSDA though fits some characteristics. I would recommend giving it a try though it may not please a lot of people."
"Very nice. Definitely one to share with wine-snob friends who think beer lacks character, especially coming from a can! Maybe a little too busy to drink many of, but it is quite an accomplishment."
"Easy enough to drink for a beer as heavy as this style is. Definitely one to try, but maybe more of one to share."
"A fine, fine beer, though it falls short of the upper tier of the style. It's certainly worth trying if you come across it, and lovers of the style should consider seeking it out. A nice choice!"
"Pours a very rich, garnet red color which easily makes one think of the beer's name right away. A joyous bouquet of fruits such as grapes and plums mixes with spices and earthy aromas of malt. Very inviting in the mouth as the tartiness of the fruits combines with the malt to balance out perfectly. An aftertaste of plums and chocolate or maybe cocoa beans keeps the bigness of the alcohol well hidden. Goes down very easily with a crisp, fruity, slightly tangy finish. Very enjoyable!!!"
"The flavor is lightly and pleasantly sour with a bready malt foundation and a prominent dark fruit presence in the form of plums, grapes, prunes, figs, and dates. Cocoa is evident, and alcohol is well hidden. Alcohol is most noticeable in the lightly tart dark fruit finish. A solid Belgian Strong Dark."
"How Healthy!!!"
"D: Quite delicious, easily drinkable and the alcohol is hidden well on the palate."
"Overall, this was a rather drinkable beer considering the ABV, the main thing that's stopping me from having another one right away is the sweetness. This style category is pretty competitve, and this probably isn't my favorite, but I'll certainly have it again, and I'm happy I still have three cans left."
"On the tongue: A heavy smothering of sweet rhubarb and cherry filling catch me by surprise on the first sip. Not sure I want to go back for a second sip of this ""pie""... but I do and I find it better with each. Sweet, hot and messy... but also full and complex. Minced meat, flaky dough and raisins. Opens up into some tantalizing smoky and tart notes towards the back of the tongue. There is salvation in that finish, providing enough dry balance to render the glass palatable. The echoes of darker fruit are promising, but never fully develop. For each weakness there is a strength here. One of it's strengths is the full feel of carbonation and body, without too much coating."
"d - I really liked this dark ale. It not only looked, smelled, and felt great, but had a very complex taste that was unique, but tasty. I would definitely try this again."
"Poured a dark reddish brown with good carbonation and a small white head Nose is dark fruits. Taste is grapes, booze, rum, figs, raisins and very good at that. Alcohol definitely shows through towards the end. Very goos overall and would drink again and recommend."
"I also really like 21st Amendments canning process. They are bringing back the can and putting craft beer in it. Respect!"
"Would I buy more of it? - possibly, this is a great canned beer with a very unique taste."
"D: Perhaps my expectations were a bit too high for this one. I found it to be alright, but not amazing, and the alcohol presence doesn't really make me want to drink a significant amount of this."
"Drinkability: A nice malty, bready Belgian treat that I want more of. The alcohol is there but not overpowering. The best of what they have sent east so far."
"D - Easy drinking, moderate ABV from a can with tons of flavor. Can't go wrong here."
"D: A great creation on the American side and perfect cordial style beer."
"Drinkability: Pouring it. I tried to give it chance and kept tasting it over an hour or so. This seems like a different beer than what everyone else is reviewing, so I assume this is a bad can. How ""can"" that be?"
"I tried this at the 21st amendment brewery on Tap as well and found the can to have slightly higher carbonation and sour punch in the end. Overall i found this to be a wonderful beer that i will stockpile assuming it ages well. Perhaps its my naivete or lack of experience/knowledge with BSDA's but i think you will regret not trying this one."
"D: Light bodied and not overwhelmingly complex, this is not close to a good representation of the style. Its not bad by any means but I expect a lot more complexity and exhilaration from a BSDA. No Belgian yeast flavor or nose, no complex fruitness, no life in this one. I'm not gonna have this one again."
"Note: I would recommend that everyone try this at least once."
"Not a bad beer. A different and interesting attempt from 21st that I may revisit."
"Pours dark red/brown with a khaki head. The aroma is a mix of dark fruit (figs, prunes) with a sour note, not what I was expecting but still a good smell. The flavor is more of the same with dark fruit and vanilla with some sour aspects, but not quite as much sourness as was in the aroma. The vanilla is strong in the aftertaste. Medium mouthfeel and lower carbonation."
"Overall this was a refreshing take on the style, but this on-tap version lacked the exceptional creamy mouthfeel that was present from out of the canl. Another impressive offering from 21st Amendment joining their IPA and Back in Black. I would go with the canned version if given the option."
"D-Nice stuff with plenty of flavour. Solid Belgian dubbel like notes. A tasty brew that is certainly the best offering from 21st Amendment that I have had."
"So what's in the fridge to drink during a Sunday afternoon of football? Ah, a can of Monk's Blood, and there's something all too appealing about craking open an aluminum tin of high-grade craft brew. Typically dark-ish and unassuming in its look, no head to speak of, with a withdrawn but unusal nose of grape soda and gummy cola bottles. There's a neat prune taste in the background which gives it an overall Dr Pepper quality, like a Beer Soda theme that could benefit from a little more carbonation. Does it go well with the wasabi peanuts and straight-out-the-package deli ham slice I'm ""pairing"" it with? How should I know, and who the hell are you to ask?"
"Overall I like the attempt of an American Belgian in a can but the wide array of spices was a little too much for me. Not a bad attempt and I applaud the effort and hope to see more ale (all kinds) in cans someday."
"Taste: Like a black forest cake. Initially sour but then becomes quite sweet with some cherry and ripe fruits along with brow sugar, but then this is partially balanced out by bitterness. However, a third, very interesting wave of dark chocolate dries the palette up nicely. Medium body. Finish lingers for a very long time and is really delicious, chocolate, bitter, and cherry. Unfortunately however, as the beer warms it loses much of the interesting character except for the sweetness and becomes quite cloying. However, its quite tasty cold."
" I enjoyed the beer very much but found myself looking forward to switching to something else toward the end of the glass."
"M/D - a very nicely blended brew, good carbonation and smooth mouthfeel, nothing too heavy and the flavor is complex, definitely leaves you wanting more. Maybe a little too sweet for me to have alot of it, but no complaints here."
"From the CAN: ""Legend has it that in the evenings, the monks would retire to their chambers & settle in with a few passages from the Good Book. But Brothers Nicolas and O'Sullivan had other plans. Working in the brewhouse all day, they were forced to repeat the same old recipes the elder monks had unveiled years before. They needed a little diversion. And found it in the cellar with a fresh must they put on the beer and the way they enjoyed it. Brother Nicolas (or 'Nico' to his close friend) brought some hand rolled cigars. O'Sullivan, the outspoken one, broke the vow of silence by spinning a remix of some Gregorian chants. Together, they'd throw down a couple nice hands of Texas Hold 'Em and savor the handcrafted brew they'd created in secret. Everything was good. Or so it seemed. But deep in his heart, Nico knew they were delving into the 'dark side' of beer. Next thing you knew, they'd be skipping Lent. Then one night, they'd face the Judgement for their actions with a hard knock on the door. Outside, the Abbot and elders would be holding stones in the air. A threat the brothers were sure would lead to the spilling of Monk's Blood. Belgian-style Dark Ale brewed with cinnamon, vanilla, oak chips, and dried figs."" Whew!"
"I was a bit shocked by this one (and not just because it's a Belgian Ale in a can!). The flavors here were a bit muddled at first but then overall really came together nicely for me in one potent and flavorful mix. Just the right amount of ABV here to, helping make this a pleasant and warming sipper on a cold night. I'm looking forward to more of these during the course of the winter."
"Nice drinkability. Well hidden alcohol. Very unique belgian and coming out of a can adds to the uniqueness. A good beer that I would drink again."
"be sure to give this a try if you see it. yet another solid beer by 21st amendment."
"D - Can says 8.5% alcohol, but doesn't taste or feel that high...probably makes this one pretty dangerous. Lots of fruity flavors and very smooth. Overall pretty drinkable Belgian dark ale. Usually these are one in a session sipping type beers, but I wouldn't mind cracking another of these right now."
"All in all, this is a decent brew. Middle of the road ABV that is masked well with a watery flavor. Easy to drink, but because it is watered down. Might be a good brew to start with when converting from mainstream brews. Decent, but not great."
"Overall- Fruity, chocolately,and sweet. Ehhhh."
"All in all a disappointment. I'm not sure what the brewer was going for, but this is just a sweet mess without many endearing qualities to it. After trying the 21st IPA with similar results, I'm going to take a pass on further brews from the brewery."
"new apartment, no internet, cellular review"
"This is a drinkable beer. I am on my second can, but two will be enough. The flavors are good but the beer lacks complexity. Time to move on."
"Yes, its just another American attempt at Belgian beer. Just dont think of it that way. It's a sweet, dark red thing, high in booze and ready to dance on your palette. Be happy, pour it in a goblet and laugh at the audacity of those silly Americans putting Belgium in a can."
"On tap at Moe's in Lee, MA. Pours a dark brown, almost black, with a small white head that disappears almost immediately. Smell is decent, dark fruits. Taste is interesting, grapes, sour apple, rum, raisins. Quite the strange tasting brew, couldn't really decide whether I enjoyed it or not. Alcohol definitely shows through towards the end, carbonation was low but overall mouthfeel felt a bit flat. It's interesting, I'll give it that, but I probably wouldn't get this again."
"On-tap at the Church Key after being disappointed by another US Belgian, Allagash Four. This one held up a lot better in my opinion, although I'm not sure how Belgian-y it was - seemed a lot more like a US stout with a little extra sugar, but that's just me. It was mostly what you'd expect - dark brew with a solid head, then lots of chocolate, dried fruit, and molasses. Solid, if perhaps unexceptional (not a Gouden Carolus by any means). Would probably get it again, though, given the remarkably cheap price tag."
"Not really excited by this. Don't find it very drinkable at all. I have one can left and I will cellar that for at least a year.. (just because it can't get much worse)"
"On-tap at Stub & Herb's for $5 a goblet. Eh, this came off like another American attempt on a Belgian beer that doesn't quite make it. The aroma has a pleasant toast crust and cocoa character that reminds me of Belgian stouts. The flavor then splits into chocolate roast and cherry juice. Those would be ok, but they're accompanied by an acetone note that throws this whole beer off."
"I'm kind of torn on this one. It's interesting and shows a lot of complexity but it's not really to my personal taste. I like more of a traditional malty dubbel or a really funky belgian. This is kind of in between."
"Overall a tasty ale. The sourness was a bit off putting however."
"D - one definitely wasn't enough. not even sure a four pack will be enough. I could drink this all night."
"Overall, a boring beer to be honest. It isn't great, it isn't terrible, just messy and kind of blah. Give it a try. Cool to see a belgian style in a can at least, hopefully someone out will can a nice belgian IPA soon! Ok beer, try it when you get the time/boredom."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1/4"" tan head over the slightly cloudy burgundy brew. Head lasts alright, with good legs but quick-falling lace. Aroma is dark fruits, alcohol, and spices. Taste is malty to start, fruity and tart in the middle, and then warms up with alcohol and another shot of sweetness to close. Mouthfeel is smooth, and drinkability is good for the style. Better than I expected, not being the biggest spiced beer fan."
"M,D- Monk's blood has a medium body that is easy enough to drink and also does not show it's strength, the alcohol does not come into play. A off taste does but that's about it, this is a good attempt. While the carb is nice, I usually find more in many other's of the same style, blood may have used more. The drinkability is easy, I actually took my time with it to see where it was going. This just got better with time. Will be getting more and i may cellar a can or two."
"Slightly chewy body that's on the fuller end. Roasted chocolate/caramel maltiness balanced by lots of estery sweet dark fruit notes, candy sugar and subtle earthy oak. Very vinous from the barrel aging with lots of smooth vanilla character. Very sweet dark fruit presence, especially sour tart cherry, plum, raisin, fig and raisin. A bit too sweet for my liking but overall decently balanced. The ABV is very well masked making this beer very quaffable. Complex, flavorful and very unique. I'll definitely be drinking this again"
"Overall, this beer was unimpressive. Nothing I want to have again. I don't think they should have let cold spring brew this beer, as I think it could have turned out so much better."
"Overall a pretty neat canned offering. The convenience of having a flavorful beer in a can earns it some more points. This is one that really needs to warm up."
"Next review!"
"Monk's Blood is dark in name and color but light in taste and feel. It doesn't seem quite heavy enough for the style, but it's delicious, warming, and so easy the alcohol sneaks up on you. It would be perfect, and dangerous, at a holiday party."
"Taste follows the nose. Very enjoyable. Sticky sweet. Now available in your favorite grocery store. Mama Lucia, America's favorite meatballs."
"Interesting fruity twist on a BSDA but a bit too sweet. In my opinion, this beer could have come out a bit better with some souring and a bit of time in an oak barrel. The beer pours red-tinged brown with a dissipating, off-white head. The aroma is vanilla, cherries, caramel, cognac and some sweet fruitiness, which may be from the figs but it's more sweet than figgy. The flavor is just a bit too sweet, throwing the whole package off a bit for my tastes. I'm not saying it's terrible, but I think the beer could have really benefited from more attenuation. This is probably one of the best beers that I've had out of a can."
"D: quite drinkable now if you dont mid i will now have another"
"This beer set me up for high hopes in a lot of ways. The flavors kind of let me down though. Beer has a medium body and there is a slight boozy character to it. There is no hint of roast or of hop based bitterness leaving the back of the palate blank when confronted with the sweetness from the alcohol and malt up front. Beer seems to be disconnected. There is no aftertaste and overall I'd say its worth a look, but I won't be very quick to finish my 4 pack."
"I have to say that this beer has a lot going for it, great packaging, great name, and a cool concept. The can pours a dark reddish brown beer, with about two fingers of white heading. Sort of looks like blood too. Has a red wine like nose, and something slightly sour, or vinegar like. Also I get some touches of herbs or spices. Taste is grainy, slightly sour in the middle, and ends on a note that makes it almost resemble a Flanders Red. Mouthfeel is a bit on the thin side. This one does not feel like it has a weight of 8.50. Drinkability is not too shabby, I suppose I was just expecting a beer that was closer to a Dubbel than a Belgian Strong Dark. The third release from these guys in cans is not a bad beer by any means. Hopefully they will continue to can new beers, and send them out here. Cheers"
"D: Very drinkable"
"All in all, Monk's Blood is complex, flavorful, and delicious. Thumbs up! ~"
"Pouring this beer and the head rises to two fingers high. It's a brownish color that is pretty bubbly. The color of the beer is a blood red or a burnt red color. It's very clear you can see right through it pretty easily. The aroma is a malty candy smell and it's pretty big. I can smell it a couple of feet away from my beer. I also pick up some alcohol raisin notes. My initial taste I get a fig, plum character also I picked up on a nut like flavor as well. Subsequent tastings a yeasty or a doughy feel mixed in with a brown sugar like quality is also present as well as a mild floral hoppy note but it is really in the back ground. The finish is a slight cloying taste with a mild bitterness or alcohol bite. Overall, I really find myself enjoying this beer a lot. It is a sipping beer that goes well with a cold winter night."
"A nice beer from this brewery. Probably the best I've had from them."
"Overall, a nice shot at a Quad by 21 Amendment. It's definitely not bad, and I will have it again. Belgian Quad in a can? I'm all for it. This could still be worked on a tweeked just a bit."
"Gotta love living in a country where its brewers will brew quality Belgian style brew and put it in a can! This one pours a nice rudy shade of dark mahogony with some ruby glimmers, loose dark khaki head, clears out pretty rapidly, leaving a thin film, a collar and ample spots of fine lacing. The nose is loaded with darker ripe fruits, cherries and figs come to mind as well as raisins and light rum. Flavorful and quite tasty, with more dark fruit notes, raisins, figs, dark grapes, vanilla and perhaps a wiff of the advertized (on the can) cinnamon. Great winter brew, pleasant and easy drinking. On the sweat side buy nowhere near cloying. Nice beer to take winter camping, easy to pack in and worth the effort...Christmas dinner desert beer and/or as a quality night capper"
"Pours into a tulip, a dark, clear mahogany red color with high carbonation and an airy, thick beige head. Quickly fades to a crown and broken rings of clumpy lacing. Aroma is fairly strong and sweet, dark fruit, figs, yeast, lots of sugars. Mild tangy sourness to the nose but little presence of hops or whatever oak aging occurred. Flavor throughout is dominated by tangy and sweet notes, very little alcohol presence. Flavor starts on front of palate with sweet dark fruits, figs, candi sugar, raisins, etc before becoming drier and more tangy toward the finish with a light hop bite. I also pick up a little cinnamon in the finish, but little in the way of other spices. Mouthfeel is medium full, with low carbonation, probably more carbonation would help clean up the finish. Interesting beer, but overall this is a little too sweet for my tastes and the dry, slightly bitter finish clashes with the flavors in the body."
"Figs as an ingredient sounded a bit odd but worked nicely with this beer."
"Drinkability - 4.0 - good beer, would definitely get again."
