3.96,-2.9,4.25,3.75,4,4,4,"Reddish brown with a fine white head. The spice aroma comes in right away with a subtle sweetness that has a brown sugar tinge to it. A bit of estery yeast in the  nose, not much. Pretty mild hops, had hoped for a piney profile. Didn't get it. The flavor is spicy in the initial with some clove-cinnamon, followed by the dried fruit of what to me was fig, raisin, and date which lent a brown sugar-honey combo. Very nice. Finishes with  the sweet and yeast for the signature Belgian flavor. As expected, the dried fruit, sweet, and estery  components increase as the beer comes to temp.","MisterGone","Dec 26, 2014"

4.1,0.5,4,4,4,4,4.5,"750 ml bottle into signature chalice, bottled on 8/16/2012. Pours slightly cloudy ruby red color with a 1 finger fluffy light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty lacing clings on the glass, with some moderate streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of raisin, apple, caramel, molasses, nutmeg, cinnamon, toast, candi sugar, light clove, bread, and yeast earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of deep malt with yeast esters and spices. Taste of raisin, apple, caramel, molasses, nutmeg, cinnamon, toast, light clove, candi sugar, toffee, pepper, bread, and yeast earthiness. Lingering notes of light fruits, caramel, molasses, nutmeg, cinnamon, toast, candi sugar, light clove, toffee, bread, pepper, and earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice balance and complexity of malt flavors with fruity yeast esters and spicing; with a great malt/spiciness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a fairly slick and moderately prickly mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a small warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is an excellent spiced Belgian strong ale! Great balance and complexity of malt, yeast esters, and spices; and very smooth to sip on. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","May 16, 2013"

Smell is of malt, brown sugar, dark fruits, spices, and an earthly, honey-like aroma. Taste is much the same with a dried dark fruit flavor and a slight alcohol kick on the finish. There is a mild amount of spice bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel.

It pours a dark ruby-brown topped by a finger of khaki foam. The nose comprises dark fruits (focus on the fig, as per usual in this style), light red apple skin, cinnamon, brown sugar, clove, light cream, and a firm undercurrent of sweet caramel. The taste brings in more of the same, along with raisins, pumpernickel, and a light wisp of cocoa powder. The body is a lithe medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a generally smooth feel.

3.98,-2.5,4,3.5,4.5,3,4,"In my house, Belgium dominates the Christmas seasonals every year. The winter seasonals and winter warmers pouring out of American breweries are fine - even better than fine. But the rich and textured tradition of Belgian Christmas brewing really shines in the weeks leading up to the biggest Christo-secular commercial frenzy of the year. One of my seasonal regulars is Affligem’s Noel. It pours dark brown and red, dotted with bubbles, and crowned with a great blustering head. Warm scents of apples and pears invoke the sweeter side of winter cooking, the scents soft, mellow and a hint of grainy dryness. The taste is less meek. Beginning with the apple and pear flavors, it shifts to a richer and savory palate of flavors: cream, cedar and a cheesy umami. The savory cascade ends with a light aftertaste of wheat, completing the cycle of flavors and beckoning another sip. The Affligem Noel runs through old world flavors at a comfortable pace, and orchestrates disparate flavors into a single, delicious beer. The Noel is a welcome new tradition to my present and future Decembers.","GarrettB","Dec 27, 2011"

The smell is very subtle tropical fruits to strong dark fruits. No hops in the smell at all. In the taste, there is a ton of sweet malty fruits and it leaves a tropical fruit tang. Very nice and the spices are subtle but they are there. The mouthfeel is medium sticky and leaves a pleasant flavor. Overall, this is a top notch beer. As it warms, you get the flavor of the grains to balance the sweetness. An amazing beer indeed and perfect for the holidays. Not as spiced as I thought but I must say its not as warm as I would like and as it does I am sure it will have flavors jumping out of it.","Vancoubeer","Dec 24, 2011"

Mildly spiced and just slightly sweet tasting. Flavors of caramel, plums, figs, mildly spiced, and some vinous flavor. The substantial ABV is not detected. Medium bodied and has a nice texture. Not quited silky smooth but it is getting there. Affligem did not go overboard with adding spices to their Chrismas Ale so it is not much different from standard strong dark ales.

Retention was decent but could have been a tad more lasting. Aroma was excellent -- a nutty fruit, with caramel, molasses, and a tad of spice. Taste matched the nose and was superb -- rich and well balanced. Some mild apple hints but not the cheap overpowering effect that you find in some of the less refined Belgians. Mouthfeel was light and a tad on the watery side, but not in a bad way, making for a very drinkable ale that could leave you blitzed in a hurry if your not careful.

The head was big and frothy, tan colored, and left no lace that I could see on the glasses. The smell was similar to several other Belgian strong ales I've had, it brings to mind Grotten Brown and maybe Nostradamus. The main aromas were dark fruits and yeasty esters.

I'm pretty unimpressed with the flavor here. Just has a vague (and overbearing) malt sweetness with some spicy, phenolic yeast tones and warming alcohol. Although, I don't like it when beers are spiced over the edge, they would have been more than welcome in this modest beer. Admittedly, there is a pleasant dried fruit thing going on in the middle and a really nice grassy and floral hop character in the finish. Finishes sweet. Mouthfeel is moderate with a great carbonation. Very bubbly, but the bubbles only make this feel fuller in the mouth rather than pricking the tongue.

There are notes of carob and chocolate followed by the dark fruit aromas; dark cherry & prunes. There is some subtle spice flavor.

I can smell some spices. reminds me of some kind of spiced papaya or mandarin orange salad, that is what i would drink this with. The taste follows the nose, and the abv is almost indetectable. A little overcarbonated for a dark strong but by no means abrasive, good kick in the tongue. aftertaste lingers for weeks, and spices stick to the side of your mouth as the fructose taste syrups to your lips. It smells and tastes like some kind of body lotion or scented soap. I'm pretty sure if they churned this with butter, girls would rub it all over them. Maybe im just saying that cause im tipsy and alone, im gonna go to another site, ill be back in a few minutes.

The aroma is quite spicy with coriander and cinnamon, and joined by some mild molasses notes. Rich and sweet on the palate, with plenty of spicing present from the start to the finish. Light fruitiness crops up at the mid-palate, but the emphasis is more on spices and sweet malts than fruit esters. Rich yeastiness comes out at higher temperatures. Mouthfeel is big in body and carbonation, although the carbonation is less than some other beers in this one's class. There's some residual stickiness in the back of the throat left by the caramel coloring. Overall, this is a good winter beer, and one that will probably age well, but I still don't get the caramel coloring thing -- it seems unnecessary and creates problems with mouthfeel.","geexploitation","Apr 26, 2007"

The head is about a finger or so and the lacing is incredible. The smell is spicy and fruity - reminiscent of Christmas cookies, which means there's some bread/yeast in the nose as well. Taste is tart cherry in the front with a spicy malt middle and a bit of floral finish - very complex & delicious.

Hazy brown with nice carbonation and proteins. Rests on natural spices already exhibited by Belgians. The added spices add not only spice flavor, but roundness, meldedness, and aged flavors without the sharpness usually shown in seasonals. Obvious spices added, but difficult to pinpoint the cinnemon, nutmeg, allspice, or any others. They come together well to contribute to the beer, not over power it.","BEERchitect","Feb 07, 2006"

Upfront in aroma is an egalitarian mélange of fresh grated cinnamon, orange peel and floral, nectar like esters. As it warms trace bubblegum and clove add subtle candylike and herbal tones, respectively. Judiciously spiced and welcoming aromawise. In flavor, incipient is a transient, citric, lemon like acidity. It is ensued by a dubbelesque combination of raisin, carob and yeast derived must. Spicing is agreeably understated and complementary. Mellow ground coriander melds with the sweet, woody undertone to lend a sandalwood smoke impression. The taste reminds me of the aroma of the markets in Riyadh I used to go to as a kid. Lightly bodied and surprisingly rather dry, but superbly quaffable as a result. Becomes more honey like in its malt character, while carob and dark fruit notes diminish as it breathes. Residual sweetness never becomes cloying. Finishes soft, with trace dark malt and hop bitterness lingering parallel with dilute orange sweetness. A delicious, complex brew that sits dangerously light on the palate. Akin to a traditional dubbel / spiced dark strong hybrid. Outstanding. I should've cellared this for longer.

4.41,8.1,5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"750 ml bottle, corked and caged. Aged for a year and a half (dated on the cork 6/02). A huge head of creamy light-tan foam resides over a dark chestnut body that teems with streaming effervescent carbonation. When held to the light, the clear brownish body displays ruby and brass highlights. The head retention is excellent, and it leaves wide creamy rings and craggy splashes of lace throughout the entire glass. And although the nose remains quite contained beneath its creamy cap, a distinct candy-ish character, some mustiness, dark fruit, and a touch of toffee come through. In the mouth, its very fine and natural (bottle-conditioned) carbonation warms to become quite airy, giving its light-medium body a bit of a bigger feel, and it passes across the palate with a quick zest that becomes pillowy soft & smooth before it reaches the throat. The flavors reflect the aroma with a candyish malt that's tempered by some sublime phenols and peppery spice. A touch of herbal hops and some minimal drying alcohol rounds it out. Along the way some subdued dark fruit, some nuttiness, and even a hint of cocoa appear; yet it finishes dry and powdery. Impressive! It's bold without being overwhelming, and it never builds on the palate. The alcohol is well-heeled and it finishes clean. This is a really nice beer to enjoy at a quite time during the holiday season, but I don't think it's subtle complexities can really be enjoyed within a party atmosphere.","NeroFiddled","Dec 23, 2003"

It's not tremendously complicated, but it's constructed so well - out of just a few perfectly-tooled elements - that it brings to mind a masterfully carved piece of woodwork.

Nice thick head and left nice trails down the glass. Had an almost peppery finish to it on the back of the palate. Great beer at a reasonable price.","LarryV","Apr 10, 2002"

It was simple exceptional.  Merry Christmas.","pbrian","Dec 18, 2001"
