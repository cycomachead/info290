4.98,23.6,5,5,5,4.75,5,"Poured a deep murky red with lots of foam to spare. Smelled like rotten apples, dates, figs, and sour grapes with an uncannily deep funk perfect for the cold weather. Tasted just as funky as it smelled with the Brettanomyces (I guess) and the oak barrel aging working its magic with the nutty malts to to create a magical flavor. Mouthfeel was just as strange and as wonderful as the beer's other characteristics -- heavy and boozy for a sour or wild ale, light and carbonated for a Belgian strong ale. Overall I love this beer with its perfect and wildly unexpected marriage of dark fruit and roasted malt with crazy yeasty funkiness.","pigpen892","Feb 05, 2015"

I was expecting something different but this smells excellent. The flavor is chocolate covered cherries, light spices, a hint of balsamic vinegar, dry oaky finish.

4.24,5.2,4,4.25,4.25,4.25,4.25,"Overall I thought this was a very nice beer and I thought it was a pretty good example of a sour, BA has it listed as a Belgian Dark Strong Ale, but other then the light toasted malt aspect I don't find this beer to match up with the style, but I think it fits pretty well as a Sour or American Wild Ale. This beer had good drinkability, it was smooth, pretty crisp, a little prickly, a little refreshing, not too acidic, not too filing and the taste did a nice job at holding my attention, Drinking a whole bottle might be a little too much for me, but I think splitting it with someone is perfect. The flavor doesn't really come off as too winter seasonal like and I think this beer would be nice to have in the summer. What I like the most about this beer was the balance, nothing was too overpowering and the flavors seemed to work pretty well together. There wasn't anything that I disliked about this beer, I thought it was great just the way it is and I can't think of anything to improve it. I would buy this beer again and I wouldn't mind keeping a couple bottles around in the cellar. I would recommend this to anybody who like sours or American Wild Ales. All in all I was a little impressed with this beer and I'm glad I decided to revisit it, I don't know why I don't remember much about it from the first time I had it, I find it to be a pretty memorable beer now. This isn't my favorite Jolly Pumpkin beer, but it's up there as one of the better ones I've had from them and i would say it's above average as far as Wild Ales go. Great job guys, this was a really nice beer, keep up the great work.","StoutHunter","Mar 29, 2014"

Pours slightly hazy deep ruby red color with a 2 finger dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with some light streaming carbonation. Aromas of strawberry, cherry, green apple, raisin, orange zest, caramel, toast, oak, clove, nutmeg, pepper, hay, grass, herbal, light funk, and yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of fruity/spicy yeast, oak, and spice notes; with good strength. Taste of strawberry, tart cherry, green apple, orange zest, raisin, caramel, toast, nutmeg, clove, oak, pepper, hay, grass, light funk, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Light fruity tartness/spiciness on the finish; with lingering notes of strawberry, cherry, green apple, orange zest, raisin, caramel, toast, nutmeg, clove, pepper, hay, grass, herbal, light funk, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and complexity of fruity/spicy yeast, oak, and spice flavors; with a nice balance of fruit/spiciness and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, crisp, and lightly prickly mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice Belgian dark ale. All around nice balance and complexity of yeast, oak, and spice flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the ABV.

3.8,-5.7,4,4,3.75,3.5,3.75,"on tap at hops and pie, and absolutely world class establishment. a semi sour holiday brown here, not quite in the oud bruin tradition, but certainly on that block. hazy brick red to brown in color, lasting white head half in inch high. smells like lactic acid, lemon zest, chocolate malt, and something asian. its a very strange combination, but its cohesive and it works. there is a little more grounding in the taste, with the brown ale type malt bill and the souring fermentation goodies taking center stage, but it does have some dried cherry sweetness in the finish, as well as a subtle spice that may well be from the yeast or some rye malt. lots going on here, and it all fits together rather well. i like jolly pumpkins holiday or seasonal beers, they are all so well thought out and unique. there really isnt much like this on the market. tart and sour in the finish, but drinkable still at 9% abv. the feel is a little off for me though, it sort of curdles in the stomach, and as such is a slow sipper. maybe its the acid, maybe its the sugar, but its a little harsh once its down. medium body, maybe more, and excellent carbonation, it still feels slightly heavy. jolly pumpkin can do no wrong for me though, and this is even more far out than the bam stuff, its really different and well done.","StonedTrippin","Dec 28, 2013"

Smell: plum, dates, baking spices, brown bread, acetic, vinous and oaky. Taste: red grapes, plum, brown sugar, clove, cinnamon, grape skin, vanilla note, cranberry-like acidity.

I took a mental picture of the bottle and remembered the name, ""Noel de Calabaza"". A Christmas specialty ale by Jolly Pumpkin, I could not pass this up when I saw it at my favorite bottle shop near work, Jane's Beer Store. It was kinda pricey so I held off until just one bottle remained, now I'm having it after three months after buying. I could not justify trying this jewel until a special occasion. Thankfully this week was good enough and god-damn am I glad I finally found the excuse to try this.... I've always been a fan of Jolly Pumpkin and had great expectations for this brew but never would I have imagined this being one of my favorite beers. Really, it is that good. I will never walk by this beer and not pick one up. All I have to say is I can;t believe I had this thing stored for so long, ignorance is a bliss until you realize what you've been missing.

Some yeasty esters midpalate, tart granny smith apple and caramel malt join in; Finishes with pleasant oakiness, and just the right of vinegary tartness to lightly pucker the mouth. Heavy medium to light full smooth, silky body. Light, but fizzy carbonation. This is one complex brew that has a lot going on, yet all the parts collaborate and come together as a cohesive whole.

4.25,5.5,4,4,4.5,4.5,4,"Poured from the bottle into a tulip glass, the appearance was a reddish brown color. It exhibited a modest level of carbonation and a slight white head. A grape-like aroma was obvious, though it was the more tart elements of the grape as opposed to grape candy. In the initial taste, one gets a generous taste of sour grape, woodiness, and a mild hoppy bite. A modest level of carbonation exists, sweeping the taste toward the aftertaste. As drinkers progress toward the aftertaste, the alcohol is more noticeable, yet it lacks any significant burn. In the aftertaste, one gets the tart taste of grape skin with a little bit of spice. I am not certain what makes this a holiday beer, but I enjoyed it a great deal.","JohnnyHopps","0"

Texture is creamy and filling. Finishes with a bitter/tart after taste. Not noticing too much of the oaky taste but Iâ€™m sure the aging in oak did this beer wonders.

Aroma has tart apples dark brown sugars flowing thick and living thick, hints of oak and spices run through this wild open air fermentation ale. Flavor is nice a thick layer of spices and tart apple make for a fall festive ale/slash ready for snow type of beer warming with alcohol and complexity wrapped into one ale. A bit of horse blanket hints of leather grand complexity that only this beer has to offer, there's no other ale I can think of tasting to compare to this one. Super juicy with fruit and alcohol, spice with hints of dark fruit and layers of smooth alcohol.

I love the brett but as many have said in regards to JP, they could probably step it back just a botch to allow the beer itself to shine. It was hard to find any ""holiday"" nuances due to the brettiness and extreme carbonation. If the Batch 1, 2009 is in reference to month and year which is most likely, I may have to seek out a fresher bottle to see how it tastes. Flavors all much more pronounced once the beer reaches room temperature. Overall I certainly recommend this beer to the sour lover, but don't go buying any cases of it.","micstache","Jul 17, 2011"

There seems to be a slight disconnect between the smell and the appearance--they just don't match.

Bitter and tart, a very complex array of flavors. Apple cider, some oakiness, just a very well balanced and complex beer, nothing really sticks out. For a beer this big, the body is a little thin but considering how long I've held onto this one it's not all that surprising.

Flavor has an initial burst of tartness, pretty much typical JP oak and dryness, then of course nice layers of fruit underneath. Coconut and almond shine through very pleasantly. A slight vinegar-infused apple is present. There's more tropical fruits I can't quite put down. Kind of spicy in the finish.

But to those that read this who are writing it off immediately because of that don't worry, subtle notes of chocolate, dried dark fruit and cranberry come into play once the first sip goes down. This beer has a very generous head thanks to re-fermentation, that lingered around to the very last sip. Its overall flavor is reminiscent of sour apples soak in a Belgian strong dark ale, a truly joyous winter treat that I will highly recommend to others.","at1234","0"

Smooth and spicy and definitely a beer to let warm as it perks up a little as you sip on it; the sweetness is like caramel and sweet fruit and is up front and then comes a sour, sharp burst for balance like citric (orange) and spice for a nice finish. A good winter warmer.","clayrock81","Dec 20, 2009"
3.82,-5.2,3.5,4,4,3.5,3.5,"Jolly Pumpkin Noel de Calabaza pours a couple of stiff fingers of foam over an opaque cola-colored brew. Carbonation on mine (an '07) is very spritzy- in fact it gushed a bit when I got the cap off. The nose is typical Jolly Pumpkin tart funk, but also dark sweet fruit. Flavor is fruity up front- apple cider and dark figs predominate- maybe a bit of clove and wood, with a little tartness off the back, and herbal hops. Mouthfeel is round, but lighter than one would think because of the carbonation, and finishes dry-ish- there's a little oak in the aftertaste too. This is a 9% ABV ale, though that only makes itself felt with some heat in the belly- ideally, you're drinking this one slowly with friends- and you should.

A strong caramel/chocolate combo up front with an equally strong fruity sweetness that borders on syrupy.

The label professes the presence of ""layered hops"" but I am struggling to detect their influence on this brew. Upon close scrutiny, there is a slight hop flavor, but this is certainly dominated by the fruity sourness and spices mentioned earlier.

While drinking the first glass, I thought this was going to be a slog, as the sour and spices weren't quite doing it for me. Yet, sip by sip, this one wins your admiration. I think Jolly Pumpkin is the Radiohead of beer - seems complicated and obtuse at first, but as you give it a chance, it locks in.","Patrick999","Sep 19, 2008"

Aroma is tart and fruity. Taste starts with a peek of malt, then tartness takes over, with a wisp of alcohol at the end. Mouthfeel is a bit rocky being so tart, and drinkability cramped a bit as well. COuld maybe do with a touch more sweetness, and the style category here could be more towards a sour or lambic-influence. Interesting, nonetheless.","ppoitras","Aug 10, 2008"

The taste is very slightly sweet, very nice touch of sourness, malty, with some yeast notes, dark fruits, with a nice tone of oak/bourbon. Full-medium body, the alcohol is hidden very well.

There was a bite on the tongue, but nowhere as overpowering as some of the Pumpkin's offerings. The finish lingered with a great bite, but again, not so intense as to put off the uninitiated.

The christmas spicing comes through in the flavor. Tastes like a Flemish sour red ale with a dollop of orange peel, pepper, and anise layered on top. Alcohol not at all obvious apart from some spicy fruitiness. The body is airy and light, alive with a bit too much carbonation. A winner from Jolly Pumpkin. The bottle goes quickly due to the sour quenching character.","dgallina","Feb 09, 2008"

Earthy and fruity, notes of sour cherry and plum, light woody oak, with a hint of leather and tobacco in the finish. Medium bodied with ample carbonation that didn't overwhelm. Nice texture with a bit of puckering tartness. Sugary, yet dried the palate in the finish. Light alcohol warmth. Great stuff from JP, just as I've come to expect.

Big Biscuity malt in the background, but it's nearly obscured by everything else going on. Plums and raisins are here as well, and some herbs. This beer just keeps developing as you keep drinking it, it's pretty amazing, tons of dimension and flavour. Carbonation isn't too obnoxious in the mouth. Dries the palate out almost completely with sourness, just makes you want to keep drinking.

Slightly warming finish with both the complex, sweetish, oaky malts and the acidic citrus funk lasting a good long while. Medium-full body with rollicking, bottle-conditioned carbonation.

ItÂ’s like having a Flanders or a lambic even. Just wild yeast. I love it. On top of that there are noticeable sugars, minor wood tones., and just a nice, gentle perfume tone. Flavor is great. Nice use of spices that bring just the right level of character, but donÂ’t overpower things at all. Minor wood tones. Seems like there is a bit of a noticed alcohol tone. Just enough to notice it. Still all good though. Feel has a nice level of carbonation to it and a good liquid feel as well. Overall the contents are a bit thick and it becomes a sipper fairly soon into the game.
