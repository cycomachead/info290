"06/27/13 On tap. Very smooth & on the sweet side. Could use a bit more balance but not bad. I'm stickin' to just one as at 9% this could get tricky"
""
"Disageeable taste and mouthfeel, hard to finish a small glass of it."

"The body's got a nice strength and fluff to it, keeping up a consistent crispness while managing a smoothness that rolls nicely on the tongue. Alcohol isn't too sharp, and surprisingly not considering its effect on the smell and taste."

"Overall, this was a 2013 that may have needed a little more time, though the feel was excellent. The subtle barrel complexities could have been more prominent with more age so I will cellar the other one."

"This seems to occupy a space for dark fruity Belgians somewhere in between dubbels and quads/BSDAs. It is fairly robust and complex. As with others in the newly revamped and barrel aged Uncharted Waters series this is an outstanding value. Under eight bucks for a barrel aged abbey ale. It may not be stellar or ground breaking but it's worth a try."

"O: A good beer, but not a great one. I can taste a bit of the brandy influence on the palate, but not enough to make this any more special than the Belgian strong dark ales I’ve had in the past. Underneath it all, though, there’s a well-crafted abbey ale, and that still shines through as an enjoyable flavor profile."

"Overall, this is not a great revelation, but a competent selection. I will not seek it out again, but if it finds me that would be ok too."

"Overall: This was definitely an interesting beer but quite enjoyable. It is nice to see Heavy Seas experimenting with several different styles and methods of aging. This is worth seeking out if you're into barrel aged beers or Belgian style trappist ales."
""

"O: Nicely done dubbel."
""
""

"O: Phenomenal take on a abbey style Belgian Brew. Great flavors and aroma."

"Overall a fantastic Abbey Ale with the fruit, malts and alcohol working very well together. YUM..."

"22 ounce bottle, no date on it but I'm pretty sure it's about a year or so old since I know I've had this bottle a while. Served in a tulip, the beer pours a ruby red/copper color with about a half inch light tan head and some sediment floaties noticeable. Head retention and lacing are both good. Aroma is sweet and malty, it smells like dark fruit (raisins, plums), caramel, bready malt, and some brown sugar. The brew tastes like dark fruit (mostly plums), bready malt, caramel, wood, and a slight bitter flavor that I can't identify. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit slick and has good carbonation. I think it's a good brew, I enjoyed it."

"The Holy Sheet reminds me of a blend of two of my favorite beers, the Chimay Grande Reserve and Delirium Nocturnum. Medium to full bodied, a bit on the boozy side, with just the right amount of malty sweetness. I'm a big fan of the Holy Sheet, I recommend it highly."
""
"Very interesting beer. Poured a muddy brown, with very thin head. Pretty unappealing from sight. Nice sweet overtones in the aroma that were very inviting. Really rich taste, complex and sweet with a lot of malt. Slight fruity hints in the back. Stays on the tongue longer than expected with some sweetness there as well. Very enjoyable."
""
"O: this beer has a lot going for it, good body, great appearance and a good scent. but unfortunately the most important part, the taste, is a let down. i expect more from a beer like this."

"Certainly a strong ale. Not overly complex but a nice beer."
"While this one's completely not to style, the slight tartness and oilyness in the feel works for it. A surprising and enjoyable representation of the BSDA."
"Pours a translucent, brownish, ruby-orange. A tan head soon becomes a heavy ring. Smell is peaty, and caramelized malt. Sweet. Taste is balanced well up front with some earthiness and slightly floral hops. More smoky, robust malt. A touch of sourness on the back. Feel is super creamy, but lively at the same time. Great feel. Finishes long and crisp."
"Overall fine, but unremarkable for a dubbel. Improves as it warms."
"A pleasing brew and really reliant on Special B malt, I would guess. That mild pungency that arises from the beligian yeast and the fruity malt really makes up for the forward booziness."
"The taste struck me. I was expecting something less rich and deep. The rich sweet malt is the first thing that reaches your tongue. After the malt passes rich hints of plum or similar fruit can be detected. This fruity flavor stays with you in the aftertaste with just a hint of bitterness to balance and offset what would otherwise be a cloying sweetness."
"Interesting brew. Might have to revisit this beer at a different time. Winter for example!"
"O: Disappointing, but not bad. I won't be having any more. I recommend Clipper City's Mutiny Fleet, but not this bottle. Still, I'm determined to enjoy finishing it now that I've opened it. It shouldn't be too much trouble."
"Just an one finger head, not a good start, but the color is nice, rating a 19 on the SRM beer color chart. Clear and lots of micro bubbles. Smell is that of caramel, pineapple, mango, raisins, butterscotch, and malt. The taste is rich and full, with flavors of raisians, mango, pineapple, caramel, toffee, coco, butterscotch, figs, molasses, lime, and malt. Mouthfeel is good with a full body and creaminess. Overall I like this beer, although a little syrupy and a little sweet. Would make a great desert beer, or a welcome to my place offering."
"pours a deep brown, almost hints of purple. lots of dark fruit - raisins, figs, some cloves... nice full body on this one. not sure how the bottle holds up, but the keg was excellent. glad i tried it early in the day!"
"O: amazing beer, but I like it fresh from the tap or bottle as a personal preference. The cask doesn't do a whole lot to help this beer."
"O - Notes say it was pretty good, but I didn't find it to be too memorable. A solid American example of a BSDA."
"This beer poured out as a dark reddish brown color. With a decent head on it. The smell was a little citric smelling. Some Belgian yeast aromas too. The the taste was a little strange to me, kinda got a little funky on me. The mouthfeel was ok, overall I would have to try this one again."
"A really terrible beer, aroma was good. But there is a an acrid, bitter component that is very unappealing. Couldn't finish this one and ended up drain pouring it."
"O: Nothing outstanding, but worth a try."
"O: This is better than the typical bastardized American attempt at a Dubbel. It fortunately avoids the artificial-tasting fruit flavors of some of the other American version of abbey ales."
"Easy drinking beer, and incredible from a cask. I look forward to trying it on regular tap or in a bottle."
"Poured a deep dark brown, big thick brown creamy head faded quickly leaving a thin 1/2 inch clingy lacey gooey head that stuck till the bottom of the glass. The smell was classic belgian, sweet, dark cherries, but hints of caramel, even maybe chocolate, very full and nice bouguet. Maybe even a sherry or bourbon smell as well. Taste was wonderful, dark fruity flavors right up front, apricots, bananas, cherry, a bit of a bready taste and a nice dry finish. The feel was so much lighter tehn I though basedd on appearence, and that is a good thing in this case. Not thick at all, very nice light and lively consistency, nice carboination, dances around in the mouth, beautiful."
"-Cheers"
"Overall: A superbly done Belgian beer. Fruity, flowery, and malty. It is also extraordinarily drinkable for a Belgian beer. The alcohol is effectively masked by the flavors and it has a lighter-than-average body. In a word, delicious..."
"O - The beer is mostly a moderate-to-middling offering, except for the terrible taste. Why bother?"
"Beer is thick and sweet up front, mildly dry on the finish, overall it is easy drinking, a little hot on the front but it fills out in the midpalate with some yeast character. Eh, I'd have it again I suppose."
"overall: A nice brew though nothing outstanding."
"O - Sweet like a Brown, warm like a scotch ale. Bold - yes, but not that interesting. Although mind you, I'm not throwing this one overboard."
"Overall ok but nothing special, a bit boozy, sweet malts and sugars, fruits, slightly tangy makes new think this is on the edge of going sour and is infected."
"O - really nice flavor and drinkability even at 9% ABV. I'd like to have this again."
"Holy Sheet is pretty nice looking plum/mahogany, with a couple fingers of off-white head. It's not as explosive and frothy as the best Belgian style brews, but it does leave gorgeous sheets of lacing all the way around the glass. Head retention is just short of spectacular though. The nose is absolutely great, sweet dark fruits (very heavy on plum), and some bubble gum, fruity yeast esters. There's also just a hint of brown sugar. There's a big falloff when I take my first sip though, as the combination of the strong malty flavors and sweet fruity esters, without any kind of phenols or hops to balance, give the beer a profound cloying sweetness. This may also be due in part to possibly the worst mouthfeel I've ever encountered on any kind of Belgian style beer. It's noticeably underattenuated, and at the same time the carbonation doesn't have nearly the gusto to cut through it. As a result, the first word that comes to mind is syrupy, and that's diametrically opposite to what I'm looking for. As a drinking experience Holy Sheet is average, but when you're brewing in even a loosely Belgian style you're asking to be compared to some of the finest crafted beers around, and Holy Sheet just isn't on the same level."
"Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. Another good beer from Heavy Seas."
"Very drinkable beer, almost wine-like in every characteristic."
"D: The more I try to carefully evaluate the beer, the more I'm not a big fan of the flavor components. On the surface though, this isn't a bad beer or hard to drink, except the high alcohol levels."
"A few friends have suggested trying Heavy Seas and these guys know their beer so I'll make sure try another one of their offerings, just not this one. This was not worthy of the Orval chalice I used."
"A very good interpretation of Belgian dark ale. I'm serving mine up with a pot of sausage jambalaya and french bread. I even added a touch to the pot. :D"
"D- simply put this was an okay abbey ale, I've had much better"
"Drinkability - I want to kick myself - clipper city recommends letting this one age for two years before enjoying, while I like it now, I would agree that the flavor probably needs the time to develop with cellar-aging. Still, I have to admit that I enjoyed this ale immensley, the aroma is one of the best I've had, and the taste is not that far behind. I plan to purchase another, store it and give another review sometime in 2012 or 2013."
"Notes: Overall I feel this one was a bit on the sweet side with a simple raw character."
"A: A flash of thick head that drops relatively quickly leaving a spotty layer over the surface of the beer, deep amber to light brown in color, minor activity is visible in the beer - 3.50, S: Tons of tart cherries and a good deal of spiciness, lots of phenols and the faintest hint of a high quality balsamic vinegar (that's good), thick sweetness that I associate with dried figs or prunes - 4.25, T: Very spicy and slightly peppery, alcohol plays a large part of the palate, dry body, candied sugars, brandied soaked dried cherries, hint of clove, a bit dry and chalky - 4.00, M: Medium bodied but with a touch of silkiness - 4.00, D: All around a good brew, quite drinkable - 3.50"
"I have not had this fresh and I can only imagine that the years have put on a bit of mellowing. Good brew overall. I did notice one off flavor on first sip though and it seemed to melt away as the beer warmed. That being vinegar, was odd."
"Drinkability- Not a summer beer, a little too heavy on the palate and eye for that. I don't like the fruit tastes involved, and the mix of fizz and burnt sweetness with the sour fruit taste leaves me sort of, well, like I just sucked on something sour. I don't think I would search this beer out again."
"D- pretty tasty. The blend of fruitiness and toasted sweet malt made it good. One to two is enough because of the alcohol"
"popped this cherry into several oddly shaped glasses shared amongst friends departing for the spring, summer, and maybe longer. there is longing in this glass, a deep red and foamy longing, the carbonated blood of brothers. oh and it smells like our blood too. candied raisin booze (why my blood is such a hit at the bank) and sultry notes of caramel. shoulda maybe sat on this one for a few months but i just got the shit! i gotta open a bottle of something. if i ever get another one, i'll treat her righter. til then, she's a hot lass full of potential...ready for babies. hot candy babies."
"D: A slow sipping boozy experience that trades of complexity and depth for a high dose of alcohol fusels makes this a bit of a disappointment. A marginable drinking experience , hindered by the high alcohol that feels like it drinks several points higher then its advertised 9.0%av. It took me awhile to drink this, and im no stranger to big alcohol beers, but maybe had something to do with the lack of enjoyment and unbalanced nature. Highly unlikely a re-visit and wouldn't go out of my way to recommend unless the person is interested in only tasting scotchy booze."
"Pours a nice clear dark mahogany with a fine-bubbled pale tan head. Aroma is strong and fruity with yeasty and malty undertones and a whisper of butterscotch. Flavor is fruity and a bit sweet with malty and woody undertones. Texture is rough, edgy and tingly, leaving a pleasing finish."
"Pours a light Plum color with a big puffy head that settles down into a nice 1 inch top. Good lacing thruout. Not much of an aroma, a little dark fruit smell. Taste echoes the dark fruit. A little spice and raisins, a little of the belgian funk. Still not a great flavor. Its an ok try at the style but lacks that deep candied fruit flavor you get in other Belgian darks. Its easy to drink and the booze is hidden well. So overall an ok brew."
"Grade- B (cold) / B+ (warm): When comparing it against other Belgian (style) Strong Ales I feel like this beer is a bit lacking in the flavor department, and it really has to be kicked in the ass to offer up a nice aroma. Holy Sheet is a very drinkable beer and something I would easily consider going back to if nothing better was offered at the time."
"Really good beer!! The appearance was inviting with lace that stuck to the glass the whole way down. The smell was a little lighter that expected but nice with a balance of malt and hops. The taste great very balanced brew with a nice little bite of hops. The mouthfeel is perfect it has a nice feel to it. The drinkability is also great the beer has no overpowering characters and it finishes really smooth!! To be so strong in abv.% it is a really easy drinking brew!"
"Holy Sheet is a very disappointing offering from Clipper City, a solid brewery that I feel has some excellent beers in the form of Loose Cannon and The Great Pumpkin. I finished the bottle, but I won't be having this again."
"The beer poured a rich Mahogany with a tan head. The aroma was of caramel malt and spices. The tastes was of caramel malt, vanilla, and spice. The feel was heavy and wet. A very pleasant beer, the spices and vanilla were a good compliment to the malt."
"Notes: Very good example of the style, a rival of classic Belgian beers."
"D - Not a bad Abbey...I thought with being on cask the appearance and mouthfeel would have been better...but the sweetness in the nose and taste helped this one...not my favorite from Heavy Seas"
"Taste initially of the dark fruits, then the alcohol kicks in the aftertaste. Medium heavy mouthfeel, an interesting Uber Abbey Ale, this is. I'm not digging the fruitiness of the ale, but certainly worth the taste."
"Pours a deep ruby brown, black highlights seeping in at certain angles, with a nice half-finger of bright head, though the lacing is somewhat weak. The nose is a melange of coffee, dark fruits, and booze. The taste highlights those fruits, mostly plum and fig, with the booziness lending a sort of oakey flavoring; lots o' complexity. The body is a heavy medium, and it doesn't coat the mouth too much, allowing this brew to be fairly drinkable, though the moderate alcohol may have something to say about that."
"Drinkability: A bit simplistically sweet, and a bit hot at times, leaving a beverage that doesn't quite mesh well for me. By no means is it an exemplary example of the style, but, well, that's usually my feelings towards any of the Clipper City brews. This one just lacks the grace and charm of those bold brews from Belgian, or the Belgian-styled beers that many American breweries are excelling at nowadays. If it does have one thing going for it, it's the price - you could do a lot worse monitarily when it comes to a bomber these days."
"Mouthfeel is medium to thick with moderate carbonation. I opened this one not expecting to like it as much as I did, but I ended up really enjoying it. It was a nice mix of Belgian flavors with an American twist. I liked how the Belgian yeast was a little more subtle in this one which gave the other flavors a chance to come through."
"D- Very drinkable for the ABV. Looks, smells and tastes nice. Satisfying. Not bad at all."
"12 ounce bottle, a gift from a non BA friend, Daver. ""For fresh taste purchase before"" date notched onto the bottom of the front label. At 9% do folks want this one to be ""fresh"" or would some age calm things down and allow some growth of complexity? Oh well, doubt I will ever find out..Pours murky dark and dull brown, quickly dissapearing minor head and no lace. The nose is of rum, sweet candied fruits and boozy. Notes of dark fruits, caramel, sweet darker malts, a hint of smoke and more boozyness. Cant say I'm in love with. Lacks the density of flavors and intrigue of better crafted examples. Got to give Heavy Seas credit for sticking their necks out on this one."
"D) Pretty good. It's fairly tasty and my first try from this brewery. This may not be my favorite style but it's enjoyable enough. At 9% ABV its a sipper."
"Drinkability: A great beer to keep you warm on a chilly day. I enjoy what was done with this beer but there seems to be a discrepancy in it's advertised style. I would not consider this a Belgian Strong Dark Ale; I would consider this more of an American interpretation of a Belgian Strong Dark Ale. Personally I would drink this beer all night, I enjoyed what Clipper City has done with this beer!"
"Feel and Drinkability: Its funny that the label gets it right ""full bodied and aromatic..."" yes its very aromatic, too bad that doesn't come out in the flavor of this brew though. Body is full and carbonation is a bit high for my liking, too prickly as well. It works, but I think it could be better. Overall not a bad beer, but I think it could use some work. Its just not as complex or deep as others that I've had. Also everything bout it tends to be short lived. Sure I'm enjoying it but not enough to buy it agian."
"Bottle. Pours brown with a small ring of white head. Aroma of sweet Belgian yeast, roasted nuts and malt, and a touch of booze. Flavor is quite sweet with some alcohol and dark fruits as well as roasted malt. Palate is a bit harsh, grainy, and boozy. Overall much too sweet for me."
"D - This wasn't the best Belgian style ale. It just wasn't balanced."
"D - a decent beer, but there are many others in this style that I would reach for before this one..."
"Poured a solid burgundy color with good carbonation and a big dirty white head. HeNose is malts, grain, some fruits. Taste was a little effervescent with fruits like raspberries, figs, prunes, raisins and caramel. Lots of spice and alcohol. Mouthfeel is hot and unpleasant as this beer is off balanced."
"Tiny sediment suspended in an amber-penny body. Small, persistent, light khaki head. Some lacing. Nose of toffee, rummy fruits, spicy chocolate (mole?), and bubblegum. Good, but kind of subdued overall. Taste starts with some graininess and slightly tart fruits. Toffee malt blends in. Yeasty bubblegum is there as well. Slightly boozy in a rummy fruit sort of way. Medium-full body. Not that bad, but a little rough around the edges."
"I'm going to have a difficult time finishing this."
"D- Nothing outstanding but at $1.95 for a single it was worth trying."
"D- I had this once from a friend a couple months back, and now again from a friend. Probably wouldn't buy this one on my own, but it's not the worst beer you could drink after a days work."
"D: Not terrible for an American brewery attempting the Belgian style but I doubt I'll ever try this again."
"A nicely-done, American take on a Belgian ale. I've had pretty good luck with Clipper City's Heavy Seas lineup and this one is another solid offering.  I'd say this was probably the best beer out of their sampler 12pk  One to give a shot if you cannot afford the more expensive Belgian varieties or if you don't want to have to buy a 750 and drink it all in one sitting."
"Drinks very smoothly. The malts really make the body drinkable."
"Drinkability - A little too sweet for extended drinking, but still reasonably drinkable."
"Feels very fizzy and bubbly. Has a bit of a burn on the way down. Sharp on the roof of the mouth. It's a hard drink. Heavy, alcohol-rich, pungent. Akin to a barleywine. Cherry and spicy Belgian yeasts. It burrrns!"
"D- Good drinkability, although the ABV may be a bit much for me to drink more than one. Good beer overall, however."
"Drinkability: Sippable, one is enough"
"Color - Deep amber, looks like the Phillies of the Schmidt Era. Poured with a thin head. Smells spicy, hints of cinnamon. Tasted sweet from the alcohol, malty, scotch. Not a true 'abbey' but delicious, definitely going back for more."
"I'm not normally in to Belgian Dark Strong Ales but I do like this one. After a while you really start to taste the alcohol."
"I would definitely pick up a 6 pick of this to sip on no matter what time of year."
"I could drink quite a few of these, my first went down rather quickly for 9 percent. be careful."
"Out of a 12 ounce bottle and into my Duvel tulip glass, Holy Sheet appears a slightly cloudy crimson chestnut color with about a finger of light ecru foam. Nose and flavor are of raisins, cherries, sweet caramel, brown sugar, yeast esters, figs, and a touch of chocolate. A tad better than medium bodied and amply carbonated. A nice Belgian dark - worth a try."
"Overall, I think this is one of the better American Belgian-style beers,especially considering the price."
"Particulate suspended in the deep reddish copper body, topped by a decent off-white head, but the alcohol keeps it from lasting too long. Sweet cherry smell is dominant. Abundant esters add some complexity. Alcohol is detectable. Taste is estery with a distinct cherry taste as well. Definitely tart, almost mouth-puckering at times with some sourness. Sweetness tries to balance the tartness, but fails. The almost mouth-puckering tartness can be a little much for my taste and a little thin, but good level of carbonation. Not bad, but I probably won't buy this again"
"Overall, this is a very good brew, just not so much when comparing it to the style that it represents."
"Not a bad attempt for Clipper City here, but much room for improvement, think I could have a couple of these, although the alcohol doesn't seem to have hit me from it's ABV. Someone wrote about how it's on better on cask, I'm gonna hafta keep my eye out for that."
"Notes: Poor effort. Needs more carbonation, more balance to the mouthfeel. Flavors are good, but palate balance is way off."
"Considering the ABV, this is pretty smooth sailing, pardon the pun. Nice taste, not too much of a boozy flavor and not too filling."
"Pours a nice clean/clear dark golden brown color, some carbonation, nice little fizzy off-white head, with some sticky lacing. The nose is malty, with some figs, raisins, and plums. The taste is sweet, malty, with some dark fruit notes. Medium body. Drinkable, not a bad brew, glad to have had a chance to try it."
"Feels very slick on the tongue, goes down easy though."
"I like this one so much, I'd session two or three (over the course of an evening), even though it is 9%!"
"Drinkability is above average. Holy Sheet is a way better attempt at a BSDA than Hang Ten is at a weizenbock (seriously disgusting shit). I doubt I'll buy it again, given that I can get a 4-pack of Trois Pistoles or Maudite for about $1.50 less, but it's a nice try on the part of Clipper City Brewing."
"D: One would have to tread lightly with this Belgian ale, it is strong and rather tasty. The alcohol is present, which deters the drinkability slightly, but it's just a nice, robust abbey ale. Love the parrot dressed as a monk on the label artwork."
"On cask this beer easily scores a whole letter grade higher."
"Out of a bottle this beer was a copper/garnet color with good clarity. The one finger head of beige foam quickly dissipated and left marginal lacing. The aroma was strange, like roasted carrots. Toasted malt, Belgian yeast, hints of smoke and earth. The flavors were complex but not nearly as sophisticated as a true Belgian. Caramel malt, toffee, nuts, lots of earth, hints of wood, alcohol and an awkward bitterness on the finish. The mouthfeel was good, the body medium and the carbonation ok. I was not impressed, but it wasn't bad."
"D- Boozy and not all that appealing. The sweetness helps a bit. Not good, but stuff like this has come to be expected from this brewery."
"-Baron"
"I have to say that is probably one of the best American BSDA's that I have tasted."
"Drinkability gets lower marks. I was hard pressed to finish this before it got too warm. It was like downing shots of whiskey mixed with Sam Adams Boston Lager."
"Overall this is a decent strong dark ale. I wouldn't call it an extreme example of the style, though."
"I went to the local store (Julio's Westborough MA) looking for New Belgium Abbey Ale (didn't have it) and I picked this up. I was not disappointed. It had a roasted brown colour and a light head that disappeared quickly. Strong alcohol smell; malty with date and figs; a little sweet. Weakly carbonated and a little syrupy but overall very good and easily drinkable. In direct comparison to others of this ilk (Dogfish head Raison, Deliriums) I think this is a clear winner."
"-RR"
"Very little head, if any, same for the lacing. Red, brown mahogany in color, dark yet equally clear and clean, shade more orange at the rims. The nose comes up with milk chocolate, date and raisin fruit, the alcohol is noticeable, malts not able to smooth out the general volatility, light aspect of candied orange peels, has adequate density but lacks expressivity. Full-bodied, the carbonation does not add much texture nor get the flavors percolating. Hence, it's a bit sticky and more or less sits there as it produces rum raisin cake, date, fig and green apple fruit in addition to mild clove, cinnamon spice. The orange, lemon citrus mutters, touch more clarity to the biscuit and scone elements. Lack of concentration leads to an emptying out feel through the finish. If there's any flaws, would be the noticeability of the alcohol. Otherwise, just a beer that's consumable but misses the general mark."
"D~ This was a good beer from a brewer I've really wanted to like, and haven't been able to until this point. Nice change of pace from my normal IPA,Porter, and lager and was impressed. Drank at 40 degrees and I'd call it a winter warmer. Nice brew"
"medium bodied almost sticky mouthfeel, i could easily drink the six pack, but prolly wouldnt buy this again, goes to show you that belgians make the best belgian beer."
"Overall, avoid."
"This was a decent attempt overall. Like I said, not offensive in any way but not the best I've had by a longshot."
"Pours a three finger cream head that fades slowly, leaving some lace. Clear amber color. Medium carbonation and medium bodied. Raisin nose. Flavor is sweet, raisiny, not cloying good balance, higher ABV is hidden. $2.25 for a 12oz bottle from Colonial Spirits Acton, Ma."
"Wow. This is a beautiful fucking beer. I have had 4 of these tonight and am pretty tipsy. And $9 for a 6 pack of these is an amazing price. This might be the greatest tasting beer I've had thus far. I get an aftertaste of peanuts. Very good tasting brew. Try this beer at room temp at first. My first bottle was at room temp because I didn't feel like waiting on it to chill, and it was better than the colder beers I had later. Try this beer as room temp, it is so delicious. This is definitely my favorite beer I've had to this day. Fucking amazing. I'm sad I bought the last 6 pack of this."
"This is a decent beer considering my lack of alternatives in the area, but I probably wouldn't buy it again unless I was really jonesin' for a dubbel and had no other alternatives."
"Extremely pleased with this one. Had it on tap a few weeks prior and it was outstanding. Better on tap, but very good in bottle."
"Pours a clear copper/brown color. 1/4 inch head of a pale tan color. Good retention and decent lacing. Smells of alcohol, sweet malt, tart malt, and slight fruit aroma. Fits the style of a Belgian Strong Dark Ale. Mouth feel is smooth and crisp with an average carbonation level. Tastes of tart malt, sweet malt, and slight fruit/raisin. Alcohol content is noticeable throughout, but not in an overpowering fashion. Good blend with the tart malt not resulting in too much dryness. Overall, a pretty decent beer that's worth a try."
"Hazy amber with suspended yeasties. Little head to speak of but carbonation level is fine. Smells of rum soaked dark fruits, very fruity, spicy and sweet smelling. Taste is sweet as well with a caramelly-like flavor as well as the aformentioned rum raisins. Mouthfeel is sticky. Drinkability is good although the flavors did not improve with warming. Alcohol became much more prevalent in taste as this warmed up. Plus I was drunk."
"Dark amber colored ale with a very rapidly fading head.Aroma is fruity and malty.Taste is rum,dark fruit and alcohol.This beer kind of reminds me of a kool-aid mixed with rum.Tasty and drinkable although alcohol is very noticeable.I do recommend and would purchase agsin!!"
"Pretty much an average Belgian dark and bit overdone on the sweet side. Definitely worth a try, though."
"Eric"
"I'd pair this with a dessert/something sweet, most ideally to round out the flavor. As far as basic food pairings, maybe some salmon, salad or sushi (alliteration, yikes). As a Baltimore transplant, Clipper City has grown on me. I had a fantastic Hop3 on cask the other afternoon at Max's which is worth revisiting. This is their one beer I've truly enjoyed both times I've tasted it (inconsistent flavors, but both were enjoyable)."
"This beer poured a very dark red amber color and formed a light tan foamy head that left latticed lace as it subsided. A medium amount of carbonation is present. An aroma of malt, dark fruit and spices. The flavor was of malt, cherries and chocolate and combination gives it a candy aspect. The body is medium light and the finish slightly astringent yet sweet. Almost a little too sweet to enjoy."
"Oh, yeah, I love the name, too."
"Not bad. Easy to drink, even if it isn't the best example for its' style. Worth a shot, especially if you like the style. This may influence you to look for other examples as well. It's still quite drinkable."
"M&D - the base sweetness lends the beer a silky smoothness, some carbonation makes it through the taste and gives the beer a liveliness on the tongue, a refreshing well done beer, the Heavy Series continues its quality"
"Pours a clear copper in color with absolutely no head. Whole lot of malt in the nose. Lots of malt in the taste with a very strong fruit presence as well. Plenty of dark, ripe and juicy plums. Some dark grapes and just a hint of currant. Not the best of the lot, but easily drinkable."
"can't wait to drink the rest of these"
"This beer pours a deep mahogony color with very little head to it, not much lacing to speak of just little wisps here and there. Nose is very fruity and sweet malts, some sugar and yeast also. Taste is of caramel malts, some brown sugar, fruity - perhaps cherries, alcohol is detectable. There is a bit of an alcohol burn, slightly syrupy at first, and finishes a little dry. Medium Body. Overall, not a bad beer, I may not pick this one up again but I wouldn't turn it away."
"~Jonathan Passow"
"Overall a sweet malt bomb with some interesting complexity of dark fruit and spices. Tasty in it's own way, but doesn't quite fit the BSDA style. Certainly drinkable."
"Well done Clipper City!"
"Notes from: 3/6/08"
"D: This is an interesting take on a Belgian style. I like most of Clipper City's stuff, and this is no different. At once undeniably Belgian in style and American in execution. Well done."
"All good. Get some!"
"D- I could barely stomach one of these let alone a couple"
"Overall a decent stab at a Belgian Dark, though it doesn't do much to stand apart from the others. A nice drinker nonetheless...I will try more offerings from this brewery."
"Pray for me."
"Pours a dark auburn with creamy head. Very nice, rich color. It has a nice amount of aroma though it took me a while to really pick out what I was noticing. Deffinite notes of cherry and wheat, a malty smell but not malty like say a double bock or such. The taste has some sweetness and some spice, it's like a mix of a tripel and a barleywine almost. The flavors are mild, though. Hints of cherry, raisin, fig, but all light with very little aftertaste which has hints of things I can't put my finger on. It has a moderate body and good amount of carbonation that slides on your tongue. It feels good in your mouth and the light aftertaste makes it more drinkable."
"D: A uniquely spicy, fruity abbey ale with nicely hidden alcohol kick."
"D - Interesting brew with interesting flavours. Not at all heavy despite being high alcohol."
"Tasted at the annual Cask Ale festival held by the Blue Point Brewing Company. Pours dark brown with a slight head, and bears a spicy, fruity aroma. The taste is fruity and hoppy, strong flavors of cherries and raisins. Not a great example of the style, more American than Belgian, but still a nice brew."
"Had a bottle that is seven months past its ""best by date"". Not nearly as sweet, and a little sour. Not great; it still doesn't really come together, but better than fresh."
"purchase by jul 08 (no yeast on bottom ?)pours a clear deep copper-brown color w/ a non-existent head which leaves little lacing in my snifter ; a cherry/raison smell w/ notes of nuts, wood and alcohol ; an overly sweet, rich, malty flavor starting out w/ tart cherry and dried figs w/ some oaky rum-like notes turning a bit rough w/ a strong hot alcohol flavor, some caramel and nuts come thru as it warms, some ""flowery"" undertone in the finish ; a robust, full mouthfeel with little co2, feels a bit ""slick"" on the tongue ; a drinkable beer, but not an exceptional one, could be aged for a while.."
"Rich and sticky with an oily-sweet lipsmacking finish. Coating, sticky, heavy."
"The weak point of this very nice beer is the appearance which leaves very little head and becomes just a mahogany, somewhat clear, slightly syrupy, flat looking beer. Keep going and it gets better. The aroma has hints of fig, maybe apricot, alcohol, and an overall rum soaked fruitiness. The taste is very chewy with some caramel maltiness, warming alcohol, heavy fruits, raisin, some grains, and an overall pungent strong Belgian dark character. There are some yeasty bits floating in the glass. The beer is medium to full bodied, and packs a bit of a wallop. This is a very nice Belgian style beer, but you'll have to get beyond the appearance which underestimates the true qualities of the beer. L'Chaim."
"Holy Sheet pours a dark amber with a foamy but fading off-white head. The aroma is at first fresh, overripe raspberries, with hints of caramel. The flavor is rich and malty, with some of the fruity berry flavor and a dark, toasted caramel finish. There is a bit of an alcohol bite at the end, not quite covered up by the huge flavor of this beer."
"I'd pair this with a dessert/something sweet, most ideally to round out the flavor. As far as basic food pairings, maybe some salmon, salad or sushi (alliteration, yikes). As a Baltimore transplant, Clipper City has grown on me. I had a fantastic Hop3 on cask the other afternoon at Max's which is worth revisiting. This is their one beer I've truly enjoyed both times I've tasted it (inconsistent flavors, but both were enjoyable)."
"D: The bitter after taste and alcohol warming make this one far from a session beer. However, it is slightly above normal for the style."
"Very dark amber with ruby highlights and a vigorous pour yielded only a slowly diminishing off white head. Big fruity aromas of raisons, ripe orchard fruits, and berries mixes with roasted malts, and some phenols. Nice mouthfeel, starts creamy and develops a nice weight leaving a slight slickness on the palate. The layers of fruit character is terrific; dried fruits, tart berries, tropicals at times. Some hop notes stand out in the finish along with some phenols and a vinous quality."
"Overall - A very wine-like ale. The flavors are plentiful and satisfying, although I do prefer the smell over the taste. Malty, fruit, hoppy, tangy, this beer has it all. A great nightcap. I wouldn't get this every week but it does have its prime moments for around $2-3 per 12 oz bottle."
"Flavor is similar but yeast and clove spice is stronger. It has nice notes of dark fruit, and light earthy qualities. The strong, hot alcohol flavor overrides everything after a few sips. It tastes very fresh and perhaps it needs a few months or years to tame. It tastes like it could become excellent with age but for now it's just too hot."
"The bar is set pretty for a beer like this, but Clipper City pulls through. Puts its own stamp on the style and doesn't just go for the clone approach. Yet another very likable beer from the Heavy Seas series."
"Not a bad brew to sip on - in fact the maltiness is nice. But, there are American interpretations that have greater depth and complexities, not to mention some of the great Belgian classics - which this hardly holds a candle to. Wish there was more ""going on"" here. Maybe it's the yeast strain. Overall, as I stated, it's not bad, but just doesn't thrill me."
"I'll be curious to try this one again after sampling more abbey ales but for now, I'll be leaving it alone."
"Overall it's a good beer that I'm glad I got to try but I won't be seeking this beer out anytime soon. It may be a good choice to interduce the style to someone though."
"Drinkability: A decent beer. More booze than flavor or aroma. Not a great one. Won't be seeking again."
"T: Medium body, adequate carbonation, pleasant mouth feel. For such a strong beer and flavors, finish is generally clean. Taste follows the smell, malty body, with dark and candied fruits, caramel and slight medicinal taste from the alcohol. I'm not crazy about this, and the alcohol is a little too strong and unbalanced, but for an American take on this style, it's pretty good."
"Poured a deep ruby/burgundy color with an off white head that hung around a couple minutes. The head left no lacing as it dissipated. Smelled really sweet. Alcohol was prominant but not overwhelming. It tastes great. Drank it along with a grilled ribeye and mushrooms. The sweetness settles down as it warms a bit. Good clean mouthfeel with no aftertaste. Very drinkable beer though you will want to space them out because they're not year-round."
"D,notes: My feeling is that this beer does not manage its alcohol content well. It's pretty hot. I did not find the other flavors particularly robust or good tasting."
"My review is the current report on this beer."
"M&D: Full and satisfying mouthfeel but not heavy. Carbonation is light and creamy making for one wicked smooth experience. Although there is some warmth in the finish, this still goes down way too easy and could sneak up on you in no time. Beautiful brew and highly recommended."
"Drinkability is pretty good, but I'd like to see how this improves with some time in the cellar."
"Wow fruity is one thing that came to mind with my first sip. Also the aroma was that of holiday spiced punch. The taste is that of dark cherries and black grapes with a bitter aftertaste after the bubbles die down. The appearance is a honey colored reddish/brown with a small white head that this appears leaving a lace trail very quickly. The warmth from the alcohol warms the tongue like hot coals warm a pot while sudz make the tongue tingle. This beer is noticeably heavy in its punch (almost made me shout ""Holy Sheet!"" and I don't think I could knock back more then one in a night."
"Sorry Hugh."
"D: One bottle is good. This one shoots for too complex of a flavor profile."
"Taste is impressive with this one. Lots of sweetness, juicy fruits and a nice bit of warming from the high alcohol. This is a rich and flavorful beer and a great American version of a strong Abbey ale. This is a very unique beer with quite a bit of complexity. Another great beer from the Heavy Seas collection!"
"Not a bad Belgian strong it's a bit warm they could have turned down the alcohol some"
"This poured a dark and clear reddish brown with white head. It had a very sweet but earth smell like wild wheat, caramel malt, and floral hops. It tasted almost like a dry chardonnay grapes mixed with sour cherries, along with floral hops and some yeast. It was watery with some carbonation and had a moderately bitter aftertaste. Overall this had nice flavor for an abbey ale: very clean and drinkable."
"I found this beer interesting at first, but it became somewhat one-dimensional near the close, with the alcoholic aftertaste beginning to overpower after a time. Nonetheless, it's worth it to give this one a try, because they did manage to nail the whole ""Belgian style"" pretty well. Maybe aging it might develop a few of the flavors further, as well."
"There may be enough Belgian 'stuff' in here to be considered an Abbey-style Ale, but the beer kinda falls apart without proving that it belongs up there with authentic Abbey Ales. the pour brings a beautiful chesnut colored, ruby hue with light, airy head formation and withstanding retention. Heavy carbonation brings a sparkling character to the beer. Aromas are sharply sweet with hints of caramelization, confectionate sugars, heavy esters, and an agressive ethanol scent. Flavors begin with a Dopplebock-like melanoiden caramel and worty-sweet character, along with confectionate sugars that don't attenuate fully. High esters of plumbs, grapes, and bruised fruits swirl around an agressive 'rum-meets-nail-polish-remover' alcohols, making the beer tough to drink. Finishes very alcoholic, hot, and sweet. Perhaps some age can help the brew, but the flavors have not melded, at least not as of yet."
"Not the best example of the style. The alcohol is running rampant in both the nose and the flavor."
"Love it when American brewers get Belgian right. Holy Sheet is one of those seasonals that has a bit of shelf life as well being 9.0% abv but it drinks very well when fresh."
"Put it in a corked and caged 750 and people will drool."
"A bit of a mess, and not recommended, but not awful."
"overall this does not work for me. reminds me of rotten caramel apples. something off-putting in the odor and the alcohol may be high for the style. also the sweetness and then the acrid finish..."
"A decent BDPA. Enjoyable, but nothing to get too excited over."
"Dark brown but very clear - no head. Smells like sugar/alcohol. Tastes like, well, brown sugar, I guess. And alcohol. I should give it higher marks, here, 'cause the wife likes it so much, but, well, I just can't. Sorry. It's really too bad, too, given how much I enjoy others of the heavy seas series. Hmm. Maybe I'll have to check my scores and rereview them or something. This one just doesn't do it for me."
"Pours a dark brown with ruby highlights when held to light. The beer is topped with a thin head that diminishes to a thin layer. Aroma is loads of dried fruits, brown sugar and yeast. The taste is an interesting blend of flavor, just nothing all that spectacular. The beer is medium bodied with plenty of warming alcohol. This is a decent beer, but nothing remarkable."
"A 12oz bottle, with purchase by Jul08 on the label. Served in a tulip glass, this was a dark red/brown (burgundy according to the label) with a small white head that didn't last. It had a pleasant spice and fruit aroma, and there was a nice yeasty edge to it also. The taste was sweet, plum and/or cherry, followed by some bitterness. Alcohol well hidden. Maybe a little too much on the sweet side for me, but still a very enjoyable beer."
"D - Drinkability is good. The beer is smooth and the alcohol is hardly noticeable. I would have no problem having a few more of these."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, good kick, decent representation of style, it's not a bad beer and I could drink a few, but it's not one that would select over too many others."
"D- The strong alcohol in this does not hurt the drinkability in the least. It goes down smooth and easy and leaves the pallet craving another sip even after the last drop is gone. I am very impressed... This brewery has made an excellent accomplishment here, successfully reproducing a half decent but lower priced American version of a style that is normally much more expensive and less accessable."
"Although it is medium bodied, it packs a wallop. Great sipper for a nightcap or a fireside chat. If I would accompany food, it would be with smoked salmon or hot pepper cheese. Smooth for its strength."
"M/D: Full bodied, carbonation is a little prickly, alcohol is there in taste a little and also a little warming. Drinkability is good. Would have liked some yeast in the bottle at least. Overall, a decent effort at the style."
"Otherwise, not a bad sample from Clipper City..."
"A clean dark amber beer. Has a small off white head. The aroma has a light floral character with small caramel malt note and a strong candy background.The candy sweetness hits the tip og your tongue first with that distinctive belgian hop note at the sides of your tongue. The finish starts with a strong malty sweetness rushing down the back of your tongue followed by a light peppery bite at the end."
"-Oelergud"
"Appears a brilliant clear ruby brown tone forms a thin tan head, carbonation sort of fizzy. Lacing forms thin and sparse with specks scattered sporadically around my pint glass. Aromatics offer tart raisin and apple notes with some candi sugar and caramelized brown sugar like malt tones, very fruity not much spice noted. Flavor comes off with a trace of metallic funk, super sweet border line syrupy sweet with candi sugar coming off in a bad way. Deep fruits of plum and raisin with evident alcohol notes drowning out most of the other flavors, spices are lacking seems like the yeast strain is in house. It sits really heavy with a rather cloying sweetness that takes over and doesn't let any other component truly shine. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with sticky residual sugars hanging around along with carbonation levels that I consider pretty rough especially for what should be a velvety smooth Abbey style ale. Drinkability not a bad 12 pack sampler brew but nothing to grab a whole six of, one and move on maybe this is your style."
"D - The other Clipper City brews that I've had were way better than this one this could have been a great beer if they could of had more flavor and less alcohol taste in it"
"Very nice, struck me as a BSDA, which, in fact, it was (I really impress myself sometimes..., yes, this is sarcasm). Not too sweet, nice complexity, only complaint is alcohol is a bit too evident."
"Pouts a clear and dark brown. Crème head. Nose is candy and slight sugar. Seems one-dimensional. Flavor is super sugar as well. A definite hijacking of the experience. Too much sugar, Slight caramel tone. Not much else going on. Feel is low in carbonation and sticky on the liquid feel. This is one to pass on. Sure there are promising features, but it certainly doesn't come through."
"Too heavy on the alcohol to be a good session beer. One of these was enough for me. Glad i tried it, but there are way too many good Belgian Strong Ales to revisit this one, even if it were local to me. Cool name though!"
"Mouthfeel is a bit too thick. I would really like a lighter body with some more carbonation. While we are at it, i would like it to be less sweet. Maybe get some yeast with better attenuation. Also, what is this on the label about a layer of yeast. Is this bottle conditioned or not? I didn't see any in the beer. Also, they have a tendency to call their bottles ""pounders."" At twleve ounces, they are a bit short of a pound. Very confusing overall. While it certainly doesn't hold its own against others of the style, it is an alright beer. I was expecting a lot after loving the category 5 Imperial ESB, but i was disappointed."
"Pours a rich mahogany color with no head and no visible carbonation. The body is crystal clear. The aroma is sweet and malty with a bit of spice in the background. The flavor is overwhelmingly malty with a bunch of spice. The sweetness is pretty strong initially but fades quickly. It is nice and smooth with good body, but that's really the only good part. Not a beer I'd drink again."
"A very enjoyable beer, with some strong taste sensations, but the alcohol content limits its drinkability."
"Drinkability: Why they released this beer I will never know as it is a poor facsimile of a BSDA and a mediocre home brewer could have done better; just a mess from a brewer that makes some great beers"
"I poured this terrible brew into my tumbler at 50 degrees. The beer was a decently nice mahogany color that looked pretty good. But then the smell hit me and that was like soured beer smells the day after it has been in the trash can. The taste was equally sour with a sweetness I just could not stomach. Alcohol taste was way overpowering and too much also. Not buy again."
"Only a whisp of a head, on mahogony brown. Dark beer aroma and boozy. Surprisingly high alcohol. A decent beverage though only passable Belg, not very complex consistent with several American trainees of these styles I have had recently. Medium mouthfeel that goes down in a rush. Sweet with caramel. Drying aftertaste. Number 2400."
"An interesting beer. Big, and not subtle. But it stretches a bit, sugary flavors and alcohol start to overpower everything else. The best overall flavor is in the final throws of the last sip, gentle, warming alcohol, some sugar, some hops in more moderate proportions. Instead of being turned up to 10, this beer should be left at 6. Drop the Uber, keep the rest."
"Beer is good. Happy big beering."
"Holy Sheet isn't bad beer by any means. I hate to let stated style influence me too much, but Clipper City opened themselves up by calling this an abbey ale. If I had 'American strong ale' in my head when I popped the cap, I mind have been more kind. Other than Peg Leg, this is my least favorite of the (mostly) excellent Heavy Seas line of beers."
"This was an pretty average BSDA, although my enthusiasm for the Heavy Sea's line probably adds a bit of bias. The taste is smooth, and the light body makes it an easy drinker, but the booziness keeps you in check. I'm glad I got to try it though, and look forward to seeing if some time in the cellar for my other bottle will turn it into something special. Thanks again John!"
"Cheers."
"Would I like it sweeter and more fruity as the nose suggests? Well it seems like a good idea at first, but when it actually comes down to drinking it, probably not. But the contrast is a little bit of a speedbump at first sip. Regardless, I think this is a great beer, and right up there with the others in the Heavy Seas line. Worth trying!"
"Deep, coppery sort of color. Off white head. Malty and slightly spiced aroma. Big malt flavor with a mellow blend of spice and phenols. The spicyness is more from the alcohol and phenolics then any added ingredient. Somewhat sweet-more so then necessary. Good body. Overall a very nice beer. Not as much ""belgian"" characteristics as I was expecting but a damn good beer none the less."
"Attractive enough on the pour, with a clear, dark cherrywood color and a small amount of quickly-fleeting head. The smell is in-your-face strong and sweet but nonetheless nuanced a bit by dark fruit, brown sugar, and alcohol. In the taste, though, the strong vs. nuanced battle is tipped decidedly toward the strong. Very sweet and alcoholic in the way that cough syrup is. I think there was some spice trying to work its way in, but I couldn't drink more than a couple swallows of this. I like hefty Belgian ales, but this one doesn't work for me. Mouthfeel is full and chewy, but I don't want this taste to linger. Rare is the time I pour any beer down the drain, but I quickly fled this one in favor of a better example of the style."
"Like it...as most Belgium Dark ales...I like what they did with this one...as with most Heavy Seas Brews."
"I would drink this again but probably only if it was given or was really cheap at the store. Still, not bad all the same. Maybe next year they will tweak it a bit. There is nothing in there to make me cry Holy Sheet!"
"I am surprised that at 9% abv I don't detect the alcohol. I would say that this could be a dangerous beer, especially for those with sweet teeth."
"Pours an orangish-red with brown hues. Surprisingly poured with a good inch of frothy off-white head that left a good solid layer of froth on top with good lacing on the glass. Smells are primarily fruits like cherries and fig, but also has some sweet spice characteristics like brown sugar and cinnamon. Taste has some cherries and raisons, but is very much broadcasting its alcohol, almost rum mixed in and not being masked very well. Medium in body though a bit watery, ok carbonation. Not a bad representation of the style, but not extraordinary. I'd pick one up again in next year's batch."
"Good brew, respect the 9% on this medium bodied sweet brew. Only drawback, it can seem alittle to sweet as it warms."
"D - Good, very good. I like Clipper City (having lived in Balmer for several years). I certainly wouldn't mind having this again and I am glad to see the Heavy Seas line expanding."
"This one was alright overall. Balance could be a bit better and it could be beefed up a tad overall to avoid some of its blandness. but its still not bad in the end. Not a stellar example of the style but doesn't do it any injustice at the same time..."
"This beer came in a 12 oz. bottle, and had a strangely illustrated cartoony label that put it firmly in the likeness of its other Heavy Seas siblings. The beer poured out brownish orange in color and lacked a good sized head. The layer of yeast mentioned on the neck label never got loose from its dwelling at the bottom of the sea and showed up in my goblet. The aroma was spicy, warm, and malty, but the lack of earthiness gave this away from being a true Belgian beer. The taste was fruity to brim with the rum soaked raisins, red cherries, and candied apples showing up on the tongue. Unfortunately the alcohol was bracing hot, and there was not enough complexity to mask it. If the yeast had been allowed to dry the mouthfeel some more, the beer would have turned out more charming. May be some age will accomplish this. As released, a bit too hot for my tastes."
"Not much to say about this beer.Its no belgian in my book and I like this brewery alot but this is my least favorite beer from them.This beer falls flat."
"Bottle labeled best by Aug 07. Pours a very dark amber with minimal head and no lacing. Aroma is sugars, alcohol, and yeast with some dark fruit hiding in the background. Taste is dominated by the yeast with dark fruits and malts. Mouthfeel is rather flat and cloying. A one bottle drinker. Not horrible, but not my favorite of the style. I would love to try this fresh on tap."
"and a fresh baked bread yeasty mouthfeel. The finish is smooth with a bakers chocolate note. I would recommend this to any malt fan. This one tends to be on the sweet side."
"fruity again in the flavor profile, though less tart. there's a hint of booze to follow from the aroma's cue but it melds with bitterness"
"While the aroma at least breaks the components into somewhat notable parts, ones it hits the mouth, it's sweet and hot. It takes some effort to make a beer so cloying that the rock candy is the main and really only player. And the ABV is very obvious, which at least helps you decide if it's worth it to experience the mediocrity inherent in the beer itself. For me, it's not."
"Drinkability: Easy drinking and interesting. Will be buying more from a local favorite."
"Deep mahogany brown with a semi-frothy tan head that produced nice sliding laces. Small notes of Belgium yeast and sugar cane in the aroma. But the taste is where this one shines; nice mishmash of plum and cherry, sweet and tart  maybe just a smidgen of cherry cough syrup, but not enough to be a distraction. Smooth and silky texture, Im ready for a couple more."
"Drinkability: I really like what Clipper City's doing with this. I imagine it's not easy emulating a BSDA, especially for the funkiness that you just (usually) don't get with a domestic. Still, at 9%, this is balanced, not too expensive, and a good sipper for folks who don't want to spend an arm and a leg on a caged and corked and / or 11.2 oz. bottle of something imported. Are those most likely going to be better? Yes. But this was a nice treat, and something I'll be buying in the spring (for those late nights) as long as they keep making it."
"A clear brown beer with orangey tints. Not much of a head. Nose is lots of grains, some yeast, and slightly sweet syrup. Taste is sweet malts with some slight bread, and lots of alcohol on the finish. The alcohol is a bit harsh. Mouthfeel is pretty good, and drinkability is hindered only by the ethanol."
"T: Well, this is my first abbey ale. I haven't found too many beers I don't like. But this is one that I can't stand. Anyway, tastes of cherries, rasperry, maybe lingonberry- cough syrup. It seriously made me feel sick. I think I'll stop here. This is the first beer I've had that I had to pour out. Could have been my tastes at the time, but I really didn't feel good after it."
"Not a bad Abbey -good after dinner beer.Could use a bit more character."
"Sometimes I think Clipper City goes overboard with the high alcohol content on their Heavy Seas line, but this one worked pretty well."
"Not a bad brew, just a little hot for me. Not sure if that is par for the style, i'd like to try this again in a few months."
"The beer pours a ruby red color with a 1/2"" offwhite head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is average. It has a nice caramel malt scent along with a slightly fruity Belgian yeast aroma. It's a bit dry with some warming in the nose. The taste is decent. It has a warm crystal malt flavor that goes down easy and finishes with some fruity esters, but nothing special. This is a very bland Belgian style brew, much like Saranac's Belgian ale. It's devoid of any real malt character and the yeast esters are not very pronounced. The mouthfeel is decent. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a dumbed down Belgian brew. It's very forgettable with lots of the real thing available these days."
"A new Heavy Seas offering from Clipper City on tap at the Pizza Plant on Main,poured a medium brown infused with amber a thinner but pretty well sustained light brown head atop.Lighter aromas mainly I picked up some phenolic-like spice and cherry with a hint of brown sugar.Somewhat yeasty flavors a little clove-like spice but a good rich fruitiness shows itself like cherry,bannana even a hit of apricot a decent herbal hop twang comes thru nicely in the finish.Pretty easy going down and flavorful with all the right components to make it a decent Belgian dark ale,I liked it and I am not even a huge fan of the style."
"Recommended."
"Not the best interpretation of the style. A little thin in body with not much head to speak of and no lacing. Tasted okay with some cherry mixed in there but very harsh alcohol dominates the flavor. Maybe I drank this too cold, unsure but not one I will ever refuse if given to me but not one I'll seek out and this is my favorite style of beer."
"Well done brew. I hope they decide to keep it in the lineup for a long time b/c I would put it up there with both Chimay Red, as well as New Belgian Abbey."
"This beer is basically missing all the yeasty goodness. No clove, date, banana, anything like that. Smells like a cherry cough syrup and doesn't taste much better. There's a cheap, alcoholic aftertaste with a hint of chalk, the main flavor best described as medicinal. Call it extreme beer gone bad. Avoid."
"An enjoyable beer, but not the greatest belgian style out there. I'd like to have more of a belgian yeast flavor. This almost seems like a standard ale yeast that fermented warm. It lacks depth and character, but the flavor that is there doesn't have any drawbacks. It's a good beer, and well worth $8.49 a sixer, but I wouldn't go to any extraordinary lengths to get it...."
"Overall another winner in the Heavy Seas brand, keep em' coming!"
"The taste is really good. Full body, just a touch of the alcohol at the end but otherwise very well hidden. As the beer warms it takes on quite a boozy taste and mouthfeel, though. I prefer it cooler than warmer. Complex malts and smooth bitter-sweet flavor. It doesn't have the thick body or head of a good Belgian, but it sure tastes like one. I'd say this is definitely a drinkable beer."
"This is a good beer and easy drinking despite the pronounced booze. Another winner from Heavy Seas/Clipper City."
"Pours a pink-tinted red-brown with brass highlights and exceptional clarity. A dense, off-white head of two and a half finger shows good retention and leaves a few specs of lacing. Rich aroma of sweet, dark fruits and dextrinous highly-kilned malts -but not particularly aromatic. First sip is sweet with caramel and shows some woody peat charater. Date syrup and unrefined sugar flavors emerge; then the semi-dry aftertaste reveals a smooth alcohol taste, Goldings or other mild english flavor hop notes, and a balancing bitterness. The carbonation is actually quite low- but extremely smooth. The body is medium and the lack of crispness allows a malt-centric mouthfeel with robust fruit and booze tones to hang around. Finishes a little hot with plenty of residual caramel and beet sugar; but the velvety mouthfeel alone warrents a respectable drinkability. The only dissapointment here is the lack of Belgian flair; there is no real yeast character to speak of - but its still a decent abbey ale if you want something extra malty."
"Pours amber brown,with a thin tan head. Not much retention,bur good lace. Smell is of dark fruits,and alchol. This is a medium bodied,brew with some carbionation. Taste is of dark fruits. Has a nice rum rasin edge. The alchol is big all the way! Good stuff!"
"Overall, a good, American style Belgian."
"This beer is very drinkable esepcially for a 9-10% ABV beer. After the brewery tour, I bought a six pack to take home and enjoy."
"Another solid performance from Clipper City's heavy seas line. Can't wait to try this beer on draft."
"a dull ruby color, smells of sweet fruits - spiced. Spiced apple? peaches? Hides its alcohol fairly well, with a little astringency on the finish. Mellow carbonation. Good American example of an abbey ale, but I would question its spring release tactic, as this seems more like a December through February beer. The Heavy Seas line over all is a good example of a well-grounded approach to ""extreme"" beer without being retarded about it."
"It's a good stab at the Belgian style. I'll have to drink a few more to see how my impressions change, but I sure am glad that I have more to sample! This is a smooth drinking beer and I can't wait until they put this one on cask! It seems a bit large for a Spring release, but it is still pretty darn tasty! Once again, Clipper City has built another winner!"
