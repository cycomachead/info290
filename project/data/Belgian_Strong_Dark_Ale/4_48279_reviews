"Overall - The oak is funky and weird.  My kneejerk reaction to the first sniff was that something was off, but it never panned out and it's just odd."

"Incredible beer, truly amazing! I should have taken notes, but I know I will drink this again."

"I would have never guessed this beer is as strong as it is, seems so smooth and mild. having not had the base black in awhile, I am amazed how different this seems to be. a whole lot less Belgian and a whole lot more barrel. the bourbon flavors are dominant while the mouthfeel is extremely soft and velvety and almost delicate for such a big brew. dark chocolate and caramel malt comprise the bulk of the grain character, but the bourbon is a major contributor to flavor. vanilla and charred oak compliment the beer nicely, but I am missing much of the belgian yeast character I seem to remember from black. not a bad thing, just a big difference. on tap at the farmhouse in Burlington after a recent allagash event. lucky to have tried this in that format, just beautiful beer from one of the premier producers on American soil."

"A rather dark, dark brown - straight black coffee color. Gorgeous thick, foamy, khaki head that sticks around for awhile. The nose is subtle but dark chocolate, Belgian yeast, light bourbon and oak, some dark fruits and as it warms I am picking up on the coconut. The taste is wonderful - much lighter on the bourbon character than other BA'ed beer, which was great - not overdone, but added subtlety to an already favorite of mine - sweet dark malts, dark and milk chocolates and Belgian peppery and spicy yeast but with an added layer of bourbon, oak and burnt sugars. Really enjoyed this. I found the mouth-feel was a little richer and smoother than the light body of the regular Black. All in all really wonderful and thankful to have stumbled across this."

"750ml bottle: This one poured a very dark opaque brown color. There was just a bit of a tan head that doesn’t linger long or leave much lacing. The aroma is a little lighter than expected. Not too much bourbon to the nose. Bready, chocolate, roastiness, some pine and citrus hops. The taste is very good. The bourbon flavor is more subdued than some other bourbon barrel aged beers that I’ve had. Chocolate, some roastiness, somewhat bitter. Touch of sweetness in finish. Very Nice!"

"O: A nicely layered and complex brew. Just the right amount of barrel presence to make itself known, as it's not overwhelming by any means. Certainly don't go in expecting to be overpowered by the barrel. Pricey, but worth it at least once"

"I thoroughly enjoyed the regular Black so a little let down after this, thinking that the bourbon barrel aging could smooth it out even more as well as add an extra dimension in taste and mouthfeel. Perhaps it will in a bottle that's aged but this review is of a glass I had on tap from a not at all aged keg. Poured a brownish, almost black body, with one finger tan head that died slow and left some lace down glass. Strong malty aroma of roasted malts, some dark chocolate and there is a alcohol, bourbon like aroma with some wood in there. This is where I find this version slightly below the standard from regular black, as the strong roasted and wood type malts and flavors overpower, even while smoothing out this fuller bodied beer, the minor sweet malts (caramel, chocolate) and the hopiness and dark fruit flavors. It is more of a coffee or javalike sweetness and bitter chocolate all while going down easy than a balanced Belgian ale with sweetness and touches of yeast, hops and fruit flavors. Still would recommend this anyone who enjoyed the Black but just thought this effort was just off the mark."

"Not really black, but rather a very dark mahogany hued body with a fat, tight head. The aroma is fairly mellow to start: light chocolate, coconut, and vanilla bean. Light on the roast and no real trace of yeast. Very smooth, well-integrated flavors like Belgian chocolate, tobacco, rich malt, and creamy vanilla. I don't go crazy for bourbon barrel aged beers in general, as frequently I find them to be over the top, eclipsing the base beer with straight whiskey booze. This was beautifully done, the bourbon being subtle and working with the dark maltiness of Black, making it superior to the original in my eyes. Medium bodied and silky smooth. Not hot or boozy at all. This was the final beer I had during a rather satisfying evening of special and/or draft-only Allagash brews, and this was the surprise winner for me. I look forward to finding it again..."

"O: Fantastic bourbon stout. Totally worth the freezing cold."
""

"A pleasant sip of no great distinction but with an aromatic woody flavor. On tap at Tiger! Tiger! in San Diego."

"O: Tasty, goes down very easily, not too filling, strong kick, good representation of style, this is a very good dark beer to drink for a long time."
""
"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was the huge bourbon through the mouth and nose. This also gave a surprising smoky quality to the flavoring, making the bourbon flavoring out of this world. Everything makes for such a warming brew, with big booze, a hearty malty background, and a totally inclusive blend. The original base beer has truly found a glorious buttery home in barrel aging."
""
""
""
""
"I like this. I’ve enjoyed the regular Allagash Black and this adds a nice layer to an already good beer. The bourbon isn’t overpowering, mixed in very nicely with the nice balance of a roasty Stout and Belgian Ale."
""
""
"Solid black pour (at least it seemed so in the dim light) with a small tannish head; minimal retention and lacing. Aroma of dark malts, chocolate, distant hints of vanilla and bourbony wood. The bourbon element is more mellow in this beer, which is nice, otherwise flavors of dark malts, cocoa, some dark fruit and vanilla, and a bit of bready yeast and ash. On the heavier side of medium bodied, flavorful and nicely crafted."

"Aging in bourbon barrels really adds a whole new dimension to this beer that puts it a decent cut above the original. Booziness is present but not overpowering... instead bringing out the robust dark fruit and chocolate flavors. Definitely worth a try."
""
"The pour is a very dark brown color with a creamy off-white head. Nose is heavy on the roast with light bourbon aroma (more oak than anything). Lightly peppery with a hint of fruit, mostly banana. There is just a touch of coffee. The flavor has an interesting smokiness to it, perhaps from the char of the barrel? Mild bourbon and vanilla notes, some dark fruit, pepper, and lots of roasted malts. A hint of bitter chocolate, some banana, and a bit of booze."
"D - Not bad, but a bit too much bourbon and anise for my tastes. It's nice for a small pour, but gets a bit fatiguing after a while."
"Overall an amazing beer. With a great mouthfeel and a taste that is (to steal Armin Van Buuren's adjective) massive! No harsh notes whatsoever and the alcohol is so well hidden it's amazing. I think this is a limited release.... or maybe only on tap. Anyway that's sad because this beer is one of the best I've ever had."
""
""

"Had this on tap at the Brick Store Pub. Just a lovely beer, and the thing that really makes this beer is just how well integrated all of the flavors are. Beautifully silky in the mouth, the glass keeps releasing all of these wonderful notes, one after the other- chocolate, vanilla, roasted grains, fruity esters, smooth and mellow Bourbon, a touch of cream. This beer isn't about being slapped upside the head and dragged into a back alley, it's about being seduced. Each flavor seamlessly progresses to the next, and nothing is overdone. Through the artistry of the brewer, and a deft hand with barrel aging, this beer has been crafted into a unified whole that emits a siren song that keeps you coming back for another quaff. Entirely too drinkable for the abv, and altogether very pleasant."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Not too different from regular Black. Where's the Jim Beam? Aged for a whole year, seriously? Sad. But drinks great for sure."
"O - Glad I had this. Allagash is on to something with bbl'ing Belgians. It definitely works, I'm sure the base beer is great but the bourbon makes this beer amazing."
""
"Overall: This and Odyssey are now my two favorite Allagash beers. I love this one because the bourbon adds to the beer and does not take over until the end. The base is chewy complex chocolate--almost like fine candy..Not overly sweet but fine candy. The bourbon at the end melts in my mouth. If I can find this again, I will get it in a heartbeat. Superior beer."
""
""
"Pours an almost opaque super dark brown with a tan head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Foamy rings of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, cocoa, wood, and subtle bourbon. Taste is of dark roasted malt, cocoa powder, wood, and some mild bourbon flavors. There is a slight alcohol warmth in the back of the throat with each sip. This beer has a light level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good barrel aged beer but it tastes better than it smells."
""
"This is a well crafted BA version of Black. A smooth, easy drinker with complex flavors, but they aren't overly robust. The only thing that really pops is the bourbon/oak."
"Taste is spot on. Its got the nice roasted characteristic of black ales, but the bourbon accents it nicely. Smooth and drinkable, I would say well done Allagash."
""
"O - Highly recommended, such complexity. This has the complexity of any highly rated RIS that could be enjoyed next to a fire OR with those fantastic coconut notes, this would be excellent on a cool summer night. Allagash, it would be a favor to the beer community if you could bottle this up. Definitely on my must try again list."
"O - The best thing about this beer was how easy it was to drink at 10% while still managing to have some big flavors. Very smooth, pretty nice beer."
""

""
"On tap at Rusticos poured into a sampler glass. Pours black with a creamy, tan head. Dark, roasted malts make up the nose. Flavor is sweet, roasty, with notes of chocolate, brown sugar, caramel and coffee. Medium bodied with average carbonation. Finishes sweet with dark malts and mocha, but not much bourbon. Quite a quaffable beer."
"Poured on-tap and served in a chalice, the beer is a vibrant, dark, light looking brown coloring with a steady, low flow of carbonation bubbling and a ring of white foam on the surface. Aromas are rich, with molasses, booze, toffee, and nut, with an earthy undertone. Flavors are extremely smooth and balanced, with raisin, date, and fig sweetness, bourbon and earthy backbone, and a sharp, slightly bitter tone at the end of the palate. The aftertaste is slick and rich, with molasses sweetness and slightly peppery tones, with an extra boozey kick. The finish is dry and quick, leaving a clean palate. Good and strong, this is an impressive brew."
"Overall this is a super beer. I usually do not care for Spirit Barrel Aged Belgian beers because the flavor profiles just dont meld well usually, but this is quite nice and I am quite glad I was able to sample this. Not too intense that it overpowered your tastebud like many BA stouts can do and the BA really helps to balance the Belgian yeasty flavors which are also sometimes too dominant. Just really nice overall; hope I can sample again in the future."

"Pours black w/ a thin head into my snifter glass. No light can get through this beer. Smell is bourbon, anise, and slight alcohol- fairly uncomplex and inspiring. Taste is disappointing- There's just not much there to taste. I'd hoped for big flavors from this beer, and it didn't deliver. Feel is thin, and a little on the dry side for what this should be. Overall, the regular Black is far better. Something is lost in translation to this brew. Cheers."
"O: Another solid offering. I liked how it wasn't a Bourbon bomb, and I certainly thought the beer improved with barrel aging. The price on this one was $4.5 for a 4oz, which I'm thinking was worth it. I would give this one another go. A nice treat from Rustico! 4.5"

"D - Some times barrel aging ruins a good beer. Allagash does this properly make a great beer that much better. If this were available outside of festivals and other events I would drink it all the time."
"Big shoutout goes out to the individuals who supplied me with this one to share! Shared with caSSino and the crew at NoDa Brewing for a celebration of their grand opening! Served from growler into a Mikkeller taster flute. Poured a dark ruby red brown with a half finger light tan head that subsided to a minimal amount quickly. Maintained phenomenal lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, roasted malt, caramel, wood, sweet alcohol, and dark fruit. The flavor was of sweet malt, dark fruit, wood, subtle sweet alcohol, and caramel. It had a medium feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. I had this one awhile back while at Brewvival this year and I remembered it being pretty good, so I jumped on the opportunity to try it again. The growler version of this one had quite a nice nose and flavor profile going on in it. While being quite complex, everything was very nicely laid out as far as intensity so all of the components of the brew were detectable. A definite must try if you have the opportunity!"
"O: nice blend of favors and aromas. Impressed"
"O: The beer is relatively easy to drink considering its strength because the alcohol is well masked from the taste (except for that from the bourbon) and the beer isn’t that full bodied."
"Very good and flavorful beer. the taste and smell collaborate nicely"
"Hoping that this is the right beer that I'm reviewing. At the 2010 ACBF I tried the Allagash Bourbon Black which I'm not seeing on here. If this isn't the same hopefully someone will let me know and I'll add the beer and review that one. Anyway, This beer poured out as a really nice black color, not too much head or lacing. The smell of a nice roasted stout blended with a light vanilla aroma was very pleasing on the nose. The taste of the beer was really well balanced with the bourbon flavors and the roasted malts. The mouthfeel wasn't overly thick at all here. Overall I had to say it was one of the better beers I tried that day at the Festival. Highly enjoyable brew."
"Taste is deep and stout-like, with a bit of alcohol burn unique to this version of the beer. Full-bodied and thick, just the way I like a beer, but again, not typical Belgian-style. Overall a great beer I'd drink any time."
"Overall I was impressed with this beer – the bourbon manages to integrate nicely with the existing flavor profile and doesn’t cross the threshold into overkill. Well worth a shot."
"Overall a solid beer and it showcases barrel aged notes likely. I wish it was a bit thicker in the mouthfeel though and maybe some more background flavor to mingle with the barrel notes."
"Overall: This beer is quite different from anything I can remember trying. I thought it was a little too bitter given the other flavors, but definitely not a bad beer. Not sure if I want more or not."
"O: Too much bourbon, not enough backbone or depth, mouthfeel doesn't live-up to a year in a barrel."
"O: Overall, a pretty decent beer. The bourbon isn't extremely strong or sweet, but still manages to conceal most of the original flavors of the beer."
"O: This is a great barrel aged beer if you like bourbon.... which I do."
"On tap this past Saturday night at American Craft in Brookline. Served in a 10 oz goblet. Dark black color, as the name implies. Smallish head but some lacing. Smell just hits you with the bourbon - oh yeah, it's aged nicely. Taste was also spot on. Loved the balance between the nice roasted flavors of the stout and the sweet and tangy flavors from the bourbon. A perfect melding of the two flavors. Mouthfeel was very smooth but boozy at the same time. Alcohol was very noticeable. An awesome example of a barrel aged stout, but be warned: it's served in a small glass for a reason. This guy packs a punch."
"Pours a dark brown (surprising considering the name) with a creamy head. Good aromas of oak, chocolate malt, and Belgian yeast. Nice and roasty with good Belgian stout flavors, but not getting much Bourbon, which is a shame. Slightly creamy, with a medium body and crisp carbonation. Not bad, but where the heck is the Bourbon?"
"There's not much I really have to say about this beer that I haven't already conveyed in my review of the straightforward Allagash Black. It's clearly aged in Bourbon barrels (although since I had it on tap I wasn't aware of that until I tasted it). I'd remembered liking the Black because it wasn't overdone. It was soft, and supple, and relaxed, and to be honest, this is very much the same. The Bourbon is not overblown at all, and it simply adds some Bourbon flavor, a bit of wood, and a light note of vanilla. Does it help the already complex ""Black""? Probably not. If anything, it may distract you from the subtle nuances that were already there. But it IS an interesting change. And to a certain extent, it becomes almost like another beer, rather than just a beer that's been ""Bourbon barrel aged"". I like them both equally, and I can't choose one over the other. That would simply depend on my mood. So, with that said, I'd say it's worth trying to be sure. Especially for those who enjoy Bourbon barrel aged beers. And on that note let me add one more thought: given that it's a Bourbon barrel beer, I still found it quite drinkable, which is not always the case. Nicely done with a restrained hand. Worth trying."
"I know I'm a beer guy as I am at a valentine choc tasting with my wife and her best friend discussing weddings and enjoying it. Oh yeah the pairing were with rares or limited beers"
"Drinkability: Leave it to the folks at Allagash to bourbon barrel age a Belgian stout and to do it with such a light hand as to complement rather than dominate the beer itself; a first class effort"
"I had this on tap at the High street grill, poured into a small goblet. The pour is jet black, white one inch head, no lacing. The beer smells like bourbon soaked dates and plums. It has sweet bourbon notes, along with dark fruit, vanilla, and oak. It has a warming, lingering finish. The body is medium, light carbonation. Bourbon black is the most drinkable big beer I have ever had. I really enjoyed it, strongly recomended."
"I was a little disappointed in this beer. It's good, but couldn't hold itself up on a day against other bourbon barrel-aged beers. The taste isn't as complex or as pronounced as I would like."
"D- I liked it I don't love it, this did not spend much time in the barrel,old curieux barrels perhaps."
"D- this is allagash black in a barrel that's for sure. Not the best bsda I've ever had or bourbon aged beer for that matter. Its good and all just not a knock your sock s off kind of thing."
"Pours black, of course. A bit of of a tan head and some lacing. Nose brings roasted malt, wood, vanilla, some barrel characteristics, and hints of dark drugs. Taste adds in some molasses with all he flavors melding well. Feel is nice and slightly boozy. Drinks quite well; one of the better Allagash beers ai have had."
"d - I thought this was a very enjoyable barrel aged beer. I liked it a little bit better than the normal Allagash black and thought there was a good level of bourbon in the nose and taste. Would try again."
"Color is dark cola brown, opaque and thick with a creamy light tan head that produces thick sheets of lacing. Aroma is mild in strength and dominated by bourbon, vanilla and oak. Very smooth and subtle, but a little boring. Flavor is bourbon forward without being overly boozy or sweet. Finish is slightly bitter and astringent, with a mild dark fruit flavor and oak sweetness. Body is thick and silky smooth with minimal carbonation. Overall this isn't bad but was disappointgly boring and the base beer is overwhelmed by the barrel aging. Yawn."
"overall very, very happy with this one, would love to do it again any day."
"Nothing mind blowing here, but this is a solid beer from Allagash, and will be especially attractive for those who enjoy a splash of bourbon in their beer."
"Come for the Founders goodies, stay for the other goodies they've got assembled for your enjoyment. This one pours a very dark opaque black-brown topped by a half-finger (at best) of ecru macro-foam. The nose comprises bourbon, oak, dull chocolate, roasted malts, toffee, and a hint o' vanilla in there somewhere. The taste is very similar, with more chocolate and roasted malts and the inclusion of newcoming molasses. The body is a solid medium, with a slightly biting carbonation and a spitefully smooth feel. Overall, a very nice Belgian stout; doesn't overdo it with the bourbon barrel influences, and everything melds together very nicely."
"For what it is, this was a very pleasant surprise and not gimmicky at all. Served in a snifter; black in appearance, with a thin white head. Strong aromas of bourbon, oak and vanilla go along with roasted malts. It tastes very much like it smells, with the high alcohol content and the bourbon barrel flavors combining to give the impression you are, in fact, drinking bourbon. But this is not a harsh drink, because there are also complementary malt flavors and a rich, smooth mouthfeel. This works well in small quantities, with dessert or as a digestif."
"I would have again and this was not bad again did not overwhelm or surprize me worth a try though !"
"Cheers!"
"Reviewed from my notes, served in a tulip glass at the Great Lost Bear. The beer is a black liquid with a tan foam head. I can see foam and small bubbles rising within the dark liquid. There is a great layer of foam coating left behind as I drink the beer. I can distinguish some sweet malts in the aroma. There isn't much bourbon character here, it is more of an oak aroma. The taste of the beer begins with a a little sweet caramel up front. I can also taste creamy chocolate. A roasted coffee bitterness comes through in the finish. There is a little bit of the bourbon, but not much. What is there is present throughout. Based on the casked version of Curieux I have had in previously, I expected a lot more bourbon flavor--I'm slightly disappointed the bourbon isn't stronger. It has a medium body and feels creamy. There is just the right amount of foamy carbonation. This beer feels like a great example of a stout and a great example of a casked beer. For a Bourbon barrel-aged big stout, this beer is remarkably drinkable. Each sip is satisfying, but leaves me excited to have another. The 7.5% ABV is completely masked. I could easily drink a number of glasses of this beer."
"Nose is lightly roasted, with hints of those vanilla beans and bourbon casks. Slightly soapy as well, lowering the score a half tick. The taste profile is great - the vanilla and bourbon mix seamlessly with the roasted malt. Some chocolate notes emanate from the roast, along with a hint of espresso. Plenty of boozy notes, along with a lighter tropical hint. The cask engine has left this one extremely smooth and creamy. Finish is so silky, and the booze barely registers in the taste. Outstanding beer."
"D- A nice barrel aged beer; the finish was a little too hot I think, but aging this would be very interesting."
"I am sommelier and have worked with fine wines for 10 years. I never could quite appreciate beer until after I developed my palate with wine. From my wine knowledge came my love of craft beer and intelligence to recognize the flavor profiles that are omnipresent in beer, translating to bliss on my palate. This beer to me was like sipping a '65 Margaux, only cheaper and more fun to evaluate. The bottle/label itself screams drink me and when you start to pour it you are overwhelmed with a rich, bourbon-chocolate aroma. The aroma also included a sweet cream of coconut and butter. I poured mine into a lightly chilled snifter because I wanted to evaluate the beer at different temps, and as the beer warmed the better it got. The appearance is rich chocolate brown with a steady lacing and thick toffee head. The flavor is impressive, but a little hot at first. The vanilla tones really help balance the beer on the palate, while the roasted citrus, oak, chocolate, plum, and coffee complete the journey around the tongue. Very rich and creamy, almost enough so serve over ice cream. For being as dark as it is I was expecting more body but was incredibly satisfied with its medium body and velvety smoothness that lingered delightfully for a while. Very rounded, full, and balanced beer, truly remarkable. I decided to pair this beer with a dry-aged prime rib eye, which turned out to be the right choice as the rich fatty meat complimented the deep flavors of the beer and the aged authentic balsamic I used brought out the sweetness of the brew. I highly recommend this beer and am now spoiled by yet another fantastic Allagash creation."
"Bit disappointed, if I wanted to drink Jim Beam, I'd order that and just have the regular Allagash Black as a chaser."
"D: This is a phenomenal beer. I wanted another glass, but I had to get going. Dangerously drinkable at 9.3%. I hope to see this again sometime in the near future"
"Lots going on here. It has some nice flavors, but they don't seem to belong and don't contrast well. Its basically lots of great beers blended, not always the best thing. At EBF I blended PtY, Supplication, CBS, and a touch of Utopias, they're all really REALLY great beers on their own, but tasted bad together. Much like this one."
"D: This is another high-quality brew from Allagash. Although I have to say I prefer the non barrel aged version of the Black. I had it on cask in the same sitting and it was much fruitier and had more nuance. Big plum and red grape, semi sweet. As subtle as the bourbon was in the -bbl aged, it hindered the complexity."
"Served in a .25cl Allagash tulip. Poured the color of cola with a mere swirl of foam comprising the head, and a tight band around the perimeter of the glass. Nose is very subdued; some brewer's licorice - nose seems closer to a baltic porter. Taste reveals a little bourbon, a hint of a medicinal quality and black licorice; there's also a slightly vinous quality (once again reminiscent of a baltic porter). Mouthfeel was light/medium with a fairly subdued background effervescence. Happy to try this, but I'm a bigger fan of the standard Black. Certainly worth a try if you have the opportunity, but not the best example of barrel-aging from this brewer."
"I am just a sucker for these stouts...Poured deep, rich, black into the snifter, thick beige head that eventually became the lacing. Aroma of roasted malts, dark chocolate, oak and bourbon. Taste was the same as the aroma, with a full-bodied, full-flavour mouthfeel. What makes this different from other stouts? Probably the fullness of the flavours, highly drinkable...if I can find any more!!!"
"A rare treat that I was glad to enjoy in the company of Rob Tod from Allagash."
"If you're a fan of the original Black, barrel aged beers, or just a fan of Allagash, then you need to try this beer. I was told that this was only a one time beer. That's too bad because I would certainly love another glass of this wonderful beer."
"Poured a dark black color with a smaller sized off white/tan head. Aromas of roastiness, woody, smoke, vanilla, and a trace (if any) of bourbon. Tastes of vanilla, woody/oak, dark fruits, roasty, chocolate, the same smokiness, and vanilla. If I wasn't told this was done in a Bourbon Barrel, I would have just guessed Oak Aged."
"This is Black aged for 10 months in bourbon barrels. Pours a near black color with a thick brown head. The nose has dark roasty malts, peppery Belgian yeasts, chocolate and whiskey. The barrel aging for sure added another layer of complexity to the nose, but I'm not sure it had much of an affect on the flavor profile. The taste is however a bit more rounded. Not quite as roasty as the regular Black. The body is not as full as I expected, but still drinks well."
