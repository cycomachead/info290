"A bit more of a bitter bite when compared to something like Local 2. Still a very serviceable Belgian style ale. (Borderline 4? My expectations were high.)"
""
""
""
""
"Good but just shy of upper class. Would have again."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a dark brown, almost black with a khaki colored head that trailed the glass. The smell was full of sweet malt with dark fruits like plum on the nose. The taste was great with some stout flavors like coffee up front and then the dark fruits such as plum and banana come through to give a semi-sweet finish. Loved it."
""
"Overall, this is tasty, but falls a little short of the standards of the style."
"Aroma is rich peaty malt.Pours nearly midnight black with a full long lasting beige head. Laces glass fully to the bottom. Taste of oatmeal bread, dark fruits, sour cherries, alchoholic bite."
""
"Black with off white head. Sweeten bread, beefy yeast, wet malt. Tad lighter Belgian with a velvety mouth feel."
"Overall- There is a nice balance of sweetness with dry bitterness, malts are sugary sweet, fruity, and play nicely off a bitterness throughout and oaky dry finish. Wonderful belgian phenols throughout, strong yeasty, bready, and earthy flavors."

"A very pleasant creamy dark beer.  Again, watch the ABV which is high as many of this style can be."

"O: This beer wasn't horrible, but I wasn't blown away by any means. It could be that I've had beers of this style that were more complex, or maybe I'm just not a huge fan of this beer in particular. I am a huge fan of Brewery Ommegang however, and this is the only beer I've had from them that I didn't like. In my opinion, it was over carbonated and a bit too sweet for my tastes. I love Brewery Ommegang, but I most likely won't drink this beer again. To quote Billy Bob Thornton in the movie Bad Santa ""They can't all be winners!"""

"Damn, this is a bit of a disappointment. The flavors aren't great and the pungent bourbon flavor is unpleasant."
""

"Bottle: Poured a clear black color ale with a large off-white foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of candi sugar with light dry fruit notes is quite sublime. Taste is also a great mix of candi sugars with some dried fruits and a solid Belgian malt backbone. Body is full enough for style with great carbonation and no apparent alcohol. Some spices can also bed detected. Very solid offering and this is a beer I could have more regularly."

"Bottle from Proof Bottle Shop. Thick and pitch black with tan head that persisted fairly well. Collar hung until the end. Lots of dark malt, some sour cherry, some coffee, and a touch of grassy funk in the aroma. Taste is nearly identical to the smell, with a bit more of the sour cherry and grassy funk being prominent. Nice thick creamy mouthfeel. Very full bodied. Great after taste and a Guinness like mouthfeel."
""
""
""
"O: Meh. I wouldn't have another, but if you like BSDA (and I generally do) definitely try it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I was expecting a little more Belgian in this ""Belgian-style Dark Ale."" It's a little more of a sour than I was expecting, with the fruit forward-ness and funk. The beer is good, but not exceptional."
"Drinkability was good, but not great, I split the bottle with a friend, and that was plenty. Overall, a pretty nice brew, and one I'm glad I tried. I probably won't grab another bottle, but if I see it on tap I'll certainly have another."

"750 ml caged and corked bottle, packaged on 10/30/12, best by 10/2015. Served in a tulip, the beer pours dark brown with about an inch tan head. Head retention is good, and there's a small amount of lacing. The brew smells like dark fruit, molasses, peppery spice, and some coffee and chocolate. Taste is similar to the aroma, but there's also some tart cherries and candi sugar noticeable. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit slick and has moderate carbonation. I think it's a good brew and definitely worth trying. But it's also a bit pricey at $13.99 a bottle."

"Big bottle, corked, dark, Belgian style. Life is good.. It looks more like a porter than anything Belgian, black with a dense tan head. Smells of carob, raisins, hay, and lemons. I think my mom made that as a soup once. The taste is very nice, leather, bread, a graininess, and then a dry finish. The mouthfeel is substantial, slick, and lightly carbonated. Overall, this is really a nice beer. It is dry, maybe a bit too much so but that just makes you want to drink some more, so good on ya!"

"Flavor is nice but seems to lack a little complexity compared to some of the finer examples of the style. Has a lot Moore roast character than typical and not a sweet. Fewer dark fruits. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but the mouthful is a little heavy as well. Not quite what I was expecting, but worth a try. Might try again but to be honest the $15 might deter."
"Overall a different sort of BSDA/quad. Not as sugary sweet as most. Enjoyable."
""
""
"This is a delicious brew. Its one of the best brews Ommegang puts out. Rich and ripe with dark sweet fruits with some good bready notes and some good Belgian-style yeast notes."

"O: This beer is very easy to drink and hides its alcohol very well but lacks the complexity compared to the top beers in this style."
"Overall a pretty good beer, but not a great one. It seems to be lacking the complexity I expect from this style, but is still a good beer. It would be interesting to see how this beer ages, very possible aging would bring out more depths of flavor. Worth a try, I am tempted to get another bottle and age it just to see what it does to the flavor."
"O- A beer by this name I was going in expecting a stout dark beer but thats not what this beer is. The beer has a lot going for it but is otherwise dominated by a grainy flavor. Would drink again but not for the price."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall impression is good, very good, but the forward alcohol and the carbonation level (while not high on its own) combine to make this less smooth than I'd hoped. One glass in, I want to finish the bottle, but I'm not sure the last will be as enjoyable as the first."
""
"O: Excellent brew – complex flavors and aromas and enough alcohol to make it interesting."

"750 ml bottle into signature tulip glass, bottled on 2/20/2012. Pours moderately cloudy extremely dark reddish brown color with a 2 finger dense and fluffy khaki head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Spotty foamy lacing clings on the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of big raisin, prune, apple, pear, molasses, toast, toffee, chocolate, dark bread, light roast, pepper, clove, floral, and yeast earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of dark malt and fruity/spicy yeast ester notes; with good strength. Taste of raisin, prune, apple, molasses, toast, chocolate, dark bread, toffee, floral, light roast, clove, pepper, and yeast earthiness. Lingering notes of dark and light fruits, molasses, toast, toffee, chocolate, dark bread, floral, light roast, clove, pepper, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice balance and complexity of dark malts with yeast ester flavors; with zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a creamy, moderately slick, and lightly foamy mouthfeel that is very nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with hardly any warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is and excellent Belgian strong dark ale! All around nice balance and complexity of dark/roasted malt and yeast ester flavors; and very smooth to sip on for a the gravity. A very enjoyable offering."

"If you drink Ommegang then you are accustomed to a certain amount of art and this beer has that. It’s dark, looks menacing, tricky with the light and smells tempting and sweet. Drinks smooth and not too spicy . The fruits are so light and so well done. Plum stays plum and never turns to prune. Malt stands up straight and strong with a touch of roast, and plenty of bread to make this a very elegant beer."
""
""

"O: Terrific complexity on this one. The alcohol is a little harsh, but this is a really fine American take on a strong dark Belgian ale....especially the aroma."

"If I didn't know better, I'd guess this to be a Trappist beer. It's really that good and the taste and feel are world class. Despite the high alcohol, it's an easy beer to drink. It's so good it begs you to take another swig. Really happy with this beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"D - A very solid beer. As usual from Ommegang. I don't think they're capable of putting out anything sub-birdie."
""
""

"Still a wonderful brew. Maybe not worth the price though. There are better options."

"For the style, 75/100. For personal taste, 82/100. Overall, 79/100."
""
""

"O: A love this beer, it's fruity, dark and spicy Belgium that goes down a little too smooth. I don't want it with dessert, I want it for dessert; that being said it would go great with a vanilla custard or berry tart."
""
""
""
""
"I do enjoy this. Though the tart fruits just don't mesh well with the toasted and bready malts. I am not sure if that is what it is suppose to taste like, but there you have it. Still, I am glad I tried. Though not one of their better offerings IMO."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Tastey and drinkable."
""
""
""
"Overall this is a pretty decent BSDA, nothing too amazing but for the price I got it at I would definitely have it again"
""
"The taste is in line with scent as raisin and sweet dried fruits dominate. There is a black licorice note at the end and a sugary sweetness. Very easy on the palate with pleasant sweetness. This Belgian Strong is a very good example of the sort."
""
""
"Overall: A fun one to try. I don't know if I'd repurchase any time soon, many things to try, but I'll revisit it for sure. If you like dark ales, then this is an obvious choice to at least try."
""
""
"O: Overall an exceptionally smooth, clean and very easy to consume offering. The dark malt base is more schwarz then double stout, and is sweet creamy and smooth like swiss chocolate. The noble flowers really shine here while the chocoalte malt is so silky sweet and refined. The yeast brings a good deal to the table too with its pear and banana offering and things finish out as strong as they started. Ommegang is not going to slam you in the face with a bold aggressive nature and flavor, thier beers are shown to be exceptionally clean and polished with a delicate and eloquent balance that shows off the slightest nuances that is to be appreciated. Definitly worth a try."
""
""
""
"The taste, like the aroma, is complex with dark fruits that are more like cherries, black licorice, and even a little coffee. The alcohol can be spotted but it is generally well-integrated into the beer. The hop bite is muted at the end but it builds and lingers with each passing sip. I guess I liked it better than the previous raters."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a deep magenta with a dirty cream colored head. Aroma was of some dark fruits (dark cherries, figs, plum) and somce cocoa. Flavor followed suit with the dark fruits standing out and a nice little underlying of some chocolate and some caramel malt. A medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, not my favorite style but Ommegang did a very nice job with this one allowing me to enjoy it a good deal. Probably not a beer I would have enjoyed as my opener to the night, but a beer that worked well as my closer."
""
""
""
"Pours an almost opaque super dark brown with a foamy dark khaki head that settles to a film on top of the beer. A foamy curtain of lace coats the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, cocoa, and slight dark fruit aromas. Taste is much the same with a slightly sour fruity flavor on the finish. There is a mild amount of roasty bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer with some interesting aromas and flavors but nothing all that exciting."

""
""
"O - decent if not overly memorable, makes me think a properly cellared version (who knows how long it was on the TWine shelf) may have been smoother and more complex."
""
""
"Overall a decent beer, but it's a bit too non descript, without much character. I've come to expect more from Ommegang."
""
"O - An interesting change-up from Ommegang. Not the best of the style by a longshot, but a very enjoyable offering from a local brewery that just nails Belgian styles."
""
"Overall: Actually a delicious brew. Quite mellow and enjoyable, but also presented a strong-flavored body. Really enjoyed this beer and will have to try again if and when its available."
""
""
""
"A decent Belgian brew. Well made but not distinct, nothing really stands out and the carbonation is way too strong. Not really sure why they made this beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a mostly opaque reddish brown with a thin tan head that disappears quickly. One of the darkest quads I've ever tried. Also one of the driest. A fairly high carbonation is apparent from the first pour. The smell is yeasty and not much else. The taste is rye bread, malts, a hint of hops and very little sweetness of any kind. The beer is a bit boozie a result. Mouthfeel is good, nice carbonation, and not too thin. Basically my only complaint is it needs some sweetness to balance it out. Otherwise worth a try."
"Overall: An interesting and very good example of the style. Pleased to have picked this up. Another quality statement from BO."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I felt that the beer was a little too roasty for a Belgian Strong, and that it was a bit overcarbonated. I wanted more phenolic character, but it was masked behind the roasted flavors. Much of its Belgian yeast character was not brought to the forefront. It's not a bad beer at all. I felt that despite everything, it was a relatively average beer. I will enjoy my beer, but won't be looking for this beer anytime soon."
""
""
"O-A nice beer but it doesn't have anything that stands out, had it with some age on it, maybe fresh it would be better."
"This beer is a deep, nearly black, brown color. It reveals slight red highlights when held to the light. The head is fizzy and short-lived. The aroma is of brown sugar and candied fruit, dark malt and Belgian yeast, pepper and a distant, fleeting smoke-scent. Nice. The taste is sharp with alcohol and carbonation. Warming and malty, with dark fruit and yeast. It seems highly attenuated, yet is sugary on the lips. Full and satisfying body."
""
""
"Well-suited for sipping while reading on a cold, wet autumn day. This is an interesting rendition of the style."
"Overall, disappointing. A decent beer but nothing exciting. Not something I would go for again."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A really good take on a dark Belgian ale. It has the fruit esters and spices of a Dubbel and the roasted characteristics of a Stout. Really nicely done."
"Notes: outstanding, tasty, yummy."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I worked on Art of Darkness for over two hours and I enjoyed it more with each sip. One to let warm. An easy recommendation."
""
"O - I bought two bottles of this because they both stated ""Limited Addition"" on the label. Glad I did! I'll drink one myself and save the other to share with my family over Christmas, and will certainly grab more if I see it. It has a very well balanced taste, nothing overwhelming, everything working in concert to yield a fantastic, warming ale."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"M - Medium body; creamy. Moderate carbonation. A little too much carbonation."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: exceptionally enjoyable and better than expected, even from a premier American producer of Belgian style beers."
"Poured from Champagne bottle into a Duvel glass. Pours dark black with full thick head of 1/2 inch brown foam. The laye remains. Dark fruit smell. Oats. Plums, subtle raisin nose. Taste is fruity blend, mostly dark fruit - plums. Strong Belgian yeast. Some chocolate notes. Much happening - all good."

"I really enjoy this beer. The flavor is rich and complex. The fruit is a nice balance to the big malt bill. The yeast comes through but doesn't take over. Overall, very enjoyable and worth trying."

"This is a great dessert brew. Aptly named, this is truly a work of art!"

""

"O- easy to drink at a 8.9 clip. tasty, the bitterness is not too bad at all. someone mentioned he allowed some of the yeasty sediment to pour into the glass and it seemed ""smoother"". the little bit of yeast i tried with it came out a bit tangy but i dont think it was meant to be poured in as a hefe weizen is. i'm flashing back to the days of the Thomas Hardy Ales . . . . back then, THAT was the WORST of all the beers on the DER BARON's list to finish in Las Vegas... does anybody remember DER BARON's???"
""
""
""
""
"A Lovely thick head atop a very dark clear but opaque black brow fluid. Some lace here and there. Smell is sweet with dark fruits. Raisins and figs, brown bread and yeasty esters of banana. Taste is complex with a firm sweet malt body and notes of licorice and anise. Some chocolate and cocoa/mocha. There is a very faint alcoholic edge in the finish and that quickly faded to a sweet warmth. Bitterness is low but adding the yeast by agitating did seem to all a bit of light chalkiness to the finish while at the same time adding a smoothness. Curious. Feel is quad like in its thickness but a touch lighter and well carbonated with a gentle creaminess. A very deep and delightful brew. Much to enjoy and savor and I hope I find some more to cellar."
""
""
""
""
""
"This poured out as a nice looking deep brown color, the head was creamy looking and tan in color. The smell of the beer is sweet and a little yeasty. There are some slight dark fruit aromas in there too. The taste is a slight blend of the candi sugar, the fruits and the malts. No real noticeable bitterness in this one too much. The mouthfeel was smooth, gently carbonated and silky. Overall I thought this was a very nice release from Ommegang."
""
"Pours a deep amber to black in color with a big tan head. In the aroma, dark fruits and a sweeter roast. In the taste, dark fruits, a small dryness of alcohol, and a mix of small caramel and somewhat grape like. A boozy bite and a medium to lighter bodied mouthfeel, with a dry small alcohol and dark fruit, to a clean aftertaste. A bit boozy, fruity, caramel like, and Belgian like, almost feels like a quad."
"D: This was one of the sweeter Belgian dark ales I've had, with nice delicate scent and taste. The body was great, the alcohol was well hidden, and the finish was very mellow. So it was quite easy to drink, but sippable too. It could probably age quite well, but it was nice fresh also. Solid brew."
""
"O-This was just a mild and boring dark Belgian ale. Definitely doesn't deserved to be bottled. Not bad tasting though! And it does go down fairly easy."
""
""
""
"jd"
"O- I get the difference with this beer, but it just seems to be very similar to almost every other BSDA out there. Maybe it's just me... who knows?"
""
"O: This is an average BSDA and given its price point, I probably wouldn't be inclined to buy it again. If you like this style of beer though and you like Ommegang, then its worth checking out."
"Dark brown, mahogany highlights. Tan head, mild retention and some lace. Nose has dark fruits and grapes are dominant. Mildly sweet, almost floral in quality. Vanilla and cookie dough as well. Dark malt flavours, oats are evident, yeasty and dried fruits. Medium body, high effervescence. A really nice BSDA."
""
"Overall another interesting beer from Ommegang. Due to the price I'm glad it was a one time offer."
"Soapy head on thick dark brown body, with a lace sheet. yeasty aroma, I like their yeast. Smooth drinker, above average mouthfeel. Sweetish,and yet a little earthy, some malted milk, chocolate malt,touch of anise, not that complex still nicely drinkable."
""
"O: Overall this brew could have benefited from a little more body, otherwise it is very good."
""
""
""
""
"FEEL/IMPRESSION: Medium to full bodied, smooth, creamy and well carbonated. Overall I thought this was yet another very good offering from brewery Ommegang. Aging this in whiskey barrels is the next logical step."
""
"Overall - Pretty tasty and enjoyable. Kind of like a strong ale mixed with a porter. It takes a few drinks to get into this one for sure. Not something to drink weekly but for sure another quailty beer from ommegang. Price is steap but its worth a try."
"Deep pitch black body this is the Art of Darkness, okay we get it, there's also a light tan head forming thick, with Belgian inspired lacing. Aromatics offer up with dark cocoa, spicy aromatics inspired by the yeasts fermentation process. Dark malts give off a solid roasted malt aspect that I can relate to anyday, also a dark toasted nut quality coming out with the bier I'm sippin' on. Floral spicy yeast base, with dark roasted malts slightly creamy acidity almost yogurt like. Especially tasty dark beer, hybrid Belgian American dark ale, with even flowing carbonation and a medium bodied ale that I really enjoy. Overall impressive offering, that is tasty and satisfying for the beer drinker's palate."
""
"Overall - Other than the weak body this was a rather tasty beer. Good flavor profiles and transitions created a very nice taste experience."
""
""
""
""
"D - Very drinkable. Nicely balanced with a good depth of balance. Really nice blend of chocolate and dark fruit with the yeast character."
""
""

"Gets better and better as it warms. Nice complexity, with many layers of flavor for perusal. 4"
""
""
""
""
"Essentially it morphs from a well crafted smooth stout or porter into a wine right in your mouth, all through an array of complementary yet wildly varried flavors. It's magic!!!"
""
""
""
"But this one really does come close to impersonating a great Belgian strong dark ale. Kudos, Ommegang!"
"O: A refined and delicate Belgian Dark Strong Ale filled with dark fruits and a generous heaping of funk. Very easy drinking at 8.9%."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pretty good. I've had a lot better from this brewery and this is nowhere near the finest examples of the style...but pretty good. I wish it was tamer with the phenolics and little more cohesive with all its tasty little elements."
""
""
"This one poured an opaque black, w/ a thin-ish white head that stuck around a long time. Roasty aroma and flavor of a really thick porter. The mouth feel of a chewy stout. Rather disappointingly low in sweetness and fairly one-dimensional. Easy to drink, that's for sure. But I was expecting more."
""
""
"2.5 D: This is more of a Belgian stout than a BSDA, but whatever. It's overly roasty and unbalanced and that's no good. I expect more from Ommegang."
""
""
"Overall: Not as balanced as it could be, but very tasty. I like the medicinal characteristics in particular. Somewhat different than other Ommegang beers, but not in a bad way!"
""
""
"Art of Darkness pours a black color, with a a large creamy head, that stubbornly wont go away. The smell is enticing, its sweet, with Belgian candies, but has a dark undertone, smokey, malty, bitter and boozy. The taste starts sweet, lots of belgian candy flavors, then a strong hit from the alcohol kicks in, and finishes with a malty finish. Nice strong taste, can sip on this one, and enjoy it. Overall a fantastic beer, complex and very enjoyable."
""
""
""
""
""
"I expect a mature strong beer to take advantage of the full yeast lifecycle not hide from it."
"VERY GOOD, WORTH GETTING!"
""
"Art of Darkness pours a solid black, with three plus fingers of light tan colored foam. Head retention is pretty good, and lacing is on the spotty side. The nose is very nice, with lots of plum, raisin, and fig. There's a little bit of roasty grains and clove-like phenols present in the background. The roast and phenols come way to the foreground in the flavor profile. That combination, present in that intensity, ends up coming off as a bit harsh/astringent. Sweet-ish dark fruits are still present, but somewhat drowned out by the other aspects of the flavor profile. The body has just a touch too much heft, but it's paired with a very active, expressive carbonation. Art of Darkness seemed promising at first, but just missed the mark for being a great take on a Belgian Strong Dark Ale. It's the latest in what's been a string of very ""meh"" beers for me from Ommegang."
"o: decent offering from Ommegang. one of those which I'm glad I tried but not likely to seek out again. thought the aroma was better than the taste. worth a try."
"An alright Belgian Dark, perhaps too young to sample. To me this bottle looks to be a year or 2 from optimum. The last few beers from Ommegang haven't really wowed me. Pretty good, not great"
"Very good beer."
"Overall: Superb, and a blessing to have the ""darkness"". Rich beer and worth every penny. Definitely need to treat yourself, Salud!"
"O: do yourself a favor and pick the up. Very complex, tasty and improves as it warms. All kinds of different nuances come through in time. Well done by Ommegang."
""
"O: Does not blow palate away in flavor, yet is quite enjoyable. Going out on a limb and comparing it to a Scottish Ale with Belgian yeast."
""
"Overall, this was a very well made beer. If you run across a bottle, then I recommend picking this up."
""
""
" Ommegang can, and get, done better. Buy Ommegang, the breweries namesake beer, if you want anything like this."
""
"Pours a deep, opaque, brownish sable with a very thick and somewhat persistent light tan head. The sample I got fizzed quite a bit, so I recommend having a towel handy when you crack open a bottle. Aroma has notes of caramel and molasses plus hints of licorice and pear. Superb flavor has a malty core and fruity, caramel and molasses tones, hints of horehound, licorice and honey. Smooth, firm-bodied texture does not have a lot of fizz, but it still pleases. Let this ""dark side"" seduce you while you have the opportunity."
""
""
"High C+"
""
"Better in the bottle than draft. Really needed to breathe before I appreciated it fully."
""
""
"O: I thought this would be a belgian stout but there is only just a hint of roasted malt in this one. Very fruity and sharp with spice. Well balanced. Carbonation a touch high but not unusually so."
""
"Served in a mini-snifter, a dark brown nearly black beer, with a small cap of eggshell head; not much retention, but it did leave some nice soapy lacing while it lasted. Roasty malt aroma, dark sugars, a bit of dark fruit, bready. Taste is woody, malty, pumpernickel, caramel, with notes of figs, prunes, and licorice. Mouthfeel was about medium, would've been thin for a porter, but about right for a strong ale. Pretty nice overall, but nothing that I'd go out of my way for."
"I thought this was a pretty nice beer from the folks at Ommegang."
""
""
""
"Overall: malt heavy beer for the genre. Glad I tried this one, nice and unique"
"The beer pours a very dark brown to black color with a tan head. The aroma is has some roasted malt, as well as some dark fruit, chocolate and Belgian yeast notes. The flavor is similar, with the chocolate and dark fruit notes going very well with the yeast and roasted malt notes. Tastes a lot like a Belgian imperial stout. Medium to thick mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"Poured from a bottle into a snifter, the beer pours an extremely dark brown into black coloring with a light, frothy, half an inch of foamy head on the pour that settles into a sparse filmy coating. Aromas are effervescent and very well blended, with a roasted grain backbone, earthy notes, some smokey highlights, and a light sweetness throughout. Flavors are equally dynamic, with a smoked and roasted sugary caramel backbone, hints of blackstrap molasses throughout, bitter coffee characteristics, and a dry hopping at the end that cleans the palate. Very well layered and blended flavor profile. The more you drink, the more reveals itself to you, with highlights of cocoa nib, fig, date, and more as you go. Tasty beer. The aftertaste is minimal thanks to the hops presence, with a touch of tangy caramel and booze. The finish is clean and quick. This is a beer that is heavy on flavor while light in mouth. Good brew."

"Overall: Interesting fruit flavors with a touch of tartness; a beer with a difference"

"overall an interesting beer, not sure if I would pay that much for it again, but at least a nice one to try. Decent malts, hops are a bit too far away on teh back end though, booze is about right, nice carbonation and body, decent all around beer."

"OVerall: I think they did a good job of what they set out to do. I would have another, but I don't think I'd spend the money on a whole bottle."
""
"O: There was nothing really complex here, but just good old fashioned Belgian ale brewing. Really good stuff, and at a great price!"
"750ml corked and caged bottle served in a Tank 7 tulip. Poured a dark brown with some reddish hints. Big tan head, lots of carbonation in this one. Yeast spice in the aroma with a little dark malt. Belgian yeast spice predominated in the flavor. Some chocolate malt and a little dark fruit. Medium bodied. The spice was a little to over the top for me."

"O - the sour aspects diminish the beer for me, though I can still appreciate the craftsmanship, the usual complex, quality beer from this brewery even if it did not hit my sweet spot"

"Bottle in an Ommegang chalice. This is a deep translucent brown color with an inch of foam. Smell has a lot of wine characteristics, led by some grape, cherry, and bubblegum. There are some other mild spices like cloves present. The taste is sweet with a lot of grapes, banana, and nuts. Alcohol is masked very well. Mouthfeel is fairly thin and fizzy."
"Where the Art of Darkness doesn't portray the breadth, earthy boldness, or assertive complex sweetness as many darker strong Belgian ales, it's relies on a simplified palate that's exquisitely balanced, more yeast-neutral, and somewhat subdued to celebrate its shear drinkability in understated fashion."
"O: not overly impressed here, I expected a richer, more full bodied almost stout like here... And that it was not.... Perhaps this would be better with some age if the yeast were to mellow out. A decent brew and worth tryin.... But I don't see myself going back for seconds."
"I love Ommegang almost anything, and will try every brew of theirs, this was a great brew. I love it because it had those same flavors of my Ommegang brew (abbey ale), but those flavors were very mild; the rest of the beer is big and bold. I love the appearance because it looks like a slightly watered down cup of black coffee with a lot of head on it. Plus, who doesn't like a liberal beer? Bravo!"
"Served from tap into Trappe Door tulip. Poured a massively dark reddish brown with a two finger light khaki colored head that subsided to a minimal amount very slowly. Maintained phenomenal lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, dark fruit, bread, earth, and sweet alcohol. The flavor was of sweet amlt, dark fruit, bread, earth, and very subtle sweet alcohol. It had a medium feel on the palate with mild carbonation. Overall this was a fairly decent brew. While the flavor and aroma on this one was fairly complex, it just left a little to be desired if I am completely honest. All of the right aspects for the style were definitely present, but I just wish they would have come across a little more balanced. Worth trying if you get the chance though."

"Had never heard of this, but I rather enjoyed it. I didn't care too much for Seduction, but this was a treat."
""
"D - Good to try."
"O: A very solid effort, not the best I've had from Ommegang, but well made for sure. Just hoping the bottles aren't over $10, otherwise it'd be a good QPR."

"O- Get it while you can, simply a brew not to be missed."
"O: A very well made, drinkable beer."

"O: balanced and complex - somewhere between an imperial stout, a strong Belgian ale, and a black ale; I imagine this beer will acquire more mellowness and sweetness with age"
"A great beer that I may up my ratings on. So what complements this new monster addition to the Ommegang lineup? Well a perfect addition on a northern winter night in a craftsman home with a fireplace blazing while listening to Cecil Taylor percussive style piano with Jimmy Lyons saxophone player blazing next to him. I recommend the angry recording made in Germany ""One More Salty Swift and Not Goodbye."""

"O - My favorite Ommegang in a while, which says a lot because I dig all the beers they do. Highly recommended, should be releasing to retail very soon."
