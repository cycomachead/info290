"Overall this is an exceptional beet and extremely enjoyable. I highly recommend it as it is a beer-gasm ina bottle."
"Smak delikatnie alkoholowy, bardzo przyjemny, goryczka wyraźna, również sympatyczna. W smaku dominują śliwki i przyprawy. Z czasem alkohol staje się bardziej intensywny, nie odrzuca. Całość bardzo dobrze skomponowana, piwo rewelacyjnie ""pijalne"". Bardzo polecam."
"Strong, boozy, and definitely not your session beer. But the strong scent of raisins and alcohol plays nicely on the tongue and the nose. Definitely worth a try for any fan of the darker stuff."
""
"just try it. Reminds me of Westvleteren 12."
""
""
""
"Dy yeasty tang for the finish, with a burn of alcohol. Crazy stuff. A great Christmas beer-- it's a gift of the Magi! [From notes: Dec. 29, 2014 tasting]"
"Pretty good, dark cloudy look, smooth"
""
""
""
""
"An unmistakeable Belgian fruity sweetness rises from this dark brown and crimson brew.  Tastes soft with notes of currant and grain quickly enveloped by various other dark fruits and warming alcohol.  Simple and brilliant."
"This one was recommended to me from all over and I can't say I understand why. The description for this style on this site says that it can be ""very bold and in your face"" which is definitely true here. It's just that, in my opinion, it's true to a fault."
""
""
""
"Dark, malty, smooth with a bit of carbonation, not heavy."
""
""
""
""
"Bold with a nice start and finish. Leaves tastebuds highly engaged. The thyme gives a unique flavor."
""
""
"Poured a clear brown with an impressive bubbly head. It dissipated to a thin off white ring like lace which retained until about 3/4 through the drink, after which it mostly disappeared. The aroma was my favorite. I first detected brown sugar, followed by chocolate malt, dry fruit and earthy and grassy yeast like aromas. The taste was malty sweet, fruity, spicy, and malty. Most evident was a boozy finish that was dry and felt like a rum and coke. For me the boozy element was a bit too much, which detracted slightly from the other flavors. For this reason I downgraded the taste. The feel was full bodied but mostly drinkable. A low carbonation that nevertheless stings the tongue."
""
""
"A spicy nose carries an array of pitted fruit aromas and sweet malts and yeasty esters. It pours deep brilliant amber bordering on brown under a 2” ligntly amber tinted off-white foam cap with a very fine bead. The cap gradually collapses as the bubble gradually grow and collapse, leaving gothic lace patterns on the glass.  Its spicy with a fruity malty sweetness that stops short of cloying. As it warms cherry and plum with a hint of bubble gum become more distinct and prominent with light ginger, cinnamon and a hint of anise coming into focus. The brewer has lightened the body to somewhere around medium so it drinks a lot less hefty than many 10.0% abv beers. The above average carbonation also softens this big beer. The alcohol is smooth and not hot and shows its presence with a gentle warming. An excellent choice for sitting by the fire and relaxing."

"Overall, a fairly good Belgian Strong Dark Ale. I'll probably pick this up again next winter and definitely recommend this."
""
""
""
""
"A lot of earthy yeast is prevalent with a lingering hay flavor, almost like a dark saison, mixed with some faint fruit / coriander and caramel.  Good balance and mouthfeel, but I feel it lacks a standout feature, solid all around though."
"Overall:  This is another great Belgian strong dark ale!  Great flavors of fruit and malt, balanced with some subtle, pleasant sour cherry.  Delicious!"
""
""
"A very enjoyable beer.  The bottle indicates it has potential for aging.  I might try that some day.  I think this is an offering you might be able to use to introduce people to the style with its light feel and mild alcohol bite."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I say grab it if you see it, it's a gem. I picked up a four pack and will have my second without regret. Salud!"

"O: I can’t believe it had 10% abv, didn’t stray from the La Chouffe prototype, a winner, thumbs up from me."
"O- A nice sipper for sure with lots of dark fruit and each element nicely balanced."
""
""
""
"Solid Belgian"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A real treat. Perfect sustitute for dessert, or an accompanyment."
""
""
""
""
"Not in the league of the top-tiered Belgian quads, but might be on the level of a fresh Chimay Blue. A little too Belgian candy cane flavor for me, but definitely respect the fact that the heat is much subdued than the actual abv it packs. Overall, a good BSDA, especially during the winter and at this price point ($4.50/bottle)."
""
""
""
""
"O: A really nice BSDA with some unusual wintery spices (not your typical cinnamon and/or nutmeg) but it works. Really nice candi sugar flavor, really clean and crisp. Perfect for today (temperature did not go above freezing all day). Clean mouthfeel lends to superior drinkability."
""
""
""
"Outstanding"
""
""
""
"I liked this, but would have liked it more if the peppery yeast esters didn't leave such a spicy dryness to it all. Maybe aged a year or two this mellows favorably, yet the label states best BEFORE 6/2016? Also, the alcohol punched through more than I like. Despite that, this was still a solid sipper that's ripe for the holidays (it's a bit early but who's counting)."
""
""
""
""
"O: A very uneven beer to say the least. Has some good qualities, but is lacking in the flavor department."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Sweet spices, chocolate, malt, pepper, going together very well. Interessting for La Chouffe, reminds me of the typical belgium witbier, this one is very dark, with intense malts till the very end. Taste doesn’t linger too long, carbonation leads to a well balanced taste. Nice fruity, spicy brown character, with a complex but not overwhelming taste."
"Really nice beer. Subtle sweetness and great malty body. The high alcohol is well masked which I appreciate with this style."

"N'Ice Chouffe - Brasserie d'Achouffe This Belgian Strong Dark Ale Winter Warmer smells like Malt Balls, Dark fruit, Jesus and baking bread... Very enticing~ Head lacing is infinite ... Pours a dynamic Mahogany, Purple/Brown with LOADS of floating Ingredients and a sandy bottom~ Mouthful is very rich, Creamy, yet light in density and not in the least sticky nor did it linger, leaves your palate very pleased and wanting more!~ Heavy Malt, Cinnamon, Orange Peel, Toast, Citrus, Grape/Plum, Brown Sugar, Raisin, a touch Peppery, Thyme and Curaçao Peel, Dark Candy, light Cherry, a bit of banana, just a bit of a woody taste and very much Berry~ Delicious refreshing and warms the soul! I just took another pic of the head lacing... It's literally by FAR the best I've ever seen! Thick and coats almost the whole glass~ Very pleased with this interesting, unique and complex authentic product of Belgium~ Covered the 10%ABV very well on my 2010 edition~ Hope I can find this again~ Overall 97"

"It's an excellent beer, but I am looking for more sweetness, and an aroma which is stronger."
""
""
"Another Chouffe masterpiece. This is probably my new favorite of their offerings. This beer is so smooth it's almost impossible to believe the 10% ABV. So glad I finally got to try this, and I can't wait to see what some time in the cellar does for a couple bottles."

"750 ml bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 8/24/2012. Pours lightly hazy/cloudy deep ruby red color with a 1-2 finger fairly dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of big raisin, plum, cherry, fig, apple, orange peel, caramel, toast, dark candi sugar, clove, molasses, brown bread, herbal, light pepper, and yeast earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of fruity/spicy yeast ester and dark/bready malt notes; with good strength. Taste of big raisin, plum, cherry, fig, apple, orange peel, caramel, toast, dark candi sugar, molasses, brown bread, clove, herbal, light pepper, and yeast earthiness. Lingering notes of raisin, plum, cherry, fig, apple, orange peel, caramel, toast, dark candi sugar, clove, molasses, brown bread, herbal, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a while. Damn nice complexity and big robustness of dark/bready malt and fruity/spicy yeast ester flavors; with a great malt/yeast flavor balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a moderately slick, smooth, and lightly syrupy mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent Belgian strong dark ale. All around great balance, robustness, and complexity of dark/bready malt and fruity/spicy yeast ester flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the big ABV. A very enjoyable offering."
"Overall – The flavour is kind of subdued, but it's good in a way because it isn't cloyingly sweet like some other belgian darks are. A solid brew."
""
""
""
"O: I really enjoyed N'Ice Chouffe -- an exceptional mix of sweetness and yeast esters with just the right level of bitterness and a light body to provide a great balanced BSDA. I wish it had a little more complexity, but what it brings is very delicious."
""
""
""
""
""
"Bottle brought by Beastmaster. Pours a deep dark red that looks beautiful in the light with a large fluffy off white head. However, there are giant chunks of yeast in this one and boy is it ugly. Aroma of sweet dark fruits: plums, cherries, spicy funky yeast. Flavor is rather syrupy sweet with big dark cherries and plums, some brief spice, and lots of candy sugar. Medium heavy mouthfeel with low carbonation. Meh, this wasn't all that great."
""
""
""
"The orange peel is a great addition. Nice sipping beer for the winter time."
""
"O- Easy drinking for a strong, and the thyme gives this thing some depth."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall – This one was a very enjoyable and dangerously good and easy to drink Belgian dark winter ale. Very tasty."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall- Solid, good beer which remains true to the style while making some departures. I would definitely give it a try. Sort of average for a BDSA but enjoyable nonetheless."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Not a bad Christmas beer, but still there are a few off notes. Not so bad as to keep away from, but not in my top ten."
""
""
""
""
"Would have again; worth trying if you can."
"Very enjoyable winter sipper. Has held up very well over past couple years. Warms you up while relaxing by the fire. Really hits its stride as it warms up some."
""
""
""
""
"Great winter sipping beer, but hides its 10% ABV rather dangerously. Similiar texture to a rocheford 10, but a good deal sweeter."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, taste and smell are the best components, and that's what matters. This beer is a great holiday and winter sipper."

"My prior review was L=4, A=4, T=4, MF=4, D=3.5. New review rated to todays beer, which is much better. I would buy this again!"
""
""
""
""
"A beautiful ruby beer with a rocky tan/beige 2"" head. Steady stream of bubbles. Smells pretty rough. Pennies, musty, and caramel. Some orange hidden under the metallic musty copper. Taste is thankfully far from the aroma. Caramel, thyme, must, orange peel definitely comes through. Big fluffy carbonation, sweet toffee finish. Overall a very nice spiced BSDA."
""
""
""
"Like most from Achouffe excellent."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A nice surprise to be found in Shanghai, but this would be a welcome sight anywhere. Refreshing but also very powerful. A good one to kick back with."

"I love the standard La Chouffe and I only wish this one was as readily available for home consumption too. The brewery is too far away from Australia!!!"
"The taste is quite delightful with its solid Belgian malt and sugar sweetness, well-integrated alcohol for 10% ABV, and a spicy, pungent and dryish finale. Except for the nose it was an overall enjoyable beer and I would like another."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Classic seasonal beer, perfect for wintertime."
""
""
""
""
"Overall this is a fine beer. I curious on how it will taste with some aging as I feel there's some good balance going on already. Definitely keeping one in the cellar and popping it after a couple years."

"O - Incredibly smooth, ABV is non-existent and the flavour profile is incredibly well presented. Nicely balanced and insanely drinkable at 10%. A fantastic brew that aged incredibly well and I am definitely glad I had the opportunity to try it. Thanks Joe!"

"Pours a five finger khaki head that fades slowly leaving some lace. Hazy amber/brown color. Medium carbonation and medium bodied. Light cinnamon and malty nose, flavor is dark fruit and cinnamon, warming but higher ABV is hidden. 750ml green bottle, gift, from Madden Beverage."
"Big bottle and a big glass. I'm in heaven. The appearance is reddish brown with a quickly dissipating cream colored head. The smell is sour cherries, oak, and honey. I could build a room in that smell and live in it. The taste is chocolate, licorice, and wood. Unfortunately, licorice and I are not on speaking terms. Mouthfeel is slick, nice. Overall its interesting. It has a very pronounced flavor. I'm not sure about this one but I'm not sorry I tried it."
""
""
""
""
"O - An excellent, although expensive ($28 for 750) beer. I made a good choice because my friend had already told the bartender (without me knowing) to put my first beer on his tab. :)"
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A nice winter beer. Thought it would be more overpowering, but it's a seemingly low-key belgian beer with nice subtle characteristics. Would definitely welcome another of these again."
""
""
"To the Point: I really like this ale. Top shelf stuff here. I’ll have to plan to have this in stock next year for the holidays. Hope I remember!"
""
""
""
""
"Beer is medium-heavy in body, with carbonation of medium intensity. The result is a mouthfeel that foams slightly as it moves across the palate, but never feels prickly or fizzy. Closes semi-dry, with moderate stickiness remaining across the palate."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, pretty good but not something to seek out. I am glad that the spicing is not too heavy but the other flavours are not particularly big."
""
""
""
"Not bad but a little too much yeast dominance for my tastes."
""
"O: A fantastic choice for the first beer to start off a new year. Great flavors and well balanced. The thyme and curaçao are an interesting addition that create a smooth mellow drinking ale. Easy drinking and delicious. Highly recommend. Cheers!"
""
""
"Good Belgian ale but would prefer a bit more malt and a bit less alcohol"
"O: Excellent drinkability. Excellent BSDA which is very close to a Quad. Not recommended: mandatory! :)"
""

"750 ml bottle, 2011 vintage (I know I've had the bottle at least a year), back label says best before end 2013. Served in a goblet, the beer pours a hazy reddish/copper color with a half inch off-white head. Head retention is good, and there's a decent amount of lacing. The brew smells like sweet spices, candi sugar, oranges, dark fruit, and some caramel. It tastes like sweet spices, thyme, candi sugar, dark fruit, molasses, caramel, and a bit of peppery spice. Mouthfeel/body is medium/full, it's creamy and has moderate carbonation. I think it's a good overall brew. At $11.99 a bottle, I'd try this again in the future."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a darker brown with maybe a hint of amber. Head is ivory cores and easily a finger or two - a brief swirl excites it again. Good lacing and head retention around the rim. Smells spicy and sour style (it's not) - the latter maybe from citrus/orange/curaçao. Taste is sweet yet depth of flavor - good malt balance and Belgian candy sugar to sweeten."
""
""
"Christmas beer has arrived! What a pleasure. In a boring, distracted and sometimes depressing world, here comes Achouffe with a pep-me-up. Spicy and N'Ice perfect timing for an excellent brew, and with it's annual limited production this Limited Edition makes me smile. High ABV ales are tricky, often just a slight ""too much"" alcohol or a flatness which is often the result, then toss in some thyme and curacao peel and you get a potentially volatile disappointment, not this one. So well balanced for what I call an exotic beer! Pours a hearty bold amber, good and stable head, pleasant smell, and clean finishing taste. Like I said, this one will make you smile, good seasonal beer."
""
""
"O- A very nice winter beer, it's actually pretty refreshing to drink despite being so spicy and having 10% ABV, but it's also a nice sipper, worth picking up around this time of year."
""
""
"D - I have this one every once in awhile... surprised I never reviewed it before. A solid offering."
""
""
"O: Overall I thought it was pretty good but it seemed rather average for a Stong Dark. I really like the Achouffe beers, but I can't say that I picked up any of the special ingredients added to this beer. It is a good beer, but not anything more special than another Belgian. I can't say that the price tag validates the quality of the beer."
""
""
"Not majorly impressive. Still something that I order when it's on-tap. 3.5"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - this had a 'best before' that past nearly 16 months ago and I think this has definitely mellowed out with that little bit of aging, the alcohol is nearly undetectable and the smooth fruitiness really holds it down, a fine holiday treat for sure"
""
""
"This beer is very good but begs to be paired with rich flavored foods. On it's own I probably wouldn't enjoy it but luckily i have some nice turkey stuffing and gravy to go with it. Very concise flavors, super complex, but in order for them all to work, this beer needs food."
"O: Definitely an enjoyable brew. I'll need to add this into my Christmas beer rotation."
""
""
""
"O: There are handfuls of better Christmas ales out there. Ask Santa for a better gift."
"Overall - A excellent holiday sipper. Complex flavors along wit balance make this a winner. Another holiday beer to add to my list to enjoy annually. Drink this for sure."
"Bottle. Poured reddish brown color with an average frothy head that lasted with good lacing. Complex dark fruit and yeasty aroma. Medium body with a smooth texture. Medium fruity sweet flavor with a medium sweet finish of long duration with a small alcohol bite. This is a good beer"

"O- Very nice. Smooth, clean, oxidation was minimal. The carbonation was great, maybe even more pronounced then I would prefer and then I need to factor in the age of this beer. Damn. This could have sat in my cellar of a longer amount of time. I almost wish I had left it in there. Easily could have hit the 10 year mark."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Really good Belgian Dark from a great brewery."
"Smooth body feel, alcohol just about hidden and overall a very N'ice beer."
""
""
""
"M: Big but very flavorful. The spices are smooth, the yeast strain imparting plenty of sweet flavors. A rather unexpected but nice find."
""
""
""
""
""
"I have to say, one of the best holiday beers I have tried. Very drinkable, the alcohol is very well hidden, just a touch of warming at the finish. I am drinking this in May, but on a chilly December night, I can't think of a better beer to try. Also quite good any time of year."
""
""
"Very strong brew from D'Achouffe- would love to have this on hand during the holidays!"
"O - very nice beer. The time in the bottle seems to have worked well for it. This beer could have easily aged for longer. Plenty of carbonation and flavors still around."
""
""
""
"This was an OK offering. I enjoyed it but also wouldn’t see myself buying another. It paired well enough with a platter of cheese salami, honey, and hummus."
"The entire experience is accentuated by a rich and chewy mouthfeel, supporting the palate's nuances and fruit-sweet aspects. Ample carbonation keeps the palate clean between sips, making this go down dangerously fast. One of my go-to brews of this style, a great brew to endure cold winter nights, or any time you're in the mood for a tasty sipper."
""
"Overall: I'm liking the N'ice Chouffe. From the first time I had the McChouffe back in Amsterdam, this brewery has been a favourite. For an afternoon after a long weekend of skiing in Jasper, AB, this beer is a warm treat. I would definitely buy this again."
""
"Never again unless in Belgium and desire fruity beer that packs punch"
""
""
""
"Overall a very decent BSDA, does not taste like 10% at all, nice spices and fruits"
"O- The herbal and citrus blend has some interesting cidery flavors to it but it covers up a bit of the dark candy notes which are nice. As the beer opens up the flavors meld together more and more."
"Great beer! I usually get a little shy around green bottles but I had to try it. Nice aroma of spice and dark fruit, a bit flat but I have read that this beer tends to do that after time. Has a wonderful taste of spices and those dark fruit notes really do come out. Nice and smooth finish leaves you wanting more."
""
""
"Excellent for any occasion where a sipping beer is appropriate. N’Ice Chouffe hits on all levels and continuously presents new layers and characteristics. This sample came from a vintage 2008 bottle and was served in a La Chouffe tulip glass."
""
"Overall: This Belgian Christmas Ale is spiced with with thyme and curaçao. La Chouffe usually make pretty good stuff, even if nothing mind blowing. This one was enjoyable, I shared the 0.75l bottle with a friend. Nothing particularly memorable about it — the spices are not evident and it mostly just tastes like a decent Belgian Strong Ale — but certainly worth trying."
"Drinkability is great, like this beer. I prefer it from the bottle though, with some age, to round out and grab a little depth. Still, a true world classic...I can't believe I haven't reviewed this before!"
"Still I do appreciate the opportunity to have had this on tap."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: The spices add an interesting twist to the style and make it a good beer to sip."
"O: Very enjoyable and the taste of alcohol is nicely hidden in this beer - a good beer to enjoy over the holiday/winter season and seems like it would pair nicely with traditional American Thansgiving & Christmas dinners."
""
"Overall this was pretty good. I thought the alcohol was well hidden for 10%. Very winter like and well suited for a Christmas release."
""
""
""
""
"O: Overall a well balanced beer with a great deal of flavors and definitly drink this one again."
"Overall, I love this beer. No major flaws. Easy to drink. Hides the alcohol well. Wish it wasn't a seasonal beer."
""
""
"The fluid has a colour like cola and it has a light sweetness over it. VERY drinkable, that is the biggest advantage of this beer. Even non beerdrinkers will like this type of beer."
"Great flavor with spices and malts leading the way. Not my personal favorite, but hopefully my review is impartial enough to indicate the complexity and fine brewing skill involved in the creation of the N'Ice Chouffe. A fine effort."
""
""
""
"Overall Impression- There are only two times I go from reviewing a brew on-tap and wanting it in the bottle as well. Firstly, if I feel the beer wasn't in the best condition (whether tap line or keg problems), and the other is it was an A+ beer. This one met the second criteria! Would recommend anyone trying this one. Could never be bored with one of these in front of me."
""
""
"O-i just simply do not like my beers to be so hot, i also like my belgians to have a good amount of carbonation to it. those two aspects made this beer difficult to finish for me and its something i'll be avoiding from now on."
""
"This beer tastes a lot like it does when fresh, I am surprised their hasn't been more of a change. Would love to cellar this for 5 years or more and see if there is more of a change."
""
""
""
"O: A beautiful and complex Belgian Strong Dark Ale, and my favorite so far from this brewery."
""
"O: I'm quite impressed. Very complex and easy drinking. Dark fruit notes are exceptional. Banana and chocolate are also fairly strong. Overall a great BSDA."
""
"O - It's not a bad Christmas ale, but there are nicer ones out there.This one doesn't blow me of my socks."
"Overall tasty, a staple for Belgian Xmas beer, great malts and fruit flavors, hints of esters and some booze, light spices, drinkable and tasty."
"This is a nice BSDA and one that I enjoyed. The addition of thyme helps cut through the overall sweetness and lends a welcome drying characteristic."
""
"Single finger head on a cloudy amber body. Lots of lacing. This is a fairly thick beer. Aroma is mostly light on the dark fruit with some fig and juniper. Overall aroma is light. Flavor is a semi sweet dark fruit however this is light. It is a little watered down. Medium in body and moderate to high carbonation. Overall not in my tops for Belgian dark strongs."
""
"N'Ice Chouffe is an easy ale to recommend. Whether or not it'll make my want list next year remains to be seen, but I'd gladly welcome a bottle in my stocking any time. The Belgians, like the French, know as much about drink as they do food, and, good Catholics they are, they obviously know a thing or two about celebrating Christmas too!"
""
"O - A very interesting Winter beer, I love the herbal character added from the thyme. I do wish I had consumed this about a year earlier, though."
"Overall, this beer was a true delight. It was delicious. It also pared perfectly with the pizza. I highly recommend it."
"Feels a little thin for the complexity of the taste and aroma. It has a creamy taste but the actual consistency doesn't match. Though the 10% abv is deceptive. Seems too light for the abv."
""
""
""
"Updated review w/ 2010 Pulled from 4 year home in  back of cellar for 2014."
"O: Heavy, fruity, and spicy, this beer offers an excellent warmth for the winter. It is certainly a beer to have more as a desert, and to sip, rather than to drink a lot of in one sitting. It is the type of beer that truly does seem special and meant for the holidays."
""
"O- very tasty, great fruit and spice and yeast profile in a smooth drinking winter srong dark ale"
"O - This is a nice Belgian Dark Strong, I thought it may be a bit too spicy but I didn't feel that was the case, just a nice complex flavor profile. A worthy limited edition from Brasserie d'Achouffe."
""
""
""
""
""
"nice belgian take on a winter beer. pours dark berry red with a rising and lasting 3 inch head in a tulip glass. smells belgian yeasty and of sour cherries, possible candy sugar, but this isnt a sweet aroma, just complex. taste has definitive notes of cherries, fresh ones, and a sturdy malt spine. mouthfeel is belgian magic, smooth, not too heavy, and well carbonated. ten dollars for a small pour, but the flavor is worth it. unique winter brew and excellent with some live grateful dead cover tunes!"
"O - This was a very nice tasting Belgian. The aroma had some issues but it delivered a great taste."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a really good Belgian dark ale and probably one of the best Christmas seasonal beers I've had."
"Pours a hazy dark brown with a 1/2 inch tan head that fades to nothing. No lacing on this beer. Smell is of malt, dark fruits (plums, prunes), and some mild spice aromas. Taste is of malt, the dark fruits, and a nice balance of spices. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp and clean mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good BSDA with some very nice flavors going on."
"Pours a mostly clear orange-tinted dark red with two fingers of dense tan colored foam. Slowly settles to a half inch and leaves a sheet of thick sticky lace down the glass. Smell: dark brown sugar, muted toasted raisin bread. Slightly herbal but not distinctly thyme; no orange peel here. Taste: candi sugar, toffee, herbal and somewhat spicy, red grape skin, bitter orange, heavily toasted raisin bread. Tannin heavy finish overwhelms prior creamy feel. Otherwise pretty good. 2011 version (as far as I can tell from the bottling code)."

"Had it on tap at Vintners. Excellent Belgian strong dark ale. Nice head that dissipated quickly. Great dark reddish brown color. Taste notes of spice and malt, fairly sweet. I thought that it masked the alcohol pretty well for a 10% beer. Overall a great beer that I look forward to having again soon."
"N'Ice la Chouffe is a murky brown ale with a soft, smooth khaki head that fades to a film and leaves decent lacing on the glass. Crumbles accumulate in the bottom of the glass. Aroma of alcohol, candied fruit, apple, cherry, nectarine, tobacco and hay. It's pretty full bodied and quite smooth with pretty dry finish. It's richly flavored and just a touch sweet. It's pretty complex with notes of peach, must, tropical fruit, leather, tobacco, cider, phenol and, later on, chocolate and fortified wine. It's a touch bitter at the end and quite warming. This is a pretty classy affair. It's a big bottle, so make sure you share. Very enjoyable; it's kind of a flavor adventure."

"Drinkability : a nice beer in the style Belgian strong dark ale."

"O: This is categorized as a ""Belgian Strong Dark Ale"" which is appropriate considering that this is strong, the color is dark, and it was imported from Belgium. However, this is one of the least Belgian-funk infused beers I've ever tasted. In fact, it's one of the best ""Winter Warmers"" to ever hit my palate..."

"Pours a dark brown w/ a nice one finger cocoa head. Excellent lacing on my snifter glass. Very murky and dirty looking- like the bottom of a river bed. The nose of this brew is really nice. Dark fruit, citrus fruit, yeast, spices- and none of the 10% alcohol... Not really sure where they hid it. Taste is interesting- I get a lot of spice (thyme?) at first along w/ yeast. It's super dry though, so that goes away and dissolves into acidity and a nice fruit aftertaste... I like it- but not quite enough to bump it to the next level. Feel is very dry and acidic. Overall, this is a good beer- but it's in a tough style category. Still, I'd buy this again. Cheers."

"Overall I enjoy this beer. Another strong offering from D'Achouffe. Good brewery."
"Good Belgian strong dark, but light on fruit and heavier on spice... curious. More versatile with food (steak, lamb, pasta alfredo), probably."
"I may get another bottle just to keep until summer. I can see why it would be seasonal as it might wear you down if had too often."
"Overall just not feeling this beer here, this is just not doing it for me, and its label description gives it NO justice whatsoever. Drinkability though even for the high abv is easy however."
"Dr: It hides its high ABV very well, and is built to style, but there's room for improvement. I'd try it on draught, but otherwise there's nothing special here."
"Randomly found a 2008 vintage at my local haunt, so I figured I'd give it a go. It pours a hazy dark auburn-amber topped by a finger of dirty white foam. The nose comprises dark wheat, coriander, light mandarin orange, white bread, clove, and light cardboard. The taste brings in more of the same, along with more bread, more orange, some light cocoa powder, some maple syrup, and more cardboard. Something tells me some oxidation had its way with the beer... The body is a hefty-feeling medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a grainy feel. Overall, I think this was past its prime (despite what the ""best by"" date may tell me to the contrary), as it tasted fairly oxidized and felt like it had lost a step or two in the carbonation and texture areas."
"Taste: all the spices and fruits I found in the smell come through perfectly in the taste. Starts off with sweet citrus and malts then the spices make their way to the palate; dark fruits, berries, nutmeg, cinnamon, thyme and hops. Even though this is a 10% alc beer you can hardly notice the alcohol. This beer is like drinking a really good fruit cake. Very well done."
"Overall: Will mellow with age, fresh to sharp and alcoholic"
"O - Really nice and enjoyable. One of the better Belgian Christmas beers."
"This beer poured out as a deep amber color, the head was white and pretty strong looking. The lacing on the glass was pretty good too. The smell of the beer has a nice spicy Belgian aroma to it. The taste brings those spicy flavors onto the tongue along with a nice yeasty flavor and a touch of roasted nuts. The mouthfeel was pretty good, well carbonated and drinkable. Overall the beer is a nice wintery brew. Has some good warming qualities to it."
"Nevertheless, a worthwhile BSDA."
"Overall this is a very nice smooth, crisp Belgium Dark Ale."
"Getting close to its BB date so I'm assuming this one has a few years on and I would love to try it fresh just to see how different it is. Not cheap at 15$ a bottle but I'd buy it again"
"Maybe it's because this bottle is approaching its end-of-shelf-life (July 2011), but, good grief is this 10-pointer easy to drink! The fruity malt, yeast, thankfully understated spice, and especially the heady alcohol, are all so very laid back, providing something approaching the oblivious bliss horizon. A pleasantly surprising twist on the strong dark Belgian ale paradigm, and yes, n'ice - drum-roll/rim-shot, please!"
"O - Very sweet which hides abv well. I would definitely recommend it if you can get your hands on it."
"CHEERS"
"Wow! What a unique and tasty brew. Definetly a sipper due to the thickness and alcohol. A must try for beer enthusiasts looking for something different."
"D: It's a bit of a weird style, but drinkability is quite good if you like it. The finish has the nice quality of leaving you wanting more."
"This was a m'eh beer. I don't see myself buying this next year. Not as n'ice of a beer as I was led to believe."
"A well-spiced, dry and interestingly yeasty concoction. Very underrated brewery here, and this is one of their best offerings."
"Poured from 750ml bottle into a trappist glass. $17 for the bottle. Pours a clear, medium reddish-brown color; decent light tan head with good retention and solid, mixed-bubbled lacing. Soft raisin and cola notes dominate the aroma, followed up by a solid yeastiness, dates, and light spicing; the alcohol is very well-hidden in the nose; loads of dried dark fruits and restrained sweetness. Medium-to-full mouthfeel: good levels of carbonation; following the aroma, lots of dried dark fruits (raisins, dates), yeast, cloves, and white-pepper spiciness; a very restrained, intricate Belgian strong, although I wasn't completely taken in by the depths of the malt character; very upfront in its dark fruit character, some spice, but lacking an appropriate level of density at the core; very good, but not nearly as good as many of my favorite Belgian strong ales; still, careful in its presentation considering its youth; just a touch rough around the edges. Long finish: dried dark fruits, solid yeast and dough coming through; soft ending; very well-hidden alcohol throughout."
"A very nice, smooth and complex Belgian ale. Delicious and packed with flavour."
"D: Really drinkable. Pretty refreshing overall."
"Drinkable it is. Obviously strong, but it's got the right amount of bittersweetness that makes it a good experience."
"Most beautiful thing I have ever poured down my mouth. Caramel aftertaste after it goes down smooth. The beer gods have smiled upon you N'Ice Chouffe. How could the lord of the beer make this one any better? News flash, no way it could. Praise God for the sweet nectar of this one. The only thing that was rough was I jizzed in my pants on the first sip cause it was so amazing."
"I only wish I bought more so I could see how this stuff does with a few years of cellaring."
"I'd recommend one yes."
"Rich and full bodied with bold flavors of cherries, raisins and plums. Combinations of winter spices, curacao, thyme, tart fruits and a dark malt-backed sweetness make this seasonal warmer a complex masterpiece. Alcohol is barely perceptible. Unusually smooth and sessionable for something with 10% ABV. Great character. Highly recommended."
"Pours a rich dark brown with medium, thick head. Arome is mostly dried fruits with winter spices coming through such as nutmeg. Taste is dried fruits such as raisins and plums on the front end finishing with fairly strong yeasty hops. The beer is medium bodied with slight stronger carbonation. Virtually zero trace of alcohol in the flavor despite being 10% ABV."
"O- Amazing brew, so easy to drink, so enjoyable, so exotic. Wish there was another waiting for me. It aged incredibly. You won't believe this beer is as strong as it is... It's so complex and has such a nice yeast presence."
"Overall, well worth holding onto for a year, and no signs of oxidation at all in this bottle."
"The beer pours a deep brown and retained a thick foamy head throughout. The smell is very Belgian with its usual yeast, but it is toned down by a slight sweetness. The taste has a similar light sweetness that is well balanced by a more powerful yeast taste. The beer is well balances and finishes smooth without a hint of alcohol."
"d - A very nice Belgian dark ale with lots of spice and fruit. The taste was a bit sweeter than the nose, which I enjoyed. Would like to have again."
"Taste-Effervesent, brown sugar,Belgian spicy yeast, coarse hop note, orange peel. very complex and full of character, faint warming alcohol in the finish. Very well-balanced and flavorfull, every sip has a little different nuance. 10.0ABV is very well hidden. Enjoy with family and friends in front of a fire or Christmas tree."
"D/M: Good carbonation and very drinkable. Great balance and good flavors."
"D: A smooth ale. It shore takes some time to sip it."
"Beer is medium bodied and light on flavor in the front, it's slightly sweet but then I lose the beer on the palate some where. It's bland and plain, easy drinking especially considering the ABV, but I wanted more flavor."
"Even though there are a good amount of spices present, they do not overpower and kill the palate. Pretty drinkable beer. Definitely a nice warming beer to sip and savor."
"Drinkability: I thought this a nicely drinkable beer in that one sip followed another quite naturally and I'd certainly not hesitate to have a second. At this ABV its probably a one a night beer. That said, as a Christmas ale I'd opt for the Corsendonk over this one and if choosing a BSDA would prefer the Goulden Draak."
"Picked this up at an awesome beer store outside Ghent, Dranken Geers. Deep, dark mahogany pour with two finger head and nice lacing. Spicy, herbal nose with hints of dark fruit, cloves, brown bread, caramel and a touch of banana ester and candy. The taste is spicy and herbal as well. Lots of rasins and plums with hints of cinnamon, nutmeg, corriander and just a bit of banana and bitter orange peel. It really opens up as it warms and gets almost chewy. I was surprised how well the 10% ABV was hidden. It's a sipper and in a big bottle, but the drinkability was not bad at all. A classic winter/Christmas beer that I will return to next year."
"POured Cloudy dark with a smallish head that simmered down to film quickly. Smells and tastes of the Christmas spices you'd expect but heavier on the yeast and cloves and lighter on the nutmeg and cinamin. Medium bodied and a bit more carbonated than I woudl like but that can be rectified by letting it sit a minute, which is fine as I was drinking the 750 on my own with Xmas eve dinner. I was able to do this just fine, so drinkability is fine but I woudl have just had a 330ml bottle had I known it was just goign to be me drinking this bottle. The 10% was very well hidden, overall I like this and all Chouffe beers."
"D - A solid Belgian Strong Dark Ale, but not a world class one... Another solid offering from Brassiere D'Achouffe, but far from there best... I would never steer anyone away from trying this, but I believe there are many better examples of the style..."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: A medium bodied feel with a more-ish finish. This is my first D'Achouffe beer and it is certainly of a high quality. I am excited to try other beers from this brewery, the 10% alcohol is nowhere to be found and the simple flavors work well together here."
"N'Ice Chouffe pours a very deep brown, with just the faintest cherry outline when held directly to light. The bone colored head is somewhat muted, and while retention is OK lacing is nonexistent. The predominant flavors I'm getting in the nose are a semi sweet milk chocolate and a bit of orange, not a bad combination. The flavor does show some variety. On different sips I find notes of mild milk chocolate and sweet dark fruits up front. On the spice end the orange peel works really well, and the thyme melds together somewhat with a kick of clove from the yeast. All in all though the spice flavors tend to drown out the malty ones a bit too much, I feel like this beer's underattenuated. That concern carries across into the mouthfeel, where the body is surprisingly thin for a 10%ABV beer. This only accentuates what I feel is a carbonation level that is a bit too high. The somewhat fizzy nature does become distracting at times. The alcohol is fairly well hidden in this beer, but all in all there's not really anything to recommend it over plenty of other Belgians."
"D = Extremely drinkable and Dangerous, great for the cold day :)"
"O: I was really excited to find this on tap, however, a little disappointed. Solid beer but it falls short of their hopped up belgian IPA, houblon Chouffe."
"Pours a clean deep orange-ish color with a small off white head. In the aroma, cinnamon, nutmeg, coriander and caramel. In the taste, spicy, mostly cinnamon, and a caramel sweet to dry flavor. A spice bite and medium bodied mouthfeel, with a dry caramel and small spice in the aftertaste. Big spices and nice caramell notes, hides the ABV, and very nice."
"D - This is a delightful beer experience and I will seek out another. This brasserie does not produce any sub standard beers."
"Notes: While I've never been too big a fan of their standard Chouffe the rest of their releases confirm that these are topnotch brews. Quite a treat."
"D: This is a great sipper by the fire on a snowy Christmas night. Definitely worth a try."
"D - This is a strong bier with a very distinct taste. Bit like a dubbel; would be great for cold nights by the fire."
"jd"
"D - I'm happy I was able to have this breweries winter seasonal. I enjoy all their beers and this didn't disappoint."
"Still, not my favorite offering from Brasserie d'Achouffe, but that's due to their really amazing ales. This has also outstripped all the winter ales I've had this year so far...except maybe Anchor."
"D: No alcohol present , A nice warming sipper"
"A very nice BSDA. Not the most complex I have had, which is not a bad thing. Just all around solid, and enjoyable. Something I would recommend."
"Had a La Trappe in San Francisco. What better way to end the night than with a stiff, malty Thing like this. Ruby red, loads of cherries in the aroma along with enough malt to push you off of the barstool. Very thick body, sweet but not icky or sticky. Not far from the tone of a Flemish Red, with a dry sourness that enters through the kitchen door after the initial sweetness has faded. You cannot drink this quickly; doing so risks a ruinous headache at the end of the glass. Instead, enjoy in good time."
"Highly drinkable... may too easily drinkable given the alcohol content! Will definitely look for this in the future."
"toffee, rum soaked fruit, candied orange peel, and pie crust. Good lord. This is a tasty beer."
"D - bought this out of a beer store, had a bit of dust on it but i trusted that it would hold up, and it has...might grab another one or two, havent gotten into belgians in awhile, now I realize why i loved them so much"
"Notes: review is for a 2007 vintage bottle, found in the back of a cooler at a beer store."
"Notes: Vintage 2009. A nice beer that combines a number of BSDA flavors with some more Winter Warmer/wintry spices. A touch thin and on the light side, but the flavor is still pretty full, probably because of the spices. It isn't amazing, but it is a nice spiced and warming beer. Definitely worth a try, especially on a cold winter night."
"Advice-- if it's 2011 and you have a 2010 bottle, save it til at least the end of the year :-)"
"D- Very sweet and boozy overall. This is indeed a winter warmer but lacks complexity."
"Pours a dark amber color slight red with 2 fingers of tanned head. Fair amount of retaining powers and sticky lace clings on to the glassware. Nose is a bit spicey and includes a bit of orange citrus feel to it. Taste is very similar to the aroma but is quite warming. Light feel with moderate amount of carbonation. Taste continues to be yeasty and a bit spicey as it warms but leaves me with the feeling of expecting more."
"As far as drinkability is concerned, it is not a stand out in my opinion, however it is by no means a drain pour. I could finish a glass however its doubtful given the option to try something else that I would have another."
"An easy to enjoy Belgian strong dark ale for the holiday season - even in mid-March."
"WOW. That's about all I can say. This is amazing and a great beery delicacy...as are all the other beers by Achouffe. (Gesundheit!)"
"D: Better out of the growler then on tap"
"D: Really nice beer. Not something you get often on tap nevermind a growler. Good drinker best shared with friends."
"I'd be interested to see what this is like fresh. Have a feeling the age did it a world of good."
"Finish is all malt, fruit and spices; this is really like a dessert ale! Drinkability is limited only because of the ""dessert"" quality and problematic food pairing. A full rich drink and a case of the bottle being a bit bigger and richer than the tap."
"Medium body is well carbonated, nice finish."
"D - At three years age, this brew is drinking phenomenal."
"Nice on a Sunday...."
"Reviewed from my notes. Served in a La Chouffe goblet. It has a medium brown color, opaque, with a thin skim of grey bubbles. I couldn't detect much aroma, but it was served pretty cold. It has a slightly sweet flavor, with some caramel notes. There is a lot of carbonation and a medium body. Overall, a pretty interesting beer that was fun to drink, but I don't think I'd order too many. I'm glad I got it on tap instead of in a bottle."
"Overall - A really good brew - well done and delicious. If your not in the mood to try a very spiced winter brew then do not drink this beer. If you are at all you should jump on it as fast as you can."
"You can feel the 10.0%abv as you make it through the bottle, but you certainly don't taste it. This is very nice, very smooth and nicely drinkable."
"Awesome dark Belgian ale. Really love this one."
"Worked very well with sweet saffron bread."
"Overall this N'Ice Chouffe has always been a solid Belgian winter ale and the 2008 is no different. Recommended."
"D: Very complex, my favorite Christmas ale during a 9-beer tasting of various Belgian Christmas ales."
"M&D - Very smooth but the sweetness makes this hard to drink. I am usually a big fan of their creations but this one just didn't strike me the same way."
"one person review (calen)"
"D- this beer seems to have a little something extra that sets it apart in a very nice class of beer. really enjoyed this beer. very drinkable for 10% abv. couldn't think of a better beer on this New Year's eve."
"Mouth: Sharp, lively carbonation. Warm, yeasty body with plenty of fruit flavors. Distinctly Belgian. Pleasantly drinkable. Biscuity, full bodied, chewy. A pleasure to drink."
"Very drinkable for the style and ABV. A very ""n'ice"" winter Belgian Strong Ale overall."
"Delicious, perfect winter warmer... *à la Borat* VERY N'ICE !!!"
"This is a nice winter brew which goes down easy. Worth a try if you happen to see it."
"Medium-full bodied with raisin and sweet malt mingling with the spicy yeast. There's an herbal note, nutmeg, and a sweet watermelon fruitiness. Has an alcohol presence but not really the taste and becomes creamy and really smooth when it opens up. Not bad at all, but it almost overwhelms in much quantity."
"I am not sure if I believe it is indicative of winter warmer style, but it is one of the most unique tasting beers I've had to date."
"Overall - A pretty good Belgian Strong Ale... well worth a try..."
"M&D: the super fine yet still lively carbonation supports the flavour with a fresh touch, while the hop profile somehow helps to keep a clean palate vis-à-vis the rich flavour profile. I've forgotten how tasty McChouffe (the dark one) is, but this Bigger'Chouffe seems to feature a bit more hoppiness, in a skilful and mouthwatering way...! I can drink this ale all night, if I can afford many bottles, that is... 8-P"
"Nice Winter Warmer."
"Overall, this is one of the better offerings I've had from Brasserie Achouffe as of yet. I still have a bottle of the McChouffe in the cellar which I have yet to try, but will probably do so in the next couple. This is a very bold and complex beer, which sits very well with me. It's very unique in the way the spiciness and sweetness are intertwined. I would highly recommend this brew."
"Deep dark brown color. The head is large on top, has great retention, and leaves a show of lacing in the glass. Despite the strength of the beer, it seems a little mellow. Some plums are noticable, along with the dark fruity yeast, plus the addition of whatever mellow, oddball spice Brasserie d'Achouffe puts in their other beers. It doesn't have the same ""warming effect"" as other winter warmers, but is still a darn good ale."
"The alcohol is not even remotely noticeable. There is a complexity that is super subtle and the finish is smooth and clean."
"The beer pours a cloudy dark brown color with a thick frothy tan head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a rich and fruity aroma that's heavy handed with dark candy sugar and crystal malts. It's sweet with a roasted edge as well as being spiced appropriately. The taste is good also. It's incredibly smooth with a nice crystal/roasted malt flavor as well as a wonderful Belgian yeast fruitiness. It boasts of dark fruits and candy sugar. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with good carbonation. This is a tremendous beer. It's a full flavored Belgian ale with kick ass yeast character and a well balanced malt bill; very tasty."
"For all the flavor this beer packs in, it is light and crisp, like a spiced cider, and is quaffable, but at 10% you must bide your time. This is one holiday ale that I will make a point of having annually."
"quite a bit of spice present, being appropriately portioned, its a little bit difficult to fully identify, but as the label claims thyme, i will admit to sensing its presence. general yeastiness in the smell as well. the taste is quite malty for a belgian, sugary complexity. the maltiness turns into a mix of spices and yeasty finish. its incredibly smooth and the complexity is what you would expect for a belgian. high in yeast, maltiness, and a good mix of spattering. i can see why its high ranked, and enjoy it, but still just dont love these styles all so much. but as its intended its all well executed exactly as style."
"At The Blind Tiger, NYC: poured a cloudy dark amber/copper into a tulip, with one finger of white head and good lacing. The smell was a nice mix of strawberry, raspberry, cinnamon, and currant. The taste revealed a much larger malty presence, mixed with caramel, berries, cherries, and apple throughout, and finishing on a sweet note with a slight alcohol burn. Thick, smooth, and syrupy on the palate. A nice sipping beer for the cold winter months."
"Very satisfying! Tastes heavy and complex with a creamy swallow. Lots of Belgian yeasts, dark over-ripe fruits...raisins, figs, dark sugars. Alcohol is definitely noticeable at room temp. Drank at around 60 degrees. Not overly carbonated at all. Very good beer!"
"Aroma is of strong dark fruits with a hint of hops. The flavor is malt forward with, again, fruits and hops. Mouthfeel and drinkability are good. I would recommend this over a winter warmer or most other belgian strong darks."
"2007 vintage. This poured a nearly opaque mahogany with some light tan head. It smelled like rich caramel and honey wheat with some sour yeast and candi sugar, and a bit of milk chocolate and heavy cream. It tasted like rich caramel and toffee and raisin and honey wheat, with lots of creamy yeast and a bit of sour apple. It was slightly thick with smooth carbonation, and had a bittersweet aftertaste. Overall this had a very nice, rich and complex taste. It had great body too, and hid the alcohol well. Capable of being drunk easily, but super sweet and delicious flavors should be savored more slowly. (Similar to Cuvee Van De Keizer, but not quite as good.) Curious how this is fresh, but it was excellent after aging for a couple years."
"Pours a clear, light brown color with a creamy light tan head. The nose is very light aroma of sweet malt. The flavor is also sweet but has very vinous qualities. The finish is dry and similarly sweet and vinous. The flavor fades nicely and leaves with a gentle warming sensation."
"D: Low drinkability as the alcohol is very present and the beer is extremely rich."
"This beer was definitely brewed for winter making it a N'Ice choice for a holiday drink. I plan on aging the same 2008 for another year to compare to this one."
"D: Alcohol is evident, with a moderate burn on the aftertaste, but the flavors are so good that this is definitely drinkable. Very good."
"Overall the bottled version's flavors weren't quite as large as I remember it being on-tap. Still, it's a tasty beverage and one that's worth a shot."
"Drinkability is very good -- another fine Belgian Strong Dark to sip after dinner. I really enjoyed this, it reminds me of Gouden Carolus' Grand Cru in a lot of ways, but like a little brother to it. Great holiday brew."
"Drinkability: So close. Leave out the spice and orange and let the beer speak for itself. As it is, its an almost. I wont buy it again."
"A lovely beer - possibly too high gravity to drink a great deal of - and the heat is so integrated into the palate that you notice every sip. But nonetheless, a truly very delectable and enjoyable brew."
"D - Probably the most drinkable 10% beer I've ever had. Plenty of character with nothing dominating. Very well balanced."
"Reviewed on 06/22/2009. On tap at Sunset Grill, Boston. This beer pours brown with a thick white head. The aroma is of sweet malt and light fruits. The flavor is initially lots of sweet malt with slight spices. Kind of bland and too sweet also. Meh..."
"This is a damn good strong dark ale. Not as sweet as a Kasteel Brune but quite close. Went well with some crumbly cheese. Whilst it made for a good late night sipper it wasn't quite the winter warmer I was expecting."
"A 750ml bottle shared with psycohops and brothercannon. 2005 vintage poured into a trio of basic snifters. The ale appears a dark copper color with about an inch of fluffy light ecru foam. Nose and flavor consist of sweet candi, peppery yeast, plums/prunes, toffee drizzled raisins, sugary breads. The ale is medium to full bodied and more than adequately carbonated for the style."
"D - 10% ABV? No way! This strong ale really mellowed out and morphed into a rich, sweet and malty brew that concealed its alcohol extremely well."
"Edit, 12-21-11: Had it on tap at the Merry Monk in Albany, a new Belgian bar that opened recently. Similar experience, though now with the last category being ""overall"" instead of ""drinkability"" I've bumped up the score there to 4. Noticeable alcohol keeps this one from scoring higher all-around."
"Out of a 750ml capped bottle. Pours a nice ruby brown color, some big yeast floaters at the bottom, a nice tight egg-shell colored head that left a nice sheet of sticky lacing on the glass. The aroma is sweet, vinous, with a bit of peppery spice, typical BSDA. Deep red wine, perhaps some sherry, flavors hit up front with a nice counter-balance of dark candi-sugar, some lights hints of tobacco or an earthy spice. There is a bit of a weird sourness or bitterness to this that I cannot quite place. The feel is moderate with plenty of carbonation, some fusel alcohol is present; though sweet overall finishes with a dry and bitter kick. A nice BSDA, nothing from this brewery disappoints. The brew is a bit boozy and dry/bitter for the style. Still a good pick up."
"This beer pours a thick brown color. The head is two inches of tannish white foam that recedes slowly into nice lacing. The aroma is anise, plums, and malt. The taste is a nice balance of malt, and spice with the anise sticking out slightly. The mouthfeel is medium full bodied with very lively carbonation. Overall, this is a good Belgian Strong Ale, but not a great one."
"This beer is a little hot yet, it's the 08 edition, next christmas is would be perfect. Definitely something nice to try though."
"Mouthfeel is soft and lush, softly carbonated, creamy, light but feel. Word class beer, one of my winter favorites."
"Another great beer from d'Achouffe. I still prefer their IPA."
"D: you notice the 10% ABV, but not until it's too late :) I wasn't expecting to be a big fan of this style, but it really is the perfect warming winter ale...for some occasions. I still wouldn't have more than 1 bomber, and I'm still sticking to my big stouts in the general case."
"Despite the holiday theme, this is one nice beer. Highly drinkable and that can be dangerous if you don't realize that it's 10%. Otherwise, pick it up. You could age it as well and it would likely improve anyway."
"d - At first I was ready to rate this as an average bomber and decent-at-best draft option if found in a bar. Once the bottle warmed up a bit the smell and flavor get a lot deeper but the alcohol masking weakens. The ABV hit on the finish is harsh and raw. I probably won't buy it again."
"Feel and Drinkability: The beer has a certain weightiness to it. It comes with the curacao flavor, a certain thick and heavy quality that makes the brew feel full bodied. Carbonation is almost undetectable, a quality that fits this beer well, and something that I feel gives the impression of a heavier body. As aforementioned it slightly warms the mouth and the throat as it goes down. This brew's got a dry finish with some peppery spiciness to it. This is one that I'll have no problem finishing, I look forward to it. As a matter of fact I think that I might just add this to my line up of brews to go with Thanksgiving dinner. Its that good, this is the first time I've had it and I'd really like to see how it goes with dinner tomorrow. Very drinkable, and one of the most unique Belgian Strong Darks that I've ever drank. Real good and dangerously drinkable. Get your hands on this one. Don't know how it is fresh, but I can tell you that at a year old it is drinking real nice."
"Keep lugging that malt gnomes."
"Off the tap at American Flatbread this beer was a deep copper color with a cream-colored head. The retention was good as an oil-on-water skim and the lacing was patchy. The aroma was of caramel malt, roasted malt, Belgian yeast, figs and currants. The flavors were distinctly sweet and pungent, big caramel malt, toffee, black cherries, hints of coffee, dark fruits, light chocolate, hints of white pepper, some wood and at the very end I got tart yeast. The 10% was well-concealed but it did make itself present in a bourbon-like way. Generally sweet but not quite cloying. The mouthfeel was semi-smooth, the body medium/full and the carbonation a little too soft. A true example of the style and a challenging brew."
"D: It's scary how well this goes down. One bottle is more than enough for me. All around very well crafted beer."
"D= Definitely a great winter warmer from Belgium. The flavors and the alcohol in this just scream out to be enjoyed by a roaring fire in the dead of winter. Though it could still have used another year of aging, this was a damn interesting and drinkable beer at almost 2 years old."
"D - A little more spicy than a regular belgian strong dark but very tasty."
"A lot of boozy quad-like overtones, which I've never gotten from this beer before."
"I had this on tap at High Street Grill. It was presented in a La Chouffe glass, very dark with a thin white head. The aroma was malty sweet, but otherwise unremarkable. The flavor was sweet and slightly phenolic, I did not notice the thyme. A medium bodied beer that is deceptive for its 10% abv."
"Drinkability- not my favorite holiday brew."
"I chalk this up as a good entry level into the style, not too intimidating at all, baby steps all the way, yet still delivers the goods."
"the drinkability is uncanny given the abv. drinks like beer with half the booze. a little too sweet for a flawless 5 though. in any case an excellent winter beer. finish the bottle by myself tonight? don't mind if i do."
"d. just once a year, as a christmas celebration, very drinkable."
"D: Very drinkable. Goes down smooth, not too sweet or too dry. A traditional session (about 8 pints in 4 hours) with this would probably result in difficulty standing up straight, if not visions of pink elephants -- but I don't think a session beer is what the brewer was going for. As such, this one is highly drinkable."
"strong big taste beer. i like this seasonal beer. its dark and has a thick chocolaty taste. its a strong beer so drinkadility wise, i think 1 or 2 of these and i would be maxed out for a while or until i got some food. best part of this beer for me were the particles in the very last sip."
"Taste is sweet and malty with strong candisugar notes. The alcohol adds a nice and warming feel to the beer. This is a strong sucker with 10%. In this beer there is a honey-like taste. The apparent spices of thime and orange peel are only a subtle addition, which are hard to pinpoint, only a flint of spice."
"Drinkability: This is the best Christmas beer I've ever had. I hope I can pick some up well into January!"
"More than drinkable, this is a treat. This beer has been on my ""look out for"" list for years, and did not dissapoint."
"An OK ""dessert beer"" with a refreshing tart flavour. Maybe it will be better after a few years' cellaring."
"Drinkability: This doesn't have the lively mouthfeel of most Belgians and perhaps that is due to its age, and I have to say that while the herbs add an interesting element to the beer, they aren't that enjoyable an adjunct to me"
"8/4/8/4/15/3.9"
"Mouthfeel/drinkability: High carbonation and a great alcohol burn make this a great beer for the style."
"D - Really different most Belgian dark strong ales, but good."
"I split this bottle with two friends tonight. It poured a chestnut brown with a fairly foamy head. The smell was mostly spices and a touch of candi sugar. The taste was good, alot of wondeful spices and a nice rounding off of raisins, sugar and spices. Almost tasted spicy for a split second. It went down smooth but I'm glad I split three ways. I would recommend you try this! Very nice winter warmer here"
"Pours a murky chestnut brown color, big foamy tan head is slow to fade, and leaves lots of lace in its wake. Sweet dark fruits on the nose, raisins, spicy alcohol, sugary sweet. Lots of plum/raisin flavors, brown bread, some hot alcohol on the tongue. Fizzy little bubbles, belly-warming alcohol, this is a good-for-the-winter brew. See, here's where I show my ass a little, in regards to the different styles of Belgian beer: To me, it tastes a lot like a Dubbel. Either way, a tasty beer."
"Pours a beautiful opaque chocolaty brown with a fine-bubbled head. The malty and strongly spicy aroma has a firm hint of chocolate. Flavor is rich with a nice balance of hops and malt, as well as an overtone of cloves and a hint of sweetness. Finish is lively and tingly."
"Be careful--even after one chalice, this is a different beast."
"Not a ton to say about this beer. Pours great with a very good 2 finger head that retains itself. The color is an extreamly dark amber but not quite brown. The initial taste is good with a nice malty sweetness-bannana evident as well- followed by a heavy spicyness/bitterness probably excentuated by the curacao. A noticeable hotness on the nose and tounge, but it is to be expected as it comes in at 10% abv. However, unfortunately this all breaks down rather quickly into an off, highly medicinal taste that lingers. This also hurts the drinkability for me because of said aftertaste. Not the worst beer, but for the price, and with the many other great seasonal Belgium offerings, it is not nearly my favorite."
"D: Dangerous, yes. But if you know what you're dealing with, you will bide your time with it."
"Cloudy brown with a thick off-white head. Raisins, grapes, and spice make up the aroma. Light but creamy mouthfeel. Sweet wine, banana, spice, and caramel malt dominate the palate. Orange peel, hops, and alcohol bring up the rear and stay with you. Good balance, good beer."
"D - Smooth, tasty, a real prototypical Winter brew."
"Drinkability: The drinkability for this big, warming, spiced concoction is fair. Another fine beer from a fine brewery."
"Pours a nice dark chestnut brown with a frothy head with a slight beige tint. Aroma consists of hints of maltiness, spices and thyme with citrus undertones. Very cmplex taste consisting of plum and dark berries, chocolate malt, sugar cane, balanced out by a nice spiciness and slightly dry hopped finish. Very tasty."
"d- Very drinkable, but at 10% ABV beware."
"2007 Edition. A big, interesting Belgian Strong Dark Ale that has been flavored with Thyme and Curacao peel. The flavoring is a blessing and a curse. It does add interesting notes to the beer but also obscures some of the classic Belgian flavor. It's a good seasonal Belgian but it's compared against all BSD's, so that's a bit rough. The beer pours a lovely dark brown with a puffy head. The head dissipates a bit too quickly for a higher score. The nose is malty and earthy. It's an excellent strong Belgian flavor. There's plenty of spice and funky earthiness in the flavor. There's some interesting bitterness, which may be a product of the curacao, and is welcome."
"cellared for 1 year... vintage 2007. dark brown, tan head, fairly impressive retention for a higher abv and well aged monster. combination of thyme and sugar produces a scent and taste similar to the organic sodas or roots drinks you get at health food stores. herbal sweet, maty and spice that i wouldn't equate with the season come together nicely ( no pun intended ) to create a well balanced medium full nectar. the little bit of age it has on it really made it morph in to one well balanced entity of its own. another nice brew from chouffe."
"The beer poured a slightly cloudy, deep brown with a thin white head into a chalice. The aroma was of sweet candy sugar and that unique Belgian yeast profile. The taste was more of the sweet candy sugar, but dominated more by the Belgian yeast aftertaste, with significant alcoholic esters. A wonderful, full-bodied Belgian strong ale - just what you need for the cold months ahead."
"2007 bottle. Pours is a dark amber, almost brown with a very nice lingering off white head. Smell is a bit herbal. Hard to describe. Odd. Taste is very herbal / medecinal. Very odd - more like a european apertif if that makes any sense. Piney, but not resiny. Juniper berries? Mouthfeel is highly carbonated. Tastes quite hot as well. The mix of noticable alcohol and medecinal herbs may create a nice winter warmer, but does not work for me as a beer. In fact, I find it to be quite harsh. I'm afraid, in my case, drinkability is poor. Least favorite offing from this brewery, but that is just a matter of personal tastes."
"Drinkability: An interesting if not outstanding beer. This one's thick as hell, and the abv% is up there, though not necessarily for the style. On the other hand, it's mellow, pleasant, fairly complex, and smooth as hell. Give it a shot."
"D: Easy going down and plenty of spicy character, this is a good choice for a wintertime brew. At 10% ABV, this might make for a short session."
"D - Strong stuff but it's such a nice ale it's hard to resist, so buy two. :)"
"this is full of flavor, wow. lots going on. it definitely gets better as it warms up. can taste the many spices. mouthfeel is a little too crisp. hits the roof of the mouth and back of the throat."
"Dark, bubbly amber color topped off by big clingy head. Aroma of dark fruit and citrus peels sifts through the air. Medium bodied brew with mild carbonation that disguises the alcohol content well behind visages of dark candy sugar and sour orange peel. The beer finishes wet accompanied by candy sweetness that slathers the tongue and gums. A good winter beer if you are in the mood for orange rinds and candy corn."
"Chilled this in the fridge for 10 minutes after dinner for a dessert (I am not going to use the adjective nice in this review). Poured into a snifter for a leathery brown body with a quickly receeding one-finger head. Spicy and dark fruits in the nose, reminded me a little of a lambic with some blackberry currants or something; also mild sugariness. A spicy and very warming boost popped on my tonuge on the first sip, then the fruits and sweet malts take over. Not overly sweet, but there is some raw sugar in there and some fruits like orange peel (which is on the label, that's why I put it). Balanced pretty good, although there is a very minor alcohol burn. Somewhat sweet and spicy aftertaste, like gingersnaps. A good after diner beer to split between friends, but I couldn't session this or have another big bottle on my own."
"Overall Impression - This is a nice beer (pun intended), but I would not call it spectacular. I think this beer is balanced more toward the dark sugars, and I wish there was more of a malt presence, and possibly slightly higher IBU to get rid of the cloying character. It only needs a very minor adjustment, and I feel that this beer could be much better. For a 10% abv the alcohol is very well controlled. Some of the control could be attributed to the extra time in the bottle. I will say it's a little better than average."
"D: A nice balanced xmas drink, the spicing is not overly done, but the alcohol presence may limit this to moderation. Overall a good drink."
"D- Very great brew. Easy to drink."
"Some quick toasted malt before big fruit flavors. More Concord grapes, ripe pears, fruit punch. Sugary and sweet. A few roasted notes mid-palate. Rummy bananas and leather in the finish. Mild herbal and floral hop bitterness is barely discernible. Pretty good, if a bit sweet. Full-bodied with a slightly syrupy, yet creamy feel. very N'ice."
"Very pleasing and easy to drink. The bottle has a best by date of 09/08/2010. Impressive how the brewery knows the exact date their beverage expires. Very worth a try."
"Good texture overall, but it can be too fizzy. The heavy heady solventy booze limits this beer's drinkability for me - it almost seems to be causing a preemptive hangover in an effort to prevent me from drinking it - yet it's pretty good."
"This is a nice Belgian strong ale. The beer pours a tawny, somewhat cloudy color, with just a few yeasty bits flouting on the bottom. The beer does not have much of a head, some retention, not much lacing. The smell is candied sugars, caramel, some roasted malts, sweet malts, caramel, some berry or orange notes as well. The beer is a lot more light bodied than I would have predicted. It is still a medium bodied beer, but not as syrupy as a Belgian 10% ABV ordinarily would be. The taste is typically Belgian in that you will get the candied sugars, the big sweet malt tastes, warming alcohol notes, and some pepperishness in the finish. There are definitely discernible spices to this beer. I'm noticing orange rind, clove, maybe some allspice or cardomman. The downside to the beer, for me, is the throaty burn in the finish. I like my beers smoother, creamier, and less alcoholy than this one. But, at a 10% ABV, some of this is to be expected. This one is worth seeking out, although it isn't my favorite Belgian strong dark. L'Chaim."
"Opaque dark brown with a nice two finger, off white, micro bubbled head. The aroma kicks N'ice off well with notes of dried cherries, light melon in the back, spices, flowery alcohol esters, and a buttery caramel malt character. Nuttier malt tones on the palate accompanied by some cocoa, tart cherry fruit, prune, and raison. Alcohol is a bit hot, solvent-ie although does aid in a fruity, floral brandy character. Curacao is most evident in the finish but is a bit cough syrupy, and the thyme I couldn't detect anywhere. Semi-smooth mouthfeel and carbonation in on point. Some of the bad point about this beer improves as it warms and makes for a descent drink."
"All in all, a different Belgian strong dark, but you'd expect nothing less from those crazy gnomes. A huge beer, and hugely complex. If you choose to polish off the 750 yourself, it will last you for a good while, leaving you to ponder the complexity and craftsmanship. The gnomes know what they are doing....don't question the gnomes."
"D: One at a time for me on this one, though it's nice. I may prefer some of the other products a little more, but this one is still a good call."
"I will definitely get a few of these again next year."
"Pours a dark chestnut brown with a big head initially with tight bubbles. This fades to a cap that lingers. Smells sweeet with candi sugar, a touch herbal, spicy, and with some citrus, particularrly on the finish. The taste is rich and malty, and sweet with candi sugar. The thyme gives the beer a more earthy note that plays of the sweetness nicely. Spicy and a bit rummy, like a good fruitcake. Mouthfeel is a little too carbonated, and it could be a touch creamier. The high carbonation makes it a little les drinkable than it would be otherwise, but it is still tasty. Even though the alcohol flavors are there, it doesn't come off as hot at all. Not my favorite Belgian wwinter brew, but quite nice nevertheless."
"Pours a slightly cloudy root beer color with a full finger off white head that fades fairly quickly to surface. A good amount of lacing present. The smell is somewhat reserved. An earthy Belgain yeast and malty character that has a spicy factor and is a little sweeter at warmer temps. Boasts a classic effervescence that lends itself to an ultra creamy texture. The slightly sweet malty center expresses subtle dark fruit notes. The taste has slightly less depth than some. Lighter overall. The 10% ABV will be a surprise later. A really good drinker. The plan is to savor the balance of this sample. Recommended."
"Stopped into Super Saver Liquor Locker in Edison and to my surprise, came across this 750 ML, limited edition, vintage 2003 bottle of N'Ice Chouffe... After sampling other beers from this brewery, had high hopes for their winter selection... ""Best before end of 2008"" on the back - this bottle is 5 years old, so the full array of aromas and flavors should really come through on this one... Dark, mahogany-brown appearance with a frothy and tan head sat atop a dark-burgundy color hue... a noticeable aroma of caramel and figs poured through on this one, and led to a superb conglomeration of flavors that manifested itself in prune, brown sugar, candy, and toffee flavors... Very good taste with a hardly detectable 10% ABV makes for a terffic Belgain beer... Another winner from this exceptional brewery - all of their samples are top-notch... Glad I found this one... Recommended..."
"Mouthfeel has nice warm medium body. By the end of the bottle my mouth was feeling a little numb. Right now I am feeling very good."
"D- Extremely drinkable for a beer with such a high ABV. The smoothness of the brew makes it easy and tempting to chug or gulp, but the delicious flavors, complexity and price point demand that this is a beer to sip on and savor."
"Overall I'll finish the bottle without a problem, 2 might wreck me."
"D: A very good Christmas beer that only gets better as it warms up, got to buy a bottle of this each November or December."
"Deep mahogany color with little to no head. The aroma and flavor had a mild spicy character, some sugar evident, and a hint of bubblegum and Christmas cookies. The flavors were complex and tasty without being over done - no overt sugary/ alcohol character. Yes, this one was quite ""N'Ice."""
"Pours deep amber with a thin off white head, which disappears rather quickly. Beautiful aromas of raisins and licorice. First sip is rather spicy, which gives way to slighty bitter orange zest flavor. Strong alcohol prescence gives way to whiskey flavors. The mouthfeel on this one is good, slighty dry, it leaves a fruity flavor in the mouth. The first beer of 2008, may the rest be this good. I look forward to picking up one of these next Christams."
"D: It was a joy to drink...so much so that in some ways I regretted having to share the bottle. I wanted more when my allotment was done. I enjoy Mc Chouffe but this excellent BSDA gives it a run for my favorite from this fine brewery."
"Poured very nicely in a reddish brown colour and with good foam and lacing. The smell was of apple must and yeast. The taste was red jam-ish, sweet and yeasty with notes of bread and spices. Although the ABV is high the alcohol was not so noticable in the taste. It's important to serve this beer just slightly chilled and wait a while before drinking to bring out the full taste."
"A flavorful beer to enjoy sipping on in the winter season."
"A wonderful beer experience from pour to gulp. This was very nice. A year did not diminish it by any means. I really enjoyed the way it started soft & full and finished in more of the typical Belgian style. Definitely a nice sipper for a cold winter's evening & a beer that can hold up to at least a few years of aging. This would pare nicely with a milder Bleu or a nice dry Cheddar, perhaps even Cotswold & the like. While I'm sure there are number of food offerings that would be nice (they would need to have some zest or spice to them) I feel that this one might be best enjoyed as a sipper. I will definitely make a point of visiting the Choufee gnomes every December. Recommended with no hesitation."
"750ml bottle: I had this one on Xmas Eve. It pours a dark brown, ruby tinged color. There was a decent sized beige head on it. A fairly decent amount of lacing. A fair amount of malts to the nose, with some roastiness and spiciness. The taste is quite good. Fairly full bodied with a hint of roastiness to the strong malts. Not real sweet, but nicely balanced. Some fruits coming through also. An excellent holiday beer."
"Poured from a 750mL bottle, 2007 batch. The beer was dark burgandy color, mostly clear with some floaties. At first there was a pretty good volume of foam, but it passed out quickly. The aroma was sweet malt and spicy spices (guessing thyme and curacao peel from the label). The taste was about as complex as any I've had, lots of competitions between sweet malts, tangy citrus, bitterness and sweetness and spices (maybe add coriander to the previously listed ingredients). Very very nice, and perfect for Christmas Eve."
"All in all I think this seasonal ale is likely quite drinkable. I just think I got a bad bottle."
"Bottle poured dark brown with a tan head that goes quickly to lace aromas of sweet fruit holiday spices and bread .Nice creamy moderately full mouth feel .sweet malts and candies as well as flavors of orange , spices and hops that help calm the sweetness Another wonderful brew from Chouffe"
"Poured into a glass goblet. Pours dark brown with the color and texture of gulden draak vintage. The head quickly dissipates into a thin ring. The nose is spicy and of slight dark fruit. Raisin and date. Taste is a similar to gulden, but with more spice and less strength. dark fruit flavors with some orane and spice flavoring. slight hop finish, aftertaste fades quickly. Mouthfeel is odd as it feels a little overcarbonated and quite thin. Drinkability would be good but the carbonation makes it kind of abrasive. Good beer, would probably age very well."
"D: Alcohol to me was evident but a tremendous seasonal beer that you cant put too many down but one or two of these to start a cold night would be ideal."
"Mouthfeel: Lower in carbonation than other d'Achouffe beers I've had, but that's not a bad thing at all. It's smooth, warming, and really easy to drink despite the high ABV and the sheer thickness of it."
"I liked this beer alot.This is the better of the two Chouffe beers I tried."
"2006 bottle poured into a Duvel snifter. The beer pours a nearly opaque deep brown with a decent frothy off-white head that diminishes to a ring and leaves spotty lacing. The aroma is brown sugar and molasses with some dried fruits, coffee and just a hint of chocolate. The taste is extremely complex. Dried fruits dominate with some spice and some molasses. The beer is very heavy and somewhat aggressively carbonated. This one is certainly a sipper, decently enjoyable on a cold autumn night."
"The taste is laced with chewy alcohol esthers, raisin bread, and spices galore. Quite the complex brew; it coats the mouth with a big, viscous body that packs a full-fledged carbonation level and a fierce alcohol finish. All in all, this is a beer to be cherished over a yule-tide fire. Drink carefully, though, as this brew packs a punch. Shame that I downed it in October, but what's done is done. I'll most likely look for this one again."
"Finishe leaves a taste like a dry wood stick in your mouth, but not in a bad way necessarily."
"750 ml bottle, courtesy of Cardinal pub, Stavanger. ABV is 10%. 19 degrees Plato. Refermented in the bottle, unfiltered and unpasteurised. Ingredients include sugars, thyme and curacao. Hazy reddish dark brown colour, huge tan head. Pleasant but fairly moderate aroma with vinous notes, notes of oak and spices, hints of farmhouse. The flavour is distinctly spicy and oaky, with a substantial but not overwhelming sweetness from the malts and sugars. Some yeasty notes. Distinct hoppy bitterness in the aftertaste. Warming mouthfeel, but the 10% ABV does not dominate. As a Christmas beer, this one is better suited to accompany an English Christmas pudding than a main course of meats or fish - but is also nice to drink on its own."
"D: While this beer definitely gets points for its complexity, I'm not so sure this is one I'd want to revisit too often. With a high abv that causes you to notice the alcohol, combined with spices that seem way dialed up, it seems a bit much. Had these features been scaled back a bit, I think it would have made a great Belgian Strong Dark Ale."
"Chouffe is still a NICE one to have and it is surely a good to great Belgian strong dark ale; a reminder is to be mindful of the ABV and the fact that it is a bomber; I am a little tipsy right now... signing off."
"The beer pours a mahogany brown color, looking very much like a glass of A&W rootbeer. There is not a great deal of head to this beer, but what there is lasts quite well. Lacing is also quite excellent. I don't get a lot on the nose, maybe some cola/rootbeer (again) and belgium spice. On the palate this beer is very rich and warming, with flavors of sweet malt, melon, cherry, maple syrup and butter. The beer is pretty sweet, but not overly so, and the beer is quite sublime. This beer is incredibly soft and smooth on the palate, with no rough edges. The finish is quite long and the mouthfeel is pure silk. The abv. is really hard to detect, but the beer is quite warming, so you know it's up there. The beer has a very clean, soft finish. Impressive."
"Cheers!"
"A medium full body with ample carbonation and a large ABV of 10% make for a good, velvety mouthfeel with spicy aftermath. Highly drinkable for such a big, dark Belgian...I really enjoyed this one and definetly recommend it...oh yeah."
"Served in a large thin stemmed goblet, pours a dark murky brown. The aroma is lots of dark malts and Belgian yeast earthiness. The taste is that of a dark belgian ale, though it seems there is some spice to it. Mainly sweet malt and some roastiness along with Belgian yeast characteristics. Medium bodied mouthfeel, and the drinkability is not too bad for a bold beer like this."
"I must say I really enjoyed this beer. Especially the dark candy sugar. The inside of the bottle smelled like melting chocolate. Amazing. I loved the orange rind and the smooth malty taste. The bottle is also great. The finish was excellent as well. The dark candy sugar came out at the end. I would definitely drink this again!"
"Thanks Sammy!"
"Overall, a very nice sipping beer on a cold day. This 2003 version aged very well. Nice rounded edges for a beer this big."
"drinkability is good. balanced and very enjoyable. i especially appreciated the restraint on the spices. just the right amount without being overdone."
"The king of Chouffe. Light head on dark orange colour. Medium mouthfeel. Spicey and yeast and malt aroma. Lace, some yeast, sugar. This is a controlled orange and spice beverage, worthy of the sip. Yes there could be thyme. 2006. Unique Belgian, surprising 10%."
"Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied with a an almost dangerous drinkability with the 10% abv being nearly undetectable."
"Pours a hazy brown with a thick brown/tan head of huge bubbles. Aroma is lots of yeast, light dried fruit (apple and pear), and a spicy zing- maybe nutmeg? Flavor lets the fruit take the lead. Sweet figs with the yeast way in the background. Mild, yet dry and spicy aftertaste. Body on the medium to light side. This one is insanely easy to drink at 10%abv. Just a hint of warming gives away the high alcohol. Very nice. Next time Ill find an opaque drinking vessel. This doesnt look very appetizing in the glass, but tastes great."
"Cheers!"
"Whoa! As a huge fan of Chouffe products, I'm amazed that I had yet to try this wonderful beer. This is the perfect Belgian winter warmer and I'm sure it would be equally enjoyable throughout the year. Viva La Chouffe!"
"Bottle: Poured a deep hazy golden/beige color ale with a huge foamy head with good retention and great lacing. Aroma of spices with some sweet malt and typical Belgian yeast. Taste is quite sweet with some dominating spices and a yeasty spicy finish. I didnt think the Chouffe yeast came out as much as it did in their other beers. Body was above average with great carbonation and no alcohol was discernable."
"Drinkability: Man, NOT for me. I simply don't get this beer. I think it might work better with food than on its own; perhaps the thyme melds well with some of the winter lamb/game dishes and stews you might run across. As a stand-alone, though, that huge fresh herb just has no place in the otherwise rich malt and sweet spice mix -- ruined it for me."
"This is an excellent Belgian Winter Ale. Highly recommended."
"A rather complex profile of flavors; however, none are that assertive. At 10% abv, the brewers have done a respectable job at masking the alcohol presence."
"Pours a big thick head that doesn't dissapate f a while. Also leaves a good strong lacing, the color is dark ruby/brown and very dark. The smell is sweet with burnt sugar and smells a lot like Aventinus. The smell is light a fruity. The taste of alcohol is very prevelent, but the taste is very good. It's fruity and smooth. It's smooth, but also has a little carbonation. Overall I would try this sometime in the future."
"Drinkability: very flavorful and spicy beer that is a slow sipper. The bottle is easy to quaff over a long period. Great cold weather beer too."
"The beer poured with a deep dark rich color with a slight white foam. The smell was pleasant with hints of malt and fruit: cherry and/or candied orange. The carbonation was strong but added a complexity to the beer. The taste was deep with the flavors of cherry and strong hops almost cigar-like flavor."
"D: for a 10% ABV strong ale, this is remarkably drinkable, I took my sweet time with it and enjoyed over the course of 60-90 minutes. I'd definitely buy this beer again."
"I considered waiting until I could acquire a fresher bottle before reviewing this Brasserie d'Achouffe offering. I'm glad I didn't. This is one humdinger of a BSDA that has just enough distinctiveness (thyme and orange peel?) to make it stand out from the world-class crowd. N'ice Chouffe is a very, very n'ice version of one of my favorite Belgian styles."
"Nice."
"Drinkability is very good for this strong beer. It is definitely a beer that gets better as it warms and small sips are recommended. This is an excellent beer to share with friends on a cold, winter day."
"D: This stuff smells awful, but other than that, not too shabby. Worth a try and perhaps worth aging."
"D: Creamy and smooth. Excellent drinkability. More spicy than the other noels I've had this season so far, a bit fuller, and cheaper to boot. High abv doesn't cloud the senses and is hardly noticeable."
"Pours nearly-clear dark brown & red with quickly-subsiding tan head and good lace. The aroma is faint. Malt, some medicinal alcohol, bananas and spice. Flavors are nicely balanced. Toasted grains and hops blend into spiced bananas and rum-like caramelized sugar. Finish is medium-sweet and short. The beer is medium-thick in body, with some oily slickness and good lively carbonation. An enjoyable holiday warmer."
"Mouthfeel is good. Although very sweet, this beer seems very balanced and very drinkable. A definite tribute to a experienced, world class brewery."
"Drinkability: Good drinkability for a strong winter beer."
"The body is fairly thick and creamy. Mild carbonation. Dry finish with little aftertaste. The alcohol is undetectable. Very good. I will probably try the fresher '06 version just to see how it compares, but this is a wonderful beer."
"Poured from the 750ml capped bottle into a La Chouffe tulip glass. Body is a reddish brown color with garnet highlights, topped by a smallish creamy tan head that settles to a thin, sturdy crown. Aroma of dark Belgian malt, candy sugar, dark fruit (figs), and holiday spices that become more prevalent as the beer warms up. Palate is rich and malty up front, with a good bit of candy sugar. The subtleties of dark fruit and spice emerge mid-palate, with a good bit of holiday spice coming through. The sweetness takes over again on the swallow, yielding to a nice, warming finish that's the only hint of the 10+% alcohol. Body is rich, creamy, smooth, and damn near perfect. Another excellent offering from d'Achouffe."
"Pours a dark dark brown that contains a bit of a red color, with a smallish light tan head that recedes somewhat quickly and doesn't appear to leave any lacing. Smells of sugary malts, lots of spices, and maybe a bit of orange. Tastes of brown sugar, sweet malts, some nice mild hops, rasins, a bit of chocolate, and plenty of spices top this pleasant winter warmer. This is definitely a nice beer, it'd be a lot nicer if it was snowing outside and I'd come in from a day of skiing. That's not a knock on the beer though. Overall I'm greatly impressed with this offering and i'll be picking up a few more of these!"
"N'ice Chouffe is a fantastic winter warmer from a brewer that never disappoints. It is spiced, which I enjoy during the winter, but none of the spices play the leading role. Very well balanced and integrated. I think this bottle could have gone in the cellar for another year, but there is nothing at all wrong with it right now. Highly recommended for winter beer lovers."
"D: Nice beer. A touch cloying after a while but thats sometimes the price you pay with dark belgian ales. Not overly complex, just nice and smooth."
"Pours out dark brown with a red hue on the edge, raisin like. There'sa thin off white head that floats on top momentarily. Big huge nose, malt, alcohol, spice, orange peel. Taste is berry fruit like, with lots of malt, alcohol, spice, orange peel, and more alcohol. I may be mentioning the alcohol too much, it's actually quite balanced. Has a slick to creamy mouthfeel, and a big rip roaring finish."
"Drinks okay despite the heft, won't lie to ya, love this brewery in my favorite part of BE& I'm not sure they can make a bad beer"
"Dull gold murky appearance  nice white head white however, the head does not last long nose is malty , prunes , raisins , cereals , and oats , caramel , musty , and moldy very sharp  medium sweet sparkly body  initial taste is sweet then turns acidic, and malt , dried prunes , citrus flavor - aftertaste is medium with a creamy, acidic and roasted malts *2003 edition*"
"Opened up a 750ml bottle with cork & cage. The beer was a deep dark brown with red highlights, very clear. It produced a large, light tan head. Aroma was of yeast, spices (mint?), alcohol and cotton candy. Flavor fit with the aroma, in that it was all about sweet. Berries, grapes, some port wine character. The finish had a bit of an acidic bite to it and a lingering sweetness. Body was medium to heavy, with fairly low carbonation. ABV came through hear as a warming sensation. A very complex beer, which didn't really ring my bell. I like a little bit more bitter to balance the sweet."
"I feel like I should grab several of these and have them on hand for special nights. I wish I could afford to do that. I surely would because I really enjoyed this beer. Chouffe is really a special brewery that I'm glad I've become aquainted with."
"A good version of a beer style that works very well as a Holiday beer. If there is any flaw to the beer it is the strong coriander flavor, a beer with lots of spice simply doesn't need any."
"Poured a clear, garnet color with tall, creamy, light brown foam that persisted and coated the glass. The smell was malty with hints of spices. The carbonation was biting in the nostrils. The taste was malty and fruity (oranges?) with a light sweetness and some spiciness which I could not put my finger on (coriander?). The mouthfeel was smooth though with a sharpness of flavor. The body was medium to full with good strong carbonation. Overall this beer was warming. The drinkability was good for this strong Belgian ale."
"Large green bottle, etching tells me its best to consume this necter before 2009...woohoo 3 yrs to go...Pours dark plum amber, semi hazy with a large tan head, initially rocky then melting to a thick film and leaving classic and extensive lacing. Nose of fruits, musty malt and yeasty Belgian goodness. Tasty, strong brew, notes of alcohol, cola, Belgian yeast, dark rum, sweet cookie tastyness. Classic strong brew, get some of this Chouffyliciousness and enjoy..."
"It's geared towards cold to cool weather drinking, but I've got a nice, warm spring day around me and this beer is doing me fine. I've heard the green glass on this one means it doesn't age too well, so you may want to be wary for looking this one up now. But, if you can find some that has been properly kept (mine was in the back of the fridge for 4 months, out of light's way), it's worth picking up."
"Vertical, with a 2002, 2003 and 2004 and I definately perferred te 2004, but I also hate oxidation. Dark ruby color. Very subtle aromatically, comparing multiple samples. Rich toffee and spice with a pretty overwhelming bitter and acidic flavor, along with an orange tone, which may come from spices. Musty yeast as well. Never really been to fond of it."
"This beer poured a dark reddish brown color with a fluffy one inch head. Aroma was malty and caramelly in the nose. Taste was quite alcoholic at first with notes of malt, spice, dark fruit, prunes and candi sugar. The beer had a slight hop bitterness in the finish. Overall, this beer tasted overly sweet to me and had a rather thin mouthfeel. I could barely detect the spices that are stated on the bottle(thyme, curacao peel). Drinkability was low due to the strong alcohol and excessive sweet taste. Kind of disappointing, but I guess that's part of the fun of trying new beers. Some really surprise you and others are a letdown."
"Delicious beer! Typically Belgian S. D. Ale in that it's very berry like in flavor, sweetness, tartness, and intensity. Sweetened with cotton-candy sugars, barley malt, and spices. Full and rich on the palate without becoming thick or heavy. Sweetly alcoholic, but swirled around the berry tartness. Lightly woody, musky, dates, and figs. Finishes lightly sweet, tart, and spicy. Looks very much like prune-juice, but tastes much better. A firm, rocky head tops off this juicy beverage."
"Poured into a tulip glass a slightly hazy russet brown with a huge blooming light brown head that sticks like glue as it slowly settles.Very spicey aromas like that of cinnamon and nutmeg with a touch of orange and prune underneath.The orange peel in this brew show on the palate along with some phenolic yeasty spiciness and raisin but its not overly sweet,somewhat breasy mouthfeel compliments the flavors nicely.Its a beer that goes down easy but not overly big flavor wise but solid none the less."
"Aroma is highly spiced and tickles the nose. Dark red/brown in color with a typically thick Belgian head. Flavor is somewhat muted in the fore to be honest. far less sweet than most Belgian X-mas ales and that is nice. The fore is very mellow malts and slight spice then the finish is dominated by the bitter orange that coats the tongue. If you press your tongue hard against the roof of your mouth youll feel how thouroughly the tongue is coated. A decent brew with a different approache, but I have to say it wasnt all that great to me."
"Bought this at Tully's; hadn't seen it there before. The bottle said Limited Edition 2005. An extraordinary , complex beer. It was a medium brown color with a coffee-colored head and some nice lacing. It had a distinct spicy odor, very warm, almost like a red pepper. Tasting was a revelation. It was sweet, orange, spices, some malt, and a nice warm aftertaste. A little bubbly for my taste. The alcohol is not noticeable at first, but it certainly sneaks up on you. Be careful with it."
"a creamy mouthfeel reveals spice: the bottle says thyme and dried orange peel. more appears from the yeast and its relationship with the candy sugar. white pepper and a fair amount of hop flavor"
"750 ml bottle. Limited edition 2005 on from silk screen."
"Overall, this is a sweet, sumptuous brew that is meant to be enjoyed by itself and only once in a while. Very sweet, very heady brew. A treat, but not as good a beer as, say, La Chouffe, the flagship beer for Brasserie d'Achouffe."
"Mouthfeel is subtle and sweet with a mild prickliness that is slick along the palate."
"beer is very drinkable but most enjoyed on a cold night."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Near perfection... Slick, rolling, and luscious in the mouth. The tiny bubbles whisk the gigantic, heavy strength of the beer elegantly down the gullet, leaving no harshness or cloying whatsoever. Each time I enjoy a bottle of this edition (2005), I walk away feeling like this beer is one of Winter's great treasures... and one to come back to again and again."
"This Belgian Strong Dark Ale pours medium-dark amber with a large head of carbonation. The smell to me was a light medicine smell. The taste, however, was a rich, warm, and caramel with the warming aftertaste of a bourbon due to the high alcohol content. The mouth feel was full and heavy but flat. This Belgian Ale is Nice."
"4.5 4.5 4.5 4.5 4.5 Approaching a 5.0 for both smell and taste."
"drinkability: very nice and easy. however once the bottle was done i woulda found it pretty hard to come back for another. that abv whooped me good."
"a dense beer with lots of red to it, essentially clear with some rough, cloudy patches. cream-coated with even sheets of lacing. apricot and fresh plum puree lead the team of aromatic fruits coming off this beer. green apple taffy with sugary, thick caramel profile. taste initially identifies the chouffe yeastiness and runs with it, mainly in the directions of brown sugar and cherry. reminiscent of a date and poppyseed muffin i ate recently. warming, immediately, although not bogged down with alcohol. much to easy drinking for 10%, obviously my last beer of the night. crisp and charred, somewhat vegetal in the aftertaste. intriguing and the most different beer offered by chouffe."
"Vintage 2003-been saving this one. Pours a nice deep brown color. Great creamy, somewhat tan head that doesnt quit. Nice malty and spicy aroma. Somewhat vinuous and peppery. Malty and spicy flavor. Slightly floral-the curacao orange really seems to come thru and add a nice, pleasant fruity flavor. Very nice body-extremely full without a trace of the alcohol. Very, very drinkable. Well worth trying and saving some for a few years later."
"Drinkability: Easily drinkable and pleasure to consume. This beer went perfectly with the Triticus Ale Lamb at the Publick House. It's rich and can stand on its own with bold foods but it is not overpowering on its own. I will enjoy this one again."
"The taste of this beer starts out tart, like a tart fruit, and finishes with a nice sweet mix of fruit and sweet spice; like clove, mace and allspice perhaps. The finish also has a slight note of chocolate and more so even a hint of roasted malt, though both are quite subtle. This is quite rich, it really works as a night cap. It is a nice balance between the tart and the sweet character."
"Notes: Its good, nothing wrong with it at all, I want more winter, I want more spice, I want SOMETHING that would make me buy it again. I put a bottle away to age, now I am not sure I will waste the time."
"Pours a deep brown with ruby shades around the edges and a nice, thick tan head that retains well. The aroma is complex with notes of dark fruit (currant, plum, blackberry), candied sugar, spices, chocolate, light fruity yeast character and some slight floral hops. The flavor begins with a big dark fruit character (plum, fig, currant, blackberry), followed by a candied sugar sweetness, a spiced character (nutmeg, cinnamon, corriander, clove), some fruity yeast esters, chocolate, and a tea-like hops flavor thats very subdued. The mouthfeel is full and rich, but not overwhleming...very decadent but not thick. Drinkability is also good. A very nice beer from Achouffe, complex and delicious...also definately a candidate for cellaring."
"A clean brown beer with bright ruby highlights. Has a big foamy tan head and very nice lace. The aroma is sweet and spicey with some sweetness coming from the malt and some citrus fruit sweetness. There are hints of various spices woven throuout the aroma, cinnamon, nutmeg come to mind at first (a little like a pottporri). The malty character coats your tongue with a light toasted grain sweetness. While the hops and spices stay at the back of your mouth for a nice dry finish with a hint of tabacco in there."
"Warming, soft, darkly sweet, and quite good and drinkable for 10%. A very nice Belgian brew. Recommended."
"Was expecting a little more from this beer. Maybe waiting 4 years to try it wasn't the best move. I'd like to try a greener bottle and compare."
"Odd little brew from the land of the gnomes. Pours a murky brown with a lot of yeasties. The head is a nice mocha color and maintains its shape and presence the entire session. The aroma is one that I cannot say I have come across before. A very herbal and horse blanket nose makes you wonder how it will taste. The taste is a little overpowered with the earthy, herbal presence. I like how the herbs mix with the sweetness, but it still seems a bit odd to me. The candied sugar doesn't come out until it warms up a bit. When it was just below room temp, this beer seemed to really pull together. The sweetness of the sugar balances well with the rough and earthy body. The high abv is very well hidden, but like LaChouffe, this one creeps up on you and spins your mind in circles. Drinkable....yes, but not more than a bottle here and there. I would like to taste a fresh bottle and see the difference. In my opinion, the whole thyme thing doesn't make magic for me."
"Full mouthfeel makes its way into every part of my mouth without being chewy or leaving any oils. Drinkability?....Not a session beer, but I'm already making plans to buy and stash a few more bottles."
"750ml bottle from 2004. Dark brown with some red highlights coming through. A tall light tan head formed and stayed a decent size while leaving a light webbing of lace. Some light spices and a big candy sweetness come out right away. A few other light scents in the background but the sugary smell seemed to drown them out for the most part. Plenty of sugary sweetness up front on the flavor with a decent bit of chocolate and spice to try and balance it out. There are also some fruity notes as well. Finishes up with a lightly spicy and sugary flavor. Seemed a bit thin at times but overall pretty solid and smooth. The sweetness got a bit cloying by the end of the bottle but it went down fairly easily. One glass of this would have been ideal the 750 tended to wear me down with the sweetness. Still a good brew though."
"And as far as drinkability goes, well, I could neither taste or smell the 10% abv, but I sure could feel it. A sneaky little bastard. Too sweet after a while, but overall a tasty concoction."
"VERY drinkable beer. The high alcohol content is not present at all making for a great beer."
"N'ice is nice. To be honest, the only other offering that I had tried from this brewery was La Chouffe. That was way too fizzy for me, so I went at this one a little gun shy. The first glass was a bit too cold so I let it sit. Too cold and this seems to have a little carbonation bite also. Once warmed the carbonation smooths out and the over ripened banana flavor and aroma is predominant. The the finish is a bit dry and a little bitterness attacks the back of the tongue. A spice flavor awakens as this one warms and, at 10 abv , I tought the alcohol was well hidden. I paired this with some homemade sweet dough bread and cheese and it turned out to be a good match. The bread and cheese combo mellowed out that slight bitterness and I ran out the next day to grab another bottle. A really nice seasonal brew."
"The mouthfeel was a little sharp, and while the drinkability wasn't bad it wasn't that great either. While this certainly wasn't a bad beer, it couldn't quite keep up with the Corsendonk Christmas Ale."
"The beer poured a rich reddinsh brown. The body is translucent, and the head was big and tan. The smell was heavy on the spices particularly the thyme. The taste was quite a treat as the spices blended for a very great tatse with a strong alcohol burn in the finish. The body was medium and dry. The beer was quite enjoyable and was a wonderful change of pace. I'm not sure I would make it a regular choice."
"2004 edition, capped not corked. Served into a chalice at cellar temperature, this pours a ruby mahogany body with tremendous carbonation action in the form of a horde of tiny bubbles in full flourish. The head is beige in color, and creamy in texture. Excellent retention, and exquisite sheet lacing drapes the chalice. Very tempting aroma features an orgy of overripe bananas, dates, apricots, and orangepeel, enhanced by spicy coriander, orangezest, thyme, and white pepper. Burnt candy sugar aromas add to the attraction. Mouthfeel is excellent, with effervescent carbonation as per style, and a smooth and creamy medium body that has both a spice and alcohol bite. Taste has the character of an orange liqueur, spiced with thyme and clove, and blended with pureed prunes and raisins. Lots of dark fruits stewed in rum, thrown into the middle. Toward the finish, it gains some dry and bitter hop and yeast character, as if some juniper flavored, Dutch Jenever was added to the mix. Very warming alcohol notes are in the dry aftertaste. An excellent Belgian winter strong dark ale. i enjoyed this one while watching a snow storm arrive on a cold winter eve and morn."
"750mL bottle poured into a snifter. It pours a deep ruby red color with three huge fingers of off-white head. There is a good deal of lacing left on the glass. The smell is very sweet, with lots of dark fruit like raisins and candied plums. There is some burnt caramel in there as well. The taste is also sweet. There's some brown sugar and molasses, with some fruitiness like fig or date. A hint of alcohol on the finish. The mouthfeel is decent, and the drinkability is pretty good for a 10% brew. A nice offering from Brasserie d'Achouffe."
"Froathy, crackling, light brown colored head disappeared quickly leaving tiny specs of lace. Hazy dark chestnut colored beer. Aroma of dark fruit, a bit of curacao, and some chocolate malt. Dark fruits and roasted malts up front followed by a strong alcoholic flavor and a slightly bitter finish. Overall disappointing. Too much alcohol in the flavor, and the whole thing just didn't seem to mesh."
"Love the painted bottle, need to find one of the gnomes for the yard. Dark brown body supports a big frothy head. Smells of cherries, and a little yeast. Strong alcohol presence in the flavor, but that goes away after the first few sips. Decent hop finish, no after taste, nice sweetness up front. Evaporates on the tongue nicly. great drinkability for a 10%-er"
"2003 edition. Pours with a chunky, russet-colored head that leaves what looks like entire coastlines of bubbly lace. Dig the lacing! The froth is bolstered by innumerable miniscule bubbles rushing past a few particles of sediment through liquid the color of stained cherry. Garnet highlights and vinous viscosity make this a looker for sure. First impressions in the nose are of freshly chopped coriander, though not overwhelming nutmeg and mallow. Fresh and leafy/botanical nosefeel somehow ends up suggesting... root beer! Must be the candi sugar. As the beer warms, I start detecting a smell like pink erasers--not unpleasant, but weird. Tastes strongly of root beer with tangy spices--mostly tarragon at first--but later the thyme starts to dominate the entire profile. The beer gets powerfully herbal, almost like bay; very round and bitter in the finish. Rather light on the palate, considering the strength of the spices. Alcohol is so well hidden that this is practically slammable. Probably best for knocking someone out before bedtime. At least that's what it did to me."
"The raw alcohol bitterness hurts the drinkability, but hey...this is a sipper anyway."
"This beer pours a nice dark brown color with a huge 4 finger head that falls to 2 fingers. The nose is spicey and a bit of alcohol. There is a touch of sweet figgy tones, as well, but not really deep. The flavor is nice, with a great spicey tone and lacking the alcohol from the nose. The sweet dark fruit tones balance really well in there as well. The beer is nice and thick. I would definately drink this beer again. Its another winner from the folks from Achouffe"
"Update: I like reviewing before I read the labels. The bright fruit I was tasting was definitely the curacao peel listed on the label. That explains it."
"Purchased the special edition 2004. The carbonation on this is in the ""holy shit"" category, foamed when I popped it and I had to pour it in stages to keep it in the glass. Nice dark brown colour thats red when held to the light with a ton of foam and a little lacing. Smells like brown sugar, some malt, oranges and some spices. Tastes similar to it smells with a sweetness presumably from the candi sugar coming through, with a nice spiciness to it and an orange zest aftertaste. Very fullbodied, and the 10% ABV is very well hidden. I think the drinkability on this is high, could easily finish off a 750 ml, probably another too. Drank it at the 60 degrees stated on the bottle, however I think it would have been a bit better if chilled a bit more. But definatly try this one if you can."
"Quite different....a huge and I mean huge thyme flavor. Almost so that it was making me gag. In the future I will be sure to taste before buying multiple bottles. Pass on the 2003...probably past it's prime."
"Drinkability: oh, hell yes!!!! I could easily drink this all day long, regardless of the ABV (assuming I don't have to drive anywhere)."
"It poured nice with a deep red, some say brown color. The head was tan, soft and fluffy. Lace was spotted but thick. The aroma was not strong but was of spice over alcohol. The taste left me in wonder, for I kept thinking it had a cola taste. After thought, perhaps its the thyme over citric spice backed by a sweet carameled malt. That may sound complex but thats what I got out of it. The mouth is left slick with like a hop oil glaze on the lip. The drinkability is smooth for this 10% abv brew. I thought the complexity made me think one bottle was enough for now."
"I've aged this beer for about a year in my cellar. The flavor was very well balanced. It didn't overpower with spice or malt like other Belgian strong ales I've had recently."
"Overall, I think I went into this beer with to much expectation. I'll try it again next season with a clear mind."
"When first poured the color was of a reddish amber brown with tan foam and some lace. The smell was very pleasant with a spicy aroma with a hint of citrus. Wow, the flavor had a smooth creamy, spicy taste with an orangy citrus flavor. After further sips, you could taste more of the thyme, hops and malted grains. I can't believe this ale is 10% alcohol. This is one smooth Belgium Ale with such high alcohol content. What a pleasant surprise. I need more of this special brew!"
"This offering poured a dark cloudy ruby color with big foamy head that quickly goes down leaving some lacing. Bubbles streamed up from the bottom. The aroma was a spicy wine-like aroma which tingled the nose. A sweet fruitiness and spice combined to form a complex taste. The thyme feeling sits on the tongue and is a little strange. The aftertaste had a dry cheese-like aftertaste. Mouthfeel was good, nothing too interesting. This beer is definitely a sipping beer as the alcohol content is very potent."
"This is my favorite winter beer. Vive la Chouffe indeed."
"The aroma was cherries, clove, brown sugar, and warm spices. The taste was tart-sweet (apples, cherries, pear) with a spicy (ginger, clove, nutmeg) kick. The mouthfeel was a bit thin, but was enhanced by explosive latent carbonation. This is quite a warmer due to the inherent alcoholic strength."
"Drinkability: An excellent winter warmer for those not shy about the higher ABV. This was so good, my wife and I drank up the second gift bottle that evening. Damn ;) ...gonna have to run back to the liquor store for a couple more."
"Was able to give this brew a chance the other evening. Had it on tap and it was poured to a very nice brown color that was quite clear and had a very sticky tan head the left chunky lacing at the top of the glass and nice rings down the side. The aroma was very spicy with a heavy malt scent. Was able to pick up highlights of orange/citrus, cinnamon, brown sugar to just name a few, it is an excellent smelling brew. The taste has a number of things happening. Highlighted by heavy malt and a hop spice flavor that ends with a warming alcohol taste. Over all this was a fantastic brew, glad I was able to get the chance."
"The mouthfeel reminded me of other fine Belgians with it's spunky but delicate carbonation. This is fine beer that I'd drink again anytime."
"Overall, slightly astringent."
"1/8-inch pillow of head at start, with stick and lace throughout. Glowing ruby hue with a pulsing heart and gentle haze undulating. Red grape fruit on nose with a hefty malt package and red, truculent red raspberry jam. Crammed malt efficiency slams at the front with a rounding plum retainer, like a court jester who is not only tolerated but called upon to perform. A finishing char of willow was not altogether uncalled for. This one is dangerously, munificently drinkable."
"It's nice, I dig it."
"This hazy brown beer has a gushing, light tan head. The aroma is full of old fruit like prunes, raisins and other dry fruit. With the bit of malt and the cinammon/nutmeg spiciness, it comes across like a funky old pie. The flavot is much like the aroma with the malt, fruit and spice melding into an interesting drink."
"The beer after disgorging from the 750ml dark green bottle sets in the glass a beclouded deep cherry red to almost brown color with the head creamy in texture with the color tan and the size portly, the lace forms a thick and sticky sheet to obscure the glass from view. Nose is sweet malt with a nice over ripe apple aroma, clean and fresh, also some yeast noticed after setting, start is sweet with a nice thick malt profile, the top moderate to almost full in its feel to the palate. Finish is iron-handed in its acidity, the hops pleasing and spicy, the aftertaste quite dry and long lasting, a nice drinking beer."
"Deep chestnut with medium head, low R&L. Phenolics are nice in the aroma, a little plastic but no higher alcs. Taste is of sweetened raisins, soft anise, no hops except in the balanced finish. A bit root-beerish. A little boring, but not bad. Finishes too quick. I have a feeling the bottled version would have better complexity."
"Sampled 2/1/04"
"Had on tap at Anam Cara. Served in a lovely Mc'Chouffe glass, with a little gnome keeping me company. Dark chestnut when served, it came topped with about an inch of tan head. Dried fruit aroma (like prunes or plums).Taste is interesting, it's a medium mouthfeel, the taste comes very quickly, and then it's gone. Finish is of malty sweetness with some fruit juice at the end. I wasn't blown away to be honest."
"A Belgian old ale? Certainly better than a previous example I've had. A fine beer, as all the Chouffes are, and I'd gladly have this one again, and maybe get lucky to find older vintages."
"2003 version. Dark brown color. Large foamy beige head. Aroma is malty and spicy. A full bodied Belgian strong ale. Malts are nutty and sweet. Spicy, with coriander, brown sugar and thyme being the most prevalent flavors. Its slightly sweet, yet there is a distinct mustiness as well. Hides the 10% alcohol very well. There is a touch of alcohol burn in the aftertaste, but thats all. Lively carbonation. Very cool painted/etched beer bottle. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is sweet."
"This dark brown beer is cloudy and has a spicy aroma. It is earthy from the use of thyme. It is still young and I think it would benefit from at least a year of aging. Still, if you are going to drink it while it is newly bottled, it is a good Strong Belgian Ale."
"Appearance: Clouded amber brown nice sized off white caramel head specks of lacing. Aroma: Dark candi sugar, alcohol tones running though it along with farmhouse spices and orange peels. Taste: Very herbal flavor with farmhouse spice amazing like Orval only bigger malts, sweet brown sugar and more alcohol phenols brewing here, great stuff. Mouthfeel: Medium bodied yet smooth and effervescent no rough edges to it. Drinkability: Completely incredible Xmas Belgian from the year 2002, that I will be on a lookout for years to come."
"Deep dark brown with a big off-white head, quickly fading. Big spicy aroma of cloves, thyme, cinnamon, a little hay-ish and definitely on the sweet take (caramel, toffee) with light notes of alcohol. Taste is more of the same original spiciness, very smooth altogether. I swear you taste the barley in there, siding sweet chocolate and candyish toffee. How belgians manage to balance their beers to avoid being cloying through spices keeps me in total awe. Slightly alcoholic finish. Creamy medium body, rather carbonated. Good, but I still prefer their Chouffe and McChouffe, so it's a mild disappointment."
"Drinkability: Definitely a bottle to share with someone else. An interesting mix of Samichlaus and Trois Pistoles, basically. Very hearty and warming. Don't know if I'll pick it up next year, but I certainly don't regret getting it this year."
"750ml. One of the better seasonals I've had. Some spices mixed in with a traditional Belgian style. ABV not noticed in the taste. Certainly a winter warmer, the flavor reminded me a little of the Anchor (almost an oatmeal cookie type of spice). Also, some of the coriander flavor I'm used to in Allagash. Not overly sweet. Year round, I wouldn't prefer a spice beer, but it is nice for the season (what season we have!)."
"2002 vintage. After reading the bottle, I was a bit let down that the spice was not more assertive in the flavor profile. The overall impression of the beer was that it was rather sharp. Caramel malt with some dark, slightly overripe fruit notes. A touch of nutmeg in the finish. Could have been a really good beer, but it seemed to lack something to give it a bit more ""umph."""
"Limited Edition 2003 75cl capped bottle. Poured a cloudy dark amber with a tight tan head. Spicy aroma with notes of orange, berries and candy sugar. Some light hops also detected. This smells like a quality brew. Head settles down, leaves scattered lacing. Mouthfeel is smooth, a medium body that has a crisp finish. This may be the best Belgian winter seasonal I've had yet. Flavor is not complex yet very drinkable and enjoyable. Alcohol not detected in flavor or aroma. A malty delight with flavors of sweet malt, candy sugar, citrus and belgian yeast. Thyme comes through in aroma as the warming process continues. This is an excellent winter ale, one to try if you haven't yet."
"I could certainly drink this all night. I wonder if the bottled version is this good?"
"Just plain solid. From the bottle with it's Hobbit type creatures to what is within, this is a great seasonal. Cellaring? If you count my stomach! Pours brownish red. The taste is candy, orangey and malt. Not overly sweet, just the right amount. An excellent beer."
"2002 edition. Poured chestnutty brown with frothy tan-colored head it the La Chouffe tuliped goblet. Top notch lacing, beautiful. Pruney, raisiny, malt aroma with a mix of mandarin zest and musty, yeasty notes. Smooth texture from the subtlized carbonation. Malty and rich; beautiful, soft spicing round out a nice sweet and sustained finish. So many flavors going on in this beer it's rather hard to describe. Spiced, candied dates with orange zest on them. Quite the delicacy of a winterbeer."
"2003 limited edition. Pours a dark cloudy brownish red with persistent carbonation and a soft white head. Aroma full a fruity esters. Apples, pears, some slight biscuity malt in the aroma. Taste is heavy on the spice and alcohol. There is some malt and a hefty dose of orange peel. Very heavy on the fruity esters. Alcohol warms in the finish leaving your tongue dancing. As with other beers from this brewery, it seems a little thin tastewise. Too much fruit & spice, not enough malt. This is a good warming belgian, but lacking in the ""meat & potatoes"" department. Soft dry mouthfeel and fairly drinkable at 10%. Worth a try, but not the best."
"Flavor matches the aroma with fruitcake and spices and a growing soapy taste that leads to a finish that has a long drying tannin like a chew on a cinnamon stick with a final warming alcohol through to the gullet."
"Highly recommended."
"This was supposed to be the last beer before starting the week off with a better diet... oops, that didn't happen. again. Anyway, the beer did happen, and it was quite tasty. N'ice Chouffe is a dark brown colour, very nice (n'ice?) It smelled a bit fruity, alcoholic too. Tasted fruity also, I didn't taste the alcohol too much actually, just a bit. The spices were different, I thought it was a great blend of flavours. Mouthfeel was good, on the thinner side and pretty carbonated, I could've drank more than the glassfull I had that night, definitely.. :)"
"This is another lovely brew from the Chouffe brewery in Belgium. A nice x-mas scene with the people of Chouffe village adornes this 750ml brown glass bottle that is crowned, but not corked. The pour yields a lovely dark reddish/brown liquid with a tan head of foam. Aromas of alcohol, fruits, spices, and malts/yeasts abound. The taste is lovely. Dry, fruity, boozy, and complex....a fine tipple on a harsh winters evening. The mouthfeel is very full, yet not cloying...and the drinkability is very good..."
"Easily my favorite Chouffe beer. I just have to get some to cellar before this winter is over, I can only imagine how this would taste with a year or two under its belt."
"The 2002 is good to go right away if you see it on the shelves of your local beer store. But dont believe the label hype about Cellaring  this beer is at its best around 2 years old and starts to head south after 3-4 years, sometimes quickly in my experience. It is better ""fresh"" I think."
"An interesting holiday beer, and a fine artisanal creation, though not as intriguing to my palette as it was for my brain. Didnt come together as nicely as each part is well on its own. Still tasty enough to be highly drinkable."
"The beer is wonderfully balanced and extremely complex. The curacao that they use in the brewing process ads a particularly inviting dimension to the ale. The fine Belgian yeast stands out in my mind as exceptional, and I really enjoy the way that the sweetness moves in and out of the flavor profile. This is an incredible beer!"
" Outstanding and unique."
"Barlet Wine Style, really? I thought it was a damn nice dubbel. Pours a perfect reddish brown, with a tan head that slowly faded to a 1/4 inch and held. Very nice lacing. The smell was that of sour cherries and spices, and tha taste matched, with a nice alcohol finish. Very warming as it went down, but not over powering. A spicey yet sparkling carbonated mouthfeel, with a dry finish. Very nice and for me, very drinkable. I was aware of the 10% alcohol, but the taste took over, and had quite a few. One of my favorite Holiday Ales."
"This was my New Year's Eve beer, served in a champagne glass of course. A pretty good way to end the year! Pours a dark reddish-brown with a medium thin light beige head. Lacing is pretty good. Aroma of herbs and berries. Flavor is a rich medley of fruit, alcohol and a little malt. Very good!"
"Brownish-amber in color with a huge off white head that lasts. Smell is mild with hints of something sweet. Spicy upfront then changes to something peppery in the end. Small hints of some deeper flavored berry as well. The alcohol is well balanced but still lends that warming feeling as you drink. Unlike any other Barley-Wine style ale that I have had but would like to try it again. Maybe after a year of aging."
"Dark brown with reddish hues, and somewhat hazy. Half-finger head. Aroma is subtle for the style, with mild spicy (thyme-like) and fruity (raisin, some apple) aromas. The flavor, however, is big malt all the way. Very sweet, with again some fruity notes mid-palate. Significant alcohol warming and a pleasantly hop bitterness, though not enough to stop the finish from being just slightly sweet. Medium bodied."
"Garnet hue w/ a light haze, covered by a light beige, fluffy, persistent, very dense head. A waft of sweetly herbal fresh thyme is perceived at first in aroma, then notes of citrus rind and mellow chocolate ensue. As the beer breathes, dark, fructose laden date and raisin like fruitness surfaces along with nostril tingling peppery alcohol. Malt becomes more pronounced as well, with dark caramel and hints of breadiness rounding the aroma out. A pleasure to inhale. Flavorwise, this beer starts out like a Belgian Dark Strong. Dryish, powered cocoa chocolate sweetness hits the palate at first, but this flavor profile takes a wild, but enjoyable turn towards herbs and citrus. Well calculated fresh thyme complements the slight raisiny, dark caramel malt foundation, and melds with both dried orange peel citrusy flavors and bitterness. Mellow chocolate malt is not far behind, then combines mid palate to leave a milk chocolate dipped, candied orange peel impression. Fruity esters are well integrated, being comprised of mild notes of barely ripe pear and plums. Light to medium in body, well attenuated, yet very smooth after the initally high CO2 level dissipates, with a deceivingly crisp, refreshing mouthfeel. Hop bitterness, although paltry, provides contrast to the mostly dark caramel malt derived sweetness. Finishes paradoxically dry, yet long and complex, w/ hints of clove, bread and butter simulatenously lingering. Delicious! This is the 2002 release... I can only imagine what a couple years of cellaring could do. N'Ice Chouffe is easily the most drinkable high gravity brew I've tasted. Deceptively soft all around. It's amongst the most complex beers I've had the pleasure of drinking as well, even this young. It's very unique, creative and satiating; like many other Belgians, however, it's potentially dangerous in drinkability. It seems that this brewery can do no wrong."

"This beer poured a very dark amber color and formed a foamy light tan head that left circular lace. A good deal of carbonation is present. An aroma of malt, caramel and raisins. A flavor of malt, toffee and raisins with hint of other spices. A finish that is a touch bitter and has the warming aspect of the alcohol."
"Pours a murky reddish-brown, with a huge, big-bubbled head. I had to wait for the head to settle on this on before beginning. Head faded quickly to a fine lace. Spicy and somewhat hoppy aroma with a big toffee malt presence with hints of grape and raisin. Vinous and bitter taste, with a spice presence and plenty of toffee and raisin flavors mixed in. Slightly dry finish, with a spicy and fruity aftertaste. Smooth and chewy mouthfeel. One excellent winter brew!"
"Quite impressive.  A real treat."
"The appearance is dark ruby.  A frothy head is present.  A bit of spice on the aroma.  Different in taste than most Barleywines I have tried.  A bit of a belgian slant to it.  Solid brew."
"Sorry had to give such a great beer a not so good review but this is the 96 vintage too and it is flat.Have had it before that was a 98 and was great so keep an eye out for that.Nice dark copper in color.Nice nose classic english style with a twist from the belgian brewing.Portish taste with great sweetness just wish I had some bubbles to go in it."
"Just found a bottle with a vintage date of 1996 on neck of the bottle. Dane from B. United told me a while ago to open it soon because it loses carbonation. He was right, now it has no carbonation at all. A shame really because this would have been a beer of greatness if it had only held on the carbonation. Goes down like a tawny port with fruity aromas and flavours of currants and cherries. Creamy mouth feel glides over the tongue, alcohol is warming but has mellowed for sure but still with a touch of peppery spice. Oddly there is barely any oxidation from the 6+ years of aging."
