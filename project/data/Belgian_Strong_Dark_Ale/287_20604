3.69,-2.1,3.75,4,3.5,3.5,3.75,"Hell Hath No Fury pours an extremely dark shade of brown - it's oily, with a hint of garnet, and almost black. In the context of this as a Belgian Strong Dark Ale, this is too dark for the style. The aroma also does not hint at its supposed style - I am picking up roasted malts, brown sugar, molasses, a touch of dark chocolate, and only the slightest hint of fruit esters one might expect. I am going to abandon scoring this beer within the confines of this style for the rest of the review, because it's clear to me that Bells did not intend to adhere to it so much. As for the flavor, I'm getting some dark fruit elements up front along with a sweet taste that's something along the lines of a 'Stella Doro' Italian cookie. The finish consists of bittersweet chocolate with much evidence of alcohol presence. Overall, this one tastes like it's not sure if it wants to be a Belgian Stout or a Strong Dark Ale... it doesn't excel at either point of view and it's not an interesting combination. Not a bad tasting beer by any means, but I would not buy it again.","Neorebel","Nov 16, 2014"

Medium mouthfeel with moderate to light carbonation. A touch bitter on the finish. Interesting, and not sure how to classify this one. It is unique, but a little weird.

Aromas of dark chocolate, molasses, raisin, banana, coffee, clove, toast, roasted malt, light pepper, herbal, and yeast spiciness. Damn nice aromas with good complexity, balance, and strength. Taste of dark chocolate, banana, raisin, molasses, clove, coffee, roasted malt, toast, light pepper, earth, and yeast spiciness. No bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of chocolate, molasses, raisin, banana, clove, roasted malt, coffee, light pepper, and earth on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice flavor robustness, complexity, and balance; with zero cloying flavors noticed after the finish. A bit dry on the finish as well. Medium carbonation and body; with a creamy and lightly slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with hardly any warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice Belgian style stout! Great flavor complexity, robustness, and balance; and very smooth to sip on. This was a very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Dec 15, 2012"

Initial notes of coffee and chocolate followed by some hops. As the beer warms the flavors become quite impressive. Mouthfeel is a little disappointing and toward the watery end for a BSDA. Adequate carbonation. Overall- A pretty good effort by Bell's on this brew. I was wanting a little more rich malty flavor but still was impressed.

2.87,-23.9,4,2,3,3.5,3,"I wouldn't have identified this at first as a Belgian ale--it's not mentioned on the bottle. Pours really dark, with almost no aroma whatsoever. The taste is fairly nondescript as well. Generally Belgian ales have a predominant yeasty flavor, but the roastiness and hops counterbalance it. Instead of complexity, though, this yields mostly just a sense of dryness. The mouthfeel is full bodied but not heavy, making this really drinkable. The main goal on this beer seems to be to hide the 7.7% ABV. It seems like a play on Duvel (Belgian for "devil"), which also hides the alcohol with a variety of flavors, but this beer is not nearly as interesting.","HeightsEats","Nov 04, 2011"

The smell was big and loaded with sweet caramel and roasted aromas. Couldn't get much in way of Belgian yeast aromas or anything like that. The taste of the beer was burnt but at the same time it was sweet and almost reminded me of a dessert. The mouthfeel was oily and had a low carbonation to it.

It would be nice to have a six pack of this to keep around in the fridge when i feel like one. If you like dark beers with Belgian yeast you should like this beer.

3.64,-3.4,3,4,3.5,4,3.5,"This pours almost black but not quite, with a small off white head that fades and leaves no lace. On the nose is a combination of BSDA and big stout notes: there is candy sugar and dark fruits, say prunes, but combining with that are some big roasted malts, dark green hop aromas, and just a little bit of alcohol. It's strange nose but for me it works well, not necessarily to style but quite good nevertheless. In the mouth, the balance shifts heavily towards the candy sugar and some estery notes, with the roasted malt providing more of an enveloping backdrop than a prominent flavor. The body is pretty big, and sometimes it almost borders on too sweet of a finish, but it never quite makes it to cloying. Overall, this beer is a bit of a mixup, and it's not bad, but to me it's out of balance.","EricCioe","Apr 02, 2011"

Licorice, toffee, cinnamon and spiced orange peel come next. You'd think that dryness would create more room for the herbal matter and earth but it sort of recedes here, more mineral water and dried straw instead. Yeasty but not bready, shy murmur of apricot, peach, apple fruit. Carbonation plays it lowkey, there when you look for it. Smooth finish leads easily to subsequent sips.","farrago","Jan 06, 2011"

The nose comprises rum, figs, raisins, cherries, cinnamon, chocolate, nutmeg, black pepper, clove, and a touch of black olives. The taste runs very similarly, though the spice reign slightly more supreme than the fruits, with the pepper, cinnamon, and clove really taking some firm control. Some light sourdough seeps in there as well. The body is a hefty-ish medium, with a light carbonation and a nearly chewy feel.

Overall, not as complex a taste as I would expect for the style or the brewer, but still a good, flavorful beer. A fairly light beer despite the dark color with nice, crisp carbonation. This one's definitely a sipper. All in all, a beer that's good enough to enjoy and share, but not one that will be the featured beverage of the night.","smithdc33","Nov 23, 2010"

Aroma is somewhat weak - there is some malty sweetness and spiciness there, but not much in the way of fruitiness or alcohol warmth one might normally associate with a Belgian Dark. Taste does not redeem the smell - some maltiness and peppery spices, and although the alcohol warmth does come through here, it comes on too strong (and 7.5% ABV is low for the style). Mouthfeel is medium bodied with high carbonation. You can taste the alcohol in this one and hampers its drinkability.

I get a spearmint gum aspect as well. The malt in this is sharp tasting, bitter chocolate, dates show up as well. Over all this is a very interesting take of a dubbel and I have to say I like it, quite a bit. One of the few beers lately to literally surprise me with how it tastes. Its Belgian in mouth feel and by way of the yeast character but the malts themselves are more American porter or stout in taste. The hops in this, if any are bitter and earthy, really only bringing out the malt as far as I can taste. Overall a very interesting brew I'd like to try again, and I will, five more to be exact.","Thur123","Oct 21, 2010"

Dark tan head that fades to a light lace which sticks around. Aroma of Belgian yeast and roasted malts is pretty straightforward. Taste is, well, unique. Sort of a blend between a Belgian strong dark and a stout. Lots of roasted flavors lead me to expect a healthy dose of roasted barley. There is plenty of flavor from the Belgian yeast as well. In the background is the carmalized, sugary flavor that I expect in a Belgian dark ale. There's lots going on, but it doesn't seem that well integrated to me. Mouthfeel is thick, and the carbonation is low and more stout-like than Belgian. Drinkability is good for the abv and the alcohol is well hidden.

A strong malt aroma of roasted and some cocoa overpower fruity, yeasty aromas but they are there. Taste is more of same which is slightly shameful as even though orange and dark fruit, as well a nutty yeastiness, make this a full-bodied and tasty sipper, it just has a little bit too much of a dry edge of burnt/bitter chocolate and roasted (even coffeesque) malt so there's just a touch too much of breadi-biscuitiness in the finish.

I should make a note that this beer does not fit the Belgian Strong Dark Ale style categorization. While the beer displays qualities of a Belgian-style yeast strain, I feel as though this is more an American Stout fermented with some funky yeast as opposed to an actual Belgian-style ale.

Very American in that, while it's clearly Belgian inspired, the yeast is still fairly clean (like the Sparkling Ale) and the malts control the flavor. That's not a bad thing, but this isn't an amazing Belgian. It is a nice sort of strong brown/porter-ish beer with hints of clove and cinnamon on top of the chocolate loaf and roast character that really defines and makes the beer. The aroma, while not much more than the flavor in terms of depth, is oddly intoxicating. I don't understand it, but while I might only want to drink one or two of these beers in a day, I could smell it all week. Go buy this beer, and then smell it.","tempest","Jan 04, 2009"

Pours a black color, with brown highlights and a small off-white head. No lacing. Nose is spicy candy Belgian malt, breadiness, light cherries and fruitiness. Much more roasted flavor than your average BSDA. Flavor is similar, and leans to the stouty side of things especially as it warms up.

The texture of the brew itself is smooth but not too thick allowing all kinds of complexities to appear in the taste from start to finish. Up front it's almost like coffee but tempered with the flavors of dark cherries.

The aroma is chocolaty, with notes of coffee, prunes, molasses and what reminds me of smoky bacon. The taste is dark fruits with raisins and plums up front, followed by coffee and bitter chocolate. There are also notes of smoked meats in the flavor profile. The mouthfeel is full and just a bit astringent.

It was slightly thick with moderate carbonation, and had a lasting bitter aftertaste with a bit of alcohol warming. Overall this was somewhat like a dubbel, but also somewhat like a porter, which was an interesting flavor but was a bit out of control. It had pretty good body and wasn't difficult to drink, but it could have been a bit smoother. I think a couple years of aging will really help the flavor pull together, and also help the body calm down.

And why is its experimental nature not documented so that we can understand these things in accordance with the process and the goals by Bell's? Am I overthinking this? Possibly. I like this beer a lot, mainly because even if he two styles I'm comparing it to are usually richer, this still maintains a lightness in flavors and mouthfeel that are ideal for making it able to be consumed in a session. A nice experience, and something I'll try again, but I think they could use the techniques from this process and make two unique beers from this, and those would have the potential to be great in their own right.","asabreed","Oct 21, 2008"

Full flavored, malty, earthy chocolate complemented nicely with a spice and tangy character. A good drinker, the 7.5% ABV is evident at the end of the mouth and in the swallow.

This is a nice looker here. The aroma is nice and fruity. I find a good bit of deep and sweet figgy notes with an estery banana and a hint of candied sugar sweetness. I like what is going on here. The flavor brings an interesting dichotomy of flavors. On one hand, it is slightly roasty and even a bit phenolic smokey and on the other it is estery, fruity and slightly sugary sweet. I'm not sure the two are blending well together for my taste, as the deeper roast and smoke are dominant over the other flavors. I was hoping for more raisin in there. The mouthfeel is very silky and moderate in body with no carbonation to speak of. I think a little bubble would have made the feel a little nicer to me. Drinkability is okay for this one.

Malt nose transfers over to the palate as dry roasted malt, dark fruits, plum, some bittersweet chocolate, and spicy hop for balance. Yeasty characters are more subdued than Id like, but what does come through is sour astringent that ends up tasting like cough syrup.

The aromas are fruity (strawberries and cidery apples) and a touch minty, with plenty of sweet candi sugar backing. On the tongue, a flash of bitterness gives way to a beer that is quite sweet, a bit cloyingly so, at first, with fruits coming out in a crescendo from the mid-palate to the finish. This beer has the same problem with sweetness that many American versions of Belgians do, namely that it's thickly sweet instead of, paradoxically, dryly sweet. Mouthfeel is a bit too thick for the style -- it's sluggish instead of full. For some reason, though, this beer is insanely drinkable. The ABV is well concealed and I find myself compulsively sipping this thing. Overall, this is a good American Belgian strong dark ale, but not something that can hang with the Belgian versions of the style.","geexploitation","Dec 27, 2006"

Surprisingly impenetrable pour of dark ruby, with a rim of tan cream. Flavor is a rich warm alcohol, with vibrant plum creams and bold charred currant sauce. The dark flavor of soy and burnt lamb skin seems a little heavy for the style. But, the sweet molasses character and rising bread notes create a marvelous symphony of fruit character. Elsewhere in the profile is an epiphany of alcoholic savory robustness that speaks of refined culinary detail. Far away, some lemongrass throws aside a cast of drying balance.

Flavor is initially sharp with a tart note this mellows to a creamy fruit and dark chocolate mix with soothing somewhat medicinal alcohol and ripe fruit combo fininish with a leafy herbal hop character and bready yeasty unfiltered as usual Bell's style. Mouthfeel has a fuller body that comes off slightly syrupy in texture and definitely has a sturdy flow of carbonation kinda tickles the back of the throat.

I didn't expect such a pitch black beer - looked more like a Russian Imperial Stout. Substantial roasted malt flavor with a solid hops/roasted bittering - I found myself wondering if this was more of a Baltic Porter. Full mouthfeel with moderate sweetness behind the bittering.

3.7,-1.9,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"D: It's nice to see Bell's is thinking outside of the American brewer box and trying this style. However, it seems to me to still have the character of an American brew. Whether this is a good thing or bad thing, I don't know. Overall, it is a decent beer, but not worth the price tag to me. Worth trying.","klewis","Oct 23, 2006"

2.4,-36.3,4,4,1.5,3,1.5,"One thing is for sure...this isn't even remotely a belgian-style dubble. It seems to me that they threw the Wheat Series yeast into a batch of Kzoo stout on accident, accidently knocked a bottle of Laphroaig 15 into it, and needed to get rid of the mistake. Blamo... Instant "dubbel". I sure am glad I didn't buy a six pack of this...I would have been pissed. I've never had a beer like this, and I'm not quite sure I want another. Rated as a beer, not to style (where as you would guess, it fails miserably).","Mitchster","Oct 20, 2006"
4.2,11.4,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Picked up a six pack at Andersons General Store and what a great buy. Poured aggressively a full body and very dark brown with a tan hue, creamy 3 inch head leaving a good amount of lacing and settlement on bottom of glass. Upon pouring the aroma of roasted coffee and malt hits your nose. I could smell a tab of licorice, cola and a light hint of alcohol. What I smell is what I taste. Very complex in flavor, starts off burnt caramel sweet with a roasted coffee, very slight licorice aftertaste and a light hint of alcohol. Full body, slightly syrupy and a soft carbonation give this brew a good drinkability and feel on the palate. IMO this is a great buy, I'm enjoying them and I highly recommend it. Great beer Bell's, Thanks.","GimpyCane","Oct 20, 2006"
4,6.1,4,4,4,4,4,"This beer poured a very dark tan that did not allow any light to penetrate it. It formed a dark tan foamy head that vanished quickly and left circular lace. An aroma of malt, chocolate and pepper with a touch of coffee. The flavor was of malt, chocolate with a bit of pepper and some spices. The medium body finished off with a slightly bittersweet finish.","Wildman","Sep 30, 2006"

Good looking beer served in a snifter. dark brown, chocolatey colored with a thin foam head. smells heavily of yeast and chocolate powder. taste is kind of Belgian like with some yeasty clove hints, but its also a lot like an oatmeal stout with roasted malt and chocolate flavors. I like it very much because its different from any other beer i've had and its very tasty. easy to drink as well.","aforbes10","Aug 05, 2006"

It very much reminded me a mythical blend of a rich porter with a dark belgium ale. Lot of dark fruit on the palate with enough hops in the finish to keep interesting and from being overly sweet. This is not the sort of beer I'd want to drink all the time (especially on a hot summer day), but this would be a great late fall or winter brew to sip before a warm fire. Another excellent beer from Bell's.","John_M","Jul 31, 2006"

3.73,-1.1,3.5,3,4,4,4,"Drinkability/Overall: No way in HELL is this a Belgian. As my comrade expatsteve iterated earlier, much more similar to a muted, less sweet version of Tyranena's Who's Your Daddy? imperial porter than anything Belgian. No fruity esters or dry yeasty finish in this one. No Hell, no Fury...just a mellow Daddy if anything. Still a tasty, gender-bender of a beer.","Golden2wenty1","Jul 24, 2006"
3.46,-8.2,4,3,3.5,4,3.5,"Drinkability: If this beer is hell, then it truly does have no fury. Very mild for a beer of this body and strength. Good easy drinking, but it's not a beer that blows me away by any means. I'm curious if Bells themselves designate this a Belgian Dark, as it really seems closer to a stout and even closer to a porter. Fans of those beers will be more impressed with this than people looking for a real Belgian style ale.","expatsteve","Jul 21, 2006"

3.86,2.4,4.5,3.5,4,4.5,3.5,"Had this on tap in Indianapolis, of all places. Came in a goblet type glass. It was pitch black with the slightest brown lacing. Very intense looking. The nose was gentle, you could sense the alcohol just a bit, with an earthy malt being the main smell. Taste was pretty complex, with a sweet coffee flavor and heavy malts, and some unidentifiable sweet fruitiness. The coffee wasn't bitter at all, and although it was the main flavor, it was subtle enough to allow the other flavors to surface. The alcohol was well hidden. Mouthfeel was excellent, very smooth but with good carbonation. Surprisingly drinkable, but watch out for the high ABV.","shivtim","Jul 09, 2006"

3.39,-10.1,3.5,2,4,5,3,"Sampled on draught @ Bells Eccentric Cafe in Kalamazoo, Michigan. Very dark brown color with a small and quickly diminishing white head. Quite dark, considering they call it a Belgian Dubbel. Really gentle aroma, with a light hint of molasses, chocolate and red fruit, but it is very subtle. Upon tasting, this is more like a Belgian stout. Really roasty, with molasses, chocolate and coffee notes and heavily yeasty, leathery tones. Light cassis and port wine flavors as well, though very light, considering they consider this beer a Dubbel. But, what makes this beer so special is its heavenly body. Its so creamy and thick and really brings out the flavors.","Crosling","Aug 06, 2005"
3.61,-4.2,4.5,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Everytime I go to Bell's I order up the same beers, but not today. After passing this one over many-a-time, today I decided to give it a try and I left feeling quite pleased although I'm sure the 9% the Fury packs helped me out. The beer poured an opaque black with a creamy, inviting tan head which faded to a small ring around the glass. The initial smell is roasted malts and coffee. At first the taste followed and then a cola-like sweetness developed about half way through. Not as thick as some of the others like Expedition (mmm!), but still a solid body on this one. The cola flavor also became evident in the smell as did a tangy sour extension to the roastiness. This probably won't replace any of my fallbacks, but was a nice change of pace today.","hoppymeal","Nov 03, 2004"
