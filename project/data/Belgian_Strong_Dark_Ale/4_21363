I got some dark fruits, like plum and cherry, along with caramel and a yummy bready base. Lots to like here.","TheElectricOne","Sunday at 05:10 AM"

In the taste, nice and malty, with candied nuts, cocoa, fruity wine, and dark fruit. The body is juicy, yet semi dry and has a rock solid carbonation earned from blending a portion from steel fermenters as well as barrel aging and blending. Overall, this is a winner.

The beer itself is an opaque dark purple brown color and leaves quite a bit of lacing on the glass. The beer smell has very strong wheat and barley smell that overtakes the other smells. The smell also has dark fruits and Belgian candi sugar notes underneath the malts. The barely smells a little burnt. The taste has the same notes as the smell but with a different intensity. The Belgian candy sugar and dark raisin notes dominate the taste while the barely shows up to take off the edge a little bit. The mouthfeel is heavy bodied with biting carbonation. The feel is slick. Overall, a pretty god beer and worth getting.","HattedClassic","May 28, 2014"

3.95,-7.1,4.25,4.25,3.75,3.75,4,"I’ll start by saying that I don’t like the Belgian yeast profile in general. There’s something spicy and funky about it that doesn't appeal to me. I’m definitely not a big fan of BSDAs. I wish I was though, then maybe I could enjoy this obviously good beer. The thing that I enjoy most is the aftertaste, where vanilla, oak, and a general warmth stick around for quite a while. Up front it’s a very satisfying sweet, grainy, spicy flavor profile. I am not a fan of the finish. Bitter funk dominates. So, between the front and the aftertaste, the stuff I don’t like about BSDAs really comes out. If you like BSDAs you’ll probably love it. I don’t know. A satisfying experience however. I drank it, so that definitely means its good. Some of the lamer BSDAs I can’t even finish. I probably shouldn't even be reviewing this beer.

A roasted malt aroma first hits me, like coffee and toffee with a touch of bready toast and there's this sense of caramel and dark cholocate and syrupiness in the aroma as well, but not much in the fruit or hops department. Real smooth, creamy, thicker medium-bodied beer that has sweet notes abound like vanilla java, chocolate, caramel, some toffee, I swear some sweet fruit notes are evident. Great balance with roasted malts so it's not too sweet and has an edge, especially in the finish but not an ABV bite. Some woody or oakiness help smooth it out as well and make you want to keep drinking this beer. Not much else in terms of fruit flavors or hops, so I found this (and in no way is this a detriment) sweeter than your average belgian ale with less of that citric orange peel flavor you can expect. Overall, a must try for beer lover.","clayrock81","May 05, 2013"

A steady flow of small, tight carbonation throughout the body of the brew. This looks tasty. Aromas of rich, dark sweetness in the background, including dates and raisins. A subtle grain overlay on the nose balances, with some nut sweetness revealing, also. Flavors are bold and smooth initially, with a blast of rich, old world fruit sweetness (date and fig) followed by a grainy and toasted wheat character that brings a touch of sharpness and cleanliness to the palate. Very balanced. The more you drink, the more you can pull from the palate, with some tart grape sweetness and hints of smoke and char. The dynamics of the flavors keep the elevated ABV from being blatantly recognizable, but there is a subtle warmth that builds as you drink. Nutty and sweet aftertaste, with a decent linger to it, leading to a slow, light, and slightly sweet finish. This is a great beer.","GarthDanielson","Apr 29, 2013"

The taste brings in more of the same, though now the berries are less tart, everything is generally sweeter, and some strong notes of oak make themselves more than known. The body is a lithe medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a drying finish. Overall, an alright beer, but one that just seems too scattershot, too schizoid, to be truly effective to my tongue.

Of all the aspects of a beer, I’ve found that American brewers have the hardest time finding the right Belgian mouthfeel. Drinking this beer was a truly wonderful experience. I can’t give a beer a perfect 5, but this is very, very close. It stands up with some of the best Belgians out there. This is a must try.","BlackBelt5112203","Feb 16, 2013"

Aroma of caramel malt, dark fruit and light oak. Unusual flavor of caramel malt, dark fruit, wood, and an odd astringent bitterness up front. Caramel and wood middle and finish with the same light bitterness. The bitter spicing and high alcohol make it appear somewhat medicinal, but this is very complex and well balanced.

Smelled of sweet dates and dark figs. The first sip was a surprise. Tasted of coffee with hints of dark chocolate and dark fruit with slight wood notes. Creamy mouthfeel. The alcohol was well hidden.

Some hints of toffee and the sweetness is palpable on the nose even before you taste. It had a nice medium body and mouth feel -- not too light or too heavy. Doesn't have a ton of bitterness, but just enough to remind you that you're drinking a beer and not Malta or a bourbon. I bought a bottle at the brewery over the summer of 2011, cracked it open for the holidays that year. Lets hope they still have some when I head back up this summer -- might be my favorite Allagash brew.","TerrenceOBrien","Dec 30, 2011"

4.8,12.9,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,5,"Pours a dark, dark brown color with a beautiful chocolate/cocoa colored two finger head. Excellent lacing on my snifter glass. This brew is impossible to see through, even when held to light. Great looking beer. In the nose I get: fig, tobacco, bourbon, oak, clove, and other dark fruit. Pretty smooth, and warming helps tremendously. Not quite up to the best Belgians, but it's REALLY close. HOLY CRAP. This is one amazing tasting beer! I definitely get caramel/toffee, w/ the fruits, slight bourbon, but this isn't boozy at all. In fact, I don't detect any of the 10.4% alcohol in this beer. It just gets better and better the more it warms too. It's super smooth, silky, and feels like a million bucks in the feel department. The only ding I can give it is that I'd like the feel to be a little more full bodied- but that's grasping at straws. Overall, this is an amazing brew and I recommend you buy it immediately if you see it for under $20/750ml... Cheers!","jayhawk73","Oct 28, 2011"

The beer poured out as a nice dark brown color. There was a light lacing from the white head on the glass. The smell of the beer had some wheat, fig and wood aromas going on in there. The taste pulled all those things to gether with the addition of a minimal tartness and a hint of grapes or raison. The mouthfeel was pretty good, it had a decent carbonation it and it had a steady medium body as well. I'm glad I tried this one because I ended up liking it more than I expected to.

The taste was sweet first, dissolving to spiciness, and a very dry finish, which left me cottonmouth afterwards (a little too much so). Impressively, no hint of the alcohol content. The feel was very smooth and full-bodied, with very little carbonation. A pleasant flavor mix, but the cottonmouth after-effect had me reaching for another offering after downing this one.

I really don't pick up much else which is disappointing. The taste does have the traditional BSDA flavors. Dark candi sugar sweetness, honey, dark fruit, carob, and clove. I do detect vanilla and tobacco which gives the beer a nice earthy flavor. The sour oak flavor pops through in the end. The feel is light to moderate with very airy carbonation; makes me want to burp a lot. Sweet throughout with a touch of sour in the end. ABV is ridiculously well hidden, dangerous.

The beer builds on a clean grain flavor with big caramel/brown sugar and fruity malt notes, raisins and plums. There's some definite dark malt presence, as well. Chocolate and light coffee add some very interesting touches. Lots of oak and definite bourbon (better than Curieux but still a tad odd, in my opinion). Carbonation is relatively light.

Huge notes of figs and dates, toffee, a bit of chocolate, oak, green apple, and sweet raisins. The flavor is a explosion. This could well be the most flavorful Belgian style beer I've ever had the opportunity to try. Wow, just amazing. Up front comes silky toffee with a hint of 80% dark chocolate. Figs and dates, raisins, fresh uncharred oak and sour pie cherries. The flavors are so independent yet blend flawlessly together. It's like a puzzle where each piece is a different color. Amazing. The mouthfeel is silky smooth, leaving an explosion of flavor lying on the palate. Overall this could be the best American take on a Belgian style (minus 1 or 2 American Saisons) that I've ever had.

It's an opaque beer; I can't see inside of it to detect any rising carbonation. There isn't much aroma that I could detect. It's a little musty and a little fruity. There may be some lime or cranberry notes; whatever it is, it reminds me of juice. It's a very dry beer with lots of yeast and wheat but not too much malt or hop flavor. There is a slight touch of sour and a hint of chocolate. It feels super crisp and dry. There are lots of tiny bubbles to be felt as well. It leaves a neat coat behind--I can only describe it as crumbly, like how your mouth feels after eating a dry cracker. It's a very different sensation for a beer to provide.

This works wonderfully with the incredible creamy smoothness in the mouthfeel. i really couldn't detect much alcohol at all, which is amazing for a 10% beer.

Allagash Odyssey comes out a nice dark brown, with lovely ruby hues at the bottom of the glass. Not much heading, but a decent amount of lace sticks around. Nose is nice mix of dark fruit....figs, dates, plums, things of that nature. The plum character really shines through in the taste, with the bourbon also coming in to compliment things. Mouthfeel is beautifully balanced, and one of the beer's best characteristics. It has a fairly large body, but does not come off overdone at all. Drinking this is far too easy. It is tough not to chug this stuff.

Rich, cocoa and wood aroma. Slightly smoked, some tobacco, and some leather, but not nearly enough to overwhelm the softer fruits and malt. Velvety mouthfeel with low carbonation and a long finish.

The beer tastes way strong, sweet and estery, maybe some real fruit was steeped in here, plums or figs or something similar, a little roasted malt, and some burning alcohol holds it all together.

Huge fruit, chocolate. Raisins and prunes again, and stronger oak than before. Some dirtier roasted malt in there too. Really an absolutely delicious beer.

There was very little head from this pour, though my buddy's glass had more head. The lack of head was disappointing, but there was lacing that continued to form around the glass, a detail I particularly love. I was a bit cold when I was drinking this, so the smell was moderately hidden from me. As I warmed up the smell became more noticeable, it had a powerful sort of smoky, wooden quality to it that was truly wonderful. The look of the beer is a dark brown, in which I could see my reflection perfectly in the glass. If I could draw, I'd do my self portrait in this beers reflection. This beer is the perfect sipper! I found it actually amazingly difficult to put down; I just couldn't put it down. The play between the yeast, malts, mixed in the oak barrels is just amazing. A lot of beers have been brewed in oak barrels before, but not at the level of expertise that Odyssey was.","FernMaster","Oct 09, 2009"

This said, there is a lot of sugar in this beer, it was almost surpy in consistency. Definetly a great beer, one of Allagash's finest.

All in all, though, this one's very nice, benefits from the barrel aging, and is something I'd be glad to try again. I will say that it probably doesn't merit the price I normally see it going for (~$15-18), so I'm very glad I got it for $11 at Green's, always the best value for beer in the South.","CrellMoset","Jul 07, 2009"

It tasted like rich roasted barley and creamy yeast and oak, with some molasses and coffee. Surprisingly malty without as much hops or wild Belgian yeast. It was watery with some smooth carbonation, and had a mild bitter aftertaste. Overall this was an excellent beer. It was delicate but robust, and was very smooth and easy to drink. It was a bit hot, but the alcohol wasn't too strong. It would probably age very well. All in all I had no complaints about this beer, other than I wish it wasn't quite as expensive.

Plum and raisin and chocolate and just an amazing collection of sweet and earthy flavors with the oak just sort of mellowing or melding the flavors together. For such a big beer the alcohol was not discernible and the mouthfeel was remarkably smooth and creamy. I wasn't sure what to excpect, but I know what I got.

I tasted the alcohol heat and some esters, oak, tart hops, citrus rind and bitter coffee all punctuated by a spiciness. Similar to a cognac.

A slight sour note on the finish. A bit thin in the mouthfeel department, slick in the throat. Drinkability is good, but this one is way too sweet to have more than one. Overall a great brew by allagash. I would like the mouthfeel and texture to be a little bit thicker, but they are quite good as they are.

The mouthfeel seems to change, it starts out thick and glyceryne like and then the tight carbonation gives it a nice dry finish. The flavor of the burbon really hits at the finish.

4.28,0.7,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,"Bottled January, 2008- cases bottled, 600. I bought this from Decatur Wine and Spirits. Definitely could use some aging. It is pretty tasty right now, but the taste of new oak is pretty strong. If you like that, drink it now. If not, age this for a year or more. Since I've never had it before, I couldn't wait and decided to try it fresh. Pours as about a dark a brown as you can get before shifting to black. Fairly thin head, but there is barely any head fading. The whole cap sticks around for the life of the beer. There is also some spotty lacing. Smell is oak dominated, with some subtle typical Belgian strong dark notes of raisins, candi sugar, toffee, and spice in the background. The taste becomes more integrated as the beer warms and opens up, but there is still a lot of new white oak in the flavor. Spicy oak notes, woody, vanilla, and quite a tannic bitterness that echoes through the whole thing. At this point, the raisin, prune, candi sugar, and toffee play second fiddle to the oak bomb. That being said, as with a great wine, the early oak and tannins predict greatness in the future of this beer. With some aging, these components should mellow and become more seemlesly integrated. Also, although the oak is prominent, the tannins are the star, and this beer is not a vanilla bomb. This makes the whole flavorr profile more complexx and interesting. Mouthfeel is full, creamy, and quite tannic. Challenging and complex. The alcohol is eextremely well hidden and as big in flavors as this beer is, it is still a pleasure to suss out the various components of this brew. A prime candidate forr cellaring.","Georgiabeer","Feb 28, 2008"

Toasty malt and toffee were prominent, with some vanilla, oak and booze following. A little buttery smelling too. Mellow bitterness with a fruity backbone, flavours of figs and other dried fruits were quite forward. Sweetness was similar to brown sugar or molasses, a little buttery with a bit of alcohol in the finish. Low carbonation, creamy bubbles and medium bodied with a bit of dryness and warmth, plus a bit of stickiness. This stuff is dangerously easy to drink.

The smell is primarily the bourbon aging/vanilla that all but masks a fig-like dark fruit and light roast malt aroma. Medium body with a heavy bourbon character and a nice light carbonation to the mouth. The bourbon aging contributes to a spicy finish that lingers significantly. I didn't realize that its a wheat ale. I imagine that contributes to the drier, verses fruitier character. I really had a good time with this one. A lot there to consider.

On the palate, rich and perfectly balanced flavors mix with excellent carbonation and smooth barrel-derived tannins. Very creamy in mouthfeel and flavor, along with some slightly sweet nutty, coffee and cream notes and slight twang of acidity. Some alcoholic hotness, but it serves mainly to activate the other flavors and lengthen the finish rather than distracting you. Overall, this is a great beer, and one of the better barrel-aged Belgians I've had. The oak barrel notes aren't too sweet, too forward, or too cloying; instead they just add some great nutty and vanilla-y notes to an already tasty Belgian brew.

3.16,-25.6,4,3,3,3,3.5,"Bottle (February 2005 drank in January 2006): Poured a deep ruby color ale with a quite large off-white foamy head with better then average retention. Aroma of alcohol is detectable with some sweet malt. Taste has definite bourbon presence with some semi-sweet malt. Body is definitely thinner then expected. I was expecting a bit more complexity from this beer  no yeast signature, alcohol taste too evident, thin body.","Phyl21ca","Jan 13, 2006"

4.72,11.1,4,4.5,5,5,4.5,"750 mL, corked and caged. Bottled February 2005, 10.4% abv. Glowing mahogany with garnet highlights and a clinging, sand-colored foamy head. Aromas of figs, dried cherries, and prunes, all soaked in vanilla- and orgeat-infused bourbon. Fluffy and light mouthfeel supports a roasted almonds and vanilla bean/date sugar sweetness. Spicy alcohol emerges right before a dry, sugared filbert finish. Brilliantly balanced and highly drinkable for such a rich and full-flavored ale. I can't wait to see what another year or so will do to this. Delicious.","orfeu","Jan 04, 2006"

Definitely could smell oak and vanilla. The oak seemed more pronouned then others have noticed. To me this didn't have the mouthfeel of a Strong Dark Ale. Didn't really notice the alcohol. I brought this to our neighborhood New Year's Eve party as I'm the beer geek in my neighborhood. I thought this was my chance to convert some of them Mick Light drinkers. We had started with a St Bernardus Tripel, which every one enjoyed. "Wow, this stuff is really good, what else did you bring?" Unfortunately, the Odyssey didn't go over that well. Maybe it was the oak, but I was underimpressed, as well. Not a bad beer, but not great.","doubleipa","Jan 03, 2006"

Smell is underwhelming -- expecting more -- just hints of vanilla and oak/bourbon with alcohol spiciness. Taste has the base notes of a dubbel acccented with the expected vanilla and oak flavors -- not much else going on. Pretty good mouthfeel and at 10.4% this is a very drinkable beer -- the ABV will sneak up on you. However, the verdict, unfortunately, is that this is less of an Odyssey and more of a (pleasant) three hour tour. Gilligan!","stephendedalus","Dec 26, 2005"

Instead, it's a complimentary note to a soothing sonata of malt, yeast and muted spice. the ABV is bold and brash, but is balanced nicely with the muscular-enough flavor profile. The result is a potent but quite drinkable brew. The bottom line is a bold, well-crafted big beer, and it's well worth every breath you take, every move you make, every sip you take.","Foxman","Nov 21, 2005"

4.27,0.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,"Bottled Feb 2005. Great pop on the champagne cork unveiled an amazing nose of oak, peaches, rum, raisins and booze. It poured dark, thick with a nice lather. I took a small sip and it felt like I took a big swig. Huge flavors of oak and bourbon in a rich creamy ale. The sweetness is one of vanilla, peaches and honey which helps balance some of the alcohol burn. This is a serious beer. If you like what Ive described then you will love this but it isnt for everyone. I was going to ding this beer on the drink ability. After I few sips I thought I would only drink half a bottle but after drinking 3/4 of the bottle I wanted more. Once it warmed, a great ale shined through. It paired great with blue cheese and aged Gouda. Thanks to Jetsbeer.","lou91","Oct 08, 2005"

Streaky and clumps of lace coated the glass for the most part. Sweet candy sugar and big dark ripe fruitiness hit my nose first. Good amount of spiciness was there as was a bit of dark chocolate. Light alcohol notes as it warmed, very delicious smelling. Taste has a big fruitiness up from with figs and plums with some brown sugar sweetness. A mix of spices is in there but I cant pick any out. Caramel, oak and some bourbon notes all mix flawlessly adding to the incredible taste. As it warmed the alcohol showed its face more but never added negatively to the flavor. One of the best tasting Belgian Dark Ales I have ever had. Pretty thick and creamy body with a bit of a warmth to bit due to the big alcohol. Ridiculously drinkable. With as strong as the alcohol is and the complexity in this brew it went down very easy and I wish I had another bottle to follow it with. Excellent stuff.","meathookjones","Sep 22, 2005"

It has a wicked malty scent that boasts of roasted and crystal malts along with a deep whiskey aroma. There is quite a bit of warmth and complexity in the aroma. The taste is great. It has a warming whiskey flavor that is complimented with a complex malt bill. It's roasted and full of Belgian crystal malts; very tastey. The mouthfeel is near perfect. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a damn good beer. The whiskey barrel storage is a great idea. It really adds a whole new flavor to an already solid brew.","WesWes","Sep 11, 2005"

I get rum-soaked raisin, light vanilla, puffs of alcohol, and spiceyness. Wow. Lots going on, but not over the top. The flavor is pretty darn nice. Ny initial taste gave me the impression that it was going to be boring. Just a spicey alcohol-enhanced raisiney fig flavor, but I gave it a minute to show me the full potential. The finish is not as sudden as other brews. It took a good 10 seconds to hit, but the woody, slight vanilla, but mostly just a wood flavor, comes through and lingers. I like it. The feel is a solid moderate with a light to moderate carbonation. I do get alcohol in the flavor and in the nose, but its not offensive. It enhances the experience. For this size and the complexity of nose and flavor, the drinkability is very good. I like it a lot better than the Curieux.","kmpitz2","Jul 05, 2005"

Lots of oak character at the end. The alcohol isn't very prominent in the flavor, but it is very warming. Also some fruity sweetness on the finish. The mouthfeel is on the heavy end of medium.

Taste was good. Started out with an assualt of vanilla and honey on the palate, which then mixed with some fruit, and a few hints of spices shine through which made it balance nicely.

There is vanilla, a little date from the malt, a hint of earth/soil, and a touch of bourbon. The taste is much richer. There is a sweetness of dates and figs up front followed quickly by vanilla, and a bourbon character. The hops show in the middle of the flavor with some orange/citrus.

There is alcohol in the nose if you really go after it, but it really isn't fuming with it [keywords: good balance]. The taste is like ripe plums, skin and all.. it starts out with a full on sweetness and finishes with a dry, tart astringence. Although this is a drinkable brew, I think you could easily split a 1 pint 9.4 fl oz bottle between two (or more) people, especially with dinner.

4.35,2.4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Allagash's Odyssey burst forth with a richness and complexity that could be likened to an overladen rain cloud dumping itself across the cold dessert floor as part of a fast moving electrical storm at night. It's black body reveals glints of burgundy beneath its inch-high creamy ivory head; and the retention is quite nice, leaving short walls of almost completely solid lace that slowly erode to spots and splashes as you progress through the glass. Vanilla, dark caramel, raisins, and oak greet you in the nose along with some black licorice, a spritz of alcohol, a drizzle of dark chocolate syrup, chickory, some mild brown sugar, and the suggestion of cold black coffee. It's medium bodied and zesty in the mouth before warming to become somewhat airy. The flavor is even more intense than the nose suggests with the addition of some previously hidden yeasty fruitiness and spicy phenolics; and more dried dark fruit. As it warms, it rounds out quite a bit as the alcohol sinks down into its supple maltiness. Roastiness remains in the finish, but it also softens quite a bit as it's awash in dull dark fruit, alcohol, and soft, sweet vanilla. It's enjoyable for sure, but it's 10.4% abv does slow down its drinkability!","NeroFiddled","Apr 04, 2005"
