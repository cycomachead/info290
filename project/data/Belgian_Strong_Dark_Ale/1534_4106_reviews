"Overall, not a bad strong dark ale."

"An enjoyable beer that proved easy enough to drink but in truth didn't really strike me as a memorable offering or one that I'd be all that likely to go back to in the future. There was nothing wrong with the beer as such, it just seemed to be missing that special something that would have found be rating it higher. This was partially down to the beer following a fairly predictable pattern from nose to taste with the ripe fruits and sweetness staying consistent throughout; a decent beer but there are better Belgian offerings out there to be had."
"O: It says that is the best dark beer of the world, I almost cound´t finish it due to it´s overwhelming sweetness."
""
"Dark red/brown colour, weak head. Smell: cherry, plums. Taste: cherry, plums, red wine. Very malty and sweet, almost no hops. No match to blue Chimay or Rochefort 8 (painfully sweet for me), but I can understand why some people like it."

"An excellent Belgian Strong Ale. It pours a dark ruby color, with a\ nice creamy head and some lacing. As the brewery notes mention, it is a maltier beer, with a hint of spice and fruit. The 8.5% ABV is hidden very well and not particularly noticeable in the taste, only your head."

"This is classically delicious and a real joy to sip on. Well worth the price I paid for it."

"Smell of fresh barley, hay, honeycomb wax. Copper, red, dark orange, foam dense and persistent. First taste tobacco, chocolate, coffee, malt. Resembles top quality rose wines and finest single malt whiskeys. Only minus is to much sweet and caramel. Strong, tasty looking for heavy food, or it can serve as glass before sleep."
""
""
"O- Yum. The malty notes in this are fantastic. Molasses caramel, and the depth of this beer is great. Temp change brings more intense flavors out. Very nice."
""
""
""
""
""
"Excellent beer combining rich spices and fruits notes. Sweetness that does not bother. Very easy to drink, I remember to taste it while I was adventuring in the world of craft beer, and still tastes great."

"Poured a dark brown body with one finger head that never really goes away thanks to a lace ring. Aroma has dark fruits everywhere with figs, raisins, black cherries, and there is also a sugary sweetness in the aroma like toffee or candi sugar. Very smooth, creamy, sweetness from caramel, toffee, candi sugar, the smoothness is from a good yeast presence, creaminess from great balance with dark fruit flavors like black cherry and raisins (not going to say plums) and finishes oh so easy. Maybe too sweet for some but hit the spot for me."

"Great Belgian yeast esters, with enough malt sweetness and vinous character to balance. A real treat."

"330 ml bottle into chalice, bottled on 12/12/2012. Pours slightly hazy/cloudy deep ruby brown color with a 1 finger dense khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of huge raisin, prune, fig, apricot, pear, apple, caramel, molasses, candi sugar, toast, clove, brown bread, herbal, light pepper, and yeast earthiness. Incredible aromas with great complexity and balance of malt and fruity/earthy yeast ester notes; with good strength. Taste of big raisin, prune, apricot, fig, pear, apple, caramel, molasses, toast, brown bread, candi sugar, clove, light pepper, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Lingering notes of raisin, prune, apricot, fig, pear, apple, caramel, molasses, toast, clove, brown bread, light pepper, herbal, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice complexity and robustness of dark malt and fruity/earthy yeast ester flavors; with a great malt/yeast flavor balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a moderately creamy, smooth, and lightly slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is an awesome Belgian strong dark ale! All around great complexity, balance, and robustness of dark malt and fruity/earthy yeast ester flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the ABV. A highly enjoyable offering."
""
""
""
"Beer is medium-bodied, with carbonation of medium-low intensity, leading to a slightly foamy (1/4) and otherwise smooth (3/4) mouthfeel that is just right for the beer and within stylistic guidelines. Ethanol slightly perceptible as a slight warmth on the palate, but no other indicators. Closes dry, with heavy stickiness clinging to the palate."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is a really good beer.I wouldn't say it's nearly as good as the Blauw, but I would recommend it."
""
""
""
""
"Would have again; a nice approachable example of a strong dark Belgian."
"Overall: This is a nice example of a strong dark Belgian ale. Not too intimidating for newcomers but also not shy on the flavor. This is a really good beer."
""
"Overall 4.0: While off a bit in certain areas, this beer is -nonetheless-- outstanding. Excellent tasting and a unique type of Belgian style, what with its low level of bubbles. Highly enjoyable, fully sessionable and I can certainly see why this has been brewed continuously since 1471."
""
""
""
""
"Overall - This is a bit light side for the style and I like it."

"Pours a two finger khaki head that fades quickly leaving a no lace. Dark opaque brown color, ton of yeast left in bottle. Good carbonation and medium bodied. Dark fruit nose and flavor is dark fruit and spice. Better flavor as it warms. Higher ABV is hidden. 330ml bottle part of 4-pak $18.99 Julio's Liquors Marlboro, MA."
""
""
""
"Poured from a brown 25.4 oz. bottle. Has a cloudy dark brown color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is bursting with dark fruits, some yeast present, mouth is watering. Taste is very complex, some sweetness, spice, lots of fruits, mild alcohol, excellent and delicious. Feels full bodied in the mouth and overall is a top notch beer worth seeking out."

"O- The cap and bottle on this beer claim this beer could age for a lifetime, after opening e bottle up after at least 20 years after it had been bottled I can definitely say that is probably true. The beer definitely showed its age but still remained a tasty treat that I thourghly enjoyed trying and would definitely try again if I ever get the chance."

"Overall: an exceptional, exceptional beer. Full flavoured and super complex, with just the right amount of each flavour jockeying for favour. Hands-down one of the best beers I have ever had. The only thing holding me back is the AU$140+ per case price (2013), but even at this price I believe it is worth it. Just have to make it a special occasion. Damn peasant wages - I'd love to have this one regularly."
"O-This beer may never win any first-place prizes in the BSDA category, but it is drinkable and packs a decent punch of flavor. As noted above, it is a tad rough and vegetal, but I kind-of enjoy the rustic aspect. It would go great with some pate and cheese on a cool evening."
""
""
"O: Excellent. Not sure why I held onto this single for so long, because I'm really digging this. Very flavorful and sweet, yet approachable and balanced enough. Fantastic dessert beer, and I wish I had more than a single of this."
""
""
""
"Food match: Dessert, and cheese, or both (cheesecake). Either or in the case of this brew, though perhaps leaning towards dessert due to the sweetness."
""
""
"O- This would be great on a cold winter night. I will be buying this again."
"O - I've had the classic many times over as I have with all the Gouden Carolus ales. Probably my favorite Belgian brewery and stuff like this is why. This has a lot of the same similarities of the Keizer Blauw but not quite as hefty as its brother's Abv. Still a Belgian dark racked with loads of excellent flavor and quite possibly the smoothest ale of its size in the Belgian craft world. This is MasterCrafted stuff and if there ever was such a thing as a Belgian Brown ale this would be the one. I'll continue to drink these on a regular basis. One of my favorites"

"O: A very good beer with a strong fruit character, a fair amount of sweetness and some spice. A good example of the style."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Superb Strong Dark Belgium Brew – one of the best I’ve had."
""
""
""
"Anyway, the Gouden Carolus Classic is a GREAT way to end our line of beers from Het Anker. Cheers!"
""
""
"MF – A bit minerally, moderately dry, moderate carbonation, a smooth start with a slightly warming finish."
""
""
""
""
""
"Hits the mark for its style, but within that category is above average."
""
""
""
""
"Overall – The chocolate and coffee flavors were a little odd in this brew and took away from the nice blend of fruit, malt and rum tastes. Not bad, but not the best Belgian strong dark out there"
""
"This is very easy to drink. A satisfying malt-forward dark ale. Offers a really smooth flavour profile with dry dark fruits and some interesting malty esters with quite a low bitterness. It is quite well executed. Probably not my favourite but still a very nice and interesting beer that is worth checking out."

"Serving type: bottle"

"Overall this is quite good, but not totally my style. The burned notes and heavy peach get to be a bit too much for me. Good balance though, and very drinkable."
""
""
""
"What an amazing beer. I was so surprised by its appearance and once I took a sniff and then a sip, this beer got me. Also, extra points for being so widely available, without having to chase it around. I'll make sure to grab a couple just for cellaring."
""
""
""
""
""
"The taste starts out with sweet malts and sugar followed by a peppery finish that lingers for a short moment. Alcohol is well-integrated into the beer. I enjoyed this one."
""
""
""
"alcohol is masked but packs a punch, nice rounded fruity flavor, i liked it because it wasnt overly sweet."
""
"APPEARANCE: A light cream colored foam that disappears almost completely and very quickly. It can be served at one time without fear of overflow. Leaves no traces on the top of the vessel. Nice dark amber color. AROMA: Very soft, very subtle, but remember that you know nothing. Pleasant. At some point there comes a slight odor of alcohol and roasting, especially as it warms. TASTE: Slightly creamy. Mild and pleasant. Nothing to do with the Rochefort 8. Hugely better. Among drinks, the taste, the presence of the beer is in the middle of the tongue and palate, unlike what happened with the Rochefort 8, in which this occurred at the rear and almost in the throat . It is another detail for this beer. Taste nothing conflicting. Anyone can enjoy it. It receives a very balanced sweetness. Hot, more noticeable citrus persistent itching. As you approach the last drink, improvement, and much. Overall rating: Great. Provides a great time. I reconciled with the BSDA after the bad experience with the Rochefort 8. Repeat. € 2.20"
"O – Rebuy. This was my first Belgian a while back and it literally changed the way I felt about beer. I actually liked the way this tasted without having to “develop a taste” for it. Plus the fact that it’s about double the alcohol of your standard American horse kidney product is just better. There so much more complexity here than in most of our mass produced stuff and no hint of bitterness for which one supposedly needs to ""develop a taste."""

"Price Point - $8.39/750ML bottle"
"The beer is chestnut brown with an inch of beige head that coats the glass with sticky lacing. The aroma offers brown bread, yeast, light sweetness. Delicious flavor. Incredibly smooth on the palate with alcohol masterfully hidden. Subtle notes of banana and fruity sweetness lingers in the aftertaste. Overall, a terrific brew."
""
"This was a really tasty beer with lots of flavor, very easy to drink."
"Gouden Carolus Classic h a nice dark shade. The color is a shoe polish brown shade with some faint black sections here and there. A nice Belgian Esque head up top with tight dark tan bubbles that have some stick to the glass. Good retention, it lasts to the bottom of the glass. Classic has a nice nose, it is filled with deep rich malt scents, caramel, chocolate, deep dark fruit, plum, fig, raisin. This is billed as a Belgian Brown Ale, and the fruit in the nose signifies that. Some roast with warming, but no alcohol comes out. A great nose! Taste is just as superb. The dark fruit comes out even more, some plum, grape, cdied apple. A nice bready middle showing off the Belgian yeast. Not a hoppy beer, a malty fruit basket bomb beer. Feel is medium with a nice lively carb in the mouth. Refreshing beer here, A Belgian brown with class."

"This looks black, but against the light I get some leather and dark ruby on the edges. The head is nearly white and billowy, what little there is. A swirl conjures up a dense pillow of foam that is inviting. I get lots of caramel and candied sugar in the nose. Smells airy and creamy. Also a little bit of vanilla and oak, with some biscuit and oatmeal. Lots of juicy fruit up front on the palate: strawberry, cranberry. It fades quickly to thick, rich caramel, sweet candied sugar, some leather, and a bit of that coppery metallic flavor. The mouth feel is silky and slightly watery. Finish is balanced, but tending towards dry. The candied sugar in this does not linger in the throat and annoy like many other Belgians. This is a luxurious drink that is complex and rewards the patient."

"750 ml bottle. Pours brown with a long lasting off-white head and nice lacing. Aroma is of yeast, brown sugar, dark fruit, caramel, spicy hops and alcohol. Body is full and smooth. Plums, raisins, brown sugar, bready malt, spicy hops and alcohol fill the mouth. Finish is long, semi-dry. Wonderful brew."
""
""
"Pours the colour of dark milk chocolate with a disappearing lacing of white head. Smells of thick caramel syrup, brown sugar and Belgian yeast. The mouthfeel is remarkable; thick, velvety and sweet. Tastes of peppery carbonation at the front of the palate, deliciously sweet caramel in the middle and the trademark banana/clove flavour from the Belgian yeast right at the back of the palate."
"Pours a murky dark orange-brown with a foamy khaki head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, yeast, and spices. Taste is much the same with an alcohol kick on the finish. There is a mild spice bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that is drinkable but basic."

"Overall a very unique beer. It has a lot of different aspects and I seem to notice something new with every sip. My problem is it's a little too complicated almost and the taste, although unique, isn't overly pleasing to me. I appreciate it but I probably wouldn't rush to have another."
""
""
"O - I really love this beer. The sweetness is crisp and delicious while retaining a degree of drinkability. The heavy malt sweetness is a pleasure for a closing drink. Not quite sure I would have this aside from a desert occasion (similar to La Fin Du Monde) but I really enjoy it!"
""
""
""
"Overall, quite tasty. Not a world class BSDA but a very nice one."
""
"Full bodied with modest carbonation, and the alcohol is well hidden. A bottle like this could be put in a cellar for a long time, and would age beautifully. Highly recommended."
""
""
"overall: I must say, my first one didn't really do it for me. So it probably depends on my mood. The second one was very enjoyable. It's a very easy and sweet beer. You don't get much of the alcohol due the sweetness. I like the yeasty, dark fruit and brown sugar and nutty aroma combo. If i had to criticize it, it would probably be that it's maybe too sweet. Which is nice if you crave for sweetness, but therefor lacks a bit of a kick and surprise as a whole. But if you're in the mood for something like this, it's really great."

"O: Very drinkable. A little bit overwhelming alcohol in the nose but still a great beer"

"330ml bottle. Snifter glass. Enjoyed on jun´12. Pours dark Brown in color with light beige, creamy, lasting crown. Hints of nutmeg liquor, toasted malts, slightly sugary fragancy & yeast to the nose. Sweet toasted malty upfront. Gentle sugary mouthfeel, ripe & dried fruit – dates & raisins- flavors. No hops. Lingers creamy with kind warming ABV. Full body, soft carbonation. Wow!!"
""
"O- I find this to be really easy drinking in general, especially once the alcohol mellows. Lots of flavor, and balanced well between sweet and dry, this one isn't a beer that one wants to chug, per se, but this deserves to be enjoyed....it changes slightly as it warms, but keeps you feeling cozy. I recommend this brew for sure and will seek it out in the future!"
"Nice beer. Those Belgians really know how to produce dark, fruity beers like this."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A smooth and well balanced malty BSDA. A little sweet but not overly so. Easy drinking."
""
""
""
""

"Incredible balance and slightly sweet. Very drinkable. But nothing crazy or out of the ordinary."
""
"O - Beautiful flavours and incredibly drinkable for an 8.5% abv ale."
""
"O: A good beer, overall. The aroma is interesting, though a bit odd, but it is still tasty and drinkable."
""
""
"When I was tasting this beer, and the waitress told that this was the classic, I concluded: this one is maybe even beter than the Cuvee. Strange, because the Cuvee is more complex and more expensive? No, I think this one is maybe even beter, because of the lower alcohol. It is more drinkable because of that and level interesting. The mouthfeel is absolutely fabulous! 5.0 overall. This beer is the name Classic worthy."
""
"O - A real different taste compared to the original. A funny experiment and my first experience of a beer this old."
""
"Overall: Pretty solid beer and wish I waited more than 5 months to enjoy it. Oh well, it was still enjoyable and enjoyed to the last drop. Need to get me more of this soon and sit on it for a few years. I still more beers from volunteering in my stash and not sure what I am going to move on to next."
""
""
"Drinkability and Overall Impression: Initially my impression was that this was a bit strong and overwhelming. But as I sipped my way through I found that each sip followed the last naturally and easily. If pressed for two words to describe this beer I’d say they are “complex” and “complex.” ☺ But I would not use the word subtle. This one is assertive and lets you know it is there, even though some flavors take a while to emerge. My overall impression was that this beer deserves close attention and the time spent to enjoy it slowly it as it warms through a range of temperatures."

"O) A delicious Belgian brew. I would definitely have another one."
"This poured out as a dark brown color with a fluffy tan colored head on top. The retention isn't too bad here along with the lacing. The smell of the beer is lightly malty with some roasted aromas. The taste of the beer was pretty good, lots of malty flavors in there along with some burnt flavors. The mouthfeel was nice, lightly creamy feel along with some good carbonation. Overall this beer was good, I would probably try it again one day."
"O: Looks great, smells so sweet, and tastes like a great Belgian ale. Smooth, warm feel too. This is definitely better than the Troegs Mad Elf."
""
""
"O: Very solid, enjoyable dark belgian. I would definitely buy this again."
""
""
""
""
"O - This isn't an acclaimed beer for no reason! There are more drinkable examples of this style of beer, but Gouden Carolus is certainly one of the most flavourful ones."
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
"Every swirl of the glass brings the head to a creamy froth, which makes for an excellent mouthfeel. Overall, a very satisfying drinking experience. One of the best, and most drinkable, Belgian strong dark ales I've had."
""
""

""
""
"First had this beer at the Het Anker brewery and it is just as good as I remember. Worth finding."
"Notes: My 2nd Belgian Dark Strong Ale (the other being Chimay Grande Reserve) and I daresay this is a wicked, beguiling style of beer that ranks among the best beers I have had. I guess one either loves the taste profile of molasses & dark fruit or one does not. As a lifelong lover of dark fruitcake I am smitten by these flavors and seek them out as the weather turns colder and the Holiday Season approaches. I will add this beer to my pantheon and eagerly await the next bottle."
"Overall: A pleasure for the senses, but not my cup of beer..."
"Pours a dark brown color w/ excellent lacing on the snifter glass. Smell is dark fruit, malt, brown sugar and yeast. Somewhat sweet nose on this brew. Very well balanced, and none of the characters stand out. Taste profile is about the same as the nose, with some wood and sweetness really coming out. Feel is medium plus, with good carbonation and an underlying bitterness behind the malt. Overall, this is a really nice beer- but there are better in this style. Glad I got to try it on draft! Cheers."
"Served in a Kasteel glass."
"O - A very nice sipper that I really enjoyed. Not quite as complex as others I've had like Chimay Reserve but great flavors and aromas overall"
"As this warms up, the difficulty to categorize this beer is revealed. It's malty like a dubbel, but it's got the roasted flavor of a strong dark ale. No matter what, though, it's a great beer to drink. You get introduced with the malty notes, then immediately swoon by the fruity, toasty, and hoppy flavors, and then completely warmed up by the high ABV. It may smell sweet, but the sugar and alcohol is nearly absent from the flavor as a whole until it warms up. This is an extremely well balanced ale that I would champion in its beer style. Definitely worth buying more of, despite its obvious strength that doesn't make it too ""sessionable."" Whatever, that's not the point of this brew, so drink away and enjoy the crap out of it!"
"O: drinkable beer but I think I might need schedule an appointment with a dentist now."
" ~ This is a fantastic beer. I will seek out this beer again and when I find it I will by at least two. One to enjoy on a cold winter night in front of a fire and another to cellar for a few years. I bet this brew cellars very well... and I intend to find out."
"O: I really enjoyed this beer, although unlike most belgian darks, it seemed to deteriorate as it warmed, rather than improving. If you're good at consuming your brews quickly, or if you're sharing with someone else, don't hesitate to try this beer."
"I'm a big fan of this style, and this is an outstanding example. I'd rank it above Chimay Blue and it gives Rochefort 8 a run for its money (although I have only had those from the bottle). If you see it on a draft list, I highly recommend you go for it."
"This beer never fails me i've had it so many times for years. It's just nearly perfect."
"Pours a fairly-dark brown color with some crimson highlights. The nose brings forward a hefty amount of dark fruits along with some brown-sugar character. Dark fruits galore. Cherry and grape there as well. Flavor is lightly-sweet with plenty of fruit character and a creamy feel to back it all up. Chewy with moderate carbonation. Really well-done version of the style."
"The age on this is truly fascinating, but unfortunately, this much is to the detriment of the beer. Still, it's a wonderful thing to have tried, and I'm very pleased I got the opportunity."
"O: One of my top 5 beers. I can't believe I haven't reviewed it yet. I almost wish it were a little less sweet, but even so, it still works. Magnificently. Have one. Now."
"Overall: a true classic"
"The brew pours a deep mahogany hue and is capped with a frothy tan head which recedes to a wispy film. The aroma is potent; detectable from more than an arm's length away. Notes of dark dried fruit, oxidized port wine and funky Belgian yeast are observed in the nose. The flavor adds a tea-like nuance to the aroma's descriptors and shows great balance. The brew has an especially rich and creamy texture. Overall, a very nice beer, though not as nice as the Cuvee Van De Kaiser Blauw."
"This is nice. Mellow and packed with taste. We still have red grape domminant, but it seems softer in the taste. A little yeasty, accents of toffee. The alcohol is minor in character, which overall makes this beer a good one."
"Like a petite version of the Grand Cru Blue. Love it."
"All in all a very nice dark belgian ale."
"O: World class, an excellent beer I would have again in a heartbeat. Very well balanced. If Gulden Draak and Chimay Blue popped each others cherries and had a lovechild it would be this beer."
"Overall a lovely beer. I wouldn't mind drinking this again at all, and even that's a bit of an understatement..."
"jd"
"O: This was a very pleasurable beer. I really like it and for the 2.75 I paid (including tax) it's fantastic. And with every Belgian beers, this is really drinkable."
"O: A fantastic ""Belgian Brown Ale"" as it's described on the bottle. Somewhere between a Dubbel and a strong dark ale (with my benchmark being the Gulden Draak), this brew goes down smooth and warms you right up. The 8.5% ABV is evident in this beer, but only to add another dimension to the whole experience. I'm definitely feeling it toward the end of the 750ml bottle. This is a fantastic beer to chill and serve colder than typical for the style to just sit back and enjoy in an overstuffed chair with a good book and let all its wonderful nuances and flavors blossom and evolve as you slowly sip it and reflect on your day."
"The taste has Belgium written all over it. There are lots of candied sugars here, a bit of molasses, some booze soaked florals, some nice sweet roasted malts, and plenty of yeastiness. The beer is medium to full bodied and is well put together. I like the relatively high ABV and how it complements the molasses and candied sugars and brings out a nice sweet maltiness in the dark roasts. There is a touch of coarseness on the tongue, and a bit mouth prickly from the bottle fermentation. There is plenty of natural carbonation in the beer and it is best to let it settle for awhile. This is a nice dubbel, I'm not sure if I would quite put it into the Dark Strong camp just yet. I would go back for another. The complex yeastiness is a real treat. L'Chaim."
"O- I can see the quality but don't like it. Recommended if you're into the style but I myself, don't think I'll be tempted to try it again for a while."
"Classic has a nice mouthfeel. Its not at all dry because of the complete lack of hops, but its very creamy. Overall, I don't think I'll be buying this beer again, but I think that's mostly because this style of beer isn't at the top of my list. If you like sweet beers, then this may be your lucky day."
"Taste is wonderful, zesty spicy-sweet fruits, cherry, berries, plum, wood, caramelized bread crust, overall nice depth and richness. The feel is lively and engaging."
"I'd certainly try this one again. They've been making beer since the 1300's so I'm willing to accept that they've figured a thing or two out since then."
"Dr: Lovely, but expensive. Be careful of your wallets, lads - this one grows on you."
"Opinion: This is a pretty good beer, but there isn't a whole lot to make it stand out when there are a whole bunch of really incredible beers in this category. I will enjoy this whole glass, and wouldn't mind drinking it again because all of these beers are incredible...but I wouldn't put it on my ""holy grail"" of beer list."
"Very good and very drinkable strong dark ale."
"Unlike some other BSDAs or quads--Chimay Bleu, Pannepot, Three Philosophers etc.--Gouden Carolus Classic has an airiness that pairs well with ligher fare, like chicken, fava beans, and a garden salad."
"A must try if you like this type of beer!"
"pretty good, I look forward to trying the bottle of the ""Blue"" I have."
"Drink - When I first poured and smelled the beer the first thing that came to mind was Trappist Westvleteren 12. It's definetly not as good as that, but along the same lines for sure. I really enjoyed it and I will seek it out again."
"D: A wonderful Belgian ale with huge malt complexity and enough other character to give it wonderful balance. Some time will probably dry this out to some degree, but that will probably just add another degree of interesting to the exceptional ale."
"This ber is everything I hear it would be. Its heavy, oaky, and fragran. The beer pours a deep amber with practically no head, light carbonation, a fruity, oaky aroma, and a sweet taste. The beer is strong and the sugar can definitely be tasted in this beer. Served in a deep black bottle, this is a great beer."

"D - Simply another classic from Het Anker."
"Notes: Having enjoyed quite a lot their grand reserve this, while good, felt a bit generic. Unfair on my part probably, this is a quality dark ale."
"This is an impressive beer, one of my favorites in the style. Tons of traditional character, yet nothing overwhelming."
"D - This is a pretty good Belgian Dark. At times it was almost too sweet and too much."
"Drinkability: this beer is highly drinkable with a good flavor; it is not too heavy, although the alcohol is pretty well noticeable. This is good up to a point, but I feel like this could be toned down a bit."
"A nice, strong, fruity BSDA, with a well integrated and elevated ABV. Not a whole lot more to wax eloquent about here - this is just some good, good stuff, full stop. Funny how that is with these old-school tropes for a given style - ain't no equivocatin' with this one, no sir."
"Drinkability is restricted by price as with many belgians. But otherwise good"
"drinkability is ok - i am glad i tried it and it was on sale for 4 bucks a bottle but give me a chimay blue or trois pistoles over this anytime"
"Very nice mouthfeel. Slightly sweet but not syrupy. Color is a slightly cloudy brown and the lacing dissipates rather quickly. Overall I would say this is a pretty good drink despite a little heaviness. Would go well with a pizza and football. I'm enjoying it and I usually don't care for overly thick beers."
"Anyway, the beer is pretty dark with the appearance of a Belgian Dubbel. Decent amount of head. The smell is rich, caramel, ripe fruit, raisins. The taste chases the smell appropriately with a nice bite at the end, but the complexity of the flavor still lingers. It is well balanced and an excellent Belgian beer. It is fairly smooth, but does have a bit of alcohol dryness in the aftertaste."
"A tasty, complex dark ale from Het Anker."
"Overall impression: excellent for the style! smooth and tasty, this is a regular in my cellar."
"This is really tasty, but I probably wouldn't drink a lot of it. It would be amazing with a meal, or nice as a sipper, but not for extensive drinking."
"D - Can't taste the alcohol, not really a super high ABV, but still something that normally would show in most beers. Sweetness isn't so much that it's difficult to finish, definitely a sipper, but easy to go back for more. Best by date: 14/07/12"
"Easy peezy drinking. Alcohol nicely mixed in, but does burn a bit on the back end. Great beer"
"Shame about the taste. Far too dominated by a ridiculously concentrated sugary confected quality on the tongue. Quite a disappointment compared to the last time I had this."
"M/D: Medium bodied, but smooth easy drinking. Can't taste the alcohol, and glad I picked this bottle up."
"D: It's really tasty! I liked it quite a lot. I insist it's a dubbel."
"The scent is slightly burnt caramel but mostly fruits including blackcurrants, he can even think of an old wine. This is mellow, with a small side with a roasted oily palate quite spicy, fruity interesting and even acid presence, highlighted by a touch of cedar, as a result of spontaneous fermentation. But the character is obviously there and we obviously feel the power of the drink. It also operates very well in the cellar and, because of its complexity, it leaves the Charles V., his cousin, far behind."
"It is hard or me to get past the phenols in this brew, and many other belgians. I'm not generally a belgian drinker, but I'm trying. As my palate matures I may re-review."
"Nice brew ,"
"Did I miss New Gouden Carolus? Damn. Well, at least they're going back to the better-tasting recipe. It pours a clear dark ruby brown topped by a short-lived finger of off-white foam. The nose comprises figs, raisins, rye bread, red grapes, nutmeg, brown sugar, and a hint of booze. The taste leans heavily on the dark fruits, with the spices and a healthy dose of bready yeast coming in the back door. The body is starkly medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a rather smooth feel. Overall, a very solid and tasty BSDA, one to revisit regularly."
"D - The alcohol is wonderfully masked and the beer seems to have taken on that port quality that Belgian strong darks tend to. Dangerously drinkable for 8.5%"
"Notes from 02.14.10 at Akkurat in Stockholm"
"D: Good lord, this is unexpectedly delicious. Allegedly the favourite beer of Charles V, it is truly fit for an Emperor. The 8.5% doesn't show up as much as expected. I love this beer, and would love to get some more. Handing the last third off to my girlfriend was incredibly painful, but I had to share the joy. One of my all-time favourites."
"One of my personal favorites and the beer that turned me onto the style many years ago. It is a shame that brouwerij Het Anker decided to update the label recently, the previous gold and black label was a very classic look."
"Drinkability: I felt I had truly lived this beer, and not just chugged it down. Bold and flavorful, it makes for a lovely early evening sipper."
"D- Really high for an 8.5% brew, I like how they managed to balance this one out, as to not become to cloying with the sweetness."
"Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy, whisking the alcohol far above palate-level, and elevating this from a moderately good-tasting beer into a finely-crafted, drinkable ale. My experience with Gouden Carolus left me with high expectations, but the Classic really hit the right notes for this style."
"D: If you like sweetness this is your beer."
"While rochefort 10 is the plum of dark beers, this is the cherry. Very nice."
"Regal looking red body with a HUGE billowy head that stuck around persistently. I might be the only one who thinks so, but I've always thought this beer has a kind of UK/Belgian vibe as opposed to straight up Belgian. Some slight wine like vinous, dried fruit like aromas. Palate is very elegant. Dry and yeasty but with that vinous flavour coming back again. Almost port-like, absolutely gorgeous. Alcohol is well in check. Carbonation is spot-on. Truly good stuff."
"D: The alcohol is well hidden so it's very easy to consume, although this beer is better as one that is sipped."
"D: First and foremost, this is great beer. The drinkability, however, is barely average in my opinion. I feel that the alcohol should have been either lowered a bit or better incorporated. Again, this would probably rectify itself with some time in the cellar. But why cellar the Classic when you can cellar the Cuvee...?"
"Drinkability - Quite drinkable, the abv isn't noticeable."
"This is a very pleasant BSDA. Lots of flavors to contemplate as you savour it. Definitely worth a try, you'll love it if you like malty beer."
"D: a great representation of the style, though, a touch estery for my taste."
"D - A little bit thick, a little too boozy. I'll be fine with 1 of these."
"About as good as McChouffe when it comes to Belgian brown ales. A pleasure to look at and drink. Warrants multiple purchases of and relishment of, oh yeah."
"Notes: A very nice beer to sip on. A good amount of full fruity flavors including dark fruit, golden fruit, and citrus all mixing (dark most prominent). It is a bit digestif liqueur/port like in that it is pretty fruity and full flavors. Very enjoyable easy to drink beer."
"Drinkability: A pretty good beer, this supposed classic is worthy of such praise. Best enjoyed in the colder months, since it is warming and soothing."
"Drinkability is incredible. You'll finish it before you have a chance to look a the ABV. Really, very drinkable for a strong beer."
"Just a terrific BSPA, enjoyable from start to finish. I tend to like sweeter strong ales, and this one truly did it for me."
"Drinkability - 4.0 - Body is fairly heavy but the overall experience is so smooth and creamy that you hardly notice. Alcohol is well hidden. This is like a big glass of chocolate milk. You don't want one all the time, and you don't want a lot of them, but when the time is right it's very satisfying."
"D - An excellent beer by any standard, and a wonderful way to wind down the evening. Full of flavor and balance as well as substance, this one is not to be overlooked."
"Dark amber-red in color with a nice thickly laced head of small bubbles that held long after I poured it. It smells of sweet caramel, honey/toffee and malt... very sugary. The taste is fantastic! The whiff definitely doesn't lead one astray - the taste is similarly sweet and with those same notes - but I was especially surprised by how well the alcohol is hidden. I gave a taste of this to my dad (not a beer drinker) and not only did he thought it was delicious, but was blown away when I told him the ABV; ""I could have 4 of these no problem"". I concur with its drinkability which owes itself to a relatively light mouthfeel and low carbonation. Even though it's a little sweet for my taste, I think this is definitely a must-try brew."
"D - color me impressed...one of those beers i wasnt expecting a whole lot of but really surprised me. went nicely with European cheese and crackers I've been snacking on. I'd really like to know the age on this because I feel it may be in its prime now."
"D- Given some of the details from the mouthfeel, this is a very light and drinkable beer. I would never guess this would be even close to 8.5% ABV just by tasting it. Quite a good beer."
"D: Indeed, this one is somewhere in between a sipper and a session brew, simply because of it's high drinkability regardless of the ABV."
"D-- Alcohol is there but hidden well. Fruit flavors really stand out and actually think of drinking jam in a way. Very appealing gets much better as it warms up. Started drinking at about 45 degrees and got much deeper as it went over 50. 2 of these would be excellent and still would want more."
"I didn't know what to expect with this beer and I was quite happy with what I got. I can't think of any reason why you shouldn't try this beer, it's solid in all areas and underrated IMO"
"Overall, a really nice interpretation of a BSDA, made even better by its availabilty to me. The only real weakness stemmed from the appearance with the weak and fizzy head, but that's a minor complaint when taking everything else into consideration. Those Belgians really know how to disguise their alcohol and this one is of no exception. Make sure to pick one up if you see it."
"High carbonation, yet a silky smooth body, and it is beyond drinkable."
"I know I have bashed this beer a bit but I am a huuuge Gouden Carolus fan and their Cuvee Van Der Kaiser Blauw is one of my all time favourites. Perhaps unfair comparisons but this guy didn't stack up. I may also have gotten a dodgy bottle."
"The beer pours a dark amber, almost brown color with a thick frothy off-white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a nice crystal malt scent along with a subtle Belgian yeast fruitiness. It's sweet smelling with a wonderful caramel aroma. The taste is incredible. It's so smooth, yet full of depth and complexity. It has a rich, caramel sweetness that goes down without effort and finishes with a gentle yeast character. It's fruity, but not overly so. The mouthfeel is good. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is as drinkable a Belgian ale as I've ever had. Recommended."
"This beer is awesome, I would encourage all to drink this."
"Pours dark brown with a huge dense persistent head. Smell is earthy yeasty phenolic with some sweetness. Taste is caramelly with a molasses note although not high in sweetness. Plums and other dark fruits. Earthy. Finishes dry. Slight warming alcohol. Pleasant slightly bitter aftertaste. Full bodied. Pretty easy to drink for it's strength. Overall a really good Belgian."
"D - excellent, really enjoyable with complex flavours, alcohol can be noticed but aonly in later stages. One of the most enjoyable beers i've tasted"
"A fruity, spiced malty brew. All kinds of different sweet toffees involved, as well as various dried fruits - prunes and raisins - along with some caramel. A really nice, Christmas-y seeming flavor. Utterly drinkable and delicious. Would definitely pick it up again if I had the opportunity."
"All in all, this is a very nice beer. I would happily drink this again given the chance. If only the phenolics were tamed down a bit, I'd be back at the LCBO tomorrow to stock up before it's gone."
"D: This is one hell of a dangerous brew. I think that most people would really enjoy this. Overall, the warming effect is very nice. I could definitely get into this with good friends, just hanging out.."
"This is actually described in fine print on the bottle as a ""dubbel style gold award 2007"" so the Belgian Strong Dark Ale may be a misclassification here."
"Mouthfeel is thin to medium bodied with a sharp carbonation."
"This is the second brew I've had from Brouwerij Het Anker, and both have been delicious. I really hope the LCBO brings in more of this brewers products in the future."
"Pours a clear, dark ruby red with a hefty brown foam. Nose has some funk, lots of caramel and dark, rich fruit, toffee, and dark sugars. Tons of big malty flavours is this - caramel, dark fruit, apple and tea - very candy-like in some respects. Very sweet - a bit too much IMO. In the balance the bitterness seems somewhat mild. I would call this a dessert beer more than anything. Fairly light body but not too much carbonation. Fairly drinkable but not quite my thing."
"Too sweet, and too boozy for my liking."
"A good beer, a nice one to drink on its own or to start off the night."
"Pours a blackish-brown body with the faintest ruby hues and a thin off-white head. Cream coloured lacing speckles the glass. Smell is deep, dark berry fruits with a trace of sugary yeast and alcohol. Taste is blueberries, black currant, and field berries upfront, followed by vanilla and vinous grape skin in the body. Finishes sweet with very little aftertaste; some plum and prune flavours are apparent. Alcohol is undetectable. Mouthfeel is velvety and luxurious with only a hint of dryness. 'Smooth' doesn't do this beer justice. Overall, this is one of the better Belgians that I've tried. A delectable treat with subtle, fruity complexities."
"This is my first time trying this beer and I really like it. I'll definitely pick up more and cellar some just to see how it does with a bit of age on it."
"Drinkability is average. I wouldn't be able to pack many of these away and the sweetness could definitely get to you."
"Beer is smooth, wonderful. Gouden Carolus does not make a bad beer. This is a great example of a fine beverage from them. Nutty flavor, finishes cleanly. Beer is definitely on the sweet side as opposed to bitter. There is close to no bitterness in this beer at all. No aftertaste and mouthfeel is medium. Another great Belgian ale."
"....nice complexity of flavours but too sugary for my taste in ales."
"Smooth, somewhat thick mouthfeel, and still very drinkable, this is a fantastic beer, and I bet it ages like a mean bitch!"
"Drinkability - As it warms up the caramel and brown sugar sweetness becomes very noticeable. Nice burst of complex flavors but very sweet and not dry - Great!"
"Nice beer, but too sweet for more than one in a sitting."
"Pours a dark black colour with solid carbonation. Laces the glass very nicely. Taste is very sweet, with a hint of dark fruits. Its very easy to drink and the 8.5% abv is hidden quite well. Not a bad belgian ale overall. Would definately consider buying this again."
"This poured a hazy dark mahogany with some tan head. It smelled like toffee and banana and nutty malt, with some bready yeast and chocolate. It tasted like rich toffee and caramel, with nutty malt and bready yeast and some earthy chocolate. It was slightly thick with some carbonation, and had a bittersweet aftertaste. Overall this was a very nice beer with good taste and body. It hid the alcohol well and was so very easy to drink. It almost seemed half like a Belgian dark ale, and half like a Scotch ale, with tons of sweet malt. It wasn't quite as complex or delicate/refined as the dark Van De Keizer, but it was still a very enjoyable beer."
"Pours a clear dark red, almost mahogany, very thick light tan head forms, slowly settles down to a very thick layer and ring, drops a ton of lace all over the glass, looks pretty good. Smell is nice, very very fruity, fruit salad, strawberries and blackberries, mango, banana smoothie, some biscuit, caramel and brown sugar sweetness, light spice and alcohol, pretty nice. Taste is similar, a ton of banana and brown sugar up front, raisin and caramel, very fruity, strawberries and a bit of cherry, bready malt, alcohol, some spice, more banana, wheat, pretty cool character. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium to high carbonation, a bit of a syrupy mouthfeel, but pretty drinkable and the ABV is done nicely."
"A sweet, indulgent beer that is strong and complex but easy to drink. Could be truly great with a drier finish."
"As the beer warms up, I get some caramel. Nevertheless it is too sugary for my taste to have more than one per session. A good beer."
"Just awesome. Brouwerij Het Anker, I love you.."
"D: Most excellent. A perfect sipping beer on an otherwise dreary and cool evening. A great pickup."
"11.2oz. bottle served in a tulip. Poured a murky mahogany with some red highlights around the base of the glass. Head was half an inch, off-white and creamy in texture with some tiny ringlets embedded in the cap - eventually recedes into a fairly consistent skim with some sparse, yet delicate strands of lacing revealed as the brew is consumed. Nose was dark fruit - plums, figs, raisins, as well as a touch of alcohol, clove, bubblegum and either molasses or brown sugar - can't quite tease it out. Taste follows nose with perhaps a hint of chocolate malt in the mix - dark fruit still dominates on the palate. Mouthfeel is just shy of medium with a level amount of background carbonation and a dry finish. Really pleasant belgian strong dark - nice complexity and flavors are complementary without being cloying."
"Drinkability: I had this once before a year or so ago and seem to remember liking it. I hope this is a bad bottle. Its barely drinkable with the overpowering sourness and sickly sweetness. Its especially disappointing after recently having the Gouden Carolus Cuvee van de Keizer which is Belgian strong dark ale perfection."
"I liked this, and its a good Belgian sipper. The sweetness was maybe a bit too prominent for me, but I think that a bit of age would subdue that and help mesh all the flavours together further. I'll certainly be buying a few more beers to put away."
"You are taken back to the late 19th century as a captain of industry with cigars and a parlor filled with leather bound books. Sip and savor every ounce as you read or snuggle by a fire. Absolutely amazing. A certain favorite, worthy of returning to again and again."
"It feels pretty good in the mouth, carbonation is what it should be. It might be a bit dangerous because the alcohol isn't too noticeable."
"Served in a Gouden Carolus glass, pours a brown head that lasts all the time and leaves some lace. Red brown colour. Smells of dried fruits, burnt wood, soaked earth, toffee, molasses. Sweet flavor, not much pronounced. Taste of dried fruits, spices, with pepper, cloves and nutmeg. It could be a greater beer, I found that it lacks some more sharpness or having stronger ends on both smell and taste."
"OVERALL: A very tasty brew to say the least. Although it was a little average everywhere else, the two part pour was interesting and the taste profile was one of the best in the category. A must try for lovers of the style. Recommended."
"Overall this is probably the lightest BSDA I've had and the flavors are certainly a bit on the lighter side than I'm used to. That being said, this is still a very good beer and well worth a shot."
"Poured from the 330 ml bottle, I picked up one of these from a four pack because I love their tripel and dubbel so much. Appears a ruddy mahogany brown with a nice sized beige head forming thick above the rim of my tulip chalice. Fine scattered Belgian lacing lines my glass, pretty impressive look to it. Aromatics offer up brown sugar with alcohol infused raisins and a touch of faint anise in the background with some Belgian candi sugar adding to the sweetness and level of fermentation this brew has. Not boozy in the nose in anyway, but the flavor has a nice rolling profile of semi tart and sweet berry jam notes, more raisin accents compliment the malt profile. Kind of a dry yeasty nuttiness in the finish. Mouthfeel is medium bodied but not as effervescent as the bigger bottles offerings from Gouden Carolus quite airy with sticky cloying edges from all of the sweetness. Drinkability is decent a complext Belgian style brown ale, that I enjoyed but would much rather enjoy a slightly hoppier American version without the extra alcohol and sweetness."
"Overall, I really thoroughly enjoyed this. I noted I probably couldn't enjoy an entire bottle by myself but at the same time I loved my two glasses full (a bit more than 2/3 of the bottle). Probably the best ale I've discovered so far to introduce red wine drinkers into the beer world."
"This beer does well. the roasted grains are giving it the robust character of a stout."
"Poured with a nice head from the bottle and smelled of a variety of ingredients. It was a nice warm, spicy beer, sweet and malty, that's dry and very tasty; it had a mix of fruit and caramel or something sugary sweet, and a lot going on yet very good. The alcohol does not blast through, but is very subtle and makes the beer quite enjoyable. A definite recommendation for anyone who enjoys a good Belgian beer."
"Not bad,"
"D - i have had most of the other gouden carolus and enjoyed greatly, esp their christmas, however the immense variety of flavors and smells might push this passed all them and towards the top of my favorite belgians"
"Will most def be looking for this in the liquor store to see what it's like out of the bottle."
"Gouden Carolus Classic is a classic example of Belgian brewing. It justly characterizes the subtleties, complexities and mysteries of the indigenous and antiquated yeast strains. It offers a balance of sweet and bitter, an odd combination of quaffability and fullness and the ultimate paradox of something made so simply from so few ingredients that results in something so intricate with so many flavours."
"Had a bottle at Liberty St. Tavern. This is a well-made, smooth dark Belgian. It has the traditional mix of caramel and chocolate candy flavors mixing with plum and dried fruit notes. The flavor is a touch flavor, this isn't an in-your-face Belgian. Rather, it's a refined and highly drinkable ale that might take a little time for you to consider all you're tasting."
"D: Very heavy, it's like if you took melted chocolate."
"Drinkability- Alcohol becomes more evident as it warms, but is still well balanced with the sweet malt flavours. Very sweet."
"Fairly drinkable beer. I wouldn't have guessed that it weighed in at 8.5%. Solid beer overall though."
"Drinkability - My notes just say ""very"" so I must have been enjoying it enough that I put the pen down."
"Pours a dark murky brown. One inch head of a slightly off-white color. Head retention was good as was the lacing. Smells strongly of alcohol, strong malt, grass, hint of fruit, and some yeast. Fits the style of a Belgian Strong Dark Ale. The mouth feel was smooth and slightly thick. There was a high carbonation level. Tastes of strong malts upfront, with some fruit in the background. The hops appear at the finish of the beer. There's an associated tartness to the brew that leaves a dryness on the tongue. Overall, a full bodied beer with complex aromas and flavors - worth a try."
"An elaborate and elegant, highly-flavoured beer that was a joy to drink and review. There are not many beers better than this out there!"
"Overall, Gouden Carolus Classic is a solid beer that is worth a shot. Recommended."
"a very nice brew."
"taste is a bit flat, dark fruits, brown sugar, caramel, roasted nuts, a bit on the sweet side, some malt, ends with a little bitterness."
"would love to have this with some cheese and olives!"
"Pours a dark purplish brown with a foamy beige head. Wonderful aroma of chocolate, raisin, plum, grape, toffee, fig, and spice. Extremely smooth drinking because of the excellent balance of sweetness, spice and chocolate maltiness. One of my favorite beers."
"Very good mouthfeel on an easy to drink beer. Different than many belgian strong dark ales with the sourness."
"I found it very intersting & tasty, but maybe a little too complex for me."
"D: this is an ok dubbel - a bit sweet for me, hurting its drinkability score. But, it does offer some decent complexity. I would buy it again, but there are better ones out there for the money."
"Pours a dark ruby red/brown in color with a minimal off white head that vanishes almost instantly. Aroma is fairly complex, lots of dark fruits namely figs plums and raisins, sweet malt, some caramel and a whiff of alcohol. The figs are almost overwhelming and seem a bit like rum. I found the fig presence not just dominant but overwhelming, the other aromas really weren't allowed to make their presence known. The taste is similar to the aroma with all of those flavors but significantly more harmonious. There is a perceived sweetness that is present near the finish. There is also a noticeable alcohol presence that while not hot is a bit much. Mouthfeel is ok, medium+ in body with moderate carbonation, this brew seems a bit too ""heavy"". Drinkability, for me, is average. I really didn't enjoy this beer very much and I don't really care to have another. I found it to be a bit unbalanced, heavy on the alcohol, and generally not enjoyable. i will say that the intensity of the aromas and flavors seemed to die down a bit by the end of the glass making this more balanced but my taste buds may simply have been dulled by the earlier assault and decided to turn in early for the night."
"Belgian bomber, caged and corked. No freshness/brewing date/vintage info to be had. Opened with just a mild ""poof", then pours into my Belgian tulip, dark mahogany, short lived dark tan head, that leaves better then average, sticky,extensive and splotchy lacing. The pungent nose is of sweet raisins,vanilla, light rum and also some cola. Plenty of flavor and complexity packed into this one. Notes of rum soaked raisins, more cola, sweet sugary malts. Hops well in the rear. High quality, but not quite world class BSDA."
"The Afther taste is long and sweet with a touch of caramel and vanilla. An excellent beer."
"Snagged at the great Blind Pig in Champaign, Gouden Carolus pitches a deep orange-bronze with a thick finger of white froth, with moderate lacing on the way down. Lots of fruit in the nose, coupled with mild sugars. I'm impressed with the fruity complexity--orange, berry, banana--delicious, with mild amounts of hops blended. Well carbonated, this is an excellent representative of the Belgian style--bold, fruity, well carbonated. Easy beer to enjoy and consume, Gouden Carolus is outstanding, a gem well worth grabbing."
"D - It would be fairly easy to drink at least 2, but it is a bit malty"
"Overall a delicious beer, perfect accompanying a fruit and nut chocolate bar."
"D - In spades. Beautiful ale! :)"
"Great beer."
"Taste is bit more intesne but, sadly, not nearly as well balanced. BPA spice malt starts things off, peppry and with solidly burny alcohol. But the sweeter profile is subdued and a little off. The end is nice, again, nice and burny. But there's no zip, no zing, and not enough of a balance between mellow and harsh."
"Overall, very nice. Nicely drinkable despite the high ABV."
"Dark brown with a thin tan head on the top. Gentle pour didn't give much head and the glass is too small to swish around. Lacing looks good initially. Smell is light malts but really I'm barely getting any smell off this. Taste is flat and and muted belgian yesty malt. Medium sweetness, medium carbonation. Drink ability is alright, not the best Gouden Carolus I've had."
"If you can find this beer I recommend getting it. Definitely one of the best beers I have had"
"Carbonation gives a nice tingle towards the end to remind you it is a beer, and the body is medium. Long, sweet finish."
"Drinkability: Light and balanced for the alcohol level. I could definitely enjoy another. This one warmed up nicely and I found myself enjoying the aroma before each sip."
"Drinkability: I could drink a six pack of this stuff easily. It is so damn tasty. An awesome beer worth seeking out. I will buy more and cellar it."
"d: definitely worth a try and an overall good beer"
"I necked this one too quick and will slowly savour the next one. Fantastic example of the Belgian art of beer making."
"D- Nice, i loved the creaminess but felt it was too sweet for a dark belgian to drink more than 1 however thoroughly enjoyable on its own, some nice complex fruit notes make this a lovely dark ale."
"One apparent characteristic about this beer was that it was extremely sweet and sugar-laden... The sweet factor was slightly cloying and overbearing and detracted from the overall quality of the beer... Althougth not a bad sample by any means, it was overall very thick, rich and sugar-laden... Still worth a shot..."
"This isn't a terrible beer, but I can think of other Belgian strong dark ales I would get before this. Not undrinkable, but not my style."
"Mouthfeel: Mildly dry with raisin flavors. Sweet."
"This pours a beautiful dark down with a nice foamy yet not thick head. The nose is very apparent even before I finished pouring this. Quite distinct Belgian aroma. Very caramel. The taste is a tad sweet with cherry, rum and figs. Alcohol is very warming. This is a great beer."
"A solid beer that is approachable and easy to drink. It's not blowing me away, but I also can't say a bad thing about it (other than the lack of head). Right up there with the standards, but still no match for the mighty Rochefort. I prefer the Gouden Carolus Christams to this."
"Pours a hazy orange-ish/ deep amber color with an off white head. In the aroma, sweet candied sugar, and hints of alcohol. In the taste, malty, sweet caramel and small presence of alcohol. A medium body and smooth mouthfeel, with a dry sticky-sweet caramel in hte aftertaste. Alcohol is quite present and kind of sticky. However goes down easy, and good."
"It is a touch heavy, especially after drinking half of one. There is moderate carbonation, and the sweet malts mask any sign of high alcohol."
"Pours a very deep and dark amber with a slight bit of cloud on it. Big head of course. Some lacing too. On the nose it is mildly sweet. The flavor is excellent. I would describe it as mature instead of mild. Kind of hearty on the start with a smooth fruit start, and then later you get a bit of the 8% alcohol, and then on the end you get a roasted flavor. Complex, but smooth, and not over-pronounced as a whole. Definitely worth going back to. Id love to get some more of these and lay them down for a while."
"the appearance is hazey reddish brown with a head that seems to float in the middle of the glass. the nose seems to have a strong banana smell, and maybe some prune? tastes like prune, nice viscosity, and a brief smooth finish. the mouthfeel is clean and lingering, and this ale drinks very easy,overall I'm impressed a favorite of mine from belgium. give her a try."
"on tap out of a snifter, almost jet black with a tiny bit of transparency. strong belgian amber flavor common of het anker. spicy nose with a slight bit of licorice taste. very smooth mouthfeel and very drinkable, like a better, smoother version of la choullette ambree. wonderful beer, good with dark meats, or smoked salmon."
"Poured into a chalice a nice semi-dark brown color, nice carbonation, nice little creamy tannish head, some nice small islands and sticky lacing follows. The nose is malty, slightly sweet, good touch of figs, raisins, plums and caramel. The taste is malty, slightly sweet/tangy, some dark fruits, and caramel. Full body. Very drinkable, this is a very tasty."
"A gentile but classy Belgian Strong."
"Poured out of a 750ml cage & corked bottle. Color is of ruby brown, with a nice but not huge tan head, very good lacing. The smell is of sugary sweetness, dark fruit. The taste is of candy sugar, cherries, plums, a bit of spice. The mouthfeel is excellent, creamy, sits very well, a bit fizzy. This is a great complex ale, lots going on. Due to the overall sweetness and ABV the drinkablility is a bit limited. This is very nice."
"D,notes: A rich sweet comfort beer. Pretty good drinkability. Quite vinous. Very much a perfect example of the style despite the missing pepper/spice notes."
"Tastes of fruits ( apples, raisins), malt, candy sugar and a good spiciness."
"Review translated from french 5-14-2008."
"D- This beer is absolutely wonderful. It's almost... too good to want to drink a lot of. One feels the need to savor."
"M: I felt the mouthfeel was perfect on this beer for a Begian Strong. It was lightly carbonated and smooth as silk."
"This is some great Belgian beer, very tasty."
"I had a bottle at CK Diggs in Rochester MI. The appearance was murky burgandy brown, seemed to have some floaties and a nice off-white non-lacing foam. The aroma is very sweet, caramelly and toffee, a very unique beer combination. The flavor is the same, with a slightly medicinal component to it (phenol?). I actually like the flavor a lot, but the cough medicine component tempers the experience. Mouthfeel is medium to medium heavy, and the beer is as drinkable as liquid candy."
"Delicious but it can be excessive and slightly off-putting. Similarities to a rich sherry."
"Pretty drinkable BSDA, but still prefer Odyssey, Triple Imperiale, and Oerbier."
"metallic when it is served cold. Highly recommended"
"Mmmm.... tasty tasty stuff. Its been a few weeks since I've had a new strong dark belgian ale and this really hit the spot. Very tasty and drinkable"
"Drinkability: lovely beer, just right according to my palate. Well balances if slightly more spice at the back of the tongue than most dark strong ales."
"It's tasty enough to sip on for awhile. I can't say that it's one of my favorites from Belgium - spices are almost too much - But, I wouldn't mind having it again!"
"I tried this tasty beverage at Cafe Gollem with two of my travelling companions. The bartender who we met the previous evening was off duty, but was spending a couple of hours drinking with his friends. I greeted him and asked him why he was on the wrong side of the bar and he laughed and said that he was a civilian that evening and enjoying some beer just like we were planning to do. He offered us a taste of his beer, Goudon Corolus Classic, which was a friendly thing to do, and we were astonished at the great plum-like fragrance and splendid taste. We each had two bottles each and decided that it was the finest beer we had ever tried in our lives! They had the Westy 12 available too that night, but we stayed with the Goudon Corolus Classic because it was so delicious!"
"Highly recommended to afficiandos of classic Belgian strong dark ales."
"I think this beer just barely avoided being too sweet for me - or at least being too sweet relative to the strength of the flavors. As it is, I could easily have another. Not a favorite, but a more than decent beverage."
"There's good structure to this beer: all the elements seem to hang well together."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, zippy up front, smoothing out into a slick, lightly carbonated treat."
"D - Alright. Worth a try. I think the yeast carries this beer, but other Het Anker Gouden Carolus beers are superior (the tripel comes to mind)."
"Another Belgian I am glad I tried. Color is cloudy dark amber with a thick, rich head. The smell is weak but nice and beery. Flavor is zingy, with fruity undertones and a good hoppy kick. This is the kind of ale you don't gulp down, but sip and savor when in good company."
"I had three and, after just the first one, I thought that the drinkability was rather good. I paired this with a shark dinner and it seemed to compliment the meal really well. Not my favorite offering from the Het Anker brewers, but I would most certainly have this one again."
"I could probably drink a lot of this, and that might quickly become a problem based on its high ABV."
"Purchased this 330 ml bottle at whole foods, but originally had on tap at the hop leaf. Chilled and poured into watou goblet. Nice one finger creamy off white head with good retention and lacing. The body is warmer slightly muddy brown with a reddish tones, looks Like a beautiful murky riverbed. Smell is robust, complex and pleasantly abundant. The aromatic malt is wonderful along with the esters, deeply reduced sherried fruit, tiny hints of spice, maybe cinnamon, notes of non-obtrusive raison, there are poached apples, the smallest hints of pear and banana and maybe even a small bit of strawberry. I have to say anker does esters so well. The taste is no less great, a wonderful sweetness that is balanced by a slight bitterness, which makes me feel like a am drinking just the perfect moist yet dry fruit. Not cloying in the simply a very well rounded complex and invigorating, tasteful beer. The abv is perfect not, so strong it over powers or is even really apparent other than a subtle slow warmth. Honestly I am so impressed with this brewery. This beer is so drink able its ridiculous, there is no question Ill buy again."
"Pours a deep ruby brown with lots of head that just refuses to go away. Smells spicy, almost cinammony and possibly some nutmeg? The taste is very nice, sweet and malty. Some chocolate flavor and lots of fruitiness. Tiny bit of raisin. Mouthfeel is awesome, it's got that sort of ethereal feeling to it that you only seem to get from strong belgian ales. Anyway, it's thick and heavy and creamy, and good. All in all, it's probably the best beer I've had, I'll definitely be looking for this again."
"Smell was absolutely amazing. Keeping in mind that a 5.0 means that it is not possible to improve upon this, I still deemed to give this a 5.0. Chewy caramel is present here, as is toffee. A little bit of brown sugar, along with toasted oats. Smells are potent enough to detect without any trouble, but not over powering. Smells absolutely delicious! Taste, too, is loaded with these profiles. Especially the caramel and toffee. At 8%abv, there is nearly no alcohol detectable at all. This is nearly void of any bitterness what-so-ever. Sweet, smooth, and easy drinking all the way through, with a very slightly alcohol influenced warmth on the finish that is very, very pleasant. I could easily knock out 3 11,2oz bottles of this in a sitting. Amazingly and scarily drinkable! A smashing example of the style!"
"D: Underwhelming drinkability. I was put off by the nose on this one. Too sweet and medicinal for my liking. I've had this on draft and came away a much favorable impression."
"Overall: This is a good Belgian Strong Dark Ale. Not a complex or not the best mouthfeel. Worth picking up if you see it at the store."
"Lightly hazed toffee colour with a thin, light brown head that produced spotty lace. Looks nice! Pleasant aroma of dried fruits, raisin, toffee, and honey. Mild bitterness, lots of toffee and ripe/dried fruit, with a little alcohol warmth in the finish. Just a little too sweet though. Medium/full bodied with lowish carbonation, making for a rich texture. I enjoyed this one quite a bit. Thanks for sharing biegaman!"
"drinkability is good. the 8% alcohol is hidden very well. a bit of a sipper due to the sweetness, but the depth and complexity in the flavour makes it a very tasty and enjoyable beer. another standout of the evening. thanks jan!"
"*edit*: Knocked the mouthfeel down a point. This goes flat very quickly."
"Drinkability - very good ale, especially with food. High abv makes it not very sessionable."
"The drinkability is high as the alcoholic content is well hid in the balanced and complex flavors that comprise this quality brew. This is a great beer and one of the must try Trappist ales."
"¡Salud!"
"D: It's pretty sweet. I'd probably split the 22 ounces with someone the next time I have this, but it is pretty good, it's rich, and it's pretty complex. Definitely serve this at cellar temperature."
"Drinkability: A tasty , sweet brew. Definatly worth a try."
"Purchased: Plaza Liquors, Tucson AZ"
"Overall - An excellent beer... Would probably be up there with the likes of Rochefort 8 and 10 with a little bit more age... Highly recommended..."
"Opaque reddish-brown in the glass with orange highlights and a fluffy tan head that leaves rings with each sip as it vanishes. Smells of dark fruits and butter cookies. The taste has an incredible complexity to it, which somehow blends many disparate flavors together in a manner in which you can't discern where one ends and the other begins. The richness of toffee and butterscotch merge with a biscuit yeastiness, the sweet fruit flavors of plums, dried apricots and raisins, a peppery spiciness and a rum-like warmth. Very smooth and creamy mouthfeel. Quite delicious and easy to drink given it's strength and complexity."
"Creamy mouthfeel, very slight tartness, and an even slighter bitterness. Has a sweet finish, and only at the very end, a subtle alcohol warmth."
"Pours a deep brown, ruby color with very little head. Smell is raisiny and chocolate sweet- too sweet for me. Taste is also too sweet- reminds me a lot of raison de etre. Mouthfeel is flat. Just flat. Eh. I'm a fan of the dark Belgians but something about this one just didn't fly with me. I feel like I have a cavity now."
"This beer pours a hazy reddish-brown color. Its head is tall and an off-white color, producing ample and intricate lace. The aroma is good: spicy and peppery, with a lot of raisin and malt. Theres notable alcohol smells that rise out of the glass as well. The taste is malty and sweet, with a very serious warming sensation. The brew is very effervescent, almost fizzy. The combination of the alcohol and carbonation give the beer a hot sensation. Theres lots of peppery, spicy flavors in the taste, becoming more prominent into the finish. Also, the malt is notable throughout the experience, along with a toffee-like caramel sensation thats more evident in the foretaste. Full bodied and very satisfying. This is a very good beer."
"Pours a dark, ruddy brown color with a ruby hue and a gorgeous 2-fingered frothy head leaving behind mass amounts of lacing. The aroma is of bananas, dark fruits like plums, dates, some brown sugar, maple syrup, yeast, caramel, tropical fruitiness, cherries, just extremely complex. So many subtleties all mixed in together. Then the taste gets even more complex. Tastes of banana esters of yeast, plums, raisins, toffee, clove, vanilla, candies, extremely ripe dark fruits...it has it all. Just amazing. With an alcohol% of 8.5, you would NEVER guess. The ABV is extremely well disguised. Mouthfeel is airy and slippery on the tongue. Medium-Heavy bodied with moderate carbonation, not too much. This is one of THE best Belgian Strong Dark Ales I have ever had. Every sip brings about new delicious flavors and nuances. I am amazed at how well crafted this brew is. A+"
"Poured a deeep reddish-brown color with massive slightly off-white puffy head. Smell is rich and dark fruity with strong notes of plums and dates. Taste is an enjoyable mixture of plums, figs, molasses, and cherries. Finished with a light sweetness. Very b=drinkable for the alcohol content. An exceptional beer."
"Drinkability: I forgot I had this bottle in the cellar, found it, and decided to crack it open. I love the GC tripel and this is no different. One of the better BSDAs I've had the pleasure to try. I'll be buying more and cellaring them if I can indeed find them."
"That's a really complex beer. The appearance is great, reddish-dark color, great head, etc. The smell is complex, flowery, fruity, reminding some fruits like plums, raisins, etc. The taste follows the smell, and it's balanced, really nice. It runs nicely over the palate, opening more flavors... i could drink some really easily..."
"Overall Impression: Only flaw I can note is the lack of a head, but given the firm abv, thats understandable. A very nice beer, a great sipper."
"Opened a 12oz bottle. Poured a light brown with slight copper color, some haze. Head was moderate with a tan color. Aroma was primarily malt/yeast, with some caramel and fruit. Flavor expanded on the aroma, bringing in apple and bubblegum tastes. The mouthfeel was creamy, with a nice warmth from the alcohol. Overall, an enjoyable brew."
"BIG taste- in your face taste. Maltiness with sticky sweet toffee flavor, it hovers on your tongue before journeying onward. A little spicy like pepper and cinnamon. And a bite! The aftertaste/lingering effects of this one are fantastic...sweet sugars linger and there warming 8% of this one are definitely felt. Nice."
"The whole reason I decided to get a bottle of this beer was sheerly for the really cool looking label. Little did I know that what lay inside was so special. Poured a dark brown, ruby color with a small white head which clung to the sides of the glass from start to finish. Aroma was very impressive, with a bouquet of raisins, plum, honey, molasses and even more dark fruit as it began to warm up. Taste was equally as satisfying with flavors of molasses, more dark fruit, spicy clove, even some mild cookie like tastes going on as well. Mouthfeel was thick and syrupy, but not too much of either, seemed just right as far as being balanced. It is a strong beer that gives the body a nice warming sensation, but serves to mask the alcohol quite effectively. This is a really super beer worth drinking. It fulfills everything I look for in a quality Belgian Strong Dark. Cheers"
"This beer was delicious. I had this sandwiched between a Rochefort - Ommegang vertical tasting. Pours dark, with a very smooth, almost creamy appearance. Nice head. A strong aroma is present, very fruity, with typical Belgian plum and banana scents along with some caramel. Mouthfeel is full, velvety, dessert-like, and not overly carbonated. The taste is full of complex flavors; tart fruit and sweet candy sugar, roasted maltiness, vanilla, all balanced well. The two-year old bottle that we followed with retained all of the intricate characteristics of the unaged beer, but attained an even greater balance and smoothness."
"Poured from the 330ml bottle into my Duvel tulip glass. Body is a cloudy deep brown with tan highlights, topped by an inch or so of creamy, khaki-colored head that settles rather quickly. Sweet aroma of dark fruit (plums, golden raisins), toffee, and a touch of maple, along with some yeasty funk. Palate is again mostly dark fruit, with notes of raisins, dates, and maybe dried apricots. A deep, almost burnt caramel flavor comes from the malt, with along with an earthy edginess from the yeast. Finish is relatively light for such a strong beer, but there is also a nice warming sensation from the alcohol. Body is well-carbonated, yielding a nice creamy texture. A slow-drinking, warming sipper is good on a cool spring evening."
"D - Very nice indeed. Walks up to the line of being overly sweet without crossing it. Recommended."
"After my initial enthousiasm, I feel this beer is a little out of balance, I feel the beer has a lot of sugar in it, which make it a little empty. On the other hand it is pretty sticky and hops are almost absent. Nevertheless, complexity and spiciness make this a very good beer."
"Not that the Gouden Carolus is a new beer or anything, but everytime I drink this beer, whether in bottle or on tap, I'm convinced that I've discovered something new and rare. It never ceases to amaze me. Crisp and refreshing - almost citrusy at times, but malty and smooth, with such a pleasant aftertaste. Aroma is sweet and spicy and delicious. My wife, who has developed quite a taste for Belgian ales over the last few years, declares this her favorite of all, and at times I find it hard to disagree with her. But then again, there are so many fine Belgians out there. Praise for the Gouden Carolus."
"Ummmm...A fabulous beer at all ends and on all levels. Serious in its, depth, power, and finess. Pours a rusty brown / maroon hue with a muddled haze and stubborn, rocky head retention. Smells strongly of fruity malts, tartness, and alcohol. Very sweet on the dried and ripe fruit flavors: plumbs, figs, dates, apples, pears, berries, and licorice. Big spiciness helps the alcohols and sweetness to fuse seamlessly. Full and rich on the palate without becoming thick or chewy. Remaining sweet, spicy, and tart through to the aftertaste. Finishes a balances sticky sweet with fusal alcohols that persist more in the aftertaste than at any other moment. Still, a fabulous beer and a joy to savour."
"Overall it's a very drinkable beer. There is no heat or other sign it's an 8% ABV brew. Very pleased with this one."
"Pours into the brewerys glass a dirty, nontransparent red oak color. Froth is thin and short lived. Aroma is peppery with a surprising amount of sour lemon peel, cloves, and banana. Taste is fermented dark fruit such as cherries, plums, and also some melon. Pepper is evident as well. Mouth feel is medium bodied, light and tingly on the lips and tongue although it becomes chewy as it warms. Drinkability suffers slightly from fruitiness. There is simply so much big fruit. Its overwhelming. ABV is covered fairly well but some shows through. Very good but not outstanding."
"Gouden Carolus Classic (D'or according to my bottle) is one of the best BSDAs that I've had the pleasure to drink. I wish I knew the bottling date so that I could determine whether aging had nothing or everything to do with the beautiful beer that is now in a far, far better place than the little brown bottle that formerly contained it. This one is worth every penny."
"BB 08-07-06 and quiet some time in my cellar. Poors in with fine and lasting beige head and a dark brown but clear beer and rubin red shine when holding into the light. Nose is very malty, burnt coffee and caramals dominate but there is a nice yeastfruit in the back. Overall very fresh and malty. Taste is full, sweet, burnt with light bitterness in the aftertaste. Enjoyable but bit sticky not realy disturbing though and well drinkable beer."
"very nice brew. not overly serious or complex like some of thier other styles but delicious and highly drinkable. Kick ass beer."
"This is pretty good but the Grand Cru version was far more impressive."
"Poured into a Duvel glass, dark brown turning toffee orange around the edges, a creamy froth of a head with beautiful lacings down the glass. Nice, but not spectacular. Sweet, sugary molasses and/or raisens with slight phenolic aroma underlying. Very sweet, rich, and malty presense, and has this earthy herbal underlayer that balances this beer out very well. I get caramel, a hint of chocolate and a kind of sweet clove. Body is decent, rich and smooth, but nothing too special. Really this is just a great beer, another Belgian that I love."
"Great feel in the mouth and way too easy to drink."
"The mouthfeel is very full bodied, high alcohol warms you all the way through. A beer to be savored and enjoyed for a long time. Thumbs up. Neck and neck with St. Bernadus 12"
"Note my bottle claimed 8.5% Vol on the neck ring."
"I believe this is the beer I'm drinking--the style and ABV match--but the 11.2 oz bottle reads Gouden Carolus Caralus D'Or instead of Classic. Pours a dark burgundy brown with a finger of dense beige head and some really good retention. Aroma is very strong plum, slightly vinous, brown sugar, mint, and just a hint of alcohol. Taste is nice and fruity, plum, currant, slight melon--all with a nice candi-sugar background, not too sweet, some peppery spices kicking in towards the end. Mouthfeel is medium and creamy, maybe slightly undercarbonated. Alcohol stays hidden throughout. This is a great tasting sipping beer,"
"In general a deepy brown color, strong beer for the most mexican beers, i try this in a 12 oz bottle, my wife gift me this beer and the christmas carolus in december 2004, and this beer it disappointed to me; its color may be is for its malt, i can compared wit st sebastiaan dark in its flavor, try with mexican food, and german cuisine, drink direct from the bottle or in a goblet; 70% recommended."
"This is one of the best brews Ive had in this style and I will drink this as long as its available. Beautiful!"
"Dark purple color with an off-white colored head that has good retention and leaves behind some lacing. Aromas of figs, plums, and dates are detectable. The taste mirrors the aromas with an additional malt finish that contains just a touch of bitterness. This bitterness grows in the back on my throat and is not unpleasant. Good drinkability."
"I would if I could, drink a bunch of this stuff, but the 8% does hit a bit later with a bit of warmth. Oh so nice a drinker though. Gone in no time. A solid Belgian brew. Me likey."
"A thick maroon color, the Gouden Carolus Classic has a head made up of fine beige bubbles that provide excellent lacing. Smells sweetly of fruit and alcohol, plus some spiciness from the alcohol and some anise. Taste has a sweet/sour fruitiness going on with strong alcohol notes. Mouthfeel is thinner than I expected. Good sipper, quite drinkable."
"Pours a cloudy dark brown under a one finger beige head that settles at a respectable pace to film and collar, then lasts forever. There are a few spots of lace, but could be much more. The nose is strong and tart, with plum sweetness and cinnamon spiciness. The mouth is well carbonated and quite heavy, sticking like syrup to all areas of the mouth. Nice blend of flavors here, with plum and raspberry sweet, lemon tart and some sort of spice that leads to a beat of bitterness, but never quite gets there. The fruit and spice remain past the finish and into the aftertaste, leaving a refreshed palate looking for me. A complex beer, for sure, and very enjoyable."
"D: not as complex/tasty/robust as other more grandeur strong dark ales, this is still a gem which the Mechelen-ese are so rightly proud of (I met several during my trip and all didn't hesitate to brag about this classic brew). But interestingly, even I had several bottles of this at various cafes in central Mechelen and Leuven, only when tasting it at the Het Anker Cafe and, surprisingly, at home, could I truly appreciate the slightly understated flavour and complexities which shied away in a more noisy place with semi-cold serving temp. I suppose, at least for me, it should be sipped quietly and at a slightly higher temp. like 12 or 13 degree Celsius, when this beer is at its most delicious~~"
"Reviewed on incorrect beer on 10-24-2004. The bottle said D'Or but was not Cuvée Van De Keizer as was previously entered."
"Malty upfront with raisins, and sugars, some of the above mentioned yeast aromas are now tasted, some herbal hops towards the end. The alcohol does register as warming pepper, but it works well with the sweet flavors. Very tasty. I could get very wasted, very fast if sessioning this one."
"I like this one. It isn't the prettiest, and it doesn't put out the best aroma, but as far as drinking it goes, this is first class."
"Bottle: Poured a dark color beer with a thick foamy brown head with excellent retention. Aroma of figs with sweet alcohol notes and typical Belgian yeast is easily identifiable and greatly enjoyable. Taste is quite rich with figs and plum sweetness with a thick body and warm alcohol note mix with lots of yeast. Very enjoyable though not my favourite from this fine brewery."
"Another exceptional beer from Het Anker. Poured into a Chimay chalice, beer pours a murky caramel brown with a nice lasting head. Aroma is slightly sweet, fruity. Taste is rich, creamy, citrus fruits mixed with some dark fruits, caramel maltiness and toffee. Alcohol is almost unnoticeable. Full, malty mouthfeel. Very drinkable, you could have a few of these no problem (at least on the tastebuds)."
"Drinkability: A very nice Belgian Strong Dark; not as rich and deep as some, but definitely worth a look"
"D = Not a session beer. The 8.5 finishes that off. Not cheap either."
"I preffer the tripel or the ambrio Gouden Carolus over this one, but a good beer after all. Maybe this one is a bit more standard, not intended to surprise."
"Small 330 ml bottle...hazy dark brown appearance with little in the way of noticeable highlights. Nice frothy tan head, lots of thick laces stick on the glass in sheets. Muted aromas, a sense of woodiness and musky leaves, perhaps lacking in a big statement. Medium body, nice active carbonation. Well-composed flavors, definitive yeasts, some almost strident notes of currant and berries subsiding in a nice transition to an overall pleasing maltiness. Still, lingers as light and not ponderous from beginning to end. Some senses of earthy tannins with a contrasting sense of accented brightness. A very pleasant and quaffable beer."
"better than a wine, better than a port. Beautiful wine dark. Like a great barleywine, and can be aged for years more.Gorgeous aroma, cherries. Sweet raisin, plum, light brown sugar dry mix. Complementary spices of clove and cinammon with cherry. Can drink anytime for satisfaction. Medium mouthfeel, not overpowering."
"I'll buy this ale anytime, but reserve it for my mild Mexican winters."
"Very curious indeed, I'm not sure what I really think about this stuff at the end, except that it's an ale that gives you a lot to contemplate and explore and decipher. Definitely not a session beer, but more for those who like solving mysteries and pouring over clues that tend to shift and morph over time--like a Scooby-Doo mystery that DOESN'T end with the surly old neighbour dressed up as a monster or alien, who would have gotten away with it if it wasn't for those meddling kids. I am left with the traces of thick crumbly brown sugar-coated date bread in my mouth as I finish this glass and this review, if nothing else this is a very filling ale."
"The classic comes in the same bottle as the Triple, the only difference is the colour of the label: black for the classic and golden for the triple. 330 ml bottle, best before of April 2008. A dark mollasses brown in the chalice glass, tinges of ruby and rosewood. A greatly appealing colour, topped by an ample bone-white head, fine and creamy, leaving sticky sheets of lace. I think my glass deadened the head a little somehow--the first time I poured this beer, into the exact same glass, I got a much larger and much more consistent foam. The colour of the beer is so rich and substantial-looking that it gives off a great variety of hues, some purple and some more ebony. I get a bitter woodiness in the aroma immediately; also wormwood. Oak, wood chips, raisins and brown sugar. I was expecting it to be different: there exist all the classic dark aromas of this style(like Trois Pistoles, etc) but this hard-to-describe aroma really sets it apart and makes it a little unique. The sweetness is nicely balanced, giving blackberries, dark candy and licorice. Sniffing above the glass gives the earthy-wood aromas, along with the spicy phenols. In closer I smell cloves and cinnamon; red grapes and red wine, merlot, tannic. The fruitiness is behind all these in the form of red apples, dried prunes, as well as some pear and nectarine. A subtle aroma, but one with great layers of complexity. I cannot get enough of it. The taste delivers on the aroma's promise. Again, like the Triple, this is very velvety and pillowy on the tongue. Tree bark and oak mix with the roasted sweet maltiness at first. In the middle is a little chocolately dustiness, similar to dark roasted coffee. The finish is fruit-filled and very coffee-like, or even similar to hot chocolate. Alcohol is only noticeable in the aftertaste. The finish is syrupy and quite sweet, but it still allows for some sourish grassy astringency to come through(possibly from the hops.) Lowly carbonated and easy to drink, though quite sweet. This really is fantastic, and anyone who tries this and Gouden Carolus Triple can consider themselves privileged. Paired nicely with havarti, though the beer's alcohol overpowered it a little. Het Anker Brewery is definitely one of my favourite discoveries of the year."
"For me, this beer is too sweet to drink regularly."
"The malt hits you right away and stays througout. Complex. I pick up some alcohol notes towards the end. This fades and gives way to more sugary flavors. Overall a wonderful beer but not easily drinkable for me as it is very sweet."
"The flavor offers a briliant, sugary mix of raisins and light toffee with a hint of orange-chocolate in the background. The yeast also tosses in some bubblegum-like phenolics (sugar and clove-like spice) that turns it a touch candyish. Some herbal hops appear at the swallow and lend it an earthy, mineralish edge that helps to round out its candyish character. The bitterness is a touch limited as might be expected, but it punches through the malt midway, and there's enough there to keep it from becoming cloying in the long-lingering finish. The alcohol, although it's only 8%, does appear once it warms, but it never becomes excessive and actually adds a touch of spiciness that's welcome against the candyish malt. Quite nice."
"Bottle. YEAH BABY!! Deep cloudy dark brown (poured in all the yeast) with good head and plenty of lace. Smells DIVINE, sweet dark smooth brown sugar, rum and raisins. Tastes even better, smooth, sweet then dry and crisp. Almost perfect palate with a slightly warm and dry alcoholic finish. God this stuff is good; Trios Pistols sans the slightly off bits. YUM!"
"Poured into a large tulip shaped glass with an almost opaque dark brown color and a huge 4+ inch tan head. Lots of lace. Right away the smell jumps out at you with brown sugar, dried dates, figs and malty undertones. The mouthfeel is a dry, medium bodied and fully coating goodness. Lots of dried fruits come to mind in the flavor, again dried dates and figs. The alcohol is not that obvious at first, it doesn't hang over the ale. Nor does it compete with the rest of the flavor profile, but it's in there! After a medium finish, the alcohol makes itself known with a warming feeling in the belly. All-around there is alot to appreciate in this ale, but the exceptional balance is what makes it shine for me."
"Toatally awesome."
"tastes smooth, with alot of butterscotch and buttered popcorn.. butter! smooth! malt! yeast! almost no detectable alcohol. a beautiful beer and the 2nd best carolus.. try the noel! this one would be a perfect session beer if you were rocking the hotel erasmus in brugge.."
"Pours a really dark auburn brown color. Good amount of yeast floaties in there and a solid tan head. Really dark for a Belgian. Smell is intensely alchoholic mixed with a strong raisiny flavor. Its nice, but I don't know if that will translate to a good flavor. The body is a bit weak which doesn't help. There's lots of dark fruits with plums, raisins, and figs. I don't really notice much else other than fruits and alcohol. Well, as it warms I get more of a nutty/yeasty flavor for the base which helps this beer get a little bigger in body. But the super dark fruits and alcohol sting are wearing on me after a bit. Finish is acidic and mildly dry. Really sharp flavors around the edges, I bet this mixes well with sharp cheddar cheese, unfortunately I'm eating it with hambuger helper. I think a small bottle would be enough, but I'm going to finish the 750 anyways. Good beer in small amounts or with sharp cheeses (guess) but nothing I'd have too often."
"Had this twice over the course of 9 days at Redbones. Initialy a nice standard Belgian dark, similar to some of the Binks. It was the second taste that really merits a review. By the ninth day it had mutated into liquid candied sweet potatoes - the kind with generous amounts of brown sugar and molasses. I swear some of RB's sweet potato pie and sweet bbq sauce had changed the keg by osmosis. Probably not what was supposed to happen but truely groovy decay."
"Draught: This one poured a dark reddish-brown with a thick creamy off-white head. I was suprised that the aroma was a bit weak for the style. There were some noted of fruits (plums et. al.) and caramel. The tatse was much better than the aroma. It had a caramel sweetness, with fruits in the background. The after-taste was a bit sour/tart. A very nice beer."
"Other comments: I was briefly reminded of Rocheforte 8 when I took my first few sips. It's a bit cleaner than that beer, though. I was surprised to see that it is not bottle conditioned (at least that is the case for the 33cl version). Quite a delightful beer!"
"This a rather nice, drinkable Belgian. The 8.5% abv is difficult to detect, so I'd be careful with repeated pints. The biggest problem I have with this is the price. A similar quantity of Chimay Blue is over a dollar cheaper at The Viking, and Gouden Carolus, while good, isn't worth the added expense."
"This is very satisfying on the palate with the right balance of carbonation to make it peppy and the sweetness to provide the body. This would be more drinkable if it was just a little less sweet."
" Very special ale, hunt it down, if you must!"
"Poured a deep orange color with a milky caramel\orange smell. Creamy white, thin but durable head with good lacing. Tastes like a spicy orange caramel candy with a tiny bit of sour malt flavor in the sweet finish. Goes down smooth, probably helped by the lower carbonation on tap (will have to try this in a bottle as well.) I never would have guessed this was an 8 ABV, the alcohol is quite muted in this beer. All in all, quite impressive."
"Very dynamic flavor. Licorice characteristics up front, red and black, but mainly black. Caramel and toffee come about next and shortly there after, it moves to the fruit with plums and candied coated raisins. The finish is moderately yeasty, somewhat dull and displays flavors of banana and cookie crumb with a well known alcohol kick. I really like this stuff. It tastes very good. I have been very impressed with Anker's offerings so far and am planning on visiting the brewery while in Belgium this summer."
"The mouthfeel is smooth. This is a medium bodied beer with a good carbonation level. There is a citrus finish that lingers on the tongue after swallowing. I think this is better much better on tap than in the bottle I sampled before."
"Pours a medium brown with a blooming head that leaves some great lacing,aroma is orangy and softly spiced.Taste as well has nice orange flavor with some real nice spicey notes.A light sour note in the finish that actually went well with the malty sweetness of this beer.a classic and joy to drink."
"I had to try it since it was the last one on the shelf. Nice beer, but I prefer my Belgian strong dark ales to have a little more thickness and/or bitterness."
"a dead set ripper in anyones language. this is a brew that is impossible not to like. there is no way anyone can dispute its class. and you gotta love a beer thats good at any stage, but gets better with age. yummo!!!"
"Coppery brown color with light tan head. Slightly hazy. Aromas of sweet dark malts, coriander, significantly low alpha hops, cocoa and maybe some french roast coffee. Tastes rather malty and sweet, again with some coriander coming through. Sweetness goes through to the finish. Rather thick, yet effervescent, making it very drinkable."
"Drinkability  If you enjoy the style this one is a must try."
"Drinkablility: I dunno...it just didn't strike me as a great beer. I was expecting more. I think i would definitley have to give this one another try."
"A deep reddish brown ale witha beige head that dissapeared quickly.Strong sweet malty aroma with hints of prunes and figs.The malt is really impressive in this ale. Has a nice lively mouthfeel with a nice crispness. First flavor that stands out is cherries and malt. Doesn't seem as though the yeast is playing as big a part in this belgian compared to others I've had. This is a very flavorful easy to drink Belgian in my opinion."
"Tasted on draft at Het Anker in Mechelen. Appearance: Rich, reddish brown. Thick head, crystal clear. Aroma: Malty, some roastines. Flavor: Sweet, slight spiciness, rich caramel flavors. Very clean. Finish: Clean, malty flavors, slight spiciness in finish."
"Had this one in ""the cellar"" for almost a year. Deliciously muddy amber brown with a tan head. Smells of tart grapes, whiskey and alcohol. Taste is complex. Tart grapes, sweet malts, nutty oaky flavors, and the whiskey again. Warming. Great. Lively champagne-like feel, but quite a mouthful."
"This one sadly kicked out while my pint was pouring, but the bartender was kind enough to give me this sample, and I was glad that he did. A very enjoyable beer, quite complex, and one that I would certainly have again if and when I can find it."
"Enjoyed at Burgh's in Bridgeville, PA. Served with a dense cream colored head atop a brownish red body. The aroma was sweet malt and a bit of a bready-yeasty note. The taste was very good, with solid sweet malt being well balanced with some hops and dark fruit flavors. I don't know what I was expecting from this, perhaps a Gulden Draak type taste, but it is much more balanced than that. The sweetness and alcohol are not as powerful. There's also a bit of a vanilla-nut taste. Mouthfeel is creamy with fine carbonation adding a silkiness to it. Drinkability is surprisingly good. I didn't notice the alcohol at all. I'll definitely keep my eyes open for this in bottles. A great beer to cap off the evening."
"When I purchased this beer, I thought it was their tripel. When I poured it, imagine my response when I saw the color! My disappointment was quickly disappated by the taste. Nice, dark malty taste. Extremely smooth and enjoyable. I cannot find a single negative about this beer. Creamy, fruity, and dark. Deep brown, initially a large head, some retention. Not quite a Rochefort 10 or Westy 12, but as good as any other dark Belgian ale, IMO."
"This beer pours a hazy medium dark brown/red with a moderate brownish quickly disapating effervescent head and a firm mouthfeel. The smell was sweet with a hint of butterscotch and slightly cedary. The taste is sweet malt with peppery alcohol and a cedary tasting hoppy finish. A sweet very smooth belgian with a nice hoppy finish. Very tasty."
"Very nice. Very sweet, but with just enough hops to keep it from being uncomplicated."
"This is a dark, almost impenetrable brown Belgian Ale. Fruit-like aroma hits you instantly. I bought two 1PT9.4FL.OZ bottles and was awarded a free glass, so assume this is appropriate nose I should expect. A heavy malt body is intermingled with assertive hops, but as you drink on the sweet candy sugar and malt and somewhat strong alcohol prevail. The nice beige head dissipates too quickly. So if you enjoy a big lasting head (we're still discussing beer here), pour this straight down to the bottom of the glass and drink it fast."
"Not bad but expected more due to hearsay. Maybe it was a bottle that's been tossed around too much? Maybe it needed age more?"
"Hazy dark orange, light brown. Frothy bleached white head that dissapaited quickly. Weak on the nose and nothing really discernable. Rolls across the tongue, thick. A bit tangy and a bit peppery. The ABV seems to be a moving target, my bottle said 9%. For a heavier beer it was very drinkable."

"Notes & Drinkability: A pretty damn delicious brew."
"Gouden Carolus: A beautiful beer, deep copper/red, somewhat murky, with a rich, thick tan head. The head hangs on for quite a while, then slowly dissipates to form a lasting lace around the glass. Full, complex aroma, sherry-like, with hints of apple, some dark fruits. The taste is also like a sherry, with some vanilla flavors, a faint oakiness, apples; very smooth! Warm, slightly spicy finish, and a lasting warmth from the alcohol (8% abv). An outstanding beer."
"Pretty good little brew, lots of malt flavour in here and hints of caramel and toffee, but quite yeasty aswell, which was the only downer."
