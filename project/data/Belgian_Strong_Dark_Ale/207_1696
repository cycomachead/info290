Really good retention gives way to a lush slightly creamy thick veil of lacing...  The color is a murky light-to-medium brown...  Loads of quickly paced micro bubbled carbonation streaks rise throughout...  In addition, a bunch of medium to large side carbonation bubbles cling to the sides of the glass...  Effervescent...    The nose is highlighted by loads upon loads of sweet dark fruits...  Cherries...  Figs...  Plums...  Raisins...  Some brown sugar...  Light Belgian yeast notes...  Faint notes of vanilla as well...  A very subtle booziness...  World class aroma...  The palate is a slightly more muddled version of the aroma...  The brown sugar is a bit more pronounced and the dark fruits recede a tiny bit...  There's also the addition of smoke and tobacco on the finish...  Medium bodied... Sturdy...  Loads of prickly carbonation to start before turning much more soft and delicate...  A bit of a chalky finish...  A really really good Belgian Strong Dark Ale, but a bit shy of the world class offering that I was expecting...","philbe311","Mar 15, 2015"

At ~ $5 a bottle... hard to not move on to other great beers, but a great treat to offer a friend out of a frosty goblet... and at 9.2%... you don't need to drink to many to feel content.","fulcrumbs","Mar 15, 2015"

Definitely some alcohol presence entering the mix.  Now getting some sweet nuttiness, and prune juice.  I would compare this to the best bread puddings I have had, contained in a glass.

Scent is of dark fruit, raisons, plums, prunes, cherries and figs with light spices and alcohol esters. Taste follows the scent with dark alcohol soaked fruit, christmas spices, brown sugar and alcohol esters. Snappy carbonation makes this go down faster than you would expect. Delicious.","FondueVoodoo","Oct 12, 2014"

4.75,10,,,,,,"In the interest of full disclosure I love strong dark ales of most every stripe. This is no exception, although I must say slightly drier than I had anticipated. The malts are still very much front and center, taste a bit like the other famous abbey product the fruit cake, but it is balanced by a a slight bitterness and the aforementioned dryness. When cold the high carbonation makes for a very refreshing sensation, as the brew warms the more caramel notes come to the forefront. There is little alcohol character, a truly dangerous trait in a beer this tasty. Complex and lovely.","Sumo_Steve","Oct 10, 2014"

The nose is nice and big with lots of sweet roasted malt, raisins, brown sugar and candi sugar.  The taste is very similar with a big emphasis on on the malt profile and brown sugar.  The body felt lighter than expected/wanted with a bit too much carbonation.  A tasty beer, but not as full as I thought it was going to be.","mtomlins","Sep 22, 2014"
4.25,-1.6,,,,,,"O: When it is poured into the correct glass does not have a large head but if you use the wrong type of glass then you end up with a 5th of a glass of beer and the rest head which takes an age to die down (to see what glass to use check the bottle). The first sip has a nip of alcohol but it is not over powering and there is a slight bitter sweet taste to it so that it is a very pleasing beer. But be warned this is a strong drink and should not be taken lightly. I like to think of this as the thinking manâs special brew. It also has bubbles so this one tingles on the tongue.","BeerDrinkersWorldTour","Sep 22, 2014"

Spicy, earthy, and the candy sugar taste gave the sense of licorice. I think that was the off-putting aspect for me. I spent the rest of the glass trying to focus on isolating aspects of the complexity - there are notes of malt to savor, notes of yeast to savor, hops to savor. But the licorice profile kept dominating. Got in my head and I couldn't get it out.","MisterGone","Sep 06, 2014"

Tastes of dried fruit with a bit of caramel and bread, also something like vanilla and the slightest touch of mulled spice and anise. A fair amount of effervescence in a medium body that leaves a a slight spicy note on the tongue. Very satisfied with this, a great step from the 10!","Phigg1102","Aug 08, 2014"

However with Rochefort 8 thereâs more of a drying touch that brings forth more of the flavors, and thatâs what sets it apart in my mind. Also, the nice floral alcohol is deceptive and pleasant. Curious about what would happen to this with some age. Went really well with some Cookies and Cream ice cream.","CowsandBeer","Mar 28, 2014"

Rich and sweet, but not overpoweringly so or cloying. Lots of flavors at play, but it doesn't seem muddled at all. I love the fact that it's so easy to get as well. Proof positive that something doesn't have to be impossible to obtain to be outstanding.","LambicPentameter","Mar 27, 2014"

4.27,-1.2,3.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.25,"BBD 9/27/17. Pours a very hazy dark amber with a slight reddish tint. Massive head and lacing that retains well. The nose is subdued, but of dates/figs, dark malt and Belgian yeast. The body is on the heavy side of medium with a nice slick mouthfeel. Normal carbonation level with a touch of effervescence on the finish. The wonderful flavor profile is quite complex, yet balanced. It begins with a multitude of dark fruit flavors - fig, date, raisin, plum - then flows to a mild malt sweetness over a well subdued alcohol phenolic note. The finish is smooth, yet also almost clean. A slight residual alcohol burn with associated phenolics linger a bit. This is the best Belgian I've ever had.","tillmac62","Mar 25, 2014"

4.32,0,3.75,4.25,4.5,4.25,4.25,"The middle of the Rochefort pack, poured into a Chimay goblet from the classic bottle. Sources describe this beer as dominated by dark fruit and on the cake-like, spicy side. I largely agree with this assessment. This brew is a dark reddish honey color, lighter than I expected, with a huge amount of pale tan head. These Trappist brews seem to bring the bubbles, bottle conditioning being par for the course. Initially the aroma is fresh fruit, like purple grapes, quickly followed by spicy yeast that recalls cloves predominantly, brown bread crust, and sweet dried fruits ... Palate is a cornucopia of dark fruit flavors, fig newton cookies and raisins, brown bread, rummy dark sugar, quite rich and sweet but with an earthy, woody, tannic finish that reminds me of strong black tea and rhubarb. The high level of carbonation and medium body mean this drinks like a less flavorful beer than it truly is. What really stands out here are the spicy esters ... Black pepper and a lot of what tastes like fresh cinnamon. The cinnamon effect builds as you go. Cake-like indeed. Fantastic stuff, and I maintain that Rochefort is king of the Trappists ... Or perhaps Pope? Hmmm.","CalgaryFMC","Jan 16, 2014"

The smell hits you with ripe grapes and then it turns into pear. The malt smell carries you right to the malty taste, which then opens into a ripe fruit mix. There is a big spiciness that follows the whole drink. I will definitely continue to get this.","TeamMathis","Jan 15, 2014"

Just terrific looking stuff. The nose picks up delicate but sure juniper berries with hints of orange peel and slight lemon grass and tastefully sweet malt. Enjoyable. The palate appreciates gin-like flavors right away through a medium-light body and the crisp feel of fairly aggressive but smooth, tiny bubbled carbonation. As it warms the warmer flavors emerge with pleasant caramel malt and grassy edges. Paired with the cheese of your choice this really becomes really special and so smooth.","Durge","Jan 02, 2014"

After holding in your mouth for a bit, the beer will PRY OPEN all of your taste buds, delivering a flavor profile of candied sugar, caramel, and dark fruit.

4.44,2.8,4,4.25,4.5,4.25,4.75,"Saw this at the local LCBO at $2.55 a pop...never saw this stuff so cheap so I picked up a pair. After letting it warm a bit I poured it reverently into my La Trappe goblet, raising a rich rocky tan head that sat atop cloudy brownish liquid tinged with amber ( I like to swirl and pour the yeast all in one motion) The aroma is of raisins, brown sugar and spicy yeast...a wonderful perfume. First sip coats the mouth with flavors of bread, raisins, and a great balance of malty sweetness with a firm but not assertive hoppiness...this is a very complex ale as are all the Trappist beers, a joy to sip and 'deconstruct' flavor-wise. The alcohol is noticeable as it warms but that's not deterring my enjoyment of this at all...very warming and satisfying, finishes on a bittersweet note, this one is hard NOT to just drink is a hurry but is so worth the patience as every sip is enjoyed to the fullest. Classic, delicious and world class.","beerluvr","Aug 18, 2013"

The aroma shows pears, apples, as well as many floral tones, together with a caramelized malt and, perhaps, plums. The taste brings a medium-body, extremely carbonated feel, with a caramelized malt backbone, and hops well present. There's a great harmony between the carbonation and the malty body, and the silkiness of the beer is impressive. Besides, the strong 9.2% ABV is not that perceptible. The aftertaste leaves both the delicious malt, a theme during the whole tasting, as well as hops. Despite being too strong for my personal taste, it was a great choice for the day!","HabiMendes","Apr 05, 2013"

Dark brown and very watery black between. / AROMA: In the first instant of pouring it into the glass, the smell is rum. Almost immediately after the aroma is strange, as spoiled rum, if such a thing could occur. Maybe that smell comes from alcohol. Unpleasant. Prefer not go nosing. / Taste: Creamy. Intense roasted flavors. In the back of the palate and throat leaves a permanent taste a little aggressive. Taste very conflicted: have to like it a lot or you dislike. Definitely something burning, as if I had grabbed the stew at the bottom of the pot and also, for some mysterious reason, that stew had spoiled bitter. Salted.

Its reputation is certainly well deserved. A lovely, understated, and refined dark ale with the perfect mix of fruit and bready flavors, it is pleasant and easy to drink despite its considerable strength.","hagbergl","Dec 26, 2012"
4.13,-4.4,4,3.5,4.5,4.5,4,"Pours a translucent, dark cider-amber color with a big, foamy, long-lasting light tan head. Bubbles migrate from the bottom, perpetually feeding the immortal head. Mild spiciness on the nose. A little metal soup can, date and brown sugar aromas as well. Mouthfeel is such that the beer slides. Just enough of a carbonation burn gradually appears to balance the slickness of the beer. Mild tartness in the beginning. Brown sugar appears just before the finish. A lot of balance in the beers flavors and mouthfeel. A very good Belgian by comparison. No alcohol warmth at all.","DocJitsu","Dec 26, 2012"

Exceptional retention, lacing that sticks to the side of the chalice and slowly slides down to rejoin the creamy head. Fruity nose; fig, date, hint of apricot, and perhaps some pear joined by phenol alcohol. Big malty body; spicy, dry, with yeasty pumpernickel bread crust. Brown sugar and pear, apricots, rich fig and date. Alcohol is ever-present but always perfectly balanced. The complexity of this brew is simply stunning and the balance is just as impressive. Medium-bodied, smooth with lively carbonation that pokes through here and there to tickle the palate. Truly world-class.","chanokokoro","Dec 18, 2012"

If, like me, you aren't a huge fan of the Rochefort 10, do give the 8 a try. I'm sure this one will work for you.","BS-","Sep 11, 2012"

The smell , the taste , the alcohol in this one is really sneaky , never guess that it had such a high content , no wine bottle smell in this. I can pick these up at 5 bucks a bottle , being in a small dry county in Arkansas this is a bargain with a 30 minute drive , but I pick my kid up at the state line anyway , I would love to have one of these with a nice filet grilled medium rare","ubenumber2","Sep 07, 2012"

I really wanted to give this a great review, as Rochefort 10 is one of the greatest I've ever had, but it seems messy overall in terms of conflicting flavors and thinned body. Again, this may be a bad batch, but I have had this at least once before and it didn't blow me away. It perhaps seems to be too middle-of-the-road in between 6 and 10. But no matter what, it is still a good quality product that should be tasted, as it is very popular and well loved in the global beer community. I just find that there are far better (and cheaper) DBPAs or ""imperial dubbels"" that can be found out there.","magictacosinus","Aug 31, 2012"

Taste is not at all what I expected, very unique indeed. Not quite sure what to make of it, it has this sort of funky creaminess with notes of spice (coriander?) dark fruit, soy, and some roasted malt. Mouthfeel is lighter than what I would have expected too, its somewhat light, compared to others in this style, very slightly syrupy. One rather pleasing is the aftertaste it leaves. Overall a very unique brew, not as pleasant as I'd hoped but certainly glad I tried it.","srv33","Aug 09, 2012"

Beautiful, mystical dark brew with the abysmal bubbles common to high-quality Belgian strongs bubbling up from the bottom. However, I didn't see the same alcohol rim as I saw on the 10 in this one. The smell is so intoxicating and invigorating as you pour this out, especially into the wide-brimmed goblet. The taste was superb with dark berries and cherry, and the 9.2% comes through beautifully in a warming way. I can only lower this ranking because I have the 10 to compare it to. This is an outstanding beer, and I recommend it for anyone with an advanced enough palate to really enjoy it.","shigg85","Aug 02, 2012"

Mouth is creamy and smooth, finishes spicy, warm, and boozy. Overall, great example of the style with nice complexity. I should have picked up another and let it age for awhile just to see how it comes out a year or 2 later. Either way, it's a solid Abbey Dubbel.","barnzy78","Jul 30, 2012"

I loved Rochefort 6 and am looking forward to Rochefort 10 so I was hoping for a clean sweep, but it was not to be. Like Westmalle, it's got some good flavors, but also like Westmalle, it feels like it had its butt removed. There's no substance to anchor it. The flavors fleet along the topside and don't sink in. It's thin and fizzy. The flavors are there but faint. I'd like to boil this down until it was more concentrated and then try it again. It's like a sauce that's too thin.

4.07,-5.8,4,4.5,4,3.5,4,"First off this beer is super carbonated. At over 9% abc i didn't think i would have to be so gentile pouring this beer. It produces a nice off white fluffy head that recedes rather quickly as expected with such high abc. The beer is a touch hazy, probably front he bottle conditioning. It has a reddish brown body, touches of maroon hues coming through as well. The aroma is very pronounced rum soaked raisins. it even has a touch of vanilla and maybe some creaminess on the nose. Dark fruit characteristics followed by molasses come through as well. There is a big boozy character on this one, and i don't really deduct points here because it compliments the beer and makes it much lighter than what 9.2% usually is. The flavors are also pronounced raisins, rum, and molasses. I get a woody character from the finish and it leaves the palate extremely dry. There is a huge level of carbonation on this beer as bubbles coat your mouth, leaving a stinging feeling from the alcohol as well. Drinks a little lighter than a beer of this high abc but nothing mind-blowing in terms of hiding the burn. Definitely a sipper. Overall this is a great beer to have and one of the stronger dubbels i have had. Really good treat and easy to get a hold of. Recommended.","Augustiner719","May 18, 2012"

4.32,0,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"330 ml bottle into chalice, best by 5/11/2016. Pours super murky dark reddish brown color with a nice 1 finger dense khaki head that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Spotty lacing on the glass, with a good amount of carbonation streaming up. Aromas of huge raisin, plum, grape, banana, molasses, pepper, clove, biscuit, toasted grains, and huge yeast spices. Incredible aromas with a ton of complexity. Taste of big caramel, molasses, plum, raisin, biscuit, banana, clove, pepper, and yeast spices. Lingering notes of dark fruit, molasses, banana, pepper, and yeast spice on the finish for a good bit. Great flavor balance and complexity. Medium-high carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a fairly creamy and slightly slick mouthfeel with a bit of prickly carbonation. Quite smooth to drink at 9.2%, but is still a sipper. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming after the finish noticed. Overall this is a fantastic Dubbel. Big complexity and balance; and extremely enjoyable.","superspak","Mar 30, 2012"

The head dissipates, leaving a small amount of lacing around the edge. Smells of brown sugar, fig, banana, plum, and roasted malts hit the nose. There are flavors of brown sugar, fruit, yeast, hops, and some alcohol, but it's faintly detectable. The mouthfeel is creamy and full and the finish is dry. The carbonation is abundant, but it serves to help enhance the flavors and drinkability of this beer. Overall, this is an excellent beer that I highly recommend.","acevenom","Mar 14, 2012"

The aroma is rather mild but pleasant: dried fruits, figs, malty sweetness, and light yeast character. The flavor follows suit with an immediate rush of fruit flavor that melts to the malty sweetness. Yeast provides a delicate character and works well with the sweetness.The beer finishes very smooth. Medium bodied. Overall, this was a good beer and I would easily drink again.","hopfacebrew","Jan 28, 2012"

Flavours of coffee and burnt toffee, strong boozey flavour of the alcohol.

Dissipated to an interesting ring of foam on the circumference with a big dot in the middle. Smells heavenly of spicy bread and dates. Alcohol presents itself right away and then yields to the sugars and earthy twigs. Malt. Banana and dried fruit sit on the tongue and frolic in the bubbles of the ultra dense carbonation that this brew displays. Tantalizingly smooth feel with a chewy sour bite on the jaw. Really well made. This is a bargain at $5. Can't wait till my next one.","JohnWaynes44","Nov 17, 2011"

Sweet candied malts are first up in the aroma with a milder hop note. The bidy seemed to be medium to bold. The taste also had a significant sweetness but it was both enticing and interesting at the same time. The finish was clean.

4.5,4.2,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"The beer is hazelnut brown, with a towering, frothy, tan cap. Plenty of lacing stuck on the chalice. The aroma brings forth yeast, malt, toffee, caramels. The beer has a yeasty sweetness to it, like fresh bread from a bakery, or perhaps a pastry. Delicious. We all found Rochefort 8 to be remarkably similar to Abbaye de Rocs Brune, which is interesting. Smooth, creamy feel, with minimal alcohol presence. While I do prefer the Rochefort 10, this beer is a gem. Recommended.","Huhzubendah","Aug 13, 2011"

4.45,3,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"This is a fantastic brew, and well-worth the cost and effort of locating a bottle.

4.85,12.3,4.5,4.5,5,5,5,"This a tie with the ""10"" and a very good beer. Pours a pretty dark reddish-brown with a very thick and foamy beige head. Aroma of chocolate, cherry, malt and cloves. Smooth-drinking, with flavors of banana, malt, sherry and chocolate all vying for attention. Great finish, if a little carbonated toward the end for my tastes.

Typically, as with many trappist brews, this thing oozes craftsmanship and tradition. Lots of sugary, dried fruits in the aroma: apricots, figs, raisins, papaya; bready with a hint of spice. Allowing to warm a bit before drinking, revealing flavors of caramel malts, toasted banana bread, apricots and figs, Belgian yeast, with a slight alcohol bite. Medium-bodied, full of flavor, and a pleasure to imbibe.","Rifugium","Jul 04, 2011"

Itâs certainly not terrible, but having recently tried the Rochefort 10, it is nowhere near the caliber beer that the 10 is, so it was a pretty big letdown.

Surprisingly, almost no lacing is left on the glass. Scent is wonderfully complex - lots going on here, but I'm picking up toffee, raisin, maybe a little plum. A tasty malty sweetness (caramel, raisin, plum) comes through strongly, with a slight touch of bitterness in the finish to balance it out. It all fits together perfectly. A mild alcohol taste began to come out more as it warmed. Mouthfeel is rich, creamy, chewy, and absolutely sublime. Just an outstanding beer.","DeltaGolfSierra","Jun 15, 2011"

I guess the best feature of this ale is the totally-hidden alcohol. I couldn't smell it, nor could I taste it.

There is a hint of funky smell coming off this one, just like the 10 I just reviewed. Taste is of raisin puree, prune juice, spices, and slight Belgian yeast. Again, slight funk comes through in the taste. Mouthfeel is extremely flat and thick. This does not work well for this beer at all in my opinion. Overall, this seems to be another bad beer. I just gave the 10 a horrible review and this one is pretty bad too. I bought both bottles from the same store. Both were stored in a cooler at a high end bottle shop so I am not sure what happened on these.

Smell is exquisite, with aromas of figs and dates, molasses, banana, spices, and malt. Taste is almost a good as the smell, with the sweetness of dates, molasses, honey, caramel, toffee, coffee, banana, and malt. Mouthfeel is full and creamy, with a punch from the carbonation, and a little mealy from the floating yeast. Plenty of punch from the alcohol hidden in the wonderful sweet flavor, a nice warming feeling from the first sip and flows over you like a large wave.

The aroma was quite intense of sweet chocolate malts and an earthy yeast with notes of molasses, figs and plums. It tasted smooth and sweet with a slight acidic-alcohol flavor in the beginning and ended slightly sweet with hints of chocolate, dried friut and a mild alcohol aftertaste that lasted quite a while.

Dances on the taste buds with dozens of flavors. Sweet, slightly carbonated, and smooth in the swallow, with a shy bit of warming character in the finish.

In the mouth, it's a medium body but has a really pleasing alcohol note that hangs out for a good long while. It's not abrasive, just comforting.

Nothing was overpowering - not the yeast, not the grains, not the hops but the overall package was very flavorful. Again, the balance was incredible!

I've had this before but did a hard pour before I knew better and all the sediment came along for the ride.

As I poured it into the glass the head started to foam over, so I slurped the head (grow up! lol) as not to spill any (it's not cheap) and the sweetness hit me right up front with the alcohol flowing mildly several seconds later. The sweetness gives it solid mouthfeel but not too heavy a to make it unsavory in any way.

4.57,5.8,4,4.5,5,4.5,4,"Bought this at Boonton Liquor Outlet in Boonton, NJ. Into a snifter, it poured a cloudy brown, with two fingers of tan head, decent retention, and good lacing. Smelled of lemon, strawberry, melon, caramel, and slight alcohol presence, but overall of lighter fruits, which was a bit surprising, given the dark appearance. The taste was a nicely blended mix of melon, strawberry, and tangerine, followed by cocoa/coffee, and then finished on a dry bitter orange peel note. Alcohol was better hidden in the flavor than in the nose. The feel was smooth, and not as carbonated, with a very bitter and dry finish. Very pleasant and complex yet balanced flavor profile make this one a keeper. Would love to age some.","donniecuffs","Dec 21, 2010"

This one boasts a 9.2% abv and it's not kidding. It's one of those perfect beers that will keep you warm on a rainy winter day like today. Only downside is that the price has gone up from $4.99 to $5.49 for a 330ml / 11.2 oz bottle. But, if you can find one - I highly recommend it.

The colour of the beer is a murcky, swamp watery brownish. The smell was of sweet caramelly malt with figs, plums, other dark fruits, some spiciness, and alcohol. The taste was about the same. I did have a problem with the alcohol taste, it tasted more like a shot of liquor in there (vodka) than the usual you get in beers. I also picked up some metallic taste and mouthfeel.

The mouthfeel is sharp and bubbly, but very nice with a slight warmth. The taste is sweet and sticky like dark sugars and cream with dark fruits and a slight nuttiness.

Tastes are fairly similar, yet in a slightly different order. The clove hits first, followed by a burnt caramel, dark dried fruits (I smelled the raisin, but the taste is of cherries and figs.) The finish is slightly dry, but presents similar to a chardonnay. It's a grapy bitterness combined with a bit of alcohol. I really liked this facet.

A thick malt presence in the aroma with caramel, cocoa, hints of toffee and roasted malts along with some breadiness and a touch of yeast. Fruit flavors are barely noticeable. Very sweet is the first impression I get. Creamy and smooth with a chocolate, caramel, toffee, and something akin to maple giving off sweetness and some bread/roasted malts balance and give off a dry edge. Some carbonation thanks to minor hop bitterness also lead to dry finish and there is a touch of fruit, like candy fruit or something, that is also in there (I keep thinking orange and grape). Touch of peppery spice as well. A real sweet but balanced ale that has a little bit of something for everyone and is just a must-try for anyone.","clayrock81","Aug 17, 2010"

4.12,-4.6,4.5,5,4,3.5,3.5,"Poured into a Sam Adams Perfect pint glass. Brown with a glowing amber color very hazy. It had a volcano of a head absolutely spewing. Orange/amber in color and huge. It goes away after about 10 minutes and there's a ring around the top. The smell is the best part in my opinion. Not overly yeasty as some Belgians tend to be in my opinion. A little malty with some smells of dark fruits and even a little grapey slight hop finish and a touch of alcohol. The taste brings it down a notch unfortunately, still ok, but nothing like the smell. This bottle is about 3 years old and according to the best bye date on the side, I still have another year and a half. The dark fruit tastes are not as strong and there is an earthy taste that provides a little more bitterness than desired. I don't taste it anymore after about 10-15 minutes but there was a metallic flavor that goes away once the beer warms up a little. The mouthfeel is slightly better than average, that same earthy taste makes it actually feel a little dirty which brings the drinkability down a notch too. I'm still not the biggest fan of this style, but this is certainly a good brew. The smell is the best part in my opinion. I'm sure I'll get it again as I expand my horizon's but for now I'll leave it as is.","AndyAvalanche","Jul 31, 2010"

The aroma up front for me was pretty much equal parts yeast and spice, with a hint of sugary fruits as well. And the taste, well it's pretty much exactly what a belgian ale should be. You get more of the belgian yeast and spices, as well as hints of cherries and molasses. All perfectly balanced, and the alcohol was hidden almost completely.

It's simply amazing: raisins, cherries, grapes and yeast come leaping out at you, and then an extremely potent cotton candy/toffee aroma last till the very end. The flavor is not as complex, but is very inviting, with porty/winey character. It's sweet, but not cloying, with very restrained bitterness. Maybe the best part is that its not to thick; a little syrupy, but overall finishes clean and easy.

This beer is not really anything special to the eye, so pour quickly and get on with it. Ruddy, murky brown with kind of a poor head compared to others in the style. But it is immediately redeemed by the complex aromas flying out of the glass. Malty and rich, spicy, raisin. Bready and yeasty flavors here. Spicy and herbal hops float atop a nice Belgian style malt base and finishes juicy and full. Nice soft sweet finish. A world class beer for sure, although I have a few, but only a few, others in the style that I would pick first.","twelvsies","May 09, 2009"

Moderate carbonated head mostly diminishing, but not as much as the 6. Lacing throughout as opposed to zero for the 6. I am drinking a beer that the gods long for! I agree with another reviewer - the aroma is pretty mellow, more to me than the 6. Malty, figs, raisin, alcohol evident on the palate and in the finish. With that said this is quite an enjoyable brew - wow! It has me standing erect and saying ""aye man this is beer - down with the wine laddie"". Do the monks drink this before, or after Mass?

Big time yeast and grass, floral, apple cider, dark fruits and a hint of boozy rum. Flavor is very nice. It's not overpowering like some BSDAs, but has a nice medium body. Flavor mostly consists of bruised apples and spice, hints of rum, dark sugar, raisins, banana, and has nice, dry, herbal and grassy finish. This beer is complex and very well-balanced. So far, I'm liking it better than the 10. It gets better and better as it warms. What a fantastic brew. I'm loving sipping on this one slowly even though the alcohol is barely noticeable.

4.45,3,4,4,5,4.5,4,"Pours a hazy dark red/brown color with some ruby highlights. The head comes up to about 1.5cm and is loose and bubbly, leaving tiny amounts of lacing from the swirls of tan bubbles that stick around. Looks like I've come to expect. The smell is deep and dark. A bit of bready malty sweetness, tossed in with chocolate, a hint of carmel and even dried dark fruits and esters. There's quite a lot to look for, and it stands up to my expectations for the style. The taste is nice and very complex like the smell. A taste of dark chocolate and caramel mixed together comes through first, with the sweetness if caramel beating out the bitter/roasted kind of taste from the dark chocolatey malts. I'd even say I can taste sweetened, very smooth coffee. Then I get a taste of esters, and the fruits: plums, raisins, but more like the generic, non-descript fruity tastes of esters. Then it finishes with a bit of sugary sweetness, but definitely not cloying. On some sips, it actually finishes with a little dryness. That's a quality I've really come to enjoy: being surprised by what I'll taste next. The alcohol is hardly present, but it warms a little. The mouthfeel is so full, and there isn't a thing, even with all of the complexity, that I do not enjoy in here. Goes down very smoothly and the carbonation is pleasant. The alcohol doesn't hit you quickly, and this beer just begs you to keep going. I think I like this better than the 10, and easily my favorite from the style to this point. I was happy to have it, and I bet you will be too.","taylorhamrick","Mar 23, 2009"

The flavor is absolutely incredible, I thought that the flavor was dynamic, the flavor takes it to a different level. Picking up the malts, they give a chocolate like flavor that was not noticeable in the nose, cherry is there as well with an ever so slight coffee flavor. What is probably a little crazy is it somewhat reminds me of a root-beer float with the end flavors and carbonation.

At any rate, this beer pours a beautifully dusky brown with a calm head. It's a nearly idyllic looking in the goblet. The beer looks substantive and earthy, like something that would be drunk at great feasts. The nose is wonderfully Belgian. There is some alcohol presence, which mostly serves the complex smells of fruits and malt. The taste is a highly refined caramel with an array of bitter and sweet fruits. It's a wonderful beer that deserves its reputation. It's certainly a heavyweight even in a style this competitive.

Intense fruit on the nose. mandarine & lemons, nothing like the caramel bananas I remember from last time. Malt aromas are poking through but it's mandarine all the way for me. Incredibly complex taste, malty, toasty, fruity, melanoidiny with a good boozy kick in the arse. Bitterness is superbly balanced. wow, this beer is an epiphany.

Fairly balanced taste, with maybe a little more malt than hops. A bit of alcohol warming going down. Nice flavor. Hard to find anything I don't like about the flavor of this one.

There is a certain bitter, phenolic/ medicinal grip to it that I find unpleasant, but in my experience that usually indicates that some cellaring is in order. These days I am leaning more towards the milder varieties - like the Rochefort 6, that offer the softened nuances and accessible complexities without the wait for the beer to mature.

I am a little disappointed at this juncture. I feel that there is not enough malty sweetness backing up the rest of the flavor and alcohol notes.

It could just be from the long Belgium boils producing a burnt/caramel taste from the malt. Or more simply just the roasted barley. Whatever the reason this beer has a complex taste. This beer has a medium body with vigorous, but on the softer side, carbonation. Those silly monks did a great job disguising the alcohol content of this beer, however the trade off is the pronounced burnt/smokey/roast, which also makes the beer go down a little slower.

The smell is rich fruitiness and malt with a bit of spice, a hint of alcohol and maybe a touch of an earrthy yeast tone as well. At first the taste this is a bit brash, spicy from hops and alcohol with the malt and fruit underneath. As the beer warms it tends to smooth out and blend a bit better and the malt comes out front and is it ever malty. There is a lot of dark grain maltiness reminiscent of dark bread with chocolate, under those there is a touch of what seems like brown sugar and coffee. When warmer this beer is nice and full in the mouth however it leaves surprisingly little aftertaste just a bit of drying and quick hint of peppery alcohol.

It was highly aromatic, fruity in standard and atypical ways, with citrus mixing with a slight nutty flavor, with banana and berry (cherry?) also represented. Yet the taste was sweet and smooth, easily masking the high ABV (9.2%). This presents the drinker with a lot to taste and ponder, and I'm both impressed and thankful for the chance to delve into this classic that's right up my alley as far as my favorite style, and what is often considered a legend.

Fizzy off-white head fell quickly leaving a film of tiny bubbles clinging to the surface. Colored a deep reddish brown that is not quite opaque when held to the light. Tiny bits of yeasty sediment show up suspended in the liquid. Smells of caramel with a hint of butterscotch, maybe some vanilla and raisons. A taste reveals a light mouth feel and a ton of carbonation. The 9.2% Abv listed on the label is barely noticeable though. Bitterness come though for a second then fades quickly to a warm malt aftertaste. Quite a bit lighter than Rochefort 10. I could drink several of these in a sitting. Not as flavorful as 10 but still very good; refreshing on a beautiful fall day. IÂll think IÂll get some more of this.","bwatson","Oct 28, 2007"

Smell is of alcohol, caramel, and toasted grains. Malt and alcohol are present in the taste along with a touch of chocolate, caramel, and toasted grains. I personally cannot detect any fruit other than a touch of raisin. Served cool but as it warms it leaves a terrific creamy mouthfeel that leaves a warming affect as it goes down, also leaves a slighly sour aftertaste.

Buttery malt becomes noticeable as the beer warms and breathes. Mild chocolate and banana are perceptible at first in flavor and are ensued by notes of darkly caramelized fruit and a date - like sweetness. Hop bitterness is only indirectly noticed by its offsetting of malt sweetness. Full in body, w/ a dextrinous, liquid velvet mouthfeel. Finishes w/ waves of dark caramel lingering. Alcohol warmth slowly emerges as an afterthought. Rochefort 8 is fabulous. The residual sweetness is well controlled and the combination of chocolate notes and fruit is superlative.

Tasted slightly of papery oxidation, more dark fruits( plum , raisin), and brandy soaked cherries. Also some sweet sugary tones,with some peppery spice and minor alcohol heat. Plenty of carbonation.

Good, but not fantastic, although I don't think I've had the 8 before, and preceded it with a pair of Westmalle tripel's, so perhaps I raised the bar to high.

Crazy bubbles. Rich, fruity aroma. Smells like a malty fruit salad. Oooh, this is a delicious beer too. Really fruity. Dark fruits with some mild spices (maybe some nutmeg in there?). Malty, with slight hints of pepper and smoke in the finish. Tasty stuff, this Rochefort 8. The carbonation ovewhelms the mouthfeel, but it does settle down after it sits for a while.

Although a nice swirl of the glass in a large goblet releases substantial flavor/re-creams the head (I recommend to continuously swirl the glass as you consume)... and releases the smell of bitter sweet pear/apple pie/faint cinamon and sugary infested yeast/alcohol remints. The smells definitely diminish quickly, but to get the initial glimse of them is well worth it. I liked the slightly creamy, and strong mouthfeel, heavy and bubbly to the tounge with a nice leftover taste to the side of the cheeks and roof of my mouth. Fantastic drinkability, could definitely sit down relax by a fire and drink several of these.

The taste is surpassingly smooth, sweet, and malty. It has definite peppery notes, and a lighter tobacco taste. This has a slight chocolate milk character in the finish, and some sweet berry notes. There's so much more here that I can't quite put my finger on! The alcohol is also quite well hidden. The yeast pour doesn't alter the taste for my pallette, since the dregs seems to be only a few small brown drops. The mouth is on the light side of medium, with a very smooth carbonation.

The mouthfeel was sweet and dry, great drinkablility for a 9.2% beer. The alcohol was noticeable, but not off putting.

Smelled sweet and grapey. Up front, the taste was neutral followed by a blast of sweet malts, then grains in the aftertaste, with very warm alcohol throughout. Midway through, the hop presence was greater than in other similar Belgians. Towards the end the malts took over again, which was more enjoyable in this case. There was also a tartness to the sweet flavors, reminding me just a tiny bit of sour apples and some berries. Mouthfeel was kind of thin.

3.75,-13.2,4,4,4,3.5,3,"Poured from an 11.2oz bottle into an oversized wine glass. Slow pour still produced a full two finger beige head that slowly gave way so moderate sticky lacing. Appearance is an opaque mocha colored brown with a slight reddish tint to it in the light and nearing the edges. Aroma smells sweetly of malt, dried fruit, warm sugary alcohol and has a yeastiness about it. The alcohol is far from hidden in the nose as it makes itself known in both the nose and in the finish. Taste starts sweet and rich of dried dark fruits, then nicely progesses towards a stronger yeast flavor than first introduced in the nostrils. This brew is able to keep one guessing when the alchol will emerge from the sweet earthiness and bite as it tends to fade and reapppear with passing sips. One sweet and seemingly innocent and then the next you might think you're dealing with far higher than 9.2% abv. Mouthfeel is medium body with an aptly paired moderate carbonation, slight roughing of the tongue as it then washes off towards the gullet with a more smoothing feeling. Finishes with a sweet dryness in the mouth, much like a dark espresso, alongside a minimal sweet fruity aftertaste. Drinkability is scored a little lesser given the seeming omnipresence of alcohol in this ale, either way, overall an enjoyable ale.","danielocean03","Jul 18, 2006"

Smell is fruity with bananas, pears, dough and sweet malt with a noticable strong alcohol presence in the nose as well. Mouthfeel is rather light and highly carbonated. Taste is absolutely incredible! Taste is dry with fruity notes, spices and chocolate that is followed by a long warming alcohol presence. High alcohol character hurts the drinkability a bit.

On the palate, fruity (figgy) sweetness up front and throughout, along with rich yeast and mild alcoholic burn. The fruitiness is surprisingly scant. Aside from the alcohol burn, the mouthfeel is only medium-bodied, but very smooth on the palate.

4.73,9.5,5,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,"This beer pours a dark brown with a slight reddish tint. A lovely creamy off-white head sits atop the body. Head gradually settles down to a thin coating across the surface of the beer that lasted as long as the beer did. Nice lacing, even in a tulip. Aroma is caramel, chocolate, cookies, some berries and dark fruit. Mostly sweet nose, but some roasted notes. Slight aroma of alcohol as well. Initial flavor is moderately sweet, cookie dough, milk chocolate, caramel, toffee, candi sugar, figs, and raisins. The flavors compliment each other quite well and are very balanced. The beer ends with warming alcohol, and a medium length, dry finish. This has an incredible mouthfeel, round, filling, very smooth and creamy. Lively carbonation dances on the tongue. Wonderfully complex, but without the hot alcohol that ruins the 10.","artusory","Apr 18, 2006"

4.18,-3.2,4.5,4,4,4.5,4.5,"This poured out into my chalice a touch lighter than the 10, showing more ruby and brownish deep red hues. Light purple in some light. The head is a fine layer of bone-white foam, consistent and solid, leaving screens of lacing. The aroma follows the pattern of the 10. The difference is more sourish dark malts here, pronounced more under less alcohol than the 10. The 8 seems a little more spicy as well, prehaps cinnamon or tree bark. Big hits of phenol and alcohol from the 9.2%, and light hints of ground coffee and dark bready malting. All the dark fruits are here, though less noticeable than in the 10. There are some leafy green smells in here too: celery, lettuce and roasted green pepper. Hits of charcoal above the rim. The aroma is always creamy and a bit lactosy with a sweetness akin to raisins. A complex aroma, though not quite on par with the 10 for sheer variety of aroma. Woody tastes at first in the mouth, followed by a big hit of warmth from the alcohol and intense spiciness combined. The finish is very malty and bready, like a handful of barley. There is a perfumey character to the whole taste, as well as a spritzy hair-spray bitterness from the alcohol. Some sourish malts at first too, and the best of the beer's taste is on the middle of the tongue, where the sweet malts combine with a delicate carbonation and a little bitterness. A bit of saltiness in the aftertaste, and very strong grainy/woody tastes. The carbonation seems a little higher than the 10. The beer warms the innards quickly and nicely. Full-bodied, though not extremely thick in the mouth. The 9.2% is masked well and this presents an extremely drinkable strong Belgian dark ale.

Well, it wasn't a ""down-buy"" as we say in Sweden. It poured with a generous and creamy latte colored foam. The color was dark, nutbrown and the smell sweet and fruity.

Alcohol is very evident in nose. Reminds of a port. Alcohol taste is very evident just like the nose. Taste is very sweet with lots of fruit and like a rum ball or spiced cake.

The flavor is very malt oriented and it has a strong malty sweetness in the beginning that is balanced by a light, yet noticeable, clean spicy hop bitterness and a toasty malt flavor. It segues into a fruitier drier malt flavor towards the end and it finishes with a balanced sweet/toasty malt flavor and a bit of hop bitterness to lend it a clean quality. It has a noticable alcohol level and it warms the belly nicely. This ale would be very drinkable if it was milder yet that would make it boring so I think for what it is it's drinkabilty is as high as you can get with this high of alcohol level and flavor.","RenoZymurgist","Feb 28, 2006"

Velvety taste, as the alcohol retreats in the beginning. Meduim-bodied malt character, slightly exotic and spicy. Again, spiced rum comes to mind. Some sweet darkchocolate flavors erupt as well ... blended with the fruitiness of the malt/yeast chemistry. Alcohol is assertive throughout, with a medium, to heavy mouthfeel. Sweeter than dryer finish. Little carbonation. In every respect, a great beer. Very, very complex flavor profile. and the smell is epic.

Aromas show dried dark fruits, muskiness, tartness,and a hint of chocolate. Flavors don't disapoint. Dehydrated fruits form pineapples to dates and figs. Rich chocolate and malts meld together, showing firm alcohols throughout (kinda like a bourbon ball). Heavy sweetness is balanced with tartness and woodsyness.

A lot of guesswork on this beer - the flavors are hard to pinpoint, but they smell and taste kinda like a sweet candy.

The beer also leaves and oily feeling on my tongue after I have swallowed it, perhaps this is one of the reasons why the taste still lingers in my mouth for a bit (longer than most) after I have swallowed it.

All that is left now is a thin ring around the edge, and a thin cirrus cloud of foam on top. Caramel, and dark fruit dominate the aroma, while spices linger in the background. It is not what I would expect from a Belgian strong dark ale, but it is not unpleasant either. The taste is quite fruity with caramel tones. Spices and alcohol don't voice themselves until the aftertaste. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with nice carbonation. Overall, this is not my favorite Belgian strong dark ale.

Little roastiness in the middle, but there is some nice fruit (black cherries and prunes). Even a slight hint of vanilla. Mouthfeel is full bodied and a bit creamy.

I have to acknowledge a deep gratitude to Stonecrusher who sent this (and the Rochefort 10) godsend to my doorstep. While this beer didnÂt make me cry like the 10 did, it is truly a world class beer. Even my wife, who only likes Lindemans Framboise and Corona, could see the exceptional quality of this beer.

There was a bit of yeastiness to it as well as a slight spiciness. Aftertaste was a sweet malt and spicy mix. Body was medium to full with a creamy smooth feel to it.

The smell has a little more plum and less of the hint of alcohol the 10 has. The taste is almost the same, with that same incredible finish and smoothness that I will love forever like a long lost lover. I find the 8 a little less decadent and more drinkable.

The taste was very good with plenty of the same spice in the smell, some caramel and a very slightly noticeable cooked fruit taste in the background of the finish. The mouth feel is awsome on this one! Very smooth. Heavy, but smooth and with a nice warming effect from the 9.2%abv.

3.93,-9,4.5,4,4,4,3.5,"The beer pours a nice dark brown color with a huge 2 finger latte-colored head that doesn't fall much at all. The nose is more sweet than other beers of this style that I have tried. There are some fig scents in there, but the sweetness of the malt is what prevails. After letting the beer sit, the head has fallen just a bit leaving a thick lace on the side of the glass. The alcohol is not hidden well in the initial sips, and this is not a flavor I like to have shining through in my stronger beers. As I let the beer sit and warm, the alcohol subsides and becomes more what I like. The fig and malt sweetness are there, but not overly powerful. This is not my favorite in the style, but still a good offering. The beer is a little thinner in my mouth than I like, but it's still good. The drinkablilty suffers due to the thinness and lighter flavors of this beer, but it would not be a far stretch to sit down to a few of them in a night.

Pillowy beige head that leaves excellent lacing on the Rochefort goblet. Complex aromas of yeast, esters, carob (almost chocolate) and gourmet caramel. This beer transcends words. It's malt profile is a bit reminiscent of a chocolate-like character, but more tame and subdued. Yeasty in the sense of it's unique yeast strain. Aging this beer really mellows it's characterisitcs.

The head was about an inch in height and died down pretty quickly. There was a generous amount of lace on the sides of the glass. The aroma was sweet-sour with cherries, licorice, molasses, and Belgian horse blanket smells wafting through. The taste was a balance between dark skinned dried fruits and dry peppery spiciness. The malt exhibited a roasty burnt quality, but not to a degree found in a stout or a porter. A more pronounced hop bitterness than that typically found in Belgian strong ales was also detectable. The beer was medium thick on the palette, and never felt watered down compared to its bigger and bolder brethren. This is one masterful brew thanks to those Trappist monks.

The alcohol is also much more noticeable in the flavor Â itÂs actually almost a bit overpowering in the first sip. The second sip, however, is much kinder. Bready flavors dominate, with a sweet malty flavor showing up first, followed by dark fruit, and finally a lovely bittersweet chocolate finish. A bit spicy throughout as well, perhaps ginger?

Alcohol warmth slowly emerges as an afterthought.  Rochefort 8 is fabulous.  The residual sweetness is well controlled and the combination of chocolate notes and fruit is superlative.
