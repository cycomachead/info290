It has a very deep and intense flavor that strikes all the right Belgian Abbey notes with hints of raisins, figs, and that distinct Belgian yeast. I remember having this on draft previously and it blew my socks off. The bottled version, while still fantastic, didn't quite blow me away. Still a great beer.","brurevu","Dec 12, 2013"

Taste is dominated by dry caramel malt notes with very subtle residual sugar notes and some bready notes. Body is about average with good carbonation and light warming alcohol can be detected.

Aromas of big banana, molasses, caramel, clove, pepper, plum, cherry, apple, bread, light fruits, and yeast spices. Some nice and well balanced Belgian aromas. Taste of big molasses, nuttiness, banana, clove, caramel, raisin, light fruits, biscuit, pepper, and yeast spices. Lingering notes of light fruits, pepper, clove, banana, and molasses on the finish for a good bit. Not overly spicy from the yeast at all; yet still has nice balance with no cloying sweetness. Slightly above medium carbonation and medium bodied; with a slightly creamy and slick mouthfeel. Very smooth to drink but it is still a bit of a sipper. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming well after the finish. Overall this is a very excellent Belgian style offering.

3.75,-5.8,3.5,3.5,4,4,3.5,"New Belgium's Grand Cru Abbey Ale pours a good looking clear maroon color, with some nice amber highlights that shine through when given the occasion. The khaki foam that serves as a head comes up to between two and three fingers in height on the various pours. Head retention is just alright, and lacing is very inconsistent. There's a nice bit of plum in the nose, as well as a markedly peppery phenolic character. Those are joined by a slightly abrasive fusel alcohol aroma. There's just a hint of caramel to play off the dark fruits in the malty opening. The booziness from the nose is still present, but a little bit more subdued. It also serves to help highlight the prominent pepper notes in the close. The body is on the dry side, yet with a creamy edge to it, really nice for the style. The carbonation is just a touch too flat though, which keeps the beer from hanging with the best in terms of mouthfeel. Grand Cru Abbey Ale is a fairly well executed BSDA. That said, as someone who lives outside of New Belgium's distribution range, I wouldn't go out of my way to get my hands on some more of this over what's readily available here in NJ.","axeman9182","Dec 01, 2011"

I poured into a goblet and couldn't seem to produce much head. Fine lacing sticks to the glass a little while you drink. It's sitting in the goblet with a nice deep red hue. This beer has a lot of flavors going on in it. Very nice. I'll have to compare it to others of this style, it has been so long I'm not sure how this beer stacks up to the the best of this style, however, I'm extremely pleased to be drinking this at the moment. What a complex, balanced beer! Yum. Sit's on the mouth very lovely.

4.2,5.5,4,4,4.5,4,4,"This is a hefty-looking brew—impressive lacing tops the dark amber, almost burgundy-colored ale. Hermit cookies, raisins, cotton candy, faint Band-Aid and green plantains. Creamy smoothness, a body almost like a fine sherry. Mildly boozy, alcohol stays mellow but very warming. Broth, bread and fruit, all of which are savory. Mild hopping, though the phenols help to balance. Plums? Ripe cherries? Sweetness is not overbearing; lots of layers peeling back here. Malty and spicy finish with more of that alcoholic warmth. Such a striking beer, but well matured—a choice pick, for sure.","BeerAdvocate","Sep 23, 2011"

3.38,-15.1,4,3.5,3,4,3.5,"Overall: There is a nice complexity here, which I appreciate, as it signifies the brewer's effort to make an interesting and unique beer.

3.7,-7,4,4,3.5,4,3.5,"O: An interesting beer, this ""double"" Fat Tire... the unexpected clovey-ness and spice bend this one from the regular amber version to more of a Belgian (hence the style characterization of BSDA, I see)","jpro","Jul 11, 2011"
4.53,13.8,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Poured into a snifter this ale pours a brilliantly clear deep ruby red with a long lasting off-white head, a beautiful beer. The aroma is rather malty and loaded with yeast character. The nose brings about dark fruit, especially cherries, a bit earthy, and lots of peppery, spicy esters, quite nice. The flavor is quite malty, rather toasty, lots of caramel, and some sweetness. The malts are balanced by medium-low hop bitterness and spicy/peppery yeast character. The beer finishes with just a prick from the carbonation, a subtle warming glow in my belly, and pleasant lingering bittersweet malt presence. The carbonation is medium-high and body, smooth and medium-full. Overall this beer is wonderful. A sight to be had, with great aroma and flavor to back it up. My one mistake was picking up only one bomber. Highly recommend.","uwmgdman","Jul 09, 2011"

3.74,-6,3,4,4,3,3.5,"This beer pours a thin dark molasses brown in color with a heaping cream colored head. It is very clear and translucent. The beer resembles a dark iced tea after the head dissipates. It smells of banana bread, cloves, toffee, molasses, and has great breadiness. The flavors are very sweet and bready. It's like banana bread in a glass. If I didn't see what I was drinking I'd mistake it for a light, light bodied dunkelweizen. The flavors are really nice but it's a little sweet for my liking. It drinks extremely thin and you can't detect any alcohol. It's also extremely thin, especially for the style. It's a decent beer but nothing special. At $7.99 it was worth it.","aasher","Jun 21, 2011"

I'd like the mouthfeel to be a bit more viscous, but this is a great beer regardless, easily my favorite new belgium brew. Other Belgian strong ales I've had have tended to stunt my palate with their fermented booziness that is nice for the first few sips and boring for the rest.

Nose is quite enjoyable with moistened black tea leaves, dark dessert breads, and a trace of juicy fruit bubblegum (in a good way).

This beer definitely goes a long way towards furthering that cause. This is an excellent American interpretation of the Belgian Strong Dark Ale style.

Maybe in the next 1000 batches they'll find they're ""old recipe"". The old recipe was almost perfect ""5" across the board... The current recipe is all over the board, needs to be honed in.

Poured a medium brown color, with a good off-white head. Aromas of green raisins, light brown sugar and Belgian yeast. Medium bodied and drinkable, with flavors of raisins, honey, bubble gum and spice. Very good, better than the regular version.","emmasdad","Jan 14, 2011"

Nose is sweetly malt, hints of fusel alcohol, fresh and pleasing to the senses; start is ambrosial, rich in malt and the top middling to full in feel. Finish is meek in its acidity, the hops delectable in their spiciness, dry and somewhat sweet aftertaste, and a definite belly warmer, still good after 4 years, well I wonder what it will be like next year?","Gusler","Jan 18, 2004"

4.47,12.3,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Pours a clear, very deep orangish-mahogany body that appears to have an almost burgundy cast in the full goblet; and displays some crimson/ruby highlights. Beautiful! Upon inspection, hundreds of tiny bubbles can be seen streaming to the surface, helping to support the short but creamy bone-white head. It holds fairly well, but eventually the circle cannot hold and it drops to a creamy collar and minor whispy surface foam. It leaves some transient spotty lace, but nothing of substance. The aroma, however, is much more noticeable and displays a softly toasted malt amidst sprinkles of peppery spice, dollops of dark fruit (prune, raisin, fig) and to a lesser degree some almost cake-like sugariness. It's firm body is rounded by the gently effervescent carbonation that caresses the tongue, and it's surprisingly smooth across the palate. The flavor is rich with maltiness that's at first lightly toasty with just a mild acidity; then soaked in ripe dark fruits; and finally followed by some peppery spice and alcohol in a long-lasting drying finish. It's really well-balanced and quite excellent! I'm immediately reminded of Chimay Premier, although this is softer; and the De Koninck Cuvee comes to mind as well. Wonderful. A real treat! The alcohol is extremely well-hidden; and it's drinkability is quite good! This is a beer that I will seek out to enjoy again and again!","NeroFiddled","Apr 13, 2003"
4.27,7.3,4,4.5,4.5,3.5,4,"Despite all the great characteristics to this brew, I was a little disappointed that there wasn't just a little more carbination in this one. Despite bottle fermentation, complete with a small amount of yeast particulate in the pour, it severely lacked in the spritz department. Not necessarily bad when taking the style into account, but definitely lacking all the same. It would be very interesting if they corked this one rather than capping it, and then letting it cellar for a couple of years to see the effects. It has great future potential but is still an enjoyable today just as it is.","49degrees","Jan 29, 2003"
4,0.5,4,4,4,4,4,"Reddish brown w/ a slight haze. The head settles quickly into a thin layer that leaves a respectable lace. Assertive bubblegum ester in aroma like New Belgium's normal strength dubbel.  In this kicked up brew the bubblegum ester isn't overbearing & is accompanied by toffee, a bit of banana, raisiny Special B notes and phenol; heaty fusels are there as well if you inhale deeply.  Quite complex in aroma-- I'm reminded of an overly phenolic & caramelly Dunkelweiss. The initial flavor is of sugary sweetness, but heavily caramelized sugar flavors from the Special B & dark candi sugar follow along w/ subtle chocolate notes.  The hop bitterness is virtually nonexistant & lends a syrupy sweet but smooth quality to this brew.  Banana flavors from the yeast persist from start to finish. Finishes sweet, caramelly, & with mild alcohol warmth. This brew could age for a while & will gain complexity through time.  This would be great with a rich banana split topped with chocolate syrup.","marc77","May 11, 2002"
