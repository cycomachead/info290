3.66,-1.3,3.75,4,3.5,3.75,3.5,"I got this at Costco in a 3-pack with two other Sam Adams BA beers.  Poured from 750ml bottle into small tulip.  A semi-translucent dark brown with small quickly-dissipating off-white head that leaves minimal lace.  Smell is of dark fruits, candy and cherry vinegar.  Taste is like a combination of Belgian dark ale and Flanders red and would be really excellent except for a slight mineral after taste that makes me think the beer is old or otherwise flawed.  Mouth is somewhat thin and fizzy but otherwise seems refreshing although seems to depart from style.  Overall, I would have scored this pretty high if it weren't for the mineral after-taste.  It's a confusing beer being that the label mentions ""Belgian style stout", but it's really more of a dark ale as there is no roastiness to speak of.","FFreak","Mar 01, 2015"

4,7.8,4,4,4,4,4,"750 ml bottle into tulip glass, 2012 vintage bottling. Pours clear nearly opaque dark brown/black color with a 2 finger dense khaki head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of big raisin, plum, cherry, fig, chocolate, cocoa, toast, dark bread, molasses, light coffee, pepper, oak, herbal, light funk, and yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of fruity yeast, dark/roasted malt, and light-moderate oak barrel notes; with good strength. Taste of big raisin, plum, cherry, fig, chocolate, cocoa, toast, dark bread, molasses, light coffee, pepper, oak, herbal, light funk, and yeast earthiness. Light fruity tartness/yeast spice on the finish; with lingering notes of raisin, plum, cherry, fig, chocolate, cocoa, toast, dark bread, molasses, pepper, oak, herbal, light funk, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice complexity and robustness of dark/roasted malt, fruity yeast, and light-moderate oak barrel flavors; with a great malt/yeast balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a very smooth, fairly creamy/bready, and slightly acidic mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice Belgian strong dark ale. All around great complexity, robustness, and balance of fruity yeast, dark/roasted malt, and light-moderate oak barrel flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the ABV. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Feb 07, 2015"

The flavors were very reminiscent of a trippel with hints of molasses, banana, some dark fruit (raisins?), some alcohol (expected at 9%). This had a rich mouthfeel, but again, not what I was expecting for a stout. Overall, this drank like a trippel, albeit a dark appearing trippel... not quite sure what SA's definition of a 'Belgian' stout is, but be aware that this did not drink like a stout.

The aroma is that of a Dark Strong Belgian Ale..a nice series of spicy notes hit the nose along with a alcohol up front cover...picked up a slight hint of chocolate and some oak from the barrels. The taste was straight Belgian Strong Ale with some nice spice, dark fruits and maybe a bitter coffee near the end. Mouthfeel is medium and right on spot, the flavors hang around on the tongue and gives a great aftertaste of spicy dark ale. Aside from being labeled A DARK BELGIAN STYLE STOUT it's listed on BA as a Belgian Strong Dark Ale...which is exactly what it tastes like, at 9% ABV it comes in where it should. This is a well made brew with a good solid flavor and would be great to share or use for a special occasion....as I did..good job and I enjoyed it.","Bear1964","0"

Not much alcohol and no wood character in their either. The bitterness is very low to nonexistent as this beer remains quite sweet and syrupy throughout. There is a bit of a pepper tingle in the mouthfeel combined with medium to low levels of carbonation the finish is sweet and then dry, rather unusual actually. Overall this is a bit of a miss to me. I'm just not getting enough of the classic belgian yeast character that I would expect for a beer of this style, it is missing the wood that should be notable in a barrel aged beer and the funky flavor is a bit strange.","fank2788","May 22, 2013"

The head is thick, dense and very creamy, very active with popping bubbles and it’s all very tempting… and it sticks around for quite some time too, making a great companion as you drink this beer. Lots of dark fruits in the aroma, raisins, figs, grapes, mild apple, slight roasted malts and spices are all present. The flavor is just as pleasing, malts are more present and the spices take the backstage in this part. Its slightly bitter overall and the sweetness comes out as you swallow.

Sam Adams claims that there are not to many Belgian stouts...well that is true but they do exist but none of them are like this. Most have that fruity like flavor but not this dry. Not this sour. I have has sour stouts and this is the best. New Belgiums for example was good but not sour enough. Fort George out of Astoria, Oregon was too sour. Other brewers in the USA interested in Belgian stouts have made very good versions, but this is on a totally different level. Could this improve? Yes. They could find a way to get the stout like flavors to be a bit more forward. Maybe not so dry but in its age at the moment, there is not bottling date provided (they need to start doing this), this is superb. Get this if you see it. Drink it fresh or age it...will I get this again. Yup and I will be pushing all my friends to give it a go.","Vancoubeer","Dec 20, 2012"

There's some dark fruits (plum and prune) in the smell as well as some alcohol. There's also some of that oak with some vanilla. But those chocolate notes from the malts are dominant in the nose. There is some tartness as well. If you took a Belgian strong dark ale and married it with a stout, this is the sort of beer you'd get. It has those familiar Belgian dark ale flavors with the spice and dark fruits. You get that oakiness from the barrels. Those stout flavors come through well too. I get that chocolate from the malt as well as those coffee notes. I get some of the alcohol, but it doesn't overpower. The tartness also comes through in the taste.

Head retention and lacing are both good. The aroma is nice, it smells like dark fruit, chocolate, sweet spices, vanilla, and some coffee. It tastes like dark fruit (cherries, raisins, plums), chocolate, sweet spices, oak, tart fruit and a little bit of coffee. However, it is a mostly sweet tasting beer. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit creamy and coating with good carbonation. I think this is a good overall brew, I'd buy it again. It was better than I was expecting it to be so it was a nice surprise! I'm pretty sure it was just $6.99 a bottle, I don't think it was any more than that.","bluejacket74","Sep 01, 2012"

4.03,8.6,4.5,4,4,4,4,"Poured into a Maudite snifter. Pours a very dark ruddy brown, appearing black in the glass. Healthy three finger light brown head with great retention and massive lacing. Aroma dominated by light fruit, particularly cherries and Belgian yeast and spicing. Light element of toasted malt; kind of the opposite I'd expect from a stout (as per the lable), but appropriate for the style listed here on BA. Pleasant, but surprising. Flavor is also confusing, starting with sweet light fruit juice, developing into slightly sour cherry, finishing with pleasant light and dark fruit with slight Belgian yeast and spicing. I'm not picking up much wild yeast funk nor much if any toasted malt. Not detecting the chocolate nor oak, maybe a hint of each. I'm uncertain how to review this; if by the lable, it is a somewhat of a miss. A stout with no toasted or dark malt flavor does not seem in style. Since it is pleasant to drink, I'm going to score it under the BA style of Belgian strong dark ale. Flavor is overall light, but nicely balanced and an interesting flavor progression. Body is medium with a bit of creaminess; nice mouth feel. A reasonable domestic take on a BSDA. Alcohol is well covered by the flavor. I recommend this ale, but don't grab one expecting a traditional (or even Belgian style) stout. The BA strong Belgian ale style is spot on. I like this and will probably buy it again.","LiquidAmber","Aug 31, 2012"

The taste is also excellent, this is a well-composed beer with layers and layers of flavor. Keeping that in mind, it's also smartly subdued, making picking out the layers of flavor a joy. It comes on with sour tart fruit, chocolate, and yeast. Sips invite in traces of coffee, spice, roasted malt, and oak. A masterful composition. The mouthfeel is lighter and well-carbonated, and the drinkability is good. Overall, this is a superb beer. It's just a joy to sip, it's got a lot of flavor dimensions without being taxing.

4.01,8.1,3.5,2.5,5,4,4,"Pours a solid dark brown color with a decent khaki head that shows moderate retention and lace. The aroma has a distinct lactic tartness to it that seems to overpower everything else in the nose. Faint hints of chalk and yellow mustard come out. The label says Belgian stout with notes of spice, coffee, chocolate, and oak I wish I could find some of those in the nose! Taste is a bit different than the aroma lead me to believe although it is a bit tart and funky. Deep caramel and brown sugary malt mixed with toffee and hints of chocolate start us out on quite a journey. Midway through we turn lactic with fruity tart and sour notes filling the palette. We finish with a bit of warming alcohol, hints of roasted grains that even show a bit of an ashy edge and a bit of caramel. Medium to thick body with a moderate level of carbonation and a thick sweet tart chalky mouthfeel. Uhm wow this is not the beer I thought I bought, but I'm getting that a lot lately from Boston beer. The nose is extremely lackluster, but the flavor is a huge explosion of ever changing flavors that wake up even the most sedate taste buds. I may have to pick up a few more of these for further evaluation.","johnnnniee","Nov 10, 2011"

Smell very little stout, but Belgian is the main theme. Raisin, clove, hints of chocolate, and a little bourbon. Taste is everything from smell with vanilla, figs, brown sugar, and some hard candy. Body is fairly thin for the style and abv, nice carbonation anyway. Not my favorite style, very much Belgian and little stout. That being said it is a solid beer, but if Belgians aren't your thing and stouts are, you may be disappointed. 85% Belgian and 15% stout, but I liked it a surprising amount.","SawDog505","Nov 09, 2011"

Head eventually settles into a consistent skim and a thick band around the edges. Arcs and spots of lacing are exposed on the tilt side of the glass with each quaff. Nose screams Belgian Strong Dark - dark vinous fruits, bubblegum, yeast and a hint of cocoa. Taste consistent with nose - more cocoa is revealed in the flavor profile as well as spice (perhaps nutmeg and anise) and a light, roasted quality towards the back. Mouthfeel is medlum-light with a slightly prickly carbonation and a trace of acidity. Definitely not a Belgian Style Stout; however, not a bad Belgian Strong Dark.

It isn't a bad beer, for certain, but rather more of a questionable one. At $8.99, a bottle won't break the bank, and will make an interesting beer to share with a friend (it does, in fact, become more of a chore if drinking an entire bottle alone), but coming from a company with coffers much larger than many smaller breweries with similar offerings at equal or lesser cost, it could use a little price drop.","superdedooperboy","0"
