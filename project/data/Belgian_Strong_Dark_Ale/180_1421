As soon as i opened the bottle i couldn't get the head to calm its shit. finally started pouring it. looks super dark which you would think would be a good sign. taste isnt all that great unless you like copper. and it doesnt feel smooth at all. too bubbly and feels more like drinking a soft drink. i disapprove...","Salsashark3d","Mar 20, 2015"

4.31,7.5,4,4.25,4.5,4,4.25,"Poured several fingers of tan head, great retention and light lacing. Darker brown and some cloudiness, with some orange shining through. Smells like brown sugar and malt with hints of apple. Tastes fruity--pears and pineapple, with notes of cherries and apple. Brown sugar appears most as an after-taste. Medium bodied and doesn't present much for a lingering sensation. Light carbonation feel. Overall, I like it quite a bit as a unique style, although it doesn't seem much like a traditional Belgian. Some sort of hybrid. Very pleasant, yet expensive, so I'll buy again, just not that often.","sporklift87","Mar 15, 2015"

3.75,-6.5,,,,,,"This pours a dark translucent colour with about a finger width of tannish head that stuck around.  The nose came forward with some dark fruit and sweet molasses and maybe a bit of maple around the edges.  I was really looking forward to diving into this.  Unfortunately was a bit underwhelmed with the flavour. Some of the same notes came forward on the tongue, but there was a grassiness that overpowered those notes.  I thought maybe I had the beer a bit too cold and let it warm up before taking some further sips.  This did bring forward some of those flavours but only slightly.  It was still a good beer but was expecting a little bit more of a flavour profile based on the nose.","Svingjo","Dec 15, 2014"

Smelled like prunes, candied prunes, brown yeasty bread, burnt sugar malt. Tasted like burnt sugar, burnt molasses, spiced burnt malt, yeast, brown sugar, pretzel bread, and brown spice bread; the aftertaste was sweet with an ever slight hop taste, but almost not noticeable. Just noticeable when the beer warmed a bit. The higher alcohol was well-hidden, but it came through just a little. The mouthfeel was full bodied but light a sense; carbonation was on the medium side. It wasn't dry, in fact it was wet; quaffable, definitely! This was a very delicious brew!","Jsteez","Dec 13, 2014"

AROMA: complex malty aromas with caramel and bready notes, mixed with faint esters and a background floral aroma. spicy alcohols present. no discernible noble hop aromas. APPEARANCE: deep amber color and translucid. medium ivory head with below average retention. some lacing. TASTE: mild flavours of toast and dried grapes. the alcohols are present with an almost solventy character, with spicy notes. low bitterness with a medium-dry finish. PALATE: medium-light body with average carbonation. OVERALL: a dark belgian strong ale that showed promise on the aromas but didnt deliver on the flavours. needs more complexity.","titvs","Dec 10, 2014"

If you don't like that flavor, it's still a great beer for tasting and craft purposes.","Gregg03","Sep 17, 2014"

Nose of dark fruits---plum and raisins, light Belgian yeast and Belgian candy malt. Taste is excellent. Plum and raisins sizzle into the flavor profile with this highly carbonated Belgian delicacy, cola and cherry tastes to the side. Aftertaste of cherries and cola. If one ever has a chance I would suggest trying it on tap----an absolutely fantastic Belgian ale.","Brutaltruth","Jul 20, 2014"

The aftertaste leaves a little booziness stuck to the back of your tongue. It's a pretty good beer. Not as great as I would have expected. The taste leaves a little to be desired.

If you are looking to get into Belgian Quads, Triples, etc. Try Gulden Draak, Piraat, Duvel. All will give you a welcome into the region. Once your "sweet rum tongue" gets used to the flavors exhibited.... the good ones like Rochefort for example... will fill your shelves.","ahommell","Jun 03, 2014"

It really was awful, it wasn't so bad that I poured it down the sink, but I will definitely stay away from this brew. I chose this over Delirium Noel and will stay away from the Delirium brand of beers from now on. I am now on the last drop from bottle, I was so upset that I paused what I was doing to write this review and warn others. For 5$ a bottle this is just no worth it, it would be worth it for 5 cents a bottle, save your money and try something else out.","AntonioBeerTona","May 23, 2014"

4.02,0.2,3.75,4.25,4,3.75,4,"Poured from the nifty faux ceramic bottle into a goblet. Color is a murky root beer brown with some reddish tint. Fairly aggressive khaki head that leaves a nice spidery lacing on the glass. Aroma is a well-integrated blend of dark fruits (raisins, dates, cherries), toffee, corn flakes, molasses, clove, hot alcohol. Smells rich and spicy, sweet and only subtly roasted. Semi-chewy or moderately thick body, coats the mouth and leaves a lingering sweetness along with an almost soapy residue. Palate recalls same elements as the nose along with medicinal orange, tobacco, chocolates from one of those mixed boxes (maraschino cherry in particular), wood, floral soap, sesame, light roast or green coffee bean. Wonderfully sweet, nutty, and dessert-like yet the alcohol burn intensifies as the sips accumulate. As good as its lighter and better known stablemate. If I was going to nitpick I'd say that the alcohol is a tad hot and spicy, but my evaluation of this characteristic is partly mood-dependent ... Sometimes the Belgian booze hits that spot square on.","CalgaryFMC","Mar 09, 2014"

Too many raisin, cherry aftertastes going on that feel like said fruits were dipped in spiked molasses. Very sweet. I really like the look, so bold and dark with ruby highlights. A head isn't needed. Sips like liqueur. And the fuzzy, bubbly sensation on tongue and down the chest is amazing. Warming.","shacawgo24","Jan 03, 2014"

Pours fairly crystal clear deep ruby brown color with a 2 finger fairly dense and rocky khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Spotty foamy lacing clings on the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of pear, apple, raisin, caramel, toast, brown sugar, chocolate, cocoa, brown bread, pepper, coriander, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of malt and fruity/spicy yeast notes; with good strength. Taste of big brown bread, pear, apple, raisin, caramel, brown sugar, toast, chocolate, cocoa, coriander, licorice, pepper, clove, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Lingering notes of brown bread, light fruits, caramel, toast, brown sugar, chocolate, cocoa, coriander, pepper, clove, and herbal on the finish for a good bit. Fantastic complexity and balance of malt and fruity/spicy yeast flavors; with a good malt/yeast flavor balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. High carbonation and medium bodied; with a lightly slick, crisp, and prickly mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is a highly excellent Belgian strong dark ale! All around great complexity and balance of dark malt and fruity/spicy yeast flavors; and very smooth and crisp to sip on for the ABV. A highly enjoyable offering.","superspak","Nov 01, 2013"

Tastes of well mixed version of all the flavours just mentioned, all hitting the mouth at once, followed by a sweet, then sour flavour, then a watery watered down version of the above which dissipates to nothing. Also tasted candied peaches, and a slight liquorice, and a medicinal flavour. Definitely sweet, but not overpoweringly in my opinion. Light to medium bodied. Low to medium carbonation.

The flavor does a good job mixing the black-licorice character with the more-common dark fruit elements. The anise character presents a nice dryness and spark to the mouthfeel. No real alcohol presence. Quite good.","Thorpe429","Feb 14, 2012"

2.23,-44.4,4.5,1.5,2,4,2,"I find this beer fairly unpleasant. It's interesting, but the yeast is just excessive. At least, I assume it's a mix of excessive yeast and some citrusy hops that's giving it that rotten apricot flavour. Whatever it is, it's over the top. It's starting to taste a little more like fruit and a little less like fungus as I drink, but not enough to change my mind about it. It's really hard for me to discern anything else in the beer. I'm not sure whether there's not much else to it or if it's because other flavours are just being overwhelmed by my dislike of this particular flavour. This is a little better than the Delirium Tremens, which had that same over-the-top rotted fruit flavour to it. This one at least is a dark ale and has some maltiness that accompanies that kind of flavour a little better than in a pale ale. It's still over-the-top, though. Won't be buying this again. This stuff ain't cheap.","ElCommodoro","Feb 08, 2012"

The aroma offers Belgian yeast, sweet malt, caramels, alcohol. Lots of yeast comes through. Sweet caramels soaked in alcohol. A present sweetness exists throughout. Distinctly Belgian, with dark fruits and light spices. Medium bodied with moderately high carbonation. Alcoholic warmth is there, most notably in the finish. Overall, a tasty brew.

Smells of dark fruits, spices, and alcohol and not much else. The flavors are about the same. This beer is trying to be a fruit beer/malternative but thereâs enough dark malts and beer like flavors to save it. The after taste here is just awful beyond all else. It has an almost medicinal and artificial fruit flavor. I can't imagine how this flavor doesn't put people off. This isnât good, it is frankly bad.","bobhits","Aug 07, 2011"

I can't really say much but find it. Its not a beer to drop what your doing and go hunt for, however if its on a shelf at your local brew store, buy it, its that beer that you "Just haven't gotten around to trying."

Each drink contains a pleasant mix of fruit notes and malt with a light hint of caramel. At times, the caramel leaves me wanting for little more, but other times it seems just right.

Really nice coppery brown colour, clear, except that giant chunks of sediment starting coming out of the bottle about 2/3 of the way through a slow, gentle pour.

Short beige cap, rocky collar, with a bit of lacing. Nice aroma. Alcohol soaked dried fruits, plums, cinnamon, sugary sweet, hint of dark malts and bread. Very sweet, sugary and malty with a lot of fruit character. Lots of plum and raisin character, moderate alcohol flavour and warmth towards the end. Toffee sweetness, bready malts, nice flavour overall. Medium bodied with ample carbonation, nice texture... except for the feel of big hunks of sediment entering my mouth. Not cool. This is a solid beer, but the poor sedimentation is a real problem for me. I can easily overlook a little bit of sediment at the bottom of a bottle, in fact, I expect it for certain styles, but this was ridiculous.

Good carbonation lends an almost "sweet grape" characteristic to the beer. It has maybe a little of that dried dark sugar taste of prunes to it, but not in an unpleasant sense. The aroma and taste are intense, and truly befitting the name. The silky mouthfeel adds a merlot characteristic, making it highly drinkable.

This sweet Belgian ale was great for a warm spring evening and was very easy to drink.

A little bit of alcohol hits the nose too. The taste isn't overwhelming like many of the Delirium beers, but that's a good thing. Initially, it's a relatively complex mix of dark fruits (plums and cherry) and caramel. As this mellows down the bitterness and spices really shine through with a slightly metallic aftertaste.

A yeasty, breadiness first hit my tongue as well as some caramel and other sweet malts, followed (and balanced) with some fruit tastes from the hops (I swear I picked up cherry along with citric notes such as orange and lemon). The constant carbonation keeps the beer somewhat creamy and fluffy and lets it pass smoothly even with some pricking down by the hops.

The flavors were equally loaded, black cherries, caramel malt, Belgian yeast, sweet esters some nuts and citrus rind. The citrusy hops at the end left a bitter note on my tongue that lingered on and on. The oak, rich malts and stronger alcohol gave it an effect similar to a bourbon.

This is a full bodied, yeasty, well carbonated beer with plenty of robust malts, candied sugars, chocolate hints, and dark sugar notes. What most impressed me with this beer is the beautiful and creamy mouthfeel. This is like milk chocolate on the tongue. The after taste is a bit too throaty for my tastes.

Taste was a small explosion of the above and as the drink warmed it mellowed with the alchohol more present and sweet malts. Texture was smooth , almost silky with little carb, medium weight. Aside from the sediment that slowly floated like stars on a cool New Hampshire evening the overall appearance was pretty average, striking shiny copper. Didn't know what to expect from this style but this particular beer is on top of it's game. Between the ABV and overall sweetness I wouldn't recommend this as a session but maybe something to start the barbeque off with. If this review peaks your curiosity, get up , go out and give this a shot and share it with someone who might appreciate it. Cheers!","ohoove","Aug 28, 2007"

Smells like apple sherry, a kind of fermenting apricots and banana mixture, liquor-like. The taste is sweet with heavy fruit but more of a grape feel mixed with what was noted in the aroma. Pretty heavy alcohol but not over the top. Still, between the alcohol dominance and the sweetness, I wouldn't want to drink too much of this at one sitting. Definately a taste treat, give it a try. I would buy it again. Quality stuff for sure.","Durge","Aug 27, 2007"

3.58,-10.7,4,3.5,3.5,3,4,"Interest in this brewer's creations began with my introduction to Delerium Tremens a few years back. Brouwerij Huyghe is a fine brewery and my experience with the corked and caged bottled version of this strong dark Belgian wasn't a disappointment, but it wasn't extraordinary either. I blame this on the fact that you can't tell the age of the beer until you remove the cork. In this instance, it couldn't have been more than four months old since it was stamped 2007. As such, this was a young brew which unfortunately wasn't mature enough to drink. Once the cork was removed, I understood what the notched January 2007 meant on the back of the bottle. The brewery should change the label to indicate the date is a "born on" date. Anyway, no turning back now that the cork is out. Another danger sign was the cork itself which came out bone dry and again spoke to the maturity of the brew. The color was a reddish brown and it was suprisingly and aggresively carbonated. The head consequently had balls and managed to hang on most of the way. As I drank more from the glass, the head became creamy almost buttery in color. The aroma was mild with hints of fruity, citrusy esters with notes of percolated coffee grinds and alcohol. The taste was carbonated and mild, with alcohol in the finish. Chewy and dry with coffee bitterness. The mouthfeel was dry and yet slightly yeasty up front. Not a viscous texture. This is a drinkable but somewhat uninspired brew, yet I will give it a whirl again after letting my next bottle age. Not as interesting as it's comrade Tremens, but still worth the price.","jim102864","Apr 15, 2007"

The taste proved this to be accurate. Their was the hint of fruits, however, this taste was accompanied by a maltiness and the caramel I spoke of before. I suppose I just missed this when smelling. Mouthfeel was good, nothing out of the ordinary, but you could feel a little citrus tingle. Very minor hang with this beer, which was nice, little to no aftertaste.

Fruity yeast up front (those raisins and a bit of orange) followed very quickly by a wonderful, sweet, carmelly malt. Aftertaste mellows into the more esoteric flavor components, oaky with a sharp slightly coppery (although pleasant) finish with some alcohol warmth. The mouthfeel is very carbonated, which I love but is not everyone's cup of tea (so to speak), oily and a little chewy at the end. Definitely lets you know you've drank something substantial.

Taste is fairly typical for the style; damp basement, stewed fruit, plenty of dark malts. Nice. I had forgotten how much I enjoyed this style. Taste is nearly identical to the smell. There is, however, a bit of a metallic taste present here, which I find quite odd. It isn't very strong, in fact, it becomes less noticeable as you drink throught the beer, but it is mildly unpleasant, but not terribly so. This is is lovely representation of the style.

Fairly light bodied, carbonation well controlled. No hint of alcohol what so ever. A nice Belgian ale. Quite pleasing minus the fact that no taste seems to linger.

At one moment itÂs fleetingly sweet, then refreshingly tart. The alcohol comes out after a few sips, but isnÂt present at the start of the glass. It certainly picks up a warming quality as you enjoy it. Finish is more or less dry. Medium body here, with very low carbonation.

Aroma is complex with a strong fig component, and a mix of vanilla and raisin. Palate is warming, with the alcohol apparent, but blended well with the beer's flavor and aroma. Flavor is very fruity, with raisin and fig evident. A little sticky and full bodied as well.

The smell was to me quite alcohol like and filled with fruits and grains. The taste was like the smell. Upfront it was yeasty and bready with a nice dose of dark fruits although I have to say, not quite as nice as an abt 12 of any sort. Also a mild hoppiness could be found, yet it played second fiddle to the fruits and sweet malts. Mouthfeel was good, although a bit too carbonated for my taste.

I'm not sure why I put this one off so long, and the pour made me wonder even more strongly. A lovely dark ruby in color topped by a fairly large light tan head with a smooth, creamy consistency. The aroma starts off strongly dominated by malt, with a slightly toasty overtone and some mild spices (reminded me of cinnamon and coriander) in the background. The malt and spice aromas seemed to drop off as the beer sat, replaced by a fairly strong tart aroma. Odd. Flavor hits big, sweet, and with more toasty malt. Very creamy mouthfeel, with a slightly burnt and bitter finish, followed by a bit of tartness in the aftertaste. A very good Belgian dark, to be sure, but not one which has many especially memorable qualities.","mzwolinski","Sep 01, 2003"

So far this beer is basically Tremens with some slightly burnt specialty malts, but the flavor just doesn't put it alltogether to me there is something lacking in this beer. Also the alcohol comes through in the flavor pretty strongly, a nice kick to the brew with the bite of alchol it delivers to the palate. Mouthfeel is medium with full heavy carbonation just a little too thin in body, but I would imagine in the bottle conditioning this beer would be fuller from the yeast. Drinkability well high abv is a strike against it, not overly complex, but this is not something I could drink regularly as a go to. It just doesn't do it for me.","WVbeergeek","Jun 05, 2003"

An impressive, bubbly head that lasts as long as any I've poured and is fed by an impressive eruption of carbonation. Fine lace clings to remind you of the progress you have made--as if the alcohol content alone couldn't do that. Smell is somewhat medicinal (presumably the alcohol) with spice present as well. Creamy mouthful of malty sweetness starts the drink and then gives way to green apple tartness which fades back to malt that gradually and subtly dries. Wait a bit and alcohol warmth becomes the most notable feature. More drinkable than I expected such a strong beer to be; goes down very well.","BitteBier","Jun 01, 2003"

One can tell this has a lot of kick without reading the bottle which tells you its 8.5% abv. Taste starts out with a cloying, sugary sweetness and is quickly disturbed by a very strong metallic bite, as if drinking Newcastle Brown Ale whilst sucking on pennies and quarters. Ends with phenols and dank, musty cardboard, leaving an unpleasant coating on the tongue. This is where you say "Ugh." Certainly not an enjoyable brew. I had much higher expectations considering the ratings here, and hey, it's Belgian:) My worst homebrew wasn't even this bad. Poured 1/2 the beer down the sink.

The aroma is comprised of dominant citrusy fruitness both of a tart, lime - like character and a sweet orange peel note.  As the brew breathes, peppery spice and lightly raisiny, slightly chocolately Special B malt aromas emerge. Surprisingly mellow aromawise.  In flavor, sweetness is of a dark fruit character, with date - like sweetness dominating.  Hints of caramel from the dark candi sugar along with a light cidery note are present as well.  Biscuit malt and a touch of butter surface as the beer breathes, and then become the dominate malt foundation.  Esters are subdued, w/ trace bubblegum present.  As the CO2 dissapates, the body is revealed to be a touch thin.  The initially prickly mouthfeel subsides into a relatively smooth one that doesn't deter from sipping.  Finishes a touch sugary, but otherwise clean and dry.  Nocturnum is surprisingly tame, and lacks some of the quirky intensities that other Dark Strongs have.  That being said, there aren't any flaws, the sweetness is well controlled and the drinkability is thus excellent.

Pleasant spice and fruit notes, suggesting coriander, but I could not really put my finger on some of the fruit flavors.
