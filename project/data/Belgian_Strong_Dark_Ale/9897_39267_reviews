"On tap at Jolly Pumpkin Ann Arbor poured into tulip. Dark brown appearance with a finger of off white head that leaves spots inside the glass. Aroma is funky, sour, cherries, and wood. Taste is similar with almost no sweetness. Medium bodied, active carbonation, drying and crisp."
"Poured a deep murky red with lots of foam to spare. Smelled like rotten apples, dates, figs, and sour grapes with an uncannily deep funk perfect for the cold weather. Tasted just as funky as it smelled with the Brettanomyces (I guess) and the oak barrel aging working its magic with the nutty malts to to create a magical flavor. Mouthfeel was just as strange and as wonderful as the beer's other characteristics -- heavy and boozy for a sour or wild ale, light and carbonated for a Belgian strong ale. Overall I love this beer with its perfect and wildly unexpected marriage of dark fruit and roasted malt with crazy yeasty funkiness."
"O: Tasty indeed. After trying many of the Jolly Pumpkin beers several years ago, I decided this was the only one I particularly enjoyed, at least for the price. I wouldn't say this is better than younger versions, just different."

"Looks like a brown ale, dark ruby with small tannish head. I get green apples when smelling this beer. After thinking about green apples Im now tasting them? Definitely starts sour that leads to the oaky flavor and stays dry on the tongue."

"Overall a nice sour dark saison/quad. Not sure exactly what this is."

"Overall:  Great beer."

"Batch 4. Overcarbonated (hello Brett!), but glorious for Christmas Eve! Brett beautifully blended with the dark ale flavours and oak.  I could drink this forever!"
""
""
""
""
"You can taste the barrel immediately as well as a dry, tart flavor. Finishes with a sweet, malty note of figs & currants. My bottle had a fair amount of carbonation too."
""
""
""
"This is an awesome beer for the holidays, or anytime, really."
"Red wine grapes and cranberries and a general dark tart fruitiness opens up sip by sip. The sourness gains even more strength than those. It isn't harshly sour but it seems to block flavors that might exist otherwise. Winey and Flanders Oud Bruin feel."
""
"O - The listing of this as a BSDA is a little misleading, though assuming that is what the style of the base beer is, I wish there was more going on with it. Definitely a good sour that is quite drinkable for 9% but it would be nice to see some more complexities."
""
""
"Aroma is floral and reminiscent of tart cherry candy, with a bit of a medicinal tone. Flavor is tart and sour, mostly citric acid, with a touch of acetic and lactic. Medicinal cherry weaves throughout, but that tart and sour cherry character redeems."

"Dark brown pour with a two-finger beige head. Aroma is strong with notes of oak and tart dark fruit. Taste is wonderfully sour and tart with dark fruit (raisins, fig, blackberry) upfront backed by a bit of clove and cinnamon. Medium bodied. Tartness and booziness increase as the beer warms. Finishes with a mild tartness. Really well done. Delicious."

"Green capped 750 ml bottle from Gator Beverage, Batch 165, 167, 172, 174, dated 10/23/13 poured into Unibroue tulip on 5/12/14. Pours opaque brown that turns a bright ruby color when held up in the light. Big fluffy off white head that lingers for a good while. Aroma is sour cherries, some dark fruit, light spice, oak. I was expecting something different but this smells excellent. The flavor is chocolate covered cherries, light spices, a hint of balsamic vinegar, dry oaky finish. Sweet around the edges of the tongue. Medium bodied with effervescent carbonation. Goes down pretty easy. I really didn’t know what to expect from this brew, but it is really nice and seems pretty unique. I would have this again."
"O-Overall it was surprising to taste sour had to get use to it. I wouldn't have for a holiday ale."

"Overall I thought this was a very nice beer and I thought it was a pretty good example of a sour, BA has it listed as a Belgian Dark Strong Ale, but other then the light toasted malt aspect I don't find this beer to match up with the style, but I think it fits pretty well as a Sour or American Wild Ale. This beer had good drinkability, it was smooth, pretty crisp, a little prickly, a little refreshing, not too acidic, not too filing and the taste did a nice job at holding my attention, Drinking a whole bottle might be a little too much for me, but I think splitting it with someone is perfect. The flavor doesn't really come off as too winter seasonal like and I think this beer would be nice to have in the summer. What I like the most about this beer was the balance, nothing was too overpowering and the flavors seemed to work pretty well together. There wasn't anything that I disliked about this beer, I thought it was great just the way it is and I can't think of anything to improve it. I would buy this beer again and I wouldn't mind keeping a couple bottles around in the cellar. I would recommend this to anybody who like sours or American Wild Ales. All in all I was a little impressed with this beer and I'm glad I decided to revisit it, I don't know why I don't remember much about it from the first time I had it, I find it to be a pretty memorable beer now. This isn't my favorite Jolly Pumpkin beer, but it's up there as one of the better ones I've had from them and i would say it's above average as far as Wild Ales go. Great job guys, this was a really nice beer, keep up the great work."

"This was definitely one of the better ones of the night, and a lot of it owes to the tremendous balance given between the malts and spices as they fight over the rapidly shifting funky yeasty notes. This is definitely what the old school Xmas beers must have tasted like in the era of farmhouse ales. The results are very intriguing, and done quite well. I'm looking forward to trying more from Jolly Pumpkin."

"750 ml bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 10/20/2011. Pours slightly hazy deep ruby red color with a 2 finger dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with some light streaming carbonation. Aromas of strawberry, cherry, green apple, raisin, orange zest, caramel, toast, oak, clove, nutmeg, pepper, hay, grass, herbal, light funk, and yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of fruity/spicy yeast, oak, and spice notes; with good strength. Taste of strawberry, tart cherry, green apple, orange zest, raisin, caramel, toast, nutmeg, clove, oak, pepper, hay, grass, light funk, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Light fruity tartness/spiciness on the finish; with lingering notes of strawberry, cherry, green apple, orange zest, raisin, caramel, toast, nutmeg, clove, pepper, hay, grass, herbal, light funk, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and complexity of fruity/spicy yeast, oak, and spice flavors; with a nice balance of fruit/spiciness and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, crisp, and lightly prickly mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice Belgian dark ale. All around nice balance and complexity of yeast, oak, and spice flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the ABV. A very enjoyable offering."

"Overall sadly the beer guys told me the distributor was going to quit carrying Jolly Pumpkin for them. Hopefully someone will pick it up as I love these guys."
"A bit oaky overall pleasant. Not one of my favs from jp but still well crafted. Full carbonation adds to carbonation levels. The malt character is softer then expected. For something in this similiar style."
""
""
""
"Drinkability: High (subject to the slow sipper caveat above), and perfect for a cold night."
""
""
""

""

"This surprised me as it was more subdued in its sour or wild aspects. This enabled more of the flavors to come out and make it an enjoyable experience."
"Overall. As I mentioned, this is an interesting beer and get's an extra .25 overall for that. Probably not something I would seek out again but an enjoyable, and somewhat complex brew. Always great to try something different (and sour)."
""
""
"Pours dark brown with a reddish hint in color; 2+ fingers of off-white, foamy head that dissipates quickly. The nose is tart and sour up front with raisins, nutmeg and cinnamon; a bit of bread and some farm funk. The taste is similar to the smell and is tart/sour initially but still retains some malt sweetness; a bit woody. There is lots of carbonation and a medium body, light and bubbly but lacking a bit of body. A tasty beer with a nice balance of sourness, malt and holiday spice."

"This is a solid beer that seems to be a shelf-turd at almost every store. JP nailed this brew and couldn't have done it too much better. Highly recommended, but I'm not sure I'd let it go too much longer than 3-4 years. I will be seeking 1-3 bottles per year from now on to make sure it's always on hand. Keep em' coming JP!!!"

"on tap at hops and pie, and absolutely world class establishment. a semi sour holiday brown here, not quite in the oud bruin tradition, but certainly on that block. hazy brick red to brown in color, lasting white head half in inch high. smells like lactic acid, lemon zest, chocolate malt, and something asian. its a very strange combination, but its cohesive and it works. there is a little more grounding in the taste, with the brown ale type malt bill and the souring fermentation goodies taking center stage, but it does have some dried cherry sweetness in the finish, as well as a subtle spice that may well be from the yeast or some rye malt. lots going on here, and it all fits together rather well. i like jolly pumpkins holiday or seasonal beers, they are all so well thought out and unique. there really isnt much like this on the market. tart and sour in the finish, but drinkable still at 9% abv. the feel is a little off for me though, it sort of curdles in the stomach, and as such is a slow sipper. maybe its the acid, maybe its the sugar, but its a little harsh once its down. medium body, maybe more, and excellent carbonation, it still feels slightly heavy. jolly pumpkin can do no wrong for me though, and this is even more far out than the bam stuff, its really different and well done."
"Pours a surprisingly almost clear dark brown, reddish dark brown in the glass with two fingers thick cream colored head, spray of delicate lace for the first few inches. Smell: plum, dates, baking spices, brown bread, acetic, vinous and oaky. Taste: red grapes, plum, brown sugar, clove, cinnamon, grape skin, vanilla note, cranberry-like acidity. Medium body, sweet with dry finish; fruity and mildly funky with nice contribution from the oak."
"O- I was not expecting a sour ale, but it was quite enjoyable."
""
"Not your everday strong dark ale but whatever it is, it's quite tasty."
""
""
""
""
"O - I love this beer. I have been a fan since I first tried it a couple/few years ago. It is probably my favorite Jolly Pumpkin beer, and I like pretty much all of their stuff (besides the price)."
""

"O- It is getting better as it warms up. Finish is slightly weird."

"Very good beer. Maybe I’m just not quite in love with sours as others are. Enjoyable, but it’s pricey as hell, and not something I could drink a lot of."
"O. This sour screams Christmas. Slightly hoppy and peppery but certainly sour. The appearance is excellent. One of my favorite jp ales."

"Overall: This was a surprise! I was expecting a spicy, sweet BSDA. The aroma gives a hint of sourness just not enough to tell you this is a sour beer. This beer finishes sweet, almost like drinking Sweet-Tart candy. This brew is good and interesting. I will not buy again, but I do enjoy this brew. If you like Sours, this beer is recommended. If you don't like Sours, this one is still worthy!"

"Atmosphere is really good here. Great head, and some great lacing. Nose is malty, fruity, and spicy. Very complex and well-balanced. Syrupy malt, with some fermented fruit, and some triple sec. Overall, this is a great quaff."

"O: I knew I wanted to try this wonderful brew since I first layed eyes upon this bottle at a specialty beer bar in SF. I took a mental picture of the bottle and remembered the name, ""Noel de Calabaza"". A Christmas specialty ale by Jolly Pumpkin, I could not pass this up when I saw it at my favorite bottle shop near work, Jane's Beer Store. It was kinda pricey so I held off until just one bottle remained, now I'm having it after three months after buying. I could not justify trying this jewel until a special occasion. Thankfully this week was good enough and god-damn am I glad I finally found the excuse to try this.... I've always been a fan of Jolly Pumpkin and had great expectations for this brew but never would I have imagined this being one of my favorite beers. Really, it is that good. I will never walk by this beer and not pick one up. All I have to say is I can;t believe I had this thing stored for so long, ignorance is a bliss until you realize what you've been missing. Damn, I'm enjoying this...."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A great holiday offering! Sour Christmas ales are uncommon and this one is certainly worth a try."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- pretty good beer, about par for the course for JP"
""
"O: This has to be my least favorite of the Jolly Pumpkin line up. I was excited to see the holiday special brew but It was not the present i was expecting. Not a terrible creation but seems messy and unrefined. Must have been made by south pole elves...Can't expect everything to shine like the northern star. Cheers!"
""
"What a great, bready, fruity, yet sour and clean beer. This is one of Jolly Pumpkin's best efforts. The bitterness lingers but was never overwhelming. Well done."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Perfect Winter Ale."
""
""
""
"This cola colored brew is a nice combination of green apple tart and fruit rind bitter. It pours with a small mocha head that dissipates as it rests; the luxurious lacing remains constant. The nose is a bit soapy with some vinegar and malt present. The mouthfeel is sticky and dry. Serve it cold and take your time in drinking, it slowly evolves into a very nicely crafted brew. I look forward to having it again."
""
"Overall: this is a pretty good beer, but it's not among my favorite BSDAs. I think it's just a little harsh; perhaps some age would have improved it."
""
""
""
"Pours a deep, dark cola brown with an off white one finger head that quickly dissipates and reduces to a thin ring of foam. Light oak, whiffs of red wine vinegar, light caramel and a touch molasses on the nose. Brown sugar, overripe dark berries, some spiciness including cinnamon and nutmeg. Some yeasty esters midpalate, tart granny smith apple and caramel malt join in; Finishes with pleasant oakiness, and just the right of vinegary tartness to lightly pucker the mouth. Heavy medium to light full smooth, silky body. Light, but fizzy carbonation. This is one complex brew that has a lot going on, yet all the parts collaborate and come together as a cohesive whole. Excellent twist on the traditional Belgian Strong Dark Ale hoilday brew."
""
"O: I really enjoyed this beer. I have come to expect big things from Jolly Pumpkin and was not let down on this one. A very nice dark sour for the winter months. This was a nice change of pace from typical American and Belgian X Mas spiced ales. Definitely a sipper."

"Pours a lighter cola color with light highlights visible around the edges. There is a thin white head which recedes to skim with some lacing present. The aroma is of dark fruits and sour up front with a slight hint of oak at the back. The taste starts with a sour lactic taste green apples red grapes and present. The middle has a dark fruit taste and then the back end has an oak slightly off putting taste. It was just there kinda unblended. The mouthfeel is moderatley carbonated. Overall it was an okay beer, i am usually a fan of jolly pumpkin but this one left me wanting more out of it."
""
""
"While I'm glad I tried it I would never seek this out and I wish I would have only bought one. My least favorite offering from the folks at JP."
"O - good example of the style."
""
"Where I often feel that Jolly Pumpkin ales are tilted too much toward the phenolic peppery and medicinal side, Noel De Calabaza balances out wonderfull and does so in the vein of stronger Belgian oude bruins."
"Overall much funkier than I anticipated. Would recommend this to anyone into Flanders or Wilds. Not for the faint of tart."
""
""
""
""
"O- this is one of my favorite sour beers, especially nice around Christmas, I try to drink as much of this as possible when available, a must try if you're a fan of sours"
""
""
""
"O- Noel is an amazing Christmas brew. I am really enjoying the tart flavors all over this brew. I think I am going to try and have one of these every single Christmas"
""
""
""
"D: very tasty stuff. just enough acidity to keep it highly drinkable. not sure how much the time helped the brew, but a good holiday sipper."
"O-what a great beer. tastes like a mesh of american wild ale and american stout. it's a unique and awesome beer. great for a nice christmas eve! goes down quite easily."
"Overall really liked the oak ascent, thought it was nice for the style. I'm just not a huge fan of these dry spicy style belgians despite the nice sour tart highlights."
"Poured from the bottle into a tulip glass, the appearance was a reddish brown color. It exhibited a modest level of carbonation and a slight white head. A grape-like aroma was obvious, though it was the more tart elements of the grape as opposed to grape candy. In the initial taste, one gets a generous taste of sour grape, woodiness, and a mild hoppy bite. A modest level of carbonation exists, sweeping the taste toward the aftertaste. As drinkers progress toward the aftertaste, the alcohol is more noticeable, yet it lacks any significant burn. In the aftertaste, one gets the tart taste of grape skin with a little bit of spice. I am not certain what makes this a holiday beer, but I enjoyed it a great deal."

"O: a different twist on this style and its quite enjoyable. I was expecting a bit more malt sweetness, instead it was more funkiness, slight tartness. its a nice blend, just wish the fruits were a little more prominent."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Deep brown with a dense and lasting head of khaki foam. Subtle but excellent malt complexity - treacle, caramel, shortbread. Hops are mild with just a hint of spicy earthiness. Rose water, clove, and cinnamon follow the holiday theme. A light lactic twang and earthy leather note let us know this is from Jolly Pumpkin. Really well done."
""
""
""
"O: An okay beer here - Belgian Dark are not necessarily my thing, but such goes life. Fun to try and decently executed."
""
"I like it! Interesting, simple and balanced. Extra ""overall points"" for going sour."
""
"O: If only more Belgian Dark strongs were soured."
""
"Very enjoyable funky winter ale."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, Jolly Pumpkin's beers rarely blow me away, but they're always enjoyable. This follows the same pattern and is one that I probably will not revist anytime soon. While it is advertised as a Belgian Christmas ale, many of the traditional dark fruits, caramelized malts and underlying spice are lost by the overcarbonation and Brett yeast presence."
""
"O - awesome balance on this one. Sour is definitely present all the way through, but balance is so that oakey fruit comes throughout as well. Definitely would get this one again!"
"O-an interesting Strong Dark Ale with unique flavors which are well-balanced"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The body is light with sharp carbonation. Overall this one is pretty good. Seems to hold up well."
""
""
"O: A delicious Christmas beer that remains quite enjoyable on this early summer night. True to style; in this case meaning this could pass for a fine Belgian brew but has its own distinct sensory profile."
""
""
""
"Overall, I was very surprised by this brew. I have thoroughly enjoyed every Jolly Pumpkin beer that I have had. I guess the ""Belgian Dark Ale"" through off my expectations a little bit... this was not your typical Belgian Dark Ale. I loved Jolly Pumpkins take on this and I will definitely be seeking one out for the winter."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is my first offering from Jolly Pumpkin, and I can say that I'm a big fan. BSDA's aren't really my favorite, but this one might just change my mind. It has everything you'd want in a good BSDA. Solid in every aspect. I look forward to trying others from Jolly Pumpkin."
""
""
"Overall this beer is still really good. Not worth the price tag of $18.00 though that's getting a bit outrageous I think. Still Jolly Pumpkin remains on of my top favorites in the united states."
""
""
"O - Not a bad beer, but one I wouldn't rush to get back to. I like my holiday beers to be a specific way and I think the sour treatment takes away a bit from this one for me."
""
""
"Batch 897 bottled on 9-27-2011. Pours a dark brown color with a hefty head of big bubbles on top and small bubbles on the bottle. Carbonation constantly rising throughout the pour and well afterwards. Scent is loaded with yeast, some floral hints as well as citrus. Taste is tart like that of pears and sour apples. Texture is creamy and filling. Finishes with a bitter/tart after taste. Not noticing too much of the oaky taste but I’m sure the aging in oak did this beer wonders. A great, full-bodied, refreshing beer. Now if they only they sold Jolly Pumpkin beers where I live, I’d be set!"
"Medium bodied, fairly high carbonation. Lighter than an other 9% Belgian Dark Ale I can think of, but not exactly easy to drink - really gives your palate the business. Drinkability is more like a 3.75. I'd definitely have it again if the opportunity presented, this time maybe not as a nightcap at the end of a fairly long tasting."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A delicious and welcome sour departure from typical Christmas beers (although I love them too!)"
"Hazy, dark, reddish-brown appearance: when poured into a standard tulip glass produced a monster head. 4 to 5 inches of off white foam. Even with a softer pour on subsequent attempts from a bomber, massive carbonation persists. Sour aroma dominates. Taste is primarily sour cherries and malt. Lasting afterimage on the tongue of vinegar/acetic acid. Becomes more complex as it warms. I'm more of a hop monger but still found this very interesting."
""
"It's a little under carbonated. Clean finish. The sourness isn't overwhelming, which is good because I'm still adjusting to this style. but this was a bit different for a ""Christmas"" beer and the cherry flavor adds a nice touch. A little overpriced."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I love sours and I enjoy what Jolly Pupmkin does with beer. This beer is very complex, nuanced and enjoyable to drink"
"Bottled on 10/20/2011.I know it's a little late for a CHRISTmas season beer but I gotta good deal today on this home state beer.Poured into an Ommegang chalice a true to label deep mahogany with a thinner slight off white head atop.Oaked sherry vinegar aromas along with some sour/lactic notes,a bit of dried cherry as well.Spiced phenols and that sherry vinegar on the palate,a sharp sour bite hits in the finish.For those who like the sour biting somewhat heavy handed phenolic Belgian darks this is for you,(and there are many)but for me I respect it but don't go outta my way for it."
"This was a strange beer, but it worked. A bit different than other beers of the type, something making it more American than Belgian."
""
""
""
""
"Undercarbonated, slick, and medium-to-full bodied, this doesn't really hit the mark for a BSDA. Short on the complexity, short on the texture, and short on carbonation, it's no wonder this one falls short."
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied overall with carbonation being above average. Overall it was a very nice beer. I really liked the sour cherry component to it, but it also didn't overwhelm you with the sourness. Really nice mix of flavors overall with some good depth and complexity."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-very interesting beer. defintely a unique version of the style. If it wasn't so expensive I would try it again"
"O: I was really looking forward to this beer but was ultimately disappointed due to the tart finish"
"Flavor is upfront malty-spicy, with an extremely nice sour component. An amalgam of several great Belgian styles, somehow it is balanced and beautiful to drink. Great stuff!!"
"O- Good but not great, very interesting but not the best from jp."
""
""
""
"Cost: $15.99 for a 750 ml bottle."
""
""
"Pours a murky dark brown with a 2 inch puffy khaki head that settles to a film on the top of the beer. Random splotches of lace stick to the sides of the glass on the drink down. Smell is pretty funky/sour with some dark fruit, unknown spices, and woody aromas. Taste is also funky/sour with dark fruits, sour berries, earthy wood, and very subtle spices. The aftertaste is funky and earthy and sits right on top of the tongue. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp but extremely dry mouthfeel. After each sip I feel like I need a sip of water. Overall, this is a good beer but it reminds me much more of a sour than a BSDA. The only real negative is the drying quality this beer has on my mouth."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I wasn't sure what to expect with JP's Noel de Calbaza, and was extremely happy to find one of the better and most unique winter seasonals. It's different, and separates itself from the holiday pack immediately. This is one I'll eagerly return to, and hope to find bottles of this under my Christmas tree for years to come."
""
"Overall: This is a really good beer that doesn't quite fit the traditional BSPA label. There are some of the attributes but I am rating more on the quality of the beer. The 2.5 years aging in the bottle must have some effect and if so, it's a nice one. Very much recommended. I need to get another to age."
""
""
""
"Refreshing, and deep a the same time, I am enjoying this beer with gouda, and it's just lovely."
"Great with a salty/sweet cheese or a sweet dessert, i can see this working with a lot of sweeter dishes balancing out the sweetness with it's sour malt flavor."
""
""
""
""
"Your nose isnt deceive you on this one. Its complex, maybe as complex of a Belgian Strong Dark as Ive yet had. Spicy cinnamon and nutmeg. But overall, its a sour beer, but more like Supplication sour. Sour grapes, apple cider vinegar, and barrel can be found upon drinking."
""
""
""
""
"On tap at ChurchKey poured into sampler glass. pours hazy deep red with a huge, rocky off white head. Aroma is sour barrel funk, eraser-like brett character, hints of spice and chocolate. Taste is toffee, caramel, some fruit, smoke, and cinnamon all bathed in a sour oak funk. Body is light, silky, average carbonation, tart spicy finish. A nice Belgian Christmas ale aged in oak barrels."
""
""
"This was the saving grace of an unimpressive visit to the Watershed in Chicago. Pours a strange but alluring color of orange juice cut with mountain dew. Excellently sniffable, with a wide assortment of fruits and spices standing up and saying high. Taste brings a lot of yummy sour apple to the table. Really a good drink, will seek out more of the JP stuff."
"O - This is a really great ale. Jolly Pumpkin never disappoints."
""
"I think there's masterpiece potential to this, but it falls clearly short. Just a couple of heavy-footed emphases where there don't need to be."
""
"Good sour, similar to Bourgogne de Flandres. That said, probably good to pair with food, especially lighter, leafier fare."
""
"Cloudy rusty brown hue. Solid finger of white head. Smells mildly sour, spices and bready malts are present as well. A little bit of that JP funk. Flavor is a nice mix of lactic sour a sweet malt. Modest hints of spices. Very nice. Medium body with mild carbonation. I've always passed this by but not anymore. This stuff is real good."
""
"*also I love the label artwork big time!"
""
""
"O: This is the most interesting offering I've had by this brewery. Definitely different. It's a fizzy, slightly tart version of a Quad. Good, not great. Certainly glad I gave it a pour. If you like Belgian Quads and are also a fan of the ""JP funk", than this will be right up your alley."
""
"Ok third go at this december 2013 on tap at theresas in wayne pa. Much better than I remember. Tart but balanced with the chocolate malt and subtle spice. Really like JP and this brew is pretty spectacular"
""
"Overall, this tastes like a decent, but flawed sour. It tastes ok, but I was hoping for better when I smelled this one."
""
""
"O- Quality Christmas sipper. Much in the mold of the JP signature funk. Not a traditional BSDA by any means, but a quality beer all the same. Nice complexities. Any booze is smooth and subtle. Deceptively drinkable."
"Deep mahogony in body with foamy off-white head that stays. Aroma of Belgian candy sugar, brown sugar, hints of dark fruit zest, some booze. Tastes of rock candy, dark fruit zest, slight brown sugar, some booze, sourness and acidity. Medium bodied with medium carbonation. A wonderful zest-filled brew."
"O: Tasty! I love the oak in this in combination with the sour flavor. A little more spice and this could be my favorite winter ale. Still, not a bad beer to celebrate xmas eve with."
""
""
""
"I would buy a bottle of this stuff from time to time if it were not so damn expensive. I like Jolly Pumpkins sour program/ and their wild yeast strain but it does not keep me coming back for more. It does however, set JP apart from other wild producers."
""
"O- a beer that marries the flavors of sours and Holliday ales perfectly. Loved this one from jp."
"O-this will be a beer I reccomend to people looking for a good holiday brew. It is quite tasty."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall? It's good, but missing the mark a little more than I expect from the great Jolly Pumpkin. But to be fair, that's a high bar to meet."
""
"This appears a nice brown color with a Belgian-y yeasty ester aroma undercut by some oakiness. The oakiness dominates as it warms, with a dry finish. I should say warming finish as well, as the alcohol makes itself known. There’s a lot going on here and I’d like it revisit this beer again to see what else I find."
""
""
"M: Lot's of carbonation. Some alcohol warmth. Pretty light-bodied and dry."
""
""
""
""
"High carbonation carries medicinal/herbal flavors with oaky finish and tart notes. Not very tasty to me."
""
"O: this is any interesting take on a bsda with a definite lactic acid quality. I was kind of hoping for more tartness."
"O - Not a bad beer, not my favorite."
""
""
""
""
"O: Beautiful white grape and cherry notes. Subtle spicing is artfully done and adds to an extra dry finish. Oak and tobacco in the finish is fantastic. Surprisingly mellow for a sour Belgian Dark Strong Ale. Alcohol is not detectable."

"I'm now wishing I grabbed another bomber...*sadface*"
"Actually, after a more few sips, I could easily imagine that I was having a good barrel-aged Chardonnay wine rather than a Belgian ale. This may be the result of its aging and maybe the ongoing fermentation suggested by its active carbonation. In any case I don't find a flavor note that seems distinctively ""beer-like."" That might be a problem for many drinkers, but honestly, after drinking this for a while, I don't much mind. Whatever it is, beer, wine, barleywine, it's darn good."
""
"Overall: A really good beer. Very different then most beers. A sour Dubbel?? Yes. And it works well."
""
""
"overall: Interesting brew. Not a big fan of the sour myself, and not getting the oak."
"750ml bottle. Batch 898, bottled 9-28-11. Served in a Blvd. Tank 7 tulip. Lots of carbonation Poured a hazy brown with a tall, light tan head. Bottle conditioned. Dark malt, cocoa and brett in the aroma. Tart with that trademark JP funk. Some spice. Lighter side of medium bodied. Dry finish. Dark malt in the aroma, doesn't come through as much in the flavor. Very easy drinking for 9%."
"3.5 D: Unique beer. There's some stuff I liked and some that I didn't. In any case, I understand why this costs $13, but I don't think it's worth the price to purchase again. Worth a try though."

"O: This is very easy to drink for a sour beer as it’s not neither too sour nor too tart."

"Noel de Calabaza one of the most sought after Jolly Pumpkin ales with so much character going on in each sip. The color is a pale hazed caramel brown color with an off white tan khaki head forming thick, fine Belgian effervescent style head forming thick this is Batch 903 bottled on 10/3/11. Aroma has tart apples dark brown sugars flowing thick and living thick, hints of oak and spices run through this wild open air fermentation ale. Flavor is nice a thick layer of spices and tart apple make for a fall festive ale/slash ready for snow type of beer warming with alcohol and complexity wrapped into one ale. A bit of horse blanket hints of leather grand complexity that only this beer has to offer, there's no other ale I can think of tasting to compare to this one. Super juicy with fruit and alcohol, spice with hints of dark fruit and layers of smooth alcohol. Overall quality is high unbelieveable super Christmas ale that goes on again and again, flows so nicely."
"Overall, a really nice and funky wild ale. At one year in the bottle, all the yeast critters have really imparted a nice funk throughout and dry finish. Really balanced and easy to drink. I plan on getting this again and sampling it at different ages."
"T: I haven't had as many jp beers as I would like to have had, but this one was definitely sub-par for me. The taste was caramel, chocolate, and honey with a bit of apple cider/cherry tartness. It didn't have quite enough of the tartness or the darker flavors to really stand out for me. Not a bad beer, but not one I'd spend the money for again."
"I split this 750 ml with my brother-in-law, and we had no problems killing the bottle. It went quite quickly actually. We both felt I should have had two of them."
"Pours an amber/brown out of the bottle. Big white head that sticks around. Lacing is nice. Lots of carb on the tongue. Fruit and esters on the tongue. Mouthfeel is definitely peppy with all the carbonation. Overall a nifty beer, though something I'll probably have one of and that's it."
"But it seems like this oddball Noel went to none of the major beer sellers in town. I've only found it in boutique wine shops who have beer selections but don't focus on beer. What to make of this distribution decision, I'm not sure. Still love JP though."
"O- A must try if you enjoy sours or wilds. Definitely strong Flemish characteristics to it. I love the brett but as many have said in regards to JP, they could probably step it back just a botch to allow the beer itself to shine. It was hard to find any ""holiday"" nuances due to the brettiness and extreme carbonation. If the Batch 1, 2009 is in reference to month and year which is most likely, I may have to seek out a fresher bottle to see how it tastes. Flavors all much more pronounced once the beer reaches room temperature. Overall I certainly recommend this beer to the sour lover, but don't go buying any cases of it."
"Tried this one today at Mile High in Lakewood, Colorado. Poured a nice burnished reddish-brown color with a big, creamy tan head. Tart on the nose, with aromas of wood, raisin, brett and berries. On the palate, this one was medium bodied and tart, with more brett and wood, along with flavors of raisins, brown sugar and caramel."
"M - Medium to slightly-more-than-medium carbonation, light on the booziness, not necessarily an overtaxing slow sipper but not one you'd get a whole lot of out of pounding down while drinking with your bro's on Karaoke Night. I'm not hating! This is a good beer, maybe even a great beer, and one of my new favorites from Jolly Pumpkin."
"Overall Impression- Very complexed and does a good job of supporting this style! I would definitely want to have another glass of this but want to have new beers from California that aren't available to me back home. The drinkability on this one was one of the easiest I've ever had, almost Lamic like."
"My Beer Rating: 4.5"
"O- A really solid offering from JP. Was glad to find this on sale for ~$11. I will be looking forward to opening the bottle I have cellaring in a year or so to compare. I recommend getting this is you want a darker flavored tart & musky beer."
"Fuller medium body, a bit higher carbonation, sticky, dry, and lingering on the tongue. Pretty flavorful and interesting, as most of JP's beers are - the alcohol is also masked well and this didn't go overboard with the tartness to where it became offensively sour for the style."
"D-The first beer I've had from Jolly Pumpkin, and it sure won't be the last. I'm very found of the level of sourness of this one."
"Though its a ""winter seasonal"" this beer is not one that necessarily calls for cold weather."
"This brew pours out as a deep color with a tan colored head that had a decent retention to it. The smell of the beer is a mix of sour ale and winter spices. The taste of the beer is t too bad, I expected this one to be really sour but it turned out to have a pretty good balance of spice in there to even things out. This beer isn't typically one I'd pick up around the holiday but it was worth trying."
"smells of sour funk, aromatic spice, gingerbread, and then some more sour but not so much as to over power, just enough to let you know it's a sour. And that is the way it tastes as well. Very nicely balanced between sweet, sour, spicy and not too much of anything in particular. I thought it was a fantastic beer and would get it again, Just what I am looking for these days."
"Pours a hazy brown colour with some hints of orange around the edges. Incredibly huge white head, bottle was slightly gushing upon opening. Some lacing around the glass. Smells of tart cherry, brown sugar and oak with the Belgian yeast. This isn't incredibly sour, but it is on the verge of being a full on sour ale. Nice sweetness as well. Fairly big carbonation level. Another great beer from Jolly Pumpkin."
"jd"
"I don't know if this was a bad bottle, or if this is how it is supposed to taste. It smelled really good, but the taste is nothing like I'd expect for a Belgian Xmas ale. The taste, in fact, really starts to get on my nerves after a while with the whole ""tonic water"" flavor. This was pretty expensive, so I sure hope it doesn't become a drain pour!"
"O: To the dome ..."
"This beer pours a mahogany color with a billowy egg shell white head that recedes slowly leaving sticky lacing. Like Pavlov's dog I salivate to the aroma of this beer...literally. It is of bretta, oak, plums, and a vague spice notes. The taste is sour and tart upfront with a hop kick that is stronger than I had expected. It finishes with with a firm sourness, oak, and some heat. The mouthfeel is full bodied with a high level of fine carbonation, and a velvety texture. Overall, this is a wonderful beer. I can see this beer pairing well with a wide variety of foods. I will certainly drink this again may times."
"HV"
"D: I just realized now writing this sentence that Noel De Calabaza is 9%. I assumed it was around 6% like the other JP offerings. Very well hidden alcohol plus lots of tart brett and dryness means this is a sipper, but one I could sip all the live long day."
"Bottle. 2007 vintage. Poured into a DFH tulip glass a dark reddish brown color with a massive 3 finger head. Notes of spice, cinnamon, and slight funkiness. Medium mouthfeel with lots of carbonation. Sweet upfront with notes of caramel, spice, brown sugar, and some florals. Overall, nothing too great, for an 07, I would have liked to see have more flavors than what it has."
"Overall, this was an interesting take on the style from JP. It was kind of old so it showed a lot of funk. Not really my thing."
"M,D: This stings the palate slightly in start then it opens nicely. This does not drink like a nine percent beer normally does. I enjoyed this it aged nicely."
"Overall: My god, is this is a complex and delicious beer. It brings more to the table than one would expect from a noel. It is not as heavy as other noels; it is very balanced. While there is fruit, a generous amount of layered hops keep it from being sweet. Flavors weave in and out of the beer effortlessly while building on each other. I have now had three of Jolly Pumpkin's beers, and I have been impressed every time. They are producing beer on a high level, and making beer as complex as wine."
"An extraordinarily well-crafted beer. The brewers definitely did their research on what every single spice and fruit would add to its complexity. I was astounded at how many different flavors I was still getting hints of as I continued to surpass the halfway mark of the bottle. Noel De Calabaza is a truly unique holiday brew that stands apart from many of it's competitors."
"D: A sipper for sure, but great to return to as the glass warms to see how the flavors are changing with the temperature. Highly recommended."
"D: I really loved this beer. I am going to have to grab another bottle when I see it."
"D- I like it. I did drink it over an hour so it may be a bit biased in terms of how easy it went, but fairly simple to drink. The alcohol does seem to wander outside the overall presentation occasionally giving me pause, but nothing disappointing outside of that. Just a simple, good beer."
"D- I like this brew. I tend to like most of jp offerings but this one is extra good. The funk doesn't over power the base beer and the blend of flavors hits all the right spots."
"Overall- I have not had this fresh, but this beer has obviously held up excellently. Must find more! Highly recomended."
"D - A very nice Christmas ale. Not as heavy as the norm but I like that. I have the Batch 1 version of this and I'm gonna give it a few more years and then open it up."
"batch 2, bottled 2009 sticker on the back. total gusher. brett beer aged for a little more than a year. what did i expect? mahogany with a huge, tan head that holds and leaves tons of lace. nose is dark fruit, spice, vanilla, oak and fruity, funky bretty goodness as well as hops? hard to believe they stood up this long, but there is definitely an underlying earthy hop character. reminds me of a slightly bigger, slightly brown sugar sweeter aged orval with cherries and vanilla. taste is just what the nose suggested with a big oaky finish and slight pricklyness. relatively easy to drink for such a big, funky beer. out there, but another amazing beer from jolly pumpkin."
"Mmmm - like drinking a funky sour Christmas candy - I could probably put away two to three per session."
"D- this is a great beer from a brewery that not everyone knows about. its also a brewery that not everyone would understand. the fact that they make such complex and unique beers exclusively (well at least in the bottle, ive yet to make it to the brewpub) and charge around $16 a bottle and continue to succeed is hard to believe. keep up the good work, ill continue to buy them whenever i can afford to."
"Drinkability is quite good"
"D/n: One of the most drinkable beers for the complexity. Sour funky beers aren't always the most popular, but this has so many interesting and flavorful characteristics a wide spectrum of preferences would be satisfied. Can't wait for another."
"Rather refreshing and very well crafted. Unique and enjoyable, I would have this one again."
"Cheers!"
"Bottle poured into a Duvel tulip glass. Dark brown with a half inch of foamy head. Smells are sour citrus and yeasts. Taste is a sour mix of lemon and various spices, with emphasis on lemon. Very easy to drink with little alcohol presence. This is out of the ordinary for the style, with more of a saison/wild ale type flavor."
"Grabbed a bottle of this after a promising recommendation. Poured into a tulip with almost no head save for a lot of bubbling almost like a sparkling wine with a thick muddy brown colored body. Smells very fruity, figs and twigs. Tastes very sour almost as if this were an imperial sour brown ale. There is a hint of spice and oak following the sour punch with a apple after taste. All in all this is one mighty drinkable beer. The sourness does not make you cringe and the alcohol is completely hidden."
"I think this beer is miss-categorized and should really be a wild ale rather than a BSDA. I will give it very high marks cause i love the beer, and think its been mis-categorized."
"I thought this was a very drinkable and a nice sour ale. The wild yeast seemed less in control than in some of the other beers, a quality that I very much appreciated."
"A nice dark ale with some sour funk, though not overly sour. This observation from one who is not a big sour fan. Another great beer from Jolly Pumpkin."
"M and D - Thinner than I expected, but not all thin. Silky feel with little carbonation, and a dry finish. The sour makes this a sipper."
"I thoroughly enjoyed this brew on a cold Christmas Eve night while finishing up wrapping gifts for the wife... Need to grab another bottle to age a bit."
"D- This is a sour one, but delicious all the same. If you want mouth puckering, grab this beer."
"D- The alcohol is extraordinarily well hidden. Drinks very nicely on a cold winter night. I absolutely hate to say this, but it is becoming harder for me to distinguish some of the Jolly Pumpkin offerings from one another- not that this is a bad thing. In fact, I take this as meaning I am spoiled."
"Overall this is a nice unique winter seasonal that is drinkable and does warms you up a little bit."
"D: This is fantastic all-around and incorporates wine in a delicious way."
"D: One of not too many strong dark barrel-aged sour ales that are produced domestically, this holiday seasonal from Jolly Pumpkin is surprisingly drinkable for the style. It comes across as fairly standard fare for this brewery--the sourness is mild but easy detected, perhaps slightly less intense than La Roja. There seems to be a slight disconnect between the smell and the appearance--they just don't match. Still, the overall restraint demonstrated makes this an appealing alternative to a similar but more intensely-flavored sour such as Russian River Consecration."
"Mouthfeel is a spritely, crisp, ever-present tickling of carbonation. Very nice acidic finish that is beautifully balanced by the brown sugar, oak and figgy notes."
"This is my first Jolly Pumpkin offering that wasn't a gusher..."
"drinkability: good"
"Medium bodied brew with modest carbonation. Very drinkable for 9% even though the alcohol is not hidden. It displays a dry oaky finish which is somewhat tart."
"Notes: Strange, but stimulating and well worth the try. Glad to see that a few bottles of Jolly Pumpkin made it this time to the area."
"The distictive Jolly Pumpkin house funk is evident, but the brett is well-moderated. Sour cherry and and raw cranberry notes are evident with a slightly lactic bite. Finish is an interesting sweet/dry combination. I can see this going well with poultry."
"D: Pretty meh. I'm not digging this too much. It's very middle of the road. I expect more roast, toast, or sweetness from a Belgian as dark as this, but it's just not there. The booze is not in the least bit overwhelming, however. At any rate, for the price, you're better off seeking out other Jolly Pumpkin beers."
"Drinkability: Fantastically unique. A ""thinking beer"" for sure!"
"D - Very good beer. The ABV is higher but it is a winner."
"2nd beer I've had from Jolly Pumpkin and they continue to impress."
"The mouthfeel is very light for a ""Belgian Strong Dark Ale"" but I think we know this doesn't fit into any one style very neatly. This is dangerously drinkable."
"Appearance as mentioned on the label; mahogany, high carbonation beer with a beige thick head. We had to wait a while for the beer to settle. The first nose was full of spices, but these aromas faded away before the first sip to let place for some funk, raisins and sour cherry. This beer is very long in the mouth, the flavours are persistent,and it has vinous taste and some tartness, A little touch of oak complement this wonderful brew."
"Bottled 10-6-2010. Pours a reddish brown with small white head. Scent is kinda fruity with a slight sourness to it...which I wasn't expecting. A few funky notes as well with very light chocolate. This beer is like no other beer I've ever tasted before...it's like a sour Belgian Strong Dark Ale. I was expecting something that tasted like heavy malt, dark fruits, chocolate, and spices. I get some of those flavors...I get light malt, immediately followed by delicious tart cherry flavors with oak. Then I get some spiciness and cocoa flavors. Ends with a nice cherry flavor with lingering roastiness and tartness. Delicious and interesting beer. Mouthfeel is lighter than expected, with a nice crisp and light puckering finish. Drinkability is high, as the alcohol is hidden fairly well."
"I always say that the Jolly Pumpkin beers are very similar to each other. However they are all amazing."
"I hope I have the willpower to cellar at least one of these till next year."
"I think a little more time would do this brew some good."
"Poured into a tulip glass. Color is dark brown with an off-white head. The nose is some cherries, dark fruits, oak, funk, and a bit of sourness. The taste brings the oak and cherry components through pretty well. Good feel with nice sour and oak character. Drinks quite well and is another solid beer from Jolly Pumpkin."
"D- Lighter bodied and nice crisp carbonation. This really doesn't fit the style, reminds me more of a wild ale. The scores would be better if it were that category. With that in mind this is a good beer. Don't let the style fool you, if you like wild ales. this is a good one."
"Aged for two years in my cellar. Reddish brown but clear. A great billowy head that hangs around for a long time and leaves excellent lacing. It just smells tart, right up front you know what you're getting into. Minor funk in the nose, not as much complexity as I would like but it's still damn good. Bitter and tart, a very complex array of flavors. Apple cider, some oakiness, just a very well balanced and complex beer, nothing really sticks out. For a beer this big, the body is a little thin but considering how long I've held onto this one it's not all that surprising. Overall, just another great beer from Jolly Pumpkin that I'll visit again the next time I'm in the midwest."
"still with the coin jolly pumpkin mineral sour quality. this was strangely similar had after the fantome noel. the look was a bit lighter in color and murkier though. coffee press but on the side of a medium brown tone. a rather small head but a distinct tart in the nose that doesn't over power an proved to be delicious with thai food. palate of lemongrass, bitter orange peel, and some burnt clove. the mineral notes has a chalky quality but combined with malt nicely. giving it a pear, apple, the tart mild sweet of a fresh pineapple with the lingering of grass. there was some candy notes of fruit but they were secondary to the mineral tart quality. there was also a chocolate mild quality but as if a split between the sweet and the bitter sour astringent of bakers' cocoa. the thai food beer. and great with duck and more pungent spices."
"Really more of a Kriek with dark cherries, but very much a Belgian Strong Ale. Again, don't thing of this as something like Chimay or Maudite, but more of an excellent example of what Jolly Pumpkin does best. They funkify some really strange styles, and sometimes they don't work. Though this is one that I think works like a charm. Well done, and highly recommended."
"D: it actually drank pretty good but IMO it had way too much carbonation to fully enjoy this beer. I've had this brew a couple times before and this is the first time it was over carbonated."
"2007 bottle, blend 5. Pours dark brown with fiery orange edges. Aroma bursts forth, first a dry oaky sourness, then a montage of tropical fruits, especially coconut, sour apples. Flavor has an initial burst of tartness, pretty much typical JP oak and dryness, then of course nice layers of fruit underneath. Coconut and almond shine through very pleasantly. A slight vinegar-infused apple is present. There's more tropical fruits I can't quite put down. Kind of spicy in the finish. This has some wonderful elements, especially the almonds and coconut juice. Some of the tartness at the finish is not as refined as I would like. Overall, pretty awesome."
"D-tasty and balanced, nice moderate acidity with sweet ripe fruits and a nice earthy funk ."
"Drinkability: This is a wonderful beer, great nose and palate. I'll be picking this up again come next Winter."
"D= Decent brew but I'm happy I only got one. The carbonation on this one is a little much for me and the spice sour mix is odd... Not a bad brew but not for me."
"O: good tartness, don't like the spice as much, good, complex, more fruit and less roast and spice would be nice"
"D: Jolly Pumpkin's beers rarely blow me away, but they're always enjoyable. This is another one to add to that list; I just wish it were more affordable."
"It's a Belgian-styled wonder of a Christmas ale. Exquisite and highly recommended."
"D - Nice but would tire pretty quick."
"Still not very impressed by Jolly Pumpkin. Just seems like the beers lack depth. It's just a good sour taste."
"This release from Jolly Pumpkin is a bit weird for me. On one hand, I like the flavor and what it brings to the table. On the other hand, it's so overcarbonated that it's annoying and tough to even get into a glass. Carbonation is the one huge glaring problem that needs to be addressed. I believe its scores would improve all-around once that's corrected. There's definitely something here, it just needs a little bit of work."
"D: It is definitely drinkable, but so are most Belgian strong dark ales..."
"Overall, a good beer with some serious carb issues that ultimately detract from the beer and made finishing it a real chore. I liked the flavor enough to drink it all but the carb was painful - literally felt like a balloon filling up. Wish I could say this was isolated but have had several JP's with carb issues. Mild recommend. Rotation - not avail here in TX so ummagum shipped me one - many thanks! If here, I'd be good with just this one - maybe a 2nd try if I knew that batch wasn't over-carbonated. [SB]"
"Smells kind of like an oud bruin initially. Spice and yeasty esters create a more cherry-tart component in the nose than in the taste which is kind of interesting. The taste has a big maltiness with a very subtle (compared to the aroma) fruity tartness. Really interesting, but I can't say I'm digging it too much. Kind of spicy and tangy with some orange peel and merlot. Medium bodied and medium carbonation, very interesting to drink and challenging to describe. Went down easy for 9%, but I can't say I would want to drink a whole bottle of this."
"One of the best sour ales I've ever had. Really great stuff."
"D: Really enjoyable despite possible discrepancies. Nice dark fruit and funk as usual and another good offering by JP. Although the $ is a little high to get these often, I'm rarely if ever let down."
"Will definitely pick another bottle up if I spot one."
"Cheers"
"Overall - Disappointingly, the flavors are not very strong nor do they come together in a very interesting way."
"D)	This was a very easy beer to consume and was so delicious I purchased a couple more."
"Beer is sour but the overall flavor is a little watery and weak. I'm not impressed. There is a slight after taste. Drinkability is fine and mouthfeel is OK, overall the beer wasn't anything special, just OK."
"10 minutes after pouring 2/3 of a pint glass there was still 3"" of head in the bottle. So, becareful where and when you open this but once it settles down, a good beer."
"They hide the abv very well here. Great job."
"D- It's gonna take some work getting the 1 pt 9 oz down as it tastes like wine and drinks like pop"
"Drinkability is pretty good. Overall this is an excellent beer, one I would definitely have again, despite being the hardcore ticker that I am."
"A very different beer from what I was used to. However a nice spice with some coriander (go to the kitchen and find your wife's spice rack) thrown in there. I wish they came in 12 oz bottles and not just 25's because it can be a lot of beer in one bottle."
"light, airy, and even (as previously mentioned) watery mouthfeel. Not as carbonated or sour as it could be. drinkability is fine because I will finish the bottle, but I wont be picking this one up again anytime soon."
"A truly unique ale that brings not only characteristics typical of the sour and farmhouse ale - but that also blends these characteristics with the darker Belgian ale to its compliment."
"The nose and the taste just don't match up for me, left me a little unsatisfied. No doubt still a tasty brew by any standards but not in the highest tier for me. Thanks for bringing this Derek!"
"Bottle: Blend 1, 2009. Full fluffy white head, very effervescent. Aromas of caramel, toast, brett sourness. Deep amber color with a lingering rocky white head that laces on the glass as you drink it. Dark sour fruit layered with spices and a bit of oak. Long finish. An excellent holiday sipper."
"Drinkability: Couldn't handle a steady diet of it, but I really love the tart flavors and the great puckering mouthfeel; ABV would be a bit high for too much as well, but to work through 22 oz. on occasion wouldn't pose too much of a problem."
"Belgian dark ale is a horrible way to catagorize this beer. It's not even in the same ballpark as a a Chimay or Westy. What it is is a Wild ale and given that it's not to bad. I'm not a huge fan the style, but this beer is right in there and pretty damn good.."
"D- This was a very surprising beer that turned out to be a tasty treat dispite the nose and the gushing forth from the bottle. I think Jolly Pumpkin does a good beer and this proves it once again."
"Very glad the beer lady at Whole Foods pointed me in this direction. I am going to drop by and buy a couple more bottles tonight."
"Blend 2, 2009. Pours dark brown with a large beige head. There is some sourness in the aroma. Some tart citrus and some caramel malt. The flavor has some tartness and a little bit of funk. Medium body and very drinkable."
"750ml bottle poured into a tasting snifter and shared amongst four. Batch 1, 2009. Poured the color of unpasteurized cider, with a murky clarity. Head was half of an inch and off-white and quickly dispersed into a swirl and a band. Nose was tart and slightly vinous. Flavors consisted of tart cherries, vinous dark fruit and a hint of wood, with a light, salty quality that lingers on the lips. Mouthfeel was light-medium and extremely gassy/effervescent and slightly prickly. An interesting sour belgian strong dark; but the carbonation is way too aggressive."
"Overall Impression: Very nice. Quite possible too much of a sour bite. Very refreshing."
"D - Not really what I was expecting and also didn't love it. The mouthfeel alone put me off a bit."
"This beer is difficult to evaluate overall and I found myself at half glass not quite knowing what else to say about it. Certainly unique, it's a pleasant and enticing brew, another Jolly Pumpkin Ale that in my mind defines the word ""artisan"" in terms of fine beer. Recommended of course!"
"I certainly didn't enjoy this batch (#333/334) as much as I remember loving a previous sample I had when the beer was first released (in 2007, Batch #4). My notes would indicate this bottle had much more carbonation and much less flavour. Still, I did rather enjoy both (albeit to different degrees) just like I've enjoyed every JP beer I've ever had."
"Drinkability: If I knew where to get more of this I'd consider grabbing a couple more. This might be my favorite beer of 2009... so so so good."
"Brettanomyces are a thing of beauty. Often frowned upon by the average beer drinker for its extreme sour characteristics, when understood and appreciated it really is a work of art. With that said obviously this ale will be very sour. But to those that read this who are writing it off immediately because of that don't worry, subtle notes of chocolate, dried dark fruit and cranberry come into play once the first sip goes down. This beer has a very generous head thanks to re-fermentation, that lingered around to the very last sip. Its overall flavor is reminiscent of sour apples soak in a Belgian strong dark ale, a truly joyous winter treat that I will highly recommend to others."
"Notes: This is my second Jolly Pumpkin beer. I like this one also, even though I would say La Roja was a little better. This one has all the right elements. I can even tell that they are there in the taste and smell, but for some reason it just doesn't pop. It's being held back from releasing all its complexities some how. However as the score shows, it was still delicous."
"Poured a darkish ruby brown with a big soapy head that took forever to dissipate on top of an toffee, bready malt aroma mixed with cherries/dark fruit, spicy yeast and a hint of clove. Smooth and spicy and definitely a beer to let warm as it perks up a little as you sip on it; the sweetness is like caramel and sweet fruit and is up front and then comes a sour, sharp burst for balance like citric (orange) and spice for a nice finish. A good winter warmer."
"Jolly Pumpkin Noel de Calabaza pours a couple of stiff fingers of foam over an opaque cola-colored brew. Carbonation on mine (an '07) is very spritzy- in fact it gushed a bit when I got the cap off. The nose is typical Jolly Pumpkin tart funk, but also dark sweet fruit. Flavor is fruity up front- apple cider and dark figs predominate- maybe a bit of clove and wood, with a little tartness off the back, and herbal hops. Mouthfeel is round, but lighter than one would think because of the carbonation, and finishes dry-ish- there's a little oak in the aftertaste too. This is a 9% ABV ale, though that only makes itself felt with some heat in the belly- ideally, you're drinking this one slowly with friends- and you should. Fragrant belches!"
"I was told to get this by a bartender at Eulogy in Philadelphia (who by the way thinks he knows more about beer than he actually does--typical want-a-be beer expert). That being said, I gave it a try despite this guy's so-called ""knowledge"" of beer. If you want to enjoy a true Belgian winter beer, forget Michigan and stick to Belgium...skip this one because it is certainly not worth the $12 per bottle."
"D- Goes down pretty easily but I don't think I will be able to drink the whole bottle."
"D- While the alcohol is well hidden, and while this beer tastes so wonderfully complex, I can see my palate getting quickly fatigued with multiple glasses of this beer... hence a half-mark above average in the 'drinkability' department."
"J"
"Flavor consists of citrus, Brett, sour cherries, similar to a Belgian Strong Pale Ale(by taste). Very good...and a great winter warmer."
"D: Great. I was surprised to see this wasn't a sour or wild ale though. This is tart, but not overwhelming. 9%? I hardly noticed."
"D:  Yes!  Hook it to my veins!  Maybe my favorite American tart/sour beer."
"Drinkability is good. A great beer, one I look forward to every year and one that always delivers!"
"A really nice interpretation of what I would call an American Winter Ale, bit could also pass easily a s Belgian Quad. Kind of on the darkish red side as it pours but a nice rich head. A bit tart initially on the mouth but finishes very smooth with subtle hints of cocoa, dried cherries and other fruits, and a oaked maltiness in the aftertaste. Very easy to drink, goes down rather smoothly without much fighting needed. Much better than the typical Belgian Quad. Has a lingering taste of woodiness combined with the dried fruits which perfectly balances out the flavor. Would be anxious to try this on tap."
"taste is tart, sour malt, some caramel, spice, and some cocoa, ends somewhat dry and tart."
"D: You have to find this and try it. Share it with friends - appropriate for this time of year. I'm going to get bottles for my better beer drinking friends and more than a few more for me!"
"This beer is like a La Roja with more malt and spice flavors. I am enjoying this easy drinking sour. I would seek this on draft if available(ya right). As far as going to the store and getting another before they sell out(which I was planning to do), I thought the price point was to high on this one. A very good balanced sour."
"D: A nice sipper that is great to share."
"A nice sipper. Funkiness is not too off-putting. Essence of dark fruit is sophisticated and delicate with sour elements highlighting rather than overwhelming the fruit."
"Blend 5, 2007"
"This was a pleasure to drink and the alcohol didn't show itself in the taste but it sure did show itself in other ways."
"[edit] Just had a 2009 tonight. It was definitely much more ""hot"" in the sense you could taste the alcohol and the flavors were not as precise. IMO you NEED to let this beer sit for a while because the 2008 after a year was amazing. I have two more 2009's and will re-review them in a year and see how they compare to the 2008. Still a very enjoyable brew, but you can tell it became more tame over the year it aged."
"This is a very complex unique beer. Think christmas beer/ sour hybrid."
"Solid beer from JP."
"Absolutely easy drinking and very enjoyable. Fantastic brew."
"Drinkability: A true multitude of complexities within this one, and, as always, it's another weird, wild ride from Jolly Pumpkin."
"T - This has to be one of my favorite Christmas beers, very favorable and memorable, another winner from the folks at Jolly Pumpkin"
"A really interesting, and fairly complex ale. Superb!!! Absolutely worth seeking out!!!"
"Pours deep brown with off-tan head. Nose is reminiscent of Duchesse du Bourgogne - some sour passion fruit and brothy aromas. Palate is pleasantly sour with passion fruits again. Tart on the finish. Easy drinking. Somewhat low carbonation. Like a Duchesse light."
"This is a fairly typical JP take on a Belgian style and, while I can appreciate the funky twist, I probably would have liked the underlying beer on it's own merits. Still, very tasty."
"Overall, an interesting beer, and different from any other JP I've had. Pick one up."
"Overall this a tasty, funky, fully enjoyable brew."
"D - Yet another good beer from Jolly Pumpkin they have yet to disappoint me although this one isn't as sour as their other beers its still a damn fine brew worth getting sometime"
"Overall I wasn't as impressed as I was hoping to be but it was still good. It's really not that complex, but that's OK."
"Drinkability: this one was a drank slowly over a cold evening and one bottle was nice to share. I would not have more than 2 or 3 glasses but the overall beer is tasty."
"Tried 2009 Batch 4. Still the massive head, but this time the carbonation was near perfect. Upping the score accordingly for mouthfeel. Could use a bit more tartness and funk."
"Another solid offering from Jolly Pumpkin. Playful, intense, and complex. If I liked anise or licorice, I might score the taste higher."
"Drinkability: Overall, this was a nicely done Strong Dark Ale. Sometimes I think this beer relied too much on the oak, but again that's a very minor problem. The one big problem I saw was the hefty price tag this beer had on it. Compared to some of their other beers (price and taste), I would more than likely go after one of those instead of this beer. If you want a nice expensive winter time beer, then you should think about this Jolly Pumpkin beer."
"This is another one for the lover of Brett. While I do enjoy these from time to time, this one didn't rock my world and I had a slightly hard time getting through the whole thing. I enjoyed the flavors, but I felt like this bottle may have been a little off. This is on the try again list."
"D - For a wood aged, sour beer this is pretty drinkable. The flavors do not overwhelm and the sourness is restrained and this, combined with a just slightly sweet finish makes for surprisingly good drinkability. The aroma is among the best I have had in a JP beer, but I was a bit disappointed in the flavor at first. Towards the end of the glass, more of the barrel character began to come out and the beer displayed an overall complexity that is more than the sum of its parts. A very nice beer, overall and one I would buy again, though I doubt I'll have the chance."
"O- This beer was not at all I expected, neither from the style, nor name, nor description. In the end it was very similar to Bam Noire, which I really enjoyed. But I can't say it was very malty, nor all that dark. I did enjoy it though."
"The body is closer to moderate. A light carbonation, that could be more for style. Some warming the alcohol is hidden well. Overall there are some nice notes with esters and spice but the malt is limited. I think as it ages the funk will come out more. Overall not bad."
"drinkability is good. good balance with the funk and everything else. great barrel character that doesn't overpower. excellent depth that just keeps you going back for more. when the bottle was gone we immediately started discussing opening another - a testament to how good and drinkable it is. another winner from jolly pumpkin."
"I really don't want to finish this, but at the price I will - it isn't so bad I have to pour it out, it just is not my cup of tea. or, stein of brew as it were."
"Notes: I am glad that I tried this beer which is in one of my favorite styles but I was dissapointed to taste that punch of overripe oranges near the beginning that stuck around into the aftertaste. A good example of Belgian Strong Dark Ale but not my favorite."
"Pours a blackish mahogany with a silky tan head. The nose has sweet malts, oak, spices, chocolate, dark fruits and a bit of barnyard funk. The taste is equally complex with rich bready malts, candy, cocao, figs, cherries, christmas spices and a subtle yet very well balanced oaky manure presence. Creamy body is well carbonated. A unique Belgian style strong ale from JP. One of their better ales in my book."
"This is a very good beer, and quite a unique one. I believe I bought this bottle at Discount Liquor in Milwaukee."
"D - Despite the thinness of the mouthfeel, this one hell of a beer. The flavors are balanced perfectly and it is not overly sour, but you certainly know the bret is there. Definitely recommend it to anyone who likes sours."
"The mouthfeel is nicely carbonated but doesn't have the thickness or creaminess of Belgian types. It is a nice drinker if you like the sourness, goes well alone or with sweetish savory foods like good barbecue. Should keep well for year round use. Another winner from Ron and co."
"drinkability is great. this is a mildly sour brew with a great balance and tasty fruit notes. an easy-going sour beer with a wonderful composition and a very drinkable profile. cheers!"
"Overall this is a very complex beer with a flavor profile that is hard to pick out. There is so much going on in this one it will keep you guessing for a while. The malt profile mixed with a beer profile that would normally be quite yellow/golden in appearance. A brew defenitely worth picking up and trying for yourself. A fun one, and a very good beer."
"Bathc 333/334. Bottle from kkulacki, and probably my last JP for a long while. Thanks, konrad! Pours a very dark ruby/crimson color. Super pillowy absorba-foam type head. Flavor has a nice muted sourness throughout on a creamy chocolate malt backbone. Fruity, but also dry, with roasted malt and grassy hops. Sourness grows and expands. nice lactic note on the finish as well as a warm alcohol sensation. I also get a hint of allspice and clove. Creamy mouthfeel...medium to full bodied for the style, i'd say. Drinks fantastically, especially on a sort-of-cold california night. another winner from Jolly Pumpkin."
"Drinkability: My first Jolly Pumpkin, and one I'm glad to have tried - quite the experience. I'm slowly growing more accustomed to bretted brews, and this one is definitely mild - the tartness and sour notes are heavily fruity and blended well with everything else. That aside, the alcohol is not unreasonably high for the style nor apparent. Just a pleasant, enjoyable beer."
"Not to mention great, great artwork, Mahalo to Laurie Jeffries who was so friendly when I came in to buy her families awesome beer. I love the Black Beard flag."
"D: Good drinkability, warming with a nice roasted feel and dry booziness. Deliciously malty and a nice Belgian winter sipper."
"D- Very interesting brew here. Easy to drink and could do this one again."
"D: Another tasty treat from JP."
"Overall, Noel De Calabaza is one of my favorite beers from Jolly Pumpkin. Highly Recommended!"
"D: The 9% is hidden very well and the beer just drinks easy. It took me at least and hour to finish the 750 only because you want to slow down and savor it."
"d - i wouildn't want to drink it every night, but for the holidays these oak aged beers are a real gift."
"Pours a cloudy brown with some floaties and a creamy off-white head. Spotty lacing. Expected sweet and sour combo that is Jolly Pumpkin. Caramel, chocolate malt, funky yeast, and dried fruits mixed with red wine, oak, apples, and vinegar. It leans towards the ""Belgian Stout"" in several areas, including the initial taste. A strong caramel/chocolate combo up front with an equally strong fruity sweetness that borders on syrupy. As the beer warms and you progress through it, it takes on more of the oaky, vinuous qualities I was hoping for. A little sour, either from the barrel or the yeast, or both, but I enjoyed how it gave the brew a pop in the finish."
"Pours a beautiful deep brown color with a relentless tan head that sticks around most of the glass. Nose of straight Jolly Pumpkin funk, which i have grown to love, lots of lemon zest, wet wood from the oak and a hint of wintery spice. Good flavor here, lots of sourness and funk, roasted malt sweetness is mainly an after thought if you ask me, this one is pure funk driven right now. Medium bodied, silky smooth and crazy drinkable for a 9%er. Great beer."
"Notes: My boo bought me this for Christmas. She's a keeper."
"Not real drinkable, the vinegar elements put me off."
"Mouthfeel is light bodied and smooth."
"Overall: I was really excited for this beer but when I opened and poured my first glass I was a little turned off by lack of its scent. It also took a few sips to get into... The more I had the more I began noticing its complexity. It's not my favorite style but I can say that it's probably the best I've had of its kind. If I had more money I would probably buy a few more bottles. I'm definitely going to purchase more Jolly Pumpkin products. I recommend this beer."
"The bottle indicates batch 333 of 334. It poured DEEP mhabogany amber, nearly cola colored, with tons of sticky tan head, settling after about five minutes. Sweet fruit aromas dominate before warming. Subtle chocolate and alcoholic notes soon appear. Fruityness dominates the taste, with a slightly syrupy palate, some caramel and chocolate do appear. Quid delicious! Cheers and Merry Christmas!"
"Christmas, New years, Fourth of July, I don't care. This is one damn good beer. Aroma of sweet fruit, bourbon. Dark amber with a big foamy head. Flavor is very complex. Vanilla, fruit, wood, bourbon. Very dry finish. A bit sour. Very drinkable considering the alcohol content. Be careful."
"Very drinkable - sourish, but with a sweet and bitter balance. Alcohol is very well-hidden in taste. I could easily drink too much of this! I love it!"
"Overall I at first thought this was a tart dubbel, but after I tasted it a bit more it has a lot of Oud Bruin characteristics. Very solid to say the least and definitely worth a shot."
"Big fluffy off white head just kept growing after pouring from a big bottle. The fruity sweet aroma fills the room while waiting for the head to dissipate a bit. Another different but delicious brew from Jolly Pumpkin. A funky off kilter taste of dark dried fruit. The body is medium with a bit of carbonation. The Oak barrel flavor seems to turn up as a bit of sourness rather than the typical bourbon alcohol flavor. In fact it is hard to detect any alcohol at all. But at the same rate it is a great winter beer."
"D - Did i mention i nearly finished half the bottle as i wrote this review? Wow... extremely drinkable. Flavors are very controlled in this brew, very, very well balanced even for such unique flavors. For such a great beer, its easy to savor and even easier to put back. Glad i splurged on this Holiday beer buy!"
"This one pours with a nice, sandy/tan colored head that rises to about a two-finger height. Deep dark brown coloration gives it an ominous appearance at first, but holding it up to the light reveals gorgeous tinges of burgundy and ruby. Scent is highly appealing; offers generous hints of sourness, spices and festive fruitiness. Tasting reveals sourness reminiscent of tart cherries, as well as a very satisfying malty sweetness. The label professes the presence of ""layered hops"" but I am struggling to detect their influence on this brew. Upon close scrutiny, there is a slight hop flavor, but this is certainly dominated by the fruity sourness and spices mentioned earlier. This one has a nice mouthfeel that's not too rich, yet not too thin. It hits the mark very well. Not a beer that I could see myself drinking tons of in one sitting, but definitely one that I will come back to (given the chance)."
"The yeast added a richness to mouthfeel which I felt detracted from the sourness. Lacing on both glasses was nice."
"""Blend 4, 2007"""
"D: Quite nice, and nicer with age I'd bet. This one is an easy sipper and definitely one that I'd have again."
"Enjoyed a bottle of this at City Beer Store with abraser. Dark brown/reddish in color with pretty good carbonation. Smell is tart, dark fruit, and spicy. Taste is more of the same - not crazy sour, very well balanced with tart apples, muted cider vinager, sweet, spices. Mouthfeel is medium with pretty significant carbonation. Highly drinkable Christmas ale."
"The best JP I've had. Excellent and unique. Would glad drink this consistently if I could."
"D. Oh heavens yes. Flavorful and delicate. Sip or Drink Heartily. A good vintage and glad I held out this long.."
"Overall a pretty solid beer. Nothing outstanding, but nothing to complain about."
"Wonderful version of oaking, aged an extra year in my cellar. Reddish colour, Belgian Flemish sour aroma. Medium plus mouthfeel. Delicious,cherry-ish, good integration of oak in flavour. Very drinkable, smooth and satisfying.Carbonation appropriate, brings out the bold flavour."
"Bottle: Poured a deep reddish/brown color ale with a large foamy head with great retention and great lacing. Aroma of oak with some tart notes and maybe light cherry notes as well though that may originate from the oak. Taste is very complex and is dominated by some oak notes with some tart and sour notes also easily detectable. Full body with great carbonation and no trace of alcohol could be detected. This beer was very well done by one of the best US brewer of sour beers."
"Drinks alright, a bit too tart & dry for my tastes, sour beer freaks will probably disagree. Alright for what it is, not one I'll be seeking out"
"Pours a cloudy berry caramel colored amber with a huge stiff foamy light tan head that decomposes slowly leaving sheets of lacing behind. The aroma has an aggressive earthy fruity strawberry and cherry sourness. Visibly effervescent, the mouth feel is light and tingly. The flavor is mild and tart. There is a nice cherry presence over a vinegar character; not sure if that is the oak barrel treatment or not. Tangy yet finishes clean and dry. A lot to consider...I'm down to the last few ounces ...not the easiest drinker (unless you're big into these tart beverages), but worthy of your consideration. Appreciate this one from autumnaldave."
"D - It's always a challenge, and a pleasure, to review a Jolly Pumpkin beer. While drinking the first glass, I thought this was going to be a slog, as the sour and spices weren't quite doing it for me. Yet, sip by sip, this one wins your admiration. I think Jolly Pumpkin is the Radiohead of beer - seems complicated and obtuse at first, but as you give it a chance, it locks in."
"These guys have some of the coolest looking labels in the business. The one for Noel de Calabaza (Christmas Pumpkin) is no exception. Too bad the contents of the bottle aren't as spectacular. All things considered, I might be willing to give this one another try."
"A great sour on steroids. I just prefer a bit more acid and less sourness."
"Notes: Received from wolfsblood - thanks! Awesome stuff."
"Poured into a Rapscallion glass, formed a 1"" beige head over the cloudy reddish amber brew. Head stays longer than a mooching relative, with thick merignuey lace. Aroma is tart and fruity. Taste starts with a peek of malt, then tartness takes over, with a wisp of alcohol at the end. Mouthfeel is a bit rocky being so tart, and drinkability cramped a bit as well. COuld maybe do with a touch more sweetness, and the style category here could be more towards a sour or lambic-influence. Interesting, nonetheless."
"Overall a very nice beer I'll be looking to age."
"D: The ale is decent, but the flavors never really came together for me. I'd rather have one of JP's plain old wild ales."
"Pours a nice dark golden brown color, very nice carbonation, very nice one-finger plus creamy off-white head, which leaves some nice thick creamy sticky lacing behind. The nose is malty, with some bourbon, figs, raisins, plums, slight yeast, and oak. The taste is very slightly sweet, very nice touch of sourness, malty, with some yeast notes, dark fruits, with a nice tone of oak/bourbon. Full-medium body, the alcohol is hidden very well. Very drinkable, this is another very tasty brew from JP, one of the best from them in my book, highly recommended."
"This beer is decent, but IMO is a bit simplistic on the nose and palate. Granted, I'm not a huge fan of sour beers, but I don't mind them if the sour is countered with some other flavors as well. In this beer it really isn't; sour is almost all I get out of it. Oh well..."
"Great BSDA that has the depth and complexity I look for in my American versions. Jolly Pumpkin has yet to disappoint me."
"I liked it and would consider it in the future. If you like to try beers pushing the lines of styles and taste this is a must try."
"Drinkability: This is more quaffable than a 9% beer as tart as this one is should ever be."
"Enjoyed it very much."
"Wow! Where did I score this?!? Fantastiche! The nose was musty, brett-laden, and simply wild. There was a thin, light brown head, but it quickly reduced to wisps. The color was a deep brown with ruby highlights. Mouthfeel was thick and efferevscent with just a touch of the characteristic J. P. sourness. There was a bite on the tongue, but nowhere as overpowering as some of the Pumpkin's offerings. The finish lingered with a great bite, but again, not so intense as to put off the uninitiated. It may have been my aging (dated 2, 2007), but I would serve this to guests without hesitation."
"Drinkability is ok/good, but with the ABV and the sweet/sour, I wouldn't want to drink a whole bottle at once."
"It is as drinkable as the style can be. I had a couple dud beers recently but this restores my faith... okay, my faith was never shaken. JP is a great brewery and this is a great beer. I enjoyed every sip, thanks Chris and thank you Jen."
"Near black and a large beige head with excellent retention. Mellow fruity nose of cherry, melon, and citrus ester. Starts off fruity and vinous with the oak character and towards the end becomes bitter and very dry with a burnt malt character. Tart fruit, plum, charred oak, a little medicinal cough syrup astringent in the back, and some malt tones that are earthy, organic. Lots of carbonation is a bit over the top. Improves as it warms but too late for a high recommendation."
"New discovery: I like sour beers!"
"D: I could probably not drink more than one, but it is a great great beer. More than one in a night, no. One every night I have the chance, yes."
"Overall impression: Another well done sour beer - its hard to pick out the details of these, but I certainly enjoy them."
"Not sure what was intended here, but I sure did not get what I expected."
"Rich dark caramel color with glowing orange edges. Tart cherryish malty aromas to it. Very dry and tart cherry and brettyness to it. Slight funkiness in the taste and the flavor is rather mild. Unique, but quite nice and drinkable. Grew on me as I had more, and the oaky-ness of it was strong and more enjoyable after the first sample. Nice beer"
"One of the better Christmas beers I tasted from this past year, only second beer tasted from Jolly Pumpkin and both have been pretty good, will drink again next year when it is released, recommended during next winter because it will most likely taste much better fresh even though it is bottle conditioned"
"Still can't get over this ""dirty sock"" kind of skunky smell. Will let the other bottles sit for awhile and see where this one goes."
"Pours cloudy dark red and brown with an insanely huge tan head. Like most of the Jolly Pumpkin beers, smells strongly of sour wood, yeast, perhaps a little dust. The christmas spicing comes through in the flavor. Tastes like a Flemish sour red ale with a dollop of orange peel, pepper, and anise layered on top. Alcohol not at all obvious apart from some spicy fruitiness. The body is airy and light, alive with a bit too much carbonation. A winner from Jolly Pumpkin. The bottle goes quickly due to the sour quenching character."
"Dark tawny colour with a fluffy beige cap. Chunky, sticky lace and good head retention. A little hazy. Funky aroma - lemon zest, earthy and acidic with a light vinegar character. Great flavour. There's a tartness that formed a solid backbone, with a bit of brown sugar. Earthy and fruity, notes of sour cherry and plum, light woody oak, with a hint of leather and tobacco in the finish. Medium bodied with ample carbonation that didn't overwhelm. Nice texture with a bit of puckering tartness. Sugary, yet dried the palate in the finish. Light alcohol warmth. Great stuff from JP, just as I've come to expect. I hope they pull this one out again next year in time for Xmas."
"Overall: Smooth. Very pleasurable and balanced, yet memorable. Nothing overly aggressive. A winner."
"This beer is dark brown, and cloudy, pours with a small but dense and persistent head, which leaves lace all the way down the glass. Aroma is slight, but with wonderful sour notes, and a pretty good amount of brett funk on the nose. Perhaps some pediococcus and lactobacillus as well. The Belgian funk comes through in the flavor as well, with notes of dark cherries, more Brett funk, and tart apples, backed by a nice malt backbone, and the barest hints of oak and hop. Finishes dry and tart, but not overwhelming."
"I missed the $7 sale on this and wound up paying $20 for 2. I can't wait to try other beers from this brewery. Highly recommended. Go do yourself a favor and buy this. If you enjoy sour beers, you'll love this. Even if you don't, it's a great into into!"
"Taste is just full of amazing brett flavour. Sourness is offset by just a touch of rich vanilla and a hint of chocolate, especially in the aftertaste. Big Biscuity malt in the background, but it's nearly obscured by everything else going on. Plums and raisins are here as well, and some herbs. This beer just keeps developing as you keep drinking it, it's pretty amazing, tons of dimension and flavour. Carbonation isn't too obnoxious in the mouth. Dries the palate out almost completely with sourness, just makes you want to keep drinking. This is a really impressive beer, so drinkable, but at 9% I'm afraid 750ml all to myself is both a blessing and a curse though!"
"Insanely drinkable, particularly for this alcohol percentage. Really really REALLY need to drink this close to room temperature (where I had it), as there's a ton of very, very subtle complexity here you could lose. I'd say set it down for a few months to a year to see if the bourbon blends in more smoothly. But fine to drink right now."
"Full but never thick with a nice, tingling carbonation and a dry finish. It's complex to be sure and is certainly a sipper. Still, it never encroaches upon palate-busting territory and is quite a treat."
"Overall this was an interesting, if not intriguing selection. The style was nearly impossible to nail down so I just left that as it was. The flavor was very nicely balanced and quite different which is always a plus, I just really wish it had a little more carbonation. That really would have turned this from a good beer to an excellent one. Maybe it was a bad bottle, I have another to compare so we shall see. Still would have to say that this was a good call and worthy of a try."
"D: Excellent drinkability. The alcohol seems pretty transparent in the nose and taste but I started to feel it by the end of the bottle."
"A hazey and ruddy medium borwn ad garnet hue with dark orange highlights when held to the light. You can see some bubbles through this dark haze. The head is less than par. The aroma is a tart fruits. Very tannic smelling, cherries and figs. The taste i a mild, to light bodied fruity alt. Very light vvingar mixed with cherries, light colored crranst, tart prunes, and dates. Very tart for a dark Belgian ale. The body is light to mild with a sharp tart finish. That thankfully doesn't linger very long."
"D- Very nice beer and wish I was able to get more of this. Would highly recommend to others."
"Brown with hints of amber throughout this brew. Small head that dies a bit. With a smell of Brett, Cherries and plum. A sour taste upfront, but really nothing too overpowering. As for a strong ale, this tastes nothing like any I have tried. The oak is present in this brew, and I enjoy how it isn't overpowering. This beer is REALLY easy drinker. The alcohol is nowhere to be found on this one. At 9% I would be affraid of what this beer would do to me as I could drink many of these. Another solid brew by the Dexter people in Jolly Pumpkin."
"Charred toffee and sweetish fruit malt flavors up front. Tart cherry and citrus twang are also there early on, solidly on the edges of the palate. Sour, funky acidity crescendos and fades as rummy fruit sweetness, toffee, vanilla, and oak take over. Slightly warming finish with both the complex, sweetish, oaky malts and the acidic citrus funk lasting a good long while. Medium-full body with rollicking, bottle-conditioned carbonation. Almost syrupy in the finish. A wonderful new beer from Ron at JP! Glad to see the batch number label too. Awesome."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with good steady carbonation. Another Jolly Pumpkin brew that I can hog a 750ml of to myself without a problem. Seek this one out and you will enjoy. I look forward to try my other bottle of Blend 1 soon."
"A slightly hazy dark chestnut brown beer with ruby highlights. Has a small off white head. The aroma has a strong sour character with hints of apples and cinnamon. The sour character on the aroma starts out the taste but quickly changes to a very dry note with the hint of cinnamon hanging around in the back. As it warms some soft malt and malt vinegar note emerge."
"Blend 4, 2007. Pours a fully clouded and very dark orange brown with a minimal dark crème head. Nose is beautiful! Bringing the funk. Its like having a Flanders or a lambic even. Just wild yeast. I love it. On top of that there are noticeable sugars, minor wood tones., and just a nice, gentle perfume tone. Flavor is great. Nice use of spices that bring just the right level of character, but dont overpower things at all. Minor wood tones. Seems like there is a bit of a noticed alcohol tone. Just enough to notice it. Still all good though. Feel has a nice level of carbonation to it and a good liquid feel as well. Overall the contents are a bit thick and it becomes a sipper fairly soon into the game. But it is definitely well made and a nice one to drink. Something about this reminds me of that 1995 Marriage Parfait I had at Spuyten Duyvil."
"D- This beer has some good flavors that are very well blended. The tartness combined with wood and malt flavors makes this an excellent sipper especially in the cold winter months."
"750ml bottle, Blend 3, 2007. This was a chestnut color with red highlights, and a fairly small head. Pretty nice nose, mostly fruit with a little spice. Similar taste, but something in there gave it an almost medicinal taste, which was not at all enjoyable. This was an OK beer, but probably not one I'd try again."
"Pours barely a one finger cream head that fades quickly to a ring leaving no lace. Cloudy amber color. Light carbonation and light-medium bodied. Slight fruity nose. Flavor fruity, tart with hints of sweetness, clean, drying finish. High ABV is hidden. $11.50 for a 750ml bottle from Liquid Solutions Oregon City, Or."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, tart/sugary, well balanced."
"Notes of fig & plum blend nicely with the things hinted at it the nose. Notes of brown sugar creep in as it warms. Subtle oak flavour comes through as well. Finishes dry. Easy drinking, digestible, light bodied without being thin. Lively carbonation. A well executed holiday libation."
"Noel de Calabaza is yet another good beer from Jolly Pumpkin. It's refreshing to find all these great barrel aged sours so easily and affordable. Jolly Pumpkin does the beer drinking public a great service by offering these normally expensive hard to find styles in many locations and at an affordable price for such great beers. That's one of many reasons you will always find at least a couple Jolly Pumpkin offerings in my fridge at a time."
" I will be looking for more of these and looking forward to try more from this brewer"
"Just as good as I remembered it but there is a very intriguing maple and mint flavor on the finish that I am really enjoying"
"Batch 329, 2008 edition: Drier and toastier aroma, not as much sourness, less acidity, maltier. Taste is a little rougher, quite sweet and not much sourness. Some acidity in the finish but otherwise a lot sweeter than the older versions."
"Purchased: Plaza Liquors, Tucson AZ"
"I'll be seeking more of this, too bad it was such a limited release, After sampling from the barrel of this at FOBAB in Chicago, I was a little apprehensive...that one was very farmy and unpleasant. No complaints with the bottle version!"
"Served at cellar temp."
"Deep dark color with a huge tan/cocoa head that goes on forever. Peppery, spicy aroma. Heavy, sugary smell to it. Black pepper really dominates. Crisp and spicy flavor. Odd sort of woody funk. Sharp, black peppery taste. Great metallic bitterness. A ton of flavors meld into one. Nice, thin and lighter mouthfeel. Dry. Very drinkable and enjoyable. I love the peppery flavor and aroma. A lot going on here but it works very, very well."
"Active mouthfeel. Fine bubbled tight carbonation, a bit prickly on the tongue and stays all the way through the dry finish. Thinish body"
"Pours a rich dark brown borderline black color with a creamy light brown head. A good amount of lacing sticks around. Smell is of toasted malt with some sweetness and yeasty belgian aroma. Taste is sweet with dried fruit and a full mouthfeeling that lingers with the lively carbonation."
"D- Very unique beer, I would peg this is a sour fruity lambic and not a Belgian strong dark ale, there is a lot of wine character here and only fans of sours will come back for this one, this is the only JP beer I have had and I am looking forward to see how it compares to others from this brewery"
"Drinkability- Wonderful stuff. I'll be getting this stuff again. Great for a cold evening where you want to watch the rain or the fire place."
"Lemon, lemongrass and damp concrete aromas, along with wild sour honey and sour red cherries, peel away gradually to reveal slight chocolate and mulling spices. Warm sensations of dried cranberries and currants mingle with burnt sugar flavors. Tangy, bronzed whole wheat sugars and starches lead to boozy, demerara rum flavored sweet tannins. The finish is dry and punctuated with mild bitterness."
"Edit 7/7/08: Popped open another bottle of Blend 3. Still holding up quite nicely. Appearance is much better than last time with a beautiful, creamy head that leaves a ton of lacing on the Koningshoeven glass. Rating now I'd probably give it a 5/4.5/4.5/4.5/4.5."
"Overall, it has a definite Jolly Pumpkin character. I didn't like it as much as others. It would be better with more sourness and less dryness."
"D- This beer really grew on me. I wasnt too sure about it at first. I could tell it was ok, but as I got through it really made a great impression on me."
"D: It's like lemonade on a hot day. It's that good. It's full of flavor, yet light and refreshing. Outstanding."
"25.4 ounce bottle, Blend 2, 2007. Served in a chalice, the beer pours dark brown with about an inch tan head. Head retention and lacing are both OK. It smells like Belgian funk, dark fruit (cherries, plums), tart fruit and some spice. Taste is similar to the aroma, however I can taste some oak in there too. It's more tart/sour than it is sweet, but it's a very nice taste overall. The spice and sweetness kicks in a little more as the beer warms. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it has a lot of carbonation but not too much. Drinkability is good, the beer is smooth and very easy to drink. The alcohol isn't very noticable at all. Overall I think this is a pretty good beer, I'll have to try and pick up another bottle of this soon."
"D - Jolly pumpkin nailed this one. Very good."
"Dark brown with a super foamy head. The first sniff of the bottle is tart funk and some spice. Smelling the glass brings heavy funk with possibly chocolate hiding behind and cherries and a few fumes. The flavor is strong sour, some flavors like grapes, no noticeable alcohol, body is not thick and the finish isn't dry like the fuego I had the other day. This is a good beer, especially if you like sours, but didn't do the trick for me as other Jolly Pumpkin beers have."
"D: Probably the only JP beer I've been somewhat dissapointed in after all of the hype, good, but not great."
"drinkability: I know where I bought this and Im going back for more."
"great stuff!"
"The best JP beer I have tried. Very palate friendly and complex with a big alcohol burn on the finish in the throat and chest. Slightly sweet, sour brett hints full of spicey, earthy fruit estered character. Oak really does its part with this one and balances things nicely, keeps the brett at bay and leaves a vanilla, toffee flavor on the finish. Sour cherries, berries, slight nuttiness, with other fruits and yeast. Just a great warming beer."
"*I also love a beer that I can enjoy over the course of one or two hours. This fills that bill."
"Pours a cloudy deep amber, almost purple-ish in color with a white head. In the aroma just a sour, musty smell, with a nice yeasty malt. In the taste, small tartness and a roasty malt, with hints of a white grape fruitiness. A small sour, yet smooth mouthfeel and a dry sour and small fruity aftertaste. Not so much a winter, but very nice."
"Pours a slightly cloudy dark chestnut with a head that settles to a thin cap. Smell is sour and slightly spicy Smells a bit like spiced sour plums. Taste is sour and somewhat rich with more spice and a tannic finish. Very nice, but not quite as impressive as some of their other offerings.There is a softness and slight wateriness that I wish wasn't there. Mouthfeel is somewhat light and crisp with a sour tang. Very drinkable with no alcohol present in the taste.The usual from Jolly Pumpkin."
"The taste is very simillar to the regular Oro, but a bit more malt and wood comes through and again, the spices. Medium to full in the mouth with a nice funk/wood aftertaste. I will buy this again and enjoy it over the holidays."
"Fantastic contemplative beer."
