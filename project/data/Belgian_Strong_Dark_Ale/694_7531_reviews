"Amazing that 11% ABV can be so subtle. High marks for the beer's ability to subdue any hints of burn with a great balance of flavors from cherries to cinnamon to bready malt. A seasonal treat that could be enjoyed all year."
"great stuff very smooth for 11.00 %"
"This is the 3rd time of had it.  This time I taste the cherry - big, right up front.  I love cherries, but this is a bit much.  Strong  and full flavored. Syrupy sweet, and alcoholic.  A bit overpowering, and a challenge to drink.  I'm not looking for a beer to challenge me very often.  I don't think I'll look for again.  Not terrible, I don't hate it."
"This is an insanely sweet, sugary beer. An absolute one and done beer. How they have 11% in such a sweet tasting beer is beyond me. Best for Holidays"
""
"Great on tap, but if you buy it bottled it needs to be aged. Get a six and cellar it for a year or two. Solid for a cold winter night, a sipper of the first order."

"What a Fantastic Brew! this is one of those Beers, that as soon as you pop that top and smell it,your heart starts racing,and you just know it is going to be something very special ~and Indeed it is,the nose is sweet,with Honey and a hint of Cherries and malts,~the taste pretty much follows the nose,sweet[but not cloying] you pick up the Honey and though you do get a nice Cherry note, it is more in the background then in your face,and does not have that ""Cough Drop"" Medicinal taste you get with a beer like ""Sam Adams Cherry Wheat""~taste more like fresh cherries,and it IS Tasty as Hell,also would never know this Beer is 11% A.B.V.,Because I do not ever get that alcohol burn or boozy tatse,but perhaps that is Because I drink a lot of High A.B.V. Strong Beer's and Ales~this is not a Beer you knock back with your buddies while watching the Game or playing Poker,this is a Top Notch [IMHO]  World Class Brew,it is a Beer you Savor and take your time to enjoy it's Amazing Flavors and the brewer's Art,what a BEER! Cheers 2 All;]"

"Very surprised. Underestimated this beer (probably based on the label looking somewhat silly). I'll pick this up again next Christmas."

"One of the better beers I've had in the ""holiday"" genre. Pleasantly spiced and sporting a serious malt bill. I would have liked the noble hop bite to be more assertive, the spice notes I detected were more Belgian yeast than saaz peppery spice. Cherries and clove/cinnamon up front, with brown sugar on the back. This will be something I look forward to every winter."
""
""
""
"Drink it while it's cold or it tastes like cherry cough syrup"
"Amazing beer very rich and strong and the high abv is completley masked by its rich malty complex flavor"
""
""
"Maybe not for everyone and tasted better out of the tap.  Cherries jump out at you and grab it when you first see it as it doesn't stay on shelves too long."
""
"i didn't get much cherries or honey flavor... maybe a little more would of been better.."
"Tastes awful. Love Troegs but the spice flavor was too much."
"Honestly this beer is nasty...tastes like feces"
""
"Overall, I am impressed.  This is the first time I am actually drinking one of these beers. Someone sent this to me as an extra and I thought I would drink it to make room in my refrigerator.  This has probably opened up a new dimension in my beer drinking realm."
""
""
"Overall:  This an excellent beer!  I love the fruit and malt, which is balanced beautifully with the Belgian yeast.  Strong bold flavors.  Great Christmas beer!  Hell, great beer period!"

"Strong Dark Belgian's are my favorite style but I have avoided the Mad Elf due to my beer guru telling me this one was not very good.  But got one in my stocking for Christmas so here we go.  Poured a clear red with some carbonation and very little head.  Some lacing but it would slide down the glass.  Decent smell with the dark fruit and cherry but the alcohol overwhelms it, smelled a little like alcohol soaked cherries.  Taste is similar,  you pick up the cherry and malt but again it is overwhelmed by the alcohol, just kind of off.  They made it strong but not very balanced.  It gets easier to drink as I went along but was still not what I would call enjoyable.  Some lip licking from the malt which was good.  The beer is almost thin, certainly not the rich texture I enjoy in the style.  Overall, average at best.  Beer guru was right yet again."
"Super high ABV, it was the holiday and I had to give it a try.  Not my kind of beer but worth a try!"
""
"was expecting a little more. Taste was ok.. appearance definitely caught my eye"
""
""
""
"Good holiday feelings in a glass. I look forward to this beer every year."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I used to like the beer much more than I do now. It's a bit hyped."
""
"Tastes a bit too much like fermented cherry juice topped off with vodka for my taste but an interesting beer that some people love for its uniqueness and holiday festivity"

"O:  I was really looking forward to this beer and to be completely honest, I was a bit let down. The aromas and flavors are subtle, and I think this is not a good representation of what a Belgian Strong Dark Ale truly is. It seems a bit too ""mild"" for the style if that even makes sense. The one thing I must say is that the alcohol is masked extremely well for 11% ABV. So much so that If you told me it was 11% without me seeing proof, I wouldn't believe you. I would drink this beer again if it was free, but I most likely won't buy it again."
""
""
"Eh....just decent. I don't think I'd get it again."
""
"Alcohol doesn't hide much in this beast. Had it years ago and loved it, but I think it was aged a bit. Nope to revisit this vintage in a few years."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A very well balanced beer.  I could get used to drinking this every Christmas.  Will have to buy a current vintage bottle to compare against the 2013."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall though, I just find it a little too intense to keep up with.  Tasty yes, but hard to have more than one of."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Great holiday beer. I feel like 2014 not quite as good as previous years, less cherry taste"
"Overall I like the beer, but I have two complaints. The lack of a strong Belgian yeast flavor and the lack of head retention. Otherwise, its perfect for the season. I tried vertical batches from 2012-2014 and it does age well."
""
"Overall, this is a good beer and I enjoyed it."
""
"o: Sweet and fruiity, as might be expected of a brew made with Belgian yeast, honey and cherries.  The combination tastes more like plums but it hides most of the alcohol in this Belgian strong dark.  Net effect is a tasty and powerful holiday ale.3.75"
""
"An interesting beer for the holiday"
""
"Amount of Honey used is over-the-top with the amount of Cherries being over-the-top-of-the-top.  A simply ridiculous beer by the master brewer Chris Troeg!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Ruby red with a small off white head that fades very fast and leaves no lacing.  Aromas of cherries, honey, caramel, light chocolate, and medicinal.  Taste opens heavy cherry and honey flavor, slight medicinal quality, burnt caramel and alcohol heat comes through.  Well carbonated up front gives way to a smooth finish and full body.  This is a nice change of pace, but alcohol heat and medicinal flavors keep it from being truly great."

"I am not a big holiday beer guy. Pumpkin, Oktoberfest, XMAS, etc. Had to give Troegs a chance though. Found one reasonably priced (couple of bucks). This sat really nice, though. Smelled and tasted the cherries, nice Belgian yeast, and warming booziness. Taste of alcohol, however, was well-hidden for a 12% beer. Smooth mouthfeel. Might be my fave XMAS brew. Still have a couple more stragglers to try, though. Cheers!"

"Based on the nose alone, which was super heavy in both cherries and honey, I wouldn't have even finished the bottle. But the flavor was actually pretty nice. Honestly couldn't even detect the cherries. Not my thing but certainly drinkable."
""
""
""
"I think you either love this, or not.  For me, it's not really what I think of when I think of beer.  It's certainly nice in appearance and a swirl of fruit and spice and perfumy scents.  The taste is more of the same, but with a significant alcohol punch, making it more of a sipping beer.  At first, I didn't think I was going to finish my draft, but it slowly grew on me.  Again, not my preference, but I can see why people might enjoy this.  I kept thinking this might be good warmed.  It's worth trying, but split it with someone just in case."

"A bit too cherry for me but a bold taste. Sweet, strong and ""festive"""
""
"Now, be good little boys and girls, and take your medicine!  I was told I'd be knocked off my seat once I tried Mad Elf.  Well, that didn't happen, and Mad Elf was a lot milder than I expected, but I will tell you, it definitely tastes like medicine.  The cherry and the alcohol both hit your tongue right away.  Even the dark cherry color reminds me of something medicinal.  There is a definite cough-syrupy finish that I wouldn't say I hate, but it didn't do me any favors either.  Overall, this is an acceptable brew in small quantities.  I wouldn't want to drink too much of it, and I definitely wouldn't want it all the time."

"At first taste it honestly tasted like a flavored steely. Boozy and totally not what I expected. Also, I was initiating my taste buds for cherries and honey. You can get hints of the cherry after a few more sips. For 11%, the more I drank the more I realized it was pretty smooth. Definitely a different beer but glad I got it. $14.99 for a 6-pack at a retail store. 3.8/5"

""
""
""
"I've gone back and forth in this beer, almost from bottle to bottle.  It seems to me to be a beer I have to be in the mood for, but I'm never sure what that mood is.  Will likely grab a pour of this and/or a six pack each year."

"amazing and complex flavor, slightly sweet though the cherry flavor is rather subtle"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured from a bottle into a snifter, the beer is a bright, vibrant, ruby coloring, with a  slow flow of carbonation and a sparse, filmy, off-white surface coating of head. Aromas of very rich, sugary fruit notes of cherry, fig, date, as well as notes of bubble gum, cotton candy, a blend of nutmeg and cinnamon spice, rich honey, tangy caramel,  and woody notes. There's an overall roast character dancing around in there, too. Flavors are rich and sweet forward, with an undertone of cinnamon, nutmeg, and clove. Sweet flavors are caramel, an old-world fruit blend, cherry tart and sweet, rich honey, and earthy notes. There is a subtle booze warmth that builds as you drink. Solid. The beer is slick and light in mouth, despite all the heavy palate notes. There is a tangy fruit sweetness in the aftertaste, with some of the booze lingering around. The finish is slick, slightly oily, with a decent fruit and booze linger. Good beer."

"O: Not bad. I was honestly expecting a winter warmer when I picked this up, as opposed to a Belgian ale. I don't know if I'll repeat this one when it's on shelves next to Trois Pistoles for a comparable price point, but it was a pleasant surprise."
""
""
"This beer makes Christmas fun again."
""
""
""
""
""
"I have had this before, and always found that the alcohol finish at the end reduced my enjoyment.  Just opened a bottle that a friend kept in his cellar for close to a year.  The beer aged quite well, in my opinion.  The sweetness from the cherries and honey was still quite prominent, as was the yeast spice.  But it seemed to me that it had mellowed and become smoother in terms of the alcohol heat.  I am now motivated to pick up six to put away for next year."

"Overall: It's pretty average stuff for a Belgian Strong Dark Ale. It has a slightly lighter mouthfeel than what is experienced traditionally, so if you find standard BSDA's to be too thick this might be right up your alley. For me it is a bit too light. It has a decent amount of flavor to keep me interested and enjoying the beer. I am disappointed in the distinct lack of honey and cherry flavor. For a BSDA it's a good beer but for a spiced holiday ale it lacks what people crave in a holiday beer. Drinking this early (at the end of October) with no presence of the advertised flavors, I can only imagine how it will taste in two months..."

"O- Regardless of category, this is a well-crafted beer...and perhaps one of the best in Troegs' profile. It blurs the lines between a Belgian Quadruple, Belgian Dark Ale, Fruit Beer and English Strong Ale. Very Unique and again, very well executed. If you have a love for big Belgian inspired beers, this is a must try! (4.5)"

"Overall, a nice beer, but not one that blows me away by any means. It's simple and unassuming, but is having to fight an uphill battle against my expectations for the style. Just a bit more depth of flavor--maybe some bitterness to counter the sweetness, or some flavor profiles beyond the sweet would be helpful."

"22 ounce bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 8/18/2013. Pours fairly crystal clear ruby red color with a 2 finger fairly dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty lacing clings on the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big raisin, plum, cherry, pear, apple, fig, light banana, honey, caramel, toast, candi sugar, bread, light chocolate, light nuttiness, herbal, light clove, light bubblegum, and yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/bready malt and fruity/earthy yeast ester notes; with good strength. Taste of big raisin, plum, cherry, fig, pear, apple, light banana, honey, caramel, toast, light chocolate, candi sugar, bread, light nuttiness, light clove, herbal, light bubblegum, and yeast earthiness. Lingering notes of raisin, plum, cherry, fig, pear, apple, light banana, honey, caramel, toast, candi sugar, light chocolate, light clove, herbal, bread, light nuttiness, and herbal/yeast earthiness on the finish for a while. Very nice complexity of dark/bready malt and yeast ester flavors; with a nice malt/yeast flavor balance and zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Alcohol is well hidden with only a small warming present after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice Belgian strong ale. All around good balance and complexity of dark/bready malt and fruity/earthy yeast ester flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the big ABV. A very enjoyable offering."

"While I think 1 is plenty for me in a sitting, this is a decent American take on the Belgian strong dark ale style. The cherry and honey additions give it character that helps elevate Mad Elf above other similar brews. I won't go hunting more but this is something I would certainly enjoy again someday."

"O: While reviewing this, it strikes me that my opinions of it are not really all that high on this beer in individual metrics, and yet I quite like the beer. Really a nice, unique holiday ale that doesn't overdo its ""holiday"" flavors, while doing a really nice job of dealing with its 11abv. Drinks much closer to 9, but with a little bit of heat. Bumping this up a bit in overall for that reason; I think this beer comes together quite nicely."

"I really enjoyed Troegs Mad Elf. It had a great after taste and for having a high ABV, it was pretty smooth. The only problem I found with it, as well as others around my have said, is that it's one of those beers you could only have one or two in one sitting. Overall a great beer for the holidays."

"Got this as an extra but forget from who. Thanks awesome trader. Bottle says 2010-2011 so I assume this has been in a cellar for a while. Pours murky amber colored with nearly no head at all. A nice aroma of super sweet caramel, cherries, honey, some booze, maybe some Belgian yeast influence. Flavor is bready malt with a bit of yeast spice, definite sweet cherry presence, caramel, plums, figs. Big heavy slick mouthfeel with low carbonation. Definitely on the sweet side but pretty enjoyable. A bit of oxidization has settled in but that's ok. I would have this again."

"Although this beer was tasty and hid its high alcohol presence remarkably well, I found the syrupy cherry flavor to be overdone and the resulting beer to be rather cloying. I would love to see how this beer tastes without the addition of honey, as it certainly does not need it."

"Mad Elf pours a reddish color with no head. There are strong Belgian candy flavors, with good hints of cherries. The taste has strong cherry flavors, lots of Belgian candy notes, and a yeasty like aftertaste. Very full body, and full flavors. Overall its a sweet and spicy beer."

"Visited the Troegs brewery last week and had Mad Elf on tap, excellent. Bottled version is very good, sweet winter warmer with a deceptive alcohol kick. At 11% abv! it sneaks up on you. Very good beer and worthy if stocking up the fridge for those long, cold winter nights."

"The head is on the thin side, a semi-deep tan color, not very dense and evaporates swiftly, average lacing without much stick. The liquid is an attractive coppery red with a dark orange tint, large amount of super tiny bubbles swirl about inside, excellent clarity does not weaken the richness of hue, handsome. The nose is full but not soft, filled with sweet honey, molasses, baking spices , candied orange peel and a mix of cola and chocolate, the cherries come through clearly, consistent and unambiguous, no secrets hidden. Full-bodied, Walks at a good pacing, not brisk, but on no leisurely stroll either, the carbonation fluffs it up when needed. The citrus is mixed but helps temper the honey, caramel, chocolate stuff. The cherry fruit base pulled in opposing directions by plum and strawberry flavors. Cola, maybe licorice, there is a sweet smokiness to it as well. Not really as well spiced as one might hope for a Belgian Strong Dark Ale, maybe more like a Winter Warmer. The length is so-so. In a fun and convivial environment you could easily through 3-4 of these back in spite of the ABV, alone at home, one, maybe two. There’s no intellectual hook."

"Pours a beautiful ruby amber with a reasonable head and lacing. The nose is of cherries against a slight chocolate coupled with a typical Belgian yeast aroma. It also has hints of sweetness and alcohol. Almost medium body with good carbonation. Nice slick mouthfeel. A superbly balanced beer, with a flavor profile similar to the nose. Tart cherry over a nice sweetness with a chocolate background. For an 11% alcohol brew, this one hides it well - but you get the nice burn all the way through. Crisp finish with a burst of flavor from the carbonation that brings the spice flavor to the forefront. The finish is also where the alcohol becomes more evident as the beer nears room temperature."

"Is there something different--and I don't mean better--about ME2013? My wife and I eagerly ordered pints last night at our favorite watering hole. We have enjoyed ME annually since about 2002, and eagerly anticipate it's release each year. But this year--at least last night, In Chester, MD--it tasted like a different brew. Very malty, as usual, but a distinct lack of the cinnamon, cardamom, anise, and other wintry spices we thought we were used to. Still drinkable, but we did not go back for seconds!"

"What a fabulous beer. Drinks a lot like mead. It has a bit of stickiness in the mouthfeel that is wonderful and pleasant. The drink is bold yet refined. Troegs makes great beer."
"smells of cherry, chocolate, bready caramel grain bill. the flavor is a bit medicinal.. lots of fruity, wheat bread, toasty, nutty, biscuity.. this is fantastic. full body, medium carbonation.. this hits you pretty hard right away. a heavy, true to the definition of winter warmer, this beer heats you up quick - heavy but delicious."
""
""
"A decent holiday ale that is very faithful to the Belgian tradition. A bit boozy and thin on the flavor."
""

It is amazing, every time I head to the local totalwine or other brew shop I pick up a sixer(14.99), It is an amazing seasonal brew for the cold months and I could see myself drinking this well into March. You must give it a chance, and at 11% ABV... it is highly recommended. haha."

I think there are better strong belgian ales out there, but still overall a good beer and can understand the hype."

"O- a really good Holiday/Christmas ale. No one aspect overpowers but it all blends together quite nicely."
""
""
""
""
"Beer pours red with little head and thin lacing. Smells like very little. Highly generic nose. Some faint cherries and sugary malt. A general ""beer"" scent. It's a little like cracking a coors. Tastes like fake cherries and brown sugar. Very sweet. Not too pleasing, but I'm trying to get through it. Consistency is slick, syrupy, and sticky. Pretty flat. This didn't quite work, imo. It's interesting, but ultimately a flop in my eyes."
""
""
""
""
" O- This is a unique beer. I am glad I finally got to try it and I got to try a fresh one. I think I will pick up a 6 pack and lay some down. I think when some of the heat burns off, even more of the subtle flavors will come out. I can see why this is a holiday favorite!"

"O: Not terribly complex, a straightforward example of the style. Would not turn down."
""
""
""
""

"This beer is better on draft than in the bottle.  Sometimes it comes off a little too boozy, but it has nice holiday flavors, and there are some good citrus, orange, and spice notes."

""
""
"Overall this was a pretty good beer. It definetley would not be my first pic but its a super talked about beer in the winter time so i figured it was time to pop the mad elf cherry haha. This beer is a definite sipper, and you can somewhat tell its 11%abv. just a ton of sweetness( probably the honey now that i think about it, duh...) and a ton of cherry. with some very mild heat from the alcohol. its a pretty nice beer. I wouldnt get it again, but id never turn it down."
""
""
""
""
"O: As a BSDA, it's really good but not quite my favorite of the style. As a general sweet-and-boozy monster, though, it's excellent. About the only thing I can complain about is how sweet it is - and this problem can be solved simply by getting the 6-packs or a 12 oz single instead of a bomber."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A must buy every Christmas for me. Great beer on a cold night, especially considering the sneaky 11%abv.  Beautiful ruby color, not a ton of lacing. Flavor is sweet at first, with cherry as the predominant flavor. Malt rounds it out and finishes slightly dry. Could be a little more balanced, but overall a great beer."

"Pours a clear dark honey orange with a foamy bone head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Tiny dots of lace slowly drip into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is of malt, honey, cherry, and cherry syrup aromas. Taste is much the same with sweet malt and cherry flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of toasty bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and sticky mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that is tasty but fairly syrupy and sweet."

"Tis the season for a nice full flavor beer. Troegs Mad Elf has a wonderful taste combination of Cherries, Honey, Dark Chocolate, and spice. This beer has a nice red appearance, and should be enjoyed responsibly. (I've sampled more then one on a occasion or two.) Another beer that is limited supply, and can run out faster then it comes in. Most distributors and bottle shops are kept in the loop to how much, and when they can receive it. (So make good friends with your local beer guy!)"

"This is my all time favorite beer. I refer to it as ""The Closer"" especially from a night of tasteing other quality craft beer. This beeer always is a pleasure to drink and usually puts me in that special place. If you haven't had this then you really are missing something special."

"This year was the first time I had the pleasure of enjoying Mad Elf, when I tasted it at a craft beer tasting. After that I had bought the six pack once, and since it’s so damn expensive I never cared to do it again regardless of how good it is. That was probably two months ago. Tonight however my lovely girlfriend was in the mood for it so I’m drinking it at her expense (thanks baby)! Anyway, this ale is like a mead or a sweet wine and very appropriate on bitter cold winter nights to warm the blood pleasantly. It has a gorgeous color and a wonderful aroma to be appreciated for a while before you actually indulge in to the liquid itself. Its taste is kind of like cocktail cherries with honey laced in between, and a hint of liquor. The inclusion of chocolate malts leave a chocolaty aftertaste with a spiciness on the tongue that I can’t put my finger on. This is a heavy beer with a high ABV that should be consumed slowly, and enjoyed to its fullest, perhaps even shared with a friend."

"O- I think I just realized that this was the first BSDA I ever fell in love with. So easy to drink with such high alcohol content. I'm sorry, but that's just a winner for me. Such a shame it doesn't have a higher average BA score."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This beer is pretty easy to drink due to the fact that the rather high ABV is well hidden. This is a good sipping beer, with a decent amount of complexity but too strong for anything other than slowly sipping."

""
""
""
""
""
""

"O- I want with longing for the end of fall to get here to get this beer each year. It is still one of my favorites. It's a sweet beer and very drinkable. However at 11% you have to force yourself to take it slow. Great winter beer."

"This was love at first taste. Dark cherries, spice, and caramel. It looked dark and foreboding (which is what I like), but it was soft, smooth, and delicious. The smell threw me off a little bit and made me nervous before the first sip, but that is the only negative thing I could say about it. This is one of those beers I could drink every day for the rest of my life and be content, though my organs would fail."

"Taste is definitely past its prime at this point, but I am surprised at how long the cherries have held on. Malts are somewhere in between a Belgian dubbel and a carmely barleywine. The yeast makes its mark and is a good choice for this beer, feels very 'Belgian' with more age. The alcohol is well disguised and well integrated with the heavy malt. I like this beer better when around the 1-2 year mark, but this was a fun experiment nonetheless. This beer seems to have plenty of detractors, but I find it to be quite delicious at any point in the aging cycle."
""
""
"From notes, 1/28/11. Bottle. This beer is a bit of a sweet mess. It certainly drinks smoother than its 11% abv, but that’s the best thing about it. It pours a very red amber color with a small off-white head. The aroma is sugar cane, cherries, honey and some fruity Belgian yeast notes. The taste is sweet with a somewhat cloyingly sweet finish. It’s just a bit of a mess. The flavors don’t really clash, but it’s cloying upon cloying. It’s actually a lot like what I imagine an elf would drink, a sort of fruity beer nectar. Mouthfeel is sticky but otherwise fine. I’m being a bit harsh, but it’s just too over-the-top for me. Lots of sweet flavors in this one."

"From tap, this was dark, burgandy/amber color. It smelled and tasted of dark but sweet cherries with mulling-type spices. Neither the sweetness nor spice was overpowering as in some other similar strong dark ales. Drinking this is very much like drinking Christmas, back before it became commercialized."
""
""
""
"O - This is definitely a sipping beer due to the sweetness and high ABV. Unique mixture of flavors. I would get this again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The ABV was a bit too high and prevented long term drinking, but perhaps this cannot be avoided. I hope that I drink it again."
""
"You're supposed to drink Mad Elf out of a glass or chalice, but I had it straight from the bottle on this occasion. I recommend using a glass, because I couldn't smell the beer as well. I got a decent mouthful of both honey and cherry flavor when I tasted it (with moderate carbonation) and the spicy flavors lingered on my tongue, which I enjoyed."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: In hindsight, I'm not sure why I bought this beer. I'm not a huge fan of the style and I tried as much as possible to enjoy it, but it's just not growing on me as I drink it more. At least I know to pass on buying it next year and I'm thankful I only got one."
""
""
""
"I remember liking this a lot more in past years. It just seems to be searching for an identity it can't find. Somewehere between a fruit beer and a Belgian dark ale, it almost finds itself closer to a spicy, less oaky barleywine. Maybe I've just been spoiled with great beer lately. It's still good, it's just not much more than that."

"Overall, not a bad holiday beer. I enjoyed it, however this time of year is the only time."
""
""
""
"Pours a deep amber to red with just a bit of head that disappates quickly. Little lacing left on the glass. Aroma is cherries and sweet honey - easily detectable. Taste is strong - slight alcohol presence but not surprising at this strength. Reinforces much of the nose - cherries are slightly sour and present up front through the middle where the honey takes over on the finish."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A very strong Belgium ale that as a sweet taste that counteracts the alcohol taste very well, a slight hint of cherry flavoring, which is nice, unlike other Cherry Flavored beers that can be to overpowering and taste like cough syrup. the smell is sweet and robust. mouthfeel is smooth as it enters your lips. overall i gave the beer a 5 and i highly suggesst that you get this beer it is very much a winner in my book."
""
"M: Big medium."
""
"Thanks to baybum for this one!"
"Medium body, medium carbonation that's pretty much right on target for a Belgian style brew. Moderately smooth and sticky. In the end this is a pretty solid take on a dark Belgian but its a bit sweet for my tastes and doesn't surpass the better iterations from overseas."
""
""
""
"Overall, a little disappointed but this is quite warming and it is pretty cold here today. Will keep sippin on it, but nothing I would rush out to buy again."
""
""
""
""
"Awesome just the right amount of ""heat"" and sweet! Wish I had picked up two of these. Got it in the bomber bottle and am three sips into it and bumming out about has little is left. It is the good! Lots of smooth maktyness and a nice bitey cherry finish! Merry Christmas!!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- a string beer that will sneak up on you, however the alcohol is hidden quite well and the cherries make it an enjoyable sipper."
""
"O: Very festive. Alcohol is well hidden. More malts pop through as it warms. A mad elf worth catching."
""
""
""
""
"O - Really good, crisp on the palette."
""
""
"O - An absolutely fantastic holiday treat, Tröegs Mad Elf is a masterful concoction of subtle Belgian yeast that produces spice nuances without the straight addition of spice. Honey sweetness never becomes cloying but adds a little something extra with the delicate cherry tartness. Just as exceptional fresh, age continues to do this strong beer favors, developing into a delectable and soothing winter sipper."
""
""
"This beer is the first to emerge from my cellar after a short two month sleep. The beer pours a ruddy ruby, with a light, gently cream colored head. The body of the beer is clear and caramelly with little to no carbonation coming up through. On the nose the beer smells big with honeyed raisins, slight candied sugars, bready caramel, and only the faintest ghost of cherry. Spicy alcohol, similar to what you might find in a quad, is also definitely present in the nose. The beer tastes lightly of cherries and honey, transitioning into bready caramel and Belgian yeast character, with a light alcohol spice. The beer begins with an almost framboise like cherry sweet flavor, mixed quickly with spicy alcohol and then creamy honey which opens the beer into grainier caramel and Belgian yeast notes, and light candied sugars. There is a huge cereal bread taste in the middle of the flavor which dies off quickly, but does leave a light bread lingering in the finish and aftertaste. This beer is hugely complex in flavor, and with only 2 months in the cellar it seems to have none of the huge alcohol flavors that other reviewers describe. On the mouth this beer is smooth and caramelly, sitting on the tongue at a medium to heavy body with nearly no carbonation to speak of. The only bite comes from the faint alcohol at the back of the throat, but this is really quite faint, and considering this is 11%, I really don’t taste the heavy alcohol flavor. Overall, I’m a huge fan of this beer. It is a great holiday sipper, to be had in moderation for sure. I could obviously not slug this beer back, but if you put it in a small glass, swirl it around and observe its holiday appropriate color, and then savor and enjoy it. It kisses the tongue, packs a wallop of alcohol, and seduces my taste buds with warm sweet flavors that I want in a holiday beer. A beer to have on Christmas night for sure!"
""

"O: NIce enjoyable winter holiday ale. Good cherry flavor that isn't overly sweet and the spiciness works well with the heat form the alcohol. Would def get a sixer to enjoy on a cold winter night."
""
""
"O: a nice winter time beer, deffiantly a sipper for a cold night, especially if you like spicy Belgian yeast. The only thing holding me back from giving a higher score here is that i personally not a fan of spicy Belgian yeast, and by that I mean cloveyness, that's the best way I can explain it, but if you are a fan I could see how this is an excellent brew."
""
""
""
""
"O: First off I tried this beer for the first time last year solely for the name/label (with the drunk elf) and the abv so ill give it that as selling point. The taste is decent but did not blow me away above average for sure but not greatness same is true for the mouthfeel. The fact that blows me away and will keep me coming back to this beer is the back that the abv is 11% and its totally drinkable., the average person wouldn't even notice. Needless to say it will warm you up quick during the holidays and as long as its tasty ill take it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Of course the 11 percent is off the chain but I thoruoghly enjoy this brew."
""
"this is the quintessential holiday brew for me, i look forward to it each year, and have been cellaring different vintages for experiment. i find a year really cools down the alcohol heat and lets the flavors develop. the fresh one im drinking now pours a rich cherry amber color, with a sexy frothy pearly white head nearly three inches tall. the nose is lots of fruity, cherries, plums, baked pears, lots going on. also some honey or molassas sugar, a lot of booze, and a curious blend of winter spices, a little heavy on the clove. the flavor is identical to the nose, if a bit less fruit forward. its very balanced, and you dont taste the alcohol as much as you smell it, but you sure do feel it. whew. belgian yeast and candy sugar work magically together, creating a velvety grog that is sure to warm up the coldest bones in the winter time. relaxed carbonation and about as full a body as you can have in a beer that still lets some light pass through it. it gets really hot in terms of booze as it warms up, but thats just fine by me. overall one beer that is not to be missed come christmas time, and one that i keep going back to again and again. if you get youself a case, put a few in the basement until next year too, youll be glad you did!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall: Again, there's just something going on in the ending, be it strong booze and/or coriander, that just doesn't do it for me. I bet that if you let this age, the cherries will eventually hit harder on the back end. I don't know if aging can fix this, but one can dream...can't they?"
""
""
""
""
""
"Drink- I was given a few bottles of this. I will hold some back for a year or two and see what happens as the 11% mellows and fades and just changes this beer. I can see good things but not really fresh."
""
""
""
""
"O: Good beer, easy drinking (though the alcohol comes through a bit), and a tasty BSDA with great fruit character."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall: A nice offering. Pronounced, interesting flavors and definetly enough of an abv to warm things up."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This was a really nice beer. I thought it had great balance and flavor. The cherries were a nice touch to the Belgian yeast and spice. They aren't tart or sour. I was very impressed. I would have given a higher score if the flavor was more than cherries with underlying notes meaning I wish it had more of a Belgian character. As it is this is a very good beer that is definitely worth your time."
""
""
"Overall: This is a complex beer but I think it could be a little more balanced for more drinkability. However, considering the alcohol content in this brew, it surprisingly doesn’t override the taste. It’s an interesting beer, but probably not for everyone. I personally find it a nice switch from the more traditional, spicy winter warmers or Christmas ales."

"O: Troegs pulls of a fantastic American interpretation of the style. Perfect for sipping."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A bold ale in more ways than one. I can really envision this one only improving with age, allowing the flavors and alcohol character to mellow."
"This is a very spicey and sweet winter warmer. I would never guess that this brew is 11% ABV, one can not taste the alcohol at all. Everthing mixes nicely, and the 11% alcohol, along with the spice, gives a warming feeling. I could easily drink a case of these."
""
""
"Poured into a 13 oz tulip glass. Pours a beautiful amber, with a half inch of off white head, that leaves some lacing. Smell is cherry, banana, clover, and biscuit. Taste is all of those things, really well balanced. Body is maybe medium, not much life, a little dry, and very approachable for its heft. This isn't my favorite style, but I do enjoy this beer."
""
"Overall - like I said, one of my very favorite winter/Xmas offerings...keep up the good work Troegs Brothers! Again aging works nicely in this brew."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured into chalice; dark orange to red, slightly cloudy, with a single-finger fizzy head that dissipated quickly leaving no lacing. Smell is yeasty and wheaty, maybe a bit of some spicyness or fruit (could be the cherry it's brewed with). Taste is smooth and sweet, finishing pretty cleanly with warming alcohol. Quite drinkable, but best in slow sips. Mouthfeel is pretty smooth and full."
""
""
""
"Pours deep copper with ruby highlights and a thin tan head. Aromas of yeast, banana esters, bubble gum, and spices. Present in the background are sour cherries, dark fruits, and orange-poppy seed muffins. Cherries become more pronounced as this warms. Flavor is sour yeast and cherry, astringent spices, and a sour/spicy finish. Nice sweet and tangy mouthfeel, medium carbonation."

"Did not enjoy this. Came across as an overly sweet, sub-par tripel. Could have used a stronger cherry presence to offset the sugar. Finishing was somewhat of a chore and not a beer I would drink again."
""
"O- This is one hell of a seasonal beer. I am about finished with a 22oz now, and let me tell you....it will sneak up on you! I love the cherry flavor in such a big Belgian brew, and think it is somewhat original for a ""holiday beer"". I would highly recommend this one!"

"O: I don't think my description of this beer is particularly flattering, however I did enjoy it."

"O- Overall, i like this beer alot, though, some age does do it alot of good, just a tad boozy when fresh but it definitely settles down as its sipped on. Has a great bite, and ton of complexity, i always look forward to this beer come this time of year."
"This is the most over rated beer going right now. I have never been so disapointed in my life in a beer purchase. I have never met anyone who actually enjoys this. I love belgian beers and winter beers but this one just doesn't qualify as either. do yourself a favor and leave it on the shelf"

"Overall a tasty winter beer that I always look forward to. Nice american take on a belgian beer. Would love to try a few years of this in a row."

"Overall: Enjoyed the 2008 more, but the beer in general isn't my style"
""
""
"The mouthfeel is pretty light for all of the fruitiness. I realize that the yeast is contributing to the relatively dry finish, so the mouthfeel is accomplishing some positive things. Overall, this is a different take on the style. I appreciate it, but it's not really my thing."
""
""

"Ah it was alright, disappointing. Everything but the nose was less than I was hoping for. Thanks TATURBO."

""
""
"Addendum: Reading other people's reviews, I think I may have gotten a bad bottle. Mine had nearly zero carbonation. I'm going to bump the mouthfeel up to 2 for that, but I stand by the fact that it is too syrupy and tastes a bit like cherry cough syrup."

"Overall: Solid beer. I have had this before and happy to have stumbled upon this beer the other day in the back of the store."
""
""
""
""
"O: This definitely grew on me as the glass drained. Can get a little cloying, but ultimately it's pretty balanced, and the hiddenness of the alcohol is remarkable for 11%."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - I wanted to like this, but to be honest it was a struggle to get through the entire beer. I can't say that I'd seek this out again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: The warming quality and hidden alcohol makes this a pretty good sipper for cool evenings. It has just the right amount of sweetness."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The palate, OTOH, isn't as impressive. Like a mellower cough syrup, there's just something about the cherry character here that makes it medicinal. Moderately sweet with honey and fruit cake. Some cherry skin tannins are present to balance the sweetness. The spices seem a little more muted on the palate, and the mid-palate feels a little watery at times. Sweet on the finish with alcohol, some honey and cherry tartness, there's a lingering yeastiness as well. Carbonation is moderate, making this beer, to my palate and given the style, average at best and not one I'd seek to revisit in a hurry."
""
""
""
""
""
"o - Overall a pretty nice Belgian Strong Dark. Nose is very nice and full of cherries, though the taste wasn't quite as fruity. Definitely didn't feel like 11% ABV, would have it again next winter."
""
""
""
"Appears a nice red-auburn color with immediate smells of cinnamon, cherry, allspice and clove. The taste actually reminds you of the holidays. A warm sensation is felt with the fruitiness and array of spices that mask the high alcohol content really well. I look forward to this beer's release every year and make certain to store at least a 6-pack of bottles for Christmas in July. A must-drink during the holidays both for its great taste and its ability to make shopping interesting after just one or two."
""
""
""
""
"Deep ruby/blood red colour, ring of soapy white head, no lace at all. Smell is fruity and lightly funky, belgian yeast, some sweet cherry notes, spicy with some alcohol heat as well. Taste is spicy at first followed by tart cherry, some funky yeasty flavours, some alcohol in the first few sips but pretty much completley hidden after that. Medium-High carbonation, medium body, good full feel throughout. Not bad but nothing about this blew me away, dont think I would go looking for this but if it was offered its quite drinkable."
"Poured from bottle to Duvel tulip the beer pours a bright red color with a thin off-white head. Edges are red in color. Not much retention or lacing to report. The aroma is sweet and powerful with a lot of honey, cherry, pepper, and belgian yeast character. The flavor is just as the nose let on with a tart cherry sweetness upfront together with honey and belgian yeast character. Hides the alcohol extremely well, not detectable. Rich in flavor and mildly bitter. Medium bodied and well carbonated. Finishes smooth with a lingering cherry tart flavor. Overall, this was a treat to try. Good stuff!"
""
"This is one of my favorite winter brews. It is very drinkable which is the dangerous part. The alcohol content catches up with the drinker before they even notice. Generally a crowd pleaser and a nice one to age for a couple years. Might be hard to find now, so make sure you try it next holiday season."
""
"Overall; of all the winter brews I've had, this is unquestionably my favorite thus far... Typically I'm not a big fan of Belgians or the associated yeast but it blends very well with the cherries and honey in Mad Elf... My first Tröegs brew and I was not disappointed!! ISO; Nugget Nectar"
""
""
"O- I cannot drink this beer fresh. It is too sweet and boozy. With a year of age, it's much more drinkable, but I'm not an overly huge fan of it like many in the area are. Give me Nugget Nectar any day over this."
""
""
"O-Not sure what much of the fuss was about with this beer it was good but not great."
""
""
""
""
""
"O-I expected more..."
""
"O- I'm very impressed. I generally dislike BSDAs but this one is a winner. Can't wait to determine my cost/benefit analysis of drinking this beer"
""
""
""
""
""
"O - One of the beers that get me hooked on craft. I always look forward to its release each year. I still find this to be a solid beer, which I can't say about many of the beers I once thought were good."
""
"Pours ruby red with the slightest of off-white heads. Vanishes right away. Belgian spices and hints of cherry on the nose. Alcohol as well. Belgian spicy start to the flavor, not too agressive, but present. A bit of a saison-like funk as well. Viscous malts follow. Sweet, thick, caramel malt, hints of alcohol and the slightest hint of woodsy vanilla. Cherries and a bit more crisp spiciness closes it out."
""
"Cheers!"
""
""
""
"This was a good brew. The higher ABV was incorporated very well. This was not like any Belgian Strong I’ve ever had before. Not a real fan of fruit-themed beers."
""
""
""
""
"Cherry sugar malt thick belgian"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: a great beer! I love it when this comes out, I buy it every year."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - I must say that I was a little disappointed with this beer. It wasn't all bad for me, but the cherry cough syrup taste combined with a decent amount of alcohol presence prevented this from being too drinkable. I bet some age would improve this beer quite a bit, but I'm not sure I could purchase this one again."
""
""
"O: delicious. Super scary easy to drink. Love to cellar and do a vertical. Awesome high octane without sourness from the fruit."
""
"Tröegs Mad Elf is a very clear and dense, coppery red ale with a thin, sand colored head that fades to a film and leaves decent lacing on the glass. It has a very strong, sweet aroma of cherries. Deeper in the nose is a medicinal note. It’s pretty full bodied and syrupy with a slightly sticky finish. It has a pretty sweet flavor. Cherries are prominent but so is resiny wood. A little green bitterness comes in at the finish, along with black pepper. The aftertaste is kind of oaky and spicy."
"O: An uneven beer, to say the least. It has some good qualities, but others are less impressive."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Overall I just don't love to drink it. It tastes far too medicinal. The alcohol and the cherry juice drown everything else out and keep me from really enjoying this one."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-A great holiday/winter warmer for sure the 11% abv kicks in at the end, you want to be careful how many of this you're going to drink and be careful once you get up. I definitely could not drink this one all the time, but it was/is very nice for a change of pace. If you're a fan of Belgians; give this one a try."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: a great beer, not just a great holiday beer. It is expensive, but worth it. Age one if you get the chance."
""
"Glad to have tried this, but it is just a little bit too boozy for my liking and lacks complexity."
""
""
"Overall: This is beer is pretty much what it claims to be. A Belgian dark ale brewed with cherries so if that is your thing and you love cherries you will love this truth be told I could do without ever drinking this again. The 11% alcohol is very well hidden"
"This is a very good beer. They say they brew it with honey and cherries, but when drinking it you don't really get the honey notes as much as you get the cherry notes. Overall a great holiday beer and with the ABV being 11% it is sure to keep you warm on those cold winter days!"
""
"Overall - This one actually reminded me somewhat of the Midas Touch by DFH. It's not terribly complex tasting, but the alcohol is well hidden and it isn't as cloying as I expected. I'll pick some up again next winter."
""
""
""
"Taste-Spicy yeast, honey faint cherry. Flavors are muted and very mellow. Rather flat body but very smooth, as high ABV not evident. A fresher bottle might have gotten a better score."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I'm not super impressed with this one. A nice one off but not my favorite in the style by any stretch."
""
"O: Not horrible, but again, not too much to it. No head retention, and a bit cloying. I have one more bottle, which I'll probably drink at some point, but I wouldn't buy this one if it were available here."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a dark red/copper with a small off white head that didn't stay for long. The smell is sweet and yeasty with cherry and malt. The taste is very sweet, the yeast and fruit are very pronounced, but just a sweet beer overall. The high ABV is noticeable while sipping, but doesn't detract from the beer or mouthfeel. A medium body, good carbonation, and decent flavor balance. If the sweetness was taken down a bit this could be a top notch beer, but overall enjoyable."
""
""
""
""
""

"D- A pleasant variation on a winter warmer. The spicy yeast and the cherries are something that I look forward to each Winter."

"O- a very pleasant winter warmer. Sippin by the fire and shared with a couple people and all were pleasantly impressed."
""
""
"O: An awesome winter seasonal. I love what they do at Troeg."

"Updated March 2014: Sampled a glass of 2012 vintage on-tap. This beer is one that certainly gets much better with age. I am committed to buying a few bombers next Christmas for the sole purpose of designating them for cellaring."
""
""
"Overall, this is a decent beer, but not much better than that. I think if there were a bigger presence of tart cherries this beer might come to life, but in its present state I wouldn’t seek it out again."
""
""
""
"Overall - A very nice beer. A new holiday favorite of mine!!"
"Had this beer at the Brass Rail Deli in Cambelltown. Served in a tulip glass. Cool. Pours a nice fluffy white head and a roan color body. Smells of cherries Nice balance of fruit, grain, hop and yeast. Spritzy on the palate and refreshing. Some booze ending to the sip. I have to say that I had been avoiding this beer for awhile. I just didn't trust the beer given the number of beers who screw this beer up. I would go for this over and over again. Great beer."
""
"O: Warming alcohol, fruity, bready: like a fruitcake but actually tasty and welcome at the holidays"
""
""
""
"Glass = Pint Glass."
""
""
""
"Overall, worth the try. But a little too hard to enjoy with the rough finish."
""
"Heard about this one and had to give it a try. Pours our a bright red color and you can definitely taste a strong bite of cherry. Have always been a fan of mad elf. Nice strong beer with no bad aftertaste. Always willing to spend the extra buck to get it so I can casually have one now and then. Quality brew and not one you rapidly drink."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"nice seasonal brew and glad i tried it"
""
"Pours a ruby/copper color into my Delirium Tremens glass. The initial soda-like head dissipates very quickly leaving the tiniest ring of foam. Very intriguing aroma - has creamy, yeasty, funky & sweet tart elements to it. Sweet wild cherry dominates in the flavor. Interesting concoction in that it has a bit of a Pilsner mouthfeel that is a bit lacking in carbonation. Goes down very spicy and crisp, but it does not seem heavy at all. Later after the sip, a delayed warming sensation kicks in. Good, but there are much better Belgian Strong Dark Ales."
"M0-Fairly thin on the feel. This is a dangerous beer. So potent and so easy to drink. A great sipper and it will be a holiday regular."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, very drinkable strong brew, I like the light cherry flavors, I'm not sure if I'd like some of the flavors to come through stronger but it is tasty."
""
""
""
""
"I had a bottle of this at a restaurant recently. It arrived in a bottle and was poured into a goblet. The appearance was very dark and there was a little head when it poured. The smell was strong of spices and smoke. The taste was spicy and sweet, without a strong btter aftertaste. The mouthfeel was thick but smooth. Overall drinkability, not bad for a seasonal dark ale."
"Overall a nice beer, not exceptional but solid. Hides the 11% very well."
"T/M: sweet and spicy on the uptake. Flavors of honey and alcohol overwhelm the palate and drown out anything else. Medium carbonated with heavy body, almost syrupy. Too strong and phenolic for my tastes."
""
""
""
""
""
"O-its difficult to drink more than a pint of this. it hits quickly. the tastes just don't hold up well. you can tell its not brewed in belgium. too much heat, and artificial tasting flavors that don't mix well. honestly i think people get this because its a lower priced alternative to the belgian christmas beers, but just buy them instead. don't save your money by getting this instead."
""
""
"A different take on the style than most winter warmers and this relies on the cherries and yeast for flavor, rather than familiar warm spices. It would have been easy to go overboard with this one, but there is no hint of medicine or bad candy, something I was afraid of with the cherries. Definitely worth a try."
""
""
""
"O: Very interesting beer, almost too much going on that it strays so far from beer. Almost a wine like quality to this one. Great sipper and seasonal beer though just not my style."
""
""
""
""
"O - Troegs knows this beer is successful and the recipe doesn't deviate from year to year. I look forward to it every holiday season and try to keep it around the entire year. Definitely goes off the path for the style guidelines but the combination just simply works."
""
"O - An easy-to-drink brew with quite a kick. Decent but not great."
""
""
""
""
""
"A pretty good winter seasonal, albeit a strong one. I don't think I'd have more than one of these at a time, but I enjoy it enough to be glad that I bought a 6 pack."
""
"Merry Christmas!"
""
""
""
""
"O- A different take on a winter warmer. Not my favorite due to the cough syrup finish, but glad I finally got to try it."
""
""
"This was a very interesting experience. If this is on the shelf, I recommend picking up a bottle for something new."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A classic, especially out here in PA. Got more at home in the cellar."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This is delicious - a cacophony of subtle flavors that add to a very complex, yet dangerously drinkable, festive ale."
""
""
""
""
"Very easy to drink."
""
"I had this a few times last year, I've enjoyed it each time. Definitely an American-ish take on a Belgian but the intense dark fruit/sweetness/toastiness works out well here as a winter seasonal."
""
""
"Overall: Great seasonal from Troegs. I'll definitely seek this one out every holiday season both for taste and novelty. Definitely a conversation piece when broken out at holiday get-togethers, and with the 11% alcohol content it definitely helps to warm you up on even the coldest winter nights."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"After enjoying this stuff a bunch back in my NoVa days, I was stoked to get to try some more, thanks to my boy VDubb, who cracked some '07 and '08 bottles. This stuff pours a clear sunrise amber topped by a half-finger of relatively short-lived off-white foam. The nose comprises cherry, honey, fig, dates, caramel, light biscuit, and mandarin orange. The taste brings in more of the same, along with a pinch of black pepper and nutmeg. The body is a light-leaning medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a slick-ish feel. Overall, a rather enjoyable brew, one that doesn't overdo the spices and/or fruit, which many winter brews have a tendency to do. Good times."
""
"O - Well balanced, complex flavors, very interesting beer to try. I don't know that I would be able to drink too many, but the ABv isn't noticeable at all. Will definitely buy again."
"o-well i think im starting to finally get this beer. year after year i tried it and it turned me off completely. this was the first time on tap so it may have been the difference. its deep flavor and warming sensation bought on by the alcohol makes it a good fit for the cold holiday season."
""
"This beer pours a clear, ruby red with minimal head or lace. The aroma is of honey, vanilla, and dark cherries. The flavor is very well balanced with honey, cherry, and spice notes, particularly ginger. There's a pleasant malt sweetness with just a hint of hops. It's very smooth, warms nicely, and gets better as it warms. The mouthfeel is full. Troegs Mad Elf is an outstanding beer, a great way to wash down made from scratch chocolate chip cookies. Highly recommended!"
"O: I thoroughly enjoyed Troeg's Mad Elf and I believe it is well deserving of its acclaim. The cast of flavors work very well together and the beer makes for a great slow sipping experience in the winter months."
""
""
"O: I saw this beer on a ""must have holiday beer list," and I am surprised at how much i like it. The flavors are complex and balanced, if trending towards the sweet side of things, and the alcohol is nicely warming. A good beer."
"O: The year of age has helped this along nicely. It is definitely boozier fresh - and I can barely detect it at all in this bottle. If not for the warming, I'd never guess this was a double digit ABV offering. Definitely sweet, but not overly so. The cherries are an obvious addition here, but certainly aren;t overwhelming. A pretty solid example of a Belgian-style American Quad/Strong..."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, even if for fairly sentimental reasons, this is one of my favorite Christmas beers. I always look forward to getting Elf'd up. One of the prime features from the Brothers Trogner, and I dare say one of the best American Belgians overall."
"O: Not much of a head. Smells okay, but the mouthfeel is dry. Too much alcohol to enjoy this beer. I liked the Gouden Carolus Classic better."
"O: Wow – this beer was great! Definitely a sipper at 11% abv. It wallops quite an alcoholic punch but is easily drinkable."
"Medium bodied, it has enough carbonation to hustle it over your tongue pretty quickly. It doesn't coat very much, nor does it dry, but it does sting your tongue a little, seemingly a little from the carbonation and a little from the alcohol. A strong burn builds up in the back of the throat."
""
"Overall its a nice change of pace. It is a little sweet for my taste, and I'm not sure if I would pick this one up again. Maybe just a single."
""
"I like Troegs, just not sure that the Mad Elf is all it's cracked up to be. For such a strong beer, it leaves the palette unfulfilled and tastes a bit too much like cherry cough syrup. Average at best."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I'm glad I went with the 2010 because they had 2011 as well, very nicely done again Troegs."
""
""
""
""
""
"O-Very drinkable for the high alcohol content and good balance of flavors"
""
""
""
"Overall this is a good beer. The cherries mixed with the Belgian ale produce a nice, complex flavor profile that suits the winter season. The prominent alcohol detracts some from the balance, but overall a good beer."
""
""
"This is obviously a darker beer coming it at 11.0% alcohol percentage. Therefore you get your money's worth and don't have to drink a lot of them to get the job done. For people who enjoy pilsner's I wouldn't recommend this but for the heavy drinkers this is right up your ally. It pours a very dark color and leaves a potent aftertaste in your mouth, but I have no problem with it. When I'm looking for a dark beer to give me a little buzz and to go well with my meal I go with Mad Elf."
""
""
"Pours an amber cherry color with very little head and no lacing at all. Aroma of cherries, bananas and spicy Belgian yeast with alcohol in the back. Taste follows more sweetness and cherries. Smooth and silky mouthfeel. This is a tasty complex beer, I really like it!"
""
"O- good beer, different. basically a higher abv dubbel ale. Wish the cherries were a little more pronounced."
""
"A good one for sipping while decorating the tree."
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Sorry, I drainpoured about 1/3 of it. Not completely horrible but also extremely challenging to drink and be refreshed. Basically its a great tasting cough syrup..but unpleasant beer."
""
""
""
""
"I'll look forward to having 2-3 of these around the holidays every year."
"Pours a deep, brilliant, ruby red; clear, with essentially no head - which isn't too surprising. Any aroma is very subdued at first - just a barely detectable hint of malt and dark cherries and raisins. Seriously, how does this beer have almost no aroma? There is some flavor, at least. Malty and sweet but lacking any complexity. Hints of bread, raisin, cherry. A subtle, spicy yeast flavor tries to come out but is held back. There's flavor but not very much of it. Somehow the alcohol is very well hidden but I don't know how. Slight bitterness; full bodied but with a thin, watery mouthfeel. Maybe I'm doing it wrong but this beer lacks any character whatsoever. Alcoholic malt water."
""
""
""
"O: I love this one for the holidays. Not a bad price makes it a cute gift. Otherwise, high ABV makes it a 1-2 bottle drinkability and a nice take on the style."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall / Drinkability: Nice, and glad I tried, but not sure why this beer is all the rage. Maybe it's better when all the sediment stays behind (I do wish the brewer would warn you about bottle conditioned beers to pour slowly), but this is just okay. Smells good, tastes good, good color, but kind of unremarkable after that. Is indeed a warming beer though by the end of the glass with that higher ABV, so for the winter holidays, good for warming you up, but beyond that, I don't think I'll go out of my way to purchase again, but if offered, I would certainly drink it."
"Poured from a bomber into a 10 oz. snifter. This pours a brilliant ruby color that is nearly transparent. You can see clean through one side of the glass, the beer, and out the other. Pours with the faintest of heads and disappears quickly. The nose is extremely fruity...very winey. The cherries and honey meld together to give this the nose of a mead. It's a lovely scent nonetheless. Were I blindfolded, however, I'd have said this was wine or mead with the quickness. The taste is very sweet, with a shade of tartness to it. The honey and malt tail in at the back end of a taste. This has a very nice mouthfeel to it. Not too heavy, not too thin. It's got a wonderful finish too. Overall, this is a nice, easy drinker that at 11.0%, could very likely catch up to you fast. It doesn't come across nearly as boozy as the ABV suggests it should be. Great seasonal beer."
"D and O: Very drinkable for the ABV, I will give it that. It's a really solid beer."
""
""
""
"It's complex, yet not the most complex thing ever. Palate pleasing, a little dangerous with its high ABV, but hey, the elf on the label seems to be having a good time. I wouldn't drink a ton of it, but it's a nice break from my usual selection. Cheers."
""
""
"O: Very tasty Belgian Strong Dark ale and my favorite beer yet from Troegs. I may have to get some more of these to throw in the cellar for next year and compare a few years."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is not a beer I want every day, but in the winter warmer category, this is absolutely one of my favorites. The perfect beer for a cold, snowy night."
"Very disappointing brew from an excellent brewery - not what I expected from Troegs."
""
"This is almost a very tasty beer. I'd say it has most of the elements of a very tasty beer. But the alcohol brings a pronounced sharp bitterness, which I find quite unpleasant. Okay, the ABV is high, but it's not well-hidden at all. And it's not like a pleasant kick, but rather a grinding, grating scrape of the mouth. Boo."
"Overall: Probably my new favorite winter drink, the alcohol content warms you up nice, and take note that in my opinion, this is a sipper. If you're in PA for the winter be sure to pick this up for yourself!"
"I haven't seen a beer with a color quite like this. It's lika a dark, hazy rose wine color. After a very aggressive pour, the white foam quickly dissipates leaving no cap or lacings. Aromas are amazing, particularly if you let this warm a bit. A solid sweet malt and belgian yeast backbone with tart cherries and hints of spice and booze. Smooth and syrupy feel with light carbonation. Sweet malt and sugar flavors from beginning to end with tart cherry flavors through the middle that transition to spice and then boozy heat at the finish. Finishes semi-dry at first but very dry over the long haul . Most definitely a sipper. The aggressive pour is a must if sampling from a bottle. Plus, don't drink this too cold. All aspects of this beer improve if you allow it to warm up a bit."
""
"O: The lack of carbonation and any distinguishing characteristic makes this one of the weaker examples of a bomber one can buy. Bottle 2011."

"A beer I've been psyched to try for a while and finally got around to trying it. Bought a bomber of this for about $6. Pours an orange/red color, alcohol and cherry smell to it. Taste is complex and dangerously tasty. Medium bodied, great mouthfeel. The honey and cherry flavors really shine through, and the beer remains well balanced throughout. Being 11% ABV, the alcohol has a presence so this is a sipper for sure. A pleasure to drink, tons of complexity and tastiness to get through... will most likely be buying a few more of these before the winter season is through."

"O: ABV is hidden well; highly drinkable for the booze content. A great American holiday adaptation of a Belgian style. I always come back to this one year after year."

"Its a good brew, not amazing but I do like the belgian notes. Easy drink for 11% ABV, but I just dont get the hype...maybe its the cool glass in the gift box..."
""
"I bought a case of this so I plan on sitting on this for at least a year."
"O: I like this beer a lot. If you like beers with high alcohol content and high malt:hop ratios, then this beer is for you."
""
""
""
"O: Not sure why so many people actually enjoy this beer. Oh well, to each there own. Much better holiday seasonals out there."
""
""
"O: Definitely disappointed. This is a beer I've heard a lot about and was excited for. Oh well. I have five more that I'll age for a bit and we'll see what happens. Expectations are low."
""
""
""
""
"O/D-Pretty good. I think its far too pricey at nearly $16 for a six pack. I only bought a single beer so I am not unhappy with my purchase. Good to try, won't be shelling out that much doe for a whole six pack any time soon however."
""
""
""
""
"Not a fan of this one when fresh. Really loving it with age. Buy a six pack, drink one. If you don't like it, sit on it for a year or two. Thank me later."
"O: An impressive holiday offering that teeters on the obscene. Definitely for the more acquired beer aficionados. This bastard is heavy, racy, and tough with a 11% blast cap!"

"O: Great winter warmer Belgian beer, sweet and silky smooth, one of my favorites of the year"
"O: I'm not really sure why this is a Christmas beer, but it's good either way. The 11% is hidden very well, and the addition of the cherries makes this seem like a kriek mixed with a BSPA. Very interesting, so try it if you haven't yet"

"O: Very good Belgian. One of the best if not the best I've had (which is not many)."
""
"I would definitely buy this one again."
"O-Overall this a very different and of the most interesting winter seasonals I have ever had. Real complex smells and flavors going on here. I will definitely look to this again during the winter months."
""
"O- Really nice. I've always liked this seasonal. Probably not something I'd buy year round, but I do get my share when winter approaches. Wish it had more carbonation, more REAL cherry depth, and hid the alcohol just a bit more."

"This beer ended up being a lot different than I thought it would be but in a good way. Big and full in body but not syrupy like I imagined."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, well-made like all Troeg, but is held back from being great by a tough, murky finish."
""
""
"Poured from a 12oz bottle. Enjoyed at home with studying for the BJCP exam. Great appearance, a nice Cherry/Amber color. The nose smelled of honey and cherries, with a slight hint of a clear alcohol scent. The taste is balanced and smooth, with robust fruit and honey flavors."

"Overall: Very well balanced! Couldn't tell it is 11% ABV. As it warmed up the alcohol was present but still very tastey. A great winter brew. Cheers!"
"Nice beer."
"They both have a medium body and good carbonation. The 08 in my opinion is leaps and bounds better then the 11, if I get anymore bottles this year I will be putting them away for awhile."
"D - One of the only beers I've ever tried that is just unmistakably elite. And one of the only beers I've ever encountered where a brewery just set out to make it great. It doesn't fit any real description nor style. Troegs just set out to make a great, elite beer, and they have with Mad Elf, they absolutely have. Try this if you haven't, and you'll understand what I mean."
") - A perfect choice to be enjoyed after a big winter meal. One of my favorite winter beers."
"O-a holiday ale with good flavor and balance"
"All in all Mad Elf is a very good beer and I would highly recommend anyone to give it a try around the holidays. Its around $16 a six pack but if you can find a single bottle its a must buy."
"Testing the beer this flavors are confirmed in order. First the cherry fruit flavor, being met by malt and honey notes, than some decent hops and spice to finish the beer. Good balance and very drinkable. The alcohol is noticeable, but well hidden! Great Winterbeer!"
"90."
"O - exceptional brew. Might need to grab another...11%? really?"
"O: The booze is apparent but it's not too overpowering. Very sweet and sugary. Really showcases the Belgian yeast strain and candy sugars. Honey and cherry just make an appearance in the background."
"Cheers,"
"CHEERS"
"Overall – A decent Belgian strong ale. It kind of reminds me of Three Philosophers (but sadly not quite as good). A solid beer, and one that is keeping me nice and warm on this chilly night."
"Overall not too bad, nothing real crazy that I am getting excited about though either. For eleven percent abv, it doesn't feel like a boozy mess or hard to drink, which is a nice surprise. However, I am not finding myself really drawn to this."
"The beer seems more like a digestif, very comforting and warming post dinner to substitute a port wine. The sweetness would work well with dessert. A fine beer as a great winter warmer."
"This seems to be one of the most accessible Holiday beers because it's sweet and high in alcohol. A bit too syrupy for me."
"Overall - This is a very well rendered beer, it is missing some of the ""funk"" from a belgian style dark but i dont think this is intended to be like that. This tastes more like an over sweetened quad but an incredibly delicious beer for sure."
"Cheers."
"Overall: I picked up a six pack and enjoyed the first couple, I was going to see how the rest age, but I am going to buy another case because it will disappear and I know I will drink it for the holidays."
"O: This is definitely a great Belgian-style ale, and perfect for the holiday's. However, I was expecting the honey and cherry flavors to stand out more, since they were advertised on the bottle. Unfortunately, they were quite subtle. Not something I would buy again, but definitely worth trying!"
"Poured a 12 oz. Bottle into a snifter. It pours a beautiful transparent ruby liquid with 1/2"" head that quickly disappears. Smells of spice; clove is what I’m getting with some peppery accent. Tastes of sweet fruits. Clove, fig, and cherry. The cherry was not as pronounced as I imagined it. The honey adds another layer of complexity. Very smooth for 11%. Mildly carbonated and medium bodied. This is definitely a cold weather beer. After 6 oz. I can feel the warming effects."
"Overall: I love this beer and time brings out the better qualities. More cherries and more honey, less yeast spice and less bubblegum. A very fantastic experience. I still have 3 or 4 left in the cellar and I am gonna see what happens over the next few years."
"O: A decent beer, but it's a bit overhyped. I don't think it deserves the huge hype it gets, with stores being very sneaky hiding it and such, but it's a good beer. I don't think I would buy this again though, it's not balanced enough, too much of a booze flavor."
"DELICIOUS, WORTH GETTING!"
"Would have to be in the mood for this one as it is pretty sweet and a little boozy. But the two flavors work well together and make for a good holiday after-dinner sipper."
"O- Very interesting beer. Very drinkable for an 11% beer. The complexity is unique and I am sure would change even more with some age."
"Overall: This is a great seasonal beer, with a great, unique taste. If you are a fan of Belgians, this is a great change of pace. high in alcohol, you shouldn't (couldn't) drink more than 2 of these easily, but this is a terrific Christmas beer."
"O. Great on a cold fall or winter day, but not an everyday drinker or something I crave too often but still a nice holiday treat to have around."
"Cheers."
"Pours an amber color w/ a reddish tint when held to the light. Not much in the way of carbonation or lacing, but w/ the high 11% ABV, I won't ding it too much. Somewhat clear in appearance. Nose is that of mainly cherry, honey, and some alcohol. Not as complex as the best in style- a little one dimensional for me. Taste is the same- it's not bad.. but up against the best in style, it's lacking complexity and taste. This is a tough style list though, so it's really not bad. Feel is on the lighter side, w/ a nice sweet honey aftertaste. Overall, this is a good beer, it's just missing more yeast, malt, and complexity in the taste/feel. I like the idea of it though. Cheers."
"Overall: This is probably my favorite Christmas seasonal around (although it seems pretty early to have this coming out in mid-October). A nice departure from the typical spiced holiday offering."
"O: I don't think that I would recommend this ale. It is ridiculously overhyped and overpriced. There are far better and far more authentic Belgian strong dark ales on the market."
"O - The Mad Elf is a delightful seasonal take on a Belgian-style beer. It is sweet and boozy, so it's not a beer to take lightly. If you like sweet beers, give this one a try."
"O-Brings back fond memories of Pennsylvania."
"O- The Alcohol is not hidden at all, it's borderline too sweet and just not my thing. Perhaps time will help mellow the alcohol but I'd have to experiment before a re-review."
"Overall is great! Looking forward to getting more of this and more Troegs stuff."
"Pours amber with just a slight head. Smells of sour cherries and sweet malt with some oak tannins on the back end. Tastes quite tannic with a lip puckering bitterness that carries through to the finish when more sour cherries kick in and help balance the tannins. Not quite what I was expecting, but unusual enough to be enjoyable and interesting."
"I like this beer, very appropriate holiday beer. The flavors work well together creating an interesting interpretation of a belgian style beer. Mad Elf is a little boozey but not to the point of being off putting. I would like to drink this again, preferably when there is snow on the ground."
"Pours a clear ruby colored red with soapy-like head that fades down to nothing. Smells of cherries with some hot alcohol burn. The alcohol notes increase as it warms. Tastes of cherries dipped in syrupy chocolate. Some brown sugar notes and a tad of spicy notes likely from the yeast. I get the honey a little bit. Tastes surprisingly light bodied. Rather even balanced in bitterness. Nice on a winter night."
"O - the ABV and heavy cherry presence reduce drinkability a bit, but still rather easy drinking. I saw someone taking down a 6-pack of this at the MSU-PSU football game last fall, which I definitely don't recommend, but I would have this again."
"I like the flavors, but there is too much sugar on the finish. I feel like I just ate a donut or something. That really holds me back from giving this a better review."
"I have Mad Elf more on tap these days than in bottles, and the profile is similar, though perhaps they've mellowed out a bit with the recipe so that the taste isn't completely overwhelming. Pours--typically into a stem glass--copper-brown with reddish-orange hues that become more visible in the light. Typically, as with the bottle, an off-white head that retains and laces well, and perhaps is more pronounced when being served on tap. Nose of fruitcake, cherries, honey, dark malts, raisins, and cloves. Some alcohol notable. The taste follows the smell almost to a ""t," with complex flavors of dark caramel malts, honey and brown sugar, cherries and raisins, and subtle spice. Some alcohol burn. Medium bodied, full-flavored, and highly desirable. I give it points off overall, because despite the fact that I do like it, it is one of the most inconsistent beers year to year as far as flavor goes."
"Quite simply my favorite beer on earth. I used to look forward to Santa showing up for christmas, now i look forward to the Mad Elf's arrival. Santa used to bring me chocolate covered cherries, now I get to drink a liquid form of the sweet treat with alcohol added."
"O: Respectable, but not great. I'd consider buying it again if the price was right."
"D - This is one of those ""one and done"" brews, pretty much just because of the ABV. It is quite tasty though and a great example of the style. Certainly worth a try, I would recommend it to my friends."
"D: Pretty good. Not my personal taste, but a well brewed ale nonetheless. A decent Christmas-time ale."
"O - That thick mouthfeel combined with the sweetness and metallic taste did not make for an enjoyable beer. I really enjoy most beers from Troegs, but not this one."
"O: All in all, this is a very solid beer. I was surprised since fruit beers are hard to make and make well. This has a faint cherry, but just enough to add a nice accent. Try if you like sweet, boozy beers where the booze is well hidden."
"This is a delicious seasonal ale! A dark, cherry colored and fragrant ale worthy of the higher price tag. I bought this in a 6-pack (which is much more economical than the large bottle sold) and really enjoyed it's fruity, rich and slightly sweet flavor. This beer is a thicker style and is best enjoyed chilled in a thin baloon style wine glass to be sipped, savored and enjoyed! A treat indeed!"
"O - This is one of my top three Christmas beers. I don't think it stands up as well as I would like it to with a few months of age on it."
"Overall I am really unimpressed with this brew. I had heard great things but... Yeah one and done on this brew for me. No taste complexity, weak smell, and I just can't get what the big deal is about this brew. Pass."
"Notes: This is a big beer and it lets you know it."
"A nice change of pace brew for those who are burned out on the usual hops vs. malt fare, but it can be improved a bit by bringing out the flavors better."
"The mad elf, it pours out as a rich caramel color with pretty nice tan head on it. The aromas are spicy and most definitely Belgian. There might even be some Christmas berries in there too. The taste reminded me of a sweet cherry jelly mixed with a lot of alcohol and some spices to give it some tingle in the aftertaste. This is an enjoyable beer for the winter season, it's a heavier mouthfeel too. The ABV will keep ya warm when you out shoveling snow as well."
"Poured a decent amount of head that disciPated quickly. Ruby red semi cloudy color and zero lacing in my snifter. Aromas of spicy Belgian yeast clove spice banana and cherry. Some phenol is present as well. As it warms the flavors intensify and have a nice blend of sweet spicy and bright fruit. I'm sertainly loving the Belgian strain in this beer it compliments the maltiness very well. Strong alcohol follows a great balance of sweet spice and everything nice. Velvety mouthfeel makes this aa great session ale. I will be having this again"
"O: Its good, just not my favorite. I don't have a problem with the slight alcohol presence, just not really for me."
"D - For an 11% abv beer, this stays remarkably drinkable. The flavors are really nice and balanced and work very well together. The sweet cherry flavor is really excellent."
"well this one was a different one for me. I was expecting a lot of bubbles. and carbonation. with as sweet as it is this is a delightful ale. I would expect more from troegs personally, but non the less it was enjoyable."
"O- This beer is a great wintertime drinker. The ABV is huge on this making it a little more like a sipper than a drinker. I could have a couple but the overall flavors would kill your palate for the rest of the night."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass. Color was a darker amber orange that was nicely translucent. Head was very thin, slighty off white that left a small ring around the top. Aroma was sweet, slightly licorice hints. Taste was slightly sweet, hints of fruit, and a tad of spicy vanilla. Felt good in the mouth, was just slightly sticky so it coated well, and just a tad of carbonation. Pleasant to drink. Hid the ABV extremely well."
"A cult classic among, beer geeks in the know. From the label to the ingredients it screams Christmas. Crystal-clear red color garners a thin white lacing. Yeasty phenols to cherries to ripe fruit to spice, an amazing nose. Creamy mouthfeel with a bit of crispness to lift the full body. Alcohol chimes in first with lots of warmth, spice and rose water. Cherry juice, candied fruit and faint medicinal flavors hit the middle with a small tartness within. Spice picks up middle to end, making way for the alcohol to really warm. Sweet, spicy finish. This is one of those slow- sipping nightcap brews--after a long day of holiday bustling, you'll probably need one of these."
"This is a very nice beer to drink slowly and enjoy. I would caution enjoying more than two in one sitting."
"Found at the Wild Horse in Beverly, MA this one's a brilliant light mohogany, reddish-copper color with a fair whispy white head and good lace. The aroma brings a eucalyptus cherry caramel malt. Very pleasant. The flavor follows suit with clove and fruit nougat and a subtle lemony hop front. It carrys a thin maltiness with some granny apple hints and yeast overtones. I think this comes off better on tap than it did from the bottle. The cherry backbone seems a bit deeper. Carbonation is kind of fine. It's medium bodied with a slightly syrupy feel. Drinkability is modest, there's a mild alcohol presence. Overall, a nice change up choice on tap, well done with a bit of an edge."
"D: Even when aware of 11% abv this is sneakily potent. With the sweet and booze this does have a bit of a malt liquor aspect. Still the alcohols are not harsh at all, and I wonder how this would age. Fresh it is a bit thick and sweet, and some how the flavors do nor really meld. Fruity, sweet, florally pungent, yeasty, and boozy. If you sipped a few of these waiting up for Santa you would never stay awake long enough to know for sure."
"A friend bought me a sixer for Christmas this year. I've had a couple and think I will hold on to the rest to see what some time does to them."
"D: Many of my friends love this beer, but it's just not a personal favorite of mine. I don't hate it, but I certainly don't crave it."
"Overall, a pretty decent beer. There are better American takes on the style, but there are definitely worse as well."
"Complex and maddening. Definitely a Belgian ale."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, medium carbonation, and a bit sticky, yet still refreshing."
"Pours a surprisingly transparent ruby with a fingers worth of white head that leaves decent lacing. I smell some oxidation right away, followed by some yeast, slight fruit and malts. The first thing I taste is oxidation, immediately followed by cherries, and a lot of sweet malts. I think the oxidation is a bit much, more than the last time I had this beer, for sure. Mouthfeel is sticky with medium carb, probably on the low end. Drinkability is good, especially for the ABV. A good beer that I've enjoyed in the past a little more than this one, but still solid."
"This beer really took me by surprise. I wasn't sure what I thought of it, but after I tasted it I was hooked. the beer pours an amber color with a white head about 1 finger tall. Head doesn't last long and there is no lacing, but that cones with the territory of 11% ABV beers. Smell is of honey and cherries. If it didn't say honey and cherries on the label I would have described it as a sweet malt and dark fruit smell. Taste starts sweet then finishes with slight honey taste, there are sweet malts throughout. Thickness is about right, no carbonation though (comes with the 11% territory). Overall, despite the 11% ABV I really dig this beer. I got this in a trade with slvrmon82 and will definitely have to send him some more quality beers in order to get some more of this. I honestly would not have suspected this to be 11%, I could taste a little bit of alcohol, but it wasn't strong."
"A nice red tinted looking beer with little head. It smells of cherry and honey. Tastes of honey and also cherries, very sweet. Loads of alcohol flavor a alcohol %. Can put down a few due to it being very drinkable. An enjoyable beer for the holiday season. Also, is better when aged for a long period of time."
"D - It is an okay beer, just the sweetness and alcohol dominate the palate too much."
"D-very drinkable. Especially for abv."
"D. I'm not a big fan of spiced ales and this is no exception."
"Pours amber red with a decent amount of head that dissipates quickly. Smells really strongly of cherries and spice. Honestly... Doesn't smell that good. Tastes spicy and a bit tart/sour. Its got a lot of yeasty tastes to it too... It has a solid mouthfeel and is fairly drinkable but it doesn't really do that much for me."
"Which leads to a similar flavor - it essentially comes off as a flavored beer, without the depth of Three Philosophers, which is the closest comparison I can think of. The body is too thin for the style and there seems to the raisin/chocolate sweetness you like to see in a strong dark. Overall this is a decent dessert beer, but not much else."
"appearance is the same. aroma and taste is not as cloyingly sweet. Body seems to have thinned a bit, as I don't have the same ""syrupy"" complaint. Overall, an improvement."
"D: This is unlike anything else I've had from Troegs: intolerable. I had a hard time finishing this one."
"Drinability is ok. At 11% ABV a 12oz bottle is enough. However, even if I was to move on to another one it would be something else."
"Mouthfeel has a bite of alchahol and spice, not something I could sit and drink all evening but a very tasty brew indeed."
"Poured from 12 oz bottle into dimpled mug. Pours a flat amber with a fizzy white head, which diminishes fairly steadily. Has a good aroma of cherry and malts with a touch of hoppiness. Has a medium body with a slick texture. Has a lively carbonation. A good duration with a slightly metalic chalky finish. This brew hides the 11% very well. Has hints of a Belguim."
"Notes: Pretty decent. A tad one-dimensional though. The Belgian yeast seems to be under-utilized, and the cherries hog too much of the spotlight."
"Drinkability: Admittedly, this is one of my favorite Christmas beers. It has held up well to a year in the cellar. Good beer for a cold night and I'll keep coming back to this one."
"I had a bottle last night for the first time, my initial glance at the bottle as i poured it into a glass was the ABV of 11%. I was surprised to see that a christmas ale would be this high. But the taste and drinkability, did not hint at the level of high alcohol. The taste gave a cherry flavor upfront and finished smooth like a good ale does. A very unique flavor unlike other cherry beers I've tasted, and would conclude that i hope to find some around town before the season ends."
"D- never again this was a really bad expierence didn't even finish it."
"D- Overall a good holiday beer. Definitely good to drink during the cold months. Not overwhelming with the alcohol and not too sweet for my palate. Would definitely get again."
"D - The alcohol was hidden very well, but the sweetness got to me a bit more than I would have liked."
"D: a solid wintertime brew that I look forward to every year. definitely worth a look."
"M - Light bodied yet syrupy."
"D - could have about 3 on a good day, but otherwise, not so much."
"Poured into a tulip. Thanks Andy for sharing your Christmas gift from me! Poured into a tulip. The beer pours a dark cranberry color with about an inch of white head that vanishes almost immediately. The body is clear and transparent. The aroma is full of dark cherries and malt. It kind of has a medicinal aroma to it also. Again, cherry flavor right up front. It kind of rounds out with vanilla and oak. Again though, it's kind of medicinal; like a cherry cough drop. The feel is fair. It's kind of dry. It seems to have tannins like a red wine. It's drinks fair, I'm glad I've tried it, but I probably won't grab this unique beer again."
"Mouthfeel is average. This is an okay sipper. Very unique, but nothing I'd go out of my way to have again."
"The color is a crystal clear ruby/burnt orange. I believe the head was off-white, but to be honest, it didn't last long enough for me to get a real good look. Smells sweet and boozy. Cherries are predominant, but a bit complex in that maraschino cherries are discernable as well as dried black cherries. Banana, vanilla, and alcohol round things out. Taste is very reflective of the aroma, although the vanilla note seems replaced by a touch of bitter chocolate and honey. Otherwise cherries are dominant. Alcohol is far more present in the nose than on the palate. The finish is somewhat reminiscent of a cherry cough syrup, but finishes much cleaner than one would suspect. Feel is slightly viscous and resiny. Incredibly easy to drink."
"Overall, a below average beer, but pleasant enough. I don't think I'd seek this out again."
"Very tasty, but I'm satisfied with one bottle-I wouldn't want to drink a ton of this. Haven't had very much from Troegs, but I'm glad I got a chance to try this while I was out on the east coast."
"D: Great beer! Good beer for a nice cold night. 1 or 2 of these will have you feeling good & warm. The most I've ever had at one sitting was 4 and my stomach was paying for it the next day. Glad it's only Seasonal or I would need an annual liver transplant."
"Drinkability was below average because all I could think about was cough syrup. I'd heard a lot about this one and was looking forward to trying it for the first time, but it certainly didn't live up to the hype. Definitely a disappointment in my book."
"Drinkability - A good holiday beer that is a nice change from the strong, bitter malts found in a lot of dark wintertime lagers. Overall a pretty good beer especially considering the high alcohol content."
"Overall - my favorite holiday ale. definitely worth the hype"
"Pours a nice reddish brown with a solid, crackling head and some lace. In the nose, caramel malts, cherries and brown sugar sweetness. In the taste, belgian yeast, honey, and soft cherry. Almost tastes like a quad with more fruit notes. Medium bodied, easy and fun to drink. Still one of my favorite seasonals."
"This is a very unique and enjoyable brew, though I would recommend only one bottle per sitting, as the sweetness may become a bit much when downing mutiple bottles."
"D= Very good beer but it sneaks up on you with a 11% ABV I probably wouldn't want to drink more than a double deuce."
"Its not my favorite beer, or even my favorite Troegs offering, but I really look forward to this in the winter months and during the holiday season. I do prefer this with about 12 months on it, and always lay down a sixer and a few bombers each year, so perhaps ill add some notes when I drink something with some age on it."
"D- One thing I've always said about Mad Elf and what it should be known for is how well the 11% is masked. For something that high you'd think this is 5 or 6%, no exaggeration. This beer is kind of special to me because this was actually the first craft beer case I ever bought to myself a little over a year ago. Back then I thought it was the best beer ever, and now of course my palatte has changed tremendously. Still I'll always look forward to Mad Elf releases. Another good seasonal release from Troegs."
"Again, I won't be paying for this again. There's been an increasingly large influx of new Christmas beers every year, and that coupled with the old staples that always wow will ensure that I always have many better options for my seasonal fix. The one bump I do give to drinkability is that the 11% abv was very well hidden considering."
"Still, a tasty beer - just maybe a bit too boozy - I would try it again though."
"d: drinks pretty smoothly for strong ale. i'll seek it out again next winter."
"Overall this is a miss for me, too alcoholic, unpleasant and even ended up being a drainpour. Will not revisit ever again, even for free."
"D - I usually don't like Winter Warmers. It's just not my favorite style but I think this is pretty drinkable."
"D: Very drinkable for 11% and tastes great. Good winter beer and might do well with some age. However, this one is great right away so I would pick some up if you can."
"D - Very drinkable. Spice profile isn't overwhelming and there's enough flavor to keep you coming back."
"D- A bit of a sipper, but it is very enjoyable and the alcohol is well hidden. Worthy of its legendary reputation."
"A friend of a friend commented that the Mad Elf was a ""big beer"" which was very true. This Christmas Belgian Ale was had a spicy aroma and really smelled both spicy and sweet at the same time. I wouldn't say this was one of my favorite beers, but it was a good seasonal beer and worth checking out in my book."
"nothing extra special about this beer. its very much got a holiday flavor to it though. i bought one for christmas and i will do the same next year, but no more than one for me."
"I LOVE Troegs but this is one of those beers that never does it for me. I usually have one or two a year just to see how the batch came out and I really should try aging some. I might have better results. Good beer, just not for me for 12% it drinks dangerously smooth."
"Big thanks to bs870621345 for this one as a part of a thanks box! Serve from bottle into a Delirium Tremens snifter. Poured a brilliant red-orange with a one finger off-white head to a half finger slowly. Maintained excellent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma is comprised of sweet malt, honey, cherries, bananas, and alcohol. The flavor was of sweet malt, banana, honey, slight cherries, and very subtle alcohol. It had a light feel on the palate with low-mild carbonation. Overall this was a pretty excellent brew. I can't believe this thing is 11%! Excellent aroma and nice flavor that was balanced quite nicely. Definitely a nice fruit aspect going on here to mask the alcohol. This is a must try without a doubt."
"D: Just a sweet boozy brew right now. I'm not a fan of this fresh. I've heard it ages well so glad to have a few in the cellar"
"D: A nice, spiced strong Belgian ale for the holidays. Very clean, smooth and spicy flavors blend nicely with the hints of honey and cherry. The seemingly subdued alcohol also makes it a dangerous brew, as noted earlier because of the ABV. It might be a bit much to handle all day, but after dinner, it's a nice treat."
"this fresh growler is certainly more evenly balanced than the bottled version, yum - drinkability is real good, even though i should know better..."
"pours with no carb, hazy ruby with bubbles rising. malty, thick sugar sweetness with a brilliant touch of cherries and some spiciness. the cherries don't really come off in the nose but in the flavor they are subtle and perfectly in balance with the heavy malt notes. love the choice of yeast here. some strong phenols. overall, pretty damn good, beautiful mouthfeel and fairly drinkable."
"Drinkability-too strong for me to even finish this bomber."
"D - Definitely a sipper, but an excellent one. One of the beers I look forward to every year, Christmas isn't the same without it."
"The drink is ok, but booze affects it's sessionability."
"Pours a copper color with a thin cap of head that fades quickly to a ring. The cherries are really pronounced in the aroma, reminding me of cough syrup. There's also some medicinal notes along with hints of sweet, toasted malt. Thick, syrupy and sticky sweet, this beer is creamy and full bodied. Some mild bitterness comes through on the back end to help cut some of the sweetness. The finish is actually fairly fast and astringent, with some hot alcohol showing up. Drinkability is good for such a big, sweet beer. A tasty one, but given its price it's kinda hard to justify more than one."
"The mouthfeel isn't overly viscous and the carbonation is higher than expected given the lack of head. Overall I like this and will look forward to it again next year."
"SkÅL!"
"D - A delicious winter warmer to be savored and enjoyed. The alcohol is nicely hidden behind the malts, sugars, and fruits, but there to make it drink more like a brandy than a beer. I would have opened a second bomber had I bought one."
"Conclusion: a great seasonal, winter beer. Mad Elf= holiday time"
"I really think this beer is a great addition to the holiday season. It's so flavorful and complex. Pick it up you won't be disappointed!"
"Overall a good holiday beer but not a great version of a Belgian strong dark ale. Taken at face value though, I enjoy it as a nice slow sipper."
"This is my Christmas beer for the year. I will be enjoying this beer in my snifter by the fire while watching the snow fly."
"Mad Elf is medium-bodied and smooth, with minimal carbonation. Even at 11%, the alcohol is just barely noticeable, making for a nicely drinkable beer."
"D- Wasn't sure what to expect with this beer. Not bad for something different. Could have done with less cherry flavor, but still a pretty easy to drink beer. Still love trying beers that are different."
"For such a strong beer, it is very drinkable. A great holiday beer to share with friends or consume by yourself. I have had this on the shelf for a bit and will be sure to buy more this season before it is gone."
"4.5 D: Damn tasty beer. Troegs seems like they can do no wrong. Every beer they put out (well, almost every beer) is about as good as it gets. Way too easy going down for an 11% beer."
"Overall, the best thing about this brew was the aroma. While it was quite sweet smelling, the contributory components remained complex. There was also a nice and rich maltiness that helped to smooth the drink along. In the end, this mad elf certainly brings happy holidays!!"
"Drinkability is good. Given the 11%, you probably don't want to drink more than one in a sitting, but what a pleasant sitting it will be. A well crafted and thoroughly enjoyable holiday beer."
"Mouthfeel was a little thicker than I prefer or expected, but good for the style. I appreciated that it wasn't sticky and very little alcohol burn. I couldn't believe that the beer was 11% when I checked BA on my phone as I finished the beer. I could easily see ordering a 2nd, but I hadn't eaten yet!"
"Overall, a very, very good beer to drink around Christmas. Its a solid Belgian Dark Strong but really stands out as a Christmas beer. I think the B+ rating this has is a bit on the underrated side. This is easily my favorite beer I've had from the Troegs Brothers. Try and get this one if you can! Cheers!"
"This is a beer that I like less and less with each passing year. I figured an older model would develop some flavor, but it just seems like a fresh model without the boozy kick. Frankly, this is a huge disappointment."
"D- this is the winter brew to go to. Troegs really crafted a christmas brew that will impress everyone who has an open mind to craft beer. You really can drink this because the flavor hides the 11%. What a brew!"
"12/17/11 Side note: Had a side-by-side tasting with a fresh bottle and one aged a year in my cellar. Wow. What a difference a year makes. The booziness is all but gone and the cherry flavor really stands out. Great beer fresh and even better with some age on it."
"dangerously drinkable for an 11% (aka great for the holidays)"
"-Bye"
"Cheers."
"Pours a very beautiful golden mahogany that leaves a little less that a 1 inch white head. Doesnt leave much lacing. All i get in the nose is a lot of alcohol and some berry fruity sweetness. The taste however, is more strong of berry than alcohol, although both of which are very noticeable. There is also a small presence of malt sweetness. Good mouthfeel. average mouthfeel. Very good drinkablilty for an 11% alcohol beer. Probably gonna buy this again, and if your wondering if you should buy it, you definitely should give it a shot."
"D-the high abv and sweetness cut down on the drinkability, but its still a good one to try"
"D - I find the alcohol to be pretty apparent here. This is definitely a sipper, even with a year of age on it. Just one would be enough for me."
"D: Too funky in the nose and on the tongue."
"Drinkable - hell yeah but not something I would seek out regularly."
"A welcomed winter brew that I look forward to each year. Brings in the cold weather with a tingling warmth. Always a fun time with this beer. Thanks Troegs."
"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a 12oz glass. Wonderful dark red color, but almost no carbonation and almost no head. That may be the biggest downfall. The taste is overpowering, not really a bad thing, but very intense. Lots of cloves, and very festive. Almost no head halfway through. It's extremely high alcohol content is fairly obvious. Overall pretty darn good, but I am only man enough for one!"
"D: very tasty and easy to drink but not sessionable due to the high ABV. Two of these and I was quite buzzed."
"D: Too alcoholly, and not enough complexity to dig in, but is a great winter warmer. At 11%, must be enjoyed in moderation - 12oz had me reeling."
"Medium ruby color with medium brown highlights. No head, light tan ring around edge of glass. Aroma is spicey but everything blends very well together, pick out the clove and some very faint cinnamon/cardamom but not getting too much of the cherries. Mild carbonation. Definitely on the sweeter side. Alcohol present on the end to finish. Spices are present in flavor but not overpowering. End is a little thick, but not too heavy. Alcohol becomes more present with warmth. Not the most drinkable Christmas ale, but still good."
"D - I struggled to finish the growler myself so get some help damn it! Taking a whopping 3 1/2 hours to get the whole thing down by the 4th it actually felt like the night before Christmas and Santa was waiting for me with gifts, to describe the giddiness was the true definition of a winter warmer. Enjoy this with friends and family!"
"I like this beer a lot, surpasses Great Lakes Christmas in my book for sure. A dark red brown color with smallish head on it. Nose is sweet malt, some fruitiness (cherries?), some nice spicing to it too. Very holiday, honestly. Flavor follows with some of the same notes, almost fruit-cake-y overall if you up the spicing (cinnamon, nutmeg, and others)--very good. Very smooth and an easy drink. Nice beer, one that I will be getting again."
"medium bodied mouthfeel, average carbonation; feels nice in the mouth... drinks dangerously well for an 11 perenter."
"Not a bad beer at all, although probably one that I wouldn't drink all that often. I would love to pick up a few bottles and see how they taste with a few years age."
"D - Fairly high. I loved this one but after having so many beers already this was the final straw, I had to leave after this one. I have had normal mad elf, splinter red aka BA mad elf, and yet this was the best mad elf I have ever had. The balance was great but the ABV is so high you just can't have more than one."
"D - more of a tradition around here than anything else. this beer with a year or more on it though, and thats good stuff. fresh, its unabashed and wild, and not subtle at all. great if you like lightly alcoholic cherries, otherwise, dont expect a whole lot."
"I'm torn on the drinkability... it depends on your definition. Certainly can't session this thing; I had a bit of a buzz on after a single 12oz bottle. But it's a totally perfect sipper for a quiet winter night, and it'll warm you up fast."
"M/D - The sugary sweetness makes it a little hard to drink, but that may not be a bad thing in such an alcoholic beer. Definitely worth a try!"
"Chad"
"I want to start off by saying that I dig this, but it is the equivalent of a very rich meal. Only so much before you don't want any more. Great flavors. Could never drink alot of this at one sitting, and with the extremely well hidden 11%, this could be killer. Very smooth but sweet-ish beer."
"I really enjoyed this mad bastard, and I'll probably get more this season to drink and age. Love to see what a year or two may do to this."
"For some reason I feel the addition of juniper would greatly improve this beer. Get on that Troegs. Thank you."
"A good beer. I'd say be mindful of how you want to drink. Good by itself, but be particularly selective with a pairing. This beer packs a lot of strong favors that can easily take away from whatever you're eating it with."
"Not my favorite winter warmer, but it is without a doubt the most interesting."
"D - Alcohol is high and not masked. I would recommend it but dont go out of your way to get it."
"It is a beer that I recommend but I wouldn't necessarily go for the 6 pack since it also comes in a 22 oz bottle also."
"Overall: so for one reason or another this is my first Tröegs Mad Elf. And I live in PA for crying out loud. All I can say is I have a new favorite holiday seasonal and it's called Mad Elf. This is a tremendous blend of crazy flavors and mouthfeel that all blend together in a sort of organized chaos. I highly recommend this one."
"Overall good beer, cant wait to see what a year of cellaring will do to this."
"It's remarkable how much I was reminded of my favorite non-beer alc-beverage, Drambuie, when tasting this. It's a well-made brew, if not mind-blowing. A nice digestif - at the least, something to have on a special occasion - but with the slow-creeping and dope-ifying and dastardly-concealed 11%, I'd have trouble putting down more than one at a time."
"M- Very very low on carbonation. It makes it seem that not all of this beer ever leaves the palate, creating a slick afterfeel."
"An interesting take on a belgian. The fruit is a nice compliment to the overall beer. The alcohol does rear its head a bit to take the drinkability down a notch. A really nice beer that is worth trying."
"Overall, a tasty holiday beer, one of the better ones."
"The feel of this beer is light and playful and almost goes down too easy helping you forget that it's 11% ABV. It is very drinkable, goes down easy and is quite refreshing."
"D= This beer is super drinkable for the strength of it. Tastes like cherry pie and finishes clean as hell. Worth checking out."
"D - For such a high alcohol beer this is pretty damn drinkable. Does NOT drink like a Stong Dark Ale, in fact, I don't think it is one. More of a Belgian Specially Ale. Not stellar, but certainly a good drinking brew."
"DB- The flavor to me is a decent mix of dark cherry and strong Belgian yeast spice. The high ABV makes this a one bottle deal for me, a sipper."
"Poured into a tumbler, the beer is clear reddish amber with very little head. The smell is very sweet, obviously sweetened. Cherries are noticeable in the aroma and taste with a with the Belgian yeast coming through on the end. A touch of alcohol. Kind of a slick feel to it, four of these beers will sneak up on you and beat you over the head if drunk too quickly."
"Delicious. Despite the high abv I really didn't get any warming feeling."
"drinkability; taste good but does not hide the alcohol well. I would definitly drink again but would not seek it out."
"Flat. Super boozy."
"The reviews seem to be all over the board on this. I think I'm taking the middle ground, but there's much better interpretations of winter BSDA out there (Delirium Noel comes to mind, I'm sure there's others)"
"D--Very nice overall. This was a first for me but I found it very good. I could drink these on a semi-regular basis during the winter"
"Overall - One of the more enjoyable 'holiday' beers that I've had. This beer is proof that great holiday beers can exist without a ton of the typical, potpourri type spices."
"Drinkabilty was smooth, with it's 11%alc./vol, you would think this would be a hot beer, it's high abv % is hidden well with the fruit flavors and just enough spice - very drinkable if you enjoy it slowly, really lets the flavors come out as it warms up."
"D: perhaps a bit too sweet to be an easy drinking brew but the taste definitly begs for the next sip"
"Wow. Yummy! Pours a ruby red with just a thin whit head. Not much aroma, a little cherry and candy. The taste is incredible. Rich sweet malt and cherry. Plus that nice spicy yeast just adds to the mix. There is also a nice honey tone that keeps the cherries from overpowering. This is the way to brew with cherries. The beer keeps the sweetness without the medicinal/cough syrup that a lot of cherry brews have. This is just a great winter brew. There is no way you would ever guess it was a 11% ABV beer. SUPER drinkible! One of my new favorites."
"D- Not a bad beer necessarily, but I had much higher hopes for this one."
"D- Wow, I been told by a few people that I should give this a try and they were right. This is very easy to enjoy and does not fell like it is 11% ABV. This is a great winter beer that I will definitely be buy more of soon."
"The taste follows the smell with dark fruits and funky yeast esters, but sourness is stopped short by a bitter bite. The esters thrown off by the yeast dominate the mouthfeel and it lingers. As that hits, the alcohol tries to take center stage and makes it feel more medicinal. This beer is sort of all over the place. The flavors come at you in waves and are not well-integrated. Is it sour or bitter? The two sensations fight it out and you're left wondering what it should be. It does improve a little when it warms up and it's possible that laying this down for a year might balance it out and make it more drinkable than it is right now. Still, this won't be on my yearly ""look for"" list."
"D: its very hard to tell that this is over 10%, making it real easy to put down.. Had to remind myself to sip.."
"a lot going on turns this one into a sipper as does the alcohol heat and sweetness. it doesn't quite come together seamlessly, though it is tasty. alcohol is there though not quite as harsh as 11% could be. reminds me a bit too much of cough syrup as it warms. very good, not great."
"Overall another great beer from Troegs and it gets better as it gets warmer. Go and get it while it lasts."
"I am going to celler the rest of my pack and re visit them thorughout the year. Also at over $17 a 6 pack here in Ohio i wishi would have got a single instead."
"This beer is a pure winner. I look forward to this one every year and I could definitely drink it every day. This is Troegs best beer, IMHO."
"O: This beer definitely improved with age. Glad I put down 4 or 5 from the last few years! Can't wait to see what happens next. 4.5"
"Linger: 4"
"Minimal carbonation, very little if any head, no lacing. Clear reddish brown body, no visible carbonation. Nose is mostly cherries, some sweet notes re honey subsumed by the fruit, a wee bit of floral hops. Taste mirrors the nose, very sweet, not sure this fits into BSDA style tastewise. I got a hit of effervescence my first taste then it was flat as a pancake, medium-light mouthfeel, not sticky. ABV very well hidden for this alcohol bomb, but IMHO this needs significant cellaring. Will be stashing a bottle or two for next Christmas. To be honest, quite underwhelming."
"D: could drink this all night.... if they weren't such a high abv"
"D - Drinkability is moderate. I didn't find myself drinking this really quickly, but that is mostly as a result of the relatively hot finish. Assuming all is right and some age can reduce this, I could find this being a great drinking beer a few months down the road. As of now, however, this is a pretty decent sipper that packs quite a punch."
"Although the smell might indicate complexity, the taste does not follow through."
"D- Although this not a low abv beer Troegs does a wonderful job disguising it without burying it beneath the sweet and spiciness making Mad elf superbly drinkable. Wish it a little bit fuller body but other than that I really enjoyed this ale."
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle. Nice dark red/brown color, with a strong fruity aroma (cherries predominant) and a hint of spice. No visible head, medium carbonation. Taste of cherries is overpowering; smooth silky finish leaves you wanting more. Very good drinkability. Even though it has 11% ABV, you don't feel it until you are more than halfway into the beer. Another solid beer from Troegs. They definitely have some winners."
"Deep ruby/amber red with a thin head that fizzes into nothing. Pretty much looks like still red tap water. Although this beer leaves no head, the aroma is not masked at all. Big cherry, clove, Belgian yeast, and caramel malt aroma dominates the nose. Flavor follows the nose - sweet malt backbone with a nice yeasty spice. Cherry/fruity flavors also present, but take a back seat to the typical Belgian strong ale profile. For a beer with no head, this beer is actually pretty well carbonated. Bubbly on the tongue that leaves a sugary sweet coating behind. Very drinkable, I do not want to put this one down."
"This is a solid, interesting seasonal from Troeg's that is worth trying at least once. It seems to be a bit polarizing but I enjoy what they've done. The flavors are balanced and nothing feels out of place."
"Pretty full bodied with minimum carbonation. This slightly sweet and syrupy beer should be a welcome adition to anyone's winter celebration."
"Drinkability on this one is great. Though it has a high ABV, it is covered very well. As you drink this brew, there is a nice little burn on the back of the throat, but the brew is solid and is an amazing holiday brew. I will most certianly seek this brew out again this season."
"Overall: There is no other brew I can think of that divides more people than this one in my little circle of beer geeks. Some think it's gimmicky and not worth the money. As for me... I dig it and look forward to its release every holiday season!"
"D: As a BSDA, it's merely OK. As a winter warmer, it's more than acceptable."
"Overall, an excellent winter brew. Picking this up on a 30F night will definitely help warm you up. I wish I had started aging these years ago because they're just going to get more complex with time. And for roughly $4 a bomber, I will be stocking up this year."
"D- full of soul. So smooth when cold you would never guess the alcohol content. Slight burn at the back of throat just to let you know you aren't messing around. Overall sweet and spicy. Absolutely delicious."
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has an amber color with a small head. Smell is sweet, cherries and a bit of spice. Taste is good, cherries, spices, a bit of sweetness and a touch of alcohol. Feels full bodied in the mouth and has good drinkability, although not exactly a session beer. Overall this is a high quality beer."
"I have heard so much about this beer. I was desperate to find it despite the fact I don't like fruity beers. But the fruit is well balanced by the bitter spice and I think the two really complement one another. Walked right into the local liquor store and there it was, the elf staring me in the face! I couldn't find the stuff last season! I am not disappointed with the beer itself -- it is very unique and very good! I only question if it is really worth 14.99/six pk when I'm an hour's drive from the brewery. Perhaps I will answer that question after a couple more rounds! Regardless, this is a worthy belgian-style ale and not far from a top-notch brew!"
"For such a monster beer it sure had quite a tan head on top a mahogany color brew. Smell is sweet and heavy of cherry. Taste is sweet and honey. It has a finish of spices like nutmeg, cinnamon cloves and other spices. The beer is pretty smooth with a noticeable but not overwhelming alcohol burn which warms the tongue and the soul. It goes down too easy but put visions of sugar plumbs dancing in my head way quicker then I'd feel comfortable cracking another bottle open for at this point."
"Drinkability: This is my new winter tradition after moving from Cleveland two years ago (although I still miss endless amounts of Christmas Ale). I get this on draft whenever I see it around and usually pick up quite a few bottles. I really enjoy this beer."
"Drinkabilty - Its too sweet and strong for much more then 1-2. A nice treat for anytime. Not sure if id get drunk or sick of the sweet kick first. Cant wait, i got a case, going to age a few of these"
"All in all, one of my favorite holiday beers to quaff. Why not have a little Christmas in October?"
"Well, I admit this is not even close to what I expected. Which isn't to say this isn't good, it is quite tasty, just be careful if your expecting lots of fruity cherry flavors, as you may be disappointed."
"Pours reddish brown with a nice off white head with moderate staying power, although it does not leave a terrible amount of lace behind. The nose brings some dark fruits, Belgian yeast, and light cherry notes. A bit of booze and some spice. The taste is dark fruits and cherries with a bit of sweet bread. The feel is nice and medium with good carbonation and a nice alcohol warmth. Pretty good fresh, but this definitely takes on a new character with some age; looking forward to reviewing it in that manner."
"I poured it into a snifter, i had a nice redidish color with a nice thin whitehead that disaptes to a nice thin lace around the edge of glass. The aroma is sweet of cherries and honey. The taste is sweet but strong of fruit and cherries and a hint of honey. I think it is has a nice mouth feel to it and is very drinkable for a cold day."
"All in all, I enjoyed this beer, but it definitely wasn't anything mindblowing. That being said, I drank it with expectations of an American style that may have created different expectations that made me reflect differently on the beer again. I would definitely drink this again to review it to style. Thanks, Greg!"
"It isn't unpleasant-- it just is a bit boozy and isn't very complex."
"Very drinkable, but don't drink much. It's a heavy hitter. Unless the Christmas party is that bad, lol."
"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass. Pours dark dark amber with an abundant 2 finger head. Lots of carbonation. The first scents were of candied cherries and booze. One sip and it hits my tongue, the sharp unnatural candy cherry taste along with strong alcohol, not hidden at all. Some minor flavors of malts, nothing outstanding. All and all this brew might be great for a fast buzz if you can stomach it. I hope it mellows with age."
"I had this beer about over 6 months span from my first time in season to 2 weeks ago when 6 month age. And this beer mature very well. The sourness of the cherries die down and just so sweet the beer is like liquid candy with some kick. The age made it sweeter but also stronger which is good to my liking. I do enjoy this beer and wish this was a year round beer. The Troegs brothers got this making beer down and just impressing me and more."
"It smells like Black Cherries. I also pick up some caramel in the aroma. A clear copper color with a moderate white head. The flavor is very acidic and a little sour. I definitely pick up the sour cherries as well as honey and some citrus. Spicy aftertaste. Its very belgian-esque. Not for everybody, but I will buy this along with my other winter brews."
"Great brew!"
"D - I wouldn't call this representative of any particular style, much less belgian strong dark ale. But it is very ""good."" Very pleasent drinkability, almost dangerous."
"Thanks agains brees6221!"
"D: this is a great BSDA, the aroma promised something better than what I tasted, but overall it is not bad. The abv is very well hidden, this drinks more like a 7-8% brew."
"Very good beer. Unique, & a little mad, but I completely understand why one would want to sip this around the Yule log. Cherries forever!"
"THe feel is medium bodied and a smooth texture and moderate level of carbonation. Good stuff. I wish I could get this here. Very drinkable for such a rich and high gravity beer."
"Pours a dark orange-brown color, crystal clear, with a nice big white head which dissipates rather quickly. Aromas of cherries, honey and cloves. Nicely sweet, with flavors of cherries, brown sugar, honey and brown spices. Lightly carbonated and somewhat dry with a lingering, boozy finish."
"Not what I expect when the holidays roll around but it's a good beer. Recommended if you like big fruity belgian beers."
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied with carbonation being on the lower side. Drinkability is very good for being 11% abv. I really liked the cherry flavors in it, and I love cherries in general so this is a very drinkable beer for me. I will note that I actually liked it better when it was colder. It seemed to have more of a sweet cherry flavor when colder and it gained more of a malty, spicy almost Christmasy flavor when warmed. It wasn't bad warmer I just liked the cherry flavor when I first opened it better."
"D: Eh... It's ok. I didn't hate it this time, and unlike last time I managed to finish not only 12, but a full 22 oz. It's drinkable, but I won't go after it again."
"Poured into a globe glass, this beer showcases lots of carbonation but head formation/retention seems poor. Hazy and dark amber in color with a thin off-white head that dissipated quickly. Spices and cherries mix with bready malts in the nose. Cherries carry through into the taste but tend to lie beneath the richer, bready malts. Lacking in complexity I'd expect from this style. Bitterness is moderate though the tart cherries help carry balance. Medium/medium-full bodied with a moderate-high level of carbonation. Overall, not that impressed with the execution on this beer. Perhaps I'm drinking an old bottle but I'd certainly not order a second."
"(D)- Tastes good, but is far too sweet & syrup-like to enjoy more than a glass in one sitting. Especially disappointing considering the style it is classified under. Seems much more like a fruit beer than a belgain strong dark."
"The beer pours a medium red color with a white head. The aroma is honey and tart cherries. The flavor is more of the same: Heavy on the honey with some tart cherries as well. This is one of the first beers I have had that you can really smell and taste the honey in. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"D: I really like this beer, but probably couldn't drink more than two of these in one setting between the high ABV and sweetness."
"Overall- probably one of the more complex beers I've ever had, which is a good thing. Good seasonal brew in a class of its own."
"I got this in a beer club as a 'big"" beer. This was the biggest and one of the most drinkable"
"D: I couldn't drink a ton of this, but it's enjoyable in small quantities."
"Mouth/Drink: Thin mouthfeel, drinkability for me is low due to how sweet this is. Overrated? I think so. Its not a bad beer, but not a ""WOW""ing brew."
"Overall Impression: This is Troegs Christmas offering and it is a very unique brew. It's not cheap for the budget conscious, but it is worth a try. After sipping this Mad Elf, I'm one happy Elf!"
"D: Unfortunately, this beer didn't seem to be all put together. Luckily, the flavor is better than the nose, but not amazing in any sense."
"D: A bit too sweet for me to drink more than one. Also, the cherries, while great, would become excessive after a while."
"Ahhh now I feel the two beers that were in the half-22 I just had..."
"Tröegs Mad Elf is a very clear and dense, coppery red ale with a thin, sand colored head that fades to a film and leaves decent lacing on the glass. It has a very strong, sweet aroma of cherries. Deeper in the nose is a medicinal note. It's pretty full bodied and syrupy with a slightly sticky finish. It has a pretty sweet flavor. Cherries are prominent but so is resiny wood. A little green bitterness comes in at the finish, along with black pepper. The aftertaste is kind of oaky and spicy. This would be great Christmas party beer. Is this a braggot?"
"Drinkability: At 11% ABV this is definitely a nice treat. Great for sipping and warming up with some spice and fruit. One of the better winter seasonals out there in my opinion."
"D - For the Belgian Strong Dark Ale it doesn't drink like one. It's just not as smooth as I expected it to be, but at 11% it does go down pretty easily."
"I love this one. everything you should expect in a seasonal winter beer. All the fruity spicy hearty flavor. A glass of this is a meal. I am thinking about buying the last 6 pack up the street just to have it for myself! I can't really think of any reason it's not a 5 all around actually. Of the 162 I have tasted in the last 6 weeks...it is in my top ten! If you see it ...give it a chance! Delicious."
"A very good beer that is different than most belgian style beers because of the banana flavors."
"An interesting beer, a good beer for a cold winter day. Quite a bit of alcohol to consume so that limits drinkability."
"nice crisp carbonation that settles to a minimum carb towards the end. medium to heavy mouthfeel. easy drinking for 11%, hardly noticable, wouldve guessed 7-8%. nice beer, other than the appearence, this is a very good example of a belgian, close to the real thing. warms you up on those cold winter nights, i highly suggest you seek this out."
"The noticable differnces from this beer on tap verse the bottle is that the mouthfeel is significantly lighter but that is probably mostly in part due to the higher level of carb than the bottle version."
"Poured from a 12oz. bottle into a duvel tulip. Pours a deep amber with very litte head or lacing to speak of, but the head is reddish tan and fades quickly. The aroma is sour cherries and the spices. A very good representation of a BSDA here even if the color is a little light for the style. The sour cherries and spicy yeast really come through. No honey flavor to speak of except maybe in the slightly sweet finish. The 11% abv is very well hidden here, very smooth drinking. Another great beer from Troegs. I would love to try this beer with a bit of age on it and i just may."
"Overall - A sipper, but a good brew nonetheless. A good take on a Belgian Strong Ale and I can see this being good fresh and with some age on it."
"Brew poured to a copper color with some reddish highlights. Small light tan head that breaks down quickly. The aroma is a mix of berries, cherries, slight spice and alcohol - simply a lovely aroma. Flavors of cherries which give a slight tart feel, nice malt character, no real hop presence noticed. Alcohol flavor is there and leaves a nice hot feel in the back of the mouth. Though the alcohol is there is does not stand out, and I think that is due to a sweet finish. Though there was not much of a head the carbonation was good, went well with the beer. This brew is a surprise as it weighs in art 11 ABV, does not have that feel as the alcohol is hidden quite well. Though this is a sipper it goes down remarkably smoothly."
"A very pleasant and festive beer. A bit more spice than usually found in a Belgian dark, but, as a holiday beer, certainly appropriate. Nice yeast flavors with good depth and complexity. Malt was not overly sweet and well balanced. Thanks to Blake for bringing this to the Bowling Green KY BA holiday beer gathering."
"No doubt this is a very good and interesting beer. I have been wanting to review it for a while and glad to finally get the chance!"
"Drinkability - Very drinkable, especially given the 11% alcohol factor (although it is recognizable, it doesn't detract from the beer). Definitely on the sweet end."
"My wife who likes beer, but is not a beer geek (i.e. hates stouts, barley wines, most porters, IPAs,...) thought this was a very good beer and would not complain if I poured her another one tomorrow night."
"D- Got a nice buzz from this 22oz bottle, 11% ABV. A pretty good brew, just not my cup of tea"
"A great winter ale that is very enjoyable and one of the best winter beers I've ever tasted...the taste was wonderful and the overall beer had a great feel, and yet it did some damage from the high ABV in a sneaky way because it goes down smooth. This beer can make any winter evening enjoyable. I highly recommend this beer."
"This is one of my absolute favorite beers. If you like honey and/or cherries in your beers, you absolutely must try this. If you're not as big a fan of them, you should probably try it anyways."
"Cheers!"
"Drinkability on this is fairly good, though I don't see this beer being for me outside the holidays. I do like fruit beers, and I like Lambics and Belgians; I would have done better to pair this beer than drink it alone."
"An enjoyable ale, glad I had the chance to try it. Would never know the abv on this beer, it really is completely hidden."
"D: Spicy and festive. A good holiday beer."
"Having not read the reviews before trying this I was a bit surprised. It's a little too fruity, has a little too much spice for the fruitness, is a little too alcoholic, but has a little too little alcholic flavor showing.... yet it's a decent beer and one I'd drink again this winter."
"oh wait, when paired w/ a mild butter brie this beer is quite improved..."
"Cellared 1 year: Big body but bland with a lot of the cherry tartness having faded and the chief flavor being the honey."
"This is a drinkable Belgian Strong Dark. I expected the cherries and honey to be a little more prevalent. Went nicely with Christmas dinner; particularly the ham and sweet potato casserole."
"D) A nice Belgian in style. Was hoping for something unusual / unique that would make this a standout... oh well, still a good brew."
"A good beer, but not blown away by it. Malty and fruity, but not in your face. A good Amer-belgian-strong-malty-beer."
"In conclusion, this is quite a good beer but not mind blowing."
"It's very malty and has a strong alcohol taste. Very biting. I think this would do better aged, but it's extremely flavorful. Aftertaste is sourish...kind of detracts."
"Overall this seems to be a somewhat polarizing beer however I found everything to be present in good amounts and nothing seemed overpowering. Worth a shot."
"Serving type: bottle"
"D: This is a nice one or two glass brew. Very complex taste, which is well worthy of savoring. A very good winter time brew and overall a good take on the style. Give it a try..."
"D: One was good for me. A nice brew to try, but not something I am going to drink all night.. Would be very interesting in a tasting session."
"Overall, this brew is refreshing and pretty drinkable, though I'm not sure it's worth the sixteen dollars for a six-pack."
"mouthfeel is a bit syrupy, it coats the mouth with the flavors."
"Thanks ShadesOfGray!"
"Can't wait for next years release...it gives me something to look forward to."
"(Bottle into tulip) This beer came very highly recommended over the past 2 holiday seasons, but I had a hack of a time finding it until this year, and I frankly have been saving this one in anticipation. I was NOT disappointed!! Poured a nice red color but with little to no head that was gone in a heartbeat. The nose was heavy with the honey and cherry as advertised, as well as a background of the alcohol. Lively carbonation on the tongue and the drink itself is very smooth. The taste was very surprising, however, as I was expecting more sweetness based on the aromas. There was some sweet there, but also a nice spicy bite (nutmeg?) that lingered, giving that warm holiday feeling and a fine finish. I will definitely be on the lookout for more next year!!"
"Drinkability: This beer drinks very smoothly, which is frightening considering the present nature of the alcohol in this beer. Definitely meant to be a winter sipper. I will enjoy this beer as the snow continues to fall here in Kansas."
"Sure, it is smooth, but the 11% kills it. Have 1 if you are going out to a bar and need to save some cash."
"Drinkability: Great winter style beer. I wouldnt have more than 1, maybe 2 of these because this is a very strong high abv beer. Nice though."
"No frills yet not bad either. Lots of cherry flavor and holiday cheer. Good seasonal brew to look forward to. No head what so ever though. No pun intended. Will look forward to this delivery each season, but not one of the best from Troegs though. Do not let that discourage you from trying it. It is still a good ale."
"D - Did not really touch me."
"First time I had this was about a week ago, on tap at the Blue Tusk in Syracuse, NY. My palate might have been wrecked by that point in the evening, but it seemed like a strong/spiced English ale then...aroma-wise, it definitely has more Belgian character than anything, but I still feel like the medicinal, unsubtle vibe of Mad Elf is reminiscent of big spiced English holiday ales, and evidence beyond just name and label that this is indeed a tribute to Ridgeway's Bad Elf stuff. Glad to have tried it twice now, but not super-anxious to return."
"for my first try into this style i feel a little overwhelmed but i do like it and wish to try other beers from this style."
"Overall, this is a good holiday beer. It goes along with the festive atmosphere, but the excessive sweetness and cherries are a bit too much for me."
"A yummy one-off strong dark. I'd get one next Christmas."
"D: A little sweet for me. I'm not a huge cherry flavor fan. I like to eat cherries but would never drink cherry syrup in something. This reminds me of cherry syrup. Not bad though as I have had it a bunch of time so I will certianly drink it."
"D - This is a decent holiday seasonal but not sure it holds up to many other beers of the Belgian Strong Dark style. Tannins nicely balance how sweet this is upfront. Probably won't pick up another unless it's got some age."
"I'm not crazy about Mad Elf but I do like it a fair bit, namely because its ability to age, its Christmasy flavours of figgy pudding and cranberry, its spicy yeast and warming sensation make it an extremely apt beer for the holidays. It likely wouldn't be the first thing I'd grab when hankering for a yuletide tipple, but if I were more in the spirit for a nightcap, I might be inclined to skip the port and go straight for the Tröegs."
"D - Let's be honest this is a strong beer and the taste only hides it slightly w/ little real fruit flavor to speak of and lots of alcohol which isn't something I personally find to be all that drinkable. I admit it is pretty smooth for the abv, with honey not overpowering, but too much for more than 1 IMO."
"D. It is Definatly a beer i could enjoy again and again"
"Pours a nice, light and clear ruby color with a very thin bubbly white ring of foam. Smell is of yeasty bread, faitn spicing plus a kiss of honey and marachino cherry. Taste kicks the scent profile up a notch with a very noticable belgian yeasty background with a good candy cherry and mildly sweet honey flavor. Some spicing and wheat flavors on the back end and a noticable boozy touch. Slightly undercarbonated, lighter side of medium bodied. A decent beer, but lacks the punch i remember it having in the past."
"Overall, I should have spent the holiday with Three Philosopher's or just gotten some Delirium Nocturnum. Pretty big letdown, I was expecting a far darker and more complex beer. Other people seem to like this and it isn't bad, just not worth the price at all in my opinion, and I was definitely in the mood for a Belgian strong dark ale tonight."
"Overall, I was impressed with this one and very drinkable for the abv and the little hint of booze that showed. I really enjoyed this one and it is a great seasonal."
"D: I love this beer. Just a great treat during the holidays."
"Despite a big sweet presence, it dried up remarkably well, and I forgot to sip it. Downed two pints very easily. Then again, I've got a sweet tooth and my buddy didn't really care for it, preferring to stick with the Dogfish Head pale ale. But one of the better American takes on the Belgian style I've had. Looking forward to trying more from Tröegs this holiday season!"
"D - Pretty thick and filling beer for my tastes. Not bad by any means, but drinking too many of these might give you the same feeling as eating too much candy. The high ABV would also prevent you from having too many of these, but not a bad treat if you are looking to fulfill the desire for a beer while also getting your sweet tooth fix."
"Since I've been brewing my own beer, I've made the statement that commercial beers now taste like ""Lite"" beers to me. After having a Mad Elf, I had one of my homebrews and my homebrew tasted like a Lite beer. HEH!"
"OVERALL Cloying would be too strong a description, but it's not hard to imagine some finding this way too sweet. Alcohol presence is restrained, thankfully, considering how much of it is in there. And there are some other interesting things going on in there, like the aforementioned banana smell and taste reminiscnet of German weiss beers. Definitely a sipper. Glad I tried it. Thank you BuckeyeNation for the great trade and hand delviery."
"This is very, very drinkable and can easily creep up quickly and trainwreck you if not paying attention. In fact, I'm amazed how drinkable it is because I'm not one for sweeter types of beers. Very well done, one of the better ones from Troegs."
"D- This is a sipper, but as far as a Winter Warmer goes it does it's job well."
"Not bad, though it's too sweet to be more than a sipper. A little brash on the esters, could be dialed down a notch. Can't say I would jump to drink this one again, though perhaps in the bottle or with some age it might mellow a touch."
"Both myself and Eric had some of this on tap, and neither of us knew that it was such a high ABV. Although its detectable its pretty well-hidden and I would have guessed 7 or 8%. A nice winter warmer!"
"The taste is sweet honeyed malts, with some cherry flavors throughout. There is a touch of spice to the beer, almost a biting nutmeg type spiciness. The beer is overall quite sweet but also very warming from the high ABV. There is a touch of throaty burn as the beer goes down. The beer is a bit deceptive. The ABV is apparent, but the 11% extent of the ABV is fairly well hidden. This is a sipping beer and it is surprisingly watery in body for a beer of this content. It doesn't have the syrupy consistency I would have expected. This is a decent beer, certainly appropriate for the holiday season, but not a beer I would seek out."
"This is a very tasty beer, though it is difficult to drink more than two in one sitting."
"The beer poured a beautiful clear, dark amber with a thin white head into a chalice. The aroma was heavy with bubble-gum Belgian yeast and sour cherry - very nice. A big tart bite up front, with the cherry and bubble-gum flavors dominating, transitioning into a slightly sour/tart malt finish with alcoholic ester undertones. A slightly astringent mouthfeel, but not unpleasant. A very smooth-drinking strong ale, especially considering the very high ABV - great for sipping on a cold winter's day."
"I've noticed the beer tends to be more impressive upfront and then becomes softer through out the glass."
"Notes: A bit short of its reputation (in particular on its presentation at least on this year´s batch) but nevertheless a rather pleasing and celebratory winter fruity ale, with a marked spicy-Belgium memory."
"D - goes down nice and slow which is good for a brew at 11%."
"Very interesting beer. Pours a dark, dark amber. Great looking beer. Nothing overpowers in the aroma and that translates into the taste. Slight hints of cherry and honey. Again nothing overpowers. Very balanced and drinkable. Especially considering the ABV."
"D: easy to drink...would be good dessert beer."
"EDIT: the more I drink this the more it seems like an imperial hefeweizen....i like it."
"It's interesting how I rated the first half of my pour compared to the second. I did a lot of crossing out on my review sheet as my opinion continued to change for the worse. Each criteria except appearance was docked at least one entire point by the end of my review. OVERWHELMING. The flavor and aromatics were relentless."
"I remember having this last year and not being impressed. Either this year's batch is different or I'm drinking it fresher (or maybe my tastes have just evolved), because enjoyed it much more. 12 oz bottle in a standard shaker, amber color and clear. Taste is cinnamon, clove, honey. I don't get the cherries, but this is a nice winter warmer (this doesn't seem to have the characteristic belgian yeast qualities to me to be called a belgian strong)."
"Drinkability is pretty good, on tap at least. This beer will hit you hard."
"Drinkability is exceptional. I always grade drinkability with a curve for higher ABV beers. For as strong and distinct as this is, I think it's absurdly drinkable. Too strong for more than two (at the most), but a great beer!"
"Future outlook: I recall having this once before where the carbonation/feel seemed a bit better....and I'm typically a big fan of Troegs, so this is fairly likely to get another try from me in the future."
"Overall - A masterpiece from Troegs, I'll drink the Doppelbock 11 months out of the year, but this is my new fave from them."
"Poured reddish amber into an American pint glass, with a very small head and spotty lacing. Sour cherry, mandarin orange, brown sugar, and malt in the nose. Medium-bodied, bittersweet, and good hop/malt balance throughout, with the alcohol presence surfacing in the form of a warm finish, and warm afterfeel. Would love to try some aged bottles of this to see how much it smoothens."
"Not overly sweet, nor medicinal, this is a well crafted little winter warmer - perfect for a cold (well, for Los Angeles) evening."
"Poured from the bottle into my snifter this beer is a beautiful clear ruby with a head that quickly disappears into nothing. A steady stream of small bubbles rises from the bottom of the glass. On the nose I get some sour cherries and sweetness like candy. The flavor started with some cherries but as it warms I'm getting more of the honey and a wheat-like character with the tart cherries taking more of a back seat. The mouthfeel is pretty good and I get a bit of tingling from the bubbles on the back of my tongue from the carbonation. As I sit here drinking this and listening to some relaxing Christmas music I feel like I could drink a whole lot of it. I don't detect any of the 11% abv in the taste, making this one dangerous elf. I can definitely see this beer becoming a Christmas tradition."
"D- Great beer that is so easy to drink. Being 11%, it is a real wallop of alcohol, but it is barely detectable until the post drinking warming feeling."
"D - doesn't not taste like a 11% ABV beer at all - this is dangerously drinkable. Perhaps because there isn't much residual sweetness."
"I had heard this was a red/amber ale, so I was surprised to find out it's actual style. I actually ended up getting a 22oz, which wound up being a little too much. All in all it was ok, I wouldn't go out of my way to try it again."
"Overall, not my favorite 11% ABV (Old Guardian), but it's very good. I could see it becoming a Christmas tradition. The buzz appears before the first glass is finished, and nearing the end of the second, I realized I was about finished."
"D- Not the best Belgian strong dark I've had, but an interesting take on the style worth trying."
"D - A little too sweet to have more than one in an evening, plus that alcohol content will really sneak up on you. However, it's probably one of the better fruity holiday beers out there in terms of balancing refreshment value with a seasonal holiday flavor without becoming too syrupy or overwhelming."
"I've seen quite a few comments on the boards that this is not what it used to be. Never tried it before, so I have no comparision, but if you like a sweet cherry strong ale, belly up and give it a whirl."
"Drinkability: Could sneak up on you.... but goes down easy."
"D: At 11%, this beer is deceptively smooth. It has enough flavors running around to keep me intrigued but not so much as to be overwhelming."
"Pretty good beer, worth trying and easy to enjoy, but doesn't quite stand up to some other staples of the style. If you've had some big dark ales from Belgium, just don't set your expectations too high and you will still enjoy this one."
"Doesn't pour as red as expected, with so much emphasis of the cherry on the bottle. Poured it extra rough to generate some head, since my last bottle yielded nothing with the traditional pour. The head built, but was gone quickly. It's a golden amber color and I notice a minimal amount of streaming bubbles. I smell cherries and banana and clove. Not overly impressive. Smells of Belgian yeast. Not picking up any hops on the nose. I have a feeling this beer would taste much better with a deep chill on it. It lacks the crispness that carries important flavors, so maybe the chill of refrigeration could help. I get a breadiness at first, and on the exhale the alcohol kicks in. Some cherries are very present as well. Mouthfeel fails here for me. Carbonation would send this beer over the edge, but without it I feel like I'm drinking a malty syrup. The beer is flavorful, but after two it's time to move on to something else."
"Head disapates quickly and not much lacing but a great aroma that hints of what is to come. You can feel the alcohol in this one but it is very drinkable. This made my mouth very happy and after two the rest of me was pretty happy too."
"D - Not horribly hard to drink at 11%, but this wasn't a beer I enjoy enough to drink a lot of it."
"There's a lot of good stuff about this, but by the end of it I'm kind of worn out & ready for a nap. I guess ""hard-hitting"" would be a way to describe it. This doesn't have quite the complexity that a big Belgian style normally would, but what's there is really good. Part of my appreciation for this beer is the nostalgia & associations I have with it -- it's become something of a tradition & is very comforting."
"D-very smooth and tasty=drinkability"
"The carbonation level is very low and the 11% ABV is very well hidden."
"Drinkability: A little to warm on the alcohol for my tastes. No problem finishing the 12oz'er, but a 2008 would probably taste amazing. I'm gonna buy a few more and drink them over the next few months to see how this develops."
"A very unique beer. The cherries and honey really come through, overwhelming most of everything. As the beer warms, some subtle earthy tones begin to shine. Alcohol is pretty overwhelming dropping the drinkability. A great after dinner beer, but not something one could drink a lot of. I also loved how this beer was not too sweet, attenuated perfectly. A must try."
"The beer finishes dryer than expected with such a big body, I'm impressed, the honey really brought this together well...this also leads to scary drinkability, be careful but imbibe."
"This was a bad idea that went badder (if I may). While not horrible, everything about it screamed artificial, cheap and tawdry. Does Boone's Farm make a cherry?"
"very light carbonation, served it at almost room temperature, and I think this is probably the best way to drink it in order to really bring out the full range of flavors. the high ABV and sweetness make this beer something I would probably only have one of at a time, or even split a bottle with someone. a sipping beverage for sure. all in all, definitely a great beer for the holiday season, as it warms the insides, and caters to being shared with good friends or family."
"D: I really want to like this beer, but it just doesn't quite make it for me. I think if Troegs balanced the sweet flavors with some malts and hops it would taste much better. My friend Zach had a good analogy for this one: It's like eggnog. I could enjoy a small glass of it, but I wouldn't want anymore after that glass. Also, if a beer is going to put me on the floor after drinking a few, I want it to be worth it!"
"Picked up a single for $2.99 to give it a try. Poured into a tulip shaped glass. More golden orange color than red. No head or carbonation at all, and it almost looks flat. Very sugary and boozy smell, a lot like a tripel. Smells like a nice dessert beer. Taste was good, but not as complex as I had hoped for. Very faint flavor of honey, but didn't really notice the cherries. Mostly tasted the sweetness reminiscent of a strong but sweet Belgian beer. I eneded up splitting a 12 oz bottle with my wife due to the sweetness and the prominent abv. I would be hesitant to pick up a whole six pack to drink. Though, aging one for a year or two might be an interesting experiment."
"Drinkability- definitely a sipper but not as much as I might have expected considering its 11 percent, its actually a very drinkable ale, I would definitely be curious to see how this would do with a little bit of age on it, overall a decent beer that gives you enough bang for your buck to justify the slightly high price, worth a seasonal look"
"So, seems to taste like a high-alcohol, oversweetened hefeweizen. Very seldom do I enjoy sweet beer, but this one makes my mouth and tummy happy. Though I'll admit to fantasizing about a drier version of the Elf..."
"For 11% abv this is a quite drinkable beer, however the alcohol sneaks up on you pretty quick. The flat appearance is a bit of a drag, but the complex flavor makes up for any faults."
"To be continued..."
"I was disappointed with this one. There is nothing wrong with it, but it certainly wasn't worth the $16 for 6 bottles. The bottle claims to have some cherry and honey notes. I didn't get any of those. It really lacks flavor."
"The mouthfeel is light and the drinkability is very high."
"D: Oh yeah, this beer has got holiday cheer written all over it! Spicy yeast, cherries, candi sugar, and alcohol make a very drinkable beer. Be careful though for too many will KYA!!"
"I can see why people age this stuff for years! I might pick another up to keep for quite some time to let it mellow out."
"A great winter seasonal."
"D: I could drink these all night. Certainly the best Winter Beer I've had this year. Smooth, and the high alcohol is almost unnoticeable as it works well to bring out the warm malts, substantial body of the honey, tart cherries, and collective holiday spices. Highly recommended."
"Review #700. 22oz. bottle served in my Bruery tulip. Poured a translucent mahogany with a one inch, bubbly, off-white head that eventually settles into a skim and a band of bubbles; no lacing on this one. Nose smells like cherry cough syrup. Taste consistent with nose - yep, cherry cough syrup. Mouthfeel is medium-light with a consistent background carbonation just shy of prickly; finishes somewhat dry. Interesting, but not what I expected. Seems to be missing some of the complexity of the style; although I have to say that the alcohol is very well-hidden on this one. Glad I gave it a try, but wasn't blown away by this one."
"Unlike some monster beers, when you are done, you aren't done, you want another. If I hadn't sworn off stocking my aging bin and the price of this weren't so high, I'd want to try some aged a year. I think it would mellow out quite a bit."
"D-A bit too sweet and alcoholic for me to drink much. Took me a while to finish one bottle. Still not a bad way to warm up when it's cold outside."
"Dr. Probably best as an after dinner dessert beer. Bought a case (it's PA after all) and now I'm wondering if it was a wise use of $58. Ah well, I'm in no hurry. It's in the beer closet."
"Drinkability: I liked this better on tap. It tastes like an enhanced farmhouse ale to me. The alcohol to me is dominate, but the cherry flavor is nice as well. A very good holiday treat, I will have this again."
"no head on the beer at all! how odd for a belgian. the body is a very nice black tea colour, and completely diaphanous and transparent. the nose is fairly strong, even more so when pouring and there is some foam. the nose is a good combo of fermented cherries, sweetness (the honey I'm guessing), and an elusive malt body-- one second it is quite strong, the next I can't find it. the only way I could tell this is a dark strong is from the intense boozy fruit, but no other real belgian characteristics. the taste is lacking quite a lot as well, too sweet, no spice, no booze, no real fruity characgter, just kind of a honey-sweet malt mixture. the feel is decent, a bit under carbonated; the drinkability is not, it is too sweet and not anything close to the way I imagine the style."
"Tröegs Mad Elf is a sweet and delicious cold weather treat."
"Final thoughts: A pretty nice Belgian strong ale, lots of Belgian sweets and malts and yeast, etc. Some spices, little honey, tangy fruit, not much on the cherry front. The only issue I see is that the alcohol is a little too overbearing. I think that could have been throttled back a bit. Otherwise a nice beer, sippin beer."
"D - i know its 11% but it is really not noticeable, however I think one bomber is just right, esp with the fruit/sweet of the beer that I usually can not take too much of; also, this is not a belgian strong dark ale"
"And then there's the booze. You never would of guessed it at first impression, but alas, yes it is 11%. Now I'm gonna go take my kid trick or treating. Half drunk. Thanks for nothing Troegs."
"Overall I really like this beer. I don't want to drink two in a row, but perhaps with a nice dessert, it would be most welcome. Definitely a little too warm out for a beer of this magnitude -- on a cold winter day by a fire, and I think this beer would come alive. Highly recommended, especially given how much complexity this beer brewed with fruit really has."
"Note- Doesn't strike me as a Belgian Strong Dark... maybe a Belgian Spiced Amber, if such a category existed. Whatever it is... it's fantastic!"
"D: This is a nice beer, and as it warms it gets better. Even though the alcohol is detectable, it doesn't distract you from everything else that's going on."
"D - Great sipping beer but the high ABV doesnt make it very conducive to having more than one or two."
"Overall: I am a fan of this and will be checking back to report on how it fairs with some age. The honey isn't too prevalent but it is still a nice flavorful brew nonetheless with just the right amount of yeast coming through."
"Drinkability: I think it would be very easy to drink way too much mad elf way too fast. Really delicious beer, but one that I can only take in moderation due to the bold flavors and the high level of sweetness. I also find an 8 dollar bomber a little bit pricey for what it brought to the table, but I would still considering buying another."
"D - Definitely a sipper at 11%. Alcohol makes its presence known. Very malty with lots of belgian flavors and tons of cherry. Very good winter beer for finishing off a night in front of the fire."
"22 ounce bottle from 2008. Served in a snifter, the beer pours a dark ruby red color with about a quarter inch off-white head that went away pretty quickly. Not much lacing, either. Aroma is fruity and sweet, it smells like cherries, honey, and a bit of yeast and spice (cinnamon). The taste is similar to the aroma, but with the addition of some chocolate and a little bit of booze. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit coating and has low carbonation. Drinkability is good, it's smooth and goes down easy. For the most part the 11% ABV is well hidden. It does catch up to you after a while, but that's to be expected. This brew has aged well, I like it better with a year of age on it compared to drinking it fresh."
"Drinkability: amazing if you let it warm up to almost room temp, and keep sipping lightly, if i try to drink it too fast i start to dislike it. nice sipping with the strong alcohol going with it is excellent, you have to remind yourself its 11% abv"
"Drinkability: This is a dangerously drinkable beer. However it's a beer for sipping. At this ABV it would be easy to drink too much, and with this level of cherry/sweetness it begins to cloy if sipped to quickly. I definitely enjoy this beer and will return to it again. Indeed if history is a judge I'll have a case laid in when it is released this year and most of it won't see the New Year."
"CHEERS!"
"D: Pretty easy to put down, but not the best"
"d: This was one of the first craft beers i tried many years ago. It was almost my last because I thought it was terrible. I like it a lot more today, but it isn't something I would crave often."
"Taste was very full on the palate. Fruits exposed in the form of cherries. Swet and malty with virtually no hops noticed, but surely there."
"Medium bodied and pretty smooth. The alcohol really sneaks up on you with this one as the 11% really can't be detected too well in the taste. Once I got used to this one, I could have drank quite a few. Appearance aside, the taste was great and very inviting despite the high abv."
"I cant wait until Mad Elf comes out again."
"Pours an reddish ruby color with a one finger head. The beer gives way to little or no lacing. The smell is of roasted malts, with some fruit tones to it. The taste is fantastic, it taste of malt with cherry overtones and a honey note to smooth out the flavor. This beer is full bodied and moderately carbonated. The overall drinkability on this beer is very high, even with the high alcohol content the taste isn't overly alcohol and it is very very smooth, overall an a+ all around."
"Drink is excellent very drinkable 11%ABV this shocked me the most. Easy to go down and a few more but not too many or you will be down and out. Rather quickly."
"D-This is 11%--really? I know it is sweet but...I cant help myself. I find this to be one of my indulgent treats each and every holiday season (and out of season when available!) Honey goodness with a light cherry pop...and then the ABV kicks you in the head after your third pint!"
"Overall a different tasting Belgian style that's pretty tasty."
"Overall, I'm just going to chalk this one up to being aged too long or bad storage conditions. I've heard too many good things about Troegs to be turned off by one possibly bad beer. I will revisit this beer in the winter if possible."
"D: The finish and aftertaste is dry and makes you want to continue drinking this beer. Unfortunately, this one just wasn't for me at all. I'd like to re-visit it around holiday time but I think Great Lakes Christmas Ale is still my go-to festive brew."
"Update! - A year and a half later I had the opportunity to try a fresh bottle of this beer and I found it to be more rough around the edges with more alcohol. The one I reviewed was at least 5 months old and I enjoyed it much more"
"Not really coming across as really big in the cherry department, but there is plenty of warming alcohol. A bit limp and flat in the end and certainly does not seem a good cellar candidate."
"D: Goes down easy when kept at proper temperature in appropriate glassware. But it's also 11% ABV, so it will knock you on your ass pretty much without warning. For that quality alone, I do not recommend this as a session beer."
"--"
"Pours a three finger white head that fades quickly leaving traces of lace. Clear amber/red color. Good carbonation and medium bodied. Honey nose. Flavor is sweet honey with hints of cherry. Smooth honey finish. High ABV is totally hidden, is it really 11% ABV?? $3.25 for a 12oz bottle from Colonial Spirits Acton, MA."
"D- This is a very sweet beer. The alcohol is hidden well but I find the banana flavor to be a little runtesque (like the candy ...). I don't know if i could handle more than one of these in a sitting but it is a good nightcap."
"My last Mad Elf until next winter. A 12 ounce bottle of 2008 vintage Elf poured into a snifter. Appears a crystal clear pure copper color akin to cream soda with a quickly fading half inch of off white foam. The head leaves no lacing on my glass. Smells of cherries, malty, sweet and fruity. Tastes of brandy soaked cherries, sweet biscuity malts, plums, figs, alcohol, a hint of cocoa, and dark raisins. This ale is a notch or two above medium in body with ample carbonation. After only a few months in the bottle the alcohol is still quite noticeable making this a sipper/ nightcap beer."
"Split a bottle with a friend that we found when we were cleaning out his beer fridge (over 120 loose beers left over from tastings and parties)couldn't believe the thicknessor the amazing taste. A great winter warmer type of beer,. A slow drinker and a little boozy but I really could have used this a week ago when we got random snow on opening day. Fantastic and would definitely buy now that troeggs distributes to my area and i don't have to drive to get some from PA."
"Thanks to pebkac for the brew!"
"I wouldnt manage to drink another one of these. This beer didnt live up to my expectations and is nothing special to seek out."
"D - Pretty strong on the alcohol, so this is to drink a lot of. One and done for me."
"Overall: It's a good beer that we enjoyed splitting. It was a bit sweet for my tastes, but Tim enjoyed it a lot. It was a fine beer that we both recommend, but it's more for a night in than a night out."
"D- Tried this one a couple of times and no thanks I'll pass on this one."
"not my favorite troegs, but very good beer nonetheless"
"D: For an %11 ABV beer this one sure goes down easy. A really nice beer."
"Overall: The mouth feel is carbonated and creamy. The body of the beer is medium full and the finish linger on the palate. I really didn't know what to expect from this beer. When I read cherries I was expecting a tartness in the beer but it was subtle. The flavors in this beer are expressive and evil. It hides the alcohol content very very well. I was disappointed not to see a head but the taste made up for it. I would say it need a touch more malt to the body of the beer to give it a wonderful complex flavor."
"light to moderate carbonation helps to bring out a peak in the middle of flavors overall. some light syrup feel."
"Poured this into my snifter. It has the color of dark reddish and ruby appearances. Aromas of sweet fruit with a slight bite to it. On the first sip you can notice the alcohol but that quickly fades as you can taste more sweet fruity flavors, definitely the cherries with hints of honey. Mouthfeel gets a slightly gummy or sticky after a few tastes but overall not bad. This one goes down relatively smooth considering its so high in alcohol. This is one of my favorite winter beers."
"A very solid beer that I will probably try again next year. I would like to put some aside since I think the sweetness would mellow and the mouthfeel would soften."
"What it does do is offer a wonderful aroma. It smells like christmas inside that bottle. The taste however makes it not very high on drinkability."
"I can't pick out the cherries, but that doesn't diminish my enjoyment. Not my typical brew, but a really nice foray into malt territory."
"Great beer, can't wait to have this next Christmas!"
"D- This beer has some great Belgian strong dark ale qualities with a mysterious malt flavor that is sweet and rich and has a nice accent of cherries to it. This is a great winter sipper."
"Pours a ruby-tinted deep amber with a thin off-white head on top. Leaves just a ring along the edge. No lace present. Scents of strawberries, cherries, grass, and a sharp astringent cleaning-solution-like scent. Full creamy body on this beer still. Moderate amount of carbonation. Still has a subtle crisp bite to it. Flavors of red licorice, some light yeast, and faint tannins? This has become more of a fruit-beer, than a Belgian, with time. Much sweeter than I remember as well. I like what some time did to this beer. I've still got an '07 in the cellar that I'll have to pull out sometime soon and see how that one held up."
"Feel and Drinkability: Carbonation is extremely low, I think that it could be a bit higher, I mean really, you can't really even feel it on the tongue when it sits in the mouth. Feel is medium-heavy with a definite lean towards heavy here....carbonation again. It feels okay in the mouth, I think that the carbonation sould be more delicate...and in more abundance, but while being more delicate....its there to lighten the body a bit, give some scrubbing action-just a bit-and to fill out the overall feel, make it more beer like...I'll finish the bottle, but as of now this isn't one that I'd go chasing after...plus the price is a bit high-$8 a bomber-...for something that I feel that the hype here is more than it deserves. A decent beer but the hype (in my opinion) is greater than the beer. This is one that I'll not be buying next year...not that its bad, but it just isn't worth buying again..."
"Drinkability - This beer is quite dangerous in the drinkability category. Goes down way too easy for an 11%. I've had a bomber of this in a sitting and would easily have another if weren't so strong. A great beer and one of my favorite seasonals."
"Pours a nice bright red looks like watered down pomegranate juice. With slight wispy white head that flees the scene very quickly. Smells like sweet cherries and sweet malts. Not too much in the nose, but nice. Taste is a pleasant caramel malty backbone with a cherry boozy finish. It's kind of like cherry bounce in a beer bottle. I don't know if that's good or bad, but I kinda like it. Very strong beer, but with that tartness/malty combo it kind of smooths it out. Pretty nice brew overall, kinda wish it had a bigger mouthfeel just to round out the beer. A little heaviness would go a long way, but it's a good brew for sure. Hops? what hops? did they use them? I can't tell, didn't come up this time around. Nice holiday beer would definitely try again, the nice booziness will help around the holidays, I hate egg nog."
"Mouthfeel is crisp, light. Medium bodied, but maybe somewhat too light for the style. It's very drinkable - the sweetness does not get old. Alcohol content doesn't hinder, either. Very refreshing, very enjoyable. A nice 'holiday' beer from a great brewery."
"D: Not bad, a tasty brew."
"D: It was very good and smooth on its way down. I'd definitely have it again, but not sure that I would pick it over some other holidays I've had."
"D- Not that high for me. I've tried this occasionally through the years trying to find something new but this beer never wowed me. It's a decent BSDA but if your looking for a christmas style brew with a nice spice factor look elsewhere. The alcohol completely gets in the way of the cherry and honey additions. I'm not sure if aging this would do any good either."
"A very Christmassy brew this. Very fruity, which makes some sense with a rich cherry aroma, but with something else as well - a wheaty twang in the nose. Sweet, rich and flavourful for sure. Alcohol is well hidden, but still manages to give a hint of complexity. Very fruity and nary a hop to be tasted - well maybe a bit in the finish, but this is a big, malty, fruity brew. Color is an appropriate copper, and carbonation a bit muted. Soft, creamy body is nice as well. As for the honey... well, I don't taste it. I suppose the cherry is that much stronger a flavour. Pretty drinkable for a big beer. Worth trying, but like most fruit beers, not a regular in my beer fridge."
"Mad Elf makes for a fine winter beer, worthy of sipping by the fireside with dessert and my lovely wife. And yes, I will have another please."
"Dark garnet in color with no head (this is just because of the way the beer was poured, I think). A dark cherry flavor apparent in the nose becomes more prominent when tasted. Full-bodied and malty -- a very unique brew. Almost like a Belgian winter warmer (but no obnoxious spices; the cherry flavor works very well). Very easy going down despite the high alcohol content."
"D: I'm usually not a big fan of the taste of spiced or fruit infused beers, but this is a nice balance. It is a bit sweet for me, but not nearly as sweet as many of the belgians I've had lately. I will probably make this part of my holiday beer mix next year."
"rDev: +3.2%"
"Interesting beer. Got this as an extra in a trade - thanks jophish17! Nice dark amber color, not much head, and no retention. Aroma is a little sour to me - maybe a bit too much sweet fruit - almost like bananas. Taste is similar but definitely better - smooth and sweet - a little spicy, which I definitely like. I can't believe that the alcohol is 11%. It tastes like 5-6%. I would've liked a little more alcohol presence in the taste and aroma. Feel is smooth - goes down nicely and I could drink several if I had them. Definitely an interesting take on a Belgian strong ale - the alcohol is a little too hidden for my tastes."
"Medium body, with lower fine carbonation. A bit of warming from the alcohol. Very interesting and enjoyable."
"Pours a reddish brown with a slight beige head which quickly fades to nothing. Aroma of Cherries and possible milk chocolate. The taste is a slightly sour cherry which quickly becomes strong cherries then a pleasant malt and spice finish. The beer leaves a thin syrupy (but pleasant) residue. This is a fine beer but I never crave more than one."
"Overall: An interesting take on Belgian Strong and a Winter Seasonal. Worth a try just for the banana bread."
"D-Suprisingly drinkable at 11%abv. Could drink a couple of these brews without much problem at all."
"Drinkability: I didn't smell or taste the high ABV, which I usually find very noticeable. Dangerously drinkable. Couldn't finish it fast enough. I really wish I had another right now."
"D: The taste was a bit off, to me. I was expecting more, but wasn't impressed overall. The carbonation was lacking and the beer was way too sweet for my taste."
"D- highly recommended..Rather pricey (52.00 for a case) one of those beers that you buy around the winter holidays too heavy for a summer drink"
"Ruby colored with a stout white head. no retention on the head. smell is malty with a tart note of cherries. taste is all malt with little hop backbone. somewhat tart, but those cherries really shine through. deceptively easy drinking for 11%. mouthfeel is really smooth, with enough carbonation to carry that heavy booze away."
"D: A great seasonal beer. It warms you up inside and makes you feel all warm and cozy inside. Perfect for cold winter nights. I couldn't drink more than one of these at a time, but I definitely want to pick up at least one more of these for when a winter storm rolls through. I think it would be great to sip this while watching the snow fall outside. A perfect beer for the season! I poured the bottle into a pint glass, but I think a snifter or tulip would serve as a better glass for this type of beer. The warmth and complexity of the beer really shine through when the beer warms up a bit."
"D: great beer, but I'd stick with one for tonight."
"The alcohol seems to be well hidden but I'm waiting for it to sneak up on me."
"Very nice little treat."
"One friend said the words ""Cherry cough syrup"" and once I heard that, I couldn't stop thinking it. Had a nice, creamy, full bodied mouthfeel but the alcohol was very present. Somewhat yeasty/spicy throughout. Interesting to try, but certainly a sipper for the cold months."
"A sipper to be had all night."
"From tasting notes 1/4/2009"
"If you can stand to let it age, it only gets better. I'm tempted to crack into my few remaining 2006 bottles but willpower has held out so far."
"An original and well made beer!"
"Mouthfeel is medium and drinkability is decent, but the noticeable alcohol kills it a bit for me."
"This is way too drinkable, as showcased by several of my friends after dropping back 3-4 pints in the afternoon. ""HAPPY"" New Year!"
"I doth blame Kendo for making me drop $20 on a six pack of candy with alcohol. Poured into a tulip glass an almost bright orange with little carbonation and little head, it packed a lot of taste into each sip, which made it tough to drink more than one at a time. It will probably age well, but I didnt have any interest in keeping it around until next year..."
"D: a very nice brew, especially aged. Fresh is awesome as well, but I wanted to see where it would go after a year. 11% is up there but it is a great seasonal beer for the winter as it is very warming."
"Dark ruby red, beguilingly opaque with a simmering white ring of head that holds steady when the glass is swished--intimidating... robust floral aroma with pine accents and cinnamon present as well--some fruity esthers join in... smooth--and slightly oily--light on the tongue, with little aftertaste that barely qualifies this as medium-bodied... approached bourbon in taste, sweet and malty at the throat but consistent and respectfully fruitful at its midpoint... WHERE is the 11% ABV?! this being brother Bob's gateway beer to the level above Miller Lite, Mad Elf continues to warm and wow--an instant mood uplifter without gimicky injected flavors or false advertising--as easy-drinking a winter brew as I have found, deserving of its big things in little packages moniker..."
"This seems worth cellaring for a year or two. Right now it's a decent beer, but with time and mellowing I bet it would be an orgy in your mouth. Right now it's just too hot for my taste. Still, a worthwhile contribution, even if I didn't like it as much as I wanted to, from a brewery I'm beginning to think I should regard as preeminent."
"The drink is medium in body with fine carbonation and good drinkability. The ABV is monstrous but well-hidden in this tasty little holiday treat. Many thanks to fellow BA Cindirene for the bottle!"
"This is a tasty brew, and I'm quite glad to have had the opportunity to try it."
"I'm not much of a Belgian fan but picked this one up because it looked interesting to me and I'm not disappointed."
"D - A sipper... A terrific holiday brew to quick back and relax with once everyone else is in bed and you're alone staring at the Christmas tree... Great craftsmanship... Another winner from Troegs..."
"this strong beer is from pa and that makes me proud. it taste like a beer from easton, but unlike the beer i wont mention , this one doesnt give me a head ache. mad elf is seasonal so get it if you can find it. its worth seeking out and the price is low considering it is on par with beers imported from euroland."
"Cheers!!!!"
"Beer has lost that dominant cherry taste. Still hot, however, and still a nice fizzy feel. I'd probably give it all 4's a year out. . . ."
"Poured a copper red color into a Sierra Nevada hop tulip glass. Head was about a finger-width and slightly off-white and settled to a thin cap which was thicker towards the wall of the glass. Aroma is malty with sweet dark fruit, banana, raisins, dark caramel hints. Mouthfeel was full and slick, with great carbonation which balanced the heavy feel perfectly. Taste was very complex with dark fruit, figs, raisin, malty sweetness, some banana, and an alcohol warmth and an almost port-like smoothness to the finish. Drinkability was moderate, due to the high ABV which was balanced well in the drink but definitely had a presence in the taste. Shouldn't drink one of these too fast, as my father-in-law unwittingly found out tonight. Overall this is a great beer, and the experience was made more enjoyable by the fact that I tried it with family on Christmas Eve. This could become a holiday staple."
"This is certainly a unique offering from Troegs and I really enjoyed it. A tasty holiday sipper to enjoy this Christmas eve."
"D: I really like this brew, but its a bit of a sipper for me. The lack of carbonation, strong spicing, and high ABV make me go a bit slow."
"Not the most christmas-like beer i've ever tried but a damn good beer nevertheless. Feels a bit like a barleywine with added spices. Why didn't i bring a few more bottles home with me..."
"D - Very good Christmas beer, well earned reputation"
"Recently sampled a 10oz of the 2008 Mad Elf....must say that this could be my favorite winter beer yet this year (or perhaps I'm only partial to the good folks from central Pennsylvania). Deep red coloration with a wonderful, complex taste (love the chocolate malts) that delivers a real kick. Would drink more if I did not need to drive home!!"
"Overall, this is a pretty solid beer. It probably won't make you blow your load but it's tasty and worth picking up if you can get it."
"Still have a couple more, thank God!"
"D- without being a dick, i'm glad i didn't save this elf til christmas eve. more than subtle, the special ingredients were totally subdued and could have been achieved merely with the magic of yeast, malt and hops, and a lil bit of rock candy. im treating it more like a generic wine than a really good belgian."
"Drinkability is high considering the strength."
"Medium body that coats the Mouth with it's honey goodness. I could drink this all night and that's why this beer scares the he'll out of me."
"Pours a clear red brown with a smallish off white head that disappears quickly. Smells of Cherries, plums, dried fruit, malt, spicy yeast. Tastes of cherry and sweet malt, a bit of alcohol, some yeast funk. I'm not picking up much at all in the way of hop aroma or taste. This bottle is over a year old, so I think what little hop it had has long gone. Body is medium to thick, Mouthfeel is syrupy sweet, carbonation is low. The 11% is well hidden with only a trace of alcohol in the taste. I found it to be a sweet Belgian dark and had to sip this one most of the way down. Not bad, but a bit sweet for my taste, maybe a bit more hops could have helped this one out. I hope to try one fresh someday."
"A mellow sipper, pretty good, not in your face. Still with that said, I think a couple years in the cellar would improve the overall flavor."
"This was my third and final attempt at trying to figure out why people seem to enjoy this beer. That being said it poured a nice copper red into my glass with a one finger white head. The smell was mostly alcohol with a hint of cherry. The taste, for me, was lacking. It says right on the bottle ""ale brewed with honey and cherries"". Not typically a phrase that leads me to purchase a beer but I've had some great brews that were made with cherries. This is not one of them. The cherry flavor is weak and seems artificial, like Ludens Cough Drops. I know this is not a sour but I'm still underwhelmed. Mouthfeel and drinkability are low due to the medicine/alcohol traits. Overall,the third time wasn't a charm. Although it did get a little better each time it never turned into a good beer. Being from Pennsylvania I did want to like this beer but it seems to me it's all hype."
"The ABV is well hidden, but this is a bit much to be that drinkable. To me it gets cloying and a bit too fruity if not sipped. Good fun, though. A cheerful beer."
"The drink hides the alcohol well."
"Dark ruby red with a 1.5 finger head. The head lasts under a minute and there is no lacing. The aroma is of alcohol, sweet malt, and light fruits, mainly cherry. There is some sugary sweetness in the aroma which I attribute to the honey. Flavor is sweet honey initially and the alcohol is noticeable. There is a medicinal quality that I can't quite put my finger on. I like the cherry flavor. It's not overdone and adds a nice and subtle fruitiness to this already sweet beer. Medium - full bodied with okay carbonation. Definitely a holiday beer."
"D - of this beer is not the highest. The taste is a little bit on the sweet side, so one at a time is enough. Still, it is good and even better as the glass progresses, and it's putting me in a festive mood."
"Notes: Glad that I bought the six pack. When I go back to Heinen's I will look to see if they have any more. In a blind taste taste I would readily believe that this is a true Belgian. Troegs is 2 for 2 with me so far as I had their Hop Back a few weeks ago and it was excellent."
"A very interesting take on the style. The alcohol is well hidden. This would make a great crossover beer for those who like red wine."
"	I picked up a case of the elusive Mad Elf the weekend before the Thanksgiving holiday. I'm now down to my last two, less the six pack I'm cellaring for next year, and figured it's time to put finger to keyboard and write a few words. I poured a 12 oz. bottle into my crystal snifter with enough force to create a nice inch thick head. It quickly dissipated, and left a nice bubbly ring around the inside of the glass. The aroma was heavenly; the bold richness of a strong Belgium dark ale with dates and figs, mixed with the tart sweetness of cherries and honey. Upon first taste there is a detection of dark fruits, such as dates, raisins, and figs. Afterwards the sweetness of the honey and the cherries tartness come through. The Mad Elf is a bit lacking when it comes down ""mouthability"". There is a deficiency in carbonation, which is one of the hallmarks of most strong Belgium dark ales. Overall it is still a very enjoyable beer and definitely one to keep a look out for this time of year."
"D: Excellent with a heavy meat or ice fishing for that matter. I want to try this from a bomber and let it breath to see if the flavor has more complexity beyond the cherry's and malt bombs I'm still tasting ten minutes after finishing this boy."
"D- Troegs did a great job of covering up the alcohol and making this beer not too heavy so I could drink a lot of this, however, the taste is too muted for the style and left me feeling unsatisfied."
"Wine Specialist/22 oz/$7.49"
"Interesting but not a beer I would grab again."
"This beer pours a dark amber to almost crimson red color. The aroma is malt and cherries but the cherry aromoa is faint to me. As far as the flavor I agree with the cough syrup taste however it is not a bad thing as I think of it more as a fruit backing of cherries. Overall I would not drink this beer on a regular basis however this is a great beer for an occassional quaffing!"
"the bottle version of this is also slightly different, although i would need to have a taste of it, as i haven't had the bottled version in about 2 years..."
"For 11% this guy is pretty drinkable. I enjoyed taking my time with it."
"Poured into a westmalle chalice a dark amber with a very small head that disapated quickly. Smell is very sweet, with a very small hint of alcohol. The sweet cherry taste hits you up front, with a mellow sweetness from the honey that follows. Very malty with very little hop bite to it. Carbonation is just right. Very smooth beer for 11%abv. Overall, the cherries bring a very unique flavor to this style beer. A flavor I think I like."
"Taste & mouthfeel: Malty sweetness paired with fairly reigned-in fruity esters. Cherry is evident in the taste but actually well balanced with the malt, more a subtlety than a dominant flavor, lending a mild tartness as well. This tastes like a bastardized Belgian quad. Some spicy phenols appear in the finish. Very medicinal and cough syrup-like. Bitterness is non-existent. Pretty tough to drink, not my favorite Troegs beer by a long stretch."
"Had a 2008 bottle this evening and it is drinking very well at the 2 year point. High ABV is simply warming ans slightly sweet and cherries have become more forward. This may be one that gets a sixer in the cellar every year."
"Nice looking red color, tinge of brown, small white head. Looks a bit like cherry soda. The smell is classic belgian ale: yeasty, spicy, corinder, orange peel. Maybe a little candy sugar, but not much cheery or honey. The flavor is malty, sweet, sugar, vaguely fruity. Definitely a little honey in there. Good finish, nice hop sting on palate, which endures. Not bad, not as good as I had hoped. Certainly drinkable; in fact, it's hard to believe it's 11% ABV."
"I doubt I would drink this on a regular basis, but as an occasional drink, it works great for me. It's almost like a weaker version of a barleywine. Even though it is a BSDA in the database, it doesn't taste it at all. Then again, people also say Jager tastes like cough syrup, and I have no problems with that, so maybe it is my palate. Even though it is a winter release, the strong fruit presence would make this a pleasant treat in the summertime."
"Drinkability: is up there but i wouldnt go hog wild"
"Light on the tongue and easy to drink with no alcohol burn, this is one smooth operator for its ABV. Sort of like a mild-mannered relative of Three Philosophers."
"Pours a nice dark amber with a slight white head. Aroma of cherries, honey and alcohol. Although the abv is 11% the alcohol is masked very well making this a smooth beer. The cherries and honey give this beer a nice sweetness that is balanced out by a slight maltiness."
"Drinkability: Tastes good, has good mouthfeel, and goes down well. Good enough for me"
"Wtf this is a weird one. Had at the Tap and Mallet in Rochester. It's sort of a mix of a hefeweizen, belgian, and american amber. Really big banana and clove notes.. almost sickening, with a good amount of unfermentables underneath providing it with some sweetness. Nice orange color with good lacing. I had to give half the beer away because I couldn't finish it.. it was just too wacky. I'm not a Belgian expert, but I've had Chimay before and know what I look for in the flavor from the yeast and this just went way overboard IMO. It's probably not a bad beer, but it's just not for me."
"Ruby red syrup turns pomegranite booze. No head, low carbonation. Copper oil washes in powdered sugar, giving way to a collage of incoherent flavors. Cherries, plums, honey, and rum clash to create Robitussen. Sweet turned skunked Leffe Blonde. Quite gross."
"Pours a dark red color with no head to speak of which is quite a turn-off. The scent makes up for dull appearances with a strong cherry, sweet aroma. There's some false advertising going on here, the cover is way more pleasant than the book. An initial stale fruit gives way to rotting plums and cough medicine. Don't get me wrong, there's a ton of flavor here but I can't imagine a palate that would enjoy this for more than one sip. Either this elf really is crazy or I've been bad all year cause he just brought me coal in a bottle."
"Tasted like a common dark belgian witha faint cherry sweetness. It has a meade-like viscosity and leaves a coated feeling in your mouth, which is where the honey really shows through. Not much aroma, just a hint of sweetness. Its ok, but nothing amazing."
"This is a great sipper. Something to hold and enjoy the evening with. It is so very smooth and easy to drink that at 11% abv I could easily ruin the next morning if I am not careful."
"M + D: A nice sipper, well suited for a cold winter evening. Rather crisp, which is nice for a bigger ABV brew. A nice medium body, with that snap of carbonatio. You'll certainly feel it, but it'll go down without much troubles!"
"Mad Elf's a unique Christmas release. I can't think of any others off the top of my head anything like it. All of the happy elves are primarily winter warmers, but Mad Elf is one pissed off, spicy Belgian ale. Gotta love that. It's a good beer and I have no reservations recommending it. The nose could use a little work. That's it's only notable flaw."
"D_The cherries are a bit too strong here and make the whole beverage a bit cloying. If there was a bit more sourness I like this better. That said, this is probably what they going for and this is clearly a well made brew. For a brew of this strength the alcohol is almost completely hidden."
"Pretty drinkable for 11%. Would have guessed more like 9 or even 8%."
"For American brewed Belgian ales there are better options but this is worth trying."
"I look forward to this one every holiday season, then I may only have one or two. 11% for this one is a bit scary, but all in all, it's a nice beer."
"D: This is an amazing beer. I could drink it all day long although at 11% I would be surely drunk by the end of that day."
"Interesting brew for the holidays. Recommended."
"Serving type: bottle"
"3.1/5"
"The mouthfeel is nothing special really; somewhat thick and a bit syrupy. All-in-all, I'm somewhat disappointed after hearing all of the praise. Certainly not bad though."
"D- Very good beer. I don't think that I've had a beer with this high an ABV that I felt that I could drink multiples without a problem. Although, you probably shouldn't drink much more than a single."
"D. Very easy to sip on. Seems to taste well with just about any food."
"Pours a pretty ruby red color with a smallish egg-shell colored head that settled into a ring. The aroma is yeasty and sweet. Some banana and bubble gum aromas as well as some earthy spice. The taste is a subdued version of the aroma; some banana and bubble gum. What is different is the honey and the cherry, more so on the cherry. Slight hint of hops in the end. The feel is a tad thin for such a sweet brew, it has prickly carbonation to prevent it from becoming sticky or slick. The honey adds a nice smooth feel. Alcohol is scarily well hidden. Quite a good BSDA, I appreciate that it strays away from the red wine flavors that most BSDAs do have."
"Overall not a bad beer, but not what I was hoping to get into. A little bit rough on the sweetness and just not enough balance and tart fruit flavor to counteract it. Still though a solid effort and not something I would turn my nose up at if offered."
"Pours a nice copper with a thin white head. Good retention and nice lacing. Aroma is of sweet cherry,honey and dark fruit. Body is medium with some carbonation. Taste is of sweet ripe fruits with cherry up front. Bread and honey in the finish. Excellent!!"
"This is a good American-made Belgian-style ale. Still, it could do more to stand out in a crowded field. At no point did I think that it was particularly unique or interesting. The cherries are a nice touch, but they aren't prominent enough to really give the beer much character. All that being said, this is still a solid beer, and I recommend it to anyone who enjoys the style."
"Taste: Sweet and malty with some maraschino cherries in the background. A bit of alcohol. Nice dry finish."
"pours a reddish color with no head at all. minimal carbobation. aroma of cherries and honey heavy throughout. Taste is tad malty, syrupy with cherries and honey. Goes down really smooth, a really really good beer. Wouln't be able to drink many 11%abv. I gots a buzz already."
"Easily drinkable. Dangerously so, given the ABV of this beer. Could make for a very warm and fuzzy holiday evening."
"Drinkability- For something this alcoholic and warming. I could see myself attempting to put down a whole six pack. I doubt if I could get the whole way through them, but I sure as hell could try."
"Very delicious brew!"
"Edit: This beer becomes so much more with a year on it. A little too messy fresh, but it melds well with age."
"D- Overall, not my personal favorite, but not a bad beer by any means. Troegs doesn't disappoint with this one, and offers a dangerously easy drinker that, at 11%, could definitely get you in some trouble!"
"Drinkability: My first in the Belgium styles. Very pleasant tasting beer. I will definitely make this an annual purchase. Another good beer from Tröegs."
"Na Zdravje!"
"It's got a spicy nose from the Belgian yeast and it finishes smoothly for an beverage with 11% ABV. The sweetness and alcohol hide any hops or yeast notes."
"D - With the alcohol not coming through too much it makes this a very enjoyable beer...but watch out for that 11%!"
"D: See above!"
"D- undecided on this one, but the amount of alcohol in this it wasn't very noticeable which could make this a really good winter warmer to enjoy at home on a cool evening.."
"..."
"This poured a clear auburn with a bit of light tan head. It smelled like lots of sour cherry, almost tannic like a red wine, with lots of wild yeast, and some burnt barley hops and molasses. It tasted like potent and succulent sour cherry with wild honey malt and lemon hops. As it warmed, the taste of wild yeast became more and more prominent. It was quite thick with no carbonation, and had a lasting tart aftertaste. Overall this was a very flavorful beer, reminiscent of Three Philosophers. It had that unique cherry Belgian flavor that takes a while to get used to, but can be fairly enjoyable. It definitely had clean taste and great body. Most notable was how well it hid the 11% alcohol, which I could barely notice under all that cherry and yeast. If aging this beer brought more honey sweetness to balance the cherry and yeast, this could be a fantastic drink."
"I tried an aged 2007 and there is quite a difference. All that booziness is gone and it is quite a smooth drink with a year on it."
"I poured a 12 ounce bottle into a tulip glass. This elf pours a pleasant shade of red with a small white head. The 11% ABV is obvious from the smell. The alcohol is overpowering with a hint of cherries. The taste is a bit to medicinal, the cherries are present, but are overpowered by the alcohol. The beer is a bit of a sipper, medium bodied and lots of alcohol. I was a bit disappointed, there were a few threads singing its praises, but for me it did not measure up."
"D: This is a strong winter warmer. Too sweet to drink all night. Overall, an interesting brew but I'm not sure I'd seek this one out on my own accord."
"If you enjoy winter seasonals, cherries, and good strong beer, this 11% ABV brew is a definite must!"
"D: Definitely interesting and tasty. I would have liked to see a more pronounced spice/hop presence to balance out some of the sweetness, but it's still a very nice winter offering."
"D- A nice relaxing brew. This will knock you on your ass but you wouldnt know it from the taste. Goes down smooth and clean."
"Pours a clear reddish color with no head sticking around when I find my chair. Smell is fruity, and I'm getting a bit more yeast out of this than I was expecting. Taste is very nice. Incredibly smooth and non-cloying. Plenty of cherry flavor makes this very enjoyable. You have no idea while drinking this that it is 11%. It is so easy drinking that you must force yourself to make it a sipper. Can't wait to pick up some more of this to drink throughout the holidays."
"D- Initially I never bothered to look at the ABV % of this beer. Now I know why I had slight buzz. At 11%, this beer far from sessionable, but still a very nice brew for the upcoming holiday season."
"MF&D - I think it would be little tough to drink this all night."
"Flavors start out very sweet and sugary with notes of cherry syrup, apricot, clover honey and pear. Transitions nicely into a slightly tart black cherry, currants and alcohol finish. Would be a great holiday brew in the dead of a nothern winter to warm up the innards."
"D= probably one or two per sitting is all I could handle as far as ABV. Otherwise very drinkable. A definite must-try if you have the opportunity. Buy a few at holiday and stock them for a few years later for a great celebration."
"D- It goes down fast. A really good beer for cold months. Enough fruit to surpass any cloying sugar that might've been left behind."
"D: A high ABV of 11% keeps this from being a session beer obviously, but it is a great holiday beer."
"Pours a dark ruby color, good clarity, with a nice solid half inch of off-white head and little sustain. Aromas of dark candy sugar, Belgian like esters, light fruity and floral notes, an indication of the cherry and honey additions. Lots of bubblegum too, perhaps a colaboration of all the esters and fruit additions. On the palate, a thickly complex Belgian dark combined with the cherries just hits you everywhere. It's not overly sweet, but has a cherry cough drop like flavor. This one really reminds me of Three Philosophers, but slightly more interesting and drinkable."
"2006 was better then the 2007, I can't wait to get my shipment of 2008 in this year."
"2007 release. Pours a murky copper, bordering on red. Thin wisp of a head disappears almost instantly, leaving no lace behind. Cherries, dark fruit, spice and honey on the nose. A bit of warming brings the honey characteristic to the front. Cherries & honey are the main flavors, along with plum, raisin, licorice, and belgian yeasty spice. Medium body, crisp carbonation and a bit of alcohol sting. Considering the abv, I expected more pungency in the flavor and aroma. But the lightness in the body and crispness, along with the fact that the abv barely shows itself in the flavor, gives it dangerous drinkability. Enjoyable, for sure."
"overall, dangerously drinkable."
"Drinkability: A fairly pleasant beer that definitely hide the alcohol well, and, as this was a 2006 bottle, I'll go ahead and declare this to be a mighty fine candidate for aging."
"I love this beer because of it's simplicity. Cherries + Honey + Alcohol. It's as simple as that and it's a credit to the well balanced nature of this, that it doesn't come out tasting like cough syrup. It's all so smooth and easy on the palette, that the ABV of this can creep up on you very unexpectedly. Packed with festive flavors and toasty feel, this is a perfect for the holidays or anytime your looking for a warm and flavorful pick-me-up from a beer."
"Too sweet to be really drinkable to me."
"Belgian spicy aroma. Creamy mouthfeel. Fruity with a sour finish. Yeasty and sour. Lacey. Tinged colour. Winter in June.Sweet and sour and in need of food to separate out the taste directions. An extreme and a different from this brewer.Alcohol warming but no warning it was this high. RFD."
"Send me some more, somebody! :)"
"Flavor was full-bodied with notes of cherries, sweet malt backing with little to no hop presence, the finish was very robust with a spicy, alcohol kick. The alcohol is pretty much in your face throughout the beer."
"D - Having brewed a few honey beers before I think this combination plays nicely. Easy to drink for 11%."
"A quality Belgian Strong from Troegs. Balanced and pretty easy to drink for a big beer."
"Drinkability: Enjoying this so close to summer was no problem for me. A very solid beer worth enjoying yearly."
"Mad Elf turned that around for me. Pours and smells like one of those Unibroue ""ale on lee's"". Oh I like those. Their Terrible, maybe? Thick molasses, brown sugars, honey and the cherry, described on the bottle - stick out on this bad boy. Drinks well, some candied fruit tastes linger in there. I was sticker shocked to see it was 11% - well hidden."
"An addictive beverage that you want in succession."
"D: Drinks dangerously easy in regards to its ABV which could mean trouble and come back to get you in the end. Hopefully the sweetness would limit multiples as the alcohol is not a factor upfront."
"This beer is nicely balanced with a good flavor. I could easily make a session of this beer."
"This is a very interesting and complex beer. A very enjoyable drinking experience. Definetly something different - just not my favorite flavors."
"D: You could definitely get drunk from a few of these. Not a bad beer, but I think there are better drinks out there."
"Notes: I swear if I tasted this blind, I'd think it was brewed by Dragonmead. It's an interesting brew, blending interesting tastes, but I won't go out of my way for it. It's a great try tho."
"This is a good beer, and one I'd recommend picking up if you see during the holidays - perhaps my score doesn't do it justice. If I see it again, I definitely will be - I think aging could do a lot for it."
"D: Sippable and worth lingering over. Having had this a couple times now, I can say I've enjoyed it. Doesn't 'wow' with huge complexity like it's Belgian counterparts, but the cherries and honey are interesting. Worth recommending and one we'll have again, I'm sure..."
"all three get much better as they warm up and the flavors open up even more. this beer (regardless of the year or age) is fantastic. i have been a fan of Mad Elf since the first time they brewed it. If i were to pick which i liked better, i would probably go with the most current. while the older ones mellow, the newest one has a much stronger flavor. the cherries are more aparent and the other subtle flavors shine through more prominently."
"Although this is my first bottle of this one, comparing to other reviews I get the impression that when young it is a bit too alcoholic, improving with time. I am not a big fan of cherries, but this one is very good."
"I think this might be a better brew, for me, without the cherries. I am not fond of the medincinal quality the fruit lended in this particular brew, i dont think the cherries did the belgian yeast any favors. just my opinion."
"This is not one of their best beers; average, yes, but not worth going out of the way for. Personally, I thought the elf more disinterested than mad. Sorry guys."
"For 11% abv this is amazingly easy to drink. A delightful mid winter treat and a really delicious nightcap. I will definitely be looking for this one come next Christmas."
"Pours a clear red/amber color with very little tan head and minimal lacing. Aroma is really strong, cherries, Christmas spices, raisins, alcohol, yeast, and a slight hint of sweet honey. Taste is very sweet and fruity, mixing bananas, yeast, coriander, clove, and sweet malt, with a slight note of cherries as it warms. Goes down smoothly yet with a stickiness, medium in body with good carbonation. Hides its 11% abv very well, but it sneaks up on you if you're not careful. One of the best reasons for the Christmas season."
"This beer was a beautiful dark crimson red with a nice 3/4 to 1 inch head of white foam. I thought the retention was OK because it only left behind some foamy white rings along the edge and a few spots of white lace. It had a pleasent aroma that contained some of the sweetest juicy fruits I've encounter in a beer so far. Behind these fruits was a splash of banana, a touch of yeast, and some subtle toasted malts toward the back. The taste was mostly fruity with juicy fruits. Once I got passed the juicy fruits, I discovered some bitter citrus hops, a splash of banana, a touch of yeast, and a small pinch of toasted malts in the background. The juicy fruits conquered all that were in its path! The mouthfeel was slick! There was no way I could tell that I was drinking a 11% ABV beer. There was no indication that there was that much alcohol in here. It did have an aftertaste, but it was short lived with dry citrus hops and lightly toasted malts. Yet another great beer from the Tröegs brothers! Just be careful with this one, it will sneak up on you!"
"Taste is enjoyably sweet and malty with a hint of spice from the yeast. Cherry is faint and hardly noticable. Goes down nice and smooth - not too sticky despite its sweetness. Overall, a nice winter beer. Great to drink after sledding, making a snowman or gathering firewood. I would drink this seasonaly. Nice work Troegs!"
"Poured from 12oz bottle(thanks ahatcher78). Poured a red ruby clear color with a thin white head. Smell is super sweet cherry bubblegum, corriander and a whiff of alcohol. Taste is cherry cough syrup with a sweet honey spice flavor and herbal alcohol finish. Mouthfeel is sticky and smooth. Its a very interesting beer but hardly a session beer more like an after dinner drink."
"D: The strong fruit flavor helps keep the alcohol from ruining it, but it's a slow sipper - and a one and done."
"Drinkability well lets say you could pound away a few of these but at 11% I wouldn't recommend it"
"Pours a cherry red/orange, clear. Head is good but dissipates very fast leaving next to no lace. The nose has alot of wheat in it, and some belgian spice. The taste is thin, but good flavors with alot of wheat flavor and alot of spice with the slightest hint of cherry. Smooth finish goes down nicely. The mouthfeel is a bit thin here, but overall good. Drinkability gets good marks, as the 11% is incredibly well hidden. Good brew, would be a good one for some session drinking during the winter. Thanks Heath."
"D. for an 11% ABV, the drinkability is rather good, smooth til the end, and then the alcohol starts to really come through."
"Pours a cloudy cider color with a fluffy white head. Nose is sweet malt, clove, and maybe some brown sugar with alcohol also present. Taste is a subdued belgian spice, with notes of caramel malt, honey, and fruit on the backend. Alcohol warmth at the finish is perfect for a January in Pennsylvania. Very smooth on the palate, and quite enjoyable overall. This is not really my style, but this brew is an exception. A little pricey for a case, but on-tap, it definately warrants a try."
"This beer goes from great to fantastic in twelve months."
"D- Cool idea, but a little too sweet for me. Alcohol was surprisingly well hidden."
"Though it produced only a thin cap of fine bubbles off a moderately hard pour, the beer itself was a clear, brilliant red. The head retention was decent, with a solid ring settling into place, and the off-white bubbles were a bit sticky and spotty. The nose was a combination of fruit and spices, backed up by a rich maltiness, with notes of banana, tropical fruits, and cloves. The taste was pretty good - very fruity, mostly juicy rather than dried, with lots of banana and berry, plus a pleasant bread character and a balanced spiciness. Full bodied with lightish carbonation that was well integrated into the texture. It was palate coating, yet just short of being sticky, with a mild warmth. Pretty good stuff overall and a tasty Xmas treat. I did find it just a little too sweet though."
"This is a very nice beer experience."
"I've heard a lot of good things about this unique and interesting brew, so I was definitely eager to try this sample from Troegs... Really loved their Dreamweaver Wheat, so I knew I was dealing with a high caliber brewing company... this is a very effervescent and eccentric brew... pours an amber reddish copper hue with minimal head... smell is very sweet with a noticeable alcohol tinge present... taste is likewise sweet, with sugars, cherries, and fruity flavors present... strong caramel and honey essence which presents a strong, but drinkable brew... as expected for an 11% ABV, the alcohol is present, but is pretty well-masked behind an interesting cornucopia of flavors... cherries really make their mark on this brew, and the fruity essence is certainly noticed... Good brew... Definitely recommended..."
"I rarely like Christmas brews, as I'm not a fan of most of the spices, but since this one is not really ""spiced"" I was very pleasantly surprised."
"D- This is my favorite winter seasonal so far. This is a twist on Belgian Christmas ales -most I have had experience with have a licorice or anise presence while this PA representation does not. This is a great ale by Troegs. The summer naked elf is similar to this one-but does not have the complexity."
"D: A fairly drinkable beer. Tastes great and goes down easy. While you cannot taste the alcohol, it can hit you rather quickly, so do not expect to sit down and slam back a sixer of these babies."
"I try at least one new seasonal brew each year and was glad that I tried this one. Appears heavy when poured, dense creamy brown head. Better described as a malt wine than a beer, smooth and mellow. Great for slow sipping with some friends by a fire on a cold night. Fruity but not too sweet and hits you with strong alcohol taste that dissipates after a few sips."
"·	Drinkability. Excellent, one I could enjoy for a session, minus the high ABV."
"Pours a beautifully ruby hued amber with a thickly spiced aroma that has a fair amount of yeasty funk lingering as well. Flavor is spiced like a winter warmer. I feel like I am diving into this at the wrong time. It needs to be snowing like hell with a fire nearby."
"Medium bodied with a bright crispness due to good carbonation. A bit of a matted lingering finish but not dry. Not much warmth at all despite the high abv (11%)."
"Pours a clean orange-ish/ amber color with a tan head. In the aroma, cherries and a small honey and alcohol hint. In the taste, honey/ more sugar thean clove, and sweet dark cherries. A smooth, medium bodied mouthfeel and a small honey and cherry mixture in the aftertaste. Good flavor, small alcohol in the nose, and quite easy to drink."
"Drinkability: Very good beer that is most enjoyable during the cold weather. Spicy and warming, this is a great winter seasonal. Slightly high ABV could limit how many you may want."
"Troegs makes some unique beers and this is one of them, cannot say this is a Belgian dark ale, I think of it more as an amber with a serious punch, color throws me off when looking at the beer style on here, recommended, not bad and not great either, but worth trying once at least"
"D: I only wish I had 2 growlers."
"Because it is over 11% alcohol, I might have this once in a while but I wouldn't constantly drink it. To me, the recipe is there if there was less alcohol (I'm just talking a percent or two - it would still be pretty strong). That is just my opinion."
"Pours a muddy, and murky brownish red color with a thin layer of light colored head. The head disappears to leave a thin layer with no lacing what so ever. Smell is of amber malt and dried cherries. Taste is sour at first, followed by a bitter sweet taste. Taste is strong on cherries, with a limited watery carbonoation. Strong warming alcohol presence as this one warms after a spell."
"It's very drinkable, which is extremely surprising for the alcohol content. The 11% makes it impossible to have more then a few, but this is definitely one to enjoy. I have and will recommend this to anyone who will listen."
"Pours out a hazelnut/maple syrup color with a still body and just a ring of white bubbles. Smells terribly grainy with tons of honey and cherry cough syrup. Candyish sweetness explodes in the nose. Tastes of, yes, candy sweetness, overripe fruit on the verge of rot, Belgian banana esters going wild, cough medicine, and hot alcohol. Mouthfeel is slick, viscous, syrupy, is harsh with bubbles. Drain poured this since I didn't want to get ROBO-FRIED. This is a prime example of an American craft brewery totally messing up a Belgian-style beer. I'd take a Bud over this, please."
"D: 1 of this style is enough for me, though this one is very tasty. 11% also restricts the possibility for a session, too. Easy of consumption still helps."
"D- High ABV limits the sheer volume you'd want to down, but as a sipping beer, the complexity and originality make it a winner."
"Pours a dark brown ruby with a one finger off-white head that fizzles down to a thin pillowy layer. Very nice color, but the lacing could use some help. Smell is big on honey, cherries, and yeast. Robitussin aromas make an unwanted appearance in the nose. Alcohol and some out of place banana show up as well. Sour cherries and a whole bunch of yeast up front followed by banana, ugh. Rich caramel with a spicey pepper warms the mouth. Booze from start to finish but it's much less noticable served a bit warm. Medium bodied with a cough syrup like texture. Carbonation that tickles the tongue. Nice holiday brew, but the bottle should probably be shared. Very powerful this Mad Elf can be, watch out!"
"D - Nice holiday ale that's quite unique and complex. The Belgian yeast blends nicely with the cherries, honey and chocolate malt. While the 11% ABV is well-concealed, this is a brew to sit back and appreciate during the holiday season."
"D - Okay I suppose, although I wasn't too impressed. I think I just bought into the hype a bit much, which one should never do. I doubt I'll seek another out, though I wouldn't turn one down if offred. Maybe cherries just don't belong in my beer. Recommended if that's your thing."
"D = I just found this a little too sweet and overpowering to want to drink much of it or to look forward to drinking it again."
"Pours a nice red/copper color, although with very little head and lacing. Has a nice scent to it, a very nice cherry aroma to go with the deep ale scent. Nice hop/malt mix with both the scent and taste. Very nice taste, one of the strongest ales I've had in a while while just hinting at the high ABV in the taste. Nice splash of cherry in the flavor without taking over. Not the smoothest, but that's to be expected at 11%. I will not have any trouble finishing the sixer. I may even get the large bottle to take back home for the holidays."
"Drinkability is pretty good though the 11% alcohol would limit me to two at a time."
"The only thing I would like to know is why isn't it bottle-conditioned."
"D: The drinkability is very good in a bad way. Because this beer is so thin it's very easy to down beer after beer. Hell mad elf is so thin and drinkable it could almost be a session beer. Overall not impressed."
"pours with little head, but the ring along the snifter stays present throughout. the amber color is deep and very red, while the nose has a strong alcohol scent emenating cherries and a slight maltiness. this is a think mouthy beer having an immense flavor, a very subtle cherry flavor that is not over bearing nicely balanced with hops. i really like this beer, and it will store!"
"Why write last remarks on this beer so early? I'll be back in 12 months. And probably 24. This is a 'Lost:Season 1' beer: total cliffhanger with a huge reason to believe it's going to be fantastic."
"This is a valient attempt at a new take on x-mas beer but I am not into it. I have been very impressed with the other Troegs beers I've tried, but find Mad Elf a little to close to Mad Dog."
"D - Still kinda finding my way in this category. Overall this beer is very solid and while I would have it again, I won't seek it out or likely drink more than one in a sitting and that's not because of the alcohol content which is well masked, but the fact that there are many more interesting brews out there to try."
"A crystal clear reddish brown color. When poured aggressively a faint wispy head formed and faded quickly. The smell is sweet and very coriander spice and fruity. Light-Medium bodied, the mouth feel is whoa fully under carbonated, but the spiciness and tingle from the alcohol keep things interesting. The spicy coriander cinnamon character is slightly overwhelming. I understand that its made from cherries. I am definitely not getting the dark fruit fig taste that i expected. Oh well, just another interpretation i guess. Give it a shot."
"Drinkability- This is a pretty interesting brew. I like the direction its headed but it seems to lose its way midway through. Id like to see a bit more balance to cut the sweetness. Definitely worth a try though and big thanks to ClockworksOrange for the opportunity!"
"Very drinkable - very warming - 3 beers and I wouldn't recommend driving! I was hoping I'd like it more, but it's ok. The more I drink, the more I like. It reminds me of a barleywine more than anything else."
"D: Deception is key here. Although the warming alcohol is there, I could happily drop many of these ina row. Couldnt be more appropriate for the holidays. My favorite holiday beer, taking over for Anchor Christmas. Not a fan usually of Troegs either, but this is really good. Gotta load up for 08."
"This beer poured a copper color with a thin white head which disappears quickly and leaves minimal lacing. The smell was a bit lacking. It had a very dominate sweet smell. The taste was of honey and not much else. I really expected cherries but in this particular bottle I had none. It wasn't bad but when I see cherries I expect cherries. The really good thing was the 11% ABV wasn't dominant. The mouthfeel was medium body with medium carbonation. Overall drinkability was fair. It would have been great had I tasted cherries. I'll have to try another bottle."
"Drinkability: Fairly quaffable at 11% ABV. Not heavy or overly sweat. In fact, not too filling despite above average gas content. My only complaint is that the beer does not exceed my expectations of a superb Belgian Strong Dark Ale or some of the ratings on Beer Advocate (3.5)"
"Drinkability takes a hit because of the fruit and alcohol becomes a little tiresome on the palate. Overall a nice little beer that is truly warming."
"Despite being in the wrong glass, this one was still pretty good. I tried to adjust the scores as if they were in the correct glass (I feel I have enough experience to be able to do this). Overall, it's a tasty beer with a lower amount of phenolic qualities, which is what I prefer. The alcohol makes its presence known though. Recommended (especially when it's in the correct glass)."
"This is a great spiced ale for the holidays. Not my favorite style of beer, but I think I knew that going into it. Honestly, I'd love to take a big IPA, like a Double Simcoe or a 90-Minute or a Two Hearted and mix it together with the Mad Elf to see what comes of it. I think it would make a fine combination. That said, this is a nice winter warmer. At 11% ABV, it'll do the trick. Enjoy around the fire place after a ski run."
"D - this is a very good brew, but 11% abv makes it a slow sipper."
"This is a really tasty beer, but as I said you must let it warm. It's the only way to let the flavor shine through the booze. It's a little rough around the edges, but the flavor is nice. The sweetness starts to get cloying, and I have trouble getting through more than one. Still, a tasty brew that is very nice around Christmas."
"I would definately drink this beer again. I will also be cellaring some of it for next year."
"Drinkability is fairly low, in spite of how much I really enjoy this special treat, as it's so thick and rich. You don't want to rush it, and you probably shouldn't have more then one, or maybe 3! That being said, when I lived in Pittsburgh and it was readily available, I pigged out on it more then once, and it still has a fond spot in my heart...So I'll say average."
"Overall I really enjoyed this beer, even though it is a little early to be drinking a Holiday beer, but there is not doubt this beer warms your belly with the spice flavor. I'm not a huge Belgian style guy, but I really really like this beer. One word sums up Mad Elf. YUMMY. Enjoy it."
"Despite the steep cost, I will be purchasing either a case or a sixtel of this one when it comes out the end of next month. This is a top-notch beer. I love it."
"I would buy this every season. quite a treat."
"Taste starts off with hints of toasted malts and moves quickly to cherry and tropical fruit sweetness with a tart edge. Detectable alcohol burn early on as well, which is not a good thing. Tart fruits and vinous flavors dry out early sweetness near the finish. Medium-full body dissipates in the finish with a shot of alcohol warmth. A little too ethanol-y. A pretty good beer up until the rough, boozy finish."
"A good beer, but not a great one."
"Lots of evaporating alcohol on the tongue and the chest. Medium bodied to slightly thin especially for the style. Some cherry, spicey, herbal, earthy belgian yeasty aspects. Nothing says ""stand out"" about this beer. Just seems like an everyday run of the mill American brewed belgian style beer. However it is not a bad beer by any means."
"This is still a pretty drinkable beer, but I think the 05 really benefited from the aging."
"*EDIT* Jan. 21,2010: Recently sampled perfectly aged 2007 batch and this brew is specatcular."
"Acquired in a trade with ThomasHardy. The beer pours a crisp red amber with a thin head that quickly diminishes to a ring. The aroma is dominated by cherries and sweet malts. The taste is an extremely unique blend of cherries, sweet fruits, and even a touch of caramel. The beer is medium bodied and the alcohol warms, but is altogether well hidden. I must say, this is a truly unique beer that can be enjoyed any time of year. I look forward to trying some next year and see if enjoying it in the winter makes it taste even better."
"The beer was thick enough to coat my mouth and keep the flavor long after each sip. Outstanding, I was really glad to have tried it."
"Nice carbonation carries it along, fairly easy to drink, but watch out, that elf looks pretty crazy."
"Thanks to FroggyFrog for the sample! Pours a clear amber hue with a fizzy, pale tan head of two fingers. Dismal retention and no lacing but thats forgivable given the ABV. Wild berry and tropical fruit phenols; more alcoholic than Belgian. Vanilla bean and toasted malt aromas in the background, with undertones of champagne yeast and honey. First sip is sweet with toasty pale malt, a touch of caramel, and some errant dextrins. A flash of zesty marachino cherry, reminiscent of a young Kreik. Subdued Belgian Phenolics are more tart than funky, and combines with the other flavors to mask the alcohol very well. The aftertaste is a little boozey, and further dries out the palate after the mild hop bitterness balances the malts. The mouthfeel is ultimately well-balanced, dancing from sweet, to tart, to dry, and finally a clean alcoholic heat with all flavors receeding- leaving no cloying or residual sugar. The medium-light body is well-attentuated and well-carbonated- thus giving the mouthfeel a light and spritzy character- capable of lifting the powerful elements displayed. Finishes surprisingly mellow, as the malt, alcohol and yeast profile seem to apex, then fade away rapidly leaving only faint white-wine notes on the tounge for the last few swigs. Solid drinkability given the high alcohol, and an impressive interpretation of the style."
"The palate is sweet and malty. Quite delicious if I must say. Like drinking candy. It starts off like what I can best describe as a hard candy, which then gives way to a note of alcohol before finally getting to the bready part. I'm really enjoying the whole thing. Honestly, the alcohol is barely there at this point. Mad Elf was worth the wait and I really wish I had bought more than one right now."
"Pulled this from the cellar (not remembering the style, only that it was a seasonal) and on the first sip, I thought I was drinking Chimay."
"The appearance was nice although the head did disapear quite quickly. The smell was hard to find but once found it was pleasent some bitter-esque qualities coming through the smell but overall nice. The taste was nice with a strong finish that stays on your tongue. The mouth feel was above average."
"D: Decent, but one bottle is enough. Worth a try."
"Thought I'd celebrate the end of winter with a 2006. Head's totally gone in a few minutes; looks OK otherwise. Not a lot of aroma left in this one. Tastes great all the way through; oogles of complexity, well balanced, nice carbonation, pleasant lingering finish."
"This beer is one of the few that I've tried that has a prominent aroma. It smells sweet, and of fruit, which since its made with cherries and honey makes sense. I wouldnt say its a smell that really reminds me of beer, but i do like it. It has this nice amber color with very little head. It has an almost sugary sweet taste, which is a little too sweet for my taste. It's worth a try."
"The beers a deep amber, with a thin off-white head. It smelled of fruit, although cherries and honey are used in the brewing, I couldn't say it was cherry. It tasted fruity, sweet and warm. It was smooth, not at all over carbonated. At 11% alcohol, I wouldn't drink too much of it."
"3.5-D-I would say drink this up soon.It may be how Ive taken care of them.My cellar fluctuates about 20 degrees over the year and they are stored in the dark."
"Drinkability: Unfortunately for my wife, my toilet, and eventually my liver, this is one damn drinkable beer. I could easily put back a full sixer of these in a session. Hopefully I'm done decorating the tree by then. ;)"
"The mouth is good, good carbonation and quite smooth and velvety on the tongue. I though it started a bit thin, but it was about right as it warmed. Overall, after letting it warm, this turned into a very delightful beer, and I have mad props to give to leftmindedrighty for the chance at this one. Cheers!"
"Drinkability: I enjoy these on nice cold winter nights. Warms you up while still managing to be sweet and drinkable."
"Not sure what to expect at first, but this sure smells belgian. Lots of spicey aroma up front. I'm used to this being in the paler belgians, but I guess this one might be in the middle. More spice (corriander? in the flavor mixed with the honey and cherries and a little earthy bitterness that blends with the fruit. This is certainly different. It kicks outs at the end with a cherry tang and a hint, albeit an unsubtle one, at the alcohol. Definately not my favorite, but I recommend giving it try. It's worth it."
"Mouthfeel-Just like the 2005, this tastes nothing like the aroma! Wonderfully sweet. The cherry flavors are there and the honey sweetness is the dominant flavor characteristic. Alcohol is noticeable, but warming with no sting. A nice froth on the palate sweetens it up and releases the alcohol a bit more. Finishes quite clean. This brew will give you a warm fuzzy. The 2005 I drank had aged for a year and really mellowed. This brew is good fresh and also ages well. Troeg's does it again! Cheers."
"D: A good change of pace for me with this brew as I would possibly only pull this out once a year during the holidays. Nice and warming in the chest with the high abv."
"D: Well made, the cherry is a nice component that adds strong character. I never imagined that this would pair well with a seafood dish, but it does and is worth a look."
"A very interesting unique beer. Could use better carbonation, less carbonation, to bring out more flavor."
"Overall/Drinkability - Definitely a sipper. A great warming brew that needs to be enjoyed slowly. This beer seems to be on the threshold of greatness, but needs a tad more character to really blow me away. Not my favorite offering from Troegs, but give it a try if you run across a single or sixer. I going to cellar the rest of this six pack and see what its like come Spring. Cheers!"
"D: Not as complex as I was expecting. Very smooth and easy to drink though especially considering the 11%. Good but not great."
"I had this on tap at The Drafting Room and liked it a lot but didnt review it so i bought a bottle to review later. This is in regard to that bottle: Pours cherry red wine-colored with a small thin white head. Fruity alcohol odor. Cherries pretty obvious on the nose in kind of a candy-like way. A ton of alcohol obvious in the taste at first but it ramps back a bit after a while. Cherries come through later, along with a heavy maltiness. Sticky syrupy mouthfeel. A sipper i think. Overall it's good but it was better on tap with a meal in front of me."
"Overall, IMO this is a mediocre beer, kind of gimmicky. Lots of marketing but little substance. Not recommended."
"Drinkability - Good brew though a bit sweet and not quite spiced enough for my liking. However, my wife who's less of a beer drinker LOVED it, so I recco this for all guys looking to get their wife to join them in a brew around the holidays. This will definetly put everyone in the holiday spirit."
"D: As good as it is, the alcohol taste and effect keep the drinkability lower than ideal. 1 or 2 at a time would be plenty. I probably only drink a 6 pack/year of this wonderful brew. Kudos, to Chris and John for creating another great product. I'm trying to get to the brewery when they have this in the tasting room."
"Drinkability: Anything with this much alcohol needs to go down slowly, but Mad Elf hides its strength well."
"D- It is a very interesting and different brew. I really like it and probably would get it if I could. It is nice and complex and a lot of different levels of flavor."
"($1.79 / 12 oz.)"
"An interesting brew - fruity and sweet. A slow sipper."
"Overall: Thanks go out to ggaughan for generously hooking me up above the agreed trade. This beer was good, and I am happy to have had the chance to try it."
"I have had this beer in the fridge for about a year and I figured tonight would be a good night to reveiw it and it seems as if several others thought the same thing. I will pick up some more of this beer the next time I am in Bristol, Va."
"D: I personally, am not too big of a fan of the spices in any beer (so pretty much, Ive never been too fond of Belgians), but I enjoyed this treat.The high alcohol percentage does hinder me from wanting to drink more than one of these in a sitting, but it does not stop me from wanting to revisit again. Find a Mad Elf for your self and enjoy!"
"Body is thinner than expected, yet a bit syrupy. Definately believe a little time in the cellar will help this one out. Right now one bottle is plenty, but with some age this should be even more enjoyable."
"Drinks really easy for the abv, something a little different, but 2 of these beauties & you're done, This took the chill off a brutal winterstorming evening & certainally got me in the holiday mood! This would work with turkey or fruitcake. Mad props to GnomeKing for this one."
"The boys at Troegs have been tweaking the recipe nearly every year since its inception, but it seems as though they have finally hit the consistency that they have been shooting for. The bottom line is, it's a great beer for an equally great season!"
"Poured this beer into a pint glass, first thing I notice was the glowing ruby red color and white head. Beer had a sweet cherry aroma with just a slight honey nose. First taste really got a lot of cherry not some much sour on first taste but more so as I drank. Slight alcohol warming. Not as much as I would have expected from an 11%. Very drinkable and a nice beer to warm you up with out being too overpowering."
"Pours a clear dark amber color, nice carbonation, small head, nice lacing afterwards. The nose is of sweet malts, grassy/wheat, dark fruits (Cherries), belgian yeast, and caramel. The taste is sweet/malty, grassy, with a slightly dry finish, ABV hidden very well. Medium body, a complex brew. Very drinkable, does not remind me of an Belgian Strong Dark Ale at all, more like a Strong Pale Ale or WeizenBock."
"D - Intriguing, a lot of sour characteristics that I didn't expect yet are still welcome"
"Not my favorite, but definitely worth a try. It definitely tastes like the holidays to me."
"D: Some age will help but right now it is too sweet. But a nice sipper overall."
"couldn't decide between 4.0 and 4.5 on the taste. I think I changed it about 4 times. I decided it was closer to 4.5."
"D: Very tasty, not filling at all, goes down very easily. I’m not sure how the high ABV gets hidden so well in a beer that’s as light as this one, but it makes this beer dangerously drinkable. This is an excellent beer. I enjoyed it quite a bit."
"Bottle courtesy of adrian910ss: Poured a medium amber color ale with a small foamy head with average retention and lacing. Aroma of light cherry with some subtle spices and sweet malt. Taste is semi-sweet with cherry and sweet malt. Body is a bit light but alcohol is very well hidden. I was probably expecting a bit much from this beer, which is far from being bad but just not as complex as I had hoped."
"D: This is one of my favorite beers. Highly recommended!"
"Thanks for the unique tasting beer Foxman!"
"12 oz. Bottle thanks to zrrbrrt. The bottle features an elf who looks like he got a little crunk before Christmas and brought the cherries with him. I poured this one into a Chimay glass and the head dissipated super fast. The color is red and reminds me a little of cheery 7-up (only a little). It smells slightly syrupy and sweet with hints of cherry. I can barely taste the honey but the cherries are there. This definitely feels like a sipper and is probably going to take awhile. A decent beer but i could not drink more than one in a sitting."
"I voted pretty high on the drinkinability because I think this beers presentation and overall experience makes it very good to drink for a good period of time."
"Great seasonal brew, but a tad on the expensive side. Poured out of the bottle aggressily into a tall glass unleashed a spicy aroma, and gave a nice thick 2 inch head, which quickly disappears. The high alcohol content is not overwhelming while enjoying the brew, but it will sneak up on you after a few. The cherry/honey/spicy flavor is one of a kind. It seemed to taste better after it warmed up a bit. I took a few out of the fridge and drank them at about 50-55 degrees - I would personally call this the ideal temperature for this ale. I will probably grab a few more cases before they are gone."
"Leaves some decent lacing but not as much as a real belgian..but other than that, this is a world class beer. Pours an amber/red color with a fast disapating head. Tastes of fruity plums, honey, and cherries. Finishes dry with a rummy note at the end. Is light and crisp and very hard to detect it's strength. Glad I got a case of this one."
"I really, really dig this ale. if the ABV wasn't so high, this would be a constant (as much as it could be, given it's limited run) for me. I don't know why people have said that this tastes like cough syrup, because I sure can't taste it."
"2006 vintage. Pours copper and clear with a small loose cream head that quickly recedes to a ring. Aroma shows some cherry, some tartness and behind this a deeper light sweetness. The alcohol is present in the aroma as a fairly rich booziness. There is a dry white wine character in the aroma as well. There is a mix of tartness and a light sweetness and cherries up front in the taste, followed by a nice breadiness and finishing with a slightly dry small alcohol bite. Body is fairly light and thin. The alcohol although present is fairly well balanced for its strength and its light body. Not something I'd drink a few of back to back, but I look forward to aging some and seeing how it develops. Nice festive beer, I enjoyed the tartness which mixed well with the slight dryness and alcohol in the finish."
"Deep amber color with a short bubble head that didn't last or lace. Now that I'm over my cold, I can pick up a whiff of cherry and some alcohol. The taste does have a bit of honey to it (as the label suggests), and that same cherry that was in the smell. The alcohol is pleasantly not overpowering, even at the advertised 11%, leading to a drinkable brew. It adds a touch of bitterness to go with the tart cherry and sweetish honey. Still, the aroma is a big part of this beer, so I'm glad I waited to review it at a time I could savor it."
"The pour into my La Moneuse glass raises a a lovely cream-tan one finger head that quickly falls to surface bubbles and a glass ring. It leaves some sparse and slick lacing when the glass is tilted. The beer's body is a slightly transparent cherry red, tinted gold just a bit. The nose is very forward with cherry and estery fruit notes, as well as strong yeastiness. There's a note of spiciness, which I know must come largely from the alcohol, but seems to indicate hops as well. The aroma doesn't exactly leap from the glass, though. The taste is at first very sweet and cherry flavored, but it quickly moves into a characteristic flavor of Belgian yeast. It then exhibits a distinct breadiness. It lingers in the mouth with an acidic bread note. Alcohol is well hidden, so long as you don't sip too much or too often. Considering this beer's heft, the mouthfeel is somewhat light, which makes it an easy drinker. Carbonation is slight, too."
"Very beautiful dark cherry color beer with a lot of alcohol (not surprising at 11%) in the nose along with dark fruits, cherry, fig. Very nice spicy character in the nose as well. Could not conjure up an head at all and no lace down the side. Very sweet oily character with cherry, and very sweet. Since I like sweet, no worries, but some would probably describe it as cloying. Strong yeast character as well. Hops is listed on the website as only 15 IBUs, which seems true with no hop character, so the yeast is the main component for the spicy notes. Very cool, fun beer with lots of character and punch. Not overly complex, but a very good beer overall."
"The 11% ABV is totally lost and hidden in here."
"Overall, very enjoyable. Kinda like a barleywine. A sipper for sure."
"Tough to down multiple glasses of this with the 11% ABV, but I'd never pass up a pint"
"This beer was from a 12oz bottle into a pint glass. Poured very red with not much head that didn't last long. the smell is malty with some spicyness to it - hard to describe for me. The taste is the same sweet, cherries, cinnamon. Mouthfeel is very dry. I like Troeg's beers a lot but this one is not a style I prefer. If you like a stronger holiday style beer then I imagine this would be great, just not my thing."
"pours deep red to mahagony forms little head at the top smells of spices cinnamon, nutmeg and hints of cherries tastes of holiday spices cinnamon, nutmeg, clove, and a subtle hint of cherries with alcohol present filles thinner in my mouth than i would expect and i dont know i believe one of these would do it for me very strong beer but very spiced if you liked holiday spiced beer this one here is the right beer for you"
"I would recommend this ale - but watch out as they pack a wallop"
"Drinkability: Easy to drink as the alcohol doesnt seem apparent but keep in mind that it is more so than others. Super clean finish and you get a pretty drinkable beer."
"Poured from a 12oz. bottle a ruby red with a small amount of head and scents of sweet fruit and alcohol taste has a bit of sweet cherries and honey with a backing of some belly warming alcohol. A winter warmer indeed but not an all night beer just a couple and I'm good. A great night cap."
"Another solid winner from Troegs, who never disappoint. This is one that I look forward to each winter, and this year is just as good as the others. Just be warned, sip them slowly.... the mad elf can quickly smack you around if you're not paying attention."
"The drinkability is high. Even at 11% ABV one is not enough. Prosit, MK"
"Never had more than one of these at a time due to high abv. Could see pushing the number higher though to trundle through the holiday season..."
"Chris & John - thank you so much for this wonderful selection!"
"Dangerously drinkable at 11% ABV. This beer has the characteristics of a monster tripel with just enough cherry and honey to add some additional complexity without becoming distracting. In my opinion, this is the best version of this beer to date."
"Overall- A nice sipping Winter Ale. 1 or 2 at the most will suffice. Good but not as great as all the hype!"
"A must try Christmas beer!"
"Overall: Given sufficient time to mature, this is one of the most drinkable, comples, and fun winter beers around. Tip of the cap to the Brothers Trogner."
"This beer is a big mangled wreck. All over the place. Perhaps the only aspect that makes me want to try it again is that it is so over-rated."
"Thanks to ski271 for throwing this in as a little taste of Christmas in June."
"A very good beer that is worth the hour and half drive across state lines to purchase. One that I will be looking forward to this coming holiday season."
"Thanks again to beerbeing."
"Good drinkability. I can see how this could be a holiday favorite."
"Drinkability: Not a bad beer for quaffing, although there are many better in the style, but this is a delicious beer, one worth trying."
"I will certainly look forward to Mad Elf in the coming holiday seasons."
" Now, while I absolutley love high abv Belgian Darks, I have to admit that I was a bit let down here. The Elf is dark, the appearance looks wonderful and the smell hints of spices of Thanksgiving and Christmas dinners. Albiet faintly, but they are there. From that alone I was thinking that this was going to be a treat. Alas, the mouthfeel was clean , but the taste seemed to be missing the spices. The alcholol wasn't that pronounced, which was good, but something was lacking overall. From the nose I'd be thinking of something Belgian. However, the aftertaste assures me that this is an imitation. All of that combined made me glad that I had crossed paths with this one at a local pub. I had almost purchased a case, ( Archaic Pa. LCB Law), prior to finding this one bottle. For the abv content the case cost was rather low. I should have known something was up. While the Elf is a far cry from being the worst, it's an even a further cry from being the best. A nice try by the Harrisburg brewers but, I wouldn't stick my neck out for this one."
"Thanks to my friend ""Grassy"" for a sixer of this hard to find nectar..."
"Clear, reddish tint. Half inch head that fades away quickly. Leaves some lacing on the glass. Smell of cloves and cherries. Rick taste- cherries, hints of some other fruit and a very mild astringent taste. Very rich, like a plum pudding run through a blender. Rich mouthfeel as well, very pleasant, no hint of the 11% abv until you reach the end. May have got a hint of alcohol taste by then. This is not a session beer. It goes down incredibly smooth but a second one, away from home, would not be a good idea for me. A great winter drink and a great nightcap."
"Flavor is strong in the spices. Cloves, cinnamon, nutmeg and a shot of pepper for good measure. Slightly malty sweet at first but then quickly followed by the spice. Bits of molasses and honey. Lots of heat from the alcohol. Enough to make this a nice slow sipping drink, like a scotch. Lighter mouthfeel than I was expecting but I think that was from the alcohol. A nice beer to drink one bottle of but more than one bottle is asking for a rough morning."
"Aroma is strong with cherries, malt and hints of nuts. Pour is amber/red with just a hint of a head. Flavor is nutty and malty with hints of fruit and sweetbread. Have no idea where they are hiding 11% alcohol. Tastes like 6% if that. Finish is the most cherry laden. A very interesting beer. Quite pleased with it."
"Reviewed from detailed notes. A gift of Higravity ala SS'05. Thanks so much for the opportunity! Poured a one-finger light tan head over a crystal clear light orange rusty liquid. Smelled of cloves, orange peel, coriander, and a phenolic edge. Tasted clovey phenolic. Syrupy sweet. Sharp belgian funk. Overall, clovey menthol. Md-light body that's somewhat syrupy. A decent winter warmer."
"Drinkability  A winter warmer through and through. Many characteristics that remind me of a barleywine. Tremendous and serious brew. Be careful, quite drinkable."
"This beer poured a cloudy amber color with little or no head. I'm guessing the 11.0% abv reduces the head and head retention. Aroma is sweet and reminds me of malt, sugar and spices. The taste is quite sweet also, with notes of candi sugar, malt, caramel and a very faint taste of cherries. The label on the bottle states that this beer was brewed with honey and cherries, but I can barely detect these ingredients. This beer reminds me of an English barleywine/old ale because of the overall sweetness and the light hop flavor. BA lists this as a Belgian Strong dark ale, but I wouldn't know in a blind tasting. This is an OK beer, but I probably would not buy it again."
"As it continues to warm, however, the beer becomes a bit cough-syrupy  too sweet and sticky in the throat. And the warmer it gets, the worse it gets. Even at 55 degrees, it's pretty awful."
"For an 11% ABV brew this one is very drinkable; you would never guess how alcoholic it really is. Add that to really tasty sweet and tart flavor with a somewhat silky mouthfeel and its clear that Mad Elf is one of those beers that can get you into a bit of trouble. Highly recommended, but imbibe carefully."
"I popped my one to enjoy after meeting with a damn wedding photographer. Red kool-aid color and a hint of a head in my duvel tulip. Smells of a mild fruityness and alcohol. The taste is not what I was expecting, not nearly enough of the cherry flavor and I wonder now about the color. The alcohol is prevelent and there is a background fruityness and some malt flavor with a tannic bitterness. I had a decent mouthfeel and was very clean finish and a good drinker even at 11%, but not really my bag."
"Pours an amber color with tinges of ruby red. No head to speak of. Honey and cloves in the aroma, with a trace of sour cherries. The honey really stands out in the flavor with a subtle cherry in the background. Also a little spice and cloves. Full bodied and well carbonated."
"Flavor holds on to the sweet bite of cherries throughout, but also adds some spicy elements. An excellent balance of sweetness and spices. A bit of breadyness in the finish. Had I not known I would have never guessed this as an 11% ABV."
"Pours a clear, medium reddish-copper with a very small, frothy, slightly off-white head that quickly diminishes to a thin film. Actually didnt even know what style this beer was until I smelled it. Obvious Belgian with moderate wheat, sweet malts, cherry and some other fruit esters accompanying the light alcohol presence. Toward the end of the bottle when it really warmed up, I was picking up some light clove and a light woodsy smell. Flavor-wise, it starts out with rather typical Belgian flavors, mostly because I had served it too cold. it then opens to reveal a wonderful malt backbone and a complex array of flavors, but its the duo of cherries and sweet malts that steal the show. I admit at first it threw me a bit, but the second try was much better. And it kept getting better all the way to the bottom of the glass. It has a medium body, lightly oily texture and soft carbonation. This is a real holiday treat that is well done. Hard to believe this beer is 11%! Use with caution."
"Drinkability: A good brew and a nice surprise from one of my favorite breweries."
"Slàinte!"
"The only downside of this beer is in the drinkability department. This is a very intense experience, almost too intense. This is strong enough that you could use it as syrup, just briefly bring this to a boil and you could pour it over pancakes. It is the syrup intensity of this that cuts its drinkability score significantly. This would make an amazing glaze for a ham or just pour over ice cream like hot caramel. An amazing beer that is probably too intense for 99% of most people."
"THE BLOODHOUND FACTOR: The hounds sniffed this, and maybe it was the alcohol, but they ran. No way they were gonna try this one."
"Another sample courtesy of dirtylou's cellarfridge."
"drinkability: for the style, a little above average"
"Kudos to fuzzyfrog & SwillinBrew for each flinging me a bottle of this."
"12 oz. bottle with no freshness date, but sure it's this year's version - served in a big wine glass. It pours with almost no head and remains that way. It is a clear, brilliant red/orange that is fit for a gemstone, but looks lifeless with no head or beads of carbonation and, hence, no lacing. It smells Belgian, with fruits (maraschino cherries?), malts, pepper/spiciness, and alcohol near the end. The taste has this plus medicinal phenols, banana, hints of clove, and perhaps some bubblegum. The body is medium and the drinkability is about what I would have expected. Not the best from Tröegs, but we'll see what the cellar will do to it."
"Purchased at the Gingerbread Man in Carlisle, PA. Had to see what the hype was about, and I was not impressed. The beer had a dark red hue, with a very thin head that did not retain much aroma. Something mildly fruity was there, like watermelon. The first sip was metallic and stingy. Hot alcohol abounded. Midway through, the fruit came through more predominantly--strawberry mostly, and other juicy red fruits. It reminded me a bit of Juicy Fruit gum. I could not detect the spicy yeastiness normally associated with Belgian-style beers. The pint I had felt a little thin. It was not what I was expecting or hoping for in an American-made Christmas release of a belgian strong dark."
"Thanks to OCBrewFish for this one!"
"Price - had to pay $50 for a case of beer. Not worth spending for th entire case. Should get it at brewery with a six pack rather than getting a case."
"Drinkability - No matter how hard I look for it I cannot find the alcohol presence, match that with the super clean finish and you get a pretty drinkable beer. Still don't think I could drink 3 litres though."
"Pours a bright brick red with a small off-white head that neverthless has good retetention and leaves some moderate lacing. Nose is nice natural cherries, not syrupy, a honey sweetness, and a slight clovelike spiciness. Taste is a nice smooth cherry with some other pear/apple fruitiness, a nice bready malt, and a decent spicey and hoppy finish. Mouthfeel is medium/full with a nice smoothness. Overall this is a really nice beer, hides the alcohol well, nice to sip on a cold day."
"Cheers!"
"This is a good beer to drink when it is cold. The prominent alcohol leaves you feeling warm inside, and the appearance and cherry taste make it a good beer to drink during the holidays."
"This is a nice holiday brew, but one at a time is plenty. I enjoyed it and look forward to next years offering. Probably a little on the pricey side but worth it once a year. I wasn't sure what i would think about this one, i normally don't like beers with fruit added, but this was just subtle enough to be enjoyable."
"I was led to believe that the $13.99 price for the 6-pack and the supposed ruby red color would make this a standout, but the Mad Elf seems to be better suited as just the only American version of a Belgian Strong Ale that I've ever seen or drank. With my experiences with Troegs in the past, the bar for this was set quite high, and even though I was a bit disappointed, I enjoyed this beer and look forward to their other offerings that I haven't tried yet. Worth a shot but not worth the price in my opinion..."
"M&Dr - A dry and light medium bodied brew that is very drinkable. You cant even taste the alcohol on this spicey treat."
"EDIT: after i saw the bottle again, and the ""holiday ale"" label, i decided that to judge this beer as a ""belgian strong ale"" is missing the point. there was a nice spicing that was quite holiday-ish and it was actually incredibly drinkable"
"Poured into my tulip glass a dark amber hue with ruby highlights, topped by an inch of bright white head that decides only to make a brief appearance. Inviting aroma of Belgian yeast, biscuit, cherry, a touch of piney hops, and a good deal of alcohol. Palate is wonderfully complex - sweet malt with honey, some dark cherries, light spicy hops, Belgian yeast, and a bit of astringency. The alcohol makes itself known, providing a nice warming finish. The body is fully and slightly creamy, about perfect for the style. This is only the second beer I've been able to acquire from Troegs, and I have to say they do pretty well with their Belgian styles. Wish I'd gotten more than one bottle."
"D - There is not a single negative aspect to this beer, but there is nothing great either. I am surprised. It is good, in the sense that it does not offend and is easy to drink. I would sooner have many other holiday brews. Maybe it was the hype, but this Troegs beer is a bit of a disappointment."
"Pours a somewhat indistinct hazy amber with a thin off-white head that dissapates quickly. The aroma is intriguing, with notes of cherry, honey, belgian yeast, some chocolate, toasted bread, alcohol and some mineraly hops. The flavor is surprisingly subtle for a beer of this magnitude, with notes of cherry, dark fruits, honey, toasted bread, fruity esters, chocolate and some earthy, mineraly hops. The mouthfeel is medium with light carbonation, and drinkability is quite impressive considering the massive abv. An interesting beer from Troegs, kind of an american/belgian hybrid...tasty and complex and the alcohol is incredibly well hidden."
"Just don't drive anywhere, in anything after two of these."
"christmasy red, clear with no head. some bubbles. big nose of belgian malt with silky accents from the honey. reminiscent of other american belgian-style ales in its overabundance of malt without accompanying fruity-sweetness. flavor is complex and very smooth for 11%. starts off with mild cherry hints, more of the maraschino variety than sour red. follows up immediately with some band-aid (ok, alot of band-aid) and spicy heat. the abv was bound to resurface somewhere, and here it is. peppery, finishes with a big cherry juice blast. speaking of maraschino, its reminiscent of the water they pack those cherries in- like a beery shirley temple (or is it rob roy, i never remember). last bottle i had felt more cough syrup cherry than juicy cherry, and this is a vast improvement. nice holiday sipper although you can gulp it. malts are a little 'dirty' (corny?) and for a fruit/spiced brew it comes off awfully plain. still, freshness makes this elf a very good one."
"Poured from the bottle a rusty reddish-brown with very little head that quickly dissolved to light lacing on the top & edges. Light carbonation, just a few bubbles rising in the glass. There's a dry maltiness/fruitiness in the aroma. Taste is initially of dry, chocolate covered cherries with malt & a touch of honey on the finish. Mouthfeel is lively & bubbly. I get pretty much NO hint of this clocking in at 11% abv, no alcohol burning or bitterness. This could sneak up & bite you if you're not careful. Overall, a nice winter warmer, well worth the wait, and a nice addition to the holiday tradition. BTW, for those of you complaining about the price, $38.99 @ Total Wine & More in Claymont, DE. Get there anyway you can while they last!!!"
"Can't wait to get my hands on a 3litre of this for the holidays."
"Beer pours an amber reddish color and with a vigorous poor only had about a 3/4 inch head. The head dissipated quickly and before I had a chance to take the first sip was completely gone. Beer smells sweet with a lot of cherry flavor coming through. The beer tastes similar to the aroma with a lot of cherry flavor, sweetness from the honey, and almost no hop aroma or taste to speak of (surprising for a Troegs Brew). There wasn't a lot of carbonation and to my surprise almost no alcohol warming for an 11 percent ABV brew. This beer was very drinkable and I haven't been able to have just one yet. I wish Troegs would add a small amount of hops to balance the sweetness of this beer which is something I would never thought I'd say about a Troegs beer. In all however this is a very tasty beer and is perfect for the Holidays (especially Thanksgiving dinner)."
"Pours a hazy red amber color, minimal head but big crackling bubbles. It says on the front that it is brewed with honey and cherries; both flavors come in immediately along with Belgian sugar and meaty hop shots. Alcohol is felt but not tasted, though as it is known if you have too many of these you will keel over. Suprisingly subdued finish adds to drinkability, I hate cherries and honey, yet actually enjoy this beer, the Brothers have done it again."
"Increasingly eagerly awaited each holiday season, it certainly should be this year. All the elements envelop the senses and seem to exist just for your enjoyment. It's a winter warmer that wraps you in sweet holiday cheer. The ABV is felt rather than tasted, but it is very real, and not to be forgotten. Still, I can't imagine a time when the first wouldn't lead to a second. Hell, you can keep your egg nog; mad elves make good beer."
"For those of you interested but unable to find Mad Elf, you can also try Ommegang's Three Philosophers, which is in the same lines (thanks to the guys in Red Bank's Spirits for pointing that out in the past)."
"A sipper for me...no doubt, one to enjoy as the temps dip below freezing tonight. I will look to pick up a fresh bottle to compare, but can't imagine it will change that much in the time that has passed. Another nice offering from Troeg's even if it is not one of my favorites...recommend giving it a try, just maybe not snagging a case without tasting it first."
"I feel like I've been duped. This is a wine, not a beer! No offense to GCBrewingCo, if he happens to be reading this (I've already thoroughly enjoyed everything else from that trade), but I am not impressed at all by this beer. In fact, this is the type of thing that put me off from holiday beers last year, but I am going to stay the course for this year."
"I tried this too cold and I wasn't that impressed, so tonight I am trying it at room temp and it is much better. The big difference is the smell; I get a big whiff of apples, dates, figs, and a bready backbone. It has a clear amber color with a small tan head. The flavor starts with cherries, then a bit of the apples, and then the bready malt. The mouthfeel is medium, not creamy like I was expecting. The alcohol warming sets in after the second sip. It finishes somewhat dry from the high carbonation. This beer is way too drinkable considering the 11% abv. I recently had a Chimay Blue and the Elf is like that turned down a notch or two in body and taste, which isn't a bad thing."
"The taste was exceptionally smooth and not overly pince coney or spicey, probably a bit more tame than I would have hoped for. All in all, a very nice beer but one that you can drink far too much of far too quickly, so be careful."
"I would happily have 2 more of Troegs Mad Elf (and I'm sure they'd make me even happier). I plan to pick up some more very soon."
"overall not bad but definitely nothing to write home about"
"Mouthfeel is a little thin in my opinion, could be a bit thicker. Drinkability is okay for the high abv. The flavor or aroma doesn't really offer anything which I find particularly intriguing which would make me really desire this in the future. Maybe the flavors don't hold up for very long, I'm not sure. I have one more bottle to sample though."
"This beer is hard to believe. It's so full of cherry and spice character, the alcohol is very well hidden, and the malt supports it very well. Get a case of this right now!"
"The deep amber, ruby-highlighted Elf raised only a short, quickly dissipating head of tiny tan bubbles that left no lacing. The smell is of dry cherries, sweet honey, hints of clove, and touches of alcohol. It has a medium mouthfeel with a fairly light body and light carbonation. It has a sweet, dry cherry finish. There are hints of cinnamon as well, coupled with the malts. The alcohol is stealthily cloaked behind the cherries. Extremely well balanced, this is a wonderful beer. It would be easy to enjoy several in a row before noticing how potent they are."
"Last year I discovered Mad Elf and I couldn't get enough of it. This year it is wonderful yet again and has inspired me to write my first review here on BA. Hopefully many more to come!"
"Overall, very drinkable at 11%!!! It's a wonder that people can drink a 6-pack of it, get sick, and pass out by the halftime of the Super Bowl (inside joke)!"
"I highly recommend this beer. I feel that it is very approachable and quite tasty. If you happen not to like it, um, good, more for me!"
"A bit thin in mouthfeel, but this is easily overlooked. Due to the decently masked ABV, accessable flavor profile, and of course, the picture of the mad elf himself, this is a nice beer to be enjoyed with friends around the holidays--or as an introductory beer for someone who may not ordinarily give beer a fair shake. Happy glugging!"
"overall: hmmm...this is just an average belgian strong dark. mildly flavorful with cherry and alcohol flavors taking center stage. dangerously drinkable, but the mouthfeel is lacking. if you want an easy to drink, intoxicating, belgian with just a hint of belgian spices and phenols and splashes of cherry, then oddly, this is your brew. otherwise, just average."
"Drinkability: The alcohol is hidden well. Kind of sneaks up on you in the finish. The yeasty funk is something that keeps me from over doing it with these styles but it's blended well with the fruit presence. Really enjoyable. I don't know if it seems like a ""holiday"" beer to me but it's worth trying."
"I want to like this beer due to its high ABV and local relevance (went to school near where it's made) but I just can't get the stuff down from the bottle. On tap though, ooo yeah that's the stuff."
"This beer poured a beautiful dark ruby red color with a nice, creamy head. The taste was a smorgasbord of cherries, vanilla and honey --- an extremely sweet beer, but unfortunately it reminded me too much of cough syrup. I would like to try this on tap to see if there is much of a difference. Great appearance, but the taste was too overwhelming."
"Drinkability - This is a sipper by all means. It reminds me of cherry lip balm in a weird way. A little hard to swallow, even after aging for over 1.5 years. Delicious but still a one and done for me."
"Sorry, but couldn't help but think this was light cherry cough syrup. It even had the same sticky mouthfeel going down. Slight tanin like hop finish. Not fond of this one on tap after it had been sitting a few months. Plus, I'm not overly sure if this is a Belgian strong..."
"This is a very drinkable warm weather brew, but not one that I could drink constantly. The sweetness makes it a great dessert beer. It is very different from the regular winter brews that I am used to, but it's definitely one that I'll come back to."
"The beer pours a hazy amber color with a 1/4"" offwhite head that fades to lacing. The aroma is great. It has a nice malty scent that boasts of pale and crystal malts along with a slight honey sweetness and a mild cherry aroma. The taste is good. It has a smooth malty flavor that goes down easy and finishes warm and full of cherries. It has a residual honey sweetness. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a damn good beer. I've heard about it for a while, but never could get it. I love the use of cherries. This is a good drinker."
"Overall, wow, I was really hoping that this would be better. Nevertheless, I'm not very fond of it and I probably won't have much more of it."
"Drinkability - a good beer that improves as it warms but could use more holiday spice flavor sooner. Still, if I had access to this it could be an annual tradition."
"from the bottle. poured a nice amber, with no head. aroma, at 1st I got a sourness when it was 1st poured thanafter it sat for a couple of minutes the sourness went away, got honey, malts, cherries, chocolate, yeast, alcohol. flavor, tart cherries, fruits, orange, choclate, and a nice touch of alcohol not tobad of a beer."
"From the cellar meat package by pentathlete, the Mad Elf came out deep amber red with a smallish head. The beer looked slippery, and the dissipating head left little lacing. The aroma was filled with holiday spices like nutmeg, ginger, and I could also smell orange peel. The taste was sweet and spicy with a cheerfully light body that was backed by rum like alcohol warmth. Although clearly a strong concoction, the 11% alcohol was well poised. The mouthfeel was airy and inviting. The aftertaste was a citric and sweet tang and a faint note of hop bitterness. Warmth of alcohol lingered long after the beer was gone."
"Flavors are of light malt up front and quickly switch to a bit of cherry with just a hint of honey. The smell is decent enough but the taste is quite good, especially as it warms. It's alarmingly easy to drink for the alcohol content."
"Christmas in April, whay not? 2004 edition. Poured a delightful clear cherry color with slight head that left minimal ring. Smell is of cinnamon and spice and all things nice.Alcohol well hidden. Taste is superb with a hint of dryness in the back of the throat. Left a nice fruity taste in the mouth. at 11% very drinkable. Next taste will be Christmas in July."
"Cloudy copperiness. Somewhat tan head. I get candied yeastiness, but sadly some soapiness in the aroma. Taste is a bit muddied, malty, yeasty, spicey, and some soapiness in there as well. Ends a bit citrusy. Mouthfeel is medium, carbonation is somewhat low."
"This pretty good. It loses it's punch in time. But I like the initial presentation a lot. I like the spicey sour aspects of the flavor."
"Ruby red tulip pour with a big frothy white head that disappears rather quickly. Smell is easy to pick up even in a smoke-filled bar. Cherries, malt, and enough alcohol that you know what you're getting into. Flavor is also heavy on the cherry notes, but I also caught some cinnamon and clove as well The alcohol is present in the flavor and gives it a bit of a peppery bite, but it's not as strong as you'd expect from an 11% ABV. A nice one to sip and savor, and I really enjoyed this one more as it warmed a little."
"Poured into a big ol wine glass, this unique ale appears brilliantly red with a small frothy white head. The aroma is spicy with phenols. First flavors to come across are the fruity cherries with the floral sweetness of honey. The sweetness is balanced by a nice of spicy esters and refreshing bitterness with a slightly hot alcohol finish. The mouthfeel of this beer is relatively light for the ABV due to the use of honey to thin it out, which makes this brew very drinkable."
"Last swigs: This is the Nobel Peace prize for Winter Warmer brew. Especially, locally. Go Chris & John Trogner. Glas that I bought a case with Stingo."
"Some initial frothiness with a piling of big bubbles in the middle which all just settles to a wash. Light orange hue with just a touch of red and haze, likely from sediment, and very little slow action. Cherry sweetness on nose, raspberry pulp and a bit of light heat. Candy cane sweetness with cherry pie thrown in, but quite light; malt presence is refined with a woody oak character that lightly touches. Very pleasant offering that I wish I had access to on a regular, or at least seasonal, basis."
"pinkish coppery color with very thin head that a lighter version of the same color. sweet ripe cherry aroma, with honey, a subtle spiciness, and light caramel maltiness. a good amount of alcohol is also present along with some subtle typical belgian aromas of banana, clove. cinnamon as it warmsthe taste is very much like it smells, with the cherries and malts more pronounced. there is a nice warming alcohol quality at the finish. reasonably full bodied with delicate carbonation. very drinkable, but definitely one to let warm up to near room temperature. i'm glad i had a chance to pick this up, i wish it was available a little closer to home."
"-Oelergud"
"Lovely clear ruby in color with a respectable layer of tan-colored head that died off to a lasting ""edge of the glass"" ring. Surprising quantities of lace on the glass. Nose initially was mostly cherries, but as it warmed, other smells were noted: honey, sweetness from the malt, some medicinal alcohol, and spices. Flavor was delicious...and this coming from an avid hater of cherries. Melded nicely into the overall fabric of the beer, the cherry notes were not overbearing or anything. The spices and honey become more apparent as it warmed. The alcohol content makes itself known towards the end and the finish is quite clean. Mouthfeel, overall, is good and given the masked ABV, insanely drinkable. Thank goodness I can seek out the Elf here in Richmond every winter!"
"Pours a brilliant near ruby red, with a thick head of bright white foam. The foam reduces quickly, enabling the cherry and honey flavors of the nose to stand out as well as the noticeable but not unagreeable scent of alcohol. These notes are borne out in the taste as well. Eminently drinkable, though with a slightly thinner mouthfeel than I would have expected from this style. This is a quibble however as the Mad Elf is one fine winter brew."
"There are many good things about living in the city of Brotherly Love. Finding Mad Elf on tap unexpectedly would be one of them. This may be my favorite holiday beer. I love the color, ruby red. Elegant, sophisticated, like the taste. Beer tastes more like a cordial, essence of berry, a warm brandy like effect. Excellent balance and mouthfeel make this beer dangerously drinkable, even for some of my non-beer friends. The big suprise being that is has a decidedly strong kick to it(11% can defintiely sneak up on you..)A wonderful, happy glass of holiday cheer, a way to keep the holday spirit alive through cold winter nights. If you can find it on tap, it is worth it! Drink it with someone you love."
"Fun one in the case splitting extravaganza with Stingo, BrewAngel, and The BlitheringIdiot."
"Nice creamy, full mouthfeel with good carbonation. No complaints from me. Drinkability is good, as this is a tasty brew I could have a few of. Many thanks to blitheringidiot and merlin48 for hooking me up with some bottles of this!"
"Now this had the character that Old Fezziwig was missing. Beautiful red color that catches the light nicely with a smallish white head. A good bit of bubblegum in the aroma, a touch of clove (yeast or spice?), coriander, peppery alcohol and a touch of malt. The flavor carries on with a little less complexity than the aroma, but with just a touch of cherries. 11%? I couldnt tell. Fun beer."
"I had this beer on what turned out to be the coldest day in a long time, with wind chills dipping below 0. The bar was very small, and my seat was near the entrance. Every time the door swung open, the whole bar iced over. Drinking Mad Elf made me welcome the cold breeze that night, warming me like a brandy by a fire. It's the best holiday beer I had this season, and I tried many. The Elf is spicy with just the right amount of sweetness. The beer's taste doesn't mask its might -- a winter-worthy 11-percent -- but the ale is nonetheless pretty drinkable. The Elf has melted this Gnome's heart."
"Drinkability- I'm already feeling it after half this beer. I have another one left that I am going to age and maybe try next winter and see if it thickens up a bit. Thanks very much to by BA bud Santoslhalper who has sent me several brews I have yet to try. This one scores pretty well though. Quite tasty, even if I did have it with Boston Market take out. Probably would have been paired better with something else."
"We shared a 12 oz bottle between a few people at a Xmas party. Hazy, amber/orange colored with a dense white head. Spicy-sweet malt aromas complimented by a fruity, definately-Belgian yeasty, biscuity note. Taste is surprisingly less sweet than anticipated. Triple-like in character with a pleasantly subdued cherry/berry flavor balanced out by a spicy malt and hop profile. Big mouthfeel and moderate carbonation. Extremely enjoyable. I was expecting an overly sweet, cherry flavor, but this is very nice. PS-I have a feeling that this bottle is a year or two old, althought the host of the party doesn't remember."
"Thanks, Shaggy9356, for the chance to re-visit"

"A nice night cap."
"Maybe this thing needs to be cellared for awhile but I am not a fan. It reminds me of Robotussin. In the words of Chris Rock ""Out of Tussin? Put water in the bottle and shake it up, More tussin!"" It definitely has a lot of stuff going on, I'll give it that. Tons of alcohol in this one with a big malty sweetness. The cherry aftertaste though is horrid. Truely horrid. A very unbalanced beer, the alcohol is very evident and makes it an unpleasent, if warming, drinking experience. Lots of people seem to like this so maybe my tastebuds are tweaked the wrong way but this stuff tastes like cough medicine to me."
"Thanks to meathookjones for the bottle of this. I've been waiting to try it. Pours an amber/red color with a very small head. The aroma is excellent. Aromas of cherries, honey, spices. Very nice. The flavor is odd in a very good way. The honey and cherries meld together for a great flavor. There is a spice there to ... possibly from a belgian yeast. Very drinkable. This is one that could easily sneak up on you. Dangerous."
"This one pours a nice deep amber color with just a coating of head over top of the beer. The nose is very belgian in character, some spiceyness from the yeast and lots of sweetness, hints of cherries. Smells good. It tastes of goodness. The first thing I get is a nice peppery spice, followed by sweet malt and finished with a nice honey sweetness that goes over the front of my tongue. Wow. Not a hint of the alcohol in there. The feel is nice and thick, leaving a coating of beer in my mouth after swallowing. Drinkability is nice on this one as well. For a big ass beer, its easy drinking and smooth. I like it. Thanks to clvand0 for sharing this with me."
"Id been wanting to try this beer for some time. Id read about it, and even heard about it on a tour of the brewery. This was my first chance. It pours a red, slightly hazy color with a thin head. The head is slight, and disappears quickly. The aroma is intense, and predominately of sour cherries. Underneath, there is a malt-like sweetness and alcohol. The taste is fruity, malty, and fairly complex. Medium to heavy body, with low carbonation. An alcohol warming sets in as you drink this onebut the effect on taste well hidden for an 11% ABV. This is excellent!"
"Drinkability - Clearly, this beer will kick your ass if you're not careful. Since it's NOT a stout and be consumed pretty easily (especially since the alcohol is balanced so well with the taste), watch out. And even if you could make a session out of this, why would you really want to? Have one at a time so it can be fully enjoyed."
"D&N: Nicely complex, pretty punchy, this one has me feeling just fine about life, if ya know what I mean. A very nice holiday offering from two killer brewmeisters. Check it out."
"Sweet cherry and yeasty banana play well against eachother in the nose. The color is a reddish amber topped off with a ring of white around the edge of the glass. Tight, almost abrasive carbonation gives the tongue a heads up while a rush of tastes enliven the palette. Noble hop aromas, carmelized cherries, subtle malt sweetness, along with a complex, spicy dimension typical of Belgian strong ales combine to express qualities of licorice and bubblegum. The high alcohol content is gracefully hidden in the taste, revealing itself with a warming sensation in the chest. This is a big beer that most certainly must be consumed in moderation. I am more than impressed with the Elf, however Mad he may be. This years version easily lives up to all the hype."
"This is a perfect winter seasonal that I could enjoy any time of the year. Drinkability is dangerous, given the hidden alcohol claimed by the label. Exceptional brew from an excellent brewery. A huge thank you to mtnlover for bringing this nectar my way."
"Overall an interesting holiday beer. I think I'll age my others for at least another month, then try another. This one hasn't been in the bottle but two weeks."
"Big thanks to Pisskynights for this brew, thanks a bunch!"
"Beer pours a clear ruby amber color I don't know why but I like beers that look red for some unknown reason, caps with a tan head ever so briefly no lace but at 11% no suprise. Aroma is sweet fruity cherry but also apples on top of honey and malt with light hints of chocolate malt but very light. Smells very good some alcohol is also present but it compliments the fruity aroma and is not a distraction. Taste is sweet fruity cherries dipped in honey that linger until light choclate picks up and adds some to the sweetness followed by lingering alcohol enhanced very light bitterness thats slightly sour like green apples maybe more so then any hops. A light spice tingle is also felt thru out the experience but very light and for me undefinable. Alcohol is evident thru out but always in the background and complimenting the experience it warms the body and the soul hard to believe it is 11% taste more like 8%. Mouthfeel is suprisingly medium was expecting something little heavier but that makes it that much more dangerous. Drinkability is great this is one hell of a seasonal beer very well done."
"I originally had this when I was first getting into craft brew and thought it was quite interesting but not my cup of tea at the time. Seeing as it came out the same did I was picking up some other beers I decided to give it a try again. This pours out a cherry juice red with a decent beige head that eventually falls to a coating of bubbles. Decent lacing was left around the glass as this was consumed. Aroma was a bit sweet with a bit of cherries and a bit of spiciness. Alcohol was evident but it mixed well and added positively to the smell. The taste starts off with a sweet maltiness that had notes of cherries and other fruits with a touch of honey. There was a good amount of spice as well. Aftertaste was a lingering sweetness. Mouthfeel was about medium with a slick and warming feel to it. Pretty damn good drinkability here with the large alcohol being hidden really well. It did warm me up quite a bit as I drank it. Overall this is a very interesting and tasty beer that I would recommend if you havent had it already. Oh and Venoms suggestion to have it warm was spot on."
"Pours a deep, glowing dark red with a thin head. A tiny bit of carbonation bubbles up. Chocolates and cherries burst through the smell of this beer. A nice warming scent of alchohol as well. This is a suprisingly malty tasting brew. Very sweet and fruity with a small but pleseant amount of hops coming through in the back. A beautiful holiday beer. This is going to be one of my ""12 beers of christmas"" this year. The best offering from Troeg's I've had. This is one of those beers that you won't forget for a long time. Highly, highly recommended."
"Cudos, this is a great beer. Grab one before there all gone."
"Drinkability: I liked it well enough, but I don't think I could ever force myself to drink this quickly. One is probably more than enough as an after dinner drink, or apertif. Whew! Potent stuff."
"The Elf only appears once a year, though this year the supply seems better (Bastage employees at the local beer store didn't buy it all this go-round!). Well worth a six pack."
"Mouthfeel was thick and syrupy at the start and finish. The malt seemed to stick to the tongue, and an alcohol kick came just after swallowing. This is a super brew, but for sippin' and relaxing on a cold evening only."
"Overall a damn good brew. Perhaps not a classic but certainly one to seek out."
"Stored in the closet for about 8 months. Doughy fruity (cherry) aroma with a hint of alcohol. Opaque, ruby chestnut colored beer. Small, froathy dark cream colored head fades to a broken film. Small, scattered patches of lace cling to the glass. Mellow, creamy vanilla up front with a pinch of cherry, a bit of alcohol takes it into the finish. Nice solid beer, but not very sticky, easy to drink. Damn tasty, I wish I had a case."
"Light reddish brown, I expected it to be pinkish red! No head. Cinnamon, nutmeg, apples, rhubarb, grapes and pomegranate sweet fruity vinous aroma. Earthy and caramel undertones. Mild vodka is noticeable in mouth. Caramelic sweettarts, apples, vinous grapes, cinnamon and tart fruits on the tongue. Rather thin bodied unfortunately, low carbonation. A beer that is hard to interpret well, this could be a spicy cooler for all I know, but its not without pleasure to sip. Fun to brew I guess, but a bit expensive for what it is. I wouldnt try more than once anyway. Thanks you Mr Weizen."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed 3/4"" of beige head, which laced nicely, over the reddish copper brew. Aroma is of cherries and malts. Taste is not the tartness one might expect from the cherry aroma, but malts upfront, combined with a deep sweet cherry flavor, which is not overdone, as could easily be a problem, but just right. Alcohol kind of creeps in at the end, in a nice kind of way. Mouthfeel excellent, just like a Belgian dark that you would expect, and the drinkability is excellent, in that even if you aren't interested in another straightaway, the character of the brew will make you return at another time. Excellent holiday brew."
"Anyway, this was a good one."
"Mouthfeel is a bit thin, somewhat watery, leading to flavors of cherry and honey, and some light brown sugar, and some clove in the finish. Also a bit of a metallic notes underneath, perhaps from the alcohol, but no other indications of the ABV strength. Average drinkability due to the rich and yeasty flavors and the alcohol strength."
"Thanks to Sulldaddy for the bottle!!"
"Oddly enough, the Mad Elf had the unfortunate combination of being a little too thin for my taste, along with having too much of an alcohol flavor, with the 11% being very poorly hidden. Though still quite tasty and interesting, I have a feeling this needed to sit for another year to settle down a bit."
"Very drinkable bier so be careful because this mad elf will smack you around if you drink to many of his buddies."
"This is outstanding....this is what all breweries should put out for their winter beers....On my dream tap list this would occupy one of the season lines during the winter months....a must try...lived up to its considerable hype .."
"Smell with full of sweet juicy cherries, and lots of high alcohol presence. Taste was tart to start, striking flavors full of cherries, but also had dull underlying breadiness. Malty, as the beer warmed the flavors improved. The cherry tartness softened, while the dull bread was balanced out. All the time a slightly medicinal alcohol heat and flavor. Delicate carbonation, light to moderate bodied, but never watery. Held together remarkably. Got a little sticky sweet to finish. I thought this would be classified as a Fruit/Vegetable beer, but definitly can see it's Belgian dark strong ale classification as well. Doesn't have the earthyness of a belgian, but the heat, and complexity are there. Sampled after nearly 4 months in the fridge, might even be better had I left them sit longer."
"I don’t know how I haven’t reviewed this yet. According to my records, I bought 4 of these. I drank one almost right away, and pulled this one yesterday. That means that there should be 2 more in my cellar. I think I must have drunk the first one too cold as I don’t remember its making this kind of impression. Heeding VENOM’s warning, I served this one warm (but not quite room temperature as I expected it to warm further). Great advice, but next time I will probably start drinking this a touch colder, as it warms quickly and the sweetness begins to dominate. This is an impressive achievement, combining complexity, depth of flavor, warming alcohol, and an impressive texture in one great beer. A bargain considering the product. I’m only sorry I didn’t get more. Next year, I’ll be buying much more if I can get it."
"Pours a nice red color. Fruity nose. Cherries. Pours with a thick red head. interesting. I have 5 bottles aging. I can't wait to see what they will taste like in a year. This beer was so fresh. Really enjoyable. Interesting flavors. Lots of fruit. I enjoyed this beer. Had this at Andy's too."
" Kudos to the one and only Feloniousmonk for introducing me to my new mad friend."
"Thanks to feloniousmonk for saving me a bottle!"
"Drinkability: I wanted much more from this brew, I can't help but thinking that this would benefit from a wee bit o time in the bottle."
"Notes: Perhaps one of the most interesting beers I have run into for a long time. Highly complex yet this bottle seems a touch green  you have to wonder what a year or two in the cellar would yield."
"served cellar/room temperature per suggestions on this site, and boy did it make a difference. pours an amber/ruby colour with a thin, slightly tan head that has a moderate stickiness to it. the smell is loaded with cherry, but because of this it had a bit too much of a cherry medicine smell at times. i thought the cherry was going to have to be toned down a bit, especially before sipping this one, but at a warmer temperature, their taste within the beer is just right. much more subdued than in the the smell. ther eis also a mild alcohol flavouring throughout which provides a nice warming effect. as the beer itself warms the taste gets that much better. the finish is slighty dry and this is just tasty all around. a ver yeasy to drink brew for 11% abv. it's a bit too sweet to drink more than one or two per sitting, but i'd definitely sample it again in the future."
"Comments  OldFrothingSlosh sent this one to me out of the blue, and boy was I ever glad that he did. A big THANX for getting this one out to me  BeerAdvocates rule!"
"This was interesting. The beer came out clear with a very red tint. A big head fizzed up right away, and then went quickly down to nothing. The aroma is mainly cherries, but I get some cranberries also. It smells both sweet and sour at the same time. The taste is different: cherry with a hint of sourness. Very little carbonation. The alcohol is evident, but blends in nicely. Unique and very good."
"The alcohol here is mild but clearly present. Gives it a distinctly classy feeling and that Belgian-esque complexity. Fruit flavors linger for a few moments after its gone. Sampled this evening thanks to Putnam's generosity."
"Poured into a Duvel tulip from a 12 oz bottle, with a low off-white head forming and quickly residing. Color was a gorgeous ruby-amber, radiant and crystal clear. The most noticeable aroma was candied cherry, with qualities of dry cherry Jell-O mix...very nice and wonderfully lush despite the reference to Jell-O. Joining the cherry was a subtle and sweetish malt aroma, and just the slightest hint of alcohol, as it warmed. Tasting the beer revealed a satisfying cherry-malt sweetness, retaining the complexities of fresh cherries. Brandy-like cherry flavors washed over my palate, hitting all of my taste senses with a pleasant warmness. An appropriate level of bitterness rounds out the finish, with some cherry and subtler honey aromatics lingering. Sweetness does not remain in the finish, to its credit. Mouthfeel was full and smooth, although the carbonation level was a tad low. This could have been caused by mishandling/freezing temps on its journey to my fridge. Alcohol was very well hidden in the nose and taste, and was only noticeable by its warming qualities. I found this to be a delightful and rich winter warmer, to be enjoyed by the fire. It opened up and improved dramatically as it warmed. Big thanks to PintOfAle and Beergeek279...whom together made it possible for me to enjoy another after this review."
"Probably my favorite Christmas beer from last year. A rich mix of honey and cherries that's perfect for a cold December night. Simply delicious, and this is certainly a beer I'll be getting plenty of next Christmastime!!"
"A decent holiday beer."
"Interestingly dark orange/ruby pour. I have found it is necessary to get aggressive to produce a head, but doing so nicely mellows the first sip. The label proclaims that Mad Elf is brewed with honey and cherries and there is no doubt upon drinking that they mean it. You can smell both, along with some spice, and they are layered in the taste. I would like this beer to have a bit more body, as that would firm up an otherwise great and unique product. Carbonation is light, alcohol is noticably present but quite drinkable. Strangely enough, this is the beer that rescued my sister from the grasp of a heavily imported green bottled macro, causing her to liberate my stash. Good thing I have a source. I need more."
"I really thought I'd like Mad Elf and was looking forward to the entire sixer. That is, until I drank the first one. If I want a good Christmas brew, I'll reach for a Great Lakes Christmas Ale or a Corsendonk Christmas."
"It was well worth letting this bad boy warm up!"
"Served at 58°F. Pours an amber copper color with a tan head that quickly dissipates. It has an alcoholic fruity nose with a hint of cherry. A soft subtle beer, with a hint of cherry in it. There is quite a bit of sweetness (though not overly so), and it has quite the alcoholic kick in the finish (though not in a bad way, it is in no way a harsh kick). There is a mellow fruitiness that pervades this beer throughout. It is quite light bodied, especially for an 11%'er. The honey probably helps to dry it out. An interesting interpretation of the holiday ale class of brew. Quite tasty, me thinks."
"The only beer my wife really likes and it's nearly impossible to find, even in season. This pours a deep amber with a nice rich head that lasts longer than most. The aroma is a fruitiness that is not really discernable but pleasant. If you didn't know it was cherry, you would just think ""fruity"". Nothing is overpowering in this beer. the cherries, malt and hops blend together for a fruity wine taste that is pleasant, even for a guy who doesn't want fruit in beer. this hits the lips light and finishes full. I was pleasantly surprised and will try to homebrew something close."
"Thanks to PintofAle for the sample."
"12oz. bottle poured into a tulip-style glass. It pours a deep ruby red color with one finger of head. There is minimal lacing left on the glass. The smell is very sweet with overripe cherries, honey, and a hint of alcohol. The taste starts tart with a zing of alcohol up front. The cherries are very present in the middle of the taste, with a slightly hoppy finish. There is a bit of toffee and honey on the finish as well. The mouthfeel is super thick and smooth. The drinkability is fantastic for an 11% brew. A great holiday ale!"
"Time to compare the on-tap to the bottled experience. Pours bright, glowing ruby red. No head, just a ring of lace around the edge of the glass; decent viscous, liqueurish alcohol cling but no bubbles. Aroma is of sweet... very sweet cherries and a mellow yeast-based spiciness. Slightly medicinal and herby, again I believe I detect juniper with an alcohol spiciness at the back of the nose. Flavor is of big sweet cherries (again) and a bit of bready yeast, with the honeyish flavors showing up much better from the bottle than from on tap (for whatever reason). Seems much sweeter than my previous tastings--almost a cola note--verging on cloying IMO. Mouthfeel is still respectably smooth with more alcohol tingle; I would almost say a slightly thick, yogurty (?) finish is left behind. Drinkability is a bit better than fair. Sorry folks, I've been trying; I still find this good but it is just not mindblowing."
"A nice find last night at the Spring House Drafting Room,pours a nice ruby red with a nice creamy,sticky head,aroma is spicey with a light smoky tinge to it.I got the flavors of spiced cherries with tha light smokey flavor with some alcohol note as it warms.Troegs is one of my favorite PA brewers and this offering reinforces that thought."
"Pours an absolutely gorgeous reddish amber color.Very slight head and carbonation.Slight aroma of cherries-some citrus,malt and a backround yeasty-ness.Malty sweetness dominates the flavor with a hint of cherries.The 11% ABV is very well disguised.Wonderful mouthfeel-really smooth and full bodied.What a great beer I must say.I have not been a Troegs fan in the past-just didnt think they were as good and ""special"" as some of the others out there.I'll take that back with this beer however.Some of this will definately be getting ""laid down""-ENJOY!!!"
"Decent warming beer for the occasional slow sipper during the winter time."
"The color a limpid luxurious ruby on the pour with a smallish head that is frothy in texture, light tan in color and as it disperses rather quickly the resultant lace forms a rather thin velum like sheet that just does cover the glass. The aroma of over ripe fruit, such as pineapple greets you first, hints of fusel alcohol along with the malted grains brings up the rear, bubble gum like tones also present with the start ambrosial and rich in malt with the top middling to almost full in feel. Finish is vinous, sternly acidic, the hops delectable in their spicy bite, desert dry and somewhat tart aftertaste that leaves you longing for another sip. Quite a pleasure to drink, big time tummy warmer, a great Winter Warmer, and one I wish was more readily available."
"Domo Arigato, Mr. ManekiNeko for getting this beer to me!"
"The first sip reveals an off sweetness and cherry undertones are evident. The alcohol is only faint on the swallow with some belly warming action occurring. The body is medium thickness with some vinous characteristics, maybe a little viscous. Overall very drinkable. I actually had three of the bottles tonite over a 2 hour span and definitely feel the alcohol a little by the 3rd even if I didnt taste it. this beer is definitely worth the wait. Hopefully you have tried some and if not try to get it and good luck!"
"Hand delivered from the Washington area to Moscow as part of a fiver set of U.S. winter brews. Definitely not my favorite of the five, although I had entertained very high hopes. Poured clear copper under a thin tan head that fades quickly. The nose is mildly sweet, with a touch of cherry. The mouth is fairly flat and heavy with sweetness and fruit. The taste opens with mostly sweet cherries, backed by malt and a touch of honey. I could detect no hops anywhere, but there is some alcohol burn in the finish. The aftertaste is all cherry. It's OK, but I'm not thrilled."
"Clear deep scarlet red hue. A medium sized beige head literally fizzes away in seconds. Not even a thin coating is left. Only a creamy edging that leaves sparse lace. The aroma is really quite remarkable. Beautiful belgian yeastiness, breadiness and mustiness. Sweet brown sugar. And delicate cherry notes. I love it. Oh man, this is one dangerous brew. The taste is fine. The mouthfeel is luscious. And the alcohol is nowhere to be found. This all adds up to an exceptional drinkability. The flavors are subtle, but quite discernable. Chocolate covered cherries. Bready yeastiness. Dark belgian malts. Raisin and rum. A little sweet honey. But I can hardly find a hint of alcohol here. And it's 11%?!? Damn. Maybe just a bit of a lingering bitterness on the aftertaste derived from EtOH. The beer feels like silk in the mouth and the body is medium at best. I understand the ""Mad Elf"" hysteria now. This is damn good."
"Thanks to PisskyNights for the hook-up."
"Cellar temp to start. Deep reddish brown, I missed the color of the head it dissappeared so quick. Had to splash the beer around to get an aroma. Oh, there it is- cherries. Anything else? I don't know, I got sick of having to work for it. Taste was sickly sweet up front, cherry juice with minimal spicy hints. Quite thin for such a high abv beer. Lots of candi sugars? Finish was a bit drier with hot alcohol hits. Overall, just an average attempt IMO, yes, even warm."
"I had this on tap at Fat Heads in the Southside of Pittsburgh. Poured a ruby red, very little head that quickly vanished. The smell was of cherries and a bit of alcohol. The taste was amazing. Cherries, alcohol, and a hint of chocolate. A very exellent beer for the holiday season, I only wish that they would have made more of it... maybe next year. Beware, that 11% abv will come back to haunt you in the morning, but it's well worth it."
". Drinkability is pretty good despite ABV, although I'm ready for a nap after one of these."
"Sampled this years version and not quite as impressed. Lacked the high notes that last years had. Cherry and honey present. Seemed too alcoholic, synthetic and sweet; and the nose was more yeasty and nutty, with perfuminess looming. Not as impressed compared to last years."
"Great beer, I think 2 would be my limit."
"A snap, crackle, pop accompanies the head, with bubbles bursting at the surface. Soon settles down into an off-white table top. Very nice lacing stretching across the glass. Body is a deep, clear red. Cherries shine thru the aroma, as soon as I started to pour. Taste features prominently everything mentioned on the label: cherries, honey, alcohol, and also the malt and hops don't get lost. The malt, honey, and the sense of alcohol create a sort of dopplebock quality, and the cherries are well balanced into the mix, featured but not overwhelming. I feel if you left the cherries out, you would still have a good beer. But I'm not suggesting that. I think the honey is really pulling everything together, balancing flavors, rounding the mouthfeel. I have never been a big fruit beer fan, but I am pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed this. The stock is going fast, but give it a try if you have the opportunity. Tröegs continues to impress."
"Found on draft at Mad Mex the Robinson location, I was just excited to see at tap handle from Troeg's. Appearance: Ruby tinted thin creamy white head little lacing alcohol wards this off. Aroma: Cherries soaked in alcohol with a mild tartness in the air, spices bringing more Christmas cheer, and the malts used a much more complex than bringing out a caramel / mild cocoa scent. Taste: Is comparable to a cherry liquer massive alcohol note sweeps the palate, very warming spicy with tart sweetness and a soft finish this one ties it together. Mouthfeel: Troeg's went MAD this beer has crazy amount of alcohol kicking, full syrupy mouthfeel definitely a one glass at a time type brew. Drinkability: Didn't get tired of the rich tones thought it would be overbearing I was served sixteen ounces of this fine nectar for six bucks not a bad deal."
"PS.. caution after three or four of these you will have full conversations with Jingle... thanks Jcalbi (jim) for the heads up on this brew ...."
"This is a neat one. I am not a big fan of Belgian-style ales. I just don't get into the sweet stuff. But the cherries balance that out for me and this ale is nice because of that. The head is very thin but stays around for the duration of the glass. There is a nice lacing left on the glass. The first taste brings a warming feeling that is quite similar to a glass of wine. The honey adds a nice compliment to the sweet taste. The mouthfeel is quite nice. It seems to have a clean finish to each taste with a hint of spices. The alcohol is strong so you wouldn't want to have many, but there is a nice sense of winter drinkability to the beer. I live 40 minutes from the brewery and can't get my hands on any more. It sold way too fast. Ration it if you have it. Cheers"
" This beer seems to be sucked into my tongue like a sponge. I have to squeeze it to let all the flavors come out, and they do so in great fashion. The start has a beautiful fruit flavor, which then gives you a hint of the alcohol. The warming character is excellent. Spices come in next led by clove. Slight notes of caramel are found occasionally as well. The finish is very balanced, and it leaves you with a spicy aftertaste. This is an excellent brew. The complexity is very nice, and even though it is a pretty heavy beer, it's body is not thick as to hinder drinkability to those who like something lighter. I could drink it all day. I only hope that a good amount of BAs got their hands on this one because it is excellent."
"Drinkability - It is very drinkable on a cold day. Reminds me of Christmas in frnt of a warm fire. Be careful...at 11% alcohol, this one will turn your Happy Holidays into 8 Crazy Nights if you aren't careful!"
"Wow, the appearance alone is worth making the purshase for. Deep ruby color with a fluffy off-white head. Aroma is more sugary than malty, must be from the honey, Taste is much of the same. Surprisingly, the cherry isn't as distinct as you would think. It is presant though and gives this a drinkability that you wouldn't expect from a 11% beer."
"Poured a nearly clear cherry red color with no head at all. Just a thin ring of foam around the edge of the glass. Aroma is fruity and malty with strong notes of sweet cherries. I also detect yeast in the aroma. Has a nice crispness like a Belgian Tripel. Flavor is sugary sweet and syrupy with lots of cherries. Alcohol is well hidden, a pleasurable brew."
"This is the best brew I have had that was made with cherries. It absolute blows away the Unibroe cherry beer, hands down. It smelled like cherries and had a very nice malty aroma with it, as well as the alcohol. The appearance was pretty nice, with the pretty amber color and a creamy head. The head was nice, but lasted a few minutes, then died out to a thin laceing. The taste was similar to the smell, but a little stronger in the cherry area(not too much though, nicely balanced), but the alcohol was barely there for the taste. I was thinking that it was going to be really alcoholy tasteing, but it was hardly noticeable. Man/woman, if it weren;t such a full bodied brew, I would be able to suck this stuff down all night."
"Bottom line: If your lucky enough to get your mitts on a bottle or two of this brew, do it, I think you wont be disappointed!"
"Its a very interesting beer, but in my opinion, should be more balanced out with a better fruit sweetness and not so harsh. This beer is way too young, and could see it aging very well. Too bad there isnt any left of it."
"Drinkability: Not to reference my thread about mixing this and Samichlaus together, but I do wonder if one would be moved from the ""naughty"" to the ""nice"" column if I left a few of these for ol' St. Nick. A great, high-octane fruit beer."
"The Mad Elf pours a nice red color. Not really amber, more of a ruby. The head leaves quickly, probably due to the high alcohol content. The aroma is subtle fruit and spices. The fruit is cherry and it is in the background behind the spices. The label gives no hint at the spice, but I can pickup clove and cinnamon aromas. The flavor is really nice with subtle spice and sweet malt and a semi-dry finish that leaves you with the impression of cherries. The alcohol is only apparent in the warmth you feel after swallowing."
"This pours a very nice looking clear reddish color. It has a nice cherry nose & it's taste is tart yet sweet. It was very enjoyable. The 11% ABV is extremely well hidden, but it sneaks up on you later. I would imagine that this beer is absolutely stunning in a cold climate where it would be a great winter warmer"
"F"
"I tasted it.... I loved it! It wasn't too thick but also not thin... It tasted a lot like it smelled, sweet, honey-ish, fruity, but no banana, and no real taste of the alcohol either, which for me can be dangerous with something as yummy as this, because I'll just want to drink more and forget what I'm drinking, and.... become a Mad Elf myself! However, I didnt, I just drank, and smiled, and went to buy 2 more bottles 2 days later!"
"As I finish the beer, the alcohol content really stands out in the flavor."
"Pours with a just off-white head that quickly settles over clear cherry red liquid. The nose is fruity, mainly cherry with some candi sugar notes. The taste is big on maltiness with some slight background spicy hoppiness and candy-like sweetness. Finishes out sweet and fruity, with really no hint of the 11% alcohol contained within. It will be interesting to see how this cellars in the coming months."
"A pleasant bitter hop flavor started this one off, accompanied by some nearly chocolatey flavors and a nice smoky flavor as well. Finished dry with a mild flavor of tart fruits, cherries I do believe. This is one fine complex Holiday ale."
"This one lets you know up front that it means business, as there's a pleasant, balanced warming surge o' alcohol throughout. Rather dryish, with cherries, some hints of spice, and chocolatey flavors that are more mildly tart than sweet - really interesting flavors going on. As it goes down, some of the tartness dissipates and an oak cask sort of flavor briefly appears. It gets even better as it warms, with the alcohol heading into the background even further. Medium bodied, with a more dry than sweet mouthfeel. A very tasty barleywine."
"This beer poured into the glass a ruby/red/garnet color that sparkled when held to the light. The head was white no lace and did not last, only a film was left. The aroma was fruit and alcohol. Nose of cherries, spices, plums, malt and alcohol were all present at different points on my tongue. The tastes were of spices, fruit (mostly cherries) alcohol and malt. Slightly sweet and tart but not overpowering. I rather enjoyed this beer, it surprised me after my first sip, I was imagining some different flavors then I received. The flavors intensified as this brew warmed."
"Pours an unbelievable reddish, garnet color with a slight head that fades quickly. Very little lace. Aroma of cherries comes through right away, with a slightly tart mouthfeel. Not overwhealming tartness, but a serious alcohol taste, that tries to hide behind the cherries. Much better as it warms, which is easy to do because this is a sippin' beer! Just a guess, but the ABV has to be around 11%. Truely a ""nightcap"" beer!"
"A reddish brown body is capped by a creamy tan head that holds fairly well and leaves some minor lace. The aroma is limited but expresses a soft maltiness, a light touch of alcohol, and a sharp fruitiness similar to cranberry (although cherries are actually used). The body is medium with a gentle, fine bubbled carbonation that leaves it creamy and smooth across the palate. The flavor comes alive with an exceptional balance of light spice, juicy & mildly tart cherry, and a chocolate-tinged malt. The cherry flavor becomes clearer as it crosses the palate, coat-tailed by a firm bitterness and some noticeable alcohol. It finishes dry with only minimal lingering malt notes. Well done and highly drinkable. Somewhat Belgian in character due to the fruit and spice. An exceptionally enjoyable beer that's well worth seeking out."
"Maybe a little young, but this barley wine is good. Dark ruby color looks great when held to light. Smells of sweet cherry and alcohol. The sweet honey/cherry flavor is balanced well with hops. Very clean finish with a lingering alcohol warmth. Wish the beer was bottled so I could age some."
"Pours a dark, almost black color with ruby-red highlights, with a tan colored head, leaves a good lace. On the nose there are whiffs of alcohol, good hop malt balance in the aroma. On the palate there is exotic spices, dark fruits, hints of dried cherries, rich malt flavors, slight sweetness, slight bitterness as well, the alcohol comes through a bit in the finish-11% abvvery good winter brew though"
