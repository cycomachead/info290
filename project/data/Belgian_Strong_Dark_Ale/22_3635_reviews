"O:  ""Sinister"" comes to mind. Bold and full-bodied."

"All the right Belgian notes. Highly viscous, almost oily. Big foamy head, but hardly any carbonation."
"Pours dark, smells like plums and pear. The taste is very crisp and light for a beer this dark."
""
""
""
""
"Remarks:  drier finish than I expected; great beer overall."
""
""
""
""
"Crisp, delicious and current favorite."
""
""
""
""
"Tastes like a combination of port and wine. Reminds me of a quadruple stout I once had."
""
""
""
""
"One of the more wine-like beers I've yet to sample but not devoid of some classic Belgian strong dark or quad features. Rather acerbic despite the obvious sweetness."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured into a standard pint glass. Had an off-white head that dissipated quickly and left very little lacing. I waited for it to warm, because the Belgian yeast was initially very prevalent. As it warmed, plums and brown sugar came to the fore. Nice medium mouthfeel. A tasty brew, but not the best Belgian dark I've had. Still worth drinking, though."
""
"Poured from 750ml bottle into tulip glass. Look: Dark, dark brown almost black, nearly opaque.  Smell: Dates, plums, vanilla... classic quad aroma.....There's some tartness to it, almost like an oud bruin. Taste: caramel, dark fruit, spices... almost chocolatey.  Sweet but not cloying. Surprisingly tart for the style, though not as tart as it smelled. Flavor lingers forever. Superb Belgian style quad. Mouthfeel: immense carbonation but still very big body and syrupy. Super dry without being bitter.Overall: An excellent beer, and at $8.99, its unbeatable. My favorite unibroue is their grande reserve, but this is a close second!"

"750 ml caged and corked bottle, back of bottle says best before 04-15-2015.  Served in a chalice, the beer pours very dark brown with about an inch tan head that stuck around for a little while.  There's also a decent amount of lacing.  I like the aroma, the brew smells like dark fruit, brown sugar, chocolate, caramel, dark bread and a sweet spiciness.  For the most part I think the taste is just like the aroma, but there's also some earthiness and a bit of tart cherries noticeable.  Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's smooth, a bit coating, and has a good amount of soft carbonation.  Overall I liked this, certainly worth picking up if you've never had it before!"

"This is a good beer and an interesting take on a BSDA.  That said, I prefer their other beers to this one.  Pours kinda sickly looking with no head that lasts (it is 10.5%, to be fair), the beer is very wine-like to my senses.  Sweet and boozy, there are some definite alcohol and yeast domination to both the nose and the flavor, with the yeast being less prominent and the alcohol more than in some of their other beers.  The beer has an exquisite palate, with a nice coating warmth complimented by creamy carbonation.  This is definitely a sipper that is best shared with others.  Great big beer for the wine people you might have to entertain...  I liked it, but in the future I would likely just stick to Trois Pistoles; well-worth your time to try if happened upon.  (4.25)"

"Pours a clear very dark brown with cola like khaki head, settles to a thin ring with a few streaks of lace down the glass. Smell: unripe banana, clove and black cherry notes, dark brown sugar. Taste: fig, cola, overripe cherry; notes of: toasted multigrain bread, backgrounded spicy hopping, booze. Carb is pretty serious, pillowy and space-filling. Cola sugary finish, dries out but stays sticky. Enjoyable but not great. Bottling code indicates it's a 10/13 bottling and best before 9/2018."

"O: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, strong and well-disguised kick, good representation of style, it seems to have held up quite well with time as I know this beer was made to do. However, even though it’s a good beer, I didn’t find it to be anything special."

"Poured a very dark ruby, nearly black, with a foamy white head, which lingered on the beer but left no lacing. The aroma is in keeping with Belgian dark ales, with a robust malty sweetness, however my wife only noticed the citrus hops. The taste is a fruity, malty sweetness (think dark fruits), with hints of the citrus hops. Has a very nice texture and is easy drinking, despite it's 10.5% ABV. Expensive, but tasty."

""
""
"This is a very tasty beer and does seem fairly smooth behind the carbonation.  Not sure how a year of aging affected the beer, but I would grab this again."

"In summary, a world-class beer produced by a Canadian firm, and a multiple award winner to boot. My one and only complaint is the lack of availability in Ontario...even though I understand that it is available in the US year round. When it appears again, I'll be stocking up. Assuming that I can resist the temptation to drink it soon, I'll cellar my second bottle for a few years. Who knows...it may get better still! Just before Christmas, Terrible was selling for a rather pricey $10.95 per bottle, costing it a few points on the ""value for money"" factor."
"Yum yum yum. Dark Belgian, tastes a bit like a good thick Dubbel. It grows on you, one of those beers that gets better as you drink it (my kind of beer), and at the end you wish you had another. At the end, when both you and the beer have reached a higher temperature, this beer is at its best."
""
""

"O - A very interesting beer, not quite like anything I've ever had before. Definitely worth trying, but after about half a glass the sweetness is a little overpowering."

"This beer reminded me to that of Trois Pistoles, which is a great beer. I can understand that not everyone has the same taste for beer as the next person, but this beer fit my palate just right. Great beer!!! Truly enjoyed this one and will be stocking up on it for future enjoyment."

"On the whole, I didn't really care for this. Too sweet and unbalanced for me. My taste has recently shifted toward much more hoppy brews, so perhaps that's part of my disappointment with this highly rated ale. As much as I enjoy big Belgian Christmas ales (Corsendonk, St. Bernardus), this strong dark ale from Quebec was more than I bargained for."
""
""
""
"I enjoyed La Terrible out of a snifter with a couple of friends. I loved the heavy raisin smell on the nose, and the beautiful color and mouth-feel this ale provided. I was once a fervent drinker of spiced ales, and they began my beer quest some years ago. La Terrible is an excellent Unibroue offering, and I'll be sure to pick up a few more bottles next time my eye catches the name. I'd love to see how this ale ages!"
"O: most, if not all, of Unibroue's large bottle offerings are pretty killer - this is no exception... have gotten myself in trouble with this one as part of the 'Unibroue Challenge' at Pistola's a few years back"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A great beer, one I'll definitely be buying again. Impeccably balanced and a real pleasure."
""
"Bottle aged 1 year 6 months. Poured into chalice as recommended..has a very dark brown/almost black color, when held to light this beer shows slight tones of dark burgundy. Smell is rich of fruit, yeast, chocolate, and raisin..taste is much more complex than the smell, lots of black cherry up-front, raisin, chocolate, plum, caramel. A rich madeira wine essence and a little woodsy oak on the finish. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, with medium-heavy carbonation, especially for a ""quad"" strong ale. Bubbles are small and stickiness is present on the lacing. Overall a great beer, complex, balanced, and interesting enough. Aging has served this one very well. Serve with aged sharp/stinky cheeses, duck breast, filet mignon, desserts (cheesecake) blackberry chocolate mousse, salted carmel and almond bark."

"Overall great taste, bought a bottle for the holidays and it was somewhat expensive but turned out to be well worth it. Plus I happen to be a sucker for beer bottles that do not have paper label and incorporate the label as part of the bottle, it really added to the experience because it shows the though about every detail of their product and not just good tasting beer, but it shows they even cared about the presentation and culture of their product."

"Overall I think this is a fine beer, though the grape flavor throws me. I like everything else about it. I rarely buy 750's and would probably opt for another offering from Unibroue before picking this up again."

"Overall- Good to really good beer. A must try and a possible gateway beer for a wine drinker. No flaws and very solid. Needs a little something more to attain that wow factor."
""
""
""
""
"O: Overall, this was pretty good. Although I've had many beers from Unibroue, I'd say this might be my least favorite but that does not at all mean it's bad, it's very good. I just feel that I like all their other beers, especially Don de Dieu. Still, i recommend it."
""
"Overall. 4's across the board, can't be a bad thing. A quality brew for sure. If you like one Unibroue, you'll probably like them all."
"O: alcohol very well hidden on this gem. Loved sharing this beer."
""
""
""
"Aroma of Belgian yeast with cloves and lots of roasted dark malts with candied plums. Has incredible depth and complexities that are totally beyond my abilities to describe. Likewise with the taste, that starts sweet and morphs into a finish that is simultaneously both dry and caramelized. As I have no idea how that is possible, will leave it for the experts to describe. The alcohol warmth is scarily well hidden, and I am glad to be sharing this bottle."
""
""
""
"i was ready to be totally embarrassed reading my first ever beer review, but i totally stand by this. terrible kicks ass, and i sounded how i should. honest and new. four or five years later, i don't have the time to write beer reviews, but i brew when i can. i have a few recipes posted on brewtoad. nothing so far like la terrible, but i think they're good recipes."
"the alcohol is well hidden as I am pretty drunk of sharing a bottle with a friend, and cant detect the 10.5 abv. very pleasant and complex beer. 2 thumbs up"
"Add this one to the beers you must have by Unibroue. Expressive in the glass from it's stately appearance to it's sumptuous flavors. This beer is vigorous and bewitching."

"Pours an opaque brown with a foamy khaki head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace slowly drip into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is of malt, caramel, dark fruit, and spice aromas. Taste is much the same with sweet malt and dark fruit flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of spice bitterness and an alcohol kick on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp and prickly mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer with nice fruity flavors but it's fairly boozy in my opinion."

"O: Another home run from Unibroue. I'm a big fan of cherry flavors, but if you are not, this beer could be off-putting. Regardless, dark Belgian fans need to check this one out for a great experience."
""
"This is a very Belgian beer with some Saison qualities. Very strong smell, fruity and yeasty. Cherries, plums, spice and other dark fruits. Taste adds some subtle malts. A little sweet for me, but it does well to mask the 11% ABV. Nice warming touch but no boozy taste. Crisp and sour, with lots of carbonation. Very drinkable."

"O: Didn't know what to expect from the bottle's description (Dark ale on lees with spices added), but very pleasantly rewarded. I daresay it beats out some of Belgium's better Strong Dark Ales. Huge complexity, extremely well balanced, and ultra satisfying, it can be consumed on both on a cold winter night and on a hot summer day. Highly recommended. Unibroue can do no wrong in my eyes."
""
""
"Overall: A really great Belgian style dark ale. Great mix of yeasty, juicy, and spicy flavors. Like a really good Dubbel."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I really enjoyed this one. Like I said before, dangerous is the key word here - this could perhaps be chugged. There's enough flavor and complexity to make one want to sit and savor this instead...and last time I checked, that's the hallmark of a great beer."
""
""
"My taste buds have been mesmerized. This ale is just so complex, and so... delightful. La Terrible... to call itself that I think this beer is just being ""modeste."""

"Poured from a bottle into a snifter, the beer pours a very dark, brown-to-black coloring with hazelnut highlights under light and a dense, creamy, foamy, light tan head that starts around an inch and a half and slowly settles into a solid, enduring half inch. Aromas of charred wood, earth, darkly rich fig and date, booze, black cherries, hints of molasses, and a bready backbone to support all of this. This is a layered, deep brew from the smell of things. Flavors are incredibly smooth, with a dark fruit blend of date, fig, black cherries, and currants on the forward tongue. More richly sweet characteristics like molasses and brown sugar open up the more you drink and the more the beer warms and agitates. Wow, this is smooth and tasty. Surprisingly easy to drink despite the richness and whopping ABV. There is carbonation action going on throughout the body as you drink, and as smooth as this beer is, I can only imagine without the carbonation it would be deathly heavy. Very well crafted beer. The aftertaste is wine-like with all of the old world fruit characteristics lingering about, giving off an almost port quality. Continues with the rich and smooth feel and taste into a slow lingering, clean, slightly rich and dry finish. This is a whopper, and amazingly drinkable, which spells trouble. Wow!"

"750 ml bottle into signature tulip glass, best before 11/15/2016. Pours fairly crystal clear dark reddish brown color with a 2 finger dense and fluffy khaki head with incredible retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Nice dense soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a ton of streaming carbonation retaining the thick head. Aromas of big raisin, prune, fig, plum, apple, pear, molasses, toast, dark candi sugar, bread, clove, light pepper, bubblegum, and yeast earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of yeast ester notes with a good dark malt balance; and good strength. Taste of big raisin, prune, fig, plum, pear, molasses, toast, clove, pepper, bubblegum, dark bread, chocolate, dark candi sugar, and yeast earthiness. Slight fruity tartness on the finish; with lingering notes of light and dark fruits, molasses, dark candi sugar, toast, dark bread, clove, light pepper, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a while. Fantastic complexity and balance of fruity ester flavors with a big dark malt backbone; and zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a slick, creamy, and slightly syrupy mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a fantastic Belgian strong dark ale. Great complexity and balance of fruity ester and malt flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the gravity. A highly enjoyable offering as expected."
""
"Anyways, delicious stuff."
""
""
"Pours very black with little of an off tan head. Dark fruits and very pungent cherries. This beer has a massive sweet cherry note. Almost like koolaid. A syrupy beer. Thick in flavor and texture. A lot of the Belgian yeast comes though ads a good bit of spiciness. A bit of caramel and bit of breddyness. A sweeter beer. High carbonation. Smooth in feel and not a lot of sting. Overall, pretty darn good stuff, a strong beer with dark cherry notes and other dark fruits."
""
"Not my favorite of the style, but pretty damn good for sure. I'd definitely get it again, especially considering the always great price point of Unibroue brews which are always satisfying and well done."

"O: I'm just going to come out and say that I am absolutely in love with everything Unibroue makes (Except one beer in particular, which I won't name names[Maudite]) But this is actually pretty different from any of their other offerings I've had. Very complex and enjoyable. I love the depth of flavor which comes with no cost to the drinkability. If this beer wasn't 10.5% I could drink it all night. Another reason Unibroue has my vote for top 3 breweries on the continent."

"O Refer to the first word in the review. I wasn't expecting a whole lot when I grabbed the beer from the fridge, other than the fact that I had just finished a major research paper and it's time to drink some high abv on a Wednesday night. Really impressed with this. Almost like a really complex 10.5% pop. Of course you can't get it in NB, but given the opportunity I'll pick this up again."

""
""
"Overall: It would be a good idea to share this bomber, but I didn't mind spending the afternoon sipping on it, reading some more dostoevski, and eating a ham and cheese sandwich. This beer is definitely a very pleasant sipper on some colder days, and if the rest of unibroue's beer is as good as this is, I'm going to have to find more."

"Overall: love the flavour and easy-drinking body, but could probably use a year to mellow out"
""
"Overall a great beer. If you like dark Belgians a must try. Unibroue calls this an abbey style, it's listed here as a dark Belgian. I don't know which it is but I really like it. Sometimes abbeys have a licorice smell or taste which I don't like even faintly and this one doesn't have that. Maybe that's why I like so well. Another great beer from one of the best breweries in North America. I never thought unibroue could produce a better dark than trois pistoles but this is it."

" These two beers taste delicious. I was surprised by the Terrrible. It taste's better than La Fin. I am not a brew meister by any stretch of the imagination, so in my ignorance I ask myself, what in the hell makes Terrible so dark. Is it food coloring? It taste incredible and takes you off the edge of the world with its higher content rating., which is the real reason I drink beer. La Fin de Monde will always be my first love, but I am quickly turning to the dark side. The only thing terrible about Terrible is its price, and of course the ever so ironic name."

"Overall this is a great beer. Not terrible. I'm not usually into Belgian strongs but this has a great balance between dark fruit/malt/spice/yeast."

"O- Overall I think this a wonderful interpretation of a Belgium strong ale. I really like the fact that it wasn't too sweet. Not to mention the alcohol was very well hidden. Although not complex it was very tasty be careful with this one being as the alcohol is well hidden it can sneak up on you. Another fine offering from Unibroue."
""
"D - An all around exceptional BSDA, and possibly one of Unibroue's best; this brewery really can do no wrong. This is probably even sweeter than the average BSDA, but at no point does it become at all cloying. Just an excellent beer in all respects, and one I'll be stocking up on the next time I see it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Overall, for 10.5%, this was pretty damn good. The sweetness could be toned down a bit however."
""
"Final Grade: 4.34, an excellent A grade. Unibroue's La Terrible is a behemoth of a beer, to be sure, but 'terrible' is still one of the absolute last adjectives I'd consider using to describe it. It is big and bold in every sense of those words, with all the intense yeasty, spicy, orchard-fruity goodness one might expect from an 'authentic' BSDA out of Belgium. As much as I like this, I think Maudite is still my favourite of the two brews - the combination of spice and abv in this one limits how much I could reasonably slug back before it became tiresome. That being said, it's undeniably amazing stuff, and anyone who has enjoyed one of Unibroue's other Belgian-style dark ales previously should consider seeking this one out - it's a must try."

"I can see why the beer manager at Total Wine likes this one. It’s great. This beer is only going to get better as it heats up, too. This is a rare beer, and only available at a few bottle shops in the United States. Glad I have one right down the road. I will be buying this one again, that’s for sure. I would LOVE to have this one with some nice cheeses or some smoked salmon. Great, now I am hungry! If you like beer, heck… even if you don’t, get a bottle of this. You’re welcome!!!"

"On tap at Kickbacks in Jax. Poured into a snifter. Khaki head, moderate retention, oily and soapy lacing. Body is deep mahogany, approaching black. Aroma includes dates, figs, raisins, toffee, brown sugar, candi sugar, slight roasted malt, sweet caramel malt, and a classic Unibroue yeast. Taste is dominated by sweet malt, Belgian yeast, clove, banana (underlying), touch of licorice and some mild spicing (hard to describe). No alcohol whatsoever noted on aroma or taste and amazingly drinkable at this ABV. Spectacular."
"Overall, an interesting brew. I'd get it again for its complexity."

"O: A very interesting BSDA by Unibroue, again. Last time I had this I didn't have time for a review, which is unfortunate since I didn't pay nearly as much attention to its complexity until now. Overall its a very rich yet almost simple ale considering its spiced. The spices take a back seat to the ride, which is how it should be. A great BSDA that is easy to drink, and packs a punch. Well balanced and great for desert. Next thing on my list would be to age a bottle and also to try this side by side with Trois Pistoles."
""
""
"Very dark brown in colour, just over a finger of tan head, quite a bit of lace at the end of the glass. Smell is a dark fruit overload, plum and raisin, spicy, yeasty with a bit of brown sugar as well, vinious points. Taste is yeasty with a bunch of dark fruit, dark breadt malt, only a touch of sweetness and alcohol, spicy finish with some darker sugars. Medium-high carbonation, big chewey full body, creamy at times. Just an outstanding beer, complex and dangerously drinkable, grweat stuff."
""
"Overall - A complex and enjoyable Belgian strong dark ale by Unibroue. There are so many flavours playing on the palate. Almost wine-like. ABV is so well concealed this could be quite dangerous! If you find a bottle in your local shop, don`t forget to pick one up."
""
""
"Drinkability: It's a very smooth drinkable beer accompanied with great flavors and aromas."
""

"O: Very interesting BSDA. Super spicy, black pepper and almost chile pepper-like sting. I almost wonder if these are off flavors because I don't see much mention of them. Regardless, loaded with dark fruits and sweet caramel throughout. Might have to retry this one some day, it's not past its prime but something is definitely up with the relatively harsh spiciness. I actually ended up drain pouring it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Bottle pours a dark black, chestnut brown with lots of head. Tastes of oak, dark fruits and slight caramal in a nice roasty finish. Its not as overwhelming in flavour as other Unibroue beers are. For 10.5% this drinks down quite smooth and the alcohol is well hidden. I think I will try to grab another bottle or two of this before it disappears."
""
"Might snap up a couple of bottles to hold on to in the cellar. Certainly a very strong offering from Unibroue, but it's in such tough company it's hard to notice a great difference between this and some of their other brews (with the high price under consideration!) Still, well worth a pick up, and quite enjoyable indeed!"
""
""
""
""
"One of the best beers I've had and it rivals anything from Belgium. Overall it's just an amazing beer. Has strong, aggressive smells and flavors and it all hits hard. But it never goes overboard. Something I could easily drink every night."
""
""
"O – A wonderful example of a truly flavor packed, powerful dark brew with loads of character and a respectable 10.5 abv. Been a staple of my cold-weather beer line up since the first time I tried it"
""
""
""
"O: a fantastic and complex Belgian. Well worth the buy."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall – The booze was well hidden and it's quite drinkable given the ABV. For my money trois pistoles (which is also available in a smaller format) is just as good if not better. Still another fantastic beer from this brewer and I'm looking forward to seeing how a bit of age affects the rest of my bottles."

"It's a lot like Trois Pistoles, but a little stronger. Trois Pistoles is on the lighter side of Belgian dark ales, and this is in the middle. This beer stands along all of Unibroue's lineup of great beers. Unfortunately, it's a little pricier."
""
"Overall: Not as great as i remember a few years ago but still quite good."
""
""
""
""
"Overall this is a pretty serious beer that really derserves to be laid down for a few years for the flavors to mellow and simmer a little. In my opinion most Dark Belgian ales over 10%ABV need at least a year in the cellar but ideally 3, this is no different as fresh it is a bit rough around the edges."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Atmosphere is pretty good. Deep, dark appearance with a decent head, but no real lacing. Nose is a great combination of malt, chocolate, and fruit. Nice and woody, too. Flavor is fruity malt goodness. Overall, this is a really good quaff."
""
""
"La Terrible has a rather light flavor for a dark beer, and a rather bright tang for brew that coats like a thin syrup. I think my wife summed it up best: it looks like winter and tastes like spring. In retrospect I’m glad I didn’t age this bottle very long, because now I want to buy another bottle and see it what it tastes like in a couple years."
""

"Overall strong. yet smooth for its ABV, very rich, beautiful Mahogany color. would recommend to a beer connoisseur like myself. Glad I tried it."
""
""
"Full bodied, very light effervescence, tart and almost smooth. Drink this beer."
"Pours a dark molasses colored brown with one and a half finger off-white head that resembles sea foam in consistency that dissipates quickly. No visible lacing. Dark fruit especially notes of black cherry and fig, a bit of spice, and light phenol alcohol on the nose. Opens with the flavor of black cherries and bit of date and fig that combines with hints of almond and spice. Finishes clean and fairly dry with some alcohol warmth. On the lighter side of medium bodied, fizzy champagne-like carbonation, slick on the palate. A very solid brew. There's nothing necessarily novel about this brew, however a good solid representation of the style."
""
"A dark ale. I tend to like this style. This style tends to be the sweeter of the dark ales. Can sense a bit of hops, but less than others in the style that I have tried. Overall, a good balanced blend. This was a total impulse buy for me. I'd definitely get another bottle to have in the future. It was definitely not terrible as it's namesake implies. If you have a penchant for dark Belgians (like I do), give this one a go. It is 750ml of goodness."

"Dark amber pour, inch head, very fine lacing. Scent is of apricot, almond, a little licorice, leather. A lot of carbonation in the mouthfeel though balanced. I taste citrus, hint of vanilla, lavender, blossoming into mild cacao and lemongrass, with a bit of nuttiness in the aftertaste. My first Unibroue, was pleasantly surprised by it, I'll have to look out for more in the future."
""
"Overall a very good beer. Probably a great one if you're a big fan of the style."
" I like how the yeast and sugar in this combines to give a hint of candied orange rind with the dark sugar providing some rum-like body with mild alcohol and sweetness in the middle there is slight nutmeg-like woody spice that carries over from the yeast and adds complexity with a nice mild creamy toffee note in the finish. Overall I though this is a solid belgian with a nice amount of flavor and has some interesting spice and fruit notes."
""
""
"This is a big beer. The alcohol is noticeable and slows down the drinking a good deal. The flavor is fruit forward but good. I would probably prefer a little more balance and a little less of the apple notes, but good nonetheless."

"M: Medium bodied; Biscuity mouth feel, great carbonation, and a nice touch of alcohol really helps to move the beer along as well as keep the palate refreshed. A bit of a warminmg effect, but at 10.5% ABV not harsh at all. Great brew, if cellared even better."
"A votre sante! / Cheers!"

"La Terrible is not as the name suggests. This is a wonderful Belgian-styled beer that is more than satisfying."
"Awesome. Unibroue has yet to let me down and with Terrible, they've set the bar even higher for themselves. Sweet, yeasty with a slight malt background. Definitely a must try for any Belgian fan."

"O-Excellent beer with great flavor and feel. Had never heard of it but had other Unibroue beers that I enjoyed. This one is great as well"

"Oh, boy. Now you're talking. Finally an Unibroue I can really love. The others (Maudite, Trois Pistoles, ___) have been quite good, but overwrought in one way or another, either too sweet or too rich. Perhaps it's the bottle conditioning of the Terrible that attenuates the flavors and creates more room for error. The yeast fruit definitely adds a dimension to distract somewhat from any flaw, as does the high carbonation. (A note on the bottle-conditioned carbonation: while being a bit sharp in the mouth, it is fought off so well by creamy mouth feel that what carbonation would be a liability in most beers here is an unwavering asset.)"
"Overall – This was one very nice and tasty brew. It had some great dark fruit flavors with just the right hint of warming alcohol to make it very easy to sit back and sip with enjoyment."
""
"4.5 D: Very good beer. It's been a long time since I had a Belgian style beer this good. Solid all around. Don't pay much attention to the label, this is anything but terrible."
"Poured a brownish body with a one-finger offwhite head that left some lace down the glass. A candi-sugar and yeast sweet aroma, along with touches of dark fruit and something like figs. Medium-bodied and easy passing although a tad bready/filling, a nice balance of candi and caramel sweetness as well as some light touches of dark fruits (cherries, apricots, figs, touches of citric orange - my tastebuds are all over the place). Finishes a little dry and crisp and not as boozy as one would think with high ABV."

""
"O: Complexity is great on this one. This may surpass Maudite as my favorite. As has become my habit, I love mixing the yeast sediment in my second glass when it comes to Unibroue brews. It did not disappoint."
""
"O: Great. It is soothing and delicious, very easy to finish."
""
""
"Overall a very nice version of this style. Complex and delicious with food. I would have again."
"Poured into a 10oz glass. Dark, rich color. The server had a little trouble with the pour, spooning off a little of the head and topping up a couple of times. Ended up with a 2 finger head that was retained well with little lacing. Slight cherry aroma that complimented the rich, complex, fruity taste. Velvety mouthfeel that you would expect from a strong dark ale, but little in the way of boozy taste."
""
""
"O: This brew needs to be opened at cellar temperature. At colder temps, the flavor and aroma are practically useless, but the aroma really steps up with a couple of degrees on it. While the flavor is good, it *is* somewhat simple. I almost regret opening this beer now as it clearly still has some aging potential."
""
"O- This almost four year old elixer is damn near perfection! So beautiful with sweetness and touches of sour fruit. Caramel, vanilla, dark fruit and subtle touches of alcohol. It dances on the tongue and asks No Quarter... No Forgiveness, No Shame of it's age. I'm so happy I opened this, yet so sad that I didn't give it five more years... Time to age some more and hope for the best!!!"

I wish for a fuller body, but it's a small gripe in this case. Defiantly worth a try. If you want a good Canadian beer, this is one of them, I would recommend. Another bottle worthy of the self.

"O-I've had this a few times but i really can't justify the price. the brewery makes many great beers, and i'm not sure why they consider this one special enough to a limited edition beer. i'd rather have trois pistoles or maudite than this. its definitely worth a try but too much of a mess for a go to dark belgian"

"Poured from a 22 oz bottle into a goblet, best before 4-15-2015. This pours very dark brown almost a black with a very short lived white head. The smells are of a little alcohol heat, some dark malts, ripe fruit. The feel is medium to thick with high carbonation. The taste is pretty good, the sweet malts are present but not too sweet, some noticeable alcohol heat, some dark fruit, prunes."

"A deep brown beer with light lacing. Roasted notes on the nose with a hint of belgian funk / barnyard. The body has a sweetness that lingers with a touch of roasted and oddly enough, though enjoyable, a corny sweetness. Crisp carbonation with a sweet finish. A tasty belgian beer, but nothing to differentiate itself from an average belgian beer. Not bright and it needs a little more subtlety to be great."

"Overall, I think is a great Belgian Strong Dark Ale and the sweet characteristics are enjoyable without a cloying feel. Very nice."
"O - This was an excellent beer. I wish I could get this locally to I could stock up the cellar."
"The aroma has the flavor of sweet fruits and some dark fruit. There is a bit of clove and just a hint of cocoa. It is pretty good, but not outstanding."
"An easy drinker, and dangerous at 10.5%. Very worth trying. I like that this can be sipped over time and thoroughly enjoyed without being completely in the tank from the booze. Another winner from this brewer."
"Pours a dark brown with crimson highlights if held to the light. Beautiful coffee colored two finger head, which sticks around a bit, and slowly disappears to a sliver. Fig, clove, apple, and toast are what I pick up on the nose. It's not as complex as some of the best in this style (Belgians), but it's still very well done. The taste is nice- although pretty dry for my taste. The fruits, spices, toast all come through- but the beer is so dry they evaporate off my tastebuds and there's only a mild aftertaste left. None of the 10.5% alcohol is felt or noticed. Feel is a little thin and dry for what the best in this style brings. The flavor has potential, it just never really gets to open up IMO... Overall, a very good beer- but not quite up to the Rochefort 8's, Cuvee de Kaiser Blau on the style list. Still, this is a totally solid brew, and just a few minor changes away from straight 4.5's. I enjoyed drinking it- Cheers!"
"O- a tart and carbonated dark ale with champagne and wine like tastes it a great brew"
"Nice surprise to find this on draft locally, and at $4 a chalice it's a hell of a value. Plum and grapes, toffee and a dusting of cocoa powder. Bit of old earthiness adds depth and alcohol is as tame as a lot of beers of less strength. Yeast throws off a little black pepper and clove. Not as impressive as the bottled version, but Unibroue does dark Belgian ales right."
"O-A good beer that did not disappoint."
"Overall this is an amazing beer. It is a pleasant drink with a lot of crazy flavor. Unibroue does it again."
"O: This may be one of my new favorite Unibroue beers now.... or maybe it's just because I haven't had one in a while. No matter. This stuff is great!"
"My advice to all is, buy a few bottles (they're cheap!!), stick them somewhere reasonably cool for a few years, then pop them open on a special occasion. You won't be disappointed."
"some previous reviews mentioned the strong taste of alcohol. i couldnt agree less. the alcohol is masked brilliantly by hints of spice and slight toffee/caramel. unlike a quad more carbonated mouthfeel. dont know about this being a session beer but not bad in the least"
"O: It's okay. Alcohol is well hidden for what it's worth."
"Pours a nearly opaque dark brown. One-finger tan head quickly recedes to a thin cap. Smells of dark cherries, tannins, and warm alcohol reminiscent of brandy. Tastes of apples and cherries, with some oak. Alcohol warmth is in-your-face. This beer boldly announces its high ABV and makes no attempt to disguise it - and why should it? Be proud of your inebriating abilities! Full-bodied, chewy mouthfeel makes this a nice after-dinner sipper on a cool autumn evening."
"Overall - Almost perfect. I expect a little bit more in my nose, but everything else was top notch. I can't get over how amazing it felt going down."
"78."
"Overall: This Belgian Strong Dark Ale is very drinkable and very complex. I would buy again."
"O: Very drinkable Belgian Strong Dark Ale with complex smell and flavours. I would buy this again in a heartbeat."
"O: Very tasty, but I think I enjoy trois pistoles better. I'll have to check out unibroue's other offerings to figure out my favorite. Might buy again, but not if I have trois pistoles/rochefort 10/van de keizer blauw and other great belgian offerings instead."
"O - Overall a fine beer, it combines flavors very nicely."
"Good brew but not the best we had that night (Dark Lord 2010)"
"This beer is worth the money, as it tastes fantastic, and is somewhat refreshing."
"Overall it's ok and a very good value."
"O - Overall a fine beer, it combines flavors from styles and influences that I love in a highly successful way. I would love to drink this around Christmastime, it is just so warm and comfortable."
"Overall I really enjoyed this beer. It was interesting and complex, definitely making me work to figure out what went into it. Big and boozy, but spicy and delicious at the same time. Definitely worth the buy."
"The bottle simply states ""Dark Ale"" ... nothing about Belgian ... which makes a big difference in my opinion. I'm not a fan of the yeasty flavors which seem to be present in nearly every Belgian beer I've tried. That said, the high ABV is nicely hidden, and there are some interesting flavors present (clove in particular). I like the sweetness and the minimal hop bite, but overall I'm unhappy with my selection."
"Overall, La Terrible is the king of the Unibroue BSDAs, with an ultra aromatic nose, intense and complex flavours, and surprisingly good drinkability given its weight. I highly recommend this sumptuous brew."
"La Terrible is a very good beer, but it kind of has that plain, smoothed-over flavor that all of the dark Unibroue's seem to have, which makes it a bit boring in the end. Far from Terrible though!"
"overall i thought this was really good. no 'wow' factor per se, but very enjoyable nontheless. great beer."
"Smell was bready and typical of the style. Nothing interesting or different. Taste was excellent as there were hints of raisins and dark fruits in general along with some spiciness. It's possible this beer had some age on it since the alcohol was not very detectable as the 10.5% label suggested. This might be my favorite Unibroue beer; just wish I could get it in a place other than a smokey bar."
"Overall this is a very good dark ale, this bottle had a few years aging in my cellar, which probably tamed it down and smoothed it out. Great job Unibroue."
"Mouthfeel has a prickle to it, medium bodied and somewhat dry. I like it. Smooth, almost a little oily, with a lingering bitterness at the very end of the sip."
"O: I am a big fan of this beer. Not as aggressive as many Belgian-style ales, it balances the flavors nicely and still packs a punch of flavor (and alcohol). Not incredibly complex, not out of the ordinary or original or anything of the sort, but there is something to be said for just a solid, Belgian style beer that's incredibly easy to drink. Worth seeking at for sure."
"I can recall begging Sleeman reps for a long time with no success to let me sell this bad boy and was told I could keep dreaming. To say I was pissed off buying this at a ""competitor"" here in Calgary is an understatement. I'm concerned that Sleeman doesn't want the business of one of their best customers in the province. I'm very worried for the Albertan consumers of Unibroue at this rate. I struggle remembering Don Du Dieu and at this rate all their beautiful beers will be a distant memory and I want to barf as a result, not booze induced vomit, just disgusted with the situation kinda spew"
"6.3/10"
"Overall - Tastes good, but not complex. Apples aren't my favorite flavor in beer. Just tastes like cider to me."
"Overall: Definitely glad I finally got around to trying it. I’ll need to pick up a bottle and throw it in the cellar to see how it develops."
"A complex and spicy BSDA. One I'd love to try again--good thing I have a couple bottles waiting for me at home."
"it was very good for me to find this at one of our local bars since it was only $15 and that's all I had to spend to be set for the night. The alcohol I think is a little much but I think a little aging will help"
"O - Some age on this one and it came across as a very smooth beer, no biting. Very tasty. Loved it."
"O - Overall an incredibly tasty dark Belgian and certainly a solid example of the style. Too bad this isn't readily available in Canada, as it would be a wonderful celebratory ale to enjoy on occasion. I will definitely pick up a couple bottles the next time I come across some."
"The beer is a excellent price that provides a timelessly classic appeal. There is nothing new about any of these flavors, but they are organized in a way that provides immediate enjoyment. I could definitely see myself drinking this beer all night long and not growing tired of its simplicity. Definitely try this beer and I would recommend the bottle over draught (which is served waaayyy to cold)."
"Overall a very nice dark ale with a nice combo of dark sour fruits and big malts."
"Wow, I was seriously, seriously impressed. One of the best random surprises I've had down at Bodega all year. The kind of beer that makes me want to rush out and get a couple bottles. And that's what I love about Unibroue. Cheap, easy to find and better than most rare trade fodder."
"O- Not my type of beer but it reminds me of typical dark belgian, like a sweeter Rochefort. I'll keep the other bottles I bought to let them age. We'll see how to turn out after a few months/years."
"O- This beer was very enjoyable to drink, there were many complex layers to both flavor and smell."
"Will defenetly buybthis one again, a must try brew."
"The beer poured out as a muddy brown color with a light tan head on it. The nose was spicy and had a bit of a booze smell going on. The taste was really good at first then it had a bit of a metallic flavor, I was worried that this was going to be the way the rest would taste but it went away. The flavors that remained were of spice, booze and some earthy bread in the aftertaste. The mouthfeel wasn't too bad, overall a pretty decent brew."
"Overall-A good strong ale that I will likely buy again when I am looking for a reliable, quality ale to serve with a dessert or even as a dessert."
"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was how it was so typically Unibroue, with the yeast and dark flavoring, but also how it deviated from that archetype. What was most notably different was the lactic sourness through the middle of the flavor profile, lending an undeniably unique aspect to the beer."
"O- pretty damn good. quite sweet, with a touch of boozyness but it seems to work together. very good."
"Medium mouthfeel and very little notice of the alcohol, which surprises me. Overall, an outstanding brew."
"Worth a try."
"VI) Concluding thoughts: Great Unibroue beer. One of my favorites!"
"Overall - Very very tasty. Cant help but feel that this is a stronger version of Trois Pistoles though, ill need to drink one of them real soon. Fantastic beer, 22oz is more then enough. After this warmed up, all the fruits really came out."
"Overall it's not bad, but I probably wouldn't seek it out."
"It was our annual trip to Tampa...the night before THE BUCKEYE CRUISE AGAINST CANCER!!!! The better half and I walked a couple of blocks down from our hotel and found a wonderful sport to taste numerous different brews. The fourth beer I tried, thanks to the suggestion of our server...was the Unibroue La Terrible. I am not a Belgium beer fan....so please disregard my review for those that love Belgium beers. The color was a dark and opaque. The nose included alcohol and a hint of spice and plum. The taste included clove, alcohol, dark fruit, and maybe some addtionial spice. I could not drink very much of this...tooo much ABV!"
"O - Another gorgeous Belgian by Unibroue. Delicious."
"O: Classic Belgian flavors, classic Belgian carbonation, and a wonderfully complex flavors make for a pretty good beer. Drink this a little warmer, and the mouthfeel and flavor really develop."
"This beer pours a dark brown with a trace of off white head that does not retain or leave any lacing. The aroma has hints of blackberry, oak and banana. The taste resembles Hefeweizen characteristics with notes of spice and bananas and finishes very sweet. The mouthfeel is a bit overcarbonated. Overall a very unique beer and I suggest trying it."
"O - This is a very solid offering with great aroma and flavor, nice complexity and overall enjoyability."
"Overall, I'm a fan. I'm looking forward to the next glass and would definitely drink this again. The price makes it an occasional beer, but that's about par for the course of BSDAs."
"Pours a cola brown color with a retaining tan color head that grows to about a fingers width after an aggressive pour. This is a great smelling beer. Lots of deep dark fruits made up of dark cherries, raisins, plums, and sweet fig. The belgian yeast scents are also present. Taste isn't quite as dominated with fruits as the nose is but very complex. Lots of yeast and brown sugar. A lingering malt and bread stays on the palate. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and well carbonated. Overall this is a good belgian dark. Complex and delicious, also will do well in the cellar."
"This beer is pretty thick and very smooth, given the abv, its extremely drinkable and leaves a nice wet aftertaste."
"Overall this is a really good brew, a sipper for sure, but a nice treat."
"A fantastic BSDA, and another winner from Unibroue! Seems very similar to Trois Pistoles, would have to do a side-by-side to really notice any differences."
"Pours a black color that turn red around the edges when held to light. Large, light tan head that stick around for quite some time. Scent is quite lovely. Inviting dark fruit aromas with some nice spices...maybe a bit of cinnamon as well. I also get some nice Belgian yeast aromas. Taste is just as good as it smells! Haven't had this beer in a while, and I'm sure glad I grabbed one today. Nice, complex blend of dark fruits and green apples. I also get some nice spices and delicious Belgian yeast notes. A bit of alcohol burn at the end, especially as the beer gets less cold. Tastes like a Unibroue beer, that's for sure! Mouthfeel is full-bodied, creamy, and even a tad bit syruppy. Drinkability is high."
"Pours a dark dark red. Great aroma of dried fruits and yeasty Belgian funk. Taste follows, with dried fruit, currants, apricots, and more of that Unibroue funk. A nice treat, takes a red wine and removes the bitter tanin taste and just leaves the great fruit flavors. Gets better as it warms. Booze is VERY well hidden making this a dangerous but wonderful brew."
"Pours a near porter like dark brown with khaki colored head, decent retention and lacing. Scent is big and bold... sweet dark fruits, dried fruit and hints of red wine, burnt sugar and carmel in the background with faint notes of pumpernickle, much more muted malt and yeast impact than expected from the style. Taste is smoother than the bold scent dictatedd, but still all about sweet dark fruits, touches of dark red wine and again a muted malt profile that is more burnt than sweet sugar. Medium bodied, quite smooth. A nice Belgian style that puts the focus away from the malt for a bit."
"Notes: Overall this is a very well made beer from a solid brewery."
"D - Grew on me alot. Great sweetness but not cloying. Delicious."
"Very enjoyable and certainly one of the more complex beers out there. Every sip seems to unearth a new flavor. Thankfully its a 750ml bottle which holds quite a few sips."
"D- idk this was not bad by any means its just an odd taste for me. it doesnt at all come across like a BSDA. But it is good and i would drink it again."
"This brew is easily my favorite of Unibroue's Dark Belgians, the complexity makes for a very enjoyable experience. If you're a fan of any of the Belgian Trappist ales then this is definitely for you. Must try."
"O: Quite good and FANTASTIC VALUE. Perhaps one of the best bang for your buck purchases out there."
"D- Cool for a hot minute ! 1 - 2 glasses . aight !"
"Mouthfeel / Drinkability - Very smooth and tart. Light cherry and other fruits. Very consistent throughout. One of the better offerings from Unibroue."
"Good stuff. Sweet, malty, fruity, boozy goodness. Drink it."
"D - dark belgians always seem to have a unique character and this is no exceptions, high octane brew that warms the insides and is very drinkable at 10.5%"
"A solid beer and a great example of the style. Another Unibroue classic."
"I know I compared this to Trois Pistoles a lot but I really do feel like they're damn close. I do think I like this one better but I'd definitely like to try a side by side tasting."
"D: very drinkable in smaller amounts, due to the sweetness and alcohol content. I shared the pint with a friend since I had to do some driving later. If I wasn't getting behind the wheel, I think a pint would have been plenty for me. Not a beer I'd drink all night."
"750mL bottle poured into a tulip glass. Pours almost deep dark brown with an off-white head. The aroma has plenty of dark fruit, yeast, spices, and sugar. Complex taste, similar to the smell. Medium-full bodied with a great mouthfeel. There is a little alcohol burn that becomes more noticeable as it warms, but no way you'd guess this is 10.5% abv. Another great beer from Unibroue!"
"This is a seasonal brew that is very affordable, value exceeds cost."
"6/10"
"D: I tried to drink this slowly (I had to drive home), but it was quite delicious. I figured it was fairly high ABV, but I have to admit, it didn't taste like 10.5% alcohol. This could easily catch you by surprise."
"Overall I liked this beer. I am more in favor of more earthy tones. But this beer is not too shabby. They nailed the flavors with the yeast but I can't rate this higher than a B. Good Strong Dark Ale"
"Verdict: Find and drink, very fine ale."
"Poured from 12 oz bottle into chalice glass. Pours a muddy dark brown with a light beige head. Smell is yeasty, almost cherry and gummy like, with raisins. Taste is creamy dark malt with raisins, dark fruity, belgian yeast, spices and bananas. Medium body and light carbonation."
"Pours a deep, heavy brown with a massive, dirty-tan head. The only thing I picked up on the smell and taste was belgian yeast and alchool. slightlt tarty and didn't last long in the mouth. I found this to be pretty bland and not up to Unibroue standards."
"Very easy drinking at 10.5%. As most Unibroue beers, this is a good beer that goes down all too quickly."
"The bright white grape character was unexpected but melded perfect. All the flavors seem so balanced that nothing sticks out. The drinkability is very high for the style. Alcohol is hidden well."
"D- Very easy to drink for a BSDA. One of the easiest to drink I've had so far. Hid the booze quite well. Most of the time a 9% Unibroue 750 will do it for me, so this is a pretty formidable drink."
"D - Quite the delicious Belgian Strong Dark. The only place I would knock it is in the aroma. The smells are wonderful but far too subtle for what I expect in the style."
"First of all, the La Terrible held up pretty well with aging except for the nose which I have to admit was disappointing. Generally, I think La Terrible is CLEARLY better than the Trois Pistoles and Maudite both from Unibroue and may well be Unibroue's best (or amongst the better) BSDAs. For this particular evaluation, the Pelican takes the lead for now though the Terrible has did really well though may not exactly be fair as the vintage years and aging conditions are different. Appearance, nose and nose and the feel probably has to go the Pelican but the taste is pretty competitive albeit on different vintage years."
"Great beer."
"750 mL bottle poured into a Duvel tulip glass. This is a dark brown color with an inch or so of fluffy head. Smells are sugary plums, grapes, and spices. Taste is an alcoholic dark fruit with a slight sweetness. Very drinkable for being 10%+. Thick mouthfeel. Very solid."
"D-The best part about the 750mL bottle is that as soon as I'm done I can refill my snifter, a fantastic brew, goes down smooth and is dangerously drinkable with the 10.5% abv."
"M- This one had a little more carbonation than i wanted but was an overall good delicious beer."
"Sweet up front and a bit heavy with a slightly bitter finish."
"Unibroue La Terrible has a dark brown colour and a head that fades quickly to a good amount of lacing. The smell is of sweet yeastiness (like apple cider) and alcohol. There is some spiciness in the aroma but I can't really pick out what it is exactly. This beer tasted sweet and tangy at first: dark and fruity. The yeast is noticeable and the aftertaste is fruity and alcoholic. This beer is foamy and reasonably thick. This beer is pretty strong and full on, sip it."
"The beer pours a dark reddish-brown color with an off-white head. The aroma is strong dark fruit with some Belgian candy sugar, roasted malt, molasses, chocolate and caramel malt mixed in. The flavor is just as nice. I get a ton of dark fruit - cherries, grapes, plums - as well as roasted malt, brown sugar and caramel. The alcohol is well hidden for a beer of this alcohol amount. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"Ive been eying this beer for about a year now at my local brew shop and finally decided to pick one up after hearing so much about it. The beer pored a deep brown, now quite black, but very dark brown/amber color. Smoke billowed out of the top after the cork popped right off. Immediately I could smell sweet sugars with hints of alcohol...almost a bit overbearing but at 10.5 I guess thats expected. Tasting this was a bit nice. Spices like coriander slight traces of tarragon were present...a bit of licorice notes. The alcohol is rather present but not as present as it was in the nose. Its slightly earthy and very complex...spicy undertones and a sweet finish make this a very nice session beer."
"But it sure does warm the tummy."
"I am relatively new at reviewing good beer. This beer is the reason I started. The smell of this beer almost reminded me of a cherry-dominated wine. There was quite a nice head upon first pour into a tulip glass. While I believe that there was a bit of heavy alcohol taste once I got a sip or two into it, overall the taste was amazing. The feeling in my mouth upon first sip is unbelievable...flowing with flavor. Furthermore, I found this beer to be exceptionally drinkable, as it did not ""fill me up"" as I thought it would."
"Very drinkable, though the alcohol becomes slightly more noticeable as the glass progresses. A well-balanced BSDA that is neither too sweet, nor too yeasty. Pairs very well with chocolate."
"yummy beer but very difficult to place. no overly defining characteristics. however still very good."
"Pours pitch brown/black with a bubbly tannish head. Smell is very much like a deep red wine; raisin, currant, and black cherry tones. Taste is sour and spicy, pretty sweet and complex. A bit of alcohol burn. Feel is viscous, yet effervescent. At 10.5%, drinks smoothly."
"D- Very pleased with another good offering from Unibroue, could drink this all day."
"D. Very drinkable. This revies is the first time that I have had La Terrible. This might be my new favorite Unibroue beer. Very smooth while being complex. Great beer."
"D - This one definitely packs quite a punch... Good in all categories, but there isn't anything quite memorable with this one... An average offering in one of my favorite styles..."
"The drinkability is off the charts. Definitely heading into accidentally drunk territory. I gave a sip to my roommate and he was shocked when I told him it was about quad strength. I'll enjoy finishing this bottle tonight and I'll be looking forward to drinking it again."
"I poured from a bomber into a snifter, deep, dark pour with a clingy little white head. Lots of molasses and dark fruit on the nose. The beer tast better than it smells, nice layers of complexity added to the dark fruit. It has a lingering hint of dates in the finish along with some warming alcohol. Definitely a full bodied sipper, nicely carbonated, warming alcohol throughout. A fine BSDA."
"D: The beer is incredibly drinkable and goes down very smoothly."
"Overall: I sampled La Terrible a few weeks back along with Warsteiner Oktoberfest, Punkin Ale, and Namaste. So these all blend together a bit in my memory. Fortunately, the colors are each unique. Anyway, I loved this, although not as much as La Fin Du Monde, which may be one of my 2 or 3 favorite beers out there. Unibroue delivers again here pretty well."
"Beer is medium bodied. Its sweet and has some good fruit esters in the beer. It tastes really nice, another good Belgian style beer from Unibroue."
"Mouth feel wise, it's not overly carbonated and smooth. There is a warm finish in the end."
"D: Definitely something to be consumed slowly. Very good, but I can't pound it back. I would drink it SLOWLY until I fell off my chair. Great."
"D: I hate to repeat myself, but it drinks like wine. If i ever cannot decide on beer or wine for an evening, i'll go straight to this guy's place on the shelf."
"Pours a nice dark brown with a light tan head. Some lace as it falls down my glass. Nose brings a touch of booze along with some light dark fruits and some dark candy sugar. The taste adds in a bit of darkened sugar or caramel...maybe some molasses. Good dark fruits with a bit of sweetness. Medium feel with good carbonation. This is a nice example of the style, and it seems like it would age quite well."
"A sipper, for sure. Heady, tasty and mean...terrible for your sobriety."
"d - A good strong ale. Not my favorite beer from Unibroue, but pretty good. Would have again."
"D: Another excellent and drinkable beer from Unibroue."
"Subtle dark fruits and many properties of Belgian ales make this one a good selection. It is very rich and full of flavor."
"Anyways, this Belgian style had a mix of vanilla bean, plum wine, and mild clove and spice. It was a little heavy, but on par for the style and strength. This is a great beer to share and sip from a red wine glass. There's subtle berry fruit flavors and mellow Belgian spices all building to create a deliciously big beer. Check it out."
"D: The mouthfeel is essential to me here since the taste is good but this one otherwise is below average. Very enjoyable to drink, not much to look or smell at, though."
"D: With a beer like this, you want to pace yourself, but worth seeking out when available."
"nice drink that I thoroughly enjoyed. I like a belgian ale that is able to properly balance the sweet & sour with the right amount of bitterness to mute the higher abv. goo drink."
"D- easy to finish this one, even though it seems a bit green. im hoping some time in the cellar does this one some good."
"Notes: A good offering from Unibroue, that definitely had a Belgian taste. Pretty bold, strong flavors gave it a feel that it wasn't perfectly balanced, but it didn't really seem out of balance. Overall it is an enjoyable beer that would be nice to have every once in awhile."
"Drinkability: At 10.5% ABV (and you can really taste the alcohol) it's not a terribly drinkable beer."
"Mouthfeel is full with a smooth amount of carbonation."
"D- Sip, and it's great to enjoy over a long time!"
"Pours very dark - you only see the slightest hint of a red/brown in the bottom of the goblet when held to the light. The light oatmeal colored head filled 1/3 of the glass and dropped to about a 1/2"" throughout the drinking. Smells very nice with a fruity notes with a hint of spice. The taste matches the smell. Here's where I'm torn - the first sip was very nice and a powerful mix of fruit and clove spice notes. The main issue I have is each sip got less enjoyable until by the end a kind of had to force down the last of the botle. Belgian darks are my favorite kind of beer and had I shared this 750ml with someone I think I would have given it a higher rating. Don't get me wrong, it's a pretty good beer but with what else is out there I don't know if I'll be coming back to it. I have one more bottle to try out (I won't throw something over based one test). The mouthfeel was very nice (slightly lighter than most) with lots of carbonation to sting the tongue. As for overall drinkability, I'd say above average, just not ""wow"". I'm looking for a cheaper alternative to my favorite European made Belgian Darks, was hoping this would be it but my search continues."
"This beer was a pleasure to drink. I will look forward to having this beer again another day!"
"Pours an extremely dark brown with a very finely beaded head that fades to a thin cap. Smells bready, sweet, and slightly spicy with typical Belgian yeast notes. Tastes a little sharp, but otherwise pretty much like the aromas with an additional hit of Belgian yeast spice, as well as some licorice and caraway. Fairly complex, but not necessarily a harmonious whole. Very smooth and a bit tangy in the mouth. Amazingly smooth for the huge abv makes this surprisingly drinkable. One of their better beers. I always enjoy this one."
"Delicious and very heavy. Something to enjoy slowly. Hides the alcohol okay. Totally worth trying."
"As a side note, this beer is absolutely excellent with colby jack cheese, green olives and crackers."
"A delicious beer that doesn't allow the abv to overpower your palate."
"Rather aggressive pour from 750 into a goblet, yielding a massive head, opaque black body, and a nose that had heavy dark grape notes, like a red wine. Also something that reminded me of the smell of a dentist office, for some reason. Lacing remained, with a little hill of foam in the center of the glass. Taste is big and powerful, though the booze is almost imperceptible; malty and very fruity. Raisin is dominant, very faint banana and spice, more so on the aftertaste. Sweet, almost syrupy, almost no tartness. No hops to speak of; a plus for me. Mouthfeel, as with all Unibroue offerings, is superb, heavy, very fine carbonation yields an incredibly creamy mouthfeel without cutting into flavor. Drinkability is good, but I couldn't finish a 750 in an evening; recommended to share. Could go well with steak or pungent (bleu?) cheese. Another fantastic Unibroue offering; hard to go wrong."
"Along with Fin Du Monde this is one of the crown jewels produced by Unibroue, IMO the best Belgian Style strong dark ale produced in North America."
"D - Loved this beer and will definitely buy again without thinking twice if I can find it!"
"Pours a very dark brown with nice head and lacing. Smell is of raisins and cherries with the Belgian yeast. Nice flavour of tangy dried fruit with the dark malt. Mouthfeel creamier than many other Belgian strong dark ales. This hides the alcohol really well. I find a lot to like about this beer, but the flavour isn't quite up there with the top of this style."
"At the Coppermine Pub in North Arlington, NJ. Poured black with slightly less than a finger of beige head, with average retention, little visible carbonation, and good lacing. Smelled of various dark fruit, plum, currant, and candi sugar. The taste was a tiny bit berry sweeter than the nose, starting on a blackberry/currant note, then progressing to a malty/candi sugar/dark fruit-blend midpalate, and then finishing on a sweet and sour note. Medium-bodied, yet spritzy and crisp on the palate. Excellent sipping beer."
"jd"
"I have had Unibroue Terrible on other occasions and this is the first time I have encountered this metallic soapy taste, so perhaps there are good and bad batches. With Unibroue becoming more commercial perhaps there is reason to expect they are losing that ""special touch"" that they once had."
"What can I say? I had this beer in April '10, and it's July '10 now... and it's still one of the most memorable beers I've had all year. Probably top 3. Unibroue, if you're reading this: pilot brew some La Terrible by putting it and some lacto into a barrel, or using some brett or something. This beer is AMAZING with some funk and sourness; those notes really make the sugary Belgian dark ale plum/prune, caramel, and smoke notes in Terrible SING. I am saying this emphatically enough to justify going all caps on it."
"Poured from 750ml bottle into tulip shaped glass. Dark red-brown and opaque with light only coming through at bottom of glass. Very rich light tan head with sticky lace. Aroma is fruity with a bit of alcohol present. Carbonation acidity up front that fades some as it warms. Rich, syrupy mouthfeel. Some alcohol present in middle and end, but otherwise well balanced. Taste is very port like, raisins and figs, with a touch of oakiness. Too big a beer for warm weather."
"Nice, split the bomber with someone."
"Pours a cola color with a small white head that doesnt leave much as it disappears. Aroma is of candied sugar, dark fruit, and a bit of spice. Taste is like the aroma. A nice blend of spice and dark fruit with an underlying yeastiness. Finish is slightly dry and tart. Pretty good beer."
"It's a dark ale that can brighten up a terrible day. Malty smooth and sweet, lares of flavors. Good to have a with a meal or by itself. I't very good at room temperature the finish has a little burn but not bad. Don't let the name fool you its just over all a nice beer."
"Black body topped by large off-white fluffy head. Subtle scent of raisins, prunes, booze, faint wet grass. Strong flavors of tang, prunes, grapes, alcohol rushes in towards the end but gets cleaned up by malty sweetness. Malty, heavy bodied brew with light carbonation. A milky quality to this tang-fest despite finding this ale not that filling on the stomach. Another example of pushing the limits of what a beer can be."
"IF you like Dark Belgian ales then this may be an awesome experience but I couldn't see myself digging too many beers of this style"
"Still this brewer's best offering."
"Interesting flavor...at first makes you think a dark wheat beer to take big gulps from, but then the alcohol and spices say 'slow down there big fella'. Very clove and nutmeg oriented and makes the ABV feel like 10% on the tongue, yet silky smooth all the way down with a nice belly warming. Good beer, but it seems like it could be great with a creamy, fuller body and dialing it back on the spices to let some malt and hops come through more. Will have no problem at all finishing this 750 though, drinkability is high for such a strong brew. Fun beer to drink and glad I finally got around to trying it, but there are a few other Unibroue beers that I like better."
"D - You are not going to session this, but you certainly can enjoy a 750 ml bottle. The balance lets you enjoy the higher alcohol without it feeling too harsh."
"D: Very drinkable beer, great to split a few bottles with a friend or have one to yourself. (Which is slightly surprising given the amount of flavor it has to offer)"
"This beer is highly recommended and will find its way into my fridge again soon."
"Served from tap into a Unibroue tulip. Pours a nice dark brown that is almost black with a nice three-finger tan head that lingers. There was minimal lacing evident throughout. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt with a hint of nuts. The flavor was sweet with bitter notes and alcohol. There is also a bitter aftertaste upon swallowing. It was medium on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a very nice brew. It is definitely the best one I have had from Canada thus far. The flavor was similar to a Chimay (Blue) only the flavors were a little more potent and also had the nice alcohol flavor."
"D - It is very good for Unibroue, as I find some of their brews to be actually terrible in ways beyond name."
"D: as mentioned above, this is one of the best BSDAs I've come across from this continent. It will even give many of the highly acclaimed Belgian breweries a run for their money. This is a must try of you can get your hands on it, and worth a trade if you can't."
"D: Obviously on the heavy side, and for the ABV it doesn't hide the alcohol especially well. A nice treat for the evening though."
"La Terrible poured almost black, with a perfect sized creamy head. It had sweet and hop smells. The taste was overall very good, it had alot of different flavors and spices, and you could make out the hops as well, but nothing was overpowering, it wasnt a light beer, but easy to drink. Overall great beer, very enjoyable."
"A little too dry and hard on the carbonation, I suspect that this beer might have passed its peak. Still a very drinkable and very Unubroue beer."
"Had this on-tap at Armsby Abbey into a Trois Pistoles goblet. Poured dark brown with a small off-white head that disappeared quickly, leaving only a thin ring and not much lacing. Picked up a mix of light and dark fruits in the scent, sort of faint but pleasant. Taste is off-putting and not expected at all. The main thing I taste is sour grapes. Some red wine and pear notes. I also get some quad-esque tastes such as chocolate and brown sugar, and that signature Unibroue yeast. I love sours but the tartness just didn't fit right. For this style I expect and prefer nice, rich beers. The mouthfeel was terrible, extremely watery. I've never tasted a 10% beer that was this thin before, booze was quite noticeable too. The tastes weren't ""terrible", it's the mouthfeel that really made this beer bad. Very disappointed with this one especially because Unibroue has only been great to me so far. Wouldn't get it again."
"F: Sweet but dries well, pretty hot and boozy on the finish though. A little tingly alcohol and warming boozy taste and feel. Lots of sticky sweetness and sweet stickiness. Lingering dark Belgian malts a little with more raisin, nuts, dried fruits, chewy malt flavors, and a hint of bitterness again."
"Pours a very dark brown. A big head that quickly leaves. Virtualy no head at all. Taste is quite sweet. This is a 2004 bottle. I feel like a fresher bottle would be better. The flatness is kinda off putting."
"I've never tried a beer this old and I've also never tried a beer that tasted so old! Makes sense I guess. Even under all the flaws the over-aging has produced, there are still many redeeming qualities here. This was a very complex beer and one I'm glad to have tried even though I didn't consider it to be terribly drinkable. (It might be worth mentioning that drinking this beer made my stomach feel like garbage for a solid couple days afterward.)"
"Just put this on about 5 days ago and it's already gone. Pours a pretty dark drown to black color. Kinda surprised but a fairly decent head and lacing. Smell is really faint but the coolest part about this particular beer is the mouthfeel and aftertaste. Light in carbonation and very smooth. This beer reminds me of Leffe Bruin due to the fact that it finishes like root beer. It has that odd Belgian-like clove finish that always reminds me of root beer. Gotta be the clove. I would never expect this beer to have such a high ABV. You could actually suggest to the seasoned beer veteran and the novice alike."
"good beer overall and i will get one again."
"La Terrible is a very dark beer, one of the darkest I've had I think. Almost no light is able to shine through the glass. The beer looks and smells great, but I was slightly disappointed with the overall taste. The beer almost smells a bit fruity, very sweet. The taste is a little stronger than I anticipated, and not at all sweet - Slightly bitter taste. You can definitely tell the 10.5% alcohol level. This isn't a bad beer, but I think I've had some other Belgian strong dark ales that I would choose over this."
"Overall I was impressed. This really a top notch and very well done example from Unibroue. I would have no trouble going this route again; in fact I cannot wait to."
"D - the over two years as mellowed the 10.5% abv. no problem downing the bottle myself"
"D: This would go great with a grilled steak or chunk of roast beef. It would make a great desert beer or complex enough to be drunk on its own."
"Gunshot pop when the cork was removed, terrible has a trois pistoles look but a few shades lighter. Light mahagony with brownish spots around the way. The head looks healthy and stealth with a certain creaminess to it and a tannish brown color. Smell is out of this world Belgian. I know Unibroue is Canada, but they always do it so well. A similiar yeast strain as Trois with some bread and sweetness. The dark fruit just shoots right up your nostrils. The taste is great and almost reaches as much vigor as the nose. Plums, a whole bunch of raisins, some chocolate that's more like a light cocco. At the end some residual sugar and a splash of alcohol. I think this bottle has some years on it, so hops really ain't in the picture. The feel is smooth and above medium with a light and subtle carb. The flavor just sort of coats the mouth and sticks around for a while. Well the verdict is out on terrible, and it's not terrible at all. I will snag up some more bottles for future enjoyment, this one really shined."
"D- canada really? Well done! For 10 abv this is some really easy drinking. Super flavorful but so but so acessble. I dug the shit out of it."
"They don't make many mistakes over at Unibroue. A text book example of a fantastic Belgian strong dark ale. Well, it's dark to start with. Milk chocolate, truffles, spicy yeast, fresh dough and a little bit of rum raisin, plums and cherry. Alcohol is noticeable but not overt. Sleek long finish. Perhaps not dissimilar enough from some of their other beers, but they're all so good, who gives a shit?"
"d: a decent beer; worth a try but to me not the best unibroue has to offer"
"(1.0) D - I hate to slam this beer as I'm normally a HUGE fan of anything Unibroue, but as I sip on this beer I'm considering pouring it out. The flatness makes it almost undrinkable. It MUST be a bad bottle?"
"Poured from a 750 ml caged and corked bottle into a long stem wine glass. Poured opaque amber color with about 2 inches of residual head. Heavily carbonated. Lots of bubbles. Huge flavors of dark fruits with a sweet crispness of green apples, red delicous apples and ripe golden pears. Smell definitely is sweet and fermented. Mouthfeel is bubbly, tingly and light. Alcohol well hidden. Very refreshing. But certainly a sipper."
"Overall: The mouth feel is carbonated, watery, and edgy. The body of the beer is medium and the finish is medium. I feel that this beer is incomplete and all over the taste buds. This beers need to be aged and maybe it will be wonderful."
"Great stuff and another high quality beer from Unibroue."
"D - Pretty drinkable, but definitely a sipping beer. The carbonation definitely slows you down."
"Dark body, black in colour, with a slight head making an appearance. Strong malt and caramel aromas, accompanied by some sweet alcohol aromas. Taste is sweet and sour. Some spicy hints with some hoppy bitterness. Floral as well. very complex. No alcohol aftertaste, which is good. WELL DONE!!!"
"From the 750 ml. bottle. Expiration date of 11-11-2013. Sampled on Feb. 28, 2010. This was a difficult cork to remove. I had to use a corkscrew, which I never have to do for beer corks. Luckily I did a good job popping it so none of the cork ended up in the beer. It pours brown with about two fingers of puffy beige head. The aroma is a tad alcoholic but not offensive in the very least. I note some light hops, malts, cereal, and bread. The mouthfeel is decent and rather bold. The taste is incredibly smooth with a bitterness that is typical of strong ales along with mild hops. All told this was an excellent brew."
"This is my second or third time having this beer, first time on draft, and every time I like it more and more. Thank you Unibroue and thank you Tap and Mallet, I'll be seeing you both later."
"Edit: Second tasting, 05/07/11--Head stuck better this time, aroma was floral with boozy raisin, flavor had a stronger molasses/brown sugar/honey sweetness with earthy green hops. Similar ratings."
"3.5/4/4.5/4/4"
"D: Liquid decadence in a bottle. Ass kicking in a bottle too. It goes down easy, and tastes so good, one might forget it kicks in at over 10% ABV. Folks who drink wine and also want to enjoy beer would like this one. It's beer's version of a fine wine, except it's better because it's beer and not wine, IMHO."
"Taste: Figs and sugar. A little bit of warming alcohol in the finish. Yeasty throughout."
"I have said before that a BSDA is a hard beer to master. Unibroue seems to be doing the best job of putting out great, quality BSDAs time after time."
"Unibroue is known for quality Belgian style brews and this one is no exception. Simply outstanding."
"This is one dark ale. It poured as black as a stout with a supprsingly phenomenal tan head. Smells like potpourri almost. Taste is spicy mixed with a bit of sweet malt. Has a really smooth finish.. This is a pleasent beer, and has a pretty nice taste. I find it pretty drinkable. It would go well with smoked salmon"
"*Influenced by fellow tasters and/or direct input"
"A keeper"
"If pairing with food, I would be selective... avoid spices (especially asian)... perhaps a hearty beef stew would be good, or any red meat with light fixin's."
"Drinkability: It's a hearty, but very drinkable beer. A perfect warmer for cool fall/winter days or nights. Might be a bit too strong and flavorful for sessioning, but a 750 ml bottle goes down very easily. Overall, another outstanding Unibroue beer."
"Overall this is a very good beer. I'd recommend it with some nice cheeses and some lighter foods to enhance the flavors. Some fruits might go quite well."
"M, D- There are many who report flat bottles, but not this example which was much too lively if anything. There is refinement and acceptable texture here, like a velvety sweetness. And there are no sharp edges or objectionable flaws. But unfortunately the malt structure is just missing-in-action. This bottle failed to inspire."
"D: Pretty good. I think it's a little pricey at $9 / 750mL, and it doesn't come in a 4 pack to get the discount or a more reasonable serving size. It's a little work to polish off a full bottle of this bad boy."
"M/D: The beer had a medium feel to it, a bit thicker than expected, but I think that this was offset by some of the carbonation. The beer was pretty easy to drink, although this is not among my favorite styles. Overall, probably one of the better Belgian Darks that I have tried."
"I'm pretty sure I remember from high school French that 'Terrible' doesn't mean the same as it does in English. I hope not, this is one of the best beers I've tried in a while. Cheers!"
"Drinkability: Not as great as I thought it would be, really. Sure, it's a solid brew, reasonably well made, but I think there was a lot lacking in this one, especially given that it's the most highly reviewed beer at what is widely considered to be a very good brewery. On tap it was not as reasonably priced as the 750s seem to be (Unibroue is always well priced here in Virginia), so perhaps it is a worthwhile beer for its pricepoint, but I wouldn't necessarily see myself going out of my way for this one again."
"D - This is a very good beer, always a chance with Unibrone to have a great beer, while not the top of the line for the style, but a damn fine beer nonetheless"
"Exceptionally satisfying brew - if not my absolute favorite from Unibroue, it is the one I return to most often. This ages with the best of them."
"Another great selection from Unibroue. Up there with Maudite and La Fin du Monde as one of their best. A joy to sample on tap."
"As a side note: Part of a 5-beer Christmas gift from the family. I can't thank them enough."
"D- This beer would be much more drinkable if it weren't for the astringency on the pallet and the harsh carbonation."
"All in all this is a very, very good beer. I'm not a big fan of this style and probably wouldn't get it again, but I'm glad I tried it and wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to anyone who appreciates the style."
"Rich sherry-like flavors: strong alcohol, sweet berry. Rich body with a warming swallow. If there are hops, they are hidden. I would consider this to be an after-dinner drink, IF you haven't had too much to drink already. This is a very tasty sipping beer."
"I think La Terrible could also go into the Quad category as well. That's the problem with Belgium's and their offspring; they don't fit into set categories.I would like to age a bottle for a year or so to see if it mellows out. Unibroue is an excellent brewery that has yet to make a product I don't like."
"Drinkability.... well Im about half way through with this 750ml and im feeling nice. Im sure by the end of this I wouldnt want another Terrible. But one bottle at a time seems perfect. Not something I would want to drink all the time (for me thats what high is)"
"Tastes: Malt sweetness and toffee-Carmel on the front, and some hop bitterness in the back. Does not take anything away from the beer overall, in fact adds some character and flavor that it needs. This beer has loads of flavor, and can stand up to any Belgium Dark Ale, despite the name. If you get a chance go and pick up one yourself, you be the judge."
"Poured into a tumbler it produces a 1 inch brownish white head that leaves moderate lacing. The appearance is opaque dark brown. The aroma is mainly of malts with no hop presence to speak of. The taste is strong malt and sweet with a strong flavor of cloves. (Mmmm! Cookies!) No detectable bitterness and good alcohol heat. The feel is full bodied with a clean finish. This ale left me buzzed and wanting more."
"D: Definitely to be sought out."
"D: A massive beer that doesn't taste massive? Yes please. Another outstanding offering from the folks at Unibroue."
"D- Very good, the alcohol is extremely well hidden. If I didn't have to drive I could have easily had a few more of these and been in a bit of trouble."
"D: Really...maybe I am partial to the style. I love a nice, robust flavorful brew (like food) and this fits the bill..."
"On tap at local pub. Dark pour with creamy head. Raisin and plum aroma, also some pear. Sweet and smooth. Medium body. Little carbonation. Truly a unique beer. Had I drank it blindfolded, I could have been convinced that this was wine. Very pleasant."
"Drinkability: I like the fact that this, to me, tastes like a highly carbonated, light-bodied barleywine. It is sophisticated yet approachable; a frankly difficult combination to achieve. Quite drinkable indeed."
"This is not my favorite by this brewer, but adheres to traditions of the style and was a pleasant surprise in terms of the nose and the back end of the flavor. Very much reminded me of a red wine. Incredible beer."
"I guess it's been awhile since my last Unibroue, but this one is definitely among their top offerings. I thought this was fantastic."
"Dark black color with ruby highlights and a large tan head with nice retention and lacing. Smells sweet with dark fruit, brown sugar, and yeast. The same is true of the taste. Very easy and smooth to drink. The perfect beer for the tulip glass I am using. A snifter would have been great too. Light to medium bodied, nice carbonation, and very drinkable for 10.5 % alcohol, which is well hidden."
"Just another one of Unibroue's amazing Belgian style ales."
"Drinkability: This is just incredible. By far the best Unibroue beer I've had, and the best belgian dark in a while. I will buy this again."
"I had to post a follow-up; it's been about 4 hours now since I drank this beer; I've had 3 beers since then and I keep tasting this beer on the tail-end of every sip I take. This is truly la terrible."
"Had this beer many times and it is slightly different every time. Roasty and the darkest of brown in body with big beige head. Light chocolate and Unibroue yeast in smell and taste. Chocolate, black malt, chocolate wafers and dark fruit. Mouthfeel could have gone a touch higher but could have been more sudsy for the style. Good but not special."
"Would drink again for sure."
"Great brew from Unibroue!"
"The pour has a solid layer of caramel colored foam, about a finger and half thick, that lasted for almost a minute. The head stayed around the edge of the glass constantly, slightly lacing it as I continued to drink. This beer is pitch dark, you can't see through it, the trite writer could say it's 'inky.' Smelling this you know you have a high abv (10.5) here, whew! You can freaking smell the alcohol. The taste is a balance of yeasts, fruits and some caramel. The taste is almost sweet, I really enjoy it and I could see myself sipping on this for a while. However, I really enjoy the taste so much and the mouthfeel that I find it hard to put down. There's a lot of carbonation in this beer and it's sort of foamy every time I drink it, it's a really interesting play that I quite enjoy. La Terrible is only nine dollars after tax, it's something I could see myself buying again in the future."
"M/D- A bit thin in the mouthfeel, but that adds to the drinkability. Overall this is a good sipper when the usual Unibroue isn't enough"
"Overall - A good beer with a better nose than taste. Recommended to try, but I find many Unibroue offerings to be better."
"This seems a bit light given its strength, but has a lot of flavor and the nose is quite nice. Another tasty brew from Unibroue."
"Very drinkable, although it does give you a bit of that ""late evening sipper"" feeling."
"While the body was full and smooth, I found it to be a little thin for the style. Drinkability was very good, smooth and easy to drink, although at 10% I'm not sure about drinking several in a row. Overall, a wonderful beer from an excellent brewery, worth trying and seeking out."
"Dark as night, ever-so slightly dark brown hues when held to the light, sticky head that holds for a while. A good sniff and I'm reminded of a dubbel, dark fruits.. sweet. Taste is similar.. puckering sweet, dark fruits, hops has a slight kick with a clove spice and banana in the mix, finishes syrupy sweet. Mouthfeel is heavy carbonated and a bit chewy. So... where does this one fall for me.. I heavily enjoy it, the alcohol slightly warms the throat but is well masked with the flavors. A decent complexity. May be a bit too sweet and syrupy for some.. but.. ya know.. drink it. One bottle should be a just the right amount. (I'm only half way through at the moment, so who knows..) Definitely would recommend this one. cheers no fears."
"also @ a reasonable price, you have my vote for the #1 belgian brewery outside of Belgium. Hats of to you Unibroue."
"Taste is not as pronounced as say, a Chimay Blue, but still as complex. The taste really starts off with tons of malty sweetness and wine grapes, then moves along to the dark fruit along with a slight caramel/brown sugar undertone and slight hop bitterness. Mouthfeel is smooth and medium-bodied with adaquate carbonation. The 10.5% ABV is not deterring at all, as it's very muted and hidden very well. Drinkability is moderately good. Unibroue's definitely got the BSDA style down - La Terrible is quite tasty."
"Poured a dark brown with a respectable head that faded to a thin skin. The aroma was over ripe fruit and alcohol. The taste was...grapes! At least that's what I got out of it. There was also a molasses sweetness and lots of carbonation, hey it's a Belgian. Mouth feel looked like it should have been medium, but was really light bodied with a strong carbonation. Drinkability was OK, the 750 ml was more than enough. Not my favorite from Unibroue (La Fin du Monde), and not my favorite BSDA (The Beast), but a good one."
"D- Very nice replica of a traditional Belgian brew. This one showed signs of being mistaken as a Quad."
"Unibroue wins again."
"D- too much umph with the higher abv to have more than just the one evening quench. But regardless of that abv still good enough taste to enjoy."
"D: Very drinkable for an ABV of 10.5%. Definitely one to use to introduce others to dark Belgian brews."
"Cheers!"
"Pours an opaque sable, nearly black, with a thick and fine-bubbled beige head. Aroma is malty with a nutty undertone and quite tempting. Flavor is malty, a little nutty and slightly sweet with a hint of caramel. Smooth, tingly texture leaves a nutty and malty finish."
"Drinkability- this beer is certainly easy to drink and it definitely does grow on you as you go,alcohol feels warm at points but not terribly off balance considering such a big menacing 10.5 percent, its seemed not letting this beer be to cold was a must as tempature dropped the complexity grew directly inversly, a very nice example of a belgian strong dark ale even if there are some better out there, certainly worthy of a try,"
"D - This is quite fruity for a strong, dark belgian, but it comes together well and displays a nice level of complexity. The dark fruit is very nice, though the malt complexity is less impressive. Well worth trying and even deserving of a regular place in the beer fridge."
"Very nice sweet sugar caramel. Very well carbonated which gives the beer a rather light feel. Some nice vanilla, great sweet banana. Brown sugar. Really sweet. Light chocolate tastes. A good beer that I would like to try again sometime."
"My first impression was that it tasted like dates with a slight alcohol taste. There is lots of body in this beer, which I like. A slight sweetness lingered. I thought there would be a thicker texture based on the look but it is more drinkable."
"Drinkability: I would definitely have this again and boy was it worth the trip. The first time I had this is the bottle and now having it on-tap make this brew so much more enjoyable."
"This is a tasty brew and one that has helped to pique my interest in the style a bit."
"D: Split the bottle but I could have drank it myself. Fresh it is ok but with 3? years on it this was a real winner."
"MF&D - the feel is just a bit thick for me, I think I would rate it at a medium-thick, not quite as syrupy and viscous as an old ale or a ris, but definitely getting there. the carbonation is also a bit too much, needs to tone it down. the drinkability is fine, but I just thought this beer was a 'meh'; though it was undoubtedly good, it wasn't special enough for me to want more."
"D- as heavy as this beer is it goes down like a pale ale. shoots right down to the stomach leaving a nice warm feeling. One of my favs from unibroue."
"A wonderfully balanced big boy beer, the effect worthy of its moniker."
"(D)- One of my favorite Belgian Strong Darks out there. Great complexity and balance amidst delicate and layered components. You still taste it minutes after each sip. The 10.5% abv is integrated very well; until you feel it at the end! The whole 750mL will be enjoyed slowly to savor each sip."
"D: Very drinkable, especially for the ABV. Another very solid beer from Unibroue. They seem to kick out a ton of similar beers and yet they are all distinctly different and good in their own way."
"So I don't think I hyped this up for myself. I was hyped up for Duchesse de Bourgogne last night and was severely disappointed. I want a case of this."
"D=drinkable, enjoyable, however the alcohol content hinders this a little."
"A good solid beer from Unibroue, though I can't say it's one of their very best."
"drinkability: Alcohol is really hidden! Glad I read the label and took it slow."
"Drinkability: Paired remarkably well with the movie ""Casino"". I'd pair the last third with some food to see how it goes, but I only have yogurt and ramen, so... Easily one of the better Unibroue brews I've had, but, sadly, not one I often see around in Georgia. Ah well, such is life. Drinks surprisingly easy for purportedly being above 10%."
"D: Easily my favorite Unibroue beer -- it contains a huge flavor with a great feel. A couple of years on this will be great to bring out more malt subtleties. A superb beer by any standard."
"Overall: Though not my favorite from Unibroue, a solid offering and well worth a taste."
"Not the best I've had from Unibroue by far, but clearly satisfying."
"D - Big beers are never as drinkable to me. I tend to like them more but drink them less. At 10+% and a very tongue engrossing flavor this is a nice bottle to share once in a while, not an everyday kind of thing."
"D- Pretty straightforward in its malty sweetness. The dark fruit taste/aroma bring some complexity but it's just a little to simple for what I was expecting."
"T: Mmmm...mild coffee up front under dominating carbonation that turns prickly halfway through until it dissolves into a powerful, thick, sticky, slightly bitter molasses/coffee flavor. Finishes like a stout - with a similar complex bitterness."
"Different but nice."
"While the high abv is nicely masked, the carbonation really kills the enjoyment level of this one for me."
"D: Danger! The alcohol hides terribly well. The wheat makes this beer more refreshing than it should be with this high an ABV. I recommend splitting this one with a friend."
"Drinkability: This one doesn't show its strength."
"M - Nicely carbonated, medium to thin bodied."
"A good Belgian style dark ale, a bit creamy feel, which is unexpected. I think one bottle at a time is a good idea"
"D- The rich flavor and higher ABV make this a nice sipper. While I can't see having more than a snifter or two in a sitting, it's quite drinkable for the the style and I'd buy it again for a special occasion."
"The high ABV limits the drinkability but the taste keeps you coming back for more. Unibroue has another winner."
"D - Because of the alcohol content of this beer, it is NOT a session beer."
"D- This is a very unique and complex beer. Because of the high abv and in your face flavor profile I would definitely stop at one of these but they come in a 750 so...."
"A 750ml corked and caged bottle split with brothercannon. Poured into twin snifters, and after stirring up the yummies in the bottle, the ale appears a cloudy dark chestnut color with about an inch of off white foam. Aromas and taste consist of dark fruits such as figs, prunes, raisins, sweet, bready grain, quite fruity, and somewhat spicy. Approaching full bodied for the style and certainly adequately carbonated. Crisp and bubbly. Really nice all around."
"Nice head, dark clear color. The smell is overwhelmingly yeast. The most yeast/bread smelling beer I have ever experienced. I'm wondering how this will effect the taste. As the head recedes, the smell gets a bit fruity. The taste is excellent. The yeast scent has mellowed and now the taste is much more fruit flavored, like grapes, apples, cherries, currants. Overall, a great blend of very complex flavors. The best beer I've had by Unibroue by far. I've always wanted to like this brewery and this beer has made me a believer. The tasted linger for a while in a good refreshing and fruit flavored manner. Really drinkable. Not much alcohol flavor at all. It's starting to scare me. Get this and savor it. You won't regret it."
"This is a very drinkable Belgian dark strong. The dry finish only makes it more drinkable."
"Served in my Uprising Chalice. Directly out of the tap, it was a very color, a combination of browns and reds with lots of head. This is a very clean tasting beer. There isn't much carbonation, but I don't mind that. There aroma isn't very distinct, but there is a hint of raisins or other dried fruit. I can detect molasses and vanilla in the taste. Also, there is a smoothness reminiscent of good bourbon (with the burn that is often associated with this trait). There is also a sweetness at the end that is very welcome. Overall, I pretty good beer; not Unibroue's best, but worth picking up a bottle (or ordering a pint) if you get a chance."
"M-D- Mouthfeel is very dry upfront and finishes with hard alcohol feel on the tongue. Smooth to the finish for me and drinkablity is excellent.. will try again if found."
"Poured a nice deep brownish black into my snifter with a nice little tan head that sticks around and keeps a thin layer on the top and edges. I'm getting whiffs of fig, malt, dark fruits and candied sugars. The taste is right on target with what I'm smelling and has a nice dry finish. Very complex flavors with a smooth buttery mouthfeel as it warms. This is a fantastic beer and I am very glad I picked it up. I'm not sure what year I am drinking because the only date on it states that it is good until 2/26/2012. This beer tastes great now and I would imagine having a few years on it would make it even better. At 10.5% it is definitely a sipper however the alcohol is in no way evident in the taste (I can feel it though). Fantastic beer. I'll definitely pick it up again if I see it."
"drinkability: overall a solid beer probably rated higher because I loved the style but not my favorite by far."
"On-tap at Raleigh Flying Saucer while waiting for the World Beer Fest Brewers party to begin. Served in a tulip glass an almost opaque black with ruby highlights and a nice khaki diminishing head. Aroma was sweet fruits, dark malts and a hint of spice. The taste was a nice blend of sweet fruits and spice. The most interesting thing about this beer was that it did not taste like a dark beer at all. The beer was medium bodied with VERY well hidden alcohol and a refreshing smoothness. This one is quite enjoyable, but certainly one to be careful with."
"D- easy drinkin id say."
"Overall the amount of fruits and thinner than normal mouthfeel make this drink like a strong dubbel more than anything. Regardless, it's a tasty brew that's worth a shot."
"D- Nothing amazing, but pretty good. I'm sure I'll move through this one."
"D - Deceptive color, awesome smell, fantastic flavors, incredibly drinkable!"
"Notes: Right on target for the style, Unibroue flexes its proverbial muscle and hits a home run with this one."
"Very creamy mouthfeel. High carbonation, although appropriate. Cork came out with a huge POP! Satisfying finish. Pretty easy drinker. Yet another quality offering from Unibroue. Chambly Noire has kept Unibroue from being my #1 overall brewery. La Terrible is anything but."
"Very smooth. The malty flavor stays for a bit, it's nice."
"d - a solid sipper and a nice bomber for the evening. Barely lets on that it is a sturdy 10.5% ABV. If you like the main Unibroue lineup then you'll like this one. I do on both counts."
"Notes: This reminds me more of a Belgian Stout than some beers that openly claim to be a Belgian Stout! Roasted maltiness, sweet fruitiness, nice and spicy with a great mouthfeel. What else do you want? Another great brew from Unibroue!"
"One. Its like a desert on its own and I can feel it still tingling in the stomach. It's good but heavy."
"D: The mouthfeel helps this beer a lot, but the smells are almost non-existant, the taste isn't balanced in my opinion, but I did enjoy drinking the entire bomber. Refreshing!"
"Good beer but its lacking more malts and should I say a little watery for this style. Needs more flavor to come through."
"Couldn't down this, but it's pleasant and quite impressive, for a while. It's not very drinkable, but it's nice."
"Dark colored beer with a slow fading head.Aroma is dark fruits and spices.Taste is prunes,raisins and assorted other dark fruits.There is a bit of alcoholic kick on the finish.This is not a beer that will blow you away but it's still a good solid beer.I would recommend!!"
"this was a christmas present and was a real taste treat."
"slightly on the heavy side, but overall a good drinking experience. Alcohol hits hard and I was feeling it after only a half of a 750mL bottle. I would like to age one of these a year or two and see if the alcohol mellows out a bit and the character develops more."
"Really enjoyed this rare beer and recommend it to any belgian fan. Go unibroue, you did it right with this one!"
"D- another masterpiece that garners my continued respect for unibroue, who do it as good (and often times better) than the belgians. sophisticated and utterly tasty, this one will stick in my memory among the world's finest."
"ok drinkability but one is plenty"
"750ml corked and caged bottle. Poured the color of cola; translucent with ruby-red highlights. Off-white head quickly dissipates - no lacing on this one. Nose is dark fruit and candi sugar. Taste follows nose, but also picked up some yeast. Mouthfeel falls between light- and medium-bodied and very effervescent. This is a decent belgian strong dark, but there are better examples out there in my opinion."
"Overall, very well balanced. It wasn't too sweet or too chocolatey. Instead of concentrating on one flavor, this beer is a medley of deliciousness. The alcohol has been tamed and put to good use as it plays in with the overall character of this beer. Unibroue KICKS ASS at making awesome beer."
"What a fabulous brew; a rich and full number, with a huge deal of complexity, and a superbly hidden alcohol content. It's extremely drinkable for something I know is so heavy."
"Tastes of more dark fruits, with a definitive vinous essence working itself throughout the palate. Alcohol and spice weigh in toward the end, and it finishes fairly dry, while leaning toward the heavy end of the mouth-feel spectrum. This is another way above par outing from Unibroue."
"D--Again, a heavyweight in ABV and appearance, but going down nicely. You wouldn't drink a bottle of wine this fast, so cuidado!"
"Unibroue never disappoints, I can only hope to one day visit the brewery were these works of art come from."
"Pours with a large tight foamy head. Clear raisin brown color with garnet highlights. Aroma is quite strong and sweet, can smell rum, yeast, figs and grape jelly from across the room. Starts sweet and cocoa, lots of rum, alcohol definitely noticeable. Lots of dried fruits, raisins, dates, in the middle. Aftertaste is lingering alcohol that warms up the throat. Body seems somewhat lighter than expected."
"Cracked this one open after moving a bunch of heavy furniture for the girlfriend, smashing fingers, injuring forearms, etc. It was a welcome break. Appearance was a beautiful dark brown like teak wood, with a mahogany tinge. Smell was average, nothing too sweet or noteworthy. Taste and mouthfeel were awesome due to an abundance of carbonation: Gives you the taste of a fine dark ale but with with a beautiful bubbly counterpoint. Drinkability is down a bit just because I can't move any more furniture for the girl once I'm done here and she's giving me dirty looks. All in all, pretty damn good."
"D: Deceptively so."
"D- La Terrible is a solid beer that was very enjoyable, but it is definitely a sipper. Recommended."
"no sign of the of the alcohol! incredibly easy to finish the bottle! 8/4.5/8/3.5/17/4.1"
"This is an excellent drinker, great flavor, smooth, great hidden alcohol, always leaving you craving another sample."
"Pours very dark, almost opaque with some faint ruby highlights. Do not recall any other Belgian Dark Ale this black in color. Fizzy, big-bubbled head thinned out to a nice durable whispy cover. Somewhat restrained, but pleasant aromas of dark fruits, cherrys and yeast. Even with the typical lively carbonation for this style, the beer presents a full body and chewy mouthfeel. Rich sweet flavors of dark figs, raisins, cherries, dark rum and yeast make a presence. The 10.5% is well balanced and unobtrusive but quite warming and stealth. Finishes sweet and slick, but in no way cloying. I've read previous reviews where this release from Unibroue is somewhat hit or miss, but I think I got a nice hit with this one."
"D - great drinkablity, the sweetness isn't overwhelming, and the alcohol isn't evident in the taste"
"D: Incredible drinkability, abv is well hidden and comes highly recommended."
"(rated Aug 21, 2008)"
"Very nice. Right off, the 10.5% is completely masked by the smooth, sweet taste of this beer. Murky brown pour with a squatty off-white head. Fruity aroma similar to a lighter cognac. Dark fruits, malt, and sugar mix well with the malt. Palate was enjoyably light for a change. Its nice not to have every Belgian Strong be thick and syrupy. Overall, a great beer."
"Pours a decent-sized head, tan-brown in color, and diminishing. Pours a black colored bodyr. Has a mild aroma, some sweetness, and slight perfume, some coffee. A taste of sweet thick molasses, very fizzy, alcohol."
"The beer was drinkable, but grew a bit weary over time. It had hints of something great at times, but the price factor overwhelms the enjoyability of this beer, which is unfortunate."
"This poured an opaque dark ruby with tan head. It smelled like wild yeast with caramel, molasses, licorice, and nutty malts, with orange hops and a bit of lemon and alcohol. It tasted like lots of wild yeast and soy and vinegar, with licorice and some molasses and oak, and a bit of alcohol. The taste becomes dominated by very smooth and creamy yeast and sweet caramel as it warms. It was fairly thick with some carbonation, and a lasting bitter aftertaste. Overall this had nice flavor, but was too dominated by the Belgian yeast. It had good body, was very clean, and wasn't difficult to drink. The alcohol is noticeable but not strong. A pretty good beer cold, but delightful warm. Potential for improvement with age is there too."
"750 mL bottle. Dark brown pour with light tan head, larger than normal head. Great natural carbonation. Aroma of caramel and coffee with some faint fruit. Taste of brown sugar, malt and Belgian yeast. Extremely smooth for something with almost 11% alcohol. Fantastic finish."
"Another good beer from one of my favourite canadian brewers. This beer was great fresh but even better with some age on it. Recommended!"
"A suprise find here in the desert. Pours dark as can be, looks deep, deep brown with some light around the edges. Huge, rocky, off-white head that takes 10 minutes to settle with good lacing and retention (in a Duvel glass). Smell was a little disappointing, it was very strong of yeast and bread. Not bad, but I guess I was expecting a little more and although some fruit and caramel was present, I couldnt get past the yeast. Taste was wonderful and complex. It was definitely darker than many of their other offering with a more caramelized and almost chocolatey edge to it. A mix of dark fruits, some cherry I swear I tasted the first few sips, sweet malt, toasted grains, yeast and bread. Mouthfeel was thicker than other Unibroue offerings it seemed like but made it perfect for sipping. A very good beer. As others have noted, the alcohol is very well hidden so sip this slowly and enjoy the changes the beer undergoes as the temperature changes."
"This beer was just as good as I hoped it would be, and it would be nice to see the brewery produce this again. I'd be happy to throw a couple of these into storage and see how they develop. Huge thanks to Derek for sharing this one!"
"M + D: A nice sipper, up there among the best of the Unibroue offerings. A nice little effervescence on the palate with a touch of warmth on the finish. Very good."
"This beer pours a deep dark brown with a big cap of tan foam. It almost looks like root beer in the tulip glass. Aroma is sweet fruit with good dose of spiciness, particularly clove. Light to medium bodied on the palate. The flavor is a good mesh of dark sweet fruit, earthy spice, and malt. There is something a little off toward the end, perhaps metallic. Overall pretty good, but the flavor doesn't live up to the expectation that the aroma and appearance set."
"D: Minus the ofsetting metallic taste this one would be really good, and easy to drink, but the aluminum taste really detracts on this one for me. Maybe another try at some point in time and a new year?"
"Drinkability: 10.5% but still, I'll take it over some cheapie skunk beer any day on the drinkability scale."
"I served this one on the cold side for the first glass but I'll take the bottle out of the fridge so my second glass hopefully reveals more subtle flavors. As it is, though, a very good Belgian beer. And it's from Canada, eh?!"
"Drinkability - Not something I would continue to pursue on a regular basis, but worth it for the alcohol content per deliciousness ratio. Good name appeal leaves it as a nice entry to strong dark belgians."
"Drinkability: The high alcohol content is disguised very well. I found this very drinkable for such a malty, high alcohol beer."
"D- Drinks slowly, not exactly what i would say smooth, but as i said before, this is a characteristic that i would cash in for the mouthfeel"
"I love unibroue. Another fine beer from them, though a bit more expensive."
"Overall: does the trick"
"Had the pleasure of sampling this one on tap at the Burlington Brewfest. Off their tap my glass was filled with a deep, dark, nearly opaque brown. The head was brown sugar colored, laced gorgeously and retained throughout the sampling. The aromas were very rich and sweet, raisins and figs, caramel, cloves and other spices. The flavors were equally developed and bold, molasses and chocolate syrup, figs, dates and raisins, spices and yeast all built on a caramel malt backbone. Very complex and more layers present themselves as it warmed up. The mouthfeel was rich and smooth, with a medium to thick body. This was a big beer and though it would be overwhelming if you tried to session it I would definitely recommend enjoying a pint or splitting a bottle if you can find it."
"D - easy going down and pretty enjoyable"
"Poured this beer into a goblet from the 750ml bottle. Pours a dark brown that is almost black with a nice head that leaves nice lacing on the glass. The smell is raisins dark fruit and spices. The sweetness of this beer is upfront and tastes of dark fruits and raisins. The mouthfeel is thick with nice carbonation, the alcohol is right there. The drinkability is high, I split this one this time but could easily see myself enjoying a bottle myself over the course of a night. Overall im really glad I tried this and may stick one of these in the cellar."
"I love Unibroue"
"A drinkable beer. I'm not sure I would get it again, but it certainly wasn't bad. It just seemed the taste was a little one-sided."
"D = Good drinkability but in a category with some very fine competition I think is simply a solid ""good", but no better."
"D: Other than the finish, very consistent with St Bernardus or Rochefort. Overall, falls a bit short. Pretty sure I'll try this one again though."
"A big, boozy, tasty treat. Rich, complex and interesting with sweet sugar, massive boozy dark fruit and chocolate competing with the generous bitter woody tannins that you would expect from a good red wine. Alcohol presence throughout does add a certain heat."
"Easily one of my favorites in this style, Terrible is anything but, a great beer that is one of my favorite from a brewery that continually produces great beer. Terrible is outstanding."
"Pretty good Belgian style dark ale. I think this is the first Unibroue I've had. Good stuff."
"taste is strong, pepper, spice, sour malt, dark pitted fruits, touch of dark chocolate, ends slightly bitter and dry."
"Any loss in drinkability that comes with the ABV is offset by the value of the bottle. An affordable thing of beauty. Sip it but sip it often."
"D= My first sip of this beer made me think it would be a bit too sweet. As it warmed, that thought faded and I really began to dig the complexity of this ale. Definitely a sipper, but a damn fine one. Another great beer by Unibroue!"
"This is a great beer to get cozy with anytime of the year. The pour is an immense dark ruby red with a thin head and little lacing. Due to the high alcohol content this is to be expected. The aroma is unlike any other, awesome is an understatement. I drank from a red wine glass and an intense aroma of dark sweet fruits filled the air. I inhale and its as if I am drinking port, It is hard to explain how delicious the scent truly is. The beer is slightly thin on the palate but it works. The flavor is bursting with fruit flavors and sweet malts. Plums, cherries, figs, raisins, who knows what is all involved in this wonderful beer. Overall this is a must try. Not your typical brew, but exactly what I would expect from Unibroue. Absolutely Fabulous."
"D: Tasty but I really had to take my time with this."
"d- Too strong for a young weakling like myself, but great to try and I will introduce my hardier friends to it for sure."
"The beer is really fine, and is another Unibroue offering that makes me really respect the talents of the brewer. Outstanding, even amongst the other excellent beers they offer."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable. Alcohol is barely noticeable. I like it."
"Quite heavy mouthfeel, with quite a good bit of carbonation, which is normal for Unibroue it seems. For 10.5% this is freakishly easy going down."
"Drinkability: This is one of those beers that only limits you with it's high ABV. Delicious complex flavor and not too heavy, this is one of the best Dark Ale's I have had. Another winner from Unibroue, highly recommended."
"Big and bold, but not brash. Tons of flavor here, and maybe not even the most complex ale, as the flavors are all right there for the enjoyment. Quite a concoction, certainly one of Unibroue's more impressive achievements."
"Not my favorite Unibroue beer, but I would definitely recommend this to anybody looking for some Belgian Strong Dark Ale's."
"Another fine issue from Unibroue. Comes in a black 500 ml bottle with nothing but ""Terrible"" in silver lettering on it. Impressive looking, but a fitting container for this fine dark ale. Pours a dark brown; not black, it's not a Russian stout, but a nice dark amber. Excellent lasting foam, good carbonation. Taste is exactly what you want in a brown; good malt, rasted nut, very slight sweetness, no syrupy aftertaste, and no alcohol burn. Unibroue knows what they're doing."
"Overall this was a very good beer, one I'd happily get again. This falls under my term reward beer, not one for everyday drinking, but a nice treat to either celebrate something or to reward yourself. Great beer for sitting back and just enjoy the taste of it."
"Did a double Unibroue evening with the family, trying this and the 16 back to back. This one pours a dark brown color wiht a fine off-white head and pretty weak lacing. Nose is lots of dried fruit and roasted malt. Flavor is delicious: light molasses, coffee, chocolate. Lots of spiciness as well, masking most of the alcohol (although it does come through a little), and tons of swirling dried fruit. Carbonation is quite high, and the body was medium in feel. Overall, quite a tasty beer, sort of a souped up Leffe Brown, to me. Not quite as good as the 16, in our opinions."
"D- Not one of Unibroues best due to the carbonation. Probably would not be something I would seek out again."
"750ml corked n caged bottle. Pours black, light foam and little lacing. Smell is is sweet, dark fruits, ripened fruits, and strong alcohol character. Taste is strong. Alcohol is very present, and not hidden at all. It is what it is, and I like that. Huge roasted malt flavor, bitter chocolate, slight hop background, and big alcohol warming as it goes down. This is a big boy. Carbonation is average and is very full bodied. Handle with care."
"Drinkability- A truly magnificent brew, wonderful representation of the style."
"D - Good beer. Not as good as the other beers from Unibrou."
"Alcohol is perfectly masked. Mouthfeel is amazing. What looks to be a super-thick rich, heavy brew is in fact a tart, astringent, delicious, highly drinkable congac-like brew. The more I drink, the more I want. This is a ""Terribly"" delicious beer-sorry had to make the joke. Merci Unibroue!"
"D. This wasn't a bad brew, but neither one of Unibroue's best. Still a fair value for the price, and worth a shot if you like their other offerings."
"d - I appreciate it, but there is a little too much yeast presence and the alcohol content keeps it from being too drinkable. If I want this much yeast/sour character I would rather have a triple where the fruits and citrus are more present."
"Pours black with a thick tan looking head. Smells of alcohol, like a glass of wine. Very malty with a hint of fruit and spice. Taste is incredible. Has a smooth fruity taste to start and then a real alcohol kick. Has an oily and fizzy finish. Overall drinkability is great if you can handle the 10.5 ABV kick. Unibroue scores again."
"Drinkability- Very smooth drinking but it is quite obvious that the beer is 10.5% ABV. I enjoy it quite a bit but it would be difficult to stomach two in a day. I would however love to make a beer batter had I had any more left."
"Overall: A very unique, highly complex Belgian Strong Ale. One of the best I've had of all the Belgian styles."
"this is a good solid beer, not too fancy but still complex enough. very good"
"M/D: Full bodied, just the right amount of carbonation on the tongue. A sipper but fully drinkable for such a big beer. Great beer."
"Drinkability: This is the first Belgian strong ale I can ever remember trying and I would definitely seek this out again."
"Drinkability is moderate. Good flavors make it easy to drink, but at 10.5% ABV consumption should be on the slow side."
"Litterlly four fingers of a rocky rich tan foam quickly jumps to the top of the glass. Head has decent retention. Body is a blackish brown showing hints of ruby when held to light. Super full spicey notes jump to the nose with hints of taffy, carmalized malt, fresh cookie and dark fruit tones. A mingling of sour fruits and dark rich malty notes meld together on the tongue on first sip. The depth of the palate has creamy vanilla presences and a consistant, warm, spicey feel. The spices have a phelonic feel as they carry notes of sweet bread, cinnamon, and bananas. Mouthfeel is very thick and rich with the spicey feel really creating a malty feel in the mouth. This is a sipper at 10.5% alchol, but it is hidden very well. This makes a nicely drinkable winter brew."
"I ended up with this beer because I had a tasting and ended up having way to much beer. Since I spent the most money, I got to keep all the extra beer. Poured this bottle into my trusty Chimay chalice. Wow, it looks like Coca Cola when poured. Translucent brown with a huge rocky white head. Leaves no lacing whatsoever. Aroma is interesting. Definite notes of raisins, plums and other dark fruits. When cold, this beer has a hint of butter but if you let that puppy warm a bit the diacetyl really comes out. Taste is what I think an unsweetened raisin would taste like. Slight hints of other spices, but I cant put my finger on the flavors. Mouthfeel is highly carbonated, almost like a soda. I'm glad I was able to try this beer, but at the same time I'm glad I didn't have to drop the 8 bucks on the bottle either."
"D - This is another outstanding beer from Unibroue. It holds up well to all of their other beers and other beers of this style. Probably their best beer that i have had."
"D - This is another outstanding beer from Unibroue. It holds up well to all of their other beers and other beers of this style."
"D: What a treat...a great BSDA from a great Brewery. I could drink this brew from November to April...night after night."
"Recommended..."
"This is a very drinkable Belgian strong dark ale from Unibroue. Good balance, flavorful, and a nice boozy warmth."
"Very nice. Aroma is white wine, raisin, date, coriander, miscellaneous spices along with pepper, pine hops and cookie malts. Appearence is dark monotone brown with a frothy brown head. Flavor is spicey and it goes down creamy smooth with a warming finish."
"D- Very tasty and enjoyable. Perfect balance of complexity, richness, and drinkability. The alcohol was not noticeable at all."
"D- decent"
"Drinkability is low for a quad, this is just too sugary and ultimately falls short. Not quite terrible, but not too good either."
"Out of a 750ml corked and caged bottle. Pour a near black color with an average tan head that quickly dissipates into a ring around the glass. Not much in terms of lacing. The smell is average for a BSDA, some dark fruit esters are noticable with a very light candi sugar and barn yard aromas. Wine like fruity characteristics are fore front, with some raisin and plum like notes as well. Noticable sweetness from the candi sugar and a slight roasted malt, spice (corriander) and/or hop bitterness to try to balance the brew. The feel is light to moderate and quite fizzy, finishes on the sweet side but no where near cloying. The 10.5%ABV is totally well hiden, which makes this brew quite drinkable. Not the most impressive of BSDAs as the fruity esters don't seem up to par. I find Unibroue to be solid beers but nothing too fantastic."
"This is a relatively drinkable beer for the style, and obviously a high quality beer overall."
"Drinkability- A pleasure to drink but slowly so it can be savored."
"This took first place for the Unibroue beers I've tried as soon about two seconds after it hit my tongue. Full flavored but not obnoxious, boozy but dangerously smooth, agrees very well with all of my beer drinking senses. Highly recommended!"
"Poured an amber red with a nice creamy head, which after a moment subsided but remained stciky on the glass. Smells heavenly of fruits and wine. The taste was equally as good, with a wonderful dark fruit, almost plum and raisin-like smell. Mouthfeel was excellent, and man, this is fo good I could drink it all day. Just a fabulous beer, no question one of the top few that I've had. Spectacular!"
"pours a dark ruby red, almost purpleish color with hardly any head. smells like a wine, or maybe grape juice. tastes damn good, lots of flavor, strong alcohol flavor,with an overload of yeast, i can't finger what i like about this beer, just everything about it is yummy."
"Carbonation is a little more than I figured but works in the beer's favor."
"An opaque black beer with a two finger head in a wide mouth goblet that fizzles down to a nice laceing. Aroma was strongly phenolic, which at first turned me off, with a sweet malty finish. The taste was seriously phenolic, but not spicy like I would normally associate with these alcohols, instead it was almost sourish with the ethanol being defined but palletable. The phenolic flavor is balanced by a spectacular creamy smooth malty finish reminiscent of a bock or schwarzbier, not that this beer is anything like them. The mouth feel is medium in body with a relatively sharp carbonation. Goes down easily for a 10.5% abv beer. Good beer."
"750 ml bottle. Pours a ruby that is almost too dark to see through, small tan head. Aroma of bread and maybe wine. Initial taste is sour fruit and bread yeast. Finishes with hops and is less sour, alcohol can be noted. Light to medium body, light carbonation, some lacing. Drinkable, but would try more before I buy it again."
"Pours thick and consistent. There is a big head and dark fig like aroma here. First taste is that of prunes slathered in malt. The texture is chewy and fully coats my tongue. Long finish that is complex with fig, dark cherry, yeast and bread. At this hi alcohol content, it's going to take me awhile to finish this puppy."
"Flavor starts sharp and acidic. Sour fruits, hints of coffee. Alcohol is a bit noticeable in the flavor and rises up into the nose. Very winey."
"D - A well balanced beer. The spiciness and fruits are in excellent accord. A goo capper, but not a session by any means."
"Another good tasting brew from Unibroue. A couple qualms, however. It's heavier, but doesn't taste much different from the Maudite, like an Imperial Maudite. I would have prefered something a little different since its a special release. Also its very sweet, almost too sweet. I'm only half way through the bottle as I write this and I'm close to being sick of the massive amounts of sugars released in this beer. If the malts would have been more prominent to balance out the sweet with some carbohydrate flavor I think I would have enjoyed this better. Still, better than many."
"This is another solid beer from Unibroue. I can always count on them to produce great Belgian-style beers at a reasonable price. This one went quite well with some smoked cheddar and I imagine it would be a fine complement to a hearty meal in lieu of wine. Recommended."
"Smooth, medium bodied brew that drinks like a dream."
"Of course this beer is very expensive. 8 to 9 bucks a pop for a 3/4 liter corked bottle."
"Does anyone know if Tom Waits is touring?"
"This offering from Unibroue certainly delivered, and there's only half a bottle to go..."
"Overall, the best Unibroue I've had, hands down. Big flavors with exquisite subtleness. Highly recommended."
"Pours with no head and dark chocolate color. Very good arouma of chocolate and burnt malt. Some hints of sweatness to as well. I was very intrigued by the smell. Taste was of burnt chocolate, sweat and bitter at the same time, good woody taste as well. Very balanced between the sweet anf bitter. Mouthfeel was very nice. Coated the tounge letting the flavors soak in without a noticable after taste. The alcohol is hidden in this, but it will hit you. Nicely done, It's hard to walk by this one and not pick up another bottle."
"750ml from Ron's. Pours dark brown/black with just the slightest ruby-red highlights and about an inch of offwhite head that dissipates rather surprisingly quickly. Smells woody initially, with raisins, chocolate, nut, banana, and burnt qualities all playing equally big roles, with just a hint of pith. Tastes roasty, burnt, and raisony, with a good doses of chocolate, nut, banana, and citrus/pith playing huge roles too, with wood, nuts, and raisins playing bigger roles toward the finish and aftertaste Wow, this tastes great. Full rich velvety mouth-feel that makes this a relatively easy drinker for what a big beer it is. Alcohol is oddly absent from the aroma, flavor, and mouth-feel, so its effects sneak up on you with this beer. Wow. This beer is amazing - leaps and bounds better than I remember it being. Another slam-dunk for Unibroue!"
"Shared this corked bottled with a buddy of mine. Pours a dark almost ""porter"" color. Ginormous tan head, excellent head retention.Smell is faint bread & yeast, with a heavy malt presence. Taste is dried fruity sweet, hints of coffee, maybe oak? hmm... Mouthfeel is very smooth and creamy. Drinkability is quite good, but with such a strong brew, it's best shared with pals."
"Another impressive Unibroue work, and perhaps their best of the ""regulars""."
"Pours dark not to much of a head. It has a plum smell with a fruit scent to it. The taste is smooth but has a small bite at the end. I really enjoyed this one the abv is pretty high so I wouldnt be able to drink these all night long. If you can find them enjoy."
"D: Easier to drink than many Belgian Dark Ale's, and this one's strong! Serious trouble."
"Nice big beer that I really enjoy. I bought a case of the first vintage (2001?) and it's aging nicely. The CO2 is either mellowing out or it wasn't as high in the earlier versions. Plus the alcohol has blended into the overall flavor more. This one I just reviewed is new (bottled in 2007). Usually a price/quality/strength bargain at $9 or so but a store near me was blowing it out at $6.99 so I picked up several."
"--"
"Pours a very deep, dark brown with a nice, creamy head with good retention and lacing (poured from a 750 ml bottle into a snifter). You can definitely smell the alcohol at first. Then, you catch aromas of dark fruits and chocolate. Malty, both in the aroma and taste. This beer has a very sweet, almost fruity, chocolate taste to it. Very alcoholic. Feels fairly heavy in the mouth, with a fair amount of carbonation. Full bodied. Sip it! Overall, a pretty damn good beer, definitely worth checking out."
"When poured from the bottle if you look at the beer leaving the bottle it is almost a yellowish brown, but in the glass it is a nice dark brown almost opaque, with hints of red/orange when held to the light. The head was 3-4 fingers that lasted a minute or two then lace. The aroma was suprisingly not of alcohol at 10%+ but of malt and spice. The taste was initially of malt and fruit with a strong overbearing yeast flavor, not much alcohol taste at all. Overall at $8.00 a bottle I am not sure that I would do it again, it was good but the price brings the drinkability way down; but even now as I enjoy the warm after affects of the 10+% I wish I had some more."
"**according to the helpful user mandelbrot, in U.S.A. North this adjective can also mean ""awesome."" That makes more sense."
"Being a quintessential Belgian, there is a noticeable spice presence in the flavor. Somewhat spicy notes of coriander are opposed by a weighty dark malt backbone. Raisins, plums, and brown sugar are present. There is a warming alcohol finish to compliment the strong flavor. Mouthfeel is rich and smooth. Even though this is of high alcohol content, it is imminently drinkable, and another true gem from Unibroue."
"Its alright. Not sure about paying $7.99+T for another, though. Quite like a Nut Brown Ale on steroids, having been amply yeasted. Surprisingly light for a 10+% ABVer. The flavor really grows on me. It gets more delicate and tasty as it warms; at 50% gone: I wish I had more than 50% to go. At 100% gone: yes, fun to try."
"An excellent ale that pours a three finger, thick light brown head fades slowly leaving a good lace. Good carbonation and medium bodied. Nose is a malty alcohol. Very deep amber, almost black color. Starts smooth and malty and finishes with an alcohol overtone. Ages well, bought Sept 2006 bottled 2004, best by Aug 8, 2007. $6.22 for a 750ml bottle from Smiley's Beverages Dover, NH."
"I finished the bomber by myself and boy am I feeling the buzz. Not sure its a beer I'd have everyday (if I did, I'd be broke by Monday..), but one of the best beers that's widely available."
"D - very nice sipper, be careful of abv, it will sneak up on you."
"Well, La Terrible is not terrible at all - It's a delicious sipper - and a slow sipper to be sure. A nice, complex brew, though I don't know that it's one of my favorites from this great brewery - Still in all, I like it!"
"Poured from a bottle into a tulip. This ale poured a deep brown color with a huge fizzy tan head that slowly faded away. A bit of light lacing is left behind. Some ruby highlights and active carbonation are visible when held up to light. The aroma is made up of dark fruits, brown sugar, plums, and sweet malts. The smell is very vinous. The flavor consists of dark grapes, cherries, plums, light malts, and some bread. The mouthfeel is thin and fizzy. A bit of a dry finish. The high alcohol is hidden perfectly. A decent ale, but other examples of this style really overshadow this beer."
"Very dark color. Huge head that settles nicely. Rich flavor that is a little fruittier than I prefer. Goes down smooth and sits light. Doesn't feel like you just ate after drinking a few (1pt. 9.4 oz/ per). It also doesn't have a strong alcohol taste @ 10.5."
"Definitely not for the meek. I wish I had more..."
"Quite drinkable for the ABV which is well hidden."
"A full bodied dark ale that is a fine example of the style, the mouthfeel is smooth with a zip of tartness to the fin. Overall...a strong brew that's very enjoyable."
"Overall, an excellent beer. I dont know what more to say about it. Just a great beer."
"Beer poured a dark burgundy brown with a very long lasting tan head. Nose has a very fragrant boquet, of sweet malts, dark fruits, light fruits, and spices. Taste is a near perfect blend of malts, with hints of figs, apples, plums, and a slight dry hop finish. Mouthfeel is perfect. The beer goes down extremely smooth and this is perfectly carbonated as it goes across my palate. Drinkability is near perfect. The alcohol is extremely well hidden. Excellent job of brewing by the Canadian leaders!"
"not too drinkable, but very good all the same."
"Drinkability: I couldn't drink this every day, but enjoyable."
"This beer poured black with a very nice head. The lacing is impressive. The aroma is a mix of Belgian candy and a spicy scent. The taste is spicy (licorice?) and malty. There is a bit of a candy taste as well. The mouthfeel is full and carbonated. Overall, Id consider this a very interesting brew that falls under the category of quite drinkable. As a side thought, I would like to drink one that has been cellared a few years."
"To date this is one of my favorite beers since I have started my cellar collection. My girlfriend agrees."
"2004 vintage, opened April 2007. Poured out a cola brown color with a thick creamy tan head dotted with yeast. The nose was surprisingly tame. good malting, some raisin and prune, tiny bit of alcohol. The taste was a diferent matter. Big bold and sexy, lots of malt, slight coffee, slightly heavy yeast notes that swim lovingly withthe malt. Everything just gets along really well here. Very nice. Has a tickly mouthfeel, but finishes very clean for such a big malty mess. Big flavor, but very dirnkable."
"The high carbonation really pops in your mouth. Very rich and full-bodied feel. Definite alcohol warming feeling hits you fairly quickly, making it the only hardship I find in finishing my 750mL bottle. The taste is amazing, the smell and appearance are top notch. This is an amazing beer, hands down."
"-Oelergud"
"Judging by the bottle and the taste, you'd think that this was drawn from some dark well in some cave or castle! There's a nice mystery to it. Not as complex as some similar beers, but this still has a balanced and unique flavor. I prefer some of Unibroue's other Belgian strong dark ales, but I'm sure that I will get this one again."
"Drinkability: This is one of the reasons I started drinking craft beer and I am so glad I did."
"Just taking the cork off reveals a nice sweet and spicy aroma and it pours out a nice dark color with deep red undertones and is topped off with a thick creamy light tan head. It has a smooth but sharp taste (almost tart) when it first hits your tongue; but you can quickly taste the spiciness in it. It just has a great taste that just rolls onto your tongue and really wakes up your taste bud. It has a nice mild spicy aftertaste thats really leaves you wanting another sip."
"One of my favourites from Unibroue, although the taste could use a little beefing up."
"2004 vintage that I have been cellaring since purchased in Montreal Sep 05. I had heard that there had been problems with the 2004 corks so I was somewhat concerned opening this baby. I pulled the cork and pop! Poured with great fizz and gusto! Relief The color is a very dark- held up to the light the ruby comes through. Lots and lots of floaties with great lacing. Smell is of sweet fruit and candy. Taste- damn that is smooth! Much smoother than Trois Pistoles. Dried fruits and bakers chocolate with a dry finish. No noticable hops. The house yeast isnt too noticable here. This is an awesome beer and would be exceptional with a fine meal (mine was experienced with chicken soup). This is the best Unibroue that I have experienced to date."
"This is a well balanced beer, which is superb considering the alcohol content. It's almost way too drinkable, but you won't find me complaining. Hands down one of the best from Unibroue, right next to La Fin Du Monde..."
"Drinkability is good. I'm finishing off the full 750 without much problem, but definitely couldn't go beyond that. It's a sipper, but the flavor of this makes you want to drink it on down. I got this beer to relieve myself from the typical US hop madness and reacquaint myself with some great Belgian styles. Before popping this one open, I had questioned this choice over some of the classics from Belgium, but after a few sips, I was certain it was a great choice. Are we sure this is from Canada? It's a great brew for a penny a ML. If you see it, get it. Tasty."
"Date on cap was 2004 with a drink by date of 8-8-2007. Pours a dark brown, borderline black with a fairly think off-white head that dissipates rather quickly. Smell was mostly dark fruits and spicy with some minor alcohol coming through. Taste was mostly fruity and spicy, with maybe some slight caramel flavor mixed in. Medium to full-bodied with a fair amount of carbonation. Alcohol was masked fairly well and this was avery easy to drink beer for the alcohol content. A solid brew."
"Terrible is hardly something you can drink all night, but remains a spectacular brew that screams Belgian and should be recognised for its greatness."
"This stunning beer is, by far, my favorite Unibroue offering and is the best beer I've ever had from the Great White North. It's a classic BSDA that I would have sworn hailed from Belgium if I had encountered it in a blind taste test. Forget the overall score, it deserves to be thought of as a '4.5' beer at least. La Terrible is a great name, but a more appropriate one would be La Fantastique."
"A strikingly dark and opaque beer with perhaps a hint of crimson tinging the blackness. A generous, frothy tan head tops it off and sticks around for a little while. The nose is undergirded with lightly toasted malts, with a whiff of cardamom standing out among the spices. The taste is a nicely blended mix of slightly roasted malts, fruit, and spice; again, cardamom particularly comes to mind. What strikes me is that the heavy alcohol component is nicely integrated, to the point of being masked. Mouthfeel too is unexpectedly smooth--actually more creamy than astringent. This went down all too easily."
"All things considered, I find La Terrible to be one of the best beers I've tasted and it will probably remain a high favorite of mine for life."
"had this sitting in my basement for a while waiting for the right time to come to try it had a 2004 on top of cage after the fight of opening the bottle time for the poor looks like a rather dark and mysteroius liquid not much for color other than black smell is on par what i expected i cant pick out any thing specific from it. it had me from the first sip rather dry kinda spicy mostly dark fuit flavors come across to me mouth feel is once again on par with what i expected i found no problem wishing i had more once i was done very drinkable in my book"
"Great beer."
"Verdict: impressed. I felt that this beer had a dark raspberry backdrop that let other flavors show up on top of it, creamy chocolate and vanilla, as well as belgian yeast and spices. I didn't even mention alcohol in my notes, I think I forgot it was there."
"Very nice."
"A very nice beer. Alcohol limits enjoyment to one."
"The mouth is full-bodied and complex, finishing sweetly with some sugar sticking to the lips. I might like a tad more carbonation. It's pretty drinkable, the alcohol is rather gentle for a 10.5 ABV, though the sweetness might get a bit cloying after more than one of these. Very solid overall."
"Bottled in 2004, best before 08-08-2007. Loud pop of the cork means this one's not a casualty of the corking misfires Unibroue apparently suffered a couple years back. Tawny chestnut, murky russett brown with a thin but clumpy ecru head. Scents of dark berries, black mission figs, and red grape skins mingle with grassy yeast funk and warm zucchini bread aromas. Brown sugar-laced marshmallows set inside pitted prune plums that were left out to dry but still retain some thick juice. Freshly mown spring hay, currants, and blackberries with a tannic edge. Warm yogurt-like lactic twang. Mellow peppery buzz to the mouthfeel. Rather dry overall with a curt finish. 10.5% alcohol is completely hidden. Incredible drinkability. This was the only bottle I bothered to pick up when I found a stash over a year ago. I wish I had more. To anyone still wondering about this one, it's drinking great at 2+ years."
"Pours a very dark almost completely dark redish black color with a decent khaki head that recedes quite quickly and doesn't leave a trace that it was ever there. Smells of chocolate, plums, sweet malts, correander, cloves and a nice other bouquet of spices. Very sweet taste but not over the top. The taste is pretty spot on with the smell and definitely hides the 10.5% abv very well although it does leave a bit of a warming feeling. Carbonation is spot on however (and I'm being really picky here) it is a wee bit too watery for my liking. Overall I really enjoyed this one it's a good Belgian dark and comes with a kick!!!"
"This went very well with the stout and cheese fondue and stout mocha freeze ice cream. Tremendous meal by Jen, kudos to you! This is my favourite beer by Unibroue thus far. Definitely a sit back and kick the feet up sipping beer. Subtle, smooth, mellow and relaxing. Definitely doesn't live up to it's name."
"It's been a hour or more on this bomber and my only regret is that it is the only one that I have."
"Drinkablity is pretty good despite the 10% abv."
"This beer starts out strong, and really gets better and better with every sip. Pours a hazy brown color with many particles floating around. The smell is complex and much like a Belgian quadruple, with candied fruits and other sweet odors. The initial taste is almost of putting, and is much like a Belgian strong ale. But as the beer goes down, it starts to develop much more of a fruitier taste, with a perfect amount of carbonation that ensures there is no lingering. Quite a beer, definitely something to seek out."
"D - pretty tasty, I'd recommend it."
"Drinkability - It's actually very easy to drink, but I don't think you'd want to drink to much. Just by writing this review, I'm starting to feel a tad funny."
"D: This beer could still use another 1.5 - 2 years in the bottle before cracking it open. Still, very good but the age could remove some of the cloying characteristics that accompany this brew."
"The aromatics are far and away the best aspect of this brew. La Terrible certainly isn't terrible, but it just isn't an elite version of the style."
"Still it comes highly recommended."
"This is the best $9 bottle of wine you can buy. Extremely dark black in color, smells of raisin/tannins and alcohol. Cork smells like licorice. The licorice and fermented grape dominate the flavor, which is really well done. The taste expands upon the nose in a predictable but welcome way - exactly what I had hoped for and expected. A very suitable, easy to obtain, and cheaper alternative to a favorite Belgian dark (call it Rochefort 7), much as Fin du Monde is to the pale ale. I enjoy that they mute the distinctive yeast somewhat in this brew; at least it is differentiable from Trois Pistoles and Maudite, while very much belonging in the Unibroue fold. The mouthfeel is oh so slightly thin, with a tingly carbonation when first popped. Obviously the alcohol comes to dominate as the beer warms, the 10% will catch up - drinkability rating suffered (one 750 ml is enough for one night). I recommend the sediment for the last pour, the yeasty flavors help take the edge off the esters. Worth your time: If New World homages to Belgian ales are your thing, this is an outstanding example."
"I wouldn't be the first to point that La Terrible may be the most inaccurately named beer. Still, while it is good enough to satisfy even high expectations it isn't exactly the friendliest 10.5% dark ale to cuddle up with. Like some other Unibroue beers, it's hard to tell whether the intention was a beer or a documentary on yeast. Nevertheless, buy a bottle, stash it away, wait for those hard edges to turn soft and then enjoy!"
"This 2004 bottle of La Terrible poured incredibly dark. And by dark I mean I held my Trappistes Rochefort glass chalice NEXT to a light bulb and nothing was seen through the terrible darkness. Very thin, tan head formed and faded quickly like the wisps of vapor that materialized after uncorking. Smelled delicious from far away as well as up close. Strong red wine and grapey aromas. These associations reinforced in the tasting with some rum hints, molasses, faint maple. Has fairly strong alcohol content all in all making it harder to consume en mass. An excellent, excellent beer and much better than I remember it, perhaps due to the aging."
"Overall this is excellent. This may not be quite what its Belgian counterparts are but its damn good. I'm immensely pleased that I picked up a bottle of this brew. I didn't pour this when it was terribly cold but the flavors really came alive as it warmed. I enjoyed this beer tremendously the warmer it got."
"But the beer is so good that I can't really hold any of this against Unibroue, and I certainly pick up another bottle if I have the chance."
"This pours a very dark mahogony with a tan fizzy head that disappears very quickly. The smell is musky, with sweet malt,alcohol, and some sweet fruit. The smell is a little light,but very interesting and different. The taste is crisp,clean with vanilla, sweet malt, cherry, and a nice alcohol warmth. The m/f is medium with the flavors mixing well. A very good beer with a flawed appreance. The head is WAY TOO fizzy and disapates too fast. Other than that this is a good quality beer from a brewer who knows what their doing."
"This is a good drink. Try it. I got it for $7/bottle at a grocery store (Wise Way in Crown Point indiana), and would recommend getting ONE to try. You may go back for more, or like me you may not. It is worth the try."
"Poured a dark brown color with ruby highlights. The tan head doesn't stick around very long. The aroma is of dark fruits and was quite yeasty. The spiceyness was not overdone but very pleasant.In the taste we have more spice but also a light must. IT is really malty and fruity. Cherries possibly. The alcohol is not detectable for a 10 and a half abv. I thought the mouthfeel was a tad watery, but still it was kinda slick and tingly fromthe carbonation. Not bad i suppose. This was soo drinkable but one 750 is obviously enough."
"D- I didn't like this much at all. I couldn't have more than about 3 or 4 oz."
"The taste is very complex and flavorful. The foamy head makes it almost seem as if you're swallowing twice, but this only prolongs its enjoyment. The taste is extremely enjoyable and drinkability is high; bready, slightly yeasty, and with a taste of dark fruits. The alcohol is actually not nearly as prominent as you'd think from such a highly boozed beer, but makes is presence known regardless. The beer is drinkable enough that it doesn't matter and is an excellent example of one of my favorite beer styles."
"D: I'm so torn when I get to this part of a review with a strong Belgian ale. Would I have another? Probably not, because it's close to 11% alcohol. But I'm not going to penalize the beer for that, as this is a terrific beer. I kept thinking about its wine-like qualities from the moment I popped the cork and the aromas escaped the bottle. In moderation, as a sipping beer, it's wonderful."
"A member of the upper echelon of Strong Belgian Ales. Be sure to try this one out."
"Overall, this is a very rich, malty, spicy, and moderately dark fruity beer. It is so smooth you will want to go buy another 750ml bottle after you finish the first one. This is, yet again, another MUST have from Unibroue."
"La Terrible is a solid Belgian Strong Dark Ale. Recommended."
"Flavor is figgy, bready, yeasty, raisiny, cherry-like... very nice."
"750ml bottle, best before 8/8/07. Dark, dark red-black color, with a sweet, dark fruit aroma. Very pleasant. It tasted sweet, cherry, some chocolate. A little bit of warming spice in the background. Wonderful. Pretty well carbonated. An enjoyable beer to drink, didn't notice the 10.5% ABV."
"750ml bottle split with my cousin. Smells wonderful. Very fruity. Big thick head but quickly runs down to a quarter inch which lasts for the entire beer. Strong. Writing this with a good buzz. Inconsistent lace. Not even lace. Just spots of bubbles. Appears very dark brown, almost black. Held to sunlight appears dark reddish brown. Ruddy. Taste: Difficult. Doesn't disguise alcoholic content as well as trois pistoles, but it's also a little stronger. After taste is wonderful."
"10.5 Abv %, but sooo easy to drink regardless."
"Pours a dark brown color with an off-white head but left no lacing. Smell is full of dark fruits, caramel, etc. Definitely on the sweet side, but nice. Taste has qualities reminiscent of red wine; it's also quite yeasty and has some different dark sugar flavors. Mouthfeel, the carbonation jumped on the tongue right away, seemed a little high paired with a medium body. A good beer definately worth trying, perhaps twice, but I wouldn't throw a fit over not finding any."
"D-High alcohol will limit drinkability for many. I had to share this bottle. I might have been stingier if it was cooler out but strong ales don't work when it is over a 100. Very tasty beverage overall and I intend to revisit this again in the fall."
"Pours almost black in color. Tan head is the supper small bubbles that give a great foamy appearance. Head sticks around for the entire glass. Smell of dark fruits and rich malts. Also some woody character. Taste is a wash of complexity that blends perfectly. Wood, plums, malt all in a very tasty mix. Slight spicyness in the finish. Carbonation is high which gives an active feel on the tongue. Unibroue comes through with a winner again. I've loved everything I've had from them and can't wait to try more."
"Cheers!"
"[ serving type: bottle ]"
"This ones a fantastic sipper that would easily find itself at home in Belgium."
"10.5% ABV is extremely well concealed. This one is a lovely, sipping dark ale. Best shared between a good friend. Enjoy another fine brew from Unibroue!"
"Drinkability - this decent, not great. Goes down fairly well. I'd have this only once in awhile. High abv is another limiting factor to sessionability."
"Overall: there is little doubt I will uncork a bottle or two of ""La Terrible"" at the next gathering I attend. The taste and quality are superb. I highest endorsement though is that my fiance, who is not a beer fan, tried this one and really enjoyed it. Kudos to Unibroue for another fine offering."
"Drinkability: Chambly Noire is more affordable and drinkable, while Maudite has more too it. The odd front palate was distracting and detracted from the beer. Will revisit this one day at room temperature, and adjust my scores if they need to be."
"For the first 10 minutes or so, this beer is maybe a 3.4, but as it warms and gains its fruity, malty complexity, it improves to maybe a 4.2. On a whole, I'd have to put it somewhere in the middle. Not Terrible, but nothing transcendent either, I'd probably prefer one of their standards like Maudite or Trois Pistole anyday."
"Corked and caged as a 2004, should cellar well, but this just doesn't impress me. Bad bottle? Maybe. I'll have to find some fresher stock and try it again."
"The best Unibroue so far."
"Good beer, I like it now much more than I did the first time I tried it. Alcohol level is well masked considering its strength."
"Taste is strangely complex, but I'm not sure in a good way. I'm getting figs, apples, yeast, sugar, strong alcohol (almost vodka-ish), and an aftertaste of chocolate creme and roasty malts. Mouthfeel is surreal, because it's thin but with a harsh carbonation. This isn't a very smooth sipper, and I almost feel compelled to drink it faster to get it over with. I don't know.. it's getting hot in here."
"Decent drinkability but the alcohol gets to you."
"Easy to enjoy but could only enjoy a few glasses as the 10.5% ABV starts to make its presence known."
"I have yet to be disappointed with Unibroue.... everything they make is great. I'm happy I had a chance to sample this again, before it's gone."
"Tastes rich and incredibley smooth. Very subtle flavors run into one another very niceley, well balanced. Some very light yeasty tastes with hints of a very very light tartness. Slight warming at the end but alcohol is barely there. Very drinkable and I could certainly have drank a few more glasses."
"Pours dark mahogany-brown, like some kind of a cola. Thick creamy head also, like a milk shake. Nose is surprisingly sweet, I was expecting alcohol notes. Dark fruitiness, raisins, winelike in the nose. Taste is quite good as well with a myriad of fruits (grapes, bananas, pears) like an extra dark sangria or fruit punch backed up with hefty malts and only hints (great) of alcohol. Only issue with this, as with most Unibroue's, is the immense carbonation, so be sure to drink it slowly."
"From an '04 750ml bottle ... cellared with love in my very own basement. Poures a solid, almost opaque reddish/black color. Deep ruby tones in the light, along with some massive yeast sediment. Head is light brown and does not retain long. Nose is of a very earthy, woodsy attitude. Stewed fruits - prunes, raisins, and dates. Very distinct port wine-like aroma as well. Palate is so very complex, echoing the nose. Prunes and raisins, along with aged oak. Hints of port wine, cherry, and sweet mollasses as well. There's a lot going on here ... a lot. Slightly biting and a decent carbonation level. Medium heavy mouthfeel. Very smooth, woody, and slightly sweet. Subtle, especially after about 2 3/4 years in the cellar at 55 degrees, yet very, very complex. Finishes incredibly smooth, mellow, earthy, and delicately sweet. An absolutely GREAT dark Belgian-style brew. One of the very best, I believe. Astonishing!"
"As it tumbled from the bottle into my glass it looked dark brown. Once it completely settled, if someone had told me it was a stout, I wouldn't have been the skeptic. A nice creamy looking head covered the top. Honestly, a gorgeous looking beer. The only thing that kept it from being a perfect 5 appearance wise would have been the lack of lacing. Nose was strange ... it brought to mind a mix of breadiness and Welch's grape juice. Taste is of plum sweetness, sugary cotton candy and a bit of butter. The butter does not show through until the liquid reaches room temp. I honestly wasn't too impressed with the taste until it reached said temp. Alcohol is very well disguised, almost nonexistant. Mouth is very very creamy. While this is a pretty good beer, I'm in no rush to have another. There are far better Unibroue offerings."
"D - I shared this bottle with some friends and noone drank more than half a glass. While enjoyable I am not sure I'd want to work my way through a full bottle. Good to try but I prefer some of their other brews."
"Well mark down another vote for cola looking beer, with the way the head acts, large bubbles, and the color of the beer. Smells of apples very strong at first, but it changes to a more general fruityness and some dark malt anise. Taste is not good, well it is the aftertaste specifically. Not so much bad as annoying, because of the weird anise taste that reminded me of fresh mulch. I wouldn't not try it again, but not on my dime."
"A very dark brown/black beer. Has a small creamy light brown head. Notes of molasses, nuts and candy weave back and forth in the aroma with some alcohol in the background. Dried fruit, figs and raisins, combine with a hint of licorice. A little light on the palate for a beer with such darkness and alcohol. The is a nice roasted malt character that stays with you long after the swallow."
"i would have liked to be able to compare it to a young bottle, but my guess is that is has mellowed in its age; it certainly is not the flavor monster i might have expected"
"bready, malty sweetness in the taste. finishes with a touch of alcohol sweetness. mouthfeel is where this one falls short of the best belgians: fizzy, tingly carbonation, medium-light texture. a very good brew and by far my favorite of the unibroue lineup."
"Pours out a deep ruby brown, almost opaque black color. Big tan head that will foam over if you aren't careful. Lots of small chunks of yeast settled out and covered the bottom of the glass. Pretty intense aroma with raisin other dark friuty characteristics. Flavor is more wine-like than beer, tastes of dried fruit, some burnt and smoky tastes, but unfortunately the strong alcohol seems to burn through and overpower some of the other flavors. Thick, velvety smooth mouthfeel, one to enjoy slowly, small sips go down easy, but again the 10.5% alcohol seems a bit too much. Good, but I like Trois Pistoles better. Maybe should keep one and let it age a few years and see if it mellows a bit."
"Alcohol is well-masked but heavy, but such a balanced and refreshingly light dark ale. Complex, but not in the hard-hitting way of Trois Pistoles, truly a unique Unibroue concoction. Not my favorite of theirs, but something to savor."
"Not a good session beer to be sure, but drinsk good for its ABV . Great with strong cheese or these spicy green chille pistachios I'm enjoying right now! Worth the $$"
"Drinkability: Very good. This is not a favorite style (which does little to explain why I have 15 of them in my garage) but this one is very tasty. Not the most complex beer I've ever had, but the flavor it does have is very good."
"pours a very dark brown with red highlights in a chalice. head is a 1 inch light tan that drops to a capper fairly quickly. thick ring around the glass laces well. first aroma is a vinous grape juice with spices like corriander and pepper. first sip is corriander and pears with a light alcohol tingle and a noticible creamy thick body. grapes, raisins, dates, and maybe prunes. dark, lightly sour fruit with a sweet and yeasty bitter finish. when paired with a horseraddish monterrey, strong oak flavors came forth along with prune/plum characters. truely a wide array of flavors. alcohol fusels become more evident after warming. mouthfeel is, again, creamy, thick and rich with a champaign-like carbonation. swallows very smoothly and rolls around with a light alcohol prickle. drinkability is quite good considering the 10.5% abv, but take your time with this one. it can definitely sneak up on you. overall, this is quite a belgian strong dark. very flavorful with a smooth mouthfeel. i wouldn't say this is my favorite, but it's up there. a must try. i'm interested in how this one matures."
"Still, this brew stands on its own, unique, interesting, and genial. Another winner from Canukistan."
"Drinkability: So powerful and complex, it is difficult to drink very much of this"
"A winner."
"Wow. Wow. This stuff is good. Pours a huge gloppy head (pour verrrry carefully) and a very close and dark brown color. The smell is hard to describe, it's different. Smells kind of musty, to be honest, not in a bad way, it just smells musty. After one glass I can feel the 10% alcohol starting to warm me up, and I still have the rest of the 750 bottle. The taste and flavor of this thing blows me away. It's sweet and fruity, almost like brown sugar and bubblegum, but at the same time it's very balanced and not cloying in the least. It's a fresh sweetness, not the syrupy alcohol sweetness I sometimes expect from a high alcohol beer. I'm in love. It's not heavy at all, it feels quite light and bubbly in my mouth, but it feels perfect for this particular beer. Very enjoyable, probably my favorite from Unibroue."
"Drinkability - tasty stuff as well as potent."
"D- This beer has a nice dark fruit and sugar flavor with some other dark malt flavors. This is a well-built and smooth drinking beer."
"2004 Edition. This beer poured a dark brown color with a thick one inch head into my Duvel glass. A strong winey aroma wafted from the glass, with a good dose of spices too. The taste was exquisite, rich and malty with notes of spices, anise, molasses and ripe fruit. As the beer warmed, I detected hints of port and sherry and dark rum. This beer was quite similar to Trois Pistoles, but a bit more full bodied if that's possible. A perfect nightcap to a winter evening."
"Thanks Dave for sharing this with Jason and myself - next Terrible beer is on us."
"Quite a delicious sipping brew, by far my favorite that I've tried from Unibroue. A world class brew by anyone's standards, and one that likely benefitted from a year of aging."
"I have no idea what terrible means to Les Quebecois, but it means incredible to me."
"The usual Unibroue large bottle, caged/corked, with a tiny ""Sep 9, 2003"" stamped on the rear of the bottle. Not much energy upon twisting the cork out, minor tan head, leaving a slight tiny bubble film and minimal lacing, Pours darkest of shades of muddy brown. Nose of powdered sugar and cola. Strong, tasty, and bold brew, notes of cola, whiskey soaked prunes, brandy, dark candi sugars and smoked oily lifesavers. Vinious, warming alcohol present and enjoyable. Complex and worthy Canadian/Belgian."
"from the bottle served at cellar temp. date stamped september 9th 2003. poured deep mahogany with a light tan head that left some lacing. aroma musty a sourness, malts, caramel, chocolate, strong presence of alcohol, woody. flavor wow had a hard time just picking the 1st thing I tasted got so many differant thing, caramel, honey, dark fruits, raisins, alcohol, malts, chocolate toffee. got some sourness and bitterness all in a good way. this aged very well."
"overall- compared to the st. bernardus abt 12 i had the other day, this is a bit more raw and unblanced. although it has a year under its belt, i believe a couple more years to mellow this out would yield some pleasent results. nonethelss as it sits in front of me this is an outstanding beer."
"Drinkability? To me, the ABV is evident all around."
"At first sip, I thought it had a thin feel. After a while I began to change my mind. It has a moderate to medium body and is nicely carbonated. Drinkability is fine too. I'd have no problem sipping on this for an entire night."
"The best part of this beer is the bottle conditioned mouthfeel. That tremendous carbonation never fails to impress. As of now, this beer is a bit too strong to drink and will benefit from a few years in the cellar."
"I've read forums that this beer is coming off of the market. If that is the case, stock up as it is a keeper."
"This is a really nice offering from Unibroue that is complex on the palate. It's one of those beers that gets way better as it warms to room temp and very drinkable at 10.5% ABV."
"Pours an opaque dark brown, almost black, with nice red highlights around the edges, big off white head forms, stays thick and laces all the way. Smell is licorice, chocolate, caramel, spice, coffee, some yeast and alcohol, with some dark fruits thrown in. Taste is the same, licorice up front, with chocolate/coffee, and cherries/strawberries. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with high carbonation. One of the better Unibroues."
"Black, black with rosey purple edges, tan head that hangs around forever. Nose is Belgian yeast, just a bit off from having a strong dark fruit odor. Taste starts off rather thin, but quickly revs up to an expected dark fruit flavored ale. The finish is dominated by an alcohol burn that makes it taste spicy hot, like crushed black pepper. Mouthfeel fills through the middle. This is too high in ABV and the alcohol finish is just a bit too aggressive to make this a highly drinkable brew. I thoroughly enjoyed it and recommend it for an after dinner brew."
"This beer might not be a great session beer. It has a great flavor, but the alcohol content is just a little high. Since the alcohol is hidden so well, it might be easy to throw back more than a few."
"Drinkability: Gods this is evil stuff. I could suck this down on any given day. Just a perfectly balanced beer goodness."
"The texture is smooth and velvet-esk. Good on the phenols considering the high alcohol. Overall I think this was a good treat."
"750 ml corked bottle. Terrible pours out a dark brown color with a small head. Potent aroma of yeast, apples, and spices. The flavor is very spicy, with lots of flavor from the yeast. Apple skin tartness. Sweet, but not cloying, and the high carbonation seems to carry the sweetness away. At times, I detect some cocoa flavor. The flavors in this beer really work together well. Full mouthfeel. Drinkable, considering the 10+% abv. Another winner from one of the most consistent breweries around."
"Opinion: I have been really pleased with Unibroue, and this is no exception. This beer is complex and very well presented. I would highly recommend giving this one a shot if you like strong dark ales."
"Overall I feel this is a beer worthy of competing with the best. I have always been very impressed with the brews Unibroue cranks out. They have always been very true to style and some of my favorites. I would recommend this beauty to anyone who's in the mood for something a lot less everyday."
"Big cork-and-crown 750 ml bottle, best by 8.8.07. Pours deep deep red almost to the point of brown - like a thin porter - with a fizzy 1 finger head that reduces to 1/4"" of fine bubbles and leaves good lacing on the second glass. Smells of oranges, raisins, and pepper, with a hint of melon, but overall it isn't very strong. Tastes like honeydew melon/rind, sour apple, pepper, molasses, spiciness, mild bitterness, a grassy/musty character, and perhaps some kind of berry. Very good. The body is thick and smooth but retains some carbonation throughout - also quite nice. The drinkability is up there for a beer of it's strength - I split this bottle but could have easily drunk the whole thing myself. Delicious."
" -cheers2beers-"
"This isn't terrible at all, its fantastique!"
"D = Excellent. Definetly one I will be drinking again. One that you can sit down and slowly sip. Great Unibroue beer."
"This Terrible offering pours a deep dark brown with ever so slight hues of red. A nice slight off white head is present, stays for a spell and fades to a stubborn lace. Aroma is a mix of plums, raisins and spice and candy sweetness mixed in. The 10% is nicely hidden. Taste pretty much goes hand in hand with the aroma. Fruit candy and alcohol mixed ever so nice that one doesnt overpower the other. A nice fruit feel with a slight touch of the alcohol in the end. Smooth and sticky on the pallet and warming to the bones. Overall this is an enjoyable beer to sit down and enjoy"
"The taste is quite good as well. Has all of the elements of the nose plus a hint of cinnamon and ginger. The mouthfeel is a bit thick with some sticky residual sugars. A bit dry. Quite drinkable and smooth for the ABV."
"2004 vintage. This beer had a moderately malty and yeasty aroma, with some definite cherry. Poured a decent creamy light brown head that completely disappeared. The body was dark brwon, almost black. Initial flavor was very sweet with a moderate, average finish. Taste was dry and syrupy with lively carbonation. Didn't really taste the alcohol until the finish. I don't think this bottle changed for the better after a year or so in the cellar."
"Drinkability - As I mentioned before I found the drinkability of this beer to increase significantly when this is allowed to breathe a while before consuming. My suggestion: just like like some wines open the bottle a few minutes before pouring, it really helps. If you don't like the first sip let the glass sit a little while. In my experience this beer changed for the better after breathing. The high alcohol percentage can turn some people off."
"Maybe I'll try it again on its own, without risk of something contaminating the palate. But not for a good while."
"Wow, a little overpowering at first, but delicious. Pours well with plenty of carbonation but not too big of a head. Very dark, couldn't see through when held to the light. Smell of fruit, taste of fruit, yeast and alcohol. Very strong but tasty. I really like this a lot."
"This brew pours a brillant dark brown color with a huge fluffy tan head. The aroma screams of dark fruit and spices. The taste is full of spices, and tangy. The mouthfeel is slightly ligher than medium bodied, with a lot of carbonation. Overall, this is another great brew from one of the best breweries in North America, Unibroue."
"Notes: A very good dark ale. I think I went intot his one with my expectations through the roof though, thus I felt a bit of a downer at first. Still a great beer though, just not my favorite Unibroue product."
"Pours a dark brown in color, nice carbonation, not much of a head though. Lacing is not bad. Scents of malts, sweet caramel. Very nice taste, alcohol was hidden, but not like other's I've had. Medium in body, very nice after taste. Very drinkable, but at 10.5 watch out, I drank a 750ml by myself and I got a good buzz."
"Drinkability- Super tasting dark ale. Unibroue never has failed me yet. Will be getting this again for sure."
"750ml bottle! Do they even make this in a smaller bottle. I picked up 4 of these and ended up drinking 3 in one night and really ended up regretting it. Anyways it was a great tasting beer very complex. It poures a dark brown almost black color and has some unique tastes like a wierd yeast taste and some nice spice to it also maybe some dark fruit, a little hoppy bitterness, and alchol. This beer is very strong so be careful with it."
"Pours an opaque, dark reddish-purple - almost black. Head is caramel in color, several fingers high, and tenacious. Leaves lacing all down the glass. Aroma is of cocoa, good red wine, raisins, yeast, spices. Amazing taste - almost knocks you flat. Very strong coffee/cocoa tones laced with multiple morphing flavors of dark fruit and freshly-baked bread. Smooth and phenolic in the mouth - swish this one around! Very difficult to review because as it warms the tastes change all over the spectrum. For a true belgian dark, it is very drinkable, but one 75dl of this is all you'll need. Trust me. Unibroue has done it again with this one - excellent!"
"Though quite dry and warming, the beer delivers a digestable feel that is very easy to drink; far too easy for the alcohol punch that the beer delivers. The beer is nearly effortless to drink."
"Mmmmm....very much like a friend of mine likes his tea (or was it women?). God I love my Duvel tulip, shows this beer off to perfection...deep black with a huge tan head which slowly dimishes leaving plenty of lace. Vinous, fruity, funky aroma giving a subtle hint of things to come. Flavour is oak, dried fruit, plums, port; very well balanced, not too sweet not to dry, very little bitterness, and almost no evidence of the 10.5% ABV. I am a big fan of high ABV beers that hide it well. Palate complements the flavours, but is not quite to De Dolle standards. If I was capable of drinking this all night, I would! Another excellent broue from Unibroue (especially after consuming a 750ml bottle by myself)."
"750 mL 2004 vintage. Dark, dark brown body, nearly black, with some light shining through the bottom of the glass. Head is light tan, creamy and hue on the pour, but fades to a nice solid layer atop the beer. Spicy, with funky Belgian yeast, dark fruit, alcohol, hops, slightly sweet, with other spices. Taste reflects many of these dark flavors, dark and funky, sweet and has a nice hoppy finish, slightly smokey which fades to a bitter end. The flavors are very strong and this beer definitely earns the name La Terrible. Another great Unibrouian beer"
"Moderately light body with exploding carbonation. This beer will catch up to you way before you decide you want to drink more. Trust me!"
"D - Great. It is soothing and delicious, very easy to finish. Naturally, a fifth of this is a bit much for one person though. Could be a perfect substitute for a reisling at a meal. I really loved this beer."
"Body hovers between medium and big. Mouthfeel is slick and juicey with a soft and creamy texture. Delicious."
"Taste is fruity, blackberry and ripe plum. Oaky and vanilla underneath. Licorice and caramel. Rich caramel malt. Sticky but a refreshing finish takes that away. Yummy."
"Great head retention, excellent yeast mix, terrific black color, tremendous punch to it and excellent drinkability."
"Bottle date is 2003. Pours a solid dark, murky brown color with a very small head over top that just rings it. The nose is very complex. I get brown sugar sweetness, spicyness, some raisin fruityness and a burst of alcohol on the end. Wow. Intense. The flavor is spicey, brown sugar, finishing very sweet rum-soaked, brown sugar infused raisin. More sweet than anything. The feel is moderate with a light carbonation. Just checked the ABV. No hint of the 10.5%. Very tasty. Maybe a touch sweet for me. Alcohol takes a back seat in this beer. Unibroue keeps me coming back again and again. I like it."
"strong flavor with darkest bitter fruits like and old ale, slick yet crisp mouthfeel with traditional belgian notes. intense flavor masks the 10.5 abv. yeasty character interjects a lone, tangy lightness into the mix. complex, tasty sipper. unibroue continues with their above average consistency by presenting a beer which drifts so far from the flavors that we expect from one of their belgians."
"Complex, interesting stuff to say the least."
"The drink of this brew should be a savored experience. If it's too cold, it may go down too fast, and then you're drunk and out of good brew and you might not have enjoyed it thoroughly! But this is seriously one hell of a craft beer."
"Even though its brewed in Canada this is a fine belgian style brew. The distinctive taste and smell that arrives with most belgians is laced in this beer. Appearance leaves something to be desired as the head quickly fades and your left with a dark punch look to it. no lacing to speak of and the mouthfeel to me was slightly off as it had massive super fine carbonation that I thought didnt fit. But what it lacks in appearance and mouthfeel it makes up in its rich flavor and a slightly sour and fruity aftertaste. It hides the alcohol content very well."
"Very drinkable for a big beer."
"750ml bottle: This one pours an opaque brown, with tinges of ruby. There was a small tan head that dropped down quickly. The aroma has a sweetness to it. There are hints of some fruits, possibly raisins and plums. Some yeastiness and breadiness also. The taste is quite good. It has many tastes of a good belgian strong, but there are hints of roastiness and coffee also. This was really good!"
"The mouthfeel is nice and bubbly, rich, heavy. Probably couldn't have a whole lot of these at one sitting, but it's by no means difficult to drink. A surprisingly delicious find- Unibroue just doesn't know how to make bad beer."
"This came in a 750 ml bottle from 2004. Poured into a goblet, this is a deep deep brown, almost black, with a mammoth beige head and good retention. Nose is very spicy, cloves and pepper coming through amongst others, with some hints of raisins and yeast coming through as well. Taste is more fruity than the nose---raisins, prunes, some tart cherry flavors, but still very spicey with a toffeeish malt flavor asserting itself as well. You can definitely taste the alchohol in this one, but it merges with the other flavors in a pleasant manner. Very full-bodied and well-rounded mouthfeel. This is an excellent beer, a little intense in it's spiceness and alchol, but very drinkable for such a high ABV."
"I poured this into to a Chimay goblet because I didn't have one for this specific brew. (Sorry Chimay, no disrespect) It pours a dark opaque color with an off-white head. The smell is of dark fruit and spices with a mild ester aroma. The taste is amazing. It too is of darker variety fruits with a spiciness. You can taste the alcohol in it too. I can mildly taste a cherry with out tartness. Good mouthfeel. Moderate carbonation. This is a drinkable beer but one to be careful with because it is 10.5% ABV. I'm am going back to the store and buying the rest of the bottles they have. I picked up this bottle for $7.00. Hell of a deal for what this beer is. I would say its not that far behind the Chimay Grand Reserve. I know that might be pushing it but its that good."
"The mouth is very nice. Creamy, but somehow thin. Its a very complex sensation of carbonation. Many sized bubbles that work in almost slow motion."
"Easily the strongest Unibroue I've had. For as wicked as it is it's pretty easy to drink, too."
"Pleasant nose of raisins, maybe plums, very enticing. Poured with no head at all, in fact it appeared to be flat to me. However, upon tasting it there was indeed a very fine carbonation. No lacing, probably due to the lack of a head, however there was clearly visible viscous legs as I drank it. Very tasty brew, spicy, fruity, complex and lingering on the palate. Alchohol is well hidden in this brew, but it has the capability of sneaking up on you after a couple of glasses. This particular bottle has a brew date of Sep 9, 2003. Quite an enjoyable brew, recommended."
"I like this ale alot and if it were a scotch, I would have it neat!"
"A great beer, which stands with the best of em. Get some MF!."
"Pours out a garnet reddish-brown. Plenty of carbonation but not an enourmous head. Smell is malty sweet, alcohol overtones and some raisin bread hints. Taste is divine, classic Belgian Brown. Lots of malty goodness, spices and yeast are etherially in the mix. Complex but not overwhelming. Alcohol is quite present, but not overpowering. Nice mouthfeel, but can't imagine having more than one of these beauties. Well worth tasting and enjoying.."
"Overall, I was a little disappointed with this. It is well made (nothing offensive about it) but a little too wine-like for me. It is surprisingly drinkable and hides the alcohol well (until it kicks you in the butt later)."
"Poured into a Rapscallion glass, formed 2"" of tan head over the very dark caramel brew. Head holds on for more or less forever, finally fading to a 1/4"" layer of bubbles after about 10 minutes, and nice foamy lacing along the glass. Aroma is spices, dark fruits, and some alcohol burn. Taste is light dark malt sweetness up front, with some dark fruitiness quick to follow, and the spicing and alcohol warmth close it out. Mouthfeel is creamy and oh-so-smooth, with drinkability that is very nice for the style."
"The beer immigrates from the 750ml brown cork and caged bottle a deep brown color with ruby high lights, the head dinosauric in size, creamy in texture and a nice tan color, and after decomposition, the residual lace forms a fine curtain to drape the glass. Nose is cotton candy sweet, a touch earthy, hints of over ripe fruit, plums I think, spice, woody, maybe even a touch of fusel alcohol, fresh and inviting, start is lightly sweet with a nice grain presence, the top is middling in its affect on the taste buds. Finish is ferine in its acidity, the hops pleasant and spicy, quite dry aftertaste with a nice bit of tummy warming from the 10.5 percent ABV, a nice drinking beer and from what Ive heard and read, you either Love It or Hate It, I like it."
"This beer has a few years under its belt, but still manages to impress. Quite enjoyable."
"This is about as close to perfection as it gets. Pours a dark brown, almost black color with little light getting through. Decent lace with an impressive head. Smell is of caramel and raisins. Taste is unbelievably complex with flavors of plum, raisins, and dates coming through in various waves. Not sweet and malty like many strong Belgians. Also incredibly smooth with no harsh overtones and stringent aftertastes. Flavors comes out best once the glass is around 55-60F (Do not drink this too cold!!!). Alcohol is completely hidden, almost to the point you don't realize it's 10.5% ABV! This is one to sip, savor and slowly enjoy."
"Overall: well balanced and very smooth to the finish to make it quite easy to drink. Alcohol not readily apparent in the taste but does kick in a bit as the sample goes on. Solid and one I will soon revisit."
"This is dangerously drinkable. The alcohol is barely noticeable and it's unbelivably smooth."
"750 ml corked and bailed bottle. Sept 9 2003 on bottle. 03-2 on cork. At $7.69 a bottle this beer was a bargain."
"The taste is much as the smell would suggest. That weird spice ambiance is frolicking about in the yeasty purple fruit flavor. The mouthfeel is deceptively light. Not light, but compared to the deep, dark color, you could get away with saying it is deceptively light. Sip after sip I grovel for the answers that elude me. Me bro and I split a 1 pint some odd ouncer and felt the creepers of the alcohol as we tried to decipher the flavours. Wild."
"Tastes of very sweet, overripe plums and brown sugar, followed by a hint of the alcohol and a very sweet finish that lingers for quite a while. Mouthfeel: medium carbonation, with a moderate body. This one is pretty drinkable for a dark ale with as high an ABV as this has. Excellent beer from Unibroue, I liked this one better than their Maudite. Time to make another run to get some other brews from them."
"Drinkability: Not bad. One of the ""slow drinkers"" you devote a good chunk of an evening too. I don't think this is the best from Unibroue, but perhaps a few months will improve it. (This was a 2004 bottle). Definately worth a try though."
"Drinkability and Overall: Another superb beer from Unibroue. I don't think I've had one of thier beers I haven't liked. This one is incredibly smooth, yet incredibly powerful. A few years of age and this will surely be a masterpiece."
"Drinkability is dangerously good. Goes down easier than most beers at half this strength. Another great Unibroue!"
"I'm very fortunate in that I live within a short drive of some top notch beer stores. I've really gotten into belgian style ales and from what I've sampled, Unibroue is as close to the real thing as it gets. IMHO,they brew the best belgian styles in North America. Terrible is perhaps their best brew. In my neck of the woods not all places that stock Uni products have this one. If you should come across a bottle, I highly recommend checking it out."
"What a tremendous product out of Chambly, Quebec, Canada. The senses are balanced. The nose runs well with the taste and both run well with the mouthfeel. Two thumbs up!"
"The strength of this beer really sneaks up on you. It's eminently drinkable."
"Drinkability: Of the four of us who drank this beer, none finished their glass, but I."
"I've tried many fine Unibroue products and they haven't let me down yet. But I think I've found a new favourite."
"I have had most of the Unibroue beers, but this was really outstanding even for them. This was rich and complex to an extent seldom found even in Belgian style beers. This would be a great beer for enjoying with Bananas Foster or another rich fruity dessert."
"750 mL. bottle, uncorked with a nice and satisfying pop. Appearance was a letdown. A brown, red, almost plum colour. Nice colour, but the disappointing thing was the head. Their was none. Just a little sea of bubbles and froth, but no real head that I expect from a Unibroue offering. No lacing either. Not impressed. Smell was pretty good. That standard Unibroue yeast smell, bit malt character, alcohol, plums, ginger, raisins, currants, figs, earth and floral hops. Taste is strong with raisins and spice. Almost a peppery tingling on the tongue. Opens up to a floral, down to earth taste with a bit of an alcohol/rum bite. Sweet throughout, and very malty. Mouthfeel is thick and almost fizzy. I couldn't drink more than a few bottles a week, but I like it. I'm wondering what'd it be like if aged."
"So I am not shy about this. I really love this beer. I mean really. The only things that ding it in the ratings are the fact that all that alcohol bite could be mellowed a little more, and I wish the aroma gave me a little more warning... but otherwise, definitely a repeat purchase. Not more than one of these a night (750mL) though, maybe even shared..."
"The mouthfeel is smooth and low on the tickling/biting carbonation oft noted in Belgian-styled beers. At a dinner party it went decently well with a dessert of 45% and 65% Belgian chocolates, vanilla ice cream, and sauteed figs in apple butter sauce. The crowd was fairly quiet about the beer, a sign that I know speaks to a sense of mediocrity. We subsist on fresh Dragonmead Dead Monk and inexpensive St. Bernardus Abt 12, so our palettes are spoiled."
"This beer pours near black like Guinness Extra Stout. The Head is a wimpy ring that leaves very modest trails of lace on the glass. The aroma is malt centred with some dried apricot and rum soaked christmas pudding notes. The taste is of dark fruits, anise, chocolate and that nice Unibroue yeast. Theres a define brandyish alcohol flavor as well. This has a very full bodied mouthfeel with an alcohol zing in my mouth in the finish. Hops arent really perceptable. A nice full bodied ale, definitely the darkest of the Unibroues. I kind of wish it had some roasty tastes, its still really good."
"Drinkability: I do like this beer, however something I believe one might better enjoy sharing. Moderation comes to mind with this beer due to its grainy nature."
"750 mL brown bottle with bottling date printed on the back. Bottle conditioned."
"Pours a very dark mahogany brown with a fizzy tan head that dissipates rather quickly, I shouldn't have chilled it so much. Aroma of cloves and prunes, and something grain-like. Taste is very smooth and great for sipping. Dark fruits, biscuity, warming alcohol, but very subtle (the alcohol that is). Mouthfeel was smooth and a little syrupy, very good. This is a great sipper."
"this is a classic brew, grab two if you find it. also, there was a little leftover in the bottle after pouring two pints, so i decided to just drink that bit right from the bottle, for fun. that was the fruitiest and best swig of the whole 750. bizarre."
"Beer is good. Happy beering."
"Deep bronze color with the antithesis of a head, slippery alcohol legs. Smells of sassafras, malt, caramel, tart wine, alcohol and spices. Flavor is sweet with dark fruits a tart middle with a light peppery finish. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with no co2  watery. I would have to say that even though this beer has no carbonation, it still has some nice qualities."
"Besides the cork issue an excellent brew."
"Very tasty. I plan on getting another to cellar for a year or two."
"I don't think La Terrible is quite at the pinnacle that some of Unibroue's other offerings reach, but it is still well worth a try if you run into it, I would be happy to have one in my hand any day."
"This is a great brew to take your time with and listen to apocalyptic folk music. Dark, heavy, and very intoxicating."
"I went back and had two more of these. One was flat and the other was carbonated. To be honest, I liked the flat one better. The carbonation seems to take away some of the flavors. I just had a friend of mine order a case for his bar. This may seem weird but, if I come across a carbed up bottle I'm going to mix it up a little in the glass and flatten it a bit. To me it tastes better."
"This example has been in the cellar for a year and I do believe that it has improved the beer. A certain smoothness has surrounded all those previous big rough notes. I had a ST Bernardus 12 before this and this beer compared favourably to that classic. A nice musty aged taste now appears in the finish and the beer has a drier profile. One of Unibroue's best cellaring beers IMHO."
"Came in a 750mL bottle with a cork. This beer pours a dark body with a tan head that sticks around. The aroma was spicy, but also had some caramel and a sweet fruityness. Very nice body on this brew. Spicy and malty with flavors of chocolate, brown sugar, and some spices and fruits. Extremely good Belgian style. Love this beer."
"Overall this beer is very easy to drink especially with the 10.5% ABV. Very well crafted and drinkable. ANother winner from Unibroue!!!"
"The brew came in a brown, 750 mL glass bottle with a September 9, 2003 born on date on the back. It poured out a red-hued, espresso-like brown with a white foam that dissipated almost instantly. The nose was fairly sweet with hints of cinnamon, caramel and raisins. A full, lightly carbonated mouthful coated my tongue and throat on the way down and left a very satisfying malty aftertaste with all sorts of fruits and spices swirling around. There were so many complex, interesting flavors I wish I could have savored this brew more, but it's so damn tasty the bottle was empty within a few short minutes. I'll definitely be buying some more of this stuff in the near future."
"Bottle dated: Sep 9 2003. Deep bister, with flashes of clear crimson when held to light. Initially gargantuan head fizzles into a middling, but dogged layer that yields sparse lace. Upfront in aroma is a combination of floral nectar tones, black licorice and clove. Secondary, but equally important are notes of singed malt, alcohol macerated raisin and hints of herbally sweet coriander. Incipient in flavor is a sweet suggestion of prune, and wildflower honey. Tempered notes of roasted grain promptly complement and lend a drying balance. Phenols are fairly prominent and are more intense than the token, often encountered clove, but are shy of becoming medicinal. Becomes minty and peppery mid palate, leaving a lingering, but agreeable spiciness indicative of the alcohol content. Hop bitterness and bitter cocoa hints emerge timidly late, and manages to offset residual sweetness slightly. Full bodied. The carbonation level and viscosity are virtually perfect. Finishes intensely floral, warm and with fading notes of baker's chocolate and anise. A unique and very tasting brew, albeit with middling complexity. I'd consider this Trois Pistoles big brother. Cellaring this for a while could be worthwhile. If La Terrible could dry out a notch, it would be superb."
"Pours a deep burgundy color with a tall foamy tan head that slowly dissipates into a creamy lace. Nose is rather complex with notes of spicy yeasts, black cherries, and an aroma similar to that of cream soda. Taste begins with sweet chocolaty malts along with notes of fresh plums. This is followed by some dark bread dough and a bit of oak leading up to flavors of raisiny port that round out the finish. A nice brew that, at a 10.5% ABV, makes for a good night cap."
"I really enjoyed this beer and although I know its not top of its class its still a very nice product that I plan to visit again. I paid 8.99 for a 750ml bottle."
"This was really a good beer. Id heard some negative things about it and had avoided it for some time, but decided to try it one day and was pleasantly surprised. Very smooth and easy drinking. Very tasty. Classic Belgian dark ale style. I think Ill try another one."
"this ale pours a dark, dark brown. little head that is gone in an instant. little carbonation. fruity overtones abound. sour raisin flavor with a bitter but subtle bite. 10.5 % alcohol is moderately hidden. mouthfeel is bready and hearty. slightly astringent. finishing one bottle will prove to be a moderate task. overly this beer was a welcome to the dark ale style, just not as good as i had expected."
"Notes: Overall a decent brew. It didn’t excite me too much, everything was mellow and smooth, very inoffensive, which is a good accomplishment considering it's alcohol content. I find that I could drink a bottle a night."
"I'm sniffing the empty goblet now. That smell just won't quit!"
"Dark brew with copper tints large brown head falls quickley to ring of foam, with lots of small bubbles rising in the center.Smells of dark fruit, plums, raisins and dark cherry, plus a light yeast aroma on top of toasted malt. Tastes oh so good, smooth malt hints of fruit with some sweetness followed by light hints of alcohol, no burn a just touch, with light yeast and hop tartness to finish.This beer is well rounded tastes wonderful and so delicious never guess its abv. I could drink this stuff all night, hell all week if I could afford too. I pray the Sleeman leaves this brewery as is."
"This is a big beer. Alcohol is prevalent, though masked to some extent by a sweet grape-like flavor that is conveyed to the tongue on the backs of thousands of bubbles that are perhaps too abundant. Finish is bitter and dry."
"it was a littel too soda like but still a very drinkable, decent brew"
"Very complex, warmth bringing out slight nuances in the fruitiness and malt. Really nice stuff, but not quite up to par with Unibroue's standard of quality. The yeast adds an awesome spicy, peppery flavor as usual, and the chocolatey malt works wonderfully with it, but I just didn't get the depth of flavor I'm accustomed to with this brewery's product. Still worth a try, at least once. If you like belgian beers with roasted malt, this is for you."
"(Cellared for two years, this beer takes on a red-wine character. Rich red-tannins. Extremely high alcohol. I smelt rich cheese, extremely-sweet malts, and heavy rich sugars to the extreme.)"
"La Terrible was served from a 750ml corked and caged bottle. In a Duvel tulip, the beer was an almost black dark brown color and was topped by an uneven brown head. The wonderful nose presented a cola-like aroma with numerous enticing subtleties: rich woody cherry esters, coffee, vanilla, melon, kiwi, field flowers, and earth....almost porter-like in the end. On the palate, a nutty, cherry-root beer roasted/alder smoky maltiness hits with accents of vanilla, birch/sasparilla and oregano(?). The finish is simply divine, kicking in with cascading cherry-earthen-coffee flavors that tingle and excite the tastebuds, leaving lingering cherry-brown sugar aftertastes. The body was superbly full and satsifying, melding very well with the flavors and character of the beer. No trace of alcohol was observed, and the beer was not noticably sweet, making for an very drinkable tasty treat. La Terrible is most definately my favorite Unibroue brew, offering an original array of flavors that I found to be fantastic."
"Pours a dark mahoganey with a fizzy, but not lasting head. Aroma is fairly yeasty and alcoholic, with some cherry hints. Flavor begins very malty. Dark fruits, and some alcohol towards the end. You can tell that this is fairly alcoholic, but you can't really taste it. In all, honesty, as one reviewer put it, it's conservative. Unfortunately, the alcohol will sneak up on you. Very smooth mouthfeel. Surprising in fact. Drinkability suffers because of the thickness and high alcohol content. Plus, it's eight dollars per bottle."
"750mL bottle poured into a tulip-style glass. It pours an opaque black color with four fingers of light tan foam. There is a bit of lacing left on the glass. The smell is very lively, with oak, plum, ginger, and figs. The taste is malty, with some sweet dates and plums. Old wood flavors mingle with roasted malt. Just a hint of alcohol burning on the aftertaste. The mouthfeel is fairly thick and smooth, and the drinkability is pretty good for a 10.5% brew. Another kickass Unibroue product!"
"This beer pours a dark coca-cola color with a modest fizzy tan head. The aroma is a faint fruit, spice, and alcohol in the background. The taste is again fruity with a pronounced dry spice note on the tongue and alcohol in the background. This is a light bodied beer that is only thin on the moutnfeel, but not the flavor traits and finishes slightly dry. This beer drinks down fairly easy for a 10.5% brew. Op uw gezonheid!"
"Very dark, nice head but could have had much better R&L. This beer is very clean, polished, sweet, yeasty, slightly spicy and citrusy like coriander. There are a lot of good flavors going on and it feels great and is very drinkable, but for some reason it lacks the ""wow"" factor. I guess it is a bit too clean and smooth, without enough esters and phenolics perhaps. Seems somehow conservative, but is a well-made and tasty ale."
"This beer pours a very dark brown/boarderline black with a very minimal tan head. There was a comprised mainly of a pleasant dark fruit aroma and a slight tinge of yeast and pepper. The taste was quite complex as it combines a variety of malt flavors. I was able to detect a sweet raisny flavor and a hint of caramel. The high ABV content is nicely disguised but a seemingly cola flavor overall. With a moderate carbonation, this provides a great mouth-feel. Overall, the drinkability is remarkable smooth, given the high ABV and yet another great beer from Unibroue! They are quickly becoming my favorite brewery!"
"The taste is dark but not too heavy. I think I would place it somewhere between Maudite and Trois Pistoles, even through it's more potent than either of them. There's almost a minor smoked taste at the end, which has me wondering. Spice is present as well."
"Easy to drink beer... tastes great and finish is pleasent too. Overall very nice."
"Nearly opaque with a thin, dark tan head. Aroma is yeasty with some sharp, sour fruity tones. Full bodied in the mouth, with a fair bit of carbonation. The flavor is malt-dominated with some sweet candi sugar flavors up front, a mild dark fruitiness to the middle, and a very pleasant, lightly spicy finish. Not mind-boggling as far as Belgian Darks go, but pretty good."
"This may be the perfect Unibroue."
"750ml Corked woth a 08-1 Stamped on the Cork Poured a a dark brown and possibly the darkest Belgian Strong Ale I've had as of yet. There is not much of a head on this one, just a very subtle thin film. Aroma is fruity with notes of cherries, some clove like spices as well as a peppery spice. The body is quite smooth and rounded with a carbonated crispness. The flavor I find similar to Trois Pistoles. It has the fruity malt and sugary sweetness as well as a spiciness that may be more dominant than the Trois. Overall this is a very nice Belgian style with a very spicy profile."
"paid $7.99 for a 750."
"Unexpected and recommended."
"I finally got to sample ""the terrible"" (thanks, Ron). I expected this to be kind of a stronger ""Trios Pistoles", and that's pretty much what it is. The biggest disappointment was that there was almost no head, and it disappeared almost immediately. Somewhat carbonated, but the alcohol is quite noticeable (in a good way). A bit more warming and fuller bodied than the Pistoles, but not as much so as Westy 12 or Rochefort. As with the Pistoles (or Chimay Blue, for that matter), let it warm, as it improves substantially. Overall, a terrific brew that I would buy on a regular basis if I could. Unibroue is a great brewery!"
"Black as night it pours,with an active tan head.The malty,yeasty nose promises good things to come.Very intriguing.The first sip is sweet ,raisiny and there is a strong alcohol present.There is some lacing on the glass as the head settles somewhat.A long finish offers more of the same along with a gentle hoppiness.A powerful ale for sure.One to sip on a cold night.I can see this as getting even better with age.Guess I better buy some more.Allez unibroue!!"
"Pours a deep, dark black with a purplish tan head. Smell is grassy, sweet, vinuous malt. Plums, grape bubblegum are there, so is the alcohol and the Uni-yeast. Taste is semi-sweet, bubblegum wine. Some tangy wheat malts chime in. Very smooth. Finish is warming with some light yeasty bitterness. Mellower than expected, but very good. Full, velvety mouthfeel. The bottle was gone before I knew it. Another Unibroue winner."
"Dark brown body topped by a cream-colored head that fizzes, but doesn't seem to get any smaller very fast. The aroma is nicely spicy, a little alcohol. Nice spicy belgian character in the flavor, but a nice clean maltiness (almost like the malt in a pilsner) rides underneath keeping it from being overbearing. The alcohol is really only felt, not as much tasted or smelled. Good beer."
"Bottle - Poured a pitch-black beer with a nice huge dark head. Carbonation is excellent and aroma is really vinous with alcohol also perceptible. Complex flavor that includes spice, raisin and a bit of roastiness. Overall, this is a great beer that could rival some of the great strong Belgian ale but the alcohol flavor is bit too strong and should have been subtler."
"Super drinkable. This is my favorite Unibroue bar none. Drinking this is pretty much ""Beer Sex."""
"Overall Impression: Terrible. Terribly smooth, terribly well made, terribly enjoyable. I’m in awe of this beer. This is the very model of an iron fist in a velvet glove. I only wish I could more accurately describe it’s wonders to you. All I can say is, seek, find, and try to understand. So happy this wonder found it’s way to Texas, I’ll be buying lots more."
"Medium to full bodied, well carbonated."
"Had this one recently, as a finish, after a sampling of Belgian-style beers and cheeses. The liquid is a nearly-black, thick fluid, topped with a bubbly, solid, large-bubbled head. The aroma is sweet, malty, and alcoholic. Alcohol and spicy phenols characterize the smell. Additionally, the sweetness in the aroma has a sugary, plum-like quality. Taste is intensely fruity and sweet, with serious alcohol warmingthis is not a subtle Belgian-style brew. Peppery, spicy, and yeasty flavors offer a nice balance to the sweetness. Full, soft, and thick. Slight hop bitterness in the finish. The beer is complex, intense, and seriousNot to be missed."
"overall, Not a bad beer I can actually say I like it. Although the alcohol is too present. Finally the first Unibroue beer I can't say sucked!"
"It pours black (dark brown held up to the light), with a tan head. Aromas of malt, clove, currant, prune, and caramel. Tastes were equally complex, with malt, caramel, prune, currant, pepper, lemon, and orange. The mouthfeel was smooth, thin and light, with small, light carbonation. It finished with lemon, pepper, and citrus peel."
"The liquid is as dark as a late summer evening with a dense guiness type of head. Well-balanced aroma of fruits (plums, prunes, bananas) and Unibroue yeast. Incredibly smooth and creamy in mouth for hidden 10.5%. World-class rich caramel, grapes, bread flavours. As PhillyBeer2112 pointed out, no component seems to take the top over others. Perhaps my favorite Unibroue product behind Quelque Chose, don't be scared of the name!"
"despite the name this beer is wonderful, as i am a sucker for unibroue. this is the darkest belgium style i think i have had from the brewery. a nice fruity aroma to offset the rich maltiness and spicy slight raisony hints...as well as those notes of the usual tell-tale tastes of the unibroue yeast/lees that you come to love. A decent bite and definitely good buzz. I could imagine this beer pairing well with a nice roast on a nippy night."
"Pours a deep deep brown with a great slight off white sticky head,aroma is fresh and malty sweet with a light smokey note.Taste has bunch of different compnents definent raisin and candied sugar with smokiness that lingers in the finish along with some ever so slight tartness.Its been awhile since I have had a Unibroue beer until today and they were well missed."
"Poured out thick and coal black with a reasonable head. There was a slight cola aroma behind the usual Unibroue fruitiness. Has a nice, medium body, complete with a gentle tingling sensation on the tongue. Tastes like a red wine, with a tart green grape aftertaste."
"This beer pours out an intensely dark color considering it's a Belgian. Probably the darkest Belgian that I have seen. Well upon pour there was no head action to speak of. I tried to get some carbonation out of it but it seemed really flat. There was no lacing while I drank this either. The smell was of bread, yeast, and alcohol, quite a nice combo. The taste was complex and original. I noticed lots of pepper and spice in this. There was also a variety of malt flavors. A biscuity flavor, some caramel, some raisiny sweetness, and a coke taste were all there. The malts were complemented with a hoppiness to balance things out. Not too bitter though but the bitterness was noticed. Yeast flavor was strong and almost overwhelming at times, as well as the alcohol. This may be due to the lack of carbonation. The beer was thick in texture but a little rough, not the smoothest. I liked it, but I think that the lack of effervescence, due to lack of carbonation hurt it a lot. I mean, who doesn't want an effervescent Belgian?"
"Dark purple hue, opaque, brownish-red influences, the faint beige head was rather rocky, about two fingers in height, it faded surprisingly rapidly to a wobbly, soapy, sparse cap that tried to maintain, as I sipped away the liquid nectar, no lace was produced. The nose is aromatic and airy with pepper, cola-like sweetness, traces of wood, mysterious dark fruits, and a note of rich maltiness. The invitation is clear enough, the bouquet is not dynamic but welcoming nevertheless. What the nose is lacking in the wow factor the palate has it in abundance. Sweet maltiness, cola, traces of plums, in the middle a big bite of spicy, flowery hops mingle with hot, spicy yeastiness, towards the end a note of chocolate emerges for a brief moment before being overcome by candied sugar, slightly toasted, it is very nice. The flavors are still raw, I enjoy big vibrant Belgium beers but an aged version might work better with this one. The alcohol seems to largely bypass the tongue and scream recklessly towards the stomach where it erupts in a volcanic fit of heat. In other words this is a hell of a belly warmer! The body is medium and it seems to jump from a thicker feel when the malt is stunningly beautiful or thinner feel when the lively carbonation does a lap dance on your tongue. The big, spicy-sweet aftertaste never allows you to forget what youve been quaffing. This is highly drinkable. I recommend La Terrible to any Belgium beer fan. Awesome, even if its a tad young. I wish I had more to cellar. My 750ml corked and caged bottle was purchased in Kansas City."
"Drinkability is great but very high alcohol makes somewhat dangerous."
"Here is review 100 of this beer. What else can one say of it? A nice dark ale with hints of fruit, good hops and not overly sweet. The high ABV is barely noticed. A perfect winter beverage, one which warms your soul while the snow falls outside, softly building up.."
"Re-reviewing this beer.Pours a very nice dark brown color with slight tan head that remains the whole way down the glass.Very yeasty,earthy aroma.Port,raison-like aroma.Somewhat malty.Wonderful flavors of black currant,chocolate,raisons and sherry.Some slight spiciness.No 10% alcohol noticed here-very smooth beer.Wonderfully full bodied.Like the other Unibroue beers this is a job well done.I have definately upped my review from the first bottle I had.I have read several detrimental things about Unibroue lately-bad batches,corks going bad etc perhaps I had a bad bottle.This is definately a classic that bears repeating."
"I'm out of this beer. Can't find any more. If you come across it, buy more than you figure you're gonna need. Go home, crack one open and then go back and buy the rest (if it's not already all gone)."
"This brew has lots of character, and while at times it seems to struggle slightly to find a definitive balance, it has flavor to spare. I wasn't sure what I thought at first, but it quickly grew on me despite some small incongruencies. Even though the parts didn't always mesh, the flavors are enough separately to be intriguing. I guess with other Unibroue offerings setting the standards, it might be easy to try to hold this one up to those paragons, but judged on its own merits, which is only fair, it holds its own. Its well above average, and in fact, downright enjoyable to drink, especially as it warms. Speaking of warming, that's just what the high ABV will do, so caution is important. Despite somewhat of an identity challenge, and all that alcohol, it's still drinkable in pleasurable moderation."
"One of the most drinkable beers of this style I've run across. Dark cola color and a waft of alcohol in the aroma caused me to brace myself for the first sip. Surprisingly moderate in the flavor profile, with abundant yeast phenolic flavors holding the middle ground. Well flavored, but not nearly so heavy or assertive as I expected. Finish was a touch on the dry side, with a white wine lingering flavor. My sample was only about 6 months old, and this was telling in a bit of rawness in the alcohol flavor, which I think would settle down with a bit more age. Although somewhat prominent, the alcohol was well integrated into the flavor. A well made product."
"Another winner from Unibroue. It pours a deep black, cola like color with a good size, long-lasting head. The aroma is overwhelming malt and hoppiness. It has some tinges of caramel with a slight coriander nose. A Belgian-style flavor that is very rich. It is complex with a malty flavor but it is so much sweeter than a stout or porter, which it resembles in color. There seems to be a hint of caramel in the taste, and a wallop of alcohol. It is crisp and slightly bitter. When you are near the end of the first glass, you can feel the alcohol hit. This is a beer to sip and enjoy but not to overdo. I still like the Le Fin du Monde and Trois Pistoles better, but this is close."
"The beer pours a deep black color with a thick tan head. The aroma is great. It is full of sweet dark malts with a bit of a Belgian style zing. The taste is far from ""terrible."" Again, it boasts a number of dark malts that contribute a sweet roasted flavor. There also is a unique tangy black liquorice flavor. It has that Belgian style taste that only makes the presence of an elevated abv. disappear. This has great mouthfeel. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This drinks very well; another kick ass selection from Unibroue."
"Dark Black..some light shines through...small fizzy cola like head...actually cola like in color...licorice on the nose...some spicy peppery notes on the nose as well..full bodied...firm...pretty clean mouthfeel...sweet rich flavor profile...tastes like a Belgian Doppelbock...rich, luxourious flavors...sweet maltiness..creamy texture...alcohol very hidden....I keep saying ""Damn this is good"" as I drink it...a fantastic brew..."
"Sampled 11/29/03"
"Good beer, but I'm ready for a change up from these guys."
"This is a big beer. Enormous fruity flavour with enough abv to complicate things. Spend an afternoon with this bottle, and enjoy all the flavours and aromas."
"Dark chestnut color with ruby highlights where the light can get through. A dark beige foamy head rises up and remains perched atop the glass. Aroma is strong and sweet, fruity and yeasty. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy upfront, and tingly across the center of the tongue into the finish. Flavor is very rich and sweet, of cotton candy and pear and cinnamon. So full and sweet, that I can chew on it. Too sweet for me, cloyingly so. In many respects this is an excellent beer, but it seems to need more balance for my tastes."
"This is an excellent beer, but I would put it in the lower ranks of Unibroues exceptional brews. I much prefer Don de Dieu or Maudite to this one, which have much better drinkability and frankly, a warmer place in my heart."
"Pours out a dark chocolatey brown to settle a very deep dark brown, nearly black, very strudy and richly thick substance thats unpierceable by light. Thick, somewhat loose dark cocoa brown head that builds a bit over bundantly, even with a slow pour. Very little lace appears and/or sticks. Aroma is yeasty spiced, cloves and peppery with a light dark fruit-like sweetness and light toffee with a nudge of roasty maltyness. Overall mostly sweet at first but the yeast dominates as it warms. Taste is about what I've come to expect out of these Belgian style dark ales with dark fruity sweetness of some raisin and plum upfront, quick full on spice at the middle with a touch of hops, subsides just as quick to a toffee sweetness and leaves trails of clove and other dark fruits of banana and dark roastyness that lingers with a subdued dryness and yeasty texture in the finish. Mellow but full mouthfeel with some solid carbonation, could be smoother, a little rough around the edges, but gets easier to handle as it warms. A good representation of the style, not to overpowering really, just the right amount of yeast and sweet malts, but lacks some complexity. A fine example by Unibroue but Trois Pistoles is nicer."
"Overall: Not one of greatest beers from Unibroue IMVHO, it lacked depth and complexity in lieu of Drinkability I found. A good beer but not one I’m sure I’d purchase again. Maybe age will better it."
"this beer is wonderful and i'd say quite drinkable, i just keep drinking it! hard to put down, hard to walk away from."
"I came out looking more like a Coke than anything. It was very dark and the aroma of raisins and hops came pouring out. The taste is loaded with dark fruits and sweet yeast! Carbonation adds a nice sharpness to the mouthfeel. Dark sugars round out this sweet brew that is accented with a nice bitter finish. Just by looking at it, I am beginning to drool. The high alcohol is hidden well, but makes it have a nice little sweet taste. This beer reminds me a lot of Gulden Drake (which happens to be one of my all-time favorite). I personally think this beer is fantastic for anyone who like strong, dark ale! I bought two 750ml bottles for $7.50 each and plan to save one for later. Congrats to anyone who has the pleasure to enjoy one of these."
"Purs a deep dark brown/garnet hue and unlike other peoples results, I have a massive foamy white head. Yeasty maly nose, and a yeasty malty taste. Another winner from our brothers up north. kind of like a higher powered Trois Pistoles. I would recommend thisto anybody who enjoys yeasty brews!"
"Poured from a caged and corked 750 ml, it's very dark brown with a small foamy head that is nothing but a memory within a minute or two. It winds up looking like a soda that was left sitting out overnight. Dark fruit-raisin and cherry-is backed by a nice peppery smell. Although the fruit and spice tastes are pleasant enough, they are overwhelmed by a strong presence of alcohol that deals a blow to the flavor and the drinkability. As a big fan of Unibroue, this one was a disappointment."
"The flavor was rather dull and the low point in the beer. I was expecting much more. Dark fruits in the flavor, grapes mostly, but some raisins and plums as well. A slight woodiness and very yeasty. Not as full bodied as I expected."
"Second Note: The more I drink this, the more I love it. Improved scores again."
"I am becoming more and more impressed with this brewery!"
"La Terrible is a force to be reckon with. I wouldn't mind setting a few bottles aside to see what develops over time. Another great offering from Unibroue. Awesome indeed."
"what a powerfully complex brew. dind't know what to expect here but have heard nothing but good things about it so i couldn't wait for my first sip. it poured black as hell with a nice tan foamy head that lasts and lasts. looks marvelous. the smell actually was quite a shock. it reminded me more of a weiss or wit beer smell: heavily citrusy and bready, but with other stuff mixed in: other darker fruits (grape, cherry, raisin, plum, etc), earth/wood, floral and a slight spiciness, just to name a few. the taste here is quite good as well. not as heavy as one might expect from the colour. actually has a nice medium body to it. fruit flavours dominate the taste, followed by a bit of spice and tartness into bread and earthiness and ending with a bit of alcohol presence which, for 10.5%, was not overbearing at all. a nice balance indeed, and a nice brew to warm me up during this lovely blizzard."
"Another exceptional brew from Unibroue, they've yet to do wrong in my book."
"well with cheese. Upgraded."
"This is a nice wine...er...beer!"
"A new experience with the pop of the cork, the brew poured out extremely dark with a nice brown head, which quickly dissipated. The smell was unassuming to me but the first taste lent itself to cloves and cinnamon. The clove sensation remained throughout the glass and the alcohol became more pronounced. I believe this would make a nice compliment to a meal more so than a sipping or drinking beverage."
"When poured, it was so dark, that it looked black with no foam or lace. The smell of spices, fruit and malts filled the nose. The taste of cloves, malts and other spices with a hint of chocolate/toffee graced the palate. Lively mouth feel with a finish recinisect of brut champagne."
"Cool silver-leafed lettering on a dark brown corked bottle, which opens with a POP! It pours a nearly impenetrable tar with a big light tan moderately fast fading head. A fairly yeasty clove-like aroma bursts forward. A scent of damp hay, malt, chocolate and hops follow, then fades. The malt body is not as full as it appears. Flavors of rye, caraway, licorice, chocolate and over-ripe banana are quite pronounced. Cloves, limes and mellow alcohol maintain equal footing throughout. A light herbal quality emerges as it warms, as does a melding of flavors, as a rounded balance occurs. This brew improves as it warms, which leads me to believe I should have let it sit a bit before opening"
"Terrible opens with a small pop and pours smooth and dark with an effervescent head that dissipates quickly. Best to catch of a whiff of it as it goes to pick up the complex nose -- chocolate, some dark cherry, some spice....anise? The taste is nothing extraordinary, but is still very pleasing....pretty much the same as in the nose, but with some roasted malt and wood. The carbonation lends a fizzy texture to the body, but the ale is very, very easy to drink. On its own, it's nothing truly remarkable -- but this is a beer that would be an excellent drink alongside a heavy meal."
"This beer was basically opague brown to black. I was drinking it in my dank & dark finished basement, so it looked more black to me. I couldn't get any red as other reviewers did. The head was a dark brown, which to me denotes the presence of roasted barley of some variety. This is all the more interesting as it is not a common malt used in Belgian-style ales of any style. The aroma was complex, fruity and mildly spicey. Had me wondering, ""just what in the heck did they put in here to make so terrible"". But the taste, my oh my, it totally rocked. To me it was a myriad of flavors, fruity yet bitter (probably from the blackened malts used). Very carbonated, so it was quite ""fizzy"" dancing on the tongue with a dry finish and a surprising maltiness. As one can see the variety of flavors and interactions they caused are nearly non-verbal. My wife -- who doesn't really drink at all -- even found it enjoyable. So there, la terrible is just don't right nasty with goodness."
"This is a good flavorful beer, but I thought the alchohol taste was a wee bit strong."
"Overall a good but not great offering from Unibroue. I like some of their other ales much better."
"This beer appears to be black. A nice looking airy and light head adorns the surface. Light brown in color, it lasts about a minute. The remaining collar provides sparse lace. The aroma has got some fume to it. Not real overbearing, but it's noticeable. I also get a distinct ""bourbon barrel"" aroma to it. Adds a nice touch to the aroma which also consists of subtle tones of bread, cookie dough, yeast and pepper. The taste also has a whiskey/bourbon slant to it. I like it in its delicate nature. The yeast tones are fabulous. Malts are so subtle in their presence. Biscuit tones come to mind. Alcohol provides a little head and leaves a light lingering sting/bitterness. Body is about light-medium. Mouthfeel quite airy, but by no means, gaseous. Unibroue brews some of my favorite Belgian style beers. This is another solid offering."
"Quite dark and forbidding, with a tan/purplish unretentive head. Smells of fruit. Plums, apricot, raisen. Nice malty character to the nose. Tastes of moderate dark fruit, as previously labeled, with the plum coming to the forefront in the aftertaste. Lovely malt character with a complex body and a bit of coffee. Alcohol very present but fits nicely into the flavor. A lovely brew with a dark side. I can see myself drinking it often of a cold, rainy day. All of these 4.5's are more like 4.6-4.7's. I really wish there were a more specific numbering system."
"This is one rich, delicious, dark, and rewarding ale. I can't quite place it above Maudite or Trois Pistoles, who have their own unique charms, which could never be overshadowed or eclipsed by this ebony delight, but this particular Belgian-style black ale is in a class of it's own. Wow! ""Terrible"" in only the best way. Yum, yum, yum, yum!!!"
"I paired with some strong French cheese (and buckwheat walnut bread) and went quite well (take THAT Cab Sav!). Overall quite drinkable, although for my dark ale money, I'd go for Rapscallion Creation."
"This beer should definately age well."
"Ok so first the bottle, awesome simplistic presentation. The color is dark brown with red hightlights giving the beer an almost purple feel to it. Fruity smell with hits of grapes, and large amounts of head that quickly fade. This beer is big malty and tasty. there are lots of flavors that swirl around in the mouth. Sweet and malty taste with the typical tart abbey style aftertaste. Overall a damn good beer, cudos to the voys from Unibroue on another excellent brew!"
"Fuck Miller. *This* is the high life."
"This beer is nearly black with a thin and creamy light tan head. Quick lacing. Similar apprearance to a Schwarzbier. The aroma is yeasty with notes of alcohol and dark fruit. Rich body with flavors of malt, plum, chocolate and alcohol. Nicely complex, and the finish is warming with a touch of hops. I really liked this Belgian."
"648"
"Poured dark, with a big head.Had a nice warm carmel malt smell, couldn't detect the alcohol(yet) Thick cocoa raisin taste on first sip, got a little sweeter on the second taste and the alcohol started to make its presence known.This is a wonderful complex brew,went out and bought another bottle right away. I'd rate this perfect if the texture was a little smoother"
"Backwash: I'm pretty sure there is a great beer in here somewhere. Hopefully, a little maturation will bring it out."
"750 bottle Sept. 9th 2003 printed above the upc code on the back of the bottle. I just couldent wait, it is a young bottle. Cork smells fruitty and grassy. Pours into the goblet rich with a dark brown/plum color. Fluffy sticky dark tan head. This settles into a 1/4 inch persistant sticky friend. Rich fruity raisen like smell. Rich smooth roast malt initial taste flows into a buttery plum, raisen. the finish is dry with a touch of black pepper. Very smooth and comforting all the way down the gullet. with a little more time in the bottle.. you will see 5's... Nothing is overt.. it is rounded, rich, smooth, and slippery. Luxury in a bottle."
"Addendum: Have a bottle that aged a couple months. Taste is better smoother and fuller."
"Certainly has all the makings of a classic. A bit young now perhaps, but I can't wait to try this one in a few years. Another great brew by Unibroue."
"it's a beer i'll try again in a few months. maybe it's just not aged long enough."
"La Terrible delivers an opaque black body with burgundy highlights beneath a long-lasting head of rocky light tan foam. The retention is good, and it slowly drops to a wide collar and lacy surface covering but leaves little lacing (most likely due to it's 10.5% abv). The nose is yeasty and spicy (coriander, black pepper?) over some dryish malt with a light touch of fruit in the background. It's lightly zesty in the mouth with a very fine, natural carbonation that warms to become creamier and smooth. The flavor mirrors the aroma with a bit more malt and fruit added to it. It's a bit sugary in its flavor, but not ""sweet"" as it's balanced by drying alcohol and a solid bitterness. The malt is a touch caramelish with a slight dark-chocolate-bordering-on-roasty note (dark fudge or brownie-like); and there's some fruit involved as well (plum/prune, dark berries, black cherry). It finishes dry with a clear note of alcohol and some residual malt and fruit. Quite nice!"
"The aroma gives plum frutiness and a is also a bit vinous in sense. There is also some light spicing to be noticed. This comes through in the fruity, spicy flavoring and along with nice warming from the spice and alcohol gives a very nice overall taste. The feel is full and lingering, leaving the beer less drinkable than you'd like to have it be as this is really great stuff to be sure."
"I'd been looking forward to trying this beer since I'd read a review from a Canadian buddy. Only thought it was going to be available in Canada. The cork said January 2003 and I feel this beer needs a year or two to mellow out the cola-like carbonation and to meld flavors. Nice black coffee color with a beige-to-light brown colored head that dies immediately. Dark fruit notes of plum and grapes in the nose. For being 10.5%, this dark strong ale is very smooth. It's smoothness masks the ABV. I think the seltzery carbonation also contributes to this phenomenon of a strong beer that seems to go down like water. Very nice taste, I was expecting something like Gulden Draak, and I was pleased to find a flavor profile unique to the spiced beers from Unibroue."
"Pours black that is some what transparent around the edges. Head lasts a fizzly few seconds then a little bit of carbonation comes threw the center and on the sides no real lace. Smells like dark bread with a slight fruit touch to it. Tasted slightly sweet with slight bitter flavor coming from the yeast in the background. No hops are apperant in the taste. A warm alcohol flavor on the finish and is very dry."
"Opaque black with ruby tint on the edges when held to natural light. Reminiscent of some imperial stouts with a large, khaki-hued head. Nice lacing. Impressive appearance. Nose features notes of dark fruit, chocolate, yeast, and sweet malt -- the aroma is inviting from across the room. Taste is complex, structured, and overall, quite ""awesome"" as the name suggests (in Quebecois, of course). Dark fruit, charred sweet malt, tobacco leaf, earthiness, currant, alcoholic and port wine notes are all present. Nice undercurrent of tart acidity, too. So deep, rich, and concentrated. Lively carbonation lends itself to a pleasant, prickly mouthfeel. Alcohol is difficult to identify even at this beer's youthful stage. Terrible drinks quite well, though it's certainly a sipper. This beer should age very well, and I can't wait to try it after it's had some age under it. Wonderful stuff and cheers, once again, to Unibroue. The brewery never ceases to amaze. Terrible, indeed!"
"This beer comes in a corked 750ml bottle with a silver painted label. On opening, I lost my grip on the cork and it hit the ceiling, but there was no carbonation overflow. The beer pours dark as night with a massive head, filling up half of my Rapscallion (RIP) snifter. Holding the beer up to the light to try to determine the color I see almost no light leaking through - it is at least as dark as most stouts. The nose has notes of corriander and clove. Taste is complex - corriander, a little smoke, some hop bitterness, a slight sourness - not very sweet at all. Mouthfeel is quite light for a beer this strong - the lack of sweetness gives a surprising drinkability. Give this beer some cellar time for the corriander flavor (if indeed it was added) to tone down slightly and this beer could get all fives. I know that I'll definitely be buying another bottle for that purpose."
"Can this brewery do no wrong? Terrible keeps the tradition of excellence intact at Unibroue. Pours out to a ruby-esque, almost porter black with a huge, light brown head that looks like candy. I swear I wanted to ""eat"" the foam. The aroma is that of fresh bread and a light plum-like smell. The taste is excellent. Malty, fruity and full-flavored while masking the 10.5% ABV extremely well. It coats the mouth and begs for another swallow. It gets better as it warms up a bit. Speaking of warming, it quietly gives you that soothing, alcohol warming effect. Excellent."
"dark almost black/murky brown, looks a lot like coffee actually. tried hard to produce a head but my efforts were useless, just a thin skim on the surface. slight hint of fruit in the aroma other than that I can't detect anything else. very low carbonation and the mouthfeel is actually not what I was expecting, kinda thin for strong dark 10.5% belgian ale. somewhat fuity-spicy aftertaste, gotta say that the 10.5% is very well hidden. Should have left this in the cellar for awhile to age/condition a little bit, I thinking that the bottle I got could have benefited from some aging."
"Shared over great beer conversation with aaronh at D's Sixpack. Appearance: Pours a very dark brown not black but damn near close, the tan head forms fully to dwindle down leaving no lace, awww. Aroma: I know this is going to sound weird but the fruit tones or port that I am getting are very reminiscient of Welch's grape soda it definitely lingers and melds well with the dark chocolate tones and touch of anise thrown in there. Taste: Syrup sweetness infused with fruit tones, bready yeast slight chocolate finish and a more ascertable anise tone in the flavor than in the scent. Finishes very nice succulent flavors perfect dark belgian strong ale. Mouthfeel: Medium body higher spritzy carbonation, once again our friends from Quebec do the Belgian brewing traditions well. Drinkability: Very smooth flavorful hard to sense the 10.5% abv making this one big beer in the faccade of being an easy drinking quaffer, I liked it."
"I opened this one to celebrate the arrival and first game of the Penguins' new goalie Marc-Andre Fleury, also from Quebec, though I'm sad to report that he and this beer were the only noteworthy parts of that night. Another simply fantastic offering from Unibroue. My only thought is that it seemed just a bit young, but with a SLIGHT bit of aging, this could truly be a classic."
"Update  I was beside myself after reviewing this back in October 2003 so thought that I would re-review it with a 2004 vintage. Man, oh man, I couldnt wait to log on to BA to raise all of my ratings just to find that I had fived everything but the Appearance. Theres not much of a head to this one but other than that this beer if perfect."
"Virtually black beer is actually a deep chestnut color, and it's topped by a tan head. Mild head retention is displayed, as it quickly fades to a thin collar. Virtually no lacing is left on the glass, either. Good raosted malt aromas are coupled with strong fruitiness. Black raspberry coupled with fresh grape jelly. The taste is also dark and fruity with a very solid malt component. Mild bitterness leads to a smooth finish with a hint of anise in the aftertaste. A very nice beer."
"The mouthfeel is immature but, Hey, it's only a month old. I've had Mendocino Black Hawk Stout which has been as aggressively carbonated as this has and even though it's a little distracting it's good to do. Aging will balance it but drinking it fresh is extreme in its composition. I like the concept of overcarbonation since it's so ephemeral. Drink this beer now and continue to do so for a long time. I'm off for more tomorrow."
"Dark black color. Small white foamy head. Aroma is dark fruit, bready, yeasty, sweet and spicy. A medium to full bodied Belgian Strong Ale. Malts are dark, fruity and sweet. Yeasts are spicy and bright. Like many of Unibroue beers. Also typical is the complex blend of flavors. The fruits, spices and chocolate flavors all compete and blend into a complex mélange of tastes that mark this as an exceptional beer. Very smooth taste. The only negative point is there is a very definite alcohol bite at 10.5%. Very definite belly warmer. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and dry. Aftertaste is fruity and sweet."
"Another killer beer from Unibroue. Pours an almost black with hinds of a deep red at the edges. Head is full and long lasting. Dark fruit, pepper and yeast dominate the aroma. Taste ranges from sweet and fruity to a crisp bitterness with too many stops in between for me to list. So much to see and do...and a nice ABV. I will be buying more, soon."
"And amongst their finest to date."
"Pours out like chocolate syrup, thick and deathly black. Big one inch head, carbonation releases in pops, lacing in thick webs. Dusty and yeasty aroma, slight candied cherry. Hot cinnamon notes early, flares into the thick maltiness -- which seems mainly constructed of a spiced rum flavor. Finishes with light bittering but plenty of overall body. You can certainly notice alcohol heat and the beer is well put together in the flow of flavor. In some ways this is too big, more showcasing of subtle flavors would offset the alcoholic toxicity better -- as it is, Unibroue does better beers with just slightly less strength, in my opinion."
"Finally got this in good old Ohio with the new law change from last year. This beer poured a very dark, almost black amber color and formed a small off white bubbly head that left trace lace. No light was getting through this one. The aroma was of malt, raisins and chocolate. The flavor was of malt, chocolate and a touch of brandy if you will. The finish was astrigent, yet sweet with a medium body to it. Another fine beer from a great brewery."
"I give it top marks, this is very impressive, well beyond my expectations. The aweful truth is that La Terrible is f-ing fantastique."
"The aroma is good, I smell rum, raisin and dark malt. This is a very light bodied beer, a great example of the light bodied Belgian beer style that will sneak up on you if you are not careful. The beer is pretty dry but there is a bit of sweetness that adds to the complexity of this brew. There is a hint of chocolate malt, a raisin flavor, and it finishes with a bit of alcohol. A light, tasty, easily quaffable beer, which is a dangerous combination."
"Originally reviewed 16 December 2002. I am writing this review from my notes. This pours a dark brown w/ a grey head. roasty flavors w/ some hints of dried fruit greet you . it has a sweet finish. you can definitely taste the alcohol in this one, which is something I don't like. the alcohol should be hidden"
"Cheers!"
"The Chimay Grande Reserve (blue label) has long been the accepted standard of this style. This destroys Chimay. I never really liked the Grande Reserve - I respected its complexity, its flavour, but this has the edge that the Chimay brew lacked. Damn bloody tasty - for now (I have no access to Westy) this will serve as king of the dark Belgians."
"The flavour is rich and clean, again with a lot of the dried fruit flavours coming through. There are some bright notes to lighten things up, blackberries, spices. It really complements the body, which is full and rich without being thick. It's a very cozy and warming beer. I'm really enjoying this one, even if this 750ml, 10% monster will finish me off tonight..."
"""Terrible"" is another exceptional offering from Unibroue that is very drinkable and a great brew to relax with. It's a multi-purpose beer that works well as an afternoon sipping drink, a hearty addition to a meal, or as a replacement to coffee after a meal with friends or family."
"Drinkablilty: I loved this beer. Complex and ever changing in my mouth. What i would consider a perfect after dinner drink or even an adequate night cap. Excellent. A world class brew."
