"Way too boozy for my taste"
"Pretty good.   Would get a six pack but probably not a case."
""
""
""
"Great smell and feel. Not as ""Stouty"" as I would like. Does have a tart linger at the end. Overall a good beer though. The whole barrel room 3 pack is worth a grab."
""
"Overall: felt like an experimental mix, a good one nevertheless. But if I need a strong dark ale, I would prefer a traditional one."
""

"I got this at Costco in a 3-pack with two other Sam Adams BA beers.  Poured from 750ml bottle into small tulip.  A semi-translucent dark brown with small quickly-dissipating off-white head that leaves minimal lace.  Smell is of dark fruits, candy and cherry vinegar.  Taste is like a combination of Belgian dark ale and Flanders red and would be really excellent except for a slight mineral after taste that makes me think the beer is old or otherwise flawed.  Mouth is somewhat thin and fizzy but otherwise seems refreshing although seems to depart from style.  Overall, I would have scored this pretty high if it weren't for the mineral after-taste.  It's a confusing beer being that the label mentions ""Belgian style stout", but it's really more of a dark ale as there is no roastiness to speak of."

"Much better than I had expected"

"750 ml bottle into tulip glass, 2012 vintage bottling. Pours clear nearly opaque dark brown/black color with a 2 finger dense khaki head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of big raisin, plum, cherry, fig, chocolate, cocoa, toast, dark bread, molasses, light coffee, pepper, oak, herbal, light funk, and yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of fruity yeast, dark/roasted malt, and light-moderate oak barrel notes; with good strength. Taste of big raisin, plum, cherry, fig, chocolate, cocoa, toast, dark bread, molasses, light coffee, pepper, oak, herbal, light funk, and yeast earthiness. Light fruity tartness/yeast spice on the finish; with lingering notes of raisin, plum, cherry, fig, chocolate, cocoa, toast, dark bread, molasses, pepper, oak, herbal, light funk, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice complexity and robustness of dark/roasted malt, fruity yeast, and light-moderate oak barrel flavors; with a great malt/yeast balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a very smooth, fairly creamy/bready, and slightly acidic mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice Belgian strong dark ale. All around great complexity, robustness, and balance of fruity yeast, dark/roasted malt, and light-moderate oak barrel flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the ABV. A very enjoyable offering."
""
"Very interesting mix of dark fruits, spice,  chocolate, and roast.  Not sure why it is getting crushed, maybe because it is Sam Adams.  Not world class but high quality."
"Great beer, just not my cup of tea"
""
""
""
"D/O  Drinkability is not high.  I will probably only have one pint out of this bottle which is nearly two pints.  Overall this is a disappointment.  2.5"
""
"Overall, I don't think there is any reason to specifically seek this beer out, but it's not a bad find from my trip to the Sam Adams Brewery."
""
""
"Found this to be quite disappointing. I really wish more flavors came through. It had a strong taste of alcohol like it which I do like, but overall I just found it a tad less then middling. It wasn't that interesting and I didn't think the combination of chocolate, fruitiness and strong alcohol worked too well."
"Less KMF than the stony brook red but still good"
"Pretty good. Tastes like a Flanders red mixed with porter. Fruity, sour ( the good kind ) and a little chocolate aftertaste."
""
""
""
"Was disappointed with doesn't have a full body taste like most other Bourbon barrel stouts ."
""
""
"Given the choices one has at the beer store...I wouldn't buy it for myself."
"Had an unpleasant wine-like aftertaste.  Bottle was unable to be recalled, which is probably a positive, considering it comes in large bottles."
"Beautiful beer. Head made of small bubbles, dark body with hints of ruby. Oak, alcohol and dark fruit in the nose. Cherry and chocolate in the taste. A little thin and a little pricey."
""
"Pours a black color.  1/3 inch head of a tan color.  Great retention and great lacing.  Smells of oak, spices, alcohol, sweet malt, roasted malt, slight grapes, and a hint of hop.  Fits the style of a Belgian Strong Dark Ale.  Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level.  Tastes of sweet malt, spices, slight alcohol, slight roasted malt, slight oak, hint of grape, and slight hops.  Overall, good appearance, aroma, complexity, body, and blend."
""
""
""
"Dark black in color with no penetration to light.  Over an inch thick tightly knit beige head.  Notes of molasses and dark candy sugar reveal themselves in the nose.  I taste far Belgian candy sugar and sweet dark malt.  The mouth is heavily carbonated and creamy."
""
""
"Too thin and comes off confused."
""
"Beer seems to be all over the place with the fruit profile.  I liked this beer, but would not go out of my way to get it again.  Lacks depth of other stouts by SA, some of which are excellent."
""
""
""
"Overall eh  wouldn't recommend it not bad but plenty of stuff out there that's better including many form Sam Adams."
""
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel: pretty thin, almost like a weakly carbonated Belgian tripel than a stout. Not terrible, but neither a good imperial stout nor Belgian tripel. For the price, its not a good purchase. I would not buy this again."
""
"It's quite complex, and yet outwardly it seems fairly simple, with the subtle nuances making it even more interesting than if it just had fuller, more vivid attributes. I couldn't put it down because of that, and yet I could easily see not being able to put it down just because it's so readily drinkable at the same time."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Cherries on the nose. Chocolatey taste to the head. Sour, spicy and fruity up front. Mildly bitter finish. Very nice but different from a typical stout. Might have enjoyed it a little more if I had refrigerated it first."
""
""
"Remarks:  interesting overall, but not something I'd seek out again.  Probably go well with, you guessed it, a reuben."

"This beer turned me on the the Dark Ales with good fruit notes to it.  NIce chocolate aroma and taste as well.  SA def blends a lot of different spices (13) to make one great experience.   Love it!"

"O - the taste is great, for SA I was actually surprised they could put something out this good. Is a little rough around the edges, a little too hot for 9% and somewhat tannic/astringent. Looks great though and aroma was so enticing albeit a little boozy, ill drink it again."
""
"O - Yummy but underwhelming."
""
""
"Thirteenth Hour pours an almost black color with a nice long lasting lacing head. There is a very sweet aroma; lots of date notes, some oak. The taste has big oak flavors, big sweet spices, lots of dry fruits. Very complex, but nice body, a little watery. Overall lots of stuff going on here, some nice flavors, and good to sip."
""
""
"Poured from a big-ass bottle (oddly shaped, bomber-sized) into my snifter glass. Deep, opaque brown with tinges of deep red around the base when held to the light. 1/2 finger of tan head which quickly faded. Aromas of oak and molasses. The flavors were very reminiscent of a trippel with hints of molasses, banana, some dark fruit (raisins?), some alcohol (expected at 9%). This had a rich mouthfeel, but again, not what I was expecting for a stout. Overall, this drank like a trippel, albeit a dark appearing trippel... not quite sure what SA's definition of a 'Belgian' stout is, but be aware that this did not drink like a stout. However, it was a pretty nicely balanced beer overall, which improved as the glass warmed."

"Overall – While listed as an Imperial Stout, I would definitely not classify it as that, but instead as a Belgian strong dark ale. It is fruitier and less roasty with a whole mess of Belgian yeast flavors. Overall it is alright, but really does not outshine other beers of a comparable style and price."
"Poured from a corked 750 ml bottle into a Liefmans Goudenband glass (my preferred all purpose beer tasting glass). Purchased at Costco as part of a three bottle combo pack early January 2014."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Taste is definitely more on the belgian side, with a hint of oak and wood alongside a touch of heat. Very subtle and complex, but most certainly a sipper."
""
""
""
""
"Pours dark brown, almost black, with thick creamy inch head that sits atop like whipped cream. Woodsy nose with raisins. Slight bourbon nose too. Whisky oak taste, boozy, but thin for a stout. Coffee, maple, plums, all kinds of flavors intertwined. Hearty carbonation. Borders on barleywine. Robust."

"Poured from a 1PT 9.4 oz bottle into a stemmed glass showed a very beautiful dark reddish brown brew with a creamy tan head about 2"" high, nice lacing hangs on as you enjoy this beer. The aroma is that of a Dark Strong Belgian Ale..a nice series of spicy notes hit the nose along with a alcohol up front cover...picked up a slight hint of chocolate and some oak from the barrels. The taste was straight Belgian Strong Ale with some nice spice, dark fruits and maybe a bitter coffee near the end. Mouthfeel is medium and right on spot, the flavors hang around on the tongue and gives a great aftertaste of spicy dark ale. Aside from being labeled A DARK BELGIAN STYLE STOUT it's listed on BA as a Belgian Strong Dark Ale...which is exactly what it tastes like, at 9% ABV it comes in where it should. This is a well made brew with a good solid flavor and would be great to share or use for a special occasion....as I did..good job and I enjoyed it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Sour. And not in a good way. For me the combination of Belgian sour-style with the coffee notes of a stout just did not work. The sour flavor overwhelmed the characteristics of a stout, and allowed little of the other ingredients to reveal themselves. I was disappointed & found this beer off-putting"

"The 13th Hour Stout was a mixture between a sour, stout and maybe a BSDA. It poured a dark brown color with 4 finger foam head with tiny carbonation bubbles. The head dissipated quickly and settled into a tiny 1 mm head. The smell was brown sugar, anise and sour green apples. The mouthfeel was thin and left a semi sour mark on the palate. Overall an interesting beer but seemed to be a little off."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Okay this may be one of the most original beers I have ever had. I will however say it is not a stout... Nor is it a BSDA. I don't know what it is, but I will say the sour from the Brett really comes through. I can't say I would recommend this beer, but I certainly did enjoy the adventure that was tasting it."
""
""
""
"O: Not the best body, but a damn good Belgian style stout."
"Drinkability is solid overall. Definitely a nice beer, very good, not great. I seem to like it more than most here I guess, but I love a fruity BSDA. Some heat though, it's a sipper, but a very nice one."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Too many conflicting elements mar this beer; to call it a BSDA here is as much a misnomer as the label calling it a Belgian stout; it is a kitchen sink beer but I would say that the experiment failed"
""
""
"O - I'm torn. The fact is, I was looking for a stout, and I got a Belgian dark ale. Now, I like Belgian dark ales, so that is not a bad thing, but there was really nothing particularly stout-like about this experiment. If the base starts there, by the end the other elements dominate. I enjoy the beer, but it really isn't even exceptional as a Belgian, and the barrel aging seems to add little beyond a few alcohol and wood notes."
""
""
""
"While we're on the topic of being mislead, the brewery is free to call Thirteenth Hour a stout - and, to be sure, it started out as one - but it drinks far more like a Belgian Strong Dark Ale. And it's not a particularly good one at that. Indeed, this disappoints on all possible fronts - stout, Belgian dark, barrel-aged and soured beer - unable to satisfy on any of those accounts."
""
""
""
""
""
"Better after a year in the cellar."
"D: This was a nice BSDA, but not much stout character and basically no barrel. The scent and taste were still nice, and the body was decent. The finish was smooth with well hidden alcohol, so it was pretty easy to drink. Might age well. Fresh is good not great."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I guess it does say Belgian in style, but this still is a little off from the stout classification. Spice and herbal roots play the major roles here, not dark malt or its oak aging. If you look past that it's a good beer, but I was hoping for a thicker beer with darker flavors."
""
"O: This is a great special occasion brew that has a lot to offer. There's so much going on in this brew it's hard to describe. This is a good example of what a unique yeast blend can bring to a brew. Having said that, I can't see myself drinking this but on very special occasions, once a year at best. But I think that is there intention. If you can get it, it's worth the price in my opinion."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a nice treat and a credit to the style and the brewer."
""
""
""
""
""
"This beer is really hard to drink. The clashing flavors are a bit too much. A stout should be a stout and a Belgian a Belgian. Smell is offputting and the taste is way too funky. Reminds me of those chocolate oranges, which i was never a fan of. Mouthfeel is oily and slick. Lucky there's no lingering aftertaste, so as difficult as it might be to finish the glass, at least it won't linger."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The Worcestershire sauce aroma and taste worries me as soy sauce flavor means a yeast issue and perhaps just a bad bottle. That flavor was light and the overall experience was better than average."
"O: I could drink a glass of this, but would have no interest in having it again. I've had Belgian dark ales before, but none so tart as this."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This beer is very smooth with a remarkable carbonation level. I certainly taste the distinctive belgian yeast with hints of cloves and possible banana notes. The 9% ABV is really well hidden as this beer is surprisingly easy to drink, I was expecting more of a sipper type brew."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Why did it take me so long to try this? One of Sam Adams better beers in this series despite not really having a lot of oaking. This tastes like a complex quad. A sipper I will get again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Really good beer. I don't know why this doesn't get more love. I remember it being a little hot when I had it fresh and I think I also thought it was just ""pretty good"" and not ""great"". I will definitely pick up another to cellar, especially with the nice price tag."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Stout this is not, unlike Sam Adams claims. This is more of a BSDA, which is not a bad this. Sam Adams makes a Belgian style beer with firm American tones here. Big, boozy and bold, this is a good brew, but relies too much on big flavors, making it almost overwhelming. Don’t get me wrong, this is a nice beer, but if you want real high-quality American BSDA, you can do much better."
""
""
""
""
""

""
""
"overly sweet all into one."
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured into a pint glass."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Not bad overall. I was hoping for more stout qualities. A little too sweet. I think this could have used some anise to make this a little more balanced and complex. I would pick up any other Belgian strong dark ale before revisiting this but if you can't get anything else its at least worth the try"
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Displays a staunch fruitiness with a bit more sweetness than desired, I'd prefer a touch less sweetness and still a hair more carbonation."
""
""
""
"O - Not a bad flavor just not what I was expecting, tried to pawn it off on my wife since she is the wine drinker and she enjoyed it, which isn't normal for her to like specialty beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This beer is exceptional and had I not known better, I'd guess this to be a real Belgian. At 9% ABV, it's more a sipper, but it's so good and easy to drink that I really went after this one. It's really a great beer than a fan of Belgians will appreciate."
""
""
"jd"
""
"sam Adams keeps trying to compete with the micros but they don't seem to quite get it. This would have been a really great beer if they had left the crappy spices out of the mix. It had undertoes of a stout and notes choc which would have been OK if not for the lacing of what ever spices they used to ruin the mix. They need to get different taste testers b/4 they go to market w/ a new beer."
"Drinkability: It's a very smooth drinkable beer accompanied with good flavors and aromas."
""
""
""
"All in all, a pretty good and unique dark Belgian style ale, much fruitier than I expected, and potentially a bit cloying. Strength makes it a sipper and the big bottle means you'll probably want to split it; even disregarding the strength, its going to be a bit rich for downing in one sitting on your own for most. Still, despite these quirks, worth trying and I'm enjoying it."
""
""
"Serving type: bottle"
""
""
""
"Bought at the brewery just a few days ago and shared with me: thanks LJ."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overal: This beer seems a bit unbalanced. It is a bit too carbonated and the taste of alcohol dwarfs the nuance of the overall experience. I would recommend a pint rather than a full bottle."
""
"Hard for me to judge this one, as it's not one of my favorite styles. Overall a good beer, could use a little more body."
""
""
"An interesting mix of flavors. The aroma is very inviting. It's a mix of sweet and acidic fruit. The oak is very subtle and stays in the background, almost unnoticeable."
""
"O: So super surprised here. I was expecting something like, ""dark truth"" from boulevard. What I got was a surprising mix of a Belgian strong and a Flanders red. I was absolutely surprised and quite pleasantly. This is a great beer if you dig the ""sour"" flavor profiles, if not, stay away. For me, this is a no brainer. I already bought 5 bottles. Hopefully one will make it till next year."
""
""
"Overall- This is not what I expected. It is more like a sour ale than a stout, but it is still very interesting and enjoyable."
"One shade lighter than black with some reddish highlights when held up to a light, the head is pretty rocky with a mix of medium and fine bubbles. Smell is of dark fruit, dark roasted malts, a bit of funky yeast character and some coffee. The taste has a lot of the dark fruit and malt but I'm also getting this funky or vinous thing as well. Not much alcohol and no wood character in their either. The bitterness is very low to nonexistent as this beer remains quite sweet and syrupy throughout. There is a bit of a pepper tingle in the mouthfeel combined with medium to low levels of carbonation the finish is sweet and then dry, rather unusual actually. Overall this is a bit of a miss to me. I'm just not getting enough of the classic belgian yeast character that I would expect for a beer of this style, it is missing the wood that should be notable in a barrel aged beer and the funky flavor is a bit strange."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"All in all, this is a respectable attempt at a rather unique style of beer. If it were available in smaller format bottles, I might consider buying it again."
""
"Overall I'd give it a solid 4, and well worth buying again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This is a solid brew. The depth of this makes it extremely tasty and interesting. I'm glad I picked this up to try. As I said earlier in this review, this may be the deepest brew from Sam Adams. I really like this one and I can see myself buying the rest of these Sam Adams barrell room collection beers. Great job, guys!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Maybe medium body, carbonation is just a tick on the higher side. A very faint warming. Drinks pretty well, just a bit thin, like most dark style Belgians in my opinion."
""
"This was enjoyed with light conversation and sharp cheddar cheese."
""
""
""
"Overall: The beer is a dessert in itself. I think it would manage with a little less alcohol and carbonation, but I can see that Sam Adams wanted to go all out. It's a special oak aged beer, but I don't detect much oak in it, nor coffee (which they mention in their own tasting notes). A tasty and rich beer, I'd recommend sharing the big bottle (I don't one if it's available in anything else except the 1pt 9.4 fl oz bottle) with someone though!"
""
""
""
"O: a very complex and interesting beer. I'm not too sure what to make of it. At first it was overwhelming but it opened up quite nicely. Sam Adams describes it as a belgian style stout which it fits much better than a belgian strong dark"
"O: Not terrible. My biggest complaint is too much carbonation (personal preference). Probably would not buy again. Havent sampled many of the ""sour"" beers, which this is supposed to be(ish) (The tag says it is blended with ""Cosmic Mother Funk"") to be able to give a good judge of how accurate a representation it is of the style."
""
""
""
"O - Pair this with some dry cheeses. I had some aged manchego and it enhanced the experience. This was a nice beer but there are better examples of the style."
"Not a bad beer, but falls short based on my expectations after reading the label."
""
""
""
"found these sam adams barrel aged beers and i was excited. i have like sam adams' specialty beers whenever i had tried them, so i was interested to try these barrel aged ones. this beer pours a dark cloudy golden brown- looks black but if you hold it to the light you can see accents of gold. the tan head grows steady after pouring, until it was thick. the smell is dark and fruity, with maybe a slight smoke. the taste reminds me of a sweet sherry. the dark fruity notes are bold in the flavor. the bitterness is even across the whole pallet, not just coming at the end- which for some reason makes this beer seem pretty mild and fairly drinkable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The taste is a step up from the aroma with a slightly more forward malt and yeast character but the oak and dark fruits tend to supersede it. Low to moderate bitterness at the end that does not last."
""
""
"Compared to other dark beers, say Sublimely Self Righteous Ale, this isn't the balls to the wall flavorfest, but a more subtle yet equally complex flavor combination. It is comprised of a collection of fruit notes over a well rounded stout background. Vs the other brew I mentioned, the hop tones are more subtle, which is very likely the primary difference and it provides what could be considered an overall more drinkable beer. A very very enjoyable brew."
"Didn't wow me. Not enough going on to go out of the way for."
""
""
"I thought this beer was fairly average. Just not really digging how sour it was. I probably won't drink this again."
""
""
""
""

""
""
""

""
""
"O- Overall, I really enjoyed the Thirteenth Hour. It was a great new beer from Sam Adams."
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured into a snifter, it’s almost pitch black at first sight, but as you hold it up to the light, beautiful dark reds and amber colors shine through. The head is thick, dense and very creamy, very active with popping bubbles and it’s all very tempting… and it sticks around for quite some time too, making a great companion as you drink this beer. Lots of dark fruits in the aroma, raisins, figs, grapes, mild apple, slight roasted malts and spices are all present. The flavor is just as pleasing, malts are more present and the spices take the backstage in this part. Its slightly bitter overall and the sweetness comes out as you swallow. The spices are also more evident in its aftertaste, the alcohol is well hidden. This is one smooth beer and a great tasting one at that too."
""
"You would be hard pressed to find a more delectable and well-balanced ""bigger beer"" than this one."
"O: not bad at all. Not my favorite, but not bad. I paid $10.99 for this beer, which was way too much, but...you only live once. For that price, and from SA, I expected a little more."
""
"Subtle and interesting flavor but metallic notes persist and linger. Ultimately, an okay but rather boring beer with no outstanding qualities and a few problems that would be okay to share small pours with a few people. Otherwise, I wouldn't bother."
"Overall this made for an interesting experience. It wasn't bad, but t doesn't rise to the point of being a ""must find"" beer."
""
""
"This pours a dark brown color with a light brown, foamy head that leaves behind some decent lacing. Aroma is yeast, malts, some cocoa, and sweetness. There is a lesser robust taste than expected with a decent amount of spices mixed with sweet malts. The texture is very Belgian indeed. Probably the most interesting of the Barrel Room Collection brews."
""
""
""
""
""
"D- Quite enjoyable, probably one of my favorites of the ""barrel series."""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - had high expectations, but they were not met. just not indicative of the genre, IMO."
"Overall, I really was expecting more stout characteristics with this beer. This screams Flanders red or Oud Brun more than Belgian ale. It is all just a bit rough around the edges and a bit weak."
""
"O: A very nice beer. Smooth, a touch of sweetness, and chocolate make this beer very drinkable. Barrel aging could have been extended to help mellow out the booze. I would definitely buy this beer again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"When poured the color was a very, very dark brown with medium tight tan foam with very little if any lace on the side of the glass. The smell of roasted malts, caramel, candy spice with a hint of chocolate and coffee. The flavor that came across the palate was of spice, bitter/sweet chocolate and a hint of raisin. On the palate there was a sweet/bitterness of all the flavor component in this complex stout."
""
""
""
"3.5 D: Overall good effort. It was a little pricey though, so I doubt I'd buy it again. No faults and solid all around."
"I found this beer pretty enjoyable. Good mouth feel with not a strong alcohol undertone. A pretty good offering overall."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

""
"I will have to find this again to get another taste but also age it to develop the flavors."
""
"This is a phenomenal beer. People dissing on it either were unaware of what they were getting or had their heart set on one beer over another. Sam Adams claims that there are not to many Belgian stouts...well that is true but they do exist but none of them are like this. Most have that fruity like flavor but not this dry. Not this sour. I have has sour stouts and this is the best. New Belgiums for example was good but not sour enough. Fort George out of Astoria, Oregon was too sour. Other brewers in the USA interested in Belgian stouts have made very good versions, but this is on a totally different level. Could this improve? Yes. They could find a way to get the stout like flavors to be a bit more forward. Maybe not so dry but in its age at the moment, there is not bottling date provided (they need to start doing this), this is superb. Get this if you see it. Drink it fresh or age it...will I get this again. Yup and I will be pushing all my friends to give it a go."
""
"D - Sweet and fruity, but relatively well balanced. It has just enough dark chocolate and spice to balance and make a very drinkable example of the style."
"Overall: very belgian, not very stout-y. Not a bad beer. This is much more like a belgian dark strong as listed."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Not a thrilling offering from Sam Adams, but perfectly drinkable. Does improve as it warms during the drink."

"Pours into a tulip glass a deep chocolate brown with ruby highlights,a creamy one finger light tan colored head atop.Aromas were a little light with some roast, molasses and fruity yeast esters.A little sharper than expected in the mouth,a lighter feel for the style.Not as roasted on the palate as the nose suggests,black licorice is big along with dark fruit and more yeasty fruitiness.Not bad but not worth the price tag in my opinion,still it's nice to see the Barrel Room Collection here in NC now."

"O: Rather disappointed in this one. I wouldn't get it again."
""
""
"A nice belgian-style stout. Doesn't knock my favorites off the mantle, but a decent excursion on the Stout journey."
""
"This is NOT your normal stout. This beer tries to combine some of the qualities of a Belgian and a Stout, but in my opinion falls a little short. Not a bad beer by any stretch, but I expect a bit more out o special runs from Samuel Adams."
"O – I would not recommend this beer. If it was offered to me I might drink it, but I definitely wouldn’t buy it again. It has some positive elements to it, but the flavors clash more than they build upon one another."
""
""
"Pours a clear dark brown with a foamy khaki head that settles to a small cap on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, dark fruits, and some cocoa aromas. Taste is much the same with a slight tartness in the flavor. There is a mild roasty bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer but I think it tastes better than it smells."

"The Thirteenth Hour is a fairly typical Belgian-style strong dark ale that's made by a U.S. brewery with U.S. ingredients and techniques. These usually result in a sticky sweet taste with simple fruit and simple spice with little of the rustic intangibles that make authentic versions so great. A higher wood aged presence would have given a much needed complexity to make me forget about the one-dimensional sweet taste."
""
"Final Thoughts: A good beer from a hit and miss brewery. Would I drink it again? I wouldn't turn it down but I wouldn't seek it out. I will be looking for other bombers in this series from Samuel Adams."

"O - An interesting beer to say the least. Samuel Adams hit-and-miss tendencies made me less than exuberant about putting down 12 dollars for a bottle, but I like to think I made a good choice. Very tasteful, very well-made, very rich. This beer is intense and warming. Great winter time early morning taster (but only if you've got the day to yourself, lots of alcohol here)"
""
""
""
""
""
"O= This is a unique beer. I went into it thinking imperial stout with a belgian twist but that's far from what it actually is. This is a funky belgian dark. Not bad but this is a decent beer and worth checking out."
"Pretty impressive outing from Sam Adams. This beer may look intimidating, but it was actually quite sweet on the tongue and the alcohol was hidden aside from the typical warming sensation it provided."
"Since the bottle noted it was a ""stout," I was expecting a thicker texture and this one is on the thin side overall. But, this is definitely a complex and tasty brew that I would gladly recommend."
"Brown pour but black in the glass. Small tan head, no lace. Sour cherries, Belgian yeast, hint of coffee grounds, and faint roast in the aroma. Just a bit of oak comes off as it warms. The flavor has sweet, tart cherries and yeast, with a bit of toasty malts.Alcohol and the slightest bit of oak on the finish. Medium body at best, with light carbonation"

"	Overall Impression: this is a very good beer; it's smooth, big, and drinkable; I have never even heard of anything like this...a spicy stout is just crazy, but in a good way; there are layers of flavor throughout and they get a bit more pronounced as it warms up; may favorite part is the balance of the malty and spicy flavors...it's a spicy stout! that's just nuts!"
"O - This was an ambitious beer that hit most of the right notes. I'd definitely drink it again if I get the opportunity, but it's not something that I'm going to be seeking out."

"O: A nearly perfect example of the style (Belgian Stout/Strong Dark) and a very respectable Sam Adams offering."
"O: An interesting and overall enjoyable brew. I would prefer a bit more malt & less sour, but this was still nice."
"Rich and more of a dessert drink, but another intriguing and well-made beer from Sam Adams. From the 750 ml bottle bought at Liticker's in San Diego."
"The Belgian stout is a weird style on its own, and Thirteenth Hour is a fine example of how these flavors play off one another. Pick one up if you want an interesting taste experience -- or if you're a Neanderthal like me and just want a pretty bottle to look at."

"Pours with a thick, foamy head that sticks around for ages. This beer is black as coal with some reddish tint around the edges. Aromas of chocolate and berry with wood and bread hints. Has a wonderful spiced coffee and fruit juice flavor with notes of chocolate and leaves. Body is creamy without being too thick or syrupy. This is a really well done stout."
"O - Awesome beer from Sam Adams. I really dig the mouth fee. Its extremely smooth. The taste and smell is a little mono tone but pleasant and solid all and all. I can see myself purchasing this again. If you haven't tried it got for it. The money could be spent on worse beer.."
"In the end, I'm left with a mysteriously complex beer that has the nose of a really nice example of one style, and the flavor of a really nice example of another style, and I'm perfectly fine with that. Purists beware. This is the beer that prompted me to start seeking out other bottles of the Sam Adams Barrel Room collection for trying out, and I don't regret that decision at all. It's too bad I could only get one bottle, as it would have been interesting to see if cellaring would amplify some tart pucker into the flavor."

"I wasn't sure that I would like a soured stout, but this is amazing. The mouthfeel is decadent and unlike any other beer I've had. The combination of sweet, sour, malty, and dark fruit is amazing. I would gladly buy this in bulk, but it's all sold out locally. I consider myself fortunate to have had it though. Highly recommended."

"Drinkability is great on this stout. A ton of great tastes and with a good amount of carbonation makes this a really drinkable stout that you could drink for a long time. Also, because of all the unique and interesting tastes, this is a beer that you would want to drink a lot of on a fall day when winter is creeping in. Find a way to get your hands on this beer and try it!"

"If the legend about Triple Bock is correct, then this beer is still a few notches above it. I would prefer more body and more prominent flavors all-around. Good try but I wouldn't buy it again."

"The cork came off with a loud pop and lots of smoke emerged from the bottle. Poured into a large brandy snifter. Pours dark brown with a tan head. The head does not hang around, leaving a ring of lacing on the side of the glass. The aroma of this beer is spicy with those coffee and chocolate notes. There's some dark fruits (plum and prune) in the smell as well as some alcohol. There's also some of that oak with some vanilla. But those chocolate notes from the malts are dominant in the nose. There is some tartness as well. If you took a Belgian strong dark ale and married it with a stout, this is the sort of beer you'd get. It has those familiar Belgian dark ale flavors with the spice and dark fruits. You get that oakiness from the barrels. Those stout flavors come through well too. I get that chocolate from the malt as well as those coffee notes. I get some of the alcohol, but it doesn't overpower. The tartness also comes through in the taste. The beer is smooth with a slightly dry finish. The drinkability is high. This is an excellent beer."

""
"Mouthfeel: This is a very creamy and medium bodied stout that doesn’t have much of a bitterness to it that makes of one of the easiest drinking stouts that come to mind."
"OVERALL: A successful brew from Samuel Adams. Lots of good flavors going on, and mostly do compliment each other. Barrel aging has added a nice touch to this beer, and it is drinking just fine right now. Would pair nicely with chocolates."
"Overall, hoping for a lot more at this price point."
""
"Hint of fruitiness (apple). Coffee and stout flavors in the toasted malt. Sour/tart apple. I don't like the blend of stout/Belgian in Thirteenth Hour nearly as well as Mikeller's Santa's Little Helper, which I tasted the same day. This one clashes with itself."
""

"O - Kind of an odd duck, this one. First of all it's NOT a stout by any means; it's a Belgian DA. And while it excels in spots, it falls flat in others. Would I drink it again? A definite maybe. Glad I sampled it in any case."
""

"O: Decent, just not exciting. Glad I tried it, but not much bang for the bucks."

"Overall - So far I am really impressed by these specialty beers, hopefully the last one will be the best for last"

"Overall: A nice twist to the style. I have had the bottle for a year now and happy to see it has settled and aged well. I have another bottle and will age that one a bit longer."

"An okay crack at the style at best, will probably do better some age on it. It is a little too dry & oaky to me, a little too hot still"

"This is a very complex beer. I'm not sure I can even capture all of the complexities. The malt is smooth and balanced. The yeast adds some complementary fruity notes. The oak was harder for me to detect. Overall, though, it's complex, delicious, and definitely worth a try."

"O: I was hoping for stronger stout characteristics, but overall this was a good beer."
"Overall: highly recommended for anyone that enjoys dark beers. It suffers very slightly from poorly hidden alcohol, but that doesn't detract from the beer enough to damage the experience. This is a beer I could happily sit and drink in front of a warm fireplace during a snowstorm."
""
""
"Overall I really was surprised and enjoyed this beer from Sam Adams. The flavors are well blended and this is exactly what a Belgian Stout should taste like. I was saving this for colder weather but just decided to crack it open on a whim and although the darker beers are better enjoyed in colder months in my opinion, the dark fruitiness and lighter body make it fine for any evening as a nightcap."
"Overall - A dark Belgian style ale with hints of a more traditional stout profile. It's not really a beer for me (though I tried to be fair in rating what it was), as I'd rather have just a strong dark ale or just a stout, but the unique character is worth the try."
""
""
""
"Atmosphere is pretty good. Nice hue, head, and fair lacing. Nose is great combo of malt and dark chocolate, with a synthetic sweetness. Flavor is of malt, caramel, and sweet notes. Overall, this is a really good quaff."
""
"750 ml caged and corked bottle. Served in a chalice, the beer pours a dark ruby red/brown color (when held to the light) with about an inch tan head. Head retention and lacing are both good. The aroma is nice, it smells like dark fruit, chocolate, sweet spices, vanilla, and some coffee. It tastes like dark fruit (cherries, raisins, plums), chocolate, sweet spices, oak, tart fruit and a little bit of coffee. However, it is a mostly sweet tasting beer. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit creamy and coating with good carbonation. I think this is a good overall brew, I'd buy it again. It was better than I was expecting it to be so it was a nice surprise! I'm pretty sure it was just $6.99 a bottle, I don't think it was any more than that."
"Very nice brew!"
"Poured into a Maudite snifter. Pours a very dark ruddy brown, appearing black in the glass. Healthy three finger light brown head with great retention and massive lacing. Aroma dominated by light fruit, particularly cherries and Belgian yeast and spicing. Light element of toasted malt; kind of the opposite I'd expect from a stout (as per the lable), but appropriate for the style listed here on BA. Pleasant, but surprising. Flavor is also confusing, starting with sweet light fruit juice, developing into slightly sour cherry, finishing with pleasant light and dark fruit with slight Belgian yeast and spicing. I'm not picking up much wild yeast funk nor much if any toasted malt. Not detecting the chocolate nor oak, maybe a hint of each. I'm uncertain how to review this; if by the lable, it is a somewhat of a miss. A stout with no toasted or dark malt flavor does not seem in style. Since it is pleasant to drink, I'm going to score it under the BA style of Belgian strong dark ale. Flavor is overall light, but nicely balanced and an interesting flavor progression. Body is medium with a bit of creaminess; nice mouth feel. A reasonable domestic take on a BSDA. Alcohol is well covered by the flavor. I recommend this ale, but don't grab one expecting a traditional (or even Belgian style) stout. The BA strong Belgian ale style is spot on. I like this and will probably buy it again."

"Not the oil spill of a barrel aged stout that I'm used to but lots of interesting flavors. A beer to ponder."
"Poured from a 750 MLS bottle into a tulip glass, no bottled date. This pours a dark brown, almost back color with a massive head. The smells are very strongly of Belgian yeast esters, coco, alcohol, and sweet malts. The feel is medium. The taste is a little different full of malty Belgian strong ale malts, but with weird roasted malts."
""
"O- This is a pretty good offering, but nothing really blows me away. Definitely fits more into the Belgian dark ale category than a stout."
"Pours out a deep brown with plum highlights. The head is large, and reduces to a centimeter of cap. The aroma is very enticing, it's got a nice sour fruit aroma, along with Belgian yeasts, chocolate, and coffee. The taste is also excellent, this is a well-composed beer with layers and layers of flavor. Keeping that in mind, it's also smartly subdued, making picking out the layers of flavor a joy. It comes on with sour tart fruit, chocolate, and yeast. Sips invite in traces of coffee, spice, roasted malt, and oak. A masterful composition. The mouthfeel is lighter and well-carbonated, and the drinkability is good. Overall, this is a superb beer. It's just a joy to sip, it's got a lot of flavor dimensions without being taxing. I can't help but feel some of the middling reviews have more to do with the name on the bottle than the product in it."
"O: A classic ""all 4's"" kind of beer. It's great, but with a few tweaks here and there, it would become incredible. I couldn't have a lot of this (I pretty much had about 10 oz and corked the rest up), but it's a nice after dinner conversation piece. Great to see Sam Adams coming out of its comfort zone with a beer like this."
"O-didn't know what to expect with this one, but I'm definitely pleased. It definitely drinks like a good dark Belgian ale. It doesn't taste artificial like many American Belgian styles. This is awesome."
"Not worth the price tag."
"Overall: Not a huge fan of stouts personally, but I will give credit were due, it is a very well crafted beer, I did enjoy the whole bottle, but probably won't buy again, just cause as I said before, these darker heavier stouts and ales are not my style."

"O - This is an interesting beer. Dark, stoutish, but with the fruit esters of a Belgian Ale. I'm not sure if the offbeat Sam Adam's ""Belgian Stout"" monikers fits best or if the BA ""Belgian Strong Dark Ale"" suits it better. Either way, it is worth checking out."
"It's alright but I prefer their every day Imperial Stout to this one. It has better body and is less fruity."
""

""

"The darker malts appear in the taste but not nearly as strong as an English Porter or an Irish Stout. Really closer to a dark ale on the malt side. The sour flavor shows up in the swallow, but it doesn't last long. I note some vanilla (from the oak?) and stone fruit as well. The body is pretty typical for the style."
"D - Sam Adams does well on this one. It is an exciting beer with clean, exceptional flavors. Worth seeking out, worth drinking, maybe even worth drinking a second time (if I can recall what I paid for the fifth)."
""
""
"Another interesting Barrel Room beer from Sam Adams. This one is a dense black color, with a fizzy brownish head. The smell is all Belgian...lots of funk, yeast, and acids. Horse and grass, some malt, and a little booze. The taste is sugary and malty, with a bit of acidic twang. Funky, yeasty, and intense. The alcohol is well hidden. The body is a little helter-skelter, at once both spritzy and substantial. I didn't get many wood notes in the beer, although there is a myriad of complex flavors. I enjoyed this beer more than I expected."
"O - Decent, but nothing special. Off in what you would expect from a stout and the flavors don't flow well enough together to make up for it. Better options from the Sam Adams line."
"O-Like most Sam Adams it seems to start well but not reach the potential it had. Nose was good but the taste does not live up."
"I had higher hopes for this. I wanted the stout flavors to be much more pronounced. Not awful but not worth buying a second time. Mediocre. "

"O: This was not very pleasant to drink. It seems that it was probably infected."

"Pours a three fingered light brown head that fades slowly to a ring, leaving some lace. Good carbonation and medium bodied. Color is black, no highlights. Spicy chocolate nose and flavor is sweet, spicy chocolate and coffee. Good stout - second only to their Imperial White. $9.99 for a caged and corked, black, 750ml bottle from Market Basket Concord, NH."
"Poured into a goblet, the stout was a healthy back color with a slight quickly fading head. The aroma was a very potent sweet chocolate scent that certainly will draw the interest of many drinkers. In the initial taste, the very sweet chocolate flavor was combined with an equally potent fruit flavor. On the way down, a warming alcohol taste finished the experience. At the same time, the stout stayed sweet in the aftertaste. The stout was a little thinner that I would ahve liked. A thicker stout would have lingered in the mouth longer. By far, this is one of my favorites from Samuel Adams."

"complex flavors, enjoyable in small quantities."

"Grabbed a bottle of this at the brewery a few months ago. This poured out as a nice deep brownish black color with a brown colored head on top. The smell of the beer has some hints of chocolate, coffee and roasted malts. I wasn't able to get much of the barrel aging from the nose on this one though. The taste of the beer is slightly sweet, with a little bit of bitterness from the dark malts, there are some creamy flavors in there and some dry roasted malts also. Again there isn't much from the barrel ageing filling in on the taste either. The mouthfeel of this beer is medium bodied with a smooth silkiness to it. Overall I think this beer is really quite good, I would probably buy it again over the others in the series if I end up at the brewery again."

"(Overall) A pretty good experience and one I don't regret going through. There's plenty of great flavors to be found in this beer. Worth it if you can find it. 4"

"Dark brown pour with a big tan head that isn't going anywhere anytime soon. The smell is fainter than I expected. A bit of breadiness and maybe a tiny bit of fruit. The taste starts off with some candy malt that gives way to dark fruit with a hit of vanilla in the aftertaste. Not a whole lot in the way of balance here, this tastes more like a desert than a beer. Mouthfeel is nice and thick, but the alcohol really starts to punch through as it warms up. This is like some sort of alcoholic fruit tart. Not really what I expected, but not unpleasant."
"O: Overall a bit thin substance wise with a quiet complexity that is perhaps to gentle at times makes this a shoulder shrug from someone who loves Belgian style beers and dark roasty bases. The yeasty quality was one of the few bright points here, the spicing was not up to advertising. Expected so much more from this especially after just sampling their triple (New World) which I found very respectable. Average drinkability and may not be worth the price of admission except for the fancy packaging."
""
"Overall-- I very much enjoyed this one! It's not quite a ""bucolic"" as some Belgian Dark Ales I've enjoyed, but generally this one's an engaging, interesting and flavor laden beer."

"Although it pops like champagne when you open it (watch for flying corks!) it doesn’t fizz like nobody’s business. It pours a deep, warm, opaque sable with a rather typical tan head that doesn’t stick around too long. Smoky aroma has a strong fruity overtone, mainly apple and pear with a hint of banana, and earthy and miso touches. Flavor has a malty core with subtle nutty, earthy, molasses, fruity, roast coffee and chocolate notes. It tastes like a good Belgian style ale blended with a stout, and the different aspects of these two styles marry well. Smooth, edgy texture has above-average body and leaves a nutty, earthy, smoky finish."
""
"All in all, glad to have tried it, but I won't be searching it out again. It's basically like a Belgian Stout / Belgian Dark / Fruit Beer hybrid, but the interplay of characteristics doesn't mesh IMO."
"O- This is probably one of the better beers I've had from Sam Adams and probably one of the smoothest beers I've had. I like beers that have a little bit more of a lingering aftertaste and more pronounced flavor, but other then that it was a great beer. Could've been a little bit sweeter and definitely more flavorful, but other then that it was a very well balanced beer."
"As it warms the flavors become more pronounced, an interesting beer indeed."
"Overall I am disappointed, I was hoping with the name Stout this would be a richer drink but there is no roast, no coffee, no real body to speak of. Much more like a BSDA but is even lacking in that category. Will not be having again."
""
""
"O- The flavors are well blended or perhaps it just doesn't have any depth and it is pretty light aswell. It has none of the flavors described on the bottle and I wouldn't guess this to be a stout if it wasn't printed on the bottle."
""
""
""
"O: This is not a bad beer by any means but it really misses the mark as far as Stouts go, ""Belgian"" or otherwise. Now that I see BA classifies it as a Belgian Strong Dark Ale I feel I can cut it some slack. Definitely tastes like a Belgian Dubbel. Barrel aging is nearly nonexistent; no oak, no vanilla. For 9% it is very easy drinking and nicely warming. It's worth a try but just don't expect a Stout."
""
""
""
"Finishes a bit hollow for me. But isn't bad by any means"
"Medium-bodied, maybe a little on the thin side. Still pretty enjoyable."
""
"O - Not very familiar with the Belgian style here, but this is good not great. Complaints are no real coffee notes and lack of hop balance in my opinion. Enjoyed, but unlikely to purchase again at this price tag."
""
"Overall, the beer is oddly non-stout-like for a stout, having few strong coffee, ash, tobacco, or chocolate/black malt notes. Instead, it comes across as a slightly spiced and lightly soured Belgian, into which just a touch of coffee and chocolate malt had been added. Perhaps if this had been labelled as such, it would have been less strange on the tongue--but the stout label threw me off greatly, as did the watery mouthfeel."
"this might be one of those like it or hate it kind of beers. i could understand how one might think that there is too much going on here flavor wise, but i disagree. i like the combination of tartness and roasted barley. recommended."

"Now lose the cork, cage, and fancy bottle. Then drop the price to 7 bucks and you may have something to get us through the winter. My marketing instincts say that will never happen."

"Dr: Quite drinkable, hiding its ABV extraordinarily well. I'd have this again on draught for definite. I don't think it would age well, but it might pair decently with chocolate. All around, one of (if not the) best Samuel Adams beers I've tried. Worth a try for any Samuel Adams fan."
"D - Best offering from Sam Adams I've had. Hides its ABV extremely well and it's well built, complex and drinkable."
"Bottle. Pours dark brown with a Champaign like carbonation, short lived brown head. Medium, slightly crisp body. Taste and aroma is of plums cherry, Belgium yeast, coffee, chocolate, brown sugar, spices some vanilla and woody notes. Long semi-sweet finish. Delicious, complex brew."
""
""
"Not impressed with this one at all. Aroma consisted of plum, tobacco and vanilla oak. Taste was generally fruity with a small alcohol burn, nothing strong or very interesting. Became bored with this beer after first glass. Most prominent taste was plum and black licorice. Certainly not worth the hefty price tag and the barrel house Tripel is 100x better."
"Reminded me of La Fin in drinkability. Way easy and way smooth for its size. Not a behemoth of taste, but yummy in a restrained way. Could stand to be a bit thicker."
"A Belgian (milk?) stout. Coffee and lactose. Good looks, dark, foamy head, and lacey. Prominent coffee nose. Sweet and sour flavours.Decent drinkability.Middle mouthfeel.Not bad but expected something better from the ingredients. Great looking bottle."
"This is a complex stout with quite a bit of character. The sour aspect is prominent. The oak/vanilla adds a positive dimension to the stout character. This is a nice ""sipping"" brew that is reasonably priced, well-made and certainly worth drinking!"
"Overall: This is definitely a premier beer. Strong flavors and incredibly complex with sweet with bitter with a taste which amplifies the alcohol inside. I hope you all enjoy and don't take it for granted...Cheers to all!"
""
"Big fan of the barrel aged series from Sam Adams in general. This one poured a nice deep rich black. It had some great oakyness in the nose that really popped through in the taste. I was a little surprised how oak-forward the beer was, and how slightly one dimensional the taste was. It finished a whole lot thinner than you'd expect. Not necessarily in a bad way, just an observation. Still, overall enjoyed it quite a bit."

"great presentation from sam adams, who i keep wanting not to like because of how big they are, but who beer after beer continye to impress me hard. this one is in a unique cork and cage bottle with a fantastic shape. 10 bucks a go. pours a velvety crude oil color with what appears to be a lovely belgian yeast head, but shrinks quickly to a minimal layer of lace. smells like everything, belgian yeast, espresso, vanilla, and bourbon. taste is equally complex but nothing ovepowers anything else or asserts itself as dominant. does not scream stout at me, but thats okay. booze is not noticable at all until it gets warm, then it becomes quite strong, a even burns a bit on the way down. ive got to get my hands on more same barrel room beers. this is awesome, especially alongside some braised beef shortribs and long lost family!"

"Samuel Adams 13th Hour Stout is a very dark brown beer with a thick, creamy, beige head that has awesome retention and lacing. There is wood and spice in the aroma with notes of cinnamon and coffee. It's full bodied and smooth with a dry, slightly ragged finish. It's pretty complex and not very sweet. It has flavors of raisins and musk; cinnamon and dark chocolate, almost cherry. It's followed by a long, bitter coffee aftertaste. It's very unique."
""
"Tastes good and complex, but a little thin on the back end. Big fruit starts things off, nicely tart, moving into a middle that's unique and wonderfully pleasant--big vanilla, chocolate, and cinnamon spice. Not like a stout, not at all, but definitely a cool left turn for a Belgian Dark. But then... it drops off. There's some yeast in the back, sour and lightly burny, but nothing else."
"Mouthfeel is pretty full bodied but bubbly and crisp... something that wasn't quite expected but isn't bad. Overall, I'm impressed with this addition to the Barrel Room Collection. It's nice to have an affordable and approachable wild dark ale."

"Tastes like licorice port wine. This is extremely strong. It's well done, but it's just not the kind of beer that I prefer. There's a hint of molasses. It's carbonated. Descent burnt flavor to it. It dries out the mouth. To much like a wine/beer. Not my style."
""
"Poured into a goblet, the beer is a dark ruby-brown, almost to the point of black, with some auburn highlights around the edges, and a thin ring of biege-tan head. Pretty steady flow of carbonation throughout, also. The beer's nose is funky, with a slight boozey character, and some heavy earthy tones. The flavors are strong and complex, with a dark cocoa nib bittersweet backbone, some lighter old world fruit sweetness, including dates and fig, and an oaky, boozey tone. There are some coffee characteristics deep in the beer, and some sour highlights, as well. The aftertaste is a tarte and sweet dark fruit blend more than anything else, with a linger of cocoa. The finish is slick, with a slight linger. Light bodied for the power of all the flavors, but a very interesting blend of flavors."

"dark pour, nearly totally black with nice hints of brown around the edges and a head of light tan that sat on top throughout the entire session really quite nicely. aroma of roasted malts and peat, campfire smoke and a rich chocolate note.nice mixed of flavors here with loads rich campfire smoke. lots of caramel and hints of dark notes as it warms. smooth and lightly sweet in the finish i was quite impressed"
""
"Creamy mouthfeel, somewhat chewy, with low medium carbonation and a lingering, slightly sour aftertaste. Somewhat drying with the oak present in the finish as well. Quite good, an unusual stout to be sure, but I enjoyed it more than I anticipated."

"Pours a solid dark brown color with a decent khaki head that shows moderate retention and lace. The aroma has a distinct lactic tartness to it that seems to overpower everything else in the nose. Faint hints of chalk and yellow mustard come out. The label says Belgian stout with notes of spice, coffee, chocolate, and oak I wish I could find some of those in the nose! Taste is a bit different than the aroma lead me to believe although it is a bit tart and funky. Deep caramel and brown sugary malt mixed with toffee and hints of chocolate start us out on quite a journey. Midway through we turn lactic with fruity tart and sour notes filling the palette. We finish with a bit of warming alcohol, hints of roasted grains that even show a bit of an ashy edge and a bit of caramel. Medium to thick body with a moderate level of carbonation and a thick sweet tart chalky mouthfeel. Uhm wow this is not the beer I thought I bought, but I'm getting that a lot lately from Boston beer. The nose is extremely lackluster, but the flavor is a huge explosion of ever changing flavors that wake up even the most sedate taste buds. I may have to pick up a few more of these for further evaluation."
"O - This has good drinkability. I could easily have a few glasses of this one. Although, this is called a stout on the label, I would;t recommend going into this beer thinking of it as such. It is more of a belgian dark or quad. Overall, I think this is a really nice beer, and it has some nice chocolate and fruit flavors that work well with the belgian yeast. I recommend checking this one out. I enjoyed it."
"O: Well, I honestly have no clue what this should be categorized as. Instead, I'm just going to rate this on enjoyment in drinking it, which was quite a bit. Certainly unlike any beer I've had before, and quite enjoyable trying to figure out what it is I'm actually tasting. Just don't get fooled into thinking it's either a stout or BSDA or whatever else you might want to call it. Just enjoy it"
"Poured into a 13 oz tulip glass. Pours a blackish brown, with a one inch head that, doesn't hang around long. You can actually here the bubbles. No lacing to speak of. Smell very little stout, but Belgian is the main theme. Raisin, clove, hints of chocolate, and a little bourbon. Taste is everything from smell with vanilla, figs, brown sugar, and some hard candy. Body is fairly thin for the style and abv, nice carbonation anyway. Not my favorite style, very much Belgian and little stout. That being said it is a solid beer, but if Belgians aren't your thing and stouts are, you may be disappointed. 85% Belgian and 15% stout, but I liked it a surprising amount."
"750 ml bottle served in my St. Bernardus chalice at 51 degrees. Pours slightly darker than cola with a dense, cream-colored head embedded with tiny pinpricks. Head eventually settles into a consistent skim and a thick band around the edges. Arcs and spots of lacing are exposed on the tilt side of the glass with each quaff. Nose screams Belgian Strong Dark - dark vinous fruits, bubblegum, yeast and a hint of cocoa. Taste consistent with nose - more cocoa is revealed in the flavor profile as well as spice (perhaps nutmeg and anise) and a light, roasted quality towards the back. Mouthfeel is medlum-light with a slightly prickly carbonation and a trace of acidity. Definitely not a Belgian Style Stout; however, not a bad Belgian Strong Dark. That said, there are better examples of the style out there at this price point."
"Bottle says, ""Boston Beer Co., Boston MA &...Hammondsport NY."" WTF? I know Sam is far from a hometown brew but at least lie to me."
"O: a good brew, called a stout but categorized as a Belgian strong ale, fits the strong ale moniker better i think and is overall very smooth and nice to drink"
"Pours a dark, cola brown color with quick rush of bubbles, gone quickly. Taste leads with an intriguing blend of dark malt, splash of fruit and some tart funkiness. First things noted on the tongue were the very cola like carbonation and sour/tart funkiness, beyond those notes, fruit and chocolate peek through the solid malts. Medium bodied, very highly carbonated. Some odd components including the carbonation and funkiness did not work well with the base beer."
"Am looking forward to enjoying the second bottle I've bought sometime next spring."
"O: A good beer - so long as you don't try and place it within a specific category. Not very stout-like, but too sweet for a BSDA or Quad. I lowered the score here to reflect the fact that it didn't really fit either the description on the bottle or the category label. I was looking forward to a roasty stout tonight, and this was far from it."
"O- No descriptors on the bottle appear to be accurate. There are no stout characteristics, and besides the color not even any BSDA characteristics. Liked the beer, just not sure how to rate it because I feel it is mislabeled and like nothing I've had before... If I rated as a stout, it would get an F"
"750 ml corked and caged bottle poured a clear dark reddish rown with a lasting tan head. Aromas of fruittiness, dark chocolate, spice, cola and light coffee. Palate was light to medium bodied and smooth. Flavors of dark chocolate, fruittiness, spice, roastiness and light cola with a smooth lingering fruity chocolate finish."
"Mouthfeel"
"I have no idea where they get off calling this a stout. It's a belgian dark ale, for sure. It's actually not a bad dark ale, but as a stout it lacks the typical characteristics."
"(D)- Not bad, definitely fits the style in some ways, but overall, a spicy, heavy, stout-like combination."
"BA is rating this a Belgian Strong Dark. That makes sense to me. Why did SA call this a Stout? As a belgian dark its a nice beer i'd drink again next time I'm in the mood for a belgian dark. It actually tastes alot like last years Trader Joe's Vintage Ale (Unibroue). And if I'd known that, I wouldn't have opened so quickly. The TJ's Vintage was a nice cheap buy in 2010, but I would have paid more for it if it tasted like it does now, after a year in my cellar. This is an expensive imperial stout that tastes like an underaged $5 belgian dark ale. Thanks again SA, you never cease to disappoint me. Why do I keep trying your stuff?"
"Really interesting beer. The complexities and surprises weren't gimmicky or short lived. Things kept coming back to cause the experience to fly by all too fast. A 750 mL bottle? No problems."
"Nice, complex sipper. Interesting take on a belgian stout."
"O: It smells like a BSDA....tastes like a BSDA....feels like a BSDA....it's a BSDA. There is really nothing in this beer that would make me think of a stout, except for the wood notes and roasted malt. This is, though, the best Sam Adams brew I've tasted. It's really quite nice and on par with other BSDAs available."
"13th Hour pours a deep brown color, almost black, but allowing light to penetrate ever so slightly. A decent nose of coffee, plum and roasted chocolate malts. The sour twang is pretty damn foul when this beer is cold, as it warms, the funk becomes less offensive and does a good job in adding subtle complexities to this Belgian stout. With that said, this beer never screamed STOUT except for the nose. It was ok, not something I would buy for myself. I gave a great mark to the ""Overall"" score because of the custom bottle, great packaging."
"This was a good beer - worth trying of course, since we all have different tastes, but not one that I would buy again."
"As I'm sure you can guess, this certainly wouldn't grade out as a very good imperial stout (or any kind of stout for that matter). It's much more representative of a BSDA though it's not a great version in my opinion. Meh."
"D- again, I was not disappointed, but I wasn't totally impressed either. Just in between. A good attempt from Sam to get in the barrel aging game. I'll grab another one again"
"Overall: For a Sam Adams beer, this is great. For a Belgian Strong Dark Ale, this is a little weak. Not as much flavour as I had hoped for but it isn't a disappointment. I may try aging one of these in the future."
"(O) Not what I would have expected out of a stout. This beer is over spiced and over carbonated. I liked the idea and the aroma was very pleasant, quite awesome if I do say, but it was all downhill from there."
"I saw this the other day and picked up a bottle. Big fan of the Belgium beers so I was dubious as to how good this one would be. I must say I was very surprised by how good it was. The flavor is intense but in a good way. No off flavors, everything complementing each other. Good head and appearance overall. Would drink this again."
"O- One of the best offerings I have seen from Sam Adams. Definitely worth picking up if you see it."
"D - Good beer overall; would compliment a nice cheese"
"A decent Belgian style brew. Could use more flavor from the chocolate and coffee and less carbonation. I like that it keeps itself in check."
"nice aroma of roasted malts and burnt sugars - tastes pretty good - -roast-ey and sweet with some spice notes with a strong alcohol presence - medium bodied and silky smooth with medium carbonation - a good sipper - despite the 'confusion' of style, this is solid beer."
"Overall, this is a difficult brew to place. It is difficult to define stylistically, but beyond that it's difficult to say whether or not it's pleasant to drink or a chore -- it seems to fit in some strange middle ground of all these things, and therefore cannot be judged highly or lowly. It isn't a bad beer, for certain, but rather more of a questionable one. At $8.99, a bottle won't break the bank, and will make an interesting beer to share with a friend (it does, in fact, become more of a chore if drinking an entire bottle alone), but coming from a company with coffers much larger than many smaller breweries with similar offerings at equal or lesser cost, it could use a little price drop."
"Jim - you're a pioneer, and I respect the hell out of BBC...but the New World was light years ahead of this in terms of your ""reserve"" stuff. I don't know how many Belgian style stouts are aged in oak barrels either...so this doesn't seem to fit the category very well. No problems, and for $9.99 a bottle it's solid, but you're competing in a flooded market of thick barrel aged beers with this one, and to be frank I think it comes up a bit short."
"bottle, I'll put some age on it and taste again."
"O - I enjoyed this beer. Glad to try it. Not sure if I'd buy it though."
"Cage and cork bottle poured into 6 sampler glasses for all at the table to taste. Creates a nice creamy head that lasts over opaque black beer that does coat to lace. Nice moderate malt aroma of cookie, chocolate, banana bread, toffee, vanilla balanced with some floral perfume like hops. Initial flavor says choco-malto- sweetness showing a bitter/sour presence with esters to fit the Belgium category. Finish sour of long duration medium to full body, dry texture, fizzy carbonation that actually creates a nice feel."
"Overall a tasty offering from Sam Adams. Billed as a stout however, despite the esters."
"O- nice stout with some tartness. I guess i was spoiled with dark horse sour plead the fifth being my first sour stout."
"Randomly got to try some of this stuff this afternoon. I'm not gonna argue. It pours a very dark black-brown topped by a finger of cream-tan foam. The nose comprises cocoa powder, cinnamon, brown sugar, nutmeg, clove, very light roasted malts, and light oak. The taste brings in more of the same, though the roast is rather muted, and some vanilla and a touch of oak-based sourness come through as well. The body is a svelte medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a silky smooth feel. Overall, a solid brew, though the ""stout"" billing doesn't really seem to hold true. Still, it is quite good, a nice oak-aged bit of Belgian-y goodness."
