"Small head, dark body.  Aromas of dark malt, plums, raisins, and some vanilla and whiskey.  Lots of oak and cola notes with a bit of burnt malt lingering in the finish.  Medium thick body, average carb and a fairly dry finish.  Not bad, but it's a mediocre base beer with a less than stellar barrel treatment, not something that really needed to be made or that I would drink again."

"Good stout but not too rich in flavor."

" With the proper carbonation this beer may have been very different on the palate.  The malty flavors were good but they fell flat with  the lack of body."
""
"Overall- Tons of flavors develop in this beer, imperial stout qualities blend well with belgian yeast, nothing seems out of place. Stout qualities highlighted by creamy sweetness, combines with dark fruits and mild fruit sweetness, belgian yeast brings in some wildcard flavors to round everything out, woody spice, bready yeast, clove/banana."

"Smuttynose strikes again. Subpar stout."

"MMMM, good! Smooth. Tasty. Chewy. Very drinkable, especially during this snowy cold winter here on the Mid-Coast."
""
""
"Bluth frozen bananas in the nose; star anise, clove cigarettes, and a hint of mocha on the palate. Interesting, ultimately successful experiment w subtle bourbon barrel characteristics. What I expect from a Belgian-style stout. Would drink again."

"Pours a thin dusting across the surface, almost not sure if it’s there, same situation with the lacing, more or less nonexistent. The liquid is a pure brown color, fairly clear and transparent, curiously there’s a decent amount of beads with tiny, active bubbles. The nose mixes roast and sweetness, cocoa and coffee beans then cola and vanilla, some banana notes in there and has an herbaceous side as well. Medium-bodied, the carbonation has prickle during the mouth entry and then trails off. Vanilla, chocolate, cherry fruit makes it seem like a soft drink. Has that dough and banana element here too. The roast is mostly present as an aftertaste. Pleasant enough, not too sweet, overall though it comes off as flat-footed and one-dimensional."
""
"Pretty thin for a stout, it's smooth with almost no carbonation and a slightly bitter malty aftertaste that had a sweet caramel taste which lingers. Overall pretty good and very easy to drink. A nice hybrid, this Belgian style stout was smooth and hid the ABV quite well."

"Great, dark and full of many balanced flavores."

"Dark color with a finger of head. Weak retention with some lacing.  Flavors of mild coffee and rich Belgian chocolate. Aggressive, earthy, herbal hop presence. A little off balance. Medium body. High carbonation. Finishes with smooth woody, bourbon tones. Not the best barrel aged stout I've had but not the worst either."
""
"Pours a very dark brown, opaque in the glass, two fingers of creamy light brown colored head, a few rings on the glass. Smell: cocoa, plum, brown bread, red grape, caramel, bourbon-y booze sweetness. Taste: dark brown sugar, prune, chocolate note, toasted brown bread, plum skin, vanilla note, earth and berry in the finish. Barrel-aged quad-y. 2012."

"The barrel characteristics are not abundant enough to really raise the score. I enjoyed this but had you told me this was a breakfast stout I'd fallen for it."

"Served in half acre goblet - dark bodied with a light mocha head. I am not a Smuttynose enthusiast, though I know they are more capable than this. Smuttynose calls this a 'belgian style stout'. I guess I should be honest and state that I think the words 'belgian' and 'stout' should not be combined - the clash of yeast strains and dark roasty malt is very offputting to me. They sat this sucker in bourbon barrels for a bit too, but that's lost in the shuffle. Too bitter, too roasty - a mess"

"Not over the top barrel aged brew yet satisfying and I would even go as far to say that this is a sleeper in the world of whale hunting. I've had a few of these and look forward to this for years to come. These guys and gals always keep their craft extremely well priced and a solid fare! Can't find that whale, give this a go!"

"Beer is medium in weight, with carbonation of medium intensity, resulting in a creamy, foamy, pleasant mouthfeel that is never fizzy. Beer is maybe a bit thin for the style, but closes dry, with mild lingering astringency and substantial stickiness on the palate."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours an almost opaque super dark brown with a foamy khaki head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, cocoa, and slight bourbon aromas. Taste is much the same with cocoa and bourbon flavors on the finish. There is a medium amount of roasty bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that is tasty but fairly subdued for a barrel aged beer."
""
""
""
"Overall - Excellent brew. not sure if I'd consider it a stout or belgian dark ale, either way it was tasty. Didn't really get any bourbon in the nose or flavor, but this bottle is probably a year old so I'm sure that didn't help. Definitely would pick up another bomber of this for like around $7 I believe is what I paid."

"This is a very drinkable stout from Smuttynose. Their Big Beer series, which you really can't beat - ZINNEKE - is actually almost a sessionable stout with lots of sexy taste. Velvety smooth, a limited head, but one that is present and lurking the whole time, dark, too. Bourboney taste is very forward, but that's only if you pick up the difference between that and the oak. Really great beer."
"O- some good flavors going on, the bourbon is very subtle from only using a blend of barrel aged beer, a little light on flavor and mouthfeel for a stout"
"O: A solidly made, enjoyable beer. Drinkable."
""
""
""
""
""
"An interesting beer, I think a year of age will mellow out the burn and smooth out some of the other characteristics as well."
"O- Not one of my favorites from the Big Beer series but still very tasty."
""
""
""

"Poured from a bomber into a snifter, the beer pours a dark, rich, ruby highlighted blackish coloring with a tall, frothy, light tan colored head that quickly settles into a sparse surface coating. Aromas of berry fruit highlighting a rich and roasted chocolate backbone. The initial light, fruit sweetness has a great contrast on the nose with the rich sweetness of the backbone. Smells tasty. Flavors of roast, followed quickly by a fruit characteristics that I can only liken to boiling fruit down when you are preparing it for jams or jellies. It's that concentrated sweetness that still has a light characteristic. Again, the fruit has a strawberry/raspberry profile to it, and that is quickly enveloped by a dry roasted and baker's chocolate backbone, with a subtle bitterness that grows into a strong roast and bitter blend in the aftertaste. There are also some boozy qualities in the palate that slowly build, as well as a warmth. This is a dynamic brew, and the layers continue to develop as you drink. Let this one warm in the glass before you drink in order to fully appreciate it. Smooth, dry finish, with a slight bitter chocolate linger. Very tasty."
""
"22oz bottle poured into a 25oz snifter, the ale is near black and topped with a frothy tan head that holds excellent retention. Aromas are fruity, chocolate, roasty, bourbon, and boozy as it warms. Tastes are beautifully complex and balanced with notes of toasted grain, dark fruit - raisin, fig, date, chocolate, bourbon, vanilla, oak, some faint coffee, and Belgian yeast. Mouth-feel is full with nice carbonation, while finishing just dry enough for the palate to want another sip. At 8.4%, there actually was better drinkability, as opposed to some higher ABV stouts & strong ales. Overall, I loved it! One of my favorites out of the Big Beer Series."
""
""
"O: This is a nice beer if you like yeast, but doesn't have much in the way of dark fruits or bourbon, even after it warms up. It's rather easy to drink because no traces of alcohol are detectable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"D: This was not a great Belgian stout, and it had no bourbon character as advertised. The scent and taste were ok, and the body was decent. The finish was a bit harsh, so it was not super easy to drink. I'm not convinced age would improve either. Skip this unimpressive brew."
""
""
""
"Food Pairings: fondue with little mushroom skewers, BBQ with a heavy rich bbq sauce, I kind of want to reduce this and pour it over strawberry gelato. Gingerbread men sandwiches stuffed with a vanilla bourbon cream. lamb in a bicuit, roasted pork belly, hearty chilli with sour cream."
""

""
""
""
""
"Pretty good, but I’d prefer their regular Imperial Stout, to be honest. Nice balance of Stout and Belgian characteristics, could have used more barrel influence."
""
"Medium bodied with a decent balance of earthy hops, roasted malt and alcohol sweetness.  Dry piny bitterness up front with resinous oils and grassy pine needle flavor. This is countered by sweet chocolate, toffee and caramel as well as burnt toast, dark chocolate, oatmeal and roasted coffee bean.  Prominent boozy sweetness and heat in the finish.  Decently balanced but a touch too hot for my preference."
""
""
""
"O- I'd love to have more oak, there is a lot of chocolate and Belgian flavors. It's very unique and is a great balance between the flavors. If you made it an imperial stout, it would really make it an excellent beer."
"So-so, but I like the idea behind the interpretation. Lots of dark fruit and dark chocolate in the marriage. Not terribly far off."
"Overall not very good. Off flavors, unhappy yeast like it got too hot during fermentation, yeasty too, very little barrel, slimy, too estery, just overall not pleasant. Smuttynose really seems to be going in the wrong direction these days, their new beers haven't been very good, and even their old beers seem like they are losing a little something."
""
""
""
""
"O: A pretty good beer, but it's just a little too restrained across the board. A bolder stroke here or there would make all the difference."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- This beer has a nice black roasted malt flavor but it is otherwise a bit thin and a bit to hot in alcohol. There isn’t much yeast characteristics that it really needs for support or any other hop or malt flavors to add depth to the beer."
"O-Smutty missed the mark on this one, their regular Imperial Stout is good, this one, not so much."
"Cost: $5.99 for a 22 oz (bomber) bottle."
""
""
"O -- Love it. Really good. Good blend of different flavor profiles."
"O-pretty decent beer, had a good flavor and enjoyable to sip"
""
"Poured into a medium snifter. Color was a completely black opaque with a 1 finger light brown head. Aroma was a sweet fruity floral. A small bit of brown sugar lactose in the back. Seemed like an overly sweet barleywine. Flavor was mellow and balanced up front, but shifted to a slightly bitter oaky finish. Very good in the mouth, coated well with just a bit of carbonation. Overall a good stout, perhaps didn't benefit as much as expected from the aging, but not at all bad."
""
""
"This is kind of an odd one. Seems almost like a Belgian rauchbier, at first impression. I get a minimal to none impression of barrel aging on this. I mean, I guess I do get a mild sense of it, but it's kind of a glob of flavor and nothing specifically defined. It's a nice drinker, just not something I can really pinpoint as far as specifics or intent. Always nice to try something new from Smutty though."
"O: Good, not great. However, this one is pretty easy on the wallet."
"Deep dark brown colored with a low light brown head that settles out quickly. Low aroma of roasted malt and cocoa. Very rich flavor of deeply roasted malt, a bit of roast bitterness, cocoa, espresso, root beer, and molasses. Punctuated with a Belgian yeast type funk with clovey esters. Full mouthfeel, not too creamy, finishes slightly dry. Bitter roast lingers. Good beer, but the clovey funk detracts a bit for me."
""
""
"Pours a dark espresso brown with a two finger beige sea foam-like head that is reminiscent of heads found capping Belgian dubbels and quadrupels. Fades fairly quickly. Big fruity Belgian yeast, vanilla, cocoa power, hints of oak and bourbon booziness. Dark chocolate covered plums, fig, caramel maltiness, vanilla, and toasted oak. Very light bourbon accents appear midpalate. Finishes pleasantly dry with dates and black cherry and some continued chocolate accents. Medium, very drinkable body. Slick, with lively carbonation. Consider me impressed as this brew delivered a level of complexity that wasn't expected. Very drinkable, complex, and extremely unique. Not to mention, at $5.99 a bomber the value for the quality this brew delivers is fantastic. Highly recommended."
"The highlight here is a delightful finish that creeps up on you in the end, with a prominent dose of fresh roasted coffee, dark chocolate, and warming alcohol. The aftertaste holds steady for an impressive duration, affording plenty of time to savor. If the whole affair was as delicious as the finish, this could be special. As is, this remains an interesting fusion of Belgian ale and conventional stout, with plenty of flavor and texture to peruse. Would probably be phenomenal on nitro."
"Love the experimentation, but this one falls flat for me; the tastes are just a tangled mess of jumbles. Mediocre? Seems like an inappropriate word, but in the end, it fits."
""
""
"Chocolate, cocoa, bitter roast in the aftertaste. Lingering dried fruit traces of dates and plums. Smooth supple feel, medium bodied and slightly chewy. A little bit of dry woodiness in the aftertaste, but otherwise not much overt bourbon presence. Dry bitterness lingers in the finish. Nicely blended and well integrated. Smooth and warming on a cold winter afternoon."
""
""
"Creamy mouth with a chocolate coating and a robust body big on coffee flavor. The dark fruit/plumb notes are subdued in the background but come forward with some sweet caramel malt notes. A chewy malt mouthfeel with a lingering woody fruit finish. This one is full of flavor all over the place = a very tasty brew."
""
"Not sure why this had so many lackluster reviews. Anyone expecting a big bold imperial stout clearly doesn't know how to read a beer label. A relatively moderate 8.4% ABV makes for a nice midweek drink and the Belgian yeast certainly adds a nice fruity quality you don't find in Smuttys other stouts/porters."
""
""
""
"Starts with the black patent malt,which remains throughout the entire taste. There's an alcohol presence up front. Dark chocolate and mocha are the initial flavors. Relatively thin body with a high carbonation. The aftertaste has a dollop of bitterness with the aforementioned black patent flavors."
"Pours a two-finger off-white head that fades slowly leaving some lace. Black color, faint ruby highlights. Light carbonation and medium bodied. Roasted chocolate nose and flavor is chocolate, hints of caramel and bourbon. Bottle conditioned 2012, $6.79 for a 22oz bottle from Bert's Better Beers Hooksett, NH"
""
"D/O: A stout with stronger-than-normal yeast influences, this beer delivers on the Belgian promise but neglects the purported barrel aspect. The sensory qualities are divided between rich earth and yeast-affected fruit, probably to the detriment of this beer's overall character."
""
"This beer is just a mess that has too much going on and ends up going nowhere fast. Drainpour #3 in my life I think."
"For what it's worth, drinking this beer leaves me with some of the same palate sensations as smoking a cigar. As an interesting beer, 10-12 ounces would have been more than sufficient. The whole bomber is drinkable but taxing."
""
""
""
"O: Not a bad belgian stout. Very fruity. Lacks much barrel character outside of the drying char and oak. Lacks a lot of roasted malt character too, it gets lost in the mix with the drying oak and dark fruits and earthiness. Decent but nothing spectacular."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Pretty disappointing and not one I'll revisit. Very odd combination of flavors that really don't mesh well at all and leave an muddled beer in the final rundown."
""
""
""
"Nice brew, tasty sipper. Belgian dark ale blends well with the bourbon aging, and though the mouthfeel wasn't doing it for me, it was still an enjoyable brew and priced just right!"
"Pour black with a thin mocha head that faded fast. The smell was a nice mix with chocolate, vanilla, sweet notes, and some yeast. Big flavors, starts sweet with the higher ABV being very apparent. The bourbon barrel flavors are there along with the chocolate and coffee notes. This is much more a stout then a belgian. The mouthfeel could have been a bit heavier, but still smooth, and nice flavors. Overall the flavors are huge and tasty, but would have enjoyed it more if it had less of the alcohol flavors."
"(4.0) D: Very good. Stout characteristics are interesting in this with a dry roasted malt flavour coming through, but works very well together with more belgian strong dark ale qualities."
"This is a solid beer. Well balanced, complex, and perfect for a cold January night in upstate New York."
"A fairly complex, enjoyable & drinkable example of the style. As usual Smutty kicks ass"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A good dark ale. Solid flavors and aromas and easy to drink for a strong ale. Didn't get any Boubon flavor, but that's ok since it is a quality beer on it's own."
""

"22oz bottle obtained at Tully's in Wells, ME. Pours an opaque black body with a quarter inch of light tan head. Espresso and dark chocolate make up the aroma. Espresso hits the palate first, with dark chocolate, nut, coming back to roasted coffee in the finish. Medium in body and carbonation. A nice toasty stout for the cold months. Roasty and dry."
"O: Pretty good. 100% barrel-aging would make it a bit more memorable."
""
""
"Still enjoyed it, though."
""
""
""
"3.0 D: Eh, it's alright, but it's nothing special. I've never been a huge fan of bourbon and Belgian, but I still can't help myself from giving it a try."
"Stumbled onto this bottle during a recent trip to a nearby Binny's and felt it would be perfect for our New Year's Eve festivities. It pours a a bleak black-brown topped by a finger of sandy tan foam. The nose comprises cocoa powder, dark chocolate, and very light bourbon. The taste brings in more of the same, with a stronger sense of whiskey. Not much Belgian character is to be found here, at least by my tongue's reckoning. The body is a light-leaning medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a fluid feel. Overall, a solid beer, though the lack of any Belgian character, the relatively thin feel of the proceedings, and the general lack of complexity in general lead to a kind of nigh-disappointment on my end. In other words: this is indeed a tasty and enjoyable beer, but nothing much more than that."
"Pours a black color. 1/4 inch head of an off-tan color. Good retention and decent lacing. Smells of sweet malt, roasted malt, syrup, liquor, slight alcohol, and slight hop. Fits the style of a Belgian Strong Dark Ale. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of liquor, hops, sweet malt, roasted malt, alcohol, and a hint of syrup. Overall, good aroma, body, and blend."
""
"Overall: While not loved, it was well-liked."
""
"Hints of vanilla, caramel, dark fruit and bourbon on the nose. Poured dark brown with a thank tan head and appears reddish brown in the light. Tastes of roasted malts, plums and raisins with a bourbon and dark chocolate finish. Decent overall, starts a little sweet and finished bitter."
"Overall, a solid stout with a little fruit. Not over-hopped, which is a plus for me, but not a smooth beer, with some charred bitter edges and boozy notes. All flavors are up front."
""
""
""
""
"I can appreciate wghat Smuttybose was looking to accomplish here and pretty much nailed it outside of the bourbon barrel aspect."
"I had the Smutty small batch Belgian stout and I didn't like it at all (I don't like the style in general though). I don't know if this is a completely different recipe or just a bourbon-ized version but it's much better and my favorite of the style so far."
"The boy is medium with coarse carbonation. Overall this one is okay. Drinkable but it i don't notice much of the barrel and the aroma is pretty one dimensional."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall I am not sure what they were trying to accomplish or even if they drank it before it went out the door. To tell you the truth I was pretty much hoping it was a Belgium imperial stout like Weyerbacher tiny but I was TOTALLY wrong."
""
""
""
"Not a bad beer but it's not quite my thing. A interesting blend of styles. I think I'll stick to either full on quads or imperial stouts."
"Some would argue a Belgian Wheatwine Stout BSDA is a bad idea. I would agree with them. This yeast doesn't play well with other flavors here. I wouldn't get this again, suggest you do the same."
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied for the style with carbonation being about average. Overall, it was a pretty good beer. The fruity, yeasty notes dominated the aroma a little too much for me but the flavors came together pretty well The barrel aging didn't really seem to add much though unfortunately."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - I liked it and its a nice change of pace and a good hybrid to try when you get a chance."
"22 ounce bottle, 2012 vintage. Served in a goblet, the beer pours dark brown with about an inch tan head. Head retention is good, and there's a small amount of lacing. The brew smells like dark fruit (cherries, plums), roasted malt, bittersweet chocolate, bananas, and some vanilla. It tastes like bittersweet chocolate, dark fruit (plums, figs), roasted malt, molasses, vanilla, and a bit of smoke and banana. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it has moderate/high soft carbonation. I think this is a good overall Belgian-style stout. I don't think the partial batch barrel aging hurt this brew at all, although I'd like to try a version of this beer that was fully aged along with the base version of it as well. At $5.99 a bomber, I'd certainly pick this one up again."
""
""
""
""
"Overall this one is certainly worth a try. Complex and different. Imagining this would age very well and hope I can snag another bottle."
""
""
"This is a tasty beer - I feel like it could've been more though, the bourbon barrel didn't seem to add much here."
""
""
"A dessert beer and one of the best ""Belgian"" style stouts I've had. Not overwhelmed by yeast notes and carbonation."
"22oz. bottle served in a tulip. Pours the color and clarity of cola with a two inch, fizzy, khaki-colored head that sizzles and pops as it slowly collapses into a consistent skim. Delicate webs of lacing are revealed during the tasting. Nose expresses fruity esters as well as a hint of bubblegum and cocoa. Taste consistent with nose; however, there's also a roasty character to the flavor profile, as well as a slight metallic tinge towards the finish. Mouthfeel is medium-light in body with a lively, even carbonation. You don't see too many Belgian Stouts out there, so kudos to Smutty for putting one out. That said, while enjoyable, it's a little bit too fruit forward in my opinion. Nonetheless, a solid effort put forth by one of my favorite breweries."
"The taste starts sweet with caramel and bourbon and then evolves into a moderate lingering bitterness. The wood barrel is more noticeable in the taste than in the aroma. But overall this is a fine beer from Smuttynose."
"Overall: a nicely flavored Belgian ale that is easy to quaff and very satisfying. Definitely worthy of a try."
"D - Disappointed with this one. A little hot and messy tasting."
""
"Overall: The old and new beer blended works quite well here. You got interesting notes from both. I would have more in the future."
"Poured into a chalice pretty much black except when held close to the light there is some deep brown that barely shows,a thinner beige head atop.Caramel and toffee notes stick out most in the nose along with some Belgian yeasty spiced notes.A nice mix of earthy roasty stout,vanilla/barrel, and yeasty spiced Belgian Dark on the palate,not overly sweet and it's pretty earthy in the finish.Comparing this to the Thirteenth Hour Stout this wins because it's more complex and not overly sweet,it's just good."
""
"I like it, gonna put a bottle away for Christmas dinner and pair it with a decadent chocolate and raspberry cake."
""
""
""
""
"O- This is a good, not great effort from Smuttynose. The bourbon has more of a single malt scotch taste to me... lots of smoked peat, not so much vanilla/oak/maple syrup. Again, decent... but nothing that I'd be running out looking for."
""
""
"Overall as the beer warms I get more of the Belgian qualities of the beer, though I don't get much of the bourbon flavor that the beer is supposed to be aged in. Overall I like it and would have it again."
""
"O: An interesting and enjoyable beer overall. It says bourbon barrels on the bottle, though I don't really get any bourbon. The mix of flavors doesn't mesh perfectly, but it works well enough."
"Not really seeing much of the barrel influence here besides maybe a bit of vanilla and tiny bit of oak. The roastiness is just straight roast, no cocoa or coffee feel to me which is nice for a change. The yeast is massive with huge dark fruit and spice, especially as more time goes by."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I'm honestly confused by the lackluster reviews here... Yes, its thinner than some heavy Stouts- if you're looking for a regular Imperial Stout, this isn't one... But it does have enough alcohol and flavor complexity to make up for that and then some. Take it for what it is- a unique take on the Belgian Stout, and one of the most delicious beers around... If you ask me."
""
"22 oz. bomber poured into a pint glass. Looks great, smells good, although the hint of cherry gives me a slight foreboding. I drank this while watching the SEC Championship game, and I am a Georgia fan, so that may have colored my impression of the beer, although I tried to judge it objectively. The key words that sum up my experience were thin, sour, and fizzy. These are not features I look for in a stout."
""
""
""
"Overall, an interesting take on a belgian style stout that feels more belgian than stout. The barrel notes are almost so subtle that I completely miss them. The alcohol is also not as mellowed as I would expect. Not a bad beer at all, but a bit of a letdown for a favorite style of mine."
"Pours a solid dark brown/black color with a smallish tan head that shows good retention and spotty lace. Smells of roast, caramel, chocolate, brown sugar, dark dried fruits, a bit of lactose like sweetness, spicy Belgian yeasty esters, and a mild bit of vanilla. The flavor is actually quite complex. Mild chocolate and dark sugary sweetness up front that is almost immediately pushed aside for some peppery yeastiness. Juicy and lightly tart dark fruits come around next and meld with a bit of chocolate and roast before a touch of vanilla, oak, and ethanol show up. Long lingering sweet tart fruit sugar and chocolate finish last long after every sip. Medium to thick body with a light to moderate level of carbonation and a sweet sugary mouthfeel. Wow this one impressed me. It might be a hair on the sweet side, but I enjoyed the hell out of this brew."
"Overall I would like to see this beer a little heavier in body, with a larger percentage (possibly even 100%) aged in bourbon-oak. This is another solid beer from Smutty that I'll definitely buy again, perhaps even age some for half year to bring out more of the chocolate and dark fruit character. Good buy at $7 regardless!"
""
""
""
"O: A solid Belgian stout with a great influence from the Belgian yeast strain(s). I know only a portion is aged in bourbon barrels, but there really isn't too much of an influence to be found. I'd like to see how the base beer stands up to the barrel aged portion. Regardless, this is a solid brew with plenty of Belgian and American character"
""
"Overall real interesting palate, perhaps not an ultimate favorite to want again but certainly memorable."
""
"O: Tasty, goes down very easily, not too filling, good kick, good representation of style, it’s a very nice dark Belgian beer to drink for a long time."
""
""
""
""
"Flavor had some light sweetness, with choco and roastiness present. Also found were some dark fruit notes, a la raisin and figs. Vanilla and subtle bourbon characteristics are also noted here, and the bitterness was quite restrained. Solid all around! Zum Wohl!!"
