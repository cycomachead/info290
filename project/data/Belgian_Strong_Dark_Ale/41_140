It pours brilliant deep reddish chestnut under a 2" very white tan foam cap that slowly descends to a thick, lacy film. It enters the palate hinting of cherry that morphs to apricot backed by dark dried fruit (figs or dates but not prune) sweetened by dark sugar flavors with a bitter hop accent on the finish. The soft foamy texture is outstanding and is more apparent in the bottled version than on tap. The carbonation is above average and the body hovers around medium.","pat61","Mar 13, 2015"

4.34,4.8,3.75,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"2014 Christmas gift poured into an oversized chalice glass. Pours a slightly hazy brown amber color with nice thick off white head and okay lacing on the glass. Smells of carmelized brown sugar with dark fruit such as raisins, plum, fig, and dark poppy seeds. Has a spicy phenolic aroma with hints of black pepper. Tastes of the same carmelized brown sugar as in the nose. Seems to have a relatively significant upfront bitterness that lingers and really stings the tongue. Sweet tasting upfront with full bodied feel. Alcohol well in check. Overall, a very nice Belgian beer. Paired well with some turkey pot pie. Would be great as a winter warmer, for the holidays, or a nice celebratory beer with the corked & caged presentation.","jwhancher","Jan 23, 2015"
4.27,3.1,4.5,3.75,4.5,4.5,4.25,"Pours nice and dark (brown when held up to a light), with a smooth, lacy (whiter than expected) head. More sediment than seems reasonable...I'll need to be careful with the rest of the bottles. Not as much of a smell off the top as I was hoping for, but it hits your tongue nicely and goes down smoothly with not much of a hint as to its ABV. Malty with a bit of fruity (mostly raisins) sweetness, just the way I like it. Aftertaste is a bit weak (I love a beer that lets its flavour linger), but this is a great beer while you're drinking it.","CanadaBoy","Jan 22, 2015"

Had to wait several minutes for head to break and recede.  Beautiful deep ruby brown color.  I small malts like a loaf of fresh bread but not overpowering.  Not much else maybe caramel.  True Belgian Strong Ale.  Light bodied in the mouth.  Taste spices like cloves, nutmeg, caramel and hops.  Citrus buried in there as well.  Goes down smooth with no burn.  Hides the high abv well.  Winter Warmer on steroids.  Nicely drinkable.  Good change of pace beer from the fruit/vegetable beers and lighter than a heavy Russian Imperial Stout.  I like it but wasn't blown away.  $4.99 for a 12oz bottle.","uvachief","Jan 07, 2015"

Pours lightly hazy/cloudy deep reddish brown color with a 1-2 finger dense khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of big raisin, plum, cherry, fig, orange peel, caramel, molasses, toffee, dark bread, nuttiness, light chocolate, coriander, light pepper/clove, and herbal/yeast earthiness. Incredible complexity and balance of fruity/earthy yeast, spices, and dark/bready malt notes; with good strength. Taste of big raisin, plum, cherry, fig, orange peel, caramel, molasses, toffee, dark bread, nuttiness, light chocolate, coriander, light pepper/clove, and herbal/yeast earthiness. Slight earthy yeast spiciness on the finish; with lingering notes of raisin, plum, cherry, fig, orange peel, molasses, toffee, dark bread, nuttiness, light chocolate, light coriander/pepper/clove, and herbal/yeast earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity and robustness of fruity/earthy yeast, spices, and dark/bready malt flavors; with an awesome malt/yeast balance and zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a very smooth, moderately creamy, and lightly slick mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is an absolutely incredible Belgian strong Dark ale. All around amazing complexity and balance of fruity/earthy yeast, spices, and dark/bready malt sweetness; and very smooth to sip on for the ABV. An absolutely amazing offering. Love it every year.","superspak","Dec 05, 2014"

Either way, they contribute favorably to a very complex and drinkable brew. Flavors are strong and even rummy at times, but the texture is so airy and silky that it goes down all too easily.

I subsequently picked up this 250mL mini-bottle, which I'm trying just chilled, served in a Chimay chalice. Best before end 20/08/15. Beer pours a rich brown color with an epic head of a lighter brown. Beer appears to be loaded with bubbles. Aroma is pretty subtle, but yeasty, slightly funky, and spicy. Spice ("natural" spice, that is) comes through much more in the flavor, along with a really rich body, and a mouthfeel that is definitely not too heavy for this heady brew. This Belgian is unbelievably easy drinking due to its fantastic balance and complex flavors. You'll get drunk (or broke) long before getting bored of these.","hreb","Mar 24, 2013"

Aroma of dried and fresh dark fruit, bready malt and an almost minerally spicing. Flavor follows, dominated by dark dried fruit, brown sugar, coriander and oxidation flavors. Finishes semi-dry with dark fruit, spicing and faint hops. Medium bodied. The bottle has a "best before" date of 2015, but serious online research does not reveal how that translates to bottling date. There is noticeable, but pleasant oxidation flavor here, so I'm curious how old the bottle is. A pleasant, but somewhat understated Belgian strong dark ale.","LiquidAmber","Mar 05, 2013"

3.5,-15.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Served from tap into a Trappe Door tulip. Poured a deep brown ruby red with a two finger off-white head that subsided to a half finger slowly. Maintained nice lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, spice, funky fruit, fruit, and wood. The flavor was of sweet malt, spice, fruit, alcohol, banana, funky fruit, and earth. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was a decent brew. There was quite a bit going on in this one that I usually enjoy about the style. However, there was also something that was rather odd and out of place on this one with the funky fruit aspect. What in the Hell was this??? Not that it tasted or smelled bad, but it was definitely strange to pick up on for sure. As far as the style goes this was a pretty good representation of what one would expect from it. Worth your time trying if you have not done so before or are curious to see if you can pick up on that funky fruit aspect I got.","thagr81us","Jan 25, 2013"

Some fruity plum backnote tang on the back of the tongue and not much else. It's wetter tasting than a lot of Belgians and it's not overly sweet. Overall, it's ok.

This beer is very active and has a two finger head with good retention and some lacing; the foam is a light tan color and creamy. It smells of yeast, malted barely and a hint of molasses and alcohol. This is a very sweet beer- it tastes much like it smells. The most wonderful part of this brew in my opinion is the full carbonation that supports the alcohol sweetness. It's very refreshing. Definitely a beer worth buying and something I would get again.","Hopdaemon39","Jan 10, 2012"

Smell is pretty spicy and caramel, sweet ridden. Get alot of toffee, with some winter spice on top of some grain and a whiff of alcohol. Not all that impressive in all honesty. Taste pretty much solidifies my fears, Corsendonk Christmas really ain't about nothing. Sure it has some winter spice with caramel malt/toffee. I even get some faint applesauce taste and plum. It just comes down to, I don't like it all that much. It does not move me. The alcohol is hidden really well though, so there is that. Body is pretty dead on arrival, just feels like some life was lost on this. Medium in build, light in carby.

Pours a deep mahogany with a dense, fluffy, 1.5 inch, cream-colored head that eventually settles into a sold, quarter inch cap. Sheets of lacing appear on the tilt side of the glass leaving residual spots and strands of lacing as it disperses. Nose reminds me of concord grape jelly off the bottle pop; however this dissipates into a faint vinous quality. Yeast and a light earthy/herbal quality add a complementary component. Taste follows nose; however, I also get a slightly metallic character in the flavor profile towards the back which somewhat kills it for me. Mouthfeel is light-medium in consistency with a pleasant, easy carbonation and a slightly creamy texture. Overall, a decent BSD; however, the metallic flavor really negatively impacts an otherwise good brew. That said, alcohol is really well-hidden at 8.5%. I've been wanting to try this beer for a while but I have to say that I'm a little disappointed.","Jwale73","Dec 19, 2011"

Relative to other christmas-themed beer in general, however, this is spectacular because it isn't larded with spices and herbs. It's mildly fizzy and has a decent, if understated maltiness that could use a bit of a boost in the flavor and the density. I would like to have had a bit more warmth and zing; nonetheless it's worth a single bottle. I wouldn't invest in a four-pack.","gfreed","Dec 18, 2011"

I was still pre-teen, but I had had several cavities filled (and none since), but those candies ripped out the bottom two for the second time (!), the first time from Jujubes, another candy that I have not touched since.

Fruitcake of the homemade variety, chocolate-covered oranges, bitterness from the coriander and hops, and hints of carob powder and charcoal make for a very complex brew.

Quite the opposite, this finishes quite dry. The mid-palate really carries the fruit, and coupled with the strong yeast character, it brings to mind an almost tropical fruit-like intensity. As it warms, the malt complexity does grow, getting a mild dark caramel character to go with the prunes and burnt sugar.Dry with an earthy, leathery malt character, the alcohol is very well hidden here. Spicy and yeasty on the finish, this beer is medium-light on the palate with a high level of carbonation, much higher than I care for, REALLY foaming up in my mouth.

3.44,-16.9,3,4,3,3,4,"The bubbly head atop of dark brown garnet fluid quickly dissipates forming soapy sheet that disintegrates further into floating patches of agglomerated bubbles. The nose reveals citrus alike aroma that probably originates from copious use of coriander. Thin and crispy with well hidden alcohol the beer is bitter-sweet like a nutmeg and gives an impression of being heavily spiced with coriander and perhaps a warming sensation yielding black pepper. Flavor profile ends with lightly bitter hoppy finish with some dryness. This brew is overly spiced: the qualities of underlaying beer are entirely masked by generous additions of condiments. Spices should enhance the beer not subdue it.Thus I cannot say much about BSDA that served as a platform for this xmas ale - my guess is that brewers used a bit fortified Corsendonk Pater and enriched it with tons of additaments. Not impressed - Corsendonk xmas is like a woman who exaggerates with makeup - instead of stressing out her beauty she looks like a painted clown.","crnipeter","Dec 29, 2009"

Part of this is because I find that slightly stronger, heartier, spiced ales tend to be better suited to the holidays but mostly it is because this happens to be one of the more distinctive, flavourful, finely crafted ales I've had in Christmases past, present (and very likely) future.","biegaman","Dec 28, 2009"

This leads to an easy-going and warming brew (the ABV is hidden well) that has a slightly tart, dry finish to complement the overall sweet, silky texture of the beer as it passes over the tongue.

The taste is Belgian in that you'll get plenty of syrupy, candied sugar fermentation, sweet malts, yeasty carbonation and fizz, deep and rich fruitiness along the plum, apricot, prune family. The mouthfeel is thick, sweet, syrupy, warming, and wonderful. The aftertaste is fairly modest for a beer with 8.5% ABV. You won't get that throaty burn, but you will come back for more. L'Chaim.","albern","Dec 21, 2007"
3.74,-9.7,4.5,3,4,4.5,3.5,"Opaque dark brown beer with a big frothy that subsides but remains throught the drink. The smell is lightly molassesy and not much else. The taste is a progression of malty, kind of creamy, and tart. Some "Xmas spice" is detectable (cloves, cinnamon, etc.), mostly cloves, but subdued compared to the malty, creamy, brown sugar dryness. This beer has a creamy, smooth, but sharply carbonated medium body. Its drinkable but the maltyness has some cloyingness to it. It stll tasted really good to me though. Good beer.","BeerLover729","Dec 20, 2007"

The feel is well bodied and fizzy, though not as carbonated as the other Corsendonk brews. Perhaps the finest of the Corsendonk brews. Nicely balanced with well hidden alcohol. Nice and complex.

It smells like citrus, spices, dark fruit, bread, bananas and pears. It tastes very fruity, like dark fruit, pears and bananas, and also like pepper, cloves and Belgian yeast. Mouthfeel is medium/full, but a bit over-carbonated to me. Drinkability is OK, it's smooth but the high carbonation cuts down on the drinkability.

It starts out with a sweet caramel taste then it opens up into a floral, nutty flavor. The raisin and fruit tastes bloom throughout leaving a complex mix of flavor with every sip. As it warms the flavors become much more flowing and rich. The mouthfeel is great, no alcohol bit at all, just incredibly smooth and chewy.

The taste is also bready with a good amount of malt flavor followed by a slightly spicy and tart middle that is finished by a pleasant bitterness and slight warming from the alcohol.

The taste is sweet and characteristically Belgian. Full malt flavor with some alcohol and an abundance of fruit flavors. Theres very slight warming, and it hides its alcohol surprisingly well. Fairly high carbonation and quite full bodied. This is a complex and enjoyable winter ale. Id seek it out again.","Suds","Jan 19, 2007"

2.43,-41.3,3,2.5,2.5,2.5,2,"Served on draft in a regular Corsendonk cervoise, it was a dark amber in a color with very little head or carbonation, but left behind a nice khaki lace. The aroma was mainly sweet malt and yeast, but fairly mild. The taste was immediately dominated by anise, which gave way to a nice malt backbone and a bit of fig or prune, then a slightly boozy finish. I had trouble getting by the anise, which I'll admit is far from my favorite spice, and not normally so overbearing as to turn me off from the rest of the brew. The mouthfeel was a bit thin for the style, and since I didn't care for the spice used, I didn't find this one to be that drinkable. I should also note that the 8.5% ABV was no less evident then some of the +10% Noels that are much more balanced. I seem to recall liking the Corsendonk Noel last year, so I'm not sure if the recipe has changed, the keg I drank from needed aged, or my palate is finer tuned, but this year it's my least favorite of any holiday beer so far.","ccrida","Dec 13, 2006"

On the palate, brisk carbonation, followed by sugared date sweetness perfectly balanced by hops and spices. The fruit character is big and juicy, but plays well with the other elements. Mouthfeel is thick but not sludgy, with great winter consistency -- meaning it sticks to the ribs but isn't a chore to get down. Light carbonation helps out here, too, as it takes some of the load off tongue when the malt bill hits.

Taste is good, took awhile for me to pin it down, but I am getting a huge bubblegum taste in this. Kinda odd I think, never had a beer have this taste in it, not offensive, just interesting. Mouthfeel is a bit thin, and its the bubblegum flavor that does this, as soon as that flavor hits my sensors the beer gets all light and fluffylike in taste. I tend to prefer a thicker belgian beer so this was kinda a putoff for me.

Strong metallic notes, improving to raisins, dark fruits and chocolate. Some phenolic notes through middle. It all worked pretty well together. No hops to speak of. Medium bodied, low carbonation, drying with some alcohol warming. Overall, this beer has a lot going for it, but...many people have commented on metal in Belgians, but this is the most noticeable it has ever been for me.

The beer is not nearly as sweet tasting as the aroma would suggest, which is good as I was not sure if I was up fro a sticky brew. Notes of concentrated malt are here though. I get notes of dark caramelized fruit, notes of burnt raisins and roasted plums. Light notes of toasted malt join a hint of roasted grain. The fruit notes are what really stand out here; this brew is rich and satiating, yet actually not heavy and even a bit light and easy to drink, though I would characterize this as being light on the palate. Some spicy cola like notes are also in this beer as well as some light notes of clove. Actually the cola like note is definitely interesting, it is mostly the caramel flavors from cola, but definitely some of the spiciness is in this beer as well.

Pale tan head immediately fills the glass-then settles to one finger of dense soap bubbles, retains a cap very well and leaves spotty lacing. Complex phenolic nose with dark toasted malt in the background. Dark fruit aromas like dates and plums- and light fruits like peaches. The taste is sweet toasted dark malt upfront then turns tart and phenolic through the middle. The aftertaste hints at dryness, cleansing some of the mild residual fruit sweetness and faint phenolic bite. No perceivable hops here, but this balances fine without. Low carbonation and med/full body create a velvety texture, and the tart phenol/fruitness fades with the residual sugar for a satisfying but not overpowering finish. Drinks very well for the style...everything a Belgian strong dark ale should be.","PBRstreetgang","Mar 31, 2006"

The color is a solid brown with a ruby tint and floating spices and yeast; otherwise fairly clear with a stubborn foamstand. Smells malty, tart, spicy, woodsy, and lightly sour--typical of Belgians. Atypical in the use of nutmeg, allspice, cinnemon, and lightly pepperred. Viscous, round body with light wine, cider fruitiness and acidic. Finishes sweet, tart, and spicy with a light dryness.

Didn't notice any other discerning smells to make this winter seem more special than others; although it could be considered that this isn't a seasonal (other than the label) because the expiration date on this bottle was 2 years from now. The taste was pleasureable, and although the alc content is high, it really didn't come off that way to me. All in all, a very good example of the style, certainly worth picking up a few more.

The finish is long and warming, with all sorts of flavors still bouncing all over the place. Clove, nuts, prunes, bread even gingerbread cookie!

Over all this is a fantastic brew, glad I was able to give it a try and now a staple for the Christmas season.","Stimack","Dec 05, 2004"

It's another story on the palate though where we have another sad case of beer whose aroma doesn't match the aroma's promises. The flavors are just not so well blended together and the balance lacks where it's just some vaguely thrown spices to stop the sweetness. Not to help anything, it's very effervescent on the tongue, almost fizzy. Finish is malty sweet and a bit unclean.","Rastacouere","Apr 23, 2004"

Tucked away are the decent winter spices, hops are quite noticeable, incredible malt-based backbone, ginger, cinammon, fresh grapes, even a burnt liked toast presence to her.

Each sip brought out the changes in this beer as it warmed from the early crisp dry notes of spice and tobacco to the later fruity plum, bannana and fig flavors.

A whole lot going on here in the nose, big bready fruitcake aromas, molassas, chocolate, and alcohol. The flavor closely echos the aromas as many beers do. Very light carbonation contributes to a slick and appealing mouthfeel. Sweet malt, dark Belgian candy sugar, and fruity esters dominate the profile with hidden flavors lurking underneath the surface. Maybe a little maple and orange plus a bit of chocolate and plum. Each sip reveals something different. Alcohol definately plays a large role and its gut warming presence is quite detectable. No hops here to be found, though I suspect they were part of the recipe but have since faded away. Great winter brew. Goodbye my friend, on to this year's iteration.","DrewS","Dec 17, 2002"

4.73,14.3,5,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,"Another (ho hum) outstanding beer from Belgium. First off, I love the look (maybe it's the mood I'm in). It's garnet in color, topped initially by a frothy tan head. The head reduces to a millimeter layer across the top, which is continually fed by these moderately-fast moving streams of bubbles. Not quite champagne-like, but close. Smell is cooked plums, raisins, with hints of ginger, coriander, and orange. Taste is a festive combination of bread pudding and cooked plums. Spices hit in the middle, with coriander and ginger hitting first, followed by a mellow clove aspect, finishing with a touch of caramelized orange rind. Mild hop presence keeps things nicely balanced. I agree with other reviewers that the mouthfeel is a bit thin (due in part to moderately high carbonation), but I'm actually enjoying it. I will add this to my list of holiday traditions!","mophie","Dec 07, 2002"
3.85,-7,4,4,4,3.5,3.5,"Very tingly mouthfeel to start (settles a bit with time), with a round chocolate and date malt base. Very firm bitterness, tastes like it's mostly due to spice rather than hops. Curacao orange and spices (clove, coriander, ginger) start to round out the flavor along with a Belgian yeastiness through the sip. Finishes with a slightly bitter malt and spice flavor that's rather enjoyable. Very drinkable to start, but to me the spices would get old after a couple.","sponberg","Dec 06, 2002"
4.15,0.2,4.5,4.5,4,3,4.5,"Clear deep garnet in hue, topped by a beige, creamy, thick head that settles painfully slowly. Citrus rind, hints of spicy ginger, and slightly tart pear like fruity esters upfront in aroma are layered on top of a raisiny Special B malt undertone with notes of sweet milk chocolate. Light must and clove are present as well. Dark, date - like fruity sweetness hits the palate at first, then is ceded by a combination of curacao and hop bitterness. Spices are dominated by citrus, but a pleasant heat is provided by the mellow, seemingly freshly grated ginger root. Mild chocolate malt surfaces as the palate adjusts to the spices, adding to the overall complexity. Sweetness is derived from both dark caramel malt, slightly cidery dark candi sugar and residual unfermented sugar due to the low hop bitterness. Pleasantly sweet and spicy overall. A bit light in body and a touch too thin in mouthfeel to support the malt profile. Finishes with dryish notes of burnt toast and ginger. Corsendonk Xmas Ale is a delicious brew that exhibits a nice balance of caramel sweetness and spices. With a fuller body, this would be outstanding. Corsendonk Xmas ale is very tasty nonetheless, highly drinkable and a bit dangerous. Reminsecent of Anchor Our Special Ale kicked up a notch and fermented with a Belgian yeast.","marc77","Nov 30, 2002"
4.2,1.4,4,4,4.5,4,4,"I have found Belgian ales to be a bit cleaner on tap than refermented in the bottle and it definitely adds to the drinkability of this brew.","QXSTER1","Nov 27, 2002"
4.57,10.4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,"This beer is a deep clear ruby color. Just a swirl of a head. Color of brown. Recesses to an edging and a few peninsulas jutting out from the glass side. Lacing is intricate. Wood, cinamon and subtle pine notes make a presence on the nose. Body is about light-medium. Hard to believe this brew is 8.5 a/v. Not a trace of alcohol lingers on my tongue. Cinamon, ginger and nutmeg, oh my. Not sure if I've got all the spices correct, but there is definitely some nicely integrated spicing. Not as over the top as the Anchor "Our Special Ale," which is good in it's own right. Some slight bitterness is noted from the hopping. Maltiness is so subtle and nice. Delicate pine and spruce notes blend in nicely as well. Incredibly drinkable and tasty brew. Beautiful.","Bighuge","Nov 13, 2002"
4.62,11.6,4.5,5,5,4.5,3.5,"Notes: Similar flavours to an English Plum Pudding. Warms the soul during these long cold winter days. Very flavourful and lacks no complexity ... lively yet a brew to savour. Goes down in the books as one of the greatest winter brews ever ... fantastic!","Jason","Mar 12, 2002"
4.64,12.1,4,5,5,4,4,"This is a winter treat.  Lemony, citric aroma welcomes you to the first sip, and the citrus follows through in the flavor very nicely.  Interesting chocolate malt flavor that had a distinct tea-like character.","Brent","Dec 01, 2001"
