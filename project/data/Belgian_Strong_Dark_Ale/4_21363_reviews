"An excellent ale, powerful at ten and a half percent, but smooth and drinkable. A little bit of boozy heat, but the flavors are layered and complex. I got some dark fruits, like plum and cherry, along with caramel and a yummy bready base. Lots to like here."

"Light oak and very nice beer.  Nice sipper with the wheat and oak flavors."

"Overall: Very nice strong dark beer. I like their Allagash Dark a bit more, but that's also one of my all-time favorites, so maybe an unfair comparison."

"Overall: subtle, delicious"
"This was a draft at Tasty Beverage. It was a very good ale."
""
""

"O- All of the flavors are so well-integrated to this Belgian ale that the 10.4% ABV is hardly noticeable.  Delicious, dangerous stuff."

"Fantastic flavors of dark fruits with a touch of wood.  Body is light for the style, in a good way. Incredibly smooth."
"Would like a little more strength of flavor from this beer.  The flavors seemed ok to maybe even a little weak, but I think the carbonation detracted from the flavor in an unfortunate way."

"O-nice sipping beer, good for dessert"
""
""
""
""
"O: Everything apart from the taste is excellent, and even the latter is still pretty good. Maybe it's just personal tastes - this is superbly crafted, but not to my BSDA preferences. This is an excellent dessert beer, however (definitely worth snagging another to age a year or two)."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this is a superb beer. The flavors just keeps on going in a harmonious manner. Smooth and WAY to easy drinkingr at 10%... Added bonus is my wife enjoys it as much as I do, so we have been seeking out bottles. Just an overall enjoyable drinking experience. Job well done."

"Pours a deep amber with a white foam collar. Aroma of dark fruits and a wine like barrel note. Sweet, fruity and oaky aroma. In the taste, nice and malty, with candied nuts, cocoa, fruity wine, and dark fruit. The body is juicy, yet semi dry and has a rock solid carbonation earned from blending a portion from steel fermenters as well as barrel aging and blending. Overall, this is a winner. A very lively Belgian Strong Dark ale."

"The beer pours a decent brownish tan head that dissipates fairly quickly but still leaves enough of a creamy covering over the beer. The beer itself is an opaque dark purple brown color and leaves quite a bit of lacing on the glass. The beer smell has very strong wheat and barley smell that overtakes the other smells. The smell also has dark fruits and Belgian candi sugar notes underneath the malts. The barely smells a little burnt. The taste has the same notes as the smell but with a different intensity. The Belgian candy sugar and dark raisin notes dominate the taste while the barely shows up to take off the edge a little bit. The mouthfeel is heavy bodied with biting carbonation. The feel is slick. Overall, a pretty god beer and worth getting."
""
""
""
""
""
"The beer is quite sweet and bready, but dries off on the finish with woody oak barrel."
""
"Allagash Odyssey is great, much better than ""Four."" This is, for all intents and purposes, a Quad. Not quite as good overall as the Trappist titans, but it holds it's own."

"I’ll start by saying that I don’t like the Belgian yeast profile in general. There’s something spicy and funky about it that doesn't appeal to me. I’m definitely not a big fan of BSDAs. I wish I was though, then maybe I could enjoy this obviously good beer. The thing that I enjoy most is the aftertaste, where vanilla, oak, and a general warmth stick around for quite a while. Up front it’s a very satisfying sweet, grainy, spicy flavor profile. I am not a fan of the finish. Bitter funk dominates. So, between the front and the aftertaste, the stuff I don’t like about BSDAs really comes out. If you like BSDAs you’ll probably love it. I don’t know. A satisfying experience however. I drank it, so that definitely means its good. Some of the lamer BSDAs I can’t even finish. I probably shouldn't even be reviewing this beer. Do try."

"poured into a pint style glass but a bit smaller. a dark beer. aroma is a really nutty, (and I normally don't consider things nutty) and definitely getting warm roasty woody notes as well. hint of what i'd describe as vanilla wafer. excellent smelling but taste didn't quite match up. got hints of coacoa. little to no carbonation. i'm pretty sure this was on a nitro tap"

"Overall- Interesting take on the BSDA; unfortunately this style must not be for me. Seeing how expensive this one is makes me shake my head. I wouldn't buy this again if it was just me; though if you like BSDAs, this might be for you."
""
""
"Has this at Columbia Ale House and have it a 5. Wanted to have it again to give it a full review to see if it could hold on to the rating. Absolutely an awesome beer with very little to knock. I will certainly be willing to buy this again despite the cost."

"Overall an excellent dark Belgian ale. I never got a chance to try it fresh but it's fifth birthday coincided with the beginning of a new job so I decided it was time to celebrate!"
"Overall: I really enjoyed this beer from allagash but not as much as Curieux. This slight metallic after taste bothered me and the price is a bit steep. That being said I have never been dissappointed with Allagash and this is a really good beer."

"Sweet roasted malts, coffee, dried fruit and maybe some tobacco. Wow. Its so smooth and just a joy to drink. The wood is barely noticeable but really mellows out the brew to an almost chugable drink. This is fantastic."

"O - The beer really opens up close to room temperature. Great balance and complexity."
""
""
""
"The body was nicely full, yet wasn't heavy. The beer was smooth and even across the palate. For a beer with a nice bit of sweetness, this had a surprisingly dry finish. Drinkability was dangerously easy, I would have happily killed the 750 by myself. Overall, a very nice beer. A must try if you see it, and probably worth trading for."
""
""
"Poured a brownish, almost black hue with two finger head and lace ring that leaves patches. A roasted malt aroma first hits me, like coffee and toffee with a touch of bready toast and there's this sense of caramel and dark cholocate and syrupiness in the aroma as well, but not much in the fruit or hops department. Real smooth, creamy, thicker medium-bodied beer that has sweet notes abound like vanilla java, chocolate, caramel, some toffee, I swear some sweet fruit notes are evident. Great balance with roasted malts so it's not too sweet and has an edge, especially in the finish but not an ABV bite. Some woody or oakiness help smooth it out as well and make you want to keep drinking this beer. Not much else in terms of fruit flavors or hops, so I found this (and in no way is this a detriment) sweeter than your average belgian ale with less of that citric orange peel flavor you can expect. Overall, a must try for beer lover."

"Bottled in Feb 2013. Poured in a nonic, the beer is a vibrant, dark, amber-brown coloring with a thin, light, off-white head that remains low and tight to the surface. A steady flow of small, tight carbonation throughout the body of the brew. This looks tasty. Aromas of rich, dark sweetness in the background, including dates and raisins. A subtle grain overlay on the nose balances, with some nut sweetness revealing, also. Flavors are bold and smooth initially, with a blast of rich, old world fruit sweetness (date and fig) followed by a grainy and toasted wheat character that brings a touch of sharpness and cleanliness to the palate. Very balanced. The more you drink, the more you can pull from the palate, with some tart grape sweetness and hints of smoke and char. The dynamics of the flavors keep the elevated ABV from being blatantly recognizable, but there is a subtle warmth that builds as you drink. Nutty and sweet aftertaste, with a decent linger to it, leading to a slow, light, and slightly sweet finish. This is a great beer."
""
""
""
"Deep purple color with white head. Nose is funky with farmhouse qualities and dry oak character. Notes of dark fruit present along with white oak. Taste is fruit forward with dry notes of oak and grape. Mouthfeel is relatively light with moderate carbonation. Overall, lots of Belgian esters here, not my favorite brew."
"O: This is a great beer. The tastes here are so good, such a flavorful beer, lots of sweetness but absolutely not overpowering...this beer is right on."
""
""
""
""
"O: Low on dark fruit for style, this Belgian ale was disappointing but should appeal more to folks who like wild yeast and wheat in their beers more than I do."
""
""
""
"O- A solid BSDA, the oak flavors especially are very nice, but not much else really stands out. I'm not sure I would pick this up again when there are so many comparable beers at better price points."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Quick poll: Ulysses or Odysseus? Anyway, this stuff pours a lightly-hazy sienna topped by a finger of glowing off-cream foam. The nose comprises earthy berries, light maple syrup, and dry biscuit. The taste brings in more of the same, though now the berries are less tart, everything is generally sweeter, and some strong notes of oak make themselves more than known. The body is a lithe medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a drying finish. Overall, an alright beer, but one that just seems too scattershot, too schizoid, to be truly effective to my tongue. Frankly, I'm glad I've held off on buying bottles of this in the $15 or so range..."

"O – This beer not only rivals most good actual Belgian strong dark ales, but also surpasses a good amount of them. If I did a blind tasting, there is no way I would think that this was from anywhere other than Belgium. Even the mouthfeel mimics the true Belgians. Of all the aspects of a beer, I’ve found that American brewers have the hardest time finding the right Belgian mouthfeel. Drinking this beer was a truly wonderful experience. I can’t give a beer a perfect 5, but this is very, very close. It stands up with some of the best Belgians out there. This is a must try."

"T: Rich and malty upfront with a good hit of dates and raisins. Lots of oak, some chocolate and brown sugar. Finishes on a bit of a dry note, but has a great full mouthfeel. Good stuff but I don't think it's worth the price."
""
""
""

""
""
"I dont believe this beer is 10.4 abv. taste more like 8 percent."
""
""
"Overall: Not a bad beer; however, as an attempt at a Belgian Quad it again (for most American brewers) misses the mark, matching some of the flavors but missing many major components (dark fruit, Belgian candy sugar, etc.). The price point is another negative as there are much better options out there."
""
"Dark brown pour, hazy, with a small off-white head that dissipated mostly, leaving some thin lacing behind. Caramel malts in the nose, stone fruits, herbal hops and a touch of smoke. I actually got quite a bit of oak up front in this one, pretty toasty at that, caramel, peach and pear, a little raisin, yeast, herbal hops; no vanilla detected. Medium body, moderate carbonation, drinkable, and decent overall."
""
""
""
""
""
"This was fantastic. The oak came through and really complimented the base beer. The alcohol is noticeable, but it's spicy and plays well with the yeast and malt. This was a great beer from start to finish."
""
""
"O: What a great beer. What really sets this one apart is the level of complexity while maintaining an excellent balance of flavors. Every sip, something new stands out. I will say I didn't get a huge amount of belgian influence in this one oddly enough. It's a little fruity, a little earthy and a little spicy but nothing really stands out like so many BSDAs do. It's basically a belgian-style wheatwine aged on charred oak. Very tasty, very unique and expertly crafted."
""

"A fine choice for a nightcap or to sip on a colder winter evening. Too bad it's so pricy, else I would purchase it again. For the price, I can get two bottles of St. Bernardus Abt 12 or three bottles of Rochefort 10."
"O - Beer is something special. So glad I got a pour from this outstanding keg of beer."
""
"Drank a 2009 vintage pulled from my cellar this evening. Poured into an Allagash 40cl glass. Dark cola colored body with a ton of carbonation still left after 3 years of aging. Plenty of lacing. Smell has vanilla and bourbon. The taste was a bounty of caramel, rum, raisins, chocolate, and just a bit of smoke. Absolutely wonderful. Mouthfeel was insane. So smooth - it was like silk going down. Three years in the cellar did wonders for this beer. I want to get one another now and eagerly await 2015."
""
""
"O - Overall I was very pleasantly surprised. This beer is phenomenal. To date only Black and White have wowed me from Allgash, but this is on a whole new level."
"Overall: This is really an excellent beer on all fronts; great scents, even better flavors, a body that's not going to weigh you down too much (a full bottle is going to be quite a bit, but hell, it's not like I come across this a lot), and the alcohol is big, and I'm a fan of that. Cheers to Allagash, on perhaps their best beer that I've come across yet."
""

"Review from 5/2010 notes. Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Pours a dark orange brown. Medium tan head with good retention and lacing. Aroma of caramel malt, dark fruit and light oak. Unusual flavor of caramel malt, dark fruit, wood, and an odd astringent bitterness up front. Caramel and wood middle and finish with the same light bitterness. The bitter spicing and high alcohol make it appear somewhat medicinal, but this is very complex and well balanced. Medium bodied with some creaminess. A nice, very interesting take on a Belgian dark. Expensive, but worth it for the experience."

"O: This is just an outstanding ale. An excellent after dinner drink."
"O - What a distinct style of beer! The smokey oak plays off wonderfully against the dark fruits here. It just comes off a little too sweet for my palette."

"(originally reviewed: 04-24-2011)"
""

"Overall: Love the whole combination here. Truly an exceptional beer, the smoke and oak play delightfully with the great qualities of a BSDA. Am going back to find this again."

"Overall - Beautifully crafted beer. Incredible flavors and a perfect mouthfeel. This could stand up to some of the best Belgian darks."

"O - One of my favorite styles of beer, Allagash hit a homerun here. Strong flavors with smooth effects. Well melded and complex."
""
"Overall, very nice. Close to a 4.5 in taste for me but not quite. I found that the typical Belgian elements were fairly muted and that the beer had significant stout aspects to it. The oak is the real focus of the beer."
""
""
""
""
"O: One of my favorite styles of beer and this is a good offering - a little different/interesting with the hints of smoke. Quite easy to drink and definitely one to have again."
""
""
""
"Overall, a nice diferent take on a Belgian dark. I totally wasn't expecting to taste something like this."
"Poured from a bomber and served in a tulip glass. Poured very dark mahogany with a thick off-white head. Glowed a dark ruby red when held up to the light. Smelled of sweet dates and dark figs. The first sip was a surprise. Tasted of coffee with hints of dark chocolate and dark fruit with slight wood notes. Creamy mouthfeel. The alcohol was well hidden. I expected this to be much sweeter than it was. Though tasting of soft fruits, it had a nice dry finish. An impressive and complicated beer."
""
"Pours a very dark brown with a slight, lingering coffee colored head. Aroma of dark fruits, coffee and huge oak notes. Bit of sour cherries as well. Big baker's chocolate and coffee in the flavor. Oak and hints of dark fruits on the finish. Smooth and dry. ABV doesn't translate to flavor. Nice cohesive flavor in this unique brew."

""
""

"overall: An impressive brew. To be honest, not my favorite style but I appreciate the artistry here and glad I tried it."
""
"O: Very good. It's a bigger beer but still very drinkable. Again, I remember the bottle I had a few months back (which would have had ~1 year of age on it) had some more Belgian yeast/spice notes. This one is good, but a bit more stoutish."
""
""
""
"O: Man, I need to drink more Belgian styles aged on oak. All the things I like about this style is highlighted, while muting the ones that I don't. I continue to be impressed with almost everything that Allagash produces."
"On tap at Rustico's poured in sampler glass. Pours a cloudy brownish-amber color with a small beige head. Aroma of brown sugar, vanilla, oak, caramel, and sweet fruity bread. The flavor precisely follows suit. Only very minor oxidation has set in and it takes nothing away from the experience. Medium-bodied, with a sweet, coating mouthfeel and low carbonation. Overall a very nice beer!"
""
"Pours a clear copper color with a khaki head that settles to a thin cap. Thick rings of lace form on the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, toffee, and wood with some nutty aromas. Taste is of malt, toffee, brown sugar, wood, and alcohol. There is a noticeable alcohol warming in the back of the throat after each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a light crispness. Overall, this is a very good beer but I enjoyed the taste more than the smell."
""
""
"Beer is lighter in body than expected, strong throughout though. The oakiness adds a sort of bitterness almost like a hop at the end of the palate, this beer is fine but not good enough for the cost in my opinion."

"Overall this was an excellent brew and one of the best I have had from Allagash. Not a superb barrel aged beer, but a way above average Belgian Dark Strong for my tastes. It has the dark fruit flavors and the biscuity maltiness I enjoy in the style, but the yeastiness and dark fruits are complementary but never dominant (I have grown tired of boring standard Belgian yeast spiced beers)."
""
""
"Pours a dark reddish brown with a very thin off-white head. Aroma and flavor both have heavy wafts of oak and vanilla. Some hints of toffee and the sweetness is palpable on the nose even before you taste. It had a nice medium body and mouth feel -- not too light or too heavy. Doesn't have a ton of bitterness, but just enough to remind you that you're drinking a beer and not Malta or a bourbon. I bought a bottle at the brewery over the summer of 2011, cracked it open for the holidays that year. Lets hope they still have some when I head back up this summer -- might be my favorite Allagash brew."

"O -- A very nice oak aged ale. Nice flavor profile. Just wish the mouthfeel was a bit more substantial."
"Overall: This is simply put a fantastic beer and highly recommended thank you JealousChalice for sharing this amazing beer"
"Overall: An extremely drinkable BSDA-- one of the very best I've every had. I've only ever had one other brew from Allagash, but from these two, I can tell that this is one heck of a brewery. Unfortunately, it's not distributed in Indiana, but I'm going to take advantage of any opportunity I get to try their other brews. I highly recommend this one!"
"Pours a dark, dark brown color with a beautiful chocolate/cocoa colored two finger head. Excellent lacing on my snifter glass. This brew is impossible to see through, even when held to light. Great looking beer. In the nose I get: fig, tobacco, bourbon, oak, clove, and other dark fruit. Pretty smooth, and warming helps tremendously. Not quite up to the best Belgians, but it's REALLY close. HOLY CRAP. This is one amazing tasting beer! I definitely get caramel/toffee, w/ the fruits, slight bourbon, but this isn't boozy at all. In fact, I don't detect any of the 10.4% alcohol in this beer. It just gets better and better the more it warms too. It's super smooth, silky, and feels like a million bucks in the feel department. The only ding I can give it is that I'd like the feel to be a little more full bodied- but that's grasping at straws. Overall, this is an amazing brew and I recommend you buy it immediately if you see it for under $20/750ml... Cheers!"
"Overall this is a great beer. The flavor is nice much nicer than I can accurately describe. Allagash make some great brews and this one is no different. If you can find this on the shelf it is a must buy no matter the price."
"Another expensive Allagash beer where you get what you pay for. On a personal note, it makes me smile that one of the first craft breweries that ever caught my interest can continue to satisfy me no matter how many beers I try or ""palate changes"" I experience."
"Overall, I feel this is a great beer. Do I think its worth the bottle price? No. I also have to say, I prefer the Currieux (which is still very pricey) and it is much more available. Will definitely buy this beer again when I win the lottery. (please lower your beer prices Allagash)"
"D - A little more malt complexity would really work well with the oak. Solid beer."
"(O) Even though there is a slight hint of alcohol in the nose, it's not found in the taste. There's a good balance in this beer but there is a decent amount going on in the taste. The more it opens up, warmer it gets, and longer you take to drink it, it develops a lot and gradually changes."
"Really nice Belgian Strong Dark here. One and a half years of cellaring is just about right."
"Alcohol well-hidden. Dry finish with medium body and a pretty average mouthfeel."
"O: Overall not too bad I'd like to try a fresher bottle next time. Appearance is where this beer really shines. All in all I'm glad I got to try this one. Again heed caution with the cork! Sorry Billy! 3.5"
"O. Pretty good stuff. The oak isn't as strong as I thought it would be, but personally I think that's good. I would be happy to have it again."
"A very good beer, but not quite the giant that I had hoped for. I kept waiting for it to open up even more as it warmed and it never really became epic. Very good…just not great."
"O: Considering this is 17 months old I'd say its pretty good. Oakiness isn't terribly invasive, but the taste isn't top notch."
"Creamy and full body with really subtle carbonation. Overall a pretty rockin' brew. Pretty complex and a lot going on. Really enjoyable sipper."
"More great stuff from Allagash. This is top notch. I'll be looking to replace this bottle soon."
"D - Awesome drink; this is fantastic; great taste and flavor; awesome nose (could have used a hint of more oak and toffee); just really great stuff; enjoy, I know you will!"
"(D)- This is excellent. Though, not much on the nose, this is elegantly balanced with a great feel and taste. Just excellent and possibly one of the best of the style coming from the states."
"I picked this one up because sometimes Allagash really gets my attention. I knew I hadn't tried this one before so I wanted to give it a shot. The beer poured out as a nice dark brown color. There was a light lacing from the white head on the glass. The smell of the beer had some wheat, fig and wood aromas going on in there. The taste pulled all those things to gether with the addition of a minimal tartness and a hint of grapes or raison. The mouthfeel was pretty good, it had a decent carbonation it and it had a steady medium body as well. I'm glad I tried this one because I ended up liking it more than I expected to. Would drink this one again."
"Drinkability – This is one smooth sipping beer. Nice marriage of fruity sweetness, molasses, and oak. Allagash knows how to get it done."
"Overall is a really good beer. Looking forward to more Allagash stuff."
"O - A solid BA beer, but it really can't compete with the top-tier beers."
"O- Again with Allagash I am not all that impressed. Not sure what I was expecting with this beer but not sure I would get it again."
"O: great from the Growler as well as on tap. Now to try it from the bottle."
"overall, another wonderful, delicious and complex brew from Allagash. A unique blend of different styles and flavors that work very, very well together."
"O: Very solid beer, a nice slow sipper that I would like to drink again, maybe even sit on some for a while."
"- Cases bottled: 550"
"Overall, Odyssey is a very good attempt at a Belgian quadrupel, especially for an American brewer. Putting this in oak barrels adds an odd and unexpected twist to the beer, but this just adds to the Americanized intrigue of the brew. I would have this again and drink it with the most highly thought of quadrupels."
"O: It's quite good. I find the spices played up too much for my liking, but its dryness is appealing, and the superb use of oak makes it stand out from other examples of the style. Hopefully they'll play around with the recipe some more to make it better (or what I consider better)."
"A wonderful BSDA. I would be happy to drink this again anytime, anywhere. I'll drive out of my way to drink this beer."
"Overall, not really was I was expecting. Too roasted for a Belgian. I liked the oak in the nose, but it was much more faint in the taste, unfortunately."
"O: Good"
"my initial reaction was that it was a bit too spicy, but as i drank and the beer warmed, it opened up some and appreciably improved. you don't get a lot of bang for you buck here but it's a high quality brew worthy of the splurge from time to time."
"Overall, I gotta try this again, cause im pissed I passed this up for so long. On tap this is a must for me now, alcohol be damned."
"jd"
"I had this with someone who can't drink beer at all normally, because of its heaviness or alcohol or a combination thereof. But after they tried a taste, they poured a glass and downed the whole thing, way faster than I. Imminently drinkable. Pretty cool stuff."
"Drink- Holy hell this was good. I want more and want it now. Its 10.4 but lets do some beer bongs and some beer pong with it, just to keep drinking it."
"O: Enjoyable, certainly lives up to expectations."
"Ridiculously complex. One of those transcendent beer experiences where you remember where you were and what you were doing and who you were with (tapering, seven days out from the Boston marathon watching the Sox game with Amber if you must know). Good stuff."
"D/O: Wow... this thing is so easy to drink and the alcohol is completely unnoticed. I want another bottle, even though it's $16!! Definitely well worth the price, and then some. Gotta watch out though, because this is a monster of a beer disguised as something much, much smaller"
"D: One of most well made and drinkable Belgian Strong Dark Ales I've tried in a while."
"d - A good beer, but a little to much spice for me. Glad to have tried it and would given another shot, but probably wouldn't seek out again."
"D - Drinkability is moderate. I was looking forward to this beer, so maybe my expectations tempered this beer a little, but I didn't find it completely blowing me away. Solid beer, but given the price I'm sure this bottle cost, I would like to see me influence of the barrel on here. As it is now, the oak imparts only a faint trace of its woodiness to the beer that's almost negligible."
"I was getting a little worried about Allagash, I had many of their beers both on bottle and tap and they were always disappointing me. I was beginning to think they couldn't make good Belgian styles. In a way they did better, they made something that is truly their own."
"Medium bodied, low carbonation. There was not much of a pop when the cork was opened, very muted. Still a very nice beer. I would definitely like to try this again sometime."
"D: Oh sooo drinkable I wish I had a hundred of em."
"D- Very drinkable but very alcoholic in nature but if i had the chance to consume alot of the perfectly crafted beer I would drink as much as allowed."
"D - The beer is delicious and so easy to drink. A definite repeat for me if it was possible."
"D- easy to finish my half of this bottle. not my favorite example of the style, but the oak aging does add something different. the next time i drink a bottle of this, its going to be alot older. 3-4 years maybe?"
"This one drinks waaay too easy. The body helps it go down extremely quickly with deliciously complex flavors that don't promote pauses."
"EDIT: just read the description & realized it's a Belgian ""wheat"" beer. Couldn't figure out where the wheatiness was coming from, now I know I'm not crazy."
"For a beer that I was looking forward to for such a long time, I was left disappointed. The aroma and flavor just did not do it for me. Maybe I should try a different vintage?"
"Overall, this was a decent beer but I don't think it was a great beer. Maybe the age didn't do this bottle well. I liked it but I don't know if I'll go back. There's enough here that I want to try other beers by Allagash. I would recommend picking it up if you're a fan of Belgian Dark Strong Ales and bourbon barrel beers, otherwise I might recommend going elsewhere. Cheers."
"M, D- Medium-full bodied, but quite drinkable. A touch weak on CO2."
"Overall was a little sweeter than I had expected and the alcohol was disguised well, but left enough to remind you to take it easy."
"D: Wow, brilliant, this tastes like an imperial stout with Belgian funk in the nose but not enough to influence the taste all that much (unlike Belgian style imperial stouts like JP Dark Dawn). The wheat base helps this beer's cause as it makes it lighter and easier to drink."
"Good beer all around. It takes a while to pick up the flavors, but after you do, this beer strives with the subtleties."
"The mouthfeel"
"D - Not too hot for the ABV. Not bad, not great."
"A little bubbly at first, but as it warmed it even out nice. Medium body, just enough stickiness and smooth. Goes down quite easy for such a big beer."
"D: A great BSDA. I love the oak character in this one. Definitely on par with its Belgian counterparts."
"Much love Joseph, I will never stop missing you brother."
"A seductive ale, best served lightly chilled and pondered over. Would pair well with certain cheeses (maybe a Gruyère)."
"A bit pricy, but this is yet another great beer from Allagash."
"CHEERS!!"
"D- im going through this 750 by myself and am not feeling it a bit"
"Pretty good brew. Poured with a small to medium light tan head that mostly settles out and a bit of lace. Color is a lovely, clear mahoganey. Aroma is really nice with some slightly smokey, roasty malt, burnt wood, dark ripe fruit and a bit of toffee. Flavor is like that, but lots of the smoke disappears leaving only a bare hint; sweetness comes out more but all is well balanced. Body is just right, mouth filling and cut well by carboantion. Finish is like flavor, fairly long and with an oakey lingering sweetness along with some alcohol. Again a tad sweet for me to drink more than this botte. But it is a pretty pow beer."
"Overall, a really well done beer that I would definitely buy time and time again as a go-to dark belgian."
"MD - Creamy and unbelievably drinkable for a 10%. I could easily drink a few of these but that would prove to be dangerous."
"Overall, it was an expensive bottle, and a little disappointing, but I'm glad I tried it."
"D - If you don't have someone to share this with, finishing the bottle in a sitting is no problem. You'll definitely start to feel it at the end, but you wont want to stop!"
"Not a world class Belgian strong dark, as far as I'm concerned, but a very capable rendition."
"D: A good drinker."
"At the Allagash promo recently at the Coppermine Pub in North Arlington, NJ. Into a tulip, poured a deep mahogany, with a thin beige head and decent lacing. Great nose: dark fruit/prunes, candi sugar, clove, blackberries. The taste was sweet first, dissolving to spiciness, and a very dry finish, which left me cottonmouth afterwards (a little too much so). Impressively, no hint of the alcohol content. The feel was very smooth and full-bodied, with very little carbonation. A pleasant flavor mix, but the cottonmouth after-effect had me reaching for another offering after downing this one. Nonetheless, another great job by the Allagash crew."
"Notes: Another barrel offering from Allagash with a deceptively soft and gentle profile, hiding a firm richness, and nice complex subtleties. I don´t know If I would pick up the Curieux over this one, but both are quite remarkable."
"Drinks: like an heir to the throne. Maine's Allagash is already the closest an American brewery can get to Belgium, at least physically. Odyssey shows that the gap in brewing skill is even less broad. It could stand tall against any other BSDA -- or against any beer, really."
"Out of a 750ml corked and caged bottle. Pours a chocolate brown color with a smallish tan head that settled into a light ring. The aroma seems quite light for the style and for the barrel aging. The aroma is sweet from the candi sugar, subtle spice and has a light oak flavor. I really don't pick up much else which is disappointing. The taste does have the traditional BSDA flavors. Dark candi sugar sweetness, honey, dark fruit, carob, and clove. I do detect vanilla and tobacco which gives the beer a nice earthy flavor. The sour oak flavor pops through in the end. The feel is light to moderate with very airy carbonation; makes me want to burp a lot. Sweet throughout with a touch of sour in the end. ABV is ridiculously well hidden, dangerous. A solid BSDA base with some subtle hints of barrel aging. Drinks very well."
"D: Better as it warms up past cellar temperature, but nothing terribly special at this point. It's lacking in any real depth, which is surprising given that the bottle is nearly a year old."
"D - Too strong. There are lots of others that are better in the style for the price, but was glad I tried it."
"deep mahogany with light red highlights where light penitrates the beer. Kinda still in the glass. I get a lot of coffee, toffee, and chocolate up front. Light vanilla and bready malts following in the background. More coffee and toffee chocolate on the palate. Sweet malty backbone, light hop bitterness and a small amount of that hot flavor contributed by the alcohol. Really smooth, thick and rich over the tongue. Super easy to drink. A great beer by a great beer producer."
"Pours murky brown with a vast off tan head. The aroma is fruity, apple, pineapple, with a phenolic edge as it warms. Flavor is dark and grainy, wheat and oats, with spiced pear, apricot, roasted apple. The cereal character is huge. The finish is mellow and smooth. Good but strange."
"Allagash Brewing Company is one of those breweries that has earned a special place in my book. I recently heard they were leaving Ohio. Very unfortunate. Odyssey is no doubt a very impressive BSDA. In comparing recent Allagash experiences (although a different style), I prefer Interlude, but Odyssey is well worth your attention. It's very deep in all respects, and is very refined. I think it'd be a little better if it had something sweet in the mix. It's missing something in that department, and I can't help but notice. Nonetheless, very impressive stuff. Find a bottle."
"Pours a murky reddish brown in color with minimal fluff of head but leaves good lacing. Scent is of sweet malts, touches or fresh grain, earth, oak, light spice and floral hops. Taste is a rather undewhelming blend of dark crsty bread, sweet malts, very mild spicing - failry weak tasting. Lighter side of Medium body but somewhat watery. Just doesnt do much for me, mild without being complex, lacks assertiveness and a good oak quality from he aging."
"This is a very drinkable beer, which i enjoyed out on the deck on a nice clear cool night. You couldn't taste the alcohol which was surprising at 10% ABV. So go slow and enjoy."
"City Beer Store, Allagash night. Very dark ruby/brown beer with a great big head, beige with lots of lacing. I always have a hard time describing Allagash's beers; there's some subtlety that's difficult to put into words. The beer builds on a clean grain flavor with big caramel/brown sugar and fruity malt notes, raisins and plums. There's some definite dark malt presence, as well. Chocolate and light coffee add some very interesting touches. Lots of oak and definite bourbon (better than Curieux but still a tad odd, in my opinion). Carbonation is relatively light. Flavor is fairly sweet. It doesn't quite come together for me, but it's an interesting and obviously well-made beer."
"D: No signs of the 10% ABV, very smooth going down. As the bartender joked, ""This is so smooth, I'd give to my mom"". Would pair well with sharp cheese or a hearty stew."
"Taste: Semisweet vanilla, slightly oaked chocolate malts, and raisins up front are awesome. Plateaus at some roasted malts in the middle that has a punch of sweet, ripe prunes and caramelized wood followed by some pepper and more roasted malts and yeastiness. Finish is cocoa, semidry, oaky, and ripe prunes."
"D: Drinkability is somewhat limited due to the richness and thickness of this brew, and also the high abv. This would make an excellent dessert beer. I will definitely get this again and share it."
"Taste is very rich and complex. Light oaky notes and vanilla creaminess. It's a very creamy mouthfeel with a great amount of carbonation. For being 10% you'd have no idea."
"the mouthfeel is great. i guess"
"Bottle pours a dark brown black with a little bit of foam forming in the chimay glass. The taste is of dark malt with a hint of dark fruits and a little bit of floral hops. Its really quite delicious and probably one of the best belgian style beers I have had to date. Very smooth and the alc % is well hidden. Very happy I picked one of these up, but sad to see its gone. Very damn good beer."
"Dark brown in the glass, capped by a thick, creamy tan head. Great nose on this one. Dark fruits, dark candi sugar, molasses and tobacco, all complemented beautifully by just the right amount of bourbon. Flavors of plums, chocolate covered caramels, vanilla, oak and bourbon. Finishes up with a bit of sourness, warming alcohol and sweet bourbon. An excellent beer."
"Poured a corked and caged 750ml into my New Belgium globe glass. This beer pours a muddy tea with a decent 2-inch head that leaves just a little amount of lacing down the sides of the glass. When held up to the light, slight ruby rays shine through on the edges of the glass. The aroma is amazing. Huge notes of figs and dates, toffee, a bit of chocolate, oak, green apple, and sweet raisins. The flavor is a explosion. This could well be the most flavorful Belgian style beer I've ever had the opportunity to try. Wow, just amazing. Up front comes silky toffee with a hint of 80% dark chocolate. Figs and dates, raisins, fresh uncharred oak and sour pie cherries. The flavors are so independent yet blend flawlessly together. It's like a puzzle where each piece is a different color. Amazing. The mouthfeel is silky smooth, leaving an explosion of flavor lying on the palate. Overall this could be the best American take on a Belgian style (minus 1 or 2 American Saisons) that I've ever had. Amazing."
"D: The Odyssey drinks very well on draft. Now I want to find a bottle and see how that compares. I have a feeling the mouthfeel will perk up and this great brew will become even better."
"D: A different beer but a bit young I think. This salty/meaty thing though not as prevalent as this review might indicate, is just enough of a distraction to make this beer less enjoyable than it should considering how amazingly smooth this beer is. I would like to pick up this beer again and lay it down for a couple of years and see what some age might do for this beer."
"Overall, a complex and flavorful Belgian brew. The oak notes are nice and not overpowering. Incredibly easy to drink and light on the palate, while still managing to be complex. My one complaint is that the Belgian notes do not assert themselves enough for me."
"Pondering and cataloging the bevy of flavors on display will definitely keep you sipping as long as you can, which is indicative of the ease with which this masterpiece can be consumed."
"Pours a deep brown with great looking crown of head that sticks around forever. Great looking beer. Smell is of sweetness of toffee, candied sugar along with plums, and hints of the oak/booze. Taste is much like the nose but with the oak moving more to the forefront with the candied sugar and dark fruit taking a little more of a back seat. Farily full body that gives a nice warming sensation. Overall this is a great beer."
"D- This is a great beer overall. ABV still somewhat detectable but not out of check in any way, shape or form. I wish there was a bit more oak barrel presence as well. Overall I think this is a great brew and great example of BSDA and measures well against the greats of the style."
"Reviewed from my tasting notes. The beer is colored dark plum with some brown. There is a tiny ring of off-white bubbles. It's an opaque beer; I can't see inside of it to detect any rising carbonation. There isn't much aroma that I could detect. It's a little musty and a little fruity. There may be some lime or cranberry notes; whatever it is, it reminds me of juice. It's a very dry beer with lots of yeast and wheat but not too much malt or hop flavor. There is a slight touch of sour and a hint of chocolate. It feels super crisp and dry. There are lots of tiny bubbles to be felt as well. It leaves a neat coat behind--I can only describe it as crumbly, like how your mouth feels after eating a dry cracker. It's a very different sensation for a beer to provide. I find it to be pretty drinkable. This single glass drinks well, but I think I would want to split a bottle."
"A very unique and great beer. Different than most belgian dark ales, the characteristic clove overtones is missing and replaced with creamy, smooth dark fruits. All of the flavors are very subtle with nothing too over the top. This works wonderfully with the incredible creamy smoothness in the mouthfeel. i really couldn't detect much alcohol at all, which is amazing for a 10% beer. I also enjoyed how the oak was not overwhelming at all, in fact, it was just barely detectable, yet still had a presense. All in all, a great beer."
"My 2nd time having this on-tap. Served in an Allagash tulip (I love this glass, I gotta get one). Dark brown with a great off-white head, sticks around and leaves thick lacing down the glass. Smell is faint with yeast, clove, dark fruit. Taste is great, clove, raisins, plum, booze, spice. Love the spicy taste here. Mouthfeel is excellent, very smooth and covers your taste buds with Belgian velvet. Booze is noticeable but mixes well here. Dry finish. Allagash greatness."
"I'm guessing the keg at the party was an earlier vintage, as there wasn't much of the barrel flavor noted by many other reviewers. It took about half a glass before I started to perceive appreciable oakiness. I'd be curious about comparing my experience to that from a fresh bottle."
"D - The drinkability is seriously high for such a high abv beer - 10%. I have probably not had a more drinkable beer of its strength, the flavor of the oak aging pushes the beer along and never gets in the way of the other components. Lots of belgian yeast character - a Must Try to me!"
"I had this beer about a year ago and remembered it being good, but, wow, this is an excellent beer, probably my favorite from Allagash. It has so many things going on but they all seem to merge together perfectly. Superb beer."
"Pours dark brown to black with a cream-colored head. The aroma is awesome with Belgian yeast, malt and some chocolate. The flavor is roasted malt, yeast, oak and some chocolate and alcohol. I may also get some vanilla, but it is faint if it is there. Medium-thick, creamy mouthfeel with low carbonation. A great beer."
"Some of the best beers in the world are marvels of balance, Westmalle Tripel and Chimay Blue come to mind. Odyssey belongs with them in the pantheon of world class beers."
"D - Wow might leave a 5 here but the price is a bit prohibative, either way a must have!!"
"Overall, this is probably one of the best beers I have had by Allagash. Nice looking, decently complex flavor and smooth body. I would have enjoyed a little more oak presence, but I respect that they kept it subtle. For the price I'm not sure if I would pick this up again, but I would be interested in trying an aged version at some point."
"I tend to go through little stints of gravitating toward certain styles without really realizing it, and the last few months it has been towards strong Belgian dark ales. Allagash Odyssey comes out a nice dark brown, with lovely ruby hues at the bottom of the glass. Not much heading, but a decent amount of lace sticks around. Nose is nice mix of dark fruit....figs, dates, plums, things of that nature. The plum character really shines through in the taste, with the bourbon also coming in to compliment things. Mouthfeel is beautifully balanced, and one of the beer's best characteristics. It has a fairly large body, but does not come off overdone at all. Drinking this is far too easy. It is tough not to chug this stuff. My final comments are that it took me way too long to try this beer from Allagash (one of their best IMO) and that it is just begging to be paired with a whole slew of rich dishes."
"D - I'm not big on oak aged beers but this one works. It's interesting and complex."
"Drinkability: Is almost 5 years too long for a beer like this? I wonder what it's like fresh, because I can't compare the two. As I said, it seems like one of the big things is the carbonation factor, where it didn't hold up as much as I expected, which was evident from the initial to the last pour. It still has legs, don't get me wrong, but I feel like it's lost a step from what I can imagine a fresh batch tastes like. Though I still enjoyed it, maybe 5 years was too long, and I hoped for more."
"For 10% this guy is deadly. The sweet isn't overwhelming and the viscous mouthfeel makes for a quickly disappearing drink. Hats off to Allagash for making a tremendous and affordable beer. One of my favorites!"
"Drinkability?: I just finished a 750 ml bottle. Too bad there isn't a store I can get another open at 1:37am"
"D-very tasty, extremely well hidden alcohol content, great mouthfeel, very good sweetness!"
"tasted 12/09 bottled 10/06. Hints at butter and jam on the nose. Tastes malty, caramel and mildly sweet. A bit of vanilla from the oak aging is evident and adds to the complexity. Very drinkable for the style, it hides it's alcohol content very well. Flavor has no sharp edges, the beer aged well. No trace of hops. Solid mouthfeel and it's relatively dry despite very little bitterness."
"Okay, finally succumbed to the $20+ price tag on this one. Worth it. Poured dark brown with a squatty off-white head with good retention. Solid lacing, even in the goblet. Rich, cocoa and wood aroma. Slightly smoked, some tobacco, and some leather, but not nearly enough to overwhelm the softer fruits and malt. Velvety mouthfeel with low carbonation and a long finish. Taste of English brown bread, caramel, and plums as the base. More cocoa and vanilla as the beer warms. Molasses, bourbon, and oak are always there, but very subdued. Much, much better done than the Curiex in terms of balance."
"i would recommend when chilled to let sit at room temp for 15 minutes before popping. maintain the carbonation and let the palate expand."
"Great malty and dark fruit aroma. Great color and decent flavor. I will get this again."
"If you have the chance to try this one I highly recommend it."
"This is a good BSDA. Allagash continues to make good quality Belgian styles, they just never seem to blow me away. Very much worth a try, just not my favorite of the style."
"Overall the beer is ok, drinkable but nothing special or distinguihable."
"A great beer fresh. I can't wait to see what some older bottlings are tasting like right now."
"Overall, worth a try if you like the style and enjoy barrel-aged beers... but not quite worth getting more than one bottle of."
"Delicious, complex, and warming on a chilly November day."
"Had on tap at the Brick House Pub. The beer is dark brown colored with a light tan head that laces in transient wet streams. The aroma is really complex, it seems they crammed everything possible into this beer. The strongest note is chocolate, with lots of berries and fruit, some sweet malty aspects too. The beer tastes way strong, sweet and estery, maybe some real fruit was steeped in here, plums or figs or something similar, a little roasted malt, and some burning alcohol holds it all together. This is too big to be anything but a sipper, but it's a really good one."
"Overall this is a very good BSDA that is even better thanks to the barrel-aging. Another nicely done BA beer by Allagash and one that's well worth a shot."
"the cork comes off with no real pop. the body is almost black, no sight of turbidity, the head is reluctant to form and has a light off white colour, maybe cream coloured. the nose is lacking potency and a few elements (no real spiciness or alcohol). the taste is nothing special; I would just go for th trappistes instead of bothering with thi brew. the taste is almost slightly cola-infused, with a light fruitiness, good malts, and some alcohol. the body is well carbonated and a hair light, but all in all it is a drinkable belgian."
"Pours a very dark brown colored body, with a big creamy tannish color head. Lasting. Fruity aroma, some dark fruit, and some lightish fruit too. Some fig, and some alcohol too. Some roasted notes, and maybe some chocolate. Very strong aroma, kind of funky. Roasty, woody taste. Some wood taste, probably the oak barrel. Some smoke too. This could age in taste very well. Very carbonated. Not sure I really like the taste. A little harsh now, maybe in a few months or years it would taste better."
"D-Good stuff. All in all rather light feeling for a 10%+ brew. Not over the top at all but certainly tasty nonetheless."
"Creamy malty body with lots of estery dark fruit notes, especially raisin, prune, plum, and dark berries with lots of peppery zest, chocolate malts and earthy oak. Very smooth and quaffable with hints of grape and cherry dark fruit. Very nice balance of dark fruit and chocolate malt. The ABV is excellently balanced without a trace of alcohol warmth making this beer extremely quaffable. Sweet dry finish. Excellent!"
"Picked this up during the vagabond release, 2009 vintage. First off, this is one of the smoothest beers I've ever had the pleasure of drinking. It uses the oak beautifully to smooth out the 10.4 alcohol without taking on that strong vanilla flavor many over-oaked beers do. My only complaint is that I wish the flavor was more complex."
"Overall, a pretty good beer. A little different than expected, especially after taking a nice whiff of the aroma. As stated above, lots of complex things, but what really threw me off was the vinous characteristic in the beer. At first it didn't really mesh all that well, but after warming up a bit it became somewhat cohesive. A very interesting beer to say the least."
"Cheers!"
"D: Good, but not as good as I expected, but another solid brew from Allagash and one I's certainly have again."
"A gift from my wife for my birthday. A September 2008 bottle that I've been dying to get into. Pours a deep amber, almost maroon color with deep red highlights. Smallish head that dissolves quickly. Nose is enormous dried fruit, maybe prunes in particular. Oak presence. Chocolate and caramel malt. Some alcohol hints. Flavor is similar, even bigger. Huge fruit, chocolate. Raisins and prunes again, and stronger oak than before. Some dirtier roasted malt in there too. Really an absolutely delicious beer. Body is fine and carbonation is fairly mild, smooth, good for the style. Overall, a delicious beer that I would have frequently were it not for the price."
"Oh Allagash, I've wanted to try a beer from this brewery for a while now. Odyssey did not disappoint. The Chimay goblet may have though. There was very little head from this pour, though my buddy's glass had more head. The lack of head was disappointing, but there was lacing that continued to form around the glass, a detail I particularly love. I was a bit cold when I was drinking this, so the smell was moderately hidden from me. As I warmed up the smell became more noticeable, it had a powerful sort of smoky, wooden quality to it that was truly wonderful. The look of the beer is a dark brown, in which I could see my reflection perfectly in the glass. If I could draw, I'd do my self portrait in this beers reflection. This beer is the perfect sipper! I found it actually amazingly difficult to put down; I just couldn't put it down. The play between the yeast, malts, mixed in the oak barrels is just amazing. A lot of beers have been brewed in oak barrels before, but not at the level of expertise that Odyssey was."
"Had this beer on tap at Great Lost Bear. This beer was absolutely stunning upon first taste. It is a deep mahogany color and very rich in taste. It is deep, complex, and malty sweet. Its flavor is best savored alone, as other beers at the same time seemed to overwhelm it surprisingly easy. This said, there is a lot of sugar in this beer, it was almost surpy in consistency. Definetly a great beer, one of Allagash's finest. I would love to see how this one ages, almost port-like."
"Drinkability is great. I can't get this here and as such I'm sad that this will probably be the only time I have this. Easy to drink, great to taste, fantastic as a desert beer or warmer. Freakin' fantastic, get it if you can."
"Bottom line: Great looking brew with a nose that will grab your interest from your first whiff, for sure, the splendiferous taste, the lightish but smooth mouthfeel, and the exceptional drinkability....all in all, this brew just blew me away!"
"M/D: Medium to full body, carbonation is low. Drinability is decent. High alcohol but never overwhelmingly so, a big beer that drinks lighter. A solid beer, but one I think may be even better fresh."
"Another fine offering from Allagash."
"Drinkability: One of the more impressive brews Allagash has released; this beer has tremendous complexity and is very enjoyable"
"Drinkability: About as good as I'd hoped and expected. A pleasant, drinkable, flavorful, interesting Belgian dark, fruity and malty and everything in between. The 10.0% is noticeable only around the periphery, and adds a faintly cognac/sherry like quality that's more refined than distracting or unpleasant, though I will acknowledge that it catches up with you after some time. All in all, though, this one's very nice, benefits from the barrel aging, and is something I'd be glad to try again. I will say that it probably doesn't merit the price I normally see it going for (~$15-18), so I'm very glad I got it for $11 at Green's, always the best value for beer in the South."
"not bad at all. quite drinkable despite richness, complexity and high ABV. a very creative effort, giving a bold ""american"" accent to the belgian tradition. i just wish there wasn't that hint of watered-down character in the middle of the flavor, unfortunately in almost every big sip i took where i paid attention. would've gotten a 4.5 in taste otherwise. will certainly seek this out again though, and maybe a different batch will prove to be even richer."
"D - This beer was one to remember, and I really hope I do, the taste of this beer is something that magnifies with each and every sip, I cannot wait to get some more"
"Creamy body is well carbonated. Impressive offering from allagash."
"D - I am not sure I can finish this. It's really a dominant flavor."
"A: The color of an iced tea, the thinnest layer of wispy foam, signs of sticky lace along the edges - 4.25, A: Definite signs of oak (smells like French oak), what I perceive as chocolate pudding, some muddled sweetness from a sizeable malt base, slightest sign of citrusy hops - 5.00, T: Not an easy beer to get my arms around, quite boozy but not in an off-putting way, lots of overripe dark fruits - some plums to a prune juice, sugary dates - 4.25, M: Very creamy with lots of lingering ability - 4.50, D: This beer was made for an oak barrel, the 10.3% might limit the drinkability but one I would enjoy again - 4.25"
"A very nice Belgian Strong Dark Ale that comes pretty close to rivaling the Chimay Blue."
"Bottled Sept 2008; drunk Apr 2009. This poured a hazy mahogany with some light tan head. It smelled like roasted barley and oak with some sweet caramel and bready yeast, along with some coffee and cream, and a hint of aged cheddar. It tasted like rich roasted barley and creamy yeast and oak, with some molasses and coffee. Surprisingly malty without as much hops or wild Belgian yeast. It was watery with some smooth carbonation, and had a mild bitter aftertaste. Overall this was an excellent beer. It was delicate but robust, and was very smooth and easy to drink. It was a bit hot, but the alcohol wasn't too strong. It would probably age very well. All in all I had no complaints about this beer, other than I wish it wasn't quite as expensive. But it's worth it, even if just to try once. Every sip was rewarding. Solid brew."
"Poured into my tulip glass. Very,very dark with just a faint red glow when held up to the light. It had a limited head that quickly wisped away. The wonderfully complex aroma was full of beautiful malt characteristics and fruit. And the taste. Oh my! The taste is divine. Plum and raisin and chocolate and just an amazing collection of sweet and earthy flavors with the oak just sort of mellowing or melding the flavors together. For such a big beer the alcohol was not discernible and the mouthfeel was remarkably smooth and creamy. I wasn't sure what to excpect, but I know what I got. An absolutely fantastic beer that my only regret is that I had but just the one. Now I begin my search to acquire more."
"D: Incredibly drinkable. Very nice beer all around."
"Feel and Drinkability: Feels perfect, there isn't anything that could be done to this beer to make it any better feeling. It has just enough dryness to compliment the oak character and enough of the opposite to give some real life and lasing flavor to the brew. Carbonation is low and delicate, just enough to let you know that its there. Body is perfect for what the rest of this beer is, I'd say heavy but its not really there, not medium either or medium heavy....Hmmm...well they don't get much better than this...Hey, when you can't exactly describe it thats a good thing, it means its unique and that it is in turn very special and no others are quite like it. This is what I look for in beer. Something that really catches me off guard that is a challenge...this is that. This beer is great, if you can find it pounce on that!"
"This beer is certainly a winner, and I'm glad I opened it up today. It will certainly make an evening of watching Tiger et. al. even better."
"A great beer overall, and surprisingly drinkable for the style -- the aftertaste is more nutty than alcoholic. I find the red fruit esters to be very distinctive and hard to name. It would be nice to cultivate the yeast for homebrewing purposes."
"Highly recommend this beer. It certainly lives up to the hype that I expected out of this series, after trying the Curieux. It is just all around, a phenomenal beer!"
"Fruitiness is also the dominant flavor, mostly sweet, but finishing dry. Oak, vanilla, figs, plums, raisins, candy, peppery notes. It keeps changing, and it keeps getting better. An absolute masterpiece, I wish I had more."
"D: Tasty."
"Drinkability: Decent, nowhere near the top of the Allagash offerings though."
"Overall a very nice beer I'll try to stock up on."
"Moderately light carbonation, medium bodied."
"Off the tap at American Flatbread this fine spirit was a nearly opaque black with a head of mocha-like foam. The retention as a skim that became a collar was so-so and the lacing spotty. The aroma was a soft but inviting mix of oak, toasted malt and spices. The flavors were bold and complex, however. I tasted the alcohol heat and some esters, oak, tart hops, citrus rind and bitter coffee all punctuated by a spiciness. Similar to a cognac. The alcohol was fairly well hidden but the flavors seemed to compete with rather than compliment each other. Though it started semi-sweet the finish on the coffee note was bitter. The mouthfeel was good, the carbonation soft and the body medium."
"The only reasons to slow me down are the ^abv and the co$t. Otherwise, I could drink alot of this."
"Complex and complete, this brew exceeds my high expectations. If you like strong Belgian ales, get your hands on this beer now!"
"A GREAT BEER HERE> pours a dark brown with a thin tan head. Aroma of caramel, dark fruit, and a boat load of malt. Smooth body, alcohol % well hidden. Flavor is of tasty maly and rasiony dark fruit. The oak is there in both the flavor and aroma. Great stuff, I enjoyed it and look forward to another."
"Unbelievably drinkable for a dark Belgian-style offering this high in alcohol. Strong flavors with a very nice balance. I'm not quite a fan of all of the flavors, but this is certainly a well-crafted ale."
"Pours a two-finger cream head that fades slowly to a ring leaving some lace. Totally black color. Medium carbonation and medium-heavy bodied. Raisin/malty nose. Flavor is sweet, raisin, hints of oak. The high ABV is hidden. Bottled Jan 2008. Over the top but worth trying at $17.00 for a 750ml bottle from a Tully's Beer & Wine Wells, ME."
"Split a 750 ml w/ a few friends. Pours out pretty black but when held to the light looks more like a dark ruby. Fairly modest head, minimal lacing. The aroma reminds me of chocolate covered cherries in a major way...and definitely some oak in there too. Flavor is very similar to the smell, but some raisin flavors too maybe. Oak is very prominent but not overpowering at all. There is some weird synergy with all the flavors here and I can't quite describe it, but I am in awe. The taste is very complex and the best adjective I can use to describe it is 'deep'. Definitely worth seeking out and would definitely love to have some more of this."
"Notes - There is so much going on here, and it is all played out in such a subtle way, that my palate may not be able to really grasp it fully. Delicious, and a beer I will revisit down the line."
"A truly stellar beer; a must for Belgian lovers. Highly recommended!"
"Drinkability isn't too high, this is an intense beer that is a very slow sipper. Couple that with the $15 price tag and that fact that this year's vintage was only 600 cases, and you're talking special occasions only. Much unlike Candyman, which I can listen to all day, particularly this rendition! As the old man I've become, I've realized my number one occupation is no longer taking women from their men - but I was still born in the desert and raised in a lion's den!"
"Good standout brew."
"Notes from 4/24/05"
"The aroma is very wooden and earthy with toasted malt, yeast, maple bacon, whiskey, brown sugar. The appearance is dark brown with a one finger head. The flavor is like the aroma with a touch of chocolate. The palate is thick. I like it but it's just to wooden for me."
"Overall: I liked it"
"drinkability is good. nice balance. the oak adds a nice extra dimension to it. looking forward to seeing how this one changes with time."
"Pours a cloudy reddish brown, almost rusty, medium sized tan head forms, drops down to a thin layer and ring, some decent lacing on the glass. Smell is wacky, raisins, butterscotch, grapes, oak, very fruity, vanilla, yeasty bread, light bit of spice, the wood is very prominent and well done. Taste is similar, very fruity, brown sugar, wine, bread, lots of wood, yeast, alcohol, vanilla, cherries and wild berries, caramel, quite nice. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium to high carbonation, very nice stuff, complex and easy to drink for its ABV. Glad I have another in the cellar!"
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- The perfect mouthfeel is not a score I give out readily, as it must be truly earned. This is sublime in all aspects, from the initial bright tingle through the creamy, throat-coating swallow. This example of a wood aged beer is without a doubt the best I've yet tried, it is a beer to savor and share with friends for a special gathering."
"Poured into my St. Bernardus Watou glass a very very nice brown color, very nice carbonation, awesome thick/creamy one-finger plus off-white head, tons of thick/creamy sticky lacing left behind. Then nose is malty, with some yeast, plums, figs, and raisins, very nice notes of Oak. The taste is sweet, malty, yeasty, with some nice dark fruit tones, and with notes of Oak. Full body, the alcohol is hidden very well. Very drinkable, this is an awesome brew, Allagash did a fabulous job with this one, highly recommended. Thanks Joe."
"D: This one goes down easy for 10%, but I've had it once and don't think it's worth the exorbitant price Allagash wants for it."
"D: This is a very strong American BSDA. Full of flavor and outstanding mouthfeel. It is a bit heavy and has a bit too high an ABV for a session brew. However, this is a real taste treat that should be considered for special occassions."
"Fullish in body and silky with drinkability to spare."
"Pours a very dark mahogony with a medium brownish head. Nice looking and much darker than I expected. The smell is pungent with dark fruit,vanilla,oak wood,and roasted malt. The taste is very flavorful with dark fruit, oak wood,vanilla,alcohol,and a carbonation bite thats refreshing. The m/f is medium with the complex flavors mixing very well. For a high alcohol beer this is smooth and very drinkable. Another great beer from one of the top brewers in New England."
"taste is somewhat smooth, chocolate, dark fruits, toffee, some nuts, touch of spice, slight smoke, alcohol well hidden, nice bitter finish."
"An active three finger foam head is deep tan in color and fades leaving rocky scattered lace. Body is really just about pure black showing just hints of ruby brown on the edges. Nose is soft but has tones of phelonic vanilla, honey and sweet toffee like malt. Enters the mouth big rich bold and loaded with flavor. Complex waves of rich almost burnt malt, vanilla, sweet cream and spicy crust. Almost like a fresh warm biscuit with butter and honey. So smooth on the palate. A tingling spice feel is on the back of the tongue. Mouthfeel is very pleasant and full. A complete joy to drink from start to finish."
"Truly, a magnificently crafted beer."
"This is my first Allagash brew and I'm awfully impressed..terrific brew all the way around.."
"Pours a dark brownish red in color. A decent half inch of head on the pour, but that doesn't last. Decent amount of carbonation forming in a ring atop the beer. Smell is heavenly. Dark cherries, plum, oak, vanilla, and some light bourbon. Taste is incredible. More of the dark fruit there with the barrel aging complimenting everything quite well. A definite sipper, but that's the way this beer should be. Great beer."
"It's not often that a beer leaves me reasonalby without words to describe it. My only regret about this beer is that I don't have two more to drink in 2010 and 2012 . . . yet. Back to the store!"
"The best Allagash beer I have encountered thus far."
"Outstanding. An excellent beer from Allagash."
"D - A very enjoyable and flavorful beer. The dark fruit in the nose is unusually nice, and the smooth dark flavors coat the mouth nicely without ever overwhelming the palate. One of the better beers I have had from Allagash, this is capable of standing up against classic quadruples like Rochefort 10 and Chimay blue."
"Pours a maple syrupy brown with a bit of viscocity. Very faint, tan head that recedes quickly. The aroma is a rich maple syrup, vanilla, and slightly roasted wood. The taste starts ith a strong vanilla maple syrup flavor cool. The flavor slowly ges more fruity and woody as it warms. Well integrated alcohol until it gets a warm. The delicate fruits and wood slowly degrade to a very boozy brandy. Great palate, though. Even when it gets warm, great warmth and sliky smooth syrups."
"A perfect sipping/dessert beer. Ended up having another later in the evening and was still in love with it, although more than that may have been pushing it."
"a delight to drink, definately an ale I would reserve for after a fine meal, or just to relax and take in."
"D - Not sure I can drink this beer on a consistent basis because, well, the beer isn't very consistent from smell, to taste, to mouthfeel."
"Have not had many brew from Allagash, heard this was one of their best and I had to try it in order to find out for myself, not bad but not exceptional either, would drink again, recommended"
"Pours a deep deep ruby color with a white head that has just a touch of gray. Good and fluffy with good retention. Nose is of caramel dried fruit with some spice, and a bit of apple. Taste follows. Thick dark fruit, caramel, spice, licorice, some vanilla and molasses. Very sweet belgian candy sugar. A slight sour note on the finish. A bit thin in the mouthfeel department, slick in the throat. Drinkability is good, but this one is way too sweet to have more than one. Overall a great brew by allagash. I would like the mouthfeel and texture to be a little bit thicker, but they are quite good as they are. I am really impressed with their belgian style brews lately, IMO they are without a doubt one of the best belgian style breweries in the united states. Good beer."
"A pleasure to enjoy slowly to cap off the evening."
"Overall a bit disappointed after having the Interlude, I was expecting something as great as that. Still an above average Belgian ale though, albeit a bit boozy, might need to age a bit to simmer down."
"Those people at Allagash sure know what to do with some malt, hops, yeast, and an oak barrel! Another great entry in this line-up. Pours dense brown-black with a creamy tan head, almost like a nitro head. Aromas are subtle, some Belgian floral and oak. Flavors of roast, subtle Belgian floral funk, oak, and a slightly boozy sweetness. Finishes with a pleasantly sharp roast floral quality. Actually reminds me of a Belgiany version of DFH Palo Santo Marron. Delicious, excellent."
" 10%? This went down like an ESB Very drinkable."
"I didn't know what to expect from this beer, but I was still surprised."
"Considering that this is an oak aged beer, I was disappointed by its lack of overall smoothness. Oddly, this beer seemed to contain more of the roasty maltiness associated with a porter or a stout than the phenolic fruitiness found in most Belgian strong ales. This is definitely a unique beer yet I do not feel it is one of the better examples of the style."
"Drinkability: I enjoyed it, but I'm not going to lie to you, my friend really disliked this one. I hope this bottle of Odyssey hasn't formed an irreparable rift in our long-standing friendship."
"Overall a pretty good brew. Alcohol comes on a little harsh, not overpowering. Plenty of oak and dark fruit flavor."
"A nice Belgian dark, but nothing to special, the barrel ageing is only mildly noticeable."
"Perfection in a glass."
"Overall drinkability is reasonable. Strong alcohol present in nose, taste, and feel detracts from enjoying this one more. Pleasant taste is not too sweet or fruity, with a dry/dark/warm overall tone, setting it apart from some other versions of the style. As it decants, warms, and sits exposed to oxygen it begins to evolve in character. I definitely like this beer, but it seems to need a little refinement."
"750ml bottle bottled January 2008. Pours an almost opaque dark brown with ruby-red highlights and about an inch of light-tan head. Smells fruity (dates, citrus) with some chocolate, vanilla, wood... Tastes like chocolate, date, wood, some citrus, coffee, hints of bourbon (I think)... Wow. A plethora of different flavors all playing in harmony. Rich full mouthfeel with ample carbonation to keep it drinkable. Alcohol is present only in warming, but not in mouthfeel or flavor. Very drinkable, especially for a beer of its size (abv as well as flavor). Phenomenal. Definitely Allagash's best product, at least that I've tried thus far, and quite possibly the best beer I have ever tried."
"Actually, this beer seems like something Lost Abbey would put out. It's good, but not great."
"Nice brew that pushes the boundaries. Allagash is good stuff."
"Aftertaste is sweet dark malt but clean, none the less."
"Notes: Excellent stuff, the best Allagash beer I've had to date."
"Not Allagash's best sample, and in my opinion, definitely not worth the price paid for..."
"This is a very rich and satisfying brew. I don't know whether I could have several of these, but one is definitely a great experience."
"D- My overall impression is that this is another Belgian Strong Dark Ale. They seem to all taste very similar with all the flavors blended together and not much really popping out to impress my tastebuds. I don't think I would have noticed the oak barrel notes if I wasn't looking for them. But it is a good solid beer."
"There was a bit of an off white ring around the top of the dark brown/ruby colored body on this beer. Very fruity nose, plums and some orange, with a hint of vanilla and some alcohol. The taste is a complex layering of many flavors, oak, vanilla, plum, black pepper, and malty goodness. The mouthfeel seems to change, it starts out thick and glyceryne like and then the tight carbonation gives it a nice dry finish. The flavor of the burbon really hits at the finish. I need to get another one or two these and see what it will do in a year or five."
"D: Solid american attempt at the beglian strong dark. one of the best dark out there..."
"Poured into an oversized wine glass. It poured dark reddish brown, with little carbonation. The smell was molasses, malt and herb spiciness. The taste was fantastic, with molasses like malt, belgium spicy yeast, chocolate coming through. The oak was not overpowering at all. A fantastic beer, although very price ($17.99 in SF). The limited availability and price would be the only thing keeping me from adding this to my regular purchases."
"*note to self: Might be time to try the 06 in the cellar soon."
"Bottled January, 2008- cases bottled, 600. I bought this from Decatur Wine and Spirits. Definitely could use some aging. It is pretty tasty right now, but the taste of new oak is pretty strong. If you like that, drink it now. If not, age this for a year or more. Since I've never had it before, I couldn't wait and decided to try it fresh. Pours as about a dark a brown as you can get before shifting to black. Fairly thin head, but there is barely any head fading. The whole cap sticks around for the life of the beer. There is also some spotty lacing. Smell is oak dominated, with some subtle typical Belgian strong dark notes of raisins, candi sugar, toffee, and spice in the background. The taste becomes more integrated as the beer warms and opens up, but there is still a lot of new white oak in the flavor. Spicy oak notes, woody, vanilla, and quite a tannic bitterness that echoes through the whole thing. At this point, the raisin, prune, candi sugar, and toffee play second fiddle to the oak bomb. That being said, as with a great wine, the early oak and tannins predict greatness in the future of this beer. With some aging, these components should mellow and become more seemlesly integrated. Also, although the oak is prominent, the tannins are the star, and this beer is not a vanilla bomb. This makes the whole flavorr profile more complexx and interesting. Mouthfeel is full, creamy, and quite tannic. Challenging and complex. The alcohol is eextremely well hidden and as big in flavors as this beer is, it is still a pleasure to suss out the various components of this brew. A prime candidate forr cellaring."
"Again this is an easy drinker for a strong ale. This is a well-balanced and top notch Belgian Dark. Highly recommended..."
"Very dark brown, but still clear and transparent, this beer had mahogany edges with brilliant ruby highlights. The pour produced a tight, light tan cap that settled slowly to a thick ring and there was spotty lacing throughout. The barrel really contributed a lot of character to the aroma. Toasty malt and toffee were prominent, with some vanilla, oak and booze following. A little buttery smelling too. Mellow bitterness with a fruity backbone, flavours of figs and other dried fruits were quite forward. Sweetness was similar to brown sugar or molasses, a little buttery with a bit of alcohol in the finish. Low carbonation, creamy bubbles and medium bodied with a bit of dryness and warmth, plus a bit of stickiness. This stuff is dangerously easy to drink. Fairly mellow and very balanced, it was complex yet not overbearing."
"Overall this was an excellent brew and one of the best I have had from Allagash. A superb barrel aged beer this combined the best of what they can do. I would gladly by another one day. Really a nice selection here that I would have to recommend."
"Oct 2006 bottling. Pours very dark brown with big red highlights and a cafe-au-lait colored head that leaves ample lacing all the way down the glass. Aroma is bourbon, oak and chocolate, no hops. Flavor is smooth oak, malt, chocolate and dark fruits (raisins and figs) with balancing but almost unnoticed hops. Finish is all dark malt and oak, but with hints of bourbon. Body is on the high side of medium."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied and smooth with good steady carbonation. Not too heavy it is quite a decadent brew. After nearly 2 years this is drinking superb. I only wish I had more bottles around. Another acheivement from Allagash. Seek it out."
"750ml corked and caged bottle witha bottling date of October 2006. Pours a deep mahagony brown with a 2 finger head and very nice lace. Hard to get a decent aroma - I'm brewing right now so I will give it a average. Fruity, earthy, a bit smokey and roasty. Ok hop bitterness cosidering the style. Alcohol fairly well hidden. Smooth and very drinkable. I'm glad I aged this for a year. Nice beer."
"""Poured gently into a wide mouth glass"". An almost opaque dark brown color with red hues around the edges. A shallow wispy light tan head that fades fairly quickly with little lacing in its wake. The smell is primarily the bourbon aging/vanilla that all but masks a fig-like dark fruit and light roast malt aroma. Medium body with a heavy bourbon character and a nice light carbonation to the mouth. The bourbon aging contributes to a spicy finish that lingers significantly. I didn't realize that its a wheat ale. I imagine that contributes to the drier, verses fruitier character. I really had a good time with this one. A lot there to consider. Glad that i had the opportunity to sample it."
"D: I wanna take this beer behind the middle school and get it pregnant. I thought that Curieux and Interlude were the zenithes of brewing but this one is a real sock-knocker-offer."
"Medium bodied, not too heavy or boozy, although the alcohol is felt. A+ for this barrel-aged offering from Allagash..."
"M&D: smoothly-textured and softly-fizzy, this full-bodied dark ale somehow tastes very light, without showing traces of high-octave alc. at all. Two years of further ageing in the bottle has made this oak-aged ale a balanced, easily approachable and very delicious nectar. Somehow the flavour also reminds me a lot of some English old ales; so, to me, this can be fairly described as a cross b/w the Belgian and English styles of strong old/dark ales. Highly recommended!"
"Drinkability- Deciptively drinkable, I could finish up this bottle in a hurry and then find out that it's 10%abv afterward. Nice."
"This is a damn fine beer! Very well done and extremely enjoyable. The best of the BA series by a long shot."
"Great drinkability, this is one to savor and analyze. One of the most enjoyable brews of this style I've tried recently."
"D- I really like this. Seems like everything is perfectly placed. Great brew!"
"The beer poured a deep black with a decent head that slowly diminished. The aroma was a unique blend of dried fruits and oak. The taste was similar with the flavors playing off each other very nicely. The beer was medium bodied and the alcohol was well hidden for a 10% brew. This is a truly unique beer."
"Overall a nice cellaring experiment, now i just need to try a fresh bottle!"
"It does have some chocolate notes that I picked up this time to add to complexitity. Body is still creamy, but yet sharp. Alcohol sharpness, oak/vanilla and vinuous (with some sourish grapey notes), in a red wine way, dominate. An interesting brew - a slow sipper. I enjoyed this bottle more than I did the first one I reveiwed. I noticed a few more subtlties and some more creaminess, but still not overly thrilled."
"Allagash Odyssey is a toasty, oak flavored sweet beer, and both very well balanced and surprisingly drinkable. It's not a bit harsh or overly oaked, as some barrel-aged beers are wont to be. A pleasant surprise and a refreshing change of pace from in your face, big beers. Give this to your wine-snob uncle who claims beer is beneath him. Highly recommended, but to buy it too often would spoil the fun."
"Tastes of licorice plus grapes and cinnamon spice. Very tasty with a complimentary mouthfeel. Alcohol note present as it warms. Feels smooth and tarty with a subtle carbonation that doesn't overpower the palate & complements the flavor. Definately one I'll be having again, despite the steep price. It's worth it."
"What a brew!"
"Yet another winner from Allagash. It's actually not quite as complex as I usually like a BSDA to be...but taking into account the uncommon use of a wheat base for the style gives it a few more points in my book."
"Pours very dark but quite clear, with surprisingly light amber highlights and a surprisingly tenacious tannish head. Rich aroma of caramel, vanilla spice, some smoky meat notes and light coffee-and-cream. On the palate, rich and perfectly balanced flavors mix with excellent carbonation and smooth barrel-derived tannins. Very creamy in mouthfeel and flavor, along with some slightly sweet nutty, coffee and cream notes and slight twang of acidity. Some alcoholic hotness, but it serves mainly to activate the other flavors and lengthen the finish rather than distracting you. Overall, this is a great beer, and one of the better barrel-aged Belgians I've had. The oak barrel notes aren't too sweet, too forward, or too cloying; instead they just add some great nutty and vanilla-y notes to an already tasty Belgian brew. Excellent beer."
"Pours a deep reddish brown color with a large head of tan/brown bubbles. Vanilla and oak in the nose. Taste is roasty with hints of bourbon, tobacco, wood, and a hint of plums. Rather thin mouthfeel. Moderately dry aftertaste. The bourbon comes out more at the end. Enjoyable and different, but not something I would choose often. I think this could use some aging."
"The abv is evident after a few sips and it makes you wonder whether or not the beer was soaked in used bourbon barrels. The barrels were newly toasted American oak so the caramelized bourbony flavors are all derived from the beer combined with the oak. Nice."
"I did not know what to expect as this is my first oak aged beer. Immediately after popping the cork I was thinking this smells like sherry. Lots of vanilla in the nose too. It poured a deep brown almost cola color. Taste was sherry like with some hints of vanilla and a nice bitterness in a very long finish. This is not a brew to quaff after mowing the lawn, it's perfect for late night sipping before bed. I'd imagine it'd be great after a meal."
"I've come to conclude that the Allagash barrel series are all fantastic. I can't wait to have this after a couple years in the cellar, once the alcohol dies down a bit. Truly a fantastic beer, and well worth the $14. Highly recommended."
"Drinkability: A very interesting oaked beer, enjoyable, rich and unique."
"Allagash proved long ago that they're one of my favorite breweries in all the world. No other American brewer so reliably recreates the classically Belgian styles, and oftentimes meets and surpasses the best that that country has to offer. Simply put, Odyssey is an outstanding BSDA and is one of the best beers of any style that I've ever had the pleasure to drink."
"Oak is definitely present in this one, with flavor characteristics reminiscent of a dry chardonnay. Plenty of vanilla accompanied by a mouth warming alcohol presence are the first flavor sensations. A semi-sweet chocolate presence creeps in towards the end of the sip as well, but this one is mainly vanilla due to the oaking. Interesting, though not spectacular, I'd like to see how this ages."
"Drinkability- Overall a very quality brew with a fabulous scent and great flavor. This one will be interesting to taste 5 years down the line....if I only had a bottle...sob :("
"good drinkability in the context of what it is: a sipper. overall a very impressive unique beer that a little bit of age helped to round out."
"This poured with a light, deep-brown head. The beer itself was a deep brown color and the nose gave off an unmistakable smell of bouron whiskey as imparted by its aging in used barrels. The mouthfeel is thin, light, and unobtrusive, whch was somewhat surprising. Both the taste on the tongue and the finish are awash with a bourbon-sweetness, sort of like coconut. I'd like to have Lew Bryson weigh in with his thoughts on this one."
"Dark burgundy color. Coconut and cork aromas, with hints of vanilla, bourbon and fruit. Not much aromas from the actual original brew, but the barrel contribution is vibrant. Flavor is very vinous, with hints of raisins and grapes, chocolate and perhaps a hint of amarone. Hints of bourbon and vanilla as well. Pretty rich, with a nice body to boot."
"If they make it again buy as much as you can find and enjoy!"
"Two thumbs for RealityDeviant for coming through and getting me some!"
"While the oak is not too dominant in this beer, I think that it is a bit too much. There is not enough of the rich beer notes that I would like to see. The malt is too subtle underneath the oak; perhaps a bit of caramel and a certain fullness that I would attribute to malt character. This is certainly drinkable, and I would even want a few more bottles of this to age for a couple of years."
"Very full flavor that holds up--and even improves--as the beer warms. Some tingley spices at first quickly followed by a bit of heat from the alcohol. That licorice I pick up in the nose comes out a bit more in the flavor. Belgian sugars give this beer a thick, dense feel and a sweet tooth. The oak was very subtle and was not the focus in this beer. Very thick mouthfeel that finishes a tad dry. A wonderful, slow-sipping dessert beer."
"This is a sublime beer. It has a dark red-brown color with a moderate-sized creamy head. It has a sweet spicy odor with vanilla undertones as well as some spice. A sweet taste, with a charcoal/smoky flavor. A very good mouthfeel, not too bubbly. I thoroughly enjoyed this beer, and could drink it all night, except its 10.4%ABV precludes this (at least if I want to function the next day)."
"Bottle (February 2005 drank in January 2006): Poured a deep ruby color ale with a quite large off-white foamy head with better then average retention. Aroma of alcohol is detectable with some sweet malt. Taste has definite bourbon presence with some semi-sweet malt. Body is definitely thinner then expected. I was expecting a bit more complexity from this beer  no yeast signature, alcohol taste too evident, thin body."
"D- Crazy Crackers! This has to be, hands down, one of the most flavorful, complex and enjoyable beers I have had in a long time. Allagash makes brewing a quaffable 10% Belgian style beer look simple. Paired this with some hard goat cheese and bunderfleish."
"Drinkability: This is a very big beer. The beer is very well balanced. It has survived almost a year in my cellar. I hope the remaining bottle is as good next year."
"750 mL, corked and caged. Bottled February 2005, 10.4% abv. Glowing mahogany with garnet highlights and a clinging, sand-colored foamy head. Aromas of figs, dried cherries, and prunes, all soaked in vanilla- and orgeat-infused bourbon. Fluffy and light mouthfeel supports a roasted almonds and vanilla bean/date sugar sweetness. Spicy alcohol emerges right before a dry, sugared filbert finish. Brilliantly balanced and highly drinkable for such a rich and full-flavored ale. I can't wait to see what another year or so will do to this. Delicious."
"I've been waiting since February to drink this. I love Allagash brews, but maybe my expectations were too high. Anyway, aroma was about what I'd expected. Definitely could smell oak and vanilla. The oak seemed more pronouned then others have noticed. To me this didn't have the mouthfeel of a Strong Dark Ale. Didn't really notice the alcohol. I brought this to our neighborhood New Year's Eve party as I'm the beer geek in my neighborhood. I thought this was my chance to convert some of them Mick Light drinkers. We had started with a St Bernardus Tripel, which every one enjoyed. ""Wow, this stuff is really good, what else did you bring?"" Unfortunately, the Odyssey didn't go over that well. Maybe it was the oak, but I was underimpressed, as well. Not a bad beer, but not great."
"Poured from a February 2005 (750 ml) bottle. Poured a deep brown/caramel colour -- decent carbonation and a nice head (maintained head for several minutes). Smell is underwhelming -- expecting more -- just hints of vanilla and oak/bourbon with alcohol spiciness. Taste has the base notes of a dubbel acccented with the expected vanilla and oak flavors -- not much else going on. Pretty good mouthfeel and at 10.4% this is a very drinkable beer -- the ABV will sneak up on you. However, the verdict, unfortunately, is that this is less of an Odyssey and more of a (pleasant) three hour tour. Gilligan!"
"It is so refreshing to try an oak-aged beer in which the wood isn't a bat hitting you in the throat. Instead, it's a complimentary note to a soothing sonata of malt, yeast and muted spice. the ABV is bold and brash, but is balanced nicely with the muscular-enough flavor profile. The result is a potent but quite drinkable brew. The bottom line is a bold, well-crafted big beer, and it's well worth every breath you take, every move you make, every sip you take."
"Drinkability is good, smooth easy drinking for 10% alcohol is noticed but feels like it should be there and mingles well with the other flavors. Want to thank merlin48 for sharing this one with me. Bottled in Feb 2005."
"large bottle, caged and corked, dated, numbered, the works. Simply stated this has got to be one of the best brews on the planet. Large, flavorful, strong, complex. Tons of wood, figs, raisins, rum.Words cannot do justice to this flavorful tipple. Get a few bottles, put em away for about 5 years and enjoy, or crack em open tonight and savor this nectar. One of the best brews I've ever had the priviledge of drinking."
"Better drinkability than I expected from a bourbony 10.4% dark ale. Smooth and pleasing, and very well constructed."
"A really good one. Bourbon alcoholly aroma, coca cola colour, lots of lace. But the taste, bourbon more than whiskey, and very drinkable. Went down really well, smooth on the tongue. A great example of wood working, with vanilla coming through. Suitable understated carbonation. A must try."
"Bottled Feb 2005. Great pop on the champagne cork unveiled an amazing nose of oak, peaches, rum, raisins and booze. It poured dark, thick with a nice lather. I took a small sip and it felt like I took a big swig. Huge flavors of oak and bourbon in a rich creamy ale. The sweetness is one of vanilla, peaches and honey which helps balance some of the alcohol burn. This is a serious beer. If you like what Ive described then you will love this but it isnt for everyone. I was going to ding this beer on the drink ability. After I few sips I thought I would only drink half a bottle but after drinking 3/4 of the bottle I wanted more. Once it warmed, a great ale shined through. It paired great with blue cheese and aged Gouda. Thanks to Jetsbeer."
"750ml bottles in February 05. Pours out a very dark brown with a healthy sized light tan head filling the rest of the chalice. Streaky and clumps of lace coated the glass for the most part. Sweet candy sugar and big dark ripe fruitiness hit my nose first. Good amount of spiciness was there as was a bit of dark chocolate. Light alcohol notes as it warmed, very delicious smelling. Taste has a big fruitiness up from with figs and plums with some brown sugar sweetness. A mix of spices is in there but I cant pick any out. Caramel, oak and some bourbon notes all mix flawlessly adding to the incredible taste. As it warmed the alcohol showed its face more but never added negatively to the flavor. One of the best tasting Belgian Dark Ales I have ever had. Pretty thick and creamy body with a bit of a warmth to bit due to the big alcohol. Ridiculously drinkable. With as strong as the alcohol is and the complexity in this brew it went down very easy and I wish I had another bottle to follow it with. Excellent stuff."
"The beer pours a translucent dark brown color with a thick frothy tan head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is awesome. It has a wicked malty scent that boasts of roasted and crystal malts along with a deep whiskey aroma. There is quite a bit of warmth and complexity in the aroma. The taste is great. It has a warming whiskey flavor that is complimented with a complex malt bill. It's roasted and full of Belgian crystal malts; very tastey. The mouthfeel is near perfect. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a damn good beer. The whiskey barrel storage is a great idea. It really adds a whole new flavor to an already solid brew."
"Overall, while this offering from Allagash is decent, the whiskey taste was a deal-breaker for me. I'm not a big fan of beers that carry a bourbon or whiskey flavor in them and this one does. As such, I know of other offerings in the style that appeal to me more."
"Poured a cherry amber color with a small, light tan head that left light lacing on the glass. Aroma of dried fruits, cherries, toasted oak, caramel and alcohol. Taste of vanilla, caramel, earthy yeast, toasted oak, tart cherries and alcohol. This was very nice."
"Even though there is a lot of strength to this, it goes down amazing. It was the perfect beer to relax with after a long day."
"Beer is good. Happy beering."
"Poured into a Rapscallion glass, formed 1 1/2"" of frothy tan head over the garnet-hued brew. Head lasts well due to plentiful bubbling, and lacing is almost a complete coating of heavy foam. Aroma is vanilla, oak notes, and alcohol. Taste is as the nose indicated, but with the strong flavors all melding amazingly well, and none overpowering. Mouthfeel and drinkability, for the style, are incredible, able to go down smoothly and even quickly. Worth the green to give it a try yourself."
"750 ml bottle, corked and bailed. $14 at Wine Warehouse in Charlottesville, VA. Bottling February 2005. Bottle says 10.4% Alcohol by Vol."
"This is wonderful, pure bliss, and quite settling on the nerves."
"What can I say about this beer? It was good, Id drink it again, but for the price its not worth it at all. I paid nearly $14 for this beer, and I know price shouldnt factor in, but for the price I could get a big oak aged beer just as good for half the price. Worth a try, but not worth the price."
"It pours a bad-ass deep dark brown color with a 2 finger head that falls to a chunky coating over top. Very good looking beer. The nose is rather winey. I get rum-soaked raisin, light vanilla, puffs of alcohol, and spiceyness. Wow. Lots going on, but not over the top. The flavor is pretty darn nice. Ny initial taste gave me the impression that it was going to be boring. Just a spicey alcohol-enhanced raisiney fig flavor, but I gave it a minute to show me the full potential. The finish is not as sudden as other brews. It took a good 10 seconds to hit, but the woody, slight vanilla, but mostly just a wood flavor, comes through and lingers. I like it. The feel is a solid moderate with a light to moderate carbonation. I do get alcohol in the flavor and in the nose, but its not offensive. It enhances the experience. For this size and the complexity of nose and flavor, the drinkability is very good. I like it a lot better than the Curieux."
"Corked 750mL bottle poured into a snifter. Pours a very dark brown color with ta tall head that falls slowly and leaves plenty of lacing on the glass. The aroma is very odd - reminds me of sherry, oak, fruit, and a little alcohol. Nice. The flavor has a lot going on. Lots of dark fruityness. Small hints of alcohol and vanilla. Lots of oak character at the end. The alcohol isn't very prominent in the flavor, but it is very warming. Also some fruity sweetness on the finish. The mouthfeel is on the heavy end of medium. Drinkability is really good for the alcohol levels. Very nice beer. Let it warm and it's even better."
"I hope they keep this one around for awhile. Excellent and highly recommended, esp. for bourbon lovers. Bourbon dominates but doesn't overwhelm."
"This is the second time I have opened a bottle of this brew and I definitely enjoy it just as much this time. If you can get one, there is no doubt that you should buy it. Well worth your $$!!"
"after having heard from a couple of people that this was just an awesome beer i just had to have it. i work in a supermarket and i work the beer section i just had to get this. after calling my beer guy i got 2 cases in. after having this i now have a favorite beer. the flavor was just amazing and has the smell of vanilla. i bought a second bottle just to age and cant wait until that is ready to taste"
"Drinkability is very solid but the oak imparts abit too much and really overshadows everything, especailly as the beer warms. A bit to over the top but still a nice beer and obviously impeccably brewed."
"By far the best beer I've had from Allagash. Superb!"
"I like this, and I don't always like my beer this strong."
"May the force be with you."
"Poured out a dark dirt brown with a foamy white head. Left a few strings of lace around the glass after I was done. Smell consisted of dark fruits mostly, along with some vanilla, honey, and a touch of earth and wood way back in the background. No big spices came through which surprised me a little bit. Taste was good. Started out with an assualt of vanilla and honey on the palate, which then mixed with some fruit, and a few hints of spices shine through which made it balance nicely. Mouthfeel was medium with a good creamy texture. This beer is quite dangerous in the drinkability department. Savor this beer, you won't be sorry."
"Cheers"
"Just a touch of sweetness up front. Lovely flavours of vanilla, smokeyness, oak, dark fruit, & nuts. Dry & rustic. Medium-full bodied, robust, but soft carbonation. I imagine this will become quite interesting after a few years in the cellar."
"I would definably put this up against any wine any day. Simply adorable."
"An excellent beer from an excellent brewery."
"Very dark brown to black with mild ruby highlights. It was topped by a uniform cream colored head. Decent carbonation delivers a mild stream of champagne bubbles to the top of the glass. Very neutral aroma. There is vanilla, a little date from the malt, a hint of earth/soil, and a touch of bourbon. The taste is much richer. There is a sweetness of dates and figs up front followed quickly by vanilla, and a bourbon character. The hops show in the middle of the flavor with some orange/citrus. A mild alcohol warming, slick but rich mouth feel lend to a good drinakbility. I think this may be my favorite offering from Allagash."
"The cork pops off with pretty good force. The carbonation shows in the pour really nicely. It is almost an opaque dark, dark brown. In the light there are rich ruby highlights. A 4"" head forms which has a pleasant yeasty aroma. The smell is also malty and oaky, and reminds me of toasted coconuts. There is alcohol in the nose if you really go after it, but it really isn't fuming with it [keywords: good balance]. The taste is like ripe plums, skin and all.. it starts out with a full on sweetness and finishes with a dry, tart astringence. Although this is a drinkable brew, I think you could easily split a 1 pint 9.4 fl oz bottle between two (or more) people, especially with dinner. And speaking of which, this brew does in fact go well with BBQ. I went for some jumbo chicken wings and a glass of Odyssey.. aaahh, sweet!"
"a good spring transitional season beer. like weyerbacher's insanity in some ways, but more drinkable and lighter overall for slightly warmer drinking weather. great beer."
"Allagash's Odyssey burst forth with a richness and complexity that could be likened to an overladen rain cloud dumping itself across the cold dessert floor as part of a fast moving electrical storm at night. It's black body reveals glints of burgundy beneath its inch-high creamy ivory head; and the retention is quite nice, leaving short walls of almost completely solid lace that slowly erode to spots and splashes as you progress through the glass. Vanilla, dark caramel, raisins, and oak greet you in the nose along with some black licorice, a spritz of alcohol, a drizzle of dark chocolate syrup, chickory, some mild brown sugar, and the suggestion of cold black coffee. It's medium bodied and zesty in the mouth before warming to become somewhat airy. The flavor is even more intense than the nose suggests with the addition of some previously hidden yeasty fruitiness and spicy phenolics; and more dried dark fruit. As it warms, it rounds out quite a bit as the alcohol sinks down into its supple maltiness. Roastiness remains in the finish, but it also softens quite a bit as it's awash in dull dark fruit, alcohol, and soft, sweet vanilla. It's enjoyable for sure, but it's 10.4% abv does slow down its drinkability!"
"very well done, I dont recommend more than a snifter's worth, excellent as a digestif with some strong cheese or a really hearty spicy dip of some sort. it could hold its own against powerfull food. this one should age nicely..."
"This will be a keeper. Excellent cellaring potential, where one could expect that perfect 5's across the board could be achieved with time and perfect conditions."
"This strong ale poured a cloudy, brown color with tan foam that settled. The smell was whiskey and malt with some fruitiness, including dried fruit, and some toffee and a bit of alcohol. The taste was malty with flavors of whiskey from the barrel, dried fruit (raisins and prunes), vanilla, and moderate hops. The mouthfeel was smooth but with a crispness, with full body and low carbonation, and with a very nice aftertaste. This was a very nice beer to sip and savor from a snifter."
"Dark brown/ruby near black with a nice head of white foam as well. Belgian lace, up and down the glass. Aromas of wheat, belgian sugar, roasty malts, and vanilla, oak, and bourbon hints amongst others. Taste was big and bold with tons of boozy vanilla, rum, oak, and raisins. Nice. This picks up where the Curieux left off and than takes it to the moon. Mouthfeel is creamny, smooth, and cask-like. Let this one warm up though it was served way too cold off of the taps at Anam Cara. Drinkability was damn good for such a complex, big-ass beer. Wow another masterpiece of Belgian meanderings from our fine friends in Maine."
"Pours a very dark brown, not quite opaque with bits of red shining through around the edges. Not much head to speak of on this beer. Smell is super copmlex. Sweet fig scents accent a very stout-ish ale. It also has a distinctive Belgian spice aroma and yeasty bread characteristics. Taste is all of the above and more. Huge even for the style. You can taste the candied sugar that was used to brew it but it isn't oppressive at all. Hints of alcohol are just barely noticable. Big malt attitude with a spicy hop kick backing it up. Wow. Mouthfeel is velvet smooth. So easy to drink this beer. I can't wait til they bottle this next month but I guess I'm going to have to wait for now. Amazing brew, seek it out at all costs."
