"Overall it is not a bad winter warmer, smell was a little much for me, but other than that above average, would be interesting to taste this aged for five years or so"
""
"A very well done ale."
""
"-overall a great beer first i have had from the company but it was a good beer"
""
""
"Cheers!"

"12 oz bottle poured into a Nonic pint.  Deep brown/coffee-like color.  1.5 finger head that melted quickly with minimal lacing.  Nice aroma hitting on a touch of orange - I didn't pick up on the other spices listed on the label.  Taste:  another reviewer mentioned mustiness which is spot on but unfortunately it was a negative for me.  Overall this one grew on me by the time I finished but the first 8 oz were just OK-- perhaps the 10% ABV was talking down the stretch."

""
"This one is too boozy fresh for me, would like to try it with a few years on it. Not bad, but the booze overpowers the flavors."
""
"The beer is very good"
""
""
""
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a very dark amber color with a 1 inch head. Smell is of fruits, spices. Taste is dark fruits, malts, spices, some alcohol, a bit sweet at the finish. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a good quality beer."
""
""
""
"Remarks:  very nicely done; I love this one"
"Medium  bodied with average carbonation, and a caramel and spice aftertaste.  The alcohol is well hidden for a 10.0 % abv beer. I'm glad I had a chance to try this, and would gladly buy it again."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a pretty solid beer that I think would be better with some age on it."
"I like this.  Interesting and unique.  The spice additions and esp. the fruit add in a way that works well for me.  I think I'll keep this in mind for my own BDSA next fall."
""
""
"Delicious dark fruits, flavors of coriander and orange peel and other spiciness. Sweet but never cloying. Slight warmth of alcohol. Excellent sipper. Perfect winter warmer. Ommegang crafts another winning beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"Long-lasting flavor and a heavy sweetness that sticks to the inside of your mouth. A potent yet drinkable brew. I'll be buying this again next winter."
""
""
""
"I should have read the label more closely."
""
""
""
"Brownish copper in color.  Low-level funkiness on the nose.  Malty and smooth. There were sweet orange peel notes on the finish."
""
""
""
""
"Overall this would pair well with an equally spicy spice-cake. To much going on... flavors are interesting, but they are just not for me. It gets an 82/100 from me."
""
""
""
"Overall:  Goddamn, this is an excellent beer!  I love the spices and the yeast!  It’s absolutely delicious!  I’m getting this beer every year it’s released!"
"O:  Great example for the style, but not hitting the spot."

"O:  Great beer by Ommegang."
"Aroma dark fruit,yeasty, spices, malt, faint citrus, molasses.Taste sweet malt, plums, cloves, caramel, brown sugar,molasses, coriander."
"A little strong, heavy gingerbread mix with a kick at the end. They pushed it to the max. It has it place!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Very pleasant strong dark ale. Powerful coriander notes may stand out a bit too much."
""
"This is a GREAT Belgian dark ale!  I can't say enough about this beer.  It is deep and rich to the pour and strong in spice and warmth.  The perfect beer for the holidays and cold weather.  I'd also see this going well with many of the traditional holiday foods.  It finishes strong, sweet, and warm... This is a GREAT BEER!"

"Strong beer from ommegang. Citrus and orange smell and taste. Filling but not hard to drink. Packs a punch , you'll feel it after you drink it. Had at one mile house nyc"
""
""
"Not that good. Alcohol not balanced well"
""
""
""
""
"Great smell makes my mouth water thinking about it. Give it a try."
""
""
"Adoration by Ommegang Brewery is a good beer, and a great beer if you like coriander.  Personally I do not like that taste.  This Belgian style of beer would be a good choice for those of you that like Blue Moon, one Shock Top."
"Feel is smooth at the front but has a bit of a bite on the finish"
""
""
""
"Overall- Enjoyable sipping beer, very warming from holiday spices, also slightly from lingering alcohol. Citrus notes balance wonderfully off of spices, spicing is not just your typical holiday spices, but also beautiful peppery notes. Great holiday offering."
"O: it's just a tripel it's nothing amazing but it's pretty good "

"My favorite domestic Belgian-style ale, from my favorite domestic brewery. I want to buy a case or two while they are around."
""
""
""
""
""
"This is characterized as a BSDA, but it's like none I've ever tried, from the dark amber color to the mildly bitter bite offsetting the decidedly non-Belgian yeast and caramel, dark fruits, and all of the usual suspects."
""
""
""
""
""

"Belgian yeast, dark malt and Winter spices. Very good."

"O - Complex and elegant.  This bottle has a ""Best By"" date of 7/2016 and really enjoying this one."
"O- This is definitely a big warmer for the winter.  It is pretty boozy, but the hop bitterness and dryness make this boozy beer a lot easier to go down.Lots of really nice juicy fruit flavors and some nice Belgian yeast and spice character for balance."
""
""
""
""
"Like a brown spice cake. Delicious"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: they do well here... wonder what it tastes like without the spices - I'm guessing still somewhat decent, though without as much excitement/depth... I could definitely do a second bottle after this, but I have a thing for malt and spices, so this is hittin that nerve"
""
""
"Tasty, balanced winter ale from Ommegang."

"Reminded me of an old fashioned Christmas"

""
"Overall: A big, boozy, fruity and spicy sipper: Christmas fruitcake."
"A great winter warmer, well worth the price of admission due to its complex flavors."
""
""
""
""
"Belgian yeast esters of pear, bubblegum, and green apple accompany dark, sweet candi sugar and toffee to form the aroma. Flavor is appley and tart, fairly alcoholic, with a toasted, nutty malt backbone. Esters become more complex the more I sip. The high abv isn't hiding well, but the flavor of the esters keep me coming back for more."
""
""
"You want strength? It's here and the warming made itself known from the get go. That was counterbalanced by the wonderful range of flavors and the Belgian nature of this beer that shone through since the spice was understated. Wet, lively, and enjoyable, this is seasonal that deserves to be put in your winter rotation, and I know that it'll be placed in mine with the SN Celebration, Brooklyn BCS, and Anchor Special Ale. Wonderful in every aspect, a beer like this truly enlivens the holiday season. Don't miss out!"
""
"O: Good beer, but I have pretty high standards for this Christmas/Winter BSDA’s/Quads.  Enjoyable, but with so many great examples of the style out there I don’t think its something I will make a yearly staple.  4"
""
"O-  definitely let this one warm up a bit."
"Overall - this beer is released seasonally and I can't think of a reason not to get some every year. Well worth it."
"I really appreciate what Ommegang/Duel have been doing over the last couple of years."

"Very nice strong ale. Like a more refined Kulmbacher EKU 28."
""
""

"Overall one of the best American versions of this style available."
""
""
""
""
"Overall I thought this was a good beer and I thought it was a good example of the style, it seems to be pretty inline with the style and I liked that the brewery calls this a Dark Winter Ale, it's not very dark, but for Belgian standards it kind of is and it goes well with the winter weather.  This beer had good drinkability, it was smooth, a little creamy, crisp, just slightly prickly, the alcohol was hidden well, slightly sticky, not too filling and the taste did a nice job of holding my attention, I think one would be the perfect amount for me, but with how well the alcohol is hidden i wouldn't rule out have two of them.  What I like the most about this beer was how well the different aspect worked with each other, I thought the Belgian yeast worked well with the dark fruit flavors.  What I liked the least about this beer was that more of those toasted malt flavors didn't come through in the taste, but it wasn't a big deal.  I would buy this beer again and I'm interested to see how it ages.  I would recommend this to anyone who likes the stronger Belgian Ales.  All in all I was happy with this beer, now that I've tried it on a fresh palate I think I like it just a little less since I've last had it, but it's still a good beer that I enjoyed drinking and I think it's fitting for the season.  This isn't my favorite Ommegang beer or my favorite beer of the style, but it's not bad in any aspect.  Good job guys, this was a tasty winter seasonal, keep up the hard work."
""

"O: I was a bit underwhelmed by it overall but it's very good. I was expecting a little bit more flavor wise but perhaps I was comparing it unfairly to a Barleywine or Old Ale. It's not as complex as the aforementioned styles, and is more fruity than malty. This is, of course, the major difference in styles of Barleywine to Belgian Strong Dark, and I enjoy those styles a bit more. That being said, it's very good for the style. A great sipping beer for a cold winter night. The warming in the throat and chest mixed with the cidery spice is enough to keep me coming back for more during the season. Good spice, good mixture of flavor, and it's as smooth as could be."

"12oz bottle. Pours a dark hazy rusty brown with a large lasting beige head. Aroma is of sweet caramel malt, brown sugar, some mild banana and fruity notes, spices, a bit of orange peel and sweet alcohol notes. Taste same as aroma, with some, yeast mild and bitterness. Palate is a medium to full body with good carbonation. Finishes the same as taste with a fairly good amount of alcohol and slightly dry with bitterness on the end for balance. Seems to finish a bit on the bitter side. Overall a good drinking winter brew."

"Overall, it is a delicious beer to say the least. One that I look forward to every winter. This was my last bottle from last winters haul. IMO, its one of ommegang's best beers. If it's available in your area get it when it's in season. You won't regret it."

"Poured a deep red with a paper thin cream colored head. Nose is heavy with winter spices and sweet citrus. Taste was unusually sweet at first then a sharp tang if spice and hops at the finish with a lively carbonation throughout.  Very nice on a cold winter's (or cool summer's) day."

"Poured into a chalice. The beer pours a decent cream colored and creamy head that dissipates quickly. The beer itself is an opaque brown with a hints of red and light purple. The color is close to that of a lighter plum color. The beer smell has sweet dark fruits notes and bready yeast notes as well. The beer also has a very subtle alcohol note along with a slight caramel taste. However, the dark fruit notes such as plum, a little bit of grape, and nectarine dominate the smell. The taste is similar but the taste also has some Belgian sugar notes. The yeast notes are stronger and counteract the dark fruit tastes very well. The mouthfeel is heavy bodied with biting carbonation but is still very smooth. Overall, a good beer and one worth getting when you can. I can certainly see why this thing would warm someone up at night."

"Overall to me this is a very drinkable Belgium ale. Big ABV, light yeast thats not sure dry, and it has some fruity flavors mostly sour funk. Worth trying for 3 bucks."

"Price Point - $10.49/4pk/12 oz bottles"

""

"This is an excellent dark winter ale for those cold winter nights. The only catch is that you shouldn't drink as many as you want with a 10% ABV."
""
""
"O- This one was a strange experience. I thought the appearance and aroma was awesome but, for me, it dropped off from there. The huge carbonation and big burn just isn't my thing."
"O-a strong, complex brew that really opens up as it warms. Great beer."

"A unexpected favorite beer of the night. A beautiful rich mahogany color with a soft white head. The smell is all burnt sugars, spices and an enticing booziness that is not too strong. The taste follows the nose but as it warms it takes on the character of candy canes that have a more herbal than just peppermint flavor - which might sound a little odd but was really delightful. Some banana and spicy notes given off from the yeast I suppose. Large bouquet of earthy herbal notes in the flavor. Very easy to drink and hard to find the alcohol in there - it was nice and thick but with tighter bubbles that helped it not be cloying. Maybe my new favorite from ommegang - really great stuff."

"good job"

"Thank you Ommegang!!!"
"O: Good and very drinkable. If you like Unibroue, give this one a try."
"This is a great one I highly recommend."
""
"This is one of Ommegang's best beers. Better than their Three Philosphers and actually extremely close to the traditional Belgian quads. I imagine that this beer could stand out with the best of them."
"O: Adoration is a nice Winter time BSDA that I quite enjoyed. I think it will only benefit from age, but even in this young state it was full of flavor and character. As a fan of Belgian styles I must give hats off to Ommegang."
"Overall: A fantastic ageable brew from Ommegang. Love it, glad to pick it up yearly"
""
""
""
"Would buy again next year!"
""
""

"This beer is a beautiful reddish brown color. The head is of moderate size, dense with tightly packed bubbles. The scent is of sugary, spicy, woody aromas. It has a roasted, toast and malt quality. Not over the top, but very strong and Belgian. The taste is sweetish. It hides it's a ABV incredibly well. Full in body, with serious heft. Wonderful."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Very good but may well improve with age."
""
"O: The high carbonation and dryness really detract from this beer. A bit more mouthfeel and less carb and this would be a superb beer."
""
""
""
""
"Overall – A highly spiced Belgian Strong dark with a moderate boozy but very drinkable taste. This was one I rather enjoyed."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is a really nice, mellow but complex Belgian. Easy to drink and enjoy. The blend of flavors works well together and no one aroma or flavor overpowers another. Well done."
""
""
"With a little more ""depth"" and some carbonation, this could perhaps be rated .5 to .75 higher."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Atmosphere is pretty good. Bubbly head, spotty lacing at best. Nose is nutty with tea leaf and molasses. Roasted grains, raisin is prominent, molasses is present. Thick and syrupy. Overall this is a really good quaff."
""
""
"Absolutely Splendid."
""
""
""
"Overall, an ok Belgian ale but I feel it could use some time for everything to come together. The spices are just a little too strong and could use some time to fade. Nonetheless a good effort from Ommegang."
""
"Prost!"

"12 ounce bottle into signature tulip glass, bottled on 8/30/2013. Pours moderately cloudy reddish copper color with a 2-3 finger fairly dense and rocky light khaki head with fantastic retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of big plum, pear, raisin, apple, orange peel, caramel, toast, coriander, clove, pepper, candi sugar, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good complexity and balance of yeast, malt, and spice notes; with good strength. Taste of huge raisin, plum, pear, apple, orange peel, caramel, molasses, toast, coriander, clove, pepper, licorice, brown bread, candi sugar, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Lingering notes of raisin, plum, pear, apple, orange peel, caramel, molasses, toast, coriander, clove, licorice, brown bread, herbal, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a while. Fantastic complexity and balance of robust malt, fruity/spicy yeast, and spice flavors; with a great malt/spice balance and zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a moderately slick, crisp, and lightly syrupy mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with only a small warming present after the finish. Overall this is a highly excellent spiced Belgian strong ale! All around awesome complexity, balance, and robustness of malt, yeast, and spice flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the big ABV. A highly enjoyable offering."

"This is good stuff from Ommegang. It's very fitting for the winter and during the holidays. It has alot of Quadrupel characteristics and is in the ballpark. I would imagine this beer aging very well. Recommended."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall pretty nice, delivers what it promises with nice dark candi sugar, candied dark fruits, phenols and booze, sweet malts, etc. Pretty much a Belgian strong dark ale with touches of baking holiday spices."
""

""
""
""
""
"o: Surprisingly unusual but then this would be my first ""dark winter"" Belgian ale.. Easy drinking for a 10% ABV but not digging the flavor very much, especially the lingering bitter aftertaste. Still think their Abbey Ale and Three Philosophers rock."

"Pretty much perfect. Deep bright stewed apricot appearance... Smells of sweet and sour dark fruit.... Tasting is out of this world yet earthy....Again sweet and sour notes of stewed or candied fruits with all sorts of spices....liquid mincemeat... Bready yeasty toasty crusty ... Mouthfeel is silky not thick. The abv is masked well. Nothing sticky or cloying...worth the $15 for the four pack...o come let us adore this....this vessel of wise alchemy!"
""
""
"O: Ommegang really nailed the style here. This is a perfect Christmas-style Belgian Ale. It isn’t as big and bold as some get, but it strikes a nice balance. Very drinkable."
""
""
""
"Overall: A really solid version of a Dark Belgian Ale. Very good mix of spices and dark malt with the fruit flavors."
""
"Nice dark Belgian. Would like some more diversity in flavor but really good balance for what is there."

"holiday beer from ommegang, and while it is very festive given its broad spice profile, there is nothing about this beer that says to me it cant be enjoyed all year around. its a medium shade of brown on the pour, like iced tea, with a lot of fizzling carbonation and some yeast bits. the nose has a sort of indian/Asian spice profile with ginger and possibly cardamom, not out of balance, but prominent. darker malt profile and Belgian yeast give additional spice notes of white pepper, molasses, and even vanilla as it warms up. all of these smells are tastes too, with the yeast being the dominant feature. i am struck both by how well the alcohol is hidden, and how light this feels on the palate despite its looks. its extremely bubbly, which eases its rich malty sweetness, and it finishes more relaxed than it starts. a gentle beer for what it is, with much wider appeal in my opinion than just the holiday season. another gem from ommegang."
""
"D - An elite beer. One of the very best beers - if not the best - I've had this year. This is a big, big beer."

"Pours a very clouded brown. Thick head with thick lacing. Definitely bringing the Belgian here. Robust and earthy tones with a mild sweetness. The only detractor is a kind of tangy aged orange peel that is too prevalent for my tastes. Overall though, it’s nice. Definitely a winter ale. Would go very well with food."
""
""
""
"O- not too big but delicious"
""
"Overal - 4.75"
""
"Pours a murky brown with a foamy khaki head that settles to a partial film on top of the beer. Foamy streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, toffee, caramel, banana, and spice aromas. Taste is much the same with caramel, banana, and spice flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of spice bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp and prickly mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer with a great smell but the spices come through a bit more clearly in the flavor."
""
""
"Very good, tasty brew. Will definitely buy a lot more of this"
""
"Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Pours a hazy brownish orange amber with a massive three finger light tan head that slowly dissipates leaving massive sheets of lacing. Seasonal aroma of Belgian yeast, sweet bready malt and lots of spicing, primarily cinnamon and cardamom, some dark dried fruit. Flavor is rich dark fruit, orange, faint citrus, sweet bready malt, Belgian yeast, cardamom and clove, hints of alcohol. Medium bodied, slightly syrupy. A nice spiced Belgian strong dark ale, leaning towards the sweet end; the dense mixed fruit and spicing are quite appropriate for the Winter season, reminiscent of a mulled wine. Alcohol is barely noticeable, so covered well for this 10% ale."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, another quality beer from Ommegang. It's not all that different from other Ommegangs though... Not like that's a bad thing."
""
"Overall: I simply adore this ale! You don't expect so much from the mild aroma, then it hits you with a delicious smack-in-the-face flavor. What it lacks in aroma it more than makes up for in taste. This is exactly what I want from a beer of this style, and is actually one of my favorite beers to date, certainly as far as taste is concerned. Very well done Ommegang."

"Pours a hazy wooden amber with a huge off white head. Aroma is spicy from the yeast and cardaman, orange peel is defintiely there, candied sugar, spruce tips (even though I know they aren't actually there) and some alcohol. Flavor is sweet and spicy, with a bit too much sweetness going for this thing. Flavors follows the aroma pretty well though. A super fizzy, thinner mouthfeel. Overall, a touch to sweet for me, personally. Would prefer this one at half the abv, so it could cut back on some of the sugars this one drops on you.I didn't hate this, but also not a fan of this."

"The beer is very prickly over the palate. Really too much."

"O: I won't call it too sweet. I will call it too generically sweet, if that makes any sense. It isn't quite on par with, say, Keizer Blauw, but it is a super solid spiced BSDA. It's certainly worth drinking again, and doubly worth aging a year."
""
""
""
" nothing but what I expected from ommergang...after the acquisition by duval things seem to be actually be getting better... looking forward to the future"
""
""
""
"Overall just had one of these that was a couple years old and its a whole different animal fresh. Much of of a Belgian quality and less spice. Great beer either way and really fits into the winter scene well."
""
""
"o: real good stuff - just what i've come to expect from Ommegang. its advertised as a dark winter ale, and thats just what this is. light a fire and watch the snow fall as you drink this. the spices, fruits, and malts are all blended nice here. smooth winter drinker"
"O: A delicious brew once again from Ommegang. Great winter seasonal a real sipper."
""
""
"a deep amber in color with 2 fingers of off-white head, lots of great lacing left behind. lots of banana and raisins in the aroma, almost smells like banana nut bread.. figs, pecans, typical quad with a hint of sweet pie spices. the flavor is pretty much exactly the same as the aroma. sweet raisiny, fruity, with a bit of an alcohol bite. a full body beer with modest carbonation. this is surprisingly good.. picked up a 12oz bottle, and i recommend doing the same. doesn't taste like much of a holiday beer, just a really good quad."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - This beer reminded me a bit of the Keizer Blauw mixed with St Bernardus 12. A definite sipper. Lots of sweetness and lots of spice. A great seasonal beer and something that seems like it would age well."
"Does make me wonder what this beer would be like with cellaring as recommended on the bottle. Might it mellow out and not be as warming? Would the spices come out more or muddle together to make more of a mulled beer flavor? I think I need to find out."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a hazy brown to amber shade with modest head. Nose is surprisingly light for a winter beer like this with so many exotic ingredients which one might normally think would lead to a very aromatic beer. The glory of this beer is solely on the palate as far as I'm concerned because it has a savory sweetness that is a little malty and a lot of caramel, but then rounded out by a nice mixture of holiday spices. There's plenty of complexity. Easy drinking, very easy drinking, and it goes down like a 6% beer would... not some 10% monster. I'm skeptical that the ABV is accurate because it is so incredibly imperceptible."
""
""
"Wish I had another bottle with some age, first time having this beer and want to try a fresh."
""
""
""
"Overall maybe a little too hot and sweet, but an overall enjoyable beer"
"The taste has most of the same spicy and roasted elements as the nose but I am also picking up a little something like vanilla beans. Definite bitterness at the finish. This has some punch but would be enjoyable on a snowy, winter day."
""
""
""
"O - Awesome season - don't know what else to say."
""

"10% feels great here. Classic Ommegang execution. On-point to style with lush Belgian dark ale maltiness and Christmas-y spice. Excellent."

"2011 Vintage! Served from tap into a Trappe Door tulip. Poured massively dark red brown with a two finger light tan head that subsided to a half finger slowly. Maintained nice lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, dark fruit, bread, sweet alcohol, raisin, and subtle toasted bread. The flavor was of sweet malt, bread, wood, dark fruit, and sweet alcohol. It had a medium feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a good brew. The notes of dark fruit going on in this one really tied everything together and made it quite enjoyable throughout each sip. There was a nice touch of sweet alcohol as well which reminded you what you were drinking. This was fairly nice for the style. Really glad I got the chance to tick it on tap and I suggest you at least do the same once."

"O-a nice Belgian ale, enjoyable to sip, solid flavor"

"D: this thing is pretty smooth and tasty. big but not hot. seems like cellar time has helped mellow the abv. a nice Belgian dark imo."

"Overall I would say this is one of the top 5 beers I have ever had. This stuff is a MUST try. There is a lot going on here... The spices and orange flavor are perfectly balanced. This is no Blue Moon. This is truly Heaven in a glass. I love there Three Philosophers. Like all of these beers in this catagory, let it warm up a bit as the true flavors come out. AWESOME."
"Beer notes from 12/7/09; had it on tap at Tyler's Taproom in NC: pours copper amber brown with a small tan head; smells sweet with spices, malt, orange peel, coriander, cinnamon and more spices. Tastes spicy up front with yeast, malt, orange peel, coriander, cinnamon and spices like a heavy Belgian that seemed unbalanced. Almost tastes skunky from all the winter spices (pepper, nutmeg, cinnamon, etc.), with mild carbonation that had an overall heavy feel to it. This brew was OK, but I would hesitate to get this again."

"They did not mess around when it comes to the amount of spices in this beer. Loads of fruit as well as a dense maltyness. Almost too much going on at once. This is to be sipped for sure."
""
""
""
""
"Really enjoyed this beer - I would reach for it again in a heartbeat if looking for a ""Winter Ale"" style that is true to form and relatively sessionable for a 10%-er. Ommegang does not disappoint with this one."

"Notes: OMG! one of the best smelling and best tasting beers I have ever tasted. I love this beer"
"O- my first ommegang and i must say its barely tolerable. It's like someone took a bunch of grapes and apples, put them in a jar until they rotted, and poured it into my tulip. Intensely sweet & sour grapes/apples dominate everything, with holiday spices and bubblegum yeast playing the supporting role. I sit here with half a bomber left and continue to tell myself ""it'll get better, let it warm a bit."" I'll try my hardest not to drain pour this, but i can't guarantee anything..."
""
""
"This was unique and quite enjoyable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a world-class BSDA, among the best I've had from anywhere."
"I get lots of Ommegang in Alberta but not this one, thanks again Liam for shipping the bottle. I'd recommend throwing this one under the stairs for a while but I had no way to know that with the single bottle"
""
"Overall, I deserve what I get from Ommegang. They just continue to displease me over and over again. Even with age the the bold spiciness serves only to accentuate the hot, fusel alcohol character of the beer. I've am officially done with Ommegang until further notice, especially because of the excessive price point of most of their beers. For good American examples of Belgian styles seek anything from Allagash."

"Unusual twist on one of my favorite styles. Although a good beer, I do think turning down the spice level a bit would have helped, the spices tend to overwhelm what I like best about this style. Would be a nice beer on a cold winter night, but treat it with respect, it is a potent one."

"This is a nice slow sipper. Light enough for year round but still very rich. Another winner from Ommegang."
""
"Presentation: Packaged in a twenty-two ounce brown glass Belgian bomber sealed with a cork and cage, served in a Great Divide chalice"
"Overall: You're kidding me if you don't try it, if you have the chance grab it. Little sweet in a awkward type of way but hard on raw yeast flavor. Keeping drinking, salud!"

"1.5 finger head with good retention and nice lacing on a cloudy deep amber brown body. Aroma is very sweet and smells like candy and pineapple. Flavor Is mostly dark fruit including plum and raisin mostly. Belgian yeast and cinnamon round this one out. Medium body and moderate to high carbonation. Overall very complex flavorful and drinkable. An excellent beer and must try."
"O-A tasty brew, the higher alcohol content does get to you after a while though. Will gladly have again."
""
"Brown with ruby red showing up near the bottom, one finger of tan coloured head, little to no lace. Smell is overwhelmingly spicy at first, corriander and mace, dark fruit shows up under a layer of alcohol, earthy, orange peel, mollasses and some yeast round out the nose. Taste is also quite spicy, cardamom, citrusy orange flavours, cinnamon and pepper, fruit rolls in with yeast, chocolatey with some hot alcohol in the finish with more spice and dark fruits. Medium high carbonation, full body and weight. Pretty good and better as it warmed up but at points seemed to be over spiced and boozy, decent drinkability that may have improved with a few more months in the cellar."
"O- A delicious and really well made beer. The more of this I drink, the better it gets. For the alcohol content, this is dangerously drinkable."
""
"They certainly are true in their advertising, this is a beer you want to sit down by a roaring fire with and maybe some great winter dishes. I could taste the cardamom but the other advertised tastes were more muted, yes you can detect the spice, orange peel, coriander...but mostly malt and caramel. It's an above average, pretty well balanced winter ale which is saying something for 10%. I would recommend trying in a group of 2-4 with lamb or a suitably strong complementary flavor. Tasted on 3-6-2012."

"Adoration is the first Strong Winter Ale released by Brewery Ommegang, and this brew pours a dark cherry, features a thin beige head that provides very tick lacing. Some malty notes are overwhelmed by dark fruit, clove, cinnamon, and Belgian yeast. Dark fruits are very heavy on the pallet, cherry, fig, and raisin hints blend very well with some spice and brown sugar. The alcohol, 10%, is very well masked in this medium bodied, medium-high carbonated winter warmer. Love this brewery!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The alcohol heat and strong spicing definitely encourage you to sip this beer at a warm temperature. Perhaps what the brewery was envisioning as a strong winter ale. I enjoyed but there was a bit too much alcohol in the finish for my taste."
""
""
""
"Pours a rusty brown color, hazed and topped with a creamy beige foam. Aroma of estery Belgian yeast, clove, cinnamon, and candied fruits. In the taste, sweet malts, raw dusty cinnamon flavor, orange peel, coriander and peppery spice bite. Muted fruit notes and little bitterness. There is a small heat from the alcohol, but 10% ABV it tastes not. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with an appetizingly dry finish. Overall, a fine winter warmer from Ommegang, but the presence of the Belgian yeast and traditional spices break it from the category. Guidelines aside, this is a tasty ale."

"This is a great winter beer. It is nice to just luxuriate in the richness of this beer and the spice that fits for the season."
"Adoration is certainly a sipper or for pairing with finger foods. This is a perfect match for a cold snowy day and a book."
""
"I like a lot of the beers from Ommegang, but not this one. It's simply too strong for my liking. I don't mind 10% ABV, I'd just like it hidden a bit better. More hops and/or more sweetness would be appreciated."
"O: Surprising that others had never tried this, but we all agreed this was one that would be good during the cold. Great surprise..."
"Overall, one of the best beers I have ever tasted."
"O - One of my favorite winter beers so far. Got a bunch of these hanging out, looking forward to seeing how they age. Im guessing this one was about 6 mo. old already, no bottle date, but I got it before Ommegang released it this year, way back in late summer. Can't wait to enjoy the rest."
"Taste-Dark orchard fruits, plums, caramel, coriander, cinnamon, orange peel. full of character and very complex. A definite sipper to share. Recommended."
"Notes: Pleasing Ommegang offering, typically I find some of their brews a bit bland, and this one is pleasingly solid. Not really in the top tier of stuff they do but well worth the try."
""
""
"Overall- This really reminded me of a wintery Three Philosophers. It's delicious, and clean compared to similar Belgian strongs I've tried. Knows what it wants to be and does it with style and flair. I have to say that I sometimes think that Ommegang gets overhyped, but this particular offering deserves all the praise it gets. Luscious."
""
"Medium consistency in the mouthfeel and a small notice of the alcohol with a dry finish. An excellent brew that is very enjoyable."

""
"B+"
""
"Overall, this is excellent fare, the beer being nicely balanced between sugars, bitterness, and spices, and each ingredient blends well with the others, producing a lovely overall effect. The beer manages to be delicious and warming without resorting to heavy spices, but is simultaneously refreshing and appealing, despite the hardly-noticeable 10% ABV. Recommended."

"O. This beer is exactly what I expected from Ommegang as a dark spiced winter ale. Belgian yeast is the most noticeable characteristic on the nose and the taste followed by all kinds of subtle deliciousness. I would buy it again to sit on it for a few years to see what happens to it."
"O - I really enjoyed this. Not as heavy as some BSDAs can be, but still substantial. Definitely a cold weather brew. Some unexpected bright notes in the taste that complemented the spices nicely."
""
""
""
""
"NICE, WORTH TRYING!"
""
"D: This was a nice beer with decent scent and taste, and excellent body. The alcohol was well hidden, so it was easy to drink. The flavor was very clean, but not my favorite profile, so it was somewhat enjoyable but definitely not top tier for the style. May age well, but fine to drink fresh."
""
"O: I aged this for a year before drinking. A wonderful and drinkable beer, Adoration has lots of spice and sour fruit with a hint of chocolate. It is not as heavy as other noels, and the sour flavors add a cider or wine feel to the finish."
""
""
""
"O - Funky fruity, sweet spices, alcoholic but still super refreshing which is great"
"Great balance of ""normal"" beer and the added ingredients. Easy to drink and enjoyable on a winter night."
""
""
""
""
"Pours cloudy, amber-brown with thick, foamy, cream-colored head. Aroma is of cherries, plums, bready malt and aromatic spices. Can definitely note the coriander and orange peel, complemented by estery yeast notes. Malty, sweet flavor with dark cherry and other fruit notes. Lots of yeast and spices coming through, with ample ethanol heat on the back end. Definitely hitting at a good balance but it's a little rough around the edges. Medium body, good mouthfeel except the alcohol comes in a bit strong, especially as the beer warms. Admittedly though, alcohol heat is a good thing for this beer's context - ""Sip it on a winter eve, sitting before a fire."" The aroma is on the spot, but it seems the flavors could meld a bit more for it to be a truly great beer."
""
""
"Very tasty beer, with great fruity and yeastiness to it. I'm not sure why it's a winter seasonal though, these beers are great year round!"
""
""

"Ommegang Adoration is a dim, cloudy brown ale with a light beige head that's smooth and elastic with pretty good retention. It has kind of a sweet aroma, with notes of raisins, prunes, cherries, figs and lots of spices. It's pretty full bodied and quite smooth. The finish is tidy. It tastes pretty sweet, fruity and spicy. It's kind of like a spice cake, with lots of dried fruit, especially prune. As it warms up, the cardamom really comes out. It reminds me of Trois Pistoles, but spiced. I like it a lot."
"The aroma was very nice, a little bit ruddy at first. Hints of chcoalte and caramel, rich belgian spice and a wonderful bit of dark fruit all dancing around wonderfully inside of it. But it was once I took a sip that everything really came together for me. A wave of cascading brown sugar and tart apples just rolled across the tongue. Enormously rich and vigorous, this was just a wonderful thing to behold. Nice touches of chocolate and rich toffee like notes were all balanced well in advance of a lovely dark fruit tone that led the charge once the yeast kicked in. Nice notes of prunes and rasins, hints of plums and dark cherries were all very much evident in the profile."
"O: A nice Belgian Strong Dark Ale, and strong is very appropriate since this beer is very boozy. Once the initial alcohol shock passes, the beer mellows to have some nice flavors."
""
"O – Really solid brew here. Sipper for sure but damn fine on a cold winter night. Nice well balanced and tasty."
""
""
"O: If the spicing were reigned in a bit, this would be an absolutely incredible holiday treat. As is, it is a very good strong ale that could use a bit more tweaking. If you're a fan of Brewery Ommegang's other products, you'll probably like this one."
"Solid offering from Ommegang."
"O- Besides the lifeless nose, I did enjoy this beer a lot and would like to revisit this in bottle form perhaps? Either way it's a good beer as they usually are from Ommegang."
"Poured from a 22 oz bottle into a goblet, 2011 edition. This pours a yeast hazy dark tea color with a small off white head which quickly dissipates. The smells are very sweet, I get lots of orange, some coriander, caramel and caramel. The feel is medium with high carbonation. The taste is similar to the smell, lots of the fruit with coriander along with various malts, there is a little funk along with some alcohol burn at the end, this might be a little too sweet for me to love."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this beer wasn't bad but the dark fruits overpower everything as it warms, even the zesty spice which provided a nice balance up front. It's also a bit hotter than expected with a poorly masked abv. I'm glad I didn't buy a 750."

"D: The spice character makes this one great for drinking in the winter. The alcohol is concealed very well, and I could see myself easily polishing off a bottle of this over the course of a night."

"I think it is worth trying because you never know."
"O- My brother loves it more than I do. Maybe I've had one too many Christmas ales bc this one doesn't seem to differentiate itself to me."

"Adoration is a complex product of masterful brewers of the highest caliber. Artists with sophisticated technique and abilitiies. The perfect complement requires the requsite skills , complexity, and depth of the highest order so I recommend Cecil Taylor's Salty Swift and Not Goodbye cd as the perfect complement to such an outragous and delightful ale."

"O: Man, oh man... This beer was right in my wheelhouse, as I love me a Belgian beer and this one ticks everything I love most about them. Light funk, dried fruit, hidden ABV's..."
"So glad I got to enjoy this fine ware, yet another gem from Ommegang. It surely drinks as much as a ramped-up Winter Warmer as a BSDA. Very nicely done, as usual, from one of my very favorite breweries."
"I can't say I've had many beers like it so I give it some bonus points for the overall score. I could see this being a holiday standard for me as it is fit for a post turkey drink or an evening by the fireplace."
"Outstanding, decidedly Belgian interpretation of a winter style. Different, yet approachable."
"On tap at burger. in Santa Cruz. Pours a clear deep copper color with a compact tan head. Big burnt caramel aroma with raisins and fruity booze. Plenty of assorted spices. Flavor is malty and boozy, very Christmasy, coriander and raisins and fruitcake. Dry alcoholic finish with associated astringency. Pretty decent desserty beer."
"Happily able to grab some of this from DeCicco's in Brewster, New York although I got stuck with the last pint or two into a partial growler fill (free though!). This stuff has a radiant rusty, near cherry colored copper appearance with a pretty flimsy topping that offers some modest signs of lacing. The aroma is a beautifully pungent cherry brandy with apple nutmeg sweetness, deep and near candy-like and even a touch of Dr. Pepper and fruit nougat. Really captivating. The taste buds receive bright liquid oak and brandy with ideas of nutmeg-clove, vanilla malt and light cherry-rhubarb. Alcohol is notable but not overpowering. It has peppery edges with very delicate but effective carbonation. The feel is also near brandy-like, medium-heavy bodied, fairly thick but just a bit more watery so as to invite more than just sipping despite the hefty ABV. Alcohol releases at the finish and more of the oak barrel kind of qualities seem evident. Though drinkable enough, this seems like it's enjoyed best as a single serving. Something to savor on a winters night while contemplating the fireplace and snowy landscapes outside your window. Very nice."
"O: real good beer - nothing overwhelming, but a certain treat for a cold autumn or winter night - has earthy, woodsy qualities, sweet but complex"
"Overall - a seriously awesome beer. Fairly complex ingredient lists I've come to expect from Ommegang's BIG beers didn't disappoint. The only issues I found with the beer were a slightly bitter aftertaste on the back of the tongue and a little less carbonation than I would expect from this style of beer. Glad I bought more than one though..."
"O: Not a go to beverage, but an exceptional gift on a special occasion. I would grab a couple bombers to take to a family thanksgiving dinner, perfect beer you could sip 12oz over an hour or two. Does not blow me away, but keeps up to par with my expectations from Ommegang. I have not had an average beer from them yet."
"Overall Impression- While it seems this beer had aged for a bit of time, this only helped it become something bigger and better! Very rich and complexed, it was a sipping beer for sure. One of those brews that you enjoy every drink and then can't wait for the next. Recommend highly!"
"O: Just another beer to remind me to not buy beers in this style anymore. It was good, and I can see why other people would like them, but I just don't."
"O: Good. Drinkable. Not my favorite Ommegang, but still recommended."
"O: Another good beer from Ommegang, though admittedly not one of my favourites. I wouldn't have another, on account of the sweet cherries, but it is generally recommended. Excellently sippable."
"This beer poured out as a hazy looking brown color. The head was big and tan. The head leaves a decent lacing along the glass. The smell of the beer has an interesting citrusy aroma along with some dark fruit and yeast on the nose. The taste has a good amount of dark malts and fruity flavors coursing through the beer, the flavors of spice and citrus give off a bit of a refreshing warmth to the beer. The mouthfeel is very smooth, not overly carbonated. Overall the beer has a good flavor and is one of Ommegangs best in my opinion."
"This beer pours a murky brown to amber with a yellow head that was quite active. Left good lacing. The smell and taste is exactly what you'd expect from a Belgian Strong. Lots of that 'yeasty' flavour with a great dark fruit (currants, dates) backbone. Some sweet malts mixed in with the breadiness of the yeast. I did pick up some banana and cloves and perhaps a touch of coriander. Mouthfeel was average, slightly drying. Overall I enjoyed this beer, a great winter seasonal."
"Mouthfeel is relatively carbonated and bubbly but the bubbles are rather fine and seem to go well with the brew. Overall I very much enjoyed this brew and really need to find it somewhere to take home."
"D - Pretty drinkable. Lots of strong and complex flavors here really hit pretty hard. Much more of a sipping beer, but I am enjoying it more and more every sip."
"Drinkability: I wish this wasn’t my last bottle. That’s pretty much all I have to say. On a cold rainy night, this beer hits the spot, and reminds me (and my wife) what Christmas tastes like, and it tastes good."
"Cheers"
"O-i started out not liking this stuff but as i kept drinking it i found myself appreciating the subtleties and the evolution of the flavors as the beer warmed."
"O- This beer was a little underwhelming to me. I expected a little more but it didn't come through. I thought the alcohol was good on this never becoming too overwhelming. The carbonation while lively didn't do much to offset the heavy feeling to this."
"O: The spiciness can become a bit tiring after a handful of sips. Good, but I couldn't see myself drinking much of this."
"Overall, a good beer that's hard to gauge without know how old it is. Not worth the price, though."
"D: Solid winter warmer which I would try again. Nothing amazing but has all the aspects in looking for in this style"
"O- This is a good beer that could be great if the spices were dialed back a little bit. It's a little over the top, and you'll want a friend to help you finish a 750ml. It's a good beer though, and definitely worth a try if you like Winter beers."
"Overall this was a good Belgian ale, just a little too much spice for my taste."
"Pours a cloudy, dark ruddy amber color. 1/3 inch head of an off-white color. Great lacing and good retention. Smells of yeast, alcohol, sweet malt, slight hop, slight spice, and a hint of citrus. Fits the style of a Belgian Strong Dark Ale. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of sweet malt, alcohol, slight yeast, hint of hop, and good spice note (all spice and cinnamon, mostly). Overall, good appearance, aroma, and body."
"Not an earth-shattering beer by any means, but real nice overall."
"Had a snifter at the Gingerman in Manhattan. It appeared hazy brown with a short tan head. This reminded me of a St. Bernardus 8 in that there's a caramel syrup character along with the mild ester and spice. For the most part this is a fine sipping beer. It's not the most complex dark Belgian, but smooth and delicious nevertheless."
"D: Pretty good, tasty, I'd like more."
"D - seeing as how I like Belgians normally, but not spiced beers, this was interesting -- not one I'd return to, but I'm glad I tried it; not bad, but not for me"
"Pretty drinkable, enjoying this by a fire, per the recommendation on the bottle. Beers like this make the Winter much more enjoyable"
"Overall: A complex, enjoyable, and well done Belgian Strong Dark Ale."
"I really like the way it feels in the mouth, but you heat up quick from the 10% ABV. A good fire-side sipper."
"Bottom line is, this is an outstanding, top-shelf beer and a MUST DRINK for lovers of Belgian styles. One of the best beers I've had the last few months."
"Poured a dark copper almost brownish color with a small head and some lacing. The smell is where the bottle is much different from the tap. A ton of delicious apple along with spice and nutmeg. The apple smell is what differentiates the bottle from the tap. The apple smell is so different and distinct in the bottle tasting. I can't remember a belgian ale I have had that has so much fruit fragrance in it. It is just terrific. The taste is of more nutmeg, spice and cinnamon. A little bit of light fruit in the taste as well. This beer is very smooth and creamy, but there is no doubt it is a 10% beer. While it may be an easy beer to chug, you should take your time and just sip and enjoy this beer. A great unique version of a belgian dark ale."
"Pours a hazy deep amber color with a small light tan head. In the aroma, coriander and a bit boozy. In the taste, dry spice, cinnamon and mace stand out, a small orange citrus and a bit hot from the alcohol. A spice bite and medium to light bodied mouthfeel, with a dry cinnamon spice in the aftertaste. Nice spice with a lighter body, a bit boozy but nice."
"i've had this on tap a few times last year too and adored it (see what i did there?). very glad i aged this bottle. i'll have to grab this year's too, but its kind of hard for me to cough up the $20 bucks for it again. you gotta try this once though, it's fantastic."
"I had high hopes for Adoration Ale. At the end of the day, it's pretty and is more than worth a try. But, it doesn't quite live up to a lot of other holiday releases out there (especially the Belgian styles). Its biggest problem is that it's one dimensional. For a Belgian style, that's not a good thing. The holiday spice presence tends to dominate some of the other aspects, rather than complement them. More Belgian yeast and less spices sounds like the right ticket. Nonetheless, it's pretty good. Definitely worth picking up at least once."
"Enjoyed a beautiful tulip at Black Sparrow Pub. Ommegang adoration has a sour back and head like cappuccino. Short bread malt is predominant with grains of paradise spicing everything up. Rich and complex in satisfying way. Amber red-brown; very heavily bodied."
"Adoration is not a hard beer to love, provided you're down with highly savory spices and a bone-warming alcohol content. I'm almost inclined to say that people living in hot climates won't ""get"" this beer. For me, having it in the midst of a chilly Canadian winter looking out at the snow and frost, I can think of nothing more gratifying than the prospect of staying in with a full bottle of this potent, poignant ale. I'll definitely be courting this one again."
"Taste of dark over ripe fruit with an array of spice flavours, banana, bubble gum, sweet and sour tartness, moderately warming. The ten per cent alcohol is masterfully handled with a smooth swallow and great after taste. Medium body and perfectly balanced, this Belgian Dark Ale is appropriately named. In fact, I came close to giving it a 5 for drinkability!"
"Review #100. This Belgian Strong Ale pours a medium orange golden brown from a 750ml corked and caged bottle into a heavy chalice glass. Medium sized tan foamy head, with good retention and nice lacing. The aroma is caramel malts, oranges, bananas, bread, cardamom, yeasty and sweet. A medium to full bodied Belgian Strong Ale. The malts are fruity and sweet, banana and clove, orange and coriander. There is a bunch of sugar like sweetness as well. The hops are earthy and spicy. The spicing is interesting, coriander, mace, cardamom, and orange peel are all noticeable and mix and match nicely with the sweet malts, if they weren't there this beer would be way too sweet. Nice lively carbonation. Nice winter ale. Meant to be sipped slowly, perhaps in front of a roaring fire (be sure you have a fireplace!). Hides the alcohol very well. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is sweet with some spices."
"D - Like a lot of winter beers for me they are tough to drink a lot of...poured mine out of a bomber and it was just enough...maybe even a little too much."
"D - Pretty good but too spicy. Difficult to have a bottle bottle to myself. Alcohol is masked wonderfully but that spice is holding it back."
"Anyhow, it's a lovely, spicy, fruity dubbel. Just a little bitter to match the sweet and the spice. Super delicious yum time. Mmmm. A real treat. Might have to get some bottles of this stuff, and hang on to it for awhile."
"Quite drinkable, but with a fairly hefty punch (10%), so more than a couple wouldn't be prudent. It does go down quite easy though..."
"Mouthfeel and drinkability are great. Medium carbonation but a thick almost creamy body. However, it's not very filling. Considering the abv, you might want to have only a couple, but the taste and relative less filling body say have a few more. Very well done as most hinge by ommegang are."
"Dinkability suffers a touch for me because the flavors are so big, I would be satisfied with a few glasses once a year. This is, however, a fantastic Christmas beer, or one to enjoy after a day-long skiing session."
"Overall impression: wow! bursts of flavor. the best damn dark strong ale ever!"
"D. Went down really easy, this is a nice beer that goes well with time of year."
"750ml corked bottle pours a slightly clear dark brown colour on the first glass, and a very dark and not clear pour on the second. Tastes of dark fruits with a lot of spice lingering in the finish. Drinks down quite well for a 10% beer. Honestly didn't pick up much hotness in this one at all. Tasty belgian style beer overall."
"D - Easy to drink. The alcohol is not noticeable at all."
"750 ml corked and caged bottle. Served in a chalice, the beer pours a ruby red/brown color with about an inch off-white head. Head retention and lacing are both good. Aroma is sweet, the brew smells like dark fruit, coriander, orange peel, and some bready malt. Unfortunately, the taste isn't sweet like the aroma. There's a bitter and slightly metallic flavor that I notice more than anything else, although it's not too overpowering. Orange peel, dark fruit, and spice flavors are also noticable. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit creamy and is well carbonated. Drinkability isn't good, but would be better if Iiked the taste of this beer. It was hard enough for me to finish the bottle. For whatever reason I just didn't care for the taste of this brew."
"D- This is one flavor packed brew. The spices are a bit out of control so be sure you know what you are getting into."
"Overall, a nice beer. It's a little on the sweet side, but I liked it and thought the spices worked well. First sips cold are some of the best."
"D: A little tasty, goes down dangerously easy, not too filling, well-disguised strong kick, good representation of style, this is a solid stronger Belgian beer worth drinking for a while."
"D: No problems with drinkability. At 10%, I felt a slow ""warming"" sensation come over me, but would have been game to split a second bomber back-to-back if we'd had one available. I really enjoyed this brew."
"Very drinkable for the ABV. I enjoyed much more this time than at my first tasting at an Ommegang event. Another fine product from them."
"D- That nose is great! A nice beer and the high ABV makes it a sipping beer"
"Raising come through first in the taste, with a little bit of the nutmeg chew malt, and some sourness. There is some clove on the finish but there is a very tight big dense carbonation throughout the palate. Luckily there is not big ABV sting from the ten percent and some lip smacking honey leaving at least some good drinkability all things considered."
"D: The beer is quite drinkable because the alcohol is for the most part well hidden although the amount of spices in the flavors makes this beer one that is better sipped."
"D- This is another brew well done by Ommegang-they do a pretty good job at winterizing this brew. Its warm and spicy-the alcohol heat is there with no astringency-which is a nice touch. Not as complex as other Ommegangs but still very good overall."
"A good beer in which to seek refuge from a blizzad-y day."
"Drinkability: I bought this as a spur of the moment purchase in celebration of the first snow (re: blizzard) of the season. This beer does not dissapoint- it is tasty and goes very well with cold, wintry weather."
"An amazing beer. Filled with spicy aromas that are immediately present in the pour. A very full appearance- thick head that mellows out. Upon your first sip- an abundance of clove like- flavor that tell you this is made for Winter! It settles nicely on the tongue, sweet and strong. What is amazing about this beer is how it warms so nicely. The flavors mellows out- scary that is brew is so strong. I have never had a better beer of this style."
"A little much for me - the heavy, rich stone fruits & alcohol add up to a pretty full offering. Not my cup of tea, exactly, but one is enjoyable enough. Can't say I'd run back to this one, though."
"On tap at American Craft. Poured into an Ommegang glass (of course, this being the sister of the Publick House). Dense brown color with red backglow. Thick, creamy, persistent head. Cinnamon and nutmeg nose. Almost too sweet on the tongue... Almost. It's a bit too sweet for my limit but still enjoyable. I feel like 2 or 3 of them might give me that feeling I got on Christmas as a kid after eating too much candy. Still worth a try if, like me, you love the Belgian Strong Darks thistime of year."
"At the Mohawk House in Sparta, NJ. Into a tulip, it poured a cloudy chestnut with one finger of beige head; great retention and lacing, and little visible carbonation. The nose revealed nutmeg, allspice, sour cherry, vanilla, and candied pears...a great mix. The taste revealed all of the above, in a nicely balanced blend, as well as some plum too, and the finish was both sour and spicy. Quite dynamic, with a very subtle hint of alcohol strength. The feel was of medium thickness, with a lingering hidden carbonation factor, which added a nice spritz. I was very impressed with the complexity and balance in this beer. Great winter sipping beer."
"The beer pours a deep red color with a cream-colored head. The aroma is heavy on the toffee and caramel malt, along with some Belgian yeast, brown sugar and cinnamon. The flavor is heavier on the spicing than the aroma. I get cinnamon and cloves, as well as some brown sugar, caramel malt, yeast, dark cherries and a little bit of alcohol. Still, the alcohol is fairly well hidden for a 10 percent ABV beer. Medium mouthfeel and high carbonation."
"I also recommend pouring it into a tulip glass, as the taste and flavour seemed to come out better in a tulip glass compared to others."
"D: Not bad, but at 1.5xs the regular Ommegang price, it doesn't stand up to the other brews in the $10 range."
"Very drinkable; you don't even notice the 10% ABV."
"Time to see how this thing stacks up after a year of absence. It pours a hazy ruby-amber topped by a finger of cream foam. The nose comprises cinnamon, nutmeg, chamomile, banana, clove, pepper, and some light chocolate. The taste does not want to deviate much from this at all, though the spices come through decidedly more...spicy...more pronounced and in-your-face. The body is a straight medium, with a light carbonation and a grainy feel. Overall, a nice Winter brew, but the spices were just a bit too much for my liking."
"This beer is supposed to ""taste like Christmas"" according to my buddy. So we shall see just how this all works out. This beer pours a golden brown color to which I must admit does appear appetizing. The smell is strongly of mulled spices that I would truly associate with the holiday of Christmas. The taste I found however to be great on my first sip, but then wildly overwhelming as the spices built upon my tongue. Even when sipping this beer the spices can sneak up on you. I personally had trouble drinking this, and the consensus of the group was that this would be better if after every sip you could clear your palate. Perhaps a nice cheese and cracker plate with this at a party would do wonders for it. As it stands as I review it, it's just a bit too much for me, but I must admit the other aspects I did fully enjoy."
"Chocolate covered cherries with happy Belgian yeasty goodness. Deep layers of flavor. This is classified as a winter warmer according to Ommegang. While I wouldn't necessarily think of it as such next to other beers that also call themselves winter warmers, it would be a good choice on a cold evening. There are some winter warmer type spices but they don't hit you over the head. It's a sit and sip sort of thing. Big, sweet flavors in a smooth drinking experience. Tasty times."
"It really is a winter warmer; Cuddling up with this beer is the ultimate relaxation on a cold winter's night."
"D - This beer is very drinkable in taste, however the high alcohol content would limit consumption for most people."
"Notes: not quite as rich, intense and sweet as a Belgian Strong Dark. great blend of a BSD and a witbier. delicious through and through"
"Belgian Strong Dark Ale plus the usual spices you would expect to put a holiday spin on the style. Some coriander and orange peel, sweetness that hints of honey. Lively carbonation. The alcohol is a little warm and bites ever so slightly at the finish."
"Poured from the tap a copper color with a small rose hue with a small amount of sediment left floating and a nice firm white head that slowly faded and left the trademark belgina lacing on the glass. Smell is very complex with this belgian, i get dark fruits up front with a small amount of citrus and clove in the back. Taste is better than the smell. Intense amount of fruit and spice, clove and corriander with cherry and orange all balanced or backed by a good amount of malt. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy very nicely balanced. For a 10% beer this one goes down quite smooth and the taste is so complex it leaves you wanting another glass."
"One of my favorite styles. Looking forward to this one with great anticipation. Corked and caged..pours a cloudy amber with deep rose hue and a half an inch of light foamy head that fades fairly quickly. The surface collar is continuously refreshed by the tiny bubbles of effervescence from beneath. TONS of sediment visible on the bottom of the bottle. Stringy patterns of Belgian lacing left behind. The smell is sweet malty earthy harvest fruit CHERRY orange peel coriander...OMG!! The flavor totally matches up to the nose!! AMAZING!! The mouth feel is perfect..CREAMY SMOOTH body embellished by the texture of many many tiny bubbles. HUGELY drinkable!!..I just changed my mind from 4.5 to 5.0. 10% ABV has never been easier to do. GREAT JOB on this one from Cooperstown. Cheers!!!"
"Complex taste, but all comes together in a very drinkable blend. Another win from Ommegang."
"Comes out of the tap a dark opaque reddish coppery-amber with a fine-bubbled light tan head. Aroma is malty and a little fruity, the latter mainly apple. Flavor is fruity and malty, and just a little bit honey-sweet. Texture is smooth and slightly tingly."
"Pours a two finger, cream head that fades very slowly leaving a good lace. Hazy amber color. Good carbonation and medium bodied. Nose is light holiday spice. Flavor is spicy malts, hints of orange peel. Nice winter ale. Pricey at $15.00 for a caged and corked 750ml bottle from Tully's Beer & Wine Wells, ME."
"Dark plumb color with some brown highlights. Thick 1/2"" head at pour settle to nice web on face of beer with thick cream colored ring on edge of glass. Aroma is quite pleasant. Sounds wierd but has a bright aroma of dark fruits, well balanced with spicey notes. Some alcohol present in the nose. Moderate carbonation. Big mediciny alcohol aftertaste. Pretty nice lacing on glass. Pretty good mouthfeel, slightly silky. Dark fruits in flavor, pick up some slight roastiness in long aftertaste. Sits relatively light, and pretty drinkable. Other than after taste body smooths alcohol well ."
"A drinkable winter warmer, the alcohol, for 10%, does not seem so apparent given the intense flavors that tend to mask it, but it does catch up with you. This is an orangey fruitcake in a glass and I am liking it as a holiday ale. I wish I had a fire going in the fireplace to go with it."
"Poured a chestnut-reddish brown (yes, had to use that adjective (read the label and think about it)) with minimal but soapy head that left lace down the glass. Just a real spicy, fruity aroma; the coriander, clove, peeper are all able to be pointed out as well as a yeast twang, orange peel and citric notes and some dry, bready malt. Unbelievably spicy yet sweet are the first words that come to mind to describe taste. That and for a 10% beer the alcohol doesn't overpower anything at all and isn't even that strong on the backbite. It's like eating a cinnamon sugar cookie; there's a real sugary sweetness that could be desrcibed as cinnamon/nutmeg/ginger and sharp/spicy as clove and coriander perk up. A thicker medium body that could be described as slightly creamy, this beer also has a dry edge to it thanks to some roasted-like malts and a very noticeable citric (orange/banana) fruit flavor. ABV more noticable as it warms and it is definitely a sipper but one that anyone should try."
"Taste is very spicy and crisp, it's sweet and fresh, with a nice maltiness. Mouthfeel I smooth and crisp. Very tasty and drinkable."
"D: A decent beer and probably best in small servings."
"D/M: slight carbonation tingle. Very smooth on the pallet with sweetness that livens up the mouth. Finishes a bit strong with the deep spices"
"Overall-a complex and flavorful, just approaches the limits of being too much to bear but it works. A well done beer."
"jd"
"D: A nice Belgian winter brew for the upcoming holiday season. The 10% ABV makes it a danger for those looking to rock n' roll with multiple bottles of Adoration. But, it's a nice, sweet sipper to enjoy with a friend, hopefully out of an Ommegang holiday mix-pack of bottes!"
"D: An extremely drinkable beer."
"For what ever reason Ommegang just never seems to impress me all that much. They make some good beers, but I don't know if I have had anything truly great. This is one of the weaker offerings I have had from them lately. Not bad at all, just kind of ho hum for me."
"Ommegang Adoration suffers from an overload of spices. Decreasing the total by at least 50% (and eliminating cardamom entirely) would have given this seasonal brew a chance to be truly special. Twelve ounces would have been perfect."
"Fun."
"Pours a deep brown with a small off white to tan head that sticks around for some time. The nose is a bit of a spice bomb, but everything is fairly well integrated, with strong notes of ginger, clove, anise, caramel, and some molasses. The taste is a bit more constrained, but the spices work together with the mildly sweet malt and a sturdy medium body. Good carbonation levels and a nice mixture of spice and alcohol."
"D: Strong flavored and well balanced."
"pics at http://definitionale.com/2010/11/25/tasting-the-ommegang-adoration-2010/"
"D: A big beer with big malt, spice and yeast. Full flavor disguises the abv so don't rush this one."
"this beer would not get a 4 on drinkability, but it's yummy!"
"Perfect beer to compliment a cool night."
"D: A whopper of a beer, with the full flavor and significant alcohol content. The anise and cardamom fire on all cylinders."
"A cooler than usual night seemed like an opportune time to break out this winter warmer. Nice amber / honeyed brown pour with a generous, but short lived beige head. Very astringent and medicinal herb laden smell - not something of which I am overly fond. Taste is huge bitter orange peel, and the mace is up front. Also taste some anise and the medicinal astringency. This is a big tasting beer - nothing sublte about this at all. The most redeeming factor for me is the mouthfeel. Very thick and smooth, this lends itself to gulping. Drinkability is a toss up. It goes down easy enough, but the aftertaste lingers, and is not pleasant. Jager anyone? As a winter warmer, this beer cannot be faulted. The alcohol is prominant, and is indeed warming. It is simply a question of how much herbal sweetness you can stomach in a beer. For me, a glass is fine, a bomber, a bit much."
"Notes: I normally don't like overly spicy Christmas beer but this one works. Overall this one is outstanding. It has many different layers of flavor and is never dominated by just one spice."
"Delicious. Not the best dark Belgian ale, but up there. Definitely worth picking up. Not something you'll be able to drink a lot of, though."
"Notes: The final of the three Ommegang beers that I tasted and rated this week."
"D: A great Christmas Belgian spiced beer. Don't know why I waited so long to try it, I love Ommegang and I love Christmas beers. A real treat."
"Overall - An excellent rendition of a Belgian Strong Dark Ale. Not quite a Quad, although the styles have been blended together these days. If it had just a touch more raisin then it would be perfect in my opinion. Nonetheless, it pairs very well with some sharp cheddar cheese and an apple! I would recommend this beer to any dark Belgian beer lover."
"Reminds me of the Anchor christmas offering, but less spice. The 10% is really apparent, but not distracting."
"Overall I'm impressed, Ommegang has yet to disappoint."
"Poured into a Watou glass a nice clean/clear dark amber/ruby color, nice carbonation, nice little fizzy off-white head, with some sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, with some yeast notes, dark fruits, banannas, and caramel. The taste is sweet, malty, yeasty, nice touch of dark fruits/banannas, and caramel. Medium body, the ABV is hidden very well for this brew. Very drinkable, this one is very nice."
"Drinkability isn't too high. This beer was both poorly designed and executed, and was a burden to finish."
"Appears a murky dark brown. The smell is very spicy which also comes across in the taste. In addition to the spice, there is also a light funk/barnyard taste. The beer had good carbination but the overall taste body of the beer was light and did not have much depth. I am not too sure I would seek this one out again."
"I'm not wild about this one and I'm glad the bottle was shared 3 ways. Just too much spicing for me, which made one glass plenty. A nice beer, but you have to like spices to have more than one."
"T-This has mellowed into a rich wonderful brew. My earlier review still stands, but damn this is good with a year of age on it (figure another half point on taste). The comparison to Mad Elf is still valid, but I had a fresh 2010 St. Bernardus Christmas recently and this aged Adoration blew its doors off. (Corsendonk? Fuggetaboutit!)"
"Compared to the other 3 BSDAs I've sampled this winter, I'd rank it as the strongest contender to the Corsendonk Christmas Ale. It's more substantial and warming and has more depth than the Mad Elf, and is more drinkable than the Delirium Noel."
"Extreme winter warmer? This is it. I don't really want to pan this brew, because if you love spices in your beer, you're going to love Adoration. But it's too much for me, way, way too much."
"[This doesn't change my review, but by the third glass it became a little better all-around, mainly in drinkability. Then again, that could be the alcohol kicking in.]"
"Overall I was pleasantly surprised by this beer. It's got a good level of spices balanced nicely by the choice of malts. Worth a shot."
"Adoration is a adorable dark ale bordering on black from a far but close up its a murky dark red color with brown. A off white head came and went, leaving nice scattered sheets of sticky lace. The smell is overrun by belgian spices and a orange slice. Vanilla, malt and some fruit. The aroma is big but it did not blow me away, spice overload. Taste is good for a BSDA but a bit unbalanced at times when cold, adoration evens out with warming leaving plums and raisins coming forth with caramel sweetness with apples, a nice mix. Some alcohol creepin in there at the end. The feel is smooth, no complaint's, went down like a charm. I may need to find a bottle of this."
"Awesome cherry wood and mahagony amber colors with dark ruby around the lighted edges of this brew. Very quick head for a Belgian brew, but thats ok. The aroma is sweet and bready with awesome xmas spice notes that let you know they are there, but not overwhlming. The sweet malts and spices are all very enticing. The taste starts with deep toasted and light roasted sweet malts. The addition of various spices add a cherry and fruit cake spice flavor to the middle. While the finish is a slow warming mlat and alcohol. THis is a defeinitive winter beer. Smooth, sweet, and warm palate that just warms your Christmas even after that awesome holiday is over. I'm going to pick up a few more bottles of this for sure."
"D: Drinkability was good, very enjoyable, more noticeable boozy when warm but was still manageable to drink, though you will feel this eventually. If you could capture this flavor in a 5.0%-6.0% abv beer it would be the ultimate session material. Wish I could drink more of this, more of the time, but that's what makes this so special. This should certainly go to the front of your winter warmer list on must try beers. It will warm your inner spirits with holiday cheer. Cheers."
"I like the concept of a Belgian winter warmer but the execution came off with just to many things going on. There are clashing flavors all over the place and it leaves me dissatisfied and that is a first by a beer from this usually amazing brewery."
"A really amazing brew."
"D-extremely sweet and candy like, great mouthfeel and well hidden 10% alcohol. I will definitely enjoy my 750ml's and would have another if present."
"M/D: Very warming. The body is medium, and the carbonation is prickly and jumpy on the tongue, which goes great with the spiciness. The half bottle (I split it with the lady) was enough for me, but I wouldn't have minded having the whole thing myself. I'm not usually a huge spiced Christmas beer fan, but this one gets the job done for me."
"I hate that this is a one off. I had a rough time finding it and now need to run out and grab a few more to hang onto (if I can manage to find them). If you see one, definitely worth a try (as is anything Ommegang)."
"D: A great drinking Belgian Dark from Ommegang. I'm a bit confused by the bubblegum I get in the aroma, but everything else is excellent. I'll definitely keep an eye out for this next Christmas."
"Pours a deep hazy orange. Has a nice puffy white head. Aroma of orange peel, spices, and other fruits. First sip is full flavor of malt, caramel, with candied fruit. Good carbonation and great full silky mouthfeel. Not a mind-blowing flavor, but a good solid dark Belgian ale. A solid offering from this brewery, and a good sipper on a winter night."
"Drinkability: At this early stage, the bold spiciness serves only to exacerbate the hot, fusel alcohol character of the beer. For me, this one definitely needs some time away in a deep, dark cellar to hopefully mellow."
"Special thanks to my beautiful wife Kat for buying this beer for my birthday. Pours a murky amber/copper color. Head looks like a Belgian beer with a slight tannish hue to it. As a spiced winter beer I am hoping for a pretty nice balance between alcohol, flavor, spices, malts, and hops. Pours slightly cloudy spiciness and sweet malt predominate the taste. A little bit of spices also adds a sweet and slight nutmeg character to the finish. Intersting beer, Rare Vos and Ommeggedon are my favorites from this brewery so seek those out as well."
"Mouthfeel is medium full, warming as it goes down with a slightly under carbonated feel. Extremely drinkable. While the spice character is perfect for this type of beer, overall Noels are not the type I would ever rate above a 4 in my personal scale, drinkability is something you can stand to have a few glasses of in an evening, even spiced well more than one would be too much on the palate."
"A very rich, complex brew. Truly a winter treat! Drinks well despite noticeable 10% abv."
"It had a silky mouthfeel with high carbonation, it tingled on the tongue. Shared with my mom but she didn't like it. It is a good example of a dark belgian."
"Poured into a tulip glass. Dark hazy chestnut brown with a light tan head that slowly disapates into nothing. No real lacing. Great spicy aroma, the corriander and mace stand out. I was shocked by the taste. Though you can really taste the spices it is not overbearing at all. This beer is very balanced and you would not even know it was high in alcohol content if not for the lable. What a great Christmas beer this was. Very enjoyable."
"D - Extremely drinkable, delicious and sweet ... spicey offering from the brew artists at Ommegang."
"Medium to full body, very enjoyable!"
"drinkability: Great Holiday belgian. Different flavor profile and a little lighter than the typical style."
"D - one of my favorite Winter seasonal's...a ton going on without being too spicy, too sweet, too bland. might benefit from a year or so in the cellar to cool down the alcohol and let the flavors mesh a bit, but i was very happy to have tried this 'fresh'."
"So rich. Pretty good holiday brew. Poured with a smallish off white head and a tiny bit a lace. Color is a hazy medium amber. Aroma is a very rich, heady, malty nutty, caramel, toffee. Flav is about the same. Body is good and so is carbonation. Finish is a little long. Not a session. Cook with it?"
"The first pour from the bomber was a brilliantly clear ruby color. Alcohols held the head formaiton and retention in check and with minimal lacing. Second pour was considerable more haze but with better head characteristics."
"Way too easy to drink for the abv, which is buried in the abundant character the palate offers. Quite a diverse brew, a modern day twist on a traditional style. Nice Warmer!"
"Strong ginger and Belgian flavors. Slightly sweet, but the spicy ginger takes over for the finish. Think true Ginger Ale. Rich body with an appropriate carbonation. Some darker malts, but it's the ginger the makes this brew. One of the best ginger beers I've ever had."
"A nice attempt and I like the base beer a lot, but it could use a bit of work. Luckily, being snowed in, I've got all day to work on this."
"Can't taste the alcohol so this one I rate pretty good in the drinkability catagory."
"D - I really wanted to like this, and the aroma had some promise, but it turned out to be awfully hard to drink. The spice character is overwhelming with a lot of cinnamon and clove. This somewhat stale and overdone spicing mostly covers up any pleasant yeast character that may be present, except for a hint fruit and pepper in the finish. I hate to say it, but this tastes like bad homebrew; the spicing is way overdone and it just kills every other aspect of the beer. I am not generally a big fan of spiced christmas beers, and someone who really likes that sort of thing might see this beer differently, but even considering that this beer was intended to taste like a spice cake, it is not well executed and just ends up being a cloying mess. Not recommended."
"Reviewed on 11/2/2009. Bottle. Pours brown with a small ring of white head. Aroma of spruce, dark sweet fruits, lots of spices (clove, anise, pepper, licorice). Flavor of sweet fruits (plum, raisins) with lots of spices and chestnuts. Dry, sweet finish. Good winter ale!"
"A lightly cloudy brew with light tan head of decent substance and somewhat less retention. Spots and streaks of lace along with a ring. No carbonation as it sits. A holiday spice cornucopia with all the stuff on the label, ( coriander, cardamom, mace, grains of paradise, sweet orange peel ) as well as roasted malts and Belgian yeastiness. Stuff not on the label as well. Cloves, pepper, ginger and faint cinnamon. A touch of sweet alcohol. Taste follows the nose with mocha and cocoa on the palate. A large dark fruit component, raisins, plums, dates, and figs. A relatively mild hop finish that still dries it beautifully. Alcohol show up adding fusel vapors and sweetness. Well integrated while showing itself. More roasted malts and dark flavorful breads with a cocoa liqueur as it lingers on my palate. Phantom overripe banana. Spiced as well. Feel is prickly and tingly carbonation with a just enough heft to satisfy. Introducing the yeast improves both taste and feel adding an integrating agent to the flavors and a silkiness to the texture. For a winter BSDA it goes down remarkably well. Quite drinkable and a joy to sip, though maybe a little quicker than you might."
"D- A strong robust seasonal offering that warms you up from the inside out. Tasty for sure with bold flavors and a kick. One and done for me, bit would recommend to try."
"M&D - spicy and poignant, and even with that it is super easy to drink, the orange zest addition balances it well, definitely worth the purchase if you can find it"
"D: decent, but nothing really unusual or outstanding"
"750mL bottle into an Ommegang 10th anniversary tulip pours a murky dark brown that shows orange highlights when held to light and sports a nice frothy off-white head that lasts as a thin layer and leaves slight lacing on the glass. Aroma is burnt toast, spices such as cinnamon and nutmeg, dried fruit and bananas. The taste is a nice blend of dried fruits, clove, and toast with a nice lingering cinnamon finish. The beer is somewhat heavy with warming alcohol, perfect for a cold blustery night like tonight has been. This is a very enjoyable winter beer, one I'd love to keep on hand for nights like this."
"Drinkability is good. Many would enjoy this, even multiple servings in an evening. A solid seasonal from Ommegang."
"Drinkability: I would definitely have this again on a cold winter night. I recommend this to someone who seeks a classic belgian yeast open with a malty concord grape middle and holiday spice finish leaving a warmth that is slightly dry. Worth the try."
"Drinkability: This is an excellent winter beer. The mix of spices is delicious. I want this again, but for the price I may not rush out to get it."
"Out of a 750ml corked and caged bottle. Pours a hazy honey chocolate brown color with a tight and creamy head that quickly settled into a solid cap. The aroma is sweet and spicy and very nice overall. The aroma has some banana, clove, and pepper spice. Lots of yeasty phenols, very weizenbock-ish. The taste is of a tart unrippen dark fruit, bubblegum, prune, light chocolate, cinnamon, light clove & nutmeg, quite boozy, and hints of a sprucey/holiday spice. The feel is light to moderate with very fizzy carbonation; sweet overall with raw booziness, finishes sour. Definitely needs some mellowing, ABV is a bit harsh. A sour BSDA, which is different, the abv is very hot so this needs some aging. Still has some nice flavors, like to see what a year does to this brew."
"Overall, another solid beer added to the Ommegang lineup. Give it a try while the season is ripe."
"Drinkability: A solid beer from Ommegang, though not an outstanding one, and one I didn't think particularly worth: 1) it's abv% level; or 2) it's price. It's worth trying once, perhaps, but only to say you have."
"Drinkability: alcohol kicks this down a notch. A real slow sipping beer that provides a nice warming feeling. Wonderful beer to enjoy over a longer period of time."
"Fantastic winter sipper. Balances fruit and spice, sugar and alcohol in the tradition of a classic brown liquor coctail. Should be even better next year when the alcohol is better integrated."
"D: Pretty high, as this is a high alcohol and relatively dry finishing beer."
"750ml corked and caged bottle served at 52 degrees in my DFH goblet. Poured a hazy garnet with ruby red highlights when backlit. A one inch, creamy, off-white head slowly recedes into a solid 1/8th skim. Thick swaths of lacing are revealed as the brew is consumed. Nose is spicy - grains of paradise and coriander come out, as well as a hint of citrus esters in the background. Taste follows nose - however, some nutmeg also comes out in the mix. Mouthfeel is medium-light, a little bit creamy, and a lively background effervescence. Definitely a holiday brew - closer to an intense winter warmer than a Belgian Strong Dark in my opinion. Very tasty and complex flavor profile; however, a bit too big and slightly cloying for a 750ml to be consumed solo. Best shared amongst three people. A nice beer to share on Xmas Eve."
"D- easy enough to finish but at this strength one is enough. a nice winter seasonal that seems to capture the tastes and smells of the season with a nice boozy warmness also. cant wait to see how this one ages."
"Would consider this a wonderful brew for the holidays."
"D: a delicious brew in celebration of the holiday season. Worth checking out if it is available to you."
"Thanks for sharing Jon. Great aromas, the mace abd ornange, ginger and yeast. Big head and lacey. Taste is decent, complexity of spices, pepper including black,cardamon,ginger,corriander, cloves, a littl chocolate, slows down drinkability to a sipper. Average plus mouthfeel."
"D: Does any beer go down easier than this? This stuff is like drinking silk. Highly smooth and drinkable."
"The beer pours a ruby red color with a thick frothy tan head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a wonderful dark fruit and spice aroma. It has a kick ass warming crystal malt scent with bits of orange peel and cardamom as well. The taste is awesome. It has an incredibly smooth flavor that boasts of pale, crystal, and roasted malts along with an excellent selection of spices that really compliment the dark fruit flavor of the Belgian yeast esters. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a very good beer. It's adequately spiced as well as having a great malt bill."
"drinkability: good"
"Ommegang's new Christmas offering is a must try for any Belgian dark ale fan. First had the chance to try this one at the sneak preview at the Craft Beer Fest and have been anxiously awaiting it's release ever since. Adoration did not disappoint. Enjoyed out of the bottle in a chalise. Pours a dark orangy amber with not a ton of head. Smell is rich and malty sweet with just a hint of sugary citrus. The first sip reminds you that this beer is 10%, but the alcohol does not overpower the other flavors. A nice sweet, spicy flavor with stronger notes of the orange peel and correander. The finish is smooth and sweet with those candy sugars. Very smooth, rich and full mouthfeel. It's definitely a beer to be appreciated over a long period of time, the flavor gets better as it breathes and warms up. The name is fitting, any belgian strong ale fan will adore this beer."
"Overall, a damn fine beer!"
"Any criticism for overspicing is totally valid, but I like it the way it is."
"You will not be disappointed in this beer."
"Overall this is another nice one from Ommegang. It's a little different, and that certainly makes it worth trying. Great for a cold winter's night, spicy and warming. I have another bottle of this I'll be saving for a night closer to the holidays."
"This is a Belgian Dark Ale brewed in the Belgian Winter style, so it is a spiced beer. Pours a hazy dark copper, light brown color with a 1/2 finger off white head with good retention leaving light patchy lacing. Spicy and fruity aromas- ginger, corriander, orange, cherry and candy sugar. The up front taste is of the spices, mainly ginger and corriander with some others mixed in which lead to some light hop bitterness and yeast with some vanilla with the spices fading out. Medium high carbonation, medium body there is a nice clean mouthfeel. Quite drinkable, the alcohol is noticeable but very smooth for 10%. The balancing of spice flavors is very nicely done."
"taste is smooth, spice, prunes, raisins, red grapes, pepper, some caramel, and a touch of cocoa, ends dry and a little bitter."
"I had a taste or two of this at the recent BA Belgian fest in Boston, glad to see it today at DeCiccos's in Ardlsey, NY. $13.99 for the typical Omme. caged and corked Belgian style bomber. (w/o vintage dating BTW.) Dark brown, cloudy, darker khaki head, huge initially, slowly, slowly turning to a thicker film, collar and then respectable larger blots of lace. Sweet malty nose with hints of rum, raisins, figs, dark ripe fruit. BSDA in feel, tasty and personality. More sweet malt, rum notes, raisins, figs, light smoke, chocolate, thoroughly delicious, w/ 10% nowhere in sight. Complex, tasty and oh so wintery good. High quality sipper. Seek out and enjoy"
"Outstanding. When winter comes, this is exactly what I want. Im going to go and raid the store and sock some away for a few more winters."
"Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied with medium to high carbonation. Pretty neat stuff but maybe a touch too spicy. I liked it though."
"Sorry to be a downer, but I would avoid this one and pick up Hennepin, Biere de Mars, Ommegeddon, or any of Ommegang's other spectacular brews."
"The current version is probably the most Belgain-like beer I've had from Ommegang to date."
"D - A strong dark Belgian that didn't win me over, might just have been the climate, but it has too much liquer effect with alcohol overdone, not one I would try again unless they sell it in bottles most likely."
