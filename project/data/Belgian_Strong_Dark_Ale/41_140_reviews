"Cloudy, has the typical dark Belgian aroma, I get some dark fruit notes...from 2013"
""
"Have had both on tap and from the 33cl bottle. The aroma is a spice and dried fruit combination that evokes alcohol soaked fruit cake. It pours brilliant deep reddish chestnut under a 2"" very white tan foam cap that slowly descends to a thick, lacy film. It enters the palate hinting of cherry that morphs to apricot backed by dark dried fruit (figs or dates but not prune) sweetened by dark sugar flavors with a bitter hop accent on the finish. The soft foamy texture is outstanding and is more apparent in the bottled version than on tap. The carbonation is above average and the body hovers around medium."
""
"Wish it was a bit spicier"
"Clear brown body with solid head.  Smell: caramelized malts, clean yeast, toastiness.  Tastes of caramel, dark candi sugar, coriander, pepper, peach.  Sharp carbonation and sticky body.  This is a tasty, straightforward holiday Belgian beer."
""
"Pours a dark brown with an off white head that laces the glass. The smell was full of dark fruit as well as cherries. The taste was heavy on malt in the beginning making a heavy beer, good for winter, with some semi sweet flavors like black cherry on the finish made a very refreshing brew. Would definitely get again."

"got it on sale in late january, but I would drink this anytime of the year."
"Overall: a fantastic beer.  It drinks damn easy for 8.5%.  I usually like a little more complexity, but this beer's subtlety is its personality.  Great."

"O: Extremely easy to drink with very well hidden alcohol. Very enjoyable and a great example of a holiday Belgian ale."
"2014 Christmas gift poured into an oversized chalice glass. Pours a slightly hazy brown amber color with nice thick off white head and okay lacing on the glass. Smells of carmelized brown sugar with dark fruit such as raisins, plum, fig, and dark poppy seeds. Has a spicy phenolic aroma with hints of black pepper. Tastes of the same carmelized brown sugar as in the nose. Seems to have a relatively significant upfront bitterness that lingers and really stings the tongue. Sweet tasting upfront with full bodied feel. Alcohol well in check. Overall, a very nice Belgian beer. Paired well with some turkey pot pie. Would be great as a winter warmer, for the holidays, or a nice celebratory beer with the corked & caged presentation."
"Pours nice and dark (brown when held up to a light), with a smooth, lacy (whiter than expected) head. More sediment than seems reasonable...I'll need to be careful with the rest of the bottles. Not as much of a smell off the top as I was hoping for, but it hits your tongue nicely and goes down smoothly with not much of a hint as to its ABV. Malty with a bit of fruity (mostly raisins) sweetness, just the way I like it. Aftertaste is a bit weak (I love a beer that lets its flavour linger), but this is a great beer while you're drinking it."

"Real nice Belgian dark that comes off more like a Christmas quad.  Excellent Belgian brew."
"Overall:  Great Beer!  One of my favorite Belgian Christmas beers in fact!  I love the fruitiness that this beer has which is balanced perfectly with its maltiness.  Absolutely delicious!!"

"Poured aggressively from a 12oz bottle that was about 40 degrees.  Huge amounts of creamy head.  Full 4 fingers or more that lingered significantly.  Had to wait several minutes for head to break and recede.  Beautiful deep ruby brown color.  I small malts like a loaf of fresh bread but not overpowering.  Not much else maybe caramel.  True Belgian Strong Ale.  Light bodied in the mouth.  Taste spices like cloves, nutmeg, caramel and hops.  Citrus buried in there as well.  Goes down smooth with no burn.  Hides the high abv well.  Winter Warmer on steroids.  Nicely drinkable.  Good change of pace beer from the fruit/vegetable beers and lighter than a heavy Russian Imperial Stout.  I like it but wasn't blown away.  $4.99 for a 12oz bottle."

"I was excited to share this bottle with my family on Christmas but it turned out to be a total dud.  Unfortunately, I have to review it as is.  I don't know if I would drop $10 on a bottle again to retry it but I'm hoping I somehow have another opportunity to do so."

"Pours a clear slightly red tinted brown with a thick, very dense and creamy in consistency khaki colored head; settles slowly leaving a sheet of thick lace down the glass. Smell: panettone (lightly yeasty bread, raisins, candied orange peel note), brown sugar, notes of cola and black cherry, mild earthiness. Taste: sugary plum, toasted and buttered raisin bread, fig; cola, clove, and orange notes. Dark fruit, toast, and mild earth in the finish. This is a great christmas beer."

"750 ml bottle into signature globe glass, best before 8/20/2015. Pours lightly hazy/cloudy deep reddish brown color with a 1-2 finger dense khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of big raisin, plum, cherry, fig, orange peel, caramel, molasses, toffee, dark bread, nuttiness, light chocolate, coriander, light pepper/clove, and herbal/yeast earthiness. Incredible complexity and balance of fruity/earthy yeast, spices, and dark/bready malt notes; with good strength. Taste of big raisin, plum, cherry, fig, orange peel, caramel, molasses, toffee, dark bread, nuttiness, light chocolate, coriander, light pepper/clove, and herbal/yeast earthiness. Slight earthy yeast spiciness on the finish; with lingering notes of raisin, plum, cherry, fig, orange peel, molasses, toffee, dark bread, nuttiness, light chocolate, light coriander/pepper/clove, and herbal/yeast earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity and robustness of fruity/earthy yeast, spices, and dark/bready malt flavors; with an awesome malt/yeast balance and zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a very smooth, moderately creamy, and lightly slick mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is an absolutely incredible Belgian strong Dark ale. All around amazing complexity and balance of fruity/earthy yeast, spices, and dark/bready malt sweetness; and very smooth to sip on for the ABV. An absolutely amazing offering. Love it every year."

"Had a 2013 release on 11/3/14.  Very tasty dart fruits and fig.   Full bodied and warms the belly very nice.  One of the best and most satisfying Belgian Strong Dark Ales I've had to date.  Will be buying the 2014 release soon."

"O: Very lightly spiced, if it is at all. Tough to tell if the spicy flavors are the real deal or if they are just products of fermentation. Either way, they contribute favorably to a very complex and drinkable brew. Flavors are strong and even rummy at times, but the texture is so airy and silky that it goes down all too easily. A great pairing with almost any holiday dessert you can throw at it."
"great Belgian dark. pours into tulip a brown to black color, lot of tan head. aromas are a bit musty and moldy with some dried fruit presence. flavors balance between sweetness of dried fruits like figs, dates, rasin, and spice notes, nut meg, brown sugar, cinnamon. medium/ full thickness"
""
""
""
"Quite possibly one of the best Christmas beers around. A deep mahogany with prominent beige head. Lots going on here: dark Belgian candi sugar, dark ripe fruits, hints of dates, brown sugar, and well balanced holiday spices. Very mild cocoa in the finish. Flavors are quite well pronounced, yet delicate and complements one another. Rich mouthfeel with ample carbonation. A beautifully crafted beer perfect for a cold winter night."

"Pours medium dark brown, light on the bottom, darker on the top. Thick 1/2 inch white foam, fluffy. Sweet candy cherry nose. Fruity too. Smooth belgian yeast taste that expands. Strong carbonation. Cola background. Nutty. Touch of booze mixed in."

"Picked this beer up on clearance in February, guess they were clearing it out. Wonderful looking beer, thick and rich looking with great head, exactly what I would look for in a great beer. And then the smell, just as great. Then wow, tastes just as great. Could be a little more interesting but very smooth and tasty. Tastes maybe 5.5 max and is 8.5, wow. Excellent. Overall a great beer that is a must try and one I will looking to pick up again."

"Very good beer. Comforting christmas ale without overpowering spice."
""
""
""
"O: This is one hell of a nice brew. Perhaps the best belgian christmas ale ever. Spices aren't out of control like most, they just provide a nice layer of complexity. Loads of awesome belgian candi sugar everywhere. Great complexity and balance. Drinkability is great as well. My only nitpicking is sometimes I get a plasticky taste in the aftertaste. It's sorta random. Maybe I should stop eating bubblewrap."

"'08 and '09 bottles thanks to Masterson for bringing these. Pour a barely hazy deep brown with a faint hint of red. Nice tan collar. Almost ne head. Aroma of caramel and some faint spice. Taste is sweet caramel, tough of dirty funk and that same slight spice. '09 is slightly sweeter. Really enjoyable aftertaste. Smooth sweet and a tough of grit in the mouthfeel. Low carbonation."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours an almost opaque super dark brown with a foamy dark khaki head that settles to a partial film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace slowly drip into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is of toasted malt, caramel, dark fruit, and slight spice aromas. Taste is much the same with malt and dark fruit flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of spice bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp and prickly mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer with a nice mix of malt and dark fruit qualities."
"O - I bought this last Christmas. It tastes very nice. I enjoy the fruitiness and spiciness of this beer. I really didn't expect much, and it was a wonderful surprise. I may get this again for next Christmas."

"O- My friend has raved about this beer for years. I went to a Whole Foods that offers alcohol and I saw this on the shelf. I grabbed the 2nd to last one and I am shocked I haven't made it a point to try this sooner. This beer is amazing & upon first taste it catapulted all the way to the top of my favorites list. If you find it...TRY IT"

"Overall, a very nice beer. I feel the burn sugar helps lend a bit of character to this making it more appropriate for the winter months. The Belgian yeast notes are a bit more restrained than in some other Belgian ales alowing the malt to shine through. Quite nice."
"Vey nice version of the style. Highly drinkable."

"The feel is very full, with a touch of sparkling carbonation that hits the throat lightly."

"Pours a dark brown with a slight ruby cast. Nice long lasting head that laces well. Malt and yeast nose with a touch of spice against a dark fruit background. Medium bodied with a creamy mouthfeel. Good carbonation. More flavorful than a typical trappist ale. Well balanced with the 8.1% alcohol perfectly hidden by the malt bill. Nice dark fruit flavor of raisins and figs with a touch of spice. Clean finish with residual notes of malt, fruit and alcohol."

"Better than any American rendition of the style, but a step below some of the other Belgians. A good beer overall that I'm glad I tried. Will be proud to have the bottle in my collection."
"O: The smell is quite nice - a nice array of dark fruits paired with great Belgian yeast esters. The smell doesn't quite have the punch or complexity that the aroma has. Overall good, but not great."
"I recently re-discovered this one at Brookline's Publick House, on draught. I subsequently picked up this 250mL mini-bottle, which I'm trying just chilled, served in a Chimay chalice. Best before end 20/08/15. Beer pours a rich brown color with an epic head of a lighter brown. Beer appears to be loaded with bubbles. Aroma is pretty subtle, but yeasty, slightly funky, and spicy. Spice (""natural"" spice, that is) comes through much more in the flavor, along with a really rich body, and a mouthfeel that is definitely not too heavy for this heady brew. This Belgian is unbelievably easy drinking due to its fantastic balance and complex flavors. You'll get drunk (or broke) long before getting bored of these."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is an excellent beer. I look forward to drinking another and will definitely be trying this in years to come."
""
""
"O: Everything comes together nicely in this beer, despite my lack of love for the yeasty aroma. Excellent and highly recommended."
"Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Pours a dark, hazy reddish amber with a massive light tan head with good retention and great lacing. Aroma of dried and fresh dark fruit, bready malt and an almost minerally spicing. Flavor follows, dominated by dark dried fruit, brown sugar, coriander and oxidation flavors. Finishes semi-dry with dark fruit, spicing and faint hops. Medium bodied. The bottle has a ""best before"" date of 2015, but serious online research does not reveal how that translates to bottling date. There is noticeable, but pleasant oxidation flavor here, so I'm curious how old the bottle is. A pleasant, but somewhat understated Belgian strong dark ale."
""
""
""
""
""
"Fuller medium body, decent carbonation, sticky and a bit heavy on the tongue. This fits in well with other Belgian Christmas beers I've sampled, and while still sweet, this isn't as cloying as some others (i.e., St. Feuillien)."
""
"Overall: Very good but maybe a little sweet. I wish the offerings from this brewery were easier to find around here as I'd love to try them all."
""
"Beer is medium-bodied, with high levels of fairly aggressive carbonation, giving this an at-first fizzy mouthfeel that quickly foams up on the palate to become fairly smooth and easy-flowing. Closes quite dry, with moderate stickiness remaining across the palate."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"was expecting a heavier brew but this is pleasantly in between a heavy and light, and slightly sweet with very little bitterness. although it's a warmer january evening here in SoCal, i can still appreciate the intent of the dark beer. i like the other corsendonks and this is my first time with their christmas ale. beautiful appearance- awesome head and great color below. great taste and a higher abv. absolutely serves the purpose!"
"A complex tasty, drinkable brew here. I have owned the glass for years and now I finally get to try the brew. It did not dissapoint; one of the best dark Belgian ales I have tried."
"Most beers of this style tend to be a bit overpowering to me, but not this one. Not too sweet, strong, or complex, this held its own on a cold night like this and had just enough to it that I didn't chug it down either. Recommended for those looking for a good Winter Beer that doesn't present itself as such!"
"Served from tap into a Trappe Door tulip. Poured a deep brown ruby red with a two finger off-white head that subsided to a half finger slowly. Maintained nice lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, spice, funky fruit, fruit, and wood. The flavor was of sweet malt, spice, fruit, alcohol, banana, funky fruit, and earth. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was a decent brew. There was quite a bit going on in this one that I usually enjoy about the style. However, there was also something that was rather odd and out of place on this one with the funky fruit aspect. What in the Hell was this??? Not that it tasted or smelled bad, but it was definitely strange to pick up on for sure. As far as the style goes this was a pretty good representation of what one would expect from it. Worth your time trying if you have not done so before or are curious to see if you can pick up on that funky fruit aspect I got."
"Will absolutely seek this out again next year."
""
""
"Brownish-ruby red colour, more than a finger of tan/off white head, good amount of lace as well. Smell is of spice and dark fruits, yeast and some spice, orange peel, touch of alcohol, cinnamon, raisin and plums and a bit of brown sugars. Taste is of dark fruit, yeasty with spices, orange peel, corriander, only mildly sweet with some sugars and a fruity aftertaste. Medium carbonation, medium- full bodied. Quite delicious, above average and something I had no problem finishing a 750ml of."
""
""
"Poured a huge head into a Duvel tulip glass. Very pleasant deep brown color held to the light. However, both the scent and the taste are far lighter than I expected. The most dominant smell I got was a watery, rusty scent, not particularly good. The taste is clean and smooth and strongly carbonated with a bit of spice and sweetness. A decent beer but far less robust than I expected."
""
"O - Although I can detect a bit of spice (possibly from yeast), this is not an overly-spiced Christmas ale that tries too hard. A supremely well-balanced beer. It is complex yet drinkable, dark and sweet yet not smothering. My hat's off to the brewers."
""
"O- Very good beer, looking forward to another soon"
""
""
""
""

""

"O - A nice Christmas showing from Corsendonk. Aside the Berdardus Christmas, this might be my new go-to."
""
""
"Taste-Sugared plums, spicy Belgian yeast, brown sugar, caramel, faint smoke and mineral finish. Excellent character and complexity. A great winter/Christmas brew."
""
""
""
""
"Poured into a chalice, this is a dark brown color with around half an inch of fluffy head. The smell is very sweet with some hints of plums, brown sugar, and cherry. The taste is a smooth mix of grapes and dark fruit with interesting twists like orange peel and lemon. Alcohol is hidden very well."
"O: delicious beer. Not quite up there with the best of the Belgians, but very good and a nice treat this time of year."
""
"Bottle dated 11/9/11. Purchased December 2011. Opened 12/28/12. Pours a cloudy brown-garnet color with a tall beige head. Mild aroma of figs, plum, and mild cinnamon. Taste follows: figs, dates, plums, and browned apple and some mild cinnamon and allspice, all stewed in a alcohol base. The 8.5% ABV is not real evident. Goes down juicy and smooth. Very nice."
""
"Christmas Ale poured a dark brown color, with a nice large brown lacing head. The aroma contained lots of spices, mostly sweet spices such as cinnamon. The taste was very full bodies, nicely carbonated, had strong hints of Belgian candy spices, as well as nutmeg and cinnamon. Good full body, and enjoyable to drink. Overall its a very good beer, felt it was a little overrated, but deffently enjoyable."
""
""
""
""
"This is a medium to fuller bodied brew with a modest amount of carbonation. It is a decent offering with a minimal zesty spiced influence that is just enough to set it off as being different from the standard belgian style strong ale. Overall not bad and it is something I would drink again if offered but not something I would have to drink to make my Christmas complete."
""
""
"A good holiday ale."
""
"One of the best beers I have ever tasted. Will buy more soon."
""
""
"Overall a solid, if somewhat one-dimensial, BSDA."
"At around $6.99-8.99 for a 750, I'd give this a solid 89-90 B+/A-"
""
""
""
"O: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, good kick, good representation of style, this is a solid beer to drink for a while if you’re in the mood for the style."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- A solid holiday beer, not one of my favorites but worth a try."
""
"O: An awesome dark strong with a great balance of flavors! This category is a bit challenging for me because I have a strong preference for drier beer which may factor into my enjoyment of this beer. That being said the flavors of fruit and spice blended with alcohol and brown sugar are all so nicely balanced without getting too sweet."
"O - Best By date? HA! This precious beer has been sitting in the basement for over 3 years and doesn't show any signs of degradation; instead, expanding on it's fantastic Belgian yeast characteristics wonderfully. Dark fruit and sweet nuances play off the dry, toasted malt for a nearly perfect dark ale that soothes with every sip, warming gently from within. Make this a Christmas staple. I think I'll have to get a large bottle for my celebration!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall- I like my winter spiced ales to have a little more pronouced flavors and smells. I do believe the fact that it was on tap may have its part in that."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Darker red-brown color, deep but clear, with a foamy khaki head that receded to a thin layer, leaving generous lacing on the glass. Aroma of dark sugars, light spice, orange blossom. Taste of caramel, brown sugar, cinnamon, cocoa powder, toasted bread, yeast, orange blossom, raisins, light floral hop notes. Medium body, moderate carbonation, fairly smooth, and a pretty pleasant drink overall."
""
""
""
"O: Overall, a very nice Christmas ale. All of the great Belgian Strong Dark's that come out this time of year is one of the many reasons winter its my favorite beer ""season"". This one is very good, but St. Bernardus Christmas ale still remains the king for me. This is one Ill be sure to come back to again next year."
"Classic Belgian ale. Enjoyable fresh and with age. Excellent late-night beer."
""

"O- Very nice Christmas beer! Excellent on tap, hoping to eventually find some bottles!"

"2006 vintage at Kulminator. Poured into a mini snifter. Low head and retention. Of course considering the age.  Dark, dark ruddy brown body. Aroma dominated by brown sugar, molasses, raisins, port and vanilla. Taste is malty sweet, caramel, vanilla. Low carbonation. Zero alcohol. None. This is a great example of why people have cellars. Perfect. "

"Taste is normal for a Christmasbeer, i have had better ones than this one but also much worser ones. Just a good brew in it's league."
""
"Sampling this from a 12 oz. bottle tonight. It's an average looking Belgian specialty ale. Nothing remarkable. Fast fizzy head that fades with a little lacing. It smells like watery cinnamon raisin bagels. Taste is wet with a definite Belgian cheesy funk from the yeast, reminiscent of swiss cheese. Some fruity plum backnote tang on the back of the tongue and not much else. It's wetter tasting than a lot of Belgians and it's not overly sweet. Overall, it's ok. I don't find it quite as good as a lot of other Belgians."
"2009 vintage, been cellaring. pours a redish hued sappy brown color, like a maple leaf. smells very boozy with notes of vanilla, sweet malts, and holiday spice. flavor peppers in some dried fruit tones and a big rich mouthfeel. not as carbonated as a fresh one might be, but it lends a nice mellow character here. belgian yeast floating around inside a little bit, imparting a slightly funky finish. good but not incredible holiday brew"
""
""
"Overall - A nice holiday brew to sit and sip in front of an open fireplace while relaxing and collecting your thoughts."
""
""
""
"Poured from a bomber into the Corsendonk Christmas Ale glass- pours an opaque nutty brown color. This beer is very active and has a two finger head with good retention and some lacing; the foam is a light tan color and creamy. It smells of yeast, malted barely and a hint of molasses and alcohol. This is a very sweet beer- it tastes much like it smells. The most wonderful part of this brew in my opinion is the full carbonation that supports the alcohol sweetness. It's very refreshing. Definitely a beer worth buying and something I would get again."
"A must drink for the beer advocate."
""
""
""
"Overall a great Christmas beer, one that I will look for again."
"Liked it, very subtle flavor, but works well as an X-mas ale."
"O- Great example of this style, definitely would go back to this beer"
""
""
""
"Pours brown with ruby hints. There are two healthy fingers of head (boy, is this a live beer) and the retention and lacing are top notch. The nose has an unpleasant cidery element to it. Malt and berries are the upfront flavors and the finish is slightly bitter with a dose of alcohol warmth."
"Definitely a nice sweet fruity beer. Not my favorite belgian strong dark ale but definitely up there with some of my favorite belgians."
"This is a very nice Christmas ale. It's complex in both flavor and aroma and feels good going down. I would buy this again next season."
"Overall: It really made the perfect Christmas gift. A beer to savior."
"o - very complex and delicious seasonal."
""
"Poured a wonderfully dark brown, near-black with fantastic head and awesome lacing. Great thick malt scents, with a wonderful bit of fruit (cherry) and spice (nutmeg) in the nose. A great strong dark ale with Christmas flavors, it had wonderful fruitiness with some cherry and orange flavors, nice spices with a low hit of cinnamon and nutmeg, and a great bit of hoppy spiciness as well; all flavors were well balanced. Slightly rough with some of the spiciness on the way down, along with just a bit of alcohol heat, but a fantastic beer nonetheless!"
""
"O- You can't ask for much more in a Belgian winter ale. Not a lot of Christmas spices or herbs but still memorable and comforting"
""
""
""
""
"Half finger head, on a clear dark amber and red body. Not much lacing. Aroma is almost nonexistent. What is there is a mild pungent and sour grape like aroma. this is a very drinkable mild dark fruit Belgian dark strong. A very safe member if the genre. Medium in body and moderate carbonation. Overall may be my least favorite in this genre. These beers should be bold, this one is weak."

"Corsendonk off the spout has a amberish hue hinting towards polished brown. a trace amount of dark tan foam up top, leaving squiggles around the glass that fade. Smell is pretty spicy and caramel, sweet ridden. Get alot of toffee, with some winter spice on top of some grain and a whiff of alcohol. Not all that impressive in all honesty. Taste pretty much solidifies my fears, Corsendonk Christmas really ain't about nothing. Sure it has some winter spice with caramel malt/toffee. I even get some faint applesauce taste and plum. It just comes down to, I don't like it all that much. It does not move me. The alcohol is hidden really well though, so there is that. Body is pretty dead on arrival, just feels like some life was lost on this. Medium in build, light in carby. While this was a beer I got into good beer with, it's not one that will be sticking around for me."

"11.2oz. bottle served in my St. Bernardus chalice. Best before 21/09/14 indicated on the back label. Pours a deep mahogany with a dense, fluffy, 1.5 inch, cream-colored head that eventually settles into a sold, quarter inch cap. Sheets of lacing appear on the tilt side of the glass leaving residual spots and strands of lacing as it disperses. Nose reminds me of concord grape jelly off the bottle pop; however this dissipates into a faint vinous quality. Yeast and a light earthy/herbal quality add a complementary component. Taste follows nose; however, I also get a slightly metallic character in the flavor profile towards the back which somewhat kills it for me. Mouthfeel is light-medium in consistency with a pleasant, easy carbonation and a slightly creamy texture. Overall, a decent BSD; however, the metallic flavor really negatively impacts an otherwise good brew. That said, alcohol is really well-hidden at 8.5%. I've been wanting to try this beer for a while but I have to say that I'm a little disappointed."

"This was a very good beer, very nice flavor. I may add this to my list of must have holiday beers."
"Relative to other beer from Corsendonk, this is rather uninteresting: it has a flat flavor that wants to be like the palen but doesn't quite have the muscle or the yeast. Relative to other christmas-themed beer in general, however, this is spectacular because it isn't larded with spices and herbs. It's mildly fizzy and has a decent, if understated maltiness that could use a bit of a boost in the flavor and the density. I would like to have had a bit more warmth and zing; nonetheless it's worth a single bottle. I wouldn't invest in a four-pack."

"The taste is malty and robust with some breadiness as well. Also present is candied sugar hints of dark fruits and toffee. Drinks very easily and smooth."

"Overall a great beer. I will buy this one again, probably soon...since the wife tried it and wouldn't give it back....so I only got to drink half of the beer :-)"
"Overall, a beer worthy not only as a christmas ale but would be great as a christmas gift. This is a brew to share with someone you love during the holidays."
""
"O- I liked it- an enjoyable and unique beer. I might have to tuck a few of these away for some emergency holiday cheer."
"Slightly sweet fruity taste with malts and spices. Its pretty darn tastey and a great christmas brew...although it does leave me hangin a bit. Its missing that little something..."
"Overall a fantastic Christmas beer that rivals the best. Highly recommended."

"Picked this up at my favorite beer store in Belgium, Dranken Geers. Clear mahogany pour with two finger head and decent retention and lacing. Loads of malt in the nose with hints of brown bread, molasses, brown sugar, and a touch of dark fruit, with a bit of bubble gum and cloves emerging as it warms. The taste is much the same with prunes and sweet brown bread dominating. I'm also getting hints of toffee, tea, caramel and cloves. The mouthfeel is slightly syrupy, but incredibly smooth and drinkable for the ABV. A very impressive Christmas beer."

"D - A highly enjoyable Belgian Strong Dark Ale and holiday seasonal... Lots of good things going on in nearly ever facets with good complexity and sophistication... A nice drink to unwind with after a long day... Perhaps this one is just a bit cloying which detracts slightly from on overall solid offering..."

"The beer is a chestnut brown hue with hints of sunburst orange. The head is a light tan color, leaving plenty of lacing on the goblet. The aroma offers yeast, malt, alcohol, brown sugar. The flavor is distinctly Belgian. A bit sweet, but balanced by a bready, yeast character. Spritzy carbonation and medium bodied. A solid beer. I would definitely have this again."
"Pours a dark amber/brown w/ an amazing two finger cocoa head. Very good lacing on the side of my snifter glass. Nose is cinnamon, nutmeg, brown sugar, and molasses. Very nice, although I'd like it to be a little stronger. Taste is very nice- toffee, bread, nutmeg, cinnamon and coriander, w/ a little brown sugar and molasses. Very complex in character- a step up from the nose. Feel is medium bodied w/ nice carbonation, as well as a nice aftertaste. Overall, this is a really solid brew. Probably my second favorite Christmas ale. Cheers."
""
"Taste is a bit thin, but still enjoyable. Caramel, sweet, holiday spices. Yum, but Christmas beers are my favorite and this isn't my favorite of those."

"Overall this is good for the style and a good beer. I'm curious to try one that hasn't been aged. I think I'm going to pick up a 2011 bottle and compare, and add it to this review."

"O- A nice belgian strong dark ale, lots of big fruit flavors and nice spice presence. Metallic finish on the beer brings this down some for me. Overall, a really nice beer to sip on a cold night."

"O: I still enjoy this beer just as much as I did the first time I tried it. This is a near prefect strong dark ale."
"O: nice, welldone, but not the real top in this style."
"O: Very good, nice balance as well as variety of flavors. with that said, i don't love it but others will."
"I got a finger of deep-tan head with good retention off of my very gentle pour. Color was a solid garnet with NE-quality clarity. Nose smelled of maple syrup, anise, milk chocolate, toffee and some mustiness. Mouthfeel was absolutely creamy and the taste was of Sugar Babies (caramel enrobed in milk chocolate) and it was MUCH more pleasant than my last encounter with those candies. I was still pre-teen, but I had had several cavities filled (and none since), but those candies ripped out the bottom two for the second time (!), the first time from Jujubes, another candy that I have not touched since. Finish was warm, not hot as the heat had had some time to die down, with a continued caramel/chocolate flavor and even some coffee on the extreme finish."
"This beer poured out as a nice looking reddish brown color, the head was fluffy and tan in color. The lacing was a little sticky and hung around for a little while. The smell of the beer has a pretty typical Belgian aroma to it, It's yeasty, sweet and has a slight roasted aroma to it. The taste of the beer has a good sweet malt character to it that's balanced with a spicy aftertaste. The mouthfeel of the beer gives off a pretty good warming sensation as yu drink it. Overall I think it's a good Christmas brew, worth checking out."
"-Cheers"
"O - Awesome. I could drink these regularly, without a doubt. This has to be my favorite Christmas beer."
"O: A great beer, probably my favorite christmas beer. This beer and Troeg's Mad Elf are my favorite Xmas beer because they aren't heavily spiced with cinnamon and similar spices/flavors that a lot of american christmas beers have. The alcohol doesn't detract at all. It is slightly evident but doesn't detract at all. I like this beer a bit more as it had warmed up, and as I get closer to the bottom of the bottle. It is malty without being overly sweet and has a great hint of fruit(orange) in it. Will pick up a few more bottles for sure before they disappear from the store I got this bottle from. This is a christmas 2010 bottle."
"This is a very nice Belgian Ale, look forward to enjoying again."
"From the massive display of head to the inviting brown darkness, this ale warms you just by looking at it. Coriander, cake batter and a peppery herbal spice from the alcohol and yeast infiltrate the nostrils. Smoothness borders on silky, and crispness pops off the full body. Fruitcake of the homemade variety, chocolate-covered oranges, bitterness from the coriander and hops, and hints of carob powder and charcoal make for a very complex brew. Top shelf all the way, a bottle of this is a real treat for the taste buds. By far one of the best winter seasonals on the market."
"But then again, maybe it's just the bottle I got?"
"Atmosphere is nice. Appearance is a great brown tone, with a solid foamy head, and some really nice lacing. Nose has a nice grain and nut profile with some hints of sweet and spice. A thick syrupy body, and a really nice combo grain, sweet, and spice combination. Nothing really stands out. Well balanced. Overall, this is a really good quaff."
"The palate opens spicy and fruity with a bit of burnt sugar and cola. Again, the prunes and molasses come through, but this isn't a sweet beer. Quite the opposite, this finishes quite dry. The mid-palate really carries the fruit, and coupled with the strong yeast character, it brings to mind an almost tropical fruit-like intensity. As it warms, the malt complexity does grow, getting a mild dark caramel character to go with the prunes and burnt sugar.Dry with an earthy, leathery malt character, the alcohol is very well hidden here. Spicy and yeasty on the finish, this beer is medium-light on the palate with a high level of carbonation, much higher than I care for, REALLY foaming up in my mouth. This does get distracting fairly quickly, and this is this beers only significant flaw. Solid stuff, I would not hesitate to drink this again."
"Great taste, OK feel, and an alcohol content that's not too high make this a beer you could sip all night."
"Poured from 750ml bottle into heavy chalice glass. Pours a transparent dark red with a real nice off-white head with very good retention. Excellent lacing. Very malty, spicey, and fruity aroma. Real nice malt flavor up front. Kind of a creamy, caramel, and fruit combination. Finishes rather spicey with a little clove that continues to linger in aftertaste. Hops are only very subtle. A touch of metal keeps this from being an even better beer. One of the better Christmas brews I've had."
"D - Drinkability is high. An incredibly easy drinking beer that has great flavor to it. Would've liked the aroma to be a bit more ... bold, and maybe something to distinguish itself as necessarily 'Christmas', but I really enjoyed this one."
"Had this on tap at Crescent & Vine in Astoria. It reminded me of the St. Bernardus Christmas Ale, though this was a touch more drinkable. My only complaint was that the spice dominated the aroma. The flavor was more balanced with dark fruits, caramel, coriander and citrus notes."
"Drinkability: Good beer but not one I could drink many of in a session."
"D - Great mouthfeel and taste and that clumpy head all work together for a very enjoyable strong dark ale."
"I recommend the Mahar's Pub in Castleton on Hudson, NY. It is a small neighborhood off-shoot of the long term, well established Mahar's Pub neighborhood pub on Madison Ave. in Albany, NY. Both Mahar's are serious places to drink a huge international variety of great beers."
"D: Flavorful and interesting, very pleasant."
"For me, this was very much like drinking a barleywine. A very incredibly smooth one. This one had a good bit of age. The beer is from 2008, so I'm wondering how age affected this beer."
"D: a great Christmas beer at an awesome price especially when a glass is thrown in. A quick christmas buy again."
"This is just so good. Come, you must try it!"
"D: This is delicious, but definitely a one and done sort of situation."
"Thanks for the birthday gift BeerFM Andy! www.beerfm.com"
"D: This is definitely delicious and a pleasure to drink but it is not as complex as it seemed in years past."
"D: This is very refreshing. Finally a Christmas drink I can enjoy! Glad the gift pack came with 6."
"Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. A very nice Belgian Christmas beer."
"Nice-- I'll probably have to wait until 2011 for another try at this seasonal beer."
"D: Heftier than its 8.5% would suggest...a definite sipper. Lovely on a winter's eve. Probably my favourite Christmas ale yet."
"Merry Christmas!"
"Thanks to Ratman for bringing this one to the Christmas party. Very impressive presentation in the 3 litre bottle; not sure we would finish it, but we did so rather quickly. Poured a clear ruby brown with a small, lasting amber head. Aroma was malty and spicey. Palate was medium bodied and dry. Flavors of sweet malt, spices and a bit of fruitiness with a dry finish."
"D - Keep this one coming."
"The mouthfeel is on the dry-side, delightfully round with a alert carbonation while some alcohol reveal itself in that of a warming manner. Smooth and very pleasant to the palate. Mild, but not weak, very simple yet balanced."
"D: Good beer and I'm glad I had the chance to try it. It's not to sweet, but I'd of liked to taste some more spice."
"Aftertaste: This beer went down really smooth was creamy on the palate with a flavor that lingered around for a while. I would suggest drinking this beer slowly the warmer it gets the more the taste really present themselves."
"This is a highly drinkable, and also a highly deceptive beer. The alcohol is almost undetectable. I cant believe how many times Ive passed by this one; I'm glad that I finally tried this gem."
"D: The beer is extremely easy to drink - any traces of alcohol arde barely perceptible and the beer goes down very smoothly."
"A really nice balanced holiday Belgian...I definitely would like to get a bottle or 2 of this."
"Overall: Decent, nothing special among the christmas beers."
"Drinkability is decent, sweetness is balanced well, not much for a boozy taste, and smooth drinking for the most part."
"D: This was kid of bland, but it still tasted good enough. Body was excellent, and the alcohol was well hidden, so it was very easy to drink. Not sure if age would help, but it was enjoyable fresh. Good holiday Belgian if you're looking for something simple, instead of the other holiday Belgians that are so deeply rich and complex."
"Drinkability: a nice xmas beer to slowly sip in front of a roaring fire. Definitely worthy of a try."
"Can probably be matured for a while to really peak."
"(D)- I look forward to this one every year when it comes out. A great Belgain Dark that has everything you should expect for the style. Tasty and easy to enjoy without being too rich or filling."
"Well carbonated, almost fizzy to be honest, but not quite. The alcohol is hidden nicely and the beer is very easy to drink. I like Corsendonk beers, whoever brews them!"
"Red in colour with a huge cream-coloured head that lasts and lasts. The smell is of dark malts with some yeast. The taste is malty with a hint of charcoal and fruitiness at the end. Very nice, but not the most complex Belgian strong. This beer is thick, foamy and very drinkable."
"D-Based on the reviews I was reading I feel like I was drinking a totally different brew. Not a huge fan of the regular Corsendonk either, so maybe this brewery is just not my thing."
"D - Good enough to make this chilly night feel not so bad. A great winter warmer."
"Notes - A wonderful holiday brew. Its biggest weaknesses have nothing to do with the actual drink: the bottles are too small, and it's only available at Christmas. Time to stock up!"
"Would that all Christmas ales were this splendid."
"Not a bad, though I can think of plenty other winter ales I'd pick over this. Not as complex & flavorful as I'd like, & that heaviness just drags."
"D: I will return to this... just not for my next pint (unless, of course, it was offered to me for free). The muted scents, the moderate yeast presence, and the slight touch of alcohol burn are the only things standing between this and a really BIG score from me. As such, it's good, but not perfect."
"D: Definitely could have another on a cold winter night. Though past that would not be a good idea with the 8.5% Definitely makes it on the list of favorite seasonals though."
"This is a celebration ale so I don't mind the spice in the palate, its subtle and in the background rather than flogging you with it. This is a really nice beer. Its light in body, sweet and has some yeasty breadiness to it at the end. I would have it again."
"The taste is very light roast with a bit of mild dark fruits. Very light amount of black licorice. There is also some light caramel and toffee. Medium body and light carbonation. Not a stellar brew, but pretty good."
"For style, it isn't one of my favorites. I look to these beers to be more flavorful....this one doesn't excite me. In fact, it's rather hard to drink."
"The consistency of this brew is kind of like champagne. Very carbonated and medium to full in body. Not really warming in the end, which is a good trait."
"This is a very good beer that is well crafted. It is most definitely an after dinner beer with the sweetness to it."
"This was a good beer and one that I wish I had more than one bottle of. It would be drinkable any time of year with a wide variety of foods. The mouthfeel is refreshing and yet the body was strong enough to be enjoyed during the coldest part of the year."
"Very drinkable for a big beer. Just as enjoyable on a cool summer night as it would be as a winter nightcap. A very tasty and accessible Belgian."
"Notes: This is an A+ beer, not only in the style of beer, but across all brews. The best part about winter is the big heavy beers that are released and enjoyed. This bottle was popped open not only on a bitter cold day, but also a long workday full of manual labor and cleaning. Perfect end to the day."
"Highly drinkable, my only regret is that I now have another great beer to fit in amongst the other good Christmas ales out there come December. Thank goodness for Christmas in July!"
"Drinkability: Smooth and very pleasant to the palate. Mild, but not weak, more so ""moderately distinct", that is to say: balanced. More please!"
"Very nice enjoyable winter ale that was sweet, fruity and delicious. As it warms up it gets sweeter and more complex, but was not too sweet. A great Christmas Ale that was a very good beer to sip and savor."
"D: This was a sipper because it does come across as a big beer from the bold flavors and aroma. This just resonates Christmas in flavor and aroma to almost perfection. The only negative I can give it is that the feel was a bit light. Otherwise, this is a wonderfully enjoyable beer. Glad I finally got a chance to drink it and the suprise in finding it made it that much better. I will absolutely be looking for this next Christmas to enjoy and cellar."
"Damn this is some good stuff, always passed by the $18 4-packs and was glad to see this on the singles shelf. Worth every penny, a fantastic Belgian Strong Dark Ale."
"Good, but not great."
"D-A very appropriate Christmas and winter holiday beer. It certainly hits the spot with a pleasant complexity."
"Sugar and spice and everything nice in this Christmas ale. It's one of the better winter brews I've had this season. Very enjoyable."
"D: winter warmer, such rich flavors, but i dont know about the best christmas ale i want some spice in my christmas ales. goes down like water. at 8.5% wow. I bought 2 bottles one i will bust out next christmas. but this one is is a base line I hope this one ages well."
"D: The ale is big, not one that I'd want to drink from a 750 mL bottle. The fullness of the flavors is excellent, rich and satisfying."
"Medium to full bodied with a rich creamy mouthfeel. Overall a great Christmas beer that can be enjoyed anytime of year. The alcohol is hardly noticeable at all. One of my favorites every year."
"This is one of the best beers I have ever had. Pours (into snifter) dark with decent head smells like christmas, tastes like christmas - some spice nutmeg clove - some fruit - subtle brandy - all delicious. Creamy and carbed nicely - warm - very drinkable for its abv."
"D: Flavorful and balanced. Really nice beer."
"This tasty brew goes down really easily. It's a shame that it's only around during the Christmas season."
"D - This is a Christmas ale that does not disappoint. Fabulous on tap. It was a thrill to find it at Cafe Hollander."
"D - A very nice offering from Corsendork."
"D-This goes down surprisingly easy and the carbonation is a big factor. This is a pretty complex beer but a personal yearly treat."
"d- this is one drinkable belgian, i'm not sure how many i'd have just because of availability and price so one for a special night is good for me. this is a christmas ale that i'll be picking up yearly for sure."
"D: An excellent beer that's best consumed in small doses. Definitely worth a revisit next year."
"I'm sorry that I didn't find this beer until after Christmas but from now on this will be a Christmas staple in my house."
"The bubbly head atop of dark brown garnet fluid quickly dissipates forming soapy sheet that disintegrates further into floating patches of agglomerated bubbles. The nose reveals citrus alike aroma that probably originates from copious use of coriander. Thin and crispy with well hidden alcohol the beer is bitter-sweet like a nutmeg and gives an impression of being heavily spiced with coriander and perhaps a warming sensation yielding black pepper. Flavor profile ends with lightly bitter hoppy finish with some dryness. This brew is overly spiced: the qualities of underlaying beer are entirely masked by generous additions of condiments. Spices should enhance the beer not subdue it.Thus I cannot say much about BSDA that served as a platform for this xmas ale - my guess is that brewers used a bit fortified Corsendonk Pater and enriched it with tons of additaments. Not impressed - Corsendonk xmas is like a woman who exaggerates with makeup - instead of stressing out her beauty she looks like a painted clown."
"It has a solid mouthfeel with lingering bitterness. I find it drinkable but not quite as smooth as could be. The carbonation seems lingering and for the type of beer it is I almost would like it to be a bit less so. But otherwise a very well rounded Christmas beer."
"'Christmas Ales' can belong to any category of beer styles, but if we were to lump them all together as a group I'd say that Corsendonk's would be among the standouts. Part of this is because I find that slightly stronger, heartier, spiced ales tend to be better suited to the holidays but mostly it is because this happens to be one of the more distinctive, flavourful, finely crafted ales I've had in Christmases past, present (and very likely) future."
"The initial swirls revealed an aroma of cherry brandy, yeast, dark fruits. Taste was initially of dark and slightly sour fruits; with air there were hints of prune tort, a fair bit of caramel, molasses, candied dry cherry, overall impressions on the sweet side. Mouthfeel was superb with a silky texture, good balance with residual acidity kicking around and just enough malt. Nice long finish had muted cherry brandy and more dark fruit. Alcohol very well handled. Tasty indeed and much appreciated, thanks Jan."
"D: Along with Anchor's OSA, this may be the prototypical holiday beer. Good stuff."
"Overall a wonderful way to cap off my christmas eve. Actually I wouldn't mind capping off any night with this beer."
"Very easy drinking and very tasty."
"A beautiful mahogany color with a huge, light tan head. Little lines and dots of lace coat the sides of the glass. A stream of bubbles push north from the nucleation site. The aroma is oddly complex. Fruity esters, tart Belgian yeast, cinnamon, ginger, raisins, plums, and clove. I almost get a little bit of port wine. A sturdy malt base with earthy, dry hops allow all the flavors to dart and dance around. Most similarly resembles raisin bread and ginger cookies. A complex, beer for sure. Medium body with a creamy mouthfeel. Easily drinkable."
"I typically don't like christmas ales but this one, as the style suggests, drinks more like a belgian strong than a christmas. If you like belgian strongs but not christmas ales, this one is good for you. I'm not crazy about either but still enjoyed it. Good across the board, but not great at anything. Very dark in color, good fruit aroma and flavor. Especially good on draft on a cold afternoon."
"This is a fantastic brew, for lovers of Belgian Stong Dark ales. This one is highly drinkable, downing a whole gift pack of these would be feasible, though you'd be feeling it."
"Overall, a little disappointing. I imagine it will get a little better with age. It probably wouldn't hurt to serve it at a warmer temperature."
"D: Not the best Belgian strong dark ale, and not very ""christmasy"". I'll buy a Trappist one next time."
"D: A drinkable beer if there ever was one. AN extremely well-constructed Belgian Strong Dark Ale that's one of the best I've had in the style."
"Pours a dark brown, red molten color, 1 inch head, decent stagnant lace frothy reminance. Smells of molten sugar, dark malt flavors. Tastes very spicy, cinnamon, nutmeg, honey, complex trying to mask the dark fruits. Not as good as expected (not being much of a holiday beer guy, although with respect to other holiday brews this is the best), but its definitely worthy. Must try it."
"Mouthfeel is creamy and pleasant."
"A very complex malt mixture with a slight sting at the end of spices. The overall flavor reminds me of the Allagash Double I had months ago. There is certainly a chocolate and caramel flavor without any of the weight I imagine comes with these flavors. Very light and drinkable for the ABV and I wish this was cheaper and offered in six packs."
"This is the 3rd Christmas themed BSDA I've sampled in the past 2 weeks along with Troegs Mad Elf and Delirium Noel and although I enjoyed them all, this is easily my favorite. Fuller in appearance, taste, and body than the Mad Elf, (although the Mad Elf is glorious to look at in the glass) and at the same time thinner and more drinkable than the Delirium. The Corsendonk strikes the happy medium. Perfect for our first truly frigid, (19 degrees) snowy night of the season. The 8.5% AVB is quite enough alcohol for the 750, thank you!"
"Really exceptional brew. Great all the way through."
"Bottle at least 2 years old. Wow, what a treat. Pours brown but deep copper when backlit. Huge, creamy tan head, great retention, and some patchy lacing sticks around. Very active and surprisingly clear. SMELL is of dark fruit, malty sweetness, and some light boozy esters initially. Spiciness emerges later. Very long legs and gets better and stronger. TASTE is a sweet malty base with light spiciness, dark fruit, Belgian yeast character and a mild bitterness late. Wicked smooth and very tasty. FEEL is thick, rich, full bodied and viscous. Alc warming bites a bit. Mostly clean, slightly bitter finish. OVERALL Very tasty, smooth, rich, balanced and complex. Extremely enjoyable. Get some and cellar it if you can."
"M/D: Medium body, a bit over-carbonated for the style (not extremely though) but very smooth on the palate and easily drinkable for being such a high gravity beer."
"Not a big fan of the style, though this might change my mind. Not a bad beer, just not my thing."
"This is a very enjoyable beer to drink, but sharing between a couple of friends was nice. I could drink the 750ml bottle by myself, but it might've been a bit of a chore."
"Mouthfeel/Drink: Full bodied with a good carbonation. Very drinkable."
"I could drink these all night. Now this was aged 1 year and I do prefer it this way, but it's good fresh too!"
"Summary: Mouthfeel on this one is the thing that sticks out to me. Taste is good but nothing out of the ordinary for a belgian dark"
"Absolutely a great beer that has so much going on it's hard to describe. I'm very impressed and I'm going to look for more to stock up on."
"Nice beer!"
"Pours a clear mahogany with a thick a thick, off-white froth. The nose is sweet with cinnamon, brown sugar, pie crust, baked red apples, caramel, cherry pie filling, cranberries, subtle raspberries. There is a little alcohol sweetness on the finish, but a long finish a great carbonation/mouthfeel. Overall a fantastic brew that really helps put me in the mood for cold days, warm fires, Christmas lights! One of my favorite Christmas beers to date."
"The mouth was mostly thin for the color but did have some silkiness on the tongue. The alcohol is a bit too high for many of these but it's a really good sipping beer."
"The flavor is sweet bready malt with that same white peppery spiciness. Other notes are of cinnamon, clove, and molasses. Alcohol is well hidden and I detect Belgian yeast character. The beer is medium bodied with a very high level of carbonation. This is a great Christmas beer. Highly recommended."
"Reddish brown with a medium white head, decent lacing. Little aroma, but what's there is pleasant enough. Full mouth, very smooth vanilla flavor with a long-lasting cocoa finish. Some notes of roasted dark coffee. Second best of a nine beer tasting at Belga."
"I'll definately be waiting to buy the 2009 vintage of this wonderful beer. This is a wonderful beer, a true treat for the holidays, or any other time for that matter."
"CHEERS!!"
"D- One easy drinker here. I'm sure this will pair well with a Christmas meal. Good beer but nothing over the top about it."
"Pours a dark brown body with a thin head. The aroma is nutmeg, brown sugar, yeast and raisins. Flavor is a balanced blend of spice, malt, and yeast with a syrupy, full body. This is a solid holiday offering that really improves with age. Not too spicy, a good brew."
"A solid mahogany color, dark but clear with a decent light-oatmeal color head and fair lacing. The aroma is raspberry-apple with root beer malt, light but definitive. The flavor brings a new element of heavy toffee malt and sweet licorice, more berry highlights and rice and almond hints. Sort of fizzy with a somewhat viscous feel, yet reasonably drinkable for a Christmas brew. An enjoyable selection, holidays or otherwise."
"All in all a solid Belgian ale, but nothing that I'm going to seek out again."
"drinkability: a nearly perfect beer."
"By and large the best Christmas beer that I've had this year. It helps that I picked the bottle up from Binny's in Lakeview, and it had been aging for a year on their shelf. Lots of nice vanilla and cocoa, a touch of cherry, some brown sugar, and a little bit of raisin. A slight carbonation tingles as it goes down, typical for most Belgians. A great Christmas beer, highly recommended!"
"A great beer."
"Poured a leather couch brown with a tawdry two-finger tan head that left lacing down the glass. A great smell of roasted malts, chocolate and bread along with some spiciness. Smooth, slightly creamy and medium-bodied with a mix of some fruits, both dark and tart, and a great balance w/ some sweet malts (caramel and chocolate mostly). This leads to an easy-going and warming brew (the ABV is hidden well) that has a slightly tart, dry finish to complement the overall sweet, silky texture of the beer as it passes over the tongue. This is a great X-Mas beer, as it is one you can sip on and it warms you up on a cold night."
"M&D: very tasty indeed, this big dark ale treads exceptionally light with the help of refreshing but ""spongey-textured"" fizziness; it also benefits hugely from a complex spicy-fruitiness due to the work of hops and yeasts. With such little hint of alc. shown on the palate, this is a highly-drinkable and reasonably complex dark ale suitable for any occasion and all seasons!"
"Drinkability: This has an easy drinkability if you sip slowly. But don't let the ABV sneak up on you while enjoying the feelings of warmth and good flavor."
"Mineral characteristics make this beer stand it's own ground among the big players in Belgium. A solid Belgian Strong Dark just starting to touch on oxidation after close to 2 1/2 years in the cellar. Pretty nice!"
"Pours a deep red with a fizzy lingering head. Nose hints of cloves and some candy sugar. Hit on the tongue is all about the malt. Approptiately thick without being syrupy, a big plus for my tastes. Starts sweet, the candy sugar takes over, and finishes sweeter. A decadently sweet brown ale."
"Notes from: 7/12/04"
"This quite a great seasonal offering, I'll differently look for this on tap at places. I could probably drink this all day, would have to watch out for its high ABV like noted previously."
"750ml bottle courtesy of Secret Santa 2005 and a former BA who I can't recall. Thanks."
"D: A good beer, just the residual sugars get to be too much, I'd rather have a 330 mL bottle next time. That said, I finished the 750 relatively quickly and enjoyed it."
"Although it may not be a repeat performer (one was enough for me), this is a nice change of pace for the holidays and I'd be willing to give it another spin next Christmas."
"Notes: This one is worth its weight in gold. Complex, flavorful, pleasurable, and overall, a very good beer. It didn't blow my socks off, but I definitely enjoyed this a lot."
"very perfect dark beer. kinda sweet but not too much. very nice. i would recommend this beer. its a real pleasure. bought locally so its not too hard to track down and find. perhaps the seasonal side to this beer may make it hard to find later in the year."
"Not bad drinkability, I certainly enjoyed my pour of the this."
"8/4/9/4/16 (4.1/5)"
"Overall this was okay - not offensive or too sweet."
"D - Exceedingly drinkable. Delicious."
"I loved this beer and found it to be an enjoyable experience."
"Drinkability: A tasty wintertime offering from Corsendonk and one I'd be happy (yes, happy) to return to next year."
"Drinkability: Not sure what separates this from other BSD styles, but I do get a bit more spice I suppose. Still, a delicious sipper, and one I feel lucky to have on this Christmas day."
"Really good beer, and very Christmas-y. I'll get more."
"Pours medium brown and translucent with white head. Nose is reminiscent of holiday spices, including some brown sugar and cinammon, maybe ginger. Also bready yeasty Belgian notes are there. Palate is on the medium to light side in flavors, with a significant mineral component and light brown bread with spices. Easy drinking, and rather refreshing as well. One of the lighter Christmas ales on the shelf to be savored at the holidays."
"The taste of this beer is of orange, orange peel and orange Tang with yeast sizzle and noticeable hops in the finish. It also leaves a touch of cocoa around the outer back of the tongue and has a very clean finish. The mouthfeel was average and the drinkability was good."
"D: One of the most drinkable christmas beers I have had this year. Recommended (especially on-tap)."
"D- very good, I would not have guessed at the slighty higher than normal abv very nice"
"D: Smooth and bubbly. Great flavor and mouthfeel make this easy to drink."
"poured from a bottle into a pint glass. Pours a clear brown color with lot's pop to it. A nice light brown heading that settles to an off white-cream type color. I couldn't quite put my finger on the smell until I read up on it and it did smell of molasses. I taste alot of different fruit's maybe some bannana some Christmas spices. Hardly any lacing. Carbonation is very heavy but very enjoyable. I would drink this again but it is ridiculously priced at $18.00 for 4 beers."
"The beer poured a clear, deep amber with very little head into a chalice. Didn't really detect anything in the aroma. The flavor was of sweet candy sugar and bubble gum in the foreground, with a nice hop bite and slight yeast sourness in the finish. Nice carbonation too. Seemed to be very well balanced, with no individual component dominating, which you would expect from a true Belgian strong. Much better than the Legacy Euphoria I had a few days ago."
"7/4/7/3/16/3.7"
"Big beige head, brown/reddish colour. Aroma is yeasty, malty, caramel, straw, hops. Although not very strong flavour is warming with noticable ABV, sugar, malt, dark fruit and some bitterness at the end. This beer reminds me of Chimay bleue, spices. Mouthfeel is lively with small bubbles. This beer was a nice aquaintance."
"D- I liked this alot! I thought it was pretty complex and a good sipper on a cold night. I could easily polish off the 4- pack on a cold night! I would definatly drink this again when in the mood. Cheers!"
"Comes out of the tap a translucent mahogany with a thick, fine-bubbled head. The rich, malty aroma has an undertone of cloves and caramel. Flavor is malty and spicy with a caramel undertone and hints of Coca-Cola and fruit. Texture is smooth, and finish is slightly sweet and pleasing."
"Notes: It was a real treat to find it on tap but really, for the most part it tasted like a really good Brown Ale (nothing much screamed ""Christmas"" to me)."
"D. This is probably my favorite Christmas beer. I think last years was better, but that was after some aging. Nice stuff."
"Excellent brew, I ran out and bought more."
"M + D: A little shimmer of carbonation that holds on through the mouth... it complements the medium body nicely, and the warm alcohol gives a nice smooth finish. Good stuff, and one of my favourite Christmas offerings to date."
"This is a well balanced beer that has all the typical Belgian characteristics, with a little bit of Christmas spice mixed in."
"This beer pours a murky amber-brown color. The head is a firm, light tan inch of foam which recedes slowly leaving nice lacing. The aroma is of ginger, anise, brown sugar, and licorice, with undertones of bready malt. The taste has everything from the aroma, with a nice soft roundness. The mouthfeel is medium-full bodied with small, lively carbonation, and a silky texture. Overall, this is a very nice dark Belgian ale. I will certainly drink this again."
"Taste is good and fillng. Lots of belgian spices, chocolate (not the darkest kind) and some typical notes of yeast and hops. I think this is a great Christmas beer! A real treat, for the low price, and only around 20 SEK or 3 USD."
"D- I would like to try this fresh, but I feel that as it sits at 2 years of age is quite tasty. Perfect for any winter evening."
"Overall this is a solid Christmas beer that should be in everyone's rotation."
"D = I think this is a definite pleasing drink for a cold Winter's eve, great seasonal. It does become somewhat cloying a little too soon though."
"D: A higher ABV makes this more of a really slow sipping beer. A must drink for the holidays!"
"Very carbonated mouthfeel and a well drinking beer make this a Christmas delight. Not quite as good as I expected, but very good none the less."
"D - Hugely drinkable but it would be a bit rich as an after dinner drink. I recommend it before the meal or on its own. Very nice stuff."
"Drinkability : an average beer in the style Belgian strong dark ale. I prefer Agus or Pater."
"Drinkability: This was a decent brew, though I can't say I was blown away by it. The spices and fruits were, though balanced, a little medicinal tasting. I didn't not enjoy this one, but it probably won't become my Belgian winter go-to."
"drinkability: this is a lovely winter warmer"
"This beer poured into my glass with a lot of foamy head and formed a beautiful lace as it dissipated. It has a body full of haze and carbonation. Its coloring is a moderate brown with a reddish hue. There is a strong fruity and malt aroma with just a little spice to the nose. It has a lot of citrus esters and malt to the flavor. There is some hop bitterness but not much. It has very smooth mouthfeel with virtually no signs of it high alcohol content."
"D: A 750mL of this amongst friends by the fire is the perfect holiday treat."
"D: It was smooth, rich, and complex. It is a bit heavy and has too high an ABV to be a long session beer...but as a holiday treat it holds up well."
"I preferred the fresher batch to the older one but they had very little difference, just more sugary in the newer bottle, not the best Christmas ale I have had but still not bad, definitely with a Belgian twist, not a bad price for what it is, especially surprised that a four year old bottle cost so little at a bar, might drink again, recommended"
"Christmas Ale is full-bodied and creamy, with notes of nuttiness, sweetbread yeast, and citrus that give way to spicy malts and dark molasses. Finishes smooth, with a slight hint of booze and raisin bread. The body is perfectly carbonated and flows well across the palate. All in all, a solid brew that I'd be happy to have again."
"Drinkability- Pretty nice, I'll have to try a fresher one if I find it again."
"So very drinkable - extremely enjoyable!"
"D: Drinkable, but a 750ml is a bit much for one."
"D- Very drinkable. I especially enjoyed the taste, very interesting and like no other belgian I have had."
"Most of the Christmas or holiday ales I've had in the past, including ones I've enjoyed, don't leave me wanting another due to the spices. This isn't the case with this beer because the spices are very well controlled and balanced. I would recommend this beer to anyone who hasn't enjoyed this type of beer in the past."
"Bottle: Poured a clear deep brown color ale with a nice huge foamy head with good retention and some nice lacing. Aroma of bubblegum and sweet malt is really enjoyable and somewhat reminiscent of great Belgian dark ale. Taste is a mix between some bubblegum notes with a nice fruity ester and some sweet Belgian-type malt. Body might be slightly thin for the style with some great carbonation and no apparent alcohol. I was expecting something good but definitely this one exceeded my expectation."
"Drinkability for a strong winter is surprising. Goes down easy for a liquid fruitcake. Must be the perfect hop balance and carbonation. May be the great holiday standard."
"D - Very interesting and makes you want more. A good bottle to split. Could be very nice at Holiday time."
"Pours a clear but fairly dark brown with a sizeable creme head. The nose is a lot of spices with dough and yeast and just a good overall funk. Hoooh! Hello spices! I'm getting figs and lots of fruit. This is almost like drinking a fruit cake. Nice and spicy and fruity. Feel has a lot of carbonation, but it doesn't really interfere with anything here. Very nice to drink. A good winter treat."
"I had this beer for the first time this holiday season, well actually a little after. It was probably the best winter ale that I have had all season. The pour was a dark brown with a one finger tan head. Fruits, spices, candied sugars, and chocolate were all aromas that this beer gave off. It tasted of chocolate, malts, candied sugars, and it was followed with smoky after notes. It was a well balanced beer with flavors that danced on my palate. Full bodied and easy to drink. Great beer to enjoy!"
"Pours a clear dark tea color with mahogany hues and a loose light tan head the fades quickly to surface. Visibly effervescent, tiny pools form to keep the surface happy. The smell is nice. Not terribly aggressive. Primarily earthy Belgian yeast over a mild and semi-sweet malt fig character. The level of carbonation gives the mouth a nice creamy texture. It complements the earthy malt flavors nicely. There is also a spicy note in the taste. Finishes on the dry side. An easy drinker, the 8.5% ABV is well integrated. Overall a lighter bodied product than I anticipated. The folks at Sam the Beer Man come'n through once again. Good call. had fun with this one. The cork restraint device on top was pretty unique too; a big band of metal across the top instead of a logo cap."
"The nose is impressive--lots of fruit and spice, especially ginger, cinnamon, and anise. The taste is enough to make one rave--fruit, and dried fruit at that, with raisin combining with more pleasant citrus; spice; all smoothly delivered. Well carbonated and smooth, this is a great BSDA and Christmas Ale, really outstanding."
"Pours a clear ruby red, some brown hints, very thick off white head forms, leaves tons of lace sheets, settles to a thick layer, very pretty. Smell is apples, spices, caramel, yeast, bread, nice malt layers, spices are done right, nice fruitiness. Taste is yeasty, some spices, bread, caramel, apples, banana, wheat, citrus, oak, lots of fruit, neat! Mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium to high carbonation, easy to drink, nice flavours, great Christmas beer. Thanks Jan!"
"Corsendonk's Abbey Pale Ale and Abbey Brown Ale are certainly two of some of the most flavorful, enjoyable Beglain beers... looked high and low to find the brewery's Christmas Ale, and finally struck gold at Oak Tree in South Plainfield where I copped a 750 ML bottle in a gift-pack which housed the bottle in a tin can stuffed with straw... Bought caged and corked, with the cork displaying an individual number of 6880... Teriffic dark, pruned-color hue with immense frothy head... smell is dominated by figs and malts, with a wonderful honey aroma... taste is complete with prunes, caramel, dark, brown sugars, thick and heavy malts, cream, candies, and figs... incredibly thick, rich, and intricate flavor dominated by a wonderful combination of sweet, candy flavors that dominate the pallate and overwhelm the taste buds with dark-fruit and toasty brown sugar flavors... excellent stuff, with an incredible thick, creamy mouthfeel... this one really takes over, and was worth the search... great drinkability, this one leaves you wanting more, and the ABV is barely noticeable behind a complex combination of amazing flavors... Another winner from Corsendonk... Definitely recommended..."
"Eric"
"This is a quality Christmas beer no matter which way you slice things. The aroma is outstanding and immediately pulls you into all the flavors of the holiday season. Thanks again Dana!"
"I'm not a huge anise/black licorice type of person so this one isn't going to be a personal favorite. That aside, everything else comes together to make a very enjoyable brew. Great for Christmas and that's probably often enough for me."
"Wow. I really enjoyed this one. The beer poured with a slight white head that remained throughout. There was a very slight alcohol taste but it was masked by hints of citrus. There was a perfect amount of carboniation that allowed for the complex flavors to come through. I will certainly buy another one if I can find it again."
"Thick and creamy mouthfeel. Carbonation is wonderful. This was a pleasant surprise for me. Didnt know what to expect but I am glad I picked this up. Didnt really taste any holiday flavors, but this was certainly a well made beer. Drinkability is about as high as it gets for an 8.5%abv beer."
"·	Drinkability: Perfect beer for a 750ml. A bomber of one of these is excellent after a delightful meal. One of the best Ive had recently."
"Morey's Bottom Line: I'm guessing that this beer was an inspiration for the Troegs brothers when creating The Mad Elf....that's how similar the taste is (see for yourself)."
"I love how complex, yet easy drinking this beer is, very solid Christmas ale."
"Plenty of body and highly drinkable. I wish I had another bottle for tonight."
"D: It was a good beer for celebrating a cold Buffalo night"
"Drinks fairly easy for the abv, a bit too complex for me to stay on all night. Interesting, but not really in my wheel house, I like'em maltier. Did get better as it warmed. Completely different than any other Christmas beer I've had this year, or any other year. One to age & then I bet it really shines"
"D: I thought that the spices worked well with the flavors of the beer but were still to strong for even another. Something that I would get once a week, perhaps, while available."
"M/D: Medium to medium-full body, pretty high on the carbonation, but it balances well. This one is incredible drinkable. I popped open my first bottle of the year with a friend a couple days before Christmas, and have since made it my Christmas beer of choice, drinking it on the eve and the day of, and now the day after. This is the best Christmas ale I have had this year."
"Pours a clean deep amber color with a light tan head. In the aroma, sweet cinnamon and hints of corriander. In the taste, dry cinnamon and hints of other Christmassy spices that blend together. A small spicey bite in the mouthfeel, and a dry cinnamon in the aftertaste. Hides the alcohol and mellow enough for newbies, but alway a very tasty beer."
"Overall- This is a nice Christmas offering. It is smooth and sweet, but just enough bitterness and bite to keep you interested and not overwhelm you with richness."
"Overall experience: A Christmas beer to pick up annually !"
"Corsendonk Christmas Ale 2007 vintage. It's very fizzy out of the bottle - I had to re-pour the first glass because of all the foam. It's one of the more enjoyable and distinctive seasonal I have tried. The Ale is a dark rose color with a vigorous head. There is a resemblance to rose champagne due to the carbonation and fruity tastes of grapes and plums. Cinnamon and other spices and gentle hops compliment the fruit. Very enjoyable during a dinner with friends - think I will return and buy more."
"Drinkabilty: This really is what a Christmas Ale should be. Spicy and orangey, with an alcohol kick. This one might actually do better with a few years on it, to turn it into a syrupy sipper. So far, the best Christmas ale I've had this season, and I've had quite a few."
"Crisp rather than creamy mouthfeel. This is one delicious Christmas beer. The spicing and heavy orange is different and very appropriate for the holidays."
"This has a complex aroma and is a tasty one to sip on in the wintery Christmas season!"
"Quite a winter warmer. Tasty."
"This is a wonderful dark Belgian ale. The beer pours a pretty thick, frothy, light brown head that retains for awhile, and just cuts an enticing image. The smell is plums, maybe a tinge of apricot, some yeast, and some sweet malts. This Christmas ale is quite full bodied, quite dark, bottle fermented, plenty of yeasty carbonation, with lots of warming alcohol notes. This is a delightful beer for a cold winters day. I'm looking out my window at more than 2 feet of accumulated snow in my New England backyard a few days before Christmas, and this beer fits the cliche in all the right ways. The taste is Belgian in that you'll get plenty of syrupy, candied sugar fermentation, sweet malts, yeasty carbonation and fizz, deep and rich fruitiness along the plum, apricot, prune family. The mouthfeel is thick, sweet, syrupy, warming, and wonderful. The aftertaste is fairly modest for a beer with 8.5% ABV. You won't get that throaty burn, but you will come back for more. L'Chaim."
"Opaque dark brown beer with a big frothy that subsides but remains throught the drink. The smell is lightly molassesy and not much else. The taste is a progression of malty, kind of creamy, and tart. Some ""Xmas spice"" is detectable (cloves, cinnamon, etc.), mostly cloves, but subdued compared to the malty, creamy, brown sugar dryness. This beer has a creamy, smooth, but sharply carbonated medium body. Its drinkable but the maltyness has some cloyingness to it. It stll tasted really good to me though. Good beer."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- A bit explosive in the initial burst, it eases up shortly thereafter but doesn't ever flatter the beer. With the yeast addition, the sharp aftertaste quiets and the texture eases. This tasting went a full two hours, but unfortunately it will forgotten beneath many more memorable Belgian ales."
"poured out a very lovely dark-ruby-brown color. Very foamy head, long rentention. smells of christmas! malts,fruits, plums,pineapple aromas on the end. Tastes as good as it smells, rich fruit flavors coming through. The mouthfeel is very satisfying,coats the mouth with a nice long finish. Highly enjoyable brew that I will look foward to every season."
"drinkability is good. well balanced. a nice christmas ale - good balance of fruit and light spice to keep it interesting, but not unpleasant or overpowering. if only they all showed this kind of balanced restraint!"
"Lovely, heavenly beer! A masterpiece. Pours with a nice fine head that lasts for a while but eventually mostly dissapears. Plenty of lace. Nice dark brown with strong red highlights. Spicey fruity malty nose. Good carbonation. Warming. Excellent mouth witth an extended finish."
"very good drinkability due to it's great flavor and aroma, and masking of it's abv. a great strong dark that was actually quite a surprise. one of my new favorite winter seasonals."
"This is a tasty treat. Complex, but very smooth and approachable."
"Exceptionally drinkable. Exceptionally flavorful. I will definitely have more of these before the winter is up."
"Maybe I got a bad bottle or something, I don't know. I just didn't care for this."
"Excellent and highly recommended.... especially if you can get it on draft."
"Overall, it's a little bitter for a winter beer but a decent brew that I could enjoy once or twice a year for the holidays."
"I'd recommend this."
"D-This is a great Christmas/Winter Warmer.It is a smooth sweet beer that is very drinkable and the 8.50% is very well hidden.I might keep remaing bottles until next winter!"
"Poured into a Delirium tulip a nice dark mahongy color, nice carbonation, nice two-finger foamy tan head, lots and lots of nice sticky lacing follows. The nose is malty, yeasty, nice touch of figs, raisins, and plums, also some caramel notes. The taste is slightly sweet, malty, nice dark fruits/caramel. The alcohol is hidden very well. Medium body. Very drinkable, this is my first Corsendonk and it's very tasty, I do have another brew by them, I'm sure it will be awesome as well. Recommended."
"If you can find this on tap, order it."
"Overall, pretty nice, although its tough to find a good bottle of it. I'd buy it again, and its well worth picking up, especially if you like licorice."
"Pours a clear amber brown color with a dense khaki color head that dissipated into a nice cap. The smell is of dark cherries and prunes, Belgian yeast, and some festive spices. The taste is of a subtle cherry or raspberry syrup, funky Belgian yeast, cinnamon and/or nutmeg spice and a nice bready malt to offset the sweetness. A very fine crafted brew. The feel is well bodied and fizzy, though not as carbonated as the other Corsendonk brews. Perhaps the finest of the Corsendonk brews. Nicely balanced with well hidden alcohol. Nice and complex. I notched the drinkability down a level due to the alcohol."
"750 ml into tulip glass. A: Amber/brown, light puffy head, nice amount of lacing. S: Toasted malt, dark fruit, caramel, spice. T: Sweet up front, raisins, caramel, pine, some citrus, grassy hops in the finish. Really great balance. M: Moderate carbonation, very smooth. D: Very drinkable. I can detect the alcohol, but it's pretty light for something this strong. Really wonderful beer, I'll probably pick it up again."
"Next to the Rochefort Trappist 8 and 10 this is the best belgian dark ale that i have had! pours a dark mahogany with a nice tan 2 finger head! smell is of dark bread,apricots,raisens and figs,taste is the same with low carbonation and a smooth malty finish,wow what a great beer! cant wait till next christmas!"
"A very flavorful brew and surprisingly easy to drink despite the alcohol, which hides in the background."
"This beer poured a nice dark copper color with a thick off white head which disappeared quickly. The smell was malty sweetness with hints of fruits and alcohol. The taste was of dark fruits and figs. The mouthfeel is heavy with minimal carbonation. Overall drinkablity is good. I liked this one. Nice beer to drink during the holidays. I'm glad I picked up the 8 pack with the glass."
"Matted but smooth mouthfeel with low to medium carbonation. Very mellow and silky. This beer would certainly lend itself well to a slice of pumpkin pie or any other sweet, custard-like dessert. Certainly a great selection this holiday season."
"Full bodied, mellow, smooth, very little effervescence, lightly warming. Very good indeed."
"12 ounce bottle with a best before end date of 9/18/2008. Served in a snifter, the beer pours a brown/ruby color with a half inch off-white head. It smells like citrus, spices, dark fruit, bread, bananas and pears. It tastes very fruity, like dark fruit, pears and bananas, and also like pepper, cloves and Belgian yeast. Mouthfeel is medium/full, but a bit over-carbonated to me. Drinkability is OK, it's smooth but the high carbonation cuts down on the drinkability. Overall I think this is a decent beer, but I think it would be better if the carbonation was lower. But even then, I'd still drink it again given the chance."
"Drinkability: Extremely drinkable, especially for an 8.5% alcohol beer. I've got two more that have been sitting since xmas '05. I'm not sure how much longer I can wait to drink these."
"Pours an impressive clear ruby/brown color with a thick tan/brown head. Aroma is Belgian musty yeast, as expected, not much else. Thick, creamy malt backbone. Hints of chocolate, nutmeg, yeast, bread, lightly fermenting fruit (pears). Yummy. Yeasty, dry aftertaste. Flavors linger. Usually the flavor follows the aroma, but not this one. Much more complex than the aroma indicates. Im loving this beer, even though its about 85F here in May, a far cry from Christmas."
"D: Very sweet and complex. A nice Christmas offering that does'nt go overboard with the holiday spices. Recommended."
"D - A pleasant holiday beer, not overpowering, but substantial and nicely balanced with just enough spice and sweetness complimenting the yeasty aromas."
"Well balanced and classy all around"
"Poured from the bottle into a short goblet. There is not much head except for a ring. Very active carbonation though the middle of the glass. The brew is a dark brown with reddish edges. The smell is awesome. Slightly bready with notes of dark fruit, sticky sweet brown sugar, nuts, and raisins. The taste is full, rich, and round. It starts out with a sweet caramel taste then it opens up into a floral, nutty flavor. The raisin and fruit tastes bloom throughout leaving a complex mix of flavor with every sip. As it warms the flavors become much more flowing and rich. The mouthfeel is great, no alcohol bit at all, just incredibly smooth and chewy. I never knew how great this stuff was, I bought the bottle I have now on sale from Christmas. Maybe I should buy a 3 liter next year and share it."
"Quite a delicious Christmas brew indeed. Alcohol is well hidden and each sip leaves me craving more and more."
"12oz bottle poured into a tulip glass. Pours a dark plum brown that produces large creamy light tan head. The aroma is light and bready with a slight amount of tartness. It is also a tad floral with some spice and citrus (mainly oranges). The taste is also bready with a good amount of malt flavor followed by a slightly spicy and tart middle that is finished by a pleasant bitterness and slight warming from the alcohol. This beer is very drinkable despite it's hight ABV. Overall, this is a very good Christmas beer from Belgium that is recommended. I will have to revisit this again next year."
"Mouthfeel-You don't se that much carbonation, bout you can feel it. Balanced and easy to drink, especially for 8.5% abv."
"Drinkability: Even though it reminded me nothing of Christmas, I might have to try this beer again next Christmas season. If it tastes this good in late January, then it might taste even better in early December. I doubt it, but it's fun to think that. As you can tell, I enjoyed this beer very much and I wished that Jolly Olde St. Nick himself came down the chimney and magically turned this little dinky 8.5 fl oz. bottle to a big 750ml bottle. I still can't get over how they grow oranges on pine trees during the winter season in Belgium."
"D: Certainly one we'll have again. Good smells & flavors, a well-crafted ale evocative of the Christmas season and our time spent in Belgium."
"This is a big, dark-brown beer with an light-tan head. The liquid is shadowy, with faint reddish-hues when held to the light. The aroma is predominately geared toward sweet malt, assisted with a lot of competing sensations: yeast, cherries, cinnamon, bubble-gum esters, nutmeg, and a handful of other spices. The taste is sweet and characteristically Belgian. Full malt flavor with some alcohol and an abundance of fruit flavors. Theres very slight warming, and it hides its alcohol surprisingly well. Fairly high carbonation and quite full bodied. This is a complex and enjoyable winter ale. Id seek it out again."
"As far as Christmas ales go, this is a definite winner and I will certainly return to it next year. Spicy and dry, but without the overbearing heat/warming feel of the spices of a lot of other winter brews (affligen noel, which i enjoy heartily, comes to mind). I don't think I could enjoy more than a bottle of this, but it's definitely suited to being a wonderful starter beer for a winter session."
"Pours a deep mahogany, with a fluffy tan head that evenly dissipates to thin lacing. I smell hints of chocolate, cinnamon & cloves, vanilla, raisins, and belgian yeasts. Taste is dark breads, caramels, christmas spices,and a tinge of hops bitterness, leaving a satisfying dryness. A very palatable mouthfeel, and very drinkable. This is perhaps the best representation of a beligan christmas i've had. Delicioius!"
"It is rich, full-bodied, dark beer which produces a lively head at first pour. It is malty and enhanced with flavors of candied cherries, almonds, cinnamon, spices. All the flavors mellow together nicely without being too sweet. It is very smooth, not a lot of carbonation, and the high alcohol content is not really noticable.. A delightful beer which I look forward to each Christmas."
"Overall - An excellent beer - pretty much how i expect Belgian Christmas beers to be... recommended..."
"D- It's a kind of weird beer. I think their other two are a lot better. Can't see me drinking the whole bottle of this. Just some weird aromas and flavors come out of this."
"This beer poured a dark brick red color with a thick head. The lacing is about average. This is a pretty beer in general. The smell is fantastic. A blend of spices (nutmeg) and various fruits (almost like a fruit salad). The taste is malty with a sweet/spice finish. The mouthfeel is delicate and carbonated. This is a wonderful seasonal beer which Id look forward to drinking during the holiday season!"
"Overall - Fun to try, but a little dissapointing. Reminds me a little of Lefthand's ""Goosinator", but with a little more depth."
"Poured a cloudy brown color, with a nice head that stayed around for the whole glass. Laced up the entire glass! Smell was nicely spiced, nutmeg, cinnamon. Taste followed suit. Almost had a spiced rum taste to it. No hint of alcohol, and very full feeling. Again very spiced taste about it, which cuts down on the drinkability of it a bit. All said, family enjoyed it, got a couple calls of""its different"". But this was a nice holiday feeling brew."
"A fantastic a well-crafted Christmas Ale for sure. Masterfully crafted and balanced with the right amount of heft to fill and warm the belly with enough grace to be set alongside the finest holiday dinners. I'm content drinking mine right here at the computer in the same room with my son kicking his Nerf soccer ball against the wall over and over and over again, (and I'm not annoyed in the least). A wonderful Christmas offering."
"Many thanks to numenor1 for the SS 06 package that included this."
"Appearance is deep brown with dark red hues, with a lovely off white head and some lacing. Smells of fruits, spices, and caramel. Tastes of cherries, cinnamon, nutmeg, other spices, sugar, and some smokiness. Very smooth and creamy, yet also a bit chewy. An excellent Christmas brew, looking forward to having another one next year."
"This is one of the best Christmas ales out there."
"On tap, this ale was quite good. Spices including cinnamon and cloves were very distinct yet not overwhelming. Extremely drinkable, although the 8.5% will surely catch up with you, I would absolutely revisit this excellent offering from Corsendonk. Cheers!"
"A decent holiday offering but not my favorite."
"Overall this is an excellent beer. I'm quite fond of the style and Corsendonk keeps my faith alive."
"D - Very nice winter Belgian ale. I would certainly like to sit around and drink a couple of these on a winter evening. Overall, a drinkable, complex, delicious Belgian ale. A great offering from Corsendonk, probably my favorite of their offerings. Stock up in the winter months while you can."
"D: This beer reminds me a lot of the Delerium Noel but sort of like the less alcohol cousin. Good drinkability and not too sweet."
"Served on draft in a regular Corsendonk cervoise, it was a dark amber in a color with very little head or carbonation, but left behind a nice khaki lace. The aroma was mainly sweet malt and yeast, but fairly mild. The taste was immediately dominated by anise, which gave way to a nice malt backbone and a bit of fig or prune, then a slightly boozy finish. I had trouble getting by the anise, which I'll admit is far from my favorite spice, and not normally so overbearing as to turn me off from the rest of the brew. The mouthfeel was a bit thin for the style, and since I didn't care for the spice used, I didn't find this one to be that drinkable. I should also note that the 8.5% ABV was no less evident then some of the +10% Noels that are much more balanced. I seem to recall liking the Corsendonk Noel last year, so I'm not sure if the recipe has changed, the keg I drank from needed aged, or my palate is finer tuned, but this year it's my least favorite of any holiday beer so far."
"Overall, this is a fine brew to sip with your family at Christmas dinner or while typing a review for beer advocate, whatever the case may be."
"Overall, highly recommended!"
"Cheers!"
"Drinkability: Well-balanced, no character dominates over the others."
"Pours an elegant red with a nice head and lacing. The aroma has a metallic hint, with hints of orange zest and spice. Mouthfeel was smooth, but the finish is a little weak, with hints of spice lingering. Nicely complex taste, sweet, toasted malt- caramel. Overall it's a mild but complex beer. Quite drinkable."
"Drinkability: Decently drinkable, but taste complexity may turn off some."
"This is a damn good beer. All kinds of fruit going on in here, plums, figs, oranges, bananas, nice oft sweet taste. Nice head with good lacing also. Should be brewed year round, as I didn't see the coralation with winter, not all that spicey. But nonetheless, a great beer that should be drank anytime it is found."
"I feel like I haven't given this beer enough credit, maybe because I can't taste everything going on there. Marked as a beer to revisit in the future."
"Pours a very inviting stained mahogany color, with a head of yellow cream. Clear but dark. Smells of wintery spices, sweet vanilla, and sugared plums. On the palate, brisk carbonation, followed by sugared date sweetness perfectly balanced by hops and spices. The fruit character is big and juicy, but plays well with the other elements. Mouthfeel is thick but not sludgy, with great winter consistency -- meaning it sticks to the ribs but isn't a chore to get down. Light carbonation helps out here, too, as it takes some of the load off tongue when the malt bill hits. Overall, this is a wonderful beer, far superior to the other standard Corsendonk offerings in my opinion. Perfect for winter time, but an excellent Belgian any time of the year."
"D: Nice cold evening beer. Not really something so unique that I'd go out of my way to get it again, but I'm glad I tried it, and it didn't disappoint."
"Picked this up last week in Eugene, OR at the Beir Stein. Best buy date says 06/19/06, oh well hehe. Poured a brilliant ruby red with a 1cm head that never went away into my Chimay chalice. Smell is of candied dark fruits, plums, faint hints of dark cherries, and some smell I cant identify. Taste is good, took awhile for me to pin it down, but I am getting a huge bubblegum taste in this. Kinda odd I think, never had a beer have this taste in it, not offensive, just interesting. Mouthfeel is a bit thin, and its the bubblegum flavor that does this, as soon as that flavor hits my sensors the beer gets all light and fluffylike in taste. I tend to prefer a thicker belgian beer so this was kinda a putoff for me. Drinkability is good, its a solid belgian dark ale, dunno as I would get more when I can get beers I know I like for the style easier and cheaper. But its always fun to try new things."
"I like this and plan to buy it again ... but only to see if the taste has melded a bit."
"12oz. bottle. A dark mahogany color with red highlights. Appeared to be clear. Light tan, large head. Smell was fantastic, raisins, port mine, molasses, caramel, dark chocolate, and some earthy/barnyard Belgian yeast. Taste was where it fell down a bit. Strong metallic notes, improving to raisins, dark fruits and chocolate. Some phenolic notes through middle. It all worked pretty well together. No hops to speak of. Medium bodied, low carbonation, drying with some alcohol warming. Overall, this beer has a lot going for it, but...many people have commented on metal in Belgians, but this is the most noticeable it has ever been for me. ABV well hidden, which made this relatively easy to drink. A pretty good beer, but not that exciting to me."
"Drinkability: Bad bottle? I doubt it, it's most likely been refrigerated since being put on the shelf. I will pass on this, hopefully othr bottles are better."
"As Christmas goes, there's no shortage of fine seasonal beers, and I will add this one to my list of preferred potables. It's righ, warm, and savory, and the end result is something to be enjoyed when the weather is nipping at your...well, something. The ABV will keep you toasty, and it is easily and wisely heeded, but it does go down in a fine way. So even though it's July, I'm anticipating the fresh release of this Noel nicety."
"D - Not bad, but there are certainly other dark Belgians I would look towards first. Decent drinkability."
"A creamy mouthfeel is balanced almost immediately by a tingly carbonation. The beer is not nearly as sweet tasting as the aroma would suggest, which is good as I was not sure if I was up fro a sticky brew. Notes of concentrated malt are here though. I get notes of dark caramelized fruit, notes of burnt raisins and roasted plums. Light notes of toasted malt join a hint of roasted grain. The fruit notes are what really stand out here; this brew is rich and satiating, yet actually not heavy and even a bit light and easy to drink, though I would characterize this as being light on the palate. Some spicy cola like notes are also in this beer as well as some light notes of clove. Actually the cola like note is definitely interesting, it is mostly the caramel flavors from cola, but definitely some of the spiciness is in this beer as well. This beer is quite interesting, perhaps a touch on the simplistic side, but quite good none the less."
"Pours deep chestnut with amber highlights. Pale tan head immediately fills the glass-then settles to one finger of dense soap bubbles, retains a cap very well and leaves spotty lacing. Complex phenolic nose with dark toasted malt in the background. Dark fruit aromas like dates and plums- and light fruits like peaches. The taste is sweet toasted dark malt upfront then turns tart and phenolic through the middle. The aftertaste hints at dryness, cleansing some of the mild residual fruit sweetness and faint phenolic bite. No perceivable hops here, but this balances fine without. Low carbonation and med/full body create a velvety texture, and the tart phenol/fruitness fades with the residual sugar for a satisfying but not overpowering finish. Drinks very well for the style...everything a Belgian strong dark ale should be."
"D - Awful! Awful! Awful! I never want this again. Each sip implanted a strong suggestion to send this brew to the drain. It was not too long before I gave in to this urge. It was terrible to do, but I couldn't drink another sip of this."
"A very nice flavored Belgian Brown Ale. The alcohol presence is well masked with the sweet and tart fruit qualities. Worth a taste; very warming for the winter months."
"BB 22-08-07. Nice apearance with beige head that lasts very well and a mahony dark brown almost black beer and clear. Nose is koreander, sweet caramellic malts, citrussy and litle sweet corn. Taste is good as it shows nice and full body, sweet but not overdone, litle spice and moderate bitterness. All together very harmonicly and balanced. Easy accesable and enjoyable christmasbrew."
"D - I am not a fan of sour tasting beer. Some people like it. I think I would not drink this again, not because it is bad but because there are so many that are better."
"Quite similar in Conrsendonk's Brown Ale, which is esquisit, but with a better musky aroma and flavor. Also has added spices that blend with the light tartness. The color is a solid brown with a ruby tint and floating spices and yeast; otherwise fairly clear with a stubborn foamstand. Smells malty, tart, spicy, woodsy, and lightly sour--typical of Belgians. Atypical in the use of nutmeg, allspice, cinnemon, and lightly pepperred. Viscous, round body with light wine, cider fruitiness and acidic. Finishes sweet, tart, and spicy with a light dryness. Delicate and bold--a joy to drink."
"Mours a ruby brown, sticky sticky lacing, and good head and retention. Aroma is raisiny, and slightly phenolic. Taste is refreshing, slight flavor of wood and a light mouth puckering, phenols are present and funky. Mouthfeel is okay, slightly dry though. Drinkablilty is ok, nothing great."
"D - It's an o.k. holiday beer. Not my favorite, but is good enough to bring in the x-mas cheer."
"D- This is a very nice winter beer. The fruit and spice flavors really give more depth to the malt without overpowering the flavors of the typical Dark Ale. Winter was made for beers like these."
"Pours cloudy brown with plenty of yeasty goodness floating about. Smelled like a super-strong ale, which is exactly what it is supposed to smell like. Didn't notice any other discerning smells to make this winter seem more special than others; although it could be considered that this isn't a seasonal (other than the label) because the expiration date on this bottle was 2 years from now. The taste was pleasureable, and although the alc content is high, it really didn't come off that way to me. All in all, a very good example of the style, certainly worth picking up a few more. Almost wish I could get it in the big-big bottle size the other Corsendonks come in."
"D: Warming and pleasurable. Very drinkable on a cold day or any other time for this matter. This beer is not limited to the Christmas season by any means. Quite complex in interesting."
"cheers..."
"d: something definatly something to sip on a cold winter evening."
"Pours a dark brown with a very large, light tan, frothy, slowly diminishing head. It has a pleasant, lightly sweet smell of perfumey wheat and Belgian yeast. Orange, clove, cherry and licorice. The taste is of big, sweet, complex malts with a moderate amount of citrus. The finish is long and warming, with all sorts of flavors still bouncing all over the place. Clove, nuts, prunes, bread even gingerbread cookie! The mouthfeel is nice but a little on the thin side for a BSDA. This is a very complex beer that changed so many times just over the 45 minutes it took me to sip this bottle down. Its a very intriguing beer that I cant wait to have again. A must try."
"Pours to a deep, dark brown with a tan head that leaves excellent lacing when sipped down. The aroma is of sweet candi sugar, malts, dark fruits and spice. The flavor is yeasty, malty and slightly sweet and spicy. Medium-full in body and smooth drinking for its strength. Nice brew. No thanks to StuBob, bob, bob, bob, bobaran for drinking half this bottle."
"This dark ale pours an incredibly dark color (as one would hope for). The head is foamy and plentiful, although not long lasting (a gentle swirl of the chalice will remedy this). The smell is a pleasant mixture of spices, fruits and malts. The taste is nicely balanced mixture of alchohol, citrus, spice, and malts, with no single feature being overbearing. A very enjoyable beverage. Worth celebrating the season with. Enjoy!"
"I went to the liquor store a few days later and bought the last 5 bottles they had. We really loved this ale !"
"This Belgian Strong Dark Ale pours a really dark amber color with a light head of carbonation. The smell to me was a light, sharp, and fruity. The taste was a sharp fermented beginning with hints of gingerbread and fruitcake (a good fruitcake)..yea I said good and fruitcake in one sentence! For a dark Belgian ale it has a light mouth feel."
"This was a very disappointing discovery after having this on tap."
"A fantastic christmas brew that is very enjoyable on a cold winter night. Heading out tomorrow to pick up some more!"
"Overall: A very good winter brew, happy I bought an eight pack."
"The beer is a nice thick dark brown color with a nice lacey white head. The smell is of holiday spices (nutmeg, brown sugar) and nutty. The roasted nutty flavor of this beer is really enjoyable and easy to drink. The mouthful that you get and the aftertaste are definitely a pleasure. I would have had a few more if I didn't have a few other Christmas beers on the list to try."
" Overall, another strong Christmas present from Meaghan and quality stuff from a big name Belgian brewer."
"Not quite what I was expecting. This is a very good beer that, while not the Christmas beer I wanted, was a pleasant suprise."
"Darkly translucent pomegranate brown with a big Belgian head that leaves gobs of lace and never leaves, at most falling to an 1/8 inch. Nose is malty, mildly spicy with little candi or yeast coming through. I was expecting a little more ""Christmas"" in this one. Taste brings out more spices including mace and coriander. There are some hops toward the middle and finish. The mouthfeel is medium with a dry finish. This is an easy to quaff brew that I recommend. It is reasonably priced, $7.50 for a 750ml bottle."
"Not my favorite Christmas brew. It's pretty enough- ruby red with a pleasant looking white head. Goes down from there. Smell is so raisiny and sweet- like candied raisins, really. Taste is... the same. But more so. SO sweet, SO raisiny- it's overpowering. I feel cavitites growing. Mouthfeel is on the watery/thin side, not digging it. Overall... meh... not bad... great for a sweet tooth craving, otherwise, pass."
"A very tasty Christmas cheer beer.Go get some."
"Pours a fairly deep brown with a creamy 2 finger head good longevity and very god lace. Wheat malt is predominate in the aroma mixed with brown sugar and spicy fruit aromas. Slight wheat malt mixed with huge amounts of brown sugar taste. Slight roasted bitterness. Spicy and slightly fruity. Could use some aging as it is a bit harsh still. Side note - I have had 4 of these in the last week and some of them had much more of a wheat malt flavor then others. Creamy. Good brew to savor by the fire this time of year."
"What this lacks in overall depth of taste or complexity, it makes up in drinkability. Like a supercharged Corsendonk abbey ale."
"12 ounce bottle. Corsendonk Christmas Ale pours out a dark amber color with a brown head. Aroma of ginger, pineapple, raisins, and plums. Caramel and bready malt flavor with lots of spice. A little chocolate. Some tropical fruit flavors come in at the middle. Delicious Belgian yeast. Alcohol is noticable, but I wouldn't have guessed 8.5%. Medium mouthfeel. Decent drinkability. A nice Christmas time beer."
"Quite easy to drink. I finished my glass with great ease and enjoyment. A fine Belgian dark ale."
"This was a dark brown beer with a small tan/white head. Moderate lacing and little retention. The aroma was malty and fruity with hints of raisin and alcohol. The taste was quite spicy, almost like gingerbread. Anise and very little hoppiness. Good warming feeling as the alcohol was apparent but not the best seasonal I've had recently. Not bad, but not excellent."
"Body falls just below medium with a soft creamy texture and light carbonation."
"Overall, a nice Christmas offering from Corsendonk, very affordable too, good bang for your buck."
"Drinkability: This is an ok beer; however, there are better beers to choose."
"Drinkability: 4.5, For such a heavy and strong beer, it is eminently smooth and drinkable, and the delicate blend of chocolate, spice, and fruit is very compelling. A wonderful and reasonably priced seasonal brew that I would welcome drinking again."
"Drinkability: This is one lovely Holiday ale"
"Slick mouthfeel, refreshing and substantial, but I was definitely ready to move on to something else after this one. Just not a session beer for me."
"I would compare this with Gouden Carolous Cuve Van Der Kaiser(sp?) in terms of taste, mouth and overall satisfaction. Well worth the $11.99. I will buy more."
"Incredibly smooth for such a strong beer, I absolutely loved the mouthfeel as it was incredibly smooth for such a rich and high alcohol brew."
"Perhaps too much of a good thing. This is a lot like eating a dessert that's too rich and too large a portion to enjoy. I can take this in small batches."
"750 ml corked ""champagne"" style bottle, packed in metal gift box. Now available in Norway (Vinmonopolet). Very dark reddish brown colour, slightly hazy. Moderate tan head. Very nice aroma of Christmas spices, oak, raisins, old sherry, toffee and treacle. Flavour is very malty sweet, plenty of caramel and some spices, hints of smoke, tart/bitter finish. Fizzy mouthfeel - due to the aggressive carbonation and tart finish this beer was not a ""silky smooth"" experience for me. I actually preferred du Bocqs Regal Christmas to this one (havent tried them side by side, though). R.C. is also somewhat less expensive."
"D: Could drink this all year, too bad its just winter."
"Overall: A top notch belgian, The age most likely turned everything down a notch, but the flovors are very well in balance."
"will try a 750 this xmas and rereview."
"poured a deep copper color with dark reddish highlights, very attractive head. Smell is of dark fruit (plums, figs) with a light spicy note. Taste is enormous with malt with dark fruits coming through. Finished fruity on tbh palate. A little bit of Christmas in August."
"taste was huge peppery spice, not liking that, with warmth from the alcohol its very carbonated and fizzy almost soda like."
"A dessert in a bottle."
"Poured into a Rapscallion snifter, formed an inch tall foamy tan head. Beer was translucent, but not clear, and of a bright reddish brown hue. Heavy foam lacing prevalent. Aroma is Belgian spicing and malts, with a bit of room left for some fruitiness. Taste is initially sweet malt, quickly enhanced by the spicing, then closing with a dry, slightly warming finish. Mouthfeel is quite creamy, and this brew is quite drinkable for its potency. Happy holidays would brought on by a few of these."
"Beautiful deep chestnut amber color with a sticky cream head that left lacing all over the chalice. Intensly sticky and clinging to anything it touched. I am not getting a lot of aroma off this. A small amount of phenolic fruitiness. The taste is crisp and spicy with heavy pepper kicks left on the tongue. The mouthfeel is very dry and a little cloying. This is a decent dark beligan, but not a memorable one."
"Spiced bread and green leafy vegetables are mingled in with a yeasty nose. Good thick bodied mouthfeel.. The taste is a nice big malty caramel, spice, anise and red apples.. it bitters quickly at the end.. the finish is on abrupt side. this ale would be perfectly matched with winter holiday meals."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a good strong carbonation...flows over the palate nicely. I really enjoy the flavor profile here and I easily see myself drinking a 750 of this. I'll be on the look out next year. Thanks to Cornboy for the opportunity."
"I feel like a committed adultery."
"Drinkability and Overall: This is a good beer, but doesn't live up to it's expectations. That doesn't take away from the fact that it's a solid brew, and an enjoyable one at that. It just seems to me there are much better beers of this style out there."
"Excited to try this one after a recommendation from a coworker. Poured with a nice 1/2-in. head in a Konings Hoeven chalice. A very pretty ruby color, that keeps me staring. I wasn't getting many aromas, only a fruit I can't pinpoint. Tasting grapefruit and cherries, and after warming a bit I tasted banana, also, a little but of alcohol lingers but not very noticeable. A nice tingling mouthfeel I rather enjoyed."
"The smell, taste, and mouthfeel are all very good. A dark mix of esters and malts dominate the overall flavor, with fruits coming through strong in the taste. The mouthfeel took me by surprise. It's very pleasing without being too sharp or too heavy at all. Drinkability is also very good, being both easy to drink and enticing."
"Drinkability: Price and availability are the only impediments to drinkability. I can only dream about how good this one will be after some time in the cellar. Highly recommended."
"Mouthfeel is nice and smooth. A rare treat to get a big beer that is so smooth and drinkable."
"Opened a 750 mL bottle on Christmas Eve of '04. Pours a dark shadowy garnet with a khaki head. Thick lacing down the side of the goblet. Aroma consists of spice, malt, licorice and cherry. Mouthfeel is full-bodied with plenty of carbonation. Rich malt is apparent followed by a noticeable anise or licorice spice. Turns a little minerally toward the back. Flavors of cloves and dark fruit emerge as the beer warms to room temperature. Alcohol is not noticeable in the flavor, but hits you after the first glass. The masked 8.5% abv can sneak up on you rather quickly. This was quite a treat on Christmas Eve."
"A dark brown hue and frothy white head (well maybe a bit off white) tops this beer. Spice is strong on the nose with dark fruit like plumbs and figs. A smooth and silky mouthfeel is present. The taste is malt and spice and a hint of alcohol wash across the pallet. This is a wonderful and easy drinking brew. After 2 or more the spice gets to be a bit much (well for me) Because of this beer, Xmas should come twice a year."
"A great winter-warmer...definitely one of my favorites."
"A winter warmer brown and spicey Belgium brew. Thanks Doug Shoemaker for an extra from your Esprit order. Easy drink, hard to believe its 8.5%. Foamy initial pour. Lots of malt and some sugar. yeastiness is there. Nicely hopped. Light medium mouthfeel."
"Teeny bottle, pours darkest of ambers, soft tan head, leaving some lacing. Pungent nose of bready rum raisin dough. this beer benefits from being served at a nice warmer temperature. Cold it had a prickly mouthfeel and some off putting flavors, as it warms it becomes much softer, and the tastes and flavors become rich. Lots of rum, raisin, cookies, mint, smoke, and alcohol flowing across the tongue. Very flavorful and pleasant stuff."
"Dark brown in color with a thin, spotty tan head. The aroma is slightly grapey at first, but darkens to a plummy fruitiness with hints of toasted malt. First flavor to hit the mouth is a candi sugar sweetness, followed by a vinous middle, and a toasty, pepper/corriander spicy finish. Light chocolate notes in the aftertaste. Fairly light bodied but hardly wimpy in terms of flavor. This is a well-balanced and nicely complex brew. Merry Christmas to me!"
"Mouthfeel was nice... not incredibly bold, but somewhat restrained. And I would definitely have more of these. I am not a huge fan of the style, as I prefer hoppier beers, but this one was a wonderful example."
"Leaves a nice warmth after every sip, a very nice brew, certainly a garanteed bottle on next years christmas table."
"Drinkability- THis one would be a pretty darn good one except for the metallic and stale issue. It wasn't super stale, but enough to throw off the taste buds and knock it down a notch."
"I'm drinking this to start off my night. If my night is half as good as this, I'm in for a real treat."
"I had this on tap at Monks. Very dark reddish-brown in color, with a little somewhat tan head. The head dies off rather quickly. The aroma is a hint os spices with a rich sweetness. Big, malty sweet flavor with a fair amount of spices, but not overdone. Some hints of fruits in the aftertaste. Just had the bottled version last night. Equally good!"
"I was surprised to find this at my local beer shop. Having never tried it before, the anticipation was almost better then the beer itself. Although the beer is wonderful; deep brown hue, with just enough spices in the armoa. A malty brew with a nice balance of citrus and winter spices. Not an overwhelming spicy beer, but one will so much flavor, that as it warms it becomes even better. Such a rich beer is prefect for this time of year."
"The one beer that I just absolutely love!!! A great brewery that produces the Monk Brown Abbey Ale has stepped it up a notch with this seasonal offering. This dark beer is not renowned for its hops(which are on the light side) but for its maltiness. It is a thick and rich beer with flavors and spices pouring out. You don't really have to think hard about this one but rather just sit back and sip that 750Ml of magic malt. this should be the favorite seasonal offering of any Guiness drinker. Once again. Wow"
"Just had this off tap earlier last week. We'll see how this compares. The beer pours a nice deep ruby color with a 3 finger head that finally falls to coat the beer. There is more spiceyness than I recall from the tap version. The orange peel is still there, but more subdued. The flavor is nice. Some banana sweetness with nice spiceyness overlayed ontop of this. I like it. The feel is thick and creamy. Drinkability is fairly good on this as well. Just a well assembled beer all around."
"Absolutely outstanding and highly recommended"
"Overall, delicious. I have one more bottle in the basement that is from last year. I think I will purchase a couple more to cellar as well."
"Overall, I am not a big fan of Christmas ales- usually a little too ""wintery"" for sunny southern California, I guess. Also, some are pretty out there in terms of spicing. This brew has those elements, but more subtly than others I've had. This is a nice presentation from a brewery I like all their products. Corsendonk was really my first experience with Belgian beer a couple years ago, and therefore, it's a favorite in my household!"
"The beer pours Garnet red-brown with a little head that doesn't last too long and leaves a little lace. It has a smell of caramelly malt and spicey fruits along with spices. It is very up front with the alcoholic taste of fruit citrus lined with spices of other warmers. It seems a little thin but not too noticable as the complexity of the drink is what I seem focused on. It is very drinkable and at this price I will have a few more."
"When poured, the color was a dark brown with a reddish hue. There was very little foam but, nice lace. The smell was the weakest link to this fine dunkel. I could pick up the malts and a hint of spice and citrus. The flavor was of a mild sour spritzy orange taste, with a hint of roasted malts and spice. A well balanced dunkel, maybe just a bit to sour in the after taste. But, still well crafted!"
"Rich, flavorful, spicy and filling."
"Quite the quaffable ale."
"Was able to try this brew on tap the tonight at Mahars. The brew poured to a very clear deep red/brown color with a nice off white head that broke down slowly and left great lacing. The aromas are fantastic with citrus fruit, malt, spices and candy. This is a great brew with the citrus, malt and slight chocolate tastes coming together and being enhanced by the spiced flavors. Also a slight alcohol flavor can be caught at the end of a pull. Over all this is a fantastic brew, glad I was able to give it a try and now a staple for the Christmas season."
"This must be an extraordinary after dinner-beer!"
"Very soft and creamy mouthfeel, with just a hint of herbal hop bitterness that lingered, this was a smooth, and rich tasting beer that is worth savoring each year. Outstanding beer, and very drinkable, even at 8.5% ABV."
"The beer pours an amber color with a thick frothy offwhite head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is awesome. It has a very sweet and slightly tart malt scent. It is quite complex; full of fruitiness and a molasses aroma. The taste is great as well. It has a very smooth malty flavor that goes down easy and finishes fruity and warm. This is an exceptional brew. It has great mouthfeel. It is a full bodied with adequate carbonation. This is a kick ass beer. It is full of flavor and aroma; a good drinker. This is one of the best Belgian beers I've ever sampled."
"The beer poured a reddish tan with an off white, and large-bubbled head. The aroma is sweet with notes of grape and maple. The flavor has notes of white grape, caramel, nutmeg, clove, anise, bitter root, and a light heather aftertaste. There is an undue harshness to the flavor and it could certainly use some age. It is also very carbonated, almost too much."
"This is a bottle of the 2003 vintage and today is Oct 4,2004. Dark brown in color with hints of amber when the light hits it just right. Has a small beige head. The aroma hints at herbs and spices but is has predominate dried fruit plummy presence. There is a distinct chocolate taste at first. Followed by a plummy fruitiness and a smooth herb and spice finish. As it warms there is an addition of chocolate to the aroma."
"Drinkability and overall: Great! Spices dominate and it is a pleasant drink. I'm always worried about drinking Belgian beers because I don't think my palate is worthy enough to pick up all the nuances of a finely crafted Belgian beer. I think this is the case for this beer. In other words, it's better than I can describe. Definitely worth your time to try and I will re-visit this one in December."
"This dark brown ale poured a large and retentive head that left pleasant lace upon my glass. The spicy aroma of cinnamon, ginger, and thyme was intriguing. Unfortunately, the flavor of the beer was not especially complex, and not entirely pleasant. Maybe this was a bad bottle but sour grapes flavors overpowered the chocolate and other malt notes. As the ale warmed, sweetness became a stronger presence but it never became interesting."
"Appearance proposes a huge off-white head over a dark brown body. Aroma is quite rich, very spicy with tons of cinnamon, cardomom, thyme, sage, ginger, nuts, caramel, tobacco, chocolate and a mild alcohol touch. Quite complex and appealing. It's another story on the palate though where we have another sad case of beer whose aroma doesn't match the aroma's promises. The flavors are just not so well blended together and the balance lacks where it's just some vaguely thrown spices to stop the sweetness. Not to help anything, it's very effervescent on the tongue, almost fizzy. Finish is malty sweet and a bit unclean."
"Deep amber, light brown hue, thin, yet bubble-bath like off-white head. Has a sweet, candy cane, malt-like aroma, perhaps some spices on the nose as well. Massive offerings up front, in this full-bodied masterpiece - some citrus, defining esters, sharp spices, coriander and plums are most noticeable. Tucked away are the decent winter spices, hops are quite noticeable, incredible malt-based backbone, ginger, cinammon, fresh grapes, even a burnt liked toast presence to her. The body maintains your a-typical Belgium yeasty/spicy offerings. For a winter brew, one of the best you'll find; superior in every fashion."
"Drinkability: High marks in this catagory as this beer has the ability to transport the taster to a place where the weather is cold, the nights are long, and brewers keep their customers warm and cozy."
"Update – I bought a bottle of this in 2008 and cellared it for three years. – opened in May 2011 and it still could stand another three years put away. It’s sugared up a little bit more but nothing like I thought. Fortunately this is a great ale all the way around. And again the real highlight for me is the incredible mouthfeel. The head also come up much nicer than I remember so I upped that score 0.50."
"poured a deep honey brown with almost ruddy garnet coloring...great thick white head with aroma of bready fruit and spice...great full bodied mouth feel starts off with that hoppy almost woody alcohol sugary taste with slight almost weird notes of toffee and then fruity plum figish notes with a finish of spice but not overpowering....this slow drinker will warm a soul up on a cold night"
"Probably the most interesting of the Corsendonk beers that I've tried. It's a bit overwhelming in the finish, becoming increasingly difficult to drink the more it warms. The saccharine bite, along with a light alcohol presence, becomes a bit too much for my tastes. Drinkable, but certainly a slow sipper. I prefer something not quite so sweet and sugary. Very good, just not quite to my tastes."
"Pours a two-fingered, thick, light tan head leaving an even lace. Color is a dark, clear amber. Light-medium carbonation. Light malty/hoppy nose. Medium bodied. Starts smooth and malty, finishes with a warming touch. Excellent Christmas ale. $7.50 for a 750ml bottle."
"Pours a deep brownish hue with a kinda white, kinda tan head. Nice maltiness, and some characteristic yeastiness, plus a little bit of biscuity kinda fruity flavor to it. A welcome surprise to find at my local farm market. And a bargain, at 4.39 for a 750ml I will be drinking these until they are gone. Overall a great holiday beer."
"Had this last night at the Spring House Drafting Room,pours a deep amber with some orange tint do it with a great creamy head.The aroma was awesome very orangy and nutty very perfumy on the nose.Taste is nutty with a touch of smokiness with some nice rich chocolaty tones.A nice full flavored beer I wanted to drink alot more,but was a little heavy after two,but still a real nice brew."
"This is the final Corsendonk that I have had. I must say it was a bit of a disappointment when comparing it to the other two Corsendonks. It poured an oakish color with a small, airy head and was very transparent. The smell was nice, brown sugar, yeasty, hoppy. But the taste was lacking the complexity I was expecting. Too thin in body and too strong in alcohol flavor. The spices were weak. The main malt flavor was toffee and hops were apparent throughout. The yeast and balance of this beer saved it and made it drinkable but I was a little disappointed."
"Medium to full feel, a little oily/syrupy."
"Dark amber color. Medium white foamy head. Aroma is spicy and malty. A medium bodied Belgian Ale. Malts are fruity, nutty and sweet. Very spicy and fruity. Cinnamon, cloves, plums and orange. Nicely balanced. Lively carbonation. Smooth taste. Hides the 8.5% alcohol very well. A nice Belgian belly warming ale. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and dry. Aftertaste is slightly bitter."
"My sample is at least a year old, probably older, as I purchased it last Christmas and hung it in my wine rack for the past year. My wine rack is the worse off now..."
"This brew was a murky brown colour with a lovely tan head of foam. The aromas were sweet, bready, malty and a bit spicy. The taste was spicy and fruity, with just a hint of booze. The mouthfeel was thick, but stil a bit watery for a Belgian Strong Dark Ale and the drinkability was absolutely great!"

"All in all, Corsendonk Christmas Ale is a very nice winter warmer of a BSDA and is one that I'll look for every year."
"I was wary at first because there was a definite spruce/pine smell. I didn't like the Anchor OSA because they went overboard in this area. The taste of the Corsendonk was pleasing, however, with a subtle malt flavor smoothing things over and the Christmas tree flavor being complimentary instead of dominant. I enjoyed this one, but I'm still trying to figure out why people want their beer to taste like a tree."
"750 corked and caged bottle opened wit a stiff wisp of carbonation. The beer poured a dark cocoa espresso color with a tall foamy head that reduced rather quickly leaving nice lacing on the glass. The smell was spicey, buttery, with layers of yeasty bannana aromas and freshly split oak logs. The taste was well balanced with traditional belgian ale flavors from the yeast bits in the glass. Each sip brought out the changes in this beer as it warmed from the early crisp dry notes of spice and tobacco to the later fruity plum, bannana and fig flavors. Each mouthful was enjoyable from the early cold & well carbonated one to the final warm & flatter one. A fine exmple of a beer!"
"Funny how there are so many varying descriptions of color with this ale. Mine poured an almost clear reddish amber that has a beautiful hue to it when you hold it before light. Head was creamy and dense thanks to the work of Belgian yeast strains. Very nice fruit aroma with a subtle spiceiness. Lively mouthfeel and a smooth medium body. Flavor is a fruity malt with a peppery cherry taste. A nice belgian ale that I would drink regularly if available."
"The taste is nice and round, with a spiciness and butteriness that reminds me of Affligem Noel. I'm noticing just a bit of tannins, but not enough to make a significant impression. It's not as big, round, smooth, and slick as the Affligem, but then again what is? So far this is my second favorite Christmas ale."
"I believe this is the 2002 version. An excellent beer! Pours a murky black cherry color with a very rich and creamy head of foam. The aroma emanates sweet raisins and melon. Almost like a fruit cordial, or Pucker liqueur. The taste is alcoholic, bitter, fruity and dry and sherry-like, with hints of chocolate and cherries, even has a hint of rum. The flavors are complex and its easy to find a lot of good things in this beer. Flavorful with a medium malt sweetness. Highly drinkable and an excellent Holiday beer. Now, if I could only get this one on tap."
"A dark copper to brown color with a low beige head that leaves sticky, chunky lace around the inside of the glass. Aroma is sugary and fruity. Flavor is sweet and yeasty, with noticeable notes of cinnamon and nutmeg and sweet fig. A smooth mouthfeel leads to a sweet and yeasty finish, with honey and pear and yeast lingering in the aftertaste."
"Jason mentioned Plum pudding and I have to agree. wouldn't have thought of that myself but when I read it, it definitely brought my gran's plum pudding."
"This beer poured a murky ruby orange with a good off-white head. Head fell consistently down to a thin film. Aroma was of lovely spices, malts and liquor. A very sweet smelling beer. Many layers to the taste of this beer with fruits,spices and nutty malts and a great warming effect compliments it well. A spiced candy is my best explanation for this taste.The sweetness became a bit overpowering on the aftertaste and I could probably handle only one. A must for the holidays though."
"I enjoyed this. I want another one."
"Opaque and very deep brown color, a mountain of bottle-conditioned head. Laces in simple blobs, however. Very pleasant chocolate covered strawberry aroma with a little zip of yeastiness. Highly carbonated, not usually something I like, but a nice match to the malt expression of fleshy pears and decided peach tones. Finishes with more astringency but with a pop of confectioner's sugar. In some ways, this reminds me of a Dubbel that finishes like a Duvel, a fine example of complexity and the brewing art. Very nice beer..."
"2003 version: lot no. 131484. Poured from a caged and corked 750 ml bottle, it pours a deep garnet with a foamy off-white head that leaves little bubbles on top of the beer after it fades a bit. Spicy smells are backed by subtle ripe fruit sweetness. Even a slight trace of mint is noticeable. The taste is equally complex and enoyable. The hops are just enough to give it a kick as the beer hits the back of the tongue. The creamy, effervescent body just enhances the experience. Wow, this and Affligem Noel in the same week. I'm in Belgian Christmas heavan."
"I tried this for the first time about a year ago and must have gotten it mixed up with another beer because this time it wasn't at all what I expected. It's a good seasonal but doesn't tickle my fancy the way so many other winters have. Oh well."
"A very nice beer indeed-Corsendonk Brown was one of the first Belgians I ever had.Pours a gorgeous deep ruby brown with a nice tan head atop.Aroma of spices-earthy and woody.Nice spicy taste-malty as well-theres a slight tartness in the finish.Good full moutfeel to it-I find the tartness a tad puckering but not in a bad way.The alchohol is well hidden I could see it sneaking up on you.A very decent example of a Belgian Dark-the neck label say ""Belgian Quality"" and I gotta go along with that."
"Time and time again this beer continues to wow, me I am for certain that this beer is one of the most palatable and drinkable of all the Christmas ales, it's amazing stuff. Appearance: Mahogany amber brown in color with a lucious cocoa colored tan head, lacing is fine Belgian style lacing all the way. Aroma: Ginger, spruce tips possibly of hop origin scent, peppery zest blended with more Christmas spice accented by juicy fruit undertones, wow. Taste: Apples, raisins, and some slightly alcohol infused flavor but all in all the spices used ginger, nutmeg mild but kicks through with pure balance bringing some beer nirvana my way. Mouthfeel: Creamy textured with a medium body overall high carbonation but doesn't come off spritzy still very smooth and silky going down. Drinkability: God don't get me started I could indulge in two 750ml bottles of this fine ale effortlessly just a great Belgian Xmas ale to be shared and enjoyed with friends."
"Deep ruby color with a frothy white head. Excellent lace appears down the chalice. Fruity, malty nose with hints of spice, notably coriander and curacao, and a definite yeast presence. Sweet, fruity, lightly toasted character ties in with the spiced notes, though a bit lacking overall. Vinous character seems most dominant with emphasis on raisin, prunes and residual sugar from the the malt. Mouthfeel lacks a bit, too, seeming a bit thin and watery, especially on the finish. Drinks fairly well, though the mouthfeel is not overly appealing. Even so, the beer masks its abv well, making this a decent wintertime sipping beer. I think this beer would be much better at about six months in the bottle with the yeast poured in the glass."
"Taste is warm, rich, and pleasing. Sweet malt, thick body, and finishing tartness from the yeast. Alcohol isn't as apparent in the taste. Makes for an easy drink, and can be drawn out over long periods of time. This 12 bottle took me 75 minutes."
"Mmm...another good holiday beer! A nice treat from a wonderful brewery that I already enjoy, and another beer I had the pleasure to split with my friend WVbeergeek."
"Lovely treat. Had this one out of a 3 liter with an expiration date dated March 2003 (2000 vintage). Poured a hazy plum color with tinges of red if held to the light. Nice tan head that lasted and left a good lace. So yeasty in the 3 liter that it was almost opaque. Smelled of orange peel, corainder, cardimum, and dark berries (blackberry). Touch of dulled pine somewhere in the mix. Tasted malty, slightly spicy and sweet. 3 liters tend to be a bit yeasty, and this one was no exception. There was a faint tartness in the finish. Highly effervescent in wickedly drinkable for a Christmas seasonal. Thanx to a co-worker for sharing."
"Dark, dull, cloudy brown body with a decent super-light tan foamy head. The aroma and flavor are brown sugar and very fruity, but the flavor is overall pretty mellow. The flavors are a little dull and this kidn of slides into the middle of the pack of my Belgian strong ale experience."
"This ale poured a dark brown color with hints of red. The foam was tan and settled relatively quickly. The smell was vinous, with the smell of alcohol. The taste was slightly sweet malt but with caramel, oak, fig, and vinous grapes in the mix. The mouthfeel was smooth and light on the tongue. The body was medium and the carbonation low. This was a good, enjoyable strong ale."
"'Tisn't really the season but this beer would hit the spot no matter what time of year. Pours a dark reddish-brown color with a medium thick creamy beige head. Very little lacing. Aroma is well-spiced. Nice rich texture, with flavors of caramel, malt, alcohol, spices (pepper) and a little fruit. The finish is warm and earthy and just a little bitter. Overall this is a well-balanced yet complex seasonal that I will look for over the holidays."
"This is a very good beer. It pours very dark and murky brown with a hint of red and a small head and little lacing on the glass. Much unlike the other Corsendonks that I've had in the past - better actually. The aroma was fairly spicy, but my terrible nose couldn't detect any of the scents very well (but they were there). The taste was very good. The alcohol was apparent, but barely and in a good way. There were some fruits and spices in the taste as well. I can't see gulping this beer, but as I drink it right now, the sips are heavenly. I recommend trying this beer. My rating of this beer also may be slightly skewed because I have been drinking it about an hour after having a Westvleteren abt 12 - the best beer - so my ratings may be slightly skewed."
"Oh yeah, Santa remembered I was good this year! On tap at my local. What a gorgeous brew in the hefty stemmed goblet. Lovely dark chocolate color. The aromas and flavors are very cohesive and continuous. Chocolate, raisin, plum, hints of cinnamon and nutmeg. Semi-sweet and roasted malt teeter back and forth. Alcohol is warming and welcome lending its own spice. The full mouthfeel is satisfying. This delicious beer is worth the wait until Christmas time."
" The flavor is loaded with spices and yeast. It has a warming effect from the alcohol, but the flavor of alcohol is well hidden for 8.5%. this is definitely a great brew for the winter season. A whole lot of spices and a high alc. level to keep you warm on those cold days."
"This beer poured a nice read color, with loads of head. The head is clumpy and creamy in color. Plum is the first smell to hit my nose. There is also hints of raisin and many others. The taste is not quite what I was hoping for. The plum is felt on the tongue as well as sweet candy, but other flavors are not there. There is almost no lace to speak of. It is moderately-bodied. For a 8.5% beer, there is almost no problems drinking a full bottle, but there is a alcohol warming. Highly drinkable. This beer should be aged for a while."
"A color that straddles eggplant and plum, underneath a lovely tan head. Intense aromatics: raisins, plums, port, cinnamon, ginger cloves. A generous buzz on the tongue fueled by a great array of hops,and held up by solid malt base. Overall, one gets a feel of holiday breads, cakes ginger cookies. Very tasty, warming, delicious."
"Christmas day, 2003. That's when i cracked open my first bottle of this Christmas Ale. Very dark amber in colour. I disolved the yeast sediment at the bottom of the bottle before emptying into my glass. If the rich appearance wasn't enough, the wonderful spiced nose and hints of dark chocolate certainly made me warm without even taking a sip. Very smooth and rich i found. Hints of plum and unsweetened dark chocolate. Although this beer was 8.5% alc, i found that there wasn't a noticeable alcohol finish, which was nice. Good beer. Nice winter warmer."
"A murky mahogany color on the pour, with a bountiful head that is also frothy in its texture with the residual lace fine sheets to coat the glass. Aroma of raisins, malt and cotton candy sweet, a true pleasure to the nose. Sweetly malt at the front, top is rich and full, and the finish brandy like, pleasantly hopped, pleasing in its acidity and the aftertaste somewhat alcohol bitter with a nice sense of warmth for the tummy on these cold winter nights."
"Dark reddish amber body with a thin lacy head. Pretty good head retention, especially since it was rather weak to begin with. Sweet malty aroma, lightly spicy. Smooth dark fuity flavor with a strong caramel malt base. Light taste of cinnamon and maybe nutmeg add just enough character to this brew. Spices are somewhat lighter in Corsendonk's offering than in many others, but it works well."
"An absolutely wonderful brew that I am glad I got to enjoy on tap. After the Kwak keg was tapped at Monk's, Tom put this sucked on and I am glad I was there for it. The Ale has all the traits you would expect from a standard dark strong ale (belgian candy sugar, nice maltiness, etc.) and adds a subtle spiciness that works incredibly well. The christmas spices do not feel ""forced"" like they do in a lot of winter seasonals, but seem to form a perfect complement to the base beer style. A true masterpiece IMO."
"Nevertheless, for 8+% brew, this is staggeringly drinkable....literally."
"First of all I must say, I sure prefer Belgian winter seasonals over most of the domestic ones I've sampled. I guess it's because I favor the style in general. Anyway, I really enjoyed this beer. It pours out a murky brown with slight red tinge. The tan head was ample and lasted for a bit before subsiding to a nearly non-existant layer. A whole lot going on here in the nose, big bready fruitcake aromas, molassas, chocolate, and alcohol. The flavor closely echos the aromas as many beers do. Very light carbonation contributes to a slick and appealing mouthfeel. Sweet malt, dark Belgian candy sugar, and fruity esters dominate the profile with hidden flavors lurking underneath the surface. Maybe a little maple and orange plus a bit of chocolate and plum. Each sip reveals something different. Alcohol definately plays a large role and its gut warming presence is quite detectable. No hops here to be found, though I suspect they were part of the recipe but have since faded away. Great winter brew. Goodbye my friend, on to this year's iteration."
"750 ml bottle, pours a hazy brown color, huge frothy tan head. fruity, bready aroma smells kind of like fruit cake, matly and sweet fruity-candy like butterscotch flavors, full body, creamy thick mouthfeel, a great holiday ale."
"Pours a cloudy brownish/amber...nose is very interesting...dark fruits combine with a pudding like smell....body is a little too thin in my opinion but is very drinkable, and smooth. A lovely milk chocolate flavor emerges first and is followed by dark fruits....sweet ripe plums are definitelyevident...some subtle spicing (ginger?)makes this even more tasty...I love this beer...a great Christmas beer but also just a great beer on its own...the Alcohol is not noticable on the taste but it warms you up...a great tummy warmer and my tummy is needed a lot of warming these days.."
"I thought this was a decent beer that was easy to drink, but compared to other Belgian style Christmas ales, I thought this was lacking in flavor. It poured beautifully with a one inch big bubbled head. The body was dark until held up to the light then was reddish and crystal clear. The most dominate flavor was metallic, with chocolate, maltiness, and spices very subdued. Alot like their pale ale but darker with a touch of chocolate flavor. A bit thin on mouthfeel with a high carbonation level made it easy to drink. I think I would rather have Delerium Noel or N'Ice Chouffe instead."
"Another (ho hum) outstanding beer from Belgium. First off, I love the look (maybe it's the mood I'm in). It's garnet in color, topped initially by a frothy tan head. The head reduces to a millimeter layer across the top, which is continually fed by these moderately-fast moving streams of bubbles. Not quite champagne-like, but close. Smell is cooked plums, raisins, with hints of ginger, coriander, and orange. Taste is a festive combination of bread pudding and cooked plums. Spices hit in the middle, with coriander and ginger hitting first, followed by a mellow clove aspect, finishing with a touch of caramelized orange rind. Mild hop presence keeps things nicely balanced. I agree with other reviewers that the mouthfeel is a bit thin (due in part to moderately high carbonation), but I'm actually enjoying it. I will add this to my list of holiday traditions!"
"Very tingly mouthfeel to start (settles a bit with time), with a round chocolate and date malt base. Very firm bitterness, tastes like it's mostly due to spice rather than hops. Curacao orange and spices (clove, coriander, ginger) start to round out the flavor along with a Belgian yeastiness through the sip. Finishes with a slightly bitter malt and spice flavor that's rather enjoyable. Very drinkable to start, but to me the spices would get old after a couple."
"Clear deep garnet in hue, topped by a beige, creamy, thick head that settles painfully slowly. Citrus rind, hints of spicy ginger, and slightly tart pear like fruity esters upfront in aroma are layered on top of a raisiny Special B malt undertone with notes of sweet milk chocolate. Light must and clove are present as well. Dark, date - like fruity sweetness hits the palate at first, then is ceded by a combination of curacao and hop bitterness. Spices are dominated by citrus, but a pleasant heat is provided by the mellow, seemingly freshly grated ginger root. Mild chocolate malt surfaces as the palate adjusts to the spices, adding to the overall complexity. Sweetness is derived from both dark caramel malt, slightly cidery dark candi sugar and residual unfermented sugar due to the low hop bitterness. Pleasantly sweet and spicy overall. A bit light in body and a touch too thin in mouthfeel to support the malt profile. Finishes with dryish notes of burnt toast and ginger. Corsendonk Xmas Ale is a delicious brew that exhibits a nice balance of caramel sweetness and spices. With a fuller body, this would be outstanding. Corsendonk Xmas ale is very tasty nonetheless, highly drinkable and a bit dangerous. Reminsecent of Anchor Our Special Ale kicked up a notch and fermented with a Belgian yeast."
"I have found Belgian ales to be a bit cleaner on tap than refermented in the bottle and it definitely adds to the drinkability of this brew."
"This beer is a deep clear ruby color. Just a swirl of a head. Color of brown. Recesses to an edging and a few peninsulas jutting out from the glass side. Lacing is intricate. Wood, cinamon and subtle pine notes make a presence on the nose. Body is about light-medium. Hard to believe this brew is 8.5 a/v. Not a trace of alcohol lingers on my tongue. Cinamon, ginger and nutmeg, oh my. Not sure if I've got all the spices correct, but there is definitely some nicely integrated spicing. Not as over the top as the Anchor ""Our Special Ale," which is good in it's own right. Some slight bitterness is noted from the hopping. Maltiness is so subtle and nice. Delicate pine and spruce notes blend in nicely as well. Incredibly drinkable and tasty brew. Beautiful."
"Notes: Similar flavours to an English Plum Pudding. Warms the soul during these long cold winter days. Very flavourful and lacks no complexity ... lively yet a brew to savour. Goes down in the books as one of the greatest winter brews ever ... fantastic!"
"This is a winter treat.  Lemony, citric aroma welcomes you to the first sip, and the citrus follows through in the flavor very nicely.  Interesting chocolate malt flavor that had a distinct tea-like character."
