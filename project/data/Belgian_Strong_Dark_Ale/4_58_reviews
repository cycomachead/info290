"Golden tinge and opaque. Earthy malt, slight farmhouse, roots. Slight anise finish. Another great one"

"This stuff is pretty light colored for a BSDA. Still a pretty beer to behold with a deep burnished gold and an dark off white head that leaves some nice lacing. In fairness I accidentally cracked this 32 oz bottle by accident as it was mislabeled by my vendor so it might have had a bit more carbonation and such had it remained at unopened and a bout an ounce or so fuller. Hardly flat it shows light carbonation as it sits and a leaves nice decoration as I drink. The nose is delicate and sophisticated. Lots going on. The peated malt is remarkable. A delicate smoke wrapped around sweet lightly breadiness. Hints of coriander honey and maybe a touch of citrus. Faint notes of bubblegum live in pods of anise. Taste is a great followup to the nose. Peaty malt abounds with a honey and spice cake center. Light fruits, apple and pear, maybe a touch of mellon. The anise shows itself a touch more and builds a great platform for the hops. herbal and spicy they nod back to the body of the brew while giving a clean dry finish. Notes of pepper linger along with cinnamon, graham and brown bread. Just a hint of alcohol but not enough to serve a warning. Feel is velvety with a light creaminess. Light enough to encourage sessioning with the aforementioned hidden alcohol. Just enough presence to lead you to sip and savor. This will compliment any food you find yourself near. From traditional winter to lighter fare with an artisnal flare. This is a beer that is sublime and superior. One of my new faves this year and so far my favorite from Allagash"

"O: Very nice beer. Not eating with food but is definitely something to enjoy with a good cheddar."

"Taste is where it shine. Nice belgian base with a citrus flavor up front with a smokey backbone and a nice pepper finish. the smokeyness really takes this up a notch. Its so easy to drink and perfect for this cool fall evening. Great brew...highly reccomend this unique take."

"Overall, quite good. Unusual for the style."

"I have been hanging onto this bottle for a while, so it is obviously lacking any hop presence whatsoever, but I found it to be rather enjoyable. I would definitely drink this again."

"O: This beer doesn't really taste like a Belgian Strong Dark Ale as it lacks the flavors of dark fruits and dark malts but it is a nice Belgian Ale."

"O: unusual for style, this Belgian ale was disappointing but should appeal more to folks who like wild yeast in their beers more than I do."

"The beer pours a hazy brownish-red color with a white head. The aroma has a ton of brown sugar and dark fruit, as well as some caramel and toffee. There is also a little spice and some alcohol. The flavor has a ton of toffee and caramel, as well as some cherries and grapes. There is a bit of pepper, as well as some alcohol and candy sugar. The carbonation is fairly light and the beer is soft on the palate. The age has definitely not hurt the beer, although I can't say if it improved it."
"Pours a murky honey orange with a foamy beige head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Foamy streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, brown sugar, spices, and yeast. Taste is much the same with a slight honey flavor as well. There is a mild spice bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer that has aged well in my opinion and is still quite tasty."

"750 ml bottle into chalice, batch 19(probably a few years old). Pours a hazy reddish orange color with a nice foamy 1 finger off white head with great retention that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Some spotty lacing on the glass, with nice carbonation streaming up. Aromas of big prune, golden raisin, pepper, coriander, clove, caramel, candi sugar, and spicy yeast. Nice and well balanced aromas with good strength. Taste of big caramel, prune, raisin, apple, pepper, molasses, biscuit, clove, roasted nut, candi sugar, and yeast spices. Lingering notes of caramel, dark fruit, molasses, biscuit, and yeast spices on the finish for a bit. Great balance of flavors with the spiciness. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a slightly creamy and slick mouthfeel. Drinks really smoothly despite the slightly prickly carbonation. Alcohol is nicely hidden with only a slight warming after the finish. Overall this is an excellent Quadrupel style offering from Allagash. Great balance of flavors with a high amount of complexity; and is super smooth to drink as well given the 7.2%."

"Pleasant fruit and spice aroma, which continues into the palate. Peach/apricot flavors mix with spices, producing a nice, light beverage (but still full on flavor!) that nicely complements the colder fall days. Hops are kept to a minimum, so the bitterness is subtle, and grain flavors tend more towards lightly-toasted Grape Nuts. Drink this one while staring at the New England foliage in October, when the leaves turn red and golden-brown."
"Pours a dulled copper color, cap of frothy off-white to khaki colored head, decent sticky lacing. Smell is quite sweet and bready, followed by notes of fruit - both dark like plum and faint citrus, holiday like spicing, a light musty eathyness is present. Taste dominated by the sweetness - carmel apple, plum and citrus, bready and lightly toasted malts, holiday like spicing more muted then the nose, slight notes of booze. Quite hefty for the style, muted carbonation, lingering sweetness. A nice, full flavored quad."
"O- Nothing spectacular. Expected a little more from a ""Grand Cru"""
"O: I'm so glad this is being made again. I used to drink it when I first got into craft beer. This is a welcome return."
"O: A solid beer from Allagash. Very low ABV for the style, but still feels bigger. Worth a shot."
"O: another solid offering from a great brewery. This is what I've come to expect from Allagash."
"Overall great, I think the bottles were better years ago but those are long gone, but a great beer"
"D: Glad to have tried this because Allagash stopped making it before I got into the beer scene. Certainly tasty, but I'm not sure what it's supposed to be. Try this before it disappears again"
"Allagash Grand Cru looks like your average beer, brownish shades with mahagony hues and tree bark edges. Just a whiff of tan/white suds on top creating a loose cap, no stick. Smell is berries up front and not fake berry either, a pleasant whiff of toasted malts with bread, some caramel, and than with warming a disgusting scent that reminds me of a basement. Taste is nice though and not so in your face and sugary like alot of quads, more should be made in this vain IMO. Berry forward, plum over apple, caramel sweetner, fruity over sugar, my type of quad. No alcohol interference. Feel is superior and medium making for at least two goblets to go down the hatch, I can't say that with any other quad. Carb ios minimal, smooth is the word with the slightest bit of heat towards the end. This is a winner except for that awful smell with much warmth."
"D - A nice sipper and something that's different and welcoming for a change."
"D: One is enough. Not a bad beer, but also not Allagash's best. There are better quads out there but this is a perfectly acceptable take on the style."
"Not a big belgium fan here but a different change from Chimay. Thanks Allagash for this winter brew and looking forward to springtime..."
"An enjoyable and simple quad. Not nearly as layered or complex as others in its style, but a very good beer."
"Overall this was one of Allagash's offerings that was slightly underwhelming to me, and it is still a fine beer. Not Allagash's best effort but a solid beer that's worth a shot."
"Smell is of yeast, sweet malt, spicy thyme or nutmeg. Taste of over ripe fruit, slight sourness with sweet flashes of pitted fruit, caramel, malt, passion fruit. There is a sweet yet cleansing peachy mouthfeel with nice balance and a pleasant aftertaste that lingers. Heck, I could drink several of these ... a very pleasant experience, too bad it looks like this beer is retired, it belongs in your refrigerator and mine!"
"Drink- I'll give it 3.5 because it's tasty. Not too bad but fresh probably would've been better and this didn't deserve and A."
"D: intriguing multi-dimensional flavors. The silky texture really improves drinkability. Sweetness not overbearing, but might seem cloying if not the first beer of the evening. Would try again, but not a favorite."
"D: A very good, complex, Belgian winter sipper. Aside from the spices noted in the nose and a bit supplementing the hop profile, I don't get why Grand Cru is a winter seasonal, as its dry, floral and honey qualities would endear it to the spring as well. At any rate, the 7.2% ABV Belgian dark ale is a nice brew to have on hand for the impending winter months, if you can still find some on closeout in your area."
"D- Very drinkable. There is a good balance between alcohol and (only 7.2 ABV) and the malty flavor. It goes down easily"
"Taste is surprisingly disappointing, the flavor just isn't there, at times it just seems downright watery, the carbonation is solid for the style, very slight banana taste, the rest is just candied sugar that is way too muted, the strength on the other hand is very well hidden."
"T - Again with candied fruit, brown sugar, hazelnut coffee up front compliments the nose well. Oakiness, dryness and grassy moss in the finish. Just a very well put together beer makes for an experience. Enjoyed with pickles, salami and salty crackers."
"D: This one's really too heavy for me. I had trouble finishing the bottle on my own. That's not to say I didn't enjoy it; on the contrary, I found it to have just the right complexity and a great mix of flavors that work well in hot or cold weather. Still, it's simply too rich to enjoy a large amount of."
"Overall impression: average drinkability, although too dry and sweet for me."
"Though it's a bit rough around the edges due to bottle-conditioning and spices, it's delicious, full of character and a nice change of scenery from the typical winter seasonal releases. For a cleaner experience, we recommend that you store this beer cool for several days, allowing things to settle, and decant slowly in order to leave as much of the sediment in the bottle as possible--if you want a spicier experience, decant the sediment."
"Overall, a good beer that is well worth picking up."
"Bland and not too interesting. Poured a dark chestnut with moderate head. Some sweetness to the malt, but no complexity to that aspect. Moderate bittering, but again fairly one dimensional. Not much going on with the yeast flavors. I would have pegged this as a basic, no frills winter warmer had I been blindfolded."
"While a great beer for any occasion, I think this will compliment a meal, without altering the dish. Because it blossoms with warmth, pour this with conversation, but perhaps it is best suited for a cold lazy afternoon."
"Very good. Complex...with great carbonation. Malty and fruity...like your typical grand cru's. Very sweet to start, finishes a little dryer with a mild bitterness. Very tasty beer overall and another great beer for the Allagash line-up!"
"EDIT: Looking through reviews after posting mine, I see that this is labeled as a quad. I'd disagree with that, myself. It's more of a Belgian Strong Ale. A touch too dark to be a pale though and a little light to be a dark. A hybrid, perhaps? Just doesn't seem anything like my definition of a quad though."
"Drinkability- very nice, Allagash did a really good job with this one."
"This is a drinkable beer, but watch out, that 7.2 percent ABV is very deceptive. Although this is labeled as a quad, it seems as though it's sort of a Belgian Strong Dark-Belgian Strong Pale Ale hybrid with spices."
"D: This is a very nice beer, which is no surprise coming from Maine's best brewery. A fantastic sipping beer."
"D: extremely drinkable... its very well balanced and finishes perfectly dry."
"Whoa...I just saw this is categorized as a Quad? Whats up with that? I find this much more Belgian Strong Pale Ale than Quad. In fact, I find this much more Belgian Strong Pale Ale than Belgian Strong Dark Ale...but thats just me."
"D: Very drinkable."
"overall a very nice strong belgian ale."
"Drinkability: I really love this stuff. Delicious spicy BSPA. Thank you Allagash."
"I just couldn't pass this beer up at Whole Foods in Dublin, Ohio, and I'm glad that it made it into my cart. A very interesting beer, full of character and enjoyment."
"poured into a snifter,this beer is a deep hazy amber with a nice persistent head.nose is yeast spiciness,medicinal phenols,and a bit of citrus.taste is yeasty spice,herbal phenols,a bit of bready sweet malt,fruity esters,with a dry and slightly warming alcoholic finish.carbonation is high with a slightly higher than medium bodied mouthfeel. overall a great beer.each sip invites the next."
"M/D - The mouthfeel is a bit rich. Right now I am in the mood for all of the malt but it doesn't fit the style well. I would liken this as closer to a barleywine but I think this will be a big winner or a big loser person to person"
"A very poor effort."
"Overall - I acquired this one in a trade, which is kind of a disappointment now, because I realize I can't find this gem anywhere near me, despite seeing Allagash beers around Queens regularly. If I had constant access to this one, It'd be hard to resist."
"drinkability is great. excellent balance. it's definitely changed compared to a fresh BSPA, but i think i like it better this way. the alcohol is less present, and the spicy and floral notes take more of a back seat. i think i might have to pick up some more of this to sample fresh, and a few others to stash away and forget about for a while."
"D- This beer starts off with mostly yeasty flavor and some malt flavors but as it warms the hops start to step up and balance out this beer more. It has some good complexity but the yeast and spice flavors taste just a bit off and flat. I don't think age would help much with this beer but I could be wrong if the yeast were still in the bottle."
"This is easily one of the best beers I've had in this style. Definitely on par with top-notch Belgians I've tried. Very smooth and drinkable. Not even a question that I would get this again in the future. Not much else to say here; I need to try more Allagash brews."
"One of the best offerings from Allagash. High in alcohol but hides it well with all the complex flavors. Highly recommended."
"750ml corked and caged. Poured into a chalice glass, it is light copper with a thin head that leaves a hint of lacing. Smells of sugar, bubblegum, and anise. Taste is peppery, phenolic, and a tad woody. Very balanced and very good! The mouthfeel is well-carbonated, very bubbly, and with a nice slickness to back it up. Perfect! Very, very drinkable. The alcohol hides itself and the sweet up front is balanced by the dry finish. Wow. I think I'm in love. Really this time, not like the time I got hammered and that ugly chick was on the stool next to me..."
"Allagash Grand Cru pours an orangeish color with a white head from a brown 750 ml corked and caged bottle. The aroma is fruity, orange being most prominent. The flavor is nicely fruity too, orange stands out the most as well, there is a bit of malt that is noticeable, but hops are virtually nowhere to be found. This is a very nice version of a Belgian ale. Definitely worth a try."
"A nice beer, but it falls down in the taste. Granted, it isn't bad, but it is such a let-down after the nice aromas. Certainly worth giving a try if you enjoy Belgian styled beers, but I don't think it merits being a regular."
"Notes: This is a damn fine example of the style from an American brewery. Every Allagash I've had has been quite good, and quite authentic. The malty deliciousness with great fruit flavors and spice really tickles my fancy. I loved this one! Highly recommended"
"Allagash makes excellent beer. They have an uncanny knack for doing a tremendous job with Belgian styles. Only a handful of American brewers have that ability. Grand Cru is all-around excellent beer. I'd like a little more thickness, but not much. I was really close to pulling the ""4.5"" trigger on feel. If you run across Grand Cru, pick it up. It's excellent."
"Recommended. I'd like to try it on tap."
"After looking at some of the other reviews, I'm wondering if I got a different brew in the bottle, this is a dark beer... Batch reads #20."
"This is, all around, a solid, good beer. The drinkability is no different, it is also good."
"From notes. Bottle into hotel juice glass after an evening at Ebenezer's. Deeper than golden, hazy, 1 finger whie head fades to ring, some lacing. SMELLS of corriander, anise, yeasty, bready. TASTE is like the nose, spicy, bready, yeasty, a bit hoppy. Smooth, with clean finish. FEELING includes some fiz, light/medium body, clean finish. OVERALL it is a smooth, clean, easy drinker."
"D= I didn't know what to expect of this beer other than I love other Allagash beers so it must be worth a try. Well, needless to say I was quite inpressed with the aroma and flavor and found this to be quite drinkable. I'll definitly be having more soon!"
"Finish is yeasty, a bit peppery, dry. Mouthfeel is medium-full bodied, with a light, spritzy carbonation. Really nice beer, though the odd metallic taste does drop a point or two."
"D - I would most definitely order another."
"All in all very drinkable beer don't think I'll have any problems finishing this bottle."
"All in all, a solid 4 across the board."
"Overall pretty taste"
"First impression: leaves a definite sour/slightly bitter aftertaste that I'm not too fond of. Not a sweet sour, or a tart sour, but kind of a vinegaric sour. (EDIT: as the beer warms, this flavor fades away. Turns into more of that floral feeling I describe later). The spicing makes up for it, though. Definitely has that Allagash taste to it, it doesn't really seem to have a breadiness to it, not much in the way of heartiness. A medium-bodied feel all the way through. More of a hop presence than I would expect, not bitter though, more of a pine presence. A little nutty there at the end, too. Also has a floral presence, someone else said jasmine, I have no idea what jasmine tastes like (except Princess Jasmine from Aladdin, mmm) but we'll go with that. A little thin in the middle where I think it should be warming. The spicing kicks in in the middle though, and carries it along on the palate. Tastes slick and soapy, the beer slides right off the palate, but the flavor remains. Some good (spices yay), some bad (vinegaric, boo). Very drinkable, goes down like candy (that's what she said!) Overall, everything is pretty balanced, as it gradually warms, all these different parts add to a complex, delicate, delicious harmony. Not a bad way to drink off the cold winter months. Not my favorite brew, nor my favorite Allagash brew (FOUR, so far!) but I'd probably seek this out again (might grab some more to last a while before Julio's is out!) and would definitely drink this again. Overall solid, good but not outstanding. That's good enough for me."
"This wasn't as 'Belgian' as I expected but it was every bit as good as I anticipated. I certainly wouldn't have minded more if only I had the bigger sized bottle, next time around I'll be sure to splurge for the caged 750ml. My only critique of the beer would be a name change, I know from tasting so myself that Allagash is capable of brewing better beers than this."
"Pours a hazy light gold in color. Very nice two inches of head on top of the beer. Smell is citrus fruits, yeast and a bit of spice. Taste is even more of the citrusy and light fruits. Very smooth and easy drinking. Well balanced and enjoyable."
"While maybe not my favorite in taste, this really is a joy to the other senses. A definite must pick-up that comes a relatively low price for the Allagash line."
"Worried my brew has hit an age barrier. Hasnt aged improved thats for sure."
"Medium bodied, creamy, but with a crisp carbonation. A dusty yeast feeling throughout. I must admit that this brew hit me harder than I anticipated, given the reasonable 7.2% ABV. Well hidden, but I have knock some off the drinkability due to that fact."
"Orange-gold pour with some haze and a big white head. Aroma of spice, clove, and yeast. Taste is corriander, clove, and sugar, with a lot of apricot. Good malt and yeast backbone. Great balance Very light mouthfeel, but compliments the variety of flavors."
"Spices a bit too forward, but I must admit that I'm not a huge fan of spiced Belgian-style beers."
"Another good Allagash brew"
"This is a great brew. I plan on drinking it more."
"Notes from 05/31/04."
"A light beer and one that is easy to drink, probably not the most ideal winter beer but an excellent beer none the less. I would recommend buying this then cellaring it until the spring time."
"The aroma has a tremendous amount of esters giving it a fruity character along with floral hops and brown sugar. The appearance is medium brown with haze. The flavor is sweet and fruity with some spice. The palate is a little thin for a Belgian but not bad. Overall I like it."
"D - Excellent. Something that should be enjoyed durng the winter months like the bottle indicates. Very impressed with this beer."
"An excellent beer from Allagash. Is great in the cold winter months but I could see it being refreshing during the summer as well. Highly reccomended."
" Pours a cloudy brownish/dark tannish color, light brown medium sized head. Small bubbles, quickly diminishing. Very floral aroma, spices of coriander, some mild malts, pretty strong aroma. Malty spicy taste, taste of flowers, same spice as aroma (coriander?) Aftertaste of some spices, but milder, not overpowering. Nice spiced beer. Even better as it warms up."
"This stuff is great. Its like a american belgian. I need more!"
"Drinkability: A party in a bottle... very drinkable and yet complex and one to savor. Bring a few when invited over..."
"Mouthfeel is very filling, even with a crisp carbonation. Slightly chewy. This a is a pleasant and relaxing beer to sip."
"Overall: I'm very thankful for the opportunity"
"D_A good decent brew with some depth to it but one that does not quite wow me in any way. While not as offensive as some American versions of Belgian brews it really doesn't make me want to have another when the real thing makes it over here."
"Overall a complex and authentic Belgian. Well done."
"Once again Allagash shows that they can knock swords with the Belgians, the fathers of these styles. This is a very tasty Belgian Strong, loaded with character, and an excellent approximation of the classic examples."
"A: Slightly opaque, orange tea, cottony foam lining the edge - 4.00, S: Subtly fruity and spicy, signs of orange, Belgian yeast - 3.75, T: Spicy all around, borderlines on not being a beer, what I presume is coriander, a soft marshmallowy sweetness - 4.00, M: Wet cotton, smooth - 3.75, D: Likely a crowd pleaser among the non-beer drinkers, quite Belgian - 4.00"
"Sampled out of a good old fashioned 12 fl oz. Poured a very deep, burnt orange color into my glass. Slightly hazy appearance. Beige head laced well throughout the whole sampling though the retention was a little lacking. Very pleasant and complex aromas of ripened fruits, allspice, orange peel and cloves. The taste was equally enjoyable, spices first, then caramel malts, more citrus and the a dry spicy finish. Nutmeg, cloves, allspice again. For a higher alcohol beer the percentage was well blended in (perhaps the aging, I sampled this winter brew in the middle of the summer). Very good in general and well worth picking up."
"What a nice change of pace, I am glad that I finally picked some of this up. Burnt orange in color, the beer is hazy in the glass. A moderate white head that swirled around like a distant galaxy leaving minimal lacing. I can actually see the beer sparkle in the glass when held to the light. The aroma is nice and mild with an earthy yeastiness. Scents of spices tickle the nose I detect the likes of nutmeg, cloves, and perhaps a touch of coriander. A smooth moderately complex flavor is present. I slowly sipped on a couple of these throughout my evening, real nice drink. A subtle presence of malts lend way to a calm spicy profile. Licorice is evident now along with the spices previously mentioned. Well behaved and not over the top in the least I really enjoy this flavor. Mouthfeel is a bit weak. I wouldn't call it thin but there is a lackluster feel to this one and the finish is somewhat odd, not unpleasant perhaps just not in line with the aroma and flavor. Overall a wonderful change of pace, I'm glad that the brewer didn't feel the need to over spice this one, well played."
"Drinkability: Very nice. This is a tasty, fruity brew with plenty of complexities and good balances. It's not ridiculously high in abv%, and what's there is hidden well, so pick it up if you see it."
"very enjoyable. like the southampton grand cru, this is more on the caramelized, malty and fruity side of the spectrum than a duvel, so one might want to keep that in mind and not have their expectations thrown off. (NOTE 11/2010 - when originally reviewed, this was categorized as a BSPA.)"
"Maybe I just don't like Allagash as much as some. The look like Belgians, they smell like Belgians, but I always feel they just miss the mark."
"Split a 750mL with allthetimeineed. Batch 16 (bottled 8/23/07) cellared for about 10 months. Poured a clear ruby color with a dense off-white head that settled to a cap which remained throughout. Moderate lacing. Smell of cloves, licorice and maple. Flavor is malty and deep, with the spiciness well blended. Hints of prunes with a sweet forefront and slightly less sweet finish. Somewhat heavy mouthfeel, but still surprisingly drinkable, even on a warm summer evening."
"($3.45, 12oz, Oliver's Bev., Albany, NY)"
"Anyways, saw reviews on batch #4 from 2002, so this beer is probably at least 6 years old. It has held up GREAT!!"
"Drinkability was way too easy. Based on the bottle saying it's ideal by a fire in the ""cooler seasons", I thought it would be too thick/heavy. Grab a Cru for summer, too!!!"
"D: Very good drinkability, and alcohol is pretty well hidden."
"Overall, a very nice brew. Nicely drinkable and enjoyable."
"This is a very nice beer and well worth seeking out. It pours a cloudy orangy amber color, with just a bit of foam around the rim. No real lacing with this one. It is surprisingly lighter than expected. I would have tagged this for a full bodied, sweet, syrupy, candied sugar Belgian, but not so really. It is more medium bodied, less spicy, with less the candied sugar heaviness. It does have the clove, coriander, rind, fruitiness that one would expect, and plenty of spices in the allspice family. It lacks the peppery snap at the end, tends to be a bit more musty, a little less of the yeasty mouthfeel, and just more summery than I imagined. The finish and aftertaste is a bit sourish spicy, not peppery. This is very drinkable, the ABV is hidden quite nicely, and there is no lingering throaty aftertaste that is too common for the style. The aroma is the weakest link in that it is too subdued, a little more husky than I would have imagined as well. This is a good beer, enjoyable, and not as wintery a beer as the marketing leads one to believe. Have this anytime. L'Chaim."
"Final Thought: Impressive beer from a brewery that has always known what their specialty is... and keeps me coming back to them."
"Wonderfully drinkable - Alcohol well-covered. I could drink this any time of the year and be happy!"
"This is a very nice and deceptively drinkable BSPA. I find myself downing the bottle quickly and not feeling the expected weight of a typical BSPA. Allagash did a fine job on this brew."
"D: The dry yet semi-sweet after taste makes you want to go back for another sip, but all the other characteristics of the beer make this one fall more towards a sipper for me. Especially when lining it up against other Belgian pales."
"Drinkability: Despite the complexity of this beer, the flavors just don't cut it for me; after a glass I was ready to move on"
"This is a full flavored ale that comes very close to the traditional Belgians."
"Overall- no idea what to expect when coming into this, but I'd glady drink this again. Very well balanced, soft yet distinct, the nutty/bready flavor really got me. A really good brew by allagash, along with white and interlude, definitely one of my favorites from them."
"Poured into a tulip a very nice darkish golden orange color, very nice carbonation, very nice two-finger creamy off-white head, lots and lots of nice sticky lacing follows. The nose is malty, yeasty, some nice spices thrown in, and a dash of caramel. The taste is mostly malts/yeasty, very nice touch of spices, and some caramel to top it off. Medium body, a very nice well-round/complex brew. Very drinkable, this one is a joy to drink, thank you Allagash."
"D: Pretty good. The finish is a bit bitter for my taste, it seems to give the beer a harsh flavor. Nothing particularly daring about it-has all the elements you expect from the style, but no real twists to make it interesting. A fine brew but doesn't even come close to some of the others I've had in this style."
"This was an enjoyable beer. I liked the mix of flavours and it had a slight twist (or so it seemed) on an otherwise traditional take on the style. Certainly worth a try and a nicely crafted brew."
"High carbonation, substantial body, wheaty smoothness. One of Allagash's best."
"I don't know. This beer didn't really wow me or turn me on today, but it was a nice beer nonetheless... but I've had better from Allagash."
"I would buy another one."
"This looked about the same as Victory's Grand Cru, but it had a fresher scent that had more hops in it. However, the taste was more bland. It was mostly cistrussy sweet with a bit of hops in the aftertaste. There was really no malt to the flavor, or any complexity at all. The texture was watery, with some soapiness to it. This was easier to drink than the Victory because it was so bland (not as sickeningly sweet), but it wasn't rewarding to drink at all."
"Poured into a Duvel glass and enjoyed its rich color, aromas of dates, bread, and spices; decent foamy head that settled after a few minutes but easily sprang back to life with a few swirls of the glass. Purchased at Whole Foods in the Fair Oaks, VA area. Go get one."
"Yet again, Allagash has thought this beer through and made a Belgian that you never would suspect was American. Very enjoyable."
"Orange with a big white head that laces the glass. A bit of sediment left over in glass make this a lightly hazy brew. Aroma is yeasty with a heavy citrus character and also some malty aspect there with a sweet backbone. Taste is slightly sweet, lightly citrus. Not much bitterness to speak of, a little at the tail end. A bit of grapefruit in there, but there is not as much spice or fruitiness to this brew as in other Belgians - it's sort of restrained. A solid brew, but I wish it stood out a little more."
"I am going to holistically review this beer, not section b section. It starts with a very sticky head that looks lovely. there is also an amazing aroma that i can not dissect. i hate myself for this but i know its good, herbal, and delicious, but i cant tell you what they all are. I do know that for this style its amazing in all regards. that may sound trite and useless, but trust me. if you like this style or similar pick out this beer and you wont be sad, or disappointed. It has a very fragrant aroma, a gorgeous appearance, and an amazingly balanced taste. try it. love it. know it"
"Notes - A solid brew, but not my favorite from Allagash."
"Very enjoyable Belgian Strong Ale. I think I will have this next go around."
"Side note-I really wish this website made the distinction between a Belgian Pale and a Belgian Amber Ale. This is definitely a Strong Amber-as opposed to a Strong Pale-and there is a big difference between the two."
"From a corked and caged 750 bottle, this poured a cloudy orange with a light orange head with big bubbles and major league lacing. Nose is of oranges and malts, with a hint of coriander. Mouthfeel is fizzy yet it is sticky on the back of the tongue. Flavor is sweet and of malts, oranges and apricots. Dry finish with some spices. A little hard to finish the glass."
"Drinkability- A very drinkable beer, an excellent introduction into the world of belgian ales."
"750ML Corked and caged, Batch #13. Pours a clear, pretty golden amber color with nice carbonation bubbles racing to the top. A nice soapy head that dissipated fairly quick leaving some nice soapy lacing on the glass. The smell is of Belgian yeast, and that damn creamy-funk corriander aroma, plus some orange peel. Sorry but a big corriander profile is the bane of my beer existance. The taste is of candi sugar sweetness, caramel malt, and spices with corriander being predominate. For a ""Grand Cru"" there is nothing that exciting about this brew. The feel is moderate with rather soft carbonation resulting in a silky feel. Nice balance between the malt and spices. The flavor doesn't blow me away. Not sure why ""Grand Cru's"" need to have corriander as their main flavor characteristic. The flavors do balance out well which makes for a very drinkable brew."
"I really only get a hint of the high-ish alcohol content, which is good. Goes down smooth, but for that little bit of bite."
"D:get this when you can, drink some now and then put some away for the first snow of next year, the aging will effect it nicely!"
"This was certainly good. but nothing for me to write home about."
"Drinkability was equally exceptional, as the alcohol perecentage really struggled to be noticed, and the refreshing and crisp taste had you wanting more and more - I could easily drink this one all night long... Excellent stuff... Definitely recommended..."
"On the whole, an excellent beer. Very complex taste and texture. I do love this style of beer, but this is still a brilliant example of it."
"Surprisingly drinkable, maybe not at the price though."
"A great beer from a great brewery"
"Pours a cloudy orange brown with basically no head. Nose is a yeasty citrus thing with a minor spiced tone. Flavor is a bit tangy with a nice spiced kick to it. Feel is just slightly thin on the liquid and the carbonation is lower, but a bit biting it seems. A nice spicy BSPA. I bet this would be good to pair with food."
"Pours lightly-hazed shimmering copper with a half-inch of tan head. Lots of medium-fast carbonation present and the cork nearly popped by itself. Very aromatic to the nose. Pear and pineapple smells blend with earthy yeast and pepper. A light hop presence is detectable as well. The flavor is even better. Initial grainy hop dryness leads to a ripe pear center that explodes with fruitiness. The fruit lingers into a sweet candy sugar and light alcohol finish. The body is medium-to-light, very clean and refreshing. A great blend of creaminess and carbonated zip. The beer seems awfully drinkable at first; becomes a bit heavier as you reach the second half of the bottle."
"Allagash Grand Cru pours hazy light copper with a thin but lasting head. The aroma is sweet and spicy with some sharp yeastiness. The flavor is sweet and malty upfront followed by bitterness with a slight astringent quality. The beer is nice and fruity with plenty of esters from the yeast. The spices are there but not dominant, maybe some corriander and orange peel or a bit of clove."
"Enjoyable belgian style pale with a nice dry touch to even out the balance. Forget the champagne, celebrate with Grand Cru."
"Creamy smooth mouthfeel pulls this beer together nicely. Dangerously drinkable. Wonderful use of candy sugars to round out the beer. While this beer may not scream winter despite its label it does say"
"This is another very nice brew from Allagash, a brewery that I don't return to often enough. I rather enjoy this in the cold weather as a fine winter seasonal classic, but could see myself turning to it in the spring or summer too if the timing was right. A fine beer, this Grand Cru."
"This was a special beer, but it wasn't a really special beer to me. It was okay, but had this odd note in the maltiness that just seemed off."
"Very creamy mouthfeel which was balanced by the higher carbonation. Extremely drinkable."
"odd."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, good kick, nice representation of style, due to its complexity, this is a nice beer to drink for a while. I'm not sure I could pound it for a whole evening, but I could certainly enjoy a 750ml if I'm in the right mood."
"D - Not a session. Not my favorite style, but a nice beer."
"The 750 ml bottle from batch 16 poured a cloudy ruby orange with a white billowy head. Aromas of Bananas and Belgium yeast along with a complement of spices filled my nose. This ale had a nice clean mouth feel with a dry finish. The flavors of this one was surely a surprise for a grand cru it was a lot more bitter than I expected for the style. The hops and citrus flavors were very pronounced with a sweetness lightly coming thru towards the finish. This is really interesting brew but I have had much better grand crus especially in this price range .Ill finish this one but wont be looking for more."
"Pours a very nice orange/amber color with cloudiness from the sediment and a thin head. Floral and spiced aroma with nutmeg and coriander standing out to my sense of smell. The malt is strong here too. Taste is malty and spicy with a sweetness at the back of the throat that is warm and nice. It feels much like cinnamon is one of the spices in this brew. Warm and inviting. I really like this ale."
"Pours a bright ruby-orange with a thick, billowing head. The head does drop pretty rapidly leaving a thin ring and plenty of lacing. The pleasant aroma of bananas and yeast gave a hint of the taste to come. The flavor is banana, clove and other spices. Theres a slight citrus tang along with a slightly sweet malt. The beer is quite carbonated and a good palate cleanser. The fruit and spice flavor was gentle, but was more than adequate to stand up to the strong flavors of the oyster casserole and the fresh minced horseradish with beef we served it with."
"It's a drinkable brew but not a session beer. A good effort of this company which makes only Belgian style ales. Keep working on it guys."
"D: Very easy to drink and can imagine enjoying this in summer as well."
"12oz bottle that I was looking forward to. Its a hazy orange color with candied fruit smells and a slightly fruity taste with grainy notes.This tastes like a belgian amber to me. This is pretty good but due to the sweetness it takes a while to drink..."
"Moderate carbonation and smooth texture produce an enviable mouthfeel, and this beer is eminently drinkable. This was a great pick, and worth grabbing several more. Delightful Warmer."
"Cloudy peach/amber color and a slim head that vanishes to scant surface lace. Large fruit aromas, pineapple, nutty malt character, and some fusels. Heartier malt base than typical with notes of nuts, cashew, and cereal grains. Hops arrive in force midway through with some pine and floral character. Some spices come into play and is blended very well. Orange notes, yeasty twang, and spices in moderation for a finish. Good mouthfeel, a tad light on the carbonation. Overall very drinkable, I could throw back a few of this without notice."
"Overall, the snowflakes on the bottle led me to belive this is more of a warmer, which it is not. Recalls any number of Unibroue beers, in my opinion. Nothing overly exciting, but I find little to fault. It's quality, but unremarkable."
"Poured into a Rapscallion glass, formed a 1/4"" beige head above the cloudy orangey amber brew. Head is down to an uneven layer of bubbles promptly, with average lacing. Swirling does rejuvenate the head and enliven the lacing. Aroma is sweet and spicy, with some vegetal hop character. Taste exhibits a pleasing balance of sweet maltiness and spicing, coupled with light fruit character and a snappy hops presence at the close. Mouthfeel is creamy smooth, and drinkability is not a problem at all. Yum."
"Overall not bad. Not my favorite from them, but in no way was this a bad brew. I would recommend giving it a shot it is a pretty good seasonal offering."
"D = Drinkability of this is good. I look forward to having more of these. Perfect with food or by itself."
"Pours a beautiful reddish orange with a somewhat thin head and some slight lacing. The smell is sweet and spicy with some characteristic Belgian yeast tang,but with a spicy edge. The taste is even fuller and spicier. Nice fruit up front with some juicy spiciness with cinammon, orange, and spiced plum. Sweet and honeyed and tang of coriander herbal bitterness at the end. Creamy and effervescent mouthfeel and light enought body to be quite drinkable, but with enought sweetness and depth of flavor to keep it interesting."
"D: Very drinkable."
"Drinkability: A very lovely Belgian Strong, and one that I know ages fairly well. Grand Cruriosity: sated!"
"Poured a dull, opaque burnt orange/red red color with a thin white head that dissipated quickly leaving a transparent white film on the top of the brew. Very light lacing with minimal adherence throughout the tasting. Smell and flavors of malt, yeast and dark fruit. Pleasant and full mouthfeel with minimal carbonation and a tangy finish. Very enjoyable seasonal; another quality beer from Allagash."
"Flavorful for a belgian stong pale that has sat for a couple of years. Spices have mellowed while the alcohol my nose detected is lost on the tongue. Thin body and forgettable finish, but this is still pleasant enough to drink. I like Allagash products. This is still very nice."
"The aroma was somewhat faint. The taste helped bring out some fruitiness and sweetness from the malt. The carbonation was a bit low and I feel that boosting it a bit may bring out more of what this beer has to offer. It was not difficult to drink, but I felt that something was missing. It is, however, an original beer and I cannot say I've had many in the past that compare to it. It was an intriguing beer that I will try again in the future."
"$8.99 750ml"
"A good quality beer - not sure I'd seek this one out over others though."
"The taste is sweet up front, settling back into a hint of spicyness and yeast. This is the last half of the bottle, and presumably is a bit yeastier than I would have experienced at the top of the bottle. Even so, it's a well balanced and complex brew. Mouthfeel is full of carbonation and tingly on the way down. A hint of alcohol warming is evident. It's a bit abrasive cold, but it really comes together and smooths out as it approaches room temp. A really nice beer that I wouldn't mind having in the beer fridge at all times."
"Drinkability is moderate. Alcohol is well hidden, but the spices are a bit to robust. Overall, this was very average, for the style."
"Pours a slightly hazy burnt orange with a lasting white head. Aroma of gingerbread, honey, caramel, vanilla, with some peppery spice and slight yeast funk. As it warms, licorice and burnt sugar (or something) start to appear. Tastes of honey, vanilla, toast, raisins, pears, slight amounts of ginger. Finishes quite earthy with a surprising amount of hop flavor. Slight flourishes of nutmeg and cinnemon, moreso in the finish. Very creamy and slightly slick, medium bodied and totally drinkable."
"This was a pretty good beer, but definitely not my favorite from Allagash. I would still buy it again."
"Comment: This is a fun beer that is a pleasure to drink and joy to experience. For newbies to the Belgium Strong Ale school this is a good first experience that will leave anyone with a sense of discretion and a love a beer eager to try another and to experience other domestic and imports form this great class of beers."
"D: Tastes great and not too heavy for a Belgian Pale Ale that is made for American pallates. Like other reviews have said before ""a great starter Belgian styled beer"" as this one I'd say relies more on the hop juicyness than on the yeast that traditional Belgians use. Still to taste is hard to beat and the abv is low enough to make this a highly drinkable beer. I had nearly the entire bottle myself and was begging for more at the end."
"Overall, I'm pretty happy with the purchase. It might be a good starter Belgian-style as it's not too alcoholic and it's not too heavy but good on the flavor."
"D: Taste great, feels great, one of the better Belgian-styles I've had. Up there with Damnation"
"..it's pronounced dumass.."
"Overall, a nice beer. I think there are solid characteristics about this one, but i can find others within the style around here that are much easier to obtain."
"D  Great beer that is easy to drink."
"Serving size is a 12 ounce bottle. Served in a chalice, the beer pours an orange/amber color with a half inch off-white head. It smells like herbs, spices, orange, cloves, and yeast. The taste is similar to the aroma, but there's also some grassy hops and apricot that I can taste. Body is medium, and the beer is smooth, creamy and a little bit dry. Drinkability is pretty good, I think it's easy to drink. The alcohol is a little bit noticable, but it's not bad at all. I like this beer a lot, I guess I'll have to wait until next winter to pick up some more of this. Not a bad choice in my opinion."
"And then with the taste, which is quite simply fantastic. Just like the aroma, hops take center stage, floral and grassy, with an understated sweetness, some great Belgian spices and again some yeast, very delicious. The mouth is above medium, kind of fully light, with pretty good carbonation, and handles the higher ABV very well. In all, this is a very good beer. I want it again."
"Pours a hazy pale amber with a thin off-white head that diminishes to a ring. The aroma has a good blend of hops and spice with a decent sweet malt backbone. A profound spiciness dominates the taste followed closely by earthy hops with malts and yeast not far behind. The beer is medium bodied with a decent amount of carbonation with slight bitterness. This is a very intriguing beer, but I'm learning to expect that with Allagash, this is very enjoyable."
"D - Alright. It is a pleasant brew with a nice warming effect. I wish I was sharing this brew, because I think the fifth is a bit much in spite of the reasonable alcohol - at least it will serve as a nice night cap. Consider that this is one of the most reasonably priced Allagash brews (and certainly no significant step down in quality from the rest of the Allagash line) I will likely have this again."
"Overall, recommended. Only thing I didn't like was that it started out extremely well, but the taste, mouthfeel and drinkability couldn't quite live up to initial impressions. I would be interested in what some aging would do to it."
"Delicious. Fruity, malty (more so than expected), some herbs and spices too. Not dry, not too sweet at all though. Refreshing to gulp, but it's too delicious to. Great body too, very soft, a perfect amount of carbonation. I'm looking forward to having this one again soon."
"D - Reasonable drinkability, probobally better with food. Reminds me of a Saison or some kind of Witbier/ Witwine."
"I'll give this one a pass in the future."
"Batch # 10. Pours from the bottle a slightly hazy amber-orange hue producing a loosely bubbled off-white and quickly fading head. Aroma is predominantly fruity-sweet and floral with a faint musty/earthy background. Pleasant smells of freshly cut pears,peaches, oranges, bananas and roasted almonds are at the forefront with subtle notes of fresh bread dough, cloves, wet earth, and wheat grass lurking in the background. Mouthfeel is full-bodied and round with a slightly elevated level of carbonation. Flavor profile was a bit more reserved compared to the aromas. Taste was initially fruity and sweet with notes of fresh orange juice, peach and pear upfront with hints of nuts, cloves, caramel malt and coriander making a contribution. Found the finish to be dry but a tad harsh and perhaps astringent. Kind of a odd contrast to the overall sweet and fruity profile of this beer. Maybe I need to sample a fresher batch next time"
"I'd probably split one with a friend, but I don't see myself getting this again. Not my style, but I'm glad I tried it."
"Very impressive, I'm not quite sure why I overlook Allagash beers so often. This is an amazingly authentic Belgian-style ale. Overlooked no more."
"Not a bad Belgian style ale and an enjoyable one it certainly can be called drinkable in every sense of the word. Personally I like a bit rawer and more aggressive flavor."
"Drinkability very good considering a modest ABV and it's refreshing taste."
"Clearly seems inspired by Duvel, especially the character of the hops, but then it goes way off on its own (including the gorgeous color). Great beer, and original."
"D: Enjoyable beer. Not a lot of depth but well crafted and quite tasty."
"750ml brown bottle from Florian's. Murky orange-amber body with a little less than an inch of off-white head. Smells sweet, fruity, and spicy. A plethora of spices dominate the flavor with more orange peel on the finish. Very well ballanced, pleasing flavor. Light to medium in mouthfeel, with a fair bit of carbonation. The combination of flavors and lighter body make this an extremely drinkable brew for the style and ABV. I'm very impressed, and am glad I picked up a couple extra bottles to cellar."
"Poured from a chilled bottle into a tulip glass, it pours a copper color with a thin eggshell surface layer. Nothing special really, but dead on style. Aroma is mainly sour plums or cranberries maybe. Hard to distinguish. Flavor is less sour than expected, but is more sweet with a butterscotch flavor that goes throughout the sip. Ending is decently dry, with a suble shot of alcohol following the swallow. A tart fruit hits up front but difficult to figure. (???) Budy is refreshing, but also smooth, with a semi-dry finish. Overall, I really like Allagash, adn this is just another strong offering in my opinion. Nothing really special, just a solid brew."
"Highly drinkable with a low-lying, creeps up on you, warming alcohol effect, very well done! I've been fortunate lately, in that I have tasted six of the very Belgian inspired, Allagash brews within the past two weeks here on the left-coast...some good stuff!"
"D- This is a great beer. Wish I would of got the 750ml bottle of this. This was my first Allagash beer and I am very excited to taste some of the others."
"Batch #14. Poured from a 750ml corked and caged bottle into my Delirium Tremens glass. Poured slowly as bottle advised but still got a pretty good head and carbonation. Was a nice rich cooper color - clear. The aroma was heavenly with yeast, citrus and lots of spice. Definitely gets you excited to try. The taste was also exceptional. Has a incredible well balanced mix of malt, spices and alcohol. It's 7.2% ABV and a Strong Pale Ale but you never taste the alcohol like some other BSPA's - I'm looking at you Delirium. The mouthfeel was also nice and solid with a creamy texture. Highly, highly recommend - you must try this one. It's a winter seasonal so get at least 2 now. One to drink right away and another to age till fall. (4.5, HR, T, Y)"
"Opinion: This is a really tasty beer. I have never been disappointed in a beer from Allagash, and this is no exception. I like the bold malt balance, and I would probably put this beer in with the Dubbel crowd rather than the Pale Ale it is classified as. This beer was even pretty reasonably priced for as tasty as it was. I would certainly drink this beer again."
"Cheers!"
"D: This is a very drinkable beer. I found myself wanting to drink more but i only bought this one single. A nice winter beer that you will find yourself drinking many of these Grand Cru's."
"GET this if you enjoy Belgians....but leave some for me."
"Notes: Very well done interpretation of the style while still achieving a unique offering. Incredibly easy to consume and interesting down to the last drop. Highly reccomended."
"Pours a clear burnt orange with a giant tan foamy head. The head is just huge, and leaves great lacing. The smell has alcohol, bread yeast, floral,sweet malt, and some spices. The taste is like the smell, full of bread yeast,alcohol, malt, floral hints, coriander, and other peppery spices. The taste is very complex,but all the flavors work and make this a very good tasting beer. The m/f is crisp,creamy and leaves a dry aftertaste. a very good beer that should not be missed. Cheers."
"Taste is good, not great. Some spice and a good bit of malt but overall it lacks the balance of hops in the taste (you can feel them though). A little citrus and organic barley/wheat present as well. Mouthfeel is nice and light with a great carbonation level across the tongue. No aftertaste. All except the taste works for me in this belgian pale, it's just lacking a little in complexity. I'm not saying not to try it, though."
"Pours a muddy dark copper, cloudy, like fresh apple cider. Some off white bubbles, but no real head. Smell is big sweetness of raisins and prunes, some buttery toffee. Very rich malty, sugary aroma. The taste is similar to the aroma although not quite as big and rich, some prune flavor and breadiness with a slight bitter snap of hops and alcohol in the finish. Medium to heavy in body, the smell predicts a much thicker, heavier body, but still fairly chewy. A low level of carbonation and a faint tingle on the tongue with a drying finish. Aroma suggests a very rich and malty beer here and although this one is still fairly big, some of the other aspects don't live up to the rich aroma."
"Overall, I'm not as impressed with this as I thought I would be. It's good, but not as good as the competition. I should note that this is my first brew from Allagash."
"it's a roasty and the hop flavor is significant. rich bready flavors such as might come from munich malts, and some spiciness"
"Pours a beautiful orange color, very clear if carefully poured. Moderately high carbonation with a big initial burst of foam quickly shrinking to a small persistent bead. Aroma is clean with hints of malt and (I think) coriander. Feels light on the tongue with pleasant malt and alcohol, slightly spicy. Hops are there but don't stand out. Very nice coriander flavor upon swallowing. Overall, very good. Not at all cloying as some beers in this style can be. Grows on my palate very quickly. Doesn't make me scream with joy but does make me smile."
"This beer is an excellent expression of yeast character and carbonation, though not a whole lot else. The tart, crisp, yeasty nature makes it drink like a witbier, but the booze can go to your head. The most disapponting bit is the smell - I can't shake the conception that this smells like overcooked high-protein grains. Most of all, though, if you do pop this bottle, do it at about 55-60 degrees - any colder or warmer and the character is lost."
"Pours a slightly hazed dried apricot with a 1/2"" head that maintains well and leaves web-like lacing with each sip. Aroma is very bready and nutty with a hint of grain and some yeast spiciness. Taste again, is malty, almost chewy, with some coriander, stone fruits, and yeasty phenols. Finishes kind of dry. No taste of alcohol. I get some flowery flavors in there as well, along with some critrus hops. Mouthfeel is soft, fluffy, and with a nearly perfect carbonation. This is a quick one to go down and filled with flavor. I love it. Goes well with black-eye peas, turnip greens, and cornbread."
"PS: A wonderful compliment to some Arkansas Ham."
"Nice beer here. Not much head on the pour or lacing. Pours an off copper color, smells of burnt peaches. Has an almost peachy, apricot and caramel sweet taste to it. Very crisp, clean and smooth. Easy to drink and doesn't seem to carry the 7.2% abv, but it does hit you. I like this one and it is reasonably priced so I will be revisiting it."
"D - A very good Christmas selection and a good representation of the style. I'm going to find another to save for next year."
"The body had a mid to full feel. Carbonation is limited but is for real. A good beer overall. At least I know what to order next call."
"Overall, quite good. Sessionable. Almost Saison like, just not as much citrus character. For me, almost too sweet and light."
"Poured into a pint glass. Appearance cloudy orange with 2cm pour of frothy white head, next to no lacing. Smells of apricot, apples, citrus, yeast, spices, and some nuts, really great smell. Tastes very fruity (apples, pears, apricot) with some spices and a hint of hops, quite earthy. Very bubbly in the mouth with a slight dry finish. A good effort of a grand cru, but I've had better. Worth a try though."
"I love almost all of the Allagash beers, but have never had the chance to grab the grand cru until this year. My bottle said it was batch #14. Poured into a red wine glass a great looking dark pumpkin orange color, with a big head at first that eventually became quite a bit smaller, but held up quite well until the end. Smell was almost masked by the clean smell of the glass, but the strong fruit aromas came through sure enough, with some spicy clove and other spices in there too. Taste didn't exactly jump out at me, but was quite nice, with more fruit sweetness and a buttery texture. Alcohol could definitely be detected, but was not too overpowering. Mouthfeel was medium bodied, and very easy to drink. There was a definite warming factor on this beer, but even so, this beer would be great just about any time of year. Nice beer, not my favorite by Allagash, but still better then most beers I come across. It went well with some port cheese and crackers."
"Drinks pretty easy despite the complexity. I think this ot really a Belgian Pale, but as it says a Grand Cru or brown to me, except for the yrast profile (way to clean tasting) , any way you look at it, yummy & fairly complex. Easily my favorite from this brewery (so far)"
"This beer will be better with age, at least that's my prediction."
"Very drinkable."
"D- Good, but it isn't anything special to me. I like the boldness of a real BSPA. This comes up a little to thin to be really memorable."
"Pours a nice amber color with a soft white head leaving some lacing and lasted with the glass. Smell of some coriander and very breadlike, but not real exciting. Taste is bread-y, with some spices coming into play as well. Seemed a bit simple, I seem to have missed out on some of the fruit flavors others have described; different batch? Mouthfeel felt like too much carbonation and lighter side of medium bodied. This was probably worth a try, but I don't think I'll be seeking this one out again."
"The mouthfeel is carbonated at first, but finishes a dry pleasant spicyness."
"A pretty nice beer, but no wow-factor here. Smells of fruit and corriander, almost like a beefed up wit. Tastes of creme and candied oranges with a little spice and corriander. Very smooth and easy drinking. Basically a well-crafted and balanced belgian, but lacks complexity."
"I highly suugest this ale as a side to a hearty dinner with its full flavors."
"Quite a drinkable brew and another winner from Allagash. It's like a pumped up witbier."
"Very drinkable  for the American price around $6 a bomber  this is a darn good deal."
"One of the better regular offerings from Allagash IMO. Aside from their hand printed label series, this one is the winner. The white and triple are solid as well, but this takes the cake."
"Drinkability: I think aging this for another year would've been perfect, the hops are a little load for the style and this beer. Not bad overall, but I will have a hard time drinking much of this."
"D: It feels like it's freaking freezing outside right now (it's only 63) but I felt like I needed something warming. This is definitely warming. Though the abv was a manageble 7.2%, a 12 ounce bottle was plenty for me. It's not that the alcohol wasn't hidden well, it's that it's a bit too bold for a session beer. I would get this again, for sure."
"Pours an orange amber color with a small off white head. Aroma of candy sugar, some spice and a sweet malt. Malty sweet taste, also included some spice as well. Orange citrus, and some wheat were also rather prominent in the taste. Very warming on the way down. More so that I would have expected seeing how this is only 7.2%."
"Drinkability - pretty good, but not great. I'd have somehting else after one 750 ml of these."
"Where most Belgian versions are more subtle in their displayal of malt, fruit, and spice; there's no such finesse here. This beer is bold, vivid, and rich from sip to finish."
"Poured from it's 750ml bottle that is marked Batch #10. Pours a slightly hazy amber color with a light tan head. Smell is absolutely delightful. Notes of citrus, spices and yeast are all present in the nose. Taste is dry and crisp with orange, spices and yeast that ends peppery. Overall a wonderful brew from Allagash that is highly recommended, especially if you love Belgian Strong Pale Ale's like I do."
"I could drink a couple of these after dinner anytime. I really enjoyed this beer."
"A nice take on the belgian pale ale style. Use it as a replacement for SA to make your meals fancier! Amber pour with a nice frothy head, lacing that lasts. Smell is spicy and grassy hops. A nice hoppy bite, mostly grassy, but some citrus. Taste is quite mellow, with few discernable fruits. I mostly get molasses and caramel. A little weak for me. Slightly metallic aftertaste, but otherwise clean. Not too carbonated. Scrubbing bubbles for your palate!"
" Complex, fruity flavor with woody tones and a sweet malty aftertaste. Mouthfeel is lively but not too bubbly. Nicely refreshing and easy to drink."
"Flavour is very well-balanced, with both big hops and malt. American citrus hops (piney), flowers. Slightly sour aftertaste, and a good body and mouthfeel."
"Purchased this past winter and cellared for a few months since. Batch # 11 marked on the 750 mL bottle."
"Im liking this one. Its very light, but tart and spicy. Theres something to be said for the efficient simplicity of this one."
"Overall, a good beer and nicely priced for its quality."
"Ahhh, the Allagash Grand Cru is a mighty fine brew. It pours from the bottle a relatively dark golden color, verging on an amber. The head is frothy at first but does not stick around long. The smell is nice: aromas of fruity esters waft up to the nose. The taste is malty and hoppy, with a sweet flavoring mixing with the hops bittering. A slightly thick, some what sticky, after taste. A very nice beer."
"A real treat, thanks to waughbrew for the trade!"
"Amazing how much the character of this beer has changed since fresh."
"smooth and decently(but not well)-balanced"
"D: A delicious Belgian ale with many pleasing aspects and an alcohol level that allows for generous enjoyment."
"A very nice brew indeed. Pours a radiant golden orange with a light head. Smells enticing with wisps of honey and sweet oranges. Tastes brings out more of the same with a spicy dash of coriander. Dry, crisp and refreshing. I'd prefer this on a hot summer day as opposed to a winter seasonal."
"I can't say I'm sad that I only have a half bottle to share. I can say that I regret paying for said bottle."
"Highly drinkable and unexplainably delicious. Interesting cross-continental creation, delivering the desireable Belgian-Abbey style flavors with a spark of Pacific NW hops infusions. Game on."
"The acidity, spice, and sweetness masks the 7.2%abv very well. Your typically well crafted Belgian offering from Allagash."
"Flavor was a tad sweet and citrusy. Hints of lemon and honey coming through. Slight carbonation. It was served from the bottle into a chilled glass.. the flavor intensified as the glass warmed. A sure bet for a Belgian strong pale (from the US!)"
"Definitely a good brew, but not the absolute best that Allagash has to offer. Still, its crisp and very drinkable. Recommended."
"On tap at the Flying Pig in Malvern. The beer poured a browish copper color with a slight head but good carbonation and bubble activity. The aroma gave me some corriander and other spices melting together a citrus feel. The taste is a balance between the spice and the fruit tones and is enjoyable but the taste does not linger for long."
"Overall a good Belgian Pale, but way too crisp. A solid offering though."
"Overall: Yet another solid offering from Allagash. I note ""solid"" because while this is a worthy brew nothing stands out to set it above and beyond. A quality brew nonetheless that deserves a find every winter!"
"Body is a hair below medium with playfull carbonation and a airey, bubbly mouthfeel and slick, smooth texture. Creamy."
"Mouth feel is medium bodied and actively carbonated."
"Pours a hazy golden honey color with a small head that soon disappears. Served in a glass chalice. Smells of wheat and coriandor. Taste is as expected from the smell and very good. Spices are noticealbe and well done. Mouthfeel is good and drinkability is good. I will look for this again."
"Rich mahogony color with about a couple of fingers of fluffy head. Interesting aroma, there is the spicy yeast and some citrus, but also chocolate and toffee. A nutty flavor with some toffee, cloves, and maybe a little black pepper. Nice citrusy background. Medium bodied and well carbonated. This is a really solid offering from Allagash, I'm excited to try more of their line."
"This is an honorable beer, just not something that I would drink all of the time. I am anxious to cellar the rest of these and see how they turn out. I guess for what it is, it is a good example. Again, just not a style for me I guess."
"All in all I thought it was a very good Belgian with some unique flavors from beginning to end."
"Another excellent offering from Allagash."
"I agree with previous comments on this beer that it could benefit from some time in the cellar to refine the (slightly rough)carbonation and mellow out the finish."
"The taste was excellent with a variety of fruity flavors slowly overtaking the dominant malt flavor. Each sip evolved into another experience; just great for this style. A bit too sour in the aftertaste with a rush of flavors. I think this beer needs to be aged for a few months to mellow out the 'sharp' edges, very powerful flavors. Still a very good beer and can be enjoyed again and again."
"Pours a hazy dull orange with a fluffy, rocky head that never fully reduces. The nose reveals much spiciness, coriander white pepper and some fruit. Terrifically flavored. At first theres quite a strong hop bitterness, drying, then buttery, mellow malts smooth it all away before a nice whack of spice through the finish. A myriad of of constantly evolving flavors, apricot, pear, apple, slight citrus pith, faint banana and spices--coriander and white pepper, strong through the finish. Quite complex. Mouthfeel is medium full, just right, with soft fluffy carbonation. Extremely drinkable. This is the first of the allagash lineup i've tried, not sure why i've put it off so long. This is tremendous."
"good drinkability; i definitely wanted another. another nice belgian style from a good domestic brewery."
"Drinkability: A very drinkable ale, it comes SOOO close to being excellent. Instead, it has to settle for being pretty good."
"Copper brown in color, it pours looking very clear at first until more of the bottom sediment mixes in to add cloudiness. Has a decent head of foam that dissipates fairly quickly. Active carbonation present. Smells of fruits like apple and citrus peel, it is slightly alcoholic and has that distinct aroma of Belgian yeasts. Has a fruity malt flavor, mildly phenolic and subtly spicy, and with a delicate bitter finish. Very smooth in character, somewhat bubbly. The overall enjoyment is quite good to start, but it diminishes some over time."
"Overall, I think this is another more than respectable offering from this fine Maine brewery. It is tasty, but not overwhelmingly strong. Very drinkable, while packing a substantial punch at the same time."
"D - Another highly drinkable offering from Allagash. A unique flavor that really makes you want more."
"From Batch #9. Hazy, deep orange/caramel colour with a short, dense, off-white head. Nice retention and fine lacing. Fruity aroma of fresh apple and pear, mixed with a light spice. Mellow fruity flavour, apple skins but no cidery character. Light spice and slight tartness balanced by caramel throughout. Some breadiness at the end with a peppery tingle in the finish. Low carbonation, but still with a little life to it. The texture was on the creamy side too. Great balance of flavours and highly drinkable. Thanks Viggo!"
"12 oz bottle poured into a Duvel tulip, this is a dark glowing copper/mahogony with two fingers ofoff-white head, decent retention, moderate lacing. Nose is yeasty and spicey, with notes of orange peels, coriander, clove, and a musty earthy smell. Taste is a light fruity malt with a good deal of spices, apple, pear, orange, mango followed with pepper, cloves, coriander, some slight hops. Nicely flavorful and well balanced, medium/full mouthfeel with a nice refreshing carbonation, this is a really easy drinker. This is the first time I've tried this beer, and I must say it's one of the better offerings I've tried from Allagash."
"This is a well balanced very tasty beer full bodied beer. It's not overly spicy like other Belgian style ales and is easy to drink."
"Nice orange/gold color with a good head.Smells a little malty to me. The taste is spicy and fruity; I think mostly orange. It feels great in my mouth, and is a wonderfully drinkable beer. Good taste on it,s own, and great with foods. One of the first seasonals I ever tried, and still one of my favorites."
"from the bottle. poured amber brown, with a big off white head, that left some lacing. aroma like the description says got smoke, licorice, orange, yeast a whiff of alcohol and spices. the flavor,got he same as the aroma but the alcohol came out stronger as it warmed, a good beer"
"Pours a murky golden amber, with a thick beige head that retains well and leaves nice lacing. The aroma is authentically belgian, with a big spiced character (corriander, clove, curacao, anise), as well as light candied sugar, fruity yeast, biscuit, and some earthy, grassy hops. The taste starts out quite spicy (curacao, clove, corriander, anise), followed by some toasted bread and biscuit malt character, white grape, orange, candied sugar, grassy hops, and a light alcohol presence. The mouthfeel is medium, with crisp carbonation, and drinkability is good. This beer improves dramamtically as it warms, so dont drink it too cold. An excellent belgian style offering from allagash, somewhat similar to la fin du monde but easier drinking...definately something to look for in the winter season."
"Taste: Mid to low carbonation, the yeasty spices shine a bit more in the palate. Again some orange zest, and firm malt sweetness comparable to peach and papaya sugars. Decent hop finish gives the aftertaste a feeling of unripe fruits, apples mostly."
"Pours a pumpkin cider-like color with a fantastic, boisterous head. Thick sheets of lace cling to the sides of my glass. Aromas are spicy. Coriander, pepper, allspice, candied fruit rinds, and honey. Flavor is wonderful. Mix of spcies, honey, doughy sweetness, sweet citrus fruit. Mildly medicinal alcohol flavor at the end. Drier in the finish than expected, but it allows some more of the spicy zing to sit on the palate. Bubbly and thick at the same time. Extremely drinkable. Thanks Chadbrew for this gem from Allagash!"
"Another great Allagash product."
"Found one of these in my cellar last night and figured it was a good time for it. Pours a cloudy light brown color with a large head that has good retention and leaves plenty of lacing on the glass. The aroma is malty with some spice and citrus. Nice. The flavor has a lot of orange as well as a strong bready malt character. The alcohol makes itself known as well. The mouthfeel is moderate and the drinkability is very good. Nice brew."
"Pours a hazy brown/orange, medium thick white head, nice lacing all over. Smell is apples, sweet orange, spice, alcohol, caramel and honey. Taste is apples. orange, spice, yeast, vanilla, butterscotch, and some banana. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, butter smooth carbonation. Excellent beer."
"With the low alcohol content, this beer really winds up being a super easy drinker. Enough flavor to keep anyone interested, I think. It's listed as a winter seasonal, but this is a total year-round brew."
"12 oz. served in a snifter. Pours a golden orange with a half-inch head that leaves some lacing. Smells like pepper, coriander, oranges, hops, and some alcohol. The body is smooth right off the bat, thick and malty with spices, pepper, fruitiness, and a low hop presence. The spices meld with the beer flavors wonderfully. It's like a beefed-up version of their witbier - very tasty and quite drinkable. Hard to put down."
"Drinkability: Awesome. The label describes this as gentle, and it really is; the beer's a cool breeze. Very Fantome-like spicing and spirit -- that's good. Tremendous balance, favor and subtlety. My favorite Allagash beer by leaps and bounds. Truely wonderful beer."
"2004 vintage, batch number 9. pours a hazy, muddy, caramel-colored brown with orange highlights in a chalice. head is a tight yellow-white 1 inch. initial aroma is lightly spicy with some corriander and a touch of clove. fruity with some phenolic alcohol as well. first taste is corriander and cloves with some pepper. not overly bitter, as this is a well balanced beer at this time. i imagine a fresh bottle will be more hoppy. feels a little like champagne in your mouth. good carbonation and creamy mouthfeel and swallow. nice warming effect as well. alcohol becomes apparent by the end of the first chalice making known that this is a sipper. some caramalized orange and other fruit as this brew warms. somewhat dry, yeasty finish. overall, a nice belgian strong pale ale. a mild, calm, chilled out version. i'm excited to compare a fresh bottle with tonight's experience."
"I think this is a great beer. My advice is don't let this brew pass you by."
"This is an excellent strong pale ale."
"This is a world-class brew. Truly the best of Allagash. They call it the grand cru for a reason."
"12 oz. bottle, poured into my Brewery Ommegang flute/chalice thang. Hazy amber with a short-lived fizzy head that settles to a thin cap. Nose is fruity, yeasty, almost smells like a white wine. Deliciously spicy (coriander? Orange peel?), some bittering hops, Saaz maybe, and a wonderful dry finish. Theres definitely some alcohol spice running down the throat, too. Slightly minerally aftertaste  not unpleasant at all. Lingering dull-bitter medicine taste. Intriguing. Mouthfeel is full, bready almost. Increasingly complex as it warms. Drinkability is quite high, because I want to continue trying to figure this one out. A fascinating beer  Ill definitely pick up more of this next time I hit Beers of the World. Id love to sample this from a 750 mL bottle to see if its any different from the shorties."
"I eagerly await this beers arrival every winter and have for the past 7 years. One of my favorites!!"
"Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: A nice medium bodied ale. Very crisp taste and clean mouthfeel."
"When poured it was deep brown in color with some tight tan foam. The smell was sort of complex. It seem to have all kinds of aroma's that is hard to define. But the taste told the story. I could taste fruit, spices and roasted malts. Fruit like orange and spice like cloves. Well balanced and very exciting Belgium Style Ale!"
"Served from a corked and caged 750ml bottle, batch number 4. It sits in my orval chalice a medium brown with very clear red highlights around the edges. Much darker than I think of Belgian Strong Pale Ales as this is classified on BA. A medium sized white head forms and quickly fades leaving a filmy coating that remains the whole time. It has a very complex nose filled with a wide variety of aromas that intertwine nicely. A yeast presence dominates, but there is also some spice (pepper), some fruit (plums), some candy (licorice), and a nice malt backbone. The taste is equally complex. The belgian yeastiness dominates in the beginning, but is quickly overtaken by a dark fruity taste....think plums...think candied plums. After the fruit there is a spiciness element caused both by the alcohol and yeast, plus the bottle says it is brewed with spices. I can't pick out the individual spices, but it seems peppery. It finishes with a surprisingly strong hit of alcohol considering it's only 7.2%. A sweetness emerges in the aftertaste, most likely a remnant of the dark fruits noticed earlier and the nice malt base. All of these various flavors meld into a very complex, interesting, and great tasting beer. The mouthfeel is creamier than most Belgian-styles I've tried and it has a typically strong carbonation level. The drinkability must be high because I had no problem finishing the 750ml by myself. I just recently discovered Allagash, but I'm already realizing what a great brewery they are. It's great that there are two breweries making world class Belgian-style beer in the Northeast."
"I plan on trying this again in the future with an older sample."
"D - Divinely drinkable. Seems darker in A and T than other Belgian Strong Pale Ales, but who cares? Its great"
"Nice browned amber with a white-tan head that isn't going anywhere. Large smell of carmel malt mixed with candi sugar laced through with a smell of orange and corriander. The taste explodes and then lingers. Starting with a large malt that gives up its sweetness and fades back to the citrus tones. The body is very solid and holds up well. Great beer, give me more, winter spring or fall."
"Allagash Grand Cru pours a cloudy bronze, capped with an immense, impossibly fine white head that lasts forever. Simply gorgeous. Its smell, malty and spiced, is very good in its own right, but simply does not prepare you for the deliciousness of the flavor. The maltiness, hoppiness, and spicedness complement each other in such a perfect fashion that I'm struggling to put words to it. The mouthfeel is the icing on the cake, light and frothy. The 7.2% ABV is imperceptible. Fucking sublime."
"D - This beer gets better and better with each sip, and the alcohol is so well suppressed that it wouldn't be hard to reach for and pour another - especially since it's got a twist-off cap. Heh heh. Seriously though, this beer is very easy to drink. But I still hate twist-offs."
"pours a thin, iced-tea like reddish-orange. lots of big bubbles in the body with a thin ring of residual foam. minimal lacing. nose on this beer is amazing.. very clovey and spicy with plums and orange liqueur. some yeasty age as well. flavor introduces maltiness and plays off the orange nicely. a big belgian for 7+%, this is a nice sipper and competitively priced for such a successful belgian clone. heat is starting to mellow with a year on it, and the fruity development of the nose compliments the flavor beautifully. freshness indicated that this beer needs some time, and boy was i right. mouthfeel isn't as thin as it looks, and feels good going down. slight warming. drinkability suffers due to big flavor and a slight excess of alcoholiness for the abv.. otherwise a nice brew that all new englanders should be proud of."
"This golden-orange colored beer poured a big fluffy white head that is leaving a nice splotchy lace down my glass. Head retention is still strong after half a glass. Nose is full of peppery spices. Taste is a nice blend of malts, bittering hops, and peppery spices. Mouthfeel is nice, full and lively. Overall drinkability is very good. My first sampling of Allagash is very good!"
"Drinkability is great this is a wonderful brew or I was in the mood for it one."
"Drinkability is great on this excellent brew, it would seem more fitting around the holiday season with all those spices, but will gladly enjoy this one year round!"
"Great brew, don't miss it."
"Overall, it is definitely worth a purchase."
"Bottle: Poured a slightly cloudy copper brown color ale with a huge off-white foamy head with perfect retention. Aroma is quite the spice mix with some Belgian yeast and caramel malt. Taste is also very interesting at first with some spices and caramel crating a huge full body beer (which seems to be more then 7.5%) with a slight bitter finish with some great medium funky yeast. I found the aftertaste was a bit thin and watery which would be my only complaint. Great Belgian"
"Drinkability: This beer is beautiful and complex. I will gladly buy another bottle of it. No harsh or offensive flavors, just good beer. I really like the spicines balances with the big malty base. Compliments to the brewer."
"Drinkability is exceedingly high. Smooth and easily quaffed. Fairly well balanced (spice just a little too much, hops a little under-represented), a nice complexity but could use a few more layers to the flavor. Still, highly recommended and a truly fine brew."
"This is a great looking beer. Pours deep sunset orange with a frothy head. Head dissipated quickly, what was left was magical. Huge fruit aromas, orange, peach, pear. This beer does have a fair amount of spice (clove), but is not as bitey as some other BSA I've had. The taste is wonderful- remember when you where a kid and you had a Libby's peach juice, well this is it, only better...you know why. The taste goes front to back, delicious! Awesome beer!"
"I really enjoyed this beer. I had it with pasta mixed in a butter sauce, and the spices provided a contrast to the relative thickness of the food. Higher-than-average alcohol content makes this beer less suitable for a ""session."" I am certain to return to this beer when I want to taste this style again."
"Finger licking good!"
"Drinkable: This is no session brew or one I would rush out for, but yes, worth another. Cracked this one open just after ordering the first local crabs of the season. This was a nice segue to that spicy seafood mix."
"Pours out a honey blonde. Small head that dissipates. Opaque in my glass. Smell is malt and yeast, with a little candy feel to it. Smooth taste, malty sweet a little bitter overtone with a spice backbone. Orange zest, maybe coriander in there too. Mouthfeel is somewhat silky. Very drinable as the aftertaste is very pleasant. A very solid offering."
"Starts off extremely sweet, with hints of orange, pineapple, and other fruits. Very citrusy. Bitterness is low. Light carbonation makes for a smooth and easily quaffable brew. The high alcohol is hidden very well. A complex brew and one that I can really only scratch the surface of. Words don't do it justice. So easy to drink that it'll inevitably sneak up on you and get you hammered, so take it easy."
"I recently had the privilage to share a 750ml of this with a friend from Batch #1. Yep, #1, so it's about 5-6 years old. Neither of us knew yet what to expect but the bottle opened with a nice pop and the beer poured out with a very nice fluffy head and almost no sediment. Smell was rich, malty, spicy. Taste... wow so different than a fresh example. It developed a very smokey characteristic that was great with the spicy yet smooth texture of the beer. Somewhat sweet. I always felt that this beer could use a little time in the cellar. Its nice to see that such an old bottle has held up so well. It was my friend's last bottle of the Batch 1, so sadly I'll probably never have it again. Now to find a bottle from batch 2...."
"Thanks again to Brewguru for the offering. Great trade all around Joe!"
"750 ml corked and bailed bottle. Batch 3, 7.2% ABV. This one must have came out in 2002 and I need to clean out the fridge."
"Drinkability and Overall: Stunning. One of Allagash's best. I'm thoroughly impressed with this beer. It's simple serenity keeps you drinking the entire 750ml bottle. I'm very happy with this, and plan on getting more in the near future. Enjoy it."
"Allagash does it again. Please keep making more and trying new things -- this is a fine beer!"
"Another incredible beer from Allagash brewery in Portland, Maine. Recommended."
"Despite the citrus flavors, it's a great deal less acidic than many Belgian styles I've tried, and as such is probably the most drinkable I've ever tasted. High marks all around."
"Batch #7. Been in the closet for a while so I decided to give it a shot. Poured a rich amber in color, with a thick and creamy head. Lace stuck to the sides of the goblet. The carbonation was rising quite steadily in a column from the stem of the glass (quite pretty). The nose is sugar and spice, all of which is very nice (oh, and some caramel too). The taste is citrusy, with sugars that push through the malts. Also other spices, akin to Mexican mole. The alcohol is nicely hidden behind all of the sugars. The tongue is nice and crisp."
"Mouthfeel is smooth, with an abundance of small, bubbly carbonation..maybe a bit too much. This is a great winter brew and made for a nice nightcap for me. Another winner from Allagash and one I look forward to having again!"
"Good stuff, I'm glad I picked up a sixer of this stuff. Do pick this up."
"Drinkability- A very nice brew. As I said before, wasn't expecting this beer to be a sweet as it was. So, I guess that was a pleasant suprise. Was expecting it to be around 8-9% with the flavors and thickness it gave off. Good one to try though."
"Pours a murky brown amber color, kind of drab with a bit of fizzly head. Smells like yeast and spices, and also sort of like iced tea or something. Taste just isn't working with me here. Oily and spicy and unrefreshing. Just not what a beer should be in my opinion. Tastes like tea. A little sour tasting too. Yuk. Not particularly impressive in the mouthfeel and the drinkability was horrible, I could taste the alcohol and it wasn't a good mix with the oily spicy herby tastes that were happening. I think I owe it to Allagash to try this one again sometime if I can bring myself to do it, because it seemed to get high marks from everyone else and Allagash is such a strong brewery I was surprised to see such a weak beer from them. Oh well. Live and learn."
"Nice burnt orange color, small head, some lacing is noted. I get some phenolics and alcohol notes in the aroma. Taste takes a bit to grow on me. It is a nice marrige of a little bit of sour, then a bit of sweet to balance it. It also starts kinda heavy but finishs clean on the mouthfeel. Perhaps I just don't *get* belgian style beers. I think this is a decent beer, but just not all that, so figure that into my review."
"Given the seamless interplay of sweet-bitter, sweet-dry, fruity-spicy and the velvety (yet angelically light) mouthfeel, this is one well-crafted beer and is my favorite Allagash offering to date. If Grand Cru is less a specific style than an appellation to be bestowed upon a brewery's proudest achievement, then this beer is aptly named."
"This was poured into a tulip glass a light copper color, slightly hazy with a thick cream colored head. Aroma had mild hop flowers and caramel sweetness. Slightly yeasty, bready taste with bold candy sweetness. Light hop bitterness. I feared an abundance of alcohol would show up in this beer. Alcohol heat did come, but only in the finish, and it didnt detract from the quality of the brew. Medium slick mouth feel. Very drinkable."
"Good carbonation levbel with a nice full mouthfeel."
"Excellent beer. Aromatic and tasty. Great drinkability."
"12 ounce bottle. Murky orange brown color with an off-white head. Lots of spices in the aroma, including coriandor. Yeast smell as well. Very malty with yeast flavors, sugar, fruits (reminds me of pineapple orange juice), and spices (coriander again). Full mouthfeel. High carbonation masks the alcohol. This is one of those beers that is hard to put down because its so tasty and drinkable, and I have to continually remind myself to slow down. Anyone who says that the U.S. cant make Belgian style beers hasnt tried this one."
"I wanted another 750 by the end of this."
"12 oz bottle pours cloudy orange-amber with a nice bubbly off white head that lasts, leaves a sticky lacing in my glass. Spicy clove and fruity aromas, sweet pear, melon and spicy pepper flavors, medium body with a crisp, carbonated mouthfeel, spicy finish, wow this is phenomenal."
"Last Swigs: Extremely complex Heath bar caramel. Novel beer, and what that means is that you better be ready to read a novel when you krak a big bottle. This leaves a coating of all coatings on me tongue. Plenty of mixed sweet spice with doughy waffle malts. So much for tasting other beers tnite. This one did me in."
"deep hazy orange/brown with a light tan head. vinous aromas, with many other fruity aromas, orange, cherry, and lemon to name a few. toffee aromas with clove and allspice. the taste consists of dark fruitiness, citrus, and spicey clove and allspice flavors. a delicate malty caramel toffee taste shows up after some warming along with brown sugar. the almost 8% abv is masked very well, with almost no alcohol flavor. medium to full bodied with a pleasant amount of carbonation. i'm really pretty impressed with this beer. it's quite complex and very drinkable. this is one that worth coming back to."
"I love the beers from these guys, and this one hit the spot as well. It's a deep golden little feller that sports a generous fluffy pillow of head and plenty of lace as well. The aromas are much like the wit beer with coriander and citrus. In fact, this is for me, a Winter version of the wit. It is a beefed up, spiked and fatter version of the wit indeed. What I like about this brew is that it is ever so gulpable in the same way the wit is, but it warms the soul real quick and reminds the drinker that it is indeed....Winter. This beer is perfect fireside-delicious"
"Bender Factor: The alcohol is there, you can taste it, but somehow it is still decieving."
"Here we are, the main event... batch seven is up in the house tonight. A lovely amber color with a huge shite head takes things downtown for appearance. Taste is nice and balanced between sweet and spunky with a smooothness that lasts and lasts. There are spices to the day, but the hops and malts almost balance it all away. This is a solid Belgian style brew."
"Drinkability: Drinking this made me long for a DFH 90 Minute IPA, not another one of these."
"I started off pouring this too fast which resulted in a tremendous thick tan head. When settled a few minutes later the beer maintained a small lace and an incredible sweet aroma. I noticed that the flavor improved tremedously after warming up a little releasing banana like fruit aftermaths. It was tough to see my hand through the pint of this dark caramel color. Overall, I loved this beer and can't wait to try the Allagash white I have sitting in my fridge for tonight."
"Drinkability: I can't see this being a session beer but it had a complex character and a nice sipping beer. I'm sure it would be better in the winter with a nice soup."
"Corked and Caged - Labled as Batch Four. I was expecting a ""big"" malty beer. It was a good beer but not the one I was expecting. Poured into a Westmalle Goblet, a big rocky head that receded slowly leaving some nice lacing. Aroma was slightly fruity, slightly sweet, not at all over-powering. Same goes for the taste, very drinkable but not overly complex. Attractive copper color was however very pleasing to the eye."
"Big bottle from Batch 7. Candied fleshy fruit aroma with a pinch of spice. Medium sized, yellowish cream colored head is nice and sticky leaving rings of lace. Deep caramel apricot colored beer with a streams of tiny bubbles rising from the center of the glass. Mild flavor, a bit of fruit and coriander, mild malts and some alcohol towards the end that moves down to the stomach. Mouthfeel is high in carbonation making the beer light on the tongue. A nice beer, aroma is stronger then flavor, but both have lots going on. I'll take another.."
"12oz. bottle poured into a pint glass. It pours a light copper color with one finger of head. The smell is sweet with fresh pear and a bit of caramel. A healthy dose of ethanol in the nose as well. Very invigorating aromas. The taste is sweet and malty, with some white grapes. A bit of alcohol and just a slight slight bit of phenolics. The mouthfeel is thick and strong. The drinkability suffers a little due to the alcohol. Another nice one from Allagash."
"-Oelergud"
"Nice and murky golden color with a beautiful creamy light tan head. Smells yeasty and spicy though the smell is not strong, tastes powerfully malty and sweet, with cinnamon\clove notes and delicious raisin\peach flavor. If you could blend up and brew fruitcake it would taste something like this. A bit of ginger in the aftertaste, good drinkablility as it's not as strong alcohol-wise as I expected and the aftertaste is really mellow. Kind of a weird time to be drinking it (August) but since I'm sitting right in front of the air conditioner..."
"I picked up a nice tulip glass today and decided to see what this beer was like with it. The head pours about 2 fingers high and a nice off white/cream color. The head doesn't fall too far, but where it does, it leaves a very heavy lace on the glass. This bumped up my appearance score from a 4.0 to a 4.5"
"Now here is a lively, mustard-infused, scorched pineapple, baked peach, peanut sauce-flavored ale. Unlike the FOUR, this is wild and willy. Only the texture is lean and braced with sooty, metallic tannins. I guess my impression that Allagash could do no wrong was naiive. This is not a bad beer. And it is fascinating to behold. But don't expect virtuoso balance, curls of insight or high drama. This is an experiment that resulted in a moderately drinkable, strong, slightly wierd-tasting ale."
"Tasting it, I noticed a very rich maltiness that was strong but not overpowering, some faint fruity overtones, and some hoppiness (but not much). It was overall a good beer. If offered, I would drink it again with no problem, but with so many hundreds of new beers yet to try, I wouldn't go out of my way to buy one. I liked it, and it was very good, but I have had better. I liked their double ale more."
"The beer pours a dark orange color with a thick off-white head. The aroma is good. It has a nice pale malt scent with the aroma of spices and light crystal malts. There is a fruity Belgian yeast scent as well. The taste is good. It has a warm, yet spicey pale and light crystal malt flavor. It goes down easy with a fruity Belgian style finish. It has a corriander taste on the way down; very nice. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a fine Belgian beer. It has good flavor and excellent mouthfeel; a good drinker."
"This reminds me very much of a Unibroue product, and that is a compliment. Not as complex, rich, or heavy as other Grand Cru's, but satisfying none-the-less. Somewhat of a crossover between a Wit and a Dubbel. Very good."
"Drinkability - I blew through the sixer in 2 days. Very tasty, what you refrain from in quantity you will make up for in quality."
"Spiced Belgian style, very similiar to Unibroue. Excellent aroma, nice white creamy foam and carbation. Cloudy orange brown color. Yeast with noticeable pieces. Moderate malt and citrus orange peel, pear, hint bannana very pleasant fruit and herbs. Coriander (which may reduce fertility). Bonus for complexity. Good competition for wine."
"Allagash Grand Cru was served from a corked and caged 750ml bottle labeled batch #7 Once settled in Duvel tulip, the beer was a hazy caramel-orange hue, and was topped with a small light tan head that left thick n' fine lacing. The nose packed a enjoyable punch of citrus and spice...lemon/lime peel, coriander, mushroom, and sweet earthy malt. On the palate, I experienced well-developed flavors of earthy dark sugar malts that were integrated well with restrained spicy accents of coriander, bitter orange peel, indecipherable fruity esters, ripe plantain, and light mollases. A touch of alcohol is noticable in the nicely bittered finish. Lingering bitter orange-peel and pear flavors last past several seconds after the finish. The body was quite thick, but the carbonation countered this, resulting in a feel that went very well with the flavors. Well balanced and and not overly sweet, this was a very drinkable strong Belgian. This Grand Cru is a well done effort, and shows that Allagash is quite competent in delivering good Belgian-style brews."
"Soft & sweet malt, gives way to a muted orange fruitiness, & notes of cinnamon, allspice, & anise. Smooth, medium bodied, & easy carbonation."
"This is good stuff. I found some in March while in NJ, and at $6.99 for a six pack, I thought I was dreaming. I brought it back and elected to pour it in a bordeaux glass, because my glass selection was limited. Oh, man. It pours a beautiful reddish brown, and immeadiately a wonderful sweet banana, orange, pear, lemon, sugarcane, brandy, jeez, walnut...I can't even say.. smell washes over. It has a nice little tan head, that sits happily above its rich body. It had a suprising mouthfeel. Thinner than I expected given the smell of it. The taste is remarkable. Smooth, slick little hops peak through the rich malts and esters. The body is great! If it was any thicker, I wouldn't have enjoyed it so much ( or finished the 6 pack). It's wonderful and I reccommend getting your hands on it at any cost. I'm glad I caught it sort of pre-aged as i'm sure it was bottled in the fall. I'd like to have it from a well kept bomber someday. Absolutely great."
"It is a light, glowing amber in color. The aroma has a lot of hop character to it. The body is smooth, full and malty sweet with orange notes. The finish is spicy and bitter. This is a well done beer that has good complexities and is very tasty. I would like to see what it is like in a year from now."
"This is an excellent beer  slightly hazy, as per the style, orangey gold in color with a low carbonation. There is a beautiful hop aroma of fruits and pine radiating from the thin white head, along side a sweet and spicy candy maltiness. The taste is medium light in body and yields some pleasant flavors, including a hoppy grapefruit sweetness and hints of candy spice. A very well balance of spice, sweet and bitterness. Alcohol is buried under the flavor. Very flavorful and a wonderful Grand Cru. Actually, one of the best in recent memory."
"($5.49 / 25.4 oz / 750 ml Brown Champagne Style bottle - corked and caged)"
"A rich aroma of port, rum, and raisin escapes from my glass as pour this brilliantly clear, amber-copper beer. It is topped by a prodigious tan head that is fueled by a highly active carbonation (I am having difficulty getting to the beer in my tulip glass because of the carbonation) There are some soft spicy notes in the aroma, but it is dominated by the fruity, port, rum notes that where mentioned earlier. It smells quite sweet and reminds me of fresh grapes. The taste fulfills the promise that was given in the nose. The beer is sweet, fruity, and has a hint of spice notes. This is a light bodied brew. The alcohol is evident in the finish, though this is in no way distracting. The beer reminds me of fresh sweet succulent grapes. I am not sure why, but it does. This is pretty good, thoug my attraction to this beer dimineshes with time. At first it is awesome, but the taste fades with time a bit; the beer lack staying power."
"Pours a nice puffy head, and calms down to a 1/8 inch foam. Nice orangy dark brown in color. Lovely and smooth mouthfeel. Cloves and nut meg nose. lots of fruit and spice in malty center.Belgian yeast esters and a bit of bubblegum in the finish. Plain and simple this is a well crafted and tasty Belgiain style concoction from Maine."
"To my knowledge, this is my first Maine beer, and it will not be my last, if this is what I have to look forward to. The fruit and spice elements swirl aptly about a mildly sweet malt presence, and the yeast imparts an appealing, mitigating sourness. As balanced and enjoyable as that sounds here in print, it's even better on the palate. The fire was crackling, and a light snow was falling, and with no thought, one leads to another, with the moderate ABV and spice warming me well and good. It seems to me I should be looking to Maine for more than just L.L. Bean and lobster."
"Great looking beer with small tight bubbles, Belgian lace and a glowing orange/amber color. Rich, tart, subtly sweet and a nice clove undertone. This is a well made Belgian style beer with the right balance of sugar, malt, crisp clean hop flavors with a well hidden alcohol kick. It warms great making this a solid product  bought it at Bevmo in Albany."

"Allagash Grand Cru batch no. 7, Appearance: Cloudy orange amber brown tone with a nice sized tan caramel colored head leaves behind belgian style lacing in specks spread randomly. Aroma: Christmas is in the air piney hops rich but soft malts coat the senses this is one great smelling beer almost like a pine air freshener but in a good way, just too good. Taste: A wave of piney spiced flavor bringing the pale malts out in the sweetness excellent candy like tasting brew puts an instant smile on your face. Mouthfeel: Medium bodied fluffy carbonatin very nice feeling . Drinkability: Very nice easy as all hell to put down simply amazing Christmas ale I have had this on tap but this is by far one of the best beers I have tasted this holiday season."
"It's a bit too carbonated, and darker than some other BSPA's but the complexity of the spice make this a recommended beer for mulling over the taste."
"Update  Its been a little over three years since I last had this beer to thought Id take another stab at it. The nose shows much more spicing than indicated in my original review and its not as sweet as I remember it, but other than that it seems fairly consistent. A fine brew all around!."
"Pours copper with golden colors, medium head that dies quickly very little lace. Aroma of raisins, prunes, licorice, candy sugar, little coriander, some yeast and orange peel. Taste is malt front with a yeasty and spicy middle (coriander) a light sweetness on the finish. Very subtle and complex tastes that make you pay attention. Lively mouthfeel and warming glow upon finish. Little heavy-handed to be highly drinkable but very good"
"Drinkability: Very drinkable. Light yet rich and warming."
"Color is a spicy looking red heud orange with a glob of a white head. Aroma truly is explosive (as a past BA reported) and numerous fruit and floral notes bombard the senses. Flavors match the tastes. If you smell, you taste it. Its all there--the general spicy flavors mixed with the fruity ones. Might I add that its damn quenching too."
"This is a re-review, a year and a couple days after my first scribblings, which I now refute. And perhaps the aging of this sample, from Batch #5, did something to enhance it's overpowering appeal."
"Unfortunately, I don't have as sophisticated (or prominent) taste buds like many of my fellow B.A.'s, so I can't claim to have tasted the wealth of different flavors that others have. What I will say is, if you like Allagash, you'll like this. Kind of a dark version of their triple. The taste is somewhat similar, with some spice and sweetness added. (Nowhere near as spicy as the Anchor Christmas, however). Easy to drink, warming, and crisp. Not overly sweet, and I did not notice the ABV in the taste (but I did in the effect!). An excellent all-around beer, serves as a real nice seasonal. I have yet to have an Allagash that I didn't enjoy a great deal."
"This was a little thicker than some other Grand Cru's but the malt was not overbearing like some others. A slight crispness was also detected on the tongue. The spices ride the tongue long into the finish. This is one of the best Grand Cru's I have ever experienced."
"This offering from Allagash is truly a fantastic beer, very easy to drink. I'll definitely have to locate and sample Allagash's dubbel and triple after this treat."
"A nice Belgian-style beer. Not too sweet, not too dry, but a good amount of sweetness to make this quite an interesting little brew. Quite good, and I'll certainly be awaiting the next release."
"A very well put together beer. I hope to see this in the top 50 someday."
"Tasty stuff here. Orangepeel, a hint of apple, nutmeg, cloves, cinnamon, nicely blend with an excellent malt/hops balance. Dry finish leaves a crisp, spicy aftertaste. Excellent drinkability, and a very well concocted seasonal brew. Alcohol is well disguised by the spices and aromatics, but this one leaves a warm, spicy feeling behind. Very well done."
"750 ml bottle; corked and caged. Batch # 5. Even a careful pour delivers a slightly hazy, copper colored body with bronze and gold highlights. It's full and foamy head of off-white froth wants to leap out of the glass initially, but eventually settles to a creamy 1/2"" lid that holds throughout the goblet and leaves excellent lace. The nose is floral with some light citrus; a yeasty spiciness; a touch of mustiness from the cork; and a candyish, honey-like and gently caramelish malt. It's medium bodied, but light and crisp in the mouth due to its very fine, natural, and lightly effervescent carbonation. The flavor is richer than the aroma indicates with a sweet, softly caramelish malt that's accented by yeasty clove and subtle, dried fruit. Notes of white pepper and spice appear mid-palate, (the small bottles are much spicier) probably due to its alchol. The hop bitterness is restrained, allowing the spiciness to balance it; and it finishes with a note of sweet, candyish malt that displays a slight touch of caramelization. This is a really enjoyable, softly malty and not overly-sweet beer that can be sipped slowly or enjoyed with a meal; but the smaller bottles tend to be a bit more abrasive with increased pepperiness and alcohol to them. Regardless, it's a very nice beer in either form."
"Note: I believe this bottle sat for about 1 year since I bought it."
"i generally shy away from ""spiced"" beers, but i loved this one. perfect for a cold, snowy boston night."
"The color is a slightly cloudy amber. The head looks like a milkshake nice and thick and leaves a decent lace. A citrus lemon peel aroma rises from the glass. The taste is full of spices and herbs. It is almost like eating food, like sausage or meat pie. Good even finish. Definitely a beer to drink slowly and savor."
"a must-try beer. one of the best belgian-styled beers i've ever had."
"This is a tremendous holiday beer. One of my new favorites."
"As usual, I'm very impressed with Allagash on this one."
"Hazy, glden orange color with a thick light-tan colored head that last for a bit. Aromas of blood orange rind, malt, and a mixture of light spices, I picked up on the obvious of some of them; coriander. Malty sweet with smooth spices rounding out a quality Grand Cru replication. Nicely effervescent and drinkable (to the extent that one likes spiced beers.)."
"Happy thanksgiving indeed!"
"A deep orange with a thin white head in an Allagash wide tulip glass. Very clear. (is it keg conditioned?) Nothing really leaps out in the aroma, just a myriad of subtleties. Orange peel, clove, some lightly toasted malts. Flavor is a similar balance of many things, nothing overpowering. A small amount of toffee flavor is snuck in there. Feel and drinkability are absolutely perfect - smooth and very slightly creamy, with small bubbles that caress your mouth. This is a polished beer, a real work of art that forgoes the trend of extreme flavors in favor of a complex mix of subtle ones."
"A twist off brown bottle. Fresh clean hop yeasty sweet bread nose. Hazy cloudy dark golden color with a beautiful thick dense white head. Malty rich corriander spice taste with a touch of cinnamon and walnut in the finish. Smooth rich dense mouth. The toung is lift stinging with spice and malt. There is also a layer of grassy peat hop flavor that comes out more as the beer warms. A wonderfully complex treat. Before you know it, it is gone. A comfort beer... nice!"
"Cloudy, coppery, almost cidery in appearance. Head left quickly, but minimal residue remained that presented bubble of different sizes. Aroma was an excellent spicy, appley, malty combination that was excellent. Taste was equally a balance of spice, malt and some fruitiness. Smooth for a high abv, with a nice dry feeling on the palate with a pleasant bitterness in the aftertaste. Nicely drinkable for the high alcohol content."
"Overall - I really liked this beer. Excellent mixture of fruits, malts and spice and extremely drinkable."
"Really nice beer,pours a deep murky burnt orange with alight head,aroma irony and clovey with light orange essence.Flavor is of 10x sugar and some nuttiness with a real nice orange liquore flavor.A nice late night sipping beer as good as some of the Belgians in my opinion."
"This is a damn good brew for winter. Not as good as on draft but still outstanding. This has quickly become one of my favorites."
"Miles better than their Double offering. This has hints in the flavor that are comparable with the Double, but it seems like they got it right with this one. Huge white head, Deep golden/burgundy color, Taste is complex. Dark fruit, Belgian yeast, pine, and actually, pretty hoppy which is an interesting twist. Mouthfeel is good, (very carbonated), but I wouldn't really want to drink more than one of these in a sitting, and it's definitely something I'd need to be in the mood for."
"Notes: Damn, I'm sorry drank this -- now I'm just pissed I can't get this regularly; seven thumbs up."
"Deep golden-orange color that's absolutely beautiful. Steady stream of carbonation present under natural light with an ample, retaining cream hued head. Nose is spicy with additional notes of sweetness including marshmallow and caramel. Sweet malt, green raisins and cinnamon also make their presence known. Nose, however, is somewhat restrained overall. Taste is an onslaught of a variety of flavors. At first, dark fruit, allspice, cinnamon, tangy citrus, yeast and malt are all prevalent with a mild hop bitterness present on the finish. A mild alcoholic bite also appears, but the alcohol content is well-masked overall. Mouthfeel is smooth, creamy and quite elegant overall. This is certainly a sipping delight, and quite easy drinking at that. This beer is quite age-worthy, as some time in the cellar would help to incorporate its complexities even further. Allagash does a wonderful job crafting Belgian-style brews."
"I know this may sound funny, but the first thing I thought of when I opened this one, was fresh paint. I don't know why, but I think it smells like fresh paint. Anyways, it's definately a good beer for a cold night. It's got some spices in it that warm you from your stomach upwards. It's a murky amber color with a cream colored head. The head started off strong and went down to a laceing. I could also taste some hints of citrus in it. I like it and it's cheap, so that makes it even better!"
"A big, complex beer. A little too sweet for my tastes, and not quite up to par with an authentic belgian grand cru. A great beer, but something seems to be missing."
"The taste is magnificent. It slowly coats your mouth in a mellow malt bath. Smooth....damn smooth. I didn't get much of the spice that's hyped on the bottle, but I did get some nice citrus. Not a hoppy bite you in the mouth citrus, but a subtle underlayer of pear or something of that affect. A barely detectable hop finish makes this a winner in my book. Highly drinkable over an entire evening."
"Hazy reddish-copper color with a large, well-retained, white head. Aroma is of orange peel and spices. The taste is of apples covered in the very intriguing spices. I'm probably wrong, but the spices I taste are cinnamon, cloves, and coriander. This is without a doubt, a very interesting beer and quite enjoyable."
"Even though it finished # 4 of 4 in a grand tasting, this is still a delicious brew and highly recommended. It is dark amber in color with a nice thick, white head. A spicy aroma of fruit, cinnamon, and yeast. It was medium to full bodied holding a lightly plumy flavor balanced with cinnamon,vanilla,black pepper, and yeast. A nice spicy finish to a smooth brew."
"Well, for my milestone 50th review, I went with the consensus on the forum, and decided to review the Allagash Grand Cru. Batch #4 (Also a blatant attempt to suck up to JohnnyP and bennybrew!) It poured with a dark red/ coppery body, and a fluffy tan head. The aroma was mild, with malt, mild hops, cloves and a hint of coriander. The taste was complex, with malt, raisin, clove, ginger, caramel, burgundy wine, nutmeg, and mayhaps a hint of ginger. All this was overlaid with a mild hoppiness. The mouthfeel was smooth, with a slight oiliness. It finished with hops, grapefruit, and a hint of malty sweetness. Thanks to everyone for their suggestions, this was a beer worthy of milestone status!!!!"
"Overall an amazing find. It really caught me off guard, especially in July. I can deffinatly see sitting around a fire in the winter sipping this beer. A great winter beer one that I'll deffinatly be on the lookout for during the holiday season."
"Wow. Each sip was so dramatically different with this beer. Impressively complex. Amber in the truist hardened-sap form. Rocky head looks like the surface of the moon. Varied aromas all hover around a fruity theme -- estery, orange spicy, citrusy, peachy. As it warms a bit more, the peachy/tropical fruits come out a bit more. A little gummy in the nose. A surprisingly dry, phenolic taste that encompasses so much of the flavor. Briefly sweet and almost smokey in its dryness. A distinct movement into a peppery alcohol phase. I think I could have used a little more alcohol and candy-ish sweetness in this beer; the phenolic variety (e.g., a little plastic, a little smoke) was just a bit awkward. Still a good one."
"F"
"Orange peel amd canola oil coupled with a medicinal flavour, a bit band-aidy aswell as having the sweet start, but a relatively dry finish, with some pepper. A bit ""surgical"" (thanks Fil for that analysis). Still, another very flavourful beer, relatively soft mouthfeel, with some late sharpness."
"This Allagash kicks ass!"
"Large bottle from Batch 5. Light amber color. Large foamy head. Aroma is malt, figs and caramel. Medium bodied Belgian Ale. Malts are bready and slightly sweet. Hops are floral and a touch citrusy. Well balanced. Typical Belgian spices, clove and coriander with a touch of nutmeg, ginger, brown sugar and oranges. A very tasty beer. Mouthfeel is full and round, Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly sweet."
"Ruby-orange color with a thick, rocky, creamy tan head. The aroma is fruity, herbal, with a bit of malt. The flavor is malty, and herbal, with a fruity, spicy hop bitterness. It is full in body with a drying finish. A pretty smooth beer for its strength."
"This beer is a quite clear copper in color with a minimal, off-white head. The majority of the yeast remained in the bottle. Smells malty with definite hints of various spices. Flavor is sweet, malty, and spiced - coriander, pepper, citrus flavor. Not too hoppy in general and I certainly do not notice the alcohol while drinking."
"Overall Grand Cru is a joy to drink. It has a refreshing quality about it that makes it an anytime anyplace beer. The complexity of its flavors and aroma make it fit with formal dinners or just sitting around the yard. Another product from Allagash that leaves you with a smile."
"Great brew and a benchmark Grand Cru IMHO."
"Deep, clear red. Heavy carbonation builds strong, lasting head. Not sure what the dominant spice here is but it's something they use in Sweetwater Festive Ale. Maple, molasses is a bit heavy. The strong carbonation makes for cottony mouthfeel I dislike. It gets a little too sweet as it warms, so this may be a better beer at a little cooler than cellar temp. The sweetness and the mouthfeel hurt drinkability a bit."
"Batch #5 750mm Bottle. Great appearance as with all of Alagash's ales. Classic large frothy head atop a slightly cloudy golden body. Outstanding flavor and smooth on the palate. Slightly spicy with notes of fruit and a sweet alcohol sensation. Overall great ale and an absolute pleasure."
"What else could it be for #250 but a tribute to the two greatest brewing countries on earth  an American interpretation of a Belgian style. Id heard good things about Allagash, but this was the first beer of theirs Id had the chance to try. Lovely 750ml bottle with a wire-wrapped cork that explodes with the pent-up carbonation. The beer itself is a hazy amber, with a moderately sized, fairly creamy head. Ah, that Grand Cru aroma. Toasty malt, some nice cinnamon and coriander spices, yeast, and some very mild fruit. The beer is decadently creamy in the mouth, very smooth. Flavor starts of candi-sugar sweet, with the toasted malts developing mid-palate along with something like passionfruit. More cinnamon and nutmeg spiciness toward the end, enough so to make up for the lack of much in the way of noticeable hops. The beer leaves an aftertaste which is very husky and surprisingly pleasant. Seamlessly blended and very tasty."
"It pours out, heavily carbonated, a thin white head atop ruby amber liquid. Smells of dried herbs, spices, alcohol, and cherries. Flavors of dark fruits, yeast, bread are present, with a mild hop bite and a touch of alcohol in the finish. A very tasty ale indeed, though I wanted a fuller mouthfeel. It seemed a tad thin, but that was its only downfall. Another great beer from Allagash."
"The watery aspect to the sour made it slightly refreshing and very inviting. Dry finish from the hops and the sour begged me back, though it could be lighter and have more of a malt and spice presence in taste. Slightly active mouthfeel left a thin and clean watery feel on the tip of the tongue. Overall, damn tasty, like christmas sugar and spice, clear w/o yeast more earthy w/ yeast  good both ways. Easily a wintertime favorite in the New England."
"This big old bad boy pours an unclouded mahogany with a head that is Titanic in size, creamy in texture, light tan in color as it dissipates the resultant lace a silky covering upon the glass. Do I detect yeast, yes I do, caramel, sweet, fresh and clean, maybe a bit plummish, and even a nice hop floral aroma, a complex nose to be sure. Front is sweet, malt laden and the top middling in the feel to the palate; finish has a distinct hop spiciness, the acidity delectable and the aftertaste quite dry and long lasting, another keeper from this most spectacular brewery."
"Great example of a winter ale. Pours a hazy amber/orange color with a thin light beige head. Thin but very sticky lacing. Welcoming aroma of spices and malt. Medium-bodied, not to spicy and not too sweet. Flavors of cinnamon, nutmeg, malt and caramel lingering around. Finish is lightly hopped and a little fruity (apple and/or apricot, it was hard to pinpoint). I liked this easy-drinking seasonal."
"Pours a hazy medium amber, with a large, big-bubbled, white head, mostly diminishes to leave some good lacing. Aroma is yeasty and spicy (clove, nutmeg, cinnamon). Flavor starts slightly fruity sweet, turns to the spices in the middle, and ends with a peppery spiciness and pretty dry. Medium body, dry ending, very lively carbonation."
"P.S. I need to go to confession after reading the LongBeachBum's review. Wow !"
"And I fancy having her again. Well, in a few minutes anyway."
"Poured a cloudy, amber color. The head was thick and lasting. The nose was great. Losts of fruity and spicey notes. A nutty, spicey taste contols this beer. The spices are a little overwhelming and give this beer a bizarre taste. The mouthfeel is just plain awkward. As far as drinkability goes, its not great but strong enough to have another."
"Pours a deep amber/mahogany color with a thick creamy froth that hangs around until the last drop is gone. It leaves a beautiful lace on the glass, which seems to hang on for dear life. Wonderful aromas of sweet citrus fruit and spicy clove erupt from the glass. At first taste, a zip of spicy clove attacks my taste buds, quickly followed by raid of malt, citrus, and hops, finally finished by the sweet mellowness of honey and licorice. This is such a well-balanced and great tasting brew. This beer is yet another exceptional product from the Allagash Company."
"Very, very, exceptional stuff, recommendation is high."
"pat"
"The label said ""made with spices"" but the spices were not overpowering. Poured a nice amber hue with good carbonation. Although it had a ""light"" ABV of 7.2, it did give me a nice glow as I drank the bottle. Great balance of hops, not gamey. An excellent beer."
"This is a fine brew. A medium off-white head faded to a thin foamy lace which only served to highlight the slightly clouded reddish-amber color. It has a muted fruity smell with a hint of maple, but the high alcohol content (7.8%) is neverthless distinct. The first drink was a delightful experience as the texture of this spicy ale was thicker than I expected with almost a buttery smoothness and just a hint of carbonation The taste is consistent; that is, it does not shift much from first blush to aftertaste, and there is a strong woodsy overtone. Loved it. Hats off to another exciting ale from my home state of Maine!"
"Thanks Venom!"
"This beer poured a dark amber color and formed a medium bubbly white lace that left latticed lace as it subsided. A small amount of carbonation was present. An aroma of malt and floral elements were present. A flavor of malt and caramel was present. The finish was a touch astrigent yet buttery, which was different."
"This is the second brew I have had from Allagash, and I think this brewery is doing it right. Something about the beers just make me feel that they are fresh. The Grand Cru was a deep copper beer with a creamy medium-thick head. The smell was of fruit, yeast and honey and the taste was not too far afield which the same flavors represented. There were some currant hints which left a port-like aftertaste as well. The taste was just ""smooth"". Very drinkable and interesting brew."
"Pours deep copper in color with a huge creamy and pillowy white head that eventually fades into a nice thick and heavy lace. Nose is fruity with notes of clove, allspice, and fresh citrus. Nice crisp mouth feel with lots of carbonation. Taste is spicy up front with flavors of clove and allspice blended with some candied fruit. Middle is more of a malty yeastiness with some raisin notes. Finish is dry with a kick of spicy pepper. No hop bitterness is present. Any fan of Belgian-style ales will surely love this brew. A very big thanks to paceyourself for sending me this brew!"
"This beer deserves to be in the top 50 hands down. It was a wonderful buy! The pour was rich with a white head and a beautiful foggy, dark, amber body. The only complaint I had was with the smell which revealed the increased alcohol conten. However, there was also a good spicy/fruity smell, which was very pleasing to the nose. The taste was great with some serious hops and fruits and subtle notes of honey and maple. It left a great, bitter taste in the back of my throat. Even though I had even warmed it up a bit it still felt like I was drinking water straight from the top of Khatadin. It was incredible!"
"Belgian with a Down-East flair. I love it! Seriously, this is my first Allagash, and seriously, these guys are serious about their brews, and I respect them immensely for it. It's a great looking beer, deep copper-orange with a persistent white head that gives to that typical Belgian lace as you empty the glass. There's an in-your-face aspect to the taste that is a bit less subtle than other examples of this style. Is it a hint of grapefruity hoppiness? I don't know, but it's grown on me over the course of this six-pack. Definitely a bready quality to the taste, with hints of spice (a bit of coriander and clove), a little pepper, and some molasses. I can imagine Bert and I speaking a Down-East version of Flemish over this one."
"Cheers"
"Big ups to the Notorious B.I.G.H.U.G.E."
"Pours slightly hazed amber orange with a 2 finger off-white head that sticks around. A whiff reveals very nice fruit and spices with light yeast. Smells very nice! The taste consists of more spices that are very pronounced and also has a fruity, yeasty, and light alcohol flavors that taper into a slightly dry tail. Again, very nice! A highly complex Belgian Style Ale that is light to medium bodied and it leaves you wanting more. Wonderful! Thanks again Beerluvr for this experience! Cheers!"
"750ML corked and caged. Batch #5. Pours a copper, mahogany color with abig creamy head and ample lacing. Head falls to a 1/4 inch then holds. Aroma of spices, light fruits, citrus. First taste reveals a light grapefruit, sweet malty flavor. Creamy mouthfeel, with just the right carbonation. Crisp, dry finish, light hops. Very nice. Worth a try."
"Batch #4. Dark bronze hue, w/ a light haze. Moderate, persistent off white head leaves sparse lace. Sweet orange peel, w/ floral notes of lavender honey and rosemary in aroma. Caramel malt becomes more pronounced as the beer warms & breathes. Mild banana esters and toasted malt. Flavorwise, clove laced sweetness persists throughout. Caramel malt is more pronounced that the ""norm", adding a richness to the flavor profile. Malt sweetness combines w/ clove and peppery alcohol to from a black licorice mid palate impression. Spices seem to have mellowed somewhat, w/ light herbal notes of citrus peel and perhaps coriander perceptible. Fruitiness is mild, but distincitively date like in nature. Subdued banana esters as well. Becomes progressively more vinous and sherryish in underlying flavor as it breathes. Moderate bodied, yet crisp and light on the palate. Low hop bitterness leaves residual sweetness unhindered. Finishes full circle, w/ fading clove and malt sweetness. Allegash Grand Cru is a unique & delicious brew. It's reminescent of a Wit / dubbel hybrid-- almost the best of both worlds."
"After awhile the head is still going strong and leaves a beautiful lace. If I had known how good this ale was I wouldn't have let it sit for so long. I think that I have one more different Allagash left and I think that I will have to sample."
"Medium bodied. A nice malty flavor, balanced though. Sweetness is great for those who like this style. Higher alcohol is very deceptive to me. For an alternative to pricey Belgian imports, give this one a try."
"Ochre-brown color, hazy with a fairly small head that laces little but with intricate detail. Spicy aroa, clove and nutmeg, somewhat wheaty and grainy. Flavor follows smell, with estery elements and an added sense of orange and other sweetened fruit, almost a pineapple property. Nice mouthfeel, semi-lush because of low carbonation. Slight alcohol and rind at the finish. This beer gets better as it warms a bit, a nice big and bad one for Winter. Good entry for Allagash, I prefer it over the Dubbel Reserve -- with other examples to come."
"I'd love to try this side by side with the Allagash White to try and decipher the differences."
"Nice frothy head didn't hang around for to long, light tan color. You can smell the fruit mixed with the spices very appetizing. Good body not to thick a nice orange/amber color. It has a nice fruit taste that is raging with spices. nice hints of alcohol that gives a really good warming effect in the end. Goes down nice and easy for it's high alcohol content. Good beer would not recommend having a sixer of this one it's a good night cap!"
"Drinkability: Quite high considering it's almost 8%abv. This is a great beer to have beside you in front of a roaring fire with a good book. Allagash continues to impress..."
"Clear copper, with a thick bubbly head. Moderate amount of CO2 in the body. Thick clinging lace on the glass. Sweet and malty smell with a healty dose of licorice and other spices. Malty caramel flavor with fruit and spicy notes - again, licorice is most notable. Rather thin body. Dry finish, with a slight lingering fruit taste. Overall, it's a good brew, but it doesn't stand out as particularly special."
"Batch #4... this beer was somewhat cloudy and copper / brown with a thick but quickly disappating head. Aroma of malt, cloves, figs, and vanilla. Flavor was sweet... malt upfront, some dried fruit notes, and vanilla, followed by some spicy bitterness... with a bit of alcohol lingering on the tongue. Body was medium... gave a crisp impression... well carbonated. This is a very solid Belgian dark ale."
"Pours with the look of fall, brownish red and orange.  Nice but modest head that dissipates soon to a thin layer.  Interesting nose infused with the smell of malt, spice and some fruity esters.  Lighter in body than I expected with good carbonation delivering a fairly smooth mouthfeel.  The taste is different and hard for me to decribe.  Malt and spice are present, with some bitter orange peel and fruity, herbal tea flavors.  Bitterness is perceived not only in the very beginning but in the finish as well.  Like I said, interesting.  Give it a try.  BTW, I believe the alcohol content to be 7.2% this year."

"Great flavor with good amount of malt sweetness, spicy cloves and some orange fruitiness with a little yeastiness. Zippy mouthfeel with a good bit of carbonation, yet has a kind of creaminess after the initial bubbly sting. Warming alcohol noticeable after a few sips, this is another gret Belgian from Allagash. I'll be saving a few of these while they are available to try later and see how they age."
"Notes: This one gets quite dry the longer it ages and the alcohol seems to mellow out a bit also which makes for a perfect summer time brew even though this is a winter seasonal. Next time it comes around or if you see it on the shelf buy a few and cellar them for a few or several months."
"Batch # 2 BTW. I waited a long time for this one, poured with a healthy rocky head, effervescent and long lasting. Beautiful slightly hazy red in the glass. Nose is yeasty and fruity, taste is a little medicinal (in a good way) with typical Belgian fruit and malt notes throughout, with a hint of acidity. Goes down very easy...it's amazing that I held onto it since first bringing it home back in December! IMO, Allagash is the best Belgian-style brewery in the Northeast, along with Brewery Ommegang."
"Huge sustained off tan head.  Hazy bropwn color.  Spicy, lemon zest nose, mixed with hints of cinnamon and nutmeg.  Slightly medicinal nose.  Some hints of sweet candi sugar. Distinct belgian yeast aftertaste, almost biscuity at times.  For a beer this big, the alcohol and its warming powers are very subtle."
"A wonderful New England seasonal, maturity seems to have done this beer nothing but good. The epitome of balance: mellow yet robust, peppery yet velvety. Fruity and tantalizingly sweet with subdued hop character. The spices seem at one with the brew. Alcohol notes are present but do not mask the flavor. This beer has a raw cidery quality (I mean real dark cider, not the light fizzy stuff) that is so appropriate for fall/winter months. Matured nicely into the early spring months, curious to drink it again a few months down the road."
"I detected perhaps a bit of orange zest, caramel, clove and banana. Complex and tasty to say the least. A nice weekday evening after dinner brew."
