I gave it sorta middling scores, I didn't particularly enjoy it though I liked most aspects of it (none of that probably makes any sense).

Abbaye des Rocs' Grand Cru Belgian Special Brown Ale is an excellent strong dark ale, and in my opinion it's a total steal at its LCBO price point ($3.00/bottle). I don't profess to be an expert as far as BJCP style guidelines go, but from a personal subjective standpoint, I am looking for four things from these types of beers - bold, complex malty flavours; lots of fruity, Belgian yeast esters/spice character; a full body; and well-integrated alcohol. This isn't the most complex Belgian ale I've ever had, but it still tastes great and is balanced beautifully. Highly recommended to any fan of Belgian sippers.","thehyperduck","0"

Fruit continuing into the finish alongside a very subtle bitter note. Banana burps. Medium-bodied with light, soft carbonation. Feels smooth and deceptively light for its weight, if that makes sense.

Pours very cloudy deep ruby red color with a 1-2 finger foamy cream colored head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with plenty of carbonation streaming up retaining the head. Aromas of big raisin, fig, apple, pear, prune, fig, caramel, molasses, toast, toffee, dark bread, light chocolate, clove, pepper, and earthy yeast esters Fantastic aromas with great balance and complexity of fruity/spicy esters and malty notes. Taste of raisin, apple, pear, prune, fig, caramel, toast, molasses, toffee, pepper, dark bread, light chocolate, clove, and earthy yeast esters. Lingering notes of light and dark fruits, caramel, pepper, molasses, toast, toffee, dark bread, floral, light chocolate, clove, and earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Fantastic balance and complexity of fruity, peppery, and dark malt flavors; with zero cloying sweetness present on the finish. Medium-high carbonation and fairly full bodied; with a creamy, fairly slick, and lightly prickly mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Very smooth to sip on for 9.5%. Overall this is an absolutely incredible Belgian strong dark ale! Big complexity and balance and fruity, malty, and spicy flavors; and extremely smooth to sip on the for the strength. An extremely delicious offering.","superspak","Feb 16, 2013"

There isn't too much lacing but enough to satisfy. The nose is full of dark fruits and candy sugars, with hints of spice. Figs, raisins, brown sugar, nutmeg and Belgian yeast make up and excellent and complex nose. I'm surprised alcohol doesn't come into play. It's completely hidden. There is an immediate candy sweetness in the taste, but not a cloying sweetness. Sweet figs take center stage here only this time the alcohol comes through just barely. The mouth feel is on par with the rest of the beer. It's full bodied, soft and with moderate carbonation. Some of the yeast particle can be felt on the tongue as the beer finishes from the glass. As far as Belgian Strong Dark Ales go this one is above par. The taste, smell, feel and appearance are second to none. Highly recommended to any Belgian lover.

The sour apple, pear, plum, brown sugar, chocolate malt, and fig flavors are very pleasant.

Still, the enhance the flavor and make it subtly more complex. After letting the cold temperature come down a little, I can pick up a more distinct raisin as the beer touches my palate, dark chocolate, and the pear/sour apple fruit flavors are soft and in the finish, along with a little spice.

Mouthfeel is more of the same and covers all the bases. Sticky, sweet, smooth, creamy, has a bit of dry backbite thanks to some hop bitterness and spice. The taste is comprised of sweet malts like caramel and cocoa, maybe some roasted, and also has some heavy fruits like orange in there along with some yeast, figs and a hint of spice like clove.

Otherwise, the appearance is a hazy ruby-brown with a short tan head. The aroma and flavor are heavy with sweet grape, maple syrup, and dates with mild dark chocolate in the background. The body is a touch thick, normal for the ABV, and dries out toward the finish, making it deliciously drinkable. Still, because of the sweet lean of this beer, I'd save it for an after-dinner beer.

It is mind bendingly complex, almost teasing you with hints of something here and then hints of something there, almost daring you to try and come up with an idea of what it is you are tasting. But this has the adverse effect of having everything sort of blend together if you let it happen, and if you do this beer becomes rather bland, muddled and listless, where you almost forget what you are drinking.

I'm picking up a very fruity nose, a bit of banana and spices. No doubt the yeast strain contribute a lot of the characteristics. This is a very rich beer to the palate, similar to other Belgiums. I can taste a bit of belgium sugar candy, hints of plum and raison with a slight hop bitter finish. A bit thinner mouth feel then I would expect but not thin by any means.

After popping the cap, I got some overflow, not quite an explosion, but enough to spill down the sides. After letting it settle down a bit, I poured myself some into a Belgian chalice. Wow, there were a lot of chunks of yeast. Too many, almost to the point of distraction. I let the glass sit for a bit, and upon first taste, I liked it. The taste was of caramel and fruit, with a smoothness that hid the alcohol level. But those chunks, they are hard to ignore. For the second glass, I poured extremely slow, and most of the yeast stayed in the bottle. This was an enjoyable beer now. But the third and final glass was 1/3 yeast chunks, so not so great.

The flavor is more dark fruits, sweet and malty, with a delicious complexity. The low score on mouthfeel is from the chunks that really ruin it for me. They're very unpleasant and ruin an otherwise very good beer.

A soft, whipped foamy light tan head sticks to the surface for a while before eventually fading away. Dark, tart, fruity aroma resembles apple cider, cherries, and sweet, sticky bread. The slick, creamy mouthfeel is low on carbonation after the explosive beginning but still very nice in its full body and mild warmth.

The finish dries it out nicely and gives it a great balance. The alcohol follows the liquid down & gives you that glow that says the beer loves you. Really. I promise. The finish is bitter after a few sips but once the alcohol kicks in you really don't mind so much. The mouthfeel has great carbonation held in check by a silkiness that's just sexy.

Anyway, each bottle I have has been infected. I'm assuming so since the huge foaming head occurs each time. The taste seems ok, but I'm not sure about the no carbonation mouthfeel. Something is fishy here. I will have to revisit this beer for sure to get an accurate reading. As is, it has good texture and pretty good flavor.

Savory spice, beet sugar sweetness, and dusty yeast aromas compose the nose. On the palate, big carbonation first off, then nutty sweetness and a touch of fruity acidity. For a big, rich, beer this has a surprisingly light touch -- the yeast has left over plenty of fruity esters and, along with some bubblegum flavors and big carbonation, this makes for a light touch. On the bottom end, the palate has plenty of malty, dark candi sugar sweetness, along with some earthy, tobacco-like notes. Mouthfeel is pretty heavy, but lightened somewhat by present alcohol and big carbonation. Overall, this is a very good Belgian strong dark ale. Lots of sweet notes, good carbonation level, a bit heavy in mouthfeel, but all this is counterbalanced by light yeasty and fruity notes. Quite good.","geexploitation","Beers"

Winter holiday flavors - especially spiciness - are unmistakable, and extrememly tasty. The fizz starts fine, then quickly aggregates, creating a pleasant airiness if you hold it for a while before swallowing.

Lots of old malt smells. Dried dark fruits, brown sugar, yeasty and earthy. Big malt flavors up front again with dried dark fruits. A bit of an ""off"" flavor but I am not quite sure what it is.

A murky, reddish mahogany colored beer with a thin sandy ring inhabits the oversized wine goblet into which it was poured. I tried to avoid pouring the thick protein globules I could see floating in the bottom of the bottle, but they all started glugging out the mouth of the bottle, even with a slow pour, so I just said, ""fuck it," and emptied the thing into my glass. Long story short: there's a ton of floating protein-yeast chunks in the glass. ""Good," I guess? Anyway, aromas of cherry soda and prune juice predominate; a slight yeast scent and a scant vapor of alcohol show themselves as well. Cherry-prune juice blend with caramelized sugar added as an additional sweetener! Aftertaste of Bing cherry skins. Alcohol is mildly detectable in the taste, but the flavor profile is so big that it's most noticeable as a buzzy numbness on the tongue afterwards. Near the end, a characteristically ""Belgian"" yeasted flavor comes in as well. Mouthfeel is thick: syrupy with expansive carbonation that lightens it up a bit. Still pretty full-bodied, though, and not because of any slimy floaters! Although sweet beers are usually less drinkable on my scale, this one has enough funky Belgian yeast character to keep it extremely interesting. ""Best Before End of 2008.""

Dark fruits, spices, yeasty and somewhat malty, with a nice slight warmth obviously due to the alcohol, but not too much flavor due to it.

The taste is only a little sweet, with a serious meaty yeastiness. Stingingly high carbonation.

Smells fruity and alcoholic, with rum raisin and a vague spiciness that eventually comes closest to cinnamon. Nosefeel is clean, penetrating, and liqueurish. After an initial flavor of brown sugar, the taste becomes like drinking a fruitcake... dank, rum-soaked fruitcake laden with candied fruit and pecans. Apple butter rounds out the finish and burps of dried pineapple soon follow. Alcohol is very notably warm without being at all harsh in the mouthfeel, leading to a smooth, dry finish.

Some cherries and molasses too. Flavor does not cling to my taste buds either but allowed me to enjoy my meal in and of itself as I ate.

There is also a mild spiciness in the taste, and a very intriguing bubble gummy flavor, which I think is the best feature of this beer.

Do yourself a favor, dont try to get the cork out of this one without the proper implement, its a rugged one. When poured out into my La Trappe goblet the body of this beer is ruby brown and hazy, topped with a meringue like head of off-white foam. Flecks of sediment can be seen sinking to the bottom. This is one delicious smelling beer, lot of vinous notes with hints of brandy soaked fruit. Sweet malt, toffee, and spicy, musty, delicious yeast. The flavor is candy sweet without being cloying. There is a pear-like fruitiness across the front of my palate, combined with suprising sweet coffee like notes. Then that flavor that I often Belgian Strong Darks that I refer to as dates rolled in attic dust, I love it really. The finish is musty, nutty and delicious, with a robust spicy alcohol punch.

4.54,7.8,4,5,4.5,4,4.5,"Brown in hue with noticeable tawny influences, when held to a light a lovely ruby tint develops. At this point I could notice some suspended yeast sediment in the dense liquid. The head was beige in color, frothy, at the apex of the foam reached almost two fingers in height. Head retention was decent, after a few moments it faded to a modest cap. This cap lasted the entire consumption, impressive. However, subsequent lacing wasnt that impressive, there were a few patches and that was about all. Still the appearance is excellent. Eye-candy. Sometimes the potency of the nose in big beers is disappointing to me, it is never as lively as I like. Very few Belgian beers have lived up to my expectations when it comes to pure potency of the bouquet. I am very pleasant to say, the power of the smells of this ale is second to none! Wow! The nose has strong malty aromas. Not only is the malt deep, it is very wide with so many layers! At no time does the malt standalone. The sweet chocolate is infused with cinnamon and orange. Sugar cookies. Coffee cakes soaked in OSA, you pick the vintage. Yeasty. Lemony at the back with a trace of mustiness. To say this nose is inviting is an understatement. I dont take sips of the beer until Im done writing about the nose. I seriously had to force the glass away from my mouth. But finally, Im done writing and I can take a drink. Allow me to pause The palate is very, very good. I thought Abbaye Des Rocs was fantastic. While Im not going to compare the two, I will say the palate of the Grand Cru is not as impressive. With that said, the palate is surprisingly spicy. Cinnamon, ginger, coriander, peppery qualities too that play devilishly well with the fruitiness. Melons, grapes, figs, and dates laced with brandy, dusted with brown sugar. There is a doughiness that reminds me of OSA bread I made once. Oranges stand alone from the other fruit as it comes off with a liqueur quality to it. The malt is not as deep as the nose lead on, I am disappointed about that; yes, I like the sweetness of the chocolate but I need more than that. Sure the maltiness is nothing to complain about, beside that I find it a tickle shallow. Since the rest of this beer is near perfection whining about the malt seems to be nitpicking. Maybe it is. But I did anyway. The aftertaste is modestly hot; this is the only point of the beer that the alcohol seems noticeable. But no way does it come across at 10% abv. Otherwise the aftertaste is a mix of fruit and spice. Very nice, it reminds me of alcoholic marmalade. Is it complex? Yes but it could be more multifaceted. Would I drink this again? Hell yes! But seriously, more malt backbone is needed. Medium in body, fizzy carbonation that plays perfectly with the spice and fruit; I am very impressed, however, it is too thin. The mouthfeel has fizz but no pizzazz. I really enjoyed this beer. It is great. I understand why this beer is in the BA Top 15. Amazingly tasty and equally as drinkable but, me personally, give me the regular Abbaye Des Rocs! I purchased a bottle in Burnsville, MN for $8.40. Recommended.","bditty187","Oct 01, 2004"

The smell was sweet with a slight spice to it as well as strong fruit notes. The taste started off with a fruity caramel sweetness that mingled with a bit of spice and yeast flavors. Not overly sweet but just right, the aftertaste is a bit tart as well. Very good taste with a lot of things going on that I will have to have this again to pick up on more of them. This almost has a full body but just falls short not that it hurts it in any way, and its very rich and creamy on the tongue.

4.85,15.2,4.5,4.5,5,5,5,"Carefully poured from a long-standing bottle its body is a brilliant dark ruby/chestnut beneath a creamy cap of off-white (almost tan) foam. The head retention is quite good, and it leaves splashes of lace about the glass. The nose combines a sweetish, caramel-dripped and subtly buttery biscuit-like maltiness with some fairly bold fruitiness (flashes of orange, raspberries, cherry, and a waft of lime). It's airy in the mouth with a combination of dextrinous mouthfeel and CO2 breakout that billows up softly and then fades away with just a light zest on the palate. A richer maltiness and some exceptionally nice, delicately spicy alcohol appear in the flavor; as well as some floral hop notes and wider range of fruitiness (papaya, cocoanut and pineapple perhaps?, and some green apple). It's much more balanced (less sweet) than the standard Abbaye Des Rocs; and it offers exceptional drinkability with a certain level of richness and complexity that does not overwhelm the tastebuds but certainly keeps you coming back for more. It finishes dry with some lingering alcohol spice (although the alcohol never hinders!) and maltiness that reminds you of the beautiful flavors you've just savored.

The smell has lots of sweet plum, cherry, and red grape mixed with a subtle but solid alcohol aroma. The taste has lots of malt and sweetness, more of those fruit flavors coming through. The different tastes are very layered, and come together very nice in the finish with just a splash of ethanol. The mouthfeel is thick and strong, yet smooth as silk.

The flavor is medicinal bitterness at the front, followed by a huge spice wave, and brief sweeping sweet dark malt, and a tongue pounding alcohol finish. Whoa. The first sip, everything goes by so quickly, the mouth cannot keep up. Earthy yeast character becomes present in the beginning after the second sip, and a wave of dark fruit takes over the middle of the tongue. Mouthfeel is similar to the Burgundy Ale, very sharp and crisp, bordering astringent. Very carbonated and prickly on the tongue.

Mouthfeel was creamy, but agressivly carbonated with the small bubbles all over the place. Of the grand crus I have tried this one struck me as the most banal.

4.39,4.3,4,5,4.5,4.5,3.5,"Appearance is a murky brown, even more so when pouring the immense amount of yeast into the chalice (which helped a lot to release the subtleties of the awesome aroma). It seems paler than the regular abbaye des rocs. Relatively high apparent carbonation level, huge head with irregular bubbles, but quite spectacular. It slowly fades away, but still sticks to the glass. Aroma is very complex if not too intense. This is ultimate belgian goodness and balance between brown sugar malt sweetness and yeast funkiness. Ultra-complex fruity profile (berries, cherries, plums, pears, apples), very spicy also (sage, parsley, cinnamon cake). That's all great by itself, but what makes the aroma truly unique is how it combines the above flavours with the belgian farmhouse character from the yeast which lends it a unique hay-ish and floral side that I love, almost a Fantome. The taste also contains this good dose of funk and spicy unexplainable weirdness, wet fieldish hay drying under the sun, pepper grains, basil, thyme? full of subtleties and perhaps the apotheosis of a spiced belgian strong dark ales with masterfully hidden alcohol, very sweet, bready and yeasty with a creamy, silky crème caramel medium-full body.

The flavor profile was extremely complex. A rich and lively sweetish malt body contained flavors of dried fruit, raisins, molasses, scotch, and slim jim spice. The finish was satisfying, with a good bitter cap and lingering clove maltiness. The body was very full and silky smooth, with fluffy carbonation.

4.73,12.4,5,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,"Taste is very complex and incerdibly inticing. Whew, what a mouthfull of things going on here. Simply amazing and fine with nothing to overpowering really other then the alcohol hitting fast as it goes down very nicely with a smooth zesty fullness that begins to make your head swoon just after half a glass and there's yet a whole nother serving in that 750ml bottle yet to come, oh boy...a long night ahead. Flavors are quick to enter with sharpening tones of citrus zest from lemon and orange with some light pineapple, white grapes, dulled grapefruit, and sweet mango inscribed within the mix along with small added notes of yeasty spicyness with kinda of a peppery, clove, nutmeg, citrus peel zest thing. Lots of zest! Lots of softened spicyness. And what makes it even more remarkable is there seems to be a very nice dark malty sweetness of toffee/caramel that kinda keeps those spices from getting out of control and too strong. Beautiful medley of flavors that intermingle and dance with each other in perfect harmony. Full bodied feel with a bit of sharpness and yeastyness that takes away just a nudge for me, but not by much. So goes the feel so goes the drinkability, in most cases anyways, and it does with me with this, by just another nudge mainly due to the untraceable alcoholic effect this has and smallish sharp tone of zest and yeast. But damn this is some very good stuff! Thank you very much ManekiNeko!!","tavernjef","0"

A rather fruit driven offering with delicious malt flavors and a very fine velvety texture. This sucker goes down easy and gets tastier as it goes down.

4.45,5.7,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Before I get to the specific review, let me note that Grand Cru is NOT a style. It simply means the best beer from the brewery. The fact that this beer, Rodenbach Grand Cru, and Hoegaarden Grand Cru are all listed in the same category proves how useless the definition is. This beer is more of an strong belgian ale, with a color right on the border between pale and dark. Appearance: Beautiful reddish-orange color. Big, thick, creamy had, with very good retention, and noticeable lace. Aroma: complex spiciness, and a candy-like sweetness. Flavor: sweet, caramel, with a balancing tartness and spiciness. Mouthfeel: creamy, rich, with a nice dryness from the spicing in finish. Drinkability: The delicate balancing act that this beer performs makes it incredibly easy to drink for such a strong beer.","saltydog","Oct 26, 2003"
4.54,7.8,4,5,4.5,4,4.5,"Pours with a thick tannish head. A beautiful deep garnet color with a slight chill haze to it. This beer smells fruity (apricot being the most predominant aroma, followed by orange). There is a certain candy sweet aroma as well, maybe a hint of butterscotch. This beer has an outstanding aroma and I could just sniff it for ages. As I sniff it the head has barely lost its 2 inch thickness, it is well carbonated. There is a bit of maltiness in the aroma as well. It is definitely well carbonated tasting as well. It is lightly sweet, with a fruitiness that was promised in the nose. There is both a candied apricot and orange flavor here. There is also a slight sense of the alcohol in this one. The taste doesn't quite live up to the aroma but this beer still need to warm up a bit. I detect a hint of astringency in the finish, there seems to be some nice Belgian yeast fermentation byproducts here as well. The beer has some slight Belgian lacing in evidence as I slowly work my way to the bottom of the glass. As it warms up the beer becomes softer, though the alcohol is still evident. Becomes sweeter and maltier. the beer color clears up a bit as it warms too, it displays some nice orange hues as it is held up to the light.","Gueuzedude","Oct 23, 2003"

A candy sweet flavor melds with fresh bread, caramel apples, mild lime-like bitterness, light pine, a hint of chocolate, and an ever so faint astringent camphor taste.

Had tons of carbonation so the cream-colored foamy head sat well. Surprisingly, had mediocre lace. Smelled of cherries, oak, and an alcohol scent, but rounded nicely. Taste was oaky from middle through finish, with a nice true cherry flavor up front. Tasted some roast and green flavors at the end  hops, yeast, both?. Left an oily and creamy coating on the tongue. A decent example of the style, but a bit basic and not as fascinating as some others (Allagash, hmmmm....)","nomad","Jun 15, 2003"

A large amount of carbonation and some sediment is present. It has a wonderful aroma of malt, caramel, raisins and other fruit with a touch of pepper. A heavy flavor of malt, caramel, raisins and a warming touch of the alcohol. The finish is of a medium body and slightly sweet and creamy with a warm aspect of the alcohol present.

Spices were coriander, peppers, brown sugar and chocolate. Extremely smooth, very creamy. Hides the 10% alcohol very well. There is a touch of an alcohol bite, but it could just be the peppers.

4.44,5.5,4,5,4.5,4,4,"Amber color with offwhite head -- not nearly as carbonated as I was expecting for some reason. Baskets of ripened plums. Sugary sweet aroma pushes into a sweet palate highlighted by the way roses might taste if one were to eat roses. Something of an herbal tea taste. While more fruity in aroma, very floral in taste -- if that makes sense. I suspect that the semi-sweet finish is derived from some type of hops -- not really bitter but not really sweet. Just delicately balanced. Chunks of yeast sediment settle around the bottom of the glass but are easily stirred -- gives the beer a slightly heavier feel as you gulp a little much of it at the end. All in all, the sweetness is a tad powerful. But considering the abv on this, it's impressively well done.","marburg","Apr 18, 2003"

On second thought, no it doesnt. Being alive is occasion enough! Lovely garnet in color with some sediment floating about. Medium sized, light tan head fades to a moderate, creamy and persistent top. The aroma is simply to die for. Malty sweet, maybe a bit nutty, with a healthy dose of candi sugar and a deep fruitiness. God I love these Grand Crus. Taste starts off sweetly malty, perhaps just a bit toasty, then becomes fruity with an ever-so-slight hint of tartness. Lightly peppery toward the finish. Sheesh, is there alcohol in this beer at all? If there is, its damn hard to find amidst the big creamy and oh-so-smooth body. Delicious.

Hints of plums, candied apples, rum soaked rasins, and full yeasty goodness. Lots of suspended particles, I think helped the alcohol settle down. Nice crisp, bitter finish.

4.97,18.1,4.5,5,5,5,5,"For my 100th review, I chose something from my favorite style that has been highly recommended to me. Let's see... Pours a deep mahogany brew, which is slightly hazy. A thick cream-colored head forms on top. A beautiful beer. The head retains quite well. Well, this has to be one of the best beer aromas I've ever smelled! All kinds of complexities in here. Most obvious I'd say is a sweet raisin aroma. Many spices are present that I wouldn't expect out of a beer in this style, but that just makes it all the more unique and wonderful. Kind of hard to place, but I'd say cinnamon, allspice, nutmeg... things like that. It's also very fruity, like passion fruit or something tropical. There's a hint of sourness in there as well. Maybe some banana? It's just a pleasure to sit back and take in this aroma! Now for the flavor. A wave of caramel sweetness with the aforementioned spice twang riding in on top enters your mouth ever so smoothly. A bit of hop bitterness is detectable when it hits the middle. Cherry bourbonish flavor. Dark fruits are present throughout (raisin and plum). Some berries here and there. Slightly bready in the malt department besides the caramel. Wonderful mouthfeel. Smooth, thick, and rich. The finish is just as smooth as the rest. I want to say it's full-bodied, but it's so subtle. I'd say medium-full. I would never have guessed at the 10% abv if I hadn't looked at the bottle. A great beer to relax with, incredibly drinkable. Overall, this is one of the best beers I've ever tasted! An excellent pick for my 100th, I must say. I'm speechless!","hyuga","Nov 29, 2002"
4.97,18.1,4.5,5,5,5,5,"Now this is what Belgian beer is all about. It pours a beautiful reddish brown with a smallish head that disappears rather quickly. The smell is absolutely remarkable, with floral, fruit, and pepper/spice aromas on top of a slightly musty smell. I was almost afraid to start drinking it out of fear that I'd be left without that wonderful smell. However, the taste makes the next step more than worth it. Cherries, flowers, caramel, pepper, and a host of other flavors swim around and work together perfectly in this spectacular beer. The alcohol is warming but certainly not overwhelming; it doesn't taste or smell like a 10% beer. If you see this don't leave without out it.

Front is engagingly sweet, the top light, the finish is forcefully acidic, cleverly hopped, the aftertaste droughty.

Aroma consists primarily of dark ripe fruits, carmelized sugar and a whiff or two of alcohol. Initial taste is tart with tight carbonation. Mouthfeel smooths out as the brew warms. Flavors are a blend of fruity esters; raisins, prunes, dates and a bit of a yeasty tartness. A mild ethanol burn follows each sip. The sweetness of this beer has moments of stickiness, but is never cloying. Not quite as spicy as some grand crus, but a solid, very tasty dark Belgian strong ale.","John","Jul 30, 2002"
4.77,13.3,4.5,5,4.5,5,5,"Two fingered, uniform off white head tops a clear dark ruby hued brew if decanted off the yeast. True lace is left down the glass. Crisp, vibrant fruity esters reminescent of slightly unripe raspberries and citrus in aroma, accompanied by sweet biscuit and notes of buttery malt. Heaty alcohol is perceptible only with a deep inhalation. As the brew breathes the aroma takes on a floral, red rose - like character. Very enticing, and highly appetizing aromawise. Fruity sweetness upfront in flavor yields to a light malt profile comprised of bready and buttery malt. Sweetness becomes floral and perfume like mid palate. When combined with the malt profile, I am reminded of raspberry preserves on rustic bread. Moderate to full in body, with a smooth mouthfeel lent both by the relatively low carbonation and residual dextrins. Hop bitterness is appropriately low and would only detract from the layered sweetness. Yeast fermentation byproducts are surprisingly mild and consist of trace green apple acetaldehyde only. Finishes pleasantly sweet, w/ lingering rose petal notes. Abbaye de Rocs has produced a stellar Grand Cru. It's complex and enjoyably sweet, yet unbelievably clean, with a striking deep floral character. The drinkability is simply unparalleled.","marc77","Beers"
