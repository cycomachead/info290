"Dark brown look with a Nice creamy white head, complex flavor Carmel malt and floral with a smooth finish. Style Hides the high alcohol level well."
"I bought two of these and had them over the course of two nights. Nice dark color with a thick tan head that goes down very slowly. It's a very nice beer that would go well with steak and potatoes. However, Beer Advocate has the ABV wrong, it's actually 10.0."

"I have seen comments that it's to much for the money. But you get what you pay for if you want the best you pay for it ,while some of the other labels within chimay are great this one is outstanding. This is the best of its kind I have tried dozens of Belgium style beers and this is the best from the floral smell to the sweet taste it is so complex yet so perfectly balanced you will not be displeased with this one. if you are a true beer drinker  stop being so cheap and treat your self to pure bliss on earth if God truly made a beer this is it!"

"A little too yeasty for me. A very solid belgian ale... but if you are looking to spend $$$ on a belgian that is readily- available... would rather go with Unibroue or support my local micro- brews testing out new belgian brews."

"You can't get much better in this category.  It is pricey, but you get what you pay for.  While some of the other Chimay styles are not the best in their respective categories, this one definitely is."

"Instant favorite."

"O: An exceptional beer & MUCH better then the red IMHO. Great job Chimay, THIS is what a trappist beer should taste like!"
"Overall a big time winner, the staple for a great quad or Belgian strong dark style, esp good with some nice age on it. Great dark fruits, sweet flavors without being too sweet, mild syrupy but dry finish somehow, mild booze, nice level of phenols, nice malty character, just well done all around. When I have that itch for this style of beer, this hits the spot quite nicely."
"A beautiful hazelnut coloured brew. In the light, a nice bright hue is present. A muted smell of smoky coffee. Tastes alcoholic yet pleasant, malty yet refined. A truly polished creation. The monks really thought this one through. Prost!"
""

"- stands up to its name, understand why this is a famous Belgium beer!"

"O – A fantastic, complex, tasty and still accessible quad.  Had this with an aged cheddar, creamy gouda, and pungent blue cheese, and it was a great match with all three, and incredible on its own.  Would drink this any time, anywhere."
""
"11oz bottle poured into tulip. Appearance is brown with yeast suspended in the active carbonation that builds to a two inch head before collapsing to a cap. Little lacing is left on the glass. Aroma is clove, dried fruit, pepper, caramel malt, sugar, and alcohol. Taste is sweet bready malt, sugar-topped raisins, clove, and booze. Medium-full body, active carbonation, creamy texture, and a dry, slightly bitter finish."
""
""
""
""
"I am neutral on this beer."
""
""
""
""
"I feel in love with Belgium beers through Chimayt Red. This is a wonderful strong dark. Worth a try to be sure!"
"O: This is a good Belgian ale overall and helping out the monks has to be a plus :p"
"The flavor profile is intense, slightly complex but not well balanced due to the lack of alcohol coverage.  The aroma flavors are present, but get overwhelmed by alcohol.  It begins with dark fruit, then light caramel, over an underlying tobacco element.  In the middle alcohol takes over and never relinquishes it's hold through the finish.  Caramel and dark fruit notes are underneath, but are simply overwhelmed.  Perhaps this bottle is old, but since it has no bottle date..."
""
"Huge, off-white head thick as foam. Brown, amber in color and clear. Clingy lacing all down the glass on this one. Aroma of malt, grains and farm. Is slippery smooth, malty, a tad spicy, somewhat sweet & well carbonated and warming. There is a lot going on in this beer. Finishes semi dry. A perfect brew for anytime & season. Give this to your wine snobs."
""
"Pours hazy brown with a finger of dense, creamy head. Yeasty esters, bread, and lightly caramelized sugar take the nose.Tastes of bread, some alcohol, and a slight sweetness make this a great example of the style - a favourite of mine."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This beer is all about juxtaposition, with clashing characteristics rising to such an intensity that they are on the verge of not quite blending. And yet, blend they do, when all is said and done. Chimay Grand Reserve is like a couture gown. It makes you cock your head and go, ""huh?"" for a second, but then all you can hope to do is marvel in its extravagant beauty."
""
""
"Overall - This beer is deeply complex in its flavour but it has some downfalls in the mouth feel so that it lost some marks there for me. Having said that no element of this beer drops below a four which makes it a winner"

"Poured from a 750ml bottle into a westmalle goblet. Dark brown with decent carbonation. Smell is belgian. Tastes like a strong dark belgian ale but I'm not a huge fan of the slightly bitter hop flavor which comes through especially in the aftertaste. Esters and sweet dried fruit are less prominent. A good dark belgian ale but for the price there are others I will buy first."
""
"I was pleased with this one. It's hard to compare living in WV and not able to have a lot of great beer often. Tasted the floral hints after a sweet initial hit. Ended thick and wanting more. Had three with steak and stuffed shrimp. Excellent."
"Just nearly perfect. Subtle caramel notes. Balance. Consistent. Ages very well."
""
"Was a little disappointed with this one.  Was strong for the sake of being strong and didn't represent the style to its capability."

"Overall : Very well crafted and balanced. Easy to drink trappist beer."
"Spent New Years Eve in Brussels.  Asked in a restaurant for a good dark beer and given Chimay Grande Reserve (Blue).  Amazing taste and after one glass set you in the right festive frame of mind.  Great with cheese and understand matures with age.  Brought several bottles home to UK.  If you like dark beers, particularly Porters, then you will not be disappointed with Chimay Blue"

"classic.  my favorite monk made beer. i would love a trip to Belgium"
"I had this at Christmas, and boy was it a Christmas treat.  I really like the champagne-like quality of this dark, fruity brew.  The taste of alcohol is definitely there (9% ABV) but does not overpower the drink.  Taste is almost reminiscent of wine, with that bubbly texture on the tongue that tickles the senses.  Overall, this is a very, very good Belgian Dark Ale."

"Overall: It's Chimay, so I was always going to like it. It's slightly heavier going than the Première but none the worse for it - definitely a beer for sipping whilst cogitating and a fine example of a Trappist dubbel. Widely available too, which is nice."
"Another great beer from Chimay.  A little bit of after taste is probably the only thing bad I noticed....but that wouldn't discourage me to get it again."
""

""

"I brought an Allagash White to a party once, thinking I was going to be treating my friends.  But i was ""one upped"" by a friend who broke out a bottle of Chimay Grande Réserve.  Even I had to bow.  A bold flavor that's as smooth tasting as the sound of its name."

"Two fingers of large bubbled , almost beige head, cap the top of the beer, with lacing all down the sides of the glass. Retention was great. Cloudy brown in color, appearing downright murky. Aroma of red wine, fresh baked bread,  dates, and a very subtle spice note. This beer definitely was aiming for more of the dark fruit notes found in quads v.s the spicy phenolic notes. On the palate the maltiness comes through more but the dark fruit hangs around too. Bready and rich on the palate. Finish is of dark caramelized fruits. Alcohol doesn't even exist in this beer. It leans on the sweet side but still maintains a nice balance. Carbonation wipes the palate clean and keeps the drinker coming back sip after sip. Maybe not enough spice IMO but none the less a great offering, easily available and  a real nice sipper."

"This is my favorite beer. I drink it out of a goblet. Pours very nice with about 2 inches of foam which will slowly settle. Good carbonation. T- it Is what you'd want out of a Belgian Trappist beer on steroids. All the hints of dates, carmel, and also has a nice spice. Overall this beer is a top five beer in my opinion. Good alcohol content and good on any occasion but preferably cold weather. I like to eat a steak and Caesar salad while drinking it. Price is the only negative"

"Brownish copper.  Malty aroma with some caramel notes.  The flavor profile is definitely malt forward but there are dry notes on the finish.  The alcohol is well hidden for such a high ABV offering."

"O - Chimay Grand Reserve or Chimay (Blue) as most refer to it as, is a simple yet world class Belgian Strong Dark ale and really the perfect option to begin with exploring bigger Trappist ales. It's been a real favorite of mine since our first encounter, and one I'll grab on a few more than special occasions every year. Just a classy ale from a classy brewery. Chimay offering are all world class, but the blue is their way of showing you how talented and perfected a beer recipe can be."

"Quality in a bottle. It has everything you need from a premium beer. The high alcoholic strength means it has more depth and the ability to carry all the flavours without being sickly. An antidote to the majority of english beers which often have impressive flavours but lack the depth the alcohol brings. Well done Monks and Brewers at Chimay"

"Just like a Fine wine this beer is rich and complex. Its smooth and rich with a round finish and feels wonderfully balanced. The color when poured is a deep amber / burgundy with a thick tan head fizzing on top. Tasting this beer makes me feel like I am by a fireplace on a cold winter night. Its warming and has bold notes of spice and oak chips, figs and vanilla, all wrapped up with a slight dark chocolate finish. All with smooth medium body. All I can say is I love it."

"Words do not do this beer justice, as this is quite easily the tastiest beer ever created. The label looks somewhat nondescript, much like other Trappist beers, but it hides the one of the most complex tastes of any beer I've ever had the pleasure to drink. It's, sweet, fruity, and also slightly peppery, with the faintest hint of bitterness; it's heavily spiced and smells strongly of cloves. I had one of the larger 750 ml bottles, and with its 9% ABV, it certainly hit the spot. This pairs superbly with a juicy, medium-rare steak."

"Poured into goblet from 0.75L bottle.  Appears very dark brown with a tinge of auburn when held up to a light.  No real head to speak of, but little carbonation bubbles are pretty consistent.  Nose is sweet.  Raisin, red wine, and preserved plum are scents that I am reminded of.  Bready yeast is also in there.  Taste is not as sweet as the nose in my opinion.  Malt even comes through with some roasty, coffee like bitterness in the midst of the toffee sweetness and bready and yeasty flavors.  Mouthfeel is perfect with a nice amount of carbonation and a long lasting almost syrupy finish.  I love this beer.  This beer really helped to get me into the craft thing years ago and I know I can always go to it for a great drink and some memories."

"DATE REVIEWED: June 15, 2014... GLASSWARE: Chimay chalice... OCCASION: saluting the Spurs for knocking off LeBron--and celebrating father's Day as well...APPEARANCE: ark chocolate purple body; one finger pale off-white head--creamy... AROMA: immediate floral yeasts pitch thee malts favorably; a wine/red grape insinuation--promising... PALATE: smooth, velvety dry as a pinot noir; soft aftertaste; warming but not overt--a body that is more than sippable, and one that demands immediate revisiting... TASTE: big yet palatable flavor, reminiscent of grape and dry wine tannins; malts are subdued, slightly toasted; well balanced... OVERALLL: a great nightcap to a great Father's Day; 9% ABV never felt so good...."

"I'm a beer lover, not a beer expert nor gourmet. Maybe my taste buds were destroyed by too much Busch in my college days. I tried to like this beer but couldn't. It seemed over-carbonated and it seemed to have a raw alcohol taste. Maybe i'm not used to 9 percent beer, maybe the monks had a bad day, or maybe I'm just a low-brow beer lover. I will give it another chance."

"To be honest, this is probably the best beer I have tasted to date. For a 9% beer, the mixture of flavors and yeast is unmatched while masking the alcohol. A must have for any beer lover. Bought at Costco in Washington for about 12$ in the large corked bottle."
"Somehow this beer's spicy aspects make this a refreshing brew to sip, with subtle dark fruit/ fig notes appearing more so as it warms."

"Overall the best points are the mellow flavors, smooth body and strong 9% ABV. The only downsides would be the cost, and maybe the sediments at the very bottom. Considering the high price over other similar beers, it certainly makes my Samuel Smith Porter and Oatmeal stout buys look like a bargain. However with that said, I certainly look forward to trying their other beers."

"As you have determined, I think Chimay Grande Reserve is a world-class brew that I only drink on special occasions due to its exceptional taste. I have found that if I drink only one type of brew for a while, I tend to get ""tired"" of it and I never want to get tired of this one."

"T: Rich dark malt and dark fruit notes mingle with baking spice, Belgian yeast, cloves, some dark bread, and just a touch of booze on a drying finish. Mouthfeel is a touch light, but still smooth and complements the flavors well. To me, this doesn't come close to being as complex as a Westy 12 or Rochefort. Still, it's a great beer that deserves its accolades."

"Picked up a bomber due to high ratings and figured worth a try. Not an outstanding looking beer, head is a little thin, dissipates quickly. Smell is outstanding, absolutely has me salivating. Amazing flavor, perfect in my book, nothing to complain about. Smooth, tasty, amazingly easy to drink for 9%, wonderful beer that I will revisit as a treat due to cost."

"This is the first review I'm going to write and it was this beer that inspired me. To me, this was the perfect beer. Mellow, smooth, and strong. I've been trying different porters, stouts, barley wines, and old ales but this one was the most approachable and balanced. It wasn't the best 'everyday' beer but that's not what I was looking for... Perfect sipper, great taste!"

"O: Almost great, but that metallic strangeness kind of hurts. This and the mellow aroma keep it out of the fabled 4 range, sadly. I imagine this would go great with a stank-ass cheese (preferably from Chimay themselves), and this is certainly worth having again to find out. Still, my favorite (non-quad) BSDA remains Gouden Carolus Classic."
"A Chimay é outra grande cervejaria trapista belga, e essa cerveja parece ser o carro chefe do selo. Elas são mais leves e equilibradas que as outras trapistas. Menos complexas e mais versáteis. A blue é escura e forte na medida. As versões em rolha são realmente surpreendentes."
"Body is chestnut colored, lots of foam, some even oozing out of the bottle. Average retention with minimal lacing, expected more. The rest is great though. Inviting aroma including spices, flavor is rich with dark plums, candied fruits, fruit cake and a bit of sugar. Overall, a great ale, just needs work on the appearance."
""
""
""
"Overall 4.0: Outstanding Belgian Dark, but not the best I have ever had. The bouquet is a bit off and the taste is somewhat one-dimensional, but -nonetheless-- this is an excellent brew. So, my advice is to save up your sheckles and buy a bottle of this to try. Then once you have done so, save up some more money (less than Chimay, BTW) and buy a bottle of St. Feuillien Speciale instead. Or, go to your local Trader Joe's and buy 750ML of a comparable beer for $5."

"Poured from a 330 ml bottle into a genuine Chimay goblet. Perhaps lighter than expected, a ruddy orange-brown with a massive amount of tannish head. The forth settles down a bit but the carbonation remains brisk. Although one's Belgian dark ale schema is screaming heavy and thick, this classic is in fact silky smooth, creamy, and of only moderate body, although the flavors are assertive enough. Aroma of cooked orchard fruit (pears and apples), raisins, dates, sweet grains, and a decent dose of cellar must. Boozy and a bit funky in the yeast sense. Although the aroma is not terribly spicy (maybe its my crap sense of smell), the palate is spice-forward ... Pepper and pumpkin pie spice, cloves, and a rather unique and very pleasing floral/herbal essence like dried basil and sandalwood. Malts remind one of rye bread and hints of toasted crust. Sweet rum, dates, treacle, a whiff of chocolate ... A fresher fruitiness as well in this example, almost like Concord grapes. Intermittent blasts of alcohol. The king of Chimay. Perhaps lighter and drier than other Belgian darks but has its own herbal/floral character paired with the yeast, spice, and dark fruit one would expect. A standby in my beer fridge and shockingly drinkable for such a heavy hitter."

"750 ml bottle into signature chalice, bottled in 4/2013. Pours moderately hazy deep ruby red color with a 1-2 finger fairly dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a large amount of streaming carbonation retaining the cap. Aromas of big pear, apple, raisin, plum, pepper, clove, banana, caramel, candi sugar, toast, brown bread, floral, and yeast earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of fruity/spicy yeast ester and malt notes; with good strength. Taste of big raisin, plum, pear, apple, light banana, caramel, candi sugar, toast, brown bread, clove, pepper, floral, and yeast earthiness. Lingering notes of light/dark fruits, light banana, clove, pepper, caramel, candi sugar, toast, brown bread, floral, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a while. Fantastic complexity of malt and fruity/spicy yeast flavors; with a great crisp malt/fruity/spicy flavor balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a lightly slick, crisp, and moderately prickly mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a highly excellent Belgian dark ale. All around great balance and complexity of fruity/spicy yeast and malt flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the ABV. A highly enjoyable offering."

"Poured a deep brown, with a two-finger fluffy off-white head that grew for a few minutes, then began to recede to a thick ring of off-white leaving modest lacing. Excellent, true to form for a good Trappist ale. Scents of Belgian yeast, candi sugar, dark fruit, molasses, raisins, prunes, a slight metallic twinge, peppery, spicy scents, grape, slight apple, banana comes forward as it warms, melding with the other aromas to make a nice, sweet scent. Very faint hints of alcohol in the background. A rich, sweet, deep aroma with an amazing complexity, as expected of a Trappist ale. Flavor follows the nose. It is quite sweet up front notes of apple, raisin, dark fruit, and slight pear. As it warms in the mouth sweet caramel malt, honey, and spicy flavors begin to emerge, melding with the fruit. As you swish spicy clove and alcohol notes emerge in the back of the mouth. Candi sugar and Belgian yeast spiciness and hints of faint herbal qualities and wood in the background are present throughout. Finish is spicy and burns the nose slightly, with alcohol, clove, yeasty spice, and some non-descript sweet spices. All the flavors meld wonderfully throughout the sip and lead to a rich, complex, satisfying flavor, warming and perfect for cold weather. Mouthfeel is medium-heavy bodied, slightly sticky, moderately carbonated and with a semi-drying finish in the mouth. Quite nice. A very good sipping beer. Quite pleasant, with maybe just a touch too much carbonation for me. Overall this an excellent Trappist ale. It is a fine Belgian Strong Dark, with all the depth, complexity and nuance of the style. It is a fine beer to sip on a cold night, strong, with a great depth of scent and flavor. Truly excellent."

"I've been searching for a flaw in this beer over the course of this review and continue to come up empty-handed after half an hour, so I do not give it all fives flippantly but as a last resort. It's just a perfect, benchmark entry in my favorite category, Belgian strong dark ales and quads."
""
""
"The classic drying tendency eventually takes over the tongue. A bitter edge finally emerges in the aftertaste. The echoes of the sweet malt linger faintly. This does set a standard for strong, dark Belgians."
""
"O - One of the original quad archetype. It reminds you how well balanced and restrained this style used to be before American brewers started brewing the style on steroids."
"I will say this--it is an excellent beer to sip on while sitting on my back patio enjoying this cool October evening in the Midwest. Cheers!"
"Overall, ignore the price tag and get you some, if you think Budweiser is the king of beers, you are lost. Chimay is my favorite beer so far will definitely need another bottle."

"Final Grade: 4.51, an exceptional A grade. This isn't a style I drink much of on a regular basis, but Chimay Blue is easily my favourite BSDA so far. This is delicious fresh, but I think it's safe to say it would be worth holding onto a bottle or two for a few years - this stuff is made for cellaring, and I hope to review this same vintage in 2015-16 or so. The only problem: mustering up the self-control required to stop myself from opening the remaining bottles of this incredible brew until then!"
""
""
"O: A wonderful strong Belgian with beautiful, complex dark cherry and caramel notes. Seek a pour of this complex and dark beverage. I'd never turn this brew down if offered some."
""
""
"Probably the most readily available take on the style, but it doesn't disappoint. I've had it several times before, but always served too cold and in the wrong glassware. It's a much different--and much better--experience when slightly chilled and poured in a proper chalice. This beer has fantastic flavor--notes of fruit and caramel, but enough spice that it's not cloyingly sweet. The taste belies the high alcohol content, but the booze gives off a nice warming feeling. An excellent choice for a cool night."

The scent was a roasty Belgium sweet malt. The taste was a good combo of roast and caramel mixed with Belgium sweetness. The mouthfeel was fuller in body with subtle carbonation.

"A: Forceful pop of the cork which let out some wispy steam, hefty carbonation that eventually oozed from the top of the bottle, tarnished copper to burgundy - 3.75, S: Sweet chalkiness, what I perceive as a touch of clove on the nose, quite yeasty along with some pitted fruits such as plum and maybe dates, a little milder than what I’d generally expect – 3.50, T: Dark fruits including figs raisins, quite sweet and bready, very noticeable alcohol that borders on being distracting, medicinal and spicy – 3.75, M: Medium bodied, hint of grit within a creamy mouth – 4.00, D: A very enjoyable beer and quite drinkable – 3.50"

"sort of the classic trappist brew, highly available, highly acclaimed. its like the best of a dubble and the best of a quad in one. the pours is dark like raisins and molasses, with a fluffy bubbly Belgian yeast tan head, and the nose is basically the same, dried fruit, dates and figs, and the yeast. some mild spice notes, vanilla, and sweet Belgian candy sugar all make strong appearances on the palate, and the darker sweeter malts have a pronounced fruity character to them, like dried cherries and plums. alcohol is hot here, but it doesn't seem out of place at all. as sweet as it is, the finish mellows, and comes in very smooth, dangerously drinkable for such a rich and decadent brew. a little light on carbonation compared to its peers, and a little thick in body to me, but this beer is a testament to the great trappist brewing tradition, and a beer that deserves to be regarded as highly as it is. just expert."

"Had it with Rochefort 8 and Gulden Draak. Dark brown, almost black in colour, dark and dried fruits on the nose and palate, pleasant bitterness in the aftertaste. It deserves to be on the top of the list of this beer style, right there with Rochefort 8. Don't drink it cold!"

"Disturbingly frothy white head over a highly seductive and darkly impenetrable body. Not much aroma to my nose. The taste seems very one-dimensional in comparison to other strong dark ales and is not particularly strong to my taste. The froth persists in the mouth and feels more substantial than it is."

"The tight, fine carbonation does a lively dance on the insides of lips and all over the tongue. Working together with the booze, it creates a bright burn that's mirrored in the gut as the 9% begins to collect. The tannic dryness of a wine offsets sweetness well and makes me reach for the glass again. Wait long enough between gulps, and buccal surfaces feel almost metal-polished--a reminder that there are hops doing their part. All these moving parts keep this fat, creamy monk from smothering you--he's jolly and round, but never too heavy. A true classic religious experience."

"Although this beer is very smooth and easy to drink, it is heavy on the stomach. Its complexity is daunting, I think."
""
""
""
"This is a really fine Trappist beer and may be one of the best beers that I have ever tasted (although I still have to try the other Chimay varieties!). It is dark amber with a generous head. It is bouncing with flavour and is very, very smooth. There is a very slight bitter aftertaste. However, it is 9% ABV so I don't think I would have more than two or three bottles in one sitting as there is a definite kick off it. By the way, I don't have a Chimay Chalice glass so I used a pretty similar looking very large red wine glass instead!"

"O- a great example of Belgian strong dark ale. A good gateway to getting into all that Belgian beers offer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"First sip is explosive with flavor. Sweet up front, tangy on the sides, and rich through the middle. Super fine carbonation tickles the front of my tongue and dances all over my mouth. This compliments the malt flavors and contrasts nicely with the super heavy richness that the ale otherwise conveys. Oh, and it 9% ABV it's a great drink, not at all too heady."

"Overall: Surprised me in a very good way. I somewhat stuck my nose up at it as one of the most common Trappist beers. Very solid beer, especially for the price and availability (3.50 Euros here to $11 back in the States). Pairs great with Belgian frites."

"Overall Impression: With strong and well developed malt flavors in balance with finishing bitterness, this Quad stands up with the best of them"

"Pours cloudy and dark brown with just a little bitterness on the nose. Little head that went away fast. Opaque and doesn’t smell too fruity sweet like it’s brother the Chimay Red. Patchy lacing, nice cap. Strong carbonation, toasted malt. floral hops. Medium body and the sweet fruit is in the short finish. A Chimay is guaranteed civility."

"There is no perfect beer or ale! But this one is close. A true gift of God made by his servants. Bought a 750ml for about $15. Worth every penny. The Blue is a real treat. Better to leave in the glass a few minutes and let it start to warm a bit to release all of its potential and some of the CO2. Smooth as silk and full mouth feel with a hint of the strong alcohol content. Add this one to your bucket list."
""
""
""

"O - I am disappointed,but important is that this beer is high quality product. It is not by my taste. Also,this is like Champagne of beers. Very refreshing carbonation in it."
""
""
"I'm liking this a lot more, revisiting it a year later. Nice and crisp for an ale. Boozy but clean and strong."
""
"Poured from a bottle into a chalice, the beer is a dark, hazed, almost opaque, amber-brown coloring with a tall, dense, yellowish head that starts around an inch and settles into a thick film. Aromas of richly sweet date and grapes, giving it a wine-like characteristic. Some subtle spicing of nutmeg and all-spice, with a tone of alcohol throughout, as well. Smells balanced and rich. Flavors are very rich, with heavy old-world fruit sweetness giving a rich and robust blast to the palate. Nutmeg and clove clean up the tail end of the palate, and there is a tangy toffee sweetness that carries through into the aftertaste. The carbonation keeps the beer light and crisp despite full flavors and a full body. Clean, smooth finish, with a tangy sweet and slightly boozy linger. Very solid, very balanced, and very tasty."
""
""
""
""
"O- I was extremely impressed with this beer the first time I tried it. Comes close to a quad, with very diverse flavors and a great feel."
""
""
""
""
"Poured into a Boulevard Brewing Co tulip glass I use when reviewing special beers, primarily Belgians. Nice plop from the cork, a strong indication of the carbonation level to come. Nice fizz with a thick head that dissipates very quickly. Very dark amber color, hints of ruby red. when held up to the light. Mouth feel is a little excessive from the carbonation. It could mellow a bit with more cellar time, like several months: I bought this one only two weeks ago and have been itching to try it.. Not real sure about this at first, wasn't at all what I expected. Starting to like it more and more with each sip. Noticing sherry, caramel, VERY mild hops, dark Belgian candy sugar. Nicely blended, well-crafted, a very good desert beer with chocolate. Alcohol content is hidden well, but still present. The only ""knock"" for lack of a better term would be very mild smell, and the slight over-carbonation of this particular bottle at this time. Smell would take away from the complexity of the blend. I really can see it mellowing with age and moving up a couple of notches. As the glass sits for a couple of minutes and the carbonation dissipates, the true nature of this beer comes out, especially the sherry, caramel roasted malt and the complexity of the blend.."
"O: This was not really what I expected. That being said, it was a great beer and well worth the year of waiting while it sat patiently in my beer cave. I found the alcohol taste a little more forward than I expected but it was overcome by the other qualities of this beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A great beer, a little more complex than Chimay Red but for the same price, however for the same price of other trappists like Westmalle Trippel and Rochefort 10, Chimay cannot endure, at least to me, but it worth the try!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"M - Medium body, moderate carbonation."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This beer pours a nice mahogany brown with a off white head. The head ends of at about 2 fingers and is persistent. The flavor is malty with dried fruit in the finish. Over all a great beer that you can come back to year after year. I recommend this beer to anyone that like Belgian beers."
""
""
"O-Exceptional brew. Complex, but all notes in the nose and on the palate make a strong presence. Well-balanced, alcohol is hidden well. My only complaint would be that it feels too carbonated and needs to finish with a creamier feel"
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall. Pretty hard to say anything negative about a beer like this. A standard for the style and never a disappointment."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I generally dont like to drink trappist beers, but this was a nice experience, gained a new appreciation for the style and maybe I will have to drink more."
""
""
""

"O: complex, yet easy drinking. There is alot going on here to think about. but it drinks fairly easy. this is exactly what i think about when i think of a belgian beer; tart, sweet, bready, yeasty, malty and oh so good. if you are looking to get into belgian beers, this is a must try."

"330ml bottle. BB 2018. Amber brown colour with a dense,  light tan head and left some nice lacing. Aroma of caramel, raisins, sherry and alcohol. Medium sweetness and minimal bitterness. Smooth,  medium-full bodied with alcohol warmth. Like drinking a fine fortified wine. Delicious. I can't fault this one, one of my favourites. 10."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Very smooth on the tongue this is as diverse as any. Candied fruits like date fig and prune start but then a bready maltiness takes over. Alcohol warmth fills the chest as raisin and even licorice finish it out. Small amount of alcohol stays on the tongue but other than that this is a real triumph."
""
""
"This cooper/ruby-toned beer has a creamy, lightly-tanned neck. The aroma only pronounces at the right serving temperature (higher than usual), showing a toasty/caramelly tone, with strong fruity esters (apples, pears, bananas, dark fruits). A little perfume and spice are also present. The taste displays the malt profile appropriately, which is harmonized with the alcohol here. The body is medium and well-carbonated, and the hops are very discreet. The end is dry, and the aftertaste appears as a crescendo, with sharp bitterness."

"Overall: Honestly, i like Chimay Red more. Everyone seems to like the Blue the most, and i've yet to try the Yellow, but this one was just too sweet for me. It is still a very good beer that i will be buying again and again as i'm a huge fan of trappist beer, but i really thought the red was more balanced. Which is weird because I usually like the higher abv beers more. If you've had other trappist beers, this one is probably the most unique out of the 6 trappidt breweries i've tried. Not the best, but a great beer worthy of trying, if they are sold out of Chimay Red..."

"Never ever not a great beer. So smooth. Bready, balanced, loads of figs. Love the heat. Velvety. Medium full body. I love all the Chimays, but I now prefer this to the others. The Belgians do big beers that are balanced better than anyone. Consistently a great beer. How could anyone not love this?"

"Trying Chimay Blue is a moment which every beer drinker should look forward to. This is a beer which I savored over the course of about two hours or so, and I am grateful to have tried it in a time span which I knew would be uninterrupted. Beautifully layered and complex – I am eager to try this with some age on it."

""
""
""
""
"Overall: This is a very enjoyable beer. While other Trappist ales are more to my liking, this is still very good in its own right. Very easy to drink considering the alcohol content, and also readily available just about anywhere. A bit on the expensive side ($14 per bottle in my area), but this isn't out of the norm for Trappist ales. Definitely worth a try."
""

"O: fantastic BSDA but those crazy catholics in Belgium know their beer."
""
""
""
""
"I recommend searching for a video on Youtube called ""Chimay Brewery Tour", which increased my appreciation for this beer, and shows the fusion of monastic life, passion for beer, and high-technology which goes in to Chimay."
"This beer is really really tasty. The one thing that brought it down for me was the mouthfeel, which I found overly fizzy for a beer like this. But the rest of it is so good that it carries my overall enjoyment well up. I also found it better at relatively cool temperatures (~50 degrees F) than after it had warmed up a bit more."

"""Grande Reserve"" in 750 ml bottles is a dark Trappist beer with a powerful aroma, the complex flavour of which improves across the years. It was first brewed as a Christmas beer, explaining the presence of a ""vintage""."

"This beer sucks. Taste's like a carbonated milkshake, and is worse than the white version. Cant believe I spent five dollars on this poor excuse of a beer, while I could of got a bomber of Stone IPA for the same price. Those monks are drinking to much of their own product, and they're drunk during the entire process. I will try again once they sober up, and quit adding cinnamon and sugar to their beers. Why is there no one monitoring these drunk monks? What a life huh, drink beer all day and wear a jedi robe."

Perfectly happy with this and my new gold rimmed chalice that came with the pack."

"This is a very nice, balanced beer that is subtle but complex. This is a very malty beer that reminds me more of a quad or a trumped up dubbel. There are hints of candy sugar but the flavor is mostly dominated by rich caramel malts. There are some fantastic esters that add depth to the flavor and really make this is a solid beer. I am impressed also at its drinkability with such a high ABV. This is definitely worth a try."

"Chimay Grand Reserve pours a deep mahogany, with no real highlights noticeable. A finger or so of off white foam crowns the beer. Most of it fades away, but a solid iceberg like chunk remains long after. Lacing is pretty sparse. The nose is almost perfection. Lots of plum and fig, and spicy phenols are a secondary aroma. The flavor profile still has some dark fruit esters, and they're joined by a light caramel touch. The pepper and clove spicy notes are definitely more pronounced than in the nose, and just a hair too much so for my taste. The mouthfeel is fantastic, highlighted by a very well dried out body. The carbonation is plenty lively, but there's just a slight lack of creaminess to it. Chimay Grand Reserve is an absolute classic in the craft beer scene, and with good reason."

"Overall it is a pleasant drink, and one my wife enjoys as well, it will definitely be bought and drunk again."

"O: Great Belgian yeast flavors balanced with dark, flavorful malts. A hit among my less funk-friendly family. Flavorful and drinkable."
""
""
"MY REVISED SUMMARY (fresh bottle): Delicious. The balance of liquorish, dark dried fruits, rhubarb and general acidity has won me over. It's not quite as resplendent as some of the other Belgian dark ales, or I should say the flavours are not as exagerated, but it's beautifully balanced and very sensual. It'll be a staple when I finally leave Asia and go back to the UK."

"The taste is thick like the appearance, with loads of yeasty goodness. It lingers nicely with a Belgian goodness. This was a good choice for an early Christmas treat."

"Bottle from Belgianbeershop.com. Head: thick, beige, stable, nice lacing. Color: dark red brown, very beautiful. Aroma: filled with malts, notes of caramel and dark fruits. Alcohol is detectable. Taste: liquorice, dark fruits, well balanced sweetness-bitterness, complex. Mouthfeel: full, thick, smooth. This is a heart warming beer, filled with lots of different flavours. Wonderful brew but not the best of the Chimay trappists."

""
""
""

""

"O-This is certainly a great beer and one of the easier dark, strong Belgians to find when you're out and about. The flavors are solid and the feel is nicely balanced. However, it doesn't hold the same complexity or intensity as some of its Belgian cohorts or some of its North American competitors."

"Fantastic beer."
""
"Pours a solid dark brown with ruby highlights, and a generous tan/off-white head with some lacing. Notes of spice, grain, toffe and yeast greeted my nose. As it warmed, I tasted cocoa, vanilla … its malty sweetness (one of the richest malts you’ll ever taste) blends with a spicy yeastiness and a wonderful warmth from the alcohol. Easily a 5/5."

"O: Its what I expected and more, was in awe when this was brought out on the table, this beer is incredible, such a perfect balance. Goes down smooth and its fulfilling. It's very expensive, but for those one time occasions, takes the place of the champagne. A must try for everyone, great interpretation of the style, the archetype."
""
""
""
"O – This is just a great trappist, or Belgian Strong Dark Ale. I think that it is truly something special. Each time that I get it, I come to find I enjoy it a little bit better than the time before. This is a beer that originally changed the way I thought about beer, and now it still stands as part of my regular repertoire; and something I can always turn to knowing I will thoroughly enjoy it."

""
""
""
""
""
""

"Pours a solid dark brown with ruby highlights when held to light, and a decent sized off white head that dissipates too quickly leaving a cap on top. The aroma is filled with prunes, plums, raisins, and lots of dark and burnt sugars. Slight aroma of ethanol and a hint of yeast, with just a touch of earthy spicy hops. The flavor is rich and sweet with a full complement of dark dried fruits as well as some complex dark sugary flavors. Slight vinous quality as well as some bready yeasty flavors round this one out quite nicely. Medium to thick body with a spirited level of carbonation and a sweet syrupy burnt sugary mouthfeel. Nice brew, its been so long I had forgotten just how much I enjoyed this ale."
""
"Aroma of rum-soaked spice cake, raisin, estery yeast, and dark bread. Dark, opaque brownish red in color with ample carbonation and head. Profoundly sweet and fruity, with a variety of dessert and baking spices, raisin and lightly warming alcohol. Aftertaste is long, spicy, having a scant amount of hop flavor and continuing maltiness."

"Lady 65 knelt down and washed her hands in the chimay fountain. The way she knelt, I could see everything. She faced me. The skirt laid loosely. It was aged down there. You know what I mean. She walked over to me, saddlebags shifting from left to right, and splashed my face with the dark brown goodness. A bit splashed into my mouth. A taste of dark fruits hit, with a little chocolate coming off the end. Maybe it was her sweat, maybe it wasn't. She laughed and started farting. A spirit emanated from her anus, and came at me aggressively. I blacked out...."

"Excellent beer,I had it many times both in Belgium and France. Available in supermarkets for around one-two euros. Definitely one of the best beers easy to find in France. Pours red brown with a small head. Dark fruits aroma and somewhat sweet. I would gladly recommend it."

"Chimay, in fact Belgians are not exactly my style of brew but I really enjoyed Chimay Blue. The only reason I bought it was because I found a Chimay goblet for $3 and figured I might as well break it in with a bottle of Blue. I probably wouldn't drink more than one of these a night, but I wouldn't really want to. It's complex, sophisticated, and perfectly balanced. Worth a try even if you don't like Belgians."
""
""
"Overall: A great, great beer. One I would definitely recommend. This is my favorite style so far in my beer drinking adventure and this one would definitely be on my list of top BSDAs to try."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O: Not bad, but doesn't really come together, and the creamy texture doesn't complement the flavor."
""
"O: An excellent BSDA. Honestly not the best I've had, it's very sweet and fruity but oddly hot and not as complex as a lot I've had. Not to knock it, it's an excellent beer, especially considering how easy it is to obtain."

"I've had a few of these over the past decade or so and it seems a year or so of age on them does the world of good. This has plenty of potential, but at the moment isn't quite there. A beer that is always worth trying over time to see if it changes or if i do."
""
"Not as nuanced as some other beers in the style (speaking broadly of darkish Belgian ales), but worth drinking. Lots of flavor, but it's a bit brash and lacks that overall drinkability that some of the others have. The best showing in the Chimay lineup."

"Updated Sept 2012. I had a 750 bottle that I had sitting in the fridge for probably 2 years and I cracked it open on Labor Day. Upping the score on this beer as I can now really appreciate it (refined palate). Taste had a bunch more ripe fruit flavors with plum, grape, cherry, apple and a bit more caramel malt (probably due to the age). Not as sweet as stated in my initial review. Great beer, I had no problem downing a 750 over an evening. Still a sipper, but a fine one at that."

"Poured from 12oz bottle into chimay chalice. Pours a deep brown with amber hue and slight off white head. Banana, clove belgian yeast aromas. Great banana clove, yeast, and dried fruit flavors with a nice booze flavor at the end. Great, smooth strong with nice boozey notes. Really a world class brew."

"The mouthfeel is absolutely perfect for the style. Perfectly soft carbonation. Perfect attenuation. Overall, this is a very good beer. It misses the heights of some similar beers from De Struise or De Dolle but this is a lovely exemplar of the style."
""
""
""
"O - Excellent example of the style. One of the smoothest beers ever. This one had a little age on it and exceeded my expectations. Rich flavor, easy drinking."

"ours a beautiful deep red brown color with long lasting tan head. Sweet malt, light and dark fruit aroma. Dark fruits and spice to start, middle somewhat dry with more hops present, nice hop and spice dry finish. One of the world's great beers. Looking forward to comparing this to an aged one next year"
"Chimay Grande Reserve pours a dark dark brown color, with a nice creamy lasting head. There is a subtle sweet aroma, that has a darkness to it. The taste is dark and a bit smokey, there is a sweetness that becomes present, but then dispates. Good full complex flavor, I really enjoy that it isnt overkill with the belgin candy flavors. Overall this is a nice full flavored well made dark ale."
"O - A solid, well rounded brew. This beer hits the style well, and is a solid choice every time."

"330ml bottle, poured into a large tulip shaped wine glass. Dark amber colour with hints of ruby around the edge, almost opaque, 3 finger tanned head. Belgian yeasty aroma with notes of malt and raspberry. Tasted malt, caramel, raspberry, biscuit, plum and brown sugar. Booze very well hidden, balanced with a slightly bitter finish. Body was on the thick side of medium, smooth texture with decent carbonation. The depth of the beer combined with how well it hid the booze was very impressive, but I wouldn't say it blew me away. It might need to age for a year or two."
""
""
""
""
"O - Another extremely good offering from Chimay, no complaints here. I like that the beer does have some complexity to it, offering different flavors from the initial hit on the palate to the finish. I plan on cellaring a bottle to see how it changes over time."

""

"A world class beer, one that might not measure up to Westy but comes pretty darn close."

"Poured from a twelve ounce bottle into a Chimay chalice. The color is a dark brown the color of an oak barrel with a swirling of cherry red throughout. The head was fizzy, off-white to khaki and seemed to retreat back into the beer without much left in its wake. The nose didn't quite have that usual strong Belgian yeast I expect in a Belgian strong. It was there, just muted. There are also hints of plums and dates with a lot of fizz. The taste again has a very muted Belgian yeast character. There is sweet dates and cherries, but it finishes farily dry, preventing it from becoming overly cloying. Mouthfeel is heavy on carbonation; alcohol is masked well. I have always passed by this beer because I felt it was probably priced higher than it was worth, and I am just not finding a taste for Belgians. It's a good Belgian Strong, but it's not great."
""
""
"Overall - The cork came flying out as soon as I removed the cage - which I wasn't expecting. The amount of fizzy head lead me to believe there would be a lot of carbonation in the mouth, but it was fairly smooth. It has a nice complex taste and I can see why it is regarded so highly."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability - A bit heavy in the chest, as the carbonation fights right up until its swallowed alive. Alcohol is extremely well-balanced, and this brew avoids overdoing the notes of black cherry and coriander. An elastic and brisk burn that is not overdone. The brew can get a bit sweet at times, but it quickly balances itself out."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a deep molasses brown with a big white caramelized head that trembles down quickly and a thin lattice work of droopy lacing on the sides. This beer looks pretty in the glass, even with the chunks floating around in it. The smell is like a caramelized biscuit, sweet and malty with some good yeasty notes and light hints of fruits, molasses, brown sugars, candy sugars, and even a little citrusy tinge at the very end. It has a rich sweet taste like caramel and molasses. There is also a lingering flavor of dark fruit and, again, an ever so slight hint of citrus at the back of the taste along with a boozy back taste that can be quite strong. The taste is a little too sweet for my palate, reminiscent of sweet dark candies. It is oozing and thick in the mouth, however, which gives it a very nice feel. It is also a little cloying in the after effects on the mouth, leaving a thick wet trail of saliva on the tongue. Carbonation is nearly negligible in the taste. This is a nice dark Belgian with a lot of nice complex flavors in it. The sweet strikes a little too high in the initial gulp and lingers almost like a tingle in the edges of the mouth, but the mouthfeel is great, and the candied hints are virulently present in the taste. Overall it is a tasty dark Belgian ale, and a great example of the style. It’s rather heavy on the belly, and sweet for my tastes, but a decent beer overall."

"One of my favorite Belgian brews. Pours dark brown with some sediment and a creamy white head. Smells of chocolate and prunes, and incredible aromatic combonation here. Flavor is strong figs, plums, raisins, and nice chocolate combo, with nice alcohol warmth. Heavy/chewey mothfeel. Just perfect. I suspect that this bottle had been sitting around a while, as it is a bit lighter on the palate fresh. I prefer the heavier feel."

"O- another strong dark ale that just didn't work for me"
""
"How do they do it? Along with everything that is good about Belgian ale, Chimay has managed to stuff all the ambience of a Belgian bar into a bottle, and all at export prices. Nothing is out of balance here: the aroma is bready and heady but not overly yeasty, and the taste is so smooth and fruity and doesn't suffer from hard-edged hoppiness or overheated alcohol. This is something to enjoy at any time of the year, but especially on a colder-than-it-should-be May evening in New England. You cannot lose with any bottle from Chimay."

"O: Very good belgian dark ale, definitely one of my favorites."
""
"However you cut it, this beer isn't bad...it has a nice monolithic flavor but not as complex as the beers mentioned above. Ooops there I go again in the unfairness department. I'd perhpas try this again if I could get it on tap but with the other options out there in from similar styles, I would call this beer overrated."

"o: a very enjoyable BSDA, very widely available as well, perhaps a bit high carbonation, but very nice regardless."

"O: The alcohol is very well hidden in this beer, making it slightly dangerous if you have more than one... I think this beer is very enjoyable and a great sipping beer - with great complexity in the taste."
"Poured into a chalice. Pours dark caramel brown with an abundant tan head that dissipates quickly. The carbonation appears to be abundant. The sediment helped cloud the beer to make it opaque. There are aromas of dark fruits, malt, brown sugar, and yeast. There are tastes of bready dark malt, dark fruits like prunes and raisins, yeast, and brown sugar. The alcohol is present in the flavor as is some hop bitterness. It's very well balanced. The body is medium to full and the carbonation is quite lively. It's very easy to drink for such a strong beer. Overall, this is another excellent beer from the abbey. This is a top notch example of the style. It's easily acquirable in most stores, so Chimay provides a great entry for people wanting to try Trappist beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- A classic than definitely lives up to it's hype. Complex, warming and still quite easy to drink"
""
""
""
"This was the beer that really got my quest started. I have always been a big fan of Guinness Draught and Stout. And while standing inline one day at wal-mart a gentleman with a handlebar mustache asked me if I had ever tried Chimay before. He said if I liked dark beers the Guinness that I would really like the Chimay so I went on a quest to find some no one close carried it so I wound up in Evansville one night with my brother-in-law and we steped into a liquor store and they had a sampler pack of all 3 of the Chimays and a glass. I purchased the pack and the quest was started. I liked all 3 of the Chimays but the Grande Reserve Blue is my favorite."

"Two finger off white head with decent retention and little lacing on a dark murky brown body. Aroma is a little light with mostly raisin plum and yeast. Flavor is also more of the less sweet dark fruits including fig strawberry raisin and plum. Medium body and moderate to high  carbonation. overall as with others in the genre this one is yeasty and drinkable. Sort of a go to beer for this genre"
"Overall – A fantastic abbey beer. It’s renowned and a classic for a reason."

"Overall: Stellar. One of my favourites now. It's been a while since I had the Premiére, so I'll have to try that again soon to compare, but the G.R. could very well be better in my opinion. Either way an extremely enjoyable beer, one that I would strongly recommend. A must for any Belgian Ale fan (or just ale fan in general). I've heard much about how this beer ages, so I'll definitely be buying a few more to cellar."

"I decided a while ago that I would buy two bottles of this every year and store them in the basement. To date, I have bought far more than I have actually drank. I can't wait to try it with 5 or 6 years on it. I hear it's a real stunner."
"Still holds on to greatness as it is a few steps ahead of the middle of the pack, with that said there are other Belgian beers that easily surpass this but not so much that I would not keep on coming back."

"o: bsda, bsda, gonna guess an older chimay blue, based on c'c bottle. neorunner agrees. delicious and happy to have shared it b/c of higher abv creeping into my non-dinnered stomach."

"O: Overall, a very solid brew.  The quintessential beer of the style, and certainly worth a try, however, i have had beers of the style which I think are better (Cuvée Blue)."

"Dark brown and cloudy. Forms a large light tan colored head. Good retention. Minimal lacing. Smells beautiful with lots of dark malt, dark fruits and just a bot of colorist hops to round everything out. Taste is full of dark Malta, with a bit of raisin, toffee, and a mild fruitiness. Light sweetness. Full bodied, but very smooth. Mild bitterness. A very nice beer and about as good as it gets for the style."

"O: The flavor of this beer comes together nicely and presents itself as a single body of work. It’s not the most complex Belgian that I’ve had, but it is one of the better balanced and the flavors are savory."
"A decent beer, but not one that makes me sit up and take notice. It is good, but could use a bit more complexity. Goes down very easy considering the abv, and a good beer for a cold night."
""
"Overall: One of my new favorite Belgian Dark Ales. This is one hell of a beer, with dark fruity flavors and rich, but tamed, sweetness. Highly recommended."
"O- Im a big fan of the pumpkin beers, stouts, and IPAs so Belgians arent really on my radar, but if Im going to drink Belgian...it will be Chimay. I've had the red and blue label and enjoyed them both."
"Opaque raisin brown in color. Poured with a thick, frothy beige foam with excellent saying power. Dark, ripe fruit aroma with clove, a hint of banana, and an underlying sweet maltiness. Rich, aggressive carbonation with a rather dry finish. Delicate combination of dark fruit and spicy flavors throughout with hints of banana that occasionally show through. A very light dark roasted malted backbone fights through the carbonation. A touch of bitter hop flavor is introduced at the finish with a bit of booziness too."

""

"O-Nice beer which is perfect to sip during the evening. Feels like a treat. I think it's a really nice beer but there are examples of the style which are more fully evolved and fulfilled."

"Bought this as a birthday present to myself on my 25th birthday. Bought the 750ml bottle and enjoyed it all by myself with my wife watching on, laughing/being disinterested the drunker I got. It was a beautifully dark brew that intimidated me at first as I had not had much experience with Belgian strong dark ales. However, once I poured it into that goblet of mine, ohhh... the magic. Easily ranks as one of the best beers i've ever had, and probably ever will have. Very strong aroma of berries and cloves. Amazing warming sensation in the cheeks and the throat. Beautiful dark head to match the hue of the brew. If you are looking for cost-performance in a beer, this is the one. Treat yourself to it! I'm a Chimay believer for life!"
""
""
""
""

"Overall, this is a strong and elegant beer that makes an excellent treat at the end of the day."

"I love this beer! It was like cherries and strawberries with a smooth finish. It was my first trappist and I didn't know what to expect. I somehow thought I didn't like Belgian ales but I tried it with a bunch of other beers and it was my favorite BY FAR. Soooo tastey!!"
""
"o- Wonderful beer, i think yeast makes here a great job,the most important factor, i think."
""
"O - Pleasant, but less complex and robust than I'd hoped for. Wish I'd cellared it. I'll buy one more and try that. Otherwise a second one wouldn't bring me back."
""
""
""
"O - A good beer for the holidays or dessert but not my favoritve."
""
""
""

"I've been on a Trappist kick lately, so good. I am new to Chimay so I picked up a bottle based on the advice from the knowledgeable beer salesman who said this is his favorite. Poured from bottle to Duvel tulip. The beer pours a deep mahogany color with huge 3 finger tan colored head. Excellent retention and lacing. Bits of yeast sediment settle slowly. The aroma is nice, belgian yeast with it's characteristic clove aroma thought subtle is detectable. Thick malts, almost syrup like character. The taste is incredibly smooth: mild sweetness with mild bitterness, fig/plum fruitiness, thick caramel, hints of pepper. Very rich. Well crafted. I am amazed at how these Trappist brews hide their high alcohol so well. I could drink this all day long. Higher end of medium bodied and well carbonated. Very pleased with this beer. Highly recommended."
""
"Pours a chestnut brown, small cap of khaki froth, spotty retention. Scent leads with dark fruits and aromatic spices, some dark, sweet malts and dark bread also present. Taste leads with full notes of dark fruit, blends well with strong notes of clove, moderate sweetness and breadyness. Medium bodied, lightly bubbly. Overall, while many would rank this #1 or #2 on the Chimay scale, it falls down to #3 for me."
""
""
""
""
"Part smoke and mirrors, part real magic."
"O - An incredibly smooth, rich and flavorful beer. The best by far of what Chimay has to offer. What I can buy in stores here in the US tastes just as good as the one I had outside the abbey in Belgium. This is one of my top choices as a recommendation to friends who want to try a dark Belgian."
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a nice ale and surprisingly easy drinking. At the same time, it's hard to say exactly what makes it distinctive. A good brew nonetheless."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O: Outshine its little red brother, but I'm still not the biggest fan. Too much alcohol and not enough other flavors to really make it worth it, in my opinion."
""
"DOA"
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is one of the better beers I have had. There isnt a single bad quality to this beer and I almost mistake it for a quad. For sure will be buying this as much as I possibly can. Just amazing."
""

"After sampling some of the other Trappist ales, I can now detect some of the faults in this brew, however when compared to anything other than a Trappist, this brew is a cut above. If you have never tried a true Belgian ale or Trappist, I would recommend a Chimay Blue, a great intro into the world of fine ales!"

"This was the first Belgian beer I had months and months ago albeit in the 750 ml format. It blew my mind with all the carbonation and dark fruity taste. It doesn't seem as great now that I am a into “craft” beer as I originally thought, but it made me realize what beer can be and I will continue drinking this well into the future. A great all around beer."
""
""
"O: Yummy. You can tell it is higher in alcohol but its not overwhelming."
""
""
"Real nice, smooth beer. I prefer this one cold - fresh out of the fridge. Very thirst quenching at colder temps, with a very balanced, but muted flavor profile (fruits and alcohol). The alcohol dominates as the brew warms up, both in taste and aroma."

"O: Awesome strong Belgian dark ale. A nice sipping beer @ 9 % alcohol by volume."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"It poured nice dark brown with hints of red, nice smell of dark cherries, raisins and biscuity bread. Clean malt taste with a bit of fruit in the background. Very complex beer. Lots of carbonation in the mouth, which seemed to mask the alcohol (9% ABV), which worked well. Some citrus smell when it warmed up a bit. This is a world class beer that eveyone should try at least once."
""
""
""
"D - Nice simple BSDA. Nothing exceptional, but nothing off. Easy drinking, but that alcohol will sneak up on you."
""
""
""
"overall very enjoyable and easy to put down the hatch."
""
""
"Overall: About as much perfection as you can find anywhere. There is nothing off-putting about this beer, every aspect just burst free in your mouth in perfect harmony. I can not complain about anything, it exceeds any expectation I have and is well worth the $11 I paid for the 750. Just a priceless example of one of the best styles of belgian ales, easily a list topper for me."
""
""
""
"O - Very drinkable for a 9% ale, and what a pleasure it is too. A great, easy to find Belgian classic."
""
""
"Not a shock that I really enjoyed this beer. It is about time I put my enjoyment to paper (or the net for that matter)."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Taste-Spicy yeast, apple, pear, orchard fruits. Herbal hops dance in and out, more spicy yeast, white raisins and plum notes. Very effervescent and super smooth. Effortlessly drinkable despite hefty ABV. Almost ""gulpable", but take your time and enjoy this expertly crafted beer. Its complexity and balance make it a match for almost any fine meal. Truly a great beer."
""
""
"This is a beer that I could drink everyday. It pours a warm rich brown and the aroma smelled really nice. I couldn't quite get what it was but definitely got the belgian yeast smell. The taste is just great. Nice carbonation and very easy to drink. The mouthfeel is just smooth and silky. I love this beer!"
""
""
""
""
"O- a really good Trappist ale that is probably the par for the course, but nothing special IMHO. La Trappe Koningshoeven Quad is better than this. I buy this beer often as it is available often and is a really good beer for the style, but there are much better Trappist ales IMHO."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: a really nice beer, definitely couldn't drink more than one of these, has a great taste, scent, and appearance, mouthfeel is pretty good just the after burn in the throat brings it down for me"
""
"O-Outstanging beer. Truly one of the best in the world. Easily a good choice for holidays and special ocassions or if you just feel in the mood for a classy beer. This is a beer one can enjoy over and over again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: as mentioned I. The taste section, this brew is delicious. It is expertly balanced and features wonderful fruit notes without coming off as too sweet"
""
""
""
"Chimay Grande Reserve pours a hazy mahogany-brown with a thin rocky head that settles down to a thin lace. Sweet nose, features hints of maltiness, figs, brown sugar, candied sugar, and floral undertones; so much to enjoy here! A rich mouthfeel is joined by a good amount of carbonation. Dark flavors hit the pallet immediately, notably raisins, dark cherries and brown sugar, but are balanced well with the hp bitterness. Very complex beer, truly one of the GREAT beers of the world."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is my first trappistes style so maybe I'm just missing the whole point, but I am not too crazy about this one. Maybe I just got a bad bottle. I'll probably give it another shot one of these days, but @ $6 as bottle, it might not be until next Christmas."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - A beer the way its suppose to be. outstanding is the only word that seems fit. it has a absolutely everything you would expect from a Belgium Strong. Body, taste, smell, the list can go on but why do it? just go out and get it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - The strongest of the three ales produced by Bières de Chimay. I am a big fan of the Tripel, and the Dubbel is great, too. But the Grande Réserve is a step above. Boasting strong characteristics, it is no wonder that this beautiful Belgian Quad is held in such high regard under the ""Authentic Trappist Product"" name. A wonderfully complex beer that is mind-blowing every time. A personal favorite."
""
""
""
"This ale was my first stop in the Trappist family. I'm glad I tried this; I can't wait to try more in the Chimay lineup."

"Notes: I am really torn as to how I should rate this beer. It is the classic Belgian Dark Strong Ale, and yet, I struggled to enjoy it. Furthermore, the balance was lacking: the molasses sweetness completed overpowered the more subtle and delicate flavors: the esters, the phenols, the alcohols. And while I said that the finish was dry, it was hard to assess. The finish was big and almost cloying. The afterbirth was nice, whiskey-like as I said, but it took a long time to get there. This beer has the subtle flavors that are characteristic of this style, but the balance was not there. It took a deep patience to get to the subtle and complex symphony of flavors because of the misplaced child banging the cymbal of sweetness."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Drinking half off this bottle before even looking it up, I must say....I need more. Taste is truly better than what I wrote it's just that I have had beers that the taste is in your mouth after easting slices of cheese or other foods. That doesn't mean sh1t, Chimay has made nirvana in a bottle and from me to you...lust it as much as you can!"

"O - Classic Belgian. Has its fruity yeast esters and sold malt backbone. Good beer, but I swear I'm not super crazy about. Would drink again."
"Pours a rich dark brown into a Westmalle goblet. 2 fingered head but with a very gentle pour. Not much retention and little lacing. Smells like raisins or dates with some dark chocolate. Has a good roasted malt flavor. A little nutty. Nice carbonation. More carbonation than I expected after the pour. Very smooth and drinkable. Not my favorite of this style but very good."

"O: This is a very fine Belgian ale, not too strong or complex perhaps but very tasty and enjoyable."
"A very drinkable and definitely educational beer with the deep mahogany appearance, aromas of dark fruit and malt, and complex taste. Initial taste is sweet but well balanced between dark fruits and malts with yeast and earthy spices building. Finishes with a nice acidity that is clean and subdued. Opens up and becomes even smoother and complex as it warms. I highly recommend this beer to all ale lovers. It might be one of the most commercialized Belgium beers in the states but truly a great beer."
""
""
"Overall this isn't quite as complex as some other quads/Belgian strong dark ales - but I like that the sweetness is restrained and balanced by the dryness in the mouthfeel."
"My least favorite color of the Chimay rainbow but that's not saying much. Still a good beer."

"Chestnut brown colour, one finger of white/tan head, light lace but quite minimal. Smell is full of dark fruit, fig, dates and raisin, spicy notes as well, nutmeg?, dark breads and brown sugar as well. Taste is all fruit at first, raisins and figs, subtle spice bill, overripe plums, brown sugar with traces of yeast in the background, very complex stuff. Medium carbonation, full body, solid weight, good feel overall. Incredible stuff and near perfection, this is one I will keep coming back to as often as possible, outstanding."

"When I first tried Chimay Blue it was like nothing I've ever tasted. It has a special ""homemade"" flavour that I have come to associate with true trappist beers. The flavours are subtle; earthy yeast and roasted malts with gentle hops. Fresh from the bottle it has a lot of sweetness, and I get the impression that it is designed to be aged before it is enjoyed. For a stout packing 9% ABV it is very smooth drinking, and definitely one of my favourite beers."

"Overall Chimay Blue is a very good beer which I have had many times, but after sitting down and really think about it, it is not as good as others of the same style. That said it is still a must try."

"O: First time reviewing on BA. A fine example of a Belgian Ale."
"delicious beer, crazy how much it smells like a red wine or grape juice. dangerously drinkable. i wouldn't necessarily say it's a top 5, but it's for sure a world class brew."
"Overall it's an excellent beer, as was expected from Chimay."
"O: Tasty and enjoyable."
"http://abarwithnoname.wordpress.com"
"I've had this in two forms (the 750ml corked and the 12oz capped bottle) and have the 3L waiting for my graduation from seminary in 2012. The beer pours a murky brown color with an off white The smell is he least boozy of the trappists with a very sweet dried fruit smell with some yeast. The taste is smooth and crisp witha very sweet finish of sugary fruits. the smell is sugary and dried fruit. This is a great beer to share with new comers to the beer world. I've never had a person not like this heavy hitting beer."
"I had this fine ale from the small 11.2 bottles of the sample pack. The appearance was dark with ruby coming through as it held to the light.Smell was malty and little bit fruity. Taste was bitter and dry with a dark fruit after taste. This is a strong tasting ale but very good.I'd buy more if they cost less.Ha ha"
"The mouthfeel is exceptional. The taste is almost reminiscent of a wine. The dark fruits and sweetness shine through, with a bit of alcohol warmth on the back end. A damn fine beer. Maybe a bit above my level. I definitely like and respect it, but can't say it would be a regular in my fridge. It's a good winter warmer, for sure."
"This beer I believe is a bit high-brow for me honestly. I can recognize its incredible taste and mouthfeel, but to me this beer is up on a cloud and not as easily sensible/accessible as others, but is still an incredible beer and likley the best I have tasted."
"o: my favorite of the three that chimay has to offer."
"btw- vintage 5-11"
"No doubts one of the best representatives of Belgian beer."
"Mouthfeel is full bodied, nice carbonation and goes down great. Has some nice bite on the tongue. Overall, a great beer. Even more complexities come though as it warms and really makes you think with each sip. Definitely a great brew that every preson should have at least once."
"A good beer, for sure. I've had his tasting a touch better, but this is just fine as an example of this classic belgian strong ale. Underrated amongst beer geeks, for sure. I prefer Rochefort though...."
"Food match: Chimay Blue is so dry that it's a palate cleansing beer, i.e. game on when it comes to food. However I would recommend a meal befitting the quality (and cost) of this brew; caviar, lobster, truffles, foie gras, rare mushrooms that can only be purchased in Japan, baby panda's, etc."
"Finish-Light and sweet chocolate, some bitter, very nice beer with a very nice texture, high quality top notch stuff"
"O- Oh man what isn't to be said about this beer. It's simply magical and I wish it was readily available to me."
"Overall this is up there with the great ones. I could drink this all night if it weren't for the fact it might put me on my backside rather quickly."
"Full bodied and viscous, almost a bit syrupy with some residual sweetness. Smooth moderate carbonation."
"Notes: I had planned to cellar until the Holidays but couldn't resist so I took this cool Autumn day and popped the cork. So glad I tried this one."
"Medium bodied with good carbonation. Smooth and drinkable...watch the ABV! Very good...would have again...and again..."
"O - Very good, rich, complex, deep, and way too drinkable. Had to go back for another glass once the second bottle was opened."
"Outstanding. A must-have"
"O - I'm giving this one an exceptional overall score. I'd happily drink it again, but that could be more of a personal preference than a recommendation. From my experiences, drink this one in the 5-8 year range, or somewhere after the 11 year area and before the 25 year area once it gets better again."
"D. Good, but not phenomenal. I'll have to put up a newer vintage review at some point."
"Smells sweet and malty. Pretty light and nice on the nose. Tastes light and maybe a touch fruity. Malty, sweet, the mouthfeel is a bit weak. But tastes really nice."
"O: Another great Trappist beer. Love it"
"D: im not finding this ridiculously complex, but extremely clean. solid flavors. i find the very strong carbonation actually hinders some of the more nuanced flavors. i enjoy having this bottle from start to finish to note the flavor and aroma differences as the bottle warms and the CO2 escapes."
"D-Wow, this one surprised me. I haven't ever really loved BSDA's/Quad's, but this one is very subtle and delicious."
"I can die a happy man having enjoyed this."
"D ~ Drink this about once a year & it never ceases to amaze. Pairs very well with food and is very satisfying at any occassion. A great intro to Belgian Darks."
"Brown in appearance with a strong foam. The smell is, well, very nice. The smell is rich and promising. This is very nice on the mouth, overall the taste is good. We found this beer to be a nice surprize. With 9% ABV this drinks more like a barley wine. A nice drinking beer never the less. Will go well with beef and gravy.."
"Opened with distinct rush of carbonation and pleasant yeasty aroma. I poured this rather gingerly to NOT unduly disturb the yeast sediment at bottom of bottle, into the chalice provided. Pours a lovely ruddy brown,hazy due to being unfiltered. (Reminds me of some of my own homebrew!) The monks are right about using the chalice, the head lasts a fair amount of time, delicately lacing the glass. The taste improves with every sip, being fruity and yeasty,very complex; you can discern the alcohol in this , but pleasantly. Highly enjoyable!"
"O - I really enjoyed Chimay Blue. It's an outstanding example of the Belgian Trappist style ale. It is very sweet, but in a complex and refreshing way. Simply put, it is delicious and you won't be disappointed. I would definitely recommend this beer and I look forward to having it again."
"O: My first Belgian Strong Dark Ale and first Chimay. Nothing odd about this ale, very complicated taste, refreshing mouthfeel, sweet smell, and beautiful appearance. I enjoyed drinking this beer very much."
"Overall: Wonderful beer. Lots of bubbles, smooth, no hint this is a 9%'er."
"Overall: Great balance of bitter and sweet. Extremely complex. Of course I'll have another one when I get the chance."
"O: Wow. I feel like a complete man after trying this beer. Life is good."
"A wonderful bouquet of butterscotch, toffee, sweet malts, dark fruit and candy sugar belies a tart, twangy flavor that is nevertheless wonderfully complex. Noticeable alcohol warmth on the palate. Full-bodied and chewy. Would go well with some nice Blue cheese."
"O - Very nice, strong beer. Great for unwinding if you've had a bad day like I have today."
"UPDATE: Tried a 1.3 year old 330ml bottle earlier, and while I don't think the other two by Chimay are superior when aged, this is completely true for Chimay bleue. The aromas resemble a thick raspberry-strawberry drink like nothing else, and the drinking experience is far maltier and yeastier, yet extremely smooth to the point of extreme relaxation. Highly recommended aging 750ml bottles of this for a year or two - you won't regret it."
"The mouthful is probably what did it for me to make it as interesting as it was. The taste is easily something I need to try again and again to taste everything which this drink has to offer. This beer was quite nice and I would definitely buy it again over the selection that is offered it my town."
"A world class beer, although it's the most expensive beer I've ever reviewed given it's exceptionally high cost per unit alcohol volume. The cost is so high that it's almost prohibitive to drink considering the competition. Like most Belgian Strong Dark Ales, it's very malty and pours a muddy burgundy-brown with a thick creamy head. It smells great - like candy sugar, raisin, plums and spice. Up to this point it's about perfect, but on the first sip things start to go downhill a bit. The complex blend of flavor is somewhat disjointed, and the lack of carbonation makes it feel somewhat watery. Unlike a rich malty doppelbock, this doesn't feel much like a meal in a glass, but more like a seasonal cider. It's definitely sweet, spicy and delicious, but in my opinion there are better beers given the prohibitive cost. Try St. Bernardus Abt 12, The Sixth Glass or Aventinus Eisbock to get more flavor and spend less duckets."
"Certainly not as bad as I recall which means I’m becoming more and more tolerant to these odd flavors. That said one should expect more based on the hype, cost, and well the reputation of Trappest beers. Oh and just a bit of advice to Chimay, this beer should be served in 6-7 oz bottles. This 11.2 oz bottle is far too big."
"O - Overall, not what I expected but definitely still good. Maybe not the strong dark ale I would go to regularly."
"O - One of my favorites. It never gets tiring."
"Cheers!"
"Overall -- simply outstanding."
"Of course, this is strong, but there's a reason that this is a classic. This is so flavorful that it would pair well with most dinner foods or would be solid enough to savor by itself. As a beer, it makes the transition from dinner to dessert well and proves that a great beer can be subtle and unchanged throughout the ages. I look forward to having this again!"
"Overall / Drinkability: A beer for sipping and savoring, but I think it would be good with the right meal. Interesting, but not my favorite Belgian Dark Strong Ale, nor my favorite Trappist ale. The tart finish I found a bit annoying by the end, maybe even a little bit too dominating over the rest of the flavors. Sadly a bit disappointing for me but still interesting to try and tease out the different flavors. Oh well - to each their own."
"O: A very good and widely available Trappist. If I need a beer to go to, this one is always good for a try. If you prefer a Rochefort, or even a St. Bernadus, those beers are better, but harder to find. This one is worth a try when you can find it all over and for cheap."
"O: It is no wonder that this is one of the most respected and widely distributed beers on the planet. It is extremely drinkable and very enjoyable. This is my favorite of the Chimay offerings. Good stuff."
"Superb in the end. The initial cloying sensation is resolved. A great sipping beer."
"O-I llok forward to trying the white and red labels as well. But I prefer a darker ale, something that grabs you, and this Trappist answered that call. Very good!"
"O: For a beer that shares the great smells I associate with world-class English barleywines and doppelbocks, Chimay Grand Réserve certainly disappoints me in other categories. It is not bad, per se, but definitely not impressive. "
"O: Glad to see that Chimay Blue was very much a fundamentally different beer from the Red. Though it wasn’t excessively flavorful, it sure was a really good drink, and one that I might just have again (maybe with some age, next time)."
"This pours a yeast fill hazy dark tea brownish color with a large tan head which foams up but then quickly dissipates down to a thin layer. The smell is of yeast esters, slightly sweet, some fruit (grapes). Feel is medium and with high carbonation. The taste is pretty sweet, lots of fruit and sugars, this is a very sweet beer, but its also very good (but I've had it many times and know what to expect). Overall this is a fantastic desert beer and one I've gotten many times."
"O – A good beer, very tasty. What I don’t understand is; why didn’t I buy this beer any sooner? It’s a fantastic alternative for the much harder to get Westvleteren 8 or 12."
"Certainly my least favorite of the Chimay labels, although Belgian Strong Dark Ales are not my cup of tea. Coming out of this though, this is certainly one of the better beers in the style and I did quite enjoy this. I couldn't do more than one glass at a time but it's one to try."
"I was never won over by the fresh bottles of Chimay Grande Réserve that I sampled in the past, but this three-year-old bottle was a totally different experience. If you have the space (and the patience) I would definitely advise cellaring a case of these and sampling one periodically."
"O - Very good. I love this style and this represents it perfectly."
"Maybe I re-review with a fresh bottle. I much prefer it fresh. Yum."
"O- Sat on this for 7 months. Had another quite some time ago. Loved it, did not rate it...at the time. One of the best beers I have tried in a long time. Very difficult for me to describe. Guess I am not worthy? Ha ha ha..."
"Overall - My first true Belgian beer. It was good but not the greatest."
"A sweet, spicy masterpiece. There's a reason it's a classic."
"O: A complex beer and a good beer. Not the hugest fan of Belgian's but they are growing on me. Will definitely give this a try again."
"O: High praise for this one, does it live up? Yes it does, it is a delicious beer, and easy drinking. I don't get too much alcohol in the taste, the flavor is awesome and the carbonation is really nice too."
"This is an outstanding beer. I tried to nurse an 11.2 oz bottle through a pre-season football game. It didn't last for the first half!!!"
"O = I think this is a great beer. Top 5 in my book. seen it a hundred times but didnt buy always went with the Rochefort 8 or 10..this time i got it and was well rewarded. cannot drink more than a couple but sooo worth the investment."
"O: Always love a good belgian ale. Not the best that I have had but close (in love with the Trappist Westvletern 12...and like the Abt 12 more as well)"
"Appearance is a dark brown color with some slight orange to red highlights when held to light and a dense off-white billowy head. The head fades fairly quickly and leaves no lacing. Dark fruit scents - plum, fig, raisin, and grape - are pleasing to the nose, but a bit on the weak side. A dark fruit sweetness carries through in the taste, along with a bit of nuttiness and molasses, but it's not overly sweet. Alcohol taste is barely noticeable. Nice complexity, and very enjoyable."

"I was going to bow and scrape before this beer, loudly proclaiming ""I'm not worthy!"" until I popped the cap and it began to foam up through the neck. This is MUCH too precious a beer to allow to go to waste and so I sprang into action, decanting it into my Westmalle glass so that I could stop the foaming. I created a dense finger of light-tan head with excellent retention. Color was a deep brown with cola highlights, but it was too dark in its color to be able to gauge clarity. I could still see the lees in the bottom of the bottle, so I would guess that I did okay. The nose on this beer is worth the price of admission! I have stated many times over that I am a self-avowed hophead and do not generally like malty beers, but this is an exception. The initial waft is of dried dark fruits, followed by a healthy smack of alcohol heat and then chocolate and nuts. I could sit with my nose buried in the glass for a while, but a) you get the idea, b) there are plenty of other, better reviews and c) I am anxious for a sip. Mouthfeel was full and creamy with an initial sugary/malty sweetness and some big heat, followed by caramel and toffee, then dried dark fruit and finally a touch of yeasty must. Finish brought the heat then settled back for a slightly dry aftertaste. Right after that, the mellow began to set in and I felt sleepy, very sleepy. My my, what are they doing at Scourmont?"
"A slight alcohol finish closes this one out. A delicious and perfectly representative of the finest abbey ales."
"A very nice Belgian dark ale, and after trying I can see why it is loved both aged and fresh."
"Wow. This is one hell of a beer. Reviewed freshly bought from Monoprix, un-aged. An aggressive pour yield plentiful head, which dissipates rather quickly. Dark brown body that allows some light through. The nose gives hints of caramel and slight smokiness. Of course on the flavor, said notes of caramel and smokiness come through, in addition to a slight nutty flavour. Mouth feel is lively, complete but not overly heavy. Overall, the complete package sets this beer apart from others. Truly unique and world class Trappist product. Surely it gets knocked for its popularity and availability compared to some of the other Trappist products, but the beer really speaks for its own cause. Highly recommended."
"O: can't say there is a a trappist I don't like, and this does not disappoint, Wonderful!"
"Overall Impression- While this is very rich and malty, this is my favorite of the Chimay Reserves! I have been looking to enjoy this again (since I haven't seen it in stock in St. Louis), and what a perfect chance to enjoy in CA! A great Dark Belgian Strong Ale to split with a beer friend."
"Overall, this was an exceptional and singular experience. This is a really really good beer. If you can bring yourself to do so, put one on the shelf and leave it there for a few years. It's worth the self-restraint. Yummy."
"This is a strong, but very good beer. Very well rounded and the moment you taste it, you’re hit with an awesome combination of tastes. Pricey, but definitely worth it if you come across a bottle."
"O - As always, a standard go to. Really nice flavors and aromas that make this one such a drinkable beer. Might try cellaring a few of these."
"Overall just a wonderful, balanced beer."
"Very enjoyable Belgian brew. I remember some drunk dude at one of my local shops telling me about how great this beer was and I just looked at him and said ""Yeah I know..."" I guess he figured that a 22 year old wouldn't have tried that beer yet. Needless to say, I had and it was very good. The beer poured out as bubbly brown color with some red highlights. The smell of the beer is a bit on the earthy side with some sweet dark fruits on the nose and of course a hefty amount of yeast. The taste is a little metallic at first but that fades as it warms up. The dark fruits are subtle here but there is a slight sweetness from them, it's a little boozy, and has some spice in the back end too. The mouthfeel of the beer is a little thin but had enough carbonation to keep this one interesting. Overall this is enjoyable, I like to order it on occasion but not often."
"This was truly a treat with quite a bit of sediment in the bottom of the last pour. For $15 at a restaurant, this was a great buy and a great treat."
"O: Overall this is a solid beer, with a good following. I find other beers in the style to rank higher than this, but does have very good quilities. Great gateway into Belgians."
"O: Rather disappointed with this. People rave that this is amazing, but I've had much better."
"Overall I'm honestly a little disappointed. I've heard of this as an A+ type of beer - world class and loved by many - but found it to just be ""good."" I wonder if a larger corked bottle is a different experience. I also imagine this beer might be a little different after it warms up a bit after the chill wears off."
"O- considered one of the wrolds best beers, and for good reason. the alcohol only adds to the overall flavour, and although there are beers with more complex flavours, the beauty of this is that all the flavours flow and work togeher very very well."
"DRINK (4/5) Drinkability is medium - too heavy and flavorful for a session, but well balanced and complex. A great drink all-in-all."
"O: I thought I would like this beer a lot more. As a positive, it is easily drinkable, but I was surprised by how average this beer seemed to me; each element seemed subdued. I am not a Belgian expert (I do like Boulevards BBQ and Grand Tetons Coming Home) so I will revisit someday and hope that my palette has matured. Until then, Chimay White seems to be my favorite of the three."
"O- Very rich and complex. Sometimes hard to describe all the flavors. One of my favorite beers and perfect representation of the style."
"Great beer!"
"Don't know why it took me so long to review it."
"Overall: Great beer, had it many times fresh and aged. Will only disappoint if you drink it after a Rochefort 10 or St Bernardus Abt."
"Overall: It has been years since I last had the Chimay Blue. Why did I wait so long? This beer has plenty of character, and is very drinkable. When drinking the 750mL, watch out for the sneaky 9% ABV. Also, careful with the cork; I only needed a very slight twist and the cork exploded out with a very loud and forceful ""pop"". I am pretty sure it would have bounced off the ceiling."
"O - A very good Belgian in my books...I tend to lean away from the style but I could not pass up the opportunity to try such a coveted beer...after reading previous reviews, I would love to try an aged version as this one was pretty fresh"
"O - Exceptional drink. I always pass this by and the price is a bit restrictive for a single, but this is definitely something I will pick up on occasion. Highly enjoyable."
"Smooth, creamy and extremely tasty. By far an absolutely fantastic beer. A joy to drink. We bought many a bottle in Brussels at the local grocery store. Not pricey at all. My pals thought they died and went to heaven. For they have never had a premium world famous brew before this."
"O- I'm going to admit, my expectations were maybe too high for this beer. However, it ultimately is tasty and quite easy to drink. It's the most mild of this style I've yet to try. With the 9% ABV, this could deceptively turn into a session beer (albeit rather pricey)."
"From the wire-caged and corked 25 fl. oz. bottle stamped L10-611. Sampled on June 27, 2011. I have been meaning to get around to this one. It pours a cloudy dark, caramel brown with a thin tan head. The aroma is alive with dark cherry or grape-like fruits, figs, yeast, and a bit of alcohol punch. The body is full. While there is a bit of a sharp alcohol bite there are also plenty of Belgian candy sugars to sweeten it up and balance it right out. What more can I say? This is the Belgian Strong Ale that everyone strives to match."
"Warm brown with a great head and laces perfectly. Smells of rum raisin and dark fruit. Good dark malty flavor with raisin and dark cocoa. Very smooth and full bodied mouthfeel. Plenty Great balance of sweet and bitter. Very complex but very drinkable flavor. Wonderful."
"O: This is pretty good; however, I don’t like grape and there is a lot of grape hear. I would definitely recommend it if you like grape, and not if you don’t."
"D/O- 9% abv? Wow, wouldn't believe it. Could drink a few glasses if permitted. A real treat."
"taste wonderful the alcohol wasn't to strong in this beer ."
"O: Love this beer. Always a good introductory beer to give people who have yet to try the Belgian Strong Dark Ale style. What I love most about this beer is the feeling in the belly afterward. It is the drink equivalent of a comfort food meal like ribs on the bbq along with some garlic mashed potatoes."
"Finally, i think there are really more interesting beers in this type."
"O-A good beer but not as complex or interesting as some other Belgian Strong ales"
"There is a ton of carbonation on the front of the palate, but it dies quickly into a sweet treat. The aftertaste is subtle, but begs for another sip. The second drink isn’t as good, but it still leaves some huge sweet notes on the tongue. It’s pretty solid, but not sure it lives up to all the hype. There is another Chimay beer on this list; hopefully that one is better than this on. Bottoms up people!"
"D: I'd order another and buy again. No sign of the 9% ABV."
"O- I found it quite enjoyable, although I do prefer the taste of Victory's Golden Monkey when it comes to Belgian dark ales."
"re-tasted the 2008 1.5 liter bottle and man this beer proves that with some age this beer can just melt on your palet."
"O- I simply waited too long to drink this beer. one of my top 5 belgians. thanks to imperial gout for sharing his 750. it paired very well with the filet. I have another bottle in the fridge I can't wait to crack open. I will probably hoard it though....as I think I can manage the entire bottle over a few hours."
"I have had this beer a couple of times before, and remembering enjoying it more than I am now. Still very good, but not the gem that I recalled. Maybe either the bottle or I is off tonight!"
"O: Overall a good brew, but not my favorite of the belgians."
"This is a special treat to get once in a while when you have extra money to burn, but a little bit too expensive to justify having as a 'usual suspect' in the fridge. If possible, I recommend cellaring for a couple years to dry out the excessive sweetness, that is when it really hits its prime."
"Highly recommend, especially with a nice meal, or post-meal."
"Overall: One of the best beers I've had, and certainly one of my favorites. There really is very little I can say bad about it, every thing seems to be in perfect balance."
"It's interesting how so many reviewers, both on this site and in reference material, taste different things in this beer. Here's what I got. Poured a massive ecru colored head which settled to lacing and traces. Color is a deep russet, almost cider-like. Smell has malt, raisins, figs, or basically dark dried fruits. Taste has more of the same and it's quite rich. There's an acidic zing which persists in one of the longest lasting finishes I've ever had in a beer. Clearly this deserves the world class status it holds. Of course I'd prefer if it were cheaper. And what I don't get from it, which I've seen other reviewers claim, is plum, pear, honey, or bubblegum. Say what?"
"O: Very delicious. Very pricey, but very delicious."
"Overall a very, very good beer. Beers like this really uphold the Trappist reputation for amazing complex brews. With any luck I should be getting my hands on some more soon."
"O - Impressed with this one as I had anticipated. Definitely a staple that I will return to from time to time."
"O- This beer is sweet and rich with a nice balance of spice and dark fruit flavors."
"Mouthfeel, again, is crisp and dry. Carbonation is active and contributes to the crispness at the end. The boozy sweetness creates a nice coating in the mouth and on the lips. Overall a very pleasurable Belgian Strong Dark Ale and one of my favorite beers overall."
"O- Overall, a very respectable, very drinkable beer. I have one that I'm going to put in the cellar until I can't stand to keep it down there anymore, and I'll see what it turns into."
"Like for many this was my gateway to the wonderful world of both the Trappist beers and Belgian strong dark ales / quads in general. It’s a very good beer; however, for the money there are so many better beers. In fact it is at the bottom of the Trappist SDA’s, which is not an insult as it is the least of a series of great beers."
"O - It's a good beer. I have others in this style that I have preferred though."
"M - Good, balanced carbonation that sparkles all the way to the finish. Medium-to-thick bodied with a drier finish."
"Classic belgian. Pours a cloudy mahogany with a light head. Lots of complexity to the flavor. Blueberries, plum, fig and toffee are all present. Light to Medium body beer, dry with slight sweet malt presence in the finish that balances phenolics and alcohol very very well. Exciting on the tongue with lots of carbonation, as to be expected for this style of beer. Little to no hop presence, dark fruits and esters to the aroma."
"Pours a murky dark brown color with a 1 inch bone colored head that fades to a film on the top of the beer. No lacing whatsoever. There is lots of sediment floating around in this beer, which I assume is the yeast. Smells of dark fruits (especially raisins), brown sugar, caramel, and malty bread notes. Taste is lots of dark fruits (again with the raisins), caramel/brown sugar, and some malt. Beer has a good carbonation level and is bubbly and crisp. Overall, this is a great BSDA and another great beer from Chimay."
"Mouthfeel is thick. Not chewy, but thick - full bodied for sure. And as for drinkability, it's a high for me. I'd say that this is one to take your time on. Very drinkable, but savor this. Prosit!!"
"Certainly good though."
"Poured into a Chimay goblet. Cloudy medium brown with red reflections. Sediments pour out and settle to bottom. Small light tan head with a small eruption at the center that persists. The aroma is boozy rum soaked fruit cocktail of berries (earthy blueberries and raisins/currants) and bananas. Clove and banana come out with warming. The taste is rum fruit. The 9% alcohol blends well. Tasty."
"Overall, great flavors mixed with balance and mass enjoyability. Thank you Mr. Monk"
"The only complaint is the huge carbonation, it really ends up drinking like foam instead of liquid but that is minor problem because the flavors are nice. I would be interested to try this on tap."
"Deep and hazy auburn pour with a sturdy head that does not dissapear easily. Very sweet aromas of fruit, apple, sweet malt. Sweet taste with a cider tartness. The medium bodied brew is smooth and in no way aesthetically unpleasant. This is a fantastic beer whose alcohol warms in the winter and whose malt fruitiness refreshes in the spring and summer. Further the cider notes make it a great room temperature brew in the late fall. I have tried this beer across many different meals and all of the seasons and have yet to be dissappointed."
"pour is nice and belgian frothy. a murky brownish red with about a finger and a half of head but unforeseen retention. nose of typical beer straw, toasted malt and plums preserves. a bouquet delicate palate with subtleties. palate that is extremely dry in a characteristic way i've never really thought about before. a sweetness that isn't syrupy. a tad husky. a tad grainy. plum, grape and fig qualities. herbal bitter finish. lingering prune... for several minutes. but not coating the tongue but hints. this is an old bottle."
"There are hints of sweetness that may suggest figs or raisens something a little more surgery than your typical fruit. All in all I would search high and dry for this beer and loved every minute I had while drinking it."
"(11.2oz bottle). Pours a cloudy caramel color with red hues and khaki head. Aroma of caramel, port wine, raisins, and candied sugar. Taste is sweet but not cloying with a touch of bitterness. Full bodied with a sticky texture. Finish is slightly bitter and smooth. This beer is, simply, world class."
"D: Nearly perfect. A Fantastic ale."
"O-This is what a beer should be. A complex mix of flavors that usually never disappoint, very drinkable for a beer of its style. Just a fantastic beer all around."
"O - Definitely a top quality dark Belgian Ale and a great example of the style. Full flavoured offering which wasn't overly sweet and whose ABV was well controlled. Most definitely on the rotation for Belgians in the future."
"To be honest, this is one of the best beers I've tried so far. If served in Chimay glass, the beer is a beauty to look at. Nice white head, which (mostly) lasts 'till the last sip and a dark, cloudy brown color, if put towards the light, a little reddish. Smell is nice, but not very strong... some sweetness, a little bit of yeast and dry fruit, maybe... Taste? Awesome. I think this beer masks the alcohol really well, as I can't taste it much, a little bit of bitternes at the end, very smooth. Quite a lot of carbonations at the start, warming feel at the end. A decent slow-sipping beer that's perfect for special occasions or, for the lovers of the type, even everyday beer. I strongly recommend it! Cheers."
"For the presentation (and price), this was a bit of a letdown IMO. Wouldn't say it's crap, but I've had better."
"Overall a pretty good beer. I enjoyed it."
"Overall- Its hard to stop at one glass, the 75cl bottle offers more than that, so I couldn't see anyone stopping at one. Behind the smooth taste, and slightly carbonated flow, its easy to throw back a few of these and forget about the 9.0 alc which is greatly disguised with the smooth and rich taste. I would highly recommend picking up a bottle."
"Overall: A fine beer. It gets better as it warms (both itself and the drinker) and practically cries out for a second glass (fortunately, I have a second glass!). If you are looking for a fine beer that's relatively easy to obtain, Chimay (especially the Grande Reserve) is a great beer to turn to."
"D - An amazing Trappist Ale. This is not a beer for those who wish to chug back a brew, but you knew that. No, this is a beer for sipping, an excellent beer for special occasions, for celebrations. A fantastic high quality beer that is complex, delicious and divine. Overall, one of the best beers I've ever had, and one of the best beers...period."
"D: I would say this is a great intro beer to Belgian beers. It's higher in ABV, but it's hardly noticeable. The beer itself is very complex but also very well balanced. Overall a very good beer."
"this is fantastic. there is so much going on that I can't describe it all. just try it, you'll like it!"
"A staple in beer."
"I like this beer"
"Drinkability- Very good, I would love to have it again."
"Overall I really liked this one. it had a rich flavor which made it a joy to sip on."
"D: Delicious and a great representation of the style. A classic (though I think some BAs think giving Chimay and automatic A/A+ earn them credibility somehow)."
"RJT"
"Well this one must need some aging, I think it's too young. Maybe at least another year on this and it might be much better. Quite disappointing."
"O (D) - I really love this beer. It's excellent in so many ways. A desert island beer for sure."
"-The Monk, Brussels"
"overall - a good beer, but I was expecting more."
"I've been drinking this one for years, in both 11 oz and 750 ml bottles, young and aged. Finally getting around to reviewing this one. Pours a nice mahogany color, with a creamy topping of meringue-like foam. Aromas of booze soaked fruits, brown sugar and Belgian yeast. Rich, thick and full bodied, with flavors of brown sugar, Belgian yeast, chocolate, booze and raisins."
"Despite the high ABV and the obvious heat from it, it's pretty tame for 9%. In addition, you've got the bite from the carbonation. It's an intense beer, but never is overpowering in any way and because of that, actually goes down pretty well."
"Good drinkability; this is a great beer, comparable with other Chimay Beers."
"Dr: Hides its ABV very well. Easily downable repeatedly, but not special."
"O - Not what I was expecting in a beer, reminds me of a wine, but very good. Will buy again."
"Overall - I love this beer. Best trappist i've had since the Rochefort 10."
"Have a 2007 Jeroboam of this I can't wait to try. This pour was from a 750ml into a Chimay chalice. Everything you could want and ask for of a strong dark ale. Gorgeous contrast of the dark brown body with the white lacy head. Intensely complex smell of fruits and spices. Taste follows suit with the most incredible balance of flavors. Somehow, even with its complexity and 9% abv this is still so easy to drink, but I wouldn't dare do anything but sip this. Overall, as close as it gets to perfect."
"D: Almost too high not the type of beer that you would want to put back quickly but is so well made that it could be done easily. But at ~10% ABV you would not get thru too many."
"I don't know if the blue label is my favorite of the Chimay line but it is very, very good."
"Overall: This is one of my personal top 5 beers. If I were rich, I would drink this on a semi-regular basis. Its a sipper, but drinks real easy for the abv. Will revisit this next time I get a 75cl bottle (or even the magnum!)"
"D. Certainly NOT the beer it was a few years back when Brother Thomas was in charge of brewing, there's a lot of complexity lacking in there these days. For me, this can no longer be classed as a 'classic' Trappist beer."
"A wine snob would call it complex with a long on the palate finish. A little too strong on the alcohol, but it had a good caramel flavor. A very nice, long laster with a mouthful of taste. It will definitely age well in the cellar. Loved it."
"O - Yeah, this is really good. Since it is generally easy to get in the states, it is a must buy for those looking for a high end belgian ale."
"As the dense head would suggest, this beer is very creamy, very heavy, and, to my delight, very dry. Its so heavy I think I'll only need one of these for now, but I will definitely drink another when I see it. Grande Réserve is a wonderful beer."
"Definitely an ale that will remain in my home on a permanent basis."
"My first 5.0!"
"An exceptional ale. This is my favorite of the Chimays, so I made it my birthday brew this year. Pours dark brown with a creamy fizzy head. Smells of dark fruits and belgian yeast with a hint of alcohol due to the ABV. Moderate and tingly mouth feel. Taste is complex, with dark fruits, candy, chocolate, belgian sugars, phenols, and very sweet and mild hop character. This one is too easy to drink for the ABV - be careful."
"D: Really good. I can't wait to try one with some age on it."
"Pours a dark brown w/ a two finger caramel head. The smell is that of fruit, clove, malt, and alcohol, w/ a little rum mixed in. The taste is fantastic- rum soaked fruit, w/ an earthy-ness, alcohol, and malt. Mouthfeel is nice- very creamy, smooth, w/ an alcohol burn for the aftertaste. I don't mind the alcohol at all, in fact, I think it adds to the overall taste of this beer. Drinkability is great. 9% ABV isn't overwhelming, and this beer goes down pretty easily. Not my favorite Belgian, but the first 'world-class' Belgian that I had. I've had this beer quite a lot, and it's a go-to beer that's gotten many of my friends into Belgian beer. World class all the way..."
"If I had a million dollars, I would drink 2-4 bottles with every meal."
"D: Not hard to have multiple glasses of this; this may not have been my favorite Belgian strong dark ale, but a good, enjoyable beer nonetheless."
"Poured a rich medium to dark brown with a small off-white foamy head that was fully diminishing and had fair lacing. The aroma was of roasted malts, a mild flowery hops and a light scent of a sweet yeast with notes of dried fruit. It tasted slightly bitter-sweet in the beginning with a hint of raisons and finished moderately sweet and malty and had a slight alcohol tinge at the end with the flavor only lasting a short time. Mouthfeel was medium in body and very creamy yet oily in texture. Overall a fantastic/outstanding brew with one hell of a kick. One of my favorites, but don’t drink too many!!!"
"Comments- Not really a strong dark ale kind of guy, but I have had others that I liked better. I would probably drink one of these again if given to me but I would not look to buy one. I think Chimay has done better with their Red and White offerings."
"Poured into a chalice, about half an inch of head that vanished pretty quickly, leaving pretty much no lacing. Was trying it for the first time, after hearing such good things. Did not quite like it on the first taste, but after about the 3rd sip I got it. Nice fruity taste, plums and currants. Yeasty and good. A bit sweet, almost brandy-like. Smells as good as it tastes. A hint of clove to the smell. Good, but I am thinking it would be great with some more age on it. Will definitely keep my other bottles cellared for a while. Looking forward to trying it again in six months to a year."
"D: Very Drinkable! Respect this brew. Lots of appreciation to the monks that did this one. (Especially nice to drink out of the Chimay goblet!)."
"As my first trappist ale, I can definitely say that I've set my standards high for myself."
"M/D: This beer does not seem to be well balanced at all, the flavor profile was dominated by two things, pick up subtleties was nearly impossible for me. There did not seem to be any complexities with this beer. And the alcohol was way to present throughout the tasting. Hopefully a bottle with some age would do this beer some good."
"High drinkability. Slightly sweet but not overpowering. Dry afterward."
"Serving type: 750ml bottle poured into snifter"
"The CPJ"
"Bottled 05/10. Pours a dark, murky, reddish brown with a large tan head. The scent on this beer is wonderful! Plenty of dark fruit, molasses, spice, bread, chocolate, and some alcohol. Taste is exactly how it smells. Initially, I get Belgian yeast flavors with delightful spices and dark fruits. Then I get some bread notes with sweet molasses and a hint of dark chocolate. Finishes with more dark fruit. Alcohol is well hidden in this extremely complex beer. Mouthfeel is rich and creamy with a nice dry finish. Drinkability is high. This is an amazing beer that I love being able to have easy access to."
"I must say I liked the Red one better, it was lighter and has less roast to it. This has tons of roasty syrupy malts which add a heavier body and take away from the drinkability. That being said this is still an amazing brew. From the minute you take a sip till it hits your stomach it tastes phenomenal. This may replace my Winter Warmer favorites. I really can't wait to get my hands on some Chimay White Tripel. Support your Monks and go buy this now!!! You won't be sorry, some great tastes and great conversation. Stay thirsty my friends!!!"
"D- I like the beer, but I set my glass down I can't help but feel that it's overrated. Neither my favorite beer from Chimay or my favorite BSDA."
"D- Very drinkable. No complaints at all."
"D- this is a exceptional beer. i think they should serve this at wedding instead of champagne. All the flavors blend soo nicely. If you have not had thi beer go find it immedietly. You wont be dissapointed"
"D- This is a great drinker. Goes down smooth, gives you some flavors. Great belgian style ale"
"Drinkability is above average, the flavors and texture give this beer a pretty unique quality for me and this beer is certainly out of my comfort zone, that said i definitely want more!"
"Nothing else to say. there is a reason why this perfect Belgium style beer sells so well, It's mighty good."
"poured from a a 750 caged and corked into a gobe glass. his beer pours a dark brown with a small light tan head. the smell is bready and yeasty. the flavor is dark fruits and spices. the mouthfeel medium to full bodied mouthfeel with decent carbonation, overall a very good example of the style and it has good drinkability"
"i enjoyed this froma 750ml bottle at my house. poured into a goblet glass which really helped capture the superior aroma of this beer. this was my first experience with a belgian strong dark ale and it opened new worlds for me. i always come back to this beer when i want something complex and tasty in the belgian dark category."
"D: this one is a must, definitely outstanding"
"D: Very drinkable and paired nicely with my dinner. There just wasn't enough flavor as the meal completely overwhelmed this beer."
"D: Very high with this beer. Being passing up this beer at the store for some time and I have been very impressed!!! Very good beer, will be coming back to this one."
"A bit thin on the tongue, with the ample carbonation pretty aggressive. Definitely not as sweet as some other Belgian strong dark ales or quads that I've tried, which helps make it more drinkable, as the alcohol is just a light warmth in your throat."
"D: This is one of those beers that you know you shouldn't drink too fast but have a difficult time holding back. SO easy to drink, but very dangerous at 9%"
"D: This beer has fairly high drinkability. The alcohol is not really noticeable and the flavors are complex and interesting."
"D: If I could drink this all day I would be one happy man, but a very drunk one at that. Everything is perfect here!"
"A relatively boring Belgian Strong Dark Ale. I'd been holding off on trying this for some time as I'd held it as the gold standard, but this beer disappoints on almost every level. While this is still a terrific, delicious, and accessible beer, it's reputation appears greater than its merit."
"D - not bad. An easy to find Belgian dark. But dig a little deeper and you can find better."
"Given that I am new to the Trappist beers I may have to come back to this review at some point in the future. I am not, however, new to Belgian beers and this is one fine example of a good strong Belgian Ale. Undoubtedly worth a try by anyone who loves beer."
"D: Very drinkable, but beware the treacherous ABV."
" A beer tasting, which matures in fine style in the cellar where it is reminiscent of good Madeira wine. A standard"
"Drinakability - Great drinkability sweet to spice ratio is very well balanced, the alc is hardly noticeable, and I paid $9.99 for a 750ml bottle."
"D: love this beer and if I can get it with a free glass I'll never pass it up but I would defiantly pick up a bomber of this if I saw it in a heart beat."
"Drinkability: Very easy to drink, in spite of the high alcohol content, which is hidden well by the complex, sweet and spicy flavors. The only downside is the price, nearly $5 for such a tiny bottle!"
"Drinkability is very high and the alcohol is really only noticed in the warming effect. Mouthfeel is creamy and smooth; medium bodied and has a somewhat dry finish."
"Re-reviewed November 13, 2011: part of the QuadShowdown, 2006 vintage. Nose of overripe grapes, sweet brown sugars, lightly vinous and slightly funky notes. Taste is lightly spicy, plums, grapes, and dark fruits. Vanilla and brown sugar. Gentle carbonation, solid feel, fairly low carbonation. Creamy and fairly sweet. Very nice with age, just as grapey as I recall it being when young, Still some good flavours and great complexity."
"Poured from the bottle a deep reddish brown with a thick tannish head that retained for sometime and left generous lacing on the glass. Smell is bready malt dark fruit raisins and plums with a slight earthy yeasty funk. Taste is bready sweet malt dark fruits with a spicy finish. Mouthfeel is sharp and tight but has such a phenomenal smoothness. Drinkability is wonderful, this is a great beer!"
"Serving type: bottle"
"D - This is a fine sipping ale to be enjoyed slowly. I can see drinking this bad boy while sitting in a smoky club relaxing."
"It's been well over twenty years now but please, please bring back the Brew House Copper and the open squares."
"drinkability - this is a decent beverage"
"D - 9% alcohol and such a complex bomb - one's enough."
"If this was how good my first aging experience went, I am very excited to try out the others that I have down there now."
"Mouthfeel is nice, there's a slight thick creaminess due to the sediment and fluffy bubbles. I would'nt drink more than one or two at a time."
"D: Easy, however after a bottle you feel dizzy, so be careful ;-)"
"Overall: this beer is a rich, complex, delightful ale that evolves as it warms. It isn't boozy, but it isn't completely beer either. It's a very unique, well balance ale that requires an experienced beer connoisseur to completely appreciate."
"Verdict: Chimay Grande Réserve is a beer that comes with a lot of expectations, and I'm happy to report it lives up to the hype nicely. It's solid fresh, but I think a few years of aging might bump this up a third of a grade."
"D: It has been a few years since I had this beer, in the time before I really started getting into Belgians, and it is much, much better than I remember. The flavor is neither too dry or too sweet, and the mouthfeel is light and pleasant. I was surprised by how good it is, and it is absolutely worth buying."
"CHEERS!"
"750 ml bottle. Pours hazy brown with a thick, long lasting tanned head. Aroma is of dark fruit, yeast and brown sugar. The body is full and smooth. Taste is dark fruit, brown sugar and Belgium yeast. Long lasting, dry finish. I used to like this brew much more. Must be my taste has changed over the years."
"D-Goes down easily and another is certainly a possibility"
"A simple example of the style, good looking, and easily found and affordable makes drinkability very high."
"Blue is my favorite of Chimay's offering and my first ""great"" craft brew. A classic, I'm surprised it took me so long to review."
"D-A great beer young, even better with some time."
"D: Hides the 9% very well. I'd enjoy another, but would rather sit back with the Chimay red or white labels. This is a good beer, but not what I want from a BSDA."
"Nice beverage to be certain. I'm going to look forward to aging the next few I get to see if the alcohol presence mellows enough to alow the fruity notes to take center stage."
"Would go well with peanuts or salty crisps."
"D - Very drinkable for this abv. Sneaks up on you. Fantastic beer."
"Poured from 75cl bottle at 18th Street Lounge and Marvin in DC (two separate occassions). Pours dark brown with a small, fast disappearing head. This is very aromatic stuff, with a ""big chew"" grape strongly asserting itself then some raisin, sugar. The flavour is of grape, raisin, dark cherry, with alcohol, and maybe bubblegum. Mouthfeel is medium with very little in the way of carbonation. Drinks down really nice. My favorite of the Chimay beers. Quality has gone down noticably over the years..."
"D: Honestly not an enjoyable or well flavoured beer. Can certainly drink it but it lacks flavour. This is the second bottle I've had of the 2010 vintage, and the first (a 750mL) ended up being a drainpour. I've previously enjoyed Chimay Blue. I also enjoyed both the Chimay Red and White which came in the same tasting pack. I just don't know what's wrong with the Chimay Blue now, it's supposed to be their flagship beer but I can quite honestly say it's just a bad beer at present. Carbonation dies down too quickly (I'm staring at the glass within 10 minutes of opening the bottle and there is 0 head left, a far cry from the Bernardus Abt where the head lasted for 50 minutes or so), flavour is muted. Maybe there's been some problems in bottling but they've occurred repeatedly and I've no problems marking down this most overrated of beers. 2.5"
"Drinkability: Medium drinkability."
"Drinkability - I would get something else. Very poor overall."
"Overall, amazing beer! Great beer, highly recommend it! A bit pricey but my favorite beer."
"Mouthfeel is medium with a semi-dry finish and high carbonation. As the beer warmed the alcohol made itself more noticeable which dinged the drinkability a bit."
"I really enjoyed the Grande Reserve. This is the first Chimay offering that I've had since developing an appreciation for Belgian beers and it won't be my last."
"Although the flavors are rich, the mouthfeel is smooth. Even more so as the brew warms up. The alcohol in the flavor is pretty well masked. Another superb Belgian."
"D- Overall, liquid heaven! Great beer, highly recommend it! A bit pricey but something that will be in my cellar."
"I gave this one all 5s. Chimay Grande Reserve is fantastic as it is, but being in the gigantic bottle changed the way this one ages somewhat and having put a few years of age on it really made it something even more special."
"D- Overall, Chimay Blue is my favorite of the 3 beers from Chimay without question. Great beer, highly recommended!"
"Very drinkable. It balances the dark, complex qualities I expect from a Belgian Strong Dark Ale with a sweet, crisp, and refreshing quality that makes the beer very versatile."
"The Chimay Grande Reserve really stands out from the other beers in their line up."
"D: Overall I thought this was a great beer. Very nice flavors, Incredible mouthfeel, however it was too sweet to have more than a glass at a time for me. That's probably a good thing though, considering the price."
"D - very filling but a delicious quad nonetheless and available all around. Price is a bit steep but I think it's worth treating yourself to one every once in awhile. They do a good gift set too with a nice chalice!"
"D: A great drinking quad and though the alcohol is present it isn't overwhelming"
"D: Very nice. My favorite among the Chimay's. I haven't had this for a few years, but it's nice to come back to."
"One of the best beer in the world!!"
"Pouring this beer into a chalice I immediately smelled a sweet, fruity smell, almost like bananas. There is a smell hint of vanilla, and the alcohol is present as well. The malt smell is so delicious, the scent is making my mouth water just smelling it. The color of the beer is a little darker than I expected for a Belgium, however it is a strong dark ale, so it should have been expected. The beer is a little cloudy, but again, should be expected as it is bottle conditioned and non-filtered. The head retention is amazing, 3-4 minutes after pour I still have at least three centimeters. Tasting the beer I was a bit surprised. It was a lot crisper, cleaner, than I expected. It is very well balanced, to say the least, starts with a sweet/fruity twang than the malts mellow out to the end. I didn't really taste the alcohol until the finish, but it is present. The beer also has a warming effect on the finish, with a medium body. The carbonation in the mouth was around par, not overly abundant but still very noticeable. The creaminess of the beer, mixed with the carbonation, mixed with the body and warmth of the alcohol was really a nice combination."
"I think the temperature of the beer greatly effects the flavor & feel. I enjoy the first glass differently than the last- but good at all temps."
"Pours a unique murky, dark reddish brown color with a bunch of yeast sediment that floats around aimlessly within my Chimay chalice glass. A thick and creamy looking 1/4 inch head forms which recedes to some tiny clumps that seem to linger around on the top of the beer. Smells of Iraqi figs picked fresh off the tree, along with distinct characteristics of dark sun-maid rasins and a strong presence of alcohol. The taste is of sweet, bold malts with definite caramel notes that are followed by a strong alcohol presence. As this brew warms up in the glass, more fruity, alcohol soaked flavors such as the distinct figs and raisins that were noticeable in the aroma become available to the tastebuds. The mouthfeel fits into the med/heavy range and is paired with a high level of carbonation that somehow blends nicely with the beer's characteristics. Definitely a beer to share with a friend, it is bold, smooth, and highly enjoyable."
"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was the bright, full aroma. While the nose was complex it maintained cleanliness throughout, making it very smooth and pleasant to whiff. The subsequent taste profile did not disappoint, as it hit all the major stops throughout the sip. Finally, the nice warming end, where you feel it all down your chest and into your belly, makes this the perfect swill for a chilly winter afternoon."
"Incredible Trappist."
"I still have to learn patience when bringing these up to serving temp - or store them a bit warmer. The flavors and mouthfeel really didn't start showing their true colors until I was halfway done with my glass."
"Translucent brown color, minimal head - like cola, bubbles up and fades to nothing quickly. Very little lacing. Smells of earth, wine, brown sugar, molasses, prune, plum, cherry, mint, orange... ...yeah, very complex. Tastes of the same: molasses up front, fruit in the background, spice and mint, rich earth flavors. Mouthfeel: very tight carbonation, rich texture, smooth body, chewy and thick on the palate, but washes down nicely in the gullet . A singular beer experience. A high class, high quality beer. Don't hesitate: try it if you ever get the chance."
"Drinkabilty - Its a smooth and tasty dark ale. Has nice bold flavors but the alcohol is strong enough that 1 or 2 and done is ample amount. Might be my favorite chimay, and is a great example of the style."
"The big brother of the Chimay beers, the blue is the highest in alcohol content and doesn't hide it. The deer amber red color and cherry/orange scent don't give it away. Once you take a sip a variety of fruit notes hit the tongue with a malty finish, but what is most noticeable for me is a distinct liquor heat on the mouth. It's a tasty, well blended sensation that goes down smooth and maintains a lingering upbeat attitude on the taste buds."
"Out of the handsome royal blue labeled bottle this beer was a tawny red/brown color with a stubbornly persistent head that left excellent lacing .The aroma was mostly of caramel, yeast, raisin bread, alcohol and sweet malts. Kinda reminded me of this alcohol-laced fruitcake my parents used to get every year (which I loved, btw). The flavors were just as rich and complex as one would hope for in the style. I tasted things as varied as tobacco ,gingerbread cookies, plums and cherries, chocolate, caramel, savory yeast and currants. Impressive. The booze was not very well masked which might be a turn-off to some but I kinda demand it in a Belgian Strong Ale The body was full, the mouthfeel velvety and the carbonation delicate. Some say this is the best of the Chimays and those who say such things generally know what they're talking about in this realm..."
"Overall I would have to say I was slightly disappointed. I am going to chalk it up to the style. I just think that this type of beer is not my favorite. It was obviously well made and full of flavor. If you like this style, this is an obvious choice."
"D - Slightly less booze would be good. Couldn't have too many but still very solid."
"D: The appetizing smell and absence of alcohol flavor makes this beer incredibly drinkable."
"D: Drinkability: my ability to drink this is high. This is a goddam delicious brew and I plan to purchase a 750ml as they have the bottle date on cork and then lay it down for a couple years. Of the other Chimay's, this stands out for me."
"D: Fantastic. It's got a great feel that goes down scarily smoothly."
"Cork date of 05/09. Served from bottle into a Delirium Tremens snifter. Poured a hazy almost murky dark brown with a one finger off-white head. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, dark fruit, and slight alcohol. The flavor was of sweet malt, dark fruit, slight hop, and subtle alcohol. It had a medium feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this brew is quite excellent. I have had this one NUMEROUS times in the past and have just now gotten around to reviewing it. The flavor on this one is very nicely balanced and pleasant. It has a good aroma going on, but it is pretty weak in intensity unfortunately. Glad that this one is readily available in my area as this is a great go-to brew. A must try for anyone who has never had it before without a doubt."
"D- Very nice. Any true beer lover must experience this."
"Maybe all brewers should take a vow of silence, it seems to have worked for the monks."
"D - Excellent and amazing beer. A class unto itself. Higher ABV and cost might limit your volume but you won't complain. This is one beer that I don't like to mix with others...."
"This is a wonderful ale. Easy to drink, not so easy to pay for."
"D: Very drinkable, rich and complex."
"Overall, I'm glad I finally got around to this beer. Its a very nice Belgian Dark Strong Ale and it does enough without trying to do too much. After having Chimay's three main offerings I can say that this is probably my favorite. I would certainly strive to give this one a try as soon as you can! Cheers!"
"thick and enjoyable, very drinkable."
"Drinkability is very high until the price is taken into account."
"GOOD STUFF! Poured into mug. The color was like dark caramel, and had a dense 1-1/2 finger beige head. The smell was very nice, but not overpowering, with a raisin, and spice hint. It had a champagne like carbonation, tiny bubble tickling the tongue. The taste was that of a hearty ale with hints of fruit, and spice. The higher alcohol content was barely evident in the taste. It was delicious. Way too drinkable for a beer that I paid $5.50, for a 12oz bottle."
"Drinkability: I could definitely drink a few glasses of these in a night. Not too sweet or bitter or yeasty."
"What a wonderful way to start a wonderful week,"
"Overall impression: smooth, classic Belgian style dark strong ale. would consider a session beer."
"D: A true standard in the beer world. Super drinkable yet rich and satisfying."
"Drinkability: this is a slow sipping beer. Nice and malty, a nice change from the hop heavy beers dominating today."
"Overall: great beer. Very seasoned and spiced. Quite complex."
"D - Excellent. This is an amazing beer. Very well put together. I loved it from start to finish. Even with the high ABV the drinkability is still good."
"Future outlook: I need to put more of this (and some other choice Belgian strong darks) down for some cellaring ASAP."
"Had this a bunch of times but just getting around to reviewing it. Kind of a chuncky pour, but great garnet color. A little less carb then usual. Amazing rich dry fruit aroma, raisins, plums, bread and grape skins. Tastes like a thick jam, again lots of dry fruits, yeast forward with a thick malt body. Deep flavor without being roasty. Despite all of this Chimay blue is rather dry and finishes a bit clean. Little alcohol is present, but a tad is detectable. What a great beer."
"Can easily see why this beer is one of the first belgians people try. Great for someone just learning the style (like me)."
"I would recommend this to anybody who is search of a great Belgian Strong Dark Ale."
"Drinkability - This is a fantastic beer that offers a lot to the mouth and palette! I am very happy i tried it and will buy again if i can find."
"Decent mouthfeel, and very drinkable for the style. Wouldn't go out of my way to buy it again, but not gonna turn it down if offered."
"dark murky brown with maybe a reddish tint to it. head is only about half a finger and dissipates quickly, but looks superb. looks perfect in the goblet. i cant wait to taste it, but i put it off for a moment so i can take in its aroma. the most immediate smell is a lingering scent of belgium yeast. i search for more, i detect a light fruit scent, but not fruity. very faint in the aroma department, but not at all bad. rolls through my mouth with a smooth creaminess. i can taste the fruits i smelled with a maltiness that is both heavy and light at the same time. perfect balance of alcohol, not at all overpowering. carbonation is pretty high, but the bubbles are so fine that it works fantastically. taste lingers in my mouth in a good way, reminds me of that feeling your mouth gets after a sip of cranberry juice. all this sipping and the first glass is gone, so i guess that puts the drinkability pretty high. ill leave it at that as i refill my glass."
"Drinkability -- This is a great BSDA, though not my favorite Chimay (Tripel). While there are others of the style that I prefer, it does not disappoint."
"D: Very drinkable beer, would share with others and would recommend."
"For what it is it's plenty drinkable. If the aroma were better it would be more inviting, however, and smoother carbonation would add an elegance that I feel it's lacking."
"Still a great beer. Pick up if you can. I wouldn't say that it lived up to the hype, but it didn't disappoint."
"D: Obviously a classic quad and it doesn't disappoint. It's not the best but it's good."
"D: A classic, and the beer that made me realise there was more to life than adjunct lager. This is my least favourite iteration of the Chimay Blue, but I'll jot that down to its age -- I'll try ageing one a few years and see what happens then."
"4.0 D: Definitely a solid offering, but I think there are some US breweries making stuff just as good at lower non-import prices. Still, this is something to enjoy from time to time. Good all around, but could use an infusion of power into the aroma."
"An amazing beer. The nose, while interesting and complex, is slightly off-putting, and that menthol medicinal taste is a bit odd, but those are my only small complaints. Good stuff."
"Overall this is one of the best on the planet. Gets improved ratings as well because of the ease at which this can be found all across the country. Definitely a world class beer."
"D - This beer is really great, nicely balanced and very enjoyable. A nice treat every so often."
"The drinkability was smooth and due to the 9%ABV definitely a sipper. Would certainly indulge again. Oh yeah definitely gets better as it warms."
"D: This is one of my favorite brews. I can drink it for lunch, dinner, after dinner and just because. The only issue I've found is that everyone agrees it is best to age it. Sorry, but I can't have a bottle of this and let it sit. I HAVE to drink it. If you've never had a Trappist Ale this is the best one to start with. Sure, there are others that are as good or better, but for the price, this is a great beer to get."
"D: A luscious beer to say the least! So complex in aroma and flavor but balanced and smooth it is a world class beer worth repeating!"
"Overall I was impressed by this Strong Ale. It didn't blow me away like I was expecting, but it does seem to be growing on me the more Belgian strong ales I try."
"Drinkability: Drinkability is very good for a beer with such a high alcohol content. The finish is is fairly dry and refreshing. A very well crafted rendition of the style!"
"D: This is a very well balanced beer and easy to drink. Some alcohol warmth as to be expected but not overwhelming. All in all a well crafted brew."
"D: This is a very well balanced beer and an easy one to drink. Not too complicated or mysterious, just a well crafted and quaffable ale."
"Try it already."
"For such a strong beer, this is incredibly drinkable. I don't think I would have much of a problem if this were a 75 cl bottle. There is a reason this beer is so highly regarded. If you haven't had this beer before, you owe it to yourself to check it out."
"O: Very good example of the style, and a fantastic accompaniment to steak."
"I have a small shrine on my bar as a tribute to this beer -- please come visit if you're worthy ;-)"
"This beer pours a cloudy, dark brown color with 1/2 inch tan head. It has a fruity aroma with a hint of brown sugar. The flavor is banana with chocolate and malt sweetness. The chocolate intensifies as it warms. It's got a very full mouthfeel. Chimay Blue is a good beer overall but is very filling which limits it's drinkability to just one. Recommended."
"Good beer. But I do not feel that this is among the best Belgian brews I have had. Like so many things in our culture that are popular, its not really offensive in any way but it doesn't do much to set itself apart."
"A pour from a 750ml bottle into a Christmas chalice, cloudy brown ale with a solid 3 fingers of fluffy head and plenty of yeast particles throughout the glass. Lots of Belgian yeast coming through in the nose...a nice spiciness, fresh bread, dark fruits, sweet malts - wonderful aromas in this beer. The taste falls right in line with the scents, subtle dark fruits (plums were my first thought), the bready yeast, a touch of spice (clove / coriander) and some malty sweetness to balance it all out. Lots of carbonation and the alcohol is well hidden. A great example of the style that is always worth revisiting throughout the year, with our without some age on the bottle."
"Overall a very good beer but with no special traits it's like a generic Trappist if possible, the flavors tends to mud against each other. But still a very good one"
"Overall this Trappist Ale is subtly complex and a joy to drink."
"D: Medium-High drinkability. This is a great beer that, if I had it, I could drink daily."
"This is a top notch beer. My favorite Belgian Dark Ale."
"Excellent beer. Light flowery bouquet with hints of malt. Nice deep brown color with a thin pillowy head. Very well balanced on the palate, sweet and thin up front, bitterness in the middle and a nice malty, dry finish, that does not outstay its welcome. A full bodied beer. I love the tripel with the lighter fare, especially sushi, but this is the go to beer with steaks."
"Chimay is a triumph in the art of craft beer, and it's easily overlooked. It's ubiquitous, and with a beer geek's aversion to overly marketed beers, you might forget about it. Don't."
"D- Not for the tame of heart. It definitely has a strong alcohol. Strong and bold. Very complex and hearty. Rich. Its a sipping beer. You can't go downing six of these."
"This is a sippin beer, not a drinking beer. I could have one....but I like to enjoy a few."
"D: This is a classic. Not my favorite example of the style but it is one of the best beers in the world and something that you can get with relative ease. Again not the best out there but how can you say anything bad about Chimay?"
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: Medium body, with a nice smooth mouthfeel with perfect carbonation. Very nice. This beer hides it's alcohol very well. Wish I could drink more."
"D: One of the best quads in the world. I am very glad that this is readily available throughout the country."
"medium-plus bodied with appropriate carbonation. for a big beer i could definitely drink a lot of this so a high drinkability score. easily the best of the chimays, and a great trappist BSDA... that said, there are others i like better (which isn't a knock on grande reserve so much as a testament to said others)."
"Overall, this is, like many other have said, a top notch Belgian. It almost defines the BSDA style and it certainly deserves its reputation, but it just isn't the ""wow"" beer I expected. At it's price point, compared to other regularly available BSDA's, this is not the best value out there, but definitely one that everyone should try."
"Fairly well carbonated, light-end of medium bodied. Drinkability isn't bad, definitely a beer worth consuming whenever the mood strikes (or the lack of other options forces your hand). But I doubt I'd ever want a second bottle in a sitting."
"d: an awsome beer that is east drinking. defenitlay could have a few of these."
"Pours a deep brown with hints of ruby red, with a nice thick long lasting off white head. Aroma is pretty much all citrusy hops and some spices, with a bit of a malty backbone. Flavor starts out reasonably sweet and smooth with hints of orange, dark berries and caramel malts. Finish is spices, but not spicy, I can't quite nail it down, but it's dry and nice. Carbonation is nice, and it's really smooth in the mouth, not so much creamy, but very nice."
"D: A drink that goes quite well with itself; a thanksgiving dinner; or one to spur conversation with friends and relatives. In this particular occasion it served all three purposes well, and as I sipped the last drop of this brown nectar, I was immediately reminisce. (4.0)"
"Used a goblet and the it pour a redish brown brew with a full thick creamy beige crown. Heavy body, nice carbonation, no alchol on the nose. Nice balanced aromas of roasted malts with rippen fruits and folral hints. The malts greet you at teh first taste, roated malts, fruits. Alchol is not strongly present despite the 9 abv%. The aftertaste is sweet and refreshing, nice drinkability. As it warms up the alchol becomes more present."
"Very drinkable but the alcohol content is kicking my butt. I love this beer"
"Certainly good, but many other beers are deserving of being in top-100 in my opinion!"
"Drinkability: A very good beer with an interesting hoppiness to it -- clearly, I'm not an expert on BSDAs or anything, but I've had quite a few and typically this ingredient is typically more subdued and I think that's a pretty cool take on it, especially from one of the older breweries in the world; very nice flavors and a nice smell (wish it was just a bit bigger, but still good) and a nice finish; it doesn't really sit all that heavy, so I would say the only thing that would slow anyone down on this beer is the ABV."
"D: Very drinkable, almost dangerously so for a quad with such a high abv. If it was only more affordable. It is the perfect weekend beer, and is delicious."
"Pours a hazy deep orange to brown-ish color with a light tan head. In the aroma, dry, roasty malt, and small fruit hints. In the taste, roasty malts with nice fruit hints, and bit caramel like. A smooth and medium bodied mouthfeel, with a dry big fruitiness in the aftertaste. A bit thin, but great flavor and aroma, hides the ABV."
"Quite drinkable and one of the three best quads of all time."
"Final Thoughts: While BA may regard this as Chimay's best offering, I find it to be their worst. It seems a bit too plain to be a high class beer like their other offerings, and the undisguised alchohol content isn't doing it any favours. It is certainly a good beer, but I much prefered their white over this one."
"I have been drinking ""better"" beer for almost twenty years, and I can't believe It's taken me this long to try a Chimay. I know this beer is a true legend. A very dark muddy brown color with big frothy head and good carbonation. I poured into a snifter and let it warm up a while. Dark fruit and earthy aromas and flavors. Slightly sweet and murky, bittering finish. Overall, this beer really deserves a lot of respect and praise."
"D- the 9% in a 25 ounce bottle can creep up on you watch yourself"
"Truly world class!"
"Picked this up at the local French chain store in Spain. It was a 2010 dated bottle (no born on date). I poured the 0.33L bottle into a non-sanctioned chalice and was befuddled by the amount of creamy head that I was presented with. It started with about 3 fingers of head and within a minute I was left with about one finger. The smell is malty, almost caramel, but fairly intense. The flavour was very good and had tones of caramel and fruits and could taste the alcohol. The mouthfeel was warm from the alcohol-not too terribly syrupy for the darkness - and it lingered for a second gently nudging my taste buds until they resonded. It is very drinkable but due to the price (approx $3.00 US) and the alcohol content I would not consider it a session beer. Still, I will try it again-just not tonight."
"Easily one of my all time favorite beers! Every sip is a treat and I need to just savor it. Pretty much perfect, so complex in flavor and smell with a mouthfeel like a storm of happyness on my tongue. So complex I can't really describe, try for yourself and you wont be disappointed. Nice dark color and head that likes to hang around and stick to the glass. Try with a washed rind cheese, ex. Limburger, Taleggio(even though they stink bad, get over it). Strong alcohol kicks in but is hidden by the overall taste, it will sneak up on you. I really could drink this beer until I'm dead...good for me it's too expensive to drink in quantity."
"Drinkability is good and hides the alcohol very well."
"D-I dont think there's any ""common"" beer as good as this. It never ceases to make me feel wonderful. The taste stays and is easy to drink. I can never have too much of this!!"
"Notes: What is there to say about this beer. It is the quintessential trappist beer. If you've drank it you know what I mean, if you haven't, then try one."
"D: 9% ABV huh? I couldn't taste it. Excellent beer!"
"D: One of the best, although not as great as I remember. I'll try this again after some age. Definitely a world class beer."
"D - This is a slightly heavy beer, not so in the light of a stout or heavy porter, but it is certainly heavy. I don't know how much of this I could have in one night. This is definitely a special occasion brew, and an excellent one at that!"
"Pours a rich mahogany reddish brown color with a medium 1 finger head and some reddish hues when held up to the light. The head recedes quickly as expected and true ton the style. Aromas of caramelized sugars, Pete moss, some rich bready, raisins and some rum even come through. Sweet smelling with a slight booze kick. The taste has rich caramelized sugars, sweet raisin bagel breadiness. Alcohol esters come through but are contained with rich malts that are comforting and very smooth. Carbonated to the max, this cuts through my steak easily. Really pairs well but I bet this would be heaven with vanilla ice cream and caramel sauce. Drinkability is perfect. Easy to put back, pairs well with rich dishes and really has that wow factor you look for in a Trappist ale."
"Drinkability: A beer that I was a little less impressed by than I'd hoped. Don't get me wrong - it's a well-crafted beer. But it's a little too subtle, a little too subdued, a little too quirky - process wise - to be a true standout, even with its complexity. I appreciate the balance and the dryness, as well as all the great yeasty notes, but there are a few things missing here that could improve this beer, and I would have hoped and assumed Chimay would have done those things by now (maybe my tastes are just funky). Regardless, it's still a solid well-made beer, and one I'd be happy to have again if the right pairing came along."
"Poured a dark murky brown color with a fizzy but frothy tan head. This is making a lot of noise, similar to a poured can of coke. Aroma is full of nice hints; raisins & other dried dark fruits, yeast, sweet caramel malt. A very nice typical belgian strong dark ale nose. Taste is full of spice brown sugar sweetness. I do think the mouthfeel is a bit different for the style; on the thin side of moderate with a thin fizzy feel. A very enjoyable strong dark. Drinkable, but after 1 330ml of these i would call it quits due to the cloying sugars. Also, its not as complex as most other trappist beers."
"This has a very sweet fruity taste with some super complex notes. I am never disappointed with any Chimay, as they always have excellent taste in their well crafted brews. It has a bit of a IPA taste to it with its hop notes."
"D: Not much more I can say about this beer that hasn't already been stated. Amazing, complex beer that drinks very easy. Try if you haven't already"
"Drink responsibly. This beer is highly drinkable and highly enjoyable chilled -> RT. You will grow with this beer and it's safe to base your first impressions of a good Belgian ale on this particular interpretation. Drink up and make sure you fully experience everything these wise Trappist monks have to offer."
"D: I'm a little concerned about my ability to finish this bomber by myself tonight, but with proper pacing, this should be a proper beer for a long night of reading."
"overall: a great quad deep and complex beer that is consistently great! My highest recommendation!"
"This brew lives up to every expectation that I had for it. The Trappists never fail to impress. For all of the complexities that are present in this brew, I am extremlely dismayed by seeing the end of this bottle. A masterful brew brewed by the masters themselves."
"Why does this system say I have to write more words about perfection. Can something so good be done by me? no. Do I even really understand perfection? no Can I explain perfection? no 250 characters yet?"
"D: This beer smells very fresh and has a wonderful mouthfeel. Very easy to drink."
"Drinkability: As just any regular Belgian brew, this one is a huge winner. However it really doesn't stand up to well against the rest of the Trappist brews out there. So if you are looking for your dessert beer and there's no Rochefort/Westmalle/Achel/etc around then pick up a Chimay and enjoy out of a nice big chalice."
"Chimay Blue has a cloudy dark brown colour. The head lasts barely 25 seconds but since it is a fairly bubbly beer there are always some bubbles coming to the surface. The smell is fruity with a hint of yeast. This beer has a fruity flavour too and is quite acidic. Actually, it tastes like extra thick Champagne. Like all Chimay beers, it feels great on the mouth: foamy and thick."
"a great beer and everyone should try it, a little age wouldn't hurt its cause but still very nice and well deserving of its spot in the top BA 100"
"The taste is everything. You can taste a variety of malts and caramels, and there is absolutely no after taste despite the 9.0% ABV. I'll return to this one frequently in the future."
"Thank you Father Theodore, for isolating this exceptional yeast."
"D- I must say this beer is a dream for me starting to drink Belgain beer. This one is my top the overall smoothness and taste and smell just outstanding. I can drink this all the time if the price is right of course. But I must get more."
"Drinkability is good, it's a very good beer overall and a great example of the style. The mouthfeel was pretty much perfect which really helped the drinkability for me. It didn't hurt that it was very good tasting either."
"Bottle 750ml. Aroma of figs, grapes, dessert spice (cinnamon, nutmeg), a slight strawberry acidity. Taste is mostly dessert spice, cherries, strong malts (a bit roasted) good sugar presence. Solid mouthfeel long, slightly creamy, good carbonation lots of caracter. I find it a little too much dessert spice oriented for my tastebuds. I prefer the fruitiness of the Pannepot or Rochefort. A very example of the style"
"This an extremely good Belgian dark and wonderfully drinkable. It's sweet but not overly so and with the right amount of roasted character and spices."
"The overall sensation here is rich complex malt with layers of spice and funk balancing out to a warming and and vastly soothing Belgian ale. The finish is sweet and dry at the same time with a crisp and abrupt end made possible by the beers large amount of natural effervescent carbonation. Beers like this are so magical with food - because it is balanced, yet hugely aromatic and displays a wide range of flavors it can match everything from roast beef to chocolate cherry trifle. I do recommend enjoying your first one own its own."
"D: One of my favorite beers so yes, I can drink a lot of these."
"Mouthfeel is very nice and rich, it's like liquid bread. It's yeasty and full in your mouth with lots of carbonation, there is a very light tinge of alcohol but given this is 9% that's ok. The flavor is excellent, lots of dark fruits and molasses. Candi sugar is here, yeast as well. It's really tasty and worth the price. I've got a BSDA in bottles conditioning now, if it's anything like this i'll be amazed."
"As the bottle continues, the alcohol heat melds well with the fruit. Nothing comes close to a hop profile, I guess its all about yeast and fruit. I think this beer is very much about mood."
"Flavor is outstanding! Great Belgian style presence. Trappistes beers are so clean and crisp! Well balanced and just stinkin' tasty! More sweet dark over-ripe fruits including figs and raisins, medium body and slightly malty, great Belgian yeast notes...booze is mild. High carbonation. Definitely my favorite in the line-up from Chimay, even though I love them all!"
"750mL bottle dated 11/06. Brown pour with a tall fizzy off-white head that fades quickly to a loose ring. Smell is dominated by banana esters with some nuttiness, roast, and a touch of alcohol and flowery perfume. Flavor is a lot of roasty, sweet malt and dark fruit finishing with some banana and a fair amount of alcohol. Medium body with a little too much carbonation and an oily finish."
"D- too hard to drink. not sessionable at all. to strong in every respect."
"Pours a deep reddish brown, with edges the color of young port. Generous head is frothy and smells very spicy. There's a lot of clove and pepper aromas at first, with tons of Belgian yeastiness all wafting along warm ethers. Even without tasting it, this is a very tantalizing presentation. The flavors are initially a spicy blast that blossoms into sweeter notes of dark fruits (especially dates), caramels and alcohol so strong that it carries flavors and warming sensations up through my head. Medium body finish long, with dark fruits lingering for minutes afterward. A fantastic sipping experience that never disappoints."
"Phenomenal, 'nuff said."
"D - extremely drinkable. alcohol is present but not overpowering, light bodied enough and tasty enough to make it dangerous."
"Good brew , but i'm not a big fan"
"I must admit I was a little disappointed in Grande Reserve, though I can't help but feeling that an aged bottle could well be the world class ale I was expecting. I will most certainly age my next one for 2 - 3 years minimum."
"Overall the flavor of this beer and mouthfeel were different from any other beer I have had. Very drinkable."
"Not much head, not much lace. Decent brown color. Smells of raspberry cranberry, some sweetish malt with some sourness. Taste mimics smell. A little too carbonated for my taste, stung my tastebuds into submission before i could truly absorb the beer. One is interesting, not exactly an intriguing reinvitation."
"Has a great flavor, smell and feel and I have yet to experience a funky bottle, although they are probably out there. If i haven't shared a Chimay with you, then you know you are not my friend."
"A nice beer, very drinkable. But interesting? Not really."
"Drinkablility: Good beers are easy to drink."
"D: The alcohol is a bit too present to have too many but I'll be drinking this again."
"D - wonderful to drink when you get the opportunity; the cost of the beer can be prohibitive for casual drinking"
"The taste doesn't swing too far from the smell, very nice and smooth going down, a little too drinkable for hitting up 9%... not that it matters until the next day."
"D: decent but not my favorite of this style, but I never turn it down either. If I can get better Trappist I do, otherwise its a semi great beer, that ages well and taste much better 4 or 5 years out. easy to drink a 750ml solo np."
"Has a nice creamy texture but booze and carbonation are a bother. At the price it's at too there are many other Belgian classics I'd enjoy more for equal or lesser costs."
"-If you haven't had this beer ill buy you one if your ever in Austin, Texas"
"Very good overall."
"the only probably with this beer is that it is by no means a session beer. 3 of these in an hour and im toast hahahaha if my stomach will allow it all in"
"D- Excellent. I wish I had a stock of these. Two-three of these would make an excellent nightcap."
"overall drinkability is pretty good, would drink again, very clean - a staple of the style for a reason"
"O: Good. Not terribly complex. Too expensive to drink much of. For the money, I'd rather buy other things. A good, enjoyable beer but to expensive where I live (over $3 for 11.2 oz)."
"There is a nice carbonation and what I thought to be a medium mouthfeel on the heavier side. This is a Belgian Strong Dark ale, and good as is, but just slightly thicker than I thought it would be. Good for the style and smooth going on the way down."
"This is a classy beverage and one of the best ales to be found. Maybe not my favorite Trappist or Trappist-ish ale, but hard to beat."
"Finally get to match the goblet to its namesake for the first time in almost four years! Damn. The beer pours a translucent dark brown topped by a quickly-dissipating finger of white micro-foam. The nose comprises figs, brown sugar, rye bread, grapes, plums, cinnamon, cane sugar, and some dark wheat. The taste holds notes of everything in the nosde, though the rye bread's strength has increased, pepper is added, and a slight bit of maple syrup appears near the end. The body is a hefty medium, with a high moderate carbonation and an ever-so-slightly chewy feel. Overall, a very good BSDA, especially considering its near-ubiquity. Get some!"
"d- Too good. A pleasure to quaff."
"D: Nearly perfect."
"D: I imagine this is what I will offer to my friends who say, ""I just don't like 'dark' beers."" It has such a unique flavor profile, and the higher ABV is well hidden. A great beer to share with friends (although I kept this one to myself)."
"Overall dont get me wrong, I do love this beer. I just dont really love it, Belgians are a fav category, and strong darks are great, but this doesnt do it for me all the way like I was hoping it would."
"A quality beer I've enjoyed on many an occasion, but first review. Well made, drinkable, hides the ABV well, warming."
"Poured into a pilsner glass, a really nice dark brown with a touch of red to it, not much head. Smell yeasty with a slight scent of fruits and flowers caught in the background. Taste is great. The scents that were in the background really come out as well as the grain/bready taste that really come together make this beer what it is. Mouthfeel; for being a strong, dark beer the feel is very light and refreshing with a little bit of carbonation. Overall is a pleasure to drink. I will be getting a few bottles very soon."
"M/D: Such a strong beer is well served with such a light and carbonated feel. The beer goes down easy, but the carbonation brings the beer a certain amount of substantiality. An absolute pleasure to drink."
"D - Very drinkable. There's a reason this is a gold-standard beer for the style. Classic beer, one that's always in my house."
"Fantastic ale, one of the best in my opinion. Pours beautifully into a goblet, very dark, smells great like some fruit potpourri yeast mix. Taste is impeccable, rich in dark/dried fruits, the alcohol comes in at the end but leaves a nice warm feeling in your mouth. I have had it numerous times and it is always a great drink. But I love belgians, i highly recommend it if you havn't already."
"Not overly carbonated."
"Pours a dark brown with a light brown head. Exceptional looking. Doesn't taste as it appears. Light, sweet raisins, plums and dark fruits in a great combination of flavors. Good sweet caramel malt. The taste is so well done, not too sweet or strong and the 9% ABV is well hidden. Light mouth-feel as well."
"This beer is a classic and a fantastic representation of not only the BSDA style but Belgain beers period. But you probably already knew that."
"M/D: Somewhat drinkable, highly disappointed in this brew."
"D - You can drink much more of this beer than you should. Great balance, not heavy, very enjoyable."
"O - One of my first belgians back in the day, and one I keep coming back to. A great gateway beer that is also a great special-occasion beer."
"Poured this beer into a tulip glass and generated a beautiful, foamy light brown head, a fluffy cloud of wonderful beer heights. The color is a deep mahogany brown that strikes an appetizing chord. The malt aroma is strong and sweet. The fruitiness of the yeast connects with deep plum scents, along with a very small snippet of cherry, and there is just a hint of spice to tickle the nose. There is a sweet, lightly malty ride upfront with spice and lots of fruity flavors. I get cherry and plum, with sugary swirls thrown into the mix. There is a touch of roasted malt, but your palate does need to search it out. The alcohol comes across quite pleasently and there is a semi dry finish to it. There is a lot of carbonation going on here and the body is medium full."
"D: One of my heart beers for years. When you see me, offer it to me. Bunch of bottles archived. I'm a fan. It's good, try it."
"jd"
"Decent appearance in the glass, nice thick head. Very light brown color and very cloudy looking. Smells pretty mild, flowery smelling and I'm not sure if this is right but it smells sort of metallic. Tastes better than it smells though. Tastes of orange with a bit of nuttiness, very balanced and easy to drink, no one flavor stands out more than the other. Medium bodied and smooth, just the right amount of carbonation. This beer goes down oh so smoothly, the alcohol is hidden incredibly well, a wonderful representation of style."
"For pics and some more words about this beer check out http://sacbeerlog.blogspot.com"
"Very nice pour with a caramel head, somewhat off white. A nice deep caramel brown color with noticeable particles of yeast floating along with some other flavorings. There is a nice hint of roses or flowers when catching the aromas. When drinking this ale, the first key note is the balance and medium mouthfeel. Perfectly balanced and not overpowering in any way. The taste is extremely balanced with a low to mild bitterness at the end, yet the primary taste is still this flowery feel. The 9% alc. hides extraordinarily well and will catch up on you. Overall an exceptional very smooth beer to drink."
"D: Although the alcohol is well masked, this beer is a great beer to sip and savor all of the complexities in the aroma and taste."
"T- Like the scent, definitely a nutty malt to it. Floral undertones. Definitely has a sharp, crisp taste. Absolutely sensational."
"D: Far too drinkable. Nothing about this beer is overwhelming, and it's just as easy to sip it slowly as it is to swig."
"I have to say even though this beer had a lot to offer, I did not enjoy it. I'm normally a big fan of the Belgian Strong's but this was not for me."
"What a great Belgium! I, being the dork that I am, poured this beer into a red wine glass. Give me a break, it was the best that I had. I am writing this after drinking the entire bottle, well, it was very very good. Great drinkability and look and feel. I am not one for useless (sorry) adjectives to describe the beer, but man, it was great. Drank it with some burgers and potato salad... mmm mmm good. The head was light cream with nice carbonation. I also really like the yeast in the pour, leave it in the bottle if you like, but it really adds to the depth, I think. Great if you are looking for high alcohol and great taste. It's a winner!"
"Made by some mad monks, our Belgian friends are responsible for this AND Audrey Hepburn. The Trappists have put the essence of the Holy Ghost into a bottle!"
"$11.99 at Varsity Liquors"
"D: I am intrigued by this brew -- I am going to purchased a few corked 750s and see what transpires over the time. In the meantime, this is a tasty treat for malt lovers, and I can only imagine 5 years of cellaring will deepen the maltiness and tone down the alcohol. I still enjoy Rochefort 10 a lot more -- better feel, more complex flavor. Still, Chimay Blue is no slouch."
"M/D: Medium body, with a crazy thick velvety mouthfeel from tons of small zippy carbonation bubbles. Its like the beer turns very thick since the carbonation is so high. It makes the body seem fuller than it really is. Drinkability is pretty good partly because of the great mouthfeel, but also because its so interesting, in a good way, but you have to be in the right mood for this beer, not something I could have everyday."
"Don't remember the Vintage, have later had 1999 and 2001. All good!"
"I drank this for the first time yesterday. I was impressed by the color and taste. I am new to tasting beers from other countries other than Canada. I liked the smell of the beer, fruity smelling, same for the taste when it first hits your mouth. then it went away and I could taste of malt. I wasn't impress that it was in my opinion, to carbonated, almost like soda. other than that it was a nice change from my labatts i drink."
"Will have to pick up all the labels very soon."
"Poured the 11.2oz bottle into the widest glass I had clean...a pint glass. Shame on me but hey, I was thirsty. Being somewhat new to the world of ""tasting beer", I have recognized the Chimay label quite often but never tried it. A creamy, off-white head atops this red-orange, cloudy brew. Fruit, caramel, and brown sugar aromas. The fruit aromas roll onto tounge. Figs. Raisins. Has a full-bodied mouthfeel. Somewhat dry also. The 9% abv is well hidden IMO. A great, flavorful brew. A classic from the other reviews I'm reading. I'd like to try the other Chimay colors before I revisit this one. Maybe even buy one of those expensive varitey packs that carry them all and then I can compare all three."
"I will buy this again and recommend it to people!"
"Overall a very drinkable and complex fruity beer with great balance and wine like similarities."
"A nice standard but I feel the bar has been raised by followers. Does it deserve props? For sure, a trailblazer in introducing the world to the Trappist flavors. But I feel a bit more flavor intensity would make this on top of the pile once again (sacrilegious? No, sacreliscious!)."
"Great beer and definitely something I'd drink again."
"Drinkability: A very good and complex Belgian Strong Dark Ale. The alcohol does hit, but so do the fruity flavors. Will definately pick this up again but one glass per sitting max."
"D: This is a great sipping beer to have buy a fire, although the big alcohol presence might want me to limit to one glass. Really intense flavors make this beer stand out on it own, nicely complemented by the buttery Chimay cheeses."
"Excellent beer. Can't wait to see what anther two or four years adds to this brew."
"Drinkability: Great sipper that has fantastic malt complexity. Very much an archetype for the style."
"Notes: Always a nice one. It had been a while since I had it but it is nice to revisit it. I'm really not overblown by it but there is nothing really that gets in the way of a nice drinking experience."
"D: Such a balanced beer and the mouthfeel is really exceptional and was possibly the favorite part of the beer. The alcohol is fairly well concealed and this is an all around great beer."
"only needed a little bit and had to top the bottle with a champagne topper."
"Poured the yeast right in. i love it in a good belgian. This one had a significant head and more carbination then i expected really, very tight carbination too, and medium and creamy mouthfeel. Taste is a decent compex mix of all things quad, dark fruits, yeast, that flavor i always accosiate with mineral water,light spicy finishing hops, and caramel malts."
"I've only had one other Chimay beer (Red) and enjoyed it. I thought the Blue was even better. It pours fairly dark, little bit reddish color in it. Nice foamy head, lingers and laces the glass. The smell and taste is surprisingly sweet. The aftertaste is slightly bitter, but the 9% alcohol is well hidden. I highly recommend this beer."
"Goddamn belgians and the gushing foam. Got head everywhere the second I opened this one. When I got it to settle down, it poured a dark hazy brown with little floaties about in a chimay glass. The taste is a of very dry dark fruits with a little spicyness to it. Its very smooth and easy to drink for the 9%. A very nice strong ale."
"Overall, this beer is very good but the carbonation takes away from the flavor and the alcohol is well hidden, making it easy to drink but difficult to have multiple times in one sitting."
"D - The one bottle I had went down very easily and smoothly. I guess the drinkability is good for a strong ale, but moderation is strongly advised here, because the alcohol is quite well-masked!"
"I have to admit that the beer was a little too carbonated for my liking; that might be the glass's fault, though... but I've had enough Chimay Blue in my days to think that it's more of a bottling issue than anything else. The mouthfeel is good, and this is definitely a very drinkable beer. World-class."
"Consumed: 04/09/10"
"A touch away from perfection..."
"D - You can, and most likely will, put this one down quick. While the alcohol is certainly there to warm you up you never feel. While I want to savor every sip its too enjoyable to stop myself from swigging it back."
"Overall, very nice. Monks do it right!"
"Rich and very malty but at the same time lively. Smooth mouthfeel with a slightly chewy texture. There is noticable Madeira-like oxidation. Out of the melange of spices present, cinnamon dominates. The spice is beautifully balanced by tree fruits and refreshing carbonation. The very complex blend of deep flavors remind me of vintage port."
"This one is a sipper for sure with the high alcohol and fizzy carbonation. A very flavorful, complex beer. Really great beer."
"Overall: One of the best beers I've ever had. If you see it, buy it. I can't recommend this enough."
"I really like this beer, but would go elsewhere for the best of the Belgian Strong Dark Ales..."
"My last impression of Chimay Blue before I stopped drinking it was ""Annoying, way too fruity, overcarbonated mess."" I guess I have changed a bit since then, because Chimay Blue is world class. I think the carbonation, dryness, and deep dark flavors were probably a bit too much for me when I first started getting into beer. Whether I've changed or misremembered or whatever, I love it now. It's one of those all too few beers that gives you some crazy, novel combination of flavors in every sip, each one interesting, palate-pleasing, and satisfying--with real *character* in all 4 of the objective BA rating categories. It's probably time to put Chimay back into regular rotation for me."
"Pours dark slightly orange brown with a nice ecru head, not much lacing. The smell is spicy and full of currant and dried black sweet cherry aroma. It also has a sort of savory note that I am having a hard time placing. Taste is very similar to aroma with tons of dried dark fruit, some brandy character and herbal hop bitterness. This is definitely more sweet than bitter, but there is definitely a decent amount of dryness. The spice from the yeast is much less noticeable in the flavor. This beer seems to mask its alcohol content better than others of the style, though it is present. Mouthfeel is medium, but is lighter than I expected. Somewhat spikey carbonation kind of takes away from the mouthfeel, but the finish is quite nice. Drinkablilty is good for this style. A classic example of the style, and a solid Trappist style ale."
"d - A very nice Belgian. Considering the somewhat low price and the fact that it is readily available in many grocery and beer stores, this is a great beer. Very nice dark fruit and yeast smell/taste, and has a great feel to it. Will definitely have again sometime."
"Nose slightly bitter fact that evokes a bittersweet chocolate with spices. Setting mouth is relatively soft but not sweet, then we can sense the presence of sugar candy. The body is reminiscent of the sweet liquor as a liquor slight but spicy in a nice way. Over time, it offers in its smells and tastes a texture close to the port (Maderisation) while keeping its keys spice. The post-taste is it, bitter and slightly metallic without being excessive and remains mild on the stomach, which surprisingly for a beer in this category. A beer to mature."
"D: As noted above, the carbonation fills you up. Very drinkable otherwise. Good, but not the best BSD. Alcohol is hidden well."
"If you're looking for a very good Belgian ale with a 10%abv, this is a good choice. Serving type: 25.4 oz bottle (we drank the whole thing.)"
"Drinkability: Excellent beer. The high alcohol content turns me off a little bit in this area. However, I could definitely see myself keeping a stock of this in my fridge."
"I've had this many times, and it never, ever, disappoints. Fresh it is great, but aged a year or so makes this a thing of beauty."
"Fantastic Very drinkable."
"Drinkability: The heavyness makes it a slow drinking beer and the alcohol is more present than the 9% would have you believe, without giving a straight up alcohol taste (I mean there is a bit more burn than I would expect). Surprisingly, this alcohol characteristic goes great with the rest of the beer and I am really loving this beer. It's a sipper and a great one at that."
"All though I've been putting off reviewing any Chimay beers because of their widespread notarity, I've tasted it's well deserved."
"I was really looking forward to this one, saving it for last of the three I had. But it's easily my least favorite! Strange. I think this is actually why I didn't check out Chimay for so long: a friend recommended the Blue a while back and I wasn't too impressed. In my opinion the other two are better brews (maybe I'm strange). A well-made and drinkable beer, but if I'm going to be drinking Chimay, I'll take a Red or White any day over the Blue. A letdown only in that my expectations were so high (similar to how I feel about Duvel)."
"poured from 750ml. corked bottle from trader joes($10.99)appearance dark earthy brown w/lively carbonation,nose is exceptional apple,bourbon like smell (fantastic!!!)taste-- one of a kind, that yeast strain and abbaye well water,distinguishes this fabulous trappist brew, in my opinion; the best of its style!!!"
"This beer is an experience, but it is slightly overrated. If you like this beer, try the St. Bernardus Abt. 12. It has less carbonation and tastes bigger overall, but is less homogeneous and balanced."
"I wish I could drink beers like this more often. Alas, I am a poor college student, so these must be saved for special occasions and for trips home when Pops is buying. Great beer."
"Not the best tasting of this beer I've had, but this is really a world class beer. Complex, bold and soft at the same time, it would stand up well to a variety of food."
"drinkability is out of this world - one if not the best BSD's out there"
"Very good drinkability. very complex, great yeast profile, all around great beer. Cellared this for 8 months."
"The scores that I've given here will sum to less than what I really think of this beer. It really is a 100% all round beast - the whole is far greater than the sum of its parts - especially with some age - and the vintages do differ. I was lucky enough to try the 1985, 1986 & 1987 vintages of this in Antwerp in 2009. Awesome experience"
"D - This is a phenomenal beer, worthy of the hype."
"An interesting beer, and better than I remember. Time to try the other two!"
"D: This is what this style of beer is supposed to taste like. I cannot wait to pick up a few more bottles."
"D -This is a fantastic quad that enhanced even more with Chimay cheese. This had a very nice balance, more so than any of the other quads. It seems like most go heavy on the spice, while this has some spice, but not enough to dominate it. I loved this beer and will seek this out again."
"Notes: I do really like this beer. However, compared to other similar and comparable beers, I don't think it holds up as well. Not really a knock on it, it is just in great company. That said, the availability of this beer is certainly a plus, and if I saw it for a good price, I would be all over it."
"Drinkability is ok. I could drink a couple if i wanted to. But i really don't. I was kind let down by all three of the Chimays. I think they are a bit over rated. I honestly doubt i would ever revisit any of these again. Not that they're bad. There's just a ot better beer out there. Over all i would probably give the entire Chimay gift set a 3.75 out of 5. They're worth trying at least once. Plus the chalice is pretty nice too."
"D- This beer does an exceptional job hiding the 9% abv. Definitely one of the better trappist beers out there IMO."
"The beer settled the two cheeses down, exaggerated the juice of the pears, and accented the saltiness of the salame. Overall, the pairings were excellent!"
"Mouthfeel is okay, but the carbonation is a little too much and in your face, otherwise okay."
"Overall, a solid beer but to me the least of the trappists."
"Drank this one again in 2011 and i must say that i am very impressed by this beer. I had a Westy 12 yesterday which was not as good as this one! The westy was fresh however and this one is three years old. Still, this is a very good trappist!!"
"I am drinking it now while listening to Bach Partitas performed by Glen Gould. A very nice beer/music pairing :-)"
"Overall this is an amazing beer that all beer lovers should have on hand to drink every once in a while. I personally like it with a little age on it but this one is a newer bottle and is still great. This beer is a staple around my house."
"World class doesn't do it justice. If you decide to pair it with food, find something light and delicate, otherwise the food will overpower the gentle nature of the beer."
"D- As far as flavor goes I could drink this all day every day, but the ABV will sneak up if not careful."
"Medium body with a creamy, almost thick or viscous feel. A solid beer overall. While it lacks a bit in complexity, it has a great balance and smoothness that makes it top-notch."
"Drinkablity Tasty but could not get after more than one of these."
"D: A good, solid beer, but completely over-rated. I'd rather have any BSDA from Unibroue. I just don't really see anything special going on here. Complexity is present but its very plain (perhaps because its the original?). Mouthfeel sets a standard though. Very carbonated and watery. Goes down easily but also allows me to enjoy the flavor."
"Poured from a stubby little 33 cL bottle, the Grande Réserve pours a cloudy, reddish, cola brown with a thin tan head. The aroma is subtle, with a sweet, yeasty character and an undertone of alcohol. The flavor is both fruity and earthy, with notes of raisins, dried cherries, and other dark dried fruits, and a biting combination of yeast and spice. Highly effervescent like its little brother (Première) and a bit thin in the mouth, but still creamy and smooth nonetheless. At 9% alcohol and with a hint of alcohol in the nose, I was afraid of the booze taking over, but this one is warming without being harsh. Even as it warms, the flavors are amplified but not the alcohol burn. Smooth drinking to the last sediment-filled drop."
"Drinkability - A very balanced example of the style, very drinkable and consistent"
"Carbonation is fine, creates a clean beer that is easy to drink. Not my favorite Belgian, or Abbey Ale for that matter..., but a very fine quality one. Enough complexity to warrant aging if you're a fan. Would go well with roasted meats, or a heavy steak and potatoes meal. Or, it's fine to drink on it's own."
"Overall, this is a classic brew and I highly recommend it."
"M/D- What else can I say? This is one of the best beers I've ever had. If I was rich, this would constantly be on my shelf."
"Pours a brownish amber with not of ton of foam. Nose is bright citrus (orange), bubblegum and some malty sweetness. Taste is quite complex. The orange and bubblegum esters are right where they ought to be and balance the chewiness very well. The finish is quite dry and surprisingly bitter. This beer has a wonderfully balanced complexity about which I could ponder for quite some time."
"D: An indulgent sipping brew that almost anyone can enjoy. Wine drinkers would appreciate this as much as their vino, while any open minded beer drinker would certainly find something to appreciate with this brew."
"The mouthfeel was superb. Drinkability is super good for such a hearty, manly beer."
"Its better in the 750ml bottle for sure. This is one beer that should be aged for at least a year before serving."
"Drinkability is good. Overall this is a really phenomenal beer, maybe the best widely available Belgian out there."
"This beer is just about perfect, so why the 3? At 9% there is no way that you could drink this all night, very nice indeed, but not one to finish the case off in the same night. Highly recommended, one of the best Trappist ales I have ever tried."
"Taste starts out sweet and kind of dry then gets into the clovey taste ends on a darker yeast note. With the carbonation doing its thing. Very very smooth after words just the slightest warming sensation in the throat. Wow I just had to had this and was a shame I have not had this before. I am going to be trying the white and red after this."
"An incredible beer that has become one of my all time favorites. After drinking this (and the other Chimay's) all my other beer reviews seem like straw! This is an incredible beer that blows away everything else I have ever tried."
"D: My favorite Chimay out of the three kinds I've tried. Looks good. Smells good. Most importantly, it tastes great. Strong stuff, but it ages well, so I'll save some more for special occasions."
"D: Absolutely my favorite Belgian, which is why I always keep a few in my cellar."
"D - Too easy for the high ABV. It can get you into serious trouble... fun trouble."
"75 cl bottle. 2009 vintage. Aroma of bubblegum, raisins, yeast, and alcohol. Dark caramel color and quite murky. Flavor is slightly sweet with a substantial alcohol bite. Fairly light and champagne-like on the palate. Finishes dry and somewhat bitter. Improves in the glass as it warms and oxidizes. This is a complex one but not as much so as I remembered and expected. I'd like to try it aged a bit longer as the alcohol was too prominent in this bottle. A little disappointing but still quite good."
"d- this is my first chimay blue, i wanted to drink this one fresh to compare later with a corked bottle i have in the cellar - if anyone reads this and has an opinion on how long to age this, please feel free to bm me. this wasn't what i expected it to be, but i've found that most belgians aren't, i'm enjoying it very much none the less. i definately prefer drinking it cooler before it warms. this isn't an everyday drinking beer, once in awhile is fine for me."
"O: Excellent drinkability. Excellent Trappist specimen. Absolutely recommended"
"Drinkability: Another great beer from Chimay. The Chimay line-up is one of the best in the world of beer. Certainly worth a try and something I will look for in the future."
"Beer is medium to full bodied. Sweet fruit flavors and some alcohol light up the front of the palate, beer is smooth leaving no aftertaste or anything. Second taste I pick up more yeasty character and a good breadiness. Mouthfeel is amazing, the carbonation is providing good connectivity and drinkability is really high. I absolutely slay this beer before I know it. I'm glad this is one of the more accessible Trappists, its a wonderful beer."
"Now that I know where they sell this, I will definitely get this again, quite possibly in the near future."
"gratifying when it does. A 750ml bottle might be the perfect serving amount."
"This is an excellent sipping beer. Let it warm by your side with a book or as lubricant for conversation."
"This beer drinks very well. I was looking at the bottom of the goblet a lot quicker than expected. Even though this is a strong beer, it's not very rich and it's not a slow sipper. It still has a high impact on the palate because of the strong flavors and sweetness, but it doesn't leave me full at all. I thought this beer was more like a quad and would be too much to pair with ordinary foods, but I think it might do well with a steak or some other meal of similar impact. I'm looking forward to trying the other Chimay ales, and using the cool goblet again."
"Pores from 12oz bottle. A nut brown body with a huge off white head with amazing retention. Smells of sweet malts, nuts, spice. Taste is on with. the smell - sweet malts with nuts spice and alcohol. Mouthfeel is perfect, my ideal Belgian. Medium body with good crbonation. Pretty drinkable for the alcohol."
"Poured from the bottle into a small goblet. Pours a dark brown with a slightly red tint and some cloudiness. Golden tan head that dissipates quick and leaves little to no lacing. Spiciness is the first aroma noticed followed immediatley by the alcohol and the sweetness of the malts. Great flavors with the sweet malts and spicy tastes combined with the alcohol warming and tickling. Feel in the mouth is great with an abundance of carbonation and a clean slightly dry, though medium to full-bodied feel. A very drinkable beer but the ABV limits"
"D - amazing - really complex and enjoyable aromas and tastes. could easily have one more, will definately drink again. quite possibly the best beer I have ever tasted"
"D: A solid Strong Dark Ale overall, but I like Maudite just a little more I think. I wish the alcohol presence was just a little more subtle."
"Part of a gift pack poured into the Chimay chalice provided. Nice bubblly head that quickly disapates into a ring with no real lacing. Heavey aroma of fruit and spice plus a scent of alcohol. Taste is the same with dark fruit flavors mixed with a heavy addition of spices and you can taste the high alcohol in this brew. This is not a beer you can drink a lot of in one sitting, needs to be sipped to enjoy."
"The Grande Reserve is simply incredible. I'm still working on the beer as this is being written, and I am not looking forward to the last sip."
"Taste this beer. Just make sure you don't need to be sober after. For some reason after having one of these I feel tipsier than when I drink some higher ABV's ."
"This strong ale is almost too drinkable. My glass was gone before I knew it and I couldn't help but yearn for another taste of this delicious and exemplary Belgian. Definitely an all-time favorite!"
"D - fairly noticeable 9% but still drinkable thanks to classic, well integrated flavors"
"I was impressed by the flavor because alcohol content is rather high. Pours to a golden reddish brown color with a medium sized foamy head, that laced the glass. It has a sweet alcoholic aroma with hints of apple, cranberry, maybe a little a little raspberry. There is a definite apple character in the taste which makes this amazing. The sweetness covers up the alcohol flavor well. Mouth is heavy, coating to the inside of the mouth, and the aftertaste is quite pleasant. It is smooth, and not too carbonated."
"D - Very drinkable and delicious. Somewhat thick and filling though so I couldn't see drinking a lot of this in an evening."
"Christmas is here and I thought I would crack a Chimay Blue label. This beer pours very dark opaque brownish red. The head is generous at first and forms a thin solid line of foam after. The smell of belgium yeast and malt is a preview for the taste spicy clove and sweet maltiness. The mouth feel is good, smooth but by no means thin. the qualm I can find with this beer is that I found the alcohol burn to be a little pronounced, but after a glass or so I stopped noticing it."
"Poured from a ~12 ounce short bottle into a Chimay glass. Pours a dark brown with a 2 finger light caramel head. Strong aroma, though I can't put my finger on it. Taste is sweet, but the alcohol comes through as well. While heavy, it goes down very smooth and feels very light in the mouth. Definitely more of a sipper, but absolutely delicious."
"Had this baby sitting in my fridge for a while (03/07), my buddy said he liked Belgians so I finally decided tonight's the night. Poured from Bomber to Chimay (and Duvel) glass a thick deep brown with an inch of cream colored head that slowly reduced to sketchy lacing. Smell is heavy spices cloves and cinnamon. Taste is better than I remembered. Fruit, spice and Belgiam yeast meld into a fantastic blend of flavors, with a hint of booziness. I will be replacing this one next time I hit the store. This is a treat that should be in everyones stash."
"Nice"
"I think I'd like to drink this with some sushi, it reminds me of a JB roll. Belgian sushi...why not?"
"D-very sweet and tasty with a solid mouthfeel hiding the alcohol very well. well done."
"Scott"
"D: Tastes great, it's a load of complexity that it great to drink. All through out the aroma's never died down. This is something I find rare."
"Would I buy more of it? - not even applicable."
"Impression: An old friend, this beer is a must try for all those looking for the best beer flavors on the planet."
"Pours a nice copper-brown color with some great initial head and decent head throughout; no lacing. Huge deep malty scent; sweet with dark undertones; hints of fig and a semi-candy sweetness. Thick dark taste, very malty with burnt sugar flavors; slight bitterness on the back of the tongue at the end with a little bit of licorice. Goes down smooth, if thick; there is a hint of alcohol in the taste and in the throat as it goes down. Nice Trappist ale!"
"I prefer the blue over the red."
"A true gem of a beer...It hasn't surpassed my favorite Aventinus or Maudite but comes close!"
"D-I like the dryness of this beer. The alcohol is high but doesnt leave you bogged down. However it has a strange twang to it that I just cant get used to."
"price-$18 a bottle"
"There's too many good qualities to really describe in a short summary. The first pour offers an inviting presence, especially through its dark, cloudy nature. The taste is very complex, with the tannic mouthfeel. Drinking a beer of this caliber is similar to a fine wine given its feel and fruit hints."
"Overall, I was glad to try it, but it wasn't so drinkable since the texture was different and the flavor I like seemed to have faded, so I wouldn't get it again."
"D- Moderately high. I took my time with it... but really enjoyed it and will buy some 750mls to tuck away for a rainy day. A great beer."
"Finishing off the bottle gives me a nice warmth, a minor buzz, and wishing I had a second bottle. Very nice overall. A friend of mine once said this was her favorite beer, and I am now beginning to see why."
"I had the small bottle with 'Peres Trappistes' on the label; citrus, raisin, spicey aroma, some sulfur presence, deep dark copper color cloudy with frothy white head, some sediment visible, light sweetness, some fruits, mild alchohol presence,medium body, lively, long finish,"
"D:"
"My wife liked this beer more than me which was I really didn't expect. Our combined rating is the 4 for drinkability."
"Notes: I don't know if this bottle was off, or the water it is brewed with has some sulfur in it or the yeast produced this smell. Minus the sulfur smell intruding the flavor was excellent. My friend said she thought it was excellent and couldn't smell the sulfur. But I grew up on well water all the time so I pick up on sulfur really fast. I will buy another bottle and hope the sulfur isn't a permanent feature, because I can see this being a great beer."
"Drinkability- Highly drinkable, great finish, the complexity is great and is definitely one I will ocassionally be visiting, overall nice balance and a nice winter warming beer,"
"D: I view Chimay as the Armani or Rolex of beer. It's not the best of its kind, but it is shorthand for top of the line to the general public. With that said, this isn't a bad beer at all. Worth a try for anyone who wants to know what Belgian beer is all about."
"D- Overall, this is a nice ""change of pace"" beer. Not one I would want regularly, but one I would gladly drink from time to time."
"overall really just a tasty beer, something to treat yourself to every now and then, but personally i wouldn't have to many."
"D: Possibly entirely too drinkable considering the 9% ABV."
"I planned a Belgian Strong Dark Ale night thinking I would go from weakest to best, those being Unibroue's Trois Pistole, Gouden Carolus Classic, finishing with this. But it might have actually gone the opposite way in terms of my preference. But it's slight degrees of difference as these are all fantastic, world class beers."
"Like all Chimay Beers this is a must try !!!"
"Overall this is my favourite beer to date. I would score it 5's across the board but im adamant that there is a beer out there I will prefer!"
"(D)- I always look forward to drinking this fantastic beer. Also, because of that, I never manage to hang onto a bottle for very long. I look forward to the day of having an aged bottle of this. But anyway, Chimay Blue is a fantastic beer that is even better when enjoyed with a friend, I was feeling pretty good after drinking the whole bottle!"
"Overall, a standard of the style. A must try."
"Overall, a very enjoyable beer and a great representation of the syle, just wish I had the big bottle instead."
"A pretty good example of the style; enjoyable, but I wouldn't call it outstanding."
"Fruity, but in a fig sort of fruity way, with a round, peppery, malty, incredibly complex and balanced body that also possesses a certain nuttiness to it. Very smooth. Very round. The sugars and the 9% ABV hit hard even after only a few months out of the brewery."
"This is beer."
"Soft carbonation up front that subdues a bit when the beer warms. Lots of sweet dark fruit character with hints of fige, prune, raisin and plum as well as some silky chocolate and caramel. Very faint sour presence with some pleasant spiciness. There's some cinnamon, brown sugar and candy sugar that provides an excellent balance and complexity to this amazing beer. The alcohol presence is there but the high ABV is very well masked making it dangerously drinkable. One of my all time favorites."
"Into a chalice, poured a deep dark brown, with two fingers of mocha-colored head and very good lacing. The aroma was a beautiful mix of tart cherry, plum, raisin, oak, clove, coriander, biscuit, and yeast. The flavor revealed all of the above in copious amounts, however the alcohol wasn't very well masked, and the after-burn was a little too much. Nicely smooth and surprisingly carbonated for a thick beer. Good to sip, but difficult to finish an entire 750ml in one sitting, especially because of the alcohol burn."
"D - Without a doubt a great Belgian, must have. This is a must have beer!!!"
"Drinkability: I would drink this every day if I could. Hell, I would take a vow of silence and become a trappist monk if I could drink this every day. It's just that good. However the only thing that I hold against this beer is that it is 9% abv, and unless you have a friend with you, the bottle practically begs to be drank all at once, leaving you potentially giddy from something else besides the deliciousness of the Chimay."
"Drinkability- A beer to savor, a little bit goes a long way. This beer has incredible staying power and the flavor continues to develop long after each sip. That being said, I could drink it all day every day. Leaves a warm feeling inside of you!"
"Overall, This beer is a great classic. It's an easy drinker that is also complex and sophisticated. The abv is hidden well, or else covered up by rich flavor. The flavors become more pronounced as it warms, but this beer is best right out of the fridge in my opinion."
"Overall, this is a tasy, complex brew, as you would expect from a beer bearing the Chimay name. Signature of the style, it only gets more complex and interesting as it warms up."
"I'm not sure I understand the difference between a belgian dark strong ale and a quadruple, but anyway this is pretty good for either category. There are a few american brands actually that I prefer but this is a very solid version of this style. Good dark fruit, great dark color with some cloudiness, good aroma and good carbonation."
"This was poured into a trappist glass brown with a light brown head. It had a dark cherry and chocolate nose to it. The start was slightly bitter with a strong roasted malt finish. Quite a full complex body. This is definitely a beer I let sit out for a bit beforehand though. All in all, this is great stuff - an old faithful when I'm out of town and cannot find a decent liquor store."
"D- This one goes down very smooth and and could have a couple in a sitting if not for the higher abv. I would recommend this one to anyone, another great one from Chimay."
"D- Really nice full flavor. Highly drinkable."
"4.5/4.5/4/4.5"
"Drinkability: Lots of interesting stuff going on here, I would like to try this in a caouple years."
"Pours a dark reddish-brown with a medium tan head. Smells strongly of ripe fruit and a hint of alcohol. Taste is molasses and spicy yeast up front, a smooth malt middle, and a hint of bitterness in the finish. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy, good carbonation levels. A very good beer, a classic among beer geeks, this is a great beer to have every once in awhile. It is not my favorite BSDA, but very enjoyable nonetheless."
"D: Very drinkable. A great beer to convert wine drinkers. It's big, so it must be drank slowly, but I think a bottle could last a person a night of good drinking, two or more people for a more casual event."
"Drinkability: One of my favourite trappist ales. Really well brewed ale, the mix of flavours is almost perfect, and the feel beautifully heavy and smooth for a trappist. A very well known beer that clearly deserves the reputation it has."
"To me, the sweetness and the hint of bitterness in this beer mix just right to create its own unique flavor, even among other great Abby ales. My palate summons grapes, dates and spiced apple."
"The taste is apple, then dark fruit and a bit sweet. The mouthfeel is smooth and well carbonated. I can drink a 4-pack of this in a night, so the drinkability is good."
"As for the taste - what a wonderful taste. I fell in love at first sip. Wonderful elegant taste with so much going on. Noticeable carbonation, but it works so well in this brew. It's just phenomenal - for such a dark, high ABV beer, this thing goes down exceedingly easily."
"4 M&4 D: the creamy-fizziness buttresses the whole flavour profile just fine... it's full-flavoured yet easy to manage on the palate; but somehow the texture falls a bit thin at the back and the yeastiness is slightly rough as well... I can't explain how, but the balance is slightly off, perhaps because this bottle is still too young? Nevertheless, I do enjoy it, esp. having not tried it for two years since my last trip to Belgium. Maybe I need to buy a couple to ""lay down"" for future tasting to see its full potential?"
"What can I say about this beer that hasn't been said before. Perfection in a bottle. The great thing about it is that it's so easily available, if not cheap. It is wise to buy it from a reputable store as I've had one or two that tasted like they weren't stored properly."
"Overall drinkability is only a 4 for me, because of the high ABV, and the sweetness of the fruity tones. Absolutely a fantastic beer, but not something you can have more than 2 of, realistically."
"D - was expecting a lot and got it. one of the finer beers i've ever had. it's a step above anything massed produced. it looks different, smells different, and definately tastes different."
"the bottle was bought from NJ to Fairfax (Virginia), just had it at 11 in the morning, I'm on a beer trip here in us. Wow, this beer is..Poured from the bottle into a goblet. Pours a brilliant crimson red & cloudy with a massive suede head. Its beautiful to look at against the sunlight. Showed a lot of life, surprisingly for a big beer. Okay, the smell was dark and fruity all the way. A lot of damson and caramel, and reminded me of a walnut pudding. The head retained all the while so I had my first sip of Chimay thru it - massive to say the least. Dark fruits, mainly plums and caramel are in your face. A little tart feel remains prominent in between sips. Mouthfeel is solid and heavy with medium carbonation. I would keep it down to 1 bottle a go for the ABV, which by the way it hides very well. Very easy to go astray with this one I would say."
"Pours a deep dark copper that is very chocolately and has a nice persistent tan head. Smell is chocolate, caramel, roasted malt, sour mash, sweet yeast, bread, crust, sugar, molasses, strawberries, blueberries, and peaches. Taste is nice and grounded in some nice roasted malts, with some slight sour yeasty malty in the aftersmell. Mouthfeel is nice and thick and good. Drinkability is good."
"If I were stuck on a desert island with nothing but this I would praise God for the wonderful monks at chimay! God bless em! And if I could afford it always I would drink it quite often!"
"D - A great beer for the special occasion. A little over powered on the malt. Perfect beer to share or for review by yourself (like I did)."
"A must buy."
"Poured from a stubby 330ml bottle into my Chimay goblet. The ale appears a deep crimson brown color with a good two fingers of fluffy ecru foam. Nose and flavor are of sweet fruits such as dark cherries, figs, raisins, caramelized malt, somewhat spicy yeast, a tad nutty, not much alcohol to speak of. Approaching full bodied with more than adequate carbonation. Very nice!"
"D= pretty good. Not my fave style but this one is really good. Smooth crisp clean and sweet at the same time."
"Overall, an excellent beer. With such a high price tag I would probably reserve it solely for special occasions, but I'd love to have another sometime soon."
"Jordan."
"Poured brown with a generous head that lasted for a little while. The aroma was slightly sour to me, but I admit, it may be the fault of the equipment (nose). The taste is sweet, but carbonation (I know, not a taste), robbed me of my tongue. This one was medium bodied with a lot of carbonation left over from the head. Drinkability was average, but I thought the 750 ml would never end. I did like Chimay Red better."
"Overall I had not had this beer in quite a while and having it again makes me wonder why. The mouthfeel and clean flavors highlight what is a very good beer. Recommend."
"D - The dark rye flavored malt balances the spicy cherry flavors and alcohol, keeping the beer from tasting medicinal (like cough syrup). The mouthfeel is nice and clean."
"Pours a medium brown color with a one finger head. The smell is of fruit and roasted sweet malt, plum and cherry notes present. The taste is of sweet malt with cherries and plum, good hiding of the alcohol content. The mouthfeel was of moderate to high carbonation, however, it wasn't as slick as i expected. The overall drinkability is very good. It hides the alcohol better than some belgium darks, and has a nice fruit taste and smell that is par for the class."
"You do tatse the alcohol after a while"
"mmmm chimay is good beer!!! the taste is off the chain it screams fruit and the finish is excellent with a slight bitter sweetness! this is a bubbly brew and the flavor was dancing all over the place the beers flavors progressed as it warmed up and left me feeling nice"
"D - Very good. Just slightly ligther than a quad but pushing the line there."
"The mouthfeel and drinkability hit the mark. All in all, a superior beer."
"D - I could drink this all night and would if I had more."
"d - nicely done even though a little heat was evident yet pleasurable."
"Drink is a bit boozey really a bit to spicey for a good session beer. A definite taster. Not a session brew at all in my opinion."
"D- Pretty drinkable, the alcohol doesn't pack an overly vicious punch so this is a very drinkable beer."
"Drinkability: at 9%, the alcohol really starts to affect the drinkability of this. It is super tasty, but we're talking about a nice dessert or digestif beer here."
"Dr. Very good, but I doubt I'd do more than one. It's more like desert than a ""drinkin"" beer."
"D- love this beer. I am partial to Belgian Strong Ale and this is a fine example. Have several more bombers in the cellar...hope I can keep my hands off for a couple of years to allow to age"
"Overall, a great beer that simply must be enjoyed, preferably for a celebration of some sort, due to the price. But i would definitely but this again."
"A very good dark belgian, you owe it to yourself to give it a try."
"This has great drinkability for a 9% beer. Alcohol is very well hidden. So enjoyable on the palate and the complexity keeps me going back for more."
"Poured from a small bottle; has a deep red-brown color and a thin head. Smells of bread and malts with a hint of fruit. Taste definitely has some alcohol in it as well as some dark fruit, giving it a nice semi-sweet taste with a slight kick, definitely something to keep in the mouth to savor."
"D: Very drinkable and elegant. This is a nice beer to sit down and watch movies with, or to share with someone over a nice cheese plate."
"750 ml corked and caged bottle purchased from the grocery store for right under ten dollars, split with my dad last night, poured into a Chimay goblet, I have had this a few times before as well, color is a mix between medium brown and a dark amber, one inch creamy off white head, aroma consists of Belgian sugars and yeast, dark fruits, sweet malt, citrus, toffee, hint of booze, and strawberries, flavor begins with sweet malt, mostly caramel and prunes in the middle, finishes with some sweetness from oranges and same malts, bit warming in the finish but very mild, warms up with more fruit character and complexities from the caramel, sweet, creamy, and malty mouthfeel, medium bodied, pretty high carbonation that kind of dampered the whole mouthfeel for me, goes down pretty easy for a nine percent beer, smooth and not overly sweet, would be a nice beer to have lying around in the colder months, this beer is a staple and there is good reason for that, not the best but it is a classic Belgian brew and it deserves it rank, I am sure I will cross paths with this one again, worth trying"
"Simply incredible. Beautiful dark reddish body with a small head. Very strong taste with an ABV of 9% but the alcohol is masked behind glorious flavors and spices. Its also sold at the supermarket around the corner from my house, yeah. I will have this again."
"From a brown 11.2 oz. bottle. Pours a cloudy, dark brown color with a 1 inch head. Smells of alcohol and sugar. Taste of yeast, a bit sour, and alcohol. Feels great in the mouth and has decent drinkability. Overall a good beer, but not great like the other reviews here."
"Poured a very dark amber color with good carbonation and a small white head. Nose is malt, dried fruits and citrus. Taste was nice malt, caramel, figs, prunes and light citrus. Really smooth and very drinkable. Mouthfeel was creamy and drinkability is good but its not my sttyle."
"This beer poured a gorgeous deeply cloudy reddish brown with a one of the most lively bubbly white heads that I've ever seen. Head retention is outstanding eventually receding to creamy foam that leaves nice sticky lacing on the glass. Nose is of dark fruits - cherries, raisins, dates, and distinct but not overpowering alcohol presence. Taste is of the dark fruits - cherries and raisins with some molasses in the body, there is a touch of spice as well in here, alcohol is also easily present. As the beer warms, fruit flavoring becomes more pronounced and I pick a bit of plum and apple in the taste. Medium body with moderate to high carbonation, light and airy feel on the tongue. This is incredibly drinkable beer - 9% it is a sipper but could sit with it for an evening."
"Mouthfeel is fizzy.. fairly light. Drinkability is excellent. Definitely a great beer."
"Wow - this brew is a definite sipper. Something to be enjoyed. This is a brew to savor, and enjoy on special occasions or times of year. Not something to ""get whacked"" with... although it would be easy and fun to do so. Stellar."
"Drinkability- High. Easy drinking and very intriguing. Each sip makes you want another. I wouldn't mind going through quite a few of these in a sitting."
"Could sip this one all night long."
"This rivals the Rocheforte 8 for my favorite overall beer."
"Sometimes I think smooth should be spelled with an e at the end, but i'm pretty sure that's wrong."
"Carbonation is good: high, but not too prickly."
"A cloudy dark brown color pour with a thin tan head , spotty lacing , highly carbonated. Aroma of sweet malt , Belgian yeast , bread, rasins,lightly flopral and a hint of apple. Flavor is slightly bitter, nice sweet caramel taste, dark fruit , bread and a hint of spice. The high ABV is pretty well hidden and with the tiny carbonation bubbles helping to give a dry finish, well balanced , Full body with a smooth mouthfeel. Very drinkable , and quite enjoyable all around."
"For me, the major challenger to this beer, in terms of beers that I can realistically drink often, would be Trois Pistoles from Unibroue, which is stellar in its own right. Chimay Grande Reserve is a ""bona fide"" Belgian, more subtle in all ways than TP but also much more complex and interesting, and probably better ""all-around""."
"This is a very nice Belgian quad, lots of nice aromas and flavors in this beer. I will be drinking this again."
"BSDAs are quickly becoming the yin to my DIPA-lovin' yang, and this one is right up there in terms of quality and enjoyability. More contemplative musings on a hipster patio than down 'em if ya got 'em, but that's all right by me."
"Chimay red on tap was one of my first craft beers, though it's taken me a long time to get around to grande reserve. Would like to catch this one on tap, as well, and it would probably make for an even better experience."
"Poured from the bottle into the Chimay chalice, beer is a deep, murky brown color with an active, quickly fading, cream colored head. The smell is a mix of spicy yeast, slight fruitiness that reminds me of fruit punch and an alcohol sweetness. The taste starts of with the slightly sweet, dark fruity flavor that was present in the nose and transitions to a slightly bitter, dry, warming alcohol finish. Raisins and figs, slightly spicy. Complex yet simple and difficult to discribe. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a thin, whispy carbonation. Overall, a very drinkable beer that one would not expect the high ABV that is present in this beer. Drink with care."
"O- This is the beer that started me down the road to craft beer. It might not be the best Belgian Trappist beer out there, but it is quite good. I will always recommend to start with this beer for someone looking to get into craft beer."
"D: This is dangerously drinkable. At 9.00% ABV it's not even close to a session beer, but flavorwise it damn well could be. A sipper you can gulp."
"Taste is a blend of fairly sweet caramel, dark fruit, molasses, a touch of clove, and a dry cocoa powder finish. Finish is slightly tart. The 9% is pretty well hidden, though slightly noticeable in the finish. A pretty good Belgian."
"The carbonation seems to be just right. It's a bubbly cushion that helps combine and sooth. But it doesn't fall out too easily, which is nice. I don't pay for a beer that is there and gone without even recognizing it."
"Pours dark brown with no apparent head. Aromas are of molasses, caramel malt, fig, alcohol, fruit, yeast, spice. The taste is initally of a molasses, spice and then the figgy and fruity flavors kick in with the alcohol flavor and warmth. The alcohol is noticeable, but the beer is incredibly smooth and delicious. The mouthfeel is a little heavier than it's brothers but it still has that carbonation tingle that adds to the body and smoothness of the beer. One of the best beers I've had. Delicious flavors, definitely won't pass this up if I'm out and it is available."
"D - An outstanding beer. I can't believe it's taken me so long to actually log a review."
"Drinkability: Well due to the high ABV and darkness its not really something you're gonna sit down and have four in a row. You'd be drunk and you're stomach. So it is a sipping beer. But for the ABV and everything else its a pleasure to consume and finish."
"D - Surprisingly high for the ABV, I will be finishing this with dinner."
"Actually, its finish is most reminiscent of the Dogfish Head Midas Touch, which uses honey, saffron, and grapes. So, what the heck is Chimay using? I thought it neutralized the alcohol very well."
"Nose is sweet dark fruit with lots of spice character. Dark fruit flavors dominate, with a sense of spicy apple cider throughout. Medium to heavy in body, with a thick stickiness cut by lots of tiny bubbles. Tingly, highly carbonated finish. Alcohol shows up--quite strongly--in the second half of the glass. I'm not sure why it appeared so suddenly and so strongly, but it kind of took center stage once it did, hurting the drinkability aspect."
"I think this is the Chimay-beer you should prioritize last on your wishing-list. It is a must on your list, but if you have to choose between this or the other Chimays this one is a clear third choice. When I try these three again (I have three of each in my beer-storage) I will change the order and possibly the ratings will change as well (bare in mind I already had two other, rather strong beers with lots of flavours before this one)."
"The alcohol is not a factor, so it's very easy to drink or sip as it warms up and allows more flavors to prevail. Overall a very good beer and quite enjoyable. I've had this on many occasions and enjoyed it every time."
"Mouthfeel: very highly carbonated - giving it a slight carbonic bite. Dry finish."
"Overall, a great representation of the style. As far as Trappist breweries go, I would put this towards the bottom of the list, but that isn't saying much considering the qualities of those beers."
"D- Super easy to drink and highly recommended."
"I love this brew, it is one of my go to brews. Although this is the first time I sat to review it the drikability is of the charts. This is the brew that got me into Belgians and is well worth the effort to try"
"D- Very drinkable, I kept going back for more, I just wish the taste was a bit bolder. The alcohol is hidden extremely well, I did not sense it at all. I really need to try this and other chimays with their cheese as well, it probably makes the experience better. While I liked blue and could of drank a ton more of it, the flavor is quite tame compared to other and more acce$$ible offerings."
"11.2 oz bottle. Pours cloudy, red-brown color. Nice head and pleasant aroma. Taste is strong and very good overall. Very complex, with some alcohol apparent, which is not surprising for an ale of this strength. Very enjoyable and will be a regular for me I think."
"D. Very good SDA. A little less complexity than some of the other premiere beers within the style. Very easy to drink."
"Drinkability is great with the abundance of carbonation, but the high alcohol makes this one particularly devious."
"It's one of the classics, and it shows. Very, very drinkable, especially for the ABV. A beer you can't go wrong with."
"This is one beer that it should be a crime to drink quickly. I find that if drink it slowly and really keep each sip in my mouth for a few moments; it make each bottle worth ten times more that the $10 price tag. A fantastic brew and my all time favorite. This is one of the few beers (all of them trappist) that motivate me to drive 30 minutes to obtain. Each helping only makes me want more."
"I mentioned I found the tastes a little faint. I also found my palette was in very good shape after a bottle, rather than being a little tired, and I could see myself being able to sip this all night without my enjoyment dropping. At least until the alcohol thats hiding in their leaps out and knocks me out. Not a personal favourite, but it's still right up there for me."
"D- I'm loving this, I could drink it for a long time. Gotta get me some more."
"[xYR; aTap]"
"I got to say, I am quite disappointed. I was hoping for a stronger, more flavorful version of the Red. This may have been a bad bottle, but I got it in the same sample pack as the other two Chimay beers, which tasted fine. I personally feel the Red was the richest and most flavorful. Don't get me wrong, this is a good beer, but this one lacks the creamyness and flavor the other two had."
"My favorite of the Chimays, in the early 1990s this was part of my introduction to good beer. While I enjoy it, I do not reach for it much anymore - I go for a bigger Belgian. Not taking anything away from Chimay blue - a classic."
"Perhaps the finest Belgian Trappist Ale in existence. This is a complex and delicate brew with at least 2 different yeasts in the brewing process both top and bottom fermenting. This attention to detail creats a complexity and a character that rivals any malt beverage brewed anywhere at any price. The flavor notes vary from coffee, chocolate, cherry, vanilla, toffee and lemon. This wide of a flavor palate rivals a fine Bordeax wine in complexity but at less than half the price on average provides far better value for the money. The appearance, smell taste and mouthfeel are all off the charts superb. Note, cellaring this beer for more than one year can allow for some moderate level metallic notes. They do not ruin the overall experience but they diminish it to a small degree."
"D - Refreshing but with higher ABV. 1 or 2 should suffice for me."
"CHEERS!"
"D: This is a very drinkable beer until you go to stand up but thats the best part about it. As far as buying it agian i think i just found the best gift to give anybody who likes to drink beer and as for myself i will be buying some more tomarrow for sure."
"Drinkability/Final thoughts - I don't know where to start, first off the alcohol is dangerously hidden, you really got to be careful with this one, and the flavors are something Ive never experienced before! I was expecting a robust bitter beer, but this thing tastes like hard cider, like something I would enjoy over the Christmas season! The experience was amazing, I could put down an entire bottle of this and not even be aware of the dangerous alcoholic contents! Coming in at 13.99$ a bottle in CA, it's very expensive but if you can get your hands on it, it will blow you away. I absolutely loved this brew. Cheers!"
"Notes: A great beer. I suppose that I prefer St. Bernardus ABT 12, but this one is slightly more refreshing, though less dessert-like."
"Drinkability: Such a great beer, at the end of the glass all I can do is think about the next bottle. A great beer to relax and session."
"This is a really classic beer. Just solid all-around. Can't believe it's been so long since I last had it. That won't be happening again."
"Drink I'm glad I shared this with someone and didn't have to drink the bottle myself."
"This is a very drinkable strong dark ale. Wonderful flavors, but watch out for the abv."
"One of my favorite styles, and certainly one of my favorites amongst it. This is an excellent Belgian Dark, full of flavor and character, and 100% authentic."
"Drinkability: A nice beer and I won't turn it down in the future but I think there are many other Trappist beers higher on my list that I would drink in preference."
"I tried this ale awhile back when I first got out of BMC and I didn't think much of it. I think it's good but I prefer other ale's that are similiar."
"Had this for the first time today, on my birthday, June 4th! After all the hype and dropping $14 in PA, I was NOT disappointed."
"Hands down the most satisfying beer I have had yet. Incredible aroma (fruits such as grapes and apples). I felt that the carbonation added another layer to the beverage by giving it an effervescent mouthfeel. Be sure to let it rest once you take the bottle out of the fridge so that the multiple flavors are not masked by the cold temperatures. Over the course of drinking this Chimay, I noticed the flavors became more pronounced and complex, making for a very exciting drinking experience. The taste consisted of dark fruits and spice from the yeast. Some malty sweetness and a hint of alcohol. An incredible beer and experience."
"This is a flaming hot crossbow bolt of a brew, explosive in potency yet calming and luxurious. It's a beer that makes you feel like a king. Superbly crafted, flavourful and playful. Simply wonderful right across the board."
"Still one of the best beers on the market"
"World class."
"D - Grand Reserve is a beer I've had on many occasions, even before I was into good beer as a whole. I'm surprised it's taken me this long to get around to reviewing it, but figured there was no better time due to my recent fascination with Belgians. Certainly a good a beer, though I'm not sure I applaud it as much as the beer community at large. Tasty, but somehow indistinct and unoriginal in the world of fine Belgian beers. In a way, it's a little *too* subtle for a big Belgian beer."
"The trapist brew pours a coca cola color brown with a hint of ruby red in it. the head too a little extra umph to form a nice size. The aroma from this brew is great and is filled with dark fruits, malasas smell with alcohol along the way. The flavor is a great taste of dark fruits with figs and so on balanced with a great sweet malt. The flavor was not extremly complex as to overwhelm the drinker but was perfect to entice the drinker for more. The alcohol level in this brew is tasted but is also balanced well with the dark fruit flavor. This beer I love to drink the whole night as it is a work of crafting art."
"Poured into a Duvel glass. A dark ruby and brown beer with a big cream colored head. Lots of lace. Low levels of the typicla rumminess, and some yeasty esters. The flavor is much more appealing. Chocolate, rum raisin, caramelized sugars. Very nice. The high alcohol of Chimay Blue do not cause this beer to come off as thing. Matter of fact, it has a quite silky mouthfeel. I shoul get a couple for the cellar. Gotta love the monks."
"D: With the ABV of 9.00% set aside, I would love to have another one. This beats out the Chimay Red & White, but not to take away from those two either since they are really good as well. This is my first ""all 5"" beer."
"OVERALL: A real treat of the brewing industry. One of the best beers out there, and fits in well with the other great offerings from Chimay. This one is actually very dubbel like; could be described as a dubbel on steroids. Very drinkable and extremely enjoyable, this one is a must try for all Belgian beer fans. I'll have to make a nice place in the beer cellar for a stock load of these. Sublime."
"Drinkability- Very drinkable, and very good. The Chimay beers are outstanding. If you haven't tried them yet, you must."
"A good BSDA, and one that lives up to the hype in my honest opinion. Strong flavors, complex and quite delicious. Recommended"
"Smell of dark fruit tort cake, candied fruit, prunes and with air and warming, a minty air about it. Taste is layered caramel, bitter sour fruit flashes, well balanced acidity. Smooth and even mouthfeel with a bitter finish and sour dark fruit aftertaste. Alcohol well integrated. With air and warming came better balance and a more even flavour profile, rich texture yet smooth and tasty. This could be my favourite of the Chimays I've tried, I could easily go for another right this minute if only I had one available."
"Grand Reserve is no doubt a classic. It's an excellent BSDA. To be honest, I've had better representations of the style, but this one easily competes with the best of them. The only thing that really holds it back a little is its body. It just feels too thin and carbonation's a tad high. But, it's all around very impressive otherwise. It probably deserves its spot in the bottom quarter of the Top 100 somewhere. How long it will stay there is anyone's best guess. Impressive stuff."
"drinkability- not a multiple beer at all. One beer and that is it. I think the red or blanche is more of a multiple beer. Still, the blue is the best by far. I still think the Orval is a better overall beer but the Chimay is world class. In a 330 can do 2 or 3 but in a 750 only one is enough. Not as heavy as other Belgian dark ales so much more drinkable."
"D: really good flavor, classic belgian quad style, the slight alcohol tinge only slightly hurts the drinkability factor"
"D. This is a beer to settle into so to speak. Divinely crafted and really quite fantastic. It recieves a high score because this beer is fun to drink."
"D: Delicious.. very nice beer, much stronger in flavor and body than it's red labeled brother. More of a sipper, but still a great beer."
"Solid atmosphere. Appearance is decent, nose is great. Complex, balanced flavor. Alot in there, but really smooth, velvety feel. This is a great quaff."
"D: Decent. A few other brews in this style are a bit more pleasing on the stomach and make for a more enjoyable experience, but this is a classic which needs to be experimented with."
"D- Simply an awesome beer."
"Probably the best Chimay. Good appearance, goes down smooth, with wonderful taste. I will take the advice of others around here and age some, see how it works out. Sharp bust good taste to the mouth, with steller mouthfeel. A must have if you're a trappist beer drinker."
"From a 33cl botle in Lund. A beautiful dark opaque chestnut color with a big and wild off-white head that leaves a delecate layer of foam after a few minutes. The Aroma is of brown sugar and spiced apple, with a hint of bitter orange peel topping it off. The flavor is sweet with lots of maltiness and some citrus, but the finish imparts some bitterness with the high ABV showing up to close it off. The mouthfeel is syrupy and thick, with good carbonation. This is a good beer, maybe great, but I might like Chimay Red better because of its great balance of flavors. Blue is definitely a complex and intense beer. I'm looking forward to trying another (8 4 8 4 16) - - - rerate: 750ml bottle, served in a Chimay glass. This time around, I didn't pick up nearly as much of the flavor that I remember from before. There was less sweetness and more yeastiness, and thats about it. I really wasn't impressed. It's possible that this was a consequence from coming across the pond this time, but a brew like this should stand up to that. Disappointing. Next up. I need to cellar some to see if it improves for me, like so many people claim that it does."
"Definitely need to try if you're a beer review on this site."
"Held up to the light there is a lot of sediment in suspension. Fine with me. A very good, well balanced beer."
"The rich aroma matches well with the robust yet very drinkable taste. All in all, this is a very balanced and enjoyable beer. There are, surprisingly enough, notes of balsamic vinegar - this is the first time I've tasted that in a a beer. This is one you should definitely try - if you can spare the change, as it's quite pricey."
"Poured into a Chimay glass. Pours a nice brown-raisin color with a rapidly dissipating head. Aroma of mostly cherries, alcohol and caramel. Lots of caramel and candy apples in the taste. Also got hints of fruit cake and rum? Carbonation reminds me of champagne. Wow what a great brew. It gets better as it warms I have had this beer many times and have found different flavors each time. I always have a bottle of this and the Chimay white in my fridge. Excellent."
"The smell is great, strong of molasses and dark fruits and alcohol. The taste is amazing, sweet and malty with a cherry and dark with the fruits continuing. Seemed a bit over carbonated when it was cold, but that went away as it warmed. Overall a great beer."
"D- i would say easy drinking."
"Definitely doesn't disappoint!"
"D - The alcohol hides well behind a delicate flavor that is an easy drink for this style but in the end it's not overly fantastic to me."
"D: Don't know; it's delicious and all, but a bottle of this is not going to last very long, especially taking the price into account ($11). This is definitely a beer worth savoring, though."
"Like I said - it's the reference point for the style, and while it's been surpassed it's still a terrific and worthwhile brew, particularly in places like Ontario where there are limited options."
"Mouthfeel: Smooth, creamy carbonation with a medium to full body."
"Drinbkability is excellent for the size - full flavored and delicious, with a hefty alcohol presence that always seems well-integrated, balancing, and flavorful rather than out of place."
"2009 vintage. Belgium to Singapore via Australia, so probably a bit travel weary. Exceptional, still. Not much of a head, subtle spices in the nose, delightful pungency and same subtle spice taste, light subdued carbonation in the mouth, aftertaste of spices, caramel and an undefinable pleasant bitterness lasts practically for ever. Exceptional beer!"
"Such an excellent brew."
"D: A very nice sipper, especially out of the Chimay goblet."
"Very good, but I think red is better."
"One of my favourites. Reminds me of Avintinus, another one of my favourites...but even smoother."
"Overall, I've wanted to try this beer for a long time, and I was better off before."
"Notes: This is definitely the best of the Chimay offerings, and it's a damn fine beer. Further tastings of other Belgian Strong Dark Ales must follow this one in order for me to make a claim on if it is overrated like most other BA's seem to think, but right now, on a cool spring night, I can't see how this beer could be called anything but excellent."
"(05-13-09)NOTE(All red, white, and blue are great.)"
"I poured from a 11.2 ounce bottle into a snifter. It pours a caramel brown with a big white head. The fruity esters in the aroma are wonderful, a mix of dark fruit and alcohol. The flavor is sweet with dark fruit notes and finishes with a pleasing amount of alcohol. The brew is medium bodied and has a nice creamy mouthfeel. I am dissapointed I did not buy the big bottle, really good stuff."
"just a good,solid beer, exemplary drink, near perfect execution. it is so balanced and subdued, it feels like the first love that you wouldn't think is the best overall. but still you evoke memories, filling you with that good feeling."
"Mouthfeel is fuller bodied with good carbonation. Drinkability is good but one is enough whereas the red I could drink all night."
"D- Could easily drink a bottle of this and maybe another depending on the mood. Two would put a glow on my face"
"One of my favorite Trappists. I have to buy it in the cask and I can't help but finish the whole thing in one sitting. For a dark ale it drinks very smooth and has a complex mix of flavors. Just writing this review makes me want to go get another cask for tonight."
"Drinkability: Good. One or two at a sitting, but probably no more than that."
"This beer is the stuff of legends. I have heard many this about Belgian beers and this comes through much better than expected. It is clear that this beer copied and cloned but never surpassed."
"The bitterness is primarily chocolate rather than hops. Malty, yeasty, and just a little sweet (but not too sweet even for this semi-hop-head). Light citrus, earth and Caramel. Champagne -like carbonation and thin but always present head. Really good. If it were cheaper I'd drink it all the time."
"Chimay's reputation may have superseded it for me. It is widely hailed as one of the world's finest beers, only now can I agree rightfully so. It's only apt that this is brewed by monks because it has clearly achieved a higher state of being. This is a heavenly drink, no doubt, that should be found in any respectable beer cellar."
"D. I was satisfied by the overall experience and may give this style another chance based on this tasting."
"Chimay Blue has a rich carmel color and you cannot see through the glass. Very frothy head, lots of lace, and the tinyest bubbles i have ever encountered. The bottle is of an unconventional shape. The smell is almost a sour aroma and smells of strong yeast. This beer has a delightful full bodied taste. You can really taste the barley, malt, and yeast with tones of carmel and is a fairly sweet beer. It has a somewhat tangy aftertaste. I drank this beer quite cold and it was very refreshing going down my throat. Smooth yet tingly at the same time. A fine quality beer, drinkable to say the least. This is a nice sipper beer and is a nice change to what i have been recently consuming."
"A great big, rocky head and a brilliant bouquet of figs, raisins, dried fruits and a hint of chocolate. Tastes just as good as it smells. Almost like port in it's intense mouthfeel. Could go on and on about this beer....but I won't. Just know it's really good beer!"
"What can you say? This beer is balanced enough yet bold with a smooth finish. The booze is hidden extremely well and leaves my palate very happy; an exemplary Belgian."
"D: A complex sipper to be sure. This being my first BSDA, I'm not sure how drinkable Grande Reserve is compared to other offerings in the style. Personally, one 11.20 oz. bottle and I'm done."
"I could drink a 750 of this without much of a problem, but I prefer belgians to share, the 750 size is perfect to take to someone's house for dinner as a wine substitute."
"drinkability: very very easy and smooth. I feel like a king when I drink it"
"Yummy! Tan head started fairly large and quickly dissipated. Left very nice lacing. Smelled a little sweeter than I expected. A faint floral, earthy smell with a tad caramel. The feel of this beer is very nice... Definitely a substantial beer but the carbonation adds good balance. The alcohol content was very well hidden. I had the smaller bottle and wanted more pretty immediately."
"Drinkability - I could sip on Chimay endlessly, but as is the usual with Belgians, the drinkability suffers slightly from the overcarbonation. Overall, this one still holds up after 3 years in between last trying it till now. The one that started it for me still is a fine brew."
"Took me awhile to finally try this but today is the day. Pours a dark brown with some particulate even after carefully decanting. A large tan head forms and lasts a long time. The head eventually settles to a thick cap. Just a light amount of lacing is left on the glass. The aroma is a little weak but I do detect fruity esters. Not dark fruit which I was expecting but more in line with plums, grapes, and banana. The flavor is full of fruit and sugar. Dark fruit this time such as dates and figs. Sweet and floral with just a hint of alcohol. The body is surprisingly light and effervescent. One of the great beers of the world."
"Even a slow pour yields a pretty head that the glass helps to maintain. All kinds of beautiful stuff in the nose and mouth. Earthy notes along with ripe fruits and sugary sweetness. There is also some bitterness and alcohol kick, but only slightly. This is the Chimay flagship offering for a reason. Its complex and full of different flavors and aromas, but still manages to be very delicious. This is one of my favorite belgians without a doubt."
"PS. I tasted a 2008-born one."
"Lively foam when you pour it, races to evaporate into dispersed islands of miniscule brown bubbles, close to zero lacing. Murky muddy brown in color, more yellow tinges than orange or red, lots of floating particulate even with a careful pour. The nose leans a good deal on cinnamon, clove like spice and brown sugar for oomph, lesser degree on raisin bread, dry chocolate powder, dried apricots and peaches, figs too, light banana esters, not as forceful as expected, you have to work at drawing out the scents even though the glass has ""Chimay"" written on it. Full-bodied and a touch heavy on the palate, here the flavors deliver more depth. And while no heat, you can feel the alcoholic content. Clove, allspice, cinnamon spice and orange peel comes at you first, notes of cola and brown bread as well. The carbonation is very aggressive, although not able to cleanse, more so add to the turbulence. Chocolate powder, yeast, raisin, fig, apricot, peach and banana fruit fit into the groove. Dry finish given its body and initial sweetness. Can't say I could drink more a couple in a sitting."
"Overall, this glass is almost done - quickly. Another beer that is a trip down memory lane, with over a decade between tastings. As easy as this goes down, I'm glad I can buy 12 oz. singles. It is just enough, volume wise. A very very enjoyable brew that you intend upon sipping and find yourself going back to the glass faster than anticipated. A great standard and not to be missed."
"D- A delicious beer. It is smooth and very drinkable with just a bit of alcohol presence. It is a bit pricey, but it is a nice treat."
"D) A truly well crafted ale. The good news is that due to superior marketing, this one is not too difficult to find. Enjoy often."
"Very drinkable, but spendy."
"D - Very nice and easy to appreciate"
"Overall, not the first time I have had this one, and it definitely won't be the last. Belgian ales are becoming my favorite style of beer."
"very solid beer, not as exciting as the other trappist breweries but it's an excellent go-to beer seeing as how it's pretty widely available"
"D - Well hidden 9%, great complexity and sweetness.. easy drinker here."
"Tastes like a 6-7% not a 9%. Easy to drink. I could drink 3 or 4 of these easily and want more."
"A phenomenal beer."
"D - Again, surprisingly light and refreshing. Almost dangerous in this regard, and exceptional given the ABV."
"Medium to full bodied. Pretty smooth. Now I wouldn't be drinking a lot of this in one night, but this is fun to sip on throughout the night and definitely worth picking up again on another day."
"Overall this really is a beer that lives up the hype. I had this beer for the first time tonight in honor of my wedding anniversary, and I think I might have just started a new tradition..."
"D- I would drink this whenever I have the chance to pick up a bottle. This stuff is delicious."
"I would have to say it is the best beer that I have ever had the pleasure of drinking. It is so unique a flavor that it is hard to describe. It is a strong ale at 9.0% but, it is pretty smooth. I would not drink it all night but one bottle is great on a cold night in New England. The price is expensive but, don't let that scare you away it is worth every penny. Try it and you will not be disappointed."
"The head was nice and thick and the aroma was very strong right out of the bottle. The taste was nice and sweet with a great balance amongst the many flavors. The mouth feel was exceptional and since this is a pretty strong beer it will hit you after the very first bottle. Great beer that everyone must try!"
"Drinkability: This well done ale is one of the best BSDA I have tried. It is a sipper not a gulper. Its very complex maltiness is nicely balanced with hops."
"Overall this is truly all it is advertised by style: dark, strong, and Belgian. Definitely a sipper, but much more quaffable than others I have tried. Complexed and yet approachable, this is the perfect night cap. I wouldn't eat anything with it, but just sip in a chair and enjoy."
"Poured from bottle to snifter. Beautiful dark amber color with minimal light head and lacing. Cloudy appearance. Smell of raisin, dates, molasses. Taste seemed to follow along with smell. Nice malty taste with virtually no alcohol detected. Finishes smooth and sweet. Not as complex as one might expect. Easily drinkable."
"Unbelievable... Poured from a 750 this beer has a dark amber honey colored body with a light head. The taste is unparalleled to any beer I have reviewed thus far. Molasses, dark sugar and raisin with a smooth and excellent finish perfectly balanced with a slight and sweet malt flavor. This hits a sweet spot with an excellent carbonated mouthfeel. It is certainly a bit more medium bodied then expected and its drinkability is spectacular."
"All I can say is wow. Smooth, slightly sweet, not overpowering in any way. Exellent drinkability. Two inch head, minimal lacing. Dark amber in color. Touches every taste bud without overwhelming any one. Gonna cut this review short to continue enjoying. This is what a great beer is about!"
"750 into goblet. Cloudy, medium brown, thick foamy off-white head stays a while. Lacing doesn't last long. Very active. SMELL is spicy, coriander, yeasty, raisins and other dark fruit, fruity esters, very long legs. TASTE is sweet maltiness, dark fruit, Abbey yeast, bit of booze, and faint hop bitterness all blending and balancing perfectly. Very smooth, balanced, and complex. All it's cracked up to be. FEEL medium carbonation, med/full body, fleeting coating texture, bit of warming. Clean finish with a mild bitterness and drying sensation. OVERALL wicked easy drinker, doesn't really seem big, though it is. Main cause for restraint is the price."
"For a complex 9% abv beer this sure is clean and crisp with no aftertaste, almost as though this complexity comes and goes. Leaves you with ""what was that and where did it go, I need some more""."
"Taste is dark fruit, and is high in carbonation. I prefer my belgians a lot less carbonated. This is a well made easy drinking, good beer. Can't wait to actually put one down for awhile and see what some time does for it."
"Deep ruby colour, big creamy beige head, lacing, precipitation from the yeast. Aroma is full of yeast, sugar,dark fruit, and pretty unusual for a trappist beer som hops too. Flavour is full of sugar, alcohol, yeast and dark fruit, even though it is not powerfull there is more bitterness in this beer than is usually the case in this style. Mouthfeel is lively. One of my favourites of the trappist beers, will be interesting to see what happens to it with some aging."
"D - I'd drink it again, but I'd pick plenty of other BSDAs before this one. It's not even my favorite Chimay beer. Stick to Rochefort 6."
"Poured a ruby brown body with a small tan head that dies slowly, leaving little lace. A mild malt smell that is sweet and mixes with some minor citric hops/fruit and figs for a mellow, quasi-earthy smell. More medium than full-bodied, but extremely smooth and creamy, with sweet malts like caramel seem to be predominant but there are some roasted malts in there to balance it and give some dryness. Fruits and hops are lowkey but there is a hint of hop bite on the backend and a little spice. A well-crafted beer that one can put you down (ABV hidden very well). A classic."
"D, this is very drinkable easy to find and even easier to drink a great beer over all."
"D - I could drink this stuff forever."
"D: Very nice, even on a cold night. Been wanting to try this beer for a long time, and it did not disappoint."
"I've had this ale many times, but this is the first time in at least 4-5 years (and my first time formally reviewing it). It could be my pallet, but I'm willing to wager this ale has been dumbed-down as of late. I remember this ale bursting with flavor with lots of layers and complex as all get-out. The spiciness is still there, but the richness seems to have waned. This bottle is fairly fresh (I'm guess less than 6 months old) so maybe the ale I remember thoroughly enjoying might have had some age on it? Still, a very solid Quad from an excellent and 'heavenly' brewery. I'd never turn a Chimay down. Ever."
"D - the high abv is masked well."
"Update: the carbonation decreases and the mouthfeel thickens a bit as it warms up. Bumping mouthfeel from 2.5 to a 3."
"Overall best belgium dark I have had so far. I could easily have a few of these. The only think I don't like about this beer is the price :S"
"D: All of the Chimay triplets are damn near flawless. Great tasting, benchmarks of their styles. All very drinkable for the niches they own."
"It's worth the $13."
"Drinkability: Definitely a sipper. It's a little too cloying for my tastes, as the sweetness quickly overpowers and leaves a less-than-desirable aftertaste. Overall, it was a solid beer, I'm just not sure it's in line with my tastes."
"D: I would -- and will -- definitely having this again. However, I wish I'd performed a vertical tasting. From what I recall, the one-year aging tastes the same as a young one. I don't know if there is any point to waiting."
"Side note, I ate some toasted & salted almonds with this beer, and it was a freaking great combination."
"I'm surprised by this brew after having had Chimay Cinq (white) and having been halfway disappointed. I appreciate Chimay as a brewery much more after having tried this, I can't wait to get more!"
"I really like the richness being held back in this beer. This adds considerable to the drinkability (and it's scored relative to style). Good beer, nicely done."
"Mouthfeel: Nice, but a bit more carbonated than a beer like this needs to be. Best to let it sit a few hours before drinking."
"Other than that, it was a quality brew fo sho. I wouldn't buy it again, as there are so many other options I like better, but if someone wanted to give me one I sure wouldn't turn it down."
"This is a bit on the sweet side for my liking, but I am a IIPA and IRS fan, so I am used to the dry bitter stuff. Surprisingly good for such a widely distributed beer."
"The taste is so delicious and the alcohol so subtle that I'd love the chance to sit down with a much larger bottle of this beer."
"Drinkable complex beer."
"I love this beer, it's will always be one of my all time favorites."
"Notes: I know that I drank this within the past year but I guess my rating did not quite make it here to BA before today. A very good example of my favorite style. I have now rated each of the regularly available Chimays and I believe that I can say that I would recommend them as a sort of benchmark for their style as far as Belgians. The red, white and blue Chimays are all very solid."
"Dark amber, thick head. Tastes great, but I prefer the 'Tripel' or white label to this blue. Complex flavors of fruit and sweetness. Very pricy but this beer is meticulously brewed and its consistent taste is exceptional no matter which style you choose or prefer!"
"This rich, heavy bodied beer is light on the carbonation, leaving a lot of tongue coverage to help bring out the complex flavors. The flavors really come out as it warms, I'd almost suggest drinking at room temperature. Just an all around tasty, accessible Belgian ale that you can't go wrong with."
"Extremely well-balanced, with a high level of alcohol that is, though detectable, well-subdued and none overpowering. The balance makes this a beer that is never cloying in any aspect, but one with a wide array of complex flavors and aromas that co-mingle exceptionally. World-class and highly recommended."
"Poured a medium to darker brown color with a larger sized off white head. Aromas and tastes of plums and other dark fruits. Lightly spicy with light yeast in the tastes as well. Medium sweet."
"D- Easy enough to drink, but the carbination is slowing me down a touch."
"I found it quite resembling to a stout except for the colour ,less darker."
"Absolutely marvelous. This beer is a miracle. It has a 9 percent ABV but drinks like it is 5 percent, which could get you into trouble if it was less expensive. The flavor is perfectly balanced with just enough fruity sweetness and just enough hoppiness. I have had Chimay from the 750 and the little 11 oz bottle. I actually prefer the little bottle because I like the tighter carbonation in the mouthfeel better."
"Drinkability is extremely high for the abv. Probably smoother than any wine in this range, and likely as good or better than most beers in the range. One to sip in the light of your fireplace, good company welcome."
"Skip the Chimay Chalice and pour this into a large wine glass to allow for better agitation and outgassing of bottle conditioned carbonation, unless all you want to do is look at the beer."
"Fantastic taste, all the hints of the smell blended together on the tongue perfectly. Before I knew it I was done, this is a dangerously drinkable brew. At 9% and so delicious, a few could catch up to you quickly!"
"M - A nice touch of fizz lends some framing to what otherwise might have been a boozy, sweeter ale. This is a very nice drink but the 9% ABV hinders going much beyond a glass or so. Great for year 'round consumption and would be very nice with venison stew."
"Chimay Blue is a good beer -- outdone by its more famous rivals, but there is no denying that this is solid stuff and a great beer to start off with if you're about to explore Belgians. Not world-class, but nevertheless delicious and appealing. Recommended."
"D - Good. Though I'd probably stop at 2 pints. Not as drinkable as some other versions of the style."
"Another style that I'm relatively new to, and I can already tell that this will set the standard for future encounters. It may be a stretch to say that if you don't enjoy this beer then you don't enjoy GOOD beer, but it's the kind that every good BA should try at least once. Highly recommended!"
"Drinkability: I know everyone loves this beer, however I wouldn't consider this in my top 10 by anymeans. It is very smooth and extremely easy to drink, although I thought it to be a little gaseous. The abv is very well hidden."
"Drinkability: Very good. This is a very complex beer, unlike anything I have ever tried. Since ABV is 9%, it should perhaps reduce drinkability a bit, but actually, the alcohol hides rather well and primarily adds to the complexity of this outstanding beer."
"When you smell this beer you could swear that it is a port wine you have before you. The taste is similar to portwine but the body is quite alot thinner. This beer has aged with beauty and it was indeed interesting to see what 10 years could do to a beer."
"D - Tasty. Nothing too complex but a very good example of the style."
"MF&D - The carbonation is amazing and highlights the fruit flavours, I have no idea what people are complaing about the the drinkability, even as i sit now, reviewing this beer and drinking it, it is slightly warm and the booze should be kicking me in the throat, but it isn't. I love it, and could drink it until the Cistercians tell me I've had enough."
"Last week, thanks to MRMOJORISIN, I had the pleasure of sampling the ""millenium"" version of this - a 1.5 liter bottle with a 2000 sticker on it. Afterwards, we sampled a ""new"" bottle. I for one concluded that the 10 year old bottle was preferrable. The smell was very pleasant - toffee malt with grapes that reminded me of red grape juice. Taste was heavy on the sweet malt, with toffee and caramel malt coming to mind. However, it finished with a tannic-like bitterness. It would've gotten higher scores in both appearance and taste."
"This beer is a worn-in leather chair, with a good book and a fire that you can taste, and will remember."
"This beer is a real treat. At 10 dollars it will remain as such while i enjoy 7 dollar unibroues to get my belgian fix. However, this beer now has a place in the pantheon of great belgians that ill uncork for special occasions (along with chouffe houblon, duvel, and delerium)"
"Drinkability: This just HAS to be the closest one could come to the ultimate beer, nah what am I saying - it IS the ultimate beer! Make no mistake, to paraphrase the ever so wise Mr. Burns, drink it not only once, not only twice BUT thrice (ad infinitum)! Exceptional. Period."
"This is by far the best beer I have ever tasted. I have tried quite a few belgium dark ales and this one really stands out at the top. I am not that fond of their white tripel but this one is exceptional. I will be buying this one regularly and will be my go-to special occasion beer!!!"
"New years '09, I once again followed my new years party tradition and brought a beautiful, classic bottle of Chimay Bleu with me to celebrate revelry. Unfortunately the casino i was in on the strip made me pour into a plastic glass - tear. I hadn't had one of these since earlier in the year in France, but wasn't dissapointed. Great yeast, balanced malts, and rich beautiful wine-like deliciousness and complexity."
"D: Could maybe have a couple goblets, but too flavorful to have much more than that."
"I will definitely buy this again."
"Wow, what a beer. Big and complex, a real experience to drink. Something to savour. I'll have to put a few in cellar and see where they go. Can't recommend this beer highly enough."
"D: Hard to review, but easy to drink. Complex to the hilt, but all the flavors work harmoniously. Never becomes overly alcoholic or harsh. Recommended."
"Cheers!"
"I have had the blue all over NYC only available in bottles. Pours nice deep brown. Nose has a little too much alcohol for just smelling it. Flavor is nice malt. 9% abv is evident. Good overall, just not my fav."
"Served in my Chimay 25th anniversary glass. Pours a dark brown with a fairly large light tan head. Just stunning! Aroma is big ripened fruits, spiced malts and yeasts. Flavor is more on the tart side. Sourish malts, ripe fruits. Hints of banana and plum. As it warms the spices seem to come out more. A beautiful classy beer."
"taste is chewy, roasted nuts, spice, malt, prunes, figs, raisins, slight amount of cocoa, ends dry and just a touch of bitterness."
"Not a huge Belgian fan but this is pretty darn good."
"This is one of those beers that just gets better the closer to the bottom of the glass you get. The spicy pepper sensation at the end blows me away every time. Heavy brown sugar flavor early on and the alcohol comes to the top a little but not in an obtrusive manner. Very very tasty."
"Drinkability. This beer is truly a delicous beer I could drink every week. Glad I tried it."
"D - This was a really good a really good beer, very filing, but with enough flavor to keep you drinking, the Belgian Strong Dark Ale is a style I like on my first try, this beer will be a great introduction to the style"
"D: excellent drinkability"
"D- pretty easy to finish the bottle, but i wouldnt want to attempt another one right now. an often overlooked bottle because its so widely available, but one i should have more often."
"Drinkability: A titan of the beer world. A great beer to enjoy on Christmas. Always a pleasure."
"Just how good is this stuff? Let me put it this way: I have an uncle who is NOTORIOUS in the family for being very cheap and never picking up his part of the bill, and who (while interested in decent beer) isn't a beer geek at all. At the liquor store Christmas Eve, however, he never hesitated as he reached past the $13 price tag and grabbed a 750 mL bottle of this stuff. That's how good this is, and that's what kind of value it is."
"I'm cellaring a bottle of Chimay Bleue every year (for that year's vintage). hopefully I'll be able to crack the 2007 bottle in 20 years or more and review how that turned out."
"Served out of bottle, into North Coast Brother Thelonious goblet. I had this one a while ago, and it turned me onto belgian ales. I have to say, I forgot how good this beer really is. Sometimes I find the sweetness of belgian ales a bit overwhelming, but not in this case. Chimay Grande Reserve looks great, smells great, tastes great and goes down a lot easier than your usual 9% ABV beer. I can usually drink a 750 mL bottle myself without getting tired of it. Tastes of raisens, dates, and apricots. One of the first world class beers I've had and still one of my favorites."
"On 2-20-09 I opened a bottle dated 11-06. It was well worth aging. The taste was less sweet, was drier, and even slightly sour."
"Had this at my 60th Birthday dinner recently - and definitely the highlight of my day. Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a Chimay goblet. I was truly overwhelmed by how good this beer is - appearence, smell, taste, mouthfeel - all world class. This is a beer I will certainly seek out in the future. I only regret it took me until I was 60 to find it."
"Mouthfeel is full with a good amount of carbonation."
"One of the best beers on Earth, hands down"
"Another new favorite. I'll be coming back to this one with some frequency, when possible."
"A benchmark ale for this style and brewery. It just reeks of excellence."
"Overall. There was a slight astringent mouth coating with a slight bitterness following. The makers of the beer laced the alcohol very well in with the beer. I could hardly tell the alcohol was there. I was left quenching for more. I could not believe it, my mother actually like this beer. She is one who hate the smell of beer and the taste. I just wished I would have bought a few more."
"Highly recommended"
"Drinkability- decent; this beer is very deeply and complexly flavored, though the light, tart, crisp mouthfeel is mismatched by the weight of the beer in the stomach. This is very enjoyable, but drinkability isn't its strong suit, flavor is."
"Mouthfeel is thin and has little carbonation."
"Great beer, my favorite of the Chimays, has much more flavor than the other two. Highly recommend."
"D - easy to drink and even easier to enjoy. This is very much a beer to savor and respect."
"Drinkability: very high ...i could drink this all night"
"In my opinion, this beer is spectacular and lives up to the name. Now all I've got to do is try the other Trappists..."
"I have a beer book that says this beer goes well with a cigar and the next time I have it that's exactly what I am going to do. It pours a golden red-brown with a smell of sweet and spicy malt. The flavor is full bodied, sweet, and spicy. This one has a wonderful character without being too complex. This is a must have it you like Belgian beer."
"Probably my second favorite from Chimay. Nice sweet and complex taste, glad I gave it a try."
"A slight edge over Chimay Red (Dubbel)."
"D_Fairly filling and high ABV, coats mouth and begs for a water or refreshing brew afterwards."
"Mouthfeel is a little weak at first but has a nice crisp finish, and the drinkability like the other chimay's is very high. Overall I'd say if you're gonna go Chimay go Blue, or if you're eating and want something a little tamer go with the White."
"Considering the power of this beer, the alcohol is nicely balanced."
"Small bottle. This is one really good beer. Dark brown/orange pour with a pillowy off-white head. Fruity aroma of dried peaches, orange peel, prunes, and yeast. Nutty sweet taste rich in spice and yeast esters. Fazir amount of cherries, raisins, prunes that you would fing in any Belgian Dark. Finishes malty and crisp. I enjoyed it, but probably best enjoyed in the smaller quantity."
"Serving type: bottle 750!"
"Will drink again."
"Drinkability: An absolute must taste, the sheer excitement of popping the cork and smelling this beer easily tells you your in for a treat. This is a beer that gets better with every sip, even putting the bottle up to a light and seeing the fermented particles setting to the bottom of the bottle is a real sight to see. This is a beer that Einstein would have invented. This is one you sip slow, but is easily sessionable year round. An excellent brew from Chimay that should be tried by every beer lover."
"Drinkability: A true classic that is deserving of all the accolades it has received."
"4.0/5"
"This beer compliments the complexatiy of the other Chimay's, providing the alcholhol of the white and the flavor balance of the red. It is indeed the top shelf beer that it is intended to be."
"D: Extremely drinkable. Don't know what to add here."
"D: Those monks know what they're doing. An excellent beer that's best consumed in small doses. Definitely worth a revisit down the road."
"Drinkability: Also like the other Chimay beers, this is a top-tier beer. Definitely a sipper as well."
"The dryness is nice and its also good that it isnt overpowering with the belgian dark flavor."
"Taste is great what a great balance of spice, alcohol and malt. Finish is amazingly smooth and clean; a miracle for a beer of this dominant flavor profile. Mouthfeel is equally fantastic medium feel, carbonation, and coating in the mouth. Unbelievable...Not heavy enough for the beer drinker to get sick of it. Just enough to make you want more without being watery. That also sums up the drinkability. What a quality brew, I'm getting more of this one, this one will be aged."
"Taste is excellent, to me pretty bitter at first. Then comes a caramel sweetness and a great malt presence, with some spiciness as well. Aftertaste of roasted coffee, hint of chocolate. Not as grape- or wine-like as I expected, but there are some heavy dark fruit flavors. Extremely fine carbonation, very nice. Slippery, rich mouthfeel. Pretty much a winner in every way, though not as complex as some other strong and dark belgians I've tried."
"D: I would have another on another day. I wouldn't kick back 3-4 of these in a row. Delicious!"
"Drinkability is awesome. Each taste leaves me wanting more, just to figure it out. This is a very complex beer."
"D - good"
"Dangerously drinkable, astonishingly complex. Can it get any better?"
"Mouth feel was a little thick and a touch sticky. But neither were really negative characteristics. Drinkable in a ""must savor"" kind of way. I'll definitely have this again and really enjoyed it."
"Considering the alcohol this beer is very drinkable. I look forward to this beer everytime I have it."
"D: A wonderful warming alcohol and toastiness rounds things out making this an exceptional beer with wonderful qualities from the exceptional brewing techniques."
"The pour creates a pours a dark brown colored body, with an off-white head. Has an aroma of spices. The taste also has that same spiciness, with some roasted notes. Some floral taste too. Good, but, not as good as the red in my opinion."
"D: Very drinkable if you enjoy a sweet malty brew. I do, so I will be having another. This goes well on a cold night, sitting in a lazyboy in front of a fire."
"Notes: For me this is about as close to perfect as a beer could be. It is an absolute pleasure for all the senses."
"A classic. Although there are better examples of the style IMO, you can't go wrong with this one. Will gladly be buying this one again."
"If you haven't tried this one yet, what are you waiting for? There aren't too many others in this style that rise to this level. It is a standard to be judged against."
"D- Very drinkable for 9%. the alcohol is almost entirely hidden."
"Great drinking potential. Just watch out for the well-hidden 9% ABV."
"After almost 10 years this is still highly drinkable. Gotta love it!"
"Overall, a lot going on in this beer - definitely not a session brew you will drink all night, which should be expected when reaching for a 9% quad. Would recommend - next time I'd pour more carefully to avoid the large amount of yeast sediment in the glass just for my personal aesthetic preference."
"Pours a beautiful hazy medium brown with an inch of nice khaki head. A good amount of sediment in this bottle. Smells like figs, grapes, dates, it's dark and sweet. Taste is not as fruity as the smell leads on. A good body and feeling in the mouth. Excellent drinkability for the abv and flavor. This beer will always be a belgian favorite."
"The appearance is great, a deep cloudy burgundy brown, like a dark tea. Smells like dark fruits and sugars. The taste is similar but with hints of hops and and a warm alcohol after taste. The mouthfeel is tingly all the way down. I had high hopes for this since it was my first trappist and it met them. Probably the best beer I've had to date and easy to drink despite the rich flavor."
"Drinkability: Excellent beer, One of the best I've had in a while. Was sad when the bottle was gone!"
"Extremely drinkable. Maybe the most drinkable example of this style I have encountered. A great beer."
"D-A very pleasurable and drinkable sipper which I enjoy once in awhile when I am looking for this singular drinking experience. One of a kind."
"Needless to say, my friend was amazed at its taste as well. If only I can find it on tap ... I remember Cole's in downtown Los Angeles offered on tap; that's where I first fell in love with Chimay Grande Reserve."
"The price of this bottle of beer will probably keep me away in the future except for special occasions. It was great, but I don't see myself drinking it on a regular basis."
"A very good beer to drink when found and something I would definitely drink again. It is one of the few beers that is quite pleasant to drink."
"Tremendous beer, the only disappointment was the aroma, but it doesn't distract too much."
"Nice brew, but it doesn't really wow me, and I think I actually prefer the tripel to this. Maybe not really worth 850Y."
"D - Smooth and tasty"
"Comes out of the tap an opaque rich chocolaty brown with a thick, fine-bubbled head. Aroma is strong and malty, and has an undertone of caramel. Flavor is thick and mouth-filling, malty with strong smoky and nutty hints and a touch of caramel and sweetness. Finish is smooth and very satisfying. Better on-tap!"
"You'll have to excuse me for what seems like a dull review. This is a very nice beer that could use some aging. Carbonation seems high in the taste and I just think it would taste better if that mellowed out. Otherwise, worth a try if you like this style."
"D - Very smooth and absolutely delicious. The alcohol remains completely hidden. This is a great beer for those nights when you're craving something refined and complex."
"Overall, this is your classic sipper. This one's intended to be enjoyed slowly and savored - very nice."
"4.5 - I really dig all Chimay products, their history and the pay it forward feel-goody-ness that your consumption goes to a good cause!"
"D - Very drinkable. Don't be deceived, check out the ABV."
"D - Goes down well."
"Note: I am getting frustrated with my glassware and/or the way this beer might have been sitting on the shelf for a bit too long. I've got no head and no lacing on a beer that should have tons of both. I hand washed the glass with lots of baking soda and hot water and rinsed and rinsed, still the head just evaporates. I don't think my method of washing is off because this process has worked wonders before, I just don't get what is going on here. My only chance is to grab another, new looking bottle, somehow, and give this beer the second chance that I know it deserves."
"Drinkability is good. This is an excellent take on the style. Unique, and something every beer fan should try."
"God bless the monks that make this stuff! :)"
"Yes - this is a review of another beer I knew I would like. Why? Well - a number of reasons. One thing I absolutely love about beer is the story and/or process behind it. Chimay comes from a Belgium Monestary, and has been brewed by the monks since 1863 (1+8+6+3 = 18. My lucky number and Chai in Hebrew = ""Life and good luck"". Coincidence?) Anyways, Chimay was one of the first premium beers to my knowledge that started driving the prices of up - and made drinking beer, as sophisticated as drinking a fine wine. So - history lesson aside, this still truly is a great beer. Easy to drink - but don't EVER drink this from the bottle. It should still be cherished and enjoyed properly. This ain't no Budweiser (though - I do appreciate a quality Bud as well). Don't rush through this beer. Drink it slowly, but while it's still cold. Enjoy the sweet and malted scents and flavors. I have yet to meet a beer drinker that doesn't like this beer. It's pretty much a quality standard."
"Give this one a crack!"
"As long as you sip and enjoy this excellent brew it could be enjoyed all night."
"Dark, smooth, rich, and tasty."
"D: The critics don't lie. Fantastic - one I will definitely have again."
"I would say this is very drinkable"
"Don't drink and review."
"D: Easy drinking with great flavor I would drink thins beer all night long."
"D: This beer is a bit heavy in the booze as it warms, so I wouldn't want much more than one bottle in a session. Still incredibly well crafted in all categories and is so damned easy to enjoy. Very good."
"330ml bottle served in a chalice. Bottle conditioned. Poured a hazy dark amber with a thin off white head. Fruity aroma with some peppery spice. Medium to full bodied with some malt sweetness. Rich mouthfeel. More fruit in the flavor. Spice in the finish and the signature Chimay yeast flavor. A little hop bitterness in the finish as well."
"	When I was checking out all the reviews I've written the other day, I couldn't believe that I hadn't yet reviewed my absolute favorite Belgium ale Chimay Grand Reserve. I figured it was my duty to pick up a bottle on the way home and pick up a bottle to write about. I remember trying this about two years ago and not liking it very much, but my palette has since grown. I popped the cork on a 750 ml. bottle and poured a good sample into a Chimay chalice that I got last year in a gift pack. There wasn't much of a head once poured; I took great care not to disturb the yeast sediment resting at the bottom of the bottle. The color was a deep, rusty orange, with very little light penetrating the chalice. The aroma was sublime with hints of dates, figs and yeast. I had read originally that this beer was once only brewed at Christmas time, which does explain why this particular ale reminds me a Barleywine. The taste is sweet, almost like port with deep fruits and a peppery aftertaste. This ale is a champion and should be enjoyed as often as possible. Grab a bottle or two and sit down to enjoy a epic masterpiece."
"If i could afford it i would drink this everyday but being 10 dollars and over at some places i might get it again in a month or two. A very nice brew thats different and keeps me wanting more"
"The first time I drank this can be comparable to spending a night with young britney spears."
"D- For the 9%ABV this is unbelievably smooth and drinkable in large quantities"
"there's a reason that Chimay is the first thing people think when they hear the word Trappist, and this is it. A must try for any beer lover."
"Absolutely fantastic!"
"There is a very good reason why this is one of the greatest beers produced. Truly heavenly."
"Dark brown colored ale with a high rapidly fading foam.Aroma is spices and alcohol.Taste is raisins,bread and alcohol.I did not enjoy this one as much as the other belgians I've had the past couple of weeks.I am by no means saying this is bad!!Overall a decent ale that I would try again."
"A really exceptional beer. The cork has 11/05 stamped on it, so this is well over 2 almost 3 years old. There is really nothing wrong here and actually it might be TOO drinkable. I've been working on this bottle for less than an hour and it's nearly finished. So tasty and perfectly balanced - Chimay would make an ideal substitute for water! If only... Highest recommendation."
"Pours a dark copper color with red highlight...very nice looking beer that produces an off-white head that is quite fluffy...The nose is of dark fruit, sweet notes, toasted malts, and a slight touch of alcohol...The taste is sweet! literally... it is sweet, roasted malts are present, dark fruit, and spices. Alcohol is present."
"Deep hazy brown color topped with a nice thick tan head. Malty aroma with a spicy dark fruit character. A nice rich bold flavor that combines slightly sweet fruits, malts and brown sugary notes. A smooth full-bodied texture. A slight tart presence. I now have had the Red, White and Blue and while I'd give the Blue and White the edge over the Red but they all are top of the line beers. There's just not much wrong with this one."
"The flavor of this was the best, but the mouthfeel of the Red had a silky smoothness, which made it very interesting. I will probably get a large ""aged"" bottle of this Chimay Blue, as I hear it ages very well. I'm glad I found my way to trying this very popular brew."
"A bottle of Chimay Blue 2007 does not dissapoint!"
"This is a fine beer and one I'll probably revisit at some point down the road. Not something you'd want to drink on a daily basis, but nice for special occasions."
"Overall - I must say that this is the best beer I've ever had at a bar. Full bodied, complex, and very rich. A must try for any Belgian fan. It can complement a fine dinner or be served as a stand-alone after dinner treat!"
"Perfect creamy mouthfeel. Not too heavy, not too thin. Alcohol content is hardly noticeable at all."
"D= Incredibly drinkable and really hides its ABV well. Each sip left me craving the next sip. Though it should be a sipper, I found it impossible to make this beer last for very long. A classic!"
"Chimay Grand Reserve is a beer of wonderful complexity, great drinkability (really? 9% abv?) and high cellarability (wish I could afford to lay a few down)."
"This beer poured a deep opaque brown with no discernible highlights and a fluffy two-finger head that dissipated to a single finger with good lacing. The smell is complex with some earthiness, fairly heavy malt, and some spiciness and yeast. The taste starts off with some bready malt that gives way to some spiciness in the middle with a small hint of alcohol at the end for some pleasant warming. The mouthfeel is a bit thicker than watery with a nice slickness and medium carbonation. I wouldn't call this the most drinkable beer in the world, but likely one of the tastiest. I could imagine finishing off a couple bottles with a good rich dinner or a fancy cheese and meat spread."
"Those who profess to love beer, but have not yet had Chimay, should find and enjoy this brew as soon as possible. Tastes wonderful with good cheese, fruit and bread."
"Overall: This is what a beer should be like. Extremely drinkable even with the high 9%abv. Goes down very smooth. I enjoyed this brew very much."
"Edited, had one score wrong."
"Drinkability - Very good thanks to it's smoothness. High abv may hamper it after you get through a couple gallons. Overall a great beer!"
"Purchased at Kokoman Fine Wines and Liquors in New Mexico."
"D: Easily drinkable at 9%, one 750ml does the job though. Drinking anymore of this would be a waste, but very fun. 5.0"
"pours like liquid heaven a deep caramel nut brown color with a big maroon head, it looks like jesus himself crafted this brew. smell is fantastic, just full of malty yumminess, a yeasty aroma is also prevalent. taste is amazing. just a concoction of yeast, malt, and sugar wonderfulness. a world class beer."
"D: Wow! Don't know about drinking a lot, but complexity, warming finish could take me well beyond what is reasonable to drink in one session."
"Could drink a few of these."
"Not a bad beer at all, just had a few characteristics that bugged me. Worth trying."
"T&M- Has almost a roasted, nutty wood flavor mixed in with heavy fruit taste. Has some dark beer quality,with it's roasted malt flavor. Balanced well. The alcohol is for the most part mild, but shows up more as it warms. Goes down pretty smooth as the alcohol remains subdued and does not detract away from the drinking experience. Good work Belgium! I could see drinking this quite a bit, down the road."
"Split this between friends, and you'll be the hit of any shindig. Chimay Grande Reserve is the most complex of the Chimays I've tried, however the Dubbel remains a notch higher in terms of drinkability. Great brew, nonetheless."
"Can't believe it's taken me this long to get to this one. Pours a dark brown with ruby hues and is topped off with a prolific off-white head that recedes slowly and leaves a thin skirt of lacing behind, while the carbonation works itself out fairly actively. Smells of grapes, plums, raisins, yeasts, sweet bread, chocolates and caramel. Most apparent to the palate are the fruits, chocolates and spices. In the background lurks some esters, malts, hops, and a bready sweetness. A good hint of alcohol heat finishes things off. Mouth-feel is medium to full-bodied and the active carbonation makes it a bit crispier than expected, but a little creaminess still exists. Pretty drinkable, and would serve well as a gateway brew for the initiate into more complex beers."
"Poured this jewel from a bottle to my glass to present a log cabin syrup, melted tootsie roll/root beerish appearence. Smell = bold summer grapevine, roasted sugar and honey...say from a honey baked ham, cinnamon and sugar quakers oatmeal, and black licorice. Taste...hold up....a little warm...hazelnut, french roasted coffee, burnt marshmellow(if you've been camping w/ a authentic wood campire you know what i'm talking about), chocolate/caramel...milky way candy bar comes to mind. Mouthfeel: Bubblely at first at the top level of your gums, but it fades into a smooth overall state of oral bliss thoughout the mouth. I cannot believe I have put tasting this amazing trappiste biere due to it's high price tag, shame on me, shame on Ralphs and Bevmo for charging 11.99. I found this marvelous beer at the awesomest? liquor store in Rancho Cucamonga, Ca, Stadium Liqour on Foothill and Rochester Ave. for a reasonable $9.99. Salud!"
"So very good! I just love how different this is from any other beer I've had. Has some of the same malty characters as the Rochefort 8 but this has more of vinous, wine-like addition. A great dessert beer that I could sip all night."
"D-Very nice drinkability, almost like sipping a nice brandy. Possibly the best tasting beer I have ever had...absolutely delicious."
"One of the first better beers I ever tried and keep coming back to. This is my go to beer for any body who already likes beer when I try to go them into better beer and especially Trappists."
"33cL bottle served in a Chimay goblet. Pours an opaque dark brown with a creamy-looking tan head. The foam dissipates a bit, but a good half-finger lingers until the glass is empty. Smells of bready, tangy yeast, banana, sweet malt, some caramel, and spice. Flavors of dark, slightly toasty malt up front followed by spiciness. Very light hints of fruit later on. Strong metallic phenols lead to a tongue-curling finish. As it warms it tastes more and more like cola. The alcohol is well masked, with only a slight warming sensation as it goes down. Pleasant feel."
"First beer that I ever drank with the lady who would become my wife, 13 years ago now, and I'm just now getting around to reviewing it. I've always loved this beer. Some say that it is a shadow of its former self- I can't say for sure one way or another, as it has simply been too long since I've had some. I will say that I think it may lack a little sweetness and depth I thought it once had, but whether that is me or the beer I simply can't say. Pours a hazy brown with a decent head. Aromas of spicebox, alcohol, cream, and dark fruit. Not quite seemless, and the alcohol heat is definitely there. The taste is a bit deper, with some breadiness added to the equation and the flavors are more flawlessly integrated than the aromas as well. Nice mouthfeel with a bit of creaminess. Nice, but I think I prefer most of the other Trappist quads at this point over this beer."
"Pours a deep brown. Nice big fluffy head. Laces the glass till the last drop. Aroma is dark fruit raisin date plum chocolate yeast and a bit like red wine. Taste is great. The yeast and complexity is almost salty and beefy. A perfumey beef broth with a nice bitter and sweet balance. Finish is a bit boozy but is quick."
"Poured into the goblet a cloudy brown color, Off white head settles fairly quickly. Smell is absolutely amazing! Sweet malt flavor, raisins, fruits, dark bready aroma. MMMM!!! I've had some other belgian strong dark ale's that a really strong anise flavor that really turned me off, but not so in this one. Taste is amazing! Mouthfeel is smooth and moist, not harsh or bitter in the least. Finish is nice, doesn't linger any longer than necessary. This beer totally surpassed my expectations. As far as drinkability is concerned, let me say this. I've had many different beers, but never before has one made me want to rush out and buy a case of it. WELL DONE!"
"Pours a dark and cloudy raisin color with dense, fluffy, off-white head. Aromas start off smooth and creamy caramel like, raisins and other dark fruits, a vinous alcohol note with a very mellow phenolic ester overtone. On the palate, there's a dense malty sweet flavor that nearly coats the mouth, while nowhere near cloying. Some spicy alcohol notes blend well with the creamy Munich malt flavors. The finish is big and malty but with just enough bitterness to keep it away from being sweet. Carbonation is medium high, could be a touch higher. Overall, this is such a classic beer, perhaps only the second or third time trying, and one I hope to duplicate with my homebrew."
"I write this from the US under the influence of three Chamays - Enjoy people! One of the best!"
"D-I can't think of a reason that anyone wouldnt find this beer extremly drinkable and want another after the 1st."
""
"Drinkability- This originally was my favorite of all the Chimays, but after the vertical tasting, I'm not so sure."
"This beer was brewed as a Christmas speciality in 1948, and it is very reminicent of warm winter nights by the fire. Very much like a glass of German Gluhweine."
"D: a sipper, would go well as a dessert beer, and for special occasions. I am buying another bottle to age for my wedding. long live the trappist tradition!"
"Poured in a goblet. Dark, dark brown color. Two fingers of a dirty brown head, smooth and creamy. Dissipated moderately fast, left nice lacing. Smelled strongly of chocolate. Very full bodied mouthfeel, with a rich flavor. Not overly bitter, nor too complex to really enjoy. Quite smooth, which covered the alcohol content. An excellent brew."
"Drinkability is good as the taste is wonderful, however at 9% it may get ahead of you fast."
"This is extremely drinkable and enjoyable."
"Granted this is a limited review. I prefer to drink as I type. But I had this at a decent bar here in Gainesville with some fun people nearby, so I'm working off of memory. Off the start it's definitely a belgian, it looks great in the chalice in which it was poured. Dark; if you mixed purple, black and brown you might find this color. It had a tan/light brown head. Tasted as it smelled with dark aged fruits and spice, mostly clove, very tasty. This was rather drinkable and certainly wouldn't be offensive for even the unexperienced palate. A very high gravity feeling though. It wasn't quite my style. It reminded me of a lighter colored unibroue (which creates belgian style ales). Although I've seen and tried this style, this was my first actual belgian trappist ale. I have more belgians sitting in my fridge (westmalle, st. bernardus). I look forward to them but hope that belgian beers have more versatility, because this sorta gave me what I might have thought it would taste like... it did not deceive my pre-concieved notions."
"The drinkability is almost at 5.0 as well. However some of the alcohol makes itself detectable through all of this beers greatness."
"In my opinion, this is the epitome of Belgian brewcraft."
" I get the sense (from talking to people in general and not from the ratings on this site) that this beer is not as well respected as other trappist beer; and I feel that is more due to the fact that this is the most available trappist beer than any actual experience from tasting. Go get this beer! It truly is one of the better beers widely available in the US."
"This is pretty much my benchmark for Belgian Strong Dark Ales now, it's almost perfect in every way. Truly one of the great Trappist ales."
"D - Simiply a great beer, this is a standard of what a Belgium Strong dark Ale schold be, easy to drink and a pleasure everytime."
"D- I could drink these all day. You cant really taste the alcohol but i know it is going to hit me in a few. This is like drinking sweettarts if they made a drink out of it. And very smooth and crisp, i love it. Hats off to chimay."
"Amazing that this held up so long and still retains its essential character. Makes me want to go out and drink a fresher bottle..."
"We had to average our ratings: I (Justin) just don't like the fruity Belgian beers too much. Nick thought it was pretty tasty."
"D - Complexity makes this beer one to enjoy, study, and savor..."
"My first Trappist offering, and now I want to try all the rest. A renowned beer, not necessarily my favorite flavors or style, but certainly well-done and very impressive."
"enjoyable, but not sure if entirely worth the price. again - look out, as you might not notice the 9% ABV"
"Truly a brew to savor and enjoy. This will be a staple in the cellar to age and enjoy year after year. If only I can stand to let it sit."
"750ml poured at 50F into a goblet. Ruby brown with a white foamy head. Not the most aromatic nose. Some fruity malts with Belgian yeast and herbs. The taste was equally unimpressive. Nutty malts and some spicy yeasts and hops. The body is medium and has good carbonation. A drinkable beer, but nothing special. Highly over rated in my book."
"The beer poured a deep dark brown into the Chimay glass with a generous off-white head that didn't last near as long as some other Trappists I've tried. The aroma is full of malt and yeast, with a tinge of sweetness. The mouthfeel was full-bodied with a champagne like carbonation feel. The flavor was a combination of malts and fruits. A very good beer."
"D-Excellent blend of flavor characteristics, aroma, sweetness, dryness, and body. Very enjoyable...a rich bouquet of flavors with a body that has enough backbone to carry them, but is still light enough dance spryly on the palate."
"Drinkability: All kinds of decent, but, and this is between you and me, I'm more of a Rochefort man, myself."
"Overall, a great tasting beverage."
"By no means unenjoyable - a complex effort. Heavier than desired for mild flavor profile. Definitely sippin' material."
"D: I could probably have a couple of these, but the alcohol content and the overall complexity of this beer would deter me from multiples in one night. Pleasant experience overall; very enjoyable and good for savoring."
"Emptied into an oversized wine glass creating three fingers worth of light brown head. Had a dark black color to it with mahogany edges with little carbonation present. Smelled and tasted of cherries and mild malts. Another easy drinking high ABV Trappist beer."
"Kudos to the stores and bars attempting to cater to the better beer crowd by carrying this one; now take a couple steps further and look into some world class Strong Dark Ales."
"Such a delectable beer. I bought the three pack with the Chimay goblet in it so naturally I enjoyed this outstanding beer in their own glassware. Poured a brilliant black cherry color with a minimal head but no big deal. Nose had a pleasent dried fruit quality with a mild malts. Tastes was smooth and luscious for a 9 ABV beer with raison notes and a great hop malt balance. I won't get tired of this beer any time soon."
"Dark ruby/amber with a thin 1/8"" head. Smells of fruit and malts. Upon holding up to light, you can see the tiny yeast is completely suspended. It has an alcohol taste that isn't huge or overwhelming but one that mixes quiet well with the malts and dried fruit flavors. has a lighter version of a soda pop fizz one might find in store brand sodas. Still quiet smooth! Been awhile since I've had this beer. Always a great choice! My mouth says ""drink all day"" but my brain knows how fast that 9% catches up with you. Be careful but enjoy this one to the last drop!"
"A beer which is certainly worthy of being my 100th beer review! Seriously if you have yet to try this, stop what you are doing and go get some. It is a gem."
"Added 4/17/2008 - This brew continues to be one of my favorites. A word of advice: be careful where you buy it! I've come across quite a few bad bottles. I wouldn't be surprised if everyone who reviewed this beer negatively had the misfortune of getting a bad bottle."
"Drinkability: Its definatly a sipper. I sould have poured it into a merlot glass instead of a pint glass. You will want to sit and smell it repeatedly before sipping. The smell changes dramatically with warming. A delicious beer, will do business with again."
"Powerful beer."
"The mouth feel is exactly how you'd expect a Belgian Strong Dark Ale would be. The beer is pretty drinkable as well."
"Drinkability - I could drink this all the time if I had the opportunity. This was a truely incredible beer. I highly recommend you try it if you get the opportunity. You will not regret it."
"Overall, this is very drinkable. The alcohol is very well hidden. I could drink several of these."
"Pours a rich amber brown with an excellent half-inch richly carbonated head. Smell is a great blend of malts, fruits and molasses...extremely inviting. Taste follows smell with a lightly sweet quality with a brandy-like quality and an excellent tratness on the finish. Drinkability is excellent....extremely smooth with a great crisp finish. Mouthfeel is smooth, rich."
"Drinkability - I would drink this every day if I could. I am going to start aging my own ASAP and just wait for the goodness that will be there in the next 5-6 years. This is one amazing beer and if you ever get the chance to have one aged this long do it, no matter what the cost. You will not regret it."
"Note: This beats wines worth twice the dollar amount. The monks from Westvleteren recommend the Chimay Beers if you can not buy their famous brew. This Chimay is something special,do not look past it or take it for granted."
"Cheers"
"Taste is like most dark Belgians but with exceptional mouthfeel. The taste is tart apple, spice and plum. Some caramel and sweetness in the finish. This is one of the best. Very complex and appealing."
"The Chimay trilogy is complete. All three beers are worthy of a purchase, but the Grande Réserve stands above the other two. If you've been following my invite theme, you know I'm going to say to ""look at my previous reviews to see what you missed"". Good night everyone!"
"D: Like the other Chimay beers, this is very balanced, complex and exceptionally drinkable."
"M/D - Highly carbonated which dominates the mouthfeel. A very nice Belgian Strong Ale. Not my favorite Chimay offering, but still a very good beer."
"750ml bottle (25.4 oz) $12. 47 cents per oz."
"To me, this is your typical/common ""now-macro"" Belgian go-to beer. Will continue to buy & consume for years to come."
"This poured a dark, opaque brown with moderate tan head. It had a mild caramel scent, and tasted like caramel and malt with a bit of hops. It was surprisingly carbonated and watery, but had a nice long-lasting sweet aftertaste. Overall it was quite enjoyable; the flavor was delicious but the texture was a bit harsh."
"HV"
"Lots of vibrant carbonation that actually helps make this drink easier. It is very lively and not too heavy. The alcohol is hardly noticable."
"d-very drinkable due to the slightly dry feel in the aftertaste, leaves you wanting more. finished my 33cl in about fifteen minutes so i guess it goes pretty quick. didn't realize that it was 9% abv untill i was finished. can not taste the alcohol while drinking which i like in a Trappist ale."
"overall a drinkable brew but not one of my favorite Belgian darks"
"This is absolutely fantastic. The balance is near perfect. Subtle sweetness and the light feel made this a rather refreshing beer. Carbonation made for a little dancing on the tongue and complimented the overall mouthfeel. ABV is hiding somewhere. Drinkablity is too good. I suspect that hidden abv will show itself."
"Pours a dark brown and completely opaque with one finger off-white head sitting on top. Aroma is beautiful. Dark ripe fruits, a little yeast, sweet malt, and a bit of alcohol. Taste is great. Dark fruits, malty sweetness, a little breadiness, and a slight alcohol warmth. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and appropriately carbonated. Drinkability is moderate because of higher alcohol, but great flavors make for easy consumption and a pleasureable experience."
"Definitely recommended!"
"I waited a long time to try this beer but I will definitely have more soon."
"I liked the red and white a bit better than this one. I wouldn't mind getting another bottle and aging it. As it is, this seems overly sweet and not my prefered style."
"From an 11.2 ounce bottle into an oversized st. bernardus wineglass Pours a dark cloudy chestnut brown with a bubbly tan head that dissipates rather quickly into a thin covering that last the life of the beer. No lacing to speak of. Smells of ripe dark fruits, raisins, brown sugar, tarry tobacco, bubble gum, black pepper, and a barely noticeable alcohol note. Very carbonated and fizzes quite a bit when lightly swishing. Rich malt flavor that translates into plum, candied dark fruit, cola, caramel, with an alcoholic finish that seems to prevent any cloying affect from the rich maltiness. The mouthfeel has a bit too much carbonation for me but it doesn't seem too out of the ordinary for the style. This may also be part of the anti-cloying. The mild alcoholic finish is nice and warming. There is also some residual flavor and bittness in the cheeks after a few sips. I could have another and would love to pick out more flavors. Quite enjoyable and I would say drinkable for being a Belgian Strong Dark Ale. I would love to enjoy this with a nice aged blue cheese. It has the strength to cut through the sharpness and the complexity to create an interesting contrast."
"Pours brown/purple with a huge frothy white head. Wonderful floral aroma. Great balance of aromatic hops and rosted malt. Subtle combination of flavors, including vanilla, toffee, and dark fruits. Also has a vineous quality. Clean smooth finish. Beautiful, subtle, complex beer. A nice change of pace from the hit you over the head with malt and hops American RIS's and IPA's"
"Had high hopes going into this with all the reviews and it lived up to the hype. Pour was a dark red brown with a very quick to form thick head( could have been my pour) smell was somewhat fruity with big hints of yeast on the nose. Taste was wonderfull and the mouthfeel was very non offensive. Wish it wasnt 9 dollars a bottle but between this and delirium nocturnium id choose this any day of the week."
"D - Drinkability is very good. This is what I would look for in a Belgian Stong Dark Ale. Highly recommended."
"This is one of the first Belgian beers that I tried. I fell in love from the moment I took a sip. One of the best beers anywhere."
"D: A true sipper. Great beer!"
"Enjoyable and very drinkable, though not my favorite Trappist ale"
"D- Overall a good beer but not one that really seemed outstanding. It is balanced well and would be good to grab to maybe have with some duck or a dinner party or even to pop open to have with some cheese and fruits. It is one of the easiest to find Belgian strong dark ales but not one of the best, yet still good."
"D: perfect sipping beer,"
"Drinkability is average for a strong ale. It's not an everyday sort of brew, nor is it sessionable, but it's passable as a single serving. It was overpriced in my opinion at $7 a bottle. I would not have it again at that price."
"I plan on spending the rest of the evening with this bottle. Salut!"
" high quality stuff."
"D: Chimay's best beer, a classic, I think there are better examples of the style out there, but this is still really good. Serve at a minimum of 55 degrees."
"I love the balance of this beer. Lightly fruity, somewhat malty and can definitely taste the alcohol in the end. Something I could relax and slowly sip on while reading a book."
"Mouth feel is sweet up front with a dry swollow. A bit too carbonated. Aftertaste is alcoholic and spicy hops. There seems to be at least 6 ""layers"" to this beer. Very complex. BUt each sip is consistant until the bottle is gone. NICE!"
"D--Uh oh. Amazingly drinkable at 9.0! I can see this being a year-round favorite too."
"M + D: Smooth and rich... an excellent sipper, and another that would compliment some sharp cheeses very nicely. Well deserving of the reputation of trappist quality. Something I'd like to come back to and try again after some time in the cellar."
"I think this is the best example of the style I've had (with Rochefort 8 a close second), and significantly better than other vintages I've tried."
"D: I'm really starting to come around on the the Belgians. It sounds so dorky but I swear that the Westy's have opened my eyes. At 5-6 bucks a bottle, I won't be getting this very often but I certainly enjoyed it."
"Maybe the beer's too young to really flower, perhaps a few years in the cellar might suddenly unleash this beer's potential. But generally my sentiments are, ho hum and a yawn... and $11 for 750ml? My eleven bucks are better spent elsewhere... I'll try it again but let the beer age for a few years and report back then.."
"This is a good Belgian! It poured with a dark brown/black body and a big white head that surprisingly didn't leave a lot of lacing. The taste had notes of rich fruit, port, and spices with a dry and very warming alcohol finish. Just the right amount of carbonation is present. It's also very drinkable considering the high ABV. This one lived up to the reputation. It would be the perfect companion to a rich chocolate fudge cake."
"I think belgians are still growing on me, but I did enjoy this and the taste had some nice complexity to it. Easy drinking with mellow flavors."
"Chimay is smooth with robust flavor and aroma that makes this a dangerous brew to drink. After 5 of these babies, life becomes more interesting. Enjoy"
"Smell and taste were sweet dark fruits soaked in lots of booze. Pretty standard issue for the style, but it stands out by not being overly sweet or syrupy. Medium body with a fair amount of carbonation, the relative lightness makes this one pretty drinkable, especially conisdering the 9% ABV. I liked this a lot, but it didn't blow me away. I would like to cellar a couple and see where they go. Very solid and nice, not my favorite, and its reputation precedes it, so no need to even bother recommending it."
"Always worth it, how can you really go wrong with Chimay. There are other Belgian Strong Darks I would rather have but this is a solid go-to choice."
"Poured into a chimay goblet with dinner last night. Pours a mahogany red/brown color with light tan head. Very nice carbonation with small bubbles. Great sweet fruity aroma witha hint of alcohol. Taste is sharp at first and settles as it sits in your mouth. Great oaky malt type flavors. This beer warms me up as I sip it. Very smooth finish,a s the flavor is full up front and then dissapates leaving a slightly alcohol flavored finish. A great beer overall."
"Looks like a coke with a frothy mountanious head till you hold it up to the light where you can see the opaque off red tint. It's aroma is nice, but somewhat faint. The taste is beautiful, with just the right kick to make it fun. It goes down creamy smooth, the texture is perfect. To top this all off, the price is right! Bought as Chimay Ale: Peres Tappistes: Grand Reserve in Dallas, Texas."
"Smooth on the palate, with the moderate carbonation slicing through the full body. Great beer."
"Drinkability: Nice Beer, at first I felt the ABV was pulling thru to much thru the taste but as the beer got higher in temperature the sweet tones and flavor came thru. Drinkability is high but marked down for the level of alcohol taste that is present."
"Drinkability: Decent amount of carbonation, but still very drinkable. despite the 9% ABV. Gets better as the temperature rises with more aromas and tastes appearing."
"This aged beautifully. I really enjoyed it."
"Dark brown in color with a bubbly head. You can definately tell it is a true Belgian by the smell alone. Goes down pretty smooth although it is very strong in alcohol content. The flavor lingers on the palate. More of a sweet taste than a bitter. Very drinkable, but I recommend sharing the bottle."
"As I mentioned in my review of the Chimay Red,I bought this in a gift pack of all three Chimays,and of the three,this was the best IMHO.I am not saying I liked it mind you,but of the three I thought it was decent...just not a big fan I guess,I may give it another chance if I find it by itself,but I would not buy the three pack again just to get it."
"D: Not my mug of beer. Apparently I'm not a fan of this style at all. Maybe I'll try one again later to make sure. Anyway, the high alcohol level which manifests so blatantly in the taste make the Blue a no-go. I loved the Chimay Trippel, so this was a real dissapointment."
"D- The alcohol will knock you in the face... You definitely notice the 9% abv.... combined with the price, it's not as drinkable as I'd like for such a delicious brew."
"Served in a chalice, the beer pours dark brown with a half inch tan head. Lacing is OK, head retention is excellent. It smells like dark fruit, raisins, peppery spice, roasted malt and yeast. Taste is the same as the aroma, but the fruit and pepper really stand out. Mouthfeel/body is medium/full, it's creamy, rich and has zippy carbonation (maybe a little too much carbonation for me, but it works good in this beer). It's also very smooth and very easy to drink. Aroma and taste just gets better as it warms. Alcohol is a little bit noticable, although it does hit you later. I think this is a pretty good beer, I'd definitely buy this again."
"D - high alcohol makes it necessary to be modest. but then again, who's counting?"
"Surprisingly very drinkable for the ABV. Can't get enough of this stuff."
"This is a good beer to have on hand year round. I'd love to try it after a year in the pantry, but who has the will power to keep a bottle of this on hand without drinking it."
"Served in my Chimay chalice. Color was a dark, murky brown with burnt red highlights; definitely the darkest of the three ales. Fluffy white head subsided rather quickly settling into a thin consistent layer of foam. Ample, but light lacing with good adherence during the tasting. Immediately presents with a strong nose of dark fruit (plums, prunes, raisins). Taste similar to nose, and much more pronounced than in the Red & White. Mellow mouthfeel with just a touch of carbonation. Alcohol was very well-hidden (deceptively so), making this an extremely drinkable belgian strong. After sampling all three, Chimay Blue comes in a solid second."
"I've always loved the blue, but I think there are much better BSDA's out there... nothing really wrong with it, just there are some better ones."
"Easily my favorite of the three that I've tried from Chimay, Blue is stellar, a top-shelf Belgian hands down. I'll be sure to grab a couple more of these for the cellar. Don't pass this by."
"D: An excellent sipping beer on a cold winters night. It delivers a nice array of flavours and packs a warming punch with its 9% ABV - although you would have no idea unless the label said so! Not my favourite trappist, but the easiest to find and still an excellent brew! I will certainly continue to purchase this beer often."
"I bought this to try because it continues to be so highly rated. I was disappointed. I poured it into a glass so I could observe the head and it was quite nice. It smelled pretty good too. The thing that really turned me off was the taste. I swear it tasted like someone put about three packets of Sweet-N-Low in every bottle. I just couldn't shake the saccharine sweetness from my palate. This one is popular, but definitely not for me."
"D- Very drinkable despite the alcohol presence. The larger bottle would go down great amongst a group of friends."
"D- Good quad. Nice dark malts and flavors. Very tasty!"
"I especially enjoy this knowing that there is so much tradition and history involved with the Chimay brewery. This is readily available to me and is the best beer I have ever had."
"From a short, fat, 11.2 oz bottle copped as part of a Chimay gift-set from Gary's in Madison, this strong, flag-ship sample from Chimay was very full-bodied, thick, creamy, and had alot of character... Pours a thick, foamy head leading to a dark brown, prunish appearance... taste had hints of chocolate, prunes, figs, and other dark fruits including a slight brandy flavor... Very rich and deep taste with a good mouthfeel, and a 9% ABV that is so unnoticeable that it will certainly throw you off if you're not careful... The rich complexity of flavors and the appealing aroma really make this a world-class, outstanding brew... I personally really loved Chimay Red, but this was without a doubt a superb example of a Strong Dark Ale... Excellent stuff... Definitely recommended..."
"Had a 12oz of this over Christmas. A fantastic beer, and I wish I'd had the other Chimays more recently so I could draw more comparisons. Poured a moderate, somewhat cloudy golden colour with a fairly large, white, frothy head. Aroma was malty, mildly spicey, with slight notes of bubblegum and candi sugar. Flavour is excellent and enhanced by a fantastic mouthfeel. I've had this sitting around for quite a while, but it seemed very fresh and might even have been able to use another year or so of aging. Nevertheless, I really enjoyed it."
"So glad my bro-in-law got this for me for Christmas. I can't tell you how many times I have passed it by."
"Murky brown in appearance with some off white lacing. Smells of mainly dark fruits and yeasty spice. Tastes as it smells but with some cherries and malt. Flavors are light and soft. Has a very slight bitter finish. The 9% ABV barely showed up. Mouth feel is creamy and full. Lots of carbonation. Drinkability is damn good. A very smooth drinker! Recommended!"
"D - For it's strength, this is a remarkably drinkable beer."
"Overall this stuff is great, I'm glad I had the chance to try all three so I could taste, smell, and experience their differences."
"D- This is an absolute necessity for anyone who appreciates beer. Pretty darn close to perfection. Not much else can be said."
"A great dark belgian ale. Although, I think I am one of the few who prefers the Chimay Tripel."
"A 33ml serving from the blue labeled bottle. $3.99 every day from Fargnoli Distributing (Sam The Beer Man) in Binghamton, NY. Pours a slightly darker chestnut brown color with a loose, full finger, light tan head that fades fairly quickly. The smell is more reserved yet deeper than the Achel ""Claus"" product that i recently sampled. Visibly effervescent, as evidenced by small pools of surface disturbance with a bit more lacing. The mouth feel is notably creamy, in the same manor as the Achel Claus. The flavor is figgy but less pronounced than expected. The 9% ABV has a warming characteristic that is more noticeable than my favorite Strong Dark Ales. The dark fruit flavor is wonderful yet less pronounced than anticipated. A good drinker with significantly less character than Achel - Achelse Kluis. I guess ""you get what you pay for!"""
"as per usual, this is a very enjoyable beer."
"Poured this beer into my chimay chalice. It poured a dark brown color with a tan 2-finger head that shrank down to a nice collar and had a good amount of carbonation throughout the duration. The smell was of fruits and dried fruits. With just a touch of date and cherry. The taste was exquisite, the fruity yet malty combination was perfection. The alcohol can really be felt about half way through, but it is not overpowering and leaves you wanting more. I would definatly recomend this beer to anyone looking for a quality belgium beer."
"Final Note: I went through the Chimay Red, White & Blue lineup and this one was clearly my favorite. I will most definitely buy this beer again, highly recommended."
"D: High abv, but outside of that I could drink this one all night, and look forward to it. My favorite of the Chimays."
"Pours a cloudy dark brown with a good head that quickly recedes. Nose is heavy on the alcohol with a large sweet tone to it. Small yeast edge to it. Taste is smooth and sweet with a malty undertone. Feel is bubbly. Probably the smoothest drinking BSDA I have had to date. Extremely drinkable. Even with a 9% ABV. Overall it's good, but it isn't my favorite of the style."
"750 ml bottle. Pours a dark amber with a 1 cm tan head that is mostly lasting. Aroma of cherry and raisin predominate with some sweet malt hanging around. Initial flavor is some dull fruitiness that becomes dry and yeasty on the back end. The alcohol comes through as it warms, but never terribly noticeable. Medium to full mouthfeel, moderate carbonation, warm and clean finish. Drinkable in the sense that you could have a Belgian night and work it in, but too distinctive to mix with other styles."
"Goût sucré de bananes, de pain d'épices, de fruits rouges le tout très moelleux et liquoreux. Toutefois, pas d'excès : cette bière est remarquablement bien équilibrée, et son fort % d'alcool est dissimulé à merveille."
"This beer is getting better as it warms even more. More malt flavors are coming through with a somewhat pleasant syrup taste which is definitely acceptable."
"I had this 750ml bottle corked and caged ready since September. I opened it up and shared it with a few friends right before a final exam. In hindsight, that probably wasn't the most responsible thing to do, but we all had a bit, so no big deal. Poured out a dark color, but more noticeable than its color was its high carbonation and frothy head. Tasted very fruity but with an alcohol and malty-sweet kick. I can't quite put my finger on what the fruits were, but it was definitely fruit-sweet with malts. It was almost wine-like in that regards. Overall, I didn't particularly enjoy this because of the overly sweet taste, but it was significantly better than the last belgian strong dark I had."
"Overall: This is a nice, well-balanced beer. Yet another reason why belgian Trappiste beers have such a large following."
"This is a very nice Belgian Dubbel. The beer pours a cloudy, dark, chocolatey color with a light brown head, some retention, not much lacing. You will find that very typical yeasty carbonation from a Belgian, along with some candied sugar fermentation. The smell is okay, not all that pronounced, but you'll get the aroma of plums, cherries, spices, malts, and very typical Belgian candied sugars. The taste is very smooth, fruity, some spices, a bit tart, like green apples, but it is mostly the caramel, plum, cherry flavors that come through strongest. The down side to this beer, and it is a relative shortcoming, is that the consistency is rather light bodied for a Belgian Dubbel. I was expecting a much more robust, hearty, more syrupy beer. The alcohol is warming, it doesn't have that strong throaty finish, and the aftertaste is just right. It's been awhile since I've had a Chimay, but since my first experience, I've had better Dubbels. L'Chaim."
"D: This beer is really good. Better with food or after a meal, but the half bottle I had with this review went down about as good as any other beer has ever went down. Drink up."
"Overall, I actually prefer the red."
"Appearance is mahogany dark brown with fat thick carbonation bubbles forming a thick luscious off white head. Smell is pungent of Belgian sugars, molasses, and dried cherry. Taste is much the same with a lingering of the sugar and cherry qualities. A little bit of carmel in there. This baby needs to finish puberty, but I couldn't wait. Months of mediocre Maerzens and Pilsners have left me dying for something different. Mouthfeel is full and smooth."
"Pours a deep, dark brownish-red color with an immensely billowy head that sadly resides too soon. Overwhelming notes of carmel, dark fruits, yeast and dough hit my nose almost immediately. The taste is of dark fruits, yeast, dough, carmel and simple roastiness. It's dryness actually accentuates the caramelized flavor quite well. All the flavors seemed to be accompanied by a sugary sweetness of molasses/ dark syrup. The Blue has a fairly full body that is nicely balanced by a surprisingly moderate amount of carbonation. Still goes down silky and leaves your mouth dry. Incredible beer...I would love to age this guy for a while and try it again."
"d: I'm not sure why, but it took me a long time to get around to trying this. I can't wait to have another."
"Anyone who is a fan of belgian beer won't even be reading this as they will probably have drank about 100 bottles of it by now. So for those of you getting into to the belgian game, this is a great starter. It is a classic example of an abbey dark strong ale. pours dark brown and with a nice head. tastes of classic belgian dried dark fruit and has an incredibly smooth finish with nice spicy taste on the finish and the 9% abv is unnoticable. good carbonation, and mouthfeel is just right. this is also a good first bottle for those looking to start a cellar. try to get it in a magnum if you can. good brew. belgian classic."
"Drinkability: I often worry that I will be let down when I try great beer, but this is a truly wonderful beer, worthy of its acclaim."
"Easily one of best, if not the best, Strong Dark out there..."
"Drinkability: Impressive brew. Simple, yet complex. Classic."
"D  This is a beer that I will definitely buy again. It is the type of beer that you could sit down on a nice weekend evening and enjoy the mellowing effects. It is also something that I will for sure recommend to friends."
"D - This is an easy drinking brew this is going to be a beer that I get to treat myself to on occasion"
"Overall, a good, typical trappist dark beer. If you like the trappist style you will like this one. A good example of the appellation."
"Bought two of the 03/07 vintage 75 CL bottles...saving the other one for Christmas..."
"Poured from a bottle into a Chimay chalice. The beer pours a dark amber/brown, forming a thin white head that fades quickly. Light spots of lace on the glass. The aroma consists of a noticeable alcohol presence, yeast and spices. The taste is a complex mix of yeast, light dark fruit flavors, some spices, a good balance of hops and malts, and a light alcoholic finish. Smooth medium mouthfeel. If it werent for the high abv., this would be a great brew to drink all night. The full flavor and smooth taste make for a highly drinkable Belgian. Overall, I really enjoyed this beer, and not at all dissapointed. Recommended."
"I have to admit, I am a little baised when it comes to reviewing this beer, it happens to be one of my favs. I had a twelve oz bottle of this today and was pleased as usual. I highly recommend this beer to all my friends and do not skimp when purchasing, I still have a couple of bottles left and do look forward to drinking them. The only problem I have with this beer is the price and that is all"
"Smells of some sort of fruit. The smell matches the taste. Its not overwhelming or very strong. For the price, its an O.K. beer, but its worth picking up if you are looking to live large."
"Tastes of sweet fruits with alcohol, spicy and earthy hops, strong malt presence and a warming finish. This is one if the beers that got me into Belgian beers and I am always glad to have it."
"Poured a 33 cl bottle into a Chimay Chalice (thanks gift set). The final of the three, I saved the blue because its my favorite color. Stupid reason, I know. Poured a dark mahogany with a nice billowy head, didnt leave much lacing down the glass though. Smell is of yeast, spices, figs and alcohol. Taste is of figs and raisins but has that nice alcohol burn at the end. It really surprised me. Mouthfeel was full bodied with a slight amount of carbonation. Lingered in the mouth for a while. Drinkability was good. I honestly think I would rather drink a red cap."
"Yes sir, mighty fine. I poured this big boy into my tumbler at 50 degrees. The poured a nice mohogany color, cloudy with a large tan head comprised of nice fine creamy bubbles. Very pretty. The beer smelled sweet like candy with toffee and dates. Initial hit was kinda strong on the alcohol burn but that calmed down on following hits. A little sweet but a beer i will buy again."
"I popped a bottle of this just for the hell of it. it was dark brown-red with a fluffy, billowy head. It smells like dark fruits and yeasty. Good yeasty fruity flavor reminiscent of the Chimay red. This was good but not my favorite belgian, I prefer tripels."
"Md-light body and fairly carbonated. Quite drinkable, not the ponder-bomb I thought it would be."
"D- For the high ABV, I would session this beer on taste alone... Like most belgian beers in my book."
"Highly digestable offering. Mouthfeel is crisp and smooth at the same time. I love having this beer during this time of year. Simply a classic and a great starting point for anyone wanting to enter the great world of Belgian ales."
"This is truly a fantastic beer. I now look forward to trying the others in the line. Hopefully they will be as enjoyable as this one."
"D: Still a little too sweet for me - I don't think I will buy again. The red Chimay is much better in my opinion."
"750 bottle, 2006 vintage. Poured a dark red-brown with a nice & dense cream-colored head. Smelled of reconstituted dried, dark fruit (prunes, raisins), brandy, and spicy hops. Tasted like heaven -- chocolate, plum, port, hops. I'm not sure past that -- just deliciousness. A bit too fizzy for me, though -- despite being incredibly drinkable (no idea that it's 9%), the fizz burns my throat a bit. Irregardless, one of the world's classic beers."
"D: Not so much...was this bottle bad? Or is this how it is? We were very, very disappointed with this."
"You have to give the Catholic Clergy their due...this is an exceptional brew...one that must have been contemplated with deep reserve...the nose is wonderfully light yet very complex soft fruit, herb, malt...the taste is wonderful, there are not many beers you will ever taste that can be said to be very similar to Chimay Grande Reserve...it is very balance with beautiful slight bite of the above smells of fruit, herb and malt...chimay is so sophiscated it is indulged like a glass of wine."
"650ml bottle from Vons. Pours a dark cloudy unfiltered brown with a tan head that disappears somewhat too quickly. Aroma is complex with caramel, cinnamon, root-beer, oranges and yeast. Flavor is nutty with almonds and walnuts in the forefront; anise, oranges, yeast in the middle; and mild hops bringing up the rear. Mouthfeel is full, creamy and smooth. Finish is long and satisfying. An Ale for the Ages."
"The end of my Chimay trilogy. Poured from bottle into Chimay chalice. Very thick, off-white head at first but it didnt stick around for long, a thin layer is left behind and no lace. Very deep brown, looks black in low light but more of the rich brown color. Smell is great. Smells of bread, apple, raisin, some yeast, and a little roasted grain (fruit being the dominant smell). Taste is on par with smell. Some fruits, grain, and a touch of alcohol, there is a definite earthy overall taste to it. Moderate carbonation and a somewhat creamy mouthfeel to it, leaves a relatively dry feeling in the mouth. The alcohol is hidden well but be warned, it will sneak up on you."
"D: It was full bodied with a smooth rich balanced presence and a clean finish. This may be best as an after dinner treat or a night cap. Two or three of the 750s would make a full night of joy for me."
"D - Alcohol pretty well disguised and the taste is not overly taxing on the senses. It would be easy to drink quite a few of these."
"D - A fine after dinner beer that's great around the holiday season."
"The blue pours a dark amber with a nice foam head an no lacing. The smell is terrific malt dominated aroma. I smell a little brown sugar and faint orange smell The taste is really smooth and it finishes sweet. Overall one of the best Belgian's I have tried to date. I would recommend this one to anyone."
"I don't drink too many Chimay beers, mostly around Christmas. However, I did get to try this one out for the first time recently. The taste is great, really fresh. Good head and nice appearance. This is a beer you just want to sip and enjoy. I really enjoyed it and I'll be getting more in the future."
"Review added 10-27-2007, translated from french 2-26-2008."
"Because its Chimay Blue Cap. Really one of the true classics Blue Cap really does a good job of promoting the high quality reputation the monks have made for themselves when it comes to making beer."
"Very smooth and creamy has a light mouthfeel,velvety with some pleasing tangyness. Soothing beer goes down almost too easy. Very enjoyable haven't had this beer in a while almost forgot how great it really was. Won't wait this long again before I have another. Would be a great winter warmer beer. Must try beer."
"The cheese by itself is a bit much for me. I top out at a good Stilton for strong cheese. But, followed by a slow pull of this beer, the cheese becomes the perfect compliment. A nice combination all can enjoy."
"D- This is a very drinkable beer. I love this one. I could drink it all day if I had the stock. Stong brew, but very well hidden in the taste."
"D- I find this more drinkable as it warms. The 9% ABV does not hide in this one at all. It is a complex and enjoyable Belgian ale meant to be treated with care. Good and something I am willing to revisit-but not sure it is worth $5 for a 11.2 oz bottle."
"I drank some of this on it's own, and then had it with some Chimay cheese... oh my god, the combination is fantastic. The cheese has a smoky burnt flavour, and then you taste the beer and the wonderful sweetness comes shining through."
"Dated 2006, 750 ml. bottle. Dark, reddish/brown pour. Sweet, slight chocolate, carmel and very, very faint coffee-ish flavor, maybe a touch of raisins. Soft and warm mouthfeel. Alcohol is hidden well. All in all an excellent Belgian Strong, it lives up to it's reputation."
"Overall. This finished last behind the Rochefort 10, Westy 12, and Abt 12. Another truely a world-class beer (as were the others) that's probably the most available of teh four we had. The flavors and aroma are not as pronounced as the others, but it's still damn good. Pick one or more up and see for yourself."
"Side note: I once paired this with some pulled pork and tomato barbecue sauce featuring molasses and it was outstanding. One of the better pairings I've encountered. The spiciness and sweet malt blend perfectly."
"A very good beer indeed, the cheese from the Monks also helped to intensify the flavours, try them together if you ever get the chance."
"M/D: Full creamy body with light carbonation, pretty drinkable for 9%."
"Nice finish and mouthfeel."
"D: One of those rare beers you could pound or sip with equal enjoyment. Sipping is preferable...but sometimes you can't help yourself."
"I can't wait until I have a dinner party and crack open a big bottle of this instead of a red wine! Like many high alcohol beers, my opinion of this got better the warmer it got. Definitely better than the red (which is also very good), overall an excellent Belgian beer. Widely available and reasonably affordable for a trappiste beer, so I reckon the value is good!"
"It's medium to full bodied, with mild carbonation and some detectable alcohol. I think I'm not alone when saying I tried this Chimay last among the red, white, and blue. I'm not sure why that's true, but I think I like this one the best."
"D: This is a very drinkable beer. Quite tasty, and definitely worth drinking from time to time."
"Im still a bigger fan of the red than the blue, but this is still a beer i will enjoy everytime i drink it."
"A beer which continues to impress. I haven't had one of these in a long time, but the more I have, the more I like."
"I've had this beer many times and will continue to sample it.I usually like to chill it for a hour or two before popping the cork. I like the Chimay Red better though. You need to pour this into a Trappist chalice and enjoy the sweet aroma. Take that first taste and enjoy the many flavors. This is a quality beer and worth enjoying any time."
"Very smooth in character and hefty enough in the abv content to keep you smiling till the next."
"From a 330CL bottle purchased in Beaufort NC. Poured into a snifter at around 50F. Medium head, looked pretty nice in the glass then went away to a thin coating as the glass progressed. The first one I poured the whole thing and wasn't impressed with the taste. Found out by reading the website to leave 1 cm in the bottle for the yeast sediment. Oops. The second one I tried had a great taste, medium mouthfeel and good drinkability for such a strong ale."
"Aftertaste is dry and slightly bitter but mostly alcohol."
"D- fine sipping brew, well crafted, just not my thing"
"Pours dark ruby with a great head that melds into ""rolling hills"" as the head ever so gradually dissipates. There's a pungent yeast aroma. Slight amount of fruity esters on the nose too. Fair amount of carbonation. Goes down the hatch fairly smooth for a 9% a/v. Either this beer is fairly bland or I just have a hard time identifying taste qualities in Belgian beers. I get a little sour tartness and a deeply hidden candied apple taste. I don't get much more. It is a very drinkable high alcohol beer without a lot of appealing flavors in my opinion. Blasphemy I know being such a highly regarded Trappist brew."
"Pours a hazy copperish red amber with a creamy white two-finger head. Lacing left all over. Aroma is very inviting, with hints of fuity esters and a nice grassy hoppines exudes from the glass. Taste is right on the mark, with a great balance of subtle banana and spice notes and a great hoppy bitterness, as well as piney grassy flavor. Mouthfeel is slick and refreshing, with a definite alcohol presence. Overall, this has become one of my favorite beers, and is easier to drink than Chimay red label. I recommend this beer to anyone wanting a good benchmark beer to start off their ardventures in Belgian brews."
"This is good stuff."
"Oh...Belgian beers have ruined me or more aptly, they have spoiled me. This in my opinion, is a top ten beer in the world. A true trappist beer, very few compare. Only the legendary St. Bernardus Abt 12, Prior 8, and Rochefort 10 would be rated better in my eyes, and not by much. Try this if you can, it is fairly common and can be found easily."
"note: i know i was generous with the 5's here but i love european water. this shit is quintessential. i dare...no, i double dare anyone to make a belgian ale better than chimay cuz u just can't do it son. the monks have it locked down. see ya in paradise."
"Slick but not terribly thick, medium carbonation keeps the tonguefeel light."
"25.6 oz ""bomber"" bottle with a cork dated 03/07. Pours a dark brown iced tea-ish color with an of-white version of the standard huge belgian head. As the top of the head begins to diminish the hundreds of tiny bubbles rising in the tulip glass to the bottom of the head replace what vanishes. The aroma is of malt & dark fruits. The flavor is a dry malty fruitiness with a fizzy medium bodided mouthfeel. Alcohol becomes more noticeable as it warms up, but it's not overpowering. Great beer, just a great beer. If you see it, buy it!!!"
"I would want to try a properly aged Chimay Blue. For now I still prefer the contemporary Chimay."
"Edit: as the drink warmed up some it unlocked some more of the drinks potential. More of the fruit unlocks toward the beginning of the drink instead of just the middle, and the spice picks up a little while the warmth stays!! Good drink while Ice cold out of my fridge and GREAT when it warms up some."
"I love Belgian Tripels -- now I have fallen in love with the dark side as well."
"Had this beer as a part of my MBA list. It poured a dark amber body with a decent, off-white head that had ok retention, slowing down later to a nice lacing. The smell was that of sweet malts that was very pleasing. The taste was interesting. Since it was a belgian, I knew it was going to be fairly alcoholic (i.e. the 9 %). The initial taste reminded me of a green apple: a sweet yet sour taste that your palette adjusts to. Once it does, the taste becomes more sweet than sour. Towards the finish of the beer, there seemed to be a refreshing taste to it, almost like the feeling your mouth gets after you have had some mint gum. The body was nice, smooth, and full-bodied. This beer went down nice and easy, but it definitely hit me later. While being good tasting, smooth, and nice to drink, the high alcohol content is almost like a sleeper. It sits and waits and when it hits you, it hits you pretty hard. Overall, solid beer and recommended."
"Got a 750ml bottle gracefully ageing in the beer closet."
"With good 4+ years on it, this is the crème de la crème of BSDAs. What more can I say, other then I need to get away from the computer, sit down and really savor this bad boy. Good thing I've got a whole magnum left!"
"A sipper, but one I'd gladly have again and again."
"D- Although the 9% alcohol is definately there, I did not find it to be overpowering at all. Before I knew it all of the 750 mL bottle I purchased was gone. This was definately a delight and I will be sure to have many more of these as time goes on."
"Pours out a bubbly ruby with a thinnish tan head. Leaves some spotty lacing. Smells a touch like sweet wort with lots of fruit, both fresh, tropical ones, and dried ones. Alcohol kind of jumps at your nose a bit. Taste is chewy dark malts mixed with banana, orange, and grape. Phenolics are mild and allow the dark malty character thrive. Finishes slightly drier than the middle and ends with some toasty character. Hay-like hop flavor is mild in the end as well. Mouthfeel is not heavy at all, nor is it slick. Carbonation is pretty active. Awesome BSDA, but it gets kind of sweet as the beer drags on, just slightly hindering the drinkability."
"Fabulous stuff. For my money, much better then the red or the white."
"D - This is one of those beers that you sip slowly and cherish, but when the bottle is empty you feel... well, sad. An outstandingly drinkable brew that even my non-BA parents enjoyed. I could drink this all day (and at 9.0% be asleep by 8pm)."
"This beer was tried on July 27, 2007 at the 'Beer Bistro' in Toronto. The beer poured a deep dark brown into the Chimay glass with a generous off-white head that didn't last near as long as some other Trappists I've tried. The aroma is full of malt and yeast, with a tinge of sweetness. The mouthfeel was full-bodied with a champagne like carbonation feel. The flavour was a combination of malts and fruits. A very good beer."
"A trappist ale I will come back to."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: Velvety soft on the palate, this one spreads on the tongue with little carbonation. Makes you just want to drink more and more, which is bad because of the 9% ABV on this."
"D: It hides the alcohol very well (though there is a nice slight warming). However, it's such a big taste, I wouldn't want (and don't need) many."
"I really like the strong dark ales this is one of my favorites. Not the best BSDA but at least 2nd or 3rd. Appearance is murky brown with a small foam head no lacing. This beer tastes great; with a 9% ABV it is pretty filling but the alcohol is well masked. Mouthfeel is light with a bit of a blueberry plum taste fading to caramel. Smell is of a caramel coated fruit orchard w/ lots of malty goodness, mmm. I could drink a lot of these even w/ the high ABV! WOOT WOOT!"
"(Barely) Short of fantastic."
"Poured an attractive brown color with an off-white head that hung around a long time. Malty aroma of caramel and fruit. Rich and oily mouthfeel. Alcohol content well hidden. Perfect amount of carbonation. Really excellent beer and a style I need to explore further."
"Update (7-16-08) from a ""champagne"" bottle tasting after nearly two years in cellar (the bottle, not me): Light mahogany clouded ruby with good off-white beige head and solid lacing. The aroma is a pleasant raspberry and malt chocolate. A smooth cherry malt, raisin and dry earthy hops flavor. Sprite carbonation, flavorful and quite drinkable. Nice."
"Picked up a 750 ml corked bottle for a Friday night. The cork said it was a 2006 vintage. Poured into a Chimay chalice, so I managed to get about 2 and a half glasses out of the bottle. There was a nice head upon pouring, and color was a dark red. Taste was very enjoyable. I've had better Belgians, but for a readily available beer, this one is superb. It was a bit lighter than I would have expected from a strong dark ale. On the other hand, this made it quite drinkable, I drank the whole bottle myself and barely noticed the 9% abv. Chimay Blue is a quality beer at a excellent price for a Belgian."
"d: as stated, very smooth and very enjoyable. admittedly not as good as i remembered the 1st time around, but solid nonetheless. things could be much worse if you're only choice is chimay."
"This is by far my favorite Belgian beer. If you can come across a properly aged bottle, which is very hard to do these days, the experience is even greater! There are some exceptional Trappist brews out there but when you consider quality, availability, and cost, this one tops them all!!"
"I see this beer on tap from time to time, but never ordered it. I guess I thought since it's so widely available, it wouldn't stack up to some of the other Trappists in comparison. Today's tasting has proven me wrong, and I'll definitely be drinking Chimay again in the near future."
"Drinkability: This is a BIG BEER! 9% ABV. It was all I could do to finish the bottle.... best bet....share with a friend. I will buy this again and let it cellar to see the difference."
"M&D - as stated, very dangerous, smooth and light bodied, and kind of fizzy, it seems to have lost some body over time, but the flavors have remained, what an amazing beer and aging has been good to it thanks again to mushroomcloud"
"What a great beer. It's so well balanced and simply tastes wonderful. It pours as a lovely color and an excellent head and has a wonderful, fruity nose. The taste is superb. I don't care for the red or the white but this is a trappist that I will always enjoy."
"This is quite an exceptional beer. I typically pass this beer up at the liquor store since I heard it was a pedestrian beer. After reading raving reviews for it, I had it for the 1st time last night. This beer is exception in all aspects except for its smell. I wasn't too impressed with the aroma. The taste is very clean and refined. This may be one of the few 9.0% ABV beers that can act as a session beer."
"750 ml bottle into a pint glass. Pours an amber brown color with two fingers of big bubbled head that dissolves oddly fast. Second pour goes better, a solid improvement shows that first look was just a bad pour. Nose is molasses and spices. Smells good, but fairly mild. Taste, on the other hand, comes out of nowhere and kicks you square in the nuts. A touch of alcohol up front. Prunes and raisins. Chocolate and some light caramel. The only hit to the flavor is that the alcohol keeps sticking its nose in throughout. Body is medium and highly carbonated. A good beer - one that actually. However, second pour went better and all in all, an excellent one from Chimay."
"Perfect for a celebration!"
"What a great beer. I will definitely try the other offerings from Chimay. Keep up the great work."
"The taste is very rich. It is full of complex fruit flavors, yeast and spiciness. Goes down very easily given the high alcohol content. Threre's a nice mouthfeel and chewiness here. Almost a meal in and of itself. It wouldn't be a dessert, because this is too complex and not sweet enough. This would be a main course and a fancy one at that."
"Wow, this beer really ages well. I would recommend setting a bottle of this aside for a year or two the next time you buy some. The fresher Chimay is good, but the older stuff is better. You can't make a bad decision with this brew."
"Not the most exciting Belgian Strong Dark Ale out there but worthy of being in the rotation. Nice for a Belgian beer beginner."
"The greatest of all time, period."
"The color was dark copper brown as it poured into the glass and dark, hazy reddish brown in the glass with a giant bubbly tan head. Smell was a bit weak, but malty and sweetly fruity. The flavor was very rich and the mouthfeel fairly thick (not quite creamy because of the sharp carbonation). The complex malt and fruit flavors are just what I expect from this Belgian style. Despite the 9% ABV, the aroma and taste are both less alocoholic than Chimay's red and white beers. In my opinion and for my tastes, this is Chimay's best brew. It is quite drinkable, too."
"D-This is dangerous to me and qualifies as a session for me. The price deters too much imbibing."
"D: Tasty, goes down very easily, not very filling, excellent kick, very good representation of style, after drinking just the 330ml bottle, I'm regretting not buying the 750ml bottle. This is definitely a good beer to drink for a whole evening."
"Oddly enough, this is the first time I've ever had the Grand Reserve (I first had the Premiere about 11 years ago). While this is a good one, there are better, and much cheaper ones to be had."
"Really great beer, but I still prefer the dubbel Chimay Premiere."
"Overall: This is a very good Belgain dark ale, although it is not as good as Rochefort 8 in my opinion. As good as it is, it seems to lack depth and intensity."
"The beer has a slightly sturdy mouth with a nice dry finish. This beer is complex and very easy drinking. Well done!!"
"So Im left to explain why so many think so much of this beer while Im the odd-duck whos unimpressed. And my hypothesis is this - that many folks (me among them) try this beer when first expanding their beer horizons, are wildly impressed by the difference, but havent yet revisited (as Im now doing) to compare against the craft/import beer adventures theyve had since breaking out with Chimay Blue. Sound plausible?"
"D: This particular vintage is a bit young at present, but it's still quite unique and very enjoyable as it is. A year or more of cellaring will only improve it greatly."
"This is an amazing beer. It was the first of the Belgians I had tasted and it is still my favorite. I have drank all of what Chimay has to offer and I have never had any one that I thought was bad! A slight bitterness that first hits the palate, then diminishes into a malty hops flavor! Thick head that is medium lasting as all chimay's are. Bottom Line I loved just like the rest of them!"
"A solid strong dark ale. Tasty, but even with a little age it still seems immature and slightly underdeveloped. Chimay's stuff is always just... ok..."
"Poured this Belgian strong dark into my Chimay goblet. Appropriate enough, heh? This corked and caged 1.9 oz bottle with the blue label was cork-dated 2006. The label lacked any information as to exactly when it was brewed which might have something to do with the average experience I had with this beer. Upon pouring, I noted an active head, lots of carbonation and thus bubbles, yet the head disapaited very quickly. A bit of a disappointment. Nonetheless, some lace did web the glass and I moved on to the nose which was...modest to barely noticeable. Some whispers of aged fruit (maybe) but really nothing else. This of course had a lot to do with the taste which was very subtle. Notes of aged prunes and raisens but not much else. Sure, some candied sugar caught my attention but what a ho-hum taste. Mouthfeel was as uneventful as the aroma and taste. Watery comes to mind. No viscous blanket to the tongue. Nada. It's drinkable I suppose, but I don't think this is a beer I will seek out again. Maybe it was a maturity thing. Maybe not. A snooze fest that I will not purchase a ticket for again anytime soon."
"Murky, nearly opaque brown body with a half an inch of light tan head. Fruit and caramel dominate the aroma with hints of spice, though the smell is not as strong as expected. Flavor has a fruity character to it, sweet, similar to apple, with spices and alcohol playing minor roles as well (the alcohol is almost non-existant). Mouthfeel is on the lighter side of medium bodied, a bit lighter than I thought it'd be. Extremely drinkable for the complexity, richness and abv of this brew. Not my favorite, but definitely one of the better brews from Belgium I have had."
"This is a very punchy ale, stronger than the other Chimay offerings I have tried. Heavy malt and cream characteristics, well-balanced by the bitterness that cleans up afterward. Coffee and a little bit of bitter chocolate plays around about halfway through the draught. I taste a little bit of dry, red wine sweetness. The aroma is toasted malt and coffee, with a little warm sugar on top. I am really enjoying this beer. But as a newcomer to the world of gourmet beer, it might be a little wasted on me. I will definitely buy more the next chance I get. I recommend this beer be enjoyed in the evening as the sun and temperature are dropping."
"A great Belgian ale in all ways."
"Most quality and enjoyable of the ""Chimay's"". However all are excellent in their own right."
"Appearance is a hazy, dark brown with a one-finger tan head. The head subsides a bit but some lasts throughout. The smell is a rich combination of malt and candy sweetness. The taste is excellent. It is a delicious mix of malt, dark fruit (mainly figs) and a little sweetness. The aftertaste is dry but lingers a bit. The mouthfeel is medium to full bodied with some tingly carbonation. Drinkability is very good. The alcohol is well hidden in the taste but the effect adds up so this limits the amount. Overall, an excellent dark Belgian that I'll certainly have again."
" D - Superior, smooth and restrained for strength contained. Subtle, expressive and effervescent x 2."
"I purchased this at a local beer store but have had this on draft in Belgium as well. There is nothing like drinking this beer at a cafe on the canals of Gent or Bruges."
"This 11oz bottle was served to me with a frosted wine glass (maybe this place shouldn't be serving Chimay). It poured a more solid root beer brown with a pretty mediocre head even with an aggressive pour, that didn't stay around long. The taste did have some sweetness, fruit, and went down very easy. Alcohol was not detectable. There was really no aftertaste present and the mouthfeel was a very sturdy medium and smooth. Drinkability is so good because the alcohol is hidden and the mouthfeel is great."
"I wish I could be more descriptive, but ""nearly flawless beer"" is about as good of a summary as I can give."
"Drinkability- Well, due to the 9% ABV youre probably not going to drink more than a couple, but a treat none-the-less. This beer, honestly, is not what I expected, but was such a treat. Really enjoyed this."
"Kind of flat and syrupy in the feel. Not impressed with this one, overpriced for sure."
"This beer poured well and had a nice brown color.While I enjoyed the yeasty aroma, it didn't seem that strong to me. The aroma didn't seem to carry much else, however I have recently quit smoking, and am only just getting some of my smell back. The taste was even, with a yeasty flavor predominate and a fruity flavor that seemed to be skirting the edge of the taste. There is that aftertaste I have noticed with Strong Belgian Ales, the sweet alcohol taste that will sometimes linger on your tongue briefly. I did enjoy the mouthfeel. It is a very carbonated beer with a lot of bubbles that play over your tongue. This is a solid Strong Ale with good characteristics. However, after trying it, I would be more likely to try something I haven't had yet. The flip side of the coin is that if I were offered this beer, I wouldn't turn it down."
"Drank this from the 11.2 oz bottle with the blue label. Pours a hazy cola color - dark reddish-brown. Tall tan head that dissipated pretty quickly. Smells of toasted grains, cola, dark cherries, yeast, touch of alcohol. Flavors are much the same - nice complexity of dark fruit, alcohol, toast, cola. Sharp bite on the touch from high carbonation and the alcohol. A very drinkable beer - I had to take it in in sips, but it was very enjoyable, especially as it went from cooler temperature to room temp."
"D: A wonderful Belgian, a classic for a reason. This will likely always be in my cellar."
"Poured a dark murky brown color with a thick tan head that took its time to dissipate. The smell is of Belgian yeast and candi sugar, not as strong as the tripel but very nice. No noticable fruity smells that are associated with BSDAs. The taste is similar to the smell, Belgian yeast & candi sugar, hints of figs and prunes towards the end. This tastes like a dark tripel. Well bodied and carbonated, a bit silky. Not as fruity or malty as some other BSDAs but has a wonderful taste and is easy drinking as the alcohol is well hidden."
"D: Good."
"First tried this wonderful beer when i began working at a Belgian bar. Loved it and from then on became pretty much obsessed with Belgian beers especially the Trappists. Highly recommend getting your hands on a magnum of the blue and laying it down for 5-10 years, worth it if you can wait that long!"
"Poured out into a snifter, some how I remember this ale having a stronger aroma to it, but it is not disappointing, it has a good sweet smell to it that reminds me of smashed grapes and it does have a slight hint of a dry alcohol. It has a very fluffy tan head thats about two inches tall and doesnt fade away too quickly, it has some good lacing and its body is a dark amber color that offers you some good eye candy. It has a clean sharp taste that has a sweet bite that to it and is followed up by a slightly dry, dull aftertaste that seems to be lacking some flavor; it just seems flat or stale."
"Very good representation of the style. I do, however, think it's better from the corked 750 ml bottle. A classic Belgian ale that everyone should try. But if I'm going to play in that league, I still prefer a St. Bernardus 12 or a Gulden Draak."
"Truly a world-class beer. If I was to pick apart anything, it would be that I would enjoy even more spices on the palate and also the carbonation has a bit too much of a bite unless you sip it very slowly (which is where I noticed more of the silky mouthfeel thing going on)."
"Chimay Grand Réserve pours a deep red brown with a thick head. I don't know if its a function of the oversized Goblet that I poured it into or the beer itself, but it maintains a perfect quarter of an inch head. Aroma is much like the red to me, ripe fruits, chalky yeast and damp hops. There is almost a vinous smell to it. Flavor is dry maltiness, with a lot of dark fruit and caramel. There is a slight sour yeast flavor that melds with the hops quite well. The alcohol is apparent, almost too much so."
"Drinkability - With the exception of the over-carbonation, this stuff is pretty decent."
"This was nice for a treat, but the price will always keep as just that."
"Definately worth trying, especially for a special occasion. Would also make a great gift!"
"D - Patently drinkable. A pleasure to drink....too easy to devour that 750. I find myself telling myself to slow down!"
"I poured this last night from a 355 ml bottle into a large mouth wine glass (my Chimay glass unfortunately broke last week). The head foams up nicely but dissipates rather quickly and therefore little head retention. I tried to place the aroma which was very subtle. The best description I could come up with was a little fusel mixed with some banana. The taste itself was subtle although I definitely notices a caramel flavor which was quite nice and the mouthfeel was velvety which contrasted exceptionally well. I came away with a revelation that this style is not my favorite but I would try it again."
"But there's no doubting the care in the making of this beer. If you like the style, especially if you relish the dryness here, you could drink this forever despite the high alcohol."
"drinkability is good. well balanced and very enjoyable. gets even better as it warms. would like to try this one with a few years of aging."
"Drinkability: the 9% alcohol is going to make it hard to drink a ton of this. The alcoholic character of this beer is there, finishing the 750 mL bottle will be doable, but Im not sure where it will put me. I would probably buy it again to try with food."
"Overall - Just a pleasure to consume. Very well balanced malt/bitter, finished super clean with a nice residual citrus hop and light malt on the palate. Dangerous from an ABV standpoint given that the alcohol is perfectly hidden. Could probably drink way to many of these given the chance."
"Apparently has lost some of its character in recent years, if so it must really have been something in the past. Perhaps a tasting of a recent and aged beer in the Kulminator in Antwerp would be a good test..."
"This feels a bit powdery at first and finishes warm."
"Poured a deep chestnut brown with a huge head. Slowly faded but never completely leaving a nice lace. Smell was very spicy, nutmeg, cinnamon, fruiteness predominated. Very light smell. The taste was very lively, dancing around in your mouth. Figs, prunes, fruitness predominated the flavor, slight alcohol finish. Big carbonation on this one. This was a long time coming for me, and well worth the wait, loved every second of it and highly recommend."
"The appearance, smell, and taste are almost too complex to describe. There are mutitudes of flavor and aromas that will probably vary from year to year as far as the dominant flavors. The head retention was perfect like the other Chimay's I sampled. The drinkability is excellent, but self restraint must be exercised due to the 9% kick. I give this beer my highest recommedation."
"Drinkability: I love this beer. I love the whole Chimay series. One of my first Belgians, many years ago and a classic example."
"A bit abrasive at first due to the zealous carbonation, however as it calms down it reaches a fine state of balance and the full flavor complexity comes throughrather than just carbonation. I did not perceive much sweetness in here, with the biscuit taking the lead much to my approval. A great beera bit pricey, but knowing that the proceeds go to charity and other monkish activities helps lessen the blow, along with the great ale of course!"
"Definately not a session beer. I would easily have a few glasses of this however."
"Easily the best in the Chimay range, as widely accepted, and rightly so. A premium Belgian export, if ever there were one."
"A: Incredible. A night-sipper, and it's amazing how subtle it is for a 9% ale. This is one of the best Belgians IMO, and is a gift from the heavens. This alone would justify a flight to Belgium."
"Everything about this beer is good. Smell, taste, creamy mouthfeel...it's all there. My gripe is that this beer is just a tad too conservative and subdued to really work for me. The smell is good but muted. The taste is interesting but lacks pop. I find La Terrible (powerful hops) or Rochefort Trappistes 8 (more complex, bold taste) to be better beers. Understand, I would never turn this beer down if it was offered. It's really good. It's just not what I'm personally looking for in a Belgian Strong Dark Ale."
"The beer is sweet, but thankfully the sweetness is very enjoyably rounded out by a rich malty flavor and mellow aftertaste. a little bitterness hits the tongue at first, and fades away as the sweetness slides in. really nice, and very smooth. 9.0% has never been this easy."
"Drinkability - The only thing to keep this one away from a ""sessionable"" ale, is the ABV. Very strong - Very Delicious."
"D: Very drinkable. I love this beer. I know it's a little mainstream and I can even find it at my local Heath Food store but I still love it. Simple as that."
"I don't think I'd want more than one of these (not that I'd turn down a free one). I pretty much just tried it because I was like ""You know, it's weird that I've never tried Chimay."" Now I have, and well... whatever. It's indeed very good, but not worth its hype, and CERTAINLY not worth its price. If you haven't tried it, try it just so you can say you have."
"An exceptionally drinkable beer for the style and for the ABV. Still, I find several of the Unibroue offerings to be more drinkable although not necessarily better overall."
"Drinkability: It's still a good brew, but it doesn't wow me the way it once did. This one doesn't deserve the anti-Chimay sentiment that's prevalent among BAs (Red and White probably do). It's nice to revisit an old friend."
"D: I am glad I got a lot of this stuff from my recent trip to Belgium. I will need to go back soon and get more. This is something I would always have in the 'fridge if I lived in Belgium."
"Pours a very dark mahogony with a large tan foamy head. The head lasts awhile and leaves good lacing. The smell isn't as strong as a hoped,but there was candy sugar,roasted malt,and alcohol. The taste has a ton of carbonation with dark fruit,raisins and cherries,candy sugar,alcohol,and a nice dry finish. The m/f is medium with all the complex flavors mixing well. What can I say that hasn't been said? This is a world class beer that must be tried."
"The taste is certainly fruity up front, with some of that patented Belgian spice flavor, as well. There is a warming alcohol finish to this nice, balanced and complex brew. Mouthfeel is medium and creamy. Very drinkable, this Chimay lives up to its reputation."
"Good beer that I will get in the future. Definately want 750's from now on since the baby bottle is too small."
"Drinkability: At 9%, I'd be tempted to knock this thing down, but I have to admit this is one of the few beers I can drink until I can drink no longer. Something about the complex flavors and the fact that it's not too overwhelming...highly, highly drinkable."
"Brown cloudy beer, with a very foamy head that doesn't take long to disappear. Aroma: Yeast, port wine, chocolate, some pepper and vanilla and slightly lactic. Strong body, it weights in your tongue.Taste: sweet, but with the usual harshness, floral, rum, liquor, chocolate, plums or raisins. Another great beer from Chimay, better if you keep it stored for some years before drinking it."
"The taste gets a surprisingly subtle, yet complex mix of flavors with a big chestnut and malt bit up front that transitions to a smooth raisiny, citris, and wheat aftertaste. More raisin and plum notes come through as it warms. The feel is of a well-balanced, well-carbonated ale that pleases the palate. A bit dry, but not to the point of losing its appeal. Definately drinkable, with enough here to keep interest through a few beers (if the wallet could take it). Goes well with swiss or brie."
"It doesn't get much better than this. It pours a nice dark translucent brown with a thick off-white head that retains nicely and finishes with some good lacing. The aroma is rich with fruit and the alcohol is not to be missed. This is rich and smooth, with a nice malty sweetness and fruit flavors. Good alcohol kick and light hoppiness as well. It's very full-bodied, with light carbonation. It's actually a bit warming to drink. Very drinkable, despite it's potent ABV. This is a perfect companion to a nice holiday meal!"
"Drinkability: I'm positive this will not be my last Chimay Blue, especially since it is getting served in more restaurants locally."
"D - This is a beer that is meant for sipping but with that in mind it is easily a drinkable beer. The alcohol will settle in time and make this beer more drinkable as it ages."
"D - I'm not a huge fan of Belgians, but this is probably the most drinkable one I've had yet. It is a very well-balanced beer and not as alcoholic as I thought it would be, given the ABV%."
"i can see why many consider this a crossover beer, as it is an easily accesible and aquirable belgian... but it just has too little complexity for me for the style and lacks the elan necessary to bring me back for a return visit..."
"Mouthfeel was medium bodied with a zesty pleasant burn of alcohol and carbonation. A very drinkable beer."
"A nice cloudy dark brown/chocolate color, poured easily it generated a nice head, with dissapated rather quickly. The first smell has raisins on the nose. The beer on the tongue is very rich with almost a creamy quality, though far too carbonated in retrospect. The beer is very drinkable, to it's disadvantage, as my glass ran empty too quickly. I'd buy it agian, but I would need to try to pair it with a meat dish."
"Sure its a little weaker, but this tastes just like a Quad to me, Three Philosophers especially, but without the cherry lambic. Got a bottle with dinner at La Cena in Fayetteville (just outside Syracuse), The sweetness of the beer went great with the lamb and sweet potatoes. Smells of raisins and dry dates. Tasted more tart and bitter with some cherry, white grape, and brown sugar. Very drinkable, just make sure you don't serve it too cold. This beer comes alive at cellar temp."
"Much too drinkable ..I 'll buy more .and spend a lot of time trying to homebrew a reasonable substitute ...."
"Overall: This is definitely one that improves with age. I think that it might be worth it to buy a case of Chimay every year just to cellar."
"D - I really enjoy drinking this ale and would like to sit around for hours drinking these and pondering life's meaning. Perhaps I should become a Trappist Monk after all."
"I've had better bottles of this before but this was still respectable. A little aging and some warmer serving temperatures would have served this beer well but I unfortunately didn't have time to sit on my lunch break and let this bad boy breath for a while. Shame on the bar for not properly serving the brew but props for having it at all."
"This dark belgian is absolutely phenomenal! Pours a rocky head with great lacing. Is an opaque black color and a great winter brew. Downside to this beer, although one of the top Belgians in the world, is way overpriced. You can get a Duvel for half the price. But, it has fruity esthers, cherries, cocoa, some orange peel and plum. Awesome brew, wish the price would come down to reality, as it is $5.00 for an 11.2 Oz beer."
"Just a superb sipper for any time  a real winter warmer if you desire. The 9% is well hide behind the loaded malts. Id luv to make this a normal drinker, the $10 bomber price is a bummer, esp. when you could buy this in Belgium for a couple bucks."
"D - Highly drinkable. I flat out love this beer. My wife and I have been known, (on rare occasions) to polish off three 750's of the delicious beer. As I mentioned above, it's always in the house."
"This is a nice beer. easy to drink"
"Poured into a brandy snifter, with a nice release of carbonation and a relatively short lived milk chocolate head. A nice swirl of the glass releases a great casky/blunt tart smell. The mouthfeel is nice with a great intensity of flavors and smells, with a substantial burst on the tounge of carbonation. A very nice drinkable Belgium dark ale! Always one of my favorites."
"This is one brew I wish was more readily available as it is excellent one. looking forward to more of this in the near future while it is available."
"Served in a Chimay chalice; nice chestnut color with an off-white head that leaves a little lace. Fruity aroma. Taste seems to open up as the beer warms. Somewhat raisin-y, with a very strong malt presence. Alcohol taste is quite well masked. Very drinkable; not my favorite Belgian, but maybe my favorite Chimay."
"I have sampled several other of the Chimay beers and this one is surely the best. It has a hefty price tag but is worth the buck."
"D - Much, much better than I remember from the last time I had this. I'll chalk it up to experience. Certainly the best of the Chimay's i've had."
"If my memory is correct, the beer in this bottle was more mellow than the rest of the case that was consumed within a year or two of purchase in the mid 1990s. It was still a superior beer to savor after 11 years."
"Drinkability - this is good, not great. High abv limits sessionability. Enjoy with food."
"D- very drinkable for such a strong ale, a great trappist ale, enjoyed it very much, could probly end up drinking a few of these in a night"
"The taste -- ohh, the taste. This is where it rises up. VEry rarely do I give a beer a 5 in any category, but this gets it done. It's really everything you expect. Heaps of sweet maltyness with overtones of fruits. Not too sweet, not too bitter. Balanced really well, with none of the medicinal aftertaste that sits on the back of your palate after swallowing Chimay white. It's just a damn fine taste with no flaws. Mouthfeel is good, but not fantastic. I actually prefer te smoothy creamyness of the Red to the Blue. Drinkability is well above average. The taste keeps your tongue happy."
"Chimay Grand Reserve was a hazy dark orange-brown color with an off-white head. The head was large to start with but soon only a thin layer remained. The aroma was malt with some dried fruit and a hint of alcohol. The taste was malty, fruity, a little peppery, and somewhat alcoholic with a dry, warming finish. The body was about medium with fairly high carbonation. Drinkability was good. Overall it is a good beer that I will purchace again. This beer definately improves as it warms."
"The score may be a little low as I found myself comparing this to other Belgians rather than to the rest of the beer world. Defnitely a high quality Trappist but there are others I enjoy more."
"This is a perfect beer to share with a friend on a special occasion."
"This beer has a dark brown color which matches perfectly with the slightly sweet flavor of the dark malt (subtle chocolate flavor). There is a faint yeast flavor, which is just enough so that it doesn't take away from the flavor. It has an incredibly smooth feel, and is almost dangerously drinkable. It is 9% ABV, but the alcohol, while noticeable, does not overpower the flavor of the malt. For such a dark, malty beer, it does not even feel too heavy. This is a truly amazing beer."
"D: Enjoyed this beer thoroughly, and would order a second round, keeping in mind the abv, of course. Still, for a taste this complex, its a real treat that beckons to be enjoyed again."
"This beer was extreemly smooth. Served and the proper temp it just goes down with the most amazing flavor! I highly recommend this beer! I was able to find this beer in a 1.94 pint bottle at my local Harris Teeter which made this taste test very convient. I would have to say at this point, it may be my favorite beer ever!"
"D- Very."
"Excellent beer. I had this beer with a Kobe steak, and the steak lost out. From the first pour to the last drink, no disapointment. Most impressive was the creamy mouthfeel and matching taste. Chocolate, fruity, just to name a few. My glass made it's way around the table (wine snobs), and I was lucky to get it back! A must try."
"Pours a dark chocolatey brown with about an inch of creamy tan head that fades away to leave a thin film. Smells floral and citrusy and malty and faintly of alcohol. A very pleasant aroma. And damn that's good flavor. Tastes very malty with some orange notes. Slight alcohol vapor on the backend, but it is 9% so that's to be expected. Very enjoyable flavor. The mouthfeel is very pleasant as well, it actually seems to foam up when it hits my tongue and create a very thick full mouthfeel. All in all, an excellent beer, I will be getting this whenever I can afford/find it."
"I have been waiting to drink this beer in order to get a few more beers under my wing experience wise. I poured this 11.9 ounce bottle into a glass beer mug. I has a HUGE head, a pleasing dark amber with slight lacing. I found the smell a bit lacking, I was a little stuffed up but very little by way of smell especially considering this beer fantastic taste. Sweet, creamy, hoppy, with a slight bitterness to chase. The mouthfeel is amazing, the carbonation really envelops the pallate. Overall an amazing beer with a nice alcohol kick."
"Drinkability/Notes: What a really nice Belgian Dark Ale. Malty sweet with a fruitiness that reminds one of fresh raisin bread. Hops make a subtle appearance in the finish which lends it a very slight bitterness to offset some of that malty goodness. Alcohol. What alcohol? Extremely well hidden for 9% abv, though a warmness does touch the face. Very flavorful, one I wouldn't get tired of drinking though the 9% abv would definitely make itself known. Overall, a delicious Belgian Dark Ale. Highly recommended and one I can't wait to have again. Seek and enjoy."
"Tastes as it smells, not as hoppy as I expected. A lovely citrus, candy malt. The alcohol is masked very well. Mouthfeel and drinkability are superb. A warm, bubbly delight. Aftertaste is mild, inviting the next sip. A very well rounded ale."
"D - It's not something I'd drink every day, or a lot of at a time, but it's something I'd drink regularly over a long time span."
"Drinkability is comparable to other trappist ales. Something to savor, but not an everyday beer."
"The sourness of the after-palate is a bit offsetting at first, but blends quickly until it is the taste you anticipate with your next sip."
"Like a lot of others, I really looked forward to trying this beer. The appearance was a very nice brown with a lace head. The smell was inviting but the taste was too much like wine for me. The alcohol is very strong in the taste. For these reasons, it is not very drinkable beer for me."
"Having just tried the Chimay Red, this has a far better mouthfeel and length."
"Chimay's best beer by far. Pours a dark amber with a solid head. great smell and taste, a rich beligum ale, really fulls your whole mouth. Has a great aftertaste and keeps you wanting more, could def drink it all night. I had it a few times at a sushi restaurant and it goes great with sushi i think."
"This is by far one of the finest brews I've had the pleasure of tasting. Pretty much spoils you for anything else. Only drawback to drinkability is the alcohol content, not that you can taste it. No bitterness, all in all the best Belgian I've tried yet. Smooth and delicious. Next case will be big bottles."
"Pours a dark brown body with a greyish head that disipated rather quickly and left the signature Belgian style lacing. The beer was very loud it can be heard cracking and popping with out having your ear right next to it. The taste and aroma followed each other. It was a very raisiny sweetness with other dried fruit notes. The mouthfeel was extremely dry and bubbly with carbonation popping on the tounge. This was a slow sipping beer that must be handled with respect."
"Drinkability: I don't think I would personally want an entire 750ml again, but it wasn't a problem to finish. It's scary how some can really handle this beer, my friend drinks two 750mls in a sitting, I'm not sure why or even if that is respectful to the beer but its obvious he loves, more than I."
"Drinkability: It is simply wrong for a beer this complex to be disappearing from my glass so quickly."
"D-I finished this quickly, while eating a BBQ/Cheddar pizza w/ smoked sausage. Despite it being an individual size pizza, I still had half of it left when I finished the beer. I'm already feeling a bit lightheaded. Although I finished this really quickly, I could probably only drink one (BELCH!!), make that 2 more of these, which I say is pretty good, considering the style, ABV."
"Though not as favorible as some of the bolder Belgian Strong Darks out there, I do indeed like this one."
"Cheers!"
"D-700 ml Bottle wasnt enough! I wanted more,I could drink a few bottles of this.This is one fine ale!. Recommended!"
"D: Can't talk about this like it's a session beer, so any drinkability comment has to revolve around my willingness to drink it. It looks good, tastes great, and exists as a very complex, interesting beer. It's very enjoyable, but I'm sure that if you had more than a 750mL to yourself, the strength and sweetness of this beer might overwhelm you. I'd recommend it in moderation, so that you can enjoy it more. That said, it's always drinkable."
"A strong anise flavor hits the tastebuds first, followed by a light milk chocalate-soaked raisin flavor that lingers a good while. All spice elements noted in the aroma above come through in the mouth, subtle but clear. A creamy, milky mouthfeel takes the flavors to another level, and I just can't say enough good things about this one. Certainly nothing bad. Even the high 9% alcohol is incorporated well enough that you only notice it in context of everything else that's going on. Superb, superb, superb."
"Solid but disappointing in respect to the expectations I held for a Grande Reserve. In fact, I wonder what the conditioning of this bottle has been. Perhaps it is just too young and needs more time in the bottle. Perhaps I need to try it again."
"Drinkability: Easy to drink, one of my favs....but price in the bars..."
"Poured a reddish amber color with a HUGE off white head. Fruity, malty, slightly sweet aroma and I still can't get over this head. Smooth spicy taste with slight alcohol presense as the brew warms up. Back a few months ago, this was my introduction to Trappists, and I was not disappointed! I drank a 2000 vintage magnum the other night and just wanted to note how awesome it tasted. Still I thought the aroma was alittle weak, but once it hits your mouth it is amazing."
"Overall, this is a extremely high-quality trappist brew. Of all the trappist brews, this is definitely my favorite. It has such a nice rounded flavor, perfect mouthfeel, and wonderful smell. This is a must have brew, folks!"
"A very complex and inviting beer which pulls you in then gives you a kick. A good choice for any celebration (except maybe your friends release from AA)."
"When opening the bottle, I damn near punched a hole in the wall with the cork. Beer pours a hazy brown color with a big ass fluffy off white head. Way over carbonated. The aroma smells like a Bud after just poppin a can open. Flavor isnt much better. Light malt sweetness with some background esters. The bitterness seems to linger. Medium body. Slight alcohol warming. Very disappointed with this beer. Hope the wife will drink the rest."
"From the 750ml bottle. Pours a gorgeous brownish black with a dense head of tiny bubbles that sits for quite a while, fed by a steady stream of ""me too""s running up the sides of the chalice. The smell is lovely, the spice from the oh-so-recognizable yeast mixing with notes of raisin and chocolate. The taste is yeast up front, spicy on the tip of the tongue, then melting to a nutela-like mix and a warming alcohol finish. Mouthfeel is very good, slippery on the tongue and maybe just a whisker thin to support the strong malty/yeasty flavors. The carbonation is excellent and balances the dark character of the beer nicely. The drinkability is excellent. It goes down very easily for a 9 percenter. The brothers definitely got some divine intervention on this one."
"Poured into a snifter, pretyt impressive dark brown with a nice fluffy carmel head that leaves some lacing on the glass. Smell is of fresh ripe fruits apples with a hint of maltiness and some fresh bread. Taste is very complex tastes like warm apple cider with hints of roasted goodness maybe with some nice yeast touches in there. This was a very good drink the alcohol was very masked and this drink went down very smooth, it stated on the bottle to let it warm up a bit, but I finished it to quickly because of the smoothness of this, I guess next one I drink I will let it warm up a bit to see if another flavor comes out of it. Two thumbs up."
"I didn't have a true chalice style glass to use to drink this, so substituted large wine glasses instead, and they worked out pretty well. This pours a deep brown color and there is a lot of evervescence noticeable the entire time. The aroma is fantastic and somewhat hoppier then I expected from a Belgian ale. This beer drinks more like a wine then a beer, and I think should be sipped and savored slowly to truly appreciate it. Very complex flavors, some malty sweetness, a little sourness, and more then a hint of hops present. What I thought was particularly interesting was if you take a good sized sip and hold it in your mouth for a few seconds, you can feel the carbonation on your tongue. Almost reminiscent of the effect Pop-Rocks or champagne would have. Fantastic beer, but I find it a little pricey to drink on anything other then a special occassion."
"Pours a lovely dark reddish brown hue into a challis. I love the head, its very creamy and stays with the beer until the finish. Smells and tastes are of nuts like walnut and pecan, roasted barely, coffee, chocolate, and caramel. I love the mouthfeel of this beer. Drinkability is very good, I could easily have more than my share of this if I am not careful. From the moment you take your first sip and it laps over your tongue until you swallow it is sheer jubilance!"
"Overall- A beer that has potential. The flavor is almost there and the alcohol is too high! If these 2 could be better regulated this would be phenominal!"
"This poured a dark cloudy brown with a very thick persistent head. The smell is floral and a bit hoppy. The taste is well balanced between malt and hops with a floral hint. The aftertaste is a bit sweet. The mouthfeel is medium bodied but unexpectedly light for the color. The carbonation adds just a little zing to this brew. Id consider this one a delight to have whenever possible."
"Drinkability: A solid Belgian ale - very smooth, very mellow, and very drinkable."
"Drinkability - May not have more than 1 of these in a day, but definitly will look to have this again. A great after-dinner beer."
"Beautiful deep brown coloration with a good inch of light brown head fading fast to little clusters and circles of carbonation, but very, very inviting. Has a nice malty, bready nose on the subtle side with some vinegar/olive traces. Taste is vinegar up front, turning malty after the first swallow, carbonation is brought by the third and a nice balance arrived at in the fourth. Alcohol of course is detected in the aftertaste, and a bit of bitter hops on the back end. Some wine like qualities as in other dark Belgians. Chimay is right up there with the best of them."
"Still very drinkable, but certainly past it's peak. Overall, it was a very enjoyable experience to get a chance to taste this vintage brew."
"Drinkability/Overall: very high for the abv, this is a lesson in understated, refined complexity and balance. Very nice."
"I would recommend this beer with a meal where some strength can be used to prepare the palate for each bite, i.e., not a spicy dish. Perhaps turkey with sweet potatoes would be an ideal accompaniment, ideal for thanksgiving, perhaps. I don't think this goes well with salty foods, unlike many other beers."
"Overall, its a good beer."
"This is easily one that could be aged and I wouldn't mind doing so to see how the flavors change over time. Chimay Blue is a sipper... one to sit back with and enjoy. A nice comptemplative, relaxing ale."
"all thing said, this is a very good beer."
"A very nice beer for sipping. Heavy and luscious, as expected. Will have to try this again when the the weather gets cold."
"In conclusion, I enjoyed this beer, and it is definitely a classic rappist Ale. I might drink another on a cold winters night (instead of todays 90+ dgree weather). But at only 9% abv, the alcohol was a little too noticeable in taste and smell, as I felt more like I was drinking shots of whiskey."
"Overall, this is an amazing beer that should be had by all [though some won't like the style]. Certainly, for the style it is a classic. Very distinct. Only downside is that I can't have too many at a sitting as the strong flavors and sweetness get to me [as does the high alcohol content]. Nice digestive."
"D - Somewhat disappointing given its reputation, with several others within the style being superior brews. Worth trying though."
"for it. You will be impressed!"
"This has been one of my favorite beers for a long time, so I finally had to review it here. The aroma is quite possibly the best thing here -- so complex and well balanced. Tastes and looks great as well. If you haven't tried it yet, you should! Spoil yourself with a bottle of this... one of those beers that I always look forward to having. Trappist monks may give up their earthly pleasures, but I'd say this one is rather godly!"
"Drinkability: too boozy to be highly drinkable. I really wanted to love this one, but I just like it. Didn't live up to my expectations, at least."
"Widely distributed, this beer is an excellent Belgian representative. The complexities and flavor really come out with cellaring."
"Cheers."
"Overall - This is a spectacular beer, and well worth the hype that surrounds it. Nothing else needs to be said. This is absoultely one of the best beers I have had."
"Drinkabitly is great , a very smooth beer for 9%. I may need to age more of this."
"Overall, this is a very drinkable beer. I like the balance of malt and hops. The alcohol is pleasant and not overpowering. I could imagine this beer would balance out a little more as it ages."
"I'll pass on the review. At this point odes have been written regarding the taste and smell. Enjoy if you can!"
"750 ml bottle pours out a Brown/Maroon color with a huge tan, foamy head. It smelled of mild hops, fruit and there were some floral notes, also. There was a strong malt flavor with hints of spice and caramel. It has a slightly bitter aftertaste. Initially it has a very sharp mouthfeel, but it softens as it warms. It is very drinkable. The only knock on drinkability is the high ABV."
"33 cL bottle, chilled to just below cellar temperature, poured into a silver-rimmed Chimay chalice. A careful pour yields a deep ruddy brown with a skimming of grey-yellow foam. Yeasty sour clove aromas mingle with scents of vanilla tobacco and green lettuce. Sweet caramel-dipped cherry flavors begin the sip with a cinnamon-roll doughiness at the middle. Allspice and white pepper shore up the back end right before an alcohol-bitter finish. Slick and actively carbonated peppery mouthfeel, medium-to-thin body. As it warms, the mouthfeel becomes fluffier, but not enough to make this outstanding for me. Certainly a good beer, but as far as Trappist beers are concerned, I think I'd choose any of Rochefort's offerings first."
"Overall it's something I will try more and more as it comes in fresh to get the full affect of this beer. I like it when it gets to 50 degrees or a little higher."
"D - No quarrels with this beer. Good alone and good with food. With its percentage (9%), it makes for not the best idea when trying to escape the summer heat, probably best for an evening bbq."
"Just an incredible beer!"
"A medium to heavy body with a smooth, velvety mouthfeel. This is very easy and enjoyable to drink, as a Begian of this style usually is, just beware of it's potentcy...Yeah! Wish I had bought a couple more..."
"Since I like a hop presence, I personally prefer the Cinq Cents version, but knowing the traditional flavors of Belgians, this is superior."
"Overall, a good beer, but not great. I need to try more offering in this style for comparison."
"Drinkability: This beer is delicious. If i had a bunch of these infront of me, with a good meal, at %9 ABV I would destroy myself drinking it. It's smooth and complex, my mouth doesn't get bogged down or saturated with the flavor. Potentially the ultimate session brew, except you'd be hammered."
"For the taste and the smell, I can't pin everything down in this brew. Maybe in a year or so I'll be able to indentify things. For now, at least I know it's delicious."
"Very nice sipping beer. At its best when served at the right temperature and out of a wide-rimmed glass. Only thing I would criticize is it wasn't as flavorful as expected."
"Overall: I like the version that comes in the corked bottles a little more, but this would be a good option for someone who is unsure if they'll like it or not. Definitely worth a try if you've never had it before."
"Drinkability: High, granted I can afford more."
"My first Chimay beer, quite a lovely experience. Pours a nice light brown color with a good head and retention. Aroma is sweet, malty and spicy. Complex and interesting. The taste follows with a spicy and malty flavor with a nice clean finish from the well-placed hops. Mouthfeel is nice, medium-bodied with a pleasing amount of carbonation and smoothness. This beer is quite tasty, and pretty drinkable for something with an ABV of 9.00%."
"The blue pours a very dark brown, with dark red ruby tones, with a beautiful slightly off-white foamy head. The smell is fruity, with malty features coming through. The taste is sweet, malty, fruity, with no inclination of the alcohol contained within this fine beverage. The mouthfeel is nice, having a pleasant carbonated fueled fizz hiting the palatine taste buds, and the tongue enjoys a very mild coating of sweetness. A very nice brew. I will enjoy again and again. Certainly give this a try, if you have not already done so."
"Initially I was a tad disappointed as I had very high expectations, but after consuming a few oz. and then a few more, I must say this is one fine beer."
"The thin body and the low complexity do not live up to my expectations."
" Definitely recommended, I'll be trying it again soon."
"Santé"
"D-A little pricey for an everyday drink especially if you are drinking it by yourself."
"Lately ive been trying to review a different style of beer every time I come on here. I've had this beer quite few times, and after enjoying it more every single time, I feel that it is more then worthy of a review. Pours a dark color with an eggplant color, sort of black, purple and brown all at the same time. There was a large white head at first, that soon faded into a small white one leaving no residue on the side of the glass. Smell was of dark fruits: raisins, plums, cherries, some sweet sugars also. When i smelled this one i got a bit too close and actually snorted some by accident, oh well if there was ever a beer that I actually wanted to snort i guess it would be this one. Anyway, taste was very sweet and rich, with sugar, juicy fruit, figs, molasses, honey, literally a huge spectrum of tastes going to and fro throughout this beer. Mouthfeel was also exceptional, as it was full bodied and delicious. Let this one swirl around the palate, and notice how many new tastes come through with each taste. I would love to drink these as often as i can, it is that good. This is my favorite out of the other Chimays. Next time i'm gonna have to cellar one or two of these. Cheers"
"One of my more enjoyable Belgians lately, especially versus the white Chimay. No alcohol taste present, and hint of roasted chocolate was evident. Nice and easy to enjoy, definitely worth picking up again. My non-BA friends loved it as well."
"Pours a dark caramel brown color, with some nice looking amber highlights. A decent oatmeal colored, half inch head forms. Quickly fades, leaving some very spotty lacing, not much. Refreshing green apple smell combined with spices, cloves, and a touch of alcohol. Taste pretty much mimics the smell and finishes with some hop bitterness. Leaves that nice alcohol warm feeling in the gut. Excellent mouthfeel, very smooth, very creamy and full bodied, a bit chewy. An easy brew to drink, even with the 9% abv. An absolute pleasure, let this one warm up to room temp. My first from Chimay, and a good impression was made!"
"Overall, an incredible beer, a must try."
"Bought this from the Liquor store I work in. 750ml bottle dated 10/05 poured into a widemouthed wine glass. My first impression was a fruity aroma, cherries mixed with plums. The pour left an excellent head that lingered for quite some time. The taste was a superb mix of sweet malt, blackberries and cherries with a slight hop finish. This a beer I love to drink as a special treat. I look forward to popping into the 3 bottles I have laid down in the cellar from the '03 batch."
"Lovely pour. Head is a coarse brown the fizzes away in mere minutes. No lacing. Nose is muted, but what I do smell reminds me of maple syrup and plums. Taste is sweet brown sugar, plums, coriander and a meek hop presence. Mouthfeel is lively. Honestly, I'm not too thrilled with this. Sure, it's one of my favorite styles, but there are so many other beers out there that do it better imo. Save your money and buy a Ommegang or Trois Pistoles by Unibroue instead."
"Drinkability: Without a doubt in my mind this is the Chimay brew to drink and I know I definitely will again. This is a fresh bottle (as in I haven't cellared it), so I wonder what would happen over time. Perhaps I'll have to store one away. Certainly a great example of the style; nothing flashy but excellent and balanced and delicious on all accounts."
"Poured from a corked and caged 750 ml bottle into a Duvel tulip glass, this beer had a murky reddish brown appearance with a huge frothy head. Strangely, I could not pick up much of an aroma other than a little bit of a malty, toffeeish smell. The taste was very nice however, quite malty and spicy with notes of chocolate, maple syrup, dark fruit and caramel. It also had a pleasing alcoholic warmth. This beer was full bodied and rich on the palate. Chimay blue is one of my all time favorites and I plan on cellaring a couple of bottles for a future review."
"Pours a deep dark brown color with nice thick off white head. Smell of dark fruits. Taste is very rich, nice maltyness with fruit and spice overtones. Mouthfeel is awesome, smooth. The best of the 3 Chimay offerings. Overall, just an enjoyable beer. I am now a fan of Chimay."
"from a gift pack containing the white, red and blue along with a chimay goblet glass. pours quite dark and somewhat cloudy with a white head. malty, somewhat spicy odor. taste is pretty darn good. heavy malt character. chocolatey. belgian spices on the back end. mouthfeel is full and about right for the style. good drinkability and with a fairly hard hitting alcohol punch."
"A rare treat."
"From a big ass bomber purchased in Belfast (Maine not Ireland) Pours ruby red/brown, smells of dried fruit, like apricots. Tastes the same with some hoppy characteristics and alcohol, but seems to fade out quickly. Moputhfeel is ok, but a bit thin for a Belgian like this. Overall it's pretty good and will have it again and again but it's not great."
"Mouth: Excellently strong carbonation with warm, alcoholic exhale that was strong enough to make my ears tingle. Tastes of toffee, coffee, and malt."
"So it's been a year since I tried one of these and fortunately I still had a bottle from the group that I purchased for my last review. Many of the qualities that I found in my previous tasting still exist, but overall it's a much more mellow beer. The dominant characters now seem to be a pleasing caramel and toffee malt component along with raisins and figs. The yeast has receded a bit, but there's still a fair bit of breadiness. Overall, it's quite smooth and malty - to me it's improved with a bit of aging. I've still got one more bottle from that bunch, so I'll see if I can hold on to it for another year."
"I could certainly drink many of these, had it not been for a combination of the high abv and the price."
"Overall: An excellent fruity Belgian dark, heartily recommended."
"Pretty enjoyable & drinks better than the ABV. If could only try one BE style beer this one brings a lot to the table..."
"This and the Abbaye des Rocs Gran Cru are my favorite in this style. Pours dark brown, almost black. Aroma of cherries and dark fruit. Also lots of roasted malt. It just smells rich. Taste is incredibly well balanced. I look forward to every taste as I enjoy this baby. Chimay is not as sexy as other, harder to find Belgians, but it's hard to do better than this one."
"The smell I picked up was of alcoholic esters with some figs. The taste was a fine balance between a roasty malt and more yeasty characteristics. Overall, smooth and well-balanced for a beer that's 9 per cent ABV. Taste-wise, I prefer Trois Pistoles, but this one felt better going down: less abrasive carbonation while still being every bit as warm in the belly. A classic."
" As anyone can see from the hundreds and hundreds of reviews on this site that this is a damn fine Belgian Strong Dark Ale. Try it for yourself, you won't be disappointed."
"Poured a deep , maroon/brown with aburn edges. An inch and a half of super creamy and dense , baige foam formed a inpenetrable layer on top , with walls of lacing left sliding down the chalice. Aroams of sweet and ripe dark fruits , blackberry , blueberry etc , chocolate , yeast , and alcohol are in the nose. Taste is a pleasantly complex and rich blend of dark fruits , malt , some medicinal taste , a bit of chocolate , and some warming alcohol. Mouthfeel is creamy and smooth with a dry , yeasty , and lingering aftertaste. A very tasty and rich Belgian strong dark ale. Very drinkable"
"It was an exceptional experience and can't wait to save a couple of more bottles to open in the next 5-10 years."
"This was a 750ml bottle with the date 1/06 stamped on the cork. It was a dark brown color with a very small head. It had a sweet, fruity (?raisin, ? banana) odor with a bit of spiciness. I thought the taste would be a little more complex, but it wasn't. It had a spicy, malty flavor, with some mild hop bitterness. A good beer, quite drinkable despite the 9%Abv."
"Very drinkable for a 9% brew.... I just remember this one being more memorable."
"Cheers!"
"Smooth and creamy mouthfeel, full bodied but not syrupy at all. I could definately have a couple more of these."
"D - Overall not a bad beer but for me personal preferance, will take some time to get used to."
"I think this beer would make a good session beer, except that it is just a little high in alcohol. But the flavor is great, and I can see myself having a few. Thanks David for hooking me up."
"Presented in a 750ml bottle with champagne cork and bail. With no agitation in over a week, the beer still energetically bubbled over once I popped the cork. Pours a pretty garnet-brown color with ruby highlights, topped by a creamy khaki-colored head that dissipates a bit more quickly than I would like. Aroma of slightly sweet European malt, Belgian yeast, and notes of raisin and bread, with an underlying whiff of alcohol. Palate is understated - sweet, honeyish malt blended with a touch of Euro hops. Notes of spicy yeast, raisins, plums, and very faint caramel are present. Finish is nice and warm, so as not to let you forget the alcohol content. Body is nice and creamy, but also a tad foamy. Still, right on the mark for the Trappist style. All-around, quite drinkable for such a big beer."
"Overall: The smell doesn't set you up propery for how the taste hits you in the mouth. I really love this beer. The complexity of the taste is worth trying again and again. The alcohol is very subdued and can sneak up on you."
"We were very excited to try this for the first time but once we sipped on this (very expensive) ale, it just fell short of all the hoopla. I am not saying it is not a good beer, it is actually quite refined in texture (crisp, medium body) and balancing of the high alcohol level but just lacked a full or deep flavor. Or, perhpas I should just say that it was a little too subtle for a Friday night at the bar. I suspect the mild sweetness and spiciness will pair well with rich and/or spicy food. I will give this ale another shot with some food this time and see if can identify any hidden flavors that just didn't come out last night."
"Drinkability - This is alot more drinkable than the red, not that the red isn't drinkable mind you, just that this is a little more balanced in my opinion."
"So heres my beef with Chimay Blue. If Im going to pay as much as this stuff costs, I would like a beer that I dont have to age 3 years before I drink it. Every time I drink a bottle straight from the store or at a bar, I feel like it is an underdeveloped, uncomplicated baby of a beer. Sure its loaded with dark fruits, candied sugar, and lovely Belgian yeasts. They just arent very exciting. Liekwise, the body is reasonably depthful and lightly sour but it lacks vitality. Overall, I just cant understand the hype surrounding this brew when masterpieces like Ommegang rival it so well at a fraction of the cost."
"Overall, a fine effort."
"By far my favorite Chimay offering. The Cinq Cents is good in its own right I guess, but the red label leaves you wanting something more substantial. Go for the blue any chance you get."
"Drinkability: The ale is severely limited by both the price tag ($11 for a bomber) and abv. Despite those factors, this ale is a true gem and stands well amongst the family of Trappist ales."
"I am not a big fan of the chimay beers but my 2 experiences with older versions of the red and blue have both produced notably better beers."
"I guess I answered my own question about why I reviewed this beer. Sometimes a beer is available all over the place for a good reason.. this one sure is in that category. It is all over the place and unlike my ramblings on this site ... it all comes together near perfectly."
"good mouthfeel: creamy enough for the flavor compounds to stick around but not knife-and-fork worthy"
"Beer looks nice. Deep brownish/red non transparent with a two finger head that leaves behind a small amount of lacing. Smell is of citris and melons and maybe some berries mixed in as well. Taste is fruit and malts with a little alcohol coming through as well, but not as a detriment. Mouthfeel was pretty good, but a little too carbonated for my liking. Drinkablity is very good. I wouldn't have a problem if forced to drink another. Actually, I'd very much enjoy that."
"The mouthfeel is thicker, slicker, and all-around heavier than other Chimay beers, but still stays springy. This is a great sippin beer. It makes me want to slip into a silk robe and start talkin like the ladies man."
"D  Very drinkable beer that warms you up fast. Lots of flavor and alcohol level to relax after one or two glasses. A must for trying the Belgian Trappist styles."
"In this beer the alcohol smell is great. I forgot this was 9%."
"This is my first Chimay and I like it. Maybe not super-complex, but pleasantly tasty."
""
"Bottle Pours a clear brown with a large fizzy tan head. Head is lasting even though its very fizzy. Has a sweet fruity alcohol aroma. I get grapes, raisins, some apples a real fruit mix. Touches of cinnamon and nutmeg. The aroma is excellent on this one. Taste is on the dry side with a good mouthfeel. The 9% is hidden very well. Has a light feel. Verysmooth and extremely drinkable. The finish is subtle with a good duration. Leaves a very pleasent taste without a real aftertaste. This is a great beer. Drinks like water, goes down with total ease. If I could only drink one beer for the rest of my life this one deserves consideration."
"Quite the tasty trappist. Clean mouthfeel, heavy in carbonation at the start but this dissapates and leaves just good beer to speak for its self."
"A 750 ml bottle into a Chimay goblet ... I can't believe I had not reviewed this one heretofore. Pours a slightly cloudy brown color with a boisterous off-white head and sporadic lacing. Head is not well retained, except from a swirl of the glass. Nose is of sweet malt, dried fruits, and yeast. Taste is consistent with the style and quite good ... very earthy, rich, and complex with the yeast/malt interplay. This one (blue label) has a considerable hop profile as well, adding complexity and a balance to the sweet malt and fruits. This ale has a pleasing warmingeffect and is quite ""alive"" with carbonation and alcohol. Finish is silky and well balanced with a lingering warmth. I've always favored the Chimay blue for some reason, over the others. A standard in my book. If you've not tried it, try it. Among the best in the world? No, but very good and worth the price for sure. Among the best ""everyday"" tripels perhaps."
"Poured a deep brown, almost black color with a medium tan head into a Duvel tulip glass. The aroma is sweet, carmelized malts and some floral notes in the background. There are also spice notes throughout. The taste gave me more of the caramel and malts that I enjoy and a goog balance with hops. This beer, as expected, has a nice taste that lingers in the mouth a bit and definitely warants having a few."
"Mouthfeel is a tad zippy with the carbonation but still remains smooth for the most part, hiding the 9% well in the slightly sweet brew."
"Drinkability- About what I expected. Very good, but nothing spectacular. Worth the money and will probably pick up again at sometime. Definitely worth trying. Very tasty."
"The appearance is brown and heady. The smell suggests grain and carbonation.So far so good but the taste actually isn't that great. It is moderate as far as complexity goes.and the taste of grain is evident. The alcohol taste is also noticeible and less than ideal. The mouthfeel is a little sharp and not full bodied. Personally, I don't think this beer is that great and would compare it to Duvel. My trappist favorite is still the Westmalle Tripel."
"750 ml ""Grande Reserve"" cellared for over one year- Pours a slightly hazed dark amber/garnet color. An off-white, soapy head rushes above three fingers then falls to a thick cap of dense foam with good retention. Spotty lacing. Fusel alcohol in the nose, some roasted malt and dark fruit aromas, and belgian phenols. Sweet dark malt flavor, a hint of plum, and a faint grape skin taste make up a complex palate. Phenols are strong in the aftertaste, and the fusels become spicy- leaving the mouthfeel a touch dry. The carbonation is mild, and the body is medium to full- but subtle hops and spicy alcohol give it a delicate crispness. Some phenols will carry into the finish, and bit of residual sweetness from the roasted malt, but mostly clean and very drinkable considering the style. Overall, an excellent balance of flavor that showcases the marvelous belgian character."
"All in all, it's great, but you can find much better examples for less money."
"Served form a 750ml bottle into a chimay glass. Color is a rich reddish brown, with a decent tan head that sticks around for a good while. The smell only hints at the variety of flavors that are contained within. It seems like each taste gives you a new profile of flavors, there are more rich flavors contained within than I would be able to name. This is a wonderful beer that compliments any meal or occasion."
"I really like Chimay Bleu regardless of the slaggy the Chimay products get. miles above most."
"pours a dark though still translucent brown with a medium light brown head that has significant staying power. little to no lacing which surprised me. smells of earthy hop, sweet malt and candi, and a little toffee. taste matches nose but with sweet and earthy dominating. those two standing out strong and still being individually discernable is very interesting. tasty. a light body for such a strong brew along with the sweetness make this dangerously drinkable for such an alcohol-filled drink. i love it."
"Sorta smells like a spiced baking ham. Kinda an amalgamation of sweet brown sugar and cloves. Looks beautiful. If this beer was a woman Donald Trump would want to have a 4 million dollar wedding with it. Dark brown with a huge frothy mocha head that fades too soon. Tastes like bread pudding soaked in spiced rum with a little brown sugar and dried fruits thrown in. Very lip smacking malt base. Improves vastly as it warms. I really need to get a fridge that stays at 55 F."
"Excellent."
"Chimay blue is amazing...pours well with a medium to larger head with little lacing. The smell is good but not the best I have ever had. Malts and caramel comes to mind. The taste is outstanding. Cloves and spice are definately there. The alcohol taste is barely noticable. Another one of those beers that can get up into trouble if you have a case of this stuff. All around best Belgian ale I have had in my short reviewing career."
"Rustic caramel flavor. Alcohol is more evident than in the white. Very deep complex flavor."
"d - I would drink this any time anyplace. It goes with everything. I think it would be a great ale to serve someone who never drank anything but ""yellow fizz"". It has taste, character and drinkability. The worst part of drinking Chimay is getting to the bottom of the glass."
"Served in a snifter. The color is murky brown with a nice head that dissipates very fast. Decent active carbonation. Lacing is unremakrable. The smell is sort of faint, somewhat fruity with the aroma of belgian yeast. Taste is of sour apple and spice intitially, there is a hint of cloves present also. The finish is dry and alcoholic, not very bitter, it actually tastes like Bourbon, suprisingly. The beer has a medium thickness on the palate, is adequately bubbly, but could use some more body. This beer was not what I had expected. Not that exquisite, not all that drinkable for a Belgian."
"Poured very nicely, dark burgundy/ruby color, excellent thick head. A very inviting smell, and mouthfeel. Perhaps a hint of raisins, and a bit spicy. The taste however was almost like drinking Methyl Ethyl Keytone. Very harsh, strong, chemical alcohol taste to it. I could not finish the whole bottle. I will try this beer again, but will let it age a couple years and then see."
"The beer pours a dark burgandy color with a sizeable off white head with good retention and lacing. The beer smells of berry-like fruits. Most likely grapes, raisens, and cherries. The taste also exhibits these qualities in larger amounts. The beer feel quite thick and is balanced with a nicely generours amount of carbonation. I would love to drink this all the time."
"This is a great beer and I'm reviewing it with the respect it deserves; But my experience has been seriously diminished by the fact that I can get the same thing for less money from a closer brewery than Belgium."
"Mohogany with a fizzly big-bubbled head that doesn't last long (could it have been the glass? jeez, that was not a good head) The beer continues to sizzle like a soda for a long time. Aroma is very metallic at first in its chilled state, much less so as it warms. A bit of fig, but more of date. Decent peppery phenolics. Rhubarb. The flavor is sweet, with too much root beerishness, probably helped by a vinous quality. Carbonation is also reminiscent of soda, and at the end there is a sugar/alcohol coating in my mouth. Overall a bit hot, yet soda-like. I have had this a few times and, while I don't remember being thrilled with it (I always preferred the red), I do not remember the blue being this lackluster. Improves a lot as it warms to room temp, so DRINK IT WARM, but still not anything memorable."
"Back in the day, I used to get horrible headaches from too much of this stuff so it was a rare treat. This particular bottle seemed very drinkable, but overall I would recommend taking this beer easy."
"Pours a mahogony brown with a good head but poor longevity and lace. Smells of caramel, toffee, raisin, plum and mild chocolate. Main taste of raisin and plum with toffe and chocolate. Decent bitterness and not much alcohol flavor. High carbonation. Somewhat smooth and creamy. An OK beer but I think this one will improve greatly with cellaring. I think I will but more and give it a try."
"Pours a dark brown with some slight ruby highlights around the edges, and forms a creamy, tan head that stays well, leaving great lacing as I drink my way down the Chimay goblet that came with the sampler pack that I found on sale at the local NSLC outlet. Smells of spicy fruits with a bready overtone and some alcoholic notes as well. Tastes beautiful, raisins and cloves with the classic belgian breadiness and not even a hint of the 9% ABV, which is hidden magnificently. Mouthfeel is creamy and smooth, and nicely warming. Drinkability is excellent. If it wasn't closed I'd go to the liquor store and buy another right now. And it's -10 and snowing hard right now."
"A good brew, don't get me wrong, but certainly not worth the pricetag!"
"This is awesome, can't wait to try the 2005 vintage in 2007!"
"Overall: A very good beer which I enjoyed. Put two of the in the cellar, hoping that time mellows the powerful presance of the alcohol."
"First off, this beer is a little expensive, I had the 25oz bottle for $12. I never regretted it though. It's very dark red and has a rich rich malt with a slight raisin taste. It has that characteristic Belgian funk that really adds to the experience by making it taste and feel more substantial. I don't know what kind of hops were used, but they were fantastic. To top it all off, this beer is 9%ABV and doesn't taste like it at all and probably even adds to the thickness this beer exudes. After downing this and a few yuenglings I was glad I ate that steak earlier."
"WOWOWOWOWOWOWOWOW!"
"2003 Vintage. Pours a cloudy brown, pretty opaque, big off soapy white head forms, with plenty of chunkies floating around, lots of lace. Smell is molasses/brown sugar, chocolate, caramel, floral, iron, some yeast. Taste is chocolate, caramel, floral hops, and a clean bitter finish. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, high carbonation, and some alcohol warmth. Not as complex as the other Trappists but a damn fine belgian."
"The beer always seems to be beautifully crafted no mind what all the Chimay haters say. Dark earthy brown with a tapioca like head , the nose is old fruit and yeast. The taste is very refined and big with no rough edges.Albeit not as complex as St Bernardus or Westy this is one deep beer that is easy to find and a good value. Still one of my favourites years later."
"Gorgeous dark color with a nice thick head. Nice soft aromas with hints of fruit and hops. Plenty of fruitiness with tones of chocolate and coffee....went down ohh soo smooth. My 750ml bottle went dry way too quickly. I will definitely be purchasing another..."
"Drinkability/Overall: A stunning brew a great beer to sip slowly and just enjoy. This is a beautiful beer for any special occasion."
"so glad i picked this up. its filling though...hard to go above 4.0 on drinkability."
"Some more pepper, cloves good malt with some sweet syrup flavors and then finished with the pepper. Usual Belgian finish. Good drink and if you're not used to high ABV's just make sure this is the only one you hit. :)"
"Smooth, creamy and seductively easy to drink."
"Pours dark and rich with a thick off-white head. Complex, sweet and spicy nose. The first sip of Chimay blue is always the best, but the rest aren't bad, either. Hints of caramel and cherries. This beer rolls over the tongue like liquid chocolate and goes down so smooth. Strong, though. I was feeling the effects after one .75L bottle."
"Normally this is one of my favorite styles, so I was really looking forward to trying this. However, it was disappointing to say the least. The appearance was as expected; burgundy color with a lovely head that stays around. Aromas of plums, grapes, alcohol, and caramelized sugar come out, but they don't seem to be working together. This was my first inkling that I was in for a surprise. The taste was just too much with overwhelming sweetness upfront followed by a moist bitterness that left me not wanting anymore. The aftertaste was more sour and dry than would be enjoyable and the drinkability is low because I didn't want to finish my goblet. This is worth trying, but I didn't enjoy this nearly as much as other Trappist ales."
"Drinkability: A complex and nice to sip brew. Swirling this beer around the mouth is a cherished experience. Indeed, it is so pleasant that the alcohol can easily sneak up on you."
"Perhaps what this beer has that some of the huge quadruples cant achieve is drinkability- This is a world class beer with truly high drinkability. This is a certain must try for all beer enthusiasts."
"D- This is a dry yet complex beer in the background. The fizz takes over in the finish and the malt complexities are very subtle. It would be nice to have those stand out a bit, and perhaps that is the case when it is fresh."
"Overall a grand example of a strong dark Belgian and will go to when my wallet allows, beautiful in appearence and taste great to say the least. You will not be dissapointed."
"This bottle was dated 2003."
"Very tasty. I wouldnt mind having a case of this lying around."
"Great beer. Complex in different flavors and very tasty. What else can you say? This is a real beer. It's a landmark in craft brewing. One of the best Chimay has to offer and worth seeking out. Recommended."
"tastes so smooth and clean. wow. i would normally - for example see my unibroue reviews - prefer the lighter trippel, but in this case i like the dark better. this seems better balanced, no big surprises, very drinkable for how strong and dark it is !"
"Drinkability: On a cold night, great. If you can afford it, a few of these would go down well. Not a huge session beer for summer, though... one as your second beer would be best, if at all. Full of flavour, but not as gelatine-thick as some other strong Belgian ales."
"Taste is received first by the malts. Very creamy malt flavor followed by alcohol warming and a wet newspaper taste. Hop bitterness is not as evident as the astringency of the alcohol. Not bad, but not that memorable in my opinion."
"Excellent, excellent beer. Simply brilliant."
"Shared a big bottle of this at Zeno's. This beer is a nice dark, cloudy, and maybe a bit dark red. Nice big tan head which leaves some excellent lacing. Aroma is very sweet malt with lots of fruit complexities- apples, cherries, and strawberries can all be detected along with a bit of nice yeastiness in the background. Taste is malt again with tons of fruit complexities and some spicyness and yeastiness . This stuff has some nice bitterness to balance it all out as well along with a hint of alcohol- there's really a lot of stuff going on here and I like it. Has a nice full-bodied, not overly carbonated mouthfeel. Very warming and pretty drinkable for such a huge beer. Awesome stuff overall."
"Overall: Not terrible, but I can't see ever seeking this one out again. I thought the red and white were not-quite-stellar, but I far preferred them to this one."
"Drinkability: Lots of interesting stuff going on here, I would like to try this in a caouple years. Thanks to Px2Grafx for the bottle (and the glass)."
"Stay safe and drink da bluaw with easy."
"750ml bottle. Pours a dark brown/ruby color, very nice carbonation with a huge creamy head that lasts a long time. Very nice lacing afterwards. Scents. of malt, raisins/grapes. Very nice sweet/bitter taste with a slight alcohol warming feel. Medium body. This is a very drinkable brew from Chimay (my first by the way) at 9% ABV the alcohol is hidden very well. Highly recommended."
"This brew pours a dark brown color with amber hues along the edges. The head is off-white and creamy. The aroma is huge,spicy, and malty. The taste is malty and spicy with a hint of alcohol. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with lots of carbonation. Overall, this is a great brew."
"I will most definitely be buying more of this beer in the near future. I am very impressed by this beer, can't wait to buy some more of this stuff. I am very happy that I bought the one pint 9 ounce bottle after buying and drinking the small 11.2 ounce bottle. I just hope that the store I got the pint from still has some in stock. If I could I'd drink this all the time."
"Served from a 750ml bottle with 03/05 stamped on the cork. The champagne-like pop set the tone for my drinking experience. This ale had a small but pleasant head that remained throughout. Initial aroma was pungent and sour (yet intriguing), not unlike a lambic. Taste was smooth with the presence of alcohol becoming more prominent as the ale warmed. Mouthfeel was agreeable with the carbonation never overwhelming the omnipresent fruit-like flavors. Easily drinkable, but at $7.99/bottle, its one to be saved for special occasions."
"The taste is malt and fruit with just a slight hint of cloves and the 9%abv is pretty well hidden. Good stuff."
"Drinkability...I wouldn't recommend having too much of it at once, it is a 9% alc/vol beverage. But if you're with discerning friends, then popping the cork on this one is more than worth it (yes, the bottle I got had a cork)."
"This is a sipping beer indeed."
"Notes: Basically my banchmark for this style at this point. Can't wait to pick up the Rochefort 8 and compare it."
"Chimay has got another soild brew here. Poured out to a dark cider like color with a nice 1/2 inch head of almond cream foam, and some lace. Medium high carbonation. Impressive. Aroma of yeast that has been sitting, dark fruits, and some roasted nuts. Taste was along the same lines; Flavors of earth, herbs, spices, malt and yeast are noticeable, with nuances of roasted nuts and aged tobacco. Mouthfeel was smooth and rich, giving no indication of the 9%ABV. Drinkability for some reason doesn't seem all that high, as I think this brew is one you'd only want every once in awhile. Nonetheless, it's a superior brew that's well made, and worthy of your hard earned money. Recommended."
"D: There isn't any particular flavour that's overwhelming, very smooth, should be approachable by anyone. Slight taste of alcohol could be a barrier to the newbie... but VERY drinkable, considering it's strength!"
"Overall a nice dark Belgian that's definitely got some unique traits. The only thing that would keep me from buying it again would be the price tag."
"Drinkability is good overall. This bottle drank easily, but I was not left wanting for more. Next time I want a Belgian, I will go for the White or Red Chimay, (which I have not yet sampled), or have a Rochefort."
"Wonderful nouthfeel with the hop bite and the alcohol to soothe. Very pleasant. I would drink this beer all day if I could."
"Notes: My favorite offering from this brewery so far. One to go."
"An excellent beer."
"i would recommend this to anyone that likes the style. be careful! if you have multipe glasses of this and don't just sip it you're going to be feeling it very quickly."
"Small 12-oz bottle. I think the Red is still my favorite of the Chimay brands."
"This beer is very light despite the color and ABV and I find it quite drinkable."
"A fine brew and one I will revisit again."
"It's a deep brown, but not quite as murky as the Chimay premiere (red label) and doesn't have quite its bitterness. Something smooths out the taste and makes it a bit more drinkable."
"Notes: the best of Chimay (and my favorite)"
"Drinkability - As wonderful as this beer is, I challenege you to finish a bottle in an hour. It took two of us the entire length of a movie to finish a half bottle each. It's just *so* rich and thick that one glass feels like two to your stomach. Unfortunately, I had to dock it for that, but otherwise this beer is fantastic."
"It tastes like this... It smells like that... I don't think I can add anything to the scores of people who came before me on that front. What I can say is that this beer grows on you real time. As I started to drink it, I thought it was a little thin, but when I got to the end of the bottle I forgot all about this or that or ratings or 3-4-5, or whatever. The taste became more and more palatable, but more importantly, this beer offers a clean buzz (something unfortunately not discussed in these pages), that is really divine. Every drink has its own way with the brain cells, and this one is particulary gentle. My advise is that you should try it at least once in a life time, if not once a day."
"Rich ruby brown color and light brown lace around the glass. The aroma is filled with grape like fruits and sweet maltiness. A full body with a syrupy mouthfeel. Sweet and roasted malts. Nutty fruit flavors roll around the tounge. Slightly dry and bitter finnish. Truely a work of art. Finer than any wine in my book!"
"This brew is smooooth; EASY to drink, but it should be respected and savored. Its highly worth it."
"Overall this is a serious beer. Powerful, potent, tasty, but balanced. I look forward to trying more Trappist style beers soon."
"I've neglected Chimay for quite a while, basically since I noticed that I could rather enjoy Ommegang for only $5). I was in the mood for something special last night, after wandering into Chesapeake Fine Wine in the mood for antipasti and pizza. Poured heavily into a thick Chimay chalice, you get a beautiful dark reddish brown brew with a fluffy off-white head. Could have used a bit better retention or lacing, but that could have been the glass. Delicious malty aroma that was both fruity and nutty. Creamy, malty, delicious fruits, nuts and berries dance around with a perfect combonation of carbonation. Highly drinkable, the 750 didn't stand a chance. The only thing holding it back is the price here in the states..."
"Drinkability: I love beer like this. Can sit around drinking it and thinking or have it with a nice meal. Very versatile, but I wouldn't go around getting hammered off this stuff."
"Dark brown in color with an off white head. A delicate and complex brew. Smells of mint, a just-opened box of wooden matches, spices, and yeast. Intricate flavors of yeast, subtle berry fruits, caramel, and toasted oak. Full mouthfeel with a fair bit of carbonation. Quite important to drink this one at a slightly warm temperature to get all of the aromatic and flavor nuances. WOW!"
"While it is largely a matter of personal taste, this is by far my favourity Chimay...this is a beer I will happily and heartily recommend."
"Pours a very dark mahogany color with slight ruby highlights and a nice, frothy tan head that retains very well. Aroma is a nice blend of fruits; i detect apple, pear, fig and plum as well as candy sugar, and light hints of chocolate, phenols and herbal hops. Flavor is very complex and the profile changes as it warms; first you get a big fruit flavor with hints of apple, pear, fig and plum as well as slight hints of chocolate and a nice candy sugar sweetness, then there are some phenolic flavors and a lightly bitter hop flavor (grassy, hop tea and mineraly) that dries out the brew for the finish and balances quite well. Mouthfeel is smooth with a medium to heavy body and a moderate carbonation that increases drinkability. A very nice brew, complex and delicious...another winner from Chimay."
"All in all this is a superb drink that I would never think twice about enjoying again."
"Notes: I felt like I was a young teenager again drinking a beer for the first time. I don't think my palate or taste is aquired enough to fully enjoy this beer yet. But thanks to a newly popped cap it soon will be."
"Overall: This is one to have every once in a while especially since its $4 for a small bottle here. Something to enjoy on special occasions or when you really want to treat yourself to one of the best. You deserve the best so go ahead and enjoy!"
"Those Trappists. How do they do it?"
"Overall, a nice tasting full bodied brew, that only has one knock- the amount of carbonation that killed my palete."
"For as dark and strong, this is a very drinkable brew!"
"Opinion: I am a bit shocked that my palate is so blasted. I have been drinking Saisons tonight, so this beer is really smooth and clean in comparison. I have drank this beer on many occasions, and I'll plan to score it according to how I know it to be. I'll be back soon, and I'll plan to make this beer my first of the evening."
"Thanks to ""Pop the Cap"" for making this legal in NC!"
"Body is medium, slick, smooth, and creamy textured. I polish off the whole 750 with ease. Love those Monks!"
"Overall drinkability is fairly high -- for a beer that's this high in alcohol, it goes down smooth and does not give me anything of an unpleasant aftertaste. At $5.00 a bottle, this beer isn't something I can afford every day, but it's almost one that I _wish_ I could afford every day."
"Drinkability: Very nice, but I've enjoyed other Belgians more"
"Tastes has lots of oakiness. Hints of vanilla. Molasses. Rich malt. Bready. Bitter finish. Rich in the mouth. A decent sipper but somehow it doesn't all come together. Aroma is magnificent but taste can't live up to it. I have to say I like the White and the Red better."
"D: Overall, this is a beer of very high quality. It's not my favorite Belgian, but I anticipate drinking this one again."
"This was a smooth, flavorful beer, but I did expect a little more out of it. Perhaps a sampling of an aged bottle is in line for me..."
"Appearance is dark auburn with a foamy head and some lacing. Aroma has yeast, fruit, brown sugar. Initial taste is full of yeast, currants, ethanol and brown sugar. Foam is minimal with not much lacing. Body is thin, carbonation medium. Initial taste has notes of malt, yeast, plums, but little hops. Fruits increase as the temperature warms the beer. Finishes dry but with a peculiar aftertaste."
"A special tasting of a well aged 16-year old versions (1996 vintage enjoyed in April '12) at the cellars of the Chimay monistary reveals less hop bitterness, less peppery bite, but heightened sherry-like vinous quality that melds together wonderfully with a smooth powdery finish and surprisingly creamy yet low-lying carbonation. This beer ages beautifully under the right circumstances!"
"this wonderful brew pours into the goblet dark opaque with hints of amber color. beautiful thick off-white head tops this delight. some lacing and amazing head retention. smells fairly mild, mostly sweet and bready. tastes fruity up front, hint of bananas. it finishes with a slight bitterness and mild burn of alcohol. this delicious treat was quite rich and smooth, only complaint would be a little over carbonated. if i had any money, this beer would be a weekly event."
"Pours a deep, mahogany color. Great big head on top. Decent lacing. Sulfury and yeasty aroma. Reminds me of the dregs of a fermenter. Not a lot there that stands out. A lot of malt upfront flavor wise. Spicy and peppery throughout. I find it fairly one dimensional. The typical ""Belgian"" yeasts flavor dominates the whole thing. Theres nothing too discernable. Ok body for the style. An average beer overall. Theres some much better beers of this style out there. This just seems like the Sam Adams of Belgians to me. Nothing special and doesnt take too many chances."
"Overall a fine Trappist Ale; good flavor, great mouthfeel, and wonderful eye candy. The alcohol presence isn't overpowering, but it does keep this ale from session status in my book."
"Overall  a world class beer. Unfortunately the bottles I have tasted so far havent been very old. Have a couple cellared now though"
"What better beer to select for my #100. Poured from a 750ml bottle that opened with explosive force.Color is deep ruby-copper color with smallish head. Smell is slighty fruity (raisins) with some malt undertones. Taste was nice and creamy and felt excellent on the tongue. A great beer to enjoy with friends. Goes great with a juicy steak done on the grill."
"Pours a dark chestnut with a thick and creamy tan head that left lots of lacing. Aroma was fruity, yeasty and sweet. Taste was rich dark malts, caramel and slight hop tang. Mouthfeel was smooth and creamy and was a perfect compliment to the ""Steak Frites."" Lunch was nirvana. Staying awake til five is going to be a challenge. Cheers."
"This is a smooth drinking brew with just the right tingle of carbonation and hops in the finish. I'm glad that I have this whole bottle to myself for my first experience with Chimay. I will buy this Reserve again, but will look for it in smaller bottles."
"Poured out a deep shade of copper with some good ruby highlights. Big head as well with this one which had to settle down. Smell consisted of yeast at first, but some big dark fruit aromas surge forth. Some underlyinng of malts and roasted aromas. Taste was good. Complex flavors which included dark fruits, yeast, nuts, malts, slight hops, chocolate and roasted flavors. Finished dry which was good to see. Mouthfeel was medium-full boded with good carbonation. The best out of the Chimay lineup for sure. No problems with this beer whatsoever. Recommended."
"NOTE: tasted 2004 batch on 31st Oct 2005. All of the above notes apply except for an improved smell. Very nice beer; DO NOT OVERCHILL!"
"11.2 oz. bottle sampled at a small little cafe in Florence. Pours a dark, raisiny murky cola brown with a cobweb-lace-inducing light brown head. Muy nice looking. Nose is dark fruits: plums, raisins, vinous grapes. Some chocolate and roasted notes come through. Light, but crescendo-ing bitterness leads to a yeasty, sherry-ish finish that's drier than you'd think. Full bodied and rich with a nice, creamy feel that never gets cloying. Not my favorite Trappist, but plenty good and you have to appreciate the availability."
"pour and enjoy!"
"This one pours a dark brown with a tan head that sticks around for a long time. Excellent aroma. It smells of dark fruit, alcohol, and a little spice. The taste is also a little spicey with flavors of some of the darker variety fruits such as dates, plum, and raisins. The mouthfeel is good. Perfect amount of carbonation for this brew. I would say this is a very drinkable beer considering the Alcohol content. I would definately recommend this beer to anyone who likes great beer."
"The drinkability, well, as always. i've said it- the alcohol is there, no one's hiding it. but god, don't I crave for another?"
"Its a tad better than average on drinkability for this style. A little too strong abv-wise for me to really consider it very drinkable."
"This beer feels great in your mouth. You notice the carbonation but only because it is there, not because it gets in the way. The bubbles are very fine, like champagne, and add to the feeling. It is smooth and chocolatey, a great malt flavor when it first hits your tongue. As it moves back and you swallow it, the light, dry hops add some bite. This is the reverse to a lot of beers I've had where the dryness leads and the malt finishes. The alcohol content wasn't noticeable, either. It blends in well. And since it is a beer you want to slow down and savor, it shouldn't be a problem as you enjoy it."
"Phenomenal taste. I find myself inhaling the vapors before every sip. Each sip starts robustly and ends smoothly, tickly on the mouth. Warming me on a miserable late spring New England afternoon."
"Pours a dark reddish copper with a about an inch of head. Half of the head fades away. It's highly carbonated and there is lots of yeast floating in it. The smell is awesome, quite strong and you can instantly smell malt and fruit. The taste is very smooth and strong with hints of fruit. Mouthfeel is smooth and nicely carbonation.At first I didn't really care for this ale, but after just a few more sips it grew on me rather quick. The only thing that might turn some people off is the amount of yeast in the beer. I've never seen so much yeast before, but I definately still enjoyed this one."
"Pours a dark purply brown. Foamy head, light carbonation. Not much in the nose. Smells like a sugary Belgian. Taste is citrusy, plum and alcohol. Mouthfeel is medium, I expect more fullness from a strong dark. Despite the alcohol bite, this is a smooth beer. I prefer the red over this, but I wouldn't pass one up if offered."
"Bottle. Poured a slightly hazy (as far as I could tell) dark chocolate amber with a good creamy head and plenty of lacing. Aroma was much more subtle than expected, with very little hint of the high alcohol content. Subtle sweet caramel malty notes. This extends through to the taste which starts sweet and malty and finishes with a slightly dry alcoholic bite. Mouth is quite creamy, I think the carbonation is about right. This is a very smooth, subtle strong dark which seems to improve with each sip."
"Thhis is a malty full bodies beer with a creamy mouthfeel and soft carbonation. It has an average flavor duration with a moderate to heavy sweetness. Light acidity and bitterness offset by the sweet malt that has a caramel flavor that lasts as a nice aftertaste."
"It's easy to find bottles on the shelf that have been aged for a year or two, and they are great with a couple years under their belt."
"Truly a beer that lives up to its hype."
"Mouthfeel is fairly light with a hefty amount of carbonation. I'd like to see the bubbles cut down a bit as it's a bit much. For a 9% brew this is very drinkable...I'm only drinking the 11.2oz bottle..however a 750 would be no problem."
"This is a great brew, but for the money Uni's Terrible, Trois Pistoles or Maudite is a better choice"
"Nonetheless, an impressive contender in the line-up."
"Drinkability and Overall: A classic ale that may be a bit overrated. It's a very good beer, but not as good as it could be. A tad dissapointing, but enjoyable none-the-less."
"next step is to try more of this aged. a solid brew for sure. the king of beers for the uninitiated holds up to nostalgia.. somewhat."
"This one tastes ripe. Id like to come back to Chimay Bleu 09/04 at 2 6-month intervals."
"Amber brown color, with a nice creamy mocha chocolate colored head. Mixtures of alcohol malt and spice in the nose. Taste starts lite, with roasted malt on the tongue. Finishes with a strong dose of alcohol bite, which leaves a tingle on the taste buds as it fades away ever so slowly. Outstanding!"
"The beer poured a dirty brown colot with a 2 finger head that stuck around rather well. The nose was light, with a slight raisin and slight spiceyness. The flavor was nice, with a raisiney and spicey quality with a touch of alcohol to accentuate the spice. The feel was moderate with a decent carbonation. I would like a touch more body on it. Overall, everything seemd a bit thin for me. I enjoyed it though."
"In my mind, certainly an above average brew but far from superior."
"Beer is good. Happy beering."
"Slàinte!"
"This brew varies a bit from bottle to bottle and year to year, as it should. I have never before caught a whiff of sweet corn in the nose, as I did this evening. But it's always delicious, satisfying and complex."
"Drinkability: Good, would drink another. However the beer is a bit pricey. Stops me from drinking too many."
"An impressive beer, no doubt, and certainly one to respect."
"My least favorite of the three Chimays (the Cinq Cents by far at the head of my list), this is none-the-less a well-rounded and complex beer."
"Certainly not hard to drink, but not something I'll run back to right away. Finishing the enitre bottle over an hour was not hard, but this is not a brew I plan to stock up on."
"Notes: Readily available. The 9% is very elusive. Price is not it's strong side. You do get what you pay for, however."
"Nice beer, even nicer when it warms up a bit. This is much richer and more potent than chimay red, certainly a store and pour also."
"One word sums it up, wow!!! I am so glad this beer is at my local TJ's store. Bought this beer in the 75cl bottle, and poured into a nice tulip glass. This is what all beers should aspire to look like. Pours with a nice head that dwindles down to a perfect creamy lace. The dark color, the carbonation is a beautiful thing to look at. The nose and taste is incredibly complex, just as complex as any good red wine that I have had. On the nose you get a nice sweetness, maybe figs??? Some of the medicinal phenol. man, this is some good stuff. Rasins some nice hoppiness, the question is what can't you smell, this is really complex. This goes for the taste as well. Sweetness, with a nice bite at the end. I have died and gone to beer heaven, I would love to pair this beer with some real gammy meat. Maybe rabbit, venison, or duck. This beer is GRRREAT!!!"
"When I first read reviews of this beer it was well into the top 100 rated beers, but has since fallen short. 330 mL bottle with no year on the bottle as I hear they usually do for the blue. Pours into the Chimay chalice a dark dark brown with a hint of red and a 2 finger tan head that reduces to a creamy blanket of foam and leaves nice lacing. Has a fruity aroma with bananas, raisins, lemons, cloves, spiciness, nuts, and yeast. The beer tastes sweet with cloves, phenols, alcohol, and hops in the background. Leaves a warming sensation. Lots of flavor that is blended well and is slightly cloying. Beer feels somewhat thick and has a crisp carbonation at first that becomes very creamy. Drinkability is crazy for a 9% beer - couldn't put it down. Wish it were a 750 mL bottle. Great beer, especially for cold winter nights."
"500th beer reviewed...been saving this one the past week or so to take the honor. Small bottle w/o freshness dating. Pours very dark, cloudy and murky, almost black. Fairly large bubble head at first, puffy and lumpy. Head slowly morphs to a 1/8th inch thick tiny bubble film Thick sticky lacing left on the glass. Nose is of powered sugar, fresh fruit, and concord grapes. Smooth medium bodied Belgian, notes of yeast, peppery spicing, tons of sweet malt and more fruity notes, warming alcohol late seals the deal. World class, classic for good reason. Cheers!"
"The simple but attractive blue-labelled Chimay bottle with a best before of 2008 on the back right corner poured a dark chestnut liquid into my chalice, topped with a head befitting for a Trappist. A dark beer, untransparent, dense and full looking. Held to the light the red becomes apparent, as does the caramel-tinged edges. Against a purely white background though, this beer is dark rosewood or chestnut. A very light brown head, dark cream coloured. At first it was a good mixture of medium and small sized bubbles; after a few sips, the head formed up and became dense and solid, though not exceptionally large. From above, this beer could pass for the top of a moccha coffee. Swirling the glass creates a lighter-coloured swirl, like a hurricane seen from the top. Fine screen lacing that fragments quickly. The nose is all fruits and malt at first. I get some green apple peel, figs, prunes, red grapes(red wine for that matter), and raisins. The malt translates as light caramel, fresh yeast, extremely sweet chocolate, but NOT the same chocolate character as in some stouts. The mustiness of the yeast is also present, but only behind the sweet malt and yeasty esters. As in all complex beers, there are some aromas that seem to defy identification. Little hop presence in aroma, or taste. The taste is sweet, but less so than the aroma may have led you to expect. Instead, the alcohol is quite noticeable, gently abrasive to the tongue. Grapes and malty sugar at first on the tongue, the phenols in the middle, and some metallic maltiness in the aftertaste, also leaving some unexpected bitterness, but it does not taste like hop dryness--this is more metallic in nature, like iron or some wines. Indeed, the finish is slightly bitter in a red-wine manner, leaving a red wine taste on the palate quite strongly. A medium carbonation, perfect for the style, sufficiently creamy but tingling in the mouth; and for a strongly flavoured Trappist, the drinkability is magnificent. This pairs agreeably with aged cheddar, or even medium cheddar. This is a Trappist that needs to be tasted repeatedly, as all the nuances can simply not be detected on the first try. In addition, different food pairings can make this beer exciting and different almost perpetually."
"Poured a dark, reddish that is very clear and a white two inch fluffy head that subsided to a thin ring. Aroma was dry with a nice mineral character mingling with dark fruity esters. The flavor is very smooth and clean with more of the malt flavor dominating than in a fresh example. Rich dark fruit flavors interplay with a subdued dry malt flavor that is more balanced in the aged version. As this bottle aged I believe that it attenuated a bit more which resulted in an overall cleaner impression of the flavor. CO2 levels are high but the beer still remains smooth with no carbonic bite. Overall a very enjoyable ale that having been aged takes on a smoother more drinkable nature while also gaining a touch of oxidation which imparts a subtle raisin flavor. The flavor seems more round than a in a fresh example and having had this one I would recommend that all chimays of adequate strength be aged for at least a year."
"This poured a dark amber, nice thick head, that diminished, but left rocky peaks all the way down, smell was fruity and complex, raisin scent present, taste was full complex fruit,... again I distinguish a raisin flavor, a bit of tartness, but finishes smooth, bit of spiciness as well, in my opinion these quality beers, are very hard to describe, beautiful, say's it all, mouthfeel was high carbonated bubbles that tickled the tongue, and a rich creaminess, drinkability is as with all the Trappist biers, X-cellent! Highly Recommended!"
"Drinkability suffers a little because of the sweetness and slight overcarbonation."
"Out of the stubby little 33 cl. brown bottle, and into a tulip, the beer looked dark red, with a two inch thick foamy head fed by lively carbonation beneath. The fruity, spicy, chocolaty aroma accentuated the malty nature of the brew. The taste was warming and mellow with the very sweet fruity malt chasing the dusty yeast and powered cocoa into the background. It was not as complex as other Trappist ales, but was quite satisfying in its own way. Full bodied and sticky, with a lingering spicy dry aftertaste, and just a touch of grassy hops. Alcohol warmth is felt long after the glass is drained, making this a wonderful beer to cap one of those cold winter nights."
"As I poured the beer my first thought is oh my! The beer pours a dark brown, with a light tan color for the head. The smell is of figs,prune, and raisins. At 9% abv you can faintly smell the alcohol but it is not overpowering. The taste is delicious, if you hold the beer on your palate...the sweet carmel flavors, and spices are really present. This is a very well crafted beer one you can sip all night."
"this is a big but subtle beer, with tons of complexity. a very nice treat."
"edit: I finally gave this beer a second try last night after sitting on the 750ml bottle for quite some time. I noticed that the spiciness I didn't like about it before was much more mellow after the beer warmed. Last time I had it out of one of the small bottles, so it didn't have a chance to warm to room temp like this bigger bottle did. Once it reached room temperature, this was actually quite delicious even with the subdued clove flavor. Nonetheless, I think Chimay is still my least favorite of the Trappists, but I have much more respect for their style after having tried it again."
"The Blue label Chimay pours an opaque reddish brown color and produces a big frothy head that slowly settles down leaving no lacing. Smell is of spices, particularly cloves, with vinous hues. First taste leaves a smooth chocolate impression ending with touches of fruit. Aftertaste is yeasty. Overall, not a very complex taste, but highly enjoyable. Mouthfeel is very good, and that about says it, really. One I'd definitely have again. A good no-frills Belgian beer you could drink everyday."
"Overall, I'm obviously dissapointed, and kinda pissed off. I mean, some Belgians I've had have been superb, and some have been not to my liking at all. I read reviews and it's hard to tell because everyone has different tastes. When I originally started drinking more hoppy beers, I didn't really like them much, but now I adore them. However, I really don't think this is a taste I will become accustomed to. Spices/cloves are something that I think should have their place in food, not in my beer."
"1.5L magnum from 2000. Shared with company on new years eve. Champagne like pop of the cork. Hazy chestnut color with a tan head. Musky, wood barrel aged smell. Light to medium bodied. Nice carbonation. The taste mirrors the smell with the oak barrel aged flavor.This brew didn't age as well as I'd expected. Still not bad, though."
"Drinkablity is Very good, especially for a beer this big. Finished a 750ml and would easily start in on another if I had one with me. Great Beer!"
"Comments - This beer is definitely worth a try. This is not one of my preferred styles."
"God bless the Monks of Chimay. This beer is heaven on earth."
"An average beer...Chimay remains very average all around for me."
"Pours a dark reddish brown with an excellent head. Very nice lacing on the glass. This is definately one that should be enjoyed from the suggested glass. It helps to enhance both the aroma and taste. The slightly sweet taste helps to mask the high alcohol content. The overall drinkability is very smooth with great mouthfeel. This is always one that I use to introduce people to the world of better beers that are available to all."
"Overall, this is an incredibly solid beer that I often go back to, one of the best trappist brews there is in my opinion. My favourite in this style. Highly recommended!"
"Revieuwing one I drink so often is always hard.. what to say about a beer youre in love with! Great appearance with the darkbrown colour, good head that last during the whole drink. Nose is nicely balanced batle between (roasted)malts, hops an yeastfruits, great again. Full cara,roast and otherbarleymalts and candysugar( is it, anyway thats what I taste...) Together with a clean sweetbitter aftertaste makes this beer into an enjoyable sip."
"This beer totally changed the way I think of perfect. The apperance throws one off, a deep dark mohagany and brown with tan head. The smell however is light, fruity and floral. Hints of citrus zest and banana and apples with a slight earthy tone, thick bread smell. The taste is light and fruity, bananas and apples on the forefront and a nice herbal spice lingers, the rear is a nice complimentary light malt that brings you to want to drink again, as you continue to taste you will pick up on bread and earthy tones, very complex. Medium bodied and perfect to celebrate any occasion, or just perfect for a twilight evening."
"Pours a dark, hazy brown, with a foamy tan head. Yeasty, aroma of dark fruits, prunes and rum. Flavour is complex. Full of dark fruitiness, yeast, chocolate. Mouthfeel is thick and syrupy. Drinkability is lacking at 9% abv. Alcohol is warming, but for me, there's just a bit too much."
"This is a fine beer. Hopefully there will still be some left next time I go. But will I have the courage to brave the hordes of anti-beer gesture-makers on the subway? If I drink a few of these first, then probably."
"Belgian dark beer. A good beer, but did not go well with the crocodile meal I had with it. Oh well. Pours a dark, brown and black colour with a huge, white, firm head. Lace is sticky like tape. Smells of raising, figs, plums, malts and alcohol. Taste is sweet and a bit harsh. Lots of malts and dark fruits, blended with a phenol alcohol bite. Mouthfeel is a bit thick and chewy. Drinkable, but I prefer the chimay red. I still need a better appreciation of these dark ales. I like them, but I don't love them as much as the pales. Too sweet for me."
"Had this a long long time ago, before my BA days, and recently just had a sip of my friend's and I was reminded how damn good this stuff is. So I went out and got some. 750ml corked bottle. Pours a transparent brown color, not too dark, nice and smooth looking with a huge tan head full of swiss cheese like holes. Smell is very inviting, very rich. Smells of sweet toasted malts and spiced fruits, perhaps a little dark rum thrown in, with a dash of mustiness. Taste is fabulous. Lots of flavors, lots of complexities. Very bready, but not like your standard loaf. More like pumpkin bread or banana bread or something else sweet like that. A tad woodsy too, with Belgian spices and a touch of bitter hops. Medium bodied but very smooth tasting, not light but not too heavy, despite the brown color. I would drink this beer all the time if it didn't cost as much. Despite it being one of the more popular/commercial/well-know Belgian beers out there, it's with out a doubt one of the best."
"Drinkability: This is the most perfect beer that I've ever had...and probably the closest to perfect that I'll have for quite some time. An unfailing choice, really. I would make this my beer-of-choice if it weren't for the $15 price tag on my single 1-Litre bottle! A must-try beer!"
"from the bottle. poured brown with tan head. aroma roasted malts, raspberries, plums, yeast alcohol, hints of citrus.flavor caramel,fruity, licorice, alcohol, hints of grapefruit, as this warmed the grapefruit got stronger. liked the bitterness. a good beer"
"Overall a good choice to be had. I would drink this regularly if it wasn't so (comparitively) expensive."
"Pours nice dark garnet with a thick off-white head that's rather lively. Aroma of biscuits, dark fruits, and a bit of sour yeast, slightly winey. Taste was quite complex, starts with dark fruits, malts kick in the middle and then some hops and bitterness in the finish. Very smooth, and not as sweet as I remembered. The high ABV is rather nicely hidden, making this dangerously drinkable... Considering popping one of these of New Year's if I can find one."
"Pretty good beer, but not great. Nice dark color with nice initial head which quickly dissipates. Taste is malty sweet from residual sugar and spicy from typical Belgian yeast esters. Not overly complex. I finished almost the whole 750 mL bottle by myself and it was FREE at the office Christmas party. So I'm in an extra good mood about this. Pretty drinkable. Other non-beer people who had sips enjoyed."
"This is a ruby brown ale that poured a 4 finger head that is leaving a bit of residue. It is cloudy with plenty of yeast sediment. Nose is of spicy Belgian yeast. Taste is of dark fruity malt to start fading into a smooth slightly detectable alcohol finish. Mouthfeel is good, lively but not overly carbonated. Overall drinkability is good. This is a very well put together brew. The high ABV and cost will limit me to 1 sampling but two samples are very doable!"
"It's good, a beer that I wouldn't mind having again soon."
"This beer pours a deep chocolate color with an invincible head and swathes of lace that coat the glass like shaving cream. The aroma is of dried dark fruits dusted in cocoa powder, fresh plums and caramel malts. The taste is malty with a clear dark candy sugar flavor. Theres and chocolate and all spice flavors, maybe some cloves as well. Hoppiness is very minimal and the alcohol is subdued for the lofty ABV. The mouthfeel is smooth and slightly tingly from a plethora of little bubbles. This is a near perfect dark Belgian beer. Excellent."
"Supposedly it benefits from aging. It could only get better."
"Grande Reserve is my favorite of the three Chimay beers (as I was pretty sure it would be), but I can't help feel that it doesn't quite deserve its reputation. The best thing about it is that it's pretty widely available. There are quite a few BSDAs, however, that I like a whole lot more."
"There was some good body to this beer, and it was the most drinkable of the Chimay line IMHO. Overall a pleasurable experience."
"The mouthfeel is very good, being both full and pleasing. Drinkability starts high and only seems to get better as I consume more."
"This beer pours a medium brown. I didn't give it time to settle after transport, so the sediment was in suspension and gave it a murky look. Small head. Appropriate level of mild carbonation. Aroma is earthy and somewhat musty. Perhaps some grape too. Flavor profile is moderate malt with that Belgian yeast character, not a strong candi sugar presence. Minimal bitterness but detectable. A little rough. Medium to full bodied. Alcohol is subtle. Overall, surprisingly complex, non-offensive, surprisingly drinkable."
"This is one of the best beers ever brewed. It pours a dark, hazy brownish color and has a ton of fine carbonation and a fat off-white head that leaves little lace on my glass. The aroma is as complex as the flavor and you would need a book to properly describe it. It has a very sweet, spicy malty character that is a mind blowing experience. The only thing holding this beer back is it's price... $13 at my local liquor store. That said, I buy it whenever I feel the need to pamper myself with a great Belgian beer. This is brewing at it's pinnacle."
"Pours a brownish garnet kind of hue with an effervescent white head that lasts forever. Yeasty spicy aroma that matches the taste. Malty yeasty mouthfeel with a little bit of alcoholic spiciness. A classic beer that sometimes gets a bad rap as if it were a macro. don't believe the hype this is a quality beer."
"Poured a wicked high head with an off-white color over a deep brown beer. The head subsided gradually with a great textured look but not a lot of lace. The aroma was a little more subtle than I expected. The aromatics I did pick up were mostly slight hints of grainy maltiness and a little bit of raisin and fruit. The flavor was dominated by a complex maltiness, with a hint of caramel and some slight fruitiness and an alcoholic warmth. Some hop bitterness was present to balance but overall this was a malty beer. Some herbaly, wood-like notes at the end of the tasting add a nice touch. Tasty and complex but I'm afraid it isn't as interesting to me as it once was. Still, a classic and delicious."
"Pours dark brown with a beautiful inch of head. Very small bubbles. Smell is clean with light fruit (plum?) aroma. Very smooth. Alcohol is evident, but not distracting. Spices and slight plum flavor. The best of the red/white/blue chimay trio. Not worth the price, but still a good (not great) ale."
"Poured with a half-inch head that subsided rapidly but stuck around with a minimal but lovely lace for the entire glass. Dark colour with lots of unfiltered goodness. Malty, pleasant aroma. Taste of dark fruits and slight alcohol, to be expected from a 9% beer. Complex, but not too much so. Tangy mouthfeel, very drinkable despite high alcohol, but the price is what would keep me from drinking more than one in a session. Lovely beer, I look forward to trying others from this brewery."
"Very drinkable for a strong dark trappist ale. Deceptively strong."
"11.2 ounce bottle, thanks poundboy."
"Notes: Now I know why a lot of people say Chimay is overrated. I must say I agree. It lacked the complexity and flavor that I was expecting. Not a bad beer by any means, but certainly not as good as advertised."
"This is a very nice beer. I will try many more Chimay products."
"I'll come back to this one, no doubt. As of right now, though, I much prefer their red label dubbel."
"I'll definitely be returning to this one."
"Drinkability: If it weren't 9% ABV, I could drink this all day long. Yet another fine beer from the Belgians."
"This is still a very complex beer. A special occasion calls for a beer like this."
"75 cl bottle, cork dated 04/03. Pours a yeasty deep chestnut color with some rust colored highlights. Greyish beige colored foam. Yeasty, dark candi sugars and malty, some ripe fruit esters, and lighter, toastier malts are all traits of the nose. Dark malty taste, with a pungent yeastiness and dark fruit notes with a light astringency in the finish that is cleansing. Higher carbonation level keeps the beer feeling airy on the tongue. I feel this is the most tasty and complex brew of the Chimay line. I'm not sure why Chimay is treated unfairly; sure they may have tweaked recipes over time, but all of their beers are still world class. I'm not a beer snob, I just like good beer... and this is good."
"Pours a brown with mahogany highlites. Nice off white head that grows and grows. The head is magnificent. Spritely carbonation rises up the chalice. Its almost a shame to drink it and spoil the picture. Aroma is of spice and a rich fruitcake doused with liquer. Taste is nice. Fruity malts up front followed by the Chimay spicyness and peppery notes. ( is it the yeast) Alcohol is there but not overwhelming. Nice and smooth mouthfeel-- full but not chewy. You would never guess it is 9%. Of all the Chimays I liked this one the best. Very drinkable. I would like another soon"
"My last Chimay it pours a dark reddish brown with nice light tan head. Aroma dark fruits, grape wine like with hints of alcohol. Taste of alcohol with a sudden burst of carbonation obscures most of flavor that is present. Malt hints of dark fruit, grape, and candy like about all I could find threw the alcohol. Mouthfeel is fine to much carbonation otherwise pretty good. Drinkability is bad could of had 2 12oz of Trois Pistoles for the price of this one 11.2 oz and they would have been more the twice as good."
"Aroma is mostly smokey, a little fruity, a little spicy. Flavor is slightly sweet, dark dried fruit (somewhere between a raisin and a prune) a little spicy (clove) with just a slight touch of bitterness on the back end."
"This is a great beer. Better than the red label Chimay. Poured a nice deep mahogany color with a good creamy head. It is loaded with flavor and very balanced. A very delicious bready/yeasty malt flavor with a just barely discernable hop character. This is a great brew. The 9.00% ABV is hardly noticeable making it very dangerous because it tastes so good."
"I've heard from alot of folks that Chimay is over-rated. I'm afraid I'm going to have to dis-agree. While not absolutely staggering, earth-shattering good, it's a very fine brew indeed, worthy of the reputation that it holds. Regretably, however, I have a little bit of a stopped up nose at the moment. As such, my sense of smell and taste are a little bit impaired. Even still, I can easily smell the yeast and spice, so typical of this style, emanting from my glass. Quite strong. A dark ruby, murky rust colour, this stuff had a nice three-quarter inch slightly off-white head on it when I poured it. Now it has subsided to little more than a frosty haze over the surface. Excellent thick, sticky lacing coats the sides of my glass, and the smell of yeast and spices is only amplified when you take a drink. The mouth feel is quite smooth and easy to drink, inspite of the carbonation level being a little bit higher than I would have anticipated. The fact that this is a 9.0%abv is well disguised. It does have a little bit of a warming sensation as it goes down, but not even close to being unpleasant or overpowering. This is my first ""baptising"" with Chimay, and now I'm even more excited about having the white and red label ones. Certainly I will have this again. Very Impressed."
"I think I'll definitely pick up one of these every so often when I'm in Lawrence."
"A very fine brew. Very tasty, without any tastes that are too over the top. Pretty smooth and subtle, I think, but impressive none the less."
" A bit on the pricey side though, not an every day beer."
"This ale is a special treat for me. Served in a 7.5dL corked/caged bottle and poured into a Duvel tulip glass with exquisite care. The appearance is fascinating, a darkly tan amber color that refracts the light into reddish hues. The head is thick and tenacious. The aroma is heaven - darkly sweet bread with raisins, plums and perhaps a hint of mango laced with molasses or brown sugar. The yeast is evident also, moreso as this delectable nectar warms to nearer room temperature. Taste is exquisite. The perfectly-balanced hops compliment the slight yeast flavor as the sweet dark fruit courses through your palate. The head traps the volitiles and lasts for the length of the glass. The taste becomes more and more complex as the ale warms. The mouthfeel is crisp and peppery for such a dark ale, in part due to the perfect carbonation. This beer is very drinkable because of the excellent taste, but you'd be inebriated after the second one."
"Overall, I like this beer the most of the Chimay brews. A great beer and very good example of an authentic belgian beer."
"Overall: Simply put, this is one of the best Belgian ales - let alone one of the best beers - in the world. It is every bit worth the $10 for a 750 ml. bottle. It's almost flawless in every way - a real treat. Highly recommended!"
"Overall, I really like this nectar of the gods- my favorite Chimay (now that I've tried them all). This did not give me the wow factor of something like the Rochefort 10, but still very good."
"Years later, this beer is passable. Dare I say its a beginner's beer? That is pretty much what it is for me."
"This is an amazing brew that I have held of on trying for far too long! This one poured a dark brown color with a very bubbely white head that settled on top of the beer. The smell was of bananna and spice and a subtle hint of mustyness as well. The taste was so fucking good with its perfect blend of bananna, clove spices and a touch of pepper flavor in the finnish. Hops are next to nothing in here but there is much flavor to this beer regardless. My bottle was dated 07/03 so after being aged a year, I'd say it tastes pretty damn good! Try this one if you have not allready and rediscover it if you have not had it in awhile!"
"Bought this in a 3-pack which included one of each Chimay variety plus a glass for around $11.00. Yesterday, I tried their Tripel and didn't really like it. I like this Blue better than the Tripel, but I can definently tell Belgian ales aren't my thing. Appearance is really dark, not quite coffee colored, but close. Head is moderate height, but quite creamy. The head never quite goes away and leaves a thin layer on top of the beer. Smell is of spices, slight apple smell. Taste is mainly of spices, reminds me of something I'd have around Christmas. Smoother than the tripel I had yesterday, but similiar. 9% alcohol is barely tasted, but noted by a warming of my stomach. Overall, I now know this isn't a style of beer for me, so I probably won't get it again."
"It opened well with a serious pop and the happy swirlly white fog. No overflow happened. It poured well. I'm drinking it with a thin wedge of Stilton which is working well. The taste is not as dominantly corky as the last bottle I had. This actually has a medium body and a very balanced taste. It's not too sweet, but yet, a little sweet. I still taste hops. This beer is nearly seven years old and it's very lively."
"The head is very dense and silky; the way it fades into a thin collar is incredibly smooth. The beer pours an opaque dark brown color with some notes of orange and purple. The smell is nicely yeasty with toasted dark malts and a light banana aroma; some hints of cream and butter too. The taste shows some fruity aspects, bananas and apples, but is mostly yeasty, with a very round and full maltiness that gives the beer a very nice bready aspect. Like cereal bread, partly melting in the mouth. A very warming alcohol feeling circles the mouth, and maybe some light nots of citrus. A very good beer, although there are some better examples of the style."
"Once again, I have no complaints about any of the beers I have tried from Chimay. This beer is delicate and still rich. The complexities of the beer take you on a beautiful voyage from sweet to musty to tangy to spicy. I'm definately on the look out for this one again."
"Carbonation tickles the tongue, bringing with it an explosion of grape/wine flavor, that barely masks the abundant alcohol. Finishes with a dry, sherry like aspect. Intriguingly complex, but not my favorite trappist."
"Notes: Very Very drinkable, with nice mouthfeel. This beer is not as outstanding as I remember from my first experience."
"Oh My God... This stuff is GOOD!!!"
"an excellent belgian beer."
"Very nice stuff, perhaps a bit too sweet for me. Not quite cloying, but almost there. I liked it much better than the tripel, but the carbonation was definitely a surprise. I like a bouyant, assertive carbonation in belgian ale, but not quite this much. The mouthfeel is still very smooth, which helps. My girlfriend thinks it's ""pretty good"". Certainly recommended by myself."
"Too hard to judge after only one, as it shows you something new each time. This beer is like a beautiful woman - she won't give up her secrets readily. I love this beer, and it's only due to the prohibitive cost that it's not a daily thing for me. As high-brow as beer gets."
"D&N: Less complex in smell and taste than the Red label, I think I'll set a few of these in the cellar to age for a bit and give this one another go. Still a very nice beer."
"This is what brewing is all about, and the trappists really know how to do it."
"The taste was very pleasing and very smooth. It starts with a sweet flavor of malt. Then you taste some spice or pepper like flavor in it mixed with a dry feeling that coats your mouth and tingles from the alcohol. As I got to the last 3-4 sips from the chalice it almost seemed like there was a different smell, maybe from the warming of the beer, that seemed to me was like rose pedals or some sort of flower. Was very nice."
"Drinkability - I don't remember what I paid for this some 2 years ago, but to look at it as many times as I did before finally opening it, I gotta say I had higher expectations. Not unfair for a highly rated beer as this. Nothing wrong with it, but I don't see myself buying it again."
"Drinkability is high, despite being 9% alcohol, I can put back a couple..."
"i gave it all fives except on the appearance, i woudl have liked to see a bigger frothy head, for a strong belgian ale. but it was still awesome"
"A very delightful strong ale but every time I've tasted it fresh and it has appeared slightly different each time. This may be a matter of ingredient linearity or it could be the brewers equivilent to a ""vintage"" where there is some batch to batch character differences. All in all, a wonderful drink but may be over rated by some."
"Drinkability: A 750 of this is just right. Good after-dinner beer."
"Maybe i got a bad batch or something, but i didn't think this beer was that good. The beer itself looked great in glass, and smelt pretty good, i could taste everything that was there (i think). I was suprised to find i couldn't really taste the alcohol much in it. It had a nice clean crisp (albiet early) finish.Maybe it's just me, but i really didn't have much to say about this beer."
"Very attractive pour - cloudy deep brown with a hint of burgundy under a 2.5 finger that showed some nice contour at first but settled to smooth creaminess a bit too quickly. I see only spots of lace on the glass. The nose is not as strong as I would like. What's there is fruity with yeast undertones and just a nip of hops astringency. The mouth is champagne prickly and fairly light - I had hoped for more body. The taste is nice, mild cranberry and cherry, with some definite fruity yeast flavors to open, followed by a reserved but noteworthy hoppy bite to finish. The aftertaste nicely combines the sweet fruit and the hoppy bitter in an impression that keeps dragging you back for more. Am I blown away by this beer? No. But it sure is very, very good."
"It's in its own class. Re-rate: Drank an old (3 year late 90's vintage) bottle that I put away. Smoother (if you can even believe it) with age. Somewhat sweet, with an incredible smoothness. Yet another re-rate. This one was bottled in 01/03. I have to agree with some of the others who have noted the decline of this beer. It is still very good, but I just can't call it exceptional anymore. Some of the subtleness and complexity has left it."
" Not my favorite Chimay, nor does it rank up there with my favorite Trappist ales. Still, for a Belgian strong dark ale, this is one of the great ones."
"Pours a very, very dark amber colour into the glass. I didn't have the right glass, but wanted to drink the beer anyway. It has a thick creamy head. The smell is fruity and spiecy. A little burned smell and smell of brown sugar. The taste is lovely, with some sweetness and not much bitterness. A little roasted taste of fudge. This is a beer that i like very much. I have tasted it from a 75cl bottle and it was even better than the 33cl bottle that i bought."
"This beer has opened my eyes to what great beer should really be like. Drinking this beer is like a religious experience (appropriately, since it is brewed by monks). Unbelievably beautiful and majestic appearance, with a thick creamy head that dissipates ever so slowly leaving an enticing lace. Constant bubbling, and an aroma that can only be described as sensuous. Tastes like nothing I have ever experienced before. Smoky, almost cognac like, it is a beer to be savored and cherished. A bit pricey ($ 12 for a 750 ml), but well worth every penny. This beer will also sneak up on you very seductively, with it's 9% ABV, and before you know it, you will be inebriated, but HAPPY. VERY HAPPY. Do yourself a favor and splurge for a bottle of this excellent beer. These monks can brew!"
"acceptably drinkable for a 9.0. This tastes very unique and...formal - like it would be appropriate whenever a bottle of wine would be. if i was blind folded, i would not know this was beer. an interesting beverage, but i can't say ""clove"" is one of my preferred flavors, and i don't forsee myself drinking this beer often."
"Served at cellar temperature, in a Chimay chalice. The cork had a date of 07/03. It poured a dark brown, with a light tan head. Aromas of clove, ginger, malt, and sugar. The tastes were maybe not as complex as, say something from Ommegang or Unibroue, but still a good representation. Ginger, clove, malt, leather, lemon, and caramel all swirled around on my happy tongue. The mouthfeel was light, with small, fizzy carbonation. It finished up with clove, caramel, and leather. Very tasty, indeed!"
"Slight lacing down the glass, an excellent beer. I don't think I can describe well enough how good this beer is, just try it."
"Overall Impression: An amazing beer. It improved as it warmed, so I suggest starting off near cellar temperatures. This has wonderful mouthfeel and a very enjoyable taste. The high alcohol rules this out for any kind of session beer, but as for drinkability, I was disappointed when the bomber was gone (and more than a little inebriated). Not a lot going on in the aroma and it’s not exactly easy on the eyes, but I’ll be stashing more of these babies away next beer hunt. I recommend you do too."
"I was a little let down by the flavor of this. Alchohol content is high and you can taste it. I think that would make it hard to drink a lot of these."
"750ml Corked bottle with 01/03 on cork. Poured a reddish brown with a creamy tan head that settled down to a thin film. Aroma is spicy and with lots of yeast present. Peppery and slightly floral. Body is smooth and creamy and with an even carbonation. The flavor is a fruity malty one with yeast and sugar notes. Overall a fine Belgian that is the most available one I can think of."
"It pours a very dark reddish brown with a thick, tannish head. Very nice lacing throughout the drink. The aroma is malty with definite fruity undertones. The taste is exceptional even for a Trappist ale. It starts with a sweet maltiness that has real grapey undertones. The taste ends with an alcohol hit that is ameliorated by the fruitiness. One of the few beers that I rate a 5 in taste. It feels almost perfect in the mouth with some real body, nice carbonation, and a lingering taste of fruit. I rate this down a little in drinkability just because of the alcohol content. It is drinkable from first drop to last, but one, even splitting one, is enough to affect the motor skills."
"Pours a deep reddish brown with only minimal traces of light through the glass around the edges. The head fills the glass and ""fizzes"" away slowly without much lacing. Smell is sweet--ripe plums. Taste is sweet with plums and dark grapes mingled with a hint of alcohol for a nice warming effect with each sip. The mouthfeel is full is body and there is a nice crispness with each sip from the fine carbonation. Drinkability is okay, but the high ABV certainly creeps up on you quickly. I keep getting outstanding 750mls of this, always good quality, and never a bad bottle."
"Poured from a 750 ml bottle. Dark brown with loads of floating yeast. Beautiful appearance. Big bubbly off white head that left rings of lace. The smell was very musty and yeasty. Also quite fruity. The taste was less sweet than I expected considering some of the other strong dark ales I've sampled, but that's not disappointing in the least. Dried raisons and plums and wild musty yeast flavors filled my mouth and nose, followed by a generous amount of warming alcohol. Quite pleasing. Mouthfeel was very creamy and thick, also quite carbonated and filling. Drinkability was hampered by the richness, although I still say it's good considering I'm almost done with the 750 as I write this. An amazing offering from one of the big 6 true Trappist Abby's. I suggest you try it if you can."
"Oddly enough, the taste changed with additional sips, which was nice - it invited you to keep experiencing the beer...sort of like reheating left over italian foods."
"From a 750ml bottle, into the Chimay goblet. The beer is brown, darker than you'd expect. Sweety smell of fruits and dissimulated alcohol. The taste is yeasty, sweet (toffee?) and malty, pretty complex and very enjoyable in mouth. You don't taste alcohol so much, you just enjoy the brew. Great beer if not a top belgian nor what it used to be."
"My favorite among the Chimay offerings. Theres always room for a Grand Reserve or two in the beer fridge."
"Drinkability: Pleasant overall, certainly a well-made beer, but I like the other, more obscure, Trappist beers out there. A good intro to the style, though, and readily available."
"The beer pours a deep dark brown color with a thick off-white head. The aroma is good. It has a rich Belgian style scent with a number of crystal malts and fruity yeast. The taste is great. It is full of malts and Belgian spice. It has a raisin/ molasses taste that is excellent. The mouthfeel is good. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a fine drinking Belgian style. It's dark and robust, but damn good; a real good beer."
"It's a long-time standard, and justifiably so. The flavor and aroma are full and balanced enough to really grab and hold your attention, but not so busy as to lose its identity at any point. This is one of my wife's favorites, and it always puts a smile on her face when I bring it home. In spite of the strong ABV, it's drinkable because you just have to taste it again. There's nothing like a pair of worn slippers, a loyal dog, or a trusty Chimay Blue."
"I'll definitely try this again, along with the other Chimay brews. It's perfect for a rainy winter evening, like tonight."
"Remarkably, this beer feels at home on a night before the fire or a spring afternoon; with a strong cheese or by itself; one or several. You'll find better ""seasonal"" beers, made specially for Xmas or for a hot summer day, but there is no better all-around beer than the Grande Reserve."
"Poured dark with chocolate highlights - virtually opaque in the glass - with a creamy, small to moderate light tan head. The aroma was of sweet, roasted malt. The carbonation gave the mouthfeel almost soda pop-like resemblances, and it seemed to leave a coating on the palate that lingered after swallowing. The flavor was sweet and yeasty, with sort of a toasted highlight. It's a pretty beer and everything was good, but it didn't leave me wanting another one immediately, so it lost a few points in the drinkability department."
"The Grand Reserve poured a fine opaque brown with a 1/2 a finger of tan head that dissipated to a nice lace. The smell was of malt, yeast, and alcohol. The taste was a fizzy alcohol with a nice shot of yeast and malt in the finish. It's feel was smooth and foamy with some iron in the aftertaste. Initially it seemed as it might be a good session beer, but the carbonation was just too much. A good beer to finish the night off after a good meal."
" easily the best beer ive ever had (yet). everything about it is just done right, not too much not too little. more please???"
"Drinkability - not worth the price, but a good brew. Would buy more if it were half the cost."
"Well, I've had all three of the Chimay brews I've seen and none, including the Grand Reserve, have shown me anything to make me get all excited over them. This beer definitely gets better as it nears room temp but never quite reaches the mark for me. Maybe it should have sat in my cellar longer. Somehow, I don't think that would have helped all that much. Overrated, over-hyped, and over-priced, this flagship offering from Chimay doesn't meet the standard set by St. Bernardus' Abt 12 or Rochefort 10."
"Spoils of the 10/11/03 Knoxville Raid."
"I think I like to wilder taste of the Chimay red a bit more but this is good."
"I loved this beer, I knocked off .5 from the drinkability only due to the ABV."
"Comes in a beautiful blue 1.75 pint corked bottle. Explodes slightly upon opening, much to my surprise, haha. Pours a brown red, with a good white-yellow head. Smells hearty, of alcohol and hops. Taste is bold and complex, and I think I can even taste alcohol flavor. Malty and carbonated, this brew has a sweet smell like honey, butter and caramel. Very drinkable, hides it's high alcohol content well. An excellent beer, perhaps I will try cellaring it in the future."
"The Chimay Blue poured a murky, cloudy, caramel brown color. It had a big off-white head that had great retention. It had a rather subtle aroma...yeasty and winey with some oak and a faint fig smell. It had a complex taste that is pretty difficult to describe. A kind of tart, figgy taste up front with some oak and winey tones and a slighty spiced finish. It was a nicely balanced, smooth beer. A great beer for special occasions."
"Three years later and it is a fine drink,yeasty aroma, with brandy-like richness that is popular and went well again with food. Fine trappist."
"It almost put me to sleep. Boring. All of above is the same, it just didn't impress me as much."
"Nice."
"I like this brew alot and will surely try more. At 9% it's pretty strong but that never really holds me back from having a few. I urge you to try a bottle if you like Belgian ales."
"Good Brew, definietly woth the price, and I intend to get some more of this."
"Wow, I don't think I would be a complete beer drinker without trying this stuff. I really hope I can find a few bottles in the states to cellar."
"Drinkability: Deceptively drinkable high ABV brew. Crack this open as an alternate to champagne for your next celebration. The fuss over this beer is well founded."
"Sampled 11/20/03"
"I haven't had Chimay 'blue' in a while, and I kind of forgot how it was until last night. I had a 750ml bottle and it made me smile. It's a dark brown colour with a nice kind of big head that only slowly disappears. It smells strong like a strong Belgian should, sweet and fruity almost. It has that sour-ish fruity flavor, mixed with some sugary sweetness and it doesn't taste too boozy and isn't thick, so the drinkability is very good. You can forget yourself. It's not my favourite Belgian but it's definitely a good one. :)"
"A little over-the-top to be a regular brew, but very nice to sip on in the colder months."
"Bottled 02/03 Appearance: Deep murky brown Mohogany with a silky creamy tan head nice and thick lacing just as thick on the sides very nice. Aroma: Vinous grapes, raisin, bread dough, and dark roasts create mild chocolate tones. Effervescent fruit is the backbone of the aroma. Taste: Once again flavor has a wine like air about it with doughy mild sweet bread, raisiny sweet tones, and decadent grape profile nice. Mouthfeel: Fluffy medium body spritzy but smooth carbonation. Drinkability: Is excellent a masterpiece can't tell it's 9% abv."
"Pourred a very dark brew with a huge withe fluffy head and small bubble coming on top. This one has less of the sweeter taste then the red and more roastiness. This beer also has a firm body and the alcohol taste is not too distinct. The spice are very complex. This one is also a classic and never can get enough of."
"Overall an enjoyable ale, if not a little unbalanced. A little too much sugary sweetness at times. Otherwise very good. Just feels like it needs a little more time. Will try aging the next one."
"Finishing off the first 16 or so ounces, I am grinning happily, because I've only made it less than half-way through the bottle!"
"A fabulous drinking experience. Worth every penny."
"After a few minutes of residuals lingering in the palette, I knew why this beer is so revered: it simpy an outstanding abbey beer, from one of the world's finest, with an abundance of beautiful flavors through and through."
"Feel is medium bodied with a weird texture I just couldn't get past. Where's the smooth? Where's the creamy? Blah, boring, yuk. Not impressed. The Chimay Red was much better. I'm not sure if I have a bad bottle or what, but I've been saving this bottle, plus a few others for nearly 4 months hoping a bit of aging would make for an interesting session, but nope. I guess I'll be letting those sit alot longer. I'm bored, can I have my Unibroue Trois Pistoles now?"
"Chimay is sweet and fruity with a deep amber color with red highlights. Hints of exotic spices and some fruits, perhaps raisins, permeate the taste. When poured into a glass Chimay forms a full tan head that dissipates slightly but never vanishes. Truly an excellent beer which grows more and more complex as it reaches room temperature."
"Served in a tulip glass. Dark chestnut color with ruby highlights coming out where the light gets through. Topped with a big, fat, chunky, foamy beige head that just hangs there and settles down, but never really goes away. Aroma is strong fruit and yeast. Flavor is rich and velvety. The flavor almost has texture. It's sweet and fruity and spicy and warm. There's lots here - honey and pear, plus some apple and butterscotch and caramel and plum. You notice more every time you sip. Mouthfeel is creamy and smooth. A pleasant hop bitter lingers, as does just a hint of alcohol. A pleasure."
"Pours a dark cloudy ruby brown, with a large tan head that mostly lasts and laces in sheets. Aroma is fruity (raisin, plum), some yeastiness, sweetness, and a bit of caramel and/or toffee. Flavor is sweet, fruity, vinous, some honey, and some spiciness in the finish. Full bodied, slight hints of alcohol towards the end."
"Poured a dark brownish-black with a light tan head. There were brown and ruby highlights when held to strong light. I could make out orange and citrus notes, rum and dark fruits, and bready notes in the aroma. The smell was deceiving, as the tastes was very smooth, almost creamy. Everything blended very well together, and all I could make out were notes of alcohol and biscuity malts. A bit overwhelming. This was part 3 of a 3 part vertical Chimay tasting. All in all, I found all three were truly good beers, but overhyped by others. Because of that, I don't think I enjoyed any of them as much as I had hoped, and none lived up to their expectations"
"With the dark brown reddish color and the controlled but strong head, this beer was beautiful. Taste was full and interesting. I didn't get some of the nuances one can sometimes get from these sorts of beers. Instead it was a very tasty balanced interesting beer."
"I was surpised to realize that I had not yet rated this third member of the Chimay trio. This is a well crafted, quality beer - no doubt. I have to wonder, though, it its wide availabiltiy and name recognition don't sometimes earn it a bit more acclaim than it deserves. Pours a nice cola-colored amber. Very lively carbonation. Not a great deal of aroma. The flavor is very clean and well balanced, but without the depth Belgian darks are capable of. Rum-soaked dark bread flavors - alcohol is proudly displayed but well integrated in the flavor. Finish is nicely clean and dry."
"I love trappist beers but their expense, especially here in Oz makes them a rare treat indeed..."
"pours out a dark brown, slightly cloudy colour. short lived head and no lace. light musty, berry aroma...very inviting. tastes extremely awesome...vine ripened fruits...yeasty notes adding complexity...berry complexities are amazing. mouthfeel slightly lively...carbonation adding zest...an explosion of malt and yeast adding flavours beyond my comprehension. smooth and silky mouthfeel...regardless of my ability to soak up the 9% ABV...a great beer. highly regarded and highly recommended."
"I can see this being an ideal ale to sip at on a chilly winter's night in front of a fire, or an equally appealing distraction. It warms the bones from the inside and gives you a feeling of contentment. But that just might be the 9% abv talking."
"It is a brew for a special occasion that I rate rate as a 9.3 in my 1-10 scale but is fairly pricey as it comes in about 2.5 on my value factor. It is a pretty sophisticated brew that would not necessarily be the choice for a first timer to try a Belgian brew."
"Pours a fairly clear, deep ruby-amber-brown color. It is topped by a tan head and is pretty well carbonated. The aroma is fruity and musty, with notes of prunes, alcohol, and raisins. The taste is sweet up front, with a rich malty center that moves to a fizzy rich finish. This is actually quite a bit better than I was expecting it to be. It is fairly light on the palate, especially given its strength, but it does have a slightly lingering rich malt note to it. It is pretty fruity with concentrated notes of raisin and fig, as well as some spicy yeast notes that hint at ginger, cardamom, and clove. The finish of this one reminds me some of sweet apple cider, it has a certain sharp, almost acidic fruity finish to it that is pretty interesting."
"Pours a deep amber color with a nice beige head that leaves a gentle lacing on the glass. The beer has wonderful smells, fruit, malt, earthy smells, all of them wonderful, the smell reminds me more of a wine than a beer. It is very smooth and very flavorful, very complex. One taste you taste the fruits, the next you taste the malts, all of these blends wonderfully. A new bottle leaves a slight twinge on the tongue from the alcohol, but the bottle I am reviewing is one I have been aging for 1 1/2 yrs, and let me say, it ages quite well, the overall flavors blend more, and the alcohol balances out and isnt overwhelming. It becomes very very smooth. Aged or new, you cannot go wrong with this beer."
"This unusual Trappist pours a deep mahogany with a frothy, foamy beige head and loads of clingy lace. The aroma is yeast, malty, hoppy with citrus and fruity notes. The body is heavy and a bit sweet and a little sour. Cloves, hops, over-ripe bananas and alcohol are in your face. A bit of spicy tastes lingers. This brew is really strong in most everyway. Well made, but lacking in harmony or balance."
"John"
"This beer poured a nice brownish color with a medium sized tan head. It had a very complex flavor with a fruity malty smell with a nice touch of spices. Very smooth beer to drink even for the high content of alcohol. This is a beer that I could drink all the time and be happy with it. I would have to say this is one great beer. I have sampled this beer in both the small and large bottles. The larger bottle has a little better taste but either selection should make you a happy camper."
"Poured a cloudy brown mahogany with a creamy tan head. Aroma is malty, fruity, and there is a touch of tobacco. Taste is not as fruity as other Belgians I've had (the plummy flavor is missing.) Far more malty, and rather spicy. This is one complex beer, and I'm sure my inexperienced taste buds are missing out on a great deal. Fairly smooth drinking. Drinkability suffers because of the somewhat high price and abv."
"This beer pours a dark brown color with a large head and some lacing on the glass. The aroma is spicy and fruity, but not too strong. The flavor was very spicy and complex. The malts were are the most flavorfull thing with the spices coming in close second. I really liked this beer because of the complexity of the taste, but it was so spicy that it gave me some immense heart burn. Good beer."
"Beer poured a brownish dark color, topped off by a surprisingly small head. The aroma was somewhat faint, I thought it would be a lttle more hoppy. I got a quick taste of what I would normally associate with amber beers, with just a touch of sweetness, that dissapated smoothly and with no harshness. Pleasant enough if your buddy is buying, a lttle too pricey for what you get"
"Deep brown color, large head. Deeply malty and hoppy. Complex taste, blend of malts, spiciness (nutmeg, peppers, sandalwood) Nice flavor. Smooth and mellow. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean. Aftertaste has a definite alcohol bite (9%) and is rather dry. Taste mellows as you drink."
"Update: The 2004 vintage is more of the same. I havent been able to get a consistant 5 head over time so Im dropping this rating to a 4.5."
"A superb beer. This was the first Chimay I'd ever had, and still my favorite. Pours a murky, almost mud-like brown, with a head to match. Probably the darkest head I've ever seen on a beer. High level of carbonation. Smels of fruit, both sweet and dark. Tastes wonderfully complex, with dark fruity toasted malt, a sweet apple-like fruit and a crisp finish huddled together in one bottle. To think one buys this in the same area of a store that Budweiser is sold in!"
"Pours out a raisiny brown with a small carbonated head. Smell is malty, with some yeast and bread overtones. Body was surprisingly undeveloped; I didn't get the distinguishable flavors I expected (like Rochefort 10 or St Bernardus 12). I had two bottles; I'm going to lay the other one down for a while. This was good, but for the hype and the price I was expecting ""wow"". I'll stick to the St Bernardus 12 until this baby ages a while.."
"I'm not sure as to how aged this bottle of Chimay was but I must say it had a different taste then expected. When poured I expected it to be a much stronger taste but it is not so. The taste is actually much more refinined then I am used to with a wonderful smell and texture. This is one that I intend on drinking again whenever the opportunity presents itself."
"This beer poured a burgandy color with an unbalanced, airy head that did not look too appealing. The aroma was pleasant with notes of Belgian yeast, plums and bread. The taste had some very unmature flavors to it. Raisins, caramel, oats, alcohol spicyness and yeast were what I experienced. This beer seems like it needs to be aged so the flavors can come out more. This could be phenomonal if aged well, but it's just good right now. At $14/750ml bottle good is not good enough."
"Great beer, one of the best examples of a belgian dark ale."
"This is very good. Better than the White for me, but I'm not sure it's better than the red for me."
"Warmer still and crazy XO cognac sensations become noticeable. Hennessy Paradis tastes a little bit like this...all candied orange peel and spicy, essential chocolate. What a beauty."
"Slightly hazy, a few shades short of black at its darkest, ruby around the edges light brown head, reached a fingers worth but faded quicker than it should, slim, wispy residue disappointing amount of lace (almost none). Limited nose thats short on depth and lacks potency: alcohol and rich maltiness surpasses the plums, apples and candy aromas. Still its inviting. Tasty palate with a fair amount of depth, excellent balance as well. The flavor profile is richly malty, plums and apples too, yeasty bready, caramelized candy-sugar, spiciness of figs, clove, and pepper. The alcohol is hidden on the tongue. The finish is tart and heavy on the carbonation pretty nice but its too abrupt and only the pepper remains on the aftertaste. Disappointing its hard to savory a beer that disappears from your tongue so quickly. Medium light body spritzy carbonation. The high abv is noticeable on your mind. Chimay Blue lacks a certain complexity needed to be truly outstanding. If I have this one again, Id go with the smaller capped bottle and not the corked rendition. I think this beer is highly overrated try one if you must. Yawn..."
"Overall, this is a fine beer. I'd give it a year or two to mellow, but otherwise it's wonderful."
"This is easily the best beer that Chimay produces. I was lucky enough to get mine for $10, but I would pay twice that for something of this quality. Every bit as good as any fine wine!"
"Reviewed from a 750ml, cork said 3/03 on it, bottle and pours a dark chestnut with white head that sticks around for a few minutes but fizzles out to a slight lace, being a high alcohol brew was quite amazing, albeit I wasnt drinking out of the proper glassware though. The smell was of dark malt and was not astringent in any way compared to the beers overall darkness. Tasted exceptional with a thorough maltiness and subdued hops that kept it in a somewhat balance but the malt is the predominant flavor with alcohol not being apparent at all within this elixir. All together a very drinkable beer that I find to be rewarding experience each every time I drink. Only problem I find with this beer is that it is much to drinkable given its high abv."
"This is one rich looking beer,a masterpiece to look at.Pours a nice amber/brown with with a slight of white frothy head that of course left some beautiful lacing.The aroma was malty sweet of dried fruit.The taste to me was wine-like with a raisiny quality,there is some slight bitterness in the finish.A very complex beer but not easy to drink for me,but a classic for sure."
"On this tasting, a pretty nice drink, but didn't blow me away."
"Ultimately, it tastes damn good and I can't think of a better recommendation than that."
"This was an absolute treat -- and something of a surprise. I didn't know this bottle was going to be ten years old. But I'm sure as hell glad it was!!! Great experience."
"Dark brown, with slight off white head. Gentle aroma of dark bread. Bready moderately hoppy long laswting sweet flavor. Heavy mouth feel with restrained bubbles. This was not an amazing beer and I was quite underwhelmed by this beer. Perhaps this focuses on finess as opposed to intensity."
"Originally sampled on 8 June 2002. Chimay Blue pours a large, dirty white colored head w/ an amber body. It has a nice smooth taste. It's alcohol level sneaks up on you. In my area, this beer is quite easily found, I'd suggest this to be the first belgian for any beer novice looking to experience a world class beer."
"I had this brew in an 11.2oz. bottle poured into a Leffe Chalice glass. The color is a deep brown, speckled with yeast. There is about 1 finger of head that has a pretty good retention, leaving a bit of lace on the glass. The aroma is very spicy, mostly cloves. The taste has a pretty good spicy bite to it, but it could use a little bit more hops. The finish seems to be a little weak. The mouthfeel is only average and the drinkability is not too high. Not too bad overall."
"A well-crafted brew. This isn't an amazing beer, as there are better examples of the style, especially for the price. For a few bucks cheaper, Unibroue's Trois Pistoles is just as good. However, this is my favorite Chimay out of the three. What is interesting is that after having had these three beers (the red, white, and blue), I have a very high index of suspicion that Unibroue uses this exact same yeast strain. The similarities are uncanny."
"Truly one of the greatest beers in the world. A brilliant brew and a must experience for any fan of fine beverages."
"pat"
"What a wonderful creation to be called beer. This really raises the bar of beer excellence into the complex levels of fine wines. The murky liquid poured out into the glass like a rich molasses with less fullness. After several attempts at identifying the huge aroma that wafted freely from the glass I finally concluded that it is mostly like a prune smell - full and rich and wholesome. The flavors, of course, are quite complex and balanced. In attempting to grasp the predominant flavor, I bounced a sip on the front of my tongue for several seconds. The affect was simply amazing. There was an enormous sense of hot pepperiness. Not unpleasant, in fact, quite the opposite. There was an element of dried fruit in the taste along with almond oil, nuts, and roasted grain. Astonishing."
"Just an incredible beer. If this beer were readily available, I'd have a home stock at all times, but, unfortunely, wouldn't value this beer as much. Let me say it one last time, an incredible beer."
"Pours a very dark amber, with a thick, creamy tan head. Smell is very complex, with distinct fruit flavors coming foward. Taste is simply incredible. A bit malty and a bit spicy, and again the fruit flavors dominate. A supreme Trappist ale, and highly recommended."
"One 750ml bottle should be enough for anyone. anymore then that is over doing it. I could drink this pretty regularly, but not in quanity."
"overall great drinkability a very intrigueing beer, draws one into it's own world of sensation..a very good ""sipper"""
"11.2 ounce stubby brown bottle. It's very murky dark brown, and a huge off-white head fluffs about. There's a very yeasty aroma immediately, and then some dark fruits and malts. Medium bodied smoothness is a pleasant greeting. Carbonation is perfect. Caramel maltiness, yeast, and dark fruits all treat the palate like a king. 9% ABV isn't noticeable at all. This beer kicks ass. So enjoyably smooth and tasty."
"This beer is characterised by a nice head with small bubbles and some medium sized ones. The head is long lasting and has a nice tan color. The aroma is non-offensive and mild. It's color is a dark non-transparent brown with some particles suspended. The flavor is mellow and very much top my liking. it is not overly strong though and does not have that immediated feeling that other strong beers can give. All in all one of the better beers I have rated. GF gave is an alright rating. I later rerated this brew. I had an extremely upset stomach after trying this beer. I had noted previously that there were others who experienced this problem. Hence, my rating was lowered."
" Now I understand things a little bit better. This beer's nose alone kept me satisfied. The first taste brings up memories of tastes throughout my entire life. Strong tastes that left some sort of memorial behind. There are hints of citrus, and berries, and apples, and all sorts of stuff. The alcohol comes through only in feeling, not taste. The beer is incredibly strong, in all senses of the word. Pinnacle."
"A really interesting color--much like fresh-pressed apple cider. Dark and somewhat cloudy with a minimal, soda-like head. Nose's pirincipal character is its full, malty sweetness with a bit of alcohol detectable. Taste is wonderfully full, starting malty sweet and warming up quite markedly. Crisply carbonated in the middle, and drying as the alcohol warmth takes over. A pleasant, clean mouthfeel and a substantial beer I could wrap an evening around."
"As time has passed, and I have grown to appreciate beers like Rochefort and Westleverten, I have not enjoyed Chimay as much. It's still an excellent beer, but somewhat thin and carbonated compared to a few of the great dark Belgian ales that I now prefer. I can now understand why many people are less impressed with Chimay these days. Excellent, yes, but there are better beers to be had."
"Clear, dark walnut color with a big, rocky stable head. This beer is really attractive, with a decent estery, peppery aroma. To be honest, the aroma could be a little more intense, but there's a lot of wonderful smells in there....dark, meaty fruit and spice...clove. Full, rich, and slightly dry....medium body. Despite the strength of the beer, the 9% stays firmly in the background, making this a very drinable beer. Not the best Belgian around, but solidy good."
"Comments: Theres a lot happening here. Very complex and enjoyable. Ive had this a number of times and will continue to do so."
"2001 Reserve - 3 litre Magnum. My firend had this one - or rather we all shared in it as his 200th beer at the Flying Saucer. That bigger bottle does make a difference. The beer has more body and a smoother flavor. Plus this is just a gigantic frgiign' beer!"
"Now….It poured into the glass a rich Corinthian leather brown that was crystal clear and well carbonated. The head was rich and full. Creamy tan in color that had great staying power that left behind a beautiful delicate lace. The aroma first reminded me of champagne, fruity and bubbly, but the aromas of dark malt, wood, apples (like an apple barrel), spices and alcohol soon came forward. Then the taste. My tongue was alive. Flavors of a rich dark malt, apples, wood (again like it came from a wooden apple barrel) light spices to accompany the apples and the boom of the alcohol weaved itself all through the other flavors. A warming alcohol glow was left after you sip this beer. Very good beer three times over. Very satisfying and pleasing. So many words can describe the feelings after drinking this, but I will refrain and steer you back to the first line where this review started."
"Well. A high rated beer, but not for me. It has a bit too much alcohol finish for me, and it has an aroma and flavor like most strong belgian ales, but it also has a bad aroma and flavor of ""old, wet laundry", that I don't like. The yeast overpowers, as is typical for these types..."
"Mmmm. I had a 750 of 1986 Chimay Blue at the Kulminator a week or two ago that was simply out of this world. Vinous as all hell and as complex as anything else out there. This one REALLY improve with age!"
"I really enjoyed the experience associated with this beer. Monks 3,500 miles from where I sit crafted this beer; now I, sitting in my apartment on a cold evening, can enjoy the fruits of their labor. If the leaders of the world sat down and enjoyed a good beer together, lovingly crafted as was this one, I think we might finally achieve at least a few precious moments of total peace and harmony. Thank you, Beer Advocate, for providing a venue for my real beer education. Without this site, I'd still be drinking Bass and thinking that I was truly experiencing a good beer."
"Even though I have had hundreds of fine beers - some more impressive than this - since my first taste of Chimay, this one always seems to impress me."
"07/02 was the date on the cork. Pours a dark brown and give a thick head that stayed around for a spell. It left a thin lace to the end. A sweet aroma hits your nose, mostly malt but a hint of fruit and yeast. The taste is not as rich and creamy as the Red but it is enjoyable. It has a noticeable taste of alcohol, and a hint of the fruit and yeast. Another enjoyable beer."
"The smell is slightly sweet/spice/yeasty aroma. The flavor is not as complex I I would have liked. More alcoholic and carbonated, but the spice/yeast/sweet flavors try and get through. OK mouthfeel. Overall, I will not buy this again. The next time I feel like a belgian beer I will go with the Hennepin."
"Wow, this is a nice ale. The bottle reminded me a little of the Duvel bottle, small and with a funny top. :) It looks like Coca-Cola on the color, is that good or bad? :D The head is brown and a bit hard to tame, almost like on a Duvel too! It smells alot...like burnt sugar I think..very nice smell. The taste is very rich, it tastes a bit like the smell, burnt sugar, and subtle touch of toffee to top it off. Whopping in at 9% abv you better be careful with this baby. :)) Should be served at 14°C."
"Joyfully explosive ""pop"" of the cork and dark sedimentary red pour invites to a highly drinkable well balanced beer with a steadfast head smelling of fruit and wood, tasting of cherry and ceder with a dry earthy finish. The alcohol in this beer perfoms a masterful dance with the flavor and fragrance of it all. Made for many, but contains something special just for you."
"An easy drinker despite the relatively high alcohol. Very creamy and mouth filling. Not an everyday brew but one that I will return to over and over again."
"Drinkability: Good. The subtle flavor grows on you."
"I'm not yet sure if this was worth 10 dollars a bottle yet, but it is definitely the best of it's style that I've had to date. Pours a massive head that reduces to lace in about a minute. It's got a very dark appearance for a medium bodied beer. The aroma is very sweet and complex, with a strong yeast presence. Same goes for the taste. It's also got some ripe bananna and apple flavors with a slightly bitter aftertaste. It's a bit harsh due to the high carbonation and ABV, but after a glass or two of this, you'll be too buzzed to notice, not that I condone using this beer as a means of getting drunk (unless you can afford to. I sure as hell can't). Anyway, after drinking more of this throughout the process of writing this review, I would have to reccomend at least trying it. It's certainly a damn good Belgian."
"Pours the color of strong iced tea. Thick, dense, tan foamy head that lasts for quite a few minutes and eventually fades to a 1/8 inch layer. Roasted malts dominate the nose with spruce undertones. Great mouthfeel. Feels heavier in the mouth than it looks. Nice alcohol warmth. Smooth hop bitterness plays around in the back of my mouth. Really great balance. Caramels & mollasses too. Well carbonated and creamy."
"After this young grasshopper has traveled the beer world, I have learned much. This excellent beer deserves a better rating."
"Dark brown in color with a finger-thick, off-white foamy head, which quickly settles into a nice creamy top. Aroma is fruity and spicy, with evident alcohol notes. Flavor is malty sweet with a creamy body -- quite luxurious. Malt takes on a slightly roasted flavor mid-palate, where it is complemented by a variety of spicy notes, a slight apple-like tartness, and the warming sensation of alcohol. Finish is just hopped enough for balance, and is slightly smoky in flavor. Aftertaste is a bit sour. Reading back on this review, those descriptors (smoky, sour, apple-like, roasty) don't seem to go well together, but it is the wonder of Chimay that it manages to pull it off with style. A classic Trappist ale and well worth buying a number of -- some for now, and some to cellar for later!"
"Now that I have sampled all three Chimay beers I think that I like the Red the best, followed closely by the Blue. All three are very good, I am just a bit partial to the Red. The Blue was still a good pick for my 100th reveiw though."
"the yeast is noticeable in the flavor, but it is under control. you get a nice rich beer with flavors of delicious malts and a constant hint of caramel. smooth as you could imagine out of the 750ml. it is a truly great trappist."
"Fruit/yeast/roast nose. Plum color with a tan head. Lots of tiny bubbles in the goblet. Tart taste of raisin with hints of cherry and smoke. Lively mouth with a crisp finish. Very clean and drinkable for a darker belgian. The mouth smooths as the brew warms in the goblet. At 9% it does the trick. Smooth yet crisp this is a great selection with food during the fall months."
"This beer poured a very dark amber color and formed a bubbly off white head that left trace lace. It had an aroma of malt, currents/plums and citrus. The flavor was of malt, caramel and cirtrus. The body has a nice slightly creamy aspect to it and the finish just hints at the alcohol and a slight carbonation feel to it. This by far the best of the Chimays and worthy of it's title Grand Reserve. Thanks again to the state to letting us Ohioians finally try this Belgium find."
"Ah that lovely site of a Chimay Bleu, breathing away in my Chimay Chalice, deep opalescent garnet to brown in color, the head majestic in its presence, the lace perfectly clinging to glass. What a nose, would make Jimmy Durante proud, large in malt, sweet, hints of caramel and yes, maybe yeast, down right sniffable. Begins malt sweet, the top middling in feel, the finish beautifully hopped, majestically carbonated and the aftertaste as dry as the Arizona Desert. I know many think this beer overrated, well Bucko, I like it, and it is my Most favorite Chimay!"
"This dark brown ale has amber highlights and pours with a beautiful head that appears to have two distinct layers. The lower 2/3 of the head has a medium density bubble, while the upper 1/3 has a very fine bubble density and looks very creamy. The head retention on this beer is fantastic, and it leaves an enticing lace. The aroma has a maltiness to it, but also exhibits many earthy tones, as well as a hint of orange peel. The flavor is simply an explosion of taste. Definite citus notes, very heavy on the orange peel, but followed by caramel sweetness. The alcohol is noticeable. There also seems ot be a spiciness to the beer, with pepper and maybe a hint of coriander in the finish. There is so much going on it is hard to isolate the flavors, which blend together into a beautiful kaleidoscope of taste. The mouthfeel is superb, with a slightly thick feel, yet not overpowering. I wouldn't mind drinking this beer regularly, but couldn't have many in one sitting. Having tried this, I now know what many American interpretations of the Belgian Strong Ale style are attempting to present. Where many fall short, this beer comes up big. Obviously a classic that I should have enjoyed sooner."
"Pours into the Chimay goblet a deep, dark wood-stain amber crowned with a large white Belgian head, which stays beautifully like a blanket of snow. Wonderfully complex and immense aroma of freshly cut oranges with a little banana and other subtle fruit, possibly strawberry, along with some spicy dried fruit and a hint of pepper. What a flavor! First, sweet caramel with a spicy outer shell rolls in. The next wave hits in the middle of the palate, pepper rides in on the edges of fresh fruit, tangy orange, sweet banana, and berries. Alcohol warms the mouth near the end, and is noticeable in the aftertaste and with retro-olfaction. Caramel malt is again present in the finish. Due to the malty backbone, the mouthfeel isn't totally dominated by carbonation as it can sometimes be in other Belgian-style beers. However, that big backbone also makes it slightly less drinkable. The keyword there is ""slightly"". I'd like to stress that this is a true masterpiece of a beer that does not need high drinkability for enjoyment, especially since you'd only want to drink one or two of these at a time due to the high alcohol content. Not that you won't be thirsty for more of this mouth-watering elixir. I'd love to have some Chimay cheese to pair with this. I picked this up today in a gift pack containing this and the other two widely known Chimay offerings as well as the signature chalice for only $10.99. Great deal, considering how much the singles cost, it's like getting the glass for free."
"Pours a rich deep brown with a cream-colored head that dissipated much quicker than I expected but did a nice job of clinging to the sides of the glass while drinking.  The aroma is dominated by yeast with hints of fresh fruit and flowers.  The flavor is a combination of roasted malt and dried fruit.  As the beer warmed, it seemed to take on more of a woody/earthy flavor.  Very nice.  For a 9% brew, it is deceivingly smooth in the mouth.  It would be quite easy to have a few too many of these, if not for the steep price of $7.99 for a 750ml, that is."
"Me, I like a bit of edge."
"Though, I must say that this is my favorite Chimay offering."
"I was really surprised by this beer. It's probably one of very few of the style that I'd actually buy on a regular basis."
"2001 version. I have been looking forward to trying this one for quite awhile (thanks to a trade with an Aussie gent!). Definitely worth the wait. Chimay Red is a real letdown compared to this. This isn't the best beer I have ever had but it is definitely up there. I only wish I had a fancy goblet to drink these Belgian ales in. Healthy, lively head over an earthy dark brown beer. Fruit, caramel and toffee in the aroma. As with the Westy, the flavor seemed to morph as I drank it, something like liquid Grape Nuts. The flavor came out more and more as it warmed, so the beer got even better as I drank it. A true classic."
"Now here's a good tasting beer....brown in color with a white creamy head...nose is of malt and dark fruits...very creamy and smooth in the mouth...9%??  Hard to believe...don't really taste the alcohol...the taste is very good...I get the expected dark candy sugar taste pretty strong..also some dark fruits...sweet maltiness...even some soft almonds...a real treat...Give me the blue Chimay over the white Chimay any day..."
"Highly Recommended, and best after 2-3 years in my experience."
"Chimay pours a dark brown liquid with a fluffy off-white head that clings to the glass. Smell is quite sweet and malty. The first sip reveals a huge fig character, followed by candy sugar and ending on a note of vanilla bean. Very interesting. Possesses a lightly carbonated mouthfeel and seems to be a touch thin. For an ale of 9% ABV, I can hardly notice the alcohol. A very unique offering, indeed."
"Cork date reads July 2001.  Pours opaque brown, with a thick cream colored head that settled to a very persistant 1/4 inch lace.  Aroma of yeast, cherries, and oak.  Flavor begins sweet with  malt, and fig.  Becomes slightly bitter in the middle, and finishes with a vanilla flavor and noticable alcohol.  Body is thin for the style, and carbonation is quite high.  This is a wonderful sipping beer, and is quite complex and flavorful.  It's very distinct, and a bit of a surprise... not what I expected in a Belgian Dark... but a very enjoyable beer for #100."
"Cork Date:  August 2001.  Pours a very dark tea color that is slightly hazy.  Produced a three finger head that is slightly off-white with staying power.  The smell was very faint with the only detectable aroma being a slightly sweet yeasty smell.  The taste was definitely remnant of old as it had a musty book smell type taste with raisins and yeast.  Very well balanced and the higher alcohol was not even noticeable by taste.  Bless the monks!  Op uw gezonheid!"
"Exceptional!"
"12/01 on cork. Great inviting copper color, medium head with little lace. Complex aromas lost from my pounder (won't make that mistake again). A unquie malty taste but 9% is well hidden. A pleasant aftertaste that seems to stay. A top of the line belgium."
"You can think about cellaring this but it tastes too good to wait.  Drunk slowly the high ABV won't hit you and the alcohol is not noticeable.  High carbonation and serious head that takes a while to dissipate."
"This deep dark Belgian brew pours into the goblet with a color like an abyss.  The foamy beige head dissipates rather quickly but gives off an earthy aroma with hints of Belgian yeast and the scent of raisins.  The flavor literally crescendos from the first sip from a light bubbly earthy flavor to a deep raisin and dark malt with a warming character that rivals a bonfire after a day in the freezing wilderness.  The finish is clean and slightly fruity.  The aerated mouth-feel does not at all harsh the brew.  I am really developing a love for Belgian Ales."
"750ml bottle, corked & caged. Hazy with yeast & sediment in suspension. Dark tawny copper with reddish highlights. The slight head is made up of very fine light tan bubbles that cannot hold. Lace is limited as well (probably linked to the high alcohol and youth of the bottle). One would hope that a greater head will develop with age. The aroma is rich with dark fruit, candyish notes, alcohol and a toasted maltiness. The body is medium with a lively but gentle effervescence from tiny bubbles, giving a zesty-spritzy mouthfeel that compliments the spice and pepper notes of the beer. The flavor is sweet with a soft, fruity character that's reminiscent of all the Chimay beers, and delicately balanced by bitterness and spice. Swirling flavors of dark fruits, spicy complex alcohols and soft chocolate-like malts combine in a light, but impressive display across the palate. The alcohol is not overly aggressive but still quite noticeable in this, Chimay's strongest beer at 9%. The finish is somewhat thin with a slightly dry lingering aftertaste. At times I've considered each of the 3 Chimay beers to be my favorite, which I see as a great tribute to the monastery. This particular vintage is a bit young at present, but it's still quite unique and very enjoyable as it is. A year of cellaring should improve it greatly."
"Deep color in color with a nice amount of tan head.  Fruit flavors are dominant, but quickly followed by the signature belgian yeast.  Very complex beer as the more you drink, the more flavors are revealed.  ABV is noticeable, but did not detract from the brew."
"Very dark amber in color with tight cream color foam. Nice pleasant complex smell and taste of fruits and roasted nuts. Slightly on the sweet side with a tangy but not bitter finish. Just a little sourness on the after taste also. Best Belgium brew so far!"
"750ml bottle date stamped 10/01 on the cork. Pours a deep rich copper color. Tight thin tan head, rather foamy and flavorful. Lots of complex smells, rum roasted plums, and other fruits along with big belgium yeasty smells. Nothing dominates, just complicates.  Nice subtle tastes however. Rich rum soaked fruits hit your taste buds, first, then some yeast middle. Lots of subtle tastes present. Alcohol is noticable, and makes for a thin feel. I would make this an after dinner night cap beer, not one to guzzle down with dinner. I expected something more spectacular, but still a very good belgian ale."
"Poured very dark, almost like a port.  Big creamy tan head with little bubbles stayed throughout most of the time.  Smells of port, with hints of nutmeg and figs, maybe.  Althought the taste is rich and powerful, it is far from overwhelming.   It is so smooth and wonderful, I seem to forget how good this beer really is.   This is a sweet beer, full of flavor, with such character, it is unique and stands alone."
"Ehhhhh I expected more out of this. Pours nearly black with a thin lace on top. This will kick you square in the balls at 9% and that alcohol taste is prevalent. I found the taste very similar to Duvel, but much more bitter. Duvel is good...this stuff was not."
"Nice and evident but restrained aroma of berries, maybe strawberries. Darker, opaque brown color, mound-holding 1/2 inch head. Deep woodsy flavor, touch of caramelized oak barrel and a back-taste of brown sugary notes. Quite light-bodied and spritzy, the final impression is fuller and very pleasant. Very distinct flavor, nice. Alcohol has more of an effect on the brain than in the taste."
"It's a nice dark red to brown with a healthy beige head. Spice and hops are noticeable in the smell. It has a slightly yeasty flavor with a fruity flavor close to raisin and a nice spicy kick. It's well-balanced and the smell and flavor of alcohol are barely detectable. A very nice beer."
"Pours dark ruby with a great head that melds into ""rolling hills"" as the head ever so gradually dissipates.  There's a pungent yeast aroma.  Slight amount of fruity esters on the nose too.  Fair amount of carbonation.  Goes down the hatch fairly smooth for a 9% a/v.  Either this beer is fairly bland or I just have a hard time identifying taste qualities in Belgian beers.  I get a little sour tartness and a deeply hidden candied apple taste.  I don't get much more.  It is a very drinkable high alcohol beer without a lot of appealing flavors in my opinion.  Blasphemy I know being such a highly regarded Trappist brew."
"An outstanding beer, very close to ""perfect"". I agree with all the positive things said by other reviewers, and has little more to add. The spicy, oaky complexity of the aroma and flavour is ""out of this world"". Wonderful, lingering aftertaste. Alcohol is well hidden. Simply exceptional!"
"A great beer, dry palate with decently bitter finish, hints of chocolates, cloves, caramel (quite malty). Not my favoured Chimay, but damn good non the less."
"139"
"Everything about this beer was great except I couldn't drink the whole bottle. Nice pour, bits of spice but mostly fruit on the nose. The Red and Blue were available in MN. I heard the Red was better but never got to it, now I can't find it. One thing though, make sure the bottle wasn't either overly cold or sitting warm. Everybody I know ended up with an inconsistent bottle or a bad tongue."
"This is one of those beer-nirvana experiences. You can tell by the look (ruby-brown, rich tan head), and the aroma (dark fruit, spice, brown sugar, pepper), that this is special. The taste is so complex, yet so balanced, that God must be playing a part in there somewhere (and I am not necessarily a religious man!). Sweet, dry finish. This is a world-class beer!"
"This from a batch/or bottled in Jan. '01, purchased on the day of my Daughter's birth, aged with a LOT of patience for exactly 1 year in my cellar. Pours a beautiful slightly hazy ruby-ish hue, with the usual lively& effervescent Chimay head, nose is oh so slightly corky, with the ""horse blanket"" bouquet present. Taste - smooth maltiness followed by a nice complexity of (in order of domination)malt yeast & hops...the aftertaste just seems to evolve everytime I smack my lips, with just enough hop bitterness to make themselves known. Beautiful, a great bottle enjoyed on a great occasion! Beers of this magnitude are meant to be savored for special times."
"Muddy brown hue, w/ hazy deep ruby when held to light. Dense, thick, creamy and smooth light tan head is well retained. Suspended aggregates of yeast from the bottle conditioning. Yeast esters are surprisingly mild, consisting of mild clove and peppermint are perceptible along with pleasantly mellow tart fruit. Nutty, dark caramel malt surface in aroma as the beer warms. The taste is initially quite sweet with raisin like contributions from the dark crystal malt (special B?) Caramelized dark candi sugar notes are also present, but aren't assertive. Mid palate dryish chocolate malt coupled w/ the light hop bitterness lend a bittersweet note and tart fruity esters akin to unripe plums emerge. Moderate in body, w/ a smooth, dextrinous and agreeable mouthfeel that helps facilitate the superb drinkability. Finishes w/ notes of maple sugar and woodiness lingering briefly on the palate. This 750 ml is quite young, being bottled 9/01. Certainly worthy of cellaring. Although not the most complex Dark Strong, Grande Reserve is refined in overall character, being both very flavorful, yet restrained enough to prevent any cloying qualities. Delicious. I'm re-reviewing this. The 750 ml bottle is much more balanced and tasty all around. A true classic."
"  9% abv."
"33 cl bottle, not dated.  An excellent beer, no doubt.  Another one of the world class beers that are so drinkable at 9% but it just didn't have the depth I was anticapating.  Maybe I drank it too young but I'd much rather have a 75 cl bottle of Trios Pistoles for the same price."
"Presentation: 33cl (11.2oz.) capped bottle. Exceptional brew all the way around. Gorgeous dark and hazy appearance. Big malty sweetness blends with peppery yeast spiciness and pleasant alcohol warming sensation. A brew to savor on a special occasion."
"This is one beer that will make you silly quicker than you would ever expect..  It's STRONG, but it tastes so good (very complex fruit notes), you'd never realize what it's doing to you..  This is made by monks?!?  They must have a wicked sense of humor.."
"This beer demands respect.  To fully appreciate it, it should be drank at the proper temperature, and hope that you have a good bottle, because the quality can vary.  But if you get one of the good bottles....it's heaven.  Incredible head and aroma, with a surprisingly light, fruity complex taste for its dark color.  And some serious 9% kick.  Drinking this beer at a campground near the brewery in Chimay, Belgium (where a 750ml bottle is $2.50) was a religious experience."
