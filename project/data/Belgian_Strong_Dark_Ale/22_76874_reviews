"This was a beer I had set aside for my 1000th beer. I change my mind because I asked for a poll on this site (which got deleted -  but the admin gave me congratulations so I don't mind) and on the League on Facebook because it got deleted. I wish I hadn't listened to the poll, which voted for Barrel-Aged Bigfoot. This beer has phenomenal flavor, a darker color than anything I've seen in this style, and it is so smooth."

"Didn't try it upon release, but seems to have really smoothed out, and probably bumped up a few ABV's.. Unfortunately didn't get to write a proper review."
"From bottle with best before date 12/18/2017. Pours deep cloudy red-brown with plenty of tan foam that lingers. Spicy and yeasty aromas. Caramel, bread, and malt, malt, malt. Oak on the finish."

"Appearance 4, Aroma 3, Flavor 3, Palate 3.5, Overall 3.5"

"A very solid beer. I am usually not too fond of Unibroue, maybe it's the yeast or the spice they use, and I know I stand alone on this one, but this beer I found quite drinkable and very nice."
""
""
""
""
""
"Complex mix of chocolate notes, caramel, with some hop bitterness.  The bottle we split was from my bro Sam Bakko, owner of Wolverine Market, and was 2 years old.  This beer is aged in a French oak barrel and the refermented in the bottle.  Strange brew!"

"Tasty and well-priced at the LCBO"

"D - Good to dry.  Afraid one and done for me."

"Dark copper body with a thin off-white head. Apple aroma with caramel malt and alcohol. Pears, Belgian yeast, booze. Sweet flavor tempered with a touch of Saaz/bittering hops. Hints of white wine. Tasty but a bit boozy. Decent."
""
""
""
""
""
"This is the last bottle of Unibroue for me. Canada produces  many beers with higher malt content and malt quality and more careful fermentation regimen."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Sensational! It's not remarkable in its flavor components or its complexity (compared to other beers within the style), but the overall balance and polish is brilliant. Superbly satisfying. Worth seeking out."
""
""
""
"Overall:  I enjoyed this beer more as the time went on.  More and more flavors opened up and made this beer quite the treat.  Definitely will have to revisit this one again."

"t/m/o - as the nose suggests, a perfect balance of Belgian sweetness and dark fruit.  Perhaps this one has peaked but if so, it was recent as it is tasty like a champ at the moment.it has that fantastic Unibroue feel.  The regular 17 is definitely on the syrupy side, but not as bad as the nose suggested...but the grand reserve is in a really nice place right now.  Drink up if you have em."
""
""
"Reminds me a lot of Rochefort 10 except a bit more carbonated. Huge dark fruit flavor -- plums mainly. Bit of oak flavor. Velvety mouthfeel. Delicious, dangerously easy to drink 10% beer."
""
"Price Point - $12.99/ 750 ML bottle"
""
""
""
""
"A great Belgian style ale....typical for Unibroue."
""
"Nice beer with so plum and prune."
"O: More subdued than expected but not to a fault, would drink again"
""
""

"The beer pours a dark chestnut brown with a foamy off-white head that provides substantial and unwavering bubble coverage and leaves a thick coat of sticky lacing while drinking. The nose is yeast-forward with a hint of dried fig, alcohol, light oak and molasses (more so with warmth). It's full flavored with a slightly nutty malt base, bubble-gummy yeast, and lingering tannic bitterness. The beer has  a rich winter-weather approved malt base, but is stretched thin by a big yeast fruit presence, bitter oak astringency, and double digit abv. The beer's generous carbonation helps oxy-clean some of those heavy flavors off the palate, but it still sits heavier than expected. Regardless of a less than desirable mouthfeel/drinkability, it's a solid bargain bin find!"
""
"This is a 2012 bottle, so it has a couple years of age on it."
"Overall: A masterful beer. Great flavor, rich but not heavy, complex but subtle, great execution. The dry finish is a slight drag on the total package, but encourages another tasty sip."
""
""
""
""
"Great beer.$ 2.96 a bottle and 24.95 a case for 2013 vintage. Had to buy a case and set back a few so much can compare in a couple of years. This brew is known for its aging qualities."
""
""
""
"I have to say the mouthfeel is fantastic with this beer....wonderful cascade of bubbles that flow right down...perfect! Taste is not too sweet, just what I wanted...very happy with this one."

"Overall: I purchased this bottle to celebrate tasting my 500th different brew and the boys up North sure didn’t disappoint. This ale is brewed once yearly and this particular example was bottled in 2013. Past awards include 68 Gold and 8 Platinum Awards in International Judging. This is a beer that deserves to speak for itself. Hunt one down and save it for a quiet, reflective night."

"2013. 750 ml bottle at Beer Authority, NYC. Paid way too much but I look at it as a one time thing. I'm a big Unibroue fan because of the unique yeast flavor. This brew has just a hint as the stars are the caramel/malt flavors. This thing is growing on me proportionally to the rose in my cheeks. I can feel, from behind the mask, my complexion turning to that of the jovial monk that bedecks most Trappist labels. It's 70F outside but I'm in a Yuletide flava'. Do not....I repeat ...do not...misconstrue this as a complaint. The further I get into this endeavor, the more disembodied I get. Is that Tim Leary over there drinking W/Jerry Garcia. Methinks it just might be. In the end this was a most enjoyable venture."

"Bottled in 2013.  Mahogany color with a massive amount of khaki head.  Smells of dark fruits, spices, some cocoa, and caramel malt.  Delicious tasting with caramel malt, dark fruits, spices, yeast, light chocolate, and a bit of oak in the finish.  Has some alcohol warming to it.  Medium body with high carbonation.  Another great beer by Unibroue."

"Overall – like most of Unibroue’s beers, this is a very enjoyable and quite tasty brew with lots of robust flavors that blend rather well with each other. A very tasty Belgian strong dark."

"Overall - Very sweet. Pretty interesting, though."

"The first taste made me something like galangal or ginger. It has a lot going on flavor-wise, layers of flavor. There is a very, very subtle bitterness, not hoppy though and a back of the mouth almost peppery taste. I think there must be roasted barley in there somewhere that gives it that caramel undertone. The oak mellows and rounds out the ale perfectly. It is clean and refreshing. How many 10% alcohol beers can you say that about? World Class."

"Pouring GR17 produced a 1.5"" creamy beige coloured head with a beautiful convex cap. The head lasted for over 5 minutes before fading to a thin film and collar of foam, leaving moderate spotting and lacing down the glass. The beer itself was a dark brown colour, which lightened a few shades around the edges of the glass when backlit. Its aroma was of sweet malts, chocolate and alcohol, with hops in the background. As the beer warmed the alcohol aroma became more noticeable and a strong candied fruit smell arose. The taste began with a sweet chocolate flavour, giving way to candied fruit, with a mild (and not at all unpleasant) alcohol burn, finishing with a mild hop bitterness. A mild bitter aftertaste was evident, but balanced the initial sweetness of the beer nicely and did not overstay its welcome. GR17 is best described as a rich, full bodied beer, with just the right level of carbonation and a creamy mouthfeel. The 750 ml bottle is best shared with a friend..I would have struggled to finish the bottle alone, as much as I enjoyed the beer. Overall, a wonderful brew from the good folks at Unibroue...I can understand why GR17 has won several international awards. My only knock against the beer is its $9.95 price tag which holds it back on the ""value for money"" factor and puts it into my ""occasional treat"" category. Assuming I have the discipline, I plan to save my second bottle for a few years to see how it develops with cellaring."

"2011vintage. Murky brown colour but the nose makes up for the appearance. Big old fruit and yeasty notes waft out apparent from a foot away. The beer takes Minute to set itself up as the age is a factor on the flavour The beer is quite complex and the sweetness is mostly taken from the finish. It is a great Belgium dubbel that shows off what unibroue is famous for. I have had better beers from them but this is still a great showing"
""

"Pours a murky brown with a foamy khaki head that settles to a small cap on top of the beer. Small patches of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, dried fruit, dark fruit, spice, wood, earth, and alcohol aromas. Taste is much the same with slightly tart malt, dark fruit, spice, vanilla, and wood flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of spice and wood bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good beer with a nice mix of malt, fruit, and earth qualities all around."

"Overall: This is a good offering from Unibroue. Compared to the 2013 vintage at this point, there is less bitterness and more of the sweetness coming through. Easy to find and affordable ($10 per bottle in my area) if Unibroue is available to you. A very good beer, though I find myself preferring some of their other options."
"This is a great beer and I would recommend buying a bottle if you found one anywhere. It is probably the right time to drink this beer."
""

"Very excited. I love Unibroue and when they do something special, it is exactly that. Bottle 2013-046530. It pours a dark, rusty brown with a thin, creamy, and very persistent off white head. The smell is cherries, leather, biscuits, and a faint floral aftersmell. Is that a word? Squiggly red underline says ""no"". The taste is carob, followed by a woodiness and raisin plum thing, with that leather deal-e-o coming on strong in the finish. Definitely barrel aged and definitely fantastic. The mouthfeel is, like the gum offer to Chandler from ""Friends"" while trapped in the ATM vestibule, perfection. Overall, you should buy this. Now. Trust me. I never lie. Well, not about beer anyway. :)"

"2013 vintage, No. 2013-084791. Poured into a goblet. Haven't had a Unibroue in a while and I am rather stoked. A murky root beer brown brew with around five fingers of rich beige head, holding its form well. Aroma is malt-forward and spicy, prunes and raisins, toffee, rum, and strong bready yeast. Good old Unibroue yeast, a fungus that doesn't play around, grabbing your olfactory bulbs and tongue to show you who's boss. Flavor profile includes brown bread, cinnamon and nutmeg, sassafras, coriander seed, applesauce, dry parchment, and a tiny nip of chocolate. There's a decent earthy hop note and the tannic oak dries things out ... Rather hot and woody, I bet this would age well. Fortunately, the sweet and spicy flavors are not overpowered by the wood and aromatic alcohol. Moderately chewy body with fairly aggressive carbonation. Finishes quite dry, with some sour fruit and earthy spice lingering in a most pleasant fashion. I love the laundry list of phenolic flavors one can find in these beers. A wonderful Belgian strong with great yeast character, as expected from this brewery. My own tastes might dictate some additional aging next time."

"O - Not my favorite from this brewer, but a decidedly nice strong beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O: It's a little pricey but worth every penny IMO. I was surprised by its very subdued smell and taste, but it really was delicious. Less estery than I expected for a Belgian style ale, but that was almost a plus. Really pleased with this beer, but not blown away. Which is fine--a really good ale doesn't always need to show off."
"Poured from a 750 ml bottle. Pours a red-tinted chestnut brown colour. Nose offers sweet notes of sweet, dark dried fruit and baking spice. Taste is similar with notes of cinnamon, raisins, booze and Belgian yeast spice. A big sipper for cold evenings."
""
""
"O: Definitely one of the best beers of the style, certainly one of the best to be found outside Belgium. Definitely worth seeking out."
""
"Overall- Good to really good, but mostly really good. I haven't had a Unibroue I wouldn't suggest trying and this is no exception. But try the other ones first. Also, this gets closer to some of the more renowned quads as it starts to have a very strong raisin profile. It's reminding me a lot of Westy at the moment but I'm sure this is only in one aspect. Still pretty good."
"Final Grade: 4.56, an A+. This brewery never ceases to amaze me - as much as I love Unibroue's other strong dark ales, I think I'd have to say that Grande Réserve 17 tops even superb classics like Maudite or La Terrible. The French oak aging really helps this brew stand out from the crowd, and the end result is a sinfully tasty, complex, lip-smackingly good winter sipper that no fan of Belgian-style beers should neglect to try. My only regret - that I didn't pick up another bottle to cellar! Oh well, there's always next year's batch."
""
""
""
""
"Overall this brew is superb. Alcohol is well hidden, taste is delicious and very smooth. Unibroue has this style nailed down stone cold!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured into a chalice a nice dark grape color, nice carbonation, with a little fizzy off-white head, with very minimal sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, with some nice yeast notes, plums, figs, grapes, and raisins. The taste is very nice, malty, yeasty, with lots of dark fruit goodness. The ABV is hidden very well with this brew. Medium body. Overall another very nice brew from Unibroue."
""
"Overall - Really complex and something that is pretty different from the other beers in the Unibroue lineup. I have a few bottles tucked away and can't wait to see how they taste aged."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"It tastes smoothly mellow, giving off hints of stone fruit, raisin, and a leathery vanillin whisper. It’s smooth, mellow, sweet and pleasing. It hides the ABV well."
""
""
"Overall - A wonderful Belgian style Ale, and has a chance of being my second favorite Unibroue product ever (behind Le Fin Du Monde). Delicious and eminently quaffable despite the high ABV, highly recommended. The downside to this may be the price as there are similar quality beers (albeit different) available for cheaper."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - really intense! tons of aroma and flavors. this is pretty easy to drink but best enjoyed slowly. definitely not for everyone but overall this was another very enjoyable experience from Unibroue and i plan on picking a few more bottles for a later date."
""
""
"This is a nice brew. It was brewed in 2011 with a best by date of 12-12-16. I drank this on 11-23-12 and it is nice and smooth."
"Impossibly intricate and nuanced for the abv. Also dangerously drinkable. A very good Belgian Dark Ale worth seeking out. This brewery has a knack at these super strong Belgian styles."
""
"Thx for reading"
""
"O: This is everything I hoped it would be and more. A truly world-class Belgian Strong Dark ale. The balance is perfect, and the high level of complexity makes each sip a treat. One of the more refined beers I've come across. The French oak really makes it. Instantly a personal favorite."
""
""
""
"OVERALL : This brew ages exceptionally well. I'd compare it to Carolus Van de Keizer Blue. Quite spectacular, even if it can get a bit overwhelming at times. Very glad I still another of the same vintage sleeping on my shelves."
""
""
""
"Poured into a Unibroue tulip glass. Monster head on top of a dark brown brew. Smell of some pepper, yeast, raisin, clove. Aroma really sweetens up as it warms. Mouthfeel is surprisingly light, with heavy carbonation. Some figfy fruit and alcohol on the tongue. Finishes somewhat dry with some bready malt. Easy drinking, but not as complex as I had expected. Maybe a but more aging will bring the flavors out. Will have to grab another one to put away for a while."
""
""
"O: a fine way to celebrate the end of the football season, I enjoyed this on a cool fall afternoon. The unibroue yeast is ever present and the spice profile is nice and enjoyable. I am going to pick a few 2013s up soon."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is FANTASTIC! I think with my experience with this beer, Unibroue is one of my new favorite breweries. Every beer they make is not only exceptional, but true to form. The Grand Reserve 17 is simply terrific! Smell is great: the oak barrel aging really stands out as well as wine, vanilla, strawberry, spice, plum, and many others. Wonderful beer to just enjoy the smell of. Taste is remarkably balanced, lots of fruit flavors working together. Apple, dates, cherries, figs, vanilla, lemon... lots going on. Mouthfeel is smooth and light, faint boozey heat, and light carbonation. This is seriously great... gonna try and pick up some more!"

"Pours a cloudy brown color. 1/2 inch head of an off-white color. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of alcohol, sweet malt, spices, dark citrus, slight hops, hint of cherry, and a hint of grass. Fits the style of a Belgian Strong Dark Ale. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of sweet malt, alcohol, dark citrus, yeast, hint of hops, hint of pale malt, and slight spice. Overall, good appearance, aroma, blend, and body."
""
"OV: A solid and tasty brew, just not quite what I was anticipating. I thought it would be a heartier darker Ale with a bit of a more chewy body. Description on the bottle says ""A Dark Ale", but to me it's more of a Brown Ale which I don't consider 'dark' since Brown Ales look dark red when you hold them to the light. Black and plum are dark, brown is an Earth tone. Whatever. I like it just fine as it's got some nice flavours on it. A good sipper or would even pair well with rich desserts or foods with heavier sauces."
""
""
""
"Well, the only thing I can complain about really is the price. This is pretty much the most expensive beer I've ever bought, unfortunately. However, it IS quite enjoyable."
""

"O - a very nice belgian and while the potency isn't masked like many higher ABV brews ive become accustomed to, the sugary offset is a pleasing balance"
""
""
""
"Overall - 4.75/5 Been waiting to try this for a while now. A seriously complex brew...this review doesn't do it justice. Regardless, the wait didn't disappoint, and this is easily my favorite offering from Unibroue thus far."
""
"pour is hazy dark brown with tight light tan head. Nose is heavy candied sugar with notes of oak, lightly cooked brown sugar, a bit peppery, slightly green vegetable, strong dark berry aroma and a tinge of alcohol. Taste follows suit, a bit sweet, lots of berries and candied sugar, light oak balanced in fairly well, a hint of green herb and alcohol in the finish. Body is smooth and full, assertive carbonation and semi dry finish. There is a cooked sugar note that lingers with sweet dark berry after the finish."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"It's a big, strong beer. Definitely a sipper. Tastes more like a seasonal for the fall or winter months with all the spice. A good beer, probably something that could use some more aging."
"Overall even for a Belgian dark and particularly a barrel aged one the qualities on this really seem to be missing and toned down."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, not the greatest BSDA I've ever had, but I do enjoy the balance of sweet and sour. I'd probably take a Chimay Blue over it, but considering I can't get that in NB, this is a great alternative (though it is $13 a bottle, compared to Unibroue's other $5.88 bottles,"
""
""
""
"Solid brew. Complex flavors and aroma, not to mention beautiful to look at. Another classic from Unibroue."
"O - Will be saving another 2011 dated bottle for future years. A good Belgian Strong Dark Ale with no overwhelming fruit taste that some others have. Great beer."

"O: I've always loved Unibroue, and this just cemented itself as my new favorite beer. I picked this up as a whim while on vacation, and now have 2 in my cellar. I'm going to try one in a year, and then the other on the ""best by date," in four years. I definitely reccomend picking this up whenever you can."

"750ml corked and caged bottle shared with NewBrewBB (thanks Brett). Served in a taster. Pours a deep, brownish amber with a loose, cream-colored head that dissipates into a swirl across the center and a tight band around the edges. Nose expresses dark fruit, toasted notes, and a hint of buttery oakiness. Taste follows nose; however, the flavors are really masked by the carbonation. Mouthfeel is light-medium in body with an extremely gassy/prickly carbonation and a dry finish. Overall, a decent beer - typical Unibroue quality; however, the extreme carbonation kills it a bit."
""
""
"O - Superbly done and ranks as one of the top Belgian Dark Ales I've experienced so far. Seek this one out, buy extras, enjoy one now and cellar the others. This 2011 bottle is stamped with a ""Best By"" of 12-12-16. Would love to have a bottle to try each year as it moves closer to that Best By date."

"The smell is incredibly strong, just like the taste. The complexity of this beer is exceptional, the spices and european yeasts last very long. Very high carbonation and medium body. The beer is overall bitter, but with some fruity notes. It's 10% ABV, but you can't really taste it."

"750 ml bottle into signature tulip glass, bottled on 12/12/2011. Pours very hazy dark reddish brown color with a nice 2 finger dense and fluffy light khaki head with fantastic retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Nice thick soapy lacing clings on the glass, with plenty of carbonation streaming up retaining the head. Aromas of big raisin, prune, fig, apple, pear, molasses, brown sugar, toast, toffee, caramel, herbal, banana, pepper, clove, cinnamon, and yeast earthiness. Fantastic aromas with big complexity and great balance of malt and fruity esters. Taste of big raisin, prune, fig, molasses, brown sugar, toffee, toast, herbal, banana, pepper, clove, cinnamon, light oak, and yeast earthiness. Lingering notes of dark fruits, molasses, brown sugar, caramel, toast, toffee, herbal, banana, pepper, clove, cinnamon, oak, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a while. Fantastic balance and complexity of dark malt, spice, and fruity esters; with zero cloying sweetness present after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a creamy, slick, earthy, and lightly prickly mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is extremely well hidden with only a slight warming noticed well after the finish. Overall this is an incredible Belgian strong dark ale! Big complexity and balance of malt and fruity esters; and dangerously smooth to sip on. An absolutely top notch offering all around."
""
"D - Great BSDA. Great balance and the oak is a nice touch."
""
""
"OK...many minutes later...small head...aroma of funky fruit and toasty malts. Flavors are rich and unique...powder sugar meets tropical fruit with sweet malts. There's also an uncomfortable bitterness, something slightly burning, perhaps some oxidation (might have tasted great at the brewery!), perhaps the French oak...not smooth, not easy drinking. This particular bottle is perhaps rougher than the 100+ Unibroue bottles I've ever tried...humm."
""
"Pours a two-finger cream head that fades slowly leaving some lace. Hazy brown color. Light carbonation and medium bodied. Dark fruit nose and flavor is semi-sweet dark fruit and oak. Some yeastiness in finish. High ABV is hidden. Good dark ale but Unibroue's Trois Pistoles is better and cheaper. $11.99 for a caged and corked 750ml bottle from The Meat House Pembroke, NH."
""
""
""
""
"Medium bodied with mild carbonation. Smooth, and easy to drink. The alcohol is well hidden for 10.00 % abv. This is another well made beer by Unibroue."
"Overall, a true champion that other beers could learn a thing or two from. Thank you Unibroue"
""
"The beer pours a murky mahogany color with a finger of fluffy off white head. The head sticks around nicely. The small and taste are both super oaky. It's like drinking a dark Belgian ale in a workshop. There are some sweet sugar and dark fruit undertones in the smell. The flavor is more balanced, but still dominated by the oak. There is a nice dark fruit component and just a slight sweetness. There is a mild Belgian spice in the finish. The abv is not at all apparent. The mouthfeel is a bit on the thin side and the carbonation is quite smooth. The finish isn't as dry as I would expect given the oak level."
""
"Tasty beer, I was actually expecting a Strong Pale Ale. Solid beer."
"In style 4.75"
""
"Overall: a fantastic yeasty beer, just the way a belgian ale should be, although wouldn't have minded a bit more variety in the fruit flavours"
""

"Overall: A nice take on the BSDA style by Unibroue; the tartness in the middle is an intriguing twist"

"Overall: I think Unibroue is one of the truly elite breweries in the world. Their products consistently bring top notch quality. This Anniversary Ale is a true delight and worth a buy."
"Definitely a major-league beer; wish I had tried the 2011 without aging for comparison. For me, melding and mellowing of flavors plus carbonation cuts score a bit, but this is very, very good."

"Pours a deep, dark murky amber capped with a light beige two finger fluffy, sea-foam like head which reduces to a light foam cover. A lot oak, dark fruit notes, Belgian yeast, and a whiff of alcohol on the nose. Constant mild toasted oak accents throughout. Dates, figs, mild spice perhaps some clove, brown sugar maltiness, bold yeasty esters. Finishes bone dry with candi sugar and oak. Lively carbonation, fairly full-bodied smooth, and finishes with some silkiness. An excellent brew. Some may be turned off by the upfront oak presence, but I really think it worked well here. Tasty stuff, without a doubt."

"750ml bottle purchased at Tully's in Wells, ME. Pours a murky nearly opaque dark brown with a good inch of khaki-colored head. Ripe banana, raisin, date, pear, and toffee comprise the aroma. Ripe banana, pear, spice, raisin, and toffee all fairly equally make the flavor. Medium bodied with ample carbonation. Excellent. A little on the sweet side, but I really cannot find a true flaw with this one. Superb."

"O - a great offering from Unibroue as usual, however, I prefer this one fresh."
"A terrific brew that takes the Belgian Dark Ale to some exciting levels. A thoroughly enjoyable brew over the course of an evening. Worth a pick up!"

"Overall a very good BSDA. About what I'd expect from Unibroue."
"O: Extremely balanced Belgian style ale that is not overly sweet. One of the best ales I’ve ever had. Every bit as good as any trappist ale in my opinion. Went well with the tortiere (Quebec’s meat pie) and steak. Would have paired well with cheeses too, but would be great by itself. We had a bottle from 2011 aged for a year, drank on Dec 31st, 2012."
""
"O - This brew delivered and I'm glad i was able to take it down alongside my BA bro in crime. This is a brew that ages quite well and has a dangerously hidden ABV. The alcohol is only detectable in the belly, making for a delicious and wildly satisfying ale. Grab a few if they're available, you won't be disappointed."
""
""
"O: I wanted a good belgian so I got Unibroue and they delivered. Boy did they deliver. Wonderful beer, wonderful wonderful beer."

"O- What a knockout. Definitely the best dark offering I've ever had from Unibroue. If you're a fan of the Belgians, you've gotta try this."
""

"Burnt orange colour with ruby highlights. The beer gushes upon opening, and on pouring forms a massive pale beige head. Poor retention and lacing. The aroma is complex with fig, raisin, banana, nut; and delicate clove & vanilla notes. Malty and estery, opening with nut, and dried fruit (raisin and cherry) flavours. There is a strong clove note and a hint of banana mid-palate, followed by a strong oak flavour that provides a tannic finish. Full-bodied and moderately carbonated. The carbonation is very finely textured. There is a slippery, almost greasy quality to the mouthfeel that is especially noticeable between sips. Perhaps diacetyl at a level low enough that I can't find it with my nose or palate, but noticeable to the sense of touch. Whatever the cause, I think this beer feels wonderful in my mouth. A complex and satisfying beer - the tannic quality is challenging to my palate, but in a pleasant kind of way. It's strength is very well hidden as well - the alcohol is only really noticeable in terms of how it makes you feel. This is powerful stuff - in terms of flavour, potency, and sheer enjoyment."

"If I had to choose between the two, I would say the Dec. 2010 bottling was better. I’ll definitely be on the lookout for more. The 17th Anniversary Grande Reserve 2011 bottling could probably benefit from additional aging; glad I bought a couple more for the cellar. Overall, both vintages are fantastic beers that I look forward to enjoying over the years."
"Fully expected this to be a quality dark ale and it didn't dissappoint. Very nice especially on a cold night like tonight."
""
""
"O- let her warm! It's so complex when it's at near room temp. I sipped it out of the fridge and was hit with booze, i then let it sit and warm and suddenly it was a whole new beer, full of complexities. Vanilla, oak, leather all shown through, one after the other dark fruits began to emerge, plums, grapes, raisins, prunes. Finally roasted nutty malts sprang forth, creating an awesomely balanced brew. I can go on and on as i continue to find more and more flavors/aromas, but i still have half a bomber to enjoy."
""
""
"overall - very good beer, but not sure I pick up any of the oak flavor."
""
""
""
"A bit of a disappointment for me now, but I think this beer would do really well with age to tame the oak and booze. Just too raw as a fresh beer, but I see immense upside for the future of this one."
""
""
""
"O: Awesome brew. French oak aging must have added extra layers of complexities in the nose and taste. Highly recommended."
"D - A BSDA with something to say about the style. It seems most European craft beer is rooted in tradition, while American craft is about pushing boundaries. This North American take on a Belgian classic both satisfies my thirst for traditional Belgian ale and gives me something I haven't tasted before. Just another reason why Unibroue is the best brewery in Canada, bar none."

"O: I love a good dark Belgian, and this may take the top spot as a new favorite. Once again, Unibroue fails to disappoint. Excellent job, chaps."

"I've start drinking microbrewery beer partly because of that beer back in 2007, but while the new one is good but has nothing to impress, the bottle that I've opened tonight was worth the five year I've waited to drink it."
"Tasty. A bold, sweet, strong sipper. Right up my alley. Would buy again."

""
""

"Overall, this beer had immense promise on the nose, and while most of that translated well to the tongue, the interplay between spice and dark fruit created a strange rubbery taste around the edges, much the way that over-spiced fruitcake comes across as over-caramelized (the point of near-burnt) and slightly bitter. The beer is still good, but this bitter layer adds just enough of a strangeness that it becomes slightly off-putting. The beer is still worth trying, but I wish the taste had more closely followed the nose."

"O: This is such a nice beer and glad that I found a few bottles. I enjoy the wine flavor that it has and like the body. So nice."
""
"O- Pretty much what I was hoping for."
""
"O: A damn good beer. It hides the 10% ABV scarily well and goes down really easily. It is a nice balance of sweet and spice. Would definitely drink again."
""
"O: The dark fruits paired with the oak aging creates depth and richness in both the flavour and on the nose. Unibroue proves once again that it can tip the scales from great brew to excellent. It's well worth picking up a few bottles, sniff, sip and enjoy."

""
""
"Poured into a large brandy snifter. Pours dark toffee brown with a biege colored head that retreats pretty slowly. Some bubbles can be seen meeting the underside of the head. Some lacing is left on the side of the glass as the head retreats. I pick up some apple, grape, cherry, and maybe raisin aroma up front with some spiciness, some of those malt aromas, sweetness, some alcohol, and some of that wood. The taste follows the nose. The fruity aromas I detected like the apple, grape, cherry, and raisin are there. I pick up some of those spices, toffee, dark malt, oak, and some barely detectable alcohol heat. The body is medium with strong carbonation, which is to be expected from a bottle conditioned beer. The finish is sweet, but also clean. This is excellent and absolutely worth the price."
"Overall a very delightful anniversary ale from Unibroue. Strong, with a nice alcohol warmth to it. Mellowed out nicely as it came to room temps. Recommended"
""

"O: Alcohol still fairly well hidden for a brew meant to mellow with age. One of Unibroue's better offerings, which says a lot. Really wish I had the patience to cellar one of these."

"This thing is gorgeous, one of the best dark Belgians I've ever had - and it's from Montreal. One of those cases where the whole is even better than the sum of its considerable parts. I'd recommend this to anyone interested in a fantastic Belgian, or any beer experience for that matter."

"these guys can do no wrong in my opinion, so this beer is obviously fantastic. it came at what i thought was a reasonable price at under 13 bucks for a big boy. it pours a rich mahogany maroon color with a very excited head rising to as tall as three inches in my tulip glass. it smells very oaky, and has notes of dark fruit, dried cherries, sauvignon grapes, and vanilla. the flavor is rich and fit for a king, with the fruit and yeast combining in a way that only unibroue can pull off. its deep and complex, lots of fruit but not too much sweet. the alcohol is very well hidden behind the curtain of autumnal flavors and oak. the wood in this beer is perfectly complimentary to the other flavors, its awesome. feel is heavier in body but somehow airy, partially due to the effervescent head. i like this a lot, and would have probably paid another four or five dollars for this bottle. id like to get another and cellar it just to see what happens, if i can be patient enough..."
"Overall, a really good example. If I would have been sure when I bought this how good it was, I would have bought two. Aging would really be interesting. One of the best beers I have had in a while."

"Full bodied, smooth, rich, almost creamy texture. This slides across the tongue like it knows the way. The only knock is the fairly thick coating that forms on the upper palate and tongue. Lightly effervescent and then mostly at the tip of the tongue. A malt/clove/oak mixture lingers for a good long time to remind you just how lucky you are to drink this alchemical masterpiece. Thank you, Unibroue."
""
""
"Really nice beer here, one I would gladly have again and again. It has a nice complexity, the only thing keeping me from scoring it higher is a bit of lack of balance. Very much worth a try."
""
""
""
"Erm, well, WOW! Barrel (maybe?) treatment with a subtle touch, for my favorite (thus and by far) of Unibroue's anniversary offerings. What's not to like? Smooth, subtle, and beguiling, and in one of my favourite styles.  Zut alors - je vous aime, je veux être avec vous pour toujours!"
""
"Overall, I quite like this and everything is blended together well."
""
"Overall - A truly complex Belgian strong dark ale by Unibroue. An array of flavours that blend beautifully. The alcohol is quite concealed (in my opinion), which can be dangerous. Definitely a rarity - if you spot this one in your local beer store, don't leave without it."
"Overall, this was pretty far from the typical BSDA, yet it was more to my liking than many of them. The roasted malt really made this one a bit more complex and it kept it away from cloying sweetness. The first bottle I had nearly a year ago wasn't so memorable, but I think it's really improved with a little bit of age."
"Pours out a nice dark murky brown and amber color, very little lights gets through and its topped off with a nice thick khaki head that just created a nice plain of bubbles, and the lacing is awesome. The smell is filled with dark fruit, spices, raisin, coriander (very, very mild) fig and faint strawberry and vanilla come through too. Crisp on the tongue, its slightly bitter overall, but filled with sweet dark fruits and fig flavors. Its got a medium mouth feel and the alcohol come out just a bit in its aftertaste. This one good beer"
""

"Drink- Its a tasty beer from Unibroue. All of them are. I think Im just being nitpicky on this one because I expected more from the Anniversary beers. Ill probably grab another one to sit on for a couple years."

"O - I don't hand out 5's lightly but this deserves it overall, super complex, easy drinking, just a pleasure every time I take a sip"
""
"Overall - A very nice beer but I think I would take a La Fin Du Monde or a Terrible over this one. Great for a try though"
""
""
"O - This is an excellent beer. The dark fruits and caramel/brown sugar work really well off of the spicy and banana strong Belgian yeast strain. A beer worth cellaring for sure, seems like it would evolve really well over time."

""
""
"D: This was an excellent barrel aged quad. Tons of refinement and delicate complexity in the scent and taste. The body was nearly perfect, and the alcohol was very well hidden. Smooth finish too, so it was very easy to drink, but worth sipping. Definitely built to age for a long time, but quite enjoyable fresh. Recommended."
""

"Overall: This beer is really good, I wish I remember how much it went for because I have had it sitting for a very long time also considering it was probably bottled about a year ago. If you can find it, give it a go...Salud!"

"A- "

"Poured from a 22oz bottle into a tulip glass, 2011 edition. This pours a hazy dark brown tea color with a massive foamy tan head with a pretty good retention. The smells are of sweet malts, yeast easters, banana, ripe fruit, funk. The feel is medium, high carbonation. The taste is pretty good full flavor lots of sweetness malts, fruit and a little dry on the day down. The high alcohol is completely absent."
"I highly recommend this beer. World class."
""
"I asked the 'Beer Guy' at the store about it and he said smooth Chimay Blue that has been oak aged. He is quite knowledgeable on what he sells and he was dead on with this one. The fact that it was also on sale made even that much better of a find. I am going to try and get another bottle or two just to put up in the back of the fridge."
"Good, but I'd prefer much easier and cheaper beers from unibroue better too. Maybe it's too young yet, it's hard to tell."
""
""
""
""
"O: More on the bitter side than sweet, this Belgian Strong Dark Ale is quite complex. For my money, though, I prefer Terrible."
""
""
"O- This beer is simple yet elegant with lots of subtle flavors working together. This makes it hard to describe aswell. Very nice beer."
"This bottle was drank alongside an original Unibroue 17, which had developed more dark fruit and yeast components during its aging period."
"O:  I was really expecting a lot out of this beer since it was my #100 and I can honestly say I underestimated the beauty of this beast. This is without a doubt the best BSDA I have ever had. Granted I am a novice and have not sampled many. However, I find it hard to believe that it gets much better. I still have stock in my collection and will seek out more because I'm curious to see how long it lasts.  If you haven't had this and it's available grab as many bottles as you can find. Cheers!"

"Nutty malty aromas, dried fruit - raisin, currant, dates, some vanilla and oak traces. Flavors follow suit with a low level amount of oak in the background, dominant Belgian yeast lending clove and spice, candi sugar stickiness, and some residual dried fruit in the aftertaste. Full bodied, though it comes off a little thin in the finish. It does seem well suited for cellaring a year or two. A tasty BSDA, and it was nice to get a chance to try it."
"Bottled in 2011 #2011-167353, damn a 10% alcohol Unibroue aged on French Oak this looked interesting. Pours a beautiful murky deep amber with a muddled mahogany brown overcast, big khaki tan head floating thick about three fingers worth in my Tripel Karmeliet chalice. Nose brings out rich mild smoked character with hints of toasted oak, a sliced apple, plump raisin, plums make up the fruit malt base with spice pepper like quality in there going on. Flavors are so balanced with rich oak notes, a mild vanilla spiced character basically the spice additions and French oak staves they aged it on have blended beautifully with this ten percent alcohol dark Belgian style ale. Again spicy floral character within the spice collides with vanilla, toasted oak with a fruity malt base keeping things interesting big layers of raisins/apple, and rum soaked plum with caramelized sugars don't become cloying at any point with alcohol burning just enough to balance out the sweet qualities of this rich oak aged ale. Mouthfeel is effervescent, yet big bodied with a bit of booze that is cohesive within the dynamics that this beer offers big dry oak in the finish with a pleasant robust malt profile throughout each sip. I will also credit some of the dry qualities from the spice additions that Unibroue is so well known for. Overall I'm proud to say I've been drinking Uniibroue bieres since 2001, I'm glad I found them so early in my drinking career."

"Never had a bad offering from Unibroue, and this one didn't dissappoint. Love this style, and this is one of the better Belgium Strongs I've had. Definately recommend and so glad this one made it to TX."

"O: a very tasty beer overall. I enjoyed the regular 17, and the oak barrels add some nice flavors and aromas to it."
"Pours with a bold tan head (2+ fingers). Dark brown and crimson in color. Great retention. Has a grainy aroma with some dark fruits (cherries, black grapes) phenols and slight vinegar notes. A splash of dark fruit to the tongue is followed by a certain graininess, burnt sugar, sweet bread and light hops. Some cotton candy sweetness is noticed as it warms and I find some oak deep down. Medium bodied and a bit airy, smoothly textured, and with a thin veil of alcohol heat. Residing in the realm of the best. I only with this wasn't a one-off."
"A damn fine BSDA that balances the sweet and spice very well. Excellent aging and complexity."
""
"O: I remember the original barely, though I remember quite liking it. I had a bunch of belgians at this point of my life without my revelation that beer can be better, I just always chalked it up to ""different culture, different beer"". A year or so later I had my epiphany and wished I had stored this beer (store beer? no one does that). Glad to see it back and as delicious as ever."
"Pours a medium dark brown color with a slight haze and a faint red orange highlight when held to light. Good sized tightly bubbled off white head persists forever. Smells of raisins, dark sugar, caramel, clove, banana, and a bit of ethanol. Lightly spicy with a bit of red wine and vanilla. Nice nose. Taste is mostly sweet with a bit of sugary and caramel interspersed with lots of dark dried fruits. Spicy yeasty phenolics mix with a bit of warming alcohol to form a long lingering sweet finish. Over the top level of carbonation, medium body with a bubbly sweet mouthfeel. Nice tasty beer but has that signature Unibroue sameness. Caramel and dark dried fruit with too much carbonation that tries to ruin the mouthfeel. Glad I tried it, I don't think I'd seek it out again."
"From the 750 ml. bottle, 2011 batch dated 12-12-2016. Sampled on June 15, 2012. It pours an incredibly dark amber with red hues and a slightly cloudy appearance too. The soft, supple, off-white head lingers the whole time. The aroma is wonderful with its merger of Belgian yeast, Belgian candied sugar, dark malts, molasses, dark fruits, and maybe even a slight smoky note. The body is slick and in the medium to bold range. The taste is upfront candy sweet and malty with a quickly rising hop bitterness that lingers and becomes dry. An outstanding beer that was easily worth the $14 that I paid for it."
""
""
"O - This is a fantastic brew from Unibroue that only gets better as it warms, letting out its plethora of flavors. A bit expensive for a bottle (~$13), but if you like dark Belgian beers and are a fan of La Fin Du Monde, Maudite, or other Unibroue beers, this is a must."
""
"Overall an alright beer that is not worth the price point."
""
"Smells like banana bread with walnuts in it. Crazy. Theres a lot of yeasty breadiness maybe some raisins. The taste is hotter than expected but its very malty and slightly sweet. It said that its made to age and I agree. Id like to get another one to keep for 1.5-2 years. But probably wont, can always hope."
""
""
""
"What a great beer this is. Old ales usually have a lot a good aspects but one usually dominates the others. This beer has a great balance of all elements. With the complex tastes and smells there is little more one could ask for in a beer."
""
""
""
""
"O: A very spicy BSDA. I got some cinnamon and maybe even nutmeg, kinda like a BDSA/Winter Warmer mix in my mind. Complex and balanced. Sweet and malty. I enjoyed it a lot."
""
""
"I started out drinking this at cellar temp but it's way better room temperature. The yeast dominates and the oak is light but gives it a rustic edge. Very complex. Can't wait to pop open my other bottle in about 5 years or so."
""
"Unibroue 17 Grande Réserve, like the best examples of Belgian strong dark ales, has a complexity that even Stephen Hawking would have trouble getting his head around. It is somehow simultaneously sweet, spicy, savory and fruity. Strong yet easy to drink. Like so many Unibroue products, this can hold its own with any of the heavyweights in Belgium."
""
""
"O - Not bad but some features are really spoiling the experience, particularly the mouthfeel. In my opinion, this beer would benefit from a better drinkability and balance. I was hoping a lot but it came out to be disappointing."
""
""
"One of the better Belgian-inspired beers I've come across in quite some time. Vanilla, cola, caramel, and sugar are balanced against toasted oak, cinnamon, and clove. Earthy bitterness is mild but is supportive enough to hold up against the maltiness. Rich but not sweet. Strong but balanced. Alcohol is completely hidden. This is a seriously complex and dangerous ale. Completely worth the $12 for 750mL of beautiful beer."
"Picked this up during a trade with misterb303 while in Denver! Bottle #2011-118242. Cloudy mahogany pour with a creamy two finger head with decent retention and great lacing. Wonderful woody, spicy, complex nose. Lots of oak along with hints of dark fruit, toffee, caramel, vanilla, and just a touch of banana. The taste is just as big and just as complex. The oak is once again the star, with hints of nuts, raisins, black cherries, figs, tobacco, maple, vanilla, and brown sugar, with just a bit of cocoa, cinnamon, and booze. The mouthfeel starts off with moderate carbonation, but as it comes to temp, it becomes slightly chewy with a great subtle alcohol warming. Don't drink this too cold. This beer definitely lives up to the hype and I'd love to get my hands on another and leave it in the cellar for a while."
""
"Overall another fantastic offering from Unibroue. I wouldn't expect anything less from this brewery."
"Overall I am really glad I tried this one, mighty tasty. Unibroue never disappoints, if you haven't tried this I would highly recommend it. Would like to see how this one ages."
"Excellent mouthfeel. Above average thickness and carbonation but it's lighter and easier to drink than you'd think. You could drink it quickly despite the 10 ABV, or you could sip it slow and steady. I could drink this all day and night and will be on the lookout for more of it."
"O: Overall it is a very good beer, and it does taste more balanced than other Unibroue beers. I would drink it again, but it's not so fantastic that I would choose it over any other Belgian Dark, given the price."
"The liquorish that was in the original release is still there, but much more mellow. Complexities come out in spades, and a real treat. Highly recommended."
""
"Great beer with some cellar potential. Very smooth now but I would give it maybe a year or two for the light heat to mellow."

"DOA"
""
""
""
"M + D: A solid beer, well crafted and well balanced. The carbonation doesn't quite sparkle, but it does have a richness to it. A very satisfying brew from start to finish... outstanding!"
"The color is brown with some red on the edges. The head is beige color and disappear quite fast. The aroma is timid initially. Maybe the beer is too cold, I'll let it warm a little bit. After a little bit, I notice some notes of caramel malts, oak and dark fruits (blackberry and cherry). In the mouth, it is quite carbonated... just like all unibroue beers. Slightly spicy. Some other aspect found in the aroma are present in the mouth. This is a pretty decent beer from Unibroue. One of their best."
"Unibroue continues to impress me with this brew, great complexity, well concealed liquor, and it smells and tastes great. I preferred this to the aged original 17 I just had last week. It's my understanding that this on will come to Alberta in the future and I'll be buying several to age if it dose, for now I'm thanking liamt07 yet again for the opportunity"
""
"Smells of sour cherry and raisins with a little spice thrown in for good measure. Lots of malts. The taste is similar, with a strong sweetness showing through up front. Quite complex. It's quite fizzy as well, with a dry finish. Overall, I would buy more of these if they were easier to find. Damn good beer."
"I have to say it's been awhile since I have had a new Unibroue offering,back in the day I dranf alot of their offerings.Poured into a goblet a russet brown color with a nicely formed one finger off white head.Some phenolic spice and dark fruit in the nose.Yeasty and spiced phenols on the palate,the spice-like phenolic notes are big,some dark fruit and alcohol rounds out the palate.It's a good Belgian dark but I don't get much wood aged except in the finish wich is mild,in saying that it does meld well with the spiced yeasty notes of the beer."
""
"Rich, a Belgian like a wine. Well and complex malting. Not too sweet, very drinkable. Though not spicy, it has a richness of taste that was a mealin itself. Light chocolate, decent yeastability, better than Unibroue I have had.Dark thick brown, above average mouthfeel."
""
"Very tasty BSDA. Not overly fruity with prunes and raisins so it gets bonus points. Does have some earthy qualities. A re-make of their 17th aniversery brew, this is meant for some aging. I may plan on doing so."

"This was a smooth, very satisfying beer. Would drink it anytime."
"overall: great stuff - no surprise from unibroue"
"O: Pretty amazing, certainly deserving of its accolades, smooth, delicious, and fragrant, can't wait to open my second bottle in a few years"
""
"Poured a twany brown with decent head on top of a dark and tropical fruit aroma, some very noticeable yeast along with sugary goodness and that touch of orange/citric spice along with spices. Smooth, semi-creamy medium body that has a fuller mouthfeel thanks to that distinct yeast. This beer has a crackle to it thanks to some lively spices that are peppery and clove-like and there are plenty of fruit flavors. There's an easy to spot orange/banana like citric taste, as well as some black cherry or figs for a dark fruit taste and then there's fruits across the board like apple and grape that I pick up here and there. Well-balanced between this fruits and some spicy and sweet malty goodness, the beer has a lively finish thanks to some good carbonation as well and is a very enjoyable sipper."
"A ponderous beer, says it's best before 12-12-2016, I'm sure this will age nicely, not too shabby as it is now, but I was hoping for given its Grande Reserve handle..."
""
""
"O: a very good beer, not quite the bold level of their other offerings but the subtleties are nice and it's still enjoyable"
""
""
"Overall - Good, but nothing special compaired to the rest of unibroues' ales. I was expecting a little more oaked flavor, but this is closer to a dry wine. I think if any other brewery made this it would be great, but this is just more of the same high standard from unibroue. Since its limited its for sure worthy of trying."
""
"O: love these guys - have never had a bad Unibroue - all Unibroue beers have a certain yeasty/malty (?) flavor aspect that sets them apart from all other brewers. However, honestly, the other beers in their line (La Fin du Monde, Maudite, & Trois Pistoles all come to mind) are all so good that I'm not sure this is necessarily a better beer, but it is certainly equally classy and full of character."
""
"B-"
"Overall: Enjoyable, especially if you like Unibroue's regular lineup (mildly backhanded compliment). Interesting beer, with flashes of brilliance (the restrained oak influence, the clove/dark fruit interplay, the bold aroma). Nowhere near great, but I like it very much."

"Overall: Really tasty and complex beer. I think less (or no) spice additions would help this out, as would some additional time in the bottle."
""
""
""
""
""
"Even the tannin woods play on the flavor profile with a spicy oak taste and a somewhat dryish astringency that creates a slight powdery texture to accompany wood spice and sweetness. This Grand Reserve is a masterful beer that deserves much praise- certainly in the upper echelon of the Unibroue staple."

"O: A ridiculously complex, delicious beer. Very very happy I got to try this."
"It'd be interesting with some age on it, or back-to-back with the original for comparison."
"Bottle: Poured a deep brown color ale with a large foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma consists of spices (white pepper, coriander) with some notes of Unibroue yeast and butterscotch. Taste is also a mix between some Unibroue yeast with a great spice mix and some butterscotch malt. I thought it lacked some dry fruits characteristics and while carbonation was excellent it appears that the body is thinner then their usual offering."
"Very glad that they brewed this one again. This is a great beer and the oak is done very nicely. It is subtle enough so that even if you are not typically a fan of barrel-aged beers, this one could be for you. Reminds me of the Pannepot lineup, but the wood is not nearly as obvious as on the Reserva or Grand Reserva. Very good beer."
"Deep brown, one finger of tan head, some lace left on the glass. Smell is full of dark fruit soaked in alcohol, raisin and plum come to mind, dark bread scents, yeasty, lots of fruit in here, alcohol, ever so light notes of oak/wood. Taste follows the nose in the sense that dark fruit in alcohol are very present, yeasty, overripe plums, grapes and raisin, light oak aftertaste with faint banana candy flavours as well. Med carbonation, full body, silky feeling and very smooth. This is a fine specimen, a truly delicious brew worthy of its distinction."
"This was quite nice at its young age--complex, well-balanced and not overly sweet or yeasty. Time should do only great things for this beer so I look forward to revisiting it again."
"Drinkability: It's a smooth drinkable beer accompanied with great flavors and aromas. Another great from Unibroue!"
"Overall a really complex and tasty brew - definitely unique"
"Poured a deep mahogany, lightly purplish. A big cream coloured head is formed. Nose has some light grape, dark fruits, sugary with a slight vanilla note. Taste has alcohol soaked dark fruits, dark syrupy and lightly sugary notes, Unibroue house yeast is completely evident here. Almost reminiscent of Trois Pistoles in some senses. Light and active carbonation upfront but smooths out as the sip progresses (something I find with all Unibroue beers). Very nice but not exceptional. Not alot of the oak aging is evident here, and if it is, it must be very subtle."
"Overall, quite nice. Solidly executed, and very enjoyable to drink."
"D: Very Unibroue, very good. I will be picking up and stocking a few more of these bottles to enjoy over the spring & summer. Very happy I had the opportunity to try this."
"O/D - A fairly solid BSDA. Not what I was expecting. I wanted something great, but for some reason I think Unibroue's yeast got in the way again. Aside from that it's a great, very drinkable and enjoyable one from Unibroue. At $10 I don't think I would reach for it often, but the three others in the cellar will be for special occasions. The smoothness makes this an 'A' beer."
"O- This really is heavenly. I can see why they brought this back and I'm glad they did."
"M - Medium body, chewy. Light carbonation."
