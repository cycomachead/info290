4.62,14.4,4.25,4.75,4.75,4.25,4.5,"An expensive, rich, and complex brew. At an 18% ABV and a $10.00 a bottle price, you'll want to savor every sip. Enjoyed from the 12 oz. bottle, it is best just slightly warmer than refrigerator temperature to get full benefit. Obviously extraordinary, well worth the investment.","edentonbill","Saturday at 06:08 PM"

I figured the raisins would make this a soupy sweet mess but it actually balances nicely with the big brown ale and Belgian notes to make a very unique beer. That being said I think if they dialed it back a bit it would be a better beer that could be balanced beautifully and still be unique. Is it somewhat gimmicky? Yes. Would I pick it up again? Probably not. But it's a unique experience and seeing very talented brewers push the limits is always fun. It's definitely worth the experience even if it's not one I would repeat.","BergBeer","0"

4.03,-0.2,4,4,4,4.25,4,"Overall I thought this was a good beer and a good example of the style, it had everything that I expected and it lived up to being a bigger and bolder version of the original, it's like they took all the aspects that I liked about the original and made them bigger and bolder and I thought that worked out nicely, especially with the alcohol being really well hidden.  This beer had nice drinkability, it was smooth, a little warming, not too crisp, the alcohol was really well hidden, sticky, a little filling and the taste did a good job of holding my attention, I think one is the perfect amount for me, I might be able to drink two since the alcohol is really well hidden, but I know I would regret it.  What I like the most about this beer was how well the raisins were showcased and how well the alcohol was hidden, to me those were the highlights of this beer.  What I like the least about this beer was nothing, there wasn't anything I disliked or would change, but it would be nice if it was just a a couple dollars cheaper.  I would buy this beer when it's released again, I already got two more for the cellar so I can see how they age.  I would recommend this beer, especially if you like big bold beers with lots of dark fruit flavors.  All in all I was happy with this beer and a little impressed with it, I was pretty sure this was going to be a sweet booze bomb and that just wasn't the case.  IT's one of the better Dogfish Head beers I've had and it's my new favorite beer that's brewed with raisins.  Good job guys, this was one tasty brew, keep up the hard work.","StoutHunter","Feb 10, 2015"

4.05,0.2,4,4,4,4,4.25,"this is excellent beer, cant believe i have never had it until now, its so good. color is lighter than expected, deep caramel with some red hues, but not brown, or not as brown as i thought it might be, and it holds a pretty good head, not looking thick at all for a beer thats almost 20% abv. it smells great too, the booze is there for sure, but there is more to it than that for certain. it has dark fruit, dates or figs dried, that has to be the raisin, although i cant place it exactly. the raw sugar unrefined sweetness is there too. the flavor is great, folds and wrinkles of grain and sugar, less chocolate and roast than expected, almost none at all, and the sugar here is more like honey than anything else, really nice as well. the booze is warming, but not caustic like it is in some other huge dogfish brews, its almost complimentary to the sugar, mellowing it, and to the raisins, making it feel more like a rum based desert than a beer, which is cool. nice winter beer, i would be curious to see how it ages. the base beer still stands as one of my favorites, and this one is a nice amplification of all that is good in the original. worth trying, absolutely. i had no problem with a bottle to myself. i was also surprised how well carbonated it was, usually these get pretty still at a certain strength, nice touch.","StonedTrippin","Feb 01, 2015"

The aroma is big and rich, malty with deep fruit and brown sugar. The taste is equally robust and actually more-so. A little bit of alcohol adds to its appeal, which is impressive since its 18% ABV. You won't taste it but you will feel it. The body is thick on the palate and smooth throughout.

My past experience with other high ABV brews is they tend to mellow out and take on a  much smoother flavor with a few years in the cellar. This is a great candidate for both of those traits.

It was aged nicely (although can't compare it fresh) and was significantly better then Raison D'etre which I'm not a huge fan of. I'm not overly a huge fan of Dogfish Head overall but their high abv beers are awesome for aging and this beer definitely can hold up for a long time. I'm sure it would still be good with 10-15 years on it.","jaasen64","Nov 10, 2013"

Decent head at pour that dissipated very quickly to almost non-existent. The aroma is heavy raison and alcohol - smells like a fine port wine. Taste is luscious - again heavy raison, prune, brown sugar sweetness, and alcohol heat on the back end. Despite the lack of head/lacing left, there is still a fizzy carbonation tingle in the mouth. A perfect brew for a fall day.","Oakenator","Sep 24, 2012"

Pours extremely hazy dark reddish brown color with a small foamy khaki head with poor retention, that reduces to a small patch of foam. Minimal wisps of lacing on the glass. Aromas of huge raisin, caramel, molasses, toffee, prune, tobacco, earth, toast, roast, and yeast spices. Fantastic aromas with awesome complexity and balance. No booze to speak of as well. Taste of big raisin, prune, molasses, caramel, toffee, toast, tobacco, roast, earth, and yeast spices. Lingering notes of dark fruit, molasses, toffee, caramel, tobacco, toast, roast, and earth on the finish for a good bit. Great flavor complexity and balance; with zero cloying sweetness on the finish. Also slightly dry surprisingly. Light carbonation and full bodied; with a creamy, slick, and thick mouthfeel that is very nice. Alcohol is insanely well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a fantastic Belgian strong ale! Huge complexity and balance of flavors; and surprisingly smooth to sip on slowly for an 18% beer. Highly enjoyable stuff.","superspak","Sep 22, 2012"

The amazing part is the difference between the first pour and the second. I tried the first ""clear"" pour and then my second half of the bottle, and for me the second part tasted fuller and richer. This may have something to do with the overwhelming cloudiness and sediment that was lying in this 7+ year old beast. I've heard a lot of rumors about the sediment enhancing the flavors over time, and this one is certainly is an exceptional example of that. Smooth, rich, and an overall winner with this one. Looking forward to the '07 and the other '05 I have waiting in the wings. Thanks for reading my first review while I'm drunk on my birthday BA'S.","Nickfellow007","Jan 22, 2012"

Raisins are the first taste, followed by malt and the finish is slightly boozy. To be expected from 18% alch. LOVED this brew. The combination of Raisins and malt paired with age have really made this a standout beer for myself. I wish I had more to cellar and see what the outcome is.

Sweet and sugary, with high alcohol presence, though it doesn't necessarily feel like 18%. An interesting brew. There is no way I would drink an entire bottle of this.

There's also a small mound of solid chunks gathered at the bottom of my glass... lovely The nose is heavy on toffee and caramelized brown sugar, with a prominent raisin component as well. The flavor profile steps up the dark fruits, taking what was present in the nose and adding layers of date and fig. Unfortunately oxidation is creeping in a bit too heavy at this point, with a wet cardboard taste. I'm quite impressed with how middling the body is for a beer this size. It's not as well attenuated as many Belgian styles, but it's not nearly as heavy as I was expecting for a beer this high in alcohol. The carbonation is also still pretty solid, though a bit more liveliness would really top things off nicely. This bottle of '07 Raison D'extra was pretty good, but I think at just over 4 years old it might be past its peak.","axeman9182","Mar 06, 2011"

This is a really delicious brew that is let down by the aftertaste. This beer is super thick and syruppy.

Was too excited for this one when I got it and let it chill for a little bit and sipped from a snifter... There were plenty of settled bits that were kicked up in the glass and made me weary about the quality of the brew but the aroma, although very strong with alcohol was something that I personally found very nice... Sipped over the period of about an hour or so and flavor tones that were not there in the beginning started to come out as it started to warm...

The taste follows pretty closely, with notes of raisins, figs, oak, whiskey, cran-cherry, and, again, a healthy alcoholic burn.

Let's just say the face she made was priceless. She passes the glass my way and I get a nose full of sweet raisons and a bourbon like aroma. It's sugary sweet to say the least. The flavor is similar to the nose. Sweet with a deep raison flavor that's almost overbearing. The high ABV can be tasted in the bourbon like flavor that resounds with every sip. The warming sensation is much so much like whiskey it's rediculous. Full body with almost no carbonation. This is a sipper for sure.

This is a very interesting aroma. The taste is more port-like than the aroma. It isn't an identical twin, but it has a lot of similarities. There is a lot of molasses, some spice, raisins, and some alcohol heat. Again, this is very interesting taste. The mouthfeel is full bodied with a velvety texture, and lively carbonation (a lot livelier than I would expect from a beer with strong, and aged for two years). Overall, I like this beer. The taste and aroma aren't what I usually like in a strong Belgian ale, or a port, or an extreme beer.

Flavors are all of the above dark fruits, with only the most subtle alcohol and a good offering of burned brown sugar. A bit sweet for me, but still good.

Extremely potent sweetness which could be a bit much for some people. Its like drinking a chocolate raspberry cake, very dense and very boozey. Mouth is very thick and syrupy. The sweetness has a real presence in the mouth. Overall its pretty awesome if you like sweet stuff.. It is certainly an experience to try, but the sweetness will definitely become overpowering.

Brown sugar, turbinado, and fruit was in the forefront. Hops were very subdued and did not play much of a roll in this beer.

It's a delicious blend of raisins, dried apricots, caramel, cedar wood, toasted chestnuts, and some kick-you-in-the-teeth-hops. It has similar flavors to the Raison D'etre, but with the potency of a 120-minute IPA. Totally overwhelms the entire palate, makes your tongue feel as if it's been soaking in marinade for days. Every sip is a lot to handle, and requires about a 45-second recovery time before the next. It's definitely a slow-sipper, and not an every-day kind of beer.

And that is all that I could smell. I took me a while to drink this beer. One small sip at a time. I bought it thinking that it was around 9% or so. and while drinking it I just thought it was not a very good attempt at making a great beer. Now that I realize that it is 20%, I stand corrected. I don't think I'll have another, but I would suggest it if you are fan of high abv beers and have an educated palate.

It definitely warms as it goes down-warmth in the throat-and one can also tell when it hits the stomach-warmth and weight there. Unlike a wine or mead it is heavy on the palate, however, like a wine or mead it has an aura to it of being uncarbonated, yet it is. Wine is an uncarbonated beverage, yet whilst sipping it one can feel slight carbonation on the tongue (white wine in my example, esp. riesling.), it is the same with this beer, one feels the carbonation but it really doesn't bring attention to itself. Very cool. Finishes a bit dry, leaving the tongue with an almost swollen feeling. Alcohol tingles on the lips, just a bit though. This is one that I cannot possibly see drinking more than one possible, I mean in one sitting, if you drink more than one youll be plastered, and maybe even sick.

Flavors of rum soaked raisons, English toffee and jam packed with bitter hops that is counter weighted with tons of dark caramel malt. This is a very weighted and saturated product that may be more of a showpiece of inventive beer making rather than a true beverage of pleasure.","barknee","0"

There is a bit of lacing. The beer is characterized as a strong Belgian, which I think is a bit of a misnomer, in that barleywine is more apt for what you will experience. The smell is very rich, very full, and just deep fruits, such as raisin, fig, grape skins, and apricot. There is a slight medicinal smell to this beer too, and given its overall complexity, maybe there is some medicinal properties to what you will imbibe. The consistency is full bodied and then some, with a syrupy thickness that is reminiscent of high ABV barley wines, or from the vinous family of ice wines. The taste is just sweetness, syrupy malty sweetness, with the deep fruits and warming alcohol notes. Given its huge ABV content, they did a nice job of masking things over. You won't get too much of that throaty burn, but rather the warming notes of other high ABV ales. The mouthfeel is syrupy and the aftertaste is of the lingering warmining alcohol. This is a sipping beer if there ever was one. I could not imagine taking this any other way. Drink this one like wine and heed the high ABV. L'Chaim.","albern","Dec 28, 2007"

Besides that (which seems to calm down as time goes on), you get a slight yeast and a lot of alcohol. But the presence of the raisin skins seems to be sticking around a good bit. Flavor is extremely sweet...I mean way sweet. Too much so I think. Almost tastes like straight sugar water (or simple syrup for the mixologists out there) was mixed in with it. Feel is thick and syrup like. Personally I think it is a bit too far beyond what it should be. This is drinkable, yes. A very nice, different brew.

It smells like raisins, figs, brown sugar and rum. Aroma is nice and sweet. Taste is similar to the aroma, it's malty sweet. It sure doesn't taste like it's 20% ABV. You can taste the alcohol, but it's not overpowering at all. Mouthfeel/body is medium/full, it's syrupy and smooth. It also leaves a good coating in the mouth. Drinkability is pretty good. The smoothness and low carbonation makes this go down pretty easy. Alcohol isn't as noticable as you'd think for a beer this strong. It's definitely a sipping beer, but it is easy to drink.

Alcohol comes on strong with this one and leaves a warm trail all the way down to the stomach. The mouthfeel is syrupy and very still. This is classified as a Belgian Strong Dark Ale but it has barleywine written all over it. The drinkability has got to be low. Sorry guys, but it is just way too strong and way too sweet to have more than one. Not necessarily a minus given the style, but there's no getting around it.

I made sure to pour aggressively enough to ensure good head, but as soon as I finished the pour the head began to madly and loudly sizzle down and completely disappear (it is absolutely gone). The head less body is warm purple ruby red with wonderful gradation in tone. Smell is of dates sort of jam like, molasses, there is also that sort of raisin straw sweetness that comes from sugary raisins. I can only detect the slightest hop aroma; it is very much over welled by malty rich sugary fruit esters. Alcohol is present in the nose, more so than the 120 minute, but not over welling or too cloying. Taste is big and aggressive; lots of sweet flavor with that back end of slightly earthy bitterness that reminds me of eating big juicy candied or dark raisons that have sort of a sugary reduced tar like feel. The alcohol does not really enter in the flavor until the finish and right before that the raisin character runs in and exposes its self. There is definite alcohol warmth on this bad ass, in that sort of fun and yet dangerous way. Obviously not a session-able beer, but definitely worth experiencing and maybe even worth keeping a couple around for a special occasion.

There's a strong raisin presence, obviously, as well as plum and caramel notes. Mouthfeel is medium full with low carbonation. Taste is very fruity sweet. Raisins, plums, and berries make a strong impression, with some caramel and toffee underneath.

Sweet with raisin, cherry and molasses flavors on a ponderous platform of malt and fruit. The huge abv is detected, but, somehow, does not overwhelm the flavors. Perhaps more like port than beer - this is a snifter sipper. I paid what I thought an outrageous price for a single bottle, but, on splitting it four ways, this turned out to be just the right amount, and, on a per-serving basis, not unreasonable at all.

If you get your nose deep into the beer you can actually feel the alcohol burn. Lets see if the taste reflects that. The taste...well yes it is HOT. I am glad I got to try this fresh but man it could really use 4-5 years. It is also very sweet. It does maintain that belgian ale like flavor but wow is it sweet. The mouthfeel is more than full bodied. It sticks to your mouth. It is almost syrupy. The carbonation is in there; noticable and lively...not too bad. Overall, well its not the most drinkable beer, but there is certainly nothing offensive about it. I could really see myself saving some and enjoying it once or twice a year when the temperature really drops but it certainly is not a daily beer or even a weekly or monthy one for that matter.

The taste is huge, which is to be expected with a 20% beer. Lost of sweet malts and candied fruits, which makes it almost like a quad. The second set of taste is more of the same fruits, and a delightful bit of carbonation that lets the sweet taste dance on your tongue, then cruely takes it away.

It's pleasant, but then, I'm not sure what I was expecthing out of this beer. The flavor roughly matches the aroma, with an alcohol upfront and then an oak-vanilla-raisin hint under.

Initial aroma shows a little bit of prunes and raisins along with a big helping of grain alcohol. There is also a red wine like tart cherry sweetness mixed in with the big alcohol aroma. The alcohol in the aroma subsides or I become numb to it further in allowing a floral-perfumy cherry sweetness and more of the rich sugariness but still just a little bit of raisins. Taste is where the raisins come thru, a big, rich sugary raisin flavor along with some caramel. The alcohol is also more evident at first in the taste as a nice spicy burn, but eventually mellows to a warmth in the throat. Not overly thick for its strength. This beer while it may not rate as high for me in aroma or appearance is incredible where taste is concerned.

Red grapes and ripe plums form the middle before the dry, lasting mildly bitter alcoholic finish. You can taste the booze. Nearly all carbonation is lost at this point, which is fine of course, though there is the slightest hint in the throat as it goes down. In summary: brown sugar, fruit, booze. And lots of it. This is a serious sippin' beer, and an extremely delicious one at that. Completely reaffirming the fact that DFH's really strong-ass beers are pure magic with just a little age on them.

No head, though, which is a problem appearance-wise and aroma-wise. The aroma is nonetheless pretty strong, with lots of rich burnt sugar smells and some sweet dried fruit and peppery alcohol underneath. The taste is a sugar bomb, unadulterated sweetness with nothing to modify or deepen it. Huge candi sugar up front with some fruit notes behind, underpinned by a big raw alcohol burn.

There's a bit of fruitiness in there (I can't say it's raisins) that tastes like it was soaked in alcohol and dipped in sugar. Thick slick mouthfeel. Boy this thing warms. It's like sipping on a snifter of brandy. If it wasn't $10 a bottle I'd like to try this one a bit warm a la Gran Marnier.

The aroma is all malt, caramel, figs, and some wine/sherry notes (fresh grapes, a little black cherry). The taste has a lot of fruit. More black cherry, some sherry, dare I say a little raisin.

The taste is quite sweet, yet still fairly light on the palate, though it is certainly a bit syrup like. The beer has quite a fruity taste to it, with lots of notes of concentrated grape (almost has notes of a desert wine), a bit of candied orange peel. This beer is still fairly drinkable, despite the high alcohol; it is definitely a sipper, but it does not become too much beer after a couple of ounces like the 120 min.

Molasses sweetness and lots of crystal malt with a very well hidden sting of alcohol. The mouthfeel is very thick and the drinkability is deadly smooth for the alcohol level.","clvand0","Oct 14, 2005"
4.32,6.9,4,4.5,4,4,5,"Pours a deep amber color, crystal cleer, with just a light hint of head that leaves just a small ring around the top. Nose is not nearly as strong as I expected. I get deep raison and fig soaked in rum, deep brown-sugary sweetness. I really expected this to kick my ass more. Flavor is really smooth. Lots of sweetness, brown sugar and caramel, with raison and just a touch of alcohol. Wow. Very nice. Feel is syrupy and thick with minimal carbonation. I get a nice warming in my stomach. I'm very very surprised at the drinkability of this one. I was expecting something that would be hard to finish, but I'm finding myself having to slow down a little. I'm definately sipping, but going back sooner than other beers of this magnitude. This is a really nice beer. I will enjoy a few more of these before too long.","kmpitz2","Oct 07, 2005"

4.2,4,4,4,4.5,4,4,"The beer pours a dark amber/brown color with a thin offwhite head that fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a warm and rich crystal malt and molasses scent with a mild raisin aroma to boot. It is sweet with an alcohol bang. The taste is intense. It has a rich crystal malt and raisin flavor with the residual sweetness of the molasses. It goes down slow and warm. It's flavor is quite complex and so flavorful. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a damn tastey brew, but to be honest, I'll probably never buy this again. It's one of those, I had to try it; I liked it, but it's too damned over the top to drink too often.","WesWes","Oct 05, 2005"

Soaked grapes, sherry and figs, plus an earthy vegetal oil bring on coniferous flavours and a rather complex perfumey profile. Plenty of residual sugar still, makes you wonder how much cane sugar, corn syrup, molasses etc they had to throw into every bottle. Long aggressive palate. It really does remind me or vegetal oil alcohol soaked. Interesting green olives complexities, apples, grapes, apricot lingering sweetness. Overwhelming ethanol finish. Long long aftertaste, hoppy and somehow yeasty. Softly carbonated, rather thin-bodied.","Rastacouere","Apr 05, 2005"

4.17,3.2,4,4.5,4,4.5,4,"Ive been sitting on this bottle for two years. It seemed appropriate to welcome a new year and to celebrate my 500th review with this one. Presentation: A corked 750 ml bottle with a dog-faced, bowler wearing ruffian on the label. Stamped onto the bottle is the date Dec 19, 2002. No audible pop from the removal of the cork. Pours a murkey russet color with a thin, wispy head. I find the head remarkable, considering the ABV. The aroma is malt and alcohol, in interchangeable order.I found it more reminiscent of a barleywine than a Belgian ale. Underneath the alcohol and malt are aromas of raisins, plums, sugar, cherries, and fresh-cut wood. Taste is dominated by the alcohol, but malt and yeast and sugar shine through as well. Its surprisingly drinkable for such an alcohol monster.and not really harsh at all. Its not exactly complexthe alcohol gives it a one dimentional feel, and the aromas fade away in the taste. Full bodied, and moderate to light carbonation (surprisingly). Id love to try one when its five or ten years oldthis was smooth and enjoyable. Its perfect on a dreary early January day. Its not a world-class beer, by any means, but for what it is, its remarkably good.","Suds","Jul 19, 2004"
4,-1,4,4,4,4,4,"Poors with a deep, dark body with little head, color between a dark brown and a ruby red. Slight lacing. Heavy sweet aromas, somewhere between a port wine and a mild rum, with a bit of smokiness around the edges. The taste is a little less fruity than the aroma, with more maltiness and yeast flavors rounding out the fruitiness. Very complex and flavorful for such a high-ABV beer. Mouthfeel is heavy, and clingy, without being overly syrupy. Similar to a good dessert wine. Very pleasant and drinkable.","kaszeta","Feb 09, 2004"

Not much of a head forms, but some white bubbles sling to the sides of my glass, leaving a miniscule amount of lace, that is gone shortly. The aromas are heavy and hit hard with anything and everything from leather, alcohol (rum, whiskey, etc), smoke, tobacco, spices, deep roasted malts, various types of belgian yeast and candy sugars, and more. The taste is rugged and strong yet smooth and refined. The malt massacre is heavy up front, with some interesting flavors blending together in the middle before unleashing a very boozy, spicy finish on your throat/stomach. The mouthfeel is thick and syrupy, and borders on cloying and the drinkability is good for a 20% brew...another winner from DFH! Bring on the aprihop!","francisweizen","Jan 01, 2004"

Pours a dark amber color with a very thin light beige head. No real lacing to speak of. Flavor is huge and promising up front, but something seems to be missing in the end. It's like reading a really good book only to find out the last couple of pages have been torn out. Flavors of malt, raisins, alcohol (rum) and caramel peter out as the alcohol overshadows the flavor by the end of the glass. Finish seems to be lacking the hops necessary to reign in all the brash flavors that are roaming around.

It is sweet, complex, and explosive to the tongue.  Raisons, beet sugar, and molassas... yes lots of molasses and lots of yeast.  i talked to the boys for quite a while while holding on to their table and was explained too... they add  a bunch of molassas and a buch of yeast to punch this thing up to 20%ABV.  i rated it high for what it is (push the envelope) but it is not very drinkable.

Smell of cooked/burnt raisins, currants and dates. The taste is actually a more subtle version of their Raison D'etre, almost like a barleywine (which is how some other, less informed sites are categorizing this brew; I'm calling it an experiment). At 20%, you'd expect the alcohol to be overwhelming. It's not. In fact, on the whole this is an incredibly balanced brew, not nearly as heavy as you might expect.
