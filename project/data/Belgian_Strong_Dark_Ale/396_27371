The aroma is very subdued but I detect dark Belgian candy sugar and sweet dark malt.  The flavor much more aggressive than the nose implies.  There is a large concentration of dark Belgian candy sugarand sweet,dark malt. Belgian yeast gives it a tart acidic red wine edge.  The mouth is warm with alcohol and moderately carbonated.","Franziskaner","Friday at 07:58 PM"

Pours crystal clear reddish brown color with a 1 finger fairly dense cream colored head with good retention, that reduces to a thin lace cap that lingers. Light spotty lacing clings on the glass, with some moderate streaming carbonation. Aromas of raisin, prune, banana, grape, clove, caramel, dark candi sugar, toast, bubblegum, and earthy yeast esters. Very nice aromas with good balance of fruity/spicy yeast esters with candi sugar maltiness. Taste of raisin, prune, banana, grape, clove, caramel, dark candi sugar, bubblegum, toast, and yeast earthiness. Lingering notes of dark and light fruits, clove, caramel, dark candi sugar, bubblegum, toast, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and complexity of fruity/lightly spicy esters with malt sweetness; and almost zero cloying sweetness present after the finish. Medium carbonation and fairly full bodied; with a slick, lightly syrupy, and lightly prickly mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is well hidden with only a small warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice Belgian strong dark ale. Very nice complexity of fruity/spicy yeast esters with candi sugar sweetness; and quite smooth to sip on. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Apr 24, 2013"

3.25,-19.8,3.5,3.5,3,4,3,"Overall this is just a miss for me because of the lack-luster complexity and overwhelmingly dominant Belgian yeast flavors.

No real hop presence unlike most AleSmith offerings. Very satisfying.","nickd717","Aug 23, 2011"

3.86,-4.7,3,4.5,3.5,4,4,"Very hazy walnut brown, with cinnamon, sepia, and orange in the spectrum. The head is pathetic, ivory-beige, fizzy, and frail - for a Belgian style, pretty unacceptable. The aroma, however, is very attractive - vanilla, toffee, raisin, apricot, hazelnut, maple, armagnac, and banana bread notes make this a joy to sniff. Deeply fruity and complex. The flavor disappoints after such a good nose, full and subtle yet somehow shallow. Crab apple and hawthorn, brandy, honey, trappist yeast, pears, and leafy hops make this a respectable pastiche of a classic Belgian quadrupel, but it falls short in terms of complexity and mellow drinkability. Soft, rolling carbonation makes this a nice, sippable full-bodied ale, but it is nothing outstanding.","soulgrowl","Jul 05, 2011"
3.88,-4.2,4,3.5,4,4,4,"O - This is a good beer, but I honestly expected a bit more from Alesmith.

4.42,9.1,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Alesmith's Grand Cru poured out as a really nice reddish brown color, the head was white and pretty thick looking. There was a bit of lacing on the glass after each sip. I let this one sit for just a few moments before i dove into it. I wanted to let it warm up a little before my first time. The aroma of the beer had just a slight funk or tartness to it otherwise it was pretty hoppy and had some nice earth tones to it. The taste was much better than I expected. I was thinking it was going to be a sour ale of some kind, but it turned out to be a really nice blend of something like a brown ale with an IPA and then a touch of sour in the faint distance. The mouthfeel was smooth and very easy to drink, even though I tried making mine last a while by sipping it. Overall I found this beer to be quite impressive and enjoyed it a lot.

3.88,-4.2,4,3.5,3.5,5,4.5,"From a 750 mL brown champagne bottle served at cellar temperature, where it has been quietly waiting for a year. Brewed with imported malts and hops, dark candi sugar and Trappist yeast; bottle-conditioned with no vintage date. Pours cherry brown, punctuated with particulates, and heavy carbonation which builds and subsequently replenishes a finger of off-white head that leaves a bit of lacing. Smells pleasant, with whiffs of apples, plums, raisins, caramel and perhaps some hops. Plums, grapes and their dried counterparts on the palate combine with dark malts, crisp red apples, light phenols and floral/spicy hops which contribute a mild bitterness. Nearly hot with ethanol, and there are prevalent rosy/floral and solventy fusels which lend a noticeable sweetness. However, the high carbonation and well-attenuated body help to counter the sweetness and dry the beer right back out. It may not be the most complex Belgian, and the higher alcohols can be distracting, but this is still a pretty decent brew that is dangerously drinkable. A good beer for the cellar, as I feel this one could age for years and years.","mmmbeer","Feb 15, 2011"

The alcohol content is fairly apparent (read: you can tell there's a smidge, but not necessarily that it's a 10% smidge), and the carbonation seems to me to interfere with the taste. Considering that I don't like its taste as much as I was hoping (and that I want to try other beers in this style), it is still surprisingly drinkable...

3.85,-4.9,4,4,4,3.5,3.5,"Reviewed from notes for #150. Pours a light brown with a 1/4 finger head into my Chimay goblet. The head is light tan and has no real retention. Clouds of foam coat the top of the beer as with many other Belgian beers I have had. The beer is very cloudy, presumably from yeast floating in suspension. In the nose I get notes of fruits like apples and raisins, yeasty breadiness and a tiny pinch of alcohol. Pretty much smells like a typical Belgian, good nose. I would like a tiny bit more strength on it though. The taste is also very fruity. Apples, raisins and cherries come to mind the most, it is fruity but in a tasteful way, not like a fruit beer. Caramel/light malts back up the fruit and Belgian yeast and spices come into play with this. A good mix for an American made Belgian style beer. The mouthfeel is a bit watery/light for the big flavors. A bit of alcohol warming (well hidden) and low carbonation. The low carbonation suits the flavor pretty well. Coat of fruit/malts stays on the tongue. The price (in Boston) that I paid was a bit much for this beer but it is not a bad example of a Belgian style made in America. I prefer the other Alesmith beers and will continue to support their company. Will probably only try this one again if I somehow see it on tap.","cbutova","Jan 04, 2010"

4,-1.2,4,4,4,4,4,"Out of a 750ml capped bottle. Pours a clear ruby brown color with honey highlights, an off-white head with medium sized carbonation bubbles which settle into a light cap. The aroma is of bananas and clove from the Belgian yeast, some candi sugar and honeysuckle. The taste starts off with a big hit of coriander, some candied cherries and dark candi sugar. There is also some light banana and clove as well as an odd rust flavor. The feel is moderate with very fizzy carbonation, finishes sweet. A very solid BSDA. A little heavy on the coriander for my liking but the ABV is kept in check as well as the sweetness. This is very well made American made BSDA. Good job.","Gmann","Dec 23, 2009"

Wonderfully complex aroma of dark candi sugar, toffee, fruity notes of berries, and some cinnamon. The flavor is sweet and is dominated by toffee, with some vanilla dried fruit as well. I was looking for a little more balance and complexity, but it is still pretty nice. Full, almost chewy body is a bit heavy, but the ample amount of silky carbonation lets it move over the tongue well enough to avoid any excessive, cloying stickiness. Pretty nice beer, though missing some yeasty complexities that I look for in the style that would make it stand out. At the premium price it commands, I probably wont be buying this in the future.","bulletrain76","Dec 14, 2009"

It's not perfect and falls a little short of the world's finest BSDAs, but it's not far off. Perhaps a stronger nose and more body would elevate it to that status. I'm really impressed with Grand Cru though. This is great beer. If you have the opportunity, you'd be remiss to pass it up. Honestly, this is one of the better American BSDAs I've encountered.

Overall this had a nice smell and taste and body, making it an all-around good beer. It hid the alcohol fairly well, so it was easy to drink, but preferable to sip to fully enjoy. Not sure about aging ability. I'm sure it could last, but I'm not sure if it would improve. AleSmith makes some of the most amazing beer, and while this was far from bad, it didn't blow me away.

4.17,3,4,4.5,4,4.5,4,"Thanks to jamescrames for the awesome trade which included this bad boy. Into my favorite snifter it pours dark brown in with cherry hues on the edge. A diminutive bubbly tan head exits quickly, leaving a smattering of dots all around the glass. Smell is complex and bold with cherries, phenols, earthy hops, sweet malts and vinegar all working in concert. Some subtle pears and other light fruits exist in the extreme back. Taste isn't quite as complex, but remains intriguing with ripened dark fruits, spice, malts and an ascetic undercurrent. Mouth-feel is smooth, and would almost be silky if not for the ubiquitous hop bite and alcohol heat. Body lies just on the heavy side of medium, and the carbonation is mild. After it warms it becomes a little creamier going down, and I can begin to feel the alcohol warmth in my stomach, which is a really nice feeling. I'm sure a more refined palate than mine could find something noteworthily wrong with this brew, but I sure can't.","stephens101","Sep 17, 2009"

The taste is very vinous, with some malt backing it up, and a little Belgian yeast characteristic mixed in, though not as prominent in most Belgian style beers.

I need to make another trip to OH in order to pick up a 2nd Speedway to review (awesome but consumed during my reviewing break)...and I need to try other Alesmith Brews.

The aroma is a soft, clean, and persistent mix of jammy fruit and some kind of sugary syrup I can't place. The flavor is packed with more jammy fruit, brandy, light caramel perhaps, and some yeast and alcohol show up on the finish. The flavors are intense yet it somehow finishes lighter and more delicate than the start. There is good length on the finish, but it seems to gracefully lift away off the tongue so as not to be cloying. Great.","dedrinker","Aug 02, 2008"

This particular sample isn't exhibiting the effervescence from the secondary fermentation that is described on the bottle. I like the flavor and I fully intend on stocking up on these on my next trip to Table & Vine, but i can't say that its true to style or not.

The tan foam is about 1/2 inch thick and settles pretty quickly despite a high degree of carbonation present. I like the contrast between the ruby hue of the beer and the almost brown color of the head. The nose is an astringent mix of plum, raisin, caramel, and strong alcohol with a lightly charred character. Much of the same fruity malt and alcoholic burn in the taste. The flavor also seems to have a decent hoppy balance giving it a slight bitter finish. The strength of flavor appears somewhat similar to a Barleywine style. The mouthfeel is pretty unremarkable, medium body, soft carbonation. Overall the drinkablility suffers from the harsh alcohol.

I was expecting a little more complexity from this beer, but overall this ended up being a little bit bland. It was slippery and smooth on the tongue, and not as thick as I initially suspected. By the end of the drinking session, the 10% ABV started to wear me down a little. A good pick up however for a Saturday night like this, where I can stay in bed late tomorrow.","rajendra82","Feb 03, 2007"

The sweetness might put some off, but I don't think you can make something this complex and large without this level of sweetness. It is a perfect beer to substitute for both a vintage port and a island single malt scotch (esp. Lagavulin 16 year old), if you need a beer to stand in temporarily for a higher ranking (in age and alcohol) dead soldier.","xymyl","Jan 06, 2007"
4.33,6.9,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Richly textured as the sugary malt provides a mild oily texture to the mouth, but then the pepper and carbonation delivers a pang of sharpness and a lift of evaporation that allows for just enough lightness for easy of drinking.

The presence of candi sugar is quite evident as well as some dry figs characteristics. Yeast is totally overshadowed by the malt and the alcohol. Body is just above average but could be fuller and carbonation was appropriate.

Apple, chocolate, and toffee all make contributions as well. The finish has a tootsie roll character and fruit lingers beyond that. No alcohol was apparent.

4,-1.2,4,4,4,4,4,"Poured a deep red-brown with a champagne like head which quickly dissapated. Nose is of dark fruits, sugar, and alcohol. The first taste reminded me of champagne because of the high carbonation and high alcohol. There was an overwhelming blast of the dark fruits at the beginning of the taste quickly passing to a sugary alcohol finish. Mouthfeel is very lively but it was thinner than I thought it would be.

Aroma is slightly spicy, slightly fruity, a bit yeasty, a lot going on, but could be a bit more intense for the style, in my opinion.

The body was a ruddy brown. Aroma was very sweet with various fruits, caramel and sugars. There was a bit of spiciness to it as well and another scent that reminded me of English style barley wines. Sweetness was dominant in the flavor as well with various fruits coming through and a good dose of caramel/toffee. Sugar and spice were prevalent as well. Something in the flavor reminds me of barley wines as well. A bit of lingering spice was on the finish. Fairly thick and slick was the body and it had quite a warming feel to it as well. Pretty good stuff but the sweetness became cloying towards the middle and really made the last glass drag on.

4.47,10.4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"A long-standing bottle delivers a very clear first glass of ruby-mahogany topped by a short head of of ivory foam. (Subsequent glasses naturally pick up a bit of yeast). The head retention is limited by the alcohol, and it slowly drops to an average collar but leaves some nice splashes of lace about the glass. The nose is caramelish, peppered with a light splash of red and dark fruit, some mild candy (sugar, licorice, honey), and yeasty fruitiness. Very nice! It's smooth and slick across the palate with a very, very fine natural carbonation that's surprisingly moderate for the style; and a body that's medium-full. The flavor is more intense than the nose suggests, yet it remains restrained. Dark fruits, baked brown-sugar, yeasty spice, vanilla-suger glazed donuts, slightly burnt bread-crusts, and a masculine push of bitterness round it out. And the alcohol never appears in either the flavor or the aroma; even after more than one serving! It's very nice... not overly rich or syrupy, and exceptionally well-balanced. There are certainly more complex examples of a ""Grand Cru"" (which is not a style, but a designation), but this one delivers an exceptionally rounded and enjoyable, ""drinkable"" beer. It's well recommended, as are almost all of the other Alesmith beers!","NeroFiddled","Sep 21, 2004"

Then she creeps in with a blend of barleywine like caramel rich malt backbone blended with a dubbel raisin and tart fruit notes somewhat of a curveball.

Taste was somewhat sour in that Belgian way, also a little cooked wine and a lot of plum prune and dark sour cherry. Hints of scotch whiskey soaked fruit as the beer warms. Nicely carbonated even almost 4 years later. Drinkability is good as the alcohol is well hidden. Definite an after dinner lounging before the fire type beer. Thanks to Eyechartbrew for the bottle and to BiermanVa for drinking it with me.","TinusTime","Apr 10, 2004"
4.6,13.6,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,"Comments  Ive only had a handful of ales that can measure up to this one. The BigDog (xlperro) sent me this along with a few other beers and some kick ass homebrews. A big BA Thanx for this awesome offering.","RoyalT","Mar 05, 2004"
4.46,10.1,5,4,4.5,5,4.5,"Dark brown color. Mead head. Aroma is malt, brown sugar, hops, clove and banana and I could spend a long time just smell this beer. A full-bodied Belgian Strong Ale. Malts are fruity (bananas, peaches and raisins) bready and sweet. Very well balanced. Extremely smooth, nearly creamy taste. Touches of must and wood, vanilla and caramel. Some sherry and wine like characters are here as well. The 10% alcohol is very well hidden. Flavors of figs and plums come out as it warms, and I swear it get even smoother tasting. Nice beer. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and dry. Aftertaste is slightly sweet.","beerguy101","Mar 05, 2004"
3.5,-13.6,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"The body is a very dark red there's not a lot of head, but there's enough. There are lots of fruity esters and a warmth to the malt. It's a bit alcoholic, but not overpowering, although it does give it a bit of a bourbon undertone. I was a bit underwhelmed by the beer, though.","aracauna","Feb 23, 2004"
4.1,1.2,4,4,4,5,4,"Cloudy deep brown body, small light brown film consisting of ultra-sticky tiny bubbles. Aroma is deep maltiness, fruity (raisin, prunes), chocolate, caramel, earthy, notes of dirt and alcohol. A bit of a let down on that department, not to intense nor complex, this could have been made by any belgian brewery. Taste gets a little more serious, tons of malt in there, smoky honey and maple, chocolate, caramel. A good earthy profile too accompanies the woody sphere. Quite complex with a very mild bitterness and an alcohol bite. Medium body, silky smooth, creamy. As this is my first Alesmith, it's definitely not up to my expectations from this highly acclaimed brewer which seemed (reading other reviews) to brew beers made just for me. It apparently is not the case, but I'll gladly give a try to their other products despite having to lay down 10$ on each of those big ones.","Rastacouere","Feb 16, 2004"
4.47,10.4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Lovely looking bottle for a lovely, lovely beer. Pours dark brown/ruby, with just a thin halo of a head. Aroma of dark fruit, with a bit of toffee-scented malt. The flavor is rich -- dark fruits with just a hint of sour, more roasty toffee and a somewhat spicy finish. Smooth mouthfeel with a bit of alcohol warming at the end. A very nice beer and one that will age magnificently.","mzwolinski","Feb 14, 2004"
4.65,14.8,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,5,"This is a dark murky reddish/brown liquid with a very fluffy white/beige/tan head of foam. This beer also leaves very excellent belgian lace throughout the glass. The aromas are immense and lovely. They consist of chocolate, raisins, dark fruit, spicy alcohol, zesty hops, caramel and patent roasted malts, yeast, and much, much more! The taste is a lovely melange of heavily malty flavors. As Darren has already stated, this stuff is very reminiscent of a nice 12 year old single malt scotch whiskey. The flavors are all over the place, and consist of: chocolate, dark fruits, spizy hops and alcohol, chocolate and caramel malts, scotch whiskey, and more. The mouthfeel is full, rich, and reminscent of cask conditioned real ale. The mouthfeel is great when this beer is cool (cellar temperature) but it is even better when this beer is warmed up to a warm (70*F) room temp. The tiny bubbles really cling to your tongue, and make the drinkability for this beer excellent! A huge thanks has to go out to Boilermaker88 for trading me, what is possibly, one of the last bottles in the world of this finely aged, nearly 4 year old, brew! Cheers!","francisweizen","Dec 18, 2003"
4.7,16,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,"Yep, this one was a good 'un. It was a dark reddish brown color, I dont remember the head to be honest because I was doing some work while it was poured for me and when I got to it there wasnt much head at all. just a thin layer of bubbles. It smelled sweet, carmel-ish kind of. I knew it would be good. It tasted amazing- a nutty flavor with a butter-toffee taste in there as well. Definitely made me smile, and though I couldn't taste the 10%abv, I could definitely feel it going down all warm. Mouthfeel- just right, soft, and so very drinkable. I hope I get an opportunity to try this again sometime!","erica","Dec 01, 2003"
4.1,1.2,4,4,4,4,4.5,"Thanks for this one BigDog! Youll go to Heaven (youll be on yer own when you get there though, Ill be down below drinking this and the Alesmith Horny Devil)","TheLongBeachBum","Nov 13, 2003"
3.54,-12.6,3,4,3.5,3,3.5,"2003 Vintage. Dark and hazy plum colored with no head at all. Aroma is really malty with some fruit like dried cherries and figs. I don't get the vanilla/chocolate aroma, maybe that was a different vintage. Mouth feel is a bit weak with some dryness and lacks the excitement of a Belgian Grand Cru. Flavor is malty sweet with a hint of caramel and cocoa. Alcohol is very present in aroma and flavor. A bit dissapointing.","BierReise","Oct 27, 2003"
4.33,6.9,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"The pour a deep lucent brown with ruby highlights, the head behemothic in size, spumescent in texture and a winsome light tan color, the lace a velum like sheet to conceal the glass. The nose has a deep malt walnut like sweet aroma, rich and full, fresh a treat for the eye, nose and palate. Start is creamy rich and sweet, top is moderate to full in feel and the finish spiny in its acidity, vinous, hop spicy and desert bone dry aftertaste, a real Hoot in my books.","Gusler","Oct 26, 2003"
4.02,-0.7,3.5,4,4,4.5,4,"I've not had a beer that's been around this long but I definitely liked this. I was a bit swizzled by the time I finished the bottle but that wouldn't stop me from going back to that little store and getting what's left.","Boilermaker88","Oct 02, 2003"
4.18,3.2,4,3.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Flavor, It's nice and sweet and rich on the tongue, with a small bite of alcohol on the roof of your mouth. It was so easy to drink the whole friggin' 750. This is a killer brew.","jcalabre","Aug 18, 2003"
3.45,-14.8,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,3,"This brew pours a small head of finely sized mostly diminishing bubbles that leave a fair lacing and it has a transparent dark amber body. It also had a strong alcohol aroma. Initially, the alcohol flavor comes through, but later softens in the finish.","TheDM","Jul 25, 2003"
4.37,7.9,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,"It comes in a 25 oz. champagne style bottle with a cap and a cork.    The color is amber-brown.  The head is slight and fades rather quickly.  The smell is fruity and just a bit musky.  At first it didn't grab me, but it warmed and really started to expand.  Ripe fruit and hints of chocolate are present but it doesn't have any of the expected spiciness.  However, you won't miss it.  This beer has enough going on as it is.  I'm looking at Alesmith and its lowest rated beer as of today is a 4.14.  I don't know how they do it so consistently, but this is another winner.","mickeymac","Oct 19, 2002"
4.28,5.7,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,"Notes: This is a stellar brew with a deceiving alcohol. Complex flavours keep things in balance with a well rounded spiciness and big malt foundation.","Jason","Apr 27, 2002"
