"2013 vintage from Rattle N Hum in Manhattan. Served back to back with Schlafly's 2008 Oak Age Barleywine. Firestone outshines Schlafly here by far. This is a lovely beer."
""
""
""
""
"appears a clear copper in color, no head.  amazing aroma of vanilla, whiskey, and caramel.  same flavors in the taste.  body was thinner than I hoped."
""
""
""
""
"This beer is wonderful, curious how it will age."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a hazy orangey amber with good legs, fair lacing and a thin collar persisting.  Aroma is earthy and some citrus hop, lots of oakiness, caramel maltiness and vanilla.  Taste is very much like the aroma: sweet toasty bread/caramel malt laced with spicy citrus, vanilla, wet earthy/floral hops.  Light body that makes it crisp with the low carbonation."
""
"Lucky to have this one on tap--have an unopened bottle in my cellar.  Really, really surprised by how good this was.  Great caramel nose, booze was well hidden.  This thing is only gonna get better with age.  Really great stuff."
""
""
""
""
""
"Opened the 2012 this weekend, which was outstanding. Sipping on the 2013 on tap at a local watering hole at time of this posting, which is also fantastic. I highly recommend cellaring this for 2-3 years."
""
""
"The is another hit from FW.  Big flavors that blend together and balance each other.  Very smooth and even with the high abv it is very drinkable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Great complexity and variety of amber shades.  Sunset cherry and ruby highlights. Appealing off-white head and everlasting effervescence. Toffee and butterscotch could be interpreted as some vanilla, coconut, oak, orange. Full body flavor, slick, and good amount of carb. Get some buttered corn, some coarse wood grain, vinous and light char. Rich toffee malts and the slightest  of hop twang."
""
""
""
""
""
"o; A top flight barrel aged Imperial bitter with an amazing mouthfeel and flavor to burn.  Could well be the best out there in its style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Very sweet and sticky, but the flavors and aromas are so amazing that it's easy to forgive its lack of balance."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The 2014 vintage."
"Overall: A knockout. Could have been overly sweet but it dries right out in the finish. More fruit than I would have thought which enhances the flavor. Complex and delicious."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Bottle: Poured a clear copper color ale with a large off-white foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of nice caramelized malt with nice toffee notes and light residual sugar notes. Taste is also dominated by caramelized malt with some toffee notes, light biscuit notes and just the right amount of residual sugar. Body is about average with good carbonation and light warming alcohol. This beer is super well-balanced with just the right amount of complexity and great drinkability."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Very boozy and complex."
""
"Had the 2013 release, so roughly 1.5 years of age on it.  It drank exquisitely, with almost the perfect amount of bourbon flavor and smell backed by a solid malt backbone. Highly recommended seeking this beer out."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Twice as good as the DBA."
""
""
""
""
"Overall-  Definitely a world class beer.  The bourbon presence is subtle, but the flavors imparted (vanila, coconut,etc) blend perfectly with the toffee malts and oak.  Perfectly balanced, all the flavors enhance each other, and the finish is smooth and clean.  Its a shame this will no longer be bottled."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"2013, one year old.  Pours a cloudy reddish brown color with a small off white head.  The odor is barrel like, coconut, bourbon, dark fruits, fig, dates, raisin, whiskey, slight citrus lemon.  The taste is coconut, bourbon, dried fruits, fig, plum, raisin, barrel like, apricot, malty, sugar, slightly honey, barely any alcohol taste, a lot of different notes as warms up, not bitter at all."
""
""
""
""
""
"Picked this up in a great trade with Mike.  2012 vintage.  Dark amber-orange pour with a quickly fading two finger beige head with decent lacing.  The nose is bold and complex with tons of buttery toffee and caramel along with hints of oak, vanilla, coconut, and subtle dark fruits.  The taste mirrors the nose with huge caramel and molasses up front along with hints of vanilla, toffee, brown sugar, toasted coconut, booze, tobacco, and oak.  The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a nice creaminess and smooth, but warming finish.  It gets crazy drinkable as it warms.  Overall, this is a bold and flavorful beer that just kept improving as I drank it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I liked it and thought it was fairly impressive, not very familiar with the style but I enjoyed it.  My only wish is for a little more carbonation and aging to get the back end a little smoother."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I love this beer, FW has the best barrel aged program in the country, too bad this is discontinued, not as smooth as Sucaba, but I think this has a rougher profile than Sucaba, really good, worth $16.99 per bottle, where ever I find it, I am buying and saving it, a must try."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Rich smell of plum, apricot, toffee and butterscotch.. Taste is semi sweet cocoa, toffee, plums, fermented fruit, butterscotch, almond/marzapam and getting lots of bourbon on the finish. Heavy mouthfeel with a sweet, smooth texture and plenty body. Laced the glass like rings at every sip..serve with desserts, vanilla ice cream, flambés,  winter dishes, such as roasted kabocha or butternut squash, pumpkin pie; upmost rich-dishes such as anything browned or buttered or candied!!!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This starts with a smooth light sweetness, maple, toffee, caramel and a honey dipped candy flavor. It ends with stronger toffee and caramel sweetness. FW does nothing but impress and this is right along with their best."

"Pours a touch hazy reddish amber color with a decent sized tightly bubbled tan head that shows moderate retention. Aromas of caramel, brown and caramelized sugar with lots of juicy pitted fruit. Vanilla with a hint of woodiness. The flavor is sweet sugary malt with hints of oak and vanilla and a somewhat overly present alcohol heat. Hints of pitted fruits and a light smoked toffee round the flavor out. Thick body light carbonation, sticky syrupy with an alcohol burn. Very flavorful but shows all of the12% abv. could use a bit of time to mellow but I wouldn't hesitate to pick up another given half a chance."

""
""
""
""
"Not as popular as some of the other BA beers from FW but one of my favorites. Love the BA Barleywine."

"O:  Outstanding English style barley wine.  Sad to see this one go, but at least I have a 2014 bottle yet to enjoy!"
""
""
""
"Firestone usually kills it on any of their special releases, no exception here. So smooth, the body's like liquid silk. Caramel and toffee. Just an outstanding barleywine, and not that far behind Sucuba."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Excellent. Very boozy yet balanced. World Class brew."

"Going into this knowing that we don't particularly love bourbon barrel aged beers, I was stunned. This was such a pleasure to drink, as each sip becomes more and more complex with the temperature of our glasses rising. Beautiful color, nose, taste, and mouthfeel. Overall this is one I expected to be indifferent to, but came out absolutely loving. Should've bought more!"

"O- English Barleywines and Old Ales are one of my favorite styles and when the are barrel aged I usually find them to be amazing and that is the case with this one. I really enjoyed how smooth it was and it really had the same huge toasted coconut and marshmallow that I get from two of my favorites Kuhnhenn BB4D and BCBBW. I hope to trade for more of this in the future."
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a delicious beer, well worth cracking for a special occasion or a long, slow evening."
"D:  Double DBA is another great barrel aged offering in the Firestone-Walker lineup.  While the final blend doesn’t scream Bourbon to me I just can’t get enough of that coconut.  I think that balance is the real testament to the brew masters as I appreciate the fact that this doesn’t pummel you over the head with the spirits like a truncheon yielding bobby.  A bit sweeter than others so best to take some time with this one or share with friends.  Shame they are discontinuing bottles."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Fantastic offering by FW. And a new ""nomenclature"" for me: Imperial Special Bitter. Call it what you want, I'll call it malty magnificence."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"It's smooth as good bourbon with a steady carbonation to it.  It comes on creamy and eases dry without losing the smoothness, while just a bit of crispness gently nips.  It never loses smoothness, and the heat just sort of slides in and into the finish."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Great brew and highly recommended. FW is my favorite when it comes to barrel aging and this one is superb. I have another bottle that I'm going to age for at least 6 months to make a comparison. Understand it's going away but hopefully will return someday!"

"Overall it's a decent aged brew but seems to also hint at lighter strong and old ale qualities, which for the heavy hitting oomph dorks out there probably doesn't get to many people excited.  Great beer to try, and decent for what it is."

"Big vanilla nose, slightly sweet vanilla/barrel taste. Not hot at all. Well balanced for a 12%abv beer. Think ~6 months will put this beer in a good spot. Firestone is truly a master of barrel aging."
""
""
""
""
"Poured from a 22 oz. bottle, into a Belgian tulip glass."
""

"O: Fantastic beer. Go get it before it's gone.  RIP, Double DBA."

"Pour is dark copper with a small amount of tan head. Nose is heavy bourbon, light oxidation, brown sugar, faint dried caramel. Full, luscious body, fairly smooth and creamy with just a bit of grittiness. Flavors are sweet with strong bourbon up front, a hint of paper, lots of malt sugar with brown sugar and caramel flavors. Moderately strong carbonation and a dry finish that brings a hint of booziness and a lingering spice to it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: impressive, but I think I had unrealistically high hopes. Probably a palate issue because the single Double Barrel Ale is one of my least favorite Firestone beers and at its core this has the flavoring of DBA. A nice English barley wine though, especially if you like an after dinner, sweet, sipper."

"It's a shame that this will be the last time this is bottled."

"This one packs quite a punch which I normally don't mind in something like a stout but this one tastes more like a liquor than beer. The taste is pretty close to that of a cognac. This is certainly more of a sipping beer than one watching a ballgame. I really wish I had a nice cigar to go along with this one."
"Very tasty. But rating it as a beer I'm a bit torn. It's nice, but is there really much beer character left here?"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall. This is nice stuff. As part of the big, intense blended anniversary ales, it's clearly a integral part. But on it's own, it's a little bit of an oddity."
""

"a wonderful showcase of the bourbon barrel here. different than all the stouts and thick sticky blends they do, this is a lighter (in color and in roastiness) malt bill than a lot of their big barreled beers. i think it lets the wood and the bourbon flavors really present themselves well. english sort of grain profile to this, sweet and sappy, caramel like, and full bodied. the beer looks about right for what it claims to be, toffee colored beer with bronzed amber edges. not much head from the tap, or at least it settles down pretty quickly. tons and tons of sweet vanilla on the nose, this has very obviously spent a great deal of time resting on bourbon. a sturdy char on the barrel too helps to add depth and mellow what i cant believe isnt hot alcohol. its so well hidden here. there is even some hops in the finish of this one, more than just the requisite english bittering hops, i get a dried straw and corn husk character from them, in addition to just enough bitterness to balance some of the left over sugars in the finish of this. complex and woody, this is a great example of firestone walkers ability to barrel age beers. tons of the whiskey character comes through, and i like the coppery sweet caramel malt. a real treat to drink, it warms up well, and i think its different than what we usually expect from barleywine."

"D: I only bought one due to the price tag, but wish I had cleared the shelf of the three of four boxes they had. This beer does not need any more age, which is good, because I am not sure I could resist. I have been trying to convert my port wine drinking dad to beers for years, and this may be just the one to do it."

""
""
""
""

""

"I really enjoyed this beer. It was a reminder of any of the anniversary ales that I have enjoyed. It wasn't as sweet and flavorful as SUCABA, but for a barley wine it would hold its own against any others out there. This beer knows how to treat you right."

"Final Word: Buy it on the spot, no questions asked! Firestone Walker beers are rarely available outside of the West Coast, much less a reserve series like the Double DBA, so you may only ever get one chance to taste it barring a move to California (though it’d probably be worth the move). All of the flavors in this beer work in perfect harmony to create a drink that sips like a liquid dessert, but without being too sweet or overbearing. Drink it when the air outside is chilly, and let the warm, roasted flavors wrap you up like a blanket."

"D- Great barleywine. Excellent sipper that i'm glad I got the chance to try."
"Taste: There is a nuttiness at first that changes into a sweet vanilla taste and ends with something somewhat smokey."
""

"Overall- A nice BBA Barleywine. Too carbonated but overall, nicely balanced."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Mighty fine brew. Haven't had this fresh, but I'm guessing the age did it well in mellowing out the alcohol presence and letting some of the other flavors come to the fore. Not sure where I'd rank this against FW's other widely-available Proprietor's Vintage beers, but not sure I'd care—it's delicious!"

"O: A very well done barleywine. Firestone really knows how to barrel-age beers, and alongside Sucaba and Parabola this holds up very well. Not as deliciously sweet as Sucaba, but this is still an outstanding beer."
""
""
""
""
"O: A great beer that transforms from a barleywine to a bitter in your mouth."
""
"Firestone's Double Double DBA came in 3rd in my recent beer tasting of Firestone Walker's top beers. Out of the seven BA guys we had at the tasting, Double Double DBA got a 5 from one taster for look, smell, taste, mouthfeel and overall. It scored and average of 4.19 from all the judges."
"Overall, if you've had founders backwoods bastard, and sweet repute, this is almost like a hybrid between those two flavors. Insanely good."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"overall: an excellent beer. Worth cellaring."
""
"O-A good beer, nothing special. Age improved it some."
""
"O - This is a bloody treat. With this, Sucaba, and Parabola (and to a lesser extent, Velvet Merkin), I’m coming to the conclusion that FW is incapable of a subpar barrel-aged beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is the last vintage for this one so buy some if you can find it.  I will give updates on this and the 2013 vintage in the coming years."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Truly another world class brew. I will have to try this side by side with Sucaba to determine which is my favorie."

"Barely pours a head at all, even with a heartily aggressive pour. A few bubbles aggregate again the glass walls, no real appreciable lacing either. There’s a strong, bright glow to the orange to light brown hued liquid, needed given the high level of particulate floating about inside (bottle stood up for weeks), plenty of widely dispersed bubbles as well, looks like a lot of activity in the glass. The nose is balanced and does not betray excessive alcohol presence, a good underlying roastiness stiffens its nostril presence so it’s not overly sugary, still no lack of molasses, caramelized brown sugar, butterscotch, at the same time you get green apple, fig, golden raisin, spiced orange peel and a heavy floral musk, you get more lightly metallic earthiness at it warms, easy as she goes. In the mouth it’s medium-bodied and likewise smooth and flows effortlessly, not looking to make a huge display of itself. More leafy herbal qualities here, bready like challah bread or breakfast rolls. Fruitier with apricot, peach, cherry mixed in with the fig, raisin, date base. Chocolate truffle, toffee, butterscotch, cream soda give it the desired appeal, no sugar bomb. The carbonation could be considered mildly on the high side for the style, not obvious but rock steady and adds to its overall freshness. More for those who want a food friendly version of the style than an experience unto itself. (Proprietor's Reserve Series #002, 2013)"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel/Overall: Medium bodied with about the perfect level of carbonation. Does not come close to drinking to the ABV; not much of a hint of alcohol as you drink this. Overall, another superb barrel aged offering from Firestone Walker. In my mind, just about on par if not better than Abacus. Glad I have a 2013 sitting around to drink as well."

"Boxed 22 oz bottle. Poured gently into a snifter. Light headed, dark rich coloration. A bouquet of scents rising from the surface. Toffee, coconut, nuts...almonds and just plain peanuts. The booze circling out of the glass like smoke from a cabin in the woods. The mouth feel, butter pecan ice cream melting slowly in a porcelain bowl. Coconut spreads across the mouth, the booze warms the tongue, imaginary nuts, shelled and crushed , delicately rise to the surface. Orange toffee desert surfaces at the finish of the swallow. You can sure taste the barrel, the aging process, the phenolics, smokey ...the ester fruity...it has it all. So nice to sip close ones eyes and enjoy. Thank you Adam Firestone, Matt Brynildson and David Walker. Cheers!"
""
"Overall, a wonderful beer that is light years better than the base beer from which it is made. While I'm not really a fan of Double Barrel Ale at all, this one is fantastic. I'd like to get my hands on a second bottle and sit on it for awhile to see how it develops with time, but at six months, it's drinking just fantastic. It's Sucaba's less talked-about but nonetheless impressive sibling."

"O-This is a tasty beer and it made for a nice accompaniment to my Boxing Day meal of Christmas leftovers. Compared against the best Barleywines, this brew might be a little simple, but if I come across another bottle I would consider aging for a bit to see if the booze and sweetness mellow and develop more complexity."
""

"Overall a great beer that I wish I hadn't shared. :)"
""
""
"Big thanks to Dave for breaking this one out. Pours a mahogany hue with no head; just a thin band around the shoulders. Nose expresses ethanol, toffee and buttery notes. Taste consistent with nose - buttery and malty. Mouthfeel is medium-light in body with an easy carbonation and a slight oiliness. Overall, I'm very impressed with this brew. I didn't really know what to expect, but I found this quite enjoyable - not something I would recommend for extended cellaring, however."

"An excellent sipper. Smooth, easy drinking. Gets even better as it warms. Although the barrel smells and tastes are fairly forward, they don't overwhelm to make it too boozy. For a 12 percenter, this goes down so smoothly and easy. Tons of complex caramel and sugary tastes. Beautifully crafted. Just a delight to drink. Can't wait to consume my bottle being aged as we speak. Yum."

"PS- I'll be hoarding this guy all next year also!"

"I was super impressed with this Firestone Walker offering. This is what an English Barleywine should taste like - sweet and balanced, without being an alcohol-bomb or cloyingly hopped. Very nice, and probably my new favorite of the style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: a great beer overall. Lots of great bourbon notes."
""

"One tasty, complex, and strong version of the style, among the last that I'd suspect to come out of this brewing region, what with their predilection for West Coast hop-pimpin'. Robust, thick, and rather enjoyable, the big-ass ABV well ingrained and generally obfuscated. A nice warm-up for a night on the local arts and lit scene with international sex pundit Dan Savage, methinks."
""
""
"Overall – A big and sweet brew with a nice warming and smooth feel. A nice slow sipper."
""
""
""
""
""

"This beer really drinks very easily. The alcohol is not there for a 12% beer. It has a lighter sweetness than that dark, rich toffee sweet barleywine. It does a wonderful job for those who find those beers too big and would like to try something that turns things a bit down into more subtle complexity."
"Pours a deep rich amber with a nicely formed one and a half finger off white head atop,great rich clarity and color to this beer.Darf fruit,vanilla,and sweet acohol dominate the nose,some toasted oak is there as well,smells like a booze bomb.Sweetness is the main flavor component of this beer,sweet dark fruit and bourbon notes mixed with more vanilla and jet fuel-like booze.Wow a little to much boozy sweetness for me,I wanna stay awake to see the Tigers beat the ugly beards!"

"TOTAL = 46/50"

"O: A very complex and layered beer. The oak really shines along with the massive amounts of malt. Doesn't really feel like 12% until it hits you over the head. A great BA brew that's worth the $15 price tag"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Double a double can be good or it can be bad. In the case of this brew, it's quite good. Poured a copper color with a small cream head. Light lacing on the glass. The smell is malty, wood and yes sweet. The mouth feel is smooth and sweet, a bit to sweet for me. There is no alcohol after taste. Full of Carmel toffee and oak. This one goes down very easy, and at 12 percent this could be a bad thing! A wonderful after dinner sipping brew. Firestone is getting very good with the oak barrels in there brewing."
""
""
""
"Mid-full on the palate, the beer plays out with little carbonation in order to finish with some semblance of dryness. Its a succulent and savory ale that retains much of its creamy sweetness to extend well into the beer's next sip. Finishing semi-dry, the ale offers a good degree of drinkability but is a tough out for anyone under a party of four."

"Overall: Hides the abv so damn well, this is a real treat. Would drink again, and wouldn't hesitate to pick up this year's vintage to test drive."
""
""
""
"O: Glad I bought a second. Expert use of the barrel and the bourbon flavor really sets the DBA off. An achievement."
"Overall: This was everything that I expected. This was also very well crafted, nicely balanced, and the base beer was just spot on to the style of an English barleywine! This is an exceptional example of its style and if you are a fan of American and English-style barleywines, don’t miss out on this limited release!"

"Overall - My first brew from Firestone Walker and i wasn't disappointed. An excellent barleywine and one of the best American brews i've had... Definitely recommended although at £18 or so a bottle not something a could afford too often !!"
"Overall: This is an excellent beer. Such a complex aroma and taste to this one, it's a shining example of barrel aging quality. This is one to sip, savor and experience. It can run a bit expensive ($14.99 per bomber in this area), but it's definitely worth the price tag. Pick this one up while it's available."

"As someone who's had my fair share of barrel-focused beers, barleywines, and spirits, it's hard not to go nuts over a beer like this. It's superbly made and blended, and you can tell a lot of care was put into the blending and choosing of the barrels, as well as the flavor profile that makes this beer up. This is hard and costly stuff to make - and it's nothing short than impressive that FW has managed to make a beer like this affordable AND accessible to all in their distro. This vintage is drinking great - it's going to be tempting not to open my 2013 bottle!"
"O - 4.75 - I guess I should have expected this to be amazing for a twenty dollar beer, but god damn. It really doesn't taste like anything else I've ever had. I haven't really gotten into aging beers yet but my guess is that aging this one would only make it better. I've always been one to avoid spending over 6-10 dollars on a bomber or six pack but this completely changed my attitude. Absolutely amazing. The only thing I could ask is a little bit more head, but hey, at 12% what are they supposed to do?"
""
"Overall (4.5/5): Double DBA is an excellent example of why Firestone Walker is one of the best breweries in the country. I'm blown away by the barrel character on this beer. Here is a rich beer worthy of the most special occasion. Excellent stuff that really is worth the $18.99 price tag."

"Overall a great beer. Balanced very well and no one flavor is dominant. The flavors also change nicely throughout."

""

"Overall, I can definitely see why this is classified on here as a barleywine (which is apparently what ESBs turn into when they evolve). The barrel aging has sapped any bitterness this beer once had, turning into a dark, sweet, sipping pleasure."
""
""
"As usual, Firestone knocks it out of the park with this beer. They took their flagship beer, DBA(Double Barrel Ale), doubled the recipe and aged in a mix of neutral oak and mixed spirit barrels. What comes out of these barrels, is a bit of an anomaly; Im not sure how Firestone managed to take a 12.5% 'Imperial Special Bitter' and still have it drink like a heavy ESB, with out it even verging into English Barleywine territory. This beer isn't their most complex Barrel Aged beer, but it certainly drinks the easiest. The low profile malts really allow the barrels to shine. I can't say I've had something quite like this. Bravo, Firestone."

"It has been some time since I have written a full review. The beer I am drinking now has inspired me to return to the art of the beer review. I had a bottle of this when it was released...eh? Few times has aging a beer resulted in such beneficial returns. The appearance is a lovely garnet color, and rather clear. Some lacing is left by the rather light tan head. Aroma is interesting, the barrel has faded almost completely and what is left is a port like quality. Kind of fig like dried fruit thing. The flavor pops. Smooth. There is still barrel in the flavor. Fruity, caramel, toffee, all of the great flavors you would expect from an English strong ale. Oh wait this is an American strong ale? Who listed it as such? The surprise of this beer is that it is soft, balanced, and meshes with itself. Not cloying, not sweet, really great. This beer is full on the palate, it does not burn, it is not cloying. Remember this ale is around a year old now."
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a very good beer; I can see why Firestone uses it for their anniversary beers. The alcohol flavor would fade with proper aging, and there is a good amount of flavor, smoothness, and depth of character to the beer itself."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a fantastic brew. Amazing drinkability. Not too heavy or overpowering that you'd get burnt out on it. I love it:)"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Yum yum all the way around!"
"Probably the least of the Proprietor's Reserve series I've tried by FW, and this is evinced by the fact it sits on the shelves much longer than Parabola, Sucaba, the anniversary ales, and Velvet Merkin. That being said, it's still a worthy candidate for a nice warming, winter drink with friends. Be careful, it'll sneak up on you quick."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - A complex, highly drinkable barleywine/strong ale. This was bottled 365 days ago, so I imagine some heat has come off this guy now. Very tasty and worth a try for you barrel-aged fiends. Go grab one if you can. Cheers!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - I did not expect the beer to feel this massive. The booze is incredibly noticeable. Like a barrel aged old ale with a huge fruit presence but not as heavy. I wasn't totally sold initially but I really warmed up to it. Its very unique against the masses of BA barley wines out on the market. BA Imperial Bitter...go figure!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This will not be a full depth review. Smells thick,slightly sweet,boozy warm. taste is delicious bourbon and caramel, something like a barrel aged ipa. Sticky, super boozy, but in an appetizing way. Finishing a little hot for my taste, but it's working. Kind of struggling to hide the alcohol, reminds me of Old Stock in that way. This is much better. I'd say the strong notes are more refined than that."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Call it what you will, but there are barrel-aged brews out there that don't really do it for me. Often I find too much booziness will get in the way of more subtle, enjoyable qualities of a beer. This one is no exception. It's good, but this just isn't my cup of tea. Take away the bourbon flavors, and this beer barely has a leg to stand on it's own."
""
""
""
"O-This does the trick. Big beer with complex flavors that holds the drinkers attention while sipping on a cold day. Drinks more like a spirit than beer. Continues to improve as it warms. Well done."
""
"Overall, another very good beer from firestone walker. Without much style-wise to compare It to, it's hard to say how truly good this is."
""
"o- This is a great beer. It'll probably put me to sleep, but that's ok!"
""
"Addendum: Opened a bottle that had been aged 1 year. Bourbon flavor is much more evident but all remnants of alcohol warmth and boozeyness are gone. All carbonation gone, becomes a little thin. Not my favorite beer that I've aged, lost a little too much ""character""."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"[O] Fantastic. As far as FW offerings go, and in my opinion of course, Double DBA is a more complete beer than say 14, 15 or Abacus - and every bit as good as Parabola."
""
"Overall: More evidence that Firestone Walker has one of, if not the best barrel program in the world. Incredibly complex and flavorful, while at the same time maintaining a surprising level of drinkability. This one's definitely a winner."
""
""
""
"Classic FSW barrel program. Big malt sweetness, vanilla, toffee and dark fruit. This is a bourbon neat. If you love bourbon and GI BCS, this is a must, esp. the price. $13 is a steal. I'm stunned! Drink now or cellar. Just simply Awesome!!!"

"O: another great example of why fw is the best at barrel aging"

"Overall: An interesting beer, with a lot of complexity; really rather sweet, however, and more suitable for an after-dinner nip, as a result"
"O - A very tasty and complex strong ale. Sweet up front but balanced nicely by earthy hops and a spicy alcohol bite. A true delight."
""
""
""
"A unique barrel aged offering. I wasn't sure what to expect but Firestone Walker has another winner here. Lots of sweet malty goodness in this nice slow sipper that. Full of depth and character."
""
""
""
""
"O: Pretty good, but it would probably benefit from some more aging. Personally, I prefer my Lukcy Basartd and Double Bastards over this one."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"On tap. Pours a copper brown with a small tan head settles to a ring and leaves some light lacing on the glass. The aroma is lots of caramel, bourbon, vanilla, and toffee as well as some light oak, a bit of nuttiness, and some sweetness. The taste is sweet with lots of caramel, some oak, some light bourbon, toffee, and a light nuttiness. The finish is toffee and some lingering barrel notes. Medium body. Low carbonation."
""
""
"Overall this was another great beer from Firestone Walker, but a bit too brash after only six months in the bottle. I feel some more age would be beneficial for the flavors to mellow and mesh and I will be revisiting my other bottles down the line to see how this develops."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

""

"This is sexy boozy. The barrel is brings some heat & the base beer slinks up against it like it's a cold night. And it is. Excellent beer that's warming my toes. Kickin' off my slippers. Ahhh."
"Glad to have copped this for cheap, it's not quite on the level as Sucaba and most places charge upwards of $20 for it."
"Again, this smells great. Fruity and nutty, not so smokey. Very tasty. I might give it higher marks this year."
""
""
"Pours a deep, warm shade of amber. Small, light beige head, which dissipates to nothing. Filtered. The aroma is dominated by rich caramel and toffee malt flavors. There's some apricot, coconut, sugar cane, almonds and cotton candy. The taste is sweet and luxurious. It's pretty much a delicious barleywine with light barrel notes. I'm mostly getting vanilla and a light woodiness from the barrel-aging. There's some fairly subtle bourbon in the background, but it meshes into the other notes quite nicely. Some booze in the aroma, but it mostly just warms up the palate once you take a sip. The mouthfeel is smooth and thick, but it never got cloying for me. This is one of the best barrel-aged beers that I've had from FW, probably my second favorite after Sticky Monkey (? - one of the barleywines that was used in a recent FW anniversary beer). It does a particularly good job of showing FW's light touch with barrel-aging. Great stuff."
""
"O: I was way more impressed by this one than I thought I was gonna be. The aromas and flavors are really great. It's pretty sweet but it's nowhere near cloying."
""
""
"Pours dark orange with a frothy off white head that quickly dissipates to a thin ring. Aroma is typical of FW barrels: rich toasted oak, sweet caramel malts, faint dark fruits, toasted coconut. Taste is huge notes of toasted coconut, American oak, and sweet caramel upfront. Middle of the mouth brings some notes of rum soaked dark fruits and slight bitterness to cut the sweet malts. Finish is long lasting and mouth coating. No alcohol is perceptible. Mouthfeel is exceptionally smooth and creamy. Another great FW barrel aged beer. The barrel characteristics are remarkably similar among these beers. Aroma and taste were very similar to Parabola in the barrel notes, until the crafting of the beer takes you in a different direction."
""
"Poured from bomber into tulip glass. Pours a solid mahogany and amber color with a thin crown of beige foam. The nose is dominated by vanilla, caramel, coconut and toasted oak characteristics. The taste starts out with lots of toffee, brown sugar, candied date and caramel malt flavors. From the oak, there’s notes of vanilla, bourbon and caramelized sugars. The body is slightly syrupy with soft carbonation and a dry, oaky booze burn finish. Overall, a very nice double strength ale!"
"Overall: I was more impressed with this than I was expecting. Quite good. I probably wouldn't get it over Sucaba or definitely Parabola, but I would have this again."
""
"Bottle poured into Duvel glass. Appearance is toffee colored gold with heavy visual weight and minimal head retention. Nose has intense rush of bourbon up front with heavy carmel malt character to follow. Notes of honey and pine come through at the end. Taste starts with rich molasses and plenty of malty sweetness. Vanilla and oak come next with a sharp boozy punch at the end. Mouthfeel is heavy with moderate carbonation. Overall, this is quite the bourbon bomb, the base beer doesn't seems to hold up the flavors as well as a stout or barleywine. Also a bit hot."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Well I must say I was a little underwhelmed, I had higher hopes for this brew. I forgot to mention i was drinking this alongside of a Boltcutter and a 2010 Bourbon County Vanilla Stout, both very different beers, but just as big. It is certainly not a bad beer but I think the taste and mouthfeel could be better. And I'm sure it will be from the bottle conditioning and some age which will help blend the flavors and mellow the alcohol. I'd like to try the base beer too. I'll update my review when I revisit. Another interesting barrel aged concoction from FW and I'm not surprised. Copp a bottle and age awhile."

"2012 vintage. Pours a murky dark brown color with almost no head. Good amount of lacing. Aroma is boozey with some dark fruits, brown sugar, some spices and caramel. Earthy with some nice notes from the barrel. The tastes is earthy booze upfront with some sweet caramel. Vanilla and booze at the finish. Reminds me a bit of a Scotch Ale. Heavy mouthfeel. Pretty tasty slow sipper with a nice boozey, barrel aged flavor. Overall, another hit by Firestone Walker."

"Pours amber with very little head. Aromas of bread, heavy sugar and hard candy. Vanilla toffee maybe with some oaky scotch. Slight hops in the smell. I can tell this will be intense. Flavor is very sweet to start, but seems to mellow out to keep it from being too, too cloying. Still a bit overly sweet for my liking. Flavor of brown sugar candy, toffee and vanilla. Ever so slight bitter on the finish, with strong booze lingering a bit. Very much highlights the english malt here. The barrel aging definitely comes out in this one. Heavy slick mouthfeel. Very interesting. Glad I tried it but won’t likely seek it out again. That’s not to say I wouldn’t have it again if offered."
"O - Man is this tasty, one of the best tasting strong ales I have had. Why, oh why didnt I age this longer? (Answer: it was Thanksgiving and I my resolve crumbled) Besides the flaw of being a little too boozy, I found it could use a little more body as well. But don't let that talk you out of trying it, this is still an exceptional and rare treat. Nice job, FW."
""
"Overall another very good barrel aged beer from Firestone Walker."

"A delight."
""
""
"O: As the side of the box says, this beer was brewed to be a blending beer, which is exactly what it is. While it certainly showcases the barrel in a way no other beer does, it just seems incapable of existing on it's own, bringing little to the party other than barrel flavor. I have a hard time faulting this beer for being something it was not intended to be. It's like faulting Cook County Stout for not being BCBS. However, the difference is that GI has never bottled and released Cook County Stout as a stand-alone beer."
""
""
""
""
"Like I said, the beer is just more of an engine to carry the barrel flavors. Which is fine; Firestone does barrels better than almost anyone. Like a mild barrel-aged barley wine."

"O: Man, what a great beer. Not sure the style, but still great nevertheless!"
""
""

"SRM: 27 (Dark Ruby)"

"Overall this is a pretty well crafted beer by FW, seems like it could use some more hopping to balance the sweetness. This is a pretty fun beer to try if you want to swing the price tag."

""
""
""
""
"Having had Abacus/Sucaba, I don't feel that Double DBA reaches that level of magnificence, but it's still an exceedingly strong example of a big, barrel-aged ale."
""
"22oz bottle shared with a friend. Pours brownish-red topped with a thin, beige head. Aromas are huge with bourbon, more bourbon, brown sugar, oak, booze, caramel, toffee, and vanilla. Tastes are just as full - vanilla, oak, bourbon, toffee, buttery, brown sugar, caramel, cotton candy, sweeeet but not cloyingly. Mouth-feel is creamy, smooth, and medium-to-full bodied. Overall, very nice treat, but for the price I'd probably never get it again."
"Trust me, this BEER is worth the price you’ll pay for it. Heck, get two and save one for when the world comes to a end and enjoy……"
""
"Medium body, medium carbonation, just a touch of stickiness. Really enjoyable even if it falls a hair shy of profundity. Get ready for a sugary whiskey treat."
""
"As a whole, this is excellent beer. The barrel aging brings a fantastic oak and vanilla tone to what was obviously already a well-crafted brew, and the flavors mingle together deliciously. The whiskey flavors do tend to overpower the latter half of the mouthful, and the aftertaste is almost completely dominated by bourbon, making the high 12% ABV leave one’s breath feeling as if it could tarnish silver. But even here, this works well with the beer, and the next sip brings fresh berry and sugar notes to blend marvelously with the whiskey vapors. Recommended."
""
"O - very interesting beer. The sweetness was surprising, but a real treat. I don't know how many more chances I'll get to try this, but I'll certainly get it again."
"I poured from a bomber into a SA perfect pint glass. The pour is a deep amber, moderate head, decent lacing. It has a strong bourbon smell, lots of vanilla and oak. The beer has a great bourbon taste, ton of vanilaThe beer is a bit boozey. It has good carbonation, suprisingly smooth for such a big beer. Really enjoyable, exceeded expectations."
""
""
"My vote would be to call this a ""Quadruple Barrel Ale", as ""Double Double"" sounds either redundant or too close to a Jeopardy! bonus. This stuff pours a clear sunrise garnet topped by a finger of light khaki foam. The nose comprises vanilla, light oak, light molasses, fig, brown sugar, a touch of wheated bourbon, maple syrup, and sweet toffee. Yup, malts are the name of the game here, and they're out in full regalia. The taste follows very closely in lock-step, but the fig seems to have dropped out a bit, and the oak has gotten bulkier. Still, an awesome complexity reigns. The body is a stolid medium, with a very light moderate carbonation and a smooth feel. Overall, a damn fine brew, one that comes across similarly t a mild oloroso or muscatel sherry. Gotta say, I was more than pleasantly surprised with how well this sat with me..."
"O: This is a good beer, but it's a vanilla bomb. I opened this bottle to drink in a single sitting, but I really wish I had decided to share it with some. It's a lot to handle solo."
""
"Geez, don't know what happened with this bottle compared to what others seem to have tried. Poured at a cool temperature with a smallish, fizzy, tan head that quicly settled to a couple of dinky islands and no lace. Color is a clear amber orange cherry. Aroma is malt, caramel, hop, solvents, dark ripe fruit. Flavor's similar to nose, sweet and carbonic tang in front, followed by a little bitter and the solvent. Body and carbonation are good. Finish is like flavor, slow taper to a lingering cheap brandy aftertaste accented by the alcohol."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is the first barrel aged beer that I've had in which the barrel flavor hasn't overpowered the base beer, except for KBS. Superb mix of flavors from the beer and the barrels. Wish I had bought another bottle or two."
""
"Medium body with a touch of carbonation. Very warming beer due to the high abv, though not too pronounced in the taste."
"The flavor has a similar complexity, sweet with a nice bitterness giving it definition and contrast. I get more caramel, a roasted coconut, some cinnamon and dark chocolate. It’s smooth, malty and warmed well. The alcohol is present at 12% but it doesn’t show it. This is one of those brews that had me reminiscing about it days—nay, weeks—later."
""
""
"Pours a hazy copper color with highlights of orange, good cap of dense, khaki colored foam, good lacing. Scent is filled with notes of toffee and caramel along with classic barrel notes of oak, vanilla, light bozzyness. Taste a little more deep and complex then scent dictated, still same qualities but with a little added earthiness to it. Not overly sweet by any means, but toffee and caramel are still the star, along with the aging barrel. Fuller side of medium bodied, slightly smooth. Good solid beer, they got the barrel thing down pat, but this may be one of the weaker base beers to do this with. Would take Anniversary, Parabola or Sucaba any day over this."

"A fantastic strong ale with pronounced flavor."

"3.5/4/4.5/4/4"

"pours a dark copper with a sheet of light caramel foam. Smells like I'd expect - vanilla, bourbon, cherry, oak, sweet caramel, nougat and some bits of tawny porto. Flavor is sweet and nougaty with some vanilla, oak, alcohol, a little bit of bitterness and toffee. Full bodied with light, fleeting carb. A nice beer, something on the caliber of FW, but not something I'm nuts about buying a load of."
""
"Enjoyed this beer (as I have enjoyed pretty much all of their barrel aged offerings), but nothing too memorable or outstanding."

"D - This beer could get me hurt."
""
""
"O: not bad, but not a go to like the other barrel aged beers from FW. $16 for a bomber at Rogers Park Fine Wine and Spirits. Very sweet, but has great flavors. This makes it delicious but has poor drinkability."
"O: The barrel aging likely made improvements to an already good beer - I enjoyed the strong bourbon presence. I had really high expectations for this beer and it feel just a hint shy of them but that is mostly because everything else from the brewery has been really great."
""
"O: The complex flavors of this beer make it a nice one to drink but it's not that difficult to consume because the alcohol is relatively well hidden from the taste."
""
""
"o: Seems to be some similarity with Sucaba. Booze is not hidden at all. A good beer for sipping on a cold night."
""
""
""
""
"O: really well balanced given the ABV, great bourbon notes, really complex and delicious, wish i had a couple more bottles of this to put away for a while"
"O: This is a big beer with a lot of balance given the strength and complexity of all the flavors and aromas going on here. This beer will definitely take the sting off a cold winter night and is an excellent substitute for an after dinner glass of scotch bring many similar flavors."
"O: Even though it is an imperial bitter, it comes off like a poor man's Abacus, pretty good, but I would rather drink the barleywine."
"Very enjoyable and drinkable"
"Beer is big, heavy, sweet, malty, very strong, mild booze, mild ethanol, nice beer, really grows on me, the warmer it gets the better it gets, seriously. I'd have it again."
""
"Pours a hazy orange, no head. Smell is apple cider and banana bread. Not hiding the alcohol at all. Not my cup of tea 2oz bomber pours clear deep ruby red with tan head of foam. The aroma offends with robust levels of booze, sweet whiskey, coconut and candy like sweetness. I can’t say that the taste is any different. It is just full up booze and whiskey that gets hot and boozy from time to time. It also has lesser notes of sort of a coconut to candy like sugary sweetness."
"Poured into a Black Raven pint glass. Pours a medium red-orange amber. Half finger fine light tan head with good retention and lacing. Great bourbon, caramel malt and dark fruit aroma with a note of oak. Flavor is strong vanilla, bourbon, caramel malt, nuts, great bourbon and oak finish. This is delicious. Medium bodied with a silky, creamy mouth feel. This is an interesting take on a strong ale, with the malt body noticeable lighter than a barrel aged barleywine or stout, but the malt sits in the background just enough to showcase the other great flavors. Another ale that needs caution because it so pleasant to sip, but packs a punch. Another Firestone Walker gem. I was torn by wanting to give this a 5 for taste, I liked it that much, but there is a slight bump of alcohol in the finish. I really liked this and hope to see it again."
""
"This kind of reminded me of a not-as-good bb4d. I'd definitely drink it again if someone offered it to me, but it needs to be a bit bigger and more complex to really shine."
""
"Definitely a sipper but good, nice to see a unique barrel-aging experiment."
""
"O/D-Closely resembles their last Anniversary beer and also a bit like Sucaba. I enjoyed both of those beers more. Double DBA is huge and tasty to boot, but it lacks the complexity and drinkability of some of the other barrel aged FW brews. Nevertheless, all of FW's barrel aged collection brews are gems. This one just isn't in the same tier as a few of the others I have tried."
"Overall a fantastic beer that I enjoyed thoroughly. The smoothness is unbelievable. I like ba beers a lot so this hits the spot in a great way. I would have given the overall a 4.25 if it were available."
""
"overall: nice stuff"
"Barleywine like but not quite as rich as that style. Definitely unique and nice use of barrels."
"The first whiff made me think of some of the strong dark Nordic brews I favor. Perhaps some sherry and port in the mix too (as far as smell goes). Anyway, a big, flavorful beer -- heavy on the malt characteristics overall; nicely balanced with an appealing alcohol warmth (considering its high ABV). Gonna get me another bottle or two while I can..."
""
"O - This is a really delicious, big beer. It wasn't too hard to drink despite its potent ABV. Sipped it slowly over a long sunday afternoon of football."
""
"Medium bodied with a sweet, spicy bourbon barrel presence that's nicely integrated into the flavors of the base beer. The barrel is really stong up front dominating the flavor but the virgin oak counters the bourbon character really well. Dry toasted oak/earthy wood along with silky vanilla and toasted coconut flavors tone down the spicy bourbon heat but there's still plenty of sweet spirit flavor. Again, I'm not picking up much hop bitterness but there's a substantial malt backbone underneath the strong barrel flavors. Sweet caramel malt along with toffee, nut, bread, biscuit and subtle light fruit notes. At first there's some strong warmth/alcohol heat in the finish but once the palate adjust, the high ABV is decently masked, making this complex sipper easier to drink than expected."
""
"This one sure was fun. Probably best shared because the bourbon flavor becomes a bit much after too long. Took me awhile to finish it. But I did enjoy it. Not my favorite Firestone, would like to give this another shot sometime."
""
""
"Overall: The best beer I have tasted that has been imported to Massachusetts in a long time. The smell is amazing with the pineapple being so fresh. The oak and the whiskey tastes are present but never overbearing. I will certainly pick this up again as a treat for special occasions."
""
""
""
"O - Overall a quite bourbony beer. Definitely boozy...and definitely a slow sipper. Wish I had waited to open this bottle when it could be shared. Gonna be a bit tough to get thru the whole bottle on my own. Not much of the base beer comes thru over the bourbon and leaves little additional character...basically a conduit for bourbon at a reduced alcohol level."
"Overall: Tasty beer. Sort of Abacus/Sucaba-light (this description originally brought to you by BA morningthief). I would buy it again, but I'm also a sucker for strong American oak flavors."
""
""
""
"Fuller body, milder carbonation, sticky and chewy on the tongue. Another well constructed beer that benefits from a tasty barrel treatment by Firestone Walker - I wasn't sure if I'd be into this one but this was really delicious."
""
"o - Overall I thought this was a very good beer, but a tiny bit hot. Definitely let it warm up a bit as it gets a lot better, though the bourbon is still a bit strong. Worth checking out and would like to get a second bottle of this to hold onto for a little bit."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a really nice barleywine with tons of flavor. Full, rich, and complex. A definite sipper that gets better as it reaches room temp. The fruit flavors that pop at room temp make this beer."
""
""
""
"O: Extremely drinkable and tasty considering the 12% ABV. As a fan of oak and caramel, I definitely will be picking up this one next year."
""
""
""
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied with carbonation being moderate. Pretty nice beer overall. I thought the toasted, caramel malts were really showcased nicely in it. The barrel flavors could have stood out a little more, but I liked what was there. It came together well and was pretty enjoyable overall."
""
""
""
"A really solid beer, my only quelm being that it is really sweet. If not for the barrel treatment, this beer would be cloying. Delicious for a dessert beer though and i loved the unique papaya notes."
"overall, this is quite an amazing beer..if you can even call it a beer at this point. Of course, id recoomend it. In fact, id love to find out how this would age. Id imagine this to be amazing in 3-5 years..."
""
""
"O- Yet another tasty brew from FW. Not on the level of Abacus or Parabola for me, but it’s definitely different and it definitely works. 4."
""
""
""
"From a tiny Firestone snifter, it smelled a bit like hot, gooey banana bread. Lot's of buttery brown sugar and spicy goodness plus bourbon and vanilla. Tiny bubbles slowly rise through the clear, somewhat thick, mahogany-colored beer. It melts over the palate like a soft liqueur. It's delicate, but anything but subtle. The tinier the sip, the better."
"Overall: I picked up a few bottles at $7 a bottle and feel like its a steal, very worth every cent. I like this offering from Firestone walker and look forward to seeing how they lay down for so time."
""
""
""
""
"O- This is fantastic! It really comes alive and shows it's worth as it warms. I'll just call this an English Barleywine and leave it at that! Tons of vanilla/toffee/caramel/candy corn!!! I keep trying to think how this Strong Ale could be better... but I can't! Really glad I have more of this to age and let develop and come into it's own!"
""
"Double Double Barrel Ale pours a murky mahogany, with some bright red highlights. Two fingers or so of bone colored foam crown the beer, and both head retention and lacing are just average. The nose is beyond spectacular. Aromas of butterscotch, burnt sugar, vanilla, oak, and coconut are bolstered by just a hint of bourbon. That boozy bourbon is a little more front and center for the favor profile. There's still a strong foundation of caramel, vanilla, and burnt sugar in the opening of each sip, but some of the nice secondary notes from the nose are drowned out, at least partially, by the lightly alcoholic bourbon finish. The finish is full and a little rich, but without crossing the line and becoming syrupy. I've come to expect excellence from Firestone Walker, especially in their lineup of bottle releases. Double Double Barrel Ale, while drinking just a little hot right now is a worthy addition to the set. I'll be laying a few down to age for sure."
""
""
"Drink- I really love what FW has done with barrels. They went strong ales and stout vs the bruery and sours. This particuar treatment isnt like Parabola and Abacus or Sucaba and that it needs more time become special vs. a grand slam vs a hr right out the gate."
"I'm so happy to see yet another ""component"" beer from Firestone show up in bottles and be allowed to shine on it's own. Great stuff."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a nice take on a hybrid barleywine/barrel aged strong ale. Really interesting flavors, but they still feel like they need time to come together completely. A bit lacking in body and fullness of flavor, but very drinkable for the ABV."
"O- Good barrel aging and a good beer. At first it seemed hot (not too hot for 12%), but the more I drink this the less hot it seems. I am very happy that I was able to get a bottle, just wish I had a bottle to age!"
""
"I like this beer."
""
""
"Another solid barrel beer from FW, although I'm not sure the base beer is perfectly suited to hold up to bourbon treatment. Still the solidly balanced mixture between bitter, sweet and boozy was done very well and I enjoyed it. While no one element stands out as being great, the sum of them all is a treat."
""
""
"Cheers..."
""
""
""
"O: This was a like a sugary, barleywine-light. I can drink this in small doses and my 8 oz. pour was more than enough. That being said I really do like sweet beers and this one was right at the border."
""
""
"O: Firestone Walker defines the category of barrel-aging. They do it so well. All of their big beers are exceptional. Every beer aficionado/connoisseur should have the opportunity to try this. Outstanding!"
"O - Another solid score but I'm not jumping out of my shoes, but really...I don't have any other Barrel Aged Ales to compare it to. It's delicious! I'd be very curious as to what age will do to this beer. Hopefully bring out more of the base beer BUT, the big barrel flavor dominating right now is quite sublime while still being a ""one trick pony."" I wish this year's Parabola had more of this much Barrel influence BTW."
"o - overall, not sure what an imperial special bitter should taste like, but i can tell you that this is pretty tasty. not the best FW barrel aged brew, but certainly feels like a component of the anniversary beers. more of a barleywine to me than anything else, but the extreme heat on this beer dominates. could probably use some time to mellow out a bit."
"I like this one, it hits hard so be forewarned. Another fine special release from FW."
""
""
"Note: A second tasting of this on tap the next day was shorter in flavor and complexity and bigger in booze and barrel. More one-dimensional but still damn delicious."
""
""
"O: probably a great cigar beer, has a nice smokiness and strong character; again, I'd have pegged it for an old ale or scotch ale - warms well, finishes great, wonderful aftertaste - glad I got my hands on one"
""
""
"Oh my! This beer is phenominal. Dobule Barrel Ale is good for its style, but when I heard about this one, I just knew it would blow my expectations out of the water. This one is actually pretty close to an old ale. Strong notes of toffee and caramel, a touch of vanilla. Very nice. I wish the nose were a little stronger, though. That's really my only complaint. This beer was expensive, but worth it! Another excellent brew from Firestone Walker."
""
""
""
"M: Medium to full."
""
""
""
"Pretty good brew. I've always been impressed with the FW reserve series and this one does a good job as well. The flavors are all very well developed on their own and don't get all in each others business."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - The box says Imperial Special Bitter, but it's listed as an American Strong Ale. What ever it is, it's damn good. Another great reserve brew from Firestone. If I can buy another one, I will definatly age it so hopefully it cools off a little bit. That's my only complaint."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"For me, this was awesome. Toffee, vanilla, oak and bourbon are some of my favorite things to find in big, rich beers and this has all of those. Another testament to the wonderful brewers and blenders at FW."
"This was some wonderful beer. While it's a big beer, it holds it well together and it doesn't feel like it's overpowering."
"O - This is a good beer, very drinkale and delicious. I think they nailed what they were going for, as it tastes exactly like a huge, barrel-aged version of an English session ale. However, the relatively mild flavor profile makes it a bit one-dimensional - it doesn't quite have the complex flavor profile of it's Proprieter's Reserve brethren, but I think it will be worth throwing a few of these in the cellar to see how they look a couple of years from now."
""
""
"Lighter body, soft carbonation. The barrel aging seems to really dominate this style. Not a bad thing, but not as good as some of their other offerings. Still, Firestone seems to be very strong in the barrel aging stuff."
"Overall this beer is really good. I'd pair it with some steak though, or barbecue."
"Double Double Barrel Ale looks pretty dead from the tap, it came to me with no bubbles whatsoever. I thought there would be something. The color is a dark shoe polish brown with dark bronze within. Smell is very layered, hits of toasted malt, caramel, English yeast, baker's chocolate and coconut. A nice scent of oak/whiskey with warming. A beautiful nose. Taste wise, this delivers, in small sips, it's a huge beer. Pretty simple cold, with deep caramel, toffee, toasted malt, warming brings out the whiskey/oak and coconut. The English appeal is large and in charge. Feel is smooth and just a bit of booze shows towards the end. Carbonation is barely there, if at all. I am glad I ordered this, I like it better than Sucaba, and it's more drinkable as well."
""
""
"O - My favorite out of the barrel aged series from FW. If this beer was available in unlimited quantities it would be a daily brew for me."
"Depends on the mood you're in - barley wine but the whiskey ends up being the hero on the nose and tongue. Looks a bit flat in the glass with little carbonation action but upon taste it is more present than expected - even better than the norm for this style. Nose has whiskey, honey and maybe some syrup. Flavor is strong with the same and as expected brings some heat on the back side."

"An impressive beer, even it it wasn't what I expected."
"Served in a Stone RIS Snifter"
"A beer that just got better as it went down. So damn smooth. Really liked it."
"Mouthfeel is medium-heavy but not as vicious as most 12% barrel aged brews. Smooth and slightly syrupy texture that makes it plenty drinkable. Overall, a really enjoyable dessert beer. Sweet and slightly boozy but incredibly tasty. A little age would hopefully help the more subtle flavors come out."
""

"AHHH! computers! After writing this a 3rd time I hope got my point across."
"Overall this is a pretty good beer but definitely not in the same class as Parabola or Sucaba. Worth trying but I'm not sure I would buy it again."
"Overall a good slow sipper of a beer, maybe not quite as complex as I'd hoped for but a well-balanced and tasty beer."
""
""
"O. A good beer, though not nearly as impressive as its brethren, Parabola and Sucaba. The problem is that the base beer just doesnt bring much to the table. This drinks like a barrel aged mild. That said, the barrel aging is top quality and this drinks very smooth, if one-note. Glad to have tried it, won't need to try it again. Would be surprised if Firestone bottles this again next year. Good but instantly forgettable."
"D - Very drinkable. Very nicely balanced. The sweet malty profile is nicely balanced by the Bourbon barrel character."
""
"M:"
""
"Pours a maple syrup-colored amber with a light beige one and a half finger head. Oak and bourbon and perhaps a hint of toffee on the nose. Smooth oaky bourbon, semi-sweet caramel and vanilla, joined by a touch of fig and dates, and some biscuit notes. Finishes smooth with some alcohol warmth. Full bodied, lower carbonation, with light syrupy accents. A perfect beer to sip and savor. Resembles a barrel-aged English barleywine in certain aspects, however doesn't have the same level of sweetness. A perfect Double version of DBA which displays many of the same characteristic with some added complexity."
"O: I like the description. ""Barrel-Aged Imperial Special Bitter"". It is absolutely correct. Tastes like a super huge english bitter with a bunch of bourbon characteristics thrown in. Basically pure maltiness and bourbon. I bought an extra bottle to put in the cellar, curious to see how this is with a little milder bourbon. Just a bit too hot and heavy on the bourbon, especially in the aftertaste."
"O: another fantastic offering from Firestone Walker, their barrel aging process is truly phenomenal. I thoroughly enjoyed splitting this with 2 others, and I must say that 1 glass was sufficient. Personally, I think this one might be a bit too hit, and will definitely be interested in letting one age for a year or two to see how this one turns out. Other than that, a absolutely terrific beer"
"Overall: This is one hell of a beer but one that I believe should be shared. I really enjoyed this beer and it surprised me at how good it is."
"O - Sweet and lots of barrel characteristics. Subtle bitter finish. A true winner."
""
""
"O: FW kills every BA beer they do. This thing is pretty awesome if you like the BA stuff. The alcohol is manageable right now, and in a few months this thing should drink amazing."
""
""
"Pours an almost-clear, ruby-amber color with a small off-white head that disappears quickly. Scent is definitely full of toffee and vanilla. I pick up the almonds that the box talks about, but very faint. A ton of vanilla with some lovely dark fruit aromas. Rich plums and fresh dates. Nice oak with sweet bourbon aromas. Very inviting beer. Taste is boozy at first. Sweet whiskey booze with lovely toffee and vanilla flavors. Light cherry flavors with some delicious plums, dates, and raisins. Toffee finish with a bit of burn. Mouthfeel is a little on the light side. I wish this beer had a bit more body to it. Drinkability is fairly high for such a big beer. Definitely a sipper though. Overall, I think this is a very tasty brew that I will definitely age to see how it progresses. I must say that I like Parabola and Abacus/Sucaba a little bit more though."
""
""
"Overall: I was disappointed by DDBA. It is certainly a good beer but, it is not a great beer, and I would not buy it again. In this style (barrel aged strong ales), I find Fremont’s Bourbon Barrel Abominable Ale to be infinitely better balanced and more complex."
""
"O - A most excellent beer that will likely age gracefully into a more complex and rewarding fine liquid. At 12%, this one drinks remarkably easy and very filling. Drink it responsibly at home, with good company."
""
""
""
""
""
"T: I wasn't sure about how this one would taste because I'm really not a fan of DBA. But this is pretty good stuff. Lots of bourbon, oak, vanilla and caramel with some hints of dark fruit and just a hint of hop resin. A drying finish leaves a warming hint of booze. Mouthfeel is a bit thin, but holds up to the bourbon and high alcohol pretty well. Really glad I got to try this."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: My friend and I got this beer for $20 and it feels like we paid little for a bottle bourbon, but it is not actually bourbon. It is an intriguingly flavored beer but it is still a bourbon-flavored beer and if you like bourbon or the taste in general (the after-burn), this is the beer for you, if not, it might be hard to enjoy, because of the strong bourbon smell and flavor."
""
""
""
""
"22oz bottle $14.99 Picked this up off the strength of all teh Anniversary beers, Parabola, and Abacus. I figured it would not let me down but I was mistaken. Dark amber color, scant head. Aroma is booze and oak and more booze, meh. Flavor is just real boozy with notes of oak barrels. It really lacks the toasted coconut character I enjoy in their barrel aged beers. For me (and my friend who split it with me) this was a real letdown. I'm just glad I only bought the one bottle."
""
"O: I didn't find the this very remarkable for $14. It's a shade above 'meh.' I just got one and I'll stop there."
"O: I liked it a lot. FW has definitely mastered their skills in barrel aging. Highly recommended. I think this beer could benefit from aging."
"Pours a deep caramel amber with a slight cream colored head. Aroma provides a healthy hit of booze, barrel, some honey, caramel, honey. Flavor follows suit and the booze and barrel strut their stuff in the get go, some honey and toffee that leads to a vanilla caramel in the finish. Fuller bodied, slight activity. Overall, I quite enjoyed this one a lot though it would have benefited from a lessening of the heat."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Fantastic."
"The body was very good, smooth, well-rounded and full. It slid across the tongue very easily for such a big beer. Drinkability was excellent, especially considering this brews 12% ABV, several would go down too easily. Overall, a great beer, most certainly a must try. Might worth laying a few bottles down."
"O - Maybe I need to compare this to regular DBA, but this is not a balanced beer. Too much wood and not enough smoothness. Weird."
""
"- This beer is nice after the whole process. I doubt that I would like the base beer that much, and to be honest I don't care much for the basic DBA beer from Firestone. I find most to be too malt forward. This however is a nice dessert beer with a nice sweet touch. The malt, caramel, and vanilla is solid, but I would still like a little more bitter rather than dry heat from the alcohol... though I'm reviewing this beer a tad fresh. Got another in the cellar."
"Awesome brew! Curious to see what this brew does with time on its hands.. Hopefully it's not the work of the Devil.. Highly recommended. Yum! Right on-point for the style. Nice work FW!!"
"O: Delicious and unique. Like a spicey, white chocolate barleywine. I don't think I've had a beer like this before."
""
""
"Poured into my Figueroa Mountain pint glass for a bit of poetic irony. The beer pours a mildly hazy copper-amber with a light taupe head. The head gives off an orange hue. The head, like all FW brews, subsides nearly immediately. Vibrant notes of coconut, honey, caramel, and bourbon comprise the aroma. The mouthfeel is so soft, creamy, and full that it takes on a life of its own. There's just enough scrubbiness on the top to balance. The mouthfeel is so complimentary to the gestalt of the beer. The flavor, while easily describable, does not lend itself to words for adequate appraisal of how good it really is. A flawlessly engineered combination of bourbon oak, caramel, and honey causes one to be thankful to have had the good fortune to experience it. It finishes with the most perfectly smooth coconut and butter, and, finally, just a hint of alcohol warmth. This may be the best beer I've ever had."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a slightly murky dark brown with a foamy beige head that settles to small dots of foam on top of the beer. Small dots of lace also form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, brown sugar, caramel, vanilla, wood, and bourbon. Taste is much the same with the bourbon really coming through in the aftertaste. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer with a great smell but I think it needs to sit for a little while for the flavors to mesh together a bit better."
""
""
"Overall this is the best beer I have had this year. This would be a straight all 5s beer if the alcohol was a little less noticeable, aging might fix that. Stashing two bottles of this away for Christmas!"

"O: This is a good strong ale, although I prefer more complexity. If allowed, I would score all categories at 3.75"
""
""
"The 2 BA's below reviewed the beer as standard DBA and the reviews are incorrect."
"Poured from a bomber into a pint glass, the beer pours with a thick, foamy, dense, off-white head and a crystal clear ruby-copper coloring that is infested with bubbles, a sign of the high carbonation. The beer has caramel sweet aromas, mixed with cut grass and semi-sour notes. Also, slightly toasted characteristics are present. The flavors are toasted, both caramel malty sweet and a hint of bitter hops. Everything has a toasted feel to it. There is also a hint of dark chocolate buried way in the background. The beer itself is dry and crisp in mouth, and the aftertaste is slightly sour and dry. The finish is quick, and there is little to no linger in mouth, making this an easy one to continue to drink. Flavors lack a little body and staying power, and there are other Strong Ales I would lean towards."
"Goes great with tri-tip sandwiches, fries, and ranch, but also with fresh local greens."
"This was a great beer. Pretty easy drinking but still a sipper. The alcohol heat is nice and mellow here yet present enough to remind you that it's a 10% beer. It really is like an ""Imperial DBA"""
"Rich bodied with a low level of carbonation. Malty start that lasts through the swallow. Good hop to provide balance. The aftertaste mostly bitter but well balanced."
"F: FInishes somewhat bitter with some lingering spicy and floral hops, as well as a little pine. Still somewhat sweet, but dries a bit. A little lingering malt and toasty flavors as well as that barrel and oak flavors. Very drinkable for 10%, you can barely notice the alcohol."
"D: im into my second pint of it and i could keep on going. great session beer. the flowery hops get slightly overwhelming to the palette, my only complaint"
"Well done."
"Drinkability: Pretty damn weird, but still good on the whole. I'd like to try a full pint sometime."
"I think I prefer the garden variety version of this one; Double Double Barrel is taking a good, sessionable beer and kicking it up in ABV. Which sort of ruins its sessionability. On second thought, this is more or less a barleywine (and not really an ""imperial special bitter", as the label asserts), so why not? Fine piece of work from Firestone."
"Pours a lightly cloudy dark orange/brown, decently thick off white head forms, quickly settles to a thin ring around the glass, some lace spots stick. Smell is nice, very malty, caramel and raisin, dark fruit, oak and bourbon, some vanilla, earthy, almost herbal hoppiness to it, some alcohol but decently hidden. Taste is similar, huge and malty, toffee, raisins, alcohol, bourbon, oak and vanilla, nice dark fruit, again an herbal bitterness that makes me think of this as more an imperial ESB than a barleywine, nicely balanced in the finish. Mouthfeel is full bodied with low to medium carbonation, a sipper but pretty smooth considering whats going on in it. I liked this one."
"D: Far too easy to drink for a 10% beer, stealthy. Recommended; should be served in small doses or risk getting carried away."
"D - Minimal heat, great flavor, very easy drinking for a 10% brew. Reminds me a little of Struise Rocking Horse but without the amazing hop flavors."
"D: A very full-bodied, strong beer, a sipper for sure."
"D - Extremely drinkable."
"This beer was well suited to the cask. Would drink again."
