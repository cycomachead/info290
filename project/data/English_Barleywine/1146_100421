Smell- beautiful and blended smells of vanilla, oak, bourbon, toffee, more dark fruits as it warms, and caramel, reminds me of its stout brother. Taste- wow, just wow. For a bottle with no age on it, it blends so well with some alcohol presence. Starts with a smooth vanilla and caramel which gives way to plenty of malt, oak, tobacco, dark fruits and bourbon, finishes with a nice hop presence temporarily which gives way to a creamy and boozy finish. Mouthfeel- holy crap, this is one of the best if not the best mouthfeels I've ever had with a beer. So syrupy and creamy, very dangerous, I really think I could session this with ease which is surprising given what it is. Overall- an amazing experience. I'm really surprised, I like this way better than bcbs, and I'm more of a stout guy. This lives up to the billing.","ER527","Feb 01, 2015"

The aroma is strong, boozy with vanilla and oak notes. Taste is unexpectedly as smooth as it is complex. It's boozy and very sweet. The bourbon barrels really come through again with those same oak and vanilla notes. There is also an element of dark dried fruit (raisins/figs). As it warms, the bourbon aspect becomes even more prominent. The feel is absolutely perfect, it's creamy and full-bodied, and it sticks to your mouth. Carbonation is perfect. Honestly, this whole experience borders on perfect. It's hard to imagine improving this beer, I just wish I could get more of it.","ZebraCakez","Beers"

4.33,-4.4,3.25,4,4.5,4.75,4.5,"Deep, dark brown color.  Despite the solid hiss when prying off the cap, it pours with an almost still look, only a slim tan head forming before quickly dissolving to a fine collar.  Smells highly oaky right out of the gate before giving way to brown bread, molasses, dates, nuts, and raisins.  The wood mellows out a bit as it warms, developing more sticky breadiness, cherry, and slight oxidation. Flavor is less wooden, which is a definite improvement.  Rich, malty flavors like figs, dates, toffee, raisin bread, tobacco, and chocolate coated in coconut and vanilla Bourbon notes.  Sweet, but complex and layered.  Amazingly silky, oily feel that is chewy, if not super thick (which is fine by me).  Not a huge fan of the aggressive barrel in the nose, but the flavor and mouthfeel are excellent.  Accomplishes being rich and decadent without being cloying or hot.  Excellent!","wedge","Dec 30, 2014"

Taste is much like other BC ales that smack you around with the intense sweetness unlike many others.  Syrupy with dark fruits, toffee, caramels, and more oaky-vanilla notes.  Feel is creamy, somewhat boozy, and silky smooth.  Obviously, a very solid BA barleywine.  Right there with Sucaba, but a step or 2 below Straight Jacket for me.","Bosoxfan20","0"

Flavor is not near as boozy as the smell. Lots of great dark fruit notes with a mild alcohol burn. Very conolex flavors. Definitely a sipper. Although this is not my favorite style, I did enjoy this beer. Definitely some unique, rich flavors. Worth the price to pick one up if you can get it.

4.25,-6.2,,,,,,"Bottle: Poured a deep murky brown color ale with a medium size foamy head with medium retention and limited lacing. Aroma of toffee, heavy caramelized malt notes and some vanilla and bourbon notes. Taste is also dominated by loads of toffee and caramelized notes with a healthy dose of residual sugar notes with some nice bourbon and vanilla notes. Body is quite full with a good amount of carbonation with light warming alcohol notes. Very well brewed with nice balanced with the barrel-aging notes. Maybe a tad too much residual sugars.","Phyl21ca","Nov 19, 2014"

To be sure, people have said that KH has fallen off a cliff, but the bottle we opened was still in excellent shape and we enjoyed it immensely. Compared to the King, this one has more oak and toffee in the flavor, while it is also smoother and creamier in the feel. KH in a bit sharper in the barrel and alcohol flavors at this point and there is a hint of bitter pure chocolate that lends some nice balance. In any case, this is a quality barleywine and I wish Goose Island could somehow produce their stout with the same creamy feel that they’ve pulled off here. Good stuff, and would gladly drink more. Cheers Doops!","Jeffo","0"

The nose is big, boozy, sweet and decadent. Leather, caramel, toffee, brown sugar, molasses, jaggery - all kinds of sweetness - is present. Bourbon character is shockingly mellow given this beers siblings. Vanilla and rum; a little bit of oak and char are present. Moderately fruity with plums and raisins present. Yum. The palate opens with a big sweetness and a moderate heat. In the vein of an English BW, Thankfully, not as prune-heavy as King Henry was. Caramel, toffee, brown sugar, a little bit of burnt sugar, a little earth and leather are noticeable, along with a blend of raisins and dates deglazed with rum. Vanilla, a little oak, some rum and bourbon character are present. A dusting of cocoa is present, particularly in the way the roasted malt flavors play off the fruity and sweet flavors. Full in body with a soft carbonation, this beer has a long, sweet finish with caramel and toffee dominating. Excellent stuff","DefenCorps","Beers"

4.3,-5.1,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"12 ounce bottle into snifter, bottled on 9/17/2013. Pours hazy/cloudy very dark brown color with a small tan head with poor retention, that reduces to a ring of lacing. Slight spotty lacing clings on the glass, with a light amount of streaming carbonation retaining a bit of a cap. Aromas of big raisin, prune, fig, caramel, toffee, toast, brown sugar, molasses, vanilla, coconut, oak, bourbon, light tobacco, and toast/oak earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark malt, fruitiness, and bourbon barrel notes; with good strength. Taste of big raisin, prune, fig, chocolate, caramel, molasses, toast, brown sugar, toffee, vanilla, oak, bourbon, coconut, light tobacco, and toast/oak earthiness. Light earthy oak bitterness/spice on the finish; with lingering notes of raisin, prune, fig, chocolate, caramel, molasses, toast, brown sugar, toffee, vanilla, oak, bourbon, coconut, light tobacco, and toast/oak earthiness on the finish for a while. Fantastic complexity and big robustness of dark malt, fruitiness, and bourbon barrel flavors; with a fantastic malt/barrel balance and zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Light carbonation and very full bodied; with a very creamy, slick, and fairly syrupy mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is an outstanding barrel aged barleywine. All around awesome complexity, robustness, and balance of dark malt, fruitiness, and bourbon barrel flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the ABV. A highly enjoyable offering.","superspak","Sep 05, 2014"

Nose is malt, caramel, whiskey and cigar with background notes of brown sugary sweetness. Taste follows the nose..slow and sweet with just a little heat. Flavor is buttery and rich. Mouthfeel thick and gratifying. Overall, an outstanding barleywine with a lot to offer for the style.","fgmiele","Jul 30, 2014"

All three (this one, the cherry rye, and the coffee) of the goose island specialties were spectacular, but for me, this one took the cake. I would be interested to see how this beer develops, however it would be a tough task considering it was so epic at this stage. One of my favorite beers I have had the pleasure to try this year.","minterro","Jul 30, 2014"

5,10.4,5,5,5,5,5,"Poured into a wine glass. This is just amazing... pour is pitch brown, low carbonation. Once swirled, a short lived head forms to release the aroma. The booze is well hidden in both the aroma and taste. I smell dark fruit, strong sweet licorice, vanilla. Taste is licorice, oak, with a lasting raisin on the mouth. Mouthful is full, slightly sticky. Overall this beer is perfect! Bought 3 4-packs and am cellaring 2 packs, can't wait. I also plan on doing a side by side with other barleywines.","arlo19","Jun 20, 2014"

Had this alongside a King Henry and it held its own, though KH is starting to show its sherry-like oxidation notes, so it may not be an entirely fair comparison.The barrel on KH is certainly more ""alive"". It has more character and is surprisingly boozy after 2.5 years. BCBW is a bit better rounded, though. I guess that's a roundabout way of saying that BCBW is every ounce the beer that KH is. GI has become shockingly good at this game, and I hope they continue to play in this sandbox. BCBW isn't just one of the best releases of 2013, it's one of the best English BW's ever made. If you missed out on this in 2013, make sure you don't sleep on it this fall. Standing ovation.","siege06nd","May 25, 2014"

4.54,0.2,3.5,4.5,4.75,4.5,4.5,"Overall I thought this was a great beer and I thought it was a great example of the style, it had everything that I look for in the style plus a little more and it didn't leave me disappointed in the slightest. This beer had good drinkability, it was fairly smooth, rich, a little sticky, almost slightly cloying, a little filling and the taste did a great job at holding my attention, I could drink a bottle by myself with no problem and it tastes so good that I would be pretty tempted to drink a couple of these in a row and If I had a lot I might do that. I think it makes for a great fall and winter time beer, it feels like it would keep me warm in the cold weather. What I like the most about this beer was how good the taste and aroma were and the great mouthfeel helped take this beer to a whole new level. What I like the least about this beer was appearance, it wasn't bad and I liked the color, but the head, lacing and retention were disappointing. I would for sure buy this beer again if I ever saw it and I hope it shows up at some of my local beer stores next year. I would recommend this beer to just about anyone, it's just one of those beers that you just have to try. All in all I was very happy with this beer and I was also a little impressed, I was already expecting this beer to be great and it ended up exceeding my expectations. I am really happy I decided to seek this beer out, this Bourbon County series has all been great. This is now my favorite Bourbon Barrel Barleywine, it's that damn good and it's up there as one of the better goose Island beers I've had, I still think I liked the regular and the coffee version slightly more, but that doesn't take away how great of beer this is and as it stands it's pretty much my ideal Bourbon Barrel Barleywine. Goose Island is really bringing the heat when it comes to these limited releases. Awesome job guys, this was one great beer, keep up the great work.","StoutHunter","May 14, 2014"

There is some old caramel-toffee (aroma) and candy (taste) that is commonly associated to barleywines but it ends there. The barrel presence is very strong with bourbon and vanilla, then mollasses and anise from the regular BCS. The final result reminds me of american strong ales or old ales with tobacco, figs and graham cracker. Obviously very sweet along but also bitter. Rich and low carbonation.

The alcohol has a nice warming effect but it's not too boozy and has a nice carbonation level. Silky smooth with a nice warming and slightly bitter finish. Nice drinkability and a slow sipper. Great beer, thanks BBG for sharing. You're the man and you'll always be the BBG on some level to me.","AndyAvalanche","Apr 17, 2014"

4.59,1.3,4,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"It's too bad that I don't have more of these - I'd love to see how this would develop over time and witness how the barrel character would probably shine through. The fruits are just at the right sweet spot at this point, although I'd imagine as they fade and taste drier that they will compliment the earthier barrel flavors even better as it ages. Nevertheless, in terms of something that I could have more often (of the recent GI releases), this is by far my favorite. Whether it will evolve over time as well as regular BCBS is up to others to decide, but it melds together what I love so much about English barleywines and bourbon aged beers and melds it intriguingly balanced and wonderful results. Don't pass this by just because it isn't regular BCBS - this is a genuinely beautiful beer.","magictacosinus","Mar 16, 2014"

Very nice aromas- extremely well integrated aromas of bourbon with brown sugar, vanilla, and slight woody notes combined with a subtle nuttiness and a rounded maltiness. Very nice. The taste is even better with supremely integrated flavors of whiskey and sweet malt, brown sugar and some light bitterness. great depth, and a long finish. Very nice indeed! I'll also say that this seems to improve a bit after at least a couple of months in the bottle.","Georgiabeer","0"

4.08,-9.9,4.25,4.25,4,4,4,"Pours a murky deep deep amber capped by a two finger fluffy beige head. Excellent retention, splotchy lacing here and there. Boozy aroma of vanilla, light oak, and rich toffee. Opens with dates, dried black cherries and hints of prune joined by caramel, toffee, vanilla. Finishes with oak, light wisps of bourbon, and general booziness. Slick mouthfeel with some creaminess on the edges. Lighter side of fully bodied. Moderate carbonation, more than expected for a barrel-aged brew. An excellent BA English barleywine, but frankly lacks some depth of flavor displayed by other BA English barleywines that I've rated more highly.","chanokokoro","Feb 17, 2014"

4.53,0,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.75,4.5,"2013. Served at a little cooler than room temp. Pours a very dark, purplish, ruby-brown color with a small, tan head. Scent is boozy, with sweet bourbon, vanilla, and oak. A whole lot of molasses too with black cherries and other dark fruits. Smells very sweet and delicious. Taste is immediately cherry-forward...almost like chocolate covered cherries. Very sweet and boozy. Tons of bourbon heat to it, but sweet vanilla and cherry balance. A chocolatey backbone with a hint of oak molasses. Pretty complex. Mouthfeel is nicely carbonated for this style...not too much...not too little. Drinkability is fairly high, although the heat could use some time to settle. Overall, world-class English-style Barleywine. IMO, drink this beer at room-temp. I had it straight out of the fridge about 2 months ago, and I got SO MUCH more aroma and flavor this time around.","DovaliHops","Feb 12, 2014"

4.42,-2.4,3.5,4.5,4.5,4.25,4.5,"worthy of all the high praise, this is a social barleywine with a great bourbon complexion and so much body it drinks like syrup. the looks are the only part that didn't really turn me on, dark mahogany in color with almost no head, and even a vigorous twirl of the glass can't arouse one. thick and dense and viscous. the nose is very sweet, tons of layers of grain and sugar, but also a great deep char and vanilla aspect from the barrel, not unnecessarily complex, but dynamic to say the least. i feared a sugar bomb that would be close to undrinkable, and almost immediately wished i had shared the bottle, but after the first sip it eased up a bit, temperature helped it unfold, and by the bottom of the glass i was wishing for more. a toffee style sweetness starts off a long flavor journey that bounces from toasted marshmallow to vanilla extract to charcoal and rum raisin cake. some spice to this, classic english ale yeast, a bunch of residual sugar, and not much hops at all. the finish is long and smooth, and while the alcohol is there, it adds a layer rather than distracts. more body than i thought possible, almost gelatinous, slippery and slick, but chewy too. mild carbonation is all it needs. i like this at least as much as the stout, if not more. its a world class beer that showcases the barrel very neatly. id like to have one with some age on it just to compare.","StonedTrippin","Feb 07, 2014"

Sweet, malty aroma, notes of caramel and toffee, balanced by barrel character - woody and slightly boozy, not quite cheesy. Pretty nice overall. Sweetness, wood, and booze fight it out in the flavour too, but now there's a solid bitterness that plays counterpoint throughout. Sugary sweetness, bitterness mid-palate, alcohol warmth, woody astringency, toffee. Low carbonation, full (fairly heavy) body. There's a lot of character here from the barrel aging -- booze and tannins mostly -- balanced nicely by a solid barleywine. Definitely worth trying - more than once.","DrJay","Feb 01, 2014"

Taste: booze soaked peaches in a ton of brown sugar, fleetingly nutty, caramel and toasted brown bread, then earthy with a respite from the sweet, hit with twin splashes of bourbon and vanilla, and finally drying out into a sticky peach and date filled finish.

Everything about this guy is just so, so rich and complex, with layers upon layers upon layers, as you would expect from the BC brand. The first big noticeable difference stylistically is how damn dark it is. It’s like black barleywine status, a la the Sierra Nevada black barleywine from a few years back. While each sip begins and peaks with bright sweetness, much like the standard bourbon county stout, it is through the end and aftertaste of the sip where this beer really begins to take its own unique form. The malts sweeten up with warmth, helping to create some cracks in the darkness of themselves, allowing for the fruit and inherent bitterness of booze and wood to shine through. This is where the true complexity of the beer lies, once it all begins to fall into place. The aroma, while intensely rich, roasty, and robust, and hinting at the darkness of the beer, doesn’t quite come to that same level of glory as the flavoring. Again, this is just a treat all around, and although it isn’t quite as sticky, dank, and “forever” as King Henry, we are extremely happy to have been able to track down and consume this beer, especially since we thought it was gone forever.","TheBrewo","Jan 15, 2014"

Not a hint of carbonation which is how I like my BBA English BW's. Insane, sticky and drippy legs as it swirls around the glass. Dried figs, raisins, vanilla beans, bourbon, caramel covered cherries, mulled winter spices and honey. Picking up lovely stout notes and hints of banana. Deep, dark, naughty fruit! Uplifting vanilla and honey sweetness. Sweet bourbon, charred malt, and a hint of tangerine/nectarine citrus. Tastes of cherries, figs, and vanilla beans dredged in caramel covered semi-sweet chocolate. Subtle notes of tangy citrus peel, oak, cocoa, coffee and even more dried fruit. The bourbon pokes in and out between each sip and the finish. Sticky honey sweet! It runs down, and coats your throat with each sip. So thick and delicious!!! GI has definately perfected the English Barleywine!!! It's may not be KH, but it's one hell of an attempt!!! Damn near perfection!!!","Thickfreakness","Jan 11, 2014"

I'm impressed by the depth of color, head retention, and near-oily lacing. The nose is a prominent boozy brown sugar/caramel vanilla bourbon woodiness. The taste brings the same notes/flavors full force, moving towards a nice balance between sugary sweetness and booze as it warms. I notice a bit of pruney dark fruit and chocolate in the taste compared to the nose. The mouthfeel is big, full bodied as expected with a great sweetness tamed only by the biting booze and the slightly tannic bitterness. I'd say this beer is worth a try, which is profound considering how I generally feel about the style and the steep $/oz ratio. However, I'll probably pass on it in the future.","ThePorterSorter","Jan 10, 2014"

This one doesn't. It stays on track. There's some activity, and it gets right to the edge of where it would veer off, but it keeps on track. That's very nice and welcome, and tantalizing at the same time. It's hard to even really compare this with other barleywines because it seems like such a different animal. I like it much better.","BrownNut","Jan 07, 2014"

4.26,-6,4,4.25,4.25,4.5,4.25,"The beer pours a dark, ruby-brown with a fluffy off-white/nearly tan head of large, soda-like bubbles. The head is surprisingly large, but quickly fizzles away to a nice fat scrim that is continuously fed by carbonation from the bottom of the glass. In the glass, the beer looks pretty much like a stout or imperial porter, the light reddish hue is the only thing that really sets it apart. In body the beer is a very deep, clear ruby that is a few touches away from being opaque. On the nose, the beer is rich and decadent. Spicy bourbon, rich oak tannin, vanilla, coconut, and then thick fudge, molasses bread, plum pudding, and toffee play across the nose. The barrel is strong, but not the overriding character in the nose, which I quite like. With a bit of age the nose of this beer alone could really develop into something quite amazing. As is, the nose is intriguing, boozy, and rich. On the tongue, the beer tastes decadently sweet with a touch of acidity that gives a pop. The finish is rich alcohol that becomes only a touch hot and solvent-like in closing, but does dry out. Very soft bitterness from both tannins and herbal hops can be felt in the middle and finish of the sip some of the sweetness. In flavor, the beer begins as spicy wood, blooming into rich bourbon soaked molasses bread, brown sugar, fudge with bits of toffee in it, and plum pudding. Touches of dry raisins float across the palate and the bourbon flavors definitely suggest soft vanilla, as well. The finish bring rich dark fruits, a touch of banana, and fudge beside spicy alcohol and just a touch of solvent. The beer is decadent, boozy, and delicious. I wish there was a little less booze, but I think age would definitely help with that problem. In the mouth, the beer feels full, and oozingly smooth. Little to no carbonation can be sensed, and the mouth is left tingly with booze but still wet in the cheeks, though the tongue feels a bit dry. Overall, I am quite surprised by this beer. I like bourbon barrel aged barleywines, but they aren’t really my favorite thing. This one, however, is rich and full of malt character that I really enjoy. The bourbon flavors are light and perfectly complement the other flavors. With a little more age, this beer will be delicious. This beer is worthy of a try for sure.","Maxwell","Jan 07, 2014"

Sweet bourbon with a soft woodsy aroma atop the caramel brown sugar and vanilla contained within. Light plum and cherry fruits with a hint of earth and ethanol round out the nose. The flavor is brown sugar toffee and caramel maltiness upfront before the sweet bourbon and a twinge of ethanol remind you this is one serious brew. Light vanilla and hints of pitted fruits round out the flavor nicely. Medium to thick body with a light level of carbonation and a sweet sticky mouthfeel. That is a really nice barleywine right there!","johnnnniee","Dec 31, 2013"

This is a very large and rich BW that lands very heavy on the barrel side and finishes sticky-sweet. The finish was actually very similar to the Coffee varietal - just entirely too sweet in my opinion. There aren't many other bad things to say about this beer - smooth and a pretty optimal booziness, rich caramel malt, sticky caramelized brown sugar. Very good stuff, but my first reaction was that there are plenty of peers in this class, with Central Waters BBBW remaining the breadwinner in my opinion (and at half the price).","dirtylou","Dec 29, 2013"

I poured the beer do find a dark brown beer with little head that faded quickly, the beer was slightly hazy as well. The aroma was subtle, malty, some vanilla and dark fruits. Nothing spectacular or out of the ordinary for a barrel aged beer so far. This beer tasted plain. It was syrupy and strong but really lacked complexity. Over all I would have to say this was a disappointing beer. I am not sure if I had to high of expectations or if it really is just meh, but I can say there are several much better barrel aged beers out there.","br3wmeister","Dec 29, 2013"

The nose is heavenly for a Barleywine lover like myself Lots of dark fruits, bourbon, and oak along with hints of figs, toffee, raisins, and sweet brown bread. The taste is just as amazing and mirrors the nose. Oak, dark fruits, vanilla, molasses, black cherries, maple, toffee, with some subtle chocolate and licorice notes. The mouthfeel is thick and syrupy and velvety smooth with a nice subtle warming finish. It's amazingly not hot or boozy for a 12% ABV beer, but I'm still going to cellar a couple of these and see what happens. Overall, this may not be quite in the same league as King Henry, but it's pretty damn close and way more available. Another classic offering from Goose Island!","beerdrifter","Dec 24, 2013"

However, there is no attempt at balance, and the malt sweetness is allowed to run amok. It builds to near sickly, cloying levels. At times it feels as though I'm drinking straight molasses.

4.36,-3.8,4,4.25,4.5,4,4.5,"12oz bottle with a Bottled On date of 24Sep13. Pours a murky dark brownish color with no head. The aroma is a big whiff of bourbon with some dark fruits, earth, dark cherries, and maybe a hint of vanilla. The taste is bourbon upfront that mellows a bit and gives way to the dark cherries and earth. Plums, raisins and malts. Almost has a faint cola taste in the background, maybe even Cherry Coke. Warming alcohol with earth and dark cherries at the end. This one wasn't as boozey as I expected it to be, but there is certainly a big alcohol presence. Slick but heavy mouthfeel. When I heard there was going to be a Bourbon County Barleywine I was pumped. It did not disappoint. Overall, amazing.","PicoPapa","Dec 14, 2013"

There is a slight alcohol taste but nowhere near 12%, it is hidden very well and halfway in it is not showing any heat or bourbon taste, yet the barrel influence is apparent. Overall I was not sure what to expect except the stout that previously resided in the barrels may have added to the flavor. I recommend this to anyone who considers themselves a fan of the style...I only wish I had purchased more - Kudos on a phenomenal beer that exceeded my expectations Goose Island!","Slatetank","Dec 12, 2013"

At this level of quality the less significant (nitpicky) aspects of the brew start coming into play, and the BCB Barelywine comes up a little short of perfect. There's a distracting, abrupt transition early in the flavor profile that I'd prefer to have smoothed out, and on net the sweetness is just a shade past ideal. That said the flavor is still outstanding, and the mouthfeel is outrageous, particularly for the ABV.","vfgccp","Dec 08, 2013"

Raisin, molasses, bourbon, licorice, with a hint of chocolate and tobacco. This smells amazing. This is one sweet barleywine. Raisins and molasses hit the palate first giving way to bourbon notes with a sweet chocolate finish. The sweetness mutes the 12% ABV, this beer is definitely a sipper!

Pours the color and clarity of cola with a consistent, half-inch, tan-colored head that sizzles and dissipates towards the shoulders forming a creamy ring. Some lacing present, but no retention. Nose expresses vanilla, butterscotch and ethanol. Taste consistent with nose; however, a bit more sugary and flavorful than suggested by the aromas in the nose. Mouthfeel is medium-light in body, but comes off a little thin for the style. Texture is slightly oily and carbonation, while light and even, could be a little less assertive. Overall, a very good English Barleywine; however, I'm not sure it warrants a 100 rating (as of this review).

3.8,-16.1,4,4,3.5,4.5,3.75,"Pours a dark, opaque near black with a thick but quickly fading dark yellow/khaki head; not much lace or retention. Balanced, restrained nose of oak, burnt sugar, caramel, toffee and molasses. Flavor is overly sweet; barrel heavy with vanilla, brown sugar and syrupy caramel combining with a sticky, malty English BW base. On its own this was interesting but next to a well aged King Henry seemed comically simple and boring. Body is pleasantly viscous and slick with minimal heat in the finish. Not sure this needs much age, but hopefully some time will rejigger these flavors into a more interesting combination. For price and difficulty in obtaining bottles, just go blow your money of BB4D or Central Waters or something.","yourefragile","Dec 07, 2013"

Starts with notes of bourbon soaked raisins, figs, heavy caramel, and notes of BCS peaking through which brings some fudge to the party. Taste starts with caramel and large BCS influence. The bourbon melds vary nicely with the base beer. Tons of complexity in the way of dark fruits, caramel, and chocolate. The finish leans towards the sweet side and has a nice bitter cocoa note on the end. Mouthfeel is big, viscous, and mildly carbonated. Overall, this is right there with King Henry. Granted, it has been a while since my last taste of King Henry, but I enjoy this as much as I remember enjoying King Henry. It's nice to see that Goose brought back the King in a way, I must say that I am well satisfied. I'm also a big fan of this being in 12 oz bottles. It's not everyday that I want to go crack a bomber of a 12% barleywine, but 12 ounces is way more manageable. Delicious!","homebrew311","Dec 04, 2013"

Thin khaki color head with little retention. Huge aroma of bourbon, molasses, red oak, caramel, tobacco, cocoa and wine just to name a few. As the beer warms it goes through several phases with different detectable aromas. Taste is wonderful! Sweet bourbon and oak upfront, vanilla, cherries, banana, and the aftertaste reminds me of a fortified port and sherry. Wonderfully complex. Mouthfeel is heavy and rich. Some moderate carbonation brings some of the lighter flavors to life. Not much booze on the palette but you can feel it in your nose and stomach. Very warming on a winter night!

There is some bourbon with a few notes of BCBS like vanilla and roast. Mostly toffee and dark fruits. The mouthfeel is rich and satisfying. Top notch brew.

Thick, caramel flavors with a nice highlight of bourbon. Oak and vanilla, somewhat of a sherry tinge. The bourbon tends to linger on the palate. Smooth and sticky mouthfeel with a slight booziness.

4.76,5.1,4.25,5,4.75,4.5,4.75,"Pours a murky dark brown color with a thin mocha colored head that leaves behind a very thin ring of lacing. Smells of tons of toffee and carmel, some chocolate, hint of coffee, oak, some vanilla, molasses, bourbon goodness, slight dark fruit. Very complex aroma. Taste is just as complex. Starts with the typical toffee/carmel, as well as dark fruit and molasses. The middle then brings in the outstanding barrel qualities. Oak, vanilla, and bourbon meld into the toffee, carmel, molasses, and dark fruits. The finish is heavenly. Big sweetness from the carmel, toffee, and molasses, along with dark fruits like raisins, vanilla, bittering hops, oak, and a good amount of bourbon. Getting a butterscotch note in there too. Also get bcbs qualities from the barrel, which stands this beer out in terms of ba barleywines. Get some chocolate and roastiness that go really well with all the other sweet flavors. Warming sensation going down, but not really ""hot."" Full body with a creamy and sticky feel to it. Just the right amount of carbonation. I did not think it would, but this definitely lived up to the hype. Glad I was able to pick up a lot of this. An extremely complex and outstanding beer.","brewskis","Nov 29, 2013"
4.33,-4.4,4.25,4.25,4.25,4.5,4.5,"Overall: I had a bottle of King Henry about two weeks ago and the experience is still fairly fresh in my mind because King Henry is still kicking ass if you cellared your bottle properly. I think that Bourbon County Barleywine has a little weaker barrel presence in nose and flavor profile than King Henry, but the mouthfeel seems better than King Henry did fresh. Bourbon County Barleywine is a bit more fruity than King Henry; it seems as though more of the base beer comes through in Bourbon County Barleywine. It also seems that King Henry is a little more barrel forward of an English Barleywine than Bourbon County Barleywine. With all that said... Great effort on this beer and I will gladly seek out more of this beer! Thank you Goose Island for putting a great English Barleywine into a small format bottle and in 4 packs to boot! I dont know of many barrel aged English Barleywines that come in single serve bottles that are at this high of quality! I think that this will also be a good beer to sit on, it should age well. Welcome to the ""Bourbon County"" family Bourbon County Barleywine...hoping that you become a yearly release!","4DAloveofSTOUT","Nov 29, 2013"

4.17,-7.9,4,4.5,4,4.5,4,"This long-awaited treasure actually showed up in mid-Missouri, much to my surprise, and a 4-pk set me back about $18.00. Figured I’d try one fresh and age the rest. The bottled-on date here shows September 24th, 2013. An elevated pour into my Duvel tulip shows a dark walnut beer, crowned with a tan cap which, on account of the pour and the nucleation in the tulip, actually shows a bit better retention than I was expecting. BCB is almost completely opaque, though there are a few garnet highlights at the bottom of the tulip when held to the light. A riot of red and dark fruit notes emerges first, and these are followed by some toasty brown malt notes, a hint of nuttiness, and faint notes of whiskey and wood. Perhaps a ghostly note of burnt molasses as this approaches room temperature, possibly from the BCBS contribution. On the palate, this shows strong notes of booze up front. The booze stops just short of being hot and, if it weren’t for the intense flavors and significant sweetness, this might seem a bit over-the-top in terms of alcoholic strength. The flavors are a bit muddled at this point, but there’s sweet, sticky dark caramel, some dark red fruits, just a bit of toasted nuttiness, and just the slightest hint of something I’m not entirely enamored with…perhaps just a slightly metallic edge to the molasses flavors (something readily apparent in many high-octane imperial stouts, including BCBS, when young) but I’m guessing that this will mellow with age. Rich, thick, boozy mouthfeel. Rich almost beyond description. Is it King Henry? Not quite. But this is a damn fine English-style barleywine, and one which I have no doubt will improve","BedetheVenerable","Nov 29, 2013"

4.84,6.8,5,4.75,4.75,5,5,"This great idea by Goose Island pours a rich and full bodied dark, dark charred rosewood in color with a one finger, very creamy one finger beige head. As the beer pools in the glass it actually comes just short of being black. If you saw it from a distance you could easily mistake it for an imperial stout. It fully coats the glass and possesses a good amount of residual sugar. The nose is actually very similar to Bourbon County. It is a touch sweeter and and lacks the complete richness that accompanies Bourbon County but I can say that it certainly doesn't smell too much like any other barleywines out there (King Henry excluded of course). The stout influence is impressive. The beer is big and rich. It features big, sweet malt with candied sugars, chocolate, and a touch of roast and drinks like it is half Bourbon County. It has a lot of flavor. I love how much the Bourbon County influence shows itself in the aftertaste as well, resonating for a few minutes. It drinks full bodied and is very smooth. It isn't hot at all (unlike King Henry when it was released). This is a very well rounded, and polished, beer from Goose Island. I'm very impressed. I'm sure this will be all that most people could imagine a Barleywine could be.","aasher","Nov 24, 2013"
