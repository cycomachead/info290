"2010 vintage. I consider myself lucky to have found this at a store only several months ago. I can imagine this being too hot when fresh, but nearly five years of aging have given this beer wow factor."
"This seems like a fortified wine, which might work for some and du finitely not for others.  I liked the complex flavors, but did grow weary of the sweetness eventually.  A half pour or sharing may be the way to go.  I assume a newer release would show its alcohol more, maybe a bit less sweet, also."
"Can't say I'm a huge fan."
"Booze bomb! Avery always does it right, toffee, caramels, sugar-sweetness and alcohol fire!"
""
""
"Overall:  Words like spectacular, exceptional, fantastic, incredible, awesome, outstanding, etc., don’t do this beer justice!  It is quite simply, one of the best beers I’ve ever had!  I definitely need to pick up a few more bottles to age."

"I'm a big fan of barleywines but his beer is way too sweet.   It completly overpowers any other flavors and makes the beer hard to enjoy. A couple of sips and you are done."
""

"Way too sweet in order for me to fully enjoy. The nose was amazing with hints of oak and caramel but the taste was a let down.  The alcohol was well hidden though as it did not overwhelm the drinker for such a huge beer with the March 2014 release."
"Looks good, smells good, but waaaay too sweet for me.  Couldn't finish the bottle and upset that I paid so much for a single bottle of this beer"
"Pours an amber color with a thin white head.  Smells like butterscotch and caramel, perhaps some apple-y oak.  Taste is very sweet, almost Creme Brulee sweet.  Buttery apples and cranberries, caramel, brown sugar, hint of oak.  Perhaps this is par for the course for an English barleywine (doubt it after experiencing BCBBW), but it was very sweet with not enough bitterness to balance it out."
"I was extremely excited to get this beer. I was extremely let down when I drank this beer. This should be some sort of flavored malt, or gimmick drink. It is not a beer, and no way in hell is this a barley wine. It tastes like half the bottle is pancake syrup, it is so sweet. I split half a 12 oz. bottle with a friend and we both struggled to finish it. The 2014 brew clocks in at 14.8%, and for the exuberant amount of money they charge for this beer it is a huge let down. Don't let curiosity kill your wallet, IT IS NOT WORTH IT"

"Overall I thought this was a nice beer and a nice example of the style, it had some pretty nice flavors going on, but it seemed like for every good aspect there was a bad one and that just held this beer back from being a standout for the style. This beer didn't have good drinkability, it wasn't the smoothest, it was warming, not crisp, syrupy, sticky, fairly cloying, filling and the taste did a nice job of holding my attention, but the sweetness didn't, half the bottle is the perfect amount for me, I might struggle to make it through a whole one just because of the sweetness.  What I like the most about this beer was the malty caramel flavors and the nice flavors and aromas that oak imparted.  What I liked the least about this beer was the sweetness it was just way to sweet for me.  I might buy this beer again and i think I would attempt to cellar one to see how it ages and if any of that sweetness fades away over time.  I would only recommend this to people who enjoy really sweet and really strong beers.  All in all I'm glad I tried this beer, but I didn't love it, I just found it to be pretty rough around the edges, but it did have some really nice flavors and aromas to it.  This isn't my favorite beer from or Avery or my favorite of the style, it falls in the middle in both aspects.  I appreciate the effort it took to make a big beer like this, but the super high sweetness just isn't for me, better luck next time guys."
"a drain pour tried to let get room temp made it through about half just way to sweet almost over powering sugar"
"Malty and very strong! A great sipping beer and great on tap!"

"Overall the texture is very rich and satisfying, just the fact that the flavors are a mess and a jumble detracts from the overall experience.  This beer is not drinkable and very disappointing as I am a huge fan of Avery and love many of their beers immensely.  I highly recommend avoiding this one."
""
"While this Hades-tempting offering may be a bit young (all the better, eh, Beelzebub?) at this point in time, it's still a pungent, palate-punching mouthful.  The thing is, other than the lurking, erupting alcohol heat, I can't imagine the rest of this changing all that much after any amount of long-term aging.  And that's why I don't feel bad about having opened it now."

"O- You might as well buy a fifth of spirits, because this is not a very interesting beer to try. Way too much booziness and not a whole lot else adding to any complexity. My guess is that this would improve with a LOT of time, so it may very well need to be cellared."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - I was shocked to see the low ratings for this brew. Don't let that sway you...this stuff is great. The almost complete lack of bitterness makes this somewhat unlike a beer, closer to a port wine or sherry. Like liquid candy in a glass (with a kick)."

"Overall: As the guy before me mentioned, I find this one to be rated fairly low. I see how people could find this a little too sweet, but there are plenty flavors to be savored underneath the sweetness. This is the strongest beer I've had and expected it to be boozier. I had no problem finishing the 12 oz snifter. I was pleased with this one. Good job Avery!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"I really enjoyed this beer. I was actually surprised to see its ratings here as I think they are low. It is a sweet beer and that my be surprising for some, but along with the sweet it has strong and layered flavors."
""
""
"O: Tasty brew but tends a bit sweet for my palette. The addition of some more hops would be welcome here."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Bit sweet and more than a bit heavy. Feels a bit like malt liquor, but there's certainly more complex sugars there to be enjoyed."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Tastes sweet sweet sweet! Dark fruit dipped, or soaked I should say, in sugar. While the sweetest beer I've ever tasted, I do enjoy the way the caramel and oak work together. The alcohol stays more well hidden than I figured it would, as each sip brings mostly the sweet plummy oak flavors, while the hops are less prominent. Syrupy. You may enjoy this to a point, as an after dinner sipper, if you can get past the cloying aspect."

"This is a truly phenomenal beer. The complexity is there, and there's so much to explore. More: there's some really interesting characters that you don't expect even for this style of beer. Even more still: it manages to be phenomenally well balanced, meaning it's supremely drinkable despite the weight. I genuinely love this beer—it's at the very peak of the craft."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-I like sweet beers and this is definitely a sweet beer, so it gets decent marks from me. It drinks more like a fortified wine or port than perhaps any other beer I have ever had. Thus, it makes for a good dessert drink if you are ready for the sweetness and are into sipping and sharing, but I don't know when else I would drink this."

"Overall: I am glad it's only a 12 oz. it too sweet to drink too much. I enjoyed it though."
""
""
""
"Overall: very strong and flavorful beer, on the edge of being harsh and astringent. would love to see this with some age on it. definitely plan on taking a while on this one. it is a big intense beer"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Quite boozy, and exceptionally sweet, I can see why there's a relatively small amount of beer drinkers this appeals to. I do think it's pretty good, though."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: An interesting beer for sure. Complex and something you can keep tasting and finding new flavors in."
"Rarely do I come across a beer I can't finish, but this was one of them. Maybe I just am not accustomed to this, but I couldn't do it. There were hints of Oak in the taste and smell, but sadly, the turbinado sugar is what I tasted mostly. In fact, the whole thing tasted like sugar. too much sugar. this could have been good if they would just have toned down the sugar. I finished maybe a quarter of it and could not go one further. In fairness, I am sure some will really like this. For me, no. Still, in fairness, I couldn't give a flat out horrible rating. This beer is better than that. But for my taste, it just didn't cut it."

"taste is sweet with the expected alcohol burn. no bitterness, except for the alcohol, and a bit syrup-y. reading lots of different adjectives from everyone here and applying them to my experience. seems, though, the higher ratings are for bottles which have aged awhile. this one was produced only 9 months ago. I was wondering if it would mellow a bit sitting in the bottle for awhile?? otherwise, this is how I felt about it: appearance was standard without head but a pretty golden color. the aroma was fantastic but difficult to describe. the taste was not as fantastic, and was also difficult to describe aside from the alcohol. in a nutshell, this is a blast of alcohol and considering the taste of this young version, better to blast ya into buzzdom than to appreciate as a refined source of leisure. it definitely beats 4loco and I don't think there is a hangover associated with it like the 4loco..."

"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass; batch 1, bottled in 2005. Pours moderately hazy/cloudy dark ruby red color with a minimal wisp of a head that reduces to nothing. Aromas of big raisin, prune, fig, plum, apple, pear, molasses, toffee, caramel, toast, brown bread, oak, light chocolate, vanilla, light clove, and yeast earthiness. Damn nice aromas with big complexity and great balance of malt, oak, and yeast ester notes; with big strength. Taste of huge raisin, fig, plum, prune, apple, pear, molasses, brown sugar, brown bread, caramel, toffee, vanilla, oak, light clove, toast, chocolate, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Lingering notes of raisin, prune, plum, fig, pear, apple, molasses, brown sugar, brown bread, caramel, toffee, chocolate, toast, oak, vanilla, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a while. Fantastic complexity and balance of big dense malt, fruity yeast, and oak flavors; with zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Light carbonation and very full bodied; with a very creamy, slick, and moderately syrupy mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is an awesome English barleywine. Big complexity and great balance of malt, yeast ester, and oak flavors; and quite smooth sip on slowly with no booziness. A highly enjoyable offering."
"our 3rd highest average score of the 12 brews tasted at 4.38. At 16.5% its was a very smooth beer."
"4.15 SCORE"
"O: A decent brew. Nothing too exciting and not something I'd be willing to purchase again."
""
""
""
"O: A nice beer but not really worth the price tag. I would actually rather try a fresher version near bottling to see if there is more zip -- this one seems on the way down and a little dead."
"Overall: I was impressed and surprised to find that it was pretty low rated. It could be due to people not sitting on it for a little while causing it to be too hot. I think it could have benefited from another few months of aging. Hopefully there are some left somewhere from the May release because I would like to grab another, so I don't have to wait another 5 months and lose out on that aging time. Very unique. Brendan liked it more than me and would put it in his top 5, I would say its worth a try and would buy again, but not often due to the price."
""
""

"O - A good brew, but really too strong. A 12oz bottle ought to be split and slowly sipped."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is pretty disgusting. Don't drink one that's 6 and a half years old. Smells like sugar-cane husks, salt, and soy sauce. Tastes kinda medicinal and annoyingly sweet. Don't do it. Please. Just don't. Stop. Now. Don't. Please. Please. Please. Please. Please. Please. Please. Please. Please. Don't."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is the type of beer that pushes the envelope. It will probably take you out of your comfort zone. It's a quality experience, but know what you're getting yourself into."
"On the high end of medium bodied, low level of carbonation, this is going to take me some time to finish but when I do, I'll be satisfied, I'm sure. Nice."

"O- Really love it, though I understand how some would not."
""
""
""

"O: I like strong drinks, but this is a bit too heavy on the alcohol to enjoy a full bottle solo. I can imagine sharing this with a friend and enjoying it, but taking down a whole bottle at one sitting by oneself is a daunting task."

"The mouthfeel is medium bodied but this is a serious sipper."

"O: I am very impressed by how they made a fairly tasty, interesting beer with so much alcohol. My favorite beers are lambics, which are almost always between 4% and 6%. I usually wouldn't buy a WINE over 14% ABV (and generally prefer wine that is roughly 12.5%), so this beer is very much out of my comfort zone. The hot alcohol is fairly well hidden, and the beer is complex and very sippable. Bravo."

"Pours a clear reddish brown with a small quickly dissipating white head. Aroma of caramel malt, oak and vanilla esters, very fruity, brown sugar, mild sweet spices and sweet alcohol brandy like aroma. Taste same as aroma. Palate is a full body, sweet spices and alcohol. The finish is sweet caramel, vanilla, yeast and fruity flavors, some oak and vanilla tones, a bit of brown sugar. The ending is mildly spiced with some sweet alcohol. This brew seems to have some a bit of bourbon and brandy notes. A bit rough at the beginning but drinkable"

"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was its taste. This is actually our first taste of the “Demon” series, and it certainly did not disappoint. Samael brought it hard to the palate with massive bready sweetness, nicely matched oakiness, and strong booziness through the end of the sip. While things may have not been the most balanced and concise, the more noticeable inclusions of leather, light smoke, and plastics were happily welcomed to the party, integrating pleasantly amongst the general strength and bigness of this beer. Things calm down quite a bit with warmth, through both the nose and the taste, helping to keep it much, much closer to style and approachable. This guy is monstrous, and considering the abv alone, you should definitely fight off the darkness with some friends, or you just might get swallowed up in it."

"One more of this vintage in the cellar."

"Overall - The nose was quite appealing and some of those flavors held through, but this beer might just be too big for its own good."
"O - I'd pass on this unless you intent to cellar it for at least a year. I can tell there is potential for something epic but you need to give this guy some time to develop."
"The flavor is over-whelming; even as a sipper. This should be poured in small amounts among multiple people. I would say that the strength and body almost work like a brandy/bourbon. I recommend this for a cold night among friends."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Good drinkability for the style. Malt-oriented with a nice oak character. Recommended."
"O: Though it comes in a small bottle, this bottle is really intended for sharing because this is a big beer and the alcohol is not all that well hidden. I recommend slowly sipping this one over a fairly long period of time but it was nice on a cold winter evening. Very nice amounts of complexity."
""
""
""
""
""
"O – This is a pretty tasty English barleywine. It’s got all of the great malty sweetness that you could ask for. The hops and oak are a bit muted, possibly due to age, but I think it might also be due to the higher ABV. The heat may be masking some of the more subtle flavors at the finish. Nevertheless, it’s a tasty beer and very drinkable for one that clocks in at almost 15.5%. This is the last of the Demons of Ale that I’ve tasted, and I’m glad I had the chance to try them all. They were truly an experience."
""
"Very little alcohol heat for such a high abv brew. Amazing aroma but the flavor was super sweet, almost to the point of cloying. The wood was bold and mellow at the same time and gave a very nice aftertaste."
""
""
""
""
"So I was wrong. Surprised at how drinkable it was. Really not much heat at all. I'm sure the 4 years of aging had a lot to do with that though. My first impression was that this reminded me a lot of Sam Adams Utopias in smell and flavor. Obviously it's got a lower ABV and is carbonated, so that's different, but in general it really did remind me of drinking Utopias. Wish I had purchased a few more of these."
""
"Overall: Excellent, I love the level of the bready malts and the sweetness that is as cloying as expected. The alcohol is hidden elegantly."
""
"O: CRIMINALLY UNDERRATED!!! If you live in California, you can probably still find this beer, but it's old, and trust me, very much worth your money and time looking for it. My rating is going to be a bit higher, just because I feel it is so underrated on BA."
""

"[O] Decent sipper. Mouthfeel aside, nothing overwhelmingly impressive. At over a dollar an ounce, this here bottle is probably my last."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I like it, not too familliar with barleywines. but I think this is pretty good. Might even be over aged since it is only 14% abv not the near 16% of later batches."
""
"First, I have to say that I am impressed with how well hidden the ABV is. It was a bit too sweet though so the drinkability didn't become too dangerous as the sweetness slowed me down. The overall flavor was pretty malty but had some nice subtleties like the vanilla notes that snuck through. I really enjoyed this beer, but it was a bit heavy and sweet. It makes a solid after meal drink or sipper in cold months."
"Overall- Absolutely insane. It is quite a beast even with this much age so I think it could hold up to 4-5 more years for the very patient. Definitely a decadent awesome treat."
"O - I contend that there's no difference between trying something fresh before something aged, and trying something aged before trying it fresh. With that said, this is a good BW, one that I'd like to try fresh."
""
"Avery Brewing Company continues to impress. I have liked nearly every single one of their beers that I have tried, but their Demons of Ale series is the top of the pack and ""Samael"" is certainly a worthy addition to the pleasant brutality of that series. Find it, buy it, drink it and revel in the brutality. Cheers."
"O: Let me start by saying that I love big English barleywines. I think there is no better way to finish the day than sipping an old Thomas Hardy's. This beer is great for the style. It is sweet caramel candy, maybe too sweet; you can age this monster for years. It is a sipper, but I was not willing to share, I wanted every drop for myself. If you are lucky enough to find a Samael put it away for a decade and count yourself lucky. Save it for a cold winters night and enjoy."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The beer appears sunburst orange, perhaps a touch of ruby, with very little head. The aroma offers booze, malt, oak, tannic citrus. The flavor is definitely smoother than the fresh bottle I had a few years ago. Lots of oak, very sweet. Fine for sipping, but an ounce or two is plenty. Eh..."
"Overall - almost sickly sweet. This is definitely a very young beer that needs to spend another 2-3 years in the bottle at least to be more enjoyable. I am disappointed that I drank one of my bottles now, as I feel it will have been a waste compared to how this will taste further down the road. Hopefully it turns out to be worth the $9/bottle price tag in 2-3 years."

"This brew poured with half a finger of white head that dissipated relatively quickly for the most part, but a little bit hung around, crowning the body. There wasn’t any lacing left on the glass from the head. The body was a cloudy mahogany color with a lot of active carbonation, more than I was expecting actually. The nose was insanely strong and overpowered with oak. Other things that I got on the nose were toffee and vanilla and a crapload of booze. I have a feeling that this is going to knock me on my ass. The taste started with sweet toffee, then vanilla and then literally beat me in the face with oak and finished with a serious booze burn. The body was towards the thick and syrupy side with lighter carbonation than I expected. The finish was long with a lot of heat. Honestly, all this beer was to me was just really sweet, really oakey and really boozy. This was a bit of a disappointment, especially from a brewery that I love. And, definitely not worth the hefty pricetag."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"One final note - even when aged several years this is a massive beer and is not easy to drink. A single 12oz bottle is more than enough for two people to share."
""
""
"Batch #7, poured into a Founders snifter. Pours a reddish brown color, with a light tan head, about one finger. Head recedes to just about nothing. Minimal cling. Smell is delicious. Sweet caramel, dark fruit, slight woodiness, vanilla, and general sweetness. Smell is similar to Backwoods Bastard, minus the bourbon. Taste is similar to nose, with oak a bit more, and dark fruit a bit less, pronounced. 15.31% ABV well=hidden. Mouthfeel is just slightly burning, and this is where the ABV is most noticeable. Syrup-like texture, but not too overbearing. Overall I like this beer quite a bit. I bought it about 6 months ago and its just been sitting there. Tonight I decided was the night. I'll probably grab it again when I see it, experiment with more aging. This though is pretty good after 18 months."
""
"Big big BIG caramel throughout the taste and long into the finish. The booze is like a punch in the gut.. it's high. Low on carbonation and a viscous almost syrupy body really make the mouthfeel smooth and comfortable. Its not bad overall, would be great with a cigar. I'd probably still buy it again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Except for the mystery floaters (yeast sediment?), this is pretty decent, high ABV barley wine. Bold and assertive across the board, yet pretty well-balanced overall. Complexity is almost an understatement with this beer. Worth checking out, but only in small doses..."
""
""
""
""
"Overall – Overall, it is sweet, flavorful, warming and delicious. This is definitely one to sit back and sip over a long conversation with a friend (or a stranger at a bar that can become a friend). Give it a go if you have the chance."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: a transcendent creation. Avery take a bow."
""
"O: Strange beer, indeed: a powerhouse of booze that remains drinkable, all while being a sugary malt-bomb. If it weren’t for that startling lemon taste, I think I might like it more, but for now I’m glad I only got one bottle (for around $9)."
""
""
""
"Bottle from the shop. This poured a deep dark brown with pretty much no head. Aroma is plenty of harsh booze, caramel, dark fruity raisins. This was hard to finish. Heavy warming alcohol with extreme oak flavor. Roasted grain and maybe some rancid raisin flavor. The oak was just so heavy as to be totally unpleasant for me. I appreciate what was going on here being BIG and all, but unable to finish a 12-ouncer myself."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This was a surprise because I thought the big alcohol content would be more prominent in the taste. But the massive sweetness really keeps it mellow. It’s a big, strong, sweet beer. As the beer warmed up, I did not find much change from the initial aspects. I can see that this brew might be a bit much for one person, but being shared, this beer is very enjoyable."
""
""
"O- A nice effort. Not something I'd look for every day, but a unique Barleywine- style ale that was a pleasant way to wind down an evening. I would purchase this again."
""
""
""
"3.5 D: This is too sweet and boozy for me, but it was worth a try."
""
""
""
"However, it is certainly not a terrible beer either. If you want your eyebrows to light on fire and like to be punched in the face with a fist made out of soft caramel candy that has been rolled around in oak chips, than this is the brew for you."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Body is thick and syrupy, creamy and sweet with very intense flavors. So much so, it reminded me strongly of Colorado whiskies Stranahans and High West Double Rye. Wouldn't be surprised if they used Strananhans barrels/chips, this tasted very similar. Anything more than a tiny sip and you feel an alcohol burn, it's certainly potent at 16%. Took quite awhile to finish the small glass, but it was definitely savored."
""
""
"O - Could have been very good but unfortunately this one has started to turn. I will probably try another from my stash to make sure it wasn't just a bad bottle. Great complexity and smooth. The sweetness is a bit over the top."
"O - Among the best Barleywines I have ever had. Well balanced ABV which makes a fine brew worth seeking."
"D - Definitely a sipper (if you want to endure it). Bordering undrinkable on account of how sweet and alcoholic it is. I'd never have it again."
"High D+"
""
"o - quite a sweet beer. boozy and unique to have such an old beer (5 years). not overly mind blowing but good. def for desert and worth a try...glad i got this one stored away back then :)"
"O - A fun beer to sip on, but I don't see how anyone could handle more than a mini snifter of this beer."
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied for the style with carbonation being above average. Overall, it was a pretty decent beer. The oak and the citrusy flavors came together well enough in it. It definitely made me think fresh peeled oranges on more than one occasion. It did however also feel a little harsh and unrefined at times with the oak and citrus flavors clashing a little."
""
"The oak is barely enough to contain the beast! A truly titanic English barleywine. Drinkable- the 16% is apparent bit not an impediment."
""
"O: Maybe a bit past it's prime but still very interesting to try. Definitely a sweet one but great flavor remains."

"O- An amazing blend of vanilla/oatmeal raisin cookies/dried fruit/maple syrup/brown sugar/and booze!!! This is absolutely rediculous! Other than GI KH... this is the best BW I've ever had!"

"O - This is a drinkable beer. This would be enjoyable on a long winter's night by the fire with a good book. The beer has a slightly raw taste that might be bellowed by a bit of aging."
""
""
""
"O: This is surprisingly drinkable for an almost-15% beer, with the alcohol relatively smoothed out and hidden, so the age has done its job there. Other than that, it's very sweet, cloyingly so."

"Batch 5, April 2009. Pours an almost-clear, reddish amber color with a very small off-white head that disappears quickly. Scent is initially heavy with an inviting oak aroma. A little bit of booze with a ton of dark fruits and a very sweet, candy-like aroma. Tons of malt with some sweet caramel and wood. Taste is initially VERY sweet...this beer tastes like creme-brule... very sweet and desert-like. Sweet dark fruits with some candy-like flavors. A ton of caramel and malt flavors with a nice warming sensation from the high ABV. For how high the ABV is, the booze is nowhere near overwhelming. Solid beer. Mouthfeel is full bodied and a bit on the syrupy side. Drinkability is scary for how high the ABV is. Overall, this is a very solid beer. Glad I held onto it for so long, as I amagine this not being as good when fresh."

"Glad I didn't dish out $9 bones for this one, but it's better than The Beast and I would like to try a fresh one to see how it compares."
""
"Overall, some nice flavours but it is just too strong. Not really sure what the benefit of such a high ABV is. I like English barleywines a lot, and like strong beers, but maybe this would be more enjoyable at a nice sedate 10-12%..."
""
"Overall, a great dessert beer. It's a bit cloying. Couldn't have more than one. Given the abv, I expected more alcohol dominance, but it was not there. Great malt complexity, given the age, and still a touch of bitterness for balance. Glad I have more than one!"
"Palate evolved over time, and this batch has some more age on it... that said, delicious fig and pear impressions, suffused with booze sans the sting of alcohol - smooth, creamy, and dense - sediment particles suspended in a body of dark brown opaque ale... 15.47 abv completely hidden in the goodness. No trace of any oak aging, but that was inconsequential to me. A superior experience that elevated prior scores. Previously, overall score was 3.85. Cheers..."
""
"Pours a murky dark orange with a tan head that settles to nothing. No lacing on this one. Smell is of malt, brown sugar, wood, and citrus zest. Taste is the same with some honey flavors as well. There is a mild bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good barleywine that has aged pretty spectacularly over the past 6 years."

"O- Surprisingly, the best out of the trio. A bit challenging to finish the bottle, but that's what friends are for."

"12oz bottle. Bottled in April 2007, Batch 3, ABV 14.9%. Pours a murky swamp water brown color with sediment floating around. No head. Minimal lacing. Big whiff of alcohol with some dark fruits, and some caramel. Has a bit of a nail polish remover smell. Taste is boozey brown sugar with some dark fruits, vanilla and oakiness at the end. Creamy mouthfeel. This hot, boozey taste along with the sweetness make this a real slow sipper. Can't imagine how hot this tasted fresh. I love barleywines and Im not scared off by high ABVs, but the booziness combined with the sweet brown sugar and dark fruit flavors are almost a bit too much for me with this beer. Overall im glad I tried it, and it was pricey but I wont be buying this again."
"Overall, I quite enjoy this, but it's not amazing. I've never had this beer fresh, so I can't comment on the effect of seven years' aging, but it's still rather tasty after so much time."
"Poured aggressively into a 20 oz giant Duvel tulip, bottled in April of 09. Pours a murky mahogany, with a 2 inch off white head, no lace to speak of. Smell is very strong dark fruits, rum soaked raisins, candy apple, and more sweet booze. Taste is wow. This is massive all the flavors in the nose, with a nice helping of oak and burnt brown sugar and molasses. Body on the large side, a surprising amount of life for the huge ABV, not too dry, and a sipper. That being said, it hides its alcohol well considering. This is a nice giant, a treat for the beer geeks."
""

"Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Pours a deep coppery amber. Two finger fine off-white head with good retention and nice lacing. Looks good. Tempting aroma of oak and caramel malt. Full flavor of caramel malt, sweet dark fruit, dried dark fruit, vanilla and booze. Very smooth and well integrated. Medium to heavy bodied and creamy. I really like this, but had to drink it slowly. The high ABV makes this somewhat of a challenge to drink, but it tastes good."
""
""
""
"O: Yes, I saw right off that this was an English BW: It wasn't too hoppy and was rather understated in that regard. Additionally, the malt bit was caramel-like and very flavorful. I can almost envision the brewer wringing out a log made of oak every day into the brew kettle until the beer was about 45% oak, 35% pure sugar, 19% malt, and 1% hop."
""
""
"Really wonderful and special when one considers the seamless transition of flavors. The overall taste profile really knocks my socks off. I adore the cognac note and am totally down for serious love with a good stilton."
"Overall: Very good beer, but not overall impressed. It appears that if you want just alcohol and not beer this one is for you. I am not knocking it just giving every one the heads up.Salud!"
""
"Pours a murky reddish mahogony color, short livid head forms and dies quickly. Aromas are full of over ripe fruits, strong caramel, butterscotch, loads of toffee, candy, brown sugar and sweet alcohol. In the taste, a lot of the same flavors, caramel reduction, buttery toffee, spicy alcohol, dry oak, tannins, pretty sweet and definitely strong. Mouthfeel is well carbonated and syrupy, full bodied. Overall, a worthy sipper, the flavors stick with you. Intended to be respected."
"Overall Impression- After drinking the Mephistopheles Stout in this same ""Demon's of Ale"" series last Fall, I just had to try this guy. A nice Barleywine but has WAY too much alcohol and booze present. If they dumbed this down to 10% on the ABV's, it may be well rounded and appropriate for the style. Glad I tried this but would like to share 22oz/750mL Barleywines with friends, not 12oz bottles! A bit too harsh for the style."
""
"I'm overly pleased with this bad-boy. I've only got one other, but that's gonna change. I'm about to pick a couple more bottles up. Worth the price. A gluttonous brew from barleywine fans across the world. Avery... +1 on the competition!"
""
"edit: 2014 edition is awesome, a little lighter in alcohol, it needs less cellar time i imagine. so much oak on this, just glorious slow sipping brew. i stay away from it sometimes because even 12 ounces is heavy lifting, but i am reminded again just how good this beer is. top tier strong ale."
""
"Poured into a four once taster glass at Uber Tavern, 2010 vintage. Appearance was dark amber, almost ruby. Lot’s of white head, probably two to three if it was a full pour. Leaves a gentle lacing, pretty viscous. Aroma was boozy but seemed pretty balanced. Taste was a lot of oak, and a lot of booze. Very slight hints of vanilla, cherry, and spice. It seems like the booze gets weaker as it warms, but hits again on the way down. Palate was surprisingly lively for an aged barlywine style. Lots of carbonation for it. Leaves a lingering flavor, mostly oak and alcohol though. Overall I am glad I tried it, but it’s not one of my favorites. There’s a lot going on and I’m not a fan of all of it. I don’t feel there’s enough balance to pull it off. Still very flavorful and I can see the allure to it. They were smart to only pour this in four ounces, this one can be devastating."

"O - Legalpete put it very well a couple of reviews ago - ""a sweet flamethrower."" I thought this was a pretty solid english barleywine, maybe a little too sweet to be one of my favorites in terms of barleywines, but altogether not bad at all."
""
""
""
"I was really disappointed with this beer, as I really enjoyed the others in the Avery Demons of Ale series."
""
"O: Interesting beer. Tough to rate.. It was a sweet flame thrower that kept me interested and drinking but i only had to finish half a bottle. I can see it being a great night cap or dessert beer. One (or half) will always be enough. Strangely drinkable for the ABV."
""
"The flavor is robustly alcoholic up front and sweet on the finish. I much like this. I would guess with a few years, this beer would be outstanding. There is a certain sharpness to it at this time that is a bit detrimental. A good, solid sweet caramel and woody flavor. I don't think this is particularly oxidized, but it tastes slightly so (in a good way). The body is medium with low, smooth carb and a slick finish. the mouthfeel is really spot on for me."
""
"O: This is a nice oak-aged barleywine, and will likely be welcomed by those who are accustomed to having a rich, strong ale after dinner. On its own, Samael is a bit difficult to drink, but still very likeable in its way. I wasn't expecting to like this ale as much as I did, and would have no difficulty recommending it to fans of barleywines in general."
""
""
"Poured into a snifter this ale pours brilliantly clear amber-red with orange/golden hue. The moderate off-white head diminishes to a skim after a couple minutes. A good looking glass of beer. The aroma is highly malty, toffee and caramel as well as a lot of dark fruits, an oaky port-like character is also evident. A very inviting nose. The flavor is a bit sherry-like, cherry and plum fruits, lots of toffee, abundant oak, pleasant flavor and warmth of alcohol. The finish is slightly dry, a prick of alcohol, oaky and warms the belly. The body is medium-full and carbonation also moderate. Overall a delicious, complex beer that was very enjoyable to slowly sip. At $8 / 12oz bottle, it was a great gift, certainly worth a try, but not something that fits into even a semi-routine budget."
""

"O: I wish I had five of these. I would drink one every year and take tasting notes to see how it progressed. Intriguing like the best dessert wines. Almost has a sense of origin about it."

"12 oz bottle from 2005 generously shared by colonelforbin. Pours a deep reddish copper with no head. The aroma is oak, sweet plum, raisin, caramel, brown sugar, molasses, and alcohol. You can definitely tell that this is a sweet, boozy beer. The initial taste is quite sweet with plum and raisin. Then comes oak, some light oxidation, rum, brown sugar, and caramel. The finish is quite boozy with a bit of bitterness. Medium-full body. Close to no carbonation. This beer is quite sweet and boozy, which is certainly not my favorite type of beer, but it is pretty decent for what it is."

"Overall a really nice strong barelywine but rare, expensive, and special. One is a nice experience but I doubt I will buy another."
""
"Overall: A tasty, enjoyable sipper. Definitely not a beer that I'd feel like having more than one of in a sitting, but highly enjoyable nonetheless. Avery did a great job with this one!"
"Overall: This is probably my favorite in the Avery Demons Series. This is a phenomenal beer that should age really well. A vertical of this in 3 or 4 years should be amazing."
"O: This is something that I feel as if needs to be stored for a couple of years for the alcohol to calm down. Every time I take a sip I am just like wow, that's an insane amount of alcohol. This is something that should be passed on especially with it's high price tag of roughly $10 for a single bottle."
"Definitely ""hot", and a sipper. but tasty, and I can only imagine gets better with age."

"Samael's pours an opaque red-orange to mahogany, with just a light bit of cream colored head. The nose has some of the expected elements, but in the end falls a little dull. Specifically, it smells of caramel and vanilla, but the aroma is a bit weak, and could definitely stand to be a bit more varied. The taste though, is just that. In addition to the caramel and vanilla, the flavor profile is rounded off with notes of burnt sugar and alcohol soaked figs and other fruits. Especially that boozy fruit note jumps out with each sip, which I guess is to be somewhat expected given the high octane nature of the beer. Unlike the similarly big Mephaddict I just had, this one comes across as being a bit underattenuated. While the carbonation is dialed in nice and low for maximum maltiness, the body firmly crosses the line into being too sugar-syrupy. The result is that the beer has an almost cloying edge to it. I love me a good English Barleywine, but I think Avery might be served to dial down the intensity on Samael's a bit."
""
""

"Drinkability: This intense sipper is perfect for a cold winter's night and could easily stand more time in the cellar. Not available in my state due to ABV (thanks Jeebus) but I would certainly pick some up if ever I saw it again."

"Overall: I really enjoyed this brew. The big oak flavor is super sweet and layers this ale with a lot of flavors to enjoy. Probably my favorite so far from Avery followed by their IPA."
"Really enjoyed this sipper of a beer. I will have to grab a bottle or two of this the next time I see it. A spendy, but well worth it once in your life beer."
""
"O-- Long term cellaring will pay massive rewards. Cold this is a really good beer as the alcohol is really muted. Once warm this is a beast. Lots of alcohol but this beer has serious potential. Easy to drink and a lot of jam notes even with the alcohol at times. Hard to do a 12 oz bottle on my own or even shared but still quite good."
"Food Pairing- Sticky toffee pudding."
"Samael's Ale is a nice sipping beer with a tasty, complex flavor. It lacks somewhat in other aspects, but is in no way, except it's alcohol presence, objectionable. I can't speak of newer vintages, but can at least recommend aged bottles. It's sort of piqued my interest in Avery's Demon serious, which I'll soon be seeking out."

"I poured from a 12 ounce bottle, april 2011, into a SA perfect pint glass. The pour is a bright amber, very slight white head, no lacing. The aroma is full of caramel, vanilla, and hot alcohol. It has notes of vanilla, oak, caramel and lots of hot alcohol. It has a very hot finish, almost to the oint of burning. The body is medium, carbonation low, very alcoholic. This beer needs to be cellared to calm down the alcohol."
"O-French oak bomb."
"Overall, a poorly done big beer. I can barely tolerate sips. Drain pour."
"These beers are crazy. The look of them isn't too out of the ordinary or anything. The color is a rich looking brownish amber color with a thin tan head on top. The smell of is quite strong, boozy, malty and sweet. The taste of the beer is also like the nose. It was very sweet with a kick of hops and booze in the aftertaste. The mouthfeel is on the thicker side and has a oily quality to it. Overall this beer neds to be sipped. It's big and very bold. Really should be enjoyed over the course of an hour or so, in my opinion anyway."
"Aroma is very enticing, sweet malts with light hints of fruit. Appearance is dark amber brown. Frothy tan head that sticks around and laces the glass. Taste is incredibly complex for how sweet it is. Notes of vanilla and oak with many malt backing and a sweet candy end. For a 15% beer this is dangerously drinkable. Palate is lively and fizzy carbonation.long sweet finish. Overall a fantastic addition to the cellar, I am super excited to try it after it is aged for a year or two."
"O - Definitely a big, boozy monster, but the flavors that are present are quite nice. Not really my thing, but I'm glad to have experienced it!"
"O - For such a big beer, this was VERY drinkable. Dangerously so as I was contemplating another order. But, I refrained. I will definitely seek this one out in bottles to see what age does to it."
"Pours a hazy orange-ish to brown color with a light tan head. In the aroma, vanilla, oaky, and small alcohol note. In the taste, bourbon like, oaky, vanilla, and a small alcohol burn. A smooth and medium bodied mouthfeel, with a adry oak in the aftertaste. It is like drinking bourbon light, a good sipper."
"o - overall, this is a big beer...no, a HUGE beer. it is an english barleywine to the MAX. i am a big fan of these flavors, but they are a bit extreme here, but what would you expect for 16+%"
"Overall: Hot and unbalanced, even after two years, even though there are some nice flavors underneath. I found a case of this on the shelves recently, and so I wanted to see how it was (and if I should get another one). I shall not be."
"O: Overall, very tasty, also unusual. It has a moderate sherry-like component to it, and also, at about 15% abv, it's pretty intense for a beer. This particular bottle probably would have benefited from another 1-2 years of aging at ideal conditions (not that it was aged in ideal conditions at any point in this case). Still, though, there was a significant amount of oxidation aromas and flavors present in the beer. The aroma was somewhat off-putting, but all of the other elements work well together to create an over-the-top Americanized Eniglish-style barley wine."
"O - Good. Actually its quite good. Id love to taste some prior vintages and really look forward to future ones. This beer probably isnt for everyone but I really enjoyed it. Its almost like liquid alcoholic candy. Crazy."
"overall - Something to sip slowly. I was happy to split one regular sized bottle into two servings."
"Amazed at how they packed so much fermentation yielding a >12% ABV that goes unnoticed yet still with huge malts and unfermented sugars to offer such sweetness. Many will detest this beer due to the sweetness, but this one was done right in my opinion."
"O: It's a damn good beer. I purchased my 12 oz bottle for $9, and there are better beers I can get for cheaper, but it's certainly a unique beer and one worth seeking out - for the experience if nothing else."
"O-A really,really nice and approachable ""extreme"" beer.I will definitely buy this again.I could see this paired with a nice Manchego and some Iberico ham."
"Poured into a mini snifter, an oily crimson brown with a creamy off-white head that dissipated almost completely after a minute or so. Sweet nose, lots of fruits and caramel, a bit phenolic. Sweet taste of caramel and toffee candy, oak, dark fruits, mildly hopped for a sense of balance. Alcohol taste is pretty subdued actually, but it's definitely a strong one. ""No," my lovely wife said, passing the glass to me. Full-bodied, left a film in the mouth, but nothing a sip of water can't cure. Tasty, but not something you'd spend your whole night drinking."
"Definitely a warming beer, and would pair well with a nice cheese or a scoop of vanilla ice cream. The alcoholic power of this beer, however would suggest that even half of this twelve ounce bottle would be sufficient. I would buy it again, just to store for a special occasion."
"O - I am not a fan of this. I bought four bottles and I'm hoping it cools down after a few years."
"I like it. Definitely an easy drinking sipper. Gotta be careful with this one."
"No question a heavy-hitting Barleywine that is best shared. Although the alcohol character is over the top, the aromas and flavors have some real pleasant, dynamic qualities."
"O: A good beer. Dark, heavy, and sweet. I like it, but it's a tad too sweet for me. I'll probably have another, but it'll be a while. Pretty drinkable considering it's 16%; the alcohol is present, but not overwhelming. Tentative recommendation."
"Notes: ""Samael is the prince of demons, the angel of death, accuser and destroyer. Filled with enmity towards man, he planted the vine, the forbidden tree of paradise. Behold his venom and vengeance, both sweet and tempting, enticing you, his spellbound victim, within his wings."""
"Glad I tried this, but I don't think I'll try it again for awhile"
"The alcohol isn't really overpowering and its pretty thick and smooth but this is definitely a slow sipper."
"O: A Monster. An honor being able to venture this one."
"-GFunk"
"O- Really like this brew. Very close to a 4.5 on the taste and overall. If you haven't tried this one, check it out- it will warm your insides."
"mouthfeel - a little too syrupy, but its not cough medicine syrupy, so thats good, more like a cherry syrup, good carbonation"
"O - Alcohol is hidden pretty well for a beer with such a high ABV. Fairly sweet. I think it could be balanced a bit better. If you can get your hands on one put it in the cellar. I think it will mellow out nicely."
"Overall: A very tasty and well balanced brew. Very drinkable and smooth with that high of a abv."
"(12oz bottle from Total Wine Desert Ridge. Batch 3, bottled April 2007). Pours cloudy brown, almost like melted caramel, with a minimal tan head. Carbonation is light with some floaties. Aroma has caramel, oak and dried pit fruit. Taste is sweeet, with more oak, caramel and vanilla. Full bodied with a sticky texture. Finish is smooth and a bit boozy. This is a nice, flavorful sipper that woud be great in the winter months."
"Overall not my favorite Barleywine, a little too much sweetness and then overpowering alcohol. If I had to do over I would age this and let it settle down some. May buy a bottle or two for the cellar."
"Final thought - $8 and 15+ ABV. This is a beer for the ages. Wow."
"O- I am not really sure what to think of this. I'd really like this beer much more if aged, as it's just too hot for me. Man, it smells awesome though!"
"Still drinkable for the strongest ABV beer I've had. Definitely one to try if you're adventurous with your beers. I'm glad I tried it, but I can't imagine picking it up again - a bit too much alcohol and associated sweetness in there."
"O. This was a very slow drinker for me but well worth the price. For such a high ABV it is very drinkable and i will be picking up a few more to cellar."
"Overall this was a decent beer which had a considerable amount of age on it. The aroma was without question it's strong point."
"O: All in all, this is a good brew. Definitely hot, but what do you expect from the ABV percentage. Hard to brew beers this big without evident alcohol. Very few breweries have managed to do it. Give it a dry if you like big boozy brews."
"Overall, this is a good brew, and I definitely see myself having it again and recommending it to friends."
"Narrative: “PLEASE STACY, that is my grandmother’s Faberge egg collection you just NO! NO!” Anthony could only watch in horror as his girlfriend gorged herself on whiskey and plums, destroying their possession with careless abandon. “OK NO, now you are taking things too far, do not push my Body By Jake off of the balcon- NO!” Things weren’t going so well for the couple, she drank more, ate more dark fruits, and broke his things as a byproduct. What was Anthony to do? The sex was amazing and she was his special Persephone, delving each night to savor the succor of sour mash and destruction. “Please, I have all of my FINAL FANTASY SAVE GAMES ON THOSE! HOURS OF! NO!” Somehow, it all evened out, she was sweet while sober and a complete monster when unleashed, but he liked it that way, secretly. “EARTHBOUND IN THE ORIGINAL BOX! NOOO!”"
"I'll preface this by saying I'm not the biggest barleywine fan, English or otherwise. However, I ordered a snifter of this at the Long Room in Chicago and enjoyed the heck of out it. The oak is pronounced and helps smooth out the sweet, caramel smells and flavors. Lots of quirks and subtleties, and a slow sipper for sure. Not all of the alcohol is hidden, (and how could it be?) but the slight burn is a plus, not a detraction. Very glad I had one of these, I can't remember the last time I enjoyed an Avery offering so much!"
"Pours a nice amber-garnet color with a very thin tan head and no retention or lacing. The nose brings forward a lot of sweet malt plus some caramel and brown sugar. A bit of dark fruit and a lot of booze there as well. The flavor brings forward much of the same, though it's not as integrated, likely due to the fact that the alcohol is really taking over. Plus, there's a bit too much sweetness. Both of these characteristics pervade throughout the feel and finish. Pretty good, but needed more time or it needs to be toned down a bit."
"Again, very drinkable for being such a big beer. Glad I picked up 2 bottles, can't wait to have the other one in a few months or so. It's so flavorful at 4 years old, a new bottle would probably be too much for me. I imagine the aging helped this out."
"Medium to thick mouthfeel and low carbonation."
"Had this one on tap at the Rackhouse in Denver. Poured a translucent amber color, with a bit of thin whitish head. Aromas of booze, oak, alcohol, figs, liquor and assorted dark fruits. Nice oaky flavors, along with brown sugar, sweet malt, caramel and lots of alcohol."
"Overall: A must try!!"
"I love this beer. I imagine it could stand up to at least another year or two before being poured, but for being 4 years old I was amazed how gracefully it's mellowed and developed secondary flavors. Sit on the newest batch for a few years and you'll be rewarded as much as I was."
"Taste is strong, bad fermented toffee with a hint of woody whisky quality. It is soon evident that it is sickly sweet yet with a hot, strong alcoholic boozy character, rough, sharp, one-dimensional, and unpleasant. This has a couple traits that are really intense, without anything else, and goes for sheer strength over any semblance of quality, complexity, or the like. I know the ABV is high, but I've had several that are very close to this and are far smoother, less obviously boozy, and have complexixty and character, rather than simply hot, sweet, rough alcohol. It is a total dud."
"Pours a slightly murky copper with a very short head that settles to a thin ring. I'm not overly concerned about this given that the bottle I'm drinking is two years old and that the abv is so high. Smells extremely sweet, like malt candy. I don't mind some sweetness, but this is ridiculous! The taste is also quite sweet, but there is, fortunately, some zingy citrus and apple as well a bit of spice, and some creamy custard . Really, the taste is quite nice if you can deal with a sweeter beer. The mouthfeel is silky, and after two years in the bottle, the only heat I felt was from the first sip I had after the pour. After it opens and warms it is actually quite mellow and drinkable. Also, I'm pleased to note that no sherry notes have crept in. After cellaring for years, I've come to dislike that particular flavor and had thought of giving it up- except that with the right beer, like this one and innumerable sours the result is quite pleasant."
"O: Not bad for a what I would classify as a strong ale. The sweetness of it is just a bit too much for me. Other than that a good strong ale."
"Overall: It's alright, and I'm glad I got to try it, but it's not something I'll likely be seeking out again. The sweetness is a bit much and I'll be challenged to finish the bottle on my own. This is definitely one to share."
"O: This beer is just fabulous. I'm sure the fresh version is hot as hell. If that's your thing- great. Me - yeah I'm sipping a 5 year old vintage. That's a little smoother."
"MF- Big and creamy. This is a very rich and flavorful beer that's only big downfall is how out of balance it is with the sweetness, but on the other hand, with this big of an ABV, it's almost understandable...Almost."
"This beer will definitely sneak up on you. I would say on an Avery scale it is oddly the drinkability is very low. This is a beer that looks much better then it tastes and smells. Samael's can use additional IBUs to balance the malty sweetness even for the style."
"D: delicious but the heat makes it an unlikely candidate for the daily drinker"
"SkÅL!"
" I am on the fence with Samael: I love it, but it is SO cloying. Hard to finish, but still enjoyable. In the old drinkability, it would be a ""2.5"". In the new overall, it is a 3.5 because it really is a good beer but the sweetness hurts it significantly."
"Overall: As noted, this is good to sample and discuss. As a novelty craft beer (to me at least), it's quite an item and stands out as an extreme of the style. 6.5 of 10 in my book."
"glassware: tulip"
"D - So drinkable for ~15%. I can down it easily and I just love to drink it. Have yet to find an Avery beer that's not wonderful. At 4 years old this beer is amazing."
"Batch 3 from April 2007."
"D: Definite sipper because of booziness but has more drinkability than most 15%+ beers."
"Pineapple, apricot, peach. Above average mouthfeel. Pretty drinkable for such high alcohol. Bottle at Beerbistro with Todd B."
"Mouthfeel is heavy and syrupy, coats the palate, samael is certainly a sipping beer, the sweetness is great and keeps from becoming cloying. Great find and I'll be looking for more of it in the future."
"D - A very flavorful and robust beer. I love it. One will be last me through at least the hour."
"Back in the day, this beer kicked my sorry ass. Let's see how things have progressed, eh? It pours a hazy russet-amber topped by a half-finger of off-white foam. The nose comprises buttery toffee, vanilla, oak, caramel, and a small touch of booze in the back, though that remains decidedly demure. The taste holds notes of harshly sweet toffee, light whiskey, caramel, and maple syrup. The sweetness is a bit annoying, but at least it's not o'erwhelming. The body is lightly hefty, with a very light moderate carbonation and a syrupy feel. Overall, a pretty decent b-wine, but too sweet for my liking. Other than that, though, not too bad."
"This beer pours a tawny amber color with an ecru foam covering the surface. The beer needs to be allowed to warm up before enjoying due to the fact that it's repugnant until at correct temperatures. The smell is strongly of figs, plums, butterscotch and rum. There is really no alcohol aroma behind the beer, but that doesn't mean that this beer isn't strong. The taste of this beer greatly follows the nose in almost every way except there is a residual vanilla taste that comes from the oak. The mouthfeel is sticky and cloying along with the buttery mouthfeel I could honestly do without. This beer I sipped and still got buzzed, so it's drinkability is highly questionable. A good beer overall, but for the love of God, let the thing warm up!"
"Murky opaque mahagony brown color. Thick syrupy appearance at pour and swirl. 1/2"" light tan head at pour settles to dense, frothy-like bubbled ring at edge of glass with some covering to the face. Decent lacing on the glass. Very rich aroma. Heavy caramel smell to aroma, along with some undecided dark fruit notes and even some aromatics reminiscent of smoked pete. THe oak smell of this very much like a lagvulin J.W. Lees. No hops present in this one. Maybe even some small hints of chocolate malt to this. Overall an aroma leaning towards some dark nutty, earthy notes. Very thick, syrupy mouthfeel. Sits very heavy. Low carbonation. Rich in flavor as well, packed with caramel, pete notes, dark fruit, some chocolate. Finish with warmth leans towards the alcohol content, slightly medicinal. Aftertaste brings more of the pete and nutty flavor with a big caramel and alcohol kick. Definitely one to sip on. A very complex and tasty drink to say the absolute least."
"Overall, this aged exceptionally well and i am hard pressed to think of an american brewer with a better barleywine given proper cellaring. I would say that this will continue to improve and I will sit on my remaining ones for a few more years."
"Not recommended to drink with spicy foods because this beer is hot. Great beer for sipping and when it is cold out. This would probably be most enjoyed around the campfire in early spring/late fall. Glad I have 3 left to enjoy."
"O: This beer is a little to sweet for me but it is complex and a big time beer. Interesting offering from Avery."
"D- Dude, not a session beer."
"this is not a very drinkable beer not cause of the taste but because of the amount of alcohol."
"D - Nice warming barleywine, but the burn from the booze slows down drinking."
"D - this is a sipping beer and one that would probably benefit from more aging."
"D-Although the alcohol is incredibly high, that's not what brings down the drinkability here, it's actually the sweetness that makes it difficult to do anything but sip."
"creamy, medium-full bodied mouth feel with just the right carbonation level; dangerously drinkable for a brew this potent."
"D - This is a sipper and it's great. It has a little stronger alcohol taste than I expected considering it's been bottled over three and a half years ago. I really enjoy it. It's amazing to see what some time can do to beers."
"A very interesting, intense beer. It's a bit of a struggle to finish though."
"This is a hard beer to drink...it has some interesting flavors in it, but there is something stale tasting in the finish. It is such a strong ale, perhaps it is the dried fruit flavors, but while this is a very complex beer, it may be a little to much."
"drinkability - while i loved the flavor - i needed almost 2 hours to drink the entire 12oz bottle - man vs booze"
"D: I like it. Very smooth and complex. Glad I split this three ways, and for the price I won't be buying this very often (or again), but I thoroughly enjoyed the time this beer and I had together."
"This is an absolutely terrific American attempt at an English Barleywine. It looks nice in the glass, it smells wonderful, and is just a well crafted, big beer. However, this drinks every bit its advertised 16,4% and will take quite some time to get through 12 ounces."
"Taste is sweet, boozy, sharp and a bit harsh. There's oak and sweet candy and lots of tasty dark fruits. Mouthfeel is light and crisp it's a bit sweet but well balanced."
"M/D: So, so drinkable despite the high abv. A tad syrupy on the mouth. Coats the tongue on every swig. The alcohol burn isn't as bad as I thought it'd be. A great, unique beer. Expensive, but worth it."
"Has a creamy, heavy, hot and deliriously satisfying mouth-feel, much like being in a sauna with a couple of horny buxom female prize fighters who want to spar with your beer-gut fat-ass a bit. You're gonna take a few hits with this one, but it's all gonna be worth it in the end. All I can say is approach with caution, take your licks, but don't forget to enjoy the ride."
"Overall impression: A dangerous beer, one that makes me briefly contemplate tackling 2 16% beers in one session. This one does not deserve to fly under the radar."
"This beer is huge, but extremely drinkable for its strength. A 12oz bottle is perfect."
"Drinkability- 3.5 out of 5. My god, this beer is good. For a beer about which I had heard a lot of stories about not being able to finish it, I am immensely pleased. It went down so easily that I could definitely drink another; however, its drinkability takes a hit from the prohibitive price. Another hit comes from the fact that it's so strong-- two would be enough for almost any beer lover. Anyone trying to get shitfaced should probably just look for a cheaper, more chuggable brew instead of this pedestal-worthy rarity."
"D: Speechless. Couldn't get through a 6oz serving ... love of god."
"I was definitely expecting this to taste a little like The Beast, but I was very pleased to find out that they are two different drinks. My one complain is the sugar level. It makes the glass too sticky, but does not effect the flavor much. I was anticipating a little more happening in this beer, but it seems like it's going to be impossible to do so. Fortunately the made this big boy different enough that I'm not in a rush to write this off as another juggernaut beer. It possesses a lot of things you've had before but just enough to make it that much different, and at such an alcohol %. I imagine aging this one won't help at this point."
"A beast of a brew. Great ollld oak flavors with hard liquor qualities, then a huge caramelly rush with a bit of candied sugar. This is my 3rd time having a 2-3 yr old vintage and the older it gets the better it seems to get so far. I highly recommend it."
"D - not terrible for a 16.5% beer, but let's be honest, the sickly-sweet character plus the alky combine for something I can't even finish one of."
"Avery have done a fantastic job on this beer but it's definitely a sipping beer. I wouldn't want to tackle a bottle of it on my own at one sitting, not without company to share it with."
"D: A fine, well made English barleywine. Don't know how many of these I could drink in one sitting, but still a good brew."
"D: Sippable, I am wishing I split this 12 oz with my wife instead of each of us taking one."
"To put it simply, this beer is exactly what it's supposed to be. I was skeptical of these $10~ 12oz bottles despite my uniformly good experiences with Avery's beer, but I'm a believer now. This is a beer you buy, hold on to, then enjoy thoroughly when it's time for a big, hot sipper with endless flavor."
"D- None, whatsoever. Just couldn't dig this one, and I am an Avery fan. Sorry."
"D= Hmm. This beer isn't what I would call drinkable but it's not like I wouldn't if I didn't get so tore up. A great tasting beer that would go really well with a meal that could hold up to it."
"d: Yeah its hot, sweet, and franky kind of obnoxious (not to mention expensive). I like it though, a hell of a lot more than I expected to."
"This one probably fits better as an English Strong Ale, but who am I to disagree? I've traveled the world and the seven seas, everybody is lookin for something."
"Active pour gets you close to three fingers of light tan foam, mostly medium-sized bubbles so there's retention in a steady dissolving fashion, the lacing is incredibly thick, more a sheer wall than streaks. Dense cloudiness to the reddish brown mud coloration, you might have to want to find a more orange to yellow hue around the rims, close to nada bubbles visible. The nose makes you think Willy Wonka is in the house, vanilla fudge, caramel, milk chocolate, butterscotch, coconut, licorice, nuts, the pear, peach, yellow apple, cherry scents close to dried fruit in nature, somehow manages to develop and erect posture in the complete absence of hops or anything which might keep its knuckles off the ground. Full-bodied, the carbonation is close to zip, this said, it does have more fluidity than expected and is just shifty enough that you can ignore how boozy or hot it is. Sweet plum, cherry, apricot, pear fruit, when paired with all that vanilla, caramel, butterscotch it kinda becomes hard to take it seriously as a ""nuanced"" beer. Kind of defies you to find a hoppy spine. Homogeneous enough that you have to say, if you have a cigar and the time to smoke it, do so 'cause it may be your last chance. Still, you cannot deny how it massages your primary pleasure nodes."
"D- Hard to drink, a big disappointment after Mephistopheles. Alcohol is hidden, not as complex as I was hoping."
"This monster hides its booze well, but it's there. Fantastic offering in the style, not to be missed for EBW fans, but definitely a one-and-done. This is something to be enjoyed slowly over the course of a couple hours, not in gulps."
"Diabetes and caries inducing but quite drinkable."
"Notes: Super complex, but dense, fat and slick. This beer is all about hedonism and lusciousness. The booze is present but not aggressively prickly. It's more slick than hot. Not for the faint of palate, this beer will wreck you! FFO Stone Double Bastard, North Coast Old Stock Ale, J.W. Lee's Harvest Ales. Big, sweet, delicious. Just like me..."
"D - Definitely an after-dinner drink for sipping. Probably best shared with a friend, wouldn't want to drink more than one in a sitting."
"D - Well this isn't exactly a beer that you can really drink more than one in a sitting but it does have a very good taste thats worth picking up sometime to try"
"D - I find myself enjoying each sip a little more than the last, only concern is the high ABV. This is a great once in while beer."
"Feel is slick, oily, feels as though it coats the entire palate. Truly a dominating brew. Surely not for the weak and undedicated. You need to be a man to finish one of these."
"D: Can't drink too much of this in one sitting, but I will be getting it again. Though next time I hope they give out some complimentary insulin."
"Drinkability - Very good beer. I love the complexity of it. As far as being able to come back for another one or two, I couldn't say I could do it. One a night would be my limit for this beer."
"I would buy this beer again, but wouldn't mind sharing with someone either."
"I am going back to have another."
"Notes-I think I'm going to pick up another bottle and horde it away for a few years and re-review this; this beer really scream out to be aged."
"What an amazing little sipper this one turned out to be."
"D - For a 16.45% ABV beer, this is remarkably drinkable. The first barleywine that I have truly enjoyed. Perhaps it is because it has already aged 2 years. This beer has opened my mind up tp barleyines, which I had previously decided weren't' fro me."
"Batch 5, aged a year (opening in May 2010 after buying may 2009.) and shared with a friend. Pours a light Amber with little or no lacing. Smell is one of fermented or rotting fruit, particularly raisin or prune, or apricot. All sweetness, but varying degrees of sourness creep in. Tastes like a fine bourbon thats toned down quite a bit. The ABV is well hidden in the drink, feels more like an 11 or 12% abv beer. Overall a good beer to share with someone, as a full bottle could prove a daunting task. I'd try it again, especially if a different batch was made available to me."
"Batch 4, bottled April 2008. In a snifter it was a pretty cherry amber color with a small tan head. Very sweet aroma, caramel and fruit. Fairly hot alcohol aroma. Sweet, sweet taste. Caramel, a bit of fruit, some late hops. Alcohol still pretty noticeable. Syrupy mothfeel. A barleywine on steroids."
"D: I love this stuff, so have no difficulty putting it away. Reminds me of Alpine Great, Big Sky Old Bluehair, and J.W. Lees."
"D- The aging has done awesome things for this beer; it's simply awesome!"
"Now that this thing has sat for 3 yrs... It's still god damn undrinkable. And there's shit floating everywhere. Good carbonation otherwise, a little lively. Smells like I'm gonna have a terrible morning. UNHOLY BOOZE!! Tastes like fermented prune juice, or a Dr. pepper & Old Grand Dad. Way to drinkable! Fuck them and their 14.9% ABV, I'm going to bed."
"As far a barley wine goes there are ones that are far better. this is a fun one to drink, instant buzz in a bottle."
"Samael's Ale is definitely a sipper based on its richness and its hefty ABV. In fact, it was a little bit like drinking some kind of liqueur. I enjoyed my first experience with Samael's ale and I would love to cellar a bottle for a few years."
"Pours like a heavy dark void that was impenetrable by light; it was topped with a thick brown and bubbly head and that didn't waste its time disappearing. Little carbonation. There were strong sweet aromas ranging from tootsie rolls to vanilla to melted brown sugar all covered by a slight undertone of alcohol. It's well enveloped by alcohol with a strong sweet with hints of almond, vanilla, brer rabbit molasses, caramel, and dark fruit. Oh yes and malts flavors too! This is a full bodied ale that really knocks your taste buds around; this ale does have some smooth qualities in its drinkability but is a real in your face ale overall. This was a rather difficult beer for me to drink, but well worth the experience."
"Well, this one's been in the cellar for a few years. A re foil wrapped 12 ounce'er. Bottled in 2005, label states - 14.5% ABV. Uncapped and poured into my tulip glass. Samael's appears a clear, crimson brown color with barely any foam to mention. Nose and flavors consist of dark toasted wheat bread, brown sugar, plums, raisins, sweet, sweet caramelized malt, very mild cider vinegar notes, candied cherries soaked in booze. Medium to full bodied for the style and somewhat syrupy with decent carbonation. Alcohol heat was not as noticeable as I thought it would be. This has mellowed quite nicely actually. Nice drinkability, one sip at a time."
"Just had the 2010 release and it was as fantastic as it always is. Pours a great dark copper color with a fizzy white head that quickly dissapates. On the nose I mainly got notes of Vanilla and maple syrup. The palate was sweet and malty with flaovrs of vanilla extract, nuts, and banana. The high BAV really starts to show through in the finish, sort of drinks like a good cognac, goes down smooth with a slight burn at the end."
"Drinkability is pretty good. I was surprised how easy this went down for me as I thought it would be pretty intense with a 16.45% abv. There is a bit of burning as it goes down but nothing to really turn me off. It seems to be one the sweet side but still a pretty good example of and English style barleywine. I would enjoy having another, but this is best as a once in a while beer for me."
"D: A delicious strong ale. I like revisiting beers I've had before my BA days. It's a good compass to compare where I've come in 4 years. The beer reminds me of a young JW Lee's in some ways. It's still a bit boozy, but at 16.5% and a year old, I can't say I blame it. Great now, but a beer I want to put in a vault until 2025 and see where it goes."
"Big beer, big alcohol, not all that good though."
"Overall, I bought this beer without reading the label and without knowing anything about it. I was surprised at how big it is. I've had lots of big beers and this seems to be one of those that ""brags"" about it's bigness. The booze becomes too much of a focal point and the malt sweetness is a bit over the top. This isn't necessarily a bad beer just isn't the best of its kind."
"If this brew were a bit more balanced it could be truly amazing. Still, a good craft ale experience."
"A devil of a beer that lives up to it's name."
"This beer has a level of complexity one expects with a cognac. It pours deep brownish orange with a thin white head. It has an incredibly strong smell of honey. Taste is amazingly complicated, with hints of cherry, chocolate, licorice, cinnamon, vanilla, and plumbs. This beer does nothing to hide it alcohol and why should it, at a whopping 33 proof it should say it loud and proud. It goes down quite smooth though. Drinkability is good, but at the strength this beer is I wouldn't recommend too many in one sitting."
"drinkability: wouldnt recommend this one to any lighter beer fans or beer newbs. i cant really envision a type of session that would involve one of these but it was worth a try."
"Notes: Here Avery does a great job at matching the extreme and provocative theme of these demons of ale. Makes me wonder how they can make this impressive ale next to a trite offering like Hog Heaven... Anyhow, I take the good with the ugly and keep on remebering them for these offerings."
"The color on this beauty is a very dark root beer brown, cloudy and murky with a fair oatmeal colored head and very good lacing. The aroma says deep licorice malt and nutty brown bread with lots of red wine/bourbon on top. Very full and robust, very nice. The flavor offers a blast to the mouth full of tawny port and nutty malt. Wow. Very sweet and thick but somehow, long as you keep a slow pace, it settles in with a really delicious red wine scoth ale combo deal. It's pretty much a full bodied brew with a bit of a resinous feel and an appropriately fine carbonation. This is no session beer but it is a great taste experience to savor. Nice stuff!"
"This beer is nobody's session beer, but it is highly drinkable."
"Overall, if you want to warm up quickly and get drunk within minutes...this beer is perfect. However, the alcohol really wasn't the problem here. Just way too sweet. Plain and simple."
"good beer."
"This was a nice surprise. I expected a gimmicky ""look how strong our beer is"" kind of beer that was probably going to be a hot boozy mess. It was actually really quite good and something I would drink again. I think the 5 years of aging probably helped this out a lot."
"I'm really diggin this beer. I feel very lucky to have stumbled upon an entire sixer of this. Unfortunately i've never had this beer fresh so I can only speculate on the changes that have occured. I don't believe this is available in Pittsburgh anymore but I'm going to keep an eye out for a fresh bottle. Barleywines aren't my favorite, but if this is the norm for aged BW's then I will certainly be grabbing some more btls from time to time for cellaring purposes."
"D- Difficult to get down, especially with the high ABV. I split the first bottle I had 4 ways and wound up finishing all 4 glasses myself."
"D - The alcohol is amazingly hidden, but the sweetness makes this 12 oz bottle a perfect dessert beer for a dinner party of 4, I'd say."
"Pours a clear, dark amber color. 1/2 inch head of a white color. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of alcohol, slight sweet malt, oak/liquor, and slight hops. Fits the style of an English Barleywine. Mouth feel is smooth and crisp with an average carbonation level. Tastes of alcohol, sweet malt, dark citrus, oak/liquor, and slight hops. Overall, the alcohol clearly dominates, but still glad I tried."
"Overall Impression: Everything I expected some such a beast."
"Not very drinkable, unless you have a companion to split the bottle. Mine is very adament that my review is a little rough, but it is my opinion."
"I am really disappointed (and hate) to have to rate this beer so poorly as I can appreciate how difficult such an intensive beer could be to create. I have tried some other ""brews"" which I would put into this same category (Barley John's Anne's Old Ale - 17% ABV, Samuel Adam's Utopias - 27% ABV) and granted they are much more expensive, they deserve the price tag and the recognition. When the ABV gets so high, balance is critical and Samael's Ale is not there and is very poorly done. Even with other reviewers suggestion of ""mellowing"" or even microwaving, I don't think this beer will ever be worth the cumulative BA rating it is getting."
"oooohhh baby. this be one fine assed beer. mmm hmm. yessir. Pour was nothing special with just a so-so smallish off white head. Color is a lovely, rich, clear medium amber. Aroma is surprisingly mildly malty and hoppy. Flavor is where this sweet little dog knocks my socks off. Boom! Wild combination of characteristics: really hoppy, really malty sweet, lots of oak, and some spicy hot something or other. Body is luscious and carbonation in tune. Finish is sultry and leaves me with a come-on for another decadent sip. Have I sold my soul? who cares. good beer though. Can't hardly be a session."
"D-Stay away if you don't like boozy beers. This one's a sipper but none the less pretty good. Especially as a night cap. Is it possible a Cognac was born and nobody bother to tell it it was actually a beer?"
" D- This beer has a delicious malt sweetness with some nice support from alcohol and oak that turns a bit to boozy as it is pretty warm. This beer is big and rich which is a great sipper to take the chill of winter."
"D: Needed to recap this beer after sharing half of it."
"T/M - Thick, malty sweet and intense. Wow. Very complex with port like characteristics...dried fruit and slight licorice flavors are most noticeable. Very nice alcohol warming effect. This beer needs to be sipped and chewed."
"I suppose this is pretty much just an alcohol heavy oaked barleywine. If you're not into huge boozy beers than stay away from this one at all costs."
"Drinkability: Its not really that drinkable. Its not really meant to be. Its OK as a sipper, and its a fun thing to try. I would never buy it again, but I will buy their next experiment."
"I wound up microwaving the rest of the bottle for 1 min @ 1200W. The ethanol receded substantially, and the beer became halfway drinkable, with strong honey, cherries, orange rind, and oak. It's not something for which I can justifiably bump up the score, but it's a suggestion: microwave it instead of drainpouring it."
"But I think both are very good. Just one left to try- Mephistopheles."
"D - this one is tasty as all hell, but way to sweet and rich to actually enjoy more than 12 oz. in a sitting. interesting to see how this one mellows out over time. can't wait to try it again in a year or 3."
"D) Last time I had one of these, I woke up sprawled on the couch with a third of a glass left. Way smoother this time around, definitely delicious, and if my body was capable of pounding back a few, I'd do it."
"(D)- Not a big fan of this one. It just might be showing its age, or it just needs half a decade to balance out, I cant decide. Either way, this is one robust, thick, and really sweet barleywine that warms you up with a sweet alchoholic feel, while at the same time absolutely kicking you to the floor withough apologizing. Despite my poor rating, I really want to see what additional aging would do to one of these."
"Very sweet. I'd try this again, but only as a share. desert beer."
"D: the combination of the very sweet taste and high alcohol content make it difficult to drink more than one. I'm having a hard enough time just finishing this bottle."
"Overall this was a very impressive big ABV beer and the bold flavors do their job in covering up the alcohol. Certainly worth a shot."
"I need to re visit this batch soon."
"Pours a clear bright orange, some neat tangerine highlights, thick off white head forms, pretty admirable for a brew of this strength, lace chunks stick to the side of the glass as it settles to a thin ring. Smell is intense, big alcohol, very woody, citrus, vanilla, a bit harsh, fruit, raisins, toffee, brown sugar, very rough and intense. Taste is similar, but nice, big alcohol and toffee, rich, vanilla, oak, sweet and sugary, butterscotch, toasted wood, sherry, a bit rough. Mouthfeel is full bodied, syrupy with low carbonation, some big warmth going down. A little rough going down, but I was surprised I enjoyed this one, a sipper for sure and wouldn't want more than 5 oz."
"Drinkability: The ABV in this one is high, and not easily overcome. It's a good beer, but will be difficult to make it through the bottle."
"D - not too drinkable, because it's a strong one. But very delicious at the same time. About what you'd expect for such high ABV. Sweet and boozy. Reminds of carbonated sherry."
"It has a deep red/brown body with a little cabonation. The head and lace are both very thick and off-white. This beer has a aged wood and candy like aroma. It has some very heavy fruit esters with a little bit of hops to it. The mouthfeel is buttery, full and has some alcohol presents. A lot warmth to it. There is a very rich and sweet aftertaste."
"Drinkability: To call this one a slow sipper is a bit of an understatement. While I'd tout other beers for their keen drinkability, here I'd give myself a pat on the back for the ability to drink and endure the entire twelve ounces. Also, it may or may not have been the initial jaw-seizing grimace, but, either way, all this sweetness has caused one of my teeth to hurt. =("
"Drinkability: What drinkability? There is none. This is a slow sipper that will kick you in the pants from beginning to end. I love how the oak elements really pop out of this after tasting it, it almost makes the aroma deceiving, since I got alot of cherries & chocolate in here. Overall these Avery beers are standout brews, although I liked the Grand Cru & Mephistopheles a bit better, this is one of the better barleywines I've had in quite some time. Take caution with this one, it's smooth and not too hard to drink but this one will catch up to you quickly. Highly Recommended!"
"D. A sipper. A big beer for sure. One I wouldn't mind having again. This beer is one to be enjoyed in front of a fire on a winter's night."
"Nothing like a good oak-aged barleywine. This one pours a nice medium brown / amber color with a medium head and a strong smell. Warming alcohol burn from beginning to end but worth it all the while. This one was Batch 4 (April 2008) with an ABV sitting at 15.53%. Drank from a snifter slightly cold (my mistake) but would probably have been even better just at cellar temperature. I really wish we could get Avery here because they make some of the best beers around. Samael's I would have to say though is near the top of the list along with The Beast and Maharaja. May not be something you can drink all night but I wouldn't mind being the one to try. Will have to make sure to grab a few of these the next chance I get. A+"
"This is a tasty brew for certain, but I am not putting down more than one because of both the high abv, and also the aggressive palate. If you enjoy an antagonistic, high gravity beer, this is a must try."
"The beer pours a dark amber color with a thick frothy offwhite head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is great! It has a wonderful burnt toffee aroma along with a kick ass wood aged scent. It lends a nice vanilla character to the beer. The taste is good as well. It has a wicked oak flavor that wraps itself up with the caramel notes and burnt toffee flavors. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a damn fine beer. It's a sipper for sure, but damn is it tastey."
"this beer pours a crystal clear color with an off white head. the aroma speaks largely of the caramel malts, and dried fruit, maybe a bit of raisin in there, but the oak mellows it all out with the vanilla and earthiness. the taste follows with the fruity esters up front with a lot of sweet roasted malt, little in the way of hops to speak of. the full body is nice but for a beer of this maginitude I could use a bit less co2. a nice barley wine none the less"
"The smell off the bottle was oaky and maybe a bit brandy. I poured it into a pint glass and had it sit for 10 minutes. Wow. Definitely can smell a strong slighty burnt oak aroma. Poured a dark golden color. No head and slight bubbles. First taste is strong but not overly strong with a slight roasted flavor and an alcohol back end. Good mouthfeel as it doesn't overwhelm it as I expected it being 16.45%. Drinkability is a strong ale with a strong alcohol back end. Would be a good winter beer on a cold day or night. This is a take your time and drink beer. Drinking off a pint glass, I'm getting the smell and taste of this and it's a grabber. Back end taste a little like candy? Overall, a good beer that I'm glad I finally tried."
"Pretty close for an English barleywine. Mostly. Other than the medicinal bit (and the burps - whoa!)."
"This is definitely a sipper as it shows the alcohol (and the wood character) very prominently. It's very sweet as well and overall has a pretty limited drinkability."
"A sipper but also good with dessert. Drink with care. The alcohol really creeps up on you!"
"The mouthfeel is a bit syrupy but relatively good for the high alcohol. The alcohol is present but enjoyable."
"Very sweet tasting with berry-like fruitiness and a wintergreen mint/menthol alcohol flavor. Oak is there, but is somewhat covered up by an almost distractingly syrupy sweetness. There are a few other flavors in there...cola, touch of smoke and roasted malt. Mouthfeel is thick and virtually has no carbonation. Very much drinks like a port, certainly a sipper. I think I like this better than The Beast."
"D- Simply put, I am pretty blown away by this beer. It is definitely a sipper, but it is dangerously drinkable for a beer of it's strength. Overall, I would definitely recommend trying this beer. This bottle was only a few months old. I can't imagine what a few years would do to this beer! Time to go stock up on a few bottles of this for aging purposes."
"Very good furry mouthfeel but the alcohol certainly affects the drinkability."
"Overall: Great brew again from Avery, a tad on the sweet side but a nice delight. Only thing I would change would a be a little bit more hop and oak character."
"smells sweet, some fruits. noticed a strong cherry armoma, which goes well with the ruby color. smells oaky, somewhat like whiskey, a bit of other fruits and citrus that was juiced over burning oak ashes. tastes great, very sweet and fruity. also tastes like buttered biscuits, sweet and yeasty. very silky and tastes great"
"Still some carbonation in the mouthfeel. Absolutely delicious. Glad I have a few more bottles. This one can still go for some more time."
"Malty and hot throughout, little hoppiness, caramel sweetness and little carbonation. A strong, powerful beer, I can have one glass enjoyably."
"This is for sure a sipper, but a pretty darn good one for the style, Its a strong ale and it is made to enjoy slowly."
"Overall, worth a try, but not worth $9 a bottle."
"Warm! The high ABV come through in the mouthfeel. As soon as it hits the tongue Sam warms every surface it touches. But a creamy coconut milk and vanilla softness soothes just as fast. All I can say is wow. This is a truly outstanding beer and a definite sipper. The warmer it gets the more distinct the flavors and the richer the experience. Well worth the $8 and the brain cells it kills. I can't wait to age some."
"D - In a field where most other competitors are half the alcoholic strength, this beer is tough to come to grips with when style is concerned. For what it is, Samael's is a very tasty and downright sugar-raped adult liquid candy of a beer. It has some complexities like a well developed sherry might, but in the end the crazy sweetness trumps pretty much every other aspect."
"taste is strong, smooth, a little sweet, prune, burnt caramel, toasted nuts, some sour malt, cedar, a little sweet cherry juice, and licorice, ends dry and a little bitter."
"Fairly light color for the boldness in taste. The head was more than I expected for a beer this strong too. I didn't really like the smell; I'm thinking it must be the oak barrel smell and I just finished an IPA which usually smell wonderful to me. The taste is delicious. Definitely on the sweet side. Not as much of an alcohol flavor for such a high ABV as I expected, but it does finish with a nice warm feeling. Cherry and caramel highlight the flavor. This is a royal beer with a smooth finish, nice aftertaste and fairly drinkable for such a strong beer. Reminds me a bit of Samiclaus but with more of an oak flavor."
"Drinkability: its going down well for 14.5% ABV but no beer of this strength is very drinkabile IMHO. Sip one bottle over a couple of hours and call it a night."
"I still don't know how I feel about this beer. Very complex with many flavors but yet extremely high ABV. Very good sipping beer, but the flavor wants me to drink it quicker than just sipping.???"
"I love that Avery is doing this experimental barrel aged series. I think this one and Brabant (the other one I've had) would benefit from some aging for sure. I will keep buying these and apreciate the fact that Avery is on the cutting edge."
"Full, sticky mouthfeel. A bit light on the carbonation and ends up a little syrupy. But damn if I didn't enjoy that snifter."
"Another solid ""experimental"" brew from Avery."
"Samael is the Angel of Death and resides in Seventh Heaven. Avery Samael's Ale makes me glad to be alive and is a truly heavenly brew. Never mind the $7.99 price tag for 12 ounces (4 years ago), this is exceptional beer that I will now add to my cellar whenever the opportunity presents itself. Bottom line: devilishly good."
"D: It will take me all night to get through this beer - it must be consumed slowly, and would make a great nightcap!"
"Notes - I wouldn't want more than one of these in a sitting."
"Drinkability is like the mouthfeel. There is too much booze and alcohol to make this very drinkable. It's just kind of messy and needs more focus. I personally would like more malty sweetness to balance out the big booze flavors."
"with the oak/ woody finish - one sip away from empty i feel like i'm hittin' the hard stuff - coats the mouth thoroughly, syrupy, not in a bad way - this has warmed my stomach, and my brain - i enjoyed this bottle tonight."
"Picked up a bottle of this in Oklahoma in July 2008. Beer was bottled in April 2008. Pours an amber color with ruby hues. No head or lacing. Smell is sweet and somewhat fruity. Taste is much more complex than I thought it would be. Sweet candy/caramel, brown sugar, dark fruit and booze. VERY alcoholic. Limits its drinkability. Good brew. Glad I picked it up."
"D- I do like this in an odd self punishing way, however this is a niche product. It is damn near fermented fruit nectar and not something your going to finish quickly or have more than one of hence the score."
"Nice drinkability for 15.53%. I remember having one of these when I was newly 21 and loving it right up to the point when it hit me upside the head with its hidden potential. Very good."
"Just too much, ends up being a sweet, syrupy mess. Maybe a better palate than mine can take the blows from this one and still stand up to it, just felt utterly unbalanced. This one felt a bit young - let it sit for another 3-5 years. 12 oz may be a bit much as well."
"The drink is silky, medium-bodied, and surprisingly drinkable-- meaning I think I'll be able to finish the whole 12-ouncer before the core degenerates into the China Syndrome from Hell. 3 years of aging did this beer a real service, and I wouldn't hesitate to throw another case in the cellar except for the arm/leg price point of this truly excellent brew. Worth trying, actually only a little evil, damned tasty and truly superb with a little age on it."
"definitely worth saving for future enjoyment!"
"Poured a burnt orange with a small white one head. Nose is big malt, hops and booze. Taste is sugary and hot. Lots of caramel, malts, wood chips and vanilla. Mouthfeel is nice thick and chewy. This is one massive beer that can bring down even the heaviest hitters. I could not consume another one of these but the one I did drink was awesome."
"Not very drinkable. It's a great beer, but the ABV and strong flavors cut down on one's ability to drink even a full bottle."
"Certainly a sipper, a good nightcap but limited drinkability, as expected, due to intense sweetness and high ABV."
"2007 bottling, picked it up for half price to give it a try. Glad I did, it was a powerful blast of flavor. I'm starting to understand why the barrel-aged beers are so popular!"
"I could hardly finish a 12 oz split between two people, this beer is a sipper, but it is worth trying if you enjoy oaky and yeasty characters."
"D: Dangerously drinkable for the ABV. Tasty all around and dangerous. I think I'll let the other bottle age for a few more years and see if the booze mellows out anymore. Solid beer, and I'm glad to have the girlfriend here to help me with it."
"The closest thing in my experience that I can compare this brew to is Great Divide's Oak-Aged Yeti Imperial Stout. Though both are very good, I prefer the Yeti because the lower ABV leaves room for a more interesting flavor profile. This is quite nice, but a little too much like sipping bourbon for me (nothing wrong with sipping bourbon; just that I'd buy bourbon and not an ale for that experience.)"
"D: Well this is a massive beer that despite the high ABV is easy to drink especially if you are in the mood. I would recommend some Venom, Slayer, or Danzig for this one. Very impressive and helps throw things into a nice whirl. The only drawback is that it does not come that cheap."
"I enjoyed this beer, but it's not for everyone due to its strength. But while strong, it is not overbearing. Makes for a great winter warmer, but most probably won't have more than one."
"Out of a bottle this mildly intimidating beer (14.9% ALC!) was a hazy deep amber color. The one finger head was tan, displayed mediocre retention and modest lacing. The aroma was of alcohol esters and heat, oak, ripe fruit and doughy malt. The flavors were very rich and sweet. The alcohol was also quite strong. Caramel malt kicked the door in with brown sugar, vanilla and oak in the middle. Fruity esters and candy sugar were in there too. I generally like sweeter beers but I kept feeling this one was truly cloying. The body was medium/full, the mouthfeel average and the carbonation apropos for the style. Probably a real gem when aged, but it would need years."
"Drinkable now but it is a bit hot and rough."
"Purchased at Brawleys Beverage in Charlotte. Very nice looking beer when poured and honestly the coolest label I've every seen! Has a nice creamy tan head and dark brown cloudy body. There's little bits of yeast sediment in it and probably due to the age, this bottle was sealed in april '07. Smell is very malty, little alcohol notes in there with some oak flavor. Malts are thick and that of sweet raisens and dates. Flavor is great, tons of malts and sweet fruits. Alcohol comes in mid way through but the sweet malts and little spiceyness comes in to counter it quickly. Love this beer, one of my favorites!"
"Pours a very murky rust color and has a thin quickly fading head. The aroma is very boozy with big ripened fruits (plum), sugary malts, oak, and light band aid. It actually smells quite inviting. The flavor is rich heavy fermented fruits, dates, big malt and maple. It seems the appearance gets better as it warms. Giving it a little swirl creates a head and sticky lacing. I have a habit of drinking my beers too quickly but I think this one is going to last me for quite some time. Very nice overall. A true sipper."
"D - Drink after Christmas dinner. We did and we were left impressed by this under-rated brew! I probably shouldn't drink a few of these but I definitely would. Careful, it's a hitter with a high ABV."
"Disappointing. Pours brown with floaties suspended in the thick, carbonation-free liquid. No head could be forced from this one. Aroma is very nice, sweet and caramel with a heavy oak quality. The oak is very apparent in the taste, just as the description points out. Problem is it only enhances the overly sweet caramel-malt of this brew. The alcohol came out as the beer warmed, making this sticky-sweet syrup that became undrinkable. I will try this again, and pray I just got a bad bottle this time around. Maybe it will have gone down from its oppressive $8 a 12-oz price."
"Finish is sickly sweet but enjoyable nonetheless."
"Lots of sediment in the body. Milky white head on to this dark orange, almost brown beer. Very aromic. It's big on oak and caramel, a bit of fruity alcohol. Now I hope this isn't too hot to handle. Damn...I'm smoking fumes from my nose. Very very mellow flavor, and yet so darn tasty. Lots of oak and sweet candy...caramel and toffee flavor, fruity. It melts on your palate very pleasantly, that's for sure. You can feel the alcohol, but that's mostly in the throat, not on the palate. I'm loving this, I just wish there was less sediment. Sit back and sip on!"
"I am not sure I have ever had anything quite like this before, Drinks more like hard liquor than beer. Very dark orange color with a small tan head. Very pungent nose of ripe fruit and oak. Smooth mouthfeel and the alcohol is well hidden for something the powerful. Flavor of caramel malts, citrus hops, and ripe fruit. Probably not for everyone but I enjoyed it."
"The aroma and taste are so sweet you would swear that there is syrup in it. Very vinous as well. The appearance is golden orange. Flavor is oak like with a somewhat liquor quality. Palate is thick and smooth. Very Good! Even though it's really strong it doesn't knock out your taste buds."
"D- Although I began to feel the alcohol before finishing the beer, it was certainly not harsh at all and overall pretty smooth given the alcohol content."
"Notes from 4/27/07"
"Obviously a monster. Wouldn't want to chug this one. But, the overall arch is that it is really powerful. The sum of the parts is less that the whole, it you know what I mean. I will definately get this again if I need to catch a buzz. But not for the taste."
"Pours a cloudy copper with amber tints and decent carbonation leading to a small head. A very thick smell of sweet malts and some dark fruits. I am not sure what I smelled, the aroma was all over the place here. Unbelievable sweet malt taste that knocks you on your ass and there seems to be some floral hops to punctuate a vivid thickness of this beer and give it a slightly hoppy backend. Despite the high ABV the alcohol burn isn't too bad, but this is only a sipper and I still couldn't finish it all. It is like drinking a milkshake it is so thick and as it warms it got a little rough on my throat. This is a dessert beer to split with somebody on a cold winter night for a good occasion."
"Pours a ruby brown color, lighter edges. Off-white head, frothy but small. Hoppy aroma, grapefruit. Dark woodsy scent, malts and alcohol. Aroma of spices when inhaling deeply, some sweetness and caramel. Caramel and sweetness, dark raisin-y taste. Spices, clove. Sickly sweet aftertaste. Warming up...taste of something dark might be the oak - a hard flavor. A lot of alcohol. Too alcoholy."
"Drinkability- Very nice! Will be having more of these in the future. I think they are up to about $9 each now though, which makes it a rare buy."
"Okay, so the aroma still kind of puts me off--entices me then stinks me out--but the rest of this ale is gorgeous, though not deceptive. I'd love to have another one, but know better than that to have another one, this one has nearly looped me enough. Any more and it'd end in tears, tears that the prince of demons Samael would gladly drink himself I'm sure. Not this time buddy boy."
"M/D - The mouthfeel is pretty thin and not much is left to linger. The strong sour smell and the taste of strong alcohol and the fact of this brew being 14.9% makes it hard to finish."
"d: Ages well!!! Many of the flavor and aroma components are what you might find in an oak-aged chardonnay that has experienced Malolactic fermentation. I guess they oak has really influenced this beer."
"D: Brewed to be sipped. Share a bottle and take your time."
"Music enjoyed whilst sampling: None, but I could hear some coming from a party down the street."
"Its a light red/amber color with a small off white creamy head that exits pretty quickly, probably because the huge alcohol content. This was is very boozy smelling right of the bat but past that there is woody oak, candied fruit, slight vanilla and malt. The taste is again boozy and stingingly strong with alcohol, but there is a very sweet candied malt and fruit to go with the obvious oak flovor. It has a full and smooth body that is quite nice, unfortunately its overwellming boozyness detracts from the drinkability."
"Overall: only once baby"
"D. I am very glad I picked up several of these when I had the chance. This is a great beer to split with friends at a tasting."
"Bottled, April 2007. Pours a deep amber color with an impressive head considering the abv that quickly settles down to patches and a foamy ring. Aroma is sugary, cherries, oak, malt and some alcohol surfacing. The flavor is very sweet with caramel, plums, cherries, lots of oak with a spicy alcoholic finish. The beer is a bit hot and a little too sweet, even for an English Barleywine. Very warming and definitely a sipper. 12 ounces seemed to last forever. I wouldn't have wanted any more."
"Not bad drinkability for being so sweet and boozy, all things considered. Liqueur-like - glad I chose it for last night's nightcap, as it sure made me ready for a good night's rest. Interesting, and tasty, but it's a bit much - I wouldn't have minded splitting this one, though it's only a 12-ouncer."
"D: This one is certainly a sipper. I am surprised this one is a summer release since it has much more in common with winter warmers that most summer brews. The ABV and oak flavor make it tasty but you are not going to be able to knock these back one after another."
"I loved the aroma. It was sweet and figgy and of oak. I also got a deep dark fruit smell like. The taste was sweet wine like with a oak chip finish. It almost becomes cloying but walks the line and remains nice and sweet. On the finish you get the tinge of alcohol and the oak. Very nice. Overall a fun experience and will buy one of these every year or every two years."
"so, 227 reviews as of my posting. Guess this has been around a wide area. Bottle note's this is batch 4. Over 15% abv as noted on the label and it requires a very slow sipping approach to handle. I've got a couple more in the cellar to age and share with adventurous friends. I'll note it's probably too strong for me to buy more."
"Two years aged, this poured a hazy burnt sienna with no head. It smelled like very strong dried apricot hops, sweet caramel malt, melted butter, and a hint of oak and alcohol. It tasted like powerful and sweet apricot and raisin hops, fresh cut oak, super sugary caramel, and blatant alcohol. It was somewhat thick with a bit of carbonation, and had a strong and lasting bittersweet aftertaste. Overall this was a very unique and bold ale, that drank almost like a cordial. It was fairly complex, but was still clean. It's overwhelming sweetness was reminiscent of the 120 Minute IPA, meaning this beer must be sipped, and it's difficult to finish an entire bottle."
"Mouthfeel is sticky and full bodied. This is a winner!"
"Poured a great dark copper color with great head and excellent lacing. It had a wonderful aroma, very fruity, with fig and grape scents, with a wonderful maltiness to go with it, very deep and strong. Wondeful taste, very strong and deep, with wondeful malty and fruity characteristics (fig mostly, with a little grape). It went down wondefully smooth for such a high ABV beer. Fantastic!"
"the very sweet flavor and the high alcohol cut down drinkability slightly. otherwise quite enjoyable for me."
"Pours a one finger cream head that fades quickly to a ring leaving no lace. Murky amber color. Light carbonation and heavy bodied. Sweet alcohol nose. Flavor is a strong molasses and woodiness with late alcohol warming. Drink this cold. Pricey at $8.19 for a 12oz bottle from Yankee Spirits South Attleboro, Ma. 2005 vintage."
"D - Because of the sweet, it's a sipper."
"Drinkability is moderate. Flavor is decent, however alcohol is high and it is fairly harsh. Definitely a sipper."
"Quite simply, one of the very best beers I'd ever had, and one of the three best I've ever had from Avery. A triumph."
"D - The 15.5% ABV is very warming and demands some respect. This is a decent sipper as a night-cap, not something I'll probably try again in the summer heat, but would welcome it again on a cold winter night."
"An interesting brew that would probably age well and tone down nicely...worth a try for sure."
"Is quite drinkable for the abv, surprising actually. It is a sipper, definitely a one a done, no need for a second of this brew."
"M/D: Creamy, full body. Nice mouthfeel. Drinkability, well... This is a big, bold beer and I don't know much I could take. Overall, a very good beer."
"D - Possibly the best ESA I've had."
"I'm pretty torn over this one. I really like the nose, and I really like the overall flavor, but the alcohol and harsh finish detract a lot from my ability to really enjoy this beer. It's good in most respects, but kind of sharp. Interestingly, the more I drink, the more I enjoy it, but sip slowly!"
"D - Even tasting the alcohol, this one is pretty drinkable, considering it makeup."
"Overall this is quite nice, but one that is a bit too sweet for me to consume much at one time. A definite sipper."
"Pours a beautifully clear amber, orange, reddish color without much head or lacing. Aroma is boozy, oakey, sweet caramel, some raisins. Taste is oak and bourbon but sweet, fruity, caramel malts. Carbonation is low, Mouthfeel is sweet and sticky. Good brew, definitely a sipper."
"Drinkabilty was really high for me. In spite of the crippling ABV, the taste is smooth and the booze is clean, and my 12 ounces went down way to fast! I really like English style barleywines though, and am really digging this over the top take on the style by Avery. I happy to say they have another winner in their The Demons of Ale series, 3 for 3 with the extreme beers, love it! Part of my high scoring reflects the level of craftsmanship exhibited by pushing the envelope while still producing a very tasty, highly drinkable product."
"If you've got 'em, sit on 'em!"
"Overall: Very glad I decided to purchase and sample this beer. It's just a little too sweet for my general preferences, but could be good for pairing and special tasting occasions."
"D: Again age does this beer wonders. Still a sipper though. The ABV cuts down the drinkability for me but I would not have minded drinking the whole 12oz myself. Never drink this fresh."
"D- This is what is meant by ""sipper."" Mouthfeel is way too heavy for easy drinking and the ABV is such that its a good idea to split a 12oz bottle if you have any desire to do anything else during the day."
"A very quality barleywine, and worth a purchase, but may be a bit too expensive."
"D - Overall, this beer feels more like a liquor on ice than beer. This beer is not for a session or even part of a session really, but a quiet night with a relaxing drink that you'd just like to sip and enjoy would probably be the best setting. The aging of it probably helped, bringing some of the bourbon to the forefront which I enjoyed. With proper aging again and another beautiful night, I would have again."
"This is the definition of a sipper. Intense flavors run rampant on the palate and the thickness of the body allows them to stay beyond expected. While most beers rush straight to the aftertaste, this one lingers on the tongue. Unless you've paired this beer with something along the lines of sourdough bread it will be some time before you reach for the glass again simply because your tastebuds won't be fully recovered yet. Additionally, while alcohol is highly present in the beer the abv still manages to sneak up on you. Overall while I'm not too thrilled about the lack of balance, it still manages complexity and is definitely a unique, albeit overwhelming, beer."
"The drinkability is what i would expected from a beer like this, one is enough and i could see most people wanting to share one with a friend or two."
"First experience with this beer and probably my last, could age for another two to three years probably, certainly not my favorite from Avery, not recommended"
"A little bit of this would go a long way. Impressive, but a single glass would be all I could ever drink."
"D: I am probably being generous giving this a ""3" -- it's definitely a sipper. In fact, in my opinion this is closer to a cognac or bourbon -- i.e., liquor -- than it is to a beer. Slow going at this strength (unmasked strength at that) is a necessity."
"So this is what a good barleywine tastes like. It took me a while while to get used to this style, but I really enjoy this. Something that I will savor."
"This beer falls into the slow sipper category (for me at least). Has a huge warming alcohol presence on the tongue, fruity and sweet."
"This is too much for me--I believe that it is sweeter than a port and the alcohol is three beers worth. I will have trouble finishing it."
"D - well, this is quite the beer! Very solid and very heavy. Not sure I could rock more than 1 of these, but I'm glad to say I've had it. Not life-changing, but still quite interesting and worth a shot I'd say. Keep it up, Avery."
"Once again, Avery has hit the nail on the head for me. This one is a beer to savor. Poured with a surprising amount of head for a 14% barley wine. I love the oak aroma, which mingles perfectly with the slightly toasty malt aroma that I get out of it. Dangerously drinkable, not at all syrupy (the way some beers of this strength seem to coat your mouth), no warming sensation on the way down like you might expect, perfect level of bitterness, seemingly more from the roast on the malt rather than a pronounced hop presence. Some Braunschweiger and toasted rye would be fantastic with this."
"D - It's ok. I'm not totally impressed with this. I've had better."
"D = I was a little worried about this one when I smelled it and there seemed to be somewhat of an alcohol kick in the nose, but the taste and mouthfeel was excellent. A very strong brew that you may only want occasionally but this is an excellent beer. Now I need to go get more for cellaring."
"I had no trouble drinking this beer, but I must take points away for the excess of candy sugar."
"As one of the eccentric samples from Avery's ""big beer series", copped this single 12oz bottle for about $8.99 from Wine and Beverage Depot in Totowa... Picture of a dark angel with wings with the logo ""Ale flavored with oak chips"". ""Bottled in May 2006 - Batch 2"" on the side-sticker. At a very hefty 14.9% ABV, wasn't quite sure what to expect... upon opening the cap, I was greeted with an ultra-powerful caramel, honey, and dark-sugar aroma that was strong and noticeable... The taste is extremely powerful, rich, thick, creamy, cloying and really sweet... Strangely, I didn't taste the alcohol that I was anticipating - just an extremely sweet - to the point of being unbearable - flavor that stuck to the mouth... this one is certainly a sipper - one that should be sampled over a period of time... it's so strong that you could probably split this 12oz bottle with two or three people... In terms of flavor, this beer is really extreme... the mouthfeel was very thick and ultra-sweet... With respect to appearance, this pours a dark, copper color with minimal head... For the heavy price I paid for this brew and the extreme flavor, I wouldn't purchase this one again, but it was worth a try... Overall, way too sweet and thick to be truly enjoyable..."
"I like this one, and would put it in the rotation for winter beers."
"Definately a sipper to be shared with a few friends. Another unique tasting from Avery."
"Great beer and great take on the barleywine style."
"d: A sipper of course, and pretty enjoyable one. Not for the weak of palate."
"Overall, I say this beer is far to sweet and unbalanced. I recommend tasting this with a friend or two, perhaps 4 or 6oz would be the perfect amount.But 12oz alone is just to much to drink of this strong ale... flavored with oak chips?"
"Drinkability - eight bucks a bottle is a stiff price to pay, but I like this one and would consider putting another one down in storage."
"D- At almost 15%abv, this is definitely a sipping beer to enjoy over time, i can only imagine how wonderful this would be with a few more years of aging, i am a big fan of Avery and this may be my current favorite from this brewery"
"Interestingly drinkable given the rocket fuel level abv, however, while there is slightly detectable alcohol in the taste and aroma, it is a very easy drinking, yet ballsy and fascinating beer. I love the expressive nose in this barley wine which is why I rated it exceptional in that category. One fine brew and one of the best barley wines available. Highly recommended!"
"Drinkability - Alcohol presence was there but not harsh. I felt this beer was just too sweet for my liking. 12 oz was too much."
"I thought this beer was pretty good, and was definitely interesting."
"12 ounce bottle, 2005 vintage 14.5% ABV. Served in a snifter, the beer pours a cloudy brown/orange/copper color with a very small tan head. Head retention is low, but the lacing is good. It smells boozy, like sherry, oak, figs/raisins, and vanilla. The taste is very, very sweet. It tastes like sherry/booze, brown sugar, vanilla, figs, and oak. It's a very malty tasting beer, I can't taste any hops at all (that's not a bad thing in this case). Mouthfeel is full, it's thick and syrupy in the mouth. Drinkability is pretty good too, considering the ABV and the sweetness. I think this beer has aged pretty well, I'm disappointed that this is the only bottle I had. I'm drinking this faster than I should, but I think it's pretty good. It really should be a sipping beer just because of the ABV. I'd definitely recommend this to others, but maybe age it a while before drinking it."
"Pours into a snifter a beautiful light, golden color with no head by the time the beer arrived at our table. Smell is malt, sugary, caramel, molasses, alcohol, and strong oak notes. Taste is of nutmeg, alcohol, some dried fruit in the distance. Mouthfeeling is smooth, like a fine cognac, and a slight alcohol burn in the chest is present as well. Very sticky mouthfeeling. Absolutely very nice beer! Enjoyed every sip."
"Wow! Maybe I should have aged this a little bit longer. The oak flavor in this was over-powering. It was almost like biting into an oak tree. Still delicious though. Very dark amber in color with not much head. Oak, raisin and other dark fruits in aroma. Very sugary. The alcohol is also noticeably present."
"D: AWESOME!!!! This beer would be perfect after dinner. It warms your tummy."
" Overall to say I was impressed would be putting it lightly. I am usually one for big brews, just tend to back off when they get this big. This one however really seemed to hold its own. It was soo mellowed and drinkable, it was almost a shame I did not have another, although that is probably a good thing. I wish I had aged more then one as this was really quite nice and was perfect over the course of a couple hours to just sit and relax with. Definitly recommend trying this one."
"Pours a ruddy orangey copper color with virtually no head other that a thin collar around the inside of the snifter. Some green apple aromas, sugary maltiness, oak and possibly some spices, but dull. Flavor is mostly sweet malt with some nuances of oak shining through. A slight cideriness amidst the big alcohol kick. Oak chips adds to its smoothness and takes a little edge off this big beer. An enjoyable slow sipper."
"Very thick, a definite ""sipper"" beer due to its massive body and alcohol presence, massive complexity makes this something you have to take your time with. I would like to drink a lot more of this though..."
"Pours a ruby hued brown with a finger of creamy light tan head that dies quickly leaving sheets of lace. Smells of sweet bourbon, oak, cherry and malt. Stings the nose. Taste is very sweet. Boozy with a sherry character. The oak chips are prominant. Syrupy and spicy. Full and sticky in the mouth. A gynormous brew that must be sipped spurratically. Would be very interested to revisit one of these after aging a few years as there are many flavors but all buried by the booze."
"Drinkability - this is a decent ale, but not a great one, so that limits its drinkability for me. But it also has a very high abv, which alone makes this a sipper and not sessionable."
"Drinkability: A tough one to consume; I don't mind sweet beers as much as some but this one lacks complexity"
"Toos strong for my enjoyment, especially at lunchtime. but a wellmade beer that does a good job of minimizing yhe high alcohol sensation."
"Mouthfeel: It has an appropriate amount of carbonation, but it's so sweet it's hard to drink and with the very high alcohol content, this is a sipper. Has characteristics of a tawny port."
"Great evening brew."
"Overall impressions... I like it, but probably just this once. The alcohol is overwhelming at times."
"Overall: I would call it unique. This is a big flavored beer. Tons of Oak and Booze. If I did not know any beer I would think the glass contains Bourbon. It is very sweet, I like it, but I could see how it would be over the top in sweetness for most. It is not sessionable at all. I sipped the entire bottle. It left me warm and happy. There are many better brews out there, and several better by Avery, but this one is unique. If you have not tried it, grab one and give it a shot. It's an experience."
"I don't think I'll be buying any more of this one"
"Bottled May 2006, Batch 2. Pours a dark amber with a thin head that is still much more than you'd expect for a beer this strong, spotty lacing lasts on my Stone Old Guardian glass. The aroma is dominated by alcohol and sweet caramel with a hint of oak. The taste is very complex, but the general medicine-like alcohol gets in the way. There is a good blend of oak, vanilla, caramel and a nice but sharp pine hoppiness provides the best backbone it can for all that malt. The beer is very heavy on the palate and very sweet. This is one that takes a long time to drink, and pretty much leaves me ready to go to bed."
"D: A REAL sipper (it's a brut, but I like it)."
"This brew pours a hazy brown-ruby color. The head is massive, billowy, thick, and recedes very slowly into thick lacing, and leaves foam stuck to the side of the glass. The aroma is of dates, plums, hints of caramel, maple syrup, smoke, and oak. It reminds me a lot of a good Australian Rare Tokay. The taste is a mirror image of the aroma. The mouthfeel is full bodied with a high level of carbonation. Overall, really like this beer. It borders into dessert wine territory, but does a fine job of it. I can't wait to see how well this ages."
"Overall a very tasty brew that is more balanced than the other Barleywines I've tried to date. High alcohol is hidden well."
"Pours a slightly cloudy dark amber color, nice carbonation, nice little fizzy/creamy head, nice sticky lacing afterwards. The nose is sweet malty, bourbon, oaky, and nice touch of caramel. The taste is slightly sweet, malty, very nice touch of bourbon, oak, some caramel. The ABV is hidden well for this brew, nice warm feeling going down. Medium body, very well done brew. Very drinkable, this is a very nice/tasty barleywine, one of the best I've had to date, highly recommended."
"I was very suprised to find this beer so easy to drink. The oak comes through nicely and even with the high alchol, it is very easy to drink. I intend to cellar a few and revisit them in a few years, I'm sure the malt will continue to mellow nicely. Avery has made a nice sipper here, great one to have on a cold winter's night. If you like Barley-Wines, this is a must-try."
"D- fair warning, you could choke on this beer if you do more than sip it, very potent stuff, complex, but i think Avery went to far with this one, worth a drink though its a tough one to drink"
"My heartfelt thanks to beerbeing for this brew, sent in the BA annv. club."
"Lucious amber color with thin-to-no head. Aroma is definitely sweet- hints of vanilla, light fruit. Taste is rich and sweet, faint vanilla and oak, a bit hot. Mouth is thick and viscous, alcohol burn on the finish. Reminds me more of an old ale in flavor, perhaps. Rich and complex. A fine sipper."
"Bleagh, I find myself unable to finish the last 2/3rds of this. Too sweet by half."
"Notes: I liked this almost exactly the same as the 2005 version as its identical to my palate. I put almost a year on this bottle of 2006 and that seems about perfect to me. It still has that spicey alcohol edge and the only difference is in the malt bill as it settled into a thicker more complex body."
"Drinkability - This is a sipper and the ABV will keep this from being something i return to time and time again. I feel like having more hops would help balance the beer."
"Bottle courtesy of Boboski: Poured a clear dark amber color ale with a small foamy head with little retention and no lacing. Aroma of brown sugar is domination with some subtle alcohol signs. Taste is dominated by some very sweet malt with very little hops and also very little signs of oak. Alcohol was way too predominant and the beer was way too sweet for my personal taste. It seems that Avery big beers series are either hit or miss and this one would be a miss."
"D- It's so complex, so sweet, and so alcoholic, that you can't drink much... unless you're a fan of beers such as EKU 28. if you get the chance, TRY THIS BEER. But share it."
"Drinkability  This is one of the more drinkable samples from the Avery booze dungeon. It didnt get a stellar rating but I will buy occasionally."
"Drinks alright, the dryness & smokeyness detract some. I'll take this over the beast or the devil stout Mestophiles any day"
"This is a special big hitter in my book...I'd certainly purchase this again if given the chance."
"It's not that I wasn't impressed with Samael's drinkability, but there's simply too much going on in this beer. The alcohol and aromatics overpower the aroma and flavor of the beer. Was it worth the $7.95 that I paid? I don't believe so. Is it a bad beer? No. But next time, I think I'll reach for a bottle of scotch instead."
"A slight burn and this brew slides down to a 'worth a try' beer. Interesting, though."
"Poured straight down the center of the glass into a nonic the head is rather tight, sits an inch thick with good retention and slight lacing. The body is a deep slightly hazy reddish orange. Smells of sweet malt, lots of esters (tropical fruity) some banana, candies pear, plum, port like scents, sugar, and little cinnamon. Alcohol is present, but not over powering. The hops are a little over overwhelmed in the nose. The taste, sweet rich body with nice carbonation to keep it from being too syrupy, the hops come out in the middle with a little bitterness and some alcohol warmth to finish. The oak can be experience much more as it worms up, very slight but nice nuance. This is a tasty barley wine, approachable, but definitely not for the faint of heart. A Syrupy sweet, yet complex punch in the face. Try it for crap sake."
" Whoa. This is a big beer. There is a sharp sweetness that I don't care for. Various sugary flavors running rampant. This is simply not ready to drink. Mouthfeel is thick and syrupy. To say that it is coating doesn't come close to explaining it. Not drinkable by a long shot."
"Brewed in May 2006. Pours clear and orange-amber, with a surprisingly large head for something this alcoholic. Big vanilla aromas (not surprising, considering it's flavored with American oak chips) but also a compelling mango aroma, some butter and spice. On the palate, initially just a touch acidic and fruity (the mango again comes to the fore, along with some apricots) before growing sweeter and sweeter through the finish, which stays sharply and cloyingly sweet. It's not my favorite part of this beer. There's a burst of fruit and raw alcohol at the end. Substantial carbonation throughout the palate, which is kind of surprising given the style. Overall, this is rather good. I'm surprised I liked it as much as I did... the vanilla oakiness wasn't too overbearing, as it was attenuated by some fruit. The carbonation also helped it from becoming too heavy. Not bad at all, and certainly original."
"My rough plan is to drink a bottle a year for the next five years, but I have very serious doubts it'll last that long. (Ummm, anyone out there who wants to trade some truly unique, rare, big beer, like Dark Lord, Utopias, Millennium, etc., beermail me.) I LOVE this stuff. It might well be one of my five favorite beers in the world, out of well over a thousand I've tasted."
"This beer is thick and oily. Not much carbonation. Not very drinkable. Too sweet. Too much of an alcohol burn. It's worth giving a shot."
"This is remarkably mellow, the sweet elements and huge alcohol thankfully don't dominate...no doubt helped by the 9 months in the bottle, and it would be probably still be quite drinkable at ten times that age. It's a pricey bastard ($8.49 per 12 oz. bottle) but because it's so damn good, and lasts as long as a 22 ouncer, I'd purchase it again."
"Batch 2, bottled May 2006. 4 months oldfor a barley wine is pretty young, but here we go. Medium brown with a light orange hue, semi-cloudy haze with an off white fizzy head that dissapears quickly. Lots of stuff going on in the nose, apple, orange, grapefruit, red wine, port, oak, raisin. The only down side of the nose is how faint it is. I had to cover the glass with my hand and inhale deeply to get all these nuances. Not a fill the room nose. The same cannot be said for the taste, which I can say right off the bat would benefit from some serious aging. This is huge, real big. Tremendous amount of malt and sweet raisins. Everything fromt he nose is here, along with some pine, a little smokyness, and cherry. As you drink this, the red wine notes in the nose fill your nose, and take center stage there. Truly amazing, wine inthe nose, beer int he mouth. Despite it's Schwartzenegger approach to attacking my palate, it actually finishes quite cleanly. The warmth is still there, but it's not cloying or distractive, it's pleasent. I can't believe how drinkable this is."
"A barleywine that will certainly satisfy your sweet tooth. Thanks to Quaffer for the chance to try this one!"
"Insanely sweet at first, with flavors of overripe fig and belgian candied sugar, gives way to hot alcohol, sherry-like in its nuttiness. Subtle oaked nuances are present throughout, lending the beer a vanilla aspect, though they never dominate. Mouthfeel is slick and viscous, and as you let this warm in the mouth it takes on a distinct chardonnay oaked quality. A touch too sweet, but intriquing nonetheless."
"Super sticky thick and mild carbonation. I'm tempted to dilute this with water to make it more drinkable, because, as is, I'm having a hard time."
"Definitely a sipper. I will reserve this for that quiet time at the end of the day."
"12 oz bottle that I purchased six months ago and paid an arm and a leg for (well, not really but $7 is a lot to me for one beer). The color is a really nice cloudy orange with a small 2 cm off-white head. The smell is of hi-octane alcohol and not much else; as Papa Burgundy would say stings the nostrils. The taste is very close to whiskey with a little sweetness. This is not quite as bad as Mephistopheles but it isnt great. This really isnt a beer to me but more an after-dinner liqueur like a cognac or bourbon. This is way too big for me and not recommended unless you like liquor-beers. The only reason I cracked this was because I spent four hours in traffic due to a blizzard and my belly needed warming. This beer is good for that."
"also, on a positive note, the mouthfeel is perfect (slightly fizzy, yet thick- however not too sticky.. kinda creamy) and drinkability, for this abv, is decent.. although i think that's due to the sweetness here. not sure that heaps of turbinado sugar is a proper way to skillfully mask abv, but whatever. probably won't revisit a third time, twice was puh-lenty."
"A sipping beer for sure. It sort of tastes like an english barley-wine reduction. It's just so syrupy sweet it's almost hard to drink, but it's still very good. Definitely a beer to share, even for 12-oz."
"Thank God I was able to split a small bottle of this with the crowd at the Coastal Wine Connections beer tasting. This destroys your olfactory senses with a big sugary caramel ""pow"" ... Powerfully sweet with a cooked fruit sweetness, just a light bitter or medicinal value, its incredibly smooth but with the power of a nuclear power plant. Bronze orange. This is the Eiswein of beer, almost a cognac. For sipping by the fire with a cigar. (#2673, 2/1/07)"
"Cheers!"
"This is one overpowering beer, and one of the highest ABV's I've sampled. Small bottle, but even that was hard to finish. I will probably get some more for special occasions though!"
"Thanks to enola for the experiance."
"Mmmm, this a killer diller, but not impossible to like. Full flavored, full bodied, long, fruity, boozy finish. And wholly unique."
"Update: dumped this down the sink, couldn't finish. Bleh!"
"D - I wont look for this again, and I should have drank only half. Way too sweet."
"Deep reddish orange amber body is very attractive. Almost 3 fingers of fat tan head that leaves nice lace as it fades. Nose is vibrant with spicey fruit notes, creamy vanilla hints also exist. Super sweet syrupy feel coats the mouth at first sip. Kind of like a thin port. Carmeled malts and soured sweetness dominate the palate. You catch notes of plum and waxy cherry candy. Alchol warms the belly well, but is well hidden in the taste. Nice sipping style. Quite drinkable, but only one at a time. Wow!"
"I really am not sure I even want to finish this beer. It's just not that good. I actually felt inclined to write this solely because this beer was so poor."
"Kind of a scarlet red hue. Carbonation is visible in the murkiness of the beer. It slowly surfaces to a thin crop of tan head. Lace is minimal. Aroma is very sweet. Rich feel to it. Some fruitiness underneath all the sweets. Candied plums and tropical varieties come to mind. On the palate, it's sweet up front, but not cloying as I feared. It's very rich overall. The finish brings a little heat, but again, not as much as I was expecting. This beer is put together pretty nicely. It's got lots of those tropical fruits dancing around. Like pineapples and mango and maybe some papaya. And even a ghostly coconut presence. Cherry and nougat and oak strike as well. The beer has a nice bit of carbonation to it to prevent a syrupy mouthfeel. Body is checking in around medium. Maybe medium-full. This is pretty good for being such a heavyweight."
"This is a very strong ale. I wouldn't recommend drinking it out of anything other than a snifter or tulip, or another small glass that enhances aromas and promotes slow sipping. Perhaps even taking small sips out of a shotglass is appropriate. All I could do was take small sips and let the flavor soak in. I recommend starting out at a temperature of 40-45 degrees, as this will take a while to enjoy. I feel if it gets too warm, the alcohol may become too overpowering and turn a great beer into paint thinner flavored soda. Don't be intimidated by this Barley Wine's high alcohol by volume, as the complexity makes up for it. This is a beer that can be enjoyed alone among the melodies of your favorite relaxation music, or shared with friends to calm the night. This one gets my full respect."
"Thats my opinion anyway, I think it would be much better about with half the heat. I will not purchase again."
"I'm a likin' this brew. This could be my favorite Avery brew since Avery 10. There is a lot of port-wine characteristics in this beer. Shy with the hops, this Barley Wine ascends the style in which it is characterized. Very sweet, syrupy, and oily looking right from the offset. With a deep mohogany hue and a stark white head, it promises intense sweetness and richness. Aromas of sweet brandy-like alcohols, swirled around toffee, caramel, vanilla, rum, and bourbon (I think it is the oak). Tastes even sweeter than is suggested by the aromas. A follow up of rum-soaken cherries, berries, maple syrup, and heavy, heavy malts. Not teeth-hurting sweet, but close. High fruit-cake flavors with the dehydrated old fruits and sugar drenched breads. Heavy and sweet on the mouth. This one is surely a sipper. Very warming without fusals and with a sweet alcohol / oily feel. Finishes like a lot of dark rums and tawny ports that I have drank. This beer is phenominal. Better than Samichlaus in my opinion."
"Pours a syrupy deep burnt orange color with no head. Aroma is rum-soaked raisins, oak, fruity esters of apple and pear, slight bubblegum and alcohol dryness. Flavor is syrupy sweet of caramel malts, honey, raisins, bananas foster, french oak and vanilla. Peppery and spicy notes in the dry finish. Very warm from the 14.5% alcohol. Full Body, Low carbonation, and definitely a sipper."
"Smells of dark caramel, cherries, sweet candy sugar. Taste is very malty sweet with hops enough to back it up. Super lingering sweetness with tones of dark fruit, raisins, cherries. Very mild carbonation. Cloying sweetness as expected for a 14% ABV. Thick and sweet. Just a sipping brew, great for dessert."
"This brew is a rich copper color with a faint haze and a thickly packed off-white head. The aroma is fascinating: intense character of hops and alcohol, mingled with spicy phenols, fruit, vanilla, and wood. Its a complex aroma, with nothing subtle about it. The smell is a little jumbled, and lacks the a real well-crafted roundednessstill, theres a lot of great aromas in there. There taste is intensely sweet with an immediate warming. Very malty and sugary. It can get a little cloying, and could be a little more balanced. Still, its a solidly strong and enjoyable flavor. Againnothing subtle here. Full and thick mouthfeel. Quite drinkable, given the ABV. Id certainly have one of these again."
"Overall, this is an interesting experiment. If this were a homebrew I'd like it more, but it's just too out there and too expensive for me. I'd only recommend this for those who want to try beers that push the limits of what we think of as beer."
"OA: I like it ok, I would reach for a jw any day over this.. maybe in a big handful of years this will be more refined."
"Overall: This beer is ok. I hate to say it, but sometimes I am not overly fond of the whiskey flavor of barrel aged beers. Sorry."
"D: The drinkability is severely limited by the abv as well as the cloying sweetness."
" Drinkability not so hot. Probably wont be having anymore of these"
"D- Way to sweet and strong for me. The flavors are not well collected IMO. I don't think is to good at all. Which is a huge let down at $7 a bottle."
"Pours a clear reddish orange with a smallish white head. Not bad,but nothing really special either. The smell is extremely pungent with oak wood, burban,dark fruit, and a TON of alcohol. The taste is very sugary sweet with bourban, oak wood, dark fruit, and vanilla. This is sooo sweet it's hard to drink and with the very high alcohol this is a sipper. The m/f is heavy with the flavors mixing OK,not great,but Ok. A tough beer to drink, I think I'll be sipping this all night. ZZzzzz. Cheers."
"Drinkability is nice but certainly not anything other than a snifter type beer. One in a sitting is all I'd want but I will certainly visit this one again."
"12 oz. foil wrapped bottle. Brewed in 2005. 14.5% ABV, OG 1.146. Pours a very clear copper/amber color. Thin tan foamy head disappears immediately. The aroma hits you from across the room. Vanilla, orange, wood, some fusal alcohol, and rock candy. Very thick and syrupy, with almost no carbonation. Flavors are woody, very sweet, orange whisky marmalade, and other fruity. Thick and tongue coating, overly sweet with no bitterness to balance this one out. Very warming as well. This was interesting to try, but I could have split a bottle with someone."
"i am proud as all hell about finding this bottle. we were in Spec's in Houston and i was perusing the Avery shelf when i saw a little red foil topped bottle with no label. but on the shelf there was a tag that said avery oak aged ale. so i hassled a storekeep to put a UPC on it so i could buy it. no idea how old it was but i suspect fairly old because of how DELICIOUS it was. Poured red like a dark wine. very small flimsy head and not any ral carbonation. Stinky grape/musk/oak smell. very pungent. very sweet oak/grape/cherry/malt flavor. very complex and hard to parse apart the flavors. there was a lot more in there that im not able to identify. somewhat sour. very mellow overall and super delicious. maybe the best barleywine i've had."
"D: Hard to drink the 12oz by myself. Tastes and smells great, but I can't handle all the flavors and alcohol. May be better after a year or two in the cellar."
"Drinkability is just not really in this. Flavor level is like a Bass Sub-woofer that nearly shakes a car apart; some is good but too much can destroy. Too powerful for regular consumption."
"D: I could drink 1 or 2 of these, but i am sure the 14.5% would make me pay for any more that that...."
"At a conference in Collinsville with my boss and picked this up from a nearby liquor store. Unfortunately, had no glassware, so had to resort to a plastic cup in the room so I won't be talking about the head or appearance too much. This was a pleasant suprise - smell alternated between a sweet, malty beer to a jack and coke. Wasn't sure what to expect, but taste was delicious - complex, molasses with hints of plums, cherries and raisins - subtly arriving at the back of the tongue and warming quickly with the alcohol. Yes, the alcohol is present but it really didn't seem to be overpowering even at 14.5abv. Finishes a bit too sweet for my tastes - I usually expect more hops from a barleywine - but it was still delicious! Daddy recommends!"
"Drinkability: so-so. This may be better with some aging, but the alcohol bite just becomes overwhelming and tiring here."
"You can't sip this small enough to keep the sweetness and size in check. It's reasonably complex, with various elements daring to brave the profound sweetness. The ABV is obvious at every stop, and only a fool would ignore it. Perhaps it's a bit too big, and too sweet, but each lip-coating sip was easy enough, at least at the start. It's the end of the pint that presents the dilemma."
"Overall mouth feel, lingers in various parts of my throat & tongue."
"An interesting change of pace, but not one I'm planning to try again."
"A slow sipper for sure. The slippery front is just that. Making for a seemingly innocent session at first, but then it begins to sink its teeth into you and the 14.5% makes its way through for a slower session. It has good character, but somehow lacks the power, complexity, and the beefy hops I tend to like out of a Barleywine. Especially if its to be of the American style."
"2005 vintage. Pours dark copper to amber in color with an almost non-existant cream head that is faint and brief. A very rich prune and raisin aroma mix with a boozy aroma. There is also some fruit aromas, cherry-apple cider like qualities. Taste shows incredibly sweet maltiness, caramel and toffee flavors, prunes and grapes, and a nice spicy alcohol finish that is nice and warming. Medium to heavy in body, there is some serious alcohol in this one and it is pretty assertive in the aroma and taste but in a good way imo. The sweetness can also be fairly cloying, but I enjoy sipping this one. It is one of my favorite beers to drink with chinese food, esp a rich mandarin sauce."
"Slightly hazy, amber orange in color. Small head died to a film rather quickly, but hey, it's 14.5%. The aroma is very sweet and malty, with plenty of deep dark fruits, cherries and plums. The taste is thick and syrupy sweet. A sherry-like sting from the smokey, oak aged alcohol. Even some lighter, sweeter fruity flavors as it warms, reminded me a bit of white grapes. Eventhough it's at 14.5% alcohol, it really isn't more noticable than other beers that are around 8 or 9%. The mouthfeel is definitely sticky and a bit cloying, but not too bad for how sweet the beer is. This beer would probably benefit from a year or two of cellaring. This is a sipping beer, not something to enjoy a couple of when out with the boys."
"Notes: Could be beter could be worse, but not worth 8 bucks for 12 ounces with so many better barleywines out there."
"This is a wonderful beer, but most definately a sipper to accompany dinner or to have as a desert itself."
"Pours an brownish amber color with a small semi white head that dissapears fast to a thin ring around my glass. The smell is of lots of vanilla, some oak, caramel, brown sugar, maybe a hint of dried fruit, and oh yeah, alcohol. The taste was of mostly sweet caramel malt and vanilla, with more whiskey like qualaties than in the smell. There is only a light amount of carbonation which makes this beer seem very thick. The oak only comes into play a tiny bit as it is drowned out by the heavy dose of alcohol. The flavors seem to be rough around the edges with some of the sweetness needing just as much mellowing as the whiskey. All in all this is one to sit on for a few years. If the whiskey like flavors develop well this will be a whopper of a beer."
"2005 bottling: This pours into the glass a clear, amber color. There was just a bit of an off-white head that was gone almost instantly. The aroma is quite potent. There is a big sweetness to it. Vanilla is the main component, with some caramel and alcohol also. The taste is a bit syrupy and sweet. Alcohol is evident. Im not sure where the oak chips come into this one. I think that this needs to sit for quite awhile. It should be good in a few years."
"Overall: Not as harsh as I was led to believe by others, or for that matter even expected, especially given that this is a 14.5% ABV brewanderm.well, not to be too shy..or to put too fine a point it..an Avery brew. Maybe the Batch #2 is not as harsh as the Batch 1; but it could still do with some time in the bottle I think. Like most of the Avery brews, a big hitter and an interesting detour into über-beer-geek land, but not one I would buy again. Worth trying though, if you have the money to splash.cuz at 50+ cents a fluid ounce, it aint cheap."
"Mainly clear bright polished copper appearance. Does generate a head, yellowish and of average duration. Laces in simple dripping rings. Aroma works, lots of wood and a strong vanilla presence. Mouthfeel is thick with average carbonation, not too syrupy but slightly sticky -- but more bubbles than I expected. Flavor has a distracting alcoholic bite, not as much raw kerosene as the Beast, but a little heavy-going. Vanilla continues in the taste, charred on-a-grill fruits (nectarines, golden delicious apples), lots of residual sugars. Hops don't come into play. I never really think these types of beer are close to bourbon, but the alcohol is very apparent in the finish and in the stomach, taking away from the next sip and the second half of the flavor profile."
"Medium to full body, syrupy describes it best, with low carbonation. Considering the ABV this is remarkable smooth and well balanced. Everything melds together nicely. Nice alcohol warming, and I actually find it very easy going down. Certainly not sessionable, but definately something I'll have more of in the future. My only qualm would be why is this a seasonal in the dead of summer...this would be an ideal winter beer."
"Drinkability/notes: Simply put, superb. A must try."
"Pours an intense amber that is slightly hazy and with a nice tan head that dissapates quickly (14.5% will kill head retention). The aroma is an intense mix of whiskey and caramel notes, along with some oak and vanilla, molasses, fruits (plum, grape, apple) and alcohol. The flavor is equally intense as the aroma; notes of caramel and single malt scotch prevail, as well as dark fruits (cherries, plums, figs, grapes), oak and vanilla, slight mineraly hops, and of course alcohol. The mouthfeel is thick and syrupy, carbonation is minimal and drinkability is bad at best. A very interesting beer, reminds me of a good single malt with some maple syrup added...Avery is always pushing the limits of beer and this is no exception."
"Dark cherry red body with a small cap of white foam. Big fruit sweetness with plenty of sugar coming through as well to the point of being cloying. Alcohol was also pretty much in your face after this warmed a bit. Taste was more sugary syrup coated fruits with not much else to provide any sort of balance. Through the syrupy sticky sweetness the strong alcohol still manages to come through and provide a burn on the way down. Too much sweetness with only boozy notes to counter it. Pretty damn thick as expected but way to sticky and too much burning warmth. Drinkability was just about non existent as I slowly drank the 12 once bottled over a few hours. Easily the sweetest beer I have ever had I dont think Ill touch my other bottle for 5+ years."
"This one is a bugger. I found it difficult to purchase because of the high price/volume ratio, but thought I needed a little adventure. After pouring it into a glass, little head forms with no lacing. I was a bit disappointed to say the least until I took a nose and POW. Intense aromas were present, filled with strong alcohol, berry and malty tones all mixed together. It was a little intimidating to sip but the nose provides ample warning as to the flavors in which you will find, all of which are very intense. It was very sweet and malty with a bit of blueberry hidden underneath I think. The mouthfeel is immense with very light carbonation to make this brew smooth and easy to swallow. This is definitely not for the novice beer consumer, although it reminds me of a port a bit. At 14.5%ABV its not something to mess around with; I had to sip on this guy for a while. Overall, it lives up to the American Barleywine standards, powerful and alcoholic. I am a little disappointed however in the weak oak flavor I got. It was one of the selling points on this brew and I was pressed to pick up on any of the oak flavors."
"Mouthfeel is big, thick and dense. This is a sipper for sure. Goes down smooth without too much alcohol bite. Drinkability is definetly hindered due to the abv and the sweetness here. One bottle is more than enough. A very tasty brew, just needs to have the sweetness dialed down IMHO. I'm looking forward to the Mephistopheles in my cellar, as I sampled it at the EBF and enjoyed it quite a bit."
"Damn. What can I say? Im a sucker for big beers and this one hangs with the best of them. Im reminded a lot of DFHs Raison Dextra by Samael, except obviously with more oak. This is a very tasty sipper and one that I look forward to both cellaring and trying again."
"The body is rich and done well. Very impressive for such a large alcohol and this easy to drink. A velvety taste and limited esters. I guess I am a Sam I am drinker."
"This one is a sipper only with the ABV evident. Better with age? Maybe. This Demons of Ale Series was a great idea though. I'd love to see more stuff like this from Avery."
"I truly wish that Avery would release this beer agian. I think it could have used another year (or 4) in the cellar, but it is incredible right now. Quite possibly the single most complex beer that I have ever drank. Stunning."
"Lots of cherries and a handful of strawberries soaked for a week in brandy, then sprinkled with chocolate before being servered. Yawzah! This is a flavor smack upside the head. The alcohol screams through, burning a path behind it. Yet it's also a sugary sweet beer, candy and cake and all that. Serve cold and sip slowly, with respect. This is a wonderful beer, but also one that will knock you on your ass."
"Drinkability is solid but the strength of this brew kind of eliminates the taste buds for the rest of the night. Worth trying but be warned."
"I really enjoy this beer and would buy it almost anytime I see a bottle. This is a malt lovers brew and a sipper. Two of these and I am sure I would be all set for the nite. This is by far the best beer I have had from Avery and the best I have sampled in a while overall. Buy it if you see it and send me a few!!"
"Liquid desert. I think I killed my sweet-tooth for the month."
"Mouthfeel- Very syrupy yet with alittle velvet to help smooth out the heat from this high abv barley wine."
"Bottle date 2005, 14.5% ABV."
"to me, this beer is not very drinkable. the sticky sweetness and high alcohol don't make for a very enjoyable combo. needs some hops or something to balance it out. interesting, but not to my taste."
"Pours clear rich cherry amber. A noticably viscous pour that forewarns ""beyond - there be devils"" Samael was said to have planted the vine in the Garden of Eden - there are many parallels with the inviting sweet fruity aroma - wine like with french oak barrel -vanilla aroma, maybe a little cloying at start (but not thin bodied) satisfying fruity finish with oak and 9+% abv drying. No fusels! ABV just high enough to ""leg"" the sides of the 0.4 L rastal sniffer. Trapped vapors bring water to my eyes and the awesome flavors assult the mouth and nose. I repour and watch the sweet liquor decappitate its head with a single swing of alcoholic scythe (sometime known as a ""ley"" - used for cutting oats or barley and symbolically for death.) I remember the Dogfish Head's Old School Barley wine and find this is more drinkable. Happy to share this one with friends - tempt one of yours with this unique barleywines from Avery."
"Rich cherry color. Soft fruit and caramel in the aroma, with hints of apple and cherries, light vanilla, light toasted oak and alcohol. Exreme flavor, but in a respectful and succulant manner. Initially cloying and thin, but the finish is absolutely mindblowing with a lingering flavor of raisin and plump red fruit. Really rich. Im really impressed by this new offering from Avery. The best extreme beer Ive had in awhile."
"bottle from Marty's in Newton MA. served at chilled basement temperature. pours a dark amber, red color with curls of foam. a rim of foam remains. nose is of candy sugar, alcohol! the first sip is amazing. vanilla, sticky sweet alcohol syrup. I could eat this on or in pancakes or waffles. this is truly a strong sweetened barleywine. comparable to Old School from DFH but with more vanilla flavor and more body. the price tag of about $9/bottle makes this a rare treat. best shared. respect beer."
"Smelled of bourbon and vanilla. Honey red with no head. This actually has a pretty good flavor if you take REAL small sips. Vanilla and fruit (pear is big) flavors with small sips. Big sips make it like a shot of bourbon. Very Avery-like crazy creation."
"This beer is definitely a sipper. I'd like to see some roasted malt and more IBU's in this fallen angel to balance it out. A must-try."
"Overall Impression: Wow, intense. I thought it was like Sam Adams Triple Bock, but then I opened one of those and noted the differences. Still, this is rich, flavorful, tasty, but STRONG. Its not playing. Treat with respect and enjoy. Recommended. Thanks to Pegasus for sharing the bottle."
"D - This beer is everything that bourbon wishes it could be. Sessionable? That's a stupid question, one of these and I'm very drunk already. But this is definitely a dessert beer. This 12 oz bottle cost me $6 (on sale), I am strongly contemplating buying a few other bottles before this sale ends. I bet this would store extremely well. I think this is my new favorite barleywine. I can't believe that it is rated ""so low"" (compared to other barleywines). This is one of my favorite beers. In fact one bottle is almost too much."
"Overall, it was definitely interesting. Way overboard on the sweetness, which I normally hate but this was surprisingly not that bad. I found myself freely sipping it rather than forcing it down which I normally do with the sweet beers."
"You must drink this beer! An all-time Top 10 beer."
"Drinkability: This is a very thick beer to drink. Frankly all I could do was sip the beer. This would probably be an alright beer to split several ways. Almost to much for one beer drinker to finish."
"The body is thick, syrupy and very puckery. Not very good. Disgustingly sweet and vinegary, and coats to the mouth. Pretty much everybody I sampled this beer with ended up pouring out most of it (and I sampled it with two independent groups of people)."
"Drinkability A very odd beer, a cool bottle, but maybe not balanced at all, which in this case, makes for a beer that isn't one of my favorites (Reminds me of sme Ginger Wine I had a while back). Still, I am glad to have sampled it. Thanks to LuckySevens82."
"Been a member of this site for a while but this was the first beer that I had to vote on. May be the best beer I've had and I've had thousands of them. Similar taste to Samichlaus except even better (which I didn't think possible). Incredibly smooth going down for 14.5% alcohol. Would love to see how this ages in the bottle. A must try beer for anybody."
"12 oz bottle from 2005 poured into a snifter, this is a beautiful glowing amber with great ruby highlights, a thin spotty head as expected, and some very nice spidery lacing left behind on the glass. Nose is very sweet, somewhat like vanilla, with a fairly assertive bourbonlike alcohol note. Taste is also more sweetness, thick syrupy molasses-like, with nice flavors of oak, vanilla, almond, some slight fruit and a slight bourbony finish. Very nice and flavorful, borderline cloying on the sweetness, but never quite getting too much. For how high octane and sweet it is, this really is amazingly drinkable. I just sipped it alone, but it would also go great with some cheese or even desert."
"12 ouncer ""bottled in 2005", with a red foil covering and nice looking art on the label. Pours a farily dull shade of almond, that upon close inspections reveals a fruity fruity dark melon hue, the puffy head noisily shrinks to a thin film and leaves some spotty and fine lacing. Nose here is of some fresh fruits and then mostly fusil alcohol and some paint thinner/varnish type of odor. This stuff smells strong! I consumed this at about room temperature. Very flavorful and obviously stong beer. Notes of vanilla, sherry, port, oak, leather, minty freshness and glowing, warming alcohol. Wow, what a brew. This will be over the top for many, and too sweet for others, but I found it to be a potent late night sipper, would be fine with some stinky cheese, pepperoni, nuts, dark bread or with a decadent dessert. I'm sure this would be amazing after 3-5 years of careful, temperature and light controlled aging. If youve got that type of patience. Strong beer lovers-Go get some and enjoy!"
"A very special treat."
"Notes: Like I said, the flavors and aromas here don't seem off, but the beer it too syrupy in mouthfeel. Where did all the sugar come from if this finished at 14%? I don't believe I'll be buying this one again."
"I think this is a dangerously drinkable brew. Especially at 14.5%. I woill pick this up again. It would be a great beer to add to the beer the beer cellar."
"Drinkability is good as long as you consider this is closer to a good sipping bourban rather than a quick drinking beer."

"Poured into a Rapscallion glass, formed a 1/8"" light tan head above the clear orangey copper brew. Head is gone in a flash, with minimal lacing, both of which are not uncommon for the style, especially barrel-aged. Aroma is dominantly of alcohol, with some oaky vanilla notes. Taste is almost excruciatingly sweet malt, with potent dark fruitiness, all ending with a reasonably strong alcohol presence, but not as much as the nose indicated. Mouthfeel is a bit harsh for the style, and drinkability is also a bit tough, what with the strong alcohol and high sweetness. Overall, though, an interesting brew."
"from the bottle. poured a orange amber, with a off white head. aroma caramel, fruity, woody, hopds. yeast, sugar,, alcohol. flavor the first thing I got was the alcohol a nice smooth alcohol, than out jumped the caramel, honey, fruit and a nice touch of hops. not too bad"
"coppery amber colored with very little head when poured, it fades to the faintes of rings around the sides of the glass. apple, caramel, smoky oak notes, honey, alcohol, black ripe cherry, sweet bourbon characteristics, vanilla, and citrus all play roles in the aroma in varying degrees throughout the duration of this beer. it's very hard to put them in any sort of descending order so the preceeding list shouldn't be read as such. the taste consists of rich caramel, vanilla, brown sugar, some almost peach like fruit flavors with the apple and cherries form the nose, oak flavors begin at the back of the mouth and continue as an aftertaste that mingles with the fruit flavors. hints of bourbon come with the spicy alcohol that grows as the beer warms. i notice there are some very meade like characteristics to this beer including the mouthfeel which is very thick, but more carbonated than the appearance would let on. the drinkability is quite good considering the strength of flavor, full body and high abv. a very impressive brew from avery. i'm gonna try to pick of a few more of these for aging if i come across any."
"That said, it can be tackled in successive sips, and thus distances itself from Avery's other high proof ventures. Diabetics and other sweet-aversive people beware."
"thanks Gabe for sharing"
"Drinkability: Dangerously drinkable given the ABV. It takes a lot to impress me with a barleywine. They have the potential to be a mess of alcohol and malt sweetness. Not this one. This is a sweeter one but well balanced and very enjoyable. Nice job by Avery."
"Pours a clear copper color with virtually no head or lace. Nose is a blend of vanilla, apple, caramel and a definitive brandy finish. Taste has a lot of candy sweetness up front, followed by vanilla and some mild bourbon heat. Not as much alcohol heat as I expected (this is good). More candy sweetness on the finish. Nice, sweet, port type brandywine. It could use a little hop character. The mouth feel is very smooth. Decent drinakbility tempered by the sweetness."
"Comments - Split a 12 ounce bottle with a friend or two."
"Opinion: Well, another fine and over the top offering from our friends at Avery. I bought a couple extra of these to try in a couple years, as I think that this will be about the time that the beer may BEGIN to reach its prime. It is flavorful now, but this beer should be phenomenal after aging some."
"this beer had a lot of character to it. It was thick and left a lingering taste that resembles nuts. It was full of body and went down fairly easily. So far it is one of my favorite barley wines, though I can only compare it to a few. The depth of this beer was unlike the beer that I usually drink. I usually prefer a lighter body beer, but this one seemed to hit the spot."
"12oz bottle served in a Kentucky Bourbon Barrel Ale snifter. Body is a slightly hazed, copper amber color with a small beige head that quickly disappears without lacing. Aroma is fusel and phenolic, with aggressive notes of brandy and bourbon. Cotton candy notes from the turbanado sugars. Overripe peaches and apricots, drenched in brandy. A mild accent of vanilla, and just a hint of char and oak. Mouthfeel has a medium body and low carbonation. Warming alcohol is inescapable. Taste has sweet vinous notes and an assertive alcohol warmth. Nice array of fruits, with baked raisins, stewed apples, and overripe apricots. Some apricot nectar infused with sherry. Huge and powerful, and intended to be so. Nothing subtle here. Very over the top, but not overwrought like the 2004 Beast. Quite drinkable, actually, but watch your step. Avery made a wise move by releasing this in the smaller bottles. A bomber of this would be a bit too heavy for just one person. Thick and syrupy, and big alcohol with a solid fruit component await you here. This is the ""Mini Beast""."
"12 ounce bottle, thanks mentor!"
"Clear light orange to amber hue, limited head. Sweet highly phenolic and ethanol fuel nose. Heavy licorice and cane sugar essences, greenish young oak feels rough around the edges. Extreme level of sweetness, chocolatey and brown sugar in a most concentrated way. Strong oaky alcohol presence, little burn grapsing the tongue. Limited goldings presence, vegetal finish, gently hoppy, but not enough to provide anything resembling balance. Rather heavy carbonation, syrupy palate, not cloying, but agressively sweet. Still, there are some rather pleasant flavors in there. I would not count on it, but maybe it is even that with some age, this would become palatable."
"Drinkability and Notes  This is a solid sipping beer, complex, but not exactly drinkable. Worth a try particularly if you like big English Barley Wines. I wish they would drop the alcohol to raise the drinkability and hop a bit more liberally to better balance out the near cloying sweetness."
"To enjoy this beer it must be on intermittent occasions and most certainly on a cool night. Drinking it slowly over about an hour had a very decent effect of being both enjoyable and not too over-powering."
"Very thick, tongue coating, sticky mouthfeel. Sip by sip, as I tried to get the beer down, the warming effects go stronger and stronger. As a strong nightcap, a very good drink. Not suited for any other purpose."
"When is enough enough? Smell like scotch whiskey, and tastes like scotch whiskey. Hell, it must be scotch whiskey. It all tasted fine. My score relect that. I think everybody should try it. With that being said, Samaels doesnt really have many characteristics of a beer.."
"Poured a rich deep burnt orange with a white one finger head that clings nicely to the glass,seems to be quite highly carbonated.Big vanilla bean aromas go well with the underlying oak almost a spiced rum feel on the nose.Chewey thick mouthfeel but it glides nicely down the hatch coating the mouth nicely just sublime,flavors like aroma are heavy on vanilla but there is dried fruit flavor as well like prunes and or raisins.This a sipper but is exceptional when sipped another big winner from Avery."
"Beer iz good. Happy behind-an-airport dumpster-toothless-crack whore-style American Barely Wine Beering, ma' beeyatches."
"Drinkability is good as in it is very tasty, wouldn't ever want more then two guess thats why its in 12oz instead of Avery's usual 22ozer's that or lower the sticker shock a little. Wouldn't mind having a few to cellar hopefully they will make it near me soon. Want to offer many thanks and karma to movingshadow152 for sending me this gem."
"D- All I could do was take little sips ... very heavy on the palate. A 12oz bottle could be split among two or three people as an after dinner drink."
"Wow, there is a whole lot of something going on in this beer. At 14.5% Alc you would expect a big alchol bite but it is smooth and sweet. A nice deep dark brown color. Let this beer warm up a little bit and it is simply wonderful. I bought a few bottles for my beer 'cellar' and will let them age for a few years. This one is a keeper."
"Big and bold and sweet.... stunning! Definitely unique, and surprisingly enjoyable for such a sweet-malt and alcohol monster!"
"This is a big ass beer, not session material, but a good sipper. It will be interesting to try this one after a year in the cellar."
"This beer is a brilliantly clear, copper-amber color and, despite a fair amount of carbonation, only has a wispy thin tan head. The aroma is thick and concentrated with notes of port, brandy, alcohol, cherries, cinnamon and sundry other spicy notes, and a hint of buttery-vanilla oak. The beer is quite sweet and fruity, I get notes of cherries and tart grapes, very much in a brandy sort of fashion. The oak is quite subtle, and hits with a hint of buttery, tannic wood in the finish; what a great use of oak, it really is playing a minor supporting role here, just like it should. This is a lot more drinkable than I was expecting, it is certainly a sipper though, as it is quite thick and viscous. But it is pretty tasty for a high octane brew, and is infinitely more refined than the beast. There is a certain amount of hot alcohol in the finish but it is held in check by the fruity sweet notes that dominate this beer. This beer is really quite sweet, though the stickiness is held in check by the high alcohol, which helps to reduce the viscosity."
"Yowza this stuff is not for the faint of heart. Pours a ruddy orange-red color with a medium thin beige head and thin lacing. Huge malt and caramel aroma. Rich and chewy body and insanely sweet. This is definitely a sipper. Malt, caramel, maple syrup flavors along with a sweet sherry taste. The finish is long and sweet and is really the only place I noticed any oak. $8 or so for a 12oz bottle and I am pretty sure I would never want more than one in a sitting. This stuff will put hair on your chest."
"Thsi beer pours a brilliat amber color with a light coat of head over top. Appearance is rather still. The nose is pretty darn nice. It bursts with cherry sweetness. The alcohol is very apparent in the nose as well. Man. It seems that there is a bit more going on in there, but I can't describe it. A great sweetness and a pretty apparent alcohol. I really do like it. I actually can't stop smelling this one. Time for a taste. I get big caramel and brown sugary sweetness along with the sweet cherry...reminds me of a sherry I had recently almost. Things fade to very light woody tanin on the finish. Really just a hint of the alcohol in the middle, but not offensive. Very nice; maybe a touch too sweet. The feel is thick and syrupy. It doesn't stick and oat too much, but hangs just long enough. Man. Good brew. I really like the nose and flavor. The feel is good and the overall drinkability is pretty damn impressive for 14%. Wow. I am not sure I can wait on my bottle to age, though I think it will even get better with 6-12 months."
"Pours an amber color with no head and doesn't leave any lacing on the glass, but has some active carbonation. The aroma reminds me of alcohol soaked cherries, vanilla, oak, and a lot of sweetness. Smells very nice. The flavor is excellent. Tons of cherry goodness in the taste. The alcohol strangely doesn't make itself known until the warming effect sets in. Very little alcohol in the flavor. Very smooth. The body is on the thick end of moderate and it is supremely drinkable for the alcohol. This is a very dangerous beer. This has to be my favorite Avery beer I've ever had, and they are one of my favorite breweries."
"Holy hell, I need more of this."
"This beer poured a clear dark red amber color and formed an off white bubbly head that disapated quickly leaving trace lace. A wonderful aroma of changing smells of caramel, malt, oak, plum, and others unknown. A flavor of malt, caramel and candy with sherry elements (fairly sweet). It was a medium, creamy body with a sweet finish that hinted at the alcohol present. Would probably improve with aging."
"The beer decamps the 12-ounce brown bottle a reddish-brown with a modest semi-creamy light tan head that disappears rather quickly leaving a fine covering of lace upon the glass. Nose is sweet and sour, hints of Oak, caramel, malt, and of course, a bit of fusel alcohol, a pleasant sniff for sure, start is quite sweet, the malt profile pleasant, the top moderate in feel. Finish has a stern acidity with a nice hop spiciness, quite dry and slightly tart aftertaste and yes, a bit of alcohol bitterness, certainly a belly warmer, but at 14.5 percent alcohol, not as brutal as The Beast, and I am sure it will age gracefully."
"I wouldn't say don't try it, just beware the flavors and be ready to share."
"The bottle for this one is really, really cool, and for something that could age for ages (this was bottled in 2005) this was really smooth while very young. I mean to pick up a couple bottles for the sake of aging and comparing."
