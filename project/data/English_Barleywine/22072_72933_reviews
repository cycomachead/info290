"Overwhelming smell of whiskey, but the taste is much more acceptable."

"I don't consider myself a fan of the barley wine but this is the 1st in the revolution deep woods collection I thought was good! Not nearly as delicious as bourbon county barley wine. This is one worth the deep woods price point. Smells sweeter than it taste. Has a beautiful Amber hue color.  Must acquire another 4 the collection"

"All of those caramelized bourbon oak flavors come out strong on this beer, and everything locks in.  This is an outstanding barleywine."
""
""
""
"Pretty hot, needs some time to age."
""
"Smell doesn't do the taste justice. Malty, syrupy, oily, with a lot of oak and overly ripe raisins. Boozyness hits hard and quick. Comes in bomber size, I reccomend sharing. Very much a special occasion beer."

"Got in a trade with TheFugitive. 22 ounce bottle into snifter bottled on 1/17/2014. Pours hazy dark ruby red color with a 1 finger dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty lacing clings on the glass with some light streaming carbonation. Aromas of raisin, plum, fig, date, caramel, toffee, toast, brown sugar, vanilla, coconut, bourbon, oak, and toast/oaky earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark malt, bourbon barrel, and dark fruit notes; with good strength. Taste of big raisin, plum, fig, date, caramel, toffee, toast, brown sugar, vanilla, coconut, bourbon, oak, and toast/oaky earthiness. Slight tannic oak bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of raisin, plum, fig, date, caramel, toffee, toast, brown sugar, vanilla, coconut, bourbon, and oak on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity and robustness of dark malt, bourbon barrel, and dark fruit flavors; with a great malt/barrel balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Light carbonation and fairly full bodied; with a very creamy, fairly slick, and slightly tannic mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is an awesome barrel aged English barelywine style. All around great complexity, robustness, and balance of dark malt, bourbon barrel, and dark fruit flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the huge ABV. A highly enjoyable offering."
"I really liked this beer."

"The flavor starts smooth and sweet with caramel and toffee. The middle tends more to maple syrup, molasses and brown sugar. It ends with a literal barley wine ie, barley malt and fermented grape flavor. All the while it serves smooth and thick and masks the 13% very nicely."

"Picked this up from a great trade with Evan!  Beautiful mahogany-red pour with a one finger beige head that quickly fades with decent lacing.  The nose is bold and oaky with huge vanilla and sweet caramel malt along with hints of bourbon, dark fruit, toffee, brown sugar, and subtle white pepper.  The taste is even bolder with huge oaky barrel notes along with hints of vanilla, bourbon, dark fruits, molasses, coconut, brown sugar, caramel, subtle cocoa, white pepper, and raisins.  The mouthfeel is thick and syrupy with light carbonation, incredible balance, and a nice smooth, warming finish.  Overall, this a bold, flavorful, and hugely drinkable Barley Wine that is right up there with all my favorites in the style.  Highly recommended!"

"Bottle (this is Straight Jacket) from trade. Pours dark amber with lots of reddish color and a beautiful creamy two finger off white or khaki head. Aroma is lots of fruits, figs, toffee, caramel, vanilla, oak, bourbon. Flavor is sweet rich caramel covered figs with brown sugar, vanilla, tinged of dry oak. The bourbon is here but oh so smooth with very little evidence of the 13% ABV. Silky smooth and thick, rich body with low plus carbonation. Man, this is really good. And apparently my trade partner grabbed it off the shelf? More please!"

"O- A fine example of how the bourbon barrel aging process should go down.  The nose is near flawless, the flavor is as complex as my last cardiopulmonolgy exam, and the body is just so damn smooth.  My first from Revolution and most certainly not my last. 4.45"

"O: Maybe a little heavy on the wood aspect, but with such a heavy-malt brew it works well. For a barleywine, this is nicely complex and appropriately alcohol-ed."
"Revolution's beers do not disappoint me and I believe this is one of their best offerings. To me it has all of the characteristics needed in an English BW and isn't that far behind the very best of them such as Sucaba and BCBBW. it is a notch or two below just because of depth (lack therof) of flavor/ taste. It's more expensive than Sucaba per bottle, also, which is somewhat frustrating."

"Overall - Good, but not really my style. A bit too sweet and hot for my tastes. Can't shake the thought that this tastes like a 'hard cola'. Only other BA Barleywine I've had was the FW Sucaba... hard to say that I'd prefer one to the other, and truth is I'd probably rather have a well crafted BW to a BABW any day of the week."

"Straight Jacket pours a dark amber brown, with today's sunshine bringing out some intense red notes. Head is light and soapy and stays in place around the ring of the glass. Aromas are intense and excellent: burnt caramel, oaked dark fruit, and lots of booze. Going in for a sniff never gets old. Taste is sticky sweet vanilla butterscotch and oaked dates. Some nice char and light hops that work against the (very pleasant) sweetness. Mouthfeel was just right: on the lighter/thinner side, but substantial enough to coat the palate. Overall, I could pound this one all night. So rich and tasty. From the taste I would've thought this was an English barley wine, but can see it as a milder Central Waters BA barley wine (in terms of that tart happiness I like in the American style). Ideal drinking environment is dead of winter, next to a fireplace. But a sunny porch on a 65 degree late afternoon will do."

"The beer pours a slightly murky chestnut brown with no sediment and a thin head of fine carbonation that falls off quickly with light lacing. The nose is a mix of molasses, raisin, bourbony oak that finishes with a hint of ethanol and vanilla as it warms. Similarly, the taste is sticky bourbon barrel goodness - bready malts, well integrated bourbon notes, minimal bitterness/hop character, and lingering caramel. The mouthfeel is impressively drinkable with a medium-full, slightly flat body, rich bourbon flavors, lingering caramel sweetness, minimal bitterness, and a smooth, non-burning boozy finish. This is definitely an impressive BA barleywine, made that much better by its shelf status and availability."

"Man, I wish carbonation had made even a cameo here. The heaviness & flatness really dulls the flavors & washes out what I suspect is an awesome beer. As is? Merely decent."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"It is a rich brown color that pours quietly yet gives a small head top. As you smell it you quickly notice a hint of what you may think is a softer bourbon which makes it very unique. The taste that follows is remarkably smooth, complex and a special blend of brew!!"

"O: Overall this is a superlative barley wine and bourbon barrel aged beer. This beer is very underrated in my opinion. I've had some good barley wines recently and Straight Jacket beats Sucaba, and Behemoth. More comparable to this years Bourbon County Brand Barley Wine. I would highly recommend grabbing a bomber! I can only imagine it gets better with age."
""
""
"O- this is a very good brew. The taste is sooo good. I think it would taste even better with age. I really enjoyed this."

"Overall: I thoroughly enjoy this beer. A good barrel-aged barleywine. I love finish of this beer as mentioned. I do not remember ever tasting that particular characteristic as strong in other barrel aged beers. Maybe I will get another bottle to age."
""
""
"Reall glad I have a bottle to age, this will do great things I'm sure."

"Overall - it's a REALLY strong brew. A well executed beer with some great potential. I think the grain bill and mix will yield a well developed barrel aged barely wine in another year or so. Hold on to this one, with age will come promise. And this beer has promise AND the ability to follow through in the future..."
""
"Overall - Very tasty. Great barrel. Everything works well here."
""
"OVERALL: A solid brew for sure. This was definitely my favorite of the four Revolution brews I sampled recently, as it was very flavorful, well balanced and had a full, creamy feel to support everything that was going on. Something I would gladly drink again. Cheers again for the stuff Masterski. Recommended."
""
""
"Pours a hazy orange-brown with a foamy tan head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Tiny dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, brown sugar, caramel, toffee, wood, and bourbon aromas. Taste is much the same with brown sugar, toffee, and bourbon flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of woody and hop bitterness and an alcohol kick on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good beer with great bourbon aromas and tasty flavors."
""
"Overall - this is a top notch barleywine and BA beer in my book. I haven't had it fresh, but I must say with a year on it, it was outstanding. Definitely going to seek out a bottle when it's released next (I'd expect in Jan. hopefully) I wanted to savor this but it was so enjoyable I think I drank it too fast without enough to enjoy!"

"O - I'm a fan, not sure if laying it down for almost a year helped or not. But, I love BBA beers and this fits the bill."

"O) One of the best Bourbon Barrel beers I have ever had, perfect amounts of sweetness and flavor all around a great beer. Lots of flavor and worth the price."
""
""
""

"A very good barrel aged barleywine. This bottle had almost one year on it which may have mellowed it. The flavors are great and captures the essence of barrel aging."
"would definite get again great beer"

"This poured as a very nice clear brown color, there is a thin white hea on top also. The retention is thin, just a ring around the edge of the glass. Not much lacing. The smell is sweet and very malty, some bourbon and hops in there as well. The taste is sweet with loaded of malt, caramel, maple and oak. The mouthfeel is syrupy, gently carbonated a slick. Overall it's a very nice barley wine, the barrel aging isn't over the top but still very good."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Woah... even bigger on the palate. The big malt/bourbon sweetness hits first, then the heat surfaces, then a dry and sticky finish. The booze-soaked oak is pretty much a theme through and through. Honestly, this one tastes even boozier than 13%. Are they just saying that in order to appease those pussies in Ohio?"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Lovely. Bourbon is extraordinary, frothy level was great, aged fruits were outstanding- real complex. only knock maybe be a bit sweet for some palates and I wish it was just a touch thicker, but thats just me."
""
""
"M: It's not super think, but is a full bodied boozy beer."

"(O)- This is a great barrel aged barleywine. It actually might lean more towards the english style than american for me, but with having this and very mad cow by revolution, I am becoming a believer in their deep wood series. Very well balanced and also incredibly drinkable for the style."
""
"M - Medium to full body but a touch thin at times. Light carbonation."

"12/06/12 bottle date. Thanks to an awesome BA for sending me this one. Pours a hazy, amber-red color with a small white head that disappears quickly. Scent is not much to write home about...gonna let it warm up a bit... Okay, I've let it warm up long enough. There is some faint whiskey aroma coming through with nice vanilla notes. Some nice dark fruit aromas. Taste is much more forward than the nose. Initially, great booziness. I'm not gonna lie, I love my BA beers to have some booziness, and this one has it. Nice warmth. Boozy whiskey up front with some vanilla and dark fruit flavors. I'm not positive what kinda barrels this beer was aged in, but you can tell they weren't ""top of the line""... which is okay by me. I'm always good for a nice beer aged in Jack barrels or something. There are some definite rye flavors coming in as I taste it more. Was this beer aged in rye whiskey barrels? I should have done my research. Mouthfeel is perfect for the style. Drinkability is fairly high...somewhat scary. Overall, this beer is very unique. I'm getting a lot of rye flavors and this is a barleywine. I'm only used to rye BA stouts and whatnot. Very tasty beer!"
""
"O: Very good. I was pretty impressed. The heat is up there but it was not overly hot. I could drink this all day long!"
""
""
""
""
"Pours with a decent amount of head and an amber color. This one has a good balance between sweeter flavors and hop bitterness. The smell is very strong and full of malt and bourbon heat. I'm getting some caramel and vanilla notes. The hops lighten up the sweetness a bit. This is pretty easy to drink."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I personally would put call this more of an English Barleywine. Either way, this was a well-balanced, slightly sweet barleywine that I was glad to try."
"o - Overall I thought this was a great BA barleywine; it reminded me of a slightly better, less boozey Bolt Cutter. Loads of vanilla and caramel mixing with whiskey, I liked it a lot. If you like whiskey/beers that are a little bit hot or you like Bolt Cutter I would definitely try to get this one; would love to have it again."
""
"I am satisfied with this rarity and my customers have all been delighted in their acceptance of this totally unique brew."
""
""
"O: A great tasting barleywine, heavy on the barrel. More carbonation would help the mouthfeel, but besides that this is very good."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- good BA Barleywine. Not a top 10 Barleywine but falls in line shortly after."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Delicious. Incredibly smooth with a well integrated barrel. There is a slight touch of heat, but nothing out of line considering the 13% ABV. Slightly sweet upfront, but overall it is very pretty balanced."
""
""
""
""
"This is the first I've had from Revolution as far as their BA offerings, and I am impressed. A great example of a BA American Barleywine."
""
""
""
"Another situation where I haven't tried the base beer, but am nonetheless undeterred from ticking the barreled version. Oh yeah. This stuff pours a murky garnet topped by a half-finger of wan khaki foam. The nose comprises toasted toffee, whiskey, light toasted oak, light cocoa, and candied orange peel. The taste brings in more of the same, along with some light ruby red grapefruit rind and a slightly boozy kick. The body is a hefty medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a drying finish. Overall, a pretty enjoyable barrel-aged barleywine. It may not be especially crazy or anything, but I'd definitely have another, no hesitation."

"Appears a clear burnt orange with layer of tan head, nice retention. Nose starts with big bourbon wave, vanilla, molasses and oak come through. Taste is smooth with an assertive sweet malt profile. Smooth vanilla, toffee, caramel, and marshmallow. A bit of leather and earth finish things off. Smooth mouthfeel, medium carbonation. Overall, the barrel really smooths things out and makes this quite a bit more exciting."
"O - An improvement over the base beer, but I'm not a big fan of that to begin with. Pretty forgettable when it comes to BA Barleywine, but overall not too bad."
""
""
""
"O: A very nice BABW. The flavors blend play well together and I'm glad the barrel aging wasn't overdone. Fairly sweet with lots of vanilla. If there ever was a dessert beer, this would be it."
"Wonderful complexity. Richness of flavors play very well together. It's dark murky (almost mud-like) appearance as it cascades in the snifter doesn't do much to make you want to dive right in, and perhaps you shouldn't. This gentle monster improves dramatically as you allow it to warm from serving tank temperature. Refreshing maltiness for a big barleywine. A pleasant departure from the common ""Hop the snot out of it"" approach to the style. Though I love this beer for it's flavor and complexity, it's drinkability that sets it apart from every other 13%er around. Pound for pound, the easiest drinking big beer in town. Certainly a favorite."
"O: This was a rare 13%er that didn't wear out our tongues. Dangerously easy to drink. Excellent effort in their BA program."
"Feel is sticky, flavors of sweet caramel, vanilla, and toffee flavors dominate. Sweet lingering finish, vanilla from the wood, but not especially boozy. The alcohol does seem to dry out the palate after the sweetness passes. The distinctive dried cherry notes of the base beer have been obliterated by the barrel it seems. Overall this is good, and potent in small doses. Wouldn't want more than one, and then only for dessert."
"O - One of the more fatiguing beers I've had in a while. So sweet I was ready to call it quits after an ounce, literally. Not that it tastes bad, just way too powerfully sweet and rich. I forced my way through 5 ounces but was rough. Not getting this again at the price."
"D - A decent barrel-aged barleywine, but one of Revolutions weaker offerings. I didn't feel the need to order a whole glass of this one. I think I preferred Haymarket's stab at this style to be honest, although it suffered from excessive booze. Wooden Hell, BA Behemoth, and BA Hi-Fi Rye are safe on the podium for the moment."
