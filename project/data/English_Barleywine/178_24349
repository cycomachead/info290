Taste is sweet caramel malt, yeast, dark fruit, figs, brown sugar with some barrel aged woody and calvados notes and mild bitterness. A medium bodied. smooth and slightly creamy mouth feel on the palate with light carbonation. Finished with a sweet caramel malt, dark fruits, figs, brown sugar, ending has a lingering sweet caramel, figs and aged woody flavor.

Minimal lacing on the glass. Aromas of big raisin, apple, fig, prune, caramel, toast, toffee, molasses, light pepper, brown bread, brandy, vanilla, oak, and toasted earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of malt, cask, and fruity notes; with good strength. Taste of big raisin, apple, fig, caramel, toast, toffee, brown sugar, brandy, brown bread, vanilla, oak, light pepper, and toasted earthiness. Lingering notes of raisin, apple, fig, caramel, toast, toffee, brown sugar, brandy, oak, vanilla, light pepper, brown bread, and toasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Fantastic balance and complexity of malt, cask, and fruity flavors; with zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Minimal carbonation and fairly full bodied; with a very slick, creamy, and lightly syrupy mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a really excellent English barelywine style. Great balance and complexity of malt and cask flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the ABV. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Sep 16, 2013"

4.05,0,2.5,4.25,4.25,3.75,4,"Bottle that says ""Brewed in 2006."" Pours brownish reddish toffee color with no head and lots of sediment floating around. Aroma of biscuits, toffee, caramel, vanilla, licorice, some chocolate. Nice. Flavor is sweet up front like whoah, then fades into an intense praline nuttiness and vanilla cream. The nutty flavor lingers a good while and is very pleasant--probably the best part of this beer. The up front super cloying maple sweet makes it tough to drink at start, but otherwise a nicely layered bunch of flavors. Brown sugar, figs, and chocolate begin to show. Calvados and butterscotch come out as it warms. Thick and viscous. Heavy, decadent dessert beer for sure. Maybe a bit much, but definitely had the depth of flavor. The palate improves as I go, and overall one to try for barleywine lovers. One of the most complex flavor profiles I have come across since BB4D.","BMMillsy","Beers"

Flavor is caramel, intense apple juice, dark dried fruit, hint of vanilla. Quite sweet, but the intensity of flavor makes this very drinkable. Medium to heavy bodied, just short of syrupy.

Bottle has aged well, getting just the slightest touch of oxidation. Mouthfeel is sticky and sweet, quite smooth, with a medium-full body and low carbonation. Overall a very nice treatment of J.W.

It smells of a weird mixture of baby aspirin, apple juice and sherry. The taste is surprising. It's syrupy sweet with a soft smokey oak flavor with a definite sherry backnote. Aftertaste is like smoked cotton candy. The mouthfeel is rich and fizzy with slight carbonation. Alcohol is present but completely befuddling and un-noticeable (therefore dangerous). It's the weirdest barleywine and one of the strangest beers i've ever tried. I think I like it, I think. I'm not sure.

The flavor is nicer, a bit syrupy without the carbonation, but there is a nice floral blend of apple and some wood and malt in the background. The alcohol is very well hidden and it is very smooth. Definitely a sipper because of the sweetness and body. I don't know if the sweetness comes from the base beer or the calvados, either way it is close to being too much. Very heavy beer that is pretty much still. I do not expect a high level of carbonation in a beer like this, but some might have been nice to cut some of the sweetness.

A good amount of sediment slipped into my snifter and resembles clumps of cinnamon floating throughout my glass. It is very aromatic and gives of aromas of apples, caramel, oak, vanilla, cinnamon, nutmeg, and and maple syrup. The nose is phenomenal and heavy on the caramelized apples. The flavors given are of sweet apples, cinnamon sticks, oak, tree bark, vanilla, and caramel. It is very, very sweet and also quite syrupy. It drinks syrupy and medium in body and has almost lost all of its carbonation. Overall this beer is a sipper or to be shared and could be defined as a dessert beer at this stage in its life. It's a fine drinker and I prefer this to the Sherry Cask version. I'm glad I have another bottle to open again in another couple years. It's a good English Barleywine.","aasher","Jun 06, 2011"

4.1,1.2,4,4,4,4,4.5,"Lately anything Calvados related intrigues me. This version of JW Lees pours a really pretty rose color, with a quick to fade white head. The nose is very sweet, with lots of apples, alcohol, honeydew and peach nectar. The flavor follows the same example as far as sweetness, almost to the point of being cloying. While this is a boozy beer, the alcohol doesn't necessarily hinder the experience overall. Mouthfeel is a highlight here in that it is very smooth, and not too heavy. This is certainly a sipper, but a light one. While the ten dollar price tag is on the steep side for a bottle of its size, I recommend this beer. I paired some bitter Chimay cheese with it, which helped to cut down on the sweetness. I imagine the salty nature of Stilton would pair nicely as well.","jamie2dope","May 27, 2011"

Flavor is very sweet with caramel and toffee malt notes, oak, spice, calvados, and sherry-like oxidative notes. Slick on the mouthfeel with medium body and soft carbonation.

Poured a slightly hazy, dark caramel with clusters of tiny bubbles adhering to the glass. No head to speak of. Nose reveals boozy apple liqueur, sweet, malty, raisins, figs and maple syrup. Taste consistent with nose; however, apple quality is a bit masked by the syrup and figs. This is truly sweet and decadent. It's like drinking liquid fig newtons and maple syrup. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied, fairly still and a bit viscous. Wow, this is an amazing sipper, perhaps better served a little cooler so it could be allowed to warm, but a truly wonderful and warming experience. Can't wait to try more from J.W.

I feared that the apple might make the sweetness of the beer cloying, but it does he opposite. The apple character really only comes out as it would in a brandy with a rich complexity rather than an excessive apple bite and it combines wonderfully with the caramel notes inherent in the harvest beer. I can't say that I want a whole case of this, but it is an exceptional and unique beer and I am very happy to have had the chance to enjoy it.","nickfl","Oct 26, 2008"

Upon further investigation sweet plums, prunes and figs are noticed backed up by molasses, wood, a hint of caramel candy and booze. The taste experience begins with an initial medium bodied mouth feel that grows thick and viscous into the finish. The fluid ushers in some wood and malty sweetness first before the dark fruity esters take over with sugar coated plums, figs, prunes and stewed raisins. About midway the fruitiness becomes more sweet boysenberry like. The malts seem to go from the initial sugary malt sweetness to caramel candy, mildly roasted malts and then toward molasses and maple syrup. Toward the finish the wood, maple syrup and sweet caramel malts mix with a sense of booze. I get a lingering sense of all the flavors going deep into the after taste.

I think I'll be holding on to one of these for another 6 years to see if it improves as much.... I'll be curious to see how the cask flavors meld and hold up to the age.

3.1,-23.5,4,4,2.5,4,2.5,"11.5 % ABV, 2004 bottle. Pours a hazy chestnut color, with a thin off white head. The head disappears very quickly. Huge apple, pear, brandy, boozy aroma. Aroma really jumps right out of the glass. Sweet, syrupy and fruity flavor, with notes of apples, oranges and pears. Very thick and coating, with very little carbonation. Maybe a bit of caramel flavors at the end. A bit warming from the alcohol. Somehow this is smooth, but overly sweet. The sweetness was too much for me.","Bierguy5","Aug 13, 2006"
3.75,-7.4,4,4,3.5,4.5,3.5,"Brewed in 2005. Pours an orangish brown color with a thin white lacing on top. Aroma is sweet malt, caramel and alcohol. I can faintly pick up some apple in the nose as well. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy. Taste is sweet and brandy like with a warming boozy finish. The alcohol definately makes it's presence felt in this one. Overall, another good beer from J.W. Lees. Perhaps this was a bit too young, I will try to age one of these 2005's a bit and try again.","cjgator3","Aug 02, 2006"

4.64,14.6,4,5,5,4,4,"Pours the color of bright, homemade apple cider, with minimal head. Complex aroma of dark fruit (figs, raisins), molasses, candi sugar, bourbony vanilla, and a trace of candied apples. Huge on the palate. Spiced molasses to start with, then apple tartness combined with rich, figgy sweetness, followed by a vanilla crescendo. Giant malt sweetness is maintained throughout. The finish is long, hot with alcohol, and sweet. A very interesting English barleywine. It seems that the calvados treatment has diminished the coffee/bitter chocolate aromas/flavors of JW Lees Harvest, in favorite of a still-sweet, slightly tart fruitiness in line with a Calvados character. Very interesting brew.","geexploitation","Beers"

3.87,-4.4,4.5,5,3.5,3,3.5,"The initial taste was very sweet, almost sickening. The flavors that emerged were of plums, apple and walnut. The apple was expected as thats what Calavados is made from but the nutty flavor was unexpected and well received. In the end the initial sweetnes was a little too much to make this a favorite, however it is a great example of a different kind of oak aged beer with complex flavors.","nriech","May 18, 2006"
3.57,-11.9,3.5,4,3.5,4,3,"Much more subdued than it's lagavulin counterpart and in my opinion it's a good thing. At least 2% less RS than the lagavulin. Bigger caramel with a more complex malt component. Much more balanced and drinkable. No alcohol present in the mouth. Ends with a long smooth creamy mouthfeel. Yet still overly sweet, hence a less than stellar drinkability.","mcallister","May 09, 2006"
3.15,-22.2,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,2,"The taste was something else. Brandy-esque, sweet. Strong. Calvados. This wasn't horrible, didn't taste bad, but boy is this sucker a sipper. I shared, and we had to eventually take turns taking gulps to finish it- and by gulps I mean barely large sips. It just wouldn't end! It felt like it kept re-filling itself. Mouthfeel was kind of blah, watery, thin. I couldn't have too many of these- I couldn't finish ONE- I'd rather have a smaller portion, as a long, long nightcap.","scooter231","Apr 24, 2006"

3.73,-7.9,4,3.5,4,4.5,3,"Had this beer last night, 2004 vintage. I probably should have let it age, but then I wouldn't know how it changes. Anyway, served it in a tulip glass at cellarish temps. Looked beautiful in the glass, minimal head and bright amber color. Smelled strong of booze, malt and dark dark dried fruits. I caught raisins and some prune in there, i think. The boozey smell was a bit over powering. Taste was more of the same. Incredibly sweet, dark dried fruits, intense maltiness and a nice aged oak character. I have never had calvados, but I picked up a liquor character that must have been imparted by the cask. A bit too sweet for me, but otherwise excellent. It had a wonderful aftertaste that lingered pleasantly. The toasted oak and roasty malt flavors really came out in the aftertaste. I can only imagine that they would be more prevelant if the beer weren't so sweet. Mouthfeel was excellent, nice and chewy, just what an english barleywine should be. The drinkability suffered due to the alcohol presence and primarily due to the sweetness. I had trouble finishing the one 9 oz. bottle. All in all, it is a good beer, and if the sweetness diminishes with age it will become an excellent beer.","pfknapp","Mar 17, 2006"

3.2,-21,4,4,3,2,3,"Bright red color. Fairly aromatic, full of deep apple brandy, coconut and vanilla from the wood along with a light aromatic malt presence, with hints of fruits, brown sugar and caramel. The most aromatic of the Harvest cask ales, thus far. Lacking body however, like ever Harvest cask ale. Flavor is very, very sweet, more like a dessert beer and definately more of an after dinner beer. Light apple brandy flavors, caramel and fruit pie with well hidden alcohol. I think these beer need more time in the barrel, perhaps they would take on more depth and body.","Crosling","Mar 03, 2006"
4.34,7.2,3,4,4.5,5,4.5,"These experimental JW Lee Harvest Ales are pricey to pick up, but the flavour more than makes up for it.

Very sweet caramel flavor. There's definitely some influence from the Calvados cask. Dark fruit, like prunes. This beer may be thick, sweet, and almost flat, but it tastes so damn good, you hardly notice those things.

Tonight I was in particularly low spirits, and I figured it was time to hit something special. This was it. Perfect tasting beer beyond all aspects of what I know beer to be. My favorite beers are the over-the-top beers that can still be delicious, complex and balanced. And this one fits the bill perfectly. Some breweries go too far in ""pushing the envelope", but this one is a standard to which American brewers should look up to. Ale in it's perfect form.","santoslhalper","Aug 07, 2005"
3.81,-5.9,5,4,4,3.5,3,"Surprisingly close to Calvados in taste and character. This one is definitely a slow sipper that would be ideal in front of the fireplace on a cold winter night. Very warming. Interesting how a beer acquires the higher alcohol and flavors of the spirit that previously was aged in the same wooden cask. At a price of over $8.00 for this small bottle, I think I will pass on this one next time, though I'm likely to try the other cask aged Harvest Ales that Lees offers. For value, stick with their more pedestrian ales which have a higher drinkability and the same superb quality. The Calvados is so pervasive in this one that it renders it somewhat one dimensional.","merlin48","Jul 03, 2005"

4.12,1.7,4,4.5,4,4,4,"The beer pulls a Â“splitsvilleÂ” from the 275ml brown bottle and sets in my glass a deep orange-amber color with the head plentiful, the texture creamy and the color a splendiferous light tan, as its dissolves, the resultant lace a silky curtain to drape the glass. Nose has a nice malt presence, a bit of tartness, oak and a hint of caramel, start is decidedly sweet with a nice grain presence, the top is light to medium in feel. Finish is benign in its acidity, the hops overwhelmed by the sweetness and alcohol, quite dry almost vinous, and once again a beer that will age nicely, and a real belly warmer, got to love these beers.","Gusler","May 19, 2005"

The nose is malty with some wood and a mild vinous character (but that might just be the alcohol). It's creamy and smooth in the mouth with a restrained, fine-bubbled carbonation and full body. The flavor is intense, and it's almost too much to take in all at once. This is surely a sipper! Some apple from the Calvados does carry through (cold, it appears almost grape-like), but mainly it's the sweeter brandy (sugar/alcohol) that comes through. It finiishes surprisingly drying given the huge amount of sugar there, but its underlying bitterness and alcohol help with that. Very nicely done!","NeroFiddled","Jan 22, 2005"

ItÂ’s overall quite warming, but bears nowhere the charm of a regular JW Lees, has nowhere near the malt richness, depth. On the palate, it feels thick, buttery with a harsh syrupy apple juice component. Complex notes of honey, earth, peach and a much stronger bitterness than the non-barrel aged version. Medium carbonation level, full bodied, very sweet. Unmemorable, but perhaps the second best of the lot to me.","Rastacouere","Beers"
3.9,-3.7,4,4,4,4,3.5,"Pours a brilliantly clear full copper color, it is topped by a very thin pale head and is actually fairly well carbonated. The aroma is thick with alcohol as well as notes of thick chewy malt, and perhaps a hint of cidery apple in the finish. Actually the apple aroma slowly builds over time. This is a thick viscous brew, it is lightly sweet up front and almost light as it first hits the tip of my tongue. As it flows across my mouth it becomes quite full and thick. The apple notes from the calvados cask are certainly here, though they are a bit restrained, and really become full in the finish. This beer is quite malty as well, almost caramel-like in its malty sweetness. There is a certain soft butteriness to this beer, perhaps some hints of vanilla, and a soft hop bitterness in the finish, which helps to make the sweetness more palatable. This is a pretty tasty beer, though the Calvados casks are not overwhelming, and if I did not now in advance of it, I would have assumed that the apple notes were just a normal part of this beer.","Gueuzedude","0"

Slightly sweet malt aroma initially, quickly overpowered by alcohol notes. Taste is of sweet malts up front, then the alcohol takes over, seeming to evaporate in the back of your mouth, but in the nicest possible manner. Slight fruit tones, but they do not shine in comparison to the other two powerful aspects of this brew. Mouthfeel and drinkability are great for the style.

The taste is simply yummy. Warm and satisfying honeyed apples and malt. A bit of sweetness as it warms but that wasnt a bad thing. One can taste the Calvados in every sip. This was one of the most complex nightcaps I have ever had. Every sip I took I wished another was added to the glass. Drikability was good even with the high octane nature. It did sweeten as it got warmner, but hell. I might not be able to drink many of them but when my bottle was done I sure wish I had another for tomorrow night. Seriously one of the best barley wine I have ever had. Kinda reminded me of a more refined 120 min DFH. Or rather what DFH 120 will be if you let it sit for 5 years. Highly recommmended.

It has a bright amber body with a slight off white head that goes to bubbles shortly after leaving sparse lacing about the glass. The smell is rich and malty with lots of notes of fruit mainly apple being present. Taste reminds me of a caramel apple and alcohol with a slight smokiness to it. There is a lot of malt sweetness going on with this beer. Not much of a brandy drinker I could not specifically discern where the brandy had its effects. It finished smoothly and has quite the warming effect due to the 11.4% alcohol. Mouthfeel is sweet and creamy with good carbonation. This has fairly good drinkability a little less than the standard though. Overall a good beer that I would like to age and see how it turns out.
