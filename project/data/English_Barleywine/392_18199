4.03,-2.9,3.5,4.25,4,4,4,"perhaps as much oak on this beer as on any i have ever had. its really good, a lot better than it looks. almost milky super cloudy yeasty in the glass without much head at all. the smell is way more oak than bourbon, although i do get some vanilla notes and some sweetness. the grain is pretty straight forward, caramelized long boil sweet wort aromas, dried dates, english ale yeast. the flavor is a lot like the nose, just a little less intense ont the wood. the sweetness of the malt is much more pronounced, marshmallow and coconut notes come in, nutty for a second, but quite sweet, candy like for awhile, and then the wood. weird to think about drinking a solid object, like a tree trunk, but thats how this beer feels to me. its yeast too, but not overly so, it gets boozy as it warms, but i think this is pretty excellent barleywine. a great example of the style, and unique enough to stand out. thanks to thebrewo for leaving this one at my house!","StonedTrippin","Mar 27, 2015"

The aroma takes some time to open up, bringing out the deep malts and dark fruit notes and just a hint of vanillin. The body, though, brings the oak-aging upfront, backed up by the caramel and fruit sweetness. The oak isn't overwhelming, but it is the first thing I taste. The body has a nice thickness to it with a nice smooth finish.","delta490","Mar 19, 2015"

Plenty of the usual English barleywine characteristics, but none of the cloying, off-putting sweetness I found in Blithering Idiot. Its time in the barrel was well-spent, as the smokey wood, and slightly boozy heat add a layer of complexity that pairs perfectly with the rich malty backbone. It's a sipper for sure, and a damn good one. Can't wait to see what a year in the cellar does for this one.","glass_house","Mar 11, 2015"

4.05,-2.4,4,4,4,4,4.25,"Overall I thought this was a good beer and good example of the style, it had a lot of the aspects that I look for in an English style Barleywine and while I wish the oak showed up a little more, the aspects that did show up worked well with this beer and I enjoyed it.  This beer had ok drinkability, it was fairly smooth, the alcohol could have been hidden just a little better, a little crisp, sticky, a little warming, a little filling and the taste did a nice job at holding my attention, I think one is the perfect amount for me, anymore than that and I think the sweetness and booze would start to wear on me.  What I like the most about this beer this beer was how true to style it is, it's just what I expect from an English Barleywine.  What I like the least about this beer was that the that the oak barrels didn't show up just a little more.  I would buy this beer again and I would like to see how it changes overtime.  I would recommend trying this beer, especially if you like big and malty barleywines.  All in all I was pretty happy with this beer, I wasn't sure how this one was going to turn out, but I had high hopes and in the end it lived up to my expectations.  I think it's a good beer and I'm happy to be able to buy it now.  So far it's one of my favorite Weyerbacher beers and it's above average for the style.  Good job guys this is one tasty Barleywine, keep up the hard work.","StoutHunter","Mar 09, 2015"

Reminds me a lot of Duclaw Hell on Wood which was the last barrel aged barleywine i rremember enjoying quite a bit. It has the caramel malts, dark fruit, and bourbon characteristics as expected in this style. During the winter months this is a winner for sure. Some aging and i could see this being world class","Bone53","Jan 23, 2015"

Very well balanced with a pleasing dark fruit and bourbon/oak flavor. Smooth and very drinkable. Recommended as one doesn't see too many of this variety in 12 oz. bottles.","Donco","Jan 19, 2015"

You definitely taste the oak bourbon as well as malt, dark fruit like dates or prunes even and vanilla.  Lighter and thinner that you would expect.  Very smooth and mellow.  Aftertaste is very subtle but mainly malt and dark fruit with a hint of bourbon.  Just a hint though.  Really smooth.","uvachief","Jan 12, 2015"

Not being an especially huge fan of English-style barleywines, the bourbon barrel-aging adds a character that elevates an already proven beer to mythical heights. The appearance, complexities in both aroma and flavor as well as its silky mouthfeel culminate to make Insanity one intensely enjoyable drinking experiences. After reading, it should come as no surprise that my overall impression of Insanity is nearly perfect. Weyerbacher continues to impress and cannot wait until they release the next batch!

Beer is full-bodied and thick, not really sticky so it goes down smooth like velvet, there's some bourbon and woodiness in here so it's smooth and boozy.

Super smooth, sweet, fruity malt flavor. Again, the bourbon is prevalent, but not in a boozy way. Toffee, maple, sweet bread, and vinous fruit. A really delicious toasted note follows late with a lingering dried fruit quality. Oaky vanilla and tobacco. Quite sweet...definitely a sipper, but damn tasty.

The bartender told me it was a hoppy barleywine and he could not have been more wrong; this nose and flavor were both very malty, with oaky notes, yeast and more like a Belgian Strong Ale than a barleywine. There was some bourbon and caramel notes, but it was more malt and yeast than anything else. It was sweet with some heat that was not as bad as I thought it would be considering the ABV, but this did not go down easy or smooth. Mouthfeel was mdium to full bodied with mild carbonation and chewy feel, but as much as I wanted to like it this brew just let me down. I'll have to try it again from a bottle some time.","CHickman","Feb 06, 2014"

I’ve had this many times before and have loved the thick rich body, the malt sweetness with figs prunes and raisins, the oak and vanilla, the alcohol warming, everything, but on tap, there is a lot of this missing.

Pours cloudy deep ruby copper color with a small dense khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a thin lace cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with some light streaming carbonation. Aromas of big raisin, pear, apple, fig, caramel, clove, oak, pepper, molasses, toast, herbal, brown bread, toffee, light bourbon, and yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of malt notes with a fair amount of barrel presence; and good strength. Taste of big raisin, pear, apple, fig, caramel, molasses, toast, oak, clove, toffee, brown bread, bourbon, pepper, light vanilla, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Lingering notes of dark fruits, caramel, molasses, toast, clove, oak, toffee, brown bread, light bourbon, herbal, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a while. Fantastic balance and complexity of malt flavors; with moderate barrel presence and zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Light-medium carbonation and fairly full bodied; with a creamy, slick, and lightly syrupy mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with only a small warming present after the finish. Overall this is a fantastic barrel aged barleywine! All around awesome complexity and balance of malt and barrel flavors; and quite smooth to sip on for the big ABV. A highly enjoyable offering.","superspak","Oct 10, 2013"

Sweet with lots of malt sugar, toasted malt a little char in back and smooth vanilla. For how boozy it is it's plenty good. Alcohol is hot and warms from the nose to the last swallow. Stays hot in the aftertaste too. Body is thick and heavy. It's surprisingly delicious like a good sweet raisin bread that someone spiked.

Phenomenal caramel malts really shine without being sugary sweet as a result of the barrel aging, and the ABV, while certainly a noticeable component, isn't at all hot or overbearing. What a really amped-up barrel aged Imperial Scotch Ale would be like, and somewhat similar to a couple of my other barrel-aged favorites. This beer is a blue-ribbon winner and a must have when released, both for enjoying right away and laying down to see what some aging will do.","BuckeyeSlim","May 08, 2013"

3.95,-4.8,3.75,3.75,4,3.75,4.25,"12oz. bottle courtesy of newbrewbb. Served in an Allagash chalice. Pours a brownish-amber with a fizzy, half-inch, cream-colored head that sizzles and pops and dissipates into a tight band around the edges with some tiny dollops of foam across the surface. Quite a bit of effervescence is also present in solution but no lacing. Nose expresses a slight breadiness and dark fruit (plums or prunes maybe) as well as a bubblegum quality. Taste consistent with nose; however, there is also some ethanol as well as a slightly sugary quality and some toasted notes. Mouthfeel is medium-light in body with a prickly carbonation, a slightly oily texture and a mild burn at the finish that lingers between quaffs. Overall, an interesting beer that is closer to an American Strong Ale than an English Barleywine in my opinion. Fresh, this beer is a bit muddled. Not bad, but I think a little aging to dissipate the carbonation, mellow the heat and coalesce the flavors will do wonders for this beer. I don't really get any oak on this beer, other than perhaps the suggestion of some toasted notes in the flavor profile.","Jwale73","Feb 20, 2013"

Pleasant aroma of golden raisins, rich dates, toasted oak, vanilla, toffee, and balanced bourbon notes. Golden raisins, ripe plums, vanilla, dates and hints of fig, and finally caramel. Hints of toffee and almond and a bit of appleskin midpalate. Finishes with pleasant oakiness and vanilla and some bourbon. For 11% abv, the alcohol is very well integrated. Full bodied, syrupy and smooth, yet moderately carbonated. One of the better barrel-aged barelywines produced. This brew is a definitely one to add to the bucket list.","chanokokoro","Feb 14, 2013"

There are some cola type carbonation bubbles that migrate from the bottom of the glass to the surface of the beer, but once that fades, which is very quickly, this looks like a glass of ice tea. Vanilla, toffee, and some tart non-citrus fruit on the nose. Mouthfeel is pretty full and wet with a little carbonation sting on the back and edges of the tongue. I'm not sure I'd want much more carbonation than that with this beer. It warms your mouth right up. There's some tart cherry, some vanilla, and some sweet, buttery toffee. The flavors fade before the alcohol evaporates, so there's a bit of an off-putting alcohol flavor that lingers. It's a pretty good beer overall.

The nose is of sweet toffee, vanilla, cinammon spices a little woody as well. Carmelized vanilla bean immediately hits the palate and flows into a malty presence with cinnamon sticks, candied sugar and light oak with a touch of heat in the back. Very easy to drink, medium to full body with a subtle carbonation that compliments. Overall this was a stellar beer, the vanilla and oak balance play superb for each other with neither being too much. The hops are non existent so I'm not sure how this one is fresh where this bottle was a year old. Something to seek if given the opportunity.","JayAre46","Jul 07, 2012"

The nose has a simplistic sweetness that isn't very appealing to me. Tastes sweet and boozy with a huge preserved fruit presence. Brown sugar and caramel come out more toward the finish.

Color is an almost hazy brown amber with a single, meandering bubble trail. Flavor is hugely malt, sweet, caramel, vanilla, almost no bitter. Body reflects the flavors and so is round, full, and lush; thankfully with enough carbonic tang to balance. Finish is like flavor, of average to long in length and surprisingly mild.

A little bit of bourbon with some leather and maple syrup. Taste is very sweet at first with some brown sugar, dark fruits, and maple syrup. Then I get some nice, warming bourbon flavors. An interesting bitter hop profile to this as well. Pretty well balanced. Boozy finish. Mouthfeel is medium-full bodied, somewhat creamy, and warming. Drinkability is high. Overall, I think this is a very tasty brew. Not sure if I like it as much as Abacus (§ucaba), but I would love to do a side by side with the two.

The taste is marvelous with, again, caramel and vanilla being the highlights of the show. This is a sweet beer, and exactly what I like out of a BW.

An alcohol warmth in the back of the throat with each sip. This beer has a medium body and a low level of carbonation. Smooth and slightly sticky in the mouth.

It has a dark fruit profile reminiscents of J.W. Lee's harvest ale, but without as much flavor or depth as J.W. Lee's.

4.27,2.9,4,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,"Pours a hazy brown, so hazy in that it is nearly opaque save for the edges of the glass. A finger’s-breadth of foamy, cream-colored head rises and lingers for nearly a minute before settling down into a ring and a central patch of bubbles. Smells of toffee, hazelnut, caramel, oak, and faint dark fruit (raisin in particular). Tastes of toffee, oak, hazelnut, brown sugar, some raisin and date, and a faint touch of alcohol in the rear. As it warms, a vanilla presence becomes detectable, but the alcohol also makes itself more prominent. Mouthfeel is rich, but only medium in body as the carbonation and alcohol serve to thin it nicely. Finish is a touch dry. Overall, a great barleywine now and I have high hopes for the ones stashed away. I am very happy I was able to try this guy, and would recommend it to fans of the style.","eclipse54","Aug 15, 2011"

4.17,0.5,4,4.5,4.5,2.5,4,"Great flavor but it sits very heavy on the palate and stomach. Alcohol is well incorporated with the taste.

It pours a thick, hazy brownish color into my glass. A small head disappears fairly quickly. Man this smells great. I get some oak(natch), along with some malty caramel sweetness. The taste is very smooth, even though it's followed by a slight alcohol burn. Nice stuff. I really like Weyerbacher. Along with Victory and Troegs, PA has some awesome beers!

Strong sticky toffee flavor. Hints of dark fruits and some tart fruit flavor as well. As the beer warms, these initial flavors fade to the back and the beer is dominated by big cherry, vanilla and bourbon barrel notes.","uustal","Jul 14, 2011"
3.8,-8.4,4,4,3.5,4,4,"This beer poured in a snifter from on high generates a finger of head that dissipates rather quickly and leave a light ring around the glass. The color is a dark amber but not hazy or cloudy. Whoa Bourbon big time on the nose, it really smells like i put a 1/2 shot of bourbon in my barleywine (not that I've done that, lately). Maple and burnt sugar is lighter on the nose dominated by booze. The flavor is very light on the malt and hops, but the hoppy bitterness is present on the finish. Vanilla, charred wood (not smoke, but close) and honey. This is a very sweet beer, the overt syrupy sweetness and one note nose is keeping this beer from being a solid A. Alcohol is in check, but you know it's there with the heat and bitterness on the finish. Good beer, not great, but I'll enjoy my others.","wchollif","Jul 11, 2011"

Smells like sweet caramel malt, toffee, green apple, oak, bourbon, and some dark fruit (black currant). Taste is caramel, oak, bourbon, and a little chocolate and vanilla on the finish. I was expecting something sweeter from the smell, but this tastes pretty dry. The oak and bourbon are well integrated, the oak imparting some dry tannins.

Poured into my dfh snifter, pours a dark red/amber color, about 2 fingers of head, a little lacing remains on the glass. Smell- prunes, dates, sweet raisin, spices. There is a lot going on here, pretty complex. Taste- some alcohol heat, dark fruits (definitely the prunes, raisin, etc), some real sweetness to the dark fruit that is pronounced. On the back end of the flavor, there is some spices, ended by a dark chocolate bitterness. Alcohol heat is somewhat noticeable, I'm guessing this would mellow nicely with age. As to the style, I'm not really sure this belongs in the English Barleywine category. Maybe a American Strong Ale? Maybe an Old Ale? Regardless, this is a nice beer, and I'm planning to lay the other 3 down for a couple years and see what happens.","lnashsig","Jun 05, 2011"

Picking up lots of dark fruit, some toffee, vanilla, cherry, faint alcohol notes. A lot is going on but it all smells great. The taste is fantastic as well. A really complex beer. A barleywine that is definitely a more traditional English style with a big malt background. I'm loving the mix of flavors: Caramel/toffee/dark fruit/almond/vanilla/cherry/slight bourbon the list goes on and on. Low on the carbonation side, but drinks really smooth for 11%.

Smell: brown bread, big caramelized sugar hit, sugary dates, cherry-ish - here's where the bourbon barrel character comes in. Taste: raisin, sugary black plum flesh, dates, caramel, note of vanilla, and a bit vinous. The sugary fruit goodness is cut by oak character and twin (small) doses of earthy hops and alcohol.

Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, dark fruit, and sweet alcohol. The flavor was of sweet malt, dark fruit, caramel, nuttiness, and alcohol. It had a medium feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a decent brew. The alcohol on this one was very forward and almost invasive. It wouldn't have been bad if there was more sweetness to balance it out slightly. If you have a bottle of this I would suggest laying it down in your cellar for awhile to allow this heat to subside some so that more subtle flavors can make their way forward. Worth trying though fresh or aged.","thagr81us","May 04, 2011"

Taste is pretty much spot on with the nose. Loads of caramel, sugary sweetness reminiscent of smarties candy, light earthy, herbal bitterness, some oak in small amounts, and a touch of bourbon. This reminds why I like English Barleywines so much more than the American versions as the hops are subdued and don't overpower the toasty, caramelized malts. As it warms, more fruity characteristics some out including raisins, dates, and figs along with a more bread. This is good stuff! Almost full mouthfeel with light carbonation.

3.83,-7.7,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Insanity pours a crystal clear amber, with spots of ruby tracing the outer edge of the glass. The off-white head ends up at just over three fingers in height, and shows impressive staying power. Solid sized spots of lacing are left clinging to the sides of the glass as well. The nose has a little bit of toffee, but primarily consists of bourbon. It smells like an extremely smooth bourbon, but it's largely a one note aroma. Things open up a bit more in the flavor. Caramel is largely replaced by alcohol infused caramelized brown sugar. There's a suggestion of bitterness from hops, but it's noticeably restrained, even for an English style barleywine. The barrel presence is also quite prominent, a blend of vanilla and straight bourbon. The body is spot on for the style, although a little more slick than I'm used to. That might be in part due to the fact that the carbonation is just a little too low. Insanity is a pretty good beer fresh out of the gate, but I think a little bit of age will smooth out the bourbon character a bit more and transform this beer into something great.","axeman9182","Apr 15, 2011"

Good carbonation in the mouth accompanies a thinner, less creamy body than preferred versions of the style. The twinge of lingering bitterness and body make it less drinkable than it seems. This beer just doesn't come together like it might - and it has some age on it. I hate to say it, but this beer reflects it's price well. If ever presented with a $15 bomber of this or a similar beer, this is an awful deal. $3 12oz bottles, and you could do worse for a relatively strong barrel flavor in a barleywine. I don't remember how it tasted fresh, but it is not all that smooth now, so it might not some further time.","seeswo","Jan 04, 2011"

Vanilla and cherry play well together, with caramel hints and a dense grainy quality. Sticky resinous hops balance everything out well. Really full thick body and mouthfeel.

Taste is sweet upfront with the oak balancing some fruit, caramel, and melanoids. About midway and into the finish the higher alcohols take over and remind you that this one is 11+ abv. The finish is rather dry with that lingering caramel'd alcohol taste. Light carbonation, medium body with a dry finish, sweet syrupy mouthfeel. I like this one.

It's like Sean Connery's aftershave. It's full bodied and smooth with a very clean finish. There's lots of bourbon in the taste. It's like a beer interpretation of bourbon.

We're good now. Trust me. So, kiddies, when we slosh this bad boy around in our oral cavities (that's sciencey talk for ""cake hole""), what do we see with our taste buds? Definitely some honey, some more oak and bourbon, some maple syrup (can you say ""pancakes, bitches!""?), and some brown sugar. Do any of you have anything to add? No? Good, that means the treatment's working. Just let it glide up your spine, that's it. Isn't that nice? Oddly enough, kids, this brew flows just as thickly and gooily as that sensation you're feeling. Now, you're probably not gonna want to have seconds on the treatment (hell, you won't even need another: one's all you'll ever need, heh heh...), but those of you who eventually regain their memories will want to have another one of these. **ding-ding* Dr. Money, you are needed in the lobotomy lab stat* Whoa, gotta go, kids, but I'll be back real soon to check up on you.

Starts with raisins and chocolate, finishes with bourbon and candi sugar. Beer literally coats the mouth, giving it a long finish. Sweetness is well balanced and not cloying.

Strong, rich balanced aroma of vanilla, oak, bourbon, ripe dark fruits, but very little burn from alcohol like a fresh bottle. Obviously the hops and alcohol burn that are present fresh have now almost completely faded and this now resembles something like a port. Strong notes of raisin and dark fruits, and from the middle into the finish a complex balance of oak, vanilla, bourbon. Carbonation has held up well, supporting the medium-full smooth body.

I figured this would just be another chapter in my love affair with Weyerbacher, with the same old story and same predictable ending. But it is not at all. I thought the base beer was ok, but way too hot, and that's one of the things that I think is so surprising about this beer. It is not hot at all, and as I have mentioned a few times, it is exceptionally smooth for a beer of its strength. One of the best barrel aged beers I've ever had, as the bourbon character complements and adds to the beer instead of dominating and masking the base flavors. Again, I'm not sure how old this is, but I think it's certainly in the neighborhood of 2+ years, and I doubt this is as good when fresh. It's just so smooth and integrated. I'm very pleasantly surprised, and I will probably even pick up a few more to toss in the cellar.","number1bum","Nov 06, 2009"

Looks like 'the Idiot' aged well; let's have a taste...and the flavor didn't disappoint. Fruitiness hits you first, then vanilla/toffee/oak/earthiness, and finally a warm cherry-ish finish. Two things amazing about this beer: the smoothness (aka no sickeningly syrupy sweetness) and the lack of discernible alcohol. Very well-hidden alcohol content for a barleywine. That being said, this is still a sipping beer. Very well done, Weyerbacher.

I get whiskey, oak, grain alcohol, maple leafs and just a hint of dark fruit like raisins, figs and grapes. The taste starts sweet with some light dark fruitiness from dark grapes, raisins and maybe some plums. Then the oak and whiskey flavors take over and carry the experience into the finish. There are brief moments of sweet dark fruitiness and even some faint caramel. At the finish is a noticeable warming that borders on hotness. Not the type of brew I crave 22oz of.

Finally, with a bit of hops (but not enough to really lessen the impact of the others) coating the way, a huge sharp crack of wood alcoholic bite. That crack is both the most noticeable sensation, and the biggest drawback. Mouthfeel is solid, appropriately carbonated, overall medium in body, not real chewy at all, and doesn't cloy on the palate. Drinkability takes a huge hit from the big alcoholic bite. The baseline flavors are excellent, the sweet fruit mixed with the bourbon oaky edge. But when that bite kicks in, it is what takes this down from the awesome to very good but hard to drink.

The brown sugar, molasses, banana bread, licorice, whiskey, crème brûlée and tiramisu flavors slathered on you. Much to its credit the carbonation is able to at times offer safe haven. While the malts definitely in charge the hops do slip in some corn, field grass, mandarin orange and pine.

Known for their eccentric styles, this brew perfectly complements the typical Weyerbacher line with its strong, dominating flavor and taste... Nice ruby-red, light-copper appearance with minimal head and small lacing... smell is replete with dark-fruits, sweet, brown sugar, and figs... Taste strongly complements the aroma, with a distinct vanilla-bourbon flavor along with prunes, thick malts, and caramel sweetness... 11.1% ABV is certainly noticeable with a distinct alcohol presence... over-powering taste with a decent mouthfeel, but drinkability took a hit due to the powerful conglomeration of flavors...

For this one, it was the fruit and spice that accompanied the malts that made this such a pleasant experience. Most notably, the dark fruit (mostly plum I think) and vanilla came out right from the start in the nose and they carried through the warming alcohol presence to stay through the long finish. Enjoyable, thick malt flavors, with those wonderful woodsy notes that make you feel like you're snuggled in a thick quilt, sitting by a fire at your camp in a secluded section of the forest that is quieted by the newly fallen snow. <sigh> ok that reminds me of past ski trips too much. time to go.","ski271","Nov 09, 2007"

Mouthfeel was thick but of course that's what we expect. My only criticism of this beer is that it was a bit over-the-top for my tastes, which is why I gave a lower score for drinkability.

After a while, the palate fatigues a bit and the sweet-shock dissipates, allowing for the experiencing of some smoothness, teeth-coating sweetness, and significant alcohol burn at the very end. There are some fruits from the front to mid-palate, but really this is a big bomb o' sweetness from front to back. Overall, I would say this beer is too sweet and imbalanced.

The smell is bourbon, wood, sweet malts, and earthy hops. It (the smell) was the first thing I noticed about this beer. Only seconds after a I removed the cap, the smell was already in the air enough to *get my attention*. Taste was pretty assertive. You really have to be expecting this to enjoy it. I wasn't at first, and had to step back and re-evaluate my ""beer frame of mind"" before I could continue. Almost like expecting a DIPA and when you take a big mouthfull in, it turns out to be a Baltic Porter. If you can imagine the shock you would feel under those circumstances, that's about how I was with this one. Expecting one thing, and getting something entirely different. The taste, while good, is loaded with alcohol, and like a rich piece of cake, I got enough of this pretty quickly. There are also plenty of sweet malts here, as well as the ""cooked fruit"" note many people get from Belgian Tripels. Mouthfeel was great. Nice and thick; certainly full-bodied. I love a brew that just feels heavy in your mouth, and this one is definitely heavy. At 11,1% abv, this is certainly a sipper. I'll probably be working on this single 12oz'er for 45 minutes.

It allows more of the vanilla flavor to come through. Which was very pleasant. I commented several times on how smooth and drinkable this beer was. It is just that smooth. I bought this at a local store and drank it the same night, but believe it was from last years batch, so it was inadvertently aged nicely.

Toasted caramel malty sweetness, coconut, vanilla, rich sugary prunes, maybe a little piney hoppiness and a definite alcohol prescence in the aroma. Taste is some sweet caramel and vanilla followed by a hint of bitterness, with a nice big alcohol presence in the finish. Somewhat chewy, medium to heavy body. For an oak-aged beer, the sweet vanilla and oak/wood flavors and aromas were not too strong, which I preferred as some are too sweet in the taste and smell. I had sampled this beer before,(about 3 mos ago, a 12oz 05 bottle) and was dissapointed as it was all alcohol, almost like rubbing alcohol.

The fine, white bubbles formed a short cap and left some lacing behind. Strong whiskey component in the aroma, along with solid malt, caramel, and lighter vanilla. Sweet, malty flavour, again with whiskey, but more vanilla is present here. Oak rounds things out somewhat and alcohol is warm in the finish. Full body, low carbonation, quite smooth on the palate.

Hops come through in the nose and mingle with the oaky tones for a wood and bark feel. Alcohol spins a spicy layer of its own. The taste is wild and raw. Deliciously sweet. Candied and fermented. Vague hop balance cuts through the sweetness and gives this a bit of civility. The mouthfeel is medium with a bit of syrupy quality. The drinkability is good. Alcohol considered that is.

A nice dark amber, oranginsh beer. Looks like a strong ale/ big IPA. Sexy. The aroma is seductive, with wisps of booze, vanilla, bourbon, and burnt brown sugars. The taste is exotic. Huge doses of malt, aggressive hops, and a smooth alcohol warmth. The mouthfeel is very robust, almost coating the tongue in flavor. On top of this, it's a very approachable beer.

Not real strong but enticing none the less. Taste leaves the hops behind and goes with the malt, bourbon interplay. Begins caramelly, juices up with a lip smacking fruit flavor then goes more bourbony and woody. Vanilla and oak in the background. A nice chewy, bready base adds to the mouthfeel.

This scent is less sweet than Heresy, though, and more darkly fruity, like olives/raisins/dates. Tastes pretty strongly of those dark, sour fruits, combined with a vanilla, rummy alcohol taste. The bitter, hoppy finish surprised me--I didn't think there would be a hop presence.. It tastes like alcohol, but doesn't burn like it, so I would say the 11.1% ABV is hidden pretty well. Mouthfeel is very creamy. I'd like to sample some more barley wines so I get a feel for the style, but relative to all beers, this is an interesting one.

This is something to be savored, slowly and patiently, and not just because of that baldfaced ABV. Granted, sharing the bottle is by far the prudent move, for both your sobriety and your gullet, but I was in wonder as I drank every drop allotted.

The flavors are intensely malty and complex but very balanced and rounded with notes of sherry, dark dried fruit, and vanilla. The finish has a soft bitterness along with a warm alcohol sensation. The hops are kept in balance while many barleywines have a rough, burnt bitterness that lowers the drinkability in my opinion.

The nose is very strong; reminiscent of tobacco and brandy all the way. Wow, this brew is like having a meal. The mouthfeel is robust, heavy, and certainly chewy. Is this dinner? Yep. The taste buds tingle with a prominent smooth smokey maltiness that's accompanied by a tobacco edge as well as some clove beating around the bush. The finish is more brandy-like with clear punctuations of the high alcohol content this fine brew offers. Ultimately I sense some lingering licorice flavors on the back of the palate.

4.72,13.7,4,4.5,5,5,4.5,"This is the second release out of three in the oak-aged line of beers from Weyerbacher. The bottle opens with a decent release of gas; and with the yeast poured, it's a hazy dark chestnut with orange highlights beneath a thin head of creamy light tan foam that receeds quickly to just an average collar (of course, the 11% alcohol will help to do that!). The nose delivers a waft of bourbon, sweetish vanilla, drying woody oak, dried dark fruits, and a distinctly caramelish malt - as well as an occassional note of cocoanut! It's full, supple maltiness slides more oily than creamy across the tongue; and it's very-fine bubbled (seemingly natural) carbonation lends a gentle caress to the tongue. The flavor is rich and complex with a pleasant note of alcohol, vanilla, dark fruit skins, almonds, caramel/toffee, almost-burnt brown sugar, a lick of black licorice, wood, a low-key leafy hoppiness, and a rounding note of delicate, buttery diacetyl. WOW! It's not as malty or hoppy as most American versions, but keep in mind that this is based on British barleywines, many of which are more along these lines. On the other hand, however, it's at American barleywine strength! It finishes drying as it's alcohol and drying woodiness battle what residual maltiness is there; and more licorice flavor comes out as it warms. Quite impressive!","NeroFiddled","May 07, 2005"

I may spend the rest of the money in my bank account now on getting bottles just to have them. I believe this is the staple all barley wines should be trying to match. Not only that, but from most of the barley wines I've tried, the ""greenness"" factor is a huge variable. But with this young guy, it doesn't even matter, and it's perfect now. That, to me, means that if this gets better as it gets older, I'm in for a very tangible and effulgent form of pure perfection.","asabreed","May 06, 2005"

Unlike the Heresy, where the bourbon dominates, the bourbon takes a back seat here with oak, vanilla, and fruit really coming through.

Surprisingly mellow, I thought the bourbon-barrel aging might be a little too forceful. Malty and creamy rich, some tropical esters come through as well as a drier, woody finish from the barrel-aging. Some vanilla bean extract and maraschino cherry taste makes its way through.

It adds a smooth bourbon flavor to the already complex palate. The mouthfeel is good. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a damn good beer. I love the barrel aging. I hope to see more beers of the same style. It drinks well and warms stomach.","WesWes","Feb 14, 2005"

4.35,4.8,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"This beer was a pleasant surprise. Not as much of an aroma as I expected, definite creamy head, glowing cloudy blood-orange color. Hits you right away with a vanilla bourbon creaminess, strong malt flavor but not heavy. Kind of a ""sticky"" mouthfeel (I felt like I was getting a ""milk moustache"" drinking this stuff) but not overly sweet at all - I think cask-aging this takes some of the heady sweetness out of this barleywine's regular punch and helped balance it more. Light whiskey aftertaste mixed with a stronger oak aftertaste. Goes down really smooth. Unusually smooth. Dangerously smooth. I'll be buying this again, oh yes.","PopeJonPaul","Jan 29, 2005"
4.32,4.1,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"	Insanity poured out a just slightly hazy burnt orange color, with thin wispy white foam topping. Aroma give you a quick zap of bourbon barrel before immersing you in sweet malt, vanilla, vague fruitiness, and a hint of alcoholic zest. Taste proves to be surprisingly well rounded, bourbon barrel and oak come out at first, but only to serve as an introduction and accent, rather than the brutality of bourbon in some other barrel aged brews. Very candi sweet and caramely through the middle with a hint of peppery spice. Finish gives you a slight bitterness, light vanilla and a bit of anise even. Body is full, but not too thick. Quite drinkable for a big barleywine, and worthy of distinction from its blithering cousin.","mikeys01","Jan 27, 2005"

I think it's all about balance, which i didn't feel Heresy had, but Insanity most certainly does. An excellent brew for those looking for something a little different, and easily Weyerbacher's best product.","IrishMike","Jan 26, 2005"
4.62,11.3,4,4.5,5,5,4,"This beer pours with a nice deep dark reddish tint and a head that quickly goes away. It has a very nice vanilla aroma. The taste is different than any other barley wine I've erver had. Very malty with a bourbon, vanilla taste and an alcohol finish....very smooth.

4.4,6,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,"Pours a very deep clear brown with about one finger of head that disappears quickly but leaves a nice lace. First smell that hits you is that of bourbon, but it gradually gives way to an underlying maltiness doubled with an offsetting spicy nose. Very unique aroma that gets you excited for your first sip. Flavor itself is very interesting; it's bourbon-heavy with a good sweet-spicy balance before finishing extremely malty and vanilla with a wonderful malt aftertaste. The alcohol is extremely well-hidden for its potency, and the medium-bodied mouthfeel makes it much more drinkable than a lot of others in its weight class. I can't imagine wanting more than one at once, but I can see really enjoying this one on a snowy night.","whartontallboy","Jan 22, 2005"

3.12,-24.8,3,3.5,3,3,3,"Clear medium brown, no head. Light rummy and bourbony aroma presenting vanilla, and sadly no fruits at all, resulting in a simple sweet slightly woody and earthy array of flavors at which the integration is not all that. While I can name a few flavors, its not too complex and very candyish. Straight bourbon flavor also makes for a disappointing palate compared to the aroma. Astringent finish. Almost roasty finish feels a bit harsh. Alcohol is strong still. Creamy medium body is very liqurous, but this fits here. It feels like a run as fast as possible to follow a trend to me. Do they also run to catch the new seasons fashion clothe color? Or perhaps it was just released a little too early. Still, as it is: boring.","Rastacouere","Jan 22, 2005"

Woody aroma, with a strong bourbon/whiskey presence. Rich body, and the alcohol is not hidden in this one at all. Oak and toffee flavors are masked by the bourbon flavor at first, and the sting doesnt go away for awhile. The finish is dry and bitter. Pretty good beer but kind of hard to drink.","Dogbrick","Jan 17, 2005"

The aroma has some hop fruit ( grapefruit primarily)with some vanilla from the oak aging. I must say, this beer does well conditioned with the oak, The taste has more vanilla, even pecans up front. The hops show midway through the flavor with some hop flower and mild pine flavors. Malt shows late in the drink with a mild caramel sweetness. The oak aging lends a great silky mouth feel to the beer. Very drinkable. Weyerbecher needs to continue this oak aged series.","carln26","Jan 09, 2005"

4.52,8.9,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,4,"This beer looks like an antique cabinet. Dark reddish tints show through against the dark brown color. The colors blend together like wood grain. A thin creamy head sticks around for a while. Probably one of the strongest smelling beers I've come across. The closer you get your nose to the beer the more it smells like a straight up glass of whisky, straight from the rivers of Kentucky. Other sweeter scents are detectable too, such as dark cherries, vanilla, and sweet ripe mellow malts with a bit of a hop bitterness hiding somewhere in there. An amazingly aromatic brew. The taste is just as good. Sweet overly-ripe fruits (pears, berries, nectarines, whatever) hit the palate first, followed by a cherry vanilla sweetness. All the while you can definately feel a combination of a hop kick and an alcohol burn on the tongue. The %11 alcohol is noticable in the way that it warms the throat and stomach, but not overly present in the taste. This is an intrigueingly (real word?) complex beer. I like it. Very smooth and syrupy juicy mouthfeel, as is typical of the barley wine style. Drinkabilty is really surprisingly good considering the style and ABV of this beer. A real winner by Weyerbacher. This beer both exemplifies its style and also challenges it and defines it differently and originally, which I think is one of the highest achievements of brewing. I'll drink to that for sure.","twelvsies","Jan 07, 2005"
3.48,-16.1,4,3.5,3.5,4,3,"Thick, creamy, dark tan head holds strong. Deep, hazy, mahogany colored beer with a ruby hue. Fairly strong aroma; a bit of whiskey up front with some woody vanilla that almost comes together smelling like coconut. There's whiskey all over the flavor as well, but there's also some nice dark malty fruit and some more caramel/vanilla. Finish is slightly alcoholic, and ultimately pretty clean. Warms the stomach up real nice. Body is on the thick side as expected and helps to coat your tongue in flavor. Whiskey tones are strong, but not as detracting as in the Heresy. While not one of my favorites, this is a solid beer with plenty going on to keep me interested.","HappyHourHero","Jan 05, 2005"

Taste starts with a malt presence and a distinct alcohol pop. A smooth maltiness hits on the mid-palate with the hint of vanilla...ends in alcohol and hop kick,,,pretty smooth for the abv. Why does this remind me of fine whiskey....must be the oak. Mouthfeel is extremely smooth for the abv...very surprising. Easy enough to drink, but honestly, I could feel the power early on...just one a night is fine....enjoy....keep those oak casks going Weyerbacher...a good complement to Heresy, which I understand will be brewed year round.","edchicma","Jan 05, 2005"
4.37,5.3,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,"Poured a dense clowdy brownish red, with a small thin head. A rich, thick nose with a hint of black licorice, black cherry and dark chocolate. A dense malty richness with a hint of port wine stuck at the sides makes this a real treat for the palate - the mouthfeel is not as heavy as one might expect which makes the hard to find 11% abv that much more dangerous. Definitely a great winter beer, and one that I hope to have more of in the future.","stingo","Jan 04, 2005"

4.56,9.9,5,4,5,5,4,"Taste is complex to the nth degree, justifying the ""Insanity"" name. No hop monster, this one. Very unique flavor profile compared to other barleywines I've sampled. This one is smooth and creamy, satiny, in fact, without any rough edges. Vanilla and oak tones are prominent, with a kiss of premium Kentucky bourbon warmth. Cherries, raisins, and toasted caramel apple notes add to the intrigue. Alcohol harshness is totally missing other than the bourbon warmth. Damn! This one leaves me at a loss of descriptive words. It is so complex, that Insanity is all I can come up with. Incredible, sums up the experience of sipping this one for over an hour. Very drinkable, but in a very slow manner. Take your time with this one. It is foolish, nay, insane, to try more than one of these a month. Weyerbacher has produced a classic with this one.","merlin48","Jan 03, 2005"
4.35,4.8,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"a dark burnt sienna color, with hues of ruby. a darker color then the texas longhorns uniform shade of orange, not the best description i know, but that is the ebst way to describe the color. off white/tanish head that sticks around makeing me grow impatient cause i want to get a sip, but the head is so large i know it will be one of those circumstances when you get a nose full of foam, so you must wait. smells of over ripened fruit, malty sweetness, and a slight burn of alcohol. when the sip first hits your tounge it is dark cherries, but as you swallow it fades to a sweeter currant flavor. plum and malty sweetness also exist along with the pungent taste of alcohol. when it is cold the hops hit you kind of ahrsh as you would expect from an american style barley wine, but as it warms this fdes to a nice smoothness. the only tihng ditracting from the smoothness is the obvious alcohol taste. some sips this alcohol taste is a deterent, but on most it compliments the style and the beer. somewhat heavy and light on carbonation. swirling it in the glass doesnt even seem to stir a thin coat of foam. very good, much smoother then some other american versions of this style. i wonder how aging will treat this beer, already smooth, and not overly hoppy, i would hope more vanillia flavors might perk from the barrel aging as well as the fruit notes coming out more whole heartedly.","MediocreatBest","Jan 02, 2005"
4.11,-1,4.5,3.5,4.5,4,4,"This 22 oz. bomber was shipped as part of the BIF X-Mas package by shippos. I saved it for the grand finale of the experience. When I poured the beer into a goblet, it had a deep red color, and a clear body. A fizzy one inch thick head formed while pouring, but soon dissipated to a quarter of its original size. The aroma was relatively mild, and reminded me of toffee, pears, powdered cocoa, and vanilla. The taste was divinely mellow with oak aged vinous dry notes shining through each sip. The malt presented itself as raisin, cherry, raspberry, and subtle hints of dark chocolate. The mouthfeel was medium thick and a bit prickly. The alcohol was very boozy and hot, detracting from being able to down this one quickly. For those of you that can get this, Id recommend some ageing in the bottle for additional improvements.","rajendra82","Jan 01, 2005"

The nose is very sweet, some nice sweet cherry with a very oaky vanilla touch that balances things out a lot. The flavor is really nice. A bit of dark fruit, but a bit of vanilla and bourbon flavors, but not as much as the Heresy. The feel is very thick and full. Drinkability is nice on this as well.

An aroma heavy of elements of malt, caramel, and red wine. The flavor consisted of malt, caramel, wood and red wine. The body was medium with the finish being slightly astrigent with vinous characteristics. The overall combination of characteristics of this beer really made it stand out. Drinkabilty of barley wines/old ales like this is always tough to measure.","Wildman","Dec 23, 2004"

They have elevated the Blithering Idiot barleywine to new heights by cask aging it in bourbon barrels. The appearance is dark amber with garnet hightlights. Head is opaque and shows nice traces of lace as the beer is enjoyed. The nose exhibits traces of vanilla with strong hints of bourbon. The flavor develops as the ale warms. Starts out with luscious vanilla and woody notes with stronger hints of bourbon the longer you enjoy it. This is a serious beer that is seriously delicious. I highly recommend it!!","maltydog","Dec 22, 2004"

The smell was of oak, burbon, and a beautiful fruity sweetness, the alcohol is masked nicely. The taste started off fruity and caramel sweetness , then moved into a vanilla and whiskey flavor, and finished with a smooth touch of alcohol and oak. Acutally, there was a touch of oak across the entire taste experience. The mouthfeel was smooth as slik, perfectly carbonated and had excellent body. WOW! This is one bad ass beer!

The head sticks around for an unusually long time and leaves a decent amount of lacing around the glass. Aroma is of ripe dark fruits with a malty sweetness. Notes of vanilla, woodiness and alcohol are also in the mix. Quite a full and complex aroma that might take me a few bottles to figure out. Taste starts off with sweet fruits and a touch of caramel. There are some notes of vanilla and bourbon characteristics as well. Quite a mix of flavors going on here and every thing seems to balance each other out quite nicely. There is also some toasty malt in there as well and it ends with a light alcohol burn. Simply awesome. Mouthfeel is full, thick and creamy with a slight warmth to it. Excellent drinkability here, I could drink this all night or as long as I could stay awake.

The smell isnt quite as intense as some barleywines, but its certainly multi-dimensional. The taste is simply extraordinary. Fullness of flavor is an understatementyoure almost consumed by the taste. Malt, alcohol, whiskey and wood, touch of yeast, dab of hops, over-ripe fruit, molasses, and on and on. Superb flavor with an alcohol bite. Thick, full, heavy body.
