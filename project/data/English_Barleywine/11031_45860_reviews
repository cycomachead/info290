"O - Good barleywine.  Do not drink with dinner.  Drink this with dessert.  Dinner probably biased my review heavily.  3.75/5"
"Top notch barley wine. Good on a cold night."
""
"Absoutely fantastic.  Almost closer to a port than a beer.  Where can I find more!?"
"Sweeter barleywine. No carbonation. Decent offering, but not for everyone."
"Tastes sweet, with dark caramel upfront and a slight bitterness at the end, which somehow survives in the aftertaste. Feels syrupy with medium body and low carbonation. Absolutely fantastic!"
"O: I got this on Wishbeer, Thailand, drank in Kunming on January 9th, 2015. Its that time of year to have this one, especially on the day of the first snow in our city!  Memories of having barley wine with my bro in Canada this around this time of year."

"Whoa! this is a Wiley monster. Poured with a traditional tiny fine off-white head, a little lace and a hazy/cloudy dark honey amber color. Aroma is wet grain, malt, figs, a bit of citrus, a hint of yeast. flavor is like aroma but the first thing that jumps out is the sweet tartness. The citrus is an interesting twist for Barley Wine. It pretty much Hides most of the Malt. The body is perfect. Alcohol is well hidden. This is a good ass Beer, By cracky."

"330 ml bottle into snifter, bottled on 8/24/2011. Pours hazy/cloudy dark ruby red color with minimal head or lacing. Some light carbonation bubbles linger at the surface. Aromas of big raisin, plum, fig, date, apple, caramel, molasses, toast, toffee, brown bread, brown sugar, light leather, herbal, and herbal/toasted earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark fruitiness and dark/bready malt sweetness; with good strength. Taste of big raisin, plum, fig, date, apple, caramel, molasses, toast, toffee, brown sugar, brown bread, light leather, herbal, and herbal/toasted earthiness. Light earthy herbal bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of raisin, plum, fig, date, apple, caramel, molasses, toast, toffee, brown sugar, brown bread, herbal, and toasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Damn nice complexity and balance of dark fruitiness and rich dark/bready malt flavors; with a good malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Light carbonation and very full bodied; with very slick and fairly syrupy mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice English barleywine. All around good complexity and balance of dark fruitiness and rich dark/bready malt sweetness; and very smooth to sip on for the big ABV. A very enjoyable offering."

"Pours a two-finger off-white head that fades very slowly leaving a good lace. Cloudy amber color, some yeast left in bottle. Medium carbonation and medium bodied. Sweet almost syrupy nose and flavor is sweet toffee, not cloying, high ABV is hidden. Pricey at $11.99 for a 330ml bottle from Julio's Liquors Westborough, Ma. Brewed Jul 2012."

"Poured deep maple with a very slight trail of bubbles. Perfectly clear, the light produces a brilliant deep amber glow. Lots of caramel and toffee here. Very nicely balanced sweetness that lasts the entire sip followed by an earthy bitterness. Low carbonation works for this sipper. Thick and chewy body. Quite an awesome beer indeed!"

"There is almost no alcohol in the taste which is impressive. There are lots of mineral-chalk in this one, a bit too much I think."

"o: The label says this can age for 25 years. Wouldn't this just get sweeter and sweeter over time? Anyway, this was interesting to try but I think I would have preferred a fresher bottle with a stronger hop presence."
""

"De Molen Bommen & Granaten ---3.5/5"
""
""
""
"OVERALL: This is big. Very big. Maybe too big. Very sweet and lots of grainy flavors. Every time I have this I'm reminded that it's just not really my thing. The cascade dry hopped version was excellent, as the hop flavor overtook the sweet, grainy flavor that can be so dominating here. Let's see how the Bordeaux version is."
""
""
"Overall: Very disappointed in this beer. Not worth trying especially at the price point. It's a very simple brew but the few notes it does have are not particularly enjoyable and the body comes off thin for what should be a huge barley wine."
""
""
""
"And I still got the Cascade Dryhopped and Bordeaux Barrel Aged version to review."
"D - Fantastic bold and rich barleywine. Great overall balance."
""
"Overall, a good and super strong barley wine. I'd like to try one after a few years in the cellar."
""
""
""
"The mouth let's it down. Just not pleasant to drink. No carbonation whatsoever. A real shame, because the flavour profile is really nice."
""
"Bottle courtesy of ygtbsm94. Served in a sampler glass. Pours a medium caramel color with no real head, though none is expected from a brew like this. Nose is strong malt and sweetness with some fruit in the background. Flavor has quite a bit of sweetness drowning out some of the subtleties from the nose. Medium-full body. A bit viscous. Some booze. Pretty good."
""
"Overall, this is a stand-up barleywine that hides it's deadly ABV nicely. Just a bit too sweet."
""
"O: Very intense barleywine. Very big, very sweet and fruity. A sipper for sure, especially since it is dead flat. But surprisingly not as harsh as you'd think and surprisingly balanced for what you get. To be honest, I enjoyed it as a really unique and strong barleywine."
"O: I don't see this beer going anywhere good. Meh."
"Bottle: Poured a transparent amber color ale with zero head. Aroma of dry fruits, oxidation and sweet corn notes is quite intense. Taste is also dominated by warm alcohol ester notes with some corn, some oxidized caramel malt notes with intense dry fruit and loads of residual sugar. Body has an oily like texture with zero carbonation and loads of alcohol was apparent. This was bottle in 2010 and is supposedly good for another 25 years! I can’t say I was very impressed with this beer as way too much alcohol and sugar was perceptible. There seems to be a trend of zero carbonation and high-gravity beer with no attenuation and I just don’t get it."
""
""
"Verdict: So much potential here, wonderful aroma, great flavorings, but just poor delivery. The lack of any carbonation ruins any hope of having a good experience with this beer, perhaps it's just the age of the bottle, and maybe some oxidation setting in, although it really didn't taste like that was the case and many other reviewers, even of fresher bottles have complained about the mouthfeel as well, so I'm not convinced."

"*I originally gave this one a C+, but it gets considerably better as it warms, letting the fig notes come out. I adjusted my score to a B-."

"330ml bottle. Snifter glass. Review on jul´12. Reddish amber color. Foggy appearance. Yellowish beige, medium to small bubbled, froth creates creamy, fairly good retention, crown. Noble hop, spicy, intense caramel malt & candy aromas with hints of cinnamon. Sweet caramel malts, very ripe fruits –peach & apricot-, gentle warming & subtle bitterness at first sip. Buttery, plentiful & voluptuous palate. Raisin & sweet grapefruit in the middle. Full body, low carbonation. Smooth, creamy, slightly earthy finish. Aftertaste carries sugar cane, brown sugar & soft rhum-like hues. Amazing well balanced flavors & aromas. Delightful. Mandatory beer!!! Comment: Last year I enjoyed a 750ml bottle. I remember it so delicious but no notes were taken. Well, looking at labels I´ve realized: 750ml ltd. Ed. -#113- bottle 24,3EBC 53,9IBU but 330ml bottle 45EBC 57IBU."

"Beer is like port, raisins and grapes with a fortified liquor quality to it, interesting but not great. I liked it but wouldn't have much of it."
"Strong, syrupy aroma is rather sweet, not really like beer at all, with notes of molasses and honey. It pours a clear, dark cola brown with a skimpy head that doesn’t hang around long. Flavor is quite sweet, more like wine than beer - and watch out for that alcohol bite! Well, look at the ABV and then wonder why it bites like an angry pit bull. Texture is rather like a hard liquor, mainly raw alcohol bite with some sweet and fruity and molasses hints. I prefer a beer that smells, tastes and feels like beer. However, different strokes for different folks."

"Best in small quantities, I certainly enjoyed my portion. I would have this again."
"EBU: 53.9"

"De Molen rocks when it comes to their wide range of Imperial Stouts, but otherwise, their successes are few and far between imo."
""
"O: This is so sweet I can't handle it. It's as thick as eggnog, too. Some carbonation in this would bring it back to life, but there is none. Too bad these small pieces bring down an otherwise excellent beer."
""
"O - good, quality beer. Not what I was expecting but well balanced between esters, malt and bitters. I cellared one and imagine this will be excellent in 5 to 10 years."
"Particular, it is, however, that the beer which is to settle, so that there is a slight emulsion, the bottom of the glass remains in place, which is similar to the grenadine."
"O: Pretty basic Barleywine but a pretty sweet one. The abv is there but you can't really tell its at 15%."
"O: Really tasty, and very flavorful, but it would help out if it was carbonated. Impressive stuff though. I can't really think of any other beer that fits this much of a malt profile into the flavor with this high of an abv without being obscenely boozey. Glad to try it, and I wonder how a bottle would taste with 25 years of age on it."
"A sweet and sticky dessert."
""
""
""
"The bottle is about 3 years old. Though still over barring and unpleasant. Not something I will touch again for a long, long time. If ever."
"Surprisingly this is also my mother's favourite of all the beers I have given her."
""
""
"This goes well with B&J Super Fudge Chunk and Whipped cream!"
"Interesting bottle - very artisanal label with a thin, rather oily, red wax coating over the metal cap. Pour was dark chestnut with little head. Very low level of carbonation, bordering on flat. Heavy dose of brown sugar with prune and dried fruit in the background. ETOH was prominent and biting, stabbing through the sweetness with a jagged edge. Finish was overly-sweet and cloying. Unfortunately, I'm just not digging this beer."
"Syrupy feel to it, no carbonation and that surprises me a little bit given the abv and bottle conditioning. Boozey on the end. Glad it was the small bottle"
"O- obviously too strong to drink more than one of, and the one i drank took me some time. a definite sipper, but very enjoyable. ill definitely be picking some more of this up to see how it ages. the bottle claims it can stand up after 25 years in a cellar."
"overall: Thanks to my buddy for a fantastic birthday present that included this. A very unique and wonderful concoction."
"Overall: Not bad, but not $10 good. I much prefer the Heaven and Hell which is also by Brouwerij De Molen, but costs $1 less. Won't be purchasing again, far too sweet for me"
"overall: not de molen's finest work, but a dangerously drinkable abv monster"
"I would like to see what time does to this beer though, it says on the back you can age it up to 25 years. Maybe I am drinking it prematurely but who knows..."
"(330cl bottle from Bruery Provisions. Bottle #2013/2304). Pours cloudy mahogany with no head and some floaties. Aroma has loads of fruit--green apple, orange, some caramel and a bit of alcohol. Taste is sweet with a bit of bitterness on the end. Alcohol is noticeable, but it doesn’t show 15%. Not bad, but not terribly complex."
"Overall, I think this is far too boozy."
"O/D - Nice barleywine. Nice and fruity and refreshing on the sunny day. Weak aroma but flavour is what counts for me, so this was good."
"(D)- A good english barlewyine. Much too strong for everyday enjoyment, but a good sipper to enjoy. The bottle says this can be cellared for up to 25 years. . I would be curious to put this to the test and see what happens."
"A good English Barleywine with nice flavours. The alcohol levels are very noticeable but on the whole it works."
"Cheers, Molen!"
"Notes: Quite a progression brew, if one likes it this is the one that goes from blah (appearance) to quite outstanding. I´d love to have a couple around for the aging. Thanks Toño, once again, for the treat."
"D: It says it can age 25 years and I believe it, a good place to start. Definitely needs to age and bring more complexities to the forefront. Glad to try it."
"overall - kind of a let down. I've got another bottle, and given that it says it can age 25 years, maybe i'll give that a go. it is very drinkable, especially given the abv."
"Yeah, a very heavy drop, but it is quite pleasant for the most part. A good sipper - could see it being served as an after-dinner beer."
"No, this is too much, as far as I'm concerned. This is a beer that has gone way too far one way and has become unbalanced and difficult to drink. Maybe you're not meant to drink it - maybe you're meant to pour it over ice cream as some sort of sickly delicious sugar syrup, but as a beer, even to sip, it's beyond redemption."
"D: It's a sipper, but remarkably easy drinking for a 15% ABV, undercarbed barleywine. I'm probably going to pick up another bottle or two, as I'm very curious how this will do with some age on it."
"In all not as good as others i ve had but may have it again."
"Not what I want out of a beer, but certainly an enjoyable example of the style. Truly something that people will enjoy and certainly worthy of having sampled. At 12 bucks a bottle, over a dollar and oz, won't be something I do again, and frankly I'm ok with that."
"Overall, the smell was really incredible, but the taste was just down right unpalatable."
"All in all, an interesting brew. It's a phenomenal sipper, but not a personal favorite of mine. Something needs to be done about that mouthfeel before I give this one another look - just too flat."
"D-big malt bomb, a little sweet but not cloying, the huge flavors and the big body go well together. more carbonation would probably have helped balance and reduce some of the big sugar flavors in this."
"This barleywine is as classic flavored as they come; similar to the well-aged J.W. Lees and Tom Hardy's ales."
"Overall this was a big still barleywine - certainly on the sweet side but after a certain ABV it's almost impossible to make them otherwise. I'd enjoy seeing beers over 12% available in the Rogue nip bottles as 12 oz. is almost always too much. Anyways, it's a tasty beer that's worth a shot."
"This is a sipper - very sweet, like a dessert wine. Not the best body in a barleywine but pretty drinkable, especially for the ABV."
"All in all, this was a good brew. Had some interesting notes to it. The taste was a lot better than the scent gave of and the drinkability was a lot better than you would have thought for 15% ABV. Good brew!"
"Chewy fuller body with sweetness from malt and alcohol but not much heat. Abv well masked. Very drinkable toffee caramel raisin dark frut burn toward the end sweet"
"Wow..."
"Traded from the Netherlands. Pours a rich dark brown colour with a little head, noneby the end of the bottle. Fairly full mouthfeel, supplemented by lots of caramel. This is sweet and apricot fruity. Very sweet, this is one year old of its stated 25 year life, and should be even more interesting after five years. Drinkable and super high alcohol is hidden."
"750mL courtesy of RB's own madmitch76. The pour is orange copper with thin off white head. The aroma is really pungent and fruity with apricots and pears to go along with spicy to earthy hops and some mild heat at the end of the draw. The taste is sweet syrupy with malts, pears, skinless ripe red apple wedges and apricot fruitiness. It smoothly moves into notes of spicy and earthy hops. The booze kicks in and helps dry it out at the end to help balance out the load of sweetness going on here."
"Overall: Not what I expected. The beer is really too sweet for my pellet. It needs a bit more bitterness to balance the taste. The alcohol however, is extremely well hidden, I wish alcohol was this well hidden in my favorite barley wine (the Sam Smith strong golden). The absence of any carbonation and lack of bitterness makes this beer more like a very sweet liquor. Nice for after dinner, but not if one wants a beer."
"D: If there wouldn't be the grains, this could be mistaken for an Italian desert wine like malvasia. With some carbonation and some aging to reduce the sugar content this might have been a great barley wine. I'm waiting until I hear about a batch with carbonation then I will surely try and review it again."
"D: A really good beer. Very taste and characterful. It's definitely a sipper, but it's impressive that a beer as sweet as this one is so balanced. The vinous and liqueur-like qualities in this one is superb. But it would have been so nice if there was some carbonation."
"750ml bottle from the May '08 brewing. The cork comes loose silently, and pouring it proves there is indeed very little carbonation, if any. The beer is surprisingly clear, with a bright copper body and some traces of a would-be foam collar. Looks like a liqueur, and the similarities don't stop there. Smells incredibly sweet, with brown sugar and fruit notes. Lots of orange character. Very boozy; taking a big whiff, it burns the nostrils. Caramel, brown sugar, and honey in the taste, again with a good deal of fruit. There is a surprising amount of bitterness there, though it's easily overpowered by the sweet finish. No real alcohol bite, just a very warming finish. Thick feel that is quite syrupy. Normally not the kind of beer that I really go for, but I think the lack of carbonation is really what lets it work. Rather than thinking about this as a beer, it comes off as being much more akin to a typical dessert liqueur. Definitely a sipper, and not something I want to have more than a 6oz serving of, but then again, one can just recork the bottle and not have to worry about losing carbonation. Really interesting for what it is."
"Sampled on tap at the Pre-ZBF festival at Alivnne. The beer poured a cloudy orange body with an off white head that ran away rather quickly. The nose had yeast notes, some citrus character and a bit of alcohol as well. The taste was pretty intense with some alcohol notes, fruit character, orange and a nice hop character and spice as well. Overall a full bodied beer that improved as it warms and the nose and body open up."
"I had 7 bottles of the stuff. 6 of them from a batch in March and 1 from June. The brewer already mentioned that he was more satisfied with the second batch and oh my god! what a great evening filling beer this is. The first batch was great, but it looked horrible and imo it was also too much on the sweet side. The second batch however is a real improvement on those faults. The beer is still very sweet but in a good way because of the strong bitterness underneath and the filling thickness. It's a dessertbeer for sure. After a good heavy meal you should open up a bottle and when done finish it off with a glass of Lagavulin to make the evening perfect! I'm glad I have 5 bottles left. Let's see how they develop over the next 5 years or so."
"Bottle 175 of 477 from 6/17/08 bottling. Neat presentation, comes in a wood crate marked 'danger'. After pulling out a prybar/nail puller, I'm ready to begin. Beer pours a very hazy medium copper, plenty of evidence of bottle conditioning. No head to speak of, a few traces of whitish bubbles cling around the edge of the glass, but it appears fairly still. Aroma is a very nice blend of orange and sweet honey, much like a dessert or after dinner drink, maybe a liqueur. Also some notes of strawberry, sweet sugary caramel, coconut, a bit of bready yeastiness and a burning at the nostrils indicating a good sized alcohol presence. Taste follows the aroma with oranges and honey dominating, a toasty yeastiness rides over the tongue behind these flavors. Sweet sugary caramel blends with a bite of alcohol in the finish. Mouthfeel is on the thick side due to the nearly non-existant carbonation, slightly syrupy, but not too heavy, at least in moderate quantities. Bite of alcohol towards the finish leads into a very warming finish, perfect for a cold night. A nice treat from De Molen, I felt the lack of carbonation was both pleasing in that it allowed some strong sweet liqueur like flavors to come thru, but also allows the sugariness to come thru, possibly limiting how much one can enjoy in a sitting. A delicious sipper imo, the low/no carbonation and sweetness make for a fine night cap, glad to have one to lay down for a few years and see what develops."
