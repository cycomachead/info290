4.16,3,4.25,4.5,4,3.75,4.25,"I have no idea what this beer was like fresh. I only scored one bottle and I sat on it a couple years before drinking it. I was very impressed, though the feel was a bit thin for my liking and after two years it still provided a good blast of alcohol burn on the finish. Bourbon barrel aging is perfect for an English barleywine and this one shows all the wonderful qualities you'd look for. I rate this one slightly above Insanity, yet far, far behind Sucaba and BCBW. If I ever got another bottle, I'd age it a little bit longer before drinking (3 years minimum).","deadonhisfeet","Dec 10, 2014"

Smells like vanilla, caramel, marshmallow, toffee, fig, bourbon. Beautiful. Flavor is gifs and bourbon, a blast of vanilla on the finish, slight oxidization but not bad. Mouthfeel starts rich and thick, but with very low carbonation that seems to make this feel a little thin. Some more carb would help the mouthfeel. Very nice beer that I would like to try fresh.","BMMillsy","Mar 21, 2014"

Very malt forward, with no real hop presence, which is expected of the style. The booze is covered up very nicely. Cereal Killer is my go to barleywine and the bourbon takes it to the next level.

Yes, the mouthfeel could be fuller, and it is a barrel forward beer, which I don't mind, but I find it complex enough. It's doing all the right things for the style, so I don't really agree with some of the BA reviewers on this one. But to each his own. On that note, seek this one out if you think you can dig it. Looking forward to BA Shipwreck!","Googs","Aug 16, 2013"

Served in a DFH snifter, the beer pours a dark reddish/mahogany brown color with about a quarter inch tan head that didn't stay around for too long. There's also a small amount of lacing. The aroma is rich and malty, the brew smells like bourbon, caramel, brown sugar, toffee, oak, and a bit of booze. Taste is similar to the aroma, but with the addition of some molasses and raisins. There's also a surprising amount of bitterness in this brew, although the sweet malty flavors are stronger. Mouthfeel/body is medium/full, it's slick and easy enough to drink for a 12% ABV brew. Moderate carbonation. I thought this was a good brew, hopefully I can pick up another bottle in the future. $7.99 a bottle.","bluejacket74","Jun 23, 2013"

3.86,-4.5,4,4.25,3.75,3.5,3.75,"o - Overall I had high hopes for this one, especially after smelling it, but the taste just has too much alcohol up front at the moment. It gets considerably better as it warms up, but it is very strong. It's a little overcarbonated but the nose is great. I'd rank this slightly behind the BA stout, and way behind the BA porter, though I could see this being much better with more time on it. Will hold onto my other bottle for a while, at least a year.","mdfb79","Mar 31, 2013"

I'd have to try another regular Cereal Killer to get an accurate idea of what the barrel is really adding here, but it isn't anything super obvious. A little more body a less alcohol would make a big improvement in my perception of this beer.","zachary80","Mar 22, 2013"

4.22,4.5,4,4.5,4.25,3.5,4.25,"Overall I thought this was a good beer and a good example of the style, it had almost all the aspects that I expect from the style with lots of malt, bourbon Barrel and warming alcohol and it's a great beer for a cold winter night like tonight. This beer had ok drinkability, it was fairly smooth and the flavors held my attention, but the high amount of sweetness and warming alcohol would prevent me from having another, one 12oz bottle is the perfect amount and it's a great format for this beer. What I liked the most about this beer was the aroma and the balance in the taste, they were both pretty good and worked well with this beer. What I liked the least about this beer was the mouthfeel, it wasn't bad, but the body was just too thin for the style and it needs to be thicker and chewier. I would buy this beer again, if they choose to release it again, it's already gone in my area for the year, but I made sure to grab two extra bottles to throw in the cellar and I will be interested to see how it ages and I'll try and update this review, but the price is on the steep side, if it was anymore than $7.49 I don't think I would buy it, but I would recommend this to anyone who likes bourbon barrel aged beers. All in all I was happy with this beer, it didn't blow my mind and I think I like the Barrel aged Shipwreck Porter a little more, but this was still a good beer that I enjoyed drinking and it was a nice sipper and it's a good cold night treat. Good job Arcadia, thanks for bottling this beer, it's nice to have a tasty barrel aged Barleywine while I wait for the next release of Shipwreck Porter, I think 22 months is the perfect amount of time for this beer to sit in the barrel and it's worth the wait, keep up the good work guys.. 2014 EDIT, just tried one from my cellar that's year old, it got very smooth, almost as smooth as the three year old special edition, the bourbon barrel is toned down a little but it still comes through with some great toffee, caramel, and dark fruit flavors, It aged well and I like that it's smoother, but I think I prefer the fresh bottle since the barrel aspect was more apparent. still got one left that I might wait a year to try.","StoutHunter","Jan 28, 2013"

This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer that is tasty but has a better smell in my opinion.","UCLABrewN84","Jan 20, 2013"
